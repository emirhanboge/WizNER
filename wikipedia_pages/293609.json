    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, the indefinite orthogonal group, is the &lt;a href=\"Lie%20group\"&gt;Lie group&lt;/a&gt; of all &lt;a href=\"linear%20transformation\"&gt;linear transformation&lt;/a&gt;s of an \"n\"-&lt;a href=\"dimension%20of%20a%20vector%20space\"&gt;dimensional&lt;/a&gt; real &lt;a href=\"vector%20space\"&gt;vector space&lt;/a&gt; that leave invariant a &lt;a href=\"nondegenerate%20form\"&gt;nondegenerate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"symmetric%20bilinear%20form\"&gt;symmetric bilinear form&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"signature%20of%20a%20quadratic%20form\"&gt;signature&lt;/a&gt; , where . It is also called the pseudo-orthogonal group or generalized orthogonal group. The dimension of the group is .\nThe indefinite special orthogonal group, is the &lt;a href=\"subgroup\"&gt;subgroup&lt;/a&gt; of consisting of all elements with &lt;a href=\"determinant\"&gt;determinant&lt;/a&gt; 1. Unlike in the definite case, is not connected \u2013 it has 2 components \u2013 and there are two additional finite index subgroups, namely the connected and , which has 2 components \u2013 see \"\" for definition and discussion.\nThe signature of the form determines the group up to &lt;a href=\"isomorphism\"&gt;isomorphism&lt;/a&gt;; interchanging \"p\" with \"q\" amounts to replacing the metric by its negative, and so gives the same group. If either \"p\" or \"q\" equals zero, then the group is isomorphic to the ordinary &lt;a href=\"orthogonal%20group\"&gt;orthogonal group&lt;/a&gt; O(\"n\"). We assume in what follows that both \"p\" and \"q\" are positive.\nThe group is defined for vector spaces over the &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt;s. For &lt;a href=\"Complex%20number\"&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; spaces, all groups are isomorphic to the usual &lt;a href=\"orthogonal%20group\"&gt;orthogonal group&lt;/a&gt; , since the transform formula_1 changes the signature of a form. This should not be confused with the &lt;a href=\"indefinite%20unitary%20group\"&gt;indefinite unitary group&lt;/a&gt; which preserves a &lt;a href=\"sesquilinear%20form\"&gt;sesquilinear form&lt;/a&gt; of signature .\nIn even dimension , is known as the &lt;a href=\"%23Split%20orthogonal%20group\"&gt;split orthogonal group&lt;/a&gt;.\nExamples.\nThe basic example is the &lt;a href=\"squeeze%20mapping\"&gt;squeeze mapping&lt;/a&gt;s, which is the group of (the identity component of) linear transforms preserving the &lt;a href=\"unit%20hyperbola\"&gt;unit hyperbola&lt;/a&gt;. Concretely, these are the matrices formula_2 and can be interpreted as \"hyperbolic rotations,\" just as the group SO(2) can be interpreted as \"circular rotations.\"\nIn physics, the &lt;a href=\"Lorentz%20group\"&gt;Lorentz group&lt;/a&gt; is of central importance, being the setting for &lt;a href=\"electromagnetism\"&gt;electromagnetism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"special%20relativity\"&gt;special relativity&lt;/a&gt;. (Some texts use for the Lorentz group; however, is prevalent in &lt;a href=\"quantum%20field%20theory\"&gt;quantum field theory&lt;/a&gt; because the geometric properties of the &lt;a href=\"Dirac%20equation\"&gt;Dirac equation&lt;/a&gt; are more natural in .)\nMatrix definition.\nOne can define as a group of &lt;a href=\"matrix%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;matrices&lt;/a&gt;, just as for the classical &lt;a href=\"orthogonal%20group\"&gt;orthogonal group&lt;/a&gt; O(\"n\"). Consider the formula_3 &lt;a href=\"diagonal%20matrix\"&gt;diagonal matrix&lt;/a&gt; formula_4 given by\nThen we may define a &lt;a href=\"symmetric%20bilinear%20form\"&gt;symmetric bilinear form&lt;/a&gt; formula_6 on formula_7 by the formula\nwhere formula_9 is the standard &lt;a href=\"inner%20product\"&gt;inner product&lt;/a&gt; on formula_7.\nWe then define formula_11 to be the group of formula_3 matrices that preserve this bilinear form:\nMore explicitly, formula_11 consists of matrices formula_15 such that\nwhere formula_17 is the &lt;a href=\"transpose\"&gt;transpose&lt;/a&gt; of formula_15.\nOne obtains an isomorphic group (indeed, a conjugate subgroup of ) by replacing \"g\" with any &lt;a href=\"symmetric%20matrix\"&gt;symmetric matrix&lt;/a&gt; with \"p\" positive eigenvalues and \"q\" negative ones. Diagonalizing this matrix gives a conjugation of this group with the standard group .\nSubgroups.\nThe group and related subgroups of can be described algebraically. Partition a matrix \"L\" in as a &lt;a href=\"block%20matrix\"&gt;block matrix&lt;/a&gt;:\nwhere \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\" are \"p\"\u00d7\"p\", \"p\"\u00d7\"q\", \"q\"\u00d7\"p\", and \"q\"\u00d7\"q\" blocks, respectively. It can be shown that the set of matrices in whose upper-left \"p\"\u00d7\"p\" block \"A\" has positive determinant is a subgroup. Or, to put it another way, if\nare in , then\nThe analogous result for the bottom-right \"q\"\u00d7\"q\" block also holds. The subgroup consists of matrices \"L\" such that and are both positive.\nFor all matrices \"L\" in , the determinants of \"A\" and \"D\" have the property that formula_22 and that formula_23 In particular, the subgroup consists of matrices \"L\" such that and have the same sign.\nTopology.\nAssuming both \"p\" and \"q\" are positive, neither of the groups nor are &lt;a href=\"connected%20space\"&gt;connected&lt;/a&gt;, having four and two components respectively.\n is the &lt;a href=\"Klein%20four-group\"&gt;Klein four-group&lt;/a&gt;, with each factor being whether an element preserves or reverses the respective orientations on the \"p\" and \"q\" dimensional subspaces on which the form is definite; note that reversing orientation on only one of these subspaces reverses orientation on the whole space. The special orthogonal group has components }, each of which either preserves both orientations or reverses both orientations, in either case preserving the overall orientation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"identity%20component\"&gt;identity component&lt;/a&gt; of is often denoted and can be identified with the set of elements in that preserve both orientations. This notation is related to the notation for the &lt;a href=\"orthochronous%20Lorentz%20group\"&gt;orthochronous Lorentz group&lt;/a&gt;, where the + refers to preserving the orientation on the first (temporal) dimension.\nThe group is also not &lt;a href=\"compact%20space\"&gt;compact&lt;/a&gt;, but contains the compact subgroups O(\"p\") and O(\"q\") acting on the subspaces on which the form is definite. In fact, is a &lt;a href=\"maximal%20compact%20subgroup\"&gt;maximal compact subgroup&lt;/a&gt; of , while is a maximal compact subgroup of .\nLikewise, is a maximal compact subgroup of .\nThus, the spaces are homotopy equivalent to products of (special) orthogonal groups, from which algebro-topological invariants can be computed. (See &lt;a href=\"Maximal%20compact%20subgroup%23Topology\"&gt;Maximal compact subgroup&lt;/a&gt;.)\nIn particular, the &lt;a href=\"fundamental%20group\"&gt;fundamental group&lt;/a&gt; of is the product of the fundamental groups of the components, , and is given by:\nSplit orthogonal group.\nIn even dimensions, the middle group is known as the split orthogonal group, and is of particular interest, as it occurs as the group of &lt;a href=\"T-duality\"&gt;T-duality&lt;/a&gt; transformations in string theory, for example. It is the &lt;a href=\"split%20Lie%20group\"&gt;split Lie group&lt;/a&gt; corresponding to the complex &lt;a href=\"Lie%20algebra\"&gt;Lie algebra&lt;/a&gt; so2\"n\" (the Lie group of the &lt;a href=\"split%20real%20form\"&gt;split real form&lt;/a&gt; of the Lie algebra); more precisely, the identity component is the split Lie group, as non-identity components cannot be reconstructed from the Lie algebra. In this sense it is opposite to the definite orthogonal group , which is the &lt;a href=\"compact%20real%20form\"&gt;\"compact\" real form&lt;/a&gt; of the complex Lie algebra.\nThe case corresponds to the &lt;a href=\"multiplicative%20group\"&gt;multiplicative group&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"split-complex%20number\"&gt;split-complex number&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn terms of being a &lt;a href=\"group%20of%20Lie%20type\"&gt;group of Lie type&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 i.e., construction of an algebraic group from a Lie algebra \u2013 split orthogonal groups are &lt;a href=\"Chevalley%20group\"&gt;Chevalley group&lt;/a&gt;s, while the non-split orthogonal groups require a slightly more complicated construction, and are &lt;a href=\"Steinberg%20group%20%28Lie%20theory%29\"&gt;Steinberg groups&lt;/a&gt;.\nSplit orthogonal groups are used to construct the &lt;a href=\"generalized%20flag%20variety\"&gt;generalized flag variety&lt;/a&gt; over non-algebraically closed fields."
