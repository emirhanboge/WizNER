    "text": "The Pioneers of the Revolution () was a youth organisation in &lt;a href=\"Burkina%20Faso\"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt;, modelled along the pattern of the &lt;a href=\"pioneer%20movement\"&gt;pioneer movement&lt;/a&gt;s typically operated by &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; parties, such as the contemporary &lt;a href=\"Pioneers%20of%20Enver\"&gt;Pioneers of Enver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mart%C3%AD%20Pioneer%20Organization\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Pioneer Organisation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agostinho%20Neto%20Pioneer%20Organization\"&gt;Agostinho Neto Pioneer Organisation&lt;/a&gt;. The Pioneers of the Revolution organised children of all ages. Much like many other young pioneer movements, such as the &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Lenin%20All-Union%20Pioneer%20Organization\"&gt;Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organisation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Young%20Pioneers%20of%20China\"&gt;Young Pioneers of China&lt;/a&gt;, the most distinct sign of the Pioneers were their red scarves, joined by rudimentary uniforms and &lt;a href=\"Beret%23As%20a%20revolutionary%20symbol\"&gt;yellow berets&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe movement was founded by Captain &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Sankara\"&gt;Thomas Sankara&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Marxism\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pan-Africanism\"&gt;pan-Africanist&lt;/a&gt; revolutionary who came to power in what was then the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Upper%20Volta\"&gt;Republic of Upper Volta&lt;/a&gt; after a popularly-supported coup in 1983. Sankara undertook what he called the \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\" (), a radical transformation of society. Many of the measures taken by Sankara and his Council of Popular Salvation junta were concerned with children \u2013 for example, &lt;a href=\"female%20genital%20mutilation\"&gt;female genital mutilation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"forced%20marriage\"&gt;forced marriage&lt;/a&gt;s were banned, a nationwide literacy campaign was held, and approximately 2.5 million children were vaccinated against &lt;a href=\"meningitis\"&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"yellow%20fever\"&gt;yellow fever&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"measles\"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther entities created by Sankara's government included the &lt;a href=\"Committees%20for%20the%20Defense%20of%20the%20Revolution%20%28Burkina%20Faso%29\"&gt;Committees for the Defense of the Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, which many Pioneers belonged to as well, and the &lt;a href=\"Popular%20Revolutionary%20Tribunal%20%28Burkina%20Faso%29\"&gt;Popular Revolutionary Tribunals&lt;/a&gt;. Much like the Committees and the Tribunals, the Pioneers of the Revolution were abolished after Thomas Sankara was killed in 1987 by a military coup led by his former friend and colleague &lt;a href=\"Blaise%20Compaor%C3%A9\"&gt;Blaise Compaor\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, who would remain in power until his own overthrow in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Burkinab%C3%A9%20uprising\"&gt;2014 Burkinab\u00e9 uprising&lt;/a&gt;. One of the primary opposition groups against Compaor\u00e9's government was the &lt;a href=\"Le%20Balai%20Citoyen\"&gt;Citizens' Broom&lt;/a&gt; (). Its leader, the musician &lt;a href=\"Sams%E2%80%99K%20Le%20Jah\"&gt;Sams\u2019K Le Jah&lt;/a&gt;, stated in a 2014 interview that he received his political education as a teenager in Sankara's pioneer youth movement."
