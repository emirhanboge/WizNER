    "text": "Paper wealth means &lt;a href=\"Wealth%20%28economics%29\"&gt;wealth&lt;/a&gt; as measured by monetary value, as reflected in price of &lt;a href=\"asset\"&gt;asset&lt;/a&gt;s \u2013 how much &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; one's assets could be sold for. Paper wealth is contrasted with real wealth, which refers to one's actual physical assets.\nFor example, if one owns a house and its assessed value increases (relative to the general price level, i.e., assuming no &lt;a href=\"inflation\"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt;) then one's paper wealth has increased \u2013 the asset has increased in value, meaning it could in principle be sold in exchange for a larger quantity of money, but one's real wealth is unchanged \u2013 the real asset is still the same house. It is said that one has \"gotten richer \"on paper\",\" meaning \"as an &lt;a href=\"accounting\"&gt;accounting&lt;/a&gt; matter\": numbers on a &lt;a href=\"balance%20sheet\"&gt;balance sheet&lt;/a&gt; have changed, but the physical world has not.\nThe term \"paper wealth\" is frequently used in popular discussions of wealth, and in some critiques of &lt;a href=\"capitalism\"&gt;capitalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt;, and certain economic theories, but is little-used in &lt;a href=\"mainstream%20economics\"&gt;mainstream economics&lt;/a&gt;, which instead generally identifies wealth with paper wealth. The term \"paper wealth\" has some pejorative connotations, suggesting \"only on paper (but not in reality)\", but can also be used neutrally to mean \"(simply) as an accounting matter\". Related distinctions are sometimes drawn between &lt;a href=\"real%20asset\"&gt;real asset&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"financial%20asset\"&gt;financial asset&lt;/a&gt;s, or between &lt;a href=\"tangible%20asset\"&gt;tangible asset&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"intangible%20asset\"&gt;intangible asset&lt;/a&gt;s, the latter particularly in accounting, as detailed below.\nEvaporation of paper wealth.\nA confusing aspect of paper wealth is that it can increase or decrease across an entire economy, without any changes to the real economy; this is known as \"asset price &lt;a href=\"inflation\"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"deflation\"&gt;deflation&lt;/a&gt;\" (a change in the aggregate (nominal) level of prices without corresponding real change). Thus, paper wealth does not \"come from\" or \"go to\" anywhere \u2013 the prices just go up or down. \"It's a common misunderstanding to ask, 'where did the money go'?\" which is particularly asked in the case of a &lt;a href=\"stock%20market%20crash\"&gt;stock market crash&lt;/a&gt; or in the bursting of a &lt;a href=\"price%20bubble\"&gt;price bubble&lt;/a&gt;. This has more colorfully been described as \"A lot of money goes to money-heaven.\"\nAccounting.\nPaper wealth is fundamentally an &lt;a href=\"accounting\"&gt;accounting&lt;/a&gt; matter \u2013 one's &lt;a href=\"net%20worth\"&gt;net worth&lt;/a&gt; is the accounting value of one's assets minus the accounting value of one's liabilities. There are various accounting methods for different assets and liabilities, and they yield different notions of net worth; some methods are more or less volatile than others. For example, one may value (\"hold\", \"mark\") assets at &lt;a href=\"book%20value\"&gt;book value&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the price for which they were purchased; in this case paper wealth does not change when the potential sale price of an asset changes, but does change if the asset is sold, as the asset is replaced by the sale proceeds. Conversely, one may mark assets at &lt;a href=\"market%20value\"&gt;market value&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"mark%20to%20market\"&gt;mark to market&lt;/a&gt; accounting), in which case paper wealth changes as the market varies.\nIn some cases different measures may differ significantly \u2013 for example, one may purchase a stock for $1, and the market value may increase to $100, so the book value is $1 and the market value is $100. Conversely, one may purchase a house for $100,000, and then the housing market may fall, with the identical house next door selling for $80,000. In both these cases, book value and market value (to the extent that there is a market) differ, and which is more accurate may be debatable \u2013 one may argue that liquidation value (price obtained if sold immediately) would be a &lt;a href=\"distressed%20sale\"&gt;distressed sale&lt;/a&gt; and not reflect the potential value in a more orderly sale.\nEconomic effects.\nPaper wealth is attributed as being a factor in &lt;a href=\"economic%20cycle\"&gt;economic cycle&lt;/a&gt;s; in mainstream economics this is interpreted as the wealth effect, while in some heterodox schools it is interpreted as price bubbles.\nWealth effect.\nThe most commonly discussed effect of paper wealth is the &lt;a href=\"wealth%20effect\"&gt;wealth effect&lt;/a&gt;: as people (households) increase in wealth, they are likely to spend more, while if their wealth decreases, they are likely to spend less. This is termed \"the wealth effect\" (compare &lt;a href=\"income%20effect\"&gt;income effect&lt;/a&gt;), and is generally attributed to psychological feelings of confidence \u2013 one feels rich, so one spends. The significance of the wealth effect is debated; it is generally &lt;a href=\"procyclical\"&gt;procyclical&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that when the economy is doing well, asset prices increase, causing consumers to spend more, which provides further stimulus to the economy and risks causing overheating. Conversely, if the economy is doing poorly, asset prices fall and consumers spend less, leading to a &lt;a href=\"vicious%20cycle\"&gt;vicious cycle&lt;/a&gt; and potentially a &lt;a href=\"Depression%20%28economics%29\"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrice bubbles.\nLess commonly, increases in overall paper wealth are seen as signs of &lt;a href=\"price%20bubble\"&gt;price bubble&lt;/a&gt;s \u2013 unsustainable increases in the level of prices. These are generally attributed to credit bubbles (prices are bid up using borrowed money), and seen as a significant warning sign of a pending economic crisis; they form the central mechanism of &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20business%20cycle%20theory\"&gt;Austrian business cycle theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"debt%20deflation\"&gt;debt deflation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese concerns are not widely shared by mainstream economics \u2013 elevated asset price levels are considered a concern, but a minor one, while private credit levels are not considered macroeconomically significant, as they are simply a question of distribution.\n&lt;a href=\"Austrian%20economics\"&gt;Austrian economics&lt;/a&gt; ascribes price bubbles as due to excess printing of money by central banks, and ultimately inflationary; the resulting bursting of the price bubble and following depression being necessary purging of the previous excesses.\nIn debt deflation (most associated with &lt;a href=\"Post-Keynesian%20economics\"&gt;Post-Keynesian economics&lt;/a&gt;, but with some mainstream interest), price bubbles are particularly associated with excess \"private\" credit growth, especially extension of credit by commercial banks. While the price bubble itself is neutral, people then borrow against these inflated asset prices (as via a &lt;a href=\"home%20equity%20line%20of%20credit\"&gt;home equity line of credit&lt;/a&gt;), which increases the credit bubble, and it is the elevated level of \"debt\" that is the underlying cause of the ensuing depression.\nRelated distinctions.\nAssets can be distinguished as real (physical) assets, notably &lt;a href=\"property%2C%20plant%2C%20and%20equipment\"&gt;property, plant, and equipment&lt;/a&gt; (PP&amp;E \u2013 real estate, buildings, durable equipment) and &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; (consumables), and financial assets (equity and debt in other companies).\nAt the level of a household, real assets are most commonly a home (both the land and the building), personal belongings (notably cars or other vehicles), and some commodities (such as gold) or collectibles (art). Financial assets most commonly include stocks and bonds (both corporate and government). The status of cash is more debatable \u2013 &lt;a href=\"fiat%20money\"&gt;fiat money&lt;/a&gt; is formally a financial asset backed by a government, while a bank deposit is a financial asset backed by a commercial bank, which today is generally backed by a government (via &lt;a href=\"deposit%20insurance\"&gt;deposit insurance&lt;/a&gt; such as the U.S. &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Deposit%20Insurance%20Corporation\"&gt;Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&lt;/a&gt;). As such, the value of cash may inflate away \u2013 it is a form of paper wealth \u2013 but it is generally distinguished from stocks and bonds.\nA related technical issue in economics is the &lt;a href=\"aggregation%20problem\"&gt;aggregation problem&lt;/a&gt;, as debated in the &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20capital%20controversy\"&gt;Cambridge capital controversy&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 to what extent is it permissible and useful to aggregate different measures? Aggregating different physical and financial assets is, in some views, illegitimate or misleading, though the \"market value\" of assets can simply be aggregated by adding. This aggregation is generally accepted practice in economic theory, with disaggregation reserved for accounting or detailed analysis.\nIn accounting, &lt;a href=\"tangible%20asset\"&gt;tangible asset&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"intangible%20asset\"&gt;intangible asset&lt;/a&gt;s are distinguished. In &lt;a href=\"wealth%20management\"&gt;wealth management&lt;/a&gt;, liquid financial assets (roughly corresponding to common understanding of paper wealth, ignoring value of housing) is a key metric.\nOther forms of wealth.\nBeyond real assets and financial assets, other valuable intangible assets, which are popularly referred to as \"wealth\", are formally referred to as forms of \"&lt;a href=\"capital%20%28economics%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;\". At the individual level these are referred to as &lt;a href=\"human%20capital\"&gt;human capital&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"social%20connection\"&gt;social connection&lt;/a&gt;s, while at the social level these are referred to as &lt;a href=\"social%20capital\"&gt;social capital&lt;/a&gt;, and include communities, social norms, and institutions; more traditionally these were referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"civilization\"&gt;civilization&lt;/a&gt;\", but this usage is now considered pejorative. There is also what &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Bourdieu\"&gt;Pierre Bourdieu&lt;/a&gt; calls &lt;a href=\"cultural%20capital\"&gt;cultural capital&lt;/a&gt;, the asset of knowledge and connections that university-educated people have."
