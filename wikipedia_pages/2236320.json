    "text": "Norman Ellard Nixon (born October 11, 1955) is an American former professional &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; player who played for the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Lakers\"&gt;Los Angeles Lakers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Clippers\"&gt;San Diego/Los Angeles Clippers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt; (NBA). He also played with &lt;a href=\"Scavolini%20Pesaro\"&gt;Scavolini Pesaro&lt;/a&gt; in Italy. A 2-time &lt;a href=\"NBA%20All-Star\"&gt;NBA All-Star&lt;/a&gt;, he won two &lt;a href=\"NBA%20championships\"&gt;NBA championships&lt;/a&gt; with the Lakers over the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%2076ers\"&gt;Philadelphia 76ers&lt;/a&gt; at the onset of their &lt;a href=\"Showtime%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Showtime&lt;/a&gt; era in the 1980s.\nEarly life.\nBorn the third of three sons to Mary Jo and Elmer Nixon, in &lt;a href=\"Macon%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Macon, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, his mother contracted &lt;a href=\"myasthenia%20gravis\"&gt;myasthenia gravis&lt;/a&gt; when Norm was a baby, and his parents divorced when he was two years old. The three boys were also raised with the help of his maternal grandmother and great-aunt. He and his two brothers, Ken and Ron, attended the &lt;a href=\"Methodist\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt; church, and Norm became an usher there.\nHigh school.\nHe played basketball and &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; in high school at &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20Magnet%20High%20School\"&gt;Southwest High School&lt;/a&gt; in Macon, Georgia, and was named to all-state in both sports. In football, he played &lt;a href=\"defensive%20back\"&gt;defensive back&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halfback%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;tailback&lt;/a&gt;, and was offered a free-agent tryout by both the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Cowboys\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;. He was senior class president and named as the starting guard on the Georgia All-State team for 1973, after leading Southwest to the 1973 state high school basketball championship under coach &lt;a href=\"Donald%20%26quot%3BDuck%26quot%3B%20Richardson\"&gt;Donald \"Duck\" Richardson&lt;/a&gt;. Nixon also played the trumpet and was on the yearbook staff. He was on the track team, ran the &lt;a href=\"400%20m\"&gt;440 yard dash&lt;/a&gt;, and won a regional title in the &lt;a href=\"high%20jump\"&gt;high jump&lt;/a&gt; at 6 feet, 5 inches.\nCollege.\nHe played four full seasons at &lt;a href=\"Duquesne%20University\"&gt;Duquesne University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, Pennsylvania. While there, he averaged 17.2 points-per-game (PPG), 5.5 assists-per-game (APG), and 4.0 rebounds-per-game (RPG), scoring 1,805 points and adding 577 assists in 104 games for his career with the &lt;a href=\"Duquesne%20Dukes%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Duquesne Dukes&lt;/a&gt;. Nixon was named first-team All-&lt;a href=\"Atlantic%2010%20Conference\"&gt;Eastern Eight Conference&lt;/a&gt;, and left holding the record for career assists.\nOn January 27, 2001, during the halftime of a game against &lt;a href=\"Xavier%20Musketeers%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Xavier University&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;), the Duquesne University Department of Athletics retired the jerseys of five of its all-time greatest players, including Nixon's #10 (also retired were &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Cooper%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Chuck Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sihugo%20Green\"&gt;Sihugo Green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Ricketts\"&gt;Dick Ricketts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Somerset\"&gt;Willie Somerset&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn 2019, Nixon gave his blessing for his retired number 10 to be worn by sophomore point guard Sincere Carry. Carry requested to wear it in order to pay tribute to a friend who wore number 10 in high school, and who died from gun violence that spring.\nNBA career.\nLos Angeles Lakers.\nNixon was the 22nd overall pick in the &lt;a href=\"1977%20NBA%20draft\"&gt;1977 NBA draft&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Lakers\"&gt;Los Angeles Lakers&lt;/a&gt;. He played for the Lakers for six successful seasons and helped the &lt;a href=\"Showtime%20Lakers\"&gt;Showtime Lakers&lt;/a&gt; win NBA championships in &lt;a href=\"1980%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt; (4\u20132) and &lt;a href=\"1982%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;1982&lt;/a&gt; (4\u20132), both against the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%2076ers\"&gt;Philadelphia 76ers&lt;/a&gt;. The same two teams would meet in the &lt;a href=\"1983%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;1983 NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt;, in which Philadelphia &lt;a href=\"sweep%20%28sports%29\"&gt;swept&lt;/a&gt; 4-0. In the 1978 (&lt;a href=\"Seattle%20SuperSonics\"&gt;Seattle SuperSonics&lt;/a&gt;), 1979 (Seattle), and 1981 (&lt;a href=\"Houston%20Rockets\"&gt;Houston Rockets&lt;/a&gt;) playoffs, the Lakers were eliminated by the eventual Western Conference champion.\nHe led the team in scoring in the 1982 playoffs.\nIn game one of the 1983 finals he had a violent collision with &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Toney\"&gt;Andrew Toney&lt;/a&gt; of the 76ers early in the first quarter. As he came off the floor, coach &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Riley\"&gt;Pat Riley&lt;/a&gt; asked Nixon \"You need a blow?\", to which Nixon replied: \"No, a casket\". He would continue to play in games one and two despite a separated shoulder.\nSan Diego/Los Angeles Clippers.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"1983%E2%80%9384%20NBA%20season\"&gt;1983\u201384 season&lt;/a&gt;, Nixon was traded to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Clippers\"&gt;San Diego Clippers&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for the draft rights to guard &lt;a href=\"Byron%20Scott%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Byron Scott&lt;/a&gt;. Lakers general manager &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20West\"&gt;Jerry West&lt;/a&gt; made the deal to free &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Johnson\"&gt;Magic Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, the team's other point guard, from sharing the ball with Nixon. In his first year with the Clippers, Nixon led the league in total assists and made the All-Star team for the second time in the 1984\u201385 season. After the 1985\u201386 season, he spent much of his later career on the injured list, spending more than two full seasons on the injured list before retiring for good at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1988%E2%80%9389%20NBA%20season\"&gt;1988\u201389 season&lt;/a&gt;. During his time with the Clippers, he would never make it to the playoffs again.\nFor the 1978\u201379 season, he tied &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Jordan%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Eddie Jordan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Nets\"&gt;New Jersey Nets&lt;/a&gt; for the NBA lead in steals with 201, and total games (82 regular season + 23 playoffs = 105). The next season (1979\u201380) he led the league in minutes played (3,226), minutes-per-game (39.3), and was third in assists with 642. He also led the league in assists for the 1983\u201384 season with 914, and regular season games played (82).\nHe missed the 1986\u201387 season after stepping into a hole during a softball game in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Park\"&gt;Central Park&lt;/a&gt; on July 23, 1986, and suffered severe damage to the tendon just above his left knee. Nixon ruptured his right Achilles tendon during a pre-season practice on November 4, 1987; the injury would cause him to miss the entire 1987\u201388 season. Before his injuries, he played in 715 of 725 games available in his first nine seasons.\nCareer accomplishments.\nDuring his NBA career, Nixon scored 12,065 points (15.7 points per game) and had 6,386 assists (8.3) in 768 games played. He was also remembered for faking a &lt;a href=\"free%20throw\"&gt;free throw&lt;/a&gt; at the end of a Lakers-&lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20Spurs\"&gt;San Antonio Spurs&lt;/a&gt; game on November 30, 1982, which caused a double lane violation. The referees erroneously ordered a jump ball, instead of requiring Nixon to re-shoot the free throw. The Lakers got the ball and Nixon made a field goal to tie the game, where they prevailed in overtime. The last three seconds of the game were later replayed in April 1983.\nPost-NBA.\nAfter retiring from the NBA in March 1989, Nixon played for &lt;a href=\"Scavolini%20Pesaro\"&gt;Scavolini Pesaro&lt;/a&gt; of the Italian major-league &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; in April and May. In August 1989 Valerio Bianchini (who had coached Pesaro the previous season) head coach of &lt;a href=\"Pallacanestro%20Virtus%20Roma\"&gt;Messaggero Roma&lt;/a&gt; tried to get Nixon to come play for the 1989\u201390 season. He would participate in some of the NBA's &lt;a href=\"NBA%20All-Star%20Legends%20Game\"&gt;Legends Classic&lt;/a&gt; games that took place during All-Star Weekend in the late 80s and early 90s, before a leg injury forced him out of a game. The league would later retire the game due to fear of injuries amongst players.\nHe became a &lt;a href=\"sports%20agent\"&gt;sports agent&lt;/a&gt; (at Premier Management Group Inc. and then later Norm Nixon &amp; Associates) representing such clients as &lt;a href=\"Doug%20Edwards\"&gt;Doug Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samaki%20Walker\"&gt;Samaki Walker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jalen%20Rose\"&gt;Jalen Rose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Taylor\"&gt;Maurice Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, Teddy Dupay, &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Grant%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Gary Grant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Fitch\"&gt;Gerald Fitch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Warrick\"&gt;Peter Warrick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Smith%20%28defensive%20tackle%29\"&gt;Larry Smith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Al%20Wilson\"&gt;Al Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, and entertainers such as &lt;a href=\"LL%20Cool%20J\"&gt;LL Cool J&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"TLC%20%28band%29\"&gt;TLC&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe founded the Debbie Allen Dance Academy (DADA) in &lt;a href=\"Culver%20City%2C%20California\"&gt;Culver City, California&lt;/a&gt; with his wife.\nIn his retirement years, Nixon concentrated on several business ventures, and served one season as &lt;a href=\"radio%20commentator\"&gt;radio commentator&lt;/a&gt; for the Clippers (2004\u201305), as well as doing analyst work for &lt;a href=\"KABC-TV\"&gt;KABC-TV&lt;/a&gt;'s NBA post-game shows during the mid-2000s.\nSubsequently, he was hired by &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Sports%20West\"&gt;Fox Sports West&lt;/a&gt; to take over &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Haley%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Jack Haley&lt;/a&gt;'s position as studio &lt;a href=\"color%20analyst\"&gt;color analyst&lt;/a&gt; for all Lakers home games, working alongside studio host Bill McDonald during pregame, halftime, and postgame coverage.\nPersonal life.\nNixon has been married to actress/producer/director/dancer &lt;a href=\"Debbie%20Allen\"&gt;Debbie Allen&lt;/a&gt; since 1984 and they have three children, actor &lt;a href=\"DeVaughn%20Nixon\"&gt;DeVaughn Nixon&lt;/a&gt; (Allen is his stepmother), dancer &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20Nixon\"&gt;Vivian Nichole Nixon&lt;/a&gt;, and basketball player Norman Ellard Nixon Jr. (&lt;a href=\"Wofford%20College\"&gt;Wofford College&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Southern%20University\"&gt;Southern University&lt;/a&gt;). Nixon's sister-in-law is actress/director/singer &lt;a href=\"Phylicia%20Rashad\"&gt;Phylicia Rashad&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore they were married, both Nixon and Allen appeared in the 1979 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fish%20That%20Saved%20Pittsburgh\"&gt;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;\" (a film that also featured NBA stars &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Erving\"&gt;Julius Erving&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar\"&gt;Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&lt;/a&gt;)."
