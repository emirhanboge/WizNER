    "text": "George Frederick McWilliams (10 November 1865 \u2013 12 February 1907) was an Australian doctor, &lt;a href=\"military%20surgeon\"&gt;military surgeon&lt;/a&gt;, and politician. He served as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australian%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; from 1901 to 1904, representing the &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20district%20of%20North%20Perth\"&gt;seat of North Perth&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nMcWilliams was born near &lt;a href=\"Geelong\"&gt;Geelong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, to Anne (n\u00e9e Toohey) and Wilson McWilliams. He was sent to school in England, but returned to Australia to study at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, graduating with a medical degree (&lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Medicine\"&gt;M.B.&lt;/a&gt;) in 1888. McWilliams left for Western Australia later that year, initially practising medicine in &lt;a href=\"York%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;. He later spent time in the &lt;a href=\"North-West%20Australia\"&gt;North-West&lt;/a&gt;, working for periods as a &lt;a href=\"pearler\"&gt;pearler&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Stockman%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;stockman&lt;/a&gt;, before moving to &lt;a href=\"Perth\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; to establish his own practice. With &lt;a href=\"Mathieson%20Jacoby\"&gt;Mathieson Jacoby&lt;/a&gt;, McWilliams helped to found the state branch of the &lt;a href=\"St%20John%20Ambulance%20Australia\"&gt;St John Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;, and served as the inaugural president.\nMilitary and political service.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Second Boer War&lt;/a&gt;, McWilliams volunteered with the &lt;a href=\"West%20Australian%20Mounted%20Infantry\"&gt;West Australian Mounted Infantry&lt;/a&gt;, serving as the contingent's chief medical officer. He began the war with the rank of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, and was subsequently promoted &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; and then lieutenant-colonel, returning to Australia in late 1900. McWilliams entered parliament at the &lt;a href=\"1901%20North%20Perth%20state%20by-election\"&gt;1901 North Perth by-election&lt;/a&gt;, which had been caused by the death of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Speight\"&gt;Richard Speight&lt;/a&gt; after only a few months in office. In April 1902, McWilliams was selected to represent Australia at the &lt;a href=\"Coronation%20of%20King%20Edward%20VII%20and%20Queen%20Alexandra\"&gt;coronation of Edward VII&lt;/a&gt; in London, as the leader of the contingent from Western Australia. He returned to Australia in October 1902, but did not recontest his seat at the &lt;a href=\"1904%20Western%20Australian%20state%20election\"&gt;1904 state election&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater life.\nAfter leaving parliament, McWilliams was appointed to the board of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Perth%20Hospital\"&gt;Perth Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. Unmarried, he died in Perth in February 1907, aged 41, from complications of &lt;a href=\"gastroenteritis\"&gt;gastroenteritis&lt;/a&gt;. He was buried at &lt;a href=\"Karrakatta%20Cemetery\"&gt;Karrakatta Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; with full military honours, with the service conducted by the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Perth\"&gt;Bishop of Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Riley\"&gt;Charles Riley&lt;/a&gt;."
