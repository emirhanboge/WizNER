    "text": "The Farnham Farm is historic farm at 113 Mount Pleasant Avenue on &lt;a href=\"Prudence%20Island\"&gt;Prudence Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Portsmouth, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe farm was started by the Dennis family after the original farms on Prudence Island were burned and destroyed by the British during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolution\"&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt; around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Battle of Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;. The farm contains several extant structures including a &lt;a href=\"house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; (ca. 1805), &lt;a href=\"barn\"&gt;barn&lt;/a&gt; (ca. 1850), &lt;a href=\"milking\"&gt;milk house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"field%20%28agriculture%29\"&gt;field&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"garden\"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"woodland\"&gt;woodland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orchard\"&gt;orchard&lt;/a&gt;, and stone walls. The Dennis family sold the house to the Farnhams in 1867. The site was added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 2006.\nThe farm is now owned by the Prudence Conservancy, a local preservation organization."
