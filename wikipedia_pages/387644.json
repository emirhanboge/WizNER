A small amount of &lt;a href=\"grain%20alcohol\"&gt;grain alcohol&lt;/a&gt; (traditionally &lt;a href=\"rectified%20spirit\"&gt;rectified spirit&lt;/a&gt;) is added to the dough before cooking; as it evaporates, it prevents the absorption of oil deep into the dough. \"P\u0105czki\" are commonly thought of as fluffy but somewhat collapsed, with a bright stripe around them; these features are seen as evidence that the dough was fried in fresh oil.\nAlthough they look like German &lt;a href=\"Berliner%20%28doughnut%29\"&gt;berliners&lt;/a&gt; (in North America &lt;a href=\"Berliner%20%28doughnut%29%23Names\"&gt;bismarck&lt;/a&gt;s) or &lt;a href=\"jelly%20doughnut\"&gt;jelly doughnut&lt;/a&gt;s, \"p\u0105czki\" are made from especially rich dough containing eggs, fats, sugar, yeast and sometimes milk. They feature a variety of fruit and creme fillings and can be glazed, or covered with granulated or powdered sugar. \"&lt;a href=\"Powid%C5%82a\"&gt;Powid\u0142a&lt;/a&gt;\" (stewed &lt;a href=\"plum\"&gt;plum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jam\"&gt;jam&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Rosa%20canina\"&gt;wild rose&lt;/a&gt; petal jam are traditional fillings, but many others are used as well, including &lt;a href=\"strawberry\"&gt;strawberry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bavarian%20cream\"&gt;Bavarian cream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blueberry\"&gt;blueberry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"custard\"&gt;custard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"raspberry\"&gt;raspberry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;.\n have been known in &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; at least since the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"J%C4%99drzej%20Kitowicz\"&gt;J\u0119drzej Kitowicz&lt;/a&gt; has described that during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20III\"&gt;Augustus III&lt;/a&gt;, under the influence of French cooks who came to Poland, \"p\u0105czki\" dough was improved, so that \"p\u0105czki\" became lighter, spongier, and more resilient.\nEtymology, spelling and pronunciation.\nThe Polish word (plural: ) is a diminutive of the Polish word \"&lt;a href=\"bud\"&gt;bud&lt;/a&gt;\". The latter derives from &lt;a href=\"Proto-Slavic\"&gt;Proto-Slavic&lt;/a&gt; , which may have referred to anything that is round, bulging and about to burst (compare Proto-Slavic \"to swell, burst\"), possibly of ultimately onomatopoeic origin. From Polish the word has been borrowed into several other Slavic languages, where the respective loanwords (, or ) refer to a similar ball-shaped pastry.\nEnglish speakers typically use the plural form of the Polish word in both singular and plural. They pronounce it as (the last being closest to the Polish pronunciation) and often write it as \"paczki\", i.e., without the &lt;a href=\"ogonek\"&gt;ogonek&lt;/a&gt; (hook-shaped diacritic). This should not be confused with the unrelated Polish word , which is the plural form of , meaning \"package\" or \"parcel\".\nP\u0105czki Day.\nIn Poland, are eaten especially on &lt;a href=\"Fat%20Thursday\"&gt;Fat Thursday&lt;/a&gt; (), the last Thursday prior to &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Wednesday\"&gt;Ash Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Lent\"&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt;. The traditional reason for making \"p\u0105czki\" was to use up all the &lt;a href=\"lard\"&gt;lard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, eggs and &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; in the house, because their consumption was forbidden by &lt;a href=\"Fasting%23Christianity\"&gt;Christian fasting practices&lt;/a&gt; during the season of Lent.\nIn North America, particularly the large &lt;a href=\"Polish%20diaspora\"&gt;Polish communities&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, Detroit, and other large cities across the Midwest and Northeast, Paczki Day is celebrated annually by immigrants and locals alike. The date of this observance merges with that of pre-Lenten traditions of other immigrants (\"e.g.\", &lt;a href=\"Pancake%20Day\"&gt;Pancake Day&lt;/a&gt;, \"Mardi Gras\") on &lt;a href=\"Fat%20Tuesday\"&gt;Fat Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. With its sizable Polish population, Chicago celebrates the festival on both Fat Thursday and Fat Tuesday. \"P\u0105czki\" are also often eaten on &lt;a href=\"Casimir%20Pulaski%20Day\"&gt;Casimir Pulaski Day&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleveland\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Grand Rapids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee\"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.Louis\"&gt;St.Louis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Bend%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;South Bend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Louisville%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Windsor%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt;, P\u0105czki Day is celebrated on Fat Tuesday.\nThe P\u0105czki Day celebrations in some areas are even larger than many celebrations for &lt;a href=\"St.%20Patrick%27s%20Day\"&gt;St. Patrick's Day&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Hamtramck%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Hamtramck, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, an enclave of &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, there is an annual P\u0105czki Day (&lt;a href=\"Shrove%20Tuesday\"&gt;Shrove Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;) Parade, which has gained a devoted following. Throughout the &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Detroit\"&gt;Metro Detroit&lt;/a&gt; area, it is so widespread that many bakeries attract lines of customers for \"p\u0105czki\" on P\u0105czki Day.\nIn some areas, P\u0105czki Day is celebrated with \"p\u0105czki\"-eating contests. The contest in &lt;a href=\"Evanston%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Evanston, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, started in 2010, and is held on the weekend before Fat Tuesday, while Hamtramck's contest is held on the holiday.\nUnited States.\nThese pastries have become popular in the United States as a result of &lt;a href=\"Polish%20diaspora\"&gt;Polish immigrants&lt;/a&gt; and marketing by the bakery industry. Sold in bakeries mainly on both &lt;a href=\"Fat%20Tuesday\"&gt;Fat Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fat%20Thursday\"&gt;Fat Thursday&lt;/a&gt; throughout Detroit and Chicago, they are particularly popular in areas where there is a large concentration of Polish immigrants: &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee\"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt; Northcentral and Southeastern &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and Northern &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Indiana\"&gt;Northwest Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Detroit\"&gt;Greater Detroit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Michigan\"&gt;Mid Michigan&lt;/a&gt; areas, &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;, Greater &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, Greater &lt;a href=\"Cleveland\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Northern and Central &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, Central Connecticut, &lt;a href=\"Western%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Western Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. The Polish community in Buffalo has the largest Fat Thursday event outside of Poland, which is run in cooperation with the monthly Polish Happy Hour Buffalo event."
