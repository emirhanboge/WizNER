    "text": "The 2001\u201302 National Division Three North was the second season (fifteenth overall) of the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%202%20North\"&gt;fourth division (north)&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; domestic &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; competition using the name National Division Three North. New teams to the division included &lt;a href=\"West%20Hartlepool%20R.F.C.\"&gt;West Hartlepool&lt;/a&gt; who were relegated from the &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20National%20Division%20Two\"&gt;2000\u201301 National Division Two&lt;/a&gt; while promoted teams included &lt;a href=\"Scunthorpe%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;Scunthorpe&lt;/a&gt; who were champions of &lt;a href=\"National%20League%203%20Midlands\"&gt;Midlands Division 1&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Darlington%20Mowden%20Park%20R.F.C.\"&gt;Darlington Mowden Park&lt;/a&gt; (champions) and &lt;a href=\"Blaydon%20RFC\"&gt;Blaydon&lt;/a&gt; (playoffs) came up from &lt;a href=\"National%20League%203%20North\"&gt;North Division 1&lt;/a&gt;. The league system was 2 points for a win and 1 point for a draw with the promotion system changing for this season with a playoff system being introduced. The champions of both National Division Three North and &lt;a href=\"National%20League%202%20South\"&gt;National Division Three South&lt;/a&gt; would automatically go up but the runners up of these two divisions would meet each other in a one off match (at the home ground of the side with the superior league record) to see who would claim the third and final promotion place to &lt;a href=\"National%20League%201\"&gt;National Division Two&lt;/a&gt; for the following season.\nAfter the havoc caused by the previous seasons &lt;a href=\"2001%20United%20Kingdom%20foot-and-mouth%20outbreak\"&gt;foot-and-mouth&lt;/a&gt; crisis, this year's competition was much more straightforward with all fixtures being fulfilled. &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20Knights\"&gt;Doncaster&lt;/a&gt; were easily the top side in the competition, strolling to the league title with almost a perfect record (they lost just the one game) and gaining promotion to the &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20National%20Division%20Two\"&gt;2002\u201303 National Division Two&lt;/a&gt;. As league runners up, &lt;a href=\"Dudley%20Kingswinford\"&gt;Dudley Kingswinford&lt;/a&gt; had a tough playoff game away against &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20National%20Division%20Three%20South\"&gt;2001\u201302 National Division Three South&lt;/a&gt; runners up &lt;a href=\"Launceston%20RUFC\"&gt;Launceston&lt;/a&gt; who were ultimately too strong for the Midlands side who lost 26 - 0 and had to spend another season in National Division Three North. Unlike 2000-01 the relegation process was much more straightforward expect that four teams would go down instead of the usual two. West Hartlepool were the first team to be relegated, suffering their fourth relegation in a row (the north-west club were actually a &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20English%20Premiership%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Premiership&lt;/a&gt; team at the start of this slide), followed swiftly by &lt;a href=\"Sandal%20RUFC\"&gt;Sandal&lt;/a&gt; as easily the two worst sides in the league. &lt;a href=\"Morley%20R.F.C.\"&gt;Morley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whitchurch%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;Whitchurch&lt;/a&gt; were the other teams to be relegated, being much more competitive but not having quite enough to stay safe. West Hartlepool, Sandal and Morley dropped to North Division 1 while Whitchurch went into Midlands Division 1.\nResults.\nPromotion play-off.\nThe league runners up of National Division Three South and North would meet in a playoff game for promotion to National Division Two. &lt;a href=\"Launceston%20RUFC\"&gt;Launceston&lt;/a&gt; were runners-up in the south and because they had a better league record than north runners-up, &lt;a href=\"Dudley%20Kingswinford\"&gt;Dudley Kingswinford&lt;/a&gt;, they hosted the play-off match.\nSeason records.\nTeam.\n86 - 3 Doncaster at home to Darlington Mowden Park on 13 April 2002\n71 - 0 Dudley Kingswinford away to Sandal on 24 November 2001\n95 - 13 Doncaster at home to West Hartlepool on 24 November 2001\nDoncaster at home to West Hartlepool on 24 November 2001\nDoncaster at home to West Hartlepool on 24 November 2001\nBlaydon at home to New Brighton on 6 October 2001&lt;br&gt;\nScunthorpe at home to Blaydon on 3 November 2001\nN/A (multiple teams)\nPlayer.\n &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Donkin\"&gt;Matt Donkin&lt;/a&gt; for Doncaster at home to Whitchurch on 10 November 2001\n &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Donkin\"&gt;Matt Donkin&lt;/a&gt; for Doncaster at home to Whitchurch on 10 November 2001\n &lt;a href=\"John%20Liley\"&gt;John Liley&lt;/a&gt; for Doncaster at home to West Hartlepool on 24 November 2001\n &lt;a href=\"James%20Lofthouse%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;James Lofthouse&lt;/a&gt; for Blaydon at home to New Brighton on 6 October 2001&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Robinson%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Tim Robinson&lt;/a&gt; for Scunthorpe at home to Blaydon on 3 November 2001\nN/A (multiple players)\nAttendances.\nDoncaster at home to Dudley Kingswinford on 26 January 2002\nSandal at home to Dudley Kingswinford on 24 November 2001 and Whitchurch on 16 February 2002\nDoncaster&lt;br&gt;\nNuneaton"
