    "text": "The Western Australian Party (WAP) was a short-lived &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n political party that operated in 1906. It was intended as a &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; party to protect the rights of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;ns and to oppose the increasingly successful &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28Western%20Australian%20Branch%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, and drew its supporters from the &lt;a href=\"Protectionist%20Party\"&gt;Protectionist Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Anti-Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"John%20Forrest\"&gt;John Forrest&lt;/a&gt;, a minister in &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Deakin\"&gt;Alfred Deakin&lt;/a&gt;'s government, accepted the leadership of the party. Candidates were endorsed for all electorates in the &lt;a href=\"1906%20Australian%20federal%20election\"&gt;1906 federal election&lt;/a&gt;, including Forrest, but by the time of the election enthusiasm for the venture had diffused. The party elected Forrest in &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20Swan\"&gt;Swan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20Hedges%20%28Australian%20politician%29\"&gt;William Hedges&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Division%20of%20Fremantle\"&gt;Fremantle&lt;/a&gt;. In practice they sat as &lt;a href=\"independent%20%28politician%29\"&gt;independents&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Commonwealth Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; when it formed."
