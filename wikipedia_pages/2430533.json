    "text": "Donald Arthur Schollander (born April 30, 1946) is an American former competition swimmer, five-time Olympic champion, and former world record-holder in four events. He won a total of five gold medals and one silver medal at the &lt;a href=\"1964%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1968%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1968 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. With four gold medals, he was the &lt;a href=\"Lists%20of%20Olympic%20medalists%23Medalist%20with%20most%20medals%20by%20Olympiad\"&gt;most successful&lt;/a&gt; athlete at the 1964 Olympics.\nEarly career.\nSchollander was born in &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, and learned competitive swimming from his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Newt%20Perry\"&gt;Newt Perry&lt;/a&gt;, who ran a swimming school in Florida. As a boy, Schollander moved with his family to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Oswego%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Lake Oswego, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;. Although his first sporting passion was &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, he was too small to compete in high school football. Instead, he joined &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Oswego%20High%20School\"&gt;Lake Oswego High School&lt;/a&gt;'s swim team, and in 1960, helped lead the team to an Oregon state swimming championship as a freshman.\nOlympics.\nAs a teenager in 1962, Schollander moved to &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Clara%2C%20California\"&gt;Santa Clara, California&lt;/a&gt; to train under swim coach &lt;a href=\"George%20Haines\"&gt;George Haines&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Clara%20Swim%20Club\"&gt;Santa Clara Swim Club&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later at the age of 18, he won three freestyle events at the &lt;a href=\"Amateur%20Athletic%20Union\"&gt;AAU&lt;/a&gt; national championships. He made the U.S. Olympic team in two individual events and two relays. Months later, he won four gold medals and set three world records at the &lt;a href=\"1964%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1964 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, at the time the most medals won by an American since &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20Owens\"&gt;Jesse Owens&lt;/a&gt; in 1936. His success helped earn him the &lt;a href=\"James%20E.%20Sullivan%20Award\"&gt;James E. Sullivan Award&lt;/a&gt; as the top amateur athlete in the United States, and the AP Athlete of the Year, defeating runner-up &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Unitas\"&gt;Johnny Unitas&lt;/a&gt; by a wide margin. He was also named &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Wide%20World%20of%20Sports%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Wide World of Sports&lt;/a&gt;\" Athlete of the Year.\nSchollander appeared on an episode of \"&lt;a href=\"To%20Tell%20the%20Truth\"&gt;To Tell the Truth&lt;/a&gt;\" immediately after winning his four gold medals.\nCollege and Olympic swimming.\nSchollander attended &lt;a href=\"Yale%20College\"&gt;Yale College&lt;/a&gt; and is a member of &lt;a href=\"Skull%20and%20Bones\"&gt;Skull and Bones&lt;/a&gt;, a secret society, and the &lt;a href=\"Delta%20Kappa%20Epsilon\"&gt;Delta Kappa Epsilon&lt;/a&gt; (Phi chapter) fraternity. He was the captain of &lt;a href=\"Yale%20Bulldogs%20swimming%20and%20diving\"&gt;Yale's swim team&lt;/a&gt;, winning three individual &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Men%27s%20Swimming%20and%20Diving%20Championships\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; championships. At the &lt;a href=\"1968%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1968 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, Schollander won another gold medal in the &lt;a href=\"Swimming%20at%20the%201968%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay&lt;/a&gt;, but finished second in the &lt;a href=\"Swimming%20at%20the%201968%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;200-meter freestyle&lt;/a&gt;, the event that Schollander had considered to be his best. This was the first Olympics in which 200-meter swimming events were part of the competition.\nFollowing the 1968 Olympics, Schollander retired from competitive swimming.\nAfter swimming.\nSchollander was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"International%20Swimming%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;International Swimming Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; at age 19 in 1965. In 1983, he was one of the first group of inductees into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame. He is also a member of &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Oregon Sports Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1971, he published his first book, \"Deep Water\" (with Duke Savage) chronicling his swimming, his teammates and coaches, and the behind-the-scenes politics of international swimming, especially the Olympic Games. He followed this book in 1974 with \"Inside Swimming\" (with Joel H. Cohen).\nSchollander and his wife Cheryl reside in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Oswego%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Lake Oswego, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, where he runs Schollander Development, a real estate development company. His gold medals are on display to the public at a &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20America\"&gt;Bank of America&lt;/a&gt; branch location in downtown Lake Oswego. Schollander has three children, Jeb, Kyle and Katie.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"
