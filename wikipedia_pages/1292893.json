It lies at the western end of Newton near the intersection of &lt;a href=\"interstate%20highway\"&gt;interstate highway&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2090\"&gt;90&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2095%20in%20Massachusetts\"&gt;95&lt;/a&gt;. It is bisected by the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90). Auburndale is surrounded by three other Newton villages (&lt;a href=\"West%20Newton%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;West Newton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Waban%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Waban&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Newton%20Lower%20Falls%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Newton Lower Falls&lt;/a&gt;) as well as the city of &lt;a href=\"Waltham%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Waltham&lt;/a&gt; and the Charles River. Auburndale is the home of Williams and Burr elementary schools, as well as &lt;a href=\"Lasell%20College\"&gt;Lasell College&lt;/a&gt;. Auburndale Square is the location of the &lt;a href=\"Plummer%20Memorial%20Library\"&gt;Plummer Memorial Library&lt;/a&gt;, which is run by the Auburndale Community Library and no longer affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Newton%20Free%20Library\"&gt;Newton Free Library&lt;/a&gt;, the Turtle Lane Playhouse, and many small businesses.\nHistory.\nThe first major settler in the area was William Robinson who built a house in 1678 on what is now Freeman Street. The oldest house in Auburndale stands at 473 Auburn Street and was built in 1730 by William Robinson.\nAuburndale, once billed as \"Auburndale-on-the-Charles\", was the home of &lt;a href=\"Norumbega%20Park\"&gt;Norumbega Park&lt;/a&gt; which closed in 1963. The park included rides, a &lt;a href=\"zoo\"&gt;zoo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"boating\"&gt;boating&lt;/a&gt;. The nationally-famous &lt;a href=\"big%20band\"&gt;big band&lt;/a&gt; venue &lt;a href=\"Norumbega%20Park%23Totem%20Pole%20Ballroom\"&gt;Totem Pole Ballroom&lt;/a&gt; was associated with Norumbega Park and closed in 1964. The area now contains over 80 acres of conservation land as well as access to the Charles River.\nTransportation.\nAuburndale is divided into two parts by the &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Turnpike\"&gt;Massachusetts Turnpike&lt;/a&gt;, which connects it to neighboring villages of Newton and downtown &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;. The village is located adjacent to the intersection of &lt;a href=\"interstate%20highway\"&gt;interstate highway&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2090\"&gt;90&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2095%20in%20Massachusetts\"&gt;95&lt;/a&gt;.\nA number of public transportation options connect Auburndale to neighboring communities. The &lt;a href=\"MBTA%20Green%20Line\"&gt;MBTA Green Line&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Green%20Line%20D%20Branch\"&gt;D Branch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"light%20rail\"&gt;light rail&lt;/a&gt; line serves Auburndale at &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20station\"&gt;Woodland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Riverside%20station%20%28MBTA%29\"&gt;Riverside&lt;/a&gt; stations, the latter being the line's terminus. Both stations have bus connections; Woodland station is served by &lt;a href=\"MWRTA\"&gt;MWRTA&lt;/a&gt; bus routes 1 and 8, while Riverside connects to &lt;a href=\"MBTA\"&gt;MBTA&lt;/a&gt; bus route &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20MBTA%20bus%20routes%23558\"&gt;558&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"MBTA%20Commuter%20Rail\"&gt;MBTA Commuter Rail&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Framingham/Worcester%20Line\"&gt;Framingham/Worcester Line&lt;/a&gt; serves the village at &lt;a href=\"Auburndale%20station%20%28MBTA%29\"&gt;Auburndale station&lt;/a&gt;, adjacent to the Massachusetts Turnpike. &lt;a href=\"MBTA%20bus\"&gt;MBTA bus&lt;/a&gt; routes &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20MBTA%20bus%20routes%23505\"&gt;505&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20MBTA%20bus%20routes%23558\"&gt;558&lt;/a&gt;, which offer express service to downtown &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, both stop at the station.\nNational Register historic sites.\nNineteen places in Auburndale are on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;, as follows\nLocal Historic District.\nEstablished in 2005, the Auburndale Historic District includes approximately 275 properties and encompasses two National Register Districts."
