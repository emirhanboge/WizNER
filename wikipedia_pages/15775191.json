    "text": "\"Makin' Happy\" is a song by American singer &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Waters\"&gt;Crystal Waters&lt;/a&gt;, released in November 10, 1991 as the second &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; from her debut studio &lt;a href=\"album\"&gt;album&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Surprise%20%28Crystal%20Waters%20album%29\"&gt;Surprise&lt;/a&gt;\" (1991). It achieved moderate success in European countries, but spent one week at number-one on the US &lt;a href=\"Dance%20Club%20Songs\"&gt;Dance Club Songs&lt;/a&gt; chart and also reached the top of the Canadian \"&lt;a href=\"RPM%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;RPM&lt;/a&gt;\" Dance/Urban chart. In the United Kingdom, the single peaked at number 18.\nCritical reception.\nAlex Henderson from &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; deemed the song a \"highly addictive and enjoyable &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;neo-disco&lt;/a&gt; fare\". &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Flick\"&gt;Larry Flick&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" described it as \"a frenetic and hypnotic jam\". He noted that it \"maintains a similar &lt;a href=\"deep%20house\"&gt;deep house&lt;/a&gt; vibe [as her first single]. Waters more than proves her songwriting talent here, while her unique feline vocals will test some and delight others.\" Andy Kastanas from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Charlotte%20Observer\"&gt;The Charlotte Observer&lt;/a&gt;\" complimented it as \"a housy tune that's bound to, well, make you happy, what else?\" Machgiel Bakker from \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20%26amp%3B%20Media\"&gt;Music &amp; Media&lt;/a&gt;\" called it \"pop-house\". The magazine also commented, \"Just repeat the words Makin' Happy endlessly and you'll get a good flavour of '&lt;a href=\"Gypsy%20Woman%20%28Crystal%20Waters%20song%29\"&gt;Gypsy Woman&lt;/a&gt;, Part II'.\" &lt;a href=\"James%20Hamilton%20%28DJ%20and%20journalist%29\"&gt;James Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20Week\"&gt;Music Week&lt;/a&gt;\"'s \"RM\" Dance Update wrote that \"the strange nasally pitched girl is less &lt;a href=\"Eartha%20Kitt\"&gt;Eartha Kitt&lt;/a&gt;-like for her follow-up to 'Gypsy Woman', a jauntly trotting repetitive canterer with some \"ooh wee ooh wee ooh\" (and a guy's \"so happy\") instead of all the \"la da dee, la dee da\".\" Jonathan Bernstein from \"&lt;a href=\"Spin%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt;\" described the song as \"ebullient\"."
