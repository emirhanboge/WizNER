    "text": "Pieniny National Park (; abbr. PIENAP) is a &lt;a href=\"national%20park\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;. The park is located in the eastern &lt;a href=\"Pieniny\"&gt;Pieniny Mountains&lt;/a&gt; on the border with &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. It is the smallest national park in Slovakia with an area of 37.49\u00a0km2 (14.48\u00a0mi2) and a buffer zone of 224.44\u00a0km2 (86.66\u00a0mi2). The park is located in the Slovak districts of &lt;a href=\"Ke%C5%BEmarok\"&gt;Ke\u017emarok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Star%C3%A1%20%C4%BDubov%C5%88a\"&gt;Star\u00e1 \u013dubov\u0148a&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Pre%C5%A1ov%20Region\"&gt;Pre\u0161ov Region&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zamagurie\"&gt;Zamagurie&lt;/a&gt; region was already declared as a protected territory in 1932, making it the first protected international nature park in Europe. On the Polish side it was called &lt;a href=\"Pieniny%20National%20Park%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Pieni\u0144ski Park Narodowy&lt;/a&gt;, while the Slovak part of the Pieniny Mountains was a national nature reserve. The National Park itself was founded on 16 January 1967, which makes it the second oldest national park in Slovakia after the &lt;a href=\"Tatra%20National%20Park%2C%20Slovakia\"&gt;Tatra National Park&lt;/a&gt;. By the 1994 act of the Slovak parliament regarding nature and landscape protection, the name of the park was changed to the Pieniny National Park. Its borders were adjusted in 1997.\nLocation.\nThe park is located in north-eastern Slovakia. It covers the eastern &lt;a href=\"Pieniny\"&gt;Pieniny Mountains&lt;/a&gt; on the border with &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. The Pieniny Mountains as a whole, cover an area of more than 100km2. The eastern part of it is situated on the territory of Slovakia, the western half belongs to Poland. The valley of the Dunajec river marks the border between Slovakia and Poland. The Pieniny Mountains are not particularly high, especially in the western part of the range. Though this is somewhat disguised by the extreme dissection of the landscape, especially around the &lt;a href=\"Dunajec%20River%20Gorge\"&gt;Dunajec river gorge&lt;/a&gt;. Along this canyon, the highest point on the Slovak side is the &lt;a href=\"Holica\"&gt;Holica&lt;/a&gt; mountain with 828m. The highest point in the national park is &lt;a href=\"Vysok%C3%A9%20skalky\"&gt;Vysok\u00e9 skalky&lt;/a&gt; at 1050m. Vysok\u00e9 skalky is located in the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Pieniny%20range\"&gt;Lesser Pieniny range&lt;/a&gt;, which forms a boundary ridge between Slovakia and Poland, consisting of several smaller cliffs. In the south and southwest, bordering the Tatra National Park, the protective belt reaches the &lt;a href=\"Popradsk%C3%A1%20kotlina%20basin\"&gt;Popradsk\u00e1 kotlina basin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"%C5%BDdiarska%20br%C3%A1zda%20furrow\"&gt;\u017ddiarska br\u00e1zda furrow&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeology.\nThe geological foundation of the territory of the Pieniny national park is composed of two basic structures. The western part of the Pieniny mountain range consists of a complex chain of rugged mountains through which the Dunajec river cut out a rocky canyon. Near to the spot where the Dunajec river leaves Slovakia, the &lt;a href=\"Lesnicky%20Potok%20brook\"&gt;Lesnicky Potok brook&lt;/a&gt; flows into the gorge from the right side. The &lt;a href=\"Prielom%20Lesnickeho%20potoka%20chasm\"&gt;Prielom Lesnickeho potoka chasm&lt;/a&gt; carved its path through the hard &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; cliffs. It is a gorge, nearly 300m deep squeezed between vertical dark gray limestone cliffs. Above the gorge, the valley of the Lesnicky potok brook is wider and oval-shaped.\nFlora.\nThe Pieniny national park is characterised by the distribution of the vegetation over several altitude vegetation tiers. The nature of the whole Zamagurie region has been heavily changed by humans, e.g. the basins have been deforested. Before the deforestation, the basins and furrows were covered by beech forests, which no longer grow in the Tatras with a small exception of the Belianske Tatry reforestation project. The Pieniny national park is rich in rare varieties of plants, including &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemites&lt;/a&gt; and subspecies, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Chrysanthemum%20zawadzkii\"&gt;Chrysanthemum zawadzkii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taraxacum%20pieninicum\"&gt;Taraxacum pieninicum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Libanotis%20montana%20sibirica\"&gt;Libanotis montana sibirica&lt;/a&gt;.\nFauna.\nThe national park is home to mammals including the &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20brown%20bear\"&gt;brown bear&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20lynx\"&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"chamois\"&gt;chamois&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20otter\"&gt;river otter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"alpine%20marmot\"&gt;alpine marmot&lt;/a&gt;. On the rocky cliffs, &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;s nest on inaccessible spots and several &lt;a href=\"White%20stork\"&gt;storks&lt;/a&gt; nest in the region of the national park.\nTourism.\nThe national park is known for its natural environment, including the &lt;a href=\"Dunajec%20River%20Gorge\"&gt;Dunajec River Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, which is a rafting and hiking location. The park offers traditional folklore and architecture, especially the village of &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cerven%C3%BD%20Kl%C3%A1%C5%A1tor\"&gt;\u010cerven\u00fd Kl\u00e1\u0161tor&lt;/a&gt; with the Museum of National Culture."
