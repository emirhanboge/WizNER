    "text": "Evagoras Paphos () was a &lt;a href=\"Cyprus\"&gt;Cypriot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"soccer\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in the city of &lt;a href=\"Paphos\"&gt;Paphos&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in &lt;a href=\"1961%20in%20football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;, was playing sometimes in First and sometimes in the Second Division. It has adopted its name from &lt;a href=\"Evagoras%20Pallikarides\"&gt;Evagoras Pallikarides&lt;/a&gt;, who was a hero from &lt;a href=\"Paphos%20District\"&gt;Paphos&lt;/a&gt; who was hanged by British Colonists, as he was an &lt;a href=\"EOKA\"&gt;EOKA&lt;/a&gt; guerrilla, fighting for the freedom of Cyprus. The club's badge was a green shield with the figure of &lt;a href=\"Evagoras%20Pallikarides\"&gt;Evagoras Pallikarides&lt;/a&gt;'s as a face in a circle.\nDissolved.\nIn contrast with the other Districts of Cyprus and other major towns, which had permanent teams in First Division, Paphos did not have such a team as the two clubs of the town, Evagoras and &lt;a href=\"APOP%20Paphos\"&gt;APOP Paphos&lt;/a&gt;, could not remain in First Division for many years. For this reason the two clubs were merged to form &lt;a href=\"AEP%20Paphos%20F.C.\"&gt;AEP Paphos F.C.&lt;/a&gt; as the people of Paphos wanted a permanent team in First Division."
