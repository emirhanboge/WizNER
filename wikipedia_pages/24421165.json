    "text": "The Doctor films were developed from the &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20%28novel%20series%29\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"comic%20novel\"&gt;comic novel&lt;/a&gt;s by British physician &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Gordon%20%28English%20author%29\"&gt;Richard Gordon&lt;/a&gt; covering the antics of a group of young doctors. The early films featured &lt;a href=\"Dirk%20Bogarde\"&gt;Dirk Bogarde&lt;/a&gt; in the lead as Doctor Sparrow and &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Sinden\"&gt;Donald Sinden&lt;/a&gt; as Benskin. Later films starred &lt;a href=\"Leslie%20Phillips\"&gt;Leslie Phillips&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe films were directed by &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Thomas\"&gt;Ralph Thomas&lt;/a&gt; and produced by &lt;a href=\"Betty%20Box\"&gt;Betty Box&lt;/a&gt;. The films inspired several spin-off television series.\nThe first film, \"&lt;a href=\"Doctor%20in%20the%20House\"&gt;Doctor in the House&lt;/a&gt;\", was initiated by Betty Box, who picked up a copy of the book at &lt;a href=\"Crewe\"&gt;Crewe&lt;/a&gt; during a long rail journey. She saw its possibility as a film, but Box and Ralph Thomas had a job convincing &lt;a href=\"Rank%20Organisation\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt; executives that people would go to a film about doctors, and that Bogarde, who up to then had played &lt;a href=\"spiv\"&gt;spiv&lt;/a&gt;s and World War Two heroes, had sex appeal and could play light comedy. They got a low budget, and were only allowed to use available Rank contract artists.\nFilms.\nTelevision series.\nA successful &lt;a href=\"television%20series\"&gt;television series&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Doctor%20in%20the%20House%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Doctor in the House (TV)&lt;/a&gt;\", from &lt;a href=\"London%20Weekend%20Television\"&gt;London Weekend Television&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Network\"&gt;Seven Network&lt;/a&gt; (Australia), and the &lt;a href=\"British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; followed."
