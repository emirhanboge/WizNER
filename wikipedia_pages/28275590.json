    "text": "The Rugby League Cup is a &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; trophy that is contested between districts on a challenge basis. The trophy used to be known as the Northern Union Cup.\nIt is the oldest rugby league competition in New Zealand.\nHistory.\nNew Zealand rugby league was born with events such as the &lt;a href=\"1907%E2%80%9308%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20tour%20of%20Australia%20and%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;All Golds&lt;/a&gt; tour of England, and matches in Wellington and Auckland in 1908. John Coffey writes in \"Te Ara\", \"The Auckland Rugby League was formed in July 1909, and North Shore played City as the forerunner to an inter-club competition that started in 1910. By this time, league was also being played in Taranaki, Rotorua, Hawke\u2019s Bay, Nelson, Marlborough and Southland.\"\nThe Cup was made in &lt;a href=\"Bradford\"&gt;Bradford&lt;/a&gt; and donated to &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; for inter-provincial competition by the touring &lt;a href=\"1910%20Great%20Britain%20Lions%20tour%20of%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;1910 Great Britain Lions&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cup was first contested in 1911, when Auckland successfully defended it four times. The Cup was held by Auckland until 1922.\n&lt;a href=\"Auckland%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; are the current holders of the Cup after they defeated &lt;a href=\"Canterbury%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; in a one-off match on 4 June 2012. This was marked as a \"centennial\" match."
