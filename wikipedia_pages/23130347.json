    "text": "The Hotel Continental, built in 1870, is one of the oldest hotels in &lt;a href=\"Tangier\"&gt;Tangier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;. The yellowing pages of the 19th-century guestbook refer to notable residents, Degas, Winston Churchill, and the Beat poets among them, and Bertolucci's Sheltering Sky was partly filmed here. It is located in the Medina area of the city and some of the rooms overlook the harbor."
