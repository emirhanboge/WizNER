His grandfather &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Collins%20%28antiquarian%29\"&gt;Arthur Collins&lt;/a&gt; (1684-1760) was author of \"&lt;a href=\"Collins%27s%20Peerage%20of%20England\"&gt;Collins's Peerage of England&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"A Compendium of Irish Biography\" (1878), states that he was born at the home of his maternal grandparents in &lt;a href=\"County%20Offaly\"&gt;County Offaly&lt;/a&gt;, then known as King's County. Collins went to &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;Exeter Grammar School&lt;/a&gt; before joining the Royal Marines as an &lt;a href=\"Ensign%20%28rank%29\"&gt;ensign&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 14.

On 29 November, and despite a lack of legal training, he was named &lt;a href=\"Judge%20Advocate%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Judge Advocate&lt;/a&gt; for the new colony and chief judge for a military court administering the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;New South Wales Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt;.

Collins filled the three roles of Secretary, Judge Advocate and Lieutenant Governor until he left the colony for England in 1796.\nVictoria and Tasmania.\nCollins also established the first, short-lived settlement in what is now the state of &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sullivan%20Bay%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Sullivan Bay&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Port%20Phillip\"&gt;Port Phillip&lt;/a&gt; in 1803.

Tuckey's report, and Collins' own dissatisfaction with the site chosen, prompted him to write to &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Gidley%20King\"&gt;Governor King&lt;/a&gt;, seeking permission to remove the settlement. When King agreed, Collins decided to move the colony to the &lt;a href=\"Derwent%20River%20%28Tasmania%29\"&gt;Derwent River&lt;/a&gt;, on the island of &lt;a href=\"Van%20Diemen%27s%20Land\"&gt;Van Diemen's Land&lt;/a&gt; (Tasmania).

At Exeter Grammar School, now known as &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20School\"&gt;Exeter School&lt;/a&gt;, where he was educated, there is a &lt;a href=\"House%20system\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; named after him.\nCollins was portrayed by &lt;a href=\"David%20Dawson%20%28actor%29\"&gt;David Dawson&lt;/a&gt; in the 2015 TV series \"&lt;a href=\"Banished%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Banished&lt;/a&gt;\"."
