    "text": "Demos: A Story of English Socialism is a novel by the English author &lt;a href=\"George%20Gissing\"&gt;George Gissing&lt;/a&gt;. It was written between late 1885 and March 1886 and first published in April 1886 by &lt;a href=\"Smith%2C%20Elder%20%26amp%3B%20Co.\"&gt;Smith, Elder &amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt;\nPlot summary.\nIt tells the story of a young, lower-class, &lt;a href=\"Radicalism%20%28historical%29\"&gt;Radical&lt;/a&gt; working-man, Richard Mutimer, who unexpectedly inherits a large fortune. He becomes the leader of a &lt;a href=\"socialist\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; movement and decides to use his &lt;a href=\"inheritance\"&gt;inheritance&lt;/a&gt; to set up a cooperative factory. However, his new wealth and power serve to highlight the defects of character that he brings from his &lt;a href=\"Working%20class\"&gt;working-class&lt;/a&gt; origin and he begins to treat his workers harshly, as well as abandoning the girl of his own station to whom he had been engaged.\nLater in life, Mutimer marries an upper-middle-class woman (who does not love him) and stands for Parliament. However, his downfall begins when his wife, Adela, finds a later version of the &lt;a href=\"Will%20and%20testament\"&gt;will&lt;/a&gt; that had enriched Mutimer. As this could deprive him of his inheritance, he wants to destroy it but Adela will not permit this and the money goes to the rightful heir. The cooperative factory is shut down and the couple move to London, to live in relative poverty.\nMutimer starts another populist movement but is killed by a stone thrown at him by a demonstrator during a meeting at which his followers turn against him."
