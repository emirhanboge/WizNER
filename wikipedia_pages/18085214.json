    "text": "The Angola Debt and Stock Exchange (Bodiva; in &lt;a href=\"portuguese%20language\"&gt;portuguese&lt;/a&gt;: Bolsa de D\u00edvida e Valores de Angola) is a &lt;a href=\"stock%20exchange\"&gt;stock exchange&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Angola\"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;, which is based in &lt;a href=\"Luanda\"&gt;Luanda&lt;/a&gt;. First announced in 2006, the &lt;a href=\"Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; was hoping to open during the first quarter of the 2008 fiscal year, though in August 2008 &lt;a href=\"Aguinaldo%20Jaime\"&gt;Aguinaldo Jaime&lt;/a&gt; said that the launch would be \"a task for the next government... maybe late 2008 or the beginning of 2009\".\nDue in part to the effects of the credit crunch, the earlier intention for the Angola Stock Exchange to open in early 2009 has been further delayed, with current indications that it was scheduled to open in 2010, with the intention to list 10 companies.\nHowever in July 2013, &lt;a href=\"Archer%20Mangueira\"&gt;Archer Mangueira&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the Capital Markets Commission of Angola, said that Angola plans to start the Angola Stock Exchange trading on 2016.\nOn December 19, 2014, the Capital Market in Angola started. BODIVA (Angola Securities and Debt Stock Exchange, in English) received the secondary public debt market, and it is expected to start the corporate debt market by 2015, but the stock market should only be a reality in 2016."
