    "text": "The 1998\u201399 season was the 119th season of competitive &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nRangers played a total of 55 competitive matches during the 1998\u201399 season.

The squad Smith had left behind was past its best so Advocaat, with the financial backing of Murray, set about rebuilding almost the entire squad.\nSuccess quickly followed and Advocaat built a team that gave the club their first domestic treble since the &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20Rangers%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1992\u201393 season&lt;/a&gt;.
