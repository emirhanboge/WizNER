It was established in 1861, as \"The Jewish Congregation of Plattsburgh\", serving Plattsburgh's Jewish population and the itinerant Jewish tradesmen in the region. Plattsburgh's Jewish community was the oldest in the &lt;a href=\"Adirondack%20Mountains\"&gt;Adirondack Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, having been founded in the 1840s by Jewish peddlers from western Vermont and northern New York. These traveling salesmen would come into Plattsburgh for &lt;a href=\"High%20Holy%20Days\"&gt;High Holy Days&lt;/a&gt; and occasional &lt;a href=\"Shabbat\"&gt;Sabbath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20prayer%20services\"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe congregation initially worshipped in temporary locations. They soon had a &lt;a href=\"rabbi\"&gt;rabbi&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1862, they acquired a cemetery. In the ensuing decades, congregations in less well-established nearby Jewish communities, such as the one Burlington, Vermont, would send their dead to Beth Israel's cemetery to be buried. In 1866 the members acquired their first permanent location, the former First Universalist Church on Oak Street.\nPlattsburgh's Jewish community grew after 1880 as a result of Jewish immigration from &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;. By 1907, Plattsburgh's Jewish population was around 125. The congregation, then still located on Oak Street, had 25 member families, and an annual income of $900 (today $). Jacob Lubin served as both &lt;a href=\"rabbi\"&gt;rabbi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hazzan\"&gt;cantor&lt;/a&gt;, and services were held on the Sabbath and the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20holiday\"&gt;Jewish holiday&lt;/a&gt;s. The congregational school met twice a week, and had twelve students and one teacher. The congregation adopted Reform services in 1910, and joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now &lt;a href=\"Union%20for%20Reform%20Judaism\"&gt;Union for Reform Judaism&lt;/a&gt;) in 1913.\nMove to Bowman Street.\nThe current building at One Bowman Street was completed in 1971, and includes a sanctuary, school, social hall, and library. It houses a number of notable works of art, including &lt;a href=\"Marc%20Chagall\"&gt;Marc Chagall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"tapestry\"&gt;tapestry&lt;/a&gt; \"King David\", &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Shahn\"&gt;Ben Shahn&lt;/a&gt;'s silk tapestry \"The Menorah\", and the bronze sculpture \"Remembering the Six Million\" by &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Eliscu\"&gt;Frank Eliscu&lt;/a&gt;, who also designed the &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt;. The building also houses a cut and painted &lt;a href=\"butcher%20paper\"&gt;butcher paper&lt;/a&gt; decoration by Jacob Hochfelder, who was Beth Israel's cantor and spiritual leader in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Designed for the &lt;a href=\"Mizrah\"&gt;east wall of the synagogue sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, it is inscribed with the &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20Bible\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; verse fragment \"I am ever mindful of the Lord's presence\" (), and was created in 1887\u20131889.\nFred V. Davidow, a 1973 graduate of &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20Union%20College-Jewish%20Institute%20of%20Religion\"&gt;Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion&lt;/a&gt;, was Beth Israel's rabbi in the mid-1970s. Yossi Liebowitz was rabbi in the early 1980s. During his tenure, he appeared on a Plattsburgh public-broadcast program called \"The Religion Factor\" with a Presbyterian minister and Catholic priest. He left Beth Israel in 1984.\nMinneapolis-born Eric R. Slaton became rabbi in 1985. Ordained by Hebrew Union College that year, he had served as a student rabbi at Cincinnati's Congregation B'nai Tzedek before joining Temple Beth Israel upon ordination. While at Beth Israel, he was also chaplain of &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Correctional%20Facility\"&gt;Clinton Correctional Facility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plattsburgh%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Plattsburgh Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;. Slaton served as rabbi for three years, before becoming rabbi of Ohavay Zion Synagogue in Lexington, Kentucky.\nCarla Freedman became the congregation's rabbi in 1990. A native of Winnipeg with a master's degree in educational psychology from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Manitoba\"&gt;University of Manitoba&lt;/a&gt;, she was ordained at Hebrew Union College that year, the first Canadian woman to become a rabbi. She was also the first woman ordained at Hebrew Union College to become a grandmother.

That year he left Beth Israel to marry Peter Blackmer of Vermont, and become the associate rabbi of the Ohavi Zedek Synagogue of Burlington, Vermont.\nHeidi Waldmann, also ordained at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, served as rabbi from 2005 to 2008. Andrew Goodman joined as rabbi that year, his first pulpit. He left in June 2010, to pursue studies at &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Commonwealth%20University\"&gt;Virginia Commonwealth University&lt;/a&gt;. He was succeeded by Emma Gottlieb, a May 2010 graduate of Hebrew Union College in New York City.\nAs with her predecessor, Beth Israel was Gottlieb's first pulpit, though she had previously done a two-year internship at a synagogue in Rye, New York. Her father, Daniel Gottlieb, was also a rabbi. Though the younger Rabbi Gottlieb was supposed to start at Beth Israel on July 1, she was delayed in taking up the role because she was a native of Toronto, Canada. Recent regulatory changes made the application process for foreign clergy to work in the United States lengthy, and she wasn't able to enter the country until mid-August. Gottlieb served as rabbi until 2012.\nIn July 2012, Kari Tuling became Beth Israel's spiritual leader.
