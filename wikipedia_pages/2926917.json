Alongside &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Lazarus\"&gt;Glenn Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Beetson\"&gt;Arthur Beetson&lt;/a&gt;, Webcke is considered by many to have been one of the finest post-war front-rowers to play the game.\nAfter retiring in 2006, Webcke became the Sunday\u2013Thursday sports presenter on \"&lt;a href=\"Seven%20News%23Brisbane\"&gt;Seven News&lt;/a&gt;\" in his hometown of Brisbane, a position he holds to this day.\nEarly life.\nWebcke was born in &lt;a href=\"Toowoomba\"&gt;Toowoomba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, of German and Scottish descent. \nOriginally from &lt;a href=\"Leyburn%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Leyburn, Queensland&lt;/a&gt; and having played for Toowoomba, Webcke was scouted by &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Bennett%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Wayne Bennett&lt;/a&gt;, whom he acknowledges as the greatest influence on his career, after seeing him play as a schoolboy in 1993.

Webcke was also awarded the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Sports%20Medal\"&gt;Australian Sports Medal&lt;/a&gt; for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. Following Australia's World Cup victory, Webcke and teammate &lt;a href=\"Gorden%20Tallis\"&gt;Gorden Tallis&lt;/a&gt; wrote an open letter to players appealing for an end to scandalous behaviour amongst footballers which had been tarnishing the sport.\nHaving won the 2000 NRL Premiership, the Broncos travelled to England to play against 2000's &lt;a href=\"Super%20League%20V\"&gt;Super League V&lt;/a&gt; Champions, &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20R.F.C.\"&gt;St. Helens&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2001%20World%20Club%20Challenge\"&gt;2001 World Club Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, with Webcke playing at prop forward in Brisbane's loss.\nWebcke won the Broncos' best player award for the &lt;a href=\"2001%20Brisbane%20Broncos%20season\"&gt;2001 season&lt;/a&gt;.

Webcke was selected in the Australian team to compete in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Rugby%20League%20Tri-Nations\"&gt;2004 Tri-Nations&lt;/a&gt; tournament. In the final against Great Britain he played in the Kangaroos' 44\u20134 victory. With the representative retirement of &lt;a href=\"Gorden%20Tallis\"&gt;Gorden Tallis&lt;/a&gt; and an injury to &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Lockyer\"&gt;Darren Lockyer&lt;/a&gt;, Webcke captained &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20State%20of%20Origin%20team\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2004%20State%20of%20Origin%20series%23Game%20I\"&gt;Game 1 of the 2004 State of Origin series&lt;/a&gt;, which the Maroons lost 9\u20138 in golden point extra time.

He also worked on-screen with &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Johns\"&gt;Matthew Johns&lt;/a&gt; in the first and only season of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Matty%20Johns%20Show\"&gt;The Matty Johns Show&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWebcke's &lt;a href=\"pub\"&gt;pub&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Leyburn%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Leyburn, Queensland&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the Royal Hotel \u2013 is the longest, continuously licensed premises in Queensland.\nWebcke was set to become the first player to give the annual &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Brock%20Lecture\"&gt;Tom Brock Lecture&lt;/a&gt; when he was invited to do so in 2007, but this did not eventuate.\nIn 2007 at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Webcke.\nIn February 2008, Webcke was named in the list of Australia's &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Australian%20rugby%20league%27s%20100%20greatest%20players\"&gt;\"100 Greatest Players\"&lt;/a&gt; (1908\u20132007) which was commissioned by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;NRL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;ARL&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.\nA few months later the Brisbane Broncos appointed Shane Webcke, along with &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Langer\"&gt;Allan Langer&lt;/a&gt;, as full-time assistant coaches to work alongside new head coach &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Henjak\"&gt;Ivan Henjak&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20Broncos%202009\"&gt;2009 season&lt;/a&gt;. However, shortly after the start of the season, Webcke quit his post in the wake of controversy surrounding the release of his new book in which he was openly critical of the Broncos administration not standing down star players &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Boyd\"&gt;Darius Boyd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Thaiday\"&gt;Sam Thaiday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karmichael%20Hunt\"&gt;Karmichael Hunt&lt;/a&gt; when police were investigating sexual assault allegations against them in September 2008.
