    "text": "Susuga Malietoa Laupepa (1841 \u2013 22 August 1898) was the ruler (&lt;a href=\"Malietoa\"&gt;Malietoa&lt;/a&gt;) of &lt;a href=\"Samoa\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt; in the late 19th century.\nTalofa Lava\nPersonal life.\nLaupepa was born in 1841 in &lt;a href=\"Sapapali%27i\"&gt;Sapapali'i&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Savai%27i\"&gt;Savai'i&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samoa\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt;. His father was &lt;a href=\"Malietoa%20Moli\"&gt;Malietoa M\u014dli&lt;/a&gt; and mother was Fa\u2019alaitaua Fuatino Su\u2019apa\u2019ia. He was raised in Malie, received a religious education at Malua Seminary and was well known as a devout &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;. He was the recognized leader of the S\u0101 M\u014dl\u012b which was based primarily in northern &lt;a href=\"Tuamasaga\"&gt;Tuamasaga&lt;/a&gt;. Laupepa cemented ties with &lt;a href=\"Palauli\"&gt;Palauli&lt;/a&gt; (the only significant S\u0101 M\u014dl\u012b support base on Savai\u2018i) through his marriage to Sisavai\u2018i Malupo, a daughter of Niuva\u2018ai of Palauli, &lt;a href=\"Savaii\"&gt;Savaii&lt;/a&gt;. The children of this marriage were two sons named Tanumafili and Siliva\u2018ai, and daughter Fa\u2018amuleuatoivao.\nWhen about 20, he became &lt;a href=\"Malietoa%20Tanumafili%20I\"&gt;Malietoa Tanumafili I&lt;/a&gt; and had other marriages. One he had a daughter by the name of Saitaua who married Leota Laiafi of Solosolo. From his marriage to Fuaolemalo Faumuina Fiame Leitutua Johnson of Lepea and Lefaga he had two daughters; Ta\u2018ase and Faamusami. Faamusami married Mata\u2018afa Fiame Faumuina Mulinu\u2018u I and Ta\u2018ase married Ainu\u2018u Maualaivao Tasi Tupou of Malie and Sapapali\u2018i, Savai\u2018i. and Laupepa later married a Rarotongan woman named Tui Ariki of a chiefly &lt;a href=\"Cook%20Islands\"&gt;Cook Islands&lt;/a&gt; family. In May 1892 laupepa made a visitation to the founding house of Feigla in Western Samoa, Upolu.\nIn June 1894, both Laupepa and his son M\u014dl\u012b II visited with the &lt;a href=\"Latter-day%20Saint\"&gt;Latter-day Saint&lt;/a&gt; missionaries at Lalovi, &lt;a href=\"Mulifanua\"&gt;Mulifanua&lt;/a&gt; with an army regiment of about 1,000 men. The missionaries described Laupepa to be \u201ca very pleasant old gentleman,\u201d about 5\u20199\u201d and 180 pounds who spoke in a \u201cdeep bass voice\u201d. Laupepa underwent the rituals to receive the &lt;a href=\"pe%27a\"&gt;pe'a&lt;/a&gt; traditional tattoo when he was in his forties. Laupepa has many descendants. One of which, a great great grandson, recently graduated from Notre Dame with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering.\nMilitary and political campaigns.\nLaupepa maintained his devout profession of &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; throughout his life, although he became increasingly aggressive as he was thrust into the power struggle against his warlike uncle Talavou. Laupepa did not enjoy universal support from his fellow &lt;a href=\"Samoans\"&gt;Samoans&lt;/a&gt; and his warfare record was dismal; he did, however, win some battles and managed to have himself crowned and subsequently deposed as Joint-King, Deputy-King (under Talavou), and sole King of Samoa in 1881.\nChurchward (84) recorded that the \"Ellice group\", now known as the &lt;a href=\"Tuvalu\"&gt;Tuvalu&lt;/a&gt; islands, were \"formally annexed to &lt;a href=\"Samoa\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt; in the name of &lt;a href=\"Malietoa\"&gt;Malietoa&lt;/a&gt;\" by one of Laupepa's colleagues from Malua Theological College. Before his death on August 22, 1898, Laupepa managed to gain the support of the foreign consuls but he had suffered great losses of prestige and confidence in the eyes of many Samoans after being continually routed in battle and eventually exiled to the &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Islands\"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nLaupepa owned a \"prized Samoan war club\" \u2013 probably a Malietoa family anava &lt;a href=\"heirloom\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 which he gave to the American consul William Churchill. This club was sought by the &lt;a href=\"Bernice%20P.%20Bishop%20Museum\"&gt;Bernice P. Bishop Museum&lt;/a&gt; in 1897 but was not relinquished by Churchill (Sorenson &amp; Theroux 2005).\nLaupepa, the S\u0101 Tupua and foreign governments.\nLaupepa was crowned &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Samoa\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"consul%20%28representative%29\"&gt;consul&lt;/a&gt;s in March 1881. Curiously, the Tumua polities of \u0100tua and A\u2018ana did not accept Laupepa as king (even though they previously supported him against &lt;a href=\"Malietoa%20Talavou%20Tonumaipe%27a\"&gt;Malietoa Talavou Tonumaipe'a&lt;/a&gt;) and they subsequently set up their own government in Leulumoega with Tui\u0101tua Tupua Tamasese Titimaea as their declared King of Samoa. War between Tamasese and Laupepa was declared but the Lackawanna Agreement, signed on July 12, 1881, maintained an uneasy peace. This treaty, mediated by US Navy Captain J.H. Gillis, upheld Laupepa's claim to the throne and named Titimaea as vice-king and &lt;a href=\"Mat%C4%81%E2%80%98afa%20Iosefo\"&gt;Mat\u0101\u2018afa Iosefo&lt;/a&gt; as premier (Keesing 1934:68). King Laupepa protested the increasing German interference in Samoan politics and the Samoan government by petitioning &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt; of Great Britain for protection in 1883 and again (twice) in November 1884. When German consul Weber learned of the petitions he banished Laupepa and his chiefs from &lt;a href=\"Apia\"&gt;Apia&lt;/a&gt;. The German consul Stuebel asserted his dominance over Laupepa's kingship in December 1885 when he ordered the removal of the national &lt;a href=\"flag\"&gt;flag&lt;/a&gt; from Laupepa's base in Apia (Gilson 1970). The German consul placed Tui\u0101tua Tupua Tamasese Titimaea in Laupepa's office and yet another war between the S\u0101 Malietoa and S\u0101 Tupua began in 1887. Districts and families were very often divided or remained neutral since so many leading chiefs were related to both clans.\nLaupepa received a delegation from King &lt;a href=\"Kal%C4%81kaua\"&gt;Kal\u0101kaua&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii\"&gt;Kingdom of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; on January 7, 1887.\nIt was headed by &lt;a href=\"John%20E.%20Bush%20%28politician%29\"&gt;John Edward Bush&lt;/a&gt;, and awarded the honorary decoration Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Star of Oceania the same day. The order had just been created for the heads of state for the proposed Polynesian empire.\nOn February 17, 1887, Laupepa signed the Deed of Federation allying his government to that of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The &lt;a href=\"Native%20Hawaiians\"&gt;Hawaiians&lt;/a&gt; seemed to understand Samoan politics better than the &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;ans since they also sought the signatures of the other tama\u2018\u0101iga but the Germans prevented Mat\u0101\u2018afa and Tupua Tamasese from attesting the document. Laupepa did not appreciate the rowdiness of the Hawaiian delegation, but he hoped that the Polynesian Confederation would provide more than lip service to the Samoan cause. Support from the Hawaiian Kingdom never materialized and Laupepa was ultimately driven into hiding by the German-backed S\u0101 Tupua army in August. Laupepa and some of his leading chiefs avoided capture for several weeks before turning themselves into the German authorities. German Captain Eugen Brandeis coerced Laupepa and others to formally recognize Titimaea as King of Samoa on September 15, 1887 (Gray 78-79) and then Laupepa was exiled on September 17, 1887. \nThe Germans, along with the Ta\u2018imua and &lt;a href=\"Fono%20of%20Faipule\"&gt;Faipule&lt;/a&gt;, declared Tupua Tamasese Titimaea King of Samoa and by August 1888 Tamasese was calling himself both &lt;a href=\"Malietoa\"&gt;Malietoa&lt;/a&gt; and Tafa\u2018if\u0101. He gravely offended the Malietoa families because he did not in fact hold the Malietoa title. He added further insult by amassing Malietoa family fine-mats for himself. Mat\u0101\u2018afa Iosefo, who was the actual and , likewise took offense to Tamasese's audacious claim. With Laupepa in exile the S\u0101 Malietoa was divided once again as to who should rightfully represent the Malietoa families. Some believed Tamasese's claim to the Malietoa was legitimate; others felt that Fa\u2018alataitaua (Talavou's son) was the rightful sa\u2018o; others saw Mat\u0101\u2018afa Iosefo as the legitimate contender. &lt;a href=\"Mata%27afa%20Iosefo\"&gt;Mata'afa Iosefo&lt;/a&gt; [Faife\u2018au] eventually came to the forefront of the Malietoa title struggle and he seems to have obtained the Malietoa title in 1888 or 1889.\nMat\u0101\u2018afa \u2013 who was supported by Fa\u2018alataitaua and the S\u0101 Talavou faction \u2013 managed to reconsolidate the Malietoa allies and led them against Tamasese Titimaea in August 1888. Mat\u0101\u2018afa's people refused to recognize Tamasese as king, especially &lt;a href=\"Manono%20Island\"&gt;Manono&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apolima\"&gt;Apolima&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; gunship SMS Adler attacked Manono and Apolima on September 5, 1888 (Sorenson &amp; Theroux 2005), three days before Mat\u0101\u2018afa Iosefo was declared King of Samoa at Fale\u2018ula. In mid-September, Mat\u0101\u2018afa's forces drove Tamasese's \u0100tua forces from Vaiala to Matafagatele (Vaimauga, Tuamasaga) and won the battle around 10 o\u2019clock at night (Tuvale 45). Malietoa allies from &lt;a href=\"Satupa%27itea\"&gt;Satupa'itea&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Savaii\"&gt;Savaii&lt;/a&gt; island, raided and razed &lt;a href=\"Leulumoega\"&gt;Leulumoega&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href=\"A%27ana\"&gt;A'ana&lt;/a&gt;, on September 20 and Mat\u0101\u2018afa's militias burned villages and &lt;a href=\"plantation\"&gt;plantation&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Satapuala\"&gt;Satapuala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faleasiu\"&gt;Faleasiu&lt;/a&gt;, Fasito'o Uta, and other areas of A\u2018ana within a month of the Leulumoega victory. The people of &lt;a href=\"Atua\"&gt;Atua&lt;/a&gt; experienced the same fate when the newly refurbished Mat\u0101\u2018afa-Malietoa &lt;a href=\"Naval%20fleet\"&gt;fleets&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Manono%20Island\"&gt;Manono&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fa%27asaleleaga\"&gt;Fa'asaleleaga&lt;/a&gt; invaded the coastal villages of Tamasese's allies in Falef\u0101, Faleapuna, &lt;a href=\"Lufilufi\"&gt;Lufilufi&lt;/a&gt; and S\u0101luafata. By February 1889 Mat\u0101\u2018afa's personal army had swelled to about 6,000 warriors.\nMalietoa Laupepa and Mata'afa Iosefo.\nAt first, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; refused to recognize &lt;a href=\"Mata%27afa%20Iosefo\"&gt;Mata'afa Iosefo&lt;/a&gt; as ruler even though the Samoans in general recognized him as their king, and a leader of the it\u016bm\u0101l\u014d. Instead, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; signed the General Act of &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; on June 14, 1889, which declared Laupepa king once again even though he was still in exile (Bevans 118).\nWhen Laupepa returned to Samoa on November 8, 1889, he acknowledged Mat\u0101\u2018afa's right to the title and office which had both been acquired through war and the consent of the people. Peace existed for a time and both men were acknowledged as Malietoa titleholders and national leaders. However Laupepa was soon convinced by his chiefly colleagues to reclaim the kingship which the foreign powers and the Berlin Treaty had allotted him. On December 4, 1889 a \"fono\" (traditional council of Samoan leaders) was held in Lepea, Faleata and Laupepa's supporters (including several Tutuila chiefs) declared him King of Samoa. This declaration led to another division of the S\u0101 Malietoa, this time between Laupepa-S\u0101 M\u014dl\u012b and Mat\u0101\u2018afa-S\u0101 Talavou. \nUnder S\u0101 Talavou sanction, Mat\u0101\u2018afa challenged Laupepa and the S\u0101 M\u014dl\u012b by establishing himself in Malie, the traditional government seat of the &lt;a href=\"Malietoa\"&gt;Malietoa&lt;/a&gt; chiefs, on May 31, 1891. Laupepa and his supporters moved in to occupy Mulinu\u2018u where Laupepa's government had been headquartered. Latter-day Saint missionary journals reveal that support from eastern \u2018&lt;a href=\"Upolu\"&gt;Upolu&lt;/a&gt; (\u0100tua) had rallied behind Mat\u0101\u2018afa (who was by this time the Tui\u0101tua) in Malie and hundreds were arriving to offer their assistance. A similar show of support for Laupepa was witnessed on October 28, 1892 when \u201ca hundred boats\u201d arrived at Mulinu\u2018u bearing military support and provisions. Malietoa Laupepa eventually succeeded in ousting Mat\u0101\u2018afa from Malie toward the end of April 1893. Mat\u0101\u2018afa then \u201cset up house\u201d in &lt;a href=\"Manono%20Island\"&gt;Manono&lt;/a&gt; where he was designated \u201cTama S\u0101\u201d through the title To\u2018o\u0101, not to be confused with the title of the Malietoa (Tamasese 1995b:71).\nThe subsequent War of 1893 was won by Malietoa Laupepa in July of that year and Mat\u0101\u2018afa and other notable leaders were deported to &lt;a href=\"Jaluit\"&gt;Jaluit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Islands\"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt; on July 26 of that year (Keesing 1934:72). Even though Mat\u0101\u2018afa had been deported, the factions that favored him over Laupepa continued in their opposition of King Laupepa. Malietoa Fa\u2018alataitaua assumed full leadership of the S\u0101 Talavou in the absence of his ally, Mat\u0101\u2018afa. Mat\u0101\u2018afa's sanction as Malietoa was \u201cwashed out\u201d through a desanctification ritual and the title then fell into dispute between the S\u0101 Talavou (behind Malietoa Fa\u2018alataitaua) and the S\u0101 Moli (led by Malietoa Laupepa).\n&lt;a href=\"Charles%20Morris%20Woodford\"&gt;Charles Morris Woodford&lt;/a&gt; was Acting British Consul and Deputy Commissioner in Apia from December 1894 to September 1895. His goal was for Samoa to be annexed by Great Britain, although the American Consul, J. A. Mulligan, was supporting &lt;a href=\"Tupua%20Tamasese\"&gt;Tupua Tamasese&lt;/a&gt; Lealofio-a\u2019ana (&lt;a href=\"Tupua%20Tamasese%20Lealofi%20I\"&gt;Tupua Tamasese Lealofi I&lt;/a&gt;). Woodford arranged a reconciliation meeting between Laupepa and Lealofi-o-a\u2019ana in 1895.\nMalietoa Laupepa \u2013 and \u2013 died at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning of August 22, 1898 and was succeeded by his son &lt;a href=\"Malietoa%20Tanumafili%20I\"&gt;Malietoa Tanumafili I&lt;/a&gt;. The situation in Samoa further deteriorated after the death of Laupepa, which lead to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Samoan%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Second Samoan Civil War&lt;/a&gt;."
