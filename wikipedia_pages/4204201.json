    "text": "Rooh Afza (; ; ) (Soul Refresher) is a &lt;a href=\"concentrate\"&gt;concentrate&lt;/a&gt;d &lt;a href=\"Squash%20%28drink%29\"&gt;squash&lt;/a&gt;. It was formulated in 1906 in &lt;a href=\"Ghaziabad%2C%20Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;Ghaziabad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"British%20India\"&gt;British India&lt;/a&gt; by Hakim Hafiz Abdul Majeed, and launched from &lt;a href=\"Old%20Delhi%2C%20India\"&gt;Old Delhi, India&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Rooh Afza is manufactured by the companies founded by him and his sons, &lt;a href=\"Hamdard%20%28Wakf%29%20Laboratories\"&gt;Hamdard Laboratories, India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamdard%20Laboratories%20%28Waqf%29%20Pakistan\"&gt;Hamdard Laboratories (Waqf) Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and Hamdard Laboratories (WAQF), &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1948, the company has been manufacturing the product in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther companies formulate the same un-patented recipe in these countries as well. The specific &lt;a href=\"Unani%20medicine%23Unani%20medicine\"&gt;Unani&lt;/a&gt; recipe of Rooh Afza combines several ingredients popularly believed to be cooling agents, such as rose, which is used as a remedy for &lt;a href=\"Loo%20%28wind%29\"&gt;loo&lt;/a&gt; (the hot summer winds of Northern India and Pakistan and Bangladesh). The drink is commonly associated with the month of &lt;a href=\"Ramadan\"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;, in which it is usually consumed during &lt;a href=\"iftar\"&gt;iftar&lt;/a&gt;. It is sold commercially as a syrup to flavour &lt;a href=\"Sharbat\"&gt;sherbets&lt;/a&gt;, cold milk drinks, ices, and cold desserts such as the popular &lt;a href=\"falooda\"&gt;falooda&lt;/a&gt;. The name \"Rooh Afza\" is sometimes translated as \"refresher of the soul\". It is said that this name was made up by the original formulator of the drink, with possible cultural influences.\nHistory.\nRooh Afza was founded by Hamdard's founder Hakim Hafiz Abdul Majeed. In 1906, he wanted to create a herbal mix that would help Delhi's people stay cool in the summer. He selected herbs and syrups from traditional &lt;a href=\"Unani%20medicine\"&gt;Unani medicine&lt;/a&gt; and created a drink that would help counter heat strokes and prevent water loss in people. An artist, Mirza Noor Ahmad, designed the labels of Rooh Afza in many colours in 1910. Progress in development and refining the original recipe continued all along until the final drink emerged.\nAfter Majeed's death 15 years later, his wife Rabea Begum established a charitable trust in the name of herself and their two sons.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"partition%20of%20India\"&gt;partition of India&lt;/a&gt; in 1947, while the elder son, &lt;a href=\"Hakim%20Abdul%20Hameed\"&gt;Hakim Abdul Hameed&lt;/a&gt;, stayed back in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the younger son, &lt;a href=\"Hakim%20Mohammad%20Said\"&gt;Hakim Mohammad Said&lt;/a&gt;, migrated to &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; on 9 January 1948 and started a separate Hamdard Company from two rooms in the old &lt;a href=\"Arambagh\"&gt;Arambagh&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Karachi\"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hamdard%20Pakistan\"&gt;Hamdard Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; finally became profitable in 1953. Hakim Mohammad Said had opened a branch of Hamdard in the former &lt;a href=\"East%20Pakistan\"&gt;East Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. According to Hakim Mohammad Said's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Sadia%20Rashid\"&gt;Sadia Rashid&lt;/a&gt;, chairperson of &lt;a href=\"Hamdard%20Pakistan\"&gt;Hamdard Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, her father gifted the business to the people of &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; after their independence in 1971.\nIn 2010, chef &lt;a href=\"Nita%20Mehta\"&gt;Nita Mehta&lt;/a&gt; and Indian film actress &lt;a href=\"Juhi%20Chawla\"&gt;Juhi Chawla&lt;/a&gt; were hired for promotional activities by &lt;a href=\"Hamdard%20%28Wakf%29%20Laboratories\"&gt;Hamdard Laboratories&lt;/a&gt; to create new mocktail and dessert recipes for Rooh Afza, their all-season summer drink, which was used in a new marketing campaign.\nIngredients.\nIts original formulation included:\nPreparation.\nRooh Afza syrup is generally served mixed with cold milk and ice; the closest Western equivalent is strawberry milk. Rooh Afza is often prepared as part of &lt;a href=\"Iftar\"&gt;Iftar&lt;/a&gt; (the evening meal for breaking the fast or \"&lt;a href=\"Roza%20%28fasting%29\"&gt;roza&lt;/a&gt;\"), during &lt;a href=\"Ramadan\"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt; (the holy month of fasting for Muslims). The concentrate can also be mixed with water, which is a common preparation in the hot Pakistani summer. When mixed with water, the final drink is a type of &lt;a href=\"sharbat\"&gt;sharbat&lt;/a&gt;. Rooh Afza syrup is often mixed with &lt;a href=\"Kulfi\"&gt;Kulfi&lt;/a&gt; ice cream and &lt;a href=\"vermicelli\"&gt;vermicelli&lt;/a&gt; to make a similar version of the popular Iranian dessert &lt;a href=\"Faloodeh\"&gt;Faloodeh&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuit and fine in Bangladesh.\nOn the complaint of false information, misleading advertisements and publication of false information on the web site, Safe Food Inspector Kamrul Hassan filed a case against Hamdard Laboratories Bangladesh on May 30, 2018. In the case, he mentions that the information published in the advertisement with 'Rooh Afza made with 35 fruit juice' is not correct. On June 12 of the same year, Pure food court judge AFM Maruf Chowdhury fined the company four lakhs taka for publishing misleading advertisements. If unable to pay the fine, then the &lt;a href=\"Hamdard%20%28Wakf%29%20Laboratories\"&gt;Hamdard&lt;/a&gt; chairman and managing director would be punished for three months' imprisonment.\nVariants.\nHamdard Laboratories India has launched two ready to drink variants in India namely RoohAfza Fusion and RoohAfza Milkshake."
