This work, \"PETA's Death Cult,\" was a finalist for the Canadian Online Publishing Awards, in the category of \"Best Online-Only Article or Series of Articles.\"\nAmnesia.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Amnesia%20%28Cooper%20novel%29\"&gt;Amnesia&lt;/a&gt;\" (1992), Cooper's first novel, was nominated for the Books in Canada First Novel Award, and longlisted for the Commonwealth Prize. It chronicles the unraveling of a Toronto family, and the amnesiac girl who ruins one of its children, Izzy Darlow.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Publishers%20Weekly\"&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\" noted that it was \"Published to extravagant praise in Canada (with comparisons to Nabokov, Genet, Calvino and Margaret Atwood).\" \"&lt;a href=\"Kirkus%20Reviews\"&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that \"Amnesia\" was \"more concerned with emotional states than traditional characters, and... reminiscent of, say, Thomas's \"&lt;a href=\"White%20Hotel\"&gt;White Hotel&lt;/a&gt;\".\" &lt;a href=\"Michiko%20Kakutani\"&gt;Michiko Kakutani&lt;/a&gt; in \"The New York Times\" observed: \"Although... (a) self-conscious quality never entirely lifts, one gradually comes to appreciate Mr. Cooper's copious gifts.\" James Polk, in a second \"The New York Times\" review, called \"Amnesia\" \"a dense, absorbing first novel (which) locates prominent features in the landscapes of mind and memory.\" While the \"Chicago Tribune\" hailed the book as \"intricate\", the \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\" dismissed it as \"forgettable\". The \"Boston Globe\" called Cooper \"ambitious\", and noted that he \"takes us on a journey through the dark corridors of the psyche, introducing us to characters who change shape as easily as smoke rings.\"\nDelirium.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Delirium%20%28Cooper%20novel%29\"&gt;Delirium&lt;/a&gt;\" (1998) was the first novel to be serialized on the World Wide Web. It was initially published digitally in 1994, by &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warner\"&gt;Time Warner&lt;/a&gt; Electronic Publishing (TWEP). \"Delirium\" is the second Izzy Darlow novel, and follows the character to Manhattan. Darlow finds himself caught up in the tale of Ariel Price, a legendary architect who has vowed to murder his own biographer. The experiment in architectural structure initiated by Amnesia becomes increasingly complex and monstrous, in line with the projects designed by Price. \"The New York Times\" observed that Cooper \"invents an underground city of the dead and the disenfranchised that suggests the night visions in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crying%20of%20Lot%2049\"&gt;The Crying of Lot 49&lt;/a&gt;\" (by &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Pynchon\"&gt;Thomas Pynchon&lt;/a&gt;).\"\nCooper partnered with &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Eisenman\"&gt;Peter Eisenman&lt;/a&gt; on an installation based on Delirium for the Architecture Triennial in Milan.\nMilrose Munce and the Den of Professional Help.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Milrose%20Munce%20and%20the%20Den%20of%20Professional%20Help%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Milrose Munce and the Den of Professional Help&lt;/a&gt;\" (2007) is a gothic novel for young adults about a pair of flamboyant teenagers who can see and converse with dead students, and their war with the school psychologist who is set on convincing them that they cannot. It is a black comic look at the tactics of guidance counselors and juvenile psychiatrists. The novel became a surprise bestseller when it was accidentally published in &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Kindle\"&gt;Amazon Kindle&lt;/a&gt; format by &lt;a href=\"Doubleday%20%28publisher%29\"&gt;Doubleday&lt;/a&gt;, and was subsequently deemed a \"2008 Book of the Year\" by the United Kingdom's Love Reading 4 Kids. It was on the &lt;a href=\"Financial%20Times\"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; Bestseller List in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, England, after the paper observed: \"Appealing to the misfit in all of us, Milrose Munce is a grand, gigglesome read.\""
