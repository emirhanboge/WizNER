It is the oldest (1903) library in activity in the &lt;a href=\"Kuyavian-Pomeranian%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt;, registered on the &lt;a href=\"Kuyavian-Pomeranian%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt; Heritage List. Since 2002, it bears the name of &lt;a href=\"Witold%20Be%C5%82za\"&gt;Witold Be\u0142za&lt;/a&gt;.\nLibrary.\nCharacteristics.\nThe City Public Library is an important cultural center of &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt; and its region. The institution organizes exhibitions of collections, meetings with authors and numerous events aimed for all ages: in 2014, its various activities gathered more than 31 000 visitors. &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt; library comprises 34 branches, among which 10 for children and 17 for adults. The Library ensemble possessed altogether nearly 1 million volumes, had 50 000 registered readers in 2014.\nThe library has:\nThe library has a valuable antique books, coming from the old Bernardine monastery stock. 10 000 old prints are referenced:\nCurrently collection includes 97 &lt;a href=\"incunable\"&gt;incunable&lt;/a&gt;s (issued before 1500), the following ones being the most precious:\nOther important volumes:\nSince 1936, Bernardine library manuscripts are exhibited in the \"Royal Hall\" and the \"Bernardy\u0144ska ward\" designed by Wiktor Zabielski and Jerzy Rupniewski, with &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt; by Edwarda Kwiatkowski.\nThe facility is run together by the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt; and the local government of &lt;a href=\"Kuyavian-Pomeranian%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBernardine Monastery Library.\nOrigins of the actual institution date back to the creation of the Bernardine library in 1488, which stood at the location of today's &lt;a href=\"Bernardy%C5%84ska%20Street%20in%20Bydgoszcz%23Bernardine%20Church%20of%20Our%20Lady%20Queen%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Church of Our Lady Queen of Peace&lt;/a&gt;. In 1591, Wojciech J\u0119zyk from &lt;a href=\"Sambir\"&gt;Sambir&lt;/a&gt;, then Bernardine guardian, expanded the monastery and built a new brick room for the library.\nThe monastery had organised &lt;a href=\"manuscripts\"&gt;manuscripts&lt;/a&gt; into several disciplines:\nIn addition, the library had books dealing with &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"geography\"&gt;geography&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"astronomy\"&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, medical science, mining and metallurgy. Stocks comprised also historical &lt;a href=\"incunable\"&gt;incunable&lt;/a&gt;s, colorfully decorated by Bernardine brother Aleksi, famous for his adorning of &lt;a href=\"antiphonary\"&gt;antiphonary&lt;/a&gt; books.\nMost of the books come from purchase or donations, some have been brought by monks travelling abroad (Dionizy Szyjka, Jan of &lt;a href=\"Ko%C5%9Bcian\"&gt;Ko\u015bcian&lt;/a&gt;, Melchior D\u0119bi\u0144ski, Wawrzyniec of &lt;a href=\"S%C5%82upca\"&gt;S\u0142upca&lt;/a&gt; and others).\nIn 1574, the &lt;a href=\"Starosta\"&gt;starost of Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt; Jan Ko\u015bcielecki secured the maintenance of the library by assuring a fixed amount of income from a local sawmill. In 1631, Jan Synodoniusz of &lt;a href=\"Pako%C5%9B%C4%87\"&gt;Pako\u015b\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, dying chaplain of the Church of the Holy cross in Bydgoszcz (now gone), bequeathed to the library a sizable collection of books. Likewise the son of Andrzej Rozra\u017cewski, founder of the &lt;a href=\"Poor%20Clares\"&gt;Poor Clares&lt;/a&gt; monastery, gave many &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venetian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"incunable\"&gt;incunable&lt;/a&gt;s. Other well-known donators include: &lt;a href=\"Starosta\"&gt;governor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kcynia\"&gt;Kcynia&lt;/a&gt; Piotr Czarnkowski (ca 1620), &lt;a href=\"Starosta\"&gt;governor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solec%20Kujawski\"&gt;Solec&lt;/a&gt; Antoni Grasi\u0144ski, Bydgoszcz Mayor Wojciech \u0141ochowski or town's woman El\u017cbieta Szychowa.\nThe library, its adjoined &lt;a href=\"scriptorium\"&gt;scriptorium&lt;/a&gt; and the Bernardine academic study of philosophy helped to develop a broader intellectual environment in the city. One of the famous professor of the philosophy was , a bernardine monk who conducted fruitful scholarship work at the local monastery, issuing the first Latin-polish dictionary in 1532.\nSeveral written chronicles written at the beginning of the 17th century by Jan of &lt;a href=\"Ko%C5%9Bcian\"&gt;Ko\u015bcian&lt;/a&gt; describe this fertile scholar period.\nThe library luckily survived the violent times of Polish history, such as the &lt;a href=\"Deluge%20%28history%29\"&gt;Swedish invasion&lt;/a&gt; (1656-1660) or the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Northern%20War\"&gt;Great Northern War&lt;/a&gt; (1700-1721). In 1810, only 2400 volumes were left in stock; at the dissolution of the monastery in 1829, the library, then under the authority of the Head of the city police, was moved to the nearby House of &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Loreto\"&gt;Loreto&lt;/a&gt;'s order and at the demolition of the monastery in 1838, the books have been placed in a compartment behind the main altar of the &lt;a href=\"Bernardy%C5%84ska%20Street%20in%20Bydgoszcz%23Bernardine%20Church%20of%20Our%20Lady%20Queen%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Bernardine Church of Our Lady Queen of Peace&lt;/a&gt;. They have been then transferred to the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Martin%20and%20St.%20Nicholas%20Cathedral%2C%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; where they survived until 1907.\nAt the request of the German authorities, these old volumes have been moved to the stock of &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Bromberg&lt;/a&gt;'s Municipal Library. Shortly before the reintegration of Bydgoszcz to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Polish%20Republic\"&gt;Polish territory&lt;/a&gt; in 1920, ecclesiastical authorities (among whom German priest Jan Filipiak)\nplaced these old volumes to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Trinity%20in%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Church of the Holy Trinity&lt;/a&gt;, for fear of losing them in the hands of the Germans leaving the city.\nMunicipal Library.\nCity library was established on October 1, 1903: located initially in a building on the corner of &lt;a href=\"Bernardy%C5%84ska%20Street%20in%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Bernardy\u0144ska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jagiello%C5%84ska%20street%20in%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Jagiello\u0144ska&lt;/a&gt; streets, it has then been housed from 1904 to 1906 at &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84ska%20Street%2C%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Gda\u0144ska Street&lt;/a&gt; 27 (at the plot where stands today &lt;a href=\"Tenement%20Carl%20Meinhardt%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Tenement Carl Meinhardt&lt;/a&gt;).\nFirst library resources were offered by German private donators: historian &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Ludwig%20Georg%20von%20Raumer\"&gt;Friedrich Ludwig Georg von Raumer&lt;/a&gt;, editor &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Kruse\"&gt;Heinrich Kruse&lt;/a&gt; and German scientific societies affiliated to the \"German Society of Arts and Sciences in Bromberg\", mainly \"Historical Society from Bromberg - &lt;a href=\"Netze%20District\"&gt;Netze District&lt;/a&gt;\" (). The first director of the institution was , who quickly demonstrated a real ability to acquire the funds needed for the maintenance of the library. He had the building expanded, acquiring a wing on Jana Kazimierza street.\nWhen the building and its resources moved to the hands of Polish authorities in April 1920, the institution consisted of 75 000 volumes, of which only 300 were in Polish. Witold Be\u0142za, the new director, (1920-1939 and 1945-1952), began to acquire more Polish books, and in 1939 the stock increased to 150 000 volumes, including:\nDuring &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Poland%20%281918-1939%29\"&gt;interwar period&lt;/a&gt;, the collections of the Municipal Library in Bydgoszcz were regarded as the richest on &lt;a href=\"Kujawy\"&gt;Kujawy&lt;/a&gt; in terms of &lt;a href=\"literature\"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%9345%29\"&gt;occupation&lt;/a&gt; the library has been isolated, forbidden to be consulted. Part of the Polish-language literature was handed over for destruction, even though many books were rescued by Polish citizens working in the warehouse. The historian moved many royal manuscripts away from the Nazi authorities. Some of the books were hidden in the Municipal museum or in basements of elementary schools in the suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt;, so as not to be evacuated by German occupation forces. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, 20% of the library stock have been lost, including 99 &lt;a href=\"incunable\"&gt;incunable&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter 1946, predominant trend was to collect scientific and popular works. The most valuable items, gathered in the Department of Special Collections, were isolated from the central database in 1953. It included among others, 1382 volumes from the Bernardine library, 4 900 items related to &lt;a href=\"cartography\"&gt;cartography&lt;/a&gt;, 972 manuscripts of artists such as &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zef%20Ignacy%20Kraszewski\"&gt;J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Konopnicka\"&gt;Maria Konopnicka&lt;/a&gt;, Julian Krzy\u017canowski, &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Matejko\"&gt;Jan Matejko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henryk%20Sienkiewicz\"&gt;Henryk Sienkiewicz&lt;/a&gt;, Adam Grzyma\u0142a-Siedlecki, &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20Staff\"&gt;Leopold Staff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stanis%C5%82aw%20Wyspia%C5%84ski\"&gt;Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tadeusz%20Boy-%C5%BBele%C5%84ski\"&gt;Tadeusz Boy-\u017bele\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;. In 1957, were incorporated into this Department a collection of medals, plaques, stamps, biographical materials of regional activists, and in 1959 a series of small prints.\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, the municipal library established many branches throughout the city: a new building has been planned to be erected, but the project was finally rejected and transformed to a major overhaul of the existing edifice. In the 1980s, repairs to a damaged building required to change the location of part of the stock.\nIn 1968, the institution has been granted a scientific department, and in 1975, the library was labelled as \"provincial library\". In 2009, a plaque in memory of &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zef%20Wybicki\"&gt;J\u00f3zef Wybicki&lt;/a&gt;, a Polish jurist, political and military activist, has been unveiled on a wall of the Municipal Library, recalling its judicial past.\nDirectors.\nSince its inception, the Municipal Library has been managed by the following directors:\nBuildings.\nThe library complex encompasses two main buildings: one at 24 &lt;a href=\"Old%20Market%20square%2C%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Stary Rynek&lt;/a&gt;, one at 41 &lt;a href=\"D%C5%82uga%20street%20in%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;D\u0142uga street&lt;/a&gt;.\n24 Stary Rynek.\nThe building was constructed between 1774 and 1778 in the &lt;a href=\"Neoclassical%20architecture\"&gt;Neoclassical&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Baroque%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Neo-Baroque&lt;/a&gt; style, as the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Netze%20District\"&gt;Netze District&lt;/a&gt;. From 1781 to 1807, it housed the royal court of &lt;a href=\"West%20Prussia\"&gt;West Prussia&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Warsaw\"&gt;Duchy of Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; (1807-1815), the building contained the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz%20Department\"&gt;Bydgoszcz Department&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, it housed:\nFrom 1908 onward, the edifice has been welcoming the Municipal Library.\nBefore 1908, along Jana Kazimierza street and Zau\u0142ek street stood a one-level building, lower than the main edifice, where was established a printing house. Between 1987 and 1999, this edifice has been thoroughly renovated, restoring the original architectural elements of the fa\u00e7ade.\nThe building displays architecture elements recalling the urban residence style, mixing late &lt;a href=\"Rococo\"&gt;Rococo&lt;/a&gt; and early &lt;a href=\"Neoclassical%20architecture\"&gt;Neoclassical&lt;/a&gt; styles. The front elevation on Stary Rynek boasts 14 &lt;a href=\"pilaster\"&gt;pilaster&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Ionic%20order\"&gt;ionic&lt;/a&gt;-type &lt;a href=\"capital%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;capitals&lt;/a&gt;. The central part of the facade is crowned with a line of vases and &lt;a href=\"baluster\"&gt;balustrade&lt;/a&gt;, mirroring the decoration of the double entrance stairs below. The basement ceiling exhibits &lt;a href=\"Vault%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;vaults&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Groin%20vault\"&gt;cross vault&lt;/a&gt;s. A reconstruction in 1870-1876 dismantled the &lt;a href=\"Attic%20style\"&gt;attic&lt;/a&gt; facade and the monumental staircase covered with a &lt;a href=\"baluster\"&gt;balustrade&lt;/a&gt;.\n41 &lt;a href=\"D%C5%82uga%20street%20in%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;D\u0142uga street&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis building has been erected in 1798 for the needs of the court of &lt;a href=\"West%20Prussia\"&gt;West Prussia&lt;/a&gt;. It became in 1903 property of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Kingdom of Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, and served as the seat of the court hearing till the completion of the edifice on &lt;a href=\"Jagiello%C5%84ska%20street%20in%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Jagiello\u0144ska street&lt;/a&gt; N\u00b03. Later on it housed the Municipal Police (\"Friedrichstra\u00dfe 58\").\nBetween both library buildings runs the narrow Zau\u0142ek street: to unite the architectural ensemble, a covered passage called the \"Bridge of Sighs\" (), has been built in 1920.\nSince the 1920s, the Municipal Library owns the edifice. The outbuilding on the first floor harbours a collection of antique books from the ancient Bernardine monastery library, which stood in the 16th century in &lt;a href=\"Bernardy%C5%84ska%20Street%20in%20Bydgoszcz%23Bernardine%20Church%20of%20Our%20Lady%20Queen%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Bernardy\u0144ska Street&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe building at D\u0142uga N\u00b041 has a \"L\" shape with a side outbuilding and the main entrance on the south elevation. The facades are divided by vertical &lt;a href=\"pilaster\"&gt;pilaster&lt;/a&gt;s and horizontal &lt;a href=\"cornices\"&gt;cornices&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Arch\"&gt;vaulted&lt;/a&gt; cellars are still preserved. The edifice is topped by a &lt;a href=\"Mansard%20roof\"&gt;Mansard roof&lt;/a&gt; with eyelid &lt;a href=\"dormer\"&gt;dormer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFountain.\nThe fountain called \"The Well\" () was unveiled on October 4, 1909. Its creator was sculptor Karol Kowalczewski, and the funder Alfred Kupffender, owner of the pharmacy \"Under the Golden Eagle\" (), located on &lt;a href=\"Old%20Market%20square%2C%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Stary Rynek&lt;/a&gt;. The sculpture commemorated the 100th anniversary of the pharmacy, and stood nearby the shop on the western part of the square: Alfred Kupffender donated it in gratitude towards the municipal authorities which decided to disband the geese-market which used to be held in front of the Golden Eagle pharmacy. \nIn 1940, Nazis authorities began to destroy the Jesuit Church that stood on Stary Rynek, and doing so demolished \"The Well\". Parts of the sculpture, stored in public gardens, survived the occupation period. Franciszek G\u00f3rski, stationmaster at a warehouse, even saved those bronze pieces from being melting away for military purposes.\nAfter the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, a newly cast \"The Well\", has been unveiled on May 1, 1948, moving its original location to stand right before the main elevation of the Municipal Public Library on Stary Rynek.\nThe buildings are registered on the &lt;a href=\"Kuyavian-Pomeranian%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt; Heritage List N\u00b0601414 Reg.A/868, since September 3, 1953."
