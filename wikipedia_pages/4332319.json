    "text": "\"Get Together\" is a song by American singer &lt;a href=\"Madonna\"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt; from her tenth studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Confessions%20on%20a%20Dance%20Floor\"&gt;Confessions on a Dance Floor&lt;/a&gt;\" (2005). Produced by Madonna and &lt;a href=\"Stuart%20Price\"&gt;Stuart Price&lt;/a&gt;, the song was released as the third single from the album by Warner Bros. Records on May 30, 2006. The decision was spurred by the fact that \"Get Together\" was the third most downloaded song from the album. It was also released to coincide with the start of Madonna's &lt;a href=\"Confessions%20Tour\"&gt;Confessions Tour&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20%28band%29\"&gt;Stardust&lt;/a&gt;'s single \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20Sounds%20Better%20with%20You\"&gt;Music Sounds Better with You&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Get Together\" is a &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt;-influenced &lt;a href=\"electropop\"&gt;electropop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trance%20music\"&gt;trance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"techno\"&gt;techno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dance%20music\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt; anthem about the possibility of finding love on the dancefloor.\nContemporary critics appreciated the song, calling it fluid in nature and a wonderful dance track. They complimented Madonna's ability to turn &lt;a href=\"clich%C3%A9\"&gt;clich\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; comments into pop slogans with the song. After its worldwide release, the song became a success on the dance charts of the United States but failed to enter the official &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; chart, only peaked at six on the &lt;a href=\"Bubbling%20Under%20Hot%20100%20Singles\"&gt;Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles&lt;/a&gt; chart. It reached the top ten in countries like Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy and topped the chart in Spain.\nThe accompanying music video incorporated Madonna's performance of the song at London's &lt;a href=\"Koko%20%28venue%29\"&gt;Koko Club&lt;/a&gt;, but it was animated to make it different visually. The video showed Madonna singing the song amongst graphical visuals portraying volcanoes erupting and a cityscape. Madonna performed the song on her Confessions Tour where she was accompanied by two dancers wearing horse reins around their head. In 2007, the song was nominated in the category of &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dance%20Recording\"&gt;Best Dance Recording&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"49th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;49th Annual Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn June 6, 2021, Madonna released the \"Get Together\" EP to all digital and streaming outlets, celebrating the single's fifteenth anniversary.\nBackground.\n\"Get Together\" is written by Madonna, &lt;a href=\"Anders%20Bagge\"&gt;Anders Bagge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peer%20%C3%85str%C3%B6m\"&gt;Peer \u00c5str\u00f6m&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stuart%20Price\"&gt;Stuart Price&lt;/a&gt; with production credits from Madonna and Price. It was inspired by the 1998 dance hit \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20Sounds%20Better%20with%20You\"&gt;Music Sounds Better with You&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20%28band%29\"&gt;Stardust&lt;/a&gt;. Initially the song \"&lt;a href=\"Jump%20%28Madonna%20song%29\"&gt;Jump&lt;/a&gt;\" was to be released as the third single from the album. However, \"Get Together\" was chosen as the third single to coincide with the start of Madonna's 2006 &lt;a href=\"Confessions%20Tour\"&gt;Confessions Tour&lt;/a&gt;. The decision was also spurred by the fact that \"Get Together\" was the third best-selling digital single from the \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" album. Its digital sales stood at 20,000 at that time, whereas digital sales for \"Jump\" were only 9,000. Hence, \"Get Together\" was finally chosen as the third single. The cover artwork for the single features Madonna and her Confessions Tour crew members, including the song's producer Stuart Price. The photo alternatively can also be found on the inlay cover of the \"&lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Going%20to%20Tell%20You%20a%20Secret\"&gt;I'm Going to Tell You a Secret&lt;/a&gt;\" DVD.\nComposition.\n\"Get Together\" is a &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt;-influenced &lt;a href=\"electropop\"&gt;electropop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trance%20music\"&gt;trance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"techno\"&gt;techno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dance%20music\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt; song with \"an irresistible wave of filtered synths and thumping &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; beats\" and incorporates elements from Stardust's \"Music Sounds Better with You\" which also contain samples of &lt;a href=\"Chaka%20Khan\"&gt;Chaka Khan&lt;/a&gt;'s song \"&lt;a href=\"Fate%20%28Chaka%20Khan%20song%29\"&gt;Fate&lt;/a&gt;\". It also refers to Madonna's own songs like \"&lt;a href=\"Holiday%20%28Madonna%20song%29\"&gt;Holiday&lt;/a&gt;\" (1983) and \"&lt;a href=\"Secret%20%28Madonna%20song%29\"&gt;Secret&lt;/a&gt;\" (1994). The song is set in &lt;a href=\"Time%20signature\"&gt;common time&lt;/a&gt; with moderately fast dance &lt;a href=\"Groove%20%28music%29\"&gt;groove&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tempo\"&gt;tempo&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"metronome\"&gt;metronome&lt;/a&gt; of 126 &lt;a href=\"Tempo\"&gt;beats per minute&lt;/a&gt;. It is set in the key of &lt;a href=\"C%20major\"&gt;C major&lt;/a&gt; with Madonna's vocals spanning from A3 to A4. The song follows in the chord progression of Em\u2013F\u2013G\u2013Am throughout. The song is an anthem about the possibility of finding love on the dance floor. It includes an allusion to &lt;a href=\"The%20SOS%20Band\"&gt;The SOS Band&lt;/a&gt;'s 1980 single \"&lt;a href=\"Take%20Your%20Time%20%28Do%20It%20Right%29\"&gt;Take Your Time (Do It Right)&lt;/a&gt;\" in the line \"Baby we can do it, we can do it all right.\" The lyrics comes off as a conversation or an internal dialogue taking place between the listener and the singer.\nCritical reception.\nKeith Caulfield from \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" complimented the song's \"enlightment\" theme. Sal Cinquemani of \"&lt;a href=\"Slant%20Magazine\"&gt;Slant Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" commented that the song turned &lt;a href=\"clich%C3%A9\"&gt;clich\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; comments like \"Love at first sight\" into a pop slogan. &lt;a href=\"David%20Browne%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;David Browne&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\" said that it was fluid in nature and called Madonna as a \"restless soul aching to connect\" in the song. Jason Shawhan from &lt;a href=\"About.com\"&gt;About.com&lt;/a&gt; also complimented the song by describing it as a \"weird and wonderful number.\" Stephen M. Deusner of \"&lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20%28website%29\"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote: \"On 'Get Together', as Price's synths ebb and flow moodily, Madonna asks the eternal question, 'Do you believe in love at first sight?', over a tripping vocal melody.\" Joan Morgan of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Village%20Voice\"&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote: \"The momentum builds rapidly with a seamless transition into the wicked alchemy of 'Get Together', where Madge and Price offer up an irresistible manipulation of rather sweet vocals laced over thumping percussion, seductive synthesizers, and a few subtle soul-claps thrown in for good measure.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Alexis%20Petridis\"&gt;Alexis Petridis&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" admitted that the chorus of the song is triumphant. Chris Norris of \"&lt;a href=\"Blender%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that the song \"evokes both early-'80s dance giants the S.O.S. Band and early-'80s dance giant Madonna.\" In 2007, the song was nominated in the category of &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dance%20Recording\"&gt;Best Dance Recording&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"49th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;49th Annual Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt; but lost to &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Timberlake\"&gt;Justin Timberlake&lt;/a&gt;'s 2006 single \"&lt;a href=\"SexyBack\"&gt;SexyBack&lt;/a&gt;\".\nChart performance.\nIn the United States, the song failed to chart on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;, but reached number six on the &lt;a href=\"Bubbling%20Under%20Hot%20100%20Singles\"&gt;Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles&lt;/a&gt;. Its low chart performance in America was attributed to limited &lt;a href=\"Airplay\"&gt;radio airplay&lt;/a&gt;. A petition was signed by about 3,300 fans at petitiononline.com. Known as the \"End the Madonna U.S. Radio Boycott\", it was addressed to &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Channel%20Communications\"&gt;Clear Channel Communications&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chief%20executive%20officer\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; Mark P. Mays. Fans posted on \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"VH1\"&gt;VH1&lt;/a&gt; websites with messages supporting Madonna, as well as conspiracy theories about why she was not played on radio. It also reached a peak of number 84 on the &lt;a href=\"Pop%20100\"&gt;Pop 100&lt;/a&gt; chart. The song was a success on \"Billboard\"s dance charts, topping the &lt;a href=\"Dance%20Club%20Songs\"&gt;Hot Dance Club Play&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Dance%20Airplay\"&gt;Hot Dance Airplay&lt;/a&gt; charts. It reached a peak of 18 on the &lt;a href=\"European%20Hot%20100%20Singles\"&gt;Eurochart Hot 100 Singles&lt;/a&gt; chart.\nIn Canada, the song debuted and peaked at four on the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;Canadian Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. In Spain, the song debuted at the top of the chart in the issue dated June 25, 2006 and was on the top for one week. In Australia, \"Get Together\" debuted at number 13 which became its final peak. In the United Kingdom, the song debuted at seven in the issue dated July 23, 2006. In mainland Europe, the song reached the top ten of the Finnish and Italian charts and the top 40 in countries like Austria, Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.\nMusic video.\nThe two music videos featured Madonna's live performance at the &lt;a href=\"Koko%20%28venue%29\"&gt;Koko Club&lt;/a&gt; in London on November 15, 2005 during her promotional tour for the album. It was directed by Logan and his production team. The animations and designs were done by artist Nathaniel Howe. Howe was contacted by Logan Studios executive producer Kevin Shapiro and booked as a 3D/2D animator. The conceptualization and work on the video began on May 1, 2006. It was inspired by the work of Italian comic-book artist &lt;a href=\"Milo%20Manara\"&gt;Milo Manara&lt;/a&gt; and retro &lt;a href=\"science%20fiction\"&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt;. Different software like &lt;a href=\"Autodesk%20Maya\"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adobe%20After%20Effects\"&gt;After Effects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RealFlow\"&gt;RealFlow&lt;/a&gt; were used to bring out the different environments in the video. Howe explained further about the creative process in an interview with the Madonna fansite \"Drowned Madonna\". He said,\nDuring the initial phases of the video we focused on testing different looks in 3D to see how the color, environment and cinematography complemented the song. While this was happening the edit of the raw footage was being assembled. As the edit evolved we narrowed down the techniques and look of the worlds. Before we even had picture lock we were dropping in rendered 3D shots; this really allowed us to fine tune both the edit and the effects to work together with the song. As this progressed we regularly sent tests to Warner Bros. and the Madonna camp.\nMadonna was involved with watching the previews of the work done and passed her comments through Shapiro to the development team. After the fluid effects in the video were completed, Logan and Howe fine-tuned and revisited the shots and eliminated any discrepancies while incorporating Madonna's comments.\nThe video starts with showing the world evolving from its &lt;a href=\"Formation%20and%20evolution%20of%20the%20Solar%20System\"&gt;genesis&lt;/a&gt;. Images of volcanoes erupting, &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s and tidal waves flash by to show Madonna and her two backup dancers singing the song while standing on a hill. It continues in this fluid motion up to the intermediate verse when Madonna is shown crawling under the waves and spirals. As the song moves towards the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20%28music%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; again, the scene changes from the mountains to a cityscape. Madonna and her dancers are shown dancing and singing the song on a skyscraper.\nThe video ends with Madonna standing on the building and the camera autofocusing out of the panel.\nIn 2009, an alternate version of the video was included on Madonna's compilation, \"\".\nLive performances.\nIn November 2005, Madonna first performed \"Get Together\" on TV shows such as \"&lt;a href=\"Parkinson%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Parkinson&lt;/a&gt;\" in England and \"&lt;a href=\"Star%20Academy%20%28France%29\"&gt;Star Academy&lt;/a&gt;\" in France, as well as during the &lt;a href=\"Children%20in%20Need%202005\"&gt;Children in Need 2005&lt;/a&gt; telethon in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. Another performances came during concerts at &lt;a href=\"Camden%20Palace%20Theatre\"&gt;Koko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"G-A-Y\"&gt;G-A-Y&lt;/a&gt; nightclub in London, respectively on November 15 and 18, and &lt;a href=\"AgeHa\"&gt;Studio Coast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%2C%20Japan\"&gt;Tokyo, Japan&lt;/a&gt; on December 7.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Confessions%20Tour\"&gt;Confessions Tour&lt;/a&gt;, the song was the second performance of the evening and was part of the \"equine\" segment of the show. Madonna wore a skin-tight, full body black leotard. She opened her hat from the previous performance of \"Future Lovers\", as the background changed from the video of the horses to a red, geometric patterned kaleidoscope shot by &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Klein%20%28photographer%29\"&gt;Steven Klein&lt;/a&gt;. Madonna started singing the song. Two male backup dancers appeared behind her wearing horse reins around their heads to convey the feeling of oppression. The song continued in their choreographed performance, with Madonna sometimes pulling the harness around her dancers as if they were horses. During the intermediate musical interlude, Madonna moved to the front of the stage and lay down on the screen attached to it. As she continued singing the music increased and she started to twirl in the center of the stage. The performance continued with Madonna and her dancers moving to the back of the stage singing the words \"get together\" repeatedly. It ended with the music of the next song \"&lt;a href=\"Like%20a%20Virgin%20%28song%29\"&gt;Like a Virgin&lt;/a&gt;\" starting.\nEd Gonzalez of \"Slant Magazine\", while reviewing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Confessions%20Tour%20%28album%29\"&gt;The Confessions Tour&lt;/a&gt;\" video album, commented that, \"A great song like 'Get Together' is splendidly sung (whoever tweaks the levels on her mic is a genius), but its celebratory, keep-it-together message is compromised by the contradictory feelings of bondage (oppression) conveyed by having two backup dancers equipped with reins around their heads.\" In the live video album release, \"Get Together\" was excluded from the CD package but was included in the track listing of the DVD."
