    "text": "Oakland Plantation, situated on a bluff overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Fear%20River\"&gt;Cape Fear River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Carvers%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Carvers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bladen%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Bladen County, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, was built over 200 years ago by General Thomas Brown, an &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;American Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt; patriot. It is one of a few &lt;a href=\"Plantation%20house%20in%20the%20Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;s of its period in &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; still being used today.\nListed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;, Oakland depicts the architecture and skill of the artisans of that period. Bricks laid in &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20bond\"&gt;Flemish bond&lt;/a&gt; were brought from England on sailing ships as &lt;a href=\"Sailing%20ballast\"&gt;ballast&lt;/a&gt;, transported up river, and unloaded by hand.\nIt was added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1972."
