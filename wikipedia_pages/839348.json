    "text": "Puerto Montt (&lt;a href=\"Mapuche\"&gt;Mapuche&lt;/a&gt;: Meli Pulli) or (&lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;: Port Montt) is a port &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Chile\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20Chile\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, located at the northern end of the &lt;a href=\"Reloncav%C3%AD%20Sound\"&gt;Reloncav\u00ed Sound&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Llanquihue%20Province\"&gt;Llanquihue Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Lagos%20Region\"&gt;Los Lagos Region&lt;/a&gt;, 1,055\u00a0km to the south of the capital, &lt;a href=\"Santiago%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;. The commune spans an area of and has a population of 245,902 in 2017. It is bounded by the communes of &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Varas\"&gt;Puerto Varas&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Cocham%C3%B3\"&gt;Cocham\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; to the east and southeast, &lt;a href=\"Calbuco\"&gt;Calbuco&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest and &lt;a href=\"Maull%C3%ADn\"&gt;Maull\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Muermos\"&gt;Los Muermos&lt;/a&gt; to the west.\nFounded as late as 1853 during the &lt;a href=\"German%20colonization%20of%20Valdivia%2C%20Osorno%20and%20Llanquihue\"&gt;German colonization of southern Chile&lt;/a&gt;, Puerto Montt soon outgrew older neighboring cities through its strategic position at the southern end of the &lt;a href=\"Chilean%20Central%20Valley\"&gt;Chilean Central Valley&lt;/a&gt; being a gateway city into the &lt;a href=\"Chilo%C3%A9%20Archipelago\"&gt;Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Llanquihue%20Lake\"&gt;Llanquihue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nahuel%20Huapi%20Lake\"&gt;Nahuel Huapi&lt;/a&gt; lakes and &lt;a href=\"Zona%20Austral\"&gt;Western Patagonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nPuerto Montt has gained renown and grown significantly through the rise of Chile to become the second largest salmon producer of the world during the 1990s and 2000s. However, the &lt;a href=\"Aquaculture%20in%20Chile\"&gt;Chilean salmon aquaculture crisis&lt;/a&gt; of the late 2000s resulted in severe &lt;a href=\"unemployment\"&gt;unemployment&lt;/a&gt; and exposed weaknesses in the local economy. The city's cultural endowment mixes elements of &lt;a href=\"Chilo%C3%A9%20Archipelago\"&gt;Chilo\u00e9 culture&lt;/a&gt; with a German heritage, although the city has attracted a significant number of newcomers from all over Chile in the last 30 years in search of employment opportunities.\nHistory.\nOriginally, the site was covered by thick forest and was called \"Melipulli\" (which means \"four hills\" in &lt;a href=\"Mapudungun\"&gt;Mapudungun&lt;/a&gt;). It was selected as an entrance to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Llanquihue\"&gt;Lake Llanquihue&lt;/a&gt; when its proximity to the open sea was discovered. The expedition was entrusted to &lt;a href=\"Bernhard%20Eunom%20Philippi\"&gt;Bernardo Philippi&lt;/a&gt;, a German naturalist and cartographer, but after his death in 1851, Vicente Perez Rosales took over his duties, and by the end of September started to chop trees at Reloncav\u00ed sound using local woodsman coming from Huar, Maillen, Huelmo and Calbuco Mainly. By December, after the forest was cut down, the area was burned to clear the land in anticipation of completing the settlement plan. The city itself was founded on February 12, 1853, after government-sponsored &lt;a href=\"German%20colonization%20of%20Valdivia%2C%20Osorno%20and%20Llanquihue\"&gt;immigration from Germany&lt;/a&gt; that began in 1848 populated the region and integrated it politically to the rest of the country. It was named after &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Montt\"&gt;Manuel Montt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Chile\"&gt;President of Chile&lt;/a&gt; between 1851 and 1861, who set in motion the German immigration.\nIn 1912 the city was connected by train to Santiago, making it an important point of entry into Chilean Patagonia and augmenting its commercial development. By 1950 it had a population of 27,500, and the city was rapidly urbanizing. However, the &lt;a href=\"1960%20Valdivia%20earthquake\"&gt;1960 Valdivia earthquake&lt;/a&gt; destroyed much of Puerto Montt, collapsing the port and the train station along with many building and houses. Eventually the city recovered, becoming once again an important urban centre as well as a port of national interest.\n1969 violence.\nAt the start of March 1969, approximately 90 landless persons received advice from &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Party%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Socialist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Chile\"&gt;member of parliament&lt;/a&gt; Luis Espinoza due to the local authority never granting them any land they needed to build homes. On March 4, 1969, they settled on farmland belonging to an absentee landlord. Having been denied titles by the local authorities, these families simply moved onto the empty, unoccupied land. They did so seeking squatters' rights, and without making any payment of rent. Some four or five days later, the local &lt;a href=\"Carabineros%20de%20Chile\"&gt;Police Chief&lt;/a&gt; Rolando Rodr\u00edguez Marb\u00e1n reassured the squatters that they would not be disturbed and could proceed with their home construction. However, a change of plans by the ministry of the interior quickly led to new orders.\nAt midnight on March 9, Luis Espinoza was charged with breaking the law, arrested, and moved to the city of &lt;a href=\"Valdivia%20%28city%29\"&gt;Valdivia&lt;/a&gt;. Following direct orders from Interior Minister &lt;a href=\"Edmundo%20P%C3%A9rez%20Zujovic\"&gt;Edmundo P\u00e9rez Zujovic&lt;/a&gt;, 250 armed policemen launched an assault on the squatting families that dawn. Eight of the landless persons were shot dead and two, a 9-month child and an adult, died afterwards. All of the newly built homes were burned to the ground. The massacre is poignantly memorialized by singer-songwriter &lt;a href=\"V%C3%ADctor%20Jara\"&gt;V\u00edctor Jara&lt;/a&gt; in his song &lt;a href=\"Pongo%20En%20Tus%20Manos%20Abiertas%20%28album%29%23Preguntas%20por%20Puerto%20Montt\"&gt;Preguntas por Puerto Montt&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe massacre of Puerto Montt and the public outcry that followed were major factors contributing to the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20Frei%20Montalva\"&gt;Eduardo Frei&lt;/a&gt;'s party in the &lt;a href=\"Chilean%20presidential%20election%2C%201970\"&gt;Chilean presidential election of 1970&lt;/a&gt; which was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Salvador%20Allende\"&gt;Salvador Allende&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Popular%20Unity%20%28Chile%29\"&gt;Unidad Popular&lt;/a&gt;.\nLate 20th century.\nBy 1979 Puerto Montt was nominated and later become the Capital of Los Lagos Region, thereby becoming the principal administrative, political and commercial centre of Southern Chile.\nDemographics.\nAccording to 2017 &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt;, Puerto Montt has 245,902 inhabitants (121,019 men and 124,883 women) which 25,759 live in &lt;a href=\"rural%20area\"&gt;rural area&lt;/a&gt;s and 220,143 in &lt;a href=\"urban%20area\"&gt;urban area&lt;/a&gt;s. Of 218,858 inhabitants from 2012 census the population grew 12.36% (27,044 people).\nFrom overall population, 52,483 belong to &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20people\"&gt;indigenous people&lt;/a&gt; with it being 50,247 &lt;a href=\"Mapuche\"&gt;Mapuche&lt;/a&gt;, 314 &lt;a href=\"Aymara%20people\"&gt;Aymara people&lt;/a&gt;, 73 &lt;a href=\"Rapa%20Nui%20people\"&gt;Rapa Nui people&lt;/a&gt;, 19 &lt;a href=\"Atacama%20people\"&gt;Lican Antai&lt;/a&gt;, 84 &lt;a href=\"Quechua%20people\"&gt;Quechua people&lt;/a&gt;, 27 &lt;a href=\"Qulla\"&gt;Colla&lt;/a&gt;, 136 &lt;a href=\"Diaguita\"&gt;Diaguita&lt;/a&gt;, 114 &lt;a href=\"Alacalufe\"&gt;Kaw\u00e9sqar&lt;/a&gt;, 38 &lt;a href=\"Yaghan%20people\"&gt;Yahgan&lt;/a&gt;, 175 other and 1,256 declared but not belong to current classification or didn't respond to which one.\nAbout 1.46% (3,595 people) are immigrant belonging to &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; 199, &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; 596, &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; 269, &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; 40, &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; 1,527, &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt; 44, &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; 194, &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt; 157, &lt;a href=\"Central%20America\"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; 153, &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; 52, &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; 242, &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; 83, &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; 16, &lt;a href=\"Oceania\"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt; 6 and No declared 17.\nClimate.\nPuerto Montt has a wet &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20climate\"&gt;oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt;: \"Cfb\") with heavy rainfall throughout the year but a drying trend in the summer. Although temperatures are consistently below , frosts are very rare and occur only a couple of times per month in the winter. For the &lt;a href=\"41st%20parallel%20south\"&gt;41st parallel south&lt;/a&gt;, closer to the &lt;a href=\"equator\"&gt;equator&lt;/a&gt; than to the &lt;a href=\"south%20pole\"&gt;south pole&lt;/a&gt;, Puerto Montt is much cooler than areas further inland in terms of summer temperatures, due to cool ocean currents nearby. This is compounded by the lack of a sizeable landmass on those parallels in the southern hemisphere. That means that Puerto Montt has much cooler summers than areas at similar distances from the equator in the northern hemisphere.\nEconomy.\nPuerto Montt is the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Lagos%20Region\"&gt;Los Lagos Region&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Llanquihue%20Province\"&gt;Llanquihue Province&lt;/a&gt;, and the main sea port at the lower end of Chile's western continental land. The city is the principal commercial, services, and financial hub of the Chilean &lt;a href=\"Patagonia%23Chilean%20Patagonia\"&gt;Northern Patagonia&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Zona%20Austral\"&gt;Zona Austral&lt;/a&gt;. As the geographic region's main port, Puerto Montt is often considered the 'capital' of Chilean Patagonia.\nPuerto Montt is also the gateway to the &lt;a href=\"Chilo%C3%A9%20Archipelago\"&gt;Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chilo%C3%A9%20Island\"&gt;Chilo\u00e9 Island&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Chacao%20Channel\"&gt;Chacao Channel&lt;/a&gt;, and the many other smaller islands in Chile's inland &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Chilo%C3%A9\"&gt;Sea of Chilo\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city's economy is now based upon agriculture, cattle, and &lt;a href=\"forestry\"&gt;forestry&lt;/a&gt; on the surrounding islands, and fishing and &lt;a href=\"Aquaculture%20of%20salmon\"&gt;salmon aquaculture&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fjords%20and%20channels%20of%20Chile\"&gt;fjords&lt;/a&gt; and nearby Pacific Ocean.\nThe city is configured as the hub of one of the largest &lt;a href=\"Aquaculture%20of%20salmon\"&gt;salmon aquaculture&lt;/a&gt; industries in the world. Hatcheries, fisheries and packing plants are mostly located south of Puerto Montt. Fresh salmon is flown daily to world markets and frozen salmon is shipped by ocean to all destinations. The tremendous growth of the region, mainly due to the salmon industry, but also due to rapid expansion of forestry, cattle, and tourism, has proven the massive economic potential of Puerto Montt and its surrounding area.\n&lt;a href=\"El%20Tepual%20Airport\"&gt;El Tepual Airport&lt;/a&gt; is the main commercial airport serving the city. Three airlines operate regular flights to and from &lt;a href=\"Santiago%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Punta%20Arenas\"&gt;Punta Arenas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balmaceda%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Balmaceda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Antofagasta%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Antofagasta&lt;/a&gt;. The airlines operating at the airport are &lt;a href=\"Latam%20Airlines\"&gt;Latam Airlines&lt;/a&gt; (the country's largest), &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Airline\"&gt;Sky Airline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"JetSmart\"&gt;JetSmart&lt;/a&gt;. The flight time to Santiago is approximately two hours.\nAdditionally, Marcel Marchant Aerodrome (La Paloma) connects the city with remote locations within the Patagonian Fjords.\nAdministration.\nAs a commune, Puerto Montt is a third-level &lt;a href=\"administrative%20division%20of%20Chile\"&gt;administrative division of Chile&lt;/a&gt; administered by a &lt;a href=\"municipal%20council\"&gt;municipal council&lt;/a&gt;, headed by an &lt;a href=\"Alcalde\"&gt;Alcalde&lt;/a&gt; with 10 councilors and represented in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; by 5 members and in the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; by 2 people and with support of a Regional Council of 6 members.\nSince 2012 the current Mayor has been Gervoy Paredes Rojas who was reelected at 2016 Municipal elections with an end term up to 2020 and the current members of the council are Fernado Espa\u00f1a Espa\u00f1a (&lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Party%20of%20Chile\"&gt;PS&lt;/a&gt;), Sonia Hernandez Asencio (PS), Luis Matamala Almonacid (&lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;PDC&lt;/a&gt;), Veronica Sanchez Silva (PDC), Juan Carlos Cuiti\u00f1o Uribe (&lt;a href=\"Green%20Ecologist%20Party%20%28Chile%29\"&gt;GEP&lt;/a&gt;), Rodrigo Wainraihgt Galilea (&lt;a href=\"National%20Renewal%20%28Chile%29\"&gt;RN&lt;/a&gt;), Fernando Orellana Perez (RN), Marcia Mu\u00f1oz Cochifas (IND), Hector Ulloa Aguilera (&lt;a href=\"Party%20for%20Democracy%20%28Chile%29\"&gt;PPD&lt;/a&gt;) and Leonardo Gonzales Saez (PPD).\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"electoral%20division%20of%20Chile\"&gt;electoral division of Chile&lt;/a&gt;, representatives of Puerto Montt, District 26 (Puerto Montt, &lt;a href=\"Cocham%C3%B3\"&gt;Cocham\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maull%C3%ADn\"&gt;Maull\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calbuco\"&gt;Calbuco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castro%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Castro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ancud\"&gt;Ancud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quemchi\"&gt;Quemchi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalcahue\"&gt;Dalcahue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Curaco%20de%20V%C3%A9lez\"&gt;Curaco de V\u00e9lez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quinchao\"&gt;Quinchao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Puqueld%C3%B3n\"&gt;Puqueld\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chonchi\"&gt;Chonchi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queil%C3%A9n\"&gt;Queil\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quell%C3%B3n\"&gt;Quell\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chait%C3%A9n\"&gt;Chait\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hualaihu%C3%A9\"&gt;Hualaihu\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Futaleuf%C3%BA%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Futaleuf\u00fa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Palena%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Palena&lt;/a&gt;) in the Chambers of Deputies 2018-2022 are Jenny \u00c1lvarez Vera (PS), Gabriel Ascencio Mansilla (PDC), Alejandro Santana Tirachini (RN), Carlos Kuschel Silva (RN) and Alejandro Bernales (&lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;). \nThe current Representatives in the Senate period 2014-2022 are Rabindranath Quinteros Lara (PS) and Ivan Moreira Barros (&lt;a href=\"Independent%20Democratic%20Union\"&gt;UDI&lt;/a&gt;).\nRegional councilors members 2018-2022 are Ricardo Kuschel Silva (RN), Jaime Brahm Barril (RN), Juan Ortiz Roble (UDI), Manuel Rivera Altamirano (PS), Juan Carcamo Carcamo (PDC) and Valentina Alvarez (Ind/PPD).\nEducation.\nPuerto Montt has 175 registered school varying from &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20Chile\"&gt;educational levels&lt;/a&gt; such as pre-school, primary school, secondary school, special school as well as technical-professional and adult schools.\nUniversities"
