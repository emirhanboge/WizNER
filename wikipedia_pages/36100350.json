    "text": "Stadsg\u00e5rden commonly refers to the &lt;a href=\"wharf\"&gt;wharf&lt;/a&gt; on the shore of the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, located between &lt;a href=\"Slussen\"&gt;Slussen&lt;/a&gt; in the west and &lt;a href=\"Masthamnen\"&gt;Masthamnen&lt;/a&gt; in the east. The word \"g\u00e5rd\" in the name comes from \"skeppsg\u00e5rd\", which was a word used in archaic &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20language\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; for an area used for port and dock operations.\nHistory.\n\"Stadsg\u00e5rden\" (\"Stadens skeppg\u00e5rd\") originally constituted only the western, broader part of the shore, near to a steep cliff face on &lt;a href=\"Fj%C3%A4llgatan\"&gt;Fj\u00e4llgatan&lt;/a&gt;. The name is credited to have first occurred in 1448, in a text mentioning \"en tompt vppa sudra malm belegna vidh Stadz garden\". At least from the early 14th century, so called \"&lt;a href=\"whale%20oil\"&gt;tran&lt;/a&gt; boats\" or \"&lt;a href=\"pinniped\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt; boats\" lay fastened to poles on the water around the area. In the boats, seal fat from the &lt;a href=\"Stockholm%20archipelago\"&gt;Stockholm archipelago&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bothnian%20Sea\"&gt;Bothnian Sea&lt;/a&gt; was cooked, and the resulting whale oil from this smelly contraption was packed in cans and sold further. The boats were left until the start of the 17th century.\nA certain building, containing &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt;, was prominent in the area. In Stockholm's privilege letter from 1594, proposals to tear down this building to give place for ship construction docks were mentioned:\nShip construction on the area was probably started in 1687 when the \"S\u00f6dra varvet\" in &lt;a href=\"Tegelviken\"&gt;Tegelviken&lt;/a&gt; was founded. In the \"Karta \u00f6fver S:ta Catharina f\u00f6rsamling\" from 1674, a long row of narrow lots towards &lt;a href=\"Saltsj%C3%B6n\"&gt;Saltsj\u00f6n&lt;/a&gt; is visible, but no road connecting them. On the map, Tegelvik remains a bay, bearing the name \"Skjeps-hwarfwet\". In the 17th and 18th centuries, the name \"Skeppsbron\", or \"Nya Skeppsbron\", is also mentioned, relating to &lt;a href=\"Skeppsbron\"&gt;Skeppsbron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gamla%20stan\"&gt;Gamla stan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn an attempt by city architect &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Eberhard\"&gt;Johan Eberhard&lt;/a&gt; to improve the Stadsg\u00e5rden docks in the end of the 1730s, a long wooden wharf was built. From the wharf, &lt;a href=\"hay\"&gt;hay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; were distributed to be transported across the sea. In wintertime, the wharf was used by many \"vinterliggarna\".\nWork to replace the wooden wharf by a stone construction proceeded very slowly because of the great depth of water. From 1875 to 1882, a new wooden wharf was built instead, resting on three rows of poles, with a length of 528 metres. &lt;a href=\"Railway\"&gt;Railway&lt;/a&gt; tracks were laid down on the wharf and connected with the \"Sammanbindningsbanan\" in Stockholm and the Skeppsbro wharf track. A magazine was built in 1883, and from 1888 to 1889 the \"Lilla Tullhuset\" was built. During the name revision in 1885, the name for the area between Slussen and Tegelviksplan was established as \"Stadsg\u00e5rden\", having previously (1849) been called Stadsg\u00e5rdhamnen.\nIn the late 19th century, a railway track, &lt;a href=\"Saltsj%C3%B6banan\"&gt;Saltsj\u00f6banan&lt;/a&gt;, was built and completed on 1 July 1893. The Stadsg\u00e5rden railway station was in use from 23 December 1893 to 21 December 1936, when it was moved to Slussen. The station building, dating from 1914, was sold to Stockholm's Christian Seaman Care, and the building became known as \"Sj\u00f6mansinstitutes hus\".\nWork between 1911 and 1915 replaced the old wooden wharf with a &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;-enforced &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; wharf, which was 12 metres longer than the old wharf. At the same time, the sea bed around the wharf was scooped.\nStadsg\u00e5rdleden and Stadsg\u00e5rdhamnen.\nThe traffic way \"Stadsg\u00e5rdleden\" was named in 1986 and replaced a large part of the older traffic way. The traffic way is about 1.3 &lt;a href=\"kilometre\"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; long, and the way from &lt;a href=\"S%C3%B6der%20M%C3%A4larstrand\"&gt;S\u00f6der M\u00e4larstrand&lt;/a&gt; passes by S\u00f6dra J\u00e4rngraven, Saltsj\u00f6rampen, &lt;a href=\"Franska%20bukten\"&gt;Franska bukten&lt;/a&gt;, Stadsg\u00e5rdhamnen, &lt;a href=\"Katarinabergen\"&gt;Katarinabergen&lt;/a&gt; and Tegelviksslingan. The major attraction in the west is the &lt;a href=\"Katarina%20Elevator\"&gt;Katarina Elevator&lt;/a&gt; and in the east, the cliff with &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A5f%C3%A4ngan\"&gt;F\u00e5f\u00e4ngan&lt;/a&gt; on its top. &lt;a href=\"Stadsg%C3%A5rdhissen\"&gt;Stadsg\u00e5rdhissen&lt;/a&gt; is located halfway between Slussen and Tegelviksplan, and from there, the 638-metre &lt;a href=\"Stadsg%C3%A5rdtunneln\"&gt;Stadsg\u00e5rdtunneln&lt;/a&gt;, located on the Saltsj\u00f6banan railway track, begins. Today, \"Stadsg\u00e5rden\" refers to the 300-metre road part connection \u00d6stra Slussgatan with Stadsg\u00e5rdleden. Along \"Stadsg\u00e5rdhamnen\", the Stockholm city wharves can be found, with terminals for &lt;a href=\"cruise%20ferry\"&gt;cruise ferries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea%20cruiseferries\"&gt;ferries to Finland&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Viking%20Line\"&gt;Viking Line&lt;/a&gt; terminal."
