    "text": "Cleveland ( ), officially the City of Cleveland, is a major city in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cuyahoga%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cuyahoga County&lt;/a&gt;. It is located along the southern shore of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Erie\"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt;, across the U.S. &lt;a href=\"Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border\"&gt;maritime border&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and approximately west of the Ohio-&lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; state border.\nThe largest city on Lake Erie and one of the most populous urban areas in the country, Cleveland anchors the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Cleveland\"&gt;Greater Cleveland Metropolitan Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt; (MSA) and the &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Ohio\"&gt;Cleveland\u2013Akron\u2013Canton Combined Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt; (CSA). The CSA is the most populous &lt;a href=\"combined%20statistical%20area\"&gt;combined statistical area&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio and the 17th largest in the United States, with a population of 3,633,962 in 2020. The city proper, with a 2020 population of 372,624, ranks as the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20cities%20by%20population\"&gt;54th-largest city&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., as a larger portion of the metropolitan population lives outside the central city. The seven-county metropolitan Cleveland economy, which includes &lt;a href=\"Akron%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Akron&lt;/a&gt;, is the largest in the state.\nCleveland was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Cuyahoga%20River\"&gt;Cuyahoga River&lt;/a&gt; by General &lt;a href=\"Moses%20Cleaveland\"&gt;Moses Cleaveland&lt;/a&gt;, after whom the city was named. It grew into a major manufacturing center due to its location on both the river and the lake shore, as well as numerous canals and &lt;a href=\"Rail%20transportation%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;railroad&lt;/a&gt; lines. A &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Cleveland\"&gt;port city&lt;/a&gt;, Cleveland is connected to the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Lawrence%20Seaway\"&gt;Saint Lawrence Seaway&lt;/a&gt;. The city's &lt;a href=\"Economy%20of%20Greater%20Cleveland\"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt; relies on diversified sectors such as manufacturing, financial services, &lt;a href=\"Health%20care%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;healthcare&lt;/a&gt;, biomedicals, and higher education. The gross domestic product (GDP) for the Greater Cleveland MSA was $135\u00a0billion in 2019. Combined with the &lt;a href=\"Akron%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Akron MSA&lt;/a&gt;, the seven-county Cleveland\u2013Akron metropolitan economy was $175\u00a0billion in 2019, the largest in Ohio, accounting for 25% of the state's GDP.\nDesignated as a \"Gamma -\" &lt;a href=\"global%20city\"&gt;global city&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Globalization%20and%20World%20Cities%20Research%20Network\"&gt;Globalization and World Cities Research Network&lt;/a&gt;, the city's major cultural institutions include the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History\"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Orchestra\"&gt;Cleveland Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Playhouse%20Square\"&gt;Playhouse Square&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. Known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Forest%20City\"&gt;The Forest City&lt;/a&gt;\" among many other &lt;a href=\"Nicknames%20of%20Cleveland\"&gt;nicknames&lt;/a&gt;, Cleveland serves as the center of the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Metroparks\"&gt;Cleveland Metroparks&lt;/a&gt; nature reserve system. The city's &lt;a href=\"Major%20professional%20sports%20leagues%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Canada\"&gt;major league&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sports%20in%20Cleveland\"&gt;professional sports teams&lt;/a&gt; include the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Browns\"&gt;Cleveland Browns&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Cavaliers\"&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Guardians\"&gt;Cleveland Guardians&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\nCleveland was established on July 22, 1796, by surveyors of the &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%20Land%20Company\"&gt;Connecticut Land Company&lt;/a&gt; when they laid out &lt;a href=\"Connecticut\"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%20Western%20Reserve\"&gt;Western Reserve&lt;/a&gt; into townships and a capital city. They named the new settlement \"Cleaveland\" after their leader, General &lt;a href=\"Moses%20Cleaveland\"&gt;Moses Cleaveland&lt;/a&gt;. Cleaveland oversaw the &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;-style design of the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on &lt;a href=\"Public%20Square%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Public Square&lt;/a&gt;, before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first permanent European settler in Cleaveland was &lt;a href=\"Lorenzo%20Carter\"&gt;Lorenzo Carter&lt;/a&gt;, who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River.\nThe settlement served as an important supply post for the U.S. during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Lake%20Erie\"&gt;Battle of Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%201812\"&gt;War of 1812&lt;/a&gt;. Locals adopted Commodore &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Hazard%20Perry\"&gt;Oliver Hazard Perry&lt;/a&gt; as a civic hero and erected a &lt;a href=\"Perry%20Monument%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;monument in his honor&lt;/a&gt; decades later. The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814. In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, the town's waterfront location proved to be an advantage, giving it access to Great Lakes trade. It grew rapidly after the 1832 completion of the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20and%20Erie%20Canal\"&gt;Ohio and Erie Canal&lt;/a&gt;. This key link between the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20River\"&gt;Ohio River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes\"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; connected it to the Atlantic Ocean via the &lt;a href=\"Erie%20Canal\"&gt;Erie Canal&lt;/a&gt; and Hudson River, and later via the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Lawrence%20Seaway\"&gt;Saint Lawrence Seaway&lt;/a&gt;. Its products could reach markets on the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;. The town's growth continued with added railroad links.\nIn 1831, the spelling of the town's name was altered by \"The Cleveland Advertiser\" newspaper. In order to fit the name on the newspaper's &lt;a href=\"Nameplate%20%28publishing%29\"&gt;masthead&lt;/a&gt;, the editors dropped the first \"a\", reducing the city's name to \"Cleveland\", which eventually became the official spelling. In 1836, Cleveland, then only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, was officially incorporated as a city. That same year, it nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20City%20%28Cuyahoga%20County%29%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Ohio City&lt;/a&gt; over a bridge connecting the two communities. Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20annexation%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;annexation&lt;/a&gt; by Cleveland in 1854.\nHome to a vocal group of &lt;a href=\"Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;abolitionists&lt;/a&gt;, Cleveland (code-named \"Station Hope\") was a major stop on the &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Railroad\"&gt;Underground Railroad&lt;/a&gt; for escaped &lt;a href=\"African%20Americans\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; en route to &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. The city also served as an &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;important center&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. Decades later, in July 1894, the wartime contributions of those serving the Union from Cleveland and Cuyahoga County would be honored with the opening of the city's &lt;a href=\"Soldiers%27%20and%20Sailors%27%20Monument%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument&lt;/a&gt; on Public Square.\nGrowth and expansion.\nAfter the war, the city witnessed rapid growth. Its prime geographic location as a transportation hub between the East Coast and the Midwest played an important role in its development as a commercial center. In 1874, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Woman%27s%20National%20Temperance%20Convention\"&gt;First Woman's National Temperance Convention&lt;/a&gt; was held in Cleveland, and adopted the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Woman%27s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union\"&gt;Woman's Christian Temperance Union&lt;/a&gt;. Cleveland served as a destination for iron ore shipped from &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, along with coal transported by rail. In 1870, &lt;a href=\"John%20D.%20Rockefeller\"&gt;John D. Rockefeller&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Oil\"&gt;Standard Oil&lt;/a&gt; in Cleveland. In 1885, he moved its headquarters to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, which had become a center of finance and business.\nBy the early 20th century, Cleveland had emerged as a major American manufacturing center. Its businesses included automotive companies such as &lt;a href=\"Peerless\"&gt;Peerless&lt;/a&gt;, People's, &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Motor%20Car%20Company\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chandler%20Motor%20Car\"&gt;Chandler&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Winton%20Motor%20Carriage%20Company\"&gt;Winton&lt;/a&gt;, maker of the first car driven across the U.S. Other manufacturers in Cleveland produced &lt;a href=\"steam%20car\"&gt;steam-powered&lt;/a&gt; cars, which included those by &lt;a href=\"White%20Motor%20Company\"&gt;White&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaeth\"&gt;Gaeth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"electric%20car\"&gt;electric car&lt;/a&gt;s produced by &lt;a href=\"Baker%20Motor%20Vehicle\"&gt;Baker&lt;/a&gt;. The city's industrial growth was accompanied by significant &lt;a href=\"Strike%20action\"&gt;strikes&lt;/a&gt; and labor unrest, as workers demanded better working conditions. In 1881\u201386, 70-80% of strikes were successful in improving labor conditions in Cleveland.\nKnown as the \"Sixth City\" due to its position as the sixth largest U.S. city at the time, Cleveland counted major &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Era\"&gt;Progressive Era&lt;/a&gt; politicians among its leaders, most prominently the &lt;a href=\"Populism\"&gt;populist&lt;/a&gt; Mayor &lt;a href=\"Tom%20L.%20Johnson\"&gt;Tom L. Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, who was responsible for the development of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Mall%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;Cleveland Mall Plan&lt;/a&gt;. The era of the &lt;a href=\"City%20Beautiful%20movement\"&gt;City Beautiful movement&lt;/a&gt; in Cleveland architecture, this period also saw wealthy patrons support the establishment of the city's major cultural institutions. The most prominent among them were the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;, which opened in 1916, and the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Orchestra\"&gt;Cleveland Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1918.\nCleveland's economic growth and industrial jobs attracted large waves of &lt;a href=\"Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;immigrants&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Europe\"&gt;Southern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Ireland%20%281801%E2%80%931923%29\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. African American migrants from the rural &lt;a href=\"Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt; also arrived in Cleveland (among other Northeastern and Midwestern cities) as part of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29\"&gt;Great Migration&lt;/a&gt; for jobs, constitutional rights, and relief from &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Crow%20laws\"&gt;racial discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1910 and 1930, the African American population of Cleveland grew by more than 400%. By 1920, the year in which the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Guardians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; won their &lt;a href=\"1920%20World%20Series\"&gt;first World Series championship&lt;/a&gt;, Cleveland had grown into a densely-populated metropolis of 796,841 with a foreign-born population of 30%, making it the fifth largest city in the nation. At this time, Cleveland saw the rise of radical labor movements in response to the conditions of the largely immigrant and migrant workers. In 1919, the city attracted national attention amid the &lt;a href=\"First%20Red%20Scare\"&gt;First Red Scare&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"May%20Day%20riots%20of%201919\"&gt;Cleveland May Day Riots&lt;/a&gt;, in which &lt;a href=\"socialism\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; demonstrators clashed with anti-socialists.\nDespite the immigration restrictions of &lt;a href=\"Emergency%20Quota%20Act\"&gt;1921&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Immigration%20Act%20of%201924\"&gt;1924&lt;/a&gt;, the city's population continued to grow throughout the 1920s. &lt;a href=\"Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Prohibition&lt;/a&gt; first took effect in Ohio in May 1919 (although it was not well-enforced in Cleveland), became law with the &lt;a href=\"Volstead%20Act\"&gt;Volstead Act&lt;/a&gt; in 1920, and was eventually &lt;a href=\"Twenty-first%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;repealed&lt;/a&gt; nationally by &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; in 1933. The ban on alcohol led to the rise of &lt;a href=\"Speakeasy\"&gt;speakeasies&lt;/a&gt; throughout the city and organized crime gangs, such as the &lt;a href=\"Mayfield%20Road%20Mob\"&gt;Mayfield Road Mob&lt;/a&gt;, who smuggled bootleg liquor across &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Erie\"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt; from Canada into Cleveland. The &lt;a href=\"Roaring%20Twenties\"&gt;Roaring Twenties&lt;/a&gt; also saw the establishment of Cleveland's &lt;a href=\"Playhouse%20Square\"&gt;Playhouse Square&lt;/a&gt; and the rise of the risqu\u00e9 &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Cleveland%23Short%20Vincent\"&gt;Short Vincent&lt;/a&gt; entertainment district. The Bal-Masque balls of the &lt;a href=\"avant-garde\"&gt;avant-garde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kokoon%20Arts%20Club\"&gt;Kokoon Arts Club&lt;/a&gt; scandalized the city. &lt;a href=\"Jazz\"&gt;Jazz&lt;/a&gt; came to prominence in Cleveland during this period.\nIn 1929, the city hosted the first of many &lt;a href=\"National%20Air%20Races\"&gt;National Air Races&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Amelia%20Earhart\"&gt;Amelia Earhart&lt;/a&gt; flew to the city from &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Monica%2C%20California\"&gt;Santa Monica, California&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Air%20Derby\"&gt;Women's Air Derby&lt;/a&gt; (nicknamed the \"Powder Puff Derby\" by &lt;a href=\"Will%20Rogers\"&gt;Will Rogers&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Van%20Sweringen%20brothers\"&gt;Van Sweringen brothers&lt;/a&gt; commenced construction of the &lt;a href=\"Terminal%20Tower\"&gt;Terminal Tower&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skyscraper\"&gt;skyscraper&lt;/a&gt; in 1926 and, by the time it was dedicated in 1930, Cleveland had a population of over 900,000. The era of the &lt;a href=\"flapper\"&gt;flapper&lt;/a&gt; also marked the beginning of the golden age in Downtown Cleveland retail, centered on major department stores &lt;a href=\"Higbee%27s\"&gt;Higbee's&lt;/a&gt;, Bailey's, the &lt;a href=\"May%20Company%20Ohio\"&gt;May Company&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Taylor%20%26amp%3B%20Son\"&gt;Taylor's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halle%20Brothers%20Co.\"&gt;Halle's&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sterling-Lindner%20Co.\"&gt;Sterling Lindner Davis&lt;/a&gt;, which collectively represented one of the largest and most &lt;a href=\"fashion\"&gt;fashion&lt;/a&gt;able shopping districts in the country, often compared to New York's &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Avenue\"&gt;Fifth Avenue&lt;/a&gt;.\nCleveland was hit hard by the &lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929\"&gt;Wall Street Crash of 1929&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;. A center of &lt;a href=\"Labor%20unions%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;union activity&lt;/a&gt;, the city saw significant labor struggles in this period, including strikes by workers against &lt;a href=\"Fisher%20Body\"&gt;Fisher Body&lt;/a&gt; in 1936 and against &lt;a href=\"Republic%20Steel\"&gt;Republic Steel&lt;/a&gt; in 1937. The city was also aided by major federal works projects sponsored by President &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"New%20Deal\"&gt;New Deal&lt;/a&gt;. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20Exposition\"&gt;Great Lakes Exposition&lt;/a&gt; debuted in June 1936 at the city's &lt;a href=\"North%20Coast%20Harbor\"&gt;North Coast Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived by Cleveland's business leaders as a way to revitalize the city during the Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937.\nOn December 7, 1941, &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Imperial Japan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;attacked Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20declaration%20of%20war%20on%20the%20United%20States%20and%20the%20British%20Empire\"&gt;declared war&lt;/a&gt; on the United States. One of the victims of the attack was a Cleveland native, Rear Admiral &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20C.%20Kidd\"&gt;Isaac C. Kidd&lt;/a&gt;. The attack signaled America's entry into &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. A major hub of the \"&lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20of%20Democracy\"&gt;Arsenal of Democracy&lt;/a&gt;\", Cleveland under Mayor &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Lausche\"&gt;Frank Lausche&lt;/a&gt; contributed massively to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20home%20front%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;U.S. war effort&lt;/a&gt; as the fifth largest manufacturing center in the nation. During his tenure, Lausche also oversaw the establishment of the Cleveland Transit System, the predecessor to the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Cleveland%20Regional%20Transit%20Authority\"&gt;Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority&lt;/a&gt;.\nLate 20th and early 21st centuries.\nAfter the war, Cleveland initially experienced an economic boom, and businesses declared the city to be the \"best location in the nation\". In 1949, the city was named an &lt;a href=\"All-America%20City%20Award\"&gt;All-America City&lt;/a&gt; for the first time and, in 1950, its population reached 914,808. In sports, the Indians won the &lt;a href=\"1948%20World%20Series\"&gt;1948 World Series&lt;/a&gt;, the hockey team, the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Barons%20%281937%E2%80%931973%29\"&gt;Barons&lt;/a&gt;, became champions of the American Hockey League, and the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Browns\"&gt;Browns&lt;/a&gt; dominated professional &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s. As a result, along with track and boxing champions produced, Cleveland was declared the \"City of Champions\" in sports at this time. The 1950s also saw the rising popularity of a new music genre that local &lt;a href=\"WKNR\"&gt;WJW\u00a0(AM)&lt;/a&gt; disc jockey &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Freed\"&gt;Alan Freed&lt;/a&gt; dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"rock%20and%20roll\"&gt;rock and roll&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHowever, by the 1960s, Cleveland's economy began to slow down, and residents increasingly sought new housing in the suburbs, reflecting the national trends of suburban growth following federally subsidized highways. Industrial restructuring, particularly in the railroad and steel industries, resulted in the loss of numerous jobs in Cleveland and the region, and the city suffered economically. The &lt;a href=\"burning%20of%20the%20Cuyahoga%20River\"&gt;burning of the Cuyahoga River&lt;/a&gt; in June 1969 brought national attention to the issue of &lt;a href=\"Pollution%23Urban%20pollution\"&gt;industrial pollution&lt;/a&gt; in Cleveland and served as a catalyst for the &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20movement%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American environmental movement&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Housing%20discrimination%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Housing discrimination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"redlining\"&gt;redlining&lt;/a&gt; against African Americans led to racial unrest in Cleveland and numerous other Northern U.S. cities. In Cleveland, the &lt;a href=\"Hough%20riots\"&gt;Hough riots&lt;/a&gt; erupted from July 18 to 23, 1966, and the &lt;a href=\"Glenville%20Shootout\"&gt;Glenville Shootout&lt;/a&gt; took place from July 23 to 25, 1968. In November 1967, Cleveland became the first major American city to elect an African American mayor, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Stokes\"&gt;Carl B. Stokes&lt;/a&gt;, who served from 1968 to 1971 and played an instrumental role in restoring the Cuyahoga River.\nIn December 1978, during the turbulent tenure of &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Kucinich\"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt; as mayor, Cleveland became the first major American city since the Great Depression to enter into a &lt;a href=\"default%20%28finance%29\"&gt;financial default&lt;/a&gt; on federal loans. By the beginning of the 1980s, several factors, including changes in international &lt;a href=\"free%20trade\"&gt;free trade&lt;/a&gt; policies, inflation, and the &lt;a href=\"savings%20and%20loan%20crisis\"&gt;savings and loan crisis&lt;/a&gt;, contributed to &lt;a href=\"Early%201980s%20recession\"&gt;the recession&lt;/a&gt; that severely affected cities like Cleveland. While unemployment during the period peaked in 1983, Cleveland's rate of 13.8% was higher than the national average due to the closure of several steel production centers.\nThe city began a gradual economic recovery under Mayor &lt;a href=\"George%20Voinovich\"&gt;George V. Voinovich&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s. The downtown area saw the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Key%20Tower\"&gt;Key Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"200%20Public%20Square\"&gt;200 Public Square&lt;/a&gt; skyscrapers, as well as the development of the &lt;a href=\"Gateway%20Sports%20and%20Entertainment%20Complex\"&gt;Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex&lt;/a&gt;\u2014consisting of &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Field\"&gt;Progressive Field&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rocket%20Mortgage%20FieldHouse\"&gt;Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and the North Coast Harbor, including the &lt;a href=\"Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FirstEnergy%20Stadium\"&gt;FirstEnergy Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20Science%20Center\"&gt;Great Lakes Science Center&lt;/a&gt;. The city emerged from default in 1987.\nBy the turn of the 21st century, Cleveland succeeded in developing a more diversified economy and gained a national reputation as a center for healthcare and the arts. Additionally, it has become a national leader in environmental protection, with its successful cleanup of the Cuyahoga River. The city's downtown has experienced dramatic economic and population growth since 2010, but the overall population has continued to decline. Challenges remain for the city, with economic development of neighborhoods, improvement of &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Metropolitan%20School%20District\"&gt;city schools&lt;/a&gt;, and continued encouragement of new immigration to Cleveland being top municipal priorities.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The shore of Lake Erie is above &lt;a href=\"above%20mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;; however, the city lies on a series of irregular bluffs lying roughly parallel to the lake. In Cleveland these bluffs are cut principally by the &lt;a href=\"Cuyahoga%20River\"&gt;Cuyahoga River&lt;/a&gt;, Big Creek, and &lt;a href=\"Euclid%20Creek\"&gt;Euclid Creek&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe land rises quickly from the lake shore elevation of 569 feet. Public Square, less than inland, sits at an elevation of , and Hopkins Airport, inland from the lake, is at an elevation of .\nCleveland borders several &lt;a href=\"Inner%20suburb\"&gt;inner-ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"streetcar%20suburbs\"&gt;streetcar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt;s. To the west, it borders &lt;a href=\"Lakewood%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Lakewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20River%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Rocky River&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fairview%20Park%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Fairview Park&lt;/a&gt;, and to the east, it borders &lt;a href=\"Shaker%20Heights%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Shaker Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Heights%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cleveland Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Euclid%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;South Euclid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"East%20Cleveland%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;East Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;. To the southwest, it borders &lt;a href=\"Linndale%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Linndale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Parma%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Parma&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brook%20Park%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Brook Park&lt;/a&gt;. To the south, the city also borders &lt;a href=\"Newburgh%20Heights%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Newburgh Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuyahoga%20Heights%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cuyahoga Heights&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Heights%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Brooklyn Heights&lt;/a&gt; and to the southeast, it borders &lt;a href=\"Warrensville%20Heights%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Warrensville Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maple%20Heights%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Maple Heights&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Garfield%20Heights%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Garfield Heights&lt;/a&gt;. To the northeast, along the shore of Lake Erie, Cleveland borders &lt;a href=\"Bratenahl%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Bratenahl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Euclid%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Euclid&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitecture.\nCleveland's downtown architecture is diverse. Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20City%20Hall\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cuyahoga%20County%20Courthouse\"&gt;Cuyahoga County Courthouse&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Public%20Library\"&gt;Cleveland Public Library&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Public%20Auditorium\"&gt;Public Auditorium&lt;/a&gt;, are clustered around the open Cleveland Mall and share a common &lt;a href=\"neoclassical%20architecture\"&gt;neoclassical architecture&lt;/a&gt;. They were built in the early 20th century as the result of the 1903 Group Plan. They constitute one of the most complete examples of City Beautiful design in the United States.\nCompleted in 1927 and dedicated in 1930 as part of the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20City%20Center\"&gt;Cleveland Union Terminal&lt;/a&gt; complex, the Terminal Tower was the tallest building in North America outside New York City until 1964 and the tallest in the city until 1991. It is a prototypical &lt;a href=\"Beaux-Arts%20architecture\"&gt;Beaux-Arts&lt;/a&gt; skyscraper. The two newer skyscrapers on Public Square, Key Tower (currently the tallest building in Ohio) and the 200 Public Square, combine elements of &lt;a href=\"Art%20Deco\"&gt;Art Deco&lt;/a&gt; architecture with &lt;a href=\"postmodern%20architecture\"&gt;postmodern&lt;/a&gt; designs. Cleveland's architectural treasures also include the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Trust%20Company%20Building\"&gt;Cleveland Trust Company Building&lt;/a&gt;, completed in 1907 and renovated in 2015 as a downtown &lt;a href=\"Heinen%27s%20Fine%20Foods\"&gt;Heinen's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"supermarket\"&gt;supermarket&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Arcade\"&gt;Cleveland Arcade&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes called the Old Arcade), a five-story &lt;a href=\"arcade%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt; built in 1890 and renovated in 2001 as a &lt;a href=\"Hyatt\"&gt;Hyatt&lt;/a&gt; Regency Hotel.\nRunning east from Public Square through University Circle is &lt;a href=\"Euclid%20Avenue%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;Euclid Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, which was known for its prestige and elegance as a residential street. In the late 1880s, writer &lt;a href=\"Bayard%20Taylor\"&gt;Bayard Taylor&lt;/a&gt; described it as \"the most beautiful street in the world\". Known as \"Millionaires' Row\", Euclid Avenue was world-renowned as the home of such major figures as John D. Rockefeller, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Hanna\"&gt;Mark Hanna&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"John%20Hay\"&gt;John Hay&lt;/a&gt;.\nCleveland's landmark &lt;a href=\"ecclesiastical%20architecture\"&gt;ecclesiastical architecture&lt;/a&gt; includes the historic &lt;a href=\"Old%20Stone%20Church%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;Old Stone Church&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Cleveland and the &lt;a href=\"onion%20dome\"&gt;onion dome&lt;/a&gt;d &lt;a href=\"St.%20Theodosius%20Russian%20Orthodox%20Cathedral\"&gt;St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tremont%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Tremont&lt;/a&gt;, along with myriad ethnically inspired Roman Catholic churches.\nParks and nature.\nKnown locally as the \"Emerald Necklace\", the &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Law%20Olmsted\"&gt;Olmsted&lt;/a&gt;-inspired Cleveland Metroparks encircle Cleveland and Cuyahoga County. The city proper is home to the Metroparks' Brookside and Lakefront Reservations, as well as significant parts of the Rocky River, Washington, and Euclid Creek Reservations. The Lakefront Reservation, which provides public access to Lake Erie, consists of four parks: Edgewater Park, &lt;a href=\"Whiskey%20Island%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;Whiskey Island\u2013Wendy Park&lt;/a&gt;, East 55th Street Marina, and &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Park%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Gordon Park&lt;/a&gt;. Three more parks fall under the jurisdiction of the Euclid Creek Reservation: Euclid Beach, Villa Angela, and Wildwood Marina. Bike and hiking trails in the &lt;a href=\"Brecksville%20Reservation\"&gt;Brecksville&lt;/a&gt; and Bedford Reservations, along with Garfield Park further north, provide access to trails in the &lt;a href=\"Cuyahoga%20Valley%20National%20Park\"&gt;Cuyahoga Valley National Park&lt;/a&gt;. The extensive system of trails within Cuyahoga Valley National Park extends south into &lt;a href=\"Summit%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Summit County&lt;/a&gt;, offering access to &lt;a href=\"Summit%20Metro%20Parks\"&gt;Summit Metro Parks&lt;/a&gt; as well. Also included in the system is the renowned &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Metroparks%20Zoo\"&gt;Cleveland Metroparks Zoo&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1882. Located in Big Creek Valley, the zoo has one of the largest collections of &lt;a href=\"primate\"&gt;primate&lt;/a&gt;s in North America.\nThe Cleveland Metroparks provides ample opportunity for outdoor recreational activities. Hiking and biking trails, including single-track mountain bike trails, wind extensively throughout the parks. Rock climbing is available at Whipp's Ledges at the Hinckley Reservation. During the summer months, kayakers, paddle boarders, and rowing and sailing crews can be seen on the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie. In the winter months, downhill skiing, snowboarding, and tubing are available not far from downtown at the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Mills/Brandywine%20Ski%20Resort\"&gt;Boston Mills/Brandywine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20Valley%20Ski%20Area\"&gt;Alpine Valley&lt;/a&gt; ski resorts.\nIn addition to the Metroparks, the Cleveland Public Parks District oversees the city's neighborhood parks, the largest of which is the historic &lt;a href=\"Rockefeller%20Park\"&gt;Rockefeller Park&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is notable for its late 19th century landmark bridges, the Rockefeller Park Greenhouse, and the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Cultural%20Gardens\"&gt;Cleveland Cultural Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, which celebrate the city's ethnic diversity. Just outside of Rockefeller Park, the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Botanical%20Garden\"&gt;Cleveland Botanical Garden&lt;/a&gt; in University Circle, established in 1930, is the oldest civic garden center in the nation. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Cleveland%20Aquarium\"&gt;Greater Cleveland Aquarium&lt;/a&gt;, located in the historic FirstEnergy Powerhouse in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Flats\"&gt;Flats&lt;/a&gt;, is the only independent, free-standing aquarium in the state of Ohio.\nNeighborhoods.\nThe Cleveland City Planning Commission has officially designated 34 neighborhoods in Cleveland. Centered on Public Square, &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Cleveland\"&gt;Downtown Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; is the city's &lt;a href=\"central%20business%20district\"&gt;central business district&lt;/a&gt;, encompassing a wide range of subdistricts, such as the &lt;a href=\"Nine-Twelve%20District\"&gt;Nine-Twelve District&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Campus%20District\"&gt;Campus District&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Center%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;Civic Center&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Playhouse%20Square\"&gt;Playhouse Square&lt;/a&gt;. It also historically included the lively Short Vincent entertainment district, which emerged in the 1920s, reached its height in the 1940s and 1950s, and disappeared with the expansion of National City Bank in the late 1970s. Mixed-use areas, such as the &lt;a href=\"Warehouse%20District%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Warehouse District&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Cleveland%23Superior%20Arts%20District\"&gt;Superior Arts District&lt;/a&gt;, are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants, cafes, and bars. The number of downtown &lt;a href=\"condominium\"&gt;condominium&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"loft%20apartment\"&gt;lofts&lt;/a&gt;, and apartments has been on the increase since 2000 and especially 2010, reflecting the neighborhood's dramatic population growth. Recent downtown developments also include the &lt;a href=\"HealthLine\"&gt;Euclid Corridor Project&lt;/a&gt; and the revival of &lt;a href=\"East%204th%20Street%20District%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;East 4th Street&lt;/a&gt;.\nClevelanders geographically define themselves in terms of whether they live on the east or west side of the Cuyahoga River. The East Side includes the neighborhoods of &lt;a href=\"Buckeye%E2%80%93Shaker\"&gt;Buckeye\u2013Shaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buckeye%E2%80%93Woodhill\"&gt;Buckeye\u2013Woodhill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Central%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Collinwood\"&gt;Collinwood&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Euclid%E2%80%93Green\"&gt;Euclid\u2013Green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Fairfax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glenville%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Glenville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goodrich%E2%80%93Kirtland%20Park\"&gt;Goodrich\u2013Kirtland Park&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Asiatown%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Asiatown&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Hough%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Hough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kinsman%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Kinsman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lee%E2%80%93Miles\"&gt;Lee\u2013Miles&lt;/a&gt; (including Lee\u2013Harvard and Lee\u2013Seville), &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Pleasant%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Mount Pleasant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Clair%E2%80%93Superior\"&gt;St. Clair\u2013Superior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Union%E2%80%93Miles%20Park\"&gt;Union\u2013Miles Park&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"University%20Circle\"&gt;University Circle&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Little%20Italy%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Little Italy&lt;/a&gt;). The West Side includes the neighborhoods of &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Centre\"&gt;Brooklyn Centre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clark%E2%80%93Fulton\"&gt;Clark\u2013Fulton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cudell%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Cudell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detroit%E2%80%93Shoreway\"&gt;Detroit\u2013Shoreway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edgewater%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Edgewater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20City%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Ohio City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Brooklyn\"&gt;Old Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stockyards%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Stockyards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tremont%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Tremont&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Tremont%2C%20Cleveland%23Duck%20Island\"&gt;Duck Island&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"West%20Boulevard\"&gt;West Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;, and the four neighborhoods colloquially known as &lt;a href=\"West%20Park%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;West Park&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Kamm%27s%20Corners\"&gt;Kamm's Corners&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bellaire%E2%80%93Puritas%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Bellaire\u2013Puritas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hopkins%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Hopkins&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Cuyahoga%20Valley%2C%20Cleveland\"&gt;Cuyahoga Valley&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood (including &lt;a href=\"the%20Flats\"&gt;the Flats&lt;/a&gt;) is situated between the East and West Sides, while the &lt;a href=\"Broadway%E2%80%93Slavic%20Village\"&gt;Broadway\u2013Slavic Village&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood is sometimes referred to as the South Side.\nSeveral neighborhoods have begun to attract the return of the middle class that left the city for the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. These neighborhoods are on both the West Side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit\u2013Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the East Side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy). Much of the growth has been spurred on by attracting &lt;a href=\"creative%20class\"&gt;creative class&lt;/a&gt; members, which in turn is spurring new residential development. A live-work &lt;a href=\"zoning\"&gt;zoning&lt;/a&gt; overlay for the city's near East Side has facilitated the transformation of old industrial buildings into loft spaces for artists.\nClimate.\nTypical of the Great Lakes region, Cleveland exhibits a &lt;a href=\"continental%20climate\"&gt;continental climate&lt;/a&gt; with four distinct seasons, which lies in the &lt;a href=\"humid%20continental\"&gt;humid continental&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; \"Dfa\") zone. Summers are hot and humid while winters are cold and snowy. The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east\u2013west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to &lt;a href=\"Sandusky%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Sandusky&lt;/a&gt;, but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the &lt;a href=\"lake-effect%20snow\"&gt;lake-effect snow&lt;/a&gt; that is typical in Cleveland (especially on the city's East Side) from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or early February. The lake effect also causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city: while Hopkins Airport, on the city's far West Side, has only reached of snowfall in a season three times since record-keeping for snow began in 1893, seasonal totals approaching or exceeding are not uncommon as the city ascends into the Heights on the east, where the region known as the '&lt;a href=\"Snowbelt\"&gt;Snow Belt&lt;/a&gt;' begins. Extending from the city's East Side and its suburbs, the Snow Belt reaches up the Lake Erie shore as far as &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe all-time record high in Cleveland of was established on June 25, 1988, and the all-time record low of was set on January 19, 1994. On average, July is the warmest month with a mean temperature of , and January, with a mean temperature of , is the coldest. Normal yearly &lt;a href=\"precipitation%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;precipitation&lt;/a&gt; based on the 30-year average from 1991 to 2020 is . The least precipitation occurs on the western side and directly along the lake, and the most occurs in the eastern suburbs. Parts of &lt;a href=\"Geauga%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Geauga County&lt;/a&gt; to the east receive over of liquid precipitation annually.\nDemographics.\nAt the 2020 &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt;, there were 372,624 people and 170,549 households in the city. The population density was .\nThe median income for a household in the city was $30,907. The per capita income for the city was $21,223. 32.7% of the population living below the poverty line. Of the city's population over the age of 25, 17.5% held a bachelor's degree or higher, and 80.8% had a high school diploma or equivalent.\nAccording to the 2010 census, 29.7% of Cleveland households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 22.4% were married couples living together, 25.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 6.0% had a male householder with no wife present, and 46.4% were non-families. 39.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.29 and the average family size was 3.11.\nIn 2010, the median age in the city was 35.7 years. 24.6% of residents were under the age of 18; 11% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.1% were from 25 to 44; 26.3% were from 45 to 64; and 12% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.0% male and 52.0% female.\nEthnicity.\nAccording to the 2020 census, the racial composition of the city was 40.0% &lt;a href=\"White%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, 48.8% African American, 0.5% &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt;, 2.6% &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Americans\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt;, and 4.4% from &lt;a href=\"Multiracial%20Americans\"&gt;two or more races&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans\"&gt;Hispanics or Latinos&lt;/a&gt; of any race were 11.9% of the population.\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Cleveland saw a massive influx of immigrants from Ireland, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; empires, most of whom were attracted by manufacturing jobs. As a result, Cleveland and Cuyahoga County today have substantial communities of &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Americans\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; (especially in Kamm's Corners and other areas of West Park), &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Americans\"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt; (especially in Little Italy and around &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20322\"&gt;Mayfield Road&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"German%20Americans\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt;, and several &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt;-Eastern European ethnicities, including &lt;a href=\"Czech%20American\"&gt;Czechs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Americans\"&gt;Hungarians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20American\"&gt;Lithuanians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Americans\"&gt;Poles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20American\"&gt;Romanians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Americans\"&gt;Russians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rusyn%20Americans\"&gt;Rusyns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slovak%20American\"&gt;Slovaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20American\"&gt;Ukrainians&lt;/a&gt;, and ex-&lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslav&lt;/a&gt; groups, such as &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20Americans\"&gt;Slovenes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20American\"&gt;Croats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20American\"&gt;Serbs&lt;/a&gt;. The presence of &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Ohioans%23Hungarians%20in%20Cleveland\"&gt;Hungarians within Cleveland proper&lt;/a&gt; was, at one time, so great that the city boasted the highest concentration of Hungarians in the world outside of &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;. Cleveland has a long-established &lt;a href=\"Jews%20and%20Judaism%20in%20Greater%20Cleveland\"&gt;Jewish community&lt;/a&gt;, historically centered on the East Side neighborhoods of Glenville and Kinsman, but now mostly concentrated in East Side suburbs such as Cleveland Heights and &lt;a href=\"Beachwood%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Beachwood&lt;/a&gt;, home to the &lt;a href=\"Maltz%20Museum%20of%20Jewish%20Heritage\"&gt;Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe availability of jobs also attracted African Americans from the South. Between 1920 and 1970, the black population of Cleveland, largely concentrated on the city's East Side, increased significantly as a result of the First and &lt;a href=\"Second%20Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29\"&gt;Second Great Migrations&lt;/a&gt;. Cleveland's Latino community consists primarily of &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Ricans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Puerto Ricans&lt;/a&gt;, who make up over 80% of the city's Hispanic/Latino population, as well as smaller numbers of immigrants from &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Republic\"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Central%20America\"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. The city's Asian community, centered on historical Asiatown, consists of &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Americans\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Americans\"&gt;Koreans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vietnamese%20Americans\"&gt;Vietnamese&lt;/a&gt;, and other groups. Additionally, the city and the county have significant communities of &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Americans\"&gt;Albanians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arab%20American\"&gt;Arabs&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20Americans\"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Americans\"&gt;Syrians&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Palestinian%20Americans\"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20Americans\"&gt;Armenians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"French%20American\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greek%20American\"&gt;Greeks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20Americans\"&gt;Iranians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Americans\"&gt;Scots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Americans\"&gt;Turks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"West%20Indian%20American\"&gt;West Indians&lt;/a&gt;. A 2020 analysis found Cleveland to be the most ethnically and racially diverse city in Ohio.\nMany ethnic festivals are held in Cleveland throughout the year, such as the annual &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Feast%20of%20the%20Assumption%20Festival\"&gt;Feast of the Assumption&lt;/a&gt; in Little Italy, Russian &lt;a href=\"Maslenitsa\"&gt;Maslenitsa&lt;/a&gt; in Rockefeller Park, the Cleveland Puerto Rican Parade and Festival in Clark\u2013Fulton, the Cleveland Asian Festival in Asiatown, the Greek Festival in Tremont, and the Romanian Festival in West Park. Vendors at the &lt;a href=\"West%20Side%20Market\"&gt;West Side Market&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio City offer many ethnic foods for sale. Cleveland also hosts annual Polish &lt;a href=\"%C5%9Amigus-dyngus\"&gt;Dyngus Day&lt;/a&gt; and Slovene &lt;a href=\"Kurentovanje\"&gt;Kurentovanje&lt;/a&gt; celebrations. The city's annual &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Patrick%27s%20Day\"&gt;Saint Patrick's Day&lt;/a&gt; parade brings hundreds of thousands to the streets of Downtown. The &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Thyagaraja%20Festival\"&gt;Cleveland Thyagaraja Festival&lt;/a&gt; held annually each spring at &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20State%20University\"&gt;Cleveland State University&lt;/a&gt; is the largest &lt;a href=\"Indian%20people\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; classical music and dance festival in the world outside of &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1946, the city has annually marked One World Day in the Cleveland Cultural Gardens in Rockefeller Park, celebrating all of its ethnic communities.\nReligion.\nThe influx of immigrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries drastically transformed Cleveland's religious landscape. From a homogeneous settlement of New England &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestants&lt;/a&gt;, it evolved into a city with a diverse religious composition. The predominant faith among Clevelanders today is &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, Protestant, and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodox%20Churches\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox&lt;/a&gt;), with &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; minorities.\nLanguage.\n, 85.3% of Cleveland residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language. 14.7% spoke a foreign language, including &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20language%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20language%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20language\"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt;, and various &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20languages\"&gt;Slavic languages&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Russian%20language%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polish%20language\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serbo-Croatian%20language\"&gt;Serbo-Croatian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Slovene%20language\"&gt;Slovene&lt;/a&gt;).\nImmigration.\nIn 1920, Cleveland proper boasted a foreign-born population of 30% and, in 1870, that percentage was 42%. Although the foreign-born population of Cleveland today is not as big as it once was, the sense of identity remains strong among the city's various ethnic communities, as reflected in the Cleveland Cultural Gardens. Within Cleveland, the neighborhoods with the highest foreign-born populations are Asiatown/Goodrich\u2013Kirtland Park (32.7%), Clark\u2013Fulton (26.7%), West Boulevard (18.5%), Brooklyn Centre (17.3%), Downtown (17.2%), University Circle (15.9%, with 20% in Little Italy), and Jefferson (14.3%). Recent waves of immigration have brought new groups to Cleveland, including &lt;a href=\"Ethiopian%20Americans\"&gt;Ethiopians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Asian%20Americans\"&gt;South Asians&lt;/a&gt;, as well as immigrants from &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Post-Soviet%20states\"&gt;former USSR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Europe\"&gt;Southeast Europe&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Asia\"&gt;East Asia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;. In the 2010s, the immigrant population of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County began to see significant growth, becoming one of the fastest growing centers for immigration in the Great Lakes region. A 2019 study found Cleveland to be the city with the shortest average processing time in the nation for immigrants to become &lt;a href=\"Citizenship%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U.S. citizens&lt;/a&gt;. The city's annual One World Day in Rockefeller Park includes a naturalization ceremony of new immigrants.\nEconomy.\nCleveland's location on the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie has been key to its growth. The Ohio and Erie Canal coupled with rail links helped the city become an important business center. Steel and many other manufactured goods emerged as leading industries. The city has since diversified its economy in addition to its manufacturing sector.\nEstablished in 1914, the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Reserve%20Bank%20of%20Cleveland\"&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; is one of 12 U.S. &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Reserve\"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Reserve%20Bank\"&gt;Banks&lt;/a&gt;. Its downtown building, located on East 6th Street and Superior Avenue, was completed in 1923 by the Cleveland architectural firm &lt;a href=\"Walker%20and%20Weeks\"&gt;Walker and Weeks&lt;/a&gt;. The headquarters of the Federal Reserve System's Fourth District, the bank employs 1,000 people and maintains branch offices in &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"chief%20executive%20officer\"&gt;chief executive officer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"president%20%28corporate%20title%29\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Loretta%20Mester\"&gt;Loretta Mester&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city is also home to the corporate headquarters of many large companies such as &lt;a href=\"Aleris\"&gt;Aleris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20Greetings\"&gt;American Greetings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Applied%20Industrial%20Technologies\"&gt;Applied Industrial Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mettler%20Toledo\"&gt;Mettler Toledo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cliffs%20Natural%20Resources\"&gt;Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eaton%20Corporation\"&gt;Eaton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forest%20City%20Enterprises\"&gt;Forest City Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;, Heinen's Fine Foods, &lt;a href=\"Hyster-Yale%20Materials%20Handling\"&gt;Hyster-Yale Materials Handling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Key%20Bank\"&gt;KeyCorp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20Electric\"&gt;Lincoln Electric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Medical%20Mutual%20of%20Ohio\"&gt;Medical Mutual of Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moen%20Incorporated\"&gt;Moen Incorporated&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NACCO%20Industries\"&gt;NACCO Industries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordson\"&gt;Nordson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"OM%20Group\"&gt;OM Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Parker-Hannifin\"&gt;Parker-Hannifin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PolyOne\"&gt;PolyOne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Corporation\"&gt;Progressive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RPM%20International\"&gt;RPM International&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sherwin-Williams%20Company\"&gt;Sherwin-Williams Company&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steris\"&gt;Steris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swagelok\"&gt;Swagelok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Things%20Remembered\"&gt;Things Remembered&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Third%20Federal%20S%26amp%3BL\"&gt;Third Federal S&amp;L&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TransDigm%20Group\"&gt;TransDigm Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Centers%20of%20America\"&gt;Travel Centers of America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vitamix\"&gt;Vitamix&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"NASA\"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; maintains a facility in Cleveland, the &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Research%20Center\"&gt;Glenn Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jones%20Day\"&gt;Jones Day&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest law firms in the U.S., was founded in Cleveland.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Clinic\"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; is the largest private employer in the city of Cleveland and the state of Ohio, with a workforce of over 50,000 . It carries the distinction as being among America's best hospitals with top ratings published in \"&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report\"&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;\". Cleveland's healthcare sector also includes &lt;a href=\"University%20Hospitals%20Cleveland%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MetroHealth\"&gt;MetroHealth&lt;/a&gt; medical center, and the insurance company Medical Mutual of Ohio. Cleveland is also noted in the fields of &lt;a href=\"biotechnology\"&gt;biotechnology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fuel%20cell\"&gt;fuel cell&lt;/a&gt; research, led by &lt;a href=\"Case%20Western%20Reserve%20University\"&gt;Case Western Reserve University&lt;/a&gt;, the Cleveland Clinic, and University Hospitals of Cleveland. The city is among the top recipients of investment for biotech start-ups and research.\nTechnology is another growing sector in Cleveland. In 2005, the city appointed a \"tech czar\" to recruit technology companies to the downtown office market, offering connections to the high-speed fiber networks that run underneath downtown streets in several \"high-tech offices\" focused on Euclid Avenue. Cleveland State University hired a technology transfer officer to cultivate technology transfers from CSU research to marketable ideas and companies in the Cleveland area. Local observers have noted that the city is transitioning from a manufacturing-based economy to a health-tech-based economy.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary education.\nThe Cleveland Metropolitan School District is the second-largest &lt;a href=\"K%E2%80%9312%20education\"&gt;K\u201312&lt;/a&gt; district in the state of Ohio. It is the only district in Ohio under the direct control of the mayor, who appoints a &lt;a href=\"board%20of%20education\"&gt;school board&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately of Cleveland, adjacent the &lt;a href=\"Shaker%20Square\"&gt;Shaker Square&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood, is part of the &lt;a href=\"Shaker%20Heights%20City%20School%20District\"&gt;Shaker Heights City School District&lt;/a&gt;. The area, which has been a part of the Shaker school district since the 1920s, permits these Cleveland residents to pay the same school taxes as the Shaker residents, as well as vote in the Shaker school board elections.\nPrivate and parochial schools within Cleveland proper include &lt;a href=\"Benedictine%20High%20School%20%28Cleveland%2C%20Ohio%29\"&gt;Benedictine High School&lt;/a&gt;, Birchwood School, &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Central%20Catholic%20High%20School\"&gt;Cleveland Central Catholic High School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20Gerson%20School\"&gt;Eleanor Gerson School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Montessori%20High%20School%20at%20University%20Circle\"&gt;Montessori High School at University Circle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Ignatius%20High%20School%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;St. Ignatius High School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Joseph%20Academy%20%28Cleveland%2C%20Ohio%29\"&gt;St. Joseph Academy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Villa%20Angela-St.%20Joseph%20High%20School\"&gt;Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School&lt;/a&gt;, Urban Community School, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Martin%20de%20Porres%20High%20School%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;St. Martin de Porres&lt;/a&gt;, and The Bridge Avenue School.\nHigher education.\nCleveland is home to a number of colleges and universities.

Under head librarian &lt;a href=\"William%20Howard%20Brett\"&gt;William Howard Brett&lt;/a&gt;, the library adopted an \"open shelf\" philosophy, which allowed patrons open access to the library's bookstacks. Brett's successor, &lt;a href=\"Linda%20Eastman\"&gt;Linda Eastman&lt;/a&gt;, became the first woman ever to lead a major library system in the world. She oversaw the construction of the library's main building on Superior Avenue, designed by Walker and Weeks and opened on May 6, 1925. &lt;a href=\"David%20Lloyd%20George\"&gt;David Lloyd George&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; from 1916 to 1922, laid the cornerstone for the building.

This is due in part to the success of &lt;a href=\"Frankie%20Yankovic\"&gt;Frankie Yankovic&lt;/a&gt;, a Cleveland native who was considered \"America's Polka King.\" The square at the intersection of Waterloo Road and East 152nd Street in Cleveland (), not far from where Yankovic grew up, was named in his honor.\nFilm and television.\nCleveland has served as the setting for many &lt;a href=\"Major%20film%20studio\"&gt;major studio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Independent%20film\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; films, and, early in &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American film history&lt;/a&gt;, it was even a center for film production. The first film shot in Cleveland was in 1897 by the &lt;a href=\"Edison%20Manufacturing%20Company\"&gt;Edison Company&lt;/a&gt;. Before &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; became the center for American cinema, filmmaker Samuel R. Brodsky and playwright Robert H. McLaughlin operated a studio at the &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Andrews%20%28chemist%29\"&gt;Andrews&lt;/a&gt; mansion on Euclid Avenue (now the &lt;a href=\"WEWS-TV\"&gt;WEWS-TV&lt;/a&gt; studio). There they produced major &lt;a href=\"silent%20film\"&gt;silent-era&lt;/a&gt; features, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Dangerous%20Toys%20%28film%29\"&gt;Dangerous Toys&lt;/a&gt;\" (1921), which are now considered &lt;a href=\"lost%20film\"&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt;. Brodsky also directed the weekly \"Plain Dealer Screen Magazine\" that ran in theaters in Cleveland and Ohio from 1917 to 1924.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"sound%20film\"&gt;talkie&lt;/a&gt;\" era, Cleveland featured in numerous &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Hollywood%20cinema\"&gt;classic Hollywood movies&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Hawks\"&gt;Howard Hawks&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Ceiling%20Zero\"&gt;Ceiling Zero&lt;/a&gt;\" (1936) with &lt;a href=\"James%20Cagney\"&gt;James Cagney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pat%20O%27Brien%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Pat O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hobart%20Henley\"&gt;Hobart Henley&lt;/a&gt;'s romantic comedy \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Pond\"&gt;The Big Pond&lt;/a&gt;\" (1930) with &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Chevalier\"&gt;Maurice Chevalier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Claudette%20Colbert\"&gt;Claudette Colbert&lt;/a&gt;, which introduced the hit song \"&lt;a href=\"You%20Brought%20a%20New%20Kind%20of%20Love%20to%20Me\"&gt;You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Curtiz\"&gt;Michael Curtiz&lt;/a&gt;'s 1933 &lt;a href=\"Pre-Code%20Hollywood\"&gt;pre-Code&lt;/a&gt; classic \"&lt;a href=\"Goodbye%20Again%20%281933%20film%29\"&gt;Goodbye Again&lt;/a&gt;\" with &lt;a href=\"Warren%20William\"&gt;Warren William&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Blondell\"&gt;Joan Blondell&lt;/a&gt; was set in Cleveland.

Cleveland mayor, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20R.%20White\"&gt;Michael R. White&lt;/a&gt;, worked with the NFL and Commissioner &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Tagliabue\"&gt;Paul Tagliabue&lt;/a&gt; to bring back the Browns beginning in the &lt;a href=\"1999%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1999 season&lt;/a&gt;, retaining all team history. In Cleveland's earlier football history, the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Bulldogs\"&gt;Cleveland Bulldogs&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Championship\"&gt;NFL Championship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1924%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1924&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Cleveland%20Rams\"&gt;Cleveland Rams&lt;/a&gt; won the NFL Championship in &lt;a href=\"1945%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1945&lt;/a&gt; before relocating to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cavaliers won the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Conference%20%28NBA%29\"&gt;Eastern Conference&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20NBA%20season\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20NBA%20season\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20NBA%20season\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20NBA%20season\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20NBA%20season\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt; but were defeated in the &lt;a href=\"2007%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20Spurs\"&gt;San Antonio Spurs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2015%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;then by&lt;/a&gt; the Golden State Warriors, respectively. The Cavs won the Conference again in 2016 and won their first NBA Championship coming back from a 3\u20131 deficit, finally defeating the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20State%20Warriors\"&gt;Golden State Warriors&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, an estimated 1.3\u00a0million people attended a parade held in the Cavs honor on June 22, 2016. This was the first time the city had planned for a championship parade in 50 years. Previously, the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Rosenblums\"&gt;Cleveland Rosenblums&lt;/a&gt; dominated the original &lt;a href=\"American%20Basketball%20League%20%281925%E2%80%9355%29\"&gt;American Basketball League&lt;/a&gt; winning three of the first five championships (1926, 1929, 1930), and the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Pipers\"&gt;Cleveland Pipers&lt;/a&gt;, owned by &lt;a href=\"George%20Steinbrenner\"&gt;George Steinbrenner&lt;/a&gt;, won the &lt;a href=\"American%20Basketball%20League%20%281961%E2%80%9363%29\"&gt;American Basketball League&lt;/a&gt; championship in 1962.\n&lt;a href=\"Jesse%20Owens\"&gt;Jesse Owens&lt;/a&gt; grew up in Cleveland after moving from &lt;a href=\"Alabama\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; when he was nine. He participated in the &lt;a href=\"1936%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1936 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin, where he achieved international fame by winning four &lt;a href=\"gold%20medal\"&gt;gold medal&lt;/a&gt;s. A statue commemorating his achievement can be found in Downtown Cleveland at Fort Washington Park. A statue of another famous Cleveland athlete, Irish American World Featherweight &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Kilbane\"&gt;Johnny Kilbane&lt;/a&gt;, stands in the city's Battery Park on the West Side.\nCleveland State University alum and area native &lt;a href=\"Stipe%20Miocic\"&gt;Stipe Miocic&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Fighting%20Championship\"&gt;UFC&lt;/a&gt; World Heavyweight Championship at &lt;a href=\"UFC%20198\"&gt;UFC 198&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. Miocic has defended his World Heavyweight Champion title at &lt;a href=\"UFC%20203\"&gt;UFC 203&lt;/a&gt;, the first ever UFC World Championship fight held in the city of Cleveland, and again at &lt;a href=\"UFC%20211\"&gt;UFC 211&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"UFC%20220\"&gt;UFC 220&lt;/a&gt;. After losing it in 2018, Miocic regained the world title at &lt;a href=\"UFC%20241\"&gt;UFC 241&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollegiately, &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;NCAA Division I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20State%20Vikings\"&gt;Cleveland State Vikings&lt;/a&gt; have 16 varsity sports, nationally known for their &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20State%20Vikings%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Cleveland State Vikings men's basketball&lt;/a&gt; team. &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20III\"&gt;NCAA Division III&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Case%20Western%20Reserve%20Spartans\"&gt;Case Western Reserve Spartans&lt;/a&gt; have 19 varsity sports, most known for their &lt;a href=\"Case%20Western%20Reserve%20Spartans%20football\"&gt;Case Western Reserve Spartans football&lt;/a&gt; team. The headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Mid-American%20Conference\"&gt;Mid-American Conference&lt;/a&gt; (MAC) are in Cleveland. The conference also stages both its &lt;a href=\"Mid-American%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;men's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mid-American%20Conference%20Women%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;women's&lt;/a&gt; basketball tournaments at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.\nSeveral chess championships have taken place in Cleveland. The second &lt;a href=\"American%20Chess%20Congress\"&gt;American Chess Congress&lt;/a&gt;, a predecessor the current U.S. Championship, was held in 1871, and won by &lt;a href=\"George%20Henry%20Mackenzie\"&gt;George Henry Mackenzie&lt;/a&gt;. The 1921 and 1957 &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Open%20Chess%20Championship\"&gt;U.S. Open Chess Championship&lt;/a&gt; also took place in the city, and were won by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Lasker\"&gt;Edward Lasker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Fischer\"&gt;Bobby Fischer&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Open%20%28chess%29\"&gt;Cleveland Open&lt;/a&gt; is held annually.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Marathon\"&gt;Cleveland Marathon&lt;/a&gt; has been hosted annually since 1978.\nEnvironment.\nWith its extensive cleanup of its Lake Erie shore and the Cuyahoga River, Cleveland has been recognized by national media as an environmental success story and a national leader in environmental protection. Since the city's industrialization, the Cuyahoga River had become so affected by industrial pollution that it \"caught fire\" a total of 13 times beginning in 1868. It was the river fire of June 1969 that spurred the city to action under Mayor Carl B. Stokes, and played a key role in the passage of the &lt;a href=\"Clean%20Water%20Act\"&gt;Clean Water Act&lt;/a&gt; in 1972 and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Environmental%20Policy%20Act\"&gt;National Environmental Policy Act&lt;/a&gt; later that year. Since that time, the Cuyahoga has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of the city and the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency\"&gt;Ohio Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; (OEPA). In 2019, the American Rivers conservation association named the river \"River of the Year\" in honor of \"50 years of environmental resurgence.\"\nIn addition to continued efforts to improve freshwater and air quality, Cleveland is now exploring renewable energy. The city's two main electrical utilities are &lt;a href=\"FirstEnergy\"&gt;FirstEnergy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Public%20Power\"&gt;Cleveland Public Power&lt;/a&gt;. Its &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20climate%20change%20initiatives\"&gt;climate action plan&lt;/a&gt;, updated in December 2018, has a 2050 target of 100 percent &lt;a href=\"Renewable%20energy\"&gt;renewable power&lt;/a&gt;, along with reduction of &lt;a href=\"Greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20by%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; to 80 percent below the 2010 level. In recent years, Cleveland has also been working to address the issue of &lt;a href=\"harmful%20algal%20bloom\"&gt;harmful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"algal%20bloom\"&gt;algal bloom&lt;/a&gt;s on Lake Erie, fed primarily by agricultural runoff, which have presented new environmental challenges for the city and for northern Ohio.\nGovernment and politics.\nCleveland operates on a &lt;a href=\"Strong-mayor\"&gt;mayor\u2013council (strong mayor)&lt;/a&gt; form of government, in which the mayor is the &lt;a href=\"executive%20%28government%29\"&gt;chief executive&lt;/a&gt;. From 1924 to 1931, the city briefly experimented with a &lt;a href=\"council%E2%80%93manager%20government\"&gt;council\u2013manager government&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"William%20R.%20Hopkins\"&gt;William R. Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20E.%20Morgan\"&gt;Daniel E. Morgan&lt;/a&gt; before returning to the mayor\u2013council system.\nThe office of the mayor has been held by &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Bibb\"&gt;Justin Bibb&lt;/a&gt; since 2022. Previous mayors of Cleveland include progressive Democrat Tom L. Johnson, &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;-era &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War\"&gt;War Secretary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"BakerHostetler\"&gt;BakerHostetler&lt;/a&gt; founder &lt;a href=\"Newton%20D.%20Baker\"&gt;Newton D. Baker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Hitz%20Burton\"&gt;Harold Hitz Burton&lt;/a&gt;, two-term Ohio Governor and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frank%20J.%20Lausche\"&gt;Frank J. Lausche&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services\"&gt;U.S. Health, Education, and Welfare Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20J.%20Celebrezze\"&gt;Anthony J. Celebrezze&lt;/a&gt;, two-term Ohio Governor and Senator George V. Voinovich, former U.S. Congressman Dennis Kucinich, and &lt;a href=\"Carl%20B.%20Stokes\"&gt;Carl B. Stokes&lt;/a&gt;, the first African American mayor of a major U.S. city.\nThe Cleveland City Council is lead by Council President Blaine Griffin. The city is broken up into 17 wards. Currently all 17 wards are represented by Democrats. The current majority leader of the council is Kerry McCormack. \nAnother nationally prominent Ohio politician, former U.S. President &lt;a href=\"James%20A.%20Garfield\"&gt;James A. Garfield&lt;/a&gt;, was born in Cuyahoga County's &lt;a href=\"Defunct%20townships%20of%20Cuyahoga%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Orange Township&lt;/a&gt; (today the Cleveland suburb of &lt;a href=\"Moreland%20Hills%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Moreland Hills&lt;/a&gt;). His resting place is the &lt;a href=\"James%20A.%20Garfield%20Memorial\"&gt;James A. Garfield Memorial&lt;/a&gt; in Cleveland's &lt;a href=\"Lake%20View%20Cemetery\"&gt;Lake View Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the Civil War era to the 1940s, Cleveland was primarily dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;, with the notable exceptions of the Johnson and Baker mayoral administrations. Businessman and Senator Mark Hanna was among Cleveland's most influential Republican figures, both locally and nationally. In addition to the established support of organized labor, the Cuyahoga County &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, led by former mayor &lt;a href=\"Ray%20T.%20Miller\"&gt;Ray T. Miller&lt;/a&gt;, was able to secure the support of the city's ethnic European and African American communities in the 1940s. Beginning with the Lausche administration, Cleveland's political orientation shifted to the Democratic Party and, with the exceptions of the &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Perk\"&gt;Perk&lt;/a&gt; and Voinovich administrations, it has remained dominated by the Democrats ever since.\nToday, while other parts of Ohio, particularly Cincinnati and the southern portion of the state, support the Republicans, Cleveland commonly produces the strongest support in the state for the Democrats. At the local level, elections are nonpartisan. However, Democrats still dominate every level of government. During the &lt;a href=\"2004%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2004 Presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; carried Ohio by 2.1%, &lt;a href=\"John%20Kerry\"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; carried Cuyahoga County 66.6%\u201332.9%, his largest margin in any Ohio county. The city of Cleveland supported Kerry over Bush by the even larger margin of 83.3%\u201315.8%. As a result of the 2010 Census, Ohio lost two Congressional seats, which affected Cleveland's districts in the northeast part of the state. Today, Cleveland is split between two &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20congressional%20districts\"&gt;congressional districts&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the western part of the city is in the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%27s%209th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;9th District&lt;/a&gt;, represented by &lt;a href=\"Marcy%20Kaptur\"&gt;Marcy Kaptur&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the eastern part of the city, as well as most of downtown, is in the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%27s%2011th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;11th District&lt;/a&gt;, represented by &lt;a href=\"Shontel%20Brown\"&gt;Shontel Brown&lt;/a&gt;. Both are Democrats, two of four representing Ohio.\nCleveland hosted three Republican &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20presidential%20nominating%20convention\"&gt;national conventions&lt;/a&gt; in its history, in &lt;a href=\"1924%20Republican%20National%20Convention\"&gt;1924&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1936%20Republican%20National%20Convention\"&gt;1936&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"2016%20Republican%20National%20Convention\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. The city also hosted the &lt;a href=\"Radical%20Republicans\"&gt;Radical Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Radical%20Democracy%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%23Cleveland%20convention\"&gt;convention of 1864&lt;/a&gt;. Cleveland has not hosted a national convention for the Democrats, despite the position of Cuyahoga County as a Democratic stronghold in Ohio.\nCleveland has hosted several national election debates, including the &lt;a href=\"1980%20United%20States%20presidential%20debates%23Second%20presidential%20debate%20%28Music%20Hall%29\"&gt;second 1980 U.S. Presidential debate&lt;/a&gt;, the , one , and the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20presidential%20debates%23September%2029%20presidential%20debate%20%28Case%20Western%20Reserve%20University%29\"&gt;first 2020 U.S. Presidential debate&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 1912, the &lt;a href=\"City%20Club%20of%20Cleveland\"&gt;City Club of Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; provides a platform for national and local debates and discussions. Known as Cleveland's \"Citadel of Free Speech,\" it is one of the oldest continuous independent free speech and debate forums in the country.\nPublic safety.\nPolice and law enforcement.\nLike in other major American cities, crime in Cleveland is concentrated in areas with higher rates of poverty and lower access to jobs. In recent years, the rate of crime in the city has seen a significant decline, following a nationwide trend in falling crime rates. Cleveland Police statistics published in 2019 showed that rates for violent crimes and property crimes in Cleveland dropped substantially in 2018. The rate of property crimes specifically fell by 30% since 2016.\nCleveland's law enforcement agency is the Cleveland Division of Police, established in 1866. The division has 1,444 sworn officers as of 2016. Cleveland has five police districts. The district system was introduced in the 1930s by Cleveland Public Safety Director &lt;a href=\"Eliot%20Ness\"&gt;Eliot Ness&lt;/a&gt; (of the &lt;a href=\"Untouchables%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;Untouchables&lt;/a&gt;), who later &lt;a href=\"1947%20Cleveland%20mayoral%20election\"&gt;ran for mayor of Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; in 1947. The division has been recognized for several \"firsts,\" including the \"first criminal conviction secured by matching a palm print lifted from a crime scene to a suspect.\" The current &lt;a href=\"chief%20of%20police\"&gt;Chief of Police&lt;/a&gt; is Calvin D. Williams.\nIn December 2014, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice\"&gt;United States Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; announced the findings of a two-year investigation, prompted by a request from Mayor Frank Jackson, to determine whether the Cleveland Police engaged in a pattern of excessive force. As a result of the Justice Department report, the city agreed to a consent decree to revise its policies and implement new independent oversight over the police force. The consent decree, released on May 26, 2015, mandated sweeping changes to the Cleveland Police. On June 12, 2015, Chief U.S. District Judge &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Oliver%20Jr.\"&gt;Solomon Oliver Jr.&lt;/a&gt; approved and signed the consent decree, beginning the process of police reform.\nFire department.\nCleveland is served by the &lt;a href=\"firefighter\"&gt;firefighter&lt;/a&gt;s of the Cleveland Division of Fire, established in 1863. The fire department operates out of 22 active fire stations throughout the city in five battalions. Each Battalion is commanded by a Battalion Chief, who reports to an on-duty Assistant Chief.\nThe Division of Fire operates a &lt;a href=\"fire%20apparatus\"&gt;fire apparatus&lt;/a&gt; fleet of twenty-two engine companies, eight ladder companies, three tower companies, two task force &lt;a href=\"rescue%20squad\"&gt;rescue squad&lt;/a&gt; companies, hazardous materials (\"haz-mat\") unit, and numerous other special, support, and reserve units. The current &lt;a href=\"fire%20chief\"&gt;Chief of Department&lt;/a&gt; is Angelo Calvillo.\nEmergency Medical Services.\nCleveland EMS is operated by the city as its own municipal third-service EMS division. Cleveland EMS is the primary provider of &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Life%20Support\"&gt;Advanced Life Support&lt;/a&gt; and ambulance transport within the city of Cleveland, while Cleveland Fire assists by providing fire response medical care. Although a merger between the fire and EMS departments was proposed in the past, the idea was subsequently abandoned.\nMedia.\nPrint.\nCleveland's primary daily newspaper is \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Plain%20Dealer\"&gt;The Plain Dealer&lt;/a&gt;\" and its associated online publication, \"Cleveland.com\". Defunct major newspapers include the \"&lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Press\"&gt;Cleveland Press&lt;/a&gt;\", an afternoon publication which printed its last edition on June 17, 1982; and the \"&lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20News\"&gt;Cleveland News&lt;/a&gt;\", which ceased publication in 1960. Additional publications include: the \"&lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Magazine\"&gt;Cleveland Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\", a regional culture magazine published monthly; \"&lt;a href=\"Crain%20Communications\"&gt;Crain's Cleveland Business&lt;/a&gt;\", a weekly business newspaper; and \"&lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Scene\"&gt;Cleveland Scene&lt;/a&gt;\", a free &lt;a href=\"Alternative%20newspaper\"&gt;alternative weekly&lt;/a&gt; paper which absorbed its competitor, the \"&lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Free%20Times\"&gt;Cleveland Free Times&lt;/a&gt;\", in 2008. Nationally distributed &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Music%20magazine\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Alternative%20Press%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Alternative Press&lt;/a&gt;\" was founded in Cleveland in 1985, and the publication's headquarters remain in the city. The digital \"&lt;a href=\"Belt%20Magazine\"&gt;Belt Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" was founded in Cleveland in 2013. \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine was published in Cleveland for a brief period from 1925 to 1927.\nCleveland's ethnic publications include: the \"&lt;a href=\"Call%20and%20Post\"&gt;Call and Post&lt;/a&gt;\", a weekly newspaper that primarily serves the city's African American community; the \"&lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Jewish%20News\"&gt;Cleveland Jewish News&lt;/a&gt;\", a weekly &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20newspaper\"&gt;Jewish newspaper&lt;/a&gt;; the bi-weekly &lt;a href=\"Russian%20language\"&gt;Russian language&lt;/a&gt; \"Cleveland Russian Magazine\" for the Russian and post-Soviet community; the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20language\"&gt;Mandarin&lt;/a&gt; \"Erie Chinese Journal\" for the city's Chinese community; \"La Gazzetta Italiana\" in English and &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; for the Italian community; the \"Ohio Irish American News\" for the Irish community; and the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish language&lt;/a&gt; \"Vocero Latino News\" for the Latino community. Historically, the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20language\"&gt;Hungarian language&lt;/a&gt; newspaper \"Szabads\u00e1g\" served the Hungarian community.\nTelevision.\nCleveland is the 19th-largest television market by &lt;a href=\"Nielsen%20Media%20Research\"&gt;Nielsen Media Research&lt;/a&gt; (\u201314). The market is served by 11 full power stations, including: WEWS-TV (&lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"WJW%20%28TV%29\"&gt;WJW&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"WKYC\"&gt;WKYC&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"WOIO\"&gt;WOIO&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"WVIZ\"&gt;WVIZ&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"PBS\"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"WUAB\"&gt;WUAB&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"The%20CW\"&gt;The CW&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"WVPX-TV\"&gt;WVPX-TV&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ion%20Television\"&gt;Ion&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"WQHS-DT\"&gt;WQHS-DT&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Univision\"&gt;Univision&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"WDLI-TV\"&gt;WDLI-TV&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Court%20TV\"&gt;Court TV&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"WRLM%20%28TV%29\"&gt;WRLM&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tri-State%20Christian%20Television\"&gt;TCT&lt;/a&gt;), and the independent &lt;a href=\"WBNX-TV\"&gt;WBNX-TV&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mike%20Douglas%20Show\"&gt;The Mike Douglas Show&lt;/a&gt;\", a nationally &lt;a href=\"Broadcast%20syndication\"&gt;syndicated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daytime%20television\"&gt;daytime&lt;/a&gt; talk show, began in Cleveland in 1961 on KYW-TV (now WKYC), while \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Morning%20Exchange\"&gt;The Morning Exchange&lt;/a&gt;\" on WEWS-TV served as the model for \"&lt;a href=\"Good%20Morning%20America\"&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Conway\"&gt;Tim Conway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ernie%20Anderson\"&gt;Ernie Anderson&lt;/a&gt; first established themselves in Cleveland while working together at KYW-TV and later WJW-TV (now WJW). Anderson both created and performed as the immensely popular Cleveland &lt;a href=\"horror%20host\"&gt;horror host&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ghoulardi\"&gt;Ghoulardi&lt;/a&gt; on WJW-TV's \"Shock Theater\", and was later succeeded by the long-running &lt;a href=\"Late%20night%20television\"&gt;late night&lt;/a&gt; duo &lt;a href=\"Big%20Chuck%20and%20Lil%27%20John\"&gt;Big Chuck and Lil' John&lt;/a&gt;.\nRadio.\nCleveland is directly served by 32 &lt;a href=\"AM%20broadcasting\"&gt;AM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FM%20broadcasting\"&gt;FM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Radio%20broadcasting\"&gt;radio stations&lt;/a&gt;, 22 of which are licensed to the city.

Sports oriented stations include WKNR (&lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Radio\"&gt;ESPN Radio&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"WARF\"&gt;WARF&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Fox%20Sports%20Radio\"&gt;Fox Sports Radio&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"WKRK-FM\"&gt;WKRK-FM&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"CBS%20Sports%20Radio\"&gt;CBS Sports Radio&lt;/a&gt;). WKNR and WKRK-FM are also co-flagship stations for the Cleveland Browns. As WJW (AM), WKNR was once the home of Alan Freed \u2212 the Cleveland disc jockey credited with first using and popularizing the term \"rock and roll\" to describe the music genre. News/talk station &lt;a href=\"WHK%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WHK&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first radio stations to broadcast in the United States and the first in Ohio. Its former sister station, rock station WMMS, dominated Cleveland radio in the 1970s and 1980s and was at that time one of the highest-rated radio stations in the country. In 1972, WMMS program director Billy Bass coined the phrase \"The Rock and Roll Capital of the World\" to describe Cleveland. In 1987, \"&lt;a href=\"Playboy\"&gt;Playboy&lt;/a&gt;\" named WMMS DJ &lt;a href=\"Kid%20Leo\"&gt;Kid Leo&lt;/a&gt; (Lawrence Travagliante) \"The Best Disc Jockey in the Country\".\nHealthcare.\nCleveland is home to a number of leading hospital systems, several of which are in University Circle. Most notable is the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic, currently led by &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;n-born president and CEO Tomislav Mihaljevic. The clinic is affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Case%20Western%20Reserve%20University%20School%20of%20Medicine\"&gt;Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The other major hospital in Cleveland is &lt;a href=\"University%20Hospitals%20Cleveland%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; with its &lt;a href=\"Rainbow%20Babies%20%26amp%3B%20Children%27s%20Hospital\"&gt;Rainbow Babies &amp; Children's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. Cliff Megerian serves as that system's CEO. On the city's West Side is the main campus of the &lt;a href=\"MetroHealth\"&gt;MetroHealth System&lt;/a&gt;, led by president and CEO Akram Boutros. Formerly known as City Hospital, MetroHealth operates one of two Level I trauma centers in the city, and has various locations throughout Greater Cleveland. Founded in 1865, the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Vincent%20Charity%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;St. Vincent Charity Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, led by CEO and president Janet Murphy, is the oldest hospital in the city.\nIn 2013, Cleveland's &lt;a href=\"Global%20Center%20for%20Health%20Innovation\"&gt;Global Center for Health Innovation&lt;/a&gt; opened with of display space for healthcare companies across the world. To take advantage of the proximity of universities and other medical centers in Cleveland, the &lt;a href=\"Veterans%20Administration\"&gt;Veterans Administration&lt;/a&gt; moved the region's VA hospital from suburban &lt;a href=\"Brecksville\"&gt;Brecksville&lt;/a&gt; to a new facility in University Circle.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;2020 COVID-19 pandemic in the United States&lt;/a&gt;, Ohio Governor &lt;a href=\"Mike%20DeWine\"&gt;Mike DeWine&lt;/a&gt; reported the earliest cases of the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Ohio\"&gt;virus in the state&lt;/a&gt; to be in the Greater Cleveland Metropolitan Area, specifically Cuyahoga County. In response, the Cleveland Clinic engaged in a historic partnership with University Hospitals to offer free testing for &lt;a href=\"Severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome%20coronavirus%202\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, to stop the spread of the virus in the metropolitan area and throughout the state.\nTransportation.\nWalkability.\nIn 2021, &lt;a href=\"Walk%20Score\"&gt;Walk Score&lt;/a&gt; ranked Cleveland the seventeenth most walkable of the fifty largest cities in the United States., with a Walk Score of 57, a Transit Score of 45, and a Bike Score of 55 (out of a maximum of 100). Cleveland's most walkable areas can be found in the Downtown, Ohio City, Detroit\u2013Shoreway, University Circle, and &lt;a href=\"Buckeye%E2%80%93Shaker\"&gt;Buckeye\u2013Shaker Square&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods.\nUrban transit systems.\nCleveland has a bus and &lt;a href=\"urban%20rail%20transit\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"public%20transport\"&gt;mass transit&lt;/a&gt; system operated by the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA). The rail portion is officially called the &lt;a href=\"RTA%20Rapid%20Transit\"&gt;RTA Rapid Transit&lt;/a&gt;, but local residents refer to it as \"The Rapid\". It consists of three &lt;a href=\"rapid%20transit\"&gt;light rail&lt;/a&gt; lines, known as the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Line%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Green%20Line%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt;, and Waterfront Lines, and a &lt;a href=\"heavy%20rail\"&gt;heavy rail&lt;/a&gt; line, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Line%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;Red Line&lt;/a&gt;. In 2008, RTA completed the HealthLine, a &lt;a href=\"bus%20rapid%20transit\"&gt;bus rapid transit&lt;/a&gt; line, for which naming rights were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. It runs along Euclid Avenue from downtown through University Circle, ending at the &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Stokes%20Station%20at%20Windermere\"&gt;Louis Stokes Station at Windermere&lt;/a&gt; in East Cleveland. RTA later opened a \"BRT Light\" line on the West Side along Clifton Blvd and the Shoreway. In 1968, Cleveland became the first city in the nation to have a direct rail transit connection linking the city's downtown to its major airport. In 2007, the &lt;a href=\"American%20Public%20Transportation%20Association\"&gt;American Public Transportation Association&lt;/a&gt; named Cleveland's mass transit system the best in North America. Cleveland is the only metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere with its rail rapid transit system having only one center-city area rapid transit station (Tower City-Public Square).\nPrivate automobiles.\nThe city of Cleveland has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2016, 23.7 percent of Cleveland households lacked a car, while the national average was 8.7 percent. Cleveland averaged 1.19 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8. Like other major cities, the urban density of Cleveland reduces the need for private vehicle ownership, though as jobs sprawl to urban edges across the United States, connectivity is becoming beyond the reach of public transit systems, including RTA.\nRoads.\nCleveland's road system consists of numbered streets running roughly north\u2013south, and named avenues, which run roughly east\u2013west. The numbered streets are designated \"east\" or \"west\", depending on where they lie in relation to Ontario Street, which bisects Public Square. The numbered street system extends beyond the city limits into some suburbs on both the West and East Sides. The named avenues that lie both on the east side of the Cuyahoga River and west of Ontario Street receive a \"west\" designation on street signage. The two downtown avenues which span the Cuyahoga change names on the west side of the river. Superior Avenue becomes Detroit Avenue on the West Side, and Carnegie Avenue becomes Lorain Avenue. The bridges that make these connections are often called the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%E2%80%93Superior%20Bridge\"&gt;Detroit\u2013Superior Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lorain%E2%80%93Carnegie%20Bridge\"&gt;Lorain\u2013Carnegie Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nFreeways.\nThree two-digit &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20highway\"&gt;Interstate highway&lt;/a&gt;s serve Cleveland directly. &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2071\"&gt;Interstate 71&lt;/a&gt; begins just southwest of downtown and is the major route from downtown Cleveland to the airport. I-71 runs through the southwestern suburbs and eventually connects Cleveland with &lt;a href=\"Columbus%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt; and Cincinnati. &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2077\"&gt;Interstate 77&lt;/a&gt; begins in downtown Cleveland and runs almost due south through the southern suburbs. I-77 sees the least traffic of the three interstates, although it does connect Cleveland to &lt;a href=\"Akron%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Akron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2090\"&gt;Interstate 90&lt;/a&gt; connects the two sides of Cleveland, and is the northern terminus for both I-71 and I-77. Running due east\u2013west through the West Side suburbs, I-90 turns northeast at the junction with and I-490, and is known as the Innerbelt through downtown. At the junction with the Shoreway, I-90 makes a 90-degree turn known in the area as &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Curve\"&gt;Dead Man's Curve&lt;/a&gt;, then continues northeast, entering &lt;a href=\"Lake%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Lake County&lt;/a&gt; near the eastern split with &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Route%202\"&gt;Ohio State Route 2&lt;/a&gt;. Cleveland is also served by two three-digit interstates, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20480%20%28Ohio%29\"&gt;Interstate 480&lt;/a&gt;, which enters Cleveland briefly at a few points and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20490%20%28Ohio%29\"&gt;Interstate 490&lt;/a&gt;, which connects I-77 with the junction of I-90 and I-71 just south of downtown. \nTwo other limited-access highways serve Cleveland. The &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Memorial%20Shoreway\"&gt;Cleveland Memorial Shoreway&lt;/a&gt; carries State Route 2 along its length, and at varying points also carries &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%206\"&gt;US 6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2020\"&gt;US 20&lt;/a&gt; and I-90. The Jennings Freeway (&lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Route%20176\"&gt;State Route 176&lt;/a&gt;) connects I-71 just south of I-90 to I-480 near the suburbs of Parma and Brooklyn Heights. A third highway, the Berea Freeway (&lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Route%20237\"&gt;State Route 237&lt;/a&gt; in part), connects I-71 to the airport and forms part of the boundary between Cleveland and Brook Park.\nAirports.\n&lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Hopkins%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Cleveland Hopkins International Airport&lt;/a&gt; is the city's major airport and an &lt;a href=\"international%20airport\"&gt;international airport&lt;/a&gt; that once served as a main &lt;a href=\"airline%20hub\"&gt;hub&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"United%20Airlines\"&gt;United Airlines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Continental%20Airlines\"&gt;Continental Airlines&lt;/a&gt;. It holds the distinction of having the first airport-to-downtown rapid transit connection in North America, established in 1968. In 1930, the airport was the site of the first airfield lighting system and the first air traffic &lt;a href=\"control%20tower\"&gt;control tower&lt;/a&gt;. Originally known as Cleveland Municipal Airport, it was the first municipally owned airport in the country. Cleveland Hopkins is a significant regional air freight hub hosting &lt;a href=\"FedEx%20Express\"&gt;FedEx Express&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UPS%20Airlines\"&gt;UPS Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Postal%20Service\"&gt;United States Postal Service&lt;/a&gt;, and major commercial freight carriers.\nIn addition to Hopkins, Cleveland is served by &lt;a href=\"Burke%20Lakefront%20Airport\"&gt;Burke Lakefront Airport&lt;/a&gt;, on the north shore of downtown between Lake Erie and the Shoreway. Burke is primarily a commuter and business airport.\nSeaport.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Cleveland\"&gt;Port of Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, at the Cuyahoga River's mouth, is a major bulk freight and container terminal on Lake Erie, receiving much of the raw materials used by the region's manufacturing industries. The Port of Cleveland is the only container port on the Great Lakes with bi-weekly container service between Cleveland and the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Antwerp\"&gt;Port of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; service called the \"Cleveland-Europe Express.\" In addition to freight, the Port of Cleveland also welcomes regional and international tourists who pass through the city on &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20passenger%20steamers\"&gt;Great Lakes cruises&lt;/a&gt;. Currently docking at Dock 28, just west of First Energy Stadium. The cruises currently run from mid-May through mid-October.\nRailroads.\nCleveland has a long rich history as a major railroad hub in the United States. Today, &lt;a href=\"Amtrak\"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt;, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Cleveland, via the \"&lt;a href=\"Capitol%20Limited%20%28Amtrak%29\"&gt;Capitol Limited&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Lake%20Shore%20Limited\"&gt;Lake Shore Limited&lt;/a&gt;\" routes, which stop at &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Lakefront%20Station\"&gt;Cleveland Lakefront Station&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Cleveland hosts several inter-modal freight railroad terminals, for Norfolk Southern, CSX and several smaller companies. There have been several proposals for &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20commuter%20rail\"&gt;commuter rail in Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, including a study into a Sandusky\u2013Cleveland line. Cleveland was also identified as a hub for the now-suspended &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20Hub\"&gt;Ohio Hub&lt;/a&gt; project, which would bring &lt;a href=\"high-speed%20rail\"&gt;high-speed rail&lt;/a&gt; to Ohio.\nInter-city bus lines.\nNational &lt;a href=\"intercity%20bus\"&gt;intercity bus&lt;/a&gt; service is provided at a &lt;a href=\"Greyhound%20Lines\"&gt;Greyhound&lt;/a&gt; station, just behind the Playhouse Square theater district. &lt;a href=\"Megabus%20%28North%20America%29\"&gt;Megabus&lt;/a&gt; provides service to Cleveland and has a stop at the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Transit Center on the east side of downtown. &lt;a href=\"METRO%20RTA\"&gt;Akron Metro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brunswick%20Transit%20Alternative\"&gt;Brunswick Transit Alternative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laketran\"&gt;Laketran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorain%20County%20Transit\"&gt;Lorain County Transit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Medina%20County%20Transit\"&gt;Medina County Transit&lt;/a&gt; provide connecting bus service to the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority. &lt;a href=\"Geauga%20County%20Transit\"&gt;Geauga County Transit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portage%20Area%20Regional%20Transportation%20Authority\"&gt;Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA)&lt;/a&gt; also offer connecting bus service in their neighboring areas.\nHyperloop proposal.\nOn February 15, 2018, &lt;a href=\"Hyperloop%20Transportation%20Technologies\"&gt;Hyperloop Transportation Technologies&lt;/a&gt; announced that it had signed an agreement with the North Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency and the &lt;a href=\"Illinois%20Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;Illinois Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; to conduct a feasibility study for a planned Great Lakes &lt;a href=\"Hyperloop\"&gt;Hyperloop&lt;/a&gt; system connecting Cleveland to Chicago in a half hour.\nIn June 2019, Congress approved $5\u00a0million to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;U.S. Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; to explore safety standards for this project.\nSister cities and international relations.\nAs of , Cleveland maintains cultural, economic, and educational ties with 23 &lt;a href=\"sister%20city\"&gt;sister cities&lt;/a&gt; around the world. It concluded its first sister city partnership with &lt;a href=\"Lima\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; in 1964. The Cleveland Council on World Affairs was established in 1923.
