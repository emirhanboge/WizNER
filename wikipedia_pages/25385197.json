He was selected to play for Scotland in 1911, losing all games of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;Five Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the start of the First World War, he was commissioned into the &lt;a href=\"Rifle%20Brigade%20%28Prince%20Consort%27s%20Own%29\"&gt;Rifle Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, and was eventually promoted to captain in November 1915. Soon after getting married in June 1916, his regiment participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Somme\"&gt;Battle of the Somme&lt;/a&gt;, and he was killed in action on the first day, hit by a bullet and shrapnel. He is remembered on the &lt;a href=\"Thiepval%20Memorial\"&gt;Thiepval Memorial&lt;/a&gt; to the missing of the Somme.\nEarly life.\nRowland Fraser was born in Perth, Scotland on 10 January 1890. He attended Merchiston Preparatory School from 1900 to 1903, then Merchiston Castle from 1903 to 1908, before going to &lt;a href=\"Pembroke%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Pembroke College, Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nFraser was selected to represent &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20University%20RFC\"&gt;Cambridge University&lt;/a&gt; in the Varsity Matches of 1908, &lt;a href=\"Poulton%27s%20Match\"&gt;1909&lt;/a&gt; and, as captain, 1910. The first of these was a draw, but Cambridge lost the next two.\nProvincial career.\nHe played for the &lt;a href=\"Whites%20Trial\"&gt;Whites Trial&lt;/a&gt; side against the &lt;a href=\"Blues%20Trial\"&gt;Blues Trial&lt;/a&gt; side on &lt;a href=\"1910%E2%80%9311%20Scottish%20Districts%20season\"&gt;21 January 1911&lt;/a&gt;, while still with Cambridge University.\nInternational career.\nHe was then picked to play for in 1911, playing his debut against France. Scotland lost all four games of the &lt;a href=\"1911%20Five%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;1911 Five Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt;, and was the first international side to be defeated by France. Fraser and &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Harding%20Turner\"&gt;Frederick Harding Turner&lt;/a&gt; were the only two forwards to play in all four. According to &lt;a href=\"E.%20H.%20D.%20Sewell\"&gt;E. H. D. Sewell&lt;/a&gt;, the contemporary rugby journalist, he was not to blame for his lack of wins, being a \"hard-working [forward]... a good dribbler, and a magnificent tackler.\"\nMilitary career.\nFraser was commissioned into the Rifle Brigade on 15 August 1914. He trained with the 6th Battalion at Sheerness, until he crossed to France with his unit on 4 January 1915. He was promoted to lieutenant in August 1915, and to captain in November. In June 1916, Fraser returned home on four days leave, and was married on 20 June to May Dorothy Ross of New South Wales, Australia returning the following day to France. Ten days later, Fraser was killed in action in the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916. He was leading his company in an assault on German positions, when he was hit by a machine-gun bullet. His orderly got him into a shell-hole and dressed his wound but was then struck by shrapnel.\nHe is remembered on the &lt;a href=\"Thiepval%20Memorial\"&gt;Thiepval Memorial&lt;/a&gt; to the missing of the Somme (Pier and Face 16 B and 16 C)."
