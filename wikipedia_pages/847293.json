    "text": "The Rhino Times is a &lt;a href=\"conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; news and opinion website covering &lt;a href=\"Guilford%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Guilford County, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally founded in 1991 as The Rhinoceros Times. Another print edition was founded in &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 and discontinued in 2008. The primary newspaper went into hundreds of thousands dollars of debt and ceased publication in 2013, but it was bought by local real estate developer Roy Carroll and reopened later that year. It ceased publication again in 2018, and today is an online-only newspaper.\nFeatures.\nThe newspaper features editorial columns by Greensboro-based &lt;a href=\"science%20fiction\"&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt; and fantasy author &lt;a href=\"Orson%20Scott%20Card\"&gt;Orson Scott Card&lt;/a&gt; and local &lt;a href=\"investigative%20reporting\"&gt;investigative reporting&lt;/a&gt; by \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" best-selling author &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Bledsoe\"&gt;Jerry Bledsoe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe back page of the paper features a regular commentary article by editor John Hammer, \"Under the Hammer\". In the feature, Hammer is highly critical of President &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, referring almost exclusively to him as either \"Barack Hussein Obama\" or by his last name. Hammer also promotes &lt;a href=\"conspiracy%20theories\"&gt;conspiratorial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fringe%20theories\"&gt;fringe theories&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama%20religion%20conspiracy%20theories\"&gt;Obama is a \"secret Muslim\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama%20citizenship%20conspiracy%20theories\"&gt;was not born in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nControversies.\nJyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoon.\nThe newspaper published two of the controversial &lt;a href=\"Jyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy\"&gt;Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons&lt;/a&gt; in February, 2006.\nKu Klux Klan.\nIn July 2009, the paper won a $25,000 judgement for punitive damages against an &lt;a href=\"Arkansas\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Ku%20Klux%20Klan\"&gt;Ku Klux Klan&lt;/a&gt; group and its leader &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Robb%20%28activist%29\"&gt;Thomas Robb&lt;/a&gt;. The case was filed in 2006 when the paper alleged the Klan inserted its fliers into \"Times\" newspapers, which then went to customers. The Klan counter-sued for defamation, but lost. In addition to punitive damages, the paper reportedly received the nation's first permanent injunction against the KKK, barring them from using the paper to distribute their literature in the future.\nPrisoner cartoon.\nIn June 2011, a controversy was created when the \"Rhino Times\" published a cartoon by Geof Brooks that featured two &lt;a href=\"African%20American\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; men in orange &lt;a href=\"prison%20jumpsuit\"&gt;prison jumpsuit&lt;/a&gt;s, in the front yards of what appears to be two suburban homes. The first character states, \"Geez! Dey builds a brand new jail wit' three squares [square meals] an' &lt;a href=\"cable%20television\"&gt;cable&lt;/a&gt;...\", and the second character concludes, \"And dey puts us on &lt;a href=\"house%20arrest\"&gt;house arrest&lt;/a&gt; so's dey can pays for it!\"\nEditor John Hammer apologized in the next edition of the paper, claiming that the cartoonist had intended the prisoners to be caucasian; in his apology, Hammer did not address why the cartoon had been colorized as it was, nor the failure of the editors to catch the mistake. The \"&lt;a href=\"Greensboro%20News%20%26amp%3B%20Record\"&gt;Greensboro News &amp; Record&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that Hammer called Guilford County Commissioners Chairman &lt;a href=\"Melvin%20%26quot%3BSkip%26quot%3B%20Alston\"&gt;Melvin \"Skip\" Alston&lt;/a&gt; to apologize for the cartoon. Alston commented that he felt the cartoonist \"might have had some racial intent\".\nPhotography arrest story.\nIn January 2015, Editor John Hammer published a story claiming two Irish tourists were accosted, treated roughly and arrested by Greensboro police while trying to take photos in the city's Bicentennial Garden. The story, including interviews with the couple and details of their arrest, was a fabrication. In response to controversy over the story, Hammer claimed the piece was intended as satire, though the publication did not in any way label it as such. In the next week's issue, Hammer apologized to readers for not clearly marking the piece as satire and \"to the police for maligning them.\""
