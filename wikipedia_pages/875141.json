    "text": "Dolma is a family of stuffed dishes from &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20cuisine\"&gt;Ottoman cuisine&lt;/a&gt; that can be served warm or cold. Some types of dolma are made with whole vegetables, fruit, offal or seafood, while others are made by wrapping leaves, most commonly grape or cabbage leaves, around the filling. Wrapped dolma, specifically, are also known as \"&lt;a href=\"sarma%20%28food%29\"&gt;sarma&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHistory.\nStuffed vegetable dishes have been a part of &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Eastern%20cuisine\"&gt;Middle Eastern cuisine&lt;/a&gt; for centuries. Recipes for stuffed eggplant have been found in &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20literature%23Culinary\"&gt;Medieval Arabic cookbooks&lt;/a&gt; and, in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek%20cuisine\"&gt;Ancient Greek cuisine&lt;/a&gt;, fig leaves stuffed with sweetened cheese were called .\nThe Iranian variety has been traced to at least the 17th-century. During the 19th-century several varieties were recorded by &lt;a href=\"Naser%20al-Din%20Shah%20Qajar\"&gt;Naser al-Din Shah Qajar&lt;/a&gt;'s chef, including stuffed vine leaves, cabbage leaves, &lt;a href=\"cucumber\"&gt;cucumber&lt;/a&gt;s, eggplants, &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"quince\"&gt;quince&lt;/a&gt;s, with varied fillings prepared with ground meat, sauteed mint leaves, rice and &lt;a href=\"saffron\"&gt;saffron&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Cabbage%20rolls\"&gt;Cabbage rolls&lt;/a&gt; entered &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20cuisine\"&gt;Swedish cuisine&lt;/a&gt; (where they are known as \"k\u00e5ldolmar\") after &lt;a href=\"Charles%20XII\"&gt;Charles XII&lt;/a&gt;, defeated by the Russians at the &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Poltava\"&gt;battle of Poltava&lt;/a&gt;, returned to Sweden in 1715 with his Turkish creditors and their cooks.\nIn 2017, dolma making in &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; was included in the &lt;a href=\"UNESCO%20Intangible%20Cultural%20Heritage%20Lists\"&gt;UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistribution.\nDolma dishes are found in &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20cuisine\"&gt;Balkan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caucasian%20cuisine\"&gt;Caucasian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arab%20cuisine\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Persian%20cuisine\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Israeli%20cuisine\"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20cuisine\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20cuisine\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asian%20cuisine\"&gt;Central Asian cuisine&lt;/a&gt;. The word dolma, of &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; origin, means \"something stuffed\". In some of the former Ottoman countries the native names have been retained or have blended with Turkish language terms, for example, in Kuwait and Damascus, stuffed leaves are called \"mahshi yabraq\" or \"mahshi brag\", a combination of the Turkish word for leaf (\"yaprak\") and the &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; term for stuffed (\"mahshi\"). Dolma are part of &lt;a href=\"cuisine%20of%20the%20Sephardic%20Jews\"&gt;cuisine of the Sephardic Jews&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Jews in the Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; used locally grown grape leaves and adopted the Turkish name of the dish.\nDuring winter months cabbage was a staple food for peasants in Persia and the Ottoman Empire, and it spread to the Balkans as well. Jews in Eastern Europe prepared variations of stuffed cabbage rolls with &lt;a href=\"kosher\"&gt;kosher&lt;/a&gt; meat\u2014this dish is called \"golubtsy\" in Russian, \"holubtsi\" in Ukrainian, \"&lt;a href=\"go%C5%82%C4%85bki\"&gt;go\u0142\u0105bki&lt;/a&gt;\" in Polish and \"&lt;a href=\"holishkes\"&gt;holishkes&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"teibel\" in Yiddish. As meat was expensive, rice was sometimes mixed in with the meat. Jews in Europe would sometimes substitute &lt;a href=\"barley\"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt;, bread or &lt;a href=\"kasha\"&gt;kasha&lt;/a&gt; for the rice.\nSyrians, Lebanese, Iraqis and Iranians have been making stuffed vine leaves for centuries, which predates the Ottoman empire. Over time, regional variations developed. It includes a version of stuffed cabbage leaves, onions and aubergines cooked in tomato sauce. &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Iraq\"&gt;Iraqi Jewish&lt;/a&gt; families had a version of dolma with sweet and sour flavors that were not found in other versions. \nIn the Persian Gulf, &lt;a href=\"basmati\"&gt;basmati&lt;/a&gt; rice is preferred, and the flavor of the stuffing may be enhanced using tomatoes, onions and &lt;a href=\"cumin\"&gt;cumin&lt;/a&gt;. Muslim families often serve dolma as part of the \"&lt;a href=\"iftar\"&gt;iftar&lt;/a&gt;\" meal during &lt;a href=\"Ramadan\"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt; and during the &lt;a href=\"Eid%20al-Fitr\"&gt;Eid al-Fitr&lt;/a&gt; celebrations that mark the end of the holy month. &lt;a href=\"Assyrian%20people\"&gt;Assyrians&lt;/a&gt; prepare meatless dolmas for &lt;a href=\"Lent\"&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt;. Large pots of dolma are prepared during the &lt;a href=\"Nowruz\"&gt;Novruz&lt;/a&gt; festival. When traditional ingredients are not available the Armenian Christian community in &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt; celebrates &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; with \"&lt;a href=\"Trichosanthes%20dioica\"&gt;potoler dorma&lt;/a&gt;\", a local variation from &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Indian%20cuisine\"&gt;Anglo-Indian cuisine&lt;/a&gt;. Stuffed vegetables called \"gemista\" or \"tsounidis\" are also common in &lt;a href=\"Greek%20cuisine\"&gt;Greek cuisine&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariants.\nThere are many varieties of the \"zeytinya\u011fl\u0131\" (with olive oil) and \"sa\u011fya\u011fl\u0131\" (with clarified butter) \"dolmas\". The \"zeytinya\u011fl\u0131\" dolmas are usually stuffed with rice and served cold with a garlic-yogurt sauce, but variations with meat based fillings are served warm, often with &lt;a href=\"tahini\"&gt;tahini&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"avgolemono%20sauce\"&gt;avgolemono sauce&lt;/a&gt;.\nStuffed vine leaves.\nThe origins of stuffed vine leaves are unknown. They are known as \"dolme\" in Iran, \"dolmades\" in Greece, \"tolma\" in Armenia, and \"yebra\" in Syria. Some &lt;a href=\"Israelis\"&gt;Israelis&lt;/a&gt; may use leaves picked from the local &lt;a href=\"mulberry%20trees\"&gt;mulberry trees&lt;/a&gt;.\nStuffed vine leaves without meat are sometimes called \"yalanc\u0131 dolma\", which means \"fake dolma\" in Turkish. \"Vi\u015fneli yalanc\u0131 dolmas\u0131\" is a variation of stuffed vine leaves where the rice is seasoned with &lt;a href=\"cinnamon\"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"allspice\"&gt;allspice&lt;/a&gt; and mint. The dolmas are slowly cooked together with &lt;a href=\"morello%20cherries\"&gt;morello cherries&lt;/a&gt; (\"vi\u015fne\"), and &lt;a href=\"plums\"&gt;plums&lt;/a&gt; may be used also. An &lt;a href=\"Israeli%20cuisine\"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; recipe has a meat-filled variant served in a pomegranate sauce with dried cherries.\nEgyptians call this main course &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20cuisine%23Main%20courses\"&gt;mahshi&lt;/a&gt; (also spelled mashi or mashy). It is stuffed vine leaves but traditionally, cabbage is used in the winter and vine leaves are used in the summer.\nCabbage rolls.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Persian%20cuisine\"&gt;Persian cuisine&lt;/a&gt; is a dish of cabbage rolls stuffed with beans and tart fruits. It is wrapped with cabbage leaves, and stuffed with red beans, garbanzo beans, lentils, cracked wheat, tomato paste, onion and many spices and flavorings. Cabbage rolls are called Pasuts tolma (\u057a\u0561\u057d\u0578\u0582\u0581 \u057f\u0578\u056c\u0574\u0561) (Lenten dolma) in &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20language\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; where they are of seven different grains \u2013 chickpea, bean, lentil, cracked wheat, pea, rice and maize. Armenian cooks sometimes use &lt;a href=\"rose%20hip\"&gt;rose hip&lt;/a&gt; syrup to flavor stuffed cabbage rolls. Some Jewish families eat stuffed cabbage on \"&lt;a href=\"Simchat%20Torah\"&gt;Simchat Torah&lt;/a&gt;\". There is a Turkish variation with a &lt;a href=\"chestnut\"&gt;chestnut&lt;/a&gt;-and-rice-based filling.\nVegetables.\n\"M\u00fclebbes dolma\" is a historic recipe from the Ottoman era. \"Halep dolmas\u0131\"\u2014named for &lt;a href=\"Aleppo\"&gt;Aleppo&lt;/a&gt;\u2014is a dish of eggplants stuffed with a meat and rice filling that is flavored with spices and either sour plum flavoring syrup or lemon juice. \"\u015ealgam dolma\" are stuffed Russian turnips.\n \"So\u011fan dolmas\u0131\" (\"so\u011fan\" meaning \"onion\" in Turkish), or stuffed onions, are a traditional dish in &lt;a href=\"Bosnia\"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt;, considered the specialty of &lt;a href=\"Mostar\"&gt;Mostar&lt;/a&gt;. Ingredients include onions, &lt;a href=\"minced%20beef\"&gt;minced beef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tomato%20pur%C3%A9e\"&gt;tomato pur\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"paprika\"&gt;paprika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vinegar\"&gt;vinegar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sour%20cream\"&gt;sour cream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"strained%20yogurt\"&gt;strained yogurt&lt;/a&gt; (locally known as \"kiselo mlijeko\", literally \"sour milk\"), &lt;a href=\"black%20pepper\"&gt;black pepper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salt\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spices\"&gt;spices&lt;/a&gt;. After the onion's skin is removed, the larger, external, layers (leaves) of onion bulbs are used as containers, so-called \"shirts\" (&lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Turkish%20language\"&gt;Old Turk.&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Adolm%C3%A1ny\"&gt;dolama(n)&lt;/a&gt;\" for a &lt;a href=\"Dolman\"&gt;special kind&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Turks\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; robe) for the meat stuffing. The remaining part of the onion is also used, mixed with the meat and fried on oil for a couple of minutes, to obtain the base of the stuffing. To extract the separate \"shirts\", the entire bulbs are cut on the top and then boiled until soft enough to be pried off, layer by layer. In order to prevent a further softening and crumbling, the bulbs should be &lt;a href=\"blanching%20%28cooking%29\"&gt;blanched&lt;/a&gt;. The \"shirts\" are removed from the bulbs by slow and gentle finger pressure. Filled \"shirts\" (\"dolme\") are boiled slowly at low heat in &lt;a href=\"broth\"&gt;broth&lt;/a&gt;. The level of liquid should be sufficient to cover the dolmas entirely. Sogan-dolma are usually served with dense natural yogurt.\n\"Enginar dolmas\u0131\" is stuffed whole artichoke hearts. They may be stuffed with seasoned rice or ground meat cooked in fresh tomato sauce with &lt;a href=\"aleppo%20pepper\"&gt;aleppo pepper&lt;/a&gt;.

The remainder of the rice is used to fill eggplant, zucchini, and stuffing peppers. The wrapped onion dolma are added on the bottom of a deep cooking pot and the stuffed vegetables, cabbage rolls, and stuffed vine leaves are layered on top of the onion dolmas. The entire pot of dolmas are cooked in sumac flavored water.\nSeafood.\nThere are also seafood variants of dolma.

Midye dolma may be filled with rice, onion, black pepper and pimento spice.\nThe filling for \"kalamar dolma\" (stuffed &lt;a href=\"calamari\"&gt;calamari&lt;/a&gt;) is made from &lt;a href=\"Halloumi\"&gt;Halloumi&lt;/a&gt; cheese, onion, fresh bread crumbs, garlic and parsley. The whole tentacle is stuffed with the mixture and fried in a butter, olive oil and tomato sauce. For another variation a whole small squid may be stuffed with a bulgur and fresh herb mixture and baked in the oven.\n\"Uskumru dolma\" (stuffed &lt;a href=\"mackerel\"&gt;mackerel&lt;/a&gt;) is a staple of Istanbul cuisine. The version that was traditionally prepared by Armenian cooks is particularly well-regarded. After the fish is prepared by carefully separating the skin from the meat, the meat is sauteed with onions, currants, dried &lt;a href=\"apricots\"&gt;apricots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"almonds\"&gt;almonds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hazelnuts\"&gt;hazelnuts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pine%20nuts\"&gt;pine nuts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"walnuts\"&gt;walnuts&lt;/a&gt;, cinnamon, &lt;a href=\"cloves\"&gt;cloves&lt;/a&gt;, allspice, &lt;a href=\"ginger\"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt;, fresh herbs and lemon juice. The entire mixture is stuffed into the whole, intact skin. The stuffed mackerel is then either baked or preferably grilled long enough to brown the skin.\n&lt;a href=\"Sardine\"&gt;Sardine&lt;/a&gt;s (\"sardalya\") may be stuffed with a filling of kashar cheese, tomato, onion, dill and parsley. In Turkey, stuffed sardines may be served as a mezze platter at traditional taverns called \"&lt;a href=\"meyhane\"&gt;meyhane&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOffal.\nThere are several varieties of dolma made with &lt;a href=\"offal\"&gt;offal&lt;/a&gt;. \"Dalak dolmas\u0131\", widely considered a delicacy of Armenian origin, is &lt;a href=\"spleen\"&gt;spleen&lt;/a&gt; stuffed with rice that has been seasoned with allspice, salt, pepper, mint, parsley and onion.

First black grapes are boiled together with &lt;a href=\"sumac\"&gt;sumac&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the resulting sumac flavored grape juice is drained and reserved. The \"ku\u015fba\u015f\u0131\" lamb is cooked in this sumac flavored grape juice. The apples are stuffed with a mixture of ground lamb combined with rice, salt, pepper and layered in a pot on top of the cooked chunks of \"ku\u015fba\u015f\u0131\". The apples are cooked in the remaining sumac flavored grape juice. Dried apricots and blanched almonds are added to the pot near the end of the cooking process. A meatless variant of the filling is made from a sauteed mixture of diced apples, diced pears, walnuts, hazelnut, currants, cinnamon, cloves, and &lt;a href=\"star%20anise\"&gt;star anise&lt;/a&gt;. The hollowed out apples are stuffed with the mixture and baked in the oven. This version may be garnished with powdered sugar.\nStuffed melons were part of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20palace%20cuisine\"&gt;Ottoman palace cuisine&lt;/a&gt;. The recipe survives in modern Yemenite and Armenian cooking."
