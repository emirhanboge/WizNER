    "text": "The Dunvegan Cup is a wooden ceremonial cup, decorated with silver plates, which dates to 1493. It was created at the request of Caitr\u00edona, wife of John Maguire, &lt;a href=\"Maguire%20of%20Fermanagh\"&gt;lord of Fermanagh&lt;/a&gt;. The cup is an &lt;a href=\"heirloom\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20MacLeod\"&gt;Macleods&lt;/a&gt; of Dunvegan, and is held at their &lt;a href=\"Family%20seat\"&gt;seat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dunvegan%20Castle\"&gt;Dunvegan Castle&lt;/a&gt;. There are several traditions attributed to the cup, describing how the Macleods obtained it. However, it is thought more likely that the cup passed into the possession of the clan sometime in the 16th or 17th centuries. The Macleod chiefs have several other notable heirlooms kept at Dunvegan Castle, such as the &lt;a href=\"Fairy%20Flag\"&gt;Fairy Flag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Rory%20Mor%27s%20Horn\"&gt;Sir Rory Mor's Horn&lt;/a&gt; (\"all three pictured right\").\nDescription.\nThe Dunvegan Cup is a wooden ceremonial cup, made of wood and elaborately decorated with silver. It is square shaped at the top and rounded at the bottom, and stands on four legs. Sir &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Scott\"&gt;Walter Scott&lt;/a&gt; examined the cup and, in 1815 in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Isles\"&gt;The Lord of the Isles&lt;/a&gt;\", gave its measurements as: in height on the outside, in depth in the inside, the extreme breadth over the mouth. In around the 1850s, Alexander Nesbitt gave similar measurements, and added that it was at the broadest point of the cup, which is somewhat below the middle.\nThe cup is constructed mostly of wood. Scott thought it was possibly &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;, and later Nesbitt considered it to be either &lt;a href=\"Taxus\"&gt;yew&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"alder\"&gt;alder&lt;/a&gt;. The cup is covered with mountings of silver, wrought in &lt;a href=\"filigree\"&gt;filigree&lt;/a&gt; and decorated with &lt;a href=\"niello\"&gt;niello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gilding\"&gt;gilding&lt;/a&gt;. The mouth of the cup has a rim of solid &lt;a href=\"silver-gilt\"&gt;silver-gilt&lt;/a&gt;, in depth. On the outside of the rim is an engraved inscription in black lettering in two lines. The spaces between the letters are &lt;a href=\"Hatching\"&gt;hatched&lt;/a&gt; with fine lines, which intersect diagonally. The angels of the rim have strips ornamented with &lt;a href=\"niello\"&gt;niello&lt;/a&gt;. The inside of the rim is plain by comparison; except for the letter \"I.H.S.\" repeated on all four sides. Each side of the cup has its own designs of triangles and circles. R.C. MacLeod considered these to be representations of the &lt;a href=\"Trinity\"&gt;Trinity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eternity\"&gt;Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Ian Finlay described the circled, six-pointed stars as not unlike those on the outer-side of the &lt;a href=\"Domnach%20Airgid\"&gt;Domnach Airgid&lt;/a&gt;, which is held in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;National Museum of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. Empty sockets on the outside of the cup are thought to have once held stones, or glass. Several somewhat smaller sockets hold beads of &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt;. The silver legs are in the form of human legs; and are ornamented with a twisted wire which runs down the front. The feet have shoes, which are covered in niello, the legs being gilt. Everywhere except the rim, the silver is very thin, and in consequence has suffered a great deal of damage over the years. The cup has been classified as a \"&lt;a href=\"mether\"&gt;mether&lt;/a&gt;\", a communal drinking cup used at ceremonial events, as it is square-shaped at the top and rounded at the bottom.\nHistory.\nEarliest references to the cup.\nAccording to F.T. MacLeod, the first published accounts of the cup were made by Sir &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Scott\"&gt;Walter Scott&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Wilson%20%28academic%29\"&gt;Sir Daniel Wilson&lt;/a&gt; in the early 19th centuries. F.T. MacLeod noted that three earlier visitors to Dunvegan Castle\u2014&lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Johnson\"&gt;Samuel Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20Boswell\"&gt;James Boswell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Pennant\"&gt;Thomas Pennant&lt;/a&gt;\u2014made no mention of having seen the cup. Scott mentioned the cup within the explanatory note on the following lines, in \"The Lord of the Isles\".\nDiffering transcriptions.\nScott attempted to transcribe the Latin inscription on the silver rim of the cup. His early attempt at transcribing the inscription differs significantly from later attempts by others. Scott's transcription and translation is as follows.\nScott's rendering of the cup's inscription made him believe that it was a &lt;a href=\"Hebrides\"&gt;Hebridean&lt;/a&gt; drinking cup, dating from the year 993. Scott also declared that Macleod tradition had it that the cup had once belonged to \"Neil Ghlune-Dhu, or Black-knee. But who this Neil was, no one pretends to say\". In about 1851, &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Wilson%20%28academic%29\"&gt;Sir Daniel Wilson&lt;/a&gt; documented the cup in his \"The Archaeology and Prehistoric Annals of Scotland\", following along the same lines as Scott. Wilson made only a few minor edits to Scott's rendering of the Latin inscription, but at the time he had not seen the cup. After certain correspondence and the aid of &lt;a href=\"William%20Forbes%20Skene\"&gt;William Forbes Skene&lt;/a&gt;, Wilson was able to examine the cup in person and later amended his analysis. His subsequent rendering of the inscription was vastly different from Scott's, and Wilson concluded that the cup was a product of Irish craftsmanship, rather than of Scottish origin. Wilson's new rendering of the inscription had the cup belonging to a \"Katharina nig Ryneill\"; and he considered that the John, son of the Maguire, who was mentioned in the transcription, was the same as the one mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Annals%20of%20the%20Four%20Masters\"&gt;Annals of the Four Masters&lt;/a&gt; in the year 1484. Wilson stated that this John died in 1511, and that his wife was unknown; but that a Catherine, who was the daughter of MacRannal, was married to a Maguire, and her death is mentioned in the year 1490.\nAt about the same time, &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20O%27Curry\"&gt;Eugene O'Curry&lt;/a&gt;, of the Brehon Law Commission, examined the cup and transcribed the inscription. Alexander Nesbitt noted O'Curry's transcription and pointed out that the last part of the inscription was from the fifteenth verse of the 145th &lt;a href=\"Psalm\"&gt;Psalm&lt;/a&gt;. O'Curry's rendering of the woman's name was \"Katherina ingen ui Neill\"\u2014making her an O'Neill, rather than a MacRannal. Nesbitt noted that John Maguire is recorded several times in the Annals of the Four Masters; and that he became one of the chiefs of the Maguires in 1484. Nesbitt stated that John Maguire died in 1503; and that he could not find the Katharine O'Neill, within the annals.\nLater, Roderick Charles MacLeod transcribed the inscription; giving the woman's name as \"Katharina Nig Ry Neil\"\u2014Katharina, daughter of King Neil. R.C. MacLeod declared that Macleod legend assigned the cup to &lt;a href=\"Niall%20Gl%C3%BAndub\"&gt;Niall Gl\u00fandub&lt;/a&gt;, and that the cup might have passed down to her from him, or that the cup was attributed to him by his descendants. R.C. MacLeod later claimed that it was traditionally given that the wooden bowl dated from the 10th century, and that it was the property of Niall Gl\u00fandub, the 10th century Irish king of &lt;a href=\"Cen%C3%A9l%20nE%C3%B3gain\"&gt;Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain&lt;/a&gt;, R.C. MacLeod does not rule out the possibility of the ornamentation having been added to the cup at a later date; the silver work dates, at the earliest, from the 14th century and the dated inscription puts it at 1493.\nFrom Ireland to Scotland and the Macleods.\nIn about 1913, Fred T. MacLeod stated that he could find no reference to the cup in the Dunvegan records. He continued, that Macleod tradition was that it came into the possession of the Macleods through the fairies, of which there are one or two legends.\nF.T. MacLeod stated that it is impossible to determine exactly when the cup passed into the hands of the Macleods of Dunvegan. However, he thought it likely that the cup entered into the possession of the clan in the 16th or 17th centuries. During this era several Macleod chiefs took part in warring in Ireland. He considered it likely that the cup may have been a prize of war, or a gift for services. Later, R.C. MacLeod stated that a Lady O'Neill claimed in 1925 letter, that an O'Neill tradition told how the cup passed into the hands of the Macleods. The tradition runs that one of their chiefs was a close friend of a Macleod chief. When this O'Neill chief visited his friend at Dunvegan he took with him the cup and gave it to Macleod as a present.\nHistorically, during the 1590s, a Macleod chief lent support to certain Irish forces rebelling against those supporting &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I\"&gt;Elizabeth I&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland. In the summer of 1594, D\u00f2mhnall Gorm M\u00f2r MacDh\u00f2mhnaill (chief of the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Macdonald%20of%20Sleat\"&gt;Macdonalds of Sleat&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Roderick%20Macleod%20of%20Macleod%2C%2015th%20Chief\"&gt;Ruairidh M\u00f2r MacLe\u00f2id&lt;/a&gt; (chief of the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20MacLeod\"&gt;Macleods of Harris and Dunvegan&lt;/a&gt;) both sailed for &lt;a href=\"Ulster\"&gt;Ulster&lt;/a&gt; at the head of 500 men each. Their force was intended to support &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Roe%20%C3%93%20Donnell\"&gt;Aodh Ruadh \u00d3 Domhnaill&lt;/a&gt; who was &lt;a href=\"Siege\"&gt;besieging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enniskillen%20Castle\"&gt;Enniskillen Castle&lt;/a&gt;. After landing at Loch Foyle, the Hebridean chieftains were entertained by \u00d3 Domhnaill for three days and three nights. MacDh\u00f2mhnaill then returned to the Hebrides and left his men behind in Ireland, however, MacLe\u00f2id stayed and was present at the fall of Enniskillen Castle in October 1594. He was still in Ireland the next year at the head of 600 Hebrideans, alongside \u00d3 Domhnaill at the siege of MacCostello's Castle, in &lt;a href=\"County%20Mayo\"&gt;County Mayo&lt;/a&gt;. In light of Ruairidh M\u00f2r's participation in activities in Ireland at the end of the 16th century, R.C. MacLeod concluded that the cup passed into the hands of the Macleods through the O'Neill chieftain &lt;a href=\"Shane%20%C3%93%20Neill\"&gt;Shane \u00d3 Neill&lt;/a&gt;; and that the two chieftains were the friends mentioned in the traditional tale related by Lady O'Neill in 1925.\nTraditions.\nIn 1927, R.C. MacLeod gave two abridged versions of traditions said to be attributed to the Dunvegan Cup, although it was R.C. MacLeod's opinion that these traditions were un-historical. The traditions are supposed to relate events which took place during the tenure of Malcolm, the third chief of Clan Macleod, who lived about 1296\u20131370.\nThe second story also mentions the two brothers, but differs in all other details. It relates how the chief held a great banquet at Rowdell in &lt;a href=\"Harris%2C%20Outer%20Hebrides\"&gt;Harris&lt;/a&gt;."
