    "text": "Lufthansa () is the flag carrier and largest airline of &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; which, when combined with its subsidiaries, is the second-&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20largest%20airlines%20in%20Europe\"&gt;largest airline in Europe&lt;/a&gt; in terms of passengers carried. The name of the former &lt;a href=\"flag%20carrier\"&gt;flag carrier&lt;/a&gt; is derived from the German word \"Luft\" meaning \"air\" and \"Hansa\" for the &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20League\"&gt;Hanseatic League&lt;/a&gt;. Lufthansa is one of the five founding members of &lt;a href=\"Star%20Alliance\"&gt;Star Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the world's largest &lt;a href=\"airline%20alliance\"&gt;airline alliance&lt;/a&gt;, formed in 1997. The company slogan is 'Say yes to the world.'\nBesides its own services, and owning subsidiary passenger airlines &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Airlines\"&gt;Austrian Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20International%20Air%20Lines\"&gt;Swiss International Air Lines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Airlines\"&gt;Brussels Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eurowings\"&gt;Eurowings&lt;/a&gt; (referred to in English by Lufthansa as its \"Passenger Airline Group\"), Deutsche Lufthansa AG owns several aviation-related companies, such as &lt;a href=\"Lufthansa%20Technik\"&gt;Lufthansa Technik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"LSG%20Sky%20Chefs\"&gt;LSG Sky Chefs&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Lufthansa%20Group\"&gt;Lufthansa Group&lt;/a&gt;. In total, the group has over 700 aircraft, making it one of the &lt;a href=\"World%27s%20largest%20airlines%23By%20fleet%20size\"&gt;largest airline fleets in the world&lt;/a&gt;.\nLufthansa's &lt;a href=\"registered%20office\"&gt;registered office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"corporate%20headquarters\"&gt;corporate headquarters&lt;/a&gt; are in &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;. The main operations base, called Lufthansa Aviation Center, is at Lufthansa's primary hub at &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20Airport\"&gt;Frankfurt Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and its secondary hub is at &lt;a href=\"Munich%20Airport\"&gt;Munich Airport&lt;/a&gt; where a secondary \"Flight Operations Centre\" is maintained.\nHistory.\n1950s: Post-war (re-)formation.\nLufthansa traces its history to 1926 when &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Luft%20Hansa\"&gt;Deutsche Luft Hansa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aktiengesellschaft\"&gt;A.G.&lt;/a&gt; (styled as \"Deutsche Lufthansa\" from 1933 onwards) was formed in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. DLH, as it was known, was Germany's &lt;a href=\"flag%20carrier\"&gt;flag carrier&lt;/a&gt; until 1945 when all services were terminated following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;; it has since been demonstrated that Deutsche Luft Hansa relied on the use of forced labor and housed forced laborers on the site of Tempelhof airport. In an effort to create a new national airline, a company called Aktiengesellschaft f\u00fcr Luftverkehrsbedarf (Luftag), was founded in &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt; on 6 January 1953, with many of its staff having worked for the pre-war Lufthansa; this included Kurt Weigelt, a Nazi convicted of war crimes, who served on the board on the new Lufthansa, and Kurt Knipfer, a member of the Nazi party from 1929 who led Luft Hansa from 1933 to 1945.\n&lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt; had not yet been granted sovereignty over its airspace, so it was not known when the new airline could become operational. Nevertheless, in 1953 Luftag placed orders for four &lt;a href=\"Convair%20CV-340\"&gt;Convair CV-340&lt;/a&gt;s and four &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20L-1049%20Super%20Constellation\"&gt;Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation&lt;/a&gt;s and set up a maintenance base at &lt;a href=\"Hamburg%20Airport\"&gt;Hamburg Airport&lt;/a&gt;. On 6 August 1954, Luftag acquired the name and logo of the liquidated Deutsche Lufthansa for &lt;a href=\"German%20Mark\"&gt;DM&lt;/a&gt; 30,000 (equivalent to \u20ac today), thus continuing the tradition of a German flag carrier of that name.\nOn 1 April 1955 Lufthansa won approval to start scheduled domestic flights, linking &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D%C3%BCsseldorf\"&gt;D\u00fcsseldorf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;. International flights started on 15 May 1955, to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Super%20Constellation\"&gt;Super Constellation&lt;/a&gt; flights to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; from 1 June of that year, and across the South Atlantic from August 1956. In August 1958 fifteen Lufthansa 1049Gs and 1649s left Germany each week to Canada and the United States, three 1049Gs a week flew to South America, three flew to Tehran and one to Baghdad. In parallel, the airline also initiated a marketing campaign to sell itself and West Germany. The challenges involved encouraging travelers to consider visiting the country in the wake of World War II, as well as offering services to other nations via the Frankfurt airport hub. More specifically, Lufthansa's efforts shaped and reflected the development of a modern form of consumerism and advertising through the sale of air travel. By 1963, the airline, initially limited in its public relations efforts, had become a major purveyor of West Germany's image abroad.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Soviet%20Zone\"&gt;special status&lt;/a&gt; of Berlin meant that Lufthansa was not allowed to fly to either part of &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt; in 1990. Originally thought to be only a temporary matter (and with intentions to move the airline's headquarters and main base there once the political situation changed), the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Germany%20%281945%E2%80%9390%29\"&gt;Division of Germany&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be longer than expected, which gradually led to &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20Airport\"&gt;Frankfurt Airport&lt;/a&gt; becoming Lufthansa's primary &lt;a href=\"airline%20hub\"&gt;hub&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt; tried to establish &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Lufthansa%20%28East%20Germany%29\"&gt;its airline&lt;/a&gt; in 1955 using the \"Lufthansa\" name, but this resulted in a legal dispute with &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt;, where Lufthansa was operating. East Germany instead established &lt;a href=\"Interflug\"&gt;Interflug&lt;/a&gt; as its national airline in 1963, which coincided with the East German Lufthansa being shut down.\n1960s: Introduction of jetliners.\nIn 1958 Lufthansa ordered four &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20707\"&gt;Boeing 707&lt;/a&gt;s and started jet flights from &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; to New York City in March 1960. &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20720\"&gt;Boeing 720&lt;/a&gt;Bs were later bought to back up the 707 fleets. In February 1961 Far East routes were extended beyond &lt;a href=\"Bangkok\"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, Thailand, to Hong Kong and Tokyo. &lt;a href=\"Lagos\"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt;, Nigeria, and &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg\"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;, South Africa were added in 1962.\nLufthansa introduced the &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20727\"&gt;Boeing 727&lt;/a&gt; in 1964 and that May began the &lt;a href=\"Polar%20route\"&gt;Polar route&lt;/a&gt; from Frankfurt to Tokyo via Anchorage. In February 1965 the company ordered twenty-one &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20737\"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt;s that went into service in 1968. Lufthansa was the first customer for the Boeing 737 and was one of four buyers of the 737-100s (the others were &lt;a href=\"NASA\"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malaysia-Singapore%20Airlines\"&gt;Malaysia-Singapore Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Avianca\"&gt;Avianca&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 while the NASA airframe was the first built, it was the last delivered and originally intended for delivery to Lufthansa). Lufthansa was the first foreign launch customer for a Boeing airliner.\n1970s\u20131980s: The wide-body era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"wide-body\"&gt;wide-body&lt;/a&gt; era for Lufthansa started with a &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20747\"&gt;Boeing 747&lt;/a&gt; flight on 26 April 1970. It was followed by the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"McDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-10\"&gt;DC-10-30&lt;/a&gt; on 12 November 1973, and the first &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A300\"&gt;Airbus A300&lt;/a&gt; in 1976. In 1979 Lufthansa and &lt;a href=\"Swissair\"&gt;Swissair&lt;/a&gt; became launch customers for the &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A310\"&gt;Airbus A310&lt;/a&gt; with an order for twenty-five aircraft.\nThe company's fleet modernization programme for the 1990s began on 29 June 1985, with an order for fifteen &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A320%20family\"&gt;Airbus A320s&lt;/a&gt; and seven &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A300\"&gt;Airbus A300-600s&lt;/a&gt;. Ten &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20737%20Classic\"&gt;Boeing 737-300s&lt;/a&gt; were ordered a few days later. All were delivered between 1987 and 1992. Lufthansa also bought &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A321\"&gt;Airbus A321&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A340\"&gt;Airbus A340&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20747-400\"&gt;Boeing 747-400&lt;/a&gt; aircraft.\nIn 1987 Lufthansa, together with &lt;a href=\"Air%20France\"&gt;Air France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iberia%20%28airline%29\"&gt;Iberia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Scandinavian%20Airlines\"&gt;Scandinavian Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, founded &lt;a href=\"Amadeus%20IT%20Group\"&gt;Amadeus&lt;/a&gt;, an IT company (also known as a &lt;a href=\"Computer%20reservations%20system\"&gt;GDS&lt;/a&gt;) that would enable travel agencies to sell the founders and other airlines' products from a single system.\nLufthansa adopted a new corporate identity in 1988. The fleet was given a new livery, while cabins, city offices, and airport lounges were redesigned.\n1990s\u20132000s: Further expansion.\nOn 28 October 1990, 25 days after &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;reunification&lt;/a&gt;, Berlin became a Lufthansa destination again. On 18 May 1997, Lufthansa, &lt;a href=\"Air%20Canada\"&gt;Air Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scandinavian%20Airlines\"&gt;Scandinavian Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thai%20Airways%20International\"&gt;Thai Airways International&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"United%20Airlines\"&gt;United Airlines&lt;/a&gt; formed &lt;a href=\"Star%20Alliance\"&gt;Star Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the world's first multilateral &lt;a href=\"airline%20alliance\"&gt;airline alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1999, Lufthansa participated in the German Business Foundation initiative addressing class action lawsuits against German companies for World War II-era misdeeds, including the use of forced labor, by reportedly paying 10s of millions German marks. The same year, Lufthansa commissioned the scholar Lutz Budrass to investigate the use of forced labor by its predecessor company, Deutsche Luft Hansa, during World War II; it declined to publish Dr. Budrass's resulting study for more than a decade.\nIn 2000, &lt;a href=\"Air%20One\"&gt;Air One&lt;/a&gt; became a Lufthansa partner airline and nearly all Air One flights were code-shared with Lufthansa until &lt;a href=\"Alitalia\"&gt;Alitalia&lt;/a&gt; purchased Air One. Lufthansa has a good track record for posting profits, even in 2001, after &lt;a href=\"September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks\"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt;, the airline suffered a significant loss in profits but still managed to stay 'in the black'. While many other airlines announced layoffs (typically 20% of their workforce), Lufthansa retained its current workforce.\nOn 6 December 2001, Lufthansa announced an order for 15 &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A380\"&gt;Airbus A380&lt;/a&gt; superjumbos with 10 more options, which was confirmed on 20 December. The A380 fleet would be used for long-haul flights from Frankfurt exclusively.\nIn June 2003, Lufthansa opened Terminal 2 at &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Josef%20Strau%C3%9F%20Airport\"&gt;Franz Josef Strau\u00df Airport&lt;/a&gt; to relieve its main hub, &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, which was suffering from capacity constraints. It is one of the first &lt;a href=\"airport%20terminal\"&gt;terminals&lt;/a&gt; in Europe partially owned by an airline.\nOn 17 May 2004, Lufthansa became the launch customer for the &lt;a href=\"Connexion%20by%20Boeing\"&gt;Connexion by Boeing&lt;/a&gt; in-flight online connectivity service.\nIn autumn 2003, the implementation of a new sales strategy initiated by then-incumbent &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Vice%20President\"&gt;Executive Vice President&lt;/a&gt; Thierry Antinori to make the company fit for the digital era led to the abolition of commission payments for &lt;a href=\"travel%20agencies\"&gt;travel agencies&lt;/a&gt; and led to a revolution in the German travel business with many travel agencies disappearing from the market on the one hand, and the rise of new &lt;a href=\"Digital%20data\"&gt;digital&lt;/a&gt; distribution platforms on the other hand.\nOn 22 March 2005, &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20International%20Air%20Lines\"&gt;Swiss International Air Lines&lt;/a&gt; was purchased by Lufthansa's holding company. The acquisition included the provision that the majority shareholders (the &lt;a href=\"Politics%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;Swiss government&lt;/a&gt; and large Swiss companies) be offered payment if Lufthansa's share price outperforms an airline index during the years following the merger. The two companies will continue to be run separately.\nOn 6 December 2006, Lufthansa placed an order for 20 &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20747-8\"&gt;Boeing 747-8&lt;/a&gt;s, becoming the launch customer of the passenger model. The airline is also the second European airline to operate the &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A380\"&gt;Airbus A380&lt;/a&gt; (after &lt;a href=\"Air%20France\"&gt;Air France&lt;/a&gt;). The first A380 was delivered on 19 May 2010, while the first 747-8 entered service in 2012.\nIn September 2008, Lufthansa Group announced its intent to purchase a stake in &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Airlines\"&gt;Brussels Airlines&lt;/a&gt; (SN). In June 2009, the EU Commission granted regulatory approval and Lufthansa acquired 45% of SN. In September 2016, Lufthansa announced it would purchase the remainder of Brussels Airlines for \u20ac2.6 million &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s. The transaction was completed in early January 2017. The decision was partially taken after the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Brussels%20bombings\"&gt;Brussels airport bombings of March 2016&lt;/a&gt;, which caused SN to lose almost \u20ac5 million per day until 3 April.\nIn September 2009, Lufthansa purchased Austrian Airlines with the approval of the European Commission.\nOn 11 June 2010, Airbus A380 service between Frankfurt and Tokyo (&lt;a href=\"Narita%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Narita&lt;/a&gt;) started.\n2010s: Belt-tightening.\nAfter a loss of 381 million euros in the first quarter of 2010 and another 13 million loss in the year 2011 due to the economic recession and restructuring costs, Deutsche Lufthansa AG cut 3,500 administrative positions or around 20 percent of the clerical total of 16,800. In 2012, Lufthansa announced a restructuring program called SCORE to improve its operating profit. As a part of the restructuring plan, the company started to transfer all short-haul flights outside its hubs in Frankfurt, Munich, and D\u00fcsseldorf to the company's re-branded &lt;a href=\"low-cost%20carrier\"&gt;low-cost carrier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Germanwings\"&gt;Germanwings&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn September 2013, Lufthansa Group announced its biggest order, for 59 wide-body aircraft valued more than 14 billion euros at list prices. Earlier in the same year, Lufthansa placed an order for 100 next-generation narrow-body aircraft.\nThe group has had a long-standing dispute with the Vereinigung Cockpit union which has demanded a scheme in which pilots can retire at the age of 55, and 60% of their pay be retained, which Lufthansa insists is no longer affordable. Lufthansa pilots were joined by pilots from the group's budget carrier Germanwings to stage a nationwide strike in support of their demands in April 2014 which lasted three days. The pilots staged a six-hour strike at the end of the summer holidays in September 2014, which caused the cancellation of 200 Lufthansa flights and 100 Germanwings flights.\nDuring the course of the &lt;a href=\"2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2014 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, part of the fleet was branded \"Fanhansa\". \nIn November 2014, Lufthansa signed an outsourcing deal worth $1.25 billion with &lt;a href=\"IBM\"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; that will see the US company take over the airline's IT infrastructure services division and staff.\nIn June 2015, Lufthansa announced plans to close its small long-haul base at &lt;a href=\"D%C3%BCsseldorf%20Airport\"&gt;D\u00fcsseldorf Airport&lt;/a&gt; for economic reasons by October 2015. At the time, the base consisted of two &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A340-300\"&gt;Airbus A340-300&lt;/a&gt;s rotating between &lt;a href=\"Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Newark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, service to Chicago from D\u00fcsseldorf was first made seasonal, suspended for the winter 2015 season, and then canceled altogether. Service to Newark, however, has been maintained. From the winter 2015 schedule through the end of the winter 2016 schedule, D\u00fcsseldorf was served by aircraft which also flew the Munich-Newark route. The D\u00fcsseldorf-Newark route ended on 30 November 2018, which was operated with an Airbus A330-300 aircraft. Their base was officially closed in March 2019.\nOn 22 March 2016, Lufthansa ended &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20737-500\"&gt;Boeing 737-500&lt;/a&gt; operations. The airline's last Boeing 737 (a 737-300) was retired on 29 October 2016, after a flight from &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; to Frankfurt. Lufthansa operated the 737 in several variants for almost 50 years, the first aircraft having been delivered on 27 December 1967.\nOn 4 December 2017, Lufthansa became the first European airline to receive the &lt;a href=\"Skytrax\"&gt;Skytrax&lt;/a&gt; 5 star certification. As stated by Skytrax, a key factor in the positive rating was the announcement of a new Business Class cabin and seating that was expected to be introduced in 2020. While this makes Lufthansa the 10th airline to be holding this award, in reality the 5th star was given to a product that was supposed to be introduced two years after the evaluation. In celebration, Lufthansa painted an &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A320%20family\"&gt;Airbus A320&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20747-8\"&gt;Boeing 747-8&lt;/a&gt; in the \"5 Starhansa\" livery.\nIn March 2018, Lufthansa and other airlines like &lt;a href=\"British%20Airways\"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"American%20Airlines\"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; accepted a request from Beijing to list Taiwan as part of China.\nIn March 2019 Lufthansa ordered 20 &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20787-9\"&gt;Boeing 787-9&lt;/a&gt; and an additional 20 &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A350-900\"&gt;Airbus A350-900&lt;/a&gt; for its own and the group's fleet replacement and expansion. Also, the airline announced it would sell six &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A380-800\"&gt;A380 aircraft&lt;/a&gt; back to Airbus, beginning in 2022.\n2020s: COVID-19 pandemic and recovery.\nOn 19 March 2020 Lufthansa cancelled 95 percent of all flights due to a &lt;a href=\"Travel%20restrictions%20related%20to%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;travel ban&lt;/a&gt; because of the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the airline incurred losses of 1 million euros per hour by April 2020. While Lufthansa reduced its costs throughout 2020, continuing health risks and travel restrictions still caused hourly losses of approximately 500,000 euros on average at the beginning of 2021. \nOn 14 May, Lufthansa's Hans DeHaan said the airline would resume flights between Toronto and &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; as of 3 June. Flights were banned on all &lt;a href=\"international%20non-essential%20travel\"&gt;international non-essential travel&lt;/a&gt; between Canada and the European Union. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, Lufthansa operated 64 weekly flights between the two countries. The airline's recovery plans involve high-density cargo to replace paying customers. The &lt;a href=\"Lufthansa%20Group\"&gt;Lufthansa Group&lt;/a&gt; airlines now require all passengers to wear a mask while aboard.\nOn 26 June, Deutsche Lufthansa AG shareholders voted in favour of accepting the capital measures and the participation of the Economic Stabilisation Fund (WSF) of the Federal Republic of Germany in Deutsche Lufthansa AG. In total, Lufthansa received about 9 billion euros in government assistance that summer.\nIn January 2021, Lufthansa CEO Spohr announced that the entire currently stored &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A340-600\"&gt;Airbus A340-600&lt;/a&gt; fleet will be retired with immediate effect and not return to service anymore.\nIn June 2021, Lufthansa said it wants to repay state aid it received during the pandemic before Germany's federal election in September 2021 if possible.\nIn June 2021, Lufthansa said it would change its communications to adopt a more &lt;a href=\"Gender-neutral%20language\"&gt;gender-neutral&lt;/a&gt; and inclusive language. It will remove greetings such as \"&lt;a href=\"Salutation\"&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn January 2022 Lufthansa admitted that they had flown over 18,000 empty flights to keep airport slots during the pandemic.\nCorporate affairs.\nOwnership.\nLufthansa was a &lt;a href=\"state-owned%20enterprise\"&gt;state-owned enterprise&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"flag%20carrier\"&gt;flag carrier&lt;/a&gt;) until 1994. Deutsche Lufthansa AG shares have been publicly traded on all German stock exchanges since 1966. In addition to floor trading, it is also traded electronically using the &lt;a href=\"Xetra%20%28trading%20system%29\"&gt;Xetra system&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=\"DAX\"&gt;DAX&lt;/a&gt; index share and is listed in the German Stock Exchange's Prime Standard. At the end of 2019, the shareholders\u2019 register showed that German investors held 67.3% of the shares (previous year: 72.1%). The second-largest group, with 10.4%, was shareholders from Luxembourg. Investors from the US accounted for 8.1%, followed by Ireland and the United Kingdom, each with 3.6%. This ensures compliance with the provisions of the German Aviation Compliance Documentation Act (LuftNaSiG). As of the reporting date, 58% of the shares were held by institutional investors (previous year: 53%), and 42% were held by private individuals (previous year: 47%). Lansdowne Partners International Ltd. and BlackRock, Inc. were the largest shareholders in the Lufthansa Group at year-end, with 4.9% and 3.1% respectively. All the transactions requiring disclosure and published during the financial year 2019, as well as the quarterly updates on the shareholder structure, are available online. During the 2020 COVID crisis &lt;a href=\"Heinz%20Hermann%20Thiele\"&gt;Heinz Hermann Thiele&lt;/a&gt; increased his stake to more than 12%; he died a few months later. The &lt;a href=\"free%20float\"&gt;free float&lt;/a&gt; for Lufthansa shares was 67% in 2020, as per the definition of the &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20B%C3%B6rse\"&gt;Deutsche B\u00f6rse&lt;/a&gt;.\nGerman Government Bail-out\nThe German government offered a \u20ac9 billion bailout to support the airline through COVID-19 induced economic issues. With this bailout, the government's stake in the airline increased to 20%, and also grant it board seats, while diluting existing shareholder stakes. The shareholders of the company approved the bailout on Thursday, June 26, offering the airline a fresh lease of life.\nBusiness trends.\nKey business and operating results of the Lufthansa Group for recent years are shown below (as at year ending 31 December):\nHeadquarters.\nLufthansa's corporate headquarters are in &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;. In 1971, Lawrence Fellows of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" described the then-new headquarters building that Lufthansa occupied in Cologne as \"gleaming\". In 1986, terrorists bombed the building. No one was injured. In 2006, builders laid the first stone of the new Lufthansa headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Deutz%2C%20Cologne\"&gt;Deutz, Cologne&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of 2007, Lufthansa planned to move 800 employees, including the company's finance department, to the new building. However, in early 2013 Lufthansa revealed plans to relocate its head office from Cologne to Frankfurt by 2017.\nSeveral Lufthansa departments are not at the headquarters; instead they are in the Lufthansa Aviation Center at &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20Airport\"&gt;Frankfurt Airport&lt;/a&gt;. These departments include Corporate Communications, Investor Relations, and Media Relations.\nAirline subsidiaries.\nIn addition to its main passenger operation, Lufthansa has several airline subsidiaries, including:\nOther subsidiaries.\nIn addition to the airlines mentioned above, Lufthansa maintains further aviation affiliated subsidiaries:\nBrand history.\nThe Lufthansa logo, an encircled stylized &lt;a href=\"crane%20%28bird%29\"&gt;crane&lt;/a&gt; in flight, was first created in 1918 by Otto Firle. It was part of the livery of the first German airline, &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Luft-Reederei\"&gt;Deutsche Luft-Reederei&lt;/a&gt; (abbreviated DLR), which began air service on 5 February 1919. In 1926, &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Luft%20Hansa\"&gt;Deutsche Luft Hansa&lt;/a&gt; adopted this symbol, and in 1954, Lufthansa expressed continuity by adopting it and later in 1963 \u2013 a variant thereof as redesigned by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Lisovskyi\"&gt;Robert Lisovskyi&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe original creator of the name Lufthansa is believed to be F.A. Fischer von Puturzyn. In 1925, he published a book entitled \"Luft-Hansa\" which examined the options open to aviation policymakers at the time. Luft Hansa was the name given to the new airline, which resulted from the merger of &lt;a href=\"Junkers\"&gt;Junkers&lt;/a&gt;' airline (&lt;a href=\"Junkers%20Luftverkehr\"&gt;Luftverkehr AG&lt;/a&gt;) and \"Deutscher Aero Lloyd\".\nAfter World War II, the company kept blue and yellow as its main colours and the crane logo. Since the beginning of the 1960s, &lt;a href=\"Helvetica\"&gt;Helvetica&lt;/a&gt; was used for the company name in the livery. The 1970s retro livery featured the top half of the fuselage painted in all-white on top and the lower fuselage (bottom half, including the engines) was gray/silver aluminium, below a blue cheatline window band and a black painted nose. The crane logo was painted blue on the engines, on the bottom half of the fuselage just below the cockpit windows, and a yellow circle inside a blue band on the tail.\nGerman designer &lt;a href=\"Otl%20Aicher\"&gt;Otl Aicher&lt;/a&gt; created a comprehensive corporate design for the airline in 1967. The crane logo was now always displayed in a circle which, on the livery, was yellow on an otherwise blue tailfin. Helvetica was used as the main typeface for both the livery and publications. The blue band and general paint scheme of the aircraft were retained from the previous livery.\nAicher's concept was retained in the 1988 design. The window band was removed and the fuselage was painted in grey.\nIn 2018, Lufthansa refreshed their livery. The encircled crane was retained, however, the background was changed from yellow to dark blue. The vertical stabilizer and the rear fuselage was all painted in dark blue, with the tail cone remained white. The main fuselage was painted in all white, and the brand name \"Lufthansa\" was painted above the windows, also in dark blue.\nAlliances and partnerships.\nCommercial.\nLufthansa bought a 19% stake in &lt;a href=\"JetBlue%20Airways\"&gt;JetBlue Airways&lt;/a&gt; in December 2007 and entered a code-sharing agreement with the airline. It was the first major investment by a European carrier in an American carrier since the &lt;a href=\"EU%E2%80%93U.S.%20Open%20Skies%20Agreement\"&gt;EU\u2013U.S. Open Skies Agreement&lt;/a&gt; came into effect in 2008. Lufthansa sold its stake in JetBlue in March 2015.\nIn late 2007, Lufthansa Cargo was forced to relocate a hub from &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 28 August 2008, Lufthansa and &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Airlines\"&gt;Brussels Airlines&lt;/a&gt; announced that they were negotiating joining together.\nLufthansa acquired a 45% stake in Brussels Airlines in 2009. It has an option to acquire the remaining 55% by 2017. As a part of the deal Brussels Airlines joined &lt;a href=\"Star%20Alliance\"&gt;Star Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in December 2009.\nOn 28 October 2008, Lufthansa exercised its option to purchase a further 60% share in &lt;a href=\"British%20Midland%20International\"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt; (in addition to the 20% Lufthansa already owned), this resulted in a dispute with the former owner &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Bishop%2C%20Baron%20Glendonbrook\"&gt;Sir Michael Bishop&lt;/a&gt;. Both parties reached an agreement at the end of June 2009, and the acquisition took place with effect from 1 July 2009. Lufthansa acquired the remaining 20% from Scandinavian Airlines on 1 November 2009, taking complete control of BMI.\nLufthansa completed the purchase of &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Airlines\"&gt;Austrian Airlines&lt;/a&gt; from the Austrian government in January 2009.\nIn 2010, Lufthansa was named in a &lt;a href=\"European%20Commission\"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; investigation into price-fixing, but was not fined because it acted as a whistleblower.\nIn April 2012, Lufthansa completed the sale of BMI to &lt;a href=\"International%20Airlines%20Group\"&gt;International Airlines Group&lt;/a&gt; (IAG), owner of British Airways and Iberia for \u00a3172.5 million.\nIn July 2012, a Qantas\u2013Lufthansa Technik maintenance deal for Tullamarine airport fell through due to having insufficient engine maintenance work to support the partnership. This resulted in 164 engineers being made redundant. This followed just months after the closing of heavy maintenance operations, which resulted in 400 additional job losses. It was announced that the Lufthansa Technik\u2013Qantas partnership would end in September.\nLufthansa also coordinates scheduling and ticket sales on transatlantic flights with Air Canada and United Airlines (as do Brussels Airlines, Swiss and Austrian Airlines). Lufthansa (with Swiss and Austrian Airlines) cooperates similarly with ANA on flights to Japan. Both ventures required the approval of competition authorities.\nTechnology.\nUntil April 2009 Lufthansa inventory and departure control systems, based on &lt;a href=\"Unisys\"&gt;Unisys&lt;/a&gt; were managed by &lt;a href=\"Lufthansa%20Systems\"&gt;LH Systems&lt;/a&gt;. Lufthansa reservations systems were outsourced to Amadeus in the early 1990s. Following a decision to outsource all components of the &lt;a href=\"Passenger%20Service%20System\"&gt;Passenger Service System&lt;/a&gt;, the functions were outsourced to the Alt\u00e9a platform managed by &lt;a href=\"Amadeus%20IT%20Group\"&gt;Amadeus&lt;/a&gt;.\nPartner airlines.\nLufthansa describes &lt;a href=\"Air%20Malta\"&gt;Air Malta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luxair\"&gt;Luxair&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"LATAM\"&gt;LATAM&lt;/a&gt; as partner airlines. The partnerships mainly involve code-sharing and recognition of each other's frequent flier programmes.\nSponsorships.\nLufthansa sponsors &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Eintracht%20Frankfurt\"&gt;Eintracht Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;. The Lufthansa Group also sponsors the German Sports Aid Foundation - promoting its sociopolitical goals and the athletes it sponsors.\nDestinations.\nCodeshare agreements.\nLufthansa &lt;a href=\"Codeshare%20agreement\"&gt;codeshares&lt;/a&gt; with the following airlines:\nLH Part of the Lufthansa Group.\nFleet.\nAircraft naming conventions.\nIn September 1960, a Lufthansa Boeing 707 (D-ABOC), which would serve the Frankfurt-New York intercontinental route, was christened \"Berlin\" after the divided city of Berlin by then-mayor &lt;a href=\"Willy%20Brandt\"&gt;Willy Brandt&lt;/a&gt;. Following \"Berlin\", other Lufthansa 707 planes were named \"&lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;M\u00fcnchen&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Bonn\"&gt;Bonn&lt;/a&gt;.\" With these names, the company established a tradition of &lt;a href=\"Ship%20naming%20and%20launching\"&gt;naming&lt;/a&gt; the planes in its fleet after German cities and towns or federal states, with a rule of thumb that the airplane make, size, or route would correspond roughly to the relative size or importance of the city or town it was named after.\nThis tradition continued, with two notable exceptions, until 2010: The first was an &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A340-300\"&gt;Airbus A340-300&lt;/a&gt; registered D-AIFC, named \"Gander/Halifax\", after &lt;a href=\"Gander%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Gander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;, two Canadian cities along the standard flight path from Europe to North America. It became the first Lufthansa airplane named after a non-German city. The name commemorates the hospitality of the communities of Gander and Halifax, which served as improvised safe havens for the passengers and crew of the multitude of international aircraft unable to return to their originating airports during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Yellow%20Ribbon\"&gt;Operation Yellow Ribbon&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks\"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt;. The other aircraft not named after a German city was an &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A321-100\"&gt;Airbus A321-100&lt;/a&gt; registered as D-AIRA, which was designated \"Finkenwerder\" in honor of the Airbus facility in the district of &lt;a href=\"Finkenwerder\"&gt;Hamburg-Finkenwerder&lt;/a&gt;, where about 40% of Airbus narrowbody models are manufactured.\nIn February 2010, Lufthansa announced that its first two &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A380\"&gt;Airbus A380&lt;/a&gt;s would be named \"Frankfurt am Main\" (D-AIMA) and \"M\u00fcnchen\" (D-AIMB) after Lufthansa's two hub airports. Subsequent A380 aircraft were named after other Lufthansa Group hub airports \"&lt;a href=\"Zurich\"&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Wien\" (&lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;) and \"Br\u00fcssel\" (&lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;) and the major German cities of \"&lt;a href=\"D%C3%BCsseldorf\"&gt;D\u00fcsseldorf&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;\". The remaining A380s were named after &lt;a href=\"Star%20Alliance\"&gt;Star Alliance&lt;/a&gt; hub cities \"Tokyo\", \"Beijing\", \"Johannesburg\", \"New York\", \"San Francisco\" and \"Delhi\". However, D-AIMN \"San Francisco\" was renamed \"Deutschland\" (Germany) in 2016.\nAs of 2016, there are several short- and long-haul aircraft in Lufthansa's fleet that do not bear any name. They either never received one or their former one has been given to a newer aircraft, which was the case for several &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20747-400\"&gt;Boeing 747-400&lt;/a&gt;s. For example, the former \"Bayern\" (&lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;), a Boeing 747-400 still in active service lost that name to a new &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20747-8\"&gt;Boeing 747-8I&lt;/a&gt;.\nVintage aircraft restoration.\n&lt;a href=\"Lufthansa%20Technik\"&gt;Lufthansa Technik&lt;/a&gt;, the airline's maintenance arm, restored a &lt;a href=\"Junkers%20Ju%2052/3m\"&gt;Junkers Ju 52/3m&lt;/a&gt; built in 1936 to &lt;a href=\"airworthy\"&gt;airworthiness&lt;/a&gt;; this aircraft was in use on the 10-hour Berlin to Rome route, across the &lt;a href=\"Alps\"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt;, in the 1930s. Lufthansa is now restoring a &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Super%20Constellation\"&gt;Lockheed Super Constellation&lt;/a&gt;, using parts from three such aircraft bought at auctions. Lufthansa's Super Constellations and L1649 \"Starliners\" served routes such as &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Dakar\"&gt;Dakar&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Caracas\"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Santiago%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Santiago&lt;/a&gt;. Lufthansa Technik recruits retired employees and volunteers for skilled labour.\nAirbus A380.\nLufthansa had initially ordered a total of 15 &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A380-800\"&gt;Airbus A380-800&lt;/a&gt;, of which by June 2012 ten were delivered. In September 2011, the order was increased by two more to 17, this order was confirmed on 14 March 2013. However, in September 2013 it was announced that the Lufthansa Supervisory Board had approved the purchase of only twelve of the first 15 A380s. Thus, a total of 14 A380s have been added to the fleet.\nLufthansa uses its A380s from and to Frankfurt am Main (9 aircraft) and since March 2018 to and from Munich as well (5 aircraft). From 6 to 12 December 2011, Lufthansa already used an A380 once a day on the route from Munich to New York-JFK. This happened mainly against the backdrop of Christmas shopping in New York City.\nOn 13 March 2019, Lufthansa announced that it will be removing 6 &lt;a href=\"Airbus%20A380\"&gt;A380&lt;/a&gt; aircraft from the fleet and replacing them with Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A350-900 aircraft.\nOn 8 March 2020, Lufthansa announced that it would be grounding all of its A380 aircraft due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.\nServices.\nFrequent-flyer programme.\nLufthansa's &lt;a href=\"Frequent-flyer%20program\"&gt;frequent-flyer&lt;/a&gt; programme is called \"Miles &amp; More\", and is shared among several European airlines, including all of Lufthansa's subsidiary airlines (excluding the &lt;a href=\"SunExpress\"&gt;SunExpress&lt;/a&gt; joint ventures), plus &lt;a href=\"Adria%20Airways\"&gt;Adria Airways&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Condor%20Flugdienst\"&gt;Condor Flugdienst&lt;/a&gt; (formerly owned by Lufthansa), &lt;a href=\"Croatia%20Airlines\"&gt;Croatia Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LOT%20Polish%20Airlines\"&gt;LOT Polish Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Luxair\"&gt;Luxair&lt;/a&gt; (stake formerly held by Lufthansa). Miles &amp; More members may earn miles on Lufthansa flights and &lt;a href=\"Star%20Alliance\"&gt;Star Alliance&lt;/a&gt; partner flights, as well as through Lufthansa credit cards, and purchases made through the Lufthansa shops. Status within Miles &amp; More is determined by miles flown during one calendar year with specific partners. Membership levels include: Miles &amp; More member (no minimal threshold), Frequent Traveller (Silver, threshold or 30 individual flights), Senator (Gold, threshold), and HON Circle (Black, threshold over two calendar years). All Miles &amp; More status levels higher than Miles &amp; More member offer lounge access and executive bonus miles, with the higher levels offering more exclusive benefits.\nCabins.\nFirst Class.\nFirst Class is offered on most long-haul aircraft (all A340-600s, the front part of the upper deck of all Airbus A380s, and the main deck nose section of all Boeing 747-8Is). Each seat converts to a bed, includes laptop power outlets, as well as entertainment facilities. Meals are available on demand. Lufthansa offers dedicated First Class check-in counters at most airports, and offers dedicated First Class lounges in &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a dedicated first-class terminal in Frankfurt. Arriving passengers have the option of using Lufthansa's First Class arrival facilities, as well as the new Welcome Lounge. Lufthansa has introduced a new First Class product aboard the Airbus A380 and plans to gradually introduce it on all of its long-haul aircraft.\nWith the new program SCORE, introduced to boost profits by 1.5 billion euros over the following years, LH will stop route expansion and extensively decrease its First Class offerings on most routes. However, First Class will not be completely eliminated, as the company plans to introduce a new First Class cabin on the Airbus A350-900 or Boeing , with a primary focus on privacy. However, the new first class will not be on the first few 777-9s, since those will not have any first class cabin.\nBusiness Class.\nBusiness Class is offered on all long-haul aircraft. Seats convert to lie-flat beds and include laptop power outlets and entertainment facilities. Lufthansa offers dedicated Business Class check-in counters at all airports, as well as dedicated Business Class lounges at most airports, or contract lounges at other airports, as well as the Lufthansa Welcome Lounge upon arrival in Frankfurt. As of 2014, Business Class on all wide-body aircraft feature lie-flat seats. Lufthansa released plans for a new business class set to be released in 2022 on either the Boeing 787-9 or Airbus A350-900, and will retrofit the rest of the fleet in the coming years.\nPremium Economy.\nIntroduced in 2014, Lufthansa's long-haul Premium Economy is being rolled out on all long-haul aircraft, starting with some Boeing 747-8Is. Similar in design to &lt;a href=\"Air%20Canada\"&gt;Air Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s Premium Economy or &lt;a href=\"British%20Airways\"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt;' World Traveller Plus cabins, Premium Economy features pitch along with up to more width than economy class, depending on the aircraft. The seats also feature a personal seat-back entertainment screen and a larger armrest separating seats. Along with the planned introduction of the Boeing 777-9X, the airline plans to add a new Premium Economy cabin with a \"shell\" design. These seats are also to be installed on SWISS' Boeing 777-300ERs and Airbus A340-300s from the first and second quarter of 2021, respectively.\nEconomy Class.\nLufthansa's long-haul Economy Class is offered on all long-haul aircraft. All have a seat pitch except the Airbus A380s, which have a seat pitch. Passengers receive meals, as well as free drinks. The whole fleet offers Audio-Video-On-Demand (&lt;a href=\"AVOD\"&gt;AVOD&lt;/a&gt;) screens in Economy Class.\nAirport lounges and terminals.\nLufthansa operates four types of lounges within its destination network: First Class, Senator, Business, and Welcome Lounges. Each departure lounge is accessible both through travel class, or Miles and More/Star Alliance status; the Welcome Lounge is limited to arriving premium passengers of the Lufthansa Group and United Airlines only.\nLufthansa also operates a dedicated first class terminal at Frankfurt Airport. The first terminal of its kind, access is limited only to departing Lufthansa First Class, same day Lufthansa Group first class and HON Circle members. Approximately 200 staff care for approximately 300 passengers per day in the terminal, which features a full-service restaurant, full bar, cigar lounge, relaxation rooms, and offices, as well as bath facilities. Guests are driven directly to their departing flight by Mercedes &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz%20S-Class\"&gt;S-Class&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz%20V-Class\"&gt;V-Class&lt;/a&gt;, or Porsche &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20Cayenne\"&gt;Cayenne&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Porsche%20Panamera\"&gt;Panamera&lt;/a&gt; vehicles.\nBus service.\nLufthansa previously operated a check-in point in the city limits of &lt;a href=\"Nuremberg\"&gt;Nuremberg&lt;/a&gt; and a bus service from Nuremberg to &lt;a href=\"Munich%20Airport\"&gt;Munich Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccidents and incidents.\nThis is a list of accidents and incidents involving Lufthansa mainline aircraft since 1956. For earlier occurrences, refer to &lt;a href=\"Hestnutan%20Accident\"&gt;Deutsche Luft Hansa&lt;/a&gt;. For accidents and incidents on Lufthansa-branded flights which were operated by other airlines, see the respective articles (&lt;a href=\"Lufthansa%20CityLine%23Accidents%20and%20incidents\"&gt;Lufthansa CityLine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lufthansa%20Cargo%23Accidents%20and%20incidents\"&gt;Lufthansa Cargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lufthansa%20Flight%20288\"&gt;Contact Air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germanwings%23Incidents%20and%20accidents\"&gt;Germanwings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Air%20Dolomiti%23Accidents%20and%20incidents\"&gt;Air Dolomiti&lt;/a&gt;).\nCriticism.\nEmployment relations.\nRelations between Lufthansa and their pilots have been very tense in the past years, with many strikes occurring, causing many flights to be cancelled, as well as major losses to the company.&lt;ref name=\"ksb/bk 2015\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A major dispute between Lufthansa and the pilot's union has been settled after nearly five years and overall 14 strikes in December 2017.\nGermanwings crisis management.\nGermanwings was a subsidiary of Lufthansa. Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa's CEO, oversaw the &lt;a href=\"Germanwings%20Flight%209525\"&gt;Germanwings Flight 9525&lt;/a&gt; accident, \"the darkest day for Lufthansa in its 60-year history\".\nNonetheless, damage control by Spohr and his team was poor according to several sources, as compared to other CEOs in the face of a major accident, with contradictory information given about the mental health and the airworthiness of the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. It was revealed that Lubitz suffered from a severe case of depression and mental disorders and had intentionally crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 into the French Alps, killing all 150 aboard. Spohr had misleadingly said the co-pilot \"was 100% airworthy without any restrictions, without any conditions\".\nGDS surcharge.\nOn 1 September 2015, Lufthansa implemented a 16 euro surcharge on &lt;a href=\"Global%20Distribution%20System\"&gt;Global Distribution System&lt;/a&gt; bookings. The surcharge is payable unless tickets are purchased directly from the airline's website, or at its service centres and ticket counters at the airport. In a statement responding to Lufthansa's strategy, Amadeus, a travel technology company, said the new model would make \"comparison and transparency more difficult because travellers will now be forced to go to multiple channels to search for the best fares. For the period between 1\u201314 September, the airline experienced a 16.1% drop in revenue, indicating to some that the new fee backfired, although the airline maintains the statement that the decrease was due to the pilot strike, and \"other seasonal effects\".\nDeportation flights.\nActivists from Germany have criticised Lufthansa for performing deportation flights on behalf of the German government. In 2019, 4,573 people were deported on their planes, while their subsidiary Eurowings performed 1,312 deportations. This totals more than 25% of deportations in Germany in 2019. At least two deportees perished during transport.\nTreatment of World War II-era past.\nLufthansa has been criticized for lack of transparency about the use of more than 10,000 &lt;a href=\"Forced%20labour%20under%20German%20rule%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;forced laborers&lt;/a&gt;, many of them children, by its predecessor company, Deutsche Luft Hansa, during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. \nGhost flights.\nLufthansa operated 18,000 empty or near-empty flights in winter 2021 to avoid losing take-off and landing rights at major airports."
