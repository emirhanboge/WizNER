After winning the title back, they engaged in a feud with &lt;a href=\"America%27s%20Most%20Wanted%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;America's Most Wanted&lt;/a&gt;, defeating them in a match at &lt;a href=\"Genesis%202006\"&gt;Genesis&lt;/a&gt; and then a flag match at &lt;a href=\"Turning%20Point%202006\"&gt;Turning Point&lt;/a&gt;. Their next rivalry involved &lt;a href=\"Dudley%20Boyz\"&gt;Team 3D&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Devon%20Hughes\"&gt;Brother Devon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mark%20LoMonaco\"&gt;Brother Ray&lt;/a&gt;), and, after winning three consecutive matches at &lt;a href=\"Final%20Resolution%202007\"&gt;Final Resolution&lt;/a&gt; (by disqualification), &lt;a href=\"Against%20All%20Odds%202007\"&gt;Against All Odds&lt;/a&gt; (in a Little Italy Street fight) and &lt;a href=\"Destination%20X%20%282007%29\"&gt;Destination X&lt;/a&gt; (in a Ghetto Brawl), lost the NWA tag-team championships to Team 3D at &lt;a href=\"Lockdown%20%282007%29\"&gt;Lockdown&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Electrified%20Cage%20match\"&gt;Electrified Cage match&lt;/a&gt;, when Homicide was pinned. When Konnan left TNA in the summer of 2007, both Hernandez and Homicide turned &lt;a href=\"Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;face&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Bound%20for%20Glory%20%282007%29\"&gt;Bound for Glory&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Low%20Ki\"&gt;Senshi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elix%20Skipper\"&gt;Elix Skipper&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Triple%20X%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;Triple X&lt;/a&gt; in an Ultimate X match to get back in the tag team title picture. They would receive their shot at the &lt;a href=\"TNA%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship\"&gt;TNA World Tag Team Championship&lt;/a&gt; on the November 1 episode of \"Impact!\", but were defeated by the defending champions &lt;a href=\"A.J.%20Styles\"&gt;A.J. Styles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Travis%20Tomko\"&gt;Tomko&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2008 LAX got another title shot by beating &lt;a href=\"The%20Rock%20%27n%20Rave%20Infection\"&gt;The Rock 'n Rave Infection&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Rave\"&gt;Jimmy Rave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Hoyt\"&gt;Lance Rock&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"The%20Motor%20City%20Machine%20Guns\"&gt;The Motor City Machine Guns&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Alex%20Shelley\"&gt;Alex Shelley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Sabin\"&gt;Chris Sabin&lt;/a&gt;) at &lt;a href=\"Destination%20X%20%282008%29\"&gt;Destination X&lt;/a&gt; and cashed it in during a three-way match on the April 17 episode of \"Impact!\" against the Tag Team Champions A.J. Styles and Tomko and the team that ended up winning the match, &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Young%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Eric Young/Super Eric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frankie%20Kazarian\"&gt;Kaz&lt;/a&gt;. The controversial ending of this match led to the title being vacated and being put up for grabs in a tournament. At &lt;a href=\"Sacrifice%20%282008%29\"&gt;Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, LAX, with their new manager &lt;a href=\"Hector%20Guerrero\"&gt;Hector Guerrero&lt;/a&gt; in their corner, won the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship, after defeating Team 3D in the finals of the &lt;a href=\"Deuces%20Wild%20Tag%20Team%20Tournament\"&gt;\"Deuces Wild Tournament\"&lt;/a&gt;. LAX lost the title at &lt;a href=\"Hard%20Justice%20%282008%29\"&gt;Hard Justice&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Beer%20Money%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Beer Money, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"James%20Storm\"&gt;James Storm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Roode\"&gt;Robert Roode&lt;/a&gt;).\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Final%20Resolution%20%28December%202008%29\"&gt;second Final Resolution pay-per-view of 2008&lt;/a&gt;, both Hernandez and Homicide each captured a briefcase from the \"Feast or Fired\" match which contained a shot at the &lt;a href=\"TNA%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship\"&gt;TNA World Heavyweight Championship&lt;/a&gt; for Hernandez and a shot at the &lt;a href=\"TNA%20X%20Division%20Championship\"&gt;TNA X Division Championship&lt;/a&gt; for Homicide. On a January 15 episode of TNA Impact, Hernandez cashed in his \"Feast or Fired\" World Title shot against Sting, and won by disqualification when &lt;a href=\"The%20Main%20Event%20Mafia\"&gt;The Main Event Mafia&lt;/a&gt; interfered, which meant that he did not win the title. However, executive shareholder &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Foley\"&gt;Mick Foley&lt;/a&gt; ruled that because of the interference Hernandez would receive another TNA Title Shot in the future. On the April 30, episode of \"Impact!\", Hernandez was attacked by the debuting &lt;a href=\"The%20British%20Invasion%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;British Invasion&lt;/a&gt; faction of &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Aldis\"&gt;Brutus Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doug%20Williams%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Doug Williams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Terry\"&gt;Rob Terry&lt;/a&gt;, to allow him time off to recover from a legitimate neck surgery.\nOn the July 23 episode of \"Impact!\" Hernandez returned to aid Homicide, who was being attacked by &lt;a href=\"Samoa%20Joe\"&gt;Samoa Joe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tazz\"&gt;Taz&lt;/a&gt;. A week later, on July 30, he defeated Joe in his return match with a top rope splash. At &lt;a href=\"Hard%20Justice%20%282009%29\"&gt;Hard Justice&lt;/a&gt; Hernandez regained his \"Feast or Fired\" briefcase from the British Invasion by defeating Rob Terry in nine seconds. On the September 10 episode of \"Impact!\", Homicide turned heel by betraying Hernandez and joining World Elite, thus signaling the official end of the Latin American Xchange. At &lt;a href=\"No%20Surrender%20%282009%29\"&gt;No Surrender&lt;/a&gt; Hernandez cashed in his \"Feast or Fired\" briefcase, but was unable to win the World Heavyweight Championship in the 5-way main event match after World Elite leader Eric Young interfered and took him out of the match. At &lt;a href=\"Bound%20for%20Glory%20%282009%29\"&gt;Bound for Glory&lt;/a&gt;, Hernandez was unsuccessful in capturing the &lt;a href=\"TNA%20Global%20Championship\"&gt;TNA Legends Championship&lt;/a&gt; in a three-way match, involving champion Kevin Nash and Eric Young, after Young turned on Nash and captured the title.\nTeaming and feuding with Matt Morgan (2010\u20132011).\nSince then Hernandez teamed up with &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Morgan\"&gt;Matt Morgan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"D%27Angelo%20Dinero\"&gt;D'Angelo Dinero&lt;/a&gt; and moved on to feuding with Rhino and Team 3D, who accused TNA of favoring the younger talent of the company. At &lt;a href=\"Turning%20Point%20%282009%20wrestling%29\"&gt;Turning Point&lt;/a&gt; Rhino and Team 3D defeated Morgan, Hernandez and Dinero in a street fight. At &lt;a href=\"Final%20Resolution%20%282009%29\"&gt;Final Resolution&lt;/a&gt; Morgan, Hernandez, Dinero and &lt;a href=\"Suicide%20%28character%29\"&gt;Suicide&lt;/a&gt; defeated Neal, Team 3D and Rhino in an eight-man elimination tag team match. On the January 4, 2010, live, three-hour, Monday night episode of \"Impact!\" Hernandez and Morgan defeated &lt;a href=\"Stevie%20Richards\"&gt;Dr. Stevie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raven%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Raven&lt;/a&gt; to become the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Champions British Invasion. At &lt;a href=\"Genesis%20%282010%29\"&gt;Genesis&lt;/a&gt; Hernandez and Morgan defeated the British Invasion to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. At &lt;a href=\"Against%20All%20Odds%20%282010%29\"&gt;Against All Odds&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling%20tournaments%238%20Card%20Stud%20Tournament\"&gt;8 Card Stud Tournament&lt;/a&gt; Hernandez and Morgan were forced to face each other in the first round. Morgan defeated Hernandez by taking advantage of his injured shoulder and pinning him, while grabbing a hold of his trunks. At &lt;a href=\"Destination%20X%20%282010%29\"&gt;Destination X&lt;/a&gt; Hernandez and Morgan retained the Tag Team Title in a match against Beer Money despite plenty of miscommunication between the two champions. After the match Morgan nailed Hernandez with the Carbon Footprint. The following day on \"Impact!\" Morgan defeated Hernandez via referee stoppage after sandwiching his head between his boot and the ring post. After the match Homicide came out to check on his former partner, who was being helped by medics. TNA later reported on Hernandez's kayfabe injuries, claiming that he had suffered a herniated disc and cervical damage to his neck in the assault and will be out of action indefinitely. The neck injury storyline was created so Hernandez could work in Mexico for three months.\nWith Hernandez scheduled to miss months of action, Morgan declared himself the sole World Tag Team Champion on the April 5 episode of \"Impact!\" and TNA went along with this and no longer recognized Hernandez as a champion.\nHernandez's return to TNA was hinted at on the June 3 episode of \"Impact!\", when Matt Morgan was distracted by somebody in the crowd which cost him a four-way match with Samoa Joe, &lt;a href=\"Sting%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Sting&lt;/a&gt; and the winner of the match, TNA World Heavyweight Champion &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Van%20Dam\"&gt;Rob Van Dam&lt;/a&gt;. The camera's immediately showed what was distracting Morgan, but nobody could clearly see who it was, although Taz and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Tenay\"&gt;Mike Tenay&lt;/a&gt; believed it to be Hernandez. The following week, Hernandez made his official return by attacking Morgan, leading to a match between the two at &lt;a href=\"Slammiversary%20VIII\"&gt;Slammiversary VIII&lt;/a&gt;. The match at Slammiversary VIII ended in Hernandez being disqualified for assaulting the referee, when he was being reprimanded for going too violently after Morgan. The following month at &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Road%20%282010%29\"&gt;Victory Road&lt;/a&gt; Hernandez defeated Morgan in a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Cage%20match\"&gt;Steel Cage match&lt;/a&gt; to end the feud. In November it was reported that Hernandez had turned down TNA's request for him to return to the promotion from his stint in Mexico.\nMexican America (2011\u20132012).\nHernandez returned to TNA from his stint in Mexico at the February 1, 2011, tapings of the February 10 episode of \"Impact!\". He made his return as a heel, when he was hired by &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Bischoff\"&gt;Eric Bischoff&lt;/a&gt; to \"hurt a few people\" for his &lt;a href=\"Immortal%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;Immortal&lt;/a&gt; stable. Hernandez then re\u2013ignited his feud with the now\u2013face Matt Morgan by costing him the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a match against &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Kennedy\"&gt;Mr. Anderson&lt;/a&gt;. On February 13 at &lt;a href=\"Against%20All%20Odds%20%282011%29\"&gt;Against All Odds&lt;/a&gt; Hernandez explained the change in his attitude by claiming that in the United States he was treated like a second class citizen, while in Mexico he was treated like a star. On the following episode of \"Impact!\", Hernandez aligned himself with &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Stock\"&gt;Sarita&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thea%20Trinidad\"&gt;Rosita&lt;/a&gt;. On the March 3 episode of \"Impact!\" Hernandez was defeated by Morgan via disqualification. On March 13 at &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Road%20%282011%29\"&gt;Victory Road&lt;/a&gt;, Hernandez defeated Morgan in a &lt;a href=\"First%20Blood%20match\"&gt;First Blood match&lt;/a&gt;, after using fake blood on him, following a run\u2013in from a &lt;a href=\"Plant%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;planted fan&lt;/a&gt;. On the following episode of \"Impact!\", the alliance of Hernandez, Sarita and Rosita was named &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20America%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;Mexican America&lt;/a&gt;. The three of them were then defeated in a six-person street fight by Morgan, &lt;a href=\"Angelina%20Love\"&gt;Angelina Love&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Katarina%20Waters\"&gt;Winter&lt;/a&gt;. After the match, the \"fan\", who had interfered in the match at Victory Road, once again entered the ring and attacked Morgan. On the March 24 episode of \"Impact!\", he was officially presented as the newest member of Mexican America and named &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Barela\"&gt;Anarquia&lt;/a&gt;. According to Hernandez, the original plan was to find a partner in Mexico, but TNA decided to include Anarquia as his tag team partner. On April 17 at &lt;a href=\"Lockdown%20%282011%29\"&gt;Lockdown&lt;/a&gt;, Morgan defeated Hernandez in a steel cage match to win the feud. After defeating &lt;a href=\"Ink%20Inc.\"&gt;Ink Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jesse%20Neal\"&gt;Jesse Neal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shannon%20Moore\"&gt;Shannon Moore&lt;/a&gt;) at &lt;a href=\"Sacrifice%20%282011%29\"&gt;Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; and the team of Alex Shelley and TNA World Tag Team Champion James Storm on the June 9 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Hernandez and Anarquia began demanding a tag team title shot, claiming that they were held back because of their race. On the July 14 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Hernandez and Anarquia defeated The British Invasion (Douglas Williams and Magnus), with help from Rosita, to become the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Hernandez and Anarquia received their shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship on August 7 at &lt;a href=\"Hardcore%20Justice%20%282011%29\"&gt;Hardcore Justice&lt;/a&gt;, but were defeated by the defending champions, Beer Money, Inc. Two days later, at the tapings of the August 18 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Hernandez and Anarquia defeated Beer Money, Inc. in a rematch, following interference from the \"&lt;a href=\"AAA%20Mega%20Championship\"&gt;Mexican Heavyweight Champion&lt;/a&gt;\" Jeff Jarrett, to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On September 11 at &lt;a href=\"No%20Surrender%20%282011%29\"&gt;No Surrender&lt;/a&gt;, Hernandez and Anarquia successfully defended the title against D'Angelo Dinero and Devon, following interference from Rosita and Sarita. Later that month, Mexican America began feuding with Ink Inc., stemming from their match at Sacrifice in May, where Hernandez had legitimately injured Jesse Neal. On October 16, during the &lt;a href=\"Bound%20for%20Glory%20%282011%29\"&gt;Bound for Glory&lt;/a&gt; Preshow, Mexican America successfully defended the TNA World Tag Team Championship against Ink Inc. The following month at &lt;a href=\"Turning%20Point%20%282011%20wrestling%29\"&gt;Turning Point&lt;/a&gt;, Anarquia, Hernandez and Sarita defeated Ink Inc.'s Jesse Neal, Shannon Moore and &lt;a href=\"Christina%20Von%20Eerie\"&gt;Toxxin&lt;/a&gt; in a six-person tag team match to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the following episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Hernandez and Anarquia lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Mercer\"&gt;Crimson&lt;/a&gt; and Matt Morgan. On the following episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Hernandez and Arnaquia failed to regain the title in a rematch. After spending three months off television, Hernandez returned on the March 22, 2012, episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", when he and Anarquia unsuccessfully challenged Magnus and Samoa Joe for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. In April, Anarquia was released from his TNA contract, thus ending his partnership with Hernandez. According to Hernandez, TNA wanted to create a more stereotypical stable, but Hernandez refused to use Mexican jargon, so TNA gave the promos to Anarquia. Hernandez said Mexican America was the worst part of his career and the stable was doomed from the beginning.\nTeaming with Chavo Guerrero (2012\u20132014).\nFollowing Anarquia's departure, Hernandez remained inactive, before returning on June 10 at &lt;a href=\"Slammiversary%20%282012%29\"&gt;Slammiversary&lt;/a&gt;, which took place in his home state of Texas, defeating &lt;a href=\"Kid%20Kash\"&gt;Kid Kash&lt;/a&gt; in a singles match.

On August 12 at &lt;a href=\"Hardcore%20Justice%20%282012%29\"&gt;Hardcore Justice&lt;/a&gt;, Hernandez and Guerrero defeated Gunner and Kash in a tag team match. On the September 6 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Hernandez and Guerrero, after being hand-picked by &lt;a href=\"Hulk%20Hogan\"&gt;Hulk Hogan&lt;/a&gt; as the number one contenders, unsuccessfully challenged Christopher Daniels and Kazarian for the &lt;a href=\"TNA%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship\"&gt;TNA World Tag Team Championship&lt;/a&gt;.
