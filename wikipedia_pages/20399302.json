Lord Dufferin left a memoir of their journey entitled \"&lt;a href=\"Narrative%20of%20a%20Journey%20from%20Oxford%20to%20Skibbereen%20during%20the%20Year%20of%20the%20Irish%20Famine\"&gt;Narrative of a Journey from Oxford to Skibbereen during the Year of the Irish Famine&lt;/a&gt;\" published in 1847 (27 pages).\nHe married Hon. Montague Abercromby (1835\u20131931), daughter of &lt;a href=\"George%20Abercromby%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Abercromby\"&gt;George Abercromby, 3rd Baron Abercromby&lt;/a&gt; and Louisa Penuel Forbes, on 29 April 1856. They had two daughters\nHe was elected at a &lt;a href=\"1865%20Buteshire%20by-election\"&gt;by-election in February 1865&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (MP) for &lt;a href=\"Buteshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Buteshire&lt;/a&gt;, but held the seat only until the &lt;a href=\"1865%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;general election in July 1865&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe succeeded to his half brother's titles on 11 March 1869.\nHe held the offices of &lt;a href=\"deputy%20lieutenant\"&gt;deputy lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Fife\"&gt;Fife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Renfrewshire\"&gt;Renfrewshire&lt;/a&gt;. He held the office of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Clerk%20Register\"&gt;Lord Clerk Register&lt;/a&gt; of Scotland from 1879 until his death.\nHe died at age 64, without male issue. On his death, the UK barony of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ross\"&gt;Ross of Hawkhead&lt;/a&gt; became extinct.\nReligion.\nBoyle was an &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Episcopal%20Church\"&gt;Episcopalian&lt;/a&gt; and was a long time associate of Bishop &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Penrose%20Forbes\"&gt;Alexander Penrose Forbes&lt;/a&gt; and a supporter of his views. Correspondence between the two men is held by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Dundee\"&gt;University of Dundee&lt;/a&gt;'s archives. In 1848 the Boyle founded a choir school attached to the Church of St. Andrews, &lt;a href=\"Millport%2C%20Cumbrae\"&gt;Millport&lt;/a&gt;. He followed this up in 1849 by founding and endowing the Episcopal College and &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20The%20Isles\"&gt;Collegiate Church of the Holy Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cumbrae\"&gt;Cumbrae&lt;/a&gt;. The college was completed in 1851 to plans by William Butterfield and was later affiliated to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Durham\"&gt;University of Durham&lt;/a&gt; as Cumbrae Theological College. While the Collegiate Church was elevated to the status of Cathedral of Argyll and the Isles in 1879, the college ultimately closed in 1888."
