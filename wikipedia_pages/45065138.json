She runs away to the city and, after many adventures, is rescued by The Salvation Army and made a member of their order. When her county lover Luke (Anderson) finds her, she is about to embark for France, so he enlists in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Expeditionary%20Forces\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; in the hope of meeting her in Europe. Harry Hammond (O'Brien), a son of wealth who has scorned The Salvation Army, is &lt;a href=\"Shanghaiing\"&gt;shanghaied&lt;/a&gt; and taken to London, where a representative of the order persuades him to enlist in the aviation corps. His fiance Agnes Traverse (De Remer), learning of his whereabouts, also dons the scarlet ribboned bonnet and arrives in France. Harry is wounded and Elizabeth, who has learned to love him, remains behind with him when the Allies retreat. Luke arrives and casts his lot with them, and the three hide in the cellar of a deserted chateau taken by the Germans. They resist capture until rescued by the American forces. A military wedding ceremony unites Harry and Agnes and Luke and Elizabeth."
