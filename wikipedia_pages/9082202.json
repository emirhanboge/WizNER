    "text": "BELAM (; ) is a defunct plan for a &lt;a href=\"Rapid%20transit\"&gt;rapid transit system&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Belgrade\"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;. It was due to begin construction in 2008. It was intended to relieve Belgrade's growing traffic congestion issues, with the first stretch of line opening in 2012. The first line has an estimated cost of 450 million &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;, taking some 5 years to complete.\nConcept.\nThe idea to construct a &lt;a href=\"rapid%20transit\"&gt;rapid transit&lt;/a&gt; system in &lt;a href=\"Belgrade\"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; originates from the 1950s when it was driven by Belgrade's blooming number of inhabitants and the lack of adequate &lt;a href=\"transport\"&gt;transport&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure. However, the inability to decide between proposals to construct a modern &lt;a href=\"tram\"&gt;tram&lt;/a&gt; system and a classic underground one meant that the project was to stay largely stagnating in years to come. The &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20wars\"&gt;political turmoil&lt;/a&gt; of the 1990s and lack of potential funding extinguished further development of the idea.\nWith the beginning of the 21st century, however, the idea came to life once again, facing similar problems. Despite fierce debates on the most adequate solution, Belgrade's present leadership pressed on with a &lt;a href=\"Feasibility%20study\"&gt;pre-feasibility study&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"light%20rail\"&gt;light rail&lt;/a&gt; system which received a positive review in the late 2001. BELAM, consequently, became an integral part of Belgrade's master plan for 2021. Construction was due to begin in 2006, but was postponed till 2008. Serbian group &lt;a href=\"JUGINUS\"&gt;JUGINUS&lt;/a&gt; () and Spanish &lt;a href=\"INECO\"&gt;INECO&lt;/a&gt; are in charge of the construction.\nAlthough the project's implementation seems rather certain at this point, fierce criticism by opponents has not ceased. Their main argument remains that the only criterion for choosing light rail over conventional metro was the comparatively low cost. They insist that constructing a light rail transit system will not deal with the capital's transport issues in the long run.\nOn the other hand, project supporters maintain that the economic aspect is essential. Furthermore, they claim that estimates on maximal usage of the lines cannot exceed 13,000\u201314,000 passengers/hour (on the busiest stretches), at least not in the next 20 years, whilst the system's capacity maxes out at 20,000 passengers/hour. The possibility of conversion to a conventional metro and easy connections to existing tram lines are, according to the supporters, further arguments in favor of light rail.\nThere are certain speculations that the project would be abandoned in favor of a conventional metro, if Belgrade's government were to change.\nLines.\nBelgrade's Master plan for the year 2021 envisions three lines operating within the system. The strict timeline that saw the construction of the third line commencing as soon as 2012 has now been abandoned and the only relatively fixed date has the year 2008 as the dead-line for the beginning of Phase 0 of construction.\nLine 1.\n Line 1 \u2013 Central line () is to be constructed first. The pre-feasibility study has it denoted as \"primary\". The overall length of the line should be 12,5\u00a0km, with 20 stations (12 overground, 8 underground). The line is intended to start from the Tvorni\u010dka St. in &lt;a href=\"Zemun\"&gt;Zemun&lt;/a&gt;, headed towards the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Novi%20Beograd\"&gt;Novi Beograd&lt;/a&gt;, and further east, towards the river &lt;a href=\"Sava\"&gt;Sava&lt;/a&gt;. After crossing the river over a designated bridge constructed adjacent to the existing one (&lt;a href=\"Brankov%20most\"&gt;Brankov most&lt;/a&gt;) the line is then planned to enter deep-level tunnels, calling at &lt;a href=\"Republic%20Square%20%28Belgrade%29\"&gt;Square of the Republic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nikola%20Pa%C5%A1i%C4%87%20Square\"&gt;Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 Square&lt;/a&gt; before moving on in the direction of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Belgrade%20Faculty%20of%20Law\"&gt;University of Belgrade Faculty of Law&lt;/a&gt;. From that station onwards, the line should then resurface and would follow the &lt;a href=\"Bulevar%20Kralja%20Aleksandra\"&gt;Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra&lt;/a&gt; St. terminating at its intersection with Ustani\u010dka St. The full list of stations is as follows:\nLine 2.\n Line 2 \u2013 Vra\u010dar line () would be sharing a station with Line 1 \u2013 The Faculty of Law/Po\u0161ta station. From here it would work its way to &lt;a href=\"Slavija%20%28Belgrade%29\"&gt;Slavija&lt;/a&gt; and Prokop (Belgrade's future Main train station) in deep-level tunnels. It would then proceed towards &lt;a href=\"Belgrade%20Fair\"&gt;Belgrade Fair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Careva%20%C4%86uprija%23Hippodrome\"&gt;Hipodrom&lt;/a&gt;. Its stations are expected to be:\nLine 3.\n Line 3 \u2013 Sava line () would depart from &lt;a href=\"Novi%20Beograd\"&gt;Novi Beograd&lt;/a&gt; where it's supposed to share the Proleterske solidarnosti station with Central line, headed for Novi Beograd mainline train station. Afterwards it would proceed across the Sava (in an, as yet, undetermined way, most like it will share a road bridge planned for constructions across the &lt;a href=\"Ada%20Ciganlija\"&gt;Ada&lt;/a&gt;) and would terminate at &lt;a href=\"Banovo%20Brdo\"&gt;Banovo Brdo&lt;/a&gt;.
