    "text": "Church of Scientology Celebrity Centres are &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Scientology\"&gt;Scientology churches&lt;/a&gt; that are open to the general public but are intended mostly for \"artists, politicians, leaders of industry, and sports figures\".\nThe Celebrity Centre International was established in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, in 1969 by Yvonne Gillham, a &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Org\"&gt;Sea Org&lt;/a&gt; member who worked with &lt;a href=\"L.%20Ron%20Hubbard\"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, other centres have been established in &lt;a href=\"D%C3%BCsseldorf\"&gt;D\u00fcsseldorf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nashville\"&gt;Nashville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of other cities around the world. Eight centres are open as of March, 2020.\nCritics of Scientology point to Hubbard's launch of \"Project Celebrity\" in 1955 to recruit celebrities into the church, and that the centres were established as an extension of this initial purpose. The church denies the existence of a policy to recruit high-ranking celebrities.\nViolent incident.\nOn November 23, 2008, Mario Majorski arrived at the Los Angeles Celebrity Centre wielding dual &lt;a href=\"samurai%20sword\"&gt;samurai sword&lt;/a&gt;s and threatening to injure people. Majorski was shot by Celebrity Centre security guards, and was later pronounced dead at &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County-USC%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. Police regard the guards' actions as justifiable. Majorski was a &lt;a href=\"Scientologist\"&gt;Scientologist&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1990s; however, he left the group fifteen years prior to the incident, according to church spokesperson &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Davis%20%28Scientology%29\"&gt;Tommy Davis&lt;/a&gt;. When he was still a member of the church, Majorski had filed lawsuits, later dismissed, against &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Jolyon%20West\"&gt;Louis West&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatrist who was critical of Scientology."
