    "text": "Permanent standard time refers to the year-round observation of &lt;a href=\"standard%20time\"&gt;standard time&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, permanent daylight saving time refers to the year-round observation of &lt;a href=\"daylight%20saving%20time\"&gt;daylight saving time&lt;/a&gt; (DST). Both permanent standard time and permanent DST eliminate the practice of biannual clock changes, specifically the advancement of clocks by one hour from standard time to DST in &lt;a href=\"Spring%20%28season%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; (commonly called \"spring forward\") and the retraction of clocks by one hour from DST to standard time in &lt;a href=\"Autumn\"&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt; (\"fall back\"). In the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arizona\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Navajo%20Nation\"&gt;Navajo Nation&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, and all &lt;a href=\"Territories_of_the_United_States%23Permanently_inhabited_territories\"&gt;permanently inhabited territories&lt;/a&gt; observe permanent standard time. Observation of permanent DST is forbidden by the &lt;a href=\"Uniform%20Time%20Act\"&gt;Uniform Time Act&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Uniform Time Act of 1966 formalized the specification of &lt;a href=\"time%20zone\"&gt;time zone&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20saving%20time%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;dates of DST observation&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. Prior to this law, time zones and DST observation in America were independent and erratic across states and cities. The law requires states to change clocks biannually between standard time and DST on federally mandated dates, and it permits states to opt out of DST observation altogether and remain on permanent standard time. It does not permit observation of permanent DST.\nStudies have shown the semi-annual clock changes result in sleep disturbances, ultimately resulting in more health problems and traffic accidents. Legislators in 25 states have attempted to switch to either permanent standard time or permanent DST. Currently more states are pursuing permanent DST.\nPermanent standard time.\nPrior to the introduction of DST, all American states observed permanent Standard Time. Presently in the US, Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation), Hawaii, and all permanently inhabited territories (&lt;a href=\"American%20Samoa\"&gt;American Samoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Mariana%20Islands\"&gt;Northern Mariana Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands\"&gt;Virgin Islands&lt;/a&gt;) observe permanent standard time. A number of states have proposed bills to restore observation of permanent standard time, but few have yet to gain ground.\nPossible benefits and disadvantages.\nPermanent standard time is considered by &lt;a href=\"Circadian%20rhythm\"&gt;circadian health&lt;/a&gt; researchers and &lt;a href=\"safety\"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; experts worldwide to be the best option for health, safety, schools, and economy, including the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Sleep%20Medicine\"&gt;American Academy of Sleep Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"National%20Sleep%20Foundation\"&gt;National Sleep Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20College%20of%20Chest%20Physicians\"&gt;American College of Chest Physicians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"National%20Safety%20Council\"&gt;National Safety Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20College%20of%20Occupational%20and%20Environmental%20Medicine\"&gt;American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Sleep%20Society\"&gt;Canadian Sleep Society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"World%20Sleep%20Day\"&gt;World Sleep Society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Society%20for%20Research%20on%20Biological%20Rhythms\"&gt;Society for Research on Biological Rhythms&lt;/a&gt;, and several state sleep societies. Permanent standard time is supported by advocates for school children, including the &lt;a href=\"Parent%E2%80%93teacher_association%23United_States\"&gt;National PTA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"National%20Education%20Association\"&gt;National Education Association&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20Federation%20of%20Teachers\"&gt;American Federation of Teachers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"National%20School%20Boards%20Association\"&gt;National School Boards Association&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Start%20School%20Later\"&gt;Start School Later&lt;/a&gt;. They cite both the health benefits of circadian alignment, and the safety advantages regarding morning commutes.\nIt is supported by certain religious communities, such as &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20Judaism\"&gt;Orthodox Jews&lt;/a&gt;, whose daily prayers and other customs are synchronized with times of sunrise and sunset.\nIt is supported by &lt;a href=\"Environmentalism\"&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt; evidence, owing to evidence that DST observation increases driving, morning heating, and evening air conditioning, which all in turn increase energy consumption and pollution.\nPermanent daylight saving time.\nA change in federal law would be necessary to allow states to observe DST permanently all year. A number of states have pursued state bills, resolutions, and referendums to indicate intention to observe permanent DST if federal law would permit it.\nIn 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, Florida &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Rubio\"&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt; introduced to Congress the \"&lt;a href=\"Sunshine%20Protection%20Act\"&gt;Sunshine Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;\", a bill to permit states to observe permanent DST. The bill has achieved referral to committee, but it has yet to receive a hearing. Also in 2021, Florida Republican Representative &lt;a href=\"Vern%20Buchanan\"&gt;Vern Buchanan&lt;/a&gt; introduced a daylight saving time for the whole country, by changing everyone's time zone forward by an hour (Eastern Time would become permanently UTC-0400 instead of UTC-0500). That bill also allowed states to opt out under certain conditions.\nAs a work-around to the Uniform Time Act's prohibition on permanent DST, a bloc of states in New England has proposed a statutory move from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;Eastern Time Zone&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;Atlantic Time Zone&lt;/a&gt; (Atlantic Time being one hour ahead of Eastern Time), and then abolishing biannual clock changes. If approved by the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt;, such a move would effectively put these states on permanent DST without needing to await amendment to the Uniform Time Act by Congress. Similarly, on the West Coast, Washington state passed both a bill for permanent DST (which again cannot be enacted without change to federal law by Congress) and an alternative bill to move the state's official observation from the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;Pacific Time Zone&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;Mountain Time Zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nPossible benefits and disadvantages.\nA meta-analysis by &lt;a href=\"Rutgers\"&gt;Rutgers&lt;/a&gt; researchers found that Permanent DST would eliminate 171 pedestrian fatalities (a 13% reduction) per year. Researchers warn however that the human body \"never adjusts\" to DST, and that permanent observation of DST would result in \"permanent &lt;a href=\"Delayed%20sleep%20phase%20disorder\"&gt;social jet lag&lt;/a&gt;\". Experts such as &lt;a href=\"Till%20Roenneberg\"&gt;Till Roenneberg&lt;/a&gt; argue that evidence from extreme edges of time zones, extensions of DST, and permanent observation of DST demonstrate this phenomenon \"significantly\" increases rates of disease and accidents, and lowers productivity and wages. In 2018, the &lt;a href=\"European%20Sleep%20Research%20Society\"&gt;European Sleep Research Society&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"European%20Biological%20Rhythms%20Society\"&gt;European Biological Rhythms Society&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Society%20for%20Research%20on%20Biological%20Rhythms\"&gt;Society for Research on Biological Rhythms (SRBR)&lt;/a&gt; released a joint statement to the EU Commission on DST in opposition to permanent DST and in support of permanent standard time. The SRBR followed with its own more comprehensive statement and set of materials supporting the same position in 2019. In August 2020, the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Sleep%20Medicine\"&gt;American Academy of Sleep Medicine&lt;/a&gt; provided a statement on why they oppose permanent daylight saving time and favor permanent standard time.\nMedical experts for years have been citing health risks associated with the \"Spring Forward\", including &lt;a href=\"Daliah%20Wachs\"&gt;Daliah Wachs&lt;/a&gt; and Paul Kalekas, and in a petition, they took the temperature of what society would want in terms of ending the time change, and close to 200,000 signed asking for an end to biannual time changes. They and other physicians are supporting the &lt;a href=\"Hashtag\"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;SickofSpringForward and #FinishedWithFallBack campaign.\nSeasonal observation of DST was first enacted in the US during World Wars I and II, as an attempt to conserve fuel. The practice was unpopular and promptly repealed after each war; however, lobbyists from the petroleum industry lobbied to restore DST, as they had noticed it actually increased fuel consumption. Petroleum lobbyists joined with lobbyists from golf and candy corporations in the 1980s to form the National Daylight Saving Time Coalition, and they have twice since succeeded in extending the length of DST's observation from six months to seven in 1986, and again to eight months in 2005. The observation of DST has also been found to increase residential energy costs and pollution costs by several million dollars per year.\nPrevious observation of year-round daylight saving time.\nPermanent DST in the US was briefly enacted by president &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; in 1974, in response to the &lt;a href=\"1973%20oil%20crisis\"&gt;1973 oil crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The proposal was initially supported by an estimated 79% of the public; that support dropped to 42% after its first winter, owing to the harshness of dark winter mornings that permanent DST creates. In the state of Florida alone, at least six school children were killed by motorists due to the dark mornings created by the new law. The new permanent DST law was retracted within the year."
