He was promoted to &lt;a href=\"rear%20admiral\"&gt;rear admiral&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April 1901.\nPolitical career.\nOn 6 May 1902, Abaza was appointed to the retinue of &lt;a href=\"Tsar\"&gt;Tsar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Nicholas II&lt;/a&gt;. On 10 November 1902 he became the Assistant Chief of the Ministry of Merchant Shipping and Ports and served as commander of the training detachment of the Naval Cadet Corps. He became acting deputy head of the ministry on 20 January 1903.\nOn 10 October 1903, Abaza was appointed manager of the Special Committee for the Affairs of the Far East. In this position, he enjoyed the right of a personal report to Nicholas II. Along with his cousin, &lt;a href=\"Aleksandr%20Mikhailovich%20Bezobrazov\"&gt;Aleksandr Mikhailovich Bezobrazov&lt;/a&gt;, who was a &lt;a href=\"state%20secretary\"&gt;state secretary&lt;/a&gt;, he had a great influence on diplomatic work with Japan, actually pushing aside the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20of%20the%20Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt;. The so-called \"Bezobrazov clique\" \u2014 made up of Abaza, Bezobrazov, and Admiral &lt;a href=\"Yevgeni%20Ivanovich%20Alekseyev\"&gt;Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 was convinced of Japan's weakness and negotiated with Japan as if Russia was in a position of strength; according to then-Finance Minister &lt;a href=\"Sergei%20Witte\"&gt;Sergei Witte&lt;/a&gt;, a note Abaza presented to Nicholas II in March 1903 actually decided the question of starting a war with Japan. The \"Bezobrazov clique\" in this way played a predominant role in triggering the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Japanese%20War\"&gt;Russo-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt; in February 1904.\nWith the war underway, Abaza traveled incognito to Western Europe in the autumn of 1904 to organize the purchase through third parties of seven South American cruisers \u2014 the armored cruisers , , , from &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and the armored cruisers and and &lt;a href=\"protected%20cruiser\"&gt;protected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; from Chile \u2013 so that Russia could use them in military operations against Japan. The mission ended in failure.\nOn 13 June 1905, Abaza was dismissed from the post of manager of the Special Committee for the Far East and the committee was abolished. Although this left him in the tsar's retinue and in the Guards Naval Crew, his political influence on state affairs came to an end.\nSubsequently, after the Russo-Japanese War culminated in Russia's defeat, Abaza drew up another note justifying the behavior of the 'Bezobrazov clique\" leading up to the war.\nThe Russian government official and politician &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Gurko\"&gt;Vladimir Gurko&lt;/a&gt;, a contemporary of Abaza, described him as follows:\nBeing a &lt;a href=\"Sailor\"&gt;seaman&lt;/a&gt; by service, he accidentally fell in with the heads of Russian foreign policy, and boldly took upon himself the resolution of extremely complex and delicate international issues, without the slightest preparation for that, relying only on the possibility of direct relations with [Tsar Nicholas II at] &lt;a href=\"Tsarskoye%20Selo\"&gt;Tsarskoye Selo&lt;/a&gt; ...\nAbaza died either in 1915 or on 3 February 1917.\nPersonal life.\nAbaza married Natalia Feodorovna, \"nee\" Vasilchikova, who died in France sometime after 1930. They had six children: Alexander, born 12 March 1887, who reached the rank of captain second rank in the Imperial Russian Navy and died in &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;, France, in September 1943; Vladimir; Leo, born 18 June 1897; Elizaveta, who was born in 1892 and died in 1941 in &lt;a href=\"Saratov\"&gt;Saratov&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;; Elena, born 4 June 1894; and Andrey, who was born in 1903 and died in 1941 in a &lt;a href=\"Sevvostlag\"&gt;Sevvostlag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forced%20labor%20camp\"&gt;forced labor camp&lt;/a&gt; in the Soviet Union."
