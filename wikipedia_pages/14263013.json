    "text": "Spacetime topology is the &lt;a href=\"Topological%20space\"&gt;topological structure&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"spacetime\"&gt;spacetime&lt;/a&gt;, a topic studied primarily in &lt;a href=\"general%20relativity\"&gt;general relativity&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=\"physical%20theory\"&gt;physical theory&lt;/a&gt; models &lt;a href=\"gravitation\"&gt;gravitation&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"curvature\"&gt;curvature&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"four%20dimensional\"&gt;four dimensional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pseudo-Riemannian_manifold%23Lorentzian_manifold\"&gt;Lorentzian manifold&lt;/a&gt; (a spacetime) and the concepts of &lt;a href=\"topology\"&gt;topology&lt;/a&gt; thus become important in analysing local as well as global aspects of spacetime. The study of spacetime topology is especially important in &lt;a href=\"physical%20cosmology\"&gt;physical cosmology&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of topology.\nThere are two main types of topology for a spacetime \"M\".\nManifold topology.\nAs with any manifold, a spacetime possesses a natural &lt;a href=\"manifold\"&gt;manifold&lt;/a&gt; topology. Here the &lt;a href=\"open%20set\"&gt;open set&lt;/a&gt;s are the image of open sets in formula_1.\nPath or Zeeman topology.\n\"Definition\": The topology formula_2 in which a subset formula_3 is &lt;a href=\"open%20%28topology%29\"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; if for every &lt;a href=\"timelike%20curve\"&gt;timelike curve&lt;/a&gt; formula_4 there is a set formula_5 in the manifold topology such that formula_6.\nIt is the finest topology which induces the same topology as formula_7 does on timelike curves.\nProperties.\nStrictly &lt;a href=\"finer%20topology\"&gt;finer&lt;/a&gt; than the manifold topology. It is therefore &lt;a href=\"Hausdorff%20space\"&gt;Hausdorff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Separable%20%28topology%29\"&gt;separable&lt;/a&gt; but not &lt;a href=\"Locally%20compact%20space\"&gt;locally compact&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Base%20%28topology%29\"&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; for the topology is sets of the form formula_8 for some point formula_9 and some convex normal neighbourhood formula_10.\n(formula_11 denote the &lt;a href=\"Causal%20structure%23Causal%20structure\"&gt;chronological past and future&lt;/a&gt;).\nAlexandrov topology.\nThe Alexandrov topology on spacetime, is the &lt;a href=\"Comparison%20of%20topologies\"&gt;coarsest topology&lt;/a&gt; such that both formula_12 and formula_13 are open for all subsets formula_3.\nHere the &lt;a href=\"Base%20%28topology%29\"&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; of open sets for the topology are sets of the form formula_15 for some points formula_16.\nThis topology coincides with the manifold topology if and only if the manifold is &lt;a href=\"Causality%20conditions%23Strongly%20causal\"&gt;strongly causal&lt;/a&gt; but it is coarser in general.\nNote that in mathematics, an &lt;a href=\"Alexandrov%20topology\"&gt;Alexandrov topology&lt;/a&gt; on a partial order is usually taken to be the coarsest topology in which only the upper sets formula_12 are required to be open. This topology goes back to &lt;a href=\"Pavel%20Alexandrov\"&gt;Pavel Alexandrov&lt;/a&gt;.\nNowadays, the correct mathematical term for the Alexandrov topology on spacetime (which goes back to &lt;a href=\"Aleksandr%20Danilovich%20Aleksandrov\"&gt;Alexandr D. Alexandrov&lt;/a&gt;) would be the interval topology, but when Kronheimer and Penrose introduced the term this difference in nomenclature was not as clear, and in physics the term Alexandrov topology remains in use."
