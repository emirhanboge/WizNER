    "text": "USS \"Stiletto\", a wooden &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;, was launched in 1885 at the &lt;a href=\"Herreshoff%20Manufacturing%20Co.\"&gt;Herreshoff Manufacturing Co.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bristol%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Bristol, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, as a private speculation. She was purchased for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; under an Act of Congress dated 3 March 1887, and entered service in July 1887, attached to the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Torpedo%20Station\"&gt;Naval Torpedo Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Newport%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Newport Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOn 10 June 1885, she raced the paddle steamer \"Mary Powell\", easily overtaking her. The next day, she beat the sailing racing yacht \"Atalanta\". \n\"Stiletto\" was the Navy's first torpedo boat capable of launching self-propelled &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es. Purchased for experimental evaluation, \"Stiletto\" was based throughout her career at Newport and often captained by Andrew Wright. During 1897, she was modified to burn fuel oil, but results of &lt;a href=\"sea%20trial\"&gt;sea trial&lt;/a&gt;s held subsequently were disappointing, and the experiment was not repeated. On 14 July 1897 she fouled steam &lt;a href=\"yacht\"&gt;yacht&lt;/a&gt; \"Nautilus\" () at &lt;a href=\"Bristol%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Bristol, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; doing minor damage to the yacht. \"Stiletto\" was struck from the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Vessel%20Register\"&gt;Navy list&lt;/a&gt; on 27 January 1911 and sold on 18 July 1911 at Newport to James F. Nolan of &lt;a href=\"East%20Boston%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;East Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"scrap\"&gt;scrap&lt;/a&gt;ping."
