    "title": "List of lingua francas",
    "text": "This is a list of lingua francas. A &lt;a href=\"lingua%20franca\"&gt;lingua franca&lt;/a&gt; is a language systematically used to make communication possible between people not sharing a &lt;a href=\"first%20language\"&gt;first language&lt;/a&gt;, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both speakers' first languages.\nExamples of lingua francas are numerous, and exist on every continent. The most utilized modern example is English, which is the current dominant lingua franca of international diplomacy, business, science, technology and aviation, but many other languages serve, or have served at different historical periods, as lingua francas in particular regions, countries, or in special contexts.\nAfrica.\nAkan.\n&lt;a href=\"Akan%20language\"&gt;Akan&lt;/a&gt; can be regarded as the main lingua franca of &lt;a href=\"Ghana\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, although mainly in the south.\nAfrikaans.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"apartheid\"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;, the South African government aimed to establish &lt;a href=\"Afrikaans\"&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/a&gt; as the primary lingua franca in South Africa and South African-controlled South-West Africa (now Namibia), although English was also in common use. Since the end of apartheid, English has been widely adopted as the sole lingua franca even though it was replaced with a new language. Many institutions that had names in English and Afrikaans have since dropped the Afrikaans names. Notable cases are &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Airways\"&gt;South African Airways&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;South African Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Namibia\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;, Afrikaans holds a more universal role than in South Africa, across ethnic groups and races and is the spoken lingua franca in the capital &lt;a href=\"Windhoek\"&gt;Windhoek&lt;/a&gt; and throughout most of central and southern Namibia. There are pockets where &lt;a href=\"German%20language%20in%20Namibia\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; is commonly spoken. English is the sole official language.\nAmazigh.\n&lt;a href=\"Berber%20languages\"&gt;Amazigh&lt;/a&gt; or Tamazight is spoken in &lt;a href=\"Maghreb\"&gt;Maghreb&lt;/a&gt;. During the rise of Amazigh dynasties like the &lt;a href=\"Almoravids\"&gt;Almoravids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Almohads\"&gt;Almohads&lt;/a&gt; between 1040 and 1500, &lt;a href=\"Berber%20languages\"&gt;Berber&lt;/a&gt; served as both the vernacular and lingua franca of Northwest Africa. Today the language is less influential due to its suppression and marginalization, and the adoption of French and Arabic by the political regimes of the Berber world as working languages. However, &lt;a href=\"Tuareg%20languages\"&gt;Tuareg&lt;/a&gt;, a branch of the &lt;a href=\"Berber%20languages\"&gt;Berber languages&lt;/a&gt;, is still playing the role of a lingua franca to some extent in some vast parts of the &lt;a href=\"Sahara%20Desert\"&gt;Sahara Desert&lt;/a&gt;, especially in southern &lt;a href=\"Algeria\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Libya\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, and northern &lt;a href=\"Mali\"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt; and western &lt;a href=\"Niger\"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;. Tamazight has become an official language of &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; in 2011. In Algeria, Tamazight has been a national language since 2002, and an official state Language in 2016.\nArabic.\nThere are more &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; speakers in Africa than Asia. It is spoken as an official language in all of the continent's &lt;a href=\"Arab%20League\"&gt;Arab League&lt;/a&gt; states. Arabic is also spoken as a trade language across the Sahara as far as the Sahel, including parts of Mali, Chad and &lt;a href=\"Borno%20State\"&gt;Borno State&lt;/a&gt; in Nigeria. &lt;a href=\"Varieties%20of%20Arabic\"&gt;Varieties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arabic-based%20pidgins\"&gt;Arabic-based pidgins&lt;/a&gt; function as the lingua francas of Sudan (&lt;a href=\"Sudanese%20Arabic\"&gt;Sudanese Arabic&lt;/a&gt;), Chad (&lt;a href=\"Chadian%20Arabic\"&gt;Chadian Arabic&lt;/a&gt;; mainly in the northern half of the country), and South Sudan (&lt;a href=\"Juba%20Arabic\"&gt;Juba Arabic&lt;/a&gt;; mainly the &lt;a href=\"Equatoria\"&gt;Equatoria region&lt;/a&gt;). Sudan has a majority of people that speak Arabic natively and minorities that speak various other languages in addition to Arabic, while native Arabic speakers are a significant minority in Chad and a very small minority in South Sudan.\nBambara.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bambara%20language\"&gt;Bambara language&lt;/a&gt; functions as the lingua franca of &lt;a href=\"Mali\"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt;, where it is spoken by 80% of the population, and 50% speak it natively. It is closely related to and mutually intelligible with the &lt;a href=\"Dyula%20language\"&gt;Dyula language&lt;/a&gt;.\nBemba.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bemba%20language\"&gt;Bemba language&lt;/a&gt; is a lingua franca in northwestern &lt;a href=\"Zambia\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;.\nDyula.\n&lt;a href=\"Dyula%20language\"&gt;Dyula&lt;/a&gt; (also spelled Dioula or Jula, and literally meaning \"trader\") is an important trade language of &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Coast\"&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/a&gt; (mainly the northern half of the country), the western half of &lt;a href=\"Burkina%20Faso\"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt;, and some neighboring areas of Mali. It is mutually intelligible with Bambara, the main language of Mali.\nEwondo.\n&lt;a href=\"Ewondo%20language\"&gt;Ewondo&lt;/a&gt; is a lingua franca used in Cameroon's &lt;a href=\"Centre%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29\"&gt;Centre Region&lt;/a&gt;, including the capital &lt;a href=\"Yaounde\"&gt;Yaounde&lt;/a&gt;, often in a pidginized form known as &lt;a href=\"Ewondo%20Populaire\"&gt;Ewondo Populaire&lt;/a&gt;. However, Cameroon is one of the African countries where French is most widely spread, and Ewondo's status may be coming under threat. Ewondo is mutually intelligible with &lt;a href=\"Fang%20language\"&gt;Fang&lt;/a&gt;, which is the main language of the neighboring &lt;a href=\"R%C3%ADo%20Muni\"&gt;R\u00edo Muni&lt;/a&gt; mainland of &lt;a href=\"Equatorial%20Guinea\"&gt;Equatorial Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a major language of &lt;a href=\"Gabon\"&gt;Gabon&lt;/a&gt;.\nFanagalo.\n&lt;a href=\"Fanagalo\"&gt;Fanagalo&lt;/a&gt; or Fanakalo is a &lt;a href=\"pidgin\"&gt;pidgin&lt;/a&gt; based on the &lt;a href=\"Zulu%20language\"&gt;Zulu&lt;/a&gt;, English, and &lt;a href=\"Afrikaans\"&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/a&gt; languages. It was used as a lingua franca mainly in the mining industries in South Africa, however in this role it is being increasingly eclipsed by English which is viewed as being more neutral politically.\nFon.\n&lt;a href=\"Fon%20language\"&gt;Fon&lt;/a&gt; is regarded as the lingua franca of the southern third of &lt;a href=\"Benin\"&gt;Benin&lt;/a&gt;, which is the most densely populated area and includes the largest cities and the national capital.\nFula.\n&lt;a href=\"Fula%20language\"&gt;Fula&lt;/a&gt; ( \"or\" Pulaar \"or\" Pular\", depending on the region\"; ) the language of the &lt;a href=\"Fula%20people\"&gt;Fula people&lt;/a&gt; or Fulani (; ) and associated groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Toucouleur%20people\"&gt;Toucouleur&lt;/a&gt;. Fula is spoken in all countries directly south of the Sahara (such as &lt;a href=\"Cameroon\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chad\"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Niger\"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;, Mali...). It is spoken mainly by Fula people, but is also used as a lingua franca by several populations of various origin, throughout Western Africa. One region where it is particularly important as a link language is the &lt;a href=\"Adamawa%20Plateau\"&gt;Adamawa Plateau&lt;/a&gt; of northern Cameroon, which, although largely populated by non-Fula people, was united and ruled by Fula conquerors prior to colonial rule. Fula is also the main lingua franca of the &lt;a href=\"Sahel%20Region\"&gt;Sahel Region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Burkina%20Faso\"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt;.\nHausa.\n&lt;a href=\"Hausa%20language\"&gt;Hausa&lt;/a&gt; is widely spoken through Nigeria and Niger and recognised in neighbouring states such as &lt;a href=\"Ghana\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benin\"&gt;Benin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cameroon\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for this is that Hausa people used to be traders who led caravans with goods (cotton, leather, slaves, food crops etc.) through the whole West African region, from the Niger Delta to the Atlantic shores at the very west edge of Africa. They also reached North African states through Trans-Saharan routes. Thus trade deals in &lt;a href=\"Timbuktu\"&gt;Timbuktu&lt;/a&gt; in modern Mali, &lt;a href=\"Agadez\"&gt;Agadez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghat%2C%20Libya\"&gt;Ghat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fes%2C%20Morocco\"&gt;Fez&lt;/a&gt; in Northern Africa, and other trade centers were often concluded in Hausa. Today, Hausa is the most widely spoken language in West Africa; although its speakers are mainly concentrated in the traditional Hausa heartland, it functions as the lingua franca of Nigeria's multilingual &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Belt\"&gt;Middle Belt&lt;/a&gt;, including the capital of &lt;a href=\"Abuja\"&gt;Abuja&lt;/a&gt;, and is also widely spoken in understood in other countries, especially northern Ghana, both because of Hausa settlement in other areas, and the influence of Hausa media.\nKanuri.\n&lt;a href=\"Kanuri%20language\"&gt;Kanuri&lt;/a&gt; has historically been an important lingua franca around the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Chad\"&gt;Lake Chad&lt;/a&gt; region due to its association with the powerful &lt;a href=\"Kanem-Borno\"&gt;Kanem-Borno&lt;/a&gt; empire. However, since the creation of the modern nation-states of Nigeria and Niger, it has declined somewhat in prestige, due to the expansion of the populous Hausa language.\nKituba.\nA pidgin based on the &lt;a href=\"Kongo%20language\"&gt;Kongo language&lt;/a&gt; which originated when Belgian colonists enlisted West African labor to help build a local railroad, &lt;a href=\"Kituba%20language\"&gt;Kituba&lt;/a&gt; is used in the southern half of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kwilu%20province\"&gt;Kwilu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kwango%20province\"&gt;Kwango&lt;/a&gt; provinces in the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;.\nKrio.\n&lt;a href=\"Krio%20language\"&gt;Krio&lt;/a&gt; is the most widely spoken language throughout &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Leone\"&gt;Sierra Leone&lt;/a&gt; even though its native speakers, the &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Leone%20Creole%20people\"&gt;Sierra Leone Creole people&lt;/a&gt; or Krios (a community of about 300,000 descendants of formerly enslaved people from the &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies\"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt;, United States and Britain), make up only about 5% of the country's population. The Krio language unites all the different ethnic groups, especially in their trade and interaction with each other. Krio is also spoken in &lt;a href=\"The%20Gambia\"&gt;The Gambia&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiberian Kreyol.\nAn English creole, &lt;a href=\"Liberian%20Kreyol%20language\"&gt;Liberian Kreyol&lt;/a&gt; is spoken by most of the population of &lt;a href=\"Liberia\"&gt;Liberia&lt;/a&gt; as a second language, and is used as the main interethnic language given that no ethnic group is particularly numerous.\nLingala.\n&lt;a href=\"Lingala%20language\"&gt;Lingala&lt;/a&gt; is used by over 10 million speakers throughout the northwestern part of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; and a large part of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to some degree in Angola and the Central African Republic, although it has only about two million native speakers. Its status is comparable to that of Swahili in eastern Africa.\nBetween 1880 and 1900, the colonial administration, in need of a common language for the region, adopted a simplified form of &lt;a href=\"Bangi%20language\"&gt;Bobangi&lt;/a&gt;, the language of the &lt;a href=\"Ngala%20%28people%29\"&gt;Bangala&lt;/a&gt; people, which became Lingala. Spoken Lingala has many loanwords from French, inflected with Lingala affixes.\nManding.\nThe largely interintelligible &lt;a href=\"Manding%20languages\"&gt;Manding languages&lt;/a&gt; of West Africa serve as lingua francas in various places. For instance &lt;a href=\"Bambara%20language\"&gt;Bambara&lt;/a&gt; is the most widely spoken language in &lt;a href=\"Mali\"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jula%20language\"&gt;Jula&lt;/a&gt; (almost the same as Bambara) is commonly used in western &lt;a href=\"Burkina%20Faso\"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B4te%20d%27Ivoire\"&gt;C\u00f4te d'Ivoire&lt;/a&gt;; these two varieties are especially closely related and mutually intelligible, whereas other varieties may present more difficulties. Manding languages have long been used in regional commerce, so much so that the word for trader, \"jula\", was applied to the language currently known by the same name. Other varieties of Manding are used in several other countries, such as &lt;a href=\"Guinea\"&gt;Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Gambia\"&gt;The Gambia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Senegal\"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;.\nMende.\n&lt;a href=\"Mende%20language\"&gt;Mende&lt;/a&gt; is a lingua franca of the southern half of &lt;a href=\"Sierra%20Leone\"&gt;Sierra Leone&lt;/a&gt;, although almost the entire population speaks the &lt;a href=\"Krio%20language\"&gt;Krio language&lt;/a&gt;.\nNgambay.\n&lt;a href=\"Ngambay%20language\"&gt;Ngambay&lt;/a&gt; is an important lingua franca of southwestern &lt;a href=\"Chad\"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, covering areas where &lt;a href=\"Chadian%20Arabic\"&gt;Chadian Arabic&lt;/a&gt; is not as widespread. It is the most important of the &lt;a href=\"Sara%20languages\"&gt;Sara languages&lt;/a&gt; and may be used by speakers of other varieties.\nNyanja.\n&lt;a href=\"Town%20Nyanja\"&gt;Town Nyanja&lt;/a&gt; is the lingua franca of &lt;a href=\"Lusaka\"&gt;Lusaka&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href=\"Zambia\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;. Nyanja is also the main language of &lt;a href=\"Malawi\"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt;, where it is known as &lt;a href=\"Chewa%20language\"&gt;Chewa&lt;/a&gt;.\nSango.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sango%20language\"&gt;Sango language&lt;/a&gt; is a lingua franca developed for intertribal trading in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic\"&gt;Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt;. It is based on the Northern &lt;a href=\"Ngbandi%20language\"&gt;Ngbandi language&lt;/a&gt; spoken by the Sango people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo but with a large vocabulary of French loan words. It has now been institutionalised as an official language of the Central African Republic.\nSar.\n&lt;a href=\"Sar%20language\"&gt;Sar&lt;/a&gt; is the lingua franca of the city of &lt;a href=\"Sarh\"&gt;Sarh&lt;/a&gt; in Chad and surrounding areas, although not as widespread as Ngambay.\nSwahili.\n&lt;a href=\"Swahili%20language\"&gt;Swahili&lt;/a&gt;, known as Kiswahili to its speakers, is used throughout large parts of East Africa and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo as a lingua franca, despite being the mother tongue of &lt;a href=\"Swahili%20people\"&gt;a relatively small ethnic group&lt;/a&gt; on the East African coast and nearby islands in the Indian Ocean. Swahili is also one of the working &lt;a href=\"languages%20of%20the%20African%20Union\"&gt;languages of the African Union&lt;/a&gt; and officially recognised as a of the &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Community\"&gt;East African Community&lt;/a&gt;. At least as early as the late 18th century, Swahili was used along trading and slave routes that extended west across Lake Tanganyika and into the present-day &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;. Swahili rose in prominence throughout the colonial era, and has become the predominant African language of &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. Some ethnic groups now speak Swahili more often than their mother tongues, and many, especially in urban areas, choose to raise their children with Swahili as their first language, leading to the possibility that several smaller East African languages will fade away as Swahili transitions from being a regional lingua franca to a regional first language.\nIt has official status as a national language in DR Congo, Tanzania and Kenya, and symbolic official status (understood but not widely spoken) in Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. It is the first language of education in Tanzania and in much of eastern Congo. It is also the auxiliary language to be in the proposed &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Federation\"&gt;East African Federation&lt;/a&gt;.\nTemne.\n&lt;a href=\"Temne%20language\"&gt;Temne&lt;/a&gt; is a lingua franca of the northern half of Sierra Leone, although almost the entire population speaks the &lt;a href=\"Krio%20language\"&gt;Krio language&lt;/a&gt;.\nWest African Pidgin English.\n&lt;a href=\"West%20African%20Pidgin%20English\"&gt;West African Pidgin English&lt;/a&gt; is used by an estimated 75 million people across coastal West Africa, mainly as a second language. It is used in &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, where it functions as something close to a national lingua franca, as well as &lt;a href=\"Ghana\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bioko\"&gt;Bioko&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href=\"Equatorial%20Guinea\"&gt;Equatorial Guinea&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Pichinglis\"&gt;Pichinglis&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Cameroon\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;, mainly the two anglophone regions. Closely related languages are used as lingua francas in Sierra Leone and Liberia.\nWolof.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolof%20language\"&gt;Wolof&lt;/a&gt; is a widely spoken lingua franca of Senegal and The Gambia (especially the capital, Banjul). It is the native language of approximately 5 million &lt;a href=\"Wolof%20people\"&gt;Wolof people&lt;/a&gt; in Senegal, and is spoken as a second language by an equal number.\nAsia.\nAkkadian.\nIn the Middle East, from around 2600BC to 1500BC, forms of &lt;a href=\"Akkadian%20language\"&gt;Akkadian&lt;/a&gt; were the universally recognized language. It was used throughout the Akkadian empire as well as internationally as a diplomatic language \u2013 for example between Egypt and Babylon \u2013 well after the fall of the Akkadian empire itself and even while Aramaic was more common in Babylon.\nArabic.\n&lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;, the native language of the &lt;a href=\"Arabs\"&gt;Arabs&lt;/a&gt;, who originally came from the &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Arabian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, became the lingua franca of the &lt;a href=\"Caliphate\"&gt;Islamic (Arab) Empire&lt;/a&gt; (from CE 733 \u2013 1492), which at its greatest extent was bordered by China and &lt;a href=\"North%20India\"&gt;Northern India&lt;/a&gt;, Central Asia, &lt;a href=\"Persian%20Empire\"&gt;Persia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Asia%20Minor\"&gt;Asia Minor&lt;/a&gt;, the Middle East, North Africa, France and Portugal.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20Golden%20Age\"&gt;Islamic Golden Age&lt;/a&gt; (around CE 1200), Arabic was the language of science and diplomacy. Arabic loanwords are found in many languages, including &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Arabic%20loanwords%20in%20English\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hindustani%20language\"&gt;Hindustani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Somali%20language\"&gt;Somali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20influence%20on%20the%20Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Portuguese%20words%20of%20Arabic%20origin\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swahili%20language\"&gt;Swahili&lt;/a&gt;. In Iberia, this is a legacy of the &lt;a href=\"Al-Andalus\"&gt;Al-Andalus&lt;/a&gt; period. Additionally, Arabic was used by people neighbouring the Islamic Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Arabic%20script\"&gt;Arabic script&lt;/a&gt; was adopted by many other languages such as &lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt;, Persian, &lt;a href=\"Swahili%20language\"&gt;Swahili&lt;/a&gt; (changed to Latin in the late 19th century), &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; (switched to Latin script in 1928), and &lt;a href=\"Somali%20language\"&gt;Somali&lt;/a&gt; (changed to Latin in 1972). Arabic became the lingua franca of these regions not simply because of commerce or diplomacy, but also on religious grounds since Arabic is the language of the &lt;a href=\"Qur%27an\"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt;, Islam's &lt;a href=\"holy%20book\"&gt;holy book&lt;/a&gt;, sacred to Muslims. Arabic remains the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20official%20languages%23Official%20languages%20of%20sovereign%20countries%2C%20wholly%20or%20partly\"&gt;lingua franca for 23 countries&lt;/a&gt; (25 with Palestine and Western Sahara), in the Middle East, North Africa, Horn of Africa, in addition to &lt;a href=\"Chad\"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eritrea\"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a few language script conversions from Arabic to Latin as just described, Arabic is the second most widely used alphabetic system in the world after Latin. Arabic script is/has been used in languages including &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20Afrikaans\"&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijani%20language\"&gt;Azeri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arebica\"&gt;Bosnian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20language\"&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hausa%20language\"&gt;Hausa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kashmiri%20language\"&gt;Kashmiri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kazakh%20language\"&gt;Kazakh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdish%20language\"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kyrgyz%20language\"&gt;Kyrgyz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malay%20Language\"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morisco\"&gt;Morisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pashto%20language\"&gt;Pashto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Punjabi%20language\"&gt;Punjabi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sindhi%20language\"&gt;Sindhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Somali%20language\"&gt;Somali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tatar%20language\"&gt;Tatar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkmen%20language\"&gt;Turkmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Urdu%20language\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uyghur%20language\"&gt;Uyghur&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Uzbek%20language\"&gt;Uzbek&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20languages%20by%20number%20of%20native%20speakers%23More%20than%20100%20million%20native%20speakers\"&gt;Encarta&lt;/a&gt;\", which classified Chinese as a single language, Arabic is the second largest native language. Used by more than a billion Muslims around the world, it is also one of the six &lt;a href=\"official%20languages%20of%20the%20United%20Nations\"&gt;official languages of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;.\nAramaic.\n&lt;a href=\"Aramaic%20language\"&gt;Aramaic&lt;/a&gt; was the native language of the &lt;a href=\"Aramaeans\"&gt;Aramaeans&lt;/a&gt; and became the lingua franca of the &lt;a href=\"Assyrian%20Empire\"&gt;Assyrian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the western provinces of the &lt;a href=\"Persian%20Empire\"&gt;Persian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and was adopted by conquered peoples such as the Hebrews. A dialect of Old Aramaic developed into the literary language &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20language\"&gt;Syriac&lt;/a&gt;. The Syriacs, such as the &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20flag\"&gt;Syriac-Aramaeans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Assyrian%20people\"&gt;Assyrians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chaldean%20Christians\"&gt;Chaldean Christians&lt;/a&gt;, continued the use of Aramaic which ultimately evolved into the &lt;a href=\"Neo-Aramaic\"&gt;Neo-Aramaic&lt;/a&gt; dialects of the Middle East.\nAzerbaijani.\nAzerbaijani language served as a lingua franca in &lt;a href=\"Transcaucasia\"&gt;Transcaucasia&lt;/a&gt; (except the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast), &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Dagestan\"&gt;Southern Daghestan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Anatolia\"&gt;Eastern Anatolia&lt;/a&gt;, and all Iran including &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan%20%28Iran%29\"&gt;Iranian Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; from the 16th century to the early 20th century. Its role has now been taken over by Russian in the North Caucasus and by the official languages of the various independent states of the South Caucasus.\nBengali.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20language\"&gt;Bengali language&lt;/a&gt; acts as a lingua franca for the entire &lt;a href=\"Bengal\"&gt;Bengal&lt;/a&gt; region (&lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;). While there are other Bengali \u201cdialects\u201d spoken throughout Bengal that are not necessarily mutually intelligible with Standard Bengali and &lt;a href=\"Chittagonian%20language\"&gt;Chittagongian&lt;/a&gt; of the region.\nChinese.\nUntil the early 20th century, &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Chinese\"&gt;Classical Chinese&lt;/a&gt; served as both the written lingua franca and the diplomatic language in &lt;a href=\"Far%20East%20Asia\"&gt;Far East Asia&lt;/a&gt; including China, &lt;a href=\"Mongolia\"&gt;Mongolia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, Japan, Taiwan, the &lt;a href=\"Ry%C5%ABky%C5%AB%20Kingdom\"&gt;Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;. In the early 20th century, &lt;a href=\"vernacular%20written%20Chinese\"&gt;vernacular written Chinese&lt;/a&gt; replaced Classical Chinese within China as both the written and spoken lingua franca for speakers of different Chinese dialects, and because of the declining power and cultural influence of China in East Asia, English has since replaced Classical Chinese as the lingua franca in East Asia. Today, &lt;a href=\"Mandarin%20Chinese\"&gt;Mandarin Chinese&lt;/a&gt; is the lingua franca of &lt;a href=\"mainland%20China\"&gt;mainland China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, which are home to many mutually unintelligible &lt;a href=\"varieties%20of%20Chinese\"&gt;varieties of Chinese&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a significant (though not exclusive) presence among various &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20diaspora\"&gt;Chinese diaspora&lt;/a&gt; communities, particularly in Southeast Asia.\nHebrew.\nThroughout the centuries of Jewish exile, &lt;a href=\"Hebrew\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; has served the Jewish people as a lingua franca; allowing Jews from different areas of the world to communicate effectively with one another. This was particularly valuable for cross-culture mercantile trading that became one of the default occupations held by Jews in exilic times. Without the need for translators, documents could easily be written up to convey significant legal trade information. Among early Zionists, a newly reconstructed form of Hebrew served as a common language between Jews from nations as diverse as Poland and Yemen. In modern Israel, Hebrew is the commonly accepted language of administration and trade, even among &lt;a href=\"Israeli-Arabs\"&gt;Israeli-Arabs&lt;/a&gt; whose mother-tongue remains &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;.\nHindustani.\n&lt;a href=\"Hindustani%20language\"&gt;Hindustani&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt;, is commonly spoken in northern part of India and Pakistan. It encompasses two &lt;a href=\"standard%20language\"&gt;standardized&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Register%20%28sociolinguistics%29\"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;s, Hindi and Urdu, as well as several &lt;a href=\"nonstandard%20dialect\"&gt;nonstandard dialect&lt;/a&gt;s. Hindi and Urdu are constitutionally-recognized official languages in India, and Urdu is the national language and lingua franca of Pakistan. While the two registers differ in formal vocabulary (Hindi drawing from Sanskrit and Urdu drawing from Arabic and Persian) and writing system (Hindi in &lt;a href=\"Devanagari\"&gt;Devanagari&lt;/a&gt; and Urdu in &lt;a href=\"Nastaliq\"&gt;Nastaliq&lt;/a&gt;), the spoken language is largely indistinguishable and uses many loan words from English instead of Arabic or Sanskrit. This so-called \"bazaar Hindustani\" has been popularized through regional consumption of Bollywood films and is widely understood in regions where Hindi and Urdu are not indigenous, such as some parts of &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20India\"&gt;Northeast India&lt;/a&gt;.\nHindi has emerged as a lingua franca for the locals of &lt;a href=\"Arunachal%20Pradesh\"&gt;Arunachal Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, a linguistically diverse state in Northeast India. It is estimated that 90 percent of the state's population knows Hindi. A variety known as &lt;a href=\"Haflong%20Hindi\"&gt;Haflong Hindi&lt;/a&gt; is widely used in the &lt;a href=\"Dima%20Hasao%20district\"&gt;Dima Hasao district&lt;/a&gt;.\nHindi is also a lingua franca in &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Terai\"&gt;Terai&lt;/a&gt; i.e. floodplain districts of Nepal (along the Indian border), Hindi is a dominant language, though the people's mother tongues are typically &lt;a href=\"Avadhi\"&gt;Awadhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maithili%20language\"&gt;Maithili&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Bhojpuri\"&gt;Bhojpuri&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Hindustani (both Hindi-Urdu) is quite useful throughout the Middle East countries such as &lt;a href=\"UAE\"&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt; due to the export of labor from South Asia. It is quite commonly spoken among labour working populations on land and at sea throughout the Middle East.\nLao.\n&lt;a href=\"Lao%20language\"&gt;Lao&lt;/a&gt; is spoken natively by only around half of the population of &lt;a href=\"Laos\"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;, and the remainder of the population speaks unrelated languages such as &lt;a href=\"Hmong%20language\"&gt;Hmong&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Khmu%20language\"&gt;Khmu&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lao serves as the lingua franca throughout the country.\nMalay (Malaysian and Indonesian).\nIn the 15th century, during the &lt;a href=\"Malacca%20Sultanate\"&gt;Malacca Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malay%20language\"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt; was used as a lingua franca in &lt;a href=\"Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Maritime Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;, by locals, and traders and artisans that stopped at &lt;a href=\"Malacca\"&gt;Malacca&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Straits%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Straits of Malacca&lt;/a&gt;. Malay was also presumably used as a &lt;a href=\"Malay%20trade%20and%20creole%20languages\"&gt;language of trade&lt;/a&gt; among the &lt;a href=\"Tumao\"&gt;elites&lt;/a&gt; and artisans around the &lt;a href=\"Islands%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;islands&lt;/a&gt; of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. Dutch scholar, &lt;a href=\"Francois%20Valentijn\"&gt;Francois Valentijn&lt;/a&gt; (1666\u20131727) described the use of Malay in the region as being equivalent to the contemporary use of &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; and French in Europe.\n&lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20language\"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt;, a language based on traditional Malay and with which it is &lt;a href=\"mutually%20intelligible\"&gt;mutually intelligible&lt;/a&gt;, but also influenced by various languages such as Dutch, Sanskrit, &lt;a href=\"Javanese%20language\"&gt;Javanese&lt;/a&gt;, Arabic, and Portuguese, serves as a lingua franca throughout &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Timor\"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; (where it is considered a working language), areas that are home to over 700 &lt;a href=\"Languages%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;indigenous languages&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalay is currently used primarily in &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; (as &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20language\"&gt;Malaysian&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Brunei\"&gt;Brunei&lt;/a&gt;, and to a lesser extent in Singapore, parts of &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; and in the deep &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Thailand\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt; of Thailand. One of Singapore's four official languages, the Malay language or 'Bahasa Melayu' was the lingua franca for Singapore prior to the introduction of English as a working and instructional language, and remains so for the elder generation.\nNagamese.\n&lt;a href=\"Nagamese%20Creole\"&gt;Nagamese Creole&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on &lt;a href=\"Assamese%20language\"&gt;Assamese&lt;/a&gt;, is the most widely spoken language and lingua franca of the Indian state of &lt;a href=\"Nagaland\"&gt;Nagaland&lt;/a&gt;, where the indigenous &lt;a href=\"Naga%20people\"&gt;Naga people&lt;/a&gt; have several mutually unintelligible languages.\nNefamese.\n&lt;a href=\"Nefamese\"&gt;Nefamese&lt;/a&gt; is a pidgin that was once the main lingua franca of the Indian state of &lt;a href=\"Arunachal%20Pradesh\"&gt;Arunachal Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, although it has been increasingly replaced by &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt;.\nNepali.\n&lt;a href=\"Nepali%20language\"&gt;Nepali&lt;/a&gt; is the lingua franca of the many ethnic, religious and cultural communities of &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, and is also spoken in &lt;a href=\"Bhutan\"&gt;Bhutan&lt;/a&gt;, parts of India and parts of &lt;a href=\"Myanmar\"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; (Burma). It is one of 23 &lt;a href=\"official%20languages%20of%20India\"&gt;official languages of India&lt;/a&gt; incorporated in 8th annex of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Constitution\"&gt;Indian Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. It has official language status in the formerly independent state of &lt;a href=\"Sikkim\"&gt;Sikkim&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Darjeeling%20district\"&gt;Darjeeling district&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, it is spoken by the Nepalese living in the state of &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20India\"&gt;Northeast India&lt;/a&gt;n states. While Nepali is closely related to the &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt; complex and is mutually intelligible to a degree, it has more &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt;ic derivations and fewer Persian or English loan words. Nepali is commonly written in the &lt;a href=\"Devanagari\"&gt;Devanagari&lt;/a&gt; script, as are Hindi, Sanskrit and Marathi.\nPersian.\n&lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; became the second lingua franca of the Islamic world, in particular of the eastern regions. Besides serving as the state and administrative language in many Islamic dynasties, some of which included &lt;a href=\"Samanids\"&gt;Samanids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghurids\"&gt;Ghurids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghaznavids\"&gt;Ghaznavids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ilkhanid\"&gt;Ilkhanid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Seljuqids\"&gt;Seljuqids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20Empire\"&gt;Mughals&lt;/a&gt; and early &lt;a href=\"Ottomans\"&gt;Ottomans&lt;/a&gt;, Persian cultural and political forms, and often the Persian language, were used by the cultural elites from the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;. For example, Persian was the only oriental language known and used by &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Polo\"&gt;Marco Polo&lt;/a&gt; at the Court of &lt;a href=\"Kublai%20Khan\"&gt;Kublai Khan&lt;/a&gt; and in his journeys through China. &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Joseph%20Toynbee\"&gt;Arnold Joseph Toynbee&lt;/a&gt;'s assessment of the role of the Persian language is worth quoting in more detail:\nIn the Iranic world, before it began to succumb to the process of Westernization, the New Persian language, which had been fashioned into literary form in mighty works of art ... gained a currency as a lingua franca; and at its widest, about the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries of the Christian Era, its range in this role extended, without a break, across the face of South-Eastern Europe and South-Western Asia.\nPersian remains the lingua franca in &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tajikistan\"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSadri.\n&lt;a href=\"Sadri%20language\"&gt;Sadri&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Nagpuri, is a &lt;a href=\"Bihari%20languages\"&gt;Bihari-group language&lt;/a&gt; that functions as the lingua franca of the linguistically diverse &lt;a href=\"Chota%20Nagpur%20plateau\"&gt;Chota Nagpur plateau&lt;/a&gt; in India, mainly in the state of &lt;a href=\"Jharkhand\"&gt;Jharkhand&lt;/a&gt;. It is frequently used between tribes who have different mother tongues.\nSanskrit.\n&lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; historically served as a lingua franca throughout the majority of India.\nTagalog.\nTagalog was declared the official language by the first &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; in the Philippines, the in 1897. Native Tagalog speakers continue to make up one of the country's largest linguistic and cultural groups, numbering an estimated 14 million. The &lt;a href=\"Filipino%20language\"&gt;Filipino language&lt;/a&gt;, which is standardised register of Tagalog, is taught in schools throughout the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; and is an official language of education and business along with &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20English\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the large number of &lt;a href=\"languages%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;languages of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, the designation of Tagalog as 'Filipino' and 'national' in character is often disputed, as the &lt;a href=\"Visayan%20languages\"&gt;Visayan languages&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"Cebuano%20language\"&gt;Cebuano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hiligaynon%20language\"&gt;Hiligaynon&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Ilocano%20language\"&gt;Ilocano&lt;/a&gt; are among several languages that have comparatively large numbers of speakers, and are themselves used as lingua francas in their respective regions. See also &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Manila\"&gt;Imperial Manila&lt;/a&gt;.\nTamil.\n&lt;a href=\"John%20Guy%20%28historian%29\"&gt;John Guy&lt;/a&gt; states that Tamil was the &lt;a href=\"lingua%20franca\"&gt;lingua franca&lt;/a&gt; for early maritime traders from India. The language and its dialects were used widely in the state of Kerala as the major language of administration, literature and common usage until the 12th century AD. Tamil was also used widely in inscriptions found in southern &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Pradesh\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; districts of &lt;a href=\"Chittoor%20district\"&gt;Chittoor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nellore%20district\"&gt;Nellore&lt;/a&gt; until the 12th century AD. Tamil was used for inscriptions from the 10th through 14th centuries in southern Karnataka districts such as &lt;a href=\"Kolar%20District\"&gt;Kolar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mysore\"&gt;Mysore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mandya\"&gt;Mandya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bangalore\"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;. \nThai.\nMuch of &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; does not speak &lt;a href=\"Thai%20language\"&gt;Thai proper&lt;/a&gt; as their first language and instead speaks a closely related language, such as &lt;a href=\"Isan%20language\"&gt;Isan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lanna%20language\"&gt;Lanna&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Thai%20language\"&gt;Southern Thai&lt;/a&gt;; nevertheless, citizens use the Thai of &lt;a href=\"Central%20Thailand\"&gt;Central Thailand&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with one another.\nSylheti.\nSylhet region is multilingual, historically the languages of the region consists of &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20language\"&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylheti%20language\"&gt;Sylheti Nagari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Meitei%20language\"&gt;Meitei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khasi%20language\"&gt;Khasi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barman%20language\"&gt;Barman Thar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sadri%20language\"&gt;Sadri language&lt;/a&gt; speakers are bilingual and some use &lt;a href=\"Sylheti%20language\"&gt;Sylheti language&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sylhet%20Division\"&gt;Sylhet Region&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sylheti%20language\"&gt;Sylheti&lt;/a&gt; is the second language of 2 million speakers. \nIn the Assam region of India, different ethnic groups speaks &lt;a href=\"Sylheti%20language\"&gt;Sylheti&lt;/a&gt; due to the historical connection of &lt;a href=\"Kamarupa\"&gt;Kamarupa&lt;/a&gt; - Pragjyotisha and relative split between borders after the &lt;a href=\"Partition%20of%20India\"&gt;Partition of India&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersian and Arabic settlers in the middle age adopted the local language of &lt;a href=\"Srihatta\"&gt;Srihatta&lt;/a&gt;. Since then it is considered as lingua franca. \nIn &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, the Sylheti &lt;a href=\"British%20Bangladeshis\"&gt;British Bangladeshis&lt;/a&gt; can speak Sylheti. The analysis indicates unequivocally that Sylheti is dominant among immediate and extended family and friends. It is the lingua franca of the majority in that no other language is necessary for this encapsulated community.\nEurope.\nBulgarian.\nBetween 9th and 11th century &lt;a href=\"Old%20Bulgarian\"&gt;Old Bulgarian&lt;/a&gt; was the lingua franca of a great part of the predominantly &lt;a href=\"Slavs\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt; states and populations in &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Europe\"&gt;Southeast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"liturgy\"&gt;liturgy&lt;/a&gt; and church organization, culture, literature, education and diplomacy. It was the first national and also international &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20languages\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"literary%20language\"&gt;literary language&lt;/a&gt; (autonym , ).\nBulgarian students of the &lt;a href=\"equal-to-apostles\"&gt;apostles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saints%20Cyril%20and%20Methodius\"&gt;Saints Cyril and Methodius&lt;/a&gt;, who were expelled from Great Moravia in 886, including &lt;a href=\"Clement%20of%20Ohrid\"&gt;Clement of Ohrid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Naum\"&gt;Saint Naum&lt;/a&gt;, brought the Glagolitic alphabet to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;First Bulgarian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and were received and accepted officially by &lt;a href=\"Boris%20I%20of%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Boris I of Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;. He established two literary schools: the &lt;a href=\"Preslav%20Literary%20School\"&gt;Preslav Literary School&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ohrid%20Literary%20School\"&gt;Ohrid Literary School&lt;/a&gt;. The Glagolitic alphabet was originally used at both schools, though the &lt;a href=\"Cyrillic%20script\"&gt;Cyrillic script&lt;/a&gt; was developed early on at the &lt;a href=\"Preslav%20Literary%20School\"&gt;Preslav Literary School&lt;/a&gt;, where it superseded Glagolitic as official in &lt;a href=\"First%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; in 893.\nThe texts written during this era exhibit linguistic features of the vernaculars of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Bulgarian%20Empire\"&gt;First Bulgarian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Old Church Slavonic spread to other South-Eastern, Central, and Eastern European Slavic territories, most notably &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Poland\"&gt;Lesser Poland&lt;/a&gt;, and principalities of the &lt;a href=\"Kievan%20Rus%27\"&gt;Kievan Rus'&lt;/a&gt; while retaining characteristically &lt;a href=\"South%20Slavic%20languages\"&gt;South Slavic&lt;/a&gt; linguistic features. It spread also to not completely Slavic territories, like those between the &lt;a href=\"Carpathian%20Mountains\"&gt;Carpathian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20sea\"&gt;Black sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater texts written in each of those territories then began to take on characteristics of the local Slavic vernaculars and, by the mid-11th century, Old Church Slavonic had diversified into a number of regional varieties (known as \"recensions\"). The &lt;a href=\"Church%20Slavonic%20language\"&gt;Church Slavonic language&lt;/a&gt; is the later form which is still used in liturgies to this day.\nThe name Old Bulgarian was extensively used in the late 19th and the first half of the 20th century synonymously with Old Church Slavonic to describe the literary language of a number of Slavic peoples from the 9th until the 12th century. Although Old Bulgarian is still used in a number of sources with the meaning \"Old Church Slavonic\", there is a growing tendency for the name to be applied only to the language of manuscripts from the First Bulgarian Empire (Bulgarian editions of Old Church Slavonic), excluding manuscripts from other editions.\nEnglish.\nEnglish is the current lingua franca of international business, education, science, technology, diplomacy, entertainment, radio, seafaring, and aviation. Since the end of World War I, it has gradually replaced French as the lingua franca of international diplomacy. The rise of English in diplomacy began in 1919, when the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt; was written in English as well as in French, the dominant language used in diplomacy until that time. The widespread use of English was further advanced by the prominent international role played by English-speaking nations (the United States and the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth of Nations&lt;/a&gt;) in the aftermath of World War II, particularly in the establishment and organization of the United Nations. English is one of the six &lt;a href=\"official%20languages%20of%20the%20United%20Nations\"&gt;official languages of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt; (the other five being French, Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Spanish). The seating and roll-call order in sessions of the United Nations and its subsidiary and affiliated organizations is determined by alphabetical order of the English names of the countries.\nWhen the United Kingdom became a colonial power, English served as the lingua franca of the colonies of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations which had multiple &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20language\"&gt;indigenous language&lt;/a&gt;s opted to continue using English as an official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. The British Empire established the use of English in regions around the world such as North America, India, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, so that by the late 19th century its reach was truly global, and in the latter half of the 20th century, widespread international use of English was much reinforced by the global economic, financial, scientific, military, and cultural pre-eminence of the English-speaking countries, especially the United States. Today, more than half of all &lt;a href=\"scientific%20journals\"&gt;scientific journals&lt;/a&gt; are published in English, even in France almost one-third of all &lt;a href=\"natural%20science\"&gt;natural science&lt;/a&gt; research appears in English, so that English can be seen as the lingua franca of science and technology. English is also the lingua franca of international &lt;a href=\"air%20traffic%20control\"&gt;air traffic control&lt;/a&gt; and seafaring communications.\nFrench.\nFrench was the language of diplomacy from the 17th century until the mid-20th century, and is still a working language of some &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20international%20organisations%20which%20have%20French%20as%20an%20official%20language\"&gt;international institutions&lt;/a&gt;. In the international sporting world French is still the lingua franca of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile\"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt;. French is still seen on documents ranging from passports to airmail letters.\nFrench is spoken by educated people in cosmopolitan cities of the Middle East and North Africa and remains so in the former French colonies of the &lt;a href=\"Maghreb\"&gt;Maghreb&lt;/a&gt;, where French is particularly important in economic capitals such as &lt;a href=\"Algiers\"&gt;Algiers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Casablanca\"&gt;Casablanca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tunis\"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;. Until the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; in Lebanon, French was spoken by the upper-class Christian population. French is still a lingua franca in most &lt;a href=\"West%20Africa\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; and Central African countries and an official language of many, a remnant of French and Belgian colonialism. These African countries and others are members of the &lt;a href=\"Francophonie\"&gt;Francophonie&lt;/a&gt;. French is the official language of the &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Postal%20Union\"&gt;Universal Postal Union&lt;/a&gt;, with English added as a working language in 1994.\nGerman.\nGerman served as a lingua franca in portions of Europe for centuries, mainly the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; outside of the sphere of influence of the &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20League\"&gt;Hanseatic League&lt;/a&gt;, which used \"&lt;a href=\"%23Low%20German\"&gt;Low German&lt;/a&gt;\", and to a lesser extent in Eastern Europe where the Polish Empire and the Russian Empire dominated, and South-Eastern Europe where the Ottoman Empire was the dominant cultural influence over the centuries. In fact, the Romantic movement with Goethe and Schiller at its top, at the end of the 18th century, served as a rediscovery of the German language for the German people that used, at this point, largely French as a lingua franca like almost all European regions, but German can be indeed still considered as a lingua franca though with far less importance than French until the 20th century or English today.\nGerman remained an important second language in much of &lt;a href=\"Central%20and%20Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Central and Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; after the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Empire\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 1918 for a few years. Today, although to a much diminished degree after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, it is still a common second language in a few countries which were formerly part of the empire, such as &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; (50 % of the population, next to English with 57 %), &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; (34%), the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; (28%) and &lt;a href=\"Slovakia\"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; (28%). In others, it survived so far as a minor language (in Poland by 18%, in Hungary by 16%), usually after English and Russian, in this order, without being considered a lingua franca anymore.\n&lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Expulsion%20of%20Germans\"&gt;the expulsion of Germans from many European countries between 1945 and 1950&lt;/a&gt; had a disastrous effect on the use of the German language in Central and Eastern Europe, where it was often suppressed and eventually dropped as a lingua franca by the mid-to-late 20th century being replaced by Russian during the Cold War and nowadays by English.\nGreek and Latin.\nDuring the time of the &lt;a href=\"Hellenistic%20civilization\"&gt;Hellenistic civilization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the lingua francas were &lt;a href=\"Koine%20Greek\"&gt;Koine Greek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the lingua franca was Greek in the parts of Europe, Middle East and Northern Africa where the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt; held hegemony, and Latin was primarily used in the rest of Europe. Latin, for a significant portion of the expansion of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, was the universal language of prayer and worship. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Vatican%20Council\"&gt;Second Vatican Council&lt;/a&gt;, Catholic liturgy changed to local languages, although Latin remains the official language of the &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20City\"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt;. Latin was used as the language of scholars in Europe until the early 19th century in most subjects. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Simpson\"&gt;Christopher Simpson&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Chelys\"&gt;Chelys&lt;/a&gt; or The &lt;a href=\"Division%20viol\"&gt;Division viol&lt;/a&gt;\" on how to improvise on the &lt;a href=\"viol\"&gt;viol&lt;/a&gt; (viola da gamba) was published in 1665 in a multilingual edition in Latin and English, to make the material accessible for the wider European music community. Another example is the Danish-Norwegian writer &lt;a href=\"Ludvig%20Holberg\"&gt;Ludvig Holberg&lt;/a&gt;, who published his book \"&lt;a href=\"Niels%20Klim%27s%20Underground%20Travels\"&gt;Nicolai Klimii iter subterraneum&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1741 about an ideal society \"Potu\" (\"&lt;a href=\"utopia\"&gt;Utop&lt;/a&gt;\" backwards) with equality between the genders and an egalitarian structure, in Latin in Germany to avoid Danish censorship and to reach a greater audience. &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton\"&gt;Newton&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Philosophi%C3%A6%20Naturalis%20Principia%20Mathematica\"&gt;Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica&lt;/a&gt;\" was published in Latin in 1687: the first English translation did not appear until 1729. In subjects like medicine and theology Latin has been a subject of study until the present day in most European universities, despite declining use in recent years. An example of the continuing influence of Latin would be the phrase \"lingua franca\" itself, being a Latinate one.\nItalian.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Lingua%20Franca\"&gt;Mediterranean Lingua Franca&lt;/a&gt; was largely based on Italian and &lt;a href=\"Proven%C3%A7al%20dialect\"&gt;Proven\u00e7al&lt;/a&gt;. This language was spoken from the 11th to 19th centuries around the Mediterranean basin, particularly in the European commercial empires of Italian cities (&lt;a href=\"Genoa\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt;, Venice, &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, Milan, &lt;a href=\"Pisa\"&gt;Pisa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siena\"&gt;Siena&lt;/a&gt;) and in trading ports located throughout the eastern Mediterranean rim.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, standard Italian was spoken as a language of culture in the main royal courts of Europe, and among intellectuals. This lasted from the 14th century to the end of the 16th, when French replaced Italian as the usual lingua franca in northern Europe. On the other hand, Italian &lt;a href=\"musical%20terms\"&gt;musical terms&lt;/a&gt;, in particular dynamic and tempo notations, have continued in use to the present day, especially for classical music, in music revues and program notes as well as in printed scores. Italian is considered the language of Opera.\nIn the Catholic ecclesiastic hierarchy, Italian is known by a large part of members and is used in substitution of Latin in most official documents as well. The presence of Italian as the official language in &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20City\"&gt;Vatican City&lt;/a&gt; indicates its use not only in the seat in Rome, but also anywhere in the world where an episcopal seat is present.\nItalian served as the official lingua franca in &lt;a href=\"Italian%20North%20Africa\"&gt;Italian North Africa&lt;/a&gt; (present-day &lt;a href=\"Libya\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of the colonies of &lt;a href=\"Cyrenaica\"&gt;Cyrenaica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tripolitania\"&gt;Tripolitania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fazzan\"&gt;Fazzan&lt;/a&gt;) and in &lt;a href=\"Italian%20East%20Africa\"&gt;Italian East Africa&lt;/a&gt; (consisting of the present-day countries of the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Africa\"&gt;Horn of Africa&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Eritrea\"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Somalia\"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;).\nLow German.\nFrom about 1200 to 1600, &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Low%20German\"&gt;Middle Low German&lt;/a&gt; was the language of the &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20League\"&gt;Hanseatic League&lt;/a&gt; which was present in most Northern European seaports, even London. It resulted in numerous Low German words being borrowed into Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. After the Middle Ages, modern High German and Dutch began to displace Low German, and it has now been reduced to many regional dialects, although they are still largely mutually intelligible. In recent years, the language has seen a resurgence in public interest, and it is increasingly being used as a mode of communication between speakers of (northern) German and (eastern) Dutch nationality.\nPolish.\nPolish was a lingua franca in areas of &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt; and Eastern Europe, especially regions that belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;. Polish was for several centuries the main language spoken by the ruling classes in &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, and the modern state of &lt;a href=\"Belarus\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Partitions%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Partitions of Poland&lt;/a&gt; and the incorporation of most of the Polish areas into the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Congress%20Poland\"&gt;Congress Poland&lt;/a&gt;, the Russian language almost completely supplanted Polish.\nPortuguese.\nPortuguese served as lingua franca in the Portuguese Empire, Africa, South America and Asia in the 15th and 16th centuries. When the Portuguese started exploring the seas of Africa, America, Asia and Oceania, they tried to communicate with the natives by mixing a Portuguese-influenced version of lingua franca with the local languages. When Dutch, English or French ships came to compete with the Portuguese, the crews tried to learn this \"broken Portuguese\". Through a process of change the lingua franca and Portuguese lexicon was replaced with the languages of the people in contact.\nPortuguese remains an important lingua franca in the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese-speaking%20African%20countries\"&gt;Portuguese-speaking African countries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Timor\"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;, and to a certain extent in &lt;a href=\"Macau\"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt; where it is recognized as an official language alongside Chinese though in practice not commonly spoken.\nRussian.\nRussian is in use and widely understood in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Caucasus\"&gt;Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Baltics\"&gt;Baltics&lt;/a&gt;, areas formerly part of the Soviet Union or &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20bloc\"&gt;bloc&lt;/a&gt;, and in much of &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt; and Eastern Europe, formerly part of the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt;. It remains the official language of the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States\"&gt;Commonwealth of Independent States&lt;/a&gt;. Russian is also one of the &lt;a href=\"Official%20languages%20of%20the%20United%20Nations\"&gt;six official languages of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;.\nSerbo-Croatian.\n&lt;a href=\"Serbo-Croatian%20language\"&gt;Serbo-Croatian&lt;/a&gt; is a lingua franca in several of the territories of the &lt;a href=\"former%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;former Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosnia\"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Montenegro\"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;. In those four countries, it is the main native language and is also spoken by ethnic minorities. For example, a &lt;a href=\"Hungarians%20in%20Serbia\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Vojvodina\"&gt;Vojvodina&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Istrian%20Italians\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Istria\"&gt;Istria&lt;/a&gt; might use it as a shared second language. Most people in &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Macedonia%20%28country%29\"&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; can understand or speak Serbo-Croatian as well. It is a pluricentric language and is commonly referred to as Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, or Montenegrin depending on the background of the speaker.\nSpanish.\nWith the growth of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Empire\"&gt;Spanish Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Spanish became established in the Americas, as well as in parts of Africa, Asia and Oceania. It became the language of global trade until &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt; and the breakup of the Spanish Empire at the beginning of the 19th century. Spanish was used as a lingua franca throughout the former Spanish Colonial Empire, including territory in present-day U.S., but particularly in present-day &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Caribbean\"&gt;Spanish Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Central%20America\"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt;, South America and &lt;a href=\"Captaincy%20General%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, and still remains the lingua franca within &lt;a href=\"Hispanic%20America\"&gt;Hispanic America&lt;/a&gt;. It is also widely understood, and spoken to different degrees, by many people in Brazil, especially in the South and Southeast.\nAt present it is the second most used language in international trade, and the third most used in politics, diplomacy and culture after English and French.\nTurkish.\n&lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; is still in use and widely spoken in several areas formerly part of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and may be understood by older people in other parts of the Balkans. It is still used among the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20people\"&gt;Turks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurds\"&gt;Kurds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zazas\"&gt;Zazas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armenians\"&gt;Armenians&lt;/a&gt;, and more &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20groups%20in%20Turkey\"&gt;ethnicities in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. \nYiddish.\n&lt;a href=\"Yiddish\"&gt;Yiddish&lt;/a&gt; originated in the &lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi\"&gt;Ashkenazi&lt;/a&gt; culture that developed from about the 10th century in the &lt;a href=\"Rhineland\"&gt;Rhineland&lt;/a&gt; and then spread to &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;central&lt;/a&gt; and eastern Europe and eventually to other continents. For a significant portion of its history, Yiddish was the primary spoken language of the &lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi%20Jews\"&gt;Ashkenazi Jews&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Yiddish%20dialects\"&gt;Eastern Yiddish&lt;/a&gt;, three dialects of which are still spoken today, includes a significant but varying percentage of words from &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20languages\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; and other local languages.\nOn the eve of World War II, there were 11 to 13 million Yiddish speakers, for many of whom Yiddish was not the primary language. &lt;a href=\"The%20Holocaust\"&gt;The Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;, however, led to a dramatic, sudden decline in the use of Yiddish, as the extensive Jewish communities, both secular and religious, that used Yiddish in their day-to-day life were largely destroyed. Although millions of Yiddish speakers survived the war, further assimilation in countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union, along with the strictly &lt;a href=\"Hebrew\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; monolingual stance of the &lt;a href=\"Zionist\"&gt;Zionist&lt;/a&gt; movement, led to a decline in the use of Yiddish. However, the number of speakers within the widely dispersed &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20Judaism\"&gt;Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; (mainly &lt;a href=\"Hasidic%20Judaism\"&gt;Hasidic&lt;/a&gt;) communities is now increasing. It is a home language in most &lt;a href=\"Hasidic%20Judaism\"&gt;Hasidic&lt;/a&gt; communities, where it is the first language learned in childhood, used in schools, and in many social settings.\nIn the United States, as well as South America, the Yiddish language bonded Jews from many countries. Most of the Jewish immigrants to the New York metropolitan area during the years of &lt;a href=\"Ellis%20Island\"&gt;Ellis Island&lt;/a&gt; considered Yiddish their native language. Later, Yiddish was no longer the primary language for the majority of the remaining speakers and often served as lingua franca for the Jewish immigrants who did not know each other's primary language, particularly following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yiddish was also the language in which second generation immigrants often continued to communicate with their relatives who remained in Europe or moved to Israel, with English, Spanish or Portuguese being primary language of the first and Russian, Romanian, or Hebrew that of the second.\nPre-Columbian North America.\nClassic Maya.\n&lt;a href=\"Classic%20Maya%20language\"&gt;Classic Maya&lt;/a&gt; was commonly used as a written language in the &lt;a href=\"Maya%20civilization\"&gt;Maya civilization&lt;/a&gt;, and may have also been a spoken lingua franca among Maya elites.\nChinook Jargon.\n&lt;a href=\"Chinook%20Jargon\"&gt;Chinook Jargon&lt;/a&gt; was originally constructed from a great variety of Amerind words of the Pacific Northwest, arising as an intra-indigenous contact language in a region marked by divisive geography and intense linguistic diversity. The participating peoples came from a number of very distinct language families, speaking dozens of individual languages.\nAfter European contact, the Jargon also acquired English and French loans, as well as words brought by other European, Asian, and Polynesian groups. Some individuals from all these groups soon adopted the Jargon as a highly efficient and accessible form of communication. This use continued in some business sectors well into the 20th century and some of its words continue to feature in company and organization names as well as in the regional &lt;a href=\"toponymy\"&gt;toponymy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Kamloops\"&gt;Diocese of Kamloops&lt;/a&gt;, British Columbia, hundreds of speakers also learned to read and write the Jargon using the &lt;a href=\"Duployan%20shorthand\"&gt;Duployan shorthand&lt;/a&gt; via the publication \"&lt;a href=\"Kamloops%20Wawa\"&gt;Kamloops Wawa&lt;/a&gt;\". As a result, the Jargon also had the beginnings of its own literature, mostly translated scripture and classical works, and some local and episcopal news, community gossip and events, and diaries. Novelist and early Native American activist, Marah Ellis Ryan (1860?\u20131934) used Chinook words and phrases in her writing.\nAccording to Nard Jones, Chinook Jargon was still in use in Seattle until roughly the eve of World War II, especially among the members of the Arctic Club, making Seattle the last city where the language was widely used. Writing in 1972, he remarked that at that later date \"Only a few can speak it fully, men of ninety or a hundred years old, like &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Broderick%20%28Seattle%29\"&gt;Henry Broderick&lt;/a&gt;, the realtor, and &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Green%20%28seaman%20and%20banker%29\"&gt;Joshua Green&lt;/a&gt;, the banker.\"\nJones estimates that in pioneer times there were about 100,000 speakers of Chinook Jargon.\nHand Talk.\n&lt;a href=\"Plains%20Indian%20Sign%20Language\"&gt;Plains Sign Language&lt;/a&gt;, more directly translated as Hand Talk, but also as Prairie Sign Language, Plains Indian Sign Language, and First Nations Sign Language, was the primary lingua franca of the North American continent from the Sierra Nevadas to &lt;a href=\"Denendeh\"&gt;Denendeh&lt;/a&gt;, well past the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, and down across the northern &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20states\"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. In the West, Hand Talk would give way to Chinook Jargon and perhaps formerly &lt;a href=\"Plateau%20Sign%20Language\"&gt;Plateau Sign Language&lt;/a&gt;. There remains very little documentation or research being doing on this language and its many dialects. However, it is still spoken significantly across &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Country\"&gt;Indian Country&lt;/a&gt;, especially by the &lt;a href=\"Cree\"&gt;Cree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Navajo\"&gt;Navajo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anishinaabeg\"&gt;Anishinaabeg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shoshone\"&gt;Shoshone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackfeet\"&gt;Blackfeet&lt;/a&gt;, and plenty of others.\nNahuatl.\n&lt;a href=\"Classical%20Nahuatl%20language\"&gt;Classical Nahuatl&lt;/a&gt; was the lingua franca of the &lt;a href=\"Aztec%20Empire\"&gt;Aztec Empire&lt;/a&gt; in Mesoamerica prior to the Spanish invasion in the 16th century. An extensive corpus of the language as spoken exists. Like Latin and Hebrew (prior to the founding of modern Israel), Classical Nahuatl was more of a &lt;a href=\"sociolect\"&gt;sociolect&lt;/a&gt; spoken among the elites (poets, priests, traders, teachers, bureaucrats) than a language spoken in any common family household.\nAfter the Spanish conquest, Nahuatl remained the lingua franca of &lt;a href=\"New%20Spain\"&gt;New Spain&lt;/a&gt;. Spanish friars matched the language to a &lt;a href=\"Latin%20alphabet\"&gt;Latin alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, and schools were established to teach Nahuatl to Spanish priests, diplomats, judges, and political leaders. In 1570, Nahuatl was made the official language of New Spain, and it became the lingua franca throughout Spanish North America, used in trade and the courts. During the prolonged &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20conquest%20of%20Guatemala\"&gt;Spanish conquest of Guatemala&lt;/a&gt; Spain's native allies, mostly from &lt;a href=\"Tlaxcala%20%28Nahua%20state%29\"&gt;Tlaxcala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cholula%20%28Mesoamerican%20site%29\"&gt;Cholula&lt;/a&gt;, spread Nahuatl to &lt;a href=\"Maya%20civilization\"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt; areas where it was not spoken prior to the arrival of the Spanish, resulting in Nahuatl placenames across Guatemala which persist up to the present. In 1696, the official use of any language other than Spanish was banned throughout the empire. Especially since Mexican independence, the use of Nahuatl has dwindled.\nOccaneechi.\nPrior to European colonization, the Occaneechi dialect of the &lt;a href=\"Tutelo%20language\"&gt;Tutelo&lt;/a&gt; language served as a lingua franca in the land that would become the state of Virginia. Tutelo was a Siouan language. But Robert Beverley Jr., in the 18th century, observed that the Tuscarora, who spoke an Iroquoian language, and the Powhatan, who spoke an Algonquian language, both used Occaneechi in religious ceremonies, much like modern Christian communities use Latin. Beverley also noted that the Occaneechi language was used by all native nations of Virginia as a trade language.\nAfter European colonists introduced devastating infectious diseases, all native languages of Virginia began to decline. All dialects of Tutelo, including Occaneechi, became extinct by the end of the 20th century. However, there is considerable documentation of the language by numerous linguists, and interest among modern Tutelo people in reviving the language.\nPre-Columbian South America.\nPortuguese and Spanish started to grow as lingua francas in the region in since the conquests of the 16th century. In the Case of Spanish this process was not even and as the Spanish used the structure of Inca Empire to consolidate their rule Quechua remained the lingua franca of large parts of what is now Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. Quechua importance as a language for trade and dealing with Spanish-approved indigenous authorities (&lt;a href=\"curaca\"&gt;curaca&lt;/a&gt;) made the language expand even after the Spanish conquest. It was not until the &lt;a href=\"rebellion%20of%20T%C3%BApac%20Amaru%20II\"&gt;rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II&lt;/a&gt; that the Spanish authorities changed to a policy of Hispanization that was continued by the republican states of Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Quechua also lost influence to Spanish as the commerce circuits grew to integrate other parts of the Spanish Empire where Quechua was unknown, for example in the &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20la%20Plata\"&gt;Rio de la Plata&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuechua.\nAlso known as &lt;a href=\"Runa%20Simi\"&gt;Runa Simi&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Inca%20empire\"&gt;Inca empire&lt;/a&gt; rose to prominence in South America, this imperial language became the most widely spoken language in the western regions of the continent. Even among tribes that were not absorbed by the empire Quechua still became an important language for trade because of the empire's influence. Even after the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20conquest%20of%20the%20Inca%20Empire\"&gt;Spanish conquest&lt;/a&gt; of the Andes, Quechua for a long time was the most common language, and was promoted by the Spanish colonial authorities in the first centuries of colonization. Today it is still widely spoken although it has given way to Spanish as the more common lingua franca. It is spoken by some 10 million people through much of South America (mostly in Peru, south-western and central Bolivia, southern Colombia and Ecuador, north-western Argentina and northern Chile).\nMapudungun.\n&lt;a href=\"Mapudungun\"&gt;Mapudungun&lt;/a&gt; was for a long time used as a lingua franca in large portions of Chile and Argentine &lt;a href=\"Patagonia\"&gt;Patagonia&lt;/a&gt;. Adoption of Spanish was in Chile a slow process and by the 19th century the unconquered Indians of &lt;a href=\"Araucan%C3%ADa%20%28historic%20region%29\"&gt;Araucan\u00eda&lt;/a&gt; had spread their language across the Andes during a process called &lt;a href=\"Araucanization\"&gt;Araucanization&lt;/a&gt;. Pehuenches were among the first non-Mapuche tribes to adopt the language. The increasing commerce over the Andes and the migration of Mapuches into the Patagonian plains contributed to the adoption of Mapudungun by other tribes of a more simple material culture. Even in &lt;a href=\"Chilo%C3%A9%20Archipelago\"&gt;Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago&lt;/a&gt; Spaniards and mestizos adopted a dialect of Mapudungun as their main language.\nTupi.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tupi%20language\"&gt;Old Tupi language&lt;/a&gt; served as the lingua franca of Brazil among speakers of the various indigenous languages, mainly in the coastal regions. Tupi as a lingua franca, and as recorded in colonial books, was in fact a creation of the Portuguese, who assembled it from the similarities between the coastal indigenous &lt;a href=\"Tupi%E2%80%93Guarani%20languages\"&gt;Tupi\u2013Guarani languages&lt;/a&gt;. The language served the Jesuit priests as a way to teach natives, and it was widely spoken by Europeans. It was the predominant language spoken in Brazil until 1758, when the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil by the Portuguese government and the use and teaching of Tupi was banned. Since then, Tupi as lingua franca was quickly replaced by Portuguese, although various Tupi\u2013Guarani languages are still spoken by small native groups in Brazil.\nPidgins and creoles.\nVarious &lt;a href=\"pidgin\"&gt;pidgin&lt;/a&gt; languages have been used in many locations and times as a common trade speech. They can be based on English, French, Chinese, or indeed any other language. A pidgin is defined by its use as a lingua franca, between populations speaking other mother tongues. When a pidgin becomes a population's first language, then it is called a &lt;a href=\"creole%20language\"&gt;creole language&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuinea-Bissau Creole.\n&lt;a href=\"Guinea-Bissau%20Creole\"&gt;Guinea-Bissau Creole&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20creole\"&gt;Portuguese creole&lt;/a&gt; used as a lingua franca of &lt;a href=\"Guinea-Bissau\"&gt;Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Casamance\"&gt;Casamance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Senegal\"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;, among people of different ethnic groups. It is also the mother tongue of many people in Guinea-Bissau.\nTok Pisin.\n&lt;a href=\"Tok%20Pisin\"&gt;Tok Pisin&lt;/a&gt; is widely spoken in &lt;a href=\"Papua%20New%20Guinea\"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; as a lingua franca. It developed as an &lt;a href=\"Australian%20English\"&gt;Australian English&lt;/a&gt;-based creole with influences from local languages and to a smaller extent German or &lt;a href=\"Unserdeutsch%20language\"&gt;Unserdeutsch&lt;/a&gt; and Portuguese."
