    "text": "The Nacionalista Party (&lt;a href=\"Filipino%20language\"&gt;Filipino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language%20in%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;: \"Partido Nacionalista\"; ) is the oldest &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;political party&lt;/a&gt; in both the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt; in general. It is responsible for leading the country throughout the majority of the 20th century since its founding in 1907; it was the ruling party from 1935 to 1946 (under Presidents &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Quezon\"&gt;Manuel Quezon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Osme%C3%B1a\"&gt;Sergio Osme\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;), 1953\u20131961 (under Presidents &lt;a href=\"Ramon%20Magsaysay\"&gt;Ramon Magsaysay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20P.%20Garcia\"&gt;Carlos P. Garcia&lt;/a&gt;) and 1965\u20131972 (under President &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Marcos\"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt;).\nIdeology.\nThe Nacionalista Party was initially created as a &lt;a href=\"Filipino%20nationalist\"&gt;Filipino nationalist&lt;/a&gt; party that supported &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20independence\"&gt;Philippine independence&lt;/a&gt; until 1946 when the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Manila%20%281946%29\"&gt;granted independence to the country&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, many scholarly articles that dealt with the history of political parties during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Republic%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Third Republic&lt;/a&gt; agreed that the party has been increasingly &lt;a href=\"populist\"&gt;populist&lt;/a&gt;, although some argued they had &lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; tendencies because of their opposition to the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Party%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;. The populist ideology of the party remained to present day as described on their website.\nHistory.\nThe party was organized as a vehicle for Philippine independence, advocating self-rule; and espousing this advocacy through representation in the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Assembly\"&gt;Philippine Assembly&lt;/a&gt; of 1907\u20131916, and in the succeeding &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Legislature\"&gt;Philippine Legislature&lt;/a&gt; of 1916\u20131935. The ranks of Nationalist politicians rose to prominence through the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Commonwealth of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; spanning 1935\u20131941, ending when political parties were replaced by a singular and monolithic &lt;a href=\"KALIBAPI\"&gt;KALIBAPI&lt;/a&gt; Party during the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20occupation%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Japanese Occupation&lt;/a&gt; of the Philippines.\nBy the second half of the century, the Nacionalista Party evolved into being main political contenders for leadership in the Philippines, in competition with its rivals, the \"&lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Progressive%20Party\"&gt;Philippine Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt;. This leadership endured until the turbulent suppression of partisan politics during the &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Marcos\"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt; regime. In 1978, akin to the Japanese occupation, disparate political parties were coerced to merge into a regime-controlled coalition, the &lt;a href=\"Kilusang%20Bagong%20Lipunan\"&gt;Kilusang Bagong Lipunan&lt;/a&gt;. Preferring not to be involved, the \"Nacionalistas\" went to hibernation. Years later, in the late 1980s, the party was revived under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Salvador%20Laurel\"&gt;Salvador Laurel&lt;/a&gt; until the latter's passing.\nThe Nacionalista Party is presently led by former Senator &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Villar\"&gt;Manny Villar&lt;/a&gt;, and had fielded three vice-presidential candidates either running independently or in tandem with other political parties, namely &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Peter%20Cayetano\"&gt;Alan Peter Cayetano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bongbong%20Marcos\"&gt;Bongbong Marcos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Trillanes\"&gt;Antonio Trillanes&lt;/a&gt;, albeit unsuccessfully.\nControversy over dominant-minority status.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Philippine%20general%20election\"&gt;2010 general election&lt;/a&gt;, the Nacionalista and the &lt;a href=\"Nationalist%20People%27s%20Coalition\"&gt;Nationalist People's Coalition&lt;/a&gt; (NPC) formed an alliance after it was approved by the &lt;a href=\"Commission%20on%20Elections%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Commission on Elections&lt;/a&gt; (COMELEC) on April 12, 2010. The Nacionalistas fielded Senator &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Villar\"&gt;Manuel Villar&lt;/a&gt; and running with fellow Senator &lt;a href=\"Loren%20Legarda\"&gt;Loren Legarda&lt;/a&gt; who is a member of the NPC. It became the dominant minority party after a resolution passed by the COMELEC. On April 21, 2010, it was blocked by the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; after a suit filed by the rival &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;. On May 6, 2010, the Supreme Court nullified the merger and therefore giving the Liberal Party to be the dominant minority party. It was based on a resolution by the COMELEC giving political parties to be accredited by August 17, 2009.\nThe coalition was made to help the Nacionalista Party to help boost the presidential campaign of Senator Villar and have a chance to be the dominant minority party by the COMELEC which give the rights to poll watchers during the canvassing of votes. However, it is being challenged by the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; calls the said alliance a bogus alliance and they are seeking the same party status by the COMELEC. Several local races are also being challenged from both parties, therefore causing confusion in those races.\nNotable Nacionalistas.\nPast.\nThroughout their careers, many of the country's politicians, statesmen and leaders were in whole or in part Nacionalistas. Notable names include the following:\n&lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Presidents&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vice%20President%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Vice Presidents&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;Senators&lt;/a&gt;\nMost of these individuals embody solid political traditions of &lt;a href=\"Economic%20nationalism\"&gt;economic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nationalism\"&gt;political nationalism&lt;/a&gt; are pertinent today, even with the party's subsequent decline.\nCurrent party officials.\nSome members of the House of Representatives and Senate include\u2014but are not limited to\u2014the following:\nCandidates for 2010 Philippine general election.\nSenatorial Slate (11)\nCandidates for 2013 Philippine general election.\nSenatorial Slate (3) (&lt;a href=\"Team%20PNoy\"&gt;Team PNoy&lt;/a&gt;)\nCandidates for 2016 Philippine general election.\n&lt;a href=\"Candidates%20in%20the%20Philippine%20presidential%20election%2C%202016\"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt;: \nSenatorial Slate\nCandidates for 2019 Philippine general election.\nSenatorial Slate (3) (&lt;a href=\"Hugpong%20ng%20Pagbabago\"&gt;Hugpong ng Pagbabago&lt;/a&gt;)"
