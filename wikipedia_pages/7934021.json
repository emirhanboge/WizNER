Bishop Alan had previously been Auxiliary Bishop of Northampton and co-chairman of ARCIC (Anglican/Roman Catholic International Commission). Being the first bishop of the new diocese, Bishop Alan had to set up all the necessary instruments and commissions for the diocese to operate successfully. The establishment of the Diocesan Pastoral Council in 1987 strengthened these.\nThe diocese continued to grow with the development of the Diocesan offices and Diocesan Tribunal attached to Bishop's House in Poringland near Norwich. Bishop Alan led a number of Lourdes Pilgrimages.\nFollowing his 75th birthday in August 1994 Bishop Alan retired as Bishop of East Anglia.\nOn 21 March 1995 Peter Smith, Rector of St John's Seminary, Southwark Archdiocese, was appointed the second Bishop of East Anglia by Pope John-Paul II. He was ordained Bishop in St John's Cathedral in Norwich on Saturday 27 May 1995 by the late Cardinal Basil Hume.\nOn Friday 14 February 2003 Pope John Paul II appointed Canon Michael Evans as the third Bishop of East Anglia. He succeeded the Most Rev Peter Smith, who became the Archbishop of Cardiff (and later the Archbishop of Southwark).\nCanon Michael was ordained as the third bishop of East Anglia at St John's Cathedral on Wednesday 19 March 2003.\nSadly, Bishop Michael Evans died after a very brave fight against cancer on 11 July 2011, whilst still in office.\nFollowing Bishop Michael's death,\u00a0Vicar General Fr David Bagstaff\u00a0acted as Diocesan Administrator during the inter-regnum.\nOn 11 June 2013\u00a0Pope Francis\u00a0appointed Bishop Alan Hopes as the fourth\u00a0Bishop of East Anglia and he was duly installed on 16 July 2013 at\u00a0St John's Cathedral, by Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, in front of a congregation of nearly 2,000 people.\nIn November 2014, Bishop Alan was made a Knight Commander with Star of The Equestrian Order of The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem.\nA Cathedral Chapter was established with the installation of nine Canons at a Solemn Mass at St John the Baptist on 17 March 2016. The Canons also act as a College of Consultors for the bishop.\nOn 3 June 2016 the Diocese of East Anglia celebrated its 40th Anniversary with a Mass at St John's Cathedral. The preacher was Cardinal Nichols.\nThe Apostolic Nuncio to Great Britain, His Excellency Archbishop Edward Adams, conducted a four-day visit to the Diocese of East Anglia in May 2019.\nPilgrimage.\nThe diocese makes up part of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Association%20Pilgrimage\"&gt;Catholic Association Pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt;."
