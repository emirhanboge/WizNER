    "text": "Florida State Hospital (FSH) is a &lt;a href=\"hospital\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"psychiatric%20hospital\"&gt;psychiatric hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chattahoochee%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Chattahoochee, Florida&lt;/a&gt;. Established in 1876, it was Florida's only state mental institution until 1947. It currently has a capacity of 1,042 patients. The hospital's current Administration Building is on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe facility's property previously served as a military &lt;a href=\"arsenal\"&gt;arsenal&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Seminole%20Wars\"&gt;Seminole Wars&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, and later became the site of Florida's first state &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;. It was subsequently refurbished as a mental hospital, originally known as Florida State Hospital for the Insane, which opened in 1876. It gained notoriety over the course of its long history. It was sued in \"&lt;a href=\"O%27Connor%20v.%20Donaldson\"&gt;O'Connor v. Donaldson&lt;/a&gt;\", a case that went to the US Supreme Court, which ruled that the hospital had illegally confined one of its patients. The decision contributed to the &lt;a href=\"deinstitutionalization\"&gt;deinstitutionalization&lt;/a&gt; movement, which resulted in changes to state laws and the closure of many public mental institutions in the country. The hospital today treats patients with severe mental disabilities who have been civilly or forensically committed to the institution.\nEarly history.\nThe hospital campus was originally the site of the Apalachicola Arsenal, built in the 1830s and named after the nearby &lt;a href=\"Apalachicola%20River\"&gt;Apalachicola River&lt;/a&gt;. The hospital's current Administration Building was adapted from the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Arsenal-Officers%20Quarters\"&gt;original Officers' Quarters&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arsenal\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; and is listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;. The Arsenal facility served as a supply depot during the &lt;a href=\"Seminole%20Wars\"&gt;Seminole Wars&lt;/a&gt;. The first engagement of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; took place here on January 6, 1861 when a &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;Confederate&lt;/a&gt; militia unit from &lt;a href=\"Quincy%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Quincy&lt;/a&gt; overcame &lt;a href=\"Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; soldiers at the Arsenal.\nIn 1868, Florida Governor &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Reed%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Harrison Reed&lt;/a&gt; converted the arsenal property at Chattahoochee into Florida's first &lt;a href=\"Prison\"&gt;penitentiary&lt;/a&gt;. Florida's first recorded inmate was Calvin Williams, incarcerated in Chattahoochee in November 1868 for the crime of &lt;a href=\"larceny\"&gt;larceny&lt;/a&gt; and sentenced to one year. By 1869 there were 42 inmates and 14 guards.\nIn 1871, the prison was put under civilian jurisdiction. &lt;a href=\"Malachi%20Martin%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Malachi Martin&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as warden, gaining a reputation for cruelty and &lt;a href=\"Political%20corruption\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;. He used prison labor for his personal benefit to build houses and tend his personal &lt;a href=\"vineyard\"&gt;vineyard&lt;/a&gt;s, amassing a huge fortune. The book \"The American Siberia\", written in 1891, portrayed the Chattahoochee prison as a place of relentless barbarity. After the prisoners were relocated in 1876 to a prison at &lt;a href=\"Raiford%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Raiford, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, the facility was adapted as a state hospital.\nHospital.\nIn 1876, the prison was refurbished and established by the &lt;a href=\"Reconstruction%20era\"&gt;Reconstruction era&lt;/a&gt; legislature as the Florida State Hospital for the Insane, the state's first &lt;a href=\"mental%20institution\"&gt;mental institution&lt;/a&gt;. It was an effort by the legislature to establish some public welfare institutions to assist residents in the state.\nOver time, the hospital was investigated for allegations of &lt;a href=\"mistreatment\"&gt;mistreatment&lt;/a&gt; of patients, especially as treatment standards changed.\nThe hospital was sued in \"&lt;a href=\"O%27Connor%20v.%20Donaldson\"&gt;O'Connor v. Donaldson&lt;/a&gt;\" (1975), a case that reached the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;United States Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Donaldson\"&gt;Kenneth Donaldson&lt;/a&gt;, a patient held there, sued the hospital and staff for confining him for fifteen years against his will. The court ruled that he had been illegally held.\nThe decision, as interpreted by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union\"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU), means that it is unconstitutional to commit for treatment persons who are not imminently a danger to themselves or others and who are capable to a minimal degree of surviving on their own. This interpretation has hampered efforts to implement changes in commitment laws throughout the United States, as most states insist the person meet the \"imminent danger\" standard, accepting the ACLU's interpretation of the O'Connor v. Donaldson case. The ruling contributed to the &lt;a href=\"deinstitutionalization\"&gt;deinstitutionalization&lt;/a&gt; movement in the United States, resulting in the shutting down of many large, public psychiatric hospitals.\nCurrent population.\nThe hospital treats individuals with severe and persistent major mental illnesses. Two categories of patients are treated at the hospital; those civilly committed under Statute 394, who represent a small portion of the hospital's residents; and those forensically committed under Statute 916. The Civil portion of the hospital houses adult and elderly individuals who have been &lt;a href=\"Civil%20procedure\"&gt;civilly committed&lt;/a&gt; to the hospital, and forensic residents who have been \"stepped down\" to the civil unit. The civil units are also known as Forensic Transition units.\nFlorida State Hospital also maintains a forensic wing for the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Department%20of%20Corrections\"&gt;Florida Department of Corrections&lt;/a&gt; to care for &lt;a href=\"Prison\"&gt;inmates&lt;/a&gt; who have been adjudicated through the &lt;a href=\"criminal%20justice%20system\"&gt;criminal justice system&lt;/a&gt; to be incompetent to proceed to trial, or not guilty by reason of insanity. The current maximum housing capacity is 491 residents in civil units and 646 residents in forensic units.\nThe goal of the hospital's efforts is recovery. The hospital works to restore competency to residents adjudicated incompetent to proceed to trial. Residents receive competency training in both forensic and civil units. The amount of time needed to restore competency varies from a month or two, to up to five years. However, by statute, a patient cannot be committed for more than five years as incompetent to proceed. Upon five years of commitment that patient will be returned to court to have his/her charges dropped or commuted in some way. For residents adjudicated not guilty by reason of insanity, the hospital works to assist the resident in transitioning back into community living by learning appropriate activities for daily living, and social cues. Hospital staff ensure the resident is no longer at risk of reoffending before recommending to the judge that the patient is ready for a conditional release to the community. Unlike patients committed as \"Incompetent to Proceed,\" those committed as \"Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity\" have no time limit on their commitment. They can remain committed by their presiding judge until their recovery is complete.\nCompetency to be executed.\nOne of the tasks of the &lt;a href=\"Forensic%20psychology\"&gt;forensic psychologists&lt;/a&gt; in the forensic wing is to evaluate an inmate's &lt;a href=\"Competency%20evaluation%20%28law%29\"&gt;competency&lt;/a&gt; to be executed, as common law holds that the insane cannot be executed.\nThis is a result of \"&lt;a href=\"Ford%20v.%20Wainwright\"&gt;Ford v. Wainwright&lt;/a&gt;\" (1986). A Florida inmate on &lt;a href=\"death%20row\"&gt;death row&lt;/a&gt; appealed his case to the United States Supreme Court, declaring he was not competent to be executed. The court ruled that a forensic professional must make that evaluation and, if the inmate is found incompetent, provide treatment to aid in his gaining competency so the execution can take place. Providing treatment to an individual to enable that person to become competent to be executed puts mental health professionals in an ethical dilemma.\nHistoric place.\nThe former arsenal and current Administration Building of Florida State Hospital is listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;. Built in 1839 as the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Arsenal-Officers%20Quarters\"&gt;U.S. Arsenal-Officers Quarters&lt;/a&gt;, it is a two-story masonry brick main building, with -story wings and front and rear porches framed with carved brackets."
