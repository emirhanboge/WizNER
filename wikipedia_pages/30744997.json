    "text": "The Kildare Street Club was a member's club in Dublin, Ireland, at the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Irish\"&gt;Anglo-Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Ascendancy\"&gt;Protestant Ascendancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Club remained in &lt;a href=\"Kildare%20Street\"&gt;Kildare Street&lt;/a&gt; between 1782 and 1977, when it merged with the &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20University%20Club\"&gt;Dublin University Club&lt;/a&gt; to become the &lt;a href=\"Kildare%20Street%20%26amp%3B%20University%20Club\"&gt;Kildare Street &amp; University Club&lt;/a&gt;, moving to the University Club's 1776 premises at number 17 on the North side of &lt;a href=\"St%20Stephen%27s%20Green\"&gt;St Stephen's Green&lt;/a&gt;. Its second Kildare Street club house, built between 1859 and 1860, has not been disposed of but is now &lt;a href=\"Leasehold%20estate\"&gt;leased&lt;/a&gt; to a Heraldic Museum and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Fran%C3%A7aise\"&gt;Alliance Fran\u00e7aise&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFounded in the year of the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%201782\"&gt;Constitution of 1782&lt;/a&gt;, the Club's first home was a house in Kildare Street built by Sir Henry Cavendish on land bought from &lt;a href=\"James%20FitzGerald%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Leinster\"&gt;James FitzGerald, 20th Earl of Kildare&lt;/a&gt;, later first &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Leinster\"&gt;Duke of Leinster&lt;/a&gt;. In 1786 the club acquired an adjoining house also built by Cavendish, thus completing its original club house.\nThere is a tradition that what prompted the foundation of the Club was the &lt;a href=\"blackballing\"&gt;blackballing&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"William%20Conyngham\"&gt;William Burton Conyngham&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Daly%27s%20Club\"&gt;Daly's Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Street\"&gt;Dame Street&lt;/a&gt;. This led to an exodus of members from Daly's, who formed a new club which soon rivalled their old one as a fashionable haunt and which in the end eclipsed it. Although by the later 19th century the Club was closely associated with the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Ascendancy\"&gt;Protestant Ascendancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unionism%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;Irish Unionism&lt;/a&gt;, nevertheless its earliest members included men strongly opposed to the British connection, such as &lt;a href=\"Jonah%20Barrington%20%28judge%29\"&gt;Sir Jonah Barrington&lt;/a&gt;, who argued against the creation in 1801 of a &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a famous incident at the Kildare Street Club in 1806, &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Mathew%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Landaff\"&gt;Earl Landaff&lt;/a&gt;, a supporter of &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Emancipation\"&gt;Catholic Emancipation&lt;/a&gt;, denounced the \"eighty-five scoundrels\" who had blackballed his brother &lt;a href=\"Montague%20James%20Mathew\"&gt;Montague James Mathew&lt;/a&gt;, and stalked out of the Club, never to return.\nBy 1840, the Club had some six hundred and fifty members, \"a large and elegant card-room, coffee, reading, and billiard-rooms\". There was a committee of fifteen members, elected annually. Admission to membership was by ballot, with an entrance fee of &lt;a href=\"Pound%20sterling\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;26, 10&lt;a href=\"shilling\"&gt;s.&lt;/a&gt;, and an annual subscription of \u00a35.\nIn 1858, it was decided to build a new club house, as the original premises at 6, Kildare Street, were now too small for the club's needs. In 1859, the club was described in \"The Building News\" as \"an institution famous for &lt;a href=\"aristocracy\"&gt;aristocracy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"claret\"&gt;claret&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"whist\"&gt;whist&lt;/a&gt;...\" Between 1859 and 1860, the new club house was built, designed by &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Newenham%20Deane\"&gt;Thomas Newenham Deane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Woodward\"&gt;Benjamin Woodward&lt;/a&gt;, at a cost of some \u00a321,000. This replaced three existing houses on Kildare Street and one on Leinster Street, which were demolished, giving an L-shaped new building, with an internal plan similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Club\"&gt;Reform Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pall%20Mall%2C%20London\"&gt;Pall Mall, London&lt;/a&gt;. The club committee had altered Deane and Woodward's original &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;Italian Gothic&lt;/a&gt; design, insisting on large &lt;a href=\"arch\"&gt;arch&lt;/a&gt;ed windows divided by thin &lt;a href=\"column\"&gt;column&lt;/a&gt;s, and the outcome was described as &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20architecture\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt;. The new building is adorned by \"whimsical beasts\".\nThe club had planned to move from the old to the new building in 1861, but on 11 November 1860 there was a disastrous fire at the old club house. Three maids died, and a fourth was saved by being at the time in the bedroom of the club accountant, from which she was rescued. All of the club's pictures and furniture and a library of fifteen thousand books were destroyed, and the club moved into its new building before completion.\nIn \"Parnell and his Island\" (1887), &lt;a href=\"George%20Moore%20%28novelist%29\"&gt;George Moore&lt;/a&gt; wrote scathingly of the Club: \nOverwhelmingly &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Ascendancy\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Irish\"&gt;Anglo-Irish&lt;/a&gt;, in 1900 the club was called by a member \"the only place in Ireland where one can enjoy decent &lt;a href=\"caviar\"&gt;caviar&lt;/a&gt;\". It has been estimated that at about this time only between two and six per cent of the Club's members were supporters of &lt;a href=\"Irish%20home%20rule%20movement\"&gt;Irish Home Rule&lt;/a&gt;. The most popular Dublin club for the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Parliamentary%20Party\"&gt;Irish Parliamentary Party&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"St%20Stephen%27s%20Green%20Club\"&gt;St Stephen's Green Club&lt;/a&gt;, while the Kildare Street Club was closely associated with the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Conservative%20Party\"&gt;Irish Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; and later the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Unionist%20Alliance\"&gt;Irish Unionist Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nRedevelopment and reuse.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"partition%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;partition of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; of 1921, and again after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the Kildare Street Club found itself in decline. In 1976 it merged with the &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20University%20Club\"&gt;Dublin University Club&lt;/a&gt;, thereafter sharing the premises of the latter at 17, &lt;a href=\"St%20Stephen%27s%20Green\"&gt;St Stephen's Green&lt;/a&gt;, under the name \"Kildare Street and University Club\". In 1967 the owner of the Kildare Street premises, Phoenix Assurance, sought permission to demolish half the building and replace it with an office block, having printed the notice in the newspapers in Irish. Dublin Corporation refused permission in June 1967. The next owners, Rampart Holdings, sought permission to redevelop the interior of the building in March 1971, and as only the exterior of the building was protected by a preservation order, this work was allowed to go ahead. The interior of the building was gutted, with the vaulted arcades, stone fireplaces, carved columns, staircase and flying buttresses as removed. The work began in 1971, and was finished by 1973, having converted the interior to accommodate 15,500 square feet of office space.\nThe building is now leased to the &lt;a href=\"State%20Heraldic%20Museum\"&gt;Heraldic Museum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genealogical%20Office\"&gt;Genealogical Office&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20fran%C3%A7aise\"&gt;Alliance fran\u00e7aise&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn fiction.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"literary%20genre\"&gt;genre&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20authors%20of%20new%20Sherlock%20Holmes%20stories\"&gt;new Sherlock Holmes stories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Tremayne\"&gt;Peter Tremayne&lt;/a&gt;'s \"The Affray at the Kildare Street Club\" appeared in \"The Mammoth Book of New Sherlock Holmes Adventures\" (1997). The story is set in 1873, when before going up to &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt; Holmes is visiting &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin\"&gt;Trinity College, Dublin&lt;/a&gt;. He solves the theft at the Kildare Street Club of a hair-brush from an &lt;a href=\"Peerage%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Irish duke&lt;/a&gt;."
