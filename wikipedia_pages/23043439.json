    "text": "Life without Death is a &lt;a href=\"cellular%20automaton\"&gt;cellular automaton&lt;/a&gt;, similar to &lt;a href=\"Conway%27s%20Game%20of%20Life\"&gt;Conway's Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"%20cellular%20automaton\"&gt; cellular automaton&lt;/a&gt; rules. In this cellular automaton, an initial seed pattern grows according to the same rule as in Conway's Game of Life; however, unlike Life, patterns never shrink. The rule was originally considered by , who called it \"Inkspot\"; it has also been called \"Flakes\". In contrast to the more complex patterns that exist within Conway's Game of Life, Life without Death commonly features &lt;a href=\"still%20life%20%28cellular%20automaton%29\"&gt;still life&lt;/a&gt; patterns, in which no change occurs, and \"ladder\" patterns, that grow in a straight line.\nRules.\nA cellular automaton is a type of model studied in &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"theoretical%20biology\"&gt;theoretical biology&lt;/a&gt; consisting of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as \"on\" and \"off\". A pattern in the Life without Death cellular automaton consists of an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: dead or alive. Equivalently, it can be thought of as an array of &lt;a href=\"pixel\"&gt;pixel&lt;/a&gt;s, each of which may be black and white; in the figures, the white pixels represent live cells, while the black pixels represent dead cells. Two of these cells are considered to be \"neighbors\" if they are vertically, horizontally, or diagonally adjacent.\nAny such pattern changes over a sequence of time steps by applying the following simple rules simultaneously to all cells of the pattern: every cell that was alive in the previous pattern remains alive, every dead cell that has exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive itself, and every other dead cell remains dead. That is, in the notation describing &lt;a href=\"%20cellular%20automaton\"&gt; cellular automaton&lt;/a&gt; rules, it is rule B3/S012345678: a live cell is born when there are 3 live neighbors, and a live cell survives with any number of neighbors.\nShoots and ladders.\n&lt;a href=\"Still%20life%20%28cellular%20automaton%29\"&gt;Still life&lt;/a&gt; patterns are common in Life without Death: if there is no dead cell with three live neighbors, a pattern will remain unchanging for all future time steps. However, because a cell, once alive, remains alive, the set of live cells grows &lt;a href=\"monotonic%20function\"&gt;monotonically&lt;/a&gt; throughout the evolution of a pattern, and there can be no &lt;a href=\"oscillator%20%28cellular%20automaton%29\"&gt;oscillators&lt;/a&gt; (patterns that cycle through a repeating sequence of shapes), &lt;a href=\"spaceship%20%28cellular%20automaton%29\"&gt;spaceships&lt;/a&gt; (patterns that keep the same shape but change position), or the other more complex patterns that exist within Conway's Game of Life.\nInstead, a common feature in Life without Death patterns is the presence of \"ladders\", patterns that grow in a straight line. A ladder will grow forever unless it runs into some other part of the pattern and is blocked or unless some more quickly-growing pattern overtakes it. The most common ladder pattern is shown in the figure; every twelve steps, the same shape appears at the tip of the ladder, four cells farther from the starting position of the ladder. The speed of the ladder's growth is therefore four cells per twelve steps, or, in Life notation, 4\"c\"/12\u00a0=\u00a0\"c\"/3; here \"c\" represents one unit of distance per time step. Another common pattern (called a \"parasitic shoot\" by Gravner and Griffeath) advances twice as quickly, at speed 2\"c\"/3, along the side of a ladder, eventually blocking the ladder and causing a chaotic explosion.\nVariant ladders of other speeds were discovered in 2000 by Dean Hickerson, along with some parasitic shoots that are slower than the most common 2\"c\"/3 one. Hickerson's ladders grow at speeds 4\"c\"/9, 4\"c\"/10, and 4\"c\"/13.\nSimulation of circuits.\nThe ladders in Life without Death can be used to simulate arbitrary &lt;a href=\"Boolean%20circuit\"&gt;Boolean circuit&lt;/a&gt;s: the presence or absence of a ladder in a certain position may be used to represent a Boolean signal, and different interactions between pairs of ladders, or between ladders and still life patterns, may be used to simulate the \"and\", \"or\", and \"not\" &lt;a href=\"logic%20gate\"&gt;gates&lt;/a&gt; of Boolean logic, as well as the points where two signals cross each other. Therefore, it is &lt;a href=\"P-complete\"&gt;P-complete&lt;/a&gt; to simulate patterns in the Life without Death rule, meaning it is unlikely that a &lt;a href=\"parallel%20algorithm\"&gt;parallel algorithm&lt;/a&gt; exists for a simulation significantly faster than that obtained by a naive parallel algorithm with one processor per cellular automaton cell and one time step per generation of the pattern.\nInfinite growth.\nSeed patterns in the form of balls of radius up to ten typically lead to a &lt;a href=\"still%20life%20%28cellular%20automaton%29\"&gt;still life&lt;/a&gt; pattern; however, Gravner suggests that the rule is supercritical, meaning that larger or less-symmetric seeds typically expand forever chaotically. Ladders are a frequent phenomenon on the boundaries of chaotic growth regions.\nA pattern in Life without Death is said to fill the plane with positive density if there is some radius \"r\" such that every cell of the plane is eventually within distance \"r\" of a live cell. The question of whether such infinite growth patterns exist was posed as an open problem by Gravner, Griffeath, and Moore. The chaotic patterns common in this rule may fill the plane, but they may also leave large empty rectangular regions framed by ladders, causing them to fail the density condition. However, in 2009 Dean Hickerson found diagonally expanding patterns that eventually settle down into high-period infinite growth, solving the open problem."
