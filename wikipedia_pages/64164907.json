    "text": "Junius S. Mobley (died January 2, 1904), also known as June Mobley, was a politician in &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina\"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. He was considered an ultra-radical, and was one of South Carolina's 1868 &lt;a href=\"Radical%20Republican\"&gt;Radical Republican&lt;/a&gt; members of the &lt;a href=\"Legislature\"&gt;Legislature&lt;/a&gt;. He reportedly became a preacher after the &lt;a href=\"Reconstruction%20era\"&gt;Reconstruction era&lt;/a&gt;. Mobley was a political leader during the Reconstruction era in South Carolina and was involved in the distribution of &lt;a href=\"ammunition\"&gt;ammunition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Freedman\"&gt;freedmen&lt;/a&gt;. He was part of the Union Brotherhood that replaced the &lt;a href=\"Union%20League\"&gt;Union League&lt;/a&gt; in 1872. Mobley was from &lt;a href=\"Union%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Union County, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. John Schreiner Reynolds wrote about Mobley and other &lt;a href=\"African%20American\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; legislators in 1905. He was not a fan of Mobley's, and described him as \"&lt;a href=\"mulatto\"&gt;mulatto&lt;/a&gt;\" and said he gave incendiary speeches causing bloodshed for the \"men of his own race\". He also referred to Mobley as a \"vicious and mouthy &lt;a href=\"Negro\"&gt;Negro&lt;/a&gt;\"."
