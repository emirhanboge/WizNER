    "text": "&lt;a href=\"S.S.D.%20Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt;, as the top &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club in &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt; in terms of &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; appearances and among the major ones in the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; football panorama, has a long history, which spans from its official foundation in 1900.\nThe club was refounded a number of times, most recently in 2019, and played in all the Italian professional leagues from Serie A to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C2\"&gt;Serie C2&lt;/a&gt; in different times. Its recent renaissance in the early 2000s brought the \"rosanero\" back to Serie A and later on to gain a spot in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in the club history, thus giving the club a worldwide popularity. The club currently plays in Serie B, Italy's second-tier football league. They won &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; qualification for three consecutive seasons from 2004 to 2007.\nFoundation and early years (1898\u20131927).\nThe club, in common with several other Italian teams, has its earliest roots in England. Football was originally brought to Palermo by English sailors of &lt;a href=\"cargo%20vessel\"&gt;cargo vessel&lt;/a&gt;s in the late 19th century who would play football at the muddy port in their spare time. There is some debate about the exact date the club was founded. Some authorities think it may have been as early as 1898 due to the existence of papers addressed to &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Whitaker%20%28ornithologist%29\"&gt;Joseph Whitaker&lt;/a&gt;, English consul in Palermo and originally believed to be first club president, about a Palermitan football team founded in the month of April of that year. Actually, there is a probable misinterpretation of some sources: in April 1897, in fact, the future founders of Palemo Calcio create the association \"Sport Club\". The most common and officially stated foundation date is 1 November 1900, as the Anglo Palermitan Athletic and Football Club. The club is thought to have been founded by Ignazio Majo Pagano, a young Palermitan colleague of Whitaker who had discovered football while at college in London, England, where the modern game of soccer originated from. The initial staff comprised 3 Englishmen and 9 natives of &lt;a href=\"Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt;, with Whitaker as honorary chairman, Edward De Garston as inaugural president, and with red and blue as the original team colours. The first recorded football match, played by the team on 30 December 1900, ended in a 5\u20130 defeat to an unidentified amateur English team. The first official match, played on 18 April 1901 against &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Messina%20Peloro\"&gt;Messina Football Club&lt;/a&gt; ended in a 3\u20132 win to the Palermitan side.\nThe staff foundations of the Palermo football organization was composed of 3 Englishmen and 9 natives of &lt;a href=\"Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt;, including:\nThe event was featured on November 1, 1900 in the frontpage of the &lt;a href=\"Giornale%20di%20Sicilia\"&gt;Giornale di Sicilia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Whitaker%20%28ornithologist%29\"&gt;Joseph Whitaker&lt;/a&gt; and Conte Giuseppe Airoldi were also actively involved in supporting the club, with the former serving as honorary chairman.\nThe first known football match, played by the team on December 30, 1900, ended in a 5\u20130 defeat to an unidentified amateur English team. The foundation colours of the team were red and blue. The twelve players used to meet and train them on a football field located in \"Via Notarbartolo\", of Whitaker's property. The first official match, played on April 18, 1901 against &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Messina%20Peloro\"&gt;Messina Football Club&lt;/a&gt; ended in a 3\u20132 win to the Palermitan side. From 1905 onwards the two clubs competed in the &lt;a href=\"Whitaker%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Whitaker Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt;, this was competed three times, Palermo won the competition once.\nIn 1907, the club changed its name to Palermo Foot-Ball Club, and the team colours were changed to the current pink and black; some sources state that the club colours were changed due to an accident which happened when washing the old red and blue shirts, while others (including &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo%23Colours%20and%20badge\"&gt;an official letter&lt;/a&gt; from the time) state that the colours are poetically intended to represent &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20%28taste%29%23Bitterness\"&gt;bitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sweetness\"&gt;sweet&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1908 until the final one in 1914, Palermo also played in the \"&lt;a href=\"Lipton%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Lipton Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt;\", not to be confused with the &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas%20Lipton%20Trophy\"&gt;Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, also organized by English businessman &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Lipton\"&gt;Sir Thomas Lipton&lt;/a&gt;. The competition saw them face off against &lt;a href=\"S.S.C.%20Napoli\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;; Palermo won the competition three times, including a 6\u20130 victory in 1912. Football activity in Palermo then halted until 1918 because of the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn February 16, 1919 the club name was changed to U.S. Palermo, the club was refounded by a committee of young university students and sportsmen with &lt;a href=\"baron\"&gt;baron&lt;/a&gt;e Sergio as president, just after World War I. In 1920, Palermo competed in and won the &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Federale%20Siciliana\"&gt;Coppa Federale Siciliana&lt;/a&gt;. For the rest of the early 1920s the club competed in the Campionato Lega Sud reaching the semi-finals in 1924, before being knocked out when facing &lt;a href=\"Taranto%20Sport\"&gt;Audace Taranto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Roma\"&gt;Alba Roma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"S.S.C.%20Napoli\"&gt;Internaples&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly league prominence (1927\u20131943).\nWith the ratification of the \"Carta di Viareggio\" of 1926, the \"Prima Divisione 1926-1927\", in which Palermo participated, became the prodromer of the current second level of the Italian football championship, being managed for the first time by the \"Direttorio Divisioni Superiori\" also for the South Italy: the Sicilians, however, played only nine football matches, because President Colombo had to withdraw the team due to financial problems, on December 10 of the same season. The first team of the city then became Vigor Palermo, that it was of the future Palermo' sport manager Tot\u00f2 Vilardo, who, after the championship of the \"Seconda Divisione 1927-1928\", became the third series, the equivalent today's &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C\"&gt;Serie C&lt;/a&gt;, changed its name to \"Palermo Football Club\" and took on the rosanero colors, making a merger with the old company on July 15, 1928. President became Conte Liotta di Lemos. On August 15, the company is a point of a share capital of one hundred thousand lire, thanks to a subscription led by Vincenzo Florio. After three presidents in the short term of a year, the company began to be administered by Barone Bordonaro di Gebbiarossa, who resigned in 1931 to take up motor racing. The \"barone\" is responsible for the commissioning of a new coat of arms, made in the Futurist style by the Palermo painter Giuseppe \"Pippo\" Rizzo.\nThe new Palermo was admitted on September 2 at the \"Campionato Meridionale 1928-1929\", which put a place in the new Serie B championship: the club placed third in the Sicilian sub-rig of group D, but was introduced in the next round for the FIGC resolution. Also in this phase the Palermo, arrived second, arrived made to pass from office. Arrived at the semi-finals, in the mini standings of group A, Palermo, together with Cagliari, Foggia and Lecce, played the first place for the final and, after having fought for a long time for that, came first on equal points with Lecce. It was therefore necessary to play a play-off for the final and to have the best were the Lecce players, set 1\u20130 in the neutral pitch of Naples. The promotion was then obtained the following year, thanks also to 15 goal striker &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Radice\"&gt;Carlo Radice&lt;/a&gt;.\nPalermo then got off to a great start in Serie B, almost gaining promotion during its first season with a third-place finish, only three points behind &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Bari\"&gt;Bari&lt;/a&gt;. The following season it gained promotion and the Serie B championship, with Radice scoring 27 of the 50 goals for Palermo.\nFor its first season in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;, the club moved to a new stadium named \"Stadio Littorio\" (Lictorian Stadium) in the Favorita neighbourhood, today known as &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Renzo%20Barbera\"&gt;Stadio Renzo Barbera&lt;/a&gt;. The opening match was played there on January 24, 1932 against &lt;a href=\"Atalanta%20B.C.\"&gt;Atalanta&lt;/a&gt;, with Palermo winning 5\u20131. It took Palermo a couple of years to find its footing in the league, but by &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A%201934-35\"&gt;1934\u201335&lt;/a&gt; the club finished 7th, cementing its place as a well-established side. The next season however the club relegated to Serie B.\nDown in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; Palermo spent three consecutive seasons finishing in 7th position. Notably for Sicilian football, the league featured all three major regional teams, Palermo, Messina and Catania; it was also the first time Palermo played against &lt;a href=\"Calcio%20Catania\"&gt;Calcio Catania&lt;/a&gt; on a national scale; their rivalry would then become known as the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20derby\"&gt;Sicilian derby&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot considering the 1-0 Palermo win in a Reserve League match in 1929, the first official game between the two sides was played in Catania during the &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia%201935-36\"&gt;Coppa Italia 1935\u201336&lt;/a&gt;, and ended in a 1\u20130 win for the home side. The first derby in a domestic league was featured only a few months later, on November 1, 1936 at the Stadio Littorio and ended in a 1\u20131 tie, with Catania being supported by only eight people attending the match; Palermo got the better of Catania later in the season though, with a 1\u20130 victory.\nIn 1936 the &lt;a href=\"Fascism\"&gt;fascist&lt;/a&gt; regime forced Palermo to change its colours to yellow and red, after the official ones of the local municipality. Meanwhile, economical troubles arose: causing even the imposition of a 10 &lt;a href=\"Italian%20lira\"&gt;lire&lt;/a&gt; meat tax in an attempt to finance the club. However Palermo's fourth season for back down in the league was a troublesome one, as in 1940 it was expelled by the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Italian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; because of financial problems. A merger with Unione Sportiva Juventina Palermo brought to the foundation of Unione Sportiva Palermo-Juventina, which entered &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C\"&gt;Serie C&lt;/a&gt; in 1941 and played with light blue colours. In 1942 the club returned to Serie B and switched back to its original colours. In 1943, however, chairman Beppe Agnello was forced to retire the club from the league following the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; events.\nPost-War Palermo (1946\u20131970).\nAfter having won the war Sicilian championship, the Palermo, as a Serie B company, was invited to play in the south-central round of the \"Divisione Nazionale 1945-1946\", the first and last non-single group championship since 1929. In the meantime each reference to Juventina had fallen and the denomination was once again Unione Sportiva Palermo. Re-admitted to the category of belonging, in the 1947\u20131948 season Palermo won the &lt;a href=\"1947-48%20Serie%20B%23Girone%20C\"&gt;girone C of the Serie B championship&lt;/a&gt; and obtained the promotion: in that team they played players like the Czechoslovakian &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Cestm%C3%ADr%20Vycp%C3%A1lek\"&gt;\u010cestm\u00edr Vycp\u00e1lek&lt;/a&gt; and the Italians Gaetano Conti, &lt;a href=\"Carmelo%20Di%20Bella\"&gt;Carmelo Di Bella&lt;/a&gt; and Aurelio Pavesi De Marco. The president was Stefano La Motta, who at the beginning of the season, after taking office on 1 July 1947, had declared: \"I will be President for a season, the time to bring Palermo back to Serie A\". He was speaking and the helm of the society passed to Giuseppe Guzzardella, although the main financier was Prince &lt;a href=\"Raimondo%20Lanza%20di%20Trabia\"&gt;Raimondo Lanza di Trabia&lt;/a&gt;, who a few years later became the president himself. Meanwhile, Palermo finished 11th the &lt;a href=\"1948-49%20Serie%20A\"&gt;following season in Serie A&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to several good performances, such as a vamp of two goals against &lt;a href=\"Grande%20Torino\"&gt;Grande Torino&lt;/a&gt;. The prince brought several valuable players to Palermo such as &lt;a href=\"Helge%20Bron%C3%A9e\"&gt;Helge Bron\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"%C5%9E%C3%BCkr%C3%BC%20G%C3%BClesin\"&gt;\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc G\u00fclesin&lt;/a&gt; and emerging coaches such as &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Viani\"&gt;Giuseppe Viani&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1951-52%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1951-1952&lt;/a&gt; the rosanero fought long for first place, but a final drop brought them back to 11th position. The rosanero stayed six consecutive seasons in the top flight and the relegation of &lt;a href=\"1953-54%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1953-1954&lt;/a&gt; came only after the playoffs salvation against &lt;a href=\"SPAL\"&gt;SPAL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Udinese%20Calcio\"&gt;Udinese&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe relegation was followed by a phase of profound reorganization, which involved all levels: the season of political presidents was inaugurated with &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Fasino\"&gt;Mario Fasino&lt;/a&gt;. Among the many new players purchased, &lt;a href=\"Enzo%20Benedetti\"&gt;Enzo Benedetti&lt;/a&gt; also arrived, who will become the captain of the Palermo team from 1955, after his first landing in Sicily, to 1962. In the following years, Palermo became a team that alternated Serie A promotions with relegations in Serie B (Club Yo-yo). One of the symbol players of this period was the former &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate\"&gt;River Plate&lt;/a&gt; striker &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Vernazza\"&gt;Santiago Vernazza&lt;/a&gt;, a fans' idol thanks to 54 goals in 121 total games which also make him the third in the all-time scorer list of Palermo. In the summer of 1960, Palermo participated for the first time in international competitions: in June at its first and last &lt;a href=\"Cup%20of%20the%20Alps\"&gt;Cup of the Alps&lt;/a&gt;, in July at the first of two &lt;a href=\"Mitropa%20Cup\"&gt;Mitropa Cup&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Palermo at the time succeeded in enhancing several players destined for a good career, such as &lt;a href=\"Tarcisio%20Burgnich\"&gt;Tarcisio Burgnich&lt;/a&gt; or goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Anzolin\"&gt;Roberto Anzolin&lt;/a&gt; who was then sold to &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus F.C.&lt;/a&gt;. The good corporate relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Turin\"&gt;Turin&lt;/a&gt; club is also witnessed by the passages of other players such as &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Furino\"&gt;Giuseppe Furino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Mattrel\"&gt;Carlo Mattrel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Causio\"&gt;Franco Causio&lt;/a&gt;. The peak under the sporting profile arrived in the &lt;a href=\"1961-62%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1961-62 Serie A&lt;/a&gt;, when the rosanero reached the 8th place, gaining prestigious results, such as a historic 2\u20134 away victory against Juve in Turin, on February 18, 1962. In the same year the first Sicilian derbies were played in the top flight with &lt;a href=\"Calcio%20Catania\"&gt;Catania&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"1962-63%20Serie%20A\"&gt;following edition&lt;/a&gt; Palermo failed to repeat and relegated to Serie B. In those years there were Casimiro Vizzini president and Tot\u00f2 Vilardo sports manager: Vilardo, the company's all-round secretary, was nicknamed The football wizard. At the end of the 1962\u20131963 season Vilardo was disqualified for life for an illegal attempt: he asked to the referee &lt;a href=\"Concetto%20Lo%20Bello\"&gt;Concetto Lo Bello&lt;/a&gt; the Bari's win on the last day of the Serie B championship, so that once the Apulian freshman was promoted would be bought the player Jos\u00e9 Ferdinando Puglia, healing the coffers of the rosanero company.\nIn 1968, with the transformation of the football club into a joint-stock company, Palermo changed its name to Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Calcio Palermo and moreover, in that year, the team returned in Serie A in the &lt;a href=\"1967-68%20Serie%20B\"&gt;1967-68 Serie B&lt;/a&gt;, with the former player and coach Carmelo Di Bella. In December of the new season, Palermo took part in its second and last Mitropa Cup and, therefore, in its third and last participation in a European competition. The following international experience will be lived 37 years later, in 2005 (&lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;).\nMixed times (1970\u20132001).\n&lt;a href=\"Renzo%20Barbera\"&gt;Renzo Barbera&lt;/a&gt; took over the club on May 4, 1970, becoming the new chairman; he would go on to be remembered as one of the greatest chairmen in the club's history. After 1973, Palermo played exclusively in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; for a long period time. Despite their lower league status, Palermo were still able to garner some success in the cup this period, reaching the &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Italian Cup&lt;/a&gt; final in 1974, against &lt;a href=\"Bologna%20F.C.%201909\"&gt;Bologna&lt;/a&gt;, Palermo lost on penalty shoot-outs after a 1\u20131 tie, with the Bologna goal, a penalty, scored during injury time in the second half.\nTheir name was modified again to Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Calcio Palermo during 1977. The club's second &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt; final, under coach &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Veneranda\"&gt;Fernando Veneranda&lt;/a&gt;, was reached in 1979; the game was lost 2\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt; after extra time, with the equaliser goal for the opponents curiously scored again during injury time, as happened five years before.\nOn March 7, 1980 Barbera sold the club to constructor Gaspare Gambino, following a five-points deduction imposed by the Football Federation due to a &lt;a href=\"match%20fixing\"&gt;match fixing&lt;/a&gt; scandal which involved Palermo midfielder &lt;a href=\"Guido%20Magherini\"&gt;Guido Magherini&lt;/a&gt;, then disqualified for 3 years and a half. In 1984 Palermo relegated to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C1\"&gt;Serie C1&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in its history, but promptly returned to Serie B one year later. The &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B%201985-86\"&gt;1985\u201386&lt;/a&gt; season which ended in the summer was however the last for Palermo, as the club, after a struggling saving from relegation, was expelled by the federation because of financial problems. the summer of 1987, after a year without professional football in Palermo, the club was refounded, bearing the current name, and began to play down from &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C2\"&gt;Serie C2&lt;/a&gt;, which was promptly won.\nA return to Serie B occurred in 1991, but lasted only a year. Palermo won the Serie C1 championship in 1993: that season, the league featured numerous other Sicilian clubs including Messina, Catania, &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Giarre%20Calcio\"&gt;Giarre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Siracusa%20Calcio%201924\"&gt;Siracusa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Acireale\"&gt;Acireale&lt;/a&gt;, with the latter promoted to Serie B together with Palermo. The \"rosanero\" stayed back up in Serie B for four seasons, and in 1994 wrote a piece of history for themselves with a 1\u20130 away win against &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt; second round.\nIn the 1990s, the &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B%201995-96\"&gt;1995\u20131996&lt;/a&gt; season was the highlight for Palermo, obtaining a seventh place after having fought hard for promotion, and even appearing in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia after eliminating &lt;a href=\"Parma%20F.C.\"&gt;Parma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vicenza%20Calcio\"&gt;Vicenza&lt;/a&gt; among others, with a team mostly composed of Palermitan footballers and coached by Palermo-born &lt;a href=\"Ignazio%20Arcoleo\"&gt;Ignazio Arcoleo&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the following season ended with relegation to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C1\"&gt;Serie C1&lt;/a&gt;. In 1997 Palermo played one of the worst season in its history, as they were due to be relegated to the Serie C2 division after a dramatic and shocking defeat in a play-off against &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Battipagliese\"&gt;Battipagliese&lt;/a&gt;; however Palermo was later saved by the federation due to the expulsion of &lt;a href=\"A.S.D.%20Ischia%20Benessere%20%26amp%3B%20Sport\"&gt;Ischia Isolaverde&lt;/a&gt;, another Serie C1 team.\n&lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Roma\"&gt;AS Roma&lt;/a&gt; chairman &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Sensi\"&gt;Franco Sensi&lt;/a&gt; bought the team on March 3, 2000, but the Palermo, in 1999\u20132000, missed a spot in the promotion playoffs. However, Palermo won group B of &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C1\"&gt;Serie C1&lt;/a&gt; 2000-2001 and got promoted to Serie B the next year, after a hard fight against fellow islanders Messina, reached at the top of the table just at the last match-day.\nBack in Serie A (2001\u20132005).\nIn the summer of 2002, after a quiet Serie B season ended in mid-table place, Palermo was sold by Sensi to retail trade entrepreneur &lt;a href=\"Maurizio%20Zamparini\"&gt;Maurizio Zamparini&lt;/a&gt; in a 15 million &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; bid. The former &lt;a href=\"S.S.C.%20Venezia\"&gt;Venezia&lt;/a&gt; owner brought in various players, including several ones from his past club, such as &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Santana\"&gt;Mario Santana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kewullay%20Conteh\"&gt;Kewullay Conteh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stefano%20Morrone\"&gt;Stefano Morrone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arturo%20Di%20Napoli\"&gt;Arturo Di Napoli&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 2002\u201303 season was the first of the Zamparini era: the club went through two managers that season, &lt;a href=\"Ezio%20Glerean\"&gt;Ezio Glerean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daniele%20Arrigoni\"&gt;Daniele Arrigoni&lt;/a&gt;, the former being fired only after the first league matchday, a 4\u20132 loss to &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Ancona\"&gt;Ancona&lt;/a&gt;, before arriving at &lt;a href=\"Nedo%20Sonetti\"&gt;Nedo Sonetti&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to help Palermo climb the league table. However, Palermo missed out on promotion to Serie A on the final day of the season, after a 3\u20130 away defeat to &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Lecce\"&gt;Lecce&lt;/a&gt;, who obtained the last promotion place. Palermo ended in fifth place, and Sonetti was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Empoli%20F.C.\"&gt;Empoli&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href=\"Silvio%20Baldini\"&gt;Silvio Baldini&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo%20season%202003-04\"&gt;2003\u201304 campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nZamparini was ambitious and reinforced the team with top signings such as &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Toni\"&gt;Luca Toni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lamberto%20Zauli\"&gt;Lamberto Zauli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eugenio%20Corini\"&gt;Eugenio Corini&lt;/a&gt;, and promising youngsters &lt;a href=\"Simone%20Pepe\"&gt;Simone Pepe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Gasbarroni\"&gt;Andrea Gasbarroni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Terlizzi\"&gt;Christian Terlizzi&lt;/a&gt;. However, Baldini was fired in January 2004, after a shocking home defeat to &lt;a href=\"Salernitana%20Calcio%201919\"&gt;Salernitana&lt;/a&gt; followed by public attacks from the head coach directed to the team chairman. Palermo, in third place at the time and reinforced still further with signings of &lt;a href=\"Fabio%20Grosso\"&gt;Fabio Grosso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Filippini\"&gt;Antonio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emanuele%20Filippini\"&gt;Emanuele Filippini&lt;/a&gt;, replaced Baldini with &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Guidolin\"&gt;Francesco Guidolin&lt;/a&gt;. The \"rosanero\" ended its season winning the Serie B title season on goal difference over &lt;a href=\"Cagliari%20Calcio\"&gt;Cagliari&lt;/a&gt;, with Luca Toni finishing the league top-scorer by some distance, with 30 goals in 45 matches.\nThe &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo%20season%202004-05\"&gt;2004\u201305 season&lt;/a&gt; was the first back in Serie A for the Palermo club since 1973. The event was well welcomed by the team supporters, as the club managed to sell all the 33,000 home stadium seats reserved to local fans as season tickets. Palermo ended the season with an excellent sixth place, allowing it to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%202005-06\"&gt;2005\u201306&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in its history. &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Toni\"&gt;Luca Toni&lt;/a&gt; broke the Palermo's Serie A scoring record by notching up 20 league goals.\nEuropean years (2005\u20132013).\nAfter two successful seasons in Sicily, Francesco Guidolin resigned as coach and &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Delneri\"&gt;Luigi Delneri&lt;/a&gt; was appointed to replace him for the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo%20season%202005-06\"&gt;2005\u201306 season&lt;/a&gt;, the first in a European competition in Palermo's history. During the summer football market, Luca Toni was sold to &lt;a href=\"ACF%20Fiorentina\"&gt;ACF Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"%E2%82%AC\"&gt;\u20ac&lt;/a&gt;10\u00a0m and a couple of young internationals, &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Caracciolo\"&gt;Andrea Caracciolo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Ayodele%20Makinwa\"&gt;Stephen Ayodele Makinwa&lt;/a&gt;, were signed to replace him. The team had a good start in the new season, most notably with an exciting 3\u20132 win against &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Internazionale%20Milano\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; and a successful UEFA Cup debut against &lt;a href=\"Anorthosis%20Famagusta%20FC\"&gt;Anorthosis Famagusta&lt;/a&gt;, defeated 6\u20131 on aggregate (2-1 and 4-0). Palermo successively won the group stage, finishing above &lt;a href=\"RCD%20Espanyol\"&gt;RCD Espanyol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lokomotiv%20Moscow\"&gt;Lokomotiv Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maccabi%20Petah%20Tikva%20F.C.\"&gt;Maccabi Petah Tikva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Br%C3%B8ndby%20IF\"&gt;Br\u00f8ndby IF&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite good European form, Palermo was not able to keep up its form in the league; Delneri was consequently fired in January 2006 following a 2\u20131 home defeat to &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Siena\"&gt;Siena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Papadopulo\"&gt;Giuseppe Papadopulo&lt;/a&gt; was appointed to replace him. He made his debut at the helm of Palermo with a sensational 3\u20130 win to &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt; in the Coppa Italia quarter-final return leg, taking Palermo through to the semi-final round for the third time in its history; they eventually went out to &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Roma\"&gt;AS Roma&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"away%20goals%20rule\"&gt;away goals rule&lt;/a&gt;, the score being 2\u20132 on aggregate. Palermo was also eliminated from European by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Schalke%2004\"&gt;FC Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt; in a 3-1 aggregate loss, after having defeated &lt;a href=\"SK%20Slavia%20Praha\"&gt;SK Slavia Praha&lt;/a&gt; in the round of 32. Palermo ended the season in eighth place, and thus was expected to play the 2006 &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Intertoto Cup&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to the &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A%20scandal%20of%202006\"&gt;Serie A scandal of 2006&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;FIGC&lt;/a&gt; stated they would not enter Palermo into the Intertoto Cup. In the meanwhile, Francesco Guidolin left &lt;a href=\"AS%20Monaco%20FC\"&gt;AS Monaco&lt;/a&gt; to re-join Palermo at Papadopulo's place.\nAfter the verdicts penalized numerous clubs, Palermo's overall position for that season was elevated to fifth, meaning they had qualified for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%202006-07\"&gt;2006\u201307 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In the transfer window, Palermo spent millions adding players to their squad, including &lt;a href=\"Aimo%20Diana\"&gt;Aimo Diana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Bresciano\"&gt;Mark Bresciano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A1bio%20Simpl%C3%ADcio\"&gt;F\u00e1bio Simpl\u00edcio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amauri%20Carvalho%20de%20Oliveira\"&gt;Amauri&lt;/a&gt;, but sold World Cup winner &lt;a href=\"Fabio%20Grosso\"&gt;Fabio Grosso&lt;/a&gt; to Internazionale. The events led several football pundits to tip Palermo to do well in the season ahead. A very exciting start saw Palermo sitting on top of the Serie A table in September 2006 after beating Catania 5\u20133 at home in the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20derby\"&gt;Sicilian derby&lt;/a&gt;. Another notable victory was a 2\u20130 away win to &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Giuseppe%20Meazza\"&gt;San Siro stadium&lt;/a&gt;. The team started well also in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; by knocking out &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;. However, this time around the group stage proved to be more difficult than the previous year, and Palermo finished last in a group that contained &lt;a href=\"Celta%20de%20Vigo\"&gt;Celta de Vigo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eintracht%20Frankfurt\"&gt;Eintracht Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fenerbah%C3%A7e%20SK\"&gt;Fenerbah\u00e7e SK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn February 2, 2007 Palermo was involved in a controversial away &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20derby\"&gt;Sicilian derby&lt;/a&gt;, suspended for 30 minutes during the second half and followed by violence outside the &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Angelo%20Massimino\"&gt;Catania stadium&lt;/a&gt; in which policeman &lt;a href=\"Filippo%20Raciti\"&gt;Filippo Raciti&lt;/a&gt; was killed by a small explosive launched by a Catania &lt;a href=\"ultras\"&gt;hooligan&lt;/a&gt;. This was followed by a two-weeks stop to all football leagues and national team matches in the whole country. Successively to these events Palermo, then clearly third-placed, did not manage to achieve a single victory, and dropped down to sixth position in the Serie A. Club chairman &lt;a href=\"Maurizio%20Zamparini\"&gt;Maurizio Zamparini&lt;/a&gt; became more critical of Guidolin and finally sacked him on April 23, 2007 following a 3\u20134 home defeat to third-last placed &lt;a href=\"Parma%20F.C.\"&gt;Parma&lt;/a&gt; which extended the run of poor results to 11 games without a single win. Assistant coach &lt;a href=\"Renzo%20Gobbo\"&gt;Renzo Gobbo&lt;/a&gt; and youth team coach &lt;a href=\"Rosario%20Pergolizzi\"&gt;Rosario Pergolizzi&lt;/a&gt;, appointed as &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%20manager\"&gt;caretaker coaches&lt;/a&gt; at Guidolin's place, led the team for two matches, a 2\u20131 away win at &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Livorno%20Calcio\"&gt;Livorno&lt;/a&gt; in their debut which ended the negative run and two further defeats, including an upset 3\u20132 away loss against last-placed team &lt;a href=\"Ascoli%20Calcio%201898\"&gt;Ascoli&lt;/a&gt;, already relegated to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; at the time, which left the \"rosanero\" in seventh place, the last &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; spot, only three points above &lt;a href=\"Atalanta%20B.C.\"&gt;Atalanta&lt;/a&gt;. The events led Zamparini to revoke Guidolin's dismissal and call him back for the remaining two matches. Guidolin's return brought two victories, to &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Siena\"&gt;Siena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Udinese%20Calcio\"&gt;Udinese&lt;/a&gt;, ending the season in fifth place, obtaining thus qualification to the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%202007-08\"&gt;UEFA Cup 2007-08&lt;/a&gt; for the third consecutive time and breaking its previous record of 53 points of two years before. On May 31, 2007 Palermo chairman Maurizio Zamparini announced &lt;a href=\"Stefano%20Colantuono\"&gt;Stefano Colantuono&lt;/a&gt; as new \"rosanero\" coach for the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo%20season%202007-08\"&gt;2007\u201308 season&lt;/a&gt;. The first two signings for the new season, midfielder &lt;a href=\"Giulio%20Migliaccio\"&gt;Giulio Migliaccio&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Atalanta%20B.C.\"&gt;Atalanta&lt;/a&gt; and goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Samir%20Ujkani\"&gt;Samir Ujkani&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"R.S.C.%20Anderlecht\"&gt;Anderlecht&lt;/a&gt;, were announced on June 8. Contemporarily, team captain &lt;a href=\"Eugenio%20Corini\"&gt;Eugenio Corini&lt;/a&gt;, whose contract was due to expire within a few days, announced he was going to leave Palermo. Palermo's moves in the summer market included notable signings such as &lt;a href=\"Bo%C5%A1ko%20Jankovi%C4%87\"&gt;Bo\u0161ko Jankovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fabrizio%20Miccoli\"&gt;Fabrizio Miccoli&lt;/a&gt; to replace &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Caracciolo\"&gt;Andrea Caracciolo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"David%20Di%20Michele\"&gt;David Di Michele&lt;/a&gt;, sold to &lt;a href=\"U.C.%20Sampdoria\"&gt;Sampdoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Torino%20F.C.\"&gt;Torino&lt;/a&gt; respectively. A fairly unimpressive start in the season, including a shock &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; elimination against &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; minnows &lt;a href=\"FK%20Mlada%20Boleslav\"&gt;FK Mlada Boleslav&lt;/a&gt;, however convinced Zamparini to sack Colantuono after a crush 5\u20130 loss to &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;, re-calling Guidolin at the helm of the \"rosanero\". Guidolin's fourth spell as Palermo boss proved to be even more unsuccessful, as Palermo struggled in the league, falling down to thirteenth place with concerns of being unexpectedly involved in the relegation battle. A 3\u20132 home loss to &lt;a href=\"Genoa%20C.F.C.\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt;, the third in a row for Palermo, followed by Guidolin's controversial attacks against the supporting fanbase and the club management, brought in to Colantuono being reinstated as \"rosanero\" boss on March 24, 2008.\nColantuono was confirmed as Palermo boss for the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20U.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo%20season\"&gt;2008\u201309 season&lt;/a&gt;. During the summer transfer market, club stars like &lt;a href=\"Amauri\"&gt;Amauri&lt;/a&gt;, Andrea Barzagli and Cristian Zaccardo were sold. New signings included former and current Italian internationals &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Amelia\"&gt;Marco Amelia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fabio%20Liverani\"&gt;Fabio Liverani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Nocerino\"&gt;Antonio Nocerino&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Rosanero\" started their season with a disappointing 2\u20131 home loss to &lt;a href=\"Lega%20Pro%20Prima%20Divisione\"&gt;Lega Pro Prima Divisione&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Ravenna%20Calcio\"&gt;Ravenna&lt;/a&gt; in the Third Round of the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt;. After just one game from the new campaign, a 3\u20131 loss to &lt;a href=\"Udinese%20Calcio\"&gt;Udinese&lt;/a&gt;, Zamparini sacked Colantuono, and the head coach role was given to &lt;a href=\"Davide%20Ballardini\"&gt;Davide Ballardini&lt;/a&gt;. With Ballardini as head coach, Palermo ended the season with a respectable eighth place, and also won its first &lt;a href=\"Campionato%20Nazionale%20Primavera\"&gt;Campionato Nazionale Primavera&lt;/a&gt; national title, under the guidance of youth coach &lt;a href=\"Rosario%20Pergolizzi\"&gt;Rosario Pergolizzi&lt;/a&gt;. After the end of the season, Palermo dismissed Ballardini from the coaching post following disagreements with the board, and replaced him with &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Zenga\"&gt;Walter Zenga&lt;/a&gt;, whose appointment from Sicilian arch-rivals Catania was greeted with surprise and dismay from supporters of both parties. Zenga's reign, however, lasted only 13 games, as he was dismissed on 23 November 2009 due to poor performances, ironically after a 1\u20131 home tie to Sicilian rivals and Zenga's former team, Catania, with former Lazio boss &lt;a href=\"Delio%20Rossi\"&gt;Delio Rossi&lt;/a&gt; being appointed at his place. Under the tutelage of Delio Rossi, results dramatically improved, and Palermo established a record of seven consecutive home wins, and also achieved prestigious results such as two 2\u20130 wins against Italian giants &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; and Juventus. The latter win, achieved on February, led Palermo to climb over the \"Bianconeri\" in fourth place, establishing the \"Rosanero\" as serious contenders for a Champions League spot, which they ultimately lost to &lt;a href=\"U.C.%20Sampdoria\"&gt;Sampdoria&lt;/a&gt; by only one point. Such season also launched new emerging stars such as midfielder &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Pastore\"&gt;Javier Pastore&lt;/a&gt; and goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Sirigu\"&gt;Salvatore Sirigu&lt;/a&gt;, who went on to become integral part of their respective international teams.\nThe new season started with Delio Rossi still in charge of the club: &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Kj%C3%A6r\"&gt;Simon Kj\u00e6r&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edinson%20Cavani\"&gt;Edinson Cavani&lt;/a&gt; left the club, and a few more promising youngsters were signed (most notably Argentine &lt;a href=\"Ezequiel%20Mu%C3%B1oz\"&gt;Ezequiel Mu\u00f1oz&lt;/a&gt; and the Slovene duo of &lt;a href=\"Armin%20Ba%C4%8Dinovi%C4%87\"&gt;Armin Ba\u010dinovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Josip%20Ili%C4%8Di%C4%87\"&gt;Josip Ili\u010di\u0107&lt;/a&gt;), plus more experienced acquisitions such as forwards &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Maccarone\"&gt;Massimo Maccarone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mauricio%20Pinilla\"&gt;Mauricio Pinilla&lt;/a&gt;. The 2010\u201311 season also marked Palermo's return into continental football in the form of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;. Palermo reached their third Coppa Italia finals after defeating Milan 4\u20133 on aggregate on 10 May 2011, losing 3\u20131 to &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Internazionale&lt;/a&gt; in the final. For the 2011\u201312 season, Delio Rossi was replaced by former &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Chievo%20Verona\"&gt;Chievo&lt;/a&gt; boss &lt;a href=\"Stefano%20Pioli\"&gt;Stefano Pioli&lt;/a&gt;, who was, however, sacked before the Serie A kickoff after being eliminated by Swiss minnows &lt;a href=\"FC%20Thun\"&gt;FC Thun&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt; third preliminary round. In a somewhat surprise move, Pioli was replaced by under-19 team coach &lt;a href=\"Devis%20Mangia\"&gt;Devis Mangia&lt;/a&gt;, with no managerial experience other than at youth team and minor league level; despite that, Mangia turned Palermo fortunes by leading the \"Rosanero\" in fifth place thanks to an impressive string of six consecutive home wins, thus deserving a long-term deal at the club. A string of poor results, however, led Palermo to three consecutive defeats, including elimination from the Coppa Italia and a disappointing loss in the Sicilian derby, persuading Zamparini to replace Mangia with the more experienced &lt;a href=\"Bortolo%20Mutti\"&gt;Bortolo Mutti&lt;/a&gt;. Palermo arrived 16th in that season.\nZamparini's later years and Serie B return (2013\u20132018).\nFor the 2012\u201313 season, Zamparini came with another staff revolution, appointing &lt;a href=\"Giorgio%20Perinetti\"&gt;Giorgio Perinetti&lt;/a&gt; as the new director of football and &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Sannino\"&gt;Giuseppe Sannino&lt;/a&gt; as the manager, both coming from Siena. Significant sales included &lt;a href=\"Federico%20Balzaretti\"&gt;Federico Balzaretti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giulio%20Migliaccio\"&gt;Giulio Migliaccio&lt;/a&gt;, who left the \"Rosanero\" as part of a complete restructuring. The season started in unfashionable manner, leading to the sacking of Sannino and his replacement with &lt;a href=\"Gian%20Piero%20Gasperini\"&gt;Gian Piero Gasperini&lt;/a&gt;; days later, Perinetti resigned and &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Lo%20Monaco\"&gt;Pietro Lo Monaco&lt;/a&gt; was named as the new club managing director. Results did not improve, however, and Palermo descended into the relegation zone; a controversial handling of the January transfer window and even more negative results led to Gasparini being sacked for &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Malesani\"&gt;Alberto Malesani&lt;/a&gt;, and called back after three games, the return of Perinetti in place for Lo Monaco, and ultimately a second dismissal for Gasperini who was replaced by a re-hired Sannino. Despite a slight increase in results, Palermo ended its season in 18th place, being thus relegated to Serie B after nine consecutive seasons in the top flight.\nFor the new Serie B campaign, Zamparini appointed former Milan and &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy international&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href=\"Gennaro%20Gattuso\"&gt;Gennaro Gattuso&lt;/a&gt; as the new manager, despite him having little prior managerial experience; he was sacked in September 2013, the 28th sacked manager in 11 years. Fortune was reversed rather rapidly, however, as Palermo regained promotion back to Serie A for the 2014\u201315 season thanks to a 1\u20130 victory over Novara on 3 May 2014 under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Iachini\"&gt;Giuseppe Iachini&lt;/a&gt;, who took the reins over after Gattuso was sacked due to poor results, with the \"Rosanero\" responding with a record-breaking Serie B season ended with 86 points, one more than previous record holders Juventus, &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Chievo%20Verona\"&gt;Chievo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Sassuolo%20Calcio\"&gt;Sassuolo&lt;/a&gt; (all of them in the 22-team Serie B format).\nDue to his successful results, Palermo confirmed Iachini as head coach for the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2014\u201315 Serie A&lt;/a&gt; season, and agreed a contract extension until June 2016 with him. A new director of football, &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Ceravolo\"&gt;Franco Ceravolo&lt;/a&gt; (formerly a scout for Juventus), was instead named in place of Perinetti, but was removed (with Iachini being instead confirmed) after a dismal season start led Zamparini to intervene in order to turn the team's fortunes. The non-playing staff changes at Palermo turned out to be ultimately successful, with Palermo winning many games afterwards and entering the fight for a UEFA Europa League spot thanks to the all-Argentine striking force of &lt;a href=\"Paulo%20Dybala\"&gt;Paulo Dybala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franco%20V%C3%A1zquez\"&gt;Franco V\u00e1zquez&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2015\u201316 season&lt;/a&gt;, Palermo started their season without Dybala after the youngster moved to Juventus; the \"Rosanero\" therefore relied on senior striker &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Gilardino\"&gt;Alberto Gilardino&lt;/a&gt; to play as a partner of V\u00e1zquez. On 10 November 2015, coach Giuseppe Iachini was sacked due to disappointing results in the beginning of the season; he was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Davide%20Ballardini\"&gt;Davide Ballardini&lt;/a&gt;. Ballardini only lasted for 7 matches with Palermo before fired by Zamparini after spectacularly falling out with Palermo's players. Palermo captain &lt;a href=\"Stefano%20Sorrentino\"&gt;Stefano Sorrentino&lt;/a&gt; reported that during 1\u20130 victory against &lt;a href=\"Hellas%20Verona%20F.C.\"&gt;Hellas Verona&lt;/a&gt;, the coach did not speak to Palermo players neither before nor after the match. &lt;a href=\"Fabio%20Viviani%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Fabio Viviani&lt;/a&gt; became Palermo's caretaker manager in a 0\u20134 defeat against &lt;a href=\"Genoa%20C.F.C.\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt;. Rosanero hired &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Barros%20Schelotto\"&gt;Guillermo Barros Schelotto&lt;/a&gt; as a new manager. Schelotto, however, did not have the necessary paperwork to be registered as Palermo coach, so his position was taken by &lt;a href=\"Campionato%20Nazionale%20Primavera\"&gt;Primavera&lt;/a&gt; youth team coach Giovanni Bosi during a 4\u20131 win over Udinese. Schelotto was registered as a team manager during that match. &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Tedesco\"&gt;Giovanni Tedesco&lt;/a&gt; named as Palermo's sixth coach of the season while Schelotto is still waiting for the paperwork. On 10 February 2016, following Schelotto's resignation after UEFA refusal to hand him a valid European coaching authorization, Palermo announced to have promoted \"Primavera\" youth coach Giovanni Bosi as new head coach, with Tedesco as his technical collaborator. Five days later, Bosi was sacked, and Iachini was re-appointed as manager. On 10 March, Iachini was sacked once again, as &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Novellino\"&gt;Walter Novellino&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as his replacement. Novellino was then sacked on 11 April. Davide Ballardini was rehired a day later for the ninth managerial change that season. On 15 May, Palermo escaped relegation on the last day of the league with the necessary win over Hellas Verona 3\u20132, securing 16th place.\nFor the 2016\u201317 season, Zamparini re-appointed &lt;a href=\"Rino%20Foschi\"&gt;Rino Foschi&lt;/a&gt; as director of football; he however resigned after just a month in charge and was replaced by former Trapani director Daniele Faggiano. Most senior players such as Gilardino, Sorrentino, V\u00e1zquez and &lt;a href=\"Enzo%20Maresca\"&gt;Maresca&lt;/a&gt; were sold and mostly replaced with &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Diamanti\"&gt;Alessandro Diamanti&lt;/a&gt; plus a number of young and quasi-unknown foreign players. Ballardini, who was originally confirmed as head coach, left his position after a draw at &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; at the second matchday of the season and was replaced with Serie A newbie &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20De%20Zerbi\"&gt;Roberto De Zerbi&lt;/a&gt;. De Zerbi's stint as Palermo head coach ended in dismal as he was sacked following &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt; elimination at home against Serie B team &lt;a href=\"Spezia%20Calcio\"&gt;Spezia&lt;/a&gt;, and after seven league losses in a row, with former club captain &lt;a href=\"Eugenio%20Corini\"&gt;Eugenio Corini&lt;/a&gt; taking over. This was followed by Faggiano's resignations; his role was not filled as Zamparini announced his intention to operate in the January 2017 transfer market with the support of a number of consultants of his, mostly &lt;a href=\"Gianni%20Di%20Marzio\"&gt;Gianni Di Marzio&lt;/a&gt;, football agent Davor \u0106urkovi\u0107 and &lt;a href=\"Dario%20%C5%A0imi%C4%87\"&gt;Dario \u0160imi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; (who was successively officially announced as part of the club non-coaching staff). After two more defeats against relegation battle opponents &lt;a href=\"Empoli%20F.C.\"&gt;Empoli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Sassuolo%20Calcio\"&gt;Sassuolo&lt;/a&gt;, no major signing in the first half of January and eight points deep into relegation zone, Zamparini however decided to change his mind by appointing &lt;a href=\"Nicola%20Salerno%20%28sporting%20executive%29\"&gt;Nicola Salerno&lt;/a&gt; as new director of football.\nOn 27 February 2017, Zamparini stepped down as chairman of Palermo after 15 years in charge, announcing he had agreed in principle to sell his controlling stake to an unspecified Anglo-American fund, led by Italian-American &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Baccaglini\"&gt;Paul Baccaglini&lt;/a&gt; who was named new club president on 6 March.\nPalermo ended the season in 19th place, being relegated to Serie B. The takeover, originally scheduled to be finalized by 30 April 2017 and then delayed by 30 June, eventually collapsed after Zamparini, who in the meantime had appointed &lt;a href=\"Bruno%20Tedino\"&gt;Bruno Tedino&lt;/a&gt; as new head coach for the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Serie%20B\"&gt;2017\u201318 Serie B&lt;/a&gt; campaign, rejected the final offer he received from Baccaglini.

The \"Rosanero\" ended the first half of the season in first place; however, a streak of negative results and disagreements between Lupo and Zamparini led to the former's dismissal and replacement with &lt;a href=\"Aladino%20Valoti\"&gt;Aladino Valoti&lt;/a&gt;. As results did not improve, Tedino was ultimately dismissed as well and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Stellone\"&gt;Roberto Stellone&lt;/a&gt;, who however failed on winning promotion, ending the regular season in fourth place and eventually losing the playoff finals to &lt;a href=\"Frosinone%20Calcio\"&gt;Frosinone&lt;/a&gt;. The club also experienced a number of administrative issues which led to Zamparini appointing Giovanni Giammarva, an administrative expert from Palermo, as new president.\nNew ownerships, financial issues and Serie B exclusion (2018\u20132019).\nFor the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Serie%20B\"&gt;2018\u201319 Serie B&lt;/a&gt; season, Palermo found themselves forced to sell a number of players due to financial issues, with &lt;a href=\"Antonino%20La%20Gumina\"&gt;Antonino La Gumina&lt;/a&gt; sold to &lt;a href=\"Empoli%20F.C.\"&gt;Empoli&lt;/a&gt; for a reported fee of \u20ac9m and &lt;a href=\"Igor%20Coronado\"&gt;Igor Coronado&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sharjah%20FC\"&gt;Sharjah FC&lt;/a&gt; for \u20ac6m.
