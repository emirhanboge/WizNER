    "text": "Debt relief orders (DROs) are a simplified, quicker and cheaper alternative to bankruptcy as an &lt;a href=\"bankruptcy%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;insolvency&lt;/a&gt; measure in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, which came into effect in England and Wales on 6 April 2009, and are also offered in Northern Ireland.\nDebt relief orders are suitable for debtors who have relatively low liabilities, little surplus income and few assets; can (depending on eligibility) be a viable alternative to other insolvency measures, such as Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs), and when bankruptcy would be disproportionate; and allow vulnerable people trapped in debt to have a fresh start.\nIt is possible to apply for a DRO without attending court and the fee is \u00a390. The fee may be paid by installments prior to applying for the order. \nBackground.\nDebt relief orders were introduced under Chapter 4 of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunals%2C%20Courts%20and%20Enforcement%20Act%202007\"&gt;Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007&lt;/a&gt;, as a major amendment to the &lt;a href=\"Insolvency%20Act%201986\"&gt;Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/a&gt;, and minor amendments to the &lt;a href=\"Company%20Directors%20Disqualification%20Act%201986\"&gt;Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Employment%20Rights%20Act%201996\"&gt;Employment Rights Act 1996&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Schedule 20 of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunals%2C%20Courts%20and%20Enforcement%20Act%202007\"&gt;Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007&lt;/a&gt;, the consequences of debt relief orders is outlined.\nConsequences of the amendments to the &lt;a href=\"Insolvency%20Act%201986\"&gt;Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/a&gt; include:\nConsequences of the amendments to the &lt;a href=\"Insolvency%20Act%201986\"&gt;Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986&lt;/a&gt; include:\nConsequences of the amendments to the &lt;a href=\"Employment%20Rights%20Act%201996\"&gt;Employment Rights Act 1996&lt;/a&gt; include:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Minimal%20Asset%20Protection%20%28MAP%29\"&gt;Minimal Asset Protection (MAP)&lt;/a&gt; insolvency measure, introduced in &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Bankruptcy%20and%20Debt%20Advice%20%28Scotland%29%20Bill\"&gt;Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Bill&lt;/a&gt; on 11 June 2013, shares similarities with DROs but has different associated benefits, risks, and fees. In particular, the application cost was reduced from \u00a390 to \u00a350 during the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; (until September 31st 2020) in response to increased financial insecurity.\nEligibility.\nDebt relief orders are intended to provide debt relief for people in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland if:\nApplication process.\nA debt relief order is a form of insolvency, like bankruptcy, and will be subject to a public listing through the Insolvency Service website.\nDebt relief orders can only be completed by an approved intermediary and competent authorities. Approved intermediaries will be mainly experienced debt advisors attached to debt advice organisations such as &lt;a href=\"Citizens%20Advice\"&gt;Citizens Advice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"StepChange%20Debt%20Charity\"&gt;StepChange Debt Charity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thinkmoney\"&gt;Think Money&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"AdviceUK\"&gt;AdviceUK&lt;/a&gt; member. The approved intermediary can review the persons information, make a determination that they are eligible and appropriate for a DRO and file the DRO application online. Approved intermediaries will not charge a fee for completing or submitting an application although a fee will be payable to the Insolvency Service.\nThe full list of organisations approved by the Insolvency Service as competent authorities are listed on the .Gov.UK web site.\nUpon receipt of the application and payment of the fee, an Official Receiver may make the order, administratively, without the involvement of the court if it appears that the applicant meets the requirements.\nIf the Official Receiver becomes aware of information which means the debtor does not qualify for a DRO, the application will be refused. If this information comes to light after the DRO is made, the Official Receiver may revoke the DRO without reference to the Court. The effect of revoking a DRO will be to leave the debtor open to actions by his or her creditors. If a DRO is revoked the debtor cannot apply for another one within six years.\nOutcomes.\nDuring the 12-month period that a debt relief order is active, the applicant will:\nCertain activities by debtors subject to a DRO may result in an application to the Court for a Debt Relief Restrictions Order being refused. These include:\nIn addition certain more serious misconduct may result in criminal prosecution.\nData released in November 2014 shows the number of debt relief orders in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; between 2009 and 2013 was much lower than the average for the rest of England. The study was produced by New Policy Institute and funded by Trust for London."
