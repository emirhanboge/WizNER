    "text": "The March 1\u20133, 2018 nor'easter was a powerful &lt;a href=\"nor%27easter\"&gt;nor'easter&lt;/a&gt; that caused major impacts in the &lt;a href=\"Northeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;Northeastern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mid-Atlantic%20United%20States\"&gt;Mid-Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southeastern United States&lt;/a&gt;. It originated as the northernmost low of a &lt;a href=\"stationary%20front\"&gt;stationary front&lt;/a&gt; over the Midwest on March 1, which moved eastward into the Northeast later that night. A new low pressure system rapidly formed off the coast on March 2 as it slowly meandered near the coastline. It peaked later that day and brought hurricane-force winds to coastal &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; before gradually moving out to sea by March 3. Producing over of &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; in some areas, it was one of the most significant March snowstorms in many areas, particularly in &lt;a href=\"Upstate%20New%20York\"&gt;Upstate New York&lt;/a&gt;. In other areas, it challenged storm surge records set by other significant storms, such as &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Sandy\"&gt;Hurricane Sandy&lt;/a&gt;. It was unofficially named \"Winter Storm Riley\" by &lt;a href=\"The%20Weather%20Channel\"&gt;The Weather Channel&lt;/a&gt;. \nAlthough the most severe damage was caused by flooding as well as snow, unusually high tides and storm surges along the coast, wind and downed trees caused massive inland power outages, with the number of outages as high as 1.9 million at one point. By March 4, least 9 people were known to have been killed as a result of the storm, with 5 of them being killed by falling trees or branches. Recovery efforts were later hampered as a &lt;a href=\"March%206%E2%80%938%2C%202018%20nor%27easter\"&gt;second nor'easter&lt;/a&gt; began to impact the area just a few days after the first one struck.\nMeteorological history.\nA &lt;a href=\"stationary%20front\"&gt;stationary front&lt;/a&gt; was draped over the central &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on the last day of February 2018. During this time period, &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20North%20American%20winter%23Late%20February%20flooding\"&gt;dangerous flash flooding occurred&lt;/a&gt; as a result. On March 1, one of the northernmost lows split from the boundary and began tracking northwards. Tracking into colder air near the border between the U.S and Canada, snow broke out in the eastern half of the &lt;a href=\"Midwest\"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Weather%20Prediction%20Center\"&gt;Weather Prediction Center&lt;/a&gt; (WPC) began issuing storm summaries later that day. Overnight into the early morning hours of March 2, a new low formed and rapidly strengthened off the coast of &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, while snow began to slowly increase in coverage near &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and southern &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.\nRapid deepening of the low continued as it moved slowly westward, before it bottomed out around or so later that evening. Intrusion of cold air caused heavy wet &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; to break out closer to the coast, resulting in snow engulfing much of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Tri-State Area&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and areas further south. Winds also increased as the pressure gradient of the system increased, with gusts reaching as high as in some areas. Gradually, the storm also began to move out to sea, with the precipitation shield of the system receding from the coast. Consequently, by the early morning hours of March 3, the WPC terminated storm summaries on the storm after it moved far enough away from the East Coast, while also maintaining peak intensity. The system weakened over the next few days, before it split into two systems on March 5, one of which became a &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20European%20windstorm%20season%23Storm%20Felix\"&gt;hurricane-force low&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreparations and impact.\nMid-Atlantic.\n&lt;a href=\"Amtrak\"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt; suspended rail service along the &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Corridor\"&gt;Northeast Corridor&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, along with \"&lt;a href=\"Keystone%20Service\"&gt;Keystone Service&lt;/a&gt;\" trains between &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, on March 2 because of the storm. Over 4,000 flights were cancelled on March 2 due to the storm. Also because of the storm, over 2.2 million customers in the Northeast United States lost power.\nVirginia.\nThe storm brought rain and heavy winds to the &lt;a href=\"Hampton%20Roads\"&gt;Hampton Roads&lt;/a&gt; area on March 2.
