    "text": "The Bonesetter's Daughter is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"prologue\"&gt;prologue&lt;/a&gt; and two acts by &lt;a href=\"Stewart%20Wallace\"&gt;Stewart Wallace&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; by\n&lt;a href=\"Amy%20Tan\"&gt;Amy Tan&lt;/a&gt; based on her &lt;a href=\"novel\"&gt;novel&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Bonesetter%27s%20Daughter\"&gt;same name&lt;/a&gt;. It premiered on 13 September 2008 at the &lt;a href=\"War%20Memorial%20Opera%20House\"&gt;War Memorial Opera House&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Opera\"&gt;San Francisco Opera&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Commission%20%28art%29\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; the work.\nPlot.\n\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\" traces a Chinese-American woman's search for her own voice and identity as she grapples with her elderly mother's apparent dementia, her husband's ambivalent commitment, and her teen stepdaughters' hurtful self-absorption. Guided by a ghost of uncertain identity, she travels into the past and lives out portions of her mother's tragic youth, gaining insight, forgiveness, and strength.\nThe opera is set both in 1997 San Francisco, and in China and Hong Kong around the outbreak of World War II.\nShifting times and locales are linked by a recurring trio of women: American-born Ruth, a professional ghostwriter who scarcely speaks up for herself; her mother, LuLing, who appears both as a querulous old woman and as a selfish adolescent; and LuLing's childhood caretaker known as Precious Auntie, who appears both as a ghost and as the fiery young mother she once was.\nScenes.\nFor further details, see \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bonesetter%27s%20Daughter\"&gt;The Bonesetter's Daughter&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAnalysis.\nThe score folds authentic Chinese musical expression into an essentially Western idiom, just as the libretto incorporates Chinese themes\u2014such as the importance of family, and the power of ghosts and lucky charms\u2014within an American framework. That framework includes many popular references, including a wry jab at \"Medicare-approved\" nursing homes and reference to Ruth's profession as a ghostwriter, which her immigrant mother misconstrues literally to mean a transcriptionist for ghosts. Notably, the infamous &lt;a href=\"O.%20J.%20Simpson%20murder%20case\"&gt;O. J. Simpson murder trial&lt;/a&gt; of 1995 becomes the vehicle by which elderly LuLing remembers and narrates traumatic events from her adolescence in China, which are revealed as the crux of her conflicts with her daughter."
