    "text": "The Pepper Pot, also known as the Pepperpot, the Pepper Box or simply The Tower, is a &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Park%2C%20Brighton\"&gt;Queen's Park&lt;/a&gt; area of the English city of &lt;a href=\"Brighton%20and%20Hove\"&gt;Brighton and Hove&lt;/a&gt;. Designed and built in 1830 by architect &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Barry\"&gt;Charles Barry&lt;/a&gt; in the grounds of a &lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt; built for the owner of Queen's Park, it survived the villa's demolition and is now one of its only surviving remnants. Its original purpose is unknown\u2014several possible explanations have been given for its construction\u2014and it has had a wide variety of uses in the 20th century. It is now owned by Brighton and Hove City Council, and is protected as a Grade II listed building.\nHistory.\nQueen's Park was designed and laid out in 1824 in the east of Brighton, which had developed as a fashionable resort over the previous century as it developed a reputation as a healthy &lt;a href=\"spa%20town\"&gt;spa town&lt;/a&gt; patronised by the &lt;a href=\"George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Prince Regent&lt;/a&gt;, other members of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;British Royal Family&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Upper%20class\"&gt;high society&lt;/a&gt; in general. In 1825, Thomas Attree\u2014a property owner and developer in this part of Brighton\u2014bought the park (at that stage known as Brighton Park) from its first owner, and employed architect &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Barry\"&gt;Charles Barry&lt;/a&gt; to design a villa for him on the edge of the park. The Attree Villa, as it became known, stood in substantial grounds north of the park and was one of the earliest &lt;a href=\"Italianate%20architecture\"&gt;Italianate&lt;/a&gt; buildings in England. Barry designed the square building in the &lt;a href=\"Quattrocento\"&gt;Quattrocento&lt;/a&gt; style; it was intended to be one of several around the park, but no more were built. Between 1909 and 1966 it was a &lt;a href=\"Xaverian%20Brothers\"&gt;Xaverian Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; college, but it fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1972 despite being a Grade II* listed building.\nFew structural elements of the villa remain, but the Pepper Pot\u2014which originally stood in the western part of the grounds\u2014remains intact. It was built at the same time as the villa, but its original function is uncertain: theories include a &lt;a href=\"water%20tower\"&gt;water tower&lt;/a&gt; for the villa, a &lt;a href=\"Drain-waste-vent%20system\"&gt;vent&lt;/a&gt; for the network of large &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sanitary%20sewer\"&gt;sewer&lt;/a&gt;s beneath Brighton, an &lt;a href=\"observatory\"&gt;observatory&lt;/a&gt; or even a &lt;a href=\"folly\"&gt;folly&lt;/a&gt;. Research in 2011, based on a record in the \"Arcana of Science and Art\" (published in 1836), suggested that the tower stood above a well and housed a steam engine which drew the water out. Its name was given in the \"Arcana\" as \"Belvedere Tower\". Its present name, which has historically been used locally and has now been adopted more generally, makes reference to its shape.\nSince it passed out of Attree's ownership, the structure has had a remarkable variety of uses. George Duddell bought Attree's &lt;a href=\"Estate%20%28law%29\"&gt;estate&lt;/a&gt; in 1863, and used the Pepper Pot to print and publish his local newspaper, the \"Brighton Daily Mail\". Three years later, it (along with the park, the villa and all associated buildings) had passed to the Brighton Corporation, the equivalent of the present city council. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the military used the structure as an observation post. Later uses included the headquarters of a &lt;a href=\"Scout%20troop\"&gt;Scout troop&lt;/a&gt;, an artist's studio and\u2014after an extension was built in the base in the 1960s\u2014a public toilet.\nThe Pepper Pot was designated a Grade II listed building on 13 October 1952.\nArchitecture.\nThe Pepper Pot is a ten-sided, cylindrical structure, tall and standing on an octagonal base. It is topped by a &lt;a href=\"cupola\"&gt;cupola&lt;/a&gt; and a green metal urn. There are 11 &lt;a href=\"Corinthian%20order\"&gt;Corinthian columns&lt;/a&gt; around the exterior. The tower rises in four stages. The lowest is the octagonal &lt;a href=\"plinth\"&gt;plinth&lt;/a&gt; which was extended to the north in the 1960s when toilets were installed. The short second stage is circular; its upper boundary is defined by a &lt;a href=\"cornice\"&gt;cornice&lt;/a&gt;. The columns extend all the way up the third stage; at the top of this section, between each column, is a small window. An &lt;a href=\"entablature\"&gt;entablature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cornice\"&gt;cornice&lt;/a&gt; rest on top of the column and marks the division with the uppermost stage, which has 11 &lt;a href=\"pilaster\"&gt;pilaster&lt;/a&gt;s directly above the columns. Another entablature sits between the pilasters and the circular cupola.\nThe design is based on the &lt;a href=\"Choragic%20Monument%20of%20Lysicrates\"&gt;Choragic Monument of Lysicrates&lt;/a&gt; in Athens, which was widely copied by British &lt;a href=\"Neoclassical_architecture\"&gt;neoclassical architects&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe main building material was said to be cement by English Heritage in its listing description, but research undertaken during the 2011 restoration work discovered that the core of the Pepper Pot is made of a pioneering type of concrete known as \"Ranger's Artificial Stone\" or \"Ranger's Lime Concrete\"\u2014making it one of the oldest buildings in England to use this material. William Ranger, a builder from the nearby village of &lt;a href=\"Ringmer\"&gt;Ringmer&lt;/a&gt;, invented this in the early 19th century.\nRestoration plans.\nThe Friends of the Pepperpot group was formed in January 2010 to promote the conservation of the Pepperpot and try to get it back into use. In May 2011, Brighton and Hove City Council undertook a \u00a350,000 restoration of the exterior. In the same month, the Friends of the Pepperpot announced that three new uses were being considered for the building\u2014conversion into a &lt;a href=\"bed%20and%20breakfast\"&gt;bed and breakfast&lt;/a&gt;, a community centre or a caf\u00e9\u2014and that they were in negotiations with the city council about the possibility of taking over the ownership of the building. In September 2011, it was stated that more structural work was needed and that the final cost could be \u00a3100,000, or even more if the interior was restored. Heritage bodies such as &lt;a href=\"English%20Heritage\"&gt;English Heritage&lt;/a&gt;, The Georgian Group, The Regency Society and The &lt;a href=\"Landmark%20Trust\"&gt;Landmark Trust&lt;/a&gt; consulted with the Friends of the Pepperpot and the city council to decide what should happen."
