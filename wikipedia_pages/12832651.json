The League has deemed the product a \"patriotic game\" and will not include an option for players to play as &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; units. Players select from 17 Chinese characters from all walks of life; they must defend the country during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The game generated a great deal of attention from young Chinese gamers even before its release. Violence level is reduced and fighting is only shown in &lt;a href=\"miniature%20wargaming\"&gt;miniature&lt;/a&gt; form. In addition to this, killing other soldiers is prohibited in the game. The time frame depicted in the game is from 1937 to 1945."
