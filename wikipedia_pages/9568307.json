    "text": "Ngundu is a village in &lt;a href=\"Chivi%20District\"&gt;Chivi District&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Masvingo%20Province\"&gt;Masvingo Province&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-1950 Ngundu Halt was a stopping point for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Railways%20of%20Zimbabwe%23Rhodesia%20Railways\"&gt;Rhodesia Railways&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Road\"&gt;Road&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Engine\"&gt;Motor&lt;/a&gt; Service, or RMS. There was a small roof topped structure with a secure door where the &lt;a href=\"mailbag\"&gt;mailbag&lt;/a&gt; was dropped for &lt;a href=\"Triangle\"&gt;Triangle&lt;/a&gt; Estates and for other residents in the Lowveld. The road was tar strips on the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Victoria%2C%20Alberta\"&gt;Fort Victoria&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Masvingo\"&gt;Masvingo&lt;/a&gt;) - &lt;a href=\"Beitbridge\"&gt;Beit Bridge&lt;/a&gt; road, and dirt from the halt to Triangle. &lt;a href=\"Local%20bus\"&gt;Local bus&lt;/a&gt; services stopped there and small traders selling &lt;a href=\"corn%20on%20the%20cob\"&gt;corn on the cob&lt;/a&gt; and other travel-related foods did a brisk trade when the buses stopped.\nRufus Paul noted that it was a point at which there was a need for a &lt;a href=\"filling%20station\"&gt;filling station&lt;/a&gt; and a country store. He applied to the Native &lt;a href=\"Commissioner\"&gt;Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; for a permit to build both and homes for himself and his staff, the NC allowed this, and for a small annual rent, \u00a34.00, a four-&lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt; plot was allocated and Paul's Ngundu Store was born. This was about 1948.\nThere was a &lt;a href=\"drought\"&gt;drought&lt;/a&gt; in 1950. Many villagers were unable to reap for their household use, and they borrowed a bag of &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; (corn) at a time as required. All bar one (who had a good reason) paid their &lt;a href=\"loan\"&gt;loan&lt;/a&gt;s back, something that impressed the Pauls immensely. A bond had been created with the locals.\nThe store was nestled amongst m'sasa tree covered kopjies, and behind it was a huge drop into the lower &lt;a href=\"country\"&gt;country&lt;/a&gt; below. One could sit on a rock and observe the activities of the local folk as they went about their activities. There were many exotic flowering trees and flowers planted.\nRufus Paul was a Seventh-Day Adventist and the store was closed sunset Friday to sunset Saturday. Motorists who were short of fuel were given, free of charge, enough fuel to move on to the next filling station. Churches and schools run by the church were built with the aid of Rufus Paul. The store had a small clinic and a vehicle was on standby to ferry emergencies either to Lundi Mission, Chibi Clinic or Morgenster Mission, depending on their severity.\nThe store was sold in about 1970 to Norman Richards who subsequently sold it. The writer has not any knowledge of the current owner.\nNgundusberg resort was also created in 2020, 300m from Chiredzi turn off by the Mupasi Family Trust with the intention to sustain the vision of the Paul family, providing accommodation for the people travelling to the rest of Africa and carter for tourists coming to the largest inland lake of &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; (Tokwe-Mukosi)\nIt is now a complete little town, electricity laid on, and services such as &lt;a href=\"police%20station\"&gt;police station&lt;/a&gt;, primary and secondary schools are present."
