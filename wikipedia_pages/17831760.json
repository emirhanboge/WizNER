    "text": "Hebrew &lt;a href=\"punctuation\"&gt;punctuation&lt;/a&gt; is similar to that of &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; languages, &lt;a href=\"Modern%20Hebrew\"&gt;Modern Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; having imported additional punctuation marks from these languages in order to avoid the ambiguities sometimes occasioned by the relative paucity of such symbols in &lt;a href=\"Biblical%20Hebrew\"&gt;Biblical Hebrew&lt;/a&gt;.\nPunctuation.\nQuotation marks.\nWith most printed Hebrew texts from the early 1970s and before, opening quotation marks are low (as in &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;), and closing ones are high, often going above the letters themselves (as opposed to the &lt;a href=\"gershayim\"&gt;gershayim&lt;/a&gt;, which is level with the top of letters). An example of this system is .\nHowever, this distinction in Hebrew between opening and closing quotation marks has mostly disappeared, and today, quotations are most often punctuated as they are in English (such as ), with both quotation marks high. This is due to the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20keyboard\"&gt;Hebrew keyboard layout&lt;/a&gt;, which lacks the opening quotation mark \u2329\u201e\u232a, as well as to the lack in Hebrew of \u201c&lt;a href=\"quotation%20mark%23Curved%20quotes%20and%20Unicode\"&gt;smart quotes&lt;/a&gt;\u201d in certain word processing programs.\nIn addition, the quotation mark is often used for the similar looking but different \"&lt;a href=\"gershayim\"&gt;gershayim&lt;/a&gt;\" mark \u2329\u232a, as that too is absent from the &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20keyboard\"&gt;Hebrew keyboard&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeriod, question mark, exclamation mark, comma.\nPeriods (&lt;a href=\"full%20stops\"&gt;full stops&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"question%20mark\"&gt;question mark&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"exclamation%20mark\"&gt;exclamation mark&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"comma\"&gt;comma&lt;/a&gt;s are used as in English.\nA Hebrew period in a traditional &lt;a href=\"serif\"&gt;serif&lt;/a&gt; face usually looks like a tiny tilted square (a &lt;a href=\"geometric%20shapes\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;; \u25ca). This is also true for the dot part of the &lt;a href=\"question%20mark\"&gt;question mark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"exclamation%20mark\"&gt;exclamation mark&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20language\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;, which is also written from right to left, the question mark \u2329\u232a is mirrored right-to-left from the English question mark. (Some browsers may display the character in the previous sentence as a forward question mark due to font or text directionality issues.) &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20language\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; is also written right-to-left, but uses a question mark that appears on the page in the same orientation as the English \u2329?\u232a. Note that Hebrew commas are not mirrored - although that was once suggested (together with mirrored semi-colons, 'capital' letters, etc.) by a 19th century British minister called William Withers Ewbank.\nColon and \"\".\nStemming from Biblical Hebrew, a ' \u2329 \u232a is the equivalent of a period, and is used in some writings such as prayer books. Since a ' is absent from the &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20keyboard\"&gt;Hebrew keyboard layout&lt;/a&gt;, and looks very similar to the &lt;a href=\"colon%20%28punctuation%29\"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; \u2329:\u232a, a colon is often substituted for it.\nVertical bar and \"paseq\".\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"paseq\"&gt;paseq&lt;/a&gt;\" () \u2329\u232a originates from Biblical Hebrew. As it is not on a standard &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20keyboard\"&gt;Hebrew keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"vertical%20bar\"&gt;vertical bar&lt;/a&gt; \u2329|\u232a is often used instead. However, it is seldom if ever used in modern Israeli Hebrew, and is not mentioned on the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20the%20Hebrew%20Language\"&gt;Academy of the Hebrew Language&lt;/a&gt;'s guide to modern Hebrew punctuation. The height of the \"paseq\" depends on the font, but it is generally the same as the letter .\nLike much Biblical Hebrew punctuation, the meaning of the \"paseq\" is not known, although a number of hypotheses exist. The word itself means \"separator\", but this name was a medieval innovation by later Jews; the root does not exist in the Biblical Hebrew canon. James Kennedy, an English &lt;a href=\"hebraist\"&gt;hebraist&lt;/a&gt;, wrote a book about the \"paseq\" in which he hypothesized that it was an ancient mark serving the same purpose as the modern word &lt;a href=\"sic\"&gt;sic&lt;/a&gt; (in non-Latin texts). The &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Leningrad%20Codex\"&gt;Westminster Leningrad Codex&lt;/a&gt; contains over 500 \"paseq\"s; William Wickes, an influential scholar in this area, divide them into nine classes; &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Gesenius\"&gt;Wilhelm Gesenius&lt;/a&gt;, drawing on Wickes, divided them into five:\nAn example may be found in in the Westminster Leningrad Codex and many other manuscripts:\nHyphen and \"maqaf\".\nThe ' () \u2329\u232a is the Hebrew &lt;a href=\"hyphen\"&gt;hyphen&lt;/a&gt; \u2329-\u232a, and has virtually the same purpose for connecting two words as in English. It is different from the hyphen in its positioning (a hyphen is in the middle in terms of height, the ' is at the top) and it has a biblical origin, unlike many other &lt;a href=\"Modern%20Hebrew\"&gt;Modern Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; punctuation symbols, which have simply been imported from European languages.\nThe original purpose of the \"maqaf\" was to show that two words should be considered one for the purpose of &lt;a href=\"dagesh\"&gt;dagesh&lt;/a&gt; placement, vowels, stress (\"\u1e6da\u02bfam\", ), and &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20cantillation\"&gt;cantillation&lt;/a&gt;. This use continues into the present beyond reprintings of Biblical texts; for example, the &lt;a href=\"sheet%20music\"&gt;sheet music&lt;/a&gt; for modern Hebrew songs, such as , are normally printed with them. The \"\" is well-used in Hebrew typography; most books and newspapers use it and have the hyphens higher than one would find in English. In typed documents, however, it is frequently not used because before the 2010s it was absent from most keyboards or cumbersome to type. As a consequence, a standard English hyphen \u2329-\u232a is most often used in online writings. This situation can be compared to that of users writing in Latin alphabets using the easily available &lt;a href=\"hyphen-minus\"&gt;hyphen-minus&lt;/a&gt; \u2329-\u232a over &lt;a href=\"hyphen\"&gt;hyphen&lt;/a&gt; \u2329\u2010\u232a, &lt;a href=\"minus%20sign\"&gt;minus&lt;/a&gt; \u2329\u2212\u232a, &lt;a href=\"dash%23en%20dash\"&gt;en dash&lt;/a&gt; \u2329\u2013\u232a, and &lt;a href=\"dash%23Em%20dash\"&gt;em dash&lt;/a&gt; \u2329\u2014\u232a.\nAs of 2010s, it is possible to insert \"\" using in most common operating systems: AltGr-Minus in desktop Linux and Windows 8 and higher according to the SI 1452 standard, &lt;a href=\"Option%20key\"&gt;Option key&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=\"Backslash\"&gt;Backslash&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"MacOS\"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tap%20%28touchscreen%20gestures%29\"&gt;long tap&lt;/a&gt; on the minus in the iOS Hebrew keyobard and in &lt;a href=\"Gboard\"&gt;Gboard&lt;/a&gt; on Android systems.\nBrackets/parentheses.\nBrackets or parentheses, \u2329(\u232a and \u2329)\u232a are the same in Hebrew as in English. Since Hebrew is written from right to left, \u2329)\u232a becomes an opening bracket, and \u2329(\u232a a closing bracket, the opposite from English, which is written left to right.\nIsraeli currency.\nThe &lt;a href=\"shekel%20sign\"&gt;shekel sign&lt;/a&gt; () is the currency sign for the Israeli currency (the &lt;a href=\"Israeli%20new%20shekel\"&gt;Israeli new shekel&lt;/a&gt;), in the way &lt;a href=\"dollar%20sign\"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pound%20sign\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"euro%20sign\"&gt;\u20ac&lt;/a&gt; exist for other currencies. The shekel sign, like the dollar sign \u2329$\u232a, is usually placed to the left of the number (so ', rather than '), but since Hebrew is written from right to left, the symbol is actually written after the number. It is either not &lt;a href=\"space%20%28punctuation%29\"&gt;separated&lt;/a&gt; from the preceding number, or is separated only by a &lt;a href=\"thin%20space\"&gt;thin space&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike the dollar sign, the new shekel sign is not used that often when handwriting monetary amounts, and is generally replaced by the abbreviation (standing for \"\", lit. \"new shekel\"). The new shekel sign can be typed on desktop Linux and Windows 8 and higher systems using the combination AltGr-4 according to the SI 1452 standard.\nThe short-lived &lt;a href=\"Israeli%20old%20shekel\"&gt;Israeli old shekel&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, which symbol was , is rarely referred to in Israeli texts; both due to its lifespan of only five years and the fact that due to hyperinflation it lost value daily, so that referring to a value in Israeli old shekels, even in retrospective writing, is essentially meaningless without knowing the exact time the figure was quoted. As prices changed so rapidly, advertising of the time predominately used dollars; when the shekel was referred to at all, it was with the letter S or its full Hebrew name\u2014; although certain banks, such as &lt;a href=\"Bank%20Leumi\"&gt;Bank Leumi&lt;/a&gt;, used the letter to refer to it on checks, as well as the Latin letters \"I.S.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Israeli%20pound\"&gt;Israeli pound&lt;/a&gt; was the Israeli Currency until 1980. Its sign is I\u00a3, and its abbreviation is .\n\"Geresh\" and \"gershayim\".\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"geresh\"&gt;geresh&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2329\u232a, is the Hebrew equivalent of a period in abbreviations (e.g. abbrev.), in addition to being attached to Hebrew letters to indicate sounds like &lt;a href=\"hard%20and%20soft%20G\"&gt;soft \"g\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ch%20%28digraph%29\"&gt;\"ch\"&lt;/a&gt; in foreign names such as Charles () and Jake (). The \"&lt;a href=\"gershayim\"&gt;gershayim&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2329\u232a, is a Hebrew symbol indicating that a sequence of characters is an acronym, and is placed \"before\" the last character of the word. Owing to a &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20keyboard\"&gt;Hebrew keyboard&lt;/a&gt;'s having neither a \"geresh\" nor \"gershayim\", they are usually replaced online with, respectively, the visually similar apostrophe \u2329'\u232a and quotation mark \u2329\"\u232a. The quotation mark and apostrophe are higher than the \"geresh\" and \"gershayim\": where the latter are placed level with the top of Hebrew letters, the apostrophe and quotation marks are above them.\nSome Hebrew-specific &lt;a href=\"font\"&gt;font&lt;/a&gt;s (fonts designed primarily for Hebrew letters), such as &lt;a href=\"David%20%28font%29\"&gt;David&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Narkisim\"&gt;Narkisim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FrankRuehl\"&gt;FrankRuehl&lt;/a&gt;, do not feature the apostrophe and quotation marks as such but use the \"geresh\" and \"gershayim\" to substitute for them.\nMathematics.\nMathematical expressions are written in Hebrew using the same symbols as in English, including &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20numerals\"&gt;Western numerals&lt;/a&gt;, which are written left to right. The only variant that exists is an &lt;a href=\"alternative%20plus%20sign\"&gt;alternative plus sign&lt;/a&gt;, which is a plus sign which looks like an inverted &lt;a href=\"capital%20letter\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; T. &lt;a href=\"Unicode\"&gt;Unicode&lt;/a&gt; has this symbol at position U+FB29 \"Hebrew letter alternative plus sign\" (\ufb29). The reason for this practice is that it avoids the writing of a symbol \"+\" that looks like a &lt;a href=\"Christian%20cross\"&gt;Christian cross&lt;/a&gt;.\nReversed \"nun\".\n&lt;a href=\"Reversed%20Nun\"&gt;Reversed \"nun\"&lt;/a&gt; (also called inverted \"nun\", \"nun hafukha\", or \"nun menuzzeret\") is a rare character found in two Biblical Hebrew texts. Although in Judaic literature it is known as \"nun hafukha\" (\"reversed \"&lt;a href=\"nun%20%28letter%29\"&gt;nun&lt;/a&gt;\"\"), it does not function as any sort of letter in the text. It is not part of a word, and it is not read aloud in any way. It is simply a mark that is written, and is therefore a punctuation mark, not a letter. Also, it is surrounded by space.\nWhile it depends on the particular manuscript or printed edition, it is found in nine places: twice in the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Numbers\"&gt;Book of Numbers&lt;/a&gt; (prior to and after Numbers 10:34-36), and seven times in &lt;a href=\"Psalm\"&gt;Psalm&lt;/a&gt; 107. It is uncertain today what it was intended to signify.\nIn many manuscripts, it does not even resemble a transformed \"nun\" at all, and when it does, it sometimes appears reversed (as mentioned above), sometimes inverted, and sometimes turned through 180\u00b0. Other times it appears to look like the letter Z.\nHebrew points (vowels).\nThese signs (points, \"\") indicate voweling or some other aspects of the pronunciation of a letter or word. While in Modern Hebrew they are not generally used outside poetry and children's books, a vowel point or other diacritic is occasionally added to resolve ambiguity.\nOne of these ', the ', is no longer used in Hebrew, even though it is routinely used in Yiddish spelling (as defined by &lt;a href=\"YIVO\"&gt;YIVO&lt;/a&gt;).\nHebrew cantillation marks.\nThe cantillation marks ( \"\") have a very specialized use. They are only found in printed Hebrew texts of &lt;a href=\"Tanakh\"&gt;Tanakh&lt;/a&gt; to be used as a guide for chanting the text, either from the printed text or, in the case of the public reading of the &lt;a href=\"Torah\"&gt;Torah&lt;/a&gt;, to be memorized along with vowel marks as the &lt;a href=\"Sefer%20Torah\"&gt;Sefer Torah&lt;/a&gt; includes only the letters of the text without cantillation or vowel marks. Outside the &lt;a href=\"Tanakh\"&gt;Tanakh&lt;/a&gt;, the cantillation marks are not used in modern spoken or written Hebrew at all. The cantillation marks provide a structure to sentences of Tanakh similar to that provided by punctuation marks."
