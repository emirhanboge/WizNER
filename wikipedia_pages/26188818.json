The club is currently playing in the &lt;a href=\"Thai%20League%203\"&gt;Thai League 3&lt;/a&gt; Bangkok metropolitan region.\nHistory.\nTheir first season in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Thai%20Division%202%20League%20Bangkok%20%26amp%3B%20field%20Region\"&gt;2010 Thai Division 2 League Bangkok &amp; field Region&lt;/a&gt; almost proved successful. A victory in their last game over &lt;a href=\"Bangkok%20F.C.\"&gt;Bangkok F.C.&lt;/a&gt; would have earned North Bangkok College a top two finish and a chance to enter the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Regional%20League%20Division%202\"&gt;2010 Regional League Division 2&lt;/a&gt; playoffs. North Bangkok College were leading Bangkok F.C. 1\u20130 in their final game but with 15 minutes left to play, Bangkok F.C. equalized to earn a 1\u20131 draw and at the same time clinch top place in the league. North Bangkok College finished 5th in the table.\nIn 2011, the club finished as runner-up to Kasetsart in the Bangkok Division 2 and qualified for the Division 2 playoffs. The timing of the playoffs coincided with the 2011 floods so the Horsemen were forced to seek alternative home venues as theirs was flooded. It did not bode well as North Bangkok only won one game and collected six points.\nIn the following season, North Bangkok could not regain their 2011 form and finished 6th in the Bangkok league and season 2017 they have made the history they have won the &lt;a href=\"Thai%20League%204\"&gt;Thai League 4&lt;/a&gt;."
