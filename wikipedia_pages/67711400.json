    "text": "King Tut Drive-In is a &lt;a href=\"drive-in\"&gt;drive-in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"American%20cuisine\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"barbecue\"&gt;barbecue&lt;/a&gt; restaurant located on North Eisenhower Drive in &lt;a href=\"Beckley%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Beckley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory and description.\nKing Tut's Drive-In was established in 1945 by its namesake the Tutweiller family who transferred ownership of the restaurant to the family of current owner Dave McKay a decade later in 1955. McKay, who used to work at the restaurant making pizza for 25&lt;a href=\"Penny%20%28United%20States%20coin%29\"&gt;\u00a2&lt;/a&gt; an hour, operated the restaurant with his brother Jeff for a while until the latter moved to Maryland.\nThe restaurant includes an awning over the parking area, a building that houses the kitchen and a large &lt;a href=\"marquee%20%28structure%29\"&gt;marquee&lt;/a&gt; at the front of the parking lot that serves as the menu. Typical of drive-in restaurants, the servers (called \"curb girls\" by McKay) fill orders and bring food out to the customer's cars.\nOn September 25, 2020, the restaurant announced that it would be closing temporarily due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. It re-opened almost 2 weeks later on August 6.\nMenu.\nThe restaurant's menu is \"large\" and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner including &lt;a href=\"Submarine%20sandwich%23Hoagie\"&gt;hoagies&lt;/a&gt;, sandwiches, pot roast, chicken livers and &lt;a href=\"swiss%20steak\"&gt;swiss steak&lt;/a&gt; with their most popular items being the barbecue, hot dogs, specialty salads and pizza. Desert items include a root-beer float, milkshakes and three kinds of pie (&lt;a href=\"Apple%20pie\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coconut%20pie\"&gt;coconut&lt;/a&gt; and either chocolate or cherry cream)."
