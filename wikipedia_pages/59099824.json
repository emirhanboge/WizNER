July/August 1193) was &lt;a href=\"Emir%20of%20Mecca\"&gt;Emir of Mecca&lt;/a&gt; at least three times between 1175 and 1192, in opposition to his brother &lt;a href=\"Mukaththir\"&gt;Mukaththir&lt;/a&gt;. He belonged to the &lt;a href=\"sharif\"&gt;sharif&lt;/a&gt;ian dynasty known as the Hawashim.\nDa'ud succeeded to the Emirate after the death of his father &lt;a href=\"Isa%20ibn%20Fulaytah\"&gt;Isa&lt;/a&gt; on 2 Sha'ban 570 &lt;a href=\"Hijri%20year\"&gt;AH&lt;/a&gt; (). Less than a year later, on the night of 15 Rajab 571 AH (), he was deposed by his brother Mukaththir. In Dhu al-Hijjah of that year (June/July 1176) the Iraqi \"&lt;a href=\"amir%20al-hajj\"&gt;amir al-hajj&lt;/a&gt;\" Tashtakin fought Mukaththir and captured Mecca. He gave custodianship of the Emirate to &lt;a href=\"Qasim%20ibn%20Muhanna\"&gt;Qasim ibn Muhanna&lt;/a&gt;, the Emir of Medina. After three days Qasim surrendered the Emirate to Da'ud, after the latter agreed to Tashtakin's conditions, among which were that he abolish the \"mukus\" (non-Islamic taxes). However, reports indicate that Mukaththir was again Emir the following year, in 572 AH (1176/1177).\nAt some point the Emirate returned to Da'ud, as &lt;a href=\"al-Dhahabi\"&gt;al-Dhahabi&lt;/a&gt; reports that he was Emir in 587 AH (1191/1192). He writes that in that year Da'ud looted the &lt;a href=\"Kaaba\"&gt;Kaaba&lt;/a&gt; of its wealth and stripped the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Stone\"&gt;Black Stone&lt;/a&gt; of its silver collar. When the \"amir al-hajj\" arrived he deposed Da'ud and installed Mukaththir as Emir. According to al-Dhahabi, Da'ud spent the rest of his days at &lt;a href=\"Nakhla%20%28Saudi%20Arabia%29\"&gt;Nakhlah&lt;/a&gt;, where he died in Rajab 589 AH (July/August 1193). Najm Ibn Fahd writes that he died on Monday, 14 Sha'ban 589 AH (23 August 1193). He had a son named Ahmad, as evidenced by a gravestone seen by al-Fasi."
