    "text": "Jean-Luc Pepin, (November 1, 1924 \u2013 September 5, 1995) was a &lt;a href=\"Canadians\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; academic, politician and &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Cabinet\"&gt;Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; minister.\nPolitical biography.\nPepin was a political science &lt;a href=\"professor\"&gt;professor&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Ottawa\"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; when he was first elected to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada\"&gt;House of Commons of Canada&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1963%20Canadian%20federal%20election\"&gt;1963 election&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (MP) from &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1965 to 1972, he served in the cabinets of &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Prime Ministers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lester%20B.%20Pearson\"&gt;Lester B. Pearson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Trudeau\"&gt;Pierre Trudeau&lt;/a&gt; in various capacities, including Minister of Mines and Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce overseeing the decision to have Canada adopt the &lt;a href=\"metric%20system\"&gt;metric system&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe lost his &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20seat\"&gt;seat&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1972%20Canadian%20federal%20election\"&gt;1972 election&lt;/a&gt;, and retired from public life until 1975 when Trudeau appointed him to chair the Anti-Inflation Board.\nIn 1977, he and former &lt;a href=\"Premier%20of%20Ontario\"&gt;Premier of Ontario&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Robarts\"&gt;John Robarts&lt;/a&gt; were appointed to head the \"Task Force on Canadian Unity\". This task force was created by the federal government as a response to the election of the \"&lt;a href=\"Parti%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois\"&gt;Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois&lt;/a&gt;\", which seeks &lt;a href=\"Quebec%20sovereignty%20movement\"&gt;political independence for Quebec&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1976%20Quebec%20general%20election\"&gt;1976 provincial election&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe task force issued a report in 1979 that recommended entrenching language rights in the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Constitution\"&gt;Canadian Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, and for the reduction of federal powers in all areas but economic management. The Task Force also recommended the replacement of the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Senate of Canada&lt;/a&gt; with a \"Council of the Federation\" whose members would be appointed by provincial governments, and to grant the provinces a say in appointments to the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Supreme Court of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these recommendations were rejected by the Government of Canada, and did not make their way into the new Constitution that was enacted in 1982.\nAfter a seven-year absence, Pepin returned to the House of Commons in the &lt;a href=\"1979%20Canadian%20federal%20election\"&gt;1979 election&lt;/a&gt;. When the Liberals returned to power after the &lt;a href=\"1980%20Canadian%20federal%20election\"&gt;1980 election&lt;/a&gt;, he became &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Transport%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;Minister of Transport&lt;/a&gt; until 12 August 1983. In that position he was responsible for\nLater, he became a &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20State%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;Minister of State&lt;/a&gt; to the Department of External Affairs and &lt;a href=\"Minister%20responsible%20for%20the%20Francophonie%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;Minister responsible for La Francophonie&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater life.\nFollowing heart surgery, he retired from politics in 1984, and returned to academia as a fellow at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Ottawa\"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;'s Institute on Public Policy.\nIn 1977, he was made a Companion of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Order of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. He was bestowed the title, The &lt;a href=\"Right%20Honourable\"&gt;Right Honourable&lt;/a&gt; in 1992.\nArchives.\nThere is a Jean-Luc Pepin &lt;a href=\"fonds\"&gt;fonds&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Library%20and%20Archives%20Canada\"&gt;Library and Archives Canada&lt;/a&gt;."
