    "text": "Felicia elongata is a &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial plant&lt;/a&gt; of up to high that is assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Asteraceae\"&gt;daisy family&lt;/a&gt;. It has stiff, oval, opposing leaves with one distinctive vein and entire margin. The wide flower heads are very conspicuous in colour, white with a dark purple zone at the base of the ray florets and an orange-yellow disc. Flowering occurs from late August to September, or if the rains arrive late, sometimes October. It is a rare species that is restricted to the Saldanha Bay area. It is sometimes called Saldanha felicia or tricolour felicia in English, and driekleurblommetjie in &lt;a href=\"Afrikaans\"&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Felicia elongata\" is an upright &lt;a href=\"Perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"herbaceous%20plant\"&gt;herbaceous plant&lt;/a&gt; with a woody base, of up to about high. Its leaves are &lt;a href=\"Leaf%23Arrangement%20on%20the%20stem\"&gt;oppositely arranged&lt;/a&gt; along the stem, &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23ovate\"&gt;oval&lt;/a&gt; in outline and rigid, long and wide, with one central vein, rarely two additional veins can be seen. The margin of the leaf is &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20leaf%20morphology%23revolute\"&gt;curled downwards&lt;/a&gt;, densely roughly hairy on upper side, while the lower surface may lose some of its hairs over time, and is gray-green in colour.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Asteraceae%23Floral%20heads\"&gt;flower heads&lt;/a&gt; are about across and sit individually on top of about 15\u00a0cm (rarely to 20\u00a0cm) long, dense velvety hairy &lt;a href=\"Peduncle%20%28botany%29\"&gt;stalks&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bract%23Involucral%20bracts\"&gt;involucre&lt;/a&gt; is almost in diameter, and consist of two strict rows of bracts of about long, more or less fringed at the tip. The outer bracts are narrowly &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23lanceolate\"&gt;lance-shaped&lt;/a&gt;, and wide, the inner bracts are lance-shaped and about wide, one-ribbed, losing its hair with time. The numerous female &lt;a href=\"Asteraceae%23Floral%20heads\"&gt;ray florets&lt;/a&gt; have a milky white, rarely magenta strap of about long and 3\u00a0mm wide, near the base with a dark purple zone. Many &lt;a href=\"Plant%20reproductive%20morphology%23Terminology\"&gt;bisexual&lt;/a&gt;, disc florets with an orange-yellow &lt;a href=\"Petal%23Corolla%29\"&gt;corolla&lt;/a&gt; of about long. In the center of each corolla are five &lt;a href=\"Stamen%23Morphology%20and%20terminology\"&gt;anthers&lt;/a&gt; merged into a tube, through which the &lt;a href=\"Stigma%20%28botany%29%23Style\"&gt;style&lt;/a&gt; grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the &lt;a href=\"pollen\"&gt;pollen&lt;/a&gt; on its shaft. Around the base of the corolla are many white &lt;a href=\"Pappus%20%28botany%29\"&gt;pappus bristles&lt;/a&gt; of about long. The dark brown, dry, one-seeded, &lt;a href=\"Dehiscence%20%28botany%29\"&gt;indehiscent&lt;/a&gt; fruits called &lt;a href=\"Asteraceae%23Fruits%20and%20seeds\"&gt;cypselae&lt;/a&gt; are ellips- to inverted egg-shaped, about long and wide, with a marginal ridge, while the surface has some weak scales and is evenly covered in long hairs.\n\"Felicia elongata\" is a &lt;a href=\"Ploidy%23Diploid\"&gt;diploid&lt;/a&gt; having eight sets of homologue chromosomes (2n=16).\nTaxonomy.\nThe Saldanha felicia was first described by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Thunberg\"&gt;Carl Thunberg&lt;/a&gt; in the year 1800, in the second volume of his book \"Prodromus Plantarum Capensium\", based on a specimen he collected himself in 1772 during his three-year stay in the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Colony\"&gt;Cape Colony&lt;/a&gt;, and he named it \"Aster elongatus\". In 1833, &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Gottfried%20Daniel%20Nees%20von%20Esenbeck\"&gt;Nees von Esenbeck&lt;/a&gt; thought that its should be moved to another genus and he made the combination \"Agathaea elongata\". \"Aster elongatus\" &lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28botany%29\"&gt;var.&lt;/a&gt; \"thunbergii\" was distinguished by &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Harvey\"&gt;William Henry Harvey&lt;/a&gt; in 1865. &lt;a href=\"Karl%20August%20Otto%20Hoffmann\"&gt;Karl August Otto Hoffmann&lt;/a&gt; reassigned Thunberg's species and made the combination \"Felicia namaquana\" in 1905. &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Bolus\"&gt;Harry Bolus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Hurt%20Wolley-Dod\"&gt;Anthony Hurt Wolley-Dod&lt;/a&gt; were not aware of Hoffmann's combination and claimed it for themselves in 1950. In 1973 &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BCrke%20Grau\"&gt;J\u00fcrke Grau&lt;/a&gt; considered all of these name &lt;a href=\"Synonymy%20%28taxonomy%29\"&gt;synonymous&lt;/a&gt;. The species is considered to be part of the &lt;a href=\"Section%20%28botany%29\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Felicia%20%28plant%29%23Neodetris\"&gt;Neodetris&lt;/a&gt;. \"Aster elongatus\" var. \"candollei\" described by &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20Harvey\"&gt;William Henry Harvey&lt;/a&gt; in 1865 however, has now been assigned to \"&lt;a href=\"Felicia%20namaquana\"&gt;Felicia namaquana&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDistribution, habitat and ecology.\nThe Saldanha felica can only be found growing on limestone ridges and coastal sands, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Langebaan\"&gt;Langebaan&lt;/a&gt; Lagoon, and edging the Vredenburg Peninsula to &lt;a href=\"Paternoster%2C%20Western%20Cape\"&gt;Paternoster&lt;/a&gt; in the north. The flower heads appear to be mainly pollinated by bees. Within one month of opening, the flower heads develop into seedheads. It may grow in the vicinity of the Cape daisy, \"&lt;a href=\"Dimorphotheca%20pluvialis\"&gt;Dimorphotheca pluvialis&lt;/a&gt;\", blue flax, \"&lt;a href=\"Heliophila%20coronopifolia\"&gt;Heliophila coronopifolia&lt;/a&gt;\" or in the shade of rooi malva, \"&lt;a href=\"Pelargonium%20fulgidum\"&gt;Pelargonium fulgidum&lt;/a&gt;\" or dikbeen malva, \"&lt;a href=\"Pelargonium%20gibbosum\"&gt;P. gibbosum&lt;/a&gt;\". After flowering and setting seed, the plants die back and survive the long hot summer as short, leafless woody stumps. These start growing as soon as the winter rains arrive. It occurs in vegetation types called Langebaan Dune Strandveld, Saldanha Flats Strandveld, Saldanha Granite Strandveld and Saldanha Limestone Strandveld.\nConservation.\n\"Felicia elongata\" is considered a &lt;a href=\"vulnerable%20species\"&gt;vulnerable species&lt;/a&gt;, because the total population comprises less than 2000 mature individuals, divided over eight subpopulations, and is in decline due to recreational developments.\nUse.\n\"Felicia elongata\" is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental and is can be grown quite easily. It grows very well in well-draining garden soil."
