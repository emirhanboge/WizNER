    "title": "Riau",
    "text": "Riau is a &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;province of Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the central eastern coast of &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Strait of Malacca&lt;/a&gt;. Until 2004 the province included the offshore &lt;a href=\"Riau%20Islands\"&gt;Riau Islands&lt;/a&gt;, a large group of small islands (of which the principal islands are &lt;a href=\"Batam\"&gt;Batam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bintan%20Island\"&gt;Bintan&lt;/a&gt;) located east of Sumatra Island and south of Singapore, before these islands were split off as a province in July 2004. The provincial capital and the largest city of Riau is &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt;. The province shares land borders with &lt;a href=\"North%20Sumatra\"&gt;North Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest, &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; to the west, and &lt;a href=\"Jambi\"&gt;Jambi&lt;/a&gt; to the south. The total area for Riau province is , which stretches from the slopes of the Bukit Barisan to the Strait of Malacca. Riau has a wet tropical climate with average rainfall ranging between 2000 and 3000 millimeters per year, and the average rainfall per year is about 160 days. Riau is currently one of the richest provinces in Indonesia and is rich in natural resources, particularly petroleum, natural gas, rubber, &lt;a href=\"palm%20oil\"&gt;palm oil&lt;/a&gt; and fibre plantations. Extensive logging and plantation development in has led to a massive decline in forest cover Riau, and associated fires have contributed to &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asian%20haze\"&gt;haze across the larger region&lt;/a&gt;. \nRiau is considered part of the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20world\"&gt;Malay world&lt;/a&gt;. It is currently considered as the cultural center of the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20Indonesian\"&gt;Malays in Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, Riau is considered a very diverse province, as it is inhabited by many ethnic groups, such as Malay, Minangkabau, Chinese and Batak. The local Riau dialect of &lt;a href=\"Malay%20language\"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt; is considered as the \"lingua franca\" in the province, but &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20language\"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt;, the standardized form of Malay is used as the official language and also as the second language of many people. Other than that, different languages such as &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20language\"&gt;Minangkabau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hokkien\"&gt;Hokkien&lt;/a&gt; and varieties of &lt;a href=\"Batak%20languages\"&gt;Batak languages&lt;/a&gt; are also spoken.\nRiau allegedly has been inhabited since the period between 40,000 and 10,000 BC. Between 5th to 12th century AD, traders and merchants from the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20subcontinent\"&gt;Indian subcontinent&lt;/a&gt; visited the region to trade with the local people, spreading &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; in the process. Therefore, Riau was under the control of several Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms such as the &lt;a href=\"Melayu%20Kingdom\"&gt;Melayu Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Srivijaya%20Empire\"&gt;Srivijaya Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In the 14th century, &lt;a href=\"Muslims\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; traders from India and the Arabian Peninsula visited the region, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Spread%20of%20Islam%20in%20Indonesia\"&gt;spread of Islam&lt;/a&gt; in the region. By the end of the 14th century, Hindu and Buddhist influence are waning, while Islam influence are growing, leading to the dissolution of many Hindu-Buddhist Kingdoms in Riau. Those kingdoms who still existed transformed itself into an Islamic &lt;a href=\"Sultanates\"&gt;Sultanates&lt;/a&gt;. By the 16th century, there are three great Malay sultanates in the region, namely the &lt;a href=\"Siak%20Sri%20Indrapura%20Sultanate\"&gt;Siak Sri Indrapura Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;, Indragiri Sultanates and the &lt;a href=\"Johor%20Sultanate\"&gt;Johor Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;, the latter which would split in the 19th century into the modern &lt;a href=\"Johor\"&gt;Johor&lt;/a&gt; Sultanate in the Malay peninsula and the &lt;a href=\"Riau-Lingga%20Sultanate\"&gt;Riau-Lingga Sultanate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Riau%20Archipelago\"&gt;Riau Archipelago&lt;/a&gt;. However, by that time Europeans began frequenting the region. first the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20people\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20people\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; and the British. In 1824, the Dutch and British agreed to divide the sphere of influence in the region, with the Malay peninsula falling under the British and Sumatra falling under the Dutch. Soon afterwards, the power of the sultanates in the region began to wane. The sultanates soon became protectorate of the Dutch and was reduced to nothing but a puppet states of the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20Indies\"&gt;Dutch East Indies&lt;/a&gt;, with the Dutch having the authority to intervene in everyday affairs. This occurred until 1942, when the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; invaded and &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20occupation%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies\"&gt;occupied&lt;/a&gt; Riau during the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20War\"&gt;Pacific theater&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. After three years of occupation which was marked by atrocities and war crimes, the Japanese surrendered in 1945. The Dutch soon returned to assume control of the region, but left in 1949 after the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%E2%80%93Indonesian%20Round%20Table%20Conference\"&gt;Dutch\u2013Indonesian Round Table Conference&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Dutch agreed to transfer sovereignty of the Dutch East Indies to the &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Republic of Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, Riau has been part of the unitary state of Indonesia.\nSince the 1970s, much of Indonesia has experienced a decline in population growth rates. Riau has been a significant exception, with increasing rates every decade since 1970 to a 4.35 percent annual rise for the 1990s; however, this rate slowed significantly during the subsequent decade. The provincial population was 5,538,367 at the 2010 census and 6,494,087 at the 2020 Census.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThere are three possible origins of the word \"riau\" which became the name of this province. First, from the Portuguese word, \"\"&lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Ario\"&gt;rio&lt;/a&gt;\"\" which means river. In 1514, there was a Portuguese military expedition that traced the Siak River, in order to find the location of a kingdom they believed existed in the area, and at the same time to pursue followers of Sultan Mahmud Shah who fled after the fall of the Malacca Sultanate.\nThe second version claims that \"riau\" comes from the word \"riahi\" which means sea water. The word is allegedly derived from the figure of &lt;a href=\"Sinbad\"&gt;Sinbad&lt;/a&gt; al-Bahar in the book of the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights\"&gt;One Thousand and One Nights&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe third version mentions that this word comes from the local people's speech, lifted from the word rioh or boisterous, which means crowded, frenzied working people. Perhaps this name is derived from the naming of local people, the Malays who live in the Bintan area, which is now located in the Riau Islands. The name is likely to have become famous since Raja Kecil moved the Malay kingdom center from Johor to Ulu Riau in 1719. This name was used as one of the four main sultanates that formed the kingdoms of Riau, Lingga, Johor and Pahang. However, as the consequences of the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Dutch%20Treaty%20of%201824\"&gt;Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and United Kingdom, the Johor-Pahang sultanates fell under British influence, while the Riau-Lingga sultanates fell under Dutch influence.\nPrehistoric era.\nRiau is thought to have been inhabited since the time between 40,000 and 10,000 BC. This conclusion was taken after the discovery of tools from the Pleistocene era in the Sengingi River area in &lt;a href=\"Kuantan%20Singingi%20Regency\"&gt;Kuantan Singingi Regency&lt;/a&gt; in August 2009. Stone tools found include: an axle, a drawstring, and shale and core stone axes, which are the basic ingredients of making drawstring tools and shale. The research team also found some wood fossils predicted to be older than the stone tools. It is suspected the ones who used these tools were \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Man\"&gt;Pithecanthropus erectus&lt;/a&gt;\" (reclassified as \"Homo erectus\") as such as those found in &lt;a href=\"Sangiran\"&gt;Sangiran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Central%20Java\"&gt;Central Java&lt;/a&gt;. These tools proved the existence of prehistoric settlement in Riau. Earlier settlement was assumed to be possible in the area since the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Muara%20Takus\"&gt;Muara Takus&lt;/a&gt; Temple in &lt;a href=\"Kampar%20Regency\"&gt;Kampar&lt;/a&gt; in 1860.\nEarly historic era.\nThe Malay kingdoms in Riau were at first based on the &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Srivijaya\"&gt;Srivijaya&lt;/a&gt; Empire. This is evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"Muara%20Takus\"&gt;Muara Takus&lt;/a&gt; Temple which was thought to be the center of the Srivijaya government in Riau. It architecturally resembles those temples that can be found in India. In addition, French historian &lt;a href=\"George%20C%C5%93d%C3%A8s\"&gt;George C\u0153d\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt; also discovered the similarity of the Srivijaya governmental structure and the Malay sultanates of the 15th century. The earliest text that deals with the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20world\"&gt;Malay world&lt;/a&gt; is \"Sulalatus Salatin\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Malay%20Annals\"&gt;Malay Annals&lt;/a&gt;)\" by &lt;a href=\"Tun%20Sri%20Lanang\"&gt;Tun Sri Lanang&lt;/a&gt;, in 1612. According to the annals, &lt;a href=\"Bukit%20Seguntang\"&gt;Bukit Seguntang&lt;/a&gt; in modern-day &lt;a href=\"Palembang\"&gt;Palembang&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Sumatra\"&gt;South Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; is the place where &lt;a href=\"Sang%20Sapurba\"&gt;Sang Sapurba&lt;/a&gt; came to the world and his descendants would scatter throughout the Malay world. His descendants such as Sang Mutiara would become king in &lt;a href=\"Tanjungpura%20Kingdom\"&gt;Tanjungpura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sang%20Nila%20Utama\"&gt;Sang Nila Utama&lt;/a&gt; would become king in &lt;a href=\"Bintan%20Island\"&gt;Bintan&lt;/a&gt; before finally moving to &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapura&lt;/a&gt;. Before the arrival of Islam to the archipelago, many parts of the Riau region were under the Srivijaya Empire between the 7th to the 14th century which was greatly influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist tradition. Islam was introduced to the region when the &lt;a href=\"Maharaja\"&gt;Maharaja&lt;/a&gt; of Srivijaya sent a letter to Caliph &lt;a href=\"Umar%20II\"&gt;Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Umayyad%20Caliphate\"&gt;Umayyad Caliphate&lt;/a&gt; in Egypt containing a request to send a messenger to introduce &lt;a href=\"Sharia\"&gt;Islamic law&lt;/a&gt; to him.\nIslamic sultanates.\nIn the 12th century, the entry of Islam into the archipelago was carried through the &lt;a href=\"Samudera%20Pasai%20Sultanate\"&gt;Samudera Pasai Sultanate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aceh\"&gt;Aceh&lt;/a&gt; which was the first and recognized as the pioneer of the Islamic sultanates in the archipelago of during its heyday. The process of the &lt;a href=\"Spread%20of%20Islam%20in%20Indonesia\"&gt;spread of Islam&lt;/a&gt; occurred through trade, marriage and missionary activities of Muslim clerics. These factors led to the spread of peace and the growth of Islamic influence throughout the Malay world. The strong factor of acceptance of Islam by Malay people is the aspect of human equality, which according to the ideology of society at that time adhered to the &lt;a href=\"caste%20system\"&gt;caste system&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;, where lower class caste people were lower than members of higher castes.\nThe golden age of Islam in the region is when &lt;a href=\"Malacca%20Sultanate\"&gt;Malacca&lt;/a&gt; became an Islamic sultanate. Many elements of Islamic law, including political and administrative sciences are incorporated into Malacca law, especially the \"&lt;a href=\"Undang-Undang%20Melaka\"&gt;Udang-Undang Melaka&lt;/a&gt;\" (Law of Melaka). The ruler of Melaka received the title '&lt;a href=\"Sultan\"&gt;Sultan&lt;/a&gt;' and was responsible for Islam in his kingdom. In the 15th century, Islam spread and developed throughout the Melaka region including the entire &lt;a href=\"Malay%20Peninsula\"&gt;Malay Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riau%20Islands\"&gt;Riau Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bintan%20Island\"&gt;Bintan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lingga%20Regency\"&gt;Lingga&lt;/a&gt; and several areas on the eastern coast of Sumatra, namely &lt;a href=\"Jambi\"&gt;Jambi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bengkalis\"&gt;Bengkalis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siak%20Regency\"&gt;Siak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokan%20River\"&gt;Rokan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20River\"&gt;Indragiri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kampar%20Regency\"&gt;Kampar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kuantan\"&gt;Kuantan&lt;/a&gt;. Malacca is considered a catalyst in the expansion of Islam into other areas such as &lt;a href=\"Palembang\"&gt;Palembang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patani\"&gt;Patani&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"southern%20Thailand\"&gt;southern Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Kalimantan\"&gt;North Kalimantan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brunei\"&gt;Brunei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mindanao\"&gt;Mindanao&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the journals of the Portuguese explorer &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A9%20Pires\"&gt;Tom\u00e9 Pires&lt;/a&gt; between 1513 and 1515, Siak is an area that lies between \"Arcat\" and \"Indragiri\" which he calls a port city under a &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20people\"&gt;Minangkabau&lt;/a&gt; king, then became a Malacca vassal before being conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Empire\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Malacca%20%281641%29\"&gt;fall of Malacca&lt;/a&gt; into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20India%20Company\"&gt;Dutch East India Company&lt;/a&gt; (VOC), the &lt;a href=\"Johor%20Sultanate\"&gt;Johor Sultanate&lt;/a&gt; has claimed Siak as part of its sovereignty territory. This continued until the arrival of Sultan Abdul Jalil Rahmat Shah or \"Raja Kecil\" who later founded the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Siak%20Sri%20Indrapura\"&gt;Siak Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;. In the \"Syair Perang Siak\", it is told that \"Raja Kecil\" was asked to become the ruler of Siak for the consensus of the people in &lt;a href=\"Bengkalis\"&gt;Bengkalis&lt;/a&gt;. This aims to release Siak from the influence of the Johor Sultanate. While according to the \"Hikayat Siak\", \"Raja Kecil\" was also called the true inheritor of the throne of the Sultan of Johor who lost the power struggle. Based on the correspondence of the Sultan Indermasyah with the Dutch Governor-General in Malacca at that time, it was mentioned that Sultan Abdul Jalil was his brother who was sent for business affairs with the VOC. Sultan Abdul Jalil then wrote a letter addressed to the Dutch, calling himself the \"Raja Kecil\" of &lt;a href=\"Pagaruyung%20Kingdom\"&gt;Pagaruyung&lt;/a&gt;, that he would take revenge for the death of the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Sultan of Johor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1718, \"Raja Kecil\" succeeded in conquering the Johor Sultanate, at the same time crowning himself as the Sultan of Johor with the title \"Yang Dipertuan Besar Johor\". But in 1722, a rebellion led by Raja Sulaiman who is the son of the former Sultan &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Jalil%20Shah%20IV\"&gt;Abdul Jalil Shah IV&lt;/a&gt; who also demanded the right to the throne of Johor. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Bugis\"&gt;Bugis&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries, Raja Sulaiman then succeeded in seizing the throne of Johor, and established himself as the ruler of Johor in &lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20Malaysia\"&gt;Peninsular Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, crowning himself as Sultan &lt;a href=\"Sulaiman%20Badrul%20Alam%20Shah%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah of Johor&lt;/a&gt;, while \"Raja Kecil\" moved to &lt;a href=\"Bintan%20Island\"&gt;Bintan&lt;/a&gt; and in 1723 established a new government center on the bank of the &lt;a href=\"Siak%20River\"&gt;Siak River&lt;/a&gt; with the name &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Siak%20Sri%20Indrapura\"&gt;Siak Sri Inderapura&lt;/a&gt;. While the center of the Johor government which had been around the estuary of the &lt;a href=\"Johor%20River\"&gt;Johor River&lt;/a&gt; was abandoned, and became the \"status quo\" of each of the warring rulers. Whereas the claim of \"Raja Kecil\" as the legitimate heir to the throne of Johor, was recognized by the &lt;a href=\"Orang%20Laut\"&gt;Orang Laut&lt;/a&gt; community. The Orang Laut is a Malay sub-group that resides in the &lt;a href=\"Riau%20Islands\"&gt;Riau Islands&lt;/a&gt; region that stretches from east Sumatra to the &lt;a href=\"South%20China%20Sea\"&gt;South China Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and this loyalty continues until the collapse of the Siak Sultanate.\nBy the late 18th century, the Siak Sultanate had become the dominant power on the eastern coast of Sumatra. In 1780, the Siak Sultanate conquered the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Langkat\"&gt;Langkat&lt;/a&gt; area, and made the area its protectorate, including the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Deli\"&gt;Deli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Serdang\"&gt;Serdang&lt;/a&gt; areas. Under the ties of a cooperation agreement with the VOC, in 1784 the Siak Sultanate helped the VOC attack and subdue the &lt;a href=\"Selangor%20Sultanate\"&gt;Selangor Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;. Previously they had collaborated to quell the &lt;a href=\"Raja%20Haji%20Fisabilillah\"&gt;Raja Haji Fisabilillah&lt;/a&gt; rebellion on &lt;a href=\"Penyengat%20Island\"&gt;Penyengat Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Siak Sultanate took advantage of the trade supervision through the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Straits of Melaka&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the ability to control &lt;a href=\"Piracy%20in%20the%20Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt; in the region. The progress of Siak's economy can be seen from the Dutch records which stated that in 1783 there were around 171 merchant ships making a voyage from Siak to Malacca. Siak is a trading triangle between the Netherlands in Malacca and the United Kingdom on &lt;a href=\"Penang\"&gt;Penang&lt;/a&gt;. But on the other hand, the glory of Siak gave jealousy to the descendants of \"Yang Dipertuan Muda\", especially after the loss of their power in the Riau Islands region. The attitude of dislike and hostility towards the Sultan of Siak, seen in the &lt;a href=\"Tuhfat%20al-Nafis\"&gt;Tuhfat al-Nafis&lt;/a&gt;, where in the description of the story they describe the Sultan of Siak as \"a person who is greedy for the wealth of the world\".\nThe dominance of the Siak Sultanate towards the eastern coast of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula was quite significant. They were able to replace the influence of Johor before on the control of the trade route in the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Strait of Malacca&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the Siak Sultanate also emerged as a key holder of the &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20Highlands\"&gt;Minangkabau highland&lt;/a&gt;, through three main rivers, namely &lt;a href=\"Siak%20River\"&gt;Siak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kampar%20River\"&gt;Kampar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20River\"&gt;Kuantan&lt;/a&gt;, which had previously been the key to the glory of &lt;a href=\"Malacca%20Sultanate\"&gt;Malacca&lt;/a&gt;. However, the progress of Siak's economy faded along with the emergence of turmoil in the Minangkabau interior known as the &lt;a href=\"Padri%20War\"&gt;Padri War&lt;/a&gt;.\nColonial rule.\nThe expansion of Dutch colonialization into the eastern part of Sumatra caused the influence of the Siak Sultanate to wane, leading to the independence of the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Deli\"&gt;Deli Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Asahan%20Sultanate\"&gt;Asahan Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Langkat\"&gt;Langkat Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;, and Inderagiri Sultanate. Likewise in &lt;a href=\"Johor\"&gt;Johor&lt;/a&gt;, where a sultan of the descendants of Tumenggung Johor was crowned, and was under British protection in Singapore. While the Dutch restored the position of the \"Yang Dipertuan Muda\" on &lt;a href=\"Penyengat%20Island\"&gt;Penyengat Island&lt;/a&gt;, and later established the &lt;a href=\"Riau-Lingga%20Sultanate\"&gt;Riau-Lingga Sultanate&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lingga%20Island\"&gt;Lingga Island&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; also reduced the territory of Siak, by establishing the Residency of Riouw (&lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;: \"Residentie Riouw\") which was part of the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20Indies\"&gt;Dutch East Indies&lt;/a&gt; government based in &lt;a href=\"Tanjung%20Pinang\"&gt;Tanjung Pinang&lt;/a&gt;.\nBritish control of the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Straits of Melaka&lt;/a&gt;, prompted the Sultan of Siak in 1840 to accept the offer of a new treaty to replace the agreement they had made earlier in 1819. This agreement made the Siak Sultanate area smaller and sandwiched between other small kingdoms which were protected by Britain. Likewise, the Dutch made the sultanate a protectorate of the Dutch East Indies government, after forcing the Sultan of Siak to sign an agreement on 1 February 1858. From the agreement, the sultanate lost its sovereignty, then in every appointment of a new sultan, the sultanate must get approval from the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, under regional supervision, the Dutch established a military post in &lt;a href=\"Bengkalis\"&gt;Bengkalis&lt;/a&gt; and banned the Sultan of Siak from making agreements with foreign parties without the approval of the Dutch East Indies government.\nChanges in the political map over the control of the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Malacca Strait&lt;/a&gt;, then the internal disputes of Siak and competition with Britain and the Netherlands, weakened the influence of the Siak Sultanate's hegemony over the territories it had once conquered. A tug of war between the interests of foreign forces can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Dutch%20Treaties%20of%201870%E2%80%9371\"&gt;Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870\u201371&lt;/a&gt; between the British and the Dutch, made Siak in a dilemmatic position, and also in a weak bargaining position. Then based on the agreement on 26 July 1873, the Dutch East Indies government forced the Sultan of Siak to hand over the &lt;a href=\"Bengkalis\"&gt;Bengkalis&lt;/a&gt; area to the Riouw Residency. But in the midst of this pressure, the Siak Sultanate still remained until Indonesia's independence, even though during the Japanese occupation most of the military power of the Siak Sultanate was no longer significant.\nAt almost the same time, The Indragiri Sultanate also began to be influenced by the Dutch, but eventually only really came under the control of &lt;a href=\"Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies\"&gt;Batavia&lt;/a&gt; in 1938. Dutch control of Siak later became the beginning of the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Aceh%20War\"&gt;Aceh War&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the coast, the Dutch moved quickly to abolish the sultanates that were still not submissive to Batavia. The Dutch appointed a resident in Tanjung Pinang to supervise coastal areas, and the Dutch succeeded in impeaching the Sultan of &lt;a href=\"Riau-Lingga%20Sultanate\"&gt;Riau-Lingga&lt;/a&gt;, Sultan Abdul Rahman Muazzam Syah in February 1911.\nJapanese occupation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20occupation%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies\"&gt;Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies&lt;/a&gt;, Riau was one of the primary strategic targets. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Army\"&gt;Japanese army&lt;/a&gt; occupied &lt;a href=\"Rengat\"&gt;Rengat&lt;/a&gt; on 31 March 1942. All of Riau was quickly subject to Japanese rule. One of the relics of the Japanese occupation is the 220\u00a0km railway line that connects &lt;a href=\"Muaro%20Sijunjung\"&gt;Muaro Sijunjung&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the &lt;a href=\"Sumatra%20Railway\"&gt;Pekanbaru Death Railway&lt;/a&gt; which is now abandoned. Hundreds of thousands of Riau people were forced to work by the Japanese army to complete this project. Japan led the construction of 220\u00a0km of railroad from Pekanbaru to the Malacca Strait using forced labor and prisoners of war. This development was carried out for 15 months through mountains, swamps and fast-flowing rivers. As many as 6,500 Dutch prisoners of war (mostly &lt;a href=\"Indo%20people\"&gt;Indo-Europeans&lt;/a&gt;) and British plus more than 100,000 &lt;a href=\"R%C5%8Dmusha\"&gt;romusha&lt;/a&gt; Indonesians (mostly &lt;a href=\"Javanese%20people\"&gt;Javanese&lt;/a&gt;) were mobilized by the Japanese military. When the project was completed in August 1945, almost one third of European prisoners of war and more than half of Indonesian porters died. The railroad was intended as a medium for transporting coal and soldiers from Pekanbaru to &lt;a href=\"Muaro%20Sijunjung\"&gt;Muaro Sijunjung&lt;/a&gt; on the west of Sumatra. Construction of the railroad was completed on 15 August 1945, when the &lt;a href=\"Surrender%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese surrendered&lt;/a&gt;. This railroad was used only once to transport prisoners of war out of the area. The line was then abandoned.\nIndependence and contemporary era.\nAt the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence\"&gt;Indonesia's independence&lt;/a&gt;, the former Riau Residency area was merged and incorporated in the Sumatra Province based in &lt;a href=\"Bukittinggi\"&gt;Bukittinggi&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the crackdown on &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Government%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;PRRI&lt;/a&gt; sympathizers, Central Sumatra was further divided into three provinces, namely &lt;a href=\"North%20Sumatra\"&gt;North Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, Central Sumatra, and &lt;a href=\"South%20Sumatra\"&gt;South Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, Central Sumatra became the strongest base of the PRRI, this situation caused the central government to develop a strategy to break Central Sumatra in order to weaken the PRRI movement. Subsequently, in 1957, based on Emergency Law Number 19 of 1957, Central Sumatra was divided into three provinces, namely Riau, &lt;a href=\"Jambi\"&gt;Jambi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. Then what became the newly formed Riau province is the former Siak Sri Sultanate area of Inderapura and Riau Residency as well as the Kampar which was previously occupied during the occupation of the Japanese army in the \"Rhio Shu\" area.\nRiau had become one of the areas influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Government%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1950s. The central government held Operation Tegas under the leadership of Kaharuddin Nasution, who later became governor of the province, and succeeded in quelling the remnants of PRRI sympathizers.\nAfter the security situation gradually recovered, the central government began to consider moving the provincial capital from &lt;a href=\"Tanjung%20Pinang\"&gt;Tanjung Pinang&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt;, which is geographically located in the middle part of the province. The government finally established Pekanbaru as the new provincial capital on 20 January 1959 through Kepmendagri No. December 52 / I / 44\u201325.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Transition%20to%20the%20New%20Order\"&gt;fall of the Old Order&lt;/a&gt;, Riau became one of the pillars of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Order%20%28Indonesia%29\"&gt;New Order&lt;/a&gt;'s economic development which was stretched back. In 1944, NPPM geologist Richard H. Hopper and Toru Oki and their team discovered the largest oil well in Southeast Asia, namely in Minas, &lt;a href=\"Siak%20Regency\"&gt;Siak&lt;/a&gt;. This well was originally named Minas No. 1. Minas is famous for its Sumatra Light Crude (SLC) oil which is good and has low sulfur content. In the early 1950s, new oil wells were found in Minas, Duri, Bengkalis, Pantaicermin, and Petapahan. Petroleum exploitation in Riau began in the Siak Block in September 1963, with the signing of a work contract with PT California Texas Indonesia (now Chevron Pacific Indonesia). This province had been relied upon as a contributor to 70 percent of Indonesia's oil production in the 1970s.\nRiau was also the main destination for the &lt;a href=\"transmigration%20program\"&gt;transmigration program&lt;/a&gt; launched by the Suharto administration. Many families from Java have moved to newly opened oil palm plantations in Riau, thus forming a separate community which is now quite significant.\nIn 1999, Saleh Djasit was elected as the second native Riaunese (besides Arifin Achmad) and first elected by the Provincial House of Representatives as governor. In 2003, former Regent of &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20Hilir%20Regency\"&gt;Indragiri Hilir&lt;/a&gt;, Rusli Zainal, was elected governor, and was re-elected through direct elections by the people in 2008. Starting on 19 February 2014, Riau Province was officially led by the governor, Annas Maamun. Just leading 7 months, Annas Maamun was deposed after the &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Eradication%20Commission\"&gt;Corruption Eradication Commission&lt;/a&gt; (KPK) arrested Annas Maamun's hand in a case of land use change in &lt;a href=\"Kuantan%20Singingi%20Regency\"&gt;Kuantan Singingi Regency&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nGeographically, Riau which has thousands of cities in Pekanbaru is located at position 02 \u00b0 25 'LU-01 \u00b0 15 \u00b0 LS and 100 \u00b0 03'-104 \u00b0 00' BT. The area is quite extensive and is located in the central part of &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. Riau is directly adjacent to &lt;a href=\"North%20Sumatra\"&gt;North Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Straits of Malacca&lt;/a&gt; in the north, &lt;a href=\"Jambi\"&gt;Jambi&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; to the west and the &lt;a href=\"Riau%20Islands\"&gt;Riau Islands&lt;/a&gt; in the east. The province shares maritime borders with Singapore and &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn general, the geography of Riau consists of mountains, lowlands, and islands. The mountain area lies in the western part, namely the &lt;a href=\"Barisan%20Mountains\"&gt;Bukit Barisan&lt;/a&gt; Mountains, near the border of West Sumatra. The elevation decreases towards the east, making most of the central and eastern part of the province covered with lowlands. Off the eastern coast lies the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Strait of Malacca&lt;/a&gt; where several island lies.\nClimate.\nIn general, Riau Province has a wet tropical climate that is influenced by two seasons, namely the rainy and dry seasons. The average rainfall received by Riau Province is between 2,000 \u2013 3,000\u00a0mm / year with an average annual rainfall of 160 days. The areas that received the most rain were &lt;a href=\"Rokan%20Hulu%20Regency\"&gt;Rokan Hulu Regency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt; City. Meanwhile, the area that received the least rainfall was &lt;a href=\"Siak%20Regency\"&gt;Siak Regency&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe average air temperature of Riau is 25.9\u00a0\u00b0C with maximum temperatures reaching 34.4\u00a0\u00b0C and minimum temperatures reach 20.1\u00a0\u00b0C. The highest temperature occurs in urban areas on the coast. On the contrary, the lowest temperature covers the high mountains and mountains. Air humidity can reach an average of 75%. Slightly different for the island region in the eastern region is also influenced by the characteristics of the sea climate.As in most other province of Indonesia, Riau has a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20rainforest%20climate\"&gt;tropical rainforest climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; \"Af\") bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall.\nEcology.\nForest cover in Riau has declined from 78% in 1982 to only 33% in 2005. This has been further reduced an average of 160,000 hectares on average per year, leaving 22%, or 2.45\u00a0million hectares left as of 2009. Fires associated with deforestation have contributed to serious haze over the province and cities to the East, such as Singapore and &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Lumpur\"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;\nGiam Siak Kecil \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Bukit%20Batu%20Biosphere%20Reserve\"&gt;Bukit Batu Biosphere Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, Indonesia, is a peatland area in Sumatra featuring sustainable timber production and two wildlife reserves, which are home to the &lt;a href=\"Sumatran%20tiger\"&gt;Sumatran tiger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sumatran%20elephant\"&gt;Sumatran elephant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malayan%20tapir\"&gt;Malayan tapir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malayan%20sun%20bear\"&gt;Malayan sun bear&lt;/a&gt;. Research activities in the biosphere include the monitoring of flagship species and in-depth study on peatland ecology. Initial studies indicate a real potential for sustainable economic development using native flora and fauna for the economic benefit of local inhabitants.\nCagar Biosfer Giam Siak Kecil Bukit Batu (CB-GSK-BB) is one of seven Biosphere Reserves in Indonesia. They are located in two areas of Riau Province, &lt;a href=\"Bengkalis\"&gt;Bengkalis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Siak%20Regency\"&gt;Siak&lt;/a&gt;. CB-GSK-BB is a trial presented by Riau at the 21st Session of the International Coordinating Council of Man and the Biosphere (UNESCO) in &lt;a href=\"Jeju%20City\"&gt;Jeju&lt;/a&gt;, South Korea, on 26 May 2009. CB-GSK-BB is one of 22 proposed locations in 17 countries accepted as reserves for the year. A Biosphere Reserve is the only internationally recognised concept of environmental conservation and cultivation. Thus the supervision and development of CB-GSK-BB is a worldwide concern at a regional level.\nCB-GSK-BB is a unique type of Peat Swamp Forest in the &lt;a href=\"Kampar%20Peninsula\"&gt;Kampar Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; Peat Forest (with a small area of swamp). Another peculiarity is that the CB-GSK-BB was initiated by private parties in co-operation with the government through BBKSDA (The Center for the Conservation of Natural Resources), including the notorious conglomerate involved in forest destruction, &lt;a href=\"Sinar%20Mas%20Group\"&gt;Sinar Mas Group&lt;/a&gt;, owning the largest paper and pulp company in Indonesia.\nGovernment.\nThe Province of Riau is led by a governor who is elected directly with his representative for a 5-year term. In addition to being a regional government, the Governor also acts as a representative or extension of the central government in the province, whose authority is regulated in Law No. 32 of 2004 and Government Regulation number 19 of 2010.\nWhile the relationship between the provincial government and the regency and city governments is not a sub-ordinate, each of these regional governments governs and manages government affairs according to the principle of autonomy and co-administration.\nAdministrative divisions.\nRiau Province is subdivided into ten &lt;a href=\"Regency%20%28Indonesia%29\"&gt;regencies&lt;/a&gt; (\"kabupaten\") and two autonomous &lt;a href=\"Cities%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; (\"kota\"), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 and 2020 Censuses.\nDemographics.\nThe total population of Riau spread in 12 regencies/cities as of June 2016 reached 5,921,987 people consisting of 3,053,043 male inhabitants and 2,868,944 female inhabitants. Based from the population per regency/city, the largest population was in &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt; City with 441,554 male population and 428,477 female, while the smallest population was in the &lt;a href=\"Kepulauan%20Meranti%20Regency\"&gt;Kepulauan Meranti Regency&lt;/a&gt; where 106,269 people were male and 98,700 were female. When viewed from the two regencies/cities which have the largest and smallest population in Riau Province, the comparison of many male population is more dominant than the female population.\nEthnic groups.\nRiau is considered a very ethnically diverse province. As of 2015, the ethnic groups in Riau consist of &lt;a href=\"Malay%20Indonesian\"&gt;Malays&lt;/a&gt; (37.74%), &lt;a href=\"Javanese%20people\"&gt;Javanese&lt;/a&gt; (25.05%), &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20people\"&gt;Minangkabau&lt;/a&gt; (11.26%), &lt;a href=\"Batak\"&gt;Batak&lt;/a&gt; (7.31%), &lt;a href=\"Banjar%20people\"&gt;Banjar&lt;/a&gt; (3.78%), &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Indonesians\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; (3.72%), and &lt;a href=\"Bugis\"&gt;Bugis&lt;/a&gt; (2.27%). The &lt;a href=\"Malay%20Indonesian\"&gt;Malays&lt;/a&gt; are the largest ethnic group with a composition of 37.74% of the entire population of Riau. They generally come from coastal areas in &lt;a href=\"Rokan%20Hilir%20Regency\"&gt;Rokan Hilir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dumai\"&gt;Dumai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bengkalis\"&gt;Bengkalis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pulau%20Meranti\"&gt;Pulau Meranti&lt;/a&gt;, up to &lt;a href=\"Pelalawan%20Regency\"&gt;Pelalawan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siak%20Regency\"&gt;Siak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20Hulu%20Regency\"&gt;Inderagiri Hulu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20Hilir%20Regency\"&gt;Inderagiri Hilir&lt;/a&gt;. Riau was once the seat of great Malay sultanates, such as the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Siak%20Sri%20Indrapura\"&gt;Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura&lt;/a&gt;, the Pelalawan Sultanate and the Indragiri Sultanate.\nThere is also a sizable population &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20people\"&gt;Minangkabau people&lt;/a&gt; living in Riau, mostly in the areas bordering &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Rokan%20Hulu%20Regency\"&gt;Rokan Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kampar%20Regency\"&gt;Kampar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kuantan%20Singingi%20Regency\"&gt;Kuantan Singingi&lt;/a&gt;, and part of &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20Hulu%20Regency\"&gt;Inderagiri Hulu&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Riau, has a Minangkabau majority, since it was once one of the Minangkabau \"rantau\" (migration) area. Many Minang in Pekanbaru have lived there for generations and has since assimilated into the Malay community. Most Minang in Riau generally work as merchants and live in urban areas such as Pekanbaru, &lt;a href=\"Bangkinang\"&gt;Bangkinang&lt;/a&gt;, Duri, and &lt;a href=\"Dumai\"&gt;Dumai&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are many other ethnic groups migrating from other province of Indonesia, such as the &lt;a href=\"Mandailing%20people\"&gt;Batak Mandailing people&lt;/a&gt; who mostly lives in areas bordering &lt;a href=\"North%20Sumatra\"&gt;North Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Rokan%20Hulu%20Regency\"&gt;Rokan Hulu&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the Mandailing people now identify themselves as &lt;a href=\"Malays%20%28ethnic%20group%29\"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt; rather than as &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20people\"&gt;Minangkabau&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Batak\"&gt;Batak&lt;/a&gt;. In the 19th century, the &lt;a href=\"Banjar%20people\"&gt;Banjarese&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"South%20Kalimantan\"&gt;South Kalimantan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buginese%20people\"&gt;Bugis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"South%20Sulawesi\"&gt;South Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt; also began arriving in Riau to seek better lives. Most of them settled in the &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20Hilir%20Regency\"&gt;Indragiri Hilir&lt;/a&gt; areas, especially around &lt;a href=\"Tembilahan\"&gt;Tembilahan&lt;/a&gt;. The opening of Caltex oil mining company in the 1940s in &lt;a href=\"Rumbai\"&gt;Rumbai&lt;/a&gt;, encouraged people from throughout the country to migrate to Riau.\nThere are sizeable &lt;a href=\"Javanese%20people\"&gt;Javanese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sundanese%20people\"&gt;Sundanese&lt;/a&gt; population in Riau. Javanese forms the second-largest ethnic group in the province, forming 25.05% of the total population. Most of them migrated to Riau due to the &lt;a href=\"transmigration%20program\"&gt;transmigration program&lt;/a&gt; dating from the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20Indies\"&gt;Dutch East Indies&lt;/a&gt; and continued during the &lt;a href=\"New%20Order%20%28Indonesia%29\"&gt;Soeharto administration&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of them lives in transmigration communities spread throughout the region.\nLikewise, the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Indonesians\"&gt;Chinese people&lt;/a&gt; are generally similar to the &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20people\"&gt;Minangkabau&lt;/a&gt; as many of them also work as merchants. Many Riau Chinese lives in the capital &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt;, and many can also found in coastal areas in the east such as &lt;a href=\"Bagansiapiapi\"&gt;Bagansiapiapi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Selat%20Panjang\"&gt;Selatpanjang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rupat\"&gt;Rupat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bengkalis\"&gt;Bengkalis&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the Chinese people in Riau are &lt;a href=\"Hoklo%20people\"&gt;Hoklo people&lt;/a&gt;, whose ancestors migrated from &lt;a href=\"Quanzhou\"&gt;Quanzhou&lt;/a&gt; in modern-day &lt;a href=\"Fujian\"&gt;Fujian&lt;/a&gt; from the early 19th-century to the mid 20th-century. Some of the Riau Chinese has migrated to other parts of Indonesia, such as &lt;a href=\"Medan\"&gt;Medan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jakarta\"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, to seek better life opportunities, while some have also migrated to other countries such as Singapore and &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are also some groups of indigenous people who live in rural areas and riverbanks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Sakai%20people%20%28Indonesia%29\"&gt;Sakai&lt;/a&gt;, Akit, Talang Mamak and &lt;a href=\"Orang%20Laut\"&gt;Orang Laut&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them still leading the &lt;a href=\"nomadic\"&gt;nomadic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hunter-gatherer\"&gt;Hunter-gatherer&lt;/a&gt; lifestyle in the remote interior of Riau, while most settled into major cities and towns in with the rise of industrialisation.\nLanguage.\nThe people of Riau generally uses the local dialect of &lt;a href=\"Malay%20language\"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20language\"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt;, the official language of Indonesia. Malay is commonly used in coastal areas such as &lt;a href=\"Rokan%20Hilir%20Regency\"&gt;Rokan Hilir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bengkalis\"&gt;Bengkalis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dumai\"&gt;Dumai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelalawan%20Regency\"&gt;Pelalawan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siak%20Regency\"&gt;Siak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20Hulu%20Regency\"&gt;Indragiri Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20Hilir%20Regency\"&gt;Indragiri Hilir&lt;/a&gt; and around the islands off the coast of Riau.\nThe dialect of Malay spoken in Riau is considered by linguists to have one of the least complex grammars among the languages of the world, apart from &lt;a href=\"creole%20language\"&gt;creoles&lt;/a&gt;, possessing neither noun declensions, temporal distinctions, subject/object distinctions, nor singular/plural distinction. For example, the phrase \"Ayam makan\" (lit. 'chicken eat') can mean, in context, anything from 'the chicken is eating', to 'I ate some chicken', 'the chicken that is eating' and 'when we were eating chicken'. A possible reason for this is that Riau Malay has been used as a \"&lt;a href=\"lingua%20franca\"&gt;lingua franca&lt;/a&gt;\" for communication between different people in this area during its history, and extensive foreign-language speaker use of this kind tends to simplify the grammar of a language used. The traditional script in Riau is &lt;a href=\"Jawi%20script\"&gt;Jawi&lt;/a&gt; (locally known in Indonesia as \"Arab-Melayu\"), an Arabic-based writing in the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20language\"&gt;Malay language&lt;/a&gt;. It is sometimes supposed that Riau Malay is the basis for the modern national language, &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20language\"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is instead based on &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Malay%20language\"&gt;Classical Malay&lt;/a&gt;, the court language of &lt;a href=\"Riau%20Sultanate\"&gt;Johor-Riau Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;, based primarily from the one used in the &lt;a href=\"Riau%20archipelago\"&gt;Riau archipelago&lt;/a&gt; and the state of &lt;a href=\"Johor\"&gt;Johor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, which is distinct from the local mainland Riau dialect. Non-mainstream varieties in Riau include Orang Sakai, Orang Asli, Orang Akit, and Orang Laut.\nRiau Malay can be divided into two sub-dialects, namely the inland dialect and the coastal dialect. The inland dialect has phonological features that are similar to &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20language\"&gt;Minangkabau&lt;/a&gt;, while coastal dialect has phonological features that are close to Malay in the regions of &lt;a href=\"Selangor\"&gt;Selangor&lt;/a&gt;, Johor and &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Lumpur\"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt; in Malaysia (because other Malaysian regions have very different dialects). In addition to various other characteristics, the two subdialects are marked with words which in &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20language\"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; are words that end with vowels /a/; the inland dialect is pronounced with vowel /o/, while in coastal dialect is pronounced with the weak vowel /e/ . Some examples include: /bila/, /tiga/ and /kata/ in Indonesian (if, three and word in English respectively) will be pronounced in inland dialect as /bilo/, /tigo/ and /kato/ respectively. While in the coastal dialect it will be pronounced as /bile/, /tige/ and /kate/ respectively.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20language\"&gt;Minangkabau language&lt;/a&gt; is widely used the &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20people\"&gt;Minangkabau people&lt;/a&gt; in Riau, especially in the areas bordering &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Kampar%20Regency\"&gt;Kampar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kuantan%20Singingi%20Regency\"&gt;Kuantan Singingi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rokan%20Hulu%20Regency\"&gt;Rokan Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, which are culturally allied to Minang as well as migrants from West Sumatra. It is also currently being the \"lingua franca\" of &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city in addition to Indonesian. The pronunciation of Riau Minangkabau is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Payakumbuh\"&gt;Payakumbuh&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Batusangkar\"&gt;Batusangkar&lt;/a&gt; dialect, even differs from that of other dialects varieties of West Sumatra. Historically, Minangkabau language used in the &lt;a href=\"Pagaruyung\"&gt;Pagaruyung&lt;/a&gt; highlands is now spoken in the lower &lt;a href=\"Siak%20River\"&gt;Siak River&lt;/a&gt; basin following the waves of migration from &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Hokkien\"&gt;Hokkien&lt;/a&gt; is also still widely used among the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Indonesians\"&gt;Chinese community&lt;/a&gt;, especially those living in &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Selat%20Panjang\"&gt;Selatpanjang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bengkalis\"&gt;Bengkalis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bagansiapiapi\"&gt;Bagansiapiapi&lt;/a&gt;. The Hokkien spoken in Riau is known as &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Peninsular%20Malaysian%20Hokkien\"&gt;Riau Hokkien&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href=\"Mutual%20intelligibility\"&gt;mutually intelligible&lt;/a&gt; to the Hokkien spoken by the &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20Chinese\"&gt;Malaysian Chinese&lt;/a&gt; in Johor, southern &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and Singapore. They are both derived from the &lt;a href=\"Quanzhou%20dialect\"&gt;Quanzhou dialect&lt;/a&gt; of Hokkien that originated from the city of &lt;a href=\"Quanzhou\"&gt;Quanzhou&lt;/a&gt; in Fujian. Riau Hokkien is slightly mutually unintelligible with &lt;a href=\"Medan%20Hokkien\"&gt;Medan Hokkien&lt;/a&gt; spoken in &lt;a href=\"Medan\"&gt;Medan&lt;/a&gt; since the latter is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Zhangzhou%20dialect\"&gt;Zhangzhou dialect&lt;/a&gt; of Hokkien that originated from &lt;a href=\"Zhangzhou\"&gt;Zhangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, also in Fujian. Presently, Riau Hokkien has incorporated many words from the local language such as Malay and &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20language\"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Javanese%20language\"&gt;Javanese&lt;/a&gt; is spoken by the &lt;a href=\"Javanese%20people\"&gt;Javanese people&lt;/a&gt; who migrated to the province. While several &lt;a href=\"Batak%20languages\"&gt;varieties of Batak&lt;/a&gt; is spoken by Batak immigrants from &lt;a href=\"North%20Sumatra\"&gt;North Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nBased on the composition of the population of Riau which is full of diversity with different socio-cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds, it is basically an asset for the Riau region itself. The religions embraced by the inhabitants of this province are very diverse, including &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestantism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Confucianism\"&gt;Confucianism&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of 2015, &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; is the dominant religion in the province, forming 86.87% of the total population. &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; is generally adhered by the ethnic &lt;a href=\"Malays%20%28ethnic%20group%29\"&gt;Malays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Javanese%20people\"&gt;Javanese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20people\"&gt;Minangkabau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banjar%20people\"&gt;Banjars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bugis\"&gt;Bugis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sundanese%20people\"&gt;Sundanese&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Batak\"&gt;Batak&lt;/a&gt; sub-group. &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestantism&lt;/a&gt; forms the second-largest religion, forming as many as 9.74%, while Catholics forms as many as 1.02%, Most of the people who adhered to &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestantism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt; are from &lt;a href=\"Batak\"&gt;Batak&lt;/a&gt; ethnic groups (specifically &lt;a href=\"Toba%20Batak%20people\"&gt;Batak Toba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karo%20people%20%28Indonesia%29\"&gt;Karo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Simalungun%20people\"&gt;Simalungun&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Nias%20people\"&gt;Nias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Indonesians\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; and residents from &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Indonesia\"&gt;Eastern Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. Then there is Buddhism which forms around 2.28% of the total population and Confucianism which forms around 0.07% of the total population. Most of the Buddhist and Confucianism are of ethnic Chinese origin. Lastly, about 0.01% of the total population embrace Hinduism, mostly are &lt;a href=\"Balinese%20people\"&gt;Balinese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Indonesians\"&gt;Indonesians of Indian descent&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nAs Riau is the homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Malays%20%28ethnic%20group%29\"&gt;Malays&lt;/a&gt;, the customs and cultures of Riau is mostly based on Malay customs and cultures.\nEvery Malay family lives in their own house, except for new couples who usually prefer to stay at the wife's house until they have their first child. Therefore, their sedentary patterns can be said to be neat. The nuclear family they called genitals generally built a house in the neighborhood where the wife lived. The principle of lineage or kinship is more likely to be parental or bilateral.\nKinship is done with a typical local nicknames. The first child is called \"long\" or \"sulung\", the second child is \"ngah\"/\"ongah,\" below him is called \"cik\", the youngest is called \"cu\"/\"ucu\". Usually the nickname is added by mentioning the physical characteristics of the person, for example, if the person is dark-skinned and is a \"cik\" or a third child, he will be called \"cik itam\". Another example is when the particular person is a first-born and has a short characteristic. he/she will be called \"ngah undah\". But sometimes when greeting people who are unknown or new to them, they can simply greet them with \"abang\", \"akak\", \"dek\", or \"nak\".\nIn the past, Malays also lived in groups according to their ancestral origin, which they called tribes. This group of descendants uses a &lt;a href=\"Patrilineality\"&gt;patrilineal&lt;/a&gt; kinship line. But the Riau Malays who lived on the mainland &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; partially embraced &lt;a href=\"Matrilineality\"&gt;matrilineal&lt;/a&gt; tribalism. There are also those who referthe tribe as a \"hinduk\" or a \"cikal bakal\". Each tribe is led by a leader. If the tribe lives in a village, then the head will be referred to as \"Datuk Penghulu Kampung\" or \"Kepala Kampung\". Each leader is also assisted by several figures such as \"batin\", \"jenang\", \"tua-tua\" dan \"monti\". Religious field leaders in the village are known as .\nTraditional dress.\nIn Malay culture, clothes and textiles are very important and it signify beauty and power. The \"Hikayat-Hikayat Melayu\" mentioned the importance of textile in Malay culture. The history of the Malay woven industry can be traced back to the 13th century when trade routes in the East are rapidly expanding under the role of the &lt;a href=\"Song%20dynasty\"&gt;Song dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The description of locally-made textiles and the development of the embroidery industry in the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20Peninsula\"&gt;Malay Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; is expressed in several Chinese and Indian records. Among the famous Malay textiles that still exist today are \"&lt;a href=\"Songket\"&gt;Songket&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Batik\"&gt;Batik&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe earliest Malay traditional dress was concise, the woman wearing a \"&lt;a href=\"sarong\"&gt;sarong&lt;/a&gt;\" that covered the lower body to the chest while the man dressed in short, sleeveless or shorts, with shorts down to the knee level. However, when trade with the outside world flourishes, the way in which the Malay dress begins to gain external influence and becomes more sophisticated. The 15th-century is the peak of the power of the &lt;a href=\"Malacca%20Sultanate\"&gt;Malacca Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;. As told in the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20Annals\"&gt;Malay Annals&lt;/a&gt;, this is where traditional \"&lt;a href=\"Baju%20Melayu\"&gt;Baju Melayu&lt;/a&gt;\" clothing is created. The strong Islamic influence has transformed the way of dressing the Malays later on features that are matching with Islamic laws. The classic Malay general attire for men consists of shirts, small sacks, \"sarongs\" worn at the waist, and a \"tanjak\" or \"&lt;a href=\"tengkolok\"&gt;tengkolok&lt;/a&gt;\" worn on the head. It is common for a Malay warrior to have a \"&lt;a href=\"Kris\"&gt;keris&lt;/a&gt;\" tucked into the front fold of sarong. The Malay version of the early women's clothing is also more loose and long. However, it was subsequently renewed and popularized by &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Bakar%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Sultan Abu Bakar&lt;/a&gt; of Johor in the late 19th century, into the form of \"&lt;a href=\"Baju%20Kurung\"&gt;Baju Kurung&lt;/a&gt;\" used today.\nHowever, Riau also has some traditional dress that cannot be found in other parts of the Malay world. The Riau traditional dress is not only used for certain occasions. But some of these traditional clothes are functioned as everyday clothes, one of which is daily clothing for children. The children's daily wear used is divided into two types, namely clothes for boys and clothes for girls. For boys' clothes in the customs of the Riau people, they are called \"baju monyet\" (Monkey clothes). This outfit is combined with the type of trousers that are responsible, and complete with a \"&lt;a href=\"Songkok\"&gt;kopiah&lt;/a&gt;\" or rectangular shaped cloth as a head covering. While for everyday clothes for girls is \"&lt;a href=\"Baju%20Kurung\"&gt;Baju Kurung&lt;/a&gt;\" with floral motifs. This outfit is combined with a wide skirt with a \"&lt;a href=\"hijab\"&gt;hijab&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"tudong\"&gt;tudong&lt;/a&gt;\". The daily clothes of Riau people are commonly used for reciting or for studying.\nFor the people of Riau who are adults, they wear distinctive clothing and are also very close to religious and cultural values. For males, they use clothing called \"Baju Kurung Cekak Musang\". Namely, clothes like Muslim clothing are combined with loose trousers. This shirt is used together with \"&lt;a href=\"sarong\"&gt;sarong&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Songkok\"&gt;kopiah&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFor Malay women, they can wear 3 different types of clothing, namely the \"Baju &lt;a href=\"Kebaya\"&gt;Kebaya&lt;/a&gt; Pendek\", \"Baju Kurung Laboh\", and \"Baju Kurung Tulang Belut\". The different clothes are used in conjunction with a shawl cloth that is used as a head covering. In addition, women's clothing can also be combined with a \"&lt;a href=\"hijab\"&gt;hijab&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"tudong\"&gt;tudong&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTraditional house.\nIn traditional Malay societies, the house is an intimate building that can be used as a family dwelling, a place of worship, a heritage site, and a shelter for anyone in need. Therefore, traditional Malay houses are generally large. In addition to the large size, the Malay house is also always in the form of a \"rumah panggung\" or stage house, facing the sunrise. The types of Malay houses include residential houses, offices, place of worship and warehouses. The naming of the houses is tailored to the function of each building. In general, there are five types of Riau Malay traditional houses, namely the and .\nThe \"Balai Salaso Jatuh is\" usually used for consensus decision-making and other activities. It is rarely used for private homes. In accordance with the functions of the \"Balai Salaso Jatuh\", this building has other local names such as \"balai panobatan\", \"balirung sari\", \"balai karapatan\", etc. Presently, the function of this building has been replaced by a house or a mosque. The building has an alignment, and has a lower floor than the middle room. In addition, \"Balai Salaso Jatuh\" is also decorated with various carvings in the form of plants or animals. Each carving in this building has its own designation.\n\"Rumah Melayu Atap Lontik\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Lontiok%20House\"&gt;Lontiok House&lt;/a&gt;\" can usually be found in &lt;a href=\"Kampar%20Regency\"&gt;Kampar Regency&lt;/a&gt;\".\" It is called so because this house has a decoration on the front wall of the house in the form of a boat. When viewed from a distance, this house will look like boat houses that are usually made by the local residents. Besides being referred to as \"lancing\" and \"pancalang\", this traditional house is also called \"lontik\", since this house has a roof paring that is soaring upwards. This house is heavily influenced on the architecture of the &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20people\"&gt;Minangkabau&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Rumah%20Gadang\"&gt;Rumah Gadang&lt;/a&gt;,\" since &lt;a href=\"Kampar%20Regency\"&gt;Kampar Regency&lt;/a&gt; is directly adjacent to the province of &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. A unique feature of this traditional house is that it has five stairsteps. The reason they chose the number five was because this is based on the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Pillars%20of%20Islam\"&gt;Five Pillars of Islam&lt;/a&gt;. The shape of the pillars in this house also varies, there are rectangles, hexagons, heptagon, octagon and triangles. Each type of pole contained in this traditional house has meaning believed by the people of Riau. A rectangular pole can be interpreted as four corners of the wind, just like an octagon, and the hexagon symbolizes the number of pillars of Islam.\n\"Rumah Salaso Jatuh Kembar\" was declared an icon and symbol of the province of Riau. The architecture of this house is similar to the \"Balai Salaso Jatuh\", but this house tends to be used for private homes. \n\"Rumah Melayu Lipat Kajang\" can usually found in the &lt;a href=\"Riau%20Islands\"&gt;Riau Islands&lt;/a&gt; and the coastal part of Riau. It is called \"Lipat Kajang\"because the roof of this house has a shape resembling the shape of a boat. The top of this building is curved upwards and is often referred to \"lipat kejang\" or \"pohon jeramban\" by the locals. This traditional house is rarely or even no longer used by Riau residents. One reason for the loss of this culture is because of the increasing influence of western architecture, and people consider their building forms to be simpler and easier to build.\n\"Rumah Melayu Atap Limas Potong\" is a Malay traditional house that can usually be found in mainland Riau, but rarely in the Riau Islands. This house has a roof that is shaped like a cut pyramid. Like other Riau traditional houses, this house is also included in the \"rumah panggung\" group. The stage of this house has a height of about 1.5 meters above the ground. The size of the house depends on the ability and desires of the owner.\nTraditional dance.\nMost of Riau traditional dances are influenced by Malay cultures, but there are also some dances that are only unique to Riau.\n&lt;a href=\"Mak%20yong\"&gt;\"Mak Yong\"&lt;/a&gt; is a traditional theater art of Malay society that is often performed as a drama in an international forum. In the past, \"mak yong\" was held by villagers in the rice fields which had finished harvesting rice. The \"mak yong\" is performed by a group of professional dancers and musicians who combine\nvarious elements of religious ceremonies, plays, dance, music with vocal or instrumental, and simple texts. The male and female main characters were both performed by female dancers. Other figures that appear in the story are comedians, gods, jinn, courtiers, and animals. \"mak yong\" performance is accompanied by musical instruments such as &lt;a href=\"rebab\"&gt;rebab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kendang\"&gt;gendang&lt;/a&gt;, and tetawak In &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, the \"mak yong\" was developed in &lt;a href=\"Lingga%20Regency\"&gt;Lingga&lt;/a&gt;, which was once the center of the &lt;a href=\"Riau%20Sultanate\"&gt;Johor-Riau Sultanate&lt;/a&gt;. The difference with the \"mak yong\" performed in the &lt;a href=\"Kelantan\"&gt;Kelantan&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Pattani%20Province\"&gt;Pattani&lt;/a&gt; region is that they usually does not use masks, as \"mak yong\" in Riau uses masks for some of the King's female characters, princesses, criminals, demons, and spirits. At the end of the last century, \"mak yong\" not only became a daily show, but also as performance for the sultan.\nThe \"tari &lt;a href=\"zapin\"&gt;zapin&lt;/a&gt;\" is a Malay traditional dance originated from the &lt;a href=\"Siak%20Regency\"&gt;Siak Regency&lt;/a&gt; that is entertaining and are full of religious and educational messages. This \"tari zapin\" has rules and regulations that cannot be changed. \"Tari zapin\" is usually accompanied by traditional Riau musical instruments namely \"&lt;a href=\"Mirwas\"&gt;marwas&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Qanb%C5%ABs\"&gt;gambus&lt;/a&gt;\". This \"tari zapin\" shows footwork quickly following the pounding of punches on a small drum called \"&lt;a href=\"Mirwas\"&gt;marwas&lt;/a&gt;\" . The rhythmic harmony of the instrument is increasingly melodious with stringed instruments. Because of the influence of the Arabs, this dance does indeed feel educative without losing the entertainment side. There is an insert of a religious message in the song lyrics. Usually the dance is told about the daily lives of Malay people. Initially, \"tari zapin\" was only danced by male dancers but along with developments, female dancers were also shown. Sometimes, there are both male and female dancers performing. There is a form of \"tari zapin\" performed in &lt;a href=\"Rupat%20Island\"&gt;Pulau Rupat Utara&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bengkalis\"&gt;Bengkalis&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Zapin%20Api\"&gt;\"tari\" \"zapin api\"&lt;/a&gt;. The identifying characteristic of \"tari\" \"zapin api\" is the incorporation of fire and strong focus on the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20folklore\"&gt;mystical elements&lt;/a&gt;. The dance form was historically dormant and extinct for nearly 40 years before its revival in 2013.\n\"Tarian makan sirih\" is accompanied by distinctive Malay music accompanied by a song titled \"Makan Sirih\". As for the costumes performed by dancers, they usually wore traditional Malay attire, such as pants, clothes, and \"&lt;a href=\"Songkok\"&gt;kopiah&lt;/a&gt;\" for men. Whereas the female dancers wear the clothes that are usually worn by the bride, namely traditional clothes called the \"&lt;a href=\"Baju%20Kurung\"&gt;Baju Kurung&lt;/a&gt; teluk belanga\". At the head, there is a crown equipped with flower-shaped decorations. Meanwhile, the lower part of the dancers' bodies was wrapped in brightly colored \"&lt;a href=\"songket\"&gt;songket&lt;/a&gt;\" cloth. \"Tarian makan sirih\" is performed by both men and women. The dancers are obliged to understand special terms in Malay dance, such as \"igal\" (emphasizing hand and body movements), \"liuk\" (movement of bowing or swinging body), \"lenggang\" (walking while moving hands), \"titi batang\" (walking in a line as if climbing the stem), \"gentam\" (dancing while stomping on the feet), \"cicing\" (dancing while jogging), \"legar\" (dancing while walking around 180 degrees), and so on. During the performance, one of the dancers in the offering dance will bring a box containing &lt;a href=\"betel\"&gt;betel&lt;/a&gt;s. The box would then be opened and the guests who are considered the greatest are given the first opportunity to take it as a form of respect, then followed by other guests. Therefore, many people call this dance as t\"arian makan sirih.\"\nTraditional music.\nThere are several musical instruments in Riau that is used for ceremonial events. \nThe traditional Malay &lt;a href=\"accordion\"&gt;accordion&lt;/a&gt; is almost the same as the accordion founded by &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Friedrich%20Ludwig%20Buschmann\"&gt;Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann&lt;/a&gt; from (Germany). accordion includes a musical instrument that is quite difficult to play even though it looks easy. accordion produces diatonic scales that are very in accordance with the song lyrics in the form of rhymes. The accordion player holds the instrument with both hands, then plays the chord buttons with the fingers of the left hand, while the fingers of the right hand play the melody of the song that is being performed. Usually players who have been trained are very easy to change hands. When played, the accordion is pulled and pushed to adjust the air movement inside the instrument, the movement of the air coming out (to the tongue of the accordion) will produce sound. The sound can be adjusted using the player's fingers.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Qanb%C5%ABs\"&gt;Gambus&lt;/a&gt;\" is a type of traditional Riau musical instrument that is played by picking. Formerly, \"Gambus\" was used for events related to spiritual matters. At this time \"Gambus\" switched functions to be an accompaniment for the \"tari zapin.\" \"Gambus Riau\" is played by individuals as entertainment for fishermen on boats who are looking for fish.\n\"Kompang\" is a type of traditional Riau musical instrument that is quite well known among &lt;a href=\"Malays%20%28ethnic%20group%29\"&gt;Malays&lt;/a&gt;, \"Kompang\" is included in the group of traditional musical instruments which are played by being beaten. In general, \"kompang\" uses materials derived from the skin of livestock. Making \"kompang\" is more similar to making \"&lt;a href=\"dhol\"&gt;dhol&lt;/a&gt;\" or other musical instrument or other leather drum that uses animal skin such as buffalo, cattle, and others. \"Kompang\" a uses female goat ski on the part that is hit, but now uses a cow which is believed to be more elastic. To produce a loud sound, there is a technique to make the paired skin become very tight and not easily separated from the nail (which can be dangerous when played).\n\"&lt;a href=\"Rebana\"&gt;Rebana&lt;/a&gt; ubi\" is a type of &lt;a href=\"Tambourine\"&gt;Tambourine&lt;/a&gt; that is played by being hit by hand. \"Rebana ubi\" is included in the drum group as well as percussion instruments. \"Rebana ubi\" has a larger size than ordinary tambourines because \"Rebana ubi\" has the smallest diameter of 70\u00a0cm and a height of 1 meter. \"Rebana ubi\" can be hung horizontally or left on the floor to be played. In ancient times, \"Rebana ubi\"was believed to be a tool to spread the news such as the wedding ceremony of local residents or the danger that came (such as strong winds). \"Rebana ubi\" is placed in the highlands and beaten with a certain rhythm depending on the information the player wants to convey.\nTraditional weapons.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Klewang\"&gt;Klewang&lt;/a&gt;\" is a traditional weapon from Riau. \"klewang\" is a kind of machete with the tip of an enlarged blade. In the past, \"klewang\" was used by royal soldiers when in war. However, in the present, it is more widely used by farmers in their activities in rice fields or as agricultural tools. Because of this function, \"klewang\" has remained sustainable compared to other types of traditional Riau weapons.\n\"Beladau\" is a skewer type weapon found in the culture of Riau society. This weapon is a sharp dagger on one side. what makes this \"beladau\" different from the dagger in general is that \"beladau\" tends to have curvature at the base of the handle, so the handle is easier to hold and push when used. In accordance with its length of only 24\u00a0cm, this traditional Riau weapon is often used as a means of self-protection from melee attacks.\n\"Pedang jenawi\" is a weapon that was often used by Malay royal warlords when facing their enemies. Its size is quite long, which is about 1 meter making it used in close-range warfare. At a glance, \"pedang jenawi\" looks like a typical Japanese &lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, many historians and cultural experts argue that this weapon originated from ancient Japanese culture which experienced acculturation with Malay culture. Apart from these opinions, what is clear at this time is that \"pedang jenawi\" has been regarded as the identity of the Riau Malay community.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Kris\"&gt;Kris&lt;/a&gt;\" is a heritage weapon that has been used for centuries. Not only in Riau, keris is generally used by nobles in Southeast Asia. \"Kris\" is a symbol of honor and self-defense. This weapon is used to stab at close range. The position of the \"kris\" in history as a symbol of honor is undeniable, that in the kingdom it was clearly seen as a form of self-protection, as well as pride. Even in modern history, the function continues to develop as an object of history, and can also be a determinant of history based on the period of manufacture and the type of material used. Up to now in Riau Malay customs and culture, always cooperating with kris in every dress as a complementary weapon from generation to generation. However, what is different in the form of \"kris\" from adat in &lt;a href=\"Java\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; is, if the use of \"kris\" in Java is tucked in the back of the waist, in Riau and the Malay people, in general, the use of \"kris\" is in front.\nEconomics.\nThe economy of Riau expands faster (8.66% in 2006) than the Indonesian average (6.04% in 2006), and is largely a resource-based economy, including crude oil (600,000 bpd), &lt;a href=\"palm%20oil\"&gt;palm oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hevea%20brasiliensis\"&gt;rubber trees&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"forest%20product\"&gt;forest product&lt;/a&gt;s. Local government income benefits from a greater share of tax revenue (mainly from crude oil) due to the decentralisation law of 2004. The province has natural resources, both riches contained in the bowels of the earth, in the form of oil and gas, as well as gold, as well as forest products and plantations. Along with the implementation of regional autonomy, gradually began to apply the system for results or financial balance between central and local. The new rules provide expressly limits the obligations of investors, resource utilization, and revenue-sharing with the surrounding environment.\nRiau's economy in the first quarter of 2017 grew by 2.82 percent, improving compared to the same period in the previous year which grew 2.74 percent (year-over-year). This growth was supported by growth in almost all businesses, except mining and &lt;a href=\"Excavation%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;excavation&lt;/a&gt; which contracted 6.72 percent. The highest growth occurred in the Corporate Services Business Field at 9.56 percent, followed by the processing Industry of 7.30 percent, and government administration, defense and obligatory social security of 6.97 percent. Riau's economy in the first quarter of 2017 contracted by 4.88 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This contraction was influenced by seasonal factors in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Business Field (\u22125.04 percent). In addition, contractions occur due to a decrease in several business fields, including: Mining and Excavation (\u22123.50 percent); Processing Industry (\u22125.41 percent); Large Trade and Retail, Car and Motorcycle Repair (\u22122.46 percent); and Construction (\u22128.94 percent).\nEnergy and natural resources.\nThe energy and mineral resources sector is one sector that plays a major role in the development of the province. The leading commodities in the energy and mineral resources sector in Riau include electricity and mining.\nElectricity is an important commodity for human life at this time. Without electricity, almost certainly many construction sectors will be paralyzed. Most of the electricity in Riau Province is still supplied by the &lt;a href=\"Perusahaan%20Listrik%20Negara\"&gt;Perusahaan Listrik Negara&lt;/a&gt; (PLN).\nFrom 2013 to 2015, the electricity capacity produced was 114 Kva/Kwh in hydropower, 94.6 Kva/Kwh in diesel power and 131.2 Kva/Kwh in the gas power. The amount of this electricity capacity does not increase or shrink as well as the number of power generating units. Throughout Riau Province there are 1 unit of hydroelectric power plants, 65 units of diesel power plants and 6 units of gas power plants.\nFarming.\nThe agricultural sector is also one of the factors that play a role in the economic development of Riau. The main commodities of agriculture are rice, &lt;a href=\"Maize\"&gt;corn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"soybean\"&gt;soybean&lt;/a&gt;s. In addition, other agricultural products which are commodities of Riau Province are peanuts, &lt;a href=\"green%20bean\"&gt;green bean&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cassava\"&gt;cassava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sweet%20potato\"&gt;sweet potato&lt;/a&gt;es. In 2015, rice production in Riau reached 393,917 tons of milled dry grain. The production was calculated to increase by 2.2 percent compared to production in 2014. The increase in production was influenced by the increase in the harvested area of 107,546 hectares which increased by around 1,509 hectares (1.42%) compared to the previous year. In addition, rice productivity also increased by around 0.26 quintal / hectare or around 0.71%.\nWhile the increase occurred in &lt;a href=\"Maize\"&gt;corn&lt;/a&gt; production, which amounted to 30,870 tons of dry shelled rice, this production increased by around 7.75 percent or 2,219 tons of dry shelled rice. This increase can be affected because of an increase in the area of maize production by 368 hectares (3.1%) compared to the production area in 2014 of 12,057 hectares. The increase also occurred in corn productivity in 2015 amounting to 1.09 quintal / hectare from 2014 or around 4.59%.\n&lt;a href=\"Soybean\"&gt;Soybean&lt;/a&gt; production also decreased in 2015 by 187 tons of &lt;a href=\"Bean\"&gt;dry beans&lt;/a&gt; (8.02%) from &lt;a href=\"soybean\"&gt;soybean&lt;/a&gt; production in 2014. The decrease in production was influenced by the harvested area of 1,516 hectares which decreased by around 514 hectares (25.32%). However, soybean productivity increased by 2.66 quintal / hectare or 23.15% compared to the previous year.\nIn 2015, peanut production was lower than in previous years. This production fell by 8.39 percent compared to 2014 and 16.65 percent compared to 2013. The decline in production was influenced by the declining area of peanut farming compared to 2013 and 2014, each of 18.41 percent and 9.23 percent .\nIn 2015, &lt;a href=\"Mung%20bean\"&gt;green beans&lt;/a&gt; production was lower than in previous years. This production fell by 7.28 percent compared to 2014 and 3.39 percent compared to 2013. The decline in production was influenced by the decline in the area of green beans compared to 2013 and 2014, respectively 1.53 percent and 3.67 percent.\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"cassava\"&gt;cassava&lt;/a&gt; production also experienced a decline in 2015 of 11.89 percent compared to 2014. Actually, cassava production had increased in 2014 by 14.08 percent. This decrease in production was also influenced by the decline in cassava farming area by 11.61 compared to 2014.\nIn the last three years, &lt;a href=\"sweet%20potato\"&gt;sweet potato&lt;/a&gt; production in 2015 was the lowest. This yield fell by 5.36 percent in 2014 and again fell by 18.05 percent. As before, the decline in production was also influenced by the declining area of sweet potato farming by 4.96 percent in 2014 and 18.83 percent in 2015.\nFishing.\nOne of Riau's leading commodities is the fisheries sector. The geographical condition of Riau where 17.40% of the total area is an oceanic area and there are 15 rivers making the fisheries sector well developed. In addition, the vast extent of untapped land is a great potential for inland aquaculture to develop. In addition, the market demand for fishery products has increasingly made the catchment sector not enough so that fish farming activities such as cages, ponds, public fisheries and ponds are well developed.\nRiau fisheries production mostly comes from marine fisheries. In 2015, the data showed that marine fisheries were 106,233.1 tons or decreased 1 percent from the previous year. In addition, the number of fishery households decreased to 14,610 households, an increase of 0.98 percent. In addition, there was also a decline in the number of fishing vessels as many as 123 units.\nThe land fishery product processing industry can be divided into four types, namely floating nets, ponds, public fisheries and ponds. In 2015, fish production from floating nets was 5,378.56 tons or decreased by 82.52 percent. This decrease was caused by a decrease in the number of floating nets as many as 157,638 units. Fish production in public fisheries also decreased by 3.9 percent due to a decrease in the number of households. Fish pond production increased by 5,425.2 tons or 10.8 percent. Temporary data on fish pond production showed a drastic decrease of 82.23 percent even though the number of fish ponds increased by 89.15 hectares compared to 2014.\nStockbreeding.\nAlong with increasing public consumption needs for livestock products, both in terms of consumption of livestock meat and other livestock products, such as milk and eggs, the Riau provincial government through the Agriculture and Livestock Service Office continues to try to meet these needs. In addition to the commitment of Riau province to increase food self-sufficiency in 2020, the number of animal populations continues to be increased to meet consumption needs. This is reflected in the increase in some aspects of livestock in Riau in the last 3 years.\nAgriculture and plantation.\nPlantation growing is rubber and &lt;a href=\"oil%20palm\"&gt;oil palm&lt;/a&gt; plantations, either run by the state or by the people. There is also a citrus and coconut plantations. For oil palm plantation area currently Riau province has a land area of 1:34\u00a0million hectares. In addition there have been about 116 palm oil mills (PKS) which operates with the production of coconut palm oil (CPO) 3.3868\u00a0million tons per year.\nIndustry.\nIn this province there are several international companies engaged in the oil and gas as well as the processing of forest products and oil. In addition there is also a copra and rubber processing industry. Several major companies including Chevron Pacific Indonesia a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, PT. Indah Kiat Pulp &amp; Paper Tbk in Perawang, and PT. Riau Andalan Pulp &amp; Paper in Pangkalan Kerinci Riau provincial mining. Minerals are petroleum, gas, and coal.\nFinance and banking.\nIn the field of banking in the province is growing rapidly, this marked the number of private banks and rural banks, in addition to local government-owned banks such as Bank of Riau Kepri.\nTransportation.\n&lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Syarif%20Kasim%20II%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Sultan Syarif Kasim II International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt; is the largest airport in the province. It serves as the gateway to Pekanbaru and Riau in a whole. The airport serves flights to other major cities in Indonesia such as &lt;a href=\"Jakarta\"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Surabaya\"&gt;Surabaya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bandung\"&gt;Bandung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Medan\"&gt;Medan&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, the airport also serves international flights to cities neighbouring countries such as Singapore, &lt;a href=\"Malacca%20City\"&gt;Malacca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Lumpur\"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt; in Malaysia. Furthermore, the airport also was used for &lt;a href=\"hajj\"&gt;hajj&lt;/a&gt; embarkation to &lt;a href=\"Jeddah\"&gt;Jeddah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Medina\"&gt;Medina&lt;/a&gt; in Saudi Arabia. On 16 July 2012, a Rp 2\u00a0trillion ($212\u00a0million) new terminal has been opened to accommodate 1.5\u00a0million passengers a year. The new terminal spanning 17,000 square meters and a more spacious aircraft apron which can accommodate 10 wide-body aircraft, twice the capacity of the old apron. The new terminal is designed with a mix of Malay and modern architecture. The physical form of the building is inspired from the typical flying fauna form of Riau, Serindit birds. To meet the technical requirements of a world-class airport, the airport runway is extended from 2,200 meters to 2,600 meters and then to 3,000 meters. There are other smaller airports in Riau which mostly serves regional or charter flights, such as &lt;a href=\"Pinang%20Kampai%20Airport\"&gt;Pinang Kampai Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dumai\"&gt;Dumai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tuanku%20Tambusai%20Airport\"&gt;Tuanku Tambusai Airport&lt;/a&gt; in Pasir Pangaraian, &lt;a href=\"Japura%20Airport\"&gt;Japura Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rengat\"&gt;Rengat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sei%20Pakning%20Airport\"&gt;Sei Pakning Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tembilahan\"&gt;Tembilahan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sei%20Pakning%20Airport\"&gt;Sei Pakning Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sungai%20Pakning\"&gt;Sungai Pakning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Syarief%20Haroen%20II%20Airport\"&gt;Sultan Syarief Haroen II Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pangkalan%20Kerinci\"&gt;Pangkalan Kerinci&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Trans-Sumatran%20Highway\"&gt;Trans-Sumatran Highway&lt;/a&gt; runs along the length of the province. Riau serves as a junction of the highway, with &lt;a href=\"North%20Sumatra\"&gt;North Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Jambi\"&gt;Jambi&lt;/a&gt; to the south and &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; to the west. Most of the roads have been paved, but there are some sections that is in poor condition. Road damage was allegedly due to the large number of trucks carrying palm oil crops passing from Riau to &lt;a href=\"North%20Sumatra\"&gt;North Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; or vice versa. As part of the &lt;a href=\"Trans-Sumatra%20Toll%20Road\"&gt;Trans-Sumatra Toll Road&lt;/a&gt; program, the government is currently constructing the 131,48\u00a0km long &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru%E2%80%93Dumai%20Toll%20Road\"&gt;Pekanbaru\u2013Dumai Toll Road&lt;/a&gt;, which would connect &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt;, the provincial capital and the port city of &lt;a href=\"Dumai\"&gt;Dumai&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Strait of Malacca&lt;/a&gt;. The first section between Pekanbaru and Minas is expected to begin operation in December 2019 and the whole toll road is expected to begin operation in 2020. Another toll road connecting Pekanbaru and &lt;a href=\"Padang\"&gt;Padang&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; is also under the planning stage. Construction is expected to start on the Riau side due to land clearing issue on the West Sumatran side. The project would also include the construction of the construction of an 8.95\u00a0km tunnel in the &lt;a href=\"Payakumbuh\"&gt;Payakumbuh&lt;/a&gt; area that will penetrate the &lt;a href=\"Barisan%20Mountains\"&gt;Bukit Barisan Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, which would be the longest tunnel in Indonesia.\nThe Port of Dumai is the largest port in the province. It serves both passengers and cargo. The port serves ferries to &lt;a href=\"Batam\"&gt;Batam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanjung%20Pinang\"&gt;Tanjung Pinang&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Riau%20Islands\"&gt;Riau Islands&lt;/a&gt;, as well as international destinations such as Singapore, Johor and &lt;a href=\"Malacca\"&gt;Malacca&lt;/a&gt; in Malaysia. River transportation is also important in Riau, as the province is crossed by many large rivers.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru%20Railway\"&gt;Pekanbaru Railway&lt;/a&gt; was abandoned at the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, there is currently no active railway line in Riau. However, there has been a proposal of reactivating the Pekanbaru-West Sumatra railway to connect Pekanbaru and &lt;a href=\"Padang\"&gt;Padang&lt;/a&gt; on the western coast of &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, as well as building the Pekanbaru-Duri-&lt;a href=\"Rantau%20Prapat\"&gt;Rantau Prapat&lt;/a&gt; railway which would connect Riau and the existing railway line in &lt;a href=\"North%20Sumatra\"&gt;North Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, as well as building the Pekanbaru-&lt;a href=\"Jambi\"&gt;Jambi&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Betung\"&gt;Betung&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Palembang\"&gt;Palembang&lt;/a&gt; railway which would connect Riau with Jambi and th existing railway line in &lt;a href=\"South%20Sumatra\"&gt;South Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, this railway system would form the Trans-Sumatra Railway.\nTourism.\nThe prime tourist attractions of Riau can be divided into natural environment, as well as the culture and history of the Riau &lt;a href=\"Malays%20%28ethnic%20group%29\"&gt;Malay people&lt;/a&gt;.\nTourist attractions in Riau are diverse, ranging from marine tourism, because of the location of Riau which is directly facing the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Strait of Malacca&lt;/a&gt;. And also natural tourism is equally attractive when compared to other provinces in Sumatra. This province has a long history and is present throughout the province, thus making its historical and cultural tourism diverse and well-known.\nEach of the regencies in Riau has a tourist attraction within.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20Hilir%20Regency\"&gt;Indragiri Hilir Regency&lt;/a&gt; has a long story before the Dutch colonial period. Quite a lot of power shifts while still in the kingdom. Starting from Keritang Kingdom, Kemuning Kingdom, Batin Enam Suku Kingdom to Indragiri Kingdom. besides having an interesting history, Indragiri Hilir Regency also has interesting tourist attractions, and one of them is Solop Beach which is also a mainstay of tourist attractions in Riau. As Indragiri Hilir was once the seat of the Indragiri Sultanate, there are many relics from the sultanate than can be still found throughout the region, such as the Indragiri Kings Cemetery in &lt;a href=\"Rengat\"&gt;Rengat&lt;/a&gt; and traditional houses with typical Malay architecture. Moreover, Indragiri Hilir is also known for its many waterfalls. Similar to Indragiri Hilir, the &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20Hulu%20Regency\"&gt;Indragiri Hulu Regency&lt;/a&gt; is filled of many tourism spots, such as waterfalls and relic of ancient Malay kingdoms. Furthermore, Indragiri Hulu also serves as the gateway to the &lt;a href=\"Bukit%20Tigapuluh%20National%20Park\"&gt;Bukit Tigapuluh National Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe location of &lt;a href=\"Kampar%20Regency\"&gt;Kampar Regency&lt;/a&gt; which is directly adjacent with the province of &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; allows its culture to be greatly influenced by the culture of the &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20people\"&gt;Minangkabau people&lt;/a&gt;. Kampar Regency also has some famous and historical attractions, such as the &lt;a href=\"Muara%20Takus\"&gt;Muara Takus&lt;/a&gt; Buddhist Temple. There are also many spectacular waterfalls spread throughout Kampar. Moreover, there are also tombs of Malay and Minangkabau kings in Kampar. The city of &lt;a href=\"Bangkinang\"&gt;Bangkinang&lt;/a&gt; has many tourist attractions that have nuances of nature, history, religion and culinary that cannot be found in any parts of Indonesia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kepulauan%20Meranti%20Regency\"&gt;Kepulauan Meranti Regency&lt;/a&gt; has a variety of marine tourism destinations. Therefore, making it one of the biggest contributors to tourist attractions in Riau that attract both domestic and international tourists each year. The capital &lt;a href=\"Selat%20Panjang\"&gt;Selat Panjang&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Indonesians\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;-majority population, making it one of the few cities to have this characteristic. This explains why the culture of Selat Panjang as well as the whole of Kepulauan Meranti is highly influenced by both Chinese and Malay culture. Moreover, there are several Chinese temples that can be found in Selat Panjang and the surrounding area, including the &lt;a href=\"Hoo%20Ann%20Kiong%20Temple\"&gt;Hoo Ann Kiong Temple&lt;/a&gt;, which so the oldest Chinese &lt;a href=\"Taoism\"&gt;Taoism&lt;/a&gt; temple in &lt;a href=\"Selat%20Panjang\"&gt;Selat Panjang&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kuantan%20Singingi%20Regency\"&gt;Kuantan Singingi Regency&lt;/a&gt;, commonly known as Kuansing, is a \"rantau\" (migration) area for the &lt;a href=\"Minangkabau%20people\"&gt;Minangkabau people&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, the culture and customs of Kuansing is highly influenced by Minangkabau culture. On the other hand, Kuansing also contains many tourist destinations. Kuansing is known for its cultural festival that usually happens during the &lt;a href=\"Eid%20al-Fitr\"&gt;Eid al-Fitr&lt;/a&gt; and other holidays such as the Baganduang Boat Festival (&lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20language\"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt;: \"Festival Perahu Baganduang\"). The Baganduang Boat Festival was first held as a festival in 1996. These boats are then decorated with flags, coconut leaves, umbrellas, long cloths, pumpkins, photos of the president and vice president, and other objects that have traditional symbols. For example, rice symbolizes agricultural fertility and buffalo horns that symbolize livestock. In the festival, guests were presented with a variety of entertainment, including \"Rarak Calempong\", \"Panjek Pinang\", and \"Potang Tolugh\". The process of making a baganduang boat is usually blessed with a Malay ceremony. Another festival in Kuansing is the &lt;a href=\"Pacu%20Jalur\"&gt;Pacu Jalur&lt;/a&gt; Festival. Pacu Jalur is the largest annual festival for the people of the &lt;a href=\"Kuantan%20Singingi%20Regency\"&gt;Kuantan Singingi Regency&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the capital, Taluk Kuantan, which is along the bank of the &lt;a href=\"Indragiri%20River\"&gt;Kuantan River&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, the festival was held to commemorate the Islamic holidays such as the &lt;a href=\"Mawlid\"&gt;Mawlid&lt;/a&gt;, or the commemoration of the New Year's Eve. But after the &lt;a href=\"Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence\"&gt;Indonesian independence&lt;/a&gt;, Pacu Jalur is now usually held to celebrate the Independence Day of the Republic of Indonesia. Pacu Jalur is a long rowing boat race, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Boat%20Festival\"&gt;Dragon Boat&lt;/a&gt; race in neighboring &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and Singapore, which is a boat or canoe made of wood that can reach 25 to 40 meters in length. In the Taluk Kuantan area, the native people called the longboat used in the festival as \"Jalur\". The boat rower team ranges from 50 to 60 people.\n&lt;a href=\"Pelalawan%20Regency\"&gt;Pelalawan Regency&lt;/a&gt; has a long history, even as the name Pelalawan was taken from the name of the former Pelalawan Kingdom. And the Pelalawan Kingdom was once victorious in 1725 and was very famous with its Sultan Syed Abdurrahman Fachrudin. Apart from its history, Pelalawan also stores quite a lot of tourist attractions besides its history. Remnants of the old Pelalawan Kingdom can still be seen throughout the regency, such as Sayap Pelalawan palace where the former Sultan of Pelalawan reside. Inside the Pelalawan Wing Palace there are many relics, such as keris weapons, spears, and various other relics placed in the palace central room. Another remnants is tomb of the &lt;a href=\"sultan\"&gt;sultan&lt;/a&gt;s of Pelalawan. Most of the tourist who frequented the tomb are usually pilgrims and certain days the tomb is quite crowded with pilgrims. Moreover, Pelalawan serves as the gateway to the &lt;a href=\"Tesso%20Nilo%20National%20Park\"&gt;Tesso Nilo National Park&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rokan%20Hilir%20Regency\"&gt;Rokan Hilir Regency&lt;/a&gt; as one of the regencies in Riau which is directly facing the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Strait of Malacca&lt;/a&gt;, was once the largest fish producer in Indonesia. Since the Dutch colonial era, Rokan Hilir with its capital &lt;a href=\"Bagansiapiapi\"&gt;Bagansiapiapi&lt;/a&gt; has already become more advanced than other region especially in terms of trade. The tourism industry in Rokan Hilir is also quite well known both on a national and international scale. Rokan Hilir is known for its tourist spots and festival such as the Junk burning festival. Known in the local &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Peninsular%20Malaysian%20Hokkien\"&gt;Riau Hokkien&lt;/a&gt; as \"Go Gek Cap Lak\" (Chinese: \u4e94\u6708\u5341\u516d\u65e5; &lt;a href=\"pinyin\"&gt;pinyin&lt;/a&gt;: \"w\u01d4 yu\u00e8 sh\u00edli\u00f9 r\u00ec\"; &lt;a href=\"Hokkien\"&gt;Hokkien&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB\"&gt;POJ&lt;/a&gt;: \"g\u014d\u0358-go\u030deh-cha\u030dp-la\u030dk-ji\u030dt\"), the &lt;a href=\"Junk%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Junk&lt;/a&gt; burning festival is an annual ritual of the community in Bagansiapiapi which has been well known overseas and is included in the Indonesian tourism tourist.

Now this annual event is heavily promoted by the government of Rokan Hilir Regency as a source of tourism. The initial history of the festival was started by Chinese people who lived in Bagansiapiapi to commemorate their ancestors and also as a gesture of gratitude to the God Kie Ong Ya. Other than that, Bagansiapiapi and the surrounding area has many Chinese temples that can be visited.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rokan%20Hulu%20Regency\"&gt;Rokan Hulu Regency&lt;/a&gt; has the nickname \"Negeri Seribu Suluk\". The district is bordered by two provinces, namely &lt;a href=\"North%20Sumatra\"&gt;North Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"West%20Sumatra\"&gt;West Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. It is certain that the acculturation of culture in Rokan Hulu Regency has become more diverse, starting from customs and traditions. Rokan Hulu contains many lakes, waterfalls and caves that is spread throughout the region. One of the historical assets that is still standing firmly in Rokan Hulu, is the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Rokan%20Hulu\"&gt;Palace of Rokan Hulu&lt;/a&gt;. This palace, which is already 200 years old, is a relic of the Nagari Tuo Sultanate. Although there are some parts of the repair but the architecture is still intact and also the carvings on the wood are still clearly visible.\n&lt;a href=\"Siak%20Regency\"&gt;Siak Regency&lt;/a&gt; is the number two richest district in Riau after &lt;a href=\"Bengkalis%20Regency\"&gt;Bengkalis Regency&lt;/a&gt;. The main export of Siak Regency is petroleum which finally can deliver it to become the second richest regency in the province. On the other hand, the regency is currently boosting the tourism sector to attract more visitors. As Siak was once the house of the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Siak%20Sri%20Indrapura\"&gt;Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura&lt;/a&gt;, the regency contains remnants of the sultanate that is still well-preserved, such as the &lt;a href=\"Siak%20Sri%20Indrapura%20Palace\"&gt;Siak Sri Indrapura Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The palace complex has an area of about 32,000 square meters consisting of 4 palaces namely Istana Siak, Istana Lima, Istana Padjang, and Istana Baru. Each of the palace including \"Siak Palace\" itself has an area of 1,000 square meters. The palace contains royal ceremonial objects, such as a gold-plated crown set with diamonds, a golden throne and personal objects of Sultan Syarif Qasyim and his wife, such as the \"Komet\", a multi-centennial musical instrument which is said to have been made only two copies in the world. Presently, the \"komet\" is still functioning and is used to play works by composers such as &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven\"&gt;Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart\"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Strauss\"&gt;Strauss&lt;/a&gt;. Siak is also home to the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Syarif%20Kasim%20II\"&gt;Sultan Syarif Kasim II&lt;/a&gt;, the last Sultan of Siak.\n&lt;a href=\"Dumai\"&gt;Dumai&lt;/a&gt; is a city located in Riau whose location is very strategic especially for international trade because of its location in the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Strait of Malacca&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Dumai is the largest city in Indonesia at this time. Dumai is home to many beaches and mangrove forests.\nThe capital of Riau, &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt;, contains several tourist attractions. The Idrus Tintin Art Building is named after an Indonesian artist named Idrus Tintin. Judging from the architecture of the Idrus Tintin Art Building almost looks like a Malay Royal Palace, even though this building functioned as an art performance venue. Various works by Indonesian artists are displayed in the building. The &lt;a href=\"An-Nur%20Great%20Mosque%20Pekanbaru\"&gt;An-Nur Great Mosque&lt;/a&gt; is the pride of Pekanbaru. An-Nur Great Mosque is one of the grandest mosques in Indonesia. An-Nur Great Mosque was built in 1968 from the side of its architecture which is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Taj%20Mahal\"&gt;Taj Mahal&lt;/a&gt; in India. Therefore, many people Riau called the mosque as the \"Taj Mahal of Riau\". &lt;a href=\"Soeman%20Hs%20Library\"&gt;Soeman H.S Library&lt;/a&gt; is named after &lt;a href=\"Soeman%20Hs\"&gt;Soeman H.S&lt;/a&gt;, a novelist from Riau and his name is immortalized as the name of the library in downtown Pekanbaru. The &lt;a href=\"architectural%20style\"&gt;architectural style&lt;/a&gt; of the building is similar to open books or like a &lt;a href=\"Rehal%20%28book%20rest%29\"&gt;\"rehal\"&lt;/a&gt; (placemats for the &lt;a href=\"Quran\"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt;). This tourist spot in Riau has quite a collection of books, and has even been the largest library in Asia.\nCuisine.\nThe cuisine of Riau is heavily influenced by &lt;a href=\"Malay%20cuisine\"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padang%20cuisine\"&gt;Minangkabau&lt;/a&gt; cuisines, and also slightly influenced by &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20cuisine\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Javanese%20cuisine\"&gt;Javanese cuisine&lt;/a&gt;s. The cuisine in Riau is somewhat similar to the cuisine in the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20Peninsula\"&gt;Malay Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Strait of Malacca&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraditional Malay cuisine in Riau has much in common with other Malay cuisines in other part of the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20world\"&gt;Malay world&lt;/a&gt; and Sumatran cuisine which generally uses spices and &lt;a href=\"coconut%20milk\"&gt;coconut milk&lt;/a&gt; to produce spicy, fatty and thick &lt;a href=\"curry\"&gt;curry&lt;/a&gt;.. Most dishes use basic ingredients of fish, from &lt;a href=\"pangasius\"&gt;pangasius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mystus\"&gt;mystus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anchovy\"&gt;anchovy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20mackerel\"&gt;Spanish mackerel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Manta%20ray\"&gt;rays&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"prawn\"&gt;prawn&lt;/a&gt;s, and often uses &lt;a href=\"Water%20buffalo\"&gt;buffalo&lt;/a&gt; or ox meat. Additional ingredients commonly used are &lt;a href=\"Shrimp%20paste\"&gt;Belacan&lt;/a&gt;. Almost every Malay dish is served with white rice or with \"&lt;a href=\"nasi%20lemak\"&gt;nasi lemak&lt;/a&gt;\" and is usually eaten using hands.\n\"Nasi Lemak\" is a typical Riau food in the form of rice cooked with coconut milk to provide a savory flavor and fragrant aroma. \"Nasi Lemak\" is generally served with side dishes such as eggs, fried anchovy, chili sauce, cucumber slices and other side dishes.
