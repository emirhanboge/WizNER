    "text": "Prague ( ; ; , ; ) is the capital and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20the%20Czech%20Republic\"&gt;largest city&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Largest%20cities%20of%20the%20European%20Union%20by%20population%20within%20city%20limits\"&gt;13th largest city&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and the historical capital of &lt;a href=\"Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemia&lt;/a&gt;. Situated on the &lt;a href=\"Vltava\"&gt;Vltava&lt;/a&gt; river, Prague is home to about 1.3\u00a0million people, while its &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20area\"&gt;metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; is estimated to have a population of 2.7\u00a0million. The city has a &lt;a href=\"temperate%20climate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20climate\"&gt;oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt;, with relatively warm summers and chilly winters. \nPrague is a political, cultural, and economic center of central Europe complete with a rich history. Founded during the &lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20architecture\"&gt;Romanesque&lt;/a&gt; and flourishing by the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Renaissance%20architecture\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Baroque%20architecture\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; eras, Prague was the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Kingdom of Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; and the main residence of several &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;s, most notably of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles IV&lt;/a&gt; (r.\u00a01346\u20131378).\nIt was an important city to the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg Monarchy&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Empire\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The city played major roles in the &lt;a href=\"Bohemian%20Reformation\"&gt;Bohemian&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Protestant Reformation&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt; and in 20th-century history as the capital of &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; between the World Wars and the post-war &lt;a href=\"Communist%20era%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Communist era&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrague is home to a number of well-known cultural attractions, many of which survived the violence and destruction of 20th-century Europe. Main attractions include &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Castle\"&gt;Prague Castle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Bridge\"&gt;Charles Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town%20Square%20%28Prague%29\"&gt;Old Town Square&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20astronomical%20clock\"&gt;Prague astronomical clock&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Josefov\"&gt;Jewish Quarter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pet%C5%99%C3%ADn\"&gt;Pet\u0159\u00edn&lt;/a&gt; hill and &lt;a href=\"Vy%C5%A1ehrad\"&gt;Vy\u0161ehrad&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1992, the extensive historic center of Prague has been included in the &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; list of &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe city has more than ten major museums, along with numerous theaters, galleries, cinemas, and other historical exhibits. An extensive modern public transportation system connects the city. It is home to a wide range of public and private schools, including &lt;a href=\"Charles%20University\"&gt;Charles University&lt;/a&gt; in Prague, the oldest university in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Europe\"&gt;Central Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrague is classified as an \"Alpha-\" &lt;a href=\"global%20city\"&gt;global city&lt;/a&gt; according to &lt;a href=\"GaWC\"&gt;GaWC&lt;/a&gt; studies. In 2019, the city was ranked as 69th most livable city in the world by Mercer. In the same year, the PICSA Index ranked the city as 13th most livable city in the world. Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination and as of 2017, the city receives more than 8.5\u00a0million international visitors annually. In 2017, Prague was listed as the fifth most visited &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an city after &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology and names.\nThe Czech name Praha is derived from an old &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20languages\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt; word, \"pr\u00e1h\", which means \"&lt;a href=\"ford%20%28crossing%29\"&gt;ford&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"rapid\"&gt;rapid&lt;/a&gt;\", referring to the city's origin at a crossing point of the Vltava river. The same etymology is associated with the &lt;a href=\"Praga\"&gt;Praga district&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother view to the origin of name is also related to the Czech word \"pr\u00e1h\" (with the meaning of a &lt;a href=\"Threshold%20%28door%29\"&gt;threshold&lt;/a&gt;) and a legendary etymology connects the name of the city with princess &lt;a href=\"Libu%C5%A1e\"&gt;Libu\u0161e&lt;/a&gt;, prophetess and a wife of mythical founder of the &lt;a href=\"P%C5%99emyslid%20dynasty\"&gt;P\u0159emyslid dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. She is said to have ordered the city \"to be built where a man hews a threshold of his house\". The Czech \"pr\u00e1h\" might thus be understood to refer to rapids or fords in the river, the edge of which could have acted as a means of fording the river\u00a0\u2013 thus providing a \"threshold\" to the castle.\nAnother derivation of the name \"Praha\" is suggested from \"na praz\u011b\", the original term for the &lt;a href=\"shale\"&gt;shale&lt;/a&gt; hillside rock upon which the original castle was built. At that time, the castle was surrounded by forests, covering the nine hills of the future city\u00a0\u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town%2C%20Prague\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt; on the opposite side of the river, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Town\"&gt;Lesser Town&lt;/a&gt; beneath the existing castle, appeared only later.\nThe English spelling of the city's name is borrowed from &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;. In the 19th and early 20th centuries it was pronounced in English to rhyme with \"vague\": it was so pronounced by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Diana%20Cooper\"&gt;Lady Diana Cooper&lt;/a&gt; (born 1892) on &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Island%20Discs\"&gt;Desert Island Discs&lt;/a&gt; in 1969, and it is written to rhyme with \"vague\" in a verse of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Beleaguered_City\"&gt;The Beleaguered City&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow\"&gt;Longfellow&lt;/a&gt; (1839) and also in the limerick &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikisource.org/wiki/There_was_an_Old_Lady_of_Prague\"&gt;There was an Old Lady of Prague&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Lear\"&gt;Edward Lear&lt;/a&gt; (1846). \nPrague is also called the \"\"City of a Hundred &lt;a href=\"Spire\"&gt;Spire&lt;/a&gt;s\"\", based on a count by 19th century mathematician &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Bolzano\"&gt;Bernard Bolzano&lt;/a&gt;; today's count is estimated by the Prague Information Service at 500. Nicknames for Prague have also included: the Golden City, the Mother of Cities and the Heart of Europe.\nHistory.\nDuring the thousand years of its existence, Prague grew from a settlement stretching from &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Castle\"&gt;Prague Castle&lt;/a&gt; in the north to the fort of &lt;a href=\"Vy%C5%A1ehrad\"&gt;Vy\u0161ehrad&lt;/a&gt; in the south, to become the capital of a modern European country.\nEarly history.\nThe region was settled as early as the &lt;a href=\"Paleolithic\"&gt;Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; age. Jewish chronicler &lt;a href=\"David%20Gans\"&gt;David Solomon Ganz&lt;/a&gt;, citing &lt;a href=\"Cyriacus%20Spangenberg\"&gt;Cyriacus Spangenberg&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that the city was founded as Boihaem in c. 1306 BC by an ancient king, Boyya.\nAround the fifth and fourth century BC, a &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; tribe appeared in the area, later establishing settlements including an &lt;a href=\"oppidum\"&gt;oppidum&lt;/a&gt; in Z\u00e1vist, a present-day suburb of Prague, and naming the region of Bohemia, which means \"home of the Boii people\". In the last century BC, the Celts were slowly driven away by &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20peoples\"&gt;Germanic tribes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Marcomanni\"&gt;Marcomanni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quadi\"&gt;Quadi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lombards\"&gt;Lombards&lt;/a&gt; and possibly the &lt;a href=\"Suebi\"&gt;Suebi&lt;/a&gt;), leading some to place the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Marcomanni\"&gt;Marcomanni&lt;/a&gt; king, &lt;a href=\"Maroboduus\"&gt;Maroboduus&lt;/a&gt;, in southern Prague in the suburb now called Z\u00e1vist. Around the area where present-day Prague stands, the 2nd century map drawn by &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy\"&gt;Ptolemaios&lt;/a&gt; mentioned a Germanic city called \"Casurgis\".\nIn the late 5th century AD, during the great &lt;a href=\"Migration%20Period\"&gt;Migration Period&lt;/a&gt; following the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Western Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Germanic tribes living in Bohemia moved westwards and, probably in the 6th century, the &lt;a href=\"West%20Slavs\"&gt;Slavic tribes&lt;/a&gt; (Venedi) settled the Central Bohemian Region. In the following three centuries, the &lt;a href=\"Czechs\"&gt;Czech tribes&lt;/a&gt; built several fortified settlements in the area, most notably in the &lt;a href=\"Divok%C3%A1%20%C5%A0%C3%A1rka\"&gt;\u0160\u00e1rka valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jinonice\"&gt;Butovice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lev%C3%BD%20Hradec\"&gt;Lev\u00fd Hradec&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe construction of what came to be known as &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Castle\"&gt;Prague Castle&lt;/a&gt; began near the end of the 9th century, expanding a fortified settlement that had existed on the site since the year 800. The first masonry under Prague Castle dates from the year 885 at the latest. The other prominent Prague fort, the P\u0159emyslid fort &lt;a href=\"Vy%C5%A1ehrad\"&gt;Vy\u0161ehrad&lt;/a&gt;, was founded in the 10th century, some 70 years later than Prague Castle. Prague Castle is dominated by the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Vitus%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, which began construction in 1344, but wasn't completed until the 20th century.\nThe legendary origins of Prague attribute its foundation to the 8th-century Czech duchess and prophetess &lt;a href=\"Libu%C5%A1e\"&gt;Libu\u0161e&lt;/a&gt; and her husband, &lt;a href=\"P%C5%99emysl%2C%20the%20Ploughman\"&gt;P\u0159emysl&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href=\"P%C5%99emyslid%20dynasty\"&gt;P\u0159emyslid dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. Legend says that Libu\u0161e came out on a rocky cliff high above the Vltava and prophesied: \"I see a great city whose glory will touch the stars.\" She ordered a castle and a town called Praha to be built on the site.\nThe region became the seat of the &lt;a href=\"duke\"&gt;duke&lt;/a&gt;s, and later &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;kings of Bohemia&lt;/a&gt;. Under Duke of Bohemia &lt;a href=\"Boleslaus%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Boleslaus II the Pious&lt;/a&gt; the area became a &lt;a href=\"Diocese\"&gt;bishopric&lt;/a&gt; in 973. Until Prague was elevated to &lt;a href=\"archbishopric\"&gt;archbishopric&lt;/a&gt; in 1344, it was under the jurisdiction of the &lt;a href=\"Archbishopric%20of%20Mainz\"&gt;Archbishopric of Mainz&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrague was an important seat for trading where merchants from across Europe settled, including many Jews, as recalled in 965 by the &lt;a href=\"Al-Andalus\"&gt;Hispano-Jewish&lt;/a&gt; merchant and traveler &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20ben%20Jacob\"&gt;Abraham ben Jacob&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20New%20Synagogue\"&gt;Old New Synagogue&lt;/a&gt; of 1270 still stands in the city. Prague was also once home to an important &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slave market&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the site of the ford in the Vltava river, King &lt;a href=\"Vladislaus%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Vladislaus I&lt;/a&gt; had the first bridge built in 1170, the Judith Bridge (Juditin most), named in honor of his wife &lt;a href=\"Judith%20of%20Thuringia\"&gt;Judith of Thuringia&lt;/a&gt;. This bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1342, but some of the original foundation stones of that bridge remain in the river. It was rebuilt and named the Charles Bridge.\nIn 1257, under King &lt;a href=\"Ottokar%20II%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Ottokar II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mal%C3%A1%20Strana\"&gt;Mal\u00e1 Strana&lt;/a&gt; (\"Lesser Quarter\") was founded in Prague on the site of an older village in what would become the &lt;a href=\"Hrad%C4%8Dany\"&gt;Hrad\u010dany&lt;/a&gt; (Prague Castle) area. This was the district of the German people, who had the right to administer the law autonomously, pursuant to &lt;a href=\"Magdeburg%20rights\"&gt;Magdeburg rights&lt;/a&gt;. The new district was on the bank opposite of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town%20%28Prague%29\"&gt;Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto&lt;/a&gt; (\"Old Town\"), which had &lt;a href=\"borough\"&gt;borough&lt;/a&gt; status and was bordered by a line of walls and fortifications.\nLate Middle Ages.\nPrague flourished during the 14th-century reign (1346\u20131378) of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and the king of &lt;a href=\"Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; of the new &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. As King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, he transformed Prague into an imperial capital and it was at that time by the area the third-largest city in Europe (after Rome and &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;).\nCharles IV ordered the building of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Town%2C%20Prague\"&gt;New Town&lt;/a&gt; (Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto) adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town%20%28Prague%29\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt; and laid out the design himself. The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Mal\u00e1 Strana and castle area. On 9 July 1357 at 5:31\u00a0am, Charles IV personally laid the first foundation stone for the Charles Bridge. The exact time of laying the first foundation stone is known because the &lt;a href=\"palindromic%20number\"&gt;palindromic number&lt;/a&gt; 135797531 was carved into the Old Town bridge tower having been chosen by the royal astrologists and numerologists as the best time for starting the bridge construction. In 1347, he founded &lt;a href=\"Charles%20University\"&gt;Charles University&lt;/a&gt;, which remains the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20oldest%20universities%20in%20continuous%20operation\"&gt;oldest university&lt;/a&gt; in Central Europe.\nHe began construction of the &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"St.%20Vitus%20Cathedral\"&gt;Saint Vitus Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, within the largest of the Prague Castle courtyards, on the site of the Romanesque rotunda there. Prague was elevated to an archbishopric in 1344, the year the cathedral was begun.\nThe city had a &lt;a href=\"mint%20%28coin%29\"&gt;mint&lt;/a&gt; and was a center of trade for German and Italian bankers and merchants. The social order, however, became more turbulent due to the rising power of the &lt;a href=\"Artisan\"&gt;craftsmen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;s (themselves often torn by internal fights), and the increasing number of poor.\nThe Hunger Wall, a substantial fortification wall south of Mal\u00e1 Strana and the Castle area, was built during a famine in the 1360s. The work is reputed to have been ordered by Charles IV as a means of providing employment and food to the workers and their families.\nCharles IV died in 1378. During the reign of his son, King &lt;a href=\"Wenceslaus%2C%20King%20of%20the%20Romans\"&gt;Wenceslaus IV&lt;/a&gt; (1378\u20131419), a period of intense turmoil ensued. During Easter 1389, members of the Prague clergy announced that Jews had desecrated the host (Eucharistic wafer) and the clergy encouraged mobs to pillage, ransack and burn the Jewish quarter. Nearly the entire Jewish population of Prague (3,000 people) was murdered.\n&lt;a href=\"Jan%20Hus\"&gt;Jan Hus&lt;/a&gt;, a theologian and &lt;a href=\"Rector%20%28academia%29\"&gt;rector&lt;/a&gt; at the Charles University, preached in Prague. In 1402, he began giving sermons in the &lt;a href=\"Bethlehem%20Chapel\"&gt;Bethlehem Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by &lt;a href=\"John%20Wycliffe\"&gt;John Wycliffe&lt;/a&gt;, these sermons focused on what were seen as radical reforms of a corrupt Church. Having become too dangerous for the political and religious establishment, Hus was summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Constance\"&gt;Council of Constance&lt;/a&gt;, put on trial for &lt;a href=\"heresy\"&gt;heresy&lt;/a&gt;, and burned at the stake in &lt;a href=\"Constanz\"&gt;Constanz&lt;/a&gt; in 1415.\nFour years later Prague experienced its &lt;a href=\"Defenestrations%20of%20Prague\"&gt;first defenestration&lt;/a&gt;, when the people rebelled under the command of the Prague priest &lt;a href=\"Jan%20%C5%BDelivsk%C3%BD\"&gt;Jan \u017delivsk\u00fd&lt;/a&gt;. Hus' death, coupled with Czech proto-nationalism and &lt;a href=\"proto-Protestantism\"&gt;proto-Protestantism&lt;/a&gt;, had spurred the &lt;a href=\"Hussite%20Wars\"&gt;Hussite Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Peasant rebels, led by the general &lt;a href=\"Jan%20%C5%BDi%C5%BEka\"&gt;Jan \u017di\u017eka&lt;/a&gt;, along with Hussite troops from Prague, defeated Emperor &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Sigismund&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20V%C3%ADtkov%20Hill\"&gt;Battle of V\u00edtkov Hill&lt;/a&gt; in 1420.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Hussite%20Wars\"&gt;Hussite Wars&lt;/a&gt; when the City of Prague was attacked by \"Crusader\" and mercenary forces, the city militia fought bravely under the Prague Banner. This swallow-tailed banner is approximately , with a red field sprinkled with small white fleurs-de-lis, and a silver old Town Coat-of-Arms in the center . The words \"P\u00c1N B\u016eH POMOC NA\u0160E\" (The Lord is our Relief/Help) appeared above the coat-of-arms, with a Hussite chalice centered on the top. Near the swallow-tails is a crescent-shaped golden sun with rays protruding.\nOne of these banners was captured by Swedish troops in &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Prague%20%281648%29\"&gt;Battle of Prague (1648)&lt;/a&gt;, when they captured the western bank of the Vltava river and were repulsed from the eastern bank, they placed it in the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Army%20Museum\"&gt;Royal Military Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;; although this flag still exists, it is in very poor condition. They also took the &lt;a href=\"Codex%20Gigas\"&gt;Codex Gigas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Codex%20Argenteus\"&gt;Codex Argenteus&lt;/a&gt;. The earliest evidence indicates that a gonfalon with a municipal charge painted on it was used for Old Town as early as 1419. Since this city militia flag was in use before 1477 and during the Hussite Wars, it is the oldest still preserved municipal flag of Bohemia.\nIn the following two centuries, Prague strengthened its role as a merchant city. Many noteworthy Gothic buildings were erected and &lt;a href=\"Vladislav%20Hall\"&gt;Vladislav Hall&lt;/a&gt; of the Prague Castle was added.\nHabsburg era.\nIn 1526, the Bohemian estates elected &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Ferdinand I&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Habsburg\"&gt;House of Habsburg&lt;/a&gt;. The fervent Catholicism of its members brought them into conflict in Bohemia, and then in Prague, where Protestant ideas were gaining popularity. These problems were not preeminent under Holy Roman Emperor &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Rudolf II&lt;/a&gt;, elected King of Bohemia in 1576, who chose Prague as his home. He lived in the Prague Castle, where his court welcomed not only astrologers and magicians but also scientists, musicians, and artists. Rudolf was an art lover as well, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers &lt;a href=\"Tycho%20Brahe\"&gt;Tycho Brahe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Kepler\"&gt;Johannes Kepler&lt;/a&gt;, the painter &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Arcimboldo\"&gt;Arcimboldo&lt;/a&gt;, the alchemists &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Kelley\"&gt;Edward Kelley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Dee\"&gt;John Dee&lt;/a&gt;, the poet &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Jane%20Weston\"&gt;Elizabeth Jane Weston&lt;/a&gt;, and others.\nIn 1618, the famous &lt;a href=\"Defenestrations%20of%20Prague\"&gt;second defenestration of Prague&lt;/a&gt; provoked the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt;, a particularly harsh period for Prague and Bohemia. &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Ferdinand II&lt;/a&gt; of Habsburg was deposed, and his place as King of Bohemia taken by &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20V%2C%20Elector%20Palatine\"&gt;Frederick V, Elector Palatine&lt;/a&gt;; however his army was crushed in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20White%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of White Mountain&lt;/a&gt; (1620) not far from the city. Following this in 1621 was an execution of 27 Czech Protestant leaders (involved in the uprising) in Old Town Square and the exiling of many others. Prague was forcibly converted back to &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism\"&gt;Roman Catholicism&lt;/a&gt; followed by the rest of Czech lands. The city suffered subsequently during the war under an attack by &lt;a href=\"Electorate%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Electorate of Saxony&lt;/a&gt; (1631) and during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Prague%20%281648%29\"&gt;Battle of Prague (1648)&lt;/a&gt;. Prague began a steady decline which reduced the population from the 60,000 it had had in the years before the war to 20,000. In the second half of the 17th century, Prague's population began to grow again. &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20the%20Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; had been in Prague since the end of the 10th century and, by 1708, they accounted for about a quarter of Prague's population.\nIn 1689, a great fire devastated Prague, but this spurred a renovation and a rebuilding of the city. In 1713\u201314, a major outbreak of &lt;a href=\"plague%20%28disease%29\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; hit Prague one last time, killing 12,000 to 13,000 people.\nIn 1744, &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20the%20Great\"&gt;Frederick the Great&lt;/a&gt; of Prussia invaded Bohemia. He took Prague after a severe and prolonged siege in the course of which a large part of the town was destroyed. In 1757 the &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;n bombardment destroyed more than one quarter of the city and heavily damaged St. Vitus Cathedral. However a month later, Frederick the Great was defeated and forced to retreat from Bohemia.\nThe economy of Prague continued to improve during the 18th century. The population increased to 80,000 inhabitants by 1771. Many rich merchants and nobles enhanced the city with a host of palaces, churches and gardens full of art and music, creating a &lt;a href=\"Baroque\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; city renowned throughout the world to this day.\nIn 1784, under &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Joseph II&lt;/a&gt;, the four municipalities of Mal\u00e1 Strana, Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto, Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto, and Hrad\u010dany were merged into a single entity. The Jewish district, called &lt;a href=\"Josefov\"&gt;Josefov&lt;/a&gt;, was included only in 1850. The &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt; produced great changes and developments in Prague, as new factories could take advantage of the coal mines and ironworks of the nearby regions. A first suburb, &lt;a href=\"Karl%C3%ADn\"&gt;Karl\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, was created in 1817, and twenty years later the population exceeded 100,000.\n&lt;a href=\"Revolutions%20of%201848\"&gt;The revolutions in Europe in 1848&lt;/a&gt; also touched Prague, but they were fiercely suppressed. In the following years, the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20National%20Revival\"&gt;Czech National Revival&lt;/a&gt; began its rise, until it gained the majority in the town council in 1861. Prague had a German-speaking majority in 1848, but by 1880 the number of German speakers had decreased to 14% (42,000), and by 1910 to 6.7% (37,000), due to a massive increase of the city's overall population caused by the influx of &lt;a href=\"Czechs\"&gt;Czechs&lt;/a&gt; from the rest of Bohemia and &lt;a href=\"Moravia\"&gt;Moravia&lt;/a&gt; and the increasing prestige and importance of the Czech language as part of the Czech National Revival.\n20th century.\nFirst Czechoslovak Republic.\nWorld War I ended with the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Empire\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of Czechoslovakia. Prague was chosen as its capital and Prague Castle as the seat of president &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Garrigue%20Masaryk\"&gt;Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk&lt;/a&gt;. At this time Prague was a true European capital with highly developed industry. By 1930, the population had risen to 850,000.\nSecond World War.\n&lt;a href=\"Hitler\"&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt; ordered the &lt;a href=\"German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29\"&gt;German Army&lt;/a&gt; to enter Prague on 15 March 1939, and from Prague Castle proclaimed &lt;a href=\"Protectorate%20of%20Bohemia%20and%20Moravia\"&gt;Bohemia and Moravia a German protectorate&lt;/a&gt;. For most of its history, Prague had been a multi-ethnic city with important Czech, German and (mostly native German-speaking) Jewish populations. From 1939, when the country was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;, Hitler took over Prague Castle. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, most Jews were &lt;a href=\"Holocaust\"&gt;deported and killed&lt;/a&gt; by the Germans. In 1942, Prague was witness to the assassination of one of the most powerful men in &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Reinhard%20Heydrich\"&gt;Reinhard Heydrich&lt;/a&gt;\u2014during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Anthropoid\"&gt;Operation Anthropoid&lt;/a&gt;, accomplished by Czechoslovak national heroes &lt;a href=\"Jozef%20Gab%C4%8D%C3%ADk\"&gt;Jozef Gab\u010d\u00edk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Kubi%C5%A1\"&gt;Jan Kubi\u0161&lt;/a&gt;. Hitler ordered bloody reprisals.\nIn February 1945, &lt;a href=\"1945%20Bombing%20of%20Prague\"&gt;Prague suffered several bombing raids&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces\"&gt;US Army Air Forces&lt;/a&gt;. 701 people were killed, more than 1,000 people were injured and some buildings, factories and historical landmarks (&lt;a href=\"Emmaus%20Monastery\"&gt;Emmaus Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faust%20House%20%28Prague%29\"&gt;Faust House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vinohrady%20Synagogue\"&gt;Vinohrady Synagogue&lt;/a&gt;) were destroyed. Many historic structures in Prague, however, escaped the destruction of the war and the damage was small compared to the total destruction of many other cities in that time. According to American pilots, it was the result of a navigational mistake. In March, a deliberate raid targeted military factories in Prague, killing about 370 people.\nOn 5 May 1945, two days before Germany capitulated, an &lt;a href=\"Prague%20uprising\"&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt; against Germany occurred. Several thousand Czechs were killed in four days of bloody street fighting, with many atrocities committed by both sides. At daybreak on 9 May, the of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; took the city almost unopposed. The majority (about 50,000 people) of the German population of Prague either fled or were &lt;a href=\"Expulsion%20of%20Germans%20after%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;expelled&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Bene%C5%A1%20decrees\"&gt;Bene\u0161 decrees&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the war.\nCold War.\nPrague was a city in a country under the military, economic, and political control of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Curtain\"&gt;Iron Curtain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"COMECON\"&gt;COMECON&lt;/a&gt;). The world's largest &lt;a href=\"Stalin%20Monument%20%28Prague%29\"&gt;Stalin Monument&lt;/a&gt; was unveiled on &lt;a href=\"Letn%C3%A1\"&gt;Letn\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; hill in 1955 and destroyed in 1962. \nThe 4th Czechoslovak Writers' Congress, held in the city in June 1967, took a strong position against the regime. On 31 October 1967 students demonstrated at &lt;a href=\"Strahov%20%28district%20of%20Prague%29\"&gt;Strahov&lt;/a&gt;. This spurred the new secretary of the &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovak%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Czechoslovak Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Dub%C4%8Dek\"&gt;Alexander Dub\u010dek&lt;/a&gt;, to proclaim a new deal in his city's and country's life, starting the short-lived season of the \"&lt;a href=\"socialism%20with%20a%20human%20face\"&gt;socialism with a human face&lt;/a&gt;\". It was the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Spring\"&gt;Prague Spring&lt;/a&gt;, which aimed at the renovation of political institutions in a democratic way. The other &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt; member countries, except &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;, were led by the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; to repress these reforms through the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;invasion of Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; and the capital, Prague, on 21 August 1968. The invasion, chiefly by infantry and tanks, effectively suppressed any further attempts at reform. The military occupation of Czechoslovakia by the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; would end only in 1991.\n&lt;a href=\"Jan%20Palach\"&gt;Jan Palach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Zaj%C3%ADc\"&gt;Jan Zaj\u00edc&lt;/a&gt; committed suicide by &lt;a href=\"self-immolation\"&gt;self-immolation&lt;/a&gt; in January and February 1969 to protest against the \"&lt;a href=\"Normalization%20%28Czechoslovakia%29\"&gt;normalization&lt;/a&gt;\" of the country.\nAfter the Velvet Revolution.\nIn 1989, after the riot police beat back a peaceful student demonstration, the &lt;a href=\"Velvet%20Revolution\"&gt;Velvet Revolution&lt;/a&gt; crowded the streets of Prague, and the capital of &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; benefited greatly from the new mood. In 1993, after the &lt;a href=\"Velvet%20Divorce\"&gt;Velvet Divorce&lt;/a&gt;, Prague became the capital city of the new Czech Republic. From 1995 high-rise buildings began to be built in Prague in large quantities. In the late 1990s, Prague again became an important cultural center of Europe and was notably influenced by &lt;a href=\"globalisation\"&gt;globalisation&lt;/a&gt;. In 2000, &lt;a href=\"IMF\"&gt;IMF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20Bank\"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; summit took place in Prague and &lt;a href=\"Anti-globalization%20protests%20in%20Prague\"&gt;anti-globalization riots&lt;/a&gt; took place here. In 2002, Prague suffered from &lt;a href=\"2002%20European%20floods\"&gt;widespread floods&lt;/a&gt; that damaged buildings and its underground transport system.\nPrague &lt;a href=\"Prague%20bid%20for%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;launched a bid&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2016 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, but failed to make the candidate city &lt;a href=\"shortlist\"&gt;shortlist&lt;/a&gt;. In June 2009, as the result of financial pressures from the global recession, Prague's officials also chose to cancel the city's planned bid for the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2020 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nPrague is situated on the &lt;a href=\"Vltava\"&gt;Vltava&lt;/a&gt; river, at . in the center of the Bohemian Basin. Prague is approximately at the same latitude as &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, Germany; &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, France; and &lt;a href=\"Vancouver\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, Canada.\nClimate.\nPrague has an &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20climate\"&gt;oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt;: \"Cfb\") with &lt;a href=\"humid%20continental%20climate\"&gt;humid continental&lt;/a&gt; (\"Dfb\") influences, defined as such by the isotherm. The winters are relatively cold with average temperatures at about freezing point, and with very little sunshine. Snow cover can be common between mid-November and late March although snow accumulations of more than are infrequent. There are also a few periods of mild temperatures in winter. Summers usually bring plenty of sunshine and the average high temperature of . Nights can be quite cool even in summer, though. Precipitation in Prague (and most of the Bohemian lowland) is rather low (just over per year) since it is located in the &lt;a href=\"rain%20shadow\"&gt;rain shadow&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sudetes\"&gt;Sudetes&lt;/a&gt; and other mountain ranges. The driest season is usually winter while late spring and summer can bring quite heavy rain, especially in form of thundershowers. &lt;a href=\"Inversion%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;Temperature inversions&lt;/a&gt; are relatively common between mid-October and mid-March bringing foggy, cold days and sometimes moderate air pollution. Prague is also a windy city with common sustained western winds and an average wind speed of that often help break temperature inversions and clear the air in cold months. \nAdministration.\nAdministrative division.\nPrague is the capital of the Czech Republic and as such is the regular seat of its central authorities. Since 24 November 1990, it is de facto again a statutory town, but has a specific status of the municipality and the region at the same time. Prague also houses the administrative institutions of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Bohemian%20Region\"&gt;Central Bohemian Region&lt;/a&gt;.\nUntil 1949, all administrative districts of Prague were formed by the whole one or more cadastral unit, municipality or town. Since 1949, there has been a fundamental change in the administrative division. Since then, the boundaries of many urban districts, administrative districts and city districts are independent of the boundaries of cadastral territories and some cadastral territories are thus divided into administrative and self-governing parts of the city. &lt;a href=\"Cadastre\"&gt;Cadastral area&lt;/a&gt; (for example, &lt;a href=\"Vinohrady\"&gt;Vinohrady&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sm%C3%ADchov\"&gt;Sm\u00edchov&lt;/a&gt;) are still relevant especially for the registration of land and real estate and house numbering.\nPrague is divided into 10 municipal districts (1\u201310), 22 administrative districts (1\u201322), 57 municipal parts, or 112 cadastral areas.\nCity government.\nPrague is autonomously administered by the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20City%20Assembly\"&gt;Prague City Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, which is elected through municipal elections and consists of 55 to 70 members. Executive body of Prague, elected by the Assembly is a &lt;a href=\"Prague%20City%20Council\"&gt;Prague City Council&lt;/a&gt;. The municipal office of Prague is called &lt;a href=\"Prague%20City%20Hall\"&gt;Prague City Hall&lt;/a&gt;. It has 11 members including the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Prague\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; and it prepares proposals for the Assembly meetings and ensures that adopted resolutions are fulfilled. The &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Prague\"&gt;Mayor of Prague&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Pirate%20Party\"&gt;Czech Pirate Party&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Zden%C4%9Bk%20H%C5%99ib\"&gt;Zden\u011bk H\u0159ib&lt;/a&gt;.\nPopulation.\nAccording to the 2011 census, about 14% of the city inhabitants were born outside the Czech Republic. That is the highest proportion in the country. However, in 2011, 64.8 per cent of the city's population self-identified themselves as &lt;a href=\"Czechs\"&gt;Czechs&lt;/a&gt;, which is higher than the national average. Even though official population of Prague hovers around 1.3 million, the real number of people in the city is much higher due to only 65% of its residents being marked as permanently living in the city, these data were taken from mobile phone movements around the city, and bring total population of Prague to about 1.9\u20132 million, and with additional 300,000 to 400,000 people coming to the city for work, education or shopping, on weekdays there are more than 2 million people in the city.\nDevelopment of the Prague population since 1378:\nCulture.\nThe city is traditionally one of the cultural centres of Europe, hosting many cultural events. Some of the significant cultural institutions include the &lt;a href=\"National%20Theatre%20%28Prague%29\"&gt;National Theatre&lt;/a&gt; (\"N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Divadlo\") and the &lt;a href=\"Estates%20Theatre\"&gt;Estates Theatre&lt;/a&gt; (\"Stavovsk\u00e9 or Tylovo\" or \"Nosticovo divadlo\"), where the premi\u00e8res of &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart\"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Giovanni\"&gt;Don Giovanni&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"La%20clemenza%20di%20Tito\"&gt;La clemenza di Tito&lt;/a&gt;\" were held. Other major cultural institutions are the &lt;a href=\"Rudolfinum\"&gt;Rudolfinum&lt;/a&gt; which is home to the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Philharmonic\"&gt;Czech Philharmonic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20House\"&gt;Municipal House&lt;/a&gt; which is home to the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Symphony%20Orchestra\"&gt;Prague Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"State%20Opera%20%28Prague%29\"&gt;Prague State Opera&lt;/a&gt; (St\u00e1tn\u00ed opera) performs at the Smetana Theatre.\nThe city has many world-class museums, including the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20%28Prague%29\"&gt;National Museum&lt;/a&gt; (N\u00e1rodn\u00ed muzeum), the Museum of the Capital City of Prague, the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Museum%20in%20Prague\"&gt;Jewish Museum in Prague&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alfons%20Mucha\"&gt;Alfons Mucha&lt;/a&gt; Museum, the African-Prague Museum, the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Decorative%20Arts%20in%20Prague\"&gt;Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"N%C3%A1prstek%20Museum\"&gt;N\u00e1prstek Museum&lt;/a&gt; (N\u00e1prstkovo Muzeum), the &lt;a href=\"Josef%20Sudek%20Gallery\"&gt;Josef Sudek Gallery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Josef%20Sudek%20Studio\"&gt;The Josef Sudek Studio&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Clementinum\"&gt;National Library&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery%20in%20Prague\"&gt;National Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, which manages the largest collection of art in the Czech Republic.\nThere are hundreds of concert halls, galleries, cinemas and music clubs in the city.

Prague &lt;a href=\"Bombing%20of%20Prague\"&gt;suffered considerably less&lt;/a&gt; damage during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; than some other major cities in the region, allowing most of its historic architecture to stay true to form. It contains one of the world's most pristine and varied collections of architecture, from &lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20art\"&gt;Romanesque&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baroque\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rococo\"&gt;Rococo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Neo-Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Neo-Gothic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Art%20Nouveau\"&gt;Art Nouveau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cubism\"&gt;Cubist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neoclassicism\"&gt;Neo-Classical&lt;/a&gt; and ultra-modern.\nPrague is classified as an \"Alpha-\" &lt;a href=\"global%20city\"&gt;global city&lt;/a&gt; according to &lt;a href=\"GaWC\"&gt;GaWC&lt;/a&gt; studies, comparable to &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; Prague ranked sixth in the &lt;a href=\"Tripadvisor\"&gt;Tripadvisor&lt;/a&gt; world list of best destinations in 2016.
