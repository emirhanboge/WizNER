    "text": "Bielsko (, ) was until 1950 an independent town situated in &lt;a href=\"Cieszyn%20Silesia\"&gt;Cieszyn Silesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;. In 1951 it was joined with &lt;a href=\"Bia%C5%82a%20Krakowska\"&gt;Bia\u0142a Krakowska&lt;/a&gt; to form the new town of &lt;a href=\"Bielsko-Bia%C5%82a\"&gt;Bielsko-Bia\u0142a&lt;/a&gt;. Bielsko constitutes the western part of that town.\nBielsko was founded by the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Cieszyn\"&gt;Cieszyn Piast dukes&lt;/a&gt; in the late 13th century on the grounds of village later called &lt;a href=\"Stare%20Bielsko\"&gt;Stare Bielsko&lt;/a&gt; (\"Old Bielsko\"), on the &lt;a href=\"Bia%C5%82a%20River%20%28Vistula%20basin%29\"&gt;Bia\u0142a River&lt;/a&gt;. It was first mentioned in a written document in 1312. Originally settled by Germans, it became the largest German-language center (\"Deutsche Sprachinsel Bielitz\") in the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Teschen\"&gt;Duchy of Teschen&lt;/a&gt;, and remained so until the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. In 1572 it gained autonomy as the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Bielsko\"&gt;Duchy (State) of Bielsko&lt;/a&gt;. During the 18th century a rapid development of &lt;a href=\"textile\"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt; industry occurred, and at the beginning of the 19th century more than 500 &lt;a href=\"weaving\"&gt;weaver&lt;/a&gt;s worked in the town. After the 1920 division of &lt;a href=\"Cieszyn%20Silesia\"&gt;Cieszyn Silesia&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; it became, despite the protests of local Germans, a part of Poland.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; census of 1910 the town had 18,568 inhabitants. The census asked people for their native language: 15,144 (84.3%) were German-speaking, 2,568 (14.3%) were Polish-speaking and 136 (0.7%) were Czech-speaking. &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; were not allowed to declare &lt;a href=\"Yiddish%20language\"&gt;Yiddish&lt;/a&gt;, and most of them thus declared German as their native language. The most populous religious groups were &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholics\"&gt;Roman Catholics&lt;/a&gt; with 10,378 (55.9%), followed by &lt;a href=\"Protestants\"&gt;Protestants&lt;/a&gt; with 4,955 (26.7%) and the &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; with 3,024 (16.3%). The vast majority of the Jews were exterminated by Nazis during World War II, and the German population was expelled by the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviets&lt;/a&gt; after the war under the terms demanded by Stalin at the &lt;a href=\"Potsdam%20Conference\"&gt;Potsdam Conference&lt;/a&gt;.\nThree well-known &lt;a href=\"Holocaust%20survivors\"&gt;Holocaust survivors&lt;/a&gt; from Bielsko are &lt;a href=\"Kitty%20Hart-Moxon\"&gt;Kitty Hart-Moxon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Frister\"&gt;Roman Frister&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gerda%20Weissmann%20Klein\"&gt;Gerda Weissmann Klein&lt;/a&gt;. All three have written autobiographies and other works about their experiences during the Second World War. The ancestors of the British peer &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Tugendhat%2C%20Baron%20Tugendhat\"&gt;Christopher Tugendhat, Baron Tugendhat&lt;/a&gt;, are also from what was Bielitz."
