    "text": "Jarlsberg ( , ) is a mild &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt; made from &lt;a href=\"Cattle\"&gt;cow's&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, with large, regular &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20%28cheese%29\"&gt;eyes&lt;/a&gt;, originating from &lt;a href=\"Jarlsberg\"&gt;Jarlsberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. It is produced in Norway, as well as in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, licensed from Norwegian &lt;a href=\"dairy\"&gt;dairy&lt;/a&gt; producers. It is classified as a &lt;a href=\"Swiss-type%20cheeses\"&gt;Swiss-type cheese&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nJarlsberg cheese has a yellow wax rind (outer layer) and a semi-firm yellow interior. It is a mild, buttery cheese. The flavour has been described as \"clean and rich, with a slightly sweet and nutty flavour\". It is an all-purpose cheese, used for both cooking and eating as a &lt;a href=\"snack%20food\"&gt;snack&lt;/a&gt;. It has a characteristic smooth, shiny-yellow body, and a creamy, supple texture. It is aged a minimum of three months and is distinguished by medium to large holes. Some variations are aged a minimum of 9, 12 or 15 months. It is usually produced in wheels with an approximate diameter of and a height of . The characteristic holes or \"eyes\" are the result of the action of the bacteria \"&lt;a href=\"Propionibacterium%20freudenreichii\"&gt;Propionibacterium freudenreichii&lt;/a&gt;\" which naturally occurs in milk and is added back into the cheese during production according to a closely guarded secret formula.\nHistory.\nThe history of this cheese can be traced back to the middle 1850s. Anders Larsen Bakke (1815\u20131899), a farmer and pioneer in Norway's dairy industry, produced cheese in the village of &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A5le\"&gt;V\u00e5le&lt;/a&gt; in what was then the county of Jarlsberg and Larviks Amt (now &lt;a href=\"Vestfold\"&gt;Vestfold&lt;/a&gt;), south of &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;. The cheese shares similarities with &lt;a href=\"Emmental%20%28cheese%29\"&gt;Emmental&lt;/a&gt;, introduced to Vestfold by &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; cheese makers during the 1830s. The cheese was first noted in the annual county report of Jarlsberg and Larviks Amt in 1855. After several years of popularity marked by a large volume of production Jarlsberg disappeared from the market.\nModern Jarlsberg cheese was developed in 1956 by &lt;a href=\"Ole%20Martin%20Ystgaard\"&gt;Ole Martin Ystgaard&lt;/a&gt; of the Dairy Institute at the &lt;a href=\"Agricultural%20University%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Agricultural University of Norway&lt;/a&gt;. Ystgaard's interest was sparked by the thesis of a dairy sciences student, Per Sakshaug, on the cheese historically made in Vestfold. It was named for a Norwegian nobleman, &lt;a href=\"Counts%20of%20Wedel-Jarlsberg\"&gt;Count Wedel Jarlsberg&lt;/a&gt;, who owned land near Oslo in an area where an earlier version of the cheese was produced in the early 1800s, or for the eponymous county. The recipe was developed from formulae originating with Swiss cheesemakers who moved to Norway at that time.\nProduction and distribution.\n\"Jarlsberg\" is a &lt;a href=\"trademark\"&gt;trademark&lt;/a&gt; first registered by Tine SA in 1972, and the exact nature and formula for the process of making Jarlsberg cheese is a &lt;a href=\"trade%20secret\"&gt;trade secret&lt;/a&gt;. The largest producer of Jarlsberg cheese is &lt;a href=\"Tine%20SA\"&gt;Tine SA&lt;/a&gt;. Tine is the largest Norwegian dairy product &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt;. Jarlsberg cheese accounts for 80% of Tine's total exports. Tine's United States subsidiary, Norseland, has sold 150 million wheels of Jarlsberg cheese in the U.S. .\nJarlsberg cheese was introduced in the United States in 1964. Imports to the U.S. in 1965 were . Since 1979 imports to the U.S. have been limited to . Jarlsberg is the most popular imported cheese in the U.S. , of Jarlsberg cheese was made in the U.S. in Ohio. It is also produced in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; by Dairygold.\nAnnual sales of Jarlsberg cheese in the United Kingdom are \u00a36.9m . Jarlsberg cheese is also popular in Australia. \nJarlsberg is used as the topping of the &lt;a href=\"Grandiosa\"&gt;Grandiosa&lt;/a&gt;, the best-selling frozen pizza in Norway."
