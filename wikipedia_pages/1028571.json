    "text": "Nelumbo lutea is a species of &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Family%20%28Biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nelumbo\"&gt;Nelumbo&lt;/a&gt;naceae. Common names include American lotus, yellow lotus, water-chinquapin, and vol\u00e9e. It is native to &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;. The botanical name \"Nelumbo lutea\" &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Ludwig%20Willdenow\"&gt;Willd.&lt;/a&gt; is the currently recognized name for this species, which has been classified under the &lt;a href=\"Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29\"&gt;former names&lt;/a&gt; \"Nelumbium luteum\" and \"Nelumbo pentapetala\", among others.\nDescription.\nAmerican lotus is an emergent &lt;a href=\"aquatic%20plant\"&gt;aquatic plant&lt;/a&gt;. It grows in &lt;a href=\"lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as areas subject to &lt;a href=\"flood\"&gt;flood&lt;/a&gt;ing. The roots are anchored in the mud, but the &lt;a href=\"Leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s emerge above the water's surface. The &lt;a href=\"petiole%20%28botany%29\"&gt;petiole&lt;/a&gt;s of the leaves may extend as much as and end in a round leaf blade in diameter. Mature plants range in height from .\nFlowering begins in late spring and may continue into the summer. The specific name means \"yellow\" in &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; and refers to the &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, which may be white to pale yellow. The flowers measure in diameter and have 22-25 &lt;a href=\"petal\"&gt;petal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is the larval host plant of the American lotus borer, \"&lt;a href=\"Ostrinia%20penitalis\"&gt;Ostrinia penitalis&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHowever, \"Nelumbo lutea\" populations are declining in the U.S. due to habitat destruction and have become an endangered species. Their populations have a low level of genetic diversity, showing variation among different populations rather than within populations.\nRange.\nThe native distribution of the species is &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Honduras\"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. It was apparently distributed northwards in the United States by Native Americans who carried the plant with them as a food source.\nUses.\nThis plant has a large tuberous &lt;a href=\"rhizome\"&gt;rhizome&lt;/a&gt; that is used as a food source. This may be the plant called \"macoupin\" in &lt;a href=\"Miami-Illinois\"&gt;Miami-Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt; is also edible and is known as \"alligator corn\". The seedlike fruits can be shaken loose, and are also edible. The unopened leaves and young stalks can be cooked.\nThe species is widely planted in ponds for its foliage and flowers. American Lotus spreads via creeping rhizomes and seeds. This species has been crossed with \"&lt;a href=\"N.%20nucifera\"&gt;N. nucifera&lt;/a&gt;\" to create many &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28biology%29\"&gt;hybrids&lt;/a&gt;. Seeds may be propagated by &lt;a href=\"Scarification%20%28botany%29\"&gt;scarifying&lt;/a&gt; the pointed tip of the seed with a file then soaking in water. Propagation is also possible by division of established plants.\nOther media.\nDisney's character &lt;a href=\"Tiana%20%28Disney%29\"&gt;Princess Tiana&lt;/a&gt; wears as her iconic princess dress, a gown fashioned from a yellow \"Nelumbo lutea\"."
