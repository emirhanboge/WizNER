    "text": "The Entrance of the flower (, ) is celebrated on 1 February in &lt;a href=\"Torrent%2C%20Valencia\"&gt;Torrent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valencian%20Community\"&gt;Valencian Community&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. The traditional Entrance of the flower is a deep-rooted festivity in the municipality that traces back to the 17th century, in which the clavarios and members of the Confrerie of the Mother of God deliver a branch of the first-blooming &lt;a href=\"Almond\"&gt;almond-tree&lt;/a&gt; to the Virgin.\nOrigins.\nCelebrated on February 1, this is perhaps the showiest rite of the Confrerie. It consists in offering to the Virgin Mary the fruits of the first tree to flower after the winter, that is, the almond tree.\nThe oral tradition says that \"this is a century-old celebration in Torrent. However, it does not know its precise origin, nor when exactly the Confrerie of the Virgin of Rosario and Saint Llu\u00eds Gonzaga became its organiser, although our Record of Refundaci\u00f3n of the year 1940 sample that one of our obligations, from the foundation of the Confrerie, is to offer the novelties that the nature sends us\".\nThis branch short and brings until the parish of Sant Llu\u00eds Bertran, where will initiate the transfer at night.. Once done this, celebrates a breakfast and a multitudinous food in the call \"Caseta of Rosario\". There they go clavarios, managerial board, friends and participants of the act and even municipal authorities\nThe second and primary part of the \"entrada\" is from 20:45. The participants in the transfer gather at the parish of Sant Llu\u00eds Bertran, where they offer a brief prayer and then transfer of the almond branch to the parish of Our Lady of the Assumption. This procession launches rockets attached with \"pinzas\", which makes this act was full of colour and is very pleasant to see.\nFinally, in the parish of the Assumption, the rector of this temple blesses the branch and offers some branches to the Virgin of Rosario. Once it finalises the transfer begins the \"Cord\u00e0\". In an enclosed enclosure and conditioned, the participants launch loose rockets.\nTo participate in the \"Cord\u00e0\" will be indispensable to possess the certificate of Consumer Recognised like Expert (CRE). The participants, so much in the first part of the act (route from the Saint parish Luis Bertr\u00e1n until the parish The Assumption of Our Lady) as in the \"Cord\u00e0\", have to possess the mentioned certificate.\nOther celebrations.\nThroughout the year a number of festivities are being celebrated in the greater area of Torrent."
