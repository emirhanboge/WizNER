    "text": "A madrigal is a &lt;a href=\"secular\"&gt;secular&lt;/a&gt; vocal music composition of the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20music\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; (15th\u201316th c.) and early &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20music\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; (1600\u20131750) eras. The &lt;a href=\"Polyphony\"&gt;polyphonic&lt;/a&gt; madrigal is &lt;a href=\"Accompaniment\"&gt;unaccompanied&lt;/a&gt;, and the number of voices varies from two to eight, but usually features three to six voices, whilst the &lt;a href=\"Metre%20%28music%29\"&gt;metre&lt;/a&gt; of the madrigal varies between two or three &lt;a href=\"tercet\"&gt;tercet&lt;/a&gt;s, followed by one or two &lt;a href=\"couplet\"&gt;couplet&lt;/a&gt;s. Unlike the verse-repeating &lt;a href=\"strophic%20form\"&gt;strophic form&lt;/a&gt;s sung to the same music, most madrigals are &lt;a href=\"through-composed\"&gt;through-composed&lt;/a&gt;, featuring different music for each stanza of lyrics, whereby the composer expresses the emotions contained in each line and in single words of the poem being sung.\nAs written by Italianized Franco\u2013Flemish composers in the &lt;a href=\"1520s%20in%20music\"&gt;1520s&lt;/a&gt;, the madrigal partly originated from the three-to-four voice &lt;a href=\"frottola\"&gt;frottola&lt;/a&gt; (1470\u20131530); partly from composers' renewed interest in poetry written in &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;vernacular Italian&lt;/a&gt;; partly from the stylistic influence of the French &lt;a href=\"chanson\"&gt;chanson&lt;/a&gt;; and from the polyphony of the &lt;a href=\"motet\"&gt;motet&lt;/a&gt; (13th\u201316th c.). The technical contrast between the musical forms is in the frottola consisting of music set to stanzas of text, whilst the madrigal is through-composed, a work with different music for different stanzas. As a composition, the madrigal of the Renaissance is unlike the two-to-three voice &lt;a href=\"Madrigal%20%28Trecento%29\"&gt;Italian Trecento madrigal&lt;/a&gt; (1300\u20131370) of the 14th-century, having in common only the name \"madrigal\", which derives from the Latin \"matricalis\" (maternal) denoting musical work in service to the mother church.\nArtistically, the madrigal was the most important form of secular music in Italy, and reached its formal and historical zenith in the later 16th century, when the madrigal also was taken up by German and English composers, such as &lt;a href=\"John%20Wilbye\"&gt;John Wilbye&lt;/a&gt; (1574\u20131638), &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Weelkes\"&gt;Thomas Weelkes&lt;/a&gt; (1576\u20131623), and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Morley\"&gt;Thomas Morley&lt;/a&gt; (1557\u20131602) of the &lt;a href=\"English%20Madrigal%20School\"&gt;English Madrigal School&lt;/a&gt; (1588\u20131627). Although of British temper, most English madrigals were \"a cappella\" compositions for three to six voices, which either copied or translated the musical styles of the original madrigals from Italy. By the mid 16th century, Italian composers began merging the madrigal into the composition of the &lt;a href=\"cantata\"&gt;cantata&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dialogue\"&gt;dialogue&lt;/a&gt;; and by the early 17th century, the &lt;a href=\"aria\"&gt;aria&lt;/a&gt; replaced the madrigal in &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigins and early madrigals.\nThe madrigal is a musical composition that emerged from the convergence of &lt;a href=\"Humanism\"&gt;humanist&lt;/a&gt; trends in 16th-century Italy. First, renewed interest in the use of Italian as the &lt;a href=\"vernacular%20language\"&gt;vernacular language&lt;/a&gt; for daily life and communication, instead of Latin. In 1501, the literary theorist &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Bembo\"&gt;Pietro Bembo&lt;/a&gt; (1470\u20131547) published an edition of the poet &lt;a href=\"Petrarch\"&gt;Petrarch&lt;/a&gt; (1304\u20131374); and published the \"Oratio pro litteris graecis\" (1453) about achieving graceful writing by applying &lt;a href=\"Prosody%20%28Latin%29\"&gt;Latin prosody&lt;/a&gt;, careful attention to the sounding of words, and &lt;a href=\"syntax\"&gt;syntax&lt;/a&gt;, the positioning of a word within a line of text. As a form of poetry, the madrigal consisted of an irregular number of lines (usually 7\u201311 syllables) without repetition.\nSecond, Italy was the usual destination for the \"&lt;a href=\"oltremontani\"&gt;oltremontani&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"those from beyond the Alps\") composers of the &lt;a href=\"Franco-Flemish%20school\"&gt;Franco-Flemish school&lt;/a&gt;, who were attracted by Italian culture and by employment in the court of an aristocrat or with the Roman Catholic Church. The composers of the Franco-Flemish school had mastered the style of &lt;a href=\"polyphony\"&gt;polyphonic&lt;/a&gt; composition for religious music, and knew the secular compositions of their homelands, such as the &lt;a href=\"chanson\"&gt;chanson&lt;/a&gt;, which much differed from the secular, lighter styles of composition in late-15th- and early-16th-century Italy.\nThird, the printing press facilitated the availability of sheet music in Italy. The musical forms then in common use \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"frottola\"&gt;frottola&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ballata\"&gt;ballata&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"canzonetta\"&gt;canzonetta&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"mascherata\"&gt;mascherata&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 were light compositions with verses of low literary quality. Those musical forms used repetition and soprano-dominated &lt;a href=\"homophony\"&gt;homophony&lt;/a&gt;, chordal textures and styles, which were simpler than the composition styles of the Franco-Flemish school. Moreover, the Italian popular taste in literature was changing from frivolous verse to the type of serious verse used by Bembo and his school, who required more compositional flexibility than that of the frottola, and related musical forms.\nThe madrigal slowly replaced the frottola in the transitional decade of the 1520s. The early madrigals were published in \"Musica di messer Bernardo Pisano sopra le canzone del Petrarcha\" (1520), by &lt;a href=\"Bernardo%20Pisano\"&gt;Bernardo Pisano&lt;/a&gt; (1490\u20131548), while no one composition is named \"madrigal\", some of the settings are Petrarchan in &lt;a href=\"Verse%20form\"&gt;versification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"word-painting\"&gt;word-painting&lt;/a&gt;, which became compositional characteristics of the later madrigal. The \"Madrigali de diversi musici: libro primo de la Serena\" (1530), by &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20Verdelot\"&gt;Philippe Verdelot&lt;/a&gt; (1480\u20131540), included music by &lt;a href=\"Sebastiano%20Festa\"&gt;Sebastiano Festa&lt;/a&gt; (1490\u20131524) and &lt;a href=\"Costanzo%20Festa\"&gt;Costanzo Festa&lt;/a&gt; (1485\u20131545), &lt;a href=\"Maistre%20Jhan\"&gt;Maistre Jhan&lt;/a&gt; (1485\u20131538) and Verdelot, himself.\nIn the 1533\u201334 period, at Venice, Verdelot published two popular books of four-voice madrigals that were reprinted in 1540. In 1536, that publishing success prompted the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Franco-Flemish%20school\"&gt;Franco-Flemish school&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Willaert\"&gt;Adrian Willaert&lt;/a&gt; (1490\u20131562), to rearrange some four-voice madrigals for single-voice and lute. In 1541, Verdelot also published five-voice madrigals and six-voice madrigals. The success of the first book of madrigals, \"Il primo libro di madrigali\" (1539), by &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Arcadelt\"&gt;Jacques Arcadelt&lt;/a&gt; (1507 \u20131568), made it the most reprinted madrigal book of its time. Stylistically, the music in the books of Arcadelt and Verdelot was closer to the French chanson than the Italian frottola and the &lt;a href=\"motet\"&gt;motet&lt;/a&gt;, given that French was their native tongue. As composers, they were attentive to the setting of the text, per Bembo's ideas, and through-composed the music, rather than use the refrain-and-verse constructions common to French secular music.\nMid-16th century.\nAlthough the madrigal originated in the cities of Florence and Rome, by the mid 16th-century Venice had become the centre of musical activity. The political turmoils of the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Rome%20%281527%29\"&gt;Sack of Rome (1527)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Florence%20%281529%E2%80%931530%29\"&gt;Siege of Florence (1529\u20131530)&lt;/a&gt; diminished that city's significance as a musical centre. In addition, Venice was the music publishing centre of Europe; the Basilica of &lt;a href=\"San%20Marco%20di%20Venezia\"&gt;San Marco di Venezia&lt;/a&gt; (St. Mark's Basilica) was beginning to attract musicians from Europe; and Pietro Bembo had returned to Venice in 1529. &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Willaert\"&gt;Adrian Willaert&lt;/a&gt; (1490\u20131562) and his associates at St. Mark's Basilica, &lt;a href=\"Girolamo%20Parabosco\"&gt;Girolamo Parabosco&lt;/a&gt; (1524\u20131557), &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Buus\"&gt;Jacques Buus&lt;/a&gt; (1524\u20131557), and &lt;a href=\"Baldassare%20Donato\"&gt;Baldassare Donato&lt;/a&gt; (1525\u20131603), &lt;a href=\"Perissone%20Cambio\"&gt;Perissone Cambio&lt;/a&gt; (1520\u20131562) and &lt;a href=\"Cipriano%20de%20Rore\"&gt;Cipriano de Rore&lt;/a&gt; (1515\u20131565), were the principal composers of the madrigal at mid-century.\nUnlike Arcadelt and Verdelot, Willaert preferred the complex textures of polyphonic language, thus his madrigals were like motets, although he varied the compositional textures, between homophonic and polyphonic passages, to highlight the text of the stanzas; for verse, Willaert preferred the &lt;a href=\"sonnet\"&gt;sonnet&lt;/a&gt;s of Petrarch. Second to Willaert, Cipriano de Rore was the most influential composer of madrigals; whereas Willaert was restrained and subtle in his settings for the text, striving for homogeneity, rather than sharp contrast, Rore used extravagant rhetorical gestures, including word-painting and unusual &lt;a href=\"chromaticism\"&gt;chromatic&lt;/a&gt; relationships, a compositional trend encouraged by the music theorist &lt;a href=\"Nicola%20Vicentino\"&gt;Nicola Vicentino&lt;/a&gt; (1511\u20131576). From Rore's musical language came the \"madrigalisms\" that made the genre distinctive, and the five-voice texture which became the standard for composition.\n1550s\u20131570s.\nThe latter history of the madrigal begins with Cipriano de Rore, whose works were the elementary musical forms of madrigal composition that existed by the early 17th century. The relevant composers include &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina\"&gt;Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina&lt;/a&gt; (1525\u20131594), who wrote secular music in his early career; &lt;a href=\"Orlande%20de%20Lassus\"&gt;Orlande de Lassus&lt;/a&gt; (1530\u20131594), who wrote the twelve-motet \"&lt;a href=\"Prophetiae%20Sibyllarum\"&gt;Prophetiae Sibyllarum&lt;/a&gt;\" (Sibylline Prophecies, 1600), and later, when he moved to Munich in 1556, began the history of madrigal composition beyond Italy; and &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20de%20Monte\"&gt;Philippe de Monte&lt;/a&gt; (1521\u20131603), the most prolific madrigalist, first published in 1554.\nIn Venice, &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Gabrieli\"&gt;Andrea Gabrieli&lt;/a&gt; (1532\u20131585) composed madrigals with bright, open, polyphonic textures, as in his &lt;a href=\"motet\"&gt;motet&lt;/a&gt; compositions. At the court of &lt;a href=\"Alfonso%20II%20d%27Este%2C%20Duke%20of%20Ferrara\"&gt;Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara&lt;/a&gt; (r. 1559\u20131597), there was the \"&lt;a href=\"Concerto%20delle%20donne\"&gt;Concerto delle donne&lt;/a&gt;\" (1580\u20131597), the concert of the ladies, three women singers for whom &lt;a href=\"Luzzasco%20Luzzaschi\"&gt;Luzzasco Luzzaschi&lt;/a&gt; (1545\u20131607), &lt;a href=\"Giaches%20de%20Wert\"&gt;Giaches de Wert&lt;/a&gt; (1535\u20131596), and &lt;a href=\"Lodovico%20Agostini\"&gt;Lodovico Agostini&lt;/a&gt; (1534\u20131590) composed ornamented madrigals, often with instrumental accompaniment. The great artistic quality of the \"Concerto delle donne\" of Ferrara encouraged composers to visit the court at Ferrara, to listen to women sing and to offer compositions for them to sing. In turn, other cities established their own \"concerto delle donne\", as at Firenze, where the &lt;a href=\"Medici\"&gt;Medici family&lt;/a&gt; commissioned &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Striggio\"&gt;Alessandro Striggio&lt;/a&gt; (1536\u2013 1592) to compose madrigals in the style of Luzzaschi. In Rome, the compositions of &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Marenzio\"&gt;Luca Marenzio&lt;/a&gt; (1553\u20131599) were the madrigals that came closest to unifying the different styles of the time.\nIn the 1560s, &lt;a href=\"Marc%27Antonio%20Ingegneri\"&gt;Marc'Antonio Ingegneri&lt;/a&gt; (1535\u20131592) \u2014 Monteverdi's instructor \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Gabrieli\"&gt;Andrea Gabrieli&lt;/a&gt; (1532\u20131585), and &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Ferretti\"&gt;Giovanni Ferretti&lt;/a&gt; (1540\u20131609) re-incorporated lighter elements of composition to the madrigal; serious Petrarchan verse about &lt;a href=\"Love\"&gt;Love&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nostalgia\"&gt;Longing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; was replaced with the &lt;a href=\"villanella\"&gt;villanella&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"canzonetta\"&gt;canzonetta&lt;/a&gt;, compositions with dance rhythms and verses about a care-free life. In the late 16th century, composers used &lt;a href=\"word-painting\"&gt;word-painting&lt;/a&gt; to apply \"madrigalisms\", passages in which the music matches the meaning of a word in the lyrics; thus, a composer sets \"riso\" (smile) to a passage of quick, running notes that mimic laughter, and sets \"sospiro\" (sigh) to a note that falls to the note below. In the 17th century, acceptance of word-painting as a musical form had changed, in the \"First Book of Ayres\" (1601), the poet and composer &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Campion\"&gt;Thomas Campion&lt;/a&gt; (1567\u20131620) criticised word-painting as a negative mannerism in the madrigal: \"where the nature of everie word is precisely expresst in the Note ... such childish observing of words is altogether ridiculous.\"\nTurn of the century.\nAt the end of the 16th century, the changed social function of the madrigal contributed to its development into new forms of music. Since its invention, the madrigal had two roles: (i) a private entertainment for small groups of skilled, amateur singers and musicians; and (ii) a supplement to ceremonial performances of music for the public. The amateur entertainment function made the madrigal famous, yet professional singers replaced amateur singers when madrigalists composed music of greater range and dramatic force that was more difficult to sing, because the expressed sentiments required soloist singers of great range, rather than an ensemble of singers with mid-range voices.\nThere emerged the division between the active performers and the passive audience, especially in the culturally progressive cities of &lt;a href=\"Ferrara\"&gt;Ferrara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mantua\"&gt;Mantua&lt;/a&gt;. The emotions communicated in a madrigal in 1590, an &lt;a href=\"aria\"&gt;aria&lt;/a&gt; expressed in &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the 17th century, yet composers continued using the madrigal into the new century, such as the old-style madrigal for many voices; the solo madrigal with instrumental accompaniment; and the &lt;a href=\"concertato\"&gt;concertato&lt;/a&gt; madrigal, of which &lt;a href=\"Claudio%20Monteverdi\"&gt;Claudio Monteverdi&lt;/a&gt; (1567\u20131643) was the most famous composer.\nIn Naples, the compositional style of the pupil Carlo Gesualdo followed from the style of his mentor, &lt;a href=\"Luzzasco%20Luzzaschi\"&gt;Luzzasco Luzzaschi&lt;/a&gt; (1545\u20131607), who had published six books of madrigals and the religious music \"&lt;a href=\"Responsories%20for%20Holy%20Week\"&gt;Responsoria pro hebdomada sancta&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Responsories for Holy Week\", 1611). In the early 1590s, Gesualdo had learnt the &lt;a href=\"chromaticism\"&gt;chromaticism&lt;/a&gt; and textural contrasts of Ferrarese composers, such as &lt;a href=\"Alfonso%20Fontanelli\"&gt;Alfonso Fontanelli&lt;/a&gt; (1557\u20131622) and Luzzaschi, but few madrigalists followed his stylistic &lt;a href=\"mannerism\"&gt;mannerism&lt;/a&gt; and extreme chromaticism, which were compositional techniques selectively used by &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Cifra\"&gt;Antonio Cifra&lt;/a&gt; (1584\u20131629), &lt;a href=\"Sigismondo%20d%27India\"&gt;Sigismondo d'India&lt;/a&gt; (1582\u20131629), and &lt;a href=\"Domenico%20Mazzocchi\"&gt;Domenico Mazzocchi&lt;/a&gt; (1592\u20131665) in their musical works. In the 1620s, Gesualdo's successor madrigalist was &lt;a href=\"Michelangelo%20Rossi\"&gt;Michelangelo Rossi&lt;/a&gt; (1601\u20131656), whose two books of unaccompanied madrigals display sustained, extreme chromaticism.\nTransition to the concertato madrigal.\nIn the transition from &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20music\"&gt;Renaissance music&lt;/a&gt; (1400\u20131600) to &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20music\"&gt;Baroque music&lt;/a&gt; (1580\u20131750), &lt;a href=\"Claudio%20Monteverdi\"&gt;Claudio Monteverdi&lt;/a&gt; usually is credited as the principal madrigalist whose nine books of madrigals showed the stylistic, technical transitions from the &lt;a href=\"polyphony\"&gt;polyphony&lt;/a&gt; of the late 16th century to the styles of &lt;a href=\"monody\"&gt;monody&lt;/a&gt; and of the &lt;a href=\"concertato\"&gt;concertato&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by &lt;a href=\"basso%20continuo\"&gt;basso continuo&lt;/a&gt;, of the early Baroque period. As an expressive composer, Monteverdi avoided the stylistic extremes of Gesualdo's chromaticism, and concentrated upon the drama inherent to the madrigal musical form. His fifth and sixth books include polyphonic madrigals for equal voices (in late-16th-century style) and madrigals with solo-voice parts accompanied by basso continuo, which feature unprepared dissonances and &lt;a href=\"recitative\"&gt;recitative&lt;/a&gt; passages \u2014 foreshadowing the compositional integration of the solo madrigal to the &lt;a href=\"aria\"&gt;aria&lt;/a&gt;. In the fifth book of madrigals, using the term \"&lt;a href=\"seconda%20pratica\"&gt;seconda pratica&lt;/a&gt;\" (second practice) Monteverdi said that the lyrics must be \"the mistress of the harmony\" of a madrigal, which was his progressive response to &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Artusi\"&gt;Giovanni Artusi&lt;/a&gt; (1540\u20131613) who negatively defended the limitations of dissonance and equal voice parts of the old-style polyphonic madrigal against the concertato madrigal.&lt;ref name=\"Arnold/Wakelin\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nTransition from the concertato madrigal.\nIn the first decade of the 17th century, the Italian compositional techniques for the madrigal progressed from the old ideal of an \"a cappella\" vocal composition for balanced voices, to a vocal composition for one or more voices with instrumental accompaniment. The inner voices became secondary to the &lt;a href=\"soprano\"&gt;soprano&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bass%20line\"&gt;bass line&lt;/a&gt;; functional tonality developed, and treated dissonance freely for composers to emphasise the dramatic contrast among vocal groups and instruments. The 17th-century madrigal emerged from two trends of musical composition: (i) the solo madrigal with basso continuo; and (ii) the madrigal for two or more voices with basso continuo. In England, composers continued to write ensemble madrigals in the older, 16th-century style. In 1600, the harmonic and dramatic changes in the composition of the madrigal expanded to include instrumental accompaniment, because the madrigal originally was composed for group performance by talented, amateur artists, without a passive audience; thus instruments filled the missing parts. The composer usually did not specify the instrumentation; in \"The Fifth Book of Madrigals\" and in the \"Sixth Book of Madrigals\", &lt;a href=\"Claudio%20Monteverdi\"&gt;Claudio Monteverdi&lt;/a&gt; indicated that the \"basso seguente\", the instrumental bass part, was optional in the ensemble madrigal. The usual instruments for playing the bass line and filling inner voice parts, were the &lt;a href=\"lute\"&gt;lute&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"theorbo\"&gt;theorbo (chitarrone)&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"harpsichord\"&gt;harpsichord&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe madrigalist &lt;a href=\"Giulio%20Caccini\"&gt;Giulio Caccini&lt;/a&gt; (1551\u20131618) produced madrigals in the \"solo continuo\" style, compositions technically related to &lt;a href=\"monody\"&gt;monody&lt;/a&gt; and descended from the experimental music of the &lt;a href=\"Florentine%20Camerata\"&gt;Florentine Camerata&lt;/a&gt; (1573\u20131587). In the collection of solo madrigals, \"Le nuove musiche\" (\"The New Music\", 1601), Caccini said that the point of the composition was anti-contrapuntal, because the lyrics and words of the song were primary, and balanced-voice polyphony interfered with hearing the lyrics of the song. After Caccini's developments, the composers &lt;a href=\"Marco%20da%20Gagliano\"&gt;Marco da Gagliano&lt;/a&gt; (1582\u20131643), &lt;a href=\"Sigismondo%20d%27India\"&gt;Sigismondo d'India&lt;/a&gt; (1582\u20131629), and &lt;a href=\"Claudio%20Saracini\"&gt;Claudio Saracini&lt;/a&gt; (1586\u20131630) also published collections of madrigals in the solo continuo style. Whereas Caccini's music mostly was &lt;a href=\"Diatonic%20and%20chromatic\"&gt;diatonic&lt;/a&gt;, later composers, especially d'India, composed solo continuo madrigals using an experimental idiom of &lt;a href=\"chromaticism\"&gt;chromaticism&lt;/a&gt;. In the \"Seventh Book of Madrigals\" (1619), Monteverdi published his only madrigal in the solo continuo style, which uses one singing voice, and three groups of instruments \u2014 a great technical advance from Caccini's simple voice-and-basso-continuo compositions from the 1600 period.\nBeginning around 1620, the &lt;a href=\"aria\"&gt;aria&lt;/a&gt; supplanted the monodic-style madrigal. In 1618, the last, published book of solo madrigals contained no arias, likewise in that year, books of arias contained no madrigals, thus published arias outnumbered madrigals, and the prolific madrigalists Saracini and d'India ceased publishing in the mid 1620s.\nIn the late 1630s, two madrigal collections summarised the compositional and technical practises of the late-style madrigal. In \"Madrigali a 5 voci in partitura\" (1638), &lt;a href=\"Domenico%20Mazzocchi\"&gt;Domenico Mazzocchi&lt;/a&gt; collected and organised madrigals into &lt;a href=\"Basso%20continuo\"&gt;continuo&lt;/a&gt; and ensemble works specifically composed for \"a cappella\" performance. For the first time in a collection of madrigal music, Mazzocchi published precise instructions, including the symbols for &lt;a href=\"Dynamics%20%28music%29\"&gt;crescendo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"decrescendo\"&gt;decrescendo&lt;/a&gt;; however, those madrigals were for &lt;a href=\"Musicology\"&gt;musicologic study&lt;/a&gt;, not for performance, indicating composer Mazzochi's retrospective review of the madrigal as an old form of musical composition. In the \"Eighth Book of Madrigals\" (1638), Monteverdi published his most famous madrigal, the \"Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda\", a dramatic composition much like a secular &lt;a href=\"oratorio\"&gt;oratorio&lt;/a&gt;, featuring musical innovations such as the \"stile concitato\" (agitated style) that employs the string &lt;a href=\"tremolo\"&gt;tremolo&lt;/a&gt;. In the event, the evolution of musical composition eliminated the madrigal as a discrete musical form; the &lt;a href=\"cantata\"&gt;solo cantata&lt;/a&gt; and the aria supplanted the solo continuo madrigal, and the ensemble madrigal was supplanted by the cantata and the dialogue, and, by 1640, the opera was the predominant dramatic musical form of the 17th century.\nEnglish madrigal school.\nIn 16th-century England, the madrigal became greatly popular upon publication of \"Musica Transalpina\" in (\"Transalpine Music\", 1588), by &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Yonge\"&gt;Nicholas Yonge&lt;/a&gt; (1560\u20131619) a collection of Italian madrigals with corresponding English translations of the lyrics, which later initiated madrigal composition in England. The unaccompanied madrigal survived longer in England than in Continental Europe, where the madrigal musical form had fallen from popular favour, but English madrigalists continued composing and producing music in the Italian style of the late-16th century.\nIn early 18th-century England, &lt;a href=\"catch%20%28music%29\"&gt;catch clubs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"glee%20clubs\"&gt;glee clubs&lt;/a&gt; revived the singing of madrigals, which later was followed by the formation of musical institutions such as the &lt;a href=\"Madrigal%20Society\"&gt;Madrigal Society&lt;/a&gt;, established at London in 1741, by the attorney and amateur musician &lt;a href=\"John%20Immyns\"&gt;John Immyns&lt;/a&gt;. In the 19th century, the madrigal was the best-known music from the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; (15th\u201316th c.) consequent to the prolific publishing of sheet music in the 16th and 17th centuries, even before the rediscovery of the madrigals of the composer &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina\"&gt;Palestrina&lt;/a&gt; (Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina).\nContinental Europe.\nIn the 16th century, the musical form of the Italian madrigal greatly influenced secular music throughout Europe, which composers wrote either in Italian or in their native tongues. The extent of madrigalist musical influence depended upon the cultural strength of the local tradition of secular music. In France, the native composition of the \"&lt;a href=\"Chanson\"&gt;chanson&lt;/a&gt;\" disallowed the development of a French-style madrigal; nonetheless, French composers such as &lt;a href=\"Orlande%20de%20Lassus\"&gt;Orlande de Lassus&lt;/a&gt; (1532\u20131594) and &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Le%20Jeune\"&gt;Claude Le Jeune&lt;/a&gt; (1528\u20131600) applied madrigalian techniques in their musics. In the Netherlands, &lt;a href=\"Cornelis%20Verdonck\"&gt;Cornelis Verdonck&lt;/a&gt; (1563\u20131625), &lt;a href=\"Hubert%20Waelrant\"&gt;Hubert Waelrant&lt;/a&gt; (1517\u20131595), and &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Pieterszoon%20Sweelinck\"&gt;Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck&lt;/a&gt; (1562\u20131621) composed madrigals in Italian.\nIn German-speaking Europe, the prolific composers of madrigals included Lassus in Munich and &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20de%20Monte\"&gt;Philippe de Monte&lt;/a&gt; (1521\u20131603) in Vienna. The German-speaking composers who studied the Italian techniques for composing madrigals, especially in Venice, included &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Leo%20Hassler\"&gt;Hans Leo Hassler&lt;/a&gt; (1564\u20131612) who studied with &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Gabrieli\"&gt;Andrea Gabrieli&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Sch%C3%BCtz\"&gt;Heinrich Sch\u00fctz&lt;/a&gt; (1585\u20131672) who studied with &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Gabrieli\"&gt;Giovanni Gabrieli&lt;/a&gt;. From northern Europe, Danish and Polish court composers went to Italy to learn the Italian style of madrigal; while &lt;a href=\"Luca%20Marenzio\"&gt;Luca Marenzio&lt;/a&gt; (1553\u20131599) went to the Polish court to work as the \"maestro di cappella\" (Master of the Chapel) for King &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%20III%20Vasa\"&gt;Sigismund III Vasa&lt;/a&gt; (r. 1587\u20131632) in Warsaw. Moreover, the \"rektor\" of the University of Wittenberg, &lt;a href=\"Caspar%20Ziegler\"&gt;Caspar Ziegler&lt;/a&gt; (1621\u20131690) and Heinrich Sch\u00fctz wrote the treatise \"Von den Madrigalen\" (1653).\nMadrigalists.\nBaroque madrigalists.\nThe \"a capella\" old-style madrigal for four or five voices continued in parallel with the new \"concertato\" style of madrigal, but the compositional watershed of the \"seconda prattica\" provided an autonomous basso continuo line, presented in the \"Fifth Book of Madrigals\" (1605), by Claudio Monteverdi.\nEnglish madrigal school.\nSome 60 madrigals of the English School are published in &lt;a href=\"The%20Oxford%20Book%20of%20English%20Madrigals\"&gt;The Oxford Book of English Madrigals&lt;/a&gt;"
