It has been one of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20largest%20cities%20throughout%20history\"&gt;world's largest cities&lt;/a&gt;, enjoying peace and prosperity despite wars and disasters. Nanjing served as the capital of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Wu\"&gt;Eastern Wu&lt;/a&gt; (229\u2013280), one of the three major states in the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Three Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; period; the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Jin%20dynasty\"&gt;Eastern Jin&lt;/a&gt; and each of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20and%20Northern%20dynasties\"&gt;Southern dynasties&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Liu%20Song%20dynasty\"&gt;Liu Song&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Qi\"&gt;Southern Qi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liang%20dynasty\"&gt;Liang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20dynasty\"&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt;), which successively ruled southern China from 317 to 589; the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Tang\"&gt;Southern Tang&lt;/a&gt; (937\u201375), one of the &lt;a href=\"Ten%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Ten Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Ming%20dynasty\"&gt;Ming dynasty&lt;/a&gt; when, for the first time, all of China was ruled from the city (1368\u20131421); and the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; under the nationalist &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; (1927\u201337, 1946\u201349) prior to its flight to &lt;a href=\"Geography%20of%20Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-Shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-Shek&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Chinese Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. The city also served as the seat of the rebel &lt;a href=\"Taiping%20Heavenly%20Kingdom\"&gt;Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (1853\u201364) and the &lt;a href=\"Reorganized%20National%20Government%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Japanese puppet regime of Wang Jingwei&lt;/a&gt; (1940\u201345) during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War\"&gt;Second Sino-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt;. It suffered severe atrocities in both conflicts, such as the &lt;a href=\"Nanjing%20massacre\"&gt;Nanjing massacre&lt;/a&gt;.\nNanjing has served as the capital city of Jiangsu province since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It has many important heritage sites, including the &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Palace%20%28Nanjing%29\"&gt;Presidential Palace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yat-sen%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;. Nanjing is famous for human historical landscapes, mountains and waters such as &lt;a href=\"Nanjing%20Fuzimiao\"&gt;Fuzimiao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Palace\"&gt;Ming Palace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaotian%20Palace\"&gt;Chaotian Palace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Porcelain%20Tower%20of%20Nanjing\"&gt;Porcelain Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drum%20Tower%20of%20Nanjing\"&gt;Drum Tower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stone%20City\"&gt;Stone City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"City%20Wall%20of%20Nanjing\"&gt;City Wall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qinhuai%20River\"&gt;Qinhuai River&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xuanwu%20Lake\"&gt;Xuanwu Lake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Mountain%20%28Nanjing%29\"&gt;Purple Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Key cultural facilities include &lt;a href=\"Nanjing%20Library\"&gt;Nanjing Library&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nanjing%20Museum\"&gt;Nanjing Museum&lt;/a&gt; and Jiangsu Art Museum.\nNames.\nThe city has a number of other names, and some historical names are now used as names of districts of the city; among them there is the name Jiangning or Kiangning (), whose former character Jiang (, Yangtze) is the former part of the name &lt;a href=\"Jiangsu\"&gt;Jiangsu&lt;/a&gt; and latter character Ning (, simplified form ) is the short name of Nanjing. When it was the capital of China, for instance under the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%9349%29\"&gt;ROC&lt;/a&gt;, Jing () was adopted as the abbreviation of Nanjing.\nThe city first became a Chinese national capital as early as the &lt;a href=\"Jin%20dynasty%20%28265%E2%80%93420%29\"&gt;Jin dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The name Nanjing, which means \"Southern Capital\", was officially designated for the city during the &lt;a href=\"Ming%20dynasty\"&gt;Ming dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, about six hundred years later. Nanjing is sometimes known as Jinling or Ginling (, \"Gold Hill\") of the eponymous &lt;a href=\"Ginling%20College\"&gt;Ginling College&lt;/a&gt;; the old name has been used since the &lt;a href=\"Warring%20States%20period\"&gt;Warring States period&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20dynasty\"&gt;Zhou dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. In English, the spelling Nanking was traditional until &lt;a href=\"Pinyin\"&gt;Pinyin&lt;/a&gt;-developed in the 1950s and internationally adopted in the 1980s- standardized the spelling as \"Nanjing\".\nHistory.\nEarly history and foundation.\nArchaeological discovery shows that \"&lt;a href=\"Nanjing%20Man\"&gt;Nanjing Man&lt;/a&gt;\" lived more than 500 thousand years ago. &lt;a href=\"Zun\"&gt;Zun&lt;/a&gt;, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. There were ancient human activities in the Nanjing area 6.000 years ago. The Homo Erectus discovered in Tangshan Gourd Cave lived between 2.000 and 6.000 ago. About 7.000 years ago, there was an agricultural civilitation in Qixia area today. In the downtown area of Gulou Gangbei Yinyangying and Taowu Township, Jiangning District, the ruins of primitive villages from the Neolithic Age were discovered more than 6000 years ago. About 4000 years ago, dense Bronze Age primitive settlements appeared in the Qinhuai River Basin, known as the Hushu Culture. Based on these settlements, the earliest cities in Nanjing were formed. Hushu culture developed into Wu culture under the influence of Shang and Zhou cultures in the Central Plains. In 571 BC, the State of Chu established Tangyi in Liuhe, and the Tangyi doctor was set up. This is the earliest administrative establishment in Nanjing in history, and it has a history of 2591 by 2020. In 541 BC, Wu State built Laizhu Town in Gaochun. Because of its strong city, it was also called Gucheng. In 473 years ago, Wu was destroyed by Yue, and the city was built at the mouth of the Qinhuai River in the following year. Later it was called Yuecheng, which was the beginning of the construction of the main city of Nanjing. In 333 BC, Chu defeated Yue and built Jinling Town on the Stone Mountain by the river. It was the earliest administrative construction in the main city of Nanjing. The name of Jinling comes from this. In 210 BC, the first emperor of Qin visited the east and changed Jinling City to Moling County,\nIn the late period of &lt;a href=\"Shang%20dynasty\"&gt;Shang dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taibo%20of%20Wu\"&gt;Taibo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Predynastic%20Zhou\"&gt;Zhou&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Jiangnan\"&gt;Jiangnan&lt;/a&gt; and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to a legend quoted by an artist in Ming dynasty, Chen Yi, &lt;a href=\"Fuchai\"&gt;Fuchai&lt;/a&gt;, King of the &lt;a href=\"Wu%20%28state%29\"&gt;State of Wu&lt;/a&gt;, founded a fort named Yecheng in today's Nanjing area in 495BC. Later in 473BC, the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Yue\"&gt;State of Yue&lt;/a&gt; conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng () on the outskirts of the present-day &lt;a href=\"Zhonghua%20Gate\"&gt;Zhonghua Gate&lt;/a&gt;. In 333BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the &lt;a href=\"Chu%20%28state%29\"&gt;State of Chu&lt;/a&gt; built Jinling Yi () in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling () during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Qin%20Shi%20Huang\"&gt;the First Emperor of Qin&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times. The area was successively part of &lt;a href=\"Kuaiji%20Prefecture\"&gt;Kuaiji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zhang%20Prefecture\"&gt;Zhang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Danyang%20Prefecture\"&gt;Danyang&lt;/a&gt; prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Yangzhou%20%28ancient%20China%29\"&gt;Yangzhou&lt;/a&gt; for about 400 years from late &lt;a href=\"Han%20dynasty\"&gt;Han&lt;/a&gt; to early &lt;a href=\"Tang%20dynasty\"&gt;Tang&lt;/a&gt;.\nCapital of the Six Dynasties.\nNanjing first became a state capital in AD229, when the state of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Wu\"&gt;Eastern Wu&lt;/a&gt; founded by &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Quan\"&gt;Sun Quan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Three Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; period relocated its capital to &lt;a href=\"Jiankang\"&gt;Jianye&lt;/a&gt; (), the city extended on the basis of Jinling Yi in AD211. Although conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Jin%20dynasty%20%28265%E2%80%93420%29\"&gt;Western Jin dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in 280, Nanjing and its neighboring areas had been well cultivated, developing into one of the commercial, cultural and political centers of China during the Eastern Wu. This city would soon play a vital role in the following centuries. At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Sun Quan, who ruled Jiangdong, moved his ruling office to Moling in 211. The following year, he built a stone city fortress in the old place of Jinling Town. In 229, Sun Quan proclaimed himself emperor in Wuchang and established Dong Wu (Eastern Wu). Then he moved his capital to Jianye, known as the \"Zhongshan Dragon Plate, Stone Tigers\", and opened the history of Nanjing as the capital. In 280, the Western Jin Dynasty destroyed Wu and rebuilt the industry into Moling. In 282, with the Qinhuai River as the boundary, Moling was divided into two counties, Jianye and Moling. In 313, Ye was renamed Jiankang because of avoiding the name taboo of Emperor Sima Ye of the Jin Dynasty. In 317, Emperor Sima Rui of the Jin and Yuan dynasties was building a country, known as the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and the northern gentry moved south. After more than 270 years of the Great Separatism between North and South, Jiankang became the orthodox place of China.\nShortly after the unification of the region, the Western Jin dynasty collapsed. First the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Eight%20Princes\"&gt;rebellions by eight Jin princes&lt;/a&gt; for the throne and later rebellions and invasion from &lt;a href=\"Xiongnu\"&gt;Xiongnu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Five%20Barbarians\"&gt;other nomadic peoples&lt;/a&gt; that destroyed the rule of the Jin dynasty in the north. In 317, remnants of the Jin court, as well as nobles and wealthy families, fled from the north to the south and reestablished the Jin court in Nanjing, which was then called &lt;a href=\"Jiankang\"&gt;Jiankang&lt;/a&gt; (), replacing &lt;a href=\"Luoyang\"&gt;Luoyang&lt;/a&gt;. This marked the first time a Chinese dynastic capital moved to &lt;a href=\"Northern%20and%20southern%20China\"&gt;southern China&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the period of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20and%20Northern%20Dynasties\"&gt;North\u2013South division&lt;/a&gt;, Nanjing remained the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20dynasties\"&gt;Southern dynasties&lt;/a&gt; for more than two and a half centuries. During this time, Nanjing was the international hub of East Asia. Based on historical documents, the city had 280,000 registered households. Assuming an average Nanjing household consisted of about 5.1 people, the city had more than 1.4\u00a0million residents.\nA number of &lt;a href=\"spirit%20way\"&gt;sculptural ensembles&lt;/a&gt; of that era, erected at the tombs of royals and other dignitaries, have survived (in various degrees of preservation) in Nanjing's northeastern and eastern suburbs, primarily in &lt;a href=\"Qixia%20District\"&gt;Qixia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jiangning%20District\"&gt;Jiangning District&lt;/a&gt;. Possibly the best preserved of them is the ensemble of the Tomb of &lt;a href=\"Xiao%20Xiu\"&gt;Xiao Xiu&lt;/a&gt; (475\u2013518), a brother of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Wu%20of%20Liang\"&gt;Emperor Wu of Liang&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Six%20Dynasties\"&gt;Six Dynasties&lt;/a&gt; is a collective term for six Chinese dynasties mentioned above which all maintained national capitals at Jiankang. The six dynasties were: &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Wu\"&gt;Eastern Wu&lt;/a&gt; (222\u2013280), &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Jin%20dynasty\"&gt;Eastern Jin dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (317\u2013420) and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20and%20Southern%20dynasties\"&gt;four southern dynasties&lt;/a&gt; (420\u2013589).\nDestruction and revival.\nThe period of division ended when the &lt;a href=\"Sui%20dynasty\"&gt;Sui dynasty&lt;/a&gt; reunified China and almost destroyed the entire city, turning it into a small town. The city was razed after the Sui took it over. It was renamed Shengzhou () in the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20dynasty\"&gt;Tang dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and resuscitated during the late Tang.\nIt was chosen as the capital and called Jinling () during the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Tang\"&gt;Southern Tang&lt;/a&gt; (937\u2013976), which succeeded the state of &lt;a href=\"Yang%20Wu\"&gt;Yang Wu&lt;/a&gt;. It was renamed Jiangning () in the &lt;a href=\"Song%20dynasty\"&gt;Northern Song&lt;/a&gt; and renamed Jiankang in the &lt;a href=\"Song%20dynasty%23Southern%20Song%2C%201127%E2%80%931279\"&gt;Southern Song&lt;/a&gt;. Jiankang's textile industry burgeoned and thrived during the Song despite the constant threat of foreign &lt;a href=\"Jin%E2%80%93Song%20Wars\"&gt;invasions from the north&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Jurchen%20people\"&gt;Jurchen&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href=\"Jin%20dynasty%20%281115%E2%80%931234%29\"&gt;Jin dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The court of &lt;a href=\"Da%20Chu\"&gt;Da Chu&lt;/a&gt;, a short-lived puppet state established by the Jurchens, and the court of Song were once in the city.\nThe Southern Song were eventually destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Mongols\"&gt;Mongols&lt;/a&gt;; during their rule as the &lt;a href=\"Yuan%20dynasty\"&gt;Yuan dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, the city's status as a hub of the textile industry was further consolidated. According to &lt;a href=\"Odoric%20of%20Pordenone\"&gt;Odoric of Pordenone&lt;/a&gt;, Chilenfu (Nanjing) had 360 stone bridges, which were finer than anywhere else in the world. It was well populated and had a large craft industry.\nSouthern capital of Ming dynasty.\nThe first emperor of the &lt;a href=\"Ming%20dynasty\"&gt;Ming dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, Zhu Yuanzhang (the &lt;a href=\"Hongwu%20Emperor\"&gt;Hongwu Emperor&lt;/a&gt;), who overthrew the Yuan dynasty, renamed the city Yingtian (), rebuilt it, and made it the dynastic capital in 1368. He constructed a long &lt;a href=\"City%20Wall%20of%20Nanjing\"&gt;city wall around Yingtian&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a new &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Palace\"&gt;Ming Palace&lt;/a&gt; complex, and government halls. It took 200,000 laborers 21\u00a0years to finish the wall, which was intended to defend the city and its surrounding region from coastal pirates. The present-day &lt;a href=\"City%20Wall%20of%20Nanjing\"&gt;City Wall of Nanjing&lt;/a&gt; was mainly built during that time and today it remains in good condition and has been well preserved. It is among the longest surviving &lt;a href=\"city%20wall\"&gt;city wall&lt;/a&gt;s in China. The &lt;a href=\"Jianwen%20Emperor\"&gt;Jianwen Emperor&lt;/a&gt; ruled from 1398 to 1402.\nIt is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400. In 1421, the &lt;a href=\"Yongle%20Emperor\"&gt;Yongle Emperor&lt;/a&gt; relocated the capital to Beijing. The city began to be called the 'southern capital' \u2013 Nanjing (), in comparison to the capital in the north. His successor, the &lt;a href=\"Hongxi%20Emperor\"&gt;Hongxi Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, wished to revert the relocation of the imperial capital from Nanjing to Beijing that had happened during the Yongle reign. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Admiral &lt;a href=\"Zheng%20He\"&gt;Zheng He&lt;/a&gt; as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the &lt;a href=\"Ming%20treasure%20fleet\"&gt;Ming treasure fleet&lt;/a&gt; for the city's defense. Zheng He governed the city with three eunuchs for internal matters and two military noblemen for external matters, awaiting the Hongxi Emperor's return along with the military establishment from the north. The emperor died on 29 May 1425 before this could have taken place, so Beijing remained the \"de facto\" capital and Nanjing remained the secondary capital. The succeeding &lt;a href=\"Xuande%20Emperor\"&gt;Xuande Emperor&lt;/a&gt; remained in Beijing, so the aforementioned Nanjing government eventually became a permanent institution. In official Ming documents of 1425 to 1441, Nanjing was designated as the capital and Beijing was designated as the temporary capital. In 1441, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Yingzong%20of%20Ming\"&gt;Emperor Yingzong&lt;/a&gt; ordered to not to prefix the word \"provisional\" () on the Beijing Government seals any longer, while Nanjing's need to prefix \"Nanjing\" for distinguishing purposes remained. Hence, Nanjing still had itself imperial government with extremely limited power before 1644.\nBesides the city wall, other Ming-era structures in the city included the famous &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Xiaoling%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Porcelain%20Tower%20of%20Nanjing\"&gt;Porcelain Tower&lt;/a&gt;, although the latter was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Taiping%20Rebellion\"&gt;Taipings&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century either to prevent a hostile faction from using it to observe and shell the city or from superstitious fear of its &lt;a href=\"fengshui\"&gt;geomantic properties&lt;/a&gt;.\nA monument to the huge human cost of some of the gigantic construction projects of the early Ming dynasty is the &lt;a href=\"Yangshan%20Quarry\"&gt;Yangshan Quarry&lt;/a&gt; (located some east of the walled city and Ming Xiaoling mausoleum), where a gigantic &lt;a href=\"stele\"&gt;stele&lt;/a&gt;, cut on the orders of the Yongle Emperor, lies abandoned, just as it was left 600\u00a0years ago when it was understood it was impossible to move or complete it.\nAs the center of the empire, early-Ming Nanjing had worldwide connections. It was home of the admiral &lt;a href=\"Zheng%20He\"&gt;Zheng He&lt;/a&gt;, who went to &lt;a href=\"Treasure%20voyages\"&gt;sail the Pacific and Indian Oceans&lt;/a&gt;, and it was visited by foreign dignitaries, such as a king from Borneo (), who died during his visit to China in 1408. The &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20King%20of%20Boni\"&gt;Tomb of the King of Boni&lt;/a&gt;, with a spirit way and a &lt;a href=\"bixi%20%28tortoise%29\"&gt;tortoise stele&lt;/a&gt;, was discovered in &lt;a href=\"Yuhuatai%20District\"&gt;Yuhuatai District&lt;/a&gt; (south of the walled city) in 1958, and has been restored.\nOver two centuries after the removal of the capital to Beijing, Nanjing was destined to become the capital of a Ming emperor one more time. After the fall of Beijing to &lt;a href=\"Li%20Zicheng\"&gt;Li Zicheng&lt;/a&gt;'s rebel forces and then to the &lt;a href=\"Manchu%20people\"&gt;Manchu&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href=\"Qing%20dynasty\"&gt;Qing dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in the spring of 1644, the Ming prince &lt;a href=\"Zhu%20Yousong%2C%20Prince%20of%20Fu\"&gt;Zhu Yousong&lt;/a&gt; was enthroned in Nanjing in June 1644 as the Hongguang Emperor. His short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Ming%20dynasty\"&gt;Southern Ming dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nZhu Yousong, however, fared a lot worse than his ancestor Zhu Yuanzhang three centuries earlier. Beset by factional conflicts, his regime could not offer effective resistance to Qing forces, when the Qing army, led by the Manchu prince &lt;a href=\"Dodo%20%28prince%29\"&gt;Dodo&lt;/a&gt; approached &lt;a href=\"Jiangnan\"&gt;Jiangnan&lt;/a&gt; the next spring. Days after &lt;a href=\"Yangzhou\"&gt;Yangzhou&lt;/a&gt; fell to the Manchus in late May 1645, the Hongguang Emperor fled Nanjing, and the imperial Ming Palace was looted by local residents. On June 6, Dodo's troops approached Nanjing, and the commander of the city's garrison, Zhao the Earl of Xincheng, promptly surrendered the city to them. The Manchus soon ordered all male residents of the city to shave their heads in the &lt;a href=\"Queue%20%28hairstyle%29\"&gt;Manchu queue way&lt;/a&gt;. They requisitioned a large section of the city for the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Banners\"&gt;bannermen&lt;/a&gt;'s cantonment, and occupied the former imperial &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Palace\"&gt;Ming Palace&lt;/a&gt;, but otherwise the city was spared the mass murders and destruction that &lt;a href=\"Yangzhou%20massacre\"&gt;befell Yangzhou&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, &lt;a href=\"Koxinga\"&gt;Koxinga&lt;/a&gt; announced the final battle in Nanjing in 1659 ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown as his father successfully did against the Dutch at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Liaoluo%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Liaoluo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing. The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24. Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements\u2014though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived. Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.\nQing dynasty and Taiping Rebellion.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Qing%20dynasty\"&gt;Qing dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (1644\u20131911), the Nanjing area was known as Jiangning and served as the seat of government for the &lt;a href=\"Viceroy%20of%20Liangjiang\"&gt;Viceroy of Liangjiang&lt;/a&gt;. It was the site of a &lt;a href=\"Qing%20Army\"&gt;Qing Army&lt;/a&gt; garrison. It had been visited by the &lt;a href=\"Kangxi%20Emperor\"&gt;Kangxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Qianlong%20Emperor\"&gt;Qianlong&lt;/a&gt; emperors a number of times on their tours of the southern provinces. The 1842 &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Nanking\"&gt;Treaty of Nanking&lt;/a&gt;, which put an end to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Opium%20War\"&gt;First Opium War&lt;/a&gt;, was signed in the city harbor on &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; warships. As the capital of the brief-lived rebel &lt;a href=\"Taiping%20Heavenly%20Kingdom\"&gt;Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-19th century, Nanjing was known as Tianjing (). The &lt;a href=\"Taiping%20rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; destroyed most of the former Ming imperial buildings in the city, including the &lt;a href=\"Porcelain%20Tower%20of%20Nanjing\"&gt;Porcelain Tower of Nanjing&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth the Qing viceroy and the Taiping king resided in buildings that would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Building%20%28Nanjing%29\"&gt;Presidential Palace&lt;/a&gt;. When Qing forces led by &lt;a href=\"Zeng%20Guofan\"&gt;Zeng Guofan&lt;/a&gt; retook the city in 1864, a massive slaughter occurred in the city with over 100,000 estimated to have committed suicide or fought to the death. Since the Taiping Rebellion began, Qing forces allowed no rebels speaking its dialect to surrender. This systematic mass murder of civilians occurred in Nanjing.\nThe New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent, Virgil Hart arrived in Nanking in 1881. After some time, he eventually thwarted its officials by buying a piece of property near the South Gate and Confucius Temple; to build the city's first Methodist Church, western hospital (Blackstone Methodist Hospital) and Boys' School. The hospital would later be unified with the Drum Tower Hospital and the Boys' School would be expanded by later Missionaries to become the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Nanking\"&gt;University of Nanking&lt;/a&gt; and Medical School. The old Mission property would become the No. 13 Middle School, the city's oldest/continuous school grounds in the city.\nCapital of the republic and Nanking Massacre.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution\"&gt;Xinhai Revolution&lt;/a&gt; led to the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%9349%29\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; in January 1912 with &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yat-sen\"&gt;Sun Yat-sen&lt;/a&gt; as the first provisional president and Nanjing was selected as its new capital. However, the Qing Empire controlled large regions to the north, so revolutionaries asked &lt;a href=\"Yuan%20Shikai\"&gt;Yuan Shikai&lt;/a&gt; to replace Sun as president in exchange for the abdication of &lt;a href=\"Puyi\"&gt;Puyi&lt;/a&gt;, the last emperor. Yuan demanded the capital be Beijing (closer to his power base).\nIn 1927, the &lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; (KMT; Nationalist Party) under Generalissimo &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt; again established Nanjing as the capital of the Republic of China, and this became internationally recognized once KMT forces took Beijing in 1928. The following decade is known as the &lt;a href=\"Nanking%20decade\"&gt;Nanking decade&lt;/a&gt;. During this decade, Nanjing was of symbolic and strategic importance. The Ming dynasty had made Nanjing a capital, the republic had been established there in 1912, and &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yat-sen\"&gt;Sun Yat-sen&lt;/a&gt;'s provisional government had been there. Sun's body was brought and placed in a &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yat-sen%20Mausoleum\"&gt;grand mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; to cement Chiang's legitimacy. Chiang was born in the neighboring province of &lt;a href=\"Zhejiang\"&gt;Zhejiang&lt;/a&gt; and the general area had strong popular support for him.\nIn 1927, the Nationalist government proposed a comprehensive planning proposal, the Capital Plan (), to reconstruct the war-torn city of Nanjing into a modern capital. It was a decade of extraordinary growth with an enormous amount of construction. A lot of government buildings, residential houses, and modern public infrastructures were built. During this boom, Nanjing reputedly became one of the most modern cities in China.\nIn 1937, the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Empire of Japan&lt;/a&gt; started a full-scale invasion of China after invading Manchuria in 1931, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War\"&gt;Second Sino-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt; (often considered a theater of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;). Their troops occupied Nanjing in December and carried out the systematic and brutal &lt;a href=\"Nanking%20massacre\"&gt;Nanking massacre&lt;/a&gt; (the \"Rape of Nanking\"). Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Army\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Army&lt;/a&gt;. The total death toll, including estimates made by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Military%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20Far%20East\"&gt;International Military Tribunal for the Far East&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nanjing%20War%20Crimes%20Tribunal\"&gt;Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; after the atomic bombings, was between 300,000 and 350,000. The city itself was also severely damaged during the massacre. The &lt;a href=\"Nanjing%20Massacre%20Memorial%20Hall\"&gt;Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall&lt;/a&gt; was built in 1985 to commemorate this event.\nA few days before the fall of the city, the National Government of China was relocated to the southwestern city &lt;a href=\"Chongqing\"&gt;Chungking (Chongqing)&lt;/a&gt; and resumed Chinese resistance. In 1940, a Japanese-collaborationist government known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Wang%20Jingwei%20Government\"&gt;Nanjing Regime&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"Reorganized National Government of China\" led by &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Jingwei\"&gt;Wang Jingwei&lt;/a&gt; was established in Nanjing as a rival to &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt;'s government in Chongqing. In 1946, after the &lt;a href=\"Surrender%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Surrender of Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the KMT relocated its central government back to Nanjing.\nChinese Civil War and People's Republic.\nOn 21 April 1949, Communist forces crossed the &lt;a href=\"Yangtze%20River\"&gt;Yangtze River&lt;/a&gt;. On April 23, the Communist &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Liberation%20Army\"&gt;People's Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; (PLA) captured Nanjing. The KMT government retreated to Canton (&lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;) until October 15, &lt;a href=\"Chongqing\"&gt;Chongqing&lt;/a&gt; until November 25, and then &lt;a href=\"Chengdu\"&gt;Chengdu&lt;/a&gt; before retreating to the &lt;a href=\"Geography%20of%20Taiwan\"&gt;island of Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; on December 10 where &lt;a href=\"Taipei\"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; was proclaimed the &lt;a href=\"temporary%20capital\"&gt;temporary capital&lt;/a&gt; of the Republic of China. By late 1949, the PLA was pursuing remnants of KMT forces southwards in southern China, and only &lt;a href=\"Tibet%20%281912%E2%80%9351%29\"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hainan%20Island\"&gt;Hainan Island&lt;/a&gt; were left.\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Nanjing was initially a &lt;a href=\"province-level%20municipality\"&gt;province-level municipality&lt;/a&gt;, but it was soon merged into &lt;a href=\"Jiangsu\"&gt;Jiangsu&lt;/a&gt; and again became the provincial capital by replacing &lt;a href=\"Zhenjiang\"&gt;Zhenjiang&lt;/a&gt; which was transferred in 1928, and retains that status to this day.\nGeography.\nNanjing, with a total land area of , is situated in the heartland of the &lt;a href=\"drainage%20area\"&gt;drainage area&lt;/a&gt; of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the largest economic zones of China. The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then the north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south sides of the city. The city is southeast of &lt;a href=\"Luoyang\"&gt;Luoyang&lt;/a&gt;, south-southeast of Beijing, west-northwest of Shanghai, and east-northeast of &lt;a href=\"Chongqing\"&gt;Chongqing&lt;/a&gt;. The Yangtze River flows downstream from &lt;a href=\"Jiujiang\"&gt;Jiujiang&lt;/a&gt;, Jiangxi, through &lt;a href=\"Anhui\"&gt;Anhui&lt;/a&gt; and Jiangsu to the East China Sea. The northern part of the lower Yangtze drainage basin is the &lt;a href=\"Huai%20River\"&gt;Huai River&lt;/a&gt; basin and the southern part is the &lt;a href=\"Zhe%20River\"&gt;Zhe River&lt;/a&gt; basin; they are connected by the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Canal%20%28China%29\"&gt;Grand Canal&lt;/a&gt; east of Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Xiajiang (, Downstream River) region, with &lt;a href=\"Jianghuai\"&gt;Jianghuai&lt;/a&gt; dominant in the northern part and &lt;a href=\"Wu%20%28region%29\"&gt;Jiangzhe&lt;/a&gt; dominant in the southern part. The region is also well known as Dongnan (, South East, the Southeast) and &lt;a href=\"Jiangnan\"&gt;Jiangnan&lt;/a&gt; (, and River South, South of Yangtze).\nNanjing borders &lt;a href=\"Yangzhou\"&gt;Yangzhou&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast (one town downstream when following the north bank of the Yangtze); &lt;a href=\"Zhenjiang\"&gt;Zhenjiang&lt;/a&gt; to the east (one town downstream when following the south bank of the Yangtze); and &lt;a href=\"Changzhou\"&gt;Changzhou&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast. On its western boundary is &lt;a href=\"Anhui\"&gt;Anhui&lt;/a&gt;, where Nanjing borders five prefecture-level cities: &lt;a href=\"Chuzhou\"&gt;Chuzhou&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest, &lt;a href=\"Wuhu\"&gt;Wuhu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaohu\"&gt;Chaohu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ma%27anshan\"&gt;Ma'anshan&lt;/a&gt; to the west and &lt;a href=\"Xuancheng\"&gt;Xuancheng&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest.\nNanjing is at the intersection of the Yangtze River, an east\u2013west water transport artery, and the Nanjing\u2013Beijing railway, a north\u2013south land transport artery, hence the name \u201cdoor of the east and west, throat of the south and north\u201d. Furthermore, the west part of the Ningzhen range is in Nanjing; the Loong-like Zhong Mountain curls round the east side of the city, while the tiger-like Stone Mountain crouches in the west of the city, hence the name \u201cthe Zhong Mountain, a dragon curling, and the Stone Mountain, a tiger crouching\u201d.\nClimate and environment.\nNanjing has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20subtropical%20climate\"&gt;humid subtropical climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; \"Cfa\") and is influenced by the East Asian &lt;a href=\"monsoon\"&gt;monsoon&lt;/a&gt;. The four seasons are distinct, with damp conditions seen throughout the year, very hot and muggy summers, cold, damp winters, and in between, spring and autumn are of reasonable length. Along with &lt;a href=\"Chongqing\"&gt;Chongqing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wuhan\"&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt;, Nanjing is traditionally referred to as one of the \"&lt;a href=\"Three%20Furnaces\"&gt;Three Furnaces&lt;/a&gt;\" along the Yangtze River for the perennially high temperatures in the summertime. However, the time from mid-June to the end of July is the &lt;a href=\"plum%20blossom\"&gt;plum blossom&lt;/a&gt; blooming season in which the \"&lt;a href=\"meiyu\"&gt;meiyu&lt;/a&gt;\" (rainy season of East Asia; literally \"plum rain\") occurs, during which the city experiences a period of mild rain as well as dampness. Since the meteorological record was made in 1905, the temperature has experienced a change of first rising, then falling and rising. The northeast wind prevails in winter. The average temperature in January is , and the extreme daily minimum temperature is , which occurred on January 6, 1955. The southeast wind prevails in summer, with an average temperature of in July and an extreme daily maximum temperature of , which occurred on July 13, 1934. The number of precipitation days greater than 0.1\u00a0mm was 113.7 days, and the extreme maximum annual precipitation days were 160 days in 1957. The average annual precipitation was .\nTyphoons are uncommon but possible in the late stages of summer and early part of autumn. The annual mean temperature is around , with the monthly 24-hour average temperature ranging from in January to in July. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 6 January 1955 to on 22 August 1959. On average precipitation falls 115\u00a0days out of the year, and the average annual rainfall is . With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37\u00a0percent in March to 52\u00a0percent in August, the city receives 1,926 hours of bright sunshine annually. \nNanjing is endowed with rich natural resources, which include more than 40 kinds of minerals. Among them, iron and &lt;a href=\"sulfur\"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt; reserves make up 40\u00a0percent of those of Jiangsu province. Its reserves of &lt;a href=\"strontium\"&gt;strontium&lt;/a&gt; rank first in East Asia and the &lt;a href=\"South%20East%20Asia\"&gt;South East Asia&lt;/a&gt; region. Nanjing also possesses abundant water resources, both from the Yangtze River and groundwater. In addition, it has several natural hot springs such as Tangshan Hot Spring in &lt;a href=\"Jiangning%20District\"&gt;Jiangning&lt;/a&gt; and Tangquan Hot Spring in &lt;a href=\"Pukou\"&gt;Pukou&lt;/a&gt;.\nSun Yat-sen once summarized and lauded the feature of Nanjing in his book \"The International Development of China\" ():Nanking was the old capital of China before Peking, and is situated in a fine locality which comprises high mountains, deep water and a vast level plain\u2014a rare site to be found in any part of the world. It also lies at the center of a very rich country on both sides of the lower Yangtze. ()To be more exact, surrounded by the Yangtze River and mountains, the urban area of the city enjoys its scenic natural environment. Xuanwu Lake and Mochou Lake are located in the center of the city and are easily accessible to the public, while Purple Mountain is covered with deciduous and coniferous forests preserving various historical and cultural sites. Meanwhile, a Yangtze River deep-water channel is under construction to enable Nanjing to handle the navigation of 50,000 &lt;a href=\"Deadweight%20tonnage\"&gt;DWT&lt;/a&gt; vessels from the East China Sea.\nEnvironmental issues.\nAir pollution in 2013.\nA dense wave of smog began in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20China\"&gt;central&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20China\"&gt;east&lt;/a&gt; parts of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around , including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving &lt;a href=\"air%20mass\"&gt;air mass&lt;/a&gt;es carrying industrial emissions, collected &lt;a href=\"air%20pollution\"&gt;airborne pollutants&lt;/a&gt; to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its &lt;a href=\"air%20quality%20index\"&gt;AQI pollution Index&lt;/a&gt; at \"severely polluted\" for five straight days and \"heavily polluted\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic meter, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic meter on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00\u00a0pm, 3 December and 2:00\u00a0pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33\u00a0percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered &lt;a href=\"district%20heating\"&gt;district heating&lt;/a&gt; system in north China. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly &lt;a href=\"sulfur%20dioxide\"&gt;SO2&lt;/a&gt;) towards China's east coast.\nGovernment.\nAt present, the full name of the government of Nanjing is \"People's Government of Nanjing City\" and the city is under the one-party rule of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20China\"&gt;CPC&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"CPC%20Nanjing%20Committee%20Secretary\"&gt;CPC Nanjing Committee Secretary&lt;/a&gt; as the \"de facto\" governor of the city and the mayor as the executive head of the government working under the secretary.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe sub-provincial city of Nanjing is divided into 11 &lt;a href=\"District%20of%20China\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemographics.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20PRC%20census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt;, the total population of the City of Nanjing was 8.005\u00a0million. The &lt;a href=\"OECD\"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt; estimated the encompassing &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20area\"&gt;metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; at the time as 11.7\u00a0million. Official statistics in 2011 estimated the city's population to be 8.11\u00a0million. The &lt;a href=\"birth%20rate\"&gt;birth rate&lt;/a&gt; was 8.86\u00a0percent and the &lt;a href=\"death%20rate\"&gt;death rate&lt;/a&gt; was 6.88\u00a0percent. The urban area had a population of 6.47\u00a0million people. The &lt;a href=\"human%20sex%20ratio\"&gt;sex ratio&lt;/a&gt; of the city population was 107.31 males to 100 females.\nAs in most of eastern China, the official ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly &lt;a href=\"Han%20nationality\"&gt;Han nationality&lt;/a&gt; (98.56\u00a0percent), with 50 other &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20minorities%20in%20China\"&gt;official ethnic groups&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to officially defined minorities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were &lt;a href=\"Hui%20Chinese\"&gt;Hui&lt;/a&gt;, contributing 83.76\u00a0percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were &lt;a href=\"Manchu\"&gt;Manchu&lt;/a&gt; (2,311) and &lt;a href=\"Zhuang%20people\"&gt;Zhuang&lt;/a&gt; (533). Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13\u00a0percent of the district's population.\nEconomy.\nEarlier development.\nThere was a massive cultivating in the area of Nanjing from the Three Kingdoms period to Southern dynasties. The sparse population led to land as royal rewards were granted for rules\u2019 people. At first, the landless peasants benefited from it, then the senior officials and aristocratic families. Since large numbers of immigrants flooded into the area, reclamation was quite common in its remote parts, which promoted its agricultural development.\nThe craft industries, by contrast, had a faster growth. Especially the textiles section, there were about 200,000 craftsmen by the late Qing. Several dynasties established their imperial textiles bureaus in Nanjing. The Nanjing Brocade () is their exquisite product as the cloth for the royal garments such as &lt;a href=\"dragon%20robe\"&gt;dragon robe&lt;/a&gt;s. Meanwhile, the satins from Nanjing were called \"tribute satins\" (\"\"), because they were usually paid as tribute to the monarchy. Besides, minting, papermaking, shipbuilding grew initially since the Three Kingdoms period. As Nanjing was the capital of the Ming dynasty, the industries further expanded, where both state-owned and numerous private businesses served the imperial court. Several place names in Nanjing remains witnessed them, such as Wangjinshi (, the market sells &lt;a href=\"wangjin\"&gt;wangjin&lt;/a&gt;), Guyilang (, the corridor for garments bargain), Youfangqiao (, the bridge near an oil mill).\nMoreover, the trade in Nanjing was also flourishing. The Ming dynasty drawing \"Prosperous Nanjing\" () depicts a vivid market scene bustling with people and full of various sorts of shops. However, the economic developments were almost wiped out by the Taiping Rebellion's catastrophe.\nModern times.\nInto the first half of the twentieth century after the establishment of ROC, Nanjing gradually shifted from being a production hub towards being a heavy consumption city, mainly because of the rapid expansion of its wealthy population after Nanjing once again regained the political spotlight of China. A number of huge &lt;a href=\"department%20stores\"&gt;department stores&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Zhongyang%20Shangchang\"&gt;Zhongyang Shangchang&lt;/a&gt; sprouted up, attracting merchants from all over China to sell their products in Nanjing. In 1933, the revenue generated by the food and entertainment industry in the city exceeded the sum of the output of the manufacturing and agriculture industry. One third of the city population worked in the &lt;a href=\"service%20industry\"&gt;service industry&lt;/a&gt;, .\nIn the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned &lt;a href=\"heavy%20industry\"&gt;heavy industries&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production center of east China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From the 1960s to 1980s there were five pillar industries, namely, electronics, automobiles, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms.

Xu Xi's flower and bird paintings, Zhou Wenju, and Gu Hongzhong's figure paintings continue to pass. \"Han Xizai's Night Banquet\" is a masterpiece of ancient Chinese meticulous brushwork. The system of Nantang Painting Academy was also inherited by later generations. The Painting Book of Ten Bamboo Studios in the Ming Dynasty reproduced the paintings with the pinnacle of three-dimensional color printing techniques. The Painting Book of Mustard Seed Garden in the early Qing Dynasty was regarded as a must-read for learning Chinese painting. The \"Eight Masters of Nanjing\" headed by Gong Xian were active in Nanjing in the early Qing Dynasty and created the Jinling School of Painting.

Boating at night in the river was a main attraction of the city. Thus, one can see the statues of the famous teachers and educators of the past not too far from those of the courtesans who educated the young men in the other arts.\nIn the past 20\u00a0years, several commercial streets have been developed, hence the nightlife has become more diverse: there are shopping malls opening late in the &lt;a href=\"Xinjiekou%2C%20Nanjing\"&gt;Xinjiekou&lt;/a&gt; CBD, as well as in and around major residential areas throughout the city.
