The population was 3,439 at the 2010 census.\nHistory.\nMyrtle Creek was named for the groves of &lt;a href=\"Umbellularia\"&gt;Oregon myrtle&lt;/a&gt; (also known as California laurel), growing nearby. A Myrtle Creek post office was established in 1854 with Lazarus Wright as postmaster. In 1862, Wright sold the land for a town site to John Hall, who laid out Myrtle Creek in 1865.\nThe city has two covered bridges. The first, &lt;a href=\"Neal%20Lane%20Bridge\"&gt;Neal Lane Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, carries Neal Lane Road over &lt;a href=\"Myrtle%20Creek%20%28South%20Umpqua%20River%29\"&gt;South Myrtle Creek&lt;/a&gt; on the southeastern outskirts of the city. It was built in 1939. At long, it is one of the shortest covered bridges in Oregon and the only one with a &lt;a href=\"kingpost%20truss\"&gt;kingpost truss&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 1990, the City of Myrtle Creek acquired timbers from the former &lt;a href=\"Horse%20Creek%20Bridge%20%28McKenzie%20Bridge%2C%20Oregon%29\"&gt;Horse Creek Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lane%20County%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Lane County&lt;/a&gt; and used them to build another &lt;a href=\"covered%20bridge\"&gt;covered bridge&lt;/a&gt; over Myrtle Creek.

Two streams, North Myrtle Creek and South Myrtle Creek, merge at the city to form Myrtle Creek, a short tributary of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Umpqua%20River\"&gt;South Umpqua River&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of , all of it land.\nClimate.\nThis region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above .
