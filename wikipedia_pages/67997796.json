    "text": "Pic de Gerlache is a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"%20King%20Frederick%20VIII%20Land\"&gt; King Frederick VIII Land&lt;/a&gt;, NE &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;. Administratively it is part of the &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Greenland%20National%20Park\"&gt;Northeast Greenland National Park&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nThis nunatak was named in 1905 by the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Philippe%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans%20%281869%E2%80%931926%29\"&gt;Duke of Orl\u00e9ans&lt;/a&gt; during his &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans%20Arctic%20Expedition\"&gt;Arctic Expedition&lt;/a&gt; on ship &lt;a href=\"RV%20Belgica%20%281884%29\"&gt;Belgica&lt;/a&gt;, when he explored parts of the northeastern coast of Greenland. He named it after Belgian explorer &lt;a href=\"Adrien%20de%20Gerlache\"&gt;Adrien de Gerlache&lt;/a&gt; (1866\u20131934).\nAlthough this peak was an important landmark for the first explorers of the area, the 1906\u201308 &lt;a href=\"Danmark%20Expedition\"&gt;Danmark Expedition&lt;/a&gt; was unable to identify the original peak. Since the expedition members considered that the name should be preserved, it was placed on a conspicuous mountain rising on the north side of &lt;a href=\"Gammel%20Hellerup%20Glacier\"&gt;Gammel Hellerup Glacier&lt;/a&gt;.\nA few years later, &lt;a href=\"Ejnar%20Mikkelsen\"&gt;Ejnar Mikkelsen&lt;/a&gt; described this mountain as a &lt;a href=\"Pyramid%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;pyramid&lt;/a&gt; during the 1909-12 &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20Expedition\"&gt;Alabama Expedition&lt;/a&gt;: \nGeography.\nPic de Gerlache is located in Norre Biland, the northern section of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Orleans%20Land\"&gt;Duke of Orleans Land&lt;/a&gt;. It rises from a &lt;a href=\"nunatak\"&gt;nunatak&lt;/a&gt; a few kilometers inland in the central zone of &lt;a href=\"Jokel%20Bay\"&gt;Jokel Bay&lt;/a&gt;. On some maps the name is misplaced westwards to a slightly higher but less prominent nunatak peak."
