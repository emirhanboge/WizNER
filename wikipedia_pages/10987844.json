    "text": "The 1983 NSWRFL season was the 76th season of professional &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; football in Australia. Fourteen teams competed for the &lt;a href=\"J%20J%20Giltinan%20Shield\"&gt;J J Giltinan Shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winfield%20Cup\"&gt;Winfield Cup&lt;/a&gt; during the season, which culminated in a replay of the previous year's &lt;a href=\"grand%20final\"&gt;grand final&lt;/a&gt; between the Parramatta and Manly-Warringah clubs. During the season, NSWRFL teams also competed for the &lt;a href=\"1983%20KB%20Cup\"&gt;1983 KB Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\n1983 was the final season in the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League%20premiership\"&gt;New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership&lt;/a&gt; for Sydney-based foundation club &lt;a href=\"Newtown%20Jets\"&gt;Newtown Jets&lt;/a&gt;, and the first reduction in the number of teams in the competition since &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20University%20Rugby%20League%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Sydney University&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s departure at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1937%20NSWRFL%20season\"&gt;1937 NSWRFL season&lt;/a&gt;. It was also the first season that was played with four-point &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;tries&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason summary.\nFor the first time, the number of points awarded for scoring a try was raised from three to four. There was also the introduction of a handover if a team was caught in possession six times, which had the effect of killing the traditional &lt;a href=\"scrum%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;scrum&lt;/a&gt; but attracted many new followers to a game that had seen attendances decline by fifty percent since the record year of 1968. To counter a lucrative illegal &lt;a href=\"betting\"&gt;betting&lt;/a&gt; market, legal betting via &lt;a href=\"FootyTAB\"&gt;FootyTAB&lt;/a&gt; was introduced and was a regarded as a success.\nTwenty-six regular season rounds were played from February till August, resulting in a top five of Manly-Warringah, Parramatta, Canterbury-Bankstown, Balmain and St. George, who battled it out in the finals. &lt;a href=\"Manly-Warringah%20Sea%20Eagles\"&gt;Manly-Warringah&lt;/a&gt; managed 23 wins from 28 matches in 1983 \u2013 at the time the most wins in a season by a club in NSWRFL premiership history alongside &lt;a href=\"Parramatta%20Eels\"&gt;Parramatta&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s 23 in 1982.\nThe 1983 season's &lt;a href=\"Rothmans%20Medal\"&gt;Rothmans Medal&lt;/a&gt;list was Eastern Suburbs\u2019 back, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Eden\"&gt;Michael Eden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dally%20M%20Award\"&gt;Dally M Award&lt;/a&gt; went to Western Suburbs\u2019 half, &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Lamb\"&gt;Terry Lamb&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Rugby%20League%20Week\"&gt;Rugby League Week&lt;/a&gt;\" gave their player of the year award to Manly-Warringah winger, &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Sigsworth\"&gt;Phil Sigsworth&lt;/a&gt;. This season the Cocal-Cola Coach-of-the-year award was voted for by the coaches in the League and was awarded to rookie coach &lt;a href=\"Laurie%20Freier\"&gt;Laurie Freier&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis was also the last year in the first-grade competition for foundation club &lt;a href=\"Newtown%20Jets\"&gt;Newtown&lt;/a&gt;, who were dropped at the season\u2019s end.\nTeams.\nThe lineup of teams remained unchanged from the previous season, with fourteen clubs competing in total, including six &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;-based foundation teams, another six from Sydney, one from greater &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; and one from the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Capital%20Territory\"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt;. It was the last season for the Newtown club.\nFinals.\nGrand Final.\nParramatta powered over Manly for the second year straight to claim their third successive title. The 18-6 win saw Brett Kenny claim a unique achievement in scoring two tries in three successive grand finals. Kenny opened the scoring and the Eels raced to a 10-0 lead after 13 minutes when Eric Grothe steamrolled burly Manly fullback Graham Eadie.\nParramatta 18 (Tries: Brett Kenny 2, Eric Grothe; Goals: Cronin 3)\ndefeated\nManly-Warringah 6 (Tries: Phil Sigsworth; Goals: Graham Eadie)"
