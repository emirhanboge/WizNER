    "text": "Cumberland School of Law is an &lt;a href=\"American%20Bar%20Association\"&gt;ABA&lt;/a&gt; accredited &lt;a href=\"law%20school\"&gt;law school&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Samford%20University\"&gt;Samford University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Birmingham, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, United States. It was founded in 1847 at &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20University\"&gt;Cumberland University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lebanon%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Lebanon, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; and is the 11th oldest law school in the United States and has more than 11,000 graduates. Its alumni include two &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;United States Supreme Court Justices&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Peace%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; recipient &lt;a href=\"Cordell%20Hull\"&gt;Cordell Hull&lt;/a&gt;, \"the father of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;\"; over 50 U.S. representatives; and numerous senators, governors, and judges.\nThe school offers two degree programs: the 90-hour &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Doctor\"&gt;Juris Doctor&lt;/a&gt; (J.D.), and the &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Comparative%20Law\"&gt;Master of Comparative Law&lt;/a&gt; (M.C.L.), which is designed to educate foreign lawyers in the basic legal principles of the United States. The school also offers eight dual-degree programs and a Master of Laws (LL.M) program with concentrations in financial service regulatory compliance, health law and policy, higher education law and compliance, and legal project management.\nCumberland Law School is unrelated to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20Cumberlands\"&gt;University of the Cumberlands&lt;/a&gt; in Williamsburg, Kentucky, and is no longer a part of &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20University\"&gt;Cumberland University&lt;/a&gt; in Lebanon, Tennessee.\nHistory.\nThis summary is based on \"From Maverick to Mainstream\", a review of Cumberland's history and the development of the American legal education system.\nLangum and Walthall summarize the history of Cumberland Law School as:\nFrom its very local, Tennessee origins in 1847, Cumberland...emerged as a premier law school with a national status. It excelled in faculty, teaching methodology, and numbers of students. Following the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, Cumberland rebuilt itself and ultimately succeeded on a grand scale with its single-year curriculum.\nEarly years and founding.\nCumberland School of Law was founded on July 29, 1847 in Lebanon, &lt;a href=\"Tennessee\"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20University\"&gt;Cumberland University&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of 1847, there were 15 law schools in the United States.\n Prior to the law school's official founding, &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20University\"&gt;Cumberland University&lt;/a&gt; facilitated the study of law and admitted a diverse student body, evidenced by graduates such as &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Harkins\"&gt;George W. Harkins&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Choctaw\"&gt;Choctaw&lt;/a&gt; chief, who received a law degree from Cumberland and became a judge in 1834. \nAntebellum years.\nPrior to the founding of the United States' first law schools, the primary means for a legal education was &lt;a href=\"apprenticeship\"&gt;apprenticeship&lt;/a&gt;. Establishing law schools was difficult in the early 19th century. Harvard was only able to reestablish its law school in 1829 and &lt;a href=\"Yale\"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt; in 1826. By 1859 Cumberland, &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Law%20School\"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;University of Virginia School of Law&lt;/a&gt; were the three largest law schools in the United States. A year later, 1860, only 21 university law schools existed in the country, and, in no school did the curriculum extend beyond two years.\nDuring the Antebellum years, Cumberland enjoyed success. &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Green%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Nathan Green, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, son of then professor Nathan Green, Sr., stated that Cumberland enjoyed \"the highest degree of prosperity\", with a beautiful campus, picturesque trees and fences, and fine architecture. Cumberland's first graduate &lt;a href=\"Paine%20Page%20Prim\"&gt;Paine Page Prim&lt;/a&gt; ultimately became chief justice of the &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;Oregon Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;.\nStudents were taught through reading treatises, approximately two hours worth of recitations each morning, and a mandatory moot court program. Caruthers considered the law a science and the &lt;a href=\"Socratic%20Method\"&gt;Socratic Method&lt;/a&gt; a necessity. The cost was $50 a session and a $5 \"contingent fee\". After the Civil War, this treatise method, the legal formalism of the school's approach, and Nathan Green Jr.'s unwillingness to make changes, were all considered reasons for Cumberland's drift out of the mainstream.\nCivil war.\nAt the start of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the campus split within a week; some students joined the northern army; many joined the southern. Nathan Green Jr.'s father, a law professor, went home, but in fear of arrest, Abraham Caruthers fled to &lt;a href=\"Marietta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Marietta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, where he died a year later.\nDuring the war, professors John Carter and Nathan Green, Jr. fought as Confederate officers. Carter was killed, but Green survived. The campus did not. The trees were cut down and fences destroyed and burned. The Confederate Army burned the University buildings, apparently because a Confederate major was offended that Black Union soldiers had used them as barracks.\nReconstruction.\nThe law school began the slow process of rebuilding. In July 1866, Cumberland adopted the image of the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, the mythological Egyptian bird that is reborn from its own ashes. The new motto was \"&lt;a href=\"E%20Cineribus%20Resurgo\"&gt;E Cineribus Resurgo&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"I rise from the ashes.\"\nIn September 1865 classes resumed with 11 students, which soon grew to 20. The 1865 class included a Confederate General and Union colonel, enemies only a few months earlier. Nathan Green, Jr. kept the school together until Henry Cooper, a circuit judge, Andrew B. Martin, and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20L.%20Caruthers\"&gt;Robert L. Caruthers&lt;/a&gt;, brother of deceased founder Abraham Caruthers, joined the faculty. Robert Caruthers had previously served as the state attorney general and had been elected Governor of Tennessee during the war in 1863, but was never inaugurated.\nIn 1873 Robert Caruthers purchased Corona Hall from the Corona Institute for Women for $10,000, which he immediately donated to the University for use by the law school.\nThe destruction of the campus and the devastation of war had impoverished the school, and it was almost 15 years before it saw students enter from outside the South, when a student from Illinois and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Choctaw%20Nation%20of%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Choctaw Nation&lt;/a&gt; enrolled at Cumberland. But there were few students from outside of the defeated Southern states, which Langum and Walthall claim underscored \"how terribly the Civil War blighted Cumberland.\"\nRobert Caruthers persisted, despite the setbacks, and in 1878 Caruthers Hall was dedicated in his honor. This new school replaced Corona Hall, which had limitations. The new hall apparently had \"excellent acoustics and hard seats\" and is described as a:\nsplendid structure, built after the latest architectural style, is nearly one hundred feet from base to spire, and contains two recitation rooms for the Law Department, two Society Halls, a Library, and a chapel whose seating capacity is about seven hundred.\nNational shift in legal education.\nDespite the heroic efforts to keep the school alive, Cumberland was falling into the minority at the turn of the 20th century. It maintained a one-year curriculum when other schools moved toward longer terms, and it was entrenched with &lt;a href=\"legal%20formalism\"&gt;legal formalism&lt;/a&gt;, which had reached its peak in the 1870s and would soon be on the decline. In 1876, for instance, &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Law%20School\"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt; began to encourage a three-year curriculum. Through 1919, Cumberland did not adapt to the shift in legal education.\nHistorian Lewis L. Laska observed that:\nCumberland, which had once marked the high point of professional education, had become a captive of its own success. Unwilling to adopt modern techniques such as the &lt;a href=\"case%20method\"&gt;case method&lt;/a&gt;, or to expand and deepen its curriculum by opting for the three-year standard, Cumberland became the symbol of the democratic bar.\nIn 1903 Nathan Green, Jr. became the first dean of the law school. For the prior 57 years the school did not have this position, which was becoming more and more popular among law schools.\nCumberland first admitted women in 1901, and the library grew from 600 volumes in 1869 to 3000 in 1878. Today, the Lucille Stewart Beeson Law Library contains 300,000 volumes and microform volume equivalents.\nIn 1915 Cumberland refurbished its halls with an $8000 grant from the U.S. government as reparation for federal occupancy during the Civil War.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Cordell%20Hull\"&gt;Cordell Hull&lt;/a&gt; graduated from Cumberland, he commented on the diploma privilege, which granted the right to practice law without taking a &lt;a href=\"bar%20exam\"&gt;bar exam&lt;/a&gt;, saying that\naccording to custom, we members of the graduating class, the moment we received our diplomas, took them to the courthouse, where a district judge awaited us. He swore us in as members of the bar. I was not 20 years old.\nCordell Hull is today honored at Cumberland with a &lt;a href=\"Moot%20Court\"&gt;Moot Court&lt;/a&gt; room bearing his name.\nCumberland eventually did adapt to the changing times, moving from &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20University\"&gt;Cumberland University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lebanon%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Lebanon, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Samford%20University\"&gt;Samford University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Birmingham, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; in 1961. It is one of a few law schools in the United States to have been sold from one university to another (others include the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Puget%20Sound\"&gt;University of Puget Sound&lt;/a&gt; selling its law school to &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20University\"&gt;Seattle University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Quinnipiac%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Quinnipiac University School of Law&lt;/a&gt;, formerly part of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Bridgeport\"&gt;University of Bridgeport&lt;/a&gt;).\nPlanning.\nIn December 2005 Cumberland adopted a long-term plan for the school. One call of the plan is to gradually downsize the number of students in order to provide smaller classes and closer individual attention to students. In 1995 the entering class was 212 and by 2007 that number had been reduced to 159.\nToday the law school is known for its emphasis on trial advocacy and is building a biotechnology emphasis through its &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20School%20of%20Law%27s%20Center%20for%20Biotechnology%2C%20Law%2C%20and%20Ethics\"&gt;Biotechnology Center&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstitution.\nThe law school emphasizes practical skills and integrity. The former &lt;a href=\"dean%20%28education%29\"&gt;dean&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"federal%20judge\"&gt;federal judge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20L.%20Carroll\"&gt;John L. Carroll&lt;/a&gt; (class of '74) has stated that:\nThe prevailing philosophy is simple: Practical skill outweighs raw knowledge, and application transcends erudition. If the goal were to produce great law students, the tenets might be exactly the opposite. Our goal is to produce exceptional lawyers. That's why Cumberland\u2019s curriculum emphasizes the core competencies of legal practice: research, writing and persuasion.\nCurriculum.\nThe first year required classes are: &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Procedure\"&gt;Civil Procedure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Contracts\"&gt;Contracts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Property%20%28law%29\"&gt;Property&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Torts\"&gt;Torts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Criminal%20Law\"&gt;Criminal Law&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Evidence%20%28law%29\"&gt;Evidence&lt;/a&gt;. Students are divided into one of three sections, where the students remain together in their respective classes for the entire first year. First-year students are also enrolled in smaller sections for Lawyering and Legal Reasoning, a class that focuses on honing the students' ability to think and write like a lawyer.\nSecond- and third-year courses allow students more choices and some degree of specialization. Cumberland offers a balance of traditional courses, such as Criminal Procedure, Family Law, and Basic Federal Income Tax, and practical courses, such as Basic and Advanced Trial Skills, Business Drafting, Real Estate Transactions, and Law Office Practice and Management.\nStudents must also take Professional Responsibility and the &lt;a href=\"MPRE\"&gt;MPRE&lt;/a&gt;, an exam that is required to practice in addition to the bar exam.\nStudents are taught using the &lt;a href=\"Socratic%20Method\"&gt;Socratic Method&lt;/a&gt;, typical of law school pedagogy.\nThe Lucille Stewart Beeson Law Library.\nThe library building is with 13 conference rooms, 474 study spaces, carrels equipped with electrical and data connections, and three computer labs.\nThe collection consists of approximately 300,000 volumes and microform volume equivalents. The library also offers electronic and audiovisual resources. There are seven full-time librarians, eight full-time support staff members, and four part-time support staff members.\nThe Center for Biotechnology, Law, and Ethics.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20School%20of%20Law%27s%20Center%20for%20Biotechnology%2C%20Law%2C%20and%20Ethics\"&gt;Center for Biotechnology, Law and Ethics&lt;/a&gt; focus is on the research and study of the ethical and legal issues arising from the &lt;a href=\"biotechnology\"&gt;biotechnology&lt;/a&gt; industry, which is important to the City of Birmingham. Each year the Center sponsors a major symposium which attracts nationally known experts.\nThe 2007 Symposium, entitled \"The United States Health-Care System: Access, Equity and Efficiency\", focused on the issues of health care delivery in the United States, particularly to the poor, the problems that exist and potential solutions to those problems. The symposium brought together experts from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Minnesota\"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Louis%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Saint Louis University School of Law&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Texas%20A%20%26amp%3B%20M%20University\"&gt;Texas A &amp; M University&lt;/a&gt; and Cumberland.\nThe keynote address, which was also the &lt;a href=\"Thurgood%20Marshall\"&gt;Thurgood Marshall&lt;/a&gt; Lecture, was presented by &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congressman\"&gt;United States Congressman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Artur%20Davis\"&gt;Artur Davis&lt;/a&gt;, a leader on issues relating to the delivery of health care services.\nOther research centers include the Center for Law &amp; Church, and the Alabama Center for Law and &lt;a href=\"Civics\"&gt;Civic&lt;/a&gt; Education \nAdmissions statistics.\nThe Fall 2018 entering class consisted of 150 students with an average &lt;a href=\"Law%20School%20Admission%20Test\"&gt;LSAT&lt;/a&gt; of 151 and average &lt;a href=\"Grade%20Point%20Average\"&gt;GPA&lt;/a&gt; of 3.23. The top 75th percentile of the class has an LSAT of 154 and 3.61 GPA. The median age is 24, and the group is 51% male and 49% female. The minority percentage is 17.4%, with 9.3% of those students identifying as African American.\nEmployment.\nAccording to Samford's official 2013 ABA-required disclosures, 57.8% of the Class of 2013 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. Samford's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 30.5%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2013 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.\nCosts.\nThe total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Samford for the 2013\u20132014 academic year is $56,492. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $214,268.\nOrganizations.\nSelected student organizations.\nIn 2007, student teams from Cumberland won both the Criminal Justice Trial Competition held in &lt;a href=\"Hamden%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Hamden, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; and the Lone Star Classic Mock Trial Competition in &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas\"&gt;San Antonio, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2008, Cumberland placed first out of 256 other teams in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20for%20Justice\"&gt;American Association for Justice&lt;/a&gt; National Student Trial Advocacy Competition and in 2009 placed second, losing by one point. The same year, Cumberland made the finals of the ABA National Appellate Advocacy competition. It was one of four from 30 teams in its region that went to the national finals in Chicago. Cumberland won third best brief in the region.\nIn 2009, a Cumberland team won the regional round of the National Trial Competition in Tallahassee, Florida, advancing to the national championship round in San Antonio. Cumberland was the only school in the competition to have both of its teams advance to the semi-final round. Cumberland also won the &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20for%20Justice\"&gt;American Association for Justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mock%20Trial\"&gt;Mock Trial&lt;/a&gt; Competition regional championship advancing to the national championship round in West Palm Beach, FL.\nStudent life.\nCumberland offers numerous extracurricular activities.\nHousing for law students is not available on campus, but students typically rent apartments or buy houses in the surrounding community.\nRankings.\nIn 2005, 2006 and 2007 the \"&lt;a href=\"Princeton%20Review\"&gt;Princeton Review&lt;/a&gt;\" included Cumberland in its \"Best 170 Law Schools\", ranking it in two top-10 lists for three years in a row. In 2009, US News ranked Cumberland's Trial Advocacy Program ninth in the nation. In 2007 Cumberland ranked sixth for faculty performance and accessibility and seventh for overall quality of life. \"&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report\"&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;\" in its 2020 ranking places Cumberland at #146-192 in Best Law Schools."
