    "text": "Stirlingia simplex is a plant endemic to &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nA &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;y &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt;, \"S.\u00a0simplex\" can grow as a &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt; or as &lt;a href=\"Sucker%20%28botany%29\"&gt;suckering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt; with short-lived stems arising from a perennial rootstock. Stems may be up to ten centimetres long, and the plant as a whole grows to a height of from ten to 60 centimetres, rarely to one metre. It has soft leaves that bifurcate repeatedly into lobes, with the final lobes measuring from two to twenty millimetres long. Flowers are cream or yellow, and occur in dense heads from ten to 15 millimetres in diameter, atop &lt;a href=\"scape%20%28botany%29\"&gt;scape&lt;/a&gt;s up to 60 centimetres tall.\nTaxonomy.\nThe species was first published by &lt;a href=\"John%20Lindley\"&gt;John Lindley&lt;/a&gt; in his 1839 \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Sketch%20of%20the%20Vegetation%20of%20the%20Swan%20River%20Colony\"&gt;A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony&lt;/a&gt;\", based on unspecified material. Lindley commented that it \"resembles a &lt;a href=\"Sanicula\"&gt;Sanicula&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSince that time, it has had a fairly straightforward taxonomic history. It has only two synonyms:\nDistribution and habitat.\nIt occurs throughout much of the &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20Botanic%20Province\"&gt;Southwest Botanic Province&lt;/a&gt; of Western Australia, from &lt;a href=\"Eneabba%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Eneabba&lt;/a&gt; in the north, south to &lt;a href=\"Waroona%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Waroona&lt;/a&gt; and east to &lt;a href=\"Hyden%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Hyden&lt;/a&gt;. It grows in a variety of soils, amongst &lt;a href=\"Proteaceae\"&gt;proteaceous&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Myrtaceae\"&gt;myrtaceous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heath%20%28habitat%29\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"eucalypt%20woodland\"&gt;eucalypt woodland&lt;/a&gt;, and prefers seasonally wet areas.\nEcology.\nIt is not considered threatened."
