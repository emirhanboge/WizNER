Since 2013, she has been the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Meath%20and%20Kildare\"&gt;Bishop of Meath and Kildare&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Church of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. She was the first woman to become a bishop in the Church of Ireland and the &lt;a href=\"Ordination%20of%20women%20in%20the%20Anglican%20Communion\"&gt;first woman to be an Anglican&lt;/a&gt;bishop in &lt;a href=\"British%20Isles\"&gt;Ireland and Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education.\nStorey was born 30 March 1960. She was educated at the &lt;a href=\"Methodist%20College%20Belfast\"&gt;Methodist College Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"grammar%20school\"&gt;grammar school&lt;/a&gt; in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\nShe studied French and English at &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin\"&gt;Trinity College, Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1983; as per tradition, her BA was later promoted to a &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Arts%20%28Oxbridge%20and%20Dublin%29\"&gt;Master of Arts&lt;/a&gt; (MA Dubl) degree. In 1994, she began to train for ordination at the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Ireland%20Theological%20College\"&gt;Church of Ireland Theological College&lt;/a&gt;. She graduated in 1997 with a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Theology\"&gt;Bachelor of Theology&lt;/a&gt; (BTh) degree.\nOrdained ministry.\nStorey was ordained in the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Church of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"deacon\"&gt;deacon&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 and priest in 1998. From 1997 to 2000, she served her &lt;a href=\"Curate%23Anglican%20Communion\"&gt;curacy&lt;/a&gt; in the Parish of Kilconriola and Ballyclug, (&lt;a href=\"Ballymena\"&gt;Ballymena&lt;/a&gt;), County Antrim. From 2000 to 2004, she was an assistant curate at St Aidan's Church, &lt;a href=\"Glenavy\"&gt;Glenavy&lt;/a&gt;, County Antrim. In 2004, she was appointed &lt;a href=\"Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29\"&gt;rector&lt;/a&gt; of St Augustine's Church, &lt;a href=\"Derry\"&gt;Derry&lt;/a&gt;, County Londonderry.\nEpiscopal ministry.\nOn 19 September 2013, Storey was chosen by the House of Bishops to succeed &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Clarke%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;Richard Clarke&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Meath%20and%20Kildare\"&gt;Bishop of Meath and Kildare&lt;/a&gt;. She was consecrated to the episcopate at &lt;a href=\"Christ%20Church%20Cathedral%2C%20Dublin\"&gt;Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, on 30 November 2013. She is the first woman to be elected as a bishop in the Church of Ireland and the first woman to be an &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Communion\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; bishop in Ireland and Great Britain.\nAs Bishop of Meath and Kildare, she is the only Anglican bishop who is not also an &lt;a href=\"archbishop\"&gt;archbishop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Primate%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;primate&lt;/a&gt; to be styled \"&lt;a href=\"Most%20Reverend\"&gt;The Most Reverend&lt;/a&gt;\" (rather than \"&lt;a href=\"Right%20Reverend\"&gt;The Right Reverend&lt;/a&gt;\"), the style usually restricted to archbishops or primates.\nViews.\nStorey has described her &lt;a href=\"churchmanship\"&gt;churchmanship&lt;/a&gt; as \"&lt;a href=\"open%20evangelical\"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Christianity\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"evangelical\"&gt;evangelical&lt;/a&gt;\". She was previously a board member of the &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Alliance\"&gt;Evangelical Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. She voted 'no' on &lt;a href=\"Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20the%20Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;same-gender marriage in Ireland&lt;/a&gt; but, at the same time, affirmed &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Partnership%20and%20Certain%20Rights%20and%20Obligations%20of%20Cohabitants%20Act%202010\"&gt;civil unions and partnerships for same-gender couples&lt;/a&gt; thus taking a middle of the road approach. In her words, \"I believe that civil partnerships give gay people clear civil rights and recognition as people committed to one another, and I fully endorse this. ... However, I do not think this requires the redefinition of marriage to uphold it, and I do not believe marriage should be redefined.\".\nPersonal life.\nStorey is married to an Anglican priest, Earl Storey. Together they have two adult children; Luke and Carolyn."
