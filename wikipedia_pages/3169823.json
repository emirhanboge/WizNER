It passes by indorsement and delivery and transfers the absolute right to the goods described in it.\nIn &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in 1911, a dock warrant was liable to a &lt;a href=\"stamp%20duty\"&gt;stamp duty&lt;/a&gt; of threepence, which was denoted by an adhesive stamp, to be cancelled by the person by whom the instrument is executed or issued."
