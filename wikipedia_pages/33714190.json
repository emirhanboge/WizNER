    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Francisco Blake Mora (; 22 May 1966 \u2013 11 November 2011) was a &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20people\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; lawyer and politician who served as the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;Secretary of the Interior&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Felipe%20Calder%C3%B3n\"&gt;Felipe Calder\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; from 2010 to 2011. He was &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;'s top cabinet secretary and key figure in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"drug%20cartel\"&gt;drug cartel&lt;/a&gt;s and corruption in the country. Blake Mora was also an important official in the dialogues of Felipe Calder\u00f3n's drug policy, where he constantly traveled to meet with governors and victims of the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Drug%20War\"&gt;drug war&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education.\nBlake Mora was born in a working-class family in &lt;a href=\"Tijuana\"&gt;Tijuana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baja%20California\"&gt;Baja California&lt;/a&gt;. He obtained a degree in law from the &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20University%20of%20Baja%20California\"&gt;Autonomous University of Baja California&lt;/a&gt; (UABC) and a diploma in strategic planning and public policy from the &lt;a href=\"Instituto%20Tecnol%C3%B3gico%20Aut%C3%B3nomo%20de%20M%C3%A9xico\"&gt;Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; (ITAM).\nCareer.\nBlake Mora was elected to the office of Alderman of the City of Tijuana from 1995 to 1998, and later served as a federal deputy for the &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Federal%20Electoral%20District%20of%20Baja%20California\"&gt;Fifth Federal Electoral District of Baja California&lt;/a&gt; in the LVIII Legislature from 2000 to 2003. He then served as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Baja%20California\"&gt;Congress of Baja California&lt;/a&gt; from 2004 to 2007. According to \"&lt;a href=\"Fox%20News\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;\", Blake Mora gained popularity as a public official because he had promoted the cooperation of military forces and civil authorities to combat the drug cartels in his home state of Baja California before becoming Secretary of Interior.\nOn 1 November 2007, he was appointed Secretary General of the Government of Baja California by &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Baja%20California\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Guadalupe%20Osuna%20Mill%C3%A1n\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Osuna Mill\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;. In 2009, he was named as a possible candidate for the office of &lt;a href=\"Attorney%20General%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Attorney General of the Republic&lt;/a&gt;. On 14 July 2010, President &lt;a href=\"Felipe%20Calder%C3%B3n\"&gt;Felipe Calder\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; named him Secretary of the Interior to replace &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20G%C3%B3mez%20Mont\"&gt;Fernando G\u00f3mez Mont&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlake Mora promoted Felipe Calder\u00f3n's strategy of eradicating the &lt;a href=\"organized%20crime\"&gt;organized crime&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico and the notoriously corruption-plagued state and police forces. The British newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" described Blake Mora as Mexico's number-two official in fighting the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Drug%20War\"&gt;drug cartels&lt;/a&gt;, after the president. In addition, Blake Mora carried out the project for new national &lt;a href=\"Identity%20document\"&gt;identity card&lt;/a&gt; for underage people, with modern features that included digitalized fingerprints and iris images saved in government databases, which was intended to prevent criminals from using &lt;a href=\"Impostor\"&gt;false IDs&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nBlake Mora died in a helicopter accident along with seven other people in &lt;a href=\"Chalco%20de%20D%C3%ADaz%20Covarrubias\"&gt;Chalco de D\u00edaz Covarrubias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Estado%20de%20M%C3%A9xico\"&gt;Estado de M\u00e9xico&lt;/a&gt;, just outside &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;. There were no survivors. The helicopter, an &lt;a href=\"A%C3%A9rospatiale\"&gt;A\u00e9rospatiale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Super%20Puma\"&gt;Super Puma&lt;/a&gt;, was traveling to &lt;a href=\"Cuernavaca%2C%20Morelos\"&gt;Cuernavaca, Morelos&lt;/a&gt; for a meeting of prosecutors when it went down. &lt;a href=\"Marcelo%20Ebrard\"&gt;Marcelo Ebrard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Government%20of%20the%20Federal%20District\"&gt;Head of Government of the Federal District&lt;/a&gt;, said in an interview through \"&lt;a href=\"CNN%20en%20Espa%C3%B1ol\"&gt;CNN M\u00e9xico&lt;/a&gt;\" that the helicopter was \"completely destroyed,\" since it crashed head-on against a hill. Then, the helicopter impacted several times over the terrain as the pilot tried to land the aircraft safely.\nReports state that early in the morning before Blake Mora left &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;, the helicopter took a few minutes to take off due to dense &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt;, which has made observers speculate that visibility was a major factor of the collision. After the helicopter failed to arrive at the estimated time, aircraft were sent to investigate the situation, and eventually reported the damaged helicopter at 11:12\u00a0a.m. local time. Along with Blake Mora, the following people were killed in the accident: Felipe Zamora, general of legal affairs; Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Garc\u00eda Medina, director of social communications; Diana Hayton S\u00e1nchez, Blake Mora's secretary; Ren\u00e9 de Le\u00f3n Zapien, lieutenant general; Felipe Cort\u00e9s and Pedro Ram\u00f3n Escobar, both &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Air%20Force\"&gt;air force&lt;/a&gt; lieutenants; and Jorge Luis Ju\u00e1rez G\u00f3mez, army sergeant.\nAlthough not confirmed, some sources claimed that the President &lt;a href=\"Felipe%20Calder%C3%B3n\"&gt;Felipe Calder\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; had plans to travel in the helicopter that Blake Mora was killed in, and was awaiting the flight until the accident occurred. President Calder\u00f3n said that the helicopter was flying in foggy conditions, and that the crash \"was probably an accident.\" Investigations regarding his death were carried out immediately after the accident. The death of Blake Mora is the second loss in this position during the Calder\u00f3n presidency, the first one being &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Camilo%20Mouri%C3%B1o\"&gt;Juan Camilo Mouri\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt;, who died in a plane crash in 2008.\nBlake Mora's last &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; post before his death recalled the previous death of the former Secretary of Interior, Juan Camilo Mouri\u00f1o:\nControversy.\nThe question of whether this incident was a mere coincidence or a conspiracy has been discussed in numerous newspapers, blogs, and other internet sites. However, President Calder\u00f3n has tried to quell any suggestions of sabotage, saying Blake Mora's helicopter \"was always under guard\" in the hangar of Mexico's equivalent of the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20service\"&gt;Secret Service&lt;/a&gt; and that it had recently undergone maintenance. Before Blake Mora, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Camilo%20Mouri%C3%B1o\"&gt;Juan Camilo Mouri\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt;, who was also head of the Interior, was killed in an airplane accident on November 4, 2008 with the presidential security adviser &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Santiago%20Vasconcelos\"&gt;Jose Luis Vasconcelos&lt;/a&gt; and six other officials. And in September 21, 2005, &lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20Mart%C3%ADn%20Huerta\"&gt;Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00edn Huerta&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20Public%20Security%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;Public Security Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, also died in a helicopter accident with Jos\u00e9 Antonio Bernal, who worked for the &lt;a href=\"Human%20rights%20commission\"&gt;Human Rights Commission&lt;/a&gt;, Tom\u00e1s Valencia, head chief of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Police%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico, and six other officials. Although not proven, these high-profile deaths have fueled speculations on whether they were foul plays by the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Drug%20War\"&gt;drug cartels&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoreover, the death of Blake Mora and the seven others in a helicopter crash puts into relevance the fact that Mexico has no law or protocol that would prevent senior officials from flying in the same aircraft, as in other governments worldwide, to preserve the integrity of government and decision makers. Mexican law has no protocols to prevent the president or his cabinet, including members of the Legislature or the Judiciary, from travelling in the same vehicle for security reasons. In addition, &lt;a href=\"CNN%20en%20Espa%C3%B1ol\"&gt;CNN M\u00e9xico&lt;/a&gt; announced that soon after the death of Mexico's interior secretary, one &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; user posted on Blake Mora's page a day before his death caught the attention of the media. At the time of the plane crash, only 14 hours had passed since the tweet was posted. One individual under the username @Morf0 posted the following message on Blake Mora's Twitter page:\nNevertheless, the man that posted the Twitter message was interviewed through a phone call on live television, and claimed that his tweet was a prank among a community of internet surfers that were attempting to make predictions online. On another note, Hiram Fernando Escobar said his brother Pedro, co-pilot of the ship, told him two days before the incident that the helicopter was not ready to travel on Friday, the day he crashed in a mountainous area south of Mexico City. Pedro Escobar allegedly told his brother that the helicopter was \"not well\" and presented signs of failure. In addition, the helicopter, an &lt;a href=\"A%C3%A9rospatiale\"&gt;A\u00e9rospatiale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Super%20Puma\"&gt;Super Puma&lt;/a&gt;, was bought from a casino in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, and had been used for governmental purposes in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; since 1987. The controversy lies on the idea that the helicopter was \"out-of-date\" and that it was bought with a considerable amount of flight hours.\nInvestigations.\nAeronautic specialists from &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Eurocopter\"&gt;Eurocopter&lt;/a&gt;, are assisting the Mexican government investigate the helicopter accident that killed Blake Mora. President Calderon has solicited help from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board\"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt;, a U.S. agency specialized in aviation accidents, as well as &lt;a href=\"Bureau%20d%27Enqu%C3%AAtes%20et%20d%27Analyses%20pour%20la%20S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9%20de%20l%27Aviation%20Civile\"&gt;France's BEA&lt;/a&gt; to work together in the investigation regarding the secretary's death. Experts in the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Mexican Air Force&lt;/a&gt; will also be aiding in the investigations. After preliminary investigation and visual contacts of the accident, the wreckage did not show any damage caused by an explosion or fire, which has made investigators deduce that the collision was due to poor visibility. Investigations by the &lt;a href=\"Secretariat%20of%20Communications%20and%20Transportation%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;Secretariat of Communications and Transportation&lt;/a&gt; prove that the pilot of the helicopter did not lose control of the aircraft. Initial investigations show that the coordinates of where accident occurred coincide with the last record taken by the helicopter's radar. Moreover, government sources mention that the pilot of the helicopter took a different route in an attempt to escape the cloudiness and find a lower and more visible trajectory to their destination, but eventually wrecked in a hill known as \"Ayaqueme\", situated in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Chalco%20de%20D%C3%ADaz%20Covarrubias\"&gt;Chalco&lt;/a&gt;.\nForensic investigations and autopsies show that \"...all (the deaths) were (caused by) traumas,\" since the bodies came very complete, and doctors mention that the cause of death of all occupants of the helicopter was due to a very severe impact. Moreover, experts mention that if the helicopter had flown 200 feet (60 meters) higher or 300 meters further south, the helicopter would have not crashed. The reasons why the pilot decided to fly over 200 miles per hour against the mainland, without opening the landing gear, still remains a mystery.\nAftermath.\nAfter Blake's death, his functions as &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;Secretary of the Interior&lt;/a&gt; were temporarily assumed by the Secretary of Government, Juan Marcos Guti\u00e9rrez, while President &lt;a href=\"Felipe%20Calderon\"&gt;Calder\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; appoints a new secretary. Several academics and journalists from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Autonomous%20University%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;National Autonomous University of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Monterrey%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20and%20Higher%20Education\"&gt;Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Universidad%20Veracruzana\"&gt;Universidad Veracruzana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"CNN%20en%20Espa%C3%B1ol\"&gt;CNN M\u00e9xico&lt;/a&gt; have debated the possible impacts Blake Mora's death can have on Mexico's drug policy and politics. In addition, &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; has sponsored tweets on &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and forum discussions on &lt;a href=\"Facebook\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; through the program known as \"Mexico Opina\" to allow people to debate and analyze the causes and consequences of Blake Mora's death.\nFelipe Calder\u00f3n, the president of Mexico, named &lt;a href=\"Alejandro%20Poir%C3%A9%20Romero\"&gt;Alejandro Poir\u00e9 Romero&lt;/a&gt; as the new interior minister, six days after the previous head of the agency, Francisco Blake Mora, died on a helicopter accident.\nLegacy.\n&lt;a href=\"Felipe%20Calder%C3%B3n\"&gt;Felipe Calder\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; inaugurated a boulevard in &lt;a href=\"Tijuana%2C%20Baja%20California\"&gt;Tijuana, Baja California&lt;/a&gt; called \"Jos\u00e9 Francisco Blake Mora\" on 11 October 2012.\nPersonal life.\nAccording to information published by sources of &lt;a href=\"Baja%20California\"&gt;Baja California&lt;/a&gt;, Blake Mora used to go to &lt;a href=\"Mass%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;Mass&lt;/a&gt; every Sunday with his family and spend all day together, and share important dates, like Father's Day, with his loved ones. In addition, he used to spend quality time fishing, a hobby his father taught him when he was young."
