    "text": "Djelfa ( is the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Djelfa%20Province\"&gt;Djelfa Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Algeria\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt; and the site of ancient city and former bishopric Fallaba, which remains a Latin catholic &lt;a href=\"titular%20see\"&gt;titular see&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has a population of 339,248 (2008 census). The city lies at the junction of the N1 and the N46 roads.\nGeography.\nDjelfa is located at an elevation of 3,734 feet (1,138 m) in the &lt;a href=\"Ouled%20Na%C3%AFl%20Range\"&gt;Ouled Na\u00efl Range&lt;/a&gt; of north-central &lt;a href=\"Algeria\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, between the towns of &lt;a href=\"Bou%20Sa%C3%A2da\"&gt;Bousaada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Laghouat\"&gt;Laghouat&lt;/a&gt;. It is situated in a transitional zone between the dry, steppe-like &lt;a href=\"Hautes%20Plaines\"&gt;Hautes Plaines&lt;/a&gt; (high plateaus) of the north, characterized by &lt;a href=\"chott\"&gt;chott&lt;/a&gt;s (intermittent salt lakes), and the &lt;a href=\"Sahara\"&gt;Sahara&lt;/a&gt; to the south. The town was founded in 1852 as a French military post on a geometric plan. It serves as an important &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; market centre for the semi-&lt;a href=\"nomad\"&gt;nomad&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Ouled%20Na%C3%AFl\"&gt;Ouled Na\u00efl&lt;/a&gt; confederation. Djelfa is on the 12,000 mile-long Africa Trail.\nThe surrounding region for centuries has been the meeting place of the &lt;a href=\"Ouled%20Na%C3%AFl\"&gt;Ouled Na\u00efl&lt;/a&gt; people, who live in black-and-red striped tents and claim descent from the Islamic prophet, &lt;a href=\"Muhammad\"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe area is notable for its abundance of &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rock%20carving\"&gt;rock carving&lt;/a&gt;s dating from 7000 to 5000 BC. North of Djelfa town there is an imposing physical feature known as &lt;a href=\"Rocher%20de%20Sel\"&gt;Rocher de Sel&lt;/a&gt; (English: Salt Rock) that resulted from the erosion of rock salts and marls by rain. To the west of the town Megalithic funerary structures are found.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"civitas\"&gt;Roman town&lt;/a&gt; called Fallaba was built on the site of Djelfa. That town lasted unto &lt;a href=\"late%20antiquity\"&gt;late antiquity&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 11th century, the &lt;a href=\"Fatimid%20Caliphate\"&gt;Fatimids&lt;/a&gt; sent the &lt;a href=\"Banu%20Hilal\"&gt;Banu Hilal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Tripolitania\"&gt;Tripolitania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20Province\"&gt;Constantine&lt;/a&gt; areas against the &lt;a href=\"Zirid%20dynasty\"&gt;Zirids&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20P%C3%A9tain\"&gt;Philippe P\u00e9tain&lt;/a&gt;'s period, a concentration camp was placed in Djelfa.\nEcclesiastical history.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Vandal%20Kingdom\"&gt;Vandal Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; the town was the &lt;a href=\"cathedra\"&gt;seat&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;a href=\"classical%20antiquity\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bishopric\"&gt;bishopric&lt;/a&gt;. The bishopric was important enough in the Late &lt;a href=\"Roman%20province\"&gt;Roman province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Numidia\"&gt;Numidia&lt;/a&gt; to become one of the many &lt;a href=\"suffragan%20bishop\"&gt;suffragan bishop&lt;/a&gt;rics of its Metropolitan Archbishopric in &lt;a href=\"Carthage\"&gt;Carthage&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible that Christianity came to the town only after the rule of &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Constantine the Great&lt;/a&gt;, as there is no record of the bishopric under the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Romans&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe only known bishop of this African diocese is the Catholic bishop Salo mentioned in 484. This is considerably late compared to many of the other diocese in Numidia. Bishop Salo took part in the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Carthage%20%28484%29\"&gt;synod assembled in Carthage in 484&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Arianism\"&gt;Arian&lt;/a&gt; ruler, &lt;a href=\"Huneric\"&gt;Huneric&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vandal%20Kingdom\"&gt;Vandal Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;; after the Synod Salo was exiled (probably) to Vandal-controlled Sicily.\nLike most bishoprics in &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Africa\"&gt;Roman Africa&lt;/a&gt;, it faded after the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20the%20Maghreb\"&gt;Muslim conquest of the Maghreb&lt;/a&gt;.\nTitular see.\nIn 1933 the diocese was nominally restored as &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Latin Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"titular%20bishopric\"&gt;titular bishopric&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has had the following incumbents, mostly of the fitting episcopal (lowest) rank \"with an archiepiscopal (intermediary) exception :\nCulture.\nThe inhabitants are also &lt;a href=\"Ouled%20Na%C3%AFl\"&gt;Ouled Na\u00efl&lt;/a&gt; living in &lt;a href=\"Biskra\"&gt;Biskra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27Sila%2C%20Algeria\"&gt;M'Sila&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Saharan%20Atlas\"&gt;Saharan Atlas&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nDjelfa has a &lt;a href=\"semi-arid%20climate\"&gt;semi-arid climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; \"BSk\"), with more precipitation in winter than in summer. Snow is not unusual in winter."
