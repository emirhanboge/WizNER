    "text": "Nyhomes is New York State's affordable housing lender. Its mission is to expand affordable housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. \u201cnyhomes\u201d consists of three state agencies: the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Housing%20Finance%20Agency\"&gt;New York State Housing Finance Agency (HFA)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20New%20York%20Mortgage%20Agency\"&gt;State of New York Mortgage Agency (SONYMA)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Housing%20Finance%20Agency\"&gt;New York State Affordable Housing Corporation (AHC)&lt;/a&gt;.\nTogether, \u201cNyhomes\u201d finances single-family residential mortgages, multifamily lending housing programs and mortgage insurance for both single-family and multifamily housing. It also provides grants to local governments and not-for-profit organizations to subsidize the construction of new housing and renovation of existing housing for eligible New Yorkers.\nHFA and SONYMA are self-funded and do not rely on taxpayer funds. Both agencies issue tax-exempt &lt;a href=\"Bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt; to provide for their financing. AHC funds are appropriated as part of the State\u2019s annual budget. Funds for SONYMA\u2019s Mortgage Insurance Fund are generated from a portion of the state\u2019s mortgage recording tax surcharge."
