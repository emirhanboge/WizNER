    "text": "Lost Lettermen was a sports &lt;a href=\"weblog\"&gt;weblog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"database\"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched by Jim Weber in March 2009. It was dedicated to former college &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; players. It regularly interviewed former college stars such as &lt;a href=\"Tee%20Martin\"&gt;Tee Martin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Ward\"&gt;Charlie Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ki-Jana%20Carter\"&gt;Ki-Jana Carter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ed%20O%27Bannon\"&gt;Ed O'Bannon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corliss%20Williamson\"&gt;Corliss Williamson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mateen%20Cleaves\"&gt;Mateen Cleaves&lt;/a&gt;. It also had a database of over 150,000 former college athletes to answer the question, \"Where Are They Now?\"\nThe site was featured in \"&lt;a href=\"USA%20Today\"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;\" in March 2010 to locate the current whereabouts of &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship\"&gt;NCAA Tournament&lt;/a&gt; one-hit wonders such as &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Drew\"&gt;Bryce Drew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Pittsnogle\"&gt;Kevin Pittsnogle&lt;/a&gt;.\nJim Weber sold the site in 2015, and as of August 2017 it no longer was in operation."
