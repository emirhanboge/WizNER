In 1974, Clair was a correspondent for French media like &lt;a href=\"Radio%20France\"&gt;Radio France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Europe%201\"&gt;Europe 1&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the first French journalists to cover the war in &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; (1974\u20131975), with Gabriel Dardaud. Founder of the free radio Paris FM in 1981, which three years later became a subsidiary of Europe 1, Clair was appointed its co-director together with Robert Namias. Located in the &lt;a href=\"Montparnasse%20Tower\"&gt;Montparnasse Tower&lt;/a&gt;, Paris FM later changed its name to 95.2 FM, then Fun Radio Group, which is still in business.\nIn 1985, the prestigious French publication \"&lt;a href=\"Paris%20Match\"&gt;Paris Match&lt;/a&gt;\" delegated Clair as special envoy to the &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20Space%20Center\"&gt;Johnson Space Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Houston%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Houston, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, to observe the training of two CNES French spacemen, members of the first Franco-American shuttle crew. A senior writer for \"Paris Match\", Benoit was the first journalist allowed to join the shuttle crew members. He accompanied them 24 hours a day, for the entire training period until their departure for the launch pad at &lt;a href=\"Kennedy%20Space%20Center\"&gt;Cape Canaveral&lt;/a&gt;. A series of reports on the training was published in \"Paris Match\" in 1985 and 1986. \"Paris Match\" sold more than one million copies worldwide covering this major event. Benoit's first book, \"Aujourd'hui le soleil se l\u00e8ve 16 fois\" (\"Today, the Sun Rises 16 Times\"), was the outcome of this assignment and was published in September 1985 by Carr\u00e8re-Lafon. The book covers the space trip of &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Baudry\"&gt;Patrick Baudry&lt;/a&gt;, French payload specialist aboard &lt;a href=\"NASA\"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Discovery\"&gt;Space Shuttle Discovery&lt;/a&gt; mission STS-51-G. The book was followed by an audio CD produced by CBS France in January 1986. The series features the narration of the space trip, written by Clair, with voice-over by Michel Chevalet from TF1.\nLater, Clair was hired by &lt;a href=\"A%C3%A9rospatiale\"&gt;A\u00e9rospatiale&lt;/a&gt; as head of Communication of their &lt;a href=\"Ariane%205\"&gt;Ariane 5&lt;/a&gt;-Herm\u00e8s &lt;a href=\"space%20program\"&gt;space program&lt;/a&gt;.
