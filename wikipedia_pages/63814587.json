    "text": "The 2018\u201319 Denmark Series was the 54th season of the &lt;a href=\"Denmark%20Series\"&gt;Denmark Series&lt;/a&gt; which is a Danish football competition featuring amateur clubs. It is the fourth tier of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20Denmark\"&gt;Danish football league system&lt;/a&gt;. The competition is divided in four groups of ten teams each, based on geographical location. The winner of each group will be promoted to the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Danish%202nd%20Divisions\"&gt;2019\u201320 Danish 2nd Divisions&lt;/a&gt;. Relegation from the Denmark Series is wholly dependent on clubs relegating from the &lt;a href=\"Danish%202nd%20Division\"&gt;Danish 2nd Division&lt;/a&gt;; again, based on their geographical location. \nBecause four clubs from west of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Belt\"&gt;Great Belt&lt;/a&gt; relegated from the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Danish%202nd%20Divisions\"&gt;2018\u201319 Danish 2nd Divisions&lt;/a&gt;, and no teams east of the Great Belt, the 8th, 9th and 10th places of the West Groups (3 &amp; 4) faced direct relegation to the lower tiers. The two 7th places in the East Groups (1 &amp; 2) therefore face each other in direct play-off match for a place in the Denmark Series on a neutral ground. The overall winner remains in the Denmark Series.\nEast Groups.\nNo clubs from the East Groups relegated directly to the lower tiers, as four clubs west of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Belt\"&gt;Great Belt&lt;/a&gt; relegated from the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Danish%202nd%20Divisions\"&gt;2018\u201319 Danish 2nd Divisions&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Odder%20IGF\"&gt;Odder IGF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tarup-Paarup%20IF\"&gt;Tarup-Paarup IF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kjellerup%20IF\"&gt;Kjellerup IF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"BK%20Marienlyst\"&gt;BK Marienlyst&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Kastrup%20Boldklub\"&gt;Kastrup Boldklub&lt;/a&gt; became to only East Group club to relegate after a 3\u20130 loss to &lt;a href=\"Taastrup%20FC\"&gt;Taastrup FC&lt;/a&gt; in a direct play-off match for a place in the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Denmark%20Series\"&gt;2019\u201320 Denmark Series&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"TFC%20Odsherred\"&gt;TFC Odsherred&lt;/a&gt; disbanded following the season, saving &lt;a href=\"Kastrup%20Boldklub\"&gt;Kastrup Boldklub&lt;/a&gt; from direct relegation.\nGroup 1.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup 2.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nWest Groups.\nSix clubs relegated directly from the Denmark Series from the West Groups, as four clubs west of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Belt\"&gt;Great Belt&lt;/a&gt; relegated from the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Danish%202nd%20Divisions\"&gt;2018\u201319 Danish 2nd Divisions&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Odder%20IGF\"&gt;Odder IGF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tarup-Paarup%20IF\"&gt;Tarup-Paarup IF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kjellerup%20IF\"&gt;Kjellerup IF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"BK%20Marienlyst\"&gt;BK Marienlyst&lt;/a&gt;).\nGroup 3.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup 4.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRelegation play-offs.\nThere was no playoff match in the West Groups (Groups 3 &amp; 4) because &lt;a href=\"Skovshoved%20IF\"&gt;Skovshoved IF&lt;/a&gt; (east of the Great Belt) survived in the &lt;a href=\"Danish%202nd%20Division\"&gt;Danish 2nd Division&lt;/a&gt; and four west clubs relegated from the Danish 2nd Division.\nEast Region.\nThe East Region (Groups 1 &amp; 2) relegation play-off was played on 23 June 2019 at the &lt;a href=\"Glostrup%20Stadion\"&gt;Glostrup Stadion&lt;/a&gt;. The \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was &lt;a href=\"Taastrup%20FC\"&gt;Taastrup FC&lt;/a&gt;."
