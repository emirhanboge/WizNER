    "text": "Zeita () is a &lt;a href=\"Palestinian%20people\"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; town in the &lt;a href=\"Tulkarm%20Governorate\"&gt;Tulkarm Governorate&lt;/a&gt; in the western &lt;a href=\"West%20Bank\"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;, located 11 kilometers North-east of &lt;a href=\"Tulkarm\"&gt;Tulkarm&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href=\"Palestinian%20Central%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics\"&gt;Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, Zeita had a population of 2,852 inhabitants in 2007. 21.5% of the population of Zeita were refugees in 1997. The healthcare facilities for Zeita are designated as MOH level 2.\nHistory.\nZeita is an ancient village where marble &lt;a href=\"Corinthian%20order\"&gt;Corinthian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Capital%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;s have been reused in a local &lt;a href=\"Maqam%20%28shrine%29\"&gt;Maqam&lt;/a&gt;.\nPottery remains have been found here from the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt;, early &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; and the Middle Ages.\nIn 1265, Zeita was among the villages and estates sultan &lt;a href=\"Baibars\"&gt;Baibars&lt;/a&gt; allocated to his &lt;a href=\"amir\"&gt;amir&lt;/a&gt;s after he had expelled the &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20States\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt;. Half of Zaita was given to &lt;a href=\"emir\"&gt;emir&lt;/a&gt; \"Jamal al-Din Aidughdi al-'Azizi\", a quarter to emir \"Shams al-Din Ildikuz al-Karaki\", and a quarter to emir \"Saif al-Din Qilij al-Baghdadi\".\nOttoman era.\nThe village was incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; in 1517. In the 1596 Ottoman &lt;a href=\"Defter\"&gt;tax records&lt;/a&gt;, it appeared under the name of Zaita, located in the &lt;a href=\"Nahiya\"&gt;Nahiya&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Qaqun\"&gt;Qaqun&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Nablus%20Sanjak\"&gt;Nablus Sanjak&lt;/a&gt;. It had a population of 91 &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; and 7 &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; households. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues and a press for olive oil or grape syrup and a tax on people in the Nablus area; a total of 3,440 &lt;a href=\"ak%C3%A7e\"&gt;ak\u00e7e&lt;/a&gt;. Pottery remains from the Ottoman era have also been found here.\nZeita appears on sheet 45 &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Jacotin\"&gt;Jacotin's&lt;/a&gt; map drawn-up during &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"French%20campaign%20in%20Egypt%20and%20Syria\"&gt;invasion in 1799&lt;/a&gt;, though its position is not accurate. \nDuring the 1834 &lt;a href=\"Peasants%27%20revolt%20in%20Palestine\"&gt;Peasants' revolt in Palestine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20Pasha%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt&lt;/a&gt; pursued rebels to Zeita. Ninety rebels were slain here, while the rest fled to nearby &lt;a href=\"Deir%20al-Ghusun\"&gt;Deir al-Ghusun&lt;/a&gt;. At Deir al-Ghusun, many of the inhabitants and rebels heeded a call by &lt;a href=\"Husayn%20Abd%20al-Hadi\"&gt;Husayn Abd al-Hadi&lt;/a&gt; to flee once the Egyptian troops arrived. In response, rebel commander &lt;a href=\"Qasim%20al-Ahmad\"&gt;Qasim&lt;/a&gt; had several of the defectors among his ranks killed. Ibrahim Pasha's troops stormed the hill and the rebels (mostly members of the Qasim, &lt;a href=\"Jarrar%20clan\"&gt;Jarrar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jayyusi%20clan\"&gt;Jayyusi&lt;/a&gt; and Barqawi clans) were routed, suffering 300 fatalities. In 1838 it was noted as a village, Zeita, in the western \"Esh-Sha'rawiyeh\" administrative region, north of &lt;a href=\"Nablus\"&gt;Nablus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1870 &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Gu%C3%A9rin\"&gt;Victor Gu\u00e9rin&lt;/a&gt; found here a village with 600 inhabitants. He further noted: \"Here I found, just as at &lt;a href=\"Jatt%2C%20Israel\"&gt;Jett&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Capital%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; hollowed out to make a &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20and%20pestle\"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt;, and used for the same purpose. A very good &lt;a href=\"Water%20well\"&gt;well&lt;/a&gt;, constructed of cut stone, seems ancient.\"\nIn 1882, the &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20Exploration%20Fund\"&gt;PEF&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"PEF%20Survey%20of%20Palestine\"&gt;Survey of Western Palestine&lt;/a&gt;\" (SWP) described it as: \"a good-sized village on high ground at the edge of the plain. It is surrounded with fig-gardens, and has olives to the south. It would appear to be an ancient place, having tombs to the east. The supply is principally from wells, but there is a small spring ('Ain esh Shabutbut) on the south-west. [..] Two sacred places exist to the south side of the village.\"\nBritish Mandate era.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1922%20census%20of%20Palestine\"&gt;1922 census of Palestine&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the &lt;a href=\"Mandatory%20Palestine\"&gt;British Mandate authorities&lt;/a&gt;, Zeita had a population of 1,087, all Muslims, increasing in the &lt;a href=\"1931%20census%20of%20Palestine\"&gt;1931 census&lt;/a&gt; to 1,165 persons, all Muslim, living in 237 houses.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Village%20Statistics%2C%201945\"&gt;1945 statistics&lt;/a&gt; the population of Zeita was 1,780 Muslims, with 6,410 &lt;a href=\"dunam\"&gt;dunam&lt;/a&gt;s of land according to an official land and population survey. 782 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 5,120 used for cereals, while 33 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\nJordanian era.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"1948%20Arab%E2%80%93Israeli%20War\"&gt;1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War&lt;/a&gt;, and after the &lt;a href=\"1949%20Armistice%20Agreements\"&gt;1949 Armistice Agreements&lt;/a&gt;, Zeita came under &lt;a href=\"Jordan\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;ian rule, together with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Bank\"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1961, the population was 1,814 persons.\nPost-1967.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Six-Day%20War\"&gt;Six-Day War&lt;/a&gt; in 1967, Zeita has been under &lt;a href=\"Israeli%20occupation%20of%20the%20West%20Bank\"&gt;Israeli occupation&lt;/a&gt;."
