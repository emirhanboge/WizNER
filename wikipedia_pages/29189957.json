He supported the &lt;a href=\"Cavalier\"&gt;Royalist&lt;/a&gt; cause during the &lt;a href=\"First%20English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;First English Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, his eldest son &lt;a href=\"John%20Trevanion\"&gt;John Trevanion&lt;/a&gt; being killed in 1643.\nPersonal details.\nCharles Trevanion was born around 1594, eldest son of Charles Trevanion (died 1601) of &lt;a href=\"Caerhays%20Castle\"&gt;Caerhays Castle&lt;/a&gt; and his wife Joan Wichalse ( 1568-1598). One of the largest landowners in &lt;a href=\"Cornwall\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;, his father controlled several seats in &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20England\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, served as &lt;a href=\"Vice-Admiral%20of%20Cornwall\"&gt;Vice-Admiral of Cornwall&lt;/a&gt; and was &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff%20of%20Cornwall\"&gt;High Sheriff of Cornwall&lt;/a&gt; in 1596. When he died in 1601, Trevanion inherited nearly 8,000 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s of land around the village of &lt;a href=\"St%20Michael%20Caerhays\"&gt;St Michael Caerhays&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime before 1613, he married Amia Mallet, daughter of Sir John Mallet of Enmore; they had two sons and a daughter, including &lt;a href=\"John%20Trevanion\"&gt;John Trevanion&lt;/a&gt; (1613-1643), who was killed in the &lt;a href=\"Storming%20of%20Bristol\"&gt;Storming of Bristol&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nTrevanion attended &lt;a href=\"Oriel%20College%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;Oriel College, Oxford&lt;/a&gt; in 1611 and became a local &lt;a href=\"Justice%20of%20the%20Peace\"&gt;Justice of the Peace&lt;/a&gt; in 1617. Elected for &lt;a href=\"Cornwall%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Useless%20Parliament\"&gt;1625&lt;/a&gt;, he did not stand again but his extensive estates gave him influence over the Parliamentary seats of &lt;a href=\"Grampound%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Grampound&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tregony%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Tregony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St%20Mawes%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;St Mawes&lt;/a&gt;. This fact made him a substantial player in Cornish politics for the next thirty years.\nAlthough Trevanion supported the Parliamentary opposition in the debate over the &lt;a href=\"Petition%20of%20Right\"&gt;Petition of Right&lt;/a&gt;, his son John was one of 59 MPs named as \"betrayers of their country\" in May 1641 for voting against the &lt;a href=\"Bill%20of%20Attainder\"&gt;Bill of Attainder&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Wentworth%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Strafford\"&gt;Strafford&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"First%20English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;First English Civil War&lt;/a&gt; began in August 1642, "
