Another version of the oral history, which seems more reliable, indicates that the land-grant occurred a few centuries later, when the faction of the younger of two quarreling princes arrived in the vicinity of the \u1eccba'l\u00fam\u1ecd\u0300's \u00ccs\u00e8d\u00f3 kingdom, from the schism at their old kingdom at \u00ccl\u00e1 Y\u00e0r\u00e0. Arutu Oluokun, the younger of the feuding princes, founded a settlement at the &lt;a href=\"Ila%2C%20Nigeria\"&gt;Ila-Magbon&lt;/a&gt;, but the new kingdom moved within a short time to found another city called &lt;a href=\"Ila%2C%20Nigeria\"&gt;Ila-Odo&lt;/a&gt; closer to Isedo, which subsists as the modern \u00ccl\u00e1 \u00d2r\u00e0ng\u00fan.\nConsolidation and accommodation.\nAn annual celebration called \"\u00ccm\u00e1r\u00fagb\u00f3\" (or \"\u00d2k\u00f9nr\u00ecn\") festival was instituted between the two city-states during which the King \u1ecc\u0300r\u00e0ng\u00fan leaves his palace with his chiefs to pay a day-long homage to his primogenitor, the King \u1eccba'l\u00fam\u1ecd\u0300 in his (the \u1eccba'l\u00fam\u1ecd\u0300's) palace. This is in symbolic tribute to \u1eccba'l\u00fam\u1ecd\u0300's land grant and precedence of him in the region, in appreciation of \u1eccba'l\u00fam\u1ecd\u0300's hosting of the \u00d2r\u00e0ng\u00fan's elderly mother who could not continue with the immigrant party to the location of their allocated land. The \u1ecc\u0300r\u00e0ng\u00fan's mother died in the palace of the \u1eccba'l\u00fam\u1ecd\u0300 and was buried at \u00ccs\u00e8d\u00f3. So the \u1ecc\u0300r\u00e0ng\u00fan also visits her grave as part of this festival.\nWhile it has maintained the royal title of Oba'l\u00fam\u00f2, the kingdom of \u00ccs\u1eb9\u0300d\u00f3 has in modern times been virtually engulfed by the present-day &lt;a href=\"Ila%2C%20Nigeria\"&gt;Ila O\u0323rangun&lt;/a&gt; such that the old Isedo township now lies (at ), in the southeast quadrant of Ila Orangun. In Oke-Ila, the &lt;a href=\"orature\"&gt;orature&lt;/a&gt;s of the \u1eccba\u00e1l\u00e1 clan refer to their origin from \u00ccs\u00e8d\u00f3, indicating that they are actually a segment of the \u00ccs\u1eb9\u0300d\u00f3 royalty which emigrated several centuries ago to an alliance with Apakiimo, the last Orangun at &lt;a href=\"Ila%20Yara\"&gt;Ila Yara&lt;/a&gt; kingdom to found his (Orangun's) new kingdom now known as &lt;a href=\"Oke-Ila\"&gt;Oke-Ila&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this five-centuries-old quasi-consolidation treaty to help found with the new &lt;a href=\"Oke-Ila\"&gt;Oke-Ila&lt;/a&gt; Orangun state, the \u00ccs\u1eb9\u0300d\u00f3 immigrants \"of the hilltop\" (Isedo Oke or Isedo Ori Oke)were retained their royal title of \u1eccba'l\u00fam\u1ecd\u0300, and subsequently were accorded a new recognition (possibly for their foremost contribution to the establishment of the new kingdom), awarding their clan the title of &lt;a href=\"Obaala\"&gt;O\u0323ba\u00e1l\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; (\"mighty king\" or \"senior king\"), a title next in rank to the &lt;a href=\"Orangun\"&gt;\u00d2\u0323r\u00e0ng\u00fan&lt;/a&gt; of Oke-Ila the paramount king. The \u1eccba\u00e1l\u00e1 is also designated as the automatic regent upon the demise of any reigning \u1ecc\u0300r\u00e0ng\u00fan.\nHeritage and diaspora.\nThe \u00ccs\u1eb9\u0300d\u00f3 &lt;a href=\"clans\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; retain references in their &lt;a href=\"orature\"&gt;orature&lt;/a&gt;s to their ancestry from \u00ccs\u1eb9\u0300d\u00f3 and the ancient \u1ecc\u0300b\u00e0 kingdom, and citing their descent from King \u1eccba'l\u00fam\u1ecd\u0300 of \u00ccs\u1eb9\u0300d\u00f3 and King &lt;a href=\"Olunlakin\"&gt;Olunlakin&lt;/a&gt; of \u1ecc\u0300b\u00e0 as well as nostalgically referring to themselves as \"children of the great wealth\" of \u1ecc\u0300b\u00e0.\nOther examples of Igbomina and non-Igbomina towns (in &lt;a href=\"Kwara%20State\"&gt;Kwara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Osun%20State\"&gt;O\u0323s\u0323un&lt;/a&gt; states of Nigeria) with large concentrations of \u1ecc\u0300b\u00e0 people, now commonly called 'The &lt;a href=\"Oba%2C%20Nigeria\"&gt;\u00d2\u0323b\u00e0&lt;/a&gt; Diaspora', include the following: &lt;a href=\"Oke-Ila\"&gt;Oke-Ila O\u0323rangun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ila%2C%20Nigeria\"&gt;Ila O\u0323rangun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Igbo-Ora\"&gt;O\u0323ra-Igbomina&lt;/a&gt;, Ipoti-Ekiti, Isanlu-Isin, &lt;a href=\"Oke-Onigbin\"&gt;Oke-Onigbin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20091202060259/http%3A//omuaran.net/\"&gt;Omu-Aran&lt;/a&gt;, Ror\u1eb9, \u1eccyan, Inisha, Ipee, Oke-Ode, Babanla, Ajas\u1eb9-Ipo, Omupo, Esi\u1eb9, Oro, Ijomu-Oro, Iddo-Oro, Idofin, Ado-Eku, Oreke, Sanmora, and Pamo.\nThe \u00ccs\u1eb9\u0300d\u00f3 &lt;a href=\"clans\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; appear to be the earliest surviving [but perhaps not the only] group in 'The &lt;a href=\"Oba%2C%20Nigeria\"&gt;\u00d2\u0323b\u00e0&lt;/a&gt; Diaspora' that purposefully set out and founded a surviving kingdom ruled by the king &lt;a href=\"Obalumo\"&gt;O\u0323ba'lumo\u0323&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent \u1ecc\u0300b\u00e0-derivative kingdoms and diasporas appear to have resulted solely from refugee flights from wars and slave raids. \u00ccs\u1eb9\u0300d\u00f3 communities resulting from the diaspora of such wars exist in &lt;a href=\"Ipoti\"&gt;Ipoti&lt;/a&gt;-Ekiti, and other &lt;a href=\"Igbomina\"&gt;Igbomina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ekiti%20State\"&gt;Ekiti&lt;/a&gt; towns as well as Omido (&lt;a href=\"Kwara%20State\"&gt;Kwara State&lt;/a&gt;) and other towns in Kwara State.\nIsedo and Oba diaspora tourism.\nThe legends of origin and of emigrations of the Isedo from Oba has been a major effort of &lt;a href=\"His%20Royal%20Highness\"&gt;His Royal Highness&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Ol\u00faf\u1eb9\u0301mi \u1eccl\u00e1d\u00e0p\u1ecd\u0300 Babal\u1ecdl\u00e1. He has also been active since 2004 in promoting &lt;a href=\"tourism\"&gt;tourism&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"heritage%20tourism\"&gt;heritage tourism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"cultural%20tourism\"&gt;cultural tourism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"geotourism\"&gt;geo-tourism&lt;/a&gt;), and planning tourist expeditions to the various Isedo and Oba heritage sites and physiographic features and cultural performances/traditional occupations of the Igbomina-Yoruba and adjoining Yoruba areas. He has led various special tours to the various old sites, &lt;a href=\"ruins\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; and existing towns and &lt;a href=\"historical\"&gt;historical&lt;/a&gt; places of &lt;a href=\"Yorubaland\"&gt;Yorubaland&lt;/a&gt;, especially of the Igbomina-Yoruba region, verifying &lt;a href=\"oral%20history\"&gt;oral history&lt;/a&gt; and oral poetry of various &lt;a href=\"clans\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; and ancient kingdoms."
