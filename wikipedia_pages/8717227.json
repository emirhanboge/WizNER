    "text": "Banksia acanthopoda is a species of &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt; in the family &lt;a href=\"Proteaceae\"&gt;Proteaceae&lt;/a&gt;. It grows as a small spreading shrub to high and has prickly leaves and yellow composite flower heads, called &lt;a href=\"inflorescence\"&gt;inflorescence&lt;/a&gt;s, composed of 50 to 60 individual yellow flowers. Flowering takes place in the southern hemisphere winter. Endemic to &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, it occurs only in a few populations in the vicinities of &lt;a href=\"Woodanilling%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Woodanilling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Katanning%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Katanning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkan%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Darkan&lt;/a&gt;. Because of its rarity, it is classed as \"Priority Two\" conservation flora by Western Australia's &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Conservation%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Department of Environment and Conservation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe botanist &lt;a href=\"Alex%20George\"&gt;Alex George&lt;/a&gt; first described this species in 1996, naming it Dryandra acanthopoda. It was renamed to its current name in 2007, when all \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra\"&gt;Dryandra&lt;/a&gt;\" species were transferred to the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia\"&gt;Banksia&lt;/a&gt;\". It is little known in cultivation and its sensitivity to &lt;a href=\"Phytophthora%20cinnamomi\"&gt;dieback&lt;/a&gt; is unclear (although highly likely). It has potential as a &lt;a href=\"cut%20flower\"&gt;cut flower&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Banksia acanthopoda\" grows as a spreading shrub up to high. Its stems are matted with short soft hairs when young, but these are soon lost. Leaves are long, thin and curved, with five to ten spines on the &lt;a href=\"Petiole%20%28botany%29\"&gt;petiole&lt;/a&gt;, sharply serrated &lt;a href=\"Leaf%23Margins%20.28edge.29\"&gt;leaf margins&lt;/a&gt;, and an acute leaf tip. The leaf blade, or lamina, is dark-green above, but white and hairy beneath. Leaves range from in length, and in width, on a petiole up to long.\n&lt;a href=\"Inflorescence\"&gt;Inflorescence&lt;/a&gt;s occur on short lateral branches, and consist of 50 to 60 yellow flowers packed densely together into a dome-shaped &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28botany%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; up to in diameter, surrounded by short &lt;a href=\"involucral%20bract\"&gt;involucral bract&lt;/a&gt;s. As with other \"Banksia\" species, each flower comprises a &lt;a href=\"perianth\"&gt;perianth&lt;/a&gt; of four united &lt;a href=\"tepal\"&gt;tepal&lt;/a&gt;s, with a single &lt;a href=\"anther\"&gt;anther&lt;/a&gt; on a short filament attached near the tip; and a single &lt;a href=\"Gynoecium%23Pistils\"&gt;pistil&lt;/a&gt;. In \"B.\u00a0acanthopoda\" both perianth and pistil are yellow in colour; the perianth is from long, and the pistil a few millimetres longer. The fruiting structure is a woody dome firmly embedded with up to six light brown &lt;a href=\"follicle%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;follicles&lt;/a&gt;, each containing one or two seeds.\n\"Banksia acanthopoda\" resembles \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia%20hewardiana\"&gt;B.\u00a0hewardiana&lt;/a&gt;\" but has smaller leaves that are sticky when young. Its flower heads are similar to that of \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia%20squarrosa\"&gt;B.\u00a0squarrosa&lt;/a&gt;\", but its perianths and pistils are straight rather than curved, and longer.\nTaxonomy.\nEarly collections of \"B.\u00a0acanthopoda\" include a specimen collected by &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Humphreys\"&gt;F. W. Humphreys&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Katanning%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Katanning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kwobrup%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Kwobrup&lt;/a&gt; on 21 December 1964, a specimen collected by &lt;a href=\"Alex%20George\"&gt;Alex George&lt;/a&gt; west of &lt;a href=\"Woodanilling%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Woodanilling&lt;/a&gt; on 26 July 1986, a specimen collected by Ray Garstone north of Woodanilling on 7 October 1986, and a specimen collected by &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Newbey\"&gt;Ken Newbey&lt;/a&gt; east of Katanning. George's specimen was recognised as belonging to an undescribed species, and this species was referred to by the &lt;a href=\"phrase%20name\"&gt;phrase name&lt;/a&gt; \"\"Dryandra\" sp.\u00a01 (A.S. George 16647)\", until 1996, when George formally published it as \"Dryandra acanthopoda\". The specific name is said to be derived from Greek \"acantha\", \"a thorn or prickle\" and \"podos\", \"a foot\", in reference to the spines on the petiole. The Greek word for \"foot\" is \"pous\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2).\nGeorge placed \"B.\u00a0acanthopoda\" in genus \"Dryandra\", &lt;a href=\"subgenus\"&gt;subgenus&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Dryandra%20subg.%20Dryandra\"&gt;Dryandra&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"series%20%28botany%29\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Dryandra%20ser.%20Armatae\"&gt;Armatae&lt;/a&gt;\", remarking that its closest relative is \"Dryandra polycephala\" (now \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia%20polycephala\"&gt;Banksia polycephala&lt;/a&gt;\"). Its placement within &lt;a href=\"George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Dryandra\"&gt;George's taxonomic arrangement of \"Dryandra\"&lt;/a&gt;, with 1999 and 2005 amendments, is as follows:\nThis arrangement remained current until 2007, when botanists &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Mast\"&gt;Austin Mast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Thiele\"&gt;Kevin Thiele&lt;/a&gt; transferred \"Dryandra\" into \"Banksia\". They also published &lt;a href=\"Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae\"&gt;\"B.\"\u00a0subgenus \"Spathulatae\"&lt;/a&gt; for the \"Banksia\" taxa having spoon-shaped &lt;a href=\"cotyledon\"&gt;cotyledon&lt;/a&gt;s, thus redefining the &lt;a href=\"Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia\"&gt;subgenus \"Banksia\"&lt;/a&gt; as comprising those that do not. They were not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing \"Dryandra\", so as an interim measure they transferred \"Dryandra\" into \"Banksia\" at &lt;a href=\"series%20%28botany%29\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, \"B.\u00a0acanthopoda\" is placed in &lt;a href=\"Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia\"&gt;\"B.\"\u00a0subg. \"Banksia\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra\"&gt;ser. \"Dryandra\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistribution and habitat.\nOnly a few small populations of \"B.\u00a0acanthopoda\" exist. Until 1999, it was thought to occur only in the &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Wheatbelt\"&gt;Avon Wheatbelt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biogeography\"&gt;biogeographic&lt;/a&gt; region, in the vicinity of Woodanilling and Katanning; since then, a population has been found in the &lt;a href=\"Jarrah%20Forest\"&gt;Jarrah Forest&lt;/a&gt; region, south of &lt;a href=\"Darkan%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Darkan&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Banksia acanthopoda\" grows in tall closed &lt;a href=\"kwongan\"&gt;kwongan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heath%20%28habitat%29\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"laterite\"&gt;lateritic&lt;/a&gt; soils, sometimes with a sparse overstorey of wandoo (\"&lt;a href=\"Eucalyptus%20wandoo\"&gt;Eucalyptus wandoo&lt;/a&gt;\") or Drummond's gum (\"&lt;a href=\"Eucalyptus%20drummondii\"&gt;E.\u00a0drummondii&lt;/a&gt;\"). Other \"B.\"\u00a0ser. \"Dryandra\" species that co-occur with it include \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia%20stuposa\"&gt;B.\u00a0stuposa&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Banksia%20armata%20var.%20ignicida\"&gt;\"B.\u00a0armata\" var. \"ignicida\"&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia%20nobilis\"&gt;B.\u00a0nobilis&lt;/a&gt;\". The area has a mean temperature range of , with up to 40 days above , and a mean annual rainfall of .\nEcology.\nLittle has been reported of its ecology. The flowering season is from May to July, and the seed is shed annually. When first published, \"Banksia acanthopoda\" was listed as \"Priority Three \u2013 Poorly Known Taxa\" on the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Conservation%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Department of Environment and Conservation&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Declared%20Rare%20and%20Priority%20Flora%20List\"&gt;Declared Rare and Priority Flora List&lt;/a&gt;. It has since been upgraded to \"Priority Two \u2013 Poorly Known Taxa\". Threats to the species vary according to the location. In the Avon Wheatbelt, where the land is heavily degraded due to extensive clearing for agriculture, a number of threatening processes have been identified: loss of habitat due to land clearing and the encroachment of &lt;a href=\"salinity%20in%20Australia\"&gt;salinity&lt;/a&gt; results in both direct plant loss and &lt;a href=\"population%20fragmentation\"&gt;population fragmentation&lt;/a&gt;; fragmentation in turn affects genetic diversity; &lt;a href=\"grazing%20pressure\"&gt;grazing pressure&lt;/a&gt; affects plant health, as does competition from exotic weeds; and changes to the &lt;a href=\"fire%20regime\"&gt;fire regime&lt;/a&gt; have the potential to eliminate entire generations. Further west, in the Jarrah Forest region, &lt;a href=\"pathogen\"&gt;pathogen&lt;/a&gt;s constitute the only identified threat to the species.\nInformation on the species' susceptibility to dieback is lacking: the only information available is from the 2006 report \"Management of \"Phytophthora cinnamomi\" for Biodiversity Conservation in Australia\", which states that \"D.\u00a0acanthopoda\" is \"highly susceptible\"; but this claim is sourced to a 1994 paper that asserts it not for \"B.\u00a0acanthopoda\" but for the species then known as \"\"Dryandra\" sp. Kamballup (M. Pieroni 20.9.88)\", now \"&lt;a href=\"Banksia%20ionthocarpa\"&gt;B.\u00a0ionthocarpa&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInvestigations into long-term seed storage have shown \"B.\u00a0acanthopoda\" to store well under standard &lt;a href=\"genebank\"&gt;genebank&lt;/a&gt; storage conditions. After six years of storage in these conditions, 90% of seeds were successfully germinated, a rate similar to that of fresh seed.\nCultivation.\n\"Banksia acanthopoda\" is little known in cultivation, although it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Barker%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Mount Barker, Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Cranbourne\"&gt;Royal Botanic Gardens&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cranbourne%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Cranbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the &lt;a href=\"floriculture\"&gt;cut flower industry&lt;/a&gt;. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent."
