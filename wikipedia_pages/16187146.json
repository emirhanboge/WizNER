    "text": "L'\u00c9tivaz is a hard Swiss cheese made from raw cow's milk named after the place of its origin. It is classified as a &lt;a href=\"Swiss-type%20cheeses\"&gt;Swiss-type or Alpine cheese&lt;/a&gt;, and is very similar to &lt;a href=\"Gruy%C3%A8re%20%28cheese%29\"&gt;Gruy\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt; surchoix in taste.\nL'Etivaz is a hamlet in the southwestern &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Alps\"&gt;Swiss Alps&lt;/a&gt;, just under the &lt;a href=\"Col%20des%20Mosses\"&gt;Col des Mosses&lt;/a&gt; in the canton of &lt;a href=\"Vaud\"&gt;Vaud&lt;/a&gt;. It has about 150 inhabitants. The cheese is made in the communes of &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau-d%27%C5%92x\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau-d'\u0152x&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rougemont%2C%20Switzerland\"&gt;Rougemont&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rossini%C3%A8re\"&gt;Rossini\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ormont-Dessous\"&gt;Ormont-Dessous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ormont-Dessus\"&gt;Ormont-Dessus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leysin\"&gt;Leysin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corbeyrier\"&gt;Corbeyrier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Villeneuve%2C%20Vaud\"&gt;Villeneuve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ollon\"&gt;Ollon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bex\"&gt;Bex&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn the 1930s, a group of 76 Gruy\u00e8re producing families felt that government regulations were allowing cheesemakers to compromise the qualities that made good Gruy\u00e8re so special. They withdrew from the government's Gruy\u00e8re program, and \"created\" their own cheese - L'Etivaz - named for the village around which they all lived. They founded a &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt; in 1932, and the first cheese cellars were built in 1934.\nFabrication.\nL'Etivaz is made essentially as &lt;a href=\"Gruy%C3%A8re%20%28cheese%29\"&gt;Gruy\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt; was 100 years ago. It is made only when the cows are doing their summer grazing in Alpine pastures. It must be made in traditional copper cauldrons, and only over old-style, open wood fires. The resulting cheese is a bit creamier and less sharp than Antique Gruy\u00e8re, yet smooth and flavorful. L'Etivaz has a firm texture with a fruity, slightly nutty flavor, which varies depending on the soil of the different pastures. It is yellow ivory in color and slightly sticky due to its saltiness. It is aged for 5 to 13 months before it is eaten.\nThe cheese is formed into a wheel, in diameter with a thickness of and weighing from . Originally, the cheese had a large distribution of tiny holes; however, the modern cheese rarely shows holes. One may see the occasional horizontal fissure under the rind. It is eaten at the end of a meal with raisins or fresh figs. Another excellent accompaniment is nuts and slices of pears.\nCertification.\nIn 2000, the cheese L'Etivaz was the first Swiss product other than wine to obtain an \"&lt;a href=\"appellation%20d%27origine%20contr%C3%B4l%C3%A9e\"&gt;appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;\" (AOC). In 2013, the certification was replaced by the \"&lt;a href=\"Appellation%20d%27origine%20prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9e%20%28Switzerland%29\"&gt;appellation d'origine prot\u00e9g\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;\" (AOP)."
