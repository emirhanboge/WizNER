He actually came to reconcile the differences between his father, Chandrasekhar Rao, and Balaraju. The pair parted ways as Chadrasekhar went to the UK while Balaraju stayed and built a charitable hospital for local people. Abhiram succeeds in winning over family members, and Balaraju understands the truth behind Abhiram and his attempts.\nThe film was officially announced in Hyderabad on 6 February 2014. &lt;a href=\"Principal%20photography\"&gt;Principal photography&lt;/a&gt; commenced from the same day and ended on 22 September 2014. A large portion of the film was shot in &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad\"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rameswaram\"&gt;Rameswaram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nagercoil\"&gt;Nagercoil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Konaseema\"&gt;Konaseema&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kanyakumari\"&gt;Kanyakumari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pollachi\"&gt;Pollachi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karaikudi\"&gt;Karaikudi&lt;/a&gt; in India while significant portions were shot in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jordan\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. The film was released worldwide on 1 October 2014 to generally positive feedback from critics. The film became one of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Telugu%20films%20of%202014\"&gt;highest-grossing Telugu films of 2014&lt;/a&gt;. It was dubbed into &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malayalam\"&gt;Malayalam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20language\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt; as \"Yevadu 2\", \"Ekalavya\" and \"Ram Leela\" respectively.\nPlot.\nBalaraju, the head of his village, lives with his wife Baby, their two sons; Chandrasekhar Rao and Bangari, and two daughters. He has Chandrasekhar become a doctor and builds a local hospital. On the day it is set to open, Chandrasekhar comes back home with his girlfriend Kausalya, also a doctor. Both express their wish to marry, which Balaraju agrees to. But, they also wish to settle in London, which upsets Balaraju, leading to the separation of the father and elder son.\n25 years later, Chandrasekhar, a successful doctor in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, tells the story to his son Abhiram and daughter Indu. Abhiram decides to go home to Balaraju and attempt a reconciliation. He meets his friend, Bunny, at the airport and goes to his bike shop. Abhiram decides to stay for the night and leave the next day. At night, Bunny takes Abhiram to a pub, where they see a dancer and Abhi takes her photos. Abhi goes to the village on Bunny's bike the next day. On the way, he witnesses a &lt;a href=\"cockfight\"&gt;cockfight&lt;/a&gt; organised by Bangari and Baachi; he gets the help of Balaraju to pardon Bangari and get Baachi arrested. Abhiram then introduces himself as a student from London who came here to learn agricultural practices and martial arts. He particularly impresses Balaraju's family when he saves a child's life and so is allowed to stay with them.\nBalaraju's granddaughter Satya comes back from Hyderabad. Abhiram is surprised to see Satya's cultured behaviour and traditional attire, as Bunny and Abhiram previously met her in a pub in Hyderabad. She is equally surprised to see him. Abhiram blackmails Satya with the photos, but she then asks Bangari to get Abhiram's cell phone by telling him that Abhiram is blackmailing her. Their collective efforts fail, and Baachi is also dragged into the affair.\nA fight happens between Abhiram and Baachi, deepening their rivalry. To get rid of Bangari, Balaraju arranges Chitra's marriage. Satya tells Bangari about this who then kidnaps Chitra. Abhiram chases him, saves Chitra and gets Bangari arrested. Satya finds Abhiram's phone and finds out his true identity. Abhiram offers to help Balaraju renovate the hospital he built with his father's assistance; Balaraju accepts the offer. Abhiram finds out that Satya has his phone when he goes to call his father. She deletes the photos of her. After learning that she knows the truth, Abhiram makes a deal with her. They fall in love with each other.\nLater, Chitra, now Abhiram's friend at the house, tells him why Bangari was expelled from the house. Bangari and Chitra love one another and Balaraju does not approve of it, as Bangari is rather spoilt and drinks too much. Frustrated and intoxicated, Bangari enters Chitra's room and tells her of his attempt to rape her so as to marry her. However, Balaraju expels him from the house after catching him. Balaraju's brother-in-law and his son, Rajendra, who plan to set up a &lt;a href=\"Special%20economic%20zone\"&gt;Special economic zone&lt;/a&gt; manufacturing beer, release Bangari from jail. Abhiram's father sends the advanced equipment to Hyderabad, which Bunny and Bangari receive. Bangari attacks Bunny and seizes the equipment. Abhiram stops Bangari and his men and reveals his identity. Bangari realises what he has done and reconciles with Balaraju. The equipment is unloaded at the hospital.\nIndu too visits Balaraju's house. Satya gets engaged to an American NRI doctor. However, she tells Abhiram that she would die if she doesn't marry him. He decides to break up with her and upon hearing this, Bangari objects to the engagement and reveals Abhiram and Indu's identity to the family. When Baby is about to keep their true identities a secret among the rest of the family, Balaraju notices this, who orders Abhiram and Indu to leave the house.\nLater, Abhiram gets a phone call from his father who plans to come back to the village. Suddenly, Baachi kidnaps Indu. An injured Abhiram manages to save her, but gets shot by Baachi. Bangari arrives and Abhiram prevents Baachi from being harmed by saying that Baachi too is a family member. Chandrasekhar comes to the hospital and operates on Abhiram. When Abhiram regains consciousness, Balaraju welcomes him, Indu and then finally Chandrasekhar back into the family after he apologises. The film ends with Abhiram marrying Satya and Bangari to Chitra, also coinciding with Balaraju and Baby's anniversary.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn September 2010, &lt;a href=\"Chiranjeevi\"&gt;Chiranjeevi&lt;/a&gt; invited &lt;a href=\"Krishna%20Vamsi\"&gt;Krishna Vamsi&lt;/a&gt; to discuss making a movie with &lt;a href=\"Ram%20Charan\"&gt;Ram Charan&lt;/a&gt; as the lead. After a story-narration session, they agreed to move ahead. In August 2013, after a three-year gap, it was announced that Ram Charan, &lt;a href=\"Daggubati%20Venkatesh\"&gt;Daggubati Venkatesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krishna%20%28Telugu%20actor%29\"&gt;Krishna&lt;/a&gt; would act in a film directed by Vamsi and produced by &lt;a href=\"Bandla%20Ganesh\"&gt;Bandla Ganesh&lt;/a&gt; under the banner &lt;a href=\"Parameswara%20Art%20Productions\"&gt;Parameswara Art Productions&lt;/a&gt; banner. At that point, however, the script was not yet complete and so the project was still put on hold.\nIn December 2013, Bandla Ganesh tweeted a photo featuring himself, Krishna Vamsi and Director of Photography Sameer Reddy at the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lakshmi%20Narasimha%20Swamy%20Temple%2C%20Antarvedi\"&gt;Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Antarvedi\"&gt;Antarvedi&lt;/a&gt; with the finished script. The film was initially titled \"&lt;a href=\"Vijetha\"&gt;Vijetha&lt;/a&gt;\" after the 1985 Telugu film which featured Chiranjeevi and &lt;a href=\"Bhanupriya\"&gt;Bhanupriya&lt;/a&gt; in the lead roles. In March 2014, the supposed story of the film was leaked onto the internet. The story was that Ram Charan played the role of an NRI who visits his joint family to bridge a gap between his father and his father's younger brother.\nOn 27 March 2014, when the film poster was released, the title was confirmed as \"Govindudu Andarivadele\". In mid April 2014, &lt;a href=\"Yuvan%20Shankar%20Raja\"&gt;Yuvan Shankar Raja&lt;/a&gt; was signed up as the film's composer after &lt;a href=\"S.%20Thaman\"&gt;S. Thaman&lt;/a&gt; opted out because of conflicting projects. Sources reported that talks were also held with &lt;a href=\"G.%20V.%20Prakash%20Kumar\"&gt;G. V. Prakash Kumar&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first time that Krishna Vamsi had collaborated with Yuvan Shankar Raja, with the director later informing that he had waited five years to work with the composer. Reports regarding Rajkiran being replaced by Prakash Raj because of Chiranjeevi and the altering of the original script, and that Prakash Raj was included to strengthen the Telugu cultural identity of the film were dismissed as rumours. The film's shoot was put on hold due to the climate at the shooting spot being unsuitable for children acting in the film rather than because of Chiranjeevi. Ram Charan, in an interview with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hindu\"&gt;The Hindu&lt;/a&gt;\", said that Rajkiran was replaced with Prakash Raj as the sections involving the former ended up looking more like a &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20cinema\"&gt;Tamil film&lt;/a&gt;.\nCasting.\nVamsi wanted to cast a popular actor as the protagonist to widen the film's appeal, and approached &lt;a href=\"Ram%20Charan\"&gt;Ram Charan&lt;/a&gt; because of his relationship with him since Charan's childhood. &lt;a href=\"Venkatesh%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Venkatesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krishna%20%28Telugu%20actor%29\"&gt;Krishna&lt;/a&gt; were initially set to play the lead roles along with Charan, with Venkatesh playing the role of Charan's paternal uncle. In September 2013, &lt;a href=\"Kajal%20Aggarwal\"&gt;Kajal Aggarwal&lt;/a&gt; was signed to play opposite Charan. Actor &lt;a href=\"Jagapati%20Babu\"&gt;Jagapati Babu&lt;/a&gt; turned down the role of Charan's father as he wanted to concentrate on antagonistic character roles.\nIn November 2013, Tamil actor &lt;a href=\"Rajkiran\"&gt;Rajkiran&lt;/a&gt; was chosen to play the role of Charan's grandfather, previously earmarked for Krishna. The producers also began searching for a new actress in the lead role. In December 2013, Venkatesh left the project and was subsequently replaced by Telugu actor &lt;a href=\"Meka%20Srikanth\"&gt;Srikanth&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the role did not suit his image rather than any other dissatisfaction. &lt;a href=\"Chandini%20Chowdary\"&gt;Chandini Chowdary&lt;/a&gt; was rumoured to have been signed up as the female lead, but this proved not to be the case. &lt;a href=\"Tamannaah\"&gt;Tamannaah&lt;/a&gt; was approached as well, but she had prior commitments in \"&lt;a href=\"Aagadu\"&gt;Aagadu&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\". Kajal was finalised by the end of 2013 as Charan's heroine in this film, marking her return to &lt;a href=\"Telugu%20Cinema\"&gt;Telugu Cinema&lt;/a&gt; after a brief hiatus.\n&lt;a href=\"Kamalini%20Mukherjee\"&gt;Kamalini Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; was chosen by Krishna Vamsi in late January 2014 by Krishna Vamsi, mainly because of her appearance and her acting talent. A song from rock band \"The Tapes\" took seven to nine hours to film for a sequence in the film featuring Charan and Kajal. This was the band's first onscreen appearance. &lt;a href=\"Vennela%20Kishore\"&gt;Vennela Kishore&lt;/a&gt; confirmed his presence in the film twice through his Twitter account.\nIn the end of May 2014, &lt;a href=\"Prakash%20Raj\"&gt;Prakash Raj&lt;/a&gt; replaced Rajkiran as Ram Charan's grandfather. Vamsi said \"Raj Kiran was cast initially and I had doubts about this casting. After shooting a few scenes, I went to Chiranjeevi and he suggested, 'You can think of taking someone who can carry Telugu nativity.' He just made that suggestion, but that was when I replaced Raj Kiran with Prakash Raj\". He added that Chiranjeevi did not interfere in this decision. However, Chiranjeevi helped Vamsi and Raj reconcile their differences. &lt;a href=\"Jayasudha\"&gt;Jayasudha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rahman%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Rahman&lt;/a&gt; were signed for key roles. &lt;a href=\"M.%20S.%20Narayana\"&gt;M. S. Narayana&lt;/a&gt; was selected to play a supporting role. &lt;a href=\"Adarsh%20Balakrishna\"&gt;Adarsh Balakrishna&lt;/a&gt; was selected to portray the film's antagonist, recommended by Srikanth to Vamsi.\nCharacterisation.\nRam Charan's character was Abhiram, an NRI who goes from London to India in search of his roots. He was depicted as the star player of a professional &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; footballer at &lt;a href=\"Hemel%20Hempstead\"&gt;Hemel Hempstead&lt;/a&gt; Charan grew a &lt;a href=\"ponytail\"&gt;ponytail&lt;/a&gt;\nand appeared in traditional Telugu costume, wearing a &lt;a href=\"dhoti\"&gt;dhoti&lt;/a&gt; for some scenes in the film, contrasting with the modern clothes he wore in previous films. He also learnt &lt;a href=\"stick%20fighting\"&gt;stick fighting&lt;/a&gt; skills for the film.\nVamsi showed Charan a lot of family dramas, drove him to villages to help him understand the atmosphere and mindset of the people. According to Vamsi, Charan \"comes across as a shy and reserved guy but has a fun and family loving side to him\", which he tried to show onscreen. Srikanth played the role of Charan's younger paternal uncle and wore his hair long for the role. His costume was rustic in appearance. A still of him in costume was shown in the end of July 2014. His \"crucial role\" in the film was aggressive and rebellious.\nKajal Aggarwal revealed one of her outfits in the film on 27 July 2014 would be a black half-sari. Jayasudha was selected to play the role of Prakash Raj's wife in the film while Rahman was signed in to play the role of Ram Charan's father. Kamalini Mukherjee's character was named Chitra, a rural girl quite unlike the urbane roles she had played in the past. Adarsh Balakrishna, cast as a flashy &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Parliament\"&gt;M. P.&lt;/a&gt;'s son living in the same village, wore jewellery with Indian costume, again with long hair.\nFilming.\n&lt;a href=\"Principal%20photography\"&gt;Principal photography&lt;/a&gt; began on 6 February 2014 in &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad%2C%20India\"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; and continued for 3 days there before a long pre-planned schedule started in &lt;a href=\"Rameswaram\"&gt;Rameswaram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nagercoil\"&gt;Nagercoil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pollachi\"&gt;Pollachi&lt;/a&gt;. Kajal joined the sets of the film in Hyderabad on 9 February 2014 and some scenes between herself and Charan were shot there. They also participated in the film's shoot at Nagercoil near &lt;a href=\"Kanyakumari\"&gt;Kanyakumari&lt;/a&gt; in mid February 2014 after the completion of the schedule at Rameswaram. A fight sequence with Charan, Srikanth and others was filmed at Kanyakumari before shifting to Pollachi. A few action sequences focusing Charan were shot at Pollachi in late March 2014. He also worked on some key action sequences for the film under the supervision of Ram Lakshman in mid May 2014, for which a special set was built. Some song sequences were shot in &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; from 2 June 2014.\nThe film's shoot continued in Hyderabad from 5 June 2014 and the team planned to go to London after filming some family scenes at the special house set constructed earlier in &lt;a href=\"Ramanaidu%20Studios\"&gt;Ramanaidu Cine Village&lt;/a&gt; in Hyderabad. 30 scenes and 2 songs were shot in that house set in Hyderabad over a period of 45 days. Prakash Raj allotted bulk dates and the reshoot took 8 days only and not 20 days as earlier reported. After completing the shoot of few scenes and a montage song, the first part of the film's Hyderabad schedule ended on 18 June 2014. The next part commenced on 21 June 2014. At the end of June 2014, another song was shot on a special set featuring mirrors, in which the lead pair participated. Due to incessant rain at Pollachi, the shooting continued at Hyderabad, delaying the planned schedule. The Pollachi schedule therefore began on 23 July 2014, lasting for 5 days. A fresh schedule began in &lt;a href=\"Karaikudi\"&gt;Karaikudi&lt;/a&gt; on whose completion, filming continued in Hyderabad from 4 August 2014. The film's shoot was temporarily halted on 19 August 2014 because of the statewide survey in Telangana.\nThe next schedule began in London on 22 August 2014. A romantic song was shot on Charan and Kajal in early September 2014 in &lt;a href=\"Jordan\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. After its completion, a song was shot with the lead pair in London. The production unit returned to Hyderabad on 14 September 2014. A quarter of the film was shot in London. Charan's introduction scene was shot at the Pennine Way Stadium, and a rugby match was shot at the Rugby League club in &lt;a href=\"Hemel%20Hempstead\"&gt;Hemel Hempstead&lt;/a&gt; in Hertfordshire in south-eastern England. To add some authenticity, the local club captain B. J. Swindells was brought on board. Two songs sequences were shot simultaneously in Hyderabad.\nThe principal photography ended on 22 September 2014 on completion of the songs shoot. However, it was officially announced later that the film would be released without a song which would be shot on 2 and 3 October and then be added to the film.\nPost-production.\nThe film's &lt;a href=\"Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29\"&gt;dubbing&lt;/a&gt; activities commenced at Shabdalaya Studios in Hyderabad on 18 July 2014. The supporting cast then dubbed their respective roles. Yuvan Shankar Raja started re-recording for the film's first half on 26 August 2014 at his studio in Chennai. Srikanth completed dubbing for his role on 10 September 2014 and Charan completed dubbing on 24 September 2014. Chiranjeevi personally monitored the post-production works and promotion strategies. In an interview with the \"&lt;a href=\"Deccan%20Chronicle\"&gt;Deccan Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\", Chiranjeevi mentioned that Charan also participated in the production and editing of the film's trailer and took extra care of the trailer's release and had asked him to check if everything was right. While shooting two songs at Hyderabad, the post production works were completed.\nA copy of the film was sent to &lt;a href=\"Central%20Board%20of%20Film%20Certification\"&gt;Central Board of Film Certification&lt;/a&gt; on 26 September 2014. The same day, the film was awarded an 'U/A' certificate instead of a clean 'U' due to some sections and scenes between the lead actors. The Board asked the makers to obtain a &lt;a href=\"No%20Objection%20Certificate\"&gt;No Objection Certificate&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Welfare%20Board%20of%20India\"&gt;Animal Welfare Board of India&lt;/a&gt; to retain scenes featuring animals. They muted a few dialogues as well as \"backless\" views of the heroine. They also insisted on obscuring the brands on alcoholic drinks as well as the display of mandatory warnings \"when Srikanth is smoking\".\nThemes and influences.\nRam Charan said in an interview that the film was partially inspired by \"&lt;a href=\"Seetharamaiah%20Gari%20Manavaralu\"&gt;Seetharamaiah Gari Manavaralu&lt;/a&gt;\" (1991), although there were also remarks about tracing inspiration from Vamsi's previous works, \"&lt;a href=\"Ninne%20Pelladata%20%281996%20film%29\"&gt;Ninne Pelladata&lt;/a&gt;\" (1996) and \"&lt;a href=\"Murari%20%28film%29\"&gt;Murari&lt;/a&gt;\" (2001). Critics also compared the film to other family dramas like \"&lt;a href=\"Brindavanam%20%282010%20film%29\"&gt;Brindavanam&lt;/a&gt;\" (2010) and \"&lt;a href=\"Attarintiki%20Daredi\"&gt;Attarintiki Daredi&lt;/a&gt;\" (2013).\nIn an interview with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hindu\"&gt;The Hindu&lt;/a&gt;, \"Vamsi said \"Tell me one new story that has been written since &lt;a href=\"Ramayana\"&gt;Ramayana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mahabharata\"&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Aatma%20Bandhuvu\"&gt;Aatma Bandhuvu&lt;/a&gt;\" (1962), \"&lt;a href=\"Devudu%20Chesina%20Manushulu%20%281973%20film%29\"&gt;Devudu Chesina Manushulu&lt;/a&gt;\" (1973), \"Ramarajyamlo Bheemaraju\" (1983) and \"Muddula Manavaralu\" (1996)\u00a0\u2014 which was a remake of the Tamil film \"&lt;a href=\"Poove%20Poochooda%20Vaa\"&gt;Poove Poochooda Vaa&lt;/a&gt;\" (1985)\u00a0\u2014 all had a similar structure of a protagonist returning to unite a family\". He added that this film was made to showcase the folk arts, music and spirituality of the Telugu people. He also drew inspiration from the husband and wife scenes shown in the film \"&lt;a href=\"Kabhi%20Khushi%20Kabhie%20Gham...\"&gt;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&lt;/a&gt;\" (2001), as he wanted to incorporate the same themes into &lt;a href=\"Telugu%20cinema\"&gt;Telugu films&lt;/a&gt;.\nMusic.\n&lt;a href=\"Yuvan%20Shankar%20Raja\"&gt;Yuvan Shankar Raja&lt;/a&gt; composed the music for the film, which marked his first collaboration with Vamsi; it was also the first time he scored for a film starring Srikanth and Ram Charan. The soundtrack, consisting of six songs, was released on 1 September 2014 at &lt;a href=\"Shilpakala%20Vedika\"&gt;Shilpakala Vedika&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad\"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt;. The audio rights were purchased by &lt;a href=\"Aditya%20Music\"&gt;Aditya Music&lt;/a&gt;. The soundtrack received positive reviews from critics.\nRelease.\nThe film was released on 1 October 2014. The makers wanted to capitalise on the long holiday of &lt;a href=\"Navratri\"&gt;Navratri&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Eid%20al-Adha\"&gt;Bakrid&lt;/a&gt;. Charan attended the film's premiere show in the United States on 30 September 2014 alongside other cast and crew members. \"Govindudu Andarivadele\" was released in 750 screens in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, 100 in Karnataka, 50 in Tamil Nadu, 85 in Maharashtra and 60 in other parts of North India.

Krishnavamsi walks this predictable path in \"Govindudu Andarivadele\"\" and added \"This oft-repeated tale, has shades of several family dramas told earlier in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi cinema.
