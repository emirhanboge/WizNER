    "text": "A bond index or bond market index is a method of measuring the investment performance and characteristics of the &lt;a href=\"bond%20market\"&gt;bond market&lt;/a&gt;. There are numerous indices of differing construction that are designed to measure the aggregate bond market and its various sectors (government, municipal, corporate, etc.) A bond index is computed from the change in market prices and, in the case of a &lt;a href=\"total%20return%20index\"&gt;total return index&lt;/a&gt;, the interest payments, associated with selected &lt;a href=\"Bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt; over a specified period of time. Bond indices are used by &lt;a href=\"investor\"&gt;investor&lt;/a&gt;s and portfolio managers as a benchmark against which to measure the performance of actively managed bond portfolios, which attempt to outperform the index, and passively managed bond portfolios, that are designed to match the performance of the index. Bond indices are also used in determining the compensation of those who manage bond portfolios on a performance-fee basis.\nAn index is a mathematical construct, so it may not be invested in directly. But many &lt;a href=\"mutual%20fund\"&gt;mutual fund&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"exchange-traded%20fund\"&gt;exchange-traded fund&lt;/a&gt;s attempt to \"track\" an index (see &lt;a href=\"index%20fund\"&gt;index fund&lt;/a&gt;), and those funds that do not may be judged against those that do. \nHistory.\nTotal return bond indices were first developed in the 1970s, at which point they measured only U.S. investment grade bonds. Indices for high-yield (below investment grade) U.S. bonds and non-U.S. government bonds were developed in the mid-1980s. During this period it became increasingly apparent that most portfolio managers were unable to outperform the bond market. This resulted in the development of passively managed bond index funds, and the proliferation of indices themselves.\nCharacteristics.\nCharacteristics that are relevant in judging bond indices include:\nThere are certain challenges inherent in constructing and maintaining a bond market index: \nIndices and passive investment management.\nInvestment companies develop and market passively managed fixed income mutual funds which are designed to match the performance of a particular bond index. In selecting such a fund, risk tolerance is a key consideration. Funds which match indices that include corporate bonds will expose the investor to credit risk, particularly if below-investment-grade corporate bonds are involved. If that risk is unacceptable, the investor should avoid a fund that includes these sectors.\nUsually, passive portfolio managers purchase a subset of the issues included in their benchmark index. But their portfolio's performance is measured against the entire index. Since bond indices typically contain more securities than stock indices, passive bond fund managers face a more difficult task than their stock index fund counterparts with respect matching the performance of their benchmark. Often the average &lt;a href=\"bond%20duration\"&gt;duration&lt;/a&gt; of the market may not be the most appropriate duration for a given portfolio. Replication of an index's characteristics can be achieved by using bond futures to match the duration of the bond index.\nBroker/dealer firms have created their own proprietary bond market indices. These indices can create new sources of revenue for the firm. The creator of the index will charge a fee for providing the index information needed to set up and rebalance a portfolio tied to its proprietary index, but also expect their clients to use their trading desk to execute the bulk of the transactions. \nInvestment managers sometimes create customized indices designed to meet a client's requirements and long-term investment goals. For example, in 1986 Salomon Brothers introduced a bond index designed specifically for large pension funds \"seeking to establish core portfolios that more closely match the longer durations of their nominal dollar liabilities.\""
