Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Rot%20Weiss%20Ahlen\"&gt;Leichtathletik Rasensport Ahlen&lt;/a&gt; with Obinna scoring Yeovil's consolation goal, but that was the last contribution for Obinna as he was released upon Yeovil's return home. Upon the club's return, they briefly took former &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.\"&gt;Nottingham Forest&lt;/a&gt; striker &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Westcarr\"&gt;Craig Westcarr&lt;/a&gt; on trial, before their first home friendly of the season against &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%20F.C.\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;.

With manager &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Johnson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201955%29\"&gt;Gary Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, saying of the fee, \"we have signed him for a club record fee but that will remain undisclosed. All I can say is that it is not six figures which some people are presuming.\"\nAugust.\nYeovil's season opener in their first season in &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20One\"&gt;League One&lt;/a&gt; saw them travel to &lt;a href=\"Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Oldham Athletic&lt;/a&gt;, on 6 August. Without record signing &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Bastianini\"&gt;Pablo Bastianini&lt;/a&gt; whose international clearance had failed to come through Yeovil lost the match 2\u20130. On the same day a Yeovil Town XI side faced &lt;a href=\"Sherborne%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Sherborne Town&lt;/a&gt; in a friendly match and recorded a 3\u20130 win with Argentine trialist &lt;a href=\"Luciano%20%C3%81lvarez\"&gt;Luciano \u00c1lvarez&lt;/a&gt; scoring a brace and &lt;a href=\"Dale%20Williams%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Dale Williams&lt;/a&gt; with the third.

Bastianini's debut though saw Yeovil lost 1\u20130 away at &lt;a href=\"Barnsley%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnsley&lt;/a&gt; a result which saw Yeovil fall to the foot of the table. On 23 August, Yeovil faced &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Championship\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Ipswich Town&lt;/a&gt; in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt;.

On 17 September, Yeovil drew 1\u20131 away at &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Reed%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Stephen Reed&lt;/a&gt; having returned from his loan at &lt;a href=\"Woking%20F.C.\"&gt;Woking&lt;/a&gt; was immediately sent out on loan to &lt;a href=\"Aldershot%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Aldershot Town&lt;/a&gt;. Yeovil then faced &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20F.C.\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt; in the second round of the League Cup, after being reduced to ten-men Yeovil were knocked out losing 2\u20131. The game turned out to be the last match at Yeovil for manager &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Johnson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201955%29\"&gt;Gary Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, who left the club to join West Country rivals &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol City&lt;/a&gt;. Johnson departed after four seasons in which he had overseen two promotions and victory in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Trophy\"&gt;FA Trophy&lt;/a&gt;. Johnson's assistant &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Thompson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201963%29\"&gt;Steve Thompson&lt;/a&gt; took over as caretaker boss and recorded a 1\u20130 victory in his first match in charge against &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt;, with summer signing &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Harrold\"&gt;Matt Harrold&lt;/a&gt; scoring his first goal for the club. On 27 September, Yeovil travelled to &lt;a href=\"Southend%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Southend United&lt;/a&gt; and despite taking the lead courtesy of a Jevons free-kick ultimately lost 4\u20131. The end of September also saw Thompson bring in former Yeovil goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Len%20Bond\"&gt;Len Bond&lt;/a&gt; as the club's new goalkeeping coach.\nOctober.\nYeovil started October with a trip to &lt;a href=\"Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Scunthorpe United&lt;/a&gt; and after trailing 2\u20130 inside the first 20 minutes, Yeovil mounted a remarkable comeback to win the match 4\u20133 with goals from &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Way\"&gt;Darren Way&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Jevons\"&gt;Phil Jevons&lt;/a&gt; and a brace from first-half substitute &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Harrold\"&gt;Matt Harrold&lt;/a&gt;. That result was enough to convince the Yeovil board to appoint manager &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Thompson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201963%29\"&gt;Steve Thompson&lt;/a&gt; on a permanent basis. Thompson celebrated his permanent appointment with a 1\u20130 victory over league leaders &lt;a href=\"Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Swansea City&lt;/a&gt;, a result which saw Yeovil rise to eighth in the table. On 10 October, Yeovil appointed former &lt;a href=\"Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.\"&gt;Plymouth Argyle&lt;/a&gt; manager &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Hodges\"&gt;Kevin Hodges&lt;/a&gt; as their new assistant manager to work with Steve Thompson. Yeovil then faced two away matches recording a goalless draw against &lt;a href=\"Gillingham%20F.C.\"&gt;Gillingham&lt;/a&gt;, before losing 2\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.\"&gt;Leyton Orient&lt;/a&gt; in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Trophy\"&gt;Football League Trophy&lt;/a&gt;.

On 20 October, Yeovil confirmed &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Lindegaard\"&gt;Andy Lindegaard&lt;/a&gt; had extended his loan at &lt;a href=\"Crawley%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Crawley Town&lt;/a&gt; for another month. On 22 October, Yeovil recorded an impressive a 3\u20130 win against &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.\"&gt;Nottingham Forest&lt;/a&gt;, with Jevons scoring a brace. On 24 October, the club confirmed the departure of Uruguay &lt;a href=\"Alejandro%20Melo%C3%B1o\"&gt;Alejandro Melo\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt; after his contract terminated by mutual consent having only started two matches. Yeovil ended the month losing 3\u20132 away at &lt;a href=\"Colchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Colchester United&lt;/a&gt;.\nNovember.\nYeovil needed a late goal from &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Jevons\"&gt;Phil Jevons&lt;/a&gt; to salvage a replay in their &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; first round match against &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Two\"&gt;League Two&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Macclesfield%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Macclesfield Town&lt;/a&gt;. After a series of injuries in central midfield, Yeovil signed &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt; midfielder &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Cohen\"&gt;Chris Cohen&lt;/a&gt; on a month-loan deal, that was subsequently extended until the end of the season. Yeovil then suffered a 2\u20131 home defeat against &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Huddersfield Town&lt;/a&gt;, before on 15 November, Yeovil faced Macclesfield in their FA Cup first round replay and a goalscoring return of &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Way\"&gt;Darren Way&lt;/a&gt; from injury led Yeovil to a 4\u20130 victory. On 18 November, full-back &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Lockwood\"&gt;Adam Lockwood&lt;/a&gt; joined &lt;a href=\"Torquay%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Torquay United&lt;/a&gt; on a month's loan. Yeovil then suffered two defeats to end November losing 2\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Swansea City&lt;/a&gt;, before losing by the same scoreline at home to &lt;a href=\"Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Oldham Athletic&lt;/a&gt;. The Swansea match saw midfielder Darren Way suffer a recurrence of a shin injury that ruled him out until January.

Yeovil then boosted their survival hopes with a 3\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Doncaster Rovers&lt;/a&gt; with goals from &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Skiverton\"&gt;Terry Skiverton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Jevons\"&gt;Phil Jevons&lt;/a&gt; and Arron Davies.

Yeovil took the lead through an early Phil Jevons free-kick away at &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.\"&gt;Nottingham Forest&lt;/a&gt; but the Reds fought back to condemn Yeovil to a 2\u20131 defeat.

Yeovil's final match of the season saw them welcome second place &lt;a href=\"Colchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Colchester United&lt;/a&gt;, having already confirmed their safety Yeovil earned a credible 0\u20130 draw to finish the season in 15th position.
