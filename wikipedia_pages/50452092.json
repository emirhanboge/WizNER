It was described by &lt;a href=\"August%20Busck\"&gt;August Busck&lt;/a&gt; in 1911. It is found in the &lt;a href=\"Guianas\"&gt;Guianas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"wingspan\"&gt;wingspan&lt;/a&gt; is 18\u201321\u00a0mm. The forewings are very light rosy drab with three triangular, equidistant, blackish brown costal spots, the two outer ones large and very prominent, the basal one at the basal third of the costa smaller. On the end of the cell is a small transverse dark brown spot and from the tip of the outer costal spot runs an outwardly curved row of small equidistant dark brown dots across the wing to the dorsum. The extreme terminal edge is deep black. The hindwings are whitish with yellow tips."
