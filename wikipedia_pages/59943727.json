    "text": "The Forty Thieves, subtitled Striking Oil in Family Jars, is an 1869 &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20burlesque\"&gt;Victorian burlesque&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Lydia%20Thompson\"&gt;Lydia Thompson&lt;/a&gt;'s company debuted at &lt;a href=\"Niblo%27s%20Garden\"&gt;Niblo's Garden&lt;/a&gt; in New York City on February 1, 1869. It ran for 136 performances.\nThe work was written by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Brougham%20Farnie\"&gt;Henry Brougham Farnie&lt;/a&gt; though it was primarily a \"reconstructed\" version of \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, or Harlequin and the Genii of the Arabian Nights\", which played at &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt; in 1866, with jokes and other new material added for an 1868 &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; production. It was produced by Henry C. Jarrett and Harry Palmer. \nThe primary gimmick of the show was that women played all the main male roles, just as Thompson had done with \"Ixion\" with great success when her troupe first came over from Britain in 1868. \"Ixion\" had played at the smaller &lt;a href=\"Daly%27s%20Theatre%20%2830th%20St.%29\"&gt;Wood's Museum&lt;/a&gt;, so Thompson's move to Niblo's (which seated 3,200) for \"Forty Thieves\" demonstrated her troupe's growing popularity. In this show, women also played all of the forty thieves. Thompson's success generated backlash and became the subject of an anti-burlesque sentiment that arose that year. Despite the negative attacks on burlesque's \"leg business\", \"Forty Thieves\" ran until May 1869. Its take in February 1869 was $54,487, the best month of any New York theater for two years, and better than the long-running \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Crook\"&gt;Black Crook&lt;/a&gt;\" had done in any month.\nOriginal Broadway cast.\nAfter some updates to the play in April 1869, Clara Thompson appeared as Amber, and Lizzie Kelsey became the Fairy Queen. &lt;a href=\"Bessie%20Sudlow\"&gt;Bessie Sudlow&lt;/a&gt; also joined the cast"
