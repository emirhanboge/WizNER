    "text": "Francis I (; ; 12 September 1494 \u2013 31 March 1547) was &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20France\"&gt;King of France&lt;/a&gt; from 1515 until his death in 1547. He was the son of &lt;a href=\"Charles%2C%20Count%20of%20Angoul%C3%AAme\"&gt;Charles, Count of Angoul\u00eame&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Louise%20of%20Savoy\"&gt;Louise of Savoy&lt;/a&gt;. He succeeded his first cousin once removed and father in-law &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XII%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XII&lt;/a&gt;, who died without a son. \nA prodigious &lt;a href=\"patron%20of%20the%20arts\"&gt;patron of the arts&lt;/a&gt;, he promoted the emergent &lt;a href=\"French%20Renaissance\"&gt;French Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; by attracting many Italian artists to work for him, including &lt;a href=\"Leonardo%20da%20Vinci\"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt;, who brought the \"&lt;a href=\"Mona%20Lisa\"&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/a&gt;\" with him, which Francis had acquired. Francis' reign saw important cultural changes with the growth of central power in France, the spread of &lt;a href=\"humanism\"&gt;humanism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestantism&lt;/a&gt;, and the beginning of French exploration of the &lt;a href=\"New%20World\"&gt;New World&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Cartier\"&gt;Jacques Cartier&lt;/a&gt; and others claimed lands in the Americas for France and paved the way for the expansion of the first &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;French colonial empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor his role in the development and promotion of the &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French language&lt;/a&gt;, he became known as \"le P\u00e8re et Restaurateur des Lettres\" (the 'Father and Restorer of Letters'). He was also known as \"Fran\u00e7ois au Grand Nez\" ('Francis of the Large Nose'), the \"Grand Colas\", and the \"Roi-Chevalier\" (the 'Knight-King') for his personal involvement in the wars against his great rival &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Charles%20V\"&gt;Emperor Charles V&lt;/a&gt;, who was also &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Spain\"&gt;King of Spain&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the policy of his predecessors, Francis continued the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Wars\"&gt;Italian Wars&lt;/a&gt;. The succession of Charles V to the Burgundian Netherlands, the throne of Spain, and his subsequent election as &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, meant that France was geographically encircled by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Habsburg\"&gt;Habsburg monarchy&lt;/a&gt;. In his struggle against Imperial hegemony, Francis sought the support of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII of England&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20the%20Cloth%20of%20Gold\"&gt;Field of the Cloth of Gold&lt;/a&gt;. When this was unsuccessful, he formed a &lt;a href=\"Franco-Ottoman%20alliance\"&gt;Franco-Ottoman alliance&lt;/a&gt; with the Muslim sultan &lt;a href=\"Suleiman%20the%20Magnificent\"&gt;Suleiman the Magnificent&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial move for a Christian king at the time.\nEarly life and accession.\nFrancis of Orl\u00e9ans was born on 12 September 1494 at the Ch\u00e2teau de Cognac in the town of &lt;a href=\"Cognac%2C%20France\"&gt;Cognac&lt;/a&gt;, which at that time lay in the province of &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Saintonge\"&gt;Saintonge&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine\"&gt;Duchy of Aquitaine&lt;/a&gt;. Today the town lies in the &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Charente\"&gt;Charente&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrancis was the only son of &lt;a href=\"Charles%2C%20Count%20of%20Angoul%C3%AAme\"&gt;Charles of Orl\u00e9ans, Count of Angoul\u00eame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Louise%20of%20Savoy\"&gt;Louise of Savoy&lt;/a&gt;, and a great-great-grandson of King &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles V of France&lt;/a&gt;. His family was not expected to inherit the throne, as his third cousin King &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VIII%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles VIII&lt;/a&gt; was still young at the time of his birth, as was his father's cousin the &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XII%20of%20France\"&gt;Duke of Orl\u00e9ans&lt;/a&gt;, later King Louis XII. However, Charles VIII died childless in 1498 and was succeeded by Louis XII, who himself had no male heir. The &lt;a href=\"Salic%20Law\"&gt;Salic Law&lt;/a&gt; prevented women from inheriting the throne. Therefore, the four-year-old Francis (who was already &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Angoul%C3%AAme\"&gt;Count of Angoul\u00eame&lt;/a&gt; after the death of his own father two years earlier) became the &lt;a href=\"heir%20presumptive\"&gt;heir presumptive&lt;/a&gt; to the throne of France in 1498 and was vested with the title of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Valois\"&gt;Duke of Valois&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1505, Louis XII, having fallen ill, ordered for his daughter &lt;a href=\"Claude%20of%20France\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; and Francis to be married immediately, but only through an assembly of nobles were the two engaged. Claude was heir presumptive to the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Duchy of Brittany&lt;/a&gt; through her mother, &lt;a href=\"Anne%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Anne of Brittany&lt;/a&gt;. Following Anne's death, the marriage took place on 18 May 1514. On 1 January 1515, Louis died, and Francis inherited the throne. He was crowned King of France in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Reims\"&gt;Cathedral of Reims&lt;/a&gt; on 25 January 1515, with Claude as his &lt;a href=\"Queen%20consort%20of%20France\"&gt;queen consort&lt;/a&gt;.\nReign.\nAs Francis was receiving his education, ideas emerging from the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Renaissance\"&gt;Italian Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; were influential in France. Some of his tutors, such as &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Desmoulins%20de%20Rochefort\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Desmoulins de Rochefort&lt;/a&gt; (his Latin instructor, who later during the reign of Francis was named &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Almoner%20of%20France\"&gt;\"Grand Aum\u00f4nier de France\"&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Christophe%20de%20Longueil\"&gt;Christophe de Longueil&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Brabant\"&gt;Brabantian&lt;/a&gt; humanist), were attracted by these new ways of thinking and attempted to influence Francis. His academic education had been in &lt;a href=\"arithmetic\"&gt;arithmetic&lt;/a&gt;, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and he became proficient in &lt;a href=\"Hebrew\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italian%20%28language%29\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;. Francis came to learn chivalry, dancing, and music, and he loved archery, falconry, horseback riding, hunting, jousting, &lt;a href=\"real%20tennis\"&gt;real tennis&lt;/a&gt; and wrestling. He ended up reading philosophy and theology and he was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science. His mother, who had a high admiration for &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Renaissance%20art\"&gt;Italian Renaissance art&lt;/a&gt;, passed this interest on to her son. Although Francis did not receive a humanist education, he was more influenced by &lt;a href=\"humanism\"&gt;humanism&lt;/a&gt; than any previous French king.\nPatron of the arts.\nBy the time he ascended the throne in 1515, the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; had arrived in France, and Francis became an enthusiastic patron of the arts. At the time of his accession, the royal palaces of France were ornamented with only a scattering of great paintings, and not a single sculpture, either ancient or modern. During Francis' reign, the magnificent art collection of the French kings, which can still be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Louvre\"&gt;Louvre&lt;/a&gt;, was begun.\nFrancis patronized many great artists of his time, including &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20del%20Sarto\"&gt;Andrea del Sarto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leonardo%20da%20Vinci\"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt;; the latter of whom was persuaded to make France his home during his last years. While da Vinci painted very little during his years in France, he brought with him many of his greatest works, including the \"&lt;a href=\"Mona%20Lisa\"&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/a&gt;\" (known in France as \"La Joconde\"), and these remained in France after his death. Other major artists to receive Francis' patronage included the goldsmith &lt;a href=\"Benvenuto%20Cellini\"&gt;Benvenuto Cellini&lt;/a&gt; and the painters &lt;a href=\"Rosso%20Fiorentino\"&gt;Rosso Fiorentino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giulio%20Romano\"&gt;Giulio Romano&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Primaticcio\"&gt;Primaticcio&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom were employed in decorating Francis' various palaces. He also invited the noted architect &lt;a href=\"Sebastiano%20Serlio\"&gt;Sebastiano Serlio&lt;/a&gt; (1475\u20131554), who enjoyed a fruitful late career in France. Francis also commissioned a number of agents in Italy to procure notable works of art and ship them to France.\nMan of letters.\nFrancis was also renowned as a &lt;a href=\"man%20of%20letters\"&gt;man of letters&lt;/a&gt;. When Francis comes up in a conversation among characters in &lt;a href=\"Baldassare%20Castiglione\"&gt;Baldassare Castiglione&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Courtier\"&gt;Book of the Courtier&lt;/a&gt;\", it is as the great hope to bring culture to the war-obsessed French nation. Not only did Francis support a number of major writers of the period, but he was also a poet himself, if not one of particular abilities. Francis worked diligently at improving the royal library. He appointed the great French humanist &lt;a href=\"Guillaume%20Bud%C3%A9\"&gt;Guillaume Bud\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; as chief librarian and began to expand the collection. Francis employed agents in Italy to look for rare books and manuscripts, just as he had agents looking for art works. During his reign, the size of the library greatly increased. Not only did he expand the library, there is also evidence that he read the books he bought for it, a much rarer event in the royal annals. Francis set an important precedent by opening his library to scholars from around the world in order to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge.\nIn 1537, Francis signed the &lt;a href=\"Ordonnance%20de%20Montpellier\"&gt;Ordonnance de Montpellier&lt;/a&gt;, which decreed that his library be given a copy of every book to be sold in France. Francis' older sister, &lt;a href=\"Marguerite%20de%20Navarre\"&gt;Marguerite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Navarrese%20monarchs\"&gt;Queen of Navarre&lt;/a&gt;, was also an accomplished writer who produced the classic collection of short stories known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Heptameron\"&gt;Heptameron&lt;/a&gt;\". Francis corresponded with the abbess and philosopher &lt;a href=\"Claude%20de%20Bectoz\"&gt;Claude de Bectoz&lt;/a&gt;, of whose letters he was so fond that he would carry them around and show them to the ladies of his court.\nTogether with his sister, he visited her in &lt;a href=\"Tarascon\"&gt;Tarascon&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction.\nFrancis poured vast amounts of money into new structures. He continued the work of his predecessors on the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Amboise\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise&lt;/a&gt; and also started renovations on the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Blois\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau de Blois&lt;/a&gt;. Early in his reign, he began construction of the magnificent &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chambord\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by the architectural styles of the Italian renaissance, and perhaps even designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Francis rebuilt the &lt;a href=\"Louvre%20Palace\"&gt;Louvre Palace&lt;/a&gt;, transforming it from a &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20Louvre\"&gt;medieval fortress&lt;/a&gt; into a building of Renaissance splendour. He financed the building of a new City Hall (the \"&lt;a href=\"H%C3%B4tel%20de%20Ville%2C%20Paris\"&gt;H\u00f4tel de Ville&lt;/a&gt;\") for Paris in order to have control over the building's design. He constructed the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Madrid\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau de Madrid&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bois%20de%20Boulogne\"&gt;Bois de Boulogne&lt;/a&gt; and rebuilt the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye&lt;/a&gt;. The largest of Francis' building projects was the reconstruction and expansion of the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Fontainebleau\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly became his favourite place of residence, as well as the residence of his official mistress, &lt;a href=\"Anne%20de%20Pisseleu%20d%27Heilly\"&gt;Anne, Duchess of \u00c9tampes&lt;/a&gt;. Each of Francis' projects was luxuriously decorated both inside and out. Fontainebleau, for instance, had a gushing fountain in its courtyard where quantities of wine were mixed with the water.\nMilitary action.\nAlthough the Italian Wars (1494\u20131559) came to dominate the reign of Francis I, the wars were not the sole focus of his policies. Francis merely continued the incessant wars that his predecessors had started and that his successors on the throne of France would drag on after Francis' death. Indeed, the Italian Wars had begun when Milan sent a plea to King Charles VIII of France for protection against the aggressive actions of the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Naples\"&gt;King of Naples&lt;/a&gt;. Militarily and diplomatically, Francis' reign was a mixed bag of success and failure. Francis tried and failed to become &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20election%20of%201519\"&gt;Imperial election of 1519&lt;/a&gt;. However, there were also temporary victories, such as in the portion of the Italian Wars called the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20League%20of%20Cambrai\"&gt;War of the League of Cambrai&lt;/a&gt; (1508\u20131516) and, more specifically, to the final stage of that war, which history refers to simply as \"Francis' First Italian War\" (1515\u20131516), when Francis routed the combined forces of the Papal States and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Swiss%20Confederacy\"&gt;Old Swiss Confederacy&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Marignano\"&gt;Marignano&lt;/a&gt; on 13\u201315 September 1515. This victory at Marignano allowed Francis to capture the Italian city-state of &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;. Later, in November 1521, during the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Four Years' War&lt;/a&gt; (1521\u20131526) and facing the advancing Imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire and open revolt within Milan, Francis was forced to abandon Milan, thus, cancelling the triumph at Marignano.\nMuch of the military activity of Francis's reign was focused on his sworn enemy, the Holy Roman Emperor &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt;. Francis and Charles maintained an intense personal rivalry. Charles, in fact, brashly challenged Francis to single combat multiple times. In addition to the Holy Roman Empire, Charles personally ruled Spain, Austria, and a number of smaller possessions neighboring France. He was thus a constant threat to Francis' kingdom.\nFrancis attempted to arrange an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII of England&lt;/a&gt; at the famous meeting at the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Cloth%20of%20Gold\"&gt;Field of Cloth of Gold&lt;/a&gt; on 7 June 1520, but despite a lavish fortnight of diplomacy they failed to reach an agreement. Francis and Henry were both obsessed with dreams of power and chivalric glory; their relationship featured intense personal and dynastic rivalry. Francis was driven by his intense eagerness for retaking Milan, despite the strong opposition of other Powers. Henry was likewise determined to recapture northern France, which Francis could never allow.\nFrancis suffered his most devastating defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pavia\"&gt;Battle of Pavia&lt;/a&gt; on 24 February 1525, during part of the continuing Italian Wars known as the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Four Years' War&lt;/a&gt;. Francis was actually taken prisoner: &lt;a href=\"Cesare%20Hercolani\"&gt;Cesare Hercolani&lt;/a&gt; injured his horse, and Francis was captured by Diego D\u00e1vila, &lt;a href=\"Alonso%20Pita%20da%20Veiga\"&gt;Alonso Pita da Veiga&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Juan%20de%20Urbieta\"&gt;Juan de Urbieta&lt;/a&gt;, from Guip\u00fazcoa. For this reason, Hercolani was named \"Victor of the battle of Pavia\". \"&lt;a href=\"Zuppa%20alla%20Pavese\"&gt;Zuppa alla Pavese&lt;/a&gt;\" was supposedly invented on the spot to feed the captive king right after the battle.\nFrancis I was held captive in Madrid. In a letter to his mother he wrote, \"Of all things, nothing remains to me but honour and life, which is safe.\" This line has come down in history famously as \"All is lost save honour.\" Francis made major concessions to Charles V in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Madrid%20%281526%29\"&gt;Treaty of Madrid (1526)&lt;/a&gt;, signed on 14 January, before he was freed on 17 March. An ultimatum from Ottoman Sultan Suleiman to Charles V also played an important role in his release. Francis I surrendered any claims to Naples and Milan in Italy. Francis recognised the independence of the Duchy of Burgundy, which had been part of France since the death of &lt;a href=\"Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;Charles the Bold&lt;/a&gt; in 1477. And finally, Francis was betrothed to Charles' sister Eleanor. Francis was allowed to return to France in exchange for his two sons, &lt;a href=\"Francis%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Francis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20France\"&gt;Henry&lt;/a&gt;, but once he was free he argued that his agreement with Charles was made under duress. He also claimed that the agreement was void because his sons were taken hostage with the implication that his word alone could not be trusted. Thus he firmly repudiated it. A renewed alliance with England enabled Francis to repudiate the treaty of Madrid.\nFrancis persevered in his hatred of Charles V and desire to control Italy. By the mid-1520s, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Clement%20VII\"&gt;Pope Clement VII&lt;/a&gt; wished to liberate Italy from foreign domination, especially that of Charles V, so he allied with &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Cognac\"&gt;League of Cognac&lt;/a&gt;. Francis joined the League in May 1526, in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20League%20of%20Cognac\"&gt;War of the League of Cognac&lt;/a&gt; of 1526\u201330. Francis' allies proved weak, and the war was ended by the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Cambrai\"&gt;Treaty of Cambrai&lt;/a&gt; (1529; \"the Peace of the Ladies\", negotiated by Francis\u2019 mother and Charles\u2019 aunt). The two boys were released, and Francis married Eleanor.\nAfter the League of Cognac failed, Francis concluded a secret alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Philip%20I%2C%20Landgrave%20of%20Hesse\"&gt;Landgrave of Hesse&lt;/a&gt; on 27 January 1534. This was directed against Charles V on the pretext of assisting the &lt;a href=\"Ulrich%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg\"&gt;Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg&lt;/a&gt; to regain his traditional seat, from which Charles had removed him in 1519. Francis also obtained the help of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and after the death of &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20II%20Sforza\"&gt;Francesco II Sforza&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of Milan, renewed the contest in Italy in the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20War%20of%201536%E2%80%931538\"&gt;Italian War of 1536\u20131538&lt;/a&gt;. This round of fighting, which had little result, was ended by the &lt;a href=\"Truce%20of%20Nice\"&gt;Truce of Nice&lt;/a&gt;. The agreement collapsed, however, which led to Francis' final attempt on Italy in the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20War%20of%201542%E2%80%931546\"&gt;Italian War of 1542\u20131546&lt;/a&gt;. This time Francis managed to hold off the forces of Charles V and Henry VIII. Charles V was forced to sign the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Cr%C3%A9py\"&gt;Treaty of Cr\u00e9py&lt;/a&gt; because of his financial difficulties and conflicts with the &lt;a href=\"Schmalkaldic%20League\"&gt;Schmalkaldic League&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelations with the New World and Asia.\nFrancis had been much aggrieved at the &lt;a href=\"papal%20bull\"&gt;papal bull&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Aeterni%20regis\"&gt;Aeterni regis&lt;/a&gt;\": in June 1481 Portuguese rule over Africa and the Indies was confirmed by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Sixtus%20IV\"&gt;Pope Sixtus IV&lt;/a&gt;. Thirteen years later, on 7 June 1494, &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Crown of Castille&lt;/a&gt; signed the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Tordesillas\"&gt;Treaty of Tordesillas&lt;/a&gt; under which the newly discovered lands would be divided between the two signatories. All this prompted King Francis to declare, \"The sun shines for me as it does for others. I would very much like to see the clause of Adam\u2019s will by which I should be denied my share of the world.\"\nIn order to counterbalance the power of the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg%20Monarchy\"&gt;Habsburg Empire&lt;/a&gt; under Charles V, especially its control of large parts of the &lt;a href=\"New%20World\"&gt;New World&lt;/a&gt; through the Crown of Spain, Francis I endeavoured to develop contacts with the New World and Asia. Fleets were sent to the Americas and the Far East, and close contacts were developed with the Ottoman Empire permitting the development of French Mediterranean trade as well as the establishment of a strategic military alliance.\nThe port city now known as &lt;a href=\"Le%20Havre\"&gt;Le Havre&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1517 during the early years of Francis' reign. The construction of a new port was urgently needed in order to replace the ancient harbours of &lt;a href=\"Honfleur\"&gt;Honfleur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harfleur\"&gt;Harfleur&lt;/a&gt;, whose utility had decreased due to silting. Le Havre was originally named \"Franciscopolis\" after the King who founded it, but this name did not survive into later reigns.\nAmericas.\nIn 1524, Francis assisted the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; in financing the expedition of &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20da%20Verrazzano\"&gt;Giovanni da Verrazzano&lt;/a&gt; to North America. On this expedition, Verrazzano visited the present site of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, naming it &lt;a href=\"New%20Angoul%C3%AAme\"&gt;New Angoul\u00eame&lt;/a&gt;, and claimed &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20%28island%29\"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt; for the French crown. Verrazzano's letter to Francis of 8 July 1524 is known as the \"&lt;a href=\"C%C3%A8llere%20Codex\"&gt;C\u00e8llere Codex&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1531, &lt;a href=\"Bertrand%20d%27Ornesan\"&gt;Bertrand d'Ornesan&lt;/a&gt; tried to establish a French trading post at &lt;a href=\"Pernambuco\"&gt;Pernambuco&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil.\nIn 1534, Francis sent &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Cartier\"&gt;Jacques Cartier&lt;/a&gt; to explore the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Lawrence%20River\"&gt;St. Lawrence River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; to find \"certain islands and lands where it is said there must be great quantities of gold and other riches\". In 1541, Francis sent &lt;a href=\"Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Roberval\"&gt;Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Roberval&lt;/a&gt; to settle Canada and to provide for the spread of \"the Holy Catholic faith.\"\nFar East Asia.\nFrench trade with East Asia was initiated during the reign of Francis I with the help of shipowner &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Ango\"&gt;Jean Ango&lt;/a&gt;. In July 1527, a French &lt;a href=\"Normandy\"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt; trading ship from the city of &lt;a href=\"Rouen\"&gt;Rouen&lt;/a&gt; is recorded by the Portuguese &lt;a href=\"Jo%C3%A3o%20de%20Barros\"&gt;Jo\u00e3o de Barros&lt;/a&gt; as having arrived in the Indian city of &lt;a href=\"Diu%2C%20India\"&gt;Diu&lt;/a&gt;. In 1529, &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Parmentier%20%28explorer%29\"&gt;Jean Parmentier&lt;/a&gt;, on board the \"Sacre\" and the \"Pens\u00e9e\", reached &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. Upon its return, the expedition triggered the development of the &lt;a href=\"Dieppe%20maps\"&gt;Dieppe maps&lt;/a&gt;, influencing the work of &lt;a href=\"Dieppe%2C%20Seine-Maritime\"&gt;Dieppe&lt;/a&gt; cartographers such as &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Rotz\"&gt;Jean Rotz&lt;/a&gt;.\nOttoman Empire.\nUnder the reign of Francis I, France became the first country in Europe to establish formal relations with the Ottoman Empire and to set up instruction in the &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20language\"&gt;Arabic language&lt;/a&gt; under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Guillaume%20Postel\"&gt;Guillaume Postel&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20France\"&gt;Coll\u00e8ge de France&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a watershed moment in European diplomacy, Francis came to an understanding with the Ottoman Empire that developed into a &lt;a href=\"Franco-Ottoman%20alliance\"&gt;Franco-Ottoman alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The alliance has been called \"the first nonideological diplomatic alliance of its kind between a Christian and non-Christian empire\". It did, however, cause quite a scandal in the Christian world and was designated \"the impious alliance\", or \"the sacrilegious union of the [French]\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fleur-de-lis\"&gt;Lily&lt;/a&gt; and the [Ottoman]\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Star%20and%20crescent\"&gt;Crescent&lt;/a&gt;.\" Nevertheless, it endured for many years, since it served the objective interests of both parties. The two powers colluded against Charles V, and in 1543 they even combined for a joint naval assault in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Nice\"&gt;Siege of Nice&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1533, Francis I sent colonel &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20de%20Piton\"&gt;Pierre de Piton&lt;/a&gt; as ambassador to &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;, initiating official &lt;a href=\"France-Morocco%20relations\"&gt;France-Morocco relations&lt;/a&gt;. In a letter to Francis I dated 13 August 1533, the &lt;a href=\"Wattassid\"&gt;Wattassid&lt;/a&gt; ruler of &lt;a href=\"Fes\"&gt;Fez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abu%20al-Abbas%20Ahmad%20ibn%20Muhammad\"&gt;Ahmed ben Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;, welcomed French overtures and granted freedom of shipping and protection of French traders.\nBureaucratic reform and language policy.\nFrancis took several steps to eradicate the monopoly of &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; as the language of knowledge. In 1530, he declared French the national language of the kingdom, and that same year opened the Coll\u00e8ge des trois langues, or &lt;a href=\"Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20France\"&gt;Coll\u00e8ge Royal&lt;/a&gt;, following the recommendation of humanist &lt;a href=\"Guillaume%20Bud%C3%A9\"&gt;Guillaume Bud\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. Students at the Coll\u00e8ge could study &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hebrew\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aramaic\"&gt;Aramaic&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Guillaume%20Postel\"&gt;Guillaume Postel&lt;/a&gt; beginning in 1539.\nIn 1539, in his castle in &lt;a href=\"Villers-Cotter%C3%AAts\"&gt;Villers-Cotter\u00eats&lt;/a&gt;, Francis signed the important edict known as &lt;a href=\"Ordinance%20of%20Villers-Cotter%C3%AAts\"&gt;Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats&lt;/a&gt;, which, among other reforms, made French the administrative language of the kingdom as a replacement for &lt;a href=\"Latin%20language\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;. This same edict required priests to register births, marriages, and deaths, and to establish a registry office in every parish. This initiated the first records of vital statistics with filiations available in Europe.\nReligious policies.\nDivisions in &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; in Western Europe during Francis' reign created lasting international rifts. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther\"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt;'s preaching and writing sparked the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Protestant Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, which spread through much of Europe, including France.\nInitially Francis was relatively tolerant of the new movement, despite burning several heretics at the &lt;a href=\"Place%20Maubert\"&gt;Place Maubert&lt;/a&gt; in 1523. He was influenced by his beloved sister &lt;a href=\"Marguerite%20de%20Navarre\"&gt;Marguerite de Navarre&lt;/a&gt;, who was genuinely attracted by Luther's theology. Francis even considered it politically useful, as it caused many German princes to turn against his enemy Charles V. \nFrancis' attitude towards &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestantism&lt;/a&gt; changed for the worse following the \"&lt;a href=\"Affair%20of%20the%20Placards\"&gt;Affair of the Placards&lt;/a&gt;\", on the night of 17 October 1534, in which notices appeared on the streets of Paris and other major cities denouncing the Catholic &lt;a href=\"Mass%20%28Catholicism%29\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;. The most fervent Catholics were outraged by the notice's allegations. Francis himself came to view the movement as a plot against him and began to persecute its followers. Protestants were jailed and executed. In some areas whole villages were destroyed. In Paris, after 1540, Francis had heretics such as &lt;a href=\"Etienne%20Dolet\"&gt;Etienne Dolet&lt;/a&gt; tortured and burned. &lt;a href=\"Printing\"&gt;Printing&lt;/a&gt; was censored and leading &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20reformers\"&gt;Protestant reformers&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"John%20Calvin\"&gt;John Calvin&lt;/a&gt; were forced into exile. The persecutions soon numbered thousands of dead and tens of thousands of homeless.\nPersecutions against Protestants were codified in the &lt;a href=\"Edict%20of%20Fontainebleau%20%281540%29\"&gt;Edict of Fontainebleau (1540)&lt;/a&gt; issued by Francis. Major acts of violence continued, as when Francis ordered the execution of one of the historical pre-Lutheran groups, the &lt;a href=\"Waldensians\"&gt;Waldensians&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Massacre%20of%20M%C3%A9rindol\"&gt;Massacre of M\u00e9rindol&lt;/a&gt; in 1545.\nDeath.\nFrancis died at the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Rambouillet\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet&lt;/a&gt; on 31 March 1547, on his son and successor's 28th birthday. It is said that \"he died complaining about the weight of a crown that he had first perceived as a gift from God\". He was interred with his first wife, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Denis%20Basilica\"&gt;Saint Denis Basilica&lt;/a&gt;. He was succeeded by his son, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20France\"&gt;Henry II&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrancis' tomb and that of his wife and mother, along with the tombs of other French kings and members of the royal family, were desecrated on 20 October 1793 during the &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Reign of Terror&lt;/a&gt; at the height of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nImage and reputation.\nFrancis I has a poor reputation in France\u2014his 500th anniversary was little noted in 1994. Popular and scholarly historical memory ignores his building of so many fine chateaux, his stunning art collection, his lavish patronage of scholars and artists. He is seen as a playboy who disgraced France by allowing himself to be defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. The historian &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Michelet\"&gt;Jules Michelet&lt;/a&gt; set the negative image.\nFrancis' personal emblem was the &lt;a href=\"Salamander%20%28legendary%20creature%29\"&gt;salamander&lt;/a&gt; and his Latin motto was \"Nutrisco et extinguo\" (\"I nourish [the good] and extinguish [the bad]\"). His long nose earned him the nickname \"Fran\u00e7ois du Grand Nez\" (\"Francis of the Big Nose\"), he was also colloquially known as the \"Grand Colas\" or \"Bonhomme Colas\". For his personal involvement in battles, he was known as \"le Roi-Chevalier\" (\"the Knight-King\") or \"le Roi-Guerrier\" (\"the Warrior-King\").\nBritish historian Glenn Richardson considers Francis a success:\nMarriage and issue.\nOn 18 May 1514, Francis married his second cousin &lt;a href=\"Claude%20of%20France\"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XII%20of%20France\"&gt;King Louis XII of France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anne%20of%20Brittany\"&gt;Duchess Anne of Brittany&lt;/a&gt;. The couple had seven children:\nOn 7 July 1530, Francis I married his second wife &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Eleanor of Austria&lt;/a&gt;, \na sister of the Emperor Charles V. The couple had no children. During his reign, Francis kept two official mistresses at court. The first was &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7oise%20de%20Foix\"&gt;Fran\u00e7oise de Foix&lt;/a&gt;, Countess of &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teaubriant\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teaubriant&lt;/a&gt;. In 1526, she was replaced by the blonde-haired, cultured &lt;a href=\"Anne%20de%20Pisseleu%20d%27Heilly\"&gt;Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly&lt;/a&gt;, Duchess of \u00c9tampes, who with the death of Queen Claude two years earlier, wielded far more political power at court than her predecessor had done. Another of his earlier mistresses was allegedly &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Boleyn\"&gt;Mary Boleyn&lt;/a&gt;, mistress of King &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; and sister of Henry's future wife, &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Boleyn\"&gt;Anne Boleyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrancis I in films, stage and literature.\nThe amorous exploits of Francis inspired the 1832 play by &lt;a href=\"Fanny%20Kemble\"&gt;Fanny Kemble&lt;/a&gt;, \"Francis the First\", and the 1832 play by &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Hugo\"&gt;Victor Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Roi%20s%27amuse\"&gt;Le Roi s'amuse&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The King's Amusement\"), which featured the jester &lt;a href=\"Triboulet\"&gt;Triboulet&lt;/a&gt;, the inspiration for the 1851 opera \"&lt;a href=\"Rigoletto%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Rigoletto&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Verdi\"&gt;Giuseppe Verdi&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrancis was first played in a &lt;a href=\"George%20M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s\"&gt;George M\u00e9li\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt; movie by an unknown actor in 1907, and has also been played by Claude Garry (1910), &lt;a href=\"Aim%C3%A9%20Simon-Girard\"&gt;Aim\u00e9 Simon-Girard&lt;/a&gt; (1937), &lt;a href=\"Sacha%20Guitry\"&gt;Sacha Guitry&lt;/a&gt; (1937), &lt;a href=\"G%C3%A9rard%20Oury\"&gt;G\u00e9rard Oury&lt;/a&gt; (1953), &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Marais\"&gt;Jean Marais&lt;/a&gt; (1955), &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Armend%C3%A1riz\"&gt;Pedro Armend\u00e1riz&lt;/a&gt; (1956), &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Titre\"&gt;Claude Titre&lt;/a&gt; (1962), Bernard Pierre Donnadieu (1990). &lt;a href=\"Timothy%20West\"&gt;Timothy West&lt;/a&gt; (1998) and &lt;a href=\"Emmanuel%20Leconte\"&gt;Emmanuel Leconte&lt;/a&gt; (2007\u2013 2010).\nFrancis was portrayed by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Gilmore\"&gt;Peter Gilmore&lt;/a&gt; in the comedy film \"&lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20Henry\"&gt;Carry On Henry&lt;/a&gt;\" charting the fictitious two extra wives of Henry VIII (including Marie cousin of King Francis).\nFrancis receives a mention in a minor story in &lt;a href=\"Laurence%20Sterne\"&gt;Laurence Sterne&lt;/a&gt;'s novel \"&lt;a href=\"Tristram%20Shandy\"&gt;Tristram Shandy&lt;/a&gt;\". The narrator claims that the king, wishing to win the favour of Switzerland, offers to make the country the godmother of his son. When, however, their choice of name conflicts, he declares war.\nHe is also mentioned in Jean de la Br\u00e8te's novel \"Reine \u2013 Mon oncle et mon cur\u00e9\", where the main character Reine de Lavalle idolises him after reading his biography, much to the dismay of the local priest.\nHe often receives mentions in novels on the lives of either of the Boleyn sisters \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Boleyn\"&gt;Mary Boleyn&lt;/a&gt; (d. 1543) and her sister, Queen &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Boleyn\"&gt;Anne Boleyn&lt;/a&gt; (executed 1536), both of whom were for a time educated at his court. Mary had, according to several accounts, been Francis' one-time mistress and Anne had been a favourite of his sister: the novels \"The Lady in the Tower\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Other%20Boleyn%20Girl\"&gt;The Other Boleyn Girl&lt;/a&gt;,\" \"The Last Boleyn\", \"Dear Heart, How Like You This?\" and \"Mademoiselle Boleyn\" feature Francis in their story. He appears in &lt;a href=\"Hilary%20Mantel\"&gt;Hilary Mantel&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Wolf Hall\" about Henry VIII's minister &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Cromwell\"&gt;Thomas Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; and is often referred to in its sequel, \"Bring Up the Bodies\".\nFrancis is portrayed in Diane Haeger's novel \"Courtesan\" about Diane de Poitiers and Henri II.\nFrancis appears as the patron of &lt;a href=\"Benvenuto%20Cellini\"&gt;Benvenuto Cellini&lt;/a&gt; in the 1843 French novel \"L'Orf\u00e8vre du roi, ou Ascanio\" by &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Dumas%2C%20p%C3%A8re\"&gt;Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Shellabarger\"&gt;Samuel Shellabarger&lt;/a&gt;'s novel \"The King's Cavalier\" describes Francis the man, and the cultural and political circumstances of his reign, in some detail.\nHe was a recurring character in the highly inaccurate Showtime series \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tudors\"&gt;The Tudors&lt;/a&gt;\", opposite &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Rhys%20Meyers\"&gt;Jonathan Rhys Meyers&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Dormer\"&gt;Natalie Dormer&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Boleyn\"&gt;Anne Boleyn&lt;/a&gt;. Francis is played by French actor, Emmanuel Leconte.\nHe and his court set the scene for &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Schiller\"&gt;Friedrich Schiller&lt;/a&gt;'s ballad \"&lt;a href=\"Der%20Handschuh\"&gt;Der Handschuh&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Glove\").\nFrancis I (played by &lt;a href=\"Timothy%20West\"&gt;Timothy West&lt;/a&gt;) and Francis's son Henry II (played by &lt;a href=\"Dougray%20Scott\"&gt;Dougray Scott&lt;/a&gt;) are central figures in the 1998 movie \"&lt;a href=\"Ever%20After\"&gt;Ever After&lt;/a&gt;\", a retelling of the &lt;a href=\"Cinderella\"&gt;Cinderella&lt;/a&gt; story. The plot includes &lt;a href=\"Leonardo%20da%20Vinci\"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt; (played by &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Godfrey\"&gt;Patrick Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;) arriving at Francis's court with the \"&lt;a href=\"Mona%20Lisa\"&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe is played by &lt;a href=\"Alfonso%20Bassave\"&gt;Alfonso Bassave&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Televisi%C3%B3n%20Espa%C3%B1ola\"&gt;TVE&lt;/a&gt; series \"&lt;a href=\"Carlos%2C%20rey%20emperador\"&gt;Carlos, rey emperador&lt;/a&gt;\", opposite &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lvaro%20Cervantes\"&gt;\u00c1lvaro Cervantes&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt;."
