    "text": "Le roi de Lahore (\"The king of &lt;a href=\"Lahore\"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt;\") is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; in five acts by &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Massenet\"&gt;Jules Massenet&lt;/a&gt; to a French &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Gallet\"&gt;Louis Gallet&lt;/a&gt;. It was first performed at the &lt;a href=\"Palais%20Garnier\"&gt;Palais Garnier&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; on 27 April 1877 in costumes designed by Eug\u00e8ne Lacoste and settings designed by Jean \u00c9mile Daran (Act I, scene 1), &lt;a href=\"Auguste%20Alfred%20Rub%C3%A9\"&gt;Auguste Alfred Rub\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20Chaperon\"&gt;Philippe Chaperon&lt;/a&gt; (Act I, scene 2; Act V), Louis Ch\u00e9ret (Act II), &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Lavastre\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Lavastre&lt;/a&gt; (Act III), Antoine Lavastre and &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20Louis%20Carpezat\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne Louis Carpezat&lt;/a&gt; (Act IV).\n\"Le roi de Lahore\" is Massenet's third extant opera and was his first major success in Paris, spawning performances across Europe and leading to his place as one of the most popular &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt;s of his time.\nPerformance history.\nWithin a year of the premiere the opera was performed, for instance, in &lt;a href=\"Turin\"&gt;Turin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bologna\"&gt;Bologna&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Royal Opera House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Covent%20Garden\"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt;, presented it in London in 1879, and in 1906 it premiered in &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Carlo\"&gt;Monte Carlo&lt;/a&gt;. The US premiere took place in 1883 at the &lt;a href=\"French%20Opera%20House\"&gt;French Opera House&lt;/a&gt; in New Orleans.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt; premiere in 1924, however, \"Le roi de Lahore\" in particular, and Massenet's style of romantic opera in general, faded in fashion so much that it received only six performances and has never been revived there since.\nContemporary performances include a revival by the &lt;a href=\"Vancouver%20Opera\"&gt;Vancouver Opera&lt;/a&gt; in 1977 starring &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Sutherland\"&gt;Joan Sutherland&lt;/a&gt; and conducted by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Bonynge\"&gt;Richard Bonynge&lt;/a&gt;. The same production was mounted at the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Opera\"&gt;San Francisco Opera&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently recorded. A more recent revival occurred at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20La%20Fenice\"&gt;Teatro La Fenice&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 under the baton of &lt;a href=\"Marcello%20Viotti\"&gt;Marcello Viotti&lt;/a&gt;, a performance of which was released on CD and DVD.\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\nThe citizens of Lahore gather at the temple to pray for divine protection against the Moslem invaders, and receive encouragement from Timour, the high priest. Scindia, minister of King Alim is in love with Sita, his niece, who is also a priestess at the temple. Scindia asks Timour to release Sita from her vows, and points out that she has been meeting a young man.\nIn Indra's sanctuary, Scindia gets Sita to admit her interest in this young stranger, but she refuses to name him; Scindia accuses her of sacrilege, and the priests demand that she sing the evening prayer to lure the young man. A secret door opens and a young man appears: it is King Alim who confesses his love and asks for Sita's hand in marriage. Timour demands that the king expiate his actions by leading his army against the Muslims. Scindia schemes to arrange an ambush and kill the king.\nAct 2.\nAt the king's encampment, where Sita has followed and pitched camp near the king as she awaits his return from the fighting, resolved to declare her love for him. The soldiers have been routed. Scindia gets them to join with him to usurp the throne. Alim enters, wounded, and realizes that Scindia must have betrayed him, he dies in Sita's arms. Scindia returns and triumphs over Alim's body; he declares himself the king and leaves for Lahore with Sita prisoner.\nAct 3.\nThere are songs and dances by the &lt;a href=\"apsara\"&gt;apsara&lt;/a&gt;s. Alim\u2019s soul arrives but he admits to Indra that he misses the presence of Sita. Indra takes pity and agrees to restore Alim to life \u2013 as the humblest of beings \u2013 for as long as Sita lives, after which they will both die together; Alim happily agrees.\nAct 4.\nSita laments her fate and begs Indra to re-unite her with Alim. Fanfares announce the approach of Scindia, and she renounces the crown, praying for death.\nAlim awakens back in Lahore at the entrance to the royal palace where the crowd is gathering for Scindia's coronation. Scindia enters, on his way to persuade Sita to marry him, but a vengeful vision blocks his path. Alim appears to the onlookers like a poor madman, and is ordered to be seized, but Timour says that he must be a visionary inspired by god. As Sita's palanquin enters, Scindia welcomes her as his queen.\nAct 5.\nSita has sought refuge in Indra's sanctuary having fled forced marriage with Scindia. Alim is admitted to the sanctuary by Timour and the lovers meet again. Scindia arrives and threatens them both; Sita stabs herself and at once Alim again becomes a spirit, thus foiling the designs of Scindia. The temple walls change into a vision of paradise and Sita and Alim are united in celestial happiness, while Scindia falls to the ground in terror."
