    "title": "Mercedes Gleitze",
    "text": "Mercedes Carey (n\u00e9e Gleitze; 18 November 1900 \u2013 9 February 1981) was a British professional swimmer. She was the first person to swim the &lt;a href=\"Straits%20of%20Gibraltar\"&gt;Straits of Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt; and the first British woman to &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20successful%20English%20Channel%20swimmers\"&gt;swim the English Channel&lt;/a&gt;. The name of Mercedes Gleitze was used to market &lt;a href=\"Rolex\"&gt;Rolex&lt;/a&gt;'s new waterproof case, the \"Oyster\". She established endurance records for swimming including a record of 46 hours in 1932. She was able to raise funds to found the Mercedes Gleitze Homes in &lt;a href=\"Leicester\"&gt;Leicester&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"sponsorship\"&gt;sponsorship&lt;/a&gt;. The Mercedes Gleitze charity is now linked to the Family Action charity.\nEarly life.\nMercedes Gleitze was born to Heinrich and Anna (born Kurr) Gleitze in 1900 in the English south-coastal town of &lt;a href=\"Brighton\"&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt;. She and her two elder sisters came from German heritage and Mercedes spent time with her grandparents in &lt;a href=\"Herzogenaurach\"&gt;Herzogenaurach&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; and two years studying at the Maria Stern Convent School in &lt;a href=\"N%C3%B6rdlingen\"&gt;N\u00f6rdlingen&lt;/a&gt;. Her father was a German immigrant from the county of &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6ttingen\"&gt;G\u00f6ttingen&lt;/a&gt;. He was a baker and her mother taught languages.\nSwimming achievements.\nWith her &lt;a href=\"bilingual\"&gt;bilingual&lt;/a&gt; background and education Gleitze became a secretary and &lt;a href=\"stenographer\"&gt;stenographer&lt;/a&gt; in central London exploiting her talent for languages. In her spare time she started swimming in the &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt;. Her first significant record was for 10 hr 45 min she spent swimming in the Thames. This was the longest time for a woman in 1923. She attracted attention when, at the eighth attempt, she became the first English woman to swim the &lt;a href=\"English%20Channel\"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt;, on 7 October 1927. The record was in doubt when in the following days another woman, Dr. Dorothy Cochrane Logan (using her professional name, Mona McLennan), claimed to have swum the channel faster. Her version of events proved to be a fabrication but the effect of this &lt;a href=\"hoax\"&gt;hoax&lt;/a&gt; undermined Gleitze's claim.\nUnder pressure from the media she agreed to undertake a \"vindication swim\" even though the water was much colder than when Channel swimming is normally attempted. Gleitze failed to complete the swim but her endurance of the cold convinced all that the original record should stand. Gleitze made not only her name but also that of Rolex's Oyster watch. The watch withstood her second swim and this was used to launch an advertising campaign in Britain. Rolex still uses Gleitze's name in their publicity.\nGleitze was sponsored for these record attempts and in 1928 she was able to open the first Mercedes Gleitze Home in 1933. This was a large house in &lt;a href=\"Leicester\"&gt;Leicester&lt;/a&gt; that was converted into flats for homeless families. She was supported in her work by the &lt;a href=\"Rotary%20Club\"&gt;Rotary Club&lt;/a&gt; which was undertaking a scheme to move unemployed people from the north of England to Leicester where they could find work. Gleitze continued to break records and she became the first person to swim the &lt;a href=\"Straits%20of%20Gibraltar\"&gt;Straits of Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt; between Europe and Africa.\nGleitze travelled to &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; to establish new records for swimming. Besides swimming the 100 miles around the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/a&gt; and becoming the first person to swim to &lt;a href=\"Robben%20Island\"&gt;Robben Island&lt;/a&gt; and back to &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; she also staged feats of endurance swimming.\nWhen she first took the endurance swimming record it stood at 26 hours. Over several years she extended this record in public swimming baths where crowds would attend and encourage her by singing together.\nGleitze married engineer Patrick Carey in &lt;a href=\"Dover\"&gt;Dover&lt;/a&gt; in 1930 with the American swimming &lt;a href=\"twins\"&gt;twins&lt;/a&gt; Bernice and Phyllis Zittenfeld as &lt;a href=\"bridesmaid\"&gt;bridesmaid&lt;/a&gt;s. The ceremony was covered by British newsreels where Gleitze announced that she was off to swim the &lt;a href=\"Dardanelles\"&gt;Hellespont&lt;/a&gt; instead of going on &lt;a href=\"honeymoon\"&gt;honeymoon&lt;/a&gt;. Gleitze continued to extend her endurance record to 45 hours the following year. In 1932 she retired after again extending the record finally to 46 hours.\nEndorsements.\nGleitze gathered a large number of companies who were keen to be associated with her achievements. Consumers were asked to toast her with &lt;a href=\"Paddy%20Whiskey\"&gt;Paddy Whiskey&lt;/a&gt; when they were not drinking Lipton's Tea which had reputedly helped her \"beat the channel\". She appeared at a corset demonstration for Kellett's and at the showing of the, now lost, 1927 silent film \"&lt;a href=\"Swim%20Girl%2C%20Swim\"&gt;Swim Girl, Swim&lt;/a&gt;\" which starred &lt;a href=\"Bebe%20Daniels\"&gt;Bebe Daniels&lt;/a&gt; and a fellow swimmer &lt;a href=\"Gertrude%20Ederle\"&gt;Gertrude Ederle&lt;/a&gt;. There were unproductive rumours that Gleitze might star in a film. Gleitze also recommended Be-ze-be &lt;a href=\"honey\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; and bathing caps as well as her enduring role as a brand ambassador for &lt;a href=\"Rolex\"&gt;Rolex&lt;/a&gt; watches.\nCelebrity.\nGleitze became a celebrity and she was regularly the subject of stories. The newspaper that most adopted a tabloid approach to her was the \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Mirror\"&gt;Daily Mirror&lt;/a&gt;\" that hinted that Gleitze was using her charity's funds inappropriately. The paper challenged the charity to allow its accounts to be audited and offered to pay for the cost. The papers also reported on believed or invented stories of rivalry between Gleitze and other swimmers. &lt;a href=\"Millie%20Hudson\"&gt;Millie Hudson&lt;/a&gt; who went with her to Gibraltar was said to be a rival and Gleitze was said to have annoyed Lottie Shoemmell who was an American swimmer by refusing to race her across the Channel.\nLater life.\nAfter her retirement from swimming Gleitze became a housewife, had three children, and became increasingly reclusive, lying about her past to her neighbours and not discussing her achievements with her family. She died aged 80, on 9 February 1981, in a hospital in London.\nLegacy.\nBesides her three children and many swimming records Gleitze founded several homes that were used by homeless British people during the 1930s. In 1939 they were used for homeless &lt;a href=\"Czech%20people\"&gt;Czech people&lt;/a&gt;. The buildings were destroyed in &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; bombing in 1940, however an organisation continues to administer her charity and it continues Gleitze's desire to alleviate the effects of homelessness.\nRolex still use Gleitze's achievement (2010) in their publicity. In 2010 the Rolex company was running adverts featuring swimming the channel, their watch, and the figure of a woman in a swimming costume. The advert does not mention Gleitze, nor does it mention that she did not complete a Channel swim whilst wearing the watch. The advert shows the swimmer wearing the watch on her wrist although when Gleitze attempted to carry the watch across the Channel she had it tied around her neck.\nIn 2022 the film \"&lt;a href=\"Vindication%20Swim\"&gt;Vindication Swim&lt;/a&gt;\", about Gleitze's 1927 English Channel swim, was released. It was written and directed by &lt;a href=\"Elliott%20Hasler\"&gt;Elliott Hasler&lt;/a&gt;, and starred &lt;a href=\"Kirsten%20Callaghan\"&gt;Kirsten Callaghan&lt;/a&gt; as Gleitze.\nIn January 2022 a &lt;a href=\"blue%20plaque\"&gt;blue plaque&lt;/a&gt; for Gleitze was unveiled at her birthplace in Freshfield Road, Brighton."
