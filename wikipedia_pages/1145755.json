It focuses on &lt;a href=\"classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Radio%20documentary\"&gt;documentaries and features&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"News%20broadcasting\"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Radio%20drama\"&gt;radio plays&lt;/a&gt; and dramas, \"&lt;a href=\"Kabarett\"&gt;Kabarett&lt;/a&gt;\", quiz shows, and discussions.\nHistory.\nThe channel was launched on 1 October 1967 as part of an exercise which saw the ORF's radio output reorganized into three numbered services, the other two being the regional stations grouped as &lt;a href=\"%C3%962\"&gt;\u00d62&lt;/a&gt; and the pop music channel &lt;a href=\"Hitradio%20%C3%963\"&gt;\u00d63&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarlier, in 1964, there had been a petition for a national &lt;a href=\"referendum\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt;, whereby more than 800,000 citizens declared themselves against ideological appointments of key positions within the public broadcasting service by the Austrian &lt;a href=\"grand%20coalition\"&gt;grand coalition&lt;/a&gt; government of Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Alfons%20Gorbach\"&gt;Alfons Gorbach&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"%C3%96VP\"&gt;\u00d6VP&lt;/a&gt;) and Vice-Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Bruno%20Pittermann\"&gt;Bruno Pittermann&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"SP%C3%96\"&gt;SP\u00d6&lt;/a&gt;) according to the Austrian \"&lt;a href=\"Proporz\"&gt;Proporz&lt;/a&gt;\" system. Two years later, a legal regulation of a nonpartisan broadcasting was passed by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Council%20%28Austria%29\"&gt;National Council&lt;/a&gt; parliament, entailing a relaunch of the ORF radio stations.\n\u00d61 was designated to comply with the public educational mandate (\"Bildungsauftrag\") and to offer a broadly cultural program for an artistically inclined audience. One focus is on news broadcasts like the one-hour \"Mittagsjournal\" (\"Noon Journal\") and \"Morgenjournal\" (\"Morning Journal\"), launched in the course of the coverage of the 1968 &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Spring\"&gt;Prague Spring&lt;/a&gt;. Beside established programmes such as \"Du holde Kunst\", first aired in 1945, \u00d61 since the 1970s has also broadcast &lt;a href=\"Radio%20documentary\"&gt;radio documentaries&lt;/a&gt; (\"H\u00f6rbilder\"), music programmes beyond the strictly classical canon (\"Pasticcio\", \"Spielr\u00e4ume\"), and several recurring reports on &lt;a href=\"everyday%20life\"&gt;everyday life&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"feuilleton\"&gt;feuilleton&lt;/a&gt; style like \"Der Schalld\u00e4mpfer\" by &lt;a href=\"Axel%20Corti\"&gt;Axel Corti&lt;/a&gt; (discontinued upon his death in 1993). Similar to other classical music radio stations, \u00d61 has to bear with the tension between an elitist \"\"&lt;a href=\"Geheimrat\"&gt;Hofrat&lt;/a&gt;\" widow broadcaster\" and a \"Classic FM\" popularisation, with the station's style and scheduling a matter of ongoing debates.\nOperation.\n\u00d61 broadcasts from Funkhaus Wien on Argentinierstrasse in the &lt;a href=\"Wieden\"&gt;Wieden&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;. The current &lt;a href=\"station%20identification\"&gt;station identification&lt;/a&gt; was composed by the jazz musician &lt;a href=\"Werner%20Pirchner\"&gt;Werner Pirchner&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, the &lt;a href=\"slogan\"&gt;slogan&lt;/a&gt; \"\u00d61 geh\u00f6rt geh\u00f6rt\"\u2014a pun on \"to be heard\" in German conforming with \"ought to\"\u2014was created by the author &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Haas\"&gt;Wolf Haas&lt;/a&gt;. The interval signal of \u00d61 is a three-note chord, played on a viola. There were two earlier versions of the signal: first one was played by harpsichord and the second one by a synth.\nSince 2010 a 75-minute altered block of programming is broadcast every morning on the &lt;a href=\"Shortwave%20radio\"&gt;shortwave&lt;/a&gt; frequencies of former &lt;a href=\"Radio%20%C3%96sterreich%20International\"&gt;Radio \u00d6sterreich International&lt;/a&gt; as \u00d61 International. \u00d61 &lt;a href=\"internet%20radio\"&gt;internet radio&lt;/a&gt; can also be listened to live on the ORF website through &lt;a href=\"streaming%20media\"&gt;streaming audio&lt;/a&gt;, the programmes can also be heard for a week after broadcast at no charge. Several are available as &lt;a href=\"download\"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"podcast\"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\u00d61 runs the RadioKulturhaus venue in Funkhaus Wien including the KulturCaf\u00e9 &lt;a href=\"Viennese%20coffee%20house\"&gt;coffee house&lt;/a&gt;. It also participates in the annual &lt;a href=\"Donauinselfest\"&gt;Donauinselfest&lt;/a&gt; music festival."
