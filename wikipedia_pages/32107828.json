    "text": "The 2011\u201312 season was &lt;a href=\"Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.\"&gt;Plymouth Argyle&lt;/a&gt;'s 100th as a professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club, their 87th as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; and their sixth in &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Two\"&gt;Football League Two&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth tier of the &lt;a href=\"English%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;English football league system&lt;/a&gt;. The season marked Argyle's 125th anniversary since founding in 1886.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2010\u201311 season&lt;/a&gt; was the club's 39th in the third tier of the English football league system, having been relegated from the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Championship\"&gt;Football League Championship&lt;/a&gt; the previous season. It was their first campaign at that level for six years and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Reid\"&gt;Peter Reid&lt;/a&gt;'s first season in charge since becoming the club's manager. Argyle began the season by picking up four points from their opening two matches, but they struggled for consistency over the next two months, winning four of their next 15 league matches. The club was firmly established in mid-table when they received a winding-up petition from &lt;a href=\"HM%20Revenue%20%26amp%3B%20Customs\"&gt;HM Revenue &amp; Customs&lt;/a&gt; over unpaid taxes in November, the third in the space of a year. A number of players were sold in January to raise funds, including top goalscorer &lt;a href=\"Bradley%20Wright-Phillips\"&gt;Bradley Wright-Phillips&lt;/a&gt;, midfielder &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Noone\"&gt;Craig Noone&lt;/a&gt; and defender &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9da%20Johnson\"&gt;R\u00e9da Johnson&lt;/a&gt; for six-figure fees. As a result, the team's form dipped and they lost nine of their next ten matches. The club was docked ten points by the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; in February for issuing a notice of intention to appoint an administrator, which left Argyle bottom of the table.\nTwo weeks later, the club's directors put the club into administration. The team won six of their next 11 matches, but relegation to &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Two\"&gt;League Two&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed at the start of May in their penultimate match of the season. Argyle finished 23rd in the league table, having taken 42 points from 46 matches. They finished above &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt;, but were six points below &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20F.C.\"&gt;Walsall&lt;/a&gt;, who stayed up on the last day of the season. Having been in negotiations over a takeover with interested parties, nine first team players out of contract at the end of June were released by the club. They included defenders &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Seip\"&gt;Marcel Seip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kriszti%C3%A1n%20Tim%C3%A1r\"&gt;Kriszti\u00e1n Tim\u00e1r&lt;/a&gt;, Scottish players &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Clark%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201980%29\"&gt;Chris Clark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20MacLean%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Steve MacLean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Paterson%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Jim Paterson&lt;/a&gt;, midfielders &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Peterlin%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;Anton Peterlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Summerfield\"&gt;Luke Summerfield&lt;/a&gt;, forward &lt;a href=\"Rory%20Fallon\"&gt;Rory Fallon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Duguid\"&gt;Karl Duguid&lt;/a&gt;. The only player to be offered a new contract was Frenchman &lt;a href=\"St%C3%A9phane%20Zubar\"&gt;St\u00e9phane Zubar&lt;/a&gt;, while captain &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Fletcher%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29\"&gt;Carl Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; agreed to stay by taking up the option of a further 12 months on his deal. First year professional &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Leonard\"&gt;Ryan Leonard&lt;/a&gt; was also released, and among the apprentices that were allowed to leave was &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Rickard\"&gt;Matt Rickard&lt;/a&gt;, who made one appearance for the first team in 2010\u201311. In June, &lt;a href=\"Yannick%20Bolasie\"&gt;Yannick Bolasie&lt;/a&gt; was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A1ri%20%C3%81rnason%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201982%29\"&gt;K\u00e1ri \u00c1rnason&lt;/a&gt; was released after refusing to sign a wage deferral.\nReview.\nPre-season.\nThe squad returned for pre-season training on 4 July. They were joined by defenders &lt;a href=\"Durrell%20Berry\"&gt;Durrell Berry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robbie%20Williams%20%28footballer%20born%201984%29\"&gt;Robbie Williams&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to join the club having been released by &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rochdale%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Rochdale&lt;/a&gt; respectively at the end of last season, and two trialists; former &lt;a href=\"Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Oldham Athletic&lt;/a&gt; forward &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Crompton\"&gt;Andy Crompton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Norwich City&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Daley\"&gt;Luke Daley&lt;/a&gt;. Later that day, defender &lt;a href=\"Bondz%20N%27Gala\"&gt;Bondz N'Gala&lt;/a&gt; completed a transfer to &lt;a href=\"Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Yeovil Town&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Dickinson\"&gt;Liam Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"Barnsley%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnsley&lt;/a&gt; striker, joined the squad on 5 July after agreeing to join the club on a free transfer. On 10 July, forward &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Mason%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201991%29\"&gt;Joe Mason&lt;/a&gt; joined &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Cardiff City&lt;/a&gt; for an undisclosed fee. Two more trialists took part in training the next day; goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Cole\"&gt;Jake Cole&lt;/a&gt; and French defender &lt;a href=\"Ladjie%20Soukouna\"&gt;Ladjie Soukouna&lt;/a&gt;, while youngsters Jamie Richards and &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Young%20%28footballer%20born%201993%29\"&gt;Luke Young&lt;/a&gt; signed their first professional contracts. Reid chose against pursuing his interest in Crompton. Argyle began their schedule of nine pre-season &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20game\"&gt;friendlies&lt;/a&gt; by defeating &lt;a href=\"South%20West%20Peninsula%20League\"&gt;South West Peninsula League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Torpoint%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Torpoint Athletic&lt;/a&gt; by two goals to one on 12 July. Winger &lt;a href=\"Jed%20Harper-Penman\"&gt;Jed Harper-Penman&lt;/a&gt; scored both goals for a young Argyle team.\nThe contract of Dickinson was cancelled the next day for personal reasons. Argyle faced &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Championship\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol City&lt;/a&gt; at Home Park on 15 July. Included in the team were three more trialists; former &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20F.C.\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Kiernan%20Hughes-Mason\"&gt;Kiernan Hughes-Mason&lt;/a&gt;, Rochdale forward &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Elding\"&gt;Anthony Elding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackburn Rovers&lt;/a&gt; striker &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Hitchcock\"&gt;Tom Hitchcock&lt;/a&gt;. The visitors won 3\u20132, with Hughes-Mason and Hitchcock scoring for Argyle. A team made up solely of the club's youth system played &lt;a href=\"Western%20Football%20League\"&gt;Western League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Barnstaple%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnstaple Town&lt;/a&gt; the next day. A &lt;a href=\"2%20%28number%29%23In%20other%20fields\"&gt;brace&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Lecointe\"&gt;Matt Lecointe&lt;/a&gt; and further goals from Tyler Harvey and Ben Clarvis earned a 4\u20134 draw for the away side. Northern Irish forward &lt;a href=\"Rory%20Patterson\"&gt;Rory Patterson&lt;/a&gt; left the club later in the day to join &lt;a href=\"Linfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Linfield&lt;/a&gt; on loan until the end of the season. Four new trialists joined the squad on 18 July; Argentine winger Andr\u00e9s Gurrieri, former &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Birmingham City&lt;/a&gt; youngsters Gerard Kinsella and Shane Williams, and former &lt;a href=\"Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.\"&gt;Preston North End&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Whaley\"&gt;Simon Whaley&lt;/a&gt;, while Hughes-Mason was allowed to leave. St\u00e9phane Zubar returned to the club on 19 July after accepting the offer of a new contract.\nTerms were agreed with trialists Daley and Soukouna, and an agreement was reached with Blackburn Rovers to sign Hitchcock on loan for three months. Midfielder &lt;a href=\"Damien%20Johnson\"&gt;Damien Johnson&lt;/a&gt; completed a return to &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Huddersfield Town&lt;/a&gt; on a season-long loan, while former &lt;a href=\"Barnet%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnet&lt;/a&gt; player Cole agreed to sign. &lt;a href=\"Romain%20Larrieu\"&gt;Romain Larrieu&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"testimonial%20match\"&gt;testimonial match&lt;/a&gt; took place on 20 July 2011 against &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Queens Park Rangers&lt;/a&gt;. Argyle lost 1\u20130 in an even contest at Home Park. Two days later, a young team defeated local South West Peninsula League side &lt;a href=\"Elburton%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Elburton Villa&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131 at Haye Road, with LeCointe, &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Vassell\"&gt;Isaac Vassell&lt;/a&gt; and Harvey scoring for Argyle. Three trialists joined the squad on 25 July: French striker &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Mendes\"&gt;Joseph Mendes&lt;/a&gt;, and midfielders Joe Holt and &lt;a href=\"Conor%20Hourihane\"&gt;Conor Hourihane&lt;/a&gt;, while Elding, Whaley and Shane Williams departed. A &lt;a href=\"hat-trick\"&gt;hat-trick&lt;/a&gt; from LeCointe earned a youthful Argyle side a 3\u20133 draw at &lt;a href=\"Western%20Football%20League\"&gt;Western League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Bridport%20F.C.\"&gt;Bridport&lt;/a&gt; on 26 July.\nThe next day, &lt;a href=\"Conference%20South\"&gt;Conference South&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Truro%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Truro City&lt;/a&gt; were defeated 2\u20131 at Home Park, with Fletcher and Hourihane scoring the goals for the hosts. Goals from Mendes and youth team player Colin Watson helped Argyle defeat &lt;a href=\"Tavistock%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Tavistock&lt;/a&gt; of the South West Peninsula League by three goals to one at Langsford Park on 29 July; the third was an &lt;a href=\"own%20goal\"&gt;own goal&lt;/a&gt;. Hourihane joined the club permanently the next day, signing from &lt;a href=\"Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Ipswich Town&lt;/a&gt; on a free transfer. Holt, Mendes and &lt;a href=\"Nikolaj%20Misiuk\"&gt;Nikolaj Misiuk&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;n striker who had played against Tavistock, were informed that they would not be offered contracts. Kinsella's trial was ended due to a knee injury that required surgery. Argyle defeated South West Peninsula League side &lt;a href=\"Saltash%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Saltash United&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in their final pre-season friendly at Kimberly Stadium on 1 August. The only goal of the game was scored by Hitchcock. &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; defender &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Gibson%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Ben Gibson&lt;/a&gt; joined the club on loan for three months. Northern Ireland international &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Feeney\"&gt;Warren Feeney&lt;/a&gt; joined the club on a free transfer on 4 August after being released by Oldham Athletic.\nAugust.\nArgyle began the season with a 1\u20131 draw at &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Shrewsbury Town&lt;/a&gt; on 6 August. A late goal from &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Fletcher%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29\"&gt;Carl Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; cancelled out &lt;a href=\"James%20Collins%20%28footballer%20born%201990%29\"&gt;James Collins&lt;/a&gt;' opener for the home side. Three days later, the club took on &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20F.C.\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt; in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; at Home Park. &lt;a href=\"Dany%20N%27Guessan\"&gt;Dany N'Guessan&lt;/a&gt; scored the only goal of the game to eliminate Argyle from the competition. &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt; midfielder &lt;a href=\"Will%20Atkinson\"&gt;Will Atkinson&lt;/a&gt; joined the club on loan for the rest of the season. He scored the opening goal in a 4\u20131 defeat against &lt;a href=\"Rotherham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Rotherham United&lt;/a&gt; on 13 August. &lt;a href=\"Gareth%20Evans%20%28footballer%20born%201988%29\"&gt;Gareth Evans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Le%20Fondre\"&gt;Adam Le Fondre&lt;/a&gt; both scored twice for Rotherham. A third consecutive defeat followed as Argyle lost 2\u20130 at home to &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Wimbledon\"&gt;AFC Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt;. Two second half goals from &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Midson\"&gt;Jack Midson&lt;/a&gt; was the difference between the teams. &lt;a href=\"Gillingham%20F.C.\"&gt;Gillingham&lt;/a&gt; scored three late goals at &lt;a href=\"Priestfield%20Stadium\"&gt;Priestfield Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on 20 August after Gibson was sent off for two bookable offences. &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Kedwell\"&gt;Danny Kedwell&lt;/a&gt; converted two penalties and &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Rooney%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Luke Rooney&lt;/a&gt; added the other.\nZubar's contract was cancelled on 25 August after he asked to leave the club for personal reasons. Two days later, Argyle replaced &lt;a href=\"Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.\"&gt;Crewe Alexandra&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the league table after a 1\u20130 home defeat. &lt;a href=\"Shaun%20Miller\"&gt;Shaun Miller&lt;/a&gt; scored the winning goal for Crewe just before half time. Argyle were eliminated from the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Football%20League%20Trophy\"&gt;Football League Trophy&lt;/a&gt; in the first round by &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Exeter City&lt;/a&gt; after losing a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty shoot-out&lt;/a&gt;. The match ended in a 1\u20131 draw, with a goal from Daley cancelling out &lt;a href=\"James%20Dunne\"&gt;James Dunne&lt;/a&gt;'s effort for Exeter, before the home side won 3\u20130 in the shoot-out. Defender &lt;a href=\"Simon%20King%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Simon King&lt;/a&gt; and midfielder &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Griffiths\"&gt;Jamie Griffiths&lt;/a&gt; joined the club on loan for one month from Gillingham and &lt;a href=\"Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Ipswich Town&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Richards was loaned out to Barnstaple Town for a month.\nSeptember.\nHaving threatened to strike in protest about money owed to staff days beforehand, Argyle lost 2\u20131 at &lt;a href=\"Burton%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Burton Albion&lt;/a&gt; on 3 September. &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Richards%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Justin Richards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calvin%20Zola\"&gt;Calvin Zola&lt;/a&gt; gave Burton a two-goal lead before Atkinson's injury-time consolation. A brace from &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Roberts%20%28footballer%20born%201987%29\"&gt;Gary Roberts&lt;/a&gt; consigned Argyle to a sixth consecutive defeat as &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt; won 2\u20130 at Home Park. Both sides finished the match with ten men after &lt;a href=\"Marc%20Richards\"&gt;Marc Richards&lt;/a&gt; and Soukouna were sent off. The club's losing streak was extended at &lt;a href=\"Barnet%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnet&lt;/a&gt; after a 2\u20130 defeat at &lt;a href=\"Underhill%20Stadium\"&gt;Underhill Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on 13 September. &lt;a href=\"Izale%20McLeod\"&gt;Izale McLeod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Leach\"&gt;Daniel Leach&lt;/a&gt; scored either side of half time for Barnet. The club lost again four days later at &lt;a href=\"Southend%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Southend United&lt;/a&gt;. Fletcher was sent off in the 2\u20130 defeat and two former players scored Southend's goals \u2013 Liam Dickinson and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Gilbert\"&gt;Peter Gilbert&lt;/a&gt;. The next day, manager Peter Reid was relieved of his duties after 15 months in charge. The next day, Carl Fletcher was appointed as caretaker manager with Romain Larrieu as his assistant.\nThe loan deals of Simon King and Jamie Richards were extended until 7 November and 1 December respectively. A first victory of the campaign was secured on 24 September against &lt;a href=\"Macclesfield%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Macclesfield Town&lt;/a&gt;. Warren Feeney and Robbie Williams scored either side of half time to give Argyle a 2\u20130 win at Home Park.\nOctober.\nOctober began with a 2\u20130 defeat at &lt;a href=\"Crawley%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Crawley Town&lt;/a&gt;. Striker &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Tubbs\"&gt;Matt Tubbs&lt;/a&gt; scored both goals for the home side. Jamie Griffiths' loan from Ipswich Town was extended for a further month. The team threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2\u20132 with ten-man &lt;a href=\"Accrington%20Stanley%20F.C.\"&gt;Accrington Stanley&lt;/a&gt; on 8 October. Simon Walton and Ladjie Soukouna scored before half-time after &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Hessey\"&gt;Sean Hessey&lt;/a&gt; was sent-off. Despite that, Accrington came back to earn a point thanks to goals from &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Long%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Kevin Long&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A1draig%20Amond\"&gt;P\u00e1draig Amond&lt;/a&gt;. Argyle claimed their first away win of the season a week later at &lt;a href=\"Dagenham%20%26amp%3B%20Redbridge%20F.C.\"&gt;Dagenham &amp; Redbridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Lecointe\"&gt;Matt Lecointe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conor%20Hourihane\"&gt;Conor Hourihane&lt;/a&gt; gave the club a two-goal lead before &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Doe\"&gt;Scott Doe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Nurse\"&gt;Jon Nurse&lt;/a&gt; scored for Dagenham. Simon Walton converted a stoppage time penalty to give Argyle a 3\u20132 victory. A late goal from &lt;a href=\"Raffaele%20De%20Vita\"&gt;Raffaele De Vita&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt; a 1\u20130 win at Home Park on 22 October. A 5\u20131 defeat at &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Oxford United&lt;/a&gt; three days later was their eleventh of the season. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Hall%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Robert Hall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Constable\"&gt;James Constable&lt;/a&gt; both scored twice, with &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Leven\"&gt;Peter Leven&lt;/a&gt; scoring Oxford's third. Argyle were briefly level in the second half after Simon Walton converted a penalty. Jamie Griffiths was sent off as Argyle lost 2\u20131 at &lt;a href=\"Cheltenham%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Cheltenham Town&lt;/a&gt; on 29 October. An effort on goal by &lt;a href=\"Jared%20Sims\"&gt;Jared Sims&lt;/a&gt; was turned in by Cheltenham defender &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Elliott%20%28footballer%20born%201978%29\"&gt;Steve Elliott&lt;/a&gt; and Argyle retained the lead for an hour before &lt;a href=\"Darryl%20Duffy\"&gt;Darryl Duffy&lt;/a&gt; scored from the penalty spot. Griffiths was sent off two minutes later and then Duffy scored the winner in stoppage time.\nNovember.\nHaving guided Argyle to two wins and a draw since the departure of Peter Reid, new owner James Brent appointed Carl Fletcher as the club's &lt;a href=\"player-manager\"&gt;player-manager&lt;/a&gt; on a full-time basis. Defender Ben Gibson's loan from Middlesbrough was extended until 29 January. &lt;a href=\"Blackpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt; defender &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Bignot\"&gt;Paul Bignot&lt;/a&gt; joined the club on loan for three months on 4 November. An injury-time equaliser from &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Fenton\"&gt;Nick Fenton&lt;/a&gt; denied Argyle their third league win of the season as they drew 1\u20131 with &lt;a href=\"Morecambe%20F.C.\"&gt;Morecambe&lt;/a&gt;. Simon Walton gave the home side the lead in the first half and looked like picking up three much-needed points before Fenton's equaliser in the 94th minute. The club were held to a 3\u20133 draw by &lt;a href=\"Stourbridge%20F.C.\"&gt;Stourbridge&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20League%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;Southern League Premier Division&lt;/a&gt; in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Warren Feeney gave Argyle an early lead before Aaron Drake and Ryan Rowe scored either side of half-time for the visitors. Carl Fletcher equalised for Argyle, who then conceded a penalty and had Robbie Williams sent-off. Sean Geddes converted the penalty before a goal from Onismor Bhasera meant a replay was required. Argyle were reduced to nine-men in stoppage time when Connor Hourihane was sent-off for two bookable offences. Striker &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Sutherland\"&gt;Craig Sutherland&lt;/a&gt; became the second Blackpool player to join the club in November when he signed a two-month loan deal.\nFrench player &lt;a href=\"Maxime%20Blanchard\"&gt;Maxime Blanchard&lt;/a&gt; joined the club on a short-term contract having impressed manager Carl Fletcher while on trial. A brace from &lt;a href=\"Eunan%20O%27Kane\"&gt;Eunan O'Kane&lt;/a&gt; helped &lt;a href=\"Torquay%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Torquay United&lt;/a&gt; defeat Argyle 3\u20131 and claim their first league win against them since 1972. After a goalless first half, O'Kane scored twice in quick succession and &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Stevens%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201986%29\"&gt;Danny Stevens&lt;/a&gt; gave them a three-goal lead. Will Atkinson's third of the season for Argyle was merely a consolation. Three days later, Argyle lost their FA Cup first round play at Stourbridge. Paul Bignot was sent off in the first half while the game was goalless for kicking Sean Evans. The home side made their numerical advantage count after the break, with Paul McCone and Evans making it 2\u20130 to the Southern League side. Millwall defender &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Purse\"&gt;Darren Purse&lt;/a&gt; was the first of three players to join the club on loan on 24 November. Former Argyle forward &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Chadwick\"&gt;Nick Chadwick&lt;/a&gt; arrived from &lt;a href=\"Stockport%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Stockport County&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Hemmings\"&gt;Ashley Hemmings&lt;/a&gt;. Argyle moved within three points of safety after defeating &lt;a href=\"Northampton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Northampton Town&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20131 at Home Park. A Simon Walton gave them the lead and a minute later Nick Chadwick scored his 11th goal for the club. Will Atkinson made it 3\u20130 and fellow debutant Ashley Hemmings scored a fourth before half-time. Northampton scored a late consolation through &lt;a href=\"Adebayo%20Akinfenwa\"&gt;Adebayo Akinfenwa&lt;/a&gt;.\nDecember.\nArgyle resumed their league campaign on 10 December after a two-week break, having failed to reach the second round of the FA Cup. The team gained a point at &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt; after a 1\u20131 draw to move above Dagenham &amp; Redbridge at the bottom of the table. Simon Walton scored his sixth goal of the season after 59 minutes before Bradford equalised thanks to &lt;a href=\"James%20Hanson%20%28footballer%20born%201987%29\"&gt;James Hanson&lt;/a&gt; late in the game. Onismor Bhasera was sent off in stoppage time for a second bookable offence. Argyle were held to a 1\u20131 draw by &lt;a href=\"Hereford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Hereford United&lt;/a&gt; on 17 December. &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Barkhuizen\"&gt;Thomas Barkhuizen&lt;/a&gt; gave the visitors the lead midway through the second-half before Nick Chadwick equalised from the penalty spot after 81 minutes. Both sides finished the game with ten-men after Hereford's &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Townsend\"&gt;Michael Townsend&lt;/a&gt; received a second yellow card and Argyle's Darren Purse was given a straight red card. The team came from two goals behind to win 3\u20132 at &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol Rovers&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Boxing%20Day\"&gt;Boxing Day&lt;/a&gt;. The home side went ahead when &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Harrold\"&gt;Matt Harrold&lt;/a&gt; converted a penalty, and he added a second two minutes later before Warren Feeney scored for Argyle. Nick Chadwick's third goal in four games brought the scores level and Ashley Hemmings scored the decisive goal in the 93rd minute. A penalty save from &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Cole\"&gt;Jake Cole&lt;/a&gt; earned Argyle a point in a 0\u20130 draw at &lt;a href=\"Aldershot%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Aldershot Town&lt;/a&gt; which lifted the club off the foot of the table as the year came to a close.\nJanuary.\nOn the 2nd, Argyle hosted local Devon rivals &lt;a href=\"Torquay%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Torquay United&lt;/a&gt; in front of 12,836 at Home Park, which at the time was the highest League Two attendance of the season. The Gulls scored two second half goals through &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Bodin\"&gt;Billy Bodin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Mansell\"&gt;Lee Mansell&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Young%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201993%29\"&gt;Luke Young&lt;/a&gt;'s first Argyle goal was nothing but a consolation in a 2\u20131 defeat. With the &lt;a href=\"Transfer%20window\"&gt;January transfer window&lt;/a&gt; now open, Argyle confirmed the permanent signings of &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Chadwick\"&gt;Nick Chadwick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Purse\"&gt;Darren Purse&lt;/a&gt;, who had previously only been on loan from &lt;a href=\"Stockport%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Stockport County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20F.C.\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt; respectively, as well as signing former youth goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Ollie%20Chenoweth\"&gt;Ollie Chenoweth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Bideford%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bideford&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.\"&gt;Crewe Alexandra&lt;/a&gt; won all three points when Argyle travelled to &lt;a href=\"Gresty%20Road\"&gt;Gresty Road&lt;/a&gt;, a brace from &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Murphy\"&gt;Luke Murphy&lt;/a&gt; and a penalty scored by &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Westwood%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201990%29\"&gt;Ashley Westwood&lt;/a&gt; meant that &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Walton\"&gt;Simon Walton&lt;/a&gt;'s penalty and &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Lecointe\"&gt;Matt Lecointe&lt;/a&gt;'s second goal of the season were once again, nothing but consolations. &lt;a href=\"Conor%20Hourihane\"&gt;Conor Hourihane&lt;/a&gt; was sent off late on in the game for two bookable offences, which was Argyle's tenth and final red card of the season, whilst first team coach &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Nancekivell\"&gt;Kevin Nancekivell&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the stands.\n&lt;a href=\"Will%20Atkinson\"&gt;Will Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;'s loan from &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt; expired, so Argyle extended &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Hemmings\"&gt;Ashley Hemmings&lt;/a&gt;' loan deal from &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; and the contract of &lt;a href=\"Maxime%20Blanchard\"&gt;Maxime Blanchard&lt;/a&gt; until the end of the season, along with signing former Argyle captain &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Wotton\"&gt;Paul Wotton&lt;/a&gt; on a free transfer from &lt;a href=\"Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Yeovil Town&lt;/a&gt;, and young winger &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Lennox\"&gt;Joe Lennox&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol City&lt;/a&gt;. Argyle played two home games in a row, the first seeing the team's first win of 2012, with a 2\u20131 win over &lt;a href=\"Burton%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Burton Albion&lt;/a&gt;, where two goals from Simon Walton either side of a goal from &lt;a href=\"Calvin%20Zola\"&gt;Calvin Zola&lt;/a&gt; sealed the points. The second game saw Argyle rescue a late point thanks to Maxime Blanchard's first goal in English football, the goal lifted Argyle out of the bottom two with the French defender scoring an overhead kick to cancel out &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Mills\"&gt;Pablo Mills&lt;/a&gt;' first half stoppage time goal for high flying &lt;a href=\"Crawley%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Crawley Town&lt;/a&gt;. The last game of the month saw the Greens travel to &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Vale%20Park\"&gt;Vale Park&lt;/a&gt;, where an 86th minute &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Pope\"&gt;Tom Pope&lt;/a&gt; goal saw the hosts win 1\u20130. Youth goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Ollie%20Chenoweth\"&gt;Ollie Chenoweth&lt;/a&gt; left to join &lt;a href=\"Truro%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Truro City&lt;/a&gt; on loan, whilst striker &lt;a href=\"Rory%20Patterson\"&gt;Rory Patterson&lt;/a&gt; returned from his loan at &lt;a href=\"Linfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Linfield&lt;/a&gt; and was immediately released. On the transfer deadline day, strikers &lt;a href=\"Juvhel%20Tsoumou\"&gt;Juvhel Tsoumou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alex%20MacDonald%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201990%29\"&gt;Alex MacDonald&lt;/a&gt; joined on loan deals from &lt;a href=\"Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.\"&gt;Preston North End&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burnley%20F.C.\"&gt;Burnley&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nFebruary.\nThe first game of February was the only League Two game to go ahead that weekend, with adverse weather affecting the majority of the country. Former Argyle manager &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Sturrock\"&gt;Paul Sturrock&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Southend%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Southend United&lt;/a&gt; were visitors to &lt;a href=\"Home%20Park\"&gt;Home Park&lt;/a&gt;, and went 2\u20130 up in the first half through &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Timlin\"&gt;Michael Timlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Martin%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201985%29\"&gt;Dave Martin&lt;/a&gt;. Argyle's resurgent attitude however saw them pull level late on, with goals from &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Chadwick\"&gt;Nick Chadwick&lt;/a&gt; and debutant &lt;a href=\"Alex%20MacDonald%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201990%29\"&gt;Alex MacDonald&lt;/a&gt; denying Southend from going top of the table. A series of 0\u20130 draws at home to &lt;a href=\"Barnet%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagenham%20%26amp%3B%20Redbridge%20F.C.\"&gt;Dag &amp; Red&lt;/a&gt; surrounded Argyle's biggest win of the season, a 4\u20130 triumph away to &lt;a href=\"Accrington%20Stanley%20F.C.\"&gt;Accrington Stanley&lt;/a&gt; in which Alex MacDonald's first half brace was added to by &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Purse\"&gt;Darren Purse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Bignot\"&gt;Paul Bignot&lt;/a&gt;. Argyle travelled to &lt;a href=\"Macclesfield%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Macclesfield Town&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Moss%20Rose\"&gt;Moss Rose&lt;/a&gt; looking to go the whole of February unbeaten, but were disappointed when &lt;a href=\"Conor%20Hourihane\"&gt;Conor Hourihane&lt;/a&gt;'s 71st-minute goal was cancelled out by former Pilgrim &lt;a href=\"George%20Donnelly%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Georgie Donnelly&lt;/a&gt; in the 95th minute.\nMarch.\nPostponements through the winter saw a fixture packed March in which Argyle played seven games. &lt;a href=\"Gillingham%20F.C.\"&gt;Gillingham&lt;/a&gt; came to Home Park for the first of the seven games, with &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Martin%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Joe Martin&lt;/a&gt; giving them a 23rd-minute lead, before being sent off for a second bookable offence just eight minutes later. Argyle pushed the 10 men of Gillingham for the next hour but failed to score, losing 1\u20130. Three days later, Argyle had better fortunes on the road, beating &lt;a href=\"A.F.C.%20Wimbledon\"&gt;AFC Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 with goals from &lt;a href=\"Onismor%20Bhasera\"&gt;Onismor Bhasera&lt;/a&gt;, just 12 seconds into the game, and &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Chadwick\"&gt;Nick Chadwick&lt;/a&gt; either side of a &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Midson\"&gt;Jack Midson&lt;/a&gt; goal for the Dons. A visit to the &lt;a href=\"Don%20Valley%20Stadium\"&gt;Don Valley Stadium&lt;/a&gt; was next, where a penalty given away by &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Purse\"&gt;Darren Purse&lt;/a&gt; saw &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20Grabban\"&gt;Lewis Grabban&lt;/a&gt; score to earn &lt;a href=\"Rotherham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Rotherham United&lt;/a&gt; all three points. The next week, the pendulum swung once again, with &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Wotton\"&gt;Paul Wotton&lt;/a&gt; scoring his first goal since returning to Argyle in a 1\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Shrewsbury Town&lt;/a&gt;, lifting the Greens out of the bottom two once again. Next up was the visit of &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bristol Rovers&lt;/a&gt;, who took a first half lead through &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Harrold\"&gt;Matt Harrold&lt;/a&gt;, only for &lt;a href=\"Maxime%20Blanchard\"&gt;Maxime Blanchard&lt;/a&gt; to equalise late on for the hosts, which saw Argyle rise to 21st position in the table. Argyle completed the loan signing of &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Fletcher\"&gt;Steve Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"A.F.C.%20Bournemouth\"&gt;AFC Bournemouth&lt;/a&gt;, who sat out Argyle's 0\u20130 draw away to &lt;a href=\"Northampton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Northampton Town&lt;/a&gt;, before making his debut as a substitute in a 1\u20130 win at home to &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Juvhel%20Tsoumou\"&gt;Juvhel Tsoumou&lt;/a&gt;'s goal saw Argyle claim the three points, to sit on forty points for the season.\nApril.\nArgyle's form had significantly improved compared to fellow relegation battlers &lt;a href=\"Hereford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Hereford United&lt;/a&gt;, who Argyle travelled to on the 6th of April. An own goal from Dutch defender &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Stam\"&gt;Stefan Stam&lt;/a&gt; gave Argyle the lead, but the Greens failed to extend their lead after a missed penalty from &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Walton\"&gt;Simon Walton&lt;/a&gt; and the inevitable happened when Hereford's &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Barkhuizen\"&gt;Tom Barkhuizen&lt;/a&gt; equalised in the second half. An injury to goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Cole\"&gt;Jake Cole&lt;/a&gt; saw &lt;a href=\"Romain%20Larrieu\"&gt;Romain Larrieu&lt;/a&gt; start and saw &lt;a href=\"Ollie%20Chenoweth\"&gt;Ollie Chenoweth&lt;/a&gt; recalled from his loan at &lt;a href=\"Truro%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Truro City&lt;/a&gt; to sit on the bench in a 1\u20130 win at home to &lt;a href=\"Aldershot%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Aldershot Town&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Alex%20MacDonald%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201990%29\"&gt;Alex MacDonald&lt;/a&gt; the goalscorer. A visit to historical rivals &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt; was next, and despite losing 1\u20130 through an 84th minute &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Connell\"&gt;Alan Connell&lt;/a&gt; goal, results elsewhere meant that Argyle were nearly safe from relegation, with seven points separating them from the bottom two and with three games left to play.\nIt was in Argyle's very next game in which they secured their Football League survival, a 1\u20131 draw with &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Oxford United&lt;/a&gt; at Home Park. &lt;a href=\"Robbie%20Williams%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201984%29\"&gt;Robbie Williams&lt;/a&gt;' free kick had given Argyle the lead, before &lt;a href=\"Asa%20Hall\"&gt;Asa Hall&lt;/a&gt; equalised for the visitors. &lt;a href=\"Macclesfield%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Macclesfield&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Hereford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Hereford&lt;/a&gt;'s results elsewhere meant that Argyle were safe. With league survival now secured, Argyle travelled to &lt;a href=\"Morecambe%20F.C.\"&gt;Morecambe&lt;/a&gt; and gave a debut to goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Ollie%20Chenoweth\"&gt;Ollie Chenoweth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Young%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201993%29\"&gt;Luke Young&lt;/a&gt;'s fourth-minute goal was cancelled out by &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Burrow\"&gt;Jordan Burrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20Alessandra\"&gt;Lewis Alessandra&lt;/a&gt;, before captain-for-the-day &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Purse\"&gt;Darren Purse&lt;/a&gt; headed home a late equaliser for Argyle.\nMay.\nArgyle played their final game of the season at home to &lt;a href=\"Cheltenham%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Cheltenham Town&lt;/a&gt;, who had already secured a play-off spot. Former Argyle striker &lt;a href=\"Steven%20MacLean%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Steven MacLean&lt;/a&gt; gave the visitors the lead with a deflected free kick, before &lt;a href=\"Juvhel%20Tsoumou\"&gt;Juvhel Tsoumou&lt;/a&gt; equalised in the second half and the Robins then instantly took the lead again through &lt;a href=\"Marlon%20Pack\"&gt;Marlon Pack&lt;/a&gt;. With the score at 2\u20131 and neither side having anything to play for, manager &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Fletcher%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29\"&gt;Carl Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; substituted soon-to-retire goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Romain%20Larrieu\"&gt;Romain Larrieu&lt;/a&gt; on for &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Cole\"&gt;Jake Cole&lt;/a&gt; in the 85th minute. Argyle finished the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Football%20League%20Two\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt; with 46 points and in 21st place, ahead of &lt;a href=\"Barnet%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnet&lt;/a&gt; on goal difference."
