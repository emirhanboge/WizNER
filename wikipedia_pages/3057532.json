    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, specifically &lt;a href=\"measure%20theory\"&gt;measure theory&lt;/a&gt;, a complex measure generalizes the concept of &lt;a href=\"measure%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;measure&lt;/a&gt; by letting it have &lt;a href=\"complex%20number\"&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; values. In other words, one allows for &lt;a href=\"Set%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;sets&lt;/a&gt; whose size (length, area, volume) is a complex number.\nDefinition.\nFormally, a \"complex measure\" formula_1 on a &lt;a href=\"sigma-algebra\"&gt;measurable space&lt;/a&gt; formula_2 is a complex-valued &lt;a href=\"function%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;\nthat is &lt;a href=\"sigma%20additivity\"&gt;sigma-additive&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, for any &lt;a href=\"sequence\"&gt;sequence&lt;/a&gt; formula_4 of &lt;a href=\"disjoint%20sets\"&gt;disjoint sets&lt;/a&gt; belonging to formula_5, one has\nAs formula_7 for any permutation (&lt;a href=\"bijection\"&gt;bijection&lt;/a&gt;) formula_8, it follows that formula_9 &lt;a href=\"Unconditional%20convergence\"&gt;converges unconditionally&lt;/a&gt; (hence &lt;a href=\"Absolute%20convergence\"&gt;absolutely&lt;/a&gt;).\nIntegration with respect to a complex measure.\nOne can define the \"integral\" of a complex-valued &lt;a href=\"measurable%20function\"&gt;measurable function&lt;/a&gt; with respect to a complex measure in the same way as the &lt;a href=\"Lebesgue%20integral\"&gt;Lebesgue integral&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt;-valued measurable function with respect to a &lt;a href=\"Measure%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;non-negative measure&lt;/a&gt;, by approximating a measurable function with &lt;a href=\"simple%20function\"&gt;simple function&lt;/a&gt;s. Just as in the case of ordinary integration, this more general integral might fail to exist, or its value might be infinite (the &lt;a href=\"Riemann%20sphere\"&gt;complex infinity&lt;/a&gt;).\nAnother approach is to not develop a theory of integration from scratch, but rather use the already available concept of integral of a real-valued function with respect to a non-negative measure. To that end, it is a quick check that the real and imaginary parts \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 of a complex measure \u03bc are finite-valued &lt;a href=\"signed%20measure\"&gt;signed measure&lt;/a&gt;s. One can apply the &lt;a href=\"Hahn%20decomposition%20theorem\"&gt;Hahn-Jordan decomposition&lt;/a&gt; to these measures to split them as\nand\nwhere \u03bc1+, \u03bc1\u2212, \u03bc2+, \u03bc2\u2212 are finite-valued non-negative measures (which are unique in some sense). Then, for a measurable function \"f\" which is \"real-valued\" for the moment, one can define\nas long as the expression on the right-hand side is defined, that is, all four integrals exist and when adding them up one does not encounter the &lt;a href=\"indeterminate%20form\"&gt;indeterminate&lt;/a&gt; \u221e\u2212\u221e.\nGiven now a \"complex-valued\" measurable function, one can integrate its real and imaginary components separately as illustrated above and define, as expected,\nVariation of a complex measure and polar decomposition.\nFor a complex measure \u03bc, one defines its \"variation\", or \"absolute value\", |\u03bc| by the formula\nwhere \"A\" is in \u03a3 and the &lt;a href=\"supremum\"&gt;supremum&lt;/a&gt; runs over all sequences of disjoint sets (\"A\"\"n\")\"n\" whose &lt;a href=\"Union%20%28set%20theory%29\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt; is \"A\". Taking only finite partitions of the set \"A\" into &lt;a href=\"Measurable%20set\"&gt;measurable subsets&lt;/a&gt;, one obtains an equivalent definition.\nIt turns out that |\u03bc| is a non-negative finite measure. In the same way as a complex number can be represented in a &lt;a href=\"complex%20number\"&gt;polar form&lt;/a&gt;, one has a \"polar decomposition\" for a complex measure: There exists a measurable function \u03b8 with real values such that\nmeaning\nfor any &lt;a href=\"absolutely%20integrable\"&gt;absolutely integrable&lt;/a&gt; measurable function \"f\", i.e., \"f\" satisfying\nOne can use the &lt;a href=\"Radon%E2%80%93Nikodym%20theorem\"&gt;Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem&lt;/a&gt; to prove that the variation is a measure and the existence of the &lt;a href=\"polar%20decomposition\"&gt;polar decomposition&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe space of complex measures.\nThe sum of two complex measures is a complex measure, as is the product of a complex measure by a complex number. That is to say, the set of all complex measures on a measure space (\"X\", \u03a3) forms a &lt;a href=\"vector%20space\"&gt;vector space&lt;/a&gt; over the complex numbers. Moreover, the \"&lt;a href=\"total%20variation\"&gt;total variation&lt;/a&gt;\" formula_18 defined as\nis a &lt;a href=\"Norm%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;norm&lt;/a&gt;, with respect to which the space of complex measures is a &lt;a href=\"Banach%20space\"&gt;Banach space&lt;/a&gt;."
