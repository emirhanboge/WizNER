    "text": "Senegalia montis-salinarum, is a species of thorn tree that is native to two separate localities in the &lt;a href=\"Soutpansberg\"&gt;Soutpansberg&lt;/a&gt; range in &lt;a href=\"Limpopo\"&gt;Limpopo&lt;/a&gt;, South Africa. The total population is estimated at no more than 250 adult trees. Based on its morphology, it is assigned to the \"&lt;a href=\"Senegalia%20burkei\"&gt;S. burkei&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"species%20complex\"&gt;species complex&lt;/a&gt;.\nHabitat.\nIt grows on rocky scree slopes in the hot &lt;a href=\"rain%20shadow\"&gt;rain shadow&lt;/a&gt; of the Soutpansberg range.\nDescription.\nIt is a multi-stemmed tree. It has smaller flowers than \"A. burkei\" and produces more seeds. The wood is soft and semi-succulent, and dead wood decays quickly.\nStatus.\nIt may qualify as &lt;a href=\"Endangered%20species\"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt; due to the small population size and the proximity of the type locality to Coal of Africa's Makhado Colliery project."
