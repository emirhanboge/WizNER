It is an important residential area of and is famous for its schools, market, residential colonies and residences of film artists. Virugambakkam had some of Chennai's oldest film studios.\nVirugambakkam is one of the important localities of Chennai and owes its growth to the expansion of the city in the post-independence period. Prior to the establishment of residential colonies, Virugambakkam was a village covered by paddy fields, mango orchards and casurina trees. Virugambakkam was first included within the Chennai city limits in 1977 along with other villages like &lt;a href=\"Saligramam\"&gt;Saligramam&lt;/a&gt;.\nVirugambakkam is well-connected with the heart of Chennai city through roads. Buses running through &lt;a href=\"Arcot%20Road\"&gt;Arcot Road&lt;/a&gt; link Virugambakkam with the more inner suburbs of Chennai city.\nLocation.\nVirugambakkam is situated at a distance of 14.6 kilometres from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20St%20George\"&gt;Fort St George&lt;/a&gt; and 12.5 kilometres from &lt;a href=\"Poonamallee\"&gt;Poonamallee&lt;/a&gt;. It is bound by Saligramam in the east, &lt;a href=\"Koyambedu\"&gt;Koyambedu&lt;/a&gt; to the north and &lt;a href=\"Alwarthirunagar\"&gt;Alwarthirunagar&lt;/a&gt; to the west and south-west and &lt;a href=\"K.K.%20Nagar\"&gt;K.K.

Its frontier with Alwarthirunagar forms the western limits of the Corporation of Chennai.\nHistory.\nThe growth of Virugambakkam accompanied the expansion of Madras city during the years preceding independence. Virugambakkam was one of the many localities which cropped up during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, it was a part of the Kodambakkam-Saligramam-Puliyur residential district of Greater Madras. During the 1940s, Arcot Road was constructed connecting Nungambakkam with the Mount-Poonamallee Road. In 1948, the first movie studios made their appearance when &lt;a href=\"Avichi%20Meiyappa%20Chettiar\"&gt;Avichi Meiyappa Chettiar&lt;/a&gt; shifted his base from &lt;a href=\"Karaikudi\"&gt;Karaikudi&lt;/a&gt;. The locality has since become a haven for movie producers and cine artists.\nVirugambakkam was one of the important places connected with the Anti-Hindi agitations of 1965. Aranganathan, a 32-year-old employee with the Indian Postal Service immolated himself in protest against the imposition of Hindi. The &lt;a href=\"Dravida%20Munnetra%20Kazhagam\"&gt;Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam&lt;/a&gt; vigorously campaigned in the Virugambakkam region during the 1967 elections. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has done a first state level meeting it has been organised by V.P Akilan. the meeting has been held in front of Arignar Anna, Karunanithi, M.G Ramachandran and some leaders in Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.\nUntil the 1970s, Virugambakkam was little more than an insignificant village. It formed a part of Saidapet taluk of Chengleput district. Apart from a few movie studios, there were only a few sparsely populated settlements. The interior area which makes up the middle-class residential colonies were covered by paddy fields. The town had a population of 8,013 in 1971. During those times, the outlying suburbs of the city alongside Arcot Road had a reputation for insecurity and as the haunt of sex. Until the early 1970s, the suburb of Kodambakkam formed the western frontier of Madras city. Virugambakkam was included in Madras city in 1973 along with &lt;a href=\"Saligrammam\"&gt;Saligrammam&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, growth has accelerated, peaking in the 1980s and 1990s. The good quality of ground water available in the Arcot Road suburbs was an important reason for the region's growth.\nGeography.\nThe soil is fertile and productive as is evident from the fact that paddy fields once covered the area. However, paddy fields have completely disappeared. Natural gas was discovered near Virugambakkam in 1966. To date, Virugambakkam is the only known source of natural gas in Chennai city apart from &lt;a href=\"Avadi\"&gt;Avadi&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce Virugambakkam had a big lake which was maintained by Madras Water Supplies and Sewage Board (now called CMWSSB) and drew water for drinking with several pump houses around the lake until 1976, and several small ponds. After that the lake was encroached by antisocial elements with help of all party politicians and converted it into a habitat. The road around that lake turned habitat is called as Erikarai Street. The ponds have also been encroached and turned into habitat.\nThe Virugambakkam Canal separates Virugambakkam from suburbs such as &lt;a href=\"Koyambedu\"&gt;Koyambedu&lt;/a&gt;, which lie towards the interior. The canal runs for about 6 kilometres through the suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Choolaimedu\"&gt;Choolaimedu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arumbakkam\"&gt;Arumbakkam&lt;/a&gt; and Vadapalani before entering Virugambakkam. This canal originally served the purpose of irrigating farm lands. However, with the transformation of farmlands into residential localities, the canal has been converted into a drain. During the &lt;a href=\"monsoon\"&gt;monsoon&lt;/a&gt;s, the canal frequently overflows creating havoc for the residents of the nearby areas. In 2003, desilting work was carried out to deal with the situation.\nLocalities.\nVirugambakkam extends for about 2 kilometres from Avichi Higher Sec. School in Arcot Road to Valasarawakkam.
