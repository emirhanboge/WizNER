    "text": "V\u00edctor Neumann-Lara (1933\u20132004) was a Mexican &lt;a href=\"mathematician\"&gt;mathematician&lt;/a&gt;, pioneer in the field of &lt;a href=\"graph%20theory\"&gt;graph theory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. His work also covers &lt;a href=\"general%20topology\"&gt;general topology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"game%20theory\"&gt;game theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"combinatorics\"&gt;combinatorics&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBorn in the city of &lt;a href=\"Huejutla%20de%20Reyes\"&gt;Huejutla de Reyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hidalgo%20%28Mexico%29\"&gt;Hidalgo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, he soon moved to &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;, where he received his bachelor's degree in &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt; from the School of Sciences, &lt;a href=\"National%20Autonomous%20University%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;UNAM&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis life was greatly devoted to teaching, giving over 100 courses in Mexico and around the world, and introducing new &lt;a href=\"teaching%20method\"&gt;teaching method&lt;/a&gt;s. He carried color chalks with him all the time, and was prompt to give graphic explanations.\nWork.\nFull Professor at Institute of Mathematics, &lt;a href=\"UNAM\"&gt;UNAM&lt;/a&gt;, he directed over 15 theses and taught both in the Institute and in the Faculty of Sciences. Below is a selection of his multiple publications, which earned him over 120 citations from renowned mathematicians in the area of graph theory.\nIn 1982 he introduced the notion of dichromatic number of a &lt;a href=\"directed%20graph\"&gt;digraph&lt;/a&gt;, which will eventually be used in kernel theory and &lt;a href=\"tournament%20theory\"&gt;tournament theory&lt;/a&gt;."
