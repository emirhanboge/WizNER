    "text": "Milton-Montford is a &lt;a href=\"neighborhood\"&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of East &lt;a href=\"Baltimore\"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. Milton-Montford lies north of &lt;a href=\"Patterson%20Park\"&gt;Patterson Park&lt;/a&gt; and south of &lt;a href=\"Amtrak\"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Corridor\"&gt;Northeast Corridor&lt;/a&gt;. The neighborhood is bounded by the neighborhoods of &lt;a href=\"McElderry%20Park%2C%20Baltimore\"&gt;McElderry Park&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"Madison-Eastend%2C%20Baltimore\"&gt;Madison-Eastend&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Biddle%20Street%2C%20Baltimore\"&gt;Biddle Street&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East%2C%20Baltimore\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; to the west. The swath of land between &lt;a href=\"Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital\"&gt;Johns Hopkins Hospital&lt;/a&gt; and Frank C Bocek Park, which includes Milton-Montford, is often referred to as the \"Down the Hill\" neighborhood by local residents.\nHistory.\nThe neighborhood lies within the &lt;a href=\"East%20Monument%20Historic%20District\"&gt;East Monument Historic District&lt;/a&gt;. The district is historically significant due to the large &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Czechs%20in%20Baltimore\"&gt;Czech-American&lt;/a&gt; immigrant community that once lived in the area. Milton-Montford has since transitioned to a majority &lt;a href=\"African-American%20neighborhood\"&gt;African-American neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilton-Montford is a neighborhood in transition due to &lt;a href=\"gentrification\"&gt;gentrification&lt;/a&gt; driven by &lt;a href=\"Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital\"&gt;Johns Hopkins Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. Sales of houses have increased since 2016 and prices have soared. Cost of real estate in Milton-Montford neighborhood has increased partly because of the nearby Station East redevelopment."
