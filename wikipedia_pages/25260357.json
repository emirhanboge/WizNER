She later joined \"Montpellier Le Cr\u00e8s\". In 2001, \"Le Cr\u00e8s\" joined professional football club &lt;a href=\"Montpellier%20HSC\"&gt;Montpellier HSC&lt;/a&gt; to form the club's &lt;a href=\"Montpellier%20HSC%20%28Ladies%29\"&gt;women's section&lt;/a&gt;. Diguelman spent only a year in the youth system earning her debut during the 2001\u201302 season.

Her play, along with the team as a whole, saw Montpellier win the league title. The following season, Diguelman and Montpellier earned another title with the midfielder starting all 22 league matches. The 2005\u201306 season saw Montpellier earned no titles despite Diguelman scoring a career-high nine goals. Diguelman later helped the club win the 2006\u201307 Challenge de France and two seasons later contributed to the club's capture of another Challenge de France, as well as a 2nd-place finish in the league.
