    "text": "George Michael \"Catfish\" Metkovich (October 8, 1920 \u2014 May 17, 1995) was an American &lt;a href=\"outfielder\"&gt;outfielder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; (1943\u201346), &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; (1947), &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20White%20Sox\"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt; (1949), &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; (1951\u201353), &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; (1953) and &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Braves\"&gt;Milwaukee Braves&lt;/a&gt; (1954). Born in &lt;a href=\"Angels%20Camp%2C%20California\"&gt;Angels Camp, California&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Croats\"&gt;Croatian&lt;/a&gt; parents, Metkovich earned his nickname when he stepped on a &lt;a href=\"catfish\"&gt;catfish&lt;/a&gt; during a fishing trip and cut his foot; the injury and ensuing infection caused him to miss several games.\nMetkovich stood 6'1\" (185\u00a0cm) tall, weighed 185 pounds (84\u00a0kg), and batted and threw left-handed. He helped the Red Sox win the &lt;a href=\"1946%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1946&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; pennant as the team's semi-regular &lt;a href=\"right%20fielder\"&gt;right fielder&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared as a &lt;a href=\"pinch%20hitter\"&gt;pinch hitter&lt;/a&gt; twice in the &lt;a href=\"1946%20World%20Series\"&gt;1946 World Series&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;. After flying out against &lt;a href=\"Red%20Munger\"&gt;Red Munger&lt;/a&gt; in Game 4, Metkovich's pinch double off &lt;a href=\"Murry%20Dickson\"&gt;Murry Dickson&lt;/a&gt; in the eighth inning of Game 7 helped the Red Sox come back from a 3\u20131 deficit. He scored the tying run on a double by &lt;a href=\"Dom%20DiMaggio\"&gt;Dom DiMaggio&lt;/a&gt;. But in the bottom of the same inning, the Cardinals broke the 3\u20133 tie on &lt;a href=\"Enos%20Slaughter\"&gt;Enos Slaughter&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Slaughter%27s%20Mad%20Dash\"&gt;mad dash&lt;/a&gt;\" to win the game and the world championship.\nMetkovich's early career was spent in the &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt;, but his career peak came in the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; of the early 1950s. He finished 38th in voting for the 1952 National League &lt;a href=\"Most%20Valuable%20Player\"&gt;Most Valuable Player&lt;/a&gt;, playing in 125 games and batting .271 with 101 hits, 7 home runs, and 41 RBIs. In his 10 MLB seasons he played in 1055 games, batting .261 with 934 hits, 47 home runs, and 373 RBIs.\nMetkovich's playing career spanned 19 years (1939\u201357). He managed the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Padres%20%28PCL%29\"&gt;San Diego Padres&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League\"&gt;Pacific Coast League&lt;/a&gt; from May 16, 1957, through July 23, 1960, posting three winning records. He also briefly scouted for the &lt;a href=\"expansion%20team\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1960s.\nMetkovich appeared in several Hollywood movies between 1949 and 1952. In \"\"&lt;a href=\"Three%20Little%20Words%20%28film%29\"&gt;Three Little Words&lt;/a&gt;\" (1950)\", he performed in several slapstick comedy scenes with &lt;a href=\"Red%20Skelton\"&gt;Red Skelton&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe died in &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Mesa%2C%20California\"&gt;Costa Mesa, California&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 74. In 2013, Metkovich was inducted posthumously in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;."
