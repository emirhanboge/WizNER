    "text": "ParAccel, Inc. was a &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"software\"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; company.\nIt provided a &lt;a href=\"database%20management%20system\"&gt;database management system&lt;/a&gt; designed to provide advanced &lt;a href=\"analytics\"&gt;analytics&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"business%20intelligence\"&gt;business intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. ParAccel was acquired by &lt;a href=\"Actian\"&gt;Actian&lt;/a&gt; in April 2013.\nHistory.\nParAccel was a venture-backed company focused on developing software for data analysis.\nIt acquired some &lt;a href=\"intellectual%20property\"&gt;intellectual property&lt;/a&gt; from the company XPrime, which ended operations in 2005.\nIt was officially incorporated in February 2006, founded by Barry Zane who became chief technology officer, Tom Clancey as interim-CEO, and was first funded by &lt;a href=\"angel%20investor\"&gt;angel investor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn August 2006 the first series of &lt;a href=\"venture%20capital\"&gt;venture capital&lt;/a&gt; came from Mohr Davidow Ventures, Bay Partners and Tao Venture Partners.\nIn 2007 the company was based in &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%2C%20California\"&gt;San Diego, California&lt;/a&gt;, with an office in &lt;a href=\"Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Ann Arbor, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. David J. Ehrlich was chief executive, and Bruce Scott, vice president of engineering.\nIn November 2007, a second round of $20 million included previous investors and was led by Walden Ventures.\nIn December the company opened an office in &lt;a href=\"Cupertino%2C%20California\"&gt;Cupertino, California&lt;/a&gt; (part of &lt;a href=\"Silicon%20Valley\"&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt;).\nA third round of $22 million in June 2009 was led by &lt;a href=\"Menlo%20Ventures\"&gt;Menlo Ventures&lt;/a&gt;. In January 2010 Mark Lockareff replaced Ehrlich as interim chief executive.\nIn March 2010 the \"&lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street%20Journal\"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" listed ParAccel in a list of venture backed companies that included &lt;a href=\"Solyndra\"&gt;Solyndra&lt;/a&gt;.\nA result from the TPC-H benchmark from the &lt;a href=\"Transaction%20Processing%20Performance%20Council\"&gt;Transaction Processing Performance Council&lt;/a&gt; in April 2010 had record performance at 1\u00a0TB data size using &lt;a href=\"VMware\"&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt;. Charles W. Berger was appointed chairman and CEO in September 2010.\nBy early 2011 many of its competitors had been acquired.\nDuring its July 2011 funding round, existing investors were led by &lt;a href=\"Amazon.com\"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn December 2012, the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Redshift\"&gt;Amazon Redshift&lt;/a&gt; database service was announced (and generally available in early 2013) using ParAccel technology.\nParAccel was based in California with offices in &lt;a href=\"Campbell%2C%20California\"&gt;Campbell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego\"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompetitors included &lt;a href=\"Greenplum\"&gt;Greenplum&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=\"GoPivotal\"&gt;Pivotal&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"EXASOL\"&gt;EXASOL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vertica\"&gt;Vertica&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=\"Hewlett-Packard\"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Netezza\"&gt;Netezza&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=\"IBM\"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Corporation\"&gt;Oracle Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Teradata\"&gt;Teradata&lt;/a&gt; (including its &lt;a href=\"Aster%20Data%20Systems\"&gt;Aster Data Systems&lt;/a&gt; technology).\nParAccel was acquired by &lt;a href=\"Actian\"&gt;Actian&lt;/a&gt; in April 2013.\nBerger left at that time to become CEO of &lt;a href=\"Extreme%20Networks\"&gt;Extreme Networks&lt;/a&gt;.\nProducts.\nIn 2006 ParAccel offered two different products: Amigo and Maverick. Amigo was designed to accelerate queries directed at an existing data warehouse while leaving the data warehouse as the database of record. In contrast Maverick was designed as a stand-alone data store.\nParAccel discontinued Amigo in favor of the stand-alone offering which evolved into the ParAccel Analytic Database (PADB).\nThe ParAccel Analytic Database was a parallel relational database system using a &lt;a href=\"shared-nothing%20architecture\"&gt;shared-nothing architecture&lt;/a&gt; with a columnar orientation, &lt;a href=\"adaptive%20compression\"&gt;adaptive compression&lt;/a&gt;, memory-centric design.\nParAccel's DBMS engine is built for analytics, initially based on &lt;a href=\"PostgreSQL\"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;. ParAccel began phasing in a new optimizer (Omne) in release 2.0 and made significant changes to Omne in subsequent releases (3.1 released in June 2011).\nParAccel implements compiled queries, and a proprietary interconnect protocol for inter-node communications.\nParAccel offered on-demand integration (ODI) modules for analytics and data outside of the ParAccel Analytic Platform."
