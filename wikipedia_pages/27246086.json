    "text": "Skip Blumberg (born October 10, 1947) is one of the original camcorder-for-broadcast TV producers, and among the first wave of video artists in the 1970s. His early work reflects the era's emphasis on guerrilla tactics and medium-specific graphics, but his more recent work takes on more global issues. His work has screened widely on television and at museums. His video Pick Up Your Feet: The Double Dutch Show (1981) is considered a classic documentary video and was included in the Museum of Television and Radio's exhibition TV Critics' All-time Favorite Shows. His cultural documentaries and performance videos have been broadcast on &lt;a href=\"PBS\"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt;, National Geographic TV, Showtime, Bravo, &lt;a href=\"Nickelodeon%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;Nickelodeon&lt;/a&gt;, among others.\nHe was a part of the early video collective &lt;a href=\"Videofreex\"&gt;Videofreex&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is currently producing works for &lt;a href=\"The%20My%20Hero%20Project\"&gt;The My Hero Project&lt;/a&gt;. and &lt;a href=\"Sesame%20Street\"&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt; along with various independent productions."
