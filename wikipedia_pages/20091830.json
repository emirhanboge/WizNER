In 1964, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sporting%20News\"&gt;The Sporting News&lt;/a&gt;\" said his number one pitch was a slider. However, other sources say he threw a knuckleball. In the &lt;a href=\"minor%20league%20baseball\"&gt;minor leagues&lt;/a&gt;, he won over 100 games, leading the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20League%20%281938%E2%80%932020%29\"&gt;Eastern League&lt;/a&gt; in wins in 1958, with 17, while playing for the &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%20Red%20Roses\"&gt;Lancaster Red Roses&lt;/a&gt;.

On November 27, 1962, Seyfried was traded with fellow hurler &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Nischwitz\"&gt;Ron Nischwitz&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt; for veteran &lt;a href=\"third%20baseman\"&gt;third baseman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bubba%20Phillips\"&gt;Bubba Phillips&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter spending the 1963 minor league season at Triple-A, Seyfried made his &lt;a href=\"MLB\"&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt; debut on September 13, 1963, against the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels\"&gt;Los Angeles Angels&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dodger%20Stadium\"&gt;Dodger Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, only a few miles up the freeway from his Long Beach home town. Relieving &lt;a href=\"Early%20Wynn\"&gt;Early Wynn&lt;/a&gt;, Seyfried pitched one &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt; and allowed two &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; and no &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; before being lifted for a &lt;a href=\"pinch%20hitter\"&gt;pinch hitter&lt;/a&gt;; Cleveland prevailed in 12 innings, 7\u20136, with &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Bell\"&gt;Gary Bell&lt;/a&gt; getting the win. In the third and final game of his 1963 late-season trial, Seyfried received his only big-league &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;start&lt;/a&gt;. Facing the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Athletics\"&gt;Kansas City Athletics&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20Stadium%20%28Kansas%20City%29\"&gt;Municipal Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, Seyfried allowed only one &lt;a href=\"earned%20run\"&gt;earned run&lt;/a&gt; in 5 innings, but departed the game trailing 2\u20131; when Cleveland could not rally from behind, Seyfried was tagged with the loss in his only MLB &lt;a href=\"decision%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt;. In 1964, Seyfried worked in two scoreless April relief appearances for the Indians, before returning to Triple-A. He retired as a pitcher in mid-1967, and spent the remainder of that season as the &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coast%20Indians\"&gt;Gulf Coast Indians&lt;/a&gt;, Cleveland's &lt;a href=\"Rookie-level\"&gt;Rookie-level&lt;/a&gt; affiliate.\nAll told, in five games and 9 innings pitched in the majors, Seyfried allowed only that one earned run for a career &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; of 0.93. He allowed 13 hits and three &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;fanned&lt;/a&gt; one hitter, &lt;a href=\"Gino%20Cimoli\"&gt;Gino Cimoli&lt;/a&gt; of the Athletics, during his start on September 27, 1963."
