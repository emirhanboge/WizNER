    "text": "\"Ov Fire and the Void\" is a song by the &lt;a href=\"extreme%20metal\"&gt;extreme metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Behemoth%20%28band%29\"&gt;Behemoth&lt;/a&gt; from their 2009 album &lt;a href=\"Evangelion%20%28album%29\"&gt;Evangelion&lt;/a&gt;. The lyrics are inspired by &lt;a href=\"Philosophy%20of%20Max%20Stirner\"&gt;Max Stirner's philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. When the first demo versions were recorded, Adarm \"Nergal\" Darski shared how he perceived the aural essence:\nMusic video.\nRecording and production.\nThe video for \"Ov Fire and the Void\" was filmed by Grupa 13 in &lt;a href=\"Wroc%C5%82aw\"&gt;Wroc\u0142aw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and was directed by \"Dariusz Szermanowicz\". Both parties had previously worked on the video for \"At The Left Hand Ov God\". Behemoth began working on the project in early July 2009 and they aimed to have its premiere in late July / early August, just preceding the release of \"Evangelion\".\nWhile filming the video in July, the band wanted to keep their fans informed by filming and posting &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Abehind%20the%20scenes\"&gt;behind the scene&lt;/a&gt; material.\nOn July 30 the trailer aired on &lt;a href=\"YouTube\"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, offering a glimpse into the theme of the video, followed by the premiere of the final video also on YouTube on August 6, just before the release of their album \"Evangelion\" which was released on August 7 in Europe.\nCensorship.\nOn August 7, 2009, a day after the premiere of the video, the &lt;a href=\"Censorship\"&gt;uncensored&lt;/a&gt; version of the video was removed from YouTube, causing a backlash from fans. The band uploaded a censored version of the video in response, and re-uploaded the original version to their &lt;a href=\"Metal%20Blade%20Records\"&gt;Metal Blade&lt;/a&gt; page using &lt;a href=\"Vimeo\"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;."
