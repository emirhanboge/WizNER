    "text": "Montan (; ) is a municipality with 1,701 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2018) in the South of &lt;a href=\"South%20Tyrol\"&gt;South Tyrol&lt;/a&gt; in northern Italy, about south of &lt;a href=\"Bolzano\"&gt;Bolzano&lt;/a&gt;. The name Montan comes from the Latin \"mons\" (\"mountain\").\nGeography.\nThe broad Cislon ridge with Montan, on a terrace, in front of it, as seen from the opposite Western side of the valley. \nThe municipality of Montan, totalling , extends on the orographically left, i.e. eastern flank of the South Tyrolean Lowlands (Unterland), as the section of the Adige valley between Bolzano and the &lt;a href=\"Salorno\"&gt;Salorno&lt;/a&gt; chasm is called. The main settlement areas are located on a wide hillside terrace, on which sits the main town of Montan (); somewhat south of it lie the two districts Pinzon () and Glen (). The Castelfeder hill () between &lt;a href=\"Neumarkt%2C%20South%20Tyrol\"&gt;Neumarkt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Auer%2C%20South%20Tyrol\"&gt;Auer&lt;/a&gt; protrudes west of the main town into the Adige valley. Below the hill, the municipality of Montan also occupies a small part of the valley floor up to the Adige river. \nTo the east of the main town, the terrain rises to the Cislon (), a ridge of the forested mountain range that is part of the &lt;a href=\"Fiemme%20Valley\"&gt;Fiemme Valley&lt;/a&gt;, which separates Unterland from Fiemme. This vast majority of this ridge is part of the protected Trudner Horn Nature Park and borders on the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Truden%20im%20Naturpark\"&gt;Truden&lt;/a&gt;. To the North, the Schwarzenbach valley forms the border to &lt;a href=\"Aldein\"&gt;Aldein&lt;/a&gt;; here, a narrow strip of the municipality encloses parts of Kaltenbrunn (). In the south, another strip of territory crosses the Truden stream valley and \u2013 bordering Neumarkt, Salorno, Truden and &lt;a href=\"Capriana\"&gt;Capriana&lt;/a&gt; in Trentino \u2013 occupies the northwestern slopes of the Trudner Horn (), where the small settlement of Gschnon () is located.\nFrazioni.\nThe municipality of Montan contains the \"&lt;a href=\"frazione\"&gt;frazioni&lt;/a&gt;\" (subdivisions, mainly villages and hamlets) Glen (Gleno), Gschnon (Casignano), Kaltenbrunn (Fontanefredde), Kalditsch (Doladizza), and Pinzon (Pinzano).\nCoat-of-arms.\nThe emblem represents an &lt;a href=\"lion%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;argent lion&lt;/a&gt;, with fixed eyes and claws of &lt;a href=\"or%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;or&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Azure%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;azure&lt;/a&gt;. It is the arms of the Lords of \"Enn\" who built the Castle in the twelfth century. The emblem was granted in 1967.\nHistory.\nFinds from the pre-Christian area show that early settlements in the Montan area date back to that period. Results from linguistics research in the field of place and field names support this assumption. Local names of pre-Roman (Gomaroa, Tschalfai) and Romanesque (Kalditsch, Montan, Glen, Pinzon) origin suggest a lively settlement activity in the centuries BC and AD.\nAround 955, Bavarian settlers began colonising the area. This colonisation culminated in the 12th century and ended in the mid-13th century. In 1133, the possession of the Weyarn monastery was registered at Enn court, as was the Sonnenburg monastery in Kalditsch in 1181. The lords of Enn made their first appearance in Montan in the mid-12th century. \nIn 1435, Pastor Hans Hach of Montan (\"her Hans Hach pharrer zu Mont\u00e6ny\") was a member of the South Tyrolean priesthood, which pledged to hold the Austrian anniversary in Holy Mary parish church in Bozen.\nUntil the end of the First World War, Montan belonged to the county of Tyrol and thus to the Austro-Hungarian empire. Within Tyrol, Montan was assigned to the Neumarkt judicial district, which in turn was part of the Bozen district. With the Treaty of Saint-Germain, Montan, along with most of Tyrol south of the main ridge of the Alps, was ceded to Italy in 1920. When these former Austrian territories became the two provinces of Bozen and Trento in 1927, Montan and other surrounding villages were assigned to the predominantly Italian-speaking province of Trento. It wasn't until 1948 that Montan became again part of the Province of Bozen/South Tyrol.\nLinguistic distribution.\nAccording to the 2011 census, 92.54% of the population speak German, 6.94% Italian and 0.52% &lt;a href=\"Ladin%20language\"&gt;Ladin&lt;/a&gt; as first language.\nEducation.\nThere is a German-language primary school in Montan, which is part of the school district of the neighbouring municipality of Auer.\nPolitics.\nHead of the municipality:\nActing Mayor: \nMayors since 1952:"
