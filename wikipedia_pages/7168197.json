    "text": "\"Shout It Out Loud\" is a song by the American &lt;a href=\"hard%20rock\"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"Kiss%20%28band%29\"&gt;Kiss&lt;/a&gt;, originally released on their &lt;a href=\"1976%20in%20music\"&gt;1976&lt;/a&gt; album, \"&lt;a href=\"Destroyer%20%28Kiss%20album%29\"&gt;Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;\". It was released as the lead single off the album, and it proved to be successful, becoming the band's second single to break the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;Top 40&lt;/a&gt;, after \"&lt;a href=\"Rock%20and%20Roll%20All%20Nite\"&gt;Rock and Roll All Nite&lt;/a&gt;\". It was also the band's first single to top the charts, as it reached number 1 hit in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; on May 22, 1976. The song was performed on almost every &lt;a href=\"Tour%20%28music%29\"&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt; for many years, and is one of the most played songs in the Kiss catalog, having been played over one thousand and four hundred times as of June 2014.\nOverview.\nThe title of the song was taken from British beat group &lt;a href=\"The%20Hollies\"&gt;The Hollies&lt;/a&gt;' song \"We Want to Shout It Out Loud\", which &lt;a href=\"Wicked%20Lester\"&gt;Wicked Lester&lt;/a&gt; (pre-Kiss) recorded for their only unreleased album.\nThe song was edited several times for singles and &lt;a href=\"compilation%20album\"&gt;compilation album&lt;/a&gt;s. The single version of the song is 12 seconds shorter than the studio due to the last \"Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud\" line being excluded. The \"&lt;a href=\"Alive%20II\"&gt;Alive II&lt;/a&gt;\" single, which was described by \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine as a \"raucous rocker\" that \"catches the excitement and energy of the live show,\" is 23 seconds shorter than the album song due to the removal of audience chant \"We want Kiss\". The \"&lt;a href=\"Killers%20%28Kiss%20album%29\"&gt;Killers&lt;/a&gt;\" version is the shortest with the duration of 2:35 as a result of the fade-out of the song starting during the first repetition of the \"Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud\" lyric following &lt;a href=\"Gene%20Simmons\"&gt;Gene Simmons&lt;/a&gt;' \"Oh yeah\". The version found on \"&lt;a href=\"Smashes%2C%20Thrashes%20%26amp%3B%20Hits\"&gt;Smashes, Thrashes &amp; Hits&lt;/a&gt;\" is 16 seconds longer, as the chorus repeats and the song ends with \"Shout it!\".\nReleased as a single in 1976, the band and their record company, &lt;a href=\"Casablanca%20Records\"&gt;Casablanca Records&lt;/a&gt;, were trying to cash in on the success of their previous single, the live version of \"Rock and Roll All Nite\", by releasing another anthem. While the song would break into the American \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" Top 40, peaking at #31, it would prove to not be as successful as its predecessor was but would remain in the band's concert set lists for almost every tour from that point on. In Canada, the single was far more successful, reaching #1 on the \"RPM\" national singles chart on May 22, 1976. The song is also one of few to be sung by both &lt;a href=\"Gene%20Simmons\"&gt;Gene Simmons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Stanley\"&gt;Paul Stanley&lt;/a&gt;. A music video was made for the live version of the song from the 1996 concert in &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Stadium%20%28Detroit%29\"&gt;Tiger Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"Alive/Worldwide%20Tour\"&gt;Alive/Worldwide Tour&lt;/a&gt;. It was directed by &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Isham\"&gt;Wayne Isham&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Cash%20Box\"&gt;Cash Box&lt;/a&gt;\" said that the studio version is \"straight ahead rock, complete with power riffs\" and that \"the vocals are clean and strong.\" It called the live single version a \"show-stopping concert [number], complete with explosion and crazed crowds.\"\nLegacy.\nThe song was performed on almost every tour since its release, being dropped for &lt;a href=\"Lick%20It%20Up%20Tour\"&gt;Lick It Up Tour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Animalize%20Tour\"&gt;Animalize Tour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asylum%20Tour%20%28Kiss%29\"&gt;Asylum Tour&lt;/a&gt;. It was listed as the 27th single of '76 in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.\nA 2007 re-recording of the song by the band is featured on the music/rhythm video game \"&lt;a href=\"Guitar%20Hero%205\"&gt;Guitar Hero 5&lt;/a&gt;\". The song is featured in the movie \"&lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Rock%20City%20%28film%29\"&gt;Detroit Rock City&lt;/a&gt;\" and appears on the soundtrack for the movie. The cast of &lt;a href=\"Glee%20%28TV%20Series%29\"&gt;\"Glee\"&lt;/a&gt; covered the song in the episode \"&lt;a href=\"Theatricality\"&gt;Theatricality&lt;/a&gt;\". The male part of the group (excluding &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Hummel\"&gt;Kurt Hummel&lt;/a&gt;) were also dressed as Kiss members. The song was also featured in a \"&lt;a href=\"What%27s%20New%2C%20Scooby-Doo%3F\"&gt;What's New, Scooby-Doo?&lt;/a&gt;\" episode \"A Scooby-Doo Halloween\".\nThe song was covered several times. In 1978 by &lt;a href=\"James%20Last\"&gt;James Last&lt;/a&gt;, in 1998 by &lt;a href=\"Pretty%20Boy%20Floyd%20%28American%20band%29\"&gt;Pretty Boy Floyd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zeke%20%28band%29\"&gt;Zeke&lt;/a&gt;. The all-female band &lt;a href=\"Crucified%20Barbara\"&gt;Crucified Barbara&lt;/a&gt; covered the song in 2006 and &lt;a href=\"Stryper\"&gt;Stryper&lt;/a&gt; released a cover of the song on their 2011 cover album \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Covering\"&gt;The Covering&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Gr%C3%B6nwall\"&gt;Erik Gr\u00f6nwall&lt;/a&gt;, the 2009 winner of the \"&lt;a href=\"Idol%20%28Sweden%29\"&gt;Swedish Idol&lt;/a&gt;\" covered the song on his &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Gr%C3%B6nwall\"&gt;eponymous debut album&lt;/a&gt;. While it was not released as a single, the song charted on &lt;a href=\"Sverigetopplistan\"&gt;Sverigetopplistan&lt;/a&gt;, reaching number 49. Gr\u00f6nwall also performed the song on \"Swedish Idol\". It was covered by &lt;a href=\"The%20Yellow%20Monkey\"&gt;The Yellow Monkey&lt;/a&gt; for the album in 1998, &lt;a href=\"Lemmy\"&gt;Lemmy&lt;/a&gt;'s cover appears on 2004's \"\", Sack Trick with &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Dickinson\"&gt;Bruce Dickinson&lt;/a&gt; covered the song for the 2005 \"Sheep in KISS Make Up\" album, and &lt;a href=\"Keri%20Kelli\"&gt;Keri Kelli&lt;/a&gt;'s cover appears on \"&lt;a href=\"Lick%20It%20Up%20%E2%80%93%20A%20Millennium%20Tribute%20to%20Kiss\"&gt;Lick It Up \u2013 A Millennium Tribute to Kiss&lt;/a&gt;\" from 2008.\nAppearances.\n\"Shout It Out Loud\" has appeared on following Kiss albums:\nCharts.\n&lt;a href=\"Kiss%20%28band%29\"&gt;Kiss&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Erik%20Gr%C3%B6nwall\"&gt;Erik Gr\u00f6nwall&lt;/a&gt;"
