    "text": "The townsite of Wonnerup is located south of &lt;a href=\"Perth\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; and east of &lt;a href=\"Busselton%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Busselton&lt;/a&gt;. It was gazetted a townsite in 1856, deriving its name from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Vasse-Wonnerup%20Estuary\"&gt;Wonnerup Inlet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name is &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australians\"&gt;Aboriginal&lt;/a&gt;, and has been shown on maps of the region since 1839. The meaning of the name is \"place of the woman's digging or fighting stick\"; the &lt;a href=\"Noongar\"&gt;Noongar&lt;/a&gt; word for fighting stick is \"wonna\", while the suffix \"&lt;a href=\"-up\"&gt;-up&lt;/a&gt;\" denotes \"place of\". The wonna was made from the peppermint tree, \"&lt;a href=\"Agonis%20flexuosa\"&gt;Agonis flexuosa&lt;/a&gt;\", a coastal native found only in the south-west, and was a common trade item of the Noongar people.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wonnerup%20massacre\"&gt;Wonnerup massacre&lt;/a&gt; of Wardandi Noongar people by European settlers occurred in the vicinity of the area in 1841. The &lt;a href=\"Ballaarat%20Tramline\"&gt;Ballaarat Tramline&lt;/a&gt;, Western Australia's first railway and railway bridge, was constructed in 1871 in the locality of Lockville, within Wonnerup. Wonnerup was later the junction of the &lt;a href=\"Bunbury%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Bunbury&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Busselton%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Busselton&lt;/a&gt; railway line and the &lt;a href=\"Nannup%20Branch%20Railway\"&gt;Nannup Branch Railway&lt;/a&gt;. In 1998, part of Wonnerup was subsumed into the Busselton suburb of &lt;a href=\"Geographe%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Geographe&lt;/a&gt;."
