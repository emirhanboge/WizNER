    "text": "Beth Run is a &lt;a href=\"tributary\"&gt;tributary&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bowman%20Creek\"&gt;Bowman Creek&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Luzerne%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Luzerne County, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, in the United States. It is approximately long and flows through &lt;a href=\"Ross%20Township%2C%20Luzerne%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Ross Township&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Township%2C%20Luzerne%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Lake Township&lt;/a&gt;. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The surficial geology along it consists of Wisconsinan Till and alluvium. The stream's watershed is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery and the stream is &lt;a href=\"Class%20A%20Wild%20Trout%20Waters\"&gt;Class A Wild Trout Waters&lt;/a&gt;.\nCourse.\nBeth Run begins at the head of a valley in Ross Township. It flows east-northeast for several tenths of a mile before turning northeast for several tenths of a mile and entering Lake Township. Here, the stream receives an unnamed tributary from the &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aright%20bank\"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt; and turns north for several tenths of a mile, its valley widening considerably. At the end of the valley, the stream reaches its confluence with Bowman Creek.\nBeth Run joins Bowman Creek upstream of its mouth.\nHydrology.\nThe concentration of &lt;a href=\"alkalinity\"&gt;alkalinity&lt;/a&gt; in Beth Run is .\nGeography and geology.\nThe elevation near the &lt;a href=\"river%20mouth\"&gt;mouth&lt;/a&gt; of Beth Run is above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;. The elevation of the stream's &lt;a href=\"river%20source\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; between above sea level.\nThe &lt;a href=\"surficial%20geology\"&gt;surficial geology&lt;/a&gt; along most of the length of Beth Run consists of a &lt;a href=\"till\"&gt;till&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Wisconsinan%20Till\"&gt;Wisconsinan Till&lt;/a&gt;. In the stream's upper reaches, &lt;a href=\"alluvium\"&gt;alluvium&lt;/a&gt; is present as well and some of the Wisconsinan Till is underlain by &lt;a href=\"glacial%20lake\"&gt;glacial lake&lt;/a&gt; clays. There is also a patch of Wisconsinan Bouldery Till at the headwaters; it is rich in &lt;a href=\"boulder\"&gt;boulder&lt;/a&gt;s. The surficial geology along the sides of the stream's valley includes &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; consisting of &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shale\"&gt;shale&lt;/a&gt;.\nWatershed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"drainage%20basin\"&gt;watershed&lt;/a&gt; of Beth Run has an area of . The stream is entirely within the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Geological%20Survey\"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quadrangle%20%28geography%29\"&gt;quadrangle&lt;/a&gt; of Sweet Valley.\nThe entire length of Beth Run is on public land that is open to access.\nHistory.\nBeth Run was entered into the &lt;a href=\"Geographic%20Names%20Information%20System\"&gt;Geographic Names Information System&lt;/a&gt; on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1169332.\nIn the 1970s, the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Game%20Commission\"&gt;Pennsylvania Game Commission&lt;/a&gt; was attempting to purchase a tract of land in the vicinity of Beth Run to add to &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20State%20Game%20Lands%20Number%2057\"&gt;Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 57&lt;/a&gt;. The Pennsylvania Game Commission also once requested a permit to construct an aluminum &lt;a href=\"box%20culvert\"&gt;box culvert&lt;/a&gt; bridge over the stream with the purpose of providing access to the southern parts of &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20State%20Game%20Lands%20Number%2057\"&gt;Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 57&lt;/a&gt; for tree salvage cutting.\nBiology.\nThe drainage basin of Beth Run is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild &lt;a href=\"trout\"&gt;trout&lt;/a&gt; naturally reproduce in the stream from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. It is classified by the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Fish%20and%20Boat%20Commission\"&gt;Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission&lt;/a&gt; as Class A Wild Trout Waters for &lt;a href=\"brook%20trout\"&gt;brook trout&lt;/a&gt; from its headwaters downstream to its mouth."
