    "text": "Ilex mitis (commonly called Cape holly, African holly, waterboom or umDuma) is a tall, dense, &lt;a href=\"Evergreen\"&gt;evergreen tree&lt;/a&gt; that is indigenous to &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Africa\"&gt;Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It makes an excellent fast-growing &lt;a href=\"hedge\"&gt;hedge&lt;/a&gt; for gardens - growing tall, straight and dense.\nAppearance.\nIf not pruned, \"Ilex mitis\" can grow to a height of 20 meters or more. Its trunk is straight, grey or brown and usually spotted while it produces a dense, even canopy. Young growth and leaf-stalks tend to be purple or red. The simply shaped, pointed, shiny-green leaves have wavy margins that are sometimes slightly serrated. The tree can be identified by its purple or maroon leaf stalks and the leaves\u2019 strongly impressed midribs.&lt;br&gt;\nThe small, white, scented &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s appear in spring. Ilex mitis is &lt;a href=\"dioecious\"&gt;dioecious&lt;/a&gt;, with separate male and female trees.&lt;br&gt;\nThe bright red &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt;s ripen in autumn, creating a colourful display and attracting a variety of birds.\nDistribution.\nThis is the only holly (\"Ilex\") species from &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, where it grows naturally in all provinces, from &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Town\"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; in the south, all the way up past &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malawi\"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt; in the north. \nIt is usually found growing on the banks of rivers and in moist spots in &lt;a href=\"Afromontane\"&gt;Afro-montane forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrowing \"Ilex mitis\".\nThis is a fast-growing tree, growing nearly a meter a year in ideal conditions. It grows especially well in wet areas like beside lakes or rivers and it tolerates frost, making it suitable for colder climates.\nFresh seed will usually germinate, but should first be dried out a bit. If kept moist after planting, the young plants usually sprout several weeks later. It transplants well, but needs to be protected from drying out and direct sun whilst young.\nIt has no known diseases or pests, though in the wild it is one of the favourite foods of &lt;a href=\"African%20elephant\"&gt;elephants&lt;/a&gt;."
