    "text": "John Banner (born Johann Banner, January 28, 1910\u00a0\u2013 January 28, 1973) was an Austrian-born American actor, best known for his role as Sergeant Schultz in the &lt;a href=\"situation%20comedy\"&gt;situation comedy&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Hogan%27s%20Heroes\"&gt;Hogan's Heroes&lt;/a&gt;\" (1965\u20131971). Schultz, constantly encountering evidence that the inmates of his &lt;a href=\"stalag\"&gt;stalag&lt;/a&gt; were planning mayhem, frequently feigned ignorance with the &lt;a href=\"catchphrase\"&gt;catchphrase&lt;/a&gt;, \"I see nothing! I hear nothing! I know nothing!\" (or, more commonly as the series went on, \"I know nothing, \"nothing!\"\").\nEarly years.\nBanner was born to &lt;a href=\"Jewish\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; parents in &lt;a href=\"Stanislau\"&gt;Stanislau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt; (now Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine). He studied for a &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Doctor\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; degree at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;University of Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, but decided instead to become an actor. In 1938, when he was performing with an acting troupe in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anschluss\"&gt;annexed Austria to Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Banner emigrated to the United States, where he rapidly learned English.\nWorld War II.\nIn 1942, Banner enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces\"&gt;United States Army Air Forces&lt;/a&gt;, underwent basic training in &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20City\"&gt;Atlantic City&lt;/a&gt; and became a supply sergeant. He even posed for a &lt;a href=\"recruiting%20poster\"&gt;recruiting poster&lt;/a&gt; (before he became portly). He served until 1945.\nAccording to fellow \"Hogan's Heroes\" actor &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Clary\"&gt;Robert Clary&lt;/a&gt;, who was a Holocaust survivor himself, \"John lost a lot of his family\" to &lt;a href=\"the%20Holocaust\"&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;.\nActing.\nBroadway.\nBanner appeared on &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20theatre\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; three times: in a musical revue called \"From Vienna\", which ran for two months in 1939; and in two comic plays, \"Pastoral\", in which he had a leading role, but which had a very brief run in November 1939; and \"The Big Two\", which ran briefly in January 1947. Early on, before he became fluent in English, Banner had to learn his lines phonetically.\nFilms.\nBanner appeared in more than 40 &lt;a href=\"feature%20film\"&gt;feature film&lt;/a&gt;s. His first credited role was a German captain in \"&lt;a href=\"Once%20Upon%20a%20Honeymoon\"&gt;Once Upon a Honeymoon&lt;/a&gt;\" (1942), starring &lt;a href=\"Cary%20Grant\"&gt;Cary Grant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ginger%20Rogers\"&gt;Ginger Rogers&lt;/a&gt;. He also played a &lt;a href=\"Gestapo\"&gt;Gestapo&lt;/a&gt; agent in &lt;a href=\"20th%20Century%20Fox\"&gt;20th Century Fox&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Chetniks%21%20The%20Fighting%20Guerrillas\"&gt;Chetniks! The Fighting Guerrillas&lt;/a&gt;\" (1943). His &lt;a href=\"typecasting%20%28acting%29\"&gt;typecasting&lt;/a&gt; did not please him, but these were the only roles he was offered. Banner later learned that his family members who remained in Vienna had all perished in &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20concentration%20camps\"&gt;Nazi concentration camps&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the 1950s.\nBanner made more than 70 television appearances between 1950 and 1970, including the \"&lt;a href=\"Lone%20Ranger\"&gt;Lone Ranger&lt;/a&gt;\" (episode \"Damsels In Distress\", 1950), \"&lt;a href=\"Sky%20King\"&gt;Sky King&lt;/a&gt;\" (premiere episode \"Operation Urgent\", 1952), \"&lt;a href=\"Sheena%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20Jungle\"&gt;Sheena, Queen of the Jungle&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Renegades\", 1955), \"&lt;a href=\"Adventures%20of%20Superman%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Adventures of Superman&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Man Who Made Dreams Come True\", 1957), \"&lt;a href=\"Father%20Knows%20Best\"&gt;Father Knows Best&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Brief Holiday\", 1957), \"&lt;a href=\"Mister%20Ed\"&gt;Mister Ed&lt;/a&gt;\" (episode \"Ed the Artist\", 1965), \"&lt;a href=\"Thriller%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Thriller&lt;/a&gt;\" (episode \"Portrait Without a Face\", 1961), \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Untouchables%20%281959%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Untouchables&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Takeover\", 1962), \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Sister%20Eileen%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;My Sister Eileen&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lucy%20Show\"&gt;The Lucy Show&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Perry%20Mason%20%281957%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Perry Mason&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Partridge%20Family\"&gt;The Partridge Family&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Voyage%20to%20the%20Bottom%20of%20the%20Sea%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Hot Line\", 1964), \"&lt;a href=\"Alias%20Smith%20and%20Jones\"&gt;Alias Smith and Jones&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20from%20U.N.C.L.E.\"&gt;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Neptune Affair\", 1964), and \"&lt;a href=\"Hazel%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Hazel&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Investor\", 1965).\nIn the late 1950s, a still-slim Banner portrayed &lt;a href=\"Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky\"&gt;Peter Tchaikovsky&lt;/a&gt;'s supervisor on a &lt;a href=\"Disneyland\"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt; anthology series about the composer's life. This followed a scene with fellow \"Hogan's Heroes\" actor &lt;a href=\"Leon%20Askin\"&gt;Leon Askin&lt;/a&gt; (General Burkhalter) as &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Rubinstein\"&gt;Nikolai Rubinstein&lt;/a&gt;. In 1953, he had a bit part in the &lt;a href=\"Kirk%20Douglas\"&gt;Kirk Douglas&lt;/a&gt; feature film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Juggler%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Juggler&lt;/a&gt;\" as the witness of an attack on an Israeli policeman by a disturbed concentration camp survivor.\nIn 1954, he had a regular role playing Bavarro in the children's &lt;a href=\"science%20fiction\"&gt;science-fiction&lt;/a&gt; TV series \"&lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Jones%2C%20Space%20Ranger\"&gt;Rocky Jones, Space Ranger&lt;/a&gt;\". Two years later, he played a train conductor in the episode \"Safe Conduct\" of \"&lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Hitchcock%20Presents\"&gt;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&lt;/a&gt;\", appearing with future co-star &lt;a href=\"Werner%20Klemperer\"&gt;Werner Klemperer&lt;/a&gt; (Colonel Klink in \"Hogan's Heroes\"), who played a spy. He also played Nazi villains in several later films - the German town mayor in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Young%20Lions%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Young Lions&lt;/a&gt;\" (1958), &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20H%C3%B6ss\"&gt;Rudolf H\u00f6ss&lt;/a&gt; in \"Operation Eichmann\" (1961), and &lt;a href=\"Gregor%20Strasser\"&gt;Gregor Strasser&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Hitler%20%281962%20film%29\"&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt;\" (1962). The year before the premiere of \"Hogan's Heroes\", Banner portrayed a World War II German \"home guard\" soldier in \"&lt;a href=\"36%20Hours%20%281965%20film%29\"&gt;36 Hours&lt;/a&gt;\" (1964), starring &lt;a href=\"James%20Garner\"&gt;James Garner&lt;/a&gt;. Although it was a serious role in a war drama, Banner still displayed some of the affable nature that became his defining character trait the following year in \"Hogan's Heroes\". By coincidence, during the final moments of \"36 Hours\", John Banner's character meets up with a border guard played by &lt;a href=\"Sig%20Ruman\"&gt;Sig Ruman&lt;/a&gt;, who had portrayed another prisoner-of-war camp chief guard named Sergeant Schulz in the 1953 film \"&lt;a href=\"Stalag%2017\"&gt;Stalag 17&lt;/a&gt;\", starring &lt;a href=\"William%20Holden\"&gt;William Holden&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Hogan's Heroes\".\nThe comedy series \"Hogan's Heroes\", in which Banner played Sergeant Hans Schultz, the role for which he is most often remembered, debuted on the &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Television%20Network\"&gt;CBS Television Network&lt;/a&gt; in 1965. According to Banner, before he met and married his French wife Christine, he weighed ; he claimed her good cooking was responsible for his weight gain to , which helped him land the part. The character of Schultz is a bumbling, but ultimately lovable German guard at a World War II prisoner-of-war camp. The camp is used by the prisoners as a secret staging area for sabotage and intelligence gathering. Schultz is forever becoming indebted to the prisoners, which they use to the Allies' advantage for their continuing espionage work. His main goal is to avoid any trouble with his superiors, which often leads him to ignore the clandestine activities of the prisoners. (On those occasions, he often used his &lt;a href=\"catchphrase\"&gt;catchphrase&lt;/a&gt; \"I hear nothing, I see nothing, I know nothing!\" As the series went on, this became simply \"I know nothing. Nothing\"!). The genesis of the line could be from Banner\u2019s appearance on the TV crime drama \"The Untouchables\", in the episode \"The Takeover\" (1961), when confronted by a gangster, he nervously responds with his future classic line. Another signature phrase used was \"Jolly joker!\", when one of the POWs would make a joke at his expense.\nBanner was loved not only by the viewers, but also by the cast, as recalled by cast members during the \"Hogan's Heroes\" &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; commentary. The Jewish Banner defended his character, telling \"&lt;a href=\"TV%20Guide\"&gt;TV Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1967, \"Schultz is not a Nazi. I see Schultz as the representative of some kind of goodness in any generation.\" Banner appeared in every episode of the series, which ran for six years.\nIn 1968, during the series' run, Banner co-starred with fellow \"Hogan's Heroes\" actors Werner Klemperer, Leon Askin, and &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Crane\"&gt;Bob Crane&lt;/a&gt; in the Cold War comedy \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wicked%20Dreams%20of%20Paula%20Schultz\"&gt;The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz&lt;/a&gt;\", starring &lt;a href=\"Elke%20Sommer\"&gt;Elke Sommer&lt;/a&gt; in the title role.\nAfter \"Hogan's Heroes\".\nAfter \"Hogan's Heroes\" was cancelled in 1971, Banner starred as the inept gangster Uncle Latzi in a short-lived television &lt;a href=\"situation%20comedy\"&gt;situation comedy&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Chicago%20Teddy%20Bears\"&gt;The Chicago Teddy Bears&lt;/a&gt;\". His last acting appearance was in the March 17, 1972, episode of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Partridge%20Family\"&gt;The Partridge Family&lt;/a&gt;\". He then retired to France with his Paris-born second wife.\nDeath.\nLess than one year after moving back to Europe, while visiting friends in Vienna, Banner died on his 63rd birthday following an abdominal &lt;a href=\"hemorrhage\"&gt;hemorrhage&lt;/a&gt;.\nReferences.\nNotes"
