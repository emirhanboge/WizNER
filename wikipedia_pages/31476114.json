However, due to fixture congestion, they only played 24 matches, with the remaining fixtures all being awarded as 0\u20130 draws. Yeovil &amp; Petters United were renamed Yeovil Town at the end of the previous season.\nA total of 17 clubs contest the division, including nine clubs from previous season, three clubs missed previous season and five new clubs.\nClubs missed previous season:\nNewly elected clubs:\n&lt;a href=\"Gillingham%20F.C.\"&gt;Gillingham&lt;/a&gt; were champions, winning their first Southern League title. At the end of the season &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20F.C.\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt; resigned from the league.\nLeague table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFootball League elections.\nBarry Town, Bath City, Chelmsford City, Colchester United, Gillingham, Gravesend &amp; Northfleet, Guildford City, Merthyr Tydfil, Worcester City and Yeovil Town were amongst 27 non-League clubs to apply for election to the Football League. However, as the two clubs relegated from Division Two to the regional divisions Three were both from the south, the Football League secretary had suggested that electing new members could create an imbalance in the divisions' geographical boundaries, and that instead all four clubs (Halifax, Mansfield, Norwich and Southport) should be re-elected en bloc. This was accepted and no elections took place."
