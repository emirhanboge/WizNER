    "text": "Delio Onnis (born 24 March 1948) is a former professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player who played as &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Striker\"&gt;striker&lt;/a&gt;. Born in Italy, his family emigrated to Argentina in his youth and he was nicknamed \"El Tano\" (the Italian) in Argentina.\nWith 299 goals, he is the all-time top &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Ligue%201%20records%20and%20statistics%23Goalscorers\"&gt;highest goalscorer&lt;/a&gt; in the history of &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;Ligue 1&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and was the league's top scorer on 5 different occasions. He played the majority of his career for &lt;a href=\"Stade%20de%20Reims\"&gt;Stade de Reims&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AS%20Monaco\"&gt;AS Monaco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tours%20FC\"&gt;Tours FC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20Toulon%20Var\"&gt;Sporting Toulon Var&lt;/a&gt;. With Monaco he won one league title and one &lt;a href=\"Coupe%20de%20France\"&gt;Coupe de France&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nOnnis was born in Giuliano di Roma in Italy, but moved to Argentina before he was 3 and subsequently gained Argentinian citizenship. Beginning his football career as a youth player for &lt;a href=\"Club%20Almagro\"&gt;Club Almagro&lt;/a&gt;, he made a successful transition to the senior team and subsequently earned a move to &lt;a href=\"Gimnasia%20La%20Plata\"&gt;Gimnasia La Plata&lt;/a&gt; where he played alongside players like &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Zywica\"&gt;Roberto Zywica&lt;/a&gt;. He was the star striker for the team that finished third in 1970 which brought him to the attention of scouts from Europe.\nIn 1971 he joined &lt;a href=\"Stade%20de%20Reims\"&gt;Stade de Reims&lt;/a&gt; at the same time as his compatriot Zywica, finishing his first season with 22 goals and his second season with 17. In 1974 the newly promoted &lt;a href=\"AS%20Monaco\"&gt;AS Monaco&lt;/a&gt; signed him and over the next 7 seasons he was their top scorer every year, eventually scoring 223 goals, with 157 in the league. In 1976 the club were relegated, but Onnis stayed with them and helped them regain their top flight status for the &lt;a href=\"1977%E2%80%9378%20French%20Division%201\"&gt;1977-78&lt;/a&gt; season that saw them finish as league champions, and the following season win the Coupe de France.\nIn 1980, despite playing in one of the best teams in &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;Division 1&lt;/a&gt;, he signed for newly promoted and inexperienced team &lt;a href=\"FC%20Tours\"&gt;FC Tours&lt;/a&gt;, where he was twice again &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;Division 1&lt;/a&gt; leading goalscorer. In 1983 Tours were relegated, and as a result he joined &lt;a href=\"SC%20Toulon\"&gt;SC Toulon&lt;/a&gt;, where he finished his career in 1986.\nInternational career.\nOnnis was never called up for Argentina which had a policy of favouring players who remained in the domestic league, and throughout the 70s and 80s he, like &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Bianchi\"&gt;Carlos Bianchi&lt;/a&gt;, was behind compatriots such as &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Kempes\"&gt;Mario Kempes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leopoldo%20Luque\"&gt;Leopoldo Luque&lt;/a&gt; in the pecking order Argentinian.\nScoring titles.\nCarlos Bianchi had been signed as his replacement at Reims in 1973\u201374. Bianchi went on to win five scoring titles over the next six seasons, including four back-to-back between 1975 and 1979, Onnis breaking Bianchi's run in 1974\u201375. Following Bianchi's return to Argentina in 1980, Onnis went on to win four back-to-back scoring titles of his own, leaving them with five apiece and meaning that in 11 seasons between 1973\u201374 and 1983\u201384 they won five scoring titles each with only &lt;a href=\"Vahid%20Halilhod%C5%BEi%C4%87\"&gt;Vahid Halilhod\u017ei\u0107&lt;/a&gt;'s win in 1982 for &lt;a href=\"FC%20Nantes\"&gt;FC Nantes&lt;/a&gt; breaking their dominance."
