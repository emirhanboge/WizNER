    "text": "\"Juicio Final\" (1991) (&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; for \"Final Judgement\") was a &lt;a href=\"professional%20wrestling\"&gt;professional wrestling&lt;/a&gt; major show event produced by &lt;a href=\"Consejo%20Mundial%20de%20Lucha%20Libre\"&gt;Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre&lt;/a&gt; (CMLL) that took place on December 13, 1991 in &lt;a href=\"Arena%20M%C3%A9xico\"&gt;Arena M\u00e9xico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City%2C%20Mexico\"&gt;Mexico City, Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Documentation foronly three matches on the show have been found, the main event and two &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20tag%20team%20match%20types%23Trios%20rules%20%28Relevos%20Australianos%29\"&gt;Six-man \"Lucha Libre rules\" tag team match&lt;/a&gt; undercard matches. The show served as the year-end finale for CMLL before Arena M\u00e9xico, CMLL's main venue, closed down for the winter for renovations and to host \" Circo Atayde \". The shows replaced the regular \"&lt;a href=\"CMLL%20Super%20Viernes\"&gt;Super Viernes&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Super Friday\") shows held by CMLL since the mid-1930s. This was the third year that CMLL used the name \"Jucio Final\" for their year-end show, a name they would use on a regular basis going forward, originally for their year even events but later on held at other points in the year.\nThe main event of \"Juicio Final\" was a \"&lt;a href=\"Lucha%20de%20Apuestas\"&gt;Lucha de Apuestas&lt;/a&gt;\", mask vs. mask match between &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A1scara%20A%C3%B1o%202000\"&gt;M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"An%C3%ADbal\"&gt;An\u00edbal&lt;/a&gt;. The match saw M\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000 defeat An\u00edbal, forcing him to unmask and reveal his real name, Carlos Ignacio Carrillo Contreras, after the match per Lucha libre traditions. The first of two six-man tag team matches was built around the feud between &lt;a href=\"Kato%20Kung%20Lee\"&gt;Kato Kung Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kung%20Fu%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Kung Fu&lt;/a&gt; as they each captained a team for the match. Kato Kung Lee teamed with &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20National%20Tag%20Team%20Championship\"&gt;Mexican National Tag Team Champions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Misterioso%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Misterioso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Super%20Parka\"&gt;Volador&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Kung Fu, &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Panther\"&gt;Blue Panther&lt;/a&gt; and Herodes. The other six man tag team match saw three of CMLL's top \"tecnicos\" in &lt;a href=\"Atlantis%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dos%20Caras\"&gt;Dos Caras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Konnan\"&gt;Konnan&lt;/a&gt;, defeat one of CMLL's top \"rudo\" trios \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Infernales\"&gt;Los Infernales&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"El%20Sat%C3%A1nico\"&gt;El Sat\u00e1nico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MS-1%20%28wrestler%29\"&gt;MS-1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pirata%20Morgan\"&gt;Pirata Morgan&lt;/a&gt;).\nProduction.\nBackground.\nFor decades &lt;a href=\"Arena%20M%C3%A9xico\"&gt;Arena M\u00e9xico&lt;/a&gt;, the main venue of the Mexican &lt;a href=\"professional%20wrestling%20promotion\"&gt;professional wrestling promotion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Consejo%20Mundial%20de%20Lucha%20Libre\"&gt;Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre&lt;/a&gt; (CMLL), would close down in early December and remain closed into either January or February to allow for renovations as well as letting \"Circo Atayde\" occupy the space over the holidays. As a result CMLL usually held a \"end of the year\" &lt;a href=\"supercard\"&gt;supercard&lt;/a&gt; show on the first or second Friday of December in lieu of their normal \"&lt;a href=\"CMLL%20Super%20Viernes\"&gt;Super Viernes&lt;/a&gt;\" show. 1955 was the first year where CMLL used the name \"El Juicio Final\" (\"The Final Judgement\") for their year-end supershow. Until 2000 the \"Jucio Final\" name was always used for the year end show, but since 2000 has at times been used for shows outside of December. It is no longer an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All \"Juicio Final\" shows have been held in &lt;a href=\"Arena%20M%C3%A9xico\"&gt;Arena M\u00e9xico&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City, Mexico&lt;/a&gt; which is CMLL's main venue, its \"home\".\nStorylines.\nThe 1991 \"Juicio Final\" show featured five &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types\"&gt;professional wrestling matches&lt;/a&gt; scripted by CMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. The wrestlers portray either &lt;a href=\"Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;heels&lt;/a&gt; (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that play the part of the \"bad guys\") or &lt;a href=\"Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;faces&lt;/a&gt; (\"t\u00e9cnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they perform.\nStorylines.\nThe event featured at least three &lt;a href=\"Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types\"&gt;professional wrestling matches&lt;/a&gt; with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing &lt;a href=\"Screenplay\"&gt;scripted&lt;/a&gt; feuds, &lt;a href=\"plot%20%28narrative%29\"&gt;plots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"narrative%20thread\"&gt;storylines&lt;/a&gt;. Wrestlers were portrayed as either &lt;a href=\"Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;heels&lt;/a&gt; (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or &lt;a href=\"Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29\"&gt;faces&lt;/a&gt; (\"t\u00e9cnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. It is likely that more matches took place but no documentation has been found to confirm what those matches were."
