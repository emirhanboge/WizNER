    "text": "Harold Anthony Caccia, Baron Caccia, (21 December 1905 &lt;a href=\"Pachmarhi\"&gt;Pachmarhi&lt;/a&gt;, India \u2013 31 October 1990 &lt;a href=\"Builth%20Wells\"&gt;Builth Wells&lt;/a&gt;, Wales) was a British diplomat.\nHe was educated at &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Fields%20School\"&gt;Summer Fields School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton College&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20College%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;Trinity College, Oxford&lt;/a&gt; and won a &lt;a href=\"Blue%20%28university%20sport%29\"&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt;, playing at &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23centre\"&gt;centre&lt;/a&gt; for Oxford in the &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20match\"&gt;Varsity match&lt;/a&gt; in 1926. He played &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Oxfordshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Oxfordshire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Counties%20Championship\"&gt;Minor Counties Championship&lt;/a&gt; between 1928 and 1938. In 1932 he married Anne Catherine Barstow, daughter of &lt;a href=\"George%20Barstow\"&gt;Sir George Barstow&lt;/a&gt; and Enid Lillian Lawrence.\nCaccia entered the diplomatic service in 1929 and was posted to Peking and then to Athens and London where, in 1936, he became assistant private secretary to &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Eden\"&gt;Anthony Eden&lt;/a&gt;. He was back in Athens early in World War II, but was then attached to the staff of &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Macmillan\"&gt;Harold Macmillan&lt;/a&gt;, Britain's representative at Allied headquarters in North Africa. The &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Greek Civil War&lt;/a&gt; once again saw him in that country, and by 1945 his services earned him recognition on the Birthday Honours List.\nCaccia was &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Ambassadors%20from%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20Austria\"&gt;Ambassador to Austria&lt;/a&gt; from 1951 to 1954, and from 1956 to 1961 &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Ambassadors%20from%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Ambassador to the United States&lt;/a&gt;. He was sent to Washington to repair relations badly damaged by the &lt;a href=\"Suez%20crisis\"&gt;Suez crisis&lt;/a&gt; of 1956. The breakdown in mutual confidence arose when Britain and France joined an Israeli invasion of Egypt and sent military forces to capture the Suez Canal, which had been nationalised by President &lt;a href=\"Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser\"&gt;Gamal Abdel Nasser&lt;/a&gt; of Egypt. In the years that followed, he was instrumental in restoring and nurturing the \"special relationship\" between London and Washington.\nHis daughter Clarissa married &lt;a href=\"David%20Pryce-Jones\"&gt;David Pryce-Jones&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Pryce-Jones\"&gt;Alan Pryce-Jones&lt;/a&gt; and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Fould-Springer (\"Poppy\").\nIn 1961, he became &lt;a href=\"Permanent%20Under-Secretary%20of%20State\"&gt;Permanent Under-Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt;, an office he held until 1965. He was &lt;a href=\"Provost%20of%20Eton\"&gt;Provost of Eton&lt;/a&gt; 1965-78 and President of the &lt;a href=\"Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Marylebone Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt; (MCC) in 1973\u201374.\nHe was knighted in 1950, and was created a &lt;a href=\"life%20peer\"&gt;life peer&lt;/a&gt; with the title Baron Caccia, \"of &lt;a href=\"Abernant%2C%20Powys\"&gt;Abernant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Brecknock\"&gt;County of Brecknock&lt;/a&gt;\", on 11 May 1965. Caccia was appointed a &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Grand%20Cross\"&gt;Bailiff&lt;/a&gt; Grand Cross and Lord Prior of the &lt;a href=\"Venerable%20Order%20of%20Saint%20John\"&gt;Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, a Knight Grand Cross of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Victorian%20Order\"&gt;Royal Victorian Order&lt;/a&gt; and a Knight Grand Cross of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George\"&gt;Order of St Michael and St George&lt;/a&gt;.
