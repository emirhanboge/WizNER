    "text": "White Horse Temple () is a Buddhist temple in &lt;a href=\"Luoyang\"&gt;Luoyang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henan\"&gt;Henan&lt;/a&gt; that, according to tradition, is the first &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; temple in China, having been first established in 68 AD under the patronage of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Ming%20of%20Han\"&gt;Emperor Ming&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Han\"&gt;Eastern Han&lt;/a&gt; dynasty.\nThe site is just outside the walls of the ancient Eastern Han capital, some east of &lt;a href=\"Luoyang\"&gt;Luoyang&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Henan%20Province\"&gt;Henan Province&lt;/a&gt;. It is approximately 40 minutes by bus No. 56 from Luoyang railway station. The temple, although small in comparison to many others in China, is considered by most believers as \"the cradle of Chinese Buddhism\". The geographical landmarks to the south are Manghan mountain and Lucoche River.\nThe main temple buildings, a large complex, were reconstructed during the &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ming&lt;/a&gt; (1368 to 1644) and &lt;a href=\"Qing%20Dynasty\"&gt;Qing&lt;/a&gt; (1644 to 1912) dynasties. They were refurbished in the 1950s, and again in March 1973 after the &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20Revolution\"&gt;Cultural Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. It has numerous halls divided by courtyards and manicured gardens, covering an area of about . The display plaques in &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20language\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; and English give ample descriptions of the Buddhist deities installed in the halls. Significant statues include &lt;a href=\"%C5%9A%C4%81kyamuni\"&gt;\u015a\u0101kyamuni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buddha\"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Budai\"&gt;Maitreya&lt;/a&gt; (the laughing Buddha in China), &lt;a href=\"Amit%C4%81bha\"&gt;Amit\u0101bha&lt;/a&gt;, the Jade Buddha, Bodhisattvas such as &lt;a href=\"Guanyin\"&gt;Guanyin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"arhats\"&gt;arhats&lt;/a&gt; and stone statues of the two white horses which brought the Indian monks to China and two mythical lions at the entrance. Under international funding, the temple has undergone many changes, both structurally and internally. The most recent cooperative project, with India, was completed in 2008 when the &lt;a href=\"Sanchi\"&gt;Sanchi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stupa\"&gt;Stupa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sarnath\"&gt;Sarnath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buddha\"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; statue were erected.\nEtymology.\nOn arrival of the two monks from India, they were housed in the temple. This temple was called the \"Pi-ma-sai\" meaning \"White Horse Temple\" where 'pi' means \"white\", 'ma' means \"horse\" and 'sai' or 'ssi' is \"temple\". 'Ssi' in Chinese also means residence of &lt;a href=\"Buddhist%20priest\"&gt;Buddhist priest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNotably, the emperor ordered the suffix () to be used in the temple's name, as a display of respect. This character had been used to denote the ministries of the government. In later periods, all temples, even &lt;a href=\"mosque\"&gt;mosque&lt;/a&gt;s, came to use this character in their name and it was dropped from the names of government ministries. As a result, the temple's name is sometimes translated as \"White Horse Ministry\", a translation true to the time. \"White Horse Temple\" is the modern, literal reading.\nHowever, this may be a &lt;a href=\"folk%20etymology\"&gt;folk etymology&lt;/a&gt; as there were other early temples in different centres with the same name. The monk Zhidun (or Chih Tun) (314\u2013366), who was a famous propagator of Buddhism in the southern capital is recorded as having discussions with Fenghui at the Baima si (Pai ma) monastery in &lt;a href=\"Jiankang\"&gt;Jiankang&lt;/a&gt; (previously Jianye), the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Jin\"&gt;Eastern Jin&lt;/a&gt; (317-420). There was also a Baima si at &lt;a href=\"Xiangyang\"&gt;Xiangyang&lt;/a&gt; where Daoan and his disciples stayed c. 365. To further complicate the search for the origin of the name, there were peoples known as the 'White Horse Qiang' and 'Di' who lived in the 'White Horse Valley' on the upper reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Min%20River%20%28Sichuan%29\"&gt;Min River&lt;/a&gt;, which flows south from the &lt;a href=\"Min%20Mountains\"&gt;Min Mountains&lt;/a&gt; near the town of Zhangla ([Chang-la]: 32.50\u00b0 N, 103.40\u00b0 E) and there are still people calling themselves the 'White Horse Di' living there. It is possible, but unprovable, that the name Baima derived from some of these peoples, who may have been influenced by Buddhism at an early period, rather than from literal white horse(s) carrying scriptures.\nBackground, legends and importance.\nHere are several forms of the legends relating to the foundation and naming of the temple:\nAccording to 'The Chapter on the Western Regions' of the \"&lt;a href=\"Hou%20Hanshu\"&gt;Hou Hanshu&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Book of Later Han\"), which was based on a report to the Emperor , but was not compiled until the 5th century: \nThere are differing accounts explaining how the temple was established. Yang Hs\u00fcan-chih says in the preface to his book, \"A Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Lo-yang\" (completed \"c\". 547 CE), that, after his dream, Emperor Ming ordered that statues of the Buddha be erected at the [K'ai-]yang Gate (Opening to the Morning Sun Gate) of the Southern Palace and on near the [Ch'ang]yeh Terrace (The Eternal Night Terrace). He, however, makes no mention of the temple.\nThe Emperor is said to have sent a monk or monks to India or &lt;a href=\"Scythia\"&gt;Scythia&lt;/a&gt; who returned carrying the &lt;a href=\"Sutra%20of%20Forty-two%20Chapters\"&gt;Sutra of Forty-two Chapters&lt;/a&gt; on a white horse. The Sutra was received by the Emperor and housed in a temple built outside the walls of Luo Yang. It was China's first Buddhist temple.\nOther versions mentioned in the book \"Indian Pandits in the Land of Snow\" by Sri Sarat Chandra give the following legendary versions:\nThe legends related to this temple have direct link to the emergence and spread of Buddhism in China. Two visions are stated in this context.\nThe first vision was witnessed by Chow Wang, the fifth ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20dynasty\"&gt;Tang dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor saw, in the southwestern region of China, a very bright light in the sky, like a halo or &lt;a href=\"aureola\"&gt;aureola&lt;/a&gt; from the west which lit the whole space. The astrologers of his court predicted that a saint was born in that quarter of the world where he saw the bright halo light. It was also prophesied that the religion practised by the saintly person, would spread to China. This was recorded by the King in his royal register. This year happened to be the year when Gautam Buddha was born in Nepal. \nThe second vision happened at Luo Yang during the reign of Mingdi, the second Emperor of the Eastern &lt;a href=\"Han%20Dynasty\"&gt;Han Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. In 60 CE, on an auspicious day, the Emperor had a vision (dream) of a saintly person of golden complexion with the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; shining behind his back came near his throne from the heavens and then circled his palace. This incident was correlated with the ancient recorded version and the events were interpreted to mean that the period prophesied in the past, of Buddhism coming to China, was now. History chronicler Fu Hi interpreted this vision as that of the divine person known as Buddha who was born in a place to the west of China in India. Emperor Mingdi forthwith selected emissaries named Taai Yin, Tain King, Wangtrun and others, in all 18 people, to go toward the west to India in search of the religion practiced by Buddha. After travelling through several countries bordering India such as Getse and &lt;a href=\"Yuchi\"&gt;Yuchi&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Saka\"&gt;Saka&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tartars\"&gt;Tartars&lt;/a&gt;), they reached (&lt;a href=\"Gandhara\"&gt;Gandhara&lt;/a&gt; country) where they met two &lt;a href=\"Buddhist%20monks\"&gt;Buddhist monks&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Arhats\"&gt;Arhats&lt;/a&gt;) named Kasyapa Pandita (a &lt;a href=\"Brahmin\"&gt;Brahmin&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Central%20India\"&gt;Central India&lt;/a&gt;) and Bharana Pandita from South India. They accepted the invitation of the emissaries to go to China. They then proceeded to China on two white horses accompanied by the emissaries. They carried with them a few sacred texts of sutras \u2014 the \"Sutra of Forty-two Chapters\" \u2014 statues of Buddha, portraits and sacred relics. They reached Lou Yang where they were put up in a temple. The King met them in 67 CE, with due reverence and was pleased with the presents the monks had brought for him. It was the 30th day in the 12th month of &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20calendar\"&gt;Chinese calendar&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor was particularly happy with the Buddha image which had striking similarity to the one he had seen in his dream vision. At this time, the monks performed some miracles, which further strengthened the belief of the Emperor in Buddhism.\nHowever, some &lt;a href=\"Taoist\"&gt;Taoist&lt;/a&gt; priests protested and wanted the Emperor to test the merits of both parties. The Emperor agreed and convened a meeting at the southern gate of the White Horse Temple. He ordered that the sacred texts and religious paraphernalia of the Taoists be placed on the eastern gate and the sacred texts, relics and Buddha image of the westerners in the hall of seven gems on the west. He then ordered that the objects be thrown into the fire, and whichever documents survived the fire then that religion would receive his patronage. The Taoists expected that their texts would survive. This did not happen as all the texts of Taoists were burnt and that of the Buddhists from the west survived. With this test, the Emperor was convinced of the Buddhist religion. He with all his entourage of ministers and kinsmen embraced Buddhism. He built several temples, which included 'Pai-masai', the White Horse Temple and three convents for nuns.\nNow that there are many contradictory versions of this story, most modern scholars accept it as a Buddhist fable and not a valid historical event. The White Horse Temple is not recorded in contemporary sources before 289. However, there is a Poma si mentioned in &lt;a href=\"Chang%27an\"&gt;Chang'an&lt;/a&gt; in 266 and another of the same name at Jingcheng in central &lt;a href=\"Hubei\"&gt;Hubei&lt;/a&gt; at about the same date.\nIt is said that the next year, the Emperor ordered the construction of the White Horse Temple on the south side of the Imperial Drive three \"&lt;a href=\"li%20%28unit%29\"&gt;li&lt;/a&gt;\" outside the Hsi-yang Gate of the capital &lt;a href=\"Luoyang\"&gt;Luoyang&lt;/a&gt;, to remember the horse that carried back the sutras. After the death of the Emperor a meditation hall was built on his tomb. In front of the stupa luxuriant pomegranate and grape vines were grown which were said to be larger than those elsewhere.\nBuddhism evolved in China after arriving from India, as a blend of Chinese beliefs and needs, particularly in respect of its folk heritage. It is &lt;a href=\"Mahayana%20Buddhism\"&gt;Mahayana Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; practice, which is widely followed even though the &lt;a href=\"Theravada\"&gt;Theravada&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hinayana\"&gt;Hinayana&lt;/a&gt; came to China first.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn 258 a royal &lt;a href=\"Kucha\"&gt;Kuchean&lt;/a&gt; monk, Po-Yen, translated six Buddhist texts into &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20language\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; at the temple, including the important \"&lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Life%20Sutra\"&gt;Infinite Life Sutra&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe famous Indo-Scythian Buddhist translator &lt;a href=\"Dharmarak%E1%B9%A3a\"&gt;Dharmarak\u1e63a&lt;/a&gt; (), active ca. 266\u2013308 CE, came to Luoyang in 266 and resided at the White Horse Temple from at least the spring of 289 to 290 CE.\nFurthermore, the renowned monk &lt;a href=\"Xuanzang\"&gt;Xuanzang&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20dynasty\"&gt;Tang dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, who spent 16 years on a pilgrimage to India (630\u2013635 CE) as a result of his desire to visit the Buddha's homeland, started his pilgrimage from this temple. On his return, Xuanzang remained the &lt;a href=\"abbot\"&gt;abbot&lt;/a&gt; of the White Horse Temple till his death. During his stay, apart from his teaching duties and other religious activities at the temple, he translated many Buddhist scriptures that he had brought from India, skillfully rendering Sanskrit into Chinese.\nIn 1175, an inscription on a stone tablet next to Qilun Pagoda\u2014a tall, multi-eaved square-based tower to the southeast of the White Horse Temple\u2014stated that a fire occurred five decades previously and destroyed the temple and the Sakya Tathagata sarira &lt;a href=\"stupa\"&gt;stupa&lt;/a&gt;, a predecessor to the pagoda. The same inscription of 1175 stated that a &lt;a href=\"Jin%20dynasty%20%281115%E2%80%931234%29\"&gt;Jin&lt;/a&gt; official had the stone Qilun Pagoda erected soon after. The &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20pagoda\"&gt;pagoda&lt;/a&gt; is built with the design style imitating the square-based pagodas of the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Dynasty\"&gt;Tang Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween the 13th century and the 20th century, the temple underwent restoration/renovation under the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) and the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911). Significant restoration took place in the 16th century and some buildings date to this period, although some have since been renovated.\nModern history.\nUnder the People's Republic of China, the temple has seen many renovations in the period between 1952 and 1973 following the &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20Revolution\"&gt;Cultural Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. The Cultural Revolution had left the temple ravaged and emptied of relics, with many buildings burnt down.\nIn 1973, Prince &lt;a href=\"Norodom%20Sihanouk\"&gt;Norodom Sihanouk&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cambodia\"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt; visited the temple. Cambodia was a communist ally of China and Prince Sihanouk was staying in a palatial residence in &lt;a href=\"Beijing\"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;. He was permitted to visit parts of the country on a tour for propaganda purposes, to show to the outside world that all was normal within China. As an ardent Buddhist, Sihanouk expressed a wish to Premier &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Enlai\"&gt;Zhou Enlai&lt;/a&gt; to visit the White Horse Temple. This put the administration into a frenzy, since many parts of the temple had been damaged during the &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20Revolution\"&gt;Cultural Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and items were missing. Post haste, 2900 artefacts, which were in other palaces and museums in China, such as the Palace of Benevolent Tranquillity on the western side of the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20City\"&gt;Forbidden City&lt;/a&gt; and statues in the Arhat Hall (\"Luohan Tang\") of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Azure%20Clouds\"&gt;Temple of Azure Clouds&lt;/a&gt; in Beijing's &lt;a href=\"Fragrant%20Hills\"&gt;Fragrant Hills&lt;/a&gt; were secretly shifted to the temple, and the White Horse Temple was fully restored. The newly restored temple impressed the Cambodians, who were oblivious to the events that had gutted the temple. The shift of artefacts to this temple was announced as permanent by Premier Zhou Enlai when the original owners wanted the artefacts to be returned.\nIn 1992, with the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; and Chinese donors, the Hall of the Thai Buddha was constructed slightly west of the old temple.\nIndia-China cultural cooperation.\nThe symbolic importance of the temple for the ancient cultural relations between China and India was demonstrated when the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20India\"&gt;Prime Minister of India&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"P.V.%20Narasimha%20Rao\"&gt;P.V. Narasimha Rao&lt;/a&gt; visited the temple in 1993. A decade later, in 2003, Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Atal%20Bihari%20Vajpayee\"&gt;Atal Bihari Vajpayee&lt;/a&gt; also visited the temple.\nTo enhance the Buddhist cultural links between India and China, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed on 11 April 2005. It stipulated that India would build an Indian-style Buddhist temple to the west side of the White Horse Temple, in the International Garden of the complex. Under this agreement, India was to provide the architectural design, material for construction, the Buddha statue, landscaping and technical advice from architects and experts during construction. Chinese authorities were to allot a piece of land of .\nFollowing the MOU, a Buddhist shrine that is a close replica of the &lt;a href=\"Sanchi\"&gt;Sanchi Stupa&lt;/a&gt; was completed in 2008. Its presence in the precincts of China's first temple was inspired by Buddhist saints from India. The architectural features of the new temple closely recreate those of Sanchi's Stupa, including Sanchi's east gate. An image of the Buddha was transported from India and consecrated in the new temple, in conformity with the Indian Buddhist tradition. It is worth noticing that this temple was built on land donated by the Chinese government. The shrine is a two-storied structure with circular walls on both floors. Its circular walls are embellished with murals of scenes from the &lt;a href=\"Jataka%20tales\"&gt;Jataka tales&lt;/a&gt; and the life of Buddha. The temple was executed in close co-ordination with the Indian design experts selected for the project, and Architects Akshaya Jain &amp; Kshitij Jain made several visits to the site in relation with their work as consultants.\nThe Buddha statue was designed following the pattern of the &lt;a href=\"Dharmachakra%20Pravartana%20Buddha%20at%20Sarnath\"&gt;5th-century image of the Buddha kept at Sarnath&lt;/a&gt;, and it has been consecrated in the temple's central congressional hall The &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20India\"&gt;President of India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pratibha%20Patil\"&gt;Pratibha Patil&lt;/a&gt;, inaugurated this temple on May 27, 2010. The new temple incorporates features from the most revered Indian Buddhist shrines of Sanchi and Sarnath.\nArchitecture.\nThe temple faces south and is aligned along a central axis starting from the entrance gate followed by several halls and courtyards in succession. The temple compound covers an area of 200 &lt;a href=\"mu%20%28area%29\"&gt;mu&lt;/a&gt; () and faces south. A stone &lt;a href=\"paifang\"&gt;paifang&lt;/a&gt; (archway), a three-door covered archway, has been recently built, in front of the original gate. The stone horses at the front of the temple are in the Ming architectural style, representing the white horses which carried the scriptures and the Indian monks to China. Between the archway and gate lies a pool with fountains, crossed by three stone bridges. The two horses at the entrance gate facing each other are made of green stone dated to the &lt;a href=\"Song%20dynasty\"&gt;Song dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (960\u20131279).\nEntering the temple today, plaques (in English and &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20language\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt;) and signposts are seen, which guide the visitors and pilgrims through the halls. The plaques briefly explain the statues in each hall. The halls are discerned in the inscriptions on the plaques, include the 'Hall of Greetings', 'Hall of Six Founders\u2019, 'Hall of jade Buddha', the 'Hall of Heavenly Kings', Hall of &lt;a href=\"Mahavira\"&gt;Mahavira&lt;/a&gt; and Hall of Changing Ge (repository of ancient scriptures).\nIn addition, the 'Cool and Clear Terrace' known as the 'Qingliang Terrace' is behind the main hall, the place where the original sutras were translated. This terrace is amidst bamboo forest of old pine trees and has halls which are interconnected. Four sides of the terrace are piled with green bricks. The central building of the terrace is the Vairocana Pavilion, which was originally constructed during the Han dynasty. The present building dates back to the Ming dynasty and was built with a \"xieshan\" style roof with double eaves. The pavilion principally enshrines statues of &lt;a href=\"Vairocana\"&gt;Vairocana&lt;/a&gt; Buddha and the Bodhisattvas &lt;a href=\"Manjushri\"&gt;Manjushri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Samantabhadra%20%28Bodhisattva%29\"&gt;Samantabhadra&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a total of 5,050 wood-carved Buddha statues, made with incense ash, are enshrined on both sides of the pavilion. The terrace also has the Kunlu Pavilion with halls on its east and west that house the statues of the two eminent monks, She Moteng and Zhu Falan. They were buried inside the temple gate after they died here; the Bell Tower and the Drum Tower, in front of their tombs, were once prominent sights of Luo Yang City.\nIn the courtyard, large burners are kept for worshipers to light incense sticks, creating a pungent odour. In the Main hall and other halls where images are worshiped, the altars are filled with fruit and other offerings made by the devotees. Multicoloured tapestry hang from the ceilings of the halls and lighted candles float in the basins, presenting a divine spiritual setting.\nThe smallest hall is known as the \u201cHall of greetings\u201d. It is a relatively new building that was built during the 9th year of Guangho period as replacement to the original hall which was burned down at the beginning of the Tonghzi period. This hall has deified statues of three western paradise (Indian) saints. &lt;a href=\"Amitabha\"&gt;Amitabha&lt;/a&gt;, the founder, is at the centre and is flanked by &lt;a href=\"Guanyin\"&gt;Guanyin&lt;/a&gt; on the left and &lt;a href=\"Mahasthamaprapta\"&gt;Mahasthamaprapta&lt;/a&gt; on the right.\nThe founders of the temple whose statues are worshiped in the \u2018Hall of Six Founders\u2019 belonged to the sect of &lt;a href=\"Chan%20Buddhism\"&gt;Chan&lt;/a&gt;. The names of the founders as displayed in the order of their succession: Bodidharma, the first founder who hailed from ancient India where he was the 28th generation patriarch preaching the Buddhist philosophy; the second was Huike; the third founder was Sengcan; the fourth was Daoxn, the fifth founder was Hongren; and the sixth was Huineng. Subsequent to Huineng, five schools of Buddhism and Seven Orders were established.\nIn the \"Hall of the Jade Buddha,\" stands an image of the &lt;a href=\"Sakyamuni%20Buddha\"&gt;Sakyamuni Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. The tall image made in &lt;a href=\"jade\"&gt;jade&lt;/a&gt; was donated in 1988 by a Chinese man who had settled in &lt;a href=\"Myanmar\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;. This elegantly sculpted and cherished statue has a precious stone embedded in its forehead. Before it was shifted to this temple in 1992, it had been stored in the Pilu pavilion.\nThe first large hall in the temple complex is known as \"The Hall of Heavenly Kings,\" where a statue of the &lt;a href=\"Budai\"&gt;Maitreya&lt;/a&gt;, known in China as the laughing Buddha, is the main deity located in the hall's front. This statue is flanked on the eastern and western sides by four heavenly kings, each representing one fourth of the universe. The eastern side is ruled by Chigua (guardian of the State) carrying a Pipa, the western side is controlled by Guangmu (Sharp-seer) with a dragon in his hand, the southern direction is represented by Zengzhang (Growth Protector), carrying an umbrella and the northern direction is represented by Duowen (Knowledge Preserver), carrying a &lt;a href=\"Pagoda\"&gt;Pagoda&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, there is a statue of &lt;a href=\"Skanda%20%28Buddhism%29\"&gt;Wei Tuo&lt;/a&gt; (a high ranking heavenly general and defender of Buddhist law) at the rear of the Maitreya statue.\nThe Hall of Changing Ge, built in 1995, is a repository of ancient scriptures, which has more than ten types of Buddhist texts, including the \"Longzang Jing Dazong Jing\", the \"Dazeng Zong Jing\", the \"Tibet Jing\" and so forth. An ancient Buddha statue of China is installed at the centre of the repository. The making of this Buddha statue is traced to the &lt;a href=\"Han%20dynasty\"&gt;Eastern Han dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The statue was misplaced at the early 20th century. However, it was later found in &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; and was replicated in bronze into two tall statues and then gilded. One of these is deified in the library and the other was sent to Thailand.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mahavira%20Hall\"&gt;Mahavira Hall&lt;/a&gt; enshrines the statues of three principal Buddhas. The central image is of the &lt;a href=\"Gautama%20Buddha\"&gt;Sakyamuni&lt;/a&gt; Buddha. This statue is flanked on the left by &lt;a href=\"Bhaisajyaguru\"&gt;Bhaisajyaguru&lt;/a&gt; and on the right by &lt;a href=\"Amit%C4%81bha\"&gt;Amitabha&lt;/a&gt;; these in turn are flanked by two heavenly generals named &lt;a href=\"Skanda%20%28Buddhism%29\"&gt;Wei Tuo&lt;/a&gt; and Wei Li. Statues of the &lt;a href=\"Eighteen%20Arhats\"&gt;Eighteen Arhats&lt;/a&gt; adorn the side of the hall. All the statues were made in ramie-cloth during the &lt;a href=\"Yuan%20dynasty\"&gt;Yuan dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The walls on both sides are adorned with carvings of ten thousand Buddhists. A statue of Jialan is installed facing north of the backdoor.\nIn the Main Hall, at the altar, there are three statues, the central statue is that of &lt;a href=\"Sakhyamuni%20Buddha\"&gt;Sakhyamuni Buddha&lt;/a&gt; flanked by statue of &lt;a href=\"Manjushri\"&gt;Manjushri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Samantabhadra%20%28Bodhisattva%29\"&gt;Samantabhadra&lt;/a&gt;. There is a very large bell weighing more than 1 tonne (a figure of 2.5 tonnes is also mentioned), installed during the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Jiajing%20Emperor\"&gt;Jiajing Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ming%20dynasty\"&gt;Ming dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, near the altar, which is struck in time during the chanting of prayers by the monks. A community of ten thousand monks resided here during the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20dynasty\"&gt;Tang dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The inscription on the bell reads: \"The sound of the Bell resounds in Buddha's temple causing the ghosts in Hell to tremble with fear.\"\nThe living quarters of the monks are in an exclusive pagoda, with restricted entry, called the \"Qiyun Ta,\" or Qiyun Pagoda. It is approachable after crossing the manicured garden and a bridge to the left of the main temple. This pagoda was built in the 12th century in the fifteenth year of the Dading reign of the &lt;a href=\"Jin%20dynasty%20%281115%E2%80%931234%29\"&gt;Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)&lt;/a&gt;.
