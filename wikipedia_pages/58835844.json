    "title": "2019 Los Angeles Dodgers season",
    "text": "The 2019 Los Angeles Dodgers season was the 130th season for the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;franchise&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;, and their 62nd season in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. They played their home games at &lt;a href=\"Dodger%20Stadium\"&gt;Dodger Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. On September 4, the Dodgers broke the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; record for most home runs in a season with 250th homer (breaking the old mark set by the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Houston%20Astros%20season\"&gt;2000 Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;). The Dodgers clinched their seventh straight &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20West\"&gt;National League West&lt;/a&gt; title on September 10, the earliest they had clinched in franchise history. They finished the regular season with a record of 106\u201356, breaking the franchise records for wins in a season previously held by the &lt;a href=\"1953%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;1953 Brooklyn Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;. Their 106-56 record was the second best in the MLB, just a spot behind the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt; who had a record of 107-55 which was the best record in all of &lt;a href=\"MLB\"&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"2019\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;. The Dodgers lost to the eventual world series champion &lt;a href=\"2019%20Washington%20Nationals%20season\"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20National%20League%20Division%20Series\"&gt;Division Series&lt;/a&gt; in five games, ending their streak of three straight NLCS appearances. With the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Nationals\"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt; winning the &lt;a href=\"2019%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;, the Los Angeles Dodgers become the second franchise to lose to the eventual World Series champions in four consecutive postseasons, (the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; from 2001 to 2004 were the first).\nOffseason.\nFront Office / Coaching staff.\nThird Base coach &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Woodward\"&gt;Chris Woodward&lt;/a&gt; left his position with the Dodgers after the 2018 season to become the &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Manager&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt; and shortly afterwards hitting coach &lt;a href=\"Turner%20Ward\"&gt;Turner Ward&lt;/a&gt; left the team to take on a similar position with the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt;. Assistant hitting coach &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Ortiz%20%28third%20baseman%29\"&gt;Luis Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; also left the team to take on a role as hitting coach for the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn November 6, &lt;a href=\"General%20Manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;General Manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Farhan%20Zaidi\"&gt;Farhan Zaidi&lt;/a&gt; left the Dodgers to become the President of Baseball Operations for the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn November 28, the Dodgers finalized their coaching staff. They named &lt;a href=\"Dino%20Ebel\"&gt;Dino Ebel&lt;/a&gt; as the new third base coach, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Van%20Scoyoc\"&gt;Robert Van Scoyoc&lt;/a&gt; as the hitting coach, &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Bates\"&gt;Aaron Bates&lt;/a&gt; as assistant hitting coach and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Gimenez\"&gt;Chris Gimenez&lt;/a&gt; as game planning coach. They also promoted &lt;a href=\"Brant%20Brown\"&gt;Brant Brown&lt;/a&gt; to the new position of hitting strategist. On December 3, they agreed to a four-year contract extension with manager &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Roberts%20%28outfielder%29\"&gt;Dave Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, running through the 2022 season.\nThe Dodgers announced in December that they would not be hiring a new General Manager during the off-season, though they did hire &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kingston%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Jeff Kingston&lt;/a&gt; to be Assistant General Manager.\nIn March they promoted &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Gomes\"&gt;Brandon Gomes&lt;/a&gt; to also be an assistant GM and Will Rhymes to Gomes old position as Director of Player Development.\nBroadcast team.\nOn December 17, 2018, the Dodgers announced that &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Neverett\"&gt;Tim Neverett&lt;/a&gt; would be joining the broadcast team. He would work select television and radio games in place of &lt;a href=\"Charley%20Steiner\"&gt;Charley Steiner&lt;/a&gt; who had chosen to scale back his work schedule. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Kennedy%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Kevin Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; would be leaving his part-time role with the team.\nRoster departures.\nOn October 29, 2018, the day after the Dodgers season ended with a World Series loss, seven players became free agents. They included pitchers &lt;a href=\"John%20Axford\"&gt;John Axford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Hudson\"&gt;Daniel Hudson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Madson\"&gt;Ryan Madson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hyun-jin%20Ryu\"&gt;Hyun-jin Ryu&lt;/a&gt;, catcher &lt;a href=\"Yasmani%20Grandal\"&gt;Yasmani Grandal&lt;/a&gt; and infielders &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Dozier\"&gt;Brian Dozier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manny%20Machado\"&gt;Manny Machado&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, second baseman &lt;a href=\"Chase%20Utley\"&gt;Chase Utley&lt;/a&gt;, who had one more year remaining on his contract, retired. Ryu accepted the Dodgers $17.9 million qualifying offer and remained with the team for 2019. On November 20, the Dodgers released RHP &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Koehler\"&gt;Tom Koehler&lt;/a&gt; and designated LHP &lt;a href=\"Zac%20Rosscup\"&gt;Zac Rosscup&lt;/a&gt;, RHP &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Goeddel\"&gt;Erik Goeddel&lt;/a&gt; and IF/OF &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Locastro\"&gt;Tim Locastro&lt;/a&gt; for assignment. Switch Pitcher &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Venditte\"&gt;Pat Venditte&lt;/a&gt; was designated for assignment on November 28.\nTrades.\nOn November 28, the Dodgers acquired left-handed pitcher &lt;a href=\"Adam%20McCreery\"&gt;Adam McCreery&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt; for cash. On December 21, 2018, the Dodgers traded outfielders &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Kemp\"&gt;Matt Kemp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yasiel%20Puig\"&gt;Yasiel Puig&lt;/a&gt;, left-handed pitcher &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Wood%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Alex Wood&lt;/a&gt;, catcher/infielder &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Farmer\"&gt;Kyle Farmer&lt;/a&gt; and cash considerations to the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for right-handed pitcher &lt;a href=\"Homer%20Bailey\"&gt;Homer Bailey&lt;/a&gt; and two minor leaguers, &lt;a href=\"Jeter%20Downs\"&gt;Jeter Downs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Josiah%20Gray\"&gt;Josiah Gray&lt;/a&gt;. They released Bailey the same day. On January 11, the Dodgers acquired catcher &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Martin\"&gt;Russell Martin&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Blue%20Jays\"&gt;Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for minor league prospects &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Sopko\"&gt;Andrew Sopko&lt;/a&gt; and Ronny Brito. The Blue Jays also sent cash to the Dodgers in the deal.\nSignings.\nOn November 1, 2018, the Dodgers bought out corner infielder &lt;a href=\"David%20Freese\"&gt;David Freese&lt;/a&gt;'s 2019 option for $500,000 and then re-signed him for one year and $4.5 million. The following day, they reached a deal with starting pitcher &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Kershaw\"&gt;Clayton Kershaw&lt;/a&gt;, in order to avoid him opting out of his previous deal they agreed to a three-year, $93 million contract. This agreement extends his previous contract by one year and $28 million. On December 21, the Dodgers announced that they had signed right-handed pitcher &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Kelly%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Joe Kelly&lt;/a&gt; to a three-year, $27 million contract, which included an option for a fourth year. On January 26, 2019, the Dodgers signed outfielder &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Pollock\"&gt;A. J. Pollock&lt;/a&gt; to a four-year, $55 million contract that included a player option for a fifth year.\nSpring Training.\nThe Dodgers began &lt;a href=\"spring%20training\"&gt;spring training&lt;/a&gt; on February 12, 2019, when pitchers and catchers reported to camp at &lt;a href=\"Camelback%20Ranch\"&gt;Camelback Ranch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glendale%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Glendale, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. On March 10, the Dodgers released right-handed relief pitcher &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Fields%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Josh Fields&lt;/a&gt; when they claimed left-handed pitcher &lt;a href=\"Donnie%20Hart\"&gt;Donnie Hart&lt;/a&gt; off waivers from the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Orioles\"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Kershaw\"&gt;Clayton Kershaw&lt;/a&gt; was expected to be the Dodgers opening day starter for a ninth straight season, but he experienced shoulder inflammation early in camp which kept him from pitching in spring training games and led to him beginning the season on the injured list. Near the end of spring training, &lt;a href=\"Rich%20Hill%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Rich Hill&lt;/a&gt; came down with a strained MCL, leading to the Dodgers announcing that &lt;a href=\"Hyun-jin%20Ryu\"&gt;Hyun-jin Ryu&lt;/a&gt; would start on opening day and that &lt;a href=\"Ross%20Stripling\"&gt;Ross Stripling&lt;/a&gt; would also begin the season in the rotation.\nRegular season.\nMarch.\nThe season began on March 28 with a home series against the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hyun-Jin%20Ryu\"&gt;Hyun-Jin Ryu&lt;/a&gt; made the &lt;a href=\"Opening%20Day\"&gt;Opening Day&lt;/a&gt; start and allowed only one run while striking out eight in six innings. Meanwhile, the Dodgers offense hit an MLB opening day record eight home runs, with two each by &lt;a href=\"Joc%20Pederson\"&gt;Joc Pederson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt;. The Dodgers began the season with a 12\u20135 victory. In the second game, &lt;a href=\"Ross%20Stripling\"&gt;Ross Stripling&lt;/a&gt; struck out five over five scoreless innings and &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Pollock\"&gt;A. J. Pollock&lt;/a&gt; had four hits, including a double and a homer, as the Dodgers jumped out to a 3\u20130 lead. However, reliever &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Kelly%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Joe Kelly&lt;/a&gt; allowed a three-run homer to &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Walker%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Christian Walker&lt;/a&gt; in the seventh and the game went into extra innings where the Diamondbacks won 5\u20134 thanks to a game-winning hit by &lt;a href=\"Carson%20Kelly\"&gt;Carson Kelly&lt;/a&gt; in the 13th inning. The Dodgers hit four more home runs in the third game of the season, including two by &lt;a href=\"Cody%20Bellinger\"&gt;Cody Bellinger&lt;/a&gt;, as they routed the Diamondbacks, 18\u20135. &lt;a href=\"Kenta%20Maeda\"&gt;Kenta Maeda&lt;/a&gt; in his debut, allowed three solo homers in 6 innings for the win. It was the first game in &lt;a href=\"Dodger%20Stadium\"&gt;Dodger Stadium&lt;/a&gt; where both lead-off hitters (Joc Pederson for the Dodgers and &lt;a href=\"Jarrod%20Dyson\"&gt;Jarrod Dyson&lt;/a&gt; for the Diamondbacks) hit home runs in their first at-bats. &lt;a href=\"Walker%20Buehler\"&gt;Walker Buehler&lt;/a&gt; struggled in his debut, allowing five runs on five hits without striking anyone out in only three innings on March 31, but a two-run double by Pollock in the eighth helped the Dodgers come from behind to win 8\u20137. The 43-run total was a club record for a four-game series.\nApril.\n&lt;a href=\"Julio%20Ur%C3%ADas\"&gt;Julio Ur\u00edas&lt;/a&gt; got the start on April 1 in the opener of a three-game series against the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt;. He struck out seven while allowing only three hits in five scoreless innings. However, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Kelly%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Joe Kelly&lt;/a&gt; allowed four runs on four hits in 1 innings and the Giants won 4\u20132. Ryu struck out five and allowed two runs in seven innings in the next game while &lt;a href=\"Cody%20Bellinger\"&gt;Cody Bellinger&lt;/a&gt; hit a grand slam home run and the Dodgers won 6\u20135. They hit at least one home run in each of their first six games, matching the franchise record set in &lt;a href=\"1954%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;1954&lt;/a&gt;. They broke that record when &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt; homered in the next game, and then a two-run double by &lt;a href=\"David%20Freese\"&gt;David Freese&lt;/a&gt; helped the Dodgers to a 5\u20133 comeback victory over the Giants to end the homestand.\nOn April 5, the Dodgers began their first road trip of the season with a trip to &lt;a href=\"Coors%20Field\"&gt;Coors Field&lt;/a&gt; to play the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt;. Bellinger hit a three-run homer in the Dodgers 10\u20136 win in the opener. He set Dodgers franchise records with six homers and 16 RBI through the first eight games of the season and became only the third player in MLB history to accomplish that, joining &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Mathews\"&gt;Eddie Mathews&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"1954%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1954&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Rodriguez\"&gt;Alex Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"2007%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Verdugo\"&gt;Alex Verdugo&lt;/a&gt; homered and tripled as the Dodgers took the next game, 7\u20132. Bellinger hit his seventh home run as the Dodgers finished off a sweep of the Rockies with a 12\u20136 win. The Dodgers scored 84 runs in their first 10 games, the third most in MLB history behind only the &lt;a href=\"1932%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;1932 Yankees&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"1999%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season\"&gt;1999 Indians&lt;/a&gt;. The Dodgers next traveled to &lt;a href=\"Busch%20Stadium\"&gt;Busch Stadium&lt;/a&gt; for a four-game series against the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;. They lost the opener 4\u20133 as their five-game winning streak and 10 game homer streak both came to an end. In the following game the team was hitless in nine at-bats with runners in scoring position, stranding 13 base runners in a 4\u20130 shutout loss. &lt;a href=\"Joc%20Pederson\"&gt;Joc Pederson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Max%20Muncy\"&gt;Max Muncy&lt;/a&gt; hit back-to-back home runs on April 10 but those were the only runs the Dodgers scored in a 7\u20132 loss to the Cardinals. The Cardinals finished off their first four-game sweep of the Dodgers since 2010 with an 11\u20137 win in the finale.\nThe Dodgers returned home on April 12 to face the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Brewers\"&gt;Milwaukee Brewers&lt;/a&gt;. Former Dodger &lt;a href=\"Yasmani%20Grandal\"&gt;Yasmani Grandal&lt;/a&gt; had three hits, including a two-run homer as the Brewers took game one, 8\u20135. &lt;a href=\"Zach%20Davies\"&gt;Zach Davies&lt;/a&gt; shut down the Dodgers in the next game, striking out six in seven innings as the Brewers won 4\u20131. The Dodgers six-game losing streak came to an end on April 14, when &lt;a href=\"Ross%20Stripling\"&gt;Ross Stripling&lt;/a&gt; allowed only one run on four hits in eight innings and they beat the Brewers 7\u20131. &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Kershaw\"&gt;Clayton Kershaw&lt;/a&gt; made his 2019 debut the following day in the opener of a three-game series against the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt;. He allowed two runs (on a two-run first inning homer by former Dodger &lt;a href=\"Yasiel%20Puig\"&gt;Yasiel Puig&lt;/a&gt;) in seven innings, and the Dodgers won 4\u20133 on a two-run walk-off homer by Joc Pederson. They won the next game too, 6\u20131, thanks to &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Verdugo\"&gt;Alex Verdugo&lt;/a&gt;, who had three hits and three RBI in the game. They finished off the sweep of the Reds with a 3\u20132 victory on April 17. A three-run home run by &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Pollock\"&gt;A. J. Pollock&lt;/a&gt; accounted for all the Dodgers scoring. They also tied an MLB record with the 32nd consecutive home game with a home run, matching the &lt;a href=\"1999%20Colorado%20Rockies%20season\"&gt;1999 Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dodgers next traveled to begin a series with the Brewers at &lt;a href=\"Miller%20Park\"&gt;Miller Park&lt;/a&gt;. Julio Ur\u00edas struck out nine in six scoreless innings while Cody Bellinger and Max Muncy homered in the 3\u20131 win in the series opener. Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez hit a three-run homer in the next game as the Dodgers came from behind to win 5\u20133. &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Yelich\"&gt;Christian Yelich&lt;/a&gt; hit two home runs in the next game as the Brewers snapped the Dodgers' six-game winning streak with a 5\u20130 shutout win. The Dodgers wrapped up the series with a 6\u20135 victory. Pederson hit two homers and Bellinger added a go-ahead homer in the ninth inning for the win. The Dodgers lost to the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt; in the opener of a three-game series at &lt;a href=\"Wrigley%20Field\"&gt;Wrigley Field&lt;/a&gt; on April 23, 7\u20132. A pair of three-run home runs, by &lt;a href=\"Javier%20B%C3%A1ez\"&gt;Javier B\u00e1ez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Heyward\"&gt;Jason Heyward&lt;/a&gt;, in the sixth inning gave the Cubs a 7\u20136 win over the Dodgers in the second game of the series. The Dodgers did take the last game of the series, 2\u20131.\nThe Dodgers returned home on April 26 to play the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; and won the opener, 6\u20132. &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Barnes\"&gt;Austin Barnes&lt;/a&gt; homered, doubled, and drove in three runs in the game while &lt;a href=\"Hyun-jin%20Ryu\"&gt;Hyun-jin Ryu&lt;/a&gt; struck out 10 in seven innings. Bellinger hit his 13th homer in the game to set a new MLB record with 88 total bases before the month of May. In the next game, Clayton Kershaw struck out eight in seven innings and picked up his first win of the season when Pederson's two-run triple in the seventh inning led the Dodgers to a 3\u20131 comeback victory. Despite the win, the Dodgers failed to homer in the game, snapping their 33-game home streak. &lt;a href=\"Rich%20Hill%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Rich Hill&lt;/a&gt; made his season debut on April 28, allowing five runs in six innings. Bellinger hit his 14th home run of the season and drove in three runs as the Dodgers came from behind to win, 7\u20136 to complete the sweep.\nThe Dodgers traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Park\"&gt;Oracle Park&lt;/a&gt; on April 29 to play the Giants and lost the opening game 3\u20132 thanks to a three-run double by &lt;a href=\"Evan%20Longoria\"&gt;Evan Longoria&lt;/a&gt; in the seventh inning. They finished off the month with a 10\u20133 win and became the first team in the majors to reach 20 wins.\nMay.\n&lt;a href=\"Madison%20Bumgarner\"&gt;Madison Bumgarner&lt;/a&gt; struck out six in eight innings while only allowing one run on four hits as the Giants beat the Dodgers 2\u20131 on May 1. The Dodgers won their next game, 4\u20133, over the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Padres\"&gt;San Diego Padres&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Petco%20Park\"&gt;Petco Park&lt;/a&gt;. A three-run home run by &lt;a href=\"Max%20Muncy\"&gt;Max Muncy&lt;/a&gt; led to a 5-run sixth inning as the Dodgers came from behind to win 7\u20136 the next day. &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20Renfroe\"&gt;Hunter Renfroe&lt;/a&gt; hit a pinch-hit grand slam off &lt;a href=\"Kenley%20Jansen\"&gt;Kenley Jansen&lt;/a&gt; to give the Padres an 8\u20135 win in the series finale.\nThe Dodgers returned home on May 6 and beat the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;, 5\u20133. &lt;a href=\"Walker%20Buehler\"&gt;Walker Buehler&lt;/a&gt; struck out eight in seven innings in the win. In the next game, &lt;a href=\"Hyun-jin%20Ryu\"&gt;Hyun-jin Ryu&lt;/a&gt; pitched a four hit, complete game, shutout and &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Turner\"&gt;Justin Turner&lt;/a&gt; hit three home runs and drove in six RBI in a 9\u20130 rout. The Dodgers hit three home runs in the following game, a 9\u20134 win, and finished off a three-game sweep of the Braves. They next split a four-game series with the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Nationals\"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt;. In the first game they were shutout 6\u20130 as &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Corbin\"&gt;Patrick Corbin&lt;/a&gt; struck out eight in seven innings. They returned the favor by shutting out the Nationals, 5\u20130, the next day. &lt;a href=\"Joc%20Pederson\"&gt;Joc Pederson&lt;/a&gt; hit two homers in the game. In the third game, Buehler struck out seven in seven scoreless innings but a grand slam homer by &lt;a href=\"Gerardo%20Parra\"&gt;Gerardo Parra&lt;/a&gt; off reliever &lt;a href=\"Dylan%20Floro\"&gt;Dylan Floro&lt;/a&gt; in the eighth led the Nationals to a 5\u20132 win. Ryu took a no-hitter into the eighth inning in the next game, while striking out nine and &lt;a href=\"Corey%20Seager\"&gt;Corey Seager&lt;/a&gt; hit a grand slam as the Dodgers won 6\u20130. The Dodgers beat the Padres 6\u20133 on May 14 as Pederson and &lt;a href=\"Cody%20Bellinger\"&gt;Cody Bellinger&lt;/a&gt; both homered. &lt;a href=\"Kenta%20Maeda\"&gt;Kenta Maeda&lt;/a&gt; struck out 12 batters in 6 scoreless innings while only allowing three hits and also singled in both of the Dodgers runs as they beat the Padres 2\u20130.\nThe Dodgers next began a three-game series against the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Great%20American%20Ballpark\"&gt;Great American Ballpark&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rich%20Hill%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Rich Hill&lt;/a&gt; became the oldest Dodgers pitcher since &lt;a href=\"Dazzy%20Vance\"&gt;Dazzy Vance&lt;/a&gt; to strike out 10 or more batters in game when he pitched six scoreless innings and the Dodgers hit four homers in a 6\u20130 win.

A grand slam home run by &lt;a href=\"David%20Freese\"&gt;David Freese&lt;/a&gt; in the first inning, helped power the Dodgers to a 10\u20132 rout of the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"PNC%20Park\"&gt;PNC Park&lt;/a&gt; on May 24.

The Dodgers then dropped a 2\u20131 game to the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Park\"&gt;Oracle Park&lt;/a&gt; on June 7.

They next traveled to &lt;a href=\"Angel%20Stadium\"&gt;Angel Stadium&lt;/a&gt; for a quick two-game series with the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels\"&gt;Los Angeles Angels&lt;/a&gt;. The Dodgers took the lead in the first game but the Angels tied it up with a two-run homer by &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Trout\"&gt;Mike Trout&lt;/a&gt; and then pulled ahead to win 5\u20133. The Angels also won by the same score in the following game thanks to a four-run first inning highlighted by a solo homer by &lt;a href=\"Shohei%20Ohtani\"&gt;Shohei Ohtani&lt;/a&gt; and a three-run homer by &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Bour\"&gt;Justin Bour&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter an off-day, the Dodgers returned home for a four-game series with the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;.

The Giants next came to town for another four-game series. The Dodgers were only able to score one run off Giants starter &lt;a href=\"Tyler%20Beede\"&gt;Tyler Beede&lt;/a&gt;, who picked up his first major league win as the Giants won 3\u20132 in the series opener. In the following game, &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Kershaw\"&gt;Clayton Kershaw&lt;/a&gt; pitched seven shutout innings while only allowing three hits and the Dodgers jumped on the Giants to win 9\u20130. &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt; hit a grand slam in the seventh inning. On June 19, the Dodgers became the first team in the majors to win 50 games thanks to a 9\u20132 win. &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Taylor%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Chris Taylor&lt;/a&gt; hit two homers, doubled, and drove in four runs.

The &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt; were the next team to visit &lt;a href=\"Dodger%20Stadium\"&gt;Dodger Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, for a three-game weekend series. Walker Buehler pitched his first career &lt;a href=\"complete%20game\"&gt;complete game&lt;/a&gt;, allowing only three hits and two runs (on two solo homers) while striking out a personal best 16 batters. The Dodgers won the game, 4\u20132, on a walk-off two-run home run by &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Beaty\"&gt;Matt Beaty&lt;/a&gt;. The Dodgers won the following day, 5\u20134, on another walk-off homer, this time by &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Verdugo\"&gt;Alex Verdugo&lt;/a&gt; in the 11th inning. The Dodgers made it three straight games with walk-off homers by rookies when Will Smith hit a three-run homer on June 23 to give the Dodgers a 6\u20133 win and a sweep of the Rockies.\nAfter the long home stand, the Dodgers went on the road on June 24, beginning with a series at Chase Field against the Diamondbacks. The game was tied at four heading into the bottom of the eighth, when the Diamondbacks scored four runs off of &lt;a href=\"Dylan%20Floro\"&gt;Dylan Floro&lt;/a&gt; to end the Dodgers winning streak, 8\u20135. The Dodgers picked up their 55th win the next day, with a 3\u20132 win, matching the best start in Los Angeles franchise history. In the final game of the series, the Dodgers started &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Gonsolin\"&gt;Tony Gonsolin&lt;/a&gt;, who was making his MLB debut. He allowed four runs in the first inning without recording an out and six total in his four innings of work as the Diamonbacks routed the Dodgers 8\u20132 for the series win. Next the Dodgers began a four-game series at &lt;a href=\"Coors%20Field\"&gt;Coors Field&lt;/a&gt; against the Rockies by winning a 12\u20138 contest. The Dodgers hit six home runs in the game, including two by &lt;a href=\"Max%20Muncy\"&gt;Max Muncy&lt;/a&gt;. However, in the next game, the Rockies erupted for eight runs in the fifth inning to beat the Dodgers, 13\u20139, for their first win against them in more than nine months. They beat them again the following day, 5\u20133, as &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Gray\"&gt;Jon Gray&lt;/a&gt; quieted the Dodgers bats. The bats came back alive in the next game, breaking out with a six-run sixth inning, to finish a series split with a 10\u20135 win.\nJuly.\nThe Dodgers returned home on July 2 for a quick two-game series with the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt;. The Dodgers trailed by a run and were down to their last out in the first game when Diamondbacks &lt;a href=\"closer%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;closer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Holland\"&gt;Greg Holland&lt;/a&gt; lost control and walked four straight batters to tie the game. &lt;a href=\"T.%20J.%20McFarland\"&gt;T. J. McFarland&lt;/a&gt; then came in and walked &lt;a href=\"Cody%20Bellinger\"&gt;Cody Bellinger&lt;/a&gt; to give the Dodgers a 5\u20134 win. It was the first time a major league game had ended on five straight walks and the first time in team history the Dodgers had won four straight home games on walk-offs. They picked up their fifth straight walk off win the next day when Bellinger homered in the 10th inning (his second homer of the game) to give the Dodgers another 5\u20134 win and complete the sweep. They became the first team since the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season\"&gt;2004 Oakland Athletics&lt;/a&gt; with five straight home walk offs and Bellinger set a new Dodgers franchise record with his 29th home run before the All-Star break. The Dodgers welcomed the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Padres\"&gt;San Diego Padres&lt;/a&gt; for a four-game series and took the series opener 5\u20131 behind home runs from &lt;a href=\"Max%20Muncy\"&gt;Max Muncy&lt;/a&gt; and Bellinger and six scoreless innings from &lt;a href=\"Hyun-Jin%20Ryu\"&gt;Hyun-Jin Ryu&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Kershaw\"&gt;Clayton Kershaw&lt;/a&gt; struck out nine in seven innings while only allowing two runs but the Padres beat the Dodgers, 3\u20132, on a solo homer by &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20Renfroe\"&gt;Hunter Renfroe&lt;/a&gt; in the eighth inning. The loss snapped a nine-game winning streak by the Dodgers at home The Padres won again the next night, as Renfroe and &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Margot\"&gt;Manuel Margot&lt;/a&gt; homered in their 3\u20131 win. &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Tat%C3%ADs%20Jr.\"&gt;Fernando Tat\u00eds Jr.&lt;/a&gt; homered twice in the next game as the Padres took the series with a 5\u20133 win. Despite the loss, the first time all season they had lost three straight at home, the Dodgers headed into the All-Star break with a 13 game lead in the division and the best record in baseball.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;2019 Major League Baseball All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joc%20Pederson\"&gt;Joc Pederson&lt;/a&gt; participated in the &lt;a href=\"Home%20Run%20Derby\"&gt;Home Run Derby&lt;/a&gt;, losing to &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Guerrero%20Jr.\"&gt;Vladimir Guerrero Jr.&lt;/a&gt; in a semi-final match that went to a swing-off tie-breaker. Kershaw, Ryu, Bellinger, Muncy and &lt;a href=\"Walker%20Buehler\"&gt;Walker Buehler&lt;/a&gt; represented the Dodgers in the All-Star Game.\nThe Dodgers opened the second half of the season at &lt;a href=\"Fenway%20Park\"&gt;Fenway Park&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"2018%20World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; rematch against the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29\"&gt;Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez&lt;/a&gt; struck out 10 batters while shutting down the Dodgers offense while a three-run homer by &lt;a href=\"Xander%20Bogaerts\"&gt;Xander Bogaerts&lt;/a&gt; ignited a five-run seventh inning that allowed the Red Sox to pull away for an 8\u20131 win. The Dodgers snapped their four-game losing streak the next game thanks to four home runs, including one by &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Pollock\"&gt;A. J. Pollock&lt;/a&gt; who rejoined the roster after having been on the injured list since April. The Dodgers won 11\u20132. The Dodgers took the final game of the series, 7\u20134, in 12 innings. The team next traveled to &lt;a href=\"Citizens%20Bank%20Park\"&gt;Citizens Bank Park&lt;/a&gt; to begin a four-game series with the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt;. They routed the Phillies 16\u20132 in the series opener behind four home runs, including two from Bellinger. Kershaw allowed one run in six innings, striking out seven batters in the game. The following game, the Phillies jumped out to an early 6\u20131 lead thanks to three homers and a pair of Dodgers errors but the Dodgers fought back thanks to five homers of their own to take the lead into the ninth only for the Phillies to score three runs off of &lt;a href=\"Kenley%20Jansen\"&gt;Kenley Jansen&lt;/a&gt; and beat the Dodgers, 9\u20138, on a walk-off double by &lt;a href=\"Bryce%20Harper\"&gt;Bryce Harper&lt;/a&gt;. In game three of the series, the Dodgers sat through a two-hour and 37-minute rain delay in the top of the third to win 7\u20132 behind two 2-run homers by &lt;a href=\"David%20Freese\"&gt;David Freese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Turner\"&gt;Justin Turner&lt;/a&gt;. In the final game of the series, &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt; hit two homers with four RBIs but the Dodgers bullpen allowed four runs in the seventh inning and the Phillies came from behind again to win 7\u20136 and split the series.\nAfter a 4\u20133 road trip, the Dodgers returned home to start a five-game homestand, beginning with a three-game series against the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Marlins\"&gt;Miami Marlins&lt;/a&gt;. Ryu allowed one run in seven innings, striking out seven batters, in the first game as the Dodgers won 2\u20131. In the next game, Kershaw allowed only two hits and one walk while striking out 10 in six scoreless innings as the Dodgers jumped out to a 6\u20131 lead. However, the bullpen again faltered, giving up five runs in the top of the eighth inning. The Dodgers rebounded with a three-run homer by &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Beaty\"&gt;Matt Beaty&lt;/a&gt; in the bottom of the inning and won the game, 10\u20136. The Dodgers routed the Marlins 9\u20130 to finish off a series sweep. Muncy, Pederson and Pollock homered and Buehler pitched seven scoreless innings, striking out eleven batters. The Dodgers finished up the homestand by being swept in a quick two-game series by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Angels\"&gt;Los Angeles Angels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Trout\"&gt;Mike Trout&lt;/a&gt; homered and threw out Max Muncy at the plate in the Angels 5\u20134 win in the first game while &lt;a href=\"Kole%20Calhoun\"&gt;Kole Calhoun&lt;/a&gt; homered and doubled twice in the Angels 3\u20132 win in the second game. By winning all four games between the two teams on the season, the Angels swept the &lt;a href=\"Freeway%20Series\"&gt;Freeway Series&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since &lt;a href=\"Interleague%20play\"&gt;Interleague play&lt;/a&gt; began in &lt;a href=\"1997%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 26, the Dodgers began a three-game weekend series against the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Nationals\"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Nationals%20Park\"&gt;Nationals Park&lt;/a&gt;. They won the series opener 4\u20132 on a go-ahead three-run homer by Justin Turner. Ryu allowed one run on 6 innings, striking out four. The Dodgers won the next game, 9\u20133. &lt;a href=\"Will%20Smith%20%28catcher%29\"&gt;Will Smith&lt;/a&gt; had three hits, a home run and two doubles, and drove in six RBI, the most RBI in a game by a Dodger rookie since &lt;a href=\"James%20Loney\"&gt;James Loney&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2006%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. The Nationals broke out in the series finale to win \n11\u20134, thanks partly to some sloppy defense by the Dodgers. That trend would continue at &lt;a href=\"Coors%20Field\"&gt;Coors Field&lt;/a&gt; in the series opener against the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt; with the Dodgers losing 9\u20131. They bounced back to win the second game of the series 9\u20134 behind home runs from Pollock, Turner, &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Martin\"&gt;Russell Martin&lt;/a&gt; and newly acquired &lt;a href=\"Kristopher%20Negr%C3%B3n\"&gt;Kristopher Negr\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Gonsolin\"&gt;Tony Gonsolin&lt;/a&gt; recorded a four inning save in his second major league game. In the series finale, Ryu pitched six scoreless innings, striking out one batter and giving up three hits.

In the series opener, &lt;a href=\"Will%20Smith%20%28catcher%29\"&gt;Will Smith&lt;/a&gt; hit a go-ahead grand slam in the sixth inning and they cruised to an 8\u20132 victory. The Dodgers top pitching prospect, &lt;a href=\"Dustin%20May\"&gt;Dustin May&lt;/a&gt;, made his debut in the next game. He pitched well until running out of steam in the sixth inning and surrendering the lead. Overall he pitched 5 innings, allowing four runs (three earned) on nine hits with three strikeouts as the Dodgers lost the game 5\u20132. In the next game, &lt;a href=\"Walker%20Buehler\"&gt;Walker Buehler&lt;/a&gt; pitched a complete game, allowing only a home run by &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Margot\"&gt;Manuel Margot&lt;/a&gt; while striking out 15 batters as the Dodgers won 4\u20131. Buehler became only the third pitcher in MLB history with multiple starts of at least 15 strikeouts and no walks in the same season. In the series finale, &lt;a href=\"Max%20Muncy\"&gt;Max Muncy&lt;/a&gt; hit a walk-off double for the Dodgers 11\u201310 win.\nThe Dodgers continued their homestand with a three-game series with the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;. In the series opener, the Dodgers routed the Cardinals 8\u20130 behind six scoreless innings from &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Gonsolin\"&gt;Tony Gonsolin&lt;/a&gt;, who got his first major league win, as well as home runs from &lt;a href=\"Cody%20Bellinger\"&gt;Cody Bellinger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joc%20Pederson\"&gt;Joc Pederson&lt;/a&gt;. In the second game of the series, the Dodgers edged the Cardinals 3\u20131 behind &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Kershaw\"&gt;Clayton Kershaw&lt;/a&gt;, who pitched seven innings, allowing one run and one walk while striking out nine batters. In the series finale, May struck out seven in 5 innings while only allowing one run, but the Cardinals starter &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Flaherty%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Jack Flaherty&lt;/a&gt; only gave up four hits while striking out 10 in seven scoreless innings. The Dodgers came from behind to win 2\u20131 on a walk-off two-run single by &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Martin\"&gt;Russell Martin&lt;/a&gt;. After an off-day, the Dodgers took on the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Diamondbacks\"&gt;Arizona Diamondbacks&lt;/a&gt; for three games. Buehler shut them out for six innings with eight strikeouts and the Dodgers had a 2\u20130 lead going into the ninth when &lt;a href=\"Carson%20Kelly\"&gt;Carson Kelly&lt;/a&gt; hit a two-run homer off &lt;a href=\"Kenley%20Jansen\"&gt;Kenley Jansen&lt;/a&gt; to tie the game.

The Dodgers recorded 13 extra base hits in the opener (matching a franchise record set on September 18, &lt;a href=\"2006%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;), including two homers by Will Smith and three doubles by &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Pollock\"&gt;A. J. Pollock&lt;/a&gt;, as they rolled to a 15\u20131 victory. Dustin May recorded his first major league win. In the following game, Kershaw allowed only two hits in seven shutout innings, with 10 strikeouts as the Dodgers won 9\u20131, with Kershaw tying &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Koufax\"&gt;Sandy Koufax&lt;/a&gt; for most career wins by a Dodger left-handed pitcher (165). &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20R%C3%ADos\"&gt;Edwin R\u00edos&lt;/a&gt; hit his first two major-league home runs in the game.

The team headed to &lt;a href=\"SunTrust%20Park\"&gt;SunTrust Park&lt;/a&gt; for a three-game series against the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;.

A go-ahead grand slam by &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Ortega%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Rafael Ortega&lt;/a&gt; in the sixth inning off May gave the Braves another come-from-behind win, 5\u20133.\nThe Dodgers returned home on August 20 for a three-game &lt;a href=\"interleague%20play\"&gt;interleague&lt;/a&gt; series with the &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Blue%20Jays\"&gt;Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/a&gt;.

Walker Buehler threw seven scoreless innings, striking eight batters and giving up five hits. In the series finale, the Dodgers rallied from a two-run deficit in the 9th inning to sweep the Blue Jays 3\u20132 on &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt;'s walk-off single. The Dodgers next welcomed the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; to town for &lt;a href=\"Players%20Weekend\"&gt;Players Weekend&lt;/a&gt;, a matchup of the two teams with the best records in baseball. In the series opener, the Yankees dismantled the Dodgers 10\u20132 behind five home runs, including two by &lt;a href=\"Didi%20Gregorius\"&gt;Didi Gregorius&lt;/a&gt;. Ryu was charged with seven runs in 4 innings, his worst start of the season.

Kershaw pitched a season low five innings, giving up five earned runs, including a go-ahead two-run double by &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Ahmed\"&gt;Nick Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;, making it the first time he didn't complete at least six innings all season.\nSeptember.\nThe Dodgers avoided being swept by the Diamondbacks with a 4\u20133 win in 11 innings to start off September behind four solo home runs, including a game-tying homer by &lt;a href=\"Cody%20Bellinger\"&gt;Cody Bellinger&lt;/a&gt; in the ninth inning and a go-ahead homer by &lt;a href=\"Joc%20Pederson\"&gt;Joc Pederson&lt;/a&gt; in the 11th inning. The Dodgers broke the team record for home runs in a season, which had just been set the previous season.\nThe Dodgers returned home on September 2 to play the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20Rockies\"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt; for a three-game series. They began by routing the Rockies 16\u20139 behind seven home runs, including two each by Pederson and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Taylor%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Chris Taylor&lt;/a&gt;. Top prospect &lt;a href=\"Gavin%20Lux\"&gt;Gavin Lux&lt;/a&gt; was called up to make his major league debut at second base, and had two hits in five at-bats with a double and three runs scored. In the second game, the Dodgers edged the Rockies 5\u20133 behind a go-ahead three-run home run by &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Martin\"&gt;Russell Martin&lt;/a&gt; in the 7th inning. Pederson hit two more home runs, drive in three runs, and scored three runs in the series finale as the Dodgers swept the Rockies 7\u20133. They broke the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; record for most home runs in a season with their 250th homer (breaking the old mark set by the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Houston%20Astros%20season\"&gt;2000 Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Pollock\"&gt;A. J. Pollock&lt;/a&gt; hit three home runs in the opening game of a three-game series against the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Dodgers lost 5\u20134 as &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Kershaw\"&gt;Clayton Kershaw&lt;/a&gt; failed to get out of the fifth inning for the first time all season. In the next game, the Giants held the Dodgers offense to only four singles and shut them out 1\u20130. This was the first time the Dodgers had been shutout since May and only the fourth time all season. The Dodgers wrapped up the home stand with a 5\u20130 shutout of the Giants on September 8, to avoid the sweep. A two-run homer by &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Beaty\"&gt;Matt Beaty&lt;/a&gt; and a three-run homer by &lt;a href=\"Corey%20Seager\"&gt;Corey Seager&lt;/a&gt; accounted for all of the Dodgers runs.\nThe Dodgers next embarked on a six-game road trip, beginning with a three-game &lt;a href=\"Interleague%20play\"&gt;interleague series&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Orioles\"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;. In the series opener, Seager hit two home runs and drove in five runs while &lt;a href=\"Walker%20Buehler\"&gt;Walker Buehler&lt;/a&gt; pitched seven scoreless innings with eleven strikeouts (giving him a career high 200 on the season) as they defeated the Orioles 7\u20133. With the victory, the Dodgers clinched their seventh straight &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20West\"&gt;National League West&lt;/a&gt; division title in their 146th game, the earliest in franchise history. The Dodgers lost the next game, 7\u20133, with the big blow being a three-run home-run by &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Villar\"&gt;Jonathan Villar&lt;/a&gt;. That homer was the 6,106th of 2019, a new single-season record. In the series finale, the Dodgers scored three runs in the sixth inning, including the two go-ahead runs on a strikeout passed ball by &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Severino\"&gt;Pedro Severino&lt;/a&gt;, to edge the Orioles 4\u20132. The Dodgers next travel to New York to play the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Mets\"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; for three games. In the opener, Lux and &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20R%C3%ADos\"&gt;Edwin R\u00edos&lt;/a&gt; hit home runs to help the Dodgers rout the Mets 9\u20132. The next game was a scoreless duel through seven innings between &lt;a href=\"Hyun-jin%20Ryu\"&gt;Hyun-jin Ryu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20deGrom\"&gt;Jacob deGrom&lt;/a&gt;. The Mets then loaded in the bases in the eighth off of two hit batters and a walk before &lt;a href=\"Rajai%20Davis\"&gt;Rajai Davis&lt;/a&gt; hit a pinch hit three-run double to give the Mets the 3\u20130 victory. The Dodgers finished the road trip with a 3\u20132 victory over the Mets. An RBI single by &lt;a href=\"Jedd%20Gyorko\"&gt;Jedd Gyorko&lt;/a&gt; in the ninth inning accounted for the winning run.\nThe Dodgers returned home on September 17 to begin their final homestand of the regular season, starting with a brief two game interleague series with the &lt;a href=\"Tampa%20Bay%20Rays\"&gt;Tampa Bay Rays&lt;/a&gt;. They scored five runs in the seventh inning to defeat the Rays 7\u20135. Corey Seager drove in four runs in the game, with two doubles. The Rays took the second game, 8\u20137, in eleven innings after &lt;a href=\"Kenley%20Jansen\"&gt;Kenley Jansen&lt;/a&gt; allowed his career worst eighth blown save. The Dodgers defeated the Rockies 12\u20135 in their next game. They scored seven-runs in the 4th inning which included a three-run homer by A.J. Pollock. They set a new team single-season record for runs scored with 844. The Dodgers lost the next game to the Rockies, 4\u20132 with &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20McMahon%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Ryan McMahon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Fuentes\"&gt;Josh Fuentes&lt;/a&gt; hitting home runs. In the final home game of the season, the Dodgers hit four home runs to defeat the Rockies, 7\u20134, for their 100th win of the season.

A grand slam by &lt;a href=\"Max%20Muncy\"&gt;Max Muncy&lt;/a&gt; and a solo home run by Joc Pederson led them to a 6\u20133 win in the series opener, which clinched the best record in the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt;. In the next game, the Dodgers hit four more home runs, including a go-ahead one by Edwin R\u00edos in the seventh inning, to edge the Padres in a 6\u20134 win.

The Dodgers traveled to San Francisco to conclude the regular season with a three-game series against the Giants. They scored five runs on three home runs in the second inning as they routed the Giants, 9\u20132, to begin the series. In the following game, Ryu struck out seven in seven scoreless innings (clinching the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20annual%20ERA%20leaders\"&gt;2019 National League E.R.A. title&lt;/a&gt; with 2.32) and also drove in a run as the Dodgers won 2\u20130 to tie their franchise record for wins with 105 (previously set by the &lt;a href=\"1953%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;1953 Brooklyn Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;). The Dodgers broke that record with their 9\u20130 win over the Giants in the regular season finale.\nPostseason.\nNational League Division Series.\nThe Dodgers, with the best record in the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; during the regular season, began the postseason by hosting the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Washington%20Nationals%20season\"&gt;Washington Nationals&lt;/a&gt; in the Division Series. &lt;a href=\"Walker%20Buehler\"&gt;Walker Buehler&lt;/a&gt; struck out eight while allowing only one hit and three walks in six scoreless innings in the first game, while the Dodgers got home runs from &lt;a href=\"Gavin%20Lux\"&gt;Gavin Lux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joc%20Pederson\"&gt;Joc Pederson&lt;/a&gt; and three RBI by &lt;a href=\"Max%20Muncy\"&gt;Max Muncy&lt;/a&gt; to win 6\u20130. Game 2 saw &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Kershaw\"&gt;Clayton Kershaw&lt;/a&gt; start for the Dodgers against &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Strasburg\"&gt;Stephen Strasburg&lt;/a&gt;. The Nationals jumped out to an early lead with an RBI single in the first, then added two more in the second. Kershaw pitched six innings, allowed three runs on six hits, two hit batters, and one walk with four strikeouts. The Dodgers finally scored on a sacrifice fly by in the sixth. Strasburg struck out 10 in six innings allowing only one run on three hits and the Nationals evened up the series with the 4\u20132 win. &lt;a href=\"Hyun-jin%20Ryu\"&gt;Hyun-jin Ryu&lt;/a&gt; started game 3 and allowed only a two-run homer by &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Soto\"&gt;Juan Soto&lt;/a&gt; in five innings.

The Nationals won 6\u20131 to even the series up at two games and force a deciding game five. In the final game of the series, Buehler started and allowed only one run in 6 innings while the Dodgers got a two-run homer by Muncy and a solo homer by &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt; to take a 3\u20130 lead after two innings. However, the Nationals got back to back homers by Rendon and Soto in the eighth inning off Kershaw to tie the score.
