    "text": "Nino Martini (7 August 1902 \u2014 9 December 1976) was an Italian &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic &lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt; and actor. He began his career as an opera singer in Italy before moving to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to pursue an acting career in &lt;a href=\"film\"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;s. He appeared in several &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; movies during the 1930s and 1940s while simultaneously working as a leading tenor at the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.\nMartini possessed a warm &lt;a href=\"lyric%20tenor\"&gt;lyric tenor&lt;/a&gt; voice that had a wide range and considerable amount of &lt;a href=\"coloratura\"&gt;coloratura&lt;/a&gt; facility. He sang mostly within the Italian repertoire that encompassed the &lt;a href=\"bel%20canto\"&gt;bel canto&lt;/a&gt; literature of &lt;a href=\"Rossini\"&gt;Rossini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Donizetti\"&gt;Donizetti&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Bellini\"&gt;Bellini&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"grand%20opera\"&gt;grand opera&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Verdi\"&gt;Giuseppe Verdi&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"verismo\"&gt;verismo&lt;/a&gt; operas of &lt;a href=\"Giacomo%20Puccini\"&gt;Giacomo Puccini&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nMartini studied singing under &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Zenatello\"&gt;Giovanni Zenatello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Gay\"&gt;Maria Gay&lt;/a&gt; who were married and both well known opera singers. In 1925 he made his professional &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; debut in Milan as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's \"&lt;a href=\"Rigoletto\"&gt;Rigoletto&lt;/a&gt;\". Shortly thereafter he toured Europe as a concert artist appearing in many of the continent's major music centers. While in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; he was discovered by the film producer &lt;a href=\"Jesse%20Louis%20Lasky\"&gt;Jesse Louis Lasky&lt;/a&gt; who engaged him for several &lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian language&lt;/a&gt; speaking roles in short films.\nIn 1929, under the influence of Lasky, Martini immigrated to the United States to pursue a film career. His first appearance was in the &lt;a href=\"Paramount%20Pictures\"&gt;Paramount Pictures&lt;/a&gt; all-star revue film \"&lt;a href=\"Paramount%20on%20Parade\"&gt;Paramount on Parade&lt;/a&gt;\" (1930), in which he sang the song \"Come Back to Sorrento\" in one of the film's &lt;a href=\"Technicolor\"&gt;Technicolor&lt;/a&gt; sequences. This film has been restored by the &lt;a href=\"UCLA%20Film%20and%20Television%20Archive\"&gt;UCLA Film and Television Archive&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther forays into film were postponed, however, as Martini decided to continue to pursue an opera career. He made his U.S. opera debut in 1931 in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. This was followed by several broadcasts of opera for &lt;a href=\"radio\"&gt;radio&lt;/a&gt;. In 1933 Martini joined the roster at the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt;, making his debut on December 28 as the Duke of Mantua. He appeared in several more productions at the Met over the next thirteen years, singing the roles of Alfredo in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Traviata\"&gt;La Traviata&lt;/a&gt;\", Carlo in \"&lt;a href=\"Linda%20di%20Chamounix\"&gt;Linda di Chamounix&lt;/a&gt;\", Edgardo in \"&lt;a href=\"Lucia%20di%20Lammermoor\"&gt;Lucia di Lammermoor&lt;/a&gt;\", Ernesto in \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Pasquale\"&gt;Don Pasquale&lt;/a&gt;\", Rinuccio in \"&lt;a href=\"Gianni%20Schicchi\"&gt;Gianni Schicchi&lt;/a&gt;\", Rodolfo in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Boh%C3%A8me\"&gt;La Boh\u00e8me&lt;/a&gt;\", and Ruggero in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Rondine\"&gt;La Rondine&lt;/a&gt;\". His last performance at the Met was as Count Almaviva in \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20Barbiere%20di%20Siviglia\"&gt;Il Barbiere di Siviglia&lt;/a&gt;\" on April 20, 1946.\nWhile performing at the Met, Martini occasionally returned to Hollywood to appear in films, mostly appearing in pictures produced by Lasky. His film credits include \"Here's to Romance\" (1935), \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20for%20Madame\"&gt;Music for Madame&lt;/a&gt;\" (1937), and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gay%20Desperado\"&gt;The Gay Desperado&lt;/a&gt;\" (1936). The latter film featured &lt;a href=\"Ida%20Lupino\"&gt;Ida Lupino&lt;/a&gt; as his co-star, was directed by &lt;a href=\"Rouben%20Mamoulian\"&gt;Rouben Mamoulian&lt;/a&gt;, produced by Jesse Lasky and &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Pickford\"&gt;Mary Pickford&lt;/a&gt;, and released by &lt;a href=\"United%20Artists\"&gt;United Artists&lt;/a&gt;. His last film appearance was in \"&lt;a href=\"One%20Night%20with%20You%20%281948%20film%29\"&gt;One Night With You&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1948.\nIn 1945 Martini portrayed Rodolfo to &lt;a href=\"Grace%20Moore\"&gt;Grace Moore&lt;/a&gt;'s Mimi for the inaugural performance of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20Grand%20Opera%20Festival\"&gt;San Antonio Grand Opera Festival&lt;/a&gt;. In the late 1940s and 1950s Martini continued to perform as a singer mostly on the radio. He eventually returned to Italy where he lived in Verona until his death in 1976.\nRecordings.\nMartini made a few recordings of opera arias for &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Records\"&gt;Columbia Records&lt;/a&gt; who also produced the &lt;a href=\"soundtrack\"&gt;soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;s to several of the films that he appeared in. He also recorded some music with &lt;a href=\"RCA%20Victor\"&gt;RCA Victor&lt;/a&gt; and recorded the entire role of Ernesto in \"Don Paquale\" with the Metropolitan Opera in 1940 opposie &lt;a href=\"Bidu%20Say%C3%A3o\"&gt;Bidu Say\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt; in the title role."
