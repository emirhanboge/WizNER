    "text": "The Lyth Valley is on the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District%20National%20Park\"&gt;Lake District National Park&lt;/a&gt; in Cumbria, England.\nIt gives its name to an &lt;a href=\"Wards%20and%20electoral%20divisions%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;electoral ward&lt;/a&gt; (one of 45 in &lt;a href=\"South%20Lakeland\"&gt;South Lakeland&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe valley is sheltered by limestone hills and enjoys a relatively mild micro-climate for northern England. It is noted for its &lt;a href=\"damson\"&gt;damson&lt;/a&gt; orchards.\nDrainage.\nThe flat bottom of the valley was originally bog, but it has been drained for the benefit of farmers. In recent years there has been controversy about the cost of the pumps which keep the valley drained. For some years the pumping has been funded by the &lt;a href=\"Environment%20Agency\"&gt;Environment Agency&lt;/a&gt;, but the Agency decided that there were more significant problems in the area. The creation of an &lt;a href=\"Internal%20drainage%20board\"&gt;Internal drainage board&lt;/a&gt; has been discussed as an alternative. The Agency committed itself to keeping the pumping stations in operation until 2020 to allow more time for a decision on how water level management would to be organised in future. \nEcological implications.\nThere have been objections from environmentalists to a drainage regime which does not take account of the valley's contribution to biodiversity. It is argued that a less intensive drainage scheme would benefit wildlife, and still allow farming or &lt;a href=\"paludiculture\"&gt;paludiculture&lt;/a&gt;."
