    "text": "USS \"Flier\" (SS-250) was a &lt;a href=\"Gato%20class%20submarine\"&gt;\"Gato\"-class submarine&lt;/a&gt;, was the only ship of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; to be named for the &lt;a href=\"flier%20%28fish%29\"&gt;flier&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer &lt;a href=\"Keel%20laying\"&gt;keel was laid down&lt;/a&gt; 30 October 1942 by &lt;a href=\"Electric%20Boat%20Company\"&gt;Electric Boat Company&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Groton%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Groton, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;. She was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20naming%20and%20launching%23United%20States\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 11 July 1943 (&lt;a href=\"Sponsor%20%28military%2C%20naval%20ship%20naming%29\"&gt;sponsored&lt;/a&gt; by Mrs. A.\u00a0S. Pierce), and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning%23United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 18 October 1943 with &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Commander%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Lieutenant Commander&lt;/a&gt; John D. Crowley in command.\nFirst war patrol.\n\"Flier\" reached &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"New%20London%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;New London, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, on 20 December 1943, and prepared for her first war patrol, sailing 12 January 1944. However, the submarine ran aground near &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt; on 16 January. , a &lt;a href=\"submarine%20rescue%20ship\"&gt;submarine rescue ship&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to pull \"Flier\" free but ran aground herself and sank. \"Flier\" was eventually saved by and towed to first Pearl Harbor and then the &lt;a href=\"Mare%20Island%20Navy%20Yard\"&gt;Mare Island Navy Yard&lt;/a&gt; for repairs. On 21 May she sailed again for action, heading for a patrol area west of Luzon. She made her first contact on 4 June, attacking a well-escorted &lt;a href=\"convoy\"&gt;convoy&lt;/a&gt; of five &lt;a href=\"cargo%20ship\"&gt;merchantmen&lt;/a&gt;. Firing three &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es at each of two ships, she sent the &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport&lt;/a&gt; \"Hakusan Maru\" 10,380 tons to the bottom and scored a hit on another ship, before clearing the area to evade countermeasures.\nOn 13 June 1944, \"Flier\" attacked a convoy of 11 ships, cargo carriers and &lt;a href=\"tanker%20%28ship%29\"&gt;tanker&lt;/a&gt;s, guarded by at least six escorts. The alert behavior of the escorts during the attack resulted in a severe counterattack on \"Flier\" before she could observe what damage she had done to the convoy. On 22 June, she began a long chase after another large convoy, scoring four hits for six torpedoes fired at two cargo ships that day, and three hits for four torpedoes launched against another cargo ship of the same convoy the next day.\nSecond war patrol.\n\"Flier\" put into &lt;a href=\"Fremantle%20submarine%20base\"&gt;Fremantle submarine base&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, to refit between 5 July and 2 August 1944, then sailed on her second war patrol, bound for the coast of &lt;a href=\"Indochina\"&gt;Indochina&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Lombok%20Strait\"&gt;Lombok Strait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Macassar%20Strait\"&gt;Macassar Strait&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balabac%20Strait\"&gt;Balabac Strait&lt;/a&gt;. At about 2200 on 12 August, while transiting &lt;a href=\"Balabac%20Strait\"&gt;Balabac Strait&lt;/a&gt; on the surface, she struck a &lt;a href=\"naval%20mine\"&gt;naval mine&lt;/a&gt;. She sank in about a minute, but 15 officers and men were able to clamber out. Eight of them reached the beach of Byan Island after 17 hours in the water. Philippine guerrillas guided them to a &lt;a href=\"Coastwatchers\"&gt;coastwatcher&lt;/a&gt;, who arranged for them to be picked up by submarine, and on the night of 30\u201331 August, they were taken on board by .\n\"Flier\" received one &lt;a href=\"battle%20star\"&gt;battle star&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; service on her single war patrol, designated \"successful.\" She is credited with having sunk 10,380\u00a0tons of Japanese shipping.

The discovery of a \"Gato\"-class submarine was made during an expedition by YAP Films, based in part on information provided by a survivor of the sinking of \"Flier\". Further research by the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20History%20and%20Heritage%20Command\"&gt;Naval History and Heritage Command&lt;/a&gt; revealed that no other submarine, American or Japanese, had been reported lost in that general vicinity. In addition, footage of the wreck showed a gun mount and radar antenna, both of which were similar to the same equipment seen in contemporary photographs of \"Flier\". The ship rests in of water."
