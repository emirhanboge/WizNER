    "text": "The Palace of Rokan Hulu (known in Indonesian as Istana Rokan Hulu) is located in the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20regencies%20and%20cities%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;regency&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rokan%20Hulu\"&gt;Rokan Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riau\"&gt;Riau&lt;/a&gt; province, &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe wooden palace is approximately two hundred years old and was constructed by the Rokan Hulu kingdom, a small kingdom of the &lt;a href=\"Malays%20%28ethnic%20group%29\"&gt;Malayu&lt;/a&gt; people. It was the residence of the &lt;a href=\"sultan\"&gt;sultan&lt;/a&gt; and his family.\nThe building is notable not only as a relic of this lost kingdom but also due to its architecture. The palace features some outstanding examples of traditional wood-carving. It follows the traditional design of an old, Malayu 'rumah tinggi' house, with a soaring roof and a projecting porch. The palace is now protected as a &lt;a href=\"National%20Monument%20%28Indonesia%29\"&gt;national monument&lt;/a&gt;."
