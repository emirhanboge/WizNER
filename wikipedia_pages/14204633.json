He played &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20State%20University\"&gt;Iowa State University&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly years.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Springfield%20Southeast%20High%20School\"&gt;Feitshans High School&lt;/a&gt; he was an All-state selection in both &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;. He went on to play &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20State%20University\"&gt;Iowa State University&lt;/a&gt;, before focusing on &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; after his sophomore season and proceeding to lead the team in receiving for 3 consecutive years. He began as a &lt;a href=\"defensive%20back\"&gt;defensive back&lt;/a&gt; before being switched to &lt;a href=\"wide%20receiver\"&gt;wide receiver&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a senior in 1970, he had the most prolific receiving season in school history up to that point, breaking single-season school records in receptions (59), receiving yards (822) and &lt;a href=\"touchdown\"&gt;touchdown&lt;/a&gt;s (6). He also led the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Eight%20Conference\"&gt;Big Eight&lt;/a&gt; in all three categories and ranked 13th nationally in receiving, earning first-team all-&lt;a href=\"Big%20Eight%20Conference\"&gt;Big Eight&lt;/a&gt; honors. His 59 catches ranks fifth all-time and his 822 receiving yards seventh all-time in school history for a season. He finished his career as &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20State%20University\"&gt;Iowa State University&lt;/a&gt; all-time leader in receptions (132) and receiving yards (1,751), and second in career &lt;a href=\"touchdown\"&gt;touchdown&lt;/a&gt;s (10). He still ranks third in career receptions and fifth in receiving yards.\nIn 2008, he was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20State%20University\"&gt;Iowa State University&lt;/a&gt; Athletics Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career.\nMiami Dolphins.\nStowe was selected by the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Dolphins\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; in the second round (47th overall) of the &lt;a href=\"1971%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1971 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;. As a rookie, he was the backup to &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Warfield\"&gt;Paul Warfield&lt;/a&gt;, catching 5 passes for 68 yards and 1 &lt;a href=\"touchdown\"&gt;touchdown&lt;/a&gt;. He again saw limited action in his second season, with 13 receptions, 276 yards and 2 &lt;a href=\"touchdown\"&gt;touchdown&lt;/a&gt;s). Six of the receptions for 140 yards and both touchdowns came in a single \"&lt;a href=\"Monday%20Night%20Football\"&gt;Monday Night Football&lt;/a&gt;\" game against the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; while replacing an injured Warfield. Despite winning a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, he requested to be traded after the season.\nOn May 10, &lt;a href=\"1973%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt;, he was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Cowboys\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for wide receiver &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Sellers\"&gt;Ron Sellers&lt;/a&gt; and a second round draft choice (#47-&lt;a href=\"Benny%20Malone\"&gt;Benny Malone&lt;/a&gt;). He played on two &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; teams, including the undefeated &lt;a href=\"1972%20Miami%20Dolphins%20season\"&gt;1972 Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt;.\nDallas Cowboys.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1973%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt;, he was having a &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt; type season starting opposite to &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Hayes\"&gt;Bob Hayes&lt;/a&gt;, but suffered a broken ankle in the seventh game against the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Eagles\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;, that placed him on the &lt;a href=\"injured%20reserve%20list\"&gt;injured reserve list&lt;/a&gt; and would hamper him for the rest of his career. He was replaced with rookie &lt;a href=\"Drew%20Pearson%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Drew Pearson&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the season, but still led the team with 6 &lt;a href=\"touchdown\"&gt;touchdown&lt;/a&gt; receptions and was second in receiving with 389 yards.\nEven though he was starting for the Cowboys, he wasn't happy with his contract, so he was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Denver%20Broncos\"&gt;Denver Broncos&lt;/a&gt; for a third round draft choice (#75-&lt;a href=\"John%20Smith%20%28running%20back%29\"&gt;John Smith&lt;/a&gt;) on September 5, &lt;a href=\"1974%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;.\nDenver Broncos.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1974%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;, he had a disappointing season after not being fully recovered from his previous injury which limited his mobility. He appeared in 8 games, while registering 2 receptions for 9 yards and one touchdown. On May 6, &lt;a href=\"1975%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1975&lt;/a&gt;, he was traded along with a sixth round draft choice (#156-&lt;a href=\"Art%20Best\"&gt;Art Best&lt;/a&gt;) to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Rams\"&gt;Los Angeles Rams&lt;/a&gt;, as compensation for signing &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Olsen%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Phil Olsen&lt;/a&gt;.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nOn August 18, Stowe informed the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Rams\"&gt;Los Angeles Rams&lt;/a&gt; of his decision to retire before the start of the &lt;a href=\"1975%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1975 season&lt;/a&gt;. He finished his career after only four seasons, registering 43 receptions, 742 yards, and 10 &lt;a href=\"touchdown\"&gt;touchdown&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1976, he was a college football graduate assistant at &lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20University\"&gt;Washington State University&lt;/a&gt;. The next year, he became the wide receivers coach at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Pittsburgh\"&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;."
