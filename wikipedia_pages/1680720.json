    "text": "Rock ()\nis a coastal &lt;a href=\"fishing%20village\"&gt;fishing village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cornwall\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;, England, United Kingdom. It is opposite &lt;a href=\"Padstow\"&gt;Padstow&lt;/a&gt; on the north-east bank of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Camel\"&gt;River Camel&lt;/a&gt; estuary. The village is in the &lt;a href=\"civil%20parish\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"St%20Minver\"&gt;St Minver Lowlands&lt;/a&gt; \nabout north-west of &lt;a href=\"Wadebridge\"&gt;Wadebridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nToponymy.\nThe original name recorded in 1303 was , &lt;a href=\"Cornish%20language\"&gt;Cornish&lt;/a&gt; for 'the end or head of stones'. An alternative, \"Blaketorre\" ('Black Tor'), is found in 1337. This had become \"Black Rock\" by the 18th century and was subsequently shortened to Rock. The name of the ferry that operates between Rock and Padstow recalls the old place name.\nGeography.\nThe main residential area is set back from the coast along the road from &lt;a href=\"Pityme\"&gt;Pityme&lt;/a&gt; and St Minver. To the northeast, Rock is contiguous with the settlements of &lt;a href=\"Splatt%2C%20Cornwall\"&gt;Splatt&lt;/a&gt; and Pityme. Stoptide is a southern extension of Rock. Rock is best known for its estuary frontage. To the northwest, the road runs beside the estuary as a &lt;a href=\"cul%20de%20sac\"&gt;cul de sac&lt;/a&gt; giving access to the ferry boarding point and an &lt;a href=\"intertidal\"&gt;intertidal&lt;/a&gt; beach backed by &lt;a href=\"sand%20dunes\"&gt;sand dunes&lt;/a&gt; which at &lt;a href=\"tide\"&gt;low water&lt;/a&gt; extend for two miles past &lt;a href=\"Brea%20Hill%2C%20Trebetherick\"&gt;Brea Hill&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Daymer%20Bay\"&gt;Daymer Bay&lt;/a&gt;. To the south is the small coastal settlement of &lt;a href=\"Porthilly\"&gt;Porthilly&lt;/a&gt; with St Michael's Church situated on the bank of Porthilly Cove.\nRock Dunes.\nRock Dunes, sand dunes to the west of the village on the banks of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Camel\"&gt;River Camel&lt;/a&gt;, are designated a &lt;a href=\"Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest\"&gt;Site of Special Scientific Interest&lt;/a&gt; for their &lt;a href=\"Flora%20and%20fauna%20of%20Cornwall\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"geology\"&gt;geology&lt;/a&gt;. These include various vegetation found in these embryo dunes as well as various types of &lt;a href=\"slate\"&gt;slate&lt;/a&gt;.\nTourism.\nRock is popular with holidaymakers and in 1881 the hotel was enlarged, a new sea-wall built and a bathing house erected on the beach. In the same year &lt;a href=\"Silvanus%20Trevail\"&gt;Silvanus Trevail&lt;/a&gt; designed and built two large villas. It is now a well-established centre for water sports including &lt;a href=\"dinghy%20racing\"&gt;dinghy racing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"waterskiing\"&gt;waterskiing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"windsurfing\"&gt;windsurfing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sailing\"&gt;sailing&lt;/a&gt;. Rock Sailing Club's headquarters, in a converted warehouse on a wharf, is a local landmark. Rock has Cornwall's highest proportion of &lt;a href=\"vacation%20property\"&gt;second homes&lt;/a&gt; in the county.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tor%20Ferry\"&gt;Black Tor Ferry&lt;/a&gt; operates across the river to the town of &lt;a href=\"Padstow\"&gt;Padstow&lt;/a&gt;, and this is a major source of tourist traffic through Rock. The early 21st century has seen extensive building work and increased prosperity for Rock, there a large number of holiday homes, as well as a number of retail outlets. Rock is also home to &lt;a href=\"Sharp%27s%20Brewery\"&gt;Sharp's Brewery&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"real%20ale\"&gt;real ale&lt;/a&gt; brewery established as an independent in the mid 1990s, but taken over by &lt;a href=\"Molson%20Coors\"&gt;Molson Coors&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 to secure the Doom Bar &lt;a href=\"bitter%20%28beer%29\"&gt;bitter&lt;/a&gt; brand.\nRock has been referred to as 'Britain's &lt;a href=\"Saint-Tropez\"&gt;Saint-Tropez&lt;/a&gt;' and the '&lt;a href=\"Kensington\"&gt;Kensington&lt;/a&gt; of Cornwall' due to its popularity with affluent holidaymakers. The Daily Telegraph has also called it Chelsea-on-Sea and stated that David Cameron's favourite beer is brewed there.\nAffluent visitors such as &lt;a href=\"Mohamed%20Al-Fayed\"&gt;Mohamed Al-Fayed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Kay\"&gt;Jay Kay&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Jamiroquai\"&gt;Jamiroquai&lt;/a&gt; often arrive by helicopter."
