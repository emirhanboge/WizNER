Fowler joined the cast shortly after producers decided to add several new cast members, in a bid to improve the serial. Zoe is described as being \"fickle and unpredictable to an incredible degree\", she is also blunt with a sharp wit. Zoe was described by James Oram, author of \"Neighbours: Behind the scenes\", as being \"fickle and unpredictable to an incredible degree\", she is blunt and has a sharp wit. Josephine Monroe, who wrote \"The Neighbours Programme Guide\", noted that Zoe was both \"charming and infuriating\". Zoe was an old school friend of &lt;a href=\"Daphne%20Clarke\"&gt;Daphne Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Elaine%20Smith%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Elaine Smith&lt;/a&gt;) and she came to &lt;a href=\"Erinsborough\"&gt;Erinsborough&lt;/a&gt; for her wedding to &lt;a href=\"Des%20Clarke%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Des Clarke&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Paul%20Keane\"&gt;Paul Keane&lt;/a&gt;). She later developed a relationship with the much older &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Jim Robinson&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Alan%20Dale\"&gt;Alan Dale&lt;/a&gt;), which shocked the other Ramsay Street residents.\nMadge Mitchell.\nMadge Mitchell, played by veteran actress &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Charleston\"&gt;Anne Charleston&lt;/a&gt;, made her first screen appearance on 20 January 1986. The character was introduced as &lt;a href=\"Max%20Ramsay\"&gt;Max Ramsay&lt;/a&gt;'s (&lt;a href=\"Francis%20Bell%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Francis Bell&lt;/a&gt;) elder sister. Max found Madge to be \"formidable\" and never won when she was around. Hilary Kingsley, author of \"Soap Box\", stated that Madge was \"loud, but likeable, meddlesome but cuddlesome, she has an opinion on everyone, ridiculous often but usually right.\" Madge went back to using her maiden name to avoid being associated with her ex-husband's debts. She is the mother of &lt;a href=\"Charlene%20Robinson\"&gt;Charlene&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kylie%20Minogue\"&gt;Kylie Minogue&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Ramsay%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Henry&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Craig%20McLachlan\"&gt;Craig McLachlan&lt;/a&gt;).

Charleston quit \"Neighbours\" in 1992, but when she suffered financial difficulties, she returned in 1996. She quit the serial once again in 2001.\nMike Young.\nMike Young, played by &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Pearce\"&gt;Guy Pearce&lt;/a&gt;, made his first screen appearance on 20 January 1986. Pearce auditioned for the role of Mike and immediately impressed casting director &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Russ\"&gt;Jan Russ&lt;/a&gt;. Pearce joined the soap on 3 December 1985, three days after he finished his last &lt;a href=\"Higher%20School%20Certificate%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;HSC&lt;/a&gt; exam. He commented \"I moved to Melbourne over the weekend and started \"Neighbours\" on the Tuesday. It was crazy. It was the whole, 'Say the words and don't bump into the furniture' thing. I had no idea what I was doing.\" Patrick Barkham from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" called Mike \"nice-but-lonely\". While David Astle from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald\"&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;\" described Mike as \"mullet-mopped\" and \"hunky.\"\nClive Gibbons.\nClive Gibbons, played by Geoff Paine, made his first appearance on 21 January 1986. A representative from The Grundy Organisation discovered Paine acting in a college production at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Arts%20Centre%20%28Melbourne%29\"&gt;Victoria Arts Centre&lt;/a&gt; and asked him to do a screen test, before offering him the role of Clive. Clive was a doctor who ran a gorillagram agency. He brought a \"breath of fresh air to Ramsay Street\" when he moved in. Josephine Monroe, author of \"Neighbours: The First 10 Years\", described Clive as being \"one of life's eccentrics\" who took care of people and often lured them into his latest harebrained scheme. Clive became so popular with viewers that a &lt;a href=\"Television%20pilot\"&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; for his own show called \"City Hospital\" was made, although it was not picked up by any television networks.\nNikki Dennison.\nNikki Dennison, played by Charlene Fenn, made her first screen appearance on 28 January 1986. A representative from the &lt;a href=\"Reg%20Grundy%20Organisation\"&gt;Grundy Organisation&lt;/a&gt; discovered Fenn at a &lt;a href=\"National%20Theatre%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;National Theatre&lt;/a&gt; workshop and signed her up to play &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Daniels\"&gt;Helen Daniels&lt;/a&gt;' (&lt;a href=\"Anne%20Haddy\"&gt;Anne Haddy&lt;/a&gt;) niece, Nikki. Of Nikki's background, Fenn explained \"Nikki's widowed mother works in a bar to send her to a good boarding school, but Nikki doesn't really appreciate this because she feels her mum has forced her into a position where she has to lie to be accepted by other girls.\" There are two sides to Nikki; one is a genuine and charming and the other has elements of bitchiness and social climbing. Fenn thought the two sides to Nikki made her an interesting character to play. The actress left \"Neighbours\" less than a year after she arrived and she commented \"I never thought I was going to be employed in this for the rest of my life.\"\nNikki was raised by her mother, &lt;a href=\"%23Laura%20Dennison\"&gt;Laura&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Carole%20Skinner\"&gt;Carole Skinner&lt;/a&gt;), in Queensland. Her father, Tom, died when she was young and Nikki became spoilt as Laura gave her everything she wanted. Laura found it hard to deal with Nikki when she became a teenager and decided to send her to Erinsborough to stay with her aunt Helen. Nikki becomes good friends with &lt;a href=\"Charlene%20Robinson\"&gt;Charlene Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kylie%20Minogue\"&gt;Kylie Minogue&lt;/a&gt;) and she begins dating &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Young%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Mike Young&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Guy%20Pearce\"&gt;Guy Pearce&lt;/a&gt;), after he defends her from &lt;a href=\"%23Sue%20Parker\"&gt;Sue Parker&lt;/a&gt;'s (Kate Gorman) rumours. When &lt;a href=\"Lucy%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Lucy Robinson&lt;/a&gt; (Kylie Flinker) wins a dinner date with &lt;a href=\"Grant%20Kenny\"&gt;Grant Kenny&lt;/a&gt;, Nikki tells her that her father will not let her go on the date and that Grant would not want to have dinner with a child. Nikki manages to persuade Lucy that she should go on the date instead and she gives her some money. Nikki does not tell Helen about the date and lies that she is spending the night studying with a friend. The date with Grant does not go well and he leaves after the main course. Nikki brags to Sue that she had a great night and that she kissed Grant. She also tells her that Grant is going to call her about a second date. However, Nikki's lies are exposed when a photo of herself and Grant appears in a newspaper. Mike then threatens to end their relationship. When Nikki hears that her mother has been diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"multiple%20sclerosis\"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, she leaves Erinsborough to be with her. When she returns a few months later, Nikki expects to pick up her relationship with Mike, but she soon learns that he is dating &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Harris%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Jane Harris&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Annie%20Jones%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Annie Jones&lt;/a&gt;).

Nikki decides to leave Erinsborough permanently to spend time with her mother in the United States.\nRosemary Daniels.\nRosemary Daniels, played by &lt;a href=\"Joy%20Chambers\"&gt;Joy Chambers&lt;/a&gt;, made her first screen appearance on 20 February 1986. Rosemary is the only character who has always been in the show, although only on a recurring basis. A writer for the official \"Neighbours\" website described Rosemary as being \"ruthless\", while a &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Soap\"&gt;Holy Soap&lt;/a&gt; reporter called a \"tough businesswoman\". A notable storyline for the character, saw her become engaged to Gerard Singer (&lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Marshall\"&gt;Bryan Marshall&lt;/a&gt;) and then learn that he was having an affair with her mother &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Daniels\"&gt;Helen Daniels&lt;/a&gt; (Anne Haddy). Chambers returned to \"Neighbours\" from 6 July 2010 as part of the show's 25th anniversary.\nLaura Dennison.\nLaura Dennison, played by &lt;a href=\"Carole%20Skinner\"&gt;Carole Skinner&lt;/a&gt;, made her first screen appearance on 21 March 1986. Laura is &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Daniels\"&gt;Helen Daniels&lt;/a&gt;' (&lt;a href=\"Anne%20Haddy\"&gt;Anne Haddy&lt;/a&gt;) sister. A picture of Laura sat on Helen's sideboard for years after her last appearance. Laura is also &lt;a href=\"%23Nikki%20Dennison\"&gt;Nikki Dennison&lt;/a&gt;'s (Charlene Fenn) mother. After she was widowed, Laura began working in a bar to help pay for Nikki's boarding school fees.\nLaura's sister, Helen, invites her to Erinsborough for a holiday. Nikki refuses to spend any time with her mother and calls her an embarrassment when Laura flirts with &lt;a href=\"Max%20Ramsay\"&gt;Max Ramsay&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Francis%20Bell%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Francis Bell&lt;/a&gt;). Laura is delighted when Max invites her to dinner and the evening goes well, until Max's son and sister return home. Laura goes back to Helen's and talks to Nikki about her attitude. Nikki chooses to leave her school and move in with Helen. Laura tells her sister that she is going back to her home town and just before she leaves, Nikki realises that she loves her mother and they reunite. They then spend the day repairing their relationship. Laura tells Max that she hopes they will remain friends before leaving. Helen goes to visit Laura and discovers that she has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Nikki then returns home to care for her mother.\nA few months later, Laura and Nikki return. Laura finds Nikki's over-protectiveness of her a little overwhelming and she arranges for Nikki to take part in an exchange programme in America, but Nikki refuses to go. Laura spills tea on herself and Helen begins to think that her sister cannot be left on her own. When Helen's friend, &lt;a href=\"%23Grace%20Barnett\"&gt;Grace Barnett&lt;/a&gt; (Marijke Mann), comes to Erinsborough, Laura realises that Helen is not aware that Grace had a one-night stand with her late husband, Bill. Laura convinces Grace to leave town, but when Helen matches her handwriting to a note left with some flowers on Bill's grave, Laura is forced to tell Helen the truth about Grace and Bill. Helen asks Laura to move out, but she soon realises that throwing her sister out is wrong and apologises. Laura takes up jogging and begins working some shifts at The Waterhole. Nikki asks her mother to slow down and &lt;a href=\"Clive%20Gibbons\"&gt;Clive Gibbons&lt;/a&gt; (Geoff Paine) arranges for a counsellor to talk to her. Nikki later arranges for Laura to go to the United States and she joins her after her exams.\nJack Lassiter.\nJack Lassiter, played by &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Hopgood\"&gt;Alan Hopgood&lt;/a&gt;, made his first screen appearance on 9 April 1986. Hopgood was well known for his role as Wally in \"&lt;a href=\"Prisoner%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;\", by the time he was cast in \"Neighbours\". Jack was introduced as the owner of Lassiter's Hotel and the local pub, The Waterhole, which have been central to storylines throughout the show's history. He departed on 27 June 1986.\nOn 8 August 2013, it was announced that Hopgood had reprised his role for a month long guest appearance. Hopgood was reunited with co-star &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Dennis\"&gt;Stefan Dennis&lt;/a&gt; and he commented \"I thoroughly enjoyed returning to the set. In some ways things hadn't changed and others it was very different which made it interesting. It didn't take long at all the settle back in, everyone made me feel very welcome. It was terrific working with Stefan again who is so professional and I also enjoyed working with the new cast.\" Hopgood regrew his character's moustache for his return. The actor told Lawrence Money from \"&lt;a href=\"WAtoday\"&gt;WAtoday&lt;/a&gt;\" that Jack \"is wealthy, slightly eccentric and was married off but, several divorces later, he's back and wanting to do something charitable with this money.\" Jack came back to Erinsborough to \"reconcile with his past actions\" by giving away some of his fortune. Jack returned on 27 August.\nFormer &lt;a href=\"gold%20prospector\"&gt;gold prospector&lt;/a&gt; Jack Lassiter moved to Erinsborough with his wife, Addie, and bought the local hotel, naming it Lassiter's. He also created The Waterhole pub. Jack lived in a caravan by the lake, when Addie died, Jack retreated into himself. &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Paul Robinson&lt;/a&gt; (Dennis) becomes desperate to buy Lassiter's and pays &lt;a href=\"%23Andrea%20Townsend\"&gt;Andrea Townsend&lt;/a&gt; (Gina Gaigalas) to try and convince Jack to sell to him. Jack realises what Paul has done and gets his own back by telling Paul that he will sell, only to change his mind a week later. Jack grows close to Andrea, but her son, &lt;a href=\"%23Bradley%20Townsend\"&gt;Bradley&lt;/a&gt; (Bradley Kilpatrick), does not like the relationship. When he acts up, Jack smacks Bradley and Andrea throws him out. He later apologises and explains to Bradley that he will not come between him and his mother. Jack tells Andrea about his feelings for her and proposes. Andrea accepts, but confesses to Jack that while she cares for him, she does not love him. Jack does not mind, saying that he will settle for being liked. Jack tells Andrea that he wants to move to the outback, but realising that Andrea is unhappy with the plan, he tells her that they will be going to Paris after the wedding and then they will travel around Europe. While Jack does not feel ready to sell his hotel, he asks Paul to manage it for six months. Jack later contacts the Daniels Corporation from Europe and tells Paul and &lt;a href=\"Rosemary%20Daniels\"&gt;Rosemary Daniels&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Joy%20Chambers\"&gt;Joy Chambers&lt;/a&gt;) that he is ready to sell them the hotel.\nJack returns to Erinsborough twenty seven years later. He goes to Charlie's bar and reminisces about how it used to be called The Waterhole. He then proceeds to Lassiter's Hotel, where he asks &lt;a href=\"Terese%20Willis\"&gt;Terese Willis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Rebekah%20Elmaloglou\"&gt;Rebekah Elmaloglou&lt;/a&gt;) for his favourite room. Terese gets him the room and then learns that Jack is the man who started the Lassiter's empire. Jack reacquaints himself with Paul again and recognises that he is lonely. Jack acquaints himself with &lt;a href=\"Susan%20Kennedy\"&gt;Susan Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Woodburne\"&gt;Jackie Woodburne&lt;/a&gt;), the principal of the local high school, and helps her to get the radio station up and running again. Jack also helps &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Willis%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Josh Willis&lt;/a&gt; (Harley Bonner) to organise a series of treasure hunts for the local community, using his money for the prizes. Jack continues to worry about Paul and his lack of friends and family. Jack collapses from a heart attack and &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Brooks\"&gt;Georgia Brooks&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Saskia%20Hampele\"&gt;Saskia Hampele&lt;/a&gt;) saves his life. When Jack returns to Lassiter's, Paul learns that he cannot pay his bill. Jack informs Paul that he has given away all his money as he has an inoperable brain aneurysm. Jack gives Paul the location of the last treasure hunt prize, so he can pay his bill, but Paul pays the bill himself. Jack leaves Erinsborough and dies a few weeks later.\nCharlene Mitchell.\nCharlene Mitchell, played by &lt;a href=\"Kylie%20Minogue\"&gt;Kylie Minogue&lt;/a&gt;, made her first screen appearance on 17 April 1986. Minogue was originally signed to appear in \"Neighbours\" for one week, but this was then extended to 13 weeks and later through to mid-1988. Minogue thought viewers liked her character as she was portrayed as an average Australian teenager, experiencing a difficult relationship with her mother. Charlene was \"a bit of a rebel\", outspoken and tomboyish.\nThe character's style often consisted of khaki overalls, baggy sweatshirts and her hair set in a &lt;a href=\"Perm%20%28hairstyle%29\"&gt;perm&lt;/a&gt;. Both Charlene and Minogue became popular with viewers in Australia and Britain. The character had a highly publicised relationship with &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Scott Robinson&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jason%20Donovan\"&gt;Jason Donovan&lt;/a&gt;).\nNell Mangel.\nNell Mangel, played by &lt;a href=\"Vivean%20Gray\"&gt;Vivean Gray&lt;/a&gt;, made her first screen appearance on 29 April 1986. The character was originally supposed to appear in \"Neighbours\" for three weeks. However, the character proved popular with viewers and she became a permanent member of the cast. The character was rarely addressed by her Christian name and was referred to as Mrs Mangel. Dave Hogan and Neil Wallis described Mrs Mangel as being \"frosty and disliked by the residents of Ramsay Street.\" The character was well known for being an interfering busy body and she developed a rivalry with neighbour, &lt;a href=\"Madge%20Bishop\"&gt;Madge Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Anne%20Charleston\"&gt;Anne Charleston&lt;/a&gt;). A reporter from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Scotsman\"&gt;The Scotsman&lt;/a&gt;\" though Gray made more of an impact in her time on \"Neighbours\" than some actors make in their entire careers. They added that Mrs Mangel was \"one of the most detestable villains ever to set foot in Ramsay Street.\"\nTom Ramsay.\nTom Ramsay, played by &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Files\"&gt;Gary Files&lt;/a&gt;, made his first screen appearance on 12 May 1986. After &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Bell%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Francis Bell&lt;/a&gt; became unhappy with his role as &lt;a href=\"Max%20Ramsay\"&gt;Max Ramsay&lt;/a&gt;, he quit the serial. Files was signed up to play Max's younger brother, Tom, who was introduced to cover the rest of Max's storylines. Tom was described as being \"a carbon copy\" of Max by Josephine Monroe, author of \"The Neighbours Programme Guide\". She quipped that he took over Max's house, business and \"evidently also his wardrobe of overalls and dungarees\". The author also called him a \"blustering fool\". Tom departed on 2 February 1991. A writer for the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Neighbours\" website said Tom's most notable moment was \"Confronting Matt Robinson after Gemma's motorcycle accident.\" Files reprised his role for \"Neighbours\" 30th anniversary in March 2015. Tom returns for his great-nephew &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt;'s (&lt;a href=\"Tim%20Phillipps\"&gt;Tim Phillipps&lt;/a&gt;) wedding and helps solve the mystery of a missing heirloom.\nTom comes to Erinsborough to take over his brother, Max's plumbing business. He moves in with his sister, &lt;a href=\"Madge%20Bishop\"&gt;Madge&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Anne%20Charleston\"&gt;Anne Charleston&lt;/a&gt;), in Ramsay Street. Madge and Tom constantly argue with each other, especially when Tom announces that he wants to sell Number 24 to a property developer. Tom is set to go ahead with the sale until Madge convinces him that it is the Ramsay family home. Tom recognises &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Young%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Mike Young&lt;/a&gt;'s (&lt;a href=\"Guy%20Pearce\"&gt;Guy Pearce&lt;/a&gt;) potential as a swimmer and begins training him. However, Tom's nephew, &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Ramsay\"&gt;Danny&lt;/a&gt; (David Clencie), begins to feel left out and asks him to teach him how to play golf. However, Tom concentrates on training Mike and fails to recognise that he is neglecting Danny. Tom begins dating &lt;a href=\"%23Jean%20Richards\"&gt;Jean Richards&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Margot%20Knight\"&gt;Margot Knight&lt;/a&gt;) and she later introduces him to her husband, &lt;a href=\"%23Jeff%20Richards\"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt; (Paul Young), a quadriplegic who encourages her to be with Tom. When Tom eventually proposes to Jean, she turns him down. Jean is later killed in a car accident, which devastates Tom. Her death is made more painful, as Tom's nephew, &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Ramsay\"&gt;Shane&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Peter%20O%27Brien%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Peter O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;) was driving. Tom's mother, &lt;a href=\"%23Edna%20Ramsay\"&gt;Edna&lt;/a&gt; (Jessica Noad), comes to visit and she reveals that his estranged daughter, Moira, has given birth to a daughter. Tom, unaware that Moira had been pregnant, is surprised and decides to get in touch with Moira. He later goes to live with Moira in Queensland. He briefly returns to Ramsay Street to visit Madge and his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Gemma%20Ramsay\"&gt;Gemma&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Beth%20Buchanan\"&gt;Beth Buchanan&lt;/a&gt;). Tom's visit is stressful as Gemma had recently been involved in a motorbike accident and Tom confronts Gemma's boyfriend, &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Matt Robinson&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Paske\"&gt;Ashley Paske&lt;/a&gt;), the owner of the bike. Tom returns to Queensland soon after.\nYears later, Tom returns to Erinsborough for his great-nephew Daniel's wedding to &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Turner\"&gt;Amber Turner&lt;/a&gt; (Jenna Rosenow). He comes across &lt;a href=\"Imogen%20Willis\"&gt;Imogen Willis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ariel%20Kaplan\"&gt;Ariel Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;) looking at a picture of Agnes Robinson, and tells her how everyone tried to find her engagement ring after she threw it down a well. Tom then goes to see Daniel. He leaves after the wedding is cancelled.\nSue Parker.\nSue Parker, played by Kate Gorman, made her first screen appearance on 9 June 1986. Gorman appeared on \"Neighbours\" for two years. In their book, \"The Neighbours Factfile\", Neil Wallis and Dave Hogan, describe Sue as being \"bitchy\". A notable storyline for the character saw her play \"a cruel practical joke\" on &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Young%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Mike Young&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Guy%20Pearce\"&gt;Guy Pearce&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Scott Robinson&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jason%20Donovan\"&gt;Jason Donovan&lt;/a&gt;). Sue never got over Mike preferring &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Harris%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Jane Harris&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Annie%20Jones%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Annie Jones&lt;/a&gt;) to her and vowed to get even. When Sue heard that Mike and Scott had written a song and sent it to &lt;a href=\"Molly%20Meldrum\"&gt;Molly Meldrum&lt;/a&gt;, she called them up, pretending to be Molly's secretary, and invited them to come and sing the song in front of Molly. Mike and Scott soon discovered it was a hoax and Sue publicly gloated about what happened. Gorman returned as Sue in July 2014. Michael Cregan from \"&lt;a href=\"Inside%20Soap\"&gt;Inside Soap&lt;/a&gt;\" commented \"This is the best and most unexpected soap return ever!\"\nIn 2017, Johnathon Hughes of &lt;a href=\"Digital%20Spy\"&gt;Digital Spy&lt;/a&gt; included Sue in his \"7 of the most evil mean girls in soap\" list. Of the character, Hughes stated \"In the '80s, surly Sue and her daggy side-parting was a total bullying beeyach to Charlene (she tried to split up her and Scott, which is completely unforgivable) and her best mate Jane Harris (or \"Plain Jane Superbrain\" to give the girl her full title). In one memorable scene, mousy Jane finally thumped her and we all cheered.\" Gorman returned to filming in late 2017, and made her on-screen return as Sue on 7 February 2018.\nSue spreads malicious rumours about &lt;a href=\"%23Nikki%20Dennison\"&gt;Nikki Dennison&lt;/a&gt; (Charlene Fenn) and develops a crush on Mike Young. Sue is not happy when Mike begins dating Jane Harris and she sends poison pen letters about Mike to &lt;a href=\"Nell%20Mangel\"&gt;Nell Mangel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Vivean%20Gray\"&gt;Vivean Gray&lt;/a&gt;), hoping that she will stop Jane from seeing Mike, but &lt;a href=\"Daphne%20Clarke\"&gt;Daphne Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Elaine%20Smith%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Elaine Smith&lt;/a&gt;) catches her. Jane later punches Sue and her friends cover for her. Sue tells her father, &lt;a href=\"%23Bill%20Parker\"&gt;Bill&lt;/a&gt; (Mark Allen) that it was a gang attack and he threatens to sue all four parties involved. However, Jane owns up to punching Sue and explains about the letters. Sue admits to exaggerating her story and her father backs down. Sue remains bitter about Mike choosing Jane over her and she decides to play a joke on him and Scott Robinson. Sue pretends to be Molly Meldrum's, secretary and tells Mike and Scott that Molly heard the demo they sent in and wants to see them in person. The joke backfires on Sue when Molly meets with Mike and Scott and praises their song.\nSue causes Scott and &lt;a href=\"Charlene%20Robinson\"&gt;Charlene Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;'s (&lt;a href=\"Kylie%20Minogue\"&gt;Kylie Minogue&lt;/a&gt;) break up, when she tells Scott that Charlene and &lt;a href=\"%23Warren%20Murphy\"&gt;Warren Murphy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ben%20Mendelsohn\"&gt;Ben Mendelsohn&lt;/a&gt;) kissed. When Sue overhears Scott has written some formulas on his arms to cheat in an exam, she tells &lt;a href=\"%23Mr%20White\"&gt;Mr White&lt;/a&gt; (Douglas Bennett), who confronts Scott. But Scott has already washed off the writing, leaving Sue looking like a liar. After they leave school, Sue become a trainee at the local bank. She runs into Scott and apologises for being rough on him at school. Sue dates Charlene's brother, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Ramsay%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Henry Ramsay&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Craig%20McLachlan\"&gt;Craig McLachlan&lt;/a&gt;), which upsets Charlene. Sue tries to prove to her that she has changed. She later moves into a caravan with Charlene, but the pair do not get along. When Henry is arrested for robbery, Sue offers to give him a false alibi. Warren warns Sue not to lie for Henry, explaining that she could lose her job, and she agrees not to. Sue begins staying at Warren's place, and when the caravan burns down, she continues to stay there, which annoys Henry. He asks Sue to move in with him, threatening to break up with her if she does not. Sue refuses and leaves with Warren.\nSue comes into regular contact with Scott's brother &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Dennis\"&gt;Stefan Dennis&lt;/a&gt;) through her job as an Erinsborough councillor. When Sue's son, &lt;a href=\"Jayden%20Warley\"&gt;Jayden&lt;/a&gt; (Khan Oxenham), buys a skateboard from &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Willis%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Josh Willis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Harley%20Bonner\"&gt;Harley Bonner&lt;/a&gt;), and then injures himself trying to recreate a stunt he had seen Josh performing, Sue threatens to sue Josh. Scott and Charlene's son, &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Daniel Robinson&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tim%20Phillipps\"&gt;Tim Phillipps&lt;/a&gt;) speaks to Sue and reminds her of the poison pen letters she sent and the rest of the bad things she did when she was a teenager. Sue agrees to drop the case. When Paul is suspended from his job as mayor, Sue is voted in as interim mayor. When Paul arranges an event at the local plant nursery, to announce that he is ready to take up his job again, the nursery is trashed by Jayden. Paul forces a confession out of him and when Sue learns what her son did, she steps down as interim mayor, so Paul will not press charges against Jayden. Sue later berates Paul for using community service workers to clear out The Waterhole's office. When Sue's husband &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Warley\"&gt;Bill Warley&lt;/a&gt; (Darren Mort) sees an old photo of Sue and Paul kissing, he realises that she had an affair while they were dating and he punches Paul. Sue and Paul reminisce about that day, and Sue apologises for Bill's actions.\nWhen Paul starts missing council meetings, Sue becomes suspicious and visits his penthouse to find out what is going on. Sue suggests that Paul is no longer up to the job and he tells her to leave. She spots some anti-nausea pills on her way out and tries to find out more information from &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Kennedy\"&gt;Karl Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Alan%20Fletcher%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Alan Fletcher&lt;/a&gt;). Paul then calls a council meeting and announces that he has leukaemia. Weeks later, Sue attends a friend's birthday party and propositions Josh after watching his dance routine. Josh declines her offer. &lt;a href=\"Naomi%20Canning\"&gt;Naomi Canning&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Morgana%20O%27Reilly\"&gt;Morgana O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt;) applies for an events job with the council, but Sue refuses to consider her application as she is in a relationship with Paul. Naomi learns about Josh and blackmails Sue, who lets her organise the launch party for the new childcare centre. Sue sabotages &lt;a href=\"Susan%20Kennedy\"&gt;Susan Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Woodburne\"&gt;Jackie Woodburne&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Willis%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Brad Willis&lt;/a&gt;'s (&lt;a href=\"Kip%20Gamblin\"&gt;Kip Gamblin&lt;/a&gt;) chances of saving Erinsborough High from closure. She is later fired from her job when it emerges she accepted a bribe from Paul to get his housing estate plans approved quickly.\nA couple of years later, Sue learns Paul is taking over a half-finished housing development. She tells him that the original owners of the development underpaid the mostly elderly home owners who were already there. Sue points out that if that information becomes public knowledge, then Paul's housing development will be tainted. She agrees to keep quiet, but only if Paul gives Jayden a job on the development. Paul gets his daughter &lt;a href=\"Amy%20Williams%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Amy Williams&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Zoe%20Cramond\"&gt;Zoe Cramond&lt;/a&gt;) to hire Jayden at her builders yard. The truth about the home owners being underpaid is leaked to the press, and Paul assumes Sue is responsible, but she denies it. &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Humphreys\"&gt;Rafael Humphreys&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Thomas\"&gt;Ryan Thomas&lt;/a&gt;) overhears Sue talking about Paul, and they team up to discredit Paul's reputation and the housing development. Sue asks Jayden to loosen the ratchet straps on a truck carrying concrete slabs, so they will fall off. &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Tanaka\"&gt;Leo Tanaka&lt;/a&gt; (Tim Kano) is injured by the falling slabs, and Sue and Jayden's involvement in the accident is revealed. They receive a six-month prison sentence each.\nJane Harris.\nJane Harris, played by &lt;a href=\"Annie%20Jones%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Annie Jones&lt;/a&gt;, made her first on-screen appearance on 31 July 1986.

Josephine Monroe, author of \"The Neighbours Programme Guide\", quipped that it was apparent where Dan's sons &lt;a href=\"Max%20Ramsay\"&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Francis%20Bell%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Francis Bell&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Ramsay\"&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Gary%20Files\"&gt;Gary Files&lt;/a&gt;) got their \"pig-headedness\" from and thought he was worse than both of them put together. When Edna found out that she and Dan were not legally married, Monroe thought it was due to Dan's \"typical incompetence\". Dan and Edna, who were on the brink of separating for good, were eventually married and they headed back to Brisbane. A writer for the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Neighbours\" website said Dan's most notable moment was \"Marrying his wife of 50 years after their original marriage was shown to be invalid!\" In her book, \"Neighbours: the first 10 years\", Josephine Monroe said Dan and Edna's wedding was one of the \"most moving\" and simplest ceremonies.\nDan was born in Erinsborough, but he moved to Brisbane to find work.

Dan takes an instant dislike to &lt;a href=\"Clive%20Gibbons\"&gt;Clive Gibbons&lt;/a&gt; (Geoff Paine) after he almost drives over Dan's suitcase.

Dan makes sure that all the neighbours know about his family's history and he clashes with the Robinson family. Dan's granddaughter, &lt;a href=\"Charlene%20Robinson\"&gt;Charlene&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kylie%20Minogue\"&gt;Kylie Minogue&lt;/a&gt;), is thrilled that he is staying, but Tom is not and he refuses to let his father stay with him. However, Dan insists on staying. He later harasses Madge at The Waterhole for free drinks, but refuses to tell her why he had left Edna on her own. Tom discovers that Edna is staying with Max and Madge invites her to Erinsborough. Edna is not happy to see Dan and they barely tolerate each other. Dan tries to wind Edna up by talking about a date he had arranged with &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Daniels\"&gt;Helen Daniels&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Anne%20Haddy\"&gt;Anne Haddy&lt;/a&gt;). Tom and Dan start to heal their rift by shaking hands.\nDan goes to dinner with Helen, but is unaware that she, Madge and Clive had come up with a plan to reunite him with Edna. Helen pretends to be rude and disagreeable, but Dan finds Helen even more attractive. Dan takes Helen to his home and Edna appears and asks for a divorce. Clive tells Dan that he is taking Edna on a date, which makes Dan jealous. Edna discovers that their marriage was never legal because Dan had got a cheap minister, who was actually a con artist, to marry them. Dan is shocked by the revelation and Edna accuses Dan of causing her to live in sin for years. They talk about their lives, but when Edna asks for a second chance, Dan tells her that it is too late for them to start over. Clive, Charlene, Madge and &lt;a href=\"Shane%20Ramsay\"&gt;Shane&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Peter%20O%27Brien%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Peter O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;) hatch a plan to get Dan and Edna together again. They make the couple nostalgic for the old days and Dan asks Edna to marry him. Dan and Edna get married in a small private ceremony in front of Madge, Charlene, Clive and Shane. Dan then takes Edna to Surfer's Paradise for their honeymoon.

Dan's ire is further provoked when &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Landers\"&gt;Todd&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kristian%20Schmid\"&gt;Kristian Schmid&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Katie%20Landers\"&gt;Katie Landers&lt;/a&gt; (Sally Jensen) change the street sign to Robinson Street. He then organises a card game between Scott and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Ramsay%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Henry Ramsay&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Craig%20McLachlan\"&gt;Craig McLachlan&lt;/a&gt;) and asks Charlene to fix the cards, so that Henry will win. Henry wins, even after Scott asks for the cards to be checked. Dan later suffers a heart attack in Brisbane and he is forced to miss Madge's wedding to Harold. A few months later, he offers a house to Charlene and Scott in Brisbane and they later name their son, &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt;, after him.\nRuth Wilson.\nRuth Wilson, played by Stephanie Daniel, made her first screen appearance on 1 September 1986.

She also realises that she will be unable to return to her two children back in England. Jim's son, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Dennis\"&gt;Stefan Dennis&lt;/a&gt;), refuses to help Ruth out, so Jim pays Ruth's bill and asks her to stay with him. Ruth is grateful to Jim and assures him that she will pay him back. Ruth befriends Jim's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Lucy%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Lucy&lt;/a&gt; (Kylie Flinker), and his mother-in-law, &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Daniels\"&gt;Helen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Anne%20Haddy\"&gt;Anne Haddy&lt;/a&gt;), but worries that she is outstaying her welcome.

Helen begins to resent having Ruth around after Ruth discovers that Lucy is faking an illness to get out of going to school. However, she admits that she is glad Jim has found someone who makes him happy.\nRuth gets a bank loan, but does not tell Jim straight away. She later confesses that she was stalling because she did not want to leave him and his family. Ruth makes plans to return home, but Jim asks her to stay and they kiss. Ruth then decides to move back to Lassiter's, so the family can get used to their relationship. After a family dinner, Ruth is invited to move back in. She is flattered when &lt;a href=\"%23Ted%20Gibbons\"&gt;Ted Gibbons&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Max%20Meldrum\"&gt;Max Meldrum&lt;/a&gt;) pays her some attention and when he reveals that he is going to visit England, Ruth suggests that they meet up. Jim admits that he does not love Ruth, but that he cares for her. Ruth tells Jim that she wants to return home in time for Christmas, but this upsets Lucy. After Lucy is recovered from a storm drain, she suffers from hysterical blindness and Ruth agrees to stay and look after her. Ruth explains that she will leave once Lucy's sight returns, but Paul is adamant that Ruth needs to leave.

Edna was very concerned with what the neighbours thought and was embarrassed by Dan. A &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; writer described Edna as having \"the patience of a saint\" and being generous, they added that she had a \"quiet strength.\" When Edna learned that she and Dan were not legally married, she was \"distraught\" at having lived in sin for nearly fifty years.

Mendelsohn won the role of Warren when he was seventeen. He commented \"I only did \"Neighbours\" for 6 weeks \u2013 it was actually the year my voice broke and then I did 6 weeks on \"Neighbours\", such is the life of the odd actor trying to make a buck.\" Mendelsohn befriended &lt;a href=\"Kylie%20Minogue\"&gt;Kylie Minogue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Donovan\"&gt;Jason Donovan&lt;/a&gt;, who had become very popular with viewers, and he described the attention they received as \"hectic\". Mendelsohn told \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;'s\" Alex Godfrey that he did not want that level of fame, saying \"I felt like a participant plenty enough. Within the circle of people I was working with, I was fairly well regarded, in my own way. So no, it was fun and silly, but I didn't look on with shades of green.\"\nWarren begins studying for his HSC with &lt;a href=\"Charlene%20Robinson\"&gt;Charlene Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; (Minogue) and &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Robinson%20%28Neighbours%29\"&gt;Scott Robinson&lt;/a&gt; (Donovan).

Warren's father, &lt;a href=\"%23Ray%20Murphy\"&gt;Ray Murphy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Norman%20Yemm\"&gt;Norman Yemm&lt;/a&gt;), advises him to cut down, but does not appear too concerned. Warren spends the night at his father's house and he admits that his mother is not happy about it. Warren also admits that he finds it difficult being caught between his parents. Ray tells Warren not to worry and gives him some money, which Warren spends on wine. A fellow student throws a party, which Warren and Charlene attend together. &lt;a href=\"%23Sue%20Parker\"&gt;Sue Parker&lt;/a&gt; (Kate Gorman) notices Warren's alcohol problem and she also calls Scott to tell him that Charlene and Warren kissed, causing them to break up.\nThe following day, Charlene has trouble remembering what happened and is surprised when Ray turns up and reveals Warren is unconscious after being beaten up. At the hospital, Charlene admits to the police that cannot remember the night before, which angers Ray.
