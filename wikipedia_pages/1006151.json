    "text": "Knotty Ash is an area of &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merseyside\"&gt;Merseyside&lt;/a&gt;, England, and a &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20City%20Council\"&gt;Liverpool City Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;Ward&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;Historically&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, the population at the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001\"&gt;2001 Census&lt;/a&gt; was 13,200, increasing to 13,312 at the 2011 Census. Knotty Ash is well known as the home of comedian &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Dodd\"&gt;Ken Dodd&lt;/a&gt;, who often mentioned it in his act.\nDescription.\nKnotty Ash is a small area on the eastern fringe of Liverpool and neighbours the &lt;a href=\"West%20Derby\"&gt;West Derby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Swan\"&gt;Old Swan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broadgreen\"&gt;Broadgreen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dovecot%2C%20Merseyside\"&gt;Dovecot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Huyton\"&gt;Huyton&lt;/a&gt; districts. Its name is derived from a gnarled &lt;a href=\"ash%20tree\"&gt;ash tree&lt;/a&gt; which formerly stood near the present-day Knotty Ash public house. In 2004, &lt;a href=\"comedian\"&gt;comedian&lt;/a&gt; and local resident &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Dodd\"&gt;Ken Dodd&lt;/a&gt; planted a new ash tree close to the site of the original.\nGovernance.\nKnotty Ash is represented on &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20City%20Council\"&gt;Liverpool City Council&lt;/a&gt; by three councillors and is wholly within the &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20West%20Derby%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Liverpool West Derby&lt;/a&gt; constituency. The current MP is &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Byrne%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Ian Byrne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;, since 2019.\nEducation.\nKnotty Ash contains the &lt;a href=\"special%20needs\"&gt;special needs&lt;/a&gt; secondary school &lt;a href=\"Clifford%20Holroyde\"&gt;Clifford Holroyde&lt;/a&gt; and a primary school, Knotty Ash CP.\nTransport.\nKnotty Ash has an extensive bus network which in the main uses the \"Prescot Road corridor\". Services 7, 8/9, 10/10A/10B, 15 and 204 link Knotty Ash to Liverpool City Centre and these services provide links to Dingle, Toxteth, Edge Hill, Kensington, Tuebrook, Wavertree, Old Swan, Stoneycroft, Broadgreen Hospital, Belle Vale, Page Moss and Huyton with some of these services going further afield to Prescot, Whiston, Cronton, Thatto Heath, St Helens, Penketh and Warrington. There are also services like the 61 (Bootle - Aigburth) and 102 (Page Moss/Broadgreen Hospital - Fazakerley Hospital) which don't service the city centre but provide links to various areas of North and South Liverpool, Knowsley and Sefton. There are also various \"industrial\" and \"school\" bus services which pass through Knotty Ash too.\n&lt;a href=\"Knotty%20Ash%20railway%20station\"&gt;Knotty Ash railway station&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"North%20Liverpool%20Extension%20Line\"&gt;North Liverpool Extension Line&lt;/a&gt; formerly served the area, but this closed to passenger traffic in 1960. The former trackway is now part of &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Network\"&gt;National Cycle Network&lt;/a&gt; Route 62. The nearest current National Rail station is &lt;a href=\"Broad%20Green%20railway%20station\"&gt;Broad Green&lt;/a&gt;, approximately a mile away from Knotty Ash where fairly regular trains go to/from &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20Lime%20Street%20railway%20station\"&gt;Liverpool Lime Street&lt;/a&gt; and generally continue on to &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20North%20Western%20railway%20station\"&gt;Wigan North Western&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Victoria%20railway%20station\"&gt;Manchester Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Bank%20Quay%20railway%20station\"&gt;Warrington Bank Quay&lt;/a&gt; stations.\nKnotty Ash is also approximately a mile away from the western terminus of the &lt;a href=\"M62%20motorway\"&gt;M62 motorway&lt;/a&gt;, \"Rocket Roundabout\" in &lt;a href=\"Broadgreen\"&gt;Broadgreen&lt;/a&gt;.\nSport.\nBetween 1951 and 1968, the district was home to the city's &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20Stanley\"&gt;Liverpool City&lt;/a&gt; who played at their Knotty Ash Stadium, Mill Yard. Their playing strip consisted of white jerseys with a broad green hoop and white shorts. After the 1967\u201368 season, they left the district and moved to nearby &lt;a href=\"Huyton\"&gt;Huyton&lt;/a&gt;, changing the club's name to Huyton RLFC. Having no home venue for the 1968\u201369 season, their new Huyton home ground of &lt;a href=\"River%20Alt\"&gt;Alt Park&lt;/a&gt; was opened for the following 1969\u201370 season."
