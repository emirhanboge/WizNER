    "text": "The Glamorgan County Silver Ball Trophy (also known as the Glamorgan County High Motive Silver Ball Trophy) is a &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; competition open to all non-premier &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Welsh Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; (WRU) clubs playing in the &lt;a href=\"Glamorgan\"&gt;Glamorgan&lt;/a&gt; area.\nHistory.\nThe Silver Ball competition was suggested by &lt;a href=\"Glamorgan%20County%20RFC\"&gt;Glamorgan County&lt;/a&gt; president Glan Williams in 1955. The first tournament took place in 1956 when J. Norman Hunt volunteered to meet the costs. It was open to all 64 WRU clubs in the Glamorgan region. The Silver Ball Trophy was made by Birmingham-based trophy maker Thomas Fattorini Ltd and cost \u00a3100 to produce. The idea was to match eight junior teams against the county's eight first class sides, but a poor response from the senior teams resulted in the Welsh Academicals being drafted in to make a realistic quarter finals.\nThe tournament also produces the SA Brains trophy which is awarded to the team to have scored the most tries during the buildup to the final. This team is then invited to play the Silver Ball winners in a pre-season friendly for the President's Cup.\nThe trophy is sponsored by Chemical Corporation.(since season 2019/20"
