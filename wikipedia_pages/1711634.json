    "text": "William Orville DeWitt Jr. (born August 31, 1941) is an &lt;a href=\"Americans\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; businessman who is currently the &lt;a href=\"Partner%20%28business%20rank%29\"&gt;managing partner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chairman\"&gt;chairman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Professional%20sports%20league%20organization\"&gt;franchise&lt;/a&gt; which competes in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; (MLB). \n The Cardinals have won two &lt;a href=\"World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 in &lt;a href=\"2006%20World%20Series\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2011%20World%20Series\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 during DeWitt's time as owner. In addition to the Cardinals, DeWitt has also owned or invested in the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Stingers\"&gt;Cincinnati Stingers&lt;/a&gt; hockey club, &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Orioles\"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt;. Business interests outside baseball include Reynolds, DeWitt &amp; Co., which owns &lt;a href=\"Arby%27s\"&gt;Arby's&lt;/a&gt; franchises and invests in &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Playing%20Card%20Company\"&gt;U.S. Playing Card Company&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Petroleum%20industry\"&gt;petroleum&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href=\"Spectrum%207\"&gt;Spectrum 7&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nDeWitt, the son of longtime &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; executive &lt;a href=\"Bill%20DeWitt\"&gt;Bill DeWitt&lt;/a&gt;, and Margaret H. DeWitt, was born in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, where he attended &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Institute%20and%20St.%20Louis%20Country%20Day%20School\"&gt;St. Louis Country Day School&lt;/a&gt;. He was around baseball constantly as a child; his father owned the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Browns\"&gt;St. Louis Browns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt;, and DeWitt served as a Browns batboy. On August 19, 1951, the little person &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Gaedel\"&gt;Eddie Gaedel&lt;/a&gt; served as a pinch hitter at a Browns game, wearing DeWitt's jersey to the plate. He earned a bachelor's degree from &lt;a href=\"Yale%20University\"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt; in economics in 1963, and an &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Business%20Administration\"&gt;M.B.A.&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; in 1965.\nEarly business ventures (1974\u201395).\nDewitt joined Cincinnati investment firm &lt;a href=\"McDonald%20%26amp%3B%20Co.\"&gt;Gradison &amp; Co&lt;/a&gt;. in 1974. In 1979, along with &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Reynolds\"&gt;Mercer Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;, he founded the investment firm &lt;a href=\"Reynolds%2C%20DeWitt%20%26amp%3B%20Co.\"&gt;Reynolds, DeWitt &amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt; The firm owns 63 &lt;a href=\"Arby%27s\"&gt;Arby's&lt;/a&gt; franchises whose value has been estimated at $50.4 million and is an investor in &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Playing%20Card%20Company\"&gt;U.S. Playing Card Company&lt;/a&gt;, with an estimated value of about $120 million. It also holds a $40 million stake in &lt;a href=\"Newport%20Aquarium\"&gt;Newport Aquarium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Newport%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Newport, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;. DeWitt is also involved with DeWitt Capital Group, a private equity firm registered in 2012. DeWitt has been part owner of the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Orioles\"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1984, one of DeWitt's business ventures, the &lt;a href=\"Petroleum%20industry\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href=\"Spectrum%207\"&gt;Spectrum 7&lt;/a&gt;, bought &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Arbusto%20Energy\"&gt;Arbusto Energy&lt;/a&gt;, and in turn merged with &lt;a href=\"Harken%20Energy\"&gt;Harken Energy&lt;/a&gt; in 1986. When &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Chiles\"&gt;Eddie Chiles&lt;/a&gt; prepared to sell the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt; baseball franchise in 1989, DeWitt and Bush gathered investors to buy the team.\nDeWitt has also held shares in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Bengals\"&gt;Cincinnati Bengals&lt;/a&gt; and the former &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Stingers\"&gt;Cincinnati Stingers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Hockey%20Association\"&gt;World Hockey Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeWitt was part owner of &lt;a href=\"Riverfront%20Coliseum\"&gt;Riverfront Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; in Cincinnati on December 3, 1979 &lt;a href=\"The%20Who%20concert%20disaster\"&gt;when 11 people were killed prior to a concert by The Who&lt;/a&gt;. \nSt. Louis Cardinals (1995\u2013present).\nIn 1995, DeWitt, with Stephen and Frederick Brauer, purchased the St. Louis Cardinals from &lt;a href=\"Anheuser-Busch\"&gt;Anheuser-Busch&lt;/a&gt; for $150 million. He oversees all league, financial, operational and baseball affairs for the club. Since DeWitt bought the team, the Cardinals have won two &lt;a href=\"World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"2006%20World%20Series\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2011%20World%20Series\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;), four &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20National%20League%20pennant%20winners\"&gt;National League pennants&lt;/a&gt;, and 11 &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20Central\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; titles, and have made 15 total &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason\"&gt;playoff&lt;/a&gt; appearances. \"&lt;a href=\"Forbes\"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;\" estimated that the team was worth $1.4 billion in 2014 and $2.1 billion in July 2019. The Cardinals are one of the largest privately held firms in St. Louis, bringing in an estimated $233 million in revenue in 2012.\nIn 1997, DeWitt established Cardinals Care, a &lt;a href=\"nonprofit%20organization\"&gt;nonprofit organization&lt;/a&gt; that builds baseball fields, helps youth baseball programs, and awards &lt;a href=\"Grant%20%28money%29\"&gt;grants&lt;/a&gt; to children's boards. Through January 2017, Cardinals Care had distributed some $900,000 a year. As of 2013, the organization has built 18 baseball fields in the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20St.%20Louis\"&gt;Greater St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; area. Since 2004, the organization has run Redbird Rookies, a network of 20 leagues for nearly 4,500 children around Greater St. Louis and in rural sections of &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. who would not otherwise have the opportunity. It provides equipment and other necessities to the players, training for coaches and organizers, and workshops for parents. \nThe Cardinals have purchased three of their minor league affiliates since the DeWitt group took over. In 1998, DeWitt purchased the &lt;a href=\"Palm%20Beach%20Cardinals\"&gt;Palm Beach Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20League\"&gt;Florida State League&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"minor%20league\"&gt;minor league&lt;/a&gt; A-ball) and, in 2005, the &lt;a href=\"Springfield%20Cardinals\"&gt;Springfield Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20League\"&gt;Texas League&lt;/a&gt; (AA). As of April 2013, the team negotiated to purchase the &lt;a href=\"Memphis%20Redbirds\"&gt;Memphis Redbirds&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20League\"&gt;Pacific Coast League&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Triple-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;AAA&lt;/a&gt;) from the Memphis Redbirds Foundation (MRF), a local non-profit entity. However, talks went on hold due to &lt;a href=\"Default%20%28finance%29\"&gt;defaulted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt; on the building of &lt;a href=\"AutoZone%20Park\"&gt;AutoZone Park&lt;/a&gt;. On November 16, 2013, the Cardinals announced a resolution to purchase the team while the city purchased the stadium. The Cardinals agreed to lease the stadium from the city while Memphis will upgrade the park. In 2013, \"Forbes\" listed the Redbirds as one of the ten most valuable minor league franchises.\nTo expand the Cardinals' international presence, DeWitt opened baseball academies in the &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Republic\"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt; and placed representatives in six foreign countries.\nIn 2006, the Cardinals moved from their old home, &lt;a href=\"Busch%20Memorial%20Stadium\"&gt;Busch Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Busch%20Stadium\"&gt;Busch Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2006%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. The $365 million stadium is one of the few majority-privately funded MLB stadiums, along with the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Park\"&gt;Oracle Park&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Dodger%20Stadium\"&gt;Dodger Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Busch Stadium cost $45 million (12%) in a long-term loan from &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20County%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;St. Louis County&lt;/a&gt;, while, by comparison the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Brewers\"&gt;Milwaukee Brewers&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"American%20Family%20Field\"&gt;American Family Field&lt;/a&gt; ended up drawing 77.5% in &lt;a href=\"Government%20spending\"&gt;public funding&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn conjunction with opening the new Busch Stadium, a mixed-use retail, entertainment, hotel, residential and office space known as &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Ballpark%20Village\"&gt;Ballpark Village&lt;/a&gt; was planned for development adjacent to Busch Stadium. However, several years of delays postponed the groundbreaking and construction until spring of 2013.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2009%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;, the Cardinals hosted the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeWitt began emphasizing developing talent as much as possible through the &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;minor leagues&lt;/a&gt;, rather than relying mainly on &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt;s. Seventeen of the 25 players on the Cardinals' 2011 World Series roster were Cardinals' draftees.\nIn January &lt;a href=\"2014%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Memphis cleared the Cardinals to purchase the Memphis Redbirds from the MRF. Ballpark Village construction was completed and it opened in March 2014. The Cardinals also announced the rechristening of the team &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Museum\"&gt;Hall of Fame Museum&lt;/a&gt; with an annual selection process selection commencing in 2015. Twenty-two former Cardinals players and personnel were announced for induction into the Hall of Fame for the inaugural class of 2014. Closed since 2008 when the &lt;a href=\"International%20Bowling%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;International Bowling Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; moved to &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, this reincarnation of the museum is located in the newly constructed Ballpark Village within the same building as the &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Nation\"&gt;Cardinal Nation&lt;/a&gt; Restaurant.\nThe Cardinals' value exceeded $1 billion for the first time in 2015 when \"&lt;a href=\"Forbes\"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;\" appraised the Cardinals outright at $1.4 billion, making them the 27th-most valuable sports franchise in the world, and sixth-principal &lt;a href=\"Professional%20sports%20league%20organization\"&gt;franchise&lt;/a&gt; in Major League Baseball (MLB). It was an increase from an $800 million pricing and eighth in the echelon in &lt;a href=\"2014%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;. Their revenue was $294 million while their operating income was $73.6 million, and their overall assessment was approximately $200 million higher than the MLB average of $1.2 billion. Mike Ozanian of \"Forbes\" remarked that the Cardinals were \"baseball's biggest anomaly\", with outsize value outpacing their status as one of baseball's \"smallest &lt;a href=\"Market%20%28economics%29\"&gt;markets&lt;/a&gt;\", and Ballpark Village was a popular destination for &lt;a href=\"Eating\"&gt;dining&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"entertainment\"&gt;entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. The Cardinals' local &lt;a href=\"Television%20program\"&gt;television&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Audience%20measurement\"&gt;ratings&lt;/a&gt; (7.76) graded the highest among all &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20regional%20sports%20networks\"&gt;major league teams&lt;/a&gt;.\nReports surfaced on June 16, &lt;a href=\"2015%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, that the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (FBI) were reviewing an alleged incident involving Cardinals' front office officials &lt;a href=\"Hacker%20%28computer%20security%29\"&gt;hacking&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;' database of players, scouting reports and proprietary statistics. It was regarded as the first known case of &lt;a href=\"Corporation\"&gt;corporate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"espionage\"&gt;espionage&lt;/a&gt; involving &lt;a href=\"computer%20network\"&gt;computer network&lt;/a&gt; hacking in &lt;a href=\"professional%20sports\"&gt;professional sports&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn September 19, 2015, the Cardinals became the first team in MLB to clinch a playoff spot that &lt;a href=\"2015%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;. It also extended a franchise record of five consecutive seasons of reaching the postseason, a record which the club had set in &lt;a href=\"2014%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical activities.\nIn 2003, President &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; appointed DeWitt to be on the &lt;a href=\"President%27s%20Intelligence%20Advisory%20Board\"&gt;President's Intelligence Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt; and tapped his wife, Kathy, to serve on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Arts\"&gt;National Endowment for the Arts&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nDeWitt and his wife, Katharine \"Kathy\" Cramer DeWitt, live in &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Hill%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Indian Hill, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. They have four children, Katie, Bill, Andrew, and Margot and twelve grandchildren. &lt;a href=\"Bill%20DeWitt%20III\"&gt;Bill DeWitt III&lt;/a&gt; is the President of the Cardinals. Andrew E. DeWitt is the founder and CEO of Dewey's Pizza."
