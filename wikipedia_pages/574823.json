    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"political%20science\"&gt;political science&lt;/a&gt;, legitimacy is the &lt;a href=\"Rights\"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt; and acceptance of an &lt;a href=\"authority\"&gt;authority&lt;/a&gt;, usually a governing law or a &lt;a href=\"regime\"&gt;regime&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas \"authority\" denotes a specific position in an established government, the term \"legitimacy\" denotes a system of government\u2014wherein \"government\" denotes \"&lt;a href=\"sphere%20of%20influence\"&gt;sphere of influence&lt;/a&gt;\". An authority viewed as legitimate often has the right and justification to exercise &lt;a href=\"Power%20%28social%20and%20political%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;. Political legitimacy is considered a basic condition for governing, without which a government will suffer legislative deadlock(s) and collapse. In political systems where this is not the case, unpopular r\u00e9gimes survive because they are considered legitimate by a small, influential &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;\u00e9lite&lt;/a&gt;. In Chinese political philosophy, since the historical period of the &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Dynasty\"&gt;Zhou Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (1046\u2013256 BC), the political legitimacy of a ruler and government was derived from the &lt;a href=\"Mandate%20of%20Heaven\"&gt;Mandate of Heaven&lt;/a&gt;, and unjust rulers who lost said mandate therefore lost the right to rule the people.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ethics\"&gt;moral philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, the term \"legitimacy\" is often positively interpreted as the &lt;a href=\"Norm%20%28philosophy%29\"&gt;normative&lt;/a&gt; status conferred by a governed people upon their governors' institutions, offices, and actions, based upon the belief that their government's actions are appropriate uses of power by a legally constituted government.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;-era British social philosopher &lt;a href=\"John%20Locke\"&gt;John Locke&lt;/a&gt; (1632\u20131704) said that political legitimacy derives from popular explicit and implicit &lt;a href=\"consent%20of%20the%20governed\"&gt;consent of the governed&lt;/a&gt;: \"The argument of the [\"Second\"] \"Treatise\" is that the government is not legitimate unless it is carried on with the consent of the governed.\" The German &lt;a href=\"Political%20philosophy\"&gt;political philosopher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dolf%20Sternberger\"&gt;Dolf Sternberger&lt;/a&gt; said that \"[l]egitimacy is the foundation of such governmental power as is exercised, both with a consciousness on the government's part that it has a right to govern, and with some recognition by the governed of that right\". The American &lt;a href=\"political%20sociologist\"&gt;political sociologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Seymour%20Martin%20Lipset\"&gt;Seymour Martin Lipset&lt;/a&gt; said that legitimacy also \"involves the capacity of a political system to engender and maintain the belief that existing political institutions are the most appropriate and proper ones for the society\". The American political scientist &lt;a href=\"Robert%20A.%20Dahl\"&gt;Robert A. Dahl&lt;/a&gt; explained legitimacy as a reservoir: so long as the water is at a given level, political stability is maintained, if it falls below the required level, political legitimacy is endangered.\nTypes.\nLegitimacy is \"a value whereby something or someone is recognized and accepted as right and proper\". In political science, legitimacy usually is understood as the popular acceptance and recognition by the public of the authority of a governing r\u00e9gime, whereby authority has political power through consent and mutual understandings, not coercion. The three types of political legitimacy described by German &lt;a href=\"sociologist\"&gt;sociologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Max%20Weber\"&gt;Max Weber&lt;/a&gt; are traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal:\nForms.\nNuminous legitimacy.\nIn a &lt;a href=\"theocracy\"&gt;theocracy&lt;/a&gt;, government legitimacy derives from the spiritual authority of a god or a goddess.\nCivil legitimacy.\nThe political legitimacy of a civil government derives from agreement among the autonomous constituent institutions\u2014legislative, judicial, executive\u2014combined for the national common good. One way civil society grants legitimacy to governments is through public elections. There are also those who refute the legitimacy offered by public elections, pointing out that the amount of legitimacy public elections can grant depends significantly on the electoral system conducting the elections. In the United States, this issue has surfaced around how voting is impacted by &lt;a href=\"gerrymandering\"&gt;gerrymandering&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Electoral%20College\"&gt;United States Electoral College&lt;/a&gt;'s ability to produce winners by minority rule and discouragement of voter turnout outside of &lt;a href=\"Swing%20state\"&gt;Swing state&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Shelby%20County%20v.%20Holder\"&gt;repeal of part of the Voting Rights Act&lt;/a&gt; in 2013. Another challenge to the political legitimacy offered by elections is whether or not marginalized groups such as women or those who are incarcerated are allowed to vote.\nCivil legitimacy can be granted through different measures for accountability than voting, such as financial transparency and stake-holder accountability. In the international system another method for measuring civil legitimacy is through accountability to international human rights norms.\nIn an effort to determine what makes a government legitimate, the Center for Public Impact launched a project to hold a global conversation about legitimacy stating, inviting citizens, academics and governments to participate. The organization also publishes case studies that consider the theme of legitimacy as it applies to projects in a number of different countries including Bristol, Lebanon and Canada.\n\"Good\" governance vs \"bad\" governance.\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commission (OHCHR) established standards of what is considered \"good governance\" that include the key attributes transparency, responsibility, accountability, participation and responsiveness (to the needs of the people).\nInput, output and throughput legitimacy.\nAssessing the political legitimacy of a government can be done by looking at three different aspects of which a government can derive legitimacy. &lt;a href=\"Fritz%20W.%20Scharpf\"&gt;Fritz Scharpf&lt;/a&gt; introduced two normative criteria, which are output legitimacy, i.e. the effectiveness of policy outcomes for people and input legitimacy, the responsiveness to citizen concerns as a result of participation by the people. A third normative criterion was added by &lt;a href=\"Vivien%20A.%20Schmidt\"&gt;Vivien Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, who analyzes legitimacy also in terms of what she calls throughput, i.e. the governance processes that happen in between input and output.\nNegative and positive legitimacy.\nAbulof distinguishes between negative political legitimacy (NPL), which is about the object of legitimation (answering \"what\" is legitimate), and positive political legitimacy (PPL), which is about the source of legitimation (answering \"who\" is the 'legitimator'). NPL is concerned with establishing where to draw the line between good and bad; PPL with who should be drawing it in the first place. From the NPL perspective, political legitimacy emanates from appropriate actions; from a PPL perspective, it emanates from appropriate actors. In the social contract tradition, Hobbes and Locke focused on NPL (stressing security and liberty, respectively), while Rousseau focused more on PPL (\"the people\" as the legitimator). Arguably, political stability depends on both forms of legitimacy.\nInstrumental and substantive legitimacy.\nWeber's understanding of legitimacy rests on shared \"values\", such as tradition and rational-legality. But policies that aim at (re-)constructing legitimacy by improving the service delivery or 'output' of a state often only respond to shared \"needs\". Therefore, substantive sources of legitimacy need to be distinguished from more instrumental ones. \"Instrumental legitimacy\" rests on \"the rational assessment of the usefulness of an authority ..., describing to what extent an authority responds to shared needs. Instrumental legitimacy is very much based on the perceived effectiveness of service delivery. Conversely, \"substantive legitimacy\" is a more abstract normative judgment, which is underpinned by shared values. If a person believes that an entity has the right to exercise social control, he or she may also accept personal disadvantages.\"\nPerceived legitimacy.\nEstablishing legitimacy is not simply transactional; service provision, elections and rule of law do not automatically grant legitimacy. State legitimacy rests on citizens\u2019 perceptions and expectations of the state, and these are co-constructed between state actors and citizens. What legitimizes a state is also contextually specific. McCullough et al. (2020) show that in different countries, provision of different services build state legitimacy. In Nepal public water provision was most associated with state legitimacy, while in Pakistan it was health services.\nFoundational and contingent legitimacy.\nPolitical theorist Ross Mittiga has proposed an alternative typology, consisting of two parts: foundational and contingent legitimacy. According to Mittiga, foundational legitimacy (FL) \"pertains to a government\u2019s ability to ensure the safety and security of its citizens,\" while contingent legitimacy (CL) obtains in situations in which governments \"exercise[] power in acceptable ways.\"\nMittiga specifies further that FL:...is bound up with a range of political capacities and actions including, among other things, being able to ensure continuous access to essential goods (particularly food, water, and shelter), prevent avoidable catastrophes, provide immediate and effective disaster relief, and combat invading forces or quell unjustified uprisings or rebellions. If a government cannot fulfill these basic security functions, it is not legitimate, if it is even a government at all. [p.3]On the other hand, Mittiga acknowledges that there is \"extensive debate\" about which factors are relevant to CL, but argues that, \"[a]mong the most commonly defended factors\" are \"the presence of democratic rights and processes, consent, guarantees of equal representation, provision of core public benefits, protection of basic individual rights and freedoms, social justice, and observance of fairness principles.\" [pp.\u00a04\u20135] Mittiga specifies further that \"[m]ost contemporary theorists maintain that legitimacy [in the contingent sense] requires multiple of these factors\u2014some of which are procedural and others substantive.\"\nAccording to Mittiga, what makes certain aspects of legitimacy \"contingent\" (as opposed to \"foundational\") is that they are affected by (1) \"the problem of pluralism\"\u2014i.e., the idea that \"any firm agreement on\" which factor(s) matters (or matter most of all) \"will remain elusive or at least always open to contestation and renegotiation\"; (2) \"the problem of partial displacement,\" which holds that \"when new legitimation factors emerge,\" as they often have historically, \"earlier ones may not entirely disappear but only become less salient, at least for sizable portions of the citizenry\"; and (3) \"the problem of exceptional circumstances,\" which is \"the fact that even widely shared and seemingly stable CL factors are routinely relaxed or abandoned during emergencies, often without calling into question the basic legitimacy of the government.\"\nMittiga summarizes the difference between these two types or levels or types of legitimacy as follows:The factors associated with CL condition the use of political power by specifying, for instance, what can or cannot be done or sacrificed, how decisions should be made, and who counts (and for how much). The answers to these questions often appear to us as moral universals; yet, in practice, they are the products of long and contentious historical processes. FL, on the other hand, does not vary between societies, generations, or circumstances. Ensuring safety and security is always the \"primary\"\u2014though, in good states, under reasonably favorable conditions, not the \"exclusive\"\u2014end of political power.\nAristotle expresses something like this in insisting that the point of political society is to furnish the resources needed not just to live but to live \"well\". Crudely put, FL is about living, CL about living well. And it is of course impossible to live well without living: after all, there can be no democracy of desolation, no fair social cooperation in conditions of extreme scarcity, no real rights when political stability is maintainable only through raw assertions of coercive power (if it can be maintained at all). In this sense, FL is \"necessarily\" prior to CL, and must be regarded as such in moments when trade-offs become a necessary part of the political calculus. [p.7]\nSources.\nMax Weber proposed that societies behave cyclically in governing themselves with different types of governmental legitimacy. That &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt; was unnecessary for establishing legitimacy, a condition that can be established with codified laws, customs, and cultural principles, not by means of &lt;a href=\"voting\"&gt;popular suffrage&lt;/a&gt;. That a society might decide to revert from the legitimate government of a rational\u2013legal authority to the charismatic government of a leader; e.g., the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fascism\"&gt;Fascist&lt;/a&gt; Italy under &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Mussolini\"&gt;Benito Mussolini&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Francoist%20Spain\"&gt;Francoist Spain&lt;/a&gt; under General &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Franco\"&gt;Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe French political scientist &lt;a href=\"Mattei%20Dogan\"&gt;Mattei Dogan&lt;/a&gt;'s contemporary interpretation of Weber's types of political legitimacy (traditional, charismatic, legal-rational) proposes that they are conceptually insufficient to comprehend the complex relationships that constitute a legitimate political system in the 21st century. Moreover, Dogan proposed that traditional authority and charismatic authority are obsolete as forms of contemporary government; e.g., the Islamic Republic of Iran (est. 1979) rule by means of the priestly Koranic interpretations by the &lt;a href=\"Ayatollah\"&gt;Ayatollah&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ruhollah%20Khomeini\"&gt;Ruhollah Khomeini&lt;/a&gt;. That traditional authority has disappeared in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;; that the rule-proving exceptions are &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20Republic%20of%20Iran\"&gt;Islamic Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the third Weber type of political legitimacy, rational-legal authority, exists in so many permutations no longer allow it to be limited as a type of legitimate authority.\nForms of legitimate government.\nIn determining the political legitimacy of a system of rule and government, the term proper\u2014\"political legitimacy\"\u2014is philosophically an &lt;a href=\"essentially%20contested%20concept\"&gt;essentially contested concept&lt;/a&gt; that facilitates understanding the different applications and interpretations of abstract, &lt;a href=\"Qualitative%20properties\"&gt;qualitative&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Evaluation\"&gt;evaluative&lt;/a&gt; concepts such as \"&lt;a href=\"art\"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"social%20justice\"&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt;\", et cetera, as applied in &lt;a href=\"aesthetics\"&gt;aesthetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"political%20philosophy\"&gt;political philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"philosophy%20of%20history\"&gt;philosophy of history&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"philosophy%20of%20religion\"&gt;philosophy of religion&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, in defining the political legitimacy of a system of government and rule, the term \"essentially contested concept\" indicates that a key term (&lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"constitutionalism\"&gt;constitutionalism&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) has different meanings within a given political argument. Hence, the intellectually restrictive politics of &lt;a href=\"Dogma%23Dogma%20outside%20of%20religion\"&gt;dogmatism&lt;/a&gt; (\"My answer is right, and all others are wrong\"), &lt;a href=\"scepticism\"&gt;scepticism&lt;/a&gt; (\"I don't know what is true, and I even doubt my own opinion\"), and &lt;a href=\"eclecticism\"&gt;eclecticism&lt;/a&gt; (\"Each meaning gives a partial view, so the more meanings the better\") are inappropriate philosophic stances for managing a political term that has more than one meaning (see &lt;a href=\"W.%20B.%20Gallie\"&gt;Walter Bryce Gallie&lt;/a&gt;).\nEstablishing what qualifies as a legitimate form of government continues to be a topic of great philosophical controversy. Forms of legitimate government are posited to include:"
