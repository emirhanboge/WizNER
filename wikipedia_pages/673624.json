    "text": "The Australian Aboriginal Flag represents &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Australians\"&gt;Aboriginal Australians&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the officially proclaimed &lt;a href=\"flags%20of%20Australia\"&gt;flags of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, by which it has special legal and political status together with the &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Australia\"&gt;national flag&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Flag\"&gt;Torres Strait Islander Flag&lt;/a&gt;, with which it is often flown.\nThe flag was designed in 1971 by &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Thomas%20%28activist%29\"&gt;Harold Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, an Aboriginal artist who is descended from the &lt;a href=\"Luritja\"&gt;Luritja&lt;/a&gt; people of Central Australia. Thomas held the intellectual property rights to the flag's design until January 2022, when he transferred the copyright to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Government\"&gt;Commonwealth government&lt;/a&gt;. The flag was designed for the &lt;a href=\"Native%20title\"&gt;land rights&lt;/a&gt; movement and became a symbol of Aboriginal people of Australia.\nThe flag is horizontally and equally divided into a black region (above) and a red region (below); a yellow disc is superimposed over the centre of the flag. The overall proportions of the flag, as proclaimed, are 2:3; however, the flag is often reproduced in the proportions 1:2 as with the Australian National Flag.\nStatus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Government of Australia&lt;/a&gt; granted it \"Flag of Australia\" status, under the &lt;a href=\"Flags%20Act%201953\"&gt;Flags Act 1953&lt;/a&gt;, by proclamation on 14 July 1995.\nDue to an \"administrative oversight\", the 1995 proclamation was not lodged so that it would continue in force indefinitely; hence it automatically expired on 1 January 2008. It was therefore almost identically replaced, on 25 January 2008, with effect as from 1 January.\nIn the 2008 proclamation, the flag \"is recognised as the flag of the Aboriginal peoples of Australia and a flag of significance to the Australian nation generally\" and appointed \"to be the flag of the Aboriginal peoples of Australia and to be known as the Australian Aboriginal Flag\". The design is reproduced in Schedule 1 and described in Schedule 2.\nDesign.\nSymbolic meaning.\nThe symbolic meaning of the flag colours (as stated by Harold Thomas) is:\nColours.\nThe official colour specifications of the Australian Aboriginal Flag are:\nIn most cases, on-screen or digital reproductions of the flag should use the RGB colours as in the table above. When displaying in physical fabric formats, it is much preferred to use the &lt;a href=\"Pantone\"&gt;Pantone&lt;/a&gt; specifications. When printing on paper, the &lt;a href=\"CMYK%20color%20model\"&gt;CMYK&lt;/a&gt; colours are superior.\nHistory.\nThe flag was first flown on &lt;a href=\"NAIDOC%20Week\"&gt;National Aborigines Day&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Square%2C%20Adelaide\"&gt;Victoria Square&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; on 9 July 1971. It was also used in &lt;a href=\"Canberra\"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Tent%20Embassy\"&gt;Aboriginal Tent Embassy&lt;/a&gt; from late 1972. In the early months of the embassy\u2014which was established in February that year\u2014other designs were used, including a black, green and red flag made by supporters of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Sydney%20Rabbitohs\"&gt;South Sydney Rabbitohs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; club, and a flag with a red-black field containing a spear and four crescents in yellow.\n&lt;a href=\"Cathy%20Freeman\"&gt;Cathy Freeman&lt;/a&gt; caused controversy at the &lt;a href=\"1994%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;1994 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt; by carrying the Aboriginal flag as well as the &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Australian national flag&lt;/a&gt; during her &lt;a href=\"victory%20lap\"&gt;victory lap&lt;/a&gt; of the arena, after winning the 200 metres sprint; only the national flag is meant to be displayed. Despite strong criticism from both Games officials and Australian team president &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Tunstall\"&gt;Arthur Tunstall&lt;/a&gt;, Freeman carried both flags again after winning the 400 metres.\nThe decision in 1995 by Labor Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Keating\"&gt;Paul Keating&lt;/a&gt; that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags should be given the status of national flags was opposed by the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; Opposition at the time, Opposition Leader &lt;a href=\"John%20Howard\"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; stating that \"any attempt to give the flags official status under the Flags Act would rightly be seen by many in the community not as an act of reconciliation but as a divisive gesture\". Nonetheless, since Howard became Prime Minister in 1996 and under subsequent Labor governments, these flags have remained national flags. However, this decision was differently criticised by the designer of the flag, Harold Thomas, who said that the Aboriginal flag \"doesn't need any more recognition\".\nThe National Indigenous Advisory Committee campaigned for the Aboriginal flag to be flown at &lt;a href=\"Stadium%20Australia\"&gt;Stadium Australia&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2000 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Organising%20Committee%20for%20the%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympics organisers&lt;/a&gt; announced that the Aboriginal flag would be flown at Olympic venues. The flag has been flown over the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Harbour%20Bridge\"&gt;Sydney Harbour Bridge&lt;/a&gt; during the march for &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Areconciliation\"&gt;reconciliation&lt;/a&gt; of 2000 and many other events, including &lt;a href=\"Australia%20Day\"&gt;Australia Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the 30th anniversary of the flag in 2001, thousands of people were involved in a ceremony where the flag was carried from the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Parliament of South Australia&lt;/a&gt; to Victoria Square.\nUse.\nPublic buildings and locations.\nThe first city council to fly the Aboriginal flag was &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20City%20Council%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Newcastle City Council&lt;/a&gt; in 1977. The &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Trades%20Hall\"&gt;Melbourne Trades Hall&lt;/a&gt; is one of many other buildings throughout Australia that fly the flag. \nOn 8 July 2002 the &lt;a href=\"Adelaide%20City%20Council\"&gt;Adelaide City Council&lt;/a&gt; endorsed the permanent flying of the Aboriginal flag close to the location of its first raising at Victoria Square in 1971 (now dual-named Tarntanyangga), which now flies adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Australian flag&lt;/a&gt;. It has also been flown in front of &lt;a href=\"Adelaide%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Adelaide Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; since the same date.\nVarious councils in Australian towns fly the Aboriginal flag from the town halls, such as &lt;a href=\"Bendigo%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Bendigo&lt;/a&gt; (adopted in 2005). The flag is also flown at many other public buildings such as a number of the state Parliament Houses including that of Victoria.\nIn April 2021 Regional NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said that he would like to see the flag flown at every &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Police\"&gt;New South Wales Police&lt;/a&gt; regional police station in the state, expanding from the 12 of the 89 then flying it.\nThe Australian Aboriginal Flag has been hoisted alongside the Australian National Flag as a permanent feature of the Australian Embassy in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, Ireland, since 5 March 2021.\nOther authorised uses.\nThe sale of &lt;a href=\"condom\"&gt;condom&lt;/a&gt;s in the colours of the Aboriginal flag won a public health award in 2005 for the initiative's success in improving safe sex practices among young Indigenous people.\nAboriginal-designed &lt;a href=\"emoji\"&gt;emoji&lt;/a&gt;s titled Indigemojis and including the flag on several designs, were released in December 2019 via an app, with the permission of Harold Thomas.\nProposed, unauthorised and other uses.\nThe Aboriginal flag is sometimes substituted for the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Flag\"&gt;Union Flag&lt;/a&gt; in the canton of Australia's flag in &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20proposed%20Australian%20flags\"&gt;proposed new Australian flag designs&lt;/a&gt;. Harold Thomas said of this idea: \"I wouldn\u2032t reject it out of hand, but I could make a decision to say no. Our flag is not a secondary thing. It stands on its own, not to be placed as an adjunct to any other thing. It shouldn't be treated that way\".\nIn the &lt;a href=\"science%20fiction%20film\"&gt;science fiction film&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Event%20Horizon%20%28film%29\"&gt;Event Horizon&lt;/a&gt;\", actor &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Neill\"&gt;Sam Neill&lt;/a&gt;, himself a New Zealander, designed a flag for use on his sleeve as the way he thought the Australian flag should look in 2047, which incorporated the Aboriginal flag. \nThe Australian Aboriginal Flag is celebrated in the painting \"&lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Supper\"&gt;The First Supper&lt;/a&gt;\" (1988) by &lt;a href=\"Susan%20Dorothea%20White\"&gt;Susan Dorothea White&lt;/a&gt; where the central figure is an Aboriginal woman who displays the flag on her T-shirt.\nThe Australian Aboriginal Flag is the default flag in the web game \"&lt;a href=\"NationStates\"&gt;NationStates&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe flag was to be part of the logo on Google Australia's home page on &lt;a href=\"Australia%20Day\"&gt;Australia Day&lt;/a&gt; 2010, but the company was forced to modify the design due to its creator Harold Thomas demanding payment if Google were to use it.\nThe anti-Islamic group &lt;a href=\"Reclaim%20Australia\"&gt;Reclaim Australia&lt;/a&gt; used the flag at their protests in 2015, which was condemned by the flag's creator, Harold Thomas, who called it \"idiotic\".\nCopyright.\nCopyright in the flag has been subject to controversy, as to original ownership of the copyright and as to current ownership.\nIn 1997, in the case of \"Thomas v Brown and Tennant\", the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Court%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Federal Court of Australia&lt;/a&gt; declared that Harold Thomas was the owner of copyright in the design of the Australian Aboriginal flag, and thus the flag has protection under &lt;a href=\"Australian%20copyright%20law\"&gt;Australian copyright law&lt;/a&gt;. Thomas had sought legal recognition of his ownership and compensation following the Federal Government's 1995 proclamation of the design. His claim was contested by two others, George Brown and James Tennant. Thomas awarded rights solely to Carroll &amp; Richardson \u2013 Flagworld Pty Ltd and Birubi Art Pty Ltd for the manufacture and marketing of the flag and of products featuring the flag's image. \nIn November 2018, Thomas granted &lt;a href=\"WAM%20Clothing\"&gt;WAM Clothing&lt;/a&gt; (which is co-owned by Birubi Art owner Ben Wooster) a licence for the use of the flag on clothing. In June 2019, it was reported that WAM Clothing had demanded that Aboriginal-owned businesses stop selling clothing that featured the flag. They also sent notices to the &lt;a href=\"NRL\"&gt;NRL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Football%20League\"&gt;AFL&lt;/a&gt; about their use of the flag on &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20round\"&gt;Indigenous round&lt;/a&gt; jerseys.\nIn June 2020, after a prominent Aboriginal footballer began selling WAM-licensed teeshirts bearing the flag through his own website, Aboriginal former senator &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Peris\"&gt;Nova Peris&lt;/a&gt;, a leader of a \"free the flag\" campaign, wrote to the &lt;a href=\"Governor-General%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt;, requesting his support for divesting WAM of the copyright.\nAfter consultation with its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Council, the AFL did not enter into a commercial agreement with WAM in 2020, in line with general Aboriginal sentiment on the issue. In August 2020, &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Wyatt\"&gt;Ken Wyatt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minister%20for%20Indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;Minister for Indigenous Australians&lt;/a&gt;, said that he would love to see the flag freely used across Australia, and former AFL player &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Long%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Michael Long&lt;/a&gt; said its absence would have a negative effect on the players in the &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Doug%20Nicholls%20Indigenous%20Round\"&gt;Sir Doug Nicholls Indigenous Round&lt;/a&gt;. Wyatt encouraged spectators to bring flags to the games, beginning in &lt;a href=\"Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory\"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; on 22 August 2020.\nOn 24 January 2022, the Commonwealth government announced that, after more than two years of confidential negotiations, Thomas had transferred the copyright to the flag to the Commonwealth. The federal government paid $20.05 million to Thomas and licence holders (including WAM Clothing and Carroll and Richardson Flagworld) to extinguish existing licences and secure copyright. As part of the copyright transfer, Thomas retained moral rights over the flag (which include the right to be identified as its creator). Following the copyright transfer, Carroll and Richardson Flagworld will continue to be the exclusive manufacturer, although individuals may make copies for personal use. The Commonwealth agreed to fund a scholarship in Thomas's name for Indigenous students to further the development of Indigenous governance and leadership and an online education portal on the flag's history. An original painting by Thomas detailing the transfer of copyright will be \"displayed in a prominent location\" by the Commonwealth. All royalties from the copyright are to be transferred to the &lt;a href=\"NAIDOC%20Week\"&gt;National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee&lt;/a&gt; and $2 million will be devoted to establishing a not-for-profit organisation that will make periodic payments for activities related to the flag.\nThere is confusion, however, about how \"free\" the flag has become. Immediately after the agreement was announced, the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" understood it to mean that:\nCarroll and Richardson Flagworld has objected that, in media reports, \"free\" has been over-interpreted. \u201cAll is not what it appears\u201d, said its managing director, Wayne Gregory: \nOther legal questions remain, for as long as details of the agreement remain commercial-in-confidence. An Aboriginal objection has been that to \"free\" the flag for all and sundry may demean it as a symbol of Aboriginal identity and history."
