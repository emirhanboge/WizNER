Both nations view their counterpart as strategic partners in each other's regions; Indonesia in &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt; and Mexico in &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;. Both nations are mutual members of the &lt;a href=\"Asia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation\"&gt;Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forum%20of%20East%20Asia-Latin%20America%20Cooperation\"&gt;Forum of East Asia-Latin America Cooperation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Group%20of%2015\"&gt;Group of 15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"G-20%20major%20economies\"&gt;G-20 major economies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MIKTA\"&gt;MIKTA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"World%20Trade%20Organization\"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe first contact between both nations would have taken place with the &lt;a href=\"Manila%20galleon\"&gt;Manila\u2011Acapulco Galleon&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Acapulco\"&gt;Acapulco&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico and &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; (capital of the Spanish crown in the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;). The Spanish traded with the Dutch and Portuguese ports in South-East Asia, and returned to Mexico with goods (and people) from the region. In August 1945, Indonesia obtained its independence from the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. On 6 April 1953, Indonesia and Mexico established diplomatic relations. Soon afterwards, the Mexican ambassador resident in &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; was accredited to Indonesia. It was not until 1961 that Mexico named a resident ambassador to Indonesia. In 1959, President &lt;a href=\"Sukarno\"&gt;Sukarno&lt;/a&gt; became the first Indonesian head-of-state to visit Mexico. In 1962, Mexican President &lt;a href=\"Adolfo%20L%C3%B3pez%20Mateos\"&gt;Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos&lt;/a&gt; paid an official visit to Indonesia.\nIndonesian President &lt;a href=\"Susilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono\"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt; paid an official visit to Mexico in 2008 and again in 2012 to attend the APEC summit in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Cabos\"&gt;Los Cabos&lt;/a&gt;. During his 2008 visit, President Yudhoyono signed a number of agreements in education, agriculture, promotion of trade and in energy cooperation. In May 2013, Indonesian Foreign Affair Minister &lt;a href=\"Marty%20Natalegawa\"&gt;Marty Natalegawa&lt;/a&gt; paid a visit to Mexico to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Indonesia-Mexico diplomatic relations. To commemorate this event, the Mexican and Indonesian Post Office issued a joint stamp illustrating animals as the symbol of both nations; the Mexican Jaguar (\"&lt;a href=\"Jaguar\"&gt;Panthera onca hernandesii&lt;/a&gt;\") and Indonesian Clouded Leopard (\"&lt;a href=\"Neofelis%20diardi\"&gt;Neofelis diardi&lt;/a&gt;\").\nIn 2013, Mexican President &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20Pe%C3%B1a%20Nieto\"&gt;Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto&lt;/a&gt; paid a visit to &lt;a href=\"Bali\"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; to attend the APEC summit.\nHigh-level visits.\nHigh-level visits from Indonesia to Mexico\nHigh-level visits from Mexico to Indonesia\nBilateral agreements.\nBoth nations have signed several bilateral agreements, such as an Agreement on the establishment of trade between Indonesia and Mexico (1961); Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation (1998); Agreement on Educational and Cultural Cooperation (2001); Memorandum on the establishment of mutual bilateral consultations between both nations (2001); Agreement on the Avoidance of Double-Taxation and Tax Evasion (2004); Agreement of Cooperation in Combating Drug Trafficking, Psychotropic Substances and Chemical Precursors (2011); Memorandum of Understanding in Combating Transnational Crimes and Capacity Development (2011); Agreement on Air Transportation Services (2013); Memorandum of Understanding in Health and Tourism Cooperation (2013) and a Memorandum of Understanding in Export Credit Cooperation between &lt;a href=\"Bancomext\"&gt;Bancomext&lt;/a&gt; and Eximbank of Indonesia (2013).

Mexican multinational company, &lt;a href=\"KidZania\"&gt;KidZania&lt;/a&gt; operates in Indonesia. As part of the Asia-Pacific region, Indonesia is one of Mexico's main economic diversification targets. On the other hand, Indonesia also views Mexico as an important non-traditional trading partner in the Latin American region.\nCultural and educational.\nThe Government of Mexico offers the SRE (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) Postgraduate Scholarship for Indonesians who want to study a postgraduate in Mexico.
