    "text": "Gordon Bernie Kaufmann (19 March 1888\u00a0\u2013 1 March 1949) was an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English-born&lt;/a&gt; American architect mostly known for his work on the &lt;a href=\"Hoover%20Dam\"&gt;Hoover Dam&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nOn 19 March 1888, Kaufmann was born in &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hill%2C%20London\"&gt;Forest Hill&lt;/a&gt;, London, England.\nEducation.\nKaufmann attended &lt;a href=\"Whitgift%20School\"&gt;Whitgift School&lt;/a&gt; in south &lt;a href=\"Croydon\"&gt;Croydon&lt;/a&gt;, and went on to graduate from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Westminster\"&gt;London Polytechnic Institute&lt;/a&gt;, circa 1908. Kaufmann then moved to &lt;a href=\"Vancouver\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, where he spent the next six years.\nCareer.\nDuring Kaufmann's early career, he did much work in the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Mediterranean Revival Style&lt;/a&gt;, which had become popular at that time. He was also the initial architect for &lt;a href=\"Scripps%20College\"&gt;Scripps College&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"liberal%20arts%20college\"&gt;liberal arts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20college\"&gt;women's college&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Claremont%2C%20California\"&gt;Claremont, California&lt;/a&gt;. It is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Claremont%20Colleges\"&gt;Claremont Colleges&lt;/a&gt;.\nKaufmann, along with landscape architect Edward Huntsman-Trout, designed the general campus plan featuring four residence halls to be built the first four consecutive years of the College (1927\u20131930). The project's design is primarily in the Mediterranean Revival style.\nWhile gaining recognition for Kaufmann's work on the Scripps campus, he was also hired by &lt;a href=\"California%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in 1928 to design the complex of dormitories now known as the &lt;a href=\"House%20System%20at%20the%20California%20Institute%20of%20Technology%23South%20Houses\"&gt;South Houses&lt;/a&gt;, and the building for the &lt;a href=\"Athenaeum%20at%20Caltech\"&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt;, a private club located on the school's campus.\nLater in his career, Kaufmann worked primarily in the &lt;a href=\"Art%20Deco\"&gt;Art Deco&lt;/a&gt; style, with a personal emphasis on massively thick, streamlined concrete walls which gave his buildings a very distinctive appearance. Kaufmann's buildings as a result took on a very \"mechanical\" appearance, often resembling huge versions of old-fashioned appliances. The \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Times\"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;\"' headquarters is a perfect example of this. His work was also part of the &lt;a href=\"Art%20competitions%20at%20the%201936%20Summer%20Olympics%23Architecture\"&gt;architecture event&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Art%20competitions%20at%20the%201936%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;art competition&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"1936%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1936 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.\nProjects.\nThis is a selected list of Kaufmann's projects.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1914, Kaufmann moved to California and settled in Fresno, California.\nKaufmann's wife was Elsie Bryant Kaufmann.\nOn 1 March 1949, Kaufmann died in Los Angeles California. Kaufmann is buried in Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno, California."
