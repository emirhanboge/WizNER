    "text": "The Hollister Carnegie Library (previously: Hollister Free Public Library; now Hollister City Hall) is located on 375 Fifth Street in &lt;a href=\"Hollister%2C%20California\"&gt;Hollister, California&lt;/a&gt;, US. Established in 1912 as a &lt;a href=\"Carnegie%20library\"&gt;Carnegie library&lt;/a&gt;, decades later, it was re-purposed as a &lt;a href=\"city%20hall\"&gt;city hall&lt;/a&gt;. The building is part of the downtown's National Register-listed &lt;a href=\"Historic%20districts%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;historic district&lt;/a&gt;, and was entered itself into the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20listings%20in%20San%20Benito%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;National Register&lt;/a&gt; on March 26, 1992.\nHistory.\nThe city's &lt;a href=\"public%20library\"&gt;public library&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1884, transitioned into the Hollister Library Association, the Mechanics Library Association, and the &lt;a href=\"Woman%27s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union\"&gt;Woman's Christian Temperance Union&lt;/a&gt; reading room. Though the library underwent an expansion after moving into a house on Fifth Street in the early 20th century, it was considered to be too small for the community. After receiving a $10,000 grant from the &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Carnegie\"&gt;Andrew Carnegie&lt;/a&gt; Library Foundation in 1910, construction of a Carnegie library began in 1911 at 375 Fifth Street. Designed by &lt;a href=\"William%20Binder\"&gt;William Binder&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%2C%20California\"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, the contractor was E. J. Sparling of Hollister. Costs associated with the project included US$2,034 for the lot, $9,983 for the building, and $500 for the furnishings. In 1960, the Holister library and the &lt;a href=\"San%20Benito%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;San Benito County&lt;/a&gt; library consolidated, moving into a new building at 470 Fifth Street, while the Carnegie building was re-purposed as a city hall.\nArchitecture and fittings.\nSet back from the street, the slightly raised site contains a retaining wall, lawn, garden area, walkway, and brick path.\nThe one story building with basement was designed in the &lt;a href=\"Neoclassicism\"&gt;Type A Classical Revival&lt;/a&gt; style. Its particular &lt;a href=\"classicism%23In%20architecture\"&gt;classicism&lt;/a&gt; architecture style was characterized as being unusually inhibited. There is an &lt;a href=\"asphalt\"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt; roof, molded panels, Ionic columns, exterior and interior stairways, casement windows, and bracketed sills. The structure was considered to be well adapted to its site as the &lt;a href=\"reinforced%20concrete\"&gt;reinforced concrete&lt;/a&gt; foundation and walls made sense for a city situated on the &lt;a href=\"Calaveras%20Fault\"&gt;Calaveras Fault&lt;/a&gt;. A rear expansion occurred in 1986."
