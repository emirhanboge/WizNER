    "text": "The Rotterdam Metro () is a &lt;a href=\"rapid%20transit\"&gt;rapid transit&lt;/a&gt; system operated in &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam\"&gt;Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rijnmond\"&gt;surrounding municipalities&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Rotterdamse%20Elektrische%20Tram\"&gt;RET&lt;/a&gt;. The first line, called \"Noord \u2013 Zuidlijn\" (North \u2013 South line) opened in 1968 and ran from &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Centraal%20station\"&gt;Centraal Station&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Zuidplein%20metro%20station\"&gt;Zuidplein&lt;/a&gt;, crossing the river &lt;a href=\"Nieuwe%20Maas\"&gt;Nieuwe Maas&lt;/a&gt; in a tunnel. It was the first &lt;a href=\"rapid%20transit\"&gt;metro&lt;/a&gt; system to open in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. At the time it was also one of the shortest metro lines in the world with a length of only .\nIn 1982 a second line was opened, the \"Oost \u2013 Westlijn\" (East \u2013 West line), running between &lt;a href=\"Capelsebrug%20metro%20station\"&gt;Capelsebrug&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coolhaven%20metro%20station\"&gt;Coolhaven&lt;/a&gt; stations. In the late 1990s, the lines were named after two historic &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam\"&gt;Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"citizens\"&gt;citizens&lt;/a&gt;, the Erasmus Line (North \u2013 South) after &lt;a href=\"Desiderius%20Erasmus\"&gt;Desiderius Erasmus&lt;/a&gt; and the Caland Line (East \u2013 West) after &lt;a href=\"Pieter%20Caland\"&gt;Pieter Caland&lt;/a&gt;. As of December 2009, these names were dropped again in favour of a combination of letters and colours, to emphasise and clarify the difference between the separate branches, especially of the former East \u2013 West line.\nLines.\nLines A and B.\nIn the northeast of Rotterdam, Lines A and B branch to &lt;a href=\"Binnenhof%20metro%20station\"&gt;Binnenhof&lt;/a&gt; (Line A) and to &lt;a href=\"Nesselande%20metro%20station\"&gt;Nesselande&lt;/a&gt; (Line B). The latter has been extended since September 2005; before that date, this line terminated at &lt;a href=\"De%20Tochten%20metro%20station\"&gt;De Tochten&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorth of &lt;a href=\"Capelsebrug%20metro%20station\"&gt;Capelsebrug station&lt;/a&gt; and west of &lt;a href=\"Schiedam%20Centrum%20station\"&gt;Schiedam Centrum station&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of the De Tochten-Nesselande section, Lines A and B have some &lt;a href=\"level%20crossing\"&gt;level crossing&lt;/a&gt;s (with priority), and could therefore be called &lt;a href=\"Medium-capacity%20rail%20system\"&gt;light rail&lt;/a&gt; instead of metro. These sections also have &lt;a href=\"overhead%20wires\"&gt;overhead wires&lt;/a&gt;, while most of the system has a &lt;a href=\"third%20rail\"&gt;third rail&lt;/a&gt; (the other exception is Line E (&lt;a href=\"RandstadRail\"&gt;RandstadRail&lt;/a&gt;) to The Hague). However, the term light rail is not used in Rotterdam; most people just call these branches metro.\nAs of 30 September 2019 Line B is connected to the &lt;a href=\"Schiedam%E2%80%93Hoek%20van%20Holland%20railway\"&gt;Schiedam\u2013Hoek van Holland railway&lt;/a&gt; line, extending the metro network to &lt;a href=\"Hook%20of%20Holland\"&gt;Hook of Holland&lt;/a&gt; (Hoek van Holland), while line A will operate on this line as far as &lt;a href=\"Vlaardingen%20West%20metro%20station\"&gt;Vlaardingen West&lt;/a&gt;, starting 1 November 2019.\nLine C.\nAt Capelsebrug, Line C branches off the main East-West section to &lt;a href=\"De%20Terp%20metro%20station\"&gt;De Terp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Capelle%20aan%20den%20IJssel\"&gt;Capelle aan den IJssel&lt;/a&gt;. Until November 2002, the Calandlijn (now lines A, B and C) terminated in the west of Rotterdam, at &lt;a href=\"Marconiplein%20metro%20station\"&gt;Marconiplein&lt;/a&gt;. On 4 November 2002 an extension through the city of &lt;a href=\"Schiedam\"&gt;Schiedam&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Spijkenisse\"&gt;Spijkenisse&lt;/a&gt; was opened. The extension included four new stations in Schiedam (including &lt;a href=\"Schiedam%20Centrum%20station\"&gt;Schiedam Centrum station&lt;/a&gt;) and one in &lt;a href=\"Pernis%2C%20Netherlands\"&gt;Pernis&lt;/a&gt;. Line C joins Line D at the &lt;a href=\"Tussenwater%20metro%20station\"&gt;Tussenwater station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hoogvliet\"&gt;Hoogvliet&lt;/a&gt;. Line A and B branch off to the Schiedam-Hoek van Holland railway, while Line C trains continue and, like those on the Line D, terminate at &lt;a href=\"De%20Akkers%20metro%20station\"&gt;De Akkers station&lt;/a&gt; in Spijkenisse.\nLine D.\nLine D runs from &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Centraal%20station\"&gt;Rotterdam Centraal&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Beurs%20metro%20station\"&gt;Beurs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slinge%20metro%20station\"&gt;Slinge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhoon%20metro%20station\"&gt;Rhoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tussenwater%20metro%20station\"&gt;Tussenwater&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spijkenisse%20Centrum%20metro%20station\"&gt;Spijkenisse Centrum&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"De%20Akkers%20metro%20station\"&gt;De Akkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nLine D intersects with Lines A, B and C at Beurs station. Before the connection with Line E at Rotterdam Centraal was realized in December 2011, some Line D trains terminated at Slinge during rush hours.\nLine E.\nLine E is a direct conversion of the former \"&lt;a href=\"Hofpleinlijn\"&gt;Hofpleinlijn&lt;/a&gt;\" from a railway line to a rapid transit line in 2006. The section of the route between &lt;a href=\"Den%20Haag%20Laan%20van%20NOI%20railway%20station\"&gt;Laan van NOI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leidschendam-Voorburg%20RandstadRail%20station\"&gt;Leidschendam-Voorburg&lt;/a&gt; is shared with light rail vehicles on two routes from the &lt;a href=\"Trams%20in%20The%20Hague\"&gt;Hague tram network&lt;/a&gt; heading towards &lt;a href=\"Zoetermeer\"&gt;Zoetermeer&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Zoetermeer%20Stadslijn\"&gt;Zoetermeer Stadslijn&lt;/a&gt;. All of these services fall under the &lt;a href=\"RandstadRail\"&gt;RandstadRail&lt;/a&gt; branding.\nAt the time of opening, the old &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Hofplein%20railway%20station\"&gt;Hofplein station&lt;/a&gt; was temporarily kept as the line's southern terminus. On 17 August 2010, however, a new tunnel opened, which connected the metro station at &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam%20Centraal%20railway%20station\"&gt;Rotterdam Centraal&lt;/a&gt; via a new tunnel and new &lt;a href=\"Blijdorp%20RandstadRail%20station\"&gt;Blijdorp station&lt;/a&gt; with the existing tracks near &lt;a href=\"Melanchthonweg%20RandstadRail%20station\"&gt;Melanchthonweg station&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the next year, work was in progress to connect Line D to Line E at Rotterdam Centraal station. Since the completion of this project in December 2011, all trains coming from &lt;a href=\"Den%20Haag%20Centraal%20railway%20station\"&gt;Den Haag Centraal&lt;/a&gt; terminate at &lt;a href=\"Slinge%20metro%20station\"&gt;Slinge&lt;/a&gt; (these are Line E trains), while line D continues in service between &lt;a href=\"De%20Akkers%20metro%20station\"&gt;De Akkers&lt;/a&gt; and Rotterdam Centraal.\nThe line's northern terminus used the former railway platforms at &lt;a href=\"Den%20Haag%20Centraal%20railway%20station\"&gt;Den Haag Centraal&lt;/a&gt;, which had been inherited from NS and in use since 1975, having been moved from the previous terminus at &lt;a href=\"Den%20Haag%20HS%20railway%20station\"&gt;Den Haag Hollands Spoor&lt;/a&gt;. These platforms remained in use until 12 February 2016. The line was then closed between here and Laan Van NOI while construction was completed of a new station built on an elevated viaduct adjacent to the railway platforms. This opened on 22 August 2016. \nRolling stock.\nTrains series 5300, 5400, 5500, 5600 and 5700 are &lt;a href=\"Bombardier%20Flexity%20Swift\"&gt;Bombardier Flexity Swift&lt;/a&gt;s. The series 5500 trains, made between 2007 and 2009, were built for the new RandstadRail Line E. The 5601-5642 trains were built to replace older &lt;a href=\"Duewag\"&gt;Duewag&lt;/a&gt; stock (series 5200). In 2013, RET announced that it ordered 16 additional vehicles of SG3 stock to run on the Hoekse Line extension. A further six vehicles were ordered to increase capacity on the Randstadrail branch in 2015. Delivery of these 22 vehicles, called HSG3, took place between 2015 and 2017.\nOverview.\nThe Line B extension to Hoek van Holland Strand will open in 2022. In 2015, there were about 175,000 daily riders of Lines A, B and C. There were 145,000 on Lines D and E.\nFuture extensions.\nRET plans to build a connecting line from &lt;a href=\"Kralingse%20Zoom%20metro%20station\"&gt;Kralingse Zoom station&lt;/a&gt; to the new &lt;a href=\"Feijenoord%20%28neighbourhood%29\"&gt;Feijenoord City&lt;/a&gt; housing area, and then on to Zuidplein, Charlois and Rotterdam Central station; along with plans to convert two tracks of four heavy-rail tracks between Rotterdam Central and &lt;a href=\"Dordrecht\"&gt;Dordrecht&lt;/a&gt; to metro operation. By adding extra stations and operating trains at two-minute interval RET expects to achieve a significant increase in traffic. Another ambition is to automate the metro to achieve 90-second headways.\nTraction power.\nTrains run on 750 &lt;a href=\"volts\"&gt;volts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Direct%20current\"&gt;DC power&lt;/a&gt; which is supplied through a bottom-contact &lt;a href=\"third%20rail\"&gt;third rail&lt;/a&gt; throughout most of the system. There are multiple &lt;a href=\"spring-loaded\"&gt;spring-loaded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"contact%20shoe\"&gt;contact shoe&lt;/a&gt;s on both sides of the vehicle, which are loaded and unloaded automatically due to the slanted edges of third rail ends. This allows the rail to be installed on either side of the track, a necessity around &lt;a href=\"Railroad%20switch\"&gt;points&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"station%20platform\"&gt;station platform&lt;/a&gt;s. There is sufficient overlap between the two rails on either end to avoid a \"gapped\" train, a situation where none of the shoes are in contact with the live rail. To reduce the risk of &lt;a href=\"electric%20shock\"&gt;electrocution&lt;/a&gt;, the rail consists of a sturdy yellow &lt;a href=\"Electrical%20insulation\"&gt;insulating&lt;/a&gt; material, with the live current carried on a thick metal strip on the bottom side. This also guards against grime (such as from fallen autumn &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;) reducing or preventing electrical contact.\nThree lines do however have sections that use &lt;a href=\"overhead%20wires\"&gt;overhead wires&lt;/a&gt;. These are lines A (towards &lt;a href=\"Binnenhof%20%28Rotterdam%20Metro%29\"&gt;Binnenhof&lt;/a&gt;), B (towards &lt;a href=\"Nesselande%20%28Rotterdam%20Metro%29\"&gt;Nesselande&lt;/a&gt;), and E (towards &lt;a href=\"Den%20Haag%20Centraal\"&gt;Den Haag Centraal&lt;/a&gt;). On lines A and B, trains raise or lower their &lt;a href=\"pantograph%20%28rail%29\"&gt;pantographs&lt;/a&gt; while the vehicle is in motion just east of &lt;a href=\"Capelsebrug%20%28Rotterdam%20Metro%29\"&gt;Capelsebrug station&lt;/a&gt;, while on line E this happens while stationary at &lt;a href=\"Melanchthonweg%20RandstadRail%20station\"&gt;Melanchtonweg station&lt;/a&gt; (this leads to the only level crossing with third rail in the country being at the Kleiweg just outside the tunnel heading to &lt;a href=\"Blijdorp%20RandstadRail%20station\"&gt;Blijdorp station&lt;/a&gt;). Note that Line B trains switch back to third rail for the final leg of the journey, from the penultimate station &lt;a href=\"De%20Tochten%20%28Rotterdam%20Metro%29\"&gt;De Tochten&lt;/a&gt; to Nesselande. The western extension of lines A and B to Hook of Holland also use overhead power as they are converted directly from the existing railway line.\nThe sections of the metro that use overhead wires are called \"sneltram\" (light rail) by locals, as they include several protected &lt;a href=\"level%20crossings\"&gt;level crossings&lt;/a&gt; at street level, which trains pass through with priority, as in a conventional railway line. For this reason, trains with a pantograph (series 5200 and 5400) are equipped with &lt;a href=\"Automotive%20lighting%23Turn%20signals\"&gt;turn signals&lt;/a&gt; just like any road vehicle. This makes it easy to see the difference between series 5300 and series 5400 Bombardier-built trains. Series 5500 and 5600 trains are also equipped, although the former is normally used on line E only as they carry the RandstadRail branding and livery while the latter carries that of R-net."
