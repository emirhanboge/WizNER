    "text": "Noah Levine (born 1971) is an American &lt;a href=\"Buddhist\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; teacher and author, son of American Buddhist teacher and poet &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Levine%20%28author%29\"&gt;Stephen Levine&lt;/a&gt;. As a counselor known for his philosophical alignment with Buddhism and &lt;a href=\"punk%20ideology\"&gt;punk ideology&lt;/a&gt;, he identifies his Buddhist beliefs and practices with both the &lt;a href=\"Theravada\"&gt;Theravada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mahayana\"&gt;Mahayana&lt;/a&gt; traditions. He has written several books on Buddhism and Buddhist practice including \"Refuge Recovery: A Buddhist Path to Recovering from Addiction\".\nEarly life.\nNoah Levine is the son of American Buddhist author &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Levine%20%28author%29\"&gt;Stephen Levine&lt;/a&gt;. His parents had a history of addiction and, when he was very young, they divorced. He states he has had a \"core distrust of authority\" his whole life, which led him to reject the teachings of his father. At the age of five, Levine began exhibiting suicidal behavior and the next year began smoking marijuana. He discovered &lt;a href=\"punk%20rock\"&gt;punk rock&lt;/a&gt; through the boyfriend of his older sister and the first time he heard the &lt;a href=\"Sex%20Pistols\"&gt;Sex Pistols&lt;/a&gt; \"was like hearing the voice of God\" because it expressed all the dissatisfaction he felt. His teenage years were filled with drugs, violence, multiple suicide attempts and detentions at &lt;a href=\"juvenile%20hall\"&gt;juvenile hall&lt;/a&gt;s, which was encouraged by the punk scene. In 1988 and after three &lt;a href=\"felonies\"&gt;felonies&lt;/a&gt; and one suicide attempt while jailed, he hit \"an emotional rock bottom\" and \"realized\" his addiction; in a desperate attempt to relieve his fear and uncertainty he tried to apply the &lt;a href=\"anapanasati\"&gt;anapanasati&lt;/a&gt; techniques his father taught him, and saw for the first time how this practice worked. Shortly afterward, he became highly involved in the &lt;a href=\"straight%20edge\"&gt;straight edge&lt;/a&gt; scene (a &lt;a href=\"hardcore%20punk\"&gt;hardcore punk&lt;/a&gt; associated movement whose members avoid drug and alcohol use), attended a &lt;a href=\"twelve-step%20program\"&gt;twelve-step program&lt;/a&gt; and began a meditation practice.\nHe was trained by &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Kornfield\"&gt;Jack Kornfield&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Rock%20Meditation%20Center\"&gt;Spirit Rock Meditation Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Woodacre%2C%20California\"&gt;Woodacre, California&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he earned a master's degree in &lt;a href=\"counseling%20psychology\"&gt;counseling psychology&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"California%20Institute%20of%20Integral%20Studies\"&gt;California Institute of Integral Studies&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nHe currently leads &lt;a href=\"Dharma\"&gt;Dharma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vipassana\"&gt;vipassana&lt;/a&gt; meditation retreats and workshops across the United States and teaches weekly meditation classes at Against the Stream Meditation Center in Los Angeles. A member of the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Dharma%20Network\"&gt;Prison Dharma Network&lt;/a&gt;, Levine works with juvenile and adult prison inmates, combining meditation techniques with principles from Western psychology. He \"[explores] how they can have a deeper understanding of what has happened and what they need to do in order to be free, on many levels\u2014free from prison, free from the trauma of the past.\"\nHe has helped found several groups and projects including the Mind Body Awareness Project, a non-profit organization that serves incarcerated youths, and Refuge Recovery, an &lt;a href=\"addiction%20recovery%20groups\"&gt;addiction recovery community&lt;/a&gt;.\nAllegations of Sexual misconduct.\nIn March 2018, Against the Stream released a statement that they were investigating allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of Noah Levine. \"It is with great regret we announce that we have received reports of sexual misconduct by Noah Levine which require an investigation. During the investigative process we are required to suspend Noah\u2019s teaching activities with Against the Stream and his membership on the Board of Directors.\" Levine denied the accusations, stating in a letter to the community \"This never happened.\"\nThe ATS Grievance Council retained attorney Roberta Yang to independently investigate the accusations against Levine. In August 2018, ATS released a statement announcing that Yang and the Board of Directors had concluded that the preponderance of evidence indicated that Levine had likely violated the Third Precept of the ATS Teacher's Code of Ethics, which requires teachers to \"avoid creating harm through sexuality,\" with multiple women. Levine was removed from the ATS Board of Directors, and the Board announced that its centers in Melrose, &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Monica%2C%20California\"&gt;Santa Monica&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; would close as a result of financial difficulties stemming from the allegations against Levine.\nIn a Facebook livestream shortly following the announcement of the closing of ATS, Levine clarified that there were no accusations from ATS students. \nThe report prepared for ATS was leaked in fall 2018 and some details appeared to contradict Levine's claims.\nOn February 20, 2019, Spirit Rock Meditation Center's Ethics and Reconciliation Council released a statement that the organization and Dr. Jack Kornfield rescinded his authorization to teach. \nSpirit Rock had previously indefinitely suspended Levine from teaching there, pending the investigation by the ATS organization, which was founded by Levine. That investigation, completed in August, concluded that showed Levine had likely violated the Third Precept, \u201cto avoid creating harm through sexuality\u201d and was followed by the dissolution of ATS. The EAR Council then \u201cconducted its own investigation, a long and careful process of collecting information from numerous sources in order to determine Mr. Levine\u2019s fitness for teaching.\"\nSubject of documentary.\nLevine is the subject of the feature-length documentary, \"Meditate and Destroy\", directed by Sarah Fisher of Blue Lotus Films. The documentary was shown in film festivals and independent screenings from 2007 to 2008. \"Meditate and Destroy\" was released on DVD in 2009 by Alive Mind Media."
