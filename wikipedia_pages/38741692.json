    "text": "The Ch\u00e2teau de B\u00e9larga is a \"&lt;a href=\"ch%C3%A2teau\"&gt;ch\u00e2teau&lt;/a&gt;\" constructed in the 17th century. Part of the building is from an earlier &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. It is located on the left bank of the &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A9rault%20%28river%29\"&gt;H\u00e9rault River&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20France\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9larga\"&gt;B\u00e9larga&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A9rault\"&gt;H\u00e9rault&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;d\u00e9partement&lt;/a&gt;\" of France.\nHistory.\nA castle was recorded in B\u00e9larga before 1281, in a document concerning the construction of a village. An \"&lt;a href=\"enceinte\"&gt;enceinte&lt;/a&gt;\" commanded by this fortress was built at the end of the 13th century or the beginning of the 14th century. The building dominated a &lt;a href=\"ford%20%28crossing%29\"&gt;ford&lt;/a&gt; over the H\u00e9rault which was subject to a toll.\nThe area belonged to the Guilhem family, powerful lords of Clermont-Lod\u00e8ve (today &lt;a href=\"Clermont-l%27H%C3%A9rault\"&gt;Clermont-l'H\u00e9rault&lt;/a&gt;). Berenger IV of Guilhem was described as lord of the \"castrum de Belesgario\" in 1310. His successor, Pierre de Clermont, is infamous for having committed in B\u00e9larga a crime against the person of a young woman from &lt;a href=\"Puilacher\"&gt;Puilacher&lt;/a&gt;, for which he was condemned in 1310 by the &lt;a href=\"Seneschal\"&gt;s\u00e9n\u00e9chal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Carcassonne\"&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt;; the sentence was confirmed by the &lt;a href=\"Parlement%20de%20Paris\"&gt;Parlement de Paris&lt;/a&gt; on 29 January 1311 (\"see below\"). One result was the confiscation of the seigneurie of B\u00e9larga.\nIn the 17th century, the castle belonged to the Mirmans, a family of the &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20of%20the%20Robe\"&gt;Nobles of the Robe&lt;/a&gt; which included numerous magistrates in the sovereign courts of Languedoc. In 1654, the knight Fran\u00e7ois de Mirman, \"&lt;a href=\"Conseil%20du%20roi%20de%20France\"&gt;conseiller du roi&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Gabelle\"&gt;intendant des gabelles&lt;/a&gt;\", had the titles of \"baron de Florac, seigneur de B\u00e9larga, etc.\".\nThe Mirmans gave the building its current appearance, embellishing it \"in the rustic taste fashionable in the 17th century in Montpellier\".\nDescription.\nThe north wing of the present building probably dates from the 14th century, altered in the 15th. North of this, a new \"ch\u00e2teau\" was built in the 17th century.\nOwnership.\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de B\u00e9larga is private property, inhabited by its owners. It was the object of a study for the cultural heritage inventory by the French Ministry of Culture in 1976.\nPierre de Clermont's crime.\nOn 29 January 1311, the &lt;a href=\"Parlement%20de%20Paris\"&gt;Parlement de Paris&lt;/a&gt; confirmed a sentence passed by the s\u00e9n\u00e9chal of &lt;a href=\"Carcassonne\"&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt; on Pierre de Clermont, seigneur de B\u00e9larga, in these terms:"
