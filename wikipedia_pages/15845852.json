    "text": "Arnold Odermatt (25 May 1925 \u2212 19 June 2021) was a Swiss police &lt;a href=\"photographer\"&gt;photographer&lt;/a&gt; whose work spanned more than 40 years. Originally trained as a baker, he was a photographer for the &lt;a href=\"Nidwalden\"&gt;Nidwalden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cantonal%20police\"&gt;cantonal police&lt;/a&gt; from 1948 until his retirement in 1990. He is best known for his eerily beautiful &lt;a href=\"black%20and%20white\"&gt;black and white&lt;/a&gt; photographs of the aftermaths of motor vehicle accidents. Odermatt joined the police in 1948 and rose to become a lieutenant, chief of the transport police, and deputy chief inspector of the Nidwalden Police before he retired.\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, Odermatt's photography was discovered by his son, &lt;a href=\"Urs%20Odermatt\"&gt;Urs Odermatt&lt;/a&gt; during research for his film \"&lt;a href=\"Wachtmeister%20Zumb%C3%BChl\"&gt;Wachtmeister Zumb\u00fchl&lt;/a&gt;,\" and this work became a central theme in the film's plot. Urs brought his father's works together in the working groups entitled Meine Welt, Karambolage, Im Dienst, and In zivil and has published Odermatt's work ever since, working in collaboration with the Frankfurt art historian &lt;a href=\"Beate%20Kemfert\"&gt;Beate Kemfert&lt;/a&gt; and a gallery in Berlin\u2014&lt;a href=\"Galerie%20Springer%20%26amp%3B%20Winckler\"&gt;Galerie Springer &amp; Winckler&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2001, Odermatt's photography was selected by &lt;a href=\"Harald%20Szeemann\"&gt;Harald Szeemann&lt;/a&gt; to be exhibited at the &lt;a href=\"49th%20Venice%20Biennale\"&gt;49th Venice Biennale&lt;/a&gt;. In 2002 James Rondeau exhibited Odermatt's work in its own right at the &lt;a href=\"Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;Art Institute of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, as did &lt;a href=\"Urs%20Stahel\"&gt;Urs Stahel&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Fotomuseum%20Winterthur\"&gt;Fotomuseum Winterthur&lt;/a&gt; in 2004.\nBiography.\nOdermatt was born in &lt;a href=\"Oberdorf%2C%20Nidwalden\"&gt;Oberdorf&lt;/a&gt;, canton &lt;a href=\"Nidwalden\"&gt;Nidwalden&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland. He joined the Nidwalden Police in 1948. He was forced to give up his original career as a bakery and pastry chef on health grounds. As the policeman Odermatt first appeared with his &lt;a href=\"Rolleiflex\"&gt;Rolleiflex&lt;/a&gt; at the scene of an accident \u2013 to provide photos to complement the police report, people found this rather disconcerting. At that time, photography was anything other than an independent means of providing the police with evidence.\nA colleague observed Odermatt as he took pictures for the force and was suspicious. He was ordered to report to his commander immediately. Odermatt managed to convince his superiors of the pioneering work he was doing. They allowed him to convert an old toilet in an observation post in Stans into a makeshift darkroom. When the observation post was moved into another building several years later, Switzerland\u2019s first police photographer was given his own laboratory.\nOdermatt's biggest role model was the famous &lt;a href=\"Magnum%20Photos\"&gt;Magnum&lt;/a&gt; photographer &lt;a href=\"Werner%20Bischof\"&gt;Werner Bischof&lt;/a&gt;. He met him once by chance, as he was on security duty on the &lt;a href=\"B%C3%BCrgenstock\"&gt;B\u00fcrgenstock&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to photograph &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Chaplin\"&gt;Charlie Chaplin&lt;/a&gt;. Odermatt's own style was characterised by sobriety and authenticity. The spartan linguistic expression of his police reports can also be found in Odermatt\u2019s images. His craftsmanship is beyond question, nothing of note is missed by his photographic eye. In KARAMBOLAGE, his most famous series of work, you can\u2019t see the maimed victims but you do see the ethereal, surreal sculptures of scrap metal. With the softness and melancholy of &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Tati\"&gt;Jacques Tati&lt;/a&gt;, he looks at the consequences of speed and the hectic nature of modern times.\nFor 40 years, Odermatt captured the daily work of the Nidwalden police force. It was only rarely that the local press, the court or an insurance company were interested in his photos. It was only when his son, the film and theatre director Urs Odermatt, showed the photos for the first time at a solo exhibition in &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20am%20Main\"&gt;Frankfurt am Main&lt;/a&gt; that the art scene first became interested in his work. After the inspiring exhibition, the photo book 'Meine Welt' followed. Suddenly the everyday observations from the central Swiss province had gained the same status as those of his well-travelled predecessor, Werner Bischof.\nAt an early stage in his police career, when Arnold used the camera to catalogue traffic accidents, this was a revolutionary innovation in the Swiss police. If Odermatt were to turn up at a crime scene with his camera today, he could expect to be told that photography was not for him, but was instead the job of a specially trained police photographer.\nFilms.\nIn the 1960s Odermatt documented the early construction of the Swiss motorways in Acheregg and the &lt;a href=\"Lopper%20Road%20Tunnel\"&gt;Lopper tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, with extensive photos and 16mm black-and-white film footage. In 1991 Urs Odermatt put all of this historical film material together in the documentary film Lopper.\nIn the 1990s, working as a stills photographer, during filming, Odermatt worked on the feature films Rotlicht!, Gekauftes Gl\u00fcck und Wachtmeister Zumb\u00fchl by Urs Odermatt."
