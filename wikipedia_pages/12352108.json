He remained there for two and a half seasons, winning the &lt;a href=\"2015%20DFB-Pokal%20Final\"&gt;2015 DFB-Pokal Final&lt;/a&gt;, before moving to &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; for \u20ac16\u00a0million. In 2019, he joined &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; on loan, winning the &lt;a href=\"Treble%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;treble&lt;/a&gt;.

Instrumental to &lt;a href=\"Croatia%20national%20football%20team%23Dali%C4%87%20period%20and%20the%20second%20%26quot%3Bgolden%20generation%26quot%3B%20%282017%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;Croatia's second \"golden generation\"&lt;/a&gt;, Peri\u0161i\u0107 is the nation's player with most goal contributions at the major tournaments (14), and the first Croatian player ever to score in a World Cup final.\nClub career.\nEarly career.\nPeri\u0161i\u0107 played in the youth ranks of the club he grew up supporting, &lt;a href=\"HNK%20Hajduk%20Split\"&gt;Hajduk Split&lt;/a&gt;. He received interest from a number of clubs, including &lt;a href=\"R.S.C.%20Anderlecht\"&gt;Anderlecht&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PSV%20Eindhoven\"&gt;PSV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hertha%20BSC\"&gt;Hertha BSC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hamburger%20SV\"&gt;Hamburger SV&lt;/a&gt;. The only match he played for Hajduk was a friendly 3\u20131 win over &lt;a href=\"FK%20Smederevo%201924\"&gt;Smederevo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Murska%20Sobota\"&gt;Murska Sobota&lt;/a&gt; on 16 July 2006. Returning from Murska Sobota to &lt;a href=\"Split%2C%20Croatia\"&gt;Split&lt;/a&gt;, Peri\u0161i\u0107 received offers from Anderlecht and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Sochaux-Montb%C3%A9liard\"&gt;Sochaux&lt;/a&gt;. Hajduk offered Peri\u0161i\u0107 a \u20ac100,000 contract, which was only \u20ac20,000 less than Hajduk's best player &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Kranj%C4%8Dar\"&gt;Niko Kranj\u010dar&lt;/a&gt;'s contract. However, the Peri\u0161i\u0107 family opted for French club Sochaux, which paid \u20ac360,000 to sign him in the summer of 2006. Sochaux's coach &lt;a href=\"Alain%20Perrin\"&gt;Alain Perrin&lt;/a&gt; personally arrived to Split with a private jet to convince Peri\u0161i\u0107 to sign, waiting two days for his signature. His physical and technical attributes led to comparisons to former Croatia international &lt;a href=\"Aljo%C5%A1a%20Asanovi%C4%87\"&gt;Aljo\u0161a Asanovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; by some journalists. He was a member of the Sochaux youth team, which won the &lt;a href=\"Coupe%20Gambardella\"&gt;Coupe Gambardella&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. During his time at Sochaux, he failed to make a first-team appearance, but did play for the B team. In January 2009, Peri\u0161i\u0107 was sent on loan to &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20First%20Division%20A\"&gt;Belgian top flight&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"K.S.V.%20Roeselare\"&gt;Roeselare&lt;/a&gt; for six months. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Belgian%20First%20Division\"&gt;2008\u201309 season&lt;/a&gt;, there were reports Peri\u0161i\u0107 sought to join Belgian side Anderlecht.\nClub Brugge.\nOn 26 August 2009, Belgian club &lt;a href=\"Club%20Brugge%20KV\"&gt;Club Brugge&lt;/a&gt; acquired Peri\u0161i\u0107 from Sochaux for a \u20ac250,000 transfer fee and signed him to a three-year contract. Prior his move, Peri\u0161i\u0107 was linked with a move to German side Hertha BSC, having gone on trial.\nIn the opening match of the season, Peri\u0161i\u0107 scored his first goal in a 1\u20131 draw against &lt;a href=\"K.R.C.%20Genk\"&gt;Genk&lt;/a&gt;, then scored his second in two consecutive games and provided assists in a 4\u20131 win over &lt;a href=\"K.V.C.%20Westerlo\"&gt;Westerlo&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, Peri\u0161i\u0107 scored 9 goals in 33 league appearances, also making eight appearances in Brugge's &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt; campaign, scoring four goals. At the end of the season, Peri\u0161i\u0107 signed a new three-year contract at Brugge, keeping him until 2015.\nBelgian football critics predicted a bright future for Peri\u0161i\u0107. In the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Belgian%20Pro%20League\"&gt;2010\u201311 season&lt;/a&gt;, he was the top scorer of the Belgian Jupiler Pro League after scoring 22 goals for Club Brugge, also being named &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20professional%20football%20awards%23Professional%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Player of the Year&lt;/a&gt; in Belgium. During the season, Peri\u0161i\u0107 scored four goals and provided an assist in a 5\u20130 win against &lt;a href=\"R.%20Charleroi%20S.C.\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt; on 29 December 2010.\nBorussia Dortmund.\nOn 23 May 2011, Peri\u0161i\u0107 signed a five-year contract to play for German side &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20Dortmund\"&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt; after Dortmund paid an estimated \u20ac5\u00a0million transfer fee to Brugge. He made his debut for the club in their 3\u20131 home victory over Hamburger SV on 5 August, substituting on for &lt;a href=\"Chris%20L%C3%B6we\"&gt;Chris L\u00f6we&lt;/a&gt; in the 75th minute. During a &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; match on 13 September 2011, he scored a late equaliser with a volley from 20 yards against &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; after entering as a substitute in the 69th minute. On 14 October, he scored the first goal in a 2\u20130 win against &lt;a href=\"SV%20Werder%20Bremen\"&gt;Werder Bremen&lt;/a&gt;, a match in which he was later sent off for a second bookable offence. On 21 April 2012, he scored the important 1\u20130 goal against &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach\"&gt;Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach&lt;/a&gt; and opened the door to the eighth national championship for Dortmund. The game ended 2\u20130 (the second was scored by &lt;a href=\"Shinji%20Kagawa\"&gt;Shinji Kagawa&lt;/a&gt;).\nPeri\u0161i\u0107 began the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga\"&gt;2012\u201313 Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; season scoring a brace in a 3\u20132 loss against Hamburger SV on 22 September 2012. However, Peri\u0161i\u0107 soon found his first team opportunities limited, having played less in the first team and soon told Croatian channel &lt;a href=\"Nova%20TV%20%28Croatia%29\"&gt;Nova TV&lt;/a&gt; he had received no support from Dortmund manager &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp\"&gt;J\u00fcrgen Klopp&lt;/a&gt; and accused him of favouring other players. In response, Klopp criticised his actions as childish and Peri\u0161i\u0107 faced a fine due to his comment.\nVfL Wolfsburg.\nOn 6 January 2013, it was reported Peri\u0161i\u0107 transferred for \u20ac8\u00a0million to &lt;a href=\"VfL%20Wolfsburg\"&gt;VfL Wolfsburg&lt;/a&gt;. He scored his first goal for Wolfsburg in a friendly match against &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Standard Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt; on 10 January. He made his competitive debut for Wolfsburg against &lt;a href=\"VfB%20Stuttgart\"&gt;VfB Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; on 19 January 2013. In March, he suffered a left knee injury that sidelined him throughout March and April. He made his comeback in May in the match against Hamburger SV, coming on as a substitute and providing an assist. On 11 May 2013, he faced his former club Borussia Dortmund, scoring two goals.\nOn 3 August 2013, Peri\u0161i\u0107 scored his first cup goal for Wolfsburg in their 3\u20131 win against &lt;a href=\"Karlsruher%20SC\"&gt;Karlsruher SC&lt;/a&gt;. On 26 October 2013, Peri\u0161i\u0107 opened his goal scoring form in the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Bundesliga\"&gt;2013\u201314 season&lt;/a&gt; in their 3\u20130 win against Werder Bremen, also creating an assist on a goal. On matchday 30, he scored a brace in Wolfsburg's 4\u20131 home win against &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg\"&gt;1. FC N\u00fcrnberg&lt;/a&gt;. Peri\u0161i\u0107 finished the season with ten league goals, second-best on the team behind fellow countryman &lt;a href=\"Ivica%20Oli%C4%87\"&gt;Ivica Oli\u0107&lt;/a&gt;.\nInter Milan.\nOn 30 August 2015, Peri\u0161i\u0107 signed with Italian club &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Inter Milan&lt;/a&gt; on a five-year contract for a transfer fee of \u20ac16\u00a0million. He was presented on 10 September alongside &lt;a href=\"Adem%20Ljaji%C4%87\"&gt;Adem Ljaji\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, where he was assigned squad number 44, stating, \"Inter were too big an opportunity to turn down.\"\n2015\u201316 season.\nPeri\u0161i\u0107 made his competitive debut for the club three days later, starting and playing 85 minutes in a 1\u20130 win against cross-city rivals &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Derby%20della%20Madonnina\"&gt;Derby della Madonnina&lt;/a&gt;\".

Upon signing, Peri\u0161i\u0107 said, \"It's a special day, it's certainly emotional and I'm happy after the stress of this summer. Now, we can look forward and I'm only thinking about Inter. After signing, the pitch is the only thing left for me to think about.\"\nHis second goal of the season, a late screamer outside the zone against newly promoted &lt;a href=\"S.P.A.L.%202013\"&gt;SPAL&lt;/a&gt; two days later, was his 20th career Serie A goal. Peri\u0161i\u0107 scored his first &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Serie%20A%20hat-tricks\"&gt;Serie A hat-trick&lt;/a&gt; on 3 December in the 5\u20130 home win over Chievo. His 100th appearance in all competitions for Inter occurred later on 30 December in the goalless draw versus &lt;a href=\"S.S.%20Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt; on matchday 19.\n2018\u201319 season.\nPeri\u0161i\u0107 played his first &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; game for Inter on 18 September 2018, in a 2\u20131 victory over &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn January 2019, English club Arsenal attempted to sign Peri\u0161i\u0107. He agreed a deal with the club; however, Inter blocked the deal. Teammate &lt;a href=\"Mauro%20Icardi\"&gt;Mauro Icardi&lt;/a&gt;'s agent &lt;a href=\"Wanda%20Nara\"&gt;Wanda Nara&lt;/a&gt; spoke out about Peri\u0161i\u0107's reasons for the departure, speculating that they might be of personal nature. Nara's comments resulted in a fallout between the players, resulting in Icardi being stripped of captaincy and dropped from the team ahead of a &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt; away fixture against &lt;a href=\"SK%20Rapid%20Wien\"&gt;Rapid Wien&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeri\u0161i\u0107 featured in 34 matches in &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;, only behind &lt;a href=\"Samir%20Handanovi%C4%87\"&gt;Samir Handanovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Matteo%20Politano\"&gt;Matteo Politano&lt;/a&gt;, scoring 8 goals; hence being the second top scorer for Inter after Icardi.
