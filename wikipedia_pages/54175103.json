    "text": "Kimonas or Kimon Zografakis (, 1918 \u2013 23 November 2004), frequently referred to by his nom de guerre, Black Man, was a distinguished &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Partisan%20%28military%29\"&gt;partisan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cretan%20resistance\"&gt;Cretan resistance&lt;/a&gt; from 1941 \u2013 1944 against the &lt;a href=\"Axis%20occupation%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Axis occupation forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly years.\nKimonas Zografakis was born and raised in the village of &lt;a href=\"Kastelli%2C%20Heraklion\"&gt;Kastelli Pediados&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt;. His parents were Georgios (nicknamed \"Xirouhis\", Greek: \"\u039e\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2\") and Ekaterini (n\u00e9e Katzagiannakis) Zografakis, who had two daughters and six sons. During the &lt;a href=\"Greco-Italian%20War\"&gt;Greco-Italian War&lt;/a&gt; (1940\u201341), Kimon Zografakis served on the &lt;a href=\"Greco-Italian%20War\"&gt;Albanian front&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld War II.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Greece\"&gt;surrender of mainland Greece&lt;/a&gt; in April 1941, Zografakis returned to Crete. He participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Crete\"&gt;Battle of Crete&lt;/a&gt;, fighting at &lt;a href=\"Heraklion%2C%20Crete\"&gt;Kokkini Chani, just east of Heraklion, Crete&lt;/a&gt; along the coastal highway. After the fall of Crete, he rejoined his family at &lt;a href=\"Kastelli%2C%20Heraklion\"&gt;Kastelli&lt;/a&gt;. In early 1942, the German occupation forces started the expansion of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Kastelli%20Airport\"&gt;airfield&lt;/a&gt;. Zografakis' father, elected as the president of the local community, was ordered to organize his fellow villagers into forced labor camps at the behest of their Germans occupiers. However, he was unwilling to cooperate and he resigned from his post. He moved his family to the village of &lt;a href=\"Kastelli%2C%20Heraklion\"&gt;Kastamonitsa, a village just southeast of Kastelli&lt;/a&gt;. At Kastamonitsa, the entire family partook in the &lt;a href=\"Cretan%20Resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt;, developing links with &lt;a href=\"National%20Organization%20of%20Crete\"&gt;EOK&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecial Operations Executive.\nYoung Kimon sought an opportunity to reach the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20the%20Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, and thus, joined &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Great Britain's 8th Army&lt;/a&gt; in North Africa who were fighting &lt;a href=\"Axis%20powers\"&gt;the Axis countries&lt;/a&gt;. In early June 1942, he got his chance when he assisted a group of &lt;a href=\"Special%20Boat%20Service\"&gt;SBS&lt;/a&gt; commandos carrying out the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DvkGtBAAAQBAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA33%26amp%3Bdq%3Dkimon%2Bzografakis%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Bved%3D0ahUKEwit7-nh0dbZAhUGpFkKHaS3AN0Q6AEIMjAC%23v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3Dkimon%2520zografakis%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse\"&gt;sabotage of the Kastelli Airfield&lt;/a&gt;. After the operation, he followed the British commandos to the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20the%20Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; where he fought in battles at &lt;a href=\"First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein\"&gt;El Alamein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mersa%20Matruh\"&gt;Mersa Matruh&lt;/a&gt;. He later joined &lt;a href=\"Special%20Operations%20Executive\"&gt;Force 133&lt;/a&gt; and trained as a &lt;a href=\"Parachuting\"&gt;parachutist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"saboteur\"&gt;saboteur&lt;/a&gt;. After returning to Crete in July 1943, he took part in the &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Albumen\"&gt;second sabotage&lt;/a&gt; against the Kastelli Airfield under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Anders%20Lassen\"&gt;Anders Lassen&lt;/a&gt;.\nZografakis eventually escaped again to Egypt. In October 1943, after the battle of Kato Simi and the &lt;a href=\"Viannos%20massacres\"&gt;Viannos massacres&lt;/a&gt;, the Germans arrested many Greek officers. This was in reprisal for the death of German soldiers and for their complicity with the &lt;a href=\"Cretan%20Resistance\"&gt;Cretan Resistance&lt;/a&gt; as well as assisting the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Operations%20Executive\"&gt;SOE&lt;/a&gt;. Among them was Kimonas' brother, Giannis, who was a reserve &lt;a href=\"Anthypolochagos\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; injured at the &lt;a href=\"Greco-Italian%20War\"&gt;Albanian front&lt;/a&gt;. Giannis Zografakis was court-martialed and sentenced to death with four other officers. They were executed in &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20prisons%20in%20Greece\"&gt;Agia Prison&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Chania\"&gt;Canea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, under the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Operations%20Executive\"&gt;SOE&lt;/a&gt;'s command of &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Rendel\"&gt;Sandy 'Alexis' Rendel&lt;/a&gt;, Zografakis secretly returned to Crete. He took part in several &lt;a href=\"clandestine%20operation\"&gt;clandestine operation&lt;/a&gt;s mostly in eastern Crete. He was part of a group of partisans operating a &lt;a href=\"wireless\"&gt;wireless&lt;/a&gt; radio hidden in the caves of the &lt;a href=\"Dikti\"&gt;Dikti&lt;/a&gt; range. Along with SOE-trained John Androulakis, he partook in the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3D9euhPIt-d2oC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA42%26amp%3Bdq%3Dpeza%2Boil%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Bved%3D0ahUKEwj7iLOq4dbZAhWMt1kKHUc1B7cQ6AEINDAC%23v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3Dpeza%2520oil%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse\"&gt;Peza oil field sabotage&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn February 1944, Zografakis met the legendary &lt;a href=\"Special%20Operations%20Executive\"&gt;SOE&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Leigh%20Fermor\"&gt;Patrick Leigh Fermor&lt;/a&gt;, who parachuted into Crete at &lt;a href=\"Katharo\"&gt;Katharo&lt;/a&gt; plateau, assisting him in the preparation of Gen. &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Kreipe\"&gt;Heinrich Kreipe&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kidnap%20of%20Heinrich%20Kreipe\"&gt;abduction&lt;/a&gt;. In early April 1944, Zografakis &lt;a href=\"https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DVzB2BwAAQBAJ%26amp%3Bprintsec%3Dfrontcover%26amp%3Bdq%3Dthe%2Bbattle%2Bof%2Bcrete%2C%2Bkimon%2Bzografakis%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Bved%3D0ahUKEwiauPe-iNvZAhUSP6wKHbF0C5gQ6AEIOTAD%23v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3Dzografakis%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse\"&gt;sheltered Kreipe's abductors at his family house&lt;/a&gt; in Kastamonitsa for more than a fortnight. In August 1944, he participated in a successful attack against fuel dumps in Drasi, &lt;a href=\"Mirabello%20Bay\"&gt;Mirabello&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost World War II years.\nZografakis was awarded several medals from Greece and Great Britain for his service. However, in 1955, after disagreeing with the British government &lt;a href=\"Cyprus%20Emergency\"&gt;over its policies in Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, he respectfully returned the medals given from Britain."
