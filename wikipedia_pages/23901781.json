    "text": "S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag was a &lt;a href=\"Counties%20of%20Norway\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; comprising the southern portion of the present-day &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%B8ndelag\"&gt;Tr\u00f8ndelag&lt;/a&gt; county in &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. It bordered the old &lt;a href=\"Nord-Tr%C3%B8ndelag\"&gt;Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag&lt;/a&gt; county as well as the counties of &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B8re%20og%20Romsdal\"&gt;M\u00f8re og Romsdal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oppland\"&gt;Oppland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hedmark\"&gt;Hedmark&lt;/a&gt;. To the west is the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Sea\"&gt;Norwegian Sea&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;), and to the east is &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4mtland\"&gt;J\u00e4mtland&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. The county was separated into a northern and southern part by the &lt;a href=\"Trondheimsfjord\"&gt;Trondheimsfjord&lt;/a&gt;. Slightly over 200,000 of the county's population (or around 55%) lives in the city of &lt;a href=\"Trondheim\"&gt;Trondheim&lt;/a&gt; and its suburbs. The &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20language\"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dialect\"&gt;dialect&lt;/a&gt; of the region is &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%B8ndersk\"&gt;Tr\u00f8ndersk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region was divided into two administrative counties in 1804. In 2016, the two county councils voted to merge into &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%B8ndelag\"&gt;a single county&lt;/a&gt; on 1 January 2018.\nName.\nThe name \"S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag\" was created in 1919. It means '(the) southern (part of) &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%B8ndelag\"&gt;Tr\u00f8ndelag&lt;/a&gt;'.\nUntil 1919 the name of the county was \"S\u00f8ndre Trondhjems amt\". The meaning of this name was '(the) southern (part of) Trondhjems &lt;a href=\"amt%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;amt&lt;/a&gt;'. (The old \"Trondhjems amt\", created in 1662, was divided in 1804. \"Trondhjem\" is the old form of &lt;a href=\"Trondheim\"&gt;Trondheim&lt;/a&gt;.)\nSee also &lt;a href=\"Nord-Tr%C3%B8ndelag\"&gt;Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag&lt;/a&gt;\nCoat of arms.\nThe &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;coat of arms&lt;/a&gt; was from modern times (1983) - but it had old roots: it was the seal of , archbishop of Trondheim 1475\u20131510.\nGeography.\nS\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag consisted of 25 municipalities and had a total area of . Trondheim is the largest city and the county's administrative center.\nThe broad and long &lt;a href=\"Trondheimsfjord\"&gt;Trondheimsfjord&lt;/a&gt; is at the center of this county, although the coastal areas stretch somewhat further north. The mountain ranges &lt;a href=\"Dovrefjell\"&gt;Dovrefjell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trollheimen\"&gt;Trollheimen&lt;/a&gt; are located in the south, while the &lt;a href=\"Fosen\"&gt;Fosen&lt;/a&gt; peninsula is located north of the fjord. The highest mountain is the tall Storskrymten, which is located in the county border between M\u00f8re og Romsdal, Oppland, and Tr\u00f8ndelag. Its longest river is &lt;a href=\"Orkla%20%28river%29\"&gt;Orkla&lt;/a&gt; which runs through Tr\u00f8ndelag and the old county of Hedmark which is now part of &lt;a href=\"Innlandet\"&gt;Innlandet&lt;/a&gt; county.\nSeveral of the best &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; rivers in Europe are located in the county, the largest and most famous being &lt;a href=\"Gaula%20River%20%28S%C3%B8r-Tr%C3%B8ndelag%29\"&gt;Gaula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orkla%20%28river%29\"&gt;Orkla&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dovrefjell%E2%80%93Sunndalsfjella%20National%20Park\"&gt;Dovrefjell\u2013Sunndalsfjella National Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forollhogna%20National%20Park\"&gt;Forollhogna National Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skarvan%20and%20Roltdalen%20National%20Park\"&gt;Skarvan and Roltdalen National Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Femundsmarka%20National%20Park\"&gt;Femundsmarka National Park&lt;/a&gt; are located, or partly located, in the county.\nHistory.\nPeople have lived in this region for thousands of years (see &lt;a href=\"Rock%20carvings%20in%20Central%20Norway\"&gt;Rock carvings in Central Norway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"N%C3%B8stvet%20and%20Lihult%20cultures\"&gt;N\u00f8stvet and Lihult cultures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Corded%20Ware%20culture\"&gt;Corded Ware culture&lt;/a&gt;). The fertile lowland bordering the Trondheimsfjord was probably the most important power centre in the &lt;a href=\"Viking%20Age\"&gt;Viking Age&lt;/a&gt;. Oretinget was an assembly hall located alongside the Nid River in Trondheim that served as the coronation place for Viking kings such as &lt;a href=\"Harald%20Fairhair\"&gt;Harald Fairhair&lt;/a&gt; (865 to 933 AD) and his son &lt;a href=\"Haakon%20I%20the%20Good\"&gt;Haakon I the Good&lt;/a&gt;. Nidaros (the former name of Trondheim) served as Norway's capital during the Viking era up until the early part of the 13th century.\nTrondheim was the seat of the archbishop for several centuries, and an important pilgrimage destination following the death of St Olav in 1030.\n&lt;a href=\"R%C3%B8ros\"&gt;R\u00f8ros&lt;/a&gt;, in the southeastern part of the county, is a well-preserved mining town on a mountain plateau, and is a Unesco &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomy.\nMining in R\u00f8ros and L\u00f8kken in &lt;a href=\"Meldal\"&gt;Meldal&lt;/a&gt; lasted for about 300 years, and &lt;a href=\"Thamshavnbanen\"&gt;Thamshavnbanen&lt;/a&gt;, the old electric railway from &lt;a href=\"Orkdal\"&gt;Orkdal&lt;/a&gt; to L\u00f8kken, is still usable. The constant fires used to crack the rock in the mines demanded vast amounts of firewood; the montane forests on the mountain plateau near R\u00f8ros still have not fully recovered. Along the coast, fishing has always been important. Farming was and still is important in the whole county, with the most economical important agriculture taking place in the fertile lowland valleys, such as in &lt;a href=\"Melhus\"&gt;Melhus&lt;/a&gt;, Orkdal, &lt;a href=\"Skaun\"&gt;Skaun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Midtre%20Gauldal\"&gt;Midtre Gauldal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malvik\"&gt;Malvik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trondheim\"&gt;Trondheim&lt;/a&gt;, but also near the outer seaboard, such as in &lt;a href=\"%C3%98rland\"&gt;\u00d8rland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rissa%2C%20Norway\"&gt;Rissa&lt;/a&gt;. The city of Trondheim has always been at the centre of this area, with administrative functions, as well as industry based on agricultural produce, and more recently education, high-tech business and healthcare.\nTransportation.\nS\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag is connected to the other counties by the &lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E06\"&gt;European Route 6&lt;/a&gt; (E6) which passes by Trondheim and connects Oslo in the south and runs north along the coast and terminates just east of &lt;a href=\"Kirkenes\"&gt;Kirkenes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Finnmark\"&gt;Finnmark&lt;/a&gt;. European route &lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E39\"&gt;E39&lt;/a&gt; connects S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag to M\u00f8re og Romsdal.\nThere are two airports in S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag: R\u00f8ros airport and \u00d8rland airport. Trondheim's airport, V\u00e6rnes, is actually located in Stj\u00f8rdal in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag.\nThere are local trains that connect several municipalities; there are also trains that connect Trondheim to Oslo, Bod\u00f8, R\u00f8ros, and &lt;a href=\"Steinkjer\"&gt;Steinkjer&lt;/a&gt; in Norway, as well as &lt;a href=\"Storlien\"&gt;Storlien&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hurtigruten\"&gt;Hurtigruten's&lt;/a&gt; coastal liner has daily, early- to mid-morning stops in Trondheim on both north- and south-bound trips. There are also frequent commuter boats that connect smaller communities including some that connect Trondheim to Vanviken as well as other ports of call including: Brekstad; Kj\u00f8rsvikbugen; Volden, &lt;a href=\"Hitra\"&gt;Hitra&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Kristiansund\"&gt;Kristiansund&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, during the summer months larger cruise ships stop in Trondheim.\nClimate.\nThe weather is very much decided by the direction of the wind; southerlies and easterlies bring sunny weather, while westerlies bring precipitation with mild weather in winter and cool rainy weather in summer. Northwesterlies bring the worst weather with snow in winter (often sleet or rain on the coast). Average yearly precipitation varies from 2,000\u00a0mm in some areas of &lt;a href=\"Fosen\"&gt;Fosen&lt;/a&gt;, to 850\u00a0mm in Trondheim and only 500\u00a0mm in Oppdal.\nThe interior areas at somewhat higher elevations have cold winters with reliable &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; cover, while the coastal areas have a &lt;a href=\"maritime%20climate\"&gt;maritime climate&lt;/a&gt; with mild and more windy winters. Sula in &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%B8ya%2C%20S%C3%B8r-Tr%C3%B8ndelag\"&gt;Fr\u00f8ya&lt;/a&gt; municipality has an average of 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C (34\u00a0\u00b0F) in the coldest month. R\u00f8ros, at an altitude of 628\u00a0m (2,000\u00a0ft), has a January average of -11.2\u00a0\u00b0C (12\u00a0\u00b0F; Summer temperatures do not differ that much; sheltered lowlands a bit inland will have the warmest summers. \"Base period 1961-1990.\""
