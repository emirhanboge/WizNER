    "text": "The Newark and Passaic Railway was incorporated on Nov 22, 1889 by the &lt;a href=\"Lehigh%20Valley%20Railroad\"&gt;Lehigh Valley Railroad&lt;/a&gt; (LVRR). It was chartered as a short line in &lt;a href=\"Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Newark, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Passaic%20River\"&gt;Passaic River&lt;/a&gt; to a connection with the LVRR's &lt;a href=\"Newark%20and%20Roselle%20Railway\"&gt;Newark and Roselle Railway&lt;/a&gt; near Pennsylvania Avenue in Newark. The lower mile of its length closed a gap in the route of the LVRR from &lt;a href=\"South%20Plainfield%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;South Plainfield&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Jersey City&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 1891 the LVRR consolidated the railroads along the Jersey City route into the &lt;a href=\"Lehigh%20Valley%20Terminal%20Railway\"&gt;Lehigh Valley Terminal Railway&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the Newark and Passaic the other consolidated companies were the &lt;a href=\"Roselle%20and%20South%20Plainfield%20Railway\"&gt;Roselle and South Plainfield Railway&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Newark%20and%20Roselle%20Railway\"&gt;Newark and Roselle Railway&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Newark%20Railway\"&gt;Newark Railway&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jersey%20City%2C%20Newark%2C%20and%20Western%20Railway\"&gt;Jersey City, Newark, and Western Railway&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jersey%20City%20Terminal%20Railway\"&gt;Jersey City Terminal Railway&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Edgewater%20Railway\"&gt;Edgewater Railway&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter consolidation, the upper portion of the line served as the Newark and Passaic Branch of the LVRR, running from the west end of Oak Island yard to Hamburg Place."
