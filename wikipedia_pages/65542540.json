Completed and commissioned in August 1945 on the day before hostilities ended in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, she surrendered in September 1945 and was &lt;a href=\"Scuttling\"&gt;scuttled&lt;/a&gt; in April 1946.\nDesign and description.\nAt the end of 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided it needed large numbers of high-speed coastal submarines to defend the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Archipelago\"&gt;Japanese Home Islands&lt;/a&gt; against an anticipated &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; invasion (named &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Downfall\"&gt;Operation Downfall&lt;/a&gt; by the Allies). To meet this requirement, the \"Ha-201\"-class submarines were designed as small, fast submarines incorporating many of the same advanced ideas implemented in the German &lt;a href=\"Type%20XXI%20submarine\"&gt;Type XXI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Type%20XXIII%20submarine\"&gt;Type XXIII&lt;/a&gt; submarines. They were capable of submerged speeds of almost .\nThe \"Ha-201\" class &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . For surface running, the submarines were powered by a single &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt; that drove one &lt;a href=\"propeller%20shaft\"&gt;propeller shaft&lt;/a&gt;. When submerged the propeller was driven by a &lt;a href=\"electric%20motor\"&gt;electric motor&lt;/a&gt;. They could reach on the surface and submerged. On the surface, the \"Ha-201\"-class submarines had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . Their armament consisted of two &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s with four &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es and a single mount for a 7.7-millimeter &lt;a href=\"machine%20gun\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction and commissioning.\n\"Ha-207\" was &lt;a href=\"Keel-laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 23 April 1945 by the &lt;a href=\"Sasebo%20Naval%20Arsenal\"&gt;Sasebo Naval Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sasebo\"&gt;Sasebo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, as Submarine No. 4917. She was renamed Ha-207 on 1 May 1945 and was attached provisionally to the &lt;a href=\"Sasebo%20Naval%20District\"&gt;Sasebo Naval District&lt;/a&gt; that day. She was &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously with her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt; on 26 May 1945 and was completed and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 14\u00a0August\u00a01945.\nService history.\nUpon commissioning, \"Ha-207\" was attached formally to the Sasebo Naval District and assigned to Submarine Division 52. On 15 August 1945 \u2014 the day after \"Ha-207\" was commissioned \u2014 hostilities between Japan and the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allies&lt;/a&gt; ended. She surrendered to the Allies at Sasebo on 2 September 1945.\nDisposal.\nThe Japanese struck \"Ha-205\" from the Navy list on 30 November 1945. She was &lt;a href=\"scuttling\"&gt;scuttled&lt;/a&gt; along with the submarines , , , , , , and off &lt;a href=\"Sasebo%20Bay\"&gt;Sasebo Bay&lt;/a&gt; on 5\u00a0April\u00a01946."
