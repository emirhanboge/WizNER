When they come to Bishop's Valley, Harper convinces the members of the wagon train to stay in the valley. When Bannon tries to warn them of his half-brother he is forced out of the camp with a gun to his back by Harper and his gang. Harper and his gang try to drag the settlers into a land war, but ultimately Bannon outsmarts them. In the fighting Bannon's brother, the original white settler in the valley, dies redeeming himself for a lifetime of hating his brother. The settlers stay, and Bannon gets the girl."
