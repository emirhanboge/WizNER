In terms of population, the city of Concord is the second-largest city in the &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Charlotte metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; and is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20municipalities%20in%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;10th most populous city&lt;/a&gt; in North Carolina.\nIn 2015, &lt;a href=\"WalletHub\"&gt;WalletHub&lt;/a&gt; ranked Concord as the city with the 16th fastest growing economy in the United States. The city was a winner of the &lt;a href=\"All-America%20City%20Award\"&gt;All-America City Award&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. Located near the center of Cabarrus County in the &lt;a href=\"Piedmont%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Piedmont region&lt;/a&gt;, it is northeast of &lt;a href=\"Uptown%20Charlotte\"&gt;Uptown Charlotte&lt;/a&gt;. Concord is the home to some of North Carolina's top tourist destinations, including NASCAR's &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Charlotte Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Concord%20Mills\"&gt;Concord Mills&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nConcord, located in today's rapidly growing northeast quadrant of the &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Charlotte metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;, was first settled about 1750 by German and &lt;a href=\"Scotch-Irish%20Americans\"&gt;Scots-Irish&lt;/a&gt; immigrants. The name Concord means with harmony. This name was chosen after a lengthy dispute between the German Lutherans and Scotch-Irish Presbyterians over where the county seat should be located. Concord is considered a relatively old town by US standards, as it was incorporated in 1806. Today, markers identifying the original town limits can be seen in the downtown area.\nAs county seat, Concord became a center of trade and retail for the cotton-producing region, especially on court days. The downtown would be crowded with farmers and townfolk, in addition to lawyers and their clients. During the antebellum era, wealth was built by planters through the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop; the work was done by enslaved African Americans.\nBased on wealth from cotton as a commodity crop and through textile manufacturing, Concord's white planters and business owners built some significant homes in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; they range along North and South Union Street and Edgewood Avenue. Within the North Union Historic District is Memorial Garden. Located on , the garden winds through the 200-year-old cemetery of the First Presbyterian Church.\nLocated in the Piedmont, Concord became a site of industrialization with cotton mills in the late 19th century. Among the owners of the new mills in the area were men of the rising black middle-class in &lt;a href=\"Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Wilmington, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Clay%20Coleman\"&gt;Warren Clay Coleman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20C.%20Dancy\"&gt;John C. Dancy&lt;/a&gt; (appointed as collector of customs at the port), and others, who organized &lt;a href=\"Coleman%20Manufacturing%20Company\"&gt;Coleman Manufacturing Company&lt;/a&gt; in 1897. They built and operated what is believed to have been the first cotton mill owned by blacks in the nation. They hoped to promote economic security for people of color. However, the &lt;a href=\"Wilmington%20Insurrection%20of%201898\"&gt;Wilmington Insurrection of 1898&lt;/a&gt;, with white attacks on black areas of the city, caused many deaths, as well as destroying homes and businesses built by blacks since the Civil War. In 1900, Dancy was among more than 2000 blacks who left the city permanently after the riot. He moved to Washington, DC, appointed as the federal Recorder of Deeds, and serving until 1910. The mill operated under black ownership through 1904, hitting difficult times after Coleman died. The brick mill building was later taken over by &lt;a href=\"Fieldcrest%20Cannon\"&gt;Fieldcrest Cannon&lt;/a&gt;. It was enlarged and added on to, nearly doubling its square footage.\nFrom the time of incorporation in the late 1700s through the 1970s, Concord's jurisdiction was centered around the downtown area. Since then, most annexations have taken place west of the center-city area toward Charlotte. Portions of the city limit boundary adjoin the Cabarrus/Mecklenburg County line.\nNational Register of Historic Places.\nIn addition to the Cabarrus County Courthouse, the &lt;a href=\"Barber-Scotia%20College\"&gt;Barber-Scotia College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boger-Hartsell%20Farm\"&gt;Boger-Hartsell Farm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"McCurdy%20Log%20House\"&gt;McCurdy Log House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mill%20Hill%20%28Concord%2C%20North%20Carolina%29\"&gt;Mill Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Union%20Street%20Historic%20District\"&gt;North Union Street Historic District&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Odell-Locke-Randolph%20Cotton%20Mill\"&gt;Odell-Locke-Randolph Cotton Mill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reed%20Gold%20Mine\"&gt;Reed Gold Mine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Union%20Street%20Courthouse%20and%20Commercial%20Historic%20District\"&gt;South Union Street Courthouse and Commercial Historic District&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Union%20Street%20Historic%20District%20%28Concord%2C%20North%20Carolina%29\"&gt;South Union Street Historic District&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spears%20House%20%28Concord%2C%20North%20Carolina%29\"&gt;Spears House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonewall%20Jackson%20Youth%20Development%20Center\"&gt;Stonewall Jackson Training School Historic District&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Union%20Street%20North-Cabarrus%20Avenue%20Commercial%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Union Street North-Cabarrus Avenue Commercial Historic District&lt;/a&gt; are listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nConcord is located in western Cabarrus County at (35.404340, -80.600474).
