    "text": "The Silurian ( ) is a &lt;a href=\"period%20%28geology%29\"&gt;geologic period and system&lt;/a&gt; spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the &lt;a href=\"Ordovician\"&gt;Ordovician&lt;/a&gt; Period, at million years ago (&lt;a href=\"annum\"&gt;Mya&lt;/a&gt;), to the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Devonian\"&gt;Devonian&lt;/a&gt; Period, Mya. The Silurian is the shortest period of the &lt;a href=\"Paleozoic\"&gt;Paleozoic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Era%20%28geology%29\"&gt;Era&lt;/a&gt;. As with other &lt;a href=\"Geology\"&gt;geologic&lt;/a&gt; periods, the &lt;a href=\"Rock%20%28geology%29\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by a few million years. The base of the Silurian is set at a series of major &lt;a href=\"Ordovician%E2%80%93Silurian%20extinction%20events\"&gt;Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction events&lt;/a&gt; when up to 60% of marine genera were wiped out.\nOne important event in this period was the initial establishment of terrestrial life: &lt;a href=\"vascular%20plants\"&gt;vascular plants&lt;/a&gt; emerged from more primitive land plants, &lt;a href=\"dikarya\"&gt;dikarya&lt;/a&gt;n fungi started expanding and diversifying along with &lt;a href=\"glomeromycota\"&gt;glomeromycota&lt;/a&gt;n fungi, and 3 groups of arthropods (&lt;a href=\"myriapods\"&gt;myriapods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"arachnids\"&gt;arachnids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hexapoda\"&gt;hexapods&lt;/a&gt;) became fully terrestrialized.\nA significant evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of &lt;a href=\"Gnathostomata\"&gt;jawed fish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bony%20fish\"&gt;bony fish&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory of study.\nThe Silurian system was first identified by British geologist &lt;a href=\"Roderick%20Murchison\"&gt;Roderick Murchison&lt;/a&gt;, who was examining fossil-bearing sedimentary rock &lt;a href=\"Stratum\"&gt;strata&lt;/a&gt; in south &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1830s. He named the sequences for a &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; tribe of Wales, the &lt;a href=\"Silures\"&gt;Silures&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by his friend &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Sedgwick\"&gt;Adam Sedgwick&lt;/a&gt;, who had named the period of his study the &lt;a href=\"Cambrian\"&gt;Cambrian&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; name for Wales. This naming does not indicate any correlation between the occurrence of the Silurian rocks and the land inhabited by the Silures (&lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Acf\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. , ). In 1835 the two men presented a joint paper, under the title \"On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, Exhibiting the Order in which the Older Sedimentary Strata Succeed each other in England and Wales,\" which was the germ of the modern &lt;a href=\"Geologic%20time%20scale\"&gt;geological time scale&lt;/a&gt;. As it was first identified, the \"Silurian\" series when traced farther afield quickly came to overlap Sedgwick's \"Cambrian\" sequence, however, provoking furious disagreements that ended the friendship.\n&lt;a href=\"Charles%20Lapworth\"&gt;Charles Lapworth&lt;/a&gt; resolved the conflict by defining a new &lt;a href=\"Ordovician\"&gt;Ordovician&lt;/a&gt; system including the contested beds. An alternative name for the Silurian was \"Gotlandian\" after the &lt;a href=\"Geology%20of%20Gotland\"&gt;strata of the Baltic island of Gotland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe French geologist &lt;a href=\"Joachim%20Barrande\"&gt;Joachim Barrande&lt;/a&gt;, building on Murchison's work, used the term \"Silurian\" in a more comprehensive sense than was justified by subsequent knowledge. He divided the Silurian rocks of &lt;a href=\"Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; into eight stages. His interpretation was questioned in 1854 by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Forbes\"&gt;Edward Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, and the later stages of Barrande; F, G and H have since been shown to be Devonian. Despite these modifications in the original groupings of the strata, it is recognized that Barrande established Bohemia as a classic ground for the study of the earliest Silurian fossils.\nSubdivisions.\nLlandovery.\nThe Llandovery &lt;a href=\"Epoch%20%28geology%29\"&gt;Epoch&lt;/a&gt; lasted from mya, and is subdivided into three &lt;a href=\"Stage%20%28stratigraphy%29\"&gt;stages&lt;/a&gt;: the , lasting until , the , lasting to , and the . The epoch is named for the town of &lt;a href=\"Llandovery\"&gt;Llandovery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Carmarthenshire\"&gt;Carmarthenshire&lt;/a&gt;, Wales.\nWenlock.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wenlock%20%28Silurian%29\"&gt;Wenlock&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted from mya, is subdivided into the (to ) and ages. It is named after &lt;a href=\"Wenlock%20Edge\"&gt;Wenlock Edge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shropshire\"&gt;Shropshire&lt;/a&gt;, England. During the Wenlock, the oldest-known &lt;a href=\"Vascular%20plant\"&gt;tracheophytes&lt;/a&gt; of the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Cooksonia\"&gt;Cooksonia&lt;/a&gt;\", appear. The complexity of slightly later &lt;a href=\"Gondwana\"&gt;Gondwana&lt;/a&gt; plants like \"&lt;a href=\"Baragwanathia\"&gt;Baragwanathia&lt;/a&gt;\", which resembled a modern clubmoss, indicates a much longer history for vascular plants, extending into the early Silurian or even &lt;a href=\"Ordovician\"&gt;Ordovician&lt;/a&gt;. The first terrestrial animals also appear in the Wenlock, represented by air-breathing &lt;a href=\"millipedes\"&gt;millipedes&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.\nLudlow.\nThe Ludlow lasted from mya. It is named for the town of &lt;a href=\"Ludlow\"&gt;Ludlow&lt;/a&gt; in Shropshire, England. The Ludlow comprises the stage (lasting until ) and the stage (named for &lt;a href=\"Ludford%2C%20Shropshire\"&gt;Ludford&lt;/a&gt;, also in Shropshire).\nP\u0159\u00eddol\u00ed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"P%C5%99%C3%ADdol%C3%AD%20Epoch\"&gt;P\u0159\u00eddol\u00ed Epoch&lt;/a&gt;, lasting from mya, is the final and shortest epoch of the Silurian. It is named after one locality at the \"Homolka a P\u0159\u00eddol\u00ed\" nature reserve near the &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; suburb &lt;a href=\"Slivenec\"&gt;Slivenec&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;. \"P\u0159\u00eddol\u00ed\" is the old name of a &lt;a href=\"Cadastre\"&gt;cadastral&lt;/a&gt; field area.\nPaleogeography.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"supercontinent\"&gt;supercontinent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gondwana\"&gt;Gondwana&lt;/a&gt; covering the equator and much of the southern hemisphere, a large ocean occupied most of the northern half of the globe. The high sea levels of the Silurian and the relatively flat land (with few significant mountain belts) resulted in a number of island chains, and thus a rich diversity of environmental settings.\nDuring the Silurian, Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian icecaps were less extensive than those of the late-Ordovician glaciation. The southern continents remained united during this period. The melting of icecaps and &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt;s contributed to a rise in sea level, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an &lt;a href=\"unconformity\"&gt;unconformity&lt;/a&gt;. The continents of &lt;a href=\"Avalonia\"&gt;Avalonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baltica\"&gt;Baltica&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Laurentia\"&gt;Laurentia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Continental%20drift\"&gt;drifted&lt;/a&gt; together near the &lt;a href=\"equator\"&gt;equator&lt;/a&gt;, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as &lt;a href=\"Euramerica\"&gt;Euramerica&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the proto-Europe collided with North America, the collision folded coastal sediments that had been accumulating since the Cambrian off the east coast of North America and the west coast of Europe. This event is the &lt;a href=\"Caledonian%20orogeny\"&gt;Caledonian orogeny&lt;/a&gt;, a spate of mountain building that stretched from &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York State&lt;/a&gt; through conjoined Europe and Greenland to Norway. At the end of the Silurian, sea levels dropped again, leaving telltale basins of &lt;a href=\"evaporite\"&gt;evaporite&lt;/a&gt;s extending from Michigan to West Virginia, and the new mountain ranges were rapidly eroded. The &lt;a href=\"Teays%20River\"&gt;Teays River&lt;/a&gt;, flowing into the shallow mid-continental sea, eroded Ordovician Period strata, forming deposits of Silurian strata in northern Ohio and Indiana.\nThe vast ocean of &lt;a href=\"Panthalassa\"&gt;Panthalassa&lt;/a&gt; covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include two phases of the Tethys, the &lt;a href=\"Proto-Tethys%20Ocean\"&gt;Proto-Tethys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paleo-Tethys%20Ocean\"&gt;Paleo-Tethys&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rheic%20Ocean\"&gt;Rheic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Iapetus%20Ocean\"&gt;Iapetus Ocean&lt;/a&gt; (a narrow seaway between Avalonia and Laurentia), and the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Ural%20Ocean\"&gt;Ural Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate and sea level.\nThe Silurian Period enjoyed relatively stable and warm temperatures, in contrast with the extreme glaciations of the Ordovician before it, and the extreme heat of the ensuing Devonian. Sea levels rose from their &lt;a href=\"Hirnantian\"&gt;Hirnantian&lt;/a&gt; low throughout the first half of the Silurian; they subsequently fell throughout the rest of the period, although smaller scale patterns are superimposed on this general trend; fifteen high-stands (periods when sea levels were above the edge of the continental shelf) can be identified, and the highest Silurian sea level was probably around 140\u00a0m higher than the lowest level reached.\nDuring this period, the &lt;a href=\"Earth\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; entered a long, warm &lt;a href=\"greenhouse\"&gt;greenhouse&lt;/a&gt; phase, supported by high CO2 levels of 4500 ppm, and warm shallow seas covered much of the equatorial land masses. Early in the Silurian, &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt;s retreated back into the &lt;a href=\"South%20Pole\"&gt;South Pole&lt;/a&gt; until they almost disappeared in the middle of Silurian. The period witnessed a relative stabilization of the Earth's general climate, ending the previous pattern of erratic climatic fluctuations. Layers of broken shells (called &lt;a href=\"coquina\"&gt;coquina&lt;/a&gt;) provide strong evidence of a climate dominated by violent storms generated then as now by warm sea surfaces. Later in the Silurian, the climate cooled slightly, but closer to the Silurian-Devonian boundary, the climate became warmer.\nPerturbations.\nThe climate and &lt;a href=\"carbon%20cycle\"&gt;carbon cycle&lt;/a&gt; appear to be rather unsettled during the Silurian, which had a higher concentration of isotopic excursions than any other period. The &lt;a href=\"Ireviken%20event\"&gt;Ireviken event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulde%20event\"&gt;Mulde event&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lau%20event\"&gt;Lau event&lt;/a&gt; each represent isotopic excursions following a minor mass extinction and associated with rapid sea-level change. Each one leaves a similar signature in the geological record, both geochemically and biologically; pelagic (free-swimming) organisms were particularly hard hit, as were &lt;a href=\"brachiopods\"&gt;brachiopods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"corals\"&gt;corals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trilobites\"&gt;trilobites&lt;/a&gt;, and extinctions rarely occur in a rapid series of fast bursts.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe Silurian was the first period to see megafossils of extensive terrestrial biota, in the form of &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;-like miniature forests along lakes and streams. However, the land fauna did not have a major impact on the Earth until it diversified in the Devonian.\nThe first fossil records of &lt;a href=\"vascular%20plant\"&gt;vascular plant&lt;/a&gt;s, that is, land plants with tissues that carry water and food, appeared in the second half of the Silurian Period. The earliest-known representatives of this group are \"&lt;a href=\"Cooksonia\"&gt;Cooksonia&lt;/a&gt;\". Most of the sediments containing \"Cooksonia\" are marine in nature. Preferred habitats were likely along rivers and streams. \"&lt;a href=\"Baragwanathia\"&gt;Baragwanathia&lt;/a&gt;\" appears to be almost as old, dating to the early Ludlow (420 million years) and has branching stems and needle-like leaves of 10\u201320\u00a0cm. The plant shows a high degree of development in relation to the age of its fossil remains. Fossils of this plant have been recorded in Australia, Canada, and China. \"&lt;a href=\"Eohostimella\"&gt;Eohostimella&lt;/a&gt; heathana\" is an early, probably terrestrial, \"plant\" known from compression fossils of Early Silurian (Llandovery) age. The chemistry of its fossils is similar to that of fossilised vascular plants, rather than algae.\nThe first bony fish, the &lt;a href=\"Osteichthyes\"&gt;Osteichthyes&lt;/a&gt;, appeared, represented by the &lt;a href=\"Acanthodii\"&gt;Acanthodians&lt;/a&gt; covered with bony scales. Fish reached considerable diversity and developed movable &lt;a href=\"jaw\"&gt;jaw&lt;/a&gt;s, adapted from the supports of the front two or three &lt;a href=\"gill\"&gt;gill&lt;/a&gt; arches. A diverse fauna of &lt;a href=\"eurypterid\"&gt;eurypterid&lt;/a&gt;s (sea scorpions)\u2014some of them several meters in length\u2014prowled the shallow Silurian seas of North America; many of their &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s have been found in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York state&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Leech\"&gt;Leech&lt;/a&gt;es also made their appearance during the Silurian Period. Brachiopods, &lt;a href=\"bryozoa\"&gt;bryozoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mollusca\"&gt;molluscs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hederellid\"&gt;hederelloids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tentaculita\"&gt;tentaculitoids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crinoid\"&gt;crinoid&lt;/a&gt;s and trilobites were abundant and diverse. Endobiotic symbionts were common in the corals and stromatoporoids.\nReef abundance was patchy; sometimes, fossils are frequent, but at other points, are virtually absent from the rock record.\nThe earliest-known animals fully adapted to terrestrial conditions appear during the Mid-Silurian, including the millipede \"&lt;a href=\"Pneumodesmus\"&gt;Pneumodesmus&lt;/a&gt;\". Some evidence also suggests the presence of predatory &lt;a href=\"Trigonotarbida\"&gt;trigonotarbid arachnoid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"myriapod\"&gt;myriapod&lt;/a&gt;s in Late Silurian facies. Predatory &lt;a href=\"invertebrate\"&gt;invertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s would indicate that simple &lt;a href=\"food%20web\"&gt;food web&lt;/a&gt;s were in place that included non-predatory prey animals. Extrapolating back from &lt;a href=\"Early%20Devonian\"&gt;Early Devonian&lt;/a&gt; biota, Andrew Jeram \"et al.\" in 1990 suggested a food web based on as-yet-undiscovered &lt;a href=\"detritivore\"&gt;detritivore&lt;/a&gt;s and grazers on micro-organisms."
