    "text": "The Miccosukee Indian Reservation is the homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Miccosukee\"&gt;Miccosukee&lt;/a&gt; tribe of &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt;. It is divided into three sections in two counties of southern &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, United States. Their total land area is 128.256 sq mi (332.183\u00a0km2). The Miccosukee Reservation have members living on and off the reservation.\nThe largest section by far is known as the Alligator Alley Reservation, which is located at the extreme western part of &lt;a href=\"Broward%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Broward County&lt;/a&gt;, at its &lt;a href=\"border\"&gt;county line&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Collier%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Collier County&lt;/a&gt;. It has a land area of 127.057 sq mi (329.076\u00a0km2).\nThe second largest section is the Tamiami Trail Reservation, which is located west of &lt;a href=\"Miami%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Tamiami%20Trail\"&gt;Tamiami Trail&lt;/a&gt; (U.S. Route 41, or Southwest 8th Street), at the point where the &lt;a href=\"Tamiami%20Canal\"&gt;Tamiami Canal&lt;/a&gt; turns to the northwest, in western &lt;a href=\"Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Miami-Dade County&lt;/a&gt;. Although this section is much smaller than the Alligator Alley section, it is the center of most tribal operations. It has a land area of 712.64 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s (2.884\u00a0km2).\nThe smallest section is the Krome Avenue Reservation, located east of the Tamiami Trail section and closer to the city of Miami. It is also on the Tamiami Trail, on the northwest corner of its intersection with &lt;a href=\"State%20Road%20997%20%28Florida%29\"&gt;Krome Avenue&lt;/a&gt; (Southwest 177th Avenue), just west of the community of &lt;a href=\"Tamiami%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Tamiami&lt;/a&gt;. This section has a land area of only 55.04 acres (0.2227\u00a0km2). The Miccosukee Resort &amp; Casino is on this site."
