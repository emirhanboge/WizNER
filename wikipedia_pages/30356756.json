    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20mythology\"&gt;Japanese mythology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20folklore\"&gt;folklore&lt;/a&gt;, Somin Sh\u014drai (\u8607\u6c11\u5c06\u6765, \"&lt;a href=\"ky%C5%ABjitai\"&gt;ky\u016bjitai&lt;/a&gt;\": \u8607\u6c11\u5c07\u4f86; also &lt;a href=\"Variant%20Chinese%20character\"&gt;written as&lt;/a&gt; \u8613\u6c11\u5c07\u8012) was a poor man who gave food and shelter to a certain &lt;a href=\"Kami\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; in the guise of a traveler who was looking for a place to stay. As a reward, the god provided Somin Sh\u014drai's family a means to save themselves from an oncoming pestilence that eventually claimed the lives of those who had turned him away earlier. The story of Somin Sh\u014drai is the basis for the &lt;a href=\"Shinto\"&gt;Shinto&lt;/a&gt; custom of walking through a large ring of twisted &lt;a href=\"miscanthus\"&gt;miscanthus&lt;/a&gt; reeds during the beginning of summer at many &lt;a href=\"Shinto%20shrine\"&gt;Shinto shrine&lt;/a&gt;s across Japan. &lt;a href=\"Omamori\"&gt;Talismans&lt;/a&gt; bearing Somin Sh\u014drai's name are also popularly held to ward off disease and misfortune.\nLegend.\nThe earliest version of the Somin Sh\u014drai legend is found in the imperially commissioned gazetteer (\"&lt;a href=\"Fudoki\"&gt;Fudoki&lt;/a&gt;\") of &lt;a href=\"Bingo%20Province\"&gt;Bingo Province&lt;/a&gt; (modern eastern &lt;a href=\"Hiroshima%20Prefecture\"&gt;Hiroshima Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;) compiled during the &lt;a href=\"Nara%20period\"&gt;Nara period&lt;/a&gt;, surviving in an extract quoted by medieval scholar and Shinto priest Urabe Kanekata in the \"&lt;a href=\"Shaku%20Nihongi\"&gt;Shaku Nihongi&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAccording to the story, a god from the northern sea named Mut\u014d-no-Kami (\u6b66\u5854\u795e), who was embarking on a long journey to court the daughter of the god of the southern sea, asked for a place to stay for the night from two brothers. While the wealthy younger brother refused the deity, the elder brother named Somin Sh\u014drai, though extremely poor, took him in as a guest and shared all that he had: a bed of &lt;a href=\"Foxtail%20millet\"&gt;millet&lt;/a&gt;-straw and a simple meal of cooked millet. Years later, Mut\u014d (who had since married the southern sea god's daughter and had eight children with her) returned to Somin Sh\u014drai's house and gave Somin Sh\u014drai's daughter a wreath of entwined &lt;a href=\"miscanthus\"&gt;miscanthus&lt;/a&gt; reeds as a reward for the hospitality shown to him by her father, telling her to wear it around her waist. At that same night, the god exterminated all the inhabitants of the land, sparing only Somin Sh\u014drai's daughter. Mut\u014d then revealed himself to be the god &lt;a href=\"Susanoo-no-Mikoto\"&gt;Susanoo&lt;/a&gt; and promised to her that in the future, all those who would wear miscanthus wreaths around their waists while declaring themselves to be Somin Sh\u014drai's descendants in times of epidemics would remain unharmed.\nIn some later versions of the legend, the rich younger brother is given the name Kotan Sh\u014drai (\u5de8\u65e6\u5c06\u6765), while the god who stayed in Somin Sh\u014drai's house is identified as &lt;a href=\"Gozu%20Tenn%C5%8D\"&gt;Gozu Tenn\u014d&lt;/a&gt; (\u725b\u982d\u5929\u738b 'Ox-Headed Heavenly King'), a pestilence deity conflated with both Mut\u014d and Susanoo (though one version instead identifies Gozu Tenn\u014d as Mut\u014d's son). In the version of the story found in the \"\", an &lt;a href=\"Onmy%C5%8Dd%C5%8D\"&gt;Onmy\u014dd\u014d&lt;/a&gt; text on divination attributed to &lt;a href=\"Abe%20no%20Seimei\"&gt;Abe no Seimei&lt;/a&gt;, Kotan Sh\u014drai (portrayed here as the king of an Indian kingdom), who was slain by Gozu Tenn\u014d as punishment for his lack of generosity, is identified with the evil deity &lt;a href=\"Konjin\"&gt;Konjin&lt;/a&gt;. In other variants, the divine traveler gives Somin Sh\u014drai's family a talisman with the inscription \"[I am] the descendant of Somin Sh\u014drai\" (\u8607\u6c11\u5c06\u6765\u4e4b\u5b50\u5b6b\u4e5f, \"Somin Sh\u014drai no shison nari\") as protection against pestilence.\n\"Chi-no-wa kuguri\".\nThe legend forms the basis for the \"chi-no-wa kuguri\" (\u8305\u306e\u8f2a\u304f\u3050\u308a) ritual performed in many &lt;a href=\"Shinto%20shrines\"&gt;Shinto shrines&lt;/a&gt; mainly during the annual Summer Purification Ritual (\u590f\u8d8a\u306e\u7953 \"Nagoshi no &lt;a href=\"Harae\"&gt;Harae&lt;/a&gt;\" or \u590f\u8d8a\u306e\u5927\u7953 \"Nagoshi no \u014charae\") held at the end of June. This rite involves passing through a large miscanthus hoop (\u8305\u306e\u8f2a \"chi-no-wa\") set up at the shrine's entrance or within its precincts, usually while reciting one or more seasonal \"&lt;a href=\"Waka%20%28poetry%29\"&gt;waka&lt;/a&gt;\" such as the one below followed by a double recitation of Somin Sh\u014drai's name. Walking through this ring is believed to cleanse sins and other defilements (\"&lt;a href=\"kegare\"&gt;kegare&lt;/a&gt;\") and guard against misfortune.\nWorship.\nSomin Sh\u014drai is venerated in a few shrines as a deity against disease, such as in Eki Shrine (\u75ab\u795e\u793e \"Eki-jinja\", lit. 'Plague Shrine'), an auxiliary shrine within the precincts of &lt;a href=\"Yasaka%20Shrine\"&gt;Yasaka Shrine&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gion\"&gt;Gion&lt;/a&gt; District of &lt;a href=\"Kyoto\"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe story is also the inspiration for the Somin Festival (\u8607\u6c11\u796d \"Somin-sai\") held in various places within &lt;a href=\"Iwate%20Prefecture\"&gt;Iwate Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;, the most famous of which being the one held every February at in &lt;a href=\"%C5%8Csh%C5%AB%2C%20Iwate\"&gt;\u014csh\u016b City&lt;/a&gt;. In this festival, hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Hadaka%20Matsuri\"&gt;half-naked men&lt;/a&gt; compete to grab the 'Somin bag' (\u8607\u6c11\u888b \"Somin-bukuro\"), which is said to bring good fortune.\nAmulets.\nVarious types of amulets (\"&lt;a href=\"omamori\"&gt;omamori&lt;/a&gt;\") bearing Somin Sh\u014drai's name is distributed by a number of Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples across Japan.\nIn Kyoto, a talisman resembling a \"chimaki\" (a &lt;a href=\"Zongzi\"&gt;rice dumpling&lt;/a&gt; wrapped in bamboo leaves) on which is attached a slip of paper with the words \"The descendant(s) of Somin Sh\u014drai\" (\u8607\u6c11\u5c06\u6765\u4e4b\u5b50\u5b6b\u4e5f, \"Somin Sh\u014drai no shison nari\") is traditionally hung on doorways to ward off misfortune. A similar custom, involving a \"&lt;a href=\"shimenawa\"&gt;shimenawa&lt;/a&gt;\" with a wooden plaque on which is written \"The house of Somin Sh\u014drai's descendants\" (\u8607\u6c11\u5c06\u6765\u5b50\u5b6b\u5bb6\u9580, \"Somin Sh\u014drai shison kamon\"), is practiced in the &lt;a href=\"Ise%2C%20Mie\"&gt;Ise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shima%2C%20Mie\"&gt;Shima&lt;/a&gt; areas of &lt;a href=\"Mie%20Prefecture\"&gt;Mie Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ueda%2C%20Nagano\"&gt;Ueda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nagano%20Prefecture\"&gt;Nagano Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;, hexagonal wooden charms inscribed with the words \"Wealthy [and] prosperous [are] Somin Sh\u014drai's descendant(s)\" (\u5927\u798f\u9577\u8005\u8607\u6c11\u5c06\u6765\u5b50\u5b6b\u4eba\u4e5f, \"Daifuku ch\u014dja Somin Sh\u014drai shison no hito nari\") traditionally handmade by members of the local Somin Confraternity (\u8607\u6c11\u8b1b \"Somin-k\u014d\") are distributed by &lt;a href=\"Shinano%20Kokubun-ji\"&gt;Shinano Kokubun-ji&lt;/a&gt; temple during the Y\u014dkad\u014d Festival (\u516b\u65e5\u5802\u7e01\u65e5 \"Y\u014dkad\u014d Ennichi\") held every 7th-8 January."
