    "text": "Rolando David Z\u00e1rate Riga (born 6 August 1978) is an Argentine former professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; who played as a &lt;a href=\"centre%20forward\"&gt;centre forward&lt;/a&gt;, and is a &lt;a href=\"sports%20agent\"&gt;sports agent&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Haedo%2C%20Buenos%20Aires%20Province\"&gt;Haedo, Buenos Aires Province&lt;/a&gt;, Z\u00e1rate spent most of his career for &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20V%C3%A9lez%20Sarsfield\"&gt;Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez Sarsfield&lt;/a&gt;, representing the club in two different spells. He made his professional debut in 1997, playing in only 17 &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; games in his first two seasons combined.\nZ\u00e1rate moved to Spain in 1998, going on to remain in that country for the following four years, always on loan: he started out at &lt;a href=\"Terrassa%20FC\"&gt;Terrassa FC&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B\"&gt;third division&lt;/a&gt;, joining &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20Castilla\"&gt;Real Madrid Castilla&lt;/a&gt; in the same level the following year. His impressive scoring form prompted &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; boss &lt;a href=\"Vicente%20del%20Bosque\"&gt;Vicente del Bosque&lt;/a&gt; to promote him to the main squad, and he scored three official goals for them (one in &lt;a href=\"La%20Liga\"&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt; and two in the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;Copa del Rey&lt;/a&gt;); between 2001 and 2002 he represented &lt;a href=\"Ciudad%20de%20Murcia\"&gt;Ciudad de Murcia&lt;/a&gt; and its neighbours &lt;a href=\"Real%20Murcia\"&gt;Real Murcia&lt;/a&gt;, respectively in divisions three and &lt;a href=\"Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;.\nZ\u00e1rate played with &lt;a href=\"Livingston%20F.C.\"&gt;Livingston&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2002\u201303 season&lt;/a&gt;, still owned by V\u00e9lez. He netted twice on his debut in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Scottish Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, a 3\u20132 home win against &lt;a href=\"Motherwell%20F.C.\"&gt;Motherwell&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually proved instrumental as the \"Livi Lions\" retained their division status.\nZ\u00e1rate's last loan would be with &lt;a href=\"Ittihad%20FC\"&gt;Ittihad FC&lt;/a&gt; in Saudi Arabia. Again with V\u00e9lez, he scored 13 times in the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20Argentine%20football\"&gt;2004 Clausura Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, adding eight in &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20Argentine%20football\"&gt;the following year's Apertura&lt;/a&gt;. In the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Apertura%20and%20Clausura\"&gt;Clausura&lt;/a&gt;, \"Roly\" netted seven goals as his team won the national championship for the first time in seven years.\nIn the following years, Z\u00e1rate played in Mexico for two teams, also representing &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate\"&gt;Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate&lt;/a&gt; without any impact. On 25 July 2009, he re-signed with V\u00e9lez on a &lt;a href=\"Free%20transfer%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;free transfer&lt;/a&gt; after a period of trial, from Ecuador's &lt;a href=\"Barcelona%20Sporting%20Club\"&gt;Barcelona Sporting Club&lt;/a&gt;, but was released during that year due to injury to his &lt;a href=\"spinal%20cord\"&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt;; he returned to training in early 2010 and, eventually, signed a new one-year deal.\nFor &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20season\"&gt;2010\u201311&lt;/a&gt;, 32-year-old Z\u00e1rate joined &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Hurac%C3%A1n\"&gt;Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; in the top flight, for free. At the end of the campaign, the side were tied with &lt;a href=\"Gimnasia%20y%20Esgrima%20de%20La%20Plata\"&gt;Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata&lt;/a&gt; for the second-to-last position in the relegation ranking, and thus needed to play a tiebreaker, losing it 2\u20130.\nFollowing Hurac\u00e1n's relegation, Z\u00e1rate's contract at the &lt;a href=\"Parque%20Patricios\"&gt;Parque Patricios&lt;/a&gt; ended and he signed with another club in the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;second division&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defensa%20y%20Justicia\"&gt;Defensa y Justicia&lt;/a&gt;, again on a free transfer. After his retirement he became a &lt;a href=\"Sports%20agent\"&gt;football agent&lt;/a&gt;, representing &lt;a href=\"Maximiliano%20Romero\"&gt;Maximiliano Romero&lt;/a&gt; among others and arranging his December 2017 transfer of Romero from V\u00e9lez to &lt;a href=\"PSV%20Eindhoven\"&gt;PSV Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nZ\u00e1rate made his debut for &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; on 9 March 2005, a &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20game\"&gt;friendly match&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in which the former only fielded players from the domestic league. He scored in a 1\u20131 draw, in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso in that year, Z\u00e1rate made his second and last appearance, playing 15 minutes in a 2\u20131 win in &lt;a href=\"Bolivia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28CONMEBOL%29\"&gt;qualifiers&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nZ\u00e1rate has three brothers, all footballers: younger &lt;a href=\"Mauro%20Z%C3%A1rate\"&gt;Mauro&lt;/a&gt; and older &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Z%C3%A1rate\"&gt;Sergio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ariel%20Z%C3%A1rate\"&gt;Ariel&lt;/a&gt;, with the first two eventually representing the Argentina national team. Rolando's son, &lt;a href=\"Tob%C3%ADas%20Z%C3%A1rate\"&gt;Tob\u00edas&lt;/a&gt;, also became a professional footballer.\nHonours.\nV\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield\nIndividual"
