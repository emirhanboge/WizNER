Amongst their major titles are 20 &lt;a href=\"Super%20League%20Greece\"&gt;Greek Championships&lt;/a&gt;, 18 &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Football%20Cup\"&gt;Greek Cups&lt;/a&gt;, achieving eight times the &lt;a href=\"Double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;Double&lt;/a&gt;, and 3 &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;Greek Super Cup&lt;/a&gt;s. They are also one of the two clubs that won a championship &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20unbeaten%20football%20club%20seasons\"&gt;undefeated&lt;/a&gt;, going without a loss in a top-flight campaign in the &lt;a href=\"1963%E2%80%9364%20Alpha%20Ethniki\"&gt;1963\u201364 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nPanathinaikos is also the most successful Greek club in terms of achievements in the European competitions. It is the only Greek team that has reached the European Cup (later renamed &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;) final in 1971 (which they lost to &lt;a href=\"Ajax%20Amsterdam\"&gt;Ajax Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20130), and also the semi-finals twice, in 1985 and 1996. It is also the only Greek team that has played for the &lt;a href=\"Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29\"&gt;Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt; (1971). Furthermore, they have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League on another two occasions (in 1992 and 2002), as well as the quarter-finals of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; twice (1988 and 2003). They have also won the &lt;a href=\"Balkans%20Cup\"&gt;Balkans Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1977. Panathinaikos is a member of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Club%20Association\"&gt;European Club Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the 1950s, the club maintains some of the oldest and most successful &lt;a href=\"Panathinaikos%20F.C.%20Academy\"&gt;academies&lt;/a&gt; in Greece, producing talent for the first team and feeding the &lt;a href=\"Greece%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Greek national football team&lt;/a&gt;. They have played their home games in the &lt;a href=\"Apostolos%20Nikolaidis%20Stadium\"&gt;Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, considered their traditional home ground, and the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Athens%29\"&gt;Athens Olympic Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to researches and polls, Panathinaikos is one of the two most popular football teams in Greece.\nThey hold a long-term rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Olympiacos%20F.C.\"&gt;Olympiacos&lt;/a&gt;, the clash between the two teams being referred to as the \"&lt;a href=\"Derby%20of%20the%20eternal%20enemies\"&gt;Derby of the eternal enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nAccording to the official history of the club, Panathinaikos was founded by &lt;a href=\"Giorgos%20Kalafatis\"&gt;Giorgos Kalafatis&lt;/a&gt; on 3 February 1908, when he and 40 other athletes decided to break away from &lt;a href=\"Panellinios%20Gymnastikos%20Syllogos\"&gt;Panellinios Gymnastikos Syllogos&lt;/a&gt; following the club's decision to discontinue its football team. The name of the new club was \"Podosferikos Omilos Athinon\" (\"Football Club of Athens\"). It was founded with the aim of spreading and making more known this new sport (&lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;) to the Athenian and Greek public in general. Also, the intention of the founders was to create a team for all of Athens and to be connected with the rest of the European football movement, which was already active. The first president elected was Alexandros Kalafatis, brother of Giorgos. The ground of the team was in &lt;a href=\"Patission%20Street\"&gt;Patission Street&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20University\"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; athlete &lt;a href=\"John%20Cyril%20Campbell\"&gt;John Cyril Campbell&lt;/a&gt; was brought in as coach, the first time that a foreigner was appointed as the coach of a Greek team. &lt;a href=\"Konstantinos%20Tsiklitiras\"&gt;Konstantinos Tsiklitiras&lt;/a&gt;, the great Greek athlete of the early 20th century, played as goalkeeper for the new team.\nIn 1910, after a dispute among a number of board members, Kalafatis with most of the players\u2014also followed by Campbell\u2014decided to pull out of POA and secured a new ground in &lt;a href=\"Amerikis%20Square\"&gt;Amerikis Square&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, the name of the club changed to Panellinios Podosferikos Omilos (\"Panhellenic Football Club\") and its colours to green and white. By 1914, Campbell had returned to England but the club was already at the top of Greek football with players such as &lt;a href=\"Michalis%20Papazoglou\"&gt;Michalis Papazoglou&lt;/a&gt;, Michalis Rokkos and &lt;a href=\"Loukas%20Panourgias\"&gt;Loukas Panourgias&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1918, the team adopted the &lt;a href=\"trifolium\"&gt;trifolium&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"shamrock\"&gt;shamrock&lt;/a&gt;) as its emblem, as proposed by &lt;a href=\"Michalis%20Papazoglou\"&gt;Michalis Papazoglou&lt;/a&gt;. In 1921 and 1922, the &lt;a href=\"Athens-Piraeus%20Football%20Clubs%20Association\"&gt;Athens-Piraeus FCA&lt;/a&gt; organized the first two post-&lt;a href=\"WWI\"&gt;WWI&lt;/a&gt; championships, in both of which PPO was declared champion. By that stage, the club had outgrown both the grounds in Patission Street and Amerikis Square, due mainly to its expansion in other sports, and began to look at vacant land in the area of Perivola on &lt;a href=\"Alexandras%20Avenue\"&gt;Alexandras Avenue&lt;/a&gt; as its potential new ground. After long discussions with the &lt;a href=\"Municipality%20of%20Athens\"&gt;Municipality of Athens&lt;/a&gt;, an agreement was finally reached and in 1922 &lt;a href=\"Apostolos%20Nikolaidis%20Stadium\"&gt;\"Leoforos\"&lt;/a&gt; (\"Avenue\" in Greek) was granted to the club.\nThe move to a permanent home ground also heralded another\u2014final\u2014name change to Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos (PAO), \"All-Athenian Athletic Club\", on 15 March 1924, from now on a &lt;a href=\"multi-sport%20club\"&gt;multi-sport club&lt;/a&gt;. However, the decision was already taken by 1922.\nIn 1926, the &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Hellenic Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; (HFF) was founded and the first &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Championship\"&gt;Greek Championship&lt;/a&gt; under its authority took place in 1927.\nPanathinaikos won undefeated the Championship of &lt;a href=\"1929%E2%80%9330%20Panhellenic%20Championship\"&gt;1929\u201330&lt;/a&gt; under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zsef%20K%C3%BCnsztler\"&gt;J\u00f3zsef K\u00fcnsztler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angelos%20Messaris\"&gt;Angelos Messaris&lt;/a&gt; as the team's star player. Other notable players of this \"Belle \u00c9poque\" period of the team were &lt;a href=\"Antonis%20Migiakis\"&gt;Antonis Migiakis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diomidis%20Symeonidis\"&gt;Diomidis Symeonidis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mimis%20Pierrakos\"&gt;Mimis Pierrakos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stefanos%20Pierrakos\"&gt;Stefanos Pierrakos&lt;/a&gt;, among others. They thrashed rivals &lt;a href=\"Olympiacos%20F.C.\"&gt;Olympiacos&lt;/a&gt; 8\u20132, a result that still remains the biggest win either team has achieved against its rival, with Messaris scoring three goals. The team also defeated &lt;a href=\"Aris%20Thessaloniki%20F.C.\"&gt;Aris&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20134 away in &lt;a href=\"Thessaloniki\"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;. Messaris, who scored again three goals, became a hero and chant for the fans.\nCrisis and WWII years.\nIn 1931, a serious disagreement between leading board member &lt;a href=\"Apostolos%20Nikolaidis%20%28athlete%29\"&gt;Apostolos Nikolaidis&lt;/a&gt; from one side, and some players (most notably &lt;a href=\"Angelos%20Messaris\"&gt;Angelos Messaris&lt;/a&gt;) and club's officials on the other side, regarding the &lt;a href=\"professionalization\"&gt;professionalization&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20Greece\"&gt;Greek football&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted two years, damaged the club and led to a counterproductive period. In the meantime, the HFF &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Football%20Cup\"&gt;Greek Cup&lt;/a&gt; had commenced in 1932. The last bright moment for the Greens before World War II was winning the Cup for the first time in 1940 against Aris, 3\u20131.\nIn 1940, with the break out of the &lt;a href=\"Greco-Italian%20War\"&gt;Greco-Italian War&lt;/a&gt;, many players of the club joined the &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Army\"&gt;Hellenic Army&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mimis%20Pierrakos\"&gt;Mimis Pierrakos&lt;/a&gt; was killed during the war (later, during the 1950s, his bones were transferred from Albania back to Athens). During the &lt;a href=\"Axis%20Occupation%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Axis Occupation of Greece&lt;/a&gt; from 1941 to 1944, many players of the team became members of &lt;a href=\"United%20Panhellenic%20Organization%20of%20Youth\"&gt;United Panhellenic Organization of Youth&lt;/a&gt; (PEAN) resistance organization., while &lt;a href=\"Michalis%20Papazoglou\"&gt;Michalis Papazoglou&lt;/a&gt; had a leading role in the resistance group of &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20Iwanow-Szajnowicz\"&gt;Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz&lt;/a&gt;.P\nAfter this long crisis period, Panathinaikos had to wait until 1949 to win again a Greek Championship under the guidance of the Austrian coach &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Strnad\"&gt;Johann Strnad&lt;/a&gt;. That same year, Vangelis Panakis and &lt;a href=\"Kostas%20Linoxilakis\"&gt;Kostas Linoxilakis&lt;/a&gt; came to the club and quickly became the side's new star players. Panathinaikos was again champion for the &lt;a href=\"1952%E2%80%9353%20Panhellenic%20Championship\"&gt;1952\u201353 Panhellenic Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nUntil 1959, the team had also won seven of the last eight &lt;a href=\"Athens%20Football%20Clubs%20Association\"&gt;Athens Championships&lt;/a&gt;, the regional championships organised in Greece. In 1959, &lt;a href=\"Mimis%20Domazos\"&gt;Mimis Domazos&lt;/a&gt;, the emblematic captain of the team, made his first appearance with Panathinaikos and the same year took place the first season under the new system of Alpha Ethniki (&lt;a href=\"1959%E2%80%9360%20Alpha%20Ethniki\"&gt;1959\u201360 Alpha Ethniki&lt;/a&gt;). Panathinaikos was the champion team.\n1960s: The Golden Decade, the Bobek's rejuvenation.\nDuring the next years, Panathinaikos were again champions in 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1969 and 1970. Moreover, the team won two more Greek Cups, in 1967 and 1969. Also, during these years, a long process of rejuvenation took place in the club. Notable players retired, such as Panakis, Linoxilakis, &lt;a href=\"Takis%20Loukanidis\"&gt;Takis Loukanidis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Papaemmanouil\"&gt;Andreas Papaemmanouil&lt;/a&gt;, and the team had to count on young players like Domazos, &lt;a href=\"Antonis%20Antoniadis\"&gt;Antonis Antoniadis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anthimos%20Kapsis\"&gt;Anthimos Kapsis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kostas%20Eleftherakis\"&gt;Kostas Eleftherakis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Takis%20Ikonomopoulos\"&gt;Takis Ikonomopoulos&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Stjepan%20Bobek\"&gt;Stjepan Bobek&lt;/a&gt; was the main contributor to this process. In 1963, he became the club's head coach, changing the playing style of the team to a 4\u20133\u20133 and created a new team based on young players (the \"Bobek's rejuvenation\"). Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the Championship of 1964 without a loss, making them one of the two teams that has won the Greek Championship (with its modern system) undefeated. Notable players of the team included Panakis, Domazos, &lt;a href=\"Takis%20Ikonomopoulos\"&gt;Takis Ikonomopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Totis%20Filakouris\"&gt;Totis Filakouris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frangiskos%20Sourpis\"&gt;Frangiskos Sourpis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aristidis%20Kamaras\"&gt;Aristidis Kamaras&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20military%20junta%20of%201967%E2%80%9374\"&gt;Greek military regime&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the club, &lt;a href=\"Loukas%20Panourgias\"&gt;Loukas Panourgias&lt;/a&gt;, was forced out of the presidency. The contract of Bobek was canceled by the State, while &lt;a href=\"Apostolos%20Nikolaidis%20%28athlete%29\"&gt;Apostolos Nikolaidis&lt;/a&gt;, the old player, manager and official of the club, went on trial.\nIn 1967, the great &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9la%20Guttmann\"&gt;B\u00e9la Guttmann&lt;/a&gt; came as coach, but he soon left and ex-player &lt;a href=\"Lakis%20Petropoulos\"&gt;Lakis Petropoulos&lt;/a&gt; was appointed. Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the championships of 1969 (with a double) and 1970.\nPusk\u00e1s years and the epic road to Wembley.\n1970\u201371 European Cup finalists.\nIn 1971, under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s\"&gt;Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s&lt;/a&gt;, Panathinaikos were &lt;a href=\"1970%E2%80%9371%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1970\u201371 European Cup&lt;/a&gt; finalists, the first and only Greek team until today, losing 2\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. In the road to the final, they eliminated &lt;a href=\"Jeunesse%20Esch\"&gt;Jeunesse Esch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0K%20Slovan%20Bratislava\"&gt;Slovan Bratislava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Belgrade\"&gt;Red Star Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;. Notable players included the captain &lt;a href=\"Mimis%20Domazos\"&gt;Mimis Domazos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anthimos%20Kapsis\"&gt;Anthimos Kapsis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aristidis%20Kamaras\"&gt;Aristidis Kamaras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kostas%20Eleftherakis\"&gt;Kostas Eleftherakis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Totis%20Filakouris\"&gt;Totis Filakouris&lt;/a&gt; and the goalkeepers &lt;a href=\"Takis%20Ikonomopoulos\"&gt;Takis Ikonomopoulos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vasilis%20Konstantinou\"&gt;Vasilis Konstantinou&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Antonis%20Antoniadis\"&gt;Antonis Antoniadis&lt;/a&gt; was the top scorer in the competition scoring ten goals.\nIn the same year, Panathinaikos played for the &lt;a href=\"1971%20Intercontinental%20Cup\"&gt;1971 Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt; (due to the refusal of Ajax to participate), where they lost to Uruguayan club &lt;a href=\"Club%20Nacional%20de%20Football\"&gt;Nacional&lt;/a&gt; (1\u20131 in Greece, 2\u20131 in Uruguay). &lt;a href=\"Totis%20Filakouris\"&gt;Totis Filakouris&lt;/a&gt; was the scorer for the Greek club.\nDuring the last amateur years of Greek football, the \"Trifolium\" won one more Championship in 1972. Antonis Antoniadis was again &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20top%20goalscorers%20in%20Super%20League%20Greece%20by%20season\"&gt;top scorer&lt;/a&gt; with 39 goals (also second in Europe). His &lt;a href=\"Football%20records%20and%20statistics%20in%20Greece\"&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; remains until today in the Greek league.\nWith the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20military%20junta%20of%201967%E2%80%9374\"&gt;military regime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apostolos%20Nikolaidis%20%28athlete%29\"&gt;Apostolos Nikolaidis&lt;/a&gt; became again active for the club and was appointed honorary president of Panathinaikos. In 1975, one of the greatest coaches of his era, the Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Aymor%C3%A9%20Moreira\"&gt;Aymor\u00e9 Moreira&lt;/a&gt;, who mainly worked in Brazil (&lt;a href=\"1962%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup Champion&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazilian national team&lt;/a&gt; in 1962), was appointed. After a year-and-a-half of poor results, however, he was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Kazimierz%20G%C3%B3rski\"&gt;Kazimierz G\u00f3rski&lt;/a&gt;. With G\u00f3rski, Panathinaikos won the &lt;a href=\"double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt; in 1977, followed by a &lt;a href=\"Balkans%20Cup\"&gt;Balkans Cup&lt;/a&gt; victory in the same year. Notable foreign players who played for the team during the late 1970s include &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Ram%C3%B3n%20Ver%C3%B3n\"&gt;Juan Ram\u00f3n Ver\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Araquem%20de%20Melo\"&gt;Araquem de Melo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%93scar%20Marcelino%20%C3%81lvarez\"&gt;\u00d3scar \u00c1lvarez&lt;/a&gt;.\nVardinogiannis era (1979\u20132012).\nIn 1979, Greek football turned professional. The Vardinogiannis family purchased PAO's football department and &lt;a href=\"Yiorgos%20Vardinogiannis\"&gt;Giorgos Vardinogiannis&lt;/a&gt; became president. Panathinaikos were one of the first Greek clubs that formed a &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20association%20football\"&gt;women's team&lt;/a&gt; in 1980, but that department is currently inactive.\nThe transformation period lasted a few years, but in 1982 the club won its first professional era trophy, &lt;a href=\"1981%E2%80%9382%20Greek%20Cup\"&gt;the Greek Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and during the 1980s they would go on winning two championships (1984, 1986), four more Greek Cups (1984, 1986\u2014with a 4\u20130 against &lt;a href=\"Olympiacos%20F.C.\"&gt;Olympiacos&lt;/a&gt; in the final\u2014, 1988, 1989) and the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;Greek Super Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1988. The great star of the team during these years was &lt;a href=\"Dimitris%20Saravakos\"&gt;Dimitris Saravakos&lt;/a&gt;, nicknamed \"The Kid.\" Saravakos, a high-technique explosive midfielder and iconic captain of Panathinaikos, was the alsolute idol for the fans during the 1980s, while other players included &lt;a href=\"Nikos%20Sarganis\"&gt;Nikos Sarganis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spiros%20Livathinos\"&gt;Spiros Livathinos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Velimir%20Zajec\"&gt;Velimir Zajec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Ram%C3%B3n%20Rocha\"&gt;Juan Ram\u00f3n Rocha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christos%20Dimopoulos\"&gt;Christos Dimopoulos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giannis%20Kyrastas\"&gt;Giannis Kyrastas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1984\u201385 season, Panathinaikos, with coach &lt;a href=\"Jacek%20Gmoch\"&gt;Jacek Gmoch&lt;/a&gt; and stars &lt;a href=\"Dimitris%20Saravakos\"&gt;Dimitris Saravakos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Velimir%20Zajec\"&gt;Velimir Zajec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Ram%C3%B3n%20Rocha\"&gt;Juan Ram\u00f3n Rocha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ioannis%20Kyrastas\"&gt;Ioannis Kyrastas&lt;/a&gt;, made a run in Europe, eliminating &lt;a href=\"Feyenoord\"&gt;Feyenoord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Linfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Linfield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"IFK%20G%C3%B6teborg\"&gt;IFK G\u00f6teborg&lt;/a&gt; to reach the semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"1984%E2%80%9385%20European%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt;, where they were knocked out by &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1987%E2%80%9388%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1987\u201388&lt;/a&gt;, they made it also to the quarter-finals of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, eliminating &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AJ%20Auxerre\"&gt;Auxerre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Budapest%20Honv%C3%A9d%20FC\"&gt;Budapest Honv\u00e9d&lt;/a&gt;. Dimitris Saravakos was top scorer of the competition.\nThe 1990s were an even more successful period for the club, both nationally and internationally. Four Greek championships (1990, 1991, 1995, 1996), four Greek Cups (1991, 1993, 1994, 1995) and two &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Super%20Cup\"&gt;Greek Super Cup&lt;/a&gt;s (1993, 1994) were awarded to the club.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1991%E2%80%9392%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1991\u201392&lt;/a&gt; season, Panathinaikos reached also the last eight of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt; and took part in the first ever European tournament to have a group stage.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;1995\u201396&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Ramon%20Rocha\"&gt;Juan Ramon Rocha&lt;/a&gt; as coach and key players &lt;a href=\"Krzysztof%20Warzycha\"&gt;Krzysztof Warzycha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zef%20Wandzik\"&gt;J\u00f3zef Wandzik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stratos%20Apostolakis\"&gt;Stratos Apostolakis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Georgios%20Georgiadis%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Georgios Georgiadis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dimitris%20Markos\"&gt;Dimitris Markos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giannis%20Kalitzakis\"&gt;Giannis Kalitzakis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giorgos%20Donis\"&gt;Giorgos Donis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Jose%20Borrelli\"&gt;Juan Jose Borrelli&lt;/a&gt;, Panathinaikos reached the Champions League semi-finals, finishing first in the group stage against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AaB%20Fodbold\"&gt;Aalborg BK&lt;/a&gt; and eliminating &lt;a href=\"Legia%20Warsaw\"&gt;Legia Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; in the quarter-finals.\nIn the semi-finals, Panathinaikos faced &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt;, recording an impressive 0\u20131 first leg away victory with Krzysztof Warzycha scoring the winning goal. Ajax had a record of 22 undefeated international matches until then, with Panathinaikos breaking their series. The Greek team, however, suffered a 0\u20133 defeat on the second leg. Thus, Panathinaikos was denied entry to a Champions League final once more.\nIn the summer of 2000, President Giorgos Vardinogiannis resigned from his duties with complaints for the &lt;a href=\"Paranga%20%28football%29\"&gt;refereeing situation in Greece&lt;/a&gt; and passed his shares to his nephew &lt;a href=\"Giannis%20Vardinogiannis\"&gt;Giannis Vardinogiannis&lt;/a&gt;, who changed the style of the club's management. &lt;a href=\"Angelos%20Anastasiadis\"&gt;Angelos Anastasiadis&lt;/a&gt; was initially appointed coach of the team and later the ex-player &lt;a href=\"Giannis%20Kyrastas\"&gt;Giannis Kyrastas&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the arrival of coach &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Markarian\"&gt;Sergio Markarian&lt;/a&gt;, Panathinaikos reached the quarter-finals of the &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2001\u201302 UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, being eliminated by &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. Panathinaikos had passed the first &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage\"&gt;group stage&lt;/a&gt; as the top club against &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RCD%20Mallorca\"&gt;Mallorca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Schalke%2004\"&gt;Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt;, and the second group stage as second against &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, Porto and &lt;a href=\"AC%20Sparta%20Prague\"&gt;Sparta Prague&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the first leg of the quarter-finals, Panathinaikos managed to defeat &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; by 1\u20130 in &lt;a href=\"Apostolos%20Nikolaidis%20Stadium\"&gt;Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. The second leg in &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Nou\"&gt;Camp Nou&lt;/a&gt; was to be an eventful one. Panathinaikos scored first thanks to a beautiful goal by &lt;a href=\"Michalis%20Konstantinou\"&gt;Michalis Konstantinou&lt;/a&gt; but eventually was eliminated as Barcelona scored three goals.\n\u0399n Europe, Panathinaikos made it to the quarter-finals of &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup quarter-finals&lt;/a&gt;. En route, the Greek team had knocked-out &lt;a href=\"PFC%20Litex%20Lovech\"&gt;Litex Lovech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fenerbah%C3%A7e%20S.K.%20%28football%29\"&gt;Fenerbah\u00e7e&lt;/a&gt; (with an impressive 4\u20131 win in Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium), &lt;a href=\"FC%20Slovan%20Liberec\"&gt;Slovan Liberec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"R.S.C.%20Anderlecht\"&gt;Anderlecht&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the quarter-finals, although winning the first match in &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20das%20Antas\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio das Antas&lt;/a&gt; against eventual winners of the trophy &lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;FC Porto&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&lt;/a&gt;, with the header of &lt;a href=\"Emmanuel%20Olisadebe\"&gt;Emmanuel Olisadebe&lt;/a&gt;, they were eliminated in the second leg after extra time.\nNotable players of this team included &lt;a href=\"Takis%20Fyssas\"&gt;Takis Fyssas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giorgos%20Karagounis\"&gt;Giorgos Karagounis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonis%20Nikopolidis\"&gt;Antonis Nikopolidis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angelos%20Basinas\"&gt;Angelos Basinas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nikos%20Lyberopoulos\"&gt;Nikos Lyberopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michalis%20Konstantinou\"&gt;Michalis Konstantinou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giourkas%20Seitaridis\"&gt;Giourkas Seitaridis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotirios%20Kyrgiakos\"&gt;Sotirios Kyrgiakos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paulo%20Sousa\"&gt;Paulo Sousa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goran%20Vlaovi%C4%87\"&gt;Goran Vlaovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rene%20Henriksen\"&gt;Rene Henriksen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joonas%20Kolkka\"&gt;Joonas Kolkka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Michaelsen\"&gt;Jan Michaelsen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emmanuel%20Olisadebe\"&gt;Emmanuel Olisadebe&lt;/a&gt;, considered by the fans one of the best teams in the club's history.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Alpha%20Ethniki\"&gt;2002\u201303 Alpha Ethniki&lt;/a&gt; season, they lost the Greek championship in the last two games by arch-rivals Olympiacos.\nUnder the guidance of Israeli coach &lt;a href=\"Itzhak%20Shum\"&gt;Itzhak Shum&lt;/a&gt;, Panathinaikos managed to win the championship in 2004. They won also the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20Greek%20Cup\"&gt;Cup&lt;/a&gt;, beating Olympiacos 3\u20131 in the final, making the double. New players like &lt;a href=\"Ezequiel%20Gonz%C3%A1lez\"&gt;Ezequiel Gonz\u00e1lez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20Sanmartean\"&gt;Lucian Sanmartean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Markus%20M%C3%BCnch%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Markus M\u00fcnch&lt;/a&gt; had signed the summer before. In the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, they came third in the group stage facing &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"VfB%20Stuttgart\"&gt;VfB Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Shum was unexpectedly fired early in the next season (&lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20Greek%20football\"&gt;2004\u201305&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Zden%C4%9Bk%20%C5%A0%C4%8Dasn%C3%BD\"&gt;Zden\u011bk \u0160\u010dasn\u00fd&lt;/a&gt; succeeded him on the bench. Panathinaikos finished second in the championship, while in the Champions League they came again third in the group stage facing &lt;a href=\"Rosenborg%20BK\"&gt;Rosenborg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PSV%20Eindhoven\"&gt;PSV&lt;/a&gt; and Arsenal. They continued in the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, where they were eliminated by &lt;a href=\"Sevilla%20FC\"&gt;Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2005, major changes were made in the team's roster. Players like &lt;a href=\"Angelos%20Basinas\"&gt;Angelos Basinas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michalis%20Konstantinou\"&gt;Michalis Konstantinou&lt;/a&gt; departed, while others like &lt;a href=\"Fl%C3%A1vio%20Concei%C3%A7%C3%A3o\"&gt;Fl\u00e1vio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Igor%20Bi%C5%A1%C4%87an\"&gt;Igor Bi\u0161\u0107an&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Ivanschitz\"&gt;Andreas Ivanschitz&lt;/a&gt; arrived. \u0160\u010dasn\u00fd gave his seat to &lt;a href=\"Alberto%20Malesani\"&gt;Alberto Malesani&lt;/a&gt;. At the start of the &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Panathinaikos%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2006\u201307&lt;/a&gt; season, Malesani left the team and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Backe\"&gt;Hans Backe&lt;/a&gt;, who left only three months after his appointment; &lt;a href=\"V%C3%ADctor%20Mu%C3%B1oz\"&gt;V\u00edctor Mu\u00f1oz&lt;/a&gt; was his replacement. For the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Panathinaikos%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2007\u201308&lt;/a&gt; season, Panathinaikos hired &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Peseiro\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Peseiro&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 22 April 2008, and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50%\u2014after 30 years of full ownership\u2014through an \u20ac80\u00a0million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% and the other shareholders 34% (with main investors &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Vgenopoulos%20%28businessman%29\"&gt;Andreas Vgenopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pavlos%20Giannakopoulos\"&gt;Pavlos Giannakopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adamantios%20Polemis\"&gt;Adamantios Polemis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nikos%20Pateras\"&gt;Nikos Pateras&lt;/a&gt;). Nikos Pateras was selected to be the new president of the club.\nFollowing the major changes in 2008, Panathinaikos hired &lt;a href=\"Henk%20ten%20Cate\"&gt;Henk ten Cate&lt;/a&gt; as coach and bought many expensive players, such as &lt;a href=\"Gilberto%20Silva\"&gt;Gilberto Silva&lt;/a&gt; from Arsenal and &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Rodrigues%20dos%20Santos\"&gt;Gabriel&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Fluminense%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Fluminense&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Panathinaikos%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2008\u201309&lt;/a&gt; season, the Greens proved that they could hold their weight in the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; by reaching the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase\"&gt;last 16&lt;/a&gt;. However, they disappointed in the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Super%20League%20Greece\"&gt;Greek Championship&lt;/a&gt;, finishing third in the regular season, though they managed to come second overall after the playoff mini-league.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Panathinaikos%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2009\u201310&lt;/a&gt; season was a successful one for Panathinaikos. During the summer transfer period, the club bought &lt;a href=\"Djibril%20Ciss%C3%A9\"&gt;Djibril Ciss\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20de%20Marseille\"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kostas%20Katsouranis\"&gt;Kostas Katsouranis&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"S.L.%20Benfica\"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Leto\"&gt;Sebasti\u00e1n Leto&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; and various other players, spending more than \u20ac35\u00a0million in total. Henk ten Cate left in December to be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Nikos%20Nioplias\"&gt;Nikos Nioplias&lt;/a&gt;. The team managed to reach the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20knockout%20phase\"&gt;last 16&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt;, eliminating &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Roma\"&gt;A.S. Roma&lt;/a&gt; after two amazing matches in &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Athens%29\"&gt;Olympic Stadium of Athens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Olimpico\"&gt;Stadio Olimpico&lt;/a&gt;. Panathinaikos also won both the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Super%20League%20Greece\"&gt;Greek Championship&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Greek%20Cup\"&gt;Greek Cup&lt;/a&gt;, beating &lt;a href=\"Aris%20Thessaloniki%20F.C.\"&gt;Aris&lt;/a&gt; by 1\u20130 in the final of the latter, thanks to a goal by &lt;a href=\"Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Leto\"&gt;Sebasti\u00e1n Leto&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2011, due to financial problems and management disagreements, Panathinaikos sold &lt;a href=\"Djibril%20Ciss%C3%A9\"&gt;Ciss\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; for \u20ac5.8\u00a0million to &lt;a href=\"S.S.%20Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt; and first-choice &lt;a href=\"goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Tzorvas\"&gt;Alexandros Tzorvas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Citt%C3%A0%20di%20Palermo\"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the budget. New players then entered, such as &lt;a href=\"Quincy%20Owusu-Abeyie\"&gt;Quincy Owusu-Abeyie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toch%C3%A9%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Toch\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vitolo%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29\"&gt;Vitolo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zeca%20%28Greek%20footballer%29\"&gt;Zeca&lt;/a&gt;. The club also changed their president and chose Dimitris Gontikas to be the new chairman. Panathinaikos failed to qualify to the group stage of &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2011\u201312 Champions League&lt;/a&gt; after they were knocked out by &lt;a href=\"Odense%20Boldklub\"&gt;Odense BK&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20135 on aggregate.\nRecent years (2012\u2013).\nPanathinaikos' downfall continued as a result of the serious riots in the Panathinaikos\u2013Olympiacos derby of 18 March 2012. The entire board quit and Panathinaikos remained headless for about two months. However, the owner of &lt;a href=\"Skai%20TV\"&gt;Skai TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giannis%20Alafouzos\"&gt;Giannis Alafouzos&lt;/a&gt;, devised a plan to take Vardinogiannis' shares (54.7%) and make them available to fans around Greece so that everyone could contribute a desired amount, so that Panathinaikos could overcome the crisis. His plan seemed to be working, as a new 20-member board was elected with Dimitris Gontikas at the president's chair again, though it was yet to be seen how the fans would respond to Panathinaikos' call for help.\nOn 2 July 2012, the PAO Alliance 2012 finally opened to the public so that everyone could be a member and contribute a desired amount in return for privileges. After a few weeks of operation, 8,606 members had signed up, some of which were current or former Panathinaikos players, including &lt;a href=\"Jean-Alain%20Boumsong\"&gt;Jean-Alain Boumsong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotiris%20Ninis\"&gt;Sotiris Ninis&lt;/a&gt;, Gilberto Silva and Djibril Ciss\u00e9, among others.\nOn 18 July 2012, marked a historical day in Panathinaikos history, as Giannis Vardinogiannis gave his shares\u201454.7% of Panathinaikos\u2014to the Panathinaikos Alliance, thereby allowing Panathinaikos to have a fresh start with their own fans at the steering wheel, who through elections (amongst the members of the Alliance) they compose the board of directors and elect the club's president. The first president elected was &lt;a href=\"Giannis%20Alafouzos\"&gt;Giannis Alafouzos&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first season with the Panathinaikos Alliance at the helm was nothing short of abysmal for the club. While still enduring financial troubles, Panathinaikos finished sixth in the championship and failed to qualify for the European competition for the first time in 16 years.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Panathinaikos%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2013\u201314&lt;/a&gt; season, the membership had risen up to 9,305 members. Starting the football year, both fans and journalists were very skeptical of Panathinaikos' chances of a successful season, and many people expected the team to suffer relegation from the &lt;a href=\"Super%20League%20Greece\"&gt;Super League Greece&lt;/a&gt;. In May 2013, &lt;a href=\"Yannis%20Anastasiou\"&gt;Yannis Anastasiou&lt;/a&gt; was appointed manager, and he planned a team based on players from the Panathinaikos Youth Academies joined by experienced foreign players looking to revive their careers. Despite the early skepticism, Panathinaikos' fans supported the team through the rough start, and the season turned out to be a massive success in light of the dire financial situation of the club and the young and inexperienced squad. The club finished fourth in the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Super%20League%20Greece\"&gt;regular season&lt;/a&gt; and second after the playoffs (meaning they qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2014\u201315 Champions League&lt;/a&gt;), with &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Berg\"&gt;Marcus Berg&lt;/a&gt; the top scorer of the team. Panathinaikos also won the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Greek%20Football%20Cup\"&gt;2013\u201314 Greek Football Cup&lt;/a&gt; after a 4\u20131 win over &lt;a href=\"PAOK%20FC\"&gt;PAOK&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 2 November 2015, after bad performances and a home draw with &lt;a href=\"AEK%20Athens%20F.C.\"&gt;AEK Athens&lt;/a&gt;, manager &lt;a href=\"Yannis%20Anastasiou\"&gt;Yannis Anastasiou&lt;/a&gt; was sacked and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20Stramaccioni\"&gt;Andrea Stramaccioni&lt;/a&gt;. Further successive poor results under the latter's reign, combined with loss of dressing room control, led to the dismissal of Stramaccioni on 1 December 2016, with former Panathinaikos player and &lt;a href=\"Greece%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; international &lt;a href=\"Marinos%20Ouzounidis\"&gt;Marinos Ouzounidis&lt;/a&gt; taking over the management at the club. Ouzounidis had some great moments with Panathinaikos and was generally liked by the fans. His resignation, due to problems with owner Giannis Alafouzos sparked another wave of disappointment and hatred against Alafouzos from the fans.\nOn 24 April 2018 UEFA decided to exclude Panathinaikos FC from participating in the next UEFA club competition for which it would otherwise qualify in the next three seasons as a result of Financial Fair Play breaches\n&lt;a href=\"Giorgos%20Donis\"&gt;Giorgos Donis&lt;/a&gt; was announced as the new coach on 3 July 2018. Coach Donis had a great start of the season despite beginning with \u22126 points in the championship, counting 6 consecutive wins that put Panathinaikos on top of the table. However, due to problems with his salary and a clash with Giannis Alafouzos, he was forced to resign in 2019. This situation made the relations between Alafouzos and the fans worse, with protests and demonstrations during games against him. Panathinaikos remained one of the top clubs in Greece, but its absence from European tournaments was a major factor in the fans' disappointment with the ownership. During the summer of 2020, a series of bad decisions were made from Giannis Alafouzos, who chose to let most of the players that had contributed to a very good season go.\nSpaniard &lt;a href=\"Dani%20Poyatos\"&gt;Dani Poyatos&lt;/a&gt; signed on as head of the club on 22 July 2020 for two years, taking over from George Donis' work. Poyatos was sacked after a poor start of the season on 12 October and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20B%C3%B6l%C3%B6ni\"&gt;L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00f6l\u00f6ni&lt;/a&gt;. After a disappointing fifth position in the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Super%20League%20Greece\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; and the failure to guide them to a European qualification spot B\u00f6l\u00f6ni was sacked and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Jovanovi%C4%87%20%28football%20manager%29\"&gt;Ivan Jovanovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrest and colours.\nCrest evolution.\nWhite was the colour that was first used by the team in 1908 (probably like that of the first crest). The first symbol of the club was an &lt;a href=\"Ball%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;association football ball&lt;/a&gt; of the era.\nIn 1911, the colours changed to green and white. In 1918, &lt;a href=\"Michalis%20Papazoglou\"&gt;Michalis Papazoglou&lt;/a&gt; proposed the &lt;a href=\"trifolium\"&gt;trifolium&lt;/a&gt;, symbol of harmony, unity, nature and good luck, as emblem of Panathinaikos. The officials of the club were looking for a universal, non-nationalistic or localistic, symbol aiming to represent the whole &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; at the country and further at the world. Papazoglou used to have it sewn on his shirt since he was competing for a club in his native &lt;a href=\"Kad%C4%B1k%C3%B6y\"&gt;Chalcedon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; (present-day Istanbul, Turkey). He was possibly inspired by &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Sherring\"&gt;Billy Sherring&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Canadian\"&gt;Irish Canadian&lt;/a&gt; athlete who had won the &lt;a href=\"1906%20Intercalated%20Games\"&gt;Athens 1906 Olympic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"marathon\"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt; (1906 Intercalated Games) wearing a white outfit with a big green shamrock on the chest.\nGeorgios Chatzopoulos, member\u2014and later president\u2014of the club and director of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery%20%28Athens%29\"&gt;National Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, took over to design the new emblem for the team. Up to the end of the 1970s, a trifolium (green or white) was sewed on heart's side of the jersey and was big in size. With the beginning of professionalism, the crest of the F.C. was created, accompanied by the club initials and the year of founding, 1908.\nUntil today, the team's traditional colours are green and white (green for health, &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"physis\"&gt;physiolatry&lt;/a&gt;, and white for &lt;a href=\"virtue\"&gt;virtue&lt;/a&gt;), although the white sometimes is omitted, used as trim or as an alternative. During the first years after the establishment of green as Panathinaikos' primary colour, players were wearing green shirts, white shorts and green socks. During the 1930s, an appearance with characteristic horizontal strips was established. This motive was used also in the next decades as primary or second choice. Since then, the uniform style has changed many times, but green has always remained the team's primary colour.\nShirt sponsors and manufacturers.\nSince 1979, when football became professional in Greece, Panathinaikos had a specific kit manufacturer and since 1983 a specific shirt sponsor as well. The following table shows in detail Panathinaikos kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors by year:\nStadiums and facilities.\nPanathinaikos' traditional home ground since the early 1920s is the &lt;a href=\"Apostolos%20Nikolaidis%20Stadium\"&gt;Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest active football stadium in Greece, in the &lt;a href=\"Ampelokipoi%2C%20Athens\"&gt;Ampelokipoi&lt;/a&gt; district of central &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium is located on &lt;a href=\"Alexandras%20Avenue\"&gt;Alexandras Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and is most commonly referred to as \"Leoforos\" (&lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; for \"Avenue\"). It is considered one of the most historic stadiums in Greece, as it was used by the &lt;a href=\"Greece%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Greek national team&lt;/a&gt; as home ground for many years (most recently for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt; qualifying matches) and even by Panathinaikos' biggest rivals, &lt;a href=\"AEK%20Athens%20F.C.\"&gt;AEK Athens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Olympiacos%20F.C.\"&gt;Olympiacos&lt;/a&gt;, on various occasions.\nPanathinaikos left \"Leoforos\" in 1984 to play in the newly built &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Athens%29\"&gt;Athens Olympic Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. In 2000, then-club president Angelos Filippidis announced a return to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, following a \u20ac7\u00a0million renovation. Capacity was reduced from 25,000 to 16,620, new dressing rooms were built and modular stand roofing was added in compliance with &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; requirements, but in 2004, stricter standards were announced and the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium would need further expansion were it to remain suitable for UEFA-sanctioned matches. This was precluded by local zoning regulations and the team had to return to the Olympic Stadium once more until a new stadium, the proposed &lt;a href=\"Votanikos%20Arena\"&gt;Votanikos Arena&lt;/a&gt;, was built. The \"Leoforos\" ground was due for demolition.\nOn 27 January 2007, the board of Panathinaikos decided to reuse the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium for the team's 2007\u201308 domestic league and UEFA Cup home games. Additionally, the club officials decided to install new lawn, new seats and upgrade the press conference room and the restrooms.\nAs of October 2013, and due to the club's and the country's financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium have been put on hold. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again.\nThe current president of the club, &lt;a href=\"Giannis%20Alafouzos\"&gt;Giannis Alafouzos&lt;/a&gt;, declared his intention for another renovation of the stadium and the capacity increase, while the &lt;a href=\"Panathinaikos%20Movement\"&gt;Panathinaikos Movement&lt;/a&gt; made its propositions for a total reconstruction.\nIn 2019 the owner of Panathinaikos basketball team presented a funding plan for the construction of the new football and basketball stadiums. The Greek government confirmed in 2020 the construction of the new stadiums in the &lt;a href=\"Panathinaikos%20F.C.%20New%20Stadium\"&gt;Votanikos&lt;/a&gt; area to be completed by 2024.\n&lt;a href=\"Paiania%20%28training%20ground%29\"&gt;Paiania&lt;/a&gt; has been the training ground of Panathinaikos since 1981. That same year, the &lt;a href=\"Panathinaikos%20F.C.%20Academy\"&gt;Academy&lt;/a&gt; of the club was reorganized, becoming one of the best in the country and feeding the first team with notable players, such as &lt;a href=\"Giorgos%20Karagounis\"&gt;Giorgos Karagounis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angelos%20Basinas\"&gt;Angelos Basinas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotirios%20Kyrgiakos\"&gt;Sotirios Kyrgiakos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotiris%20Ninis\"&gt;Sotiris Ninis&lt;/a&gt; among others, key members of the Greek national team. In 2013, was decided the move of the club from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the team. Located in the area of &lt;a href=\"Koropi\"&gt;Koropi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Georgios%20Kalafatis%20Sports%20Center\"&gt;Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center&lt;/a&gt; became a new training ground and Academy base of Panathinaikos.\nFinancial information.\nUntil 1979, football in Greece was still in amateur level. The team, such as the other departments of &lt;a href=\"Panathinaikos%20A.O.\"&gt;Panathinaikos A.O.&lt;/a&gt;, depended on the financial support of the club's members, while the president (responsible for all athletic departments) was elected by the Board members. In 1979, the Greek football turned professional and the Vardinogiannis family purchased the football department. &lt;a href=\"Yiorgos%20Vardinogiannis\"&gt;Giorgos Vardinogiannis&lt;/a&gt; became the new president. Vardinogiannis family were the owners of the club the next decades.\nOn 22 April 2008, and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50%\u2014after 30 years of full ownership\u2014through an \u20ac80\u00a0million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% (as before) and the new shareholders 34%. &lt;a href=\"Pavlos%20Giannakopoulos\"&gt;Pavlos Giannakopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nikos%20Pateras\"&gt;Nikos Pateras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adamantios%20Polemis\"&gt;Adamantios Polemis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Vgenopoulos%20%28businessman%29\"&gt;Andreas Vgenopoulos&lt;/a&gt; were the main investors, plus other minor shareholders. Nikos Pateras was selected to be the new president.\nIn 2011, due to financial problems and management disagreements, the direction decided to reduce the budget and sell many players. In 2012, the owner of &lt;a href=\"Skai%20TV\"&gt;Skai TV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giannis%20Alafouzos\"&gt;Giannis Alafouzos&lt;/a&gt;, devised a plan to take Vardinogiannis' shares (54.7%) and make them available to fans around Greece so that everyone could contribute, so that Panathinaikos could overcome the crisis. His intention was to create a new, for the Greek athletic standards, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20fan-owned%20sports%20teams\"&gt;supporter-owned football club&lt;/a&gt;. On 2 July 2012, the Panathenaic Alliance finally opened to the public so that everyone could be a member and contribute a desired amount in return for privileges. A few days later, Giannis Vardinogiannis gave his shares\u201454.7% of Panathinaikos\u2014to the Alliance, while the other shareholders maintained their percentage. The members of the Alliance through elections compose the board of directors and elect the club's president. The first president elected was &lt;a href=\"Giannis%20Alafouzos\"&gt;Giannis Alafouzos&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, was decided the move of the team from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the club. Located in the area of &lt;a href=\"Koropi\"&gt;Koropi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Georgios%20Kalafatis%20Sports%20Center\"&gt;Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center&lt;/a&gt; became the new training ground and academy base of Panathinaikos.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Panathinaikos%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2014\u201315&lt;/a&gt; season, the membership had risen up to 8,495 members contributing a total of \u20ac2,680,041.\nPanathinaikos currently is partially &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20fan-owned%20sports%20teams%23Greece\"&gt;supporter-owned football club&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the latest accounts in 2016 Panathenaic Alliance shares have been reduced to (15%), &lt;a href=\"Giannis%20Alafouzos\"&gt;Giannis Alafouzos&lt;/a&gt; through Sortivo International Ltd and his own shares is the largest shareholder at (74%). &lt;a href=\"Giannis%20Alafouzos\"&gt;Giannis Alafouzos&lt;/a&gt; suddenly decided to quit the team in September 2017, announcing his departure in a written statement and inviting potential investors to express their interest in buying the team.\nCurrent sponsorships:\nSupporters.\nPanathinaikos was founded by middle class athletes (with &lt;a href=\"Giorgos%20Kalafatis\"&gt;Giorgos Kalafatis&lt;/a&gt; as a key figure) aiming of spreading and making more known football to the Athenian and Greek public in general. Also, their intention was to create a team for all of Athens and to be connected with the rest of the European football movement, which was already active.\nToday, according to UEFA and numerous polls and researches by the biggest newspapers and poll companies in a span of 20 years, Panathinaikos is the second most popular football team in Greece, with the difference behind &lt;a href=\"Olympiacos%20F.C.\"&gt;Olympiacos&lt;/a&gt; to be varied between 2% to 9% and the difference in front of the third to be fluctuated between 17% to 21% among the fans. They have the highest popularity in &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan area according to many of the corresponding polls, having also a large fanbase in all Greek prefectures, in Cyprus and in the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20diaspora\"&gt;Greek diaspora&lt;/a&gt;. They historically have a large fanbase among the highly-educated Greek upper class (traditionally representing the old Athenian society), while they are also popular among the middle and lower classes.\nPanathinaikos supporters hold both records of the most season tickets sales (31,091 in 2010) and highest average attendance for a unique season (44,942 in the 1985\u201386 season) in the history of Greek football.\nThe main organized supporters of Panathinaikos are known as &lt;a href=\"Gate%2013\"&gt;Gate 13&lt;/a&gt; (established in 1966), the oldest fan association in Greece, which consists of around 80 clubs alongside Greece and Cyprus.\nGate 13 style of supporting includes the use of green fireworks, large and small green flags, displaying of banners and especially the creation of colorful and large choreographies, noisy and constant cheering and other supporters stuff. Gate 13 has over the years become a part of the club by affecting club decisions and by following the club on all occasions.\nThey share a traditional friendship with Ultras &lt;a href=\"SK%20Rapid%20Wien\"&gt;Rapid Wien&lt;/a&gt;, based mainly on the common green and white colours. Moreover, they have been sharing since the early 10s' close relations with &lt;a href=\"GNK%20Dinamo%20Zagreb\"&gt;Dinamo Zagreb's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Blue%20Boys\"&gt;Bad Blue Boys&lt;/a&gt; (based on their common rivalry with Red Star and Olympiacos fans, capital city teams and mutual respect for each other's ultras achievements) and also with Fedayin of &lt;a href=\"A.S.%20Roma\"&gt;A.S. Roma&lt;/a&gt; based on the capital city team factor, their mutual respect and the ancient Athens and ancient Roma cultural connection.\nPALEFIP (Panhellenic club of Panathinaikos friends) is another supporters organization.\nPanathenaic Alliance, a collective organisation of the fan base, is the major shareholder of the football club, making it currently the only &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20fan-owned%20sports%20teams\"&gt;supporter-owned&lt;/a&gt; football club in Greece. The members of the Alliance, through elections, compose the board of directors and elect the club's president.\n&lt;a href=\"Panathinaikos%20Movement\"&gt;Panathinaikos Movement&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 2012, is also a Greek political party founded by people with an initial common their love for the sports club of Panathinaikos and the wish for a new stadium for the football team, despite the bureaucracy of the Greek state.\nSeasons in the 21st century.\nKey: R32 = Round of 32, R16 = Round of 16, QF = Quarter-finals, SF = Semi-finals, RU = Runners up, C = Champions.\nStatistics and records.\n&lt;a href=\"Mimis%20Domazos\"&gt;Mimis Domazos&lt;/a&gt; holds the record for Panathinaikos appearances, having played 502 first-team matches between 1959 and 1980.
