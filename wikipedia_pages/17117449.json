Stahel-Sz\u00e1mwald (November 5, 1825 \u2013 December 4, 1912) was a &lt;a href=\"Hungarians\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; soldier who emigrated to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and became a &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"General%20officer\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, he served as a U.S. diplomat, a mining engineer, and a life insurance company executive. He received the &lt;a href=\"Medal%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Medal of Honor&lt;/a&gt; for gallantry in action at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Piedmont\"&gt;Battle of Piedmont&lt;/a&gt; in 1864.\nBirth and early years.\nStahel was born in &lt;a href=\"Szeged\"&gt;Szeged&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Kingdom of Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, 200\u00a0km southeast of &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;. After schooling in Szeged and Budapest, he entered the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Army%20%28Holy%20Roman%20Empire%29\"&gt;Austrian Army&lt;/a&gt;, rising to the rank of &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;. Stahel joined the movement for Hungarian independence led by &lt;a href=\"Lajos%20Kossuth\"&gt;Lajos Kossuth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201848\"&gt;Revolution of 1848&lt;/a&gt;. He served on the staffs of Gen. &lt;a href=\"Art%C3%BAr%20G%C3%B6rgey\"&gt;Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey&lt;/a&gt; and Gen. &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Debaufre%20Guyon\"&gt;Richard Debaufre Guyon&lt;/a&gt;. When the Hungarian uprising against the &lt;a href=\"Habsburg\"&gt;Habsburg&lt;/a&gt; dynasty was put down in 1849, he fled to &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt; and then to &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; before migrating to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in 1859. Until the outbreak of the American Civil War, he worked for \"Deutsche illustrirte Familienbl\u00e4tter\", a &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German-language&lt;/a&gt; newspaper in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.\nCivil War service.\nIn 1861, with the outbreak of war, Stahel and &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Blenker\"&gt;Louis Blenker&lt;/a&gt; recruited the &lt;a href=\"8th%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment\"&gt;8th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, the 1st German Rifles or Blenker's Rifles. Stahel, who had dropped the \"Sz\u00e1mwald\" portion of his surname, became the &lt;a href=\"regiment\"&gt;regiment&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt;, while Blenker served as &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;. Stahel first saw combat at the &lt;a href=\"First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run\"&gt;First Battle of Bull Run&lt;/a&gt;, leading the regiment in Blenker's first &lt;a href=\"brigade\"&gt;brigade&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dixon%20Miles\"&gt;Dixon Miles&lt;/a&gt;'s Fifth Division. The regiment covered the flight of the Union Army of &lt;a href=\"Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Brig. Gen.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Irvin%20McDowell\"&gt;Irvin McDowell&lt;/a&gt;. The 8th New York served in Blenker's &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; of the newborn &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Potomac\"&gt;Army of the Potomac&lt;/a&gt; until it was transferred to &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;western Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. Stahel become a &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt; on August 11, 1861 and a brigadier general three months later.\nStahel led a brigade under &lt;a href=\"Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Maj. Gen.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20C.%20Fremont\"&gt;John C. Fremont&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Department\"&gt;Mountain Department&lt;/a&gt; during an incursion into the &lt;a href=\"Shenandoah%20Valley\"&gt;Shenandoah Valley&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. His brigade was of Fremont's left at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cross%20Keys\"&gt;Battle of Cross Keys&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href=\"Stonewall%20Jackson\"&gt;Stonewall Jackson&lt;/a&gt; stopped the Union advance into the Valley. Stahel's position on the left exposed his command to a flank attack by &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Trimble\"&gt;Isaac Trimble&lt;/a&gt;'s brigade as Fremont was attempting to turn the right of the Confederate line.\nBy July 1862, Stahel was commander of the first brigade of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20C.%20Schenck\"&gt;Robert C. Schenck&lt;/a&gt;'s first division Army of Virginia in the corps led by &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Sigel\"&gt;Franz Sigel&lt;/a&gt; in Maj. Gen. &lt;a href=\"John%20Pope%20%28military%20officer%29\"&gt;John Pope&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;Army of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run\"&gt;Second Battle of Bull Run&lt;/a&gt;, Schenck was wounded and Stahel became acting commander of the division. (&lt;a href=\"Adolphus%20Buschbeck\"&gt;Adolphus Buschbeck&lt;/a&gt; succeeded to command of the brigade.) Stahel's brigade was one of two that covered Sigel's retreat when Pope's army was defeated.\nStahel rose to division command by late 1862 and was promoted to &lt;a href=\"Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;major general&lt;/a&gt; on March 14, 1863. He briefly commanded the XI Corps during the fall of 1862.\nIn March 1863 Stahel was assigned to command a Union cavalry division in the defenses of &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; When the division joined the Army of the Potomac in June 1863, &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Pleasonton\"&gt;Alfred Pleasonton&lt;/a&gt; had Stahel removed, promoting &lt;a href=\"Judson%20Kilpatrick\"&gt;Judson Kilpatrick&lt;/a&gt; in his place. He then served as cavalry commander in the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20the%20Susquehanna\"&gt;Department of the Susquehanna&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Gettysburg%20Campaign\"&gt;Gettysburg Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the spring of 1864, Stahel was commander of the 1st Cavalry Division under Franz Sigel in the Shenandoah Valley. At the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20New%20Market\"&gt;Battle of New Market&lt;/a&gt;, on May 15, 1864, his division was on the left of Sigel's line. It attacked the Confederate line but was repulsed by artillery fire. The division recoiled under attack by the Confederate forces of &lt;a href=\"John%20C.%20Breckinridge\"&gt;John C. Breckinridge&lt;/a&gt; when they counterattacked.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Piedmont\"&gt;Battle of Piedmont&lt;/a&gt; on June 5, 1864, serving as cavalry commander under Maj. Gen. &lt;a href=\"David%20Hunter\"&gt;David Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, Stahel distinguished himself under fire until he was hit in the shoulder. This led to Stahel's receiving the &lt;a href=\"Medal%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Medal of Honor&lt;/a&gt;, on November 4, 1893, for leading his division until seriously wounded. Stahel served, after recovering from his wound, on court-martial duty until he resigned on February 8, 1865.\nPostbellum career.\nAfter the Civil War, Stahel served in the United States diplomatic corps as consul in &lt;a href=\"Yokohama\"&gt;Yokohama&lt;/a&gt;, (1866\u20131869) and &lt;a href=\"Osaka\"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; (1877\u20131884). After that he was &lt;a href=\"Consulate%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States%2C%20Shanghai\"&gt;United States Consul General in Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; (1884\u20131885). Between diplomatic assignments, he worked as a mining engineer. Upon returning to the United States for reasons of health, Stahel worked for the &lt;a href=\"AXA%20Equitable%20Life%20Insurance%20Company\"&gt;Equitable Life Insurance Company&lt;/a&gt; in New York City. \nStahel died in a New York City at 87 years of age. After a funeral in Washington, he was buried in the &lt;a href=\"Arlington%20National%20Cemetery\"&gt;Arlington National Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedal of Honor citation.\nRank and organization: Major General, U.S. Volunteers.
