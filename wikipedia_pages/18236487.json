It was part of &lt;a href=\"Tenix\"&gt;Tenix&lt;/a&gt; until the defence contracting arm became known as Tenix Defence. It had two divisions: Tenix Marine and Tenix Aerospace and Defence (comprising the former Land, Aerospace and Electronic Systems divisions).\nLand.\nTenix Defence provided design, manufacture, modification and repairs to all major in-service military vehicles in Australia. It had over 300 employees in &lt;a href=\"Wingfield%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Wingfield, South Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bandiana%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Bandiana, Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. Wingfield was Australia's largest privately operated military vehicle facility, offering engineering, integrated logistic support, through-life support, configuration management, prototyping, warehousing, production and paint shop facilities.\nAt Bandiana, the Land Division provided logistic and garrison support services to &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Logistics%20Command\"&gt;Joint Logistics Command&lt;/a&gt;. This included warehousing and heavy grade maintenance of artillery, guided weapons, armoured and non-armoured vehicles and other Army weapon systems. Major projects undertaken by the Land Division included LAND 106 &lt;a href=\"M113%20armored%20personnel%20carrier\"&gt;M113&lt;/a&gt; Upgrade Project\nand 10 Armoured &lt;a href=\"Limousines\"&gt;Limousines&lt;/a&gt; (based upon the &lt;a href=\"Holden%20Caprice\"&gt;Holden Caprice&lt;/a&gt;) for the &lt;a href=\"Attorney-General%27s%20Department%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Australian Attorney-General\u2019s Department&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarine.\nTenix Defence Marine Division was a major ship designer and builder in the Asia Pacific region focusing on the delivery of solutions to defence and commercial opportunities for both new build and support activities.\nNew construction, repairs and maintenance were undertaken at Australian shipyards in &lt;a href=\"Williamstown%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Williamstown, Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henderson%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Henderson, Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Both facilities also performed in-service support.
