His career began in the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;' organization, but was never called up by the MLB Giants, who moved to Weekly's home &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area\"&gt;San Francisco Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; in 1958. Instead, he was selected in the 1961 &lt;a href=\"Rule%205%20draft\"&gt;Rule 5 draft&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"expansion%20team\"&gt;expansion team&lt;/a&gt; Houston, set to enter the Majors in .

Six days later, he collected his first MLB &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt;: a solo &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt; off the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Don%20Cardwell\"&gt;Don Cardwell&lt;/a&gt; in a 6-0 Houston triumph at &lt;a href=\"Wrigley%20Field\"&gt;Wrigley Field&lt;/a&gt;.

That earned him a promotion to the Colt .45s in midseason for a 34-game stint. Weekly batted .225 with three home runs and 18 hits. His high-water mark came September 18, with three extra base hits in five &lt;a href=\"at%20bats\"&gt;at bats&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Reds&lt;/a&gt;, including two &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubles&lt;/a&gt; off Cincinnati fireballer &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Maloney\"&gt;Jim Maloney&lt;/a&gt;. He drove in four &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; and hit his fifth and final big-league homer off the Reds' &lt;a href=\"Dom%20Zanni\"&gt;Dom Zanni&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeekly made the Houston roster coming out of &lt;a href=\"spring%20training\"&gt;spring training&lt;/a&gt; in , but made only two hits in 15 at bats and returned to Oklahoma City. On June 15, he was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Orioles\"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;, but logged only nine games for the Orioles' Triple-A affiliate before returning to the Houston organization. After one more full year with the 89ers, in 1965, Weekly left professional baseball. He died from injuries sustained in a road accident in &lt;a href=\"Walnut%20Creek%2C%20California\"&gt;Walnut Creek, California&lt;/a&gt; on November 24, 1974."
