    "text": "The Unseeable (; ; literally \"Committing Adultery with Ghost\") is a &lt;a href=\"2006%20in%20film\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20Thailand\"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"horror%20film\"&gt;horror film&lt;/a&gt; directed by &lt;a href=\"Wisit%20Sasanatieng\"&gt;Wisit Sasanatieng&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first film of another writer's screenplay by the director. The writer is &lt;a href=\"Kongkiat%20Khomsiri\"&gt;Kongkiat Khomsiri&lt;/a&gt;, one of the \"Ronin Team\" credited with directing the 2005 Thai horror film \"&lt;a href=\"Art%20of%20the%20Devil%202\"&gt;Art of the Devil 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPlot.\nSet in &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Thailand%20%281932-1973%29\"&gt;1934 Siam&lt;/a&gt;, the story involves a young &lt;a href=\"pregnancy\"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; woman named Nualjan who's searching for her missing &lt;a href=\"husband\"&gt;husband&lt;/a&gt;. She comes to stay in the spooky rural mansion of a &lt;a href=\"widow\"&gt;widow&lt;/a&gt;, Runjuan. The overgrown property is managed by the stern caretaker Somchit and inhabited by a number of other people, including another young woman, Choy, who becomes Nualjin's friend, as well as an old woman, a little girl and a man who is seen at the back of the property, digging a hole.\nOrigins.\n\"The Unseeable\" marks a change for &lt;a href=\"Wisit%20Sasanatieng\"&gt;Wisit Sasanatieng&lt;/a&gt;, who made his mark with the colourful &lt;a href=\"western%20%28genre%29\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20the%20Black%20Tiger\"&gt;Tears of the Black Tiger&lt;/a&gt;\" and the romantic-comedy, \"&lt;a href=\"Mah%20Nakorn\"&gt;Citizen Dog&lt;/a&gt;\". With his third film, Wisit was restrained by budgetary concerns from the stylizations of his first two films, but in doing so he was able to make it an homage to films of the 1930s and the stars of that era, including &lt;a href=\"Bette%20Davis\"&gt;Bette Davis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Crawford\"&gt;Joan Crawford&lt;/a&gt;. Thai pop culture influences come from illustrator &lt;a href=\"Hem%20Vejakorn\"&gt;Hem Vejakorn&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote a series of 10-&lt;a href=\"satang\"&gt;satang&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"graphic%20novel\"&gt;graphic novel&lt;/a&gt; ghost stories in the 1930s and '40s. The reference was so striking that the Barom Khru Foundation, which claims to supervise Hem's works, issued a statement warning &lt;a href=\"Five%20Star%20Production\"&gt;Five Star Production&lt;/a&gt; to not violate the copyright of Hem's work. However, Wisit said the film was not an &lt;a href=\"adaptation\"&gt;adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of any of Hem's works but was generally inspired by Hem's style."
