    "text": "The Siege of Barcelona of 1697 was successfully conducted during the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Nine Years' War&lt;/a&gt; by France. &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Joseph%2C%20Duke%20of%20Vend%C3%B4me\"&gt;Louis Joseph, Duke of Vend\u00f4me&lt;/a&gt;, commanding some 32,000 troops (reinforced with troops from the ended Italian front of the war), forced the garrison, under &lt;a href=\"Prince%20George%20of%20Hesse-Darmstadt\"&gt;Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt&lt;/a&gt;, to capitulate on 10 August. Nevertheless, it had been a hard fought contest: according to John Lynn, French casualties totalled around 9,000, while the losses on the Spanish side were 12,000 killed, wounded, or lost, although Antonio Espino L\u00f3pez has set the figure for Spanish losses at 4,500 killed and 800 wounded, and the French casualties at 15,000, including 52 engineers."
