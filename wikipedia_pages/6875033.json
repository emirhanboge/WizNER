Her birth year is uncertain as sources are contradictory. The Twillingate Sun newspaper notes that she was 68 when she died but there is no obituary to confirm her birth year. \nShe was educated at Twillingate and &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; and went on to study singing in Paris, Italy and Germany. She had taken the stage name \"Toulinguet\" which was the original French name for Twillingate. At the age of fifteen she played as a church organist in her hometown and early in her career had been instrumental in the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Dorcas%20Society\"&gt;Dorcas Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile in Paris, Stirling had studied under the tutorship of Madame &lt;a href=\"Mathilde%20Marchesi\"&gt;Mathilde Marchesi&lt;/a&gt; where she was discovered by a &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; opera company. She toured and accepted engagements with many operas such as the Opera Company of New York City, the Boston Harmony Orchestral Society and the &lt;a href=\"Scalchi%20Opera%20Company\"&gt;Scalchi Opera Company&lt;/a&gt;. At the peak of her career she had developed a throat ailment that cut her singing career short. She eventually made a comeback as concert artist.\nStirling had returned to her hometown of Twillingate to live with her sister Rose where she eventually died on April 23, 1935 Easter Sunday.
