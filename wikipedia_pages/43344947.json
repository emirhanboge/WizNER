There were 18 teams competing in the league, the same as the &lt;a href=\"2014%20AFL%20season\"&gt;previous year&lt;/a&gt;. The first game was played on Thursday, 2 April, and the &lt;a href=\"2015%20AFL%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; was played on Saturday, 3 October, with defeating by 46 points to win its 13th premiership and its third in successive years.\n&lt;a href=\"Nat%20Fyfe\"&gt;Nat Fyfe&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"Brownlow%20Medal\"&gt;Brownlow Medal&lt;/a&gt;, voted by the umpires to be the &lt;a href=\"best%20and%20fairest\"&gt;best and fairest&lt;/a&gt; player in the league for the home-and-away season. &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Kennedy%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201987%29\"&gt;Josh Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"Coleman%20Medal\"&gt;Coleman Medal&lt;/a&gt; as the highest goal scorer in the competition.\nThe season was marred by the mid-season death of senior coach &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Walsh%20%28Australian%20footballer%29\"&gt;Phil Walsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-season.\nAll Stars game.\nThe biennial All Stars game, this year played in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, featuring an AFL team and the &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20All-Stars%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29\"&gt;Indigenous All Stars&lt;/a&gt; team made up of some of the best &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australians\"&gt;Indigenous&lt;/a&gt; players in the game, returned for the 2015 pre-season. The &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Eagles\"&gt;West Coast Eagles&lt;/a&gt; were selected as the AFL team to play in the game, which was played at &lt;a href=\"Leederville%20Oval\"&gt;Medibank Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;.\nNAB Challenge.\nFor the second consecutive year, the NAB Challenge series took place, featuring 27 practice matches played over 25 days, beginning 26 February and ending 22 March. The matches were stand-alone in nature, with no overall winner crowned for the series. Each team played three pre-season games, many of which were played at suburban or regional venues, with most games televised on &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Footy\"&gt;Fox Footy&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Super%20Goal\"&gt;Super Goal&lt;/a&gt; was retained for these matches.\nPremiership season.\nNotable features of the draw include:\nWin/loss table.\nBold\u00a0\u2013 Home game\nX\u00a0\u2013 Bye\nC\u00a0\u2013 Cancelled\nOpponent for round listed above margin\nLadder.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-season.\nInternational Rules Series.\nThe &lt;a href=\"International%20Rules%20Series\"&gt;International Rules Series&lt;/a&gt; returned in November 2015, with Ireland entitled to the hosting rights.

A highly qualified Australian side, who were looking for back-to-back series wins, fell to a classy Irish team by 4 points.\nNotable events and controversies.\nDoping and drugs.\nThe AFL suffered significant bad publicity during 2015 related to four cases of illicit substance abuse in AFL clubs \u2013 three related to doping and one related to recreational drugs:\nDeath of Phil Walsh.\nIn the early hours of Friday 3 July 2015, coach &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Walsh%20%28Australian%20footballer%29\"&gt;Phil Walsh&lt;/a&gt; was found dead at his Adelaide residency following a domestic violence incident; he was killed by his son, Cy, who was charged with his murder, and ultimately found not guilty due to mental incompetence, meaning he is now subject to a lifetime psychiatric supervision order and is permanently detained at the James Nash House forensic Mental Health Facility. Walsh's wife Meredith also suffered injuries in the incident. In the immediate aftermath, the match between Adelaide and Geelong, which was to have been played on Sunday 5 July, was cancelled, with the clubs sharing two premiership points each. At the remaining seven matches of the round ( and had already played on Thursday night), respect was paid to Walsh by observing moments of silence both before and after the match; and pre- and post-match celebrations or promotions, including the playing of club songs and running through banners, were not carried out."
