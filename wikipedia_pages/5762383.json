    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Troubles\"&gt;Troubles&lt;/a&gt; were a period of conflict in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; involving &lt;a href=\"Irish%20republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulster%20loyalism\"&gt;loyalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paramilitary\"&gt;paramilitaries&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Law%20enforcement%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British security forces&lt;/a&gt;, and civil rights groups. They are usually dated from the late 1960s through to the &lt;a href=\"Good%20Friday%20Agreement\"&gt;Good Friday Agreement&lt;/a&gt; of 1998. However, sporadic violence continued after this point. Those that continued violence past this point are referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"dissident%20republican\"&gt;dissident republican&lt;/a&gt;s and loyalists\". By 1998 the Troubles had claimed roughly 3500 lives.\nPrior to 1960.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Partition%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;partition&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Republican%20Army%20%281922%E2%80%9369%29\"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt; had started a number of military operations in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; designed at bringing about their goal of a &lt;a href=\"United%20Ireland\"&gt;United Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The intensity of this activity increased towards the end of 1941, where the IRA decided to step up its &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Campaign%20%28Irish%20Republican%20Army%29\"&gt;campaign of attacks in Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. In response to this activity the Unionist authorities under &lt;a href=\"J.%20M.%20Andrews\"&gt;John Miller Andrews&lt;/a&gt; introduced internment and using provisions of the &lt;a href=\"Emergency%20Powers%20Act%20%28Northern%20Ireland%29%201926\"&gt;Emergency Powers Act&lt;/a&gt;, instituted increasingly restrictive policies in Northern Ireland. This pattern of paramilitary violence, followed by increasingly restrictive measures on the behalf of the authorities came to define the run-up to the Troubles.\n1960\u20131969.\nSince 1964, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20civil-rights%20movement%20%281960s%29\"&gt;civil rights activists&lt;/a&gt; had been protesting against the discrimination against &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Catholic\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Irish%20nationalism\"&gt;Irish nationalists&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Ulster%20Protestant\"&gt;Ulster Protestant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unionism%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;unionist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"government%20of%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;government of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The civil rights movement called for: '&lt;a href=\"one%20man%2C%20one%20vote\"&gt;one man, one vote&lt;/a&gt;'; the end to &lt;a href=\"Gerrymandering\"&gt;gerrymandered&lt;/a&gt; electoral boundaries; the end to discrimination in employment and in the allocation of public housing; repeal of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Authorities%20%28Special%20Powers%29%20Act%20%28Northern%20Ireland%29%201922\"&gt;Special Powers Act&lt;/a&gt;; and the disbanding of the &lt;a href=\"Ulster%20Special%20Constabulary\"&gt;Ulster Special Constabulary&lt;/a&gt;."
