    "text": "William \"Mother\" Elliot , also known as Bill, (9 May 1867 \u2013 16 April 1958) was a New Zealand &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; footballer who toured with the &lt;a href=\"1888%E2%80%9389%20New%20Zealand%20Native%20football%20team\"&gt;1888\u201389 New Zealand Native football team&lt;/a&gt;. Elliot was one of five &lt;a href=\"P%C4%81keh%C4%81\"&gt;P\u0101keh\u0101&lt;/a&gt; (European) players in the predominantly &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ori%20people\"&gt;M\u0101ori&lt;/a&gt; team, and his addition strengthened the side. Playing at &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Scrum-half\"&gt;half-back&lt;/a&gt;, he became one of the most prolific players on the tour, and appeared in at least 86 of their 107 matches in the British Isles, Australia and New Zealand. While on tour he played in all three of the internationals against England, Ireland, and Wales. When he returned from the tour he continued to play provincial rugby for &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, whom he represented from 1887 to 1896. Before he departed with the Natives he had twice represented Auckland against the touring &lt;a href=\"British%20and%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British side&lt;/a&gt;, and had scored a &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; against them in the second match, a 4\u20130 victory for Auckland. He was initially selected for &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; for their 1893 tour of Australia, but was unable to secure leave from work."
