    "text": "Titelberg () is the site of a large &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; settlement or &lt;a href=\"oppidum\"&gt;oppidum&lt;/a&gt; in the extreme south west of &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1st century BC, this thriving community was probably the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Treveri\"&gt;Treveri&lt;/a&gt; people. The site thus provides telling evidence of urban civilization in the century before the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20empire\"&gt;Roman conquest&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe site lies some 3\u00a0km to the south west of &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A9tange\"&gt;P\u00e9tange&lt;/a&gt; and 3\u00a0km north west of &lt;a href=\"Differdange\"&gt;Differdange&lt;/a&gt; on a bare plateau some 390 m above sea level. It is surrounded by steep forested slopes which run down to the &lt;a href=\"Chiers\"&gt;Chiers&lt;/a&gt;, a hundred meters below. It can be reached from &lt;a href=\"Niedercorn\"&gt;Niedercorn&lt;/a&gt; by taking the road to Roudenhaff and making a right turn towards the Fond de Gras.\nBackground.\nThe Celts inhabited large areas of Europe from the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Rhine\"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rh%C3%B4ne%20River\"&gt;Rh\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt; during the 6th to 1st centuries BC, a period sometimes referred to as &lt;a href=\"La%20T%C3%A8ne%20culture\"&gt;La T\u00e8ne&lt;/a&gt; after a site in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; where continental Celtic remains were first discovered. It was around 100 BC that the &lt;a href=\"Treveri\"&gt;Treveri&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20tribes\"&gt;Celtic tribes&lt;/a&gt;, came into a period of prosperity. They constructed a number of settlements or \"oppida\" near the &lt;a href=\"Moselle%20%28river%29\"&gt;Moselle&lt;/a&gt; valley in what is now southern &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;, western &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and eastern &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. Titelberg was by far the largest of the Treveri settlements, no doubt as a result of its proximity to two of the most important Celtic roads, one from the south connecting the Rhone to the &lt;a href=\"upper%20Moselle\"&gt;upper Moselle&lt;/a&gt; and the north, the other leading to &lt;a href=\"Reims\"&gt;Reims&lt;/a&gt; and the west. Another attraction were the &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; which could be mined in the immediate vicinity and fertile lands.\nThe site.\nCovering an area of some 50 ha, the oval-shaped Titelberg plateau is approximately 1\u00a0km long (NW to SE) and 500 m wide. It was occupied continuously for 700 years from about 300 BC. There is evidence of sporadic settlements dating back even further, perhaps to 2000 BC or before. From the 1st century BC and during the &lt;a href=\"Gallo-Roman\"&gt;Gallo-Roman&lt;/a&gt; period, foundations of masonry replaced the earlier, less durable constructions. These, together with the 9-m high earthen ramparts around the periphery, clearly demonstrate the importance of the Celtic oppidum which appears to have been the seat of the Treveri chiefs.\nAlthough some interest had been shown in the site in 1928, serious archaeological excavations began in 1968 and continue today. These have been coordinated by Luxembourg's &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20History%20and%20Art\"&gt;National Museum of History and Art&lt;/a&gt; with the assistance of specialists from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Missouri\"&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960s. In particular, the digs have unearthed the main residential area in the centre of the plateau and the public or recreational area, a few hundred meters to the south east. Both are located to the west of the farm road through the site which loosely follows the path of the main Celtic road that connects the two gates of the oppidum. There is also evidence of metal working and coin-minting activities long before the Roman conquest.\nCeltic period.\nWhile there is evidence that the site was probably inhabited as far back as 2000 BC, the beginnings of urban civilization can certainly be traced back to the 2nd century BC when there were bronze-working shops at the site. In the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD, the oppidum had become a civilized community trading with other Gallic centres. The Treveri nobles appear to have occupied the dwellings at the centre of the plateau. The Celtic tombs excavated in the vicinity, specifically at &lt;a href=\"Clemency%2C%20Luxembourg\"&gt;Clemency&lt;/a&gt;, at \"Scheierheck\" near &lt;a href=\"Goeblange\"&gt;Goeblange&lt;/a&gt; and at \"Kreckelbierg\" near &lt;a href=\"Nospelt\"&gt;Nospelt&lt;/a&gt; contain a range of articles including wine flagons, spurs, knives, lances and oil lanterns testifying to the aristocracy of those buried.\nThe entire site was originally surrounded by 10 m high, reinforced ramparts of &lt;a href=\"Murus%20Gallicus\"&gt;Murus Gallicus&lt;/a&gt; type, with fortified doors at either end of the main road through the site. The ramparts then collapsed over the years due to the lack of maintenance after the Roman conquest.\nA deep ditch, 4 m wide, perpendicular to the road, separated the residential space from the public space. The residential area covering about 30 ha consisted of rectangular houses, 14 m long by 8 m wide, built of light masonry. They were equipped with fireplaces and sometimes ovens. Trenches to drain rain water among the houses were also discovered. In the public space, the remains of a large hall, 14 m square, have been found, but no dwellings were discovered. This could have been a meeting place for political, economical and/or religious purposes.\nOne of the most important finds on Titelberg has been a huge number of Celtic coins which come not only from the Treveri themselves but from several other Celtic tribes. This indicates that it was a centre of trade and commerce during the Celtic period. In addition, facilities for minting coins have also been excavated close to the residential area and appear to have been used over an extended period.\nA very large number of both Celtic and Gallo-Roman &lt;a href=\"fibula%20%28brooch%29\"&gt;fibulae&lt;/a&gt; have also been found on the site. In a multitude of different shapes and sizes, these bronze clasps, sometimes hinged, were used either as ornamental brooches or for holding garments together.\nGallo-Roman period.\nAbout 20 years after the Roman conquest, the Celtic oppidum was completely reworked and at least two streets perpendicular to the main were constructed. The houses too were replaced with Roman buildings which had stone foundations and cellars.\nThe Treveri, despite their conflictual relationship with the Roman world, apparently adopted Roman culture and religion fairly quickly, even long before the Roman conquest. Titelberg, though no longer a capital, became a prosperous &lt;a href=\"Vicus%20%28Rome%29\"&gt;vicus&lt;/a&gt; with a range of activities, especially metal working. In particular, minting of coins and smelting extended at least until around 337 as one of the coins found at the site of the smelter bears the likeness of &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20II%20%28emperor%29\"&gt;Constantine II&lt;/a&gt;. In the former public area, a square-shaped monumental Gallo-Roman edifice was built among dwellings and later transformed into a traditional Gallo-Roman fanum, a square-shaped temple with a roofed porch on all sides of its sacred room.\nSimilar sites.\nTitelberg resembles a number of other Celtic oppidum sites. In particular, &lt;a href=\"Bibracte\"&gt;Bibracte&lt;/a&gt;, probably the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Aedui\"&gt;Aedui&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Autun\"&gt;Autun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; has similar dimensions and fortifications. &lt;a href=\"Oppidum%20of%20Manching\"&gt;Manching&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; is a considerably larger site and &lt;a href=\"Oppidum%20d%27Ens%C3%A9rune\"&gt;Ens\u00e9rune&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9ziers\"&gt;B\u00e9ziers&lt;/a&gt; in southern France also has a hilltop position."
