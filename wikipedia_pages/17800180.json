    "text": "The 1997 Nokia Sugar Bowl was the 63rd edition to the annual &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt; game and served as the &lt;a href=\"Bowl%20Alliance\"&gt;Bowl Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s designated national championship game for the &lt;a href=\"1996%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season\"&gt;1996 season&lt;/a&gt;. It matched No. 1 &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; (ACC) against No. 3 &lt;a href=\"1996%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Conference\"&gt;Southeastern Conference&lt;/a&gt; (SEC). Florida defeated Florida State in convincing fashion, with a final score of 52\u201320, and with the victory earned its first-ever consensus national championship. This was the only National Championship game to feature two teams from the same state.\nTeams.\nThe game was a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20college%20football%20post-season%20games%20that%20were%20rematches%20of%20regular%20season%20games\"&gt;bowl rematch of a regular season game&lt;/a&gt;, as Florida State had defeated Florida, 24\u201321, in a game played in &lt;a href=\"Tallahassee%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Tallahassee&lt;/a&gt; on November 30.\nThird-ranked Florida was invited to the designated national championship game because the &lt;a href=\"Pacific-10%20Conference\"&gt;Pac-10&lt;/a&gt; champion was contractually obligated to play in the &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Bowl%20Game\"&gt;Rose Bowl Game&lt;/a&gt;, and unavailable to participate in the &lt;a href=\"Bowl%20Alliance\"&gt;Bowl Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, second-ranked &lt;a href=\"1996%20Arizona%20State%20Sun%20Devils%20football%20team\"&gt;Arizona State&lt;/a&gt;, the Pac-10 champion, played the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten\"&gt;Big Ten&lt;/a&gt; champion, fourth-ranked &lt;a href=\"1996%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football%20team\"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"1997%20Rose%20Bowl\"&gt;1997 Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. When Ohio State defeated Arizona State in the Rose Bowl on January 1, the Sugar Bowl winner was all but assured of being named the consensus national champion.\nFlorida Gators.\nThe Gators were led by their &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt;-winning quarterback, &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Wuerffel\"&gt;Danny Wuerffel&lt;/a&gt;. They completed their regular season schedule with a 10\u20131 record, then defeated No. 11 &lt;a href=\"1996%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1996%20SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;1996 SEC Championship Game&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlorida State Seminoles.\nTop-ranked Florida State entered the bowl with an undefeated 11\u20130 record, led by quarterback &lt;a href=\"Thad%20Busby\"&gt;Thad Busby&lt;/a&gt; and running back &lt;a href=\"Warrick%20Dunn\"&gt;Warrick Dunn&lt;/a&gt;.\nGame summary.\nAfter a halftime score of 24\u201317 in favor of Florida, Florida State closed to 24\u201320 with a third quarter field goal. Florida then outscored Florida State 28\u20130 for the remainder of the game, for a 52\u201320 final. Gator quarterback Danny Wuerffel threw three touchdown passes to &lt;a href=\"Ike%20Hilliard\"&gt;Ike Hilliard&lt;/a&gt; in the game, and ran for another score. Wuerffel became the second Heisman Trophy winner in four years to win a national championship, following &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Ward\"&gt;Charlie Ward&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"1993%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team\"&gt;1993 Florida State&lt;/a&gt; team.\nScoring summary.\nSource:"
