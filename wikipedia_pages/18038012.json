    "text": "Vahram Kevorkian (17 December 1887 in the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 17 July 1911 in &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;) was a &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player of &lt;a href=\"Armenians\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; descent. His position on the field was &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Striker\"&gt;striker&lt;/a&gt;.\nKevorkian was born in a rich merchant family in &lt;a href=\"Yerevan\"&gt;Yerevan&lt;/a&gt;, and had been sent to study in &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;. He arrived in Belgium presumably in 1902, after he had been studying in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. He settled in &lt;a href=\"Bruges\"&gt;Bruges&lt;/a&gt; and also started playing football for &lt;a href=\"Cercle%20Brugge\"&gt;Cercle Brugge&lt;/a&gt; in 1902. He made his debut at the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20First%20Division\"&gt;highest level&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;Belgian football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20First%20Division%201903-04\"&gt;one season later&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20First%20Division%201905-06\"&gt;1905&lt;/a&gt;, Kevorkian went to Antwerp side &lt;a href=\"K.%20Beerschot%20V.A.C.\"&gt;Beerschot&lt;/a&gt;. Even though Beerschot relegated that season, Kevorkian chose to stay and Antwerp were back again at the top level in &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20First%20Division%201907-08\"&gt;1907&lt;/a&gt;.\nKevorkian was called up for &lt;a href=\"Belgium%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; in 1908, for a match against &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. Kevorkian scored the 1\u20130 in the 30th minute. Belgium won the match 2\u20131. Even though Kevorkian did not have the Belgian nationality, he was allowed to appear in the match. Because when the rule started counting that players had to have the nationality of the country they were playing for, Kevorkian was already playing in Belgium. Such players were still allowed too. (&lt;a href=\"grandfather%20clause\"&gt;grandfather clause&lt;/a&gt;)\nHe played the last match of his career with Beerschot against his former team Cercle Brugge. The match ended in a 2\u20132 draw. Shortly afterwards, Kevorkian had to undergo surgery for his &lt;a href=\"appendicitis\"&gt;appendicitis&lt;/a&gt;. However, Kevorkian's situation &lt;a href=\"complication%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;worsened&lt;/a&gt; after the surgery. He died on 17 July 1911."
