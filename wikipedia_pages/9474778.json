    "text": "Basel SBB railway station (, or in earlier times \"Centralbahnhof\" or \"Schweizer Bahnhof\") is the central &lt;a href=\"railway%20station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Basel\"&gt;Basel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. Opened in 1854, and completely rebuilt in 1900\u20131907, it is Europe's busiest international border station. As its name suggests, Basel SBB is owned by the &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Federal%20Railways\"&gt;Swiss Federal Railways&lt;/a&gt; (SBB\u00a0CFF\u00a0FFS). The other major railway station in Basel is &lt;a href=\"Basel%20Badischer%20Bahnhof\"&gt;Basel Badischer Bahnhof&lt;/a&gt;, which is on the north side of the &lt;a href=\"Rhine\"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt; from the city centre.\nTrains operated by SBB\u00a0CFF\u00a0FFS use Basel SBB to link Basel with destinations within Switzerland and Italy, as do &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Bahn\"&gt;Deutsche Bahn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Intercity-Express\"&gt;Intercity-Express&lt;/a&gt; (ICE) trains to and from &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, Z\u00fcrich and Interlaken, most &lt;a href=\"SNCF\"&gt;SNCF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Train%20%C3%A0%20grande%20vitesse\"&gt;TGV&lt;/a&gt; trains to and from &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href=\"regional%20rail\"&gt;regional trains&lt;/a&gt; to and from &lt;a href=\"Alsace\"&gt;Alsace&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the station is served by three lines of the &lt;a href=\"Basel%20Regional%20S-Bahn\"&gt;Basel S-Bahn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 1907 &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;neo-baroque&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"station%20building\"&gt;station building&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20inventory%20of%20cultural%20property%20of%20national%20and%20regional%20significance\"&gt;heritage site of national significance&lt;/a&gt;. It also contains B\u00e2le SNCF (shown in SBB\u00a0CFF\u00a0FFS online timetables as Basel SBB Gl. 30-35, and in other online timetables as Basel SNCF), which is located through a &lt;a href=\"border%20crossing\"&gt;border crossing&lt;/a&gt; and is used by other trains to and from &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. Directly outside the station building is the Centralbahnplatz, which is a major hub of the &lt;a href=\"Trams%20in%20Basel\"&gt;Basel tramway network&lt;/a&gt;, and the Basel terminus of a direct bus service to the &lt;a href=\"EuroAirport%20Basel%20Mulhouse%20Freiburg\"&gt;EuroAirport&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nThe station area is situated at the southern side of the city centre, in an elongated area between the &lt;a href=\"Zoo%20Basel\"&gt;Zoological Garden&lt;/a&gt; to the west and the to the east.\nThe borders of four of Basel's districts come together at the station area. However, the area is, according to the Statistical Office, divided between only two districts: the station itself is located in , while most of the tracks on the eastern side of the station (including the &lt;a href=\"goods%20station\"&gt;goods station&lt;/a&gt;), along with the Centralbahnplatz in front of the station (including the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20for%20International%20Settlements\"&gt;BIS Tower&lt;/a&gt;), are attributed to the .\nThe Elisabethenanlage in front of the Centralbahnplatz belongs to , while the opposite Basel SNCF is part of the district.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nThe first railway to reach Basel, the (StB; Strasbourg Basel Railway), arrived there in 1844. The following year, 1845, the \"Els\u00e4sserbahn\" (Alsatian Railway) built the first station in the Basel metropolitan area, within the city walls. Basel thereby became the first Swiss city to be connected to the new means of transport.\nAfter the arrival of the railway, there was a passionate debate in Basel about the pros and cons of the railway and its possible continuation towards &lt;a href=\"Lucerne\"&gt;Lucerne&lt;/a&gt; and from there through the &lt;a href=\"Gotthard%20Pass\"&gt;Gotthard&lt;/a&gt; towards Italy.\nMeanwhile, the \"&lt;a href=\"Mannheim%E2%80%93Karlsruhe%E2%80%93Basel%20railway\"&gt;Rheintalbahn&lt;/a&gt;\" from &lt;a href=\"Mannheim\"&gt;Mannheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karlsruhe\"&gt;Karlsruhe&lt;/a&gt; also approached Basel from the north; in 1851 it reached &lt;a href=\"Haltingen\"&gt;Haltingen&lt;/a&gt; (a district of &lt;a href=\"Weil%20am%20Rhein\"&gt;Weil am Rhein&lt;/a&gt;), on the Swiss border.\nIn 1853, the \"&lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Central%20Railway\"&gt;Schweizerische Centralbahn&lt;/a&gt;\" railway company (SCB) was founded in Basel. Its purpose was the establishment of a link between the city of Basel and the economic centres of the &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Plateau\"&gt;Mittelland cantons&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps even also the expansion of the transport corridor from &lt;a href=\"Lucerne\"&gt;Lucerne&lt;/a&gt; to the Gotthard.\nThe Viaduktstrasse in Basel \u2013 including the , which is adjacent to the Zoo Basel parking lot \u2013 was also the formation of the \"Els\u00e4sserbahn\" until 1902. Today, the viaduct serves tram lines 1 and 8, as well as motor vehicle traffic, and a plaque on the bridge railing recalls its earlier role as a rail bridge.\nProvisional station.\nIn 1854, construction on the future &lt;a href=\"Hauenstein%20railway%20line\"&gt;Hauenstein railway line&lt;/a&gt; began. Right up until the opening of the first section of the route from Basel to Liestal, the controversial question of the site and design of the Basel railway station remained unresolved.\nHowever, to accommodate the commencement of railway operations on 19 December 1854, the \"Centralbahn\" built a simple temporary timber structure, according to plans developed by chief architect Ludwig Maring. By the opening day, all of the temporary station buildings had been completed, including a timber &lt;a href=\"train%20shed\"&gt;train shed&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis modest provisional station, equipped with makeshift facilities, was made up of individual detached buildings and was used only for just under six years. The station site consisted of the &lt;a href=\"station%20building\"&gt;station building&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"goods%20shed\"&gt;goods shed&lt;/a&gt;, a carriage and &lt;a href=\"locomotive%20shed\"&gt;locomotive shed&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Railway%20turntable\"&gt;turntable&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"railhead\"&gt;railhead&lt;/a&gt;. As the station building stood on the northeastern side of the station, alongside the &lt;a href=\"station%20yard\"&gt;station yard&lt;/a&gt;, the station was not configured as a &lt;a href=\"terminal%20station\"&gt;terminus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe provisional station served only as the starting point of the SCB lines, and had no connection with either the French station or the Badischer Bahnhof, which was opened in 1855 as the terminus of the Rheintalbahn.\nCentralbahnhof.\nOn 29 June 1857, the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council%20of%20Basel-Stadt\"&gt;Grand Council of Basel-Stadt&lt;/a&gt; agreed to the construction of a link between the French line and the \"Centralbahn\" and the erection of a &lt;a href=\"through%20station\"&gt;through station&lt;/a&gt; in the field in front of the \"Elisabethen-&lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bollwerk&lt;/a&gt;\". The city bore the cost of the land purchase.\nAt the start of 1859, the SCB began construction work on the site of the new station, to a design by Maring. In addition to a passenger station, the new station yard featured a goods station relocated to the Gundeldingen district, and two new locomotive sheds, one of them for the SCB, and the other for the \"&lt;a href=\"Chemins%20de%20fer%20de%20l%27Est\"&gt;Chemins de fer de l'Est&lt;/a&gt;\", which had taken over the StB in 1854.\nOn 4 June 1860, railway operations began at the new Basel Centralbahnhof. However, it was not until May 1861 that all the new facilities were completed.\nThe Centralbahnhof was a &lt;a href=\"union%20station\"&gt;joint station&lt;/a&gt;, with the northern facade of its station building facing the newly created Centralbahnplatz. On each side of the station building were the boarding halls, each with two tracks \u2013 on the eastern side for the Swiss trains and on the western side and for the French trains. To the south of the station building were the goods shed and two large warehouses, with an access road from the G\u00fcterstrasse.\nIn subsequent years, modifications were made to the Centralbahnhof to enable it to deal with its substantially increasing traffic, including trains entering and leaving Basel along a number of new lines:\nHowever, the Centralbahnhof eventually ran out of capacity to handle any further additional traffic.\nIn 1875, as a first measure of relief, the &lt;a href=\"classification%20yard\"&gt;marshalling&lt;/a&gt; of freight trains was relocated to a makeshift yard to the east of the station, on an open field known as \"auf dem Wolf\". At around that time, discussions began with the aim of lowering the tracks and replacing the troublesome urban &lt;a href=\"level%20crossings\"&gt;level crossings&lt;/a&gt; on the \"Els\u00e4sserbahn\" and at the Centralbahnhof. In 1874, provisional timber pedestrian bridges had already been built at Margarethenstrasse und Heumattstrasse; they were later replaced by iron structures. From 1879, the Pfeffingerstrasse passed underneath the station in a tunnel near the present location of the Peter Merian Bridge.\nFinally, in 1898, following the referendum on the nationalisation of Switzerland's railways, the &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Federal%20Council\"&gt;Swiss Federal Council&lt;/a&gt; decided to go ahead with the following:\nProvisional new Centralbahnhof.\nThe definitive project for a new Centralbahnhof in Basel was developed in 1899. On 16 March 1900, the Federal Council gave approval to the plans.\nThe lowering of the whole station area and the access lines required careful planning. The first step was the relocation of goods traffic to the Wolf station, and on 12 May 1901 the Alsace line was reopened in its new lower position and wide arc.\nOn the vacated, lowered, area south of the original Centralbahnhof, the provisional station was built, and on 2 June 1902 it went into operation.\nAccess to the provisional station was also from the south, via G\u00fcterstrasse. To facilitate access, various streets were extended, as were two tram lines. The provisional station remained in operation until 24 June 1907. The provisional facilities and access roads were then dismantled and the two tram lines laid into G\u00fcterstrasse. A station underpass to Gundeldingen was built roughly in the location of the provisional access road.\nIn 1902-1903, the old station was torn down.\nBasel SBB station.\nIn 1902, the \"Schweizerische Centralbahn\" was absorbed by the newly formed Swiss Federal Railways (SBB\u00a0CFF\u00a0FFS). The new station, which from then onwards was referred to as \"Schweizer Bundesbahnhof\" or \"Basel SBB\", was one of the new Federal Railways' first large building projects. Designed by &lt;a href=\"Emil%20Faesch\"&gt;Emil Faesch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emmanuel%20La%20Roche\"&gt;Emmanuel La Roche&lt;/a&gt;, the new station was inaugurated on 24 June 1907.\nThe Basel SBB station building is characterized by its extraordinary length: Basel SNCF, with its customs facility for the international transit traffic, is \"attached\" to its western side. The asymmetrical layout of the station creates an external appearance representative of the federal buildings of the time. The station building is aligned to the centre line of the Centralbahnplatz, and features a huge glazed &lt;a href=\"tudor%20arch\"&gt;tudor arch window&lt;/a&gt; between two clock towers under curved domes.\nBehind the facade, one might suspect a terminus, but that is not the case in Basel. Through the entrances in the clock towers, travellers reach the ticket hall under a timber-lined steel-arch structure. Like the rest of the interior, the ticket hall is broad and high. Large murals dating from the 1920s advertise tourist destinations in Switzerland. The ticket and currency exchange offices are embedded in the side wall. The baggage check-in and hand luggage storage facilities were formerly also located here, but today they are in the basement, and accessed by means of an escalator and stairs.\nIn the eastern part of the station, the baggage claim was formerly to be found where the travel centre is now located. The first/second class restaurants (now Migros) and the third class facility (now a brasserie/kiosk) were in the north west wing. The station was previously known for its station buffets, but these were gradually closed down in the 1990s. The high rooms, their walls decorated with murals, now house other commercial uses together with the sole remaining specialty restaurant.\nA separate entrance, on the Centralbahnstrasse west of the Centralbahnplatz, leads to the Alsace-bound trains at Basel SNCF. \nInitially, the &lt;a href=\"railway%20platform\"&gt;platform allocation&lt;/a&gt; at Basel SBB corresponded to the private railway age, because the platforms were separated according to the direction of travel. The station originally had 10 tracks, of which the three &lt;a href=\"bay%20platform\"&gt;bay platform&lt;/a&gt;s 1 to 3 were previously reserved for local traffic. Tracks 1 to 10 are spanned by a five aisle train shed, which was created in 1905 by of Pratteln in Basel. The train shed is wide, and has a length of (tracks 1/2), (tracks 3/4) and (tracks 5-10). Track 4 goes through to Basel SNCF, where it becomes track 30 and the &lt;a href=\"Overhead%20lines\"&gt;catenary&lt;/a&gt; can be switched from the Swiss operating current of 15 &lt;a href=\"Volt\"&gt;kV&lt;/a&gt; 16.7 &lt;a href=\"Hertz\"&gt;Hz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alternating%20current\"&gt;AC&lt;/a&gt; to its French equivalent, 25 kV 50\u00a0Hz AC.\nOn the southern side of the station, a double track line, located at a lower level, connects the Basel and Muttenz marshalling yards with the line to France, and is devoted mainly to through freight trains.\nDue to the lowering of the tracks at the time of rebuilding, it was difficult to extend the station with additional tracks. On the South side, the platform system has nevertheless been augmented several times: tracks 11 and 12 have been added, the &lt;a href=\"subway%20%28underpass%29\"&gt;pedestrian underpass&lt;/a&gt; has been extended to Gundeldingen, and, in 2003, the new Passerelle was constructed to the new tracks 14 and 15. These changes, together with the introduction of a &lt;a href=\"clock-face%20scheduling\"&gt;clock-face timetable&lt;/a&gt; in 1982 and the &lt;a href=\"Rail%202000\"&gt;Rail 2000&lt;/a&gt; project, achieved an increase in the station's capacity. Finally, in June 2008, the new tracks 16 and 17 went into operation.\nThe Passerelle is an element of the new SBB\u00a0CFF\u00a0FFS commercial concept known as RailCity. Designed by architects Cruz and Ortiz, it runs over the tracks from the ticket hall at the western end of the train shed to the district of Gundeldingen, and links the platforms with each other. A &lt;a href=\"shopping%20arcade\"&gt;walkway with shopping opportunities&lt;/a&gt;, it is long, wide, and replaced the pedestrian underpass. Today, the former underpass is used for operational and logistical purposes.\nWith the construction of the Passerelle, the RailCenter and the information display were relocated from the ticket hall to the former luggage hall. Additionally, the 1987-built customer service ticket pavilion in the ticket hall was removed, and since then the ticket hall has been able to unfold its ambience to its fullest extent.\nMeanwhile, in 1998 and 1999, a new &lt;a href=\"signal%20box\"&gt;signal box&lt;/a&gt; was constructed on behalf of the SBB\u00a0CFF\u00a0FFS. The architects of this striking building were &lt;a href=\"Herzog%20%26amp%3B%20de%20Meuron\"&gt;Herzog &amp; de Meuron&lt;/a&gt;.\nConnections.\nOverview.\nAbout 1,000 trains depart from the station daily. Nearly every 90 seconds, a passenger train leaves or stops at the station. Additionally, freight trains still use the through tracks, and post office trains enter and exit the underground postal station.\nInternational long-distance trains.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Intercity-Express\"&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt; departs from Basel SBB every hour to &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Hauptbahnhof\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hamburg%20Hbf\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; and a number of other German cities. There is also a daily ICE International connection to Amsterdam. Several times a day, &lt;a href=\"EuroCity\"&gt;EuroCity&lt;/a&gt;s run to &lt;a href=\"Milano%20Centrale%20railway%20station\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Train%20%C3%A0%20grande%20vitesse\"&gt;TGV&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Gare%20de%20Lyon\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. Night connections exist with Berlin, and Hamburg. There used to be a direct connection to &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; but as of 2014 this has been discontinued.\nNational long-distance trains.\nSeveral times hourly, &lt;a href=\"InterCity\"&gt;InterCity&lt;/a&gt; trains run to &lt;a href=\"Z%C3%BCrich%20HB\"&gt;Z\u00fcrich HB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bern%20railway%20station\"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Olten%20railway%20station\"&gt;Olten&lt;/a&gt;. At least hourly, Z\u00fcrich\u2013&lt;a href=\"Chur%20railway%20station\"&gt;Chur&lt;/a&gt;, Olten\u2013&lt;a href=\"Lucerne%20railway%20station\"&gt;Lucerne&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Bellinzona%20railway%20station\"&gt;Bellinzona&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Lugano%20railway%20station\"&gt;Lugano&lt;/a&gt;, Olten\u2013Bern\u2013&lt;a href=\"Interlaken%20Ost%20railway%20station\"&gt;Interlaken&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Visp%20railway%20station\"&gt;Visp&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Brig%20railway%20station\"&gt;Brig&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Del%C3%A9mont%20railway%20station\"&gt;Del\u00e9mont&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Biel/Bienne%20railway%20station\"&gt;Biel/Bienne&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Neuch%C3%A2tel%20railway%20station\"&gt;Neuch\u00e2tel&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Lausanne%20railway%20station\"&gt;Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Geneva%20Airport%20railway%20station\"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; can be reached.\nTrinational regional trains.\nAs a border station, Basel SBB is also aligned with regional services to Germany, France, and Switzerland. The &lt;a href=\"Basel%20Regional%20S-Bahn\"&gt;Basel Regional S-Bahn&lt;/a&gt; network ranges from Frick/Laufenburg in the east, Olten in the south, and Porrentruy in the west to Mulhouse in the north west and &lt;a href=\"Zell%20im%20Wiesental\"&gt;Zell im Wiesental&lt;/a&gt; in the north east.\nServices.\n the following services stop at Basel SBB:\nIn popular culture.\nThe station entrance and a platform is seen in the film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cassandra%20Crossing\"&gt;The Cassandra Crossing&lt;/a&gt;\" (1976) which passes as the \"&lt;a href=\"Geneva%20railway%20station\"&gt;Geneva railway station&lt;/a&gt;\"."
