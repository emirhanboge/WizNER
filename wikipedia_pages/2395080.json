    "text": "Tele2 Netherlands (formerly \"Versatel Telecom International N.V\") is a brand name of telecommunications company &lt;a href=\"T-Mobile%20Netherlands\"&gt;T-Mobile Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, operating on the Dutch and Belgian market. It sells fixed telephony, mobile telephony, broadband internet and digital TV products.\nHistory.\nTele2 was founded as a European company in 1993 to offer telecom services to both domestic and business customers. In 1997, Tele2 Netherlands introduced telecoms services to the Dutch market operating as an &lt;a href=\"MVNO\"&gt;MVNO&lt;/a&gt; and competed with lower prices for mobile services. Tele2 Netherlands was launched in 1997 and was the first Dutch company to provide IP-VPN network services.\nIn July 2005, the Dutch portion of Versatel was sold to &lt;a href=\"TELE2\"&gt;Tele2&lt;/a&gt; for 1.1 &lt;a href=\"1%2C000%2C000%2C000\"&gt;billion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;. The European commission concluded that both Tele2 and Versatel lacked the marked power to foreclose competition and allowed the sale to close. The German part, Versatel Deutschland (now &lt;a href=\"1%26amp%3B1%20Versatel\"&gt;1&amp;1 Versatel&lt;/a&gt; GmbH), was sold to &lt;a href=\"Apax%20Partners\"&gt;Apax Partners&lt;/a&gt; who merged it with &lt;a href=\"Tropolys\"&gt;Tropolys&lt;/a&gt;, another German telecommunications company. In 2006, the name \"Versatel\" was replaced by \"Tele2\".\nIn 2009, Tele2 had nearly 400,000 subscribers.\nIn 2013, Tele2 had a market share in the Netherlands of 7%.\nAcquisition by T-Mobile Netherlands.\nIn December 2017, &lt;a href=\"T-Mobile%20Netherlands\"&gt;T-Mobile Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; announced its intent to buy Tele2 Netherlands from its Swedish parent &lt;a href=\"Tele2\"&gt;Tele2 AB&lt;/a&gt;. After a delay because of a European Commission investigation, the merger was completed in January 2019. As part of the purchase, Tele2 AB acquired a 25% share in T-Mobile Netherlands.\nOn 7 January 2020, the legal entity Tele2 Netherlands Holding B.V. was merged into T-Mobile Netherlands, leaving Tele2 as a brand name of T-Mobile."
