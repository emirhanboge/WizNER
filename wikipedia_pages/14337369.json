    "text": "Noksapyeong Station is a subway station on the &lt;a href=\"Seoul%20Subway%20Line%206\"&gt;Seoul Subway Line 6&lt;/a&gt;. It is located on the eastern end of the &lt;a href=\"Yongsan%20Garrison\"&gt;Yongsan Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, and the western end of &lt;a href=\"Itaewon\"&gt;Itaewon&lt;/a&gt;. It is the main station servicing the &lt;a href=\"Haebangchon\"&gt;Haebangchon&lt;/a&gt; and Hoenamu-gil communities, which are known for having significant foreign populations.\nThis station has low ridership due to its location, but is noted for its impressive interior design. It has five underground levels, and a glass &lt;a href=\"dome\"&gt;dome&lt;/a&gt; on top of the building lets in &lt;a href=\"sunlight\"&gt;sunlight&lt;/a&gt; which permeates throughout the station. In addition to being featured in Korean movies and dramas, &lt;a href=\"weddings\"&gt;weddings&lt;/a&gt; could be held there at no cost for a few years after opening. The &lt;a href=\"embassy\"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; in South Korea is close to this station. &lt;a href=\"Namsan%20%28Seoul%29\"&gt;Namsan&lt;/a&gt; lies just to the north, a 20-minute walk from the station."
