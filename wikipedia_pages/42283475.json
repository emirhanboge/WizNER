    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"First%20Lok%20Sabha\"&gt;First Lok Sabha&lt;/a&gt; was constituted on 17 April 1952 after &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"1951%20Indian%20general%20election\"&gt;first general election&lt;/a&gt;. It completed its full tenure of five years and was dissolved on 4 April 1957. The year 1951 is often misleadingly associated with the election for first Lok Sabha. That is because polling for 3-4 constituencies was held in late 1951 before snow would cover that region. Polling for rest of the seats (97-98%) was conducted in December 1951 and January 1952, a few seats voted in February 1952, and Lok Sabha was constituted in April 1952. Ninety constituencies elected two members each, a practice that some constituencies followed even in 1957.\nThe official list of members, hosted on a site maintained by Government of India : http://www.elections.in/parliamentary-constituencies/1951-election-results.html"
