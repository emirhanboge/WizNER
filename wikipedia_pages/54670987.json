    "text": "\u010cuma or kuga () is the &lt;a href=\"personification\"&gt;personification&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"plague%20%28disease%29\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20mythology\"&gt;Serbian mythology&lt;/a&gt;. It was imagined as an old (rarely, as young) &lt;a href=\"woman\"&gt;woman&lt;/a&gt; dressed in &lt;a href=\"white\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;. Mentioning \u010duma was avoided, so &lt;a href=\"euphemism\"&gt;euphemism&lt;/a&gt;s \"kuma\" (godmother) or \"teta\" (aunty) () were used.\n\u010cumas were believed to live in a far away land, from where they set out to infect people. They hate &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;iness and are especially eager to infect a dirty house, hence if plague would appear in the vicinity, it was believed that every house and its occupants must be thoroughly cleaned; which was a useful belief that actually helps with real plague. &lt;a href=\"Sacrifice\"&gt;Offerings&lt;/a&gt; of food, clean water, &lt;a href=\"basil\"&gt;basil&lt;/a&gt; and a comb could also be made to her."
