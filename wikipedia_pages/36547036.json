Prior to that, he was commander of the I Marine Expeditionary Force at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Pendleton%2C%20California\"&gt;Camp Pendleton, California&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\nGurganus graduated from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;University of North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and was commissioned in May 1976. After the basic school, he served as a Rifle Platoon Commander and Company Executive Officer in 2d Battalion, 1st Marines (1977\u201379).\nMilitary career.\nGurganus commanded Special Purpose MAGTF-8 in Haiti and the Regimental Combat Team 8 in &lt;a href=\"Al%20Anbar%20Governorate\"&gt;Anbar Province, Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in various capacities from 2005 to 2008.\nFrom 2010 to 2011, he was commander, US Marine Corps Forces &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt; and U/C/J-5 (Strategy) of United Nations Command/Combined Forces Command/United States Forces Korea (2009\u201311) at &lt;a href=\"Yongsan%20Garrison\"&gt;Yongsan Garrison&lt;/a&gt; in Seoul.\nHis medals include the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Superior%20Service%20Medal\"&gt;Defense Superior Service Medal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Legions%20of%20Merit\"&gt;Legions of Merit&lt;/a&gt; with V device, and a gold star (in lieu of a second award).\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"September%202012%20Camp%20Bastion%20raid\"&gt;September 2012 Camp Bastion Raid&lt;/a&gt;, Gurganus and other members of the base's military leadership came under investigation for negligence. Some guard towers at the base were manned by dummies. Two US service members, LtCol &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Raible\"&gt;Christopher Raible&lt;/a&gt; and Sgt Bradley Atwell, were killed by enemy rocket fire in the attack. Raible was the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Harrier%20Jump%20Jet\"&gt;Harrier squadron&lt;/a&gt; attached to the base. The entire Harrier squadron was destroyed or rendered combat ineffective as a result of the raid, making the attack the largest hit on US air-power since the Vietnam War.\nOn September 30, 2013, Gurganus was asked to retire, along with the Marine major general who commanded the aviation arm at Camp Bastion, &lt;a href=\"Gregg%20A.%20Sturdevant\"&gt;Gregg A. Sturdevant&lt;/a&gt; (whom the commandant recommended receiving a Letter of Censure by the Secretary of the Navy), and both complied. They were both honorably discharged and received full pay, pension, and benefits. Before the investigation, Gurganus had been nominated for a third star as Marine Corps Chief of Staff at the Pentagon; the appointment and the possibility of promotion to &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20general\"&gt;lieutenant general&lt;/a&gt; have now been rescinded.\nOther assignments.\nOther operational assignments included assistant operations officer, rifle company commander, and weapons company commander with &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Battalion%2C%206th%20Marines\"&gt;3rd Battalion, 6th Marines&lt;/a&gt; (1984\u201387); commanding officer, &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Battalion%2C%206th%20Marines\"&gt;3rd Battalion, 6th Marines&lt;/a&gt; and G-7, &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Marine%20Division\"&gt;2nd Marine Division&lt;/a&gt; (1995\u201397); G-3 current operations officer, &lt;a href=\"III%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;III Marine Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; (2001\u201302); deputy commander, 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (2002\u201303); commanding officer, &lt;a href=\"8th%20Marine%20Regiment\"&gt;8th Marine Regiment&lt;/a&gt; (2003\u201305); commanding officer, Regimental Combat Team 8 (March 2005 \u2013 August 2005) in &lt;a href=\"Al%20Anbar%20Province\"&gt;Al Anbar Province&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;; operations officer, 2nd Marine Division; assistant division commander, 2nd Marine Division (2006\u201308).\nSupporting establishment duties included executive officer and commanding officer, Marine Detachment, (1979\u201381); aide-de-camp to CG, MCB, &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Lejeune\"&gt;Camp Lejeune&lt;/a&gt; (1981\u201382); company commander at the Infantry Training School (1982\u201383); depot training officer, OIC of the Field Training Unit, and operations officer of support battalion at Marine Corps Recruit Depot, &lt;a href=\"Parris%20Island%2C%20S.C.\"&gt;Parris Island, S.C.&lt;/a&gt; (1987\u201390); OCS company commander (1990); and MAGTF staff training program instructor (1992\u201395).
