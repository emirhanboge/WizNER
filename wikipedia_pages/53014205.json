    "text": "SMIM23 or Small Integral Membrane Protein 23 is a &lt;a href=\"protein\"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; which in humans is encoded by the SMIM23 or c5orf50 gene. The longer &lt;a href=\"mRNA\"&gt;mRNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"isoform\"&gt;isoform&lt;/a&gt; is 519 &lt;a href=\"nucleotide\"&gt;nucleotide&lt;/a&gt;s which translates to 172 &lt;a href=\"amino%20acid\"&gt;amino acid&lt;/a&gt;s of a protein. In recent advancements, researchers have identified this gene, along with a few others, could potentially play a role in how facial morphology arises in humans. Though this research is still relatively new it provides the start of a path for further research on this gene.\nGene.\nSMIM23 is a protein-encoding gene. Basic information about its aliases and chromosome location are given in the table. The schematic of the chromosome helps to visualize the location of the gene.\nmRNA.\nWhile the gene has two &lt;a href=\"splice%20isoform\"&gt;splice isoform&lt;/a&gt;s (isoforms X1 and X2), it has three exon/exon boundaries indicating four &lt;a href=\"exon\"&gt;exon&lt;/a&gt;s (nucleotide 1-105, 106-157, 158-225, and 226-519). \nProtein.\nPhysical features.\nSMIM23 notably has a &lt;a href=\"transmembrane%20domain\"&gt;transmembrane domain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe predicted &lt;a href=\"isoelectric%20point\"&gt;isoelectric point&lt;/a&gt; for the unmodified/unprocessed protein in mice is 5.779 while only the transmembrane region in humans has an isoelectric point of 5.928\nThe gene appears to be &lt;a href=\"Leucine\"&gt;Leucine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glutamic%20acid\"&gt;Glutamic Acid&lt;/a&gt; rich though not at any usually high number. It is also weak in all other amino acids besides Alanine, Serine, and Glutamine.\nThe region underlined in the conceptual translation was predicted to be an &lt;a href=\"Involucrin\"&gt;Involucrin&lt;/a&gt; repeat.\nPost-Translational modifications.\nThe transmembrane region is 1674.2 Daltons while the whole protein is 200008.51 Da. This is very similar to what was found with UniProt where predicted molecular weight was 20.025 kDa. Antibody kits were investigated to see banding pattern and weight changes that may have occurred &lt;a href=\"post%20translation\"&gt;post translation&lt;/a&gt;. C5orf50 &lt;a href=\"Polyclonal%20Antibody\"&gt;Polyclonal Antibody&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"ThermoFisher%20Scientific\"&gt;ThermoFisher Scientific&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"Western%20Blot\"&gt;Western Blot&lt;/a&gt; banding pattern at 40 kDa. This predicts that there is a significant amount of post-translational modification by addition of large components.\nThere are many &lt;a href=\"phosphorylation%20site\"&gt;phosphorylation site&lt;/a&gt;s along its sequence including two &lt;a href=\"protein%20kinase%20C\"&gt;protein kinase C&lt;/a&gt; phosphorylation sites, &lt;a href=\"cAMP-dependent%20protein%20kinase\"&gt;cAMP-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cGMP-dependent%20protein%20kinase\"&gt;cGMP-dependent protein kinase&lt;/a&gt; phosphorylation site, and a &lt;a href=\"tyrosine%20kinase\"&gt;tyrosine kinase&lt;/a&gt; phosphorylation site. There is also a confident potential C-terminal GPI-Modification Site.\nSecondary structure.\nThere are two stretches of &lt;a href=\"alpha%20helix\"&gt;alpha helices&lt;/a&gt; from amino acid 33 to 49 and 89 to 136 based on evidence from various programs that predict &lt;a href=\"secondary%20structure\"&gt;secondary structure&lt;/a&gt;. The most informative of all the programs from the ones investigated is PELE on Biology Workbench.\nA &lt;a href=\"Protein%20tertiary%20structure\"&gt;3D protein structure&lt;/a&gt; was predicted to look like a series of helices, similar to what was predicted by other programs.\nSubcellular localization.\nThis human integral membrane protein is predicted to be found in the &lt;a href=\"endoplasmic%20reticulum\"&gt;endoplasmic reticulum&lt;/a&gt;. The same kind of investigation of protein localization in other types of species returned conflicting results. Many programs predicted the protein to be present in the cytosol. This suggests the possibility of incorrect naming, i.e. the protein may not be integral membrane due to other predicted locations. This type of conclusion will require further information.\nExpression.\nNot enough consensus exists as to where in the body SMIM23 is expressed. Databases indicate mainly in the &lt;a href=\"testes\"&gt;testes&lt;/a&gt;, but this may be due to the lack of data.\nRegulation of Expression.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Promoter%20%28genetics%29\"&gt;promoter&lt;/a&gt; region of SMIM23 is approximately 1192 nucleotides long with various predicted &lt;a href=\"transcription%20factor\"&gt;transcription factor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRegulation in the secondary structure is a predicted &lt;a href=\"stem-loop\"&gt;stem-loop&lt;/a&gt; in the 5' &lt;a href=\"Untranslated%20region\"&gt;UTR&lt;/a&gt; region with a few areas of conservation across species.\nFunction and clinical significance.\nNovel research has suggested that how face shape arises in individuals may be influenced by a set of genes. This set includes SMIM23. Though in the paper the gene is referred to by an alias (C5orf50), it is clear that the scientists have gathered a list of five genes that likely determine facial shape. This is specifically people of European descent. These findings are supported by replicating phenotypes of each specific gene and statistical analysis. Just like findings elsewhere, the article mentions SMIM23 that likely codes for an unknown transmembrane protein. There have also been studies where a set of genes including SMIM23 may influence &lt;a href=\"human%20height\"&gt;human height&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, a great deal of research is being done on &lt;a href=\"chromosome%205\"&gt;chromosome 5&lt;/a&gt; in general to understand roles of certain genes on it including SMIM23. This could one day provide insight into this gene\u2019s specific roles on the chromosome itself.\nInteracting proteins.\nThe following proteins are predicted to interact with SMIM23.\nCilia And Flagella Associated Protein 43 also known as CFAP43 or WDR96 is the most confident of the predicted functional partners and is a tryptophan-aspartic acid repeat domain.\nSFR1 is SWI5-dependent recombination repair 1 which is a component of the &lt;a href=\"SWI5-SFR1%20complex\"&gt;SWI5-SFR1 complex&lt;/a&gt;, a complex required for double-strand break repair via homologous recombination.\n&lt;a href=\"COL17A1\"&gt;COL17A1&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"collagen\"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically type XVII, alpha 1. This may play a role in overall protein structure.\n&lt;a href=\"PRDM16\"&gt;PRDM16&lt;/a&gt; binds to DNA and acts as a &lt;a href=\"transcriptional%20regulator\"&gt;transcriptional regulator&lt;/a&gt;. It functions in the differentiation between white and &lt;a href=\"brown%20fat\"&gt;brown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adipose%20tissue\"&gt;adipose tissue&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be a repressor of &lt;a href=\"transforming%20growth%20factor-beta%20signaling\"&gt;transforming growth factor-beta signaling&lt;/a&gt;.\nHomology and evolution.\nThere are no known &lt;a href=\"paralog\"&gt;paralog&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere are around 100+ known &lt;a href=\"ortholog\"&gt;ortholog&lt;/a&gt;s which range from primates to small ground animals. From these investigations and that of sequence similarity, an ortholog space can be discussed. The closest relatives to humans with the SMIM23 gene were in primates so two types of monkeys were picked which diverged around 29.4 million years ago and had sequence similarities in the high 70s. Slightly more distant relatives with the gene come from a wide variety of animals from horses, to sea mammals, to bats, and more which all have similarities between 62-69%. Lastly, some distantly related orthologs were included like the &lt;a href=\"Tasmanian%20devil\"&gt;Tasmanian devil&lt;/a&gt; and various scavenger animals which have similarities between 40-61%.\nIt is interesting to see how some portions are still highly conserved (see conceptual translation above). The most interesting motif is &lt;a href=\"tryptophan\"&gt;tryptophan&lt;/a&gt; 124, &lt;a href=\"leucine\"&gt;leucine&lt;/a&gt; 125, and &lt;a href=\"aspartic%20acid\"&gt;aspartic acid&lt;/a&gt; 126. Lastly, in &lt;a href=\"BLAST\"&gt;BLAST&lt;/a&gt; a protein family of unknown function was returned. There are two small conserved sequences part of the DUF4635 motif (LEQ and DLE). So though not completely conserved in the alignments done with SMIM23, these were labeled in the conceptual translation.\nOrthologs.\nThe protein was not found in bacteria, &lt;a href=\"archaea\"&gt;archaea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"protist\"&gt;protist&lt;/a&gt;s, plants, fungi, invertebrate, reptiles, and birds. All the found orthologs were under mammals. An unrooted phylogenetic tree of SMIM23 was created with a few close, moderately related, and distant orthologs (listed in table). Here, larger the distance (length of line), longer the time to last common ancestor. Sequence identity refers to similar amino acids while similarity refers to amino acid match. "
