    "text": "The Anker Site (11Ck-21) is located on the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Calumet%20River\"&gt;Little Calumet River&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Chicago%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Chicago, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. It is classified as a late &lt;a href=\"Prehistory\"&gt;Prehistoric&lt;/a&gt; site with &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mississippian\"&gt;Upper Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; Huber (aka Blue Island) affiliation.\nHistory of Archaeological Investigations.\nIn 1958 prehistoric remains were uncovered during construction of a subdivision in suburban &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. A salvage operation was undertaken under the auspices of the &lt;a href=\"Illinois%20Archaeological%20Survey\"&gt;Illinois Archaeological Survey&lt;/a&gt;, along with several individuals who excavated some of the burials and features on their own and shared their findings with the Survey.\nResults of Data Analysis.\nExcavations at the site yielded &lt;a href=\"Prehistory\"&gt;Prehistoric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, a house structure, &lt;a href=\"Feature%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;pit features&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"burial\"&gt;burial&lt;/a&gt;s and animal bone. The site consisted of two parts: the village area and a &lt;a href=\"cemetery\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt; containing burials with rich &lt;a href=\"grave%20goods\"&gt;grave goods&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nA structure was defined by the presence of post molds and other features. It was 55 feet long by 13 feet wide and oval in shape. There were 3 fireplaces along the center line and 7 refuse/cache pits inside and 2 outside the structure. Charcoal in some of the post molds implies that the structure was burned.\nEight structures located at the nearby &lt;a href=\"Oak%20Forest%20Site\"&gt;Oak Forest site&lt;/a&gt; ranged from 25 to 47.5 feet long. The Anker structure is significantly larger. &lt;a href=\"Ceremony\"&gt;Ceremonial&lt;/a&gt; structures were known to be longer than residential structures in &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; society, and therefore the Anker structure may have been ceremonial-related or religious in nature. A &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; skull was placed in one of the &lt;a href=\"fire%20pit\"&gt;fire pit&lt;/a&gt;s of this structure, which also indicates it may be ceremonial in nature.\nIn the village area, 4 fire pits and 17 trash pits were noted. One of the trash pits included 3 reconstructable &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Mississippian\"&gt;Middle Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pottery\"&gt;pottery&lt;/a&gt; vessels, which are extremely rare in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20area\"&gt;Great Lakes area&lt;/a&gt;.\nBurials.\nTwo types of &lt;a href=\"burials\"&gt;burials&lt;/a&gt; were noted: 9 bundle burials with few &lt;a href=\"grave%20goods\"&gt;grave goods&lt;/a&gt;, and 31 extended burials, many of which contained a rich assortment of grave goods. Many of the grave goods are described below and include &lt;a href=\"Pipe%20smoking\"&gt;pipes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pottery\"&gt;pottery&lt;/a&gt; vessels and animal bones/skulls that may have been components of &lt;a href=\"medicine%20bundle\"&gt;medicine bundle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAnimal Remains.\nRemains from several species were recovered from the site. The main species present were &lt;a href=\"deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"bowfin\"&gt;bowfin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"catfish\"&gt;catfish&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"painted%20turtle\"&gt;painted turtle&lt;/a&gt;); also present were &lt;a href=\"beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"raccoon\"&gt;raccoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;, unidentifiable &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; bone fragments and fresh water &lt;a href=\"mussel\"&gt;mussel&lt;/a&gt;s (especially Amblema costata). These remains were not modified into tools like the bone tools described in the Artifacts section below, and may be considered food remains or, in the case of the dog, the remains of &lt;a href=\"Ceremony\"&gt;ceremonial&lt;/a&gt; activities. Dog sacrifice and dog meat consumption was observed to have ceremonial and religious implications in early &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; tribes.\nArtifacts.\n&lt;a href=\"Artifact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; recovered from the site included:\nThe non-pottery artifacts found at an archaeological site can provide useful cultural context as well as a glimpse into the &lt;a href=\"Home\"&gt;domestic&lt;/a&gt; tasks performed at a site; &lt;a href=\"Ceremony\"&gt;ceremonial&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Religion\"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt; activities; &lt;a href=\"recreation\"&gt;recreation&lt;/a&gt;al activities; and &lt;a href=\"clothing\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"adornment\"&gt;personal adornment&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt Anker, the vast majority of these items were grave goods recovered from the numerous burials present at the site.\nSome of the most prominent and diagnostic non-pottery artifacts are presented here in more detail:\nUpper Mississippian Huber (aka Blue Island) Pottery.\nArchaeologists often find pottery to be a very useful tool in analyzing a prehistoric culture. It is usually very plentiful at a site and the details of manufacture and decoration are very sensitive indicators of time, space and culture.\nMost of the pottery conforms to the Huber Ware classification which is characteristic of the &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; area in the late &lt;a href=\"Prehistory\"&gt;Prehistoric&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Protohistory\"&gt;Protohistoric&lt;/a&gt;/early &lt;a href=\"Historical%20archaeology\"&gt;Historic&lt;/a&gt; periods (approx. A.D. 1400-1680s). Although the Huber tradition was well known by archaeologists for decades following the original excavations at the &lt;a href=\"Huber%20Site\"&gt;Huber site&lt;/a&gt;, a formalized &lt;a href=\"Typology%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;typology&lt;/a&gt; was not developed until Charles Faulkner devised one in his 1972 report on the &lt;a href=\"Griesmer%20Site\"&gt;Griesmer site&lt;/a&gt; in northwestern &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, just to the east of &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuber pottery is characterized by shell-&lt;a href=\"Temper%20%28pottery%29\"&gt;tempered&lt;/a&gt;, plain surface pottery with globular vessel shape and restricted orifices with everted rims. Some vessels also have strap handles. Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from just below the lip to the shoulder. Rarely, surfaces are &lt;a href=\"Cord-marked%20pottery\"&gt;cordmarked&lt;/a&gt; or smoothed over cordmarked. The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching. A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.\nThe 1958 excavations recovered 823 sherds, almost all of it Huber ware. Surfaces were primarily plain and decorated with medium- to wide-trailed lines on the shoulder area. Most of the lips were notched. Rarely, punctates accompanied the incised lines.\nHowever, some of the whole or reconstructible pots recovered were obviously trade ware from outside the &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; area. These vessels were characteristic of types found on the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Arkansas\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; area:\nFollowing Faulkner's &lt;a href=\"Typology%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;typology&lt;/a&gt;, this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:\nChronology of Anker pottery within the Huber (aka Blue Island) sequence.\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age. Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have &lt;a href=\"Cord-marked%20pottery\"&gt;cordmarked&lt;/a&gt; surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Early Huber sites have also been observed to have significant amounts of Fisher Ware as well. Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.\nIn the Anker site assemblage, 12% of sherds are cordmarked (more than any other Huber site except &lt;a href=\"Hoxie%20Farm%20Site\"&gt;Hoxie Farm&lt;/a&gt;), and 59% of decorated sherds have wide-line decoration. Also, 74% of the lips are notched, and there is a small presence of Fisher Ware in the assemblage. This combination of traits indicates a relatively early time placement for Anker within the Huber sequence. The researchers who excavated the site estimated the range of occupation to be approximately A.D. 1400\u20131500.\nHuber (aka Blue Island) within the Upper Mississippian Culture.\nHuber ware (and Huber culture) are often mentioned together with Fisher. Both Fisher and Huber are &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mississippian\"&gt;Upper Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; cultures which existed in the southern &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Michigan\"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt; region in the states of northern &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; and southwest &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. Both have shell-&lt;a href=\"Temper%20%28pottery%29\"&gt;tempered&lt;/a&gt; pottery but Huber is predominantly plain surface with fine-line decoration and Fisher is predominantly &lt;a href=\"Cord-marked%20pottery\"&gt;cordmarked&lt;/a&gt; surface with wide-line decoration.\nThe relationship of Huber and Fisher both with each other and with other &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mississippian\"&gt;Upper Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; cultures in the area has long been a matter of debate and speculation among archaeologists. James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations at the Huber site, felt that Huber was a Component of the &lt;a href=\"Oneota\"&gt;Oneota&lt;/a&gt; Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus. Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the one that survived to the Historic period, based on the association of Huber pottery with early Historic European trade goods at several sites.\nNevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time. &lt;a href=\"Hoxie%20Farm%20Site\"&gt;Hoxie Farm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Griesmer%20Site\"&gt;Griesmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moccasin%20Bluff%20Site\"&gt;Moccasin Bluff&lt;/a&gt; are examples of this.\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the &lt;a href=\"Oneota\"&gt;Oneota&lt;/a&gt; tradition. The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like &lt;a href=\"Fifield%20Site\"&gt;Fifield&lt;/a&gt;, where Fisher pottery is associated with late &lt;a href=\"Prehistory\"&gt;Prehistoric&lt;/a&gt; artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the &lt;a href=\"Protohistoric\"&gt;Protohistoric&lt;/a&gt; or early &lt;a href=\"Historical%20archaeology\"&gt;Historic&lt;/a&gt; period.\nThe Anker site is unique among Huber sites in the amount of trade goods and ceremonial/religious items present. The site may have been a ceremonial or trade center; or there may have been a migration of peoples coming from the lower portion of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt; to interact with the Huber Culture population and perhaps settle in the area.\nSignificance.\nThe Anker site is a site belonging to the Huber tradition (aka Blue Island) and is considered to be closely related to the &lt;a href=\"Oneota\"&gt;Oneota&lt;/a&gt; Orr Focus. The site is unique among Huber sites in the large amount of trade goods, mostly from the lower &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt; area but also from northern &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Iroquois\"&gt;Iroquoian&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State\"&gt;New York State&lt;/a&gt;. This could mean either extensive trade networks or movements of people.\nThe structure present at Anker is larger than other Huber period houses noted at the &lt;a href=\"Oak%20Forest%20Site\"&gt;Oak Forest site&lt;/a&gt; and therefore may be a &lt;a href=\"Ceremony\"&gt;ceremonial&lt;/a&gt; structure. The fact that a &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; skull was placed in one of the pits supports that possibility. Also, many of the &lt;a href=\"grave%20goods\"&gt;grave goods&lt;/a&gt; may be interpreted as parts of &lt;a href=\"medicine%20bundle\"&gt;medicine bundle&lt;/a&gt;s or otherwise have spiritual or religious implications. The presence of the &lt;a href=\"gorget\"&gt;gorget&lt;/a&gt; with \"weeping eye\" motif and the trade vessels from the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Mississippian%20Culture\"&gt;Middle Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; area suggest that the Anker residents participated in or at least had knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Ceremonial%20Complex\"&gt;Southeastern Ceremonial Complex&lt;/a&gt;.\nBased on the animal bone found at the site, and the presence of scapula hoes, it is thought that the site was occupied at least during the summer months. It may have functioned as a religious/ceremonial center in the settlement pattern of the Huber culture, while other sites such as &lt;a href=\"Oak%20Forest%20Site\"&gt;Oak Forest&lt;/a&gt; served as semi-permanent residential areas.\nThere are no radiocarbon dates available for the site, but based on the artifacts present, the researchers believe the site was occupied from approximately A.D. 1400 to 1500. The specific &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; tribe represented by the remains is unknown; however, &lt;a href=\"Miami%20people\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois%20tribe\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; or a Chewere &lt;a href=\"Sioux\"&gt;Sioux&lt;/a&gt; group are possibilities."
