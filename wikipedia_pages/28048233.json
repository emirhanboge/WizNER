    "text": "The Granite Wash Mountains are a short, arid, low elevation mountain range of western-central &lt;a href=\"Arizona\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, in the southeast of &lt;a href=\"La%20Paz%20County%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;La Paz County&lt;/a&gt;. The range borders a slightly larger range southeast, the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Harquahala%20Mountains\"&gt;Little Harquahala Mountains&lt;/a&gt;; both ranges form a section on the same &lt;a href=\"water%20divide\"&gt;water divide&lt;/a&gt; between two desert &lt;a href=\"arroyo%20%28creek%29\"&gt;wash&lt;/a&gt;es. The washes flow in opposite directions, one northwest to the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20River\"&gt;Colorado River&lt;/a&gt;, the other southeast to the &lt;a href=\"Gila%20River\"&gt;Gila River&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe range is northwest-by-southeast trending and is in a region of about thirty landforms, plains, valleys, and mountain ranges, called the &lt;a href=\"Maria%20fold%20and%20thrust%20belt\"&gt;Maria fold and thrust belt&lt;/a&gt;. The region is in the &lt;a href=\"Basin%20and%20Range%20Province\"&gt;Basin and Range&lt;/a&gt; and three mountain ranges are in a parallel, northwest-by-southeast trending &lt;a href=\"thrust%20fault\"&gt;thrust&lt;/a&gt; belt, with two intervening valleys. The Granite Wash Mountains are attached to the southwest end of the &lt;a href=\"Harcuvar%20Mountains\"&gt;Harcuvar Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the center range of the 3 basin and range-thrusted mountains.\nThe Granite Wash range is on the same water divide as the Little Harquahala's and at the southwest end of the &lt;a href=\"McMullen%20Valley\"&gt;McMullen Valley&lt;/a&gt;; to the east, the range and water divide forces the upland drainage areas of the &lt;a href=\"Centennial%20Wash%20%28Maricopa%20County%29\"&gt;Centennial Wash&lt;/a&gt; to turn from southwest- to southeast-flowing towards the &lt;a href=\"Gila%20River\"&gt;Gila River&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Gila%20Bend%20Mountains\"&gt;Gila Bend Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. To the west of the Granite Wash Mountains, the &lt;a href=\"Bouse%20Wash\"&gt;Bouse Wash&lt;/a&gt; flows northwest to the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20River\"&gt;Colorado River&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Colorado%20River%20Valley\"&gt;Lower Colorado River Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaria fold and thrust belt.\nThe three mountain ranges and two valleys bordered to the northeast:\nPeaks, and landforms.\nThe highest elevation in the mountains is Salome Peak at , in the range's center. Salome Peak is located at .\n&lt;a href=\"Granite%20Wash%20Pass\"&gt;Granite Wash Pass&lt;/a&gt; is located at the northwest end of the southern mountain pair, the Little Harquahala's; &lt;a href=\"Hope%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; is west and &lt;a href=\"Harcuvar%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Harcuvar, Arizona&lt;/a&gt; is east. The pass contains the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20and%20California%20Railroad\"&gt;Arizona and California Railroad&lt;/a&gt; line, as well as &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2060%20in%20Arizona\"&gt;U.S. Route 60 in Arizona&lt;/a&gt; form &lt;a href=\"Brenda%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Brenda&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2010%20in%20Arizona\"&gt;Interstate 10 in Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, and the route northeast to &lt;a href=\"Aguila%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Aguila&lt;/a&gt;, then to &lt;a href=\"Wickenburg%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Wickenburg&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2093%20in%20Arizona\"&gt;U.S. 93&lt;/a&gt;.\nBouse Wash, Centennial Wash.\nThe Granite Wash and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Harquahala%20Mountains\"&gt;Little Harquahala Mountains&lt;/a&gt; are on the northwest by southeast &lt;a href=\"water%20divide\"&gt;water divide&lt;/a&gt; between two &lt;a href=\"arroyo%20%28creek%29\"&gt;wash&lt;/a&gt;es. The &lt;a href=\"Bouse%20Wash\"&gt;Bouse Wash&lt;/a&gt; flows northwest to the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20River\"&gt;Colorado River&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Centennial%20Wash%20%28Maricopa%20County%29\"&gt;Centennial Wash (Maricopa County)&lt;/a&gt; is east and flows southeast to meet the &lt;a href=\"Gila%20River\"&gt;Gila River&lt;/a&gt; at the great Gila Bend, adjacent the &lt;a href=\"Gila%20Bend%20Mountains\"&gt;Gila Bend Mountains&lt;/a&gt;."
