    "text": "The Godahl Store is a historic &lt;a href=\"consumers%27%20co-operative\"&gt;consumers' co-operative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"general%20store\"&gt;general store&lt;/a&gt; established in the unincorporated community of &lt;a href=\"Godahl%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Godahl&lt;/a&gt; in 1894. It was listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; as the Nelson and Albin Cooperative Mercantile Association Store in 1987 for its local significance to commerce. The store was in business through 2016.\nDescription.\nThe Godahl Store's original wing is two stories with a &lt;a href=\"false%20front\"&gt;false front&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gable\"&gt;gable&lt;/a&gt; roof. A one-story addition wraps around the rear and north side of the store. Both portions are wood &lt;a href=\"framing%20%28construction%29\"&gt;frame&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"clapboard%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;clapboard&lt;/a&gt; siding. A one-story, wood-frame warehouse stands behind the store.\nHistory.\nThe Godahl Store originated in a rural farming district on the border of &lt;a href=\"Watonwan%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Watonwan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brown%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Brown County&lt;/a&gt;, an area settled by Scandinavian immigrants in the 1870s. Isolated from the nearest towns by a full day's wagon journey, the local residents had limited access to distribute their agricultural products or purchase manufactured goods. They first collaborated on a &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt; enterprise in 1891, establishing a &lt;a href=\"creamery\"&gt;creamery&lt;/a&gt; at the crossroads community of Godahl. This proved successful, so three years later a public meeting was held to propose a cooperative commercial venture as well. Taking its name from &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20Township%2C%20Watonwan%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Albin%20Township%2C%20Brown%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Albin Townships&lt;/a&gt; that Godahl straddled, the Nelson and Albin Cooperative Mercantile Association was formally established on April 20, 1894. With bylaws written in &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20language\"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; and shares available at $20, the association contracted with ten men to construct a store opposite the Godahl creamery.\nThe Godahl Store was completed in August 1894 and stocked groceries, &lt;a href=\"dry%20goods\"&gt;dry goods&lt;/a&gt;, and tools. It bought local produce and resold goods acquired in &lt;a href=\"St.%20James%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;St. James&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"La%20Salle%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;La Salle&lt;/a&gt;. In 1895 a warehouse was added to store hardware like nails and fencing, and the following year the main building was expanded with an addition wrapping around the north side and rear.\nThe Godahl Store became the nucleus of the dispersed community. It served as the local &lt;a href=\"post%20office\"&gt;post office&lt;/a&gt; and became a central gathering place for meetings and social events. In 1905 the store installed one of the first &lt;a href=\"telephone\"&gt;telephone&lt;/a&gt;s in the area, and later housed a branch of the Watonwan County Library.\nThe exterior was modified in 1916. The building's false-front fa\u00e7ade and small south addition were likely added at this time. The creamery failed in 1956 as &lt;a href=\"dairy%20farming\"&gt;dairy farming&lt;/a&gt; subsided in the area, so the mercantile bought the building as a warehouse for feed, seed, and fertilizer."
