    "text": "A Personal Car Communicator (PCC) is a system of protection in a &lt;a href=\"key%20fob\"&gt;key fob&lt;/a&gt; developed by &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20Cars\"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Personal Car Communicator was first introduced by the company in the new &lt;a href=\"Volvo%20S80\"&gt;S80&lt;/a&gt; sedan for model year 2007. The personal car communicator uses a two-way radio communicator, allowing the vehicle owner to check such security items as the locking status of the vehicle. Most notable is the ability of a heart beat monitor that checks if someone is left inside the car."
