    "text": "Selanikli Mehmed N\u00e2z\u0131m &lt;a href=\"Bey\"&gt;Bey&lt;/a&gt; also known as Doktor Nazim (1870\u20131926) was a &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20people\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; physician, politician, and theorist. He played a significant role in the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20genocide\"&gt;Armenian genocide&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20genocide\"&gt;expulsion of Greeks&lt;/a&gt; in Western Anatolia. He was convicted of the attempted assassination of &lt;a href=\"Atat%C3%BCrk\"&gt;Atat\u00fcrk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"%C4%B0zmir\"&gt;\u0130zmir&lt;/a&gt; and hanged in &lt;a href=\"Ankara\"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt; on 26 August 1926. He also served as the chairman of the Turkish sports club &lt;a href=\"Fenerbah%C3%A7e%20S.K.\"&gt;Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.&lt;/a&gt; between 1916 and 1918.\nEarly life and the Balkan wars.\nFrom a &lt;a href=\"D%C3%B6nmeh\"&gt;D\u00f6nmeh&lt;/a&gt; background, Naz\u0131m was born and raised in Salonica; his family were longtime residents of the city, successful in running various businesses, and he himself was the director of a hospital.\nNaz\u0131m had joined the &lt;a href=\"Young%20Turks\"&gt;Young Turks&lt;/a&gt; Movement, and when the &lt;a href=\"Greeks\"&gt;Greeks&lt;/a&gt; occupied Salonica in October 1912 during the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20wars\"&gt;Balkan wars&lt;/a&gt;, he was imprisoned for eleven months in an Athens prison as a &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20nationalism\"&gt;Turkish nationalist&lt;/a&gt;. The guards abused him and told him that his family had been killed, and that Constantinople was already occupied, while Anatolia would soon fall to the Greeks. Sent to &lt;a href=\"Smyrna\"&gt;Smyrna&lt;/a&gt; (Izmir) after a request by the &lt;a href=\"Committee%20of%20Union%20and%20Progress\"&gt;Committee of Union and Progress&lt;/a&gt; (CUP), he was deeply troubled by his family's fate (and that of his baby daughter) and the exile from his hometown. In newspaper articles he called attention to Bulgarian atrocities committed against Muslims and \"call[ed] for vengeance against the remaining Ottoman Christians\". The Ottoman defeat and the &lt;a href=\"ethnic%20cleansing\"&gt;ethnic cleansing&lt;/a&gt; of Muslims was traumatic for many Young Turks and led to a desire for revenge; Naz\u0131m's \"transformation from a patriotic doctor into a rabid, vindictive nationalist... symbolized the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20genocide\"&gt;fate&lt;/a&gt; of many others\".\nRole in the Armenian genocide.\nNaz\u0131m was a leading figure in the &lt;a href=\"Turkification\"&gt;Turkification&lt;/a&gt; of the Ottoman Empire. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Te%C5%9Fkil%C3%A2t-%C4%B1%20Mahsusa\"&gt;Te\u015fkil\u00e2t-\u0131 Mahsusa&lt;/a&gt; (\"Special Organization\" in the Ottoman Empire). Many members of this organization eventually participated in the Turkish national movement and had played special roles in the Armenian Genocide.\nIn a speech delivered on during the closing remarks of a Committee of Union and Progress meeting, Naz\u0131m said:\nAnd continued by saying, \"the procedure this time will be one of total annihilation-it is necessary that not even one single Armenian survive this annihilation\".\nDuring one of the secret meetings of the &lt;a href=\"Young%20Turks\"&gt;Young Turks&lt;/a&gt;, Naz\u0131m was quoted as saying, \"The massacre is necessary. All the &lt;a href=\"Millet%20system\"&gt;non-Turkish elements&lt;/a&gt;, whatever nation they belong to, should be exterminated\". In February 1915, two months prior to the commencement of the Armenian Genocide, Naz\u0131m declared a new government policy which would \"produce total annihilation\" in which would be \"essential that no &lt;a href=\"Armenians\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; survives\". He has been noted to have said that the Ottoman Empire should be \"freeing the fatherland of the aspirations of this cursed race\" when referring to the &lt;a href=\"Armenians\"&gt;Armenians&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaz\u0131m subsequently fled from the Ottoman Empire to Germany in October 1918. Due to his role in the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20genocide\"&gt;Armenian genocide&lt;/a&gt;, Naz\u0131m was sentenced to death in absentia by the Ottoman &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Courts-Martial%20of%201919%E2%80%931920\"&gt;Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919\u20131920&lt;/a&gt;, but this was never carried out due to him having fled to &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. He moved to the newly founded &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Turkey\"&gt;Republic of Turkey&lt;/a&gt; in 1922 and was never executed for his crimes against the Armenians. However, in 1926, the Ankara &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Tribunal\"&gt;Independence Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; ordered his arrest and ordered his execution for attempting to &lt;a href=\"%C4%B0zmir%20plot\"&gt;assassinate Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk&lt;/a&gt; together with other former politicians of the CUP like &lt;a href=\"Mehmet%20Cavit%20Bey\"&gt;Mehmet Cavit Bey&lt;/a&gt; or ."
