    "text": "John 'Jack' Hart Evans (9 April 1881 \u2013 9 August 1959) was a &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; international &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; centre who played club rugby for &lt;a href=\"Pontypool%20RFC\"&gt;Pontypool&lt;/a&gt;. He won three caps for &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; during 1907.\nRugby career.\nEvans came to note as a rugby player when he turned out for Pontypool Thursday, a minor town team. He soon progressed to Pontypool RFC, who were at the time making a notable appearance at club level and gaining caps internationally. In 1906, Evans was one of five Pontypool players to be selected to face &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Roos%20%28rugby%20player%29\"&gt;Paul Roos&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"1906-07%20South%20Africa%20rugby%20union%20tour\"&gt;1906 touring South African team&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Monmouthshire%20County%20RFC\"&gt;Monmouthshire&lt;/a&gt; team. Evans was partnered at centre for the Monmouthshire game with Pontypool teammate &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Jones%20%28rugby%20player%29\"&gt;Jack Jones&lt;/a&gt;, but Evans spent much of the game in defensive cover and he and Jones were deemed out of form against the much faster Springboks. The game ended in a 17-0 defeat for Monmouthshire.\nJust a few months after the South Africa game, Evans won his first international cap for Wales when he was brought in as centre for the opening game of the &lt;a href=\"1907%20Home%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;1907 Home Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt;. Partnered with &lt;a href=\"Rhys%20Gabe\"&gt;Rhys Gabe&lt;/a&gt;, Evans was given the difficult task of replacing &lt;a href=\"Gwyn%20Nicholls\"&gt;Gwyn Nicholls&lt;/a&gt; one of the most inventive and loved centres in Welsh rugby history. The 1907 campaign started well, with a convincing win over England, and the Welsh selectors responded by keeping faith with Evans for the next two games of the tournament. Wales suffered a narrow loss to Scotland, but responded with a large victory over Ireland. Despite playing in a successful Championship campaign, Evans was dropped the next season in favour of the more experienced &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Trew\"&gt;Billy Trew&lt;/a&gt;, and never represented his country again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"
