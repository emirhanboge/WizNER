    "text": "James McNeill (27 March 1869 \u2013 12 December 1938) was an &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; politician and diplomat, who served as first High Commissioner to London and second &lt;a href=\"governor-general%20of%20the%20Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;governor-general of the Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nOne of five children born to Archibald McNeill, a Roman Catholic working class \"baker, sailor and merchant\", and his wife, Rosetta (n\u00e9e McAuley) McNeill, James was the brother of &lt;a href=\"Irish%20nationalism\"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Eoin%20MacNeill\"&gt;Eoin MacNeill&lt;/a&gt;. James McNeill served as a high-ranking member of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Civil%20Service%20%28British%20India%29\"&gt;Indian Civil Service&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Calcutta\"&gt;Calcutta&lt;/a&gt;.\nPublic life.\nAlthough unconnected with the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Rising\"&gt;Easter Rising&lt;/a&gt; in 1916, McNeill was arrested and jailed by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20Castle%20administration\"&gt;Dublin Castle administration&lt;/a&gt;. On release, he was elected to &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20County%20Council\"&gt;Dublin County Council&lt;/a&gt;, becoming its chairman. He served as a member of the committee under &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Collins%20%28Irish%20leader%29\"&gt;Michael Collins&lt;/a&gt;, the chairman of the Provisional Government, that drafted the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Constitution of the Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt;. He was subsequently appointed as High Commissioner from Ireland to the United Kingdom.\nGovernor-General.\nWhen the first &lt;a href=\"Governor-General%20of%20the%20Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Governor-General of the Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Healy%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Tim Healy&lt;/a&gt; retired in December 1927, James McNeill was proposed as his replacement by the Irish government of &lt;a href=\"W.%20T.%20Cosgrave\"&gt;W. T. Cosgrave&lt;/a&gt; and duly appointed by King &lt;a href=\"George%20V\"&gt;George V&lt;/a&gt; as Governor-General of the Irish Free State.\nIn office, McNeill clashed with the King's Private Secretary when he insisted on following the constitutional advice of his Irish ministers, rather than that of the Palace, in procedures relating to the receipt of &lt;a href=\"Letter%20of%20Credence\"&gt;Letters of Credence&lt;/a&gt; accrediting ambassadors to the King in Ireland. He also refused to attend ceremonies in &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin\"&gt;Trinity College, Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, when some elements in the college tried to ensure that the old British &lt;a href=\"national%20anthem\"&gt;national anthem&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"God%20Save%20the%20Queen\"&gt;God Save the King&lt;/a&gt;\" was played, rather than the new Irish anthem, \"&lt;a href=\"Amhr%C3%A1n%20na%20bhFiann\"&gt;Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWhen &lt;a href=\"%C3%89amon%20de%20Valera\"&gt;\u00c9amon de Valera&lt;/a&gt; was nominated as &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Executive%20Council%20of%20the%20Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;President of the Executive Council&lt;/a&gt; in 1932, McNeill opted to travel to &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20House\"&gt;Leinster House&lt;/a&gt;, the parliament buildings, to appoint de Valera, rather than to require that he go to the &lt;a href=\"%C3%81ras%20an%20Uachtar%C3%A1in\"&gt;Viceregal Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, the Governor-General's residence and the former seat of British &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Lords Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, to avoid embarrassing de Valera, who was a &lt;a href=\"Irish%20republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, McNeill's tact was not reciprocated by de Valera's government, and some of its ministers sought to humiliate McNeill as the King's representative by withdrawing the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Army\"&gt;Irish Army&lt;/a&gt;'s band from playing at functions he attended and demanding he withdraw invitations to visitors to meet him. In one notorious incident in April, two ministers, &lt;a href=\"Se%C3%A1n%20T.%20O%27Kelly\"&gt;Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly&lt;/a&gt; (a future &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;President of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Aiken\"&gt;Frank Aiken&lt;/a&gt;, publicly walked out of a diplomatic function when McNeill, there as the guest of the &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; ambassador, arrived. In a fury, McNeill wrote to de Valera demanding an apology for this treatment. When none was forthcoming, apart from an ambiguous message from de Valera that could be interpreted as partially blaming McNeill for attending functions at which ministers would be present, he published his correspondence with de Valera, even though de Valera had formally advised him not to do so. De Valera then demanded that George V dismiss McNeill.\nThe King engineered a compromise, whereby de Valera withdrew his dismissal request and McNeill, who was due to retire at the end of 1932, would push forward his retirement date by a month or so. McNeill, at the King's request, resigned on 1 November 1932.\nIn June 1932 &lt;a href=\"John%20Charles%20McQuaid\"&gt;John Charles McQuaid&lt;/a&gt;, President of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20College\"&gt;Blackrock College&lt;/a&gt; hosted an extravagant garden party to welcome Papal Legate &lt;a href=\"Lorenzo%20Lauri\"&gt;Lorenzo Lauri&lt;/a&gt;, who had arrived in Ireland to represent &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20XI\"&gt;Pope Pius XI&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Eucharistic%20Congress%20of%20Dublin%20%281932%29\"&gt;31st International Eucharistic Congress&lt;/a&gt;. While De Valera maintained a very high-profile at the event, McQuaid (at de Valera's request) went to great lengths to avoid MacNeill to the extent possible.\nDeath.\nJames McNeill died in 1938 at the age of 69 in London. His widow &lt;a href=\"Josephine%20McNeill\"&gt;Josephine&lt;/a&gt; was appointed Minister to the Hague by &lt;a href=\"Se%C3%A1n%20MacBride\"&gt;Se\u00e1n MacBride&lt;/a&gt;, Minister for External Affairs in the coalition government of 1948."
