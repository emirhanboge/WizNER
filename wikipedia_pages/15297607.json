    "text": "Euchemotrema is a &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of small, air-breathing &lt;a href=\"land%20snail\"&gt;land snail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"terrestrial%20animal\"&gt;terrestrial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pulmonate\"&gt;pulmonate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gastropod\"&gt;gastropod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mollusk\"&gt;mollusk&lt;/a&gt;s in the family &lt;a href=\"Polygyridae\"&gt;Polygyridae&lt;/a&gt;.\nShell description.\nThe shell of species in this genus is usually about 8 to 11\u00a0mm in diameter (about 3/8 inch). The shells are brown with a velvety surface, similar to that of \"&lt;a href=\"Stenotrema\"&gt;Stenotrema&lt;/a&gt;\", and, in fact, this genus is sometimes combined into \"Stenotrema\". These snails typically have a less complex aperture than \"Stenotrema\": \"without a tooth within the outer arc of the lip and with no notch in the basal lip\".\nThere are also peculiarities of the male anatomy that separate the two genera.\nDistribution.\n\"Euchemotrema\" is widely distributed in eastern and central &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecies.\nThis genus includes the following species and subspecies:"
