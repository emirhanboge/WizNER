He previously played for the &lt;a href=\"Yomiuri%20Giants\"&gt;Yomiuri Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nIn , &lt;a href=\"Orix%20Buffaloes\"&gt;Orix BlueWave&lt;/a&gt; selected him with the first selection, but he did not sign, and he joined &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Gas\"&gt;Tokyo Gas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20in%20Japan%23Industrial%20baseball\"&gt;Japanese industrial leagues&lt;/a&gt; from 2000 to 2003.\nIn , &lt;a href=\"Yomiuri%20Giants\"&gt;Yomiuri Giants&lt;/a&gt; selected him and joined.\nOn December 20, 2018, he was sent to &lt;a href=\"Saitama%20Seibu%20Lions\"&gt;Saitama Seibu Lions&lt;/a&gt; as the human compensation from the earlier transferred for &lt;a href=\"Ginjiro%20Sumitani\"&gt;Ginjiro Sumitani&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nHe was selected &lt;a href=\"Japan%20national%20baseball%20team\"&gt;Japan national baseball team&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2009%20World%20Baseball%20Classic\"&gt;2009 World Baseball Classic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2013%20World%20Baseball%20Classic\"&gt;2013 World Baseball Classic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd also, in a 2008 preseason exhibition game against the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt;, Utsumi struck out 4 out of the 6 Red Sox batters he faced.\nPitching style.\nUtsumi is a \"junkball\" pitcher, meaning that he does not have overpowering pitches. His fastball is usually in the 140\u00a0km/h (87 MPH) range, and he complements it with a slurve, a changeup, and a forkball. Utsumi relies on his control to get batters out, and it is usually pretty good, but when Utsumi misses his spots, that is when trouble finds him, usually in the form of home runs."
