Lazio complained to &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; and got her banned from the national team for two years.\nOverall, Ferraguzzi was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Italy%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy women's national football team&lt;/a&gt; from 1975 until 1993, and scored Italy's first official World Cup goal in &lt;a href=\"1991%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;. She retired from international football aged 34, after playing in Italy's 1\u20130 &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Women%27s%20Euro%201993\"&gt;UEFA Women's Euro 1993&lt;/a&gt; final defeat to &lt;a href=\"Norway%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, and being named Player of the Tournament."
