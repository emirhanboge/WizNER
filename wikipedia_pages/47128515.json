However, the emotional return was not a very successful one for both the club and the Spanish manager as the &lt;a href=\"Rabat\"&gt;Rabat&lt;/a&gt;-based club was relegated to &lt;a href=\"Botola%202\"&gt;Botola 2&lt;/a&gt; as the finished in the relegation zone at the 15th position with 26 points from 4 wins and 14 draws in the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Botola\"&gt;2007\u201308 Botola&lt;/a&gt;.\nLas Norias C.F..\nIn 2008, he returned to Spain where he was appointed as the head coach of &lt;a href=\"Las%20Norias%20C.F.\"&gt;Las Norias C.F.&lt;/a&gt;\nUS T\u00e9mara.\nThe year 2009 saw the Morocco-born returning to his home country where he was appointed as the head coach of Botola 2 club, &lt;a href=\"US%20T%C3%A9mara\"&gt;US T\u00e9mara&lt;/a&gt;. He helped the club secure the 13th position with 39 points from 8 wins and 15 draws in the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20GNF%202\"&gt;2010\u201311 GNF 2&lt;/a&gt; (also known as Botola 2).\nAl-Tali'aa.\nIn 2012, he again moved out of Spain and this time to the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; and more accurately to &lt;a href=\"Oman\"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt; where he signed a one-year contract with &lt;a href=\"Oman%20Professional%20League\"&gt;Oman Elite League&lt;/a&gt; club, &lt;a href=\"Al-Tali%27aa%20SC\"&gt;Al-Tali'aa SC&lt;/a&gt; in September 2012 before the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Oman%20Elite%20League\"&gt;2012\u201313 Oman Elite League&lt;/a&gt;.\nFanja.\nIn March 2013, &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Oman%20Elite%20League\"&gt;2011\u201312 Oman Elite League&lt;/a&gt; winners, &lt;a href=\"Fanja%20SC\"&gt;Fanja SC&lt;/a&gt; appointed him as the head coach of the club for the rest of the 2012-13 season and also for the inaugural season of &lt;a href=\"Oman%20Professional%20League\"&gt;Oman Professional League&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Oman%20Professional%20League\"&gt;2013-14&lt;/a&gt;. In his very first season at the &lt;a href=\"Muscat%2C%20Oman\"&gt;Muscat&lt;/a&gt;-based club, he helped them secure the runners-up position in the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Oman%20Elite%20League\"&gt;2012\u201313 Oman Elite League&lt;/a&gt; as his side lost 3-1 against &lt;a href=\"Al-Suwaiq%20Club\"&gt;Al-Suwaiq Club&lt;/a&gt; in the Championship Play-off (both the clubs finished with 50 points at the end of the season), hence helping them to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"2014%20AFC%20Cup\"&gt;2014 AFC Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Before the beginning of the inaugural season of Oman Professional League, he and his club were very lucky as they got the services of 12 international players who had and are representing &lt;a href=\"Oman%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt; in various international competitions. His first match in-charge of the club in the 2013-14 Oman Professional League ended on a disappointing note as his side was held to a 1-1 draw by &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Oman%20Elite%20League\"&gt;2011\u201312 Oman Elite League&lt;/a&gt; runners-up, &lt;a href=\"Al-Shabab%20Club%20%28Oman%29\"&gt;Al-Shabab Club&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after the match, he was criticized by the fans for not packing his squad with senior players available in the club. Later in the second week of the league, his side hosted newly promoted side &lt;a href=\"Al-Ittihad%20Club%20%28Salalah%29\"&gt;Al-Ittihad&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Al-Seeb%20Stadium\"&gt;Al-Seeb Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and the Morocco-born coach's side well silenced the criticizers as they registered an authoritative 4-2 win over &lt;a href=\"Salalah\"&gt;Salalah&lt;/a&gt;-based club. The Morocco-born Spanish coach soon became a media star in Oman due to his impressive performances with the club, which included a 5-0 victor over &lt;a href=\"Majees%20SC\"&gt;Majees SC&lt;/a&gt; and qualification for the 2013 AFC Cup.\nIn his first ever appearance in an &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Football%20Confederation\"&gt;Asian Football Confederation&lt;/a&gt; tournament as the head coach of any club, the &lt;a href=\"2013%20AFC%20Cup\"&gt;2013 AFC Cup&lt;/a&gt;, he began his campaign in the third week of the tournament in a 1-0 loss against &lt;a href=\"Erbil%20SC\"&gt;Erbil SC&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. After their first loss in the 2013 edition of the AFC Cup, they next faced the Iraqi side in a home match at &lt;a href=\"Al-Seeb%20Stadium\"&gt;Al-Seeb Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. The visitors shocked the Omani side as the posted a 4-0 victory over Fanja. His side next faced &lt;a href=\"Al-Ansar%20SC\"&gt;Al-Ansar SC&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; away at the &lt;a href=\"Camille%20Chamoun%20Sports%20City%20Stadium\"&gt;Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beirut\"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, whom they had previously defeated 4-0 at home under Omani coach &lt;a href=\"Mohsin%20Al-Kharusi\"&gt;Mohsin Al-Kharusi&lt;/a&gt;. The Lebanese side managed to hold the 2011\u201312 Oman Elite League winners to a 0-0 draw. His side faced &lt;a href=\"Al-Ahli%20Taizz%20S.C.\"&gt;Al-Ahli Taizz S.C.&lt;/a&gt; in their final encounter of the Group Stage and recorded a 3-1 victory over the &lt;a href=\"Yemen\"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;i side thus securing a spot in the Round of 16. In the knockout stage, his side were sorted with a tough opponent, &lt;a href=\"Qadsia%20SC\"&gt;Al-Qadsia SC&lt;/a&gt; and as expected the home team secured a 4-0 victory over the Omani side thus eliminating Hicham Jardrane's side from contention.\nIn his second consecutive appearance in an Asian Football Confederation tournament as the head coach of any club, the &lt;a href=\"2014%20AFC%20Cup\"&gt;2014 AFC Cup&lt;/a&gt;, he faced a tough competition as his side was drawn with &lt;a href=\"2012%20AFC%20Cup\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2013%20AFC%20Cup\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Cup\"&gt;AFC Cup&lt;/a&gt; winners, &lt;a href=\"Kuwait%20SC\"&gt;Kuwait SC&lt;/a&gt;. In his first AFC Cup match on 26 February 2014 against &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n club &lt;a href=\"Al-Jaish%20SC%20%28Damascus%29\"&gt;Al-Jaish SC&lt;/a&gt;, his side disappointed the whole of nation as they were held to a 0-0 draw against a comparatively lower-leveled side. In their second Group B fixture against defending champions &lt;a href=\"Kuwait%20SC\"&gt;Kuwait SC&lt;/a&gt;, Fanja stunned many as they posted a 2-1 victory over the &lt;a href=\"Kuwait\"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;i side. They next faced &lt;a href=\"Nejmeh%20SC\"&gt;Nejmeh SC&lt;/a&gt; of Lebanon in an away match but the visitors failed to even get a point from the tie as the Lebanese side secured a 1-0 victory over Fanja SC. In their next encounter against the same Lebanese side at home, Fanja managed to secure a point as the match ended in a 0-0 draw at Al-Seeb Stadium. On 5 April 2013, Hicham's side faced relegation threatened &lt;a href=\"Sohar%20SC\"&gt;Sohar SC&lt;/a&gt; in an OPL match at the &lt;a href=\"Sohar%20Regional%20Sports%20Complex\"&gt;Sohar Regional Sports Complex&lt;/a&gt; and the Spanish coach's side had to face a 1-0 loss against the home side. On 6 April 2013, Hicham stepped down as the head coach of Fanja SC citing medical reasons but the football pundits in Oman claimed that this resignation came as a result of the club's 1-0 loss against Sohar SC.\nAl-Nahda.\nAl-Nahda Club\nIn June 2015, news speculated that Hicham will return to the Middle East and more accurately to Oman where he would coach Omani giants, &lt;a href=\"Dhofar%20S.C.S.C.\"&gt;Dhofar S.C.S.C.&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20Oman%20Professional%20League\"&gt;2015\u201316 Oman Professional League&lt;/a&gt; season. However, this deal failed to materialize and as a result he was appointed as the manager of &lt;a href=\"Al%20Buraimi%20Governorate\"&gt;Al-Buraimi&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Al-Nahda%20Club%20%28Oman%29\"&gt;Al-Nahda Club&lt;/a&gt;. On 21 July 2015, he signed a one-year contract to be appointed as the manager of Al-Nahda Club. His club began the &lt;a href=\"2015-16%20Oman%20Professional%20League\"&gt;2015-16 Oman Professional League&lt;/a&gt; campaign on a disappointing note as they faced a huge upset from lower-level side, &lt;a href=\"Al-Musannah%20SC\"&gt;Al-Musannah SC&lt;/a&gt; as they lost 2-1 in their home at the &lt;a href=\"Al-Buraimi%20Sports%20Complex\"&gt;Al-Buraimi Sports Complex&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuildcon Football Club.\nIn February 2017, Hicham Jadrane Chazouani engaged with the club of Zambian Superleague Buildcon Football Club. It's his second experience in Africa after Morocco\nAl-Shamal SC.\nOn July 6, 2018, Hicham Jadrane signed in the Qatari club of Al Shamal SC\nAdministrative roles.\nHicham, besides being a football manager, is also a football lecturer, football pundit and a commentator. In 2004, he worked as a football pundit for TV Almer\u00eda. In 2009, he worked as a football pundit in &lt;a href=\"Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nationale%20de%20Radiodiffusion%20et%20de%20T%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision\"&gt;SNRT Maroc&lt;/a&gt; and recently was the commentator for the &lt;a href=\"2014%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2014 FIFA Club World Cup&lt;/a&gt; finals between &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid C.F.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Lorenzo%20de%20Almagro\"&gt;San Lorenzo de Almagro&lt;/a&gt; which was played in the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20de%20Marrakech\"&gt;Stade de Marrakech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marrakesh\"&gt;Marrakesh&lt;/a&gt;."
