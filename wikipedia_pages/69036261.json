This meant that Porsche could use their F2 cars almost unchanged in F1. The 787 would not get the eight-cylinder though, continuing with the air-cooled, &lt;a href=\"Overhead%20camshaft%23Dual%20overhead%20camshaft\"&gt;DOHC&lt;/a&gt; four-cylinder Type 547 &lt;a href=\"Flat%20engine%23Boxer%20engine\"&gt;boxer engine&lt;/a&gt; that had been developed by &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20Fuhrmann\"&gt;Ernst Fuhrmann&lt;/a&gt; and that had powered the 550 Spyders and 718 series until then. It was powered by a 547/3 four-cylinder engine with Kugelfischer &lt;a href=\"fuel%20injection\"&gt;fuel injection&lt;/a&gt;. At Monaco the car retired when the fuel injection cut out. A second car, also fitted with the 547/3 engine, was completed in time to appear in the Dutch Grand Prix on 22 May alongside the other 787. "
