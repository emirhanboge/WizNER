    "text": "Augusto Sabbo was born in &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; but studied in Germany, where he played &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; at the Saxony-based Mittweidaer BC. Having graduated in engineering, he directed the assembly of the electric traction network of the city of &lt;a href=\"Coimbra\"&gt;Coimbra&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly career.\nReturning to Portugal, he shined in the &lt;a href=\"Club%20Internacional%20de%20Foot-ball\"&gt;CIF&lt;/a&gt;, at the beginning of the 20th century, as captain of the team and his coach, with innovative methods of training, managing to form the so-called wonder team.\nAs a coach he was studious and methodical, having introduced into the &lt;a href=\"Club%20Internacional%20de%20Foot-ball\"&gt;CIF&lt;/a&gt; the famous \"theory of triangulation\", which years later came to be implanted in &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Sporting Clube de Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. According to his conceptions of &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, Augusto Sabbo argued that players should not make moves according to the circumstances, but rather make a movement that forces the opponent to execute a movement which is of interest to the team, allowing the strategized bursts of play happen as was imagined.\nNational coach.\nIn 1921, he was chosen to be the first National Coach, but the players did not like the hardness of his methods and he ended up not guiding any of the National Team's games.\nTime at Sporting CP.\nSabbo started his time as Sporting's coach in the season 1921/22, probably in January, going on to conquer the 3rd &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20de%20Lisboa\"&gt;Lisbon Championship&lt;/a&gt; in the history of the club, and reaching in the final of the first &lt;a href=\"Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese Championship&lt;/a&gt;, which Sporting lost in an &lt;a href=\"1922%20Campeonato%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;epic final&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;FC Porto&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 1922\u201323 season was of particular note, leading Sporting to their first &lt;a href=\"Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese Championship&lt;/a&gt; title, and winning the &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20de%20Lisboa\"&gt;Lisbon Championship&lt;/a&gt; again.\nHe remained at Sporting until February 1923, when he resigned after the Technical Council denied him the freedom to assemble the team, but returned at the beginning of the following season, resigning again in February 1924.\nIn 1923, Sabbo edited in &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; a detailed 75-page manual titled \"Football (T\u00e9cnica e Did\u00e1ctica de Jogo)\", which discussed all the important aspects of football.\nHe would return to Sporting in 1926, becoming the first paid coach of the club. After the attendance of the players to the training sessions dwindled to low levels, the club, seeing itself in a time of crisis, dismissed Sabbo in January 1927.\n\"Escola do Barreiro\".\nAfter his time at Sporting, Sabbo went on to coach &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Barreirense\"&gt;Barreirense&lt;/a&gt; from the 1926\u201327 season to the 1929\u201330, later returning for two stints, the first during the 1933\u201334 and 1934\u201335 seasons, and the second during the 1939\u201340 and 1940\u201341 seasons. During his stay at Barreirense Sabbo went on to create tactical system entitled \"Escola do &lt;a href=\"Barreiro%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Barreiro&lt;/a&gt;\", a system that remained in use at the Barreiro-based club even after his departure. During his tenure he led the team to the &lt;a href=\"Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese Championship&lt;/a&gt; final twice.\nLife outside coaching.\nIn addition to being a football coach he was also a &lt;a href=\"referee\"&gt;referee&lt;/a&gt; and part of Sporting's first &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; teams.\nSabbo died on October 30, 1971."
