    "text": "England is a &lt;a href=\"Countries%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;country&lt;/a&gt; that is part of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. It shares land borders with &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; to its west and &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; to its north. The &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Sea\"&gt;Irish Sea&lt;/a&gt; lies northwest of England and the &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Sea\"&gt;Celtic Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest. England is separated from &lt;a href=\"continental%20Europe\"&gt;continental Europe&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the east and the &lt;a href=\"English%20Channel\"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt; to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, which lies in the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean%23Northern%20Atlantic\"&gt;North Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;, and includes &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20islands%20of%20England\"&gt;over 100 smaller islands&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Isles%20of%20Scilly\"&gt;Isles of Scilly&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Wight\"&gt;Isle of Wight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Paleolithic\"&gt;Upper Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; period, but takes its name from the &lt;a href=\"Angles\"&gt;Angles&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20peoples\"&gt;Germanic&lt;/a&gt; tribe deriving its name from the &lt;a href=\"Anglia%20%28peninsula%29\"&gt;Anglia&lt;/a&gt; peninsula, who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries. England became a unified state in the 10th century and has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world since the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Discovery\"&gt;Age of Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, which began during the 15th century. The &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English language&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Communion\"&gt;Anglican Church&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"English%20law\"&gt;English law&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the basis for the &lt;a href=\"common%20law\"&gt;common law&lt;/a&gt; legal systems of many other countries around the world\u2014developed in England, and the country's &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;parliamentary system&lt;/a&gt; of government has been widely adopted by other nations. The &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt; began in 18th-century England, transforming its society into the world's first industrialised nation.\nEngland's terrain is chiefly low hills and &lt;a href=\"plain\"&gt;plain&lt;/a&gt;s, especially in central and southern England. However, there is upland and mountainous terrain in the north (for example, the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District\"&gt;Lake District&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pennines\"&gt;Pennines&lt;/a&gt;) and in the west (for example, &lt;a href=\"Dartmoor\"&gt;Dartmoor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shropshire%20Hills\"&gt;Shropshire Hills&lt;/a&gt;). The capital is &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, which has the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom. England's population of 56.3\u00a0million comprises 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, largely concentrated around London, the &lt;a href=\"South%20East%20England\"&gt;South East&lt;/a&gt;, and conurbations in the &lt;a href=\"Midlands\"&gt;Midlands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"North%20West%20England\"&gt;North West&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"North%20East%20England\"&gt;North East&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20England\"&gt;Kingdom of England&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 which after 1535 included Wales \u2013 ceased being a separate &lt;a href=\"sovereign%20state\"&gt;sovereign state&lt;/a&gt; on 1 May 1707, when the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Union%201707\"&gt;Acts of Union&lt;/a&gt; put into effect the terms agreed in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Union\"&gt;Treaty of Union&lt;/a&gt; the previous year, resulting in a political union with the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Kingdom of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; to create the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Kingdom of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;. In 1801, Great Britain was united with the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Kingdom of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; (through another &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Union%201800\"&gt;Act of Union&lt;/a&gt;) to become the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. In 1922 the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt; seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being &lt;a href=\"Royal%20and%20Parliamentary%20Titles%20Act%201927\"&gt;renamed&lt;/a&gt; the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nToponymy.\nThe name \"England\" is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; name \"Englaland\", which means \"land of the &lt;a href=\"Angles\"&gt;Angles&lt;/a&gt;\". The Angles were one of the &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20tribes\"&gt;Germanic tribes&lt;/a&gt; that settled in Great Britain during the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Early Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. The Angles came from the &lt;a href=\"Anglia%20%28peninsula%29\"&gt;Anglia&lt;/a&gt; peninsula in the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Kiel\"&gt;Bay of Kiel&lt;/a&gt; area (present-day German state of &lt;a href=\"Schleswig%E2%80%93Holstein\"&gt;Schleswig\u2013Holstein&lt;/a&gt;) of the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The earliest recorded use of the term, as \"Engla londe\", is in the late-ninth-century translation into &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bede\"&gt;Bede&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People\"&gt;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&lt;/a&gt;\". The term was then used in a different sense to the modern one, meaning \"the land inhabited by the English\", and it included English people in what is now south-east Scotland but was then part of the English kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Northumbria\"&gt;Northumbria&lt;/a&gt;. The \"&lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\" recorded that the &lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt; of 1086 covered the whole of England, meaning the English kingdom, but a few years later the \"Chronicle\" stated that King &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20III\"&gt;Malcolm III&lt;/a&gt; went \"out of Scotlande into &lt;a href=\"Lothian\"&gt;Lothian&lt;/a&gt; in Englaland\", thus using it in the more ancient sense.\nThe earliest attested reference to the Angles occurs in the 1st-century work by &lt;a href=\"Tacitus\"&gt;Tacitus&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Germania%20%28book%29\"&gt;Germania&lt;/a&gt;\", in which the &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; word \"Anglii\" is used. The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; it has been suggested that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an \"angular\" shape. How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the &lt;a href=\"Saxons\"&gt;Saxons&lt;/a&gt;, came to be used for the entire country and its people is not known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain \"Angli Saxones\" or English Saxons to distinguish them from continental Saxons (Eald-Seaxe) of Old Saxony between the Weser and Eider rivers in Northern Germany. In &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Gaelic\"&gt;Scottish Gaelic&lt;/a&gt;, another language which developed on the island of Great Britain, the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England (\"Sasunn\"); similarly, the Welsh name for the English language is \"Saesneg\". A romantic name for England is &lt;a href=\"Lloegyr\"&gt;Loegria&lt;/a&gt;, related to the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; word for England, \"Lloegr\", and made popular by its use in &lt;a href=\"Arthurian%20legend\"&gt;Arthurian legend&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Albion\"&gt;Albion&lt;/a&gt;\" is also applied to England in a more poetic capacity, though its original meaning is the island of Britain as a whole.\nHistory.\nPrehistory and antiquity.\nThe earliest known evidence of human presence in the area now known as England was that of \"&lt;a href=\"Homo%20antecessor\"&gt;Homo antecessor&lt;/a&gt;\", dating to approximately 780,000 years ago. The oldest proto-human bones discovered in England date from 500,000\u00a0years ago. Modern humans are known to have inhabited the area during the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Paleolithic\"&gt;Upper Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; period, though permanent settlements were only established within the last 6,000 years.\nAfter the last &lt;a href=\"Last%20glacial%20period\"&gt;ice age&lt;/a&gt; only large mammals such as &lt;a href=\"mammoth\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bison\"&gt;bison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"woolly%20rhinoceros\"&gt;woolly rhinoceros&lt;/a&gt; remained. Roughly 11,000\u00a0years ago, when the &lt;a href=\"ice%20sheets\"&gt;ice sheets&lt;/a&gt; began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from the northern part of the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by &lt;a href=\"land%20bridge\"&gt;land bridge&lt;/a&gt; to Ireland and &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the seas rose, it was separated from Ireland 10,000\u00a0years ago and from Eurasia two millennia later.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Beaker%20culture\"&gt;Beaker culture&lt;/a&gt; arrived around 2,500\u00a0BC, introducing drinking and food vessels constructed from clay, as well as vessels used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores. It was during this time that major &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; monuments such as &lt;a href=\"Stonehenge\"&gt;Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avebury\"&gt;Avebury&lt;/a&gt; were constructed. By heating together tin and copper, which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt;, and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt; allowed the construction of better &lt;a href=\"plough\"&gt;plough&lt;/a&gt;s, advancing agriculture (for instance, with &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20field\"&gt;Celtic field&lt;/a&gt;s), as well as the production of more effective weapons.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"British%20Iron%20Age\"&gt;Iron Age&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celtic culture&lt;/a&gt;, deriving from the &lt;a href=\"Hallstatt%20culture\"&gt;Hallstatt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"La%20T%C3%A8ne%20culture\"&gt;La T\u00e8ne culture&lt;/a&gt;s, arrived from Central Europe. &lt;a href=\"British%20language%20%28Celtic%29\"&gt;Brythonic&lt;/a&gt; was the spoken language during this time. Society was tribal; according to &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy\"&gt;Ptolemy&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Geographia\"&gt;Geographia&lt;/a&gt;\" there were around 20 tribes in the area. Earlier divisions are unknown because the Britons were not literate. Like other regions on the edge of the Empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans. Julius Caesar of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Roman Republic&lt;/a&gt; attempted to &lt;a href=\"Caesar%27s%20invasions%20of%20Britain\"&gt;invade twice&lt;/a&gt; in 55\u00a0BC; although largely unsuccessful, he managed to set up a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20client%20kingdoms%20in%20Britain\"&gt;client king&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Trinovantes\"&gt;Trinovantes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Romans invaded Britain in 43 AD during the reign of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Claudius\"&gt;Claudius&lt;/a&gt;, subsequently &lt;a href=\"Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain\"&gt;conquering much of Britain&lt;/a&gt;, and the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire as &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Britannia province&lt;/a&gt;. The best-known of the native tribes who attempted to resist were the &lt;a href=\"Catuvellauni\"&gt;Catuvellauni&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Caratacus\"&gt;Caratacus&lt;/a&gt;. Later, an uprising led by &lt;a href=\"Boudica\"&gt;Boudica&lt;/a&gt;, Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Iceni\"&gt;Iceni&lt;/a&gt;, ended with Boudica's suicide following her defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Defeat%20of%20Boudica\"&gt;Battle of Watling Street&lt;/a&gt;. The author of one study of Roman Britain suggested that from 43 AD to 84 AD, the Roman invaders killed somewhere between 100,000 and 250,000 people from a population of perhaps 2,000,000. This era saw a &lt;a href=\"Greco-Roman\"&gt;Greco-Roman&lt;/a&gt; culture prevail with the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20law\"&gt;Roman law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20architecture\"&gt;Roman architecture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20aqueducts%20in%20the%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;aqueducts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sanitation%20in%20ancient%20Rome\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt;, many agricultural items and silk. In the 3rd century, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Septimius%20Severus\"&gt;Septimius Severus&lt;/a&gt; died at &lt;a href=\"Eboracum\"&gt;Eboracum&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;), where &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Constantine&lt;/a&gt; was subsequently proclaimed emperor a century later.\nThere is debate about when Christianity was first introduced; it was no later than the 4th century, probably much earlier. According to &lt;a href=\"Bede\"&gt;Bede&lt;/a&gt;, missionaries were sent from Rome by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Eleuterus\"&gt;Eleutherius&lt;/a&gt; at the request of the chieftain &lt;a href=\"Lucius%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Lucius of Britain&lt;/a&gt; in 180 AD, to settle differences as to Eastern and Western ceremonials, which were disturbing the church. There are traditions linked to Glastonbury claiming an introduction through &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20of%20Arimathea\"&gt;Joseph of Arimathea&lt;/a&gt;, while others claim through &lt;a href=\"Lucius%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Lucius of Britain&lt;/a&gt;. By 410, during the &lt;a href=\"Decline%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Decline of the Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Britain was left exposed by the &lt;a href=\"end%20of%20Roman%20rule%20in%20Britain\"&gt;end of Roman rule in Britain&lt;/a&gt; and the withdrawal of Roman army units, to defend the frontiers in continental Europe and partake in civil wars. Celtic Christian monastic and missionary movements flourished: &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Patrick\"&gt;Patrick&lt;/a&gt; (5th-century Ireland) and in the 6th century Brendan (Clonfert), Comgall (Bangor), David (Wales), Aiden (Lindisfarne) and Columba (Iona). This period of Christianity was influenced by ancient Celtic culture in its sensibilities, polity, practices and theology. Local \"congregations\" were centred in the monastic community and monastic leaders were more like chieftains, as peers, rather than in the more hierarchical system of the Roman-dominated church.\nMiddle Ages.\n&lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman military&lt;/a&gt; withdrawals left Britain open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, &lt;a href=\"Angles\"&gt;Angles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jutes\"&gt;Jutes&lt;/a&gt; and Frisians who had long raided the coasts of the Roman province. These groups then began to settle in increasing numbers over the course of the fifth and sixth centuries, initially in the eastern part of the country. Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Badon\"&gt;Battle of Mount Badon&lt;/a&gt;, but subsequently resumed, overrunning the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under &lt;a href=\"Britons%20%28historical%29\"&gt;Brittonic&lt;/a&gt; control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Age\"&gt;Dark Age&lt;/a&gt;. The nature and progression of the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20settlement%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain&lt;/a&gt; is consequently subject to considerable disagreement; the emerging consensus is that it occurred on a large scale in the south and east but was less substantial to the north and west, where Celtic languages continued to be spoken even in areas under Anglo-Saxon control. Roman-dominated Christianity had, in general, been replaced in the conquered territories by &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20paganism\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon paganism&lt;/a&gt;, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by &lt;a href=\"Augustine%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Augustine&lt;/a&gt; from 597 onwards. Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Whitby\"&gt;Council of Whitby&lt;/a&gt; (664), which was ostensibly about &lt;a href=\"tonsure\"&gt;tonsure&lt;/a&gt;s (clerical haircuts) and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice.\nDuring the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including &lt;a href=\"Northumbria\"&gt;Northumbria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercia\"&gt;Mercia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wessex\"&gt;Wessex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia\"&gt;East Anglia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Essex\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sussex\"&gt;Sussex&lt;/a&gt;. Over the following centuries, this process of political consolidation continued. The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence. In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the &lt;a href=\"Danes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29\"&gt;Danes&lt;/a&gt; culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20the%20Great\"&gt;Alfred the Great&lt;/a&gt; was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors, it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Danelaw\"&gt;Danelaw&lt;/a&gt;. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under &lt;a href=\"%C3%86thelstan\"&gt;\u00c6thelstan&lt;/a&gt; in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by &lt;a href=\"Eadred\"&gt;Eadred&lt;/a&gt; in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by &lt;a href=\"Sweyn%20Forkbeard\"&gt;Sweyn Forkbeard&lt;/a&gt; in 1013 and again by his son &lt;a href=\"Cnut%20the%20Great\"&gt;Cnut&lt;/a&gt; in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20Empire\"&gt;North Sea Empire&lt;/a&gt; that also included &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. However, the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of &lt;a href=\"Edward%20the%20Confessor\"&gt;Edward the Confessor&lt;/a&gt; in 1042.\nA dispute over the succession to Edward led to the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Conquest\"&gt;Norman Conquest&lt;/a&gt; in 1066, accomplished by an army led by &lt;a href=\"William%20the%20Conqueror\"&gt;Duke William of Normandy&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Normans\"&gt;Normans&lt;/a&gt; themselves originated from &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt; and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language.\nSubsequently, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plantagenet\"&gt;House of Plantagenet&lt;/a&gt; from Anjou inherited the English throne under &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry II&lt;/a&gt;, adding England to the budding &lt;a href=\"Angevin%20Empire\"&gt;Angevin Empire&lt;/a&gt; of fiefs the family had inherited in France including &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine\"&gt;Aquitaine&lt;/a&gt;. They reigned for three centuries, some noted monarchs being &lt;a href=\"Richard%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Richard I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20V%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry V&lt;/a&gt;. The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including the signing of the \"&lt;a href=\"Magna%20Carta\"&gt;Magna Carta&lt;/a&gt;\", an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign's powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen. Catholic &lt;a href=\"monasticism\"&gt;monasticism&lt;/a&gt; flourished, providing philosophers, and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage. The &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Principality of Wales&lt;/a&gt; became a Plantagenet fief during the 13th century and the &lt;a href=\"Lordship%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Lordship of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; was given to the English monarchy by the Pope.\nDuring the 14th century, the Plantagenets and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Valois\"&gt;House of Valois&lt;/a&gt; both claimed to be legitimate claimants to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Capet\"&gt;House of Capet&lt;/a&gt; and with it France; the two powers clashed in the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years' War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Death\"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt; epidemic &lt;a href=\"Black%20Death%20in%20England\"&gt;hit England&lt;/a&gt;; starting in 1348, it eventually killed up to half of England's &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20demography\"&gt;inhabitants&lt;/a&gt;. From 1453 to 1487 civil war occurred between two branches of the royal family \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20York\"&gt;Yorkists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;Lancastrians&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 known as the &lt;a href=\"Wars%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;Wars of the Roses&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually it led to the Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Tudor\"&gt;Tudors&lt;/a&gt;, a branch of the Lancastrians headed by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry Tudor&lt;/a&gt; who invaded with Welsh and Breton mercenaries, gaining victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bosworth%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Bosworth Field&lt;/a&gt; where the Yorkist king &lt;a href=\"Richard%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Richard III&lt;/a&gt; was killed.\nEarly modern.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20period\"&gt;Tudor period&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; reached England through Italian courtiers, who reintroduced artistic, educational and scholarly debate from classical antiquity. England began to develop &lt;a href=\"English%20Navy\"&gt;naval skills&lt;/a&gt;, and exploration to the West intensified. &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; broke from communion with the Catholic Church, over issues relating to his divorce, under the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Supremacy\"&gt;Acts of Supremacy&lt;/a&gt; in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, the &lt;a href=\"English%20Reformation\"&gt;roots of the split&lt;/a&gt; were more political than theological. He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the &lt;a href=\"Laws%20in%20Wales%20Acts%201535%E2%80%931542\"&gt;1535\u20131542 acts&lt;/a&gt;. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, &lt;a href=\"Mary%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Mary I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Elizabeth I&lt;/a&gt;. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting the supremacy of &lt;a href=\"Anglicanism\"&gt;Anglicanism&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Elizabethan%20era\"&gt;Elizabethan era&lt;/a&gt; is the epoch in the &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20period\"&gt;Tudor age&lt;/a&gt; of the reign of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20I\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth I&lt;/a&gt; (\"the Virgin Queen\"). Historians often depict it as the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20age%20%28metaphor%29\"&gt;golden age&lt;/a&gt; in English history. &lt;a href=\"Elizabethan%20era\"&gt;Elizabethan England&lt;/a&gt; represented the apogee of the &lt;a href=\"English%20Renaissance\"&gt;English Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; and saw the flowering of art, poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for its drama, theatre and playwrights. England during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government as a result of vast Tudor reforms. \nCompeting with &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Empire\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, the first English colony in the Americas was founded in 1585 by explorer &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Raleigh\"&gt;Walter Raleigh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and named &lt;a href=\"Roanoke%20Colony\"&gt;Roanoke&lt;/a&gt;. The Roanoke colony failed and is known as the lost colony after it was found abandoned on the return of the late-arriving supply ship. With the &lt;a href=\"East%20India%20Company\"&gt;East India Company&lt;/a&gt;, England also competed with the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Empire\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; in the East. During the &lt;a href=\"Elizabethan%20period\"&gt;Elizabethan period&lt;/a&gt;, England was at war with Spain. An &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Armada\"&gt;armada&lt;/a&gt; sailed from Spain in 1588 as part of a wider plan to invade England and re-establish a Catholic monarchy. The plan was thwarted by bad coordination, stormy weather and successful harrying attacks by an English fleet under &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Howard%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Nottingham\"&gt;Lord Howard of Effingham&lt;/a&gt;. This failure did not end the threat: Spain launched two further armadas, in &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Spanish%20Armada\"&gt;1596&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Spanish%20Armada\"&gt;1597&lt;/a&gt;, but both were driven back by storms. The political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Scots\"&gt;King of Scots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20VI%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;James VI&lt;/a&gt;, a kingdom which had been a long-time rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as &lt;a href=\"James%20VI%20and%20I\"&gt;James I&lt;/a&gt;, thereby creating a &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20the%20Crowns\"&gt;personal union&lt;/a&gt;. He styled himself &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;King of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, although this had no basis in English law. Under the auspices of King James VI and I the Authorised &lt;a href=\"King%20James%20Version\"&gt;King James Version&lt;/a&gt; of the Holy Bible was published in 1611. It was the standard version of the Bible read by most Protestant Christians for four hundred years until modern revisions were produced in the 20th century.\nBased on conflicting political, religious and social positions, the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt; was fought between the supporters of &lt;a href=\"Long%20Parliament\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; and those of King &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles I&lt;/a&gt;, known colloquially as &lt;a href=\"Roundhead\"&gt;Roundhead&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Cavalier\"&gt;Cavalier&lt;/a&gt;s respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted &lt;a href=\"Wars%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Wars of the Three Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, involving &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The Parliamentarians were victorious, &lt;a href=\"execution%20of%20Charles%20I\"&gt;Charles I was executed&lt;/a&gt; and the kingdom replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20England\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;. Leader of the Parliament forces, &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Cromwell\"&gt;Oliver Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; declared himself &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Protector\"&gt;Lord Protector&lt;/a&gt; in 1653; a period of &lt;a href=\"the%20Protectorate\"&gt;personal rule&lt;/a&gt; followed. After Cromwell's death and the resignation of his son &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Cromwell\"&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; as Lord Protector, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles II&lt;/a&gt; was invited to return as monarch in 1660, in a move called the &lt;a href=\"English%20Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;. With the reopening of theatres, fine arts, literature and performing arts flourished throughout the &lt;a href=\"English%20Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; of \"the Merry Monarch\" &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles II&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Glorious%20Revolution\"&gt;Glorious Revolution&lt;/a&gt; of 1688, it was constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together, though Parliament would have the real power. This was established with the &lt;a href=\"Bill%20of%20Rights%201689\"&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt; in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament and could not be suspended by the King, also that the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without the prior approval of Parliament. Also since that time, no British monarch has entered the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; when it is sitting, which is annually commemorated at the &lt;a href=\"State%20Opening%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;State Opening of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; by the British monarch when the doors of the House of Commons are slammed in the face of the monarch's messenger, symbolising the rights of Parliament and its independence from the monarch. With the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society\"&gt;Royal Society&lt;/a&gt; in 1660, science was greatly encouraged.\nIn 1666 the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Fire%20of%20London\"&gt;Great Fire of London&lt;/a&gt; gutted the City of London but it was rebuilt shortly afterwards with many significant buildings designed by Sir &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Wren\"&gt;Christopher Wren&lt;/a&gt;. In Parliament two factions had emerged \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Tory\"&gt;Tories&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whig%20%28British%20political%20faction%29\"&gt;Whigs&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Tories initially supported Catholic king &lt;a href=\"James%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;James II&lt;/a&gt;, some of them, along with the Whigs, during the &lt;a href=\"Glorious%20Revolution\"&gt;Revolution of 1688&lt;/a&gt; invited Dutch prince William of Orange to defeat James and ultimately to become &lt;a href=\"William%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;William III of England&lt;/a&gt;. Some English people, especially in the north, were &lt;a href=\"Jacobitism\"&gt;Jacobites&lt;/a&gt; and continued to support James and his sons. Under the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Stuart\"&gt;Stuart dynasty&lt;/a&gt; England expanded in trade, finance and prosperity. Britain developed Europe's largest merchant fleet. After the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed, the two countries joined in &lt;a href=\"political%20union\"&gt;political union&lt;/a&gt;, to create the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Kingdom of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; in 1707. To accommodate the union, institutions such as the law and national churches of each remained separate.\nLate modern and contemporary.\nUnder the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain, output from the Royal Society and other &lt;a href=\"English%20Enlightenment\"&gt;English initiatives&lt;/a&gt; combined with the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Scottish Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; to create innovations in science and engineering, while the enormous growth in &lt;a href=\"Triangular%20trade\"&gt;British overseas trade&lt;/a&gt; protected by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; paved the way for the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Domestically it drove the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, a period of profound change in the &lt;a href=\"socioeconomics\"&gt;socioeconomic&lt;/a&gt; and cultural conditions of England, resulting in industrialised agriculture, manufacture, engineering and mining, as well as new and pioneering road, rail and water networks to facilitate their expansion and development. The opening of Northwest England's &lt;a href=\"Bridgewater%20Canal\"&gt;Bridgewater Canal&lt;/a&gt; in 1761 ushered in the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20British%20canal%20system\"&gt;canal age in Britain&lt;/a&gt;. In 1825 the world's first permanent steam locomotive-hauled passenger railway \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Stockton%20and%20Darlington%20Railway\"&gt;Stockton and Darlington Railway&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 opened to the public. \nDuring the Industrial Revolution, many workers moved from England's countryside to new and expanding urban industrial areas to work in factories, for instance at &lt;a href=\"Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed \"Workshop of the World\" and \"Warehouse City\" respectively. Manchester was the world's first industrial city. England maintained relative stability throughout the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger\"&gt;William Pitt the Younger&lt;/a&gt; was British Prime Minister for the reign of &lt;a href=\"George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;George III&lt;/a&gt;. The Regency of &lt;a href=\"George%20IV\"&gt;George IV&lt;/a&gt; is noted for its elegance and achievements in the fine arts and architecture. During the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt; planned to &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%27s%20planned%20invasion%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;invade from the south-east&lt;/a&gt;. However this failed to manifest and the Napoleonic forces were defeated by the British: at sea by &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson\"&gt;Lord Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, and on land by the &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington\"&gt;Duke of Wellington&lt;/a&gt;. The major victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Trafalgar\"&gt;Battle of Trafalgar&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the naval supremacy Britain had established during the course of the eighteenth century. The Napoleonic Wars fostered a concept of &lt;a href=\"Britishness\"&gt;Britishness&lt;/a&gt; and a united national &lt;a href=\"British%20people\"&gt;British people&lt;/a&gt;, shared with the English, Scots and Welsh.\nLondon became the largest and most populous metropolitan area in the world during the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt;, and trade within the British Empire \u2013 as well as the standing of the British military and navy \u2013 was prestigious. Technologically, this era saw many innovations that proved key to the United Kingdom's power and prosperity. Political agitation at home from radicals such as the &lt;a href=\"Chartism\"&gt;Chartists&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"suffragette\"&gt;suffragette&lt;/a&gt;s enabled legislative reform and &lt;a href=\"universal%20suffrage\"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Hynes\"&gt;Samuel Hynes&lt;/a&gt; described the &lt;a href=\"Edwardian%20era\"&gt;Edwardian era&lt;/a&gt; as a \"leisurely time when women wore &lt;a href=\"Picture%20hat\"&gt;picture hats&lt;/a&gt; and did not vote, when the rich were not ashamed to live conspicuously, and the sun really never set on the British flag.\"\nPower shifts in east-central Europe led to World War I; hundreds of thousands of English soldiers died fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Allies&lt;/a&gt;. Two decades later, in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the United Kingdom was again one of the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allies&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"Phoney%20War\"&gt;Phoney War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Churchill\"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt; became the wartime Prime Minister. Developments in warfare technology saw many cities damaged by air-raids during &lt;a href=\"the%20Blitz\"&gt;the Blitz&lt;/a&gt;. Following the war, the British Empire experienced rapid &lt;a href=\"decolonisation\"&gt;decolonisation&lt;/a&gt;, and there was a speeding-up of technological innovations; automobiles became the primary means of transport and &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Whittle\"&gt;Frank Whittle&lt;/a&gt;'s development of the &lt;a href=\"jet%20engine\"&gt;jet engine&lt;/a&gt; led to wider &lt;a href=\"air%20travel\"&gt;air travel&lt;/a&gt;. Residential patterns were altered in England by private motoring, and by the creation of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29\"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt; (NHS) in 1948. The UK's NHS provided &lt;a href=\"publicly%20funded%20health%20care\"&gt;publicly funded health care&lt;/a&gt; to all UK permanent residents free at the point of need, being paid for from general taxation. Combined, these prompted the reform of &lt;a href=\"local%20government%20in%20England\"&gt;local government in England&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-20th century.\nSince the 20th century there has been significant population movement to England, mostly from other parts of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Isles\"&gt;British Isles&lt;/a&gt;, but also from the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20subcontinent\"&gt;Indian subcontinent&lt;/a&gt;. Since the 1970s there has been a large move away from manufacturing and an increasing emphasis on the &lt;a href=\"service%20industry\"&gt;service industry&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the United Kingdom, the area joined a &lt;a href=\"common%20market\"&gt;common market&lt;/a&gt; initiative called the &lt;a href=\"European%20Economic%20Community\"&gt;European Economic Community&lt;/a&gt; which became the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. Since the late 20th century the &lt;a href=\"politics%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;administration of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has moved towards &lt;a href=\"devolution\"&gt;devolved governance&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. &lt;a href=\"England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;England and Wales&lt;/a&gt; continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the United Kingdom. Devolution has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more English-specific identity and patriotism. There is no devolved English government, but an attempt to create a similar system on a sub-regional basis was rejected by referendum.\nGovernance.\nPolitics.\nEngland is part of the United Kingdom, a &lt;a href=\"constitutional%20monarchy\"&gt;constitutional monarchy&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20system\"&gt;parliamentary system&lt;/a&gt;. There has not been a &lt;a href=\"government%20of%20England\"&gt;government of England&lt;/a&gt; since 1707, when the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Union%201707\"&gt;Acts of Union 1707&lt;/a&gt;, putting into effect the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Union\"&gt;Treaty of Union&lt;/a&gt;, joined England and Scotland to form the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Kingdom of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;. Before the union England was ruled by &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20English%20monarchs\"&gt;its monarch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20England\"&gt;Parliament of England&lt;/a&gt;. Today England is governed directly by the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Parliament of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, although other &lt;a href=\"countries%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;countries of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=\"Devolution\"&gt;devolved&lt;/a&gt; governments. In the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; which is the &lt;a href=\"lower%20house\"&gt;lower house&lt;/a&gt; of the British Parliament based at the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Westminster\"&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, there are 532 Members of Parliament (MPs) for constituencies in England, out of the 650 total. As of the &lt;a href=\"2019%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2019 United Kingdom general election&lt;/a&gt;, England is represented by 345 MPs from the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, 179 from the &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, seven from the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, one from the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Party%20of%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Speaker of the House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lindsay%20Hoyle\"&gt;Lindsay Hoyle&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince &lt;a href=\"devolution\"&gt;devolution&lt;/a&gt;, in which other countries of the United Kingdom \u2013 Scotland, Wales and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England. Originally it was planned that various &lt;a href=\"regions%20of%20England\"&gt;regions of England&lt;/a&gt; would be devolved, but following the proposal's rejection by the &lt;a href=\"North%20East%20England\"&gt;North East&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"2004%20North%20East%20England%20devolution%20referendum\"&gt;2004 referendum&lt;/a&gt;, this has not been carried out.\nOne major issue is the &lt;a href=\"West%20Lothian%20question\"&gt;West Lothian question&lt;/a&gt;, in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are able to vote on legislation affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters. This when placed in the context of England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and &lt;a href=\"top-up%20fees\"&gt;free top-up university fees&lt;/a&gt;, has led to a steady rise in &lt;a href=\"English%20nationalism\"&gt;English nationalism&lt;/a&gt;. Some have suggested the creation of a &lt;a href=\"devolved%20English%20parliament\"&gt;devolved English parliament&lt;/a&gt;, while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs.\nLaw.\nThe &lt;a href=\"English%20law\"&gt;English law&lt;/a&gt; legal system, developed over the centuries, is the basis of &lt;a href=\"common%20law\"&gt;common law&lt;/a&gt; legal systems used in most &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; countries and the United States (except &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the legal system of the &lt;a href=\"Courts%20of%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;Courts of England and Wales&lt;/a&gt; continued, under the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Union\"&gt;Treaty of Union&lt;/a&gt;, as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of &lt;a href=\"legal%20precedent\"&gt;legal precedent&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 \"&lt;a href=\"stare%20decisis\"&gt;stare decisis&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2013 to the facts before them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Courts%20of%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;court system&lt;/a&gt; is headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;Court of Appeal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20of%20Justice\"&gt;High Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; for civil cases, and the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Court\"&gt;Crown Court&lt;/a&gt; for criminal cases. The &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Supreme Court of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; is the highest court for criminal and civil cases in &lt;a href=\"England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;. It was created in 2009 after constitutional changes, taking over the &lt;a href=\"judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords\"&gt;judicial functions of the House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;. A decision of the Supreme Court is binding on every other court in the hierarchy, which must follow its directions. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Justice\"&gt;Secretary of State for Justice&lt;/a&gt; is the minister responsible to Parliament for the &lt;a href=\"Judiciaries%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;judiciary&lt;/a&gt;, the court system and prisons and probation in England. Crime increased between 1981 and 1995 but fell by 42% in the period 1995\u20132006. The prison population doubled over the same period, giving it one of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20incarceration%20rate\"&gt;highest incarceration rate&lt;/a&gt; in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000. &lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%27s%20Prison%20Service\"&gt;Her Majesty's Prison Service&lt;/a&gt;, reporting to the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Justice%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Ministry of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, manages most &lt;a href=\"prisons%20in%20England\"&gt;prisons&lt;/a&gt;, housing over 85,000 convicts.\nRegions, counties, and districts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20England\"&gt;subdivisions of England&lt;/a&gt; consist of up to four levels of &lt;a href=\"administrative%20division\"&gt;subnational division&lt;/a&gt; controlled through a variety of types of administrative entities created for the purposes of &lt;a href=\"local%20government%20in%20England\"&gt;local government&lt;/a&gt;. The highest tier of local government were the nine &lt;a href=\"regions%20of%20England\"&gt;regions of England&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"North%20East%20England\"&gt;North East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20West%20England\"&gt;North West&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20and%20the%20Humber\"&gt;Yorkshire and the Humber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Midlands\"&gt;East Midlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20%28region%29\"&gt;West Midlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20of%20England\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20East%20England\"&gt;South East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20West%20England\"&gt;South West&lt;/a&gt;, and London. These were created in 1994 as &lt;a href=\"Government%20Office\"&gt;Government Office&lt;/a&gt;s, used by the UK government to deliver a wide range of policies and programmes regionally, but there are no elected bodies at this level, except in London, and in 2011 the regional government offices were abolished.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"devolution\"&gt;devolution&lt;/a&gt; began to take place in other parts of the United Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Assemblies%20in%20England\"&gt;regional assemblies&lt;/a&gt; as a counterweight. &lt;a href=\"1998%20Greater%20London%20Authority%20referendum\"&gt;London accepted&lt;/a&gt; in 1998: the &lt;a href=\"London%20Assembly\"&gt;London Assembly&lt;/a&gt; was created two years later. However, when the proposal was rejected by the &lt;a href=\"2004%20North%20East%20England%20devolution%20referendum\"&gt;2004 North East England devolution referendum&lt;/a&gt; in the North East, further referendums were cancelled. The regional assemblies outside London were abolished in 2010, and their functions transferred to respective &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Development%20Agency\"&gt;Regional Development Agencies&lt;/a&gt; and a new system of &lt;a href=\"Local%20authority%20leaders%27%20boards\"&gt;Local authority leaders' boards&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelow the regional level, all of England is divided into 48 &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;ceremonial counties&lt;/a&gt;. These are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference and have developed gradually since the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, with some established as recently as 1974. Each has a &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Lieutenant\"&gt;Lord Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff\"&gt;High Sheriff&lt;/a&gt;; these posts are used to represent the &lt;a href=\"British%20monarch\"&gt;British monarch&lt;/a&gt; locally. Outside &lt;a href=\"Greater%20London\"&gt;Greater London&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Isles%20of%20Scilly\"&gt;Isles of Scilly&lt;/a&gt;, England is also divided into 83 &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20and%20non-metropolitan%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties&lt;/a&gt;; these correspond to areas used for the purposes of local government and may consist of a single district or be divided into several.\nThere are six &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20county\"&gt;metropolitan counties&lt;/a&gt; based on the most heavily urbanised areas, which do not have county councils. In these areas the principal authorities are the councils of the subdivisions, the &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20borough\"&gt;metropolitan borough&lt;/a&gt;s. Elsewhere, 27 &lt;a href=\"non-metropolitan%20county\"&gt;non-metropolitan \"shire\" counties&lt;/a&gt; have a &lt;a href=\"county%20council\"&gt;county council&lt;/a&gt; and are divided into districts, each with a district council. They are typically, though not always, found in more rural areas. The remaining non-metropolitan counties are of a single district and usually correspond to large towns or sparsely populated counties; they are known as &lt;a href=\"Unitary%20authorities%20of%20England\"&gt;unitary authorities&lt;/a&gt;. Greater London has a different system for local government, with 32 &lt;a href=\"London%20borough\"&gt;London borough&lt;/a&gt;s, plus the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt; covering a small area at the core governed by the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London%20Corporation\"&gt;City of London Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. At the most localised level, much of England is divided into &lt;a href=\"civil%20parishes%20in%20England\"&gt;civil parishes&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Parish%20councils%20in%20England\"&gt;councils&lt;/a&gt;; in Greater London only one, &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Park%2C%20London\"&gt;Queen's Park&lt;/a&gt;, exists after they were &lt;a href=\"London%20Government%20Act%201963\"&gt;abolished in 1965&lt;/a&gt; until legislation &lt;a href=\"Local%20Government%20and%20Public%20Involvement%20in%20Health%20Act%202007\"&gt;allowed their recreation&lt;/a&gt; in 2007.\nGeography.\nLandscape and rivers.\nGeographically England includes the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus such offshore islands as the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Wight\"&gt;Isle of Wight&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Isles%20of%20Scilly\"&gt;Isles of Scilly&lt;/a&gt;. It is bordered by two other countries of the United Kingdom: &lt;a href=\"Anglo%20Scottish%20border\"&gt;to the north&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland and &lt;a href=\"Wales-England%20border\"&gt;to the west&lt;/a&gt; by Wales. England is closer than any other part of mainland Britain to the European continent. It is separated from &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Hauts-de-France\"&gt;Hauts-de-France&lt;/a&gt;) by a sea gap, though the two countries are connected by the &lt;a href=\"Channel%20Tunnel\"&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Folkestone\"&gt;Folkestone&lt;/a&gt;. England also has shores on the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Sea\"&gt;Irish Sea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; and Atlantic Ocean.\nThe ports of London, &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne\"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; lie on the tidal rivers &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;Thames&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"River%20Mersey\"&gt;Mersey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Tyne\"&gt;Tyne&lt;/a&gt; respectively. At , the &lt;a href=\"River%20Severn\"&gt;Severn&lt;/a&gt; is the longest river flowing through England. It empties into the &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Channel\"&gt;Bristol Channel&lt;/a&gt; and is notable for its &lt;a href=\"Severn%20Bore\"&gt;Severn Bore&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"tidal%20bore\"&gt;tidal bore&lt;/a&gt;), which can reach in height. However, the longest river entirely in England is the Thames, which is in length.\nThere are many &lt;a href=\"lakes%20in%20England\"&gt;lakes in England&lt;/a&gt;; the largest is &lt;a href=\"Windermere\"&gt;Windermere&lt;/a&gt;, within the aptly named &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District\"&gt;Lake District&lt;/a&gt;. Most of England's landscape consists of low hills and plains, with upland and mountainous terrain in the north and west of the country. The northern uplands include the &lt;a href=\"Pennines\"&gt;Pennines&lt;/a&gt;, a chain of uplands dividing east and west, the Lake District mountains in Cumbria, and the &lt;a href=\"Cheviot%20Hills\"&gt;Cheviot Hills&lt;/a&gt;, straddling the border between England and Scotland. The highest point in England, at , is &lt;a href=\"Scafell%20Pike\"&gt;Scafell Pike&lt;/a&gt; in the Lake District. The &lt;a href=\"Shropshire%20Hills\"&gt;Shropshire Hills&lt;/a&gt; are near Wales while &lt;a href=\"Dartmoor\"&gt;Dartmoor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exmoor\"&gt;Exmoor&lt;/a&gt; are two upland areas in the south-west of the country. The approximate dividing line between terrain types is often indicated by the &lt;a href=\"Tees-Exe%20line\"&gt;Tees-Exe line&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn geological terms, the Pennines, known as the \"backbone of England\", are the oldest range of mountains in the country, originating from the end of the &lt;a href=\"Paleozoic%20Era\"&gt;Paleozoic Era&lt;/a&gt; around 300\u00a0million years ago. Their geological composition includes, among others, &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;, and also coal. There are &lt;a href=\"karst\"&gt;karst&lt;/a&gt; landscapes in calcite areas such as parts of &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Derbyshire\"&gt;Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;. The Pennine landscape is high &lt;a href=\"moorland\"&gt;moorland&lt;/a&gt; in upland areas, indented by fertile valleys of the region's rivers. They contain two &lt;a href=\"national%20parks%20in%20England\"&gt;national parks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Dales\"&gt;Yorkshire Dales&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Peak%20District\"&gt;Peak District&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"West%20Country\"&gt;West Country&lt;/a&gt;, Dartmoor and Exmoor of the Southwest Peninsula include upland moorland supported by granite, and enjoy a &lt;a href=\"Climate%20of%20south-west%20England\"&gt;mild climate&lt;/a&gt;; both are national parks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"English%20Lowlands%20beech%20forests\"&gt;English Lowlands&lt;/a&gt; are in the central and southern regions of the country, consisting of green rolling hills, including the &lt;a href=\"Cotswold%20Hills\"&gt;Cotswold Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chiltern%20Hills\"&gt;Chiltern Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Downs\"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Downs\"&gt;South Downs&lt;/a&gt;; where they meet the sea they form white rock exposures such as the &lt;a href=\"cliffs%20of%20Dover\"&gt;cliffs of Dover&lt;/a&gt;. This also includes relatively flat plains such as the &lt;a href=\"Salisbury%20Plain\"&gt;Salisbury Plain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Somerset%20Levels\"&gt;Somerset Levels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Coast%20Plain\"&gt;South Coast Plain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Fens\"&gt;The Fens&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nEngland has a &lt;a href=\"temperate%20climate\"&gt;temperate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"maritime%20climate\"&gt;maritime climate&lt;/a&gt;: it is mild with temperatures not much lower than in winter and not much higher than in summer. The weather is damp relatively frequently and is changeable. The coldest months are January and February, the latter particularly on the &lt;a href=\"Geography%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;English coast&lt;/a&gt;, while July is normally the warmest month. Months with mild to warm weather are May, June, September and October. Rainfall is spread fairly evenly throughout the year.\nImportant influences on the climate of England are its proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, its northern &lt;a href=\"latitude\"&gt;latitude&lt;/a&gt; and the warming of the sea by the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Stream\"&gt;Gulf Stream&lt;/a&gt;. Rainfall is higher in the west, and parts of the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District\"&gt;Lake District&lt;/a&gt; receive more rain than anywhere else in the country. Since weather records began, the highest temperature recorded was on 25 July 2019 at the &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20University%20Botanic%20Garden\"&gt;Botanic Garden&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, while the lowest was on 10 January 1982 in &lt;a href=\"Edgmond%2C%20Shropshire\"&gt;Edgmond&lt;/a&gt;, Shropshire.\nNature and wildlife.\nThe fauna of England is similar to that of other areas in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Isles\"&gt;British Isles&lt;/a&gt; with a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate life in a diverse range of habitats.\n&lt;a href=\"National%20nature%20reserves%20in%20England\"&gt;National nature reserves in England&lt;/a&gt; are designated by &lt;a href=\"Natural%20England\"&gt;Natural England&lt;/a&gt; as key places for &lt;a href=\"wildlife\"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt; and natural features in England. They were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations. NNRs are managed on behalf of the nation, many by Natural England themselves, but also by non-governmental organisations, including the members of &lt;a href=\"The%20Wildlife%20Trusts\"&gt;The Wildlife Trusts&lt;/a&gt; partnership, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;National Trust&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds\"&gt;Royal Society for the Protection of Birds&lt;/a&gt;. There are 229 NNRs in England covering . Often they contain rare species or nationally important species of plants and animals.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Environment%20Agency\"&gt;Environment Agency&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"non-departmental%20public%20body\"&gt;non-departmental public body&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1995 and sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Department%20for%20Environment%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs\"&gt;Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/a&gt; with responsibilities relating to the protection and enhancement of the environment in England. The &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Environment%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs\"&gt;Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/a&gt; is the minister responsible for environmental protection, agriculture, fisheries and rural communities in England.\nEngland has a &lt;a href=\"Oceanic%20climate\"&gt;temperate oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt; in most areas, lacking extremes of cold or heat, but does have a few small areas of &lt;a href=\"Subarctic%20climate\"&gt;subarctic&lt;/a&gt; and warmer areas in &lt;a href=\"South%20West%20England\"&gt;the South West&lt;/a&gt;. Towards the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20England\"&gt;North of England&lt;/a&gt; the climate becomes colder and most of England's mountains and high hills are located here and have a major impact on the climate and thus the local fauna of the areas. &lt;a href=\"Deciduous\"&gt;Deciduous&lt;/a&gt; woodlands are common across all of England and provide a great habitat for much of England's wildlife, but these give way in northern and upland areas of England to &lt;a href=\"coniferous\"&gt;coniferous&lt;/a&gt; forests (mainly plantations) which also benefit certain forms of wildlife. Some species have adapted to the expanded urban environment, particularly the &lt;a href=\"red%20fox\"&gt;red fox&lt;/a&gt;, which is the most successful &lt;a href=\"Urban%20wildlife\"&gt;urban mammal&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"brown%20rat\"&gt;brown rat&lt;/a&gt;, and other animals such as &lt;a href=\"common%20wood%20pigeon\"&gt;common wood pigeon&lt;/a&gt;, both of which thrive in urban and suburban areas.\n&lt;a href=\"Grey%20squirrels\"&gt;Grey squirrels&lt;/a&gt; introduced from eastern America have forced the decline of the native red squirrel due to competition. &lt;a href=\"Red%20squirrels\"&gt;Red squirrels&lt;/a&gt; are now confined to upland and coniferous-forested areas of England, mainly in the north, south west and Isle of Wight. England's climate is very suitable for lagomorphs and the country has rabbits and brown hares which were introduced in Roman times. Mountain hares which are indigenous have now been re-introduced in Derbyshire. The fauna of England has to cope with varying temperatures and conditions, although not extreme they do pose potential challenges and adaptational measures. English fauna has however had to cope with industrialisation, human population densities amongst the highest in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"intensive%20farming\"&gt;intensive farming&lt;/a&gt;, but as England is a developed nation, wildlife and the countryside have entered the &lt;a href=\"English%20people\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; mindset more and the country is very conscientious about preserving its wildlife, environment and countryside.\nMajor conurbations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Greater%20London%20Built-up%20Area\"&gt;Greater London Built-up Area&lt;/a&gt; is by far the largest urban area in England and one of the busiest cities in the world. It is considered a &lt;a href=\"global%20city\"&gt;global city&lt;/a&gt; and has a population larger than any other country in the United Kingdom besides England itself. Other urban areas of considerable size and influence tend to be in &lt;a href=\"northern%20England\"&gt;northern England&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"English%20Midlands\"&gt;English Midlands&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;50 settlements&lt;/a&gt; which have designated &lt;a href=\"City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;city status in England&lt;/a&gt;, while the wider United Kingdom has 66.\nWhile many cities in England are quite large, such as &lt;a href=\"Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheffield\"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne\"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Bradford\"&gt;Bradford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nottingham\"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;, population size is not a prerequisite for city status. Traditionally the status was given to towns with &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cathedrals%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;diocesan cathedrals&lt;/a&gt;, so there are smaller cities like &lt;a href=\"Wells%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Wells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ely%2C%20Cambridgeshire\"&gt;Ely&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ripon\"&gt;Ripon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Truro\"&gt;Truro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chichester\"&gt;Chichester&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomy.\nEngland's economy is one of the largest and most dynamic in the world, with an average &lt;a href=\"GDP%20per%20capita\"&gt;GDP per capita&lt;/a&gt; of \u00a328,100. &lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%27s%20Treasury\"&gt;Her Majesty's Treasury&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer\"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt;, is responsible for developing and executing the government's &lt;a href=\"public%20finance\"&gt;public finance&lt;/a&gt; policy and &lt;a href=\"economic%20policy\"&gt;economic policy&lt;/a&gt;. Usually regarded as a &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20economy\"&gt;mixed market economy&lt;/a&gt;, it has adopted many &lt;a href=\"free%20market\"&gt;free market&lt;/a&gt; principles, yet maintains an advanced social welfare infrastructure. The official currency in England is the &lt;a href=\"pound%20sterling\"&gt;pound sterling&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"ISO%204217\"&gt;ISO 4217&lt;/a&gt; code is GBP. &lt;a href=\"Taxation%20in%20England\"&gt;Taxation in England&lt;/a&gt; is quite competitive when &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20tax%20rates\"&gt;compared&lt;/a&gt; to much of the rest of Europe \u2013 the basic rate of personal tax is 20% on taxable income up to \u00a331,865 above the personal tax-free allowance (normally \u00a310,000), and 40% on any additional earnings above that amount.\nThe economy of England is the largest part of the &lt;a href=\"economy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;UK's economy&lt;/a&gt;, which has the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28PPP%29%20per%20capita\"&gt;18th&lt;/a&gt; highest GDP &lt;a href=\"Purchasing%20power%20parity\"&gt;PPP&lt;/a&gt; per capita in the world. England is a leader in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors and in key technical industries, particularly &lt;a href=\"aerospace\"&gt;aerospace&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"arms%20industry\"&gt;arms industry&lt;/a&gt;, and the manufacturing side of the &lt;a href=\"software%20industry\"&gt;software industry&lt;/a&gt;. London, home to the &lt;a href=\"London%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, the United Kingdom's main &lt;a href=\"stock%20exchange\"&gt;stock exchange&lt;/a&gt; and the largest in Europe, is England's financial centre, with 100 of Europe's 500\u00a0largest corporations being based there. London is the largest financial centre in Europe, and is the second largest in the world. &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; is the largest financial and professional services sector outside London and is the mid tier private equity capital of Europe as well as one of the growing technology hubs of Europe. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20England\"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1694 by Scottish banker &lt;a href=\"William%20Paterson%20%28banker%29\"&gt;William Paterson&lt;/a&gt;, is the United Kingdom's &lt;a href=\"central%20bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt;. Originally established as private banker to the government of England, since 1946 it has been a &lt;a href=\"nationalisation\"&gt;state-owned institution&lt;/a&gt;. The bank has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in &lt;a href=\"England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;, although not in other parts of the United Kingdom. The government has devolved responsibility to the bank's &lt;a href=\"Monetary%20Policy%20Committee%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Monetary Policy Committee&lt;/a&gt; for managing the monetary policy of the country and setting interest rates.\nEngland is highly industrialised, but since the 1970s there has been a decline in traditional heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more &lt;a href=\"service%20industry\"&gt;service industry&lt;/a&gt; oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by &lt;a href=\"pharmaceuticals\"&gt;pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;, cars (although many English &lt;a href=\"marque\"&gt;marque&lt;/a&gt;s are now foreign-owned, such as &lt;a href=\"Land%20Rover\"&gt;Land Rover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lotus%20Cars\"&gt;Lotus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaguar%20Cars\"&gt;Jaguar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bentley\"&gt;Bentley&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"crude%20oil\"&gt;crude oil&lt;/a&gt; and petroleum from the English parts of &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20oil\"&gt;North Sea oil&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Wytch%20Farm\"&gt;Wytch Farm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20engine\"&gt;aircraft engine&lt;/a&gt;s and alcoholic beverages. The &lt;a href=\"creative%20industries\"&gt;creative industries&lt;/a&gt; accounted for 7 per cent GVA in 2005 and grew at an average of 6 per cent per annum between 1997 and 2005. \nMost of the UK's \u00a330\u00a0billion &lt;a href=\"Aerospace%20industry%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;aerospace industry&lt;/a&gt; is primarily based in England. The global market opportunity for UK aerospace manufacturers over the next two decades is estimated at \u00a33.5\u00a0trillion. &lt;a href=\"GKN%20Aerospace\"&gt;GKN Aerospace&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 an expert in metallic and composite aerostructures is involved in almost every civil and military fixed and rotary wing aircraft in production is based in &lt;a href=\"Redditch\"&gt;Redditch&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"BAE%20Systems\"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt; makes large sections of the &lt;a href=\"Typhoon%20Eurofighter\"&gt;Typhoon Eurofighter&lt;/a&gt; at its sub-assembly plant in &lt;a href=\"Samlesbury\"&gt;Samlesbury&lt;/a&gt; and assembles the aircraft for the RAF at its &lt;a href=\"Warton%2C%20Fylde\"&gt;Warton&lt;/a&gt; plant, near &lt;a href=\"Preston%2C%20Lancashire\"&gt;Preston&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2013, the British Government pledged \u00a360 million to the &lt;a href=\"Skylon%20%28spacecraft%29\"&gt;Skylon&lt;/a&gt; project: this investment will provide support at a \"crucial stage\" to allow a full-scale prototype of the &lt;a href=\"SABRE%20%28rocket%20engine%29\"&gt;SABRE&lt;/a&gt; engine to be built.\nAgriculture is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing 60% of food needs with only 2% of the labour force. Two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock, the other to arable crops. The main crops that are grown are &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"barley\"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oat\"&gt;oat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20beet\"&gt;sugar beet&lt;/a&gt;s.

Some experts claim that the earliest concept of a &lt;a href=\"metric%20system\"&gt;metric system&lt;/a&gt; was invented by &lt;a href=\"John%20Wilkins\"&gt;John Wilkins&lt;/a&gt;, the first secretary of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society\"&gt;Royal Society&lt;/a&gt;, in 1668.\nEngland was a leading centre of the &lt;a href=\"Scientific%20Revolution\"&gt;Scientific Revolution&lt;/a&gt; from the 17th century. As the birthplace of the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, England was home to many significant inventors during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Famous English engineers include &lt;a href=\"Isambard%20Kingdom%20Brunel\"&gt;Isambard Kingdom Brunel&lt;/a&gt;, best known for the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Western%20Railway\"&gt;Great Western Railway&lt;/a&gt;, a series of famous &lt;a href=\"steamship\"&gt;steamship&lt;/a&gt;s, and numerous important bridges, hence revolutionising public transport and modern-day engineering. &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Newcomen\"&gt;Thomas Newcomen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Newcomen%20steam%20engine\"&gt;steam engine&lt;/a&gt; helped spawn the Industrial Revolution. \nThe Father of Railways, &lt;a href=\"George%20Stephenson\"&gt;George Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;, built the first public inter-city railway line in the world, the &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20and%20Manchester%20Railway\"&gt;Liverpool and Manchester Railway&lt;/a&gt;, which opened in 1830. With his role in the marketing and manufacturing of the steam engine, and invention of modern coinage, &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Boulton\"&gt;Matthew Boulton&lt;/a&gt; (business partner of &lt;a href=\"James%20Watt\"&gt;James Watt&lt;/a&gt;) is regarded as one of the most influential entrepreneurs in history. The physician &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Jenner\"&gt;Edward Jenner&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"smallpox%20vaccine\"&gt;smallpox vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is said to have \"saved more lives\u00a0... than were lost in all the wars of mankind since the beginning of recorded history.\"\nInventions and discoveries of the English include: the &lt;a href=\"jet%20engine\"&gt;jet engine&lt;/a&gt;, the first industrial &lt;a href=\"spinning%20frame\"&gt;spinning machine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Analytical%20engine\"&gt;the first computer&lt;/a&gt; and the first &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Baby\"&gt;modern computer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Wide%20Web\"&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"HTML\"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;, the first successful human &lt;a href=\"blood%20transfusion\"&gt;blood transfusion&lt;/a&gt;, the motorised &lt;a href=\"vacuum%20cleaner\"&gt;vacuum cleaner&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"lawn%20mower\"&gt;lawn mower&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"seat%20belt\"&gt;seat belt&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"hovercraft\"&gt;hovercraft&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"electric%20motor\"&gt;electric motor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"steam%20engine\"&gt;steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s, and theories such as the Darwinian theory of &lt;a href=\"evolution\"&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"atomic%20theory\"&gt;atomic theory&lt;/a&gt;. Newton developed the ideas of &lt;a href=\"universal%20gravitation\"&gt;universal gravitation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newtonian%20mechanics\"&gt;Newtonian mechanics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"calculus\"&gt;calculus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Hooke\"&gt;Robert Hooke&lt;/a&gt; his eponymously named &lt;a href=\"Hooke%27s%20law%20of%20elasticity\"&gt;law of elasticity&lt;/a&gt;. Other inventions include the iron plate railway, the &lt;a href=\"thermosiphon\"&gt;thermosiphon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tarmacadam\"&gt;tarmac&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"rubber%20band\"&gt;rubber band&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mousetrap\"&gt;mousetrap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cat%27s%20eye%20%28road%29\"&gt;\"cat's eye\"&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"raised%20pavement%20marker\"&gt;road marker&lt;/a&gt;, joint development of the &lt;a href=\"light%20bulb\"&gt;light bulb&lt;/a&gt;, steam &lt;a href=\"locomotive\"&gt;locomotive&lt;/a&gt;s, the modern &lt;a href=\"seed%20drill\"&gt;seed drill&lt;/a&gt; and many modern techniques and technologies used in &lt;a href=\"precision%20engineering\"&gt;precision engineering&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society\"&gt;Royal Society&lt;/a&gt;, formally &lt;a href=\"The%20Royal%20Society%20of%20London%20for%20Improving%20Natural%20Knowledge\"&gt;The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, is a &lt;a href=\"learned%20society\"&gt;learned society&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s national &lt;a href=\"academy%20of%20sciences\"&gt;academy of sciences&lt;/a&gt;. Founded on 28 November 1660, it was granted a &lt;a href=\"royal%20charter\"&gt;royal charter&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;King Charles II&lt;/a&gt; as \"The Royal Society\". It is the oldest national scientific institution in the world. The society fulfils a number of roles: promoting science and its benefits, recognising excellence in science, supporting outstanding science, providing scientific advice for policy, fostering international and global co-operation, education and public engagement.\nThe Royal Society started from groups of physicians and &lt;a href=\"Natural%20philosopher\"&gt;natural philosophers&lt;/a&gt;, meeting at a variety of locations, including &lt;a href=\"Gresham%20College\"&gt;Gresham College&lt;/a&gt; in London. They were influenced by the \"&lt;a href=\"Scientific%20method\"&gt;new science&lt;/a&gt;\", as promoted by &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Bacon\"&gt;Francis Bacon&lt;/a&gt; in his \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Atlantis\"&gt;New Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;\", from approximately 1645 onwards. A group known as \"The Philosophical Society of Oxford\" was run under a set of rules still retained by the &lt;a href=\"Bodleian%20Library\"&gt;Bodleian Library&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"English%20Restoration\"&gt;English Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, there were regular meetings at Gresham College. It is widely held that these groups were the inspiration for the foundation of the Royal Society. \nScientific research and development remains important in the &lt;a href=\"universities%20of%20England\"&gt;universities of England&lt;/a&gt;, with many establishing &lt;a href=\"science%20park\"&gt;science park&lt;/a&gt;s to facilitate production and co-operation with industry. Between 2004 and 2008 the United Kingdom produced 7 per cent of the world's scientific research papers and had an 8 per cent share of scientific citations, the third and second-highest in the world (after the United States and China, respectively). Scientific journals produced in the United Kingdom include \"&lt;a href=\"Nature%20%28journal%29\"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"BMJ\"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lancet\"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTransport.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Department%20for%20Transport\"&gt;Department for Transport&lt;/a&gt; is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. The department is run by the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Transport\"&gt;Secretary of State for Transport&lt;/a&gt;. \nEngland has a dense and modern transportation infrastructure. There are many &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20motorways%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;motorways in England&lt;/a&gt;, and many other trunk roads, such as the &lt;a href=\"A1%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;A1 Great North Road&lt;/a&gt;, which runs through eastern England from London to Newcastle (much of this section is motorway) and onward to the Scottish border. The longest motorway in England is the &lt;a href=\"M6%20motorway\"&gt;M6&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Rugby%2C%20Warwickshire\"&gt;Rugby&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"North%20West%20England\"&gt;North West&lt;/a&gt; up to the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Scottish%20border\"&gt;Anglo-Scottish border&lt;/a&gt;, a distance of . Other major routes include: the &lt;a href=\"M1%20motorway\"&gt;M1&lt;/a&gt; from London to Leeds, the &lt;a href=\"M25%20motorway\"&gt;M25&lt;/a&gt; which encircles London, the &lt;a href=\"M60%20motorway%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;M60&lt;/a&gt; which encircles Manchester, the &lt;a href=\"M4%20motorway\"&gt;M4&lt;/a&gt; from London to South Wales, the &lt;a href=\"M62%20motorway\"&gt;M62&lt;/a&gt; from Liverpool via Manchester to East Yorkshire, and the &lt;a href=\"M5%20motorway\"&gt;M5&lt;/a&gt; from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West.\nBus transport across the country is widespread; major companies include &lt;a href=\"Arriva%20UK%20Bus\"&gt;Arriva&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FirstGroup\"&gt;FirstGroup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Go-Ahead%20Group\"&gt;Go-Ahead Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"National%20Express\"&gt;National Express&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rotala\"&gt;Rotala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stagecoach%20Group\"&gt;Stagecoach Group&lt;/a&gt;. The red &lt;a href=\"double-decker%20bus\"&gt;double-decker bus&lt;/a&gt;es in London have become a symbol of England. \n&lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route\"&gt;National Cycle Route&lt;/a&gt; offers cycling routes nationally. There is a &lt;a href=\"rapid%20transit\"&gt;rapid transit&lt;/a&gt; network in two English cities: the &lt;a href=\"London%20Underground\"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt;; and the &lt;a href=\"Tyne%20and%20Wear%20Metro\"&gt;Tyne and Wear Metro&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne\"&gt;Newcastle upon Tyne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gateshead\"&gt;Gateshead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunderland\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;. There are several tram networks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Blackpool%20tramway\"&gt;Blackpool tramway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Metrolink\"&gt;Manchester Metrolink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Supertram\"&gt;Sheffield Supertram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20Metro\"&gt;West Midlands Metro&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Tramlink\"&gt;Tramlink&lt;/a&gt; system centred on Croydon in South London.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20British%20Railways\"&gt;Great British Railways&lt;/a&gt; is a planned &lt;a href=\"State%20ownership\"&gt;state-owned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"public%20body\"&gt;public body&lt;/a&gt; that will oversee &lt;a href=\"rail%20transport%20in%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;rail transport in Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; from 2023. The &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Rail%20and%20Road\"&gt;Office of Rail and Road&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for the economic and safety regulation of England's railways.\n&lt;a href=\"Rail%20transport%20in%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Rail transport in England&lt;/a&gt; is the oldest in the world: passenger railways originated in England in 1825. Much of Britain's of rail network lies in England, covering the country fairly extensively, although a high proportion of railway lines were closed in the second half of the 20th century. There are plans to reopen lines such as the &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20Line\"&gt;Varsity Line&lt;/a&gt; between Oxford and Cambridge. These lines are mostly standard gauge (&lt;a href=\"single%20track%20%28rail%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"double%20track\"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"quadruple%20track\"&gt;quadruple track&lt;/a&gt;) though there are also a few &lt;a href=\"British%20narrow%20gauge%20railways\"&gt;narrow gauge lines&lt;/a&gt;. There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the &lt;a href=\"Channel%20Tunnel\"&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, which was completed in 1994.\n&lt;a href=\"Crossrail\"&gt;Crossrail&lt;/a&gt;, under construction in London, is Europe's largest construction project with a \u00a315 billion projected cost. &lt;a href=\"High%20Speed%202\"&gt;High Speed 2&lt;/a&gt;, a new high-speed north\u2013south railway line, projected in 2015 to cost \u00a356 billion is to start being built in 2020.\nEngland has extensive domestic and international aviation links. The largest airport is &lt;a href=\"Heathrow%20Airport\"&gt;Heathrow&lt;/a&gt;, which is the &lt;a href=\"World%27s%20busiest%20airports%20by%20international%20passenger%20traffic\"&gt;world's busiest airport measured by number of international passengers&lt;/a&gt;. Other large airports include &lt;a href=\"Gatwick%20Airport\"&gt;Gatwick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Airport\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stansted%20Airport\"&gt;Stansted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luton%20Airport\"&gt;Luton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20Airport\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy sea there is ferry transport, both local and international, including from Liverpool to Ireland and the Isle of Man, and Hull to the Netherlands and Belgium. There are around of navigable waterways in England, half of which is owned by the &lt;a href=\"Canal%20%26amp%3B%20River%20Trust\"&gt;Canal &amp; River Trust&lt;/a&gt;, however, water transport is very limited. The &lt;a href=\"River%20Thames\"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt; is the major waterway in England, with imports and exports focused at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Tilbury\"&gt;Port of Tilbury&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Thames%20Estuary\"&gt;Thames Estuary&lt;/a&gt;, one of the United Kingdom's three major ports.\nEnergy.\n&lt;a href=\"Energy\"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt; use in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; stood at 2,249 &lt;a href=\"TWh\"&gt;TWh&lt;/a&gt; (193.4 million &lt;a href=\"Tonne%20of%20oil%20equivalent\"&gt;tonnes of oil equivalent&lt;/a&gt;) in 2014. This equates to &lt;a href=\"energy%20consumption\"&gt;energy consumption&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"per%20capita\"&gt;per capita&lt;/a&gt;\" of 34.82 MWh (3.00 tonnes of oil equivalent) compared to a 2010 world average of 21.54 &lt;a href=\"MWh\"&gt;MWh&lt;/a&gt; (1.85 &lt;a href=\"tonne%20of%20oil%20equivalent\"&gt;tonnes of oil equivalent&lt;/a&gt;). Demand for electricity in 2014 was 34.42&lt;a href=\"Watt\"&gt;GW&lt;/a&gt; on average (301.7TWh over the year) coming from a total electricity generation of 335.0&lt;a href=\"Kilowatt%20hour\"&gt;TWh&lt;/a&gt;. \nSuccessive &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;UK governments&lt;/a&gt; have outlined numerous commitments to reduce &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; emissions. Notably, the UK is &lt;a href=\"Wind%20power%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy&lt;/a&gt;, and wind power production is its fastest growing supply. Wind power contributed 15% of UK electricity generation in 2017. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Climate%20Change%20Act%202008\"&gt;Climate Change Act 2008&lt;/a&gt; was passed in &lt;a href=\"Parliament\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; with an overwhelming majority across political parties. It sets out emission reduction targets that the UK must comply with legally. It represents the first global legally binding climate change mitigation target set by a country. &lt;a href=\"Energy%20policy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;UK government energy policy&lt;/a&gt; aims to play a key role in limiting &lt;a href=\"greenhouse%20gas%20emissions\"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;, whilst meeting energy demand. Shifting availabilities of resources and development of technologies also change the country's &lt;a href=\"energy%20mix\"&gt;energy mix&lt;/a&gt; through changes in costs.\nThe current energy policy is the responsibility of the &lt;a href=\"Department%20for%20Business%2C%20Energy%20and%20Industrial%20Strategy\"&gt;Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Business%2C%20Energy%20and%20Industrial%20Strategy\"&gt;Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.

A law has been passed that &lt;a href=\"Greenhouse%20gas%20emissions\"&gt;UK greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; will be &lt;a href=\"net%20zero\"&gt;net zero&lt;/a&gt; by 2050.\nTourism.\n&lt;a href=\"English%20Heritage\"&gt;English Heritage&lt;/a&gt; is a governmental body with a broad remit of managing the historic sites, artefacts and environments of England. It is currently sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Department%20for%20Culture%2C%20Media%20and%20Sport\"&gt;Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty&lt;/a&gt; is a charity which also maintains multiple sites. Of the 25 United Kingdom &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Sites&lt;/a&gt;, 17 are in England. \nSome of the best known of these include &lt;a href=\"Stonehenge%2C%20Avebury%20and%20Associated%20Sites\"&gt;Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20London\"&gt;Tower of London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jurassic%20Coast\"&gt;Jurassic Coast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Westminster\"&gt;Palace of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Baths%20%28Bath%29\"&gt;Roman Baths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bath%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;City of Bath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saltaire\"&gt;Saltaire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironbridge%20Gorge\"&gt;Ironbridge Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Studley%20Royal%20Park\"&gt;Studley Royal Park&lt;/a&gt; and more recently the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District\"&gt;English Lake District&lt;/a&gt;. The northernmost point of the Roman Empire, &lt;a href=\"Hadrian%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Hadrian's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, is the largest Roman artefact anywhere: it runs for a total of 73 miles in northern England.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Digital%2C%20Culture%2C%20Media%20and%20Sport\"&gt;Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/a&gt; has overall responsibility for tourism, arts and culture, cultural property, heritage and historic environments, libraries, and museums and galleries. The &lt;a href=\"Parliamentary%20Under%20Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Arts%2C%20Heritage%20and%20Tourism\"&gt;Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Arts, Heritage and Tourism&lt;/a&gt; is the minister with responsibility over tourism in England. \nA &lt;a href=\"blue%20plaque\"&gt;blue plaque&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest &lt;a href=\"historical%20marker\"&gt;historical marker&lt;/a&gt; scheme in the world, is a permanent sign installed in a public place in England to commemorate a link between that location and a famous person or event. The scheme was the brainchild of politician &lt;a href=\"William%20Ewart%20%28British%20politician%29\"&gt;William Ewart&lt;/a&gt; in 1863 and was initiated in 1866. It was formally established by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Royal Society of Arts&lt;/a&gt; in 1867, and since 1986 has been run by &lt;a href=\"English%20Heritage\"&gt;English Heritage&lt;/a&gt;. In 2011 there were around 1,600 museums in England. Entry to most state-supported museums and galleries is free unlike in other countries. \n&lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; is one of the world's most visited cities, regularly taking the top five most visited cities in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. It is largely considered a global centre of finance, arts and culture.\nHealthcare.\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29\"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt; (NHS), is the publicly funded &lt;a href=\"healthcare%20system\"&gt;healthcare system&lt;/a&gt; responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Health%20Service%20Act%201946\"&gt;National Health Service Act 1946&lt;/a&gt;. It was based on the findings of the &lt;a href=\"Beveridge%20Report\"&gt;Beveridge Report&lt;/a&gt;, prepared by economist and social reformer &lt;a href=\"William%20Beveridge\"&gt;William Beveridge&lt;/a&gt;. The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including &lt;a href=\"National%20Insurance\"&gt;National Insurance&lt;/a&gt; payments, and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.\nThe government department responsible for the NHS is the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Health%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;, headed by the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Health\"&gt;Secretary of State for Health&lt;/a&gt;, who sits in the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British Cabinet&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the expenditure of the Department of Health is spent on the NHS\u2014\u00a398.6\u00a0billion was spent in 2008\u20132009. In recent years the private sector has been increasingly used to provide more NHS services despite opposition by doctors and trade unions.\nWhen purchasing drugs, the NHS has significant market power that, based on its own assessment of the fair value of the drugs, influences the global price, typically keeping prices lower. Several other countries either copy the UK's model or directly rely on Britain's assessments for their own decisions on state-financed drug reimbursements. Regulatory bodies such as the &lt;a href=\"General%20Medical%20Council\"&gt;General Medical Council&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nursing%20and%20Midwifery%20Council\"&gt;Nursing and Midwifery Council&lt;/a&gt; are organised on a UK-wide basis, as are non-governmental bodies such as the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20College\"&gt;Royal College&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe average &lt;a href=\"life%20expectancy\"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; of people in England is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four &lt;a href=\"countries%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;countries of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The South of England has a higher life expectancy than the North; however, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991\u20131993 and 2012\u20132014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.\nDemography.\nPopulation.\nWith over 53\u00a0million inhabitants, England is by far the most populous country of the United Kingdom, accounting for 84% of the combined total. England taken as a unit and measured against international states would be the 25th largest &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20population%20in%202005\"&gt;country by population&lt;/a&gt; in the world.\nThe &lt;a href=\"English%20people\"&gt;English people&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"British%20people\"&gt;British people&lt;/a&gt;. Some genetic evidence suggests that 75\u201395% descend in the paternal line from prehistoric settlers who originally came from the &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a 5% contribution from &lt;a href=\"Angles\"&gt;Angles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saxons\"&gt;Saxons&lt;/a&gt;, and a significant Scandinavian (&lt;a href=\"Vikings\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt;) element. However, other geneticists place the &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20peoples\"&gt;Germanic&lt;/a&gt; estimate up to half. Over time, various cultures have been influential: &lt;a href=\"Prehistoric%20Britain\"&gt;Prehistoric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Britons%20%28historical%29\"&gt;Brythonic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Viking\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt; (North Germanic), &lt;a href=\"Gaels\"&gt;Gaelic&lt;/a&gt; cultures, as well as a large influence from &lt;a href=\"Normans\"&gt;Normans&lt;/a&gt;. There is an English diaspora in former parts of the British Empire; especially the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. Since the late 1990s, many English people &lt;a href=\"British%20migration%20to%20Spain\"&gt;have migrated&lt;/a&gt; to Spain.\nIn 1086, when the \"&lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt;\" was compiled, England had a population of two million. About 10% lived in urban areas. By 1801, the population was 8.3\u00a0million, and by 1901 30.5\u00a0million. Due in particular to the economic prosperity of &lt;a href=\"South%20East%20England\"&gt;South East England&lt;/a&gt;, it has received many economic migrants from the other parts of the United Kingdom. There has been &lt;a href=\"Irish%20migration%20to%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;significant Irish migration&lt;/a&gt;. The proportion of ethnically European residents totals at 87.50%, including &lt;a href=\"British%20Germans\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Polish%20British\"&gt;Poles&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther people from much further afield in the former British colonies have arrived since the 1950s: in particular, 6% of people living in England have family origins in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20subcontinent\"&gt;Indian subcontinent&lt;/a&gt;, mostly &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;. About 0.7% of people are Chinese. 2.90% of the population are black, from Africa and the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;, especially former British colonies. In 2007, 22% of primary school children in England were from &lt;a href=\"minority%20group\"&gt;ethnic minority&lt;/a&gt; families, and in 2011 that figure was 26.5%. About half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 was due to immigration. Debate over immigration is politically prominent; 80% of respondents in a 2009 &lt;a href=\"Home%20Office\"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt; poll wanted to cap it. The &lt;a href=\"Office%20for%20National%20Statistics\"&gt;ONS&lt;/a&gt; has projected that the population will grow by nine million between 2014 and 2039.\nEngland contains one indigenous national minority, the &lt;a href=\"Cornish%20people\"&gt;Cornish people&lt;/a&gt;, recognised by the UK government under the &lt;a href=\"Framework%20Convention%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20National%20Minorities\"&gt;Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.\nLanguage.\nAs its name suggests, the &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English language&lt;/a&gt;, today spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world, originated as the language of England, where it remains the principal tongue spoken by 98% of the population. It is an &lt;a href=\"Indo-European%20languages\"&gt;Indo-European&lt;/a&gt; language in the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Frisian%20languages\"&gt;Anglo-Frisian&lt;/a&gt; branch of the &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20languages\"&gt;Germanic&lt;/a&gt; family. After the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20conquest\"&gt;Norman conquest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; language, brought to Britain by the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxons\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon settlers&lt;/a&gt;, was confined to the &lt;a href=\"Working%20class\"&gt;lower social classes&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Norman%20language\"&gt;Norman French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; were used by the aristocracy.\nBy the 15th century, English was back in fashion among all classes, though much changed; the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20English\"&gt;Middle English&lt;/a&gt; form showed many signs of French influence, both in vocabulary and spelling. During the &lt;a href=\"English%20Renaissance\"&gt;English Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. &lt;a href=\"Modern%20English\"&gt;Modern English&lt;/a&gt; has extended this custom of flexibility when it comes to incorporating words from different languages. Thanks in large part to the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the English language is the world's unofficial \"&lt;a href=\"lingua%20franca\"&gt;lingua franca&lt;/a&gt;\".\n&lt;a href=\"English%20as%20a%20second%20or%20foreign%20language\"&gt;English language learning and teaching&lt;/a&gt; is an important &lt;a href=\"Economics\"&gt;economic activity&lt;/a&gt;, and includes &lt;a href=\"language%20schools\"&gt;language schooling&lt;/a&gt;, tourism spending, and publishing. There is no &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20legislation\"&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; mandating an &lt;a href=\"official%20language\"&gt;official language&lt;/a&gt; for England, but English is the only language used for official business. Despite the country's relatively small size, there are many distinct &lt;a href=\"Regional%20accents%20of%20English%20speakers%23England\"&gt;regional accents&lt;/a&gt;, and individuals with particularly strong accents may not be easily understood everywhere in the country.\nAs well as English, England has two other &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20language\"&gt;indigenous language&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Cornish%20language\"&gt;Cornish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt;. Cornish died out as a community language in the 18th century but is being revived, and is now protected under the &lt;a href=\"European%20Charter%20for%20Regional%20or%20Minority%20Languages\"&gt;European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages&lt;/a&gt;. It is spoken by 0.1% of people in &lt;a href=\"Cornwall\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;, and is taught to some degree in several primary and secondary schools.\nWhen the modern border between Wales and England was established by the &lt;a href=\"Laws%20in%20Wales%20Acts%201535%20and%201542\"&gt;Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542&lt;/a&gt;, many Welsh-speaking communities found themselves on the English side of the border. Welsh was spoken in &lt;a href=\"Archenfield\"&gt;Archenfield&lt;/a&gt; in Herefordshire into the nineteenth century, and by natives of parts of western &lt;a href=\"Shropshire\"&gt;Shropshire&lt;/a&gt; until the middle of the twentieth century if not later.\n&lt;a href=\"State%20school\"&gt;State school&lt;/a&gt;s teach students a &lt;a href=\"second%20language\"&gt;second language&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"third%20language\"&gt;third language&lt;/a&gt; from the ages of seven, most commonly French, Spanish or German. It was reported in 2007 that around 800,000 school students spoke a &lt;a href=\"foreign%20language\"&gt;foreign language&lt;/a&gt; at home as a result of immigration among their family, the most common languages being &lt;a href=\"Punjabi%20language\"&gt;Punjabi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt;. However, following the 2011 census data released by the &lt;a href=\"Office%20for%20National%20Statistics\"&gt;Office for National Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, figures now show that Polish is the main language spoken in England after English.\nReligion.\nIn the 2011 census, 59.4% of the population of England specified their religion as Christian, 24.7% answered that they had no religion, 5% specified that they were &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;, while 3.7% of the population belongs to other religions and 7.2% did not give an answer. Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England, as it has been since the Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier in Gaelic and Roman times. This &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Church\"&gt;Celtic Church&lt;/a&gt; was gradually joined to the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; hierarchy following the 6th-century &lt;a href=\"Gregorian%20mission\"&gt;Gregorian mission&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Augustine%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;St\u00a0Augustine&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"established%20church\"&gt;established church&lt;/a&gt; of England is the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt;, which left communion with &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20City\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; in the 1530s when &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry\u00a0VIII&lt;/a&gt; was unable to annul his marriage to &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;the aunt&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;king of Spain&lt;/a&gt;. The church regards itself as both Catholic and &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are &lt;a href=\"High%20Church\"&gt;High Church&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Low%20Church\"&gt;Low Church&lt;/a&gt; traditions and some Anglicans regard themselves as &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Catholics\"&gt;Anglo-Catholics&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href=\"Tractarian%20movement\"&gt;Tractarian movement&lt;/a&gt;. The monarch of the United Kingdom is the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Governor%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Supreme Governor of the Church of England&lt;/a&gt;, which has around 26\u00a0million baptised members (of whom the vast majority are not regular churchgoers). It forms part of the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Communion\"&gt;Anglican Communion&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; acting as its symbolic worldwide head. Many &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cathedrals%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;cathedrals&lt;/a&gt; and parish churches are historic buildings of significant architectural importance, such as &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"York%20Minster\"&gt;York Minster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durham%20Cathedral\"&gt;Durham Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Salisbury%20Cathedral\"&gt;Salisbury Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 2nd-largest Christian practice is the &lt;a href=\"Latin%20Rite\"&gt;Latin Rite&lt;/a&gt; of the Catholic Church. Since its reintroduction after the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Emancipation\"&gt;Catholic Emancipation&lt;/a&gt;, the Church has organised ecclesiastically on an &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;England and Wales&lt;/a&gt; basis where there are 4.5\u00a0million members (most of whom are English). There has been one Pope from England to date, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Adrian%20IV\"&gt;Adrian IV&lt;/a&gt;; while saints &lt;a href=\"Bede\"&gt;Bede&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anselm%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Anselm&lt;/a&gt; are regarded as &lt;a href=\"Doctors%20of%20the%20Church\"&gt;Doctors of the Church&lt;/a&gt;.\nA form of &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestantism&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Methodist%20Church%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Methodism&lt;/a&gt; is the third largest Christian practice and grew out of Anglicanism through &lt;a href=\"John%20Wesley\"&gt;John Wesley&lt;/a&gt;. It gained popularity in the &lt;a href=\"mill%20town\"&gt;mill town&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, and amongst tin miners in &lt;a href=\"Cornwall\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;. There are other &lt;a href=\"Nonconformist%20%28Protestantism%29\"&gt;non-conformist&lt;/a&gt; minorities, such as &lt;a href=\"Baptists\"&gt;Baptists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quakers\"&gt;Quakers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Congregational%20church\"&gt;Congregationalists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unitarianism\"&gt;Unitarians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Salvation%20Army\"&gt;The Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe patron saint of England is &lt;a href=\"Saint%20George\"&gt;Saint George&lt;/a&gt;; his symbolic cross is included in the flag of England, as well as in the Union Flag as part of a combination. There are many other English and associated saints; some of the best-known are: &lt;a href=\"Cuthbert\"&gt;Cuthbert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20the%20Martyr\"&gt;Edmund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alban\"&gt;Alban&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wilfrid\"&gt;Wilfrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aidan%20of%20Lindisfarne\"&gt;Aidan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20the%20Confessor\"&gt;Edward the Confessor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Fisher\"&gt;John Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20More\"&gt;Thomas More&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petroc\"&gt;Petroc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Piran\"&gt;Piran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Clitherow\"&gt;Margaret Clitherow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Becket\"&gt;Thomas Becket&lt;/a&gt;. There are non-Christian religions practised. &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; have a history of a small minority on the island since 1070. They were expelled from England in 1290 following the &lt;a href=\"Edict%20of%20Expulsion\"&gt;Edict of Expulsion&lt;/a&gt;, only to be allowed back in 1656.\nEspecially since the 1950s, religions from the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;former British colonies&lt;/a&gt; have grown in numbers, due to immigration. &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; is the most common of these, now accounting for around 5% of the population in England. &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sikhism\"&gt;Sikhism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; are next in number, adding up to 2.8% combined, introduced from India and &lt;a href=\"South%20East%20Asia\"&gt;South East Asia&lt;/a&gt;.\nA small minority of the population practise ancient &lt;a href=\"Pagan%20religion\"&gt;Pagan religion&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Neopaganism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Neopaganism in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; is primarily represented by &lt;a href=\"Wicca\"&gt;Wicca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Contemporary%20Witchcraft\"&gt;Witchcraft religions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neo-Druidry\"&gt;Druidry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20neopaganism\"&gt;Heathenry&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011\"&gt;2011 UK Census&lt;/a&gt;, there are roughly 53,172 people who identify as Pagan in England, and 3,448 in &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, including 11,026 &lt;a href=\"Wicca\"&gt;Wicca&lt;/a&gt;ns in England and 740 in Wales.\n24.7% of people in England declared &lt;a href=\"Irreligion\"&gt;no religion&lt;/a&gt; in 2011, compared with 14.6% in 2001. These figures are slightly lower than the combined figures for England and Wales as Wales has a higher level of irreligion than England. &lt;a href=\"Norwich\"&gt;Norwich&lt;/a&gt; had the highest such proportion at 42.5%, followed closely by &lt;a href=\"Brighton%20and%20Hove\"&gt;Brighton and Hove&lt;/a&gt; at 42.4%.\nEducation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Department%20for%20Education\"&gt;Department for Education&lt;/a&gt; is the government department responsible for issues affecting people in England up to the age of 19, including education. State-run and state-funded schools are attended by approximately 93% of English schoolchildren. Education is the responsibility of the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Education\"&gt;Secretary of State for Education&lt;/a&gt;.\nChildren who are between the ages of 3 and 5 attend nursery or an &lt;a href=\"Early%20Years%20Foundation%20Stage\"&gt;Early Years Foundation Stage&lt;/a&gt; reception unit within a primary school. Children between the ages of 5 and 11 attend primary school, and secondary school is attended by those aged between 11 and 16. State-funded schools are obliged by law to teach the &lt;a href=\"National%20Curriculum%20for%20England\"&gt;National Curriculum&lt;/a&gt;; basic areas of learning include English literature, English language, mathematics, science, art &amp; design, citizenship, history, geography, religious education, design &amp; technology, computing, ancient &amp; modern languages, music, and physical education.\nMore than 90% of English schools require students to wear uniforms. School uniforms are defined by individual schools, within the constraint that uniform regulations must not discriminate on the grounds of sex, race, disability, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, religion or belief. Schools may choose to permit trousers for girls or religious dress.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Programme%20for%20International%20Student%20Assessment\"&gt;Programme for International Student Assessment&lt;/a&gt; coordinated by the &lt;a href=\"OECD\"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt; currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds as 13th in the world in reading literacy, mathematics, and science with the average British student scoring 503.7, compared with the OECD average of 493, ahead of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and most of &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough most English secondary schools are &lt;a href=\"comprehensive%20school\"&gt;comprehensive&lt;/a&gt;, there are selective intake &lt;a href=\"grammar%20school\"&gt;grammar school&lt;/a&gt;s to which entrance is subject to passing the &lt;a href=\"eleven-plus\"&gt;eleven-plus&lt;/a&gt; exam. Around 7.2 per cent of English schoolchildren attend &lt;a href=\"Independent%20school%20%28UK%29\"&gt;private schools&lt;/a&gt;, which are funded by private sources. Standards in state schools are monitored by the &lt;a href=\"Office%20for%20Standards%20in%20Education\"&gt;Office for Standards in Education&lt;/a&gt;, and in private schools by the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Schools%20Inspectorate\"&gt;Independent Schools Inspectorate&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing compulsory education, students take &lt;a href=\"General%20Certificate%20of%20Secondary%20Education\"&gt;GCSE&lt;/a&gt; examinations. Students may then opt to continue into &lt;a href=\"further%20education\"&gt;further education&lt;/a&gt; for two years. &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20further%20education%20colleges%20in%20England\"&gt;Further education colleges&lt;/a&gt; (particularly &lt;a href=\"sixth%20form%20colleges\"&gt;sixth form colleges&lt;/a&gt;) often form part of a secondary school site. &lt;a href=\"A-level\"&gt;A-level&lt;/a&gt; examinations are sat by a large number of further education students, and often form the basis of an application to university. Further education (FE) covers a wide curriculum of study and &lt;a href=\"apprenticeship\"&gt;apprenticeship&lt;/a&gt;s, including &lt;a href=\"T%20Level\"&gt;T-levels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"BTEC%20Extended%20Diploma\"&gt;BTEC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NVQ\"&gt;NVQ&lt;/a&gt; and others. &lt;a href=\"Tertiary%20college\"&gt;Tertiary college&lt;/a&gt;s provide both academic and vocational courses.\nHigher education students normally attend university from age 18 onwards, where they study for an &lt;a href=\"academic%20degree\"&gt;academic degree&lt;/a&gt;. There are over 90\u00a0universities in England, all but one of which are &lt;a href=\"Public%20university\"&gt;public institutions&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Department%20for%20Business%2C%20Innovation%20and%20Skills\"&gt;Department for Business, Innovation and Skills&lt;/a&gt; is the government department responsible for higher education in England. Students are generally entitled to &lt;a href=\"student%20loan\"&gt;student loan&lt;/a&gt;s to cover the cost of &lt;a href=\"tuition%20fees\"&gt;tuition fees&lt;/a&gt; and living costs. The first degree offered to undergraduates is the &lt;a href=\"bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;bachelor's degree&lt;/a&gt;, which usually takes three years to complete. Students are then able to work towards a postgraduate degree, which usually takes one year, or towards a doctorate, which takes three or more years.\n&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20universities%20in%20England\"&gt;England's universities&lt;/a&gt; include some of the highest-ranked universities in the world; &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20College%20London\"&gt;Imperial College London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"University%20College%20London\"&gt;University College London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20College%20London\"&gt;King's College London&lt;/a&gt; are all ranked in the global top 30 in the 2018 \"&lt;a href=\"QS%20World%20University%20Rankings\"&gt;QS World University Rankings&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"London%20School%20of%20Economics\"&gt;London School of Economics&lt;/a&gt; has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research. The &lt;a href=\"London%20Business%20School\"&gt;London Business School&lt;/a&gt; is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2010 its MBA programme was ranked best in the world by the \"&lt;a href=\"Financial%20Times\"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Academic%20degree\"&gt;Academic degree&lt;/a&gt;s in England are usually split into classes: first class (1st), upper second class (2:1), lower second class (2:2), third (3rd), and unclassified.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20King%27s%20School%2C%20Canterbury\"&gt;The King's School, Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20School%2C%20Rochester\"&gt;King's School, Rochester&lt;/a&gt; are the oldest schools in the English-speaking world. Many of England's most well-known schools, such as &lt;a href=\"Winchester%20College\"&gt;Winchester College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St%20Paul%27s%20School%20%28London%29\"&gt;St Paul's School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harrow%20School\"&gt;Harrow School&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20School\"&gt;Rugby School&lt;/a&gt; are fee-paying institutions.\nCulture.\nArchitecture.\nMany ancient &lt;a href=\"standing%20stone\"&gt;standing stone&lt;/a&gt; monuments were erected during the prehistoric period; amongst the best known are &lt;a href=\"Stonehenge\"&gt;Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devil%27s%20Arrows\"&gt;Devil's Arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rudston%20Monolith\"&gt;Rudston Monolith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Castlerigg%20stone%20circle\"&gt;Castlerigg&lt;/a&gt;. With the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Roman%20architecture\"&gt;Ancient Roman architecture&lt;/a&gt; there was a development of &lt;a href=\"basilicas\"&gt;basilicas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20baths\"&gt;baths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"amphitheaters\"&gt;amphitheaters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"triumphal%20arch\"&gt;triumphal arch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20temple\"&gt;Roman temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20road\"&gt;Roman road&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20fort\"&gt;Roman fort&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stockade\"&gt;stockade&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"aqueduct%20%28bridge%29\"&gt;aqueducts&lt;/a&gt;. It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans. Perhaps the best-known example is &lt;a href=\"Hadrian%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Hadrian's Wall&lt;/a&gt; stretching right across northern England. Another well-preserved example is the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Baths%20%28Bath%29\"&gt;Roman Baths&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Bath%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Bath, Somerset&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20architecture\"&gt;Early Medieval architecture's&lt;/a&gt; secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with &lt;a href=\"thatch\"&gt;thatch&lt;/a&gt; for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of &lt;a href=\"Early%20Christian%20Ireland\"&gt;Hiberno&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Germanic%20Christianity\"&gt;Saxon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monasticism\"&gt;monasticism&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Early%20Christian%20art%20and%20architecture\"&gt;Early Christian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"basilica\"&gt;basilica&lt;/a&gt; and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various &lt;a href=\"Castles%20in%20England\"&gt;Castles in England&lt;/a&gt; were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20London\"&gt;Tower of London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warwick%20Castle\"&gt;Warwick Castle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durham%20Castle\"&gt;Durham Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Castle\"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout the Plantagenet era, an &lt;a href=\"English%20Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;English Gothic architecture&lt;/a&gt; flourished, with prime examples including the &lt;a href=\"Architecture%20of%20the%20medieval%20cathedrals%20of%20England\"&gt;medieval cathedrals&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Canterbury%20Cathedral\"&gt;Canterbury Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"York%20Minster\"&gt;York Minster&lt;/a&gt;. Expanding on the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20architecture\"&gt;Norman base&lt;/a&gt; there was also &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"palace\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20historic%20houses%20in%20England\"&gt;great houses&lt;/a&gt;, universities and &lt;a href=\"parish%20church\"&gt;parish church&lt;/a&gt;es. Medieval architecture was completed with the 16th-century &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20architecture\"&gt;Tudor style&lt;/a&gt;; the four-centred arch, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20arch\"&gt;Tudor arch&lt;/a&gt;, was a defining feature as were &lt;a href=\"wattle%20and%20daub\"&gt;wattle and daub&lt;/a&gt; houses domestically. In the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; a form of architecture echoing classical antiquity synthesised with Christianity appeared, the &lt;a href=\"English%20Baroque\"&gt;English Baroque&lt;/a&gt; style of architect &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Wren\"&gt;Christopher Wren&lt;/a&gt; being particularly championed.\n&lt;a href=\"Georgian%20architecture\"&gt;Georgian architecture&lt;/a&gt; followed in a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Crescent\"&gt;Royal Crescent&lt;/a&gt; at Bath is one of the best examples of this. With the emergence of &lt;a href=\"romanticism\"&gt;romanticism&lt;/a&gt; during Victorian period, a &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20Revival\"&gt;Gothic Revival&lt;/a&gt; was launched. In addition to this, around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Crystal%20Palace\"&gt;The Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Since the 1930s various &lt;a href=\"modernist%20architecture\"&gt;modernist&lt;/a&gt; forms have appeared whose reception is often controversial, though traditionalist resistance movements continue with support in influential places.\nGardens.\nLandscape gardening, as developed by &lt;a href=\"Capability%20Brown\"&gt;Capability Brown&lt;/a&gt;, set an international trend for the &lt;a href=\"English%20garden\"&gt;English garden&lt;/a&gt;. Gardening, and visiting gardens, are regarded as typically English pursuits. The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. At large country houses, the English garden usually included lakes, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt; ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape.\nBy the end of the 18th century, the English garden was being imitated by the &lt;a href=\"French%20landscape%20garden\"&gt;French landscape garden&lt;/a&gt;, and as far away as St. Petersburg, Russia, in &lt;a href=\"Pavlovsk%2C%20Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Pavlovsk&lt;/a&gt;, the gardens of the future &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Paul\"&gt;Emperor Paul&lt;/a&gt;. It also had a major influence on the form of the &lt;a href=\"public%20parks\"&gt;public parks&lt;/a&gt; and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century. The English landscape garden was centred on the &lt;a href=\"English%20country%20house\"&gt;English country house&lt;/a&gt; and manor houses. \n&lt;a href=\"English%20Heritage\"&gt;English Heritage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust\"&gt;National Trust&lt;/a&gt; preserve great gardens and landscape parks throughout the country. The &lt;a href=\"RHS%20Chelsea%20Flower%20Show\"&gt;RHS Chelsea Flower Show&lt;/a&gt; is held every year by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Horticultural%20Society\"&gt;Royal Horticultural Society&lt;/a&gt; and is said to be the largest gardening show in the world.\nFolklore.\nEnglish folklore developed over many centuries. Some of the characters and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions. Common folkloric beings include &lt;a href=\"pixie\"&gt;pixie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"giant%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bogeymen\"&gt;bogeymen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dwarf%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. While many legends and folk-customs are thought to be ancient, such as the tales featuring &lt;a href=\"Offa%20of%20Angel\"&gt;Offa of Angel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayland%20the%20Smith\"&gt;Wayland the Smith&lt;/a&gt;, others date from after the Norman invasion. The legends featuring &lt;a href=\"Robin%20Hood\"&gt;Robin Hood&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Merry%20Men\"&gt;Merry Men&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sherwood%20Forest\"&gt;Sherwood&lt;/a&gt;, and their battles with the &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20of%20Nottingham\"&gt;Sheriff of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;, are among the best-known of these.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"High%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;High Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; tales originating from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore and developed into the &lt;a href=\"Arthurian%20myth\"&gt;Arthurian myth&lt;/a&gt;. These were derived from &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Norman%20language\"&gt;Anglo-Norman&lt;/a&gt;, Welsh and French sources, featuring &lt;a href=\"King%20Arthur\"&gt;King Arthur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camelot\"&gt;Camelot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Excalibur\"&gt;Excalibur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merlin\"&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Round%20Table\"&gt;Knights of the Round Table&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Lancelot\"&gt;Lancelot&lt;/a&gt;. These stories are most centrally brought together within &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth\"&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Historia%20Regum%20Britanniae\"&gt;Historia Regum Britanniae&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"History of the Kings of Britain\"). Another early figure from &lt;a href=\"Britons%20%28historic%29\"&gt;British tradition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Cole\"&gt;King Cole&lt;/a&gt;, may have been based on a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and &lt;a href=\"pseudohistory\"&gt;pseudo-histories&lt;/a&gt; make up part of the wider &lt;a href=\"Matter%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Matter of Britain&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of shared British folklore.\nSome folk figures are based on semi or actual historical people whose story has been passed down centuries; &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Godiva\"&gt;Lady Godiva&lt;/a&gt; for instance was said to have ridden naked on horseback through &lt;a href=\"Coventry\"&gt;Coventry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hereward%20the%20Wake\"&gt;Hereward the Wake&lt;/a&gt; was a heroic English figure resisting the Norman invasion, &lt;a href=\"Herne%20the%20Hunter\"&gt;Herne the Hunter&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"equestrianism\"&gt;equestrian&lt;/a&gt; ghost associated with &lt;a href=\"Windsor%2C%20Berkshire\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt; Forest and &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Great%20Park\"&gt;Great Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Shipton\"&gt;Mother Shipton&lt;/a&gt; is the archetypal witch. On 5 November people make bonfires, set off &lt;a href=\"fireworks\"&gt;fireworks&lt;/a&gt; and eat &lt;a href=\"toffee%20apple\"&gt;toffee apple&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Fawkes%20Night\"&gt;commemoration&lt;/a&gt; of the foiling of the &lt;a href=\"Gunpowder%20Plot\"&gt;Gunpowder Plot&lt;/a&gt; centred on &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Fawkes\"&gt;Guy Fawkes&lt;/a&gt;. The chivalrous bandit, such as &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Turpin\"&gt;Dick Turpin&lt;/a&gt;, is a recurring character, while &lt;a href=\"Blackbeard\"&gt;Blackbeard&lt;/a&gt; is the archetypal pirate. There are various national and regional folk activities, participated in to this day, such as &lt;a href=\"Morris%20dancing\"&gt;Morris dancing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maypole%20dance\"&gt;Maypole dancing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rapper%20sword\"&gt;Rapper sword&lt;/a&gt; in the North East, &lt;a href=\"Long%20Sword%20dance\"&gt;Long Sword dance&lt;/a&gt; in Yorkshire, &lt;a href=\"Mummers%20Play\"&gt;Mummers Play&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bottle-kicking\"&gt;bottle-kicking&lt;/a&gt; in Leicestershire, and &lt;a href=\"Cooper%27s%20Hill%20Cheese-Rolling%20and%20Wake\"&gt;cheese-rolling&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Brockworth%2C%20Gloucestershire\"&gt;Cooper's Hill&lt;/a&gt;. There is no official national costume, but a few are well established such as the &lt;a href=\"Pearly%20Kings%20and%20Queens\"&gt;Pearly Kings and Queens&lt;/a&gt; associated with cockneys, the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Morris%20dance\"&gt;Morris costume&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beefeater\"&gt;Beefeater&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCuisine.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"early%20modern%20period\"&gt;early modern period&lt;/a&gt; the food of England has historically been characterised by its simplicity of approach and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce. During the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; and through the Renaissance period, English cuisine enjoyed an excellent reputation, though a decline began during the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt; with the move away from the land and increasing urbanisation of the populace. The cuisine of England has, however, recently undergone a revival, which has been recognised by food critics with some good ratings in \"&lt;a href=\"Restaurant%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;\"s &lt;a href=\"best%20restaurant%20in%20the%20world\"&gt;best restaurant in the world&lt;/a&gt; charts. An early book of English recipes is the \"&lt;a href=\"Forme%20of%20Cury\"&gt;Forme of Cury&lt;/a&gt;\" from the royal court of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Richard II&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraditional examples of English food include the &lt;a href=\"Sunday%20roast\"&gt;Sunday roast&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a &lt;a href=\"roasting\"&gt;roasted joint&lt;/a&gt; (usually beef, &lt;a href=\"lamb%20and%20mutton\"&gt;lamb&lt;/a&gt;, chicken or pork) served with assorted vegetables, &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20pudding\"&gt;Yorkshire pudding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gravy\"&gt;gravy&lt;/a&gt;. Other prominent meals include &lt;a href=\"fish%20and%20chips\"&gt;fish and chips&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Full%20breakfast\"&gt;full English breakfast&lt;/a&gt; (generally consisting of &lt;a href=\"bacon\"&gt;bacon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sausages\"&gt;sausages&lt;/a&gt;, grilled tomatoes, fried bread, &lt;a href=\"black%20pudding\"&gt;black pudding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"baked%20beans\"&gt;baked beans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"edible%20mushroom\"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; and eggs). Various &lt;a href=\"meat%20pie\"&gt;meat pie&lt;/a&gt;s are consumed, such as &lt;a href=\"steak%20and%20kidney%20pie\"&gt;steak and kidney pie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"steak%20and%20ale%20pie\"&gt;steak and ale pie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cottage%20pie\"&gt;cottage pie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pork%20pie\"&gt;pork pie&lt;/a&gt; (usually eaten cold) and the &lt;a href=\"Cornish%20pasty\"&gt;Cornish pasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nSausages are commonly eaten, either as &lt;a href=\"bangers%20and%20mash\"&gt;bangers and mash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"toad%20in%20the%20hole\"&gt;toad in the hole&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20hotpot\"&gt;Lancashire hotpot&lt;/a&gt; is a well-known stew originating in the northwest. Some of the more popular cheeses are &lt;a href=\"Cheddar%20cheese\"&gt;Cheddar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Leicester\"&gt;Red Leicester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wensleydale%20%28cheese%29\"&gt;Wensleydale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Double%20Gloucester\"&gt;Double Gloucester&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stilton%20cheese\"&gt;Blue Stilton&lt;/a&gt;. Many &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Indian\"&gt;Anglo-Indian&lt;/a&gt; hybrid dishes, &lt;a href=\"curries\"&gt;curries&lt;/a&gt;, have been created, such as &lt;a href=\"chicken%20tikka%20masala\"&gt;chicken tikka masala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"balti%20%28food%29\"&gt;balti&lt;/a&gt;. Traditional English dessert dishes include &lt;a href=\"apple%20pie\"&gt;apple pie&lt;/a&gt; or other fruit pies; &lt;a href=\"spotted%20dick\"&gt;spotted dick&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 all generally served with &lt;a href=\"custard\"&gt;custard&lt;/a&gt;; and, more recently, &lt;a href=\"sticky%20toffee%20pudding\"&gt;sticky toffee pudding&lt;/a&gt;. Sweet pastries include &lt;a href=\"scones\"&gt;scones&lt;/a&gt; (either plain or containing dried fruit) served with jam or cream, dried fruit loaves, &lt;a href=\"Eccles%20cake\"&gt;Eccles cake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mince%20pie\"&gt;mince pie&lt;/a&gt;s as well as a wide range of sweet or spiced biscuits.\nCommon non-alcoholic drinks include tea, the popularity of which was increased by &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20of%20Braganza\"&gt;Catherine of Braganza&lt;/a&gt;, and coffee; frequently consumed alcoholic drinks include wine, &lt;a href=\"cider\"&gt;cider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"English%20beer\"&gt;English beer&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"bitter%20%28beer%29\"&gt;bitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mild%20ale\"&gt;mild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stout\"&gt;stout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"brown%20ale\"&gt;brown ale&lt;/a&gt;.\nVisual arts.\nThe earliest known examples are the prehistoric rock and &lt;a href=\"cave%20art\"&gt;cave art&lt;/a&gt; pieces, most prominent in &lt;a href=\"North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;North Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, Northumberland and &lt;a href=\"Cumbria\"&gt;Cumbria&lt;/a&gt;, but also feature further south, for example at &lt;a href=\"Creswell%20Crags\"&gt;Creswell Crags&lt;/a&gt;. With the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20culture\"&gt;Roman culture&lt;/a&gt; in the 1st century, various forms of art such as statues, busts, glasswork and mosaics were the norm. There are numerous surviving artefacts, such as those at &lt;a href=\"Lullingstone%20Roman%20Villa\"&gt;Lullingstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isurium%20Brigantum\"&gt;Aldborough&lt;/a&gt;. During the Early Middle Ages the style favoured sculpted crosses and ivories, manuscript painting, gold and enamel jewellery, demonstrating a love of intricate, interwoven designs such as in the &lt;a href=\"Staffordshire%20Hoard\"&gt;Staffordshire Hoard&lt;/a&gt; discovered in 2009. Some of these blended &lt;a href=\"Insular%20art\"&gt;Gaelic and Anglian&lt;/a&gt; styles, such as the &lt;a href=\"Lindisfarne%20Gospels\"&gt;Lindisfarne Gospels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vespasian%20Psalter\"&gt;Vespasian Psalter&lt;/a&gt;. Later &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20art\"&gt;Gothic art&lt;/a&gt; was popular at Winchester and Canterbury, examples survive such as &lt;a href=\"Benedictional%20of%20St.%20%C3%86thelwold\"&gt;Benedictional of St. \u00c6thelwold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luttrell%20Psalter\"&gt;Luttrell Psalter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tudor era saw &lt;a href=\"Artists%20of%20the%20Tudor%20court\"&gt;prominent artists&lt;/a&gt; as part of their court, portrait painting which would remain an enduring part of English art, was boosted by German &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Holbein%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Hans Holbein&lt;/a&gt;, natives such as &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Hilliard\"&gt;Nicholas Hilliard&lt;/a&gt; built on this. Under the Stuarts, Continental artists were influential especially the Flemish, examples from the period include &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20van%20Dyck\"&gt;Anthony van Dyck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Lely\"&gt;Peter Lely&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%20Kneller\"&gt;Godfrey Kneller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20Dobson\"&gt;William Dobson&lt;/a&gt;. The 18th century was a time of significance with the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Academy\"&gt;Royal Academy&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"classicism\"&gt;classicism&lt;/a&gt; based on the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20art\"&gt;High Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; prevailed, with &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Gainsborough\"&gt;Thomas Gainsborough&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Reynolds\"&gt;Joshua Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; becoming two of England's most treasured artists.\nIn the 19th century, &lt;a href=\"John%20Constable\"&gt;Constable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J.M.W.%20Turner\"&gt;Turner&lt;/a&gt; were major landscape artists. The &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20School%20%28art%20movement%29\"&gt;Norwich School&lt;/a&gt; continued the landscape tradition, while the &lt;a href=\"Pre-Raphaelite%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, led by artists such as &lt;a href=\"Holman%20Hunt\"&gt;Holman Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dante%20Gabriel%20Rossetti\"&gt;Dante Gabriel Rossetti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Everett%20Millais\"&gt;John Everett Millais&lt;/a&gt;, revived the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Renaissance\"&gt;Early Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; style with their vivid and detailed style. Prominent amongst 20th-century artists was &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Moore\"&gt;Henry Moore&lt;/a&gt;, regarded as the voice of British sculpture, and of British modernism in general. More recent painters include &lt;a href=\"Lucian%20Freud\"&gt;Lucian Freud&lt;/a&gt;, whose work \"&lt;a href=\"Benefits%20Supervisor%20Sleeping\"&gt;Benefits Supervisor Sleeping&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2008 set a world record for sale value of a painting by a then-living artist. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Royal Society of Arts&lt;/a&gt; is an organisation committed to the arts and culture.\nLiterature, poetry, and philosophy.\nEarly authors such as &lt;a href=\"Bede\"&gt;Bede&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alcuin\"&gt;Alcuin&lt;/a&gt; wrote in Latin. The period of &lt;a href=\"Old%20English%20literature\"&gt;Old English literature&lt;/a&gt; provided the epic poem \"&lt;a href=\"Beowulf\"&gt;Beowulf&lt;/a&gt;\" and the secular prose of the \"&lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\", along with Christian writings such as \"&lt;a href=\"Judith%20%28poem%29\"&gt;Judith&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A6dmon\"&gt;C\u00e6dmon&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"C%C3%A6dmon\"&gt;Hymn&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"hagiography\"&gt;hagiographies&lt;/a&gt;. Following the Norman conquest &lt;a href=\"Latin%20literature\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; continued amongst the educated classes, as well as an &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Norman%20literature\"&gt;Anglo-Norman literature&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Middle%20English%20literature\"&gt;Middle English literature&lt;/a&gt; emerged with &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20Chaucer\"&gt;Geoffrey Chaucer&lt;/a&gt;, author of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Canterbury%20Tales\"&gt;The Canterbury Tales&lt;/a&gt;\", along with &lt;a href=\"John%20Gower\"&gt;Gower&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Poet\"&gt;Pearl Poet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20Langland\"&gt;Langland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"William%20of%20Ockham\"&gt;William of Ockham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Bacon\"&gt;Roger Bacon&lt;/a&gt;, who were &lt;a href=\"Franciscans\"&gt;Franciscans&lt;/a&gt;, were major philosophers of the Middle Ages. &lt;a href=\"Julian%20of%20Norwich\"&gt;Julian of Norwich&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote \"&lt;a href=\"Revelations%20of%20Divine%20Love\"&gt;Revelations of Divine Love&lt;/a&gt;\", was a prominent Christian mystic. With the &lt;a href=\"English%20Renaissance\"&gt;English Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; literature in the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Modern%20English\"&gt;Early Modern English&lt;/a&gt; style appeared. &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;, whose works include \"&lt;a href=\"Hamlet\"&gt;Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Romeo%20and%20Juliet\"&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Macbeth\"&gt;Macbeth&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream\"&gt;A Midsummer Night's Dream&lt;/a&gt;\", remains one of the most championed authors in English literature.\n&lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Marlowe\"&gt;Christopher Marlowe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Spenser\"&gt;Edmund Spenser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Sydney\"&gt;Philip Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Kyd\"&gt;Thomas Kyd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Donne\"&gt;John Donne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Jonson\"&gt;Ben Jonson&lt;/a&gt; are other established authors of the &lt;a href=\"Elizabethan%20literature\"&gt;Elizabethan age&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Bacon\"&gt;Francis Bacon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Hobbes\"&gt;Thomas Hobbes&lt;/a&gt; wrote on &lt;a href=\"empiricism\"&gt;empiricism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"materialism\"&gt;materialism&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"scientific%20method\"&gt;scientific method&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"social%20contract\"&gt;social contract&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Filmer\"&gt;Filmer&lt;/a&gt; wrote on the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Right%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Divine Right of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Marvell\"&gt;Marvell&lt;/a&gt; was the best-known poet of the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20England\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"John%20Milton\"&gt;John Milton&lt;/a&gt; authored \"&lt;a href=\"Paradise%20Lost\"&gt;Paradise Lost&lt;/a&gt;\" during the &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20literature\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of the most prominent philosophers of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"John%20Locke\"&gt;John Locke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Paine\"&gt;Thomas Paine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Johnson\"&gt;Samuel Johnson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Bentham\"&gt;Jeremy Bentham&lt;/a&gt;. More radical elements were later countered by &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Burke\"&gt;Edmund Burke&lt;/a&gt; who is regarded as the founder of conservatism. The poet &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Pope\"&gt;Alexander Pope&lt;/a&gt; with his satirical verse became well regarded. The English played a significant role in &lt;a href=\"romanticism\"&gt;romanticism&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge\"&gt;Samuel Taylor Coleridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Byron\"&gt;Lord Byron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Keats\"&gt;John Keats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Shelley\"&gt;Mary Shelley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley\"&gt;Percy Bysshe Shelley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Blake\"&gt;William Blake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20Wordsworth\"&gt;William Wordsworth&lt;/a&gt; were major figures.\nIn response to the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Revolution\"&gt;Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, agrarian writers sought a way between &lt;a href=\"liberty\"&gt;liberty&lt;/a&gt; and tradition; &lt;a href=\"William%20Cobbett\"&gt;William Cobbett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"G.%20K.%20Chesterton\"&gt;G. K. Chesterton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hilaire%20Belloc\"&gt;Hilaire Belloc&lt;/a&gt; were main exponents, while the founder of &lt;a href=\"guild%20socialism\"&gt;guild socialism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Penty\"&gt;Arthur Penty&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cooperative%20movement\"&gt;cooperative movement&lt;/a&gt; advocate &lt;a href=\"G.%20D.%20H.%20Cole\"&gt;G.

It has its own distinct variations and regional peculiarities. Ballads featuring Robin Hood, printed by &lt;a href=\"Wynkyn%20de%20Worde\"&gt;Wynkyn de Worde&lt;/a&gt; in the 16th century, are an important artefact, as are &lt;a href=\"John%20Playford\"&gt;John Playford&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dancing%20Master\"&gt;The Dancing Master&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Harley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Oxford%20and%20Earl%20Mortimer\"&gt;Robert Harley's&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Roxburghe%20Ballads\"&gt;Roxburghe Ballads&lt;/a&gt;\" collections. Some of the best-known songs are \"&lt;a href=\"Greensleeves\"&gt;Greensleeves&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Pastime%20with%20Good%20Company\"&gt;Pastime with Good Company&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Maggie%20May%20%28folk%20song%29\"&gt;Maggie May&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Ladies\"&gt;Spanish Ladies&lt;/a&gt;\" amongst others. Many &lt;a href=\"nursery%20rhymes\"&gt;nursery rhymes&lt;/a&gt; are of English origin such as \"&lt;a href=\"Mary%2C%20Mary%2C%20Quite%20Contrary\"&gt;Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Roses%20Are%20Red\"&gt;Roses Are Red&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Jack%20and%20Jill%20%28nursery%20rhyme%29\"&gt;Jack and Jill&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"London%20Bridge%20Is%20Falling%20Down\"&gt;London Bridge Is Falling Down&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Grand%20Old%20Duke%20of%20York\"&gt;The Grand Old Duke of York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hey%20Diddle%20Diddle\"&gt;Hey Diddle Diddle&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Humpty%20Dumpty\"&gt;Humpty Dumpty&lt;/a&gt;\". Traditional English Christmas carols include \"&lt;a href=\"We%20Wish%20You%20a%20Merry%20Christmas\"&gt;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Noel\"&gt;The First Noel&lt;/a&gt;\", \u201c&lt;a href=\"I%20Saw%20Three%20Ships\"&gt;I Saw Three Ships&lt;/a&gt;\u201d and \"&lt;a href=\"God%20Rest%20You%20Merry%2C%20Gentlemen\"&gt;God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEarly English composers in classical music include Renaissance artists &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Tallis\"&gt;Thomas Tallis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20Byrd\"&gt;William Byrd&lt;/a&gt;, followed up by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Purcell\"&gt;Henry Purcell&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20music\"&gt;Baroque period&lt;/a&gt;. German-born &lt;a href=\"George%20Frideric%20Handel\"&gt;George Frideric Handel&lt;/a&gt; spent most of his composing life in London and became a national icon in Britain, creating some of the most well-known works of classical music, especially his English oratorios, \"&lt;a href=\"Messiah%20%28Handel%29\"&gt;The Messiah&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Solomon%20%28Handel%29\"&gt;Solomon&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Water%20Music%20%28Handel%29\"&gt;Water Music&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Music%20for%20the%20Royal%20Fireworks\"&gt;Music for the Royal Fireworks&lt;/a&gt;\". One of his four &lt;a href=\"Coronation%20Anthems%20%28Handel%29\"&gt;Coronation Anthems&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Zadok%20the%20Priest\"&gt;Zadok the Priest&lt;/a&gt;\", composed for the coronation of &lt;a href=\"George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;George II&lt;/a&gt;, has been performed at every subsequent &lt;a href=\"Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch\"&gt;British coronation&lt;/a&gt;, traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. \nClassical music attracted much attention from 1784 with the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20Triennial%20Music%20Festival\"&gt;Birmingham Triennial Music Festival&lt;/a&gt;, which was the longest running classical music festival of its kind until the final concerts in 1912. The &lt;a href=\"English%20Musical%20Renaissance\"&gt;English Musical Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; was a hypothetical development in the late 19th and early 20th century, when English composers, often those lecturing or trained at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20College%20of%20Music\"&gt;Royal College of Music&lt;/a&gt;, were said to have freed themselves from foreign musical influences. There was a revival in the profile of composers from England in the 20th century led by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Elgar\"&gt;Edward Elgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Britten\"&gt;Benjamin Britten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Delius\"&gt;Frederick Delius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Holst\"&gt;Gustav Holst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams\"&gt;Ralph Vaughan Williams&lt;/a&gt; and others. Present-day composers from England include &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Nyman\"&gt;Michael Nyman&lt;/a&gt;, best known for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Piano\"&gt;The Piano&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber\"&gt;Andrew Lloyd Webber&lt;/a&gt;, whose musicals have achieved enormous success in the &lt;a href=\"West%20End%20theatre\"&gt;West End&lt;/a&gt; and worldwide.\nIn &lt;a href=\"popular%20music\"&gt;popular music&lt;/a&gt;, many English bands and solo artists have been cited as the most influential and best-selling musicians of all time. Acts such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles\"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Led%20Zeppelin\"&gt;Led Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pink%20Floyd\"&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elton%20John\"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20%28band%29\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rod%20Stewart\"&gt;Rod Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20Bowie\"&gt;David Bowie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Rolling%20Stones\"&gt;The Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Def%20Leppard\"&gt;Def Leppard&lt;/a&gt; are among the highest-selling recording artists in the world. Many musical genres have origins in (or strong associations with) England, such as &lt;a href=\"British%20invasion\"&gt;British invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"progressive%20rock\"&gt;progressive rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hard%20rock\"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mod%20%28subculture%29\"&gt;Mod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glam%20rock\"&gt;glam rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Britpop\"&gt;Britpop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"indie%20rock\"&gt;indie rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gothic%20rock\"&gt;gothic rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shoegazing\"&gt;shoegazing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"acid%20house\"&gt;acid house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UK%20garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trip%20hop\"&gt;trip hop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drum%20and%20bass\"&gt;drum and bass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dubstep\"&gt;dubstep&lt;/a&gt;.\nLarge outdoor &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20music%20festivals%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;music festivals&lt;/a&gt; in the summer and autumn are popular, such as &lt;a href=\"Glastonbury%20Festival\"&gt;Glastonbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"V%20Festival\"&gt;V Festival&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Reading%20and%20Leeds%20Festivals\"&gt;Reading and Leeds Festivals&lt;/a&gt;. England was at the forefront of the illegal, free &lt;a href=\"rave\"&gt;rave&lt;/a&gt; movement from the late 1980s, which led to pan-European culture of &lt;a href=\"Teknival\"&gt;teknivals&lt;/a&gt; mirrored on the UK free festival movement and associated travelling lifestyle. The &lt;a href=\"Boishakhi%20Mela\"&gt;Boishakhi Mela&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20New%20Year\"&gt;Bengali New Year&lt;/a&gt; festival celebrated by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Bangladeshi\"&gt;British Bangladeshi&lt;/a&gt; community. It is the largest open-air Asian festival in Europe. After the &lt;a href=\"Notting%20Hill%20Carnival\"&gt;Notting Hill Carnival&lt;/a&gt;, it is the second-largest street festival in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; attracting over 80,000 visitors from across the country. \nThe most prominent &lt;a href=\"opera%20house\"&gt;opera house&lt;/a&gt; in England is the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Royal Opera House&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Covent%20Garden\"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Proms\"&gt;The Proms&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 a season of &lt;a href=\"orchestral\"&gt;orchestral&lt;/a&gt; classical concerts held primarily at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Albert%20Hall\"&gt;Royal Albert Hall&lt;/a&gt; in London \u2013 is a major cultural event in the English calendar, and takes place yearly. &lt;a href=\"The%20Royal%20Ballet\"&gt;The Royal Ballet&lt;/a&gt; is one of the world's foremost classical ballet companies, its reputation built on two prominent figures of 20th-century dance, \"&lt;a href=\"prima%20ballerina\"&gt;prima ballerina&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Margot%20Fonteyn\"&gt;Margot Fonteyn&lt;/a&gt; and choreographer &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Ashton\"&gt;Frederick Ashton&lt;/a&gt;.

As an equestrian master Astley had a skill for trick horse-riding, and when he added tumblers, &lt;a href=\"tightrope\"&gt;tightrope&lt;/a&gt;-walkers, &lt;a href=\"jugglers\"&gt;jugglers&lt;/a&gt;, performing dogs, and a &lt;a href=\"clown\"&gt;clown&lt;/a&gt; to fill time between his own demonstrations \u2013 the modern circus was born.\n&lt;a href=\"Pantomime\"&gt;Pantomime&lt;/a&gt; is a British &lt;a href=\"Musical%20theatre\"&gt;musical comedy&lt;/a&gt; stage production, designed for family entertainment. It is performed in theatres throughout the England during the Christmas and New Year season. The art originated in the 18th century with &lt;a href=\"John%20Weaver%20%28dancer%29\"&gt;John Weaver&lt;/a&gt;, a dance master and choreographer. In 19th century England it acquired its present form, which includes songs, slapstick comedy and dancing, employing gender-crossing actors, combining topical humour with a story loosely based on a well-known fairy tale.\nCinema.\nEngland (and the UK as a whole) has had a considerable influence on the history of the cinema, producing some of the greatest actors, directors and motion pictures of all time, including &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Hitchcock\"&gt;Alfred Hitchcock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Chaplin\"&gt;Charlie Chaplin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20Lean\"&gt;David Lean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laurence%20Olivier\"&gt;Laurence Olivier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivien%20Leigh\"&gt;Vivien Leigh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Gielgud\"&gt;John Gielgud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Sellers\"&gt;Peter Sellers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Julie%20Andrews\"&gt;Julie Andrews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Caine\"&gt;Michael Caine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Oldman\"&gt;Gary Oldman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Mirren\"&gt;Helen Mirren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kate%20Winslet\"&gt;Kate Winslet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Day-Lewis\"&gt;Daniel Day-Lewis&lt;/a&gt;. Hitchcock and Lean are among the most critically acclaimed filmmakers. Hitchcock's first thriller, \"\" (1926), helped shape the &lt;a href=\"Thriller%20film\"&gt;thriller&lt;/a&gt; genre in film, while his 1929 film, \"&lt;a href=\"Blackmail%20%281929%20film%29\"&gt;Blackmail&lt;/a&gt;\", is often regarded as the first British feature film.\nMajor film studios in England include &lt;a href=\"Pinewood%20Studios\"&gt;Pinewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elstree%20Studios\"&gt;Elstree&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shepperton%20Studios\"&gt;Shepperton&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the most commercially successful films of all time have been produced in England, including two of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20highest-grossing%20film%20series\"&gt;highest-grossing film franchises&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Harry%20Potter%20%28film%20series%29\"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"James%20Bond%20%28film%20series%29\"&gt;James Bond&lt;/a&gt;\"). &lt;a href=\"Ealing%20Studios\"&gt;Ealing Studios&lt;/a&gt; in London has a claim to being the oldest continuously working film studio in the world. Famous for recording many motion picture &lt;a href=\"film%20scores\"&gt;film scores&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"London%20Symphony%20Orchestra\"&gt;London Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt; first performed film music in 1935. The &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20Film%20Productions\"&gt;Hammer Horror&lt;/a&gt; films starring &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Lee\"&gt;Christopher Lee&lt;/a&gt; saw the production of the first gory horror films showing blood and guts in colour.\nThe &lt;a href=\"BFI%20Top%20100%20British%20films\"&gt;BFI Top 100 British films&lt;/a&gt; includes \"&lt;a href=\"Monty%20Python%27s%20Life%20of%20Brian\"&gt;Monty Python's Life of Brian&lt;/a&gt;\" (1979), a film regularly voted the funniest of all time by the UK public. English producers are also active in &lt;a href=\"international%20co-productions\"&gt;international co-productions&lt;/a&gt; and English actors, directors and crew feature regularly in American films. The UK film council ranked &lt;a href=\"David%20Yates\"&gt;David Yates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Nolan\"&gt;Christopher Nolan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Newell%20%28director%29\"&gt;Mike Newell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ridley%20Scott\"&gt;Ridley Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Greengrass\"&gt;Paul Greengrass&lt;/a&gt; the five most commercially successful English directors since 2001. Other contemporary English directors include &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Mendes\"&gt;Sam Mendes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Ritchie\"&gt;Guy Ritchie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Curtis\"&gt;Richard Curtis&lt;/a&gt;.

The visual effects company &lt;a href=\"Framestore\"&gt;Framestore&lt;/a&gt; in London has produced some of the most critically acclaimed special effects in modern film. Many successful Hollywood films have been based on English people, &lt;a href=\"British%20literature\"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; or events. The &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Walt%20Disney%20Animation%20Studios%20films\"&gt;'English Cycle'&lt;/a&gt; of Disney animated films include \"&lt;a href=\"Alice%20in%20Wonderland\"&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jungle%20Book\"&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Winnie%20the%20Pooh\"&gt;Winnie the Pooh&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMuseums, libraries, and galleries.\n&lt;a href=\"English%20Heritage\"&gt;English Heritage&lt;/a&gt; is a governmental body with a broad remit of managing the historic sites, artefacts and environments of England. It is currently sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Department%20for%20Digital%2C%20Culture%2C%20Media%20and%20Sport\"&gt;Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of the best-known of these are: &lt;a href=\"Hadrian%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Hadrian's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonehenge%2C%20Avebury%20and%20Associated%20Sites\"&gt;Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20London\"&gt;Tower of London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jurassic%20Coast\"&gt;Jurassic Coast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saltaire\"&gt;Saltaire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironbridge%20Gorge\"&gt;Ironbridge Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Studley%20Royal%20Park\"&gt;Studley Royal Park&lt;/a&gt; and various others.\nThere are many museums in England, but perhaps the most notable is London's &lt;a href=\"British%20Museum\"&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Its collection of more than seven million objects is one of the largest and most comprehensive in the world, sourced from every continent, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginning to the present. The &lt;a href=\"British%20Library\"&gt;British Library&lt;/a&gt; in London is the &lt;a href=\"national%20library\"&gt;national library&lt;/a&gt; and is one of the world's largest &lt;a href=\"research%20libraries\"&gt;research libraries&lt;/a&gt;, holding over 150\u00a0million items in almost all known languages and formats; including around 25\u00a0million books. The most senior art gallery is the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery\"&gt;National Gallery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Trafalgar%20Square\"&gt;Trafalgar Square&lt;/a&gt;, which houses a collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century to 1900. The &lt;a href=\"Tate\"&gt;Tate&lt;/a&gt; galleries house the national collections of British and international modern art; they also host the famously controversial &lt;a href=\"Turner%20Prize\"&gt;Turner Prize&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest broadcaster in the world. It operates numerous television and radio stations in the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the &lt;a href=\"Television%20licensing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;television licence&lt;/a&gt;.

Sports originating in England include &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt;, badminton, &lt;a href=\"squash%20%28sport%29\"&gt;squash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rounders\"&gt;rounders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"field%20hockey\"&gt;hockey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snooker\"&gt;snooker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"billiards\"&gt;billiards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"darts\"&gt;darts&lt;/a&gt;, table tennis, &lt;a href=\"bowls\"&gt;bowls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"netball\"&gt;netball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"thoroughbred\"&gt;thoroughbred&lt;/a&gt; horseracing, &lt;a href=\"greyhound%20racing\"&gt;greyhound racing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fox%20hunting\"&gt;fox hunting&lt;/a&gt;. It has helped the development of &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;, sailing and &lt;a href=\"Formula%20One\"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt;.\nFootball is the &lt;a href=\"Sport%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Popularity\"&gt;most popular&lt;/a&gt; of these sports. The &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England national football team&lt;/a&gt;, whose home venue is &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, played &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in the first ever international football match in 1872. Referred to as the \"home of football\" by &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt;, England hosted the &lt;a href=\"1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1966 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and won the tournament by defeating &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20132 in the &lt;a href=\"1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Geoff%20Hurst\"&gt;Geoff Hurst&lt;/a&gt; scoring a &lt;a href=\"hat-trick\"&gt;hat-trick&lt;/a&gt;. With a British television audience peak of 32.30\u00a0million viewers, the final is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20most-watched%20television%20broadcasts%23United%20Kingdom\"&gt;most watched television event ever&lt;/a&gt; in the UK.\nAt club level, England is recognised by FIFA as the birthplace of club football, due to &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield F.C.&lt;/a&gt; founded in 1857 being the world's oldest club. &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20Association\"&gt;The Football Association&lt;/a&gt; is the oldest governing body in the sport, with the &lt;a href=\"Laws%20of%20the%20Game%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; of football first drafted in 1863 by &lt;a href=\"Ebenezer%20Cobb%20Morley\"&gt;Ebenezer Cobb Morley&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20League\"&gt;The Football League&lt;/a&gt; were the first cup and league competitions respectively. In the modern day, the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; is the world's most-watched football league, most lucrative, and amongst the elite.\nAs is the case throughout the UK, football in England is notable for the rivalries between clubs and the passion of the supporters, which includes a tradition of football chants. The most successful English football team in the European Cup/UEFA Champions League is &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool F.C.&lt;/a&gt; who have won the competition on six occasions. Other English success has come from &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, winning the competition on 3 occasions; &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.\"&gt;Nottingham Forest F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea F.C.&lt;/a&gt; on 2 occasions, &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa F.C.&lt;/a&gt; have only won the trophy once.\n&lt;a href=\"Cricket\"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt; is generally thought to have been developed in the early medieval period among the farming and metalworking communities of the &lt;a href=\"Weald\"&gt;Weald&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"England%20cricket%20team\"&gt;England cricket team&lt;/a&gt; is a composite England and Wales, team. One of the game's top rivalries is &lt;a href=\"The%20Ashes\"&gt;The Ashes&lt;/a&gt; series between England and &lt;a href=\"Australia%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, contested since 1882. The climax of the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Ashes%20series\"&gt;2005 Ashes&lt;/a&gt; was viewed by 7.4\u00a0million as it was available on terrestrial television. England has hosted five &lt;a href=\"Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;s (1975, 1979, 1983, 1999 and &lt;a href=\"2019%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;), winning the 2019 edition in a final regarded as one of the greatest one day internationals ever played.

In the domestic competition, the &lt;a href=\"County%20Championship\"&gt;County Championship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; are by far the most successful club having won the competition 32\u00a0times outright and sharing it on 1 other occasion. &lt;a href=\"Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground\"&gt;Lord's Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt; situated in London is sometimes referred to as the \"Mecca of Cricket\".\n&lt;a href=\"William%20Penny%20Brookes\"&gt;William Penny Brookes&lt;/a&gt; was prominent in organising the format for the modern &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;. In 1994, then President of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;IOC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Antonio%20Samaranch\"&gt;Juan Antonio Samaranch&lt;/a&gt;, laid a wreath on Brooke's grave, and said, \"I came to pay homage and tribute to Dr Brookes, who really was the founder of the modern Olympic Games\". London has hosted the &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Summer Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; three times, in &lt;a href=\"1908%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1908&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1948%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"2012%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;.

Originally the flag was used by the maritime &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Genoa\"&gt;Republic of Genoa&lt;/a&gt;. The English monarch paid a tribute to the &lt;a href=\"Doge%20of%20Genoa\"&gt;Doge of Genoa&lt;/a&gt; from 1190 onwards so that English ships could fly the flag as a means of protection when entering the Mediterranean.\nA red cross was a symbol for many &lt;a href=\"Crusaders\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; in the 12th and 13th centuries.

Since 1606 the St George's Cross has formed part of the design of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Flag\"&gt;Union Flag&lt;/a&gt;, a Pan-British flag designed by King &lt;a href=\"James%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;James I&lt;/a&gt;.

The Tudor rose was adopted as a national emblem of England around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Wars%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;Wars of the Roses&lt;/a&gt; as a symbol of peace. It is a &lt;a href=\"syncreticism\"&gt;syncretic&lt;/a&gt; symbol in that it merged the white rose of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20York\"&gt;Yorkists&lt;/a&gt; and the red rose of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;Lancastrians&lt;/a&gt;\u2014cadet branches of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plantagenet\"&gt;Plantagenets&lt;/a&gt; who went to war over control of the nation. It is also known as the \"Rose of England\". The &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; tree is a symbol of England, representing strength and endurance. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Oak\"&gt;Royal Oak&lt;/a&gt; symbol and &lt;a href=\"Oak%20Apple%20Day\"&gt;Oak Apple Day&lt;/a&gt; commemorate the escape of King &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles II&lt;/a&gt; from the grasp of the parliamentarians after his father's execution: he hid in an oak tree to avoid detection before safely reaching exile.\nThe Royal Arms of England, a national &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;coat of arms&lt;/a&gt; featuring three lions, originated with its adoption by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20the%20Lionheart\"&gt;Richard the Lionheart&lt;/a&gt; in 1198. It is &lt;a href=\"blazon\"&gt;blazon&lt;/a&gt;ed as \"gules, three lions passant guardant or\" and it provides one of the most prominent symbols of England; it is similar to the traditional arms of &lt;a href=\"Normandy\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt;. England does not have an official designated national anthem, as the United Kingdom as a whole has \"&lt;a href=\"God%20Save%20the%20Queen\"&gt;God Save the Queen&lt;/a&gt;\". However, the following are often considered unofficial &lt;a href=\"National%20anthem%20of%20England\"&gt;English national anthems&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Jerusalem%20%28hymn%29\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20Hope%20and%20Glory\"&gt;Land of Hope and Glory&lt;/a&gt;\" (used for England during the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;2002 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;), and \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Vow%20to%20Thee%2C%20My%20Country\"&gt;I Vow to Thee, My Country&lt;/a&gt;\". England's &lt;a href=\"National%20Day\"&gt;National Day&lt;/a&gt; is 23 April which is &lt;a href=\"St%20George%27s%20Day%20in%20England\"&gt;Saint George's Day&lt;/a&gt;: Saint George is the patron saint of England."
