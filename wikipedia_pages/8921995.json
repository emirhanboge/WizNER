    "text": "The Ch\u00e2teau d'Harcourt, situated in the \"&lt;a href=\"Communes%20in%20France\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Harcourt%2C%20Eure\"&gt;Harcourt&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eure\"&gt;Eure&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; of France, is a masterpiece of medieval architecture. The cradle of the &lt;a href=\"Harcourt%20family\"&gt;Harcourt family&lt;/a&gt;, the castle is one of the best preserved castles in the country and contains the oldest &lt;a href=\"arboretum\"&gt;arboretum&lt;/a&gt; in France.\nHistory.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Harcourt%20family\"&gt;lords of Harcourt&lt;/a&gt; trace their origins to the year 1000, it is only in the second half of the 12th century that the existence of a castle can be proven from historical texts. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20II%20d%27Harcourt\"&gt;Robert II d'Harcourt&lt;/a&gt; was a companion in the &lt;a href=\"crusade\"&gt;crusade&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Lionheart\"&gt;Richard Lionheart&lt;/a&gt;; the first stone castle was certainly built by him. Harcourts appear later among the most important barons of &lt;a href=\"Normandy\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jean%20II%20d%27Harcourt\"&gt;Jean II d'Harcourt&lt;/a&gt;, for example, was named \"Marshal of France\" () and accommodated in his residence King &lt;a href=\"Philip%20III%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip III&lt;/a&gt;. In 1338, King &lt;a href=\"Philip%20VI%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip VI&lt;/a&gt;, set up the &lt;a href=\"seigniory\"&gt;seigniory&lt;/a&gt; of Harcourt, with the Ch\u00e2teau d'Harcourt forming its principal town.\nThe fortress appears to have seldom been under siege through history. It is only at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years' War&lt;/a&gt; that Harcourt became a military base. In 1418, the castle was claimed by the English, but they were eventually expelled by the counts of &lt;a href=\"Jean%20de%20Dunois\"&gt;Dunois&lt;/a&gt;, Eu and &lt;a href=\"Louis%20de%20Luxembourg-Saint-Pol\"&gt;Saint-Pol&lt;/a&gt; in 1449. As the war came to a close, the domain returned to the &lt;a href=\"Rieux%20family\"&gt;Rieux family&lt;/a&gt;, then, starting from the second half of the 16th century, to the powerful &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Guise\"&gt;Lorraine-Guise family&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"French%20Wars%20of%20Religion\"&gt;French Wars of Religion&lt;/a&gt; caused an increase in defensive fortifications in the castle. In 1588, the members of a league occupied the castle. In the 17th century, the castle lost all military interest; it was then partially abandoned and invaded by vegetation after &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Gervais%20Delamarre\"&gt;Louis Gervais Delamarre&lt;/a&gt; acquired it in 1802. With his death, Harcourt was bestowed to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Academy%20of%20Agriculture%20of%20France\"&gt;Royal Academy of Agriculture of France&lt;/a&gt; (). Today, the council general of Eure is the owner.\nArchitecture.\nIt is thought that the Ch\u00e2teau d'Harcourt consisted of the beginning of a &lt;a href=\"motte-and-bailey\"&gt;motte-and-bailey&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by a ditch, like many of the other fortresses of the time. In the 12th century, a square stone tower took the place of earlier wooden constructions. The castellan architecture then evolved according to the progression of &lt;a href=\"siege\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt;s, and the rise of its successive owners. In the 13th century, the old &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; was integrated in a polygonal castle. The &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28fortification%29\"&gt;bailey&lt;/a&gt; was protected by a curtain wall punctuated by nine round towers. Ahead of the curtain wall, a deep ditch, dry most of the time (lacking a river to feed it), girdled the structure.\nThrough the 14th century, the defence of the castle continued to improve. A monumental fortified gate, a &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;ch\u00e2telet&lt;/a&gt;, was installed to defend the more exposed of the two entries. The archeries were enlarged to allow firing &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the 17th century, Marie Fran\u00e7oise de Brancas (d.1715), wife of &lt;a href=\"Alphonse%20Henri%2C%20Count%20of%20Harcourt\"&gt;Alphonse Henri, Count of Harcourt&lt;/a&gt;, undertook to refit the medieval fortress to make it more hospitable. A friend of &lt;a href=\"Madame%20de%20Maintenon\"&gt;Madame de Maintenon&lt;/a&gt;, she demolished three sides of the polygonal castle and thus opened her apartments to the light. With a similar aim, large rectangular bays were bored and the interior disposition was re-examined.\nThe medieval Ch\u00e2teau d'Harcourt appears truncated today, especially as the top of the keep was levelled to bring it to the same height as the other buildings. There is no longer any building in the bailey, though a chapel was probably there formerly.\nThe castle is listed as a \"&lt;a href=\"monument%20historique\"&gt;monument historique&lt;/a&gt;\" by the &lt;a href=\"French%20Ministry%20of%20Culture\"&gt;French Ministry of Culture&lt;/a&gt;."
