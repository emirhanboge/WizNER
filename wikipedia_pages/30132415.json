    "text": "Harold \"Mick\" Crocker (December 14, 1927 \u2013 December 11, 2014) was an Australian professional &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; footballer who played in the 1940s and 1950s. An &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Australia national&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Queensland state&lt;/a&gt; representative back-row forward, he played his club career in Brisbane with &lt;a href=\"Souths%20Logan%20Magpies\"&gt;Souths&lt;/a&gt; and in Sydney with &lt;a href=\"Parramatta%20Eels\"&gt;Parramatta&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a successful career as a Queensland and then Australian international representative, in the 1954 pre-season Crocker signed a then-record one-season deal for an Australian to move south and play for Sydney club &lt;a href=\"Parramatta%20Eels\"&gt;Parramatta&lt;/a&gt; in order to assist his family who had lost their home in a fire the previous year. Parramatta finished the &lt;a href=\"1954%20NSWRFL%20season\"&gt;1954 NSWRFL season&lt;/a&gt; with the wooden spoon however. In the postseason Crocker was selected for the &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Australian national team&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign for the &lt;a href=\"1954%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1954 Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt; tournament, the first ever, which was held in France. Crocker didn't play in the Kangaroos' first match which was lost to &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, but was selected as a second-row forward for the second match against &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; which Australia won. He played in the third match against &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; which the Australians lost, meaning they would fail to reach the final. He is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 278. The following season was Crocker's last in the NSWRFL Premiership's first grade.\nIn 2009 Crocker was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame."
