Sviatoshyn &lt;a href=\"neighborhood\"&gt;neighborhood&lt;/a&gt; borders the &lt;a href=\"Nyvka%20River\"&gt;Nyvka River&lt;/a&gt; (\"Borshchahivka River\") in the west, that flows through there and falls into the &lt;a href=\"Irpin%20River\"&gt;Irpin River&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dnieper\"&gt;Dnieper&lt;/a&gt; basin. There is the beginning on the opposite side of the Nyvka River.\nThe east boundary of the suburb is the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Kovel\"&gt;Kovel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"railway\"&gt;railway&lt;/a&gt;. There are , and neighbourhoods in the north of Sviatoshyn and &lt;a href=\"Borshchahivka\"&gt;Borshchahivka&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhood, terrain, village and &lt;a href=\"Petropavlivska%20Borshchahivka\"&gt;Petropavlivska Borshchahivka&lt;/a&gt; village in the south.\nAll Sviatoshyn's adjacent neighbourhoods and suburbs belong to the &lt;a href=\"Sviatoshyn%20Raion\"&gt;Sviatoshyn Raion&lt;/a&gt; as well, except Petropavlivska Borshchahivka village. That village is in the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv-Sviatoshyn%20Raion\"&gt;Kyiv-Sviatoshyn Raion&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"municipality\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt;) of the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20Oblast\"&gt;Kyiv Oblast&lt;/a&gt; (region).\nBy roads, the suburb is located:\nThe core Sviatoshyn road Peremohy Avenue is a part of &lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E40\"&gt;European route E40&lt;/a&gt;, which is the main &lt;a href=\"highway\"&gt;highway&lt;/a&gt; from Kyiv to the most &lt;a href=\"European%20countries\"&gt;European countries&lt;/a&gt;. There is going through the suburb from north to south. It includes and there.\nName.\nThere are two hypotheses of the name of Sviatoshyn existing.\nThe first one comes from a version that there was a \"Saint &lt;a href=\"Grove%20%28nature%29\"&gt;Grove&lt;/a&gt; (Sviatyi, \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u0430\u0439)\" in there. That was a &lt;a href=\"sacred%20place\"&gt;sacred place&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"pagan\"&gt;pagan&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe second version says that the name is derived from the nickname of the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Chernigov\"&gt;Prince of Chernigov&lt;/a&gt; , who lived in the 12th century. His original name was &lt;a href=\"Sviatoslav\"&gt;Sviatoslav&lt;/a&gt; and he was a son of &lt;a href=\"Davyd%20Sviatoslavich\"&gt;Davyd Sviatoslavich&lt;/a&gt; and a grandson of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prince%20of%20Kyiv\"&gt;Grand Prince of Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sviatoslav%20II\"&gt;Sviatoslav II&lt;/a&gt;. It is alleged that he owned a land at neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Borshchahivka\"&gt;Borshchahivka&lt;/a&gt; village. In 1106 the prince Sviatoslav donated all his property to the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20Pechersk%20Lavra\"&gt;Kyiv Pechersk Lavra&lt;/a&gt; and became a &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; of it. He took the monk Christian name &lt;a href=\"Nikola\"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; (Nikolai, ). Since he had the born name &lt;a href=\"Sviatoslav\"&gt;Sviatoslav&lt;/a&gt; and was very devout he was given the informal nickname Sviatosha. Sviatosha means a pious, godly religious person.\nIn itself the Ukrainian word \"Sviatoshyn\" means \"Sviatosha's\", that is, something that belongs to Sviatosha.\nName's spellings.\nIn contrast to &lt;a href=\"English%20speaking%20countries\"&gt;English speaking countries&lt;/a&gt;, the names of a city's &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, that belong to &lt;a href=\"city%20council\"&gt;city council&lt;/a&gt;s areas, do not have so strict spelling rules, because their name do not play any significant roles in an official city's division to local municipalities (&lt;a href=\"raion\"&gt;raion&lt;/a&gt;s) or in the &lt;a href=\"postal%20system\"&gt;postal system&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ethnographer\"&gt;ethnographer&lt;/a&gt; in his work \"\" in 1884 mentioned this place as \"a &lt;a href=\"woodland\"&gt;woodland&lt;/a&gt; called Sviatoshyn\". There is a document \"The report of the Committee to facilitate accomplishment of the villa area in the locality Sviatoshyn of the Kyiv province and district. Kyiv, 1903\" existing. At the beginning of the 20th century the dacha village was called Sviatoshyn (\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044a - in the ).\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20era\"&gt;Soviet era&lt;/a&gt; there was a trend to change names of settlements, especially small ones, by putting the &lt;a href=\"suffix\"&gt;suffix&lt;/a&gt; \"-o\". So that since the 1930s on all maps of Kyiv, both &lt;a href=\"Russian%20language\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20language\"&gt;Ukrainian language&lt;/a&gt;s, the suburb was marked as Sviatoshyno (\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0448\u0438\u043d\u043e). Settlement names with the suffix \"-o\" are more typical of Russian language than Ukrainian, so sometimes the name Sviatoshyne (\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0435) was used in Ukrainian spelling. Despite of that there is Sviatoshyn (\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0448\u0438\u043d) article included in that was published by the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Soviet%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt; editorial office.\nSince the station of the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20Metro\"&gt;Kyiv Metro&lt;/a&gt;, which is the suburb's landmark, was renamed &lt;a href=\"Sviatoshyn%20%28Kyiv%20Metro%29\"&gt;Sviatoshyn (\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0448\u0438\u043d) station&lt;/a&gt;, this variant of suburb spelling has been started broadly used. Ukrainian &lt;a href=\"linguist\"&gt;linguist&lt;/a&gt;s insist on using Sviatoshyn (\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0448\u0438\u043d) as the locality name. In spite of this, sometimes the name Sviatoshyno (\u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0448\u0438\u043d\u043e) has still been used, even in official documents of the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20City%20Council\"&gt;Kyiv City Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly time.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Kievan%20Rus\"&gt;Kievan Rus&lt;/a&gt; epoch it was a territory of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Polans\"&gt;Eastern Polans&lt;/a&gt; and approximately 10 kilometres to the west, on the left bank of the &lt;a href=\"Irpin%20River\"&gt;Irpin River&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drevlians\"&gt;Drevlians&lt;/a&gt;' land began.\nAt the time of Kievan Rus and the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; the land belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Kyiv\"&gt;Principality of Kyiv&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is alleged that in the 12th century the owner of this land was the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Chernigov\"&gt;Prince of Chernigov&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sviatoslav\"&gt;Sviatoslav&lt;/a&gt;), who donated it to the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20Pechersk%20Lavra\"&gt;Kyiv Pechersk Lavra&lt;/a&gt;. Until the beginning of the 17th century this area belonged to Kyiv monasteries.\nThe first mention of the area name \"Sviatoshyn\" was in 1619, when this land was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Kyiv Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Crown of the Kingdom of Poland&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Lublin\"&gt;Union of Lublin&lt;/a&gt;. At that time the king &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%20III%20Vasa\"&gt;Sigismund III Vasa&lt;/a&gt; determined the metes and bounds of Kyiv's &lt;a href=\"Burgess%20%28title%29\"&gt;burgesses&lt;/a&gt; land possession in his &lt;a href=\"charter\"&gt;charter&lt;/a&gt;. In particular it was said that Kyiv's citizens boundary went \"through an &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; grove to Sviatoshyn side\".\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cossack%20Hetmanate\"&gt;Cossack Hetmanate&lt;/a&gt;, the present Sviatoshyn territory belonged to the .\nIn the 1780s, at the time when this land was included into the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20Viceroyalty\"&gt;Kyiv Viceroyalty&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Magdeburg%20rights\"&gt;Magdeburg rights&lt;/a&gt; of Kyiv were revoked so Sviatoshyn area went to the &lt;a href=\"state%20ownership\"&gt;state ownership&lt;/a&gt;.\nUntil the end of the 19th century, that land had been mentioned like Sviatoshyn wood, grove or forest, and it was a part of the &lt;a href=\"volost\"&gt;volost&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20Governorate\"&gt;Kyiv Governorate&lt;/a&gt;. There were no allusions about any permanent human settlements in there at that time.\nDacha village.\nIn 1897 the Sviatoshyn land, which had been occupied by a &lt;a href=\"pine\"&gt;pine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grove%20%28nature%29\"&gt;grove&lt;/a&gt;, was divided into 450 &lt;a href=\"Land%20lot\"&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt; and leased for 99 years. Thus \u0430 dacha village (&lt;a href=\"summer%20colony\"&gt;summer colony&lt;/a&gt;) was set up there.\nA &lt;a href=\"grid%20plan\"&gt;grid plan&lt;/a&gt; was implemented in the village. That area master plan is typical of dacha summer settlements. The core road of Sviatoshyn was &lt;a href=\"Brest-Litovsk\"&gt;Brest-Litovsk&lt;/a&gt;y highway, now , that went from east to west dividing the village into two unequal parts.\nThe villa projects were created by the Kyiv &lt;a href=\"architect\"&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt;s and . A lot of powerful, influential and rich people had villas there. In particular, villa owners were &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20University\"&gt;Kyiv University&lt;/a&gt; professors, three Kyiv &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt;s, businessmen including members of the \"&lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; magnate\" &lt;a href=\"Tereshchenko%20family\"&gt;Tereshchenko family&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe popularity of the villa area was growing up because of a pine grove, a pond and a good &lt;a href=\"transport%20infrastructure\"&gt;transport infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. Simultaneously with developing the land area, in 1898 a &lt;a href=\"narrow-gauge%20railway\"&gt;narrow-gauge railway&lt;/a&gt; was laid from Kyiv and it was used as a &lt;a href=\"horsecar\"&gt;horsecar&lt;/a&gt; tram line then &lt;a href=\"steam%20tram-car\"&gt;steam tram-car&lt;/a&gt;s operated there. In 1901 the village was connected to an &lt;a href=\"electricity%20network\"&gt;electricity network&lt;/a&gt; so on 1 May that year &lt;a href=\"electric%20tram\"&gt;electric tram&lt;/a&gt;s were launched. In 1902 &lt;a href=\"Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Kovel\"&gt;Kovel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"railway\"&gt;railway&lt;/a&gt;, which goes along the east edge of Sviatoshyn village, was finished up building and was opened.\nIn 1911 one of the oldest Kyiv's &lt;a href=\"movie%20theater\"&gt;cinemas&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Projection%20screen\"&gt;screen&lt;/a&gt;\") was opened at the corner of Brest-Litovsky Highway and the 3rd Prosika.\nBetween the village and suburb was &lt;a href=\"Sviatoshyn%20Airfield\"&gt;Sviatoshyn Airfield&lt;/a&gt; where the pilot &lt;a href=\"Pyotr%20Nesterov\"&gt;Pyotr Nesterov&lt;/a&gt; introduced his famous &lt;a href=\"aerobatics\"&gt;aerobatics&lt;/a&gt; flights.\nIn 1919 the village was included into the Kyiv City Council area.\nSoviet era.\nAs a result of the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%E2%80%93Soviet%20War\"&gt;Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War&lt;/a&gt; (1917\u20131921) and the &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20War\"&gt;Polish\u2013Soviet War&lt;/a&gt; (1919\u20131921) Kyiv City and its suburbs was finally captured by the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt;. In 1921 &lt;a href=\"Bolshevik\"&gt;Bolshevik&lt;/a&gt;s conducted the &lt;a href=\"administrative%20subdivision\"&gt;administrative subdivision&lt;/a&gt; reform, so Kyiv was divided into 5 &lt;a href=\"raion\"&gt;raion&lt;/a&gt;s (districts) and Sviatoshyn was included into the City Council area permanently.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bolshevik%20government\"&gt;Bolshevik government&lt;/a&gt; was conducting the &lt;a href=\"nationalisation\"&gt;nationalisation&lt;/a&gt; policy so that many dacha &lt;a href=\"villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt;s were &lt;a href=\"expropriated\"&gt;expropriated&lt;/a&gt;. The best villas were transferred to state and &lt;a href=\"trade%20union\"&gt;trade union&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"sanatorium\"&gt;sanatorium&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"boarding%20school\"&gt;boarding school&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Young%20Pioneer%20camp\"&gt;Young Pioneer camp&lt;/a&gt;s. Some other villas and &lt;a href=\"cottage\"&gt;cottage&lt;/a&gt;s were converted to &lt;a href=\"communal%20apartment\"&gt;communal apartment&lt;/a&gt;s. In practice it means that a house owner family was left just one &lt;a href=\"bedroom\"&gt;bedroom&lt;/a&gt;, a rest of bedrooms were given to other families, which usually originated from the &lt;a href=\"working%20class\"&gt;working class&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"kitchen\"&gt;kitchen&lt;/a&gt; room and a &lt;a href=\"bathroom\"&gt;bathroom&lt;/a&gt; were used by all families together, that lived in a house.\nIn the 1930s Sviatoshyn's St. Nicholas &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; church was demolished by Bolsheviks. However, on the south-west edge of Sviatoshyn the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; parish of the &lt;a href=\"Exaltation%20of%20the%20Holy%20Cross\"&gt;Exaltation of the Holy Cross&lt;/a&gt; was existing during the whole time of the &lt;a href=\"Communist\"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; rule. It was only one the refuge for Roman Catholics in all Kyiv region.\nIn 1941 during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"general%20staff\"&gt;general staff&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20Fortified%20Region\"&gt;Kyiv Fortified Region&lt;/a&gt; was situated in place of present Kyiv &lt;a href=\"secondary%20school\"&gt;secondary school&lt;/a&gt; No. 140. and next to it, the operational team of the command post of the &lt;a href=\"Southwestern%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29\"&gt;Southwestern Front&lt;/a&gt; was located at the modern address 80 Verkhovynna Street. In 1944-1945 the training centre of &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20partisan\"&gt;Soviet partisan&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"guerrilla\"&gt;guerrilla&lt;/a&gt;s) located in the house at 10 the 2nd Prosika. There are a complex of monuments at Soviet soldiers' graves who killed in &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kyiv%20%281943%29\"&gt;battle of Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; in 1943 at the .\nAt the end of the 1940s &lt;a href=\"Sviatoshyn%20Airfield\"&gt;Sviatoshyn Airfield&lt;/a&gt; was passed to ownership of an &lt;a href=\"Antonov%20Serial%20Production%20Plant\"&gt;aircraft serial production plant&lt;/a&gt; that since 1952 has been headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Antonov\"&gt;Antonov&lt;/a&gt; state company. In 1988 the company produced the largest ever aircraft &lt;a href=\"Antonov%20An-225%20Mriya\"&gt;Antonov An-225 Mriya&lt;/a&gt;. Together with the aircraft factory development the new village began being built next to the north-east edge of Sviatoshyn. The name Aviamistechko (, ) means \"aviation town\". Sometimes this locality has been called \"Novosviatoshyn\" (\"New Sviatoshyn\") as well.\nIn 1947 the clothing factory \"Kashtan\" was launched; it was one of the biggest producer of men's &lt;a href=\"shirt\"&gt;shirt&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"USSR\"&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt;.\nLate in the 1950s the new &lt;a href=\"housing%20estate\"&gt;housing estate&lt;/a&gt; was started building on the land of the former vegetable farm \"Sviatoshyn\", that had been located north of the neighbourhood. Besides residential buildings there have been numerous &lt;a href=\"research%20institute\"&gt;research institute&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;Ukrainian Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; situated in there. Therefore, the suburb got the name Akademmistechko (, ), which means \"academic town\".\nIn 1971 &lt;a href=\"Sviatoshyn%20%28Kyiv%20Metro%29\"&gt;Sviatoshyn(o)&lt;/a&gt; station of the &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20Metro\"&gt;Kyiv Metro&lt;/a&gt; was opened on the east edge of neighbourhood, next to the same name railway station.\nAt the beginning of the 1970s a new housing estate of &lt;a href=\"tower%20block\"&gt;tower block&lt;/a&gt;s was begun erecting in the north-west part of Sviatoshyn and south-east part of suburbs, for that all existing former dacha houses had been demolished in there. In 1979\u20131980 the Ukrainian &lt;a href=\"poet\"&gt;poet&lt;/a&gt; and Soviet &lt;a href=\"political%20prisoner\"&gt;political prisoner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vasyl%20Stus\"&gt;Vasyl Stus&lt;/a&gt; was living in apartment building at 13-a in that housing estate.\nIn 1982 due to increasing number of traffic lanes of Brest-Litovsky Highway, Sviatoshyn tram line was dismantled. Instead of trams, &lt;a href=\"trolleybus\"&gt;trolleybus&lt;/a&gt;es were launched to the neighbourhood.\nMemorial to Chernobyl disaster victims.\nThe is located in a landscape park at the intersection of and . The memorial is devoted to people who were killed, injured and suffered because of the &lt;a href=\"Chernobyl%20disaster\"&gt;Chernobyl disaster&lt;/a&gt; in 1986.\nThe monument to victims of that tragedy was erected at the initiative of the \"Chernobyl Disabled Union\" on 26 April 1994, with funds of the local budget and private donations. Authors of the monument are the &lt;a href=\"sculptor\"&gt;sculptor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"architect\"&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt; .\nIn 2001 the St church and in 2002 the bell tower museum were built at the monument.\nIn 2011 the memorial avenue \"Heroes of Chernobyl\" was created at the initiative of \"Chernobyl Fire-fighters\" &lt;a href=\"NGO\"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;. There were erected seven busts of firemen, &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Ukraine\"&gt;heroes of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and installed eight memorial plates in memory of died &lt;a href=\"Chernobyl%20liquidators\"&gt;Chernobyl disaster liquidators&lt;/a&gt;.\nVasyl Stus Garden Square.\n is located at the corner and . It is named after the poet and &lt;a href=\"political%20prisoner\"&gt;political prisoner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vasyl%20Stus\"&gt;Vasyl Stus&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of the most significant members of the Ukrainian cultural movement of the &lt;a href=\"sixtiers\"&gt;sixtiers&lt;/a&gt;. He was living near this place at 62 , since his marriage in 1965 to the first arrest in 1972. The house was demolished in 1979 due to building the &lt;a href=\"road%20interchange\"&gt;road interchange&lt;/a&gt; there.\nIn 2006 at the initiative of the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;Ukrainian People's Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NGO\"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;, a local community meeting was conducted, it was decided to establish Vasyl Stus garden square. The initiative coordinator was Viktor Tkachenko. In March 2007 the [[Kyiv City Council]] supported this initiative and local volunteers including students of schools 140 and 200, clean up the plot on [[Earth Day]]. However, in 2008 the [[Kyiv City State Administration]] gave a building permit for [[shopping centre]] construction here. Thus the building developer cut down more than 100 trees including [[oak]]s older than 120 years and [[pine]]s older than 150 years. The [[litigation]]s began between parties.\nFinally in 2010 the [[Kyiv City Council]] assigned \"Vasyl Stus\" name to this plot but in fact the garden square was opened on [[Kyiv Day]] of 2015 by the [[mayor of Kyiv]] [[Vitali Klitschko]]. There were Vasyl Stus's widow and his sister, who was a refugee from the [[Donetsk Oblast]] because of the [[war in Donbass]], granddaughter, friends-[[sixtiers]], public [[activist]]s and local community residents present in the ceremonial unveiling of the garden square.\nTransport.\n[[File:Zhytomyrska metro station Kiev 2010 04.jpg|thumb|Zhytomyrska metro station]]\n is a point which all [[electric multiple unit]] trains go through from Kyiv towards the North-West direction. Some [[passenger train]]s that run to [[Western Ukraine]] stop at Sviatoshyn station.\nThere is the bus station \"Dachna\" located at 142a Peremohy Avenue. Buses to [[European countries]] and Western Ukraine set off from here.\nThe [[Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line]] of the [[Kyiv Metro]] is laid underground in the neighbourhood.
