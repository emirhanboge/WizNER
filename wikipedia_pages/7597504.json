    "text": "Don Cameron MBE BSc MA MIEE D.Eng &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Scottish%20Geographical%20Society\"&gt;FRSGS&lt;/a&gt; (born 1939) is a &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hot%20air%20balloon\"&gt;balloonist&lt;/a&gt;, and later founder of &lt;a href=\"Cameron%20Balloons\"&gt;Cameron Balloons&lt;/a&gt;, the world's largest hot air balloon manufacturer. Don Cameron is one of the few &lt;a href=\"aeronauts\"&gt;aeronauts&lt;/a&gt; to be awarded the &lt;a href=\"Harmon%20Trophy\"&gt;Harmon Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, as the 'World's Outstanding Aviator' in 1999.\nEarly life and career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; in 1939, Cameron went to &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Glen%27s%20School\"&gt;Allan Glen's School&lt;/a&gt; and then went on to study &lt;a href=\"aeronautical%20engineering\"&gt;aeronautical engineering&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Glasgow\"&gt;University of Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, graduating in 1961. In 1963 he obtained a master's degree at &lt;a href=\"Cornell%20University\"&gt;Cornell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. He then joined the &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Aeroplane%20Company\"&gt;Bristol Aeroplane Company&lt;/a&gt;.\nCameron developed Britain's first modern &lt;a href=\"hot%20air%20balloon\"&gt;hot air balloon&lt;/a&gt; entitled \"&lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Belle\"&gt;Bristol Belle&lt;/a&gt;\" which flew for the first time at &lt;a href=\"Weston%20on%20the%20Green\"&gt;Weston on the Green&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oxfordshire\"&gt;Oxfordshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; on 9 July 1967. In 1968 Cameron and Leslie Goldsmith founded Omega Balloons which constructed ten balloons, before the company split into &lt;a href=\"Cameron%20Balloons\"&gt;Cameron Balloons&lt;/a&gt; and Western Balloons in 1970.\n&lt;a href=\"Cameron%20Balloons\"&gt;Cameron Balloons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, England, was formed by Cameron in 1971 - five years after he constructed his first balloon. The new company was based in &lt;a href=\"Cotham%2C%20Bristol\"&gt;Cotham, Bristol&lt;/a&gt; where a total of twenty nine balloons were made in the basement of the property. 1971 also saw Cameron build \"Golden Eagle\", a balloon designed specifically to fly across the &lt;a href=\"Sahara\"&gt;Sahara&lt;/a&gt; to shoot a film for &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Le%20Vien\"&gt;Jack Le Vien&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1978 his attempt to make the premier &lt;a href=\"Atlantic\"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; crossing by balloon ended when bad weather forced his heated &lt;a href=\"helium\"&gt;helium&lt;/a&gt; balloon \"Zanussi\" down after a 2,000-mile flight from Canada. It was piloted by Cameron and Christopher Davey. They left &lt;a href=\"St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;St. John's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/a&gt; on 26 July 1978, covered 1,780 miles, and ditched on 30 July 1978 in the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Biscay\"&gt;Bay of Biscay&lt;/a&gt; only 110 miles from &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; after a tear developed in the balloon. The two planned a second attempt, but discarded their plans when the \"&lt;a href=\"Double%20Eagle%20II\"&gt;Double Eagle II&lt;/a&gt;\" successfully made a &lt;a href=\"transatlantic%20flight\"&gt;transatlantic flight&lt;/a&gt; three weeks later. Cameron and Davey were awarded the Gold Medal of the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//royalaeroclub.co.uk/medals-and-awards.php%3Ftitle%3D%26amp%3Bid%3D54\"&gt;Royal Aero Club&lt;/a&gt; in the same year.\nNever averse to technical challenges, Cameron went on to write computer programmes to design specially shaped balloons.\nCameron has received the gold, silver and bronze medals of the British &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Aero%20Club\"&gt;Royal Aero Club&lt;/a&gt; for his ballooning achievements which include being the first man to cross the &lt;a href=\"Sahara\"&gt;Sahara&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alps\"&gt;Alps&lt;/a&gt; by hot-air balloon, and making the first flight between the UK and the former USSR in 1990.\n&lt;a href=\"Cameron%20Balloons\"&gt;Cameron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rozi%C3%A8re%20balloon\"&gt;Rozi\u00e8re balloon&lt;/a&gt;.\nLabeled the \"epitome of his achievement\" Don Cameron redesigned the helium and hot-air balloon combination into the Cameron Roziere balloon which reached multiple milestones. In 1992 Don Cameron fulfilled his transatlantic dream by designing and flying his Roziere balloon from &lt;a href=\"Bangor%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Bangor, Maine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, taking second place in the first ever &lt;a href=\"transatlantic%20balloon%20race\"&gt;transatlantic balloon race&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaking off from &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; and landing on 21 February 1995 in &lt;a href=\"Leader%2C%20Saskatchewan\"&gt;Leader, Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt;, flying a Cameron Roziere, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Fossett\"&gt;Steve Fossett&lt;/a&gt; became the first person to make a solo flight across the Pacific Ocean in a &lt;a href=\"balloon%20%28aircraft%29\"&gt;balloon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1999 a &lt;a href=\"Cameron%20Balloons\"&gt;Cameron Roziere balloon&lt;/a&gt; R-650, named the &lt;a href=\"Breitling%20Orbiter\"&gt;Breitling Orbiter&lt;/a&gt; 3, made the first non-stop flight round the world.\nDon Cameron and &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Cole%20%28balloonist%29\"&gt;Tim Cole&lt;/a&gt; designed and built the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Freedom%20%28balloon%29\"&gt;Spirit of Freedom (balloon)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rozi%C3%A8re%20balloon\"&gt;Rozi\u00e8re balloon&lt;/a&gt;. Cameron built the envelope and Cole the capsule. In 2002 solo &lt;a href=\"aviator\"&gt;aviator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Fossett\"&gt;Steve Fossett&lt;/a&gt; flew the Spirit of Freedom to become the first successful around the world nonstop solo flight in any kind of aircraft. On 19 June 2002 the 10-story high balloon \"Spirit of Freedom\" lifted off from &lt;a href=\"Northam%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Northam, Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; and landed in &lt;a href=\"Queensland%2C%20Australia\"&gt;Queensland, Australia&lt;/a&gt; on 3 July 2002 (&lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Independence Day&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;). The solo flight circumnavigation lasted 13 days, 8 hours, 33 minutes (14 days 19 hours 50 minutes to landing) and covered 20,626.48 statute miles (33,195.10\u00a0km). They (Fossett &amp; Spirit of Freedom) reached speeds of up to 322 kilometers (204 miles) per hour, and flew as high as 10,580 meters (34,700 feet)."
