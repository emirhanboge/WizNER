    "text": "Je\u2013Wel (initial name) and Jewel Records (without the dash, later name), was an independent American record label founded in &lt;a href=\"Odessa%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Odessa, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, in 1955 by &lt;a href=\"Weldon%20Rogers\"&gt;Weldon Rogers&lt;/a&gt; (1927\u20132004), himself a singer, and Chester Calvin Oliver (1907\u20132000). Je\u2013Wel is known for having engaged, recorded, and produced fledgling artists from &lt;a href=\"West%20Texas\"&gt;West Texas&lt;/a&gt; at the dawn of rock and roll in the 1950s.\nDisc.\nJe\u2013Wel's most notable production was a recording of The Teen Kings (with &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Orbison\"&gt;Roy Orbison&lt;/a&gt;) performing \"Ooby Dooby\". The session was recorded March 4, 1956, at &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Petty\"&gt;Norman Petty&lt;/a&gt;'s studio in &lt;a href=\"Clovis%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Clovis, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. \"Ooby Dooby\" was on the B side and \"&lt;a href=\"Tryin%27%20to%20Get%20to%20You\"&gt;Tryin' to Get to You&lt;/a&gt;\" was on the A Side. The record \u2013 manufactured in Phoenix, Arizona \u2013 was issued as JE-WEL 101 around March 16, 1956. According to the authorised biography of Roy Orbison, this was Orbison's first ever record release.\nJe\u2013Wel 101 is considered one of the world's rarest and most collectible rarities. It exists in both 78 and 45 rpm versions with at least three label variations: the first pressing misspells Roy's surname \"Oribson\" and many copies credit \"Trying to Get You\" instead of \"Trying to Get to You.'\nNaming and founding.\nJe\u2013Wel was formed to promote and record The Teen Kings. The name \"Je\u2013Wel\" was derived from the first letters of the middle name of Bobbie Jean Oliver (1939\u20132008) (daughter of co-founder Chester Oliver) and Weldon.\nBobbie Jean Oliver was a singer and accordion player with Western Melodiers, a band that backed up other local artists, including Weldon and Willie Rogers. Jean Oliver also frequently performed with the Teen Kings, although she was never a member. In 1993, Chester's wife, Acia, told John Ingman, a journalist with \"Now Dig This\", that it was Jean who had persuaded her parents to finance The Teen Kings' recordings, and that Rogers made little contribution. Weldon Rogers and Jean Oliver had been briefly married but quickly annulled it at the insistence of Jean's parents. Jean, later, had dated James Morrow, a member of The Teen Kings, who, when not appearing at the Archway Club in &lt;a href=\"Monahans%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Monahans, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, usually performed at the Saturday Night Jamboree in &lt;a href=\"Jal%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Jal, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. That is where James Morrow met and dated Jean Oliver. Jean's father, Chester, had worked for Phillips Petroleum, and the family lived in &lt;a href=\"Seminole%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Seminole, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaster tapes.\nThe Je\u2013Wel tape box was taken from Norman Petty's studio in &lt;a href=\"Clovis%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Clovis, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, to California by MCAs &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Hoffman%20%28audio%20engineer%29\"&gt;Steve Hoffman&lt;/a&gt; in 1984 and never returned. MCA had no rights to the tapes and has no knowledge of what happened to them.\nRelationship with Orbison.\nIn 1955, Orbison had arranged for Wink Westerners to perform on &lt;a href=\"KMID%20%28TV%29\"&gt;KMID&lt;/a&gt;, a TV station in Midland, Texas. Cecil \"Pop\" Holifield (1905\u20131974) also arranged for Johnny Cash to perform on the same program in early 1956. Holifield owned two record stores (\"The Record Shop\"), one in Odessa and one in Midland. Holifield had also promoted local concerts for Elvis and Cash and arranged TV performances, and regularly contributed articles to \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMidland, Texas is where Cash first heard The Teen Kings and met Orbison. Orbison attended a concert at &lt;a href=\"Midland%20High%20School%20%28Midland%2C%20Texas%29\"&gt;Midland High School&lt;/a&gt; on the evening of October 12, 1955, starring &lt;a href=\"Elvis%20Presley\"&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;/a&gt; and featuring &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Cash\"&gt;himself&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wanda%20Jackson\"&gt;Wanda Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Floyd%20Cramer\"&gt;Floyd Cramer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Porter%20Wagoner\"&gt;Porter Wagoner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Lord\"&gt;Bobby Lord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20C.%20Newman\"&gt;Jimmy C. Newman&lt;/a&gt;, and Jimmy Day (1934\u20131999). &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Walker%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Billy Walker&lt;/a&gt; also performed but was not named in the promotional materials. That afternoon, after a free promotional concert at Midland High School, Cash introduced Orbison to Elvis.\nJohnny Cash and Elvis Presley tried to persuade &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Phillips\"&gt;Sam Phillips&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Records\"&gt;Sun Records&lt;/a&gt; to give Orbison a contract. When Orbison made a follow-up call to Phillips, Phillips made it clear that no one, not even Johnny Cash, was going to dictate who did and did not get an audition on his record label. After what had happened to the careers of Presley and Cash, artists were coming to Sun in droves. Elvis, Cash, and Orbison had failed to persuade Phillips to sign Orbison.\nOn the day that Je\u2013Wel released The Teen Kings' single, Orbison took a copy to Cecil \"Pop\" Holifield (1905\u20131974). Holifield phoned Sam Phillips and played \"Ooby Dooby\" over the phone and told him it was \"sellin' big.\" He promised Phillips that he would never regret auditioning Orbison. A few days later, Phillips phoned Holifield to say that he wanted The Teen Kings in Memphis in three days to record for Sun Records.\nThe Teen Kings arrived in Memphis on Monday, March 19, 1956. When Phillips was made aware that Orbison was underage when he signed the contract with Je\u2013wel without parental consent on behalf of The Teen Kings, Phillips persuaded Orbison to sign a contract with Sun and Orbison's father co-signed. Phillips also got a court order to prevent Je\u2013wel from selling any more its records of Orbison, although, seemingly, another 5,000 copies were pressed with the assistance of Norman Petty. At this point, Chester Oliver had reach his threshold of tolerance and bowed-out of the partnership with Weldon.\nAccording to \"The Authorized Roy Orbison,\" on March 20, 1956, the Teen Kings re-recorded \"Ooby Dooby,\" \"Trying to Get to You\", and also recorded \"Go Go Go\" at Sun. &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Neal%20%28promoter%29\"&gt;Bob Neal&lt;/a&gt; (1917\u20131983) \u2014 owner of Stars, Incorporated, and Elvis Presley's first manager \u2014 signed the group to a booking and management contract. By June 1956 The Teen Kings had their first hits on the Sun label, the back-to-back singles \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Go Go Go.\" The Teen Kings toured southern venues that included dance halls and drive-in movies theaters, performing on the projection house roofs between film showings. They appeared with &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Perkins\"&gt;Carl Perkins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Cash\"&gt;Johnny Cash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Smith%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Warren Smith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Burgess\"&gt;Sonny Burgess&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faron%20Young\"&gt;Faron Young&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Horton\"&gt;Johnny Horton&lt;/a&gt;, and other country and &lt;a href=\"rockabilly\"&gt;rockabilly&lt;/a&gt; performers."
