    "text": "Aberystwyth () is a &lt;a href=\"university%20town\"&gt;university town&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"community%20%28Wales%29\"&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ceredigion\"&gt;Ceredigion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. Historically in the &lt;a href=\"Historic%20counties%20of%20Wales\"&gt;historic county&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cardiganshire\"&gt;Cardiganshire&lt;/a&gt;, the literal meaning of the word is \"the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Ystwyth\"&gt;Ystwyth&lt;/a&gt;\". In one form or another, &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20University\"&gt;Aberystwyth University&lt;/a&gt; has been a major educational location in Wales since the establishment of University College Wales in 1872.\nThe town is situated on &lt;a href=\"Cardigan%20Bay\"&gt;Cardigan Bay&lt;/a&gt; on the west coast of Wales, near the confluence of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Ystwyth\"&gt;River Ystwyth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Afon%20Rheidol\"&gt;Afon Rheidol&lt;/a&gt;. Following the reconstruction of the harbour, the Ystwyth skirts the town. The Rheidol passes through the town.\nThe seafront, with a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Pier%2C%20Aberystwyth\"&gt;pier&lt;/a&gt;, stretches from &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20Hill%2C%20Aberystwyth\"&gt;Constitution Hill&lt;/a&gt; at the north end of the Promenade to the harbour at the south. The beach is divided by the castle. The town is divided into five areas: Aberystwyth Town; &lt;a href=\"Llanbadarn%20Fawr%2C%20Ceredigion\"&gt;Llanbadarn Fawr&lt;/a&gt;; Waunfawr; Llanbadarn; Trefechan; and the most populous, &lt;a href=\"Penparcau\"&gt;Penparcau&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the 2001 census, the population of the town was 15,935. This reduced to 13,040 at the 2011 Census.\nIncluding the suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Llanbadarn%20Fawr%2C%20Ceredigion\"&gt;Llanbadarn Fawr&lt;/a&gt;, the population is 16,420, the built-up area having a population of 18,749.\nThe distance to &lt;a href=\"Swansea\"&gt;Swansea&lt;/a&gt; is ; to &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt; ; to &lt;a href=\"Wrexham\"&gt;Wrexham&lt;/a&gt; ; to &lt;a href=\"Cardiff\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt; ; and to London .\nMain features of the town.\nAberystwyth is a university town and tourist destination, and forms a cultural link between &lt;a href=\"North%20Wales\"&gt;North Wales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Wales\"&gt;South Wales&lt;/a&gt;. Constitution Hill, scaled by the &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Cliff%20Railway\"&gt;Aberystwyth Cliff Railway&lt;/a&gt;, gives access to panoramic views and to other attractions at the summit, including a &lt;a href=\"camera%20obscura\"&gt;camera obscura&lt;/a&gt;. Scenic &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Wales\"&gt;Mid Wales&lt;/a&gt; landscape within easy reach of the town includes the wilderness of the &lt;a href=\"Cambrian%20Mountains\"&gt;Cambrian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, whose valleys contain forests and meadows which have changed little in centuries. A convenient way to access the interior is by the preserved narrow-gauge &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Rheidol%20Railway\"&gt;Vale of Rheidol Railway&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the town is relatively modern, there are a number of historic buildings, including the remains of the &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; and the Old College of &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20University\"&gt;Aberystwyth University&lt;/a&gt; nearby. The Old College was originally built and opened in 1865 as a hotel, but after the owner's bankruptcy the shell of the building was sold to the university in 1867.\nThe new university campus overlooks Aberystwyth from Penglais Hill to the east of the town centre. The &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20railway%20station\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt;, a terminus of the main railway, was built in 1924 in the typical style of the period, mainly in a mix of &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Revival\"&gt;Classical Revival&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20architecture\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; architecture.\nThe town is the unofficial capital of Mid Wales, and several institutions have regional or national offices there. Public bodies located in the town include the &lt;a href=\"National%20Library%20of%20Wales\"&gt;National Library of Wales&lt;/a&gt;, which incorporates the &lt;a href=\"National%20Screen%20and%20Sound%20Archive%20of%20Wales\"&gt;National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales&lt;/a&gt;, one of six British regional film archives. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Commission%20on%20the%20Ancient%20and%20Historical%20Monuments%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales&lt;/a&gt; maintains and curates the &lt;a href=\"National%20Monuments%20Record%20of%20Wales\"&gt;National Monuments Record of Wales&lt;/a&gt; (NMRW), providing the public with information about the built heritage of Wales. Aberystwyth is also the home to the national offices of &lt;a href=\"UCAC\"&gt;UCAC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cymdeithas%20yr%20Iaith%20Gymraeg\"&gt;Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg&lt;/a&gt; (Welsh Language Society), and the site of the &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20Grassland%20and%20Environmental%20Research\"&gt;Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Books%20Council\"&gt;Welsh Books Council&lt;/a&gt; and the offices of the standard historical dictionary of Welsh, &lt;a href=\"Geiriadur%20Prifysgol%20Cymru\"&gt;Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru&lt;/a&gt;. A purpose built &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Government\"&gt;Welsh Government&lt;/a&gt; office and an adjoining office of &lt;a href=\"Ceredigion%20County%20Council\"&gt;Ceredigion County Council&lt;/a&gt; are also located in the town.\nClimate.\nAberystwyth experiences an &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20climate\"&gt;oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; \"Cfb\") similar to almost all of the United Kingdom. This is particularly pronounced due to its west coast location facing the Irish Sea. Air undergoes little land moderation and so temperatures closely reflect the sea temperature when winds are coming from the predominant onshore (westerly) direction. The nearest &lt;a href=\"Met%20Office\"&gt;Met Office&lt;/a&gt; weather station is &lt;a href=\"Gogerddan\"&gt;Gogerddan&lt;/a&gt;, 3 miles to the northeast, and at a similar elevation.\nThe absolute maximum temperature is , set during July 2006. This is also the July record maximum for all of Wales, suggesting that the area's low lying situation, aided by a possible &lt;a href=\"f%C3%B6hn\"&gt;f\u00f6hn&lt;/a&gt; effect when winds are offshore can act to achieve high temperatures on occasion. Typically the warmest day will average and 5.6 days will achieve a maximum of or above.\nThe absolute minimum temperature is , set in January 2010. Typically 39.8 days will register an air frost.\nRainfall averages a year, with over 1mm recorded on 161 days. All averages refer to the 1981\u20132010 period.\nHistory.\nMesolithic.\nThere is evidence that during the &lt;a href=\"Mesolithic\"&gt;Mesolithic&lt;/a&gt; Age the area of Tan-y-Bwlch at the foot of Pen Dinas (&lt;a href=\"Penparcau\"&gt;Penparcau&lt;/a&gt;) was used as a &lt;a href=\"flint%20knapping\"&gt;flint knapping&lt;/a&gt; floor for &lt;a href=\"hunter-gatherer\"&gt;hunter-gatherer&lt;/a&gt;s making weapons from flint that was deposited as the ice retreated.\nBronze and Iron Ages.\nThe remains of a &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; fortress on &lt;a href=\"Pen%20Dinas\"&gt;Pen Dinas&lt;/a&gt; (or more correctly 'Dinas Maelor'), a hill in &lt;a href=\"Penparcau\"&gt;Penparcau&lt;/a&gt; overlooking Aberystwyth, indicates that the site was inhabited before 700 BC. On a hill south of the present town, across the River Ystwyth, are the remains of a medieval &lt;a href=\"ringfort\"&gt;ringfort&lt;/a&gt; believed to be the castle from which &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Nest\"&gt;Princess Nest&lt;/a&gt; was abducted. This rare survival is now on private land and can only be accessed by arrangement.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe recorded history of Aberystwyth may be said to date from the building of a fortress in 1109 by &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Fitz%20Richard\"&gt;Gilbert Fitz Richard&lt;/a&gt; (grandfather of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20de%20Clare%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke\"&gt;Richard de Clare&lt;/a&gt;, known as Strongbow, the &lt;a href=\"Cambro-Norman\"&gt;Cambro-Norman&lt;/a&gt; lord notable for his leading role in the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20invasion%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Norman invasion of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;). Gilbert Fitz Richard was granted lands and the lordship of &lt;a href=\"Cardigan%2C%20Ceredigion\"&gt;Cardigan&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry I&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Cardigan%20Castle\"&gt;Cardigan Castle&lt;/a&gt;. The fortress built in Aberystwyth was located about a mile and a half south of today's town, on a hill over the south bank of the Ystwyth River, thus giving the settlement of Aberystwyth its name. The location is now known as Tan-Y-Castell.\nAberystwyth was usually under the control of the princes of &lt;a href=\"Deheubarth\"&gt;Deheubarth&lt;/a&gt;, but its position close to the border with &lt;a href=\"Gwynedd\"&gt;Gwynedd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Powys\"&gt;Powys&lt;/a&gt; left it vulnerable to attacks from the leaders of those polities. The town was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Gwenwynwyn%20ab%20Owain\"&gt;Gwenwynwyn ab Owain&lt;/a&gt; in 1197, an assault in which &lt;a href=\"Maelgwn%20ap%20Rhys\"&gt;Maelgwn ap Rhys&lt;/a&gt; was captured. &lt;a href=\"Llywelyn%20the%20Great\"&gt;Llywelyn the Great&lt;/a&gt; attacked and seized the town in late 1208, building a castle there before withdrawing.\n&lt;a href=\"Edward%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward I&lt;/a&gt; replaced Strongbow's castle in 1277, after its destruction by the Welsh. His castle was, however, built in a different location, at the current Castle Hill, the high point of the town. Between the years 1404 and 1408 &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Castle\"&gt;Aberystwyth Castle&lt;/a&gt; was in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Owain%20Glynd%C5%B5r\"&gt;Owain Glynd\u0175r&lt;/a&gt; but finally surrendered to Prince Harry (the future King &lt;a href=\"Henry%20V%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry V of England&lt;/a&gt;). Shortly after this, the town was incorporated under the title of Ville de Lampadarn (the ancient name of the place being Llanbadarn Gaerog or the fortified Llanbadarn, to distinguish it from Llanbadarn Fawr, the village one mile (1.6\u00a0km) inland. It is thus styled in a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20charter\"&gt;Royal charter&lt;/a&gt; granted by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; but, by &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Elizabeth I's&lt;/a&gt; time, the town was invariably named Aberystwyth in all documents.\nEarly modern era.\nFrom 1639 to 1642, silver coins were minted at &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Castle\"&gt;Aberystwyth Castle&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Mint\"&gt;Royal Mint&lt;/a&gt;, using silver from local mines. \u00a310,500 in currency was produced, equivalent to 2.5 million &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20English%20penny%20%281603%E2%80%931707%29\"&gt;silver pennies&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1649, Parliamentarian troops razed the castle, although portions of three towers still exist. In 1988, an excavation within the castle area revealed a complete male skeleton, deliberately buried. Though skeletons rarely survive in Wales' acidic soil, this skeleton was probably preserved by the addition of lime from the collapsed building. Affectionately known as \"Charlie\" and now housed in the &lt;a href=\"Ceredigion%20Museum\"&gt;Ceredigion Museum&lt;/a&gt; in the town, he probably dates from the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt; period, and is likely to have died during the Parliamentarian siege. His image is featured in one of nine mosaics created to adorn the castle's walls.\nRural industries and craftsmen were an important part of life in a country town. The local trade directory for 1830 shows that there were in Aberystwyth:\nTwenty &lt;a href=\"boot\"&gt;boot&lt;/a&gt; makers, eight bakers, two &lt;a href=\"Miller\"&gt;corn millers&lt;/a&gt;, eleven &lt;a href=\"carpenter\"&gt;carpenter&lt;/a&gt;s and joiners, one &lt;a href=\"cooper%20%28profession%29\"&gt;cooper&lt;/a&gt;, seven tailors, two &lt;a href=\"dressmaker\"&gt;dressmaker&lt;/a&gt;s, two straw hat makers, two &lt;a href=\"hat%20maker\"&gt;hat maker&lt;/a&gt;s, three &lt;a href=\"currier\"&gt;currier&lt;/a&gt;s, four &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;rs, two &lt;a href=\"tinsmith\"&gt;tinsmith&lt;/a&gt;s, six &lt;a href=\"maltster\"&gt;maltster&lt;/a&gt;s, two skinners, four &lt;a href=\"Tanner%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;tanners&lt;/a&gt;, eight &lt;a href=\"stonemason\"&gt;stonemason&lt;/a&gt;s, one &lt;a href=\"brewer\"&gt;brewer&lt;/a&gt;, four &lt;a href=\"Lime%20kiln\"&gt;lime burners&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href=\"shipwright\"&gt;shipwright&lt;/a&gt;s, three &lt;a href=\"wheelwright\"&gt;wheelwright&lt;/a&gt;s, five &lt;a href=\"cabinet%20maker\"&gt;cabinet maker&lt;/a&gt;s, one nail maker, one rope maker and one &lt;a href=\"sailmaker\"&gt;sail maker&lt;/a&gt;.\nVictorian era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cambrian%20Railways\"&gt;Cambrian Railways&lt;/a&gt; line from Machynlleth reached Aberystwyth in 1864, closely followed by rail links to &lt;a href=\"Carmarthen\"&gt;Carmarthen&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the construction of the town's impressive &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20railway%20station\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt;. The Cambrian line opened on &lt;a href=\"Good%20Friday\"&gt;Good Friday&lt;/a&gt; 1869, the same day that the new &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Pier%2C%20Aberystwyth\"&gt;Royal Pier&lt;/a&gt; (designed by &lt;a href=\"Eugenius%20Birch\"&gt;Eugenius Birch&lt;/a&gt;) opened, attracting 7,000 visitors.\nThe railway's arrival gave rise to something of a &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; tourist boom; the town was once even billed as the \"Biarritz of Wales\". During this time, a number of hotels and fine &lt;a href=\"townhouse\"&gt;townhouse&lt;/a&gt;s were built including the Queens Hotel, later renamed &lt;a href=\"Swyddfa%27r%20Sir\"&gt;Swyddfa'r Sir&lt;/a&gt; (County Office) when used as offices by the town council, and most recently used as the external scenes of the police station in the television show \"Hinterland\". One of the largest of these hotels, \"The Castle Hotel\", was never completed as a hotel but, following bankruptcy, was sold cheaply to the Welsh National University Committee, a group of people dedicated to the creation of a Welsh University. The University College of Wales (later to become Aberystwyth University) was founded in 1872 in this building.\nAberystwyth was a contributory &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20borough\"&gt;parliamentary borough&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Representation%20of%20the%20People%20Act%201884\"&gt;Third Reform Act&lt;/a&gt;, which merged its representation into that of the county in 1885.\nIn 1895, various businessmen who had been behind the Aberystwyth New Harbour Company formed the Aberystwyth Improvement Company (AIC) to take over the works of the defunct Bourne Engineering &amp; Electrical. In 1896, the AIC completed three projects: the new landside pavilion for the Royal Pier; built the Cambria Hotel (later the &lt;a href=\"United%20Theological%20College%2C%20Aberystwyth\"&gt;United Theological College&lt;/a&gt;) and formed &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20Hill%2C%20Aberystwyth\"&gt;Constitution Hill Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, to develop a Victorian &lt;a href=\"theme%20park\"&gt;theme park&lt;/a&gt;. Chief engineer &lt;a href=\"George%20Croydon%20Marks\"&gt;George Croydon Marks&lt;/a&gt; designed all the AIC developments, including the United Kingdom's second longest &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Cliff%20Railway\"&gt;funicular railway&lt;/a&gt;, which takes passengers up a 50% gradient to a park and &lt;a href=\"camera%20obscura\"&gt;camera obscura&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern history.\nAberystwyth hosted the &lt;a href=\"National%20Eisteddfod\"&gt;National Eisteddfod&lt;/a&gt; in 1865, 1916, 1952 and 1992.\nOn the night of Friday, 14 January 1938, a storm with estimated wind speeds of up to struck the town. Most of the promenade was destroyed, along with of the pier. Many properties on the seafront were damaged, with every property from the King's Hall north affected; those on Victoria Terrace suffered the greatest damage. Work commenced on a protective &lt;a href=\"coffer%20dam\"&gt;coffer dam&lt;/a&gt; which continued into 1940, with total costs of construction coming to \u00a370,000 (equivalent to \u00a32.5 million today).\n&lt;a href=\"Cymdeithas%20yr%20Iaith%20Gymraeg\"&gt;Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg&lt;/a&gt; (Welsh language Society) held their historic first protest on Trefechan Bridge in Aberystwyth, on 2 February 1963.\nThe first independent Welsh &lt;a href=\"evangelicalism\"&gt;Evangelical&lt;/a&gt; Church was established in Aberystwyth (see &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Movement%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Evangelical Movement of Wales&lt;/a&gt;).\nOn 1 March 2005, Aberystwyth was granted &lt;a href=\"Fairtrade%20Town\"&gt;Fairtrade Town&lt;/a&gt; status.\nIn March 2009 mayor &lt;a href=\"Sue%20Jones-Davies\"&gt;Sue Jones-Davies&lt;/a&gt;, who had played the role of Judith Iscariot in the film \"&lt;a href=\"Monty%20Python%27s%20Life%20of%20Brian\"&gt;Monty Python's Life of Brian&lt;/a&gt;\" (1979), organised a charity screening of the film. Principal actors &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Jones\"&gt;Terry Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Palin\"&gt;Michael Palin&lt;/a&gt; also attended. There is a popular, but incorrect, &lt;a href=\"urban%20myth\"&gt;urban myth&lt;/a&gt; that the town had banned the film (as some authorities did) when it was first released.\nDuring the aftermath storms from &lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20Dirk\"&gt;Cyclone Dirk&lt;/a&gt; on Friday 3 January 2014, the town was one of the worst hit in Wales. Properties on the adjoining promenade were then evacuated for the next five days, including 250 students from the University. Ceredigion Council appealed to the Welsh Assembly Government for funds, whilst &lt;a href=\"Natural%20Resources%20Wales\"&gt;Natural Resources Wales&lt;/a&gt; undertook surveys and emergency preventative measures.\nNorth Parade, Aberystwyth was reported to be the most expensive street in Wales in 2018, based on property prices.\nGovernance.\nAberystwyth's local government administration has a two-tier structure consisting of two separate councils. As local government is a devolved matter in Wales, the legislation for both Councils is a responsibility of the &lt;a href=\"Senedd%20Cymru%20%E2%80%93%20Welsh%20Parliament\"&gt;Senedd&lt;/a&gt;.\nTown Council.\n&lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Town%20Council\"&gt;Aberystwyth Town Council&lt;/a&gt; is the first tier of local government, which is the closest to the general public; there are 19 elected town councillors from five wards. The &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Town%20Council%232012%20election\"&gt;last elections&lt;/a&gt; were held on the 4 May 2017. The council is responsible for &lt;a href=\"Cycling%20infrastructure\"&gt;cycle paths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rights%20of%20way%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;public footpaths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Closed-circuit%20television\"&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20wireless%20network\"&gt;public Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bus%20stop\"&gt;bus shelters&lt;/a&gt;, parks, gardens (including the castle grounds and the skateboard park) and &lt;a href=\"Allotment%20%28gardening%29\"&gt;allotments&lt;/a&gt;. The council is a statutory body which is consulted regarding planning decisions in the town area and makes recommendations to the planning authority, &lt;a href=\"Ceredigion%20County%20Council\"&gt;Ceredigion County Council&lt;/a&gt;. The Town Council is also involved in &lt;a href=\"Leisure%20centre\"&gt;leisure&lt;/a&gt;, tourism, business (through providing more than half of Menter Aberystwyth's funding in grants), &lt;a href=\"Liquor%20license\"&gt;licence applications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Well-being\"&gt;wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"environmental%20health\"&gt;environmental health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Recycling%20bin\"&gt;recycling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Waste%20collection\"&gt;refuse collection&lt;/a&gt;.\nA borough council existed in Aberystwyth from 1832 and the &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20School%20Board\"&gt;Aberystwyth School Board&lt;/a&gt; was established in 1870.\nCounty Council.\nCeredigion County Council is another statutory body incorporated by &lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Act of Parliament&lt;/a&gt;. It is the second tier of local government in the area and is a &lt;a href=\"unitary%20authority\"&gt;unitary authority&lt;/a&gt; with a wide range of powers and responsibility. The Council deals with roads (except trunk roads), street lighting, some highways, social services, children and family care, schools and public libraries. Aberystwyth elects six of the 42 councillors in five separate wards (Bronglais, Central, North and &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Rheidol\"&gt;Rheidol&lt;/a&gt; wards elect one councillor each while &lt;a href=\"Penparcau\"&gt;Penparcau&lt;/a&gt; ward elects two).\nSenedd Cymru \u2013 Welsh Parliament.\nAberystwyth has five &lt;a href=\"Senedd%20Cymru%20%E2%80%93%20Welsh%20Parliament\"&gt;Senedd&lt;/a&gt; members, one of whom (&lt;a href=\"Elin%20Jones\"&gt;Elin Jones&lt;/a&gt;) was elected as a constituency MS for &lt;a href=\"Ceredigion%20%28Senedd%20Cymru%20constituency%29\"&gt;Ceredigion&lt;/a&gt;, and four who are elected on the regional list for &lt;a href=\"Mid%20and%20West%20Wales%20%28Senedd%20Cymru%20electoral%20region%29\"&gt;Mid and West Wales&lt;/a&gt;.\nUK Parliament.\nThe town is in the &lt;a href=\"Ceredigion%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Ceredigion&lt;/a&gt; constituency for elections to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;. Since June 2017, Aberystwyth's MP has been &lt;a href=\"Plaid%20Cymru\"&gt;Plaid Cymru&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Lake\"&gt;Ben Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nTown library.\nThe first ever public library in Aberystwyth was opened in Compton House, Pier Street on 13 October 1874. In 1882 the library was moved to the Assembly Rooms which were leased to the council for 21 years. The lease expired in 1903 and the library returned to Pier Street, this time to the Old Banking Library at the corner with Eastgate Street, although this was short lived.\nA &lt;a href=\"Carnegie%20library\"&gt;Carnegie library&lt;/a&gt; was built in Aberystwyth in 1905, with a grant of \u00a33,000. Located in Corporation Street, it was designed by the architect &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Payton\"&gt;Walter Payton&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of 48 who entered the competition to design the building. It was formally opened on 20 April 1906 by Mrs Vaughan Davies, wife of the local MP.\nThe town library moved to &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Aberystwyth Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;, now known as Canolfan Alun R.

Established in 1907, it is a &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Government%20sponsored%20bodies\"&gt;Welsh Government sponsored body&lt;/a&gt;. According to Cyril Evans, the library's centenary events co-ordinator, \"The library is considered to be one of the world's greatest libraries, and its international reputation is certainly something that all Welsh men and women are intensely ... proud of\".\n&lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; is the main medium of communication within the organisation; it aims to deliver all public services in Welsh and English.\nArts.\n&lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Arts%20Centre\"&gt;Aberystwyth Arts Centre&lt;/a&gt; is one of the largest and busiest arts centres in Wales. It encompasses a 312-seat theatre, 900-seat concert hall, 125-seat cinema, and has accompanied studio, galleries, plus public spaces which include cafes and a bar.\nArad Goch is an Arts Council funded community theatre and art gallery based in the town. The premises holds a theatre, gallery, several art studios and meeting rooms, and a darkroom.\nMusic.\nAberystwyth has a live music scene which has produced bands and artists such as:\nThe University Music Centre promotes a varied programme for instrumentalists, singers and listeners from the university and the wider community.\nThe University chamber choir, &lt;a href=\"The%20Elizabethan%20Madrigal%20Singers\"&gt;The Elizabethan Madrigal Singers&lt;/a&gt;, have been singing in the town since 1950 and continue to hold a number of concerts throughout the year.\nAberystwyth gives its name to a well known &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20%28hymn%20tune%29\"&gt;hymn tune&lt;/a&gt; composed by &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Parry\"&gt;Joseph Parry&lt;/a&gt;.\nSport.\n&lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20RFC\"&gt;Aberystwyth RFC&lt;/a&gt; is the local &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; club and acts as a &lt;a href=\"Farm%20team\"&gt;feeder club&lt;/a&gt; to professional side &lt;a href=\"Scarlets\"&gt;Scarlets&lt;/a&gt;. It was formed in 1947 and for the 2017/18 season played in the &lt;a href=\"WRU%20Division%20One%20West\"&gt;WRU Division One West&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Aberystwyth Town F.C.&lt;/a&gt; is a semi-professional football club that was formed in 1884. The team currently compete in the &lt;a href=\"Cymru%20Premier\"&gt;Cymru Premier&lt;/a&gt;, Wales' top division.\nThe town also has a cricket club which plays in local leagues, an athletics club (founded 1955), and boxing club in Penparcau. The town's golf course opened in 1911.\nWelsh language.\nCeredigion, the county in which Aberystwyth is located, is one of the four most Welsh-speaking counties in Wales and remained majority Welsh speaking until the 2011 census.\nHowever, since the town's growth as a seaside resort in the Victorian era, it has been more anglicised than its hinterland and the rest of the county in general. The university has also attracted many English-speaking students from England, non-Welsh speaking parts of Wales and elsewhere. The 1891 census recorded that, of the 6635 inhabitants who completed the language section, 3482 (52.5%) were bilingual, 1751 (26.4%) were Welsh monoglots, and 1402 people (21.1%) were returned as English monoglots. Ceredigion (then named Cardiganshire) as a whole was 95.2% Welsh-speaking and 74.5% monoglot Welsh. Although the town remained majority Welsh-speaking for many more decades, English had already replaced Welsh in certain domains, such as entertainment and tourism.\nBy 1961, only 50.0% of the town's population could speak Welsh, compared to 79.5% for Cardiganshire as a whole; by 1971, these numbers had fallen to 44.9% and 67.6% respectively.\nThe 2001 census reported that, in the seven wards of Aberystwyth, 39% of the residents self-identified as able to speak or read or write Welsh. This is lower than Ceredigion as a whole (54%) but higher than Wales overall (19%).\nEducation.\nSchools.\nAberystwyth has two &lt;a href=\"comprehensive%20school\"&gt;comprehensive school&lt;/a&gt;s serving the town and a wide rural area: &lt;a href=\"Ysgol%20Gyfun%20Gymunedol%20Penweddig\"&gt;Ysgol Gyfun Gymunedol Penweddig&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ysgol%20Penglais%20School\"&gt;Ysgol Penglais School&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgol Gyfun Gymunedol Penweddig uses Welsh as the primary language of tuition; Ysgol Penglais School teaches in English and in Welsh as a subject.\nAberystwyth University.\nAberystwyth is home to Aberystwyth University () whose predecessor, University College Wales, was founded in 1872 and renamed the 'University of Wales, Aberystwyth' in the mid-1990s. Prior to the college's establishment, Wales had very limited academic-degree capability through &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wales%2C%20Lampeter\"&gt;St David's College, Lampeter&lt;/a&gt; (founded in 1822, now the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wales%2C%20Trinity%20Saint%20David\"&gt;University of Wales, Trinity Saint David&lt;/a&gt;).\nTourism and local economy.\nAs well as having two cinemas and a &lt;a href=\"golf%20course\"&gt;golf course&lt;/a&gt;, the town's attractions include:\nThe all &lt;a href=\"organic%20farming\"&gt;organic&lt;/a&gt; dairy unit of &lt;a href=\"Rachel%27s%20Organic\"&gt;Rachel's Organic&lt;/a&gt; is based in Glan yr Afon, and is the largest private sector employer in Aberystwyth.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Cambrian%20News\"&gt;Cambrian News&lt;/a&gt;\" newspaper came to Aberystwyth from &lt;a href=\"Bala%2C%20Gwynedd\"&gt;Bala&lt;/a&gt; in 1870, after it was purchased by Sir John Gibson. Printed in &lt;a href=\"Oswestry\"&gt;Oswestry&lt;/a&gt;, in May 1880 the paper integrated operations in a former &lt;a href=\"Malthouse\"&gt;Malthouse&lt;/a&gt; in Mill Street. Owned by the Read family from 1926, in 1993 printing was contracted out, enabling the move of editorial staff to the current open-plan offices on Llanbadarn Fawr Science Park. On the death of Henry Read, the paper was purchased in 1999 by Sir &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Tindle\"&gt;Ray Tindle&lt;/a&gt;, whose company owns more than 200 weekly newspapers in Britain. Now printed in &lt;a href=\"Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29\"&gt;tabloid&lt;/a&gt; format, \"Cambrian News\" is the second-largest weekly-print circulation newspaper in Wales, with 24,000 copies in six regional editorial versions, read by 60,000 weekly readers. The circulation area of mid, west and north Wales covers .\nSince the TV series \"&lt;a href=\"Hinterland%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Hinterland&lt;/a&gt;\" has been filmed in and around Aberystwyth, the area is being promoted as an opportunity for tourists to visit filming locations; many are well publicised.\nTransport.\nRail.\n&lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20railway%20station\"&gt;Aberystwyth railway station&lt;/a&gt; is situated in the town centre and is the terminus of the scenic &lt;a href=\"Cambrian%20Line\"&gt;Cambrian Line&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Transport%20for%20Wales%20Rail\"&gt;Transport for Wales Rail&lt;/a&gt; operate a mostly hourly service (with some two-hour intervals) to via and &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Wales\"&gt;Mid Wales&lt;/a&gt;, with nearly all trains continuing to . Connecting services from provide a link to &lt;a href=\"Gwynedd\"&gt;Gwynedd&lt;/a&gt;'s west coast as far as , along the Cambrian Coast Line. There is no longer a southbound connection: the &lt;a href=\"Carmarthen%E2%80%93Aberystwyth%20line\"&gt;Carmarthen\u2013Aberystwyth line&lt;/a&gt; was closed in 1965 as part of the &lt;a href=\"Beeching%20cuts\"&gt;Beeching cuts&lt;/a&gt;.\nAberystwyth station is also the terminus of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Rheidol%20Railway\"&gt;Vale of Rheidol Railway&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"steam%20locomotive\"&gt;steam-operated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"narrow%20gauge%20railway\"&gt;narrow gauge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heritage%20railway\"&gt;heritage railway&lt;/a&gt;. Constructed between 1901 and 1902, it was intended to ship mineral cargo, primarily lead, from &lt;a href=\"Devil%27s%20Bridge%2C%20Ceredigion\"&gt;Devil's Bridge&lt;/a&gt; down to Aberystwyth for trans-shipment. By the time it was finished, lead mining was in a deep downturn andthanks to the Aberystwyth Improvement Companythe railway came to rely largely on the tourist industry, opening for passengers in December 1902. It still remains open for the summer season, with a journey of .\nIn 1896, the Aberystwyth Improvement Company formed Constitution Hill Ltd which, under the direction of chief engineer &lt;a href=\"George%20Croydon%20Marks\"&gt;George Croydon Marks&lt;/a&gt;, developed the United Kingdom's second longest &lt;a href=\"funicular\"&gt;funicular railway&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Cliff%20Railway\"&gt;Aberystwyth Cliff Railway&lt;/a&gt;, which takes passengers up a 50% gradient.\nBus.\nAberystwyth is a hub for the &lt;a href=\"TrawsCymru\"&gt;TrawsCymru&lt;/a&gt; bus network, with four routes serving the town:\nThere is a daily &lt;a href=\"National%20Express%20Coaches\"&gt;National Express&lt;/a&gt; coach, service 409 to &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Coach%20Station\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20Coach%20Station\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, along with local bus services within the town and into the surrounding area.\nRoad.\nThe &lt;a href=\"A44%20road\"&gt;A44&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A487%20road\"&gt;A487&lt;/a&gt; meet with much traffic between &lt;a href=\"North%20Wales\"&gt;North Wales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20West%20Wales\"&gt;South West Wales&lt;/a&gt; passing through the town. The &lt;a href=\"A4120%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;A4120&lt;/a&gt; links the A44 and A487 between &lt;a href=\"Llanbadarn%20Fawr%2C%20Ceredigion\"&gt;Llanbadarn Fawr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Penparcau\"&gt;Penparcau&lt;/a&gt;, allowing through traffic to bypass the town centre.\nThe &lt;a href=\"B4574%20road\"&gt;B4574&lt;/a&gt; mountain road linking the town to &lt;a href=\"Rhayader\"&gt;Rhayader&lt;/a&gt; is described by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Automobile%20Association\"&gt;AA&lt;/a&gt; as one of the ten most scenic drives in the world.\nPort.\nThe port of Aberystwyth, although it is small and relatively inconsequential today, used to be an important &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; entryway. It was used to ship locally, to Ireland and as a transatlantic departure point. Commercially, the once important &lt;a href=\"Cardiganshire\"&gt;Cardiganshire&lt;/a&gt; lead mines exported from this location.\nThe importance of maritime trade in the 19th century is reflected in the fact that a &lt;a href=\"Lifeboat%20%28rescue%29\"&gt;lifeboat&lt;/a&gt; has been based at Aberystwyth since 1843, when a boat powered by six oars was funded by public subscription and placed under the control of the harbourmaster. The RNLI took over the service in 1861 and established &lt;a href=\"Aberystwyth%20Lifeboat%20Station\"&gt;Aberystwyth Lifeboat Station&lt;/a&gt; which celebrated 150 years in 2011. The station uses the inshore lifeboat \"Spirit of Friendship\".\nFreedom of the Town.\nThe following people and military units have received the &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20of%20the%20City\"&gt;Freedom of the Town&lt;/a&gt; of Aberystwyth."
