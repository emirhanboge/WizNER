Alongside his brother and father, the Kohl family created the &lt;a href=\"Kohl%27s\"&gt;Kohl's department stores&lt;/a&gt; chain and Kohl went on to be president and CEO of &lt;a href=\"Kohl%27s\"&gt;Kohl's&lt;/a&gt;. Kohl is a former &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;United States Senator&lt;/a&gt; from Wisconsin and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;. Kohl is also the former owner of the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Bucks\"&gt;Milwaukee Bucks&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt;. He chose not to seek re-election in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Wisconsin%2C%202012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; and was succeeded by fellow Democrat &lt;a href=\"Tammy%20Baldwin\"&gt;Tammy Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life, education, and career.\nKohl was born and raised in Milwaukee, the son of Mary (n\u00e9e Hiken) and Max Kohl. His father was a Polish Jewish immigrant and his mother was a Russian Jewish immigrant. He attended &lt;a href=\"Washington%20High%20School%20%28Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin%29\"&gt;Washington High School&lt;/a&gt;. He earned a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Science\"&gt;Bachelor of Science&lt;/a&gt; degree from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin\"&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; in 1956 and a &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Business%20Administration\"&gt;Master of Business Administration&lt;/a&gt; degree from &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Business%20School\"&gt;Harvard Business School&lt;/a&gt; in 1958. While an undergraduate, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Pi%20Lambda%20Phi\"&gt;Pi Lambda Phi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fraternity\"&gt;fraternity&lt;/a&gt;. He was also a roommate of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20Commissioner\"&gt;Major League Baseball Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bud%20Selig\"&gt;Bud Selig&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1958 and 1964, Kohl was a member of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Reserve\"&gt;United States Army Reserve&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing graduate school, Kohl worked as an investor in real estate and the stock market, eventually spinning off his own company, Kohl Investments, to manage these assets. He and his brother became heir to a family-owned chain that included 50 grocery stores and several department stores, pharmacies and liquor stores. In 1970, Kohl was named president of &lt;a href=\"Kohl%27s\"&gt;Kohl's&lt;/a&gt; and served until the corporation was sold to &lt;a href=\"BATUS%20Inc.\"&gt;BATUS Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (formerly British American Tobacco).\nKohl purchased the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Bucks\"&gt;Milwaukee Bucks&lt;/a&gt; from Jim Fitzgerald in 1985 for $18 million to ensure the team remained in Milwaukee. In 2003, he considered an offer to sell the team to former NBA superstar &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Jordan\"&gt;Michael Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, but decided to retain ownership. On April 16, 2014, Kohl agreed to sell the Bucks for $550 million to New York-based billionaires &lt;a href=\"Wes%20Edens\"&gt;Wesley Edens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marc%20Lasry\"&gt;Marc Lasry&lt;/a&gt;. Kohl was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20Athletic%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. On July 22, 2021, Kohl was the key figure of the lead car in the Milwaukee Bucks NBA Championship parade. On the event, he said \u201cThis is one of the big days of my life.\u201d Kohl attended the Bucks' 2021-22 season opener at &lt;a href=\"Fiserv%20Forum\"&gt;Fiserv Forum&lt;/a&gt; and was presented with a Bucks championship ring for his efforts in keeping the Bucks in Milwaukee.\nEarly political career.\nKohl served as Chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; between 1975 and 1977.\nPolitical positions.\nKohl has been described as a populist-leaning liberal.\nKohl supported President Barack Obama's health reform legislation; he voted for the &lt;a href=\"Patient%20Protection%20and%20Affordable%20Care%20Act\"&gt;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt; in December 2009, and he voted for the &lt;a href=\"Health%20Care%20and%20Education%20Reconciliation%20Act%20of%202010\"&gt;Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010&lt;/a&gt;.\nFiscal policy.\nHe has voted in favor of most lawsuit reform measures as well as for rules tightening &lt;a href=\"personal%20bankruptcy\"&gt;personal bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;. He has long supported amending the U.S. Constitution to require a &lt;a href=\"balanced%20budget\"&gt;balanced budget&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the few &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; to vote for the &lt;a href=\"tax%20cut\"&gt;tax cut&lt;/a&gt; passed in 2001, and he also supported the elimination of the \"&lt;a href=\"marriage%20penalty\"&gt;marriage penalty&lt;/a&gt;.\" Despite these views, he has been seen as generally supportive of &lt;a href=\"progressive%20taxation\"&gt;progressive taxation&lt;/a&gt;. Like many moderate Democrats, he voted in favor of the &lt;a href=\"welfare%20reform\"&gt;welfare reform&lt;/a&gt; measures in the mid-1990s. He is also not opposed to the creation of individual, private savings accounts to supplement &lt;a href=\"Social%20Security%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Social Security&lt;/a&gt;.\nKohl has generally had a pro-environmental record and has been an outspoken proponent of American energy independence. He supports increased production of hydrogen cars, establishing a federal goal for reducing oil consumption by 40 percent, and disallowing oil speculation in protected areas. However, he has voted against &lt;a href=\"Corporate%20Average%20Fuel%20Economy\"&gt;Corporate Average Fuel Economy&lt;/a&gt; standards. Kohl has been rated highly by groups that desire &lt;a href=\"universal%20health%20care\"&gt;universal health care&lt;/a&gt;. He has voted in favor of expanding &lt;a href=\"Medicare%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SCHIP\"&gt;SCHIP&lt;/a&gt; and has desired that prescription drugs be included under federal health coverage. During his 2006 re-election campaign, Kohl advocated that &lt;a href=\"HMO\"&gt;HMO&lt;/a&gt;s be placed under more scrutiny in order to determine if they're effectively delivering care.\nSocial policy.\nKohl is strongly &lt;a href=\"pro-choice\"&gt;pro-choice&lt;/a&gt; and opposes the &lt;a href=\"death%20penalty\"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt;. He is highly in favor of &lt;a href=\"affirmative%20action\"&gt;affirmative action&lt;/a&gt; and supports setting aside funds for women and minorities. Although he voted in favor of the 1996 &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Marriage%20Act\"&gt;Defense of Marriage Act&lt;/a&gt;, Kohl rejected the proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman and has supported measures that ban &lt;a href=\"discrimination\"&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href=\"sexual%20orientation\"&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;. Kohl has consistently voted against the &lt;a href=\"flag%20desecration%20amendment\"&gt;flag desecration amendment&lt;/a&gt; and in recent years has voted against restrictions on travel to &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and funding for &lt;a href=\"TV%20Mart%C3%AD\"&gt;TV Mart\u00ed&lt;/a&gt;. In 2005, he secured a victory for one of his main causes: requiring handguns to be sold with &lt;a href=\"child%20safety%20lock\"&gt;child safety lock&lt;/a&gt;s. The amendment was attached to the &lt;a href=\"Protection%20of%20Lawful%20Commerce%20in%20Arms%20Act\"&gt;Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act&lt;/a&gt;, with every Democrat and many Republicans voting in favor of the amendment. Earlier in his career, he helped push the &lt;a href=\"Gun-Free%20School%20Zones%20Act%20of%201990\"&gt;Gun-Free Schools Act&lt;/a&gt; which the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; overturned in 1995 and has submitted many amendments to that effect. He is a strong supporter of public education and has rejected &lt;a href=\"school%20vouchers\"&gt;school vouchers&lt;/a&gt;. Kohl has voted in favor of allowing for the establishment of educational savings accounts.\nForeign policy.\nKohl has voted against many &lt;a href=\"free%20trade\"&gt;free trade&lt;/a&gt; agreements including the &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement\"&gt;North American Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (NAFTA) and more recently the &lt;a href=\"Central%20America%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement\"&gt;Central America Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (CAFTA) and voted against the &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20to%20Farm%20Act\"&gt;Freedom to Farm Act&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. However, he has also supported fast-tracking trade normalization with &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and establishing free trade with some smaller countries of the &lt;a href=\"developing%20world\"&gt;developing world&lt;/a&gt;. He voted against authorizing the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20War\"&gt;Gulf War&lt;/a&gt; in 1990; however, he voted in 2002 to authorize military force in &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Kohl has voted on a number of occasions with more &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; Democrats to reduce military spending, voting against 1996 defense appropriations increases and supporting a veto of funding new military projects. Despite having been among the 98 U.S. Senators who voted for the &lt;a href=\"PATRIOT%20Act\"&gt;PATRIOT Act&lt;/a&gt;, Kohl subsequently opposed this legislation and has voted to require warrants for &lt;a href=\"wiretapping\"&gt;wiretapping&lt;/a&gt; or the detention of prisoners.\nPolitical campaigns.\nKohl won election to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Wisconsin%2C%201988\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt; with his trademark catchphrase \"Nobody's Senator But Yours\". He was re-elected in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Wisconsin%2C%201994\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Wisconsin%2C%202000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Wisconsin%2C%202006\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. He did not seek re-election in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Wisconsin%2C%202012\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nKohl is the wealthiest resident of Milwaukee, the richest Jewish American from Wisconsin, and was one of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20richest%20American%20politicians\"&gt;wealthiest U.S. Senators&lt;/a&gt;. In 2016, \"Forbes\" estimated Kohl's net worth to be around $630 million to $1.5 billion.\nOn May 13, 2011, Kohl announced he would not run for re-election in 2012, saying, \"The office doesn't belong to me. It belongs to the people of Wisconsin, and there is something to be said for not staying in office too long.\"\nOn July 22, 2021, Kohl was the key figure of the lead car in the Milwaukee Bucks NBA Championship parade. On the event, he said \u201cThis is one of the big days of my life.\u201d\nPhilanthropy.\nKohl donated $25 million to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison&lt;/a&gt; for construction of its new sports arena, which was named the &lt;a href=\"Kohl%20Center\"&gt;Kohl Center&lt;/a&gt;. In 1990, Kohl established the Herb Kohl Educational Foundation Achievement Award Program, which provides annual grants totaling $400,000 to 200 graduating seniors, 100 teachers and 100 schools throughout Wisconsin. In 2016, he gave $1.5 million to the La Follette School of Public Affairs to create the Herb Kohl Public Service Research Competition, promoting public policy research."
