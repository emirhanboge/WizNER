    "text": "Magiritsa () is a &lt;a href=\"Greek%20cuisine\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"soup\"&gt;soup&lt;/a&gt; made from &lt;a href=\"domestic%20sheep\"&gt;lamb&lt;/a&gt; offal, associated with the &lt;a href=\"Easter\"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt; (Pascha) tradition of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Greek Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;. Accordingly, Greek-Americans and Greek-Canadians sometimes call it \"Easter soup\", \"Easter Sunday soup\", or \"Easter lamb soup\". In some parts of Greece, most notably &lt;a href=\"Thessaly\"&gt;Thessaly&lt;/a&gt;, it is not served as soup but rather as a &lt;a href=\"fricassee\"&gt;fricassee&lt;/a&gt;, where it contains only offal and large variety of vegetables, but no onions or rice, as in the soup.\nTraditional use.\nMagiritsa is eaten to break the &lt;a href=\"fasting\"&gt;fast&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Greek Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lent\"&gt;Great Lent&lt;/a&gt;, the 40 days before Easter. Its role and ingredients result from its association with the roasted lamb traditionally served at the Paschal meal; in its traditional form, magiritsa consists of the offal removed from the lamb before roasting, flavored with seasonings and sauces. Prepared on &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Saturday\"&gt;Holy Saturday&lt;/a&gt; along with the next day's lamb, magiritsa is consumed immediately after the midnight Divine Liturgy.\nIngredients and preparation.\nWhile traditional magiritsa includes all the lamb offal available, it is the &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"neck\"&gt;neck&lt;/a&gt; of the lamb which provide most of the soup's flavor, and those parts, along with the &lt;a href=\"intestines\"&gt;intestines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"heart\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"liver\"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt;, are most commonly used today.\nAfter a thorough cleaning, the lamb parts are boiled whole in water for between thirty minutes and two hours, then cut up into smaller pieces, flavored with &lt;a href=\"onions\"&gt;onions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dill\"&gt;dill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"butter\"&gt;butter&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes &lt;a href=\"vegetables\"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, and left to &lt;a href=\"simmer\"&gt;simmer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rice\"&gt;Rice&lt;/a&gt; is added towards the end of the boiling process, and the stock is thickened with &lt;a href=\"avgolemono\"&gt;avgolemono&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen consumed in the early hours of the Paschal morning after church, magiritsa is sometimes accompanied by &lt;a href=\"salad\"&gt;salad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tsoureki\"&gt;tsoureki&lt;/a&gt; sweet bread, and hard-boiled &lt;a href=\"egg%20%28food%29\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; dyed red as a symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Resurrection%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;risen Christ&lt;/a&gt;'s blood."
