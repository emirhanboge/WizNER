    "text": "\"Ego Death\" is a song by American singer &lt;a href=\"Ty%20Dolla%20Sign\"&gt;Ty Dolla Sign&lt;/a&gt; from his third studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Featuring%20Ty%20Dolla%20Sign\"&gt;Featuring Ty Dolla Sign&lt;/a&gt;\" (2020). The song features guest appearances from American rapper &lt;a href=\"Kanye%20West\"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt;, English singer-songwriter &lt;a href=\"FKA%20Twigs\"&gt;FKA Twigs&lt;/a&gt;, and American DJ &lt;a href=\"Skrillex\"&gt;Skrillex&lt;/a&gt;. It contains additional vocals by &lt;a href=\"Serpentwithfeet\"&gt;Serpentwithfeet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Davis\"&gt;Angela Davis&lt;/a&gt;, and Jariuce \"Jehreeus\" Banks. Ty Dolla Sign, Skrillex, and BoogzDaBeast produced the song. According to the first of the three producers, it expands on West's \"&lt;a href=\"Fade%20%28Kanye%20West%20song%29\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt;\". Initially previewed after the &lt;a href=\"Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival\"&gt;Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival&lt;/a&gt; in April 2019, the former experienced an &lt;a href=\"internet%20leak\"&gt;internet leak&lt;/a&gt; in March 2020. It was later released for &lt;a href=\"Music%20download\"&gt;digital download&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Streaming%20media\"&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"lead%20single\"&gt;lead single&lt;/a&gt; from the album on July 1, 2020, through &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Records\"&gt;Atlantic Records&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; number, \"Ego Death\" has &lt;a href=\"electro-hop\"&gt;electro-hop&lt;/a&gt; elements. The song &lt;a href=\"Sampling%20%28music%29\"&gt;samples&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ralphi%20Rosario\"&gt;Ralphi Rosario&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"You%20Used%20to%20Hold%20Me%20%28Ralphi%20Rosario%20song%29\"&gt;You Used to Hold Me&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Nat%C3%A9\"&gt;Ultra Nat\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Free%20%28Ultra%20Nat%C3%A9%20song%29\"&gt;Free&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Latifah\"&gt;Queen Latifah&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Dance for Me\". Lyrically, it centers on &lt;a href=\"ego%20death\"&gt;ego death&lt;/a&gt;. The song received generally positive reviews from &lt;a href=\"Music%20journalism\"&gt;music critics&lt;/a&gt;, who mostly praised West's verse. Some were appreciative of FKA Twigs' feature, while other critics complimented the chemistry of the aforementioned two, Ty Dolla Sign, and Skrillex. The song reached number seven on the US &lt;a href=\"Bubbling%20Under%20Hot%20100\"&gt;Bubbling Under Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; chart, published by \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\", while peaking within the top 50 of the main charts in Ireland and the United Kingdom. An accompanying &lt;a href=\"lyric%20video\"&gt;lyric video&lt;/a&gt; was released on July 20, 2020, which is &lt;a href=\"Anime\"&gt;animated&lt;/a&gt; and features the performers in cartoon form. They act out lyrics from the song in the video, being accompanied by varying tokens.\nBackground and recording.\nTy Dolla Sign and &lt;a href=\"Kanye%20West\"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt; had previously collaborated for numerous songs, including \"&lt;a href=\"Only%20One%20%28Kanye%20West%20song%29\"&gt;Only One&lt;/a&gt;\" (2014), \"&lt;a href=\"Real%20Friends%20%28Kanye%20West%20song%29\"&gt;Real Friends&lt;/a&gt;\" (2016), and \"&lt;a href=\"Everything%20We%20Need\"&gt;Everything We Need&lt;/a&gt;\" (2019). The former had also worked with &lt;a href=\"Skrillex\"&gt;Skrillex&lt;/a&gt; on multiple songs, including the 2019 releases \"Two Nights Part II\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Hour%20%28Skrillex%2C%20Boys%20Noize%20and%20Ty%20Dolla%20Sign%20song%29\"&gt;Midnight Hour&lt;/a&gt;\"; that same year, he collaborated with American &lt;a href=\"Experimental%20music\"&gt;experimental&lt;/a&gt; musician &lt;a href=\"Serpentwithfeet\"&gt;Serpentwithfeet&lt;/a&gt; on \"Receipts\". Unlike the others, \"Ego Death\" was &lt;a href=\"FKA%20Twigs\"&gt;FKA Twigs&lt;/a&gt;' first track with Ty Dolla Sign. Skrillex had collaborated with FKA Twigs in the past, while his work with West prior to the latter's sixth studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Yeezus\"&gt;Yeezus&lt;/a&gt;\" (2013) was postponed. The track was produced by Ty Dolla Sign, Skrillex, and BoogzDaBeast.\nIn April 2019, Ty Dolla Sign previewed the song at a &lt;a href=\"Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival\"&gt;Coachella Festival&lt;/a&gt; after-party in dedication to &lt;a href=\"420%20%28cannabis%20culture%29\"&gt;420&lt;/a&gt; by performing a &lt;a href=\"Demo%20%28music%29\"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; version, while vocals from West were also played by the party's DJ. In August 2019, \"&lt;a href=\"Spin%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that Ty Dolla Sign planned to release \"Ego Death\" as the &lt;a href=\"lead%20single\"&gt;lead single&lt;/a&gt; for his then-upcoming album. According to him, the song expands on West's 2016 &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Fade%20%28Kanye%20West%20song%29\"&gt;Fade&lt;/a&gt;\", which he appears on. In March 2020, the song &lt;a href=\"Internet%20leak\"&gt;leaked online&lt;/a&gt;. Ty Dolla Sign shared a teaser for the song on June 30, 2020, unveiling the collaborators. He issued a &lt;a href=\"press%20release\"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; the next day, labeling the song highly special and showing admiration in working with \"a genius\" in West, who he makes \"incredible records\" with every time. Ty Dolla Sign further stated that Skrillex and FKA Twigs provided a blessing with the magic only they are capable of delivering, while recalling everyone having gone crazy when he played the song at a house party. The singer revealed he was not offended when the song leaked, admitting that he merely \"had to find the right time\" for its release and felt \"excited that it's finally THAT TIME!\" Ty Dolla Sign partnered with the company &lt;a href=\"Triller%20%28app%29\"&gt;Triller&lt;/a&gt; to create a 9D experience for the listener with the song, marking \"the first-ever of its kind\" in July 2020.\nIn an interview with &lt;a href=\"Zane%20Lowe\"&gt;Zane Lowe&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Music%201\"&gt;Beats 1&lt;/a&gt;, Ty Dolla Sign detailed the origins of \"Ego Death\". He vaguely recalled overhearing women at a party discussing the &lt;a href=\"ego%20death\"&gt;ego death&lt;/a&gt; of a man, considering the concept to be \"hard\". Ty Dolla Sign said he then had the idea of the song, subsequently making its beat and watching an &lt;a href=\"Instagram\"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; video of West walking through &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; that includes him commenting on a passing train. The former regarded the comment as being \"so hard\", thus &lt;a href=\"Sampling%20%28music%29\"&gt;sampling&lt;/a&gt; it on the song. Ty Dolla Sign stated that he then went to the city to record for West's then-upcoming album \"Yandhi\", which was later scrapped and became his ninth studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Is%20King\"&gt;Jesus Is King&lt;/a&gt;\" (2019). The singer went on to reveal that he played \"Ego Death\" to West, \"and he went crazy\". He admitted that all the people in the room \"ran out, like, 'Oh, shit'\", followed by West using the microphone to beatbox and freestyle. Ty Dolla Sign added that he traveled to London to collaborate with FKA Twigs, before Skrillex worked on the track in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;; the singer affirmed the recording \"was definitely a process\".\nComposition and lyrics.\nMusically, \"Ego Death\" is a &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; number, with elements of &lt;a href=\"electro-hop\"&gt;electro-hop&lt;/a&gt;. It was compared by numerous publications to \"Fade\". The song prominently samples the 1987 house record \"&lt;a href=\"You%20Used%20to%20Hold%20Me%20%28Ralphi%20Rosario%20song%29\"&gt;You Used to Hold Me&lt;/a&gt;\" by American producer &lt;a href=\"Ralphi%20Rosario\"&gt;Ralphi Rosario&lt;/a&gt;. The opening utilizes a sample of fellow house track \"&lt;a href=\"Free%20%28Ultra%20Nat%C3%A9%20song%29\"&gt;Free&lt;/a&gt;\" (1997) by recording artist &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Nat%C3%A9\"&gt;Ultra Nat\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, which is followed by the song's bass &lt;a href=\"Chord%20progression\"&gt;bass progression&lt;/a&gt;. A sample of \"Dance for Me\" (1989) by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Latifah\"&gt;Queen Latifah&lt;/a&gt; is also included on the song, appearing alongside FKA Twigs' vocals. The song is built on a sparse four-note bass progression, while its beat features the same &lt;a href=\"Loop%20%28music%29\"&gt;loop&lt;/a&gt; as West's &lt;a href=\"Lil%20Pump\"&gt;Lil Pump&lt;/a&gt; collaboration \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Love%20It%20%28Kanye%20West%20and%20Lil%20Pump%20song%29\"&gt;I Love It&lt;/a&gt;\" (2018). 9D is utilized on the song to create additional effects such as &lt;a href=\"Reverberation\"&gt;reverb&lt;/a&gt;, which enables the listener to have the sensation of the music moving around in their headphones. A thumping &lt;a href=\"bassline\"&gt;bassline&lt;/a&gt; and speedy &lt;a href=\"Percussion%20instrument\"&gt;percussion&lt;/a&gt; are also included, alongside the vocals being covered in &lt;a href=\"funk\"&gt;funk&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the start of his verse, the song takes a sample of an Instagram video from West; it begins from the 1:50 mark of the video and features him saying \"Hold on, this train going by\". Ty Dolla Sign delivers the &lt;a href=\"Refrain\"&gt;chorus&lt;/a&gt;, on which he sings and &lt;a href=\"Crooner\"&gt;croons&lt;/a&gt; in a calm tone. The singer is followed by West, who raps a verse. Serpentwithfeet performs on the interlude, while additional vocals are also contributed to the song by political activist &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Davis\"&gt;Angela Davis&lt;/a&gt; and music composer Jariuce \"Jehreeus\" Banks. FKA Twigs is the last performer on the song, singing its short outro.\nThe lyrics of the song focus on ego death, echoing its title. Ty Dolla Sign sings about the subject, referencing a faltered relationship and his consideration of dismissing self-centered concerns. The singer details his ex-lover leaving him, crooning that she \"hurt\" and \"murdered\" his ego when she \"walked away\". Ty Dolla Sign mentions the \"Ego death is where you find happiness\" theme, performing the line and succeeding it with, \"That's the only place you find happiness.\" West criticizes the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award\"&gt;Grammys&lt;/a&gt;, and what he classes as \"halfway movements\", as well as addressing &lt;a href=\"birth%20control\"&gt;birth control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voter%20suppression\"&gt;black voter suppression&lt;/a&gt;. The rapper brags about becoming a billionaire: \"Just hit a billi, he gone on 'em\". Serpentwithfeet performs in the background, delivering the line \"Your joy isn't tied to me\". On the outro, FKA Twigs sings about letting her \"ego down\" before it makes a comeback.\nRelease and promotion.\n\"Ego Death\" was released for &lt;a href=\"Music%20download\"&gt;digital download&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Streaming%20media\"&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; in various countries as the lead single from \"Featuring Ty Dolla Sign\" on July 1, 2020, a day after West released his own single \"&lt;a href=\"Wash%20Us%20in%20the%20Blood\"&gt;Wash Us in the Blood&lt;/a&gt;\". The song was later serviced to US &lt;a href=\"rhythmic%20contemporary\"&gt;rhythmic contemporary&lt;/a&gt; radio stations on July 28, 2020. On October 23, 2020, \"Ego Death\" was included as the twenty-fifth and final track on Ty Dolla Sign's third studio album \"Featuring Ty Dolla Sign\". Simultaneously with the single release, an accompanying &lt;a href=\"Anime\"&gt;animated&lt;/a&gt; visualizer was shared.\nAn animated &lt;a href=\"lyric%20video\"&gt;lyric video&lt;/a&gt; for \"Ego Death\" was released on July 20, 2020, which was directed by &lt;a href=\"motion%20graphics\"&gt;motion graphics&lt;/a&gt; artist Emonee LaRussa. The artist handled the animation alongside 10 animators, while three character designers also helped create the video. It is a psychedelic &lt;a href=\"Aesthetics\"&gt;aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, which features cartoon versions of the song's performers and utilizes a &lt;a href=\"kaleidoscope\"&gt;kaleidoscope&lt;/a&gt; effect. Different personalities are conveyed by them: Ty Dolla Sign appears blood-red and stoned, West is hyper and overly busy, FKA Twigs performs the &lt;a href=\"martial%20arts\"&gt;martial arts&lt;/a&gt; that stage performances of hers were inspired by. As the characters act them out, the lyrics are projected on a field of stars. Tokens appear throughout the video, including ones that are connected to relationships, the Grammys, and internal struggles. A woman slits Ty Dolla Sign's throat, symbolizing his ego being killed. The characters can be seen licking &lt;a href=\"Neon%20lighting\"&gt;neon&lt;/a&gt; blood off knives and tripping over magic mushrooms at points, and content that West raps about comes to life.\nCritical reception.\n\"Ego Death\" was met with generally positive reviews from &lt;a href=\"Music%20journalism\"&gt;music critics&lt;/a&gt;, with them mostly singling out West's vocals for praise. In a strongly positive review, \"&lt;a href=\"Clash%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Clash&lt;/a&gt;\"s Robin Murray asserted that the song is \"basically an \"&lt;a href=\"Avengers%20Assemble%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Avengers Assemble&lt;/a&gt;\" kinda deal\", characterizing Ty Dolla Sign as having \"gone straight to the top\" with \"an incredible creative team\" he assembled. Murray elaborated by writing that a \"resurgent Kanye West\", Skrillex's \"wild, lawless\", exaggerated \"futurism\", and FKA Twigs' position of a \"true auteur\" all being present on the song amount to being advantageous, concluding by labelling it \"a stunner\". In \"&lt;a href=\"Paper%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Paper&lt;/a&gt;\", Logan Potter questioned if the song is \"the most powerful collaboration of 2020\", lauding Ty Dolla Sign and the featured artists' \"stylistic choices\". He explained, citing how FKA Twigs has \"a fiery &lt;a href=\"Pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; outro\", West returns to his signature sound from before \"Jesus Is King\", and Ty Dolla Sign demonstrates impressive lyrical ability. Brenton Blanchet of \"&lt;a href=\"Spin%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt;\" opined that \"Ego Death\" \"could best be described as the second coming\" of \"Fade\", assuring the combination of samples only West or Skrillex can put together, the \"(probably) bouncy instrumental\" to the latter song, West's verse, and FKA Twigs' \"magic touch\" lead to the song being \"a flex of [Ty Dolla Sign's] connections just as much as it's a flex of his &lt;a href=\"Hoarse\"&gt;raspy&lt;/a&gt; vocals\".\nWriting for \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\", Carl Lamarre said that the track conveys an \"electro-hop feel\" as Ty Dolla Sign \"leaps into desperation after losing out on his sweetheart\" on the chorus, further praising West's \"spirited\" verse and FKA Twigs' \"purring\" ending contribution. At &lt;a href=\"MTV\"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;, Patrick Hosken said the song carries through West's \"momentum\" from \"Wash Us in the Blood\", describing FKA Twigs, Skrillex, and Serpentwithfeet as also \"giving life\" to the former. He continued, stating the \"breezy interlude\" is \"anchored\" by Serpentwithfeet's vocals and the \"gorgeously spacey outro\" is constructed around FKA Twigs. &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Caramanica\"&gt;Jon Caramanica&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" honored the song as an \"eccentric, electric jolt of house music\" that \"deepens\" Ty Dolla Sign's &lt;a href=\"Ty%20Dolla%20Sign%20discography\"&gt;catalog&lt;/a&gt;. Caramanica further observed \"astral, calm singing\" from him on the \"fleet and free\" song, while classifying FKA Twigs' vocals as \"tart\" and noting that West's verse is \"frisky\". In a less glowing review for \"RapReviews\", Steve 'Flash' Juon noted how Ty Dolla Sign \"needs people to feature on his songs more than the other way around\" for getting over being \"a better producer than a singing rapper\"; he predicted \"Ego Death\" would be worthless without West, FKA Twigs, and Skrillex. Ben Devlin was somewhat mixed in \"&lt;a href=\"musicOMH\"&gt;musicOMH&lt;/a&gt;\", viewing the song as the album's \"star-studded lead single\", though he pointed to it resembling a &lt;a href=\"bonus%20track\"&gt;bonus track&lt;/a&gt; hurryingly added on at the end. He went on to call the production \"brilliant\" and similar to \"Fade\", despite being disappointed in West's highly mediocre verse.\nCommercial performance.\nAfter its first full week of tracking, \"Ego Death\" debuted at number seven on the US \"Billboard\" &lt;a href=\"Bubbling%20Under%20Hot%20100\"&gt;Bubbling Under Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; for the chart issue dated July 18, 2020, with 4.5 million on-demand streams. The song lasted for one week on the chart, though earned 2.9 million on-demand streams in its second week of tracking. In the same week as its Hot 100 debut, the song entered the Top Triller U.S. chart at number two, before rising to the summit of the chart for the issue date of July 25, 2020. The song later reached number 29 on the US &lt;a href=\"Rhythmic%20%28chart%29\"&gt;Rhythmic&lt;/a&gt; chart for the issue dated September 5, 2020.\nElsewhere in North America, the song charted at number 69 on the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Hot%20100\"&gt;Canadian Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;. It remained on the chart for a total of two weeks. \"Ego Death\" experienced similar performance in Australia, reaching number 68 on the &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Charts\"&gt;ARIA Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. In the United Kingdom, the song was most successful, entering the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; at number 34. It spent nine weeks on the chart, the first four of which were within the top 40. On June 11, 2021, the song was certified silver by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Phonographic%20Industry\"&gt;British Phonographic Industry&lt;/a&gt; (BPI) for amassing 200,000 units in the UK. The song performed similarly in Ireland, debuting at number 41 on the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;Irish Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. It peaked at number 54 on both the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Singles%20and%20Albums%20Charts\"&gt;Scottish Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; and Swedish &lt;a href=\"Sverigetopplistan\"&gt;Sverigetopplistan&lt;/a&gt; chart, as well as debuting at number 57 on the &lt;a href=\"AGATA%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Lithuanian Top 100&lt;/a&gt;. \"Ego Death\" further opened at number two on the Top Triller Global chart, with the top video for the song accumulating 2.3 million plays on the app.\nCredits and personnel.\nCredits adapted from &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20%28service%29\"&gt;Tidal&lt;/a&gt;."
