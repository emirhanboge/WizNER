    "text": "Wanga is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Baganda\"&gt;Baganda&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pantheon%20%28religion%29\"&gt;pantheon&lt;/a&gt; of gods or \"balubaale\", and is associated with &lt;a href=\"divination\"&gt;divination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. He is said to be one of the first Baganda heroes to ascend into godhood. \u00a0\nRepresentation.\nWanga is considered as one of the oldest members of the \"balubaale\".\nFamily.\nWanga is the son of Wadda and Bukulu. Bukulu was created by Katonda and descended to earth with &lt;a href=\"Kintu\"&gt;Kintu&lt;/a&gt;. Wanga is the third child of Wadda and Bukulu and has two other siblings; Musisi, another member of the balubaale who is associated with the &lt;a href=\"earthquake\"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; phenomenon, and Laba.\nMyths.\nThe temple of Wanga.\nIt was said that the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; once fell from the &lt;a href=\"sky\"&gt;sky&lt;/a&gt;. This caused darkness to befall upon the world, and &lt;a href=\"Kabaka%20of%20Buganda\"&gt;the king of Baganda&lt;/a&gt; requested the help of Wanga, who at the time resided in &lt;a href=\"Ssese%20Islands\"&gt;Ssese Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Wanga decided to lend his aid, and set out to Baganda. Then, he returned the sun to its rightful position. As a reward, the king of Baganda built a &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; in his honor. Another interpretation of the myth detailed that the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; also fell from the sky and Wanga also had to return the moon to its original location."
