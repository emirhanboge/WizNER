    "text": "A palette , in the original sense of the word, is a rigid, flat surface on which a painter arranges and mixes &lt;a href=\"paint\"&gt;paint&lt;/a&gt;s. A palette is usually made of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plastic\"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ceramic\"&gt;ceramic&lt;/a&gt;, or other hard, &lt;a href=\"Chemically%20inert\"&gt;inert&lt;/a&gt;, nonporous material, and can vary greatly in size and shape. The most commonly known type of painter's palette is made of a thin wood board designed to be held in the artist's hand and rest on the artist's arm.\nWatercolor palettes are generally made of plastic or porcelain with rectangular or wheel format with built in wells and mixing areas for colors.\nPalettes are also a universal symbol of painting and art in general, alongside &lt;a href=\"Paintbrush\"&gt;paintbrushes&lt;/a&gt;, for example in the symbol of &lt;a href=\"Microsoft%20Paint\"&gt;Microsoft Paint&lt;/a&gt;."
