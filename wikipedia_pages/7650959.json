    "text": "Azra Erhat (4 June 1915 \u2013 6 September 1982) was a &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20people\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; author, &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeologist&lt;/a&gt;, academician, &lt;a href=\"philology\"&gt;classical philologist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"translator\"&gt;translator&lt;/a&gt;. A pioneer of Turkish &lt;a href=\"Humanism\"&gt;Humanism&lt;/a&gt;, Azra Erhat is especially well known for her published works, including many translations into Turkish from the &lt;a href=\"classical%20literature\"&gt;classical literature&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAzra Erhat was born on 4 June 1915 in \u015ei\u015fli, Istanbul. Her parents were Tevfik Bey and Nakibe Han\u0131m. Nakibe and her sister, Mukbile, were the children of Fatma Han\u0131m and Fad\u0131l Bey. Fadil Bey (1857-1938) was born in Selanik (Thessaloniki),today in Greece, where he completed his primary and secondary education before traveling to Istanbul, where he graduated from law school. Working as a lawyer while splitting his time between Istanbul and Thessaloniki, Fadil and his wife, Fatma, eventually settled down in &lt;a href=\"Buyukada\"&gt;Buyukada&lt;/a&gt; Island, Istanbul Province, in 1923. \nThe period of Azra Erhat\u2019s birth was a time of upheaval, coinciding with the &lt;a href=\"occupation%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;occupation of Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; by British, French, and Italian forces. She moved with her parents to &lt;a href=\"Izmir\"&gt;Izmir&lt;/a&gt; in 1922 and to &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; in 1924, when her father's work was transferred there. Erhat received two years of primary education in &lt;a href=\"Volksschule\"&gt;Volksschule&lt;/a&gt;, Vienna, before her father's work necessitated another move, this time to &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. There she completed primary school and then attended &lt;a href=\"Emile%20Jacqmain%20High%20School\"&gt;Emile Jacqmain High School&lt;/a&gt; () where she gained a strong interest in literature while studying French, Flemish, Latin, and Ancient Greek. When Erhat's father died in 1932, Azra stayed in Brussels at a friend's home to complete high school while her family moved back to Istanbul. Finishing with the highest achievement level -(\"\"), she then rejoined her family in Istanbul. In 1934 Azra entered the &lt;a href=\"Istanbul%20University\"&gt;Istanbul University&lt;/a&gt; Faculty of Arts degree, where her most influential instructor was the Austrian &lt;a href=\"romance%20languages\"&gt;romance philologist&lt;/a&gt; and prolific literary critic, &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Spitzer\"&gt;Leo Spitzer&lt;/a&gt;. Introducing Erhat to Professor George Rodhe of &lt;a href=\"Ankara%20University\"&gt;Ankara University&lt;/a&gt; in 1936, Spitzer recommended Azra for a student-assistant position translating Rodhe's lessons from French, German, Latin, and Greek content into Turkish. On September 1, 1936, Erhat accepted the offer and transferred to the newly inaugurated Department of Classical Philology of the Faculty of Languages, History, and Geography at Ankara University. Working as a student-translator-assistant up to and beyond graduation in 1939, she continued as an assistant in the University's Department of Classical &lt;a href=\"Philology\"&gt;Philology&lt;/a&gt; and became an associate professor in 1946. During this same period, Azra also worked in the Translation Office established by Minister of Education &lt;a href=\"Hasan%20Ali%20Y%C3%BCcel\"&gt;Hasan Ali Y\u00fccel&lt;/a&gt; with fellow Turkish &lt;a href=\"Humanism\"&gt;Humanism&lt;/a&gt; pioneers &lt;a href=\"Sabahattin%20Ey%C3%BCbo%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Sabahattin Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vedat%20G%C3%BCnyol\"&gt;Vedat G\u00fcnyol&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Orhan%20Burian\"&gt;Orhan Burian&lt;/a&gt; (), and Saffet Korkut, establishing close friendships with them. In 1945, separately and together with Orhan Veli, she translated and published many works from &lt;a href=\"Homer\"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aristophanes\"&gt;Aristophanes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sophocles\"&gt;Sophocles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Plato\"&gt;Plato&lt;/a&gt;. \nWith the departure of Hasan Ali Y\u00fccel as Turkey\u2019s minister of education following the 1946 elections, the political atmosphere began changing in the Department of Education. In 1948, during a cleansing of left-leaning thinkers, Erhat and fellow faculty members, including &lt;a href=\"Pertev%20Naili%20Boratav\"&gt;Pertev Naili Boratav&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Behice%20Boran\"&gt;Behice Boran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adnan%20Cemgil\"&gt;Adnan Cemgil&lt;/a&gt; (), and &lt;a href=\"Niyazi%20Berkes\"&gt;Niyazi Berkes&lt;/a&gt;, were dismissed from Ankara University. Returning to Istanbul, Erhat continued working from 1949 to 1955 as a translator, an art critic, and news reporter, when she received a position with the Turkish daily newspaper, \"&lt;a href=\"Vatan\"&gt;Vatan&lt;/a&gt;\", where she worked until 1956. From 1956 until her retirement in 1975, Erhat worked in the library of the United Nations' &lt;a href=\"International%20Labour%20Organization\"&gt;International Labour Organization&lt;/a&gt; (ILO) Near and Middle East Center. In 1971, Erhat, Sabahattin Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu, and Vedat G\u00fcnyol were arrested and charged with violating Article 141 of the Turkish Criminal Code (establishing a secret &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; organization) during the &lt;a href=\"coup%20d%E2%80%99etat\"&gt;coup d\u2019etat&lt;/a&gt; of March 12 &lt;a href=\"1971%20Turkish%20military%20memorandum\"&gt;1971 Turkish military memorandum&lt;/a&gt;. Detained for 4 months in the &lt;a href=\"Maltepe%2C%20Istanbul\"&gt;Maltepe&lt;/a&gt; Military Prison, Erhat and her companions were released in the first legal session. While she was unable to work throughout the one and a half years until her lawsuit was finally closed, the ILO supported Erhat and protected her staff.\nThe years between 1956 and 1982 are considered Erhat's most creative and prolific period, with the publication of many literary works during this time. Individual works and others she collaborated on with Sabahattin Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu were published in \"New Horizons\" Magazine ('). In collaboration with Ibrahim Abdulkadir Mericboyu, alias/pen-name &lt;a href=\"A.%20Kadir\"&gt;A. Kadir&lt;/a&gt; (), Erhat translated &lt;a href=\"Homer\"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Iliad\"&gt;Iliad&lt;/a&gt;\", winning the Habib T\u00f6rehan Science Award in 1959 for Volume 1, and the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Language%20Institution\"&gt;Turkish Language Institution&lt;/a&gt; Translation Award in 1961 for Volume 3. Erhat's translation of Homer's \"&lt;a href=\"Odyssey\"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;\" was published in 1970, her \"Dictionary of Mythology\" (') was published in 1972, and her Ph.D. thesis provided the material published in collaboration with &lt;a href=\"Cengiz%20Bekta%C5%9F\"&gt;Cengiz Bekta\u015f&lt;/a&gt; in 1978 entitled, \"Conversations and Poetry on &lt;a href=\"Sappho\"&gt;Sappho&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"\"). Azra Erhat also occasionally wrote under the &lt;a href=\"pseudonym\"&gt;pseudonym&lt;/a&gt; Ay\u015fe Nur.\nOn September 6, 1982, after unsuccessful treatment in London for cancer, Azra Erhat died in Istanbul at age 67. Her body was buried at the B\u00fclb\u00fcldere Cemetery in &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar\"&gt;\u00dcsk\u00fcdar&lt;/a&gt;, Istanbul. \nFollowing Erhat\u2019s death, her books were endowed to &lt;a href=\"Anadolu%20University\"&gt;Anadolu University&lt;/a&gt;, with a collection created in her memory. In 1983, in honor of Erhat\u2019s significant contribution to &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Literature\"&gt;Classical Literature&lt;/a&gt; translations, \"Yazko\" a Turkish journal of translation, began offering a &lt;a href=\"literary%20award\"&gt;literary award&lt;/a&gt; in her name.\nAzra Erhat\u2019s translations of Homer\u2019s \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" are still primary sources of classical literature in Turkey today. Drawn from Erhat\u2019s distinctive humanism gained \u201cfrom local values and bridges between Western cultures and Anatolian cultures,\u201d her language and writing style \u201cprovides a simple and understandable epic text.\u201d Enabling readers who are unable to read the original texts, Erhat\u2019s translations, \u201cwhich are not only linguistically but structurally and formally successful, also carry the Anatolian identity that the translator cares about and reflect the epicenter of the land they belong to.\u201d\nIn the Introduction to Azra Erhat\u2019s book, \"\u0130\u015fte \u0130nsan (Ecce Homo)\", Azra writes: (Turkish):\n\"B\u00fcy\u00fck tuttum bu i\u015fi: d\u00f6rt y\u0131ll\u0131k d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcncemi, ya\u015fant\u0131m\u0131 bir kitaba s\u0131\u011fd\u0131rmak isterdim.

In Homer, I went on the road, body soul duality was erected, and I looked at it; Plato's human understanding, society, the wisdom of my mind, I understand it, I opened up to an immense field of thought. Freedom, happiness, humanity ... Problems, hairs woven with gold wires attracted the dangers pulled me from there. (...) I had a support: I have confidence in life. I've made a human being: I live like a human, I want to live a full, full of enthusiasm, let me understand the human, I can say human. I saw humanity in love alone and waited for love, let me print my book in line by line. I wasn't mistaken: Ecce Homo wrote me with love.\"\n-Azra Erhat-\nOrigination of Turkey\u2019s \u201cBlue Cruise\u201d Movement.\nStrongly connected with her activities as a writer and translator, Erhat\u2019s recreational activities likewise significantly impacted the rising trend of Westernization in &lt;a href=\"Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk\"&gt;Kemal Atat\u00fcrk&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Turkey\"&gt;Republic of Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. Together with fellow authors &lt;a href=\"Cevat%20%C5%9Eakir%20Kabaa%C4%9Fa%C3%A7l%C4%B1\"&gt;Cevat \u015eakir Kabaa\u011fa\u00e7l\u0131&lt;/a&gt;, alias/pen-name \"The Fisherman of &lt;a href=\"Halicarnassus\"&gt;Halicarnassus&lt;/a&gt;\" ('), and Sabahattin Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu, Azra Erhat is considered an originator of the literary and touristic term, \"&lt;a href=\"Blue%20Cruise\"&gt;Blue Cruise&lt;/a&gt;\" ('). Used in &lt;a href=\"Tourism%20in%20Turkey\"&gt;Turkey's tourism industry&lt;/a&gt;, the name \"Blue Cruise\" (or \"Blue Voyage\") is the title of Erhat\u2019s &lt;a href=\"travel%20literature\"&gt;travelogue&lt;/a&gt;, \"Mavi Yolculuk\", originally published in 1962 and republished in 2005.\nCevat \u015eakir Kabaa\u011fa\u00e7l\u0131, sentenced in 1925 to a 3-year exile to &lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt; found this sleepy fishing village known in antiquity as &lt;a href=\"Halicarnassus\"&gt;Halicarnassus&lt;/a&gt; so charming that, long after his exile ended, he returned to settle down there. Convincing his closest friends and fellow members of the Turkish &lt;a href=\"intelligentsia\"&gt;intelligentsia&lt;/a&gt; of the unspoiled beauties of the shoreline and rural environment of Bodrum, authors &lt;a href=\"Sabahattin%20Ey%C3%BCbo%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Sabahattin Ey\u00fcbo\u011flu&lt;/a&gt;, Azra Erhat, and others soon joined Cevat, who had renamed himself \"Halikarnas Bal\u0131k\u00e7\u0131s\u0131\" (\"the Fisherman of Halicarnassus\"). In the coming decades, the close friends would enjoy many long sailing trips together in the local sponge divers' sailing boats, called &lt;a href=\"gulet\"&gt;gulet&lt;/a&gt;s. Finding herself immersed in a lush natural landscape seemingly unchanged since antiquity, Erhat viewed her surroundings as \u201cthe scenes of historical and mythological events.\u201d Expressing her strong belief that Anatolia gave birth to &lt;a href=\"Western%20civilization\"&gt;Western civilization&lt;/a&gt;, Erhat charmed her companions (and soon her readers) with detailed discussions from &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Literature\"&gt;Classical Literature&lt;/a&gt; on Halicarnassus, &lt;a href=\"Troy\"&gt;Troy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pergamum\"&gt;Pergamum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ephesus\"&gt;Ephesus&lt;/a&gt;, and other famous &lt;a href=\"Anatolia\"&gt;Anatolian&lt;/a&gt; sites of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;.\nEspecially with the 1962 release of Erhat\u2019s immensely popular travel book, \"Mavi Yolculuk\" (\"Blue Cruise\"), and articles written by Erhat and her colleagues at \"New Horizons\" Magazine (\"\"), the Turkish reading public began flocking to this region. Guidebooks were published in both Turkish and German and soon the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Riviera\"&gt;Turquoise Coast&lt;/a&gt; became an international tourist destination that is still famous today for Blue Cruises.\nEnduring until the end of their lives, the relationship between Azra Erhat and the Fisherman of Halicarnassus (') blossomed into a love story regularly nourished by Blue Cruises when they were together and thousands of letters written to each other when they were apart. After Halikarnas Bal\u0131k\u00e7\u0131s\u0131 died in 1972, with his prior permission, Erhat published a collection of his letters in her 1976 book, \"Letters of the Fisherman of Halicarnassus\" (').\nBibliography.\nAzra Erhat has written 104 works in 307 publications in 2 languages and 633 library holdings, according to &lt;a href=\"WorldCat\"&gt;WorldCat&lt;/a&gt; Identities. Among her more popular books, WorldCat notes, \"Mektuplar\u0131yle Halikarnas Bal\u0131k\u00e7\u0131s\u0131\" (\"Letters of the Halicarnassus Fisherman\"), has had \u201c15 editions published between 1976 and 2002 in Turkish and held by 43 WorldCat member libraries worldwide,\u201d and \"Mitoloji s\u00f6zl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc\" (\"Dictionary of Mythology\"), with \u201c20 editions published between 1972 and 2011 in Turkish and \u2018undetermined\u2019 and held by 40 WorldCat member libraries worldwide.\u201d "
