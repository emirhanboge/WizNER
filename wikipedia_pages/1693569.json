    "text": "Raoul Martial \"Rod\" Dedeaux (February 17, 1914 \u2013 January 5, 2006) was an American &lt;a href=\"college%20baseball\"&gt;college baseball&lt;/a&gt; coach who compiled what is widely recognized as among the greatest records of any coach in the sport's &lt;a href=\"Amateur%20baseball%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;amateur history&lt;/a&gt;.\nDedeaux was the head baseball coach at the &lt;a href=\"USC%20Trojans%20baseball\"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; (USC) in Los Angeles for 45 seasons, and retired at age 72 in 1986. His teams won 11 national titles (&lt;a href=\"College%20World%20Series\"&gt;College World Series&lt;/a&gt;), including a record five straight (&lt;a href=\"1970%20NCAA%20University%20Division%20Baseball%20Tournament%23College%20World%20Series\"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"1974%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Baseball%20Tournament%23College%20World%20Series\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;), and 28 &lt;a href=\"Pac-12%20Conference\"&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; championships. Dedeaux was named Coach of the Year six times by the Collegiate Baseball Coaches Association and was inducted into its Hall of Fame in 1970. He was named \"Coach of the Century\" by \"&lt;a href=\"Collegiate%20Baseball%20Newspaper\"&gt;Collegiate Baseball&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine, and was one of the ten initial inductees to the &lt;a href=\"National%20College%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;College Baseball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;New Orleans, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, Dedeaux moved to Los Angeles and graduated from &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20High%20School\"&gt;Hollywood High School&lt;/a&gt; in 1931. He played baseball at the University of Southern California for three seasons. Dedeaux then played professional baseball briefly in 1935, appearing in two games as a &lt;a href=\"shortstop\"&gt;shortstop&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1935%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers%20season\"&gt;Brooklyn Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; late in the season. The following year while playing for &lt;a href=\"Dayton%20Ducks\"&gt;Dayton&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mid-Atlantic%20League\"&gt;Mid-Atlantic League&lt;/a&gt;, he cracked a &lt;a href=\"vertebra\"&gt;vertebra&lt;/a&gt; while swinging in cold weather, and his playing career ended. He then turned to coaching in the semi-pro and amateur ranks.\nCareer.\nDedeaux invested $500 to start a trucking firm, Dart (Dedeaux Automotive Repair and Transit) Enterprises, which he built into a successful regional business. When his college coach, &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Barry\"&gt;Sam Barry&lt;/a&gt;, entered the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;U.S. Navy&lt;/a&gt; during World War II, he recommended Dedeaux to take over the team in for the war's duration. Upon Barry's return in 1946, they served as co-coaches, with Dedeaux running the team each year until Barry finished the &lt;a href=\"USC%20Trojans%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; season. USC won its first national title in &lt;a href=\"1948%20NCAA%20baseball%20season\"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;, over &lt;a href=\"1948%20Yale%20Bulldogs%20baseball%20team\"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;, captained by first baseman &lt;a href=\"George%20H.%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"1948%20College%20World%20Series\"&gt;finals&lt;/a&gt; were held at &lt;a href=\"Hyames%20Field\"&gt;Hyames Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Kalamazoo, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, settled by a 9\u20132 win in the third and deciding game.\nFollowing Barry's death in September 1950, Dedeaux became the sole coach and proceeded to build on the early success to establish the strongest program in collegiate baseball. Prior to his retirement in June , Dedeaux's teams won ten additional &lt;a href=\"College%20World%20Series\"&gt;College World Series&lt;/a&gt; titles in &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Rosenblatt%20Stadium\"&gt;Omaha&lt;/a&gt;, including five consecutively (1970\u201374), the sixth in seven years. No other coach won more than three titles until 1997.\nAt USC, Dedeaux coached dozens of future &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;major leaguers&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Fairly\"&gt;Ron Fairly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Don%20Buford\"&gt;Don Buford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Seaver\"&gt;Tom Seaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kingman\"&gt;Dave Kingman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Smalley%20III\"&gt;Roy Smalley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Lynn\"&gt;Fred Lynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Kemp\"&gt;Steve Kemp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20McGwire\"&gt;Mark McGwire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Randy%20Johnson\"&gt;Randy Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout his USC career, he accepted a nominal salary of just $1 per year, as his trucking business supplied him with a substantial income. He turned down numerous offers of &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;major league&lt;/a&gt; coaching positions, including invitations from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers\"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; manager &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Lasorda\"&gt;Tommy Lasorda&lt;/a&gt; to join his staff, always rejecting them due to his preference for the college game and his desire to remain close to his family.\nHe retired as the winningest coach in college baseball history with a record of 1,332\u2013571\u201311 (), and for the rest of his life remained an honored annual presence at the College World Series in Omaha. At the 1999 edition, the 50th played in Omaha, he was given a key to the city by the mayor and a one-minute standing ovation by the fans at &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Rosenblatt%20Stadium\"&gt;Rosenblatt Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. He was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"American%20Baseball%20Coaches%20Association\"&gt;American Baseball Coaches Association&lt;/a&gt;'s Hall of Fame in 1970, and in 1999 was named the Coach of the Century by \"Collegiate Baseball\" magazine.\nUSC played its home games at &lt;a href=\"Bovard%20Field\"&gt;Bovard Field&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"1973%20USC%20Trojans%20baseball%20team\"&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt;, and Dedeaux became known as \"The Houdini of Bovard\" for the come-from-behind home-field wins by the Trojans. A new baseball field named &lt;a href=\"Dedeaux%20Field\"&gt;Dedeaux Field&lt;/a&gt; opened in &lt;a href=\"1974%20USC%20Trojans%20baseball%20team\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;, named in honor of the active head coach.\nOlympics.\nDedeaux was the head coach of the United States baseball teams at the &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20at%20the%201964%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1964 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Tokyo and the &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20at%20the%201984%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1984 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles, where baseball was contested both times as a &lt;a href=\"demonstration%20sport\"&gt;demonstration sport&lt;/a&gt;. The 1964 team played one game as part of the Olympic program, defeating a Japanese amateur all-star team, while the 1984 team finished second in a field of eight teams, winning its first four games and losing to Japan in the final game of the tournament.\nFilms.\nDedeaux also served as the baseball coach and consultant for actors and ballplayers on the &lt;a href=\"1989%20in%20film\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt; film \"&lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Dreams\"&gt;Field of Dreams&lt;/a&gt;\". While Dedeaux was critical of the \"phoniness that was in baseball movies,\" an opinion which he acquired while working as an extra in the &lt;a href=\"1948%20in%20film\"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt; film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Babe%20Ruth%20Story\"&gt;The Babe Ruth Story&lt;/a&gt;\", he accepted the task after reading the original novel \"&lt;a href=\"Shoeless%20Joe\"&gt;Shoeless Joe&lt;/a&gt;\", and brought Buford along to help him coach the cast. &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Alden%20Robinson\"&gt;Phil Alden Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, who directed the film, said the following about Dedeaux:\nAll of the ballplayers in the movie were prepped for the film by Rod Dedeaux. He coached at USC for many years, and is a wonderful man, very full of life, energetic, very supportive, just really was very giving of himself and cheerful all the time, was a great spirit to have around. And one day, we were in between setups and I said, 'Hey, coach, what position did you play?' He said, 'I was a shortstop.' I said, 'Really, could you \u2014 were you good?' He got very quiet, and he said, 'I could field the ball.' I said, 'Could you hit?' He said, 'I could hit the ball.' And he was strangely quiet. And I said to him, 'Well, how come you never played in the majors?' And he said, 'I did.' I said, 'Really?' [Dedeaux said] 'Yes, in 1930-something.' I forget what year he said. He was the starting shortstop for the Brooklyn Dodgers. He played one game, broke his back, and that was the end of his career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I just blanched. I said, 'My God, you're &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Graham\"&gt;Doc Graham&lt;/a&gt;.' He said, 'That's right.' And I said, 'Do you ever think about, \"gee, the career I might've had.\"' And he said, 'Every day.' He said it very quietly. It was very out of character for him, and I was so touched by that. And I did look him up in the Baseball Encyclopedia: He did go, I think, 1-for-4 with an RBI. That was his lifetime stats. So having him be the man who trained all these fellows, including the kid who plays Doc Graham, was very meaningful to me, and I know it was to him, too. It was great to have him around. I think about that often, about what that must have been like, to be good enough to start with a Major League team, and for one unlucky moment, not be able to do \u2014 the rest of your life takes another turn. What he did with that is, he put all of that emotion \u2014 which could have gone into bitterness or regret \u2014 into being a phenomenal coach. He sent more people to the majors than, I think, anybody else in college history. He's an amazing man.\nPersonal.\nDedeaux was married to the former Helen L. Jones (1915\u20132007) for 66 years, and they had four children.\nDeath and legacy.\nDedeaux died in early at age 91 at &lt;a href=\"Glendale%20Adventist%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Glendale Adventist Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glendale%2C%20California\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;, of complications from a &lt;a href=\"stroke\"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; five weeks earlier. Six months later on July 4, he was one of ten in the first class inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame. Dedeaux was also inducted in the inaugural class of the Omaha College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013, and a statue of him was unveiled at Dedeaux Field on the USC campus in 2014.\nDedeaux was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Reliquary\"&gt;Baseball Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Reliquary%23Shrine%20of%20the%20Eternals\"&gt;Shrine of the Eternals&lt;/a&gt; in 2005.\nDedeaux and his wife Helen are buried in Los Angeles at &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Lawn%20Memorial%20Park%20%28Hollywood%20Hills%29\"&gt;Forest Lawn Memorial Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Hills\"&gt;Hollywood Hills&lt;/a&gt;."
