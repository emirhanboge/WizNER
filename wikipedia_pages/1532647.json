    "text": "The Los Angeles Opera is an American &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; company in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, California. It is the fourth-largest opera company in the United States. The company's home base is the &lt;a href=\"Dorothy%20Chandler%20Pavilion\"&gt;Dorothy Chandler Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Music%20Center\"&gt;Los Angeles Music Center&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeadership.\nSpanish tenor and conductor &lt;a href=\"Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo\"&gt;Pl\u00e1cido Domingo&lt;/a&gt; was general director of Los Angeles Opera from 2003 to 2019. Domingo sang 27 different roles with the company. He has also conducted 16 different operas and numerous concerts with the company. Domingo resigned in October 2019 following numerous accusations of sexual misconduct. Los Angeles Opera subsequently hired the law firm of &lt;a href=\"Gibson%20Dunn\"&gt;Gibson Dunn&lt;/a&gt;, under the leadership of former United States Attorney and Superior Court Judge &lt;a href=\"Debra%20Wong%20Yang\"&gt;Debra Wong Yang&lt;/a&gt;, to conduct an independent investigation of the accusations. After interviewing 44 individuals, Gibson Dunn found that Domingo neither engaged in sexual &lt;a href=\"quid%20pro%20quo\"&gt;quid pro quo&lt;/a&gt; nor any professional retaliation against women who rebuffed his advances. They also concluded that Los Angeles Opera policies and procedures against sexual harassment were \u201csufficient on their face,\u201d but suggested a number of improvements. Los Angeles Opera accepted the findings and committed to implementing Gibson Dunn\u2019s recommendations.\nAmerican conductor &lt;a href=\"James%20Conlon\"&gt;James Conlon&lt;/a&gt; has been music director since 2006, succeeding &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Nagano\"&gt;Kent Nagano&lt;/a&gt;, who held the official title of \"principal conductor\" from 2001 until 2003 and then became music director.\nChristopher Koelsch has been the president and chief executive officer of Los Angeles Opera since 2012. He previously held the position of senior vice president and chief operating officer since 2010, after serving as vice president for artistic planning. He is the first year-round resident of Los Angeles to lead Los Angeles Opera since 2007.\n&lt;a href=\"Grant%20Gershon\"&gt;Grant Gershon&lt;/a&gt; became resident conductor as of the 2012\u201313 season, after previously serving as associate conductor/chorus master since 2007. Previous conductors-in-residence included William Vendice, head of music staff/chorus master, from 1995 to 2007; and Randall Behr, resident conductor, chorus master, and head of music staff from 1988 to 1995.\nHistory.\nLos Angeles Opera, which was inaugurated in 1986 with a production of &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Verdi\"&gt;Verdi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Otello\"&gt;Otello&lt;/a&gt;\" starring &lt;a href=\"Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo\"&gt;Pl\u00e1cido Domingo&lt;/a&gt;, traces its roots back to the Los Angeles Civic Grand Opera which was formed in 1948. It presented staged productions in a church located in &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Hills%2C%20California\"&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt; through the 1950s, funded by furniture maker &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Pace\"&gt;Francesco Pace&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Carol%20F.%20Henry\"&gt;Carol F. Henry&lt;/a&gt;, who later served as the Los Angeles Opera president of the board, started volunteering for the Los Angeles Opera League in 1981. Shortly after its third production at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the company abandoned its own production projects and recreated itself as the Music Center Opera Association by bringing opera from other cities to the Music Center, notably &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Opera\"&gt;San Francisco Opera&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Opera\"&gt;New York City Opera&lt;/a&gt;. San Francisco Opera began presenting productions in Los Angeles in 1937 and continued to do so every fall until 1969. The NYCO brought productions to Los Angeles every fall from 1966 to 1982.\nIn 1984, the Music Center Opera Association hired &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Hemmings\"&gt;Peter Hemmings&lt;/a&gt; and gave him the task of creating a local opera company which would once again present its own productions. This led to the forming of Los Angeles Opera. Hemmings stepped down as General Director in 2000, with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who had been artistic advisor since 1984, assuming leadership of the company the following season. In November 2001, &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Baitzel\"&gt;Edgar Baitzel&lt;/a&gt; was appointed director of artistic operations. Baitzel was appointed the company's Artistic Director in May 2003 and then its chief operating officer in February 2006. Baitzel died in March 2007. In September 2012, Christopher Koelsch was appointed president and chief executive officer. He previously held the position of senior vice president and chief operating officer since 2010, after serving as vice president for artistic planning.\nProductions of non-standard repertory.\nThe company offers productions in the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20important%20operas\"&gt;standard operatic repertory&lt;/a&gt; as well as new and rarely staged operas. In 2015, Los Angeles Opera presented a new production of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ghosts%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;The Ghosts of Versailles&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"John%20Corigliano\"&gt;John Corigliano&lt;/a&gt;, the first major U.S. staging of that opera in 20 years. In 2014, &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9e%20Fleming\"&gt;Ren\u00e9e Fleming&lt;/a&gt; starred in a production of &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Previn\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Previn&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Streetcar%20Named%20Desire%20%28opera%29\"&gt;A Streetcar Named Desire&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2003, it presented the world premiere of the opera \"Nicholas and Alexandra\", with music composed by &lt;a href=\"Deborah%20Drattell\"&gt;Deborah Drattell&lt;/a&gt; and text by &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20von%20Hoffman\"&gt;Nicholas von Hoffman&lt;/a&gt;. The 2010\u20132011 season opened with the world premi\u00e8re of &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Cat%C3%A1n\"&gt;Daniel Cat\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;'s opera \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20Postino%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Il Postino&lt;/a&gt;\", based on the 1994 drama film \"\", with Domingo as the poet &lt;a href=\"Pablo%20Neruda\"&gt;Pablo Neruda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Castronovo\"&gt;Charles Castronovo&lt;/a&gt; in the title role and &lt;a href=\"Grant%20Gershon\"&gt;Grant Gershon&lt;/a&gt; conducting. In 2020 it presented the world premiere of &lt;a href=\"Eurydice%20%28Aucoin%29\"&gt;\"Eurydice\"&lt;/a&gt;, composed by &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Aucoin\"&gt;Matthew Aucoin&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Ruhl\"&gt;Sarah Ruhl&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe company has also frequently turned to the cinema world for directors of its productions. During the 2001\u20132002 season, it mounted a production of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Wagner&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Lohengrin%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Lohengrin&lt;/a&gt;\", directed by Austrian actor &lt;a href=\"Maximilian%20Schell\"&gt;Maximilian Schell&lt;/a&gt; and a double bill of &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k\"&gt;Bart\u00f3k&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Bluebeard%27s%20Castle\"&gt;Bluebeard's Castle&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Giacomo%20Puccini\"&gt;Puccini&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Gianni%20Schicchi\"&gt;Gianni Schicchi&lt;/a&gt;\", directed by filmmaker &lt;a href=\"William%20Friedkin\"&gt;William Friedkin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Garry%20Marshall\"&gt;Garry Marshall&lt;/a&gt; directed his own adaptation of &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Offenbach\"&gt;Jacques Offenbach&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Grande-Duchesse%20de%20G%C3%A9rolstein\"&gt;La Grande-Duchesse de G\u00e9rolstein&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2005. Friedkin returned to direct &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Strauss\"&gt;Richard Strauss&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Ariadne%20auf%20Naxos\"&gt;Ariadne auf Naxos&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2004 and, in 2008, the first two parts of &lt;a href=\"Giacomo%20Puccini\"&gt;Puccini&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20trittico\"&gt;Il trittico&lt;/a&gt;,\" \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20tabarro\"&gt;Il tabarro&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Suor%20Angelica\"&gt;Suor Angelica&lt;/a&gt;,\" a production that also featured &lt;a href=\"Woody%20Allen\"&gt;Woody Allen&lt;/a&gt; making his operatic debut staging \"&lt;a href=\"Gianni%20Schicchi\"&gt;Gianni Schicchi&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nHighlights of the last decade have included &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Weill\"&gt;Kurt Weill&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Rise%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Mahagonny\"&gt;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&lt;/a&gt;\" starring &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Dean%20Griffey\"&gt;Anthony Dean Griffey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Audra%20McDonald\"&gt;Audra McDonald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Patti%20LuPone\"&gt;Patti LuPone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rossini\"&gt;Rossini&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20turco%20in%20Italia\"&gt;Il turco in Italia&lt;/a&gt;\" starring &lt;a href=\"Nino%20Machaidze\"&gt;Nino Machaidze&lt;/a&gt; Simone Alberghini, &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Gavanelli\"&gt;Paolo Gavanelli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Allen%20%28baritone%29\"&gt;Thomas Allen&lt;/a&gt;, and three major works by &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Britten\"&gt;Benjamin Britten&lt;/a&gt;: \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Turn%20of%20the%20Screw%20%28opera%29\"&gt;The Turn of the Screw&lt;/a&gt;\" starring &lt;a href=\"Patricia%20Racette\"&gt;Patricia Racette&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Albert%20Herring\"&gt;Albert Herring&lt;/a&gt;\" starring Alek Shrader in the title role, with &lt;a href=\"Janis%20Kelly%20%28soprano%29\"&gt;Janis Kelly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christine%20Brewer\"&gt;Christine Brewer&lt;/a&gt; sharing the role of Lady Billows, and \"&lt;a href=\"Billy%20Budd%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Billy Budd&lt;/a&gt;\" starring &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Bonner\"&gt;Liam Bonner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Croft%20%28tenor%29\"&gt;Richard Croft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greer%20Grimsley\"&gt;Greer Grimsley&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable guest performers.\nOther frequent and notable guests with the company have included &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Ramey\"&gt;Samuel Ramey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Violeta%20Urmana\"&gt;Violeta Urmana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hildegard%20Behrens\"&gt;Hildegard Behrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denyce%20Graves\"&gt;Denyce Graves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frederica%20von%20Stade\"&gt;Frederica von Stade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sumi%20Jo\"&gt;Sumi Jo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deborah%20Voigt\"&gt;Deborah Voigt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20Morris%20%28bass-baritone%29\"&gt;James Morris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rod%20Gilfry\"&gt;Rod Gilfry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jennifer%20Larmore\"&gt;Jennifer Larmore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Ewing\"&gt;Maria Ewing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Susan%20Graham\"&gt;Susan Graham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ferruccio%20Furlanetto\"&gt;Ferruccio Furlanetto&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompany programs and features.\nRecovered Voices project.\nThe company's multi-year project Recovered Voices, begun during the 2006-2007 season, is dedicated to presenting little known operas by the lost generation of composers whose lives and careers were cut short by the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Third Reich&lt;/a&gt;. To date, the company has presented &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20von%20Zemlinsky\"&gt;Alexander von Zemlinsky&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Eine%20florentinische%20Trag%C3%B6die\"&gt;Eine florentinische Trag\u00f6die&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"An Italian Tragedy\") and \"&lt;a href=\"Der%20Zwerg\"&gt;Der Zwerg&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Dwarf\"), the U.S. premiere of &lt;a href=\"Viktor%20Ullmann\"&gt;Viktor Ullmann&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Der zerbrochene Krug\" (\"The Broken Jug\"), &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Braunfels\"&gt;Walter Braunfels&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20V%C3%B6gel%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Die V\u00f6gel&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Birds\") and the U.S. premiere of &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Schreker\"&gt;Franz Schreker&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Gezeichneten\"&gt;Die Gezeichneten&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Stigmatized\") as part of this mission, as well as children's performances of &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Kr%C3%A1sa\"&gt;Hans Kr\u00e1sa&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Brundib%C3%A1r\"&gt;Brundib\u00e1r&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Der Ring des Nibelungen\".\nThe company presented its first presentation of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Richard Wagner&lt;/a&gt;'s complete \"&lt;a href=\"Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen\"&gt;Der Ring des Nibelungen&lt;/a&gt;\" in the summer of 2010. New productions of \"&lt;a href=\"Das%20Rheingold\"&gt;Das Rheingold&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Walk%C3%BCre\"&gt;Die Walk\u00fcre&lt;/a&gt;\" were performed in early 2009, followed by \"&lt;a href=\"Siegfried%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Siegfried&lt;/a&gt;\" (September\u2013October 2009) and \"&lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung\"&gt;G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung&lt;/a&gt;\" (April 2010). Three full cycles were produced from May 29 through June 26, 2010, accompanied by the citywide \"Ring Festival LA\". The innovative production was directed and designed by German theater artist &lt;a href=\"Achim%20Freyer\"&gt;Achim Freyer&lt;/a&gt; and conducted by &lt;a href=\"James%20Conlon\"&gt;James Conlon&lt;/a&gt;. The principal artists included &lt;a href=\"Linda%20Watson%20%28soprano%29\"&gt;Linda Watson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vitalij%20Kowaljow\"&gt;Vitalij Kowaljow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20DeYoung\"&gt;Michelle DeYoung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo\"&gt;Pl\u00e1cido Domingo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Treleaven\"&gt;John Treleaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Graham%20Clark%20%28tenor%29\"&gt;Graham Clark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Paul%20Fink\"&gt;Richard Paul Fink&lt;/a&gt;, Eric Halfvarson, &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Held\"&gt;Alan Held&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jennifer%20Wilson\"&gt;Jennifer Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, among others.\nThe festival drew criticism from Los Angeles County Supervisor &lt;a href=\"Michael%20D.%20Antonovich\"&gt;Michael D. Antonovich&lt;/a&gt;, who argued that Wagner's work was the \"soundtrack to the &lt;a href=\"Holocaust\"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;\", a reference to Wagner's anti-Semitic views. Wagner's music was played by guards at concentration camps and through loudspeakers.\n Antonovich requested that the company broaden the scope of the festival to include other classical and operatic performers, while the company argued that proper attention was made to educate festival-goers on Wagner's racist views, and that broadening the scope would be inappropriate. On a 3\u20131 vote, the other supervisors rejected Antonovich's motion to have the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County%20Board%20of%20Supervisors\"&gt;Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors&lt;/a&gt; send a letter to the company to shift the focus away from Wagner.\nSubsequently, partly as a result of the cost of producing the \"Ring\", the company requested an emergency $14 million loan from the board of supervisors due to reduced sponsorships and escalating costs. The board approved the loan 4\u20131, with Antonovich dissenting. In January 2012, LA Opera repaid half of the loan, with the balance repaid in December 2012.\nEducation and Community Engagement.\nFor over 20 years, the company has produced a wide variety of education and outreach programs designed to bring opera to people of all backgrounds, from young children experiencing opera for the first time to experienced opera lovers of all ages. These include \"In-School Operas\" performed for and by elementary school students; full-scale student matin\u00e9es and a summer \"Opera Camp\" for secondary school students; accredited teacher training programs; large-scale, free community performances for families; a popular lecture series for ticket holders before every mainstage performance; and open dress rehearsals for senior centers. In 2008, these programs were enjoyed by an all-time high of more than 159,000 students, teachers and community members."
