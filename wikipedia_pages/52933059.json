    "text": "Halgurd Sakran National Park (HSNP) will be the first National Park in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. HSNP is situated in &lt;a href=\"Erbil%20Province\"&gt;Erbil Province&lt;/a&gt;, north-east of the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Erbil\"&gt;Erbil&lt;/a&gt; and located on border triangle of Iraq, Iran and Turkey.\nHSNP will be the largest protected mountain area in Kurdistan; it is expected to cover more than with a elevation between and (at &lt;a href=\"Halgurd%20Peak\"&gt;Halgurd Peak&lt;/a&gt;), of the &lt;a href=\"Sakran%20Mountain%20Range\"&gt;Sakran Mountain Range&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the &lt;a href=\"Zagros%20Mountains\"&gt;Zagros Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, which is famous for the spectacular and impressive rock formation, beautiful valleys and mountain meadows with multitude of wild flora and fauna.\nHalgurd and Sakran Mountains are part of one of the most unspoiled areas in Kurdistan; the high elevations ensure that snow covers some parts of the summits of the highest peaks all years around. Preliminary approach for delineation and zoning of the envisaged Halgurd Sakran National Park in mountain areas around the city of &lt;a href=\"Choman%20%28city%29\"&gt;Choman&lt;/a&gt;, identified using modern technology.\nNotes.\nReferences"
