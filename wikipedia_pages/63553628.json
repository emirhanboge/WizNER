    "text": "Cressbrook Dale (also called Ravensdale) is a dry &lt;a href=\"Carboniferous%20Limestone\"&gt;carboniferous limestone&lt;/a&gt; gorge near &lt;a href=\"Bakewell\"&gt;Bakewell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Derbyshire\"&gt;Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Peak%20District\"&gt;Peak District&lt;/a&gt; of England. The dale is cut into a plateau of farmland and lies to the south east of the village of &lt;a href=\"Litton%2C%20Derbyshire\"&gt;Litton&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cressbrook\"&gt;Cressbrook&lt;/a&gt; village is at the foot of the valley to the south.\nThe valley is dry over the summer but has a &lt;a href=\"Winterbourne%20%28stream%29\"&gt;winterbourne stream&lt;/a&gt; which runs into the mill pond at Cressbrook Mill and then into the &lt;a href=\"River%20Wye%2C%20Derbyshire\"&gt;River Wye&lt;/a&gt; in Water-cum-Jolly Dale.\nNature reserve.\nCressbrook Dale is part of the &lt;a href=\"Derbyshire%20Dales%20National%20Nature%20Reserve\"&gt;Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Natural%20England\"&gt;Natural England&lt;/a&gt; manages the reserve which covers five separate dales of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Peak\"&gt;White Peak&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Lathkill%20Dale\"&gt;Lathkill Dale&lt;/a&gt;, Cressbrook Dale, &lt;a href=\"Hay%20Dale\"&gt;Hay Dale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Long%20Dale\"&gt;Long Dale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Monk%27s%20Dale\"&gt;Monk\u2019s Dale&lt;/a&gt;). It is also an &lt;a href=\"Important%20Plant%20Areas\"&gt;Important Plant Area&lt;/a&gt;. The reserve contains &lt;a href=\"Fraxinus\"&gt;ash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulmus%20glabra\"&gt;wych elm&lt;/a&gt; woodland and shrubs including &lt;a href=\"Mercurialis%20perennis\"&gt;dog\u2019s mercury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acer%20campestre\"&gt;field maple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Viburnum%20opulus\"&gt;guelder rose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corylus%20avellana\"&gt;hazel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prunus%20padus\"&gt;bird cherry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cornus%20sanguinea\"&gt;dogwood&lt;/a&gt;. Wildflowers in the reserve include &lt;a href=\"lily-of-the-valley\"&gt;lily-of-the-valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Allium%20ursinum\"&gt;ramsons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geranium%20sanguineum\"&gt;bloody cranesbill&lt;/a&gt;. There are broad areas of scrub with &lt;a href=\"Crataegus\"&gt;hawthorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prunus%20spinosa\"&gt;blackthorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhamnus%20%28plant%29\"&gt;buckthorn&lt;/a&gt; and rose. &lt;a href=\"Helictotrichon%20pratense\"&gt;Meadow oat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carex%20panicea\"&gt;carnation sedge&lt;/a&gt; spread across the ungrazed grasslands, with patches of rare bird\u2019s-foot sedge (\"Carex ornithopoda\"). Cressbrook Dale is also a designated &lt;a href=\"Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest\"&gt;Site of Special Scientific Interest&lt;/a&gt; (SSSI). It is especially important for the lichens growing on the limestone.\nGeology.\nThe sequence of limestones in Cressbrook Dale make it an important geological site. The layers were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the &lt;a href=\"Vis%C3%A9an\"&gt;Brigantian&lt;/a&gt; stage of the &lt;a href=\"Carboniferous\"&gt;Carboniferous&lt;/a&gt; period (around 330 million years ago). The Carboniferous Limestone contains important fossils. Several layers of volcanic rock show that volcanoes were once active in Derbyshire.\nPeter's Stone (named after its resemblance to the dome shape of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica\"&gt;St Peter's Basilica&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;) is the prominent limestone knoll at the northern end of the valley (the Wardlow Mires). It used to be called Gibbet Rock where the last &lt;a href=\"gallows\"&gt;gallows&lt;/a&gt; in the county once stood. The &lt;a href=\"Gibbeting\"&gt;gibbet&lt;/a&gt; was an iron cage holding the dead bodies of executed criminals as a deterrent to others. One of the last cases of gibbeting was of Anthony Lingard from &lt;a href=\"Tideswell\"&gt;Tideswell&lt;/a&gt; in 1815. He was convicted and executed in Derby for killing Hannah Oliver, the toll-keeper at Wardlow Mires, for a pair of red boots. His corpse was hung in chains on Peter\u2019s Stone.\nHigh on the cliff above Ravensdale Cottages is Ravencliffe Cave, which is deep. In the early 20th century, &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Age\"&gt;Stone Age&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Age\"&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; artefacts were recovered from the cave including polished stone axes, an arrowhead, pottery fragments, beads and bronze brooches as well as human and animal remains.\nRavensdale Cliff has numerous low- to middle-grade rock climbing routes up to long on the main buttress. The cliffs of Water-cum-Jolly (at the foot of Cressbrook Dale) are an accessible and extensive area for climbers with over 400 routes.\nIndustry.\nThe large lead mining area at Tansley Dale, towards the head of the valley, is a protected Scheduled Monument. The visible remains are ruined stone walls and earthworks. Ravensdale Cottages (known locally as 'The Wick') in the middle of the valley are two terraces of lead miners' cottages from 1823. They are Grade II listed buildings.\nCressbrook Mill dominates the view at the foot of the valley by the River Wye. The cotton mill was built in 1814\u201315 by William Newton on behalf on J L Philips. It replaced the original mill built in 1779 by Sir &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Arkwright\"&gt;Richard Arkwright&lt;/a&gt;, which burnt down in 1785. The clock on the &lt;a href=\"pediment\"&gt;pediment&lt;/a&gt; and the octagonal &lt;a href=\"cupola\"&gt;cupola&lt;/a&gt; were added in 1837 to commemorate the &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt;'s coronation. The mill closed in 1965. It is a Grade II* listed building.\nAccess.\nThere is an easy-going footpath along the length of the valley floor. The &lt;a href=\"Monsal%20Trail\"&gt;Monsal Trail&lt;/a&gt; bridleway runs along the Wye valley at the southern end of Cressbrook Dale. There is access into the dale from both ends, as well as two footpaths from &lt;a href=\"Litton%2C%20Derbyshire\"&gt;Litton&lt;/a&gt; village into the west side of the valley. There is some roadside parking in Upperdale near the southern foot of the dale."
