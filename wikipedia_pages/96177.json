    "text": "Randolph County is a &lt;a href=\"County%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt;, it had a population of 33,476. Its &lt;a href=\"county%20seat\"&gt;county seat&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Chester%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Chester&lt;/a&gt;.\nOwing to its role in the state's history, the county motto is \"Where Illinois Began.\" It contains the historically important village of &lt;a href=\"Kaskaskia%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Kaskaskia&lt;/a&gt;, Illinois's first capital.\nThe county is part of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Illinois\"&gt;Southern Illinois&lt;/a&gt; in the southern portion of the state known locally as \"&lt;a href=\"Little%20Egypt%20%28region%29\"&gt;Little Egypt&lt;/a&gt;\", and includes fertile river flats, part of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Bottom\"&gt;American Bottom&lt;/a&gt;; it is near the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20St.%20Louis\"&gt;Greater St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; area.\nHistory.\nRandolph County was organized in 1795 out of a part of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Clair%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;St. Clair County&lt;/a&gt;. It was named in honor of &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Randolph\"&gt;Edmund Randolph&lt;/a&gt;, Governor of Virginia. &lt;a href=\"George%20Rogers%20Clark\"&gt;George Rogers Clark&lt;/a&gt; of the army of &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; captured the area from the British on July 4, 1778, near the end of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt;. The area then became the seat, for several years, of &lt;a href=\"Illinois%20County%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Illinois County, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, although the Congress of the Confederation legislated the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Territory\"&gt;Northwest Territory&lt;/a&gt; on July 13, 1787. Edmund Randolph was Governor of Virginia at the time Virginia ceded the Northwest Territory to the United States. In 1809, when &lt;a href=\"Illinois%20Territory\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; became a separate territory, Territorial Secretary &lt;a href=\"Nathaniel%20Pope\"&gt;Nathaniel Pope&lt;/a&gt;, in his capacity as acting governor, issued a proclamation establishing Randolph as one of the Illinois' two original counties. The county's boundaries were last changed in 1827, when land was taken to form &lt;a href=\"Perry%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Perry County&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt; has played a prominent role in the county's history, altering its boundaries in 1881 when it severed the &lt;a href=\"isthmus\"&gt;isthmus&lt;/a&gt; that connected Kaskaskia to the Illinois mainland, destroying the original village of &lt;a href=\"Kaskaskia%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Kaskaskia&lt;/a&gt; and forcing its historic cemetery to be relocated across the river to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Kaskaskia%20State%20Historic%20Site\"&gt;Fort Kaskaskia&lt;/a&gt;. Crains Island &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.google.com/maps%3Ff%3Dq%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bq%3DChester%2C%2BIllinois%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bom%3D1%26amp%3Bz%3D13%26amp%3Bll%3D37.860489%2C-89.7789%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.061936%2C0.173035%26amp%3Biwloc%3Daddr\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, southeast of &lt;a href=\"Chester%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Chester&lt;/a&gt;, is another &lt;a href=\"enclave\"&gt;enclave&lt;/a&gt; of Illinois west of the Mississippi that was created by a change in the river's course.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.6%) is water.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kaskaskia%20River\"&gt;Kaskaskia River&lt;/a&gt; flows into the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt; in Randolph County. At this point the Mississippi, which usually defines the border between Illinois and &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, is entirely in Illinois. The Mississippi changed its course in the late-nineteenth century, leaving Kaskaskia, the former state capital, on the west side of the river. The boundary of the State, however, follows the old course of the river, leaving Illinois with an exclave on the western shore of the Mississippi River. A smaller enclave, Crains Island, is a few miles further down the river.\nClimate and weather.\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Chester have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in January 1985 and a record high of was recorded in July 2012.
