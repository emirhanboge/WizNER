    "text": "Bournemouth Corporation Tramways served the town of &lt;a href=\"Bournemouth\"&gt;Bournemouth&lt;/a&gt; in Dorset (although at the time it was in &lt;a href=\"Hampshire\"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;) from 23 July 1902 until 8 April 1936.\nHistory.\nIn June 1905 the company took a lease on the &lt;a href=\"Poole%20and%20District%20Electric%20Tramways\"&gt;Poole and District Electric Tramways&lt;/a&gt; and a connection was made to this system for through running.\nOn 1 May 1908, a &lt;a href=\"1908%20Bournemouth%20Tramway%20accident\"&gt;tram derailed in Bournemouth Town Centre, killing 7 and injuring 26&lt;/a&gt;.\nUntil May 1911, part of the system was equipped with &lt;a href=\"conduit%20current%20collection\"&gt;conduit current collection&lt;/a&gt; to avoid unsightly overhead wiring on the central section of the tramway. From May 1911, overhead wiring was introduced.\nInfrastructure.\nThe system extended to the suburb of &lt;a href=\"Winton%2C%20Dorset\"&gt;Winton&lt;/a&gt; to the north and to the adjacent towns of &lt;a href=\"Poole\"&gt;Poole&lt;/a&gt; to the west and &lt;a href=\"Christchurch%2C%20Dorset\"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nRoutes were centred on The Square at . The major lines were:\nThere were four depots:\nTramcars.\nThe fleet, in a livery of maroon and yellow, consisted of:\nClosure.\nThe tramway system began its closure in 1929 when motorbuses of Hants and Dorset Motor Services were introduced as a tram replacement on the Lower Parkstone route. In 1933 Bournemouth Corporation began to open trolleybus routes, and in 1936 the remaining tram routes were converted to operation by the &lt;a href=\"Trolleybuses%20in%20Bournemouth\"&gt;trolleybuses of Bournemouth Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreserved tramcars.\nBournemouth tram number 85 is now preserved and on static display at the Crich National tramway museum before its transfer it lived at the Museum of Electricity in Christchurch.\nThe body of car 106 was discovered on a Dorset farm, and eventually presented to &lt;a href=\"Seaton%20Tramway\"&gt;Seaton Tramway&lt;/a&gt; in 1974. Due to the narrow gauge at Seaton (2\u00a0ft 9in/838mm), the body was narrowed and rebuilt as an enclosed single deck saloon. It was launched into service in 1992, bearing the fleet number 16 and a livery closely resembling that of the Bournemouth system."
