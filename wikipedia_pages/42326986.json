    "text": "The 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League was the inaugural season of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Nations%20League\"&gt;UEFA Nations League&lt;/a&gt;, an international &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; competition involving the men's national teams of the 55 member associations of &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt;. The league phase of the competition was played between September and November 2018, with the finals tournament for the group winners from League A taking place in Portugal in June 2019. Team performances in the league phase were used to seed teams for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020%20qualifying\"&gt;qualifying group stage&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and awarded berths in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020%20qualifying%20play-offs\"&gt;play-offs&lt;/a&gt;, which decided four of the twenty-four final tournament slots.\nFormat.\nThe format and schedule of the UEFA Nations League was formally approved by the UEFA Executive Committee on 4 December 2014. According to the approved format, the 55 UEFA national teams were divided into four divisions (called \"leagues\"): 12 teams in League A, 12 teams in League B, 15 teams in League C, and 16 teams in League D. For the 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League, teams were divided according to their &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20national%20team%20coefficient\"&gt;UEFA national team coefficient&lt;/a&gt;s after the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29\"&gt;2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers&lt;/a&gt; (play-off results were not included), with the highest-ranked teams playing in League A, etc.\nEach league was divided into four groups of three or four teams, so each team played four or six matches within their group (using the home-and-away &lt;a href=\"round-robin%20tournament\"&gt;round-robin&lt;/a&gt; format), on double matchdays in September, October and November 2018.\nIn the top division, League A, teams competed to become the UEFA Nations League champions. The four group winners of League A qualified for the Nations League Finals in June 2019, which was played in a knockout format, consisting of the semi-finals, third place play-off, and final. The semi-final pairings, along with the administrative home teams for the third place play-off and final, were determined by means of an open draw on 3 December 2018. Host country Portugal was selected among the four qualified teams on 3 December 2018 by the UEFA Executive Committee, with the winners of the final crowned as the Nations League champions.\nTeams also competed for &lt;a href=\"promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;promotion and relegation&lt;/a&gt; to a higher or lower league. In each league, the four group winners (except League A) were promoted, while the last-placed teams of each group (except League D) were initially to be relegated; the exception was in League C, where due to different sized groups, the three fourth-placed teams and the lowest-ranking third-placed team were initially to be relegated. However, due to a revamp of the format for the 2020\u201321 UEFA Nations League, no teams were eventually relegated, and some second-placed and third-placed teams were also promoted.\nTiebreakers for group ranking.\nIf two or more teams in the same group were equal on points on completion of the league phase, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:\nTo determine the worst third-placed team in League C, the results against the teams in fourth place were discarded. The following criteria were applied:\nCriteria for league ranking.\nIndividual league rankings were established according to the following criteria:\nIn order to rank teams in leagues composed of different sized groups, the following procedure applied:\nThe ranking of the top four teams in League A was determined by their finish in the Nations League Finals (first to fourth).\nCriteria for overall ranking.\nFor the purposes of the European Championship qualifying group stage draw and the European qualifying play-offs, overall UEFA Nations League rankings were established as follows:\nUEFA Euro 2020 qualifying.\nThe 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League was linked with &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020%20qualifying\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying&lt;/a&gt;, providing teams another chance to qualify for &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2020&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main qualifying process began in March 2019 instead of immediately in September 2018 following the &lt;a href=\"2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2018 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and ended in November 2019. The format remained largely the same, although only 20 of the 24 spots for the finals tournament were decided from the main qualifying process, leaving four spots still to be decided. The 55 teams were drawn into 10 groups after the completion of the UEFA Nations League (five groups of five teams and five groups of six teams, with the four UEFA Nations League Finals participants guaranteed to be drawn into groups of five teams), with the top two teams in each group qualifying. The draw seeding was based on the overall rankings of the Nations League. The qualifiers were played on double matchdays in March, June, September, October and November 2019.\nFollowing the qualifying group stage, the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020%20qualifying%20play-offs\"&gt;qualifying play-offs&lt;/a&gt; took place in October and November 2020. Unlike previous editions, the participants of the play-offs were not decided based on results from the qualifying group stage. Instead, 16 teams were selected based on their performance in the Nations League. These teams were divided into four paths, each containing four teams, with one team from each path qualifying for the final tournament. Each league had its own play-off path if at least four teams were available. The Nations League group winners automatically qualified for the play-off path of their league. If a group winner had already qualified through the conventional qualifying group stage, they were replaced by the next best-ranked team in the same league. However, if there were not enough teams in the same league, then the spot would go to the next best team in the overall ranking. However, group winners could not face teams from a higher league.\nEach play-off path featured two single-leg semi-finals, and one single-leg final. The best-ranked team hosted the fourth-ranked team, and the second-ranked team hosted the third-ranked team. The host of the final was decided by a draw, with semi-final winner 1 or 2 hosting the final. The four play-off path winners joined the 20 teams which had already qualified for UEFA Euro 2020.\nSchedule.\nBelow was the schedule of the 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League.\nThe fixture list was confirmed by UEFA on 24 January 2018 following the draw.\nSeeding.\nAll 55 UEFA national teams were eligible to compete in the 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League. The 55 members at the time were divided into the four \"Leagues\" (12 teams in League A, 12 teams in League B, 15 teams in League C, and 16 teams in League D) according to their &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20national%20team%20coefficient\"&gt;UEFA national team coefficient&lt;/a&gt;s after the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29\"&gt;2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers&lt;/a&gt; (not including the play-offs), with the highest-ranked teams playing in League A, etc. The seeding pots for the draw were announced on 7 December 2017.\nThe draw for the league phase took place at the &lt;a href=\"SwissTech%20Convention%20Center\"&gt;SwissTech Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lausanne\"&gt;Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland on 24 January 2018, 12:00 &lt;a href=\"Central%20European%20Time\"&gt;CET&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor political reasons, Armenia and Azerbaijan (due to the &lt;a href=\"Nagorno-Karabakh%20conflict\"&gt;Nagorno-Karabakh conflict&lt;/a&gt;), as well as Russia and Ukraine (due to the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20military%20intervention%20in%20Ukraine%20%282014%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;Russian military intervention in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;), could not be drawn in the same group. Due to winter venue restrictions, a group could contain a maximum of two of the following teams: Norway, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania. Due to excessive travel restrictions, any group could contain a maximum of one of the following pairs: Andorra and Kazakhstan, Faroe Islands and Kazakhstan, Gibraltar and Kazakhstan, Gibraltar and Azerbaijan.\nOverall ranking.\nThe overall ranking was used for seeding in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020%20qualifying%23Draw\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying group stage&lt;/a&gt; draw.\nPrize money.\nThe prize money to be distributed was announced in March 2018, with a total of \u20ac76.25\u00a0million in solidarity and bonus fees due to be distributed to the 55 participating national teams. However, in October 2018, the solidarity fees and bonus payments for group winners were increased by 50%, while the bonuses for the teams appearing in the Nations League Finals also increased, resulting in a total of \u20ac112.875\u00a0million in prize money.\nThe solidarity fees per team were scaled by league:\nIn addition, the group winners of each league received the following bonus fees:\nThe four group winners of League A, which participated in the Nations League Finals, also received the following bonus fees based on performance:\nThis meant that the maximum amount of solidarity and bonus fees was \u20ac10.5\u00a0million for a team from League A, \u20ac3\u00a0million for a team from League B, \u20ac2.25\u00a0million for a team from League C, and \u20ac1.5\u00a0million for a team from League D.\nEuro 2020 qualifying play-offs.\nTeams who failed in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020%20qualifying\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying&lt;/a&gt; group stage could still qualify for the final tournament via the play-offs. Each league in the UEFA Nations League was allocated one of the four remaining UEFA Euro 2020 places. Four teams from each league who had not already qualified for the European Championship finals competed in the play-offs of their league, which were played in October and November 2020. The play-off berths were first allocated to each group winner, and if any of the group winners had already qualified for the European Championship finals, then to the next best ranked team of the league, etc."
