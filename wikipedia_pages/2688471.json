    "text": "Bromley Football Club is a professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Bromley\"&gt;Bromley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20London\"&gt;Greater London&lt;/a&gt;, England. They are currently members of and play at &lt;a href=\"Hayes%20Lane\"&gt;Hayes Lane&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEstablished in 1892, Bromley initially played in the South London League, before becoming founder members of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt; in 1894, joining Division Two. However, after finishing bottom of Division Two in &lt;a href=\"1895%E2%80%9396%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;1895\u201396&lt;/a&gt; they left to become founder members of the &lt;a href=\"London%20League%20%28football%29\"&gt;London League&lt;/a&gt;, also joining Division Two. They won the division at the first attempt, and were promoted to Division One. They switched to the &lt;a href=\"Kent%20Football%20League%20%281894%E2%80%931959%29\"&gt;Kent League&lt;/a&gt; for the 1898\u201399 season, but after finishing bottom of the league, they returned to Division One of the London League. During the 1899\u20131900 season the club withdrew from Division One, taking over their reserves' fixtures in Division Two. They withdrew from Division Two at the end of the 1900\u201301 season.\nIn 1907 the club were founder members of the &lt;a href=\"Spartan%20League\"&gt;Spartan League&lt;/a&gt; and went on to become its inaugural champions. They joined the &lt;a href=\"Isthmian%20League\"&gt;Isthmian League&lt;/a&gt; for the following season, and won back-to-back titles in &lt;a href=\"1908%E2%80%9309%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;1908\u201309&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1909%E2%80%9310%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;1909\u201310&lt;/a&gt;. In 1910\u201311 the club won the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Amateur%20Cup\"&gt;FA Amateur Cup&lt;/a&gt;, beating &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Auckland%20F.C.\"&gt;Bishop Auckland&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the final. The season also saw them finish seventh in &lt;a href=\"1910%E2%80%9311%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;1910\u201311&lt;/a&gt;, the club returned to the Kent League and were placed in Division One. They remained in the league until &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, but joined the &lt;a href=\"Athenian%20League\"&gt;Athenian League&lt;/a&gt; when football resumed in 1919. The club were Athenian League champions in 1922\u201323. In &lt;a href=\"1937%E2%80%9338%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;1937\u201338&lt;/a&gt; they reached the first round of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. After beating &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Lynn%20F.C.\"&gt;King's Lynn&lt;/a&gt; in the first round, they lost 4\u20131 at &lt;a href=\"Scarborough%20F.C.\"&gt;Scarborough&lt;/a&gt; in the second. They also reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup again, beating &lt;a href=\"Erith%20%26amp%3B%20Belvedere%20F.C.\"&gt;Erith &amp; Belvedere&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130. The club repeated the feat the &lt;a href=\"1938%E2%80%9339%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt;, this time playing Football League opposition for the first time as they lost 8\u20131 at &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Lincoln City&lt;/a&gt; in the second round. In &lt;a href=\"1945%E2%80%9346%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;1945\u201346&lt;/a&gt; another second round appearance resulted in a 4\u20132 aggregate defeat to &lt;a href=\"Watford%20F.C.\"&gt;Watford&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1947%E2%80%9348%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;1947\u201348&lt;/a&gt; they held &lt;a href=\"Reading%20F.C.\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt; to a 1\u20131 draw in the first round, before losing the replay at &lt;a href=\"Elm%20Park%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;Elm Park&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130.\nThe club won another Athenian League title and the FA Amateur Cup in 1948\u201349, with the following season seeing another FA first round defeat, this time 2\u20131 to Watford. In 1950\u201351 the club won their third Athenian League title; the season also saw them lose 1\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Aldershot%20F.C.\"&gt;Aldershot&lt;/a&gt; in the FA Cup first round. Going straight into the first round the &lt;a href=\"1951%E2%80%9352%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt;, they lost 3\u20132 at &lt;a href=\"Torquay%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Torquay United&lt;/a&gt;. In 1952 they rejoined the Isthmian League, and after finishing as runners-up in their &lt;a href=\"1952%E2%80%9353%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;first season&lt;/a&gt; back in the league, they were champions in &lt;a href=\"1953%E2%80%9354%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;1953\u201354&lt;/a&gt;. They won the league for a fourth time in 1960\u201361.\nAfter finishing bottom of Division One in the &lt;a href=\"1974%E2%80%9375%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;1974\u201375&lt;/a&gt; season Bromley were relegated to Division Two. In &lt;a href=\"1976%E2%80%9377%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;1976\u201377&lt;/a&gt; the club appeared in the FA Cup first round for the first time in over twenty years, losing 7\u20130 at &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt;. Division Two became Division One in 1977, and the club were promoted to the Premier Division after finishing as runners-up in &lt;a href=\"1979%E2%80%9380%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;1979\u201380&lt;/a&gt;. They were relegated to Division One again in &lt;a href=\"1983%E2%80%9384%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;1983\u201384&lt;/a&gt;, but returned to the Premier Division as Division One runners-up in &lt;a href=\"1985%E2%80%9386%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;1985\u201386&lt;/a&gt;. Another relegation followed in &lt;a href=\"1989%E2%80%9390%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;1989\u201390&lt;/a&gt;, but was followed by an immediate return to the Premier Division as Division One runners-up in &lt;a href=\"1990%E2%80%9391%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;1990\u201391&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;1996\u201397&lt;/a&gt; they qualified for the FA Cup first round again, but were beaten 3\u20131 at home by &lt;a href=\"Enfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Enfield&lt;/a&gt;.\nBromley were relegated to Division One again at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;1998\u201399 season&lt;/a&gt;; non-league reorganisation in 2004 saw Division One become the eighth rather than seventh tier of the football pyramid. A fourth-place finish that season saw them qualify for the promotion play-offs, and after defeating &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Police%20F.C.\"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; on penalties in the semi-finals, they beat &lt;a href=\"Horsham%20F.C.\"&gt;Horsham&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131 in the final to earn promotion to the Premier Division. In &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Isthmian%20League\"&gt;2006\u201307&lt;/a&gt; they finished as runners-up in the Premier Division, again qualifying for the promotion play-offs. A 1\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Wimbledon\"&gt;AFC Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; in the semi-finals and a victory against &lt;a href=\"Billericay%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Billericay Town&lt;/a&gt; on penalties in the final saw them promoted to the Conference South. The season had also seen them reach the FA Cup first round again, eventually losing 4\u20131 at &lt;a href=\"Gillingham%20F.C.\"&gt;Gillingham&lt;/a&gt;. Further appearances in the first round were achieved in 2009\u201310 (against &lt;a href=\"Colchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Colchester United&lt;/a&gt;), 2011\u201312 (&lt;a href=\"Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.\"&gt;Leyton Orient&lt;/a&gt;), 2012\u201313 (&lt;a href=\"Fleetwood%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Fleetwood Town&lt;/a&gt;) and 2014\u201315 (&lt;a href=\"Dartford%20F.C.\"&gt;Dartford&lt;/a&gt;), but they were beaten on each occasion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2014\u201315&lt;/a&gt; Bromley won the Conference South, earning promotion to the renamed National League, where they have remained since. Another FA Cup first round appearance in &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20FA%20Cup\"&gt;2017\u201318&lt;/a&gt; saw them defeated by &lt;a href=\"Rochdale%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Rochdale&lt;/a&gt;. The season also saw them reach the final of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Trophy\"&gt;FA Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, where they lost 5\u20134 on penalties to &lt;a href=\"Brackley%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Brackley Town&lt;/a&gt; after the match had ended in a 1\u20131 draw.\nGround.\nThe club initially played at the Queensmead Recreation Ground, before moving to Glebe Road. Seven years later they moved to the Plaistow Cricket Club ground when Glebe Road was bought for use as housing. However, the cricket club's ground was also obtained for housing in 1904, leading to the football club (and the other sports club using the ground) to move to a site on Hayes Lane. The new ground was opened on 3 September 1904.\nIn 1938 the club moved to the current Hayes Lane ground. The record attendance of 10,798 was set during a game against a &lt;a href=\"Nigeria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Nigeria XI&lt;/a&gt; in September 1948. The ground currently has a capacity of 5,000, of which 1,300 is seated and 2,500 is covered.\nClub personnel.\n\"As of 5 August 2019\"\nIn popular culture.\nLifelong fan Dave Roberts has written several books on his experiences following Bromley FC: \"The Bromley Boys\" (2008), \"32 Programmes\" (2011) and \"Home and Away\" (2016). \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bromley%20Boys\"&gt;The Bromley Boys&lt;/a&gt;\" has also been made into a film available on DVD and via streaming, starring &lt;a href=\"Martine%20McCutcheon\"&gt;Martine McCutcheon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Davies\"&gt;Alan Davies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Foreman\"&gt;Jamie Foreman&lt;/a&gt;."
