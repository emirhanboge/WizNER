    "title": "Play (Moby album)",
    "text": "Play is the fifth &lt;a href=\"studio%20album\"&gt;studio album&lt;/a&gt; by American &lt;a href=\"electronic%20music\"&gt;electronic&lt;/a&gt; musician &lt;a href=\"Moby\"&gt;Moby&lt;/a&gt;. It was released on May 17, 1999, through &lt;a href=\"Mute%20Records\"&gt;Mute Records&lt;/a&gt; internationally and &lt;a href=\"V2%20Records\"&gt;V2 Records&lt;/a&gt; in North America. Recording of the album began in mid-1997, following the release of Moby's fourth album, \"&lt;a href=\"Animal%20Rights%20%28album%29\"&gt;Animal Rights&lt;/a&gt;\" (1996), which deviated from his &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt; style; Moby's goal for \"Play\" was to return to this style of music. Originally intended to be his final record, the album was recorded at Moby's home studio in &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, New York.\nWhile some of Moby's earlier work had garnered critical and commercial success within the &lt;a href=\"electronic%20dance%20music\"&gt;electronic dance music&lt;/a&gt; scene, \"Play\" was both a critical success and a commercial phenomenon. Initially issued to lackluster sales, it topped numerous album charts months after its release and was &lt;a href=\"music%20recording%20certification\"&gt;certified&lt;/a&gt; platinum in more than 20 countries. The album introduced Moby to a worldwide mainstream audience, not only through a large number of hit singles that helped the album to dominate worldwide charts for two years, but also through unprecedented licensing of its songs in films, television shows, and commercials. \"Play\" eventually became the biggest-selling electronica album of all time, with over 12 million copies sold worldwide.\nIn 2003 and 2012, \"Play\" was ranked number 341 on \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine's list of &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time\"&gt;the 500 greatest albums of all time&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe second half of the 1990s saw Moby in career turmoil after years of success in the &lt;a href=\"techno\"&gt;techno&lt;/a&gt; scene. The release in 1996 of \"&lt;a href=\"Animal%20Rights%20%28album%29\"&gt;Animal Rights&lt;/a&gt;\", a dark, eclectic, guitar-fueled record built around the &lt;a href=\"punk%20rock\"&gt;punk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt; records that he loved as a teenager, proved a critical and commercial disaster that left him contemplating quitting music altogether. He explained: \"I was opening for &lt;a href=\"Soundgarden\"&gt;Soundgarden&lt;/a&gt; and getting shit thrown at me every night onstage. I did my own tour and was playing to roughly fifty people a night.\" However, positive reactions to \"Animal Rights\" from fellow artists such as &lt;a href=\"Terence%20Trent%20D%27Arby\"&gt;Terence Trent D'Arby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Axl%20Rose\"&gt;Axl Rose&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bono\"&gt;Bono&lt;/a&gt; inspired Moby to continue producing music.\nMoby started work on \"Play\" in August 1997 and put it on hold several times to complete touring obligations. At the time, he planned on making the album his last before ending his career. Recording sessions took place at Moby's &lt;a href=\"Mott%20Street\"&gt;Mott Street&lt;/a&gt; home studio in &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, New York. \"Play\" was delayed due to Moby's dissatisfaction with the initial mix of the album that he had produced at home. A second mixing was completed at an outside studio before attempts at two other studios displayed similar results. After returning home and producing a mix by himself, Moby felt happy with it. Ultimately, he said that he \"wasted a lot of time and money\" on the previous unsatisfactory mixing sessions. Moby recalled a moment from March 1999, after \"Play\" had been mixed and sequenced, where he sat on the grass in &lt;a href=\"Sara%20Delano%20Roosevelt%20Park\"&gt;Sara Delano Roosevelt Park&lt;/a&gt;: \"I was sitting by the little tire swings that had been chewed apart by the pit bulls [...] thinking to myself, 'When this record comes out, it will be the end of my career. I should start thinking about what else I can do.'\" At that point, he considered returning to school to study architecture.\nWhen Moby finished recording \"Play\", there was no sign that the album would perform any differently than \"Animal Rights\". While he remained signed to the label &lt;a href=\"Mute%20Records\"&gt;Mute&lt;/a&gt;, which issued his records in the United Kingdom, &lt;a href=\"Elektra%20Records\"&gt;Elektra&lt;/a&gt; had dropped him from its roster of artists following the release of \"Animal Rights\", leaving him without an outlet to release \"Play\" in the United States. According to Moby, he shopped the record to every major label, from &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Records\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sony%20Music\"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"RCA%20Records\"&gt;RCA&lt;/a&gt;, and was rejected every time. After &lt;a href=\"V2%20Records\"&gt;V2&lt;/a&gt; finally picked it up, his publicist sent the record to journalists, many of whom declined to listen to it. Moby's manager Eric H\u00e4rle said that their original goal was to sell 250,000 copies, which was what \"&lt;a href=\"Everything%20Is%20Wrong%20%28album%29\"&gt;Everything Is Wrong&lt;/a&gt;\" (1995), Moby's biggest-selling album at the time, had sold.\nMusic.\nAccording to \"&lt;a href=\"Spin%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine's &lt;a href=\"Will%20Hermes\"&gt;Will Hermes&lt;/a&gt;, \"Play\" was \"the high-water mark for populist &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt;\" and a \"millennial &lt;a href=\"American%20folk%20music\"&gt;roots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt; masterwork\", while John Bush from &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; said it balanced Moby's early electronica sound with the emergent &lt;a href=\"breakbeat\"&gt;breakbeat&lt;/a&gt; style of techno. \"&lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Sun-Times\"&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/a&gt;\" critic &lt;a href=\"Jim%20DeRogatis\"&gt;Jim DeRogatis&lt;/a&gt; noted its incorporation of such disparate musical influences as early blues, African-American &lt;a href=\"American%20folk%20music\"&gt;folk music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gospel%20music\"&gt;gospel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hip%20hop%20music\"&gt;hip hop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt;, and techno, \"all within the context of his own distinctly melodic &lt;a href=\"ambient%20music\"&gt;ambient&lt;/a&gt; stylings.\" \"&lt;a href=\"Complex%20Networks\"&gt;Complex&lt;/a&gt;\" described \"Play\" as \"an organic &lt;a href=\"downtempo\"&gt;downtempo&lt;/a&gt; masterpiece\" that fused live studio recordings and \"&lt;a href=\"sampling%20%28music%29\"&gt;found sounds&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Play\" was particularly notable for its use of &lt;a href=\"sampling%20%28music%29\"&gt;samples&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"field%20recording\"&gt;field recording&lt;/a&gt;s collected by &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Lomax\"&gt;Alan Lomax&lt;/a&gt; and compiled on the 1993 &lt;a href=\"box%20set\"&gt;box set&lt;/a&gt; \"Sounds of the South: A Musical Journey from the Georgia Sea Islands to the Mississippi Delta\". Moby was introduced to the box set through a friend, Gregor Ehrlich, who loaned the CDs to him. The \"Play\" tracks \"&lt;a href=\"Honey%20%28Moby%20song%29\"&gt;Honey&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Find%20My%20Baby\"&gt;Find My Baby&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Natural%20Blues\"&gt;Natural Blues&lt;/a&gt;\" were composed by Moby around vocal &lt;a href=\"hook%20%28music%29\"&gt;hooks&lt;/a&gt; sampled from songs by the folk singers &lt;a href=\"Bessie%20Jones%20%28American%20singer%29\"&gt;Bessie Jones&lt;/a&gt;, Boy Blue, and &lt;a href=\"Vera%20Hall\"&gt;Vera Hall&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, that were featured on the collection. Apart from the Lomax material, Moby also used samples of old gospel recordings on \"&lt;a href=\"Why%20Does%20My%20Heart%20Feel%20So%20Bad%3F\"&gt;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Run%20On%20%28Moby%20song%29\"&gt;Run On&lt;/a&gt;\". In the liner notes for \"Play\", Moby gave \"special thanks to the Lomaxes and all of the archivists and music historians whose field recordings made this record possible.\"\nElsewhere, \"Play\" is informed by more contemporary music styles. \"&lt;a href=\"Bodyrock%20%28song%29\"&gt;Bodyrock&lt;/a&gt;\", which Moby called \"essentially a hip-hop song\", features samples of rappers &lt;a href=\"Spoonie%20Gee\"&gt;Spoonie Gee&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Treacherous%20Three\"&gt;Treacherous Three&lt;/a&gt;. \"Machete\" was inspired by &lt;a href=\"electronic%20body%20music\"&gt;EBM&lt;/a&gt; acts such as &lt;a href=\"Front%20242\"&gt;Front 242&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meat%20Beat%20Manifesto\"&gt;Meat Beat Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Porcelain%20%28song%29\"&gt;Porcelain&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"South%20Side%20%28song%29\"&gt;South Side&lt;/a&gt;\" are both anchored by Moby's own lead vocals, and are among several songs on the album that spotlight his trademark \"evocative, melancholy\" techno sound, according to Bush. The remaining tracks are primarily instrumental in nature, and Moby cited these as his favorites from \"Play\". The latter half of the album is mostly composed of these instrumentals, which are more downcast in mood and less driven by samples. Moby noted that he intentionally sequenced the album such that \"it starts off energetic and then by the end dissolves into an opiated haze.\"\nRelease and promotion.\n\"Play\" was released on May 17, 1999 by Mute, and on June 1, 1999 by V2. On its release, it underperformed commercially. The record debuted at number 33 on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Albums%20Chart\"&gt;UK Albums Chart&lt;/a&gt;, but thereafter descended the chart. Moby recounted that the first show he played in support of \"Play\", at the basement of the &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Megastores\"&gt;Virgin Megastore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Union%20Square%2C%20Manhattan\"&gt;Union Square&lt;/a&gt;, was attended by only around 40 people. Further damaging the album's commercial prospects, \"Play\"s songs received little airplay from radio stations or television networks such as &lt;a href=\"MTV\"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoby and his management, however, soon found another approach to increasing public exposure of \"Play\", by way of licensing its songs for use in films, television shows, and commercials. According to Moby, their goal \"was simply to get people to hear the music\". \"Most of the licenses weren't particularly lucrative,\" he noted, \"but they enabled people to hear the music because otherwise the record wasn't being heard.\" Eric H\u00e4rle clarified that although many people believed the songs were pitched for advertisements as part of the marketing campaign for an album that did not fit with mainstream radio, the licensing actually came about as a result of agencies asking for permission to use the music as soundbeds; he attributed the music's popularity to its evocative and emotional nature. Despite the heavy licensing, each request was nevertheless carefully vetted and more requests were turned down than accepted. Moby's manager Barry Taylor recalled that after the producers of a British television program sent a fax requesting for permission to use \"7\", the only track from \"Play\" that had yet to be licensed, \"we celebrated.\"\nThe licensing approach proved successful in increasing \"Play\"s visibility, and subsequently radio and MTV airplay for the album's songs began to pick up. The album re-entered the top 100 of the UK Albums Chart in January 2000, slowly climbing positions and finally reaching number one three months later, spending five weeks at the top. It remained on the chart for the remainder of 2000, and in the UK was the fifth best-selling album, as well as the best-selling &lt;a href=\"independent%20record%20label\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; album, of that year. By October 2000, \"Play\" had attained platinum &lt;a href=\"music%20recording%20certification\"&gt;certifications&lt;/a&gt; in 17 countries and topped the charts in seven. While it only reached number 38 on the American &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20200\"&gt;\"Billboard\" 200&lt;/a&gt; chart, the album sold over two million copies in the US, enjoying steady sales for months and constant popularity. \"Play\" has been certified platinum in more than 20 countries, and with over 12 million copies sold worldwide, it is the biggest-selling electronica album of all time.\nEight singles were released from \"Play\": \"Honey\" on August 24, 1998, \"Run On\" on April 26, 1999, \"Bodyrock\" on July 12, 1999, \"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?\" on October 11, 1999, \"Natural Blues\" on March 6, 2000, \"Porcelain\" on April 25, 2000, \"South Side\" on October 10, 2000, and \"Find My Baby\" on October 16, 2000. The first six all reached the top 40 of the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. \"South Side\", which for its single release was remixed to include additional vocals from &lt;a href=\"No%20Doubt\"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/a&gt; singer &lt;a href=\"Gwen%20Stefani\"&gt;Gwen Stefani&lt;/a&gt;, became Moby's first single to chart on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;, where it peaked at number 14. Numerous &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt;s were commissioned for the album's singles, directed by filmmakers such as &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20%C3%85kerlund\"&gt;Jonas \u00c5kerlund&lt;/a&gt; (\"Porcelain\"), &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Coppola\"&gt;Roman Coppola&lt;/a&gt; (\"Honey\"), &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Kahn\"&gt;Joseph Kahn&lt;/a&gt; (\"South Side\"), and &lt;a href=\"David%20LaChapelle\"&gt;David LaChapelle&lt;/a&gt; (\"Natural Blues\").\nIn October 2000, the &lt;a href=\"compilation%20album\"&gt;compilation album&lt;/a&gt; \"\" was released, containing tracks released as &lt;a href=\"A-side%20and%20B-side\"&gt;B-sides&lt;/a&gt; on the singles from \"Play\". A &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; titled \"Play: The DVD\" was released in July 2001. It features most of the music videos for \"Play\"s singles; an 88-minute &lt;a href=\"megamix\"&gt;megamix&lt;/a&gt; of various remixes of the album's songs, accompanied by animated visuals; a performance by Moby on \"&lt;a href=\"Later...%20with%20Jools%20Holland\"&gt;Later... with Jools Holland&lt;/a&gt;\"; a compilation of footage shot by Moby on tour titled \"Give an Idiot a Camcorder\"; an interactive component that allows users to remix \"Bodyrock\" and \"Natural Blues\"; and a bonus CD containing the aforementioned megamix. \"Play: The DVD\" was nominated for &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Music%20Film\"&gt;Best Long Form Music Video&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"44th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;44th Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritical reception.\n\"Play\" received widespread critical acclaim upon release. On &lt;a href=\"Metacritic\"&gt;Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, which assigns a &lt;a href=\"standard%20score\"&gt;normalized&lt;/a&gt; rating to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has a score of 84 out of 100 based on 20 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nReviewing for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Village%20Voice\"&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1999, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Christgau\"&gt;Robert Christgau&lt;/a&gt; said the album's sampled recordings would not \"shout anywhere near as loud and clear\" without Moby's \"ministrations\u2014his grooves, his pacing, his textures, his harmonies, sometimes his tunes, and mostly his grooves, which honor not just &lt;a href=\"electronic%20dance%20music\"&gt;dance music&lt;/a&gt; but the entire &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; tradition it's part of.\" He deemed the album \"no more focused\" than Moby's previous \"brilliant messes\" but still \"one of those records whose drive to beauty should move anybody who just likes, well, music itself.\" In his review for AllMusic, John Bush stated that \"Play\" showed Moby \"balancing his sublime early sound with the breakbeat techno evolution of the '90s.\" Barry Walters from \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" said \"the ebb and flow of eighteen concise, contrasting cuts writes a story about Moby's beautifully conflicted interior world while giving the outside planet beats and tunes on which to groove.\" &lt;a href=\"David%20Browne%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;David Browne&lt;/a&gt;, writing in \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\", felt that despite some needed editing, Moby's graceful soundscapes filter out the original recordings' antiquated sound and \"make the singers' heartache and hope seem fresh again.\" In a more critical appraisal, \"&lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20%28website%29\"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;\" reviewer Brent DiCrescenzo believed the \"raw magnetism\" of the sampled recordings was lost to \"innate digital recording techniques\", resulting in music that was \"fun and functional, yet disposable.\"\nAt the end of 1999, \"Play\" was voted the year's best album in the &lt;a href=\"Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop\"&gt;Pazz &amp; Jop&lt;/a&gt;, an annual poll of American critics published in \"The Village Voice\". Christgau, the poll's supervisor, ranked it second best on his own year-end list. The following year, the album was nominated for &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album\"&gt;Best Alternative Music Performance&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"42nd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;42nd Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, it has frequently been named one of the greatest albums of all time; according to &lt;a href=\"Acclaimed%20Music\"&gt;Acclaimed Music&lt;/a&gt;, it is the 340th most ranked record on critics' all-time lists. &lt;a href=\"NPR\"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; named \"Play\" one of the 300 most important American records of the 20th century, as determined by the network's news and cultural programming staff, prominent critics, and scholars. It was ranked number 341 on \"Rolling Stone\"s 2003 and 2012 lists of &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time\"&gt;the 500 greatest albums of all time&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2005, a panel of recording industry pundits assembled by &lt;a href=\"Channel%204\"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt; voted \"Play\" the 63rd-best album ever. The album was also included in the book \"&lt;a href=\"1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die\"&gt;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLegacy.\nAccording to \"Rolling Stone\", \"\"Play\" wasn't the first album to make a rock star out of an insular techno nerdnik, but it was the first to make one a pop sensation. [...] \"Play\" made &lt;a href=\"postmodernism\"&gt;postmodernism&lt;/a&gt; cuddly, slowly but surely striking a chord with critics and record-buyers alike.\" \"&lt;a href=\"Wired%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;\" said that the songs on \"Play\"\u2014which became the first album ever to have all of its tracks licensed for use in films, television shows, or commercials\u2014\"have been sold hundreds of times [...] a licensing venture so staggeringly lucrative that the album was a financial success months before it reached its multi-platinum sales total.\" In a retrospective piece for \"&lt;a href=\"eMusic\"&gt;Wondering Sound&lt;/a&gt;\", Robert Christgau wrote:\nEnglish singer-songwriter &lt;a href=\"Adele\"&gt;Adele&lt;/a&gt; cited \"Play\" as an influence on her 2015 album \"&lt;a href=\"25%20%28Adele%20album%29\"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;\", saying: \"There's something that I find really holy about that \"Play\" album... The way it makes me feel. Even though there's nothing holy or preachy about it. There's just something about it\u2014maybe the gospel samples. But it makes me feel alive, that album, still. And I remember my mum having that record.\"\nTrack listing.\nSample credits\nPersonnel.\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes."
