    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Corporation\"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt; QT-8B Micro Compet, a portable electronic desktop &lt;a href=\"calculator\"&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt;, was the first mass-produced calculator to be battery-powered. Introduced in mid-1970, it was based on its immediate predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20QT-8D\"&gt;QT-8D&lt;/a&gt; introduced in late 1969, but it replaced the QT-8D's integrated &lt;a href=\"power%20supply\"&gt;power supply&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Rechargeable%20battery\"&gt;rechargeable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battery%20pack\"&gt;battery pack&lt;/a&gt;. It has the same calculating &lt;a href=\"integrated%20circuits\"&gt;integrated circuits&lt;/a&gt; as the QT-8D and is of similar appearance and dimensions; the power supply is the only major difference.\nThe QT-8B's release price in Japan was 117,000 &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20yen\"&gt;yen&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. price in mid-1971 was $495, equivalent to about $2,700 in 2010. These prices were somewhat higher than those for the preceding QT-8D.\nThe QT-8B's battery pack contains six &lt;a href=\"Nickel-cadmium%20battery\"&gt;nickel-cadmium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%20battery\"&gt;C batteries&lt;/a&gt; connected in &lt;a href=\"Series%20and%20parallel%20circuits\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, giving a total &lt;a href=\"voltage\"&gt;voltage&lt;/a&gt; of 7.5 &lt;a href=\"volt\"&gt;volt&lt;/a&gt;s and, with the original batteries, a total capacity of 1200 &lt;a href=\"milliampere-hour\"&gt;milliampere-hour&lt;/a&gt;s. (Modern nickel-cadmium C batteries have much greater capacity.)\nFor recharging, the calculator accepts 12-volt &lt;a href=\"Direct%20current\"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt; external power, with an input power rating of 6.5 &lt;a href=\"watt\"&gt;watt&lt;/a&gt;s. Normally the calculator is recharged from &lt;a href=\"Mains%20electricity\"&gt;AC power&lt;/a&gt; by plugging it into an external charging station (model QTA-2) which is a little longer than the calculator and has a plug that fits into the calculator's charging socket. The calculator sits on top of the base of this charging station and can be used while charging; it can also be locked into the station for extra stability. An adapter for using &lt;a href=\"Cigarette%20lighter%20receptacle\"&gt;12-volt DC automobile power&lt;/a&gt; was also available.\nThere is a slight difference between the QT-8D and the QT-8B in the operation of the right-hand display tube, which contains both a minus-sign indicator and a large dot. On the QT-8D, this dot is used as an overflow error indicator. But on the QT-8B, it acts as a low-battery indicator; overflow errors are signalled by displaying all zeroes with all the decimal point indicators lit.\nSharp made an &lt;a href=\"OEM\"&gt;OEM&lt;/a&gt; version of the QT-8B for &lt;a href=\"Burroughs%20Corporation\"&gt;Burroughs&lt;/a&gt;, the Burroughs C3146, which has some significant differences from Sharp's own version. The QT-8B needs an external station for recharging its batteries and for AC operation, but the C3146 has its AC power supply built in, along with the batteries and charging electronics, and can thus be plugged directly into AC power. Since the C3146 has both a battery pack and an AC power supply, it also has a larger case to accommodate them. Like the Sharp, the Burroughs machine can also use 12-volt DC automobile power via an adapter. Otherwise, the C3146's electronics are identical to those of the QT-8B."
