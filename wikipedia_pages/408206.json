    "text": "The Communist Party of India (Marxist) (abbreviated as CPI(M)/CPIM/CPM) is a &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20India\"&gt;political party&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20India%23National%20parties\"&gt;national parties&lt;/a&gt; of India. The party emerged from a split from the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India\"&gt;Communist Party of India&lt;/a&gt; (CPI) on 7 November, 1964.\n CPI(M) is leading the state government in &lt;a href=\"Kerala\"&gt;Kerala&lt;/a&gt; and has representation in the following Legislative assemblies in the states of &lt;a href=\"Tripura\"&gt;Tripura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rajasthan\"&gt;Rajasthan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bihar\"&gt;Bihar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Himachal%20Pradesh\"&gt;Himachal Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Odisha\"&gt;Odisha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maharashtra\"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe All-India Party Congress is the supreme authority of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). However, in between two party congresses, the Central Committee is the highest decision making body. The Central Committee shall elect from among its members a &lt;a href=\"Politburo%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%29\"&gt;Polit Bureau&lt;/a&gt; including the General Secretary. The Polit Bureau carries on the work of the Central Committee between its two sessions and has the right to take political and organisational decisions in between two meetings of the Central Committee.\nName.\nCPI(M) is officially known as () in Hindi, but it is often known as (, abbreviated \"MaKaPa\") in press and media circles. During its initial years after the split, the party was often referred to by different names such as 'Left Communist Party' or 'Communist Party of India (Left)'. The party has used the name 'Left' because CPI people were dubbed as a rightist in nature for their support of the Congress-Nehru regime. During the Kerala Legislative Assembly elections of 1965, the party adopted the name 'Communist Party of India (Marxist)' and applied to obtain its election symbol from the &lt;a href=\"Election%20Commission%20of%20India\"&gt;Election Commission of India&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Communist Party of India (Marxist) emerged from a division within the Communist Party of India, which was formed on 26 December 1925. The CPI had experienced a period of upsurge during the years following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;. The CPI led armed rebellions in &lt;a href=\"Telangana%20Rebellion\"&gt;Telangana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tripura%20%28princely%20state%29\"&gt;Tripura&lt;/a&gt;, and Kerala. However, it soon abandoned the strategy of armed revolution in favor of working within the &lt;a href=\"parliamentary\"&gt;parliamentary&lt;/a&gt; framework. In 1950, &lt;a href=\"B.%20T.%20Ranadive\"&gt;B. T. Ranadive&lt;/a&gt;, the CPI general secretary and a prominent representative of the radical sector inside the party, was demoted on grounds of left-adventurism. \nUnder the government of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt; party of &lt;a href=\"Jawaharlal%20Nehru\"&gt;Jawaharlal Nehru&lt;/a&gt;, independent India developed close relations and a strategic partnership with the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. The Soviet government consequently wished that the Indian communists moderate their criticism towards the Indian state and assume a supportive role towards the Congress governments. However, large sections of the CPI claimed that India remained a semi-&lt;a href=\"feudal\"&gt;feudal&lt;/a&gt; country and that &lt;a href=\"class%20struggle\"&gt;class struggle&lt;/a&gt; could not be put on the back-burner for the sake of guarding the interests of Soviet trade and foreign policy. Moreover, the Indian National Congress appeared to be generally hostile towards political competition. In 1959 the central government intervened to impose &lt;a href=\"President%27s%20Rule\"&gt;President's Rule&lt;/a&gt; in Kerala, toppling the &lt;a href=\"E.M.S.%20Namboodiripad\"&gt;E.M.S. Namboodiripad&lt;/a&gt; cabinet (the sole non-Congress state government in the country).\nHistory.\nFormation of CPI(M) (1964).\nThe basis of difference in opinion between the two factions in CPI was ideological \u2013 about the assessment of the Indian scenario and the development of a party program. This difference in opinion was also a reflection of a similar difference of international level on ideology between the Soviet and Chinese Communist parties. The alleged 'right-wing' inside the party followed the Soviet path whereas the 'left-wing' wanted to follow the Chinese principle of a &lt;a href=\"Mass%20line\"&gt;mass party with a class line&lt;/a&gt; with national characteristics. Moreover, the faction of CPI which later became CPI(M) referred to the \"right\" strategy as a national approach of class collaboration, a damning charge within the communist movement where the prioritization of working-class interests and independence is considered paramount.\nIt was this ideological difference which later intensified, coupled with the Soviet-Chinese split at the international level and ultimately gave birth to CPI(M).\nHundreds of CPI leaders, accused of being pro-Chinese, were imprisoned. Thousands of Communists were detained without trial.\nIn 1962 &lt;a href=\"Ajoy%20Ghosh\"&gt;Ajoy Ghosh&lt;/a&gt;, the general secretary of the CPI died. After his death, &lt;a href=\"S.A.%20Dange\"&gt;S.A. Dange&lt;/a&gt; was installed as the party chairman (a new position) and E.M.S. Namboodiripad as general secretary. This was an attempt to achieve a compromise.\nAt a CPI National Council meeting held on 11 April 1964, 32 Council members walked out.\nThe leftist section, to which the 32 National Council members belonged, organized a convention in &lt;a href=\"Tenali\"&gt;Tenali&lt;/a&gt;, Andhra Pradesh 7 to 11 July. In this convention, the issues of the internal disputes in the party were discussed. 146 delegates, claiming to represent 100,000 CPI members, took part in the proceedings. The convention decided to convene the 7th Party Congress of CPI in &lt;a href=\"Calcutta\"&gt;Calcutta&lt;/a&gt; later the same year.\nMarking a difference from the official sector of CPI, the Tenali convention was marked by the display of a large portrait of the Chinese Communist leader &lt;a href=\"Mao%20Zedong\"&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the Tenali convention a Bengal-based pro-Chinese group, representing one of the most radical streams of the CPI left-wing, presented a draft program proposal of their own. These radicals criticized the draft program proposal prepared by &lt;a href=\"M.%20Basavapunniah\"&gt;M. Basavapunniah&lt;/a&gt; for undermining &lt;a href=\"class%20struggle\"&gt;class struggle&lt;/a&gt; and failing to take a clear pro-Chinese position in the ideological conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Communist Party of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; (CPSU) and the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Chinese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; (CCP).\nAfter the Tenali convention, the CPI left-wing organized party district and state conferences. In &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;, a few of these meetings became battlegrounds between the most radical elements and the more moderate leadership. At the Calcutta Party District Conference, an alternative draft program was presented to the leadership by Parimal Das Gupta (a leading figure amongst far-left intellectuals in the party). Another alternative proposal was brought forward to the Calcutta Party District Conference by &lt;a href=\"Aziz%20ul%20Haq\"&gt;Aziz ul Haq&lt;/a&gt;, but Haq was initially banned from presenting it by the conference organizers. At the Calcutta Party District Conference, 42 delegates opposed M. Basavapunniah's official draft program proposal.\nAt the Siliguri Party District Conference, the main draft proposal for a party program was accepted, but with some additional points suggested by the far-left North Bengal cadre &lt;a href=\"Charu%20Majumdar\"&gt;Charu Majumdar&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Harekrishna%20Konar\"&gt;Harekrishna Konar&lt;/a&gt; (representing the leadership of the CPI left-wing) forbade the raising of the slogan \"Mao Tse-Tung Zindabad\" (Long live Mao Tse-Tung) at the conference.\nParimal Das Gupta's document was also presented to the leadership at the West Bengal State Conference of the CPI leftwing. Das Gupta and a few others spoke at the conference, demanding the party ought to adopt the class analysis of the Indian state of the 1951 CPI conference. His proposal was, however, voted down.\nThe Calcutta Congress was held between 31 October and 7 November, at Tyagraja Hall in southern &lt;a href=\"Calcutta\"&gt;Calcutta&lt;/a&gt;. Simultaneously, the CPI convened a Party Congress in &lt;a href=\"Bombay\"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt;. The group which assembled in Calcutta would later adopt the name 'Communist Party of India (Marxist)', to differentiate themselves from the CPI. The CPI(M) also adopted its own political program. &lt;a href=\"P.%20Sundarayya\"&gt;P. Sundarayya&lt;/a&gt; was elected general secretary of the party.\nIn total 422 delegates took part in the Calcutta Congress. CPI(M) claimed that they represented 104,421 CPI members, 60% of the total party membership.\nAt the Calcutta conference, the party adopted a class analysis of the character of the Indian state, that claimed the Indian &lt;a href=\"bourgeoisie\"&gt;bourgeoisie&lt;/a&gt; was increasingly collaborating with &lt;a href=\"imperialism\"&gt;imperialism&lt;/a&gt;.\nParimal Das Gupta's alternative draft program was not circulated at the Calcutta conference. However, &lt;a href=\"Souren%20Basu\"&gt;Souren Basu&lt;/a&gt;, a delegate from the far-left stronghold &lt;a href=\"Darjeeling\"&gt;Darjeeling&lt;/a&gt;, spoke at the conference asking why no portrait had been raised of Mao Tse-Tung along with the portraits of other communist stalwarts. His intervention was met with huge applause from conference delegates.\nEarly years of CPI(M) (1964\u20131966).\nThe CPI (M) was born into a hostile political climate. At the time of the holding of its Calcutta Congress, large sections of its leaders and cadres were jailed without trial. Again on 29\u201330 December, over a thousand CPI (M) cadres were arrested and detained and held in jail without trial. In 1965 new waves of arrests of CPI(M) cadres took place in &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;, as the party launched agitations against the rise in fares in the &lt;a href=\"Calcutta%20Tramways\"&gt;Calcutta Tramways&lt;/a&gt; and against the then-prevailing food crisis. Statewide general strikes and &lt;a href=\"hartal\"&gt;hartal&lt;/a&gt;s were observed on 5 August 1965, 10\u201311 March 1966, and 6 April 1966. The March 1966 general strike resulted in several deaths during confrontations with police forces.\nAlso in Kerala, mass arrests of CPI(M) cadres were carried out during 1965. In &lt;a href=\"Bihar\"&gt;Bihar&lt;/a&gt;, the party called for a \"&lt;a href=\"hartal\"&gt;Bandh&lt;/a&gt;\" (general strike) in &lt;a href=\"Patna\"&gt;Patna&lt;/a&gt; on 9 August 1965 in protest against the Congress state government. During the strike, police resorted to violent actions against the organizers of the strike. The strike was followed by agitations in other parts of the state.\nP. Sundaraiah, after being released from jail, spent the period of September 1965 \u2013 February 1966 in Moscow for medical treatment. In Moscow, he also held talks with the CPSU.\nThe Central Committee of CPI(M) held its first meeting on 12\u201319 June 1966. The reason for delaying the holding of a regular CC meeting was the fact that several of the persons elected as CC members at the Calcutta Congress were jailed at the time. A CC meeting had been scheduled to have been held in &lt;a href=\"Trichur\"&gt;Trichur&lt;/a&gt; during the last days of 1964, but had been canceled due to the wave of arrests against the party. The meeting discussed tactics for electoral alliances and concluded that the party should seek to form a broad electoral alliance with all non-reactionary opposition parties in West Bengal (i.e. all parties except Jan Sangh and Swatantra Party). This decision was strongly criticized by the Communist Party of China, the &lt;a href=\"Party%20of%20Labour%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Party of Labour of Albania&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Communist Party of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, and the radicals within the party itself. The line was changed at a National Council meeting in &lt;a href=\"Jullunder\"&gt;Jullunder&lt;/a&gt; in October 1966, where it was decided that the party should only form alliances with select left parties.\nNaxalbari uprising (1967).\nAt this point, the party stood at crossroads. There were radical sections of the party who were wary of the increasing parliamentary focus of the party leadership, especially after the electoral victories in West Bengal and Kerala. Developments in China also affected the situation inside the party. In West Bengal, two separate internal dissident tendencies emerged, which both could be identified as supporting the Chinese line.\nIn 1967 a peasant uprising broke out in &lt;a href=\"Naxalbari\"&gt;Naxalbari&lt;/a&gt;, in northern West Bengal. The insurgency was led by hardline district-level CPI(M) leaders &lt;a href=\"Charu%20Majumdar\"&gt;Charu Majumdar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kanu%20Sanyal\"&gt;Kanu Sanyal&lt;/a&gt;. The hardliners within CPI(M) saw the Naxalbari uprising as the spark that would ignite the Indian revolution. The Communist Party of China hailed the Naxalbari movement, causing an abrupt break in CPI(M)-CPC relations.\nThe Naxalbari movement was violently repressed by the West Bengal government, of which CPI(M) was a major partner. Within the party, the hardliners rallied around an &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Coordination%20Committee%20of%20Communist%20Revolutionaries\"&gt;All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries&lt;/a&gt;. Following the 1968 &lt;a href=\"Burdwan\"&gt;Burdwan&lt;/a&gt; plenum of CPI(M) (held on 5\u201312 April 1968), the AICCCR separated themselves from CPI(M). This split divided the party throughout the country. But notably in West Bengal, which was the center of the violent radicalized stream, no prominent leading figure left the party. The party and the &lt;a href=\"Naxalite\"&gt;Naxalite&lt;/a&gt;s (as the rebels were called) were soon to get into a bloody feud.\nIn Andhra Pradesh, another revolt was taking place. There the pro-Naxalbari dissidents had not established any presence. But in the party organization, there were many veterans from the Telangana armed struggle, who rallied against the central party leadership. In Andhra Pradesh, the radicals had a strong base even amongst the state-level leadership. The main leader of the radical tendency was &lt;a href=\"T.%20Nagi%20Reddy\"&gt;T. Nagi Reddy&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the state legislative assembly. On 15 June 1968, the leaders of the radical tendency published a press statement outlining the critique of the development of CPI(M). It was signed by T. Nagi Reddy, D.V. Rao, Kolla Venkaiah, and &lt;a href=\"Chandra%20Pulla%20Reddy\"&gt;Chandra Pulla Reddy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn total around 50% of the party cadres in Andhra Pradesh left the party to form the &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Pradesh%20Coordination%20Committee%20of%20Communist%20Revolutionaries\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries&lt;/a&gt;, under the leadership of T. Nagi Reddy.\nDismissal of United Front governments in West Bengal and Kerala (1967\u20131970).\nIn November 1967, the West Bengal United Front government was dismissed by the central government. Initially, the Indian National Congress formed a minority government led by &lt;a href=\"Prafulla%20Chandra%20Ghosh\"&gt;Prafulla Chandra Ghosh&lt;/a&gt;, but that cabinet did not last long. Following the proclamation that the United Front government had been dislodged, a 48-hour hartal was effective throughout the state. After the fall of the Ghosh cabinet, the state was put under President's Rule. CPI(M) launched agitations against the interventions of the central government in West Bengal. \nThe 8th Party Congress of CPI(M) was held in &lt;a href=\"Cochin\"&gt;Cochin&lt;/a&gt;, Kerala, on 23\u201329 December 1968. On 25 December 1968, whilst the congress was held, 42 &lt;a href=\"Dalit\"&gt;Dalit&lt;/a&gt;s were &lt;a href=\"Kilvenmani%20massacre\"&gt;burned alive&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt; village of &lt;a href=\"Kizhavenmani\"&gt;Kizhavenmani&lt;/a&gt;. The massacre was a retaliation from landlords after Dalit labourers had taken part in a CPI(M)-led agitation for higher wages.\nThe United Front government in Kerala was forced out of office in October 1969, as the CPI, RSP, KTP, and Muslim League ministers resigned. E.M.S. Namboodiripad handed in his resignation on 24 October. A coalition government led by CPI leader &lt;a href=\"C.%20Achutha%20Menon\"&gt;C. Achutha Menon&lt;/a&gt; was formed, with the outside support of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt;.\nElections in West Bengal and Kerala.\nFresh elections were held in West Bengal in 1969. CPI(M) contested 97 seats and won 80. The party was now the largest in the West Bengal legislative. But with the active support of CPI and the &lt;a href=\"Bangla%20Congress\"&gt;Bangla Congress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ajoy%20Mukherjee\"&gt;Ajoy Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; was returned as Chief Minister of the state. Mukherjee resigned on 16 March 1970, after a pact had been reached between CPI, Bangla Congress, and the Indian National Congress against CPI(M). CPI(M) strove to form a new government, instead but the central government put the state under President's Rule.\nIn Kerala, fresh elections were held in 1970. CPI(M) contested 73 seats and won 29. After the election, Achutha Menon formed a new ministry, including ministers from the Indian National Congress. \nFormation of CITU (1970).\nCentre of Indian Trade Unions, CITU is a National level &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Union\"&gt;Trade Union&lt;/a&gt; in India and its trade union wing is a spearhead of the Indian Trade Union Movement. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions is today one of biggest assembly of workers and classes of India. It has strong unchallengeable presence in the &lt;a href=\"States%20and%20territories%20of%20India\"&gt;Indian state&lt;/a&gt; of Tripura besides a good presence in &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;, Kerala and &lt;a href=\"Kanpur\"&gt;Kanpur&lt;/a&gt;. They have an average presence in &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Pradesh\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;.\n According to the provisional statistics from the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Labour%20and%20Employment%20%28India%29\"&gt;Ministry of Labour&lt;/a&gt;, CITU had a membership of approximately 6,040,000 in 2015.\n&lt;a href=\"Tapan%20Kumar%20Sen\"&gt;Tapan Kumar Sen&lt;/a&gt; is the General Secretary and &lt;a href=\"K.%20Hemalata\"&gt;K. Hemalata&lt;/a&gt; is the president of CITU. K. Hemalata was the first woman President in CITU who was elected after &lt;a href=\"A.%20K.%20Padmanabhan\"&gt;A. K. Padmanabhan&lt;/a&gt;. It runs a monthly organ named \"WORKING CLASS\".\nCITU is affiliated to the &lt;a href=\"World%20Federation%20of%20Trade%20Unions\"&gt;World Federation of Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutbreak of war in East Pakistan (1971\u20131972).\nIn 1971 &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; (formerly &lt;a href=\"East%20Pakistan\"&gt;East Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;) declared its independence from &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. The Pakistani military tried to quell the uprising. India intervened militarily and gave active backing to the &lt;a href=\"Mukti%20Bahini\"&gt;Bangladeshi rebels&lt;/a&gt;. Millions of Bangladeshi refugees sought shelter in India, especially in West Bengal. \nAt the time the radical sections of the Bangladeshi communist movement were divided into many &lt;a href=\"Political%20factions\"&gt;factions&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst the pro-Soviet &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Bangladesh\"&gt;Communist Party of Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; actively participated in the rebellion, the pro-China communist tendency found itself in a peculiar situation as China had sided with Pakistan in the war. In Calcutta, where many Bangladeshi leftists had sought refuge, CPI(M) worked to co-ordinate the efforts to create a new political organization. In the fall of 1971 three small groups, which were all hosted by the CPI(M), came together to form the &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Communist%20Party%20%28Leninist%29\"&gt;Bangladesh Communist Party (Leninist)&lt;/a&gt;. The new party became the sister party of CPI(M) in Bangladesh.\nBoycott of Assembly and Emergency rule (1972\u20131977).\nIn 1975, the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20India\"&gt;Prime Minister of India&lt;/a&gt;, Indira Gandhi imposed a &lt;a href=\"national%20emergency\"&gt;national emergency&lt;/a&gt; on the premise of internal disturbances suspending elections, legitimising &lt;a href=\"rule%20by%20decree\"&gt;rule by decree&lt;/a&gt; and curbing &lt;a href=\"civil%20liberties\"&gt;civil liberties&lt;/a&gt;. The proposition for the declaration of the emergency and the formal draft of the ordinance were both notably corroborated to have been forwarded by &lt;a href=\"Siddhartha%20Shankar%20Ray\"&gt;Siddhartha Shankar Ray&lt;/a&gt;. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) emerged as one of the primary opposition to &lt;a href=\"the%20emergency%20rule%20of%20Indira%20Gandhi\"&gt;the emergency rule of Indira Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;. The following period witnessed a succession of &lt;a href=\"authoritarian\"&gt;authoritarian&lt;/a&gt; measures and political repression, which was particularly severe in West Bengal. The members of the CPI-M's labour union became the first subject to political repression and &lt;a href=\"mass%20arrest\"&gt;mass arrest&lt;/a&gt;s while the rest of the members of the CPI-M went underground.\nWith the initiation of the &lt;a href=\"Jayaprakash%20Narayan\"&gt;Jayaprakash Narayan&lt;/a&gt; (JP)'s movement, the CPI-M began providing support to it and went on to participate in discussions for the creation of a united front under the umbrella of the &lt;a href=\"Janata%20Party\"&gt;Janata Party&lt;/a&gt;. Several of the leaders of the CPI-M were also influenced by JP with &lt;a href=\"Jyoti%20Basu\"&gt;Jyoti Basu&lt;/a&gt; noted to be one of his prominent admirers having worked under him in the &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Railwaymen%27s%20Federation\"&gt;All India Railwaymen's Federation&lt;/a&gt; during the 1940s. The involvement of the &lt;a href=\"Hindutva\"&gt;Hindutva&lt;/a&gt; movement however complicated matters, according to JP the formal inclusion of the marxists who had underwent a splintering and whose organisation was localised in particular region would have been detrimental to the movement as the &lt;a href=\"Rashtriya%20Swayamsevak%20Sangh\"&gt;Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh&lt;/a&gt; members would switch sides if they joined. JP and Basu eventually came to an agreement that the CPI-M would not formally join the Janata Party as it would weaken the movement. After the revocation of the emergency, the CPI-M joined an electoral alliance with the Janata Party in the &lt;a href=\"1977%20Indian%20general%20election\"&gt;1977 Indian general election&lt;/a&gt; which resulted in an overwhelming victory for the Janata Alliance.\nLeft Front Government formation in West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura assembly (1977 afterwards).\nWest Bengal.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"1977%20West%20Bengal%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;1977 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election&lt;/a&gt;, negotiations between the &lt;a href=\"Janata%20Party\"&gt;Janata Party&lt;/a&gt; and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) broke down. This led to a three sided contested between the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt;, the Janata Party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) led &lt;a href=\"Left%20Front%20%28West%20Bengal%29\"&gt;Left Front coalition&lt;/a&gt;. The results of the election was a surprising sweep for the Left Front winning 230 seats out of 290 with the CPI-M winning an absolute majority on its own, Basu became the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Minister%20of%20West%20Bengal\"&gt;Chief Minister of West Bengal&lt;/a&gt; for the next 23 years until his retirement in 2000. Basu was also repeatedly elected as the representative of the &lt;a href=\"Satgachhia%20constituency\"&gt;Satgachhia constituency&lt;/a&gt; from 1977 to 2001.\nFrom 2000 to 2011, the CPI(M) was led by &lt;a href=\"Buddhadeb%20Bhattacharjee\"&gt;Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee&lt;/a&gt; who remained the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Minister%20of%20West%20Bengal\"&gt;Chief Minister of West Bengal&lt;/a&gt; for 11 years.\nKerala.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, two main pre-poll political alliances were formed: the &lt;a href=\"Left%20Democratic%20Front%20%28Kerala%29\"&gt;Left Democratic Front (LDF)&lt;/a&gt;, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Communist Party of India and the United Democratic Front (UDF), led by the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt;. These pre-poll political alliances of Kerala have stabilized strongly in such a manner that, with rare exceptions, most of the coalition partners stick their loyalty to the respective alliances (Left Democratic Front or United Democratic Front).\nLDF first came into power in &lt;a href=\"Kerala%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Kerala Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in 1980 under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"E.%20K.%20Nayanar\"&gt;E. K. Nayanar&lt;/a&gt; who later became the longest serving &lt;a href=\"Chief%20minister%20of%20Kerala\"&gt;Chief minister of Kerala&lt;/a&gt;, ever since &lt;a href=\"1980%20Kerala%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;1980 election&lt;/a&gt;, the power has been clearly alternating between the two alliances till the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Kerala%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;. In 2016, LDF won the 2016 election and had a historic re-election in &lt;a href=\"2021%20Kerala%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;2021 election&lt;/a&gt; where an incumbent government was re-elected for first time in 40 years. &lt;a href=\"Pinarayi%20Vijayan\"&gt;Pinarayi Vijayan&lt;/a&gt; is the first chief minister of Kerala to be re-elected after completing a full term (five years) in office.\nTripura.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Left%20Front%20%28Tripura%29\"&gt;Left Front&lt;/a&gt; governed Tripura 1978\u20131988, and again from 1993 to 2018. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) is the dominant party in the coalition. The other three members of the Left Front are the Communist Party of India, the &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Socialist%20Party%20%28India%29\"&gt;Revolutionary Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Forward%20Bloc\"&gt;All India Forward Bloc&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeadership and organisation.\nCPI(M) currently has three MPs in Lok Sabha. CPI(M)'s highest tally was in 2004 when it got 5.66% of votes polled in and it had 43 MPs. It won 42.31% on an average in the 69 seats it contested. It supported the new &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href=\"United%20Progressive%20Alliance\"&gt;United Progressive Alliance&lt;/a&gt; government, but without becoming a part of it. On 9 July 2008 it formally withdrew support from the UPA government explaining this by differences about the Indo-US nuclear deal and the IAEA Safeguards Agreement in particular.\nIn West Bengal and Tripura it participates in the &lt;a href=\"Left%20Front%20%28Tripura%29\"&gt;Left Front&lt;/a&gt;. In Kerala the party is part of the &lt;a href=\"Left%20Democratic%20Front%20%28Kerala%29\"&gt;Left Democratic Front&lt;/a&gt;. In Tamil Nadu, it is part of the &lt;a href=\"Secular%20Progressive%20Alliance\"&gt;Secular Progressive Alliance&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"Dravida%20Munnetra%20Kazhagam\"&gt;Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam&lt;/a&gt; (DMK).\nIts members in Great Britain are in the electoral front &lt;a href=\"Unity%20for%20Peace%20and%20Socialism\"&gt;Unity for Peace and Socialism&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Communist Party of Britain&lt;/a&gt; and the British domiciled sections of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Bangladesh\"&gt;Communist Party of Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Communist Party of Greece&lt;/a&gt; (KKE). It is standing 13 candidates in the London-wide list section of the &lt;a href=\"London%20Assembly\"&gt;London Assembly&lt;/a&gt; elections in May 2008.\nLeadership.\nThe current general secretary of CPI(M) is &lt;a href=\"Sitaram%20Yechury\"&gt;Sitaram Yechury&lt;/a&gt;. The 22nd party congress of CPI(M), held in &lt;a href=\"Hyderabad\"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; 18 April 2018 elected a Central Committee with 95 members including 2 permanent invitees, 6 invitees and a five-member Central Control Commission. The Central Committee later elected a 17-member &lt;a href=\"Politburo\"&gt;Politburo&lt;/a&gt;:\nPolitburo members.\nThe 22nd party congress newly inducts Tapan Sen and Nilotpal Basu into the &lt;a href=\"Politburo%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%29\"&gt;Politburo&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral Secretary.\nArticle XV, Section 15 of the party constitution says:\n\"No person can hold the position of the General Secretary for more than three full terms. Full term means the period between two Party Congresses. In a special situation, a person who has completed three full terms as General Secretary may be re-elected for a fourth term provided it is so decided by the Central Committee with a three-fourth majority. But in no case can that person be elected again for another term in addition to the fourth term.\"\nPrincipal mass organisations.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Tripura\"&gt;Tripura&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ganamukti%20Parishad\"&gt;Ganamukti Parishad&lt;/a&gt; is a major mass organisation amongst the &lt;a href=\"Tripuri%20people\"&gt;Tripuri&lt;/a&gt; peoples of the state. In Kerala, the &lt;a href=\"Adivasi%20Kshema%20Samithi\"&gt;Adivasi Kshema Samithi&lt;/a&gt;, a tribal organization, is controlled by CPI(M).\nPresence in states.\n the CPI(M) heads the state government in &lt;a href=\"Kerala\"&gt;Kerala&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pinarayi%20Vijayan\"&gt;Pinarayi Vijayan&lt;/a&gt; is Chief Minister of Kerala. In &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20Nadu%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; it has 2 MLAs and in the Government with &lt;a href=\"Secular%20Progressive%20Alliance\"&gt;SPA&lt;/a&gt; coalition led by &lt;a href=\"M.%20K.%20Stalin\"&gt;M. K. Stalin&lt;/a&gt;. The Left Front under CPI(M) governed &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt; for uninterrupted 34 years (1977\u20132011) and &lt;a href=\"Tripura\"&gt;Tripura&lt;/a&gt; for 30 years including uninterrupted 25 years (1993\u20132018). The 34 years of &lt;a href=\"Left%20Front%20%28West%20Bengal%29\"&gt;Left Front&lt;/a&gt; rule in West Bengal is the longest serving democratically elected communist-led government in the world.\nIndian general elections results.\n1967 general election.\nIn the 1967 &lt;a href=\"Lok%20Sabha\"&gt;Lok Sabha&lt;/a&gt; elections, the CPI(M) nominated 59 candidates. In total 19 of them were elected. The party received 6.2 million votes (4.28% of the nationwide vote). By comparison, CPI won 23 seats and got 5.11% of the nationwide vote. In the state legislative elections held simultaneously, the CPI(M) emerged as a major party in Kerala and West Bengal. In Kerala, a United Front government led by E.M.S. Namboodiripad was formed. In West Bengal, the CPI(M) was the main force behind the &lt;a href=\"United%20Front%20%281967%29\"&gt;United Front&lt;/a&gt; government formed. The Chief Ministership was given to &lt;a href=\"Ajoy%20Mukherjee\"&gt;Ajoy Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bangla%20Congress\"&gt;Bangla Congress&lt;/a&gt; (a regional splinter group of the Indian National Congress).\n1971 general election.\nWith the backdrop of the Bangladesh War and the emerging role of &lt;a href=\"Indira%20Gandhi\"&gt;Indira Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; as a populist national leader, the 1971 election to the Lok Sabha was held. The CPI(M) contested 85 seats and won in 25. In total the party mustered 7510089 votes (5.12% of the national vote). 20 of the seats came from West Bengal (including &lt;a href=\"Somnath%20Chatterjee\"&gt;Somnath Chatterjee&lt;/a&gt;, elected from Burdwan), 2 from Kerala (including A.K. Gopalan, elected from Palakkad), 2 from Tripura (Biren Dutta and &lt;a href=\"Dasarath%20Deb\"&gt;Dasarath Deb&lt;/a&gt;) and 1 from Andhra Pradesh.\nIn the same year, state legislative elections were held in three states; West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and &lt;a href=\"Odisha\"&gt;Odisha&lt;/a&gt;. In West Bengal CPI(M) had 241 candidates, winning 113 seats. In total the party mustered 4241557 votes (32.86% of the statewide vote). In Tamil Nadu CPI(M) contested 37 seats, but drew blank. The party got 259298 votes (1.65% of the statewide vote). In Odisha, the party contested 11 seats and won in two. The CPI(M) vote in the state was 52785 (1.2% of the statewide vote).\n1977 general elections.\nIn the 1977 Lok Sabha elections, the CPI(M) had fielded its candidates on 53 seats scattered around in 14 states and union territories of India. It won 4.29% of the average votes polled in this election. The party had won 17 seats from West Bengal, 3 from Maharashtra, and one each from Odisha and Punjab. This election was done shortly after the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi and reflected a wide uproar of masses against her draconian rule. A coalition of Opposition parties was formed against the Congress regime, CPI(M) too supported this coalition by not fielding its candidates against the Janta Party.\n1980 general elections.\nJanta Party coalition did not last much and two years after its formation India had faced the 1980s Lok Sabha Elections. This election saw an increase in the vote percentage of CPI(M) and the party secured more seats than the previous elections. The Party had contested elections in the 15 states and union territories of India and fielded its candidates on 64 seats. The party had won 37 seats in total. It won 28 seats in West Bengal, 7 in Kerala, and 2 seats in Tripura. The party emerged out as the whole sole representative of the people of Tripura in this election.\n2002 presidential elections.\nIn the 2002 Presidential elections, Left Front announced &lt;a href=\"Lakshmi%20Sehgal\"&gt;Captain Lakshmi Sehgal&lt;/a&gt; as its presidential candidate. Against her was the ruling &lt;a href=\"Bharatiya%20Janata%20Party\"&gt;Bharatiya Janata Party&lt;/a&gt;'s candidate &lt;a href=\"A.%20P.%20J.%20Abdul%20Kalam\"&gt;A. P. J. Abdul Kalam&lt;/a&gt;. CPI(M)'s Leadership has announced that in form of Captain Lakshmi, they are fielding an 'Alternative Candidate'. They said that though it is clear that Captain Lakshmi can't be the President of India because of the opposition of BJP led NDA and &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt; to her, but through this Presidential Election Left wants to raise key national issues, and make them heard to the masses. Captain Lakshmi herself had pointed out that this Presidential election reflects the opposition of the Indian Left to the Communal-Secreterian Politics of BJP and solidarity with the religious minorities who have suffered greatly under the &lt;a href=\"National%20Democratic%20Alliance%20%28India%29\"&gt;National Democratic Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership.\n2012 Vice-presidential election.\nWhile CPI(M) supported &lt;a href=\"Pranab%20Mukherjee\"&gt;Pranab Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; as presidential candidate in &lt;a href=\"2012%20Indian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2012 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, it was in favour of a non-Congress candidate for the post of the &lt;a href=\"Vice-President%20of%20India\"&gt;Vice-President&lt;/a&gt;.\n2014 Lok Sabha election.\nNine CPI(M) candidates were elected in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Indian%20general%20election\"&gt;2014 Indian general election&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two CPI(M)-supported independents. This is further down from the previous number of 16. The national vote share of CPI(M) has also shrunk from 5.33% in 2009 to mere 3.28% in 2014. This is a significant 38.5% reduction within a span of 5 years which is consistent with the overall decline of the left in India. CPI(M) did not win a single seat in Tamil Nadu and its seats went down from 9 to 2 in West Bengal where it is being heavily eroded by &lt;a href=\"Mamata%20Banerjee\"&gt;Mamata Banerjee&lt;/a&gt; governed &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Trinamool%20Congress\"&gt;AITC&lt;/a&gt;. Kerala is the only state where CPI(M) gained one more seat but this is mainly attributed to the splitting of anti-LDF votes between the UDF and emerging NDA. The NDA saw a sharp spike in vote share in decades which came coupled with a sharp decline in UDF votes. Thus, it is assumed that the NDA cut into UDF votes thereby facilitating victory for LDF. This was again mirrored during the 2016 Kerala Legislative Assembly election, which saw the NDA getting entry into the State Assembly for the first time as BJP veteran &lt;a href=\"O.%20Rajagopal\"&gt;O. Rajagopal&lt;/a&gt; wins the Nemom seat and CPI(M)'s &lt;a href=\"Pinarayi%20Vijayan\"&gt;Pinarayi Vijayan&lt;/a&gt; forming the LDF-ruled government.\n2019 general election.\nThe CPI(M) contested 65 seats nationwide and won three in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Indian%20general%20election\"&gt;2019 general election&lt;/a&gt;. One seat was won in Kerala, where the CPI(M) is leading the state government. Two other seats were won in Tamil Nadu, where the CPI(M) contested within the DMK-led coalition.\nSplits and offshoots.\nA large number of parties have been formed as a result of splits from the CPI(M), such as"
