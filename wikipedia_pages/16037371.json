    "text": "Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911\u201345 is a work of history written by &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20W.%20Tuchman\"&gt;Barbara W. Tuchman&lt;/a&gt; and published in 1971 by &lt;a href=\"Macmillan%20Publishers\"&gt;Macmillan Publishers&lt;/a&gt;. It won the 1972 &lt;a href=\"Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20General%20Non-Fiction\"&gt;Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction&lt;/a&gt;. The book was republished in 2001 by &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Press\"&gt;Grove Press&lt;/a&gt; It was also published under the title \"Sand Against the Wind: Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911\u201345\" by &lt;a href=\"Macmillan%20Publishers\"&gt;Macmillan Publishers&lt;/a&gt; in 1970.\nUsing the life of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stilwell\"&gt;Joseph Stilwell&lt;/a&gt;, the military attache to China from 1935 to 1939 and commander of United States forces and allied chief of staff to &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-shek&lt;/a&gt; from 1942 to 1944, this book explores the history of China from the &lt;a href=\"Xinhai%20Revolution\"&gt;Revolution of 1911&lt;/a&gt; to the turmoil of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, when China's Nationalist government faced attack from both &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese invaders and &lt;a href=\"Communist\"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"insurgency\"&gt;insurgents&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nPrologue: The Crisis\nDuring the Second World War, the United States Government requested that &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stilwell\"&gt;Lieutenant General Joseph W. Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; be placed in command of China\u2019s armed forces. Tuchman notes that an American's overseeing an ally\u2019s forces was an \u201cunprecedented\u201d arrangement. &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;General Chiang Kai Shek&lt;/a&gt;, who was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; at the time, expressed his frustration at the request as it was not palatable to have a foreigner in command of his forces. The Chinese were said to be in a \u201cdesperate\u201d situation in their struggles against the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Army\"&gt;Japanese Forces&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;President Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;, in his message to Chiang, said that he knew of \u201cno other man who has the ability, the force and the determination to offset the disaster that now threatens China.\u201d Chiang ultimately accepted the request with the remark, according to &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20J.%20Hurley\"&gt;General Patrick Hurley&lt;/a&gt;, that Stilwell had more power in China than he had. Tuchman narrates that the American\u2019s initiative to aid the Chinese sought to prevent the Japanese from \u201cravaging\u201d China and the nearby countries, hoping to maintain a foundation of stability in Asia.\nFoundations of an Officer\nJoseph Warren Stilwell, son of Benjamin Stilwell and descendant of Nicholas Stilwell, was a model student and athlete at the &lt;a href=\"Yonkers%20Middle%20High%20School\"&gt;public high school of Yonkers&lt;/a&gt; who was set for postgraduate study at Yale. However, during the senior dance in his final year, Stilwell assaulted the refreshment table volunteer with tubs of ice cream and trays of cake, which would later be known as the \u201cGreat Ice Cream Raid\u201d. Stilwell was then punished and not allowed to graduate. This led to discipline from his father which would eventually divert Warren Stilwell to enter the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;West Point Military Academy&lt;/a&gt; and begin his military career. Stilwell would eventually meet his wife, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.geni.com/people/Winifred-Stilwell/6000000015615548005\"&gt;Winifred A. Smith&lt;/a&gt;, during a campaign in Mexico 1908. The chapter ends with Stilwell\u2019s departure for China following the unfolding events of its &lt;a href=\"1911%20Revolution\"&gt;Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in the news.\nVisitor To Revolution: China\nThis segment of the book begins with Stilwell\u2019s arrival in China and his evaluation of China as a spiritual country. Stilwell remarks that China believes itself to be the center of civilization, warding off any evil spirits and barbarians that live beyond its border through \u201c&lt;a href=\"Feng%20shui\"&gt;Feng Shui&lt;/a&gt;\u201d. Tuchman provides an account of China\u2019s political history, introducing the &lt;a href=\"First%20Opium%20War\"&gt;First Opium War&lt;/a&gt; that led to the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Nanking\"&gt;Treaty of Nanjing&lt;/a&gt;, opening up China to foreign countries. Efforts of revolution then began to surface in 1911 as an attempt by several Chinese parties to restore China\u2019s independence and equality among the nations. The section ends with Stilwell leaving China wi\nth the &lt;a href=\"1911%20Revolution\"&gt;Revolution&lt;/a&gt; still in its early stages.\nThe Great War: Saint Mihiel and Shantung\nWarren Stilwell was not content with his contribution to the Army during his early years of service, consisting mainly of serving in the Department of History and Modern Languages, where he taught Spanish. Tuchman narrates that Stilwell escaped the \u201cfate\u201d of remaining a language instructor when his proficiency in Spanish promoted him to a temporary rank of \u201c&lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;\u201d as &lt;a href=\"Military%20Attach%C3%A9\"&gt;Military Attach\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; in Spain, 1917. Four months later, Stilwell was appointed to France not as front line but as staff reporting to Commanding General AEF for Intelligence duty. During his post there, France aided &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;the Allied&lt;/a&gt; aggression on the German defense in &lt;a href=\"Saint-Mihiel\"&gt;Saint-Mihiel&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Pershing\"&gt;John J. Pershing&lt;/a&gt; which eventually broke through. The fall of Saint-Mihiel and subsequent events led to the defeat of Germany which ended the First World War and led to the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt; in 1919. Following the treaty briefly was Japan\u2019s efforts to continue holding strategical territory over China, seizing &lt;a href=\"Shandong\"&gt;Shantung&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Woodrow%20Wilson\"&gt;President Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt; conceded over Japanese pressure and confirmed Japan as successor to all German concessions in Shantung. The bulk of the remainder of the section focuses on following the student rebellion against Japanese Occupation in Shantung and the rest of China.\nAssignment to Peking: Years of the Warlords\nStilwell was appointed as first language officer for China to represent the Army in 1919 where he would practice Chinese. Tuchman then informs of the complexity of the Chinese (&lt;a href=\"Mandarin%20Chinese\"&gt;Mandarin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cantonese\"&gt;Cantonese&lt;/a&gt;) Language, as well as the various difficulties Stilwell encountered during his time leaning Chinese. The rest of the section is devoted to Stilwell\u2019s journey through &lt;a href=\"Shanxi\"&gt;Shanxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shaanxi\"&gt;Shensi&lt;/a&gt;, visiting rural villages and the walled lotus courts in Peking China, communicating with both the lower and upper echelons of the Chinese society.\nThe \u201cCan Do\u201d Regiment and the Rise of Chiang Kai-Shek\n&lt;a href=\"Kuomintang\"&gt;The Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt;, at this time infused with new strength by its alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20International\"&gt;Communist International&lt;/a&gt;, received aid from the Russians in the form of two advisors, &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Borodin\"&gt;Mikhail Borodin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vasily%20Blyukher\"&gt;Vasily Blyukher&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yat-sen\"&gt;Sun Yat-Sen&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Kuomintang, was convinced by the two advisors that the success of the Kuomintang party was not to be accomplished by relying on opportunistic alliances without a common goal, but first by an indoctrinated force of its own. Sun, heeding their advice, sent a thirty-seven-year-old &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai-Shek&lt;/a&gt;, a disciple of Sun, on a military mission to Moscow, heading reciprocal indoctrination training. Soon after came Sun\u2019s death, and Chiang quickly surfaced as the Kuomintang\u2019s military chief. Chiang eventually rose to power after beginning his extermination campaign of the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Communist party&lt;/a&gt;, seizing control of the main government. However, Chiang Kai-shek still held sovereign executive power over members of the Executive Committee in the party, and the disbandment between generals of different military divisions caused factions to move with or against each other at different times. Chiang claimed to support democracy, but Tuchman points out that Stilwell remained skeptical of the progress of \u201cdemocracy\u201d made by the Kuomintang.\n\u201cVinegar Joe\u201d\n&lt;a href=\"Fort%20Benning\"&gt;Fort Benning&lt;/a&gt; was the Army's basic tactical school. &lt;a href=\"George%20C.%20Marshall\"&gt;George Catlett Marshall Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, assistant commander of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, was appalled by the casualties of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and believed they resulted largely from insufficient training. He needed leadership of short simple orders focused on objectives without unnecessary detail. Knowing that Stilwell fit the prescription, he swiftly appointed Stilwell head of the First or Tactical Section in Fort Benning, 1929. Stilwell\u2019s four-year tenure at Fort Benning earned high praises, with many describing him as \u201ca genius for instruction\u201d, \u201cfarsighted\u201d, \u201chighly intelligent\u201d, etc. His coldness and expression towards stupidity at one point earned him the nickname \u201cVinegar Joe\u201d. Tuchman then covers the sudden attack by the &lt;a href=\"Kwantung%20Army\"&gt;Japanese Kwantung Army&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"South%20Manchuria%20Railway\"&gt;South Manchuria Railway&lt;/a&gt; in 1931. Tuchman points out that Chiang Kai-Shek was unable to retaliate and was forced to make a strategic retreat. This was mainly due to military energies being spent on his extermination campaigns of the Communist Party. Tuchman suggests that Chiang held \u201cpacification\u201d before social, political reform, or invader resistance, and narrates that if there was one thing that could qualify Chiang for greatness, it was his \u201cgripping conviction\u201d to \u201cunite\u201d his country before everything else. However, she states that this \u201cconviction\u201d was just one of the several miscalculations that many historical figures like Chiang have made, as she suggests the internal warfare between multiple conflicting parties in China would be unreasonable for this \u201cconviction\u201d to stand. Tuchman suggests that this unreasonable \u201cconviction\u201d absorbed the Government\u2019s military power and would leave China unprepared for the Japanese attack.\nThemes.\nBarbara Tuchman states that the theme of the book revolves around the Sino-American relationship in the early nineteenth century. Tuchman asserts that the vehicle of the theme is the career of General Stilwell during his time in China. She says that Stilwell is an important key to the theme of the book as although he was knowledgeable, experienced, and persistent, Stilwell was still not the ideal man to solve the warfare in China.\nCharacters.\nGeneral &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stilwell\"&gt;Joseph Warren Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; is an American General who was requested on behalf of the United States Government to aid the Chinese in their battle against the Japanese from 1911 to 1945.\nGeneral &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Kai-shek\"&gt;Chiang Kai Shek&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the Republic of China, and commander of the National Revolutionary Army. General Stilwell aided him in his battle against the Chinese &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; and the Japanese in the early twentieth century.\n&lt;a href=\"Woodrow%20Wilson\"&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt; is the 28th President of the United States from 1913 to 1921. He was responsible for authorizing Japanese power over the German leased Shantung in China after the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.\n&lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Pershing\"&gt;John Joseph Pershing&lt;/a&gt; GCB, was a senior United States Army Officer. He held command over Joseph Warren Stilwell during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel.\n&lt;a href=\"George%20C.%20Marshall\"&gt;George Catlett Marshall Jr.&lt;/a&gt; GCB served as Chief of Staff under Roosevelt and Truman, and became Secretary of Defense under Truman. He was the assistant commander of the Infantry School at Fort Benning. He would appoint Joseph Stilwell as head of the First or Tactical Section in Fort Benning in 1929.\n&lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yat-sen\"&gt;Sun Yat-Sen&lt;/a&gt; was the first president of the Republic of China. He commanded over Chiang Kai Shek in during his reign as president.\n&lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Borodin\"&gt;Mikhail Borodin&lt;/a&gt; was a Russian Communist International Agent, and was military advisor to Sun Yat-Sen during the 1920s.\n&lt;a href=\"Vasily%20Blyukher\"&gt;Vasily Konstantinovich Blyukher&lt;/a&gt; was a Soviet Military Commander and military advisor to Sun Yat-Sen in China during the 1920s.\nReception.\nThe book received a mix of positive and negative reviews. Critics have commented on the scope the book brings to the Sino-American relations; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-asian-studies/article/harold-monk-vinacke-18931981/BDD6D2FDB7F7378286772A531AF05749\"&gt;Harold M Vinacke&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Affairs\"&gt;Pacific Affairs&lt;/a&gt; remarks that Tuchman\u2019s coverage on Stilwell\u2019s experience in China is the broadest, giving the reader a very \u201cperceptive summary\u201d of recent Chinese History. However, the broad coverage is unable to shed light on the \u201cKuomintang-Communist relations\u201d as the book was only able to \u201ctouch the fringes of Chinese Communism\u201d, as commented by Vinacke.\nThomas L. Kennedy of &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Historical%20Review\"&gt;The Pacific Historical Review&lt;/a&gt; remarks that the book is a \u201cgripping biography judiciously reinforced with analytical discussions\u201d. According to Kennedy, although Tuchman is sympathetic in her assessment of Stilwell, she is largely able to maintain an objective point of view. However, Kennedy proposes that Tuchman \u201csometimes fails to achieve a balanced perspective\u201d of the various military-diplomatic problems that Stilwell faces throughout his career, although \u201cdistortions\u201d of unbalanced perspectives are \u201cfortunately\u201d rarely found in the volume.\nCharles F. Romanus from &lt;a href=\"The%20Journal%20of%20Asian%20Studies\"&gt;The Journal of Asian Studies&lt;/a&gt; is critical of Tuchman\u2019s text style and her account of Stilwell and the military strategies deployed in the book. Romanus deems the subheadings of the book \u201camateurish, demeaning\u201d and \u201ccontroversial\u201d and they do not follow the guidelines of the army historian. Romanus advises the reader to be aware of Tuchman\u2019s various subjectiveness found throughout her novel to \u201csee if General Stilwell is thinking and speaking for himself or if Mrs. Tuchman is forcing her own assumptions of the situation.\u201d He also comments that the \u201creal basis of the book\u201d is not written from \u201cprimary official source materials\u201d and that people of oriental philosophy will disagree with Tuchman\u2019s foreign ideologies.\n&lt;a href=\"Kirkus%20Reviews\"&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/a&gt; said that the book leaned \u201ctoward biographical rather than political history\u201d, stating that Tuchman fails to analyze Stilwell\u2019s defeat when he does not address it in his diary. According to the review, Tuchman was not at \u201cher descriptive best\u201d during the peak of Stilwell\u2019s military career, but the \u201csurpassingly readable style and sensibility\u201d established in her earlier works sustain her writing.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; describes the book to be a valuable historical source that is \u201cintriguing\u201d but also \u201cdesperately sad\u201d as it is \u201calmost unremittingly about failure\u201d. The newspaper praises Tuchman, saying that the book is a \u201cfantastic and complex story finely told\u201d.\nFilm adaptations.\nDiscussion for a possible film adaptation of the book was announced by a meeting between &lt;a href=\"https%3A//cn.linkedin.com/in/jianjun-sun-67171811a\"&gt;Jianjun Sun&lt;/a&gt;, President of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.linkedin.com/company/pegasus-media\"&gt;Pegasus Media Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Shamberg\"&gt;Michael Shamberg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.imdb.com/name/nm0340112/bio\"&gt;Alan Greisman&lt;/a&gt; in December 2016. The film project is assumed to be supported by the $100 million development fund formed by the Pegasus Media Group and &lt;a href=\"China%20Film%20Group%20Corporation\"&gt;China Film Group&lt;/a&gt;. Greisman will be represented by &lt;a href=\"Paradigm%20Talent%20Agency\"&gt;Paradigm&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s , while Shamberg will be represented by &lt;a href=\"Creative%20Artists%20Agency\"&gt;CAA&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.linkedin.com/in/jonah-greenberg-90a30613\"&gt;Jonah Greenberg&lt;/a&gt;.\nAwards.\nThe book won the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 1972. It was also a finalist for the National Book Award for Biography in 1972."
