It is the second largest university in the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Metropolitan%20Area\"&gt;Detroit Metropolitan Area&lt;/a&gt; with 20,012 students and it is &lt;a href=\"Carnegie%20Classification%20of%20Institutions%20of%20Higher%20Education\"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; among \"R2: Doctoral Universities \u2013 High research activity.\" The university offers 132 bachelor's degree programs and 138 professional graduate certificate, master's degree, and doctoral degree programs, including those offered by the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20University%20William%20Beaumont%20School%20of%20Medicine\"&gt;Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.\nOakland University was created in 1957 when the heiress to the &lt;a href=\"Dodge\"&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt; automaker fortune, &lt;a href=\"Matilda%20Dodge%20Wilson\"&gt;Matilda Dodge Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and her second husband, lumber baron Alfred Wilson, donated their estate to &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20State%20University\"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt;, for the formation of Michigan State University-Oakland, later renamed Oakland University. The donation included two million dollars, their contiguous mansions &lt;a href=\"Meadow%20Brook%20Hall\"&gt;Meadow Brook Hall&lt;/a&gt; and Sunset Terrace, which now forms the Oakland University campus, and all associated collections of cultural artifacts. Covering and with 110 rooms, the Tudor-Revival style Meadow Brook Hall is the fourth largest historic mansion museum in the United States, a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt;, and is classified as one of America\u2019s Castles.\nThe university's athletic teams compete in &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;Division I&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; and are collectively known as the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Golden%20Grizzlies\"&gt;Golden Grizzlies&lt;/a&gt;. They are members of the &lt;a href=\"Horizon%20League\"&gt;Horizon League&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIn 1908, &lt;a href=\"John%20Francis%20Dodge\"&gt;John Francis Dodge&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href=\"Matilda%20Dodge%20Wilson\"&gt;Matilda&lt;/a&gt; purchased a farmhouse and of land known as Meadow Brook Farms, located in central Oakland County.\nIn 1920, Matilda inherited John's fortune upon his death, soon remarrying to a lumber baron, &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20G.%20Wilson\"&gt;Alfred G. Wilson&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1926 and 1929, the couple built &lt;a href=\"Meadow%20Brook%20Hall\"&gt;Meadow Brook Hall&lt;/a&gt; on the land.\nMichigan State University\u2013Oakland to Oakland University.\nOakland University was created in 1957 when Matilda Dodge Wilson and her second husband, Alfred Wilson, donated their estate to &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20State%20University\"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Meadow%20Brook%20Hall\"&gt;Meadow Brook Hall&lt;/a&gt;, Sunset Terrace and all the estate's other buildings and collections, along with $2 million. Main campus buildings were completed on Squirrel Road in Pontiac Township (now the city of Auburn Hills). Originally known as Michigan State University\u2013Oakland, the university enrolled its first students in 1959, was renamed Oakland University in 1963, and has been officially independent of Michigan State University since 1970.\nWilson demanded that &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Postmaster%20General\"&gt;U.S. Postmaster General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Summerfield\"&gt;Arthur Summerfield&lt;/a&gt; let the university use a &lt;a href=\"Rochester%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Rochester, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, mailing address (201 Meadow Brook Rd., &lt;a href=\"Rochester%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Rochester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; 48309), even though the main campus was in &lt;a href=\"Pontiac%20Township%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Pontiac Township&lt;/a&gt; (now the city of Auburn Hills). After Wilson reminded him that she had contributed to his administration, Summerfield granted her request.\nIn September 2009, tenured faculty members represented by the Oakland University chapter of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20of%20University%20Professors\"&gt;American Association of University Professors&lt;/a&gt; went on strike. Issues of contention included the university claiming ownership of professors' &lt;a href=\"copyright\"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt;s and patents, refusing to allow faculty input into matters of class size and curricula, reduction of &lt;a href=\"Health%20insurance\"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; and a three-year &lt;a href=\"salary\"&gt;salary&lt;/a&gt; freeze. The salary freeze was in contrast to university president Gary Russi, who had just received a $100,000 raise. The university's board of trustees maintained that the strike was illegal and filed a lawsuit against the Oakland AAUP. After a week's strike, the faculty and administration came to an agreement on a three-year contract, which was implemented.\n2012 presidential primaries.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202012\"&gt;2012 Republican presidential primaries&lt;/a&gt;, Oakland University hosted a &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20presidential%20debates%2C%202012%23November%209%2C%202011%20%E2%80%93%20Rochester%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;debate between Republican presidential candidates&lt;/a&gt; on 9 November 2011. &lt;a href=\"CNBC\"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; televised the debate nationally, and the &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Republican%20Party\"&gt;Michigan Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; co-sponsored the debate with CNBC. Eight candidates participated: &lt;a href=\"Michele%20Bachmann\"&gt;Michele Bachmann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herman%20Cain\"&gt;Herman Cain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newt%20Gingrich\"&gt;Newt Gingrich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Huntsman%20Jr.\"&gt;Jon Huntsman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Paul\"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Perry\"&gt;Rick Perry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mitt%20Romney\"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Santorum\"&gt;Rick Santorum&lt;/a&gt;.\nCampus expansion.\nIn 2013, the Oakland University Board of Trustees approved a $65 million investment in campus expansion and improvement projects.
