    "text": "&lt;a href=\"ACF%20Fiorentina\"&gt;Associazione Calcio Firenze Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt; is an Italian professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tuscany\"&gt;Tuscany&lt;/a&gt;. The club was formed on 29 August 1926 by a merger of &lt;a href=\"C.S.%20Firenze\"&gt;C.S. Firenze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"P.G.%20Libertas\"&gt;P.G. Libertas&lt;/a&gt; as Associazione Calcio Firenze, and played its first competitive match on 3 October against &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Pisa%201909\"&gt;Pisa&lt;/a&gt;. Renamed to Associazione Calcio Fiorentina in 1927, the club won their first piece of silverware, the &lt;a href=\"1939%E2%80%9340%20Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;1939\u201340 Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt;, in their first season following their promotion back to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; after a one-season stay in the &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;second tier&lt;/a&gt;. Their first \"&lt;a href=\"scudetto\"&gt;scudetto&lt;/a&gt;\" (league championship) was won in the &lt;a href=\"1955%E2%80%9356%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1955\u201356 season&lt;/a&gt;, losing only once in the 34-game season; this was followed by four consecutive second-place finishes. On an international level, following their league win, Fiorentina took part for the first time in a European competition, becoming also the first Italian club to play in a &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt; final (losing &lt;a href=\"1957%20European%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2\u20130&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20CF\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;). In 1961, Fiorentina became the first Italian club to win a European competition, winning the &lt;a href=\"1960%E2%80%9361%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; in a two-legged final against &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;.\nFiorentina's second league title win came in the &lt;a href=\"1968%E2%80%9369%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1968\u201369 season&lt;/a&gt;, with the winning team, guided by &lt;a href=\"Bruno%20Pesaola\"&gt;Bruno Pesaola&lt;/a&gt;, being dubbed as the \"Fiorentina Ye-Ye\" due to their youth. In the years to follow, Fiorentina's performances deteriorated (which included near-relegation finishes), although they did win the &lt;a href=\"1974%E2%80%9375%20Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;1974\u201375 Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1980s, the club almost collected their third Serie A title in the &lt;a href=\"1981%E2%80%9382%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1981\u201382 season&lt;/a&gt;, however they lost it to &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt; in the last game of the season. The decade ended with a runners-up finish in the &lt;a href=\"1989%E2%80%9390%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;1989\u201390 UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, losing to Juventus 3\u20131 on aggregate.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1992\u201393 season&lt;/a&gt;, after a 55-year spell in the top division, Fiorentina were relegated to Serie B, despite &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Batistuta\"&gt;Gabriel Batistuta&lt;/a&gt;'s 16 league goals. Batistuta spearheaded Fiorentina's return to Serie A the following season and his career with the Florence-based side saw him finish as the club's top scorer for nine consecutive seasons. In the post-promotion years, the club added two further &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;Coppa Italia&lt;/a&gt; titles (in the &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;1995\u201396&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;2000\u201301 seasons&lt;/a&gt;) and a &lt;a href=\"1996%20Supercoppa%20Italiana\"&gt;Supercoppa Italiana&lt;/a&gt; win in 1996 to their trophy haul. In the wake of the &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2001\u201302 season&lt;/a&gt;, the club entered administration after financial problems. Re-formed initially as Florentia Viola in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C2\"&gt;Serie C2&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth level in the Italian league football hierarchy, and then later as ACF Fiorentina, the club returned to the top-tier league in the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20Serie%20B\"&gt;2003\u201304 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe club has won Serie A twice, Serie B three times, the Coppa Italia six times, the Supercoppa Italiana once and the UEFA Cup Winner's Cup once. As of the end of the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20ACF%20Fiorentina%20season\"&gt;2019\u201320 season&lt;/a&gt;, Fiorentina has played eighty-three seasons in Serie A, seven in Serie B and one season in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20D\"&gt;Serie D&lt;/a&gt; (or equivalent). This list details the club's achievements in major competitions, and the top scorers for each season.
