    "text": "Aircraft engine controls provide a means for the pilot to control and monitor the operation of the aircraft's powerplant. This article describes controls used with a basic &lt;a href=\"internal-combustion%20engine\"&gt;internal-combustion engine&lt;/a&gt; driving a &lt;a href=\"Propeller%20%28aircraft%29\"&gt;propeller&lt;/a&gt;. Some optional or more advanced configurations are described at the end of the article. &lt;a href=\"jet%20engine\"&gt;Jet turbine engines&lt;/a&gt; use different operating principles and have their own sets of controls and sensors.\nFuel.\nIf the aircraft is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"fuel%20pump\"&gt;fuel pump&lt;/a&gt;:\nPropeller.\nIn an aircraft with a fixed-pitch propeller, there is no direct control over the propeller &lt;a href=\"rotational%20speed\"&gt;rotational speed&lt;/a&gt;, which depends on the &lt;a href=\"air%20speed\"&gt;air speed&lt;/a&gt; and loading. Therefore, the pilot has to pay attention to the RPM indicator and adjust throttle/power lever in order to maintain a desired constant speed of the propeller. For example, when the air speed reduces and the loading increases (e.g., in a climb), RPM will decrease and the pilot has to increase the throttle/power. When the air speed increases and the loading decreases (e.g., in a dive), the RPM will increase and the pilot has to decrease the throttle/power in order to prevent RPM from exceeding the operational limits and damaging the motor.\nIf the aircraft is equipped with adjustable-pitch or constant-speed propeller(s):\nCowl.\nIf the aircraft is equipped with adjustable Cowl Flaps:"
