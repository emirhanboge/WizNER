On his return to France, he again took up his post as Red Star manager.\nFor 10 seasons, he coached the French national military team, with whom he won the World Championships.\nIn 1997, he finished the season with Lens and saved it from relegation.\nHe assisted &lt;a href=\"Aim%C3%A9%20Jacquet\"&gt;Aim\u00e9 Jacquet&lt;/a&gt; in the French team's 1998 &lt;a href=\"Football%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1998%20Football%20World%20Cup\"&gt;victory&lt;/a&gt;. This paved the way for him to take over as the national coach, winning &lt;a href=\"2000%20UEFA%20European%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;Euro 2000&lt;/a&gt; in Netherlands and Belgium and &lt;a href=\"2001%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt; next year. However, after the team suffered a stunning first-round exit in the &lt;a href=\"2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2002 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, he was sacked by the &lt;a href=\"French%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;French Football Federation&lt;/a&gt;.\nUndeterred, the &lt;a href=\"Tunisian%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Tunisian Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; soon hired Lemerre to be the manager of &lt;a href=\"Tunisia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;their national side&lt;/a&gt;.

He was sacked in February 2008 following the team's exit from the &lt;a href=\"2008%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2008 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; in the quarter-finals.\nLemerre was named the new head coach of &lt;a href=\"Morocco%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Morocco national team&lt;/a&gt; in May 2008 and took charge on 1 July. He was fired on 9 July 2009, for disappointing results.\nOn 18 December 2009, he accepted a managing job at &lt;a href=\"Ankarag%C3%BCc%C3%BC\"&gt;Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc&lt;/a&gt; on a six-month deal that could be extended if both parties agreed. Former Turkey international &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Cmit%20%C3%96zat\"&gt;\u00dcmit \u00d6zat&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as his assistant coach. In May 2010, despite the fact that Lemerre had turned the team around and possibly saved them from relegation, the club decided not to extend Lemerre's contract and he was replaced by his assistant \u00dcmit \u00d6zat for the 2009\u201310 season.\nIn December 2013, Lemerre agreed a six-month deal to take a coaching job at Tunisian team &lt;a href=\"%C3%89toile%20du%20Sahel\"&gt;\u00c9toile du Sahel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn January 2016 he became new manager of &lt;a href=\"CS%20Sedan%20Ardennes\"&gt;CS Sedan Ardennes&lt;/a&gt;.\nHonours.\nAs manager.\nFrance\nTunisia\n\u00c9toile du Sahel\nOrders"
