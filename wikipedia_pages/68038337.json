    "text": "Sofpironium bromide (trade name Ecclock; development code BBI-4000) is a drug used to treat &lt;a href=\"hyperhidrosis\"&gt;hyperhidrosis&lt;/a&gt; (excessive sweating). It was approved in Japan in 2020 as a 5% gel for the treament of primary axillary hyperhidrosis (PAH).\nSofpironium bromide is an &lt;a href=\"anticholinergic\"&gt;anticholinergic&lt;/a&gt; agent that reduces sweating by inhibiting &lt;a href=\"Muscarinic%20acetylcholine%20receptor%20M3\"&gt;M3 muscarinic receptors&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"eccrine%20gland\"&gt;eccrine gland&lt;/a&gt;s. It is a &lt;a href=\"Retrometabolic%20drug%20design\"&gt;retrometabolically-designed&lt;/a&gt; drug (or \"soft drug\") based on &lt;a href=\"glycopyrronium%20bromide\"&gt;glycopyrronium bromide&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it has been designed to exert the desired effects at the site of administration, after which it is quickly converted into an inactive non-toxic &lt;a href=\"drug%20metabolism\"&gt;metabolite&lt;/a&gt; upon entering &lt;a href=\"systemic%20circulation\"&gt;systemic circulation&lt;/a&gt; avoiding the typical anticholinergic side-effects caused by off-site action."
