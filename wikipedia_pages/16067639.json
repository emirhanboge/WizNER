Favouring academics and athleticism, in 1979 Loxton High commenced its record breaking run at the annual &lt;a href=\"Riverland\"&gt;Riverland&lt;/a&gt; Interschool &lt;a href=\"Sport\"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt; Carnival, and to date has not been beaten for the championship shield since. The school underwent a major re-development between 2001-2007 with the completion of the new administration building, science laboratories, technology workshops and &lt;a href=\"gym\"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt;nasium.\nSport.\nThe school currently competes competitively in Athletics, Triathlon, Cross Country, Swimming, Pedal Prix and Volleyball. Loxton High is currently ranked as the top triathlon school in the state, the second best athletics school, and the third best volleyball school (2012)."
