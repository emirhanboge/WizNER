It was founded on July 17, 1952, and merged into CAAC on June 9, 1953. In 1988, the monopoly was broken up and CAAC Airlines was split into six regional airlines, which later consolidated into China's Big Three airlines: Beijing-based &lt;a href=\"Air%20China\"&gt;Air China&lt;/a&gt;, Guangzhou-based &lt;a href=\"China%20Southern%20Airlines\"&gt;China Southern Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, and Shanghai-based &lt;a href=\"China%20Eastern%20Airlines\"&gt;China Eastern Airlines&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1962, CAAC began operating international services, initially to other countries in the &lt;a href=\"communist%20bloc\"&gt;communist bloc&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mongolian%20People%27s%20Republic\"&gt;Mongolia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laos\"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burma%23Military%20rule\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Vietnam\"&gt;North Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cambodia%23Independence%20and%20Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;. By the mid-1980s, CAAC had long-haul service to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, mainly using American &lt;a href=\"Boeing\"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; aircraft, while continuing to use Soviet aircraft on routes to Eastern Europe.\nSeparation.\nIn 1988, CAAC Airlines split into six separate airlines, each named after the geographic region of their main operating areas:\nCAAC used the IATA code CA on international flights only; domestic flights were not prefixed with the airline code.\nCAAC's aircraft livery featured the Chinese national flag on the &lt;a href=\"vertical%20stabilizer\"&gt;vertical stabilizer&lt;/a&gt;, with blue stripes and Chinese version of CAAC logo (designed by Lu Shifang in 1965, with the calligraphy of Premier &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Enlai\"&gt;Zhou Enlai&lt;/a&gt;) on a white fuselage.\nFleet.\nCAAC Airlines consisted of the following aircraft:"
