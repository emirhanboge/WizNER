    "text": "Jean Parker (born Lois May Green; August 11, 1915 \u2013 November 30, 2005) was an American film and stage actress. A native of &lt;a href=\"Montana\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, her parents were &lt;a href=\"poverty\"&gt;indigent&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;, and she was adopted by a family in &lt;a href=\"Pasadena%2C%20California\"&gt;Pasadena, California&lt;/a&gt; at age 10. She initially aspired to be an illustrator and artist, but was discovered at age 17 by &lt;a href=\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\"&gt;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&lt;/a&gt; executive &lt;a href=\"Louis%20B.%20Mayer\"&gt;Louis B. Mayer&lt;/a&gt; after a photograph of her was published in a Los Angeles newspaper when she won a poster contest.\nShe made her feature film debut in the &lt;a href=\"Pre-Code%20Hollywood\"&gt;pre-code&lt;/a&gt; drama \"&lt;a href=\"Divorce%20in%20the%20Family\"&gt;Divorce in the Family&lt;/a&gt;\" (1932), before being loaned to &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Pictures\"&gt;Columbia Pictures&lt;/a&gt;, who cast her in &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Capra\"&gt;Frank Capra&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20for%20a%20Day\"&gt;Lady for a Day&lt;/a&gt;\" (1933). The same year, she starred as &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20March\"&gt;Elizabeth March&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"George%20Cukor\"&gt;George Cukor&lt;/a&gt;'s adaptation of \"&lt;a href=\"Little%20Women%20%281933%20film%29\"&gt;Little Women&lt;/a&gt;\" opposite &lt;a href=\"Katharine%20Hepburn\"&gt;Katharine Hepburn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Bennett\"&gt;Joan Bennett&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Frances%20Dee\"&gt;Frances Dee&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent roles included lead parts in the drama \"&lt;a href=\"Sequoia%20%281934%20film%29\"&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;\" (1934), and in the British comedy-fantasy \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ghost%20Goes%20West\"&gt;The Ghost Goes West&lt;/a&gt;\" (1935).\nParker later starred in the &lt;a href=\"Laurel%20and%20Hardy\"&gt;Laurel and Hardy&lt;/a&gt; comedy \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Flying%20Deuces\"&gt;The Flying Deuces&lt;/a&gt;\" (1939), followed by the sports film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pittsburgh%20Kid\"&gt;The Pittsburgh Kid&lt;/a&gt;\" (1941), and the &lt;a href=\"film%20noir\"&gt;film noir&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Eyes\"&gt;Dead Man's Eyes&lt;/a&gt;\" (1944), opposite &lt;a href=\"Lon%20Chaney%20Jr.\"&gt;Lon Chaney Jr.&lt;/a&gt; She made her &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20theatre\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; debut in 1946, in the title role of \"Loco\", followed by a leading role in the Broadway production of \"&lt;a href=\"Burlesque%20%28play%29\"&gt;Burlesque&lt;/a&gt;\" (1946\u20131947) opposite &lt;a href=\"Bert%20Lahr\"&gt;Bert Lahr&lt;/a&gt;. In 1948, she replaced &lt;a href=\"Judy%20Holliday\"&gt;Judy Holliday&lt;/a&gt; for the national Broadway touring production of &lt;a href=\"Garson%20Kanin\"&gt;Garson Kanin&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Born%20Yesterday%20%28play%29\"&gt;Born Yesterday&lt;/a&gt;\", which earned her favorable reviews. The next year, she appeared opposite &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20Peck\"&gt;Gregory Peck&lt;/a&gt; in a stage production of the comedy \"Light Up the Sky\".\nBy the 1950s, Parker's film career had slowed, though she continued to appear in a small number of films, including supporting parts in the Westerns \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gunfighter\"&gt;The Gunfighter&lt;/a&gt;\" (1950) and \"&lt;a href=\"Toughest%20Man%20in%20Arizona\"&gt;Toughest Man in Arizona&lt;/a&gt;\" (1952), and the film noir \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Tuesday%20%28film%29\"&gt;Black Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;\" (1954). She gave birth to her only child, son Robert Lowery Hanks Jr., in 1952, from her fourth marriage to actor &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Lowery%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Robert Lowery&lt;/a&gt;. Parker made her final film appearance in 1965's \"&lt;a href=\"Apache%20Uprising\"&gt;Apache Uprising&lt;/a&gt;\". She spent her later years in California, where she died of a &lt;a href=\"stroke\"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Motion%20Picture%20and%20Television%20Country%20House%20and%20Hospital\"&gt;Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles in 2005.\nBiography.\n1915\u20131932: Early life.\nParker was born on August 11, 1915 in &lt;a href=\"Deer%20Lodge%2C%20Montana\"&gt;Deer Lodge, Montana&lt;/a&gt; to Lewis A. Green, a gunsmith, hunter, and chef from &lt;a href=\"South%20Dakota\"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, and Perl Melvina \"Millie\" Burch, a native of Deer Lodge. Many of the details surrounding Parker's birth have been reported with little consistency. Secondary sources regarding her birth year range from 1912 to 1916, and some claim she was born in &lt;a href=\"Butte%2C%20Montana\"&gt;Butte&lt;/a&gt;, not Deer Lodge. Furthermore, some sources state her birth name as Lois Mae Green, while others indicate she was born Luise Stephanie Zelinska. Despite these discrepancies, Parker's son, Robert, insisted she was born Lois May Green in Deer Lodge in 1915, which is consistent with contemporaneous Montana birth records from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;.\nParker's parents were unemployed and experienced &lt;a href=\"poverty\"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in her early childhood, between ages 6 and 10, she was adopted by the Spickard family of &lt;a href=\"Pasadena%2C%20California\"&gt;Pasadena, California&lt;/a&gt;. She relocated there, and attended elementary school before graduating from Pasadena's &lt;a href=\"John%20Muir%20High%20School%20%28Pasadena%2C%20California%29\"&gt;John Muir High School&lt;/a&gt;. Her original aspirations were in the fine arts and illustration. In 1932, at age 17, Parker\u2014then known as Lois Mae Green\u2014entered a poster illustration competition, which resulted in her photograph appearing in a Los Angeles newspaper. &lt;a href=\"Ida%20Koverman\"&gt;Ida Koverman&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant to &lt;a href=\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\"&gt;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&lt;/a&gt; (MGM) executive &lt;a href=\"Louis%20B.%20Mayer\"&gt;Louis B. Mayer&lt;/a&gt;, saw this photo and persuaded Mayer to give Parker a screen test. By Parker's account: \"My ambition was to be an artist. I had no thought of acting.\"\n1932\u20131937: Career beginnings.\nFollowing a successful screen test, Parker was signed to MGM and given her &lt;a href=\"stage%20name\"&gt;stage name&lt;/a&gt; of Jean Parker. She made her feature film debut in the drama \"&lt;a href=\"Divorce%20in%20the%20Family\"&gt;Divorce in the Family&lt;/a&gt;\" (1932), followed by an uncredited role in \"&lt;a href=\"Rasputin%20and%20the%20Empress\"&gt;Rasputin and the Empress&lt;/a&gt;\" (1932). She subsequently appeared in minor roles in the political fantasy film \"&lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Over%20the%20White%20House\"&gt;Gabriel Over the White House&lt;/a&gt;\" (1933), and the drama \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20of%20Madame%20Blanche\"&gt;The Secret of Madame Blanche&lt;/a&gt;\" (also 1933).\nIn 1933, MGM loaned Parker to &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Pictures\"&gt;Columbia Pictures&lt;/a&gt;, who provided her with larger parts in their films, beginning with a major supporting role in &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Capra\"&gt;Frank Capra&lt;/a&gt;'s comedy-drama \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20for%20a%20Day\"&gt;Lady for a Day&lt;/a&gt;\", playing the estranged daughter of an indigent saleswoman in New York City. The same year, Parker was loaned to &lt;a href=\"RKO%20Pictures\"&gt;RKO Pictures&lt;/a&gt; to appear in &lt;a href=\"George%20Cukor\"&gt;George Cukor&lt;/a&gt;'s film adaptation of \"&lt;a href=\"Little%20Women%20%281933%20film%29\"&gt;Little Women&lt;/a&gt;\", portraying &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20March\"&gt;Elizabeth March&lt;/a&gt; opposite &lt;a href=\"Katharine%20Hepburn\"&gt;Katharine Hepburn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Bennett\"&gt;Joan Bennett&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Frances%20Dee\"&gt;Frances Dee&lt;/a&gt;. She later reflected: \"Playing Beth was the hardest thing I ever did. I was scared stiff, for I had no real training in acting. To make it harder still, I was only 16 while the others were all over 24. I was terribly shy then...\u00a0but all the girls did everything they could to help me, particularly Miss Hepburn.\"\nThe following year, RKO gave Parker her first starring role in \"&lt;a href=\"Two%20Alone\"&gt;Two Alone&lt;/a&gt;\", which was followed by a series of leading roles for MGM, including in the drama \"&lt;a href=\"Sequoia%20%281934%20film%29\"&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt;\", in which she played a woman living among the sequoia forests of &lt;a href=\"northern%20California\"&gt;northern California&lt;/a&gt; raising a mountain lion and orphaned fawn; the romance \"&lt;a href=\"Operator%2013\"&gt;Operator 13&lt;/a&gt;\", in which she starred opposite &lt;a href=\"Marion%20Davies\"&gt;Marion Davies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Cooper\"&gt;Gary Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, playing a &lt;a href=\"Southern%20belle\"&gt;Southern belle&lt;/a&gt; during the American Civil War; and in the drama \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Wicked%20Woman\"&gt;A Wicked Woman&lt;/a&gt;\", in which she starred as the daughter of a woman (played by &lt;a href=\"Mady%20Christians\"&gt;Mady Christians&lt;/a&gt;) who murders her abusive husband. She also starred in the British film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ghost%20Goes%20West\"&gt;The Ghost Goes West&lt;/a&gt;\" for &lt;a href=\"United%20Artists\"&gt;United Artists&lt;/a&gt;, playing the daughter of an American businessman opposite &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Donat\"&gt;Robert Donat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elsa%20Lanchester\"&gt;Elsa Lanchester&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough forging a successful acting career at the time, Parker continued to utilize her artistic talents, contracting in June 1935 to make eight original sketches a month for a Beverly Hills shop. In December 1935, Parker became engaged to New York socialite newspaperman George E. McDonald, and eloped with him to &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Las Vegas, Nevada&lt;/a&gt; on March 22, 1936.\n1938\u20131949: Film and stage.\nIn 1938, she had the lead role in the drama \"&lt;a href=\"Romance%20of%20the%20Limberlost\"&gt;Romance of the Limberlost&lt;/a&gt;\", followed by a supporting part in RKO's comedy \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Flying%20Deuces\"&gt;The Flying Deuces&lt;/a&gt;\" (1939) opposite &lt;a href=\"Stan%20Laurel\"&gt;Stan Laurel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Hardy\"&gt;Oliver Hardy&lt;/a&gt;. On November 9, 1939 she opened the Downtown Theatre in &lt;a href=\"Oakland%2C%20California\"&gt;Oakland, California&lt;/a&gt;, and in December 1941, at the Orinda Theater in &lt;a href=\"Contra%20Costa%20County\"&gt;Contra Costa County&lt;/a&gt;. In January 1940, after four years of marriage to McDonald, Parker was granted an interlocutory decree of divorce, which was finalized on January 23, 1941. On February 14, 1941, Parker married Los Angeles radio commentator Henry Dawson Sanders, known professionally as Douglas Dawson. Beginning in September 1941, the couple operated a flying service (the Dawson-Parker Parker Flying Service) from &lt;a href=\"Palm%20Springs%20Airport\"&gt;Palm Springs Airport&lt;/a&gt; in California, which was eventually shuttered at the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. In July 1942, Sanders joined the United States Coast Guard, and in September 1942 the couple were separated preceding their July 1943 divorce. A month after she was granted her final divorce decree on July 29, 1944, Parker married Dr. Kurt \"Curtis\" Arthur Grotter, a Hollywood insurance broker and former correspondent for a group of Czechoslovakian newspapers and active with the Braille Institute in Los Angeles, as he had a substantial loss of vision.\nParker remained active in film throughout the war, playing opposite &lt;a href=\"Lon%20Chaney%20Jr.\"&gt;Lon Chaney Jr.&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"film%20noir\"&gt;film noir&lt;/a&gt; thriller \"&lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Eyes\"&gt;Dead Man's Eyes&lt;/a&gt;\" (1944). For &lt;a href=\"Monogram%20Pictures\"&gt;Monogram Pictures&lt;/a&gt;, she inaugurated the Kitty O'Day mystery film series, playing the title character in two films: \"&lt;a href=\"Detective%20Kitty%20O%27Day\"&gt;Detective Kitty O'Day&lt;/a&gt;\" (1944), and \"&lt;a href=\"Adventures%20of%20Kitty%20O%27Day\"&gt;Adventures of Kitty O'Day&lt;/a&gt;\" (1945). In the latter part of the 1940s, Parker appeared in several stage productions: She made her &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20theatre\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; debut in the title role of the comedy \"Loco\" in 1946. Journalist Lee Evans of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cincinnati%20Enquirer\"&gt;The Cincinnati Enquirer&lt;/a&gt;\" gave the play a middling review, noting that while the play was \"fairly well acted,\" Parker \"does not create any great stir with her performance.\" Parker returned to Broadway with a starring role opposite &lt;a href=\"Bert%20Lahr\"&gt;Bert Lahr&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Burlesque%20%28play%29\"&gt;Burlesque&lt;/a&gt;\" (1946\u20131947).\nIn late 1948, she replaced &lt;a href=\"Judy%20Holliday\"&gt;Judy Holliday&lt;/a&gt; in the national touring Broadway production of \"&lt;a href=\"Born%20Yesterday%20%28play%29\"&gt;Born Yesterday&lt;/a&gt;\", co-starring with &lt;a href=\"Lon%20Chaney%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Lon Chaney, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;. Her performance in the production was well received by audiences. A review of the October 1948 Philadelphia premiere by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer\"&gt;The Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/a&gt;\" gave the production a rave review, noting: \"To say that piquant and personable Miss Parker, and Chaney as her uncouth, comedy &lt;a href=\"Caliban\"&gt;Caliban&lt;/a&gt;, play their parts as though they had been written for them, is the highest possible praise, but is amply merited for the zestful spontaneity of their performances.\" In the summer of 1949, Parker appeared in a production of the comedy play \"Light Up the Sky\", opposite &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20Peck\"&gt;Gregory Peck&lt;/a&gt;, which opened at the &lt;a href=\"La%20Jolla%20Playhouse\"&gt;La Jolla Playhouse&lt;/a&gt; before having touring performances throughout the fall of that year. On December 29, 1949, Parker and her third husband, Grotter, were granted a divorced following their July 1949 separation. In April 1947, Jean Parker Christened Seaboard Air Line passenger train, \"The Silver Comet\" at New York's Penn station, before the trains first run to Birmingham, Alabama.\n1950\u20132005: Later career and retirement.\nParker and Chaney continued to appear in touring productions of \"Born Yesterday\" through 1950. Also in 1950, Parker returned to film with a supporting role in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gunfighter%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Gunfighter&lt;/a&gt;\" opposite Gregory Peck, playing a saloon singer. The following year, in 1951, while appearing at a nightclub in &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney, Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Parker made international headlines when she was escorted off &lt;a href=\"Bondi%20Beach%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Bondi Beach&lt;/a&gt; by swimsuit inspector Abe Laidlaw, who measured her bikini and determined it was too skimpy.\nOn May 19, 1951, Parker secretly married actor &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Lowery%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Robert Lowery Hanks&lt;/a&gt; at the home of a friend in &lt;a href=\"Hialeah%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Hialeah, Florida&lt;/a&gt;. The two had previously co-starred in the 1944 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Navy%20Way\"&gt;The Navy Way&lt;/a&gt;\". In late 1951, Parker and Lowery co-starred in a touring stage production of &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Kingsley\"&gt;Sidney Kingsley&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Detective%20Story%20%28play%29\"&gt;Detective Story&lt;/a&gt;\". Critic Harold Whitehead, reviewing a &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; performance of the play, observed that Parker seemed \"shaky and ill-at-ease\" throughout. The following year, on September 24, 1952, Parker gave birth to her only child, a son, Robert Lowery Hanks II, in Los Angeles.\nParker continued to appear occasionally in films throughout the remainder of the 1950s, including a starring role opposite &lt;a href=\"Edward%20G.%20Robinson\"&gt;Edward G. Robinson&lt;/a&gt; in the film noir \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Tuesday%20%28film%29\"&gt;Black Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;\" (1954), followed by a role in \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Lawless%20Street\"&gt;A Lawless Street&lt;/a&gt;\" (1955). In 1954, Parker played the role of \"&lt;a href=\"Ellen%20Watson\"&gt;Cattle Kate Watson of Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;\" in an episode of the syndicated television series \"&lt;a href=\"Stories%20of%20the%20Century\"&gt;Stories of the Century&lt;/a&gt;\", the first &lt;a href=\"Western%20%28genre%29\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; program to win an &lt;a href=\"Emmy%20Award\"&gt;Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt;. The series starred and was narrated by &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Davis%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Jim Davis&lt;/a&gt;. Later in her career and life, Parker continued a successful stint on the West Coast theatre circuit and worked as an acting coach. Parker filed for divorce from her fourth husband, Lowery, in September 1957, but it was never finalized. She made her last film appearance was in \"&lt;a href=\"Apache%20Uprising\"&gt;Apache Uprising&lt;/a&gt;\" (1965).\nParker worked as an &lt;a href=\"acting%20coach\"&gt;acting coach&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s for a time, but spent the following several decades largely out of the public eye, earning a reputation as a \"Hollywood recluse.\"\nIn 1998, she moved into the &lt;a href=\"Motion%20Picture%20and%20Television%20Country%20House%20and%20Hospital\"&gt;Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Woodland Hills&lt;/a&gt; section of Los Angeles.\nDeath.\nParker died of a &lt;a href=\"stroke\"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital on November 30, 2005. She is interred at the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Lawn%20Memorial%20Park%20%28Hollywood%20Hills%29\"&gt;Forest Lawn Memorial Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Hills\"&gt;Hollywood Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nIn the 1950s, columnist &lt;a href=\"Erskine%20Johnson\"&gt;Erskine Johnson&lt;/a&gt; deemed Parker \"the &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Taylor\"&gt;Liz Taylor&lt;/a&gt; of the 1930s.\" Upon her death, journalist Ronald Bergan noted Parker as an undervalued actress whose career was stifled by the studio system who gave her \"too little chance to shine.\""
