    "text": "Heinrich Kaspar Schmid (11 September 1874 \u2013 8 January 1953) was a German &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSchmid was born at &lt;a href=\"Landau\"&gt;Landau&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a boy he studied music with his father who was a school teacher and choral conductor. He also sang in the boys choir at &lt;a href=\"Regensburg%20Cathedral\"&gt;Regensburg Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; for several years. He entered the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20Akademie%20der%20Tonkunst\"&gt;Munich Akademie der Tonkunst&lt;/a&gt; where he studied composition with &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Thuille\"&gt;Ludwig Thuille&lt;/a&gt;. In 1905 he was appointed to teach at the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20Academy\"&gt;Munich Academy&lt;/a&gt; and in 1919 was promoted to a full professor. After &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, Schmid entered a highly successful part of his career both as a performer and composer. He toured throughout &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1921 he became director of the &lt;a href=\"Karlsruhe%20Conservatory\"&gt;Karlsruhe Conservatory&lt;/a&gt; and assumed the directorship of the &lt;a href=\"Augsburg%20Music%20School\"&gt;Augsburg Music School&lt;/a&gt; [now Conservatory] in 1924. He retired from academic work in 1932.\nHe died at &lt;a href=\"Geiselbullach\"&gt;Geiselbullach&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;, in 1953.\nWork.\nStylistically, Schmid's compositions were more in keeping with the late-&lt;a href=\"romantic%20music\"&gt;Romantics&lt;/a&gt; than with 20th-century innovations. &lt;a href=\"Brahms\"&gt;Brahms&lt;/a&gt; in particular had a major influence on Schmid's compositional sensibility. This is particularly evident in the &lt;a href=\"sonatas\"&gt;sonatas&lt;/a&gt; for violin and piano (1920, 1939). His best work is probably his \"Symphony in D Minor\" (1947) which was admired for its fresh and accomplished treatment of traditional musical materials. Elements of Bavarian &lt;a href=\"folk%20music\"&gt;folk music&lt;/a&gt; appear in the rural &lt;a href=\"mass%20%28music%29\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; settings, &lt;a href=\"choral\"&gt;choral&lt;/a&gt; compositions, \"&lt;a href=\"lieder\"&gt;lieder&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"chamber%20works\"&gt;chamber works&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; \"Finden und Meiden\"."
