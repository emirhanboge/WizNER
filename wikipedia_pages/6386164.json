    "text": "Hot &amp; Wet is the fourth studio album by American &lt;a href=\"R%26amp%3BB\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"112%20%28band%29\"&gt;112&lt;/a&gt;. The album followed the successful \"&lt;a href=\"Part%20III\"&gt;Part III&lt;/a&gt;\" album (which featured the hit single \"&lt;a href=\"Peaches%20%26amp%3B%20Cream%20%28112%20song%29\"&gt;Peaches &amp; Cream&lt;/a&gt;\"), with the club tracks \"Na Na Na Na\" and \"Hot &amp; Wet\" which was produced by &lt;a href=\"Stevie%20J\"&gt;Stevie J&lt;/a&gt;. It was also their first album not exclusively associated with &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Boy%20Records\"&gt;Bad Boy Records&lt;/a&gt;, signaling the groups' eventual departure from the label in 2004.\nBackground.\nIn 2002 the group members, having matured both personally and professionally, came to the realization that a split with the Bad Boy label was necessary due to the lack of interest. In search of greater creative control, 112 left Bad Boy Records in February 2002 and signed with Def Jam in July on their &lt;a href=\"Def%20Soul\"&gt;Def Soul&lt;/a&gt;-imprint, insisting that the breakup was amicable. They reiterated this \"no-hard-feelings\" attitude by going to Daddy's House to record a debut album for Def Jam. Disagreements remained over ownership rights to the 112 catalog of songs, and this album - the Def Jam debut disc was waylaid as a result, while negotiations ensued between Lyor Cohen of Def Jam and Bad Boy owner Combs. With both sides ultimately in agreement, Hot &amp; Wet would eventually appear in November 2003.\nReception.\nCommercial.\nIn 2004, the album charted on the Billboard 200 and peaked at number four on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album however failed to make any noticeable impression on the charts."
