No services operated north of Vavuniya after 1990 due to the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lankan%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;. Reconstruction of this section of the line commenced following the end of the civil war in 2009. Currently services operate up to &lt;a href=\"Pallai%20railway%20station\"&gt;Pallai&lt;/a&gt;."
