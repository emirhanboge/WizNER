Two years later, in 1996, they released \"K\u00f6ld eru kvennar\u00e1\u00f0\" (\"Cold are the counsels of women,\" likely referencing a famous line from &lt;a href=\"Nj%C3%A1ls%20saga\"&gt;Nj\u00e1ls saga&lt;/a&gt;).\nThey also released \"Stranger Tales\" in 1995, which featured some &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; versions of &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20language\"&gt;Icelandic&lt;/a&gt; songs. This was also their first &lt;a href=\"Compact%20disc\"&gt;CD&lt;/a&gt; published under the name Bellatrix. This was followed by \"G\" in 1998 released on Global Warming Records.

The following year, they released \"It's All True\" with Fierce Panda. Their &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt;, \"Jedi Wannabe\", peaked at #65 in the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; in September 2000. They broke up the following year, with most of the band returning to Iceland except El\u00edza, who remained in London to continue studying music."
