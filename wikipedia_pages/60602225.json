Casey had been a late call-up to the bench for Munster after the starting scrum-half, &lt;a href=\"Conor%20Murray\"&gt;Conor Murray&lt;/a&gt;, withdrew during the warm-up and &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Cronin\"&gt;Neil Cronin&lt;/a&gt; was promoted to the starting XV. He joined the provinces senior squad ahead of the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Munster%20Rugby%20season\"&gt;2019\u201320&lt;/a&gt; season on a development contract, before progressing to a full contract ahead of the 2020\u201321 season.\nCasey made his first start for Munster in their 19\u201314 away win against &lt;a href=\"Connacht%20Rugby\"&gt;Connacht&lt;/a&gt; in round 8 of the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Pro14\"&gt;2019\u201320 Pro14&lt;/a&gt; on 21 December 2019, and he made his European debut for the province in their 39\u201322 defeat away to French club &lt;a href=\"Racing%2092\"&gt;Racing 92&lt;/a&gt; in round 5 of the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20European%20Rugby%20Champions%20Cup%20pool%20stage%23Pool%204\"&gt;2019\u201320 Champions Cup&lt;/a&gt; on 12 January 2020.

Casey's performances for Munster throughout the 2020\u201321 season saw him win the clubs \"Young Player of the Year\" award.\nIreland.\nCasey had been in contention for selection for &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20under-20%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Ireland under-20s&lt;/a&gt; during 2018, but a series of injuries ruled him out. Having overcome his injury issues, Casey was named as vice-captain in the under-20s squad for the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Six%20Nations%20Under%2020s%20Championship\"&gt;2019 Six Nations Under 20s Championship&lt;/a&gt;, and made three appearances, scoring two tries, during the tournament, which saw Ireland secure a grand slam victory for the first time since 2007.

Casey earned his first senior international call up in January 2021, when Andy Farrell announced the Ireland squad for the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;2021 Six Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt;, and he made his senior debut against &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; in round 3 on 27 February 2021, coming on as a replacement for &lt;a href=\"Jamison%20Gibson-Park\"&gt;Jamison Gibson-Park&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland's 48\u201310 away win. Ireland captain &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Sexton\"&gt;Jonathan Sexton&lt;/a&gt; remarked after the game that Casey's attitude reminded him of &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; legend &lt;a href=\"Jonny%20Wilkinson\"&gt;Jonny Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt;.\nCasey made his first start for Ireland in their &lt;a href=\"2021%20July%20rugby%20union%20tests\"&gt;mid-year test&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on 10 July 2021, which Ireland won 71\u201310, and featured off the bench in the 53\u20137 win against &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland's final fixture of the &lt;a href=\"2021%20end-of-year%20rugby%20union%20internationals\"&gt;2021 Autumn Nations Series&lt;/a&gt; on 21 November.\nStatistics.\nInternational analysis by opposition.\nCorrect as of 21 November 2021"
