Both her sire and her dam's sire were products of the &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranch\"&gt;King Ranch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"linebreeding\"&gt;linebreeding&lt;/a&gt; program, so Quo Vadis was descended from &lt;a href=\"Old%20Sorrel%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Old Sorrel&lt;/a&gt; twice. She also traced five times to &lt;a href=\"Peter%20McCue%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Peter McCue&lt;/a&gt; as well as once to &lt;a href=\"Traveler%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Traveler&lt;/a&gt;.\nShow career.\nIn Quo Vadis' show career, she earned an AQHA Championship as well as a Performance Register of Merit.

She also earned $208.40 in &lt;a href=\"National%20Cutting%20Horse%20Association\"&gt;National Cutting Horse Association&lt;/a&gt; (or NCHA) cutting competition.\nBroodmare record.\nAfter Quo Vadis' show career, she retired to become a broodmare.

Four of them became AQHA Champions \u2013 Mr. Perfection, Poco Becky, Bonita Dondi, and Kaliman. Three foals earned a Superior Halter Horse award \u2013 Madonna Dell, Mr. Perfection, and Kaliman. She also foaled Majestic Dell, a stallion who earned forty-nine halter points, just one shy of his Superior Halter Horse.\nHonors.\nQuo Vadis was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;AQHA Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 2002."
