    "text": "Georgios Papandreou ( \"Ge\u00f3rgios Papandr\u00e9ou\"; 13 February 1888 \u2013 1 November 1968) was a &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; politician, the founder of the Papandreou &lt;a href=\"political%20dynasty\"&gt;political dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. He served three terms as &lt;a href=\"prime%20minister%20of%20Greece\"&gt;prime minister of Greece&lt;/a&gt; (1944\u20131945, 1963, 1964\u20131965). He was also &lt;a href=\"deputy%20prime%20minister\"&gt;deputy prime minister&lt;/a&gt; from 1950\u20131952, in the governments of &lt;a href=\"Nikolaos%20Plastiras\"&gt;Nikolaos Plastiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sofoklis%20Venizelos\"&gt;Sofoklis Venizelos&lt;/a&gt; and served numerous times as a cabinet minister, starting in 1923, in a political career that spanned more than five decades.\nEarly life.\nPapandreou was born at &lt;a href=\"Kalentzi\"&gt;Kalentzi&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Achaea\"&gt;Achaea&lt;/a&gt; region of the northern &lt;a href=\"Peloponnese\"&gt;Peloponnese&lt;/a&gt;. He was the son of Father Andreas Stavropoulos, an Orthodox &lt;a href=\"archpriest\"&gt;archpriest&lt;/a&gt; (protopresvyteros). His last name is derived from his father's Christian name and the word \"papas\" \"priest\". He studied &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"political%20science\"&gt;political science&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. His political philosophy was heavily influenced by German &lt;a href=\"social%20democracy\"&gt;social democracy&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, he was adamantly opposed to the monarchy and supported generous social policies, but he was also extremely &lt;a href=\"anti-communist\"&gt;anti-communist&lt;/a&gt; (and specifically against the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Greece\"&gt;KKE&lt;/a&gt;'s policies in Greece). As a young man, he became involved in politics as a supporter of the Liberal leader &lt;a href=\"Eleftherios%20Venizelos\"&gt;Eleftherios Venizelos&lt;/a&gt;, who made him governor of &lt;a href=\"Chios\"&gt;Chios&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20Wars\"&gt;Balkan Wars&lt;/a&gt;. One of his brothers, Nikos, was killed in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kilkis-Lachanas\"&gt;Battle of Kilkis-Lachanas&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe married twice. His first wife was Sofia Mineyko, a &lt;a href=\"Poles\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; national, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Zygmunt%20Mineyko\"&gt;Zygmunt Mineyko&lt;/a&gt; and paternal granddaughter of Stanislaw Mineyko (1802\u20131857). Their son &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Papandreou\"&gt;Andreas Papandreou&lt;/a&gt; was born in &lt;a href=\"Chios\"&gt;Chios&lt;/a&gt; in 1919. His second wife was the actress &lt;a href=\"Cybele%20Andrianou\"&gt;Cybele Andrianou&lt;/a&gt; and their son was named George Papandreou.\nPolitical career.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"National%20Schism\"&gt;the political crisis&lt;/a&gt; surrounding &lt;a href=\"Greece%20in%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Greece's entry&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, Papandreou was one of Venizelos's closest supporters against the pro-German monarch, &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20I%20of%20the%20Hellenes\"&gt;King Konstant\u00ednos I&lt;/a&gt;. When Venizelos in 1916 left Athens, Papandreou accompanied him to &lt;a href=\"Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt;, and then went to &lt;a href=\"Lesbos\"&gt;Lesbos&lt;/a&gt;, where he mobilised anti-monarchist supporters in the islands and rallied support for Venizelos's insurgent &lt;a href=\"Movement%20of%20National%20Defence\"&gt;pro-Allied government in Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1920%20Greek%20legislative%20election\"&gt;1920 general election&lt;/a&gt;, Papandreou unsuccessfully ran as an independent liberal in the &lt;a href=\"Lesbos\"&gt;Lesbos&lt;/a&gt; constituency. In 1921 as a lawyer he defended &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Papanastasiou\"&gt;Alexandros Papanastasiou&lt;/a&gt;, during a trial for his critic against King Konstant\u00ednos. Because of an article calling on King Konstant\u00ednos to abdicate, he was imprisoned by the royalist regime and later he narrowly escaped assassination from royalist extremists in Lesbos.\nFrom January to October 1923, he served as &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20and%20Administrative%20Reconstruction\"&gt;interior minister&lt;/a&gt; in the cabinet of &lt;a href=\"Stylianos%20Gonatas\"&gt;Stylianos Gonatas&lt;/a&gt;. In the December &lt;a href=\"1923%20Greek%20legislative%20election\"&gt;1923 elections&lt;/a&gt;, he was elected as a &lt;a href=\"Venizelism\"&gt;Venizelist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; member of parliament for &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9svos\"&gt;L\u00e9svos&lt;/a&gt;, and served as finance minister for just 11 days in June 1925, education minister in 1930\u20131932 and transport minister in 1933. As minister of education he reformed the Greek school system and built many schools for the children of refugees of the &lt;a href=\"Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281919%E2%80%9322%29\"&gt;Greco-Turkish War&lt;/a&gt;. During the dictatorship of Pangalos, he was again imprisoned.\nIn 1935, he set up the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Socialist%20Party%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Democratic Socialist Party of Greece&lt;/a&gt;. The same year, a royalist coup by &lt;a href=\"General\"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Georgios%20Kondylis\"&gt;Ge\u00f3rgios Kondylis&lt;/a&gt; took place for the re-establishment of monarchy and he was placed in internal exile. A lifelong opponent of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20monarchy\"&gt;Greek monarchy&lt;/a&gt;, he was again exiled in 1938 by the Greek royalist dictator &lt;a href=\"Ioannis%20Metaxas\"&gt;Ioannis Metaxas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Axis%20occupation%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Axis occupation of Greece&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, he was imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Fascist%20Italy%20%281922%E2%80%931943%29\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; authorities. He later fled to the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; and joined the predominantly Venizelist government-in-exile based in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;Kingdom of Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. With British support, &lt;a href=\"George%20II%20of%20the%20Hellenes\"&gt;King Ge\u00f3rgios II&lt;/a&gt; appointed him as Prime Minister, and under his premiership took place the &lt;a href=\"Lebanon%20conference\"&gt;Lebanon conference&lt;/a&gt; (May 1944) and later the &lt;a href=\"Caserta%20Agreement\"&gt;Caserta Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (September 1944), in an attempt to stop the crisis in Greece and the conflicts between &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberation%20Front%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;EAM&lt;/a&gt; and non-EAM forces (a prelude of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;) and establish a national unity government.\nLiberation of Greece and the \"Dekemvrian\u00e1\" events.\nAfter the evacuation of Greece by the Axis powers, he entered &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; (October 1944) as Prime Minister of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20government-in-exile\"&gt;Greek government-in-exile&lt;/a&gt; with some units of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Army\"&gt;Greek Army&lt;/a&gt; and the allied British. During the same month, he became Prime Minister in the , which had succeeded the Greek government-in-exile. He tried to normalise the highly polarised situation between the EAM and non-EAM forces, collaborating mainly with &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant-General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Lieutenant-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Scobie\"&gt;Sir Ronald Scobie&lt;/a&gt;, who was, after the Caserta agreement, responsible for all the Allied forces.\nAlthough he resigned in 1945, after the \"&lt;a href=\"Dekemvriana\"&gt;Dekemvriana&lt;/a&gt;\" events, he continued to hold high office. From 1946\u20131952 he served as labour minister, supplies minister, education minister, finance minister and public order minister. In 1950\u20131952, he was also &lt;a href=\"deputy%20prime%20minister\"&gt;deputy prime minister&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 1952\u20131961 period was a very difficult one for Papandreou. The liberal political forces in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Greece\"&gt;Kingdom of Greece&lt;/a&gt; were gravely weakened by internal disputes and suffered electoral defeat from the conservatives. Papandreou continuously accused &lt;a href=\"Sofoklis%20Venizelos\"&gt;Sofoklis Venizelos&lt;/a&gt; for these maladies, considering his leadership dour and uninspiring.\nFounder of the Centre Union and later confrontation with the Palace.\nIn 1961, Papandreou revived Greek liberalism by founding the &lt;a href=\"Centre%20Union\"&gt;Centre Union&lt;/a&gt; Party, a confederation of old liberal Venizelists, social democrats and dissatisfied conservatives. After the &lt;a href=\"1961%20Greek%20legislative%20election\"&gt;elections&lt;/a&gt; of \"violence and fraud\" of 1961, Papandreou declared a \"&lt;a href=\"Relentless%20Struggle\"&gt;Relentless Struggle&lt;/a&gt;\" against the right-wing &lt;a href=\"National%20Radical%20Union\"&gt;ERE&lt;/a&gt; and the \"parakr\u00e1tos\" (deep state) of the right.\nFinally, his party won the &lt;a href=\"1963%20Greek%20legislative%20election\"&gt;elections&lt;/a&gt; of November 1963 and those of 1964, the second with a &lt;a href=\"1964%20Greek%20legislative%20election\"&gt;landslide majority&lt;/a&gt;. His progressive policies as premier aroused much opposition in conservative circles, as did the prominent role played by his son &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Papandreou\"&gt;Andreas Papandreou&lt;/a&gt;, whose policies were seen as being considerably left of center. Andreas disagreed with his father on many important issues, and developed a network of political organizations, the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Leagues\"&gt;Democratic Leagues&lt;/a&gt; (\"Dimokratikoi Syndesmoi\") to lobby for more progressive policies. He also managed to take control of the Center Union's youth organization, &lt;a href=\"EDIN\"&gt;EDIN&lt;/a&gt;.\nPapandreou had opposed the &lt;a href=\"Z%C3%BCrich%20and%20London%20Agreement\"&gt;Z\u00fcrich and London Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the foundation of the Republic of &lt;a href=\"Cyprus\"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;. Following clashes between the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Cypriots\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Cypriots\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; communities, his government sent a &lt;a href=\"Greek%20army\"&gt;Greek army&lt;/a&gt; division to the island.\n&lt;a href=\"Majesty\"&gt;His Majesty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20II%20of%20the%20Hellenes\"&gt;King Konstant\u00ednos II&lt;/a&gt; openly opposed Papandreou's government, and there were frequent ultra-rightist plots in the Army, which destabilised the government. Finally, the King engineered a split in the Centre Union, and in July 1965, in a crisis known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Apostasia%20of%201965\"&gt;Apostasia&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"Iouliana,\" His Majesty dismissed the government following a dispute over control of the Ministry of Defence.\nAfter the April 1967 military coup by the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20military%20junta%20of%201967-1974\"&gt;Colonels' junta&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Georgios%20Papadopoulos\"&gt;George Papadopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, Papandreou was arrested. Papandreou died under house arrest in November 1968. His funeral became the occasion for a massive anti-dictatorship demonstration. He is interred at the &lt;a href=\"First%20Cemetery%20of%20Athens\"&gt;First Cemetery of Athens&lt;/a&gt;, alongside his son Andreas.\nLegacy.\nPapandreou was regarded as one of the best &lt;a href=\"orator\"&gt;orator&lt;/a&gt;s in the Greek political scene and a persistent fighter for Democracy. During the junta and after his death he was often referred to affectionately as \"\u03bf \u0393\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2\" (\"o G\u00e9ros tis Dimokrat\u00edas, the old man of Democracy\"). Since his grandson &lt;a href=\"George%20Papandreou\"&gt;George A. Papandreou&lt;/a&gt; entered politics, most Greek writers use \u0393\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (\"Ge\u00f3rgios\") to refer to the grandfather and the less formal \u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (\"Gi\u00f3rgos\") to refer to the grandson.\nDecorations and awards.\nIn 1965, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Belgrade\"&gt;University of Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; awarded him an &lt;a href=\"honorary%20doctorate\"&gt;honorary doctorate&lt;/a&gt;."
