With the new easy access to market data towards the end of the 1990s, Boyle started to study the statistical properties of markets. \"I thought it might be a smart approach if I analyzed as much data as possible so I could speak knowledgeably about stocks; even if I hadn't lived through the various periods, I could at least be a history student of the market.\"\nBoyles studies became more statistical in their nature and he enjoyed a couple of early successes, applying his theories to investment. He realized over time that certain rules work better than others and developed his own approach to the markets.\nBoyle read about Victor Niederhoffer, admired his statistical approach and began corresponding with Niederhoffer sharing his statistical studies as to how markets behaved. Niederhoffer liked what he saw and made Boyle a job offer.\nIn 2001 he began working for &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Niederhoffer\"&gt;Victor Niederhoffer&lt;/a&gt;, a former partner of &lt;a href=\"George%20Soros\"&gt;George Soros&lt;/a&gt;' as a financial derivatives trader. Boyle has since been a Portfolio Manager at &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Bank%20of%20Scotland%20Group\"&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Millennium%20Management%2C%20LLC\"&gt;Millennium Management, LLC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nomura%20Securities\"&gt;Nomura Securities&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoyle founded Palomar Capital Management, a multi award-winning hedge fund in 2011 along with his business partner Jesse McDougall. At Palomar, Boyle wrote computer code that enters hundreds of trades a day in global markets that has a win rate of 65%. Investors in Palomar include Stanley Fink, Larry Hite and Victor Niederhoffer.\nAcademic career.\nBoyle is Professor of Finance at Kings Business School, &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20College%20London\"&gt;King's College London&lt;/a&gt; since 2017.
