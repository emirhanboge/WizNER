    "text": "Jodie Alicia Williams (born 28 September 1993) is a British &lt;a href=\"Sprint%20%28running%29\"&gt;sprinter&lt;/a&gt; who specialises in the &lt;a href=\"400%20metres\"&gt;400 metres&lt;/a&gt;, having begun her career concentrating on &lt;a href=\"100%20metres\"&gt;100&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"200%20metres\"&gt;200 metres&lt;/a&gt;. A prodigious junior, she is the 2009 &lt;a href=\"IAAF%20World%20Youth%20Championships%20in%20Athletics\"&gt;World Youth Champion&lt;/a&gt; at 100 and 200 m, the 2010 &lt;a href=\"IAAF%20World%20Junior%20Championships%20in%20Athletics\"&gt;World Junior Champion&lt;/a&gt; at 100 m, the 2011 &lt;a href=\"2011%20European%20Athletics%20Junior%20Championships\"&gt;European Junior Champion&lt;/a&gt; at 100 m and 200 m, and the 2013 European U23 Champion at 200 m.\nWilliams had a five-year-long unbeaten streak of 151 races in the sprints, beginning with the start of her &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt; career in 2005 and lasting until July 2010, when she was runner-up to &lt;a href=\"Stormy%20Kendrick\"&gt;Stormy Kendrick&lt;/a&gt; in the 200\u00a0m at the &lt;a href=\"2010%20World%20Junior%20Championships%20in%20Athletics\"&gt;World Junior Championships&lt;/a&gt;. Williams is the British youth record holder over the &lt;a href=\"60%20metres\"&gt;60\u00a0m&lt;/a&gt;, 100\u00a0m and 200\u00a0m. At the age of sixteen, she was the top-ranked British woman over 200\u00a0m in 2010.\nAfter a difficult beginning to her senior career following injuries, in 2014 Williams won her first senior medals, representing England at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;2014 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;; a bronze in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay, and a silver in the 200 metres. Weeks later she repeated the silver medal for 200 metres at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20European%20Athletics%20Championships\"&gt;2014 European Championships&lt;/a&gt;, before winning her first senior gold medal as part of the Great Britain relay team that broke the &lt;a href=\"British%20records%20in%20athletics\"&gt;British Record&lt;/a&gt; in the 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay.\nBackground.\nWilliams was born in &lt;a href=\"Welwyn%20Garden%20City\"&gt;Welwyn Garden City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hertfordshire\"&gt;Hertfordshire&lt;/a&gt; to an English father, Richard Williams, and an &lt;a href=\"English%20people\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; mother of &lt;a href=\"Trinidadian\"&gt;Trinidadian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Vincent%20and%20the%20Grenadines\"&gt;Vincentian&lt;/a&gt; descent, Christine Williams. Both of her parents were county-level sprinters. Richard ran for &lt;a href=\"Hertfordshire\"&gt;Hertfordshire&lt;/a&gt;, while Christine ran for &lt;a href=\"Sussex\"&gt;Sussex&lt;/a&gt;. She also has two siblings, her younger brother Ben and younger sister &lt;a href=\"Hannah%20Williams%20%28athlete%29\"&gt;Hannah Williams&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilliams began to take athletics seriously when she was 13 years old.\nWilliams was educated at &lt;a href=\"Heath%20Mount%20School\"&gt;Heath Mount School&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queenswood%20School\"&gt;Queenswood School&lt;/a&gt;, Hertfordshire, before attending &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Alice%20Owen%27s%20School\"&gt;Dame Alice Owen's School&lt;/a&gt;, in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire.\nWilliams has been described as the \"sort of athlete every country is waiting for\" by former &lt;a href=\"UK%20Athletics\"&gt;UK Athletics&lt;/a&gt; Head Coach, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Van%20Commenee\"&gt;Charles Van Commenee&lt;/a&gt;, and has also been praised by &lt;a href=\"Allyson%20Felix\"&gt;Allyson Felix&lt;/a&gt;, who stated \"I think Jodie has great potential. She's young but she can still accomplish a lot of things\".\n2009 World Youth Champion.\nShe took the England Athletics Under-20 Championships in 100\u00a0m, in a time of 11.48\u00a0s. She then went to &lt;a href=\"Brixen\"&gt;Brixen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"IAAF%20World%20Youth%20Championships%20in%20Athletics\"&gt;World Youth Championships&lt;/a&gt; to take part in the 100\u00a0m and 200\u00a0m. In the 100\u00a0m semi-final, she set a world-leading time for a youth athlete of 11.40\u00a0s. In the event final she ran 0.01\u00a0s quicker to clinch her first world title, defeating &lt;a href=\"Ashton%20Purvis\"&gt;Ashton Purvis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alison%20Peter\"&gt;Alison Peter&lt;/a&gt;. In the 200\u00a0m final, she ran another youth world leading time of 23.08\u00a0s to clinch another &lt;a href=\"gold%20medal\"&gt;gold medal&lt;/a&gt;, making her the first girl to achieve a 100/200\u00a0m sprint double at the competition.\n2010 World Junior Championships.\nIn 2010, Williams started off her season in strong form \u2013 at the Loughborough Games, she broke the 200\u00a0m British junior record when she ran 22.79\u00a0s, beating a strong field including senior Olympian &lt;a href=\"Joice%20Maduaka\"&gt;Joice Maduaka&lt;/a&gt;. A week later, at the Bedford International Games, she broke the 100\u00a0m British junior record when she ran 11.24\u00a0s. After winning both the events at the England Athletics U20 Championships, she set off for the &lt;a href=\"2010%20World%20Junior%20Championships%20in%20Athletics\"&gt;2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics&lt;/a&gt;, which were to be held in &lt;a href=\"Moncton\"&gt;Moncton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilliams carried on her unbeaten run by winning the 100\u00a0m final in a time of 11.40\u00a0s to make it 149 races unbeaten. After the race she said \"I thought if I got off to a good start I\u2019d be in with a good chance and that\u2019s just what I did. I knew it was going be a close race and I wasn\u2019t quite sure I could come out and perform again, so it\u2019s obviously a huge relief and the pressure has lifted a bit.\"\nThe next day it was the 200\u00a0m. She came first in her heat and semi final. Williams was the fastest qualifier, but suffered her first defeat in her athletics career by coming second in the final to &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stormy%20Kendrick\"&gt;Stormy Kendrick&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"4%20x%20100%20metres%20relay\"&gt;4 \u00d7 100 m relay&lt;/a&gt; the Great Britain team was eliminated due to a bad baton exchange between Williams and &lt;a href=\"Rebekah%20Wilson\"&gt;Rebekah Wilson&lt;/a&gt;.\n2011 Indoor Season &amp; Double European Junior Champion.\nIn 2011, Williams became the youngest winner of the UK Indoor Championships over the 60\u00a0m, since 15-year-old &lt;a href=\"Sonia%20Lannaman\"&gt;Sonia Lannaman&lt;/a&gt; won in 1971. She ran a personal best of 7.24\u00a0s in a strong British field that included &lt;a href=\"Bernice%20Wilson\"&gt;Bernice Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jeanette%20Kwakye\"&gt;Jeanette Kwakye&lt;/a&gt;. This led to an automatic qualification for the &lt;a href=\"2011%20European%20Athletics%20Indoor%20Championships\"&gt;2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis has not been the first time that Williams had achieved a standard to make a senior Great Britain team, but this was the first time she had taken her place in the senior Great Britain team.\nIn Paris, Williams ran 7.21\u00a0s in the European Indoor Championships 60\u00a0m final, finishing fourth. She had missed out on a medal by 0.01\u00a0s, but despite this, she said she had \"surprised herself\".\nAt the &lt;a href=\"European%20Athletics%20Junior%20Championships\"&gt;European Athletics Junior Championships&lt;/a&gt;, Williams won the 100\u00a0m setting a new personal best and championship record of 11.18\u00a0s, breaking the previous record by 0.03\u00a0s. She explained \"I've been training better than last year and my times in training have been better than last year so I knew I had 11.1 in me, I've just not had the right conditions until today.\"\nWithin 24 hours, she also won the 200\u00a0m in a season's best of 22.94 s \u2013 despite a strong headwind of \u22121.5\u00a0m/s to complete a sprint double, an unprecedented achievement for a British woman. To end the championships, she ran on the fourth leg of the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay to collect a &lt;a href=\"bronze%20medal\"&gt;bronze medal&lt;/a&gt; along with her teammates.\n2012 Indoor Season &amp; Missing the 2012 London Olympics.\nWilliams ran a season's best time of 7.29 s and finished second behind Jeanette Kwakye at the Aviva UK Indoor Championships. She was subsequently chosen to run at the IAAF Indoor World Championships in Istanbul, Turkey. Before the championships began, Williams stated that her aim was to make the semi-finals at the championships. In the heat, she came 3rd with a time of 7.40 s and in the semi-final she came 5th with a time of 7.32 s and did not advance to the final.\nAfter the World Indoor Championships, Williams announced that she was to focus on getting selected for the 100\u00a0m at the London 2012 Games. She stated, \"Now it\u2019s onwards and upwards for the Olympics. I\u2019m really concentrating on the 100m because it\u2019s always been a dream of mine to do the 100m at the Olympics.\"\nThroughout the summer season, Williams was struggling with a number of injuries. Before the &lt;a href=\"Olympics\"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; Trials, she had only raced once, which was a time of 11.87 s (-1.3), well down on her personal best at the Watford Open Graded Meeting.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Aviva\"&gt;Aviva&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Olympics\"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; Trials &amp; UK Championships, Williams won her heat in 11.70 s (0.2) and came 4th in her semi-final in 11.66 s (-0.6). She had qualified for the final but was clearly not fully fit and heavily taped up. Unfortunately, Williams pulled up at the 60 m mark and appeared to pull her hamstring. With that result and injury, Williams ended her 2012 season.\nSpeaking about her injury-plagued 2012 season, Williams stated, \"I just had so much going on and my body just started to break down. If someone had asked me before what my worst setback was, I would have said coming second at the world juniors, but this was a proper setback. That was my first real setback year. It was hard, as I'd not been used to dealing with setbacks before.\" She added, \"It was tough to sit back and watch it, to see other people [competing], and thinking I could have been there at the home Olympics, but then I told myself I'm 18 and there's hopefully plenty more Olympics ahead of me. It wasn't nice sitting at home, and it took me a while to get over that.\"\n2013 European Under 23 Champion &amp; World Championships.\nIn the aftermath of the London Olympics, Williams said, \"My confidence took a knock as I didn't compete to the standard I would have liked to. It's hard not to have your confidence knocked from that. But I've had to just learn from the mistakes and move on.\" Commenting that she is now free of education and able to train full-time, \"I don't know how I did the last few years.\" Talking about her expectations for the 2013 season, she said, \"This year it's about getting into the senior worlds and taking it slow,\" she says. \"But long term, the goal's still the same: to be the best in the world.\"\nIn 2013, Williams did not compete during the indoor season, to presumably continue with her rehabilitation after the 2012 injuries. Her first race after the injury at the UK Olympic Trials was an unusual distance of 250 m, in which she posted a time of 30.33 s. A few weeks later, she competed over a 150 m at the Manchester Street Games alongside &lt;a href=\"Olympics\"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; Champion &lt;a href=\"Allyson%20Felix\"&gt;Allyson Felix&lt;/a&gt;, she ended up with an overall time of 16.81 s (-0.2) and went through the 100 m mark in 11.32 s (-0.2).\nOn the domestic scene, Williams comfortably clinched a 100 m/200 m double at the England Athletics U23 Championships winning the 100m at 11.56 s (0.7) and the 200 m at 23.21 s (0.5). With that, she qualified for the European Under 23 Championships in &lt;a href=\"Tampere\"&gt;Tampere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Tampere\"&gt;Tampere&lt;/a&gt;, Williams continued her comeback by winning her 100 m heat and semi-final in 11.49 s (-0.2) and 11.44 s (-0.3) respectively. In the final, she came 2nd in a time of 11.42 (-0.7) behind &lt;a href=\"Dafne%20Schippers\"&gt;Dafne Schippers&lt;/a&gt;. In the 200 m, Williams won her heat in a time of 23.09 s (-0.9). In the final, Williams posted a quicker time of 22.92 s (-0.5) to claim a gold medal at the European U23 Championships and her 6th age-group international title.\n2014 Commonwealth Games and European Championships.\nIn 2014, Williams struggled throughout the indoor season. After qualifying for the final of the British Athletics 60 m indoor final, she fainted and had to pull out. She finished her indoor season, posting a best time of 7.32 s.\nOn 19 April, Williams competed at the Tom Jones Memorial Invitational at &lt;a href=\"Gainesville%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Gainesville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. Over the 100 m, she ran a time of 11.20 s (1.3). On the same day, she competed over the 200 m and ran a personal best time of 22.76 s (0.0). That result moved her up to joint 9th on the UK all-time list for 200 m.\nIn July 2014, Williams took part in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;2014 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;, Glasgow as a competitor for England. She won her first heat in 23.42, progressing to the semi-finals where she finished second in a time of 22.64 behind &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20Okagbare\"&gt;Blessing Okagbare&lt;/a&gt; which allowed her to qualify automatically for the final. In the final, Williams won silver in a new PB of 22.50, her first senior medal. The time moved her to equal second on the UK all-time list, alongside &lt;a href=\"Abi%20Oyepitan\"&gt;Abi Oyepitan&lt;/a&gt; and behind &lt;a href=\"Kathy%20Smallwood-Cook\"&gt;Kathy Cook&lt;/a&gt;. The race was won by Okagbare with Williams' compatriot, Bianca Williams finishing in third.\nLater on during the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;2014 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;, Williams was drafted into the 4 \u00d7 100 m relay team to contest the final. The England team that consisted of Williams, Bianca Williams, Ashlee Nelson &amp; Asha Philip ran a time of 43.10 s to win a bronze medal behind Jamaica and Nigeria.\nIn August 2014, Williams took part in the 2014 European Championships in Zurich. She won her heat in 22.88s, progressing to the semi-finals, where she also won in a time of 22.90s. In the final, placed in lane 4, Williams won a silver in a new PB of 22.46s, her second individual senior medal in as many weeks. The time took her to second on the UK all-time list, behind &lt;a href=\"Kathy%20Smallwood-Cook\"&gt;Kathy Cook&lt;/a&gt;. The race was won by &lt;a href=\"Dafne%20Schippers\"&gt;Dafne Schippers&lt;/a&gt; with France's Myriam Soumare finishing in third.\nBritish Championships.\nJodie became &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20British%20champions%20in%20200%20metres\"&gt;British champion&lt;/a&gt; for the second time when winning the 200 metres event at the &lt;a href=\"2019%20British%20Athletics%20Championships\"&gt;2019 British Athletics Championships&lt;/a&gt; and her sister Hannah then won the same title at the &lt;a href=\"2020%20British%20Athletics%20Championships\"&gt;2020 British Athletics Championships&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutside Athletics.\nWilliams has been used on many advertising campaigns, most recently the &lt;a href=\"National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London\"&gt;National Portrait Gallery&lt;/a&gt; 'Road to 2012: Aiming High' exhibition also featured Williams amongst many other athletes.\nWilliams has come runner-up to &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Daley%20%28diver%29\"&gt;Tom Daley&lt;/a&gt; twice(2009 &amp; 2010) for the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award."
