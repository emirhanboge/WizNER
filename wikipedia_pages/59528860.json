    "text": "Escapade is an album by saxophonist &lt;a href=\"James%20Spaulding\"&gt;James Spaulding&lt;/a&gt; which was recorded in 1999 and released on the &lt;a href=\"HighNote%20Records\"&gt;HighNote&lt;/a&gt; label.\nReception.\nThe &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; review by Michael G. Nastos stated \"Spaulding's tart-sweet alto sax has never sounded better, while his pristine flute playing is easily in the top ten of late-'90s jazz performers. ... Spaulding shows a consistency within mainstream parameters, a real sense of teamwork with these worthy session mates, and a willingness to take chances\"."
