    "text": "Padiham Football Club are an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team based in &lt;a href=\"Padiham\"&gt;Padiham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;. As of 2019\u201320, they play in the \nHistory.\nWhen the club was formed in 1878 it was among the first football clubs in Lancashire and was well supported, attracting an attendance of 9,000 for a match against neighbours &lt;a href=\"Burnley%20F.C.\"&gt;Burnley&lt;/a&gt; in 1884. At this time Padiham's ground was on the banks of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Calder%2C%20Lancashire\"&gt;River Calder&lt;/a&gt;, hence the nickname, The Caldersiders.\nPadiham was one of the first clubs to support the legalisation of professional football. However, this backfired as they were unable to compete with clubs in larger towns such as Burnley, and the club folded in 1916. The club lost their ground during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and lay dormant until after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen in 1949 the club was resurrected with the opening of the Arbories Memorial Sports Ground. A crowd of 1,777 turned up to see their opening fixture of the season in the &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20Combination\"&gt;Lancashire Combination&lt;/a&gt; Football League.\nThey became founder members of the North West Counties Football League in 1982 but left the league in 1990. They returned in 2000 after spending \u00a3500,000 on upgrading the Arbories Memorial Sports Ground and finished in the top four of the second division in 2003 and 2005.\nThey gained promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Northern Premier League&lt;/a&gt; Division One North for season 2013/14 after winning the North West Counties Football League Premier Division in season 2012/13, but returned to the North West Counties League after being relegated two seasons later.\nRacial abuse.\nIn October 2018, a game between &lt;a href=\"Congleton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Congleton Town&lt;/a&gt; and Padiham was called off after fans subjected Padiham players to racial abuse, and Padiham players' wallets were emptied in the changing rooms during the game.\nCongleton were fined \u00a3160 for their supporters' abuse, while Padiham were fined \u00a3165 for leaving the field.\nCurrent Staff.\nMichael Morrison is the current Padiham FC manager being supported by former player Ben Hoskin (Assistant Manager) Cameron Foster (Coach) Jonathan Kyle (Goalkeeping Coach)."
