    "text": "A Government House is any residence used by &lt;a href=\"Governor-General\"&gt;Governors-General&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Governor\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant-Governor\"&gt;Lieutenant-Governor&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Government Houses serve as the venue for Governors\u2019 official business, as well as the many receptions and functions hosted by the occupant. Sometimes, the term \"Government House\" is used as a &lt;a href=\"metonym\"&gt;metonym&lt;/a&gt; for the Governor or his office.\nWhile a &lt;a href=\"Government%20House\"&gt;Government House&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"official%20residence\"&gt;official residence&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"viceroy\"&gt;viceroy&lt;/a&gt; or governor who represents the &lt;a href=\"monarch\"&gt;monarch&lt;/a&gt;, many Commonwealth nations now operate without the &lt;a href=\"British%20Monarch\"&gt;British Monarch&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20State\"&gt;Head of State&lt;/a&gt;. To avoid confusion, several of these nations refer to their &lt;a href=\"presidential%20palace\"&gt;presidential palace&lt;/a&gt;s as a \"State House\" or \"&lt;a href=\"President%27s%20House%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;President's House&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; or a member of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Family\"&gt;Royal Family&lt;/a&gt; visits a Commonwealth nation, they will often stay at the Government House, which is reported in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20Circular\"&gt;Court Circular&lt;/a&gt;. This privilege is sometimes extended to other dignitaries, but usually arrangements are made for important non-royal visitors to be accommodated at hotels, or in accommodations provided by their own country's &lt;a href=\"embassy\"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"consulate\"&gt;consulate&lt;/a&gt;.\nAsia.\nBritish Indian Empire.\nOther government residences \nEurope.\nIreland.\nPre-independence, the living arrangements of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Lord Lieutenant of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; varied according to the &lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20season%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;social calendar&lt;/a&gt;:\nAfter 1922, the Viceregal Lodge served as the official residence of the first two &lt;a href=\"Governor-General%20of%20the%20Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Governors-General&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Governor of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; resided in &lt;a href=\"Hillsborough%20Castle\"&gt;Hillsborough Castle&lt;/a&gt;, which is, since 1973, the official residence of the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland Secretary&lt;/a&gt;."
