    "text": "Hope Vale (also known as Hopevale) is a town within the &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Shire%20of%20Hope%20Vale\"&gt;Aboriginal Shire of Hope Vale&lt;/a&gt; and a coastal &lt;a href=\"Suburbs%20and%20localities%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;locality&lt;/a&gt; split between the Aboriginal Shire of Hope Vale and the &lt;a href=\"Shire%20of%20Cook\"&gt;Shire of Cook&lt;/a&gt;, both in &lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, Australia. It is an Aboriginal community. In the the locality of Hope Vale had a population of 1,015 people.\nGeography.\nHope Vale is on &lt;a href=\"Cape%20York%20Peninsula\"&gt;Cape York Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; about northwest of &lt;a href=\"Cooktown%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Cooktown&lt;/a&gt; by road, and about off the Battlecamp Road that leads to &lt;a href=\"Lakefield%20National%20Park\"&gt;Lakefield National Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Laura%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Laura&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Guugu%20Yimithirr%20language\"&gt;Guugu Yimithirr&lt;/a&gt; (also known as Koko Yindjir, Gugu Yimidhirr, Guguyimidjir) is an &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Aboriginal%20language\"&gt;Australian Aboriginal language&lt;/a&gt; of Hope Vale and the &lt;a href=\"Cooktown%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Cooktown&lt;/a&gt; area. The language region includes the local government area of the &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Shire%20of%20Hope%20Vale\"&gt;Aboriginal Shire of Hope Vale&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shire%20of%20Cook\"&gt;Shire of Cook&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the localities of &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Bedford%20Mission\"&gt;Cape Bedford&lt;/a&gt;, Battle Camp and sections of the &lt;a href=\"Normanby%20River\"&gt;Normanby River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Annan%20River\"&gt;Annan River&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Bedford%20Mission\"&gt;Cape Bedford Mission&lt;/a&gt; was established by &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Flierl\"&gt;Johann Flierl&lt;/a&gt;, a missionary of the &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; Church in 1886, with the settlement at &lt;a href=\"Elim%20Aboriginal%20Mission%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Elim&lt;/a&gt; on the beach.\nOwing to fears that the German-influenced Aboriginal people might cooperate with the advancing Japanese in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the total population of 286 was evacuated south to various communities by the military in May 1942. The German Lutheran missionaries were sent to &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s. Most of the people were sent to &lt;a href=\"Woorabinda%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Woorabinda&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Rockhampton%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Rockhampton&lt;/a&gt;, in Queensland, where a large number reportedly perished from disease and malnutrition. Hope Vale was re-established as a Lutheran &lt;a href=\"Mission%20%28Christian%29\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; in September 1949. Aboriginal people from the Hope Valley and Cape Bedford Missions settled there. A work crew was allowed to return in 1949 and the first families came home in 1950. \nHopevale Post Office opened on 1 May 1965 and closed in 1990.\nHopevale is no longer run as a mission by the &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; but by its own elected community council. In 1986 it received a \"deed of grant in trust\" (&lt;a href=\"DOGIT\"&gt;DOGIT&lt;/a&gt;) which \"granted title to 110,000 ha of land which was previously &lt;a href=\"Aboriginal%20Reserve\"&gt;Aboriginal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; Land held by the Under Secretary as trustee, to the community council to act as trustees of the land for the benefit of the residents.\" The Aboriginal Land Act 1991 (Qld) transferred into Indigenous ownership all previous reserve land under DOGIT (Deed of Grant in Trust) titles.\nHopevale is home to several clan groups who mostly speak &lt;a href=\"Guugu%20Yimidhirr%20language\"&gt;Guugu Yimidhirr&lt;/a&gt; and other related languages, as well as English.\nDue to a lack of reliable water supplies at &lt;a href=\"Elim%20Aboriginal%20Mission%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Elim&lt;/a&gt;, the community was shifted about inland to its present site.\nOn 21 July 2008 the Hope Vale community opened the Indigenous Knowledge and Technology Centre (IKTC), in the Jack Bambie building at 5 Muni Street. This centre provides a library service, training venue and public Internet access. The Hope Vale community has a strong choral singing tradition since its evacuation to Woorabinda. The ensemble has performed at the &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20Music%20Festival\"&gt;Queensland Music Festival&lt;/a&gt; on three occasions\u2014in 2005, 2007 and 2009.\nAt the , Hopevale had a population of 974 people.\nIn the the locality of Hope Vale had a population of 1,015 people.\nEducation.\nHope Vale has a primary (Prep-6) campus of Cape York Aboriginal Australian Academy, which is headquartered at the corner of Thiele and Poland Streets in &lt;a href=\"Cairns\"&gt;Cairns&lt;/a&gt; ().\nThere is no secondary school in Hope Vale. The nearest secondary school is Cooktown State School in neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Cooktown%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Cooktown&lt;/a&gt; to the south."
