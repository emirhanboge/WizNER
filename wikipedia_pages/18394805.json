    "text": "The Weaver\u2019s House is a unique example of the 18th-century &lt;a href=\"American%20Craftsman\"&gt;craftsman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;. Located in &lt;a href=\"Bielsko-Bia%C5%82a\"&gt;Bielsko-Bia\u0142a&lt;/a&gt;, it is situated in the Old Uptown in a &lt;a href=\"log%20cabin\"&gt;log cabin&lt;/a&gt; with its characteristic &lt;a href=\"hay\"&gt;hay&lt;/a&gt; store. The building is a museum branch belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20in%20Bielsko-Bia%C5%82a\"&gt;Museum in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe building functioned as a house and a &lt;a href=\"workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; until the beginnings of the 20th century. The information about its tenants is incomplete. In the second half of the 18th century it certainly was the Bartke family\u2019s and in the 19th century the Bathelts\u2019. From 1873 the owner of the building was Carl Nowak and after his death - Marie, the widow. At the beginning of the 20th century it belonged to the local &lt;a href=\"shoemaker\"&gt;shoemaker&lt;/a&gt;, Antoni Polo\u0144czyk After the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; the building became a &lt;a href=\"tenement%20house\"&gt;tenement house&lt;/a&gt; until Antoni\u2019s son, Wiktor Polo\u0144czyk, donated it to the &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; State in 1974 in order to establish a &lt;a href=\"museum\"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt; there. When in 1992 the long-lasting renovation works finished, the District Museum in &lt;a href=\"Bielsko-Bia%C5%82a\"&gt;Bielsko-Bia\u0142a&lt;/a&gt; opened the exhibition to the public.\nMuseum Exhibition.\nThe Museum exhibition presents the interiors of the house and the workshop belonging to a &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; master \u2013 the highest in rank guild representative. They show what it looked like at the turn of the 19th century, when the importance and greatness of the &lt;a href=\"handicraft\"&gt;handicraft&lt;/a&gt; (in terms of the &lt;a href=\"textile%20industry\"&gt;textile industry&lt;/a&gt;) lessened because of the sudden and rapid introduction of machines.\nThe hallway divides the building into two parts: the workshop on the left and the living area on the right. The workshop' is the largest room, containing objects connected with the weaver\u2019s work. The most impressive is the large harness loom dating back to the 18th century used for making wool textiles and there are also devices used for &lt;a href=\"Warp%20%28weaving%29\"&gt;warping&lt;/a&gt;. A part of this room was devoted for the office work which consisted in handling the guild matters and settling disputes between craftsmen. All documents, guild heirlooms and the iron coffer used as the guild strongbox are stored here. The workshop also served as an &lt;a href=\"apprentice\"&gt;apprentice&lt;/a&gt;'s bedroom, that is why there is some of his equipment next to the stove.\nFrom the workshop the hallway leads to the kitchen - the place of everyday family and social life. This room holds dishes, kitchen utensils and everyday use objects as well as objects connected with &lt;a href=\"weaving\"&gt;weaving&lt;/a&gt;. There is a small loom (19th century) and the visitors have a chance to see how it works. Besides you can see a &lt;a href=\"spinning%20wheel\"&gt;spinning wheel&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"reel\"&gt;reel&lt;/a&gt;.\nNext to the kitchen there is a bedroom and a sort of living room, used only on special occasions, whitewashed, arranged with &lt;a href=\"Wood%20veneer\"&gt;veneered&lt;/a&gt; furniture from the turn of the 19th century.\nAs a supplement to the exhibition on the display there are Jan Wa\u0142ach\u2019s &lt;a href=\"woodcut\"&gt;woodcut&lt;/a&gt;s presenting weavers at work."
