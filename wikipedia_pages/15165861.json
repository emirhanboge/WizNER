    "text": "WOHF (92.1 &lt;a href=\"FM%20broadcasting\"&gt;FM&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Wolf\") is an American &lt;a href=\"radio%20station\"&gt;radio station&lt;/a&gt; licensed to &lt;a href=\"Bellevue%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Bellevue, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, serving Ohio's &lt;a href=\"Vacationland%20%28Ohio%29\"&gt;Vacationland&lt;/a&gt; region, and featuring a &lt;a href=\"classic%20hits\"&gt;classic hits&lt;/a&gt; music format.\nThe station is an affiliate of &lt;a href=\"Cumulus%20Media\"&gt;Cumulus Media&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Greatest%20Mojo\"&gt;Classic Hits&lt;/a&gt; (formerly \"Pure Gold\" and \"Oldies Radio\") network. WOHF is part of the &lt;a href=\"Sandusky%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Sandusky, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; cluster of stations owned by BAS Broadcasting, and is located on North River Road in Fremont.\nFor many years, 92.1 FM was home to &lt;a href=\"contemporary%20hit%20radio\"&gt;CHR&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Top%2040\"&gt;Top 40&lt;/a&gt; station WNRR, known as \"92.1 The Hits.\" In October 2003, the station was sold to BAS Broadcasting, who changed the calls to WOHF and switched the station to ABC Radio's &lt;a href=\"The%20Classic%20Rock%20Experience\"&gt;The Classic Rock Experience&lt;/a&gt; format under the new moniker \"The Wolf.\" This put the station in competition with a number of other stations in the Ohio North Coast area broadcasting locally programmed classic rock formats, including &lt;a href=\"WXKR\"&gt;WXKR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"WMJK\"&gt;WMJK&lt;/a&gt;. In the summer of 2007, BAS switched WOHF from The Classic Rock Experience to Oldies Radio.\nIn 2011, WOHF became the Sandusky/Port Clinton affiliate of the &lt;a href=\"WSPD\"&gt;Rocket Sports Radio Network&lt;/a&gt;, broadcasting all &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Toledo\"&gt;University of Toledo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; games and selected men's &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; broadcasts, as well as the coach's shows for both sports. WOHF is also an affiliate of the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes\"&gt;Ohio State Buckeyes&lt;/a&gt; radio network, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20Radio%20Network\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers Radio Network&lt;/a&gt; (due to &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Roethlisberger\"&gt;Ben Roethlisberger&lt;/a&gt; being a native of nearby &lt;a href=\"Lima%2C%20OH\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt;).\nHistory.\nAs WNRR.\nWNRR signed on for the very first time on April 4, 1973 under the ownership of John P. Bedard of &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. Bellevue Mayor Phillus Robertson pressed the button to begin operation at 10:10\u00a0a.m. The station operated with 1,100 watts from studios at 106\u00bd East Main in Bellevue, Ohio, with the transmitting antenna located atop the studio building.\nThe original antenna stood 110 feet above average terrain, but was knocked down in February 1974 following a huge wind storm that struck Bellevue. A week later the station returned to the air at 500 watts and continued at that power until a few years later when it increased to 1,800 watts.\nFirst sale.\nIn 1978, the station's general manager, Robert Ladd, purchased the station from John P. Bedard for $78,000. Ladd had also been the chief advertising salesman and chief engineer since the station's inception.\nWNRR began operation as a Contemporary &lt;a href=\"Middle%20of%20the%20road%20%28music%29\"&gt;MOR&lt;/a&gt; (what would now be called &lt;a href=\"Hot%20AC\"&gt;Hot AC&lt;/a&gt;) station with four local on air personalities, Bob Ladd, Bill Wise, Kim Newsom and Jim Larvic. Micheal Shay and Bob Alue worked weekends. The station featured local newscasts each hour and National news from ABC FM Network (later NBC and finally CNN).\nDuring this time it was known as \"The Chicken\" in reference to its mascot, a giant whole broiled chicken dressed in seasonal clothing. Locally produced programs included a daily talk show called \"Talkback\" which evolved into one of radio's first self-help call-in shows hosted by Ladd and a daily sportscast with local newspaper sportswriter Ron Miller. High school football and basketball play by play was a mainstay, with Bellevue High School carried live and Clyde High tape delayed (the Clyde staff would not allow live broadcasts). In addition to music hosting, Ladd and Wise wrote and produced the local news. At one point the station operated with studios in both Bellevue and Clyde, Ohio. At one point the station carried games of the Cleveland Browns, Notre Dame and the Cincinnati Reds.\nWNRR went through several format changes including one to &lt;a href=\"Beautiful%20music\"&gt;Beautiful music&lt;/a&gt; around 1975 and later a year of &lt;a href=\"Country%20music\"&gt;Country&lt;/a&gt; before returning to Hot AC in the 1980s. Other personalities heard on WNRR included Ron Butcher, Steve Michaels (Real name: Stephen Eliot), Doctor Tim (Real name: Tim Errett), Steve Demarco, Arvin Forney, Mike Lawrence, Jeff Schlett and Rob Bultman The station became automated in the early 1990s in all dayparts except mornings where Ladd continued as morning host.\nIn September 1995 a fire was set by a disgruntled tenant in a rear apartment of the building housing the station. The subsequent water damaged forced the station off the air for two months until it relocated across the street. Although smoke covered, the tower and antenna were salvaged and placed on the new building. A transmitter being retired from &lt;a href=\"WMRN-FM\"&gt;WDIF&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Marion%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Marion, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; was purchased and the station returned to the air with 3,800 watts placing a highly improved signal over Sandusky and Norwalk, as well as Bellevue and Clyde.\nWhen WNRR returned to the air it became the first and only &lt;a href=\"Contemporary%20Hit%20Radio\"&gt;CHR&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Top%2040\"&gt;Top 40&lt;/a&gt; station in the Sandusky/&lt;a href=\"Port%20Clinton%2C%20OH\"&gt;Port Clinton&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Lake%20Erie%20Islands\"&gt;Lake Erie Islands&lt;/a&gt; region and began to see major success in ratings and acceptance by the Northern Ohio listeners. In 2000 the station broke new ground by organizing a top forty music concert at the State Theater in Sandusky, Ohio that attracted 2,100 attendees, only 1600 were allowed inside of the Theater, because the maximum capacity was reached. During this time the station was known as 92-1 The Hits.\nPreparing for retirement, Bob Ladd in 2001 relocated to &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20Florida\"&gt;Southwest Florida&lt;/a&gt; after hosting the longest running morning show in the four county area, 29 years total.\nGreg Michaels took over operation of WNRR and continued to manage the station for Ladd. Also, during this time period the station's ratings increased, showing it to be one of the top radio stations in the market, until it was sold to BAS in 2003.\nAs WOHF.\nUpon acquisition, BAS changed the call letters to WOHF, and adopted a classic rock, and later classic hits, format - all via satellite."
