    "text": "The Bardi Madonna or Madonna and Child with Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist is a 1480s tempera on panel painting by &lt;a href=\"Sandro%20Botticelli\"&gt;Sandro Botticelli&lt;/a&gt;, now in the &lt;a href=\"Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie%2C%20Berlin\"&gt;Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. Its primary name derives from the rich Florentine banker Agnolo Bardi who commissioned it for his family chapel at the &lt;a href=\"Santo%20Spirito%2C%20Florence\"&gt;Santo Spirito Basilica&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;. It was completed around the end of 1485.\nIt includes several symbols of Mary's virginity (the &lt;a href=\"hortus%20conclusus\"&gt;hortus conclusus&lt;/a&gt; in the background), purity (white lilies), her sinless state (the white flowers in the 'mystic vase' at the foot of her throne) and her status as a new &lt;a href=\"Venus%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Venus&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"myrtus%20communis\"&gt;myrtle&lt;/a&gt;). The red flowers in the vase also allude to Christ's Passion and to the two Johns' martyrdoms, whilst the olive and laurel branches refer to the mystery of the Incarnation.The ascetic character of the figure of Mary shows &lt;a href=\"Savonarola\"&gt;Savonarola&lt;/a&gt;'s influence on the artist."
