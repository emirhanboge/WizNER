    "text": "\u00c5mot Idrettsforening is a &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; multisports club located in &lt;a href=\"%C3%85mot%2C%20Buskerud\"&gt;\u00c5mot&lt;/a&gt;. It has sections for &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"handball\"&gt;handball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cross-country%20skiing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;cross-country skiing&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe football team being the most prominent, it played in the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; as late as &lt;a href=\"2007%20Norwegian%20Second%20Division\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, but for the next season its first team merged with others to become &lt;a href=\"Modum%20FK\"&gt;Modum FK&lt;/a&gt;. Hence, \u00c5mot's second team in the Fourth Division emerged as its new first team. In the 2008 season \u00c5mot was runner up in Fourth Division and was promoted to &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt;. \u00c5mot was relegated in &lt;a href=\"2009%20Norwegian%20Third%20Division\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;."
