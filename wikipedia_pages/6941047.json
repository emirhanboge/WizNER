    "text": "The Newcastle Rugby League is a local &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; football competition in &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%2C%20Australia\"&gt;Newcastle, Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the oldest rugby league competitions in Australia, founded in 1910. A &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Newcastle representative team&lt;/a&gt; was also assembled from players in the League during most of the 20th century. The first grade competition also comprises the &lt;a href=\"Presidents%20Cup%20%28Rugby%20League%29\"&gt;NSWRL Presidents Cup&lt;/a&gt; Northern Conference.\nHistory.\nA Newcastle team competed in the inaugural &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;New South Wales Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; premiership of 1908 but withdrew after the 1909 season to form the local competition.\nThe four original teams were Central Newcastle (Blue &amp; White), Northern Suburbs (Light &amp; Dark Blue vertical stripes), South Newcastle (Red &amp; White) and Western Suburbs (Red &amp; Green). The season kicked off 14 May 1910 with South playing West and Central playing Northern Suburbs. South Newcastle finished the season on top of the ladder; the final was played in front of 2500 spectators at Hamilton League Ground, with Central overcoming South 13\u20134.\nThe 1911 season saw the previous minor premiers South slump to the bottom of the ladder. The final was played in front of 4000 spectators and saw North victorious over Central 10\u20132.\n1911 saw the Combined Newcastle &amp; Hunter team Tour Queensland, defeating the &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Queensland State team&lt;/a&gt; in all matches played.\n&lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; played against the touring New Zealand team in a tight match almost pulling off an upset before going down 21\u201320.\nThe 1912 season saw the addition of Eastern Suburbs, playing in Black and White. They were immediately competitive and made the grand final.\nThe First World War saw a halt to the competition for 1917 and 1918. Although the Newcastle Morning Herald did continue to publish results for competition games for those two years.\n1919 saw a split, with two smaller competitions held \u2013 the \"Lilywhites\" or clubs faithful to the NSWRL, composed of Eastern Suburbs and Northern Suburbs, and the \"Bolsheviks\" or rebels composed of South, Central, North and West.\n1920 saw the competition reunited and expanded to six teams as &lt;a href=\"Kurri%20Kurri%20Bulldogs\"&gt;Kurri Kurri&lt;/a&gt; competed for the first time.\n2020 saw the competition cancelled for the first time in over one hundred years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With restrictions easing, a decision was made to implement a two tiered amateur competition. First Grade would feature Lakes United, Western Suburbs, Cessnock, Maitland, Central and Souths. Reserve Grade would see representation from Western Suburbs, Lakes United, Cessnock, Maitland, Central, Souths and Kurri Kurri. Of further note, Maitland also elected to participate in the Presidents Cup, spreading their resources across the two Newcastle competitions as well as the New South Wales based Presidents Cup, which they won. Cessnock defeated South Newcastle in the First Grade Grand Final.\nThe 2021 season featured the regular clubs, as well as both Wyong and The Entrance, forming a 10 team, 18 round competition. The Entrance will contest the competition for the first time in their history. As well as this, the Major Premiers also now advance to meet title winners from Illawarra, Ron Massey Cup and a wildcard in a conference style President's Cup at the end of the year. Unfortunately, the competition was interrupted by COVID-19 restrictions placed on the Hunter region, with a decision made to cancel the competition prior to any finals being played. Maitland Pickers had secured the Minor Premiership, but there would be no Major Premiers for season 2021. No President's Cup tournament was contested.\nPremiers.\nPast winners of the Newcastle RL Premiership\nTeam of the Century.\nIn 2008, rugby league football's centennial year in Australia, the Newcastle Rugby League named its 'Team of the Century':"
