    "text": "History.\nUnder Muhammad b. Ahmad b. Abu'l-Hussin b. Abu Sinan, the Uyunid's territory stretched from &lt;a href=\"Najd\"&gt;Najd&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20desert\"&gt;Syrian desert&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the influence of the Uyunid kingdom, &lt;a href=\"Al-Nasir\"&gt;Caliph al-Nasir li-Din Allah&lt;/a&gt; gave Muhammad b. Ahmad authority to protect the pilgrimage route to &lt;a href=\"Mecca\"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt;. Muhammad was later murdered by a family member, instigated by his cousin, Gharir b. Shukr b. Ali. In the years 587 \u2013 605 H. Mohammed bin Abi Al-hussain unites Qatif and Al-Hasa.\nGeography.\nThe country was mainly &lt;a href=\"Bahrain%20%28historical%20region%29\"&gt;Bahrain (historical region)&lt;/a&gt; in the east of the Arabian Peninsula. It stretched from the south of &lt;a href=\"Basra\"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=\"Persian%20Gulf\"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt; coast and included the regions of &lt;a href=\"Kuwait\"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Al-Ahsa%20Oasis\"&gt;al-Hasa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qatif\"&gt;Qatif&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qatar\"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Awal\"&gt;Awal&lt;/a&gt; Islands, now known as &lt;a href=\"Bahrain\"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UAE\"&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt; and to the edges of &lt;a href=\"Oman\"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt;. The Uyunid's territory stretched from Najd to the Syrian desert. Due to the influence of the Uyunid kingdom, Caliph al-Nasir li-Din Allah gave Muhammad b. Ahmad authority to protect the pilgrimage route to Mecca.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Uyunid%20dynasty\"&gt;Uyunid dynasty&lt;/a&gt; were an &lt;a href=\"Arab\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; dynasty that ruled Uyunid Emirate for almost 200 years, from the 11th to the 13th centuries. They were the remnants of Bani &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Qays\"&gt;Abdul Qays&lt;/a&gt; tribe and seized the country from the &lt;a href=\"Qarmatians\"&gt;Qarmatians&lt;/a&gt; with the military assistance of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seljuq%20Empire\"&gt;Great Seljuq Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the year 1077\u20131078 AD.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Uyunid%20dynasty\"&gt;Uyunid dynasty&lt;/a&gt; had a great Military system alongside the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seljuq%20Empire\"&gt;Great Seljuq Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomy.\nThe Uyunids Economy consisted of &lt;a href=\"pearl%20diving\"&gt;pearl diving&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"pearl\"&gt;pearl&lt;/a&gt; industry had been the main economic activity of Uyunid Emarite alongside the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20routes\"&gt;Trade routes&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemographics.\nIt was thought that the &lt;a href=\"Uyunid%20dynasty\"&gt;Uyunid dynasty&lt;/a&gt; were the last country in which the population spoke &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Arabic\"&gt;Classical Arabic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Uyunids sect is disputed; some sources mention they were Shia, others Sunni. According to Nakash, the populations of Bahrain, Hasa, and Qatif, may have accepted &lt;a href=\"Twelver%20Shi%27ism\"&gt;Twelver Shi'ism&lt;/a&gt; during this period. On the other hand, &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i historian &lt;a href=\"Safa%20Khulusi\"&gt;Safa Khulusi&lt;/a&gt; said they were Sunni. Over all the population living within the kingdom were mostly Muslim, however there are two different sect within the kingdom, &lt;a href=\"Sunni\"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shi%27a\"&gt;Shi'a&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\n&lt;a href=\"Ali%20bin%20al%20Mugrab%20Al%20Uyuni\"&gt;Ali bin al Mugrab Al Uyuni&lt;/a&gt;, a poet from &lt;a href=\"Al-Ahsa%20Oasis\"&gt;al-Hasa&lt;/a&gt;, died in 630 AH (1232 AD), one of the late known poets specialists hair systems eloquent among the people of the Arabian Peninsula before the modern era. Percentage due to Al Uyuni built from Abdul Qays, who ruled Ahsa in that period after extracted from Qarmatians. Al Uyuni poet, and is considered his office and explanations which are attached by one of the most important sources on the history of that state.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Khamis%20Mosque\"&gt;Khamis Mosque&lt;/a&gt; is believed to be the first mosque in &lt;a href=\"Bahrain\"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, built during the era of the &lt;a href=\"Umayyad\"&gt;Umayyad&lt;/a&gt; caliph &lt;a href=\"Umar%20II\"&gt;Umar II&lt;/a&gt;. According to \"&lt;a href=\"Al-Wasat%20%28Bahraini%20newspaper%29\"&gt;Al Wasat&lt;/a&gt;\" journalist Kassim Hussain, other sources mention that it was built in a later era during the rule of &lt;a href=\"Uyunid%20dynasty\"&gt;Uyunids&lt;/a&gt; with one &lt;a href=\"minaret\"&gt;minaret&lt;/a&gt;. The second was built two centuries later during the rule of &lt;a href=\"Usfurids\"&gt;Usfurids&lt;/a&gt;. The identical twin minarets of this ancient Islamic monument make it easily noticeable as one drives along the \"Shaikh Salman Road\" in &lt;a href=\"Khamis%2C%20Bahrain\"&gt;Khamis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is considered to be one of the oldest mosques in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;, as its foundation is believed to have been laid as early as 692 AD. An inscription found on the site, however, suggests a foundation date of sometime during the 11th century. It has since been rebuilt twice in both the 14th and 15th centuries, when the &lt;a href=\"minaret\"&gt;minaret&lt;/a&gt;s were constructed. The Khamis mosque has been partially restored recently."
