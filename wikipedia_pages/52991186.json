    "text": "Mount Erciyes (), also known as Argaeus, is a volcano in &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. It is a large &lt;a href=\"stratovolcano\"&gt;stratovolcano&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by many &lt;a href=\"Monogenetic%20volcanic%20field\"&gt;monogenetic vents&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava%20dome\"&gt;lava dome&lt;/a&gt;s, and one &lt;a href=\"maar\"&gt;maar&lt;/a&gt;. The bulk of the volcano is formed by &lt;a href=\"lava%20flows\"&gt;lava flows&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Andesite\"&gt;andesitic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dacite\"&gt;dacitic&lt;/a&gt; composition. At some time in the past, part of the summit collapsed towards the east.\nThe volcano began to form in the &lt;a href=\"Miocene\"&gt;Miocene&lt;/a&gt;. At first, a volcano farther east named formed from lava flows. Then, again to the east, large &lt;a href=\"explosive%20eruption\"&gt;explosive eruption&lt;/a&gt;s formed a &lt;a href=\"caldera\"&gt;caldera&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Pleistocene\"&gt;Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt;, Mount Erciyes proper grew inside the caldera together with a group of lava domes. Lateral eruptions of Erciyes may have generated ash layers in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; during the early &lt;a href=\"Holocene\"&gt;Holocene&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe last eruptions occurred during the early Holocene and may have deposited ash as far away as &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;; the occurrence of historical volcanism is uncertain. Future eruptions of Erciyes may endanger the nearby cities to the north. The volcano was &lt;a href=\"Glacier\"&gt;glaciated&lt;/a&gt; during the Pleistocene. One regular glacier still exists, but is receding.\nEtymology.\nErciyes was historically known as \"Argaeus\" or \"Argaios\", a name either derived from the king of &lt;a href=\"Macedon\"&gt;Macedon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Argaeus%20I\"&gt;Argaeus I&lt;/a&gt; (678640&lt;a href=\"Before%20Christ\"&gt;BC&lt;/a&gt;) or meaning \"bright\" or \"white\". &lt;a href=\"Mons%20Argaeus\"&gt;Mons Argaeus&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; was named after this old name for Erciyes. The older spelling of the name was \"Erciyas\" before it became \"Erciyes\" in the 1940s-1960s out of &lt;a href=\"vowel%20harmony\"&gt;vowel harmony&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeology and geomorphology.\nErciyes lies in the &lt;a href=\"Kayseri%20Province\"&gt;Kayseri Province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. The city of &lt;a href=\"Kayseri\"&gt;Kayseri&lt;/a&gt; lies - north of Erciyes volcano; some &lt;a href=\"lava%20dome\"&gt;lava dome&lt;/a&gt;s generated by the volcano are within the urban limits. Other towns in the region are &lt;a href=\"Talas%2C%20Turkey\"&gt;Talas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hac%C4%B1lar\"&gt;Hacilar&lt;/a&gt;, also north of Erciyes but closer to the volcano ( and , respectively), and &lt;a href=\"Develi\"&gt;Develi&lt;/a&gt;, located south of the volcano. Access to the summit area is difficult. Climbers in antiquity reported that both the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; could be seen from the summit.\nRegional.\nErciyes Dagi and &lt;a href=\"Hasan%20Dagi\"&gt;Hasan Dagi&lt;/a&gt; are both large &lt;a href=\"stratovolcano\"&gt;stratovolcano&lt;/a&gt;es that lie in Central Anatolia, on the Turkish &lt;a href=\"microplate\"&gt;microplate&lt;/a&gt;. This microplate is part of the collision zone between the &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20Plate\"&gt;Eurasian Plate&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"African%20Plate\"&gt;African Plate&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20Plate\"&gt;Arabian Plate&lt;/a&gt; that forms the &lt;a href=\"Alpide%20Belt\"&gt;Alpide Belt&lt;/a&gt;. This convergence commenced in the Miocene and formed the Anatolian block, with two oceans that existed between these three plates in the &lt;a href=\"Eocene\"&gt;Eocene&lt;/a&gt; disappearing through &lt;a href=\"subduction\"&gt;subduction&lt;/a&gt;. During the late Miocene, the &lt;a href=\"Neotethys\"&gt;Neo-Tethys&lt;/a&gt; ocean disappeared, and Africa and Eurasia collided. Later, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sea\"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Suez\"&gt;Gulf of Suez&lt;/a&gt; separated the Arabian Plate from the African Plate, causing the former to collide with Eurasia and forming the &lt;a href=\"Zagros%20fold%20and%20thrust%20belt\"&gt;Bitlis\u2013Zagros Belt&lt;/a&gt;. The Anatolian block was pushed westward between the &lt;a href=\"North%20Anatolian%20Fault\"&gt;North Anatolian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Anatolian%20Fault\"&gt;East Anatolian&lt;/a&gt; faults, and it is still moving today.\nIn central Anatolia, volcanism commenced in the Miocene. After an &lt;a href=\"effusive\"&gt;effusive&lt;/a&gt; phase and the eruption of large &lt;a href=\"ignimbrite\"&gt;ignimbrite&lt;/a&gt; sheets, volcanoes developed, including stratovolcanoes such as Erciyes Dagi and &lt;a href=\"Hasan%20Dagi\"&gt;Hasan Dagi&lt;/a&gt; on the one hand and &lt;a href=\"monogenetic%20volcano\"&gt;monogenetic volcano&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"maar\"&gt;maar&lt;/a&gt;s on the other hand. The tectonic environment has been compared with the &lt;a href=\"Basin%20and%20Range%20Province\"&gt;Basin and Range Province&lt;/a&gt;. The Central Anatolian Volcanic Province, of which Erciyes is a part, covers a surface area of . The Cappadocian volcanic plateau comprises ignimbrites that are up to thick. The youngest &lt;a href=\"Potassium%E2%80%93argon%20dating\"&gt;K\u2013Ar dates&lt;/a&gt; obtained on these centres are 60,000 \u00b1 20,000 years ago for the Kizirtepe monogenetic centres and 20,000 \u00b1 10,000 for Hasan. Volcanic activity in the &lt;a href=\"Ac%C4%B1g%C3%B6l-Nev%C5%9Fehir\"&gt;Ac\u0131g\u00f6l-Nev\u015fehir&lt;/a&gt; system has been &lt;a href=\"fission%20track%20dating\"&gt;fission track dated&lt;/a&gt; at 15,500 \u00b1 2,500 years ago.\nMajor &lt;a href=\"fault%20%28geology%29\"&gt;fault&lt;/a&gt;s such as the &lt;a href=\"North%20Anatolian%20Fault\"&gt;North Anatolian Fault&lt;/a&gt;, which were generated by the convergence, are also active. Some of these faults form the edges of the Erciyes pull-apart basin, a tectonic depression up to deep that is split by this volcano into the and basins, both of which nevertheless are part of the same system. These margin faults have been the source of earthquakes during historical times, resulting in damage to cities in the region, and ongoing extension of this crustal domain is the probable reason for volcanism at Erciyes.\nLocal.\nErciyes Dagi is a large stratovolcano, reaching a height of , or , making it the highest mountain and most voluminous volcano of Central Anatolia. It rises about above the basin and above the floor of the Erciyes pull-apart basin. \nThe volcano is large, it covers a surface area of or . It developed over a broad shield, and &lt;a href=\"dacitic\"&gt;dacitic&lt;/a&gt; domes and flows form the bulk of the volcano's exposed units, including the summit area, where several lava flows have been identified. Lava flows of Erciyes extend both from the summit and from lateral vents. A &lt;a href=\"debris%20avalanche\"&gt;debris avalanche&lt;/a&gt; extending east-northeast from Erciyes was formed by the collapse of the summit, creating a wide horseshoe-shaped scar that forms the upper segment of the valley. The debris avalanche deposit reaches a distance of from the summit and has a &lt;a href=\"hummock\"&gt;hummock&lt;/a&gt;y appearance. The volcano overall has an eroded appearance.\nTwo major valleys extend to the summit, the northwesterly Aksu Valley and the easterly valley. The minor valleys of lie north, south, and southwest of the summit. The Aksu valley contains sizable &lt;a href=\"moraine\"&gt;moraine&lt;/a&gt;s left by the Pleistocene glaciation that are up to high, wide and long. A &lt;a href=\"glacial%20outwash\"&gt;glacial outwash&lt;/a&gt; plain formed at the valley foot and was partly buried by lavas. Moraines and outwash plains are heavily eroded.\nAndesite and &lt;a href=\"basaltic%20andesite\"&gt;basaltic andesite&lt;/a&gt;s are exposed on the western, southern, and eastern sides of the volcano; on the eastern side they form the centre with a height of . This centre is mostly formed by &lt;a href=\"lava%20flow\"&gt;lava flow&lt;/a&gt;s. On the western side, andesitic lava flows reach the basin. The huge middle &lt;a href=\"Pleistocene\"&gt;Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt; Aliboran lava flow descended the western slopes and blocked the Incesu valley, forming Aliboran Lake in the basin. The lake was fed by glacial &lt;a href=\"meltwater\"&gt;meltwater&lt;/a&gt; from Erciyes and later overflowed the lava flow at several sites, the most important of which is . This overflow was not continuous; phases of lower lake levels caused it to dry up. Today, the basin contains &lt;a href=\"wetland\"&gt;wetland&lt;/a&gt;s that are protected under the &lt;a href=\"Ramsar%20Convention\"&gt;Ramsar Convention&lt;/a&gt; and are a major nesting site for &lt;a href=\"migratory%20bird\"&gt;migratory bird&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava%20dome\"&gt;Endogenous domes&lt;/a&gt; extend from Erciyes, and 184, 210, or 64 individual centres dot its flanks. The domes have diameters of , and formed along radial &lt;a href=\"Dyke%20%28geology%29\"&gt;dykes&lt;/a&gt;. A number of such domes and centres formed on the rim of the wide caldera in which Erciyes sits and which formed during the Valibaba Tepe eruption. This caldera may originally have had a volume of . Clockwise from north, these volcanic centres are , , , , , , , , , , , and . About half of these centres are at distances of about from Erciyes, and most of them can be found on the northern slopes. Of these centres, wide and deep lies northwest of Erciyes. It formed within &lt;a href=\"Quaternary\"&gt;Quaternary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt; lava flows; its formation was probably favoured by a shallow &lt;a href=\"aquifer\"&gt;aquifer&lt;/a&gt; and was accompanied by strong phreatomagmatic explosions. The formation of this maar was accompanied by the release of tephra, which reached a distance of . Additional &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt;ic vents are , , , and .\nFrom the more recent volcanic phases, and lava domes lie on the southern and northern slope of Erciyes, respectively. Both domes are formed of &lt;a href=\"rhyodacite\"&gt;rhyodacite&lt;/a&gt; and accompanied by &lt;a href=\"pyroclastic\"&gt;pyroclastic&lt;/a&gt; deposits. covers a surface area of and reaches a height of . The blocky dome flowed down the slopes southwards over . on the north-northwestern flank stratigraphically belongs to the same unit as . This dome flowed for a distance of about .\nThe volcano lies in a tectonic depression. It is cut by the fault, which together with the fault border this basin. Other faults converge on the volcano or pass through its outer slopes. &lt;a href=\"Aeromagnetic%20survey\"&gt;Aeromagnetic&lt;/a&gt; investigation of the region has evidenced the existence of a magnetic anomaly associated with Erciyes, which is probably caused by the volcanism.\nPetrology.\nErciyes Dagi has erupted basalt, basaltic andesite, andesite, &lt;a href=\"dacite\"&gt;dacite&lt;/a&gt;, rhyodacite, and &lt;a href=\"rhyolite\"&gt;rhyolite&lt;/a&gt;. The rocks are chiefly andesite with smaller amounts of dacite; dacites appear to dominate in the summit region, however. The volcano is dominated by &lt;a href=\"calc-alkaline\"&gt;calc-alkaline&lt;/a&gt; rocks; one basalt with &lt;a href=\"tholeiitic\"&gt;tholeiitic&lt;/a&gt; to intermediary affinity was erupted 1.7million years ago; volcanic activity at first was tholeiitic and later became calc-alkaline. Monogenetic volcanoes in the region also erupted basalt, but this basalt is clearly different from the Erciyes basalt.\nMinerals contained in Erciyes rocks include &lt;a href=\"clinopyroxene\"&gt;clinopyroxene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ilmenite\"&gt;ilmenite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orthopyroxene\"&gt;orthopyroxene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plagioclase\"&gt;plagioclase&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"titanomagnetite\"&gt;titanomagnetite&lt;/a&gt;. Samples taken from the summit also contain &lt;a href=\"amphibole\"&gt;amphibole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"apatite\"&gt;apatite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"biotite\"&gt;biotite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"feldspar\"&gt;feldspar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"quartz\"&gt;quartz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"zircon\"&gt;zircon&lt;/a&gt;. The mineral was first described from samples obtained on Mount Erciyes, and its chemical formula is \u00b7.\nThe dacites taken from the summit display a noticeable variability in their composition and texture, with their temperatures at formation varying between .\nThe andesites and dacites may have formed from basaltic &lt;a href=\"magma\"&gt;magma&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"fractional%20crystallization%20%28geology%29\"&gt;fractional crystallization&lt;/a&gt; involving amphibole, based on elemental composition data. Further, crustal materials were included into the magma. Tholeiitic and calc-alkaline magmas have different elemental compositions and probably formed from separate sources; tholeiitic magmas may have formed from partial melting of the mantle, while the calc-alkaline magmas formed from crustal assimilation in these magmas. Overall, the magma originated in the &lt;a href=\"Asthenosphere\"&gt;asthenospheric&lt;/a&gt; mantle; &lt;a href=\"lithospheric\"&gt;lithospheric&lt;/a&gt; components may have contributed, however.\nVolcanism appears to be associated with crustal extension at Erciyes. Mantle &lt;a href=\"metasomatism\"&gt;metasomatism&lt;/a&gt; from a subducting &lt;a href=\"slab%20%28geology%29\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, may or may not have played a major role, and the slab itself did not reach down below Central Anatolia, meaning that &lt;a href=\"subduction\"&gt;subduction&lt;/a&gt; probably is not responsible for Central Anatolian volcanism.\nClimate and biology.\nThe climate of the region is influenced by topography, with the &lt;a href=\"Taurus%20Mountains\"&gt;Taurus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ka%C3%A7kar%20Mountains\"&gt;Ka\u00e7kar Mountains&lt;/a&gt; blocking the entry of &lt;a href=\"moisture\"&gt;moisture&lt;/a&gt; into Anatolia. Summers are dry and hot and winters wet and cold; in Kayseri, summer temperatures are about and winter temperature about . Precipitation at Kayseri falls mostly in autumn, winter, and spring and amounts to per year. In Develi, south of Erciyes, maximum temperatures are about and minimum temperatures . Estimated temperatures at altitude are about , and precipitation per year. During the &lt;a href=\"last%20glacial%20maximum\"&gt;last glacial maximum&lt;/a&gt;, precipitation may have been double that of present-day.\nFour vegetation belts surround the mountain: a boreal belt, a subalpine, an alpine, and a subnival belt. The boreal belt extends between while the subalpine belt goes from elevation and the alpine from . Species found in the vegetation belts are different from these found in the equivalent areas of Western European mountains.\nThe &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; of Erciyes is diverse. A number of &lt;a href=\"endemic\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; plant species have been identified, including \"&lt;a href=\"Astragalus%20argaeus\"&gt;Astragalus argaeus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Astragalus%20stenosemioides\"&gt;Astragalus stenosemioides&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Asyneuma%20trichostegium\"&gt;Asyneuma trichostegium&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Bellardiochloa%20argaea\"&gt;Bellardiochloa argaea&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Dianthus%20crinitus\"&gt;Dianthus crinitus&lt;/a&gt; argaeus\", \"&lt;a href=\"Festuca%20cratericola\"&gt;Festuca cratericola&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Festuca%20woronowii\"&gt;Festuca woronowii&lt;/a&gt; argaea\", \"&lt;a href=\"Hieracium%20argaeum\"&gt;Hieracium argaeum&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Onobrychis%20argaea\"&gt;Onobrychis argaea&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Vicia%20canescens\"&gt;Vicia canescens&lt;/a&gt; argaea\". The plant \"&lt;a href=\"Silene\"&gt;Silene&lt;/a&gt; erciyesdaghensis\" was discovered on Erciyes and named after it. The geographer &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt; claimed that, in antiquity, the volcano was forested. A number of endemic and relic animal species can also be found at Erciyes, as well as a rich &lt;a href=\"lichen\"&gt;lichen&lt;/a&gt; flora. Grazing, settlements, and tourism have altered the natural vegetation of the mountain.\nGlaciation.\nThe volcano was glaciated during the Pleistocene, during which about three stages of glaciation occurred. &lt;a href=\"Ar%C3%AAte\"&gt;Aretes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cirque\"&gt;cirque&lt;/a&gt;s, horns, and moraines from these glaciations can be found on the volcano, with each of the five valleys that extend from the summit hosting glaciers. In the Aksu valley, these extended down to an altitude of . Glaciers reached lengths of ; with the Aksu valley glacier reaching a length of and the glacier of . The &lt;a href=\"snowline\"&gt;snowline&lt;/a&gt; was lower during the &lt;a href=\"last%20glacial%20maximum\"&gt;last glacial maximum&lt;/a&gt;, probably due to a wetter climate. &lt;a href=\"Chlorine-36\"&gt;Chlorine-36&lt;/a&gt; dating has yielded ages corresponding to the last glacial maximum and &lt;a href=\"Late%20Glacial\"&gt;late glacial&lt;/a&gt; for the principal moraines in Aksu valley. A late &lt;a href=\"Holocene\"&gt;Holocene&lt;/a&gt; glacial advance extended down to ; dating of these moraines has yielded ages of 1,200 \u00b1 300 years ago. In the valley, the lowermost moraines are found at an altitude of , with the late Holocene advance forming moraines at an altitude of . The maximum extent of glaciers on Erciyes occurred 21,300 \u00b1 900 years ago, when glaciers reached lengths of . Glacier retreat occurred 20,700 \u00b1 2,200 - 20,400 \u00b1 1,800 years ago in the two catchments. Smaller advances and retreats occurred 14,600 \u00b1 1,200 and 9,300 \u00b1 1,500 years ago. The glaciers expanded last 3,800 \u00b1 400 years ago; there is no clear evidence of a &lt;a href=\"Little%20Ice%20Age\"&gt;Little Ice Age&lt;/a&gt; glacier expansion. Later glacial advances mostly correspond to these estimated for other Mediterranean glaciers. Meltwater from these glaciers nourished a now-gone lake in the basin.\nDuring antiquity, the summit was always covered with snow. &lt;a href=\"Glacial\"&gt;Glacial&lt;/a&gt; ice is still found on the northwestern slope of Erciyes, in the Aksu Valley at altitudes of . It has a volume of about at a minimum. A report from 1905 says that the glacier was long. In 2009 the glacier was long and in 2011 an area of was reported; it is actively retreating and, assuming that the pace of retreat does not change, it will be gone by 2070. This is the westernmost glacier in Turkey today; other glaciers are found in the Ka\u00e7kar Mountains at the Black Sea, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Cilo\"&gt;Mount Cilo&lt;/a&gt; in southeastern Turkey, and on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Ararat\"&gt;Ararat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rock%20glacier\"&gt;Rock glacier&lt;/a&gt;s developed during the &lt;a href=\"Holocene\"&gt;Holocene&lt;/a&gt;, the valley hosts one with a surface area of .\nEruptive history.\nA number of &lt;a href=\"K%E2%80%93Ar%20dating\"&gt;potassium\u2013argon dates&lt;/a&gt; have been obtained for Erciyes Dagi, ranging from 2.59 \u00b1 0.1 million years ago to 80,000 \u00b1 10,000 years ago. Some stratigraphic units from Erciyes have been dated. Early volcanic activity occurred at the same time as the initial formation of the Erciyes basin. Since about 88,000 - 85,000 years ago, the average magma production rate has been about , with a long-term flux about four times larger.\nThe oldest volcanic activity at Erciyes is known as , which forms the eastern slope of Erciyes. This complex erupted &lt;a href=\"pyroxene\"&gt;pyroxene&lt;/a&gt; andesite, long &lt;a href=\"lava%20flow\"&gt;lava flow&lt;/a&gt;s from cone and &lt;a href=\"dense%20rock%20equivalent\"&gt;dense rock equivalent&lt;/a&gt; of fall deposits and &lt;a href=\"scoria\"&gt;scoria&lt;/a&gt; from . One date obtained on is 4.39 \u00b1 0.28 million years ago. Overall, was active between 4.4 and 2.9 million years ago.\nCaldera-forming activity occurred in several eruption phases, accompanied by pumice flows and ash fall. A first phase of activity formed Plinian deposits that reach thicknesses of as far as from the volcano, covering at least of surface. At least fifteen individual layers have been found. A second phase of activity formed pumice flows east-northeast of , covering to a thickness of .\nEastern &lt;a href=\"Cappadocia\"&gt;Cappadocia&lt;/a&gt; features the famous Cappadocian ignimbrites; one of these ignimbrites, the Valibaba Tepe ignimbrite (also known as ), was linked to Erciyes volcano and is the last Cappadocian ignimbrite. This eruption 2.8million years ago has a total volume of and was preceded by a smaller &lt;a href=\"Plinian%20eruption\"&gt;Plinian eruption&lt;/a&gt; that covered a surface of with pumice falls. The Valibaba Tepe ignimbrite extends east of the Erciyes volcano; it originated there and filled in the previous topography. Its total volume has been estimated at , and it contains a large proportion of &lt;a href=\"fiamme\"&gt;fiamme&lt;/a&gt;s. Changes in magma composition from the first phase of caldera-forming activity to the Valibaba Tepe pumice may reflect the emptying of a &lt;a href=\"magma%20chamber\"&gt;magma chamber&lt;/a&gt; with vertical composition gradient. The Valibaba Tepe ignimbrite was considered part of the famous Cappadocian ignimbrites, but is distinct from them insofar as the other ones (with the possible exception of the Taspinar-Dikmen ignimbrites of Hasan Dagi) are not associated with stratovolcanoes.\nErciyes volcano proper started developing 900,000 years ago. It was formed during two phases, starting with a basaltic andesite lava flow on the southern slope 1.7million years ago. It was followed by the andesitic lava flows on the western flank and then by many of the dacitic lava domes. Another phase of basaltic andesite activity followed, reaching lengths of . Effusive activity ended with small lava flows of varying composition.\nThe next phase of activity was explosive, with eruptions at the summit of Erciyes generating block-and-ash flows, pumice flows, and lava domes that formed blocks of in diameter. The deposits of this activity are found north and south of the summit of Erciyes and reach thicknesses of . is not precisely dated, but probably formed less than 100,000 years ago. The last dacitic eruption occurred 80,000 \u00b1 10,000 years ago at although later research has discovered later lavic eruptions. Activity in the summit region probably ended before the Holocene.\n&lt;a href=\"Radiometric%20dating\"&gt;Radiometric dating&lt;/a&gt; has yielded evidence of a major pulse of volcanic activity in the early &lt;a href=\"Holocene\"&gt;Holocene&lt;/a&gt;. , , and belong to the youngest stages of volcanic activity at Erciyes and formed on the rim of the former caldera. &lt;a href=\"Radiocarbon%20dating\"&gt;Radiocarbon&lt;/a&gt; and chlorine-36 dating of the deposits has yielded ages of 10,2009,700 years &lt;a href=\"before%20present\"&gt;before present&lt;/a&gt; for , while potassium\u2013argon dating yielded ages of 140,000 \u00b1 20,000110,000 \u00b1 30,000 years ago at first for all three. Radiocarbon dates of 9,9719,594 and 9,9849,596 years before present have been obtained for and , respectively. The three eruptions appear to have occurred within a short timeframe from each other. , a lava dome in Kayseri, is also of Holocene age, having been erupted 8,900 \u00b1 400 years ago.\nBefore extrusion of , a &lt;a href=\"Plinian\"&gt;Plinian&lt;/a&gt; fall deposit with base surges and pumice flows covered a surface of at a minimum. This was followed by a phreatomagmatic phase that deposited material up to thick, followed by another Plinian phase. The eruption was the strongest of the three lava dome forming eruptions and formed an &lt;a href=\"eruption%20column\"&gt;eruption column&lt;/a&gt; high, but it left the smallest crater of the three. This eruption at first formed a &lt;a href=\"tuff%20ring\"&gt;tuff ring&lt;/a&gt;, within which the lava dome was emplaced. Lava flows extend to lengths of . The dome and flow have a total volume of , and the eruption which had a &lt;a href=\"Volcano%20Explosivity%20Index\"&gt;Volcano Explosivity Index&lt;/a&gt; of 5 has been compared to that of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20St.%20Helens\"&gt;Mount St. Helens&lt;/a&gt; in North America. was extruded later on the northern flank. Another explosive phase, this time dominated by long pumice flows that contain &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; followed and generated the lava dome which is compositionally related to .\nThe last event was the collapse of the eastern flank of Ercyies. This collapse was probably triggered by an &lt;a href=\"earthquake\"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt;, considering that no evidence for a concomitant eruption exists. Considering the ages of the oldest moraines contained within the collapse scar, it probably happened more than 25,000 years ago. This collapse generated a debris avalanche long which dammed a lake and presently forms a hummocky deposit. The volume of rock removed by the collapse is about .\nA thick ash layer found in a drilling core off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; () was dated at 8,365 \u00b1 65 years ago in &lt;a href=\"Calibration%20of%20radiocarbon%20dates\"&gt;uncalibrated radiocarbon years&lt;/a&gt;. This tephra layer is known as the \"S1 tephra\" appears to be linked to one of these three eruptions on the basis of its composition, most likely the eruption, over away from the drilling core. A tephra layer named Tyam-1, found in in &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and dated at 8,600 \u00b1 850 years before present, is probably equivalent to this ash layer. Likewise, a thin tephra layer in the Sodmein Cave of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sea%20Mountains\"&gt;Red Sea Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, south of Erciyes, has been linked to the eruption, as was a layer in the former lake at &lt;a href=\"Tayma\"&gt;Tayma&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, away from Erciyes. Other tephras identified in the &lt;a href=\"Levantine%20Sea\"&gt;Levantine Sea&lt;/a&gt; and erupted between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago may also come from Erciyes. The eruptions that formed all these layers probably had profound effects on the affected Mediterranean cultures. Another tephra layer found in the Black Sea appears to come from either the or the eruptions. The tephra from these eruptions thus was probably spread northeastward, in contrast to the eruption, which spread tephra southeastward and thus is not found in the Black Sea. The unusual southward transport of the tephra may have occurred through low altitude winds.\nAndesites of less than 1,000 years of age have been identified. The occurrence of volcanic activity in historical times is not clear; &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt; (63 &lt;a href=\"Before%20Christ\"&gt;BC&lt;/a&gt;\u201321 &lt;a href=\"AD\"&gt;AD&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Claudius%20Claudianus\"&gt;Claudius Claudianus&lt;/a&gt; (370\u2013410 AD) report volcanic activity, and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20coin\"&gt;Roman coin&lt;/a&gt;s found in Cappadocia show the mountain smoking, but these reports may instead refer to swamp gas release in the basin and Strabo's reports appear to refer to fires in swamps. If volcanic activity occurred during historical times, it probably occurred on a &lt;a href=\"Parasitic%20vents\"&gt;parasitic vent&lt;/a&gt;, as the principal cone is heavily eroded.\nThreats and human interaction.\nErciyes Dagi volcano has manifested &lt;a href=\"explosive%20eruption\"&gt;explosive eruption&lt;/a&gt;s preceding the formation of lava domes. Such eruptions may endanger the cities of Kayseri, Hacilar, and Talas. Melting of the remnant ice on the volcano may generate dangerous &lt;a href=\"lahar\"&gt;lahar&lt;/a&gt;s; in 1985 an eruption of &lt;a href=\"Nevado%20del%20Ruiz\"&gt;Nevado del Ruiz&lt;/a&gt; volcano in &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Armero%20tragedy\"&gt;claimed 20,000 fatalities&lt;/a&gt; after such a mudflow. Even without an eruption, strong rainfall could form mudflows on the densely populated steep slopes of the volcano. The volcano is monitored with &lt;a href=\"seismometer\"&gt;seismometer&lt;/a&gt;s and its deformation has been measured.\nThe ancient &lt;a href=\"Hittites\"&gt;Hittites&lt;/a&gt; left rock carvings and even an artificial tunnel on Mount Erciyes. Presently, about five hotels exist at the mountain, which is a major &lt;a href=\"winter%20sports\"&gt;winter sports&lt;/a&gt; site. In 2010, 324,221 &lt;a href=\"tourists\"&gt;tourists&lt;/a&gt; visited the mountain and Kayseri, most of them domestic tourists. A ski centre, &lt;a href=\"Erciyes%20Ski%20Resort\"&gt;Erciyes Ski Resort&lt;/a&gt;, exists on Erciyes. The resort lies at an altitude of at the valley."
