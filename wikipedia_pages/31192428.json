    "text": "The Way of the Roses is the newest of Great Britain's coast-to-coast, long-distance cycle routes and is based on minor roads, disused railway lines and specially constructed &lt;a href=\"cycle%20path\"&gt;cycle path&lt;/a&gt;s. It lies entirely within the counties of &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, crossing the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Dales\"&gt;Yorkshire Dales&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Wolds\"&gt;Yorkshire Wolds&lt;/a&gt; in the north of England, passing through the historic cities of &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt; and scenic towns and villages including &lt;a href=\"Settle%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Settle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pateley%20Bridge\"&gt;Pateley Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ripon\"&gt;Ripon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt long, the route is designed for the whole range of cyclists, from families to &lt;a href=\"cycling%20club\"&gt;cycling club&lt;/a&gt; riders. Although a challenge with some hard climbs\u2014the highest point being over \u2014the route is steadily increasing in popularity. The route is fully open and signed.\nThe route is named after the &lt;a href=\"Wars%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;Wars of the Roses&lt;/a&gt;, a 15th-century war between the English dynastic families &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe route was developed by &lt;a href=\"Sustrans\"&gt;Sustrans&lt;/a&gt; and part of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Network\"&gt;National Cycle Network&lt;/a&gt; (NCN Route 69) in partnership with various &lt;a href=\"Local%20Authorities\"&gt;Local Authorities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%20City%20Council\"&gt;Lancaster City Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyclists%20Touring%20Club\"&gt;Cyclists Touring Club&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bridlington%20Renaissance%20Partnership\"&gt;Bridlington Renaissance Partnership&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Welcome%20to%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Welcome to Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; amongst others. The route was opened in 2010 running from &lt;a href=\"Morecambe\"&gt;Morecambe&lt;/a&gt; on the west coast of &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; to the east coast at &lt;a href=\"Bridlington\"&gt;Bridlington&lt;/a&gt;. A second diversion between Pateley Bridge and York that goes via Harrogate and Knaresborough was opened in 2011. Additionally, there is a section that links &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20upon%20Hull\"&gt;Kingston upon Hull&lt;/a&gt; to the cycle route that joins/leaves near &lt;a href=\"Pocklington\"&gt;Pocklington&lt;/a&gt; rather than going to/from Bridlington.\nArt.\nA number of public artworks have been commissioned for the route. &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Baker%20%28British%20artist%29\"&gt;Matt Baker&lt;/a&gt; is currently developing a series of linked artworks at various points along the route. This work has not yet been completed.\nRoute.\nThe route is well signposted with signs carrying the name of the route or marked with the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rose%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"White%20Rose%20of%20York\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"heraldry\"&gt;heraldic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rose\"&gt;rose&lt;/a&gt;s from which the name of the route is derived.\nThe route starts in the resort town of Morecambe, Lancashire loosely following the &lt;a href=\"River%20Lune\"&gt;River Lune&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"River%20Wenning\"&gt;River Wenning&lt;/a&gt; into the Pennines at Settle and entering the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Dales%20National%20Park\"&gt;Yorkshire Dales National Park&lt;/a&gt;. From there it makes its steepest climb (eastwards) across the edge of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20peaks%20in%20the%20Yorkshire%20Dales\"&gt;Rye Loaf Hill&lt;/a&gt; before descending to &lt;a href=\"Airton\"&gt;Airton&lt;/a&gt;. Thence it heads northeast to &lt;a href=\"Grassington\"&gt;Grassington&lt;/a&gt; before following the &lt;a href=\"River%20Wharfe\"&gt;River Wharfe&lt;/a&gt; for several miles and then turning towards the high point of the route at &lt;a href=\"Greenhow\"&gt;Greenhow&lt;/a&gt; and descending to &lt;a href=\"Pateley%20Bridge\"&gt;Pateley Bridge&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Nidd\"&gt;River Nidd&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond Pateley Bridge the hills are significantly lower and after Ripon (with a short exception of the Yorkshire Wolds) the route is more or less flat, passing through York before finally reaching Bridlington and the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The route is made up primarily of:\nThe Way Of The Roses is best ridden from west to east to take advantage of the &lt;a href=\"prevailing%20winds\"&gt;prevailing winds&lt;/a&gt; from the West and the more favourable gradients. Tradition dictates that you start the ride by dipping your back wheel in the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Sea\"&gt;Irish Sea&lt;/a&gt; and only ends when your front wheel gets a dip in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; at the finish. It is typically completed in 3\u20135 days.\nRelated NCN Routes.\nThe Way of the Roses makes use of 8 National Cycle Network routes. Starting in Morecambe on &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%2069\"&gt;Route 69&lt;/a&gt;. It transfers to &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%2068\"&gt;Route 68&lt;/a&gt; at Clapham on to &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%20688\"&gt;Route 688&lt;/a&gt; at Winterburn and &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%2065\"&gt;Route 65&lt;/a&gt; at Linton-on-Ouse Through central York it follows the short &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%20658\"&gt;Route 658&lt;/a&gt; before joining &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%2066\"&gt;Route 66&lt;/a&gt; At Pockington it takes &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%20164\"&gt;Route 164&lt;/a&gt; over the Yorkshire Wolds before picking up &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%201\"&gt;Route 1&lt;/a&gt; near Hutton Cranswick which it then uses to the finish in Bridlington.\nThe route links to other parts of the NCN so can be used as part of a longer &lt;a href=\"Bicycle%20touring\"&gt;cycle tour&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the above listed routes the way of the Roses has junctions with &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%20700\"&gt;Route 700&lt;/a&gt; at Morecambe &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%206\"&gt;Route 6&lt;/a&gt; at Lancaster &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%2067\"&gt;Route 67&lt;/a&gt; near Fountains Abbey and &lt;a href=\"National%20Cycle%20Route%20167\"&gt;Route 167&lt;/a&gt; at Huggate in the Yorkshire Wolds\nRoute maps for The Way Of The Roses and detailed route guides from other publishers are available from &lt;a href=\"Sustrans\"&gt;Sustrans&lt;/a&gt;."
