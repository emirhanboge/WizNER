    "text": "Horsham St Faith is a village in &lt;a href=\"Norfolk\"&gt;Norfolk&lt;/a&gt;, England. The village lies close and to the east of the &lt;a href=\"A140%20road\"&gt;A140 road&lt;/a&gt; and is north of Norwich and some south of &lt;a href=\"Aylsham\"&gt;Aylsham&lt;/a&gt; It takes its name from the &lt;a href=\"River%20Hor\"&gt;River Hor&lt;/a&gt;, which runs through it on its way from Horsford to Horstead; and a &lt;a href=\"Benedictine\"&gt;Benedictine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horsham%20St.%20Faith%20Priory\"&gt;priory&lt;/a&gt;, founded in honour of &lt;a href=\"St%20Faith\"&gt;St Faith&lt;/a&gt; that, until the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries\"&gt;dissolution of the monasteries&lt;/a&gt;, stood there. It is near &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Norwich International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, which began in 1939 as &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Horsham%20St%20Faith\"&gt;RAF Horsham St Faith&lt;/a&gt; and home of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Norwich%20Aviation%20Museum\"&gt;City of Norwich Aviation Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Administratively it is in the &lt;a href=\"civil%20parish\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Horsham%20St%20Faith%20and%20Newton%20St%20Faith\"&gt;Horsham St Faith and Newton St Faith&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Non-metropolitan%20district\"&gt;district&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Broadland\"&gt;Broadland&lt;/a&gt;. It also forms part the wider &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20Built-up%20area\"&gt;Norwich Built-up area&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name 'Horsham' means 'horse homestead/village'.\nIt has the remains of a &lt;a href=\"Horsford%20Castle\"&gt;Horsford Castle&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"motte%20and%20bailey\"&gt;motte and bailey&lt;/a&gt; castle, on the Horsford side of the &lt;a href=\"A140%20road\"&gt;A140 road&lt;/a&gt;, reached by following a track to the north of Church Street, which joins &lt;a href=\"Horsford\"&gt;Horsford&lt;/a&gt; and Horsham St Faith.\nOn 17 October from the early 12th century until 1872 it played host to one of the country's largest cattle fairs. This fair was held to the south of Spixworth Road around Bullock Hill and Calf Lane.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Manor House and the land that in 1939 became RAF Horsham St Faith, was owned by John Thomas &lt;a href=\"Spurrell\"&gt;Spurrell&lt;/a&gt;, youngest son of Richard James Spurrell, of &lt;a href=\"Thurgarton%20%28Norfolk%29\"&gt;Thurgarton&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the church at Horsham St Faith there is a memorial to his eldest son, John Francis Brabazon Spurrell, who was killed by &lt;a href=\"African%20Buffalo\"&gt;buffalo&lt;/a&gt; at Kibaya, &lt;a href=\"Tanganyika%20%28territory%29\"&gt;Tanganyika&lt;/a&gt;, in 1927.\nThe Church of St Mary and St Andrew.\nThe present day church dates back to the 13th century and has undergone many changes. Much of the building was restored in 1873 with a \u00a31400 donation from the &lt;a href=\"Twinings\"&gt;Twinings&lt;/a&gt; tea family. Of interest inside the church is the &lt;a href=\"rood%20screen\"&gt;rood screen&lt;/a&gt; dated 1528 and adorned with 12 panels depicting saints. Also, of note is the elaborate &lt;a href=\"Jacobean%20architecture\"&gt;Jacobean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"baptismal%20font\"&gt;font&lt;/a&gt; cover.\nThe pulpit is also of note, with painted panels recently restored by the V &amp; A Museum.\nThe use of the church is shared with the Methodists.\nNotes.\nhttp://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Norfolk/Horsham%20St.%20Faith%20with%20Newton%20St.%20Faith"
