    "text": "The Michigan State Spartans, officially branded as the Michigan State Spartans presented by Rocket Mortgage for sponsorship reasons, are the athletic teams that represent &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20State%20University\"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt;. The school's athletic program includes 23 &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20team\"&gt;varsity&lt;/a&gt; sports teams. Their mascot is a &lt;a href=\"Spartan%20Army\"&gt;Spartan&lt;/a&gt; warrior named &lt;a href=\"Sparty\"&gt;Sparty&lt;/a&gt;, and the school colors are green and white. The university participates in the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;NCAA's Division I&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20Football%20Bowl%20Subdivision\"&gt;Football Bowl Subdivision&lt;/a&gt; for football. The Spartans participate as members of the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference\"&gt;Big Ten Conference&lt;/a&gt; in all varsity sports. Michigan State offers 11 varsity sports for men and 12 for women.\nMSU's &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team has won or shared six national championships in 1951, 1952, 1955, 1957, 1965 and 1966, and has won the &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Bowl%20Game\"&gt;Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in 1954, 1956, 1988 and 2014. Its &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;men's basketball&lt;/a&gt; team won the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship\"&gt;NCAA National Championship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1979%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2000%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;. The MSU &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;men's ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; team won &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championship\"&gt;national titles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1966%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;1966&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1986%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2007%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Ice%20Hockey%20Tournament\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn 1925, the institution changed its name to \"Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science\", and, as an agricultural school, its teams were referred to as the Aggies. Looking to move beyond its agricultural roots, Michigan State held a contest to find a new nickname. They had decided to call the teams the \"Michigan Staters\". George S. Alderton, a local sports writer for the \"&lt;a href=\"Lansing%20State%20Journal\"&gt;Lansing State Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" decided the name was too cumbersome and went through the entries to find a better and more heroic name. He decided on the \"&lt;a href=\"Spartan%20Army\"&gt;Spartans&lt;/a&gt;\", but sadly forgot to write down who submitted the suggestion.\nWith a heroic name, the \"Spartans\" quickly caught on as the teams' new nickname. They later changed the lyrics of the &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20State%20University%20Fight%20Song\"&gt;Fight Song&lt;/a&gt; to reflect the name change of the College and its sports teams.\nAs the college grew, it looked to join a major collegiate conference. When the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt; eliminated varsity &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and withdrew from the Western Conference (now the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference\"&gt;Big Ten&lt;/a&gt;) in 1946, Michigan State president &lt;a href=\"John%20A.%20Hannah\"&gt;John A. Hannah&lt;/a&gt; lobbied to take its place. Despite opposition from the University of Michigan, the Big Ten admitted M.S.C. on May 20, 1949. After joining the conference, head &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href=\"Biggie%20Munn\"&gt;Clarence L. \"Biggie\" Munn&lt;/a&gt; led the Spartan football team to the &lt;a href=\"Rose%20Bowl%20Game\"&gt;Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in the 1953\u201354 season, beating &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; 28\u201320. Successor coach &lt;a href=\"Duffy%20Daugherty\"&gt;Hugh \"Duffy\" Daugherty&lt;/a&gt; carried the football team to a second Rose Bowl where it again defeated UCLA, 17\u201314.\nSports sponsored.\nMichigan State has 21 &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; Division I-A &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20team\"&gt;varsity&lt;/a&gt; teams: 10 varsity sports for men and 11 for women. They participate in the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference\"&gt;Big Ten Conference&lt;/a&gt; except fencing, where until 1997, from the University founding, MSU featured fencing as a varsity sport. During that time, MSU was coached by the first American recognized as a master of fencing, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Schmitter\"&gt;Charles Schmitter&lt;/a&gt;, for 45 years, from 1939 to 1984. Upon his retirement, his student, Fred Freiheit, coached from 1984 until fencing was demoted from varsity status in 1997. The Michigan State University Fencing Club is a competing member of the Midwest Fencing Conference, which consists of sixteen (16) schools with varsity or club programs.\nBasketball.\nMen's basketball.\nMichigan State's men's basketball team has won the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship\"&gt;National Championship&lt;/a&gt; two times: in &lt;a href=\"1979%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2000%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1978%E2%80%9379%20Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball%20team\"&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Johnson\"&gt;Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Kelser\"&gt;Greg Kelser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Vincent\"&gt;Jay Vincent&lt;/a&gt; and Mike Brkovich, carried the MSU team to a 75\u201364 win against the &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Bird\"&gt;Larry Bird&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href=\"1978%E2%80%9379%20Indiana%20State%20Sycamores%20men%27s%20basketball%20team\"&gt;Indiana State&lt;/a&gt; Sycamores. In &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball%20team\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;, three players from &lt;a href=\"Flint%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Flint, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morris%20Peterson\"&gt;Morris Peterson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Bell%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Charlie Bell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mateen%20Cleaves\"&gt;Mateen Cleaves&lt;/a&gt;, carried the team to its second national title. Dubbed the \"&lt;a href=\"Flintstones%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Flintstones&lt;/a&gt;\", they were the key to the Spartans' win against &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20Florida%20Gators%20men%27s%20basketball%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; 89\u201376. In addition to the two Championships, the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball%20team\"&gt;2008\u201309 team&lt;/a&gt; reached the &lt;a href=\"2009%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;NCAA Championship&lt;/a&gt; game, but lost to &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20men%27s%20basketball%20team\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; 89\u201372.\nSince 1995, Michigan State has been coached by &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Izzo\"&gt;Tom Izzo&lt;/a&gt;, who has a 606\u2013231 record through April 5, 2019. Izzo's coaching helped the team make six of twelve NCAA &lt;a href=\"Final%20Four\"&gt;Final Four&lt;/a&gt;s from 1999 to 2010, winning the title in 2000 and leading ESPN to define MSU as the best team in that decade. Michigan State basketball has been selected for 22 consecutive NCAA tournament bids under Izzo. The Spartans have won one NCAA Championship, nine Big Ten Regular Season Championships, and six &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;Big Ten Tournament&lt;/a&gt; Championships (the most of any team in the Big Ten) under Izzo. The team has made two NCAA Championship games and advanced to eight Final Fours, 10 Elite Eights, and 14 Sweet Sixteens under Izzo.\nOverall, Michigan State has won two NCAA Championships, 15 Big Ten Regular Season Championships, and six Big Ten Tournament Championships. The Spartans have appeared in three NCAA Championship games, 10 Final Fours, 14 Elite Eights, 20 Sweet Sixteens, and made 30 NCAA Tournament appearances.\nSpartans formerly or currently in the NBA include &lt;a href=\"Adreian%20Payne\"&gt;Adreian Payne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deyonta%20Davis\"&gt;Deyonta Davis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bryn%20Forbes\"&gt;Bryn Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denzel%20Valentine\"&gt;Denzel Valentine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Ager\"&gt;Maurice Ager&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Anderson%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Alan Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Bell%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Charlie Bell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shannon%20Brown\"&gt;Shannon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mateen%20Cleaves\"&gt;Mateen Cleaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Davis%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Paul Davis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Furlow\"&gt;Terry Furlow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Feick\"&gt;Jamie Feick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draymond%20Green\"&gt;Draymond Green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Green%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Johnny Green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Harris\"&gt;Gary Harris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Johnson\"&gt;Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Kelser\"&gt;Greg Kelser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Peplowski\"&gt;Mike Peplowski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morris%20Peterson\"&gt;Morris Peterson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zach%20Randolph\"&gt;Zach Randolph&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shawn%20Respert\"&gt;Shawn Respert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Richardson\"&gt;Jason Richardson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Skiles\"&gt;Scott Skiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Smith%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Steve Smith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Snow\"&gt;Eric Snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Vincent%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Sam Vincent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Vincent\"&gt;Jay Vincent&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Willis\"&gt;Kevin Willis&lt;/a&gt;.\nWomen's basketball.\nMSU also has a fairly successful women's basketball team, with its greatest accomplishment being a national runner-up finish to &lt;a href=\"Baylor%20Lady%20Bears%20basketball\"&gt;Baylor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2005%20NCAA%20Women%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;. MSU's women's basketball started in 1972\u201373 under coach Mikki Baile. The women's team has had five coaches in its history. The Spartans current coach is &lt;a href=\"Suzy%20Merchant\"&gt;Suzy Merchant&lt;/a&gt;. The Spartans have made one National Championship game, one Final Four, one Elite Eight, three Sweet Sixteens, and appeared in 15 NCAA/AIAW Tournaments.\nFootball.\n&lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;Football&lt;/a&gt; has a long tradition at Michigan State. Starting as a club sport in 1884, football gained varsity status in 1896. During that time, the Spartans had a roster of impressive players, including Lynn Chandnois, Dorne Dibble, Meredith Assaly, and Don McAulliffe. In 1951, the Spartans finished the season undefeated, and performed the same feat the following year in addition to the nation's longest winning streak of 24 games. The team was named the \"undisputed national champions by every official poll\".\nAfter waiting for several years, the team was finally admitted into the Big Ten Conference as a regular member in 1953. They promptly went on to capture the league championship (losing only one game during the season) and beating UCLA in their first &lt;a href=\"1954%20Rose%20Bowl\"&gt;Rose Bowl game&lt;/a&gt;. After the 1953 season &lt;a href=\"Biggie%20Munn\"&gt;Biggie Munn&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary Spartan coach, turned the team over to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and future legend &lt;a href=\"Duffy%20Daugherty\"&gt;Duffy Daugherty&lt;/a&gt;. Daughtery went on to win the &lt;a href=\"1956%20Rose%20Bowl\"&gt;1956 Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. George Perles was the head coach when the Spartans defeated USC in the &lt;a href=\"1988%20Rose%20Bowl\"&gt;1988 Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe current coach is &lt;a href=\"Mel%20Tucker\"&gt;Mel Tucker&lt;/a&gt;, who was hired on February 12, 2020. His predecessor &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Dantonio\"&gt;Mark Dantonio&lt;/a&gt; amassed a 114\u201357 record in his &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20football\"&gt;coaching tenure&lt;/a&gt; before his retirement on February 4, 2020.\nUnder Dantonio, MSU has won three Conference Championships, &lt;a href=\"2010%20Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20football%20team\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2013%20Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20football%20team\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"2015%20Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20football%20team\"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;. The Spartans have won three Big Ten Divisional championships and two &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Football%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;Big Ten Championship games&lt;/a&gt; during that period. In 2015, MSU was selected for the &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Playoff\"&gt;College Football Playoff&lt;/a&gt; as the No. 3 seed, but lost to &lt;a href=\"2015%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Cotton%20Bowl%20Classic%20%28December%29\"&gt;Cotton Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. He also led the Spartans to a victory in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Rose%20Bowl\"&gt;2014 Rose Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, the 100th edition of the \"Grandaddy of them all.\"\nAll told, Michigan State has won six national championships and nine Big Ten championships.\nToday, the football team competes in &lt;a href=\"Spartan%20Stadium%2C%20East%20Lansing\"&gt;Spartan Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, a renovated 75,005-person football stadium in the center of campus.\nMSU's traditional archrival is &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Wolverines%20football\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, against whom they compete for the &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Bunyan%20Trophy\"&gt;Paul Bunyan Trophy&lt;/a&gt;; MSU has a 23\u201334\u20131 record in the annual trophy game. The Spartans have won the trophy seven of the past eight years, as of 2015 season.\nMichigan State's rivalry game against &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Notre%20Dame\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;, with whom they compete for the &lt;a href=\"Megaphone%20Trophy\"&gt;Megaphone Trophy&lt;/a&gt; was played every year until 2013. MSU's record in the trophy series against the Fighting Irish is 26\u201334\u20131.\nNotable MSU alumni who have played in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href=\"Morten%20Andersen\"&gt;Morten Andersen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plaxico%20Burress\"&gt;Plaxico Burress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andre%20Rison\"&gt;Andre Rison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20Mason\"&gt;Derrick Mason&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muhsin%20Muhammad\"&gt;Muhsin Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"T.%20J.%20Duckett\"&gt;T.

Between World War I and World War II, Michigan State College competed in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Collegiate%20Conference\"&gt;Central Collegiate Conference&lt;/a&gt;, winning titles in 1926\u20131929, 1932, 1933 and 1935. Michigan State also experienced success in the &lt;a href=\"IC4A\"&gt;IC4A&lt;/a&gt;, at New York's &lt;a href=\"Van%20Cortlandt%20Park\"&gt;Van Cortlandt Park&lt;/a&gt;, winning 15 team titles (1933\u20131937, 1949, 1953, 1956\u20131960, 1962, 1963 and 1968). Since entering the Big Ten in 1950, Michigan State has won 14 men's titles (1951\u20131953, 1955\u20131960, 1962, 1963, 1968, 1970 and 1971). Michigan State hosted the inaugural NCAA cross country championships in 1938 and every year thereafter through 1964 (except a one-year vacation in 1943 due to war). The Spartans won eight NCAA championships from 1930 to 1959, including 1939, 1948, 1949, 1952, and 1955\u20131959 (minus 1957). Walt Drenth is the current director of both the men's and women's cross country and &lt;a href=\"track%20%26amp%3B%20field\"&gt;track and field&lt;/a&gt; programs. After joining MSU in 2004, Drenth led the men's cross country team to an NCAA Championship bid during the 2004 season. The women's cross country team also advanced to the NCAA Championship Meet after winning the Great Lakes Regional race.\nIce hockey.\nMichigan State has two varsity &lt;a href=\"hockey\"&gt;hockey&lt;/a&gt; teams: a men's &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; team and a women's &lt;a href=\"field%20hockey\"&gt;field hockey&lt;/a&gt; team.

(&lt;a href=\"Carol%20Hutchins\"&gt;Carol Hutchins&lt;/a&gt; played shortstop for that 1976 team, and would coach the Wolverines to the title 29 years later.) The team has appeared in six &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20College%20World%20Series\"&gt;Women's College World Series&lt;/a&gt;, in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1981.

Since taking over the program, Joseph has helped bring MSU to a record of 668\u2013677\u20131 and four NCAA Regional appearances.\nWrestling.\nWrestling was one of the earliest sports formed at the &lt;a href=\"Michigan%20Agricultural%20College\"&gt;Michigan Agricultural College&lt;/a&gt;. While the sport was dropped in 1906, it was reformed by the college 16 years later in 1922. The school's &lt;a href=\"collegiate%20wrestling\"&gt;wrestling&lt;/a&gt; team has won the NCAA Division I championship once, in 1967.

Maynard is a former two-time UFC Lightweight Title challenger and Evans is a former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion.\nStarting in the mid-2000s, the Spartan wrestling team started to decline. From 2004\u20132016, the team had one season better than .500 and finished in the bottom half of the Big Ten, including last on four occasions. During the 2015 championship tournament, the team finished dead last with negative team points (\u22120.5) thanks to only one qualifier and an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Minkel announced that he would retire after the 2015\u201316 season.\nMichigan State University Spartan wrestling team accomplishments:\nOther varsity sports.\nMSU has a number of other team sports. As in many other &lt;a href=\"NCAA\"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; institutions, Michigan State has a &lt;a href=\"college%20baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; team for men and a &lt;a href=\"college%20softball\"&gt;softball&lt;/a&gt; team for women. &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Boss%20Jr.\"&gt;Jake Boss Jr.&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"head%20coach\"&gt;head coach&lt;/a&gt; of the MSU &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; team.

MSU's &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt; team won &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Boxing%20Championship\"&gt;national titles&lt;/a&gt; in 1951 and 1955, although it is no longer an NCAA &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20team\"&gt;varsity&lt;/a&gt; sport.\nWater sports at MSU include rowing and swimming. MSU's women's &lt;a href=\"rowing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;rowing&lt;/a&gt; coach is Matt Weise, who is in his tenth year as the Spartan crew coach. In his third year as MSU head coach, Weise coached the Spartans to a program-best sixth-place team finish at the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Rowing%20Championships\"&gt;NCAA Championship&lt;/a&gt;.

Golf has had a long tradition at MSU. Hall of Fame Coach Bruce Fossum helped carry MSU to its first Big Ten title in 1969. The Big Ten title would elude the Spartans until 2005, when arguably, the best team ever assembled, took home the rings in stellar fashion. Not only did the Spartans win the Big Ten Championship in 2005, but they captured two other titles along the way and rose all the way to #5 in the U.S. Casey Lubahn coaches the men's &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; team. A former assistant coach at &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20University\"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, this is his fourth year as a head coach.\nStacy Slobodnik-Stoll coaches the women's team.

Coaching the women's team is Kim Bruno, who is in her 4th season at the helm.\nNotable non-varsity sports.\nRugby.\nThe Michigan State University Rugby Football Club was founded in 1964. Michigan State rugby has been steadily improving in &lt;a href=\"College%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;college rugby&lt;/a&gt; in recent years. During the 2010\u201311 season, the Spartans played in Division 2, finishing with a 10\u20133 record and qualifying for the playoffs. The Spartans' success led to them moving up to Division 1\u2013AA for the 2011\u201312 season. For the 2012\u201313 season, the Spartans once again moved to a higher level of competition\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Universities\"&gt;Big Ten Universities&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"College%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;D1\u2013A conference&lt;/a&gt;, against traditional &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten\"&gt;Big Ten&lt;/a&gt; rivals such as the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Michigan\"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20University\"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;. The success of Spartan Rugby is greatly attributed to former head coach Dave Poquette, who had been coaching at Michigan State since 1992 and retired in 2013.\nWater Polo.\nThe Michigan State University Water Polo Club was founded and officially recognized November 17, 1967. At the time of its inception, the team played in the Midwest Collegiate Water Polo Association, along with Iowa, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio State, Loyola, Drake, and Western Michigan. Now competing in the Big Ten division of the Collegiate Water Polo Association, Michigan State is joined by Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Northwestern, Wisconsin, Purdue, and Illinois, with Ohio State moving to the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. After winning back-to-back Big Ten championships in 1993 and 1994, the Spartans would go the next half a decade without a Big Ten Championship. With another conference championship, the Spartans would go on to win their first national collegiate club championship in 2000. Michigan State would continue to enjoy much success in the 2000s, winning the Big Ten Championship in 2002 and from 2005\u20132010. This included an impressive four year stretch which included the Spartan's second and third national championships in 2006 and 2008, and runner-up finishes for the national title in 2005 and 2007, as well as a third-place finish in 2010. In 2014, the Spartans would stage a comeback in the final two minutes of regulation to upset Michigan in the Big Ten title game for their eleventh Big Ten Championship, and their seventh in ten years.\nMSU Athletics Hall of Fame.\nIn 1992, thirty former Spartan &lt;a href=\"sportsperson\"&gt;athlete&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coach%20%28sports%29\"&gt;coaches&lt;/a&gt;, and administrators were inducted into the MSU Athletics &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; as its charter class. On October 1, 1999, the University opened its new Athletics Hall of Fame, in the Clara Bell Smith Student-Athlete Academic Center.\nChampionships.\nNCAA team championships.\nMichigan State has won 20 NCAA national team titles.\nOther national team championships.\nBelow are 10 national team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA."
