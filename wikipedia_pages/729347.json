    "text": "The Center for Wooden Boats (CWB) is a museum dedicated to preserving and documenting the &lt;a href=\"maritime%20history\"&gt;maritime history&lt;/a&gt; of the Pacific Northwest area of the United States. CWB was founded by Dick Wagner in Seattle in the 1970s and has grown to include three sites; the South &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Union\"&gt;Lake Union&lt;/a&gt; campus in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Union%20Park\"&gt;Lake Union Park&lt;/a&gt;, the Northlake Workshop &amp; Warehouse at the North end of Lake Union, and The Center for Wooden Boats at &lt;a href=\"Cama%20Beach%20State%20Park\"&gt;Cama Beach State Park&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Camano%20Island\"&gt;Camano Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollection.\nThe CWB collection includes more than 170 vessels, mostly small &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"rowboat\"&gt;rowboat&lt;/a&gt;s. The boats are divided into a number of sections. The &lt;a href=\"Boat%20livery\"&gt;livery&lt;/a&gt; fleet includes daysailers, rowboats, and two &lt;a href=\"pedalo\"&gt;pedal boats&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blanchard%20Junior%20Knockabout\"&gt;Blanchard Junior Knockabout&lt;/a&gt; is the mainstay of CWB's rental fleet. These boats were designed and built at the Blanchard Boat Company on Lake Union. They have eight, which are used for teaching and rentals."
