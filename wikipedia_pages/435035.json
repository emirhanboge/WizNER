    "text": "North Hollywood, in the &lt;a href=\"San%20Fernando%20Valley\"&gt;San Fernando Valley&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt;, is an eclectic neighborhood with modest residential blocks and the &lt;a href=\"NoHo%20Arts%20District\"&gt;NoHo Arts District&lt;/a&gt;. Arts in NoHo include the El Portal Theatre as well as many new playhouses, art galleries, sound studios, and the Academy of TV Arts and Sciences. North Hollywood is one of the few &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Metro%20Rail\"&gt;subway-accessible&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods in Los Angeles.\nNorth Hollywood was established by the Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company in 1887. It was first named Toluca before being renamed Lankershim in 1896 and finally North Hollywood in 1927.\nDemographics.\nThe 2000 U.S. census counted 77,848 residents in the 5.87-square-mile North Hollywood neighborhood\u2014or 13,264 people per square mile, about an average &lt;a href=\"population%20density\"&gt;population density&lt;/a&gt; for the city but among the highest for the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 87,241. In 2000 the median age for residents was 30, considered an average age for city and county neighborhoods; the percentage of residents aged 19 to 34 was among the county's highest.\nThe neighborhood was considered \"moderately diverse\" ethnically within Los Angeles. The breakdown was 57.7% &lt;a href=\"Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans\"&gt;Latino&lt;/a&gt;, 27% &lt;a href=\"Non-Hispanic%20White\"&gt;Non-Hispanic White&lt;/a&gt;, 5.7% &lt;a href=\"Asian%20American\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt;, 5.6% &lt;a href=\"African%20American\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, and 4% from other groups. Foreign-born residents made up 46.4% of residents, a high percentage for Los Angeles; Mexico (43.2%) and El Salvador (16%) were the most common places of birth for this portion of the population. The percentages of never-married men and never-married women were among the county's highest.\nThe median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $42,791, considered average for the city but low for the county. The percentages of households that earned $40,000 or less were high for the county. Renters occupied 75.4% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 24.6%.\nGeography.\nNorth Hollywood is bordered on the north by &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Valley%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Sun Valley&lt;/a&gt; and on the northeast and east by &lt;a href=\"Burbank%2C%20California\"&gt;Burbank&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Toluca%20Lake%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Toluca Lake&lt;/a&gt; borders North Hollywood on the southeast and south, and &lt;a href=\"Studio%20City%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Studio City&lt;/a&gt; abuts it on the southwest. It is flanked by &lt;a href=\"Valley%20Village%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Valley Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valley%20Glen%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Valley Glen&lt;/a&gt; on the west.\nNorth Hollywood is not contiguous with &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, being separated by other parts of the San Fernando Valley and the &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Hills\"&gt;Hollywood Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorth Hollywood displays a hot summer &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Climate\"&gt;Mediterranean Climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; Csa).\nHistory.\nBefore annexation.\nNorth Hollywood was once part of the vast landholdings of the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20San%20Fernando%20Rey%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a\"&gt;Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;, which was confiscated by the government during the Mexican period of rule.\nA group of investors assembled as the San Fernando Farm Homestead Association purchased the southern half of the &lt;a href=\"Rancho%20Ex-Mission%20San%20Fernando\"&gt;Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando&lt;/a&gt;. The leading investor was &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Lankershim\"&gt;Isaac Lankershim&lt;/a&gt;, a Northern California stockman and grain farmer, who was impressed by the Valley's wild oats and proposed to raise sheep on the property. In 1873, Isaac Lankershim's son and future son-in-law, &lt;a href=\"James%20Boon%20Lankershim\"&gt;James Boon Lankershim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton%20Van%20Nuys\"&gt;Isaac Newton Van Nuys&lt;/a&gt;, moved to the San Fernando Valley and took over management of the property. Van Nuys thought the property could profitably grow wheat using the &lt;a href=\"dryland%20farming\"&gt;dryland farming&lt;/a&gt; technique developed on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Plains\"&gt;Great Plains&lt;/a&gt; and leased land from the Association to test his theories. In time, the Lankershim property, under its third name, the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company, would become the world's largest wheat-growing empire.\nIn October 1887, J.B. Lankershim and eight other developers organized the Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company, purchasing north of the Cahuenga Pass from the Lankershim Farming and Milling Company. Lankershim established a townsite which the residents named Toluca along the old road from &lt;a href=\"Cahuenga%20Pass\"&gt;Cahuenga Pass&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"San%20Fernando%2C%20California\"&gt;San Fernando&lt;/a&gt;. On April 1, 1888, they offered ready-made small farms for sale, already planted with deep-rooted deciduous fruit and nut trees\u2014mostly peaches, pears, apricots, and walnuts\u2014that could survive the rainless summers of the Valley by relying on the high &lt;a href=\"water%20table\"&gt;water table&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=\"Tujunga%20Wash\"&gt;Tujunga Wash&lt;/a&gt; rather than surface irrigation.\nThe land boom of the 1880s went bust by the 1890s, but despite another brutal drought cycle in the late 1890s, the fruit and nut farmers remained solvent. The Toluca Fruit Growers Association was formed in 1894. The next year the Southern Pacific opened a branch line slanting northwest across the Valley to &lt;a href=\"Chatsworth%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Chatsworth&lt;/a&gt;. The Chatsworth Limited made one freight stop a day at Toluca, though the depot bore the new name of Lankershim. With the post office across the street being called Toluca, controversy over the town's name continued, and the local ranchers used to quip, \"Ship the merchandise to Lankershim, but bill it to Toluca.\" In 1896, under pressure from Lankershim, the post office at Toluca was renamed \"Lankershim\" after his father, although the new name of the town would not be officially recognized until 1905.\nBy 1903, the area was known as \"The Home of the Peach\". In 1912, the area's major employer, the Bonner Fruit Company, was canning over a million tons of peaches, apricots, and other fruits. When the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Aqueduct\"&gt;Los Angeles Aqueduct&lt;/a&gt; opened in 1913, Valley farmers offered to buy the surplus water, but the federal legislation that enabled the construction of the aqueduct prohibited Los Angeles from selling the water outside of the city limits.\nAt first, resistance to the real-estate development and downtown business interests of Los Angeles remained strong enough to keep the small farmers unified in opposition to annexation. However, the fruit packing company interests were taken over by the Los Angeles interests. The two conspired to decrease prices and mitigate the farmers' profit margins, making their continued existence tenuous. When droughts hit the valley again, rather than face foreclosure, the most vulnerable farmers agreed to mortgage their holdings to the fruit packing company and banks in Los Angeles for the immediate future and vote on annexation.\nAfter annexation.\nWest Lankershim (more or less today's Valley Village) agreed to be annexed to the City of Los Angeles in 1919. Lankershim proper joined in 1923. Much of the promised water delivery was withheld, and many of the ranchers one by one had their holding foreclosed or transferred to the packing companies. In turn, these were bought up by the real-estate developers and by the late 1920s a massive effort was underway to market the area to prospective home owners throughout the country. As part of this effort, in 1927, in an effort to capitalize on the glamour and proximity of Hollywood, Lankershim was renamed \"North Hollywood\". The result was a massive development of housing which transformed the area into a suburban development of Los Angeles.\nValley Plaza and Laurel Plaza.\nIn the late 1940s and 1950s the area saw the first department-store-anchored, auto-oriented shopping center in the Valley: &lt;a href=\"Valley%20Plaza\"&gt;Valley Plaza&lt;/a&gt;, covering both a development at Laurel Canyon at Victory boulevards but also a loose collection of other retail stores south along Laurel Canyon to Oxnard, including a branch of the &lt;a href=\"May%20Company%20California\"&gt;May Co.&lt;/a&gt;, the second-largest suburban department store branch in the U.S. at the time. In the mid-1950s Valley Plaza claimed to be the largest shopping center on the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;West Coast of the United States&lt;/a&gt; and the third-largest in the country. The May Co. at the south end of the Valley Plaza shopping district built its own attached, enclosed mall, &lt;a href=\"Laurel%20Plaza\"&gt;Laurel Plaza&lt;/a&gt;, opening in 1968. The last department of Valley Plaza's anchors, &lt;a href=\"Sears\"&gt;Sears&lt;/a&gt;, closed in 2019 as department store-anchored shopping centers lost favor. As of 2020, much of the Valley Plaza retail space is either empty, portion is now a middle school, and the Laurel Plaza site is under construction to become NOHO West, a &lt;a href=\"mixed-use%20development\"&gt;mixed-use development&lt;/a&gt; including retail.\n\"Downtown\" (Lankershim shopping district).\nLankershim Blvd. around Magnolia Blvd. was the heart of the town of Lankershim and of North Hollywood and until the mid-1950s boasted the largest concentration of retail stores, banks, restaurants, and entertainment. In 1953, for example, the shopping strip included three full-line department stores: &lt;a href=\"J.C.%20Penney\"&gt;J.C. Penney&lt;/a&gt; at 5261 Lankershim, Yeakel &amp; Goss department store at 5272, and the upscale single-location &lt;a href=\"Rathbun%27s\"&gt;Rathbun's&lt;/a&gt; department store at nos. 5307\u201315. There were also branches of the large &lt;a href=\"Harris%20%26amp%3B%20Frank\"&gt;Harris &amp; Frank&lt;/a&gt; clothing chain at 5236 Lankershim, &lt;a href=\"J.%20J.%20Newberry\"&gt;J. J. Newberry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"five%20and%20dime\"&gt;five and dime&lt;/a&gt; at 5321, and &lt;a href=\"Safeway%20Inc.\"&gt;Safeway&lt;/a&gt; at 5356. But nearby &lt;a href=\"Valley%20Plaza\"&gt;Valley Plaza&lt;/a&gt; shopping center, designed for accessibility by car with plenty of free parking, opened in 1951 and kept growing until by 1956 it claimed to be the third-largest shopping center in the country. It was difficult for the Lankershim retail district to compete and by 1980, most stores had closed including iconic Rathbun's.\nChanging demographics.\nBy the late 1950s, many of the original owners were aging, and their children were moving to other areas. School integration in the subsequent years, &lt;a href=\"blockbusting\"&gt;blockbusting&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequent ethnic turmoil encouraged many remaining families to move out, who in turn were replaced with black and Hispanic families moving from the downtown areas. By the 1990s, the demographic changes had almost completely transformed the region.\n1990s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"North%20Hollywood%20shootout\"&gt;North Hollywood shootout&lt;/a&gt; occurred in 1997, leaving 12 &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Los Angeles Police Department&lt;/a&gt; officers and eight civilians injured and the two armed robbers dead.\nRenovation.\nThe opening of &lt;a href=\"North%20Hollywood%20station\"&gt;North Hollywood station&lt;/a&gt; in 2000, establishment and success of the &lt;a href=\"NoHo%20Arts%20District%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;NoHo Arts District&lt;/a&gt; in the old \"downtown\", and repurposing of disused lots such as &lt;a href=\"Laurel%20Plaza\"&gt;Laurel Plaza&lt;/a&gt; into NOHO West, has revitalized the heart of North Hollywood.\n21st century.\nSince 2000, the community has been developing and undergoing many changes, thanks in large part to the formation of the 743-acre North Hollywood Development District and the subsequent NoHo Commons projects.\nIn 2015, Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood was part of the first San Fernando Valley &lt;a href=\"CicLAvia\"&gt;CicLAvia&lt;/a&gt;, an event sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County%20Metropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority\"&gt;Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority&lt;/a&gt; in which major roads are temporarily closed to motorized vehicle traffic and used for recreational &lt;a href=\"human-powered%20transport\"&gt;human-powered transport&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttractions.\nNorth Hollywood is home to the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Television%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences\"&gt;Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Valhalla%20Memorial%20Park%20Cemetery\"&gt;Pierce Brothers Valhalla Memorial Park&lt;/a&gt; is located in the area, and includes the &lt;a href=\"Portal%20of%20the%20Folded%20Wings%20Shrine%20to%20Aviation\"&gt;Portal of the Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Universal%20Studios\"&gt;Universal Studios&lt;/a&gt; is also located on the border between &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; and North Hollywood, easily accessible through one of NoHo's main streets, Lankershim Boulevard. Universal Studios has several attractions inside the actual park and in the non-paid CityWalk section. North Hollywood has several art houses, restaurants and theaters as well.\nGovernment and infrastructure.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County%20Department%20of%20Health%20Services\"&gt;Los Angeles County Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; has the Antelope Valley Area Health Office and the San Fernando Valley Area Health Office in a facility in North Hollywood. The department operates the North Hollywood Health Center in North Hollywood. In addition the department operates the Glendale Health Center in &lt;a href=\"Glendale%2C%20California\"&gt;Glendale&lt;/a&gt;, serving North Hollywood.\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Postal%20Service\"&gt;United States Postal Service&lt;/a&gt; operates the North Hollywood Post Office at 7035 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, the Valley Plaza Post Office at 6418 Bellingham Avenue, and the Victory Center Post Office at 6535 Lankershim Boulevard.\nTransportation.\nThe Los Angeles County Transportation Commission approved the construction of the subway connecting North Hollywood to Hollywood, East Hollywood, Koreatown, Westlake and downtown Los Angeles along the Metro Rail Red Line in 1990. The decision followed the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20City%20Council\"&gt;Los Angeles City Council&lt;/a&gt; unanimously endorsing North Hollywood as the northern terminal of the Red Line with the final route having termini at Union Station and North Hollywood. The &lt;a href=\"North%20Hollywood%20%28Los%20Angeles%20Metro%20station%29\"&gt;North Hollywood Metro Subway station&lt;/a&gt; opened in June 2000. Close to half a million people took advantage of free rides on the Red Line subway in its first weekend in operation. The station is the starting point for the &lt;a href=\"B%20Line%20%28Los%20Angeles%20Metro%29\"&gt;B Line&lt;/a&gt; of the Metro subway, which cost $4.5\u00a0billion to build.\nInstead of a further B Line extension further into the Valley, Metro built the &lt;a href=\"G%20Line%20%28Los%20Angeles%20Metro%29\"&gt;Metro G Line&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bus%20rapid%20transit\"&gt;bus rapid transit&lt;/a&gt;. Its terminus is located across the &lt;a href=\"street\"&gt;street&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"North%20Hollywood%20%28Los%20Angeles%20Metro%20station%29\"&gt;subway station&lt;/a&gt;. This expanded the station area into a &lt;a href=\"transport%20hub\"&gt;transit hub&lt;/a&gt;, and many &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Local%20%28Los%20Angeles%20County%29\"&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Rapid%20%28Los%20Angeles%20County%29\"&gt;rapid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bus\"&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt;es now stop at the station. Proposals have been made to extend the B Line northeasterly to Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and the Burbank Metrolink station in central Burbank, or to extend it in a northwesterly direction along Lankershim Boulevard and eventually to Sylmar. Neither project is currently funded nor is in Metro's Long Term Transportation Plan.\nEducation.\nEighteen percent of North Hollywood residents aged 25 and older had earned a &lt;a href=\"four-year%20degree\"&gt;four-year degree&lt;/a&gt; by 2000, an average figure for both the city and the county. The percentage of the same-age residents with less than a &lt;a href=\"high%20school%20diploma\"&gt;high school diploma&lt;/a&gt; was high for the county.\nSchools within the North Hollywood boundaries are:\nRecreation and parks.\nThe North Hollywood Recreation Center is mostly in North Hollywood, with a portion in &lt;a href=\"Valley%20Village%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Valley Village&lt;/a&gt;. The park has an auditorium, lighted indoor baseball diamond courts, lighted outdoor baseball diamonds, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children's play area, lighted handball courts, picnic tables, an outdoor unheated seasonal pool, and lighted tennis courts. In addition the center has an indoor gymnasium which can be used as a second auditorium and a community room; the gymnasium's capacity is 250 people.\nThe Valley Plaza Recreation Center in North Hollywood includes an auditorium, barbecue pits, a lighted baseball diamond, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children's play area, a 40-person community room, a lighted American football field, an indoor gymnasium without weights, an outdoor gymnasium without weights, picnic tables, lighted tennis courts, and unlighted volleyball courts. The Jamie Beth Slaven Park, an unstaffed pocket park with unlighted outdoor basketball courts, a children's play area, and picnic tables, is in North Hollywood."
