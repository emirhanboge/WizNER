    "text": "The 1960\u201361 season was the 81st season of competitive &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. This season was a particularly historic one for domestic football in England, as &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt; became the first club in the twentieth century to \"do the Double\" by winning both the League and the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; competitions in the same season.\nOverview.\nTottenham Hotspur sealed the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;Football League First Division&lt;/a&gt; title with a 2\u20131 home win over &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; on 17 April 1961. &lt;a href=\"Preston%20North%20End\"&gt;Preston North End&lt;/a&gt;, who had been the first team to achieve the League and FA Cup \"double\", was relegated in last place \u2013 and to date have not returned to the top flight of English football since. 1960\u201361 still remains the last time Tottenham Hotspur won the League Championship.\n&lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%20F.C.\"&gt;Portsmouth F.C.&lt;/a&gt; became the first former &lt;a href=\"English%20football%20champions\"&gt;English League champion&lt;/a&gt; to be relegated to the Third Division, ten years after winning their second title.\n&lt;a href=\"Peterborough%20United\"&gt;Peterborough United&lt;/a&gt; set a football league record by scoring the most league goals in one season (134).\nFA Cup.\n&lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20130 to win the &lt;a href=\"1961%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1961 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt; to become the first team in the 20th Century to win &lt;a href=\"double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;the double&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeague Cup.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1960%E2%80%9361%20Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;1960\u201361&lt;/a&gt; was the inaugural staging of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Football League Cup&lt;/a&gt;, The tournament was won by &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;, who beat &lt;a href=\"Rotherham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Rotherham United&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20132 on aggregate after extra time. Although Aston Villa are credited as the League Cup Winners in 1960\u201361, both legs of the Final were held over until after the commencement of the &lt;a href=\"1961%E2%80%9362%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1961\u201362 season&lt;/a&gt; due to fixture congestion. Villa finally lifted the trophy on 5 September 1961.\nTransfers.\nIn June 1961, &lt;a href=\"Denis%20Law\"&gt;Denis Law&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Torino\"&gt;Torino&lt;/a&gt; in a \u00a3100,000 deal \u2013 a record fee involving a British player.\nAwards.\n&lt;a href=\"Football%20Writers%27%20Association\"&gt;Football Writers' Association&lt;/a&gt;\nFootball League.\nFirst Division.\nTottenham Hotspur made history by becoming the first team this century to win &lt;a href=\"Double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;the double&lt;/a&gt;, which in recent seasons had narrowly eluded the likes of Manchester United and Wolves.\nSheffield Wednesday finished runners-up, but an eight-point finishing divide between themselves and the champions meant that they never really looked like claiming the league title which had last been theirs in 1930. Wolves, Everton and defending champions Burnley completed the top five, while FA Cup runners-up Leicester City enjoyed a strong sixth-place finish and Manchester United finished seventh for the second season running.\nAston Villa's failure to mount a title challenge was compensated for by victory in the first-ever edition of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Football League Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreston North End performed dismally in their first season without retired winger &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Finney\"&gt;Tom Finney&lt;/a&gt;, and went down in bottom place, joined in relegation by Newcastle United.\nSecond Division.\n&lt;a href=\"Alf%20Ramsey\"&gt;Alf Ramsey's&lt;/a&gt; impressive Ipswich side reached the First Division for the first time in their history by winning the Second Division title \u2013 an impressive showing for a club who had been in non-league football 25 years earlier. They were joined in promotion by a more illustrious club in the shape of &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt;, who have been no strangers to the elite of English football. Liverpool just missed out on First Division football once again, while Norwich City achieved their best final position yet by finishing fourth.\nLincoln City went down in bottom place and were joined in the Third Division by Portsmouth, league champions just over a decade earlier.\nThird Division.\nBury won promotion to the Second Division as champions of the Third Division and were joined in the higher division by runners-up Walsall.\nChesterfield, Colchester United and Tranmere Rovers, who had all spent most or all of their history in nothing higher than the league's third tier, went down to the Fourth Division, but were relegated along with a Bradford City side who had played in the First Division for a number of seasons until 1922 and were FA Cup winners in 1911.\nFourth Division.\nPeterborough United enjoyed a blistering debut in the Football League, finding the net 134 times (with 52 goals coming from centre-forward &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Bly\"&gt;Terry Bly&lt;/a&gt;) and clinching the Fourth Division title. They were joined in promotion by Crystal Palace, Northampton Town and Bradford Park Avenue.\nTop goalscorers.\nFirst Division\nSecond Division\nThird Division\nFourth Division"
