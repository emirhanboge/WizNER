    "text": "U.S. Route 69 (US 69) is a north\u2013south &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20highway\"&gt;United States highway&lt;/a&gt; that runs from &lt;a href=\"Port%20Arthur%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Port Arthur, Texas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Lea%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Albert Lea, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. In Texas, US 69 runs from Port Arthur near the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; state line just north of &lt;a href=\"Denison%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Denison&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoute description.\nUS 69 begins at its southern terminus with &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%2087\"&gt;SH 87&lt;/a&gt; in Port Arthur. This intersection is also the southern terminus for &lt;a href=\"US%2096\"&gt;US 96&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"US%20287\"&gt;US 287&lt;/a&gt;, which are concurrent with US 69. US 69, US 96, and US 287 continue in a northwest, then west, route until its intersection with &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2010%20in%20Texas\"&gt;Interstate 10&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Beaumont%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Beaumont&lt;/a&gt;. At this intersection, US 69, US 96, and US 287 merge with I-10. I-10/US 69/US 96/US 287 continue in a northerly direction through Beaumont for several miles. Just after the intersection with &lt;a href=\"US%2090\"&gt;US 90&lt;/a&gt;, I-10 splits from the multiplex and resumes its easterly course, leaving US 69, US 96, and US 287 heading northwest through Beaumont. US 69 north of I-10 is also known officially known as Eastex Freeway, and is an official evacuation route, just as &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2069%20in%20Texas\"&gt;Interstate 69&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"US%2059%20%28TX%29\"&gt;US 59&lt;/a&gt; heading north from Houston is known as Eastex Freeway as well.\nIn Lumberton, &lt;a href=\"US%2096\"&gt;US 96&lt;/a&gt; splits from US 69 and &lt;a href=\"US%20287\"&gt;US 287&lt;/a&gt; and heads northeast towards &lt;a href=\"Jasper%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Jasper&lt;/a&gt;, while US 69 and US 287 continue on a northwest path towards &lt;a href=\"Woodville%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Woodville&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Woodville, US 69 splits from &lt;a href=\"US%20287\"&gt;US 287&lt;/a&gt; a few blocks north of &lt;a href=\"US%20190\"&gt;US 190&lt;/a&gt;. US 287 continues northwest towards &lt;a href=\"Corrigan%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Corrigan&lt;/a&gt; while US 69 proceed north towards &lt;a href=\"Lufkin%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Lufkin&lt;/a&gt;. In this area, between US 190 in Woodville and FM 256 in &lt;a href=\"Colmesneil%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Colmesneil&lt;/a&gt;, US 69 is a part of the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Forest%20Trail\"&gt;Texas Forest Trail&lt;/a&gt;. Before reaching Lufkin, US 69 forms another segment of the Texas Forest Trail between &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%2063\"&gt;SH 63&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zavalla%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Zavalla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farm%20to%20Market%20Road%201818\"&gt;FM 1818&lt;/a&gt; northwest of Zavalla.\nIn Lufkin, US 69 is concurrent with &lt;a href=\"US%2059\"&gt;US 59&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%20Loop%20287\"&gt;State Loop 287&lt;/a&gt; while the route through the city is named Business US 69. US 69, State Loop 287, and US 59 continue around the east side of Lufkin until US 59 separates at the intersection with &lt;a href=\"US%2059%20Business\"&gt;US 59 Business&lt;/a&gt; northeast of Lufkin. US 69 and State Loop 287 continue until the intersection of &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%20103\"&gt;SH 103&lt;/a&gt; and Business US 69 on the northwest section of Lufkin. At that point, US 69 is concurrent for a short distance with SH 103 and State Loop 287. At the intersection of US 69, State Loop 287 and SH 103, US 69 departs Lufkin and heads northwest while SH 103 and State Loop 287 head south.\nUS 69 continues on a north to northwest path through the towns of &lt;a href=\"Alto%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Alto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rusk%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Rusk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Jacksonville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bullard%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Bullard&lt;/a&gt;. Just south of Bullard, US 69 has a short concurrency with &lt;a href=\"Farm%20to%20Market%20Road%202493\"&gt;FM 2493&lt;/a&gt;. US 69 continues northward into &lt;a href=\"Tyler%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Tyler&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Tyler, US 69 continues northward through the city until the intersection of &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%20110\"&gt;SH 110&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%20155\"&gt;SH 155&lt;/a&gt;, where US 69 heads west and merges with SH 110 and SH 155 through Tyler. Around seven blocks from the intersection of US 69, SH 110, and SH 155, SH 155 separates from the concurrency and travels in a southwesterly direction, leaving US 69 and SH 110 traveling in a northwesterly direction. This continues until SH 110 separates from US 69 on the northwest side of Tyler. At this intersection, SH 110 heads west while US 69 continues north.\nUS 69 crosses &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2020%20in%20Texas\"&gt;Interstate 20&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lindale%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Lindale&lt;/a&gt; where it is signed as \"Main Street\". At &lt;a href=\"Farm%20to%20Market%20Road%2016\"&gt;FM 16&lt;/a&gt; in Lindale, US 69 begins its third and last segment as part of the Texas Forest Trail. US 69 continues north to northwest to &lt;a href=\"Mineola%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Mineola&lt;/a&gt;, crossing &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2080\"&gt;US 80&lt;/a&gt; there. Before leaving town, at its intersection with &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%2037\"&gt;SH 37&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas Forest Trail turns off of US 69 to share a segment with SH 37. US 69 takes a more northwest turn on its way through several small towns, including &lt;a href=\"Emory%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Emory&lt;/a&gt;, on its way to &lt;a href=\"Greenville%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Greenville&lt;/a&gt;. There, as it begins to enter the city, a Business route of US 69 turns off to the right to serve the downtown Greenville area, and then on to a junction with &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2030%20in%20Texas\"&gt;Interstate 30&lt;/a&gt;. At the intersection with I-30, US 69 becomes concurrent with &lt;a href=\"US%20380\"&gt;US 380&lt;/a&gt; at its terminus. The concurrency continues around the southern and western sides of Greenville until an intersection with &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%20Spur%20302\"&gt;Spur 302&lt;/a&gt;. At that intersection, US 380 heads west while US 69 continues north, until it reaches the northern end of its Business route, which has passed through the downtown Greenville area, then US 69 turns northwest, from Greenville to &lt;a href=\"Leonard%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Leonard&lt;/a&gt;, where it encounters a brief concurrency with &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%2078\"&gt;SH 78&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Whitewright%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Whitewright&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%2011\"&gt;SH 11&lt;/a&gt; intersects and becomes concurrent with US 69 southeast of town. This continues until the intersection with &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%20160\"&gt;SH 160&lt;/a&gt;, at which time SH 11 continues on a northwestward route and US 69 continues north through Whitewright.\nUS 69 continues north, then northwest until &lt;a href=\"Denison%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Denison&lt;/a&gt;, where it turns right to go north, at an intersection with &lt;a href=\"Texas%20State%20Highway%20Spur%20503\"&gt;Spur 503&lt;/a&gt;. US 69 goes north through downtown Denison, then at the north side of town, US 69 intersects and merges with &lt;a href=\"US%2075\"&gt;US 75&lt;/a&gt;, at which time US 69 becomes concurrent with US 75. Both head northeast across the Oklahoma/Texas border at the &lt;a href=\"Red%20River%20of%20the%20South\"&gt;Red River&lt;/a&gt;."
