It lies within the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20of%20Bowland\"&gt;Forest of Bowland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty&lt;/a&gt; but was not part of the ancient Forest or the &lt;a href=\"Lordship%20of%20Bowland\"&gt;Lordship of Bowland&lt;/a&gt;. There is no Lawkland village as such although there are clusters of farms and dwellings around Lawkland Green and Eldroth.\nIn 2014 those parts of Lawkland parish north of the A65 (including the hamlet of Feizor) were transferred to Austwick parish. Lawkland parish gained those parts of Austwick parish south of the A65. Lawkland does not have a parish council but does have an annual parish meeting."
