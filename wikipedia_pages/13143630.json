    "text": "FC Kaliakra Kavarna () is a &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club from the town of &lt;a href=\"Kavarna\"&gt;Kavarna&lt;/a&gt;, which currently competes in the &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Amateur%20Football%20Groups%20%28Bulgaria%29\"&gt;A RFG Dobrich&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth tier of Bulgarian football.\nFounded in 1922 as Kaliakra Sport Club, the club spent most of its history in amateur football before making a rapid ascent to the second-flight of Bulgarian football in 1980. In &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20B%20Group\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;, the team managed to promote to the A Group for the first time. Their spell in the top flight lasted two seasons, ending in relegation in &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20A%20Group\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;.\nKaliakra Kavarna's name is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Kaliakra\"&gt;Kaliakra&lt;/a&gt; cape, which is located nearby the town. The team plays in all-blue home kits, in reference to the geographic proximity of the city of Kavarna and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt;, similarly to other teams from the area. The lighthouse of Kavarna is also shown on the team logo.\nAddress and team information.\n\"Sava Ganchev\" street, Stadium \"Kavarna\", &lt;a href=\"Kavarna\"&gt;Kavarna&lt;/a&gt; 9650, &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;\nEquipment.\nCurrently the team's home kit is blue and away kit is white. A various combinations of blue and white can be seen through the years. But blue remains the basic colour of the team.\nHistory.\nKaliakra was established in 1922, and has had its current name since 1957. The official colors were initially chosen as blue and white. During its history the club has also been named Venus Venera, Bizone, SC Dobrotich, SC Spartak and Cherveno zname.\nThe club spent most of its history in amateur football before winning promotion for the second-flight of Bulgarian football in 1980. In the first campaign in &lt;a href=\"B%20PFG\"&gt;B PFG&lt;/a&gt;, Kaliakra survived relegation back to third division at the end of 1980\u201381, but with only point more than rivals Chernolomets Popovo. The next season meant a 14th place for the team, but in 1982-83 Kaliakra won just eleven games during the entire campaign and were relegated. The team spent the next 22 years in third division, before being promoted for the second time to &lt;a href=\"B%20PFG\"&gt;B PFG&lt;/a&gt; during the 2004-05 season. They finished their first campaign in the 2005/06 B PFG in 10th place.\nIn 2007-08 season Kaliakra had their best &lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20Cup%202007%E2%80%9308\"&gt;Bulgarian Cup&lt;/a&gt; run ever, beating &lt;a href=\"FC%20Chavdar%20Etropole\"&gt;Chavdar Etropole&lt;/a&gt; and elite &lt;a href=\"PFC%20Lokomotiv%20Plovdiv\"&gt;Lokomotiv Plovdiv&lt;/a&gt; before losing to &lt;a href=\"PFC%20Cherno%20More%20Varna\"&gt;Cherno More Varna&lt;/a&gt; on penalties in the semi-finals. The season in the domestic league was also successful for the team, after they finished 2nd, and qualified for the play-off for promotion in the &lt;a href=\"A%20PFG\"&gt;top division&lt;/a&gt;. But on May 24, 2008, Kaliakra lost against &lt;a href=\"Minyor%20Pernik\"&gt;Minyor Pernik&lt;/a&gt; with a result of 6:7 (after &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalties&lt;/a&gt;) in the play-off.\nIn 2009\u201310 Kaliakra reached the &lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20Cup\"&gt;Bulgarian Cup&lt;/a&gt; semi-finals for second time in the club's history, but lost 3-0 after penalties (1-1 in regular time) to &lt;a href=\"PFC%20Chernomorets%20Pomorie\"&gt;Chernomorets Pomorie&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Pomorie%20Stadium\"&gt;Pomorie Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. A month later they won a first promotion to the &lt;a href=\"A%20PFG\"&gt;A PFG&lt;/a&gt; by winning the &lt;a href=\"B%20PFG\"&gt;Eastern B PFG&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"2010-11%20A%20Group\"&gt;2010-11 season&lt;/a&gt; was historic for Kaliakra, as it was their first ever season in the Bulgarian elite. The team began the campaign under the management of Filip Filipov, starting strong, with an away 0-1 win against &lt;a href=\"Slavia%20Sofia\"&gt;Slavia Sofia&lt;/a&gt;. However, Kaliakra then dropped their form and at the end of round 12, the team was in 13th position. Filipov was sacked and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Antoni%20Zdravkov\"&gt;Antoni Zdravkov&lt;/a&gt; on 7 October. Under Zdravkov, Kavarna improved somewhat, although the team was still in danger of relegation up until round 25. Good results in the last couple of rounds improved their position on the table, eventually leading Kaliakra to a 12th place finish, thus avoiding relegation. The team ended the season with eight wins, six draws, as well as 16 losses, earning them 30 points. \nFor the &lt;a href=\"2011-12%20A%20Group\"&gt;2011-12 season&lt;/a&gt;, which would be Kaliakra's second season in the elite, Zdravkov's contract was not renewed, so he was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Adalbert%20Zafirov\"&gt;Adalbert Zafirov&lt;/a&gt;, prior to the start of the season. The 2011-12 season proved to be much more difficult for Kaliakra, as the team spent the majority of the season in the relegation zone. Zafirov was sacked on 19 October, being replaced by Radostin Trifonov. This did not improve the team's results, as the team remained in 15th position until the end of the season, thus were relegated. Kaliakra ended the season with only 11 points, with only &lt;a href=\"FC%20Svetkavitsa%20Targovishte\"&gt;FC Svetkavitsa Targovishte&lt;/a&gt; having less points (only 8). Kavarna only won two games, against &lt;a href=\"Beroe%20Stara%20Zagora\"&gt;Beroe Stara Zagora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PFC%20Vidima-Rakovski%20Sevlievo\"&gt;PFC Vidima-Rakovski Sevlievo&lt;/a&gt;, both of which were home wins. Away results were horrible, with the team earning only one point from away games, a 1-1 draw against &lt;a href=\"Minyor%20Pernik\"&gt;Minyor Pernik&lt;/a&gt;.\nKaliakra was relegated to the &lt;a href=\"B%20PFG\"&gt;B PFG&lt;/a&gt; after two years in the top division. After two more years in B PFG Kaliakra was relegated back to the amateur divisions, ending nearly a decade of professional football.\nHonours.\nDomestic.\n&lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20A%20PFG\"&gt;Bulgarian A PFG&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20B%20Professional%20Football%20Group\"&gt;Bulgarian B Group&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bulgarian%20Cup\"&gt;Bulgarian Cup&lt;/a&gt;:\nCurrent squad.\nForeign players.\nUp to one non-EU national can be registered and given a squad number for the first team in the &lt;a href=\"B%20PFG\"&gt;B PFG&lt;/a&gt;.

The club's home stadium was built in 1967. It is situated in the Kaliakra Sport Complex, in the south side of &lt;a href=\"Kavarna\"&gt;Kavarna&lt;/a&gt;.
