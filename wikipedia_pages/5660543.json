The game was played in Raleigh, North Carolina. NCSU went on to defeat UCLA &amp; Marquette for the National title in Greensboro, North Carolina.\nKnight's performance during the 1973\u20131974 season, in which Pitt went 25-4 and won a school record, 22 games in a row, earned him 2nd team All-American team status. He is considered one of Pitt's best players ever and was voted to Pitt's all-time starting five.\nKnight had his number 34 jersey retired by the University of Pittsburgh on February 20, 1989.\nProfessional career.\nKnight spent 11 seasons, from 1974\u201385, in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;ABA&lt;/a&gt; and NBA as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20Pacers\"&gt;Indiana Pacers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Braves\"&gt;Buffalo Braves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Celtics\"&gt;Boston Celtics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Kings\"&gt;Kansas City Kings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20Spurs\"&gt;San Antonio Spurs&lt;/a&gt;. He scored 13,901 points in his ABA/NBA career and appeared in two &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;All-Star games&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnight's best years were with the Indiana Pacers, after being selected by both the Pacers and the LA Lakers in the player draft. Knight was voted 1st team ABA All-Star for the 1975\u20131976 season, his second year in the league after averaging 28.1 ppg. This was the last year of the ABA before the Indiana Pacers merged into the NBA. The following year Knight maintained All-Star status, this time in the NBA after averaging 26.6 ppg \u2014 second best in the league that season. After a brief stint with the Buffalo Braves &amp; Boston Celtics, Knight returned to the Pacers in 1978, where he continued his career with them until 1983.\nKnight is the Indiana Pacers 3rd all-time leading scorer and is in several other Top 5 all-time categories for the Pacers.\nPrior to joining the Hawks organization in 2002, Knight worked as a front office executive with the Pacers and the &lt;a href=\"Memphis%20Grizzlies\"&gt;Vancouver/Memphis Grizzlies&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnight's reign as GM of the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Hawks\"&gt;Atlanta Hawks&lt;/a&gt; was marred by poor drafts. In 2004, he drafted &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Childress\"&gt;Josh Childress&lt;/a&gt; over future All-Stars &lt;a href=\"Luol%20Deng\"&gt;Luol Deng&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andre%20Iguodala\"&gt;Andre Iguodala&lt;/a&gt;. Childress wound up leaving the Atlanta Hawks to join a Greek franchise. In 2005, Billy Knight drafted UNC freshman phenom &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Williams\"&gt;Marvin Williams&lt;/a&gt; over consensus top point guard and future 9-time All Star and 7-time All-NBA team &lt;a href=\"point%20guard\"&gt;point guard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Paul\"&gt;Chris Paul&lt;/a&gt; despite the roster's need for a point guard and glut of young players at the swing position between &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Childress\"&gt;Josh Childress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Smith\"&gt;Josh Smith&lt;/a&gt;. 2006 led to the selection of &lt;a href=\"Sheldon%20Williams\"&gt;Sheldon Williams&lt;/a&gt;, an undersized power forward, despite glaring needs at guard and future all-star &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Roy\"&gt;Brandon Roy&lt;/a&gt; available.\nOn May 7, 2008, Knight stepped down as Hawks GM. When announcing his resignation from the team he stated that he had left the Hawks \"in much better shape than it was in when I took over.\"\nPersonal life.\nKnight currently lives in Atlanta, and continues to play tennis, a game he enjoys and began playing around the age of 30."
