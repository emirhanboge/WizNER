Baltz (1923September 2011) was an American &lt;a href=\"soil%20scientist\"&gt;soil scientist&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nMary Baltz was the first woman soil scientist officially assigned in the field for the &lt;a href=\"Soil%20Conservation%20Service\"&gt;Soil Conservation Service&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter graduating from &lt;a href=\"Cornell%20University\"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;, Baltz joined the soil survey as a Junior Soil Surveyor in 1946 and later became a Survey Party Chief.\nLabor shortages during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; gave her the opportunity to work in a job that, up to that time, had been reserved for men. By 1951, Baltz was responsible for soil mapping on farms in &lt;a href=\"Madison%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Madison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oneida%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Oneida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20County%2C%20NY\"&gt;Lewis&lt;/a&gt; counties in the state of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, and was later assigned the task of map measurement for the entire state. The work was done by cutting out the soil map delineations on copies of the field sheets and then weighing the areas with the same label. The weight was later converted to &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBaltz hired the team of women to work with her in the winter months.\nShe worked for the until the 1960s.\nTrivia.\nMary Baltz was mentioned in a Forgotten Superheroes of Science section of &lt;a href=\"The%20Skeptics%27%20Guide%20to%20the%20Universe\"&gt;The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"podcast\"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;, episode #633."
