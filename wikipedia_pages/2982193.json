    "text": "The 2008 North Carolina gubernatorial election was held on November 4, 2008, coinciding with the &lt;a href=\"2008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election\"&gt;presidential&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2008%20United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2008%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%20in%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;U.S. House elections&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2008%20North%20Carolina%20Council%20of%20State%20elections\"&gt;Council of State&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"2008%20North%20Carolina%20judicial%20election\"&gt;statewide judicial elections&lt;/a&gt;. Democrat &lt;a href=\"Bev%20Perdue\"&gt;Bev Perdue&lt;/a&gt; won the election. With a margin of 3.39%, this election was the closest race of the &lt;a href=\"2008%20United%20States%20gubernatorial%20elections\"&gt;2008 gubernatorial election cycle&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause incumbent Governor &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Easley\"&gt;Mike Easley&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"term%20limit\"&gt;term-limited&lt;/a&gt;, the open-seat race was contested between Democrat &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Perdue\"&gt;Beverly Perdue&lt;/a&gt;, Republican &lt;a href=\"Pat%20McCrory\"&gt;Pat McCrory&lt;/a&gt;, and Libertarian &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Munger\"&gt;Michael Munger&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, Democrat &lt;a href=\"Walter%20H.%20Dalton\"&gt;Walter H. Dalton&lt;/a&gt;, Republican &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Pittenger\"&gt;Robert Pittenger&lt;/a&gt; and Libertarian Phillip Rhodes vied to replace term-limited Lt. Governor Perdue.\nPrimaries.\nCandidates Richard Moore, Dennis Nielsen, Robert Orr, and Bev Perdue took part in a forum on January 26, sponsored by the state chapter of the &lt;a href=\"NAACP\"&gt;NAACP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe statewide syndicated TV program, \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.ncspin.com/\"&gt;NC Spin&lt;/a&gt;\", held debates for both parties' candidates in April.\nDemocratic.\nCampaign.\nMoore and Nielsen appeared on the edition of \"NC Spin\" broadcast April 13 on most stations, but Perdue declined the invitation to participate. Perdue and Moore met for their final pre-primary debate at &lt;a href=\"WRAL-TV\"&gt;WRAL-TV&lt;/a&gt;, which was broadcast on several stations across the state on April 22.\nOn May 6, 2008, Perdue won the Democratic nomination for governor, defeating State Treasurer Moore and Nielsen.\nRepublican.\nCampaign.\nThe Raleigh \"&lt;a href=\"News%20%26amp%3B%20Observer\"&gt;News &amp; Observer&lt;/a&gt;\" reported on January 9, 2008 that McCrory had filed the necessary paperwork with the State Board of Elections to run for governor. He announced that he was running in his hometown of Jamestown on January 15, 2008.\nDebates.\nRepublican candidates Graham, Orr, and Smith held their first debate on October 20, 2007 at &lt;a href=\"High%20Point%20University\"&gt;High Point University&lt;/a&gt;. The two Democratic candidates held their first debate at the annual conference of the N.C. School Boards Association on Nov. 6, 2007, which hosted a Republican candidates' debate the same day.\n&lt;a href=\"UNC-TV\"&gt;UNC-TV&lt;/a&gt; invited the three announced Republican candidates and two announced Democratic candidates to participate in the campaign's first debates (officially called \"forums\") to air on statewide television. Each forum is intended to focus on a single topic: on Jan. 10, the state's economy; on Feb. 7, health care; and on April 24, education. Video of the forums is available on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20080423093345/http%3A//www.unctv.org/gubernatorial/index.html\"&gt;UNC-TV website&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Republican candidates, now joined by new challenger &lt;a href=\"Pat%20McCrory\"&gt;Pat McCrory&lt;/a&gt;, debated on &lt;a href=\"WRAL-TV\"&gt;WRAL-TV&lt;/a&gt; on January 17. The debate was also broadcast on stations in Charlotte and Wilmington.\nMcCrory, Orr, Graham, and Smith met in a televised debate held by &lt;a href=\"WTVI\"&gt;WTVI&lt;/a&gt; in Charlotte on April 3. Media accounts said that McCrory was the primary target of attacks by his rivals. The same was true at another &lt;a href=\"WRAL-TV\"&gt;WRAL-TV&lt;/a&gt; debate, held on April 15.\nThe final Republican debate before the primary was held in Asheville, and featured the only appearance by Elbie Powers in a debate.\nGeneral election.\nCandidates.\nIf he had been elected, McCrory would have been the first mayor of Charlotte to win the state's highest office.\nPolling.\nDespite a \"national Democratic tide\" and Perdue's fundraising edge, McCrory led Perdue at first; Perdue slowly gained with help from &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; as the Democratic presidential candidate. Perdue and McCrory remained close, with the two often polling in a statistical tie in what was the closest race for governor in the nation. Perdue ran slightly behind her opponent in polls released the week before the election. Pundits speculated that Perdue was hurt by current Democratic Governor &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Easley\"&gt;Mike Easley&lt;/a&gt;'s decreasing popularity due to the aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis, and McCrory's efforts to tag her as part of corruption in &lt;a href=\"Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Raleigh&lt;/a&gt;\u2014consultants mentioned Perdue's \"difficulty of being the candidate of continuity in a change election.\"\nCampaign.\nEarly in 2008, Libertarian nominee Munger called Perdue a \"&lt;a href=\"Stepford%20Wife\"&gt;Stepford Wife&lt;/a&gt;\" and said the Republican nominees were \"circus clowns.\" Prior to May 2008, the North Carolina Libertarian Party and Munger gathered 100,000 signatures of voters in order to qualify to appear on North Carolina's ballot. They, along with the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt;, sued the state unsuccessfully over the ballot access rules. Munger appeared as one of two keynote speakers at the national Libertarian convention in &lt;a href=\"Denver\"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt; in May 2008.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Hillary%20Clinton\"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; dropped out of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20presidential%20elections%2C%202008\"&gt;2008 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" mentioned Perdue as a potential pick for Obama's Vice President.\nMunger called himself \"the only &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20%28US%29\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; in the race.\" Munger took more &lt;a href=\"Social%20liberalism\"&gt;socially liberal&lt;/a&gt; positions on many issues than Democratic candidate Perdue. \"One reason I haven't been allowed in all the debates is that I'm taking votes from the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;. Sixty percent of my supporters are voting for Obama. I'll talk about &lt;a href=\"gay%20marriage\"&gt;gay marriage&lt;/a&gt;, and Perdue isn't, or doesn't want to.\" While Democratic candidate Perdue took a hard line on &lt;a href=\"illegal%20immigration\"&gt;illegal immigration&lt;/a&gt; similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pat%20McCrory\"&gt;Pat McCrory&lt;/a&gt;, Munger took a position more aligned with &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerdue raised $15 million and ran attack ads against McCrory, criticizing him for not being tough enough on &lt;a href=\"illegal%20immigration\"&gt;illegal immigration&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn October 2008, McCrory received the endorsement of most major newspapers in the state, which typically endorse Democrats. McCrory's candidacy for governor was endorsed by the \"&lt;a href=\"Raleigh%20News%20and%20Observer\"&gt;Raleigh News and Observer&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Charlotte%20Observer\"&gt;The Charlotte Observer&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Greensboro%20News%20%26amp%3B%20Record\"&gt;Greensboro News &amp; Record&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Winston-Salem%20Journal\"&gt;Winston-Salem Journal&lt;/a&gt;\", and the &lt;a href=\"UNC-Chapel%20Hill\"&gt;UNC-Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Daily%20Tar%20Heel\"&gt;Daily Tar Heel&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPerdue received the endorsement of actor and director &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Griffith\"&gt;Andy Griffith&lt;/a&gt;, who filmed a campaign ad on her behalf.\nPerdue defeated McCrory and Munger on November 4, 2008 to win the election.\nDebates.\nThe first general election debate between Perdue and McCrory was a forum at the North Carolina Bar Association meeting in &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Beach%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Atlantic Beach&lt;/a&gt; on June 21. The first debate between the two that was televised live was conducted by &lt;a href=\"WTVD\"&gt;WTVD&lt;/a&gt; on August 19. Another televised debate was held by &lt;a href=\"WRAL-TV\"&gt;WRAL-TV&lt;/a&gt; on September 9. Next, McCrory and Perdue met for a debate on education issues at &lt;a href=\"SAS%20Institute\"&gt;SAS Institute&lt;/a&gt; on September 19. The debate was sponsored by business and education groups and was covered by &lt;a href=\"News%2014%20Carolina\"&gt;News 14 Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Duke%20University\"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; professor and &lt;a href=\"Libertarian%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Libertarian&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Munger\"&gt;Michael Munger&lt;/a&gt; made history as the first third-party candidate to participate in a live, televised gubernatorial debate in North Carolina. He made his first debate appearance with McCrory on September 24 at &lt;a href=\"UNC-TV\"&gt;UNC-TV&lt;/a&gt;. Perdue declined to participate in that debate. All three candidates debated for the first time on October 15, in the final debate before the general election. The hour-long debate, sponsored by &lt;a href=\"WTVI\"&gt;WTVI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WSOC-TV\"&gt;WSOC-TV&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Women%20Voters\"&gt;League of Women Voters&lt;/a&gt;, aired in several television markets.\nAnalysts said that McCrory tended to perform better than Perdue in the debates, particularly in \"sit-down debates that allowed more back-and-forth between the candidates.\""
