    "text": "2.8\u00a0cm \"schwere Panzerb\u00fcchse\" 41 (sPzB 41) or \"Panzerb\u00fcchse 41\" was a &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; anti-tank weapon working on the &lt;a href=\"squeeze%20bore\"&gt;squeeze bore&lt;/a&gt; principle. Officially classified as a heavy &lt;a href=\"anti-tank%20rifle\"&gt;anti-tank rifle&lt;/a&gt; (German: \"schwere &lt;a href=\"Panzerb%C3%BCchse\"&gt;Panzerb\u00fcchse&lt;/a&gt;\"), it would be better described, and is widely referred to, as a light &lt;a href=\"anti-tank%20gun\"&gt;anti-tank gun&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nAlthough the sPzB 41 was classified as a heavy anti-tank rifle, its construction was much more typical of an anti-tank gun. Like the latter, it had a &lt;a href=\"recoil\"&gt;recoil&lt;/a&gt; mechanism, carriage and shield. The only significant feature the weapon had in common with anti-tank rifles was a lack of elevation and traverse mechanisms\u2014the light &lt;a href=\"Gun%20barrel\"&gt;barrel&lt;/a&gt; could be easily manipulated manually.\nThe design was based on a tapering barrel, with the caliber reducing from 28\u00a0mm at the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20%28weaponry%29\"&gt;chamber&lt;/a&gt; end to only 20\u00a0mm at the &lt;a href=\"Muzzle%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;muzzle&lt;/a&gt;. The projectile carried two external &lt;a href=\"flange\"&gt;flange&lt;/a&gt;s; as it proceeded toward the muzzle, the flanges were squeezed down, decreasing the diameter with the result that pressure did not drop off as quickly and the projectile was propelled to a higher velocity. The barrel construction resulted in a very high muzzle velocity - up to 1,400\u00a0m/s. The bore was fitted with a &lt;a href=\"muzzle%20brake\"&gt;muzzle brake&lt;/a&gt;. The horizontal sliding &lt;a href=\"breech%20block\"&gt;breech&lt;/a&gt; block was \"quarter-automatic\": it closed automatically once a shell was loaded, but unlike semi-automatic guns, the fired shell had to be manually ejected by opening the breech block. The gun was equipped with an open sight for distances up to 500m; a telescopic sight, the ZF 1\u044511 from the &lt;a href=\"3.7%20cm%20Pak%2036\"&gt;3.7 cm Pak 36&lt;/a&gt; anti-tank gun, could also be fitted.\nThe recoil system consisted of a &lt;a href=\"hydraulic\"&gt;hydraulic&lt;/a&gt; recoil buffer and spring-driven recuperator. The carriage was of the &lt;a href=\"Gun%20carriage%23Modern%20gun%20carriages\"&gt;split trail&lt;/a&gt; type, with suspension. Wheels with rubber tires could be removed, making the gun significantly lower and therefore easier to conceal; the process took 30\u201340 seconds. The guns' construction allowed toolless dismantling to five pieces, the heaviest of which weighed 62\u00a0kg.\nDevelopment and production history.\nThe cone-bore principle was first patented in 1903 by a German designer, Karl Puff. In the 1920s and 1930s, another German engineer, Gerlich, conducted experiments with coned-bore barrels that resulted in an experimental 7\u00a0mm anti-tank rifle with a muzzle velocity of 1,800\u00a0m/s.\nBased on these works, &lt;a href=\"Mauser\"&gt;Mauser-Werke AG&lt;/a&gt; developed a 28/20\u00a0mm anti-tank weapon initially designated \"Ger\u00e4t 231\" or \"MK.8202\" in 1939\u20131940. In June\u2013July 1940, an experimental batch of 94 (other sources say 30) pieces was given to the army for trials. They resulted in some modifications and in 1941 mass production of what became 2.8\u00a0cm schwere Panzerb\u00fcchse 41 started. One piece cost 4,520 &lt;a href=\"German%20reichsmark\"&gt;Reichsmarks&lt;/a&gt; (for the sake of comparison, one &lt;a href=\"Pak%2038\"&gt;5 cm Pak 38&lt;/a&gt; gun cost 10,600 Reichsmarks). The last gun was built in 1943; the main reason for the discontinuance was the lack of &lt;a href=\"tungsten\"&gt;tungsten&lt;/a&gt; for projectiles.\nOrganization and employment.\nThe sPzB 41 was used by some motorized &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;divisions&lt;/a&gt; and by some &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4ger%20%28military%29%23World%20War%20II\"&gt;J\u00e4ger (light infantry)&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Gebirgsj%C3%A4ger\"&gt;Gebirgsj\u00e4ger&lt;/a&gt;\" (mountain) and \"&lt;a href=\"Fallschirmj%C3%A4ger\"&gt;Fallschirmj\u00e4ger&lt;/a&gt;\" (paratrooper) units. Some guns were supplied to anti-tank and &lt;a href=\"sapper\"&gt;sapper&lt;/a&gt; units. The weapon was employed on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; from the beginning of hostilities (the \"Wehrmacht\" possessed 183 pieces on 1 June 1941), until the end of the war and also saw combat in the &lt;a href=\"North%20African%20Campaign\"&gt;North African Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; in 1944\u201345.\nSelf-propelled mounts.\nThe sPzB 41 was also mounted on several vehicles, such as cars, half-tracks and armored cars:\nService.\nSqueeze bore guns saw only limited use in World War II. Manufacturing such weapons was impossible without advanced technologies and high production standards. Besides Germany, the only country to bring such weapons to mass production was Britain, with the &lt;a href=\"Littlejohn%20adaptor\"&gt;Littlejohn adaptor&lt;/a&gt; which, although not a gun in itself, used the same principle. An attempt by a Soviet design bureau headed by &lt;a href=\"Vasiliy%20Grabin\"&gt;V. G. Grabin&lt;/a&gt; in 1940, failed because of technological problems. In the US, reports about the sPzB 41 inspired a series of experiments with 28/20 barrels and taper bore adaptors for the &lt;a href=\"M3%2037%20mm%20gun\"&gt;37\u00a0mm Gun M3&lt;/a&gt;; the work started in September 1941 and continued throughout the war, with no practical success.\nThe sPzB 41 combined good anti-armor performance at short range (for example, at least once a shot penetrated the lower front plate of the heavy &lt;a href=\"Iosif%20Stalin%20tank\"&gt;IS-1&lt;/a&gt;) and a high rate of fire with small, lightweight (for anti-tank gun), dismantleable construction.\nHowever, it also had several shortcomings, such as:\nSome authors that criticize the sPzB 41 concentrate mainly on the short service life of its barrel. However, its chance of survival after 500 short-range shots was slim anyway. High-velocity guns with \"normal\" barrel construction also had a short service life, e.g. for the Soviet 57-mm &lt;a href=\"ZiS-2\"&gt;ZiS-2&lt;/a&gt; it was about 1,000 shots. In the end, the factor that brought production of the sPzB 41 to a halt was the shortage of tungsten.\nAmmunition.\nThere were two shell types for the sPzB 41: the armor-piercing \"2.8\u00a0cm Pzgr.41\" and the fragmentation \"2.8\u00a0cm Sprg.41\".\nThe Pzgr.41 had a &lt;a href=\"tungsten%20carbide\"&gt;tungsten carbide&lt;/a&gt; core, a softer steel casing and a &lt;a href=\"magnesium\"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; alloy ballistic cap. The core was 40\u00a0mm long and 10.9\u00a0mm in diameter."
