    "text": "This is a list of &lt;a href=\"college%20rivalries\"&gt;college rivalries&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.\nSchool rivalries are important in the United States, especially in &lt;a href=\"college%20athletics\"&gt;intercollegiate sports&lt;/a&gt;. Rivalries within conferences are list below. Some rivalries, such as the &lt;a href=\"Indiana%E2%80%93Kentucky%20rivalry\"&gt;Indiana\u2013Kentucky rivalry&lt;/a&gt;, take place between two schools from different conferences.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Caltech%E2%80%93MIT%20rivalry\"&gt;Caltech\u2013MIT rivalry&lt;/a&gt; is unusual for both the geographic distance between the schools (their campuses are separated by about 2500 miles and are on &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;opposite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;coasts&lt;/a&gt; of the United States) and the focus on elaborate &lt;a href=\"prank\"&gt;prank&lt;/a&gt;s rather than sporting events.\nBy athletic conference.\nACC rivalries.\n&lt;a href=\"College%20basketball\"&gt;Basketball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"College%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; are typically the hot-button sports in the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; (ACC), though most rivalries bridge across all sports. The most notable rivalries include:\nAmerica East rivalries.\nBasketball is typically the hot-button sport in the &lt;a href=\"America%20East%20Conference\"&gt;America East Conference&lt;/a&gt;, though most rivalries bridge across all sports. The most notable rivalries include:\nBig East rivalries.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Big%20East%20Conference\"&gt;Big East Conference&lt;/a&gt;, founded as a &lt;a href=\"college%20basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; conference, is a league of 11 &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;Division I&lt;/a&gt; schools, with only UConn playing &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20Football%20Bowl%20Subdivision\"&gt;FBS&lt;/a&gt;\u2013level &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;. The conference, while centered in the northeast, is also geographically diverse, stretching from Nebraska to New England. Current rivalries include:\nBig Ten rivalries.\nUniversities in the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference\"&gt;Big Ten Conference&lt;/a&gt; in the Midwest have more rivalries than Universities in the Southeast.\nBig 12 rivalries.\nCurrent rivalries in the &lt;a href=\"Big%2012%20Conference\"&gt;Big 12 Conference&lt;/a&gt; include:\nOther current rivalries involving Big 12 schools include:\nFormer Big 12 rivalries that are now dormant due to &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9314%20NCAA%20conference%20realignment\"&gt;conference realignment in the early 2010s&lt;/a&gt; include:\nColonial Athletic Association rivalries.\nRivalries in the &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;Colonial Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (CAA) include:\nIvy League and service academy rivalries.\nRivalries between and among the &lt;a href=\"Ivy%20League\"&gt;Ivy League&lt;/a&gt; schools and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Service%20academies\"&gt;service academies&lt;/a&gt; include:\nPac-12 rivalries.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pac-12%20Conference\"&gt;Pac-12 Conference&lt;/a&gt; falls neatly into six regional pairings, leading to strong natural rivalries. Three of these pairs are cross-state rivals, one pair is within the same metropolitan region (&lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area\"&gt;San Francisco Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;), and one pair vies for bragging rights within the same city (Los Angeles).\nOther Pac-12 rivalries:\nAdditional non-conference rivalries involving Pac-12 schools (the most famous of which is arguably Notre Dame-Southern California) can be found in other sections of this article.\nSEC rivalries.\nRivalries in the &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Conference\"&gt;Southeastern Conference&lt;/a&gt; (SEC) include:\nNotre Dame rivalries.\nThe &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Notre%20Dame\"&gt;University of Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; (an &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20independent%20schools\"&gt;independent in football&lt;/a&gt;) has numerous &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; rivals, the most notable of which include:\nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Notre Dame men's basketball&lt;/a&gt; has traditional rivalries with &lt;a href=\"DePaul%20Blue%20Demons%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;DePaul University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marquette%20Golden%20Eagles%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Marquette University&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"UCLA%20Bruins%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; when each of the programs met regularly and were national contenders. &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20women%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Notre Dame women's basketball&lt;/a&gt; has developed &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%E2%80%93UConn%20women%27s%20basketball%20rivalry\"&gt;a nationally significant rivalry&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"UConn%20Huskies%20women%27s%20basketball\"&gt;University of Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Bird%20at%20the%20Buzzer\"&gt;a published book&lt;/a&gt; focusing on one specific matchup.\nBy region.\nSoutheastern rivalries.\nUniversities in the Southeastern U.S., including those in the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; (ACC), &lt;a href=\"Conference%20USA\"&gt;Conference USA&lt;/a&gt; (C-USA), &lt;a href=\"Mid-Eastern%20Athletic%20Conference\"&gt;Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference&lt;/a&gt; (MEAC), &lt;a href=\"Southwestern%20Athletic%20Conference\"&gt;Southwestern Athletic Conference&lt;/a&gt; (SWAC), &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Conference\"&gt;Southeastern Conference&lt;/a&gt; (SEC), &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Conference\"&gt;Southern Conference&lt;/a&gt; (SoCon), &lt;a href=\"Southland%20Conference\"&gt;Southland Conference&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Belt%20Conference\"&gt;Sun Belt Conference&lt;/a&gt;, have perhaps the most complex jumble of rivalries, many associated with annual football games, and often with colorful nicknames:\nOld Southeastern rivalries seldom played due to conference obligations, divisional changes etc.:\nTexas rivalries.\nThese rivalries involve Texas schools that are not currently members of the &lt;a href=\"Big%2012%20Conference\"&gt;Big 12 Conference&lt;/a&gt;. In two of these rivalries, both sides involved were members of the old &lt;a href=\"Southwest%20Conference\"&gt;Southwest Conference&lt;/a&gt;, four of whose schools were founding members of the Big 12. Another rivalry involves an old SWC team against an Oklahoma rival."
