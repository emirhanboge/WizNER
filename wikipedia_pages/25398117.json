    "text": "Eric Charles Milner, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20of%20Canada\"&gt;FRSC&lt;/a&gt; (May 17, 1928 \u2013 July 20, 1997) was a &lt;a href=\"mathematician\"&gt;mathematician&lt;/a&gt; who worked mainly in &lt;a href=\"combinatorics\"&gt;combinatorial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"set%20theory\"&gt;set theory&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBorn into a South East London working-class family, Milner was sent to a &lt;a href=\"Reading%2C%20Berkshire\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt; boarding school for the war but, hating it, ran away and roamed the streets of London. Eventually, another school was found for him; Milner attended &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20College%20London\"&gt;King's College London&lt;/a&gt; starting in 1946, where he competed as a &lt;a href=\"featherweight\"&gt;featherweight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boxing\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated in 1949 as the best mathematics student in his year, and received a master's degree in 1950 under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Rado\"&gt;Richard Rado&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Coulson\"&gt;Charles Coulson&lt;/a&gt;. Partial deafness prevented him from joining the Navy, and instead, in 1951, he took a position with the &lt;a href=\"Straits%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Straits Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Metallurgical%20assay\"&gt;assaying&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tin\"&gt;tin&lt;/a&gt;. Soon thereafter he joined the mathematics faculty at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Malaya\"&gt;University of Malaya&lt;/a&gt; in Singapore, where &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Oppenheim\"&gt;Alexander Oppenheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richard%20K.%20Guy\"&gt;Richard K. Guy&lt;/a&gt; were already working. In 1958, Milner took a sabbatical at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Reading\"&gt;University of Reading&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1961 he took a lecturership there and began his doctoral studies; he obtained a Ph.D. from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20London\"&gt;University of London&lt;/a&gt; in 1963. He joined his former Singapore colleagues Guy and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Lancaster\"&gt;Peter Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; as a professor at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Calgary\"&gt;University of Calgary&lt;/a&gt; in 1967, where he was head of the mathematics department from 1976 to 1980. In 1973, he became a Canadian citizen, and in 1976 he became a fellow of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Royal Society of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. In 1974 he was a Plenary Speaker of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Congress%20of%20Mathematicians\"&gt;International Congress of Mathematicians&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vancouver\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1954, while in Singapore, Milner married Esther Stella (Estelle) Lawton, whom he had known as a London student; they had four children who were Paul Milner, Mark Milner, Suzanne Milner, and Simon Milner. Estelle died of cancer in 1975, and in 1979 Milner married Elizabeth Forsyth Borthwick, with whom he had his son Robert Milner.\nResearch.\nMilner's interest in set theory was sparked by visits of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Erd%C5%91s\"&gt;Paul Erd\u0151s&lt;/a&gt; to Singapore and by meeting &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A1s%20Hajnal\"&gt;Andr\u00e1s Hajnal&lt;/a&gt; while on sabbatical in Reading.\nHe generalized &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Chung%20Chang\"&gt;Chen Chung Chang&lt;/a&gt;'s ordinal partition theorem (expressed in the &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20notation%20%28Ramsey%20theory%29\"&gt;arrow notation&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Ramsey%20theory\"&gt;Ramsey theory&lt;/a&gt;) \u03c9\u03c9\u2192(\u03c9\u03c9,3)2 to \u03c9\u03c9\u2192(\u03c9\u03c9,\"k\")2 for arbitrary finite \"k\". He is also known for the &lt;a href=\"Milner%E2%80%93Rado%20paradox\"&gt;Milner\u2013Rado paradox&lt;/a&gt;. He has 15 joint papers with Paul Erd\u0151s."
