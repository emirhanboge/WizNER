    "text": "The Commitments is a &lt;a href=\"musical%20theatre\"&gt;musical&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=\"Roddy%20Doyle\"&gt;Roddy Doyle&lt;/a&gt;, based on the &lt;a href=\"The%20Commitments%20%28novel%29\"&gt;1987 novel of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, also written by Doyle. Like the novel (and &lt;a href=\"The%20Commitments%20%28film%29\"&gt;its 1991 film adaptation&lt;/a&gt;), the musical is about a group of unemployed Irish youths who start a &lt;a href=\"soul%20music\"&gt;soul music&lt;/a&gt; band. It premiered in 2013 at the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20Theatre%2C%20London\"&gt;Palace Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"West%20End%20theatre\"&gt;West End&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe music within the musical consists of soul and &lt;a href=\"rock%20%26amp%3B%20roll\"&gt;rock &amp; roll&lt;/a&gt; classics from the 1950s and 60s, including \"&lt;a href=\"Think%20%28Aretha%20Franklin%20song%29\"&gt;Think&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"%28I%20Can%27t%20Get%20No%29%20Satisfaction\"&gt;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Papa%20Was%20a%20Rollin%27%20Stone\"&gt;Papa Was a Rollin' Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20Train%20%28composition%29%23James%20Brown%20version\"&gt;Night Train&lt;/a&gt;\". The music is entirely &lt;a href=\"diegetic%20music\"&gt;diegetic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that all the songs are performed by the band rather than being sung by characters to express an emotion. For that reason, Doyle has insisted that \"The Commitments\" is not a &lt;a href=\"jukebox%20musical\"&gt;jukebox musical&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe musical is based on the &lt;a href=\"The%20Commitments%20%28novel%29\"&gt;1987 novel&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=\"Roddy%20Doyle\"&gt;Roddy Doyle&lt;/a&gt;. Following the 1991 film adaptation, Doyle said he received 20 different offers to turn the novel into a musical. He turned them all down because he had become resentful of the success of \"The Commitments\", to the seeming exclusion of his other novels; and because he was not a fan of musical theatre, having never seen a musical. He eventually changed his mind due to his children, who were fans of the 1991 film, and who took him to see musicals, including a production of the film-turned-musical \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Producers%20%28musical%29\"&gt;The Producers&lt;/a&gt;\", which he called \"a revelation\".\nOfficially confirmed on 19 April 2013, in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, producers announced that the show would play the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20Theatre%2C%20London\"&gt;Palace Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, with tickets going on sale everywhere on 23 April. Despite initially looking to hire another writer to write the book for the musical, Doyle ended up writing the show himself. The show will be directed by &lt;a href=\"Jamie%20Lloyd%20%28director%29\"&gt;Jamie Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;, with choreography by Ann Yee, set design by Soutra Gilmour, sound design by Rory Madden and lightning by Jon Clark.
