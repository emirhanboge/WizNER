    "text": "Labor aristocracy &lt;a href=\"American%20and%20British%20English%20spelling%20differences%23-our%2C%20-or\"&gt;or&lt;/a&gt; labour aristocracy (also aristocracy of labor) has at least four meanings: (1) as a term with &lt;a href=\"Marxist\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; theoretical underpinnings; (2) as a specific type of &lt;a href=\"trade%20unionism\"&gt;trade unionism&lt;/a&gt;; (3) as a shorthand description by revolutionary &lt;a href=\"industrial%20unions\"&gt;industrial unions&lt;/a&gt; (such as the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Industrial Workers of the World&lt;/a&gt;) for the bureaucracy of craft-based &lt;a href=\"business%20unionism\"&gt;business unionism&lt;/a&gt;; and (4) in the 19th and early 20th centuries was also a phrase used to define better-off members of the working class (as used for example by &lt;a href=\"Jack%20London\"&gt;Jack London&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20People%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;The People of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt;\").\nUse within Marxism.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Marxist%20theory\"&gt;Marxist theory&lt;/a&gt;, those workers (&lt;a href=\"proletariat\"&gt;proletarians&lt;/a&gt;) in the &lt;a href=\"Developed%20country\"&gt;developed countries&lt;/a&gt; who benefit from the &lt;a href=\"superprofit\"&gt;superprofit&lt;/a&gt;s extracted from the impoverished workers of &lt;a href=\"developing%20country\"&gt;developing countries&lt;/a&gt; form an \"aristocracy of labor\". The phrase was popularized by &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Kautsky\"&gt;Karl Kautsky&lt;/a&gt; in 1901 and theorized by &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Lenin\"&gt;Vladimir Lenin&lt;/a&gt; in his treatise \"&lt;a href=\"Imperialism%2C%20the%20Highest%20Stage%20of%20Capitalism\"&gt;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;\". According to Lenin, companies in the developed world &lt;a href=\"Exploitation%20of%20labour\"&gt;exploit&lt;/a&gt; workers in the &lt;a href=\"developing%20world\"&gt;developing world&lt;/a&gt; where wages are much lower. The increased profits enable these companies to pay higher wages to their employees \"at home\" (that is, in the developed world), thus creating a &lt;a href=\"working%20class\"&gt;working class&lt;/a&gt; satisfied with their &lt;a href=\"standard%20of%20living\"&gt;standard of living&lt;/a&gt; and not inclined to &lt;a href=\"proletarian%20revolution\"&gt;proletarian revolution&lt;/a&gt;. It is a form of exporting poverty, creating an \"&lt;a href=\"exclave\"&gt;exclave&lt;/a&gt;\" of lower social class. Lenin contended that &lt;a href=\"imperialism\"&gt;imperialism&lt;/a&gt; had prevented increasing class polarization in the developed world and argued that a workers' revolution could only begin in one of the developing countries, such as &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe concept of a labor aristocracy is controversial between Marxists. While the theory is formally shared by most currents that identify positively with Lenin, including the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20International\"&gt;Communist International&lt;/a&gt;, few organizations place the theory at the center of their work. The term is most widely used in the United States, where it was popularized in the decade prior to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20V.%20Debs\"&gt;Eugene V. Debs&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Party%20of%20America\"&gt;Socialist Party of America&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Industrial Workers of the World&lt;/a&gt;. In Britain, those who hold to this theory include the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain%20%28Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist%29\"&gt;Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist\u2013Leninist)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Communist%20Group%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Revolutionary Communist Group&lt;/a&gt;. Many &lt;a href=\"Trotskyism\"&gt;Trotskyists&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Leon%20Trotsky\"&gt;Leon Trotsky&lt;/a&gt; himself and the early congresses of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20International\"&gt;Fourth International&lt;/a&gt; have accepted the theory of the labor aristocracy whereas others, including &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Mandel\"&gt;Ernest Mandel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Cliff\"&gt;Tony Cliff&lt;/a&gt;, considered the theory to have mistaken arguments or \"&lt;a href=\"Third-Worldism\"&gt;Third Worldist&lt;/a&gt;\" implications.\nAlbanian leader and Marxist &lt;a href=\"Enver%20Hoxha\"&gt;Enver Hoxha&lt;/a&gt; gave the following explanation for the development of the labor aristocracy following &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;: \nCriticism of business unions of workers.\nThe term was originally coined by &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Bakunin\"&gt;Mikhail Bakunin&lt;/a&gt; in 1872 as a criticism of the notion that organized workers are the most radical. Bakunin wrote: \"To me the flower of the proletariat is not, as it is to the Marxists, the upper layer, the aristocracy of labor, those who are the most cultured, who earn more and live more comfortably than all the other workers\".\nIn the United States and Britain, the term \"aristocracy of labor\" is used as an implicit criticism of &lt;a href=\"labor%20unions\"&gt;labor unions&lt;/a&gt; that have organized high-salary workers and have no interest in unionizing middle-income and lower-income employees\u2014even in cases where organizing the unorganized would strengthen the unions involved. These unions, it is argued, are content to remain a \"labor aristocracy\". Examples might include the unions of professional athletes, which have raised the wages of a certain class of already highly paid workers\u2014professional athletes\u2014but refuse to organize other workers, including other employees of the teams they work for. It commonly charged that the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Line%20Pilots%20Association%2C%20International\"&gt;Air Line Pilots Association, International&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Screen%20Actors%20Guild\"&gt;Screen Actors Guild&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of other &lt;a href=\"AFL%E2%80%93CIO\"&gt;AFL\u2013CIO&lt;/a&gt; unions conform to the labor aristocracy model of trade unionism.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century in the United States, \"most &lt;a href=\"American%20Federation%20of%20Labor\"&gt;American Federation of Labor&lt;/a&gt; (AFL) unions did not admit unskilled mass-production workers\". Selig Perlman wrote in 1923 that skilled workers organized into craft unions were more interested in trade separatism than in labor solidarity. The craft workers were capable of demanding more from their employers due to their skills and preferred to fight separately from unskilled or semiskilled workers. In Perlman's words, the trade unions declared that their purpose was \"to protect the skilled trades of America from being reduced to beggary\".\nIn 1905, many existing unions actively lobbied for racist and anti-immigration policies through the creation of the notorious &lt;a href=\"Asiatic%20Exclusion%20League\"&gt;Asiatic Exclusion League&lt;/a&gt;. That same year, a new union called the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was formed in Chicago. The IWW, also known as the Wobblies, differed from the AFL in significant ways:\nFrom its inception in 1905, the IWW criticized existing craft unions for creating a \"labor aristocracy\". &lt;a href=\"Eugene%20V.%20Debs\"&gt;Eugene V. Debs&lt;/a&gt; wrote that \"seasoned old unionists\" could see that working people could not win with the labor movement they had. Debs believed the AFL practiced \"organized scabbery\" of one union on another, engaged in jurisdictional squabbling, was dominated by an autocratic leadership and the relationship between union leaders and millionaires in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Civic%20Federation\"&gt;National Civic Federation&lt;/a&gt; was much too cozy. IWW leaders believed that in the AFL there was too little solidarity and too little \"straight\" labor education. These circumstances led to too little appreciation of what could be won, and too little will to win it.\nAnimated by a class philosophy that saw capitalism as an economic system dividing society into two classes\u2014those who own, manage, or rule; and those who have only their labor to sell\u2014the IWW declared:[...] the working class and the employing class have nothing in common. [...] Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the toilers [...] take and hold that which they produce by their labor through an economic organization of the working class.\nIn contrast, the AFL declared: We have no ultimate ends. We are going only from day to day. We are fighting only for immediate objects\u2014objects that can be realized in a few years [...] we say in our constitution that we are opposed to theorists [...] we are all practical men.\nLabor historian &lt;a href=\"Melvyn%20Dubofsky\"&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky&lt;/a&gt; has written the following: By 1896 &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Gompers\"&gt;Gompers&lt;/a&gt; and the AFL were moving to make their peace with Capitalism and the American system. Although the AFL had once preached the inevitability of class conflict and the need to abolish '&lt;a href=\"wage%20slavery\"&gt;wage slavery&lt;/a&gt;', it slowly and almost imperceptibly began to proclaim the virtues of class harmony and the possibilities of a more benevolent Capitalism.\nThe AFL therefore preached \"pure and simple\" trade unionism. The AFL concerned itself with a \"philosophy of pure wage consciousness\", according to &lt;a href=\"Selig%20Perlman\"&gt;Selig Perlman&lt;/a&gt;, who developed the \"business unionism\" theory of labor. Perlman saw craft organizing as a means of resisting the encroachment of waves of immigrants. Organization that was based upon craft skills granted control over access to the job.\nWhile craft unions provided a good defense for the privileges of membership, conventions such as time-limited contracts and pledges not to strike in solidarity with other workers severely limited the ability of craft unions to effect change in society at large, leaving only the ineffectual means granted by a business-dominated elite society, i.e. electoral politics, lobbying congress and a newly enfeebled economic weapon, the injunction-circumscribed strike. However, the AFL embraced this \"businesslike\" and \"pragmatic\" worldview, adopting the motto \"A fair day's wage for a fair day's work\".\nThe AFL outlived the class consciousness of its own founding Preamble, but the IWW embraced the goal of abolishing &lt;a href=\"wage%20slavery\"&gt;wage slavery&lt;/a&gt;. In 1908, the IWW responded to what it considered the AFL's &lt;a href=\"class%20collaboration\"&gt;class collaboration&lt;/a&gt;ist tendencies with new wording in the IWW Preamble: Instead of the conservative motto, \"A fair day's wage for a fair day's work,\" we must inscribe upon our banner the revolutionary watchword, \"Abolition of the wage system.\" [...] The army of production must be organized, not only for the every-day struggle with capitalists, but also to carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown.\nThe IWW saw itself as the answer to the conservatism of the AFL. The IWW &lt;a href=\"Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World%20philosophy%20and%20tactics\"&gt;developed a variety of creative tactics&lt;/a&gt; in its effort to \"build a new world within the shell of the old\". Because the AFL declined to act as an ally in such a cause, the Wobblies sought to develop solidarity with all rank and file workers while criticizing or &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Block\"&gt;spoofing&lt;/a&gt; AFL union leadership. AFL union \"bosses\" were (and still are) referred to by the Wobblies as \"&lt;a href=\"Wobbly%20lingo%23Piecard\"&gt;piecards&lt;/a&gt;\". To the IWW, all the union bureaucracy of the AFL functioned pretty much as a \"labor aristocracy\". In that regard, the IWW's views have not changed much over the years.\nMainstream unions have evolved, embracing some of the principles of industrial unionism and (in many cases) opening their doors to a greater spectrum of the working class. However, there are many aspects to business unionism that solidarity unionists still find suspect\u2013 a tendency to operate as a business, rather than according to \"union principles\"; enthroning elite hierarchies of leadership which are not easily recalled by the membership; deriving significant income from the sale of insurance or credit cards, arguably leading to conflicts of interest; union leadership compensation levels that are closer to those of corporate executives than of rank and file workers; top-down decision making; and building relationships with the leadership of corporations or political parties that the rank and file may view with suspicion.\nAll union movements function in some fashion to raise up workers in social/economic status and/or in union privilege. The significant difference between a union movement with a labor aristocracy and a union movement based upon class solidarity is how and to what extent the structure, bureaucracy and in particular policies and practices of that union movement function, either to leave that level of increased privilege as the \"status quo\", or to recognize the necessity of building structural relationships, promoting education and engaging in solidarity activities with the specific intention of translating gains into an effort to enhance the status of all working people."
