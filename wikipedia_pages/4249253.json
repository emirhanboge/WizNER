    "text": "Gilbert Colin Myles (born 18 October 1945) is a former &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Politics\"&gt;New Zealand politician&lt;/a&gt; who entered Parliament for the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20National%20Party\"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt; in 1990, then split from the party in 1991 and sat as an independent, before representing the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Liberal%20Party%20%281991%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%28New%20Zealand%20political%20party%29\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20First\"&gt;New Zealand First&lt;/a&gt; party.\nEarly life and family.\nBorn in Scotland on 18 October 1945 to David Myles and Janet Duncan, Myles came to New Zealand with his family as an infant. He was educated at &lt;a href=\"Papanui%20High%20School\"&gt;Papanui High School&lt;/a&gt;. In 1971 Myles married Colleen Kirker, and the couple had two children.\nMember of Parliament.\nHe was elected to &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Parliament\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; for the seat of &lt;a href=\"Roskill%20%28New%20Zealand%20electorate%29\"&gt;Roskill&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1990%20New%20Zealand%20general%20election\"&gt;1990 election&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20National%20Party\"&gt;New Zealand National Party&lt;/a&gt;, a previously safe-seat of the previously ruling &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28New%20Zealand%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, largely on a platform of opposition to the \"&lt;a href=\"Rogernomics\"&gt;Rogernomics&lt;/a&gt;\" economic reforms that had occurred during the 1980s in New Zealand. He openly identified with the pro-&lt;a href=\"government%20intervention\"&gt;interventionist&lt;/a&gt; '&lt;a href=\"Robert%20Muldoon\"&gt;Muldoonist&lt;/a&gt;' faction of the National Party, once saying \"I joined the National Party because of Sir Robert Muldoon\". His campaign slogan was \"Let's rescue Roskill\".\nMyles, however, quickly fell out with the leadership of the National Party (that had simultaneously become the Government) due to the party's own swing toward &lt;a href=\"privatisation\"&gt;privatisation&lt;/a&gt; and the slashing of the Government's expenditure on &lt;a href=\"social%20policy\"&gt;social policy&lt;/a&gt; enthusiastically implemented by &lt;a href=\"Finance%20Minister\"&gt;Finance Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ruth%20Richardson\"&gt;Ruth Richardson&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Ruthanasia\"&gt;Ruthanasia&lt;/a&gt;). His disgust with the continuation of these reforms by Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Bolger\"&gt;Jim Bolger&lt;/a&gt; led to his identification with the rebels within the National Party, like &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Laws\"&gt;Michael Laws&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Peters\"&gt;Winston Peters&lt;/a&gt;, who together had major confrontations with the dominant neo-liberals within the party's relatively gargantuan &lt;a href=\"caucus\"&gt;caucus&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiberal Party.\nEventually, the total breakdown of relations between Myles and the majority of the Government led to him and another dissident, &lt;a href=\"Hamish%20MacIntyre\"&gt;Hamish MacIntyre&lt;/a&gt;, breaking away to become independents in late 1991 and then proceeding to form the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Liberal%20Party%20%281991%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; in 1991. The party failed to gain significant popular support, with the problem being that neither of the two MPs of the party had any significant political experience but also the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"left%20wing\"&gt;left wing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%28New%20Zealand%20political%20party%29\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; party and Winston Peters continuing to criticise National from within. In June 1992 the Liberal Party joined the Alliance and Myles became an Alliance MP. At the Alliance's inaugural party conference in November 1992 Myles put himself forward for a position of one of the Alliance's deputy leaders but was beaten by &lt;a href=\"Sandra%20Lee-Vercoe\"&gt;Sandra Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jeanette%20Fitzsimons\"&gt;Jeanette Fitzsimons&lt;/a&gt; in a delegate ballot.\nMyles instigated a political scandal when in September 1992 he accused former Labour MP &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Gerbic\"&gt;Fred Gerbic&lt;/a&gt; of operating a &lt;a href=\"Graft%20%28politics%29\"&gt;graft&lt;/a&gt; while he was a minister. Myles, under &lt;a href=\"Parliamentary%20privilege\"&gt;Parliamentary privilege&lt;/a&gt;, alleged that Gerbic took financial donations in exchange for residency approvals in his capacity as associate Minister of Immigration and in support tabled a transcript of an alleged tape recorded conversation between two Auckland Labour Party members. In response Gerbic denied the allegations and maintained his innocence throughout. The claims were investigated by &lt;a href=\"John%20McGrath%20%28judge%29\"&gt;John McGrath&lt;/a&gt; QC who found no evidence of impropriety by Gerbic and dismissed Myles' claims.\nNew Zealand First.\nDuring 1993, the Liberal Party merged with the much larger and far more left wing &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%28New%20Zealand%20political%20party%29\"&gt;Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt;. Myles proceeded to quit the grouping within months in July, particularly over his somewhat &lt;a href=\"Social%20conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; social values conflicting with the highly socially liberal policies of the Alliance. He immediately joined the &lt;a href=\"populism\"&gt;populist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20First\"&gt;New Zealand First&lt;/a&gt; party, founded by the now Independent Winston Peters. However he lost his seat during the &lt;a href=\"1993%20New%20Zealand%20general%20election\"&gt;1993 election&lt;/a&gt;.\nMyles re-entered parliament for a brief period during 1999, following the total breakdown of the New Zealand First \u2013 National &lt;a href=\"coalition%20government\"&gt;coalition government&lt;/a&gt; and the resignation of former NZ First MP turned Independent minister in the National government &lt;a href=\"Deborah%20Morris\"&gt;Deborah Morris&lt;/a&gt; over the prioritisation of military expenditure over social expenditure in the 1999 budget. Some controversy emerged as Morris issued a &lt;a href=\"Tape%20recorder\"&gt;tape&lt;/a&gt;-recorded &lt;a href=\"telephone\"&gt;telephone&lt;/a&gt; conversation between her and Myles where he admitted that he would immediately quit NZ First upon arrival in Parliament and would support the struggling &lt;a href=\"Jenny%20Shipley\"&gt;Jenny Shipley&lt;/a&gt;-led National Government (This did not end up occurring, following threats of discipline by Peters and other NZ First party members).\nLife after politics.\nMyles was not re-elected in the election later that year and retired from active politics.\nIn 2011 he was found guilty on a charge of obstructing the course of justice for faking a receipt book while under investigation for fraud. He was found not guilty on the fraud charges. For the obstruction of justice charge, he was sentenced to community detention and community work. Myles has since resigned as a Justice of the Peace."
