    "text": "Fish-shaped pastry refers to the Japanese pastry &lt;a href=\"Taiyaki\"&gt;Taiyaki&lt;/a&gt;, which is shaped to resemble a &lt;a href=\"bream\"&gt;bream&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Asian%20carp\"&gt;Asian carp&lt;/a&gt;, and then is filled with &lt;a href=\"red%20bean%20paste\"&gt;red bean paste&lt;/a&gt; or other fillings like custard or chocolate. It is derived from the similar Japanese pastry called &lt;a href=\"Imagawayaki\"&gt;Imagawayaki&lt;/a&gt;. It is also popular in other East Asian countries such as: South Korea where it is known as &lt;a href=\"bungeoppang\"&gt;bungeoppang&lt;/a&gt;."
