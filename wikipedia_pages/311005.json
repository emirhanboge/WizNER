    "text": "Christian\u2212Jewish reconciliation refers to the efforts that are being made to improve understanding and acceptance between &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt;. There has been significant progress in reconciliation in recent years, in particular by the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, but also by other &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; groups.\nBackground.\nIn response to &lt;a href=\"the%20Holocaust\"&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; (though earlier accounts of reconciliation exist), and many other instances of the persecution of Jews by Christians throughout history (most prominent being the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20and%20the%20Crusades\"&gt;Crusades&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Inquisition\"&gt;Inquisition&lt;/a&gt;), many Christian theologians, religious historians and educators have sought to improve understanding of Judaism and Jewish religious practices by Christians.\nThere are a number of sensitive issues that continue to impact Christian-Jewish relations.\nProselytism.\nAttempts by Christians to convert Jews to Christianity is an important issue in Christian-Jewish relations. Groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Defamation%20League\"&gt;Anti-Defamation League&lt;/a&gt; have described many attempts to &lt;a href=\"Conversion%20of%20the%20Jews\"&gt;convert Jews&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"anti-semitic\"&gt;anti-semitic&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that the church should not be targeting Jews for conversion efforts, since \"Israel is in the hands of God, who will save it 'as a whole' at the proper time.\" A number of &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Christianity\"&gt;Progressive Christian&lt;/a&gt; denominations have publicly declared that they will no longer proselytize Jews. Other &lt;a href=\"Mainline%20%28Protestant%29\"&gt;mainline Christian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Confessionalism%20%28religion%29\"&gt;conservative Christian&lt;/a&gt; churches have said they will continue their efforts to evangelize among Jews, saying that this is not anti-semitic.\nA 2008 survey of &lt;a href=\"Christianity%20in%20America\"&gt;American Christians&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Pew%20Forum%20on%20Religion%20and%20Public%20Life\"&gt;Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life&lt;/a&gt; found that over 60% of most &lt;a href=\"Christian%20denomination\"&gt;denominations&lt;/a&gt; believe that Jews will receive &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20life%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;eternal life&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"human%20death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; alongside Christians.\nRoman Catholicism.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Second%20Vatican%20Council\"&gt;Second Vatican Council&lt;/a&gt;, commonly known as \"Vatican II\", which closed in 1965, was instrumental in producing the document called \"&lt;a href=\"Nostra%20aetate\"&gt;Nostra aetate&lt;/a&gt;\", which read in part:\nTo further the goal of reconciliation, the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; in 1971 established an internal &lt;a href=\"International%20Catholic-Jewish%20Liaison%20Committee\"&gt;International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mordecai%20Waxman\"&gt;International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations&lt;/a&gt;. After the committee met on May 4, 2001, Church officials stated that they would change the way Judaism is dealt with in Catholic seminaries and schools.\nThis new understanding of the relationship between Christians and Jews is reflected in the revised &lt;a href=\"Good%20Friday%20prayer%20for%20the%20Jews\"&gt;liturgy of Good Friday&lt;/a&gt; in a particular way. The &lt;a href=\"Good%20Friday%20Prayer\"&gt;Good Friday Prayer&lt;/a&gt; of the Roman Rite had Catholics praying that the \"perfidious Jews\" might be converted to \"the truth\". The ancient meaning of the Latin word \"perfidis\" in that context was \"unbelieving\", yet the English cognate \"perfidious\" had, over the centuries, gradually acquired the meaning of \"treacherous\". In order to eliminate misunderstanding on this point, Pope Pius XII ordered in 1955 that, in Catholic &lt;a href=\"liturgical%20book\"&gt;liturgical book&lt;/a&gt;s, the Latin word \"perfidis\" be more correctly translated as \"unbelieving\", ensuring that the prayer be understood in its original sense: praying for the Jews who remained \"unbelieving\" concerning the Messiah. Indeed, the same adjective was used in many of the ancient rituals for receiving non-Christian converts into the Catholic Church.\nOwing to the enduring potential for confusion and misunderstanding because of the divergence of English usage from the original Latin meaning, Pope John XXIII ordered that the Latin adjective \"perfidis\" be dropped from the &lt;a href=\"Good%20Friday%20Prayer%20for%20the%20Jews\"&gt;Good Friday Prayer for the Jews&lt;/a&gt;; in 1960 he ordered it removed from all rituals for the reception of converts.\nThe term \"&lt;a href=\"traditionalist%20Catholic\"&gt;traditionalist Catholic&lt;/a&gt;s\" often is used to apply to Catholic Christians who are particularly devoted to practicing the ancient traditions of the Church; yet there are also groups calling themselves \"traditionalist Catholics\" that either reject many of the changes made since Vatican II, or regard Vatican II as an invalid Council, or who broke away entirely from the Catholic Church after Vatican II. Some of these so-called traditionalist Catholics believe that the pope at the time, and all popes since, have led the majority of Catholic clergy and laity into heresy. They view interfaith dialogue with Jews as unnecessary and potentially leading to a \"watering-down\" of the Catholic faith. In the view of some traditionalist Catholics, Jews are believed to be damned unless they convert to Christianity. This, of course, is not the view of all who identify themselves as \"traditional\".\nIn 2002, the Pontifical Biblical Commission released \"The Jewish People and Their Sacred Scriptures\". In this document, the Catholic Church further clarifies its current position on Jews and their Scriptures, taking careful steps to avoid the appearance of sanctioning any Catholic hostility toward Jews. The Commission writes, \"Jewish messianic expectation is not in vain. It can become for us Christians a powerful stimulant to keep alive the eschatological dimension of our faith. Like them, we too live in expectation. The difference is that for us the One who is to come will have the traits of the Jesus who has already come and is already present and active among us.\" It continues, \"It cannot be said, therefore, that Jews do not see what has been proclaimed in the text, but that the Christian, in the light of Christ and in the Spirit, discovers in the text an additional meaning that was hidden there.\"\nIn December 2015, the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that Jews do not need to be converted to find salvation, and that Catholics should work with Jews to fight anti-semitism.\nProtestant churches.\nIn its Driebergen Declaration (1991), the European Lutheran Commission on the Church and the Jewish People rejected the traditional Christian \"teaching of contempt\" towards Jews and Judaism, and in particular, the &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther%20and%20antisemitism\"&gt;anti-Jewish writings of Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt;, and called for the reformation of church practice in the light of these insights.\nChristian Scholars Group.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Scholars%20Group\"&gt;Christian Scholars Group&lt;/a&gt; on Christian-Jewish Relations is a group of 22 Christian scholars, theologians, historians and clergy from six Christian &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; denominations and the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, which works to \"develop more adequate Christian theologies of the church's relationship to Judaism and the Jewish people.\"\nOrthodox Christianity.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; has a history of &lt;a href=\"antisemitism\"&gt;antisemitism&lt;/a&gt; associated with it. For example, the \"&lt;a href=\"Protocols%20of%20the%20Elders%20of%20Zion\"&gt;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&lt;/a&gt;\" were published under the aegis of Orthodox priests in Tsarist Russia. The Orthodox Christian attitude to the Jewish people is seen in the virulently &lt;a href=\"Anti-Semitic\"&gt;Anti-Semitic&lt;/a&gt; eastern Orthodox organizations which arose in the post Soviet eastern bloc.\nJoint efforts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"International%20Council%20of%20Christians%20and%20Jews\"&gt;International Council of Christians and Jews&lt;/a&gt; (ICCJ) is an umbrella organisation of 38 national Jewish-Christian dialogue organisations worldwide, governed according to the principles of the Ten Points of the &lt;a href=\"Seelisberg%20Conference\"&gt;Seelisberg Conference&lt;/a&gt;, which was held in 1947 to explore the relationship basis of &lt;a href=\"Christianity%20and%20antisemitism\"&gt;Christianity and antisemitism&lt;/a&gt;. The institute was founded in 1987.\nIn 1993 the ICCJ published \"Jews and Christians in Search of a Common Religious Basis for Contributing Towards a Better World\". The document \"contains both separate Jewish perspectives and Christian perspectives concerning mutual communication and cooperation as well as a joint view of a common religious basis for Jews and Christians to work together for a better world.\u00a0... These considerations are not 'the' official theological, philosophical nor ideological underpinnings of the ICCJ and its member organisations, but are an invitation to consider what our work is all about. They have no authority other than their intrinsic world.\"\nAnother initiative to promote joint initiatives between Jews and Christians began in October 2002, with the establishment and approval of the bylaws of the Council of Centers of Jewish-Christian Relations. The Council is an association of centers and institutes in the United States and Canada devoted to enhancing mutual understanding between Jews and Christians. Although most of these centers or institutes are located in the United States, there are also affiliate members from Europe and Israel. Representatives from major Christian and Jewish agencies and religious bodies in the United States are also members.\nJewish responses.\nThe 1906 \"&lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;\" article on \"Gentile: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah\" notes the following Jewish-Christian reconciliation: \n&lt;a href=\"Robert%20Gordis\"&gt;Robert Gordis&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Rabbinical%20Assembly\"&gt;Conservative rabbi&lt;/a&gt;, wrote an essay on \"Ground Rules for a Christian Jewish Dialogue\"; through his writings and similar writings of other rabbis in all Jewish denominations, one form or another of these rules eventually became more or less accepted by all parties engaging in interfaith dialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Rabbi\"&gt;Rabbi&lt;/a&gt;s from all the non-Orthodox movements of Judaism became involved in inter-faith theological dialogue with a number of Christian churches. &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Judaism\"&gt;Conservative Jews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Judaism\"&gt;Reform Jews&lt;/a&gt; now commonly engage in inter-faith theological dialogue; a small number of &lt;a href=\"Modern%20Orthodox%20Judaism\"&gt;Modern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; rabbis engage in such dialogue as well.\nMost Orthodox rabbis do not engage in such dialogue. The predominant position of Orthodoxy on this issue is based on the position of Rabbi &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Soloveitchik\"&gt;Joseph Soloveitchik&lt;/a&gt;; he held that &lt;a href=\"Judaism%20and%20Christianity\"&gt;Judaism and Christianity&lt;/a&gt; are \"two faith communities (which are) intrinsically antithetic\". In his view \"the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community. Hence the confrontation should occur not at a theological, but at a mundane human level\u00a0... the great encounter between man and God is a holy, personal and private affair, incomprehensible to the outsider\". As such, he ruled that theological dialogue between Judaism and Christianity was not possible.\nHowever, Rabbi Soloveitchik advocated closer ties between the Jewish and Christian communities. He held that communication between Jews and Christians was not merely permissible, but \"desirable and even essential\" on non-theological issues such as war and peace, the war on poverty, the struggle for people to gain freedom, issues of morality and civil rights, and to work together against the perceived threat of secularism. As a result of his ruling, Orthodox Jewish groups did not cooperate in interfaith discussions between the Catholic Church and Judaism, nor did they participate in the later interfaith dialogues between Protestant Christian groups and the Jewish community.\nModern papal views.\nPope &lt;a href=\"John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; made special effort to improve relations between Christianity (Catholicism in particular) and Jews and is often seen as a major figure in opening up dialogue between the Catholic and Jewish communities. He was the first pope to make an official visit to a synagogue, and made official apologies on behalf of the Catholic Church for wrongdoing against Jews throughout history. His theology often posed a &lt;a href=\"dual%20covenant%20theology\"&gt;dual covenant&lt;/a&gt; quality, and referred to Judaism as \"the older brother\" of Christianity.\nPope &lt;a href=\"Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; has expressed very similar views to those of some Orthodox rabbis, saying in a 2004 book with &lt;a href=\"Marcello%20Pera\"&gt;Marcello Pera&lt;/a&gt; (who was, at the time, &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Senate%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;president of the Italian Senate&lt;/a&gt;) that inter-cultural dialogue could often be positive, but that theological dialogue was practically impossible and not always desirable.\nNational Council of Synagogues.\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Council%20of%20Synagogues\"&gt;National Council of Synagogues&lt;/a&gt; (NCS) is a partnership of the non-Orthodox branches of Judaism. (Orthodox Jews have been invited to join, but Orthodox leaders have ruled that an Orthodox rabbi may not work with non-Orthodox rabbis as a matter of religious principle) This group deals with interfaith issues, and meets regularly with the representatives of the United States Catholic Bishops Conference, the National Council of Churches of Christ and various other denominations and religions. Their goal is to foster religious conversation and dialogue in the spirit of &lt;a href=\"religious%20pluralism\"&gt;religious pluralism&lt;/a&gt;.\nToday.\nToday the Jewish leaders are having connection with the Christian leaders.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Reflections%20on%20Covenant%20and%20Mission\"&gt;Reflections on Covenant and Mission&lt;/a&gt;\" is a statement developed jointly by the NCS and the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Bishops%27%20Committee%20for%20Ecumenical%20and%20Interreligious%20Affairs\"&gt;U.S. Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs&lt;/a&gt;.\nDabru Emet.\nRecently, more than 220 &lt;a href=\"rabbi\"&gt;rabbi&lt;/a&gt;s from all branches of &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt; signed a document called &lt;a href=\"Dabru%20Emet\"&gt;Dabru Emet&lt;/a&gt; (\"Speak the Truth\") that has since been used in Jewish education programs across the U.S.\nOrthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity.\nOn 3 December 2015, the &lt;a href=\"Center%20for%20Jewish-Christian%20Understanding%20and%20Cooperation\"&gt;Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation&lt;/a&gt; (CJCUC) spearheaded a petition of orthodox rabbis from around the world calling for increased partnership between Jews and Christians.\nThe unprecedented &lt;a href=\"Center%20for%20Jewish-Christian%20Understanding%20and%20Cooperation%23Orthodox%20Rabbinic%20Statement%20on%20Christianity\"&gt;Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, entitled \"To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians\", was initially signed by over 25 prominent Orthodox rabbis in Israel, United States and Europe and now has over 60 signatories.\n\"Between Jerusalem and Rome\".\nOn 31 August 2017, representatives of the &lt;a href=\"Conference%20of%20European%20Rabbis\"&gt;Conference of European Rabbis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rabbinical%20Council%20of%20America\"&gt;Rabbinical Council of America&lt;/a&gt;, and the Commission of the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Rabbinate%20of%20Israel\"&gt;Chief Rabbinate of Israel&lt;/a&gt; issued and presented the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Holy See&lt;/a&gt; with a statement entitled \"Between Jerusalem and Rome\". The document pays particular tribute to the Second Vatican Council's declaration \"&lt;a href=\"Nostra%20Aetate\"&gt;Nostra Aetate&lt;/a&gt;\", whose fourth chapter represents the \"Magna Charta\" of the Holy See's dialogue with the Jewish world. The statement \"Between Jerusalem and Rome\" does not hide the theological differences that exist between the two faith traditions while all the same it expresses a firm resolve to collaborate more closely, now and in the future.\nSpanish and Portuguese law of return.\nOn 16 December 1968, Spain formally revoked the &lt;a href=\"Alhambra%20Decree\"&gt;Alhambra Decree&lt;/a&gt;, the 1492 edict expelling Jews from Spain.\nThe Spanish government has actively pursued a policy of reconciliation with the descendants of its expelled Jews. In 1992, in a ceremony marking the 500th anniversary of the Edict of Expulsion, &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Carlos%20I%20of%20Spain\"&gt;King Juan Carlos&lt;/a&gt; (wearing a skullcap) prayed alongside Israeli president &lt;a href=\"Chaim%20Herzog\"&gt;Chaim Herzog&lt;/a&gt; and members of the Jewish community in the &lt;a href=\"Beth%20Yaacov%20Synagogue%20%28Madrid%2C%20Spain%29\"&gt;Beth Yaacov Synagogue (Madrid, Spain)&lt;/a&gt;. The King said that \"&lt;a href=\"Sepharad\"&gt;Sefarad&lt;/a&gt; (the Hebrew name for Spain) is no longer nostalgia, nor a place where Jews should feel as if at home, because Hispano-Jews are home in Spain. What matters is the desire to analyse and project the past in regards to our future.\"\nAs of November 2012, &lt;a href=\"Sephardic%20Jews\"&gt;Sephardic Jews&lt;/a&gt; have been given the right to automatic &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20nationality%20law%23Sephardi%20Jews\"&gt;Spanish nationality&lt;/a&gt; without the requirement of residence in Spain. Prior to November 2012, Sephardic Jews already had the right to obtain Spanish citizenship after a reduced residency period of two years (versus ten years for foreigners). While their citizenship is being processed, Sephardic Jews will be entitled to the consular protection of the Kingdom of Spain. This made Spain the only nation aside from &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%20return\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; to grant automatic citizenship to the descendants of Jews. Today, the number of Jews in Spain is estimated at 50,000. The deadline for applications under the Spanish law was September 2019, by which time 130,000 Jews had applied.\nIn April 2013, &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; passed a law of return, allowing descendants of Sephardic Jews who were expelled in the inquisition to claim &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20nationality%20law%23Jewish%20Law%20of%20Return\"&gt;Portuguese citizenship&lt;/a&gt; provided that they \"belong to a Sephardic community of Portuguese origin with ties to Portugal\" without a requirement for residence. The amendment to Portugal's \"Law on Nationality\" was approved unanimously on 11 April 2013. The law came into effect in March 2015, and is open-ended."
