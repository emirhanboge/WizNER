    "text": "An alley or alleyway is a narrow &lt;a href=\"lane\"&gt;lane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"footpath\"&gt;path&lt;/a&gt;, or passageway, often reserved for &lt;a href=\"pedestrian\"&gt;pedestrian&lt;/a&gt;s, which usually runs between, behind, or within buildings in the older parts of towns and cities. It is also a rear access or service road (&lt;a href=\"back%20lane\"&gt;back lane&lt;/a&gt;), or a path, walk, or avenue (French &lt;a href=\"all%C3%A9e\"&gt;all\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;) in a park or garden.\nA covered alley or passageway, often with shops, may be called an &lt;a href=\"arcade%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt;. The origin of the word alley is late &lt;a href=\"Middle%20English\"&gt;Middle English&lt;/a&gt;, from \"walking or passage\", from \"\" \"to go\", from \"to walk\".\nDefinition.\nThe word alley is used in two main ways:\nIn older cities and towns in Europe, alleys are often what is left of a medieval street network, or a &lt;a href=\"right-of-way%20%28transportation%29\"&gt;right of way&lt;/a&gt; or ancient &lt;a href=\"trail\"&gt;footpath&lt;/a&gt;. Similar paths also exist in some older North American towns and cities. In some older urban development in North America lanes at the rear of houses, to allow for deliveries and garbage collection, are called alleys. Alleys and ginnels were also the product of the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Health%20Act%201875\"&gt;1875 Public Health Act&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, where usually alleys run along the back of &lt;a href=\"Byelaw%20terraced%20house\"&gt;streets of terraced houses&lt;/a&gt;, with ginnels connecting them to the street every fifth house. Alleys may be paved, or unpaved, and a blind alley is a &lt;a href=\"cul-de-sac\"&gt;cul-de-sac&lt;/a&gt;. Modern &lt;a href=\"urban%20planning\"&gt;urban developments&lt;/a&gt; may also provide a service road to allow for waste collection, or rear access for &lt;a href=\"fire%20apparatus\"&gt;fire engines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"parking\"&gt;parking&lt;/a&gt;.\nSteps and stairs.\nBecause of geography, steps (&lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;) are the predominant form of alley in hilly cities and towns. This includes Quebec City in Canada and in the United States &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Steps%20of%20Pittsburgh\"&gt;Steps of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Steps%20of%20Cincinnati\"&gt;Steps of Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis\"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genoa\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;.\nArcades, etc..\nSome alleys are roofed because they are within buildings, such as the &lt;a href=\"traboule\"&gt;traboule&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt;, or when they are a pedestrian passage through railway embankments in Britain. The latter follow the line of &lt;a href=\"Rights%20of%20way%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;rights-of way&lt;/a&gt; that existed before the railway was built.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcade%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;Arcade&lt;/a&gt;s are another kind of covered passageway and the simplest kind are no more than alleys to which a glass roof was added later. Early examples of a shopping arcades include: &lt;a href=\"Palais%20Royal\"&gt;Palais Royal&lt;/a&gt; in Paris (opened in 1784); Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791). Most arcades differ from alleys in that they are architectural structures built with a commercial purpose and are a form of &lt;a href=\"shopping%20mall\"&gt;shopping mall&lt;/a&gt;. All the same alleys have for long been associated with various types of businesses, especially &lt;a href=\"pubs\"&gt;pubs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coffee%20houses\"&gt;coffee houses&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bazaar\"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Souq\"&gt;Souq&lt;/a&gt;s are an early form of arcade found in Asia and North Africa.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burlington%20Arcade\"&gt;Burlington Arcade&lt;/a&gt; (1819) was one of London's earliest covered shopping arcades. It was the successful prototype for larger glazed shopping arcades, beginning with the &lt;a href=\"Galeries%20Royales%20Saint-Hubert\"&gt;Saint-Hubert Gallery&lt;/a&gt; (1847) in Brussels and &lt;a href=\"Passage%20%28department%20store%29\"&gt;The Passage&lt;/a&gt; (1848) in &lt;a href=\"St%20Petersburg\"&gt;St Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, the first of Europe's grand arcades, to the &lt;a href=\"Galleria%20Umberto%20I\"&gt;Galleria Umberto I&lt;/a&gt; (1891) in Naples, the &lt;a href=\"Galleria%20Vittorio%20Emanuele%20II\"&gt;Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; (1867), and the &lt;a href=\"Block%20Arcade%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Block Arcade, Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, Australia (1893).\nNorth America.\nAlleys in North America are primarily used as service lanes. They provide a space for utility poles, fire escapes, garage access, delivery loading zones, and garbage bin pickup. \nSome historic alleys are found in older American and Canadian cities, like &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Charleston, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Annapolis\"&gt;Annapolis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Castle%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;New Castle, Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quebec%20City\"&gt;Quebec City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;St John's, Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Victoria, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;.\nCanada.\nQuebec City.\n&lt;a href=\"Qu%C3%A9bec%20City\"&gt;Qu\u00e9bec City&lt;/a&gt; was originally built on the riverside bluff &lt;a href=\"Cap%20Diamant\"&gt;Cap Diamant&lt;/a&gt; in the 17th century, and throughout Quebec City there are strategically placed public &lt;a href=\"Stairs\"&gt;stairways&lt;/a&gt; that link the bluff to the lower parts of the city. The Upper City is the site of Old Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s most significant historical sites, including 17th- and 18th-century chapels, the Citadel and the city ramparts. The Breakneck Stairs or Breakneck Steps (French: \"Escalier casse-cou\"), Quebec City's oldest stairway, were built in 1635. Originally called \"escalier Champlain\" \"Champlain Stairs\", \"escalier du Qu\u00eateux\" \"Beggars' Stairs\", or \"escalier de la Basse-Ville\" \"Lower Town Stairs\", they were given their current name in the mid-19th century, because of their steepness. The stairs have been restored several times, including an 1889 renovation by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Baillarg%C3%A9\"&gt;Charles Baillarg\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;.\nVictoria.\n&lt;a href=\"Fan%20Tan%20Alley\"&gt;Fan Tan Alley&lt;/a&gt; is an alley in &lt;a href=\"Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Victoria, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Chinatown%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally a gambling district with restaurants, shops, and opium dens. Today it is a tourist destination with many small shops including a barber shop, art gallery, Chinese cafe and apartments. It may well be the narrowest street in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. At its narrowest point it is only wide. Waddington Alley is another interesting alley in Victoria and the only street in that city still paved with wood blocks, an early pavement common in the downtown core. Other heritage features are buildings more than a century old lining the alley and a rare metal carriage curb that edges the sidewalk on the southern end.\nVancouver.\nNearly all blocks in Vancouver were designed with an alleyway, as the majority of homes do not have front driveways. Alleyways are, therefor, the way for home owners to access their garage and to also place their garbage for collection. Commercial laneway typically prohibit stopping except for delivery vehicles.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States alleys exist in both older commercial and residential areas, for both service purposes and automobile access. In residential areas, particularly in those that were built before 1950, alleys provide rear access to property where a garage was located, or where waste could be collected by service vehicles. A benefit of this was the location of these activities to the rear, less public side of a dwelling. Such alleys are generally roughly paved, but some may be dirt. Beginning in the late 20th century, they were seldom included in plans for new housing developments.\nAnnapolis, Maryland.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Annapolis%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Annapolis, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, was established as a city at the beginning of the 18th century, the streets were established in circles. That encouraged the creation of shortcuts, which over time became paved alleys. Some ten of these survive, and the city has recently worked on making them more attractive.\nAustin, Texas.\nSeveral residential neighborhoods in &lt;a href=\"Austin%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, have comprehensive alley systems. These include &lt;a href=\"Hyde%20Park%20Historic%20District%20%28Austin%2C%20Texas%29\"&gt;Hyde Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rosedale%2C%20Austin%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Rosedale&lt;/a&gt;, and areas northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Austin%20State%20Hospital\"&gt;Austin State Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. There are also numerous alleys downtown, particularly in the &lt;a href=\"Sixth%20Street%20%28Austin%2C%20Texas%29\"&gt;6th Street district&lt;/a&gt;, where bars and restaurants place their garbage for collection.\nBoston.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Beacon%20Hill%2C%20Boston\"&gt;Beacon Hill&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, Acorn Street, a narrow cobbled lane with &lt;a href=\"row%20houses\"&gt;row houses&lt;/a&gt;, is one of Boston's more attractive and historic alleys. Many of the alleys in the Back Bay and South End area are numbered (e.g. \"Public Alley 438\").\nCharleston, South Carolina.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"French%20Quarter%20%28Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina%29\"&gt;French Quarter&lt;/a&gt; of Charleston\u2019s historic district, Philadelphia Alley (c. 1766), originally named \"Cow Alley\", is one of several picturesque alleys. In 1810 William Johnson gave it the name of \"Philadelphia Alley\", although locals call the \"elegantly landscaped thoroughfare\" \"Dueler\u2019s Alley\". Starting on East Bay Street, Stolls Alley is just seventeen bricks wide at its start, and named for Justinus Stoll, an 18th-century blacksmith. For three hundred years, another of Charleston's narrow lanes, Lodge Alley, served a commercial purpose. Originally, &lt;a href=\"French%20Huguenot\"&gt;French Huguenot&lt;/a&gt; merchants built homes on it, along with warehouses to store supplies for their ships. Just wide, this alley was a useful means of access to Charleston\u2019s waterways. Today it leads to East Bay Street's many restaurants.\nCincinnati, Ohio.\nCincinnati is a city of hills. Before the advent of the automobile a system of stairway alleys provided pedestrians important and convenient access to and from their hill top homes. At the height of their use in the 19th century, over of hill side steps once connected the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Cincinnati%20neighborhoods\"&gt;neighborhoods of Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; to each other. The first steps were installed by residents of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Auburn%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Mount Auburn&lt;/a&gt; in the 1830s in order to gain easier access to &lt;a href=\"Findlay%20Market\"&gt;Findlay Market&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Over-the-Rhine\"&gt;Over-the-Rhine&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years many steps have fallen into disrepair but there is a movement now to rehabilitate them.\nNew Castle, Delaware.\nAnother early settled American city, &lt;a href=\"New%20Castle%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;New Castle&lt;/a&gt; has a number of interesting alleys, some of which are footpaths and others narrow, sometimes cobbled, lanes open to traffic.\nNew York City.\n&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; is unusual in that it has very few alleys, since the &lt;a href=\"Commissioner%27s%20Plan%20of%201811\"&gt;Commissioner's Plan of 1811&lt;/a&gt; did not include rear service alleys when it created Manhattan's grid. The exclusion of alleys has been criticized as a flaw in the plan, since services such as garbage pickup cannot be provided out of sight of the public, although other commentators feel that the lack of alleys is a benefit to the quality of life of the city. Since there are so few alleys in New York, film &lt;a href=\"location%20shooting\"&gt;location shooting&lt;/a&gt; requiring alleys tend to be concentrated in Cortlandt Alley, located between &lt;a href=\"Canal%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29\"&gt;Canal&lt;/a&gt; and Franklin Streets in the blocks between &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29\"&gt;Broadway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lafayette%20Street\"&gt;Lafayette Street&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"TriBeCa\"&gt;TriBeCa&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of lower Manhattan.\nTwo notable alleys in the &lt;a href=\"Greenwich%20Village\"&gt;Greenwich Village&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood in &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"MacDougal%20Street\"&gt;MacDougal Alley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Mews\"&gt;Washington Mews&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is a blind alley or \"cul-de-sac\". Greenwich Village also has a number of private alleys that lead to back houses, which can only be accessed by residents, including Grove Court, &lt;a href=\"Patchin%20Place\"&gt;Patchin Place&lt;/a&gt; and Milligan Place, all blind alleys. Patchin Place is notable for the writers who lived there. In the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Heights\"&gt;Brooklyn Heights&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, Grace Court Alley is another converted mews, as is Dennett Place in the &lt;a href=\"Carroll%20Gardens%2C%20Brooklyn\"&gt;Carroll Gardens&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood. The former is a \"cul-de-sac\".\n&lt;a href=\"Shubert%20Alley\"&gt;Shubert Alley&lt;/a&gt; is a long pedestrian alley at the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Broadway%20theatre\"&gt;Broadway theater district&lt;/a&gt; of New York City. The alley was originally created as a fire exit between the &lt;a href=\"Shubert%20Theatre%20%28Broadway%29\"&gt;Shubert Theatre&lt;/a&gt; on West 45th Street and the &lt;a href=\"Booth%20Theatre\"&gt;Booth Theatre&lt;/a&gt; on West 44th Street, and the &lt;a href=\"Astor%20Hotel\"&gt;Astor Hotel&lt;/a&gt; to their east. Actors once gathered in the alley, hoping to attract the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Shubert%20Brothers\"&gt;Shubert Brothers&lt;/a&gt; and get employment in their theatrical productions. When the hotel was torn down, and replaced with &lt;a href=\"One%20Astor%20Plaza\"&gt;One Astor Plaza&lt;/a&gt; (1515 Broadway), the apparent width of the alley increased, as the new building did not go all the way to the westernmost edge of the building lot. However, officially, Shubert Alley consists only of the space between the two theatres and the lot line.\nPhiladelphia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20City%2C%20Philadelphia\"&gt;Old City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Society%20Hill\"&gt;Society Hill&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods of &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest parts of the city, include a number of alleys, notably &lt;a href=\"Elfreth%27s%20Alley\"&gt;Elfreth's Alley&lt;/a&gt;, which is called \"Our nation's oldest residential street\", dating from 1702. , there were 32 houses on the street, which were built between 1728 and 1836.\nThere are numerous cobblestoned residential passages in Philadelphia, many no wider than a truck, and typically flanked with brick houses. A typical house on these alleys or lanes is called a Philadelphia \"Trinity\", named because it has three rooms, one to each floor, alluding to the Christian &lt;a href=\"Trinity\"&gt;Trinity&lt;/a&gt;. These alleys include Willings Alley, between S. 3rd and S. 4th Streets and Walnut and Spruce Streets. Other streets in Philadelphia which fit the general description of an alley, but are not named \"alley\", include , , Phillips Street, South American Street, Sansom Walk, St. James Place, and numerous others.\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nSteps, &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh\"&gt;Pittsburgh's&lt;/a&gt; equivalent for an alley, have defined it for many visitors. Writing in 1937, war correspondent &lt;a href=\"Ernie%20Pyle\"&gt;Ernie Pyle&lt;/a&gt; wrote of the steps of Pittsburgh:\nAnd then the steps. Oh Lord, the steps! I was told they actually had a Department of Steps. That isn\u2019t exactly true, although they do have an Inspector of Steps. But there are nearly of city-owned steps, going up mountainsides.\nThe City of Pittsburgh maintains 712 sets of &lt;a href=\"Steps%20of%20Pittsburgh\"&gt;city-owned steps&lt;/a&gt;, some of which are shown as streets on maps.\nSan Francisco, California.\nIn hilly &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; alleys often take the form of steps and it has several hundred public &lt;a href=\"stairway\"&gt;stairway&lt;/a&gt;s. Among the most famous is the stairway known as the Filbert steps, a continuation of &lt;a href=\"Filbert%20Street%20%28San%20Francisco%29\"&gt;Filbert Street&lt;/a&gt;. The Filbert Street Steps descend the east slope of Telegraph Hill along the line where Filbert Street would be if the hill was not so steep. The stairway is bordered by greenery, that consists both backyards, and a border garden tended to and paid for by the residents of the \"street\", and runs down to an eastern stub of Filbert Street and the walkway through the plaza to &lt;a href=\"Embarcadero%20%28San%20Francisco%29\"&gt;The Embarcadero&lt;/a&gt;. Many houses in this residential neighborhood are accessible only from the steps.\nAlso in &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belden%20Place\"&gt;Belden Place&lt;/a&gt; is a narrow pedestrian alley, bordered by restaurants, in the &lt;a href=\"Financial%20District%2C%20San%20Francisco%2C%20California\"&gt;Financial District&lt;/a&gt;, referred to as San Francisco's French Quarter for its historic ties to early French immigrants, and its popular contemporary French restaurants and institutions. The area was home to San Francisco's first French &lt;a href=\"settler\"&gt;settler&lt;/a&gt;s. Approximately 3,000, sponsored by the French government, arrived near the end of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Rush\"&gt;Gold Rush&lt;/a&gt; in 1851.\nSan Luis Obispo.\n&lt;a href=\"Bubblegum%20Alley\"&gt;Bubblegum Alley&lt;/a&gt; is a tourist attraction where people have left their finished bubblegum on the walls of an alley for decades. The walls have been cleaned multiple times only to have the gum rapidly reappear.\nSeattle.\nThere are over 600 publicly accessible stairways within &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, a city of hills, bluffs, and canyons. For an example see &lt;a href=\"Howe%20Street%20Stairs\"&gt;Howe Street Stairs&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreen and revitalized alleys.\nNumerous cities in the United States and Canada, such as &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Montr%C3%A9al\"&gt;Montr\u00e9al&lt;/a&gt;, have started reclaiming their alleys from garbage and crime by &lt;a href=\"greening\"&gt;greening&lt;/a&gt; the service lanes, or back ways, that run behind some houses. &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; has about of alleyways. In 2007, the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;Chicago Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; started converting conventional alleys which were paved with &lt;a href=\"asphalt\"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt; into so called Green Alleys. This program, called the Green Alley Program, is supposed to enable easier water runoff, as the alleyways in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; are not connected directly to the sewer system. With this program, the water will be able to seep through semi-permeable &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"asphalt\"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt; in which a colony of fungi and bacteria will establish itself. The bacteria will help breakup oils before the water is absorbed into the ground. The lighter color of the pavement will also reflect more light, making the area next to the alley cooler. The greening of such alleys or laneways can also involve the planting of native plants to further absorb rain water and moderate temperature.\nIn 2002, a group of &lt;a href=\"Baltimore\"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; residents from the &lt;a href=\"Patterson%20Park\"&gt;Patterson Park&lt;/a&gt; neighborhood approached the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation (CDC) looking for a way to improve the dirty, crime-ridden alley that ran behind their homes. Simultaneously, &lt;a href=\"Community%20Greens\"&gt;Community Greens&lt;/a&gt; also approached the Patterson Park CDC looking for an alley they could use as a pilot project in Baltimore. This led The Luzerne-Glover block being granted a temporary permit from the city to gate their alleyway, despite the fact that it was not yet legal to gate a &lt;a href=\"right-of-way\"&gt;right-of-way&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually the law was changed so that Baltimore residents could legally gate and green the alleys behind their homes.\nNew life has also come to other alleys within downtown commercial districts of various cities throughout the world with the opening of businesses, such as coffee houses, shops, restaurants and bars.\nAnother way that alleys and laneways are being revitalized is through laneway housing. A &lt;a href=\"laneway%20house\"&gt;laneway house&lt;/a&gt; is a form of housing that has been proposed on the west coast of &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Vancouver\"&gt;Metro Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; area. These homes are typically built into pre-existing &lt;a href=\"land%20lot\"&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt;, usually in the backyard and opening onto the back lane. This form of housing already exists in Vancouver, and revised regulations now encourage new developments as part of a plan to increase &lt;a href=\"urban%20density\"&gt;urban density&lt;/a&gt; in pre-existing neighbourhoods while retaining a single-family feel to the area. Vancouver's average laneway house is one and a half stories, with one or two bedrooms. Typical regulations require that the laneway home is built on the back half of a traditional lot in the space normally reserved for a garage.\nToronto also has a tradition of laneway housing and changed regulations to encourage new development. However this was discontinued in 2006 after staff reviewed the impact on services and safety.\nUnited Kingdom.\nEngland.\nLondon.\nLondon has numerous historical alleys, especially, but not exclusively, in its centre; this includes &lt;a href=\"The%20City%20of%20London\"&gt;The City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Covent%20Garden\"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holborn\"&gt;Holborn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clerkenwell\"&gt;Clerkenwell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloomsbury\"&gt;Bloomsbury&lt;/a&gt; amongst others.\nAn alley in London can also be called a passage, court, place, lane, and less commonly path, &lt;a href=\"arcade%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt;, walk, &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;steps&lt;/a&gt;, yard, terrace, and close. While both a court and close are usually defined as blind alleys, or \"cul-de-sacs\", several in London are throughways, for example Cavendish Court, a narrow passage leading from &lt;a href=\"Houndsditch\"&gt;Houndsditch&lt;/a&gt; into Devonshire Square, and Angel Court, which links King Street and &lt;a href=\"Pall%20Mall%2C%20London\"&gt;Pall Mall&lt;/a&gt;. Bartholomew Close is a narrow winding lane which can be called an alley by virtue of its narrowness, and because through-access requires the use of passages and courts between Little Britain, and Long Lane and Aldersgate Street.\nIn an old neighbourhood of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exchange%20Alley\"&gt;Exchange Alley&lt;/a&gt; or Change Alley is a narrow alleyway connecting shops and &lt;a href=\"coffeehouse\"&gt;coffeehouse&lt;/a&gt;s. It served as a convenient shortcut from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Exchange%2C%20London\"&gt;Royal Exchange&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Cornhill%2C%20London\"&gt;Cornhill&lt;/a&gt; to the Post Office on &lt;a href=\"Lombard%20Street%2C%20London\"&gt;Lombard Street&lt;/a&gt; and remains as one of a number of alleys linking the two streets. The coffeehouses of Exchange Alley, especially &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%27s%20Coffee-House\"&gt;Jonathan's&lt;/a&gt; and Garraway's, became an early venue for the lively trading of &lt;a href=\"Share%20%28finance%29\"&gt;share&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Commodity\"&gt;commodities&lt;/a&gt;. These activities were the progenitor of the modern &lt;a href=\"London%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;London Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.\nLombard Street and Change Alley had been the open-air meeting place of London's mercantile community before &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Gresham\"&gt;Thomas Gresham&lt;/a&gt; founded the Royal Exchange in 1565. In 1698, John Castaing began publishing the prices of stocks and commodities in Jonathan's Coffeehouse, providing the first evidence of systematic exchange of securities in London.\nChange Alley was the site of some noteworthy events in England's financial history, including the &lt;a href=\"South%20Sea%20Bubble\"&gt;South Sea Bubble&lt;/a&gt; from 1711 to 1720 and the panic of 1745.\nIn 1761 a club of 150 brokers and jobbers was formed to trade stocks. The club built its own building in nearby Sweeting's Alley in 1773, dubbed the \"New Jonathan's\", later renamed the &lt;a href=\"London%20Stock%20Exchange%20plc\"&gt;Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.\nWest of the City there are a number of alleys just north of &lt;a href=\"Trafalgar%20Square\"&gt;Trafalgar Square&lt;/a&gt;, including Brydges Place which is situated right next to the &lt;a href=\"Coliseum%20Theatre\"&gt;Coliseum Theatre&lt;/a&gt; and just 15 inches wide at its narrowest point, only one person can walk down it at a time. It is the narrowest alley in London and runs for , connecting St Martin's Lane with Bedfordbury in Covent Garden.\nClose by is another very narrow passage, Lazenby Court, which runs from Rose Street to Floral Street down the side of the &lt;a href=\"Lamb%20and%20Flag%2C%20Covent%20Garden\"&gt;Lamb and Flag&lt;/a&gt; pub; in order to pass people must turn slightly sideways. The Lamb &amp; Flag in Rose Street has a reputation as the oldest pub in the area, though records are not clear. The first mention of a pub on the site is 1772. The Lazenby Court was the scene of an attack on the famous poet and playwright &lt;a href=\"John%20Dryden\"&gt;John Dryden&lt;/a&gt; in 1679 by thugs hired by &lt;a href=\"John%20Wilmot%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Rochester\"&gt;John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he had a long-standing conflict.\nIn the same neighbourhood &lt;a href=\"Cecil%20Court\"&gt;Cecil Court&lt;/a&gt; has an entirely different character than the two previous alleys, and is a spacious pedestrian street with &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; shop-frontages that links &lt;a href=\"Charing%20Cross%20Road\"&gt;Charing Cross Road&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"St%20Martin%27s%20Lane\"&gt;St Martin's Lane&lt;/a&gt;, and it is sometimes used as a location by film companies.\nOne of the older thoroughfares in &lt;a href=\"Covent%20Garden\"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt;, Cecil Court dates back to the end of the 17th century. A tradesman's route at its inception, it later acquired the nickname Flicker Alley because of the concentration of early film companies in the Court. The first film-related company arrived in Cecil Court in 1897, a year after the first demonstration of moving pictures in the United Kingdom and a decade before London\u2019s first purpose built cinema opened its doors. Since the 1930s it has been known as the new Booksellers' Row as it is home to nearly twenty antiquarian and second-hand independent &lt;a href=\"bookshop\"&gt;bookshop&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt was the temporary home of an eight-year-old &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart\"&gt;Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Mozart%20family%20grand%20tour\"&gt;he was touring Europe&lt;/a&gt; in 1764. For almost four months the Mozart family lodged with barber John Couzin. According to some modern authorities, Mozart composed his first symphony while a resident of Cecil Court.\nNorth of the centre of London, &lt;a href=\"Camden%20Passage\"&gt;Camden Passage&lt;/a&gt; is a pedestrian passage off &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Street\"&gt;Upper Street&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Islington\"&gt;London Borough of Islington&lt;/a&gt;, famous because of its many antiques shops, and an antique market on Wednesdays and Saturday mornings. It was built, as an alley, along the backs of houses on Upper Street, then Islington High Street, in 1767.\nScotland and Northern Ireland.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Scots%20language\"&gt;Scots&lt;/a&gt; terms &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Closes%20on%20the%20Royal%20Mile\"&gt;close&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wynd\"&gt;wynd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pend\"&gt;pend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vennel\"&gt;vennel&lt;/a&gt; are general in most towns and cities. The term close has an unvoiced \"s\" as in \"sad\". The Scottish author &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Rankin\"&gt;Ian Rankin&lt;/a&gt;'s novel \"&lt;a href=\"Fleshmarket%20Close\"&gt;Fleshmarket Close&lt;/a&gt;\" was retitled \"Fleshmarket Alley\" for the American market. Close is the generic Scots term for alleyways, although they may be individually named closes, entries, courts and wynds. Originally, a close was private property, hence gated and closed to the public.\nA wynd is typically a narrow lane between houses, an open throughway, usually wide enough for a horse and cart. The word derives from &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt; \"venda\", implying a turning off a main street, without implying that it is curved. In fact, most wynds are straight. In many places wynds link streets at different heights and thus are mostly thought of as being ways up or down hills.\nA pend is a passageway that passes through a building, often from a street through to a &lt;a href=\"courtyard\"&gt;courtyard&lt;/a&gt;, and typically designed for vehicular rather than exclusively pedestrian access. A pend is distinct from a &lt;a href=\"vennel\"&gt;vennel&lt;/a&gt; or a close, as it has rooms directly above it, whereas vennels and closes are not covered over.\nA &lt;a href=\"vennel\"&gt;vennel&lt;/a&gt; is a passageway between the gables of two buildings which can in effect be a minor street in &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"North%20east%20England\"&gt;north east of England&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in the old centre of &lt;a href=\"Durham%2C%20England\"&gt;Durham&lt;/a&gt;. In Scotland, the term originated in &lt;a href=\"royal%20burghs\"&gt;royal burghs&lt;/a&gt; created in the twelfth century, the word deriving from the Old French word \"venelle\" meaning \"alley\" or \"lane\". Unlike a tenement entry to private property, known as a \"close\", a vennel was a public way leading from a typical &lt;a href=\"high%20street\"&gt;high street&lt;/a&gt; to the open ground beyond the &lt;a href=\"Burgage\"&gt;burgage plots&lt;/a&gt;. The Latin form is \"venella\".\nEurope.\nFrance.\nLyon's traboules.\nThe traboules of &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; are passageways that cut through a house or, in some cases, a whole city block, linking one street with another. They are distinct from most other alleys in that they are mainly enclosed within buildings and may include staircases. While they are found in other French cities including &lt;a href=\"Villefranche-sur-Sa%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Villefranche-sur-Sa\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A2con\"&gt;M\u00e2con&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chamb%C3%A9ry\"&gt;Chamb\u00e9ry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint-%C3%89tienne\"&gt;Saint-\u00c9tienne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Louhans\"&gt;Louhans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chalon%20sur%20Sa%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Chalon sur Sa\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vienne%20%28Is%C3%A8re%29\"&gt;Vienne (Is\u00e8re)&lt;/a&gt;, Lyon has many more; in all there are about 500. The word traboule comes from the Latin \"trans ambulare\", meaning \"to cross\", and the first of them were possibly built as early as the 4th century. As the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; disintegrated, the residents of early Lyon\u2014&lt;a href=\"Lugdunum\"&gt;Lugdunum&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Roman &lt;a href=\"Gaul\"&gt;Gaul&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were forced to move from the Fourvi\u00e8re hill to the banks of the river Sa\u00f4ne when their aqueducts began to fail. The traboules grew up alongside their new homes, linking the streets that run parallel to the river &lt;a href=\"Sa%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Sa\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt; and going down to the river itself. For centuries they were used by people to fetch water from the river and then by craftsmen and traders to transport their goods. By the 18th century they were invaluable to what had become the city\u2019s defining industry, textiles, especially silk. Nowadays, traboules are tourist attractions, and many are free and open to the public. Most traboules are on private property, serving as entrances to local apartments.\nGermany.\nThe old town of &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BCbeck\"&gt;L\u00fcbeck&lt;/a&gt; has over 100 \"\", particularly leading off the streets Engelswisch, Engelsgrube and Glockengie\u00dferstra\u00dfe, as well as around the cathedral. Some are very low as well as narrow, and others open into more spacious courtyards (\"H\u00f6fe\").\n\"&lt;a href=\"Spreuerhofstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Spreuerhofstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt;\" is the world's narrowest &lt;a href=\"street\"&gt;street&lt;/a&gt;, found in the city of &lt;a href=\"Reutlingen\"&gt;Reutlingen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg\"&gt;Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. It ranges from at its narrowest to at its widest. The lane was built in 1727 during the reconstruction efforts after the area was completely destroyed in the massive citywide fire of 1726 and is officially listed in the Land-Registry Office as City Street Number 77.\n&lt;a href=\"Lintgasse\"&gt;Lintgasse&lt;/a&gt; is an alley () in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20town\"&gt;Old town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; between the two squares of \"Alter Markt\" and \"Fischmarkt\". It is a &lt;a href=\"pedestrian%20zone\"&gt;pedestrian zone&lt;/a&gt; and though only some 130 metres long, is nevertheless famous for its medieval history. The Lintgasse was first mentioned in the 12th century as \"in Lintgazzin\", which may be derived from &lt;a href=\"basketmaker\"&gt;basketmaker&lt;/a&gt;s who wove fish baskets out of &lt;a href=\"Linden%20tree\"&gt;Linden tree&lt;/a&gt; barks. These craftsmen were called \"Lindslizer\", meaning \"Linden splitter\". During the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the area was also known as \"plat\u0113a subri\" or \"plat\u0113a suberis\", meaning street of \"&lt;a href=\"Quercus%20suber\"&gt;Quercus suber&lt;/a&gt;\", the cork oak tree. Lintgasse 8 to 14 used to be homes of medieval &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s as still can be seen by signs like \"Zum Huynen\", \"Zum Ritter\" or \"Zum Gir\". During the 19th-century the Lintgasse was called \"Stink-Linkga\u00df\", a because of its poor air quality.\nItaly.\nThe common Italian word for an alley is \"vicolo\".\nVenice.\nVenice is largely a traffic free city and there is, in addition to the canals, a maze of around 3000 lanes and alleys called \"calli\" (which means narrow). Smaller ones are \"call\u00e8tte\" or \"calles\u00e8lle\", while larger ones are \"calli large\". Their width varies from just over to . The narrowest is Calletta Varisco, which just ; Calle Stretta is wide and Calle Ca' Zusto . The main ones are also called \"salizada\" and wider \"calli\", where trade proliferates, are called \"riga\", while blind \"calli\", used only by residents to reach their homes, are \"ramo\".\nNetherlands.\nCities such as &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam\"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Groningen\"&gt;Groningen&lt;/a&gt; have numerous . They often run between the major streets, roughly parallel to each other but not at right angles to the streets, following the old field boundaries and ditches.\nSweden.\n\"Gr\u00e4nd\" is Swedish for an alley and there are numerous \"gr\u00e4nder\", or alleys in &lt;a href=\"Gamla%20stan\"&gt;Gamla stan&lt;/a&gt;, The Old Town, of &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. The town dates back to the 13th century, with medieval alleyways, &lt;a href=\"Cobblestone\"&gt;cobbled&lt;/a&gt; streets, and historic buildings. &lt;a href=\"Brick%20Gothic\"&gt;North German architecture&lt;/a&gt; has had a strong influence in the Old Town's buildings. Some of Stockholm's alleys are very narrow pedestrian &lt;a href=\"footpath\"&gt;footpath&lt;/a&gt;s, while others are very narrow, cobbled streets, or lanes open to slow moving traffic.\n&lt;a href=\"M%C3%A5rten%20Trotzigs%20gr%C3%A4nd\"&gt;M\u00e5rten Trotzigs gr\u00e4nd&lt;/a&gt; (\"Alley of M\u00e5rten Trotzig\") runs from &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4sterl%C3%A5nggatan\"&gt;V\u00e4sterl\u00e5nggatan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4rntorget%20%28Stockholm%29\"&gt;J\u00e4rntorget&lt;/a&gt; up to &lt;a href=\"Pr%C3%A4stgatan\"&gt;Pr\u00e4stgatan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyska%20Stallplan\"&gt;Tyska Stallplan&lt;/a&gt;, and part of it consists of 36 steps. At its narrowest the alley is a mere 90\u00a0cm (35 inches) wide, making it the narrowest street in Stockholm.\nThe alley is named after the &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bourgeoisie\"&gt;burgher&lt;/a&gt; M\u00e5rten Trotzig (1559\u20131617), who, born in &lt;a href=\"Wittenberg\"&gt;Wittenberg&lt;/a&gt;, emigrated to Stockholm in 1581, and bought properties in the alley in 1597 and 1599, also opening a shop there. According to sources from the late 16th century, he was dealing in first iron and later copper, by 1595 had sworn his burgher oath, and was later to become one of the richest merchants in Stockholm.\nPossibly referred to as &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%A5ngsund%20%28Stockholm%29\"&gt;Tr\u00e5ngsund&lt;/a&gt; (\"Narrow strait\") before M\u00e5rten Trotzig gave his name to the alley, it is mentioned in 1544 as \"Tronge trappe grenden\" (\"Narrow Alley Stairs\"). In 1608 it is referred to \"Trappegrenden\" (\"The Stairs Alley\"), but a map dated 1733 calls it \"Trotz gr\u00e4nd\". Closed off in the mid 19th century, not to be reopened until 1945, its present name was officially sanctioned by the city in 1949.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20streets%20and%20squares%20in%20Gamla%20stan\"&gt;List of streets and squares in Gamla stan&lt;/a&gt;\" provides links to many pages that describe other alleys in the oldest part of Stockholm; e.g. &lt;a href=\"Kolm%C3%A4targr%C3%A4nd\"&gt;Kolm\u00e4targr\u00e4nd&lt;/a&gt; (Coal Meter's Alley); &lt;a href=\"Skeppar%20Karls%20Gr%C3%A4nd\"&gt;Skeppar Karls Gr\u00e4nd&lt;/a&gt; (Skipper Karl's Alley); &lt;a href=\"Skeppar%20Olofs%20Gr%C3%A4nd\"&gt;Skeppar Olofs Gr\u00e4nd&lt;/a&gt; (Skipper Olof's Alley); and &lt;a href=\"Helga%20Lekamens%20Gr%C3%A4nd\"&gt;Helga Lekamens Gr\u00e4nd&lt;/a&gt; (Alley of the Holy Body).\nAsia.\nAlleyways are an urban form historically shared by most cities in Asia, yet understudied. Alleyways in Asia can be understood as ordinary neighbourhood landscape providing the setting for everyday urban life and place-based identities being shaped by varied everyday practices, collective experiences and forces. This turns the traditional approach of \"global cities\" upside-down and contributes to a renewed conception of metropolization as a highly situated process, where forces at play locally, in each alleyway neighbourhood, are both intertwined and labile. Thus it is important to study the modern transformation of Asian cities and their urban cultures, from the perspective of the alleyways, including new approaches to social life, urban change and urban governance.\nChina.\n&lt;a href=\"Hutongs\"&gt;Hutongs&lt;/a&gt; () are a type of narrow streets or alleys, commonly associated with northern Chinese cities, most prominently &lt;a href=\"Beijing\"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Beijing, hutongs are alleys formed by lines of \"&lt;a href=\"siheyuan\"&gt;siheyuan&lt;/a&gt;\", traditional &lt;a href=\"courtyard\"&gt;courtyard&lt;/a&gt; residences. Many neighbourhoods were formed by joining one \"siheyuan\" to another to form a hutong, and then joining one hutong to another. The word hutong is also used to refer to such neighbourhoods.\nDuring China\u2019s &lt;a href=\"China%23Dynastic%20rule\"&gt;dynastic period&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20sovereign\"&gt;emperors&lt;/a&gt; planned the city of Beijing and arranged the residential areas according to the social classes of the &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Dynasty\"&gt;Zhou Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (1027 \u2013 256 BC). The term \"hutong\" appeared first during the &lt;a href=\"Yuan%20Dynasty\"&gt;Yuan Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, and is a term of &lt;a href=\"Mongolian%20language\"&gt;Mongolian&lt;/a&gt; origin meaning \"town\".\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the &lt;a href=\"Qing\"&gt;Qing&lt;/a&gt; court was disintegrating as China\u2019s dynastic era came to an end. The traditional arrangement of hutongs was also affected. Many new hutongs, built haphazardly and with no apparent plan, began to appear on the outskirts of the old city, while the old ones lost their former neat appearance.\nFollowing the founding of the &lt;a href=\"People%E2%80%99s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People\u2019s Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; in 1949, many of the old hutongs of Beijing disappeared, replaced by wide boulevards and high rises. Many residents left the lanes where their families lived for generations for apartment buildings with modern amenities. In &lt;a href=\"Xicheng%20District\"&gt;Xicheng District&lt;/a&gt;, for example, nearly 200 hutongs out of the 820 it held in 1949 have disappeared. However, many of Beijing\u2019s ancient hutongs still stand, and a number of them have been designated protected areas. Many hutongs, some several hundred years old, in the vicinity of the &lt;a href=\"Gulou%20and%20Zhonglou%20%28Beijing%29\"&gt;Bell Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gulou%20and%20Zhonglou%20%28Beijing%29\"&gt;Drum Tower&lt;/a&gt; and Shichahai Lake are preserved amongst recreated contemporary two- and three-storey versions.\nHutongs represent an important cultural element of the city of Beijing and the hutongs are residential neighborhoods which still form the heart of Old Beijing. While most Beijing hutongs are straight, Jiudaowan (\u4e5d\u9053\u5f2f, literally \"Nine Turns\") Hutong turns nineteen times. At its narrowest section, &lt;a href=\"Qianshi%20Hutong\"&gt;Qianshi Hutong&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Qianmen\"&gt;Qianmen&lt;/a&gt; (Front Gate) is only 40 centimeters (16 inches) wide.\nThe Shanghai &lt;a href=\"longtang\"&gt;longtang&lt;/a&gt; is loosely equivalent to the &lt;a href=\"hutong\"&gt;hutong&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Beijing\"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;. A longtang (\u5f04\u5802 \"l\u00f2ngt\u00e1ng\", &lt;a href=\"Shanghainese\"&gt;Shanghainese&lt;/a&gt;: \"longdang\") is a laneway in &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; and, by extension, a community centred on a laneway or several interconnected laneways. On its own long (traditional Chinese \u8856 or \u5f04, simplified Chinese \u5f04) is a Chinese term for \"alley\" or \"lane\", which is often left untranslated in Chinese addresses, but may also be translated as \"lane\", and \"tang\" is a parlor or hallway. It is sometimes called lilong (\u91cc\u5f04); the latter name incorporates the \"-li\" suffix often used in the name of residential developments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As with the term hutong, the Shanghai longdang can either refers to the lanes that the houses face onto, or a group of houses connected by the lane.\nJapan.\n is a small area of &lt;a href=\"Shinjuku\"&gt;Shinjuku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, famous both as an area of architectural interest and for its nightlife. It is composed of a network of six narrow alleys, connected by even narrower passageways which are just about wide enough for a single person to pass through. Over 200 tiny shanty-style bars, clubs and eateries are squeezed into this area.\nIts architectural importance is that it provides a view into the relatively recent past of Tokyo, when large parts of the city resembled present-day Golden Gai, particularly in terms of the extremely narrow lanes and the tiny two-storey buildings. Nowadays, most of the surrounding area has been redeveloped. Typically, the buildings are just a few feet wide and are built so close to the ones next door that they nearly touch. Most are two-storey, having a small &lt;a href=\"bar%20%28establishment%29\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt; at street level and either another bar or a tiny &lt;a href=\"apartment\"&gt;flat&lt;/a&gt; upstairs, reached by a steep set of stairs. None of the bars are very large; some are so small that they can only fit five or so customers at one time. The buildings are generally ramshackle, and the alleys are dimly lit, giving the area a very scruffy and run-down appearance. However, Golden Gai is not a cheap place to drink, and the clientele that it attracts is generally well off.\nGolden Gai is well known yokocho\u3000and meeting place for musicians, artists, directors, writers, academics and actors, including many celebrities. Many of the bars only welcome regular customers, who initially should be introduced by an existing patron, although many others welcome non-regulars, some even making efforts to attract overseas tourists by displaying signs and price lists in English. Golden Gai was known for prostitution before 1958, when prostitution became illegal. Since then it has developed as a drinking area, and at least some of the bars can trace their origins back to the 1960s.\nApart from drinking alleys (drinking yokocho), &lt;a href=\"shotengai\"&gt;shotengai&lt;/a&gt; and yokocho shotengais, we should not forget to mention the ordinary alleyways, the rojis which seem exist in all parts of the Japanese urban landscape. The roji which was once part of people\u2019s personal spatial sphere and everyday life has been transformed by diverse and competing interests. Marginalised through the emergence of new forms of housing and public spaces, re-appropriated by different fields, and re-invented by the contemporary urban design discourse, the social meaning attached to the roji is being re-interpreted by individuals, subcultures and new social movements.Thus, their existence is in danger, therefore it even more important to document, visualize and analyse their spatial, social and cultural function within the city\nAustralasia.\nAustralia.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Lanes%20and%20arcades%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;Lanes and arcades of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lanes%20of%20Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;\nNorth Africa.\nA &lt;a href=\"medina%20quarter\"&gt;medina quarter&lt;/a&gt; ( \"the old city\") is a distinct city section found in many &lt;a href=\"North%20Africa\"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt;n cities. The medina is typically walled, contains many narrow and maze-like streets. The word \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Amedina\"&gt;medina&lt;/a&gt;\" ( ) itself simply means \"city\" or \"town\" in modern Arabic.\nBecause of the very narrow streets, medinas are generally free from car traffic, and in some cases even motorcycle and bicycle traffic. The streets can be less than a metre wide. This makes them unique among highly populated urban centres. The Medina of &lt;a href=\"Fes\"&gt;Fes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fes%20el%20Bali\"&gt;Fes el Bali&lt;/a&gt;, is considered one of the largest car-free urban areas in the world.\nReferences.\nNotes\nBibliography"
