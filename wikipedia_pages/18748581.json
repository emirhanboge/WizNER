    "text": "The Police of the Czech Republic (&lt;a href=\"Czech%20language\"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt;: \"Policie \u010cesk\u00e9 republiky\") is the national &lt;a href=\"law%20enforcement%20agency\"&gt;law enforcement agency&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;. It was established on 15 July 1991 under the jurisdiction of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Czech%20Republic%29\"&gt;Ministry of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;. The agency is tasked with protecting citizens, property and public order and as of 2015, there were around 40,500 employees. Czech state police cooperates with &lt;a href=\"Law%20enforcement%20in%20the%20Czech%20Republic\"&gt;municipal police&lt;/a&gt; departments, which are present in local municipalities.\nHistory.\nThe Police of the Czech Republic took over land management after the communist SNB in the Czech Republic with the exception of military police (provosts) who are part of the army. Members were recruited from the former communist &lt;a href=\"Sbor%20n%C3%A1rodn%C3%AD%20bezpe%C4%8Dnosti\"&gt;SNB&lt;/a&gt; (National Security Corps), after passing a vetting \"democratic\" commission established after the Velvet Revolution in 1989 to eliminate from the police force communist ideologues and agents of the &lt;a href=\"StB\"&gt;secret police&lt;/a&gt;. A similar procedure was also undertaken in the then-Slovak Republic. Some police officers were employed by a small federal police force, whose mandate expired on 31 December 1992.\nJurisdiction and organisation.\nThe Police of the Czech Republic has general jurisdiction in the investigation of misdemeanors and crimes. Its proceedings are overseen by an independent prosecutor, who can bring charges in criminal matters. It does not have jurisdiction in fields falling within the competence of other specialized bodies, such as the Customs service, military police, judicial guard or the Secret service. P\u010cR is the main investigative body of the Ministry of the Interior. It should not be confused with the &lt;a href=\"municipal%20police\"&gt;municipal police&lt;/a&gt;, which may be established by a municipality and which supervises public order and road safety; &lt;a href=\"municipal%20police\"&gt;municipal police&lt;/a&gt; also have jurisdiction only over &lt;a href=\"misdemeanour\"&gt;misdemeanour&lt;/a&gt;s, and in criminal investigations may serve only in a supportive role for the state police.\nThe Police of the Czech Republic is responsible for search and rescue operations and on this behalf cooperates with &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Rescue%20Service%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Mountain Rescue Service of the Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; that is highly professional rescue agency.\nSome crimes (such as &lt;a href=\"terrorism\"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;) are being solved in co-operation with &lt;a href=\"intelligence%20agency\"&gt;intelligence agencies&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Security%20Information%20Service\"&gt;BIS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Office%20for%20Foreign%20Relations%20and%20Information\"&gt;\u00daZSI&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn-duty officers are obliged to carry service weapons depending on the nature of their work (administrative vs. field work) or by their superior executive officer ordinance.\nRegardless of being assigned to nationwide or regional units all police officers while on or off-duty have right (and obligation) to act if the crime or serious offense is happening and life, health or property may be in imminent danger. Civilian employees of police are obliged to act only while on-duty. Generally police officers are not allowed to carry service weapons while off-duty if not approved by regional or unit police chief, which is on condition that \"their life maybe in serious immediate danger\". If police officer still wants to carry weapon off-duty he/she has to use their personal handgun like any other armed citizen. Off-duty officer can use his personal weapon when acting as police officer (which makes him on-duty).\nRegional jurisdiction.\nThere are 14 regional headquarters, with jurisdictions covering the &lt;a href=\"regions%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic\"&gt;regions of the Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolice officers serving under regional HQs are usually organized in the following sections:\nEquipment.\nAs of 2011, the Police of the Czech Republic employs about 41,000 officers, with a ratio of about 45 officers per 10,000 population.
