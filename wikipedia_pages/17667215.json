    "text": "The Gauliga Mittelrhein was the highest &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; league in the central and southern part of the &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Rhine%20Province\"&gt;Rhine Province&lt;/a&gt; from 1933 to 1945. Shortly after the formation of the league, the &lt;a href=\"Nazis\"&gt;Nazis&lt;/a&gt; reorganised the administrative regions in Germany, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Gau%20%28administrative%20division%29\"&gt;Gaue&lt;/a&gt;\" \"&lt;a href=\"Gau%20K%C3%B6ln-Aachen\"&gt;K\u00f6ln-Aachen&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Gau%20Moselland\"&gt;Moselland&lt;/a&gt;\" replaced the &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussian province&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Rhine\"&gt;Middle Rhine&lt;/a&gt; (German: \"Mittelrhein\") region.\nFrom 1941, the \"Gauliga Mittelrhein\" was split into two separate leagues, the \"Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen\" and the \"Gauliga Moselland\". From this time, it also included clubs from the occupied &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Eupen-Malmedy\"&gt;Eupen-Malmedy&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nGauliga Mittelrhein.\nThe league was introduced by the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Sports%20Office\"&gt;Nazi Sports Office&lt;/a&gt; in 1933, after the &lt;a href=\"Machtergreifung\"&gt;Nazi takeover of power&lt;/a&gt; in Germany. It replaced the \"&lt;a href=\"Bezirksklasse\"&gt;Bezirksligas&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Oberligas\" as the highest level of play in German football competitions.\nIn its first season, the league had eleven clubs, playing each other once at home and once away. The league champion then qualified for the &lt;a href=\"German%20football%20champions\"&gt;German championship&lt;/a&gt;. The bottom three teams were relegated. The season after, the league was reduced to ten teams and remained at this strength until 1939. From 1937, it also included &lt;a href=\"Alemannia%20Aachen\"&gt;Alemannia Aachen&lt;/a&gt; which had previously belonged to the \"&lt;a href=\"Gauliga%20Niederrhein\"&gt;Gauliga Niederrhein&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDue to the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; in 1939, the league was split into two regional groups, a northern division of seven and a southern of six clubs. The two group champions then played a home-and-away final for the \"Gauliga\" championship.\nIn its last season, 1940\u201341, the league returned to a single-division, ten-team format. At the end of this season, the league was split into two separate \"Gauligas\", divided along the administrative divisions of the two \"Gaue\".\nGauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen.\nThe territory of the new \"Gauliga K\u00f6ln-Aachen\" was made up of the area of the \"Gau K\u00f6ln-Aachen\" and the &lt;a href=\"Eupen-Malmedy\"&gt;Eupen-Malmedy&lt;/a&gt; region, the German-speaking part of &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; which had been annexed to the \"Gau\" after the German victory in 1940. However, no club from this formerly Belgian region played at highest level during the war.\nThe league started with nine clubs in a single division in 1941 and expanded to ten for the 1942-43 season. In its last completed season, 1943\u201344, it returned to a strength of nine teams. Due to the arrival of the war in the region and the conquest of &lt;a href=\"Aachen\"&gt;Aachen&lt;/a&gt; by the allied forces, the last season probably not started anymore at all.\nGauliga Moselland.\nThe territory of the new \"Gauliga Moselland\" was made up of the area of the \"Gau Moselland\" and &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;, which had been annexed by Germany and added to the \"Gau\" after the German victory in 1940.\nThe league started out with two regional divisions of six clubs each with a home-and-away final to determine the \"Gauliga\" champion. The western group compromised two clubs from the city of &lt;a href=\"Trier\"&gt;Trier&lt;/a&gt; and four Luxembourgian clubs. The league modus remained the same for the 1942-43 season but the number of clubs from Luxembourg increased to five.\nIn the 1943-44 season, the eastern group comprised five teams while the western had seven clubs. With the arrival of allied forces in the region in late 1944, football was of low priority and the last season, 1944-45 was probably not started any more.\nAftermath.\nWith the end of the Nazi era, the \"Gauligas\" ceased to exist and the northern part of the region found itself in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Allied%20Occupation%20Zones%20in%20Germany\"&gt;occupation zone&lt;/a&gt; while the south became part of the &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; zone. The annexed regions of Belgium and Luxembourg were taken from Germany again after 1945.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Oberliga%20S%C3%BCdwest%20%281945-63%29\"&gt;Oberliga S\u00fcdwest&lt;/a&gt; was introduced as the highest football league in the French occupation zone in 1945, replacing the \"Gauliga\". The territory of the pre-1940 \"Gau Moselland\" became part of the new state of &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the British zone, which the former \"Gau K\u00f6ln-Aachen\" was part of, top-level football did not resume straight away, unlike in Southern Germany, and only in 1947 was a new, highest league introduced, the &lt;a href=\"Oberliga%20West%20%281947-63%29\"&gt;Oberliga West&lt;/a&gt;, which covered all of the new state of &lt;a href=\"North%20Rhine-Westphalia\"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounding members of the league.\nThe eleven founding members and their league positions in the 1932-33 season were:\nWinners and runners-up of the league.\nThe winners and runners-up of the league:\nPlacings in the league 1933-44.\nThe complete list of all clubs participating in the league:\nClubs from Luxembourg in the Gauliga Moselland.\nFrom 1941, clubs from the occupied country of Luxembourg took part in the German \"Gauliga\" system. The most successful of those was the \"FV Stadt D\u00fcdelingen\", who reached the German championship finals round, losing to the &lt;a href=\"FC%20Schalke%2004\"&gt;FC Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt; 0-2 in 1942.\nThe following clubs played in the Gauliga under their Germanised names:"
