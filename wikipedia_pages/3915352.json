    "text": "Marina Solodkin (, ; 31 May 1952 \u2013 16 March 2013) was an Israeli politician and member of the &lt;a href=\"Knesset\"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Yisrael%20BaAliyah\"&gt;Yisrael BaAliyah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Likud\"&gt;Likud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kadima\"&gt;Kadima&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe immigrated to Israel from Russia in the early 1990s and joined the immigrant &lt;a href=\"Yisrael%20BaAliyah\"&gt;Yisrael BaAliyah&lt;/a&gt; party and entered the &lt;a href=\"Knesset\"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. She served as a lawmaker until February 2013 when she lost her seat in the elections.\nBiography.\nMarina Gershman (later Solodkin) was born in Moscow in the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. Solodkin studied at &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20State%20University\"&gt;Moscow State University&lt;/a&gt;, where she gained a &lt;a href=\"doctorate\"&gt;PhD&lt;/a&gt; in economic and social science. She immigrated to Israel in 1991. Solodkin died of a stroke in a hotel room in &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; on 16 March 2013. She wrote on her Facebook page the Friday before: \"In a few hours' time I will take off for Latvia in order to take part in a conference I was invited to by the Latvian Committee against Fascism\u2026 Lately, Neo-Nazism is raising its ugly head in Eastern Europe, in the post-Soviet states. We must remain vigilant.\"\nShe was survived by her husband and two children. She lived in &lt;a href=\"Ashkelon\"&gt;Ashkelon&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical career.\nIn Israel, Solodkin joined the Russian-immigrant party, &lt;a href=\"Yisrael%20BaAliyah\"&gt;Yisrael BaAliyah&lt;/a&gt; led by Soviet dissident &lt;a href=\"Natan%20Sharansky\"&gt;Natan Sharansky&lt;/a&gt;. She was elected to the Knesset in the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Israeli%20legislative%20election\"&gt;1996 elections&lt;/a&gt; on the party's list and chaired the committee on the Status of Women. After retaining her seat in the &lt;a href=\"1999%20Israeli%20legislative%20election\"&gt;1999 elections&lt;/a&gt;, she was appointed Deputy &lt;a href=\"Immigrant%20Absorption%20Minister%20of%20Israel\"&gt;Minister of Immigrant Absorption&lt;/a&gt;, a post she regained during the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Israeli%20legislative%20election\"&gt;16th Knesset&lt;/a&gt; after Yisrael BaAliyah had merged into &lt;a href=\"Likud\"&gt;Likud&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Israeli%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2006 elections&lt;/a&gt; Solodkin resigned from the Knesset in order to join Kadima. She gained 6th place on the party's list and was re-elected. However, in protest at not being appointed a Minister despite her high position on Kadima's list, she was absent from the swearing-in ceremony of the new government. Her absence from the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Israel\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; was unpopular with many Russian immigrants.\nShe called for foreign agricultural workers to be replaced with &lt;a href=\"Beta%20Israel\"&gt;Ethiopian immigrants&lt;/a&gt;, and demanded that &lt;a href=\"Ariel%20Toaff\"&gt;Ariel Toaff&lt;/a&gt; be put on trial for his book about &lt;a href=\"blood%20libel\"&gt;blood libel&lt;/a&gt;. She has also said that &lt;a href=\"Ehud%20Olmert\"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; should resign over the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Lebanon%20War\"&gt;2006 Lebanon War&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe retained her seat in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Israeli%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2009 elections&lt;/a&gt; after being placed tenth on the party's list. On 5 December 2012, in the days leading up to the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Israeli%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2013 elections&lt;/a&gt;, while polls showed Kadima either barely getting into the Knesset or not even passing the threshold, Solodkin announced she would not contest the elections."
