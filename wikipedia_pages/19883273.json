    "text": "Like Omigod! The 80s Pop Culture Box (Totally) is a seven-disc, 142-track box set of &lt;a href=\"popular%20music\"&gt;popular music&lt;/a&gt; hits of the 1980s. Released by &lt;a href=\"Rhino%20Entertainment\"&gt;Rhino Records&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, the box set was based on the success of \"\", Rhino's box set covering the 1970s. Original release sets had a 3D rubber cover. Later releases had a flat, printed cover.\n\"Like Omigod!\" includes a 90-page booklet of cultural comment, a timeline for the decade, and liner notes for the tracks included in the set. As does \"Have a Nice Decade\", the tracks tend to be from the lesser-known artists who were &lt;a href=\"one-hit%20wonder\"&gt;one-hit wonder&lt;/a&gt;s, although music from the best-selling artists of the era are also included. In addition, many of the 1980s musical styles\u2014&lt;a href=\"Rock%20music\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"country%20pop\"&gt;country pop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20wave%20music\"&gt;new wave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"funk\"&gt;funk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rhythm%20and%20blues\"&gt;rhythm and blues&lt;/a&gt;\u2014are represented.\nA majority of the tracks on the first 5\u00bd discs focus on 1980\u20131985, while the remaining tracks cover the period of 1986\u20131989.\nMastering.\nThis compilation was produced by David McLees, Bill Inglot and Gordon Skene, and like many CDs of the period, contains very loud and dynamically compressed mastering, so much to the point that many of the tracks pump from the extremely loud \"brickwalling\" effect that all the tracks have been processed through.
