    "text": "The Joint Warfare Establishment was a British military training establishment based at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Sarum\"&gt;Old Sarum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wiltshire\"&gt;Wiltshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Joint Warfare Establishment was formed at Old Sarum in Wiltshire on 31 March 1963 when the &lt;a href=\"School%20of%20Land/Air%20Warfare\"&gt;School of Land/Air Warfare&lt;/a&gt; (formed in 1947 at Old Sarum) was merged with the Amphibious Warfare School (formerly based at &lt;a href=\"Poole\"&gt;Poole&lt;/a&gt;). Its first commandant was Air Vice-Marshal Cecil Weir. Its role was to teach officers from the three services to work as one unit when fighting local wars; typical courses lasted 10 days at a time and each course was attended by about 50 officers mainly of &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; rank. However the establishment also had more specialist roles as the training centre for British &lt;a href=\"psychological%20warfare\"&gt;psychological warfare&lt;/a&gt; operations and as the training centre for forward air controller training. The establishment was disbanded in 1978 when such courses were transferred to the Joint Warfare Wing of the &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Service%20Defence%20College\"&gt;National Defence College&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Latimer%2C%20Buckinghamshire\"&gt;Latimer&lt;/a&gt;."
