    "text": "The Mounted Chasseurs of the Imperial Guard () constituted a &lt;a href=\"light%20cavalry\"&gt;light cavalry&lt;/a&gt; regiment in the Consular, then &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard%20%28Napoleon%20I%29\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"French%20Consulate\"&gt;French Consulate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;First French Empire&lt;/a&gt; respectively. They were the second senior \"Old Guard\" cavalry regiment of the Imperial Guard, after the \"&lt;a href=\"Grenadiers%20%C3%A0%20Cheval%20de%20la%20Garde%20Imp%C3%A9riale\"&gt;Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval&lt;/a&gt;\". The regiment had its origins in the Guides raised by General Bonaparte during his &lt;a href=\"Italian%20campaigns%20of%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars%23Bonaparte%27s%20war\"&gt;Italian Campaign of 1796&lt;/a&gt;. It was the Chasseurs that usually provided personal escort to &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;, and he often wore the uniform of the regiment in recognition of this service. The regiment was not only known for its lavish uniform, but its combat history as well.\nService history.\nWhen at the end of August 1799 Bonaparte left &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; to return to France he took with him a detachment of 180 \"Guides \u00e0 cheval\" and 125 \"Guides \u00e0 pied\". The men chosen were the most devoted veterans from each company. Soon after the \"&lt;a href=\"coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"18%20Brumaire\"&gt;18 Brumaire&lt;/a&gt; the Guides, who had stayed in the south of France, were summoned to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and quartered in the \"&lt;a href=\"Casern\"&gt;Casern&lt;/a&gt;e de Babylone\". A decree of 28 November reorganized the \"Garde du Directoire\" as the \"&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard%20%28Napoleon%20I%29%23History\"&gt;Garde des Consuls&lt;/a&gt;\", but it makes no mention of the Chasseurs.\nBy a decree of 3 January 1800 a &lt;a href=\"Company%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; of \"Chasseurs \u00e0 cheval\" was created. Its commanding officer was Napoleon's stepson, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28land%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Beauharnais\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais&lt;/a&gt;, who was promoted &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; on 5 March. The strength was 4 officers and 113 men, the latter being chosen from the Guides who had returned from Egypt, and 112 were veterans of the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20campaigns%20of%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars%23Bonaparte%27s%20war\"&gt;Italian Campaign of 1796&lt;/a&gt;. The cavalry of the \"Garde Consulaire\", two squadrons of \"&lt;a href=\"Grenadiers%20%C3%A0%20Cheval%20de%20la%20Garde%20Imp%C3%A9riale\"&gt;Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval&lt;/a&gt;\" and the company of chasseurs, was commanded by \"&lt;a href=\"Chef%20de%20brigade\"&gt;Chef de brigade&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Bessi%C3%A8res\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Bessi\u00e8res&lt;/a&gt;. In May the company left Paris for &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. It crossed the &lt;a href=\"Great%20St%20Bernard%20Pass\"&gt;Great St Bernard Pass&lt;/a&gt; and was heavily engaged at the &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Marengo\"&gt;battle of Marengo&lt;/a&gt; (14 June) losing 70 out of its 115 horses. At the end of the campaign the corps returned to Paris. By a consular decree of 8 September it was augmented, becoming a squadron of two companies (troops) and 234 men.\nBy a decree of 6 August 1801 the corps was increased to a headquarters and two &lt;a href=\"Squadron%20%28army%29\"&gt;squadrons&lt;/a&gt;. The staff was: 1 \"&lt;a href=\"chef%20d%27escadron\"&gt;chef d'escadron&lt;/a&gt;\", 1 \"&lt;a href=\"Warrant%20Officer\"&gt;adjudant-major&lt;/a&gt;\", 2 \"&lt;a href=\"Standard-bearer\"&gt;porte-\u00e9tendard&lt;/a&gt;\", 1 \"&lt;a href=\"Trumpet\"&gt;brigadier-trompette&lt;/a&gt;\", and 4 \"ma\u00eetres-ouvriers\". At the end of September the remainder of the Guides got back from Egypt and were merged into the corps. By a decree of 14 November the chasseurs became a regiment. In theory the commanding officer was to be a \"Chef de brigade\", but in fact Bonaparte retained \"Chef d'escadron\" Beauharnais in command.\nBy decree of 8 March 1802 the Headquarters was increased. It now included four standard-bearers, a &lt;a href=\"trumpet%20major\"&gt;trumpet major&lt;/a&gt;, two trumpet corporals and a \"timbalier\" (&lt;a href=\"Timpani\"&gt;kettle-drummer&lt;/a&gt;). By decree of 1 October the regiment was increased to four squadrons, with a total strength of 56 officers and 959 men. Beauharnais was promoted \"Chef de brigade\" (13 October), and now had as his squadron commanders &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Louis%20de%20Morlan\"&gt;Morland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20Dahlmann\"&gt;Nicolas Dahlmann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Auguste%20de%20Beurmann\"&gt;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste de Beurmann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Damingue\"&gt;Joseph Damingue&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; man who had distinguished himself at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bridge%20of%20Arcole\"&gt;Bridge of Arcole&lt;/a&gt; in 1796.\nFrom 22 March 1803, when summer training (\"travail d'\u00e9t\u00e9\") began, the men were to parade on horseback every Monday and Thursday at 7.30 a.m. precisely on the &lt;a href=\"Champ%20de%20Mars\"&gt;Champ de Mars&lt;/a&gt;. Every Wednesday at the same hour they went through the foot exercise. In winter the parades seem to have been at 9.00 a.m. &lt;a href=\"Human%20swimming\"&gt;Swimming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Watercraft%20rowing\"&gt;rowing&lt;/a&gt; were among the exercises carried out in 1802 and 1803.\nBy a decree of 21 January 1804 the regiment was given a major who was to rank with the &lt;a href=\"colonel\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;s of the line. The intrepid Morland was given this appointment. By the same decree the company of &lt;a href=\"Mamluk\"&gt;Mamluk&lt;/a&gt;s was attached to the regiment. By an Order of the Day of 18 May the \"Garde des Consuls\" became the \"&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard%20%28Napoleon%20I%29\"&gt;Garde Imp\u00e9riale&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOn 13 May 1805 Beauharnais was made &lt;a href=\"Viceroy\"&gt;Viceroy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%28Napoleonic%29\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, but he retained nominal command of the regiment until about 1808. Morland now became the actual commanding officer with the title of \"Colonel Commandant en second\", and Dahlmann was promoted major. On 17 September a squadron of \"v\u00e9lites\" (four companies) was created. It seems to have been intended as a kind of holding reinforcement unit. The regiment and the Mamluks greatly distinguished themselves at the &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Austerlitz\"&gt;battle of Austerlitz&lt;/a&gt; (2 December), where two squadrons and the Mamluks were led to the charge by Napoleon's senior &lt;a href=\"aide-de-camp\"&gt;aide-de-camp&lt;/a&gt;, General &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Rapp\"&gt;Rapp&lt;/a&gt;, inflicting heavy casualties on the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Russian Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; and capturing Prince &lt;a href=\"Nikolay%20Repnin-Volkonsky\"&gt;Repnin&lt;/a&gt;, the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Chevalier%20Guard%20Regiment\"&gt;Chevalier Guard&lt;/a&gt;. At Austerlitz the Chasseurs suffered 19 officer casualties, including Colonel Morland, killed, and three squadron commanders wounded. Dahlmann now succeeded Morland, and &lt;a href=\"Claude-%C3%89tienne%20Guyot\"&gt;Claude-\u00c9tienne Guyot&lt;/a&gt; became major.\nThe regiment missed the &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Jena\"&gt;battle of Jena&lt;/a&gt; (14 October 1806), where the 1st &lt;a href=\"Hussar\"&gt;Hussar&lt;/a&gt;s had the privilege of escorting the Emperor. The Chasseurs did, however, take part in Napoleon's triumphal entry into &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Eylau\"&gt;Eylau&lt;/a&gt; (8 February 1807) the regiment took part in &lt;a href=\"Joachim%20Murat\"&gt;Murat&lt;/a&gt;'s great charge of 80 squadrons, which relieved the pressure on the French centre at the crisis of the battle. Seventeen of the officers were hit. In addition Dahlmann was mortally wounded. He had recently been promoted general (30 December 1806), but having no command he asked to be allowed to lead his old regiment and fell at their head. Major Guyot commanded the regiment for the rest of the year, and &lt;a href=\"Nicolas-Marin%20Thiry\"&gt;Thiry&lt;/a&gt; was also promoted major (16 February).\nOn 18 January 1808 \"&lt;a href=\"G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral%20de%20Brigade\"&gt;G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Brigade&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Lefebvre-Desnouettes\"&gt;Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes&lt;/a&gt; replaced Dahlmann in command of the regiment. The regiment was in &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; when the populace &lt;a href=\"Dos%20de%20Mayo%20Uprising\"&gt;rose on 2 May&lt;/a&gt; and eight of the officers, including Major &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Daumesnil\"&gt;Pierre Daumesnil&lt;/a&gt;, were wounded as well as five officers of the Mamluks. The regiment took part in General &lt;a href=\"Louis-Pierre%20Montbrun\"&gt;Montbrun&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Somosierra\"&gt;charge up the road at Somosierra&lt;/a&gt; (30 November) but lost no officers for the Spanish gunners only managed to get off one salvo before the Polish and French cavalry got amongst them with the sabre. (This was the second charge, not the one in which the 3rd squadron of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%201st%20Light%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20of%20the%20Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;First Regiment of Polish \"Chevau-L\u00e9gers\"&lt;/a&gt; was practically wiped out.)\nOn 28 November Napoleon, engaged in pressing the retreat of Sir &lt;a href=\"John%20Moore%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29\"&gt;John Moore&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"A%20Coru%C3%B1a\"&gt;Corunna&lt;/a&gt;, rode ahead of his army into the village of &lt;a href=\"Valderas\"&gt;Valderas&lt;/a&gt;, which the British had quit but two hours previously. He was accompanied only by his staff and a squadron of the chasseurs. When &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20of%20France\"&gt;Marshal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Ney\"&gt;Ney&lt;/a&gt; found that the Emperor had thus exposed himself he said to him: \"Sire, I thank Your Majesty for acting as my advance guard.\" That it had been imprudent was proved next day (29 December) when General Lefebvre-Desnouettes caught up with the British rearguard, forded the &lt;a href=\"River%20Esla\"&gt;River Esla&lt;/a&gt; and drove in their pickets, only to be rudely counter-attacked by Lord &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Paget%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Anglesey\"&gt;Paget&lt;/a&gt; (the Uxbridge of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Waterloo\"&gt;Waterloo&lt;/a&gt; fame), who &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Benavente\"&gt;led his men under cover of the houses of Benavente&lt;/a&gt; to assail the French flank. Lefebvre-Desnouettes, wounded by a pistol shot, was taken prisoner. The regiment had 6 other officers hurt and 2 captains taken, besides 55 chasseurs killed and wounded and 73 captured. To be outflanked and cut up in this fashion was a rude and novel experience for the Emperor's \"favourite children\". The British cavalry who achieved this feat were the 10th Hussars with pickets of the 18th and the 3rd Hussars of the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20German%20Legion\"&gt;King's German Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Their losses amounted to no more than 50. It was this affair more than anything that convinced the Emperor that Moore had slipped from his clutches. It was time to return to France.\nThe regiment was at home again by the end of February 1809. About this time it absorbed the \"&lt;a href=\"Chevau-l%C3%A9ger\"&gt;Chevau-l\u00e9ger&lt;/a&gt;s\" of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duke\"&gt;Grand Duke&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Berg\"&gt;Berg&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the \"Guides de Murat\" (11 January) and the \"Guides du Mar\u00e9chal &lt;a href=\"%C3%89douard%20Adolphe%20Casimir%20Joseph%20Mortier\"&gt;Mortier&lt;/a&gt;\" (1 February). On 5 June Major Guyot became \"colonel commandant en second\". Thiry was made \"g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade\" in the line, and, on the 13th, Daumesnil and &lt;a href=\"Hercule%20Corbineau\"&gt;Hercule Corbineau&lt;/a&gt; were promoted majors. At &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Wagram\"&gt;Wagram&lt;/a&gt; the Guard cavalry supported the right flank of &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20MacDonald\"&gt;MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;'s great column which struck the decisive blow. The regiment suffered at Wagram (6 July) having 5 officers killed and 10 wounded, including the two newly promoted majors, each of whom lost a leg. Colonel Guyot was promoted \"g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade\" (9 August), retaining the command, and Colonel &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Dieudonn%C3%A9%20Lion\"&gt;Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 Lion&lt;/a&gt; (14th Chasseurs) was brought in as third major of the corps.\n1810 was a quiet year, with only one officer wounded escorting prisoners in &lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20War\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. On 1 August 1811 the regiment was increased to five squadrons and the \"v\u00e9lites\" were done away with. During the year squadrons were sent successively to serve with the divisions of the Garde in Spain. Guyot was promoted \"&lt;a href=\"g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral%20de%20division\"&gt;g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division&lt;/a&gt;\", but still retained the command. To replace Corbineau and Daumesnil as majors the regiment received Colonel &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Charles%20Jean%20Pierre%20Marie%20d%27Avrange%20d%27Haug%C3%A9ranville\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois d'Haug\u00e9ranville&lt;/a&gt; (6 August) and General Baron &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9mi%20Joseph%20Isidore%20Exelmans\"&gt;Exelmans&lt;/a&gt; (24 December).\nOn 6 May 1812 General Lefebvre-Desnouettes, who had escaped by breaking his parole, returned from his captivity in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and resumed command of the regiment. The chasseurs, five squadrons and the company of Mamluks, went through the &lt;a href=\"French%20invasion%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Russian campaign&lt;/a&gt;, but though they lost 500 men, they only had 10 officers hit. At &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Borodino\"&gt;Borodino&lt;/a&gt; they had no officer casualties at all. But on 25 October, the day after the &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Maloyaroslavets\"&gt;battle of Maloyaroslavets&lt;/a&gt; two squadrons, escorting the Emperor on a reconnaissance, were sharply engaged and had 4 officers wounded. A body of &lt;a href=\"Cossack\"&gt;Cossack&lt;/a&gt;s appeared suddenly from a wood and charged straight at Napoleon. General Rapp and the escort managed to beat them off, but not before one had fought his way to within twenty yards of the Emperor. From this day forth, haunted by the fear of captivity, he always carried a bag of poison on a string about his neck. The regiment's losses in this campaign must on the whole be attributed not so much to the fighting as to the Russian climate.\nIn 1813 the regiment was expanded from five to nine squadrons. The first five of these remained under the Old Guard while the newly raised 6th through 9th squadrons formed part of the Young Guard and in 1815 were redesigned as the \"2e r\u00e9giment de chasseurs de la Garde imp\u00e9riale\"\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//centjours.mont-saint-jean.com/uniformes_uniteFR.php%3Funiformes%3D60%26amp%3Bdrapeau%3D\"&gt;Uniform of the 2nd squadron of the Chasseurs-\u00e0-Cheval, in 1815, on \"Les uniformes pendant la campagne des Cent Jours\"&lt;/a&gt;"
