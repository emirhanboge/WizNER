It is found near the &lt;a href=\"Malta%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Malta International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and has been inhabited since &lt;a href=\"pre-history\"&gt;pre-history&lt;/a&gt;. The parish church is dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20of%20Noblac\"&gt;Saint Leonard&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team of the village is the &lt;a href=\"Kirkop%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Kirkop United Football Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology and population.\nThe original name of the village was Casal Prokopju, and is retrieved from the registers of the Maltese militia that existed prior to the rule of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20St.%20John\"&gt;Order of St. John&lt;/a&gt;. Through generations, the local population corrupted the original name and was changed to \"Kirkop\".\nThe name of the village comes from the surname of a rich family\nHistory.\nPunic remains of catacombs are found around the village of Kirkop with some of them remain unexplored, and their exploration has been shelved.\nIn 1969 Anthropologist &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Boissevain\"&gt;Jeremy Boissevain&lt;/a&gt; published a research on the social fabric of the village in his book \"Hal Farrug: a village in Malta\". Boissevain claims that the people of \u0126al Kirkop have lived in the area for centuries because of his assumed comparable bloodline with ancient Phoenician. The Phoenicians occupied the Maltese islands around 700 B.C..\nKirkop was part of a larger community, as part of the &lt;a href=\"St%20Mary%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Bir%20Miftu%C4%A7\"&gt;parish of Bir Miftu\u0127&lt;/a&gt;, in the Middle Ages until the Early Modern period. However on 29 May 1592, it was declared a parish on its own right.\nThe village had a population of 2,260 people in March 2011. By March 2014 this decreased slightly to 2,191 people.\nPlaces, buildings and structures.\nIn Kirkop, one finds the Menhir monolith, which has become the symbol of the village, and a number of Paleo-Christian Catacombs.\nOther notorious &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20monuments%20in%20Kirkop\"&gt;buildings and structures are listed monuments&lt;/a&gt; which include; the Church of the Annunciation, the Parish Church of St. Leonard, the Chapel St. Nicholas at the cemetery, a cross column (Is-Salib tad-Dejma), and a number of niches scattered around the village. There are two WWII shelters below street level.\nThere are two band clubs, the St. Leonard Band Club and the St. Joseph Band Club, which are used as recreation.\nKirkop is home to an &lt;a href=\"STMicroelectronics\"&gt;STMicroelectronics&lt;/a&gt; plant, whose production accounts for 60% of &lt;a href=\"Economy%20of%20Malta\"&gt;national exports&lt;/a&gt;."
