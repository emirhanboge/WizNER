    "text": "In investment analysis, betavexity is a form of &lt;a href=\"convexity%20in%20economics\"&gt;convexity&lt;/a&gt; that is specific to the &lt;a href=\"beta%20coefficient\"&gt;beta coefficient&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"long%20tail\"&gt;long tail&lt;/a&gt;ed investment (i.e. mortality risk). It is similar in nature to &lt;a href=\"bond%20convexity\"&gt;bond convexity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gamma%20%28finance%29\"&gt;gamma&lt;/a&gt; that are exhibited in financial products such as &lt;a href=\"Bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Option%20%28finance%29\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; but is specific to portfolios replicating indices of shorter maturities.\nInvestment horizon.\nCertain investors such as insurance companies have longer-term investment horizons than hedge funds which allow for investments in assets that have longer maturities. As a result, these investors can invest in assets that have an inherent return component linked to the dynamic of the term of the investment."
