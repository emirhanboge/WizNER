    "text": "In the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Mormon\"&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/a&gt;, Sam was the third son of &lt;a href=\"Lehi%20%28Book%20of%20Mormon%29\"&gt;Lehi&lt;/a&gt;, and elder brother to the &lt;a href=\"prophet\"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nephi%2C%20son%20of%20Lehi\"&gt;Nephi&lt;/a&gt;. Early in the Book of Mormon, Nephi confided in Sam. Lehi saw Sam in his vision of the tree of life, noting that he ate the precious fruit, symbolizing the righteousness of Sam, and that he would be saved. Upon the death of Lehi, Sam followed his brother Nephi in the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Nephites\"&gt;Nephites&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong &lt;a href=\"The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints\"&gt;LDS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"linguistics\"&gt;linguists&lt;/a&gt;, the leading theory of the origin of the name \"Sam\" is that it is most likely a &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20language\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dialect\"&gt;dialect&lt;/a&gt;al form of \"&lt;a href=\"Shem\"&gt;Shem&lt;/a&gt;\"."
