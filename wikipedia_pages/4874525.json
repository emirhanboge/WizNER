It is one of the most famous and impressive forts in the state and has been known through history as the Svangiri or the \"golden mount\".This fort is a symbol of the valor of Songra Chauhans. The Songra Chauhans made their name all over the world by defeating a cruel Turkic emperor like Alauddin. Veer Veeramdev and Rao Kanhadded Dev defeated a power like Alauddin from this fort to protect their motherland with their valorous might. This fort is a symbol of the valor of Songra Chauhans.With the blessings of Kuldevi Maa Ashapura who is also known as Modara Mata. Chauhan gave a different direction to Jalore and to the fort.\nHistory.\nThe precise year of its construction is not known. However, it is believed to be have been built between the 8th and the 10th centuries.\nJalore was ruled by a &lt;a href=\"Paramara%20dynasty%23Branches%20and%20claimed%20descendants\"&gt;Paramara branch&lt;/a&gt; in the 10th century. &lt;a href=\"Kirtipala\"&gt;Kirtipala&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest son of &lt;a href=\"Alhanadeva\"&gt;Alhana&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of &lt;a href=\"Nadol\"&gt;Nadol&lt;/a&gt;, established the &lt;a href=\"Chahamanas%20of%20Jalor\"&gt;Jalore line of Chauhans&lt;/a&gt;. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181 and took the clan name Songara after the place. His son, &lt;a href=\"Samarasimha\"&gt;Samarasimha&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded him in 1182. After him, &lt;a href=\"Udayasimha\"&gt;Udayasimha&lt;/a&gt; became the ruler. The rule of Udayasimha was a golden period in the history of Jalore. He was a powerful and able ruler. He ruled over a large area. He captured back &lt;a href=\"Nadol\"&gt;Nadol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mandore\"&gt;Mandore&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Muslims\"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt;. In 1228 &lt;a href=\"Iltutmish\"&gt;Iltutmish&lt;/a&gt; circled Jalore however Udayasimha offered stiff resistance. He was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Chachigadeva\"&gt;Chachigadeva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Samantasimha\"&gt;Samantasimha&lt;/a&gt; respectively. After Samantasimha his son &lt;a href=\"Kanhadadeva\"&gt;Kanhadadeva&lt;/a&gt; became ruler of Jalore.\nDuring the reign of Kanhadadeva, &lt;a href=\"Alauddin%20Khalji%27s%20conquest%20of%20Jalore\"&gt;Jalore was conquered in 1311&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ala%20ud%20din%20Khilji\"&gt;Ala ud din Khilji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Delhi%20Sultanate\"&gt;Sultan of Delhi&lt;/a&gt;.\nJalore was conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Rathore\"&gt;Rathore&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ratlam%20State\"&gt;Ratlam&lt;/a&gt; and remained a part of &lt;a href=\"Jodhpur%20State\"&gt;Jodhpur State&lt;/a&gt; until it integrated to India.\nPhysical features.\nJalore fort is perched atop a steep and perpendicular hill. It commands the town from rocky outcrop 336m (1200 ft) high fortified with a wall and bastions with cannon mounted upon them.\nThe fort has four gigantic gates however it is approachable only from one side, after a two-mile (3 km) long serpentine ascent. The approach to the fort is from the north, up a steep, slippery road through three rows of fortification to a single rampart wall 6.1m (20ft) high. It takes an hour to climb up. The fort is built on the lines of traditional &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20architecture\"&gt;Hindu architecture&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Main Poles or Gates\nBuilt into the front wall are four mighty gates or pols that lead into the fort: The Suraj Pol, Dhruv Pol, Chand Pol and the Sire Pol. The Suraj Pol or the \"Sun gate\" is built so that the first rays of the morning sun enter through this gateway. It is an impressive gate with a small watch tower built over it. The Dhruv Pol is rather simple looking compared to Suraj Pol.\nAttractions inside the Fort.\nThe mahal or \"the residential palace\" inside the fort is now desolated, and what is left of it are the ruined symmetrical walls with huge rock formations around it. The cut-stone walls of the fort are still intact at many places. There are some drinking water tanks in the fort.\nHindu Temples.\nThere is an old &lt;a href=\"Shiva\"&gt;Shiva&lt;/a&gt; temple, a temple devoted to Lord Shiva. It was built by Kanhaddev Ruler of Jalore. Same was renovated by Mah Singh Ruler of &lt;a href=\"Jodhpur\"&gt;Jodhpur&lt;/a&gt; and built a Samadhi Mandir of Shri Jalandharnath. Recently this temple renovated again by Shri Santinathji Maharaj in 2005 with all facility for devotees. A triple temple dedicated to Amba Mata, Ashapuri and &lt;a href=\"Hanuman\"&gt;Hanuman&lt;/a&gt; ji is also located within the fort premises.\nThe Islamic Mosques.\nThe Kila Masjid (Fort Mosque) within the fort is also noteworthy as they demonstrate the widespread influence of the architectural decorations associated with the &lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20people\"&gt;Gujarati&lt;/a&gt; styles of the period (i.e. late 16th century). This is because it was built by destroying existing Hindu temple.\nAnother shrine in the fort is that of Saint Rehmad Ali Baba. Near the main gate, there is the tomb of Malik Shah, a noted Mohammedan saint.\nThe Jain Temples.\nJalore is also a place of pilgrimage for &lt;a href=\"Jain\"&gt;Jain&lt;/a&gt;s and the famous Jain temples of &lt;a href=\"Rishabha%20%28Jain%20tirthankar%29\"&gt;Adinath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mahavira\"&gt;Mahavira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Parshvnath\"&gt;Parshvnath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shantinath\"&gt;Shantinath&lt;/a&gt; are located here.\nThe oldest temple is that of &lt;a href=\"Rishabha%20%28Jain%20tirthankar%29\"&gt;Adinath&lt;/a&gt;, which existed as far back as in the 8th century. The &lt;a href=\"mandapa\"&gt;mandapa&lt;/a&gt; was subsequently built in 1182 A.D. by Yasovira, a &lt;a href=\"Srimali\"&gt;Srimali&lt;/a&gt; vaishya. The temple stands out the most among the dark fort walls and rocky surrounding. Built in white marble this imposing structure is quite a sight.\nThe temple of &lt;a href=\"Parsvanath\"&gt;Parsvanath&lt;/a&gt; was built by the ruler of Jalore and then rebuilt in 1785 A.D. This temple has a spectacular toran or an archway and a golden \"cupola\" in the hall meant for theatre performances. Built near the Bal Pol, which is situated northwest of the fort.\nThe temple of &lt;a href=\"Mahavira\"&gt;Mahavira&lt;/a&gt; was also known as Chandanavihara Nahadarao, named after a &lt;a href=\"Pratihara\"&gt;Pratihara&lt;/a&gt; ruler and a hero of Jain tradition who built it in the 14th century.\nThe temples of Santinatha and the Ashtapads are believed to have existed in the 13th century."
