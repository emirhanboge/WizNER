    "text": "Sunderland Association Football Club (, ) is an English professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in the city of &lt;a href=\"Sunderland\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyne%20and%20Wear\"&gt;Tyne and Wear&lt;/a&gt;. Sunderland plays in &lt;a href=\"EFL%20League%20One\"&gt;League One&lt;/a&gt;, the third tier of English football. Since its formation in 1879, the club has won six top-flight (&lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt;, now the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;) titles (1892, 1893, 1895, 1902, 1913, and 1936), and has finished runners-up five times. The club has also won the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; twice (1937 and 1973) and been runners-up twice (1913 and 1992), as well as winning the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Community%20Shield\"&gt;FA Charity Shield&lt;/a&gt; in 1936 and being finalists the following year. Sunderland have also been &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Football League Cup&lt;/a&gt; finalists in 1985 and 2014.\nSunderland play their home games at the 49,000-capacity &lt;a href=\"all-seater%20stadium\"&gt;all-seater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stadium%20of%20Light\"&gt;Stadium of Light&lt;/a&gt; having moved from &lt;a href=\"Roker%20Park\"&gt;Roker Park&lt;/a&gt; in 1997. The original ground capacity was 42,000 which was increased to 49,000 following expansion in 2000. The club have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt;, with whom they have contested the &lt;a href=\"Tyne%E2%80%93Wear%20derby\"&gt;Tyne\u2013Wear derby&lt;/a&gt; since 1898. The club have played in red and white-striped shirts and black shorts for nearly the entirety of its history.\nHistory.\nEarly years and the \"Team of All Talents\" (1879\u20131908).\nThe club was founded as Sunderland and District Teachers A.F.C. by &lt;a href=\"schoolmaster\"&gt;schoolmaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"James%20Allan%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201857%29\"&gt;James Allan&lt;/a&gt; in what has commonly been believed to be October 1879. However, evidence suggests that the club was not formally created until a year later, on 25 September 1880. It was renamed as Sunderland A.F.C. and became open to more than just school teachers in October 1880.\nSunderland joined &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;The Football League&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1890%E2%80%9391%20Sunderland%20A.F.C.%20season\"&gt;1890\u201391 season&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Watson%20%28football%20manager%29\"&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/a&gt; became Sunderland's first manager when he was appointed in 1888. During the late 19th century, they were declared the \"Team of All Talents\" by &lt;a href=\"William%20McGregor%20%28football%29\"&gt;William McGregor&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the league, after a 7\u20132 win against &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;. Sunderland won the league championship in the &lt;a href=\"1891%E2%80%9392%20Sunderland%20A.F.C.%20season\"&gt;1891\u201392 season&lt;/a&gt;, one season after joining The Football League, and this performance led \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times\"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;\" to describe the players as \"a wonderfully fine team\". Sunderland successfully defended the title the following season, aided by their Scottish &lt;a href=\"forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;centre forward&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Campbell%20%28footballer%20born%201870%29\"&gt;John Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, who broke the 30-goal mark for the second time in consecutive seasons. In the process, they became the first team to score 100 goals in a season, a feat not matched until &lt;a href=\"1919%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1919\u201320&lt;/a&gt;.\nSunderland came close to winning a third successive league championship in the &lt;a href=\"1893%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1893\u201394 season&lt;/a&gt;, finishing second behind Aston Villa. However, they regained the title in the &lt;a href=\"1894%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1894\u201395 season&lt;/a&gt;, with Campbell becoming league top scorer for the third time. Sunderland then beat Scottish champions &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Heart of Midlothian&lt;/a&gt; in a game described as the \"&lt;a href=\"1895%20World%20Championship%20%28football%29\"&gt;World Championship&lt;/a&gt;\" match. Their goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Ned%20Doig\"&gt;Ned Doig&lt;/a&gt; set a 19th-century world record by not conceding any goals in 87 of his 290 top division appearances (30%). From 1886 until 1898, Sunderland's home ground was in &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20Road\"&gt;Newcastle Road&lt;/a&gt;. In 1898, the club moved to what would become their home for almost a century, &lt;a href=\"Roker%20Park\"&gt;Roker Park&lt;/a&gt;. Initially the ground had a capacity of 30,000. \nAfter taking Sunderland to three English League championship titles manager Watson resigned at the end of the 1895\u201396 season, in order to join &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Campbell%20%28football%20manager%29\"&gt;Robert Campbell&lt;/a&gt; replaced him. Campbell did not achieve the same playing success as Watson, as Sunderland failed to win any titles in his three seasons at the club. \nScotsman &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Mackie\"&gt;Alex Mackie&lt;/a&gt; replaced Campbell as manager for the 1899 season. Following a second-place finish in 1900\u201301, the club won their fourth league title in the &lt;a href=\"1901%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1901\u201302 season&lt;/a&gt;, and followed this up with victory in the &lt;a href=\"Sheriff%20of%20London%20Charity%20Shield\"&gt;Sheriff of London Charity Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn December 1902, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Bridgett\"&gt;Arthur Bridgett&lt;/a&gt; joined Sunderland. He went on to captain the \"Black Cats\" for ten years and gain eleven England caps, making him the club's second most-capped England international behind &lt;a href=\"David%20Watson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201946%29\"&gt;Dave Watson&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther league championship titles (1908\u20131945).\nOn 5 December 1908, Sunderland achieved their highest ever league win, 9\u20131 against north-east rivals Newcastle United. Under Irish manager &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Kyle\"&gt;Bob Kyle&lt;/a&gt; and with Scottish &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Thomson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201878%29\"&gt;Charles Thomson&lt;/a&gt; as captain, the club won the league again in 1913, but lost their first &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup%20final\"&gt;FA Cup final&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 to Aston Villa.\nTwo seasons later the First World War brought the league to a halt. After the league's resumption, Sunderland came close to winning another championship in the &lt;a href=\"1922%E2%80%9323%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1922\u201323 season&lt;/a&gt;, when they were runners-up to Liverpool. They also came close the following season, finishing third. The club escaped relegation from the First Division by one point in the &lt;a href=\"1927%E2%80%9328%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1927\u201328 season&lt;/a&gt; despite 35 goals from &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Halliday\"&gt;Dave Halliday&lt;/a&gt;. Halliday improved his goal scoring to 43 goals in 42 games the following season, an all-time Sunderland record for goals scored in a single season.\nThe club's sixth league championship came in the &lt;a href=\"1935%E2%80%9336%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1935\u201336&lt;/a&gt; season under Scottish manager &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Cochrane\"&gt;Johnny Cochrane&lt;/a&gt;. They scored 109\u00a0goals during the season, with &lt;a href=\"Raich%20Carter\"&gt;Raich Carter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Gurney\"&gt;Bobby Gurney&lt;/a&gt; each scoring 31. They followed this by winning the Charity Shield against FA Cup winners Arsenal.\nDespite winning the league, the season did not go without tragedy. The young goalkeeper of the team, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Thorpe\"&gt;Jimmy Thorpe&lt;/a&gt;, died as a result of being kicked after he had picked up the ball following a &lt;a href=\"backpass\"&gt;backpass&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;. He continued to take part until the match finished, but collapsed at home and died in hospital four days later. This incident led to a change in the rules, whereby players were no longer allowed to raise their foot to a goalkeeper when he had control of the ball in his arms.\nThey won the FA Cup the following season, after a 3\u20131 victory against Preston North End at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Some football was still played during the Second World War as a morale boosting exercise, in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20War%20Cup\"&gt;Football League War Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Sunderland were finalists in the tournament in &lt;a href=\"1942%20Football%20League%20War%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1942&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Bank of England\" club, financial troubles and three cup finals (1945\u20131995).\nFor Sunderland, the immediate post-war years were characterised by significant spending; the club paid \u00a318,000 (\u00a3 today) for &lt;a href=\"Carlisle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Carlisle United&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ivor%20Broadis\"&gt;Ivor Broadis&lt;/a&gt; in January 1949. Broadis was also Carlisle's manager at the time, and this is the first instance of a player transferring himself to another club. This, along with record-breaking transfer fees to secure the services of &lt;a href=\"Len%20Shackleton\"&gt;Len Shackleton&lt;/a&gt; and the Welsh international &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Ford\"&gt;Trevor Ford&lt;/a&gt;, led to a contemporary nickname, the \"&lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20England%20club\"&gt;Bank of England club&lt;/a&gt;\". The club finished third in the First Division in &lt;a href=\"1949%E2%80%9350%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1950&lt;/a&gt;, their highest finish since the 1936 championship.\nThe late 1950s saw a sharp downturn in Sunderland's fortunes, and the club was once again implicated in a major financial scandal in 1957. Found guilty of making payments to players in excess of the &lt;a href=\"Salary%20cap\"&gt;maximum wage&lt;/a&gt;, they were fined \u00a35,000 (\u00a3 today), and their chairman and three directors were suspended. The following year, Sunderland were &lt;a href=\"promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;relegated&lt;/a&gt; from the highest division for the first time in their 68-year league history.\nSunderland's absence from the top flight lasted six years. After a close call in the previous season, the club was promoted to Division One in 1964 after finishing in second place. At the end of the decade, they were again relegated to the Second Division after finishing 21st.\nSunderland won their last major trophy in 1973, in a 1\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"Don%20Revie\"&gt;Don Revie&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt; in the FA Cup Final. A &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; club at the time, Sunderland won the game thanks mostly to the efforts of their goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Montgomery\"&gt;Jimmy Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Porterfield\"&gt;Ian Porterfield&lt;/a&gt; scored a &lt;a href=\"volley%20%28football%29\"&gt;volley&lt;/a&gt; in the 30th minute to beat Leeds and take the trophy. Since 1973 only two other clubs, &lt;a href=\"Southampton%20F.C.\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt; in 1976, and &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt; in 1980, have equalled Sunderland's achievement of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football.\nBy winning the FA Cup, Sunderland qualified for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the club's only appearance in European competition to date. They beat &lt;a href=\"Vasas%20SC\"&gt;Vasas Budapest&lt;/a&gt; but then lost on aggregate to &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Sporting&lt;/a&gt; of Portugal in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%201973%E2%80%9374%23Second%20round\"&gt;second round&lt;/a&gt;. After spending six seasons in the Second Division, Sunderland were promoted to Division One in the &lt;a href=\"1975%E2%80%9376%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1975\u201376 season&lt;/a&gt;, but were relegated again the following season.\nSunderland appeared in their first &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; final in &lt;a href=\"1985%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, but lost 1\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Norwich City&lt;/a&gt;. In 1987, Sunderland saw one of the lowest points in their history, when they were relegated to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt; of the English league for the first time. Under new chairman &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Murray%20%28businessman%29\"&gt;Bob Murray&lt;/a&gt; and new manager &lt;a href=\"Denis%20Smith%20%28football%20manager%29\"&gt;Denis Smith&lt;/a&gt;, the club was promoted the following season. In 1990, they were promoted back to the top flight in unusual circumstances,losing to &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt; in the play-off final, but Swindon's promotion was revoked after the club was found guilty of financial irregularities and Sunderland were promoted instead. They stayed up for one year before being relegated on the final day of the following season.\nSunderland's next outing in a major final came in &lt;a href=\"1992%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; when, as a Second Division club, they returned to the FA Cup final. There was to be no repeat of the heroics of 1973, as Sunderland lost 2\u20130 to Liverpool.\nNew stadium, promotions and relegations (1995\u20132006).\nIn 1995, they faced the prospect of a return to the third-tier of English football. &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Reid\"&gt;Peter Reid&lt;/a&gt; was brought in as manager, and quickly turned things around. Reid's time in charge had a stabilising effect; he remained manager for seven years. After promotion from Division One in the &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1995\u201396 season&lt;/a&gt;, Sunderland began their first season in the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, but finished third from the bottom and were relegated back to the First Division.\nIn 1997, Sunderland left &lt;a href=\"Roker%20Park\"&gt;Roker Park&lt;/a&gt; and moved to the &lt;a href=\"Stadium%20of%20Light\"&gt;Stadium of Light&lt;/a&gt;, a 42,000-seat arena that, at the time, was the largest stadium built in England after the Second World War. The capacity was later increased to 49,000.\nSunderland returned to the Premier League as First Division champions in 1999 with a then-record 105 points. At the end of the season Sunderland finished seventh, with &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Phillips%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Kevin Phillips&lt;/a&gt; winning the &lt;a href=\"European%20Golden%20Shoe\"&gt;European Golden Shoe&lt;/a&gt; in his first top-flight season, scoring 30 goals.\nAnother seventh-place finish in the 2000\u201301 season was followed by two less successful seasons, and they were relegated to the second-tier with a then-record low 19 points in 2003. Former &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; manager &lt;a href=\"Mick%20McCarthy\"&gt;Mick McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; took over at the club, and, in 2005, he took Sunderland up as champions for the third time in less than 10 years. However, the club's stay in the top flight was short-lived as Sunderland were once again relegated, this time with a new record-low total of 15 points. McCarthy left the club in mid-season, and he was replaced temporarily by former Sunderland player &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Ball\"&gt;Kevin Ball&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrumaville Consortium takeover and Ellis Short era (2006\u20132016).\nFollowing Sunderland's relegation from the Premier League, the club was taken over by the Irish &lt;a href=\"Drumaville%20Consortium\"&gt;Drumaville Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, headed by ex-player &lt;a href=\"Niall%20Quinn\"&gt;Niall Quinn&lt;/a&gt;, who appointed former &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; captain &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Keane\"&gt;Roy Keane&lt;/a&gt; as the new manager. Under Keane, the club rose steadily up the table with an unbeaten run of 17 games to win promotion to the Premier League, Following an inconsistent start to the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2008\u201309 season&lt;/a&gt;, Keane resigned. Before the start of the following campaign, Irish-American businessman &lt;a href=\"Ellis%20Short\"&gt;Ellis Short&lt;/a&gt; completed a full takeover of the club, and &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Bruce\"&gt;Steve Bruce&lt;/a&gt; was announced as the next manager on 3 June.\nOne of Bruce's first signings, &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Bent\"&gt;Darren Bent&lt;/a&gt;, cost a club record fee of \u00a310 million, broken a year later when they bought Ghana international &lt;a href=\"Asamoah%20Gyan\"&gt;Asamoah Gyan&lt;/a&gt; for around \u00a313\u00a0million. Sunderland started the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2010\u201311&lt;/a&gt; season strongly, but after Bent left for Aston Villa in January 2011 in a deal potentially worth \u00a324 million, a record transfer fee received for the club, they eventually finished 10th\u00a0\u2014 which was still their highest top-flight finish for 10 years. After being named Sunderland's Young Player of the Year for two seasons in a row, local player &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Henderson\"&gt;Jordan Henderson&lt;/a&gt; was transferred to Liverpool at the end of the 2010\u201311 season, where he went on to win the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; among other achievements.\nShort replaced Quinn as chairman in October 2011, with Quinn initially becoming Director of International Development; he left the club with immediate effect in February 2012. Bruce was sacked in November 2011, and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20O%27Neill\"&gt;Martin O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;. O'Neill was sacked in March 2013 and Italian &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Di%20Canio\"&gt;Paolo Di Canio&lt;/a&gt; was announced as his replacement the following day to widespread controversy. Sunderland went on to avoid relegation with one game to go. Di Canio was sacked after a poor start to the 2013\u201314 season, and reports of a complete breakdown in relations with his players. &lt;a href=\"Gus%20Poyet\"&gt;Gus Poyet&lt;/a&gt; was announced as his replacement, and led Sunderland to the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2014 Football League Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, where they were defeated 3\u20131 by &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;. In March 2015 Poyet was sacked, and veteran Dutchman &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Advocaat\"&gt;Dick Advocaat&lt;/a&gt; was appointed, saving the club from relegation. Eight games into the 2015\u201316 season he resigned from the position. &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Allardyce\"&gt;Sam Allardyce&lt;/a&gt; was appointed the next manager in October 2015, and the club was again saved from relegation at the end of the season.\nBack-to-back relegations and ownership changes (2016\u2013present).\nIn July 2016, Allardyce left the club to be announced as manager for the &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England national team&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"David%20Moyes\"&gt;David Moyes&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as his replacement. Under Moyes, Sunderland made the worst ever start to a Premier League season, taking just two points from their opening 10 matches. The club was relegated for the first time in 10 years at the end of 2016\u201317, finishing bottom of the table, and Moyes resigned. In June 2017, goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Pickford\"&gt;Jordan Pickford&lt;/a&gt;, a product of Sunderland's academy, was transferred to Everton for a fee of \u00a325 million, rising to a possible \u00a330 million; a record for a British goalkeeper.\nFollowing relegation, &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Grayson\"&gt;Simon Grayson&lt;/a&gt; was announced as the new manager. The club made a very poor start to the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20EFL%20Championship\"&gt;2017\u201318 EFL Championship&lt;/a&gt; season (which was documented in the &lt;a href=\"Netflix\"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; series \"&lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20%27Til%20I%20Die\"&gt;Sunderland 'Til I Die&lt;/a&gt;\") and Grayson was sacked at the end of October, &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Coleman%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Chris Coleman&lt;/a&gt; replacing him. In April 2018, after a second consecutive relegation, this time to &lt;a href=\"EFL%20League%20One\"&gt;League One&lt;/a&gt;, the club was sold to a group led by &lt;a href=\"Stewart%20Donald\"&gt;Stewart Donald&lt;/a&gt; and Coleman was released from his contract.\n&lt;a href=\"Jack%20Ross%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201976%29\"&gt;Jack Ross&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as the new manager in May 2018. In the club's first season in League One they finished 5th and reached the play-off final, but lost to &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Charlton Athletic&lt;/a&gt; at Wembley. After a disappointing start to 2019\u201320, Ross was sacked. He was replaced by former Bolton manager &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Parkinson\"&gt;Phil Parkinson&lt;/a&gt;. Sunderland finished the season in 8th place, their lowest ever league position, with the final standings ultimately being determined by points per game due to football's suspension due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.\nParkinson was sacked in November 2020 and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Johnson%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Lee Johnson&lt;/a&gt; the following month. Later that month, the club reached an agreement with &lt;a href=\"Kyril%20Louis-Dreyfus\"&gt;Kyril Louis-Dreyfus&lt;/a&gt; for him to purchase a controlling stake in the club. The takeover was completed on 18 February 2021. In May 2021, the club again fell short of promotion after losing to &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Lincoln City&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20132 on aggregate in the semifinals of the play-offs, meaning that Sunderland would remain in the third tier for a fourth consecutive season.\nColours and crest.\nSunderland played in an all blue &lt;a href=\"Kit%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;strip&lt;/a&gt; from their formation until 1884, when they adopted a red and white halved strip. They assumed the current strip of red and white stripes in the &lt;a href=\"1887%E2%80%9388%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1887\u201388 season&lt;/a&gt;. Their badge included a ship, the upper part of the &lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Sunderland\"&gt;Sunderland coat of arms&lt;/a&gt;, a black cat, and a football in front of Sunderland's red and white stripes. In 1972 the badge was changed, removing the black cat but still including a ship, a football and the background of red and white stripes. This badge was first used on the match day shirt in 1977, replacing the simple black 'SAFC' initials which had been used since 1973. The top section and border of the badge was coloured in blue until 1991, when it changed to black.\nTo coincide with the move from Roker Park to the Stadium of Light in 1997, Sunderland released a new crest divided into four quarters; the upper right and lower left featured their traditional red and white colours, but the ship was omitted. The upper left section features the &lt;a href=\"Penshaw%20Monument\"&gt;Penshaw Monument&lt;/a&gt; and the lower right section shows the &lt;a href=\"Wearmouth%20Bridge\"&gt;Wearmouth Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. A colliery wheel at the top of the crest commemorates County Durham's mining history, and the land the Stadium of Light was built on, formerly the &lt;a href=\"Monkwearmouth%20Colliery\"&gt;Monkwearmouth Colliery&lt;/a&gt;. The crest also contains two lions, the black cats of Sunderland, and a banner displaying the club's motto, \"Consectatio Excellentiae\", which means \"In pursuit of excellence\".\nStadium.\nSunderland have had eight grounds throughout their history; the first was at &lt;a href=\"Blue%20House%20Field\"&gt;Blue House Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hendon%2C%20Sunderland\"&gt;Hendon&lt;/a&gt; in 1879. The ground was close to the place where Sunderland formed, at Hendon Board School; at that time the rent for use of the ground was \u00a310 (\u00a3 today). The club then used a number of fields, one of which was near The Cedars road, before relocating to &lt;a href=\"Groves%20Field\"&gt;Groves Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashbrooke\"&gt;Ashbrooke&lt;/a&gt; in 1882 for one season. The club's third stadium was &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Street\"&gt;Horatio Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Roker\"&gt;Roker&lt;/a&gt;, the first Sunderland stadium north of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Wear\"&gt;River Wear&lt;/a&gt;; the club played a single season there before another move, this time to &lt;a href=\"Abbs%20Field\"&gt;Abbs Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fulwell%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear\"&gt;Fulwell&lt;/a&gt; for two seasons. Abbs Field was notable for being the first Sunderland ground to which they charged admission.\nSunderland moved to &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20Road%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;Newcastle Road&lt;/a&gt; in 1886. By 1898, the ground reached a capacity of 15,000 after renovations, and its rent had risen to \u00a3100 (\u00a3 today) a year. Near the turn of the 20th century, Sunderland needed a bigger stadium. They returned to Roker and set up home in &lt;a href=\"Roker%20Park\"&gt;Roker Park&lt;/a&gt;. It was opened on 10 September 1898, and the home team played a match the same day against Liverpool, which they won. The stadium's capacity increased to 50,000 after redevelopment with architect &lt;a href=\"Archibald%20Leitch\"&gt;Archibald Leitch&lt;/a&gt; in 1913. Sunderland were nearly bankrupted by the cost of renovating the Main Stand, and Roker Park was put up for sale but no further action was taken. On\u00a08 March 1933, an overcrowded Roker Park recorded the highest ever attendance at a Sunderland match, 75,118 against &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt; in a FA Cup sixth round replay. Roker Park suffered a bombing in 1943, in which one corner of the stadium was destroyed. A &lt;a href=\"special%20constable\"&gt;special constable&lt;/a&gt; was killed while patrolling the stadium. By the 1990s, the stadium was no longer large enough, and had no room for possible expansion. In January 1990, the &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20Report\"&gt;Taylor Report&lt;/a&gt; was released after overcrowding at the &lt;a href=\"Hillsborough%20Stadium\"&gt;Hillsborough Stadium&lt;/a&gt; resulted in 96 deaths, an incident known as the &lt;a href=\"Hillsborough%20Disaster\"&gt;Hillsborough Disaster&lt;/a&gt;. The report recommended that all major stadiums must be converted to an all-seater design. As a result, Roker Park's capacity was reduced. It was demolished in 1997 and a housing estate built in its place. \nIn 1997, Sunderland moved to their present ground, &lt;a href=\"Stadium%20of%20Light\"&gt;Stadium of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Monkwearmouth\"&gt;Monkwearmouth&lt;/a&gt;, which was opened by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Andrew%2C%20Duke%20of%20York\"&gt;Prince Andrew, Duke of York&lt;/a&gt;. Built with an original capacity of 42,000, it hosted its first game against Dutch team &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium bears a similar name to the Portuguese club &lt;a href=\"S.L.%20Benfica\"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt;'s ground &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20da%20Luz\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio da Luz&lt;/a&gt;, albeit in a different language.\nStadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000. A &lt;a href=\"Davy%20lamp\"&gt;Davy lamp&lt;/a&gt; monument stands outside the stadium, and a miners banner was presented to the club by the &lt;a href=\"Durham%20Miners%27%20Association\"&gt;Durham Miners' Association&lt;/a&gt;, as a reminder of the &lt;a href=\"Monkwearmouth%20Colliery\"&gt;Monkwearmouth Colliery&lt;/a&gt; pit the stadium was built on.\nSupporters, rivalries &amp; hooliganism.\nAttendance and following.\nThe club has had a historically large and passionate following, with the club seeing attendance figures larger than other more fashionable clubs. For instance a 2019 by the International Centre for Sports Studies (&lt;a href=\"CIES\"&gt;CIES&lt;/a&gt;) showed that over the prior 5 seasons (2013 to 2018) Sunderland recorded the 38th highest average attendance in world football with an average of 39,249 fans at the &lt;a href=\"Stadium%20of%20Light\"&gt;Stadium of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Sunderland's average attendance were higher over that period than perennial title challengers such as &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in Italy and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;FC Porto&lt;/a&gt; in Portugal. Despite relegation from the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 the club has continued to post large annual average attendance figures, recording over 30,000 for the 2019 and 2020 seasons, enough for 16th in the country. Following relegation from &lt;a href=\"the%20Championship\"&gt;the Championship&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 2017-18 season, Sunderland subsequently broke the &lt;a href=\"League%20One\"&gt;League One&lt;/a&gt; division attendance record on 26 December 2018 in a match against &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt; with a total of 46,039 fans.\nPopular songs, music and chants.\nA song Sunderland fans sing every game and has been described as the anthem of the club is a rendition of \"&lt;a href=\"Can%27t%20Help%20Falling%20in%20Love\"&gt;Can't Help Falling in Love&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Elvis%20Presley\"&gt;Elvis Presley&lt;/a&gt;, with \"Sunderland\" being sung repeatedly after \"but I can't help falling in love with you.\" Also, during Gus Poyet's tenure, Sunderland supporters started singing \"\" by &lt;a href=\"D%20Ream\"&gt;D:Ream&lt;/a&gt;. The fans launched a campaign to get the song back into the charts, to coincide with their team's 2014 League Cup Final. A day after the Final, the song re-entered the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Dance%20Singles%20and%20Albums%20Charts\"&gt;UK Dance Chart&lt;/a&gt; at number 19.\nTwo of the most famous &lt;a href=\"Football%20chant\"&gt;chants&lt;/a&gt; by Sunderland supporters are \"I'm Sunderland till I die\" and \"We're by far the greatest team, the world has ever seen\" \u2014 with the former being chosen as the title of the Netflix show \"Sunderland 'Til I Die\". One of the oldest Sunderland chants is \"Ha'way the lads\" which was sung at Sunderland games as far back as the 1960s.\nAccording to a &lt;a href=\"YouGov\"&gt;YouGov&lt;/a&gt; poll in 2014, supporters of Sunderland showed a tendency towards &lt;a href=\"left-wing\"&gt;left&lt;/a&gt; politics. They sometimes sing a version of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Red%20Flag\"&gt;The Red Flag&lt;/a&gt;\" during games.\nFanzines and fan produced material.\nThe fans most enduring &lt;a href=\"fanzine\"&gt;fanzine&lt;/a&gt;s is \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Love%20Supreme%20%28Sunderland%29\"&gt;A Love Supreme&lt;/a&gt;\". The fanzine was first published in 1989 and has won several awards for best Fanzine. Since 2010 the online fanzine \"&lt;a href=\"Roker%20Report\"&gt;Roker Report&lt;/a&gt;\" has operated on the &lt;a href=\"SB%20Nation\"&gt;SB Nation&lt;/a&gt; blogging network.\nSupporters clubs and officially recognised organisations.\nAccording to the club there are over 70 branches of official Supporters' Clubs in England and around the world, including North Korea. The Official clubs are represented collectively by a Branch Liaison Council that was formed in the 1970s. In addition the club has had a SAFC Liaison Group (SLG) since 1994 that works with fans on club issues and an independent supporters group, the Red &amp; White Army (RAWA).\nRivalries and close ties.\nTyne-Wear derby.\nTraditionally, Sunderland's main rivals are Newcastle United with whom they contest the Tyne\u2013Wear derby.\nOther rivalries.\nThe club shared a rivalry with the now defunct &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20Albion\"&gt;Sunderland Albion&lt;/a&gt; in the 1880s and 1890s, a breakaway club formed by Sunderland's founder James Allan.\nIn recent seasons the club has also developed a minor rivalry with &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%20F.C.\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;, mainly stemming from the clubs meeting each other 5 times in the 2018\u201319 season.\nClose ties.\nConversely, sections of fans share a mutual friendship with Dutch club &lt;a href=\"Feyenoord\"&gt;Feyenoord&lt;/a&gt;; this was developed after Wearside shipbuilders found jobs in Rotterdam during the 1970s and 80s.\nThe club also has good relations with &lt;a href=\"Norwich%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Norwich City&lt;/a&gt;, matches between the two clubs being known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Friendship%20Trophy\"&gt;Friendship Trophy&lt;/a&gt;,\" following good rapport in the &lt;a href=\"1985%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1985 Milk Cup final&lt;/a&gt;.\nHooliganism.\nWhile early &lt;a href=\"Football%20hooliganism\"&gt;hooligan firms&lt;/a&gt; of Sunderland fans appeared as far back as the 1970s and the 1980s, like the Vauxies (named after the &lt;a href=\"Vaux%20Breweries\"&gt;Vaux Breweries&lt;/a&gt;), who were active in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the most famous hooligan firm is the &lt;a href=\"Seaburn%20Casuals\"&gt;Seaburn Casuals&lt;/a&gt;, named after the &lt;a href=\"Seaburn\"&gt;Seaburn&lt;/a&gt; area near &lt;a href=\"Roker%20Park\"&gt;Roker Park&lt;/a&gt; stadium.\nA few days before a game, in 1994, police snatched a pile of weapons and drugs worth thousands of pounds, and were preparing for a showdown with Nottingham hooligans.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1998 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, 26 Seaburn Casuals hooligans were arrested in a police raid after a military-issue smoke bomb was let out at a local pub after a fight with bouncers. By the end of the operation, over 60 were facing charges. Some of the Seaburn Casuals hooligans picked up in the raid were also involved with neo-Nazi groups like &lt;a href=\"Combat%2018\"&gt;Combat 18&lt;/a&gt;. The operation failed when a judge ruled CCTV footage from the pub inadmissible.\nAt the end of the 1999\u20132000 and the 2002\u201303 seasons, Sunderland topped the hooliganism table in the Premier League with 223 and 154 fan arrests, respectively.\nIn March 2002, the &lt;a href=\"Seaburn%20Casuals\"&gt;Seaburn Casuals&lt;/a&gt; fought with hooligans from the &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20Gremlins\"&gt;Newcastle Gremlins&lt;/a&gt; in a pre-arranged clash near the North &lt;a href=\"Shields%20Ferry\"&gt;Shields Ferry&lt;/a&gt; terminal, in what was described as \"some of the worst football related fighting ever witnessed in the United Kingdom\". The leaders of the Gremlins and Casuals were both jailed for four years for conspiracy, with 28 others jailed for various terms, based on evidence gained after police examined the messages sent by mobile phone between the gang members on the day.\nAccording to official data released by the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Spectators%20Act%201989\"&gt;Football Banning Order Authority&lt;/a&gt;, Sunderland's fanbase was named third most dangerous in English football in 2013\u201314, and in particular, a group called The Sunderland Youth Firm was noted in the context of its clashes with West Ham United fans.\nAffiliated clubs.\nSunderland have recently created affiliations with several African clubs including Ghana's &lt;a href=\"Asante%20Kotoko%20SC\"&gt;Asante Kotoko&lt;/a&gt;, Egypt's &lt;a href=\"El-Ittihad%20El-Iskandary\"&gt;El-Ittihad El-Iskandary&lt;/a&gt;, and South Africa's &lt;a href=\"Bidvest%20Wits%20F.C.\"&gt;Bidvest Wits&lt;/a&gt;. Sunderland also have an affiliation with Belgian side &lt;a href=\"Lierse%20S.K.\"&gt;Lierse S.K.&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the possibility for young African players who would not qualify for a UK work permit to spend three years with Lierse to gain a Belgian passport. In August 2014, Sunderland announced a commercial partnership with &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; based &lt;a href=\"MLS\"&gt;MLS&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"D.C.%20United\"&gt;D.C. United&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharitable associations.\nIn 2001, the chairman &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Murray%20%28businessman%29\"&gt;Bob Murray&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"Foundation%20of%20Light\"&gt;Foundation of Light&lt;/a&gt; charity, to help educational development through football, and offers learning centres in addition to scholarships. The organisation engaged 280 children within a year, and three years after foundation opened a \u00a31.6m facility along with &lt;a href=\"double-decker%20bus\"&gt;double-decker bus&lt;/a&gt;es redeveloped as classrooms.\nIn popular culture.\nSunderland were the subject, together with &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20FC\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;, of one of the earliest football paintings in the world \u2013 possibly the earliest \u2013 when in 1895 the artist Thomas M. M. Hemy painted a picture of a game between the teams at Sunderland's then ground &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20Road\"&gt;Newcastle Road&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1973, comedian &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Knoxall\"&gt;Bobby Knoxall&lt;/a&gt; recorded \"Sunderland All the Way\" for the &lt;a href=\"1973%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1973 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; record.\nIn 1996, a group of Sunderland fans under the name Simply Red and White released a song called \"Daydream Believer (Cheer Up Peter Reid)\" to the melody of \"&lt;a href=\"Daydream%20Believer\"&gt;Daydream Believer&lt;/a&gt;\" dedicated to the manager &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Reid\"&gt;Peter Reid&lt;/a&gt;. The song peaked at number 41 in the UK Singles &amp; Album Chart. The fans recorded the song due to the fact the manager often had a dour demeanour, whilst the team was doing well, and even won promotion at the end of the season.\nSunderland were mentioned in the May 1997 &lt;a href=\"State%20Opening%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;State Opening of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Mullin%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Chris Mullin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Sunderland South&lt;/a&gt;, stated in his seconding of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt;'s Gracious Speech:\nSunderland has been through hard times in the past, and has survived; as before, we will pick ourselves up, dust ourselves down and come out fighting. Sunderland looks to the future, not the past, and we shall soon be back in the Premier League.\nIn 1998 and following the demolition of Roker Park, playwright Tom Kelly and actor Paul Dunn created a one-man play called \"I Left My Heart at Roker Park\" about a fan struggling with the move and what Roker Park meant for him \u2013 the play originally ran in 1997, and has had a few revivals since.\nIn 1998, BBC broadcast a six-part documentary named &lt;a href=\"Premier%20Passions\"&gt;Premier Passions&lt;/a&gt;. It chronicled Sunderland A.F.C. during the &lt;a href=\"1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1996\u201397 season&lt;/a&gt;, in which the club was &lt;a href=\"Promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;relegated&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;, the year after winning &lt;a href=\"promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;promotion&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;Football League First Division&lt;/a&gt;, and the move to &lt;a href=\"Stadium%20of%20Light\"&gt;Stadium of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2018, Netflix released an eight-part documentary called &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20%27Til%20I%20Die\"&gt;Sunderland 'Til I Die&lt;/a&gt;. It documented the events around Sunderland A.F.C. during their &lt;a href=\"2017-18%20Sunderland%20A.F.C.%20season\"&gt;2017\u201318 season&lt;/a&gt; which saw them relegated from the &lt;a href=\"EFL%20Championship\"&gt;EFL Championship&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the success of the first series, a second season was confirmed, despite opposition from many club members. The opposition was mostly to do with players fearing the series would cause their failures being associated with them for the rest of their careers.\nNicknames.\nSunderland's official nickname is 'The Black Cats'. The name was made official in a public vote in 2000. Despite the nickname being made official only relatively recently, the black cat has been used as an emblem of the club throughout most of its history. Photographs exist of players holding a black cat which made Roker Park its home in the 1900s and 1910s, and which was fed and watered by the football club. The club's first official badge featured a black cat sitting prominently in its centre and since the 1960s the emblem of the Sunderland A.F.C. Supporters Association has been a black cat. A Sunderland supporter, Billy Morris, took a black cat in his chest pocket as a good luck charm to the 1937 FA Cup final in which Sunderland brought home the trophy for the first time and reference has also been made to a \"Black Cat Battery\", an &lt;a href=\"Artillery%20battery\"&gt;Artillery battery&lt;/a&gt; based on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Wear\"&gt;River Wear&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore this when the team still played at Roker Park, they were known as the Rokerites. This was made obsolete after the club left Roker Park for the Stadium of Light in 1997. Other nicknames used by the media and include the &lt;a href=\"Mackems\"&gt;Mackems&lt;/a&gt; (believed to be related to the ship building industry and a name for inhabitants of Sunderland) or the Wearsiders, as a reference to the river that the city and broader region of &lt;a href=\"Wearside\"&gt;Wearside&lt;/a&gt; sits alongside, and in contrast to their &lt;a href=\"Tyneside\"&gt;Tyneside&lt;/a&gt; rivals Newcastle United.\nAs well as club nicknames, names have been used to define memorable periods in the club's history. The \"Team of All Talents\" moniker was used during Sunderland's successful period in the 1890s, and Sunderland were known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20England%20club\"&gt;Bank of England club&lt;/a&gt;\" during the 1950s. This was in reference to the club's spending in the &lt;a href=\"transfer%20market\"&gt;transfer market&lt;/a&gt; at the time, which saw the transfer-record broken twice.\nStatistics and records.\nThe holder of the record for the most league appearances is &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Montgomery\"&gt;Jimmy Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;, having made 527\u00a0first team appearances between 1961 and 1976. The club's top league goal scorer is &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Buchan\"&gt;Charlie Buchan&lt;/a&gt;, who scored 209\u00a0goals from 1911 to 1925; &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Gurney\"&gt;Bobby Gurney&lt;/a&gt; is the record goalscorer over all competitions with 228\u00a0goals between 1926\u00a0and\u00a01939. &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Halliday\"&gt;Dave Halliday&lt;/a&gt; holds the record for the most goals scored in a season: 43\u00a0in the &lt;a href=\"1928%E2%80%9329%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1928\u201329 season&lt;/a&gt; in the Football League First Division. As of October 2014 &lt;a href=\"John%20O%27Shea\"&gt;John O'Shea&lt;/a&gt; is the most capped player for the club, making 100\u00a0appearances for the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe club's widest victory margin in the league was in the 9\u20131 win against Newcastle United in the First Division in 1908. Sunderland's biggest ever win in the FA cup was against Fair field (a non-league team) and the final score was 11\u20131. Their heaviest defeats in the league were 8\u20130 against &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in 1911, &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt; in 1968, &lt;a href=\"Watford%20F.C.\"&gt;Watford&lt;/a&gt; in 1982 and &lt;a href=\"Southampton%20F.C.\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 Sunderland joined the top division in England, &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20League\"&gt;The Football League&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"1890%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1890\u201391 season&lt;/a&gt; and were not relegated until &lt;a href=\"1957%E2%80%9358%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1957\u201358&lt;/a&gt; (a span of 67\u00a0seasons). In October 2015, Sunderland defeated rivals Newcastle United for the sixth consecutive time, a new record.\nSunderland's record home attendance is 75,200 for a sixth round replay FA Cup match against Derby County on 8 March 1933.\nRecord goalscorers.\n10 Sunderland players have scored 100 goals or more in league competitions. They are as follows:\nBobby Gurney holds the record number of goals in all competitions with a combined total of 228 in league and cup games.\nTransfers.\nThe biggest transfer fee Sunderland have ever received for one of their players is \u00a330 million for &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Pickford\"&gt;Jordan Pickford&lt;/a&gt;, who moved to &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; in July 2017. This was also the biggest fee Sunderland have received for a player produced by the Sunderland academy. The biggest transfer fee paid by Sunderland is \u00a313.6 million for &lt;a href=\"Didier%20Ndong\"&gt;Didier Ndong&lt;/a&gt;, who was bought from &lt;a href=\"FC%20Lorient\"&gt;Lorient&lt;/a&gt; in August 2016.\nOverall.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"2021%E2%80%9322%20Sunderland%20A.F.C.%20season\"&gt;2021\u201322 season&lt;/a&gt;\nKit sponsorship.\nThe first sponsor to appear on Sunderland kits was Cowie's, the business group of then chairman &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Cowie\"&gt;Tom Cowie&lt;/a&gt;, between 1983 and 1985. The club was sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Vaux%20Breweries\"&gt;Vaux Breweries&lt;/a&gt; between 1985 and 1999, with drink brands such as Lambtons sometimes appearing on kits. Subsequently, the club were sponsored by Sunderland car dealership company Reg Vardy from 1999 to 2007. Sunderland were sponsored by the Irish bookmaker &lt;a href=\"Boylesports\"&gt;Boylesports&lt;/a&gt;, who signed a four-year contract with the club in 2007 estimated to be worth \u00a38\u00a0million. In April 2010, Sunderland signed a two-year shirt sponsorship deal with &lt;a href=\"Tombola%20%28bingo%20company%29\"&gt;tombola&lt;/a&gt;, a local online bingo company. On 25 June 2012, Sunderland announced the strengthening of their partnership with the Invest in Africa initiative, with the initiative becoming the club's shirt sponsor for two years.
