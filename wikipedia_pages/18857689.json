In 1924 along with two other notable Amatieris footballers \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Ark%C4%81dijs%20Pavlovs\"&gt;Ark\u0101dijs Pavlovs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arnolds%20Tauri%C5%86%C5%A1\"&gt;Arnolds Tauri\u0146\u0161&lt;/a&gt; \u0100brams joined &lt;a href=\"R%C4%ABgas%20FK\"&gt;RFK&lt;/a&gt; as it went on to its first Latvian league title. \u0100brams went on to winning two more league titles with RFK in 1925 and 1926. At the end of the 1927 season \u0100brams was one of several RFK main squad footballers (together with &lt;a href=\"Arv%C4%ABds%20Jurgens\"&gt;Arv\u012bds Jurgens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voldem%C4%81rs%20Plade\"&gt;Voldem\u0101rs Plade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C4%8Ceslavs%20Stan%C4%8Diks\"&gt;\u010ceslavs Stan\u010diks&lt;/a&gt; and others) to leave the team for the newly founded &lt;a href=\"Riga%20Vanderer\"&gt;Riga Vanderer&lt;/a&gt; club which became a strong rival for RFK in the following years (RFK was usually the stronger side on field, but there was always a high tension surrounding the derby between these two sides). In 1928 RV with \u0100brams as one its key players won the &lt;a href=\"Riga\"&gt;Riga&lt;/a&gt; Class B tournament to progress to Class A which it won the following year.\nIn 1930 \u0100brams returned together with Vanderer to the top tier of Latvian football, winning the bronze medals of Virsl\u012bga. He retired from top-level football in 1931. In later years \u0100brams played in football tournaments for clerks as a member of the squad of the Latvian &lt;a href=\"customs\"&gt;customs&lt;/a&gt; office.\nNational team playing career.\n\u0100brams played 8 international matches for &lt;a href=\"Latvia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Latvia national football team&lt;/a&gt; in the period from 1924 to 1927, scoring two goals \u2013 in friendly matches against &lt;a href=\"Estonia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lithuania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; in 1924. He played for Latvia for the last time on 29 May 1927 as Latvia suffered a devastating 0\u201312 loss against &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;."
