    "text": "The 1925 Chatham Cup was the third annual nationwide knockout &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; competition in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe competition was run on a regional basis. Each region held its own contest to find a regional champion, with these then being grouped into four regional associations (Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury, and Otago), each of which was represented in semi-finals by one team, followed by northern and southern semi-finals and a national final.\nEntrants.\nIn all, 30 teams took part in the competition, though some contemporary reports say there were 29. Ten of these teams were from the Wellington area, nine from Auckland, and three from Christchurch.Confusion is caused by some contemporary reports which list the Pukemiro team as \"Huntly\", despite these being two separate sides from the same area.\nThe 1925 final.\nThe final was played at &lt;a href=\"Newtown%20Park\"&gt;Newtown Park&lt;/a&gt;, Wellington, a change of venue from the previous finals which had been at &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Park%20%28Wellington%29\"&gt;Athletic Park&lt;/a&gt;. This new venue was to host the final again in 1927, with the &lt;a href=\"Basin%20Reserve\"&gt;Basin Reserve&lt;/a&gt; being preferred as a permanent venue from 1928 after its use in 1926. The 1925 final was part of an unusual double-bill, the ground also being used on the same day for a rugby league match between the New Zealand team and a touring Queensland representative XIII.\nThe final was the first re-match of two teams who had previously contested a final; six Seacliff players and four YWCA players played in both the 1923 and 1925 finals. The game was described in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dominion%20%28Wellington%29\"&gt;The Dominion&lt;/a&gt;\" as entertaining with a number of chances, as was reflected by the scoreline, which was 2-2 at full time. The first goal came from Stewart Dempster for YMCA, but Wattie Hanlin equalised before the half-time interval. In the second half Seacliff went into the lead through &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Hooper%20%28New%20Zealand%20footballer%29\"&gt;Bill Hooper&lt;/a&gt;, who became the first player to score in two separate finals, having previously scored in Seacliff's 1923 win. this time it was YMCA who equalised with a second goal from Dempster. Dave Halley grabbed the winner for the Wellington side early in the first period of extra time.\nResults.\nFourth Round.\nSee note below quarter-finals.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe fourth quarter-final would have been between &lt;a href=\"Nomads%20United\"&gt;Nomads&lt;/a&gt; and either &lt;a href=\"Christchurch%20Rangers\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sunnyside%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;Sunnyside&lt;/a&gt;. Two of these three teams would have previously met in the fourth round."
