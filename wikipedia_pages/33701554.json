    "text": "\u00c5rhus Stiftstidende (colloquially Stiften) is a &lt;a href=\"Danish%20language\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; newspaper based in &lt;a href=\"Aarhus\"&gt;Aarhus&lt;/a&gt;, Denmark, focusing largely on local topics.\nHistory and profile.\nFirst published by Niels Lund on 3 January 1794, \"\u00c5rhus Stiftstidende\" is among the oldest businesses in Denmark still in operation. It originated as part of the \"Stiftstidende\" dailies; with two other \"Stiftstidende\" newspapers published in &lt;a href=\"Aalborg\"&gt;Aalborg&lt;/a&gt; - \"&lt;a href=\"Aalborg%20Stiftstidende\"&gt;Aalborg Stiftstidende&lt;/a&gt;\" founded in 1767 -, and &lt;a href=\"Odense\"&gt;Odense&lt;/a&gt; - \"&lt;a href=\"Fyens%20Stiftstidende\"&gt;Fyens Stiftstidende&lt;/a&gt;\" started in 1772. Until 1927, the publishing company of \"Aarhuus Stiftsbogtrykkerie\" owned and published the paper. Between 1918 and 1952, Louis Schmidt served as the &lt;a href=\"editor-in-chief\"&gt;editor-in-chief&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"\u00c5rhus Stifstidende\" serves for &lt;a href=\"Jutland%20Peninsula\"&gt;Jutland&lt;/a&gt;. The paper has no official political affiliation, but has a &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20in%20Denmark\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; political leaning. It is published in broadsheet format. On 1 January 2007, \"\u00c5rhus Stifstidende\" merged with other local newspapers in &lt;a href=\"Midtjylland\"&gt;Midtjylland&lt;/a&gt; to form the editorial company of Midtjyske Medier, a branch of &lt;a href=\"Berlingske%20Media\"&gt;Berlingske Media&lt;/a&gt;. In late 2015, Midtjyske Medier was sold and fused with &lt;a href=\"Jysk%20Fynske%20Medier\"&gt;Jysk Fynske Medier&lt;/a&gt;, the second largest mediagroup in Denmark by turnover.\n\"\u00c5rhus Stiftstidende\" used to publish the &lt;a href=\"free%20newspaper\"&gt;free local weekly newspaper&lt;/a&gt; \"Aarhus Onsdag\" (Aarhus Wednesday) and the cityguide website \"AOA, Alt Om Aarhus\" (All About Aarhus). The \"Aarhus Onsdag\" paper is more limited in its scope, is financed completely by advertisements and is available both in paperform and online, but was sold to competitor &lt;a href=\"JP/Politikens%20Hus\"&gt;JP/Politikens Hus&lt;/a&gt; in June 2017. The AOA website was also free and included a number of free online magazines covering fashion, culture, tourist guiding, studentlife etc., but was terminated in 2016 after the sale of Midtjyske Medier.\nCirculation.\n\"\u00c5rhus Stiftstidende\" had a circulation of 71,000 copies on weekdays and 83,000 copies on Sundays in the first quarter of 2000, making it one of the top 20 newspapers in the country. The circulation of the paper was 59,000 copies in 2002. The paper had a circulation of 55,000 copies in 2003. The paper sold 51,500 copies in 2005.\nDuring the first half of 2009 the circulation of \"\u00c5rhus Stiftstidende\" was 24,231 copies. It fell to 22,168 copies during the first six months of 2010 and to 20,329 copies during the first six months of 2011."
