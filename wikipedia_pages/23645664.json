    "text": "Manglerud Star Ishockey, commonly known as &lt;a href=\"Manglerud%20Star\"&gt;Manglerud Star&lt;/a&gt; and abbreviated as MS, is a &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; team based in &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. They currently play in the &lt;a href=\"GET-ligaen\"&gt;GET-ligaen&lt;/a&gt;, after replacing the bankrupt &lt;a href=\"Rosenborg%20IHK\"&gt;Rosenborg IHK&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 2014.\nManglerud Star was founded in 1967 and was promoted to the top division in 1973. The club enjoyed a spell of success in the late 1970s, winning two national championships, to date the club's only trophies. In modern times, the club is still widely regarded to have one of the best youth academies in Norwegian hockey. Manglerud play their home games at &lt;a href=\"Manglerudhallen\"&gt;Manglerudhallen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe multi-sports club &lt;a href=\"IL%20Manglerud%20Star\"&gt;SK Star&lt;/a&gt; was founded on 23 June 1913 at &lt;a href=\"Akershus%20Festning\"&gt;Akershus Festning&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;. In 1964, the club merged with \"Manglerud IL\", to form \"Manglerud Star IL\". The ice hockey division became active three years later. The first, and to date only, titles would come in the late 70s, with the club winning the national championships in 1977 and 1978. The 90s would be an unstable decade for Manglerud, with the club unsuccessfully attempting mergers with other Oslo-based clubs, most notably with &lt;a href=\"Furuset%20Ishockey\"&gt;Furuset&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href=\"Spektrum%20Flyers\"&gt;Spektrum Flyers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 2004/05 season, Manglerud Star was relegated from the top flight due to financial problems. After spending four season on the second tier, Manglerud finally qualified for &lt;a href=\"GET-ligaen\"&gt;GET-ligaen&lt;/a&gt; again for the 2009/10 season. The club was relegated again following the 2011/12 season, but regained the top flight spot following &lt;a href=\"Rosenborg%20IHK\"&gt;Rosenborg IHK&lt;/a&gt;s bankruptcy in the summer of 2014.\nManglerud has delivered more players to professional ice hockey leagues around the world than any other hockey team in Norway. In 2004, the city of Oslo provided funding for a renovation of &lt;a href=\"Manglerudhallen\"&gt;Manglerudhallen&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes a &lt;a href=\"soccer\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; arena beside the hockey rink.\nSeason-by-season results.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by Manglerud Star. For the full season-by-season history, see &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Manglerud%20Star%20Ishockey%20seasons\"&gt;List of Manglerud Star Ishockey seasons&lt;/a&gt;.\""
