    "text": "Monsieur N. is a 2003 British-French film directed by &lt;a href=\"Antoine%20de%20Caunes\"&gt;Antoine de Caunes&lt;/a&gt;. It tells the story of the last years of the life of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20of%20the%20French\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Napol%C3%A9on\"&gt;Napol\u00e9on&lt;/a&gt; (played by &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20Torreton\"&gt;Philippe Torreton&lt;/a&gt;), who was imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"St%20Helena\"&gt;St Helena&lt;/a&gt;. Napol\u00e9on retained a loyal entourage of officers who helped him plot his escape, and evaded the attentions of &lt;a href=\"Major%20General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Major-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Hudson%20Lowe\"&gt;Sir Hudson Lowe&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Richard%20E.%20Grant\"&gt;Richard E. Grant&lt;/a&gt;), the island's overzealous &lt;a href=\"Governor\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe film suggests that Napol\u00e9on could have escaped to &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, where he died, and that the body exhumed and now at &lt;a href=\"Les%20Invalides\"&gt;Les Invalides&lt;/a&gt; is that of Napol\u00e9on's officer Cipriani. The film also suggests that Napol\u00e9on and his young new English wife could have attended the ceremony of \"Napol\u00e9on's\" burial in the Invalides.\nReception.\nThe film was well received. , 71% of the 21 reviews compiled by &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Tomatoes\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; are positive, with an average rating of 6.27/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Fueled by performances as polished as its visuals, \"Monsieur N.\" is a flawed yet largely absorbing look at an imagined chapter of Napoleon's exile.\"\nThe film received a positive but guarded review in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\", which praised Philippe Torreton's performance but thought the narrative too complex for an audience not initiated in Napol\u00e9on's history."
