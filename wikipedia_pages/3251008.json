    "text": "The Khaksar movement () was a &lt;a href=\"social%20movement\"&gt;social movement&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Lahore\"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Punjab%20Province%20%28British%20India%29\"&gt;Punjab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"British%20India\"&gt;British India&lt;/a&gt;, established by &lt;a href=\"Allama%20Mashriqi\"&gt;Allama Mashriqi&lt;/a&gt; in 1931, with the aim of freeing India from the rule of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt; and establish a &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20state\"&gt;Muslim government&lt;/a&gt; in India, uniting both Hindus and Muslims. The membership of the Khaksar movement was open to everyone and had no membership fee regardless of the person's religion, race and caste or social status. The emphasis was on the brotherhood of mankind and being inclusive for all people.\nHistory.\nAround 1930, Allama Mashriqi, a charismatic Muslim intellectual whom some considered to be of anarchist persuasion, revisited the principles for self-reform and self-conduct that he had laid out in his 1924 &lt;a href=\"treatise\"&gt;treatise&lt;/a&gt;, entitled \"Tazkira\". He incorporated them into a second treatise, \"Isharat\", and this served as the foundation for the Khaksar movement, which Roy Jackson has described as being \"...\u00a0essentially to free India from colonial rule and to revive Islam, although it also aimed to give justice and equal rights to all faiths.\" They took their name from the Persian words \"khak\" and \"sar\", respectively meaning \"dust\" and \"like\" and roughly combined to translate as a \"humble person\".\nAdopting the language of revolution, Mashriqi began recruiting followers to his cause in his village of &lt;a href=\"Ichhra\"&gt;Ichhra&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Lahore\"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt;. An early report said that the movement began with 90 followers. It quickly expanded, adding 300 young members within a few weeks. By 1942 it was reported that the membership was four million and Jackson remarks that it was \"phenomenal in its success.\" There was also an associated weekly newspaper called \"&lt;a href=\"Al-Islah%20%28Khaksar%20Tehrik%20weekly%29\"&gt;Al-Islah&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOn 4 October 1939, after the commencement of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20world%20war\"&gt;Second world war&lt;/a&gt;, Mashriqui, who was then in &lt;a href=\"Lucknow\"&gt;Lucknow&lt;/a&gt; jail, offered to increase the size of the organisation to help with the war effort. He offered a force of 30,000 well-drilled soldiers for the internal defence of &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, 10,000 for the &lt;a href=\"Police\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;, and 10,000 to provide help for &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; or to fight on European soil. His offer was not accepted.\nOn 19 March, 1940 just 3 days before All India Muslim Leagues most momentous meeting, at least 32 or as much as 300 Khaksars, including their Pivotal Leader Agha Zaigham were mercilessly killed by the Punjab Police under the command of the SP Mr. D. Gainsford in Lahore. Because of which then Premier of Punjab sir Sikandar Consulted Jinnah for postponement of Muslim League session which Jinnah denied. &lt;ref name=\"M. M. Shafi\"&gt;"
