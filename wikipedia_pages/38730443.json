It is primarily used for &lt;a href=\"cooking%20apple\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fruit has green skin, which turns yellow when ripened, developing flecks of red and grey &lt;a href=\"russet%20apple\"&gt;russet&lt;/a&gt;. It is harvested from late October, primarily in &lt;a href=\"South-East%20England\"&gt;South-East England&lt;/a&gt;. It has a sharp, sweet taste, resulting in its mostly being recommended for cooking meals and &lt;a href=\"dessert\"&gt;dessert&lt;/a&gt;s.
