    "text": "George Henry Bennett (18508 September 1908) was a brewer and a politician.\nBennett was born in &lt;a href=\"Buckie\"&gt;Buckie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banffshire\"&gt;Banffshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. His family emigrated to Australia in 1855.\nHe managed the Victoria Sugar Co. and later, with a partner, owned Excelsior Brewery, a porterbrewing business. Excelsior Brewery operated in &lt;a href=\"Collingwood%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Collingwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt;. As larger brewers took over the local market, Excelsior moved to manufacturing aerated waters and cordials at &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt;. He took over sole control of the company from August 1883.\nIn 1880 Bennett was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt; town council and, in turn, was elected &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Chairmen%20and%20Mayors%20of%20Richmond\"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt; in 1886. As &lt;a href=\"Mayor\"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt; he was also elected as the second President of the fledgling &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Richmond Football Club&lt;/a&gt;, commencing with the 1887 season. He held this post for the next twenty-two years until his death. During his tenure the club won its first two &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Victorian Football Association&lt;/a&gt; premierships and gained admittance to the more powerful &lt;a href=\"VFL/AFL\"&gt;Victorian Football League&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protectionism\"&gt;protectionist&lt;/a&gt;, he was elected to the seat of Richmond in the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Victorian Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in 1889 and was then re-elected at the next seven elections.\nBennett died of &lt;a href=\"pneumonia\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; at his home in &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Richmond, Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, on 8 September 1908. He was survived by his wife, Jessie, and two of their three daughters.\nHis bust stands outside the &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Richmond Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;."
