In the same year he won two International Breakbeat Awards Awards (aka Breakspoll Awards), one for Best Producer and one for Best Label (for his highly regarded U&amp;A imprint). Prior to this he ran the Fused &amp; Bruised imprint between 1996\u20132002, and is often cited as one of the leading proponents of the emergent Tech-Funk movement, fusing &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"breakbeat\"&gt;breakbeat&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; &lt;a href=\"Electro%20%28music%29\"&gt;electro&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile a student at &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20University\"&gt;Exeter University&lt;/a&gt; he started his first band, &lt;a href=\"Headless%20Chickens%20%28UK%20band%29\"&gt;Headless Chickens&lt;/a&gt; with future &lt;a href=\"Radiohead\"&gt;Radiohead&lt;/a&gt; vocalist &lt;a href=\"Thom%20Yorke\"&gt;Thom Yorke&lt;/a&gt; whom he went on to form a band called Flicker Noise who signed to &lt;a href=\"Concrete\"&gt;Concrete&lt;/a&gt; Records, an offshoot of &lt;a href=\"Deconstruction\"&gt;Deconstruction&lt;/a&gt;. He was then one half of the English duo &lt;a href=\"Lunatic%20Calm\"&gt;Lunatic Calm&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he released two albums, namely &lt;a href=\"Metropol%20%28album%29\"&gt;Metropol&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 and &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20Point%20%28Lunatic%20Calm%20album%29\"&gt;Breaking Point&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. Some of his songs (both remixes and new tracks) have appeared on &lt;a href=\"The%20Crystal%20Method\"&gt;The Crystal Method&lt;/a&gt; remix albums, \"&lt;a href=\"Community%20Service%20%28album%29\"&gt;Community Service&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Community%20Service%20II\"&gt;Community Service II&lt;/a&gt;\" amongst others .\nDespite attempting to keep his identity a secret, Simon also became well known as the Electro producer Zodiac Cartel between 2007 and 2012, and prior to that had recorded under multiple shorter-lived aliases such as Killer Elite, Futurecore, Double Black, pHrack R and Synchromesh. In 2014 he is increasingly renowned and respected for his outstanding, and often heroically long, House &amp; Techno DJ sets. He also manages the Stereophoenix label, which describes its ethos as \"Electronic Music with Heart &amp; Soul\"."
