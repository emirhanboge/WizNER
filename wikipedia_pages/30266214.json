    "text": "Leon (, \"lion\"), also known colloquially as Nisi (\"the island\") and during &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Venice\"&gt;Venetian&lt;/a&gt; rule as Rabbit Island, is an islet in &lt;a href=\"Souda%20Bay\"&gt;Souda Bay&lt;/a&gt; on the northwest coast of &lt;a href=\"Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the southeast side of the islet, a small distance away, there is another larger islet called &lt;a href=\"Souda%20%28island%29\"&gt;Souda&lt;/a&gt;. In ancient times these two islets were referred to as Leukai (Greek for \"white ones\") and pronounced \"Lefkai\". Their name came from the ancient Greek myth about a musical contest between the &lt;a href=\"Siren%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Siren&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Muses\"&gt;Muses&lt;/a&gt;. Out of their anguish from losing the competition, writes &lt;a href=\"Stephanus%20of%20Byzantium\"&gt;Stephanus of Byzantium&lt;/a&gt;, the Muses plucked their rivals' feathers from their wings; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at &lt;a href=\"Aptera%2C%20Greece\"&gt;Aptera&lt;/a&gt; (\"featherless\") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai."
