In fall of 2006 The Jolie-Pitt Foundation recognized GAC\u2019s work with a $1M grant and &lt;a href=\"Angelina%20Jolie\"&gt;Angelina Jolie&lt;/a&gt; served as Honorary Board Chair. GAC was supported by The Jolie-Pitt Foundation, The &lt;a href=\"Bill%20%26amp%3B%20Melinda%20Gates%20Foundation\"&gt;Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, FB International and other &lt;a href=\"Donor\"&gt;donors&lt;/a&gt;. \nGAC Leadership Council Included: &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; Faith and Justice Network, &lt;a href=\"American%20Jewish%20World%20Service\"&gt;American Jewish World Service&lt;/a&gt;, Center for Health and &lt;a href=\"Gender%20equality\"&gt;Gender Equity&lt;/a&gt;, The Children's Project, &lt;a href=\"Church%20Women%20United\"&gt;Church Women United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Church%20World%20Service\"&gt;Church World Service&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Episcopal Church USA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lutheran%20Church%20in%20America\"&gt;Lutheran Church of America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FXB%20International\"&gt;FXB International&lt;/a&gt;, Global &lt;a href=\"HIV/AIDS\"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Global%20Justice%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Global Justice&lt;/a&gt;, Hope for African Children Initiative, &lt;a href=\"Keep%20a%20Child%20Alive\"&gt;Keep a Child Alive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mother\"&gt;Mothers&lt;/a&gt; Acting Up, &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20National%20Baptist%20Convention\"&gt;Progressive National Baptist Convention&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Religion\"&gt;Religious&lt;/a&gt; Action Center of &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Judaism\"&gt;Reformed Judaism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Results%20%28organisation%29\"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/a&gt;, Save Africa's Children, &lt;a href=\"Student%20Global%20AIDS%20Campaign\"&gt;Student Global AIDS Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Student\"&gt;Student&lt;/a&gt; Campaign fort Child Survival, &lt;a href=\"United%20Methodist%20Church\"&gt;United Methodist Church&lt;/a&gt; General Board of Church and Society\nGAC's unique strength was derived from the effectiveness and diversity of the charitable, faith-based, nongovernmental, and student organizations that comprise its Leadership Council, and the ability to mobilize a broad range of constituencies.\nGAC was a nonpartisan, independent voice for children that did not accept any U.S. &lt;a href=\"Public%20finance\"&gt;government funding&lt;/a&gt;. That independence allowed GAC to adhere to its mission, avoid advocating out of self-interest, and take bold action on issues affecting children without fear of financial repercussions. Many in the child health community looked to GAC to be a strong, independent voice.\nGAC areas of focus: securing support of the international community for children who had lost one or more parents or were made vulnerable due to AIDS, &lt;a href=\"Tuberculosis\"&gt;TB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malaria\"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt;, conflict, or &lt;a href=\"natural%20disaster\"&gt;natural disaster&lt;/a&gt;. Additional areas of focus were universal basic education, keeping children with family and community (community care), &lt;a href=\"Developmental%20psychology\"&gt;early childhood development&lt;/a&gt;, child survival and &lt;a href=\"Immunization\"&gt;immunizations&lt;/a&gt;, supporting children in conflict, gender equity, and prevention of &lt;a href=\"child%20marriage\"&gt;child marriage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"child%20sexual%20abuse\"&gt;child sexual abuse&lt;/a&gt;.\nJennifer Delaney led GAC from September 2004 - October 2009. Kathleen Guy served as Executive Director from October 2009 \u2013 2010.\nWhile Global Action for Children ceased operations in December 2010, GAC's work on behalf of OVC continues to impact the lives of millions of children around the globe. GAC's leadership in securing a 10% of \"The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)\" for OVCs and the passage \"The Assistance for Orphans and Vulnerable Children Act of 2005\" leaves a legacy of billions of dollars in US Foreign Assistance for vulnerable children and their families in developing countries, and a framework on how the funding should be spent to most effectively serve that population. First authorized in 2003, the program has been reauthorized three times: in 2008, 2013, and most recently in December 2018. PEPFAR has provided care for more than 6.3 million orphans and vulnerable children (OVC).\nAdvocacy Strategy\nTimeline\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\nExternal links\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//people.com/celebrity/angelina-jolie-calls-for-more-funding-for-orphans/\"&gt;Angelina Jolie calls for more Funding for Orphans&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//issuu.com/g_a_c/docs/gac_annualreport2008_eversion\"&gt;GAC Annual Report 2008&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.today.com/popculture/angelina-jolie-commits-world-s-children-wbna18425828\"&gt;GAC Launch, Washington Press Club&lt;/a&gt;"
