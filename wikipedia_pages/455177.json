    "title": "Anabatic wind",
    "text": "An anabatic wind, from the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aanabasis\"&gt;anabatos&lt;/a&gt;\", verbal of \"anabainein\" meaning moving upward, is a warm wind which blows up a steep slope or &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; side, driven by heating of the slope through &lt;a href=\"insolation\"&gt;insolation&lt;/a&gt;. It is also known as an upslope flow. These winds typically occur during the daytime in calm sunny weather. A &lt;a href=\"hill\"&gt;hill&lt;/a&gt; or mountain top will be &lt;a href=\"heat%20transfer\"&gt;radiatively&lt;/a&gt; warmed by the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; which in turn &lt;a href=\"heat\"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt;s the &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; just above it. Air at a similar &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt; over an adjacent &lt;a href=\"valley\"&gt;valley&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"plain\"&gt;plain&lt;/a&gt; does not get warmed so much because of the greater distance to the ground below it. The effect may be enhanced if the lower lying ground is shaded by the mountain and so receives less heat\nThe air over the hill top is now warmer than the air at a similar altitude around it and will rise through &lt;a href=\"convection\"&gt;convection&lt;/a&gt;. This creates a lower pressure region into which the air at the bottom of the slope flows, causing the wind. It is common for the air rising from the tops of large mountains to reach a height where it cools &lt;a href=\"adiabatic%20process\"&gt;adiabatically&lt;/a&gt; to below its &lt;a href=\"dew%20point\"&gt;dew point&lt;/a&gt; and forms &lt;a href=\"cumulus%20cloud\"&gt;cumulus cloud&lt;/a&gt;s. These can then produce &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAnabatic winds are particularly useful to soaring &lt;a href=\"Glider%20%28sailplane%29\"&gt;glider&lt;/a&gt; pilots who can use them to increase the aircraft's altitude. Anabatic winds can be detrimental to the maximum downhill speed of cyclists.\nConversely, &lt;a href=\"katabatic%20wind\"&gt;katabatic wind&lt;/a&gt;s are down-slope winds, frequently produced at night by the opposite effect, the air near to the ground losing heat to it faster than air at a similar altitude over adjacent low-lying land.\n&lt;a href=\"Monsoon\"&gt;Monsoon&lt;/a&gt; winds are similarly generated, but on a continental scale and seasonal cycle."
