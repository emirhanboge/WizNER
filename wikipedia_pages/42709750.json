    "text": "Jacqueline Keeler is a &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; writer and activist, enrolled in the &lt;a href=\"Navajo%20Nation\"&gt;Navajo Nation&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=\"Yankton%20Dakota\"&gt;Yankton Dakota&lt;/a&gt; descent, who co-founded Eradicating Offensive Native Mascotry (EONM), which seeks to &lt;a href=\"Native%20American%20mascot%20controversy\"&gt;end the use of Native American racial groups as mascots&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education.\nKeeler was born in &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, to parents who had been moved there as part of the &lt;a href=\"Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs\"&gt;Bureau of Indian Affairs&lt;/a&gt; Indian relocation programs of the 1950s and 1960s; currently residing in Portland, Oregon. She is also a graduate of &lt;a href=\"Dartmouth%20College\"&gt;Dartmouth College&lt;/a&gt; and has written about recent events there regarding the Native American Program.\nShe is Kinyaa'\u00e1anii (Towering House clan) and a citizen of the &lt;a href=\"Navajo%20Nation\"&gt;Navajo Nation&lt;/a&gt;. Her mother's family is from Cameron, Arizona, and she is a descendant of Gus Big Horse through her grandmother Jean Big Horse Canyon, a rug weaver. Her grandparents were traditional Din\u00e9 who did not speak English and ran a ranch near the south rim of the Grand Canyon. Her father was a citizen of the &lt;a href=\"Yankton%20Sioux%20Tribe\"&gt;Yankton Sioux Tribe&lt;/a&gt; from Lake Andes, South Dakota.\nHer grandmother Marjorie Keeler was from a prominent Episcopalian Dakota family. She was the first cousin of Standing Rock Lakota historian &lt;a href=\"Vine%20Deloria%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Vine Deloria, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, niece of Yankton Dakota ethnologist and linguist &lt;a href=\"Ella%20Deloria\"&gt;Ella Deloria&lt;/a&gt;, and niece of the Rev. Vine Deloria, Sr. She was also the niece of the Rev. Charles Cook. Cook, the Yankton Dakota minister at &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Ridge%20Reservation\"&gt;Pine Ridge&lt;/a&gt; who, with fellow Dakota &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Eastman\"&gt;Dr. Charles Eastman&lt;/a&gt;, oversaw the welfare of Lakota survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Wounded%20Knee%20Massacre\"&gt;Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890&lt;/a&gt;. Marjorie Keeler was also the great-niece of Rosebud Lakota author Susan Bordeaux Bettelyoun.\nCareer and activism.\nKeeler's articles have been widely quoted and published. Much of her writing has coincided with her activism.\nKeeler co-founded Eradicating Offensive Native Mascotry, which launched and trended the hashtag #NotYourMascot during the 2014 Super Bowl. EONM seeks to &lt;a href=\"Native%20American%20mascot%20controversy\"&gt;end the use of racial groups as mascots&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other stereotypical representations in popular culture, and &lt;a href=\"cultural%20appropriation\"&gt;cultural appropriation&lt;/a&gt;. Keeler wrote \"'Native Mascotry' is a term I coined to describe the practices that surround a Native mascot. It\u2019s not just about the static image of the mascot, be it somewhat noble and prosaic or an ugly caricature with a feather on top. It\u2019s the creative license such mascots gives fans to reenact outdated stereotypes, to 'play Indian.' These practices include: the wearing of Redface, the misuse of Native regalia and the chanting of fake, hokey war chants and tomahawk chops.\" Keeler has been interviewed by various media outlets about the topics of racial stereotypes.\nHer activism also extends to issues of abortion, traditional native values and Indigenous rights, and issues of &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20sovereignty\"&gt;Indigenous sovereignty&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe has published the Alleged &lt;a href=\"Pretendians\"&gt;Pretendians&lt;/a&gt; List, primarily made up of individuals in academia and entertainment who are monetizing their claims to Native American or First Nations identity but who, Keeler writes, research and documentation demonstrates have no Native heritage or community ties.\nAuthor.\nKeeler is the author of \"Standoff: Standing Rock, the Bundy Movement, and the American Story of Sacred Lands\". Praised by Ojibway author &lt;a href=\"Louise%20Erdrich\"&gt;Louise Erdrich&lt;/a&gt;: \"Rigorous analysis and personal storytelling invigorate Jacqueline Keeler's examination of Indigenous vs. colonial land tenure. \"Standoff\" recounts the historic legacy of treaty rights and sacred space underpinning Standing Rock's case against the &lt;a href=\"Dakota%20Access%20Pipeline\"&gt;Dakota Access Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, and contrasts this legacy with the white entitlement as well as cultural land desecrations of the Bundy movement. Standoff is a powerful, illuminating book.\"\nIn 2017, she also edited \"Edge of Morning: Native Voices Speak for the Bears Ears\" featuring fifteen contributors: multi-generational writers, poets, activists, teachers, students, and public officials examining tribal efforts to protect the &lt;a href=\"Bears%20Ears%20National%20Monument\"&gt;Bears Ears&lt;/a&gt; by making it a national monument."
