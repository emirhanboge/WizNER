    "title": "Mediterranean pass",
    "text": "The Mediterranean pass (or Mediterranean passport, the name used in the United States) was a document which identified a ship as being protected under a treaty with states of the &lt;a href=\"Barbary%20Coast\"&gt;Barbary Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Such a treaty exacted tribute in exchange for protection from &lt;a href=\"Barbary%20pirate\"&gt;Barbary pirate&lt;/a&gt;s capturing that country's ships and crews. These passes identified ships which had safe passage.\nThe top of the British document was &lt;a href=\"indenture\"&gt;cut off in an erratic scalloped pattern&lt;/a&gt; used to confirm its authenticity. The matching top of the document was sent to officials along the Barbary Coast, so &lt;a href=\"cruiser\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s from those ports would have samples for comparison with the edge of the documents. A similar design was adopted by the United States, although U.S. Consul General in Algiers Richard O'Brien pointed out the document should be on thicker paper (or parchment) and kept in a tin container so as to ensure a better match between tops and bottoms (he also suggested that ships fly the &lt;a href=\"American%20flag\"&gt;American flag&lt;/a&gt; rather than the flags of individual states).\nCountries known to have issued such documents include:\nThe United States issued Mediterranean passports starting with a September 5, 1795, treaty with the Dey of Algiers,\nand continuing through the mid-19th century.\nBackground.\nFor about 300 years, the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt; lanes were largely controlled by the &lt;a href=\"north%20Africa\"&gt;north Africa&lt;/a&gt;n Muslim states of the &lt;a href=\"Barbary%20Coast\"&gt;Barbary Coast&lt;/a&gt; (Tripoli, Algiers, &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tunis\"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;) through &lt;a href=\"piracy\"&gt;piracy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hostage\"&gt;Hostage&lt;/a&gt;s were either &lt;a href=\"ransom\"&gt;ransom&lt;/a&gt;ed or sold into &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, most countries found it expedient to simply pay a yearly &lt;a href=\"tribute\"&gt;tribute&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"bribe\"&gt;bribe&lt;/a&gt;) to the Barbary &lt;a href=\"sultan\"&gt;sultan&lt;/a&gt;s in exchange for safe passage through the Mediterranean.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolution\"&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, the United States was no longer under the protection of the British tribute treaties, resulting in the crippling of American commerce in the Mediterranean. Having no significant &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. decided to form tribute treaties with the Barbary states, such as the 1796 &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Tripoli\"&gt;Treaty of Tripoli&lt;/a&gt;. This treaty required ship's passports within 18 months."
