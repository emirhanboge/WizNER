They formed a part of a colony and established themselves on the north shore of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Erie\"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt;. The parents of Melvin W. Mills, after a brief residence in Canada, moved to &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, United States. In 1860 his father immigrated to the west and nine years later, his wife and child followed.\nEducation.\nMills graduated from &lt;a href=\"Ann%20Arbor%20Law%20School\"&gt;Ann Arbor Law School&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Michigan\"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nHe joined his father at the Moreno Mines, &lt;a href=\"Colfax%20County%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Colfax County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and there began and continued the practice of law.\n&lt;a href=\"Colfax%20County%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Colfax County, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, in which spent his later years, had been the seat of many internal insurrections, and hundreds of people had been hung, shot, and killed in various ways over local difficulties. The law could not be enforced at times; the courts could not be held since the civil authorities where often at the mercy of the outlaws and worst types of desperados.\nWhile in &lt;a href=\"Cimarron%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Cimarron, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; he was twice elected to the territorial &lt;a href=\"legislature\"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt;, and has held various other offices such as county and city attorney for Elizabethtown, and was &lt;a href=\"District%20Attorney\"&gt;District Attorney&lt;/a&gt; for a number of counties.\nMelvin Mills owned a large ranch in Springer, New Mexico, while a cattle owner and was in control of one of the largest &lt;a href=\"mercantile\"&gt;mercantile&lt;/a&gt; and banking company at the time."
