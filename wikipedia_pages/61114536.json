    "text": "The Republican Party (; PLR) is a &lt;a href=\"Far-right%20politics\"&gt;far-right&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Chile\"&gt;political party&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;. Its founder and current leader is Chilean presidential candidate &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Kast\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast&lt;/a&gt;. The Republican Party is one of two parties in the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Social%20Front\"&gt;Christian Social Front&lt;/a&gt; coalition, along with the smaller &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Conservative%20Party%20%28Chile%29\"&gt;Christian Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Kast\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the party, was a deputy for 16 years, and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Democratic%20Union\"&gt;Independent Democratic Union (UDI)&lt;/a&gt; for 20 years. In 2017 &lt;a href=\"2017%20Chilean%20general%20election\"&gt;he ran for president&lt;/a&gt;, finishing in fourth place with nearly 8% of the vote.\nKast became disillusioned with UDI and resigned in protest, believing that the party criticized former Chilean dictator &lt;a href=\"Augusto%20Pinochet\"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt; too often.\nWith the base of support he obtained with the election, he decided to found a political movement.\nFoundation.\nThe Republican Party began as the Chilean manifestation of the &lt;a href=\"conservative%20wave\"&gt;conservative wave&lt;/a&gt; in Latin America. On 3 March 2018, Kast held the first meeting of (what at that time was) the new movement. Some time after, on 9 April, the movement was presented at the Omnium Hall in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Condes\"&gt;Las Condes&lt;/a&gt;, and it was named \"Acci\u00f3n Republicana\" (\"Republican Action\").\nOn 10 June 2019, Kast presented the party to the Servel, the party formation is still ongoing. More than half of the directive is composed of ex members of the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Democratic%20Union\"&gt;UDI&lt;/a&gt;. One of them is the only deputy the party has in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt;, Ignacio Urrutia.\nOn 21 January 2020, the Servel legally constituted the party in the regions of &lt;a href=\"O%27Higgins%20Region\"&gt;O'Higgins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maule%20Region\"&gt;Maule&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%91uble%20Region\"&gt;\u00d1uble&lt;/a&gt;, after the necessary amount of signs was presented.\nOn 14 August 2020, the party was officially constituted in the regions of &lt;a href=\"Biob%C3%ADo%20Region\"&gt;Biob\u00edo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Araucan%C3%ADa%20Region\"&gt;Araucan\u00eda&lt;/a&gt;, at the same time violent incidents related with the &lt;a href=\"Mapuche%20conflict\"&gt;Mapuche conflict&lt;/a&gt; were taking place in the zone.\nOn 9 September, the party was constituted in &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Metropolitan%20Region\"&gt;Santiago Metropolitan Region&lt;/a&gt;, and it was announced that it would present candidates to the municipal elections. On 19 July 2021, the party was constituted in the regions of Arica and Parinacota, Atacama, Ays\u00e9n and Magallanes, making it a national-level party, constituted in all Chilean regions.\nIdeology.\nThe Republican Party has been described as being &lt;a href=\"far-right%20politics\"&gt;far-right&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"authoritarian\"&gt;authoritarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nativism%20%28politics%29\"&gt;nativist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nationalism\"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"right-wing%20populism\"&gt;right-wing populist&lt;/a&gt;. Political scientist Crist\u00f3bal Rovira categorizes the party as belonging to a populist &lt;a href=\"Radical%20right%20%28Europe%29\"&gt;radical right&lt;/a&gt;, rather than far-right which is academically an incorrect label for the party. According to Political scientist Mireya D\u00e1vila the party contain some positions typical of the far-right, but notes also that far-right groups have also found expression in the older right-wing parties &lt;a href=\"National%20Renewal%20%28Chile%29\"&gt;National Renewal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Democratic%20Union\"&gt;Independent Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party's ideological doctrine is similar to the previously existing &lt;a href=\"Gremialismo\"&gt;Gremialismo&lt;/a&gt; and is the main group of \"&lt;a href=\"Pinochetism\"&gt;organic Pinochetism&lt;/a&gt;\", the new far-right in Chile, with the party receiving more support as &lt;a href=\"Centre-left%20politics\"&gt;centre-left&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Centre-right%20politics\"&gt;center-right&lt;/a&gt; parties began to reach a point of political convergence in the area policies and a perceived collusion in corruption as scandals arose. According to Cox and Blanco, the Republican Party appeared in Chilean politics in a similar manner to Spain's &lt;a href=\"Vox%20%28political%20party%29\"&gt;Vox&lt;/a&gt; party, with both parties splitting off from an existing right wing party to collect disillusioned voters. The Republican Party calls for measures to reduce &lt;a href=\"Illegal%20immigration%20to%20Chile\"&gt;illegal immigration&lt;/a&gt;, including building a ditch along the border with &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;. The party describes recent popular protests in Chile as ideological &lt;a href=\"terrorism\"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt; and frames indigenous movements as &lt;a href=\"narcoterrorism\"&gt;narcoterrorism&lt;/a&gt;. Regarding economic policy, the Republican Party supports &lt;a href=\"neoliberalism\"&gt;neoliberalism&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"market%20economy\"&gt;market economy&lt;/a&gt;, including cutting &lt;a href=\"tax\"&gt;tax&lt;/a&gt;es. The Republican Party holds &lt;a href=\"Social%20conservatism\"&gt;socially conservative&lt;/a&gt; views of a &lt;a href=\"Heteropatriarchy\"&gt;heteropatriarchal&lt;/a&gt; society and attaches itself to a traditional &lt;a href=\"Western%20Christianity\"&gt;Western Christianity&lt;/a&gt; point of view, supporting a &lt;a href=\"heterosexual\"&gt;heterosexual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20family\"&gt;nuclear family&lt;/a&gt; while opposing &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"assisted%20suicide\"&gt;assisted suicide&lt;/a&gt;.\nKast has been recognized as the main leader of the &lt;a href=\"extreme%20right\"&gt;extreme right&lt;/a&gt; for several years, consistently advocating &lt;a href=\"neoliberalism\"&gt;neoliberal&lt;/a&gt; economics, &lt;a href=\"anti-immigration\"&gt;anti-immigration&lt;/a&gt; policies and opposition to &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gay%20marriage\"&gt;gay marriage&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresidential candidates.\nThe following is a list of the presidential candidates supported by the Republican Party (information gathered from the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//eleccion.atspace.com/\"&gt;Archive of Chilean Elections&lt;/a&gt;): "
