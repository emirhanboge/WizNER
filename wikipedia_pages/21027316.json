    "text": "Acem Meditation is a &lt;a href=\"meditation\"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt; technique developed in &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; since 1966 by the &lt;a href=\"Acem%20School%20of%20Meditation\"&gt;Acem School of Meditation&lt;/a&gt; and is now taught in many countries.\nIt is non-religious, and its effects are attributed to psychological and physiological mechanisms. It is process-oriented, correct meditation being defined in terms of practice rather than experiences or states of mind. In contrast to many other forms of meditation, it makes no use of &lt;a href=\"concentration\"&gt;concentration&lt;/a&gt;, but instead allows spontaneous thoughts to come and go during the practice. According to Acem, this increases relaxation effects and stimulates long-term processes of &lt;a href=\"personal%20growth\"&gt;personal growth&lt;/a&gt;.\nTechnique.\nAcem Meditation involves the mental repetition of a simple sound, called a \"meditation sound\", a meaningless combination of vowels and consonants which is believed to help mind and body relax and to bring &lt;a href=\"Unconscious%20mind\"&gt;unconscious&lt;/a&gt; material closer to consciousness.\nThe way the meditator repeats the meditation sound is considered to be of paramount importance: the sound should be repeated with a so-called 'free mental attitude', i.e., in an effortless manner which does not require concentration and which allows thoughts, feelings and other impulses to come and go freely; forgetting the sound from time to time because one is absorbed by spontaneous thoughts is considered a central part of the technique.\nIn keeping with this emphasis on a free mental attitude, Acem does not recommend any meditation position that strains the &lt;a href=\"Human%20body\"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt;. The meditator should sit comfortably with good support for the lower back. &lt;a href=\"Meditation\"&gt;Meditation&lt;/a&gt; habits vary, but for long-term results 30 minutes twice a day or 45 minutes once a day is recommended.\nAcem Meditation offers beginner's courses, courses for established meditators, and retreats with long meditations. These courses emphasise &lt;a href=\"group%20dynamics\"&gt;group dynamics&lt;/a&gt; and encourage discussion of one's practice. Individual or group guidance is seen as a help to increase the effect of meditation, and sometimes provides opportunities for discussion of central life issues, which are believed to be reflected in one's meditative practice.\nLong meditations (i.e. meditations of more than an hour) followed by guidance are believed to provide deeper relaxation and increase the potential for personal growth. Most Acem centres arrange meetings with meditations of 1\u00bd to 2 hours. At retreats, the length of time is increased beyond the 3-hour level, and at so-called deepening retreats beyond the 6-hour level.\nResearch.\nIn recent years, an increasing amount of research has been carried out on the psychological and physiological effects of &lt;a href=\"meditation\"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt; techniques in general and of Acem Meditation in particular.\nIn his 2004 doctoral thesis from the Faculty of Medicine, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oslo\"&gt;University of Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, Norway, Dr. Erik Ekker Solberg explored the psychobiological effects of Acem Meditation.\nOne of his studies shows that Acem Meditation reduces heart rate, &lt;a href=\"blood%20pressure\"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and muscular tension. The heart rate reduction is stronger and more stable than at ordinary rest. A slow heart rate is usually considered to indicate &lt;a href=\"Relaxation%20%28psychology%29\"&gt;relaxation&lt;/a&gt;.\nDr. Solberg's research also suggests that advanced meditators have higher &lt;a href=\"melatonin\"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; levels than non-meditators (though melatonin decreases during long meditation), possibly an effect of long-term relaxation.\nIn a study of performance under stress, marksmen who had learned Acem Meditation improved their results in competition marksmanship, compared to a control group that did not learn meditation, indicating that Acem Meditation reduces the level of stress in tense and demanding situations.\nAnother study showed that the meditators had significantly lower blood lactate concentration after physical exercise than the control group, indicating faster recovery.\nIn a study on the effect of meditation on immune cells, Erik Solberg found that long term practice of meditation may influence absolute &lt;a href=\"lymphocyte%20count\"&gt;lymphocyte count&lt;/a&gt;s at rest. Runners practising meditation had lower lymphocyte counts at rest before the race.\nEffects.\nRelaxation is presented as a basic effect of Acem Meditation. The beneficial effects of the technique on insomnia, concentration problems, headaches and other bodily symptoms, social relations etc. are seen as extensions of the relaxation response elicited by the practice. Acem Meditation is often used as a tool in stress management, and Acem also arranges courses specifically designed to deal with &lt;a href=\"stress%20%28biological%29\"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor regular practitioners, however, Acem Meditation is typically seen as a method for long-term personal growth rather than just a &lt;a href=\"relaxation%20technique\"&gt;relaxation technique&lt;/a&gt;. According to Acem's psychology of meditation, meditation may help the individual to overcome some of the limitations set by his or her personality, leading to a freer frame of mind and a higher degree of receptivity and sensitivity. The same limitations that create problems for the person in his everyday life will also at times influence his meditation practice. For instance, a tense person may repeat the meditation sound too forcefully, while an evasive person may tend to be more passive in his meditation. Adjusting one's meditative practice is seen as a means to overcome such limitations, not only in meditation, but also in everyday life. The most important elements in Acem's psychological understanding of the technique are explained in the book \"Inner Strength\u00a0\u2014 the free mental attitude in Acem Meditation\".\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Are%20Holen\"&gt;Are Holen&lt;/a&gt; learned deep meditation (later called &lt;a href=\"Transcendental%20Meditation\"&gt;Transcendental Meditation&lt;/a&gt;) from &lt;a href=\"Mahesh%20Yogi\"&gt;Mahesh Yogi&lt;/a&gt; in 1962 and in January 1966 founded the Academic Meditation Society, precursor to the Acem School of Meditation, at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oslo\"&gt;University of Oslo&lt;/a&gt;. At first, he represented Mahesh Yogi in Norway, but Acem soon distanced itself from the &lt;a href=\"transcendental%20meditation\"&gt;transcendental meditation&lt;/a&gt; movement due to disagreements about methods and ideology.\nLiterature.\nInner Strength\u00a0\u2014 the free mental attitude of Acem Meditation, Acem Publishing, &lt;br&gt;\nAcem Meditation\u00a0\u2014 an introductory companion, Acem Publishing, \nFighting Stress\u00a0\u2014 Reviews of meditation research, Edited by Svend Davanger, Halvor Eifring and Anne Grete Hersoug, \nPsychology of Silence\u00a0\u2014 Perspectives on Acem meditation,\nThe Power of the Wandering Mind \u00a0\u2014 Nondirective Meditation in Science and Philosophy,\nExternal links.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.acem.com/\"&gt;Acem Meditation International&lt;/a&gt;"
