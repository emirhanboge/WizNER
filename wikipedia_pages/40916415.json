This article provides a list of constituencies constituting the Parliamentary representation from Derbyshire. \nIn 1889 Derbyshire became an administrative county and in 1974 much the same area became a shire county. &lt;a href=\"Derby\"&gt;Derby&lt;/a&gt; became a &lt;a href=\"unitary%20authority\"&gt;unitary authority&lt;/a&gt; in 1997, but it remains part of the &lt;a href=\"ceremonial%20county\"&gt;ceremonial county&lt;/a&gt; of Derbyshire.\nThe first part of this article covers the constituencies wholly or predominantly within the area of the historic county of Derbyshire, both before and after the administrative changes of 1889 and 1974. The second part refers to constituencies mostly in another historic county, which included some territory from the historic county of Derbyshire (if any). The summaries section only refers to the constituencies included in the first section of the constituency list.\nList of constituencies.\nArticle names are followed by (UK Parliament constituency). The constituencies which existed in 1707 were those previously represented in the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20England\"&gt;Parliament of England&lt;/a&gt;.\nKey to abbreviations:\nReferences.\n\"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.historyofparliamentonline.org/research\"&gt;History of Parliament&lt;/a&gt;\".
