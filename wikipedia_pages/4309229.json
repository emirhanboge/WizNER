    "text": "Walter Lawrence Burke (August 25, 1908 \u2013 August 4, 1984) was an American &lt;a href=\"character%20actor\"&gt;character actor&lt;/a&gt; of stage, film, and television whose career in entertainment spanned over a half century. Although he was a native of New York, Burke's &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; ancestry often led to his being cast in roles as an Irishman or Englishman. His small stature and distinctive voice and face also made him easily recognizable to audiences even when he was performing in minor supporting roles.\nEarly life and stage career.\nWalter Burke was born in the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"borough\"&gt;borough&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; to Irish immigrant parents Bedelia (&lt;a href=\"n%C3%A9e\"&gt;n\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; McNamara) and Thomas Burke.

The following year he performed in the musical revue \"Padlocks of 1927\" at the &lt;a href=\"Shubert%20Theatre%20%28Broadway%29\"&gt;Shubert Theatre&lt;/a&gt;. He then joined the &lt;a href=\"American%20Opera%20Company\"&gt;American Opera Company&lt;/a&gt;'s troupe in January 1928, performing a non-singing role in an English-language adaption of \"&lt;a href=\"Faust%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Faust&lt;/a&gt;\".
