    "text": "The Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment (&lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;: \"Wachregiment \"Feliks E. Dzierzynski\"\") was the &lt;a href=\"paramilitary\"&gt;paramilitary&lt;/a&gt; wing of the &lt;a href=\"Stasi\"&gt;Ministry for State Security&lt;/a&gt; (\"Stasi\"), the &lt;a href=\"Security%20agency\"&gt;security service&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;German Democratic Republic&lt;/a&gt; (GDR).\nThe Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment was called a regiment, however the elite formation gradually grew to the size of a &lt;a href=\"motorized%20infantry\"&gt;motorized infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; with its constituent \"Kommandos\" made up of battalions. Its role in the Stasi was the protection of buildings and high-ranking officials of the GDR government and the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Socialist Unity Party of Germany&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt was composed of experienced and ideologically reliable men separate from the &lt;a href=\"National%20People%27s%20Army\"&gt;National People's Army&lt;/a&gt; that could be deployed to suppress rebellion and unrest.\nHistory.\nThe Guards Battalion A at the MfS (\"Wachbataillon A beim MfS\") was founded on January 1, 1951 as an &lt;a href=\"armed%20force\"&gt;armed force&lt;/a&gt; to complement the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20for%20State%20Security%20%28East%20Germany%29\"&gt;Ministry for State Security&lt;/a&gt; (MfS or \"Stasi\"), the security service of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;German Democratic Republic&lt;/a&gt; (GDR). The GDR was a \"&lt;a href=\"de%20facto\"&gt;de facto&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"communist%20state\"&gt;communist state&lt;/a&gt; established in 1949 from the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Zone%20of%20Occupation\"&gt;Soviet Zone of Occupation&lt;/a&gt; and was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Socialist Unity Party of Germany&lt;/a&gt; (SED) with significant &lt;a href=\"Soviet\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; influence. Despite &lt;a href=\"authoritarian\"&gt;authoritarian&lt;/a&gt; measures to suppress &lt;a href=\"political%20opposition\"&gt;political opposition&lt;/a&gt;, the threat of instability remained. The SED followed the Soviet model of creating a dedicated elite and politically loyal armed force to protect itself. \nThe Guards Battalion A participated in the suppression of the &lt;a href=\"Uprising%20of%201953%20in%20East%20Germany\"&gt;Uprising of 1953&lt;/a&gt; against the SED's &lt;a href=\"Stalinization\"&gt;Stalinization&lt;/a&gt; policies. In November 1954, the Guards Battalion A was set up as the official &lt;a href=\"paramilitary\"&gt;paramilitary&lt;/a&gt; wing of the Stasi and its staff headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Adlershof\"&gt;Adlershof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Berlin\"&gt;East Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. In August 1961, units of the Guards Battalion A participated in the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Wall\"&gt;Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt;. In 1967, the Guards Battalion A was officially renamed the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment (\"Wachregiment \"Feliks E. Dzierzynski\"\") in honor of &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Edmundovich%20Dzerzhinsky\"&gt;Felix Dzerzhinsky&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href=\"Cheka\"&gt;Cheka&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment's major task was the protection of the SED, especially its buildings in the capital of &lt;a href=\"East%20Berlin\"&gt;East Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, and from 1960 providing security for the party leaders' private residential compound, &lt;a href=\"Waldsiedlung\"&gt;Waldsiedlung&lt;/a&gt;, located north of Berlin near &lt;a href=\"Wandlitz\"&gt;Wandlitz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Stasi was dissolved on 13 January 1990 and its facilities and responsibilities taken over by the GDR's Ministry of the Interior (\"Ministerium des Innern\"), but the regiment continued to exist. The Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment was formally dissolved on 2 October 1990, the day before the GDR was dissolved in the &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuties.\nWhile the FDGR's main duties is to ensure the safety of SED official and party members, it can also be mobilized to conduct some commando operations when required.\nScholarly research into the regiment after the end of the Cold War mentions that FDGR soldiers have trained PLO and other Middle Eastern and South American-based terrorists at a classified military base known as Objekt 74 at Briesen.\nOrganization.\nAt full strength, the regiment consisted of over 11,200 personnel, including 2,500 officers, 8,735 NCOs and enlisted men, and nine civil staff. Its commander was a &lt;a href=\"Major%20General\"&gt;Major General&lt;/a&gt; after 1956.\nStructure.\nReorganization.\nThe Regiment was subdivided into the following commands from 1980 to 1989:\nThe sites were inherited by the Ahrensfelde guard regiment in mid-January 1989. Until then they had formed accommodation facilities for UAV units of the Ministry for State Security (e.g., backup units of VRD, BDL, HA VI, AGMS). These units were the uniformed as well as the guard and security units of the units of the Stasi (BV), not a subdivision of the guards regiment. \nPart of these units were merged in January 1989 into the guard regiment, which is why the site was taken over by the Ahrensfelde guard regiment. \nUntil 1989, the guard regiment had no locations in the districts. The service objects there were guarded by the WSE, which were placed under the respective BV.\nSenior Management.\nCommanders of the guards regiment were:\nPersonnel Strength.\nThe personnel strength of the regiment:\nRecruitment and training.\nMilitary service in the Guard regiment was completed as WED (abbr. \"Wehrersatzdienst\", alternative military service). In contrast to the &lt;a href=\"National%20People%27s%20Army\"&gt;National People's Army&lt;/a&gt;, recruits were inducted in April and September / October, a month earlier.\nRecruits were selected from soldiers and NCOs who served in the NVA as volunteers for three years. Sometimes, service with the FDGR could potentially lead to a career in the Stasi. Most soldiers in the regiment are known to be parachute-qualified. Several players of &lt;a href=\"BFC%20Dynamo\"&gt;BFC Dynamo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SG%20Dynamo%20Dresden\"&gt;SG Dynamo Dresden&lt;/a&gt; made their military service with the regiment, such as &lt;a href=\"Lutz%20Eigendorf\"&gt;Lutz Eigendorf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Sammer\"&gt;Matthias Sammer&lt;/a&gt;. The head of the Stasi &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Mielke\"&gt;Erich Mielke&lt;/a&gt; was also the president of &lt;a href=\"SV%20Dynamo\"&gt;SV Dynamo&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt became publicly known in 2011 that the incumbent president of football club &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20Union%20Berlin\"&gt;1. FC Union Berlin&lt;/a&gt; Dirk Zingler was a member of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment for three years during his military service. Dirk Zingler has explained that he had sought to spend his military service in Berlin and that he was unaware beforehand that the regiment belonged to the Stasi. However, it was not possible to apply for the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment. The Stasi selected who it thought fit to serve with the regiment.\nEquipment.\nWeapons.\nThe FDGR received the same training and weapons as the \"&lt;a href=\"Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft\"&gt;Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft&lt;/a&gt;\" and some of its personnel were &lt;a href=\"paratrooper\"&gt;paratrooper&lt;/a&gt;s. It was also equipped with modern &lt;a href=\"armored%20fighting%20vehicle\"&gt;armored fighting vehicle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"armored%20personnel%20carriers\"&gt;armored personnel carriers&lt;/a&gt;, anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft weapons and mortars.\nThe regiment was equipped with small arms (&lt;a href=\"Makarov%20PM\"&gt;Makarov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walther%20PP\"&gt;Walther PP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PM-63%20RAK\"&gt;PM-63 RAK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AKM\"&gt;AKM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"AK-74\"&gt;AK-74&lt;/a&gt;, LMG, &lt;a href=\"RPG-7\"&gt;RPG-7&lt;/a&gt;). They were also reported to be armed with the &lt;a href=\"Wieger%20StG-940\"&gt;StG-943&lt;/a&gt; in 1989.\nStationed in the command 3 (on military Teupitz - cones), there was also a battalion of special weapons. It consisted of a company, which was armed with heavy anti-tank recoilless gun SPG-9 (in 1987, was reorganized into a rifle company), a company which is an essential weapon, the heavy machine gun (HMG-company) and had the 70mm - anti-aircraft missile armed \"Strela-2 'Company. Until 1982 there was also an artillery detachment armed with 122mm &lt;a href=\"122%20mm%20howitzer%202A18%20%28D-30%29\"&gt;D-30&lt;/a&gt; howitzer. Previously, they had 85-mm PaK D-44, and 82mm mortars and 120\u00a0mm in the stock.\n&lt;a href=\"traffic%20warden\"&gt;Regulator&lt;/a&gt;s company RSK was additionally can be equipped with the AKS-74 around the shoulder stock to collapse. At least in the 1970s, the former intelligence battalion, the mortar batteries and the I-battalion with Kalashnikovs in the S version were equipped. Specialized units such as the honor companies (28. and 29 MSK of the 10th MSB) were fitted in addition to the above-mentioned weapons, rifles and sabers.\nThe paratrooper company, located in the reconnaissance battalion, also used the small &lt;a href=\"%C5%A0korpion%20vz.%2061\"&gt;Skorpion&lt;/a&gt; machine pistol from &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor large events, there were as accessories &lt;a href=\"Baton%20%28law%20enforcement%29\"&gt;batons&lt;/a&gt; (flexible), down from 1989 shields and helmets and chains.\nVehicles.\nThe FDGR has access to light armored personnel carriers such as the BTR-60PB and the PSzH-IV.\nThe six Mi-2s and Mi-8s and Mi-24s are used for personnel transport.\nUniforms.\nIts &lt;a href=\"National%20People%27s%20Army%23Uniforms\"&gt;uniforms&lt;/a&gt; were nearly identical to those of the &lt;a href=\"National%20People%27s%20Army%23Uniforms%202regular\"&gt;National People's Army&lt;/a&gt; (NVA) and were distinguished primarily by the dark red MfS service color of its insignia and by a cuff title on the left sleeve bearing the regiment's name. Other Stasi officers wore a similar uniform, but without the cuffband. \nThe service or dress uniform of the regiment was an army uniform made of high quality (of officers) with &lt;a href=\"claret\"&gt;claret&lt;/a&gt; fabric collar and brown (officer) leather belt. The left sleeve was fitted with a cuffband and the words \"wachregiment F. Dzerzhinsky\".\nSoldiers of the MOS units typically had the following personal uniforms:\nIn command 4 - Eberswalde-Finow in Bernau contributed UAZ, professional officers and professional officers uniforms of the regular army with weapons Color black (pioneers) and (white Motorized Rifle) to camouflage the Wachregimentseinsatzes.
