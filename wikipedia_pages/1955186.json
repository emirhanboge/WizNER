Alternative names are Rudari (Ludari), Lingurari and Zl\u0103tari.\nHistory.\nThe Boyash are a branch/&lt;a href=\"caste\"&gt;caste&lt;/a&gt; of the Roma who were forced to settle in the 14th century in the &lt;a href=\"Apuseni%20Mountains\"&gt;Apuseni Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt;, and work as &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; (a regionalism for \"mine\" in Romanian: \"baie,\" from Middle Age &lt;a href=\"Old%20Church%20Slavonic\"&gt;Slavonic&lt;/a&gt;).\nAt the end of the 16th century the Boyash started migrating towards the south, in &lt;a href=\"Wallachia\"&gt;Wallachia&lt;/a&gt;, and the east, in &lt;a href=\"Moldavia\"&gt;Moldavia&lt;/a&gt;, where they were held as slaves together with other Romani groups (until the &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20Romania\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; was abolished in 1855\u201356).\nAnother name for the Boyash, \"Rudari\", comes from the &lt;a href=\"Slavic%20languages\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt; \"ruda\" (\"metal\", \"ore\"). As the mines became inefficient, the Boyash people were forced to readjust by earning their living making &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"food%20utensil\"&gt;utensil&lt;/a&gt;s (\"Lingurari\" means \"&lt;a href=\"spoon\"&gt;spoon&lt;/a&gt;-makers\" in Romanian; also cf. &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20language\"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; \"ruda\", &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20language\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; \"r\u00fad\", &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; \"rud\u0103\" meaning \"relative\", but also \"rod, pole, stick\"). The nickname \"Kashtale\" (\"wood-workers\") was also given to them by the Romani-speaking Roma and it has remained in Romani as a more general word for a Rom who does not speak Romani.\nAfter the point at which they began to make wood tools they scattered themselves in isolated communities. The consequence of this is that nowadays they speak a distinct archaic dialect of Romanian, with borrowings from other surrounding languages.\nPopulation.\nAfter the liberation of the Roma from slavery (by the middle of the 19th century), many &lt;a href=\"emigration\"&gt;emigrated&lt;/a&gt; to other countries, especially &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Balkans\"&gt;the Balkans&lt;/a&gt;, but also as far as the &lt;a href=\"Americas\"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1993, about 14,000 of the 280,000 recorded Hungarian Roma were Boyash.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, the Boyash are settled in several small communities along the Hungarian border in the regions of &lt;a href=\"Me%C4%91imurje\"&gt;Me\u0111imurje&lt;/a&gt;, the Podravina, &lt;a href=\"Slavonija\"&gt;Slavonija&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baranja%20region\"&gt;Baranja&lt;/a&gt; with an overflow of settlers living in the &lt;a href=\"Apatin\"&gt;Apatin&lt;/a&gt; county of &lt;a href=\"Vojvodina\"&gt;Vojvodina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;. 2005 saw the Boyash language of Croatia published in its own &lt;a href=\"alphabet\"&gt;alphabet&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in the &lt;a href=\"Catechism%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Catechism&lt;/a&gt;, published by the HBK Glas Koncila in Zagreb. In 2007, the first Bible\u2014a children's Bible\u2014was published by OM EAST in Austria and facilitated by The Romani Bible Union.\nNames in other languages.\nIn English, the commonly accepted name for the ethnic group is \"Boyash\", however in contemporary &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; the terms \"Ludari\" and \"Rudari\" are in common use, while in &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; both terms are present in some form: \"Rudari\" and \"B\u0103ie\u0219i\".\nFor the same ethnic group in &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; the terms \"Beyash\" and \"Bayash\" (Baja\u0161i) are now officially used. The ethnonym \"Banyash\" (\"miner\") in &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; is known only among the group settled in &lt;a href=\"Ba%C4%8Dka\"&gt;Ba\u010dka&lt;/a&gt; region, living along the river &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt;, near the border with &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. This term is only sporadically understood, and not used among some other &lt;a href=\"Banyash\"&gt;Banyash&lt;/a&gt; groups in the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Banat\"&gt;Serbian Banat&lt;/a&gt; region, e.g. the village of &lt;a href=\"Uljma\"&gt;Uljma&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are also known by many appellations based on trades; in addition to Rudari/Ludari (\"miners\", from Serbian and Bulgarian \"ruda\" \"ore, metal\") they are known as \"Kopanari\" (\"cradle-makers\", from Serbian and Bulgarian \"kopanja\" \"wooden box\"), \"Koritari\" (\"trough-makers\"), \"Lingurara\" (\"spoon-makers\", cf. Romanian \"lingur\u0103\" \"spoon\") and \"Ursari\" (cf. Romanian \"urs\" \"bear\") or \"Mechkara\" (\"bear-trainers\").\nEducation.\nEducation in the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian language&lt;/a&gt; is available only for the Banyash living in &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n villages in the Serbian &lt;a href=\"Banat\"&gt;Banat&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in Hungary, in the subdialect of the Romanian language spoken by Boyash communities in (central and western) Hungary.\nDuring the last few years there have been several attempts on behalf of local non-governmental organizations in East Ba\u010dka region to introduce optional classes in &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt;. According to 2004 field research data, only two such projects are still going on there: optional classes in &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; in the village of &lt;a href=\"Vajska\"&gt;Vajska&lt;/a&gt;, and kindergarten in the local Ardeal dialect in &lt;a href=\"Ba%C4%8Dki%20Mono%C5%A1tor\"&gt;Ba\u010dki Mono\u0161tor&lt;/a&gt;, attended by 20 pupils altogether.\nReferences.\nNotes\nBibliography\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DM10xAQAAIAAJ%26amp%3Bq%3Dboyash%2Bgypsies%26amp%3Bdq%3Dboyash%2Bgypsies%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Bved%3D0ahUKEwjZy9Wv38zkAhWEup4KHb5SBPYQ6AEIKTAA\"&gt;Studies about Boyash Gypsies in Hungary&lt;/a&gt; Studies about Boyash Gypsies in Hungary book\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//books.google.com\"&gt;Google Books Zsuzsanna B\u00f3di - 1997&lt;/a&gt;"
