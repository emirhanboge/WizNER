    "text": "The Natural Area Reserves System (NARS) of Hawaii is a statewide attempt to preserve in perpetuity specific land and water areas which support communities, as relatively unmodified as possible, of the natural &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;, as well as geological sites, of &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEstablished in 1970 by Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 195, the system presently consists of 19 reserves on five islands, encompassing more than of the State's &lt;a href=\"ecosystem\"&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;s. The diverse areas found in the NARS range from marine and coastal environments to &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flows, &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20tropical%20rainforests\"&gt;tropical rainforest&lt;/a&gt;s, and even an alpine &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;. Within these areas one can find rare &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; plants and animals, many of which are on the edge of extinction.\nThe Natural Area Reserves System is administered by the &lt;a href=\"Hawaii%20Department%20of%20Land%20and%20Natural%20Resources\"&gt;Department of Land and Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt;, Division of Forestry and Wildlife. Currently, management teams are working to control the encroachment of non-native plants and animals which threaten the existence of the natural biota on the reserves.\nThe reserves include:"
