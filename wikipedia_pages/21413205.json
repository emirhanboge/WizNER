    "text": "The English Lop is a fancy breed of &lt;a href=\"domestic%20rabbit\"&gt;domestic rabbit&lt;/a&gt; that was developed in England in the 19th century through &lt;a href=\"selective%20breeding\"&gt;selective breeding&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed to be the first breed of lop rabbit developed by humans, and it may be one of the oldest breeds of domestic rabbit. Averaging 11 pounds (5.5\u00a0kg), the English Lop is characterized by its distinctively long lop ears, bold head, and large body size.\nHistory.\nAs the first lop breed, the English Lop was developed in England in the 19th century for exhibition as an early \"fancy\" breed\u2014in response to the rising &lt;a href=\"animal%20fancy\"&gt;animal fancy&lt;/a&gt; of the time. During the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt;, the English Lop emerged as a mainstream household pet, marking a departure for such \"fancy\" breeds from the earlier role of the domesticated rabbit as a source of meat, &lt;a href=\"Rabbit%20hair\"&gt;fur&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; production. Later, the English Lop was bred with other rabbit breeds from the continent, giving rise to new lop breeds that include the &lt;a href=\"French%20Lop\"&gt;French Lop&lt;/a&gt; (from English Lop / &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Giant\"&gt;Flemish Giant&lt;/a&gt; crosses) and the &lt;a href=\"Holland%20Lop\"&gt;Holland Lop&lt;/a&gt; (from French Lop / &lt;a href=\"Netherland%20Dwarf\"&gt;Netherland Dwarf&lt;/a&gt; crosses).\nAppearance.\nThe English Lop, though longer and more slender in body than other lop breeds, has ears up to in length tip to tip\u2014the longest ears of any rabbit breed. The ears of English Lops reach the end of their growth at approximately 5 months of age, although the ears of males can gain as much as an inch .\nEnglish Lops are bred in both solids and brokens (colors broken by white) and within this, they can come in several different colours, including (but not limited to) Black, orange/fawn, blue, agouti/opal, chinchilla, Red Eyed White, and blue and black torts. The &lt;a href=\"American%20Rabbit%20Breeders%20Association\"&gt;American Rabbit Breeders Association&lt;/a&gt; allows all recognized lop colors to be shown in either Solid or Broken groups other than pointed whites. English lops have a smooth, 'flyback' short coat, and their ears should be properly furred and silky to the touch. In body they should resemble a mandolin cut in half, a wide nose and broad head with no visible crown, long, loose hanging ears, strong shoulders and a rise that results in a round, deep body over the hips and flanks. Does can weigh 10\u201315 lbs, with bucks generally weighing 9\u201312 lbs.\nLifestyle.\nThe English Lop needs a relatively large &lt;a href=\"hutch%20%28animal%20cage%29\"&gt;hutch&lt;/a&gt; or a shed/aviary conversion so it has room to move about without standing on its ears. It is common for a wooden hutch made of a heavy &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; with a waterproof roof, and raised off the ground to be provided if the rabbit is living outdoors, or a wooden hutch or &lt;a href=\"Cage%20%28enclosure%29\"&gt;cage&lt;/a&gt; if it is kept indoors. The cage would have a (not wire) with a wire lid fixed to the base. All rabbits must have an adequate exercise area, whether it is an outside run or an enclosed area in the house. The floor of the cage or hutch should be covered with soft material such as hay or blankets (woodshavings can cause respiratory problems), and in cold or wet weather, bedding material, such as &lt;a href=\"straw\"&gt;straw&lt;/a&gt; can be provided for the outdoor rabbit. It is recommended that the rabbit hutch or &lt;a href=\"Cage%20%28enclosure%29\"&gt;cage&lt;/a&gt; be cleaned out weekly and any old food, bedding be removed every three days to prevent soiling of the fur and special hutch &lt;a href=\"disinfectants\"&gt;disinfectants&lt;/a&gt; be used to prevent the spread of &lt;a href=\"bacteria\"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. Also, an earthenware food bowl and a drinking bottle will also be required to feed and water the rabbit. Water bowls are not recommended as they will get their ears wet. Unlike other breeds, the English Lop will only require mild attention to &lt;a href=\"Personal%20grooming\"&gt;grooming&lt;/a&gt; due to its short-hair. They can cope with hot weather provided they have cool shade to rest in and are out of direct sunlight but in the cold their ears are at risk of frostbite so they should be kept in an enclosed warm, dry area out of cold draughts.\nBehaviour.\nAdult English Lops are often referred to as the \"dogs of the rabbit world\". They are generally known to be quite placid (even lazy), outgoing, curious and friendly. They can make wonderful pets for children, although as a large breed rabbit any interaction between child and rabbit should be supervised.\nFeeding.\nDue to its relaxed and placid temperament, the English Lop is known to be relatively inactive. Like the majority of rabbits, the most Legume hays are higher in &lt;a href=\"protein\"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"calories\"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"calcium\"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;, which in excess can cause kidney stones and loose stool. This type of hay should be reserved for young kits or lactating does. \nIt is recommended that the English Lop, like other rabbits, receive a standard intake of 2 cups of a good, quality pellet, with 16\u201318% plant protein, unlimited grass hay, and constant access to fresh clean water. It is common for some owners to provide treats, although in very limited quantities, which can include a slice of &lt;a href=\"strawberry\"&gt;strawberry&lt;/a&gt;, or other healthy foods. Commercial treats are available in the pet stores in shops and can be occasionally used, although even more sparingly, since they typically feature a higher &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"starch\"&gt;starch&lt;/a&gt; content.\nSome of the vegetables that rabbits enjoy are &lt;a href=\"escarole\"&gt;escarole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"turnips\"&gt;turnips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"collards\"&gt;collards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kale\"&gt;kale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"parsley\"&gt;parsley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"thyme\"&gt;thyme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cilantro\"&gt;cilantro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dandelion\"&gt;dandelion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"basil\"&gt;basil&lt;/a&gt;. The green, leafy tops of &lt;a href=\"radishes\"&gt;radish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s also are excellent sources of nutrients\u2014more than the vegetable itself. New vegetables should be introduced slowly due to the delicate digestive systems of rabbits. It is recommended that &lt;a href=\"cauliflower\"&gt;cauliflower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"broccoli\"&gt;broccoli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cabbage\"&gt;cabbage&lt;/a&gt; be avoided, as they cause gas and can lead to gastrointestinal stasis, which can be fatal. Vegetables such as &lt;a href=\"potatoes\"&gt;potatoes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;corn&lt;/a&gt; should also avoided due to their high &lt;a href=\"starch\"&gt;starch&lt;/a&gt; content. English Lops also require an unlimited amount of fresh water, usually provided for in a water crock, tip-proof ceramic pet dish, or hanging water bottle.\nHealth.\nDue to the large ear size, English lops are slightly more vulnerable to a number of health problems, particularly ear infections, and it is advised that the ears should be checked periodically, especially for excess wax that can be accumulated on their deep ear canals and cleaned when appropriate. Ear blemishes can be kept to a minimum by keeping the toenails clipped, which can prevent injuries arising from the rabbit treading on its ears. The large surface area of its ears and body, and the absence of a dense undercoat can result in greater heat loss, which can become a problem for outdoor rabbits in cold climates and winters, and in the onset of these conditions, special measures should be taken to insulate the hutch, such as the provision of increased bedding and hay, and draft excluders. In freezing conditions, an English Lop should never be given a water dish or crock, since wet ears will &lt;a href=\"Frostbite\"&gt;freeze&lt;/a&gt;. Accordingly, English Lops do better in heat than many other rabbit breeds, due to the cooling factor of their large ears. However, any temperature over is considered dangerously high and care should be made to ensure the rabbit has plenty of shade, fresh water, or cool surface to lie against. An English Lop can live in either a solid bottom hutch or cage with bedding provided, or an adequately spaced wire bottom cage provided they have a thick resting board/pad to prevent injury to hocks.\nBreeding.\nThe ideal age for the female English Lop rabbit to start &lt;a href=\"animal%20husbandry\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt; is 10 months of age. The female English Lop rabbit is known to be particularly prolific, with rich &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, and a good maternal sense, and can produce large &lt;a href=\"litters\"&gt;litters&lt;/a&gt; of 5\u201312, with a gestation period of 28\u201335 days. On average they give birth at 30\u201332 days. It is during the first 16 weeks of an English Lop's life that its ears undergo their most rapid growth, and for this period, theirs ears will require special care and attention. Although a baby English Lop is usually born with normal-sized ears, for a month, each week the ears' size will double. At about four weeks old, the ears will be longer than the English Lop's body and the rabbits will be prone to accidents or injuries, such as tripping over their ears, or accidentally scratching them frequently, and more care should be given during this initial stage.\nRecords.\nOn November 1, 2003 the ears of an English Lop called Nipper's Geronimo were measured at 79\u00a0cm (31.125\u00a0in) in a complete span at the American Rabbit Breeders Association National Convention in &lt;a href=\"Wichita%2C%20Kansas\"&gt;Wichita, Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, USA and are recorded as the largest measured ear-span of a rabbit, and a Guinness World Record."
