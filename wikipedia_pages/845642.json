    "title": "Variable-length intake manifold",
    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"internal%20combustion%20engine\"&gt;internal combustion engine&lt;/a&gt;s, a variable-length intake manifold (VLIM),variable intake manifold (VIM), or variable intake system (VIS) is an &lt;a href=\"automobile\"&gt;automobile&lt;/a&gt; internal combustion engine &lt;a href=\"Inlet%20manifold\"&gt;manifold&lt;/a&gt; technology. As the name implies, VLIM/VIM/VIS can vary the length of the intake tract - in order to optimise &lt;a href=\"power%20%28physics%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"torque\"&gt;torque&lt;/a&gt; across the range of engine speed operation, as well as help provide better &lt;a href=\"fuel%20efficiency\"&gt;fuel efficiency&lt;/a&gt;. This effect is often achieved by having two separate intake ports, each controlled by a valve, that open two different manifolds - one with a short path that operates at full engine load, and another with a significantly longer path that operates at lower load. The first patent issued for a variable length intake manifold was published in 1958, US Patent US2835235 by &lt;a href=\"Daimler%20Benz%20AG\"&gt;Daimler Benz AG&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two main effects of variable intake geometry:\nApplications.\nMany &lt;a href=\"automotive%20industry\"&gt;automobile manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; use similar technology with different names. Another common term for this technology is variable resonance induction system (VRIS)."
