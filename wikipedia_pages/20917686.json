    "text": "Knob Noster State Park is a public recreation area covering in &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20County%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Johnson County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, in the United States. The &lt;a href=\"state%20park\"&gt;state park&lt;/a&gt; bears the name of the nearby town of &lt;a href=\"Knob%20Noster%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Knob Noster&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is named for one of two small hills or \"knobs\" that rise up in an otherwise flat section of Missouri. &lt;a href=\"Noster%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;Noster&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adjective\"&gt;adjective&lt;/a&gt; meaning \"our\"\u2014therefore, \"Knob Noster\" translates as \"our hill.\" A local &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; belief stated that the hills were \"raised up as monuments to slain warriors.\" The park offers year-round &lt;a href=\"camping\"&gt;camping&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hiking\"&gt;hiking&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; and is managed by the &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20Department%20of%20Natural%20Resources\"&gt;Missouri Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe park was called the Montserrat National &lt;a href=\"Recreational%20Demonstration%20Area\"&gt;Recreational Demonstration Area&lt;/a&gt; when it was created in the 1930s as part of a nationwide effort by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Park%20Service\"&gt;National Park Service&lt;/a&gt; to show how land that had been cleared for &lt;a href=\"lumbering\"&gt;lumbering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt; could be restored and reclaimed for public recreational purposes. The park was constructed by the &lt;a href=\"Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps\"&gt;Civilian Conservation Corps&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Works%20Progress%20Administration\"&gt;Works Progress Administration&lt;/a&gt;. The men of the CCC and WPA built roads, bridges, camping areas, picnic areas, and park service buildings. The park was transferred to the state of Missouri in 1946 and renamed for the city of Knob Noster.\nHistoric sites.\nThe park includes several demonstration area resources dating from the 1930s that were listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1985:\nEcology.\nThe Knob Noster area was described in 1861 during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20American\"&gt;Confederate&lt;/a&gt; soldier, Ephraim McDowell Anderson, as an area of \"beautiful &lt;a href=\"prairie\"&gt;prairie&lt;/a&gt;s, dotted with clumps of trees.\" The park lies in the &lt;a href=\"Osage%20Plains\"&gt;Osage Plains&lt;/a&gt;, a transition zone between prairie and forest. Tall wild grasses and wild flowers grow among scattered trees making habitat similar to a &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;. Since settlement, the savanna has been overgrown with trees as the land is transitioning to a forest. Efforts are underway to restore some parts of the park to its original condition through controlled burning.\nClearfork Creek is a slow flowing &lt;a href=\"meander\"&gt;meander&lt;/a&gt;ing creek that passes through the park. It provides water for a corridor of trees along its banks. The trees growing along the banks and in other parts of the park include &lt;a href=\"Asimina%20triloba\"&gt;pawpaw&lt;/a&gt;, various species of &lt;a href=\"hickory\"&gt;hickory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Celtis\"&gt;hackberry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cercis\"&gt;redbud&lt;/a&gt;. The creek, prairie and woods provide a habitat for numerous birds and mammals including &lt;a href=\"great%20blue%20heron\"&gt;great blue heron&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pileated%20woodpecker\"&gt;pileated woodpecker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wild%20turkey\"&gt;wild turkey&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"white-tailed%20deer\"&gt;white-tailed deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"opossum\"&gt;opossum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"raccoon\"&gt;raccoon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"screech%20owl\"&gt;screech owl&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"eastern%20bluebird\"&gt;eastern bluebird&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA section of the park has been specially designated as a protected natural area. Pin Oak Slough Natural Area is in a former &lt;a href=\"Oxbow%20lake\"&gt;oxbow&lt;/a&gt; slough of &lt;a href=\"Clearfork%20Creek\"&gt;Clearfork Creek&lt;/a&gt;. The area is a &lt;a href=\"wet-mesic\"&gt;wet-mesic&lt;/a&gt; forest and shrub &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;. Water pools during spring in depressions making &lt;a href=\"vernal%20pool\"&gt;vernal pool&lt;/a&gt;s. Trees growing in the Pin Oak Natural Area include &lt;a href=\"Quercus%20palustris\"&gt;pin oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quercus%20bicolor\"&gt;swamp white oak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quercus%20macrocarpa\"&gt;bur oak&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Acer%20saccharinum\"&gt;silver maple&lt;/a&gt;. The rare &lt;a href=\"Platanthera%20flava\"&gt;pale green orchid&lt;/a&gt; can also be found in the natural area.\nGeology.\nKnob Noster State Park and the Osage Plains are underlain by soft &lt;a href=\"shale\"&gt;shale&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Mississippian%20age\"&gt;Mississippian&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvanian%20%28geology%29\"&gt;Pennsylvanian&lt;/a&gt; age. Some of the rocks prevalent in the Osage Plains are Mississippian limestone, limestone shale, &lt;a href=\"Ordovician\"&gt;Ordovician&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dolomite%20%28rock%29\"&gt;dolomite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;. There are also clay and shale within the Pennsylvanian bedrock.\nRecreation.\nKnob Knoster State Park is open for year-round recreation. Two lakes, Buteo and Clearfork, and Clearfork Creek are open to fishing. The most common game fish are &lt;a href=\"channel%20catfish\"&gt;channel catfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crappie\"&gt;crappie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bass%20%28fish%29\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bluegill\"&gt;bluegill&lt;/a&gt;. Small boats and electric trolling motors are permitted on the lakes. Several picnic areas are spread throughout the park on the shores of the various lakes. Three picnic pavilions are available. Five different types of camping areas are available at Knob Noster State Park. There are basic campsites with a fire ring and pad, electric campsites are similar to the basic, only with electric hook-ups, &lt;a href=\"Equestrianism\"&gt;equestrian&lt;/a&gt; campsites have facilities for horses and the special-use and group camping areas are provided."
