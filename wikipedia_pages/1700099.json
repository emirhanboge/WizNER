The \"Frew\" wear a home shirt of blue and white stripes\nHistory.\nRenfrew formed in 1912 after the previous Junior club in the town, Renfrew Victoria, went defunct in 1910; they also played at Western Park. A \"senior\" club based in Renfrew had also operated in the 19th century, and competed in the early years of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe early years of the club saw the semi-finals of the national competition, the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt;, reached several times \u2013 in 1914, 1918, 1933, 1936, 1947 and more recently 1978. The final has been reached three times, in 1917, 1962 and 2001. The first occasion saw no goals conceded on the way to the final, and it was only by a single goal that the final itself was lost, and this after a replay. Similarly, it was after a replay in 1962, when &lt;a href=\"Kirkintilloch%20Rob%20Roy%20F.C.\"&gt;Rob Roy&lt;/a&gt; were the victors.\nHowever, May 2001 saw Renfrew win their first Scottish Cup after defeating &lt;a href=\"Carnoustie%20Panmure%20F.C.\"&gt;Carnoustie Panmure&lt;/a&gt; in the final at &lt;a href=\"Firhill%20Stadium\"&gt;Firhill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;. After a tense 90 minutes of regulation time and 30 minutes of &lt;a href=\"Overtime%20%28sports%29\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt;, Renfrew won the match on penalties with captain Neil Shearer scoring the winner.\nOn 8 August 2015, New Western Park opened its doors with a 2\u20130 home win for Renfrew against &lt;a href=\"Renfrewshire\"&gt;Renfrewshire&lt;/a&gt; neighbours &lt;a href=\"Johnstone%20Burgh%20F.C.\"&gt;Johnstone Burgh&lt;/a&gt;.\nHonours.\n&lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association%2C%20West%20Region\"&gt;SJFA West&lt;/a&gt;"
