    "text": "The People Power Party (), formerly known as the United Future Party () is a &lt;a href=\"Conservatism%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;political party&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party was formed on 17 February 2020 by the merger of the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Korea%20Party\"&gt;Liberty Korea Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Conservative%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;New Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Onward%20for%20Future%204.0\"&gt;Onward for Future 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, as well as several minor parties and political organizations. Following the &lt;a href=\"2020%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2020 legislative election&lt;/a&gt;, it became the 2nd largest party in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, with 103 MPs.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nDue to the &lt;a href=\"2016%20South%20Korean%20political%20scandal\"&gt;political scandal&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20South%20Korea\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Park%20Geun-hye\"&gt;Park Geun-hye&lt;/a&gt; was impeached, and several &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20parliament\"&gt;MPs&lt;/a&gt; quit the then-ruling &lt;a href=\"Saenuri%20Party\"&gt;Saenuri Party&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Bareun%20Party\"&gt;Bareun Party&lt;/a&gt;. The Saenuri Party changed its name to the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Korea%20Party\"&gt;Liberty Korea Party&lt;/a&gt; (LKP), but following the &lt;a href=\"Impeachment%20of%20Park%20Geun-hye\"&gt;final impeachment of Park&lt;/a&gt; on 10 March 2017, it \"de jure\" lost its ruling party position. After the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidate &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Jae-in\"&gt;Moon Jae-in&lt;/a&gt; was elected on 9 May, the LKP officially became the main opposition.\nAlthough several Bareun MPs returned to the LKP, the LKP did not recover its support, losing ground in the &lt;a href=\"2018%20South%20Korean%20local%20elections\"&gt;2018 local elections&lt;/a&gt;. Its president, &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Jun-pyo\"&gt;Hong Jun-pyo&lt;/a&gt;, immediately resigned to take responsibility for the serious defeat. The Bareun Party, which had merged with the smaller &lt;a href=\"centrism\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%2C%202016%29\"&gt;People's Party&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Bareunmirae%20Party\"&gt;Bareunmirae Party&lt;/a&gt;, also faced a defeat in the local elections.\nThe two conservative parties held snap leadership elections. &lt;a href=\"2018%20Bareunmirae%20Party%20leadership%20election\"&gt;On 2 September 2018&lt;/a&gt;, the Bareunmirae Party elected &lt;a href=\"Sohn%20Hak-kyu\"&gt;Sohn Hak-kyu&lt;/a&gt; as its new president. &lt;a href=\"2019%20Liberty%20Korea%20Party%20leadership%20election\"&gt;On 27 February 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the Liberty Korea Party elected former &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20South%20Korea\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hwang%20Kyo-ahn\"&gt;Hwang Kyo-ahn&lt;/a&gt; as its new leader. &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Un-ju\"&gt;Lee Un-ju&lt;/a&gt;, a Bareunmirae MP, quit her party and was widely expected to join the LKP but formed a new party named &lt;a href=\"Onward%20for%20Future%204.0\"&gt;Onward for Future 4.0&lt;/a&gt;. With the exit of the Bareunmirae Party's President Sohn, other former Bareun MPs faced conflicts and founded the &lt;a href=\"New%20Conservative%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;New Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;. As a \"conservative union\", the Liberty Korea Party, Onward for Future 4.0, and the New Conservative Party agreed to merge and establish a new party.\nThe new party's name was initially set as the Grand Unified New Party (&lt;a href=\"Korean%20language\"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt;: \ub300\ud1b5\ud569\uc2e0\ub2f9), but soon changed to United Future Party (&lt;a href=\"Korean%20language\"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt;: \ubbf8\ub798\ud1b5\ud569\ub2f9). &lt;a href=\"Park%20Hyung-joon\"&gt;Park Hyung-joon&lt;/a&gt;, who led the merger and re-foundation, explained that the name shows support for youths and political solidarity.\nFounding congress.\nFollowing the merger and re-foundation of the 3 conservative parties into the United Future Party (UFP) on 17 February 2020, it elected the Liberty Korea Party's President Hwang Kyo-ahn as the new president. Though much of the UFP's leadership resembles that of the LKP, Vice-presidents &lt;a href=\"Won%20Hee-ryong\"&gt;Won Hee-ryong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Y%C5%8Fng-hwan\"&gt;Kim Y\u014fng-hwan&lt;/a&gt; are not from the LKP.\nThe President of the Republic of Korea Moon Jae-in and the Democratic Party Leader &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Hae-chan\"&gt;Lee Hae-chan&lt;/a&gt; congratulated the new party's founding, but the move was not welcomed by other members. Some sources reported that the party is planning to file a lawsuit against Moon.\n&lt;a href=\"Yoo%20Seong-min\"&gt;Yoo Seong-min&lt;/a&gt;, the former Bareunmirae president, did not attend the founding congress. Yoo Young-ha, who is in support of Park Geun-hye, exited the LKP before the formation of the new party.\n2020\u20132021.\nThe party contested as an alliance with its sister &lt;a href=\"satellite%20party\"&gt;satellite party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Future%20Korea%20Party\"&gt;Future Korea Party&lt;/a&gt; (FKP), in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2020 elections&lt;/a&gt;. However, some UFP candidates provoked controversies for defamatory remarks, such as &lt;a href=\"Cha%20Myong-jin\"&gt;Cha Myong-jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Dae-ho%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Kim Dae-ho&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party was defeated in the election with some of the worst results historically for a conservative party in South Korea. The UFP won 103 out of 300 seats in the National Assembly, slightly over one-third of the seats. The party lost several key figures, including &lt;a href=\"Oh%20Se-hoon\"&gt;Oh Se-hoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Na%20Kyung-won\"&gt;Na Kyung-won&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shim%20Jae-chul\"&gt;Shim Jae-chul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Jin-tae%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Kim Jin-tae&lt;/a&gt;. Party Leader &lt;a href=\"Hwang%20Kyo-ahn\"&gt;Hwang Kyo-ahn&lt;/a&gt;, who contested for &lt;a href=\"Jongno%20District\"&gt;Jongno&lt;/a&gt;, was defeated by former &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20South%20Korea\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Nak-yeon\"&gt;Lee Nak-yeon&lt;/a&gt;. Hwang announced that he would stand down as the party president.\nFollowing Hwang's resignation, it was reported that the party would temporarily establish the Emergency Planning Committee, led by &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Chong-in\"&gt;Kim Chong-in&lt;/a&gt;. Several members, such as &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Young-woo%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Kim Young-woo&lt;/a&gt;, disagreed with the establishment of the committee. Hong Jun-pyo, who showed an intention to return to the UFP, also opposed the proposal and revealed Kim's past corruption allegations.\nOn 8 May, &lt;a href=\"Joo%20Ho-young\"&gt;Joo Ho-young&lt;/a&gt; was elected the UFP's Floor Leader, automatically becoming the party's interim Leader. On 22 May, the party held an election to nominate Kim Chong-in as the interim President until the next &lt;a href=\"2021%20South%20Korean%20by-elections\"&gt;by-elections&lt;/a&gt; on 7 April 2021, which he accepted. The same day, the FKP announced its merger by 29 May. On 28 May, both the UFP and FKP officially declared their merger as the unified UFP.\nOn 13 August, Realmeter had revealed an opinion poll showing that the party has gained more supporters than the ruling Democratic Party (UFP: 36.5%\u2013DP: 33.4%). This was the first time that a conservative party gained more support than a liberal party since the political scandal of former President Park Geun-hye in October 2016.\nOn 31 August, the party decided to change its name to the People Power (&lt;a href=\"Korean%20language\"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt;: \uad6d\ubbfc\uc758\ud798; the \"Party\" was added later). The party requested that the name be changed to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Election%20Commission%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;National Election Commission&lt;/a&gt;. It has been argued that the new proposed name was similar to the minor centrist &lt;a href=\"People%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;People Party&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%20Cheol-soo\"&gt;Ahn Cheol-soo&lt;/a&gt;. There are speculations that the party is willing to form an electoral alliance with the minor opposition party in the 2021 by-elections. &lt;a href=\"Jung%20Chung-rae\"&gt;Jung Chung-rae&lt;/a&gt;, an MP of the Democratic Party, criticised the name for being too similar to a civic organisation established in 2003, where he used to serve as its first co-president.\nOn 2 September, the party officially changed its name to the People Power Party, its current name. The PPP declared that it would be a centrist and &lt;a href=\"pragmatism\"&gt;pragmatic&lt;/a&gt; party. On 14 September, the party revealed its logo and its 3 colours\u2014red, yellow, and blue, based on its temporary decisions. These colours were officially confirmed on 23 September, although yellow was replaced with white.\nOn 17 September, &lt;a href=\"Kwon%20Sung-dong\"&gt;Kwon Sung-dong&lt;/a&gt;, the MP for &lt;a href=\"Gangneung\"&gt;Gangneung&lt;/a&gt;, officially returned to the PPP, leading the party to have 104 seats. He left the party before the 2020 elections, where he ran as an independent candidate. The PPP's total seats were reverted to 103 after &lt;a href=\"Park%20Duk-hyum\"&gt;Park Duk-hyum&lt;/a&gt;, the MP for &lt;a href=\"Boeun%20County\"&gt;Boeun&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Okcheon%20County\"&gt;Okcheon&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Yeongdong%20County\"&gt;Yeongdong&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Goesan%20County\"&gt;Goesan&lt;/a&gt;, quit the party on 23 September following corruption allegations. He denied all allegations related to him and his family.\nOn 22 December, &lt;a href=\"Jeon%20Bong-min\"&gt;Jeon Bong-min&lt;/a&gt;, the MP for &lt;a href=\"Suyeong%20District\"&gt;Suyeong&lt;/a&gt;, quit the party following corruption allegations against himself and his father.\nOn 7 January 2021, &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Byong-wook\"&gt;Kim Byong-wook&lt;/a&gt;, the MP for &lt;a href=\"South%20District%20%28Pohang%29\"&gt;Pohang South&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Ulleung%20County\"&gt;Ulleung&lt;/a&gt;, withdrew from the PPP due to a controversy related to &lt;a href=\"sexual%20harassment\"&gt;sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt;. The same day, &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Tae-ho%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Kim Tae-ho&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20South%20Gyeongsang%20Province\"&gt;Governor of South Gyeongsang&lt;/a&gt; and the incumbent MP for &lt;a href=\"Sancheong%20County\"&gt;Sancheong&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Hamyang%20County\"&gt;Hamyang&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Geochang%20County\"&gt;Geochang&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Hapcheon%20County\"&gt;Hapcheon&lt;/a&gt;, officially rejoined the party.\n2021 by-elections.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"2021%20South%20Korean%20by-elections\"&gt;2021 by-elections&lt;/a&gt;, the party elected the former &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Seoul\"&gt;Mayor of Seoul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oh%20Se-hoon\"&gt;Oh Se-hoon&lt;/a&gt; as its &lt;a href=\"Seoul\"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt; mayoral candidate, as well as the former MP for Suyeong, &lt;a href=\"Park%20Hyung-joon\"&gt;Park Hyung-joon&lt;/a&gt; as its &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Busan\"&gt;mayoral&lt;/a&gt; candidate on 4 March 2021.\nIn the by-elections on 7 April, the party achieved an outright victory despite the government's low popularity, where both Oh and Park were elected by a large margin. Oh Se-hoon, who formerly stepped down as the Mayor of Seoul in 2011, defeated the Democratic candidate &lt;a href=\"Park%20Young-sun\"&gt;Park Young-sun&lt;/a&gt; and successfully came back to the position. Park Hyung-joon also defeated the Democratic candidate &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Young-choon\"&gt;Kim Young-choon&lt;/a&gt; and was elected the Mayor of Busan, despite his several controversies, such as &lt;a href=\"Haeundae%20LCT%20The%20Sharp\"&gt;Haeundae LCT The Sharp&lt;/a&gt;. The same day, the MP for &lt;a href=\"Gimcheon\"&gt;Gimcheon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Song%20Eon-seog\"&gt;Song Eon-seog&lt;/a&gt;, faced public backlashes after it was reported that he was swearing and assaulting office workers. He quit the party on 14 April.\nSince 2021.\nOn 8 April 2021, Joo Ho-young returned as the interim President of the party. He announced his intention to resign as the parliamentary leader on 16 April, adding that he would not serve until his term finishes on 29 May, but instead, until a new person is elected. The same day, the party declared that they will continue the processes to merge the minor People Party.\nOn 30 April, the former &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Ulsan\"&gt;Mayor of Ulsan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Gi-hyeon\"&gt;Kim Gi-hyeon&lt;/a&gt; was elected the new parliamentary leader of the party, defeating &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Tae-heum\"&gt;Kim Tae-heum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kweon%20Seong-dong\"&gt;Kweon Seong-dong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Eui-dong\"&gt;Yu Eui-dong&lt;/a&gt;. He served as the acting party President until the &lt;a href=\"2021%20People%20Power%20Party%20leadership%20election\"&gt;leadership election&lt;/a&gt; that was held on 11 June.\nOn 21 May, Kim Byong-wook, who quit the party in January following a sexual harassment controversy, officially returned to the PPP.\nOn 11 June, &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Jun-seok\"&gt;Lee Jun-seok&lt;/a&gt; was elected the new President of the party, defeating &lt;a href=\"Na%20Kyung-won\"&gt;Na Kyung-won&lt;/a&gt; and others.\nOn 24 June, the party approved an independent MP &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Jun-pyo\"&gt;Hong Jun-pyo&lt;/a&gt;'s bid to rejoin. Among the 4 independent MPs who had quit the party before the 2020 elections, &lt;a href=\"Yoon%20Sang-hyun%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Yoon Sang-hyun&lt;/a&gt; became the sole MP who has not returned to the party yet.\nOn 15 July, &lt;a href=\"Choi%20Jae-hyung\"&gt;Choi Jae-hyung&lt;/a&gt;, one of the potential candidate for the &lt;a href=\"2022%20South%20Korean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2022 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, officially joined the party.\nOn 30 July, the former &lt;a href=\"Prosecutor%20General%20of%20South%20Korea\"&gt;Prosecutor General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yoon%20Seok-youl\"&gt;Yoon Seok-youl&lt;/a&gt;, who is also the most favourable candidate for the 2020 presidential election, officially joined the party.\nPolitical positions.\nEconomic policies.\nIn the past, conservative political parties in South Korea also showed &lt;a href=\"economic%20interventionism\"&gt;economic interventionism&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href=\"Park%20Chung-hee\"&gt;Park Chung-hee&lt;/a&gt;'s influence. However, the current PPP has become more economically liberal, and the British journal &lt;a href=\"The%20Economist\"&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt; described PPP as \"&lt;a href=\"fiscal%20conservatism\"&gt;fiscal conservative&lt;/a&gt;\" in 'The World Head 2022'.\nSocial policies.\nThe PPP has a &lt;a href=\"social%20conservatism\"&gt;socially conservative&lt;/a&gt; tendency and advocates sound budgeting, public safety, a focus on providing jobs, traditional family values, and national patriotism. Most PPP politicians oppose &lt;a href=\"LGBT%20rights\"&gt;LGBT rights&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Oh%20Se-hoon\"&gt;Oh Se-hoon&lt;/a&gt; and other politicians, known as &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20conservatism\"&gt;moderate conservatives&lt;/a&gt;, are also opposed to homosexuality. The party is strongly opposed to the comprehensive anti-discrimination law, which includes sexual minorities, saying it reverse discriminates against women.\nSome media outlets criticized PPP's negative attitude toward &lt;a href=\"feminism\"&gt;feminism&lt;/a&gt;.\nPPP opposes &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;DPK&lt;/a&gt;'s liberal policy of officially attempting to regulate &lt;a href=\"dog%20meat\"&gt;dog meat&lt;/a&gt; consumption. Yang Joon-woo, a spokesman for PPP, criticized, \"The state does not have the right to regulate individual tastes or eating habits\"."
