It surmounts &lt;a href=\"Pleystor%20Glacier\"&gt;Pleystor Glacier&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest.\nThe peak was shown on an Argentine government chart of 1950, but was named by the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Antarctic%20Place-Names%20Committee\"&gt;United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee&lt;/a&gt; (UK-APC) in 1960 for Vesalius (1514\u20131564), a Flemish anatomist who wrote a pioneer work on the structure of the human body which revolutionized the whole concept of the subject."
