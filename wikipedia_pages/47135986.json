    "text": "Al Kharrara (; also spelled Al Harrarah) is a village in &lt;a href=\"Qatar\"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"municipalities%20of%20Qatar\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Al%20Wakrah%20%28municipality%29\"&gt;Al Wakrah&lt;/a&gt;. The closest sizable city is &lt;a href=\"Mesaieed\"&gt;Mesaieed&lt;/a&gt;, located to the east. It is a desert area, characterized by high aridity and the presence of grazing animals such as &lt;a href=\"Dromedary\"&gt;dromedary camels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThe village's name comes from the &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20language\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; \"khar\", which roughly means \"the sound of running water\". As the area consists of varying elevations and several hills, the process of &lt;a href=\"surface%20runoff\"&gt;surface runoff&lt;/a&gt; is very noticeable during the wet months.\nGeography.\nAl Kharrara is situated in south-central Qatar. The villages of &lt;a href=\"Al%20Aamriya\"&gt;Al Aamriya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Umm%20Hawta\"&gt;Umm Hawta&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Al%20Rayyan\"&gt;Al Rayyan&lt;/a&gt; Municipality are nearby to the west.\nHistory.\nAccording to Richard H. Curtiss of the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Report%20on%20Middle%20East%20Affairs\"&gt;Washington Report&lt;/a&gt;, inscriptions dedicated to the pre-Islamic &lt;a href=\"Nabataeans\"&gt;Nabataean&lt;/a&gt; god &lt;a href=\"Manat%20%28goddess%29\"&gt;Man\u0101t&lt;/a&gt; were found in Al Kharrara.\nIn &lt;a href=\"John%20Gordon%20Lorimer%20%281870-1914%29\"&gt;J.G. Lorimer&lt;/a&gt;'s 1908 publication \"&lt;a href=\"Gazetteer%20of%20the%20Persian%20Gulf%2C%20Oman%20and%20Central%20Arabia\"&gt;Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt;\", he refers Al Kharrara as a &lt;a href=\"Bedouin\"&gt;Bedouin&lt;/a&gt; outpost that lies \"20 miles south of &lt;a href=\"Doha\"&gt;Doha&lt;/a&gt;h and 6 from the east coast, between Naqiy\u0101n and Jabalat-at-Tuwar\". He noted the presence of a masonry well, 27 fathoms deep, containing good water.\nIndustry.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Qatar%20Primary%20Materials%20Company\"&gt;Qatar Primary Materials Company&lt;/a&gt; has centered its dune sand extraction operations here due to the area's relatively large deposits.\nSports.\nThe second stage of the Sealine Cross-Country Rally, which runs for 345.89 km, starts in Al Kharrara and ends in &lt;a href=\"Mesaieed\"&gt;Sealine Beach&lt;/a&gt; (a section of Mesaieed)."
