    "text": "The Revolutionary Communist Party of India ( RCPI) is a small political party in India. The party was founded as the Communist League by &lt;a href=\"Saumyendranath%20Tagore\"&gt;Saumyendranath Tagore&lt;/a&gt; in 1934, breaking away from the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India\"&gt;Communist Party of India&lt;/a&gt; (CPI). RCPI led armed uprisings after the &lt;a href=\"independence%20of%20India\"&gt;independence of India&lt;/a&gt;, but later shifted to parliamentary politics. The party is active in the Kerala, &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt;. The party was represented in the West Bengal while being a part of &lt;a href=\"Second%20United%20Front%20Cabinet\"&gt;Second United Front Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; (1969) as well as in various state government during the &lt;a href=\"Left%20Front%20%28West%20Bengal%29\"&gt;Left Front&lt;/a&gt; rule in the state (1977\u20132011). In Assam the party won four Legislative Assembly seats in 1978, but its political influence has since declined in the state.\nIdeology.\nThe RCPI works toward a socialist revolution, rather than a &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20democracy%20%28Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism%29\"&gt;people's democratic revolution&lt;/a&gt;, a national democratic revolution or a &lt;a href=\"New%20Democracy\"&gt;new democratic revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party strives to build socialism under the leadership of the proletariat with active cooperation of other exploited strata of the humanity, including peasants, working intellectuals and non-manual working sections of people.\nCommunist League.\nS.N. Tagore founded the Communist League on 1 August 1934. Tagore was a communist leader from &lt;a href=\"Bengal\"&gt;Bengal&lt;/a&gt; who had attended the 1928 Sixth Congress of the Communist International, and had stayed in Europe for seven years afterwards. He toured the continent on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"League%20Against%20Imperialism\"&gt;League Against Imperialism&lt;/a&gt;. At the 1928 Communist International congress Tagore had sought to challenge the role of &lt;a href=\"M.N.%20Roy\"&gt;M.N. Roy&lt;/a&gt; in the organization. Tagore had turned hostile towards Stalin, possibly as in reaction to his failed bid to gain recognition from the Communist International in 1928. On his return to India in 1934 he appealed to CPI to abandon its ultra-left line. Albeit CPI would later moderate its positions after the Seventh Congress of the Communist International, Tagore broke with CPI and founded his own communist group (the Communist League). In May 1934 Tagore set up an 'initiative committee' for the founding of the new party. Other founders of the Communist League included Sudhir Dasgupta, Prabhat Sen, Ranjit Majumdar and Arun Banerjee.\nTagore denounced the &lt;a href=\"Popular%20Front\"&gt;Popular Front&lt;/a&gt; line of CPI, rejecting the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Congress Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;. In Tagore's view the CSP represented an alliance between socialists and reactionary elements of the bourgeoise.\nCommunist League and the peasantry.\nAfter the formation of the Communist League Tagore began touring the Bengal country-side, organizing peasants to struggle for abolishing the \"&lt;a href=\"zamindar\"&gt;zamindar&lt;/a&gt;i\" system. In early 1938 Tagore built a peasants wing, the Bangiyo Pradeshik Kisan Sabha, separate from the CPI-led &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Kisan%20Sabha\"&gt;Krishak Samiti&lt;/a&gt;. Tagore's BPKS demanded abolition of the zamindari system without giving any compensation to landlords, free distribution of land among the cultivators and agricultural labourers, minimization of revenue demands and cancellation of debts to moneylenders.\nCommunist League in Murshidabad.\nTarapada Gupta set up the Communist League branch in Murshidabad in 1936, raising the &lt;a href=\"red%20flag%20%28politics%29\"&gt;red flag&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in recorded history in the district. Tarapada Gupta had been released from jail in 1935, and he established contact with Tagore's group. The Communist League preceded both the CPI and the RSP in Murshidabad. The party successfully organized peasants to refuse to pay rents to landlords in the area. Gupta would later side with Tagore in the 1948 party split.\nTagore in Assam.\nRCPI was the first left organization to established itself in Assam. RCPI built a student movement in Assam. In 1937 a Radical Club was formed at &lt;a href=\"Cotton%20College%2C%20Guwahati\"&gt;Cotton College&lt;/a&gt;, under the cover of the and with Haren Kalita as its leader. In November 1938 Tagore visited &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt; and met with a group of students and youth. His visit was organized by the Congressman Debranath Sarma. A Communist League branch was formed in the province in 1939, with several of the Cotton College students as its members. Students who became members of the Communist League included Haren Kalita, Haridas Deka, Tarunsen Deka, Upen Sarma, Ananda Chandra Das, Taracharan Majumdar, Gokul Medhi, Arabinda Ghosh, Loknath Barua, Umakanta Sarma, Bhupen Mahanta, N. Buragohain, Khagendranath Barbarua, Uma Sarma and Kamini Goswami. The students would later contest, and eventually win, the Cotton College Students Union through the Assam Provincial Students Federation. \nTagore made a second visit to Assam in December 1941. This time he visited Khagen Barbarua at his village in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Assam\"&gt;Upper Assam&lt;/a&gt; and discussed building the party organization in the province. Tagore was expelled from Assam on 18 December 1941. The Assam Provincial Student Federation, which was under the influence of RCPI supported the Quit India movement.\nOn 2 May 1940 the &lt;a href=\"Krishak%20Banuva%20Panchayat\"&gt;Krishak Banuva Panchayat&lt;/a&gt; was formed in &lt;a href=\"Gauhati\"&gt;Gauhati&lt;/a&gt; as the open front group of the party in Assam. Kedarnath Goswami was the first president of KBP, a former Congressman and labour organizer. The basic unit of KBP was the Gaon Krishak Panchayat ('Village Peasants Council'). The Assamese folk singer &lt;a href=\"Bishnu%20Prasad%20Rabha\"&gt;Bishnu Prasad Rabha&lt;/a&gt; joined KBP in 1945. In 1949 he became a RCPI member.\nAs the Indian National Congress dominated the tea gardens of Assam and there was little industrial labour in the province, the Communist League instead sought to organize rice mill workers, horse cart drivers and steamboat labourers. The efforts had meagre results. Notably RCPI made no intents to build the party in the hill areas of &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt;.\nRCPI and the World War.\nThe party was organized along &lt;a href=\"Leninist\"&gt;Leninist&lt;/a&gt; lines with party cells at the bottom of the party hierarchy and the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee\"&gt;Central Committee&lt;/a&gt; as its leadership. In preparation of the impending World War, the party developed a three-tier leadership structure in order for the party to survive under waves of repression. The third tier was entirely clandestine, prepared to take over the party affairs after arrests of the first two tiers.\nThe party raised the slogan \"Not one &lt;a href=\"paisa\"&gt;paisa&lt;/a&gt;, not one man for war\". On 4 September 1939 Tagore issued a declaration, labelling the war as an imperialist conflict and called on the Indian workers to turn the imperialist war into civil war. Tagore was arrested and jailed under the &lt;a href=\"Defence%20of%20India%20Act%2C%201939\"&gt;Defence of India Act&lt;/a&gt; immediately afterwards. With Tagore in jail, Pannalal Dasgupta became general secretary of the party. He toured Assam, &lt;a href=\"Bombay\"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madras\"&gt;Madras&lt;/a&gt; and Bengal. During the Second World War, peasants influenced by the party were instructed not to sell rice for exportation.\nIn 1941 the Third Party Conference of the Communist League of India changed its name to Communist Party of India (not to be confused with its far more well-known namesake). In March 1943 the name RCPI was adopted, in order to differentiate itself from the CPI. The party positioned itself claiming to be the sole true leftist party in the country, denouncing all other left forces as ideologically bankrupt. Overall RCPI avoided collaboration with other left-wing groups. RCPI labour organizing was done largely outside the &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Trade%20Union%20Congress\"&gt;All India Trade Union Congress&lt;/a&gt;. It managed to build a core of political cadres and was active building a labour movement amongst workers at the jute mills in the Beliaghata-Narkeldanga area of Calcutta. The party was often referred to as the 'Tagorites' or as the '\"Ganavani\" group' (after the name of its publication).\nRCPI differed with CPI on tactical questions during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;. RCPI denounced the &lt;a href=\"Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact\"&gt;Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact&lt;/a&gt; as well as declaring the Soviet war with &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; as 'imperialist'.\nThe RCPI fully supported the &lt;a href=\"Quit%20India%20movement\"&gt;Quit India movement&lt;/a&gt;. The party sought to develop the Quit India movement into a revolutionary upheaval. Most of the known party leaders were arrested, and would remain in detention until the end of the Second World War. Through the Radical Institute, RCPI promoted dissemination of locally produced weaponry to use against British government forces in Assam.\nIn the \"Red Front\", in October 1942, &lt;a href=\"Saumyendranath%20Tagore\"&gt;Saumyendranath Tagore&lt;/a&gt; wrote:\nThe conclusions that we draw from the Quit India movement are the following:\nFirst, the utter bankruptcy of the Congress, the party of the Indian bourgeoisie and its total inability to lead the national movement.\nSecondly, the complete overthrow of non-violence as a technique of struggle.\nThirdly, the complete exposure of the National Frontists, the legal Communists, the germ-carriers of anti-revolutionary Stalinism.\nFourthly, the rapid revolutionisation of the masses.\nFifthly, the ripening of the ideological premises for the growth of real leftism as a result of the political development, both national and international.\nThe national revolution in India has definitely jumped over the hurdles of Gandhism and has scornfully rejected the petty bourgeois Congress Socialism which is at the service of the Indian bourgeoisie.\nIt has thoroughly exposed the legal communist traitors of the Stalinist and the Royist brand. Only the political line of the Revolutionary Communist Party stands fully vindicated by the development and march of the national revolutionary movement.\nIn 1945 RCPI raised two key slogans in Assam, 'land to the tiller' (\"nangal jar mati tar\") and 'one third share' (\"tin bhag\"), slogans which became very popular amongst landless peasants and agricultural labourers. KBP was able to make some inroads amongst these sectors.\nSome Tribal League leaders in Assam, such as Aniram Basumatari and Daben Khaklari, became RCPI members in the mid-1940s. Their presence in the party helped it to make inroads amongst the tribals in Assam.\nIndependence and Partition.\nAs the departure of British colonial rule came closer, RCPI denounced the negotiated independence as a joint conspiracy between British imperialism and the Indian bourgeoisie. RCPI stated that Independence obtained in 1947 was a false one. Rejecting the official process for independence, RCPI began organizing \"&lt;a href=\"panchayat\"&gt;panchayat&lt;/a&gt;s\" (i.e. &lt;a href=\"soviet\"&gt;soviet&lt;/a&gt;s) of workers and peasants in order to convene a Workers and Peasants Constituent Assembly. RCPI denounced the &lt;a href=\"Partition%20of%20India\"&gt;Partition of India&lt;/a&gt; as betrayal and surrender to British imperialism. There was a strong Hindu chauvinist trend within RCPI, as alleged by Charles W. Ervin. RCPI opposed the &lt;a href=\"1946%20Cabinet%20Mission%20to%20India\"&gt;1946 Cabinet Mission to India&lt;/a&gt;, which wanted to place Assam into the Muslim-majority grouping of provinces. According to Salkia, through its opposition to the Cabinet Mission grouping RCPI was able to carve out \"a niche for itself in the mainstream politics of Assam\".\nIn 1946 RCPI discussed a possible merger with the &lt;a href=\"Bolshevik-Leninist%20Party%20of%20India%2C%20Ceylon%20and%20Burma\"&gt;Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma&lt;/a&gt;. The RCPI delegation in the talks consisted of Sudhir Dasgupta, Tarapada Gupta, and Gour Pal. Nevertheless, the merger discussion didn't go through. RCPI refused to join the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20International\"&gt;Fourth International&lt;/a&gt;. The BLPI discarded the RCPI line of organizing \"soviets\" as a premature move.\nIn September 1947 RCPI and BLPI collaborated to build a United Workers Front to challenge the Congress-led trade unions. In December 1947 Tagore was elected president of the All India Bank Employees Association, at its conference held in &lt;a href=\"Lucknow\"&gt;Lucknow&lt;/a&gt;.\nTagore\u2013Dasgupta split.\nTagore was jailed in November 1947. Tagore was released from prison in 1948. After his release from jail Tagore argued that armed revolution was premature in India. But a sector of the party, led by Pannalal Dasgupta, insisted on turning the campaign of building panchayats into a general armed insurrection.\nDasgupta assembled an All India Party Conference in &lt;a href=\"Birbhum\"&gt;Birbhum&lt;/a&gt; in 1948. Tagore requested to resign from the RCPI Central Committee, a request the Birbhum conference rejected. After the Birbhum conference the followers of Dasgupta began to gather arms and prepare for armed struggle. The developments inside RCPI had an echo in the CPI. Dasgupta's view that India was ripe for armed revolution coincided with the position of the new CPI leader &lt;a href=\"B.T.%20Ranadive\"&gt;B.T. Ranadive&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Birbhum conference Tagore, at a public meeting in &lt;a href=\"Calcutta\"&gt;Calcutta&lt;/a&gt;, denounced insurrectional line of Dasgupta. Tagore's speech pushed the Dasgupta group to issue disciplinary action against him, accepting his resignation from the Central Committee. Half a year later Tagore gathered his followers for a separate Party Conference, as its 5th Party Congress, in &lt;a href=\"Burdwan\"&gt;Burdwan&lt;/a&gt;. Thus there were two parallel RCPIs, one led by Dasgupta and one led by Tagore. Dasgupta represented the majority group in the split. It was sometimes known as 'RCPI (Rebel Group)' or as 'RCPI (Dasgupta)'. The Tagore-led party was known as '&lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Tagore%29\"&gt;RCPI (Tagore)&lt;/a&gt;'.\n26 February 1949 attacks.\nOn 26 February 1949 the Dasgupta-led RCPI initiated its armed revolt. They attacked the &lt;a href=\"Dum%20Dum%20Airfield\"&gt;Dum Dum Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jessop%20%26amp%3B%20Company\"&gt;Jessop &amp; Company&lt;/a&gt; and the Dum Dum Gun and Shell Factory. At the Jessop plant equipment was stolen. Several persons were killed or injured in the attacks. At the Dum Dum Gun and Shell Factory the sentry was shot. The British manager at Jessup was thrown into a furnace, as were two other Europeans. Another European was stabbed, and later died. At Dum Dum Airfield a plane was set on fire and seven rifles stolen. The militants then moved towards &lt;a href=\"Basirhat\"&gt;Basirhat&lt;/a&gt;. On Jessore Road they attacked the Gouripour Police Post. At Basirhat they attacked a police station, killing two guards and stealing 26 rifles. The militants attempted to flee into &lt;a href=\"East%20Pakistan\"&gt;East Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually the group was caught as police reinforcements arrived from Calcutta. A police inspector was killed during the gun fight. Only two of the attackers managed to escape arrest. 39 RCPI cadres were arrested, including Dasgupta himself. They were held without trial for 4\u20135 years, and then sentenced to jail. Dasgupta himself was sentenced to imprisonment for life.\nAfter the 1949 revolt, the party cast away its line of insurrectional politics. Whilst RCPI acted from underground, no formal ban was placed on the party.\nAssam insurgency.\nThe Assam branch of RCPI sided with Dasgupta in the 1948 split. In the wake of Independence, RCPI and CPI initiated mass peasant unrest in Assam. In the wake of the Dum Dum-Basirhat attacks, the party decided to launch an armed movement for the independence of Assam from India. The party held a conference in Khowang, Dibrugarh, at which is decided to build a 'People's Army' as an armed mass front of the party. RCPI-led uprisings in Assam took place between 1948 and 1952. Khagen Barbarua led the movement in the non-tribal areas in Upper Assam. The party raised the battle cry 'land belongs to the one who wields a plough, the jungle belongs to one who wields an axe', calling for ownership rights for sharecroppers. The Assam government placed a ban on the party, citing the pretext that RCPI organized peasants to cease payments to landlords and supported illegal felling of trees.\nIn early 1950 RCPI killed Ganga Sarma, a local Indian National Congress leader in Assam, during a meeting. According to the government of Assam, RCPI committed 12 assassinations in the state in 1950. RCPI financed its rebellion in Assam through robberies and extortion. The government responded by cracking down on RCPI in Assam. The government responded by cracking down on RCPI in Assam. As a symbolic protest against the state violence, RCPI cadres tore down the national flag at different places in the state. In the wake of state repression against RCPI, the party lost influence amongst the sharecroppers in Assam.\nIn the wake of state repression against RCPI, the party lost influence amongst the sharecroppers in Assam. In Assam RCPI and CPI were at loggerheads, especially around the issue of the Soviet Union (RCPI accusing CPI of being controlled by the Soviets, CPI accusing RCPI of being anti-Soviet). RCPI-CPI relations reached its lowest point in 1952.\nWork amongst refugees.\nRCPI had a mass organization, the Bastuhara Kalyan Parishad, which organized relief activities in camps of refugees from East Pakistan. The party also had a separate refugee women's organization, Bangiya Dal Seba Sangathan. RCPI concentrated its work amongst refugees in &lt;a href=\"Nadia%20district\"&gt;Nadia district&lt;/a&gt;. In 1948\u20131949 the RCPI and the &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Forward%20Bloc\"&gt;All India Forward Bloc&lt;/a&gt; dominated the Chandmari and Goshala refugee camps in Nadia district. Prabhat Mukherjee and Amalendu Neogi were key RCPI leaders at Chandmari camp. At Goshala the RCPI cadre Arun Banerjee organized refugee youth into revolutionary politics. The party joined the United Central Refugee Council in August 1950. RCPI(Rebel) in UCRC and ULF. In October 1950 RCPI forcefully took control of 175 &lt;a href=\"bigha\"&gt;bigha&lt;/a&gt;s near &lt;a href=\"Gayeshpur\"&gt;Gayeshpur&lt;/a&gt; Colony and redistributed the land amongst 350 refugee families.\nFirst General Election.\nThe party boycotted the 1951\u20131952 elections. In October 1952, the Assam government withdrew the ban on the RCPI.\nUnion activism.\nRCPI was active within the &lt;a href=\"United%20Trade%20Union%20Congress\"&gt;United Trade Union Congress&lt;/a&gt;, but opposed RSP domination of UTUC.\nRCPI in Bihar.\nRCPI never gained any prominence in &lt;a href=\"Bihar\"&gt;Bihar&lt;/a&gt;. The influence of the party solely included a few trade unions in &lt;a href=\"Chhotanagpur\"&gt;Chhotanagpur&lt;/a&gt;. One union influenced by RCPI was the Hindustan Khan Mazdoor Sangh, a coal miners' union.\nRCPI in Bombay.\n&lt;a href=\"Krishna%20Desai\"&gt;Krishna Desai&lt;/a&gt;, a textile worker from Bombay, joined RCPI in 1947. He was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Bombay%20Municipal%20Corporation\"&gt;Bombay Municipal Corporation&lt;/a&gt; at numerous times as a RCPI candidate. Desai joined CPI ahead of the 1967 state assembly election.\nDesai had sought refugee in Calcutta, as he was on the run after his role in communal violence. The stayed with the RCPI there and when he returned to Bombay he founded a RCPI branch there. Another labour organizer of RCPI in Bombay was K.L. Bajaj, who became a RCPI member after a visit to Calcutta in the early 1950s. He joined CPI(M) in 1964 and later became vice president of the &lt;a href=\"Centre%20of%20Indian%20Trade%20Unions\"&gt;Centre of Indian Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt;.\nRCPI took part in the &lt;a href=\"Samyukta%20Maharashtra\"&gt;Samyukta Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt; struggle of the 1950s.\n1957 elections.\nThe party fielded 5 candidates in the &lt;a href=\"1957%20West%20Bengal%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;1957 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election&lt;/a&gt;.\nKhagen Barbarua of RCPI was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Assam%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Assam Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1957%20Assam%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;1957 Assam Legislative Assembly election&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Amguri%20%28Vidhan%20Sabha%20constituency%29\"&gt;Amguri constituency&lt;/a&gt;.\n1960 Party Congress.\nThe party held an All India Party Conference in Howrah in 1960. At the Howrah conference the &lt;a href=\"Trotskyist\"&gt;Trotskyist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Workers%20Party%20%28India%29\"&gt;Revolutionary Workers Party&lt;/a&gt; merged into the RCPI. Moreover, Howrah conference elected &lt;a href=\"Sudhindranath%20Kumar\"&gt;Sudhindranath Kumar&lt;/a&gt; as new general secretary of the party. Kumar had joined the party in 1936. As per an agreement between RWP and RCPI, the Trotskyists were given five seats in the RCPI Central Committee.\n1962 elections.\nAhead of the &lt;a href=\"1962%20West%20Bengal%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;1962 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election&lt;/a&gt; RCPI joined the CPI-led &lt;a href=\"United%20Left%20Front%20%281962%29\"&gt;United Left Front&lt;/a&gt;. Two RCPI candidates were elected; &lt;a href=\"Anadi%20Das\"&gt;Anadi Das&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Howrah%20West%20%28Vidhan%20Sabha%20constituency%29\"&gt;Howrah West&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kanai%20Pal\"&gt;Kanai Pal&lt;/a&gt; (ex-RWP) from &lt;a href=\"Santipur%20%28Vidhan%20Sabha%20constituency%29\"&gt;Santipur&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Assam RCPI stayed out of the United Opposition Front set up by the &lt;a href=\"Praja%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Praja Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; and independents. Khagen Barbarua retained the Amguri seat in the &lt;a href=\"1962%20Assam%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;1962 Assam Legislative Assembly election&lt;/a&gt;. RCPI had fielded 16 candidates in the election.\n1962 Indo-China war.\nWhen Dasgupta returned after his release from jail, the relations with the former RWP cadres deteriorated. Dasgupta had evolved into a Nehru supporter. In the &lt;a href=\"Indo-China%20war%20of%201962\"&gt;Indo-China war of 1962&lt;/a&gt; RCPI supported the Nehru government, a move the Trotskyists opposed. As a result of the dispute over the Indo-China war, the Trotskyists broke with RCPI in 1963. Dasgupta himself parted ways with RCPI, moving towards a &lt;a href=\"Gandhi\"&gt;Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;an position.\n1967 elections.\nKumar served as convenor of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Front%20%281967%29\"&gt;United Front&lt;/a&gt; formed ahead of the &lt;a href=\"1967%20West%20Bengal%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;1967 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election&lt;/a&gt;. Anadi Das lost his assembly seat in the election. During the protests against the dismissal of the first &lt;a href=\"United%20Front%20%281967%29\"&gt;United Front&lt;/a&gt; cabinet in 1967, Kumar was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act.\nRCPI won 3 seats in the first Howrah Municipal Corporation polls, held in 1967.\nMd. Shamsul Huda of RCPI won the &lt;a href=\"Dhing%20%28Vidhan%20Sabha%20constituency%29\"&gt;Dhing seat&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1967%20Assam%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;1967 Assam Legislative Assembly election&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Second United Front government.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"1969%20West%20Bengal%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;1969 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election&lt;/a&gt; Kumar was named Food and Supplies Minister in the second United Front state government. The Food Minister had been given to the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%29\"&gt;Communist Party of India (Marxist)&lt;/a&gt; in the coalition government, but CPI(M) opted to name Kumar as its choice for the post.\nThe RCPI won two seats in the &lt;a href=\"1969%20West%20Bengal%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;1969 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election&lt;/a&gt;. Kumar was named convenor of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Front%20%281967%29\"&gt;United Front&lt;/a&gt; as well as being named Food Minister in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20United%20Front%20Cabinet\"&gt;Second United Front Cabinet&lt;/a&gt;. After Kumar's entry into the West Bengal state cabinet, the two RCPI legislators, Anadi Das and &lt;a href=\"M.%20Mokshed%20Ali\"&gt;M. Mokshed Ali&lt;/a&gt;, revolted against Kumar's leadership. In July 1969 the two legislators were expelled from RCPI, accused of \"anti-Party and anti-&lt;a href=\"United%20Front%20%28West%20Bengal%29\"&gt;UF&lt;/a&gt; activities\". The expulsion provoked a split in RCPI, with Anadi Das leading &lt;a href=\"Revolutionary%20Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Das%29\"&gt;his own RCPI faction&lt;/a&gt;.\n1970s.\nAfter the fall of the United Front cabinet, the RCPI joined the CPI(M)-led United Left Front. The front, which was formally constituted in May 1970, had Kumar as its convenor. In the &lt;a href=\"1971%20West%20Bengal%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;1971 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election&lt;/a&gt; RCPI won three seats; &lt;a href=\"Bimalananda%20Mukherjee\"&gt;Bimalananda Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; in Santipur, Sudhindranath Kumar in &lt;a href=\"Howrah%20Madhya%20%28Vidhan%20Sabha%20constituency%29\"&gt;Howrah Central&lt;/a&gt; and Trilochan Mal in &lt;a href=\"Hansan%20%28Vidhan%20Sabha%20constituency%29\"&gt;Hansan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1971%20Indian%20general%20election\"&gt;1971 Indian general election&lt;/a&gt; RCPI and CPI(M) had an electoral understanding in Assam.
