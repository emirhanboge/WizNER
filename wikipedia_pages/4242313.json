From October, the first military recruitment began to train. After an accelerated graduation from the school in the summer of 1942, Varennikov was among the few graduates to be appointed the commander of a training platoon in the reserve rifle brigade stationed in &lt;a href=\"Nizhny%20Novgorod\"&gt;Gorky&lt;/a&gt;, and only in October 1942 he ended up on the &lt;a href=\"Stalingrad%20Front\"&gt;Stalingrad Front&lt;/a&gt; as commander of a &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt; platoon of 120-mm regimental mortars of the &lt;a href=\"138th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29\"&gt;138th Rifle Division&lt;/a&gt;.

In June 1945, he took part in the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Victory%20Parade%20of%201945\"&gt;Moscow Victory Parade of 1945&lt;/a&gt; and immediately before the parade, being the chief of the guard of honor, he received the &lt;a href=\"Victory%20Banner\"&gt;Victory Banner&lt;/a&gt;. He ended the war with the rank of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost war career.\nVarennikov stayed in &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt; as an officer of the Soviet troops, stationed there until 1950.\nIn 1954 he graduated from the &lt;a href=\"Frunze%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;Frunze Military Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.

From 1962 to 1966 Varennikov commanded the &lt;a href=\"54th%20Motor%20Rifle%20Division\"&gt;54th Motor Rifle Division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Leningrad%20Military%20District\"&gt;Leningrad Military District&lt;/a&gt;. In 1964 armed forces inspectors tested the division, and it was awarded as one of the six top divisions of the Ground Forces of the USSR Armed Forces by order of the Minister of Defence. In August 1965 he was enrolled in the &lt;a href=\"General%20Staff%20Academy%20%28Soviet%29\"&gt;General Staff Academy&lt;/a&gt;.

On 1973, he became the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Carpathian%20Military%20District\"&gt;Carpathian Military District&lt;/a&gt;. \nFrom 1979 to 1984, he served as the Head of the Main Operations Directorate and First Deputy Chief of the &lt;a href=\"General%20Staff%20of%20the%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation\"&gt;General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR&lt;/a&gt;. \nBetween 1984 and 1985, Varennikov worked with the Soviet military mission in &lt;a href=\"Angola\"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;, then in the throes of a bloody &lt;a href=\"Angolan%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;. In a sharp contrast with the official policy of only permitting Soviet military advisers to serve in non-combat roles, Varennikov supported allowing the advisers to fight alongside their Angolan allies in the event they came under attack. He was the senior Soviet general officer in Angola during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Askari\"&gt;Operation Askari&lt;/a&gt;, and personally advised Angolan President &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Eduardo%20dos%20Santos\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos&lt;/a&gt; on defensive measures to counter the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Defence%20Force\"&gt;South African Defence Force&lt;/a&gt;'s incursion.

Varennikov continued to defend the war even after the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20withdrawal%20from%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Soviet withdrawal&lt;/a&gt; in 1989. \nIn 1989 General Varennikov was named Commander-in-chief of Ground Forces and Deputy Minister of Defence.\nInvolvement in the August Coup.\nIn 1991, during the &lt;a href=\"1991%20Soviet%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempt\"&gt;August coup attempt&lt;/a&gt; he joined forces opposing Soviet leader &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Gorbachev\"&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/a&gt;. After the coup's failure General Varennikov was arrested, tried, and prosecuted for treason together with other coup plotters. He was acquitted by the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Supreme Court of Russia&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, as the court concluded he had merely followed orders and had acted \"only in an interest of preserving and strengthening his country\". He was the only member of the group of accused plotters who refused to accept an &lt;a href=\"amnesty\"&gt;amnesty&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater life.\nIn 1995 Varennikov, as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation\"&gt;Communist Party of the Russian Federation&lt;/a&gt;, was elected deputy of the &lt;a href=\"State%20Duma\"&gt;State Duma&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"lower%20house\"&gt;lower house&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Assembly%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Russian parliament&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2003 he joined the &lt;a href=\"Rodina%20%28political%20party%29\"&gt;Rodina&lt;/a&gt; bloc as one of its leaders.\nIn February 2008, Valentin Varennikov was officially accepted as fellow of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Academy%20of%20Natural%20Sciences\"&gt;Russian Academy of Natural Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (Armenian branch) and member of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Academy%20Ararat\"&gt;International Academy Ararat&lt;/a&gt;.

Although Varennikov has been to China before, he has a deep love for the &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20people\"&gt;Chinese people&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the preface to the Chinese version of the book, he wrote: \n\"I have five reasons to love China: first, the Chinese people are outstanding people, and China has a long &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20China\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20culture\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt;; second, she has an amazing development rate today; third, the Chinese people have never threatened anyone, but the Chinese people have been brought to them by the aggressors. However, he finally defeated the aggressor and embarked on the road of national independence. Fourth, China is our great neighbor, and China and Russia have traditional friendship. Fifth, the Chinese leaders trained by the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20China\"&gt;Communist Party of China&lt;/a&gt; led the Chinese people to find the right direction of development in the world economic development system.\nVarennikov was one of Russia's most outspoken defenders of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt;. During 2008, Varennikov presented the case for Stalin as Russia's greatest historical figure on the &lt;a href=\"Name%20of%20Russia%20%28Russia%20TV%29\"&gt;Name of Russia&lt;/a&gt; television project.
