    "text": "Takuyo-Daisan is a &lt;a href=\"guyot\"&gt;guyot&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Western Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. It is deep and has a square-shaped flat top surrounded by a perimeter ridge. Several other &lt;a href=\"Seamount\"&gt;seamounts&lt;/a&gt; lie nearby. \nThe seamount formed as a &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20island\"&gt;volcanic island&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous\"&gt;Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt; in the area currently occupied by &lt;a href=\"French%20Polynesia\"&gt;French Polynesia&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently &lt;a href=\"Reef\"&gt;reefs&lt;/a&gt; developed around the volcanic island and generated a &lt;a href=\"carbonate%20platform\"&gt;carbonate platform&lt;/a&gt; which drowned during the &lt;a href=\"Albian\"&gt;Albian&lt;/a&gt; along with several other such platforms in the world.\nName and research history.\nTakuyo-Daisan was formerly known as \"Seiko guyot\"; \"Seiko guyot\" was used even earlier for &lt;a href=\"Takuyo-Daini\"&gt;Takuyo-Daini&lt;/a&gt; while Takuyo-Daisan was named \"Eiko\". This seamount was drilled by the &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Drilling%20Program\"&gt;Ocean Drilling Program&lt;/a&gt;, with Site 879 located on the seamount.\nGeography and geology.\nTakuyo-Daisan lies southeast of the city of &lt;a href=\"Yokohama\"&gt;Yokohama&lt;/a&gt;, Japan. It is the easternmost seamount in the \"Seiko\" cluster of the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Seamounts\"&gt;Japanese Seamounts&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Boso%20Triple%20Junction\"&gt;Boso Triple Junction&lt;/a&gt; lies only away from the seamount.\nLocal.\nTakuyo-Daisan is a &lt;a href=\"guyot\"&gt;guyot&lt;/a&gt; that rises to a minimum depth of and is capped by an approximately square-shaped surface platform at about depth which has a surface area of about . Depressions up to deep cover the flat top. The top is surrounded by a wide and up to high ridge, especially on the northeastern and southern sides. It may be either a &lt;a href=\"bioherm\"&gt;bioherm&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"karst\"&gt;karst&lt;/a&gt; landform. A - high structure may be part of the old volcanic edifice; the interface between the carbonate platform and the volcanic basement has a sloping aspect.\nAway from the platform, the seamount has steep slopes probably formed by short &lt;a href=\"lava%20flow\"&gt;lava flow&lt;/a&gt;s that rise above the seafloor. Channels, &lt;a href=\"debris%20flow\"&gt;debris flow&lt;/a&gt; fronts and levees decorate its slopes. Noticeable ridges emanate from the east-southeastern, southwestern, west-northwestern and north-northeastern corners of the seamount; they appear to be &lt;a href=\"rift%20zone\"&gt;rift zone&lt;/a&gt;s, and flank cones are found on the eastern slopes. The southern slopes feature &lt;a href=\"Slump%20%28geology%29\"&gt;slump&lt;/a&gt; deposits, and the entire seamount is surrounded by a sediment fan. The volume of the entire seamount is about . Two large seamounts lie west and southwest of Takuyo-Daisan with a smaller seamount between the two; Takuyo-Daini is the western one and Jensen seamount the south-western one. The seafloor underneath Takuyo-Daisan has an age of 143 million years.\nRegional.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Western%20Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Western Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; features many &lt;a href=\"seamount\"&gt;seamount&lt;/a&gt;s with flat tops at depths of below sea level which are known as &lt;a href=\"guyot\"&gt;guyot&lt;/a&gt;s. They were considered to be remnants of eroded islands before &lt;a href=\"Cretaceous\"&gt;Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt; carbonate platforms were discovered on them which resemble present-day &lt;a href=\"atoll\"&gt;atoll&lt;/a&gt;s although they do not have exactly the same properties. Later similar submarine mountains were identified elsewhere in the Pacific Ocean as well. Menard 1958 suggested that the Western Pacific guyots once were part of an elevated region known as the &lt;a href=\"Darwin%20Rise\"&gt;Darwin Rise&lt;/a&gt;, later compared to present day &lt;a href=\"French%20Polynesia\"&gt;French Polynesia&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany of these seamounts originally formed in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;South Pacific&lt;/a&gt;, such as in &lt;a href=\"French%20Polynesia\"&gt;French Polynesia&lt;/a&gt;, where a number of recent volcanoes and volcanic chains can be found. The original location of Takuyo-Daisan closely matches the present-day location of the &lt;a href=\"Society%20hotspot\"&gt;Society hotspot&lt;/a&gt;, and together with Takuyo-Daini, Winterer Guyot and Isakov Guyot appears to form a linear volcanic chain, the Geisha guyots.\nComposition.\nTakuyo-Daisan has erupted &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt; containing &lt;a href=\"olivine\"&gt;olivine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"plagioclase\"&gt;plagioclase&lt;/a&gt; and which define an intermediary to &lt;a href=\"tholeiitic\"&gt;tholeiitic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magma\"&gt;magma&lt;/a&gt; suite. Weathering of volcanic rocks has given rise to &lt;a href=\"calcite\"&gt;calcite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; which also contains &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iddingsite\"&gt;iddingsite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"zeolite\"&gt;zeolite&lt;/a&gt;. Carbonates occur in the form of &lt;a href=\"floatstone\"&gt;floatstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grainstone\"&gt;grainstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"packstone\"&gt;packstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oncoid\"&gt;oncoid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"peloid\"&gt;peloid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rudstone\"&gt;rudstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wackestone\"&gt;wackestone&lt;/a&gt;; the limestone is of &lt;a href=\"reef\"&gt;reef&lt;/a&gt;al origin. &lt;a href=\"Hypersthene\"&gt;Hypersthene&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt; samples taken from Takuyo-Daisan were probably brought there by &lt;a href=\"ice%20raft\"&gt;ice raft&lt;/a&gt;ing as no such rocks have ever been found on this kind of volcanic island.\nGeologic history.\nVolcanism.\nObtaining reliable &lt;a href=\"radiometric%20dating\"&gt;radiometric ages&lt;/a&gt; from Takuyo-Daisan has been difficult; the most reliable age has been obtained from nearby Takuyo-Daini, 118.4 \u00b1 1.8 million years ago. From this date an age of 119.0 \u00b1 1.8 million years ago has been inferred for Takuyo-Daisan. A more recent date from Takuyo-Daisan is 117.5 \u00b1 1.1 million years ago. The seamount formed at 9-7 degrees south from the equator.\nVolcanic activity formed &lt;a href=\"breccia\"&gt;breccia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava%20flow\"&gt;lava flow&lt;/a&gt;s with thicknesses of about and volcanic sediments. The volcanic rocks were subject to &lt;a href=\"weathering\"&gt;weathering&lt;/a&gt;, forming over thick soils. &lt;a href=\"Phreatomagmatic\"&gt;Phreatomagmatic&lt;/a&gt; deposits and rocks interpreted as &lt;a href=\"peperite\"&gt;peperite&lt;/a&gt; have also been found, implying that some lava flows may have interacted with wet soils as they were emplaced. Takuyo-Daisan at this time might have been an at least and possibly as much as high &lt;a href=\"tropical\"&gt;tropical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20island\"&gt;volcanic island&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"marsh\"&gt;marsh&lt;/a&gt;es that were inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Bioturbation\"&gt;bioturbatory&lt;/a&gt; organisms.\nCarbonate sedimentation.\n&lt;a href=\"Carbonate\"&gt;Carbonate&lt;/a&gt; sedimentation at Takyuo-Daisan lasted from the &lt;a href=\"Aptian\"&gt;Aptian&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Albian\"&gt;Albian&lt;/a&gt; (based on &lt;a href=\"foraminifera\"&gt;foraminifera&lt;/a&gt;l &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s) and led to the deposition of about - of carbonate sediment. Carbonate sedimentation took place while the initial volcanic edifice was still emergent, similar to present-day &lt;a href=\"Chuuk%20Lagoon\"&gt;Truk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Micronesia\"&gt;Micronesia&lt;/a&gt;; this resulted in &lt;a href=\"terrigenous\"&gt;terrigenous&lt;/a&gt; sedimentation in the carbonates. The total duration of carbonate sedimentation is about 15 million years, thick distinct sequences in the carbonate sediments may be correlated to &lt;a href=\"Milankovich%20cycle\"&gt;Milankovich cycle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe carbonate platform at Takuyo-Daisan featured both barrier shoals and &lt;a href=\"lagoon\"&gt;lagoon&lt;/a&gt;al environments. Biogenic &lt;a href=\"mound\"&gt;mound&lt;/a&gt;s grew at the margin of the platform. Redeposition of carbonate sediments led to the formation of sandy &lt;a href=\"shoal\"&gt;shoal&lt;/a&gt;s which formed the later perimeter ridge. Overall the environment of the platform was a warm &lt;a href=\"Tethys%20Ocean\"&gt;Tethyan&lt;/a&gt; environment.\n&lt;a href=\"Alga\"&gt;Alga&lt;/a&gt;e including &lt;a href=\"algal%20mat\"&gt;algal mat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bivalve\"&gt;bivalve&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cyanobacteria\"&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"echinoid\"&gt;echinoid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"foraminifera\"&gt;foraminifera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mollusc\"&gt;mollusc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nannofossil\"&gt;nannofossil&lt;/a&gt;-forming species and &lt;a href=\"rudist\"&gt;rudist&lt;/a&gt;s inhabited the carbonate platform, and &lt;a href=\"arthropod\"&gt;arthropod&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;s have been found in the oldest carbonate deposits. The fauna of Takuyo-Daisan was not particularly diverse, probably because the seamount was located close to the paleoequator and away from the &lt;a href=\"Tethys%20Ocean\"&gt;Tethyan&lt;/a&gt; margin that many species found at Takuyo-Daisan originate from. \nDrowning and post-drowning evolution.\nThe drowning of the carbonate platform at Takuyo-Daisan has been attributed to different causes. A large &lt;a href=\"transgression%20%28geology%29\"&gt;transgression&lt;/a&gt; took place in the late &lt;a href=\"Albian\"&gt;Albian&lt;/a&gt; and may have caused the drowning. In other guyots nutrient excess has been implicated but there is no evidence of such at Takuyo-Daisan. Other factors may include hostile conditions close to the equator and unfavourable changes of the geomorphology of the platform at the time of its drowning. The drowning of the Takuyo-Daisan platform was simultaneous to the drowning of carbonate platforms elsewhere around the world and may have been caused by tectonically-induced sea level fluctuations.\nAfter cessation of the platform activity, &lt;a href=\"manganese\"&gt;manganese&lt;/a&gt; crusts and &lt;a href=\"chalk\"&gt;chalk&lt;/a&gt;s later modified by &lt;a href=\"phosphate\"&gt;phosphate&lt;/a&gt; developed on exposed rocks. During the &lt;a href=\"Neogene\"&gt;Neogene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelagic%20sediment%23Oozes\"&gt;oozes&lt;/a&gt;, terrigenous sediments, wind-borne material such as &lt;a href=\"pollen\"&gt;pollen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20ash\"&gt;volcanic ash&lt;/a&gt; from the approaching &lt;a href=\"Volcanoes%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese volcanic arc&lt;/a&gt; accumulated on Takuyo-Daisan.\nPresently, Takuyo-Daisan lies in a region of high &lt;a href=\"plankton\"&gt;plankton&lt;/a&gt; productivity which has led to a high &lt;a href=\"diatom\"&gt;diatom&lt;/a&gt; deposition rate as well as high sedimentation rates in general. &lt;a href=\"Coral\"&gt;Coral&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;s have been found on the seamount; &lt;a href=\"crinoid\"&gt;crinoid&lt;/a&gt;s may also occur there."
