    "text": "John Harrison (12 November 1890 \u2013 3 May 1917) was a professional &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; footballer who played for &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull FC&lt;/a&gt;. He later became a &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army officer&lt;/a&gt;, and was the posthumous recipient of the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; forces.\nEarly life.\nHarrison was born in &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20upon%20Hull\"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt; on 12 November 1890. His father was a plater and boilermaker in the Earles Shipyard. After leaving school, Harrison studied at St John's College, York (now &lt;a href=\"York%20St%20John%20University\"&gt;York St John University&lt;/a&gt;) where he was Rugby club captain and also represented the College at cricket and swimming before becoming a teacher later at Lime Street School in Hull. In York, he caught the attention of the &lt;a href=\"York%20Wasps\"&gt;York rugby league club&lt;/a&gt;, and played for them five times in 1911\u201312, scoring three tries.\nHe returned to Hull in September 1912 and married Lillian on 1 September 1914. He was invited to join &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull F.C.&lt;/a&gt; which included &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Batten\"&gt;Billy Batten&lt;/a&gt;, and played his first match on 5 September 1912. In 1913\u201314 season he scored a record 52 tries and he went on to score a total of 106 tries in 116 matches for Hull up to 1916. Jack Harrison played , i.e. number 2, and scored a &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull F.C.&lt;/a&gt;s 6\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"Wakefield%20Trinity\"&gt;Wakefield Trinity&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1914%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;1914 Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; Final during the &lt;a href=\"1913%E2%80%9314%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20Union%20season%23Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;1913\u201314 season&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Thrum%20Hall\"&gt;Thrum Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halifax%2C%20West%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;, in front of a crowd of 19,000.\nFirst World War.\nNot long after the birth of his son, Jackie, and while living at 75 Wharncliffe Street, Hull, Harrison volunteered for the army. He started receiving officer training on 4 November 1915, as a private in the &lt;a href=\"Inns%20of%20Court%20Regiment\"&gt;Inns of Court Officer Training Corps&lt;/a&gt;. On completion of training, he was commissioned as a probationary temporary &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"East%20Yorkshire%20Regiment\"&gt;East Yorkshire Regiment&lt;/a&gt; on 5 August 1916, and was posted to 6 Platoon, &lt;a href=\"Hull%20Pals\"&gt;11th (Service) Battalion (the Hull Tradesmen)&lt;/a&gt;. In February 1917 the Hull brigade entered the front line once again and Jack was soon in the thick of the action. On 25 February, Harrison led a patrol into &lt;a href=\"no%20man%27s%20land\"&gt;no man's land&lt;/a&gt;, and for this action he was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;Military Cross&lt;/a&gt; (MC). The citation for his MC read:\nOn 3 May 1917 came the actions that led to his VC, during the &lt;a href=\"Capture%20of%20Oppy%20Wood\"&gt;Capture of Oppy Wood&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29\"&gt;Battle of Arras&lt;/a&gt;. Ordered, with the rest of his brigade, to attack a wood near &lt;a href=\"Oppy%2C%20Pas-de-Calais\"&gt;Oppy, Pas-de-Calais&lt;/a&gt;, his platoon became pinned down by machine gun fire. The citation for his VC describes events in more detail:\nHarrison's body was never found. He is commemorated on the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission\"&gt;Commonwealth War Graves Commission&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arras%20Memorial\"&gt;Arras Memorial&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther information.\nLilian Harrison was presented with his Victoria Cross at Buckingham Palace by &lt;a href=\"George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;King George V&lt;/a&gt; in March 1918. The war widow benefitted from a fund raised in Hull to provide for the younger John Harrison\u2019s education. Their son went on to serve as an officer in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Riding%20Regiment\"&gt;Duke of Wellington's West Riding Regiment&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, and was killed as a &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dunkirk\"&gt;defence of Dunkirk&lt;/a&gt;, and is buried in the Dunkirk town cemetery.\nLillian Harrison died on 5 December 1977, and bequeathed Harrison's medals to the East Yorkshire regimental museum in &lt;a href=\"Beverley\"&gt;Beverley&lt;/a&gt; (now part of the Museum of &lt;a href=\"The%20Prince%20of%20Wales%20Own%20Regiment%20of%20Yorkshire%23The%20Prince%20of%20Wales%E2%80%99s%20Own%20Regiment%20of%20Yorkshire%20Museum\"&gt;Prince of Wales\u2019s Own Regiment of Yorkshire Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Tower St, York).\nIn 2017 York St John alumnus Patrick Neal released his biography of Harrison - 'The Heroic Johnsman - the story of Jack Harrison VC, MC'."
