    "text": "Maclear's rat (\"Rattus macleari\") is an extinct large &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20Island\"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. It was one of two species of rat native to Christmas Island, alongside the &lt;a href=\"bulldog%20rat\"&gt;bulldog rat&lt;/a&gt;. Abundant, unfamiliar with and seemingly unafraid of humans, large numbers of the creatures emerged and foraged in all directions at night. Making querulous squeaks, the rats entered the &lt;a href=\"Challenger%20Expedition\"&gt;\"Challenger\" Expedition&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"tent\"&gt;tent&lt;/a&gt;s and shelters in 1886, ran over sleepers, and upset everything in the search and fight for food. Maclear's rat might have been responsible for keeping the population of the &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20Island%20red%20crab\"&gt;Christmas Island red crab&lt;/a&gt; in check, as recent numbers of the crab are greater than in the past. It is thought that &lt;a href=\"black%20rat\"&gt;black rat&lt;/a&gt;s inadvertently introduced by the expedition infected the Maclear's rats with a disease (possibly a &lt;a href=\"Trypanosomatid\"&gt;trypanosome&lt;/a&gt;), which in turn could have contributed to the species' decline. The last recorded sighting was in 1903, although it is possible that Maclear's rats &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28biology%29\"&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt;ized with black rats. A hard tick (\"&lt;a href=\"Ixodes%20nitens\"&gt;Ixodes nitens&lt;/a&gt;\"), described as an &lt;a href=\"ectoparasite\"&gt;ectoparasite&lt;/a&gt; of Maclear's rat, is also thought to be extinct.\nSaid to be related to \"&lt;a href=\"Rattus%20xanthurus\"&gt;Rattus xanthurus&lt;/a&gt;\" of Sulawesi and \"&lt;a href=\"Rattus%20everetti\"&gt;R. everetti&lt;/a&gt;\" of the Philippines, this species was grizzled brown above and lighter on the underside. The lower back had prominent long and black hairs that projected above the shorter fur. The base of the tail was dark with the distal half being scaly white.\nThe rat is named after Captain &lt;a href=\"John%20Maclear\"&gt;John Maclear&lt;/a&gt; (1838\u20131907) of the British survey-ship &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Flying-Fish%20%281873%29\"&gt;HMS \"Flying-Fish\"&lt;/a&gt;, who collected the specimen from Christmas Island in 1886. It was described as a new species by &lt;a href=\"Oldfield%20Thomas\"&gt;Oldfield Thomas&lt;/a&gt; the next year, although it was originally described under the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Mus%20%28genus%29\"&gt;Mus&lt;/a&gt;\". Maclear was earlier commander on &lt;a href=\"HMS%20Challenger%20%281858%29\"&gt;HMS \"Challenger\"&lt;/a&gt; for the \"Challenger\" Expedition of 1872\u20131876 under its commission captain, Sir &lt;a href=\"George%20Nares\"&gt;George Nares&lt;/a&gt;.\nA DNA study found Maclear's rat to be the sister species of &lt;a href=\"Hainald%27s%20rat\"&gt;Hainald's rat&lt;/a&gt; native to the island of &lt;a href=\"Flores\"&gt;Flores&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"clade\"&gt;clade&lt;/a&gt; containing the two being sister to the clade containing \"&lt;a href=\"Nesokia\"&gt;Nesokia&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Bandicota\"&gt;Bandicota&lt;/a&gt;\"; this clade, in turn, is sister to the Australasian \"&lt;a href=\"Rattus\"&gt;Rattus&lt;/a&gt;\" radiation, making \"Rattus\" as currently defined &lt;a href=\"Paraphyly\"&gt;paraphyletic&lt;/a&gt;."
