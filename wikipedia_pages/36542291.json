It is owned by the &lt;a href=\"Rolla%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;City of Rolla&lt;/a&gt; (in adjacent &lt;a href=\"Phelps%20County%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Phelps County&lt;/a&gt;) and located 11\u00a0&lt;a href=\"nautical%20mile\"&gt;nautical mile&lt;/a&gt;s (13\u00a0&lt;a href=\"mile\"&gt;mi&lt;/a&gt;, 20\u00a0&lt;a href=\"kilometre\"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;) north of its &lt;a href=\"central%20business%20district\"&gt;central business district&lt;/a&gt;. The airport is one\u00a0nautical mile (2\u00a0km) northwest of &lt;a href=\"Vichy%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Vichy, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. It is included in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Plan%20of%20Integrated%20Airport%20Systems\"&gt;National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems&lt;/a&gt; for 2011\u20132015, which &lt;a href=\"FAA%20airport%20categories\"&gt;categorized&lt;/a&gt; it as a \"&lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt;\" facility.\nHistory.\nThe airport was originally built by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces\"&gt;United States Army Air Forces&lt;/a&gt; in 1942 as a sub-base for &lt;a href=\"Sedalia%20Army%20Airfield\"&gt;Sedalia Army Airfield&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. It was designated as Vichy Army Airfield, and was used by &lt;a href=\"I%20Troop%20Carrier%20Command\"&gt;I Troop Carrier Command&lt;/a&gt; for training. The &lt;a href=\"Third%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Third Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"76th%20Reconnaissance%20Group\"&gt;76th Reconnaissance Group&lt;/a&gt; operated &lt;a href=\"L-1%20Vigilant\"&gt;L-1 Vigilant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"L-4%20Grasshopper\"&gt;L-4 Grasshopper&lt;/a&gt; light observation aircraft from the airfield in the spring of 1943 in support of Army training at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Leonard%20Wood%20%28military%20base%29\"&gt;Fort Leonard Wood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe airfield was vacated by the Air Force in March 1946; however it was re-activated by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; which used it as an Outlying Field (OLF) for &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Air%20Station%20St.%20Louis\"&gt;Naval Air Station St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;. When the Navy ended its use, it was deeded to the city of Rolla in 1957 and became Rolla National Airport.\nIn August 1959, the &lt;a href=\"USAF\"&gt;USAF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Air%20Defense%20Command\"&gt;Air Defense Command&lt;/a&gt; established site \"P-70C (later Z-70C)\" at the airport. It was an Air Defense Radar Gap-Filler Annex, equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Bendix%20AN/FPS-18%20Radar\"&gt;Bendix AN/FPS-18 Radar&lt;/a&gt; medium-range search Radar , assigned to the &lt;a href=\"798th%20Radar%20Squadron\"&gt;798th Radar Squadron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belleville%20AFS\"&gt;Belleville AFS&lt;/a&gt;, Illinois. The station was inactivated in late 1968. Both building and radar tower (but now without radome) are still extant. The radome was removed in November 2011.\nFacilities and aircraft.\nRolla National Airport covers an area of 1,370 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s (554 &lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;ha&lt;/a&gt;) at an &lt;a href=\"elevation\"&gt;elevation&lt;/a&gt; of 1,148 feet (350 m) above &lt;a href=\"mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;mean sea level&lt;/a&gt;. It has two &lt;a href=\"runway\"&gt;runway&lt;/a&gt;s, designated 4/22 and 13/31, each with an &lt;a href=\"asphalt\"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt; surface measuring 5,500 by 100 feet (1,676 x 30 m).\nFor the 12-month period ending March 31, 2010, the airport had 10,570 aircraft operations, an average of 28 per day: 95% &lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt;, 3% &lt;a href=\"air%20taxi\"&gt;air taxi&lt;/a&gt;, and 2% &lt;a href=\"military%20aviation\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;.
