    "text": "Ocean City is a &lt;a href=\"City%20%28New%20Jersey%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cape%20May%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Cape May County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. It is the principal city of the Ocean City &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Statistical%20Area\"&gt;Metropolitan Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt;, which encompasses all of Cape May County and is part of the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Wilmington%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;Wilmington&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Camden%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Camden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;PA&lt;/a&gt;-NJ-&lt;a href=\"Delaware\"&gt;DE&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;MD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20Valley\"&gt;Combined Statistical Area&lt;/a&gt;. As of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 United States Census&lt;/a&gt;, the city's population was 11,701, reflecting a decline of 3,677 (-23.9%) from the 15,378 counted in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2000 Census&lt;/a&gt;, which had in turn declined by 134 (-0.9%) from the 15,512 counted in the &lt;a href=\"1990%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;1990 Census&lt;/a&gt;. In summer months, with an influx of tourists and second homeowners, there are estimated to be 115,000 to 130,000 within the city's borders.\nOcean City originated as a &lt;a href=\"borough%20%28New%20Jersey%29\"&gt;borough&lt;/a&gt; by an act of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Legislature\"&gt;New Jersey Legislature&lt;/a&gt; on May 3, 1884, from portions of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Upper Township&lt;/a&gt;, based on results from a referendum on April 30, 1884, and was reincorporated as a borough on March 31, 1890. Ocean City was incorporated as a city, its current government form, on March 25, 1897. The city is named for its location on the Atlantic Ocean.\nKnown as a family-oriented seaside resort, Ocean City has not allowed the sale of alcoholic beverages within its limits since its founding in 1879, offering miles of guarded beaches, a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20boardwalks%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Ocean%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;boardwalk&lt;/a&gt; that stretches for , and a downtown shopping and dining district.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Channel\"&gt;Travel Channel&lt;/a&gt; rated Ocean City as the \"Best Family Beach of 2005\". It was ranked the third-best beach in New Jersey in the 2008 Top 10 Beaches Contest sponsored by the New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium. In the 2009 Top 10 Beaches Contest, Ocean City ranked first.\nHistory.\nBefore Ocean City was established, local &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; set up camps on the island for fishing in the summer months. In 1633, &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20%28ethnic%20group%29\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; navigator &lt;a href=\"David%20Pietersz.%20de%20Vries\"&gt;David Pietersz. de Vries&lt;/a&gt; referred to \"flat sand beaches with low hills between Cape May and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Egg%20Harbor%20Bay\"&gt;Egg Harbor&lt;/a&gt;\", possibly the earliest reference to the island that became Ocean City. In 1695, Thomas Budd &lt;a href=\"Surveying\"&gt;surveyed&lt;/a&gt; the land on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Jersey\"&gt;West Jersey&lt;/a&gt; Society. Around 1700, John Peck used the island as a base of operation for storing freshly hunted whales, and subsequently the land became known as \"Peck's Beach\". The first record of a house on Peck's Beach was in 1752. During the 18th century, cattle grazers brought cows to the island, where plentiful trees, weeds, brush, and seagrass provided suitable condition. Parker Miller was the first permanent resident of Peck's Beach in 1859.\nOriginally purchased by the Somers family, the island was formerly named Peck's Beach, believed to have been given the name for a whaler named John Peck. In 1700, whaler John Peck began using the barrier island as a storage place for freshly caught whales. The island was also used as cattle-grazing area, and mainlanders would boat over for a picnic or to hunt. On September 10, 1879, four &lt;a href=\"Methodist\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt; ministers \u2013 Ezra B. Lake, James Lake, S. Wesley Lake, and William Burrell \u2013 chose the island as a suitable spot to establish a &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; retreat and camp meeting on the order of &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Grove%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Ocean Grove&lt;/a&gt;. They met under a tall cedar tree, which stands today in the lobby of the Ocean City Tabernacle. Having chosen the name \"Ocean City\", the founders incorporated the Ocean City Association, and laid out street and lots for cottages, hotel, and businesses. The Ocean City Tabernacle was built between Wesley and Asbury Avenues and between 5th and 6th Streets. Camp meetings were held by the following summer and continue uninterrupted to this day.\nIn 1881, the first school on the island opened. The first bridge to the island was built in 1883, and the &lt;a href=\"West%20Jersey%20and%20Seashore%20Railroad%23West%20Jersey%20Railroad\"&gt;West Jersey Railroad&lt;/a&gt; opened in 1884. Based on a referendum on April\u00a030, 1884, the &lt;a href=\"borough%20%28New%20Jersey%29\"&gt;borough&lt;/a&gt; of Ocean City was formed from portions of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Upper Township&lt;/a&gt;, following an act of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Legislature\"&gt;New Jersey Legislature&lt;/a&gt; on May 3, 1884.\nThe ship \"Sindia\" joined other shipwrecks on the beach on December 15, 1901, on its way to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kobe\"&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, but has since sunk below the sand. A salvage attempt to retrieve treasures believed to have been on the ship was most recently launched in the 1970s, all of which have been unsuccessful. In 1920, the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20commerce\"&gt;Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; adopted the slogan \"America's Greatest Family Resort\". A large fire in 1927 caused $1.5 million in damage and led the city to move the boardwalk closer to the ocean, which resulted in the greater potential for damage from saltwater.\nAlcohol prohibition.\nAs a result of its religious origins, the sale or public drinking of alcoholic beverages in Ocean City was prohibited. In 1881, the Ocean City Association passed a set of &lt;a href=\"Blue%20laws%20in%20the%20United%20States%23New%20Jersey\"&gt;blue laws&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 laws designed to enforce religious standards. The town banned the manufacturing or sale of alcohol in 1909. Promoting water instead of drinking alcohol, the &lt;a href=\"Woman%27s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union\"&gt;Woman's Christian Temperance Union&lt;/a&gt; donated a public fountain, dedicated on &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20Day\"&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/a&gt; in 1915. Despite the prohibition of alcohol within the municipality, illegal saloons operated within Ocean City, and in 1929, prosecutors raided 27\u00a0&lt;a href=\"speakeasy\"&gt;speakeasies&lt;/a&gt;. In 1951, the town banned the consumption of alcohol on the beach, and banned all public alcohol consumption in 1958. During the campaign for a 1986 referendum to repeal the blue laws, ads in the local paper suggested that the repeal could be next. In May 2012, 68.8% of voters rejected a ballot initiative for &lt;a href=\"BYOB\"&gt;BYOB&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 bring your own bottle. As of 2016, Ocean City was one of 32\u00a0&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20dry%20communities%20by%20U.S.%20state%23New%20Jersey\"&gt;dry towns&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey. Despite the prohibition in the city, 18.3% of adults in Ocean City &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20statistical%20area\"&gt;metropolitan statistical area&lt;/a&gt; (which includes all of Cape May County) drink alcohol heavily or &lt;a href=\"binge%20drinking\"&gt;binge drink&lt;/a&gt;, the highest percentage of any metro area in the state; \"&lt;a href=\"USA%20Today\"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;\" listed Ocean City as the state's most drunken city on its 2017 list of \"The drunkest city in every state\". Additionally, a loophole in the law allows private dining clubs adjacent to restaurants to serve alcohol to members.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city had a total area of 11.56 square miles (29.93\u00a0km2), including 6.72 square miles (17.39\u00a0km2) of land and 4.84 square miles (12.53\u00a0km2) of water (41.87%). The island is about long.\n&lt;a href=\"Local%20government%20in%20New%20Jersey%23Unincorporated%20communities\"&gt;Unincorporated communities&lt;/a&gt;, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Peck Beach.\nOcean City is situated on a barrier island bordered by the &lt;a href=\"Strathmere%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Strathmere&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Upper Township&lt;/a&gt; to the south, the &lt;a href=\"Marmora%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Marmora&lt;/a&gt; section of Upper Township to the west, and &lt;a href=\"Somers%20Point%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Somers Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Harbor%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Egg Harbor Township&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Egg%20Harbor%20Bay\"&gt;Great Egg Harbor Bay&lt;/a&gt; to the north. The eastern side of Ocean City borders the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 1951, the beach has been &lt;a href=\"Beach%20nourishment\"&gt;replenished&lt;/a&gt; more than 40\u00a0times, potentially the most of any beach in the country. This is due to erosion caused by storms, and in an extreme instance of erosion, a $5\u00a0million replenishment project in 1982 had largely disappeared within two and a half months. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city owned its own dredge, but ceased replenishment projects when it could not secure permits for dredging the lagoons. Since 1992, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers\"&gt;United States Army Corps of Engineers&lt;/a&gt; has handled responsibility for beach nourishment projects, periodically adding , roughly every three years, using the &lt;a href=\"shoal\"&gt;shoal&lt;/a&gt; area about offshore the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Egg%20Harbor%20Bay\"&gt;Great Egg Harbor Inlet&lt;/a&gt;. The project and funding was authorized in the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Resources%20Development%20Act%20of%201986\"&gt;Water Resources Development Act of 1986&lt;/a&gt;, and the most recent replenishment was completed in December 2017. After &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Sandy\"&gt;Hurricane Sandy&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, the Army Corps completed the city's largest beach replenishment since 1993, adding of sand to replenish the eroded beaches.\nParks.\nThe city utilizes 39% of its land area \u2013 \u2013 for parks and recreation purposes. This includes about of protected dunes and wetlands. There are several parks within the confines of Ocean City, including ten playgrounds scattered across the island. There are also a &lt;a href=\"Volleyball\"&gt;volleyball court&lt;/a&gt;, a shuffleboard court, a hockey rink, four baseball fields, four soccer fields, eight basketball courts, and 24\u00a0tennis courts.\nAcross from the &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20City%20Municipal%20Airport%20%28New%20Jersey%29\"&gt;Ocean City Airport&lt;/a&gt; is the Howard Stainton Wildlife Refuge, a area of wetlands established in 1997. There are no trails, but there is a viewing platform accessible from Bay Avenue. Adjacent to the airport is the Ocean City Municipal Golf Course, a 12\u2013hole course run by the city and open to the public.\nAt the southern end of the island is &lt;a href=\"Corson%27s%20Inlet%20State%20Park\"&gt;Corson's Inlet State Park&lt;/a&gt;, which was established in 1969 to preserve one of the last undeveloped tracts of land along the oceanfront. The park is accessible by &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Drive%20%28New%20Jersey%29\"&gt;Ocean Drive&lt;/a&gt; (Cape May County Route 619), which bisects the park.\nDemographics.\n2010 Census.\nThe Census Bureau's 2006-2010 &lt;a href=\"American%20Community%20Survey\"&gt;American Community Survey&lt;/a&gt; showed that (in 2010 &lt;a href=\"inflation%20adjustment\"&gt;inflation-adjusted&lt;/a&gt; dollars) &lt;a href=\"median%20household%20income\"&gt;median household income&lt;/a&gt; was $55,202 (with a margin of error of +/- $6,710) and the median family income was $79,196 (+/- $11,239). Males had a median income of $48,475 (+/- $5,919) versus $41,154 (+/- $12,032) for females. The &lt;a href=\"per%20capita%20income\"&gt;per capita income&lt;/a&gt; for the city was $40,864 (+/- $3,899). About 5.1% of families and 6.4% of the population were below the &lt;a href=\"poverty%20line\"&gt;poverty line&lt;/a&gt;, including 4.3% of those under age 18 and 5.8% of those age 65 or over.\n2000 Census.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"2000%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2000 United States Census&lt;/a&gt; there were 15,378 people, 7,464 households, and 4,008 families residing in the city. The &lt;a href=\"population%20density\"&gt;population density&lt;/a&gt; was 2,222.8 people per square mile (858.0/km2). There were 20,298 housing units at an average density of 2,934.0 per square mile (1,132.5/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 93.57% &lt;a href=\"White%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;White&lt;/a&gt;, 4.31% &lt;a href=\"African%20American%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt;, 0.12% &lt;a href=\"Native%20American%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt;, 0.56% &lt;a href=\"Asian%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt;, 0.07% &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Islander%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Pacific Islander&lt;/a&gt;, 0.52% from &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28United%20States%20Census%29\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt;, and 0.86% from two or more races. &lt;a href=\"Hispanic%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Hispanic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Latino%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Latino&lt;/a&gt; of any race were 1.99% of the population.\nThere were 7,464 households, out of which 16.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.9% were &lt;a href=\"Marriage\"&gt;married couples&lt;/a&gt; living together, 9.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.3% were non-families. 40.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.02 and the average family size was 2.71.\nIn the city, the population was spread out, with 16.4% under age 18, 5.6% from 18 to 24, 23.8% from 25 to 44, 28.3% from 45 to 64, and 25.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 48 years. For every 100 females, there were 86.4 males. For every 100 women age 18 and over, there were 82.8 men.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $44,158, and the median income for a family was $61,731. Males had a median income of $42,224 versus $31,282 for females. The &lt;a href=\"per%20capita%20income\"&gt;per capita income&lt;/a&gt; for the city was $33,217. About 4.3% of families and 6.8% of the population were below the &lt;a href=\"poverty%20line\"&gt;poverty line&lt;/a&gt;, including 10.0% of those under age 18 and 6.5% of those age 65 or over.\nEconomy.\nBeach.\nThe concept of beach tags at the Jersey Shore was introduced in the late 1920s, but Ocean City did not establish them until 1976. &lt;a href=\"Beach%20tag\"&gt;Beach tag&lt;/a&gt;s are a major source of revenue for the city, with the $4.1 million in revenue generated in the 2016 season, the most of any municipality in the state. In the 2017 budget, the projected $4.1 million in fees for beach tag and $3 million for parking were two of the city's biggest revenue sources, accounting for almost 9% of the city's annual budget of almost $80 million.\nFrom early June through Labor Day, Ocean City requires individuals age 12 and up to purchase a beach tag to access its beaches. For the 2020 season (from June 1, 2020 through September 6, 2020), a one-day pass cost $5, a weekly pass was $10, and a seasonal pass for the full summer season will be $25. Additionally, there are free seasonal beach tags made available to military personnel. Beach tag revenue is used by the city to cover the costs of maintaining and cleaning the beaches. It is also used to provide lifeguards and patrol all down the coast.\nBoardwalk.\nAdjacent to the beach is a long &lt;a href=\"boardwalk%20%28entertainment%20district%29\"&gt;boardwalk&lt;/a&gt; that which runs north from 23rd Street to St. James Place. The boardwalk was first built in 1880 from the Second Street &lt;a href=\"wharf\"&gt;wharf&lt;/a&gt; to Fourth Street and West Avenue. In 1885, plans to extend the boardwalk along the entire beach were made as the city's first amusement house, a pavilion on the beach at 11th street called \"The Excursion\" opened. A second amusement park, the \"I.G. Adams pavilion\", at Ninth Street and the boardwalk, opened soon after but was destroyed by fire in 1893. Following a second catastrophic fire in 1927, the boardwalk and its businesses were rebuilt closer to the ocean on concrete pilings, with parking created for cars in the space where the buildings and boardwalk once stood. The Ocean City Music Pier partially opened one year later, with work completed in time for the 1929 season.\nIn 2007 controversy emerged about the city's proposed use of &lt;a href=\"Tabebuia\"&gt;ip\u00ea&lt;/a&gt;, a type of wood, to re-deck parts of the boardwalk. &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20activists\"&gt;Environmental activists&lt;/a&gt; protested against the city's use of the wood, but the plan went ahead. In Fall 2013, the city began a $10\u00a0million project to rebuild the 85\u00a0year old boardwalk from 5th to 12th Streets. This replaced the concrete substructure from 1928 with wooden supports and pine decking, and included the removal of of sand. Originally intended to be a seven-year project, the work finished two years ahead of schedule in March 2018.\nAttractions.\nIn 1965, the Wonderland Amusement Park opened on the boardwalk at 6th Street, which is now known as &lt;a href=\"Gillians%20Wonderland%20Pier\"&gt;Gillian's Wonderland Pier&lt;/a&gt;. \"Runaway Train\", a steel twister, operated as the park's sole major roller coaster until its removal in 2018. Playland's Castaway Cove, is located on the boardwalk at 10th Street. Two major roller coasters operated there, which were the \"Python\", a looping coaster, and the \"Flitzer\", a wild mouse coaster. A new major shuttle coaster at Castaway Cove, \"Storm\", was planned to be finished in summer 2013. The two older coasters (Python and Flitzer) were removed and for the 2016 summer season, a new ride called \"GaleForce\" was being built, which is a high thrill roller coaster with three linear synchronous motor launches reaching speeds of and a beyond vertical drop. \"GaleForce\" officially opened to the public on May 26, 2017. The new \"Wild Waves\" ride is a family-oriented coaster, with a height of , that wraps around the GaleForce coaster. The new \"Whirlwind\" ride is a figure eight kiddie coaster with spinning cars.\nThere is also a water park located on the boardwalk called \"OC Waterpark\", open during the summer months.\nToday, there are bike and surrey rentals available along many boardwalk cross streets, but bikes and surreys can only be ridden on the boardwalk before noon during the summer. Attractions along the boardwalk include two family amusement parks with rides and games, an arcade, the Music Pier, a water park and various themed miniature golf courses. The Ocean City boardwalk has a wide variety of dining options, from sit-down restaurants to funnel cake.\nMini golf is also an abundant activity on the Boardwalk in Ocean City, with numerous courses such as: &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.facebook.com/goofygolfocnj/\"&gt;Goofy Golf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.congofallsgolf.com\"&gt;Congo Falls&lt;/a&gt;, Tee-Time Golf, and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.hauntedgolf.com/\"&gt;Haunted Golf&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedia.\nMedia publications in Ocean City include its two newspapers, \"The Ocean City Sentinel\" and \"The Gazette\". Ocean City also has a seasonal publication, \"The Ocean City Sure Guide\", and a lifestyle magazine known as \"Ocean City Magazine\".\nSports.\n&lt;a href=\"Ocean%20City%20Nor%27easters\"&gt;Ocean City Nor'easters&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"USL%20League%20Two\"&gt;USL League Two&lt;/a&gt; play at &lt;a href=\"Carey%20Stadium\"&gt;Carey Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernment.\nLocal government.\nThe City of Ocean City was incorporated on March 25, 1897. Since July 1, 1978, the city has operated within the &lt;a href=\"Faulkner%20Act\"&gt;Faulkner Act&lt;/a&gt;, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the &lt;a href=\"Faulkner%20Act%20%28mayor%E2%80%93council%29\"&gt;mayor\u2013council&lt;/a&gt; system of municipal government, which is used in 71 municipalities (of the 565) statewide. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the City Council. The mayor, the chief executive of the community, is chosen &lt;a href=\"at-large\"&gt;at-large&lt;/a&gt; for a four-year term at the municipal election in May and serves part-time for a yearly salary. The mayor neither presides over, nor has a vote on the council. The mayor has veto power over ordinances, but any veto can be overridden by a vote of two-thirds of the Council. The City Council is the legislative body and is comprised of seven members, of which four members represent individual &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;wards&lt;/a&gt; and three are elected at-large. Each council person serves a staggered four-year term, with the three at-large seats and the mayoral seat up for election together, followed by the four ward seats which are voted upon two years later.\n, the mayor of Ocean City is Jay A. Gillian, whose term of office ends June 30, 2022. Members of the city council are Council President Peter Madden (2022; At Large), Council Vice President Anthony P. \"Tony\" Wilson (2020; Third Ward), Robert S. \"Bobby\" Barr (2020; Fourth Ward), Karen A. Bergman (2022; At Large), Michael DeVlieger (2020; First Ward), Keith Hartzell (2022; At Large), with a vacant seat representing the second ward.\nThe Second Ward seat expiring in December 2020 has been vacant since December 2020, when &lt;a href=\"Antwan%20McClellan\"&gt;Antwan McClellan&lt;/a&gt; resigned to take office in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20General%20Assembly\"&gt;New Jersey General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn September 2015, Councilman Michael Allegretto resigned from his seat expiring in December 2018 to take a position as the city's Director of Community Services. As the council could not reach agreement on a successor in the month following the resignation, the position remained vacant until a successor was chosen in the May 2016 municipal election to serve the balance of the term of office.
