    "text": "The Oceanographic Museum (\"Mus\u00e9e oc\u00e9anographique\") is a museum of marine sciences in &lt;a href=\"Monaco-Ville\"&gt;Monaco-Ville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monaco\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is home to the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Science%20Commission\"&gt;Mediterranean Science Commission&lt;/a&gt;. This building is part of the &lt;a href=\"Institut%20oc%C3%A9anographique\"&gt;Institut oc\u00e9anographique&lt;/a&gt;, which is committed to sharing its knowledge of the oceans.\nHistory.\nThe Oceanographic Museum was inaugurated in 1910 by Monaco's modernist reformer, &lt;a href=\"Albert%20I%2C%20Prince%20of%20Monaco\"&gt;Prince Albert I&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Jacques-Yves%20Cousteau\"&gt;Jacques-Yves Cousteau&lt;/a&gt; was director from 1957 to 1988. The Museum celebrated its centenary in March 2010, after extensive renovations.\nOverview.\nThe museum is home to exhibitions and collections of various species of sea fauna (starfish, seahorses, turtles, jellyfish, crabs, lobsters, rays, sharks, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, eels, cuttlefish etc.). The museum's holdings also include a great variety of sea related objects, including model ships, sea animal skeletons, tools, weapons etc., as well as a collection of material culture and ritual objects made from, or integrating materials such as pearls, molluscs and nacre.\nAt the first floor, \"A Sailor\u2019s Career\" showcases the work of Prince Albert I. It includes the laboratory from \"L\u2019Hirondelle\", the first of Prince Albert's research yachts. Observations made there led to an understanding of the phenomenon of &lt;a href=\"anaphylaxis\"&gt;anaphylaxis&lt;/a&gt;, for which Dr &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Richet\"&gt;Charles Richet&lt;/a&gt; received the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine\"&gt;Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine&lt;/a&gt; in 1913.\nAn aquarium in the basement of the museum presents a wide array of flora and fauna. Four thousand species of fish and over 200 families of invertebrates can be seen. The aquarium also features a presentation of Mediterranean and tropical marine ecosystems.\nNumerous artists display their artworks in the museum, such as &lt;a href=\"Damien%20Hirst\"&gt;Damien Hirst&lt;/a&gt; and .\nArchitecture.\nThis monumental example of highly charged &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Baroque Revival architecture&lt;/a&gt; has an impressive fa\u00e7ade above the sea, towering over the sheer cliff face to a height of 279 feet (85.04 m). It took eleven years to build, using 100,000 tons of stone from &lt;a href=\"La%20Turbie\"&gt;La Turbie&lt;/a&gt;. During construction, the names of twenty well-known oceanographic &lt;a href=\"research%20vessel\"&gt;research vessel&lt;/a&gt;s personally selected by Prince Albert I were inscribed into the &lt;a href=\"frieze\"&gt;frieze&lt;/a&gt; of the museum's &lt;a href=\"Facade\"&gt;fa\u00e7ade&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Caulerpa taxifolia\".\nIn 1989, French marine biologist &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Meinesz\"&gt;Alexandre Meinesz&lt;/a&gt; discovered a patch of a giant, tropical seaweed \"&lt;a href=\"Caulerpa%20taxifolia\"&gt;Caulerpa taxifolia&lt;/a&gt;\" directly under the walls of the museum. Several documentaries point to this patch as the origin of one of the largest seaweed contaminations of the Mediterranean Sea in recent history. The role of the museum and its director, &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Doumenge\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Doumenge&lt;/a&gt; when the discovery was made public is still heavily debated."
