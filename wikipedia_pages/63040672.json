    "text": "\u0130clal Ar (1904 \u2013 2 October 2007) was one of the first Turkish sopranos. She was a member of the \n&lt;a href=\"Turkish%20State%20Opera%20and%20Ballet%23Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul State Opera and Ballet&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly years.\n\u0130clal was born in 1904. She became one of the first opera singers of Turkey. \nShe found a job as &lt;a href=\"film%20editing\"&gt;film cutter&lt;/a&gt; at \u0130pek Film Studios in Istanbul. Her next job in the studio was to run films for visitors. Film director &lt;a href=\"Muhsin%20Ertu%C4%9Frul\"&gt;Muhsin Ertu\u011frul&lt;/a&gt; wanted her to appear in films. However, she rejected that offer. There, she met renowned poet &lt;a href=\"N%C3%A2z%C4%B1m%20Hikmet\"&gt;N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet&lt;/a&gt;, who was working as a screenwriter. She remembers that, \"although he was already married, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet developed a romantic relationship to the red-haired young girl. He wrote songs for operettas featuring red-haired women, and read those to her.\"\nIn 1933, she married Vedat Ar, who, coming from &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, France, started to work as &lt;a href=\"scenic%20design\"&gt;scenic design&lt;/a&gt;er at the same film studio. She soon left the film studio and became a housewife. Her husband was later employed at the &lt;a href=\"Istanbul%20City%20Theatres\"&gt;Istanbul City Theatres&lt;/a&gt;. \nSinging career.\nThe family held meetings at home with friends from the art circle performing &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20tango%20music\"&gt;Turkish tango music&lt;/a&gt; with accordion played by Necip Celal. During those meetings, &lt;a href=\"Mesut%20Cemil\"&gt;Mesut Cemil&lt;/a&gt;, then director of Radio Istanbul, offered to have her sing at the radio. She performed a tango of Necip Celal under the &lt;a href=\"pseudonym\"&gt;pseudonym&lt;/a&gt; \"K\u0131z\u0131l Ay\" (\"Red Moon\") in relation to her hair color.\nIn the 1950s, Istanbul Conservatory made efforts to establish a choir under the conduct of Muhittin Sadak. She joined the choir and performed for nine years. During this period, she also served as soloist. She was tutored by Muhittin Sadak and also by Italian composer and singing teacher &lt;a href=\"Italo%20Brancucci\"&gt;Italo Brancucci&lt;/a&gt;, with whom she also performed &lt;a href=\"Concert%23Recital\"&gt;recital&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe first concert of the conservatory choir in 1950 attracted great attention. The choir with 70 members was a major breakthrough in this field for Turkey at the time. The concert featured music by &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Haydn\"&gt;Haydn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Brahms\"&gt;Brahms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Schumann\"&gt;Schumann&lt;/a&gt;. SFaruk Yener, a critic, wrote after the concert that, \"she promised a bright future as soprana with her solo performance in the addio.\" A review from the newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Ak%C5%9Fam\"&gt;Ak\u015fam&lt;/a&gt;\" praised her for \"her singing quality and volume-sonore\" after the second concert of the choir in 1951, at which she solo performed the song &lt;a href=\"Ave%20Maria%20%28Schubert%29\"&gt;Ave Maria&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Schubert\"&gt;Schubert&lt;/a&gt;. The same year, she gave a concert accompanied by Italo Brancucci on the piano. In 1954, she gave a concert together with &lt;a href=\"Ferdi%20Statzer\"&gt;Ferdi Statzer&lt;/a&gt; on the piano broadcast by Istanbul Radio. She gave a concert accompanied by Ferdi Statzer again on 19 May that year, on the &lt;a href=\"Commemoration%20of%20Atat%C3%BCrk%2C%20Youth%20and%20Sports%20Day\"&gt;Commemoration of Atat\u00fcrk, Youth and Sports Day&lt;/a&gt;. \nMeanwhile, Muhsin Ertu\u011frul initiated the establishment of a singing studio () in Istanbul as part of the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20State%20Opera%20and%20Ballet%23%23Ankara\"&gt;Ankara State Opera&lt;/a&gt;. German and Italian music tutors taught Turkish singers in the five-story building with a piano at every floor. She entered the studio after passing an exam. She attended the singing studio for about four years.\nAfter the foundation of Istanbul State Opera, she was admitted to the opera following an entrance exam. \u0130clal Ar starred in the operas \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Consul\"&gt;The Consul&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Gian%20Carlo%20notti\"&gt;Gian Carlo notti&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Cavalleria%20rusticana\"&gt;Cavalleria rusticana&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Mascagni\"&gt;Pietro Mascagni&lt;/a&gt;. She retired from the opera after four years.\nLater years and death.\nIn retirement, she devoted herself to handcrafting decorative wax candles. In 1967, she exhibited her 111 of her products in various forms and different colors at the Beyo\u011flu City Gallery. The decoration of the hall was carried out by her husband. Later, she developed a hobby in photography.\nIn 2000, she adopted Mine Belk\u0131s Ar (n\u00e9e Kalyoncu) as daughter. \u0130clal Ar died at the age of 103 on 2 October 2007. She had been bedridden after she broke her hip bone at her home in Istanbul one year previously. She was interred in the family grave at Rumelihisar\u0131 Cemetery following the religious funeral service held in &lt;a href=\"Zincirlikuyu%20Cemetery\"&gt;Zincirlikuyu Mosque&lt;/a&gt;. She was survived by her adoptive daughter."
