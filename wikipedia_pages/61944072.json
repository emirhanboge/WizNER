    "text": "The Sax Altman Tournament was a &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; tournament held in New Zealand in late November 1968. The event was played on the Lochiel course near &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Hamilton, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first event of the New Zealand's summer golf circuit. The event resulted in a tie between &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Thomson%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Peter Thomson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Wolstenholme\"&gt;Guy Wolstenholme&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kel%20Nagle\"&gt;Kel Nagle&lt;/a&gt; finished a stroke behind. Wolstenholme missed a 14-foot putt on the final green that would have given him an outright victory."
