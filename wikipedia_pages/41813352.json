    "text": "Envy is a trademarked brand of the Scilate &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt; variety. Scilate is the result of a cross between Royal &lt;a href=\"Gala%20%28apple%29\"&gt;Gala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Braeburn\"&gt;Braeburn&lt;/a&gt;. It was developed in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"HortResearch\"&gt;HortResearch&lt;/a&gt;, submitted for a patent in 2008 and patented in 2009.\nThe Envy apple is a mostly red with yellow specks. The peel is fairly thick and tough. The flesh is pale yellow. It is a sweet apple with low acid and a slightly flowery taste. \nDistribution of the Envy apple in North America began in 2009 through the &lt;a href=\"Oppenheimer%20Group\"&gt;Oppenheimer Group&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ENZA\"&gt;ENZA&lt;/a&gt; (The New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board); they began small commercial volumes in 2012 in &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28state%29\"&gt;Washington state&lt;/a&gt;. The first fruit surpassed 100,000 cartons for production in 2014. The companies anticipate harvesting 2 million cartons of the fruit by 2020.\nEnvy apples are being grown under license in New Zealand, Australia, Washington (U.S. state) and &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;. Field tests are also being done in the UK, France, and with organic cultivation in Italy."
