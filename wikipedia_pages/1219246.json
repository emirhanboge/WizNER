    "text": "Strange Fruit Records was an &lt;a href=\"independent%20record%20label\"&gt;independent record label&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe label, established by &lt;a href=\"Clive%20Selwood\"&gt;Clive Selwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Peel\"&gt;John Peel&lt;/a&gt; in 1986, was the primary distributor of &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%20One\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; recordings, including &lt;a href=\"Peel%20Sessions\"&gt;Peel Sessions&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name came from &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Fruit\"&gt;the song&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=\"Abel%20Meeropol\"&gt;Abel Meeropol&lt;/a&gt; and famously performed by &lt;a href=\"Billie%20Holiday\"&gt;Billie Holiday&lt;/a&gt;, itself a reference to racially motivated lynchings. The label had the aim of generating sufficient revenue from recordings of 'big name' artists to allow the release of recordings by lesser-known artists. The label's first release was &lt;a href=\"New%20Order%20%28band%29\"&gt;New Order&lt;/a&gt;'s 1982 Peel Session, in July 1987, and was followed by sessions from some of the biggest names from the &lt;a href=\"punk%20rock\"&gt;punk rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"post%20punk\"&gt;post punk&lt;/a&gt; eras. Recordings from as far back as the 1960s were also released by the likes of &lt;a href=\"Jimi%20Hendrix\"&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bonzo%20Dog%20Doo-Dah%20Band\"&gt;Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band&lt;/a&gt;. As well as individual sessions, the label also released albums compiling several sessions by the same artist. Strange Fruit was sufficiently successful that it spawned subsidiary labels including Nighttracks (sessions from radio One's Evening Show), &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Fruit%20Records\"&gt;Raw Fruit Records&lt;/a&gt; (concert recordings from the &lt;a href=\"Reading%20Festival\"&gt;Reading Festival&lt;/a&gt;), and Band of Joy (BBC session recordings from the 1960s and 1970s). In 1994, Peel's BBC colleague &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Kershaw\"&gt;Andy Kershaw&lt;/a&gt; started another subsidiary label, Strange Roots, which released session recordings by &lt;a href=\"world%20music\"&gt;world music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20music\"&gt;roots&lt;/a&gt; artists from his radio show.\nStrange Fruit closed in 2004. It was part of the Zomba Group of companies and was shut down when the label merged with BMG. The last release the label put together was an album of New Order's complete Peel Sessions, fitting seeing as the first release that came out was an EP of New Order's first Peel session. Six months later John Peel died.\nClive Selwood died in June 2020.\nStrange Fruit Records Catalogue (Peel Sessions, BBC).\nOther albums.\nA bootleg of the White Power rock band &lt;a href=\"Skrewdriver\"&gt;Skrewdriver&lt;/a&gt;'s Peel Session exists, in very bad quality and with a cover in the style of the Strange Fruit Peel Session releases. It however is not a Strange Fruit release."
