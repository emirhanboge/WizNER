    "text": "Hasankeyf ( \"\u1e24i\u1e63n Kayfa\u2018\", , \"Harsnk\u2019v\", , \"Kiphas\", , ) is an ancient town and district located along the &lt;a href=\"Tigris\"&gt;Tigris&lt;/a&gt; River in the &lt;a href=\"Batman%20Province\"&gt;Batman Province&lt;/a&gt; in southeastern &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. It was declared a natural conservation area by Turkey in 1981.\nDespite local and international objections, the city and its archaeological sites have been flooded as part of the &lt;a href=\"Il%C4%B1su%20Dam\"&gt;Il\u0131su Dam&lt;/a&gt; project. By 1 April 2020, water levels reached an elevation of 498.2m, covering the whole town.\nToponymy.\nHasankeyf is an ancient settlement that has borne many names from a variety of cultures during its history. The variety of these names is compounded by the many ways that non-Latin alphabets such as &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20alphabet\"&gt;Syriac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20alphabet\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; can be transliterated. Underlying these many names is much continuity between cultures in the basic identification of the site.\nThe city of \"Il\u0101n\u1e63ur\u0101\" mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Akkadian%20language\"&gt;Akkadian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Semitic\"&gt;Northwest Semitic&lt;/a&gt; texts of the &lt;a href=\"Mari%20Tablets\"&gt;Mari Tablets&lt;/a&gt; (1800\u20131750 BC) may possibly be Hasankeyf, although other sites have also been proposed. By the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; period, the fortified town was known in &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; as \"Cephe\", \"Cepha\" or \"Ciphas\", a name that appears to derive from the &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20language\"&gt;Syriac&lt;/a&gt; word &lt;a href=\"wikt%3A%DC%9F%DC%90%DC%A6%DC%90\"&gt;\u071f\u0710\u0726\u0710&lt;/a&gt; (\"kefa\" or \"kifo\"), meaning \"rock\". As the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; portions of the Roman Empire split around AD 330, \u039a\u03b9\u03c6\u03b1\u03c2 (\"Kiphas\") became formalized as the &lt;a href=\"Koine%20Greek\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; name for this Byzantine bishopric.\nFollowing the Arab conquest of 640, the town became known under the &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; name (\"\u1e24i\u1e63n Kayfa\"). \"Hisn\" means \"fortress\" in Arabic, so the name overall means \"rock fortress\". Western reports about the town before the 20th century refer to it by various names that are transliterated from Arabic or Ottoman Turkish. The most popular of these were \"Hisn Kaifa\" and \"Hisn Kayfa\", although a wide variety of others are used including \"\u1e24i\u1e63n Kaif\u0101\", \"\u1e24i\u1e63n Kayf\u0101\", \"\u1e24i\u1e63n Kayf\u00e2\", \"\u1e24i\u1e63n K\u012bf\u0101\", \"\u1e24i\u1e63n K\u00eef\u00e2\", \"Hisn Kayf\", \"Husn Kayfa\", \"Hassan-Keyf\", \"Hosnkeif\" and \"Husunke\u00eff\". Two early Armenian historians list additional names for the town: \"Harsenkev\" () is recorded by &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20of%20Edessa\"&gt;Matthew of Edessa&lt;/a&gt; (Mesrob Eretz) and \"Kentzy\" is recorded by P. Lucas Ingigian.\nAs part of &lt;a href=\"Atat%C3%BCrk%27s%20Reforms\"&gt;Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms&lt;/a&gt; in the 1920s and '30s, many place names were modified to more Turkish-sounding forms and the town's official name was changed to \"Hasankeyf\". This version appears occasionally in foreign reports in the mid 20th-century but only becomes prevalent after about 1980.\nHistory.\nMiddle Bronze (Il\u0101n\u1e63ur\u0101?).\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Bronze%20Age\"&gt;Middle Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt; the area around Hasankeyf was likely part of the &lt;a href=\"Hurrian\"&gt;Hurrian&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms. The &lt;a href=\"Akkadian%20language\"&gt;Akkadian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Semitic\"&gt;Northwest Semitic&lt;/a&gt; texts of the &lt;a href=\"Mari%20Tablets\"&gt;Mari Tablets&lt;/a&gt; (1800\u20131750 BC) refer to \"Il\u0101n\u1e63ur\u0101\", an important walled city on a large river. \"Il\u0101n\u1e63ur\u0101\" has been tentatively identified with Hasankeyf, although several locations in northeast Syria have also been proposed.\nLate Bronze.\nBy the 14th century BC, the Hasankeyf area was within the Hurrian kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Mitanni\"&gt;Mitanni&lt;/a&gt;. Between the 9th and 7th centuries BC it was part of the &lt;a href=\"Neo-Assyrian%20Empire\"&gt;Neo-Assyrian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and by the mid-6th century it was part of the &lt;a href=\"Medes\"&gt;Median empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoman and Byzantine empires.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Roman%20empire\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; times, Hasankeyf (known as \"Kepha\", \"Cephe\", \"Cepha\" or \"Ciphas\") was a base for &lt;a href=\"Roman%20legion\"&gt;legionaries&lt;/a&gt; on the frontier with the &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Sasanian Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Persia.\nFor a time the town became the capital of the Roman province of &lt;a href=\"Arzanene\"&gt;Arzanene&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href=\"Nusaybin\"&gt;Nisibis&lt;/a&gt; was the headquarters of the \"&lt;a href=\"Dux%20Mesopotamiae\"&gt;Dux Mesopotamiae&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Constantius%20II\"&gt;Constantius II&lt;/a&gt; (324\u2013361) built a fort at Kepha, but it is unclear whether this was on the current citadel site. The existence of a Roman bridge across the Tigris at Hasankeyf has been viewed as \"highly probable\" by one scholar who speculates that (like the later bridge) it may have had \"a wooden superstructure based on piers of masonry and natural stone\". However, none of the remaining structure of the bridge appears to date from Roman times.\nThe balance of power in the region shifted significantly in 363. Following the death of the emperor &lt;a href=\"Julian%20%28emperor%29\"&gt;Julian&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Samarra\"&gt;Battle of Samarra&lt;/a&gt;, his successor &lt;a href=\"Jovian%20%28emperor%29\"&gt;Jovian&lt;/a&gt; was forced to surrender to the Persian King &lt;a href=\"Shapur%20II\"&gt;Shapur II&lt;/a&gt; the eastern provinces of &lt;a href=\"Arzanene\"&gt;Arzanene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moxoene\"&gt;Moxoene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zabdicene\"&gt;Zabdicene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corduene\"&gt;Corduene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rehimena\"&gt;Rehimena&lt;/a&gt;. This included 15 castles, along with the cities of &lt;a href=\"Singara\"&gt;Singara&lt;/a&gt; and Nisibis, but not their inhabitants, and the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Castra%20Maurorum\"&gt;Castra Maurorum&lt;/a&gt;. While Kiphas had been administered as part of Arzanene up to 363, it lay on the south bank of the Tigris and was not surrendered to the Sasanians. Before the treaty, the fort at Kiphas had been on the border between Roman territory and the Armenian vassal kingdom of Arzanene. Now the border with Persia ran along the Tigris and the legionnaires at Kiphas were stationed right on it. Their role was chiefly to protect the &lt;a href=\"Tur%20Abdin\"&gt;Tur Abdin&lt;/a&gt; massif and the approach through it to the Roman province of &lt;a href=\"Sophanene\"&gt;Sophanene&lt;/a&gt; from attack by the Persians in Arzanene.\nRecording the situation at the end of the fourth century, the \"&lt;a href=\"Notitia%20Dignitatum\"&gt;Notitia Dignitatum&lt;/a&gt;\" identifies Cepha as the seat of the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Legio%20II%20Parthica\"&gt;Legio II Parthica&lt;/a&gt;. The bishop of Cepha is recorded as attending the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Chalcedon\"&gt;Council of Chalcedon&lt;/a&gt; in October 451, which implies the settlement must have become a sizeable town by that time. As the use of Latin began to wane in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Eastern Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, \"\u039a\u03b9\u03c6\u03b1\u03c2\" (\"Kiphas\") became formalized as the &lt;a href=\"Koine%20Greek\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; name for the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diocese\"&gt;bishopric&lt;/a&gt;.\nRescue excavations from 2005 to 2008 uncovered evidence of the base of a Roman gateway to the upper city, a row of shops from the late Roman period, and Roman floor and wall mosaics.\nBy the sixth century, the Persians were mounting frequent attacks on the eastern border of the Byzantine empire. As a consequence, the Byzantines built a great number of military installations in the region during the early and mid-sixth century. Despite this the Persians seized the opportunity of a Byzantine civil war to attack the eastern provinces, in what became the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian%20War%20of%20602%E2%80%93628\"&gt;Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628&lt;/a&gt;. Early in the conflict they occupied Kiphas along with &lt;a href=\"Mardin\"&gt;Mardin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dara%20%28Mesopotamia%29\"&gt;Dara&lt;/a&gt; and probably the rest of the Tur Abdin, and these were held for most of the rest of the war. The treaty that concluded the war restored Kiphas to Byzantine control, but the gain was to prove short-lived. Writing between about 600 and 610, the Byzantine geographer &lt;a href=\"George%20of%20Cyprus\"&gt;George of Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; mentions Cepha as a fortress in the &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt; section of his \"Descriptio Orbis Romani\".\nMuslim conquest.\nBy the 630s, Muslim Arab forces had conquered large parts of Mesopotamia, Syria and Iran. Kiphas appears most likely to have been captured during the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Armenia\"&gt;Muslim conquest of Armenia&lt;/a&gt; in 640, shortly after the conquest of &lt;a href=\"Nisibis\"&gt;Nisibis&lt;/a&gt;. An account from this period provides the earliest mention of any bridge across the Tigris at this site.\nOver the subsequent five centuries, the town was ruled Arab dynasties under the name Hisn Kayfa, first by the &lt;a href=\"Ummayad\"&gt;Ummayad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abbasid\"&gt;Abbasid&lt;/a&gt; caliphates and later by semi-autonomous &lt;a href=\"Hamdanid\"&gt;Hamdanid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwanid\"&gt;Marwanid&lt;/a&gt; rulers.\nFatima, the &lt;a href=\"Kurds\"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; mother of the Hamdanid ruler &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Taghlib\"&gt;Abu Taghlib&lt;/a&gt;, took control of the town in 900 A.D.\nArtuqid period (1102\u20131232).\nIn the 11th century, &lt;a href=\"Seljuq%20Turks\"&gt;Seljuk Turks&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Turkmen%20people\"&gt;Turkmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oghuz%20Turks\"&gt;Oghuz&lt;/a&gt; allies moved into &lt;a href=\"Western%20Armenia\"&gt;Western Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, culminating in the Seljuk defeat of &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; forces at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Manzikert\"&gt;Battle of Manzikert&lt;/a&gt; in 1071. Victory at Manzikert quickly resulted in Seljuk forces controlling large parts of Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia. The Seljuk sultan &lt;a href=\"Barkiyaruq\"&gt;Barkiy\u0101ruq&lt;/a&gt; granted Hisn Kayfa as a &lt;a href=\"Iqta%27\"&gt;\"iqt\u00e2\"'&lt;/a&gt; to the Artuqids in AH 495 (1101/1102).\nIn 1104, &lt;a href=\"Joscelin%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Edessa\"&gt;Joscelin I of Edessa&lt;/a&gt;, at that time the count of &lt;a href=\"Turbessel\"&gt;Turbessel&lt;/a&gt;, was imprisoned at Hisn Kayfa by &lt;a href=\"S%C3%B6kmen%20%28Artuqid%29\"&gt;S\u00f6kmen&lt;/a&gt; after he was captured at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Harran\"&gt;Battle of Harran&lt;/a&gt; along with his kinsman &lt;a href=\"Baldwin%20II%20of%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Baldwin II of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Edessa%23Counts%20of%20Edessa\"&gt;count of Edessa&lt;/a&gt;. Baldwin was imprisoned at Mosul by the Seljuk atabeg &lt;a href=\"Jikirmish\"&gt;Jikirmish&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of Jikirmish in 1107 and the payment of a significant ransom, Baldwin II and Joscelin I were released. Coincidentally, both men later became prisoners of &lt;a href=\"Belek%20Ghazi\"&gt;Belek Ghazi&lt;/a&gt; in 1122/1123.\nControl of trade along the &lt;a href=\"Diyarbak%C4%B1r\"&gt;Diyarbak\u0131r&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Mosul\"&gt;Mosul&lt;/a&gt; road paralleling the Tigris, and north\u2013south between &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Van\"&gt;Lake Van&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Euphrates\"&gt;Euphrates&lt;/a&gt; generated prosperity for the Artuqids and ensured their power in the region. Consequently, the existence of a reliable river crossing for goods and people was a priority, and the Artuqids built a &lt;a href=\"Old%20Bridge%2C%20Hasankeyf\"&gt;bridge across the Tigris&lt;/a&gt; at some time between 1147 and 1172.\nThis period was something of a golden age for Hisn Kayfa, with the Artuqids and their successors, the &lt;a href=\"Ayyubids\"&gt;Ayyubids&lt;/a&gt;, building the Small Palace and the Great Palace as well as the Tigris bridge. The infrastructure, location and significance of the city helped increase trade and made Hisn Kayfa a staging post on the &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Road\"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Sha\u02bfban 600 (April 1204), the Artuqid emir &lt;a href=\"al-Salih%20Mahmud\"&gt;al-Salih Mahmud&lt;/a&gt;, who controlled both &lt;a href=\"Amida%20%28Mesopotamia%29\"&gt;Amida&lt;/a&gt; and Hisn Kayfa, joined with &lt;a href=\"Al-Ashraf%20Musa%2C%20Emir%20of%20Damascus\"&gt;al-Ashraf&lt;/a&gt;, the Ayyubid ruler of &lt;a href=\"Harran\"&gt;Harran&lt;/a&gt;, and princes from &lt;a href=\"Mayafaraqin\"&gt;Mayafaraqin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cizre\"&gt;Cizre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sinjar\"&gt;Sinjar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Irbil\"&gt;Irbil&lt;/a&gt; to rout the army of &lt;a href=\"Nur%20ad-Din%20Arslan%20Shah%20I\"&gt;Nur ad-Din Arslan Shah I&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zengid\"&gt;Zengid&lt;/a&gt; ruler of &lt;a href=\"Mosul\"&gt;Mosul&lt;/a&gt;, in a battle near &lt;a href=\"Nusaybin\"&gt;Nusaybin&lt;/a&gt;. In the second half of , al-Salih Mahmud also lent his forces to help al-Ashraf attack &lt;a href=\"Harput\"&gt;Harput&lt;/a&gt;, which was controlled by another branch of the Artuqids.\nBy , al-Salih's successor, &lt;a href=\"Rukn%20al-Din%20Madud\"&gt;Rukn al-Din Madud&lt;/a&gt;, was allied with the &lt;a href=\"Khwarazmian%20dynasty\"&gt;Khwarazmshah&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jalal%20ad-Din%20Mingburnu\"&gt;Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu&lt;/a&gt; against the Ayyubid rulers &lt;a href=\"Al-Ashraf%20Musa%2C%20Emir%20of%20Damascus\"&gt;al-Ashraf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"al-Kamil\"&gt;al-Kamil&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 1232, control of Amida and Hisn Kayfa had passed to the Artuqid prince &lt;a href=\"al-Mas%CA%BFud\"&gt;al-Mas\u02bfud&lt;/a&gt;. Troubled by the alliance with Khwarazm, al-Ashraf and al-Kamil resolved to attack Amida, and used as a pretext reports of al-Mas\u02bfud's misrule, including his abuse of local women. The combined Ayyubid armies, swelled by contributions from many of their vassals, besieged Amida on 20 Dhu-l-Hijja 629/5 October 1232. By 1 Muhharam 630/18 October 1232, al-Mas\u02bfud surrendered Amida to al-Kamil. Al-Kamil then sent his brother, al-Ashraf, along with al-Muzaffar Ghazi of &lt;a href=\"Mayafaraqin\"&gt;Mayafaraqin&lt;/a&gt; to Hisn Kayfa to obtain its surrender. Even though, the Ayyubid force had brought with them al-Mas\u02bfud as a captive, the garrison at Hisn Kayfa resisted for some time, and the city was captured only in Safar 630/November 1232.\nAyyubids and Mongols (1232\u20131462).\nOnce the citadel fell to the Ayyubid forces, al-Kamil immediately installed his 27-year-old son, &lt;a href=\"as-Salih%20Ayyub\"&gt;as-Salih Ayyub&lt;/a&gt;, as governor of both Amida and Hisn Kayfa, beginning the period of Ayyubid rule over the Diyar Bakr.\nAyyubid rule of Hisn Kayfa was insecure almost from the start. During 1235, the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Rum\"&gt;Rum Seljuk&lt;/a&gt; forces of &lt;a href=\"Kayqubad%20I\"&gt;'Al\u0101 ad-D\u012bn Kayqub\u0101d&lt;/a&gt; had advanced into Southeast Anatolia, capturing &lt;a href=\"Harput\"&gt;Harput&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Urfa\"&gt;Urfa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harran\"&gt;Harran&lt;/a&gt;. In Dhu-l-Hijja 632/August 1235, they laid siege to Amida, but were unsuccessful in capturing the city and consequently did not advance as far as Hisn Kayfa.\nOnly five years after Hisn Kayfa was captured by the Ayyubids, it had already become a pawn in the dynasty's power struggles. By &lt;a href=\"Al-Ashraf%20Musa%2C%20Emir%20of%20Damascus\"&gt;al-Ashraf&lt;/a&gt; had become resentful of his brother &lt;a href=\"al-Kamil\"&gt;al-Kamil&lt;/a&gt;'s ill-concealed ambition. al-Ashraf recruited the rulers of &lt;a href=\"Aleppo\"&gt;Aleppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Homs\"&gt;Homs&lt;/a&gt; to his faction and sent ambassadors to the court of &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Rum\"&gt;Rum Seljuk&lt;/a&gt; sultan &lt;a href=\"Kayqubad%20I\"&gt;'Al\u0101 ad-D\u012bn Kayqub\u0101d&lt;/a&gt; to propose an alliance. When they arrived at the Seljuk court they discovered that Kayqub\u0101d had died on 4 Shawwal 634/31 May 1237, and they now had to deal with his son, &lt;a href=\"Kaykhusraw%20II\"&gt;Ghiyath ad-Din Kaykhusrau II&lt;/a&gt;. The Middle East historian R. Stephen Humphreys speculates that Kaykhusrau was offered control of Amida and Hisn Kayfa in return for joining the alliance. Although al-Ashraf had assembled a formidable alliance against his brother, he was unable to use this to engage al-Kamil's forces as he was already ill by the time of the negotiations with the Seljuks, and he died on 4 Muharram 635/28 August 1237. His rival, al-Kamil, died on 6 March 1238, and the Ayyubid domain was thrown into fresh turmoil.\nAl-Kamil had bequeathed control of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mesopotamia\"&gt;the Jazira&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"as-Salih%20Ayyub\"&gt;as-Salih Ayyub&lt;/a&gt;, who had been emir of Hisn Kayfa, and named his younger brother &lt;a href=\"al-Adil%20II\"&gt;al-Adil&lt;/a&gt; as his heir in Egypt. In his new role as sultan, as-Salih Ayyub installed his own young son, &lt;a href=\"al-Muazzam%20Turanshah\"&gt;al-Muazzam Turanshah&lt;/a&gt; as prince of Hisn Kayfa in , with one of his closest advisers, Husam al-Din, as Turanshah's &lt;a href=\"atabeg\"&gt;atabeg&lt;/a&gt;. As-Salih Ayyub, meanwhile, gathered an army to take Damascus and challenge al-Adil's rule over Egypt. By June 1240 as-Salih Ayyub's soldiers had captured al-Adil and as-Salih became paramount ruler of the Ayyubid possessions.\nIt appears that as-Salih's son al-Muazzam Turanshah remained prince of Hisn Kayfa from 1238 until 1249. When as-Salih Ayyub died suddenly on 12 November 1249, Turanshah had to be recalled in a hurry to take control of the Ayyubid empire. As-Salih's widow, &lt;a href=\"Shajar%20al-Durr\"&gt;Shajar al-Durr&lt;/a&gt;, dispatched a special embassy to bring her son to Egypt. Turanshah had left Hisn Kayfa with this party by 18 December 1249, heading for &lt;a href=\"Anah\"&gt;Anah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Damascus\"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Al-Muwa%E1%B8%A5%E1%B8%A5id%20%CA%BFAbd%20All%C4%81h\"&gt;Al-Muwa\u1e25\u1e25id \u02bfAbd All\u0101h&lt;/a&gt; succeeded his father, Turanshah, as ruler of Hisn Kayfa. Although his father ruled Egypt for barely a year and was killed during the &lt;a href=\"Mamluk\"&gt;Mamluk&lt;/a&gt; takeover, al-Muwa\u1e25\u1e25id \u02bfAbd All\u0101h ruled Hisn Kayfa for more than three decades, from to , and was essentially the founder of the local Ayyubid dynasty. Although little remains standing from this prosperous period of the town's history, there is a detailed contemporary first-hand account by the topographer \u02bfIzz ad-D\u012bn Ibn Shadd\u0101d, whose last visit was in . He lists many buildings in the lower town, including a D\u0101r as-Sal\u1e6dana (near the bridge), a mosque, three &lt;a href=\"medrese\"&gt;medrese&lt;/a&gt;s, four &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20bath\"&gt;hammams&lt;/a&gt;, tombs, &lt;a href=\"caravanserai\"&gt;caravanserai&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bazaar\"&gt;bazaar&lt;/a&gt;s. At the citadel, Ibn Shadd\u0101d mentions another mosque, an open square, and fields to grow enough grain \"to feed the inhabitants from year to year\". The German historian of Islamic art &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Meinecke\"&gt;Michael Meinecke&lt;/a&gt; notes that almost none of the buildings that Ibn Shadd\u0101d describes can be identified in present-day Hasankeyf, and attributes that to neglect following the subsequent Mongol invasions and political instability.\nIn 1255, the great khan &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B6ngke\"&gt;M\u00f6ngke&lt;/a&gt; charged his brother &lt;a href=\"Hulagu\"&gt;Hulagu&lt;/a&gt; with leading a massive Mongol army to conquer or destroy the remaining Muslim states in southwestern Asia. Hulagu first besieged &lt;a href=\"Baghdad\"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, which was captured on 13 February 1258 and destroyed. He conquered &lt;a href=\"Aleppo\"&gt;Aleppo&lt;/a&gt; on 24 January 1260, and the &lt;a href=\"Nestorian\"&gt;Nestorian&lt;/a&gt; Christian Mongol general &lt;a href=\"Kitbuqa%20Noyan\"&gt;Kitbuqa Noyan&lt;/a&gt; took &lt;a href=\"Damascus\"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt; on 1 March. It seemed inevitable that all of the region's cities, including Hisn Kayfa, would fall to the Mongols, and indeed most of them did. Hulagu's plan appears to have been to proceed to Palestine and Egypt. But while he was in &lt;a href=\"Aleppo\"&gt;Aleppo&lt;/a&gt; in the spring of 1260, he received word that the great khan &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B6ngke%20Khan\"&gt;M\u00f6ngke&lt;/a&gt; had died the previous summer (on 11 August 1259). While Hulagu did not expect to succeed his elder brother, there was a struggle between two of his other brothers, &lt;a href=\"Kubilai\"&gt;Kubilai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ariq%20B%C3%B6ke\"&gt;Ariq B\u00f6ke&lt;/a&gt;, for control of the Mongol empire, and Hulagu decided it was wise to withdraw to &lt;a href=\"Tabriz\"&gt;Tabriz&lt;/a&gt; to await the resolution of this conflict.\nOn 23 Rabi\u02bf II 658/7 April 1260, &lt;a href=\"Mayafaraqin\"&gt;Mayafaraqin&lt;/a&gt; fell to Hulagu's forces, presumably during their retreat towards Ahlat and Tabriz, leaving &lt;a href=\"Mardin\"&gt;Mardin&lt;/a&gt; and Hisn Kayfa as the only cities outside his control in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mesopotamia\"&gt;the Jazira&lt;/a&gt;. Mardin was captured by the end of 1260, but Hisn Kayfa appears to have escaped a concerted assault because it controlled only a minor trade route and could simply be bypassed. Nevertheless, it seems that al-Muwa\u1e25\u1e25id decided to submit to being a Mongol vassal at about this time. While most of the &lt;a href=\"Diyar%20Bakr\"&gt;Diyar Bakr&lt;/a&gt; came under direct control of the Mongol governor or Mosul, both Ayyubid Hisn Kayfa and Artukid Mardin were allowed to remain as vassal states.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Mamluk\"&gt;Mamluk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Baybars\"&gt;Baybars&lt;/a&gt; was in power in Egypt, and represented the primary force opposing the Mongols, now led by Hulagu's son &lt;a href=\"Abaqa%20Khan\"&gt;Abaqa Khan&lt;/a&gt;. Baybars sent two eunuchs as emissaries to al-Muwa\u1e25\u1e25id to try to persuade him to abandon the Mongols, and apparently the emir of Hisn Kayfa agreed. However, the envoys were caught by a local Mongol commander as they attempted to carry al-Muwa\u1e25\u1e25id's reply to Baybars. Abaqa had the envoys executed, and al-Muwa\u1e25\u1e25id was banished to the &lt;a href=\"Orda%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Ilkhanate court&lt;/a&gt; for seven years. By al-Muwa\u1e25\u1e25id had returned as the nominal ruler of Hisn Kayfa, where he remained until his death, variously reported as having occurred in or .\nMongol rule of the region continued until 1335, and this badly damaged both trade and agriculture, which had been the sources of the region's prosperity. The impact was felt hardest between 1260 and 1315, and traders essentially avoided the region because of ongoing war between Mamluk and Mongol forces. In 1315, the &lt;a href=\"Il-Khanate\"&gt;Il-Khanate&lt;/a&gt; and the Mamluks signed a treaty and trade restarted. This proved to be a boon for Hisn Kayfa. The previous primary routes across the region\u2014through &lt;a href=\"Cizre\"&gt;Cizre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nusaybin\"&gt;Nusaybin&lt;/a&gt;, and through &lt;a href=\"Mayafaraqin\"&gt;Mayafaraqin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amida%20%28Mesopotamia%29\"&gt;Amida&lt;/a&gt; (Diyarbak\u0131r)\u2014both failed to attract many traders, and a new route from Iran to Aleppo through &lt;a href=\"Siirt\"&gt;Siirt&lt;/a&gt;, Hisn Kayfa and &lt;a href=\"Mardin\"&gt;Mardin&lt;/a&gt; took their place.\nThe economy of the region gradually shrank during the 14th and early 15th centuries, according to historian &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Alexander%20Sinclair\"&gt;Thomas Alexander Sinclair&lt;/a&gt;, but this probably did not cause any population decline in the cities of Mardin or Hisn Kayfa, where building continued uninterrupted. Several other cities in the region, such as &lt;a href=\"Mayafaraqin\"&gt;Mayafaraqin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tigranocerta\"&gt;Arzan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nusaybin\"&gt;Nusaybin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dara%20%28Mesopotamia%29\"&gt;Dara&lt;/a&gt; shrank or disappeared. After the breakup of the Ilkhanate, an &lt;a href=\"Artukid\"&gt;Artukid&lt;/a&gt; force waged war against the Ayyubids of Hisn Kayfa in 1334, but were decisively defeated, with the Ayyubids gaining their possessions on the left bank of the &lt;a href=\"Tigris%20River\"&gt;Tigris River&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 14th century, the emirs of Hisn Kayfa also controlled the interior of the &lt;a href=\"Tur%20Abdin\"&gt;Tur Abdin&lt;/a&gt; and the castle of &lt;a href=\"Haytham\"&gt;Haytham&lt;/a&gt; (in the Tur Abdin). In 1334/5 &lt;a href=\"al-Adil\"&gt;al-Adil&lt;/a&gt; Hisn Kayfa seized control over &lt;a href=\"Mayafaraqin\"&gt;Mayafaraqin&lt;/a&gt;, which probably had been governed by a Mongol vassal up to that time. Soon after, Al-Adil installed Zeyd, a Kurdish chief of the Zraki (or Zirki) tribe previously based at the castle of &lt;a href=\"Bo%C5%9Fat\"&gt;Bo\u015fat&lt;/a&gt; (the present-day village of Boyunlu, in &lt;a href=\"Silvan%2C%20Diyarbak%C4%B1r\"&gt;Silvan&lt;/a&gt; district), as his client ruler at Mayafaraqin. It seems that this was in payback for Zeyd's assistance in helping Hisn Kayfa repulse an attack by the Artuqid sultan of Mardin.\nThe Hisn Kayfa emirs also attacked and captured &lt;a href=\"Siirt\"&gt;Siirt&lt;/a&gt; soon after the Mongol withdrawal. They fought for control of Siirt with forces from Arzan, and &lt;a href=\"Al-Ashraf%20Musa%2C%20Emir%20of%20Damascus\"&gt;al-Ashraf&lt;/a&gt; of Hisn Kayfa succeeded in capturing it in 1341/42.\nIn 1349/50, the Kara Koyunlu rose to dominate the region of the Diyar Bakr, and local princes such as those at Hisn Kayfa, paid tribute to them. Also in 1349/50, the emir of Hisn Kayfa, &lt;a href=\"al-Adil\"&gt;al-Adil&lt;/a&gt;, attacked Azran, breaching its walls and destroying the town in order to get revenge on the local ruler. After this victory the town was abandoned and al-Adil bestowed control of the surrounding region on a Kurdish family.\nIn the early and middle 15th century, &lt;a href=\"Aq%20Qoyunlu\"&gt;Aq Qoyunlu&lt;/a&gt; Turkmen forces attacked Hisn Kayfa several times, but Ayyubid rulers managed to retain control of the city and the city prospered until very end of the 15th century.\nIn the 14th century, the Ayyubids rebuilt the castle of Hisn Kayfa which served as their stronghold as vassals of consecutively Mamluks and &lt;a href=\"Dulkadirids\"&gt;Dulkadirids&lt;/a&gt; until they were supplanted by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the early 16th century.\nAq Qoyunlu period (1462\u20131501).\nDuring the second half of the 15th century, Hisn Kayfa was still governed by the &lt;a href=\"Ayyubid%20dynasty%23Remnants%20of%20the%20dynasty\"&gt;last remaining Ayyubid dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, who owed allegiance to the Turkmen &lt;a href=\"Aq%20Qoyunlu\"&gt;Aq Qoyunlu&lt;/a&gt; confederation. The Aq Qoyunlu dynasty was headed by &lt;a href=\"Uzun%20Hassan\"&gt;Uzun Hassan&lt;/a&gt; from 1452 to 1478.\nUzun Hassan's initial capital was at &lt;a href=\"Amida%20%28Mesopotamia%29\"&gt;Amida&lt;/a&gt; (modern Diyarbak\u0131r), which he gained from his brother &lt;a href=\"Jihangir%20%28Aq%20Qoyunlu%20leader%29\"&gt;Jihangir&lt;/a&gt; in 1452. From there, Uzun Hassan embarked on a campaign of expanding his territory at the expense of the rival &lt;a href=\"Kara%20Koyunlu\"&gt;Kara Koyunlu&lt;/a&gt; dynasty. Hasankeyf was one of the first towns to acknowledge Uzun Hassan's &lt;a href=\"suzerainty\"&gt;suzerainty&lt;/a&gt;, in an agreement signed by the Ayyubid emir in 1455. While Uzun Hassan managed to extend his influence throughout much of the &lt;a href=\"Diyar%20Bakr\"&gt;Diyar Bakr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Mesopotamia%23Islamic%20empires\"&gt;Jazira&lt;/a&gt; during the 1450s, the Ayyubid emir of Hasankeyf rebelled in 1460, attempting to take control of &lt;a href=\"Siirt\"&gt;Siirt&lt;/a&gt;. Uzun Hassan responded by attacking Hasankeyf in 1461; he finally captured the town in 1462 after a six-month siege. It seems that Uzun Hassan then appointed his son Zeynel as governor of Hasankeyf.\nAq Qoyunlu territory expanded further following their defeat of the Kara Koyunlu in Iran (1467\u201369), and Uzun Hassan moved his capital to &lt;a href=\"Tabriz\"&gt;Tabriz&lt;/a&gt;. However, Hassan followed up these successes with a disastrous campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Hassan's army of light cavalry was routed by &lt;a href=\"Mehmed%20II\"&gt;Mehmed II&lt;/a&gt;'s Ottoman forces, armed with rifles and cannon, at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Otlukbeli\"&gt;Battle of Otlukbeli&lt;/a&gt; near Erzincan in August 1473. While Uzun Hassan survived, his son Zeynel Bey was killed in battle. In commemoration, the &lt;a href=\"Mausoleum%20of%20Zeynel%20Bey\"&gt;Mausoleum of Zeynel Bey&lt;/a&gt; was erected in Hasankeyf in about 1474 on the orders of either Uzun Hassan, or Zeynel's elder brother, Khalil. The shrine is currently moved to a new location to avoid inundation by the rising waters of the nearby dam.\nSafavid Empire (1504\u20131514/1517).\nIn 1504, during the reign of king (\"&lt;a href=\"shah\"&gt;shah&lt;/a&gt;\") &lt;a href=\"Ismail%20I\"&gt;Ismail I&lt;/a&gt; (1501\u20131525) the Safavids founded the short-lived &lt;a href=\"Safavid%20Diyarbakr\"&gt;Diyarbakr Province&lt;/a&gt;, which consisted of six districts, including Hasankeyf.\nOttoman Empire and Turkish Republic.\nIn 1514/1517, the Ottomans took Hasankeyf and the rest of the Safavid Diyarbakr Province. In his 1614 \"History of the World\", &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Raleigh\"&gt;Walter Raleigh&lt;/a&gt; places \"the Citie of \"Hasan-Cepha\", otherwise \"Fortis Petra\"\", upstream from the island of Eden, which he believed lay in the Tigris, based on his reading of &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Masius\"&gt;Andreas Masius&lt;/a&gt;'s \"De Paradiso Commentarius\".\nPopulation.\nThe current population of Hasankeyf is predominantly &lt;a href=\"Arabs\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt;, although residents speak &lt;a href=\"Kurdish%20languages\"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to their &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; mother tongue related to the Arabic spoken by &lt;a href=\"Bedouins\"&gt;Bedouins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Until the 1980s, &lt;a href=\"Assyrian/Syriac%20people\"&gt;Assyrians/Syriacs&lt;/a&gt; and Arab Christian families lived in the cave houses by the river. Many of these families immigrated to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; as the Turkish government's conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Kurdistan%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;PKK&lt;/a&gt; escalated during the 1980s. Arabic is still spoken in the city.\nArcheological sites.\nHasankeyf is rich in history throughout the ages and aside from the sites below, thousands of caves exist in the cliffs that surround the city. Many of the caves are multi-storied and have their own water supply. Churches and mosques were also carved into the cliffs and numerous ancient cemeteries exist throughout the area.\nIl\u0131su Dam impact.\nWith its history that spans nine civilizations, the archaeological and religious significance of Hasankeyf is considerable. Some of the city's historical treasures are soon to be inundated as construction of the &lt;a href=\"Il%C4%B1su%20Dam\"&gt;Il\u0131su Dam&lt;/a&gt; is completed. These include the ornate &lt;a href=\"mosque\"&gt;mosque&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"tomb\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt;s and cave &lt;a href=\"Church%20%28building%29\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;es. Up to 80,000 people in Hasankeyf are being displaced. Some of these people are being moved to a new city above the waterline.\nThere has been considerable local opposition to the scheme, and calls for Hasankeyf to be recognised and protected as an UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Bu%C4%9Fday%20Association\"&gt;Bu\u011fday Association&lt;/a&gt;, based in Turkey, Ms. &lt;a href=\"Huriye%20K%C3%BCpeli\"&gt;Huriye K\u00fcpeli&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"prefect\"&gt;prefect&lt;/a&gt; of Hasankeyf, the &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; ambassador to Turkey and representatives of the Swiss led consortium of contractors for the dam project have suggested what they believe to be a suitable nearby spot for moving the historical heritage of Hasankeyf, an operation for which the Turkish Ministry of Culture pledged to provide 30 million euros, however current reports indicate that only eight historical monuments have been moved.\nThe threat of the Il\u0131su Dam project prompted the &lt;a href=\"World%20Monuments%20Fund\"&gt;World Monuments Fund&lt;/a&gt; to list the city on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world. While this listing has created more awareness of the project, it has failed to prompt the Il\u0131su Consortium to develop alternate plans that are sympathetic to this site of exceptional historical and cultural significance.\nIn December 2008, following pressure from campaign groups, export credit insurers in &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; announced suspending their support for the project amid concern about its environmental and cultural impact and gave the Turkish government 180 days to meet standards set by the &lt;a href=\"World%20Bank\"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;. These standards were 153 requirements on environmental protection, resettlement of villages, protection of cultural heritage, and resource management with neighbouring states. As Turkey did not fulfil any of them, the three ECAs indicated in a joint press release issued on 7 July 2009 that they withdrew from the project. Shortly after, in another joint press release issued on the same day, the three banks (&lt;a href=\"Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale\"&gt;Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UniCredit\"&gt;UniCredit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DekaBank%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;DekaBank&lt;/a&gt;) financing the Il\u0131su Dam project also stated \u2013 in line with the decision of the ECAs \u2013 that the export credit granted by the three banks for the construction of the Il\u0131su Dam would no longer be available.\nThis meant that Turkey has had to finance the proposed project with internal sources. The Minister of Forestry and Environment, &lt;a href=\"Veysel%20Ero%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Veysel Ero\u011flu&lt;/a&gt;, on a number of platforms, declared that the government would build the Dam despite all obstacles - and objections. That the Il\u0131su Dam has become a \"project of honour\" for the Turkish State has been made very clear by Ero\u011flu. \"We do not need their money. We will construct this dam at any cost.\" Since 2009 the construction has proceeded with the financial support of Turkish banks; &lt;a href=\"Garanti%20BBVA\"&gt;Garanti Bankas\u0131&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akbank\"&gt;Akbank&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the resettlement program for the population, many residents of Hasankeyf moved to a \"Yeni Hasankeyf\" (New Hasankeyf) on a hill which was to be at the shore of the &lt;a href=\"dam\"&gt;dam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"reservoir\"&gt;reservoir&lt;/a&gt; after the construction of the dam is terminated. By July 2020, the ancient town was completely submerged in the waters of the dam.\nClimate.\nThe local climate is moderated by the proximity of the &lt;a href=\"Tigris\"&gt;Tigris&lt;/a&gt; river. It makes the winters milder, with lows of . Temperatures in summer can reach , and the yearly average temperature is ."
