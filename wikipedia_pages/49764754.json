It is a single-story L-shaped structure, with three service bays set at different angles, and an office in front. A zigzag pattern of black tiles extends across the building's &lt;a href=\"cornice\"&gt;cornice&lt;/a&gt;, and black tile is used prominently around the main entrance and below the office windows.\nThe building was listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 2000."
