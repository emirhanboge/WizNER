It is located in \"Camp Red\u00f3\" neighborhood of the city, was founded in 1965 and is one of the oldest clubs in the capital.\nThe team plays in &lt;a href=\"Divisiones%20Regionales%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20in%20Balearic%20Islands\"&gt;Primera Regional Mallorca&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20football%20league\"&gt;Spanish football league&lt;/a&gt;, sixth level of Spanish football.\nHistory.\nThe origins go back to the founding of \"Club Deportivo Nidda\" in 1965. Initially, the club adopted the name of its social premises: the \"Bar Nidda\", located in the same neighborhood. In 1967 the club was re-established and adopted the current name.\nSince its inception, the club played in regional categories in &lt;a href=\"Mallorca\"&gt;Mallorca&lt;/a&gt; and gradually moved up one category. The first years played alternately in \"Primera Regional\" (for not descending) or \"Segunda Regional\". In mid &lt;a href=\"90s\"&gt;90s&lt;/a&gt; it took a qualitative leap and reached the &lt;a href=\"Divisiones%20Regionales%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20in%20Balearic%20Islands\"&gt;Regional Preferente&lt;/a&gt;, also as a lift team between it and \"Primera Regional\".\nAt the beginning of XXI century the club lived its best years. In 2008-09 season played the qualifying rounds for promotion to &lt;a href=\"Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Tercera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; and achieved promotion. But his journey in &lt;a href=\"Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Tercera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%23Group%20XI%20%E2%80%93%20Balearic%20Islands\"&gt;2009-10 season&lt;/a&gt;) was not good, and decreased that same season and returned to be a regular player in \"Regional Preferente\". It drop to \"Primera regional\" for the 2015-16 season, largely due to the poor condition of its stadium. After a year promoted to \"Regional Preferente\", where it was during two seasons and was relegated again to \"Primera Regional\", where plays actually.\nStadium.\n\"La Antoniana\" was inaugurated on 1 January 1935, with a capacity of 300 seats. The surface of the playing field is artificial grass and has a size of 98 x 65 meters. The team has played the matches since its inception.\nThis is the oldest football field in the city (inaugurated in 1935). For some years it was the only ground stadium in the city (and in poor condition), which influenced results of team and its lower categories.\nAfter years of waiting, in May 2017 the renovation works for the installation of artificial grass were carried out. On &lt;a href=\"19%20June\"&gt;19 June&lt;/a&gt; of the same year the new facilities were inaugurated.\nWomen's team.\nThe club has a &lt;a href=\"SCD%20Independiente%20%28women%29\"&gt;women's section&lt;/a&gt;. This was set up in 1999-2000 season and has since competed without interruption, becoming one of most veteran clubs in competition in &lt;a href=\"Balearic%20Islands\"&gt;Balearic Islands&lt;/a&gt;."
