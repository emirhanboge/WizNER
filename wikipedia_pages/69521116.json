    "text": "The 2022 Italy v Argentina football match is an upcoming competitive &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; match between the winners of &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2020&lt;/a&gt; (held in 2021), &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, and the winners of the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. The match, acting as an intercontinental &lt;a href=\"super%20cup\"&gt;super cup&lt;/a&gt;, will be held in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, England, on 1 June 2022. It is being organised by &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CONMEBOL\"&gt;CONMEBOL&lt;/a&gt;, as part of a renewed parternship between the two organisations. The match has also been referred to as a \"Grand Final\" (, ).\nBackground.\nIn 1985 and 1993, the winners of the prior &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20European%20Championship\"&gt;UEFA European Championship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt; tournaments played in the &lt;a href=\"Artemio%20Franchi%20Trophy\"&gt;Artemio Franchi Trophy&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the European/South American Nations Cup), a one-off match organised by &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CONMEBOL\"&gt;CONMEBOL&lt;/a&gt;. It was the national team equivalent to the &lt;a href=\"Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29\"&gt;Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt; on the club level, played between the winners of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup/UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Libertadores\"&gt;Copa Libertadores&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; won the 1985 edition in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; won the 1993 match in &lt;a href=\"Mar%20del%20Plata\"&gt;Mar del Plata&lt;/a&gt;. However, the competition was discontinued thereafter. The Artemio Franchi Trophy can be considered a precursor of the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;King Fahd Cup/FIFA Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt;, played in 1992 for the first time and organised by &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; from 1997, which featured the title holders of the continental championships and &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"2017%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup\"&gt;2017 FIFA Confederations Cup&lt;/a&gt;, FIFA announced on 15 March 2019 that the tournament would be abolished.\nOn 12 February 2020, UEFA and CONMEBOL signed a renewed &lt;a href=\"memorandum%20of%20understanding\"&gt;memorandum of understanding&lt;/a&gt; meant to enhance cooperation between the two organisations. As part of the agreement, a joint UEFA\u2013CONMEBOL committee examined the possibility of staging European\u2013South American intercontinental matches, for both men's and women's football and across various age groups. On 28 September 2021, UEFA and CONMEBOL confirmed that the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20European%20Championship\"&gt;UEFA European Championship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt; winners would face each other in an intercontinental match, with the agreement initially covering three editions starting in 2022. The first edition was confirmed to take place during the June 2022 &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20International%20Match%20Calendar\"&gt;international window&lt;/a&gt; at a venue to be confirmed. On 15 December 2021, UEFA and CONMEBOL again signed a renewed memorandum of understanding lasting until 2028, which included specific provisions on opening a joint office in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and the potential organisation of various football events. The match was confirmed to take place in London on 1 June 2022, with the venue yet to be decided.\nTeams.\n&lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; qualified for the match by virtue of winning &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2020&lt;/a&gt;, having defeated &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; on penalties in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; for their second &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20European%20Championship\"&gt;UEFA European Championship&lt;/a&gt; title. &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; qualified by winning the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt;, defeating &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; for a record-equalling 15th &lt;a href=\"Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica\"&gt;Copa Am\u00e9rica&lt;/a&gt; title, their first trophy in 28 years."
