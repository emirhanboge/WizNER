    "text": "Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery is a &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; cemetery built by the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission\"&gt;Commonwealth War Graves Commission&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Fromelles\"&gt;Fromelles&lt;/a&gt; in northern France, near the Belgian border. Constructed between 2009 and 2010, it was the first new Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery for more than 50 years, the last such cemeteries having been built after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;. The cemetery contains the graves of 250 British and Australian soldiers who died on 19 July 1916 in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Fromelles\"&gt;Battle of Fromelles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bodies were discovered following historical research that included analysis of &lt;a href=\"aerial%20photograph\"&gt;aerial photograph&lt;/a&gt;s showing the presence of &lt;a href=\"mass%20grave\"&gt;mass grave&lt;/a&gt;s on the edge of Pheasant Wood (\"Bois Faisan\"), just outside the village of Fromelles. The presence of the bodies was confirmed in May 2008, and the bodies were recovered during &lt;a href=\"battlefield%20archaeology\"&gt;excavation work&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. A specially convened Identification Board published a report on 17 March 2010 announcing the first 75 bodies to have been successfully identified using &lt;a href=\"DNA%20profiling\"&gt;DNA analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Further identification continued until at least 2014.\nIn parallel with the recovery and identification projects, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission was asked by the &lt;a href=\"British%20government\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australian%20government\"&gt;Australian government&lt;/a&gt;s to construct a new cemetery to house the bodies. Building work on the cemetery began in May 2009, and the main structural elements were completed by January 2010. The dead soldiers were reburied with &lt;a href=\"military%20funeral\"&gt;full military honours&lt;/a&gt; in a series of funeral services in January and February 2010. The ceremonial first reburial took place on 30 January 2010.\nFollowing this period of reburials, topsoil was added to the cemetery, and the &lt;a href=\"landscape%20gardening\"&gt;horticultural elements&lt;/a&gt; planted and allowed to grow into place. One final reburial took place as part of the cemetery's &lt;a href=\"dedication\"&gt;dedication&lt;/a&gt; ceremony, which was held on 19 July 2010 to mark the 94th anniversary of the Battle of Fromelles.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Fromelles\"&gt;Battle of Fromelles&lt;/a&gt; took place on the night of 19\u201320 July 1916, during the &lt;a href=\"Somme%20Offensive\"&gt;Somme Offensive&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;. It was a diversionary battle, intended to draw the attention of the Germans away from the larger attacks elsewhere. It involved units of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%205th%20Division\"&gt;Australian 5th Division&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"British%2061st%20Division\"&gt;British 61st Division&lt;/a&gt; attacking German positions in and around Fromelles. The German positions were well defended, and the battle led to huge losses by the attacking forces, with particularly heavy losses incurred by the &lt;a href=\"15th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Australian 15th Brigade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"British%20184th%20Brigade\"&gt;British 184th Brigade&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first major battle on the Western Front involving the &lt;a href=\"First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force\"&gt;First Australian Imperial Force&lt;/a&gt; (AIF), and has been described as \"the worst 24 hours in Australia's entire history.\"\nRecords kept by the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission\"&gt;Commonwealth War Graves Commission&lt;/a&gt; show that 1,780 Australian soldiers and 503 British soldiers died in the battle, but many of these bodies were not recovered. These missing dead are commemorated not by individual graves and names on headstones, but by names carved on &lt;a href=\"war%20memorial\"&gt;memorials&lt;/a&gt; dedicated for that purpose. The Australian missing dead from the battle are inscribed on the memorial at the &lt;a href=\"V.C.%20Corner%20Australian%20Cemetery%20and%20Memorial\"&gt;V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, and over 400 unidentified bodies from the battle are also buried there. Many of the dead were recovered by German forces after the battle and buried behind German lines. Some of these burial sites were located in the years immediately following the First World War, and the bodies were reburied in cemeteries in the area, including the V.C. Corner Cemetery.\nDiscovery of mass graves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mass%20grave\"&gt;burial pits&lt;/a&gt; at Pheasant Wood remained undisturbed for over 90 years. Their existence was discovered following research by retired Australian teacher Lambis Englezos. Following a visit to Fromelles in 2002, Englezos calculated a discrepancy in the numbers of unidentified Fromelles burials when compared to the lists of the missing. Following up on this, he investigated the possibility that the missing bodies had been buried in unmarked mass graves by the Germans, and never recovered since. In May 2006, &lt;a href=\"60%20Minutes%20%28Australian%20TV%20program%29\"&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Martin%20%28television%20presenter%29\"&gt;Ray Martin&lt;/a&gt; and producer &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Rice%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;Stephen Rice&lt;/a&gt; began an investigation of Englezos's theories and visited Fromelles to examine his evidence. In July 2006 they broadcast a report supporting his findings and demanding action by the Federal Government.\nSeveral years of historical research, including examination of &lt;a href=\"aerial%20photograph\"&gt;aerial photograph&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Cross\"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; records, and German war records, led to the convening of an &lt;a href=\"Army%20History%20Unit\"&gt;Army History Unit&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, and submissions to the &lt;a href=\"All-Party%20Parliamentary%20War%20Graves%20and%20Battlefield%20Heritage%20Group\"&gt;All-Party Parliamentary War Graves and Battlefield Heritage Group&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. The evidence eventually became strong enough that an official investigation was ordered.\nAn &lt;a href=\"battlefield%20archaeology\"&gt;archaeological evaluation&lt;/a&gt; of the suspected burial sites was carried out in May 2008 by the &lt;a href=\"Glasgow%20University%20Archaeological%20Research%20Division\"&gt;Glasgow University Archaeological Research Division&lt;/a&gt; (GUARD). This limited survey and excavation confirmed that the sites contained the bodies of British and Australian soldiers from the First World War, and this led to the funding of a larger project to fully excavate the site. The main excavation was carried out by &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20Archaeology\"&gt;Oxford Archaeology&lt;/a&gt; from May to September 2009, and resulted in the recovery of 250 British and Australian bodies from five mass graves, and some 6,200 individual artefacts. Appeals have been made for relatives of soldiers known to have died in the battle to come forward, and &lt;a href=\"DNA%20profiling\"&gt;DNA analysis&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"LGC%20Forensics\"&gt;LGC Forensics&lt;/a&gt; is being carried out in an attempt to identify the bodies.\nPlanning.\nFollowing the discovery of the mass graves at Pheasant Wood in May 2008, the British and Australian governments set up a jointly funded body, the &lt;a href=\"Fromelles%20Management%20Board\"&gt;Fromelles Management Board&lt;/a&gt; (FMB), to achieve three main aims: to recover, identify, and re-inter the bodies. The FMB would co-ordinate between multiple French, British and Australian organisations, and provide overall supervision for the project. Although the British and Australian governments, through the FMB, retained overall responsibility, the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission\"&gt;Commonwealth War Graves Commission&lt;/a&gt; (CWGC) was asked to act as their agent and provide day-to-day project management, with the Fromelles Project Manager, provided by the CWGC, also being a member of the Board.\nIn addition to providing management for the project, the CWGC was asked to construct a new &lt;a href=\"cemetery\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt; for the reburial of the bodies that would be recovered. Although asked to do this by the British and Australian governments, the design, construction and maintenance of such cemeteries is part of the central remit of the CWGC, and as such the estimated 900,000\u00a0&lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s construction cost was covered by funding from CWGC member countries. The funding for the excavations, DNA analysis, and reburial ceremonies, was shared equally by the British and Australian governments.\nThe plans and designs for the new cemetery were drawn up by the commission's architect, Barry Edwards. One of the immediate problems faced was deciding on a suitable location. The original location of the mass graves was considered as a site for the cemetery (and was offered as such by the landowner), but the ground was found to be too prone to flooding. The site that was chosen was nearby, about 120\u00a0metres to the southwest of the original battlefield mass graves, but on a higher piece of land just outside the village of Fromelles. The overall cemetery shape is hexagonal, and the design incorporated radial rows of headstones leading towards a raised &lt;a href=\"Cross%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Cross of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; on the southern side of the cemetery. This higher location for the cemetery allowed the deliberate placement of the Cross of Sacrifice at a place where it would be visible on the skyline when viewed from the nearby &lt;a href=\"V.C.%20Corner%20Australian%20Cemetery%20and%20Memorial\"&gt;V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial&lt;/a&gt;. This memorial is one of several locations in and around Fromelles where those who fell in the battle are commemorated. The Fromelles battlefield of 1916 would also be visible from the elevated Cross of Sacrifice terrace. Another consideration in the design was the cemetery orientation, with the headstones orientated to the south to avoid shadows and to increase the daytime visibility of the headstone inscriptions. The exact layout of the burial plots was left flexible as the number of burials needed was not known at that point. A small car park was included in the design. Unlike earlier CWGC cemeteries, this modern cemetery was designed to include ramps to allow &lt;a href=\"accessibility\"&gt;accessibility&lt;/a&gt; for wheelchair users.\nThe CWGC plans for the new cemetery were made public in April 2009 and announced by the commission's Director-General, Richard Kellaway, who stated a desire that the cemetery would be worthy of the sacrifices made by those who would be buried there, and that it would become \"a place of dignified pilgrimage and remembrance for generations to come.\"\nIn September 2009, a report was published by the Fromelles Management Board ('Fromelles \u2013 the story so far'). Written by the Board co-Chairs from the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Ministry%20of%20Defence\"&gt;UK Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Defence%20Force\"&gt;Australian Defence Force&lt;/a&gt;, the report stated that the object of the project is \"the dignified recovery of the remains of those soldiers who have lain in the field at Pheasant Wood for the last 93 years so as to provide them the same courtesies that were extended to their colleagues when the battlefields were cleared at the end of the War \u2013 an individual burial with military honours and their name on their headstone where ever possible.\"\nConstruction.\nThe cemetery construction contract was awarded to &lt;a href=\"Beton-Bouw%20Bentein\"&gt;Beton-Bouw Bentein&lt;/a&gt; BVBA. This company, which was founded in 1921, helped to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; after the war, and had previous experience working with the commission.&lt;ref name=\"CWGC PR 05/09\"&gt;'Work starts on new war cemetery', Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Maidenhead, UK, 28 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Before construction could begin, the area had to be checked by the French authorities for ordnance and other &lt;a href=\"materiel\"&gt;materiel&lt;/a&gt; left from the war. This was done in April 2009, and though no &lt;a href=\"Iron%20harvest\"&gt;unexploded munitions&lt;/a&gt; were found, other wartime debris was cleared from the area, including barbed wire and shell cases. Construction proper began in May 2009, with the site being levelled in preparation for the laying of the foundations, while temporary hoardings were put up to enclose the site.\nAlthough access to the main construction and excavation sites was restricted by this point, there was still great interest shown, with visits both by the media, and by schoolchildren and relatives of those who had died at Fromelles. Information was displayed at the site on display boards, and &lt;a href=\"commemorative%20plaque\"&gt;commemorative plaque&lt;/a&gt;s were also installed. Artworks on the theme of '&lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;', drawn and painted by schoolchildren from the UK, France and Australia, were installed on aluminium panels on the hoardings. The artwork from the UK came from the &lt;a href=\"Year%207\"&gt;Year 7&lt;/a&gt; schoolchildren from &lt;a href=\"Stonyhurst%20St%20Mary%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Stonyhurst St Mary's Hall&lt;/a&gt;, Lancashire, and in June 2009, they travelled to Fromelles to visit the site and see their artwork on display.\nThe geology of the site, a former farmer's field on a slight slope, with a heavy &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; soil that is subject to seasonal movements when wet, meant that substantial &lt;a href=\"Foundation%20%28engineering%29\"&gt;foundations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drainage\"&gt;drainage&lt;/a&gt; had to be constructed. The main support for the above ground structures consists of 210 concrete &lt;a href=\"Deep%20foundation\"&gt;piles&lt;/a&gt; extending vertically downwards into the soil, each up to 7 metres deep. These pilings were engineered in June 2009 by a specialist company, &lt;a href=\"Wig-Palen\"&gt;Wig-Palen&lt;/a&gt;, from Belgium, using a 62-ton machine to drill and compact the required holes. Concrete was then poured into the hollow drill to fill the void as the drill was extracted, and &lt;a href=\"reinforced%20concrete\"&gt;steel reinforcement cages&lt;/a&gt; were then placed into the still-wet concrete. This screw-piling technique ensured that the cemetery foundations were both end-bearing and friction-bearing in nature, increasing the stability of the pilings and the structures they support.\nBy July 2009, work was being done on carving the &lt;a href=\"headstone\"&gt;headstone&lt;/a&gt;s. A supply of the traditional &lt;a href=\"Portland%20Stone\"&gt;Portland Stone&lt;/a&gt; (Broadcroft Whitbed) was reserved, and blank headstones shaped and shipped to France. Carving of the headstones was done using the commission's computer-controlled &lt;a href=\"Incisograph\"&gt;Incisograph&lt;/a&gt; system. Also that month, planning and cultivation had started for the plants to be used in the new cemetery. Many months would be needed to develop and prune the plants in pots so they would be ready to transplant in the Spring of 2010, in preparation for the opening ceremony that July. The limited time between the planned reburials in February 2010, and the opening of the cemetery, meant that the grassed areas would need to be &lt;a href=\"Sod\"&gt;turfed&lt;/a&gt;, instead of growing the grass from seeds. The &lt;a href=\"rose\"&gt;rose&lt;/a&gt;s used are the 'Remembrance' &lt;a href=\"cultivar\"&gt;cultivar&lt;/a&gt;, one often used in Commission cemeteries.\nIn August 2009, work began on the construction of the cemetery boundary walls. Horizontal reinforced-concrete &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28structure%29\"&gt;beams&lt;/a&gt;, laid down below ground, provided a foundation for the stepped boundary walls, built using brick. Like all the foundations laid here, the concrete beams were encased in a &lt;a href=\"polystyrene\"&gt;polystyrene&lt;/a&gt; casing to allow for expansion and contraction of the soil. Heavy rain during August delayed the construction work, but in September and October, a period of fine dry weather allowed progress to be made on the most complex part of the project, the &lt;a href=\"Cross%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Cross of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; and its terrace and foundations.\nThe size of the Cross of Sacrifice, a standard Commission structure used for cemeteries with over 40 graves, varies according to the number of burials in a cemetery. For this cemetery, a Type-A Cross, around 4 metres wide at the base and 6 metres high, would be used. Carved from &lt;a href=\"Massangies\"&gt;Massangies&lt;/a&gt;, a French &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;, the shaft of the cross alone would weigh four tonnes, while the entire raised stone terrace would weigh many more tonnes. To support the weight of the Cross and the raised terrace on which it would stand, special foundations of twenty-six vertical 7-metre deep concrete piles were prepared, each capable of supporting ten tonnes, four of which would support the Cross itself. A connecting network was also built between the piles to ensure the load was spread evenly. The raised terrace includes ramps to allow access by wheelchair, and &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt;s for flower displays.\nThe system of &lt;a href=\"Pier%20and%20beam%20foundation\"&gt;underground piles and beams&lt;/a&gt; that has been constructed not only supports the cemetery walls and the Cross of Sacrifice terrace, but also supports the graves and headstones as well. Each headstone is installed in an individual base, which is supported by horizontal ground beams, which rests on the vertical piles. All this is needed to isolate the cemetery structures from &lt;a href=\"ground%20movement\"&gt;ground movement&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCarving of the Cross of Sacrifice started in October 2009, and the same month the stonework for the terrace and the base of the cross was laid, and excavations took place to prepare the &lt;a href=\"burial%20plot\"&gt;burial plot&lt;/a&gt;s. Several feet of soil were removed across much of the cemetery area and replaced with limestone &lt;a href=\"Construction%20aggregate\"&gt;aggregate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;. These materials drain more easily than the clay soil, and provide a solid surface for the &lt;a href=\"Pallbearer\"&gt;burial parties&lt;/a&gt; to stand on. The actual burials involved the coffins being lowered into wooden &lt;a href=\"sarcophagus\"&gt;sarcophagi&lt;/a&gt; that were installed at this point in the construction process. Following the February 2010 burials, the headstones were installed, and the limestone and gravel layer covered with &lt;a href=\"topsoil\"&gt;topsoil&lt;/a&gt; and turfed with grass. Finally, the plants were added and allowed to &lt;a href=\"Bedding%20%28horticulture%29\"&gt;bed in&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"dedication\"&gt;dedication&lt;/a&gt; ceremony in July.\nBurials.\nFollowing their recovery, the remains of the 250 British and Australian soldiers were stored in temporary &lt;a href=\"mortuary\"&gt;mortuary&lt;/a&gt; facilities. Since any possible identification would take many months, it was decided to carry out the reburials as soon as the cemetery was ready, and use temporary headstones. Following the report of the Identification Board, in March 2010, permanent headstones were installed. The headstones include any names and nationalities that it has been possible to ascertain using historical, &lt;a href=\"anthropological\"&gt;anthropological&lt;/a&gt;, archaeological and &lt;a href=\"DNA\"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; evidence, but where the identity is unknown the carved inscription on the headstone will simply read \"Known Unto God\", the standard phrase used for the headstones of &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier\"&gt;unknown soldiers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe inaugural reburial and ceremony took place at 11\u00a0am local time on 30 January 2010, with around 400 people watching from the viewing areas outside the cemetery walls. The cemetery grounds were covered with a light dusting of snow. Orders of service were available in English and French, and the ceremony was attended by representatives from &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"UK\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission\"&gt;Commonwealth War Graves Commission&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom paid tribute to the fallen. Representing the UK government was &lt;a href=\"Kevan%20Jones\"&gt;Kevan Jones&lt;/a&gt;, the Veterans Minister. Representing Australia was &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Griffin%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Alan Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20for%20Veterans%27%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Minister for Veterans' Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, while from the French military was the former Chief of Defence of the French Army, Bruno Cuche. In his speech, General Cuche paid tribute to the sacrifice made by the young soldiers that fought in the battle:\nThe gun salute was fired by soldiers from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Regiment%20of%20Fusiliers\"&gt;Royal Regiment of Fusiliers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Army\"&gt;Australian Army&lt;/a&gt;. A guard of honour was formed by forty French veterans, each carrying a flag representing a town or village in the Lille area, with the flag for Fromelles itself dating from 1914. The pallbearers were from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Regiment%20of%20Fusiliers\"&gt;Royal Regiment of Fusiliers&lt;/a&gt;, and standard bearers from the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20British%20Legion\"&gt;Royal British Legion&lt;/a&gt; were also present.\nFollowing the ceremony, a reception was hosted by the Mayor, Hubert Huchette, and the people of Fromelles.\nThe remainder of the reburials, with the exception of one reserved for the dedication ceremony in July, took place in February 2010. The reburials, starting on 1 February, took place on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, starting at 9\u00a0am, with up to thirty soldiers being &lt;a href=\"Burial\"&gt;re-interred&lt;/a&gt; each day, all with full military honours. There is a viewing area from which the &lt;a href=\"military%20funeral\"&gt;military funeral&lt;/a&gt;s can be observed, and an area to leave &lt;a href=\"wreath\"&gt;tributes&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, there were public displays at Fromelles Town Hall (&lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;Mairie&lt;/a&gt;) and at the recovery location, and a Book of Remembrance is available to sign.\nEach day of reburials opened with a &lt;a href=\"military%20parade\"&gt;parade&lt;/a&gt; where a ceremonial guard oversaw the raising of the &lt;a href=\"British%20flag\"&gt;Union&lt;/a&gt; (British), &lt;a href=\"Australian%20flag\"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"French%20flag\"&gt;French flag&lt;/a&gt;s. Following a &lt;a href=\"blessing\"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"military%20chaplain\"&gt;military chaplain&lt;/a&gt;s, the flags were lowered to &lt;a href=\"half-staff\"&gt;half-staff&lt;/a&gt;, and the reburials began. Each funeral followed the same standard pattern used for the inaugural reburial, but were carried out in pairs to reflect the joint British-Australian nature of the battle. A bearer party conveyed each coffin from a hearse to the designated burial plot, and the chaplain conducted the &lt;a href=\"funeral%20service\"&gt;funeral service&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the day, the chaplain said a &lt;a href=\"prayer\"&gt;prayer&lt;/a&gt;, military &lt;a href=\"collect\"&gt;collect&lt;/a&gt;s were read out by Australian and British soldiers, and a soldier recited the Exhortation from the \"&lt;a href=\"Ode%20of%20Remembrance\"&gt;Ode of Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"They shall grow not old\u00a0... We will remember them\"). Following this, a firing party fired &lt;a href=\"3-volley%20salute\"&gt;three volleys&lt;/a&gt;, a trumpeter sounded the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Post\"&gt;Last Post&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Moment%20of%20silence\"&gt;one-minute silence&lt;/a&gt; was held. The silence was broken by the trumpeter sounding &lt;a href=\"Reveille\"&gt;Reveille&lt;/a&gt;, the chaplain then read a final blessing, the flags were raised back to full-staff and then re-lowered and removed, and the parade marched off.\nCare has been taken over the allocation of the burial plots, with the position of each body in the mass graves recorded to ensure that the soldiers who lay side by side at Pheasant Wood for ninety-three years will be buried in adjacent plots in their final resting place.\nIdentifications.\nIdentifications of the reinterred in the cemetery were first announced by the Australians and British on 17 March 2010. Of these, were identified by name, were found to be Australian, three were British, and unidentified. An identity board was held in May 2010 and further boards annually until 2014. On 7 May 2010 Australian news sources reported that a further soldiers had been identified, with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Age\"&gt;The Age&lt;/a&gt;\" stating that no further British casualties had been identified. Two identifications were announced on 7 July 2010, one being Lieutenant-Colonel Ignatius Bertram Norris, who commanded &lt;a href=\"53rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;53rd Battalion&lt;/a&gt; in the attack on 19 July 1916.
