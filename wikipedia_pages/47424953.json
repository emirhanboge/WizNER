    "text": "Dongjun 434 class &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt; is a class of little known naval &lt;a href=\"auxiliary%20ship\"&gt;auxiliary ship&lt;/a&gt; currently in service with the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Liberation%20Army%20Navy\"&gt;People's Liberation Army Navy&lt;/a&gt; (PLAN). The name of this class is after the first unit commissioned, with the exact type still remains unknown, and only a single unit of this class have been confirmed in active service as of mid-2010s. Dongjun 434 is one of the few Chinese naval ships made by western countries, and it is built by &lt;a href=\"DEMAG\"&gt;DEMAG&lt;/a&gt;.\nDongjun 434 class series ships in PLAN service are designated by a combination of two Chinese characters followed by three-digit number. The second Chinese character is Jun (\u6d5a), meaning dredge in Chinese, because these ships are classified as &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt;s. The first Chinese character denotes which fleet the ship is service with, with East (Dong, \u4e1c) for &lt;a href=\"East%20Sea%20Fleet\"&gt;East Sea Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, North (Bei, \u5317) for &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20Fleet\"&gt;North Sea Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, and South (Nan, \u5357) for &lt;a href=\"South%20Sea%20Fleet\"&gt;South Sea Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. However, the pennant numbers may have changed due to the change of Chinese naval ships naming convention."
