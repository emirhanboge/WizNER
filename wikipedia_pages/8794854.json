    "text": "The Tamperer featuring Maya was an Italian &lt;a href=\"dance%20music\"&gt;dance music&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"musical%20ensemble\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; consisting of Italian &lt;a href=\"record%20producer\"&gt;record producer&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Fargetta\"&gt;Mario Fargetta&lt;/a&gt; and Alex Farolfi, and American &lt;a href=\"singing\"&gt;singer&lt;/a&gt; Maya Days. Later, Giuliano Saglia and GianLuca Mensi would join the project. It achieved European success in 1998 with the chart-topping single \"&lt;a href=\"Feel%20It%20%28The%20Tamperer%20featuring%20Maya%20song%29\"&gt;Feel It&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOverview.\nIn 1998, the group became famous for its debut &lt;a href=\"single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Feel%20It%20%28The%20Tamperer%20featuring%20Maya%20song%29\"&gt;Feel It&lt;/a&gt;\", which peaked at No. 1 in both &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in May of that year and was taken from the &lt;a href=\"album\"&gt;album&lt;/a&gt; \"Fabulous\". This song was &lt;a href=\"songwriter\"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; by the American team of Steve Gittelman and Jim Dyke, and relied heavily on a &lt;a href=\"sampling%20%28music%29\"&gt;sample&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jackson%205\"&gt;Jacksons&lt;/a&gt; hit \"&lt;a href=\"Can%20You%20Feel%20It%20%28The%20Jacksons%20song%29\"&gt;Can You Feel It&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe album spawned two more singles, \"&lt;a href=\"If%20You%20Buy%20This%20Record%20%28Your%20Life%20Will%20Be%20Better%29\"&gt;If You Buy This Record (Your Life Will Be Better)&lt;/a&gt;\" (based on a sample from &lt;a href=\"Madonna%20%28entertainer%29\"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Material%20Girl\"&gt;Material Girl&lt;/a&gt;\"), and the Italy-only release \"Step Out\". The group returned in early 2000 to release its next (and final) single, \"&lt;a href=\"Hammer%20to%20the%20Heart\"&gt;Hammer to the Heart&lt;/a&gt;\" (based on &lt;a href=\"ABBA\"&gt;ABBA&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Gimme%21%20Gimme%21%20Gimme%21%20%28A%20Man%20After%20Midnight%29\"&gt;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&lt;/a&gt;\"). This became a success also, where it became the group's third top-ten hit in the UK.\nThe producers also used the Tamperer alias to produce and remix other artists, such as &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Waters\"&gt;Crystal Waters&lt;/a&gt;."
