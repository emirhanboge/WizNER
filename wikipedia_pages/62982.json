    "text": "The Gulf of Tonkin incident (), also known as the USS \"Maddox\" incident, was an international confrontation that led to the United States engaging more directly in the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;. It involved both a proven confrontation on August 2, 1964, carried out by North Vietnamese forces in response to covert operations in the coastal region of the gulf, and a second claimed confrontation on August 4, 1964, between ships of &lt;a href=\"North%20Vietnam\"&gt;North Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; and the United States in the waters of the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Tonkin\"&gt;Gulf of Tonkin&lt;/a&gt;. The original American report blamed North Vietnam for both incidents, but further investigation suggested that the dismissal by &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20State\"&gt;Department of State&lt;/a&gt; and other government personnel of legitimate concerns regarding the veracity of the second incident was used to justify an escalation by the U.S. to a state of war against North Vietnam.\nOn August 2, 1964, the &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; , while performing a &lt;a href=\"signals%20intelligence\"&gt;signals intelligence&lt;/a&gt; patrol as part of &lt;a href=\"DESOTO%20patrol\"&gt;DESOTO&lt;/a&gt; operations, was claimed to have been approached by three North Vietnamese Navy &lt;a href=\"P%204-class%20torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boats&lt;/a&gt; of the 135th Torpedo Squadron. The North Vietnamese boats attacked with torpedoes and machine gun fire. One U.S. aircraft was damaged, three North Vietnamese torpedo boats were damaged, and four North Vietnamese sailors were killed, with six more wounded. There were no U.S. casualties. \"Maddox\" was \"unscathed except for a single bullet hole from a Vietnamese machine gun round\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Security%20Agency\"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; originally claimed that another sea battle, the Second Gulf of Tonkin incident, occurred on August 4, 1964, but instead evidence was found of \"Tonkin ghosts\" (false radar images) and not actual North Vietnamese torpedo boats. In the 2003 documentary \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fog%20of%20War\"&gt;The Fog of War&lt;/a&gt;\", the former &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense\"&gt;United States Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Robert%20S.%20McNamara\"&gt;Robert S. McNamara&lt;/a&gt; admitted that an attack on the USS \"Maddox\" happened on August 2, but the August 4 Gulf of Tonkin attack, for which Washington authorized retaliation, never happened. In 1995, McNamara met with former &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Army%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam People's Army&lt;/a&gt; General &lt;a href=\"V%C3%B5%20Nguy%C3%AAn%20Gi%C3%A1p\"&gt;V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p&lt;/a&gt; to ask what happened on August 4, 1964, in the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident. \"Absolutely nothing\", Gi\u00e1p replied. Gi\u00e1p claimed that the attack had been imaginary.\nThe outcome of these two incidents was the passage by &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Tonkin%20Resolution\"&gt;Gulf of Tonkin Resolution&lt;/a&gt;, which granted U.S. President &lt;a href=\"Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson\"&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson&lt;/a&gt; the authority to assist any &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;n country whose government was considered to be jeopardized by \"&lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; aggression\". The resolution served as Johnson's legal justification for deploying U.S. conventional forces and the commencement of open warfare against North Vietnam.\nIn 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded that \"Maddox\" had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on August 2, but that there were no North Vietnamese naval vessels present during the reported incident of August 4.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1954%20Geneva%20Conference\"&gt;Geneva Conference in 1954&lt;/a&gt; was intended to settle outstanding issues following the end of hostilities between &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Viet%20Minh\"&gt;Viet Minh&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Indochina%20War\"&gt;First Indochina War&lt;/a&gt;. Neither the United States nor &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;State of Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference. The accords, which were signed by other participants including the Viet Minh, mandated a temporary ceasefire line, which separated southern and northern Vietnam to be governed by the State of Vietnam and the Viet Minh respectively. The accords called for a general election by July 1956 to create a unified Vietnamese state. The accords allowed free movement of the population between the north and south for three hundred days. They also forbade the political interference of other countries in the area, the creation of new governments without the stipulated elections, and foreign military presence. By 1961, South Vietnamese President &lt;a href=\"Ngo%20Dinh%20Diem\"&gt;Ngo Dinh Diem&lt;/a&gt; faced significant discontent among some quarters of the southern population, including some &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhists&lt;/a&gt; who were opposed to the rule of Diem's &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; supporters. &lt;a href=\"Viet%20Minh\"&gt;Viet Minh&lt;/a&gt; political &lt;a href=\"Cadre%20%28politics%29\"&gt;cadres&lt;/a&gt;, who were legally campaigning for the promised elections between 1955 and 1957, were suppressed by the government. In March 1956, the North Vietnamese leadership approved tentative measures to revive the southern insurgency in December 1956. A communist-led uprising began against Diem's government in April 1957. The North Vietnamese Communist Party approved a \"people's war\" on the South at a session in January 1959, and on July 28, North Vietnamese forces &lt;a href=\"North%20Vietnamese%20invasion%20of%20Laos\"&gt;invaded Laos&lt;/a&gt; to maintain and upgrade the &lt;a href=\"Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20trail\"&gt;Ho Chi Minh trail&lt;/a&gt;, in support of insurgents in the south. The rebellion, headed by the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, or &lt;a href=\"Viet%20Cong\"&gt;Viet Cong&lt;/a&gt;) under the direction of North Vietnam, had intensified by 1961. About 40,000 communist soldiers infiltrated the south from 1961 to 1963.\nThe Gulf of Tonkin Incident occurred during the first year of the Johnson administration. While U.S. President &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; had originally supported the policy of sending military advisers to Diem, he had begun to alter his thinking because of what he perceived to be the ineptitude of the &lt;a href=\"Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City\"&gt;Saigon&lt;/a&gt; government and its inability and unwillingness to make needed reforms (which led to a &lt;a href=\"1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup\"&gt;U.S.-supported coup&lt;/a&gt; which resulted in the death of Diem). Shortly before &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination\"&gt;Kennedy was assassinated&lt;/a&gt; in November 1963, he had begun a limited recall of U.S. forces. Johnson's views were likewise complex, but he had supported military escalation as a means of challenging what was perceived to be the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;'s expansionist policies. The &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; policy of &lt;a href=\"containment\"&gt;containment&lt;/a&gt; was to be applied to prevent the fall of Southeast Asia to communism under the precepts of the &lt;a href=\"domino%20theory\"&gt;domino theory&lt;/a&gt;. After Kennedy's assassination, Johnson ordered in more U.S. forces to support the Saigon government, beginning a protracted United States presence in Southeast Asia.\nA highly classified program of &lt;a href=\"covert%20operation\"&gt;covert actions&lt;/a&gt; against North Vietnam, known as &lt;a href=\"Operation%2034A\"&gt;Operation Plan 34-Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, in conjunction with the DESOTO operations, had begun under the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CIA) in 1961. In 1964, the program was transferred to the Defense Department and conducted by the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Assistance%20Command%2C%20Vietnam%20%E2%80%93%20Studies%20and%20Observations%20Group\"&gt;Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group&lt;/a&gt; (MACV-SOG). For the maritime portion of the covert operation, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Nasty-class%20patrol%20boat\"&gt;a set of fast patrol boats&lt;/a&gt; had been purchased quietly from &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; and sent to South Vietnam. In 1963, three young Norwegian &lt;a href=\"Sea%20captain%23/Skipper\"&gt;skippers&lt;/a&gt; traveled on a mission in South Vietnam. They were recruited for the job by the Norwegian intelligence officer Alf Martens Meyer. Martens Meyer, who was head of department at the military intelligence staff, operated on behalf of U.S. intelligence. The three skippers did not know who Meyer really was when they agreed to a job that involved them in sabotage missions against North Vietnam. \nAlthough the boats were crewed by South Vietnamese naval personnel, approval for each mission conducted under the plan came directly from Admiral &lt;a href=\"U.%20S.%20Grant%20Sharp%20Jr.\"&gt;U.S. Grant Sharp Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Indo-Pacific%20Command\"&gt;CINCPAC&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Honolulu\"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;, who received his orders from the &lt;a href=\"White%20House\"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;. After the coastal attacks began, &lt;a href=\"Hanoi\"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of North Vietnam, lodged a complaint with the &lt;a href=\"International%20Control%20Commission\"&gt;International Control Commission&lt;/a&gt; (ICC), which had been established in 1954 to oversee the terms of the Geneva Accords, but the U.S. denied any involvement. Four years later, Secretary McNamara admitted to Congress that the U.S. ships had in fact been cooperating in the South Vietnamese attacks against North Vietnam. \"Maddox\", although aware of the operations, was not directly involved.\nThe night before the launching of the actions against North Vietnamese facilities on &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B2n%20M%C3%AA\"&gt;H\u00f2n M\u00ea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B2n%20Ng%C6%B0\"&gt;H\u00f2n Ng\u01b0&lt;/a&gt; islands, the MACV-SOG had launched a covert long-term agent team into North Vietnam, which was promptly captured. That night (for the second evening in a row), two flights of CIA-sponsored Laotian fighter-bombers (piloted by Thai mercenaries) attacked border outposts well within southwestern North Vietnam. The Hanoi government (which, unlike the U.S. government, had to give permission at the highest levels for the conduct of such missions) probably assumed that they were all a coordinated effort to escalate military actions against North Vietnam.\nIncident.\n&lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Ellsberg\"&gt;Daniel Ellsberg&lt;/a&gt;, who was on duty in &lt;a href=\"the%20Pentagon\"&gt;the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; the night of August 4, receiving messages from the ship, reported that the ship was on a secret &lt;a href=\"electronic%20warfare%20support%20measures\"&gt;electronic warfare support measures&lt;/a&gt; mission (codenamed \"DESOTO\") near Northern Vietnamese territorial waters. On July 31, 1964, had begun her intelligence collection mission in the Gulf of Tonkin. Captain &lt;a href=\"George%20Stephen%20Morrison\"&gt;George Stephen Morrison&lt;/a&gt; was in command of local American forces from his &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt; . \"Maddox\" was under orders not to approach closer than eight miles (13\u00a0km) from North Vietnam's coast and four miles (6\u00a0km) from Hon Nieu island. When the commando raid was being carried out against Hon Nieu, the ship was away from the attacked area.\nFirst attack.\nIn July 1964, \"the situation along North Vietnam's territorial waters had reached a near boil\", because of South Vietnamese commando raids and airborne operations that inserted intelligence teams into North Vietnam, as well as North Vietnam's military response to these operations. On the night of July 30, 1964, South Vietnamese commandos attacked a North Vietnamese radar station on H\u00f2n M\u00ea island. According to Hanyok, \"it would be attacks on these islands, especially H\u00f2n M\u00ea, by South Vietnamese commandos, along with the proximity of the \"Maddox\", that would set off the confrontation\", although the \"Maddox\" did not participate in the commando attacks. In this context, on July 31, \"Maddox\" began patrols of the North Vietnamese coast to collect intelligence, coming within a few miles of H\u00f2n M\u00ea island. A U.S. aircraft carrier, the &lt;a href=\"USS%20Ticonderoga%20%28CV-14%29\"&gt;USS \"Ticonderoga\"&lt;/a&gt;, was also stationed nearby.\nBy August 1, North Vietnamese patrol boats were tracking \"Maddox\", and several intercepted communications indicated that they were preparing to attack. \"Maddox\" retreated, but the next day, August 2, \"Maddox\", which had a top speed of 28 knots, resumed her routine patrol, and three North Vietnamese &lt;a href=\"P%204-class%20torpedo%20boat\"&gt;P-4 torpedo boats&lt;/a&gt; with a top speed of 50 knots began to follow \"Maddox\". Intercepted communications indicated that the vessels intended to attack \"Maddox\". As the ships approached from the southwest, \"Maddox\" changed course from northeasterly to southeasterly and increased speed to 25 knots. \nAs the torpedo boats neared, \"Maddox\" fired three warning shots. The North Vietnamese boats then attacked, and \"Maddox\" radioed she was under attack from the three boats, closing to within , while located away from the North Vietnamese coast in &lt;a href=\"international%20waters\"&gt;international waters&lt;/a&gt;. \"Maddox\" stated she had evaded a torpedo attack and opened fire with its five-inch (127\u00a0mm) guns, forcing the torpedo boats away. Two of the torpedo boats had come as close as and released one torpedo each, but neither one was effective, coming no closer than about after \"Maddox\" evaded them. Another P-4 received a direct hit from a five-inch shell from \"Maddox\"; its torpedo malfunctioned at launch. Four USN &lt;a href=\"Vought%20F-8%20Crusader\"&gt;F-8 Crusader&lt;/a&gt; jets launched from \"Ticonderoga\" and 15 minutes after \"Maddox\" had fired her initial warning shots, attacked the retiring P-4s, claiming one was sunk and one heavily damaged. \"Maddox\" suffered only minor damage from a single 14.5\u00a0mm bullet from a P-4's &lt;a href=\"KPV%20heavy%20machine%20gun\"&gt;KPV heavy machine gun&lt;/a&gt; into her superstructure. Retiring to South Vietnamese waters, \"Maddox\" was joined by the destroyer .\nThe original account from the \"&lt;a href=\"Pentagon%20Papers\"&gt;Pentagon Papers&lt;/a&gt;\" has been revised in light of a 2005 internal NSA historical study, which stated on page 17:\n\"Maddox\", when confronted, was approaching H\u00f2n M\u00ea Island, three to four nautical miles (nmi) (6 to 7\u00a0km) inside the limit claimed by North Vietnam. This territorial limit was unrecognized by the United States. After the skirmish, Johnson ordered \"Maddox\" and \"Turner Joy\" to stage daylight runs into North Vietnamese waters, testing the limit and North Vietnamese resolve. These runs into North Vietnamese territorial waters coincided with South Vietnamese coastal raids and were interpreted as coordinated operations by the North, which officially acknowledged the engagements of August 2, 1964.\nOthers, such as Admiral Sharp, maintained that U.S. actions did not provoke the August 2 incident. He claimed that the North Vietnamese had tracked \"Maddox\" along the coast by radar and were thus aware that the destroyer had not actually attacked North Vietnam and that Hanoi (or the local commander) had ordered its craft to engage \"Maddox\" anyway. North Vietnamese general &lt;a href=\"Ph%C3%B9ng%20Th%E1%BA%BF%20T%C3%A0i\"&gt;Ph\u00f9ng Th\u1ebf T\u00e0i&lt;/a&gt; later claimed that \"Maddox\" had been tracked since July 31 and that she had attacked fishing boats on August 2 forcing the North Vietnamese Navy to \"fight back\".\nSharp also noted that orders given to \"Maddox\" to stay off the North Vietnamese coast put the ship in international waters, as North Vietnam claimed only a limit as its territory (or off of its off-shore islands). In addition, many nations had previously carried out similar missions all over the world, and the destroyer had earlier conducted an intelligence-gathering mission in similar circumstances without incident.\nSharp's claims, however, included some factually incorrect statements. North Vietnam did not adhere to an 8-kilometer (5\u00a0mi) limit for its territorial waters; instead it adhered to a limit claimed by &lt;a href=\"French%20Indochina\"&gt;French Indochina&lt;/a&gt; in 1936. Moreover it officially claimed a 12\u00a0nmi limit, which is practically identical to the old 20\u00a0km French claim, after the incidents of August, in September 1964. The North Vietnamese stance is that they always considered a 12 nautical mile limit, consistent with the positions regarding the law of the sea of both the Soviet Union and China, their main allies.\nSecond alleged attack.\nOn August 4, another DESOTO patrol off the North Vietnamese coast was launched by \"Maddox\" and \"Turner Joy\", in order to \"show the flag\" after the first incident. This time their orders indicated that the ships were to close to no less than from the coast of North Vietnam. During an evening of rough weather and heavy seas, the destroyers received radar, sonar, and radio signals that they believed signaled another attack by the North Vietnamese navy. For some two hours (from about 21:40 to about 23:35, local time) the ships fired on radar targets and maneuvered vigorously amid electronic and visual reports of enemies. Despite the Navy's claim that two attacking torpedo boats had been sunk, there was no wreckage, bodies of dead North Vietnamese sailors, or other physical evidence present at the scene of the alleged engagement.\nAt 01:27 local time (13:27 &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; time), Herrick sent a cable in which he acknowledged that the second attack may not have happened and that there may actually have been no Vietnamese craft in the area: \"Review of action makes many reported contacts and torpedoes fired appear doubtful. Freak weather effects on radar and overeager sonarmen may have accounted for many reports. No actual visual sightings by \"Maddox\". Suggest complete evaluation before any further action taken.\"\nOne hour later, Herrick sent another cable, stating, \"Entire action leaves many doubts except for apparent ambush at beginning. Suggest thorough reconnaissance in daylight by aircraft.\" In response to requests for confirmation, at around 16:00 Washington time, Herrick cabled, \"Details of action present a confusing picture although certain that the original ambush was bona fide.\" It is likely that McNamara did not inform either the president or Admiral U. S. Grant Sharp Jr. about Herrick's misgivings or Herrick's recommendation for further investigation. At 18:00 Washington time (05:00 in the Gulf of Tonkin), Herrick cabled yet again, this time stating, \"the first boat to close the \"Maddox\" probably launched a torpedo at the \"Maddox\" which was heard but not seen. All subsequent \"Maddox\" torpedo reports are doubtful in that it is suspected that sonarman was hearing the ship's own propeller beat\".\nIn the face of growing uncertainties over the course of the day regarding whether the attack had occurred, the Johnson administration ended up basing its conclusion that it had mostly on communications intercepts erroneously assessed to be North Vietnamese preparations to carry out an attack and a North Vietnamese after action report. Later analysis showed those communications to have concerned the recovery of torpedo boats damaged in the August 2 attack and North Vietnamese observations of (but not participation in) the August 4 U.S. actions.\nUnited States' response.\nJohnson's speech to the American people.\nShortly before midnight, on August 4, Johnson interrupted national television to make an announcement in which he described an attack by North Vietnamese vessels on two U.S. Navy warships, \"Maddox\" and \"Turner Joy\", and requested authority to undertake a military response. Johnson's speech repeated the theme that \"dramatized &lt;a href=\"Hanoi\"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Ho%20Chi%20Minh\"&gt;Ho Chi Minh&lt;/a&gt; as the aggressor and which put the United States into a more acceptable defensive posture.\" Johnson also referred to the attacks as having taken place \"on the high seas\", suggesting that they had occurred in international waters.\nHe emphasized commitment to both the American people, and the South Vietnamese government. He also reminded Americans that there was no desire for war. \"A close scrutiny of Johnson's public statements ... reveals no mention of preparations for overt warfare and no indication of the nature and extent of covert land and air measures that already were operational.\" Johnson's statements were short to \"minimize the U.S. role in the conflict; a clear inconsistency existed between Johnson's actions and his public discourse.\"\nWithin thirty minutes of the August 4 incident, Johnson had decided on retaliatory attacks (dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"Operation%20Pierce%20Arrow\"&gt;Operation Pierce Arrow&lt;/a&gt;\"). That same day he used the \"hot line\" to Moscow, and assured the Soviets he had no intent in opening a broader war in Vietnam. Early on August 5, Johnson publicly ordered retaliatory measures stating, \"The determination of all Americans to carry out our full commitment to the people and to the government of South Vietnam will be redoubled by this outrage.\" One hour and forty minutes after his speech, aircraft launched from U.S. carriers reached North Vietnamese targets. On August 5, at 10:40, these planes bombed four torpedo boat bases and an oil-storage facility in &lt;a href=\"Vinh\"&gt;Vinh&lt;/a&gt;.\nReaction from Congress.\nWhile Johnson's final resolution was being drafted, U.S. Senator &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Morse\"&gt;Wayne Morse&lt;/a&gt; attempted to hold a fundraiser to raise awareness about possible faulty records of the incident involving \"Maddox\". Morse supposedly received a call from an informant who has remained anonymous urging Morse to investigate official logbooks of \"Maddox\". These logs were not available before Johnson's resolution was presented to Congress. After urging Congress that they should be wary of Johnson's coming attempt to convince Congress of his resolution, Morse failed to gain enough cooperation and support from his colleagues to mount any sort of movement to stop it. Immediately after the resolution was read and presented to Congress, Morse began to fight it. He contended in speeches to Congress that the actions taken by the United States were actions outside the constitution and were \"acts of war rather than acts of defense.\" Morse's efforts were not immediately met with support, largely because he revealed no sources and was working with very limited information. It was not until after the United States became more involved in the war that his claim began to gain support throughout the United States government.\nDistortion of the event.\nThe U.S. government was still seeking evidence on the night of August 4 when Johnson gave his address to the American public on the incident; messages recorded that day indicate that neither Johnson nor McNamara was certain of an attack. Various news sources, including &lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;\"Time\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Life%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;\"Life\"&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Newsweek\"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;\", published articles throughout August on the Tonkin Gulf incident. \"Time\" reported: \"Through the darkness, from the West and south ... intruders boldly sped ... at least six of them ... they opened fire on the destroyers with automatic weapons, this time from as close as 2,000 yards.\" \"Time\" stated that there was \"no doubt in Sharp's mind that the U.S. would now have to answer this attack\", and that there was no debate or confusion within the administration regarding the incident.\nThe use of the set of incidents as a pretext for escalation of U.S. involvement followed the issuance of public threats against North Vietnam, as well as calls from American politicians in favor of escalating the war. On May 4, 1964, &lt;a href=\"William%20Bundy\"&gt;William Bundy&lt;/a&gt; had called for the U.S. to \"drive the communists out of South Vietnam\", even if that meant attacking both North Vietnam and communist China. Even so, the Johnson administration in the second half of 1964 focused on convincing the American public that there was no chance of war between the United States and North Vietnam.\nNorth Vietnam's General Gi\u00e1p suggested that the DESOTO patrol had been sent into the gulf to provoke North Vietnam into giving the U.S. an excuse for escalation of the war. Various government officials and men aboard \"Maddox\" have suggested similar theories. U.S. Undersecretary of State &lt;a href=\"George%20Ball%20%28diplomat%29\"&gt;George Ball&lt;/a&gt; told a British journalist after the war that \"at that time ... many people ... were looking for any excuse to initiate bombing\". George Ball stated that the mission of the destroyer warship involved in the Gulf of Tonkin incident \"was primarily for provocation.\"\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Ray%20McGovern\"&gt;Ray McGovern&lt;/a&gt;, CIA analyst from 1963 to 1990, the CIA, \"not to mention President Lyndon Johnson, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy all knew full well that the evidence of any armed attack on the evening of Aug. 4, 1964, the so-called 'second' Tonkin Gulf incident, was highly dubious. ... During the summer of 1964, President Johnson and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were eager to widen the war in Vietnam. They stepped up sabotage and hit-and-run attacks on the coast of North Vietnam.\" \"Maddox\", carrying electronic spying gear, was to collect signals intelligence from the North Vietnamese coast, and the coastal attacks were seen as a helpful way to get the North Vietnamese to turn on their coastal radars. For this purpose, it was authorized to approach the coast as close as 13 kilometers (8 mi) and the offshore islands as close as four; the latter had already been subjected to shelling from the sea.\nIn his book, \"&lt;a href=\"Body%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Body of Secrets&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"James%20Bamford\"&gt;James Bamford&lt;/a&gt;, who spent three years in the United States Navy as an intelligence analyst, writes that the primary purpose of the \"Maddox\" \"was to act as a seagoing provocateur\u2014to poke its sharp gray bow and the American flag as close to the belly of North Vietnam as possible, in effect shoving its five-inch cannons up the nose of the communist navy. ... The \"Maddox\" mission was made even more provocative by being timed to coincide with commando raids, creating the impression that the Maddox was directing those missions ...\" Thus, the North Vietnamese had every reason to believe that \"Maddox\" was involved in these actions.\nJohn McNaughton suggested in September 1964 that the U.S. prepare to take actions to provoke a North Vietnamese military reaction, including plans to use DESOTO patrols North. William Bundy's paper dated September 8, 1964, suggested more DESOTO patrols as well.\nConsequences.\nBy early afternoon of August 4, Washington time, Herrick had reported to the Commander in Chief Pacific in Honolulu that \"freak weather effects\" on the ship's radar had made such an attack questionable. In fact, Herrick stated in a message sent at 1:27 pm Washington time that no North Vietnamese patrol boats had actually been sighted. Herrick proposed a \"complete evaluation before any further action taken.\"\nMcNamara later testified that he had read the message after his return to the Pentagon that afternoon. But he did not immediately call Johnson to tell him that the whole premise of his decision at lunch to approve McNamara's recommendation for retaliatory air strikes against North Vietnam was highly questionable. Johnson had fended off proposals from McNamara and other advisers for a policy of bombing North Vietnam on four occasions since becoming president.\nAlthough \"Maddox\" had been involved in providing intelligence support for South Vietnamese attacks at H\u00f2n M\u00ea and H\u00f2n Ng\u01b0, Johnson denied, in his testimony before &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;, that the U.S. Navy had supported South Vietnamese military operations in the Gulf. He thus characterized the attack as \"unprovoked\" since the ship had been in international waters. As a result of his testimony, on August 7, Congress passed a &lt;a href=\"joint%20resolution\"&gt;joint resolution&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Tonkin%20Resolution\"&gt;H.J. RES 1145&lt;/a&gt;), titled the Southeast Asia Resolution, which granted Johnson the authority to conduct military operations in Southeast Asia without the benefit of a declaration of war. The resolution gave Johnson approval \"to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia%20Collective%20Defense%20Treaty\"&gt;Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty&lt;/a&gt; requesting assistance in defense of its freedom.\"\nLater statements about the incident.\nJohnson commented privately: \"For all I know, our navy was shooting at whales out there.\"\nIn 1967, former naval officer John White wrote a letter to the editor of the \"New Haven (CT) Register\". He asserts \"I maintain that President Johnson, Secretary McNamara and the Joint Chiefs of Staff gave false information to Congress in their report about US destroyers being attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin.\" White continued his whistleblowing activities in the 1968 documentary \"&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Year%20of%20the%20Pig\"&gt;In the Year of the Pig&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1981, Captain Herrick and journalist &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Scheer\"&gt;Robert Scheer&lt;/a&gt; re-examined Herrick's ship's log and determined that the first torpedo report from August 4, which Herrick had maintained had occurred\u2014the \"apparent ambush\"\u2014was in fact unfounded. Although information obtained well after the fact supported Captain Herrick's statements about the inaccuracy of the later torpedo reports as well as the 1981 Herrick and Scheer conclusion about the inaccuracy of the first, indicating that there was no North Vietnamese attack that night, at the time U.S. authorities and all of the \"Maddox\"s crew stated that they were convinced that an attack had taken place. As a result, planes from the aircraft carriers and were sent to hit North Vietnamese torpedo boat bases and fuel facilities during Operation Pierce Arrow.\nSquadron Commander &lt;a href=\"James%20Stockdale\"&gt;James Stockdale&lt;/a&gt; was one of the U.S. pilots flying overhead during the second alleged attack. Stockdale writes in his 1984 book \"Love and War\": \"[I] had the best seat in the house to watch that event, and our destroyers were just shooting at phantom targets\u2014there were no PT boats there ... There was nothing there but black water and American fire power.\" Stockdale at one point recounts seeing pointing her guns at \"Maddox\". Stockdale said his superiors ordered him to keep quiet about this. After he was captured, this knowledge became a heavy burden. He later said he was concerned that his captors would eventually force him to reveal what he knew about the second incident.\nIn 1995, retired Vietnamese Defense Minister, &lt;a href=\"V%C3%B5%20Nguy%C3%AAn%20Gi%C3%A1p\"&gt;V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p&lt;/a&gt;, meeting with former Secretary McNamara, denied that Vietnamese gunboats had attacked American destroyers on August 4, while admitting to the attack on August 2. A taped conversation of a meeting several weeks after passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was released in 2001, revealing that McNamara expressed doubts to Johnson that the attack had even occurred.\nIn the fall of 1999, retired Senior CIA Engineering Executive &lt;a href=\"S.%20Eugene%20Poteat\"&gt;S. Eugene Poteat&lt;/a&gt; wrote that he was asked in early August 1964 to determine if the radar operator's report showed a real torpedo boat attack or an imagined one. He asked for further details on time, weather and surface conditions. No further details were forthcoming. In the end he concluded that there were no torpedo boats on the night in question, and that the White House was interested only in confirmation of an attack, not that there was no such attack.\nIn October 2012, retired Rear Admiral Lloyd \"Joe\" Vasey was interviewed by David Day on Asia Review and gave a detailed account of the August 4 incident. According to Admiral Vasey, who was aboard , a &lt;a href=\"guided%20missile%20cruiser\"&gt;guided missile cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, in the Gulf of Tonkin and serving as chief of staff to Commander Seventh Fleet, \"Turner Joy\" intercepted an NVA radio transmission ordering a torpedo boat attack on \"Turner Joy\" and \"Maddox\". Shortly thereafter, radar contact of \"several high speed contacts closing in on them\" was acquired by the USS \"Turner Joy\", which locked on to one of the contacts, fired and struck the torpedo boat. There were 18 witnesses, both enlisted and officers, who reported various aspects of the attack; smoke from the stricken torpedo boat, torpedo wakes (reported by four individuals on each destroyer), sightings of the torpedo boats moving through the water and searchlights. All 18 of the witnesses testified at a hearing in Olongapo, Philippines, and their testimony is a matter of public record.\nIn 2014, as the incident's 50th anniversary approached, John White wrote \"The Gulf of Tonkin Events\u2014Fifty Years Later: A Footnote to the History of the Vietnam War\". In the foreword, he notes \"Among the many books written on the Vietnamese war, half a dozen note a 1967 letter to the editor of a Connecticut newspaper which was instrumental in pressuring the Johnson administration to tell the truth about how the war started. The letter was mine.\" The story discusses Lt. White reading Admiral Stockdale's \"In Love and War\" in the mid 1980s, then contacting Stockdale who connected White with Joseph Schaperjahn, chief sonarman on \"Turner Joy\". Schaperjahn confirmed White's assertions that \"Maddox\"s sonar reports were faulty and the Johnson administration knew it prior to going to Congress to request support for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. White's book explains the difference between lies of commission and lies of omission. Johnson was guilty of willful lies of omission. White was featured in the August 2014 issue of \"Connecticut Magazine\".\nNSA report.\nIn October 2005, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that &lt;a href=\"Robert%20J.%20Hanyok\"&gt;Robert J. Hanyok&lt;/a&gt;, a historian for the NSA, concluded that the NSA distorted intelligence reports passed to policy makers regarding the August 4, 1964, incident. The NSA historian said agency staff \"&lt;a href=\"Stovepiping\"&gt;deliberately skewed&lt;/a&gt;\" the evidence to make it appear that an attack had occurred. Hanyok's conclusions were initially published in the Winter 2000/Spring 2001 Edition of \"Cryptologic Quarterly\" about five years before the \"Times\" article. According to intelligence officials, the view of government historians that Hanyok's report should become public was rebuffed by policy makers concerned that comparisons might be made to intelligence used to justify the &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20War\"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; (Operation Iraqi Freedom) which commenced in 2003. \nReviewing the NSA's archives, Hanyok concluded that the August 4 incident began at &lt;a href=\"Phu%20Bai%20Combat%20Base\"&gt;Phu Bai Combat Base&lt;/a&gt;, where intelligence analysts mistakenly believed the destroyers would soon be attacked. This would have been communicated back to the NSA along with evidence supporting such a conclusion, but in fact the evidence did not do that. Hanyok attributed this to the deference that the NSA would have likely given to the analysts who were closer to the event. As the evening progressed, further &lt;a href=\"signals%20intelligence\"&gt;signals intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (SIGINT) did not support any such ambush, but the NSA personnel were apparently so convinced of an attack that they ignored the 90% of SIGINT that did not support that conclusion, and that was also excluded from any reports they produced for the consumption by the president. There was no political motive to their action.\nOn November 30, 2005, the NSA released a first installment of previously classified information regarding the Gulf of Tonkin incident, including a moderately sanitized version of Hanyok's article. The Hanyok article states that intelligence information was presented to the Johnson administration \"in such a manner as to preclude responsible decision makers in the Johnson administration from having the complete and objective narrative of events.\" Instead, \"only information that supported the claim that the communists had attacked the two destroyers was given to Johnson administration officials.\"\nWith regard to why this happened, Hanyok writes:\nHanyok included his study of Tonkin Gulf as one chapter in an overall history of NSA involvement and American SIGINT, in the &lt;a href=\"Indochina%20Wars\"&gt;Indochina Wars&lt;/a&gt;. A moderately &lt;a href=\"Sanitization%20%28classified%20information%29\"&gt;sanitized&lt;/a&gt; version of the overall history was released in January 2008 by the National Security Agency and published by the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20American%20Scientists\"&gt;Federation of American Scientists&lt;/a&gt;."
