In boxing, he held the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20National%20Boxing%20Federation\"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Boxing%20Council\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; heavyweight titles between 2012 and 2015.\nProfessional boxing career.\nEarly career.\nBrowne turned professional on 20 March 2009 at the age of 30. He won his first contest by fourth round knockout. On 17 February 2012, Browne became the Australian heavyweight champion by knocking out &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Wilson%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Colin Wilson&lt;/a&gt; in three rounds.\nOn 28 April 2013, he defeated the future hall of famer and three-weight division world champion &lt;a href=\"James%20Toney\"&gt;James Toney&lt;/a&gt; by twelve round unanimous decision with scores of 117\u2013111, 119\u2013109, and 120\u2013108. Three months later, he stopped former &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Boxing%20Federation\"&gt;NABF&lt;/a&gt; heavyweight champion &lt;a href=\"Travis%20Walker\"&gt;Travis Walker&lt;/a&gt; in seven rounds. Walker dropped Browne in round 1. Although Walker appeared to clearly win round 7, his corner called the fight off before round 8 could get underway.\nIn November 2013, Browne scored a fifth round TKO of former European Union heavyweight champion &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Towers\"&gt;Richard Towers&lt;/a&gt;. The fight was an eliminator for the Commonwealth heavyweight title, which at the time was held by David Price.\nRegional success.\nOn 26 April 2014, Browne fought \u00c9ric Martel-Baho\u00e9li for the vacant Commonwealth heavyweight title at the &lt;a href=\"Ponds%20Forge\"&gt;Ponds Forge Arena&lt;/a&gt; in Sheffield, England. Browne knocked down Martel-Baho\u00e9li in round 2 but the fight continued. In round 3, following an accidental clash of heads, Browne was cut over the left eye. Two inspections were undertaken by the ringside doctor, who allowed the fight continue. Martel-Baho\u00e9li was knocked down again in round 4 and the end came in round 5 when Browne connected with a right uppercut. Browne also claimed the WBC Eurasian Pacific Boxing Council heavyweight title.\nBrowne vs. Rudenko.\nBrowne defended the WBC-EPBC title on 1 August 2014 against &lt;a href=\"Andriy%20Rudenko\"&gt;Andriy Rudenko&lt;/a&gt; (24-0) at the &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Civic%20Hall\"&gt;Civic Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton\"&gt;Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt;, England. Browne defeated Rudenko by a 12 round unanimous decision to win the vacant &lt;a href=\"World%20Boxing%20Association\"&gt;WBA Inter-Continental&lt;/a&gt; heavyweight title. The judges scored the fight 116\u2013112, 115\u2013113, and 117\u2013112 all in favour of Browne.\nCareer from 2016\u20132017.\nBrowne vs. Chagaev.\nOn 14 November 2015, the WBA ordered &lt;a href=\"Ruslan%20Chagaev\"&gt;Ruslan Chagaev&lt;/a&gt; to reach a deal to make a defence of his WBA title against Australian heavyweight contender Browne. The two sides had until 30 November to reach a deal. Chagaev's promoter Timur Dugazaev announced the fight would likely take place in &lt;a href=\"Grozny\"&gt;Grozny&lt;/a&gt; in March 2016. In the January 2016, the fight was officially announced to take place on 5 March. Browne won the fight by stopping Chagaev in the tenth round. Browne landed nearly 20 unanswered punches, mostly right hands, before referee &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Christodoulou\"&gt;Stanley Christodoulou&lt;/a&gt; stopped the fight at 2 minutes, 27 seconds. Browne was knocked down in the sixth round and at the time of the knockout, behind on all judges scorecards, 81\u201388, 82\u201388, and 82\u201388. The fight was not without controversy, with a reported 59 seconds of erroneous time during rounds 6 and 7 of the bout.\nDrug issues.\nBrowne was later stripped of the title due to a failed drug test for the banned substance &lt;a href=\"clenbuterol\"&gt;clenbuterol&lt;/a&gt;. Browne repeatedly maintained his innocence, however testing on the second sample for the drug proved positive.\nOn 2 November 2016, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Boxing%20Association\"&gt;WBA&lt;/a&gt; ordered Browne to fight American heavyweight veteran &lt;a href=\"Shannon%20Briggs\"&gt;Shannon Briggs&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"WBA%20%28Regular%29\"&gt;WBA regular&lt;/a&gt; title. The fight was ordered to take place before the end of 2016. Browne was originally due to fight &lt;a href=\"Fres%20Oquendo\"&gt;Fres Oquendo&lt;/a&gt;, who hadn't fought since 2014, however that fight could not be made due to Oquendo recovering from an injury. The WBA ordered the winner of this bout to fight Oquendo in a &lt;a href=\"mandatory%20challenger\"&gt;mandatory defense&lt;/a&gt; within 120 days.\nReports indicated that after 8 months of being stripped of the WBA heavyweight title due to positive A and B samples for the banned substance &lt;a href=\"clenbuterol\"&gt;clenbuterol&lt;/a&gt;, Browne has produced another positive drug test, this time for the banned substance &lt;a href=\"ostarine\"&gt;ostarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 18 May 2017, Browne's manager, Matt Clark announced that he would be making a return to the ring on 2 June 2017 at the Club Punchbowl in &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. On 26 May, his opponent was announced as journeyman Mathew Greer (16-20, 13 KOs). In a scheduled six round fight, Browne dropped and stopped the over matched Greer in round 2. After the win, Browne set his sights on WBO heavyweight champion &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Parker%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Joseph Parker&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer from 2018.\nBrowne vs. Whyte.\nOn 17 October 2017, it was reported that Browne would travel to Moscow, Russia, to fight unbeaten 30-year-old &lt;a href=\"Sergei%20Kuzmin%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Sergei Kuzmin&lt;/a&gt; (11-0, 8 KOs) for the WBA Inter-Continental title on 27 November. Kuzmin, known for his amateur background where he beat the likes of &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Joyce%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Joe Joyce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roberto%20Cammarelle\"&gt;Robert Cammarelle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Dychko\"&gt;Ivan Dychko&lt;/a&gt;. Browne backed out of the fight and was replaced by American boxer &lt;a href=\"Amir%20Mansour\"&gt;Amir Mansour&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 November, it was reported that Browne had signed a deal to challenge undefeated &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20WBO%20world%20champions\"&gt;WBO heavyweight&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Parker%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Joseph Parker&lt;/a&gt;. Locations discussed were Parker's home city of &lt;a href=\"Auckland\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; or Melbourne in Australia. Browne's promoter Matt Clark stated that Browne had signed the contract and was now waiting on Parker to sign the deal. At the time, Browne was not listed in the WBO's top 15 rankings, meaning he would need to fight for a WBO regional title to get ranked. On 11 January 2018, the fight between Browne and WBC Silver heavyweight champion &lt;a href=\"Dillian%20Whyte\"&gt;Dillian Whyte&lt;/a&gt; was finally made, to take place at the &lt;a href=\"The%20O2%20Arena\"&gt;O2 Arena&lt;/a&gt; in London on 24 March. In order to win Whyte's WBC Silver title, Browne vowed to get into immense physical condition, joining the weight loss challenge at F45 Kellyville Ridge, while also adding the burn machine to his strength and conditioning program.\nWhyte hit Browne with a hard left hook to the head in round 6 to knock him down and out unconscious, winning the fight. There was no count made and the fight was waved off immediately with ringside doctors attending to Browne before giving him oxygen. The fight was officially stopped at 0:37 of the round. Browne's face was cut and badly swollen from the clean shots landed from Whyte. Browne left himself open most of the time and tried switching stances after a few rounds. Browne suffered a cut over his left eye in round 3, which got worse with each round. Whyte then bloodied Browne's nose in round 5. After the fight, Browne was stretchered to a nearby hospital for precaution and Whyte called out WBC champion &lt;a href=\"Deontay%20Wilder\"&gt;Deontay Wilder&lt;/a&gt; for a fight in June 2018. Promoter Hearn said, \"I hope the WBC make Dillian mandatory now, the fight is there for Deontay Wilder in June. We have to force the shot and after that performance, he deserves the shot.\" Hearn stated there could be a possibility that the WBC order a final eliminator between Whyte and &lt;a href=\"Dominic%20Breazeale\"&gt;Dominic Breazeale&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack to winning ways.\nBrowne returned to the ring on 28 September 2018 at the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Convention%20and%20Exhibition%20Centre\"&gt;Convention and Exhibition Centre&lt;/a&gt; in Gold Coast and knocked out 41-year-old &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Long\"&gt;Julius Long&lt;/a&gt; (18\u201320, 14 KOs) for a second time in three years. A right hand to the chin knocked out Long. After the fight, Browne called out &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Allen%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;Dave Allen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Kownacki\"&gt;Adam Kownacki&lt;/a&gt;. He was also called out by &lt;a href=\"David%20Price%20%28boxer%29\"&gt;David Price&lt;/a&gt; in October.\nBrowne returned two months later on 24 November against journeyman Junior Pati at the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Johns%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Saint Johns&lt;/a&gt; Netball Centre in &lt;a href=\"Auckland\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, New Zealand. The fight marked Browne's first time fighting in the country as a professional. Browne controlled the fight, eventually knocking Pati out in round 5 with a left hook followed by a right uppercut. Referee &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Revill\"&gt;Lance Revill&lt;/a&gt; waved off the fight. Browne also claimed the vacant WBC Asian Boxing Council silver title. After the fight, Browne published a short video on his Instagram account crediting his return to F45 at Kellyville Ridge and the addition of an intense swimming pool preparation as being the key contributors to his immense physical condition.\nBrowne vs. Sokolowski.\nOn 2 March, 2019, Browne fought Kamil Sokolowski. Browne won the six round bout on points.\nBrowne vs. Allen.\nIn his next fight, Browne faced David Allen. The first two rounds didn't provide too much action, but in the third round Allen caught Browne with a vicious body shot and knocked him down. Browne was not able to recover and Allen was awarded the KO victory in the third round.\nBrowne vs. Gallen.\nOn 21 April, 2021, Browne went up against Paul Gallen and lost via first round technical knockout.\nPersonal life.\nBrowne has three children.
