    "text": "The Free State (; ; ; ; ; before 1995, the Orange Free State) is a &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Its capital is &lt;a href=\"Bloemfontein\"&gt;Bloemfontein&lt;/a&gt;, which is also South Africa's judicial capital. Its historical origins lie in the &lt;a href=\"Boer%20republic\"&gt;Boer republic&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Free%20State\"&gt;Orange Free State&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Free%20State%20Province\"&gt;Orange Free State Province&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe current borders of the province date from 1994 when the &lt;a href=\"Bantustan\"&gt;Bantustan&lt;/a&gt;s were abolished and reincorporated into South Africa. It is also the only one of the four original provinces of South Africa not to undergo border changes, apart from the reincorporation of Bantustans, and has had these borders since before the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Boer%20War\"&gt;Boer War&lt;/a&gt;.\nLaw and government.\nThe provincial government consists of a premier, an executive council of ten ministers, and a legislature. The provincial assembly and premier are elected for five-year terms, or until the next national election. Political parties are awarded assembly seats based on the percentage of votes each party receives in the province during the national elections. The assembly elects a premier, who then appoints the members of the executive council.\nThe provincial legislature meets at the &lt;a href=\"Vierde%20Raadsaal\"&gt;Vierde Raadsaal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bloemfontein\"&gt;Bloemfontein&lt;/a&gt;. The premier of Free State is &lt;a href=\"Sisi%20Ntombela\"&gt;Sisi Ntombela&lt;/a&gt;. She has been serving since her appointment in March 2018.\nGeography.\nThe Free State is situated on a succession of flat grassy plains sprinkled with pastureland, resting on a general elevation of 3,800 feet only broken by the occasional hill or &lt;a href=\"kopje\"&gt;kopje&lt;/a&gt;. The rich soil and pleasant climate allow for a thriving agricultural industry. With more than 30,000 farms, which produce over 70% of the country's grain, it is known locally as South Africa's &lt;a href=\"breadbasket\"&gt;breadbasket&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe province is high-lying, with almost all land being 1,000 metres above sea level. The &lt;a href=\"Drakensberg\"&gt;Drakensberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maluti%20Mountains\"&gt;Maluti Mountains&lt;/a&gt; foothills raise the terrain to over 2,000 m in the east. The Free State lies in the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Karoo\"&gt;Karoo&lt;/a&gt; Sequence of rocks, containing &lt;a href=\"shales\"&gt;shales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mudstones\"&gt;mudstones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sandstones\"&gt;sandstones&lt;/a&gt; and the Drakensberg &lt;a href=\"Basalt\"&gt;Basalt&lt;/a&gt; forming the youngest capping rocks. Mineral deposits are plentiful, with gold and &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; being of particular importance, mostly found in the north and west of the province.\nFauna and flora.\nThe flats in the south of the reserve provide ideal conditions for large herds of plain game such as &lt;a href=\"black%20wildebeest\"&gt;black wildebeest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"springbok\"&gt;springbok&lt;/a&gt;. The ridges, koppies and plains typical of the northern section are home to &lt;a href=\"kudu\"&gt;kudu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20hartebeest\"&gt;red hartebeest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"southern%20white%20rhinoceros\"&gt;southern white rhinoceros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"African%20buffalo\"&gt;buffalo&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Southern%20African%20wildcat\"&gt;Southern African wildcat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"black%20wildebeest\"&gt;black wildebeest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zebra\"&gt;zebra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"common%20eland\"&gt;eland&lt;/a&gt;, white rhinoceros and &lt;a href=\"Cape%20wild%20dog\"&gt;wild dog&lt;/a&gt; can be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Soetdoring%20Nature%20Reserve\"&gt;Soetdoring Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Bloemfontein\"&gt;Bloemfontein&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20cheetah\"&gt;South African cheetah&lt;/a&gt;s were reintroduced in the Free State for the first time in June 2013 after a hundred years of regional extinction, at &lt;a href=\"Laohu%20Valley%20Reserve\"&gt;Laohu Valley Reserve&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Philippolis\"&gt;Philippolis&lt;/a&gt;. Following the reintroduction of an adult female South African cheetah in early 2016, three wild cheetah cubs were born for the first time in Laohu Valley Reserve in February 2017, making the three new cubs the first cheetahs born in the wild since their disappearance from the Free State province in over a century.\nClimate.\nThe Free State experiences a &lt;a href=\"continental%20climate\"&gt;continental climate&lt;/a&gt;, characterised by warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters. Areas in the east experience frequent snowfalls, especially on the higher ranges, whilst the west can be extremely hot in summer. Almost all &lt;a href=\"Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29\"&gt;precipitation&lt;/a&gt; falls in the summer months as brief afternoon &lt;a href=\"thunderstorms\"&gt;thunderstorms&lt;/a&gt;, with aridity increasing towards the west. Areas in the east around &lt;a href=\"Harrismith\"&gt;Harrismith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bethlehem%2C%20Free%20State\"&gt;Bethlehem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ficksburg\"&gt;Ficksburg&lt;/a&gt; are well watered. The capital, &lt;a href=\"Bloemfontein\"&gt;Bloemfontein&lt;/a&gt;, experiences hot, moist summers and cold, dry winters frequented by severe frost.\nBorders.\nIn the southeast, the Free State borders seven &lt;a href=\"districts%20of%20Lesotho\"&gt;districts of Lesotho&lt;/a&gt;:\nDomestically, it borders the following provinces:\nThe Free State borders more districts of Lesotho and more provinces of South Africa than any other province.\nIt is traversed by the northwesterly line of equal latitude and longitude.\nMunicipalities.\nThe Free State Province is divided into one &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20municipality%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;metropolitan municipality&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"district%20municipality%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;district municipalities&lt;/a&gt;. The district municipalities are in turn divided into 19 &lt;a href=\"local%20municipality%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;local municipalities&lt;/a&gt;:\nMajor cities and towns.\nThe Free State's major towns include:\nHealth.\nThe Free State is the only province in South Africa that operates a free 24-hour dedicated rotor-wing aeromedical service from a public hospital. They are able to reach far-flung areas in only 45 minutes and deliver a high level of care on scene. On 31 October 2018, Free State Emergency Medical Service launched an additional 65 road ambulances to augment the fleet.\nThe Free State has many public and private hospitals. Some of them are:\nEconomy.\nThe province is the granary of South Africa, with agriculture central to its economy, while mining on the rich goldfields reef is its largest employer.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture dominates the Free State landscape, with cultivated land covering 32,000 square kilometres, and natural veld and grazing a further 87,000 square kilometres of the province. It is also South Africa's leader in the production of biofuels, or fuel from agricultural crops, with a number of ethanol plants under construction in the grain-producing western region. South Africa is one of the top ten &lt;a href=\"Maize\"&gt;Maize&lt;/a&gt; producers in the world (12,365,000 tons ) whereby all of the crops come from the Free State. The Free State is well known for its \"Mielielande\" (corn-fields; the former term is in &lt;a href=\"Afrikaans\"&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/a&gt;).\nField crops yield almost two-thirds of the gross agricultural income of the province. Animal products contribute a further 30%, with the balance generated by horticulture. Ninety percent of the country's cherry crop is produced in the Ficksburg district, which is also home to the country's two largest asparagus canning factories. Soya, sorghum, sunflowers and wheat are cultivated in the eastern Free State, where farmers specialise in seed production. About 40% of the country's potato yield comes from the province's high-lying areas.\nThe main vegetable crop is asparagus, both white and green varieties. Although horticulture is expanding and becoming increasingly export-orientated, most produce leaves the province unprocessed.\nThe Free State's advantage in floriculture is the opposing seasons of the southern and northern hemispheres. The province exports about 1.2\u00a0million tons of &lt;a href=\"cut%20flowers\"&gt;cut flowers&lt;/a&gt; a year.\nMining.\nThe Free State is also rich in mineral wealth, gold representing 20% of the world's total gold production. Mining is the province's major employer. The province has 12 gold mines, producing 30% of South Africa's output and making it the fifth-largest producer of gold in the world. The Harmony Gold Refinery and Rand Refinery are the only two gold refineries in South Africa.\nGold mines in the Free State also supply a substantial portion of the total silver produced in the country, while considerable concentrations of uranium occurring in the gold-bearing conglomerates of the goldfields are extracted as a byproduct.\nBituminous coal is also mined, and converted to petrochemicals at Sasolburg. The Free State also produces high-quality diamonds from its kimberlite pipes and fissures, and the country's largest deposit of bentonite is found in the &lt;a href=\"Koppies\"&gt;Koppies&lt;/a&gt; district.\nIndustry.\nSince 1989, the Free State economy has moved from dependence on primary sectors such as mining and agriculture to an economy increasingly oriented towards manufacturing and export. \nSome 14% of the province's manufacturing is classified as being in high-technology industries \u2013 the highest of all provincial economies. The northern Free State's chemicals sector is one of the most important in the southern hemisphere. Petrochemicals company &lt;a href=\"Sasol\"&gt;Sasol&lt;/a&gt;, based in the town of &lt;a href=\"Sasolburg\"&gt;Sasolburg&lt;/a&gt;, is a world leader in the production of fuels, waxes, chemicals and low-cost feedstock from coal.\nTourism.\nIn the northeastern Free State, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Maluti mountains, the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Gate%20Highlands%20National%20Park\"&gt;Golden Gate Highlands National Park&lt;/a&gt; is the province's prime tourist attraction. The park gets its name from the brilliant shades of gold cast by the sun on the spectacular sandstone cliffs, especially the imposing Brandwag or Sentinel Rock, which keeps vigil over the park.\nThe sandstone of this region has been used for the lovely dressed-stone buildings found on the Eastern Highlands, while decoratively painted &lt;a href=\"Sotho%20people\"&gt;Sotho&lt;/a&gt; houses dot the grasslands. Some of South Africa's most valued San (Bushman) rock art is found in the Free State, particularly in the regions around &lt;a href=\"Clarens%2C%20Free%20State\"&gt;Clarens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bethlehem%2C%20Free%20State\"&gt;Bethlehem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ficksburg\"&gt;Ficksburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ladybrand\"&gt;Ladybrand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wepener\"&gt;Wepener&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemographics.\n&lt;a href=\"Sesotho\"&gt;Sesotho&lt;/a&gt; is the dominant home language in most of the province. &lt;a href=\"isiZulu\"&gt;isiZulu&lt;/a&gt; is the major language in the far eastern municipality of &lt;a href=\"Phumelela%20Local%20Municipality\"&gt;Phumelela&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Setswana\"&gt;Setswana&lt;/a&gt; is the main language in &lt;a href=\"Tokologo%20Local%20Municipality\"&gt;Tokologo&lt;/a&gt; in the northwest, and in and around the area of &lt;a href=\"Thaba%20Nchu\"&gt;Thaba Nchu&lt;/a&gt;. The Free State is the only province in South Africa with a Sesotho majority. &lt;a href=\"Afrikaans\"&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/a&gt; is widely spoken throughout the province, as a first language for the majority of whites and coloureds and as a second or third language by Sesotho, Setswana and isiZulu speakers. Although there are relatively few native English speakers, English is becoming increasingly important as the language of business and government. This is evidenced by the shift of tertiary institutions such as the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20Free%20State\"&gt;University of the Free State&lt;/a&gt; from solely using Afrikaans as the medium of instruction to using both Afrikaans and English.\nEthnicity.\nThe majority of the population are black Africans who speak &lt;a href=\"Sotho%20language\"&gt;Sotho&lt;/a&gt; as a first language. The vast majority of white people in the Free State are Afrikaans-speaking. In 1880 the white population made up 45.7% of the total population. In 1904 this had fallen to 36.8%. Of the 142,679 people in 1904, only 60% were born in the province. Of the 2,726 &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an immigrants born in non-&lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; states, 1,025 came from the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, mainly &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt;. In 1904 whites made up a majority in most settlements, namely &lt;a href=\"Ficksburg\"&gt;Ficksburg&lt;/a&gt; (52.3%), &lt;a href=\"Wepener\"&gt;Wepener&lt;/a&gt; (60.2%), &lt;a href=\"Ladybrand\"&gt;Ladybrand&lt;/a&gt; (60.0%), and &lt;a href=\"Kroonstad\"&gt;Kroonstad&lt;/a&gt; (51.6%), and made up a substantial minority in &lt;a href=\"Bloemfontein\"&gt;Bloemfontein&lt;/a&gt; (45.7%) and &lt;a href=\"Winburg\"&gt;Winburg&lt;/a&gt; (36.3%)."
