    "text": "Louis Antonio Page (27 March 1899 \u2013 11 October 1959) was an &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; international &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and football manager. His brothers &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Page%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Page%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201886%29\"&gt;Jack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Page\"&gt;Willie&lt;/a&gt; were also professional footballers.\nHe spent his youth with &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;South Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, before beginning his professional career with &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Stoke&lt;/a&gt; in 1919. After the \"Potters\" won promotion out of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt;, he moved on to &lt;a href=\"Northampton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Northampton Town&lt;/a&gt; in 1922. Three years later he moved up to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Burnley%20F.C.\"&gt;Burnley&lt;/a&gt;. He scored 111 goals in 248 league games for the \"Clarets\", before he was sold to &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; for a \u00a31,000 fee in March 1932. Seven months later he moved on to &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt;, before ending his playing career in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; in summer 1933.\nHe started his management career with &lt;a href=\"Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Yeovil &amp; Petters United&lt;/a&gt;, and led the club to the Southern League West Section and Western League Division 1 titles in 1934\u201335. He then returned to the Football League with &lt;a href=\"Newport%20County%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Newport County&lt;/a&gt;. He later took charge at &lt;a href=\"Glentoran%20F.C.\"&gt;Glentoran&lt;/a&gt;, before he was put in charge at &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt; following the conclusion of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. He spent eight years in charge of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South\"&gt;Third Division South&lt;/a&gt; club, before he spent three years in charge at &lt;a href=\"Chester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Chester&lt;/a&gt;, who were struggling at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North\"&gt;Third Division North&lt;/a&gt; table.\nClub career.\nPage began his senior career with &lt;a href=\"Merseyside\"&gt;Merseyside&lt;/a&gt; clubs &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;South Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;. He entered professional football with &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Stoke&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"1919%E2%80%9320%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1919\u201320&lt;/a&gt; season, scoring his first senior goal on 13 December, in a 2\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"St%20Andrew%27s%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;St Andrew's&lt;/a&gt;. However, he featured just eight times in &lt;a href=\"1920%E2%80%9321%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1920\u201321&lt;/a&gt; and then once in &lt;a href=\"1921%E2%80%9322%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1921\u201322&lt;/a&gt;, as the \"Potters\" won promotion out of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe left the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Ground\"&gt;Victoria Ground&lt;/a&gt; to sign with &lt;a href=\"Northampton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Northampton Town&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South\"&gt;Third Division South&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Cobblers\" finished eighth in &lt;a href=\"1922%E2%80%9323%20Football%20League\"&gt;1922\u201323&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1923%E2%80%9324%20Football%20League\"&gt;1923\u201324&lt;/a&gt;, and ninth in &lt;a href=\"1924%E2%80%9325%20Football%20League\"&gt;1924\u201325&lt;/a&gt;. He scored 24 goals in 122 league games at the &lt;a href=\"County%20Cricket%20Ground%2C%20Northampton\"&gt;County Ground&lt;/a&gt;.\nPage transferred to &lt;a href=\"Burnley%20F.C.\"&gt;Burnley&lt;/a&gt;, who finished one place and one point above the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; relegation zone in &lt;a href=\"1925%E2%80%9326%20Football%20League\"&gt;1925\u201326&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote himself into the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Burnley%20F.C.%20records%20and%20statistics\"&gt;club's record books&lt;/a&gt; on 10 April 1926, when he scored six goals in a 7\u20131 win over Birmingham. He finished as the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Burnley%20F.C.%20seasons\"&gt;club's top scorer&lt;/a&gt; in 1925\u201326 with 26 goals. He scored 15 goals in &lt;a href=\"1926%E2%80%9327%20Football%20League\"&gt;1926\u201327&lt;/a&gt; to again become the club's top scorer, as the \"Clarets\" achieved a top five finish. They dropped to 19th in &lt;a href=\"1927%E2%80%9328%20Football%20League\"&gt;1927\u201328&lt;/a&gt;, two places and one point above the relegation zone. They again finished 19th in &lt;a href=\"1928%E2%80%9329%20Football%20League\"&gt;1928\u201329&lt;/a&gt;, but were this time seven points above the drop zone. Burnley were relegated in &lt;a href=\"1929%E2%80%9330%20Football%20League\"&gt;1929\u201330&lt;/a&gt;, having attained a lower goal average than &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt;. They then finished eighth in the Second Division in &lt;a href=\"1930%E2%80%9331%20Football%20League\"&gt;1930\u201331&lt;/a&gt; and 19th in &lt;a href=\"1931%E2%80%9332%20Football%20League\"&gt;1931\u201332&lt;/a&gt;. He made 248 league appearances, scoring 111 goals, during his time at &lt;a href=\"Turf%20Moor\"&gt;Turf Moor&lt;/a&gt;.\nPage joined &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Crickmer\"&gt;Walter Crickmer&lt;/a&gt;'s Second Division side &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; for a \u00a31,000 fee in March 1932. He played nine games at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1931%E2%80%9332%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1931\u201332&lt;/a&gt; season and three games at the start of the &lt;a href=\"1932%E2%80%9333%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1932\u201333&lt;/a&gt; season, before falling out of favour under new secretary &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Duncan%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Scott Duncan&lt;/a&gt; and moving on to league rivals &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt; in October 1932. He played 19 games in all competitions during the &lt;a href=\"1932%E2%80%9333%20Port%20Vale%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1932\u201333&lt;/a&gt; season, falling out of favour in March 1933. He was not kept on at &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Recreation%20Ground\"&gt;The Old Recreation Ground&lt;/a&gt; beyond the campaign, and so Page left the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; to forge a career in management.\nInternational career.\nPage featured for &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; seven times in 1927, alongside England and &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; great &lt;a href=\"Dixie%20Dean\"&gt;Dixie Dean&lt;/a&gt;. He played four &lt;a href=\"British%20Home%20Championship\"&gt;British Home Championship&lt;/a&gt; games and three &lt;a href=\"exhibition%20game\"&gt;friendlies&lt;/a&gt;, and scored against &lt;a href=\"Belgium%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; on 1 May 1927; his goal came in the 63rd minute, in what was a 9\u20131 victory.\nManagement career.\nYeovil &amp; Petters United.\nPage's first managerial post was with &lt;a href=\"Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Yeovil &amp; Petters United&lt;/a&gt; in summer 1933, also being registered as a player. He finished as the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.%20seasons\"&gt;club's top scorer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1933%E2%80%9334%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;1933\u201334&lt;/a&gt; with 23 goals. In the &lt;a href=\"1934%E2%80%9335%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;1934\u201335&lt;/a&gt; season, Yeovil topped both the Southern League West Section and Western League Division 1 tables.\nNewport County.\nPage was appointed manager at Welsh club &lt;a href=\"Newport%20County%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Newport County&lt;/a&gt; in 1935. The club finished 21st in the 22 team &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South\"&gt;Third Division South&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1935%E2%80%9336%20Newport%20County%20A.F.C.%20season\"&gt;1935\u201336&lt;/a&gt;, but successfully applied for re-election. Newport then moved up to 19th in the &lt;a href=\"1936%E2%80%9337%20Newport%20County%20A.F.C.%20season\"&gt;1936\u201337&lt;/a&gt; campaign, finishing two places and two points above the re-election zone. He left the club on 9 September 1937, a few games into the &lt;a href=\"1937%E2%80%9338%20Newport%20County%20A.F.C.%20season\"&gt;1937\u201338&lt;/a&gt; season; his successor, &lt;a href=\"Billy%20McCandless\"&gt;Billy McCandless&lt;/a&gt;, led the club to a 16th-place finish in the Third Division South.\nAfter leaving Newport he became trainer-coach at &lt;a href=\"Glentoran%20F.C.\"&gt;Glentoran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1939%E2%80%9340%20Irish%20League\"&gt;1939\u201340&lt;/a&gt;, as the \"Glens\" finished third in the &lt;a href=\"IFA%20Premiership\"&gt;Irish League&lt;/a&gt;. He later served as manager of &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;-based Carlton F.C.\nSwindon Town.\nWhen league football resumed after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, he was appointed manager of &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt;. Page was forced to build a completely fresh team, and so Swindon's fourth-place finish in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South\"&gt;Third Division South&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1946%E2%80%9347%20Football%20League\"&gt;1946\u201347&lt;/a&gt; was seen as a highly respectable achievement. The \"Robins\" slumped to 16th place the &lt;a href=\"1947%E2%80%9348%20Football%20League\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 just two points off the bottom spot. They did though knock &lt;a href=\"Burnley%20F.C.\"&gt;Burnley&lt;/a&gt; out of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, before being beaten in the Fifth Round by &lt;a href=\"Southampton%20F.C.\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1948%E2%80%9349%20Football%20League\"&gt;1948\u201349&lt;/a&gt;, Swindon again finished fourth, without ever challenging for the &lt;a href=\"promotion%20and%20relegation\"&gt;promotion&lt;/a&gt; spot.\nSwindon then finished 14th in &lt;a href=\"1949%E2%80%9350%20Football%20League\"&gt;1949\u201350&lt;/a&gt;, 17th in &lt;a href=\"1950%E2%80%9351%20Football%20League\"&gt;1950\u201351&lt;/a&gt;, 16th in &lt;a href=\"1951%E2%80%9352%20Football%20League\"&gt;1951\u201352&lt;/a&gt;, and 18th in &lt;a href=\"1952%E2%80%9353%20Football%20League\"&gt;1952\u201353&lt;/a&gt;. Page always had to deal with a shoestring budget at the &lt;a href=\"County%20Ground%2C%20Swindon\"&gt;County Ground&lt;/a&gt;, and was forced to sell many of his top players. Page was relieved of his duties at the end of the 1952\u201353 season, and was handed \u00a3500 in compensation.\nChester.\nHe became manager of &lt;a href=\"Chester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Chester&lt;/a&gt; in 1953. The \"Seals\" finished bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North\"&gt;Third Division North&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1953%E2%80%9354%20Football%20League\"&gt;1953\u201354&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sealand%20Road\"&gt;Sealand Road&lt;/a&gt; outfit again finished last in &lt;a href=\"1954%E2%80%9355%20Football%20League\"&gt;1954\u201355&lt;/a&gt;, before rising to 17th in &lt;a href=\"1955%E2%80%9356%20Football%20League\"&gt;1955\u201356&lt;/a&gt;. He later worked as a &lt;a href=\"Scout%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer statistics.\nSource:\nHonours.\nAs a player.\nStoke\nEngland\nAs player-manager.\nYeovil &amp; Petters United "
