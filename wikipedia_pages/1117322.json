    "text": "Lotus corniculatus is a &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; in the pea family &lt;a href=\"Fabaceae\"&gt;Fabaceae&lt;/a&gt;, native to grasslands in temperate &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt; and North &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Common names include common bird's-foot trefoil, eggs and bacon, birdsfoot deervetch, and just bird's-foot trefoil, though the latter name is often also applied to other members of the genus.\nIt is a &lt;a href=\"Perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;aceous plant, similar in appearance to some &lt;a href=\"clover\"&gt;clover&lt;/a&gt;s. The name 'bird's foot' refers to the appearance of the seed pods on their stalk. Five &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaf&lt;/a&gt;lets are present, but with the central three held conspicuously above the others, hence the use of the name 'trefoil'. It is often used as forage and is widely used as food for livestock due to its nonbloating properties.\nSubspecies:\nDescription.\nThe height of the plant is variable, from , occasionally more where supported by other plants; the stems can reach up to long. It is typically sprawling at the height of the surrounding grassland. It can survive fairly close grazing, trampling, and mowing. It is most often found in sandy &lt;a href=\"soil\"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt;s. It flowers from June to September. The flowers develop into small pea-like pods or &lt;a href=\"legume\"&gt;legume&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe plant had many common &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; names in &lt;a href=\"UK\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, which are now mostly out of use. These names were often connected with the yellow and orange colour of the flowers, e.g. 'butter and eggs'. One name that is still used is eggs and bacon (or bacon and eggs).\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Lotus corniculatus\" has a broad distribution worldwide. It is common everywhere in Britain. It is abundant in Ireland, and also in Northern Ireland, including &lt;a href=\"County%20Londonderry\"&gt;County Londonderry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Down\"&gt;County Down&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"County%20Antrim\"&gt;County Antrim&lt;/a&gt;. Habitats include old fields, grassy places, and roadsides.\nUses.\nIt is used in &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Fodder\"&gt;forage&lt;/a&gt; plant, grown for &lt;a href=\"pasture\"&gt;pasture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hay\"&gt;hay&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"silage\"&gt;silage&lt;/a&gt;. It is a high quality forage that does not cause bloat in ruminants. Taller-growing &lt;a href=\"cultivar\"&gt;cultivar&lt;/a&gt;s have been developed for this. It may be used as an alternative to &lt;a href=\"alfalfa\"&gt;alfalfa&lt;/a&gt; in poor soils. \nA double-flowered variety is grown as an &lt;a href=\"ornamental%20plant\"&gt;ornamental plant&lt;/a&gt;. It is regularly included as a component of &lt;a href=\"wildflower\"&gt;wildflower&lt;/a&gt; mixes in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. It can also prevent soil erosion and provide a good habitat for wildlife.\nFresh bird's-foot trefoil contains &lt;a href=\"Glycoside%23Cyanogenic%20glycosides\"&gt;cyanogenic glycosides&lt;/a&gt;, which release small amounts of &lt;a href=\"hydrogen%20cyanide\"&gt;hydrogen cyanide&lt;/a&gt; when macerated. This is not normally poisonous to humans, though, as the dose is very low, and the metabolization of cyanide is relatively quick. Condensed tannins are also present in \"L. corniculatus\".\nIn the traditional medicine of the Sannio regio of Italy, the diluted infusions were used for anxiety, insomnia, and exhaustion.\nEcology.\nThe flowers are mostly visited by &lt;a href=\"bumblebee\"&gt;bumblebee&lt;/a&gt;s. In the Chicago Region, mostly non-native bees have been observed visiting the flowers, including \"&lt;a href=\"Andrena%20wilkella\"&gt;Andrena wilkella&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Anthidium%20oblongatum\"&gt;Anthidium oblongatum&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Apis%20mellifera\"&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Megachile%20rotundata\"&gt;Megachile rotundata&lt;/a&gt;\". The native bees \"&lt;a href=\"Bombus%20impatiens\"&gt;Bombus impatiens&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Megachile%20relativa\"&gt;Megachile relativa&lt;/a&gt;\" have also been observed visiting birdsfoot trefoil flowers, though the latter only rarely.\nThe plant is an important &lt;a href=\"nectar\"&gt;nectar&lt;/a&gt; source for many &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s and is also used as a &lt;a href=\"larva\"&gt;larva&lt;/a&gt;l food plant by many species of &lt;a href=\"Lepidoptera\"&gt;Lepidoptera&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"six-spot%20burnet\"&gt;six-spot burnet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"silver-studded%20blue\"&gt;silver-studded blue&lt;/a&gt;. It is a host plant for the wood white butterfly, \"&lt;a href=\"Leptidea%20sinapis\"&gt;Leptidea sinapis&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInvasive species.\nBirdsfoot trefoil is an &lt;a href=\"invasive%20species\"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt; in many parts of &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It has been commonly planted along roadsides for erosion control or pastures for forage and then spreads into &lt;a href=\"remnant%20natural%20area\"&gt;natural areas&lt;/a&gt;. Once it has established in an area, it can outcompete &lt;a href=\"native%20species\"&gt;native species&lt;/a&gt;. The use of &lt;a href=\"prescribed%20fire\"&gt;prescribed fire&lt;/a&gt; is not an effective management tool against \"Lotus corniculatus\" and herbicide is recommended to control it."
