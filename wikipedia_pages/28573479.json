    "text": "Raffaele Ferlotti (27 February 1819 \u2013 11 November 1891) was an Italian &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;tic &lt;a href=\"baritone\"&gt;baritone&lt;/a&gt; who had an active international career from the 1830s through the 1860s. He was a regular performer in Italy's leading opera houses, especially &lt;a href=\"La%20Scala\"&gt;La Scala&lt;/a&gt;, and created roles in several world premieres. On the international stage he performed in operas in Austria, England, France, and Spain.\nLife and career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Bologna\"&gt;Bologna&lt;/a&gt;, Ferlotti was the son of &lt;a href=\"choreographer\"&gt;choreographer&lt;/a&gt; Nicola Ferlotti and &lt;a href=\"ballerina\"&gt;ballerina&lt;/a&gt; Paola Scutelari. His older sister was the soprano Santina Ferlotti-Sangiorgi. The first known performance by Ferlotti was as concert soloist in Ravenna in 1835. Later that year he appeared at the Teatro Comunale in Faenza as Bartolomeo in &lt;a href=\"Gaetano%20Donizetti\"&gt;Gaetano Donizetti&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20furioso%20all%27isola%20di%20San%20Domingo\"&gt;Il furioso all'isola di San Domingo&lt;/a&gt;\". He was soon invited to make appearances at major &lt;a href=\"opera%20house\"&gt;opera house&lt;/a&gt;s throughout Italy. In 1836 he appeared at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20Comunale%20di%20Bologna\"&gt;Teatro Comunale di Bologna&lt;/a&gt; as Tartufo in &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Coccia\"&gt;Carlo Coccia&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Clotilde\". He returned to that house in 1842 to sing the title role in &lt;a href=\"Federico%20Ricci\"&gt;Federico Ricci&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Corrado d'Altamura\". In 1838 he made his debut at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20Regio%20di%20Parma\"&gt;Teatro Regio di Parma&lt;/a&gt; as Israele in Donizett's \"&lt;a href=\"Marino%20Faliero%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Marino Faliero&lt;/a&gt;\". He returned to that theatre in 1841 to portray Enrico Ashton in Donizetti's \"&lt;a href=\"Lucia%20di%20Lammermoor\"&gt;Lucia di Lammermoor&lt;/a&gt;\" with &lt;a href=\"Teresa%20De%20Giuli-Borsi\"&gt;Teresa De Giuli-Borsi&lt;/a&gt; in the title role. He also appeared in Parma in 1842 as Contareno in &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Cohen%20%28composer%29\"&gt;Henri Cohen&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Antonio Foscarini\", Don Alfonso d'Este in Donizetti's \"&lt;a href=\"Lucrezia%20Borgia%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Lucrezia Borgia&lt;/a&gt;\", and Publio in &lt;a href=\"Saverio%20Mercadante\"&gt;Saverio Mercadante&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"La%20vestale%20%28Mercadante%29\"&gt;La vestale&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1840 Ferlotti arrived at &lt;a href=\"La%20Fenice\"&gt;La Fenice&lt;/a&gt; where he appeared as Assur in &lt;a href=\"Gioachino%20Rossini\"&gt;Gioachino Rossini&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Semiramide\"&gt;Semiramide&lt;/a&gt;\", the Count of Vergy in Donizetti's \"&lt;a href=\"Gemma%20di%20Vergy\"&gt;Gemma di Vergy&lt;/a&gt;\", Giorgio Talbot in \"&lt;a href=\"Maria%20Stuarda\"&gt;Maria Stuarda&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Guido%20della%20Torre\"&gt;Guido della Torre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Nini\"&gt;Alessandro Nini&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Ida della Torre\". On 5 September 1840 he made his debut at &lt;a href=\"La%20Scala\"&gt;La Scala&lt;/a&gt; as the Cavaliere di Belfiore in the world premiere of &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Verdi\"&gt;Giuseppe Verdi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Un%20giorno%20di%20regno\"&gt;Un giorno di regno&lt;/a&gt;\". Although that opera was a failure, he sang two more roles at that house later that year to much greater success: Briano in &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Nicolai\"&gt;Otto Nicolai&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20templario\"&gt;Il templario&lt;/a&gt;\" and Ernesto in &lt;a href=\"Vincenzo%20Bellini\"&gt;Vincenzo Bellini&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20pirata\"&gt;Il pirata&lt;/a&gt;\". He returned to La Scala several more times during his career, notably performing in the world premieres of &lt;a href=\"Temistocle%20Solera\"&gt;Temistocle Solera&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Il contadino d'Agleiate\" (1841), &lt;a href=\"Achille%20Graffigna\"&gt;Achille Graffigna&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Ildegondo e Rizzario\" (1841), Ruggero in &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Pacini\"&gt;Giovanni Pacini&lt;/a&gt;'s \"L'ebrea\" (1844), &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Petrali\"&gt;Luigi Petrali&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Sofonisba\" (1844), and in such roles as the Count of Vergy (1842) and Ernesto Malcolm in &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Pacini\"&gt;Giovanni Pacini&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Maria%2C%20regina%20d%27Inghilterra\"&gt;Maria, regina d'Inghilterra&lt;/a&gt;\" (1843).\nIn 1845 Ferlotti appeared in operas by Verdis and Donizetti at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20Real\"&gt;Teatro Real&lt;/a&gt; in Madrid. In 1848 he performed as a guest artist at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20di%20San%20Carlo\"&gt;Teatro di San Carlo&lt;/a&gt; in Naples as Don Alfonso d'Este, Israele, and the title hero in Verdi's \"&lt;a href=\"Nabucco\"&gt;Nabucco&lt;/a&gt;\". He sang Don Alfonso d'Este there again in 1849 and in 1850 was heard in Naples as Severo in Donizetti's \"&lt;a href=\"Poliuto\"&gt;Poliuto&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1855 he portrayed the Miller in Verdi's \"&lt;a href=\"Luisa%20Miller\"&gt;Luisa Miller&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20Argentina\"&gt;Teatro Argentina&lt;/a&gt; in Rome. In 1858\u20131859 he was committed to the &lt;a href=\"Liceu\"&gt;Liceu&lt;/a&gt; in Barcelona. He also performed as a guest artist at the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Opera\"&gt;Paris Opera&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Royal Opera House&lt;/a&gt; in London, and the &lt;a href=\"Vienna%20State%20Opera\"&gt;Vienna State Opera&lt;/a&gt;. After retiring from the stage in the early 1860s, he taught singing in Bologna at a school he founded with his sister around 1850. One of his students there was his niece, &lt;a href=\"Giuseppina%20Vitali\"&gt;Giuseppina Vitali&lt;/a&gt;, who followed in his footsteps on stages throughout Europe as an opera singer. He died in Bologna in 1891 at the age of 72."
