    "text": "The Kamuzu Stadium is a &lt;a href=\"multi-purpose%20stadium\"&gt;multi-purpose stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blantyre%2C%20Malawi\"&gt;Blantyre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malawi\"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt;. It is currently used mostly for &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches. The stadium holds about 40,000 people. This can be limited for safety reasons. &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bullets\"&gt;Big Bullets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mighty%20Wanderers\"&gt;Be Forward Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; are tenants.\nHistory.\nThe stadium was originally named Rangeley Stadium during the colonial era to commemorate British civil servant William H. J. Rangeley. It later became known as Kamuzu Stadium, after Malawi's first President, &lt;a href=\"Hastings%20Kamuzu%20Banda\"&gt;Hastings Kamuzu Banda&lt;/a&gt;, when Malawi gained independence from Britain. The main stands were designed and drawn by L Jeffery and Steve Price, the works completed in 1968. After Kamuzu's presidency, the name was changed to Chichiri Stadium under President &lt;a href=\"Bakili%20Muluzi\"&gt;Bakili Muluzi&lt;/a&gt;; however, under Muluzi's successor, &lt;a href=\"Bingu%20wa%20Mutharika\"&gt;Bingu wa Mutharika&lt;/a&gt;, the name Kamuzu Stadium was restored in 2004.\nFIFA through its GOAL programme has sponsored the renovation of the natural grass pitch into a synthetic football pitch. This artificial turf field, called Xtreme Turf, has been manufactured and installed by Act Global.\nPresident &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Mutharika\"&gt;Peter Mutharika&lt;/a&gt;'s inauguration ceremony was held at Kamuzu Stadium on 2 June 2014."
