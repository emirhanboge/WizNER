    "text": "Sir Alexander Matthew Busby, &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire\"&gt;CBE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20St.%20Gregory%20the%20Great\"&gt;KCSG&lt;/a&gt; (26 May 1909 \u2013 20 January 1994) was a Scottish &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and manager, who managed &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; between 1945 and 1969 and again for the second half of the 1970\u201371 season. He was the first manager of an English team to win the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt; and is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time.\nBefore going into management, Busby was a player for two of Manchester United's greatest rivals, &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;. During his time at City, Busby played in two FA Cup Finals, winning one of them. After his playing career was interrupted by the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, Busby was offered the job of assistant coach at Liverpool, but they were unwilling to give him the control over the first team that he wanted. As a result, he took the vacant manager's job at Manchester United instead, where he built the famous &lt;a href=\"Busby%20Babes\"&gt;Busby Babes&lt;/a&gt; team. Eight of these players died in the &lt;a href=\"Munich%20air%20disaster\"&gt;Munich air disaster&lt;/a&gt;, but Busby rebuilt the side and United won the &lt;a href=\"1967%E2%80%9368%20European%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt; a decade later. In a total of 25 years with the club, he won 13 trophies.\nEarly life.\nBusby was born to Alexander and Helen \"Nellie\" (n\u00e9e Greer) Busby in a two-roomed pitman's cottage in the mining village of Orbiston, &lt;a href=\"Bellshill\"&gt;Bellshill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lanarkshire\"&gt;Lanarkshire&lt;/a&gt;. When he was born, Busby's mother was told by the doctor, \"A footballer has come into this house today\". Busby's father was a miner, but was called up to serve in the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; and killed by a sniper's bullet on 23 April 1917 at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29\"&gt;Battle of Arras&lt;/a&gt;. His great-great grandfather, George Busby, emigrated to Scotland from Ireland during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Great Famine&lt;/a&gt;, while his mother's side of the family emigrated to Scotland from Ireland later on in the 19th century. Three of his uncles were killed in France with the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Own%20Cameron%20Highlanders\"&gt;Cameron Highlanders&lt;/a&gt;. Busby's mother was left to raise Matt and his three sisters alone until her marriage to a man called Harry Matthie in 1919.\nBusby would often accompany his father down into the coal pits, but his true aspiration was to become a professional footballer. In his 1973 autobiography Busby described himself as being as football mad as any other boy in Bellshill citing in particular the impression made on him by &lt;a href=\"Alex%20James%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Alex James&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hughie%20Gallacher\"&gt;Hughie Gallacher&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis mother might have quashed those dreams when she applied to emigrate with Matt to the United States in the late 1920s, but he was granted a reprieve by the nine-month processing time.\nIn the meantime, Busby got a full-time job as a collier and played football part-time for &lt;a href=\"Stirlingshire\"&gt;Stirlingshire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Junior&lt;/a&gt; side Denny Hibs. He had played only a few matches for Denny Hibs, but it was not long before he was signed up by a &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; side that was a couple of games away from regaining promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nClub career.\nAged 18, Busby signed for &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; on a one-year contract worth \u00a35 per week on 11 February 1928, with the provision for him to leave at the end of the deal if he still wished to emigrate to the United States with his mother. He decided to stay and made his debut for City on 2 November 1929, more than 18 months after first signing for the Blues, when he played at &lt;a href=\"inside%20forward\"&gt;inside left&lt;/a&gt; in a 3\u20131 win at home to &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt;. He made 11 more appearances for City that season, all at &lt;a href=\"inside%20forward\"&gt;inside forward&lt;/a&gt;, scoring five goals in the process.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"1930%E2%80%9331%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1930\u201331 season&lt;/a&gt;, City manager &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Hodge\"&gt;Peter Hodge&lt;/a&gt; decided that Busby's talents could be better exploited from the half-back line, with Busby playing the right-half role. In his new position, Busby built up a reputation as an intelligent player and a finer passer of the ball. In 1930, Manchester United made an enquiry about signing Busby from their cross-town rivals, but they were unable to afford the \u00a3150 fee that City demanded. By the 1931\u201332 season, Busby was firmly established in the first team, missing just one match that season. Indeed, Busby and &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Bray\"&gt;Jackie Bray&lt;/a&gt; became such fixtures at wing-half that club captain &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20McMullan\"&gt;Jimmy McMullan&lt;/a&gt; had to move to forward to keep his place in the team. In the 1930s Manchester City performed strongly in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. They reached the semi-finals in 1932, and the final in &lt;a href=\"1933%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1933&lt;/a&gt; before finally winning the tournament in &lt;a href=\"1934%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1934&lt;/a&gt;. However, from the second half of the 1934\u201335 season, Busby's number 4 jersey was worn by &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Percival%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201913%29\"&gt;Jack Percival&lt;/a&gt; with increasing regularity, and Busby was sold to &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Pound%20sterling\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;8,000 on 12 March 1936, having made more than 200 appearances for Manchester City.\nHe made his debut for the Reds just two days later, on 14 March, away to &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Huddersfield Town&lt;/a&gt;; the match ended in a 1\u20130 Liverpool defeat. Busby opened his goalscoring account a month later \u2013 his 47th-minute strike helped his team to a 2\u20132 draw with &lt;a href=\"Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackburn Rovers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ewood%20Park\"&gt;Ewood Park&lt;/a&gt;. Busby soon made the number 4 shirt his own, ousting &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Savage%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Ted Savage&lt;/a&gt; in the process. He rarely missed a game over the following three seasons. This consistency earned Busby the Liverpool &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;captaincy&lt;/a&gt; and he led the club with great distinction. Along with &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20McDougall%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Jimmy McDougall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Bradshaw%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201904%29\"&gt;Tom Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt;, Busby made up what is considered by many to be the best half-back line Liverpool had ever had.\n&lt;a href=\"Bob%20Paisley\"&gt;Bob Paisley&lt;/a&gt; joined Liverpool from Bishop Auckland in 1939, and it was Busby who took him under his wing and showed him the ropes at &lt;a href=\"Anfield\"&gt;Anfield&lt;/a&gt;. This led to a lifelong friendship between two of the most successful managers in English football history. The &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; arrived soon after, and with it came an end to Busby's playing days. Like many of the Liverpool playing staff, he signed on for national service in the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Regiment%20%28Liverpool%29\"&gt;King's Liverpool Regiment&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar years.\nBusby carried on playing football during the war. A few days after helping &lt;a href=\"Aldershot%20F.C.\"&gt;Aldershot&lt;/a&gt; defeat &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20133 in a &lt;a href=\"benefit%20match\"&gt;benefit match&lt;/a&gt;, Busby signed for Chelsea on 28 October 1939. He made four appearances in total. He also turned out for &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; (13 matches), &lt;a href=\"Reading%20F.C.\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brentford%20F.C.\"&gt;Brentford&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Bournemouth\"&gt;Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt; lured Busby back north in 1941 at a time when English clubs did not want their players in &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20Scotland\"&gt;Scottish football&lt;/a&gt; unless they were insured. He played in 37 matches for the club and scored five goals (including one against city rivals &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hearts&lt;/a&gt;). Busby appeared in back-to-back &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Cup%20%28Scottish%20football%29\"&gt;Summer Cup&lt;/a&gt; finals against &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; with a 3\u20132 victory in the &lt;a href=\"1940%E2%80%9341%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;1941&lt;/a&gt; competition.\nAfter returning to &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, he was appointed assistant coach of the club in May 1944. While based in &lt;a href=\"Catterick%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Catterick&lt;/a&gt;, he also starred for Portrack Shamrocks in the 1945 Ellis Cup final as a war-time guest.\nInternational career.\nBusby made only one official international appearance for &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;; he played in a 3\u20132 &lt;a href=\"British%20Home%20Championship\"&gt;British Home Championship&lt;/a&gt; defeat to &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ninian%20Park\"&gt;Ninian Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cardiff\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;, on 4 October 1933. Playing opposite Busby in the Welsh half-back line was his future assistant &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Murphy%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Jimmy Murphy&lt;/a&gt;. Busby also made seven appearances for Scotland against &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; during the Second World War, winning just one of them, but these are considered unofficial. He represented the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20League%20XI\"&gt;Scottish League XI&lt;/a&gt; in an inter-league match in 1941, while he was a guest player of &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt;.\nManagerial career.\nArrival and early days at Manchester United.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, Busby served as a football coach in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Army%20Physical%20Training%20Corps\"&gt;Army Physical Training Corps&lt;/a&gt;, and the experience resulted in Liverpool offering him the job of assistant to their then-manager &lt;a href=\"George%20Kay\"&gt;George Kay&lt;/a&gt;. However, the experience had also forged Busby's opinions about how football should be played and governed, and when it became clear that they differed from those of the Liverpool board, their chairman Billy McConnell allowed Busby to pursue alternative employment.\nAfter Manchester United had tried to sign Busby from Manchester City in 1930, he became good friends with United's fixer, &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Rocca\"&gt;Louis Rocca&lt;/a&gt;; their relationship was helped by the fact that both were members of the Manchester Catholic Sportsman's Club. United were in desperate need of a manager to take over from club secretary &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Crickmer\"&gt;Walter Crickmer&lt;/a&gt; after the war and a board meeting was called in December 1944 so as to ascertain who that new manager might be. Knowing that Liverpool had already offered Busby a job, Rocca convinced the United board to \"leave it to [him]\" and immediately wrote a letter to Busby, addressed to his army regiment. The letter was vague, referring only to \"a job\", just in case it fell into the wrong hands, namely the Liverpool officials.\nIn February 1945, still in uniform, Busby turned up at Cornbrook Cold Storage, one of the United chairman &lt;a href=\"James%20W.%20Gibson\"&gt;James W. Gibson&lt;/a&gt;'s businesses at Trafford Park to discuss the contents of Rocca's letter with the chairman. Busby requested that he be directly involved in training, pick the team on matchdays and even choose the players to be bought and sold without interference from the club directors, who, he believed, did not know the game as well as he did. Such a level of control over the team was unprecedented in the English game, but the United chairman was in no position to argue. Busby was originally offered a three-year contract but managed to secure himself a five-year deal after explaining that it would take at least that long for his revolution to have a tangible effect.\nThe contract was signed that day \u2013 19 February 1945 \u2013 but it was not until 1 October that Busby officially took over the reins at Manchester United. In the interim, he returned to the Army Physical Training Corps, whose football team he took to &lt;a href=\"Bari\"&gt;Bari&lt;/a&gt;, Italy, in the spring of 1945. There, he took in a training session for a football team made up of &lt;a href=\"non-commissioned%20officer\"&gt;non-commissioned officer&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt;'s former half-back &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Murphy%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Jimmy Murphy&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed by the Welshman's oratory skills, Busby engaged him in conversation and offered him the job of chief coach at Manchester United, which Murphy accepted verbally there and then, before joining the club officially in early 1946.\nThe two men immediately put their mark on the side, leading them to the runners-up spot in the league, behind Busby's former employers Liverpool, by the end of the 1946\u201347 season. Manchester United were runners-up in the league in 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1951, and won the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1948, before winning the league championship in 1952. This was a welcome success for a club which had last won a major trophy in 1911 and had spent the interwar years bouncing between the First and Second Divisions.\nBy 1952, however, the side captained by &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Carey\"&gt;Johnny Carey&lt;/a&gt;, was beginning to show its age, and a new set of players had to be found. Busby, who had achieved a great deal of success in spite of his lack of previous managerial experience, was expected to spend large sums of money on high-profile players. Instead, he gradually replaced the older players with players as young as 16 and 17. These included right-back &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Foulkes\"&gt;Bill Foulkes&lt;/a&gt;, centre-halves &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201933%29\"&gt;Mark Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Blanchflower\"&gt;Jackie Blanchflower&lt;/a&gt;, wingers &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Scanlon\"&gt;Albert Scanlon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"David%20Pegg\"&gt;David Pegg&lt;/a&gt; and forward &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Whelan\"&gt;Billy Whelan&lt;/a&gt;. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Duncan%20Edwards\"&gt;Duncan Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, judged by many to be England's finest player of his era, and capped by &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; at 17 \u2013 setting a record for the youngest-ever full international that remained unbroken for more than 40 years. He made relatively few signings from other clubs between 1951 and 1957, rare examples being winger &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Berry\"&gt;Johnny Berry&lt;/a&gt;, forward &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Taylor\"&gt;Tommy Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Gregg\"&gt;Harry Gregg&lt;/a&gt;.\nBusby managed the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20men%27s%20Olympic%20football%20team\"&gt;Great Britain team&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201948%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1948 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. The team reached the semi-finals, but lost 3\u20131 to the eventual runners-up, &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1956, just after United won another league title, Busby was offered the &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; managerial role. The &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20presidents\"&gt;Real Madrid president&lt;/a&gt; at the time, &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Yeste\"&gt;Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Yeste&lt;/a&gt;, told him that the role was \"like managing paradise\". Busby responded by declining the job and adding \"Manchester is my heaven\".\nThe Busby Babes and the Munich tragedy.\nDuring this period, the team picked up the affectionate nickname the &lt;a href=\"Busby%20Babes\"&gt;Busby Babes&lt;/a&gt;, because of the youthfulness of many of the players he fielded. They won the league in both 1956 and 1957, and were runners-up to &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1957%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1957 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;. The young side was so successful that centre-forward &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Taylor\"&gt;Tommy Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Gregg\"&gt;Harry Gregg&lt;/a&gt; were United's only major signings over a spell of almost five years.\nBusby and his team began the &lt;a href=\"1957%E2%80%9358%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1957\u201358 season&lt;/a&gt; full of ambition for an assault on the &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; title, &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt;. On the way home from a European Cup tie against &lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Belgrade\"&gt;Red Star Belgrade&lt;/a&gt; on 6 February 1958, their &lt;a href=\"Munich%20air%20disaster\"&gt;plane crashed&lt;/a&gt; on the runway at &lt;a href=\"Munich-Riem%20Airport\"&gt;Munich-Riem Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Seven players and three club officials were among the 20 people who were killed at the scene; Duncan Edwards died from his injuries two weeks later as the final death toll reached 23, while two other players were injured to such an extent that they never played football again. Busby's old friend from &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;, the goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Swift\"&gt;Frank Swift&lt;/a&gt;, who had travelled to Munich in his post-playing career as a journalist, also died. Busby suffered multiple injuries and twice received the &lt;a href=\"last%20rites\"&gt;last rites&lt;/a&gt;, but he recovered from his injuries and left the hospital after nine weeks.\nHe was not aware of the extent of the Munich tragedy until some three weeks after the crash, as doctors felt he was not strong enough to know the truth until then. Sometime around the end of February, he asked a Franciscan friar at the hospital how Duncan Edwards was faring; the friar was unaware that the news of Edwards's death had been kept from him and felt that it was his duty to inform Busby that Edwards was dead. His wife Jean then had to tell him of all the other players and officials who had lost their lives.\nHe reportedly told his wife that he felt like quitting the manager's job, as he had feelings of guilt over the disaster. Busby had gone against the wishes of &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; officials by pressing for Manchester United's participation in the European Cup and had not felt able to challenge the aircraft's pilot about taking off in heavy snow. Jean urged him to carry on with his duties in honour of the players who had died. Busby also had to face the torment of player &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Berry\"&gt;Johnny Berry&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 who suffered career-ending injuries in the crash \u2013 complaining that Tommy Taylor was a poor friend for not visiting him in hospital, unaware that Taylor had been killed; Busby had been urged to keep the news from Berry at this stage, which he found particularly difficult.\nIn the meantime, the team was managed by Jimmy Murphy, who had been taking charge of the &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; team at the time of the crash, and so was not present. Busby attended a new-look United side's &lt;a href=\"1958%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;FA Cup final&lt;/a&gt; defeat against &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley&lt;/a&gt; three months later, and resumed full managerial duties for the &lt;a href=\"1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt;.\nBusby had been appointed the manager of &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; before the Munich disaster. &lt;a href=\"Dawson%20Walker\"&gt;Dawson Walker&lt;/a&gt; took charge of the team during the &lt;a href=\"1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1958 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; instead. After recovering from his injuries, Busby managed Scotland in two games later that year against &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. Busby gave an 18-year-old &lt;a href=\"Denis%20Law\"&gt;Denis Law&lt;/a&gt;, then with Huddersfield Town, his first Scotland cap. He had already expressed an interest in signing Law for United by this stage, although he had yet to be successful in doing so.\nThe post-Munich side.\nAfter the crash, Busby built a new side around Munich survivors including &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Gregg\"&gt;Harry Gregg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Charlton\"&gt;Bobby Charlton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Foulkes\"&gt;Bill Foulkes&lt;/a&gt;. He also brought in players from other clubs \u2013 these included &lt;a href=\"David%20Herd%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;David Herd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Quixall\"&gt;Albert Quixall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Denis%20Law\"&gt;Denis Law&lt;/a&gt;. Northern Irish forward &lt;a href=\"George%20Best\"&gt;George Best&lt;/a&gt; was scouted for Manchester United by Bob Bishop and signed to the club's playing staff by chief scout &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Armstrong%20%28football%20scout%29\"&gt;Joe Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;.\nBusby successfully rebuilt United, as he guided them to a 3\u20131 victory over &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1963%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1963 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;. They were league champions in 1965 and again in 1967, with a defeat on the final day of the &lt;a href=\"1967%E2%80%9368%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1967\u201368 season&lt;/a&gt; seeing rivals Manchester City snatch the title away.\nEuropean glory and retirement.\nThe biggest success of his career came on &lt;a href=\"1968%20European%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;29 May 1968&lt;/a&gt; when the team won the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt;. He retired as manager at the end of the following season, having announced his intention to do so on 14 January 1969, but remained at the club as a director, handing over managerial duties to trainer and former player &lt;a href=\"Wilf%20McGuinness\"&gt;Wilf McGuinness&lt;/a&gt;. When McGuinness was sacked in December 1970, Busby briefly returned to his managerial duties, but there was never any question of his returning as manager permanently. The job went to &lt;a href=\"Frank%20O%27Farrell\"&gt;Frank O'Farrell&lt;/a&gt; in June 1971 after United were unsuccessful in approaching &lt;a href=\"Jock%20Stein\"&gt;Jock Stein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Don%20Revie\"&gt;Don Revie&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe carried on as a club director for 11 years, before being made president in 1980.\nBusby was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire\"&gt;CBE&lt;/a&gt; in 1958 and was &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;ed following the European Cup victory in 1968, before being made a Knight Commander of St Gregory by the Pope in 1972.\nLater years and death.\nBusby suffered a mild stroke in July 1980 at the age of 71 but made a full recovery. Soon afterwards, however, his wife Jean became ill with &lt;a href=\"Alzheimer%27s%20disease\"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. She died, aged 80, in December 1988 in a Manchester nursing home. They had been married for 58 years.\nBusby was the subject of \"&lt;a href=\"This%20Is%20Your%20Life%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;This Is Your Life&lt;/a&gt;\" on two occasions, in January 1958 (a month before the Munich tragedy) when he was surprised by &lt;a href=\"Eamonn%20Andrews\"&gt;Eamonn Andrews&lt;/a&gt; at the BBC Studios in &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, and in May 1971, when he became the first \"&lt;a href=\"This%20Is%20Your%20Life%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;This Is Your Life&lt;/a&gt;\" subject to be honoured for the second time. On this occasion, Andrews surprised him just ahead of his final game as interim manager, leading &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; in a derby match with Manchester City at Maine Road.\nHe died, aged 84, on 20 January 1994 at The &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Hospital%20%28Cheadle%29\"&gt;Alexandra Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Cheadle, Greater Manchester. He had been admitted to the hospital earlier that month to have a blood clot removed from his leg, and had appeared to be making a good recovery until his condition deteriorated after several days. \nHe was buried in &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Cemetery%2C%20Manchester\"&gt;Southern Cemetery, Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, alongside his wife Jean. His racecourse owner friend Willie Satinoff, who died in the Munich air crash, is buried in the same cemetery. Two days after Busby's death, a minute's silence was held at the start of United's home game against &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; in the Premier League. United finished that season as &lt;a href=\"double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt; winners, lifting the league title and &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis &lt;a href=\"Testimonial%20match\"&gt;testimonial&lt;/a&gt; was held at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt; in August 1991. A Manchester United side featuring a new generation of star players including &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Hughes\"&gt;Mark Hughes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Bruce\"&gt;Steve Bruce&lt;/a&gt; took on a &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Republic of Ireland XI&lt;/a&gt;. The result was a 1\u20131 draw.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Matt%20Busby%20Sports%20Complex\"&gt;sports centre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bellshill\"&gt;Bellshill&lt;/a&gt;, his place of birth, was named after him shortly after his death. This opened to the public in 1995.\nIn 1999, in securing the treble of Premier League, FA Cup and European Cup, Manchester United won the European Cup on what would have been Busby's 90th birthday - the first time they had won the trophy since Busby's 1968 triumph. Then, in 2008, Manchester United won the Champions League again, 50 years after the Munich tragedy, and 40 years since his own triumph in Europe in 1968 where Busby's United defeated Benfica. \nThe day after the centenary of Busby's birth, Manchester United played &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2009%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;2009 Champions League final&lt;/a&gt; and lost to the Spanish side 2\u20130. Busby was made an inaugural inductee of the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;English Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the sport.\nOn 6 September 2009, the Sir Matt Busby Shield was contested between &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20Reserves%20and%20Academy\"&gt;Manchester United Reserves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Motherwell%20F.C.\"&gt;Motherwell&lt;/a&gt;. This was held at &lt;a href=\"Fir%20Park\"&gt;Fir Park&lt;/a&gt;, two miles from Busby's place of birth, to mark 100 years since his birth. Motherwell won the match 1\u20130.\nHis son Sandy died on 15 September 2014, followed nearly nine months later by his daughter Sheena, who had been married to former Manchester United player &lt;a href=\"Don%20Gibson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201929%29\"&gt;Don Gibson&lt;/a&gt; for 59 years. He had a total of seven grandchildren, all female.\nPortrayal in film and television.\nBusby was portrayed by actor &lt;a href=\"Dougray%20Scott\"&gt;Dougray Scott&lt;/a&gt; in the 2011 television drama \"&lt;a href=\"United%20%282011%20film%29\"&gt;United&lt;/a&gt;\", which was centred on the successes of the Busby Babes and the Munich air crash, as well as the rebuilding of the team by &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Murphy%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Jimmy Murphy&lt;/a&gt; while Busby recovered from his injuries. Busby's son Sandy told &lt;a href=\"BBC%20News\"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; that he was \"disgusted\" by the film. He pointed out that the character of Busby, despite being the first \"tracksuit manager\" in English football, was never seen in a tracksuit throughout the film, instead wearing a camel coat and a fedora.\n&lt;a href=\"Brian%20Cox%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Brian Cox&lt;/a&gt; portrayed an older Busby (and Charlie Cook a younger Busby in flashbacks to 1958) in the 2013 film \"&lt;a href=\"Believe%20%282013%20film%29\"&gt;Believe&lt;/a&gt;\". Set in 1984, Busby takes on the management of a boys' team entering in a local cup competition.\nCareer statistics.\nManagerial career.\n1Does not include matches &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Murphy%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Jimmy Murphy&lt;/a&gt; served as acting manager following the Munich air disaster.\nHonours.\nPlayer.\nManchester City\nManager.\nManchester United"
