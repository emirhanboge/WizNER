    "text": "The 1979 PGA Championship was the 61st &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Championship\"&gt;PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt;, played August 2\u20135 at &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Hills%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Oakland Hills Country Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bloomfield%20Township%2C%20Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Bloomfield Township, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb northwest of &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;. After a double-bogey on the 72nd hole, &lt;a href=\"David%20Graham%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;David Graham&lt;/a&gt; won the first of his two &lt;a href=\"Men%27s%20major%20golf%20championships\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; titles on the third hole of a sudden-death playoff with &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Crenshaw\"&gt;Ben Crenshaw&lt;/a&gt;. Through 17 holes in the final round, Graham was seven-under, with seven birdies and ten pars. Of the 21 holes he played Sunday, nine were birdies.\nAfter 54 holes, &lt;a href=\"Rex%20Caldwell\"&gt;Rex Caldwell&lt;/a&gt; was the leader at 203 (\u22127), Crenshaw was two strokes back and Graham four behind at 207 (\u22123), all in search of their first major title. It was the fifth runner-up finish for Crenshaw in a major, and second consecutive. He later won two majors, both at the &lt;a href=\"Masters%20Tournament\"&gt;Masters&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"1984%20Masters%20Tournament\"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1995%20Masters%20Tournament\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;; Graham won his second at the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1981%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Merion%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Merion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThree-time champion &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Snead\"&gt;Sam Snead&lt;/a&gt; set the record for the oldest player to make the &lt;a href=\"cut%20%28golf%29\"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; in a major. He was 67 years, 2 months, and 7 days of age at the cut and finished 42nd at 288 (+8). He won in &lt;a href=\"1942%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;1942&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1949%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"1951%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;1951&lt;/a&gt;, all in &lt;a href=\"match%20play\"&gt;match play&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was the sixth major championship held on the South Course, which previously hosted the PGA Championship in &lt;a href=\"1972%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;1972&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1924%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1924&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1937%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1937&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1951%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1951&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"1961%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt;. It later hosted the U.S. Open in &lt;a href=\"1985%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1996%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;, the PGA Championship in &lt;a href=\"2008%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Ryder%20Cup\"&gt;Ryder Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2004%20Ryder%20Cup\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis was the third consecutive playoff at the PGA Championship (and nearly the fourth, as the &lt;a href=\"1976%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;1976&lt;/a&gt; title was decided by the final putt on the 72nd green).\nGraham became the second &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n-born player to win the PGA Championship, preceded by &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Ferrier\"&gt;Jim Ferrier&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1947%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;1947&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Pate\"&gt;Jerry Pate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Watson%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Tom Watson&lt;/a&gt;, runners-up in the &lt;a href=\"1978%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;previous year's&lt;/a&gt; playoff, were tied with Graham in third place after 54 holes. Pate's 71 tied for fifth but Watson's 74 dropped him into a tie for twelfth at 281. Watson had won three of his eight majors at this time, but never completed the career &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Slam%20%28golf%29\"&gt;grand slam&lt;/a&gt;, missing the PGA Championship leg. Defending champion &lt;a href=\"John%20Mahaffey\"&gt;John Mahaffey&lt;/a&gt; tied for 51st.\nThis was the final major championship of the 1970s. &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Nicklaus\"&gt;Jack Nicklaus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Weiskopf\"&gt;Tom Weiskopf&lt;/a&gt; played in the event assuring that they played in every major championship in the 1970s. They were the first players to play in every major championship for an entire decade.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, August 2, 1979\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 3, 1979\"\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 4, 1979\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 5, 1979\"\nSource:\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;\nPlayoff.\nThe sudden-death playoff began at the first tee and Graham saved par with one putt from to tie.
