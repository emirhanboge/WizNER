    "text": "Ormsby MacKnight (or McKnight) Mitchel (August 28, 1810, or possibly 1809,October 31, 1862) was an American &lt;a href=\"astronomer\"&gt;astronomer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;major general&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nA multi-talented man, he was also an attorney, &lt;a href=\"surveying\"&gt;surveyor&lt;/a&gt;, professor, and publisher. He is notable for publishing the first magazine in the United States devoted to astronomy. Known in the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army\"&gt;Union Army&lt;/a&gt; as \"Old Stars\", he is best known for ordering the raid that became famous as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Locomotive%20Chase\"&gt;Great Locomotive Chase&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and career.\nMitchel was born in &lt;a href=\"Union%20County%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Union County, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, but grew up in &lt;a href=\"Lebanon%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Lebanon, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. He was educated in Lebanon, Ohio and afterward at &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;West Point&lt;/a&gt; in 1825, where he was a classmate to &lt;a href=\"Robert%20E.%20Lee\"&gt;Robert E. Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20E.%20Johnston\"&gt;Joseph E. Johnston&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated in 1829, placing 15th out of 46 graduates. Mitchel stayed at &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;West Point&lt;/a&gt; as assistant professor of mathematics for three years. After holding several military positions while studying law, he went to &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, passed the &lt;a href=\"bar%20examination\"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt; and became an attorney. He also filled the office of Chief Engineer of the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Miami%20Railroad\"&gt;Little Miami Railroad&lt;/a&gt;, then in process of construction. Subsequently, in 1836, he became Assistant Professor of mathematics, philosophy, and professor of &lt;a href=\"astronomy\"&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20College\"&gt;Cincinnati College&lt;/a&gt;, and during this incumbency achieved a national renown as an astronomical lecturer and builder of a great observatory (&lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Observatory\"&gt;Cincinnati Observatory&lt;/a&gt;). He was instrumental in establishing the college's law school, and on his first vacation, surveyed and recommended the route of the planned &lt;a href=\"Little%20Miami%20Railroad\"&gt;Little Miami Railroad&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Springfield%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Springfield, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;.\nConceiving a desire to possess a fine &lt;a href=\"telescope\"&gt;telescope&lt;/a&gt;, he began by striving to awaken interest in the subject of &lt;a href=\"astronomy\"&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt; through a series of lectures. The first was heard by 16 people; but the last was listened to by an enraptured audience of 2,000. Availing himself of the enthusiasm thus generated, he organized the Cincinnati Astronomical Society with 300 members at $25 each, and started for Europe to find his telescope. His search was long, but successful and, returning, he plunged into the struggle to secure a suitable &lt;a href=\"observatory\"&gt;observatory&lt;/a&gt;. In the person of the eccentric but immensely capable &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Longworth%20%28winemaker%29\"&gt;Nicholas Longworth&lt;/a&gt; he found a helpful coadjutor. Upon the land which was donated by Longworth (located on the summit of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Adams%2C%20Cincinnati\"&gt;Mt. Adams&lt;/a&gt;). Mitchel began the foundation of his building and &lt;a href=\"John%20Quincy%20Adams\"&gt;John Quincy Adams&lt;/a&gt;, then more than 77 years of age, delivered an address at the laying of the cornerstone.\nAt this period of undertaking, the plucky little professor (he was small in stature and most delicately formed) had collected $3,000, and $6,500 necessary to complete his work. The times were hard and the subscriptions came in so slowly that he determined to collect them in person. Where money could not be procured, he took provisions or anything in the world that had &lt;a href=\"negotiable%20instrument\"&gt;negotiable value&lt;/a&gt;. This \"&lt;a href=\"potpourri\"&gt;potpourri&lt;/a&gt;\" of valuables he marketed and turned into cash as best he could. Nor was this all that the indefatigable professor had to do. Many of his subscriptions being in work and materials no collectors would accept them as his assets and he undertook to make them available by buying all the materials, hiring all the men and superintending all the work, at which task he labored like a miniature &lt;a href=\"Titan%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;. The ascent to the place of construction was steep. Therefore, he built a &lt;a href=\"kiln\"&gt;kiln&lt;/a&gt; and burned the lime; he purchased a sand pit also and often shoveled its contents into the wagon with his own hands.\nThese herculean laborers, arduous as they were, constituted but the advocation of the busy man for, all the time, he carried on his classes, teaching five hours a day from eight until one. Each Saturday exhausted his funds and on Monday he had to begin collecting again. But, nothing daunted or discouraged the invincible enthusiast, he stuck resolutely to his task until it was done, and in March 1845 he had the satisfaction of hoisting his telescope into place. At the time, it was the second-largest &lt;a href=\"refracting%20telescope\"&gt;refracting telescope&lt;/a&gt; in the world. There was no salary attached to the office of astronomer in this new observatory and Mitchel supported himself by &lt;a href=\"civil%20engineering\"&gt;civil engineering&lt;/a&gt; on the route of the Ohio &amp; Mississippi Railroad (&lt;a href=\"Ohio%20and%20Mississippi%20Railway\"&gt;Ohio and Mississippi Railway&lt;/a&gt;) and by lecturing anywhere and everywhere. In 1853, he was elected as a member of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Philosophical%20Society\"&gt;American Philosophical Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor a time, Cincinnati lost his inspirational presence. In 1859, Mitchel accepted the position of astronomer of the &lt;a href=\"Dudley%20Observatory\"&gt;Dudley Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Albany, New York&lt;/a&gt; (a position which he held until 1861), where he continued his pioneering work on the development of telegraphic determination of &lt;a href=\"longitude\"&gt;longitude&lt;/a&gt;. Although, he did not wholly relinquish a connection with the one he had built in &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;.\nMitchel helped establish observatories for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;. He also published, in 1846, the first monthly magazine in the United States devoted specifically to astronomy, the \"Sidereal Messenger\", and other works including \"The Orbs of Heaven\" (1848 and later), and \"Popular Astronomy\" (1860).\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; broke out, Mitchel turned soldier. He happened to be in New York when the news of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter\"&gt;Battle of Fort Sumter&lt;/a&gt; came and, being asked to speak at a public meeting, poured out the deep emotions of his fervid soul in a passionate appeal whose eloquence produced an effect like that of the orations or &lt;a href=\"Demosthenes\"&gt;Demosthenes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Burke\"&gt;Burke&lt;/a&gt;. Men and women wept aloud; the cheering drowned his words and the speech he made has been regarded as worthy to be placed alongside &lt;a href=\"Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;abolitionist&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Lincoln\"&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Sumner\"&gt;Charles Sumner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wendell%20Phillips\"&gt;Wendell Phillips&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Ward%20Beecher\"&gt;Henry Ward Beecher&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis previous record and this address procured for Mitchel and high position in the Army and his career as a soldier began.\nCivil War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, he entered the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army\"&gt;Union Army&lt;/a&gt; with a commission as &lt;a href=\"Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;brigadier general&lt;/a&gt; of volunteers. He first organized the northern &lt;a href=\"Kentucky\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; defenses around &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;. He commanded the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20the%20Ohio\"&gt;Department of the Ohio&lt;/a&gt; from September to November 1861. During this time, he conspired with &lt;a href=\"espionage\"&gt;espionage&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href=\"James%20J.%20Andrews\"&gt;James J. Andrews&lt;/a&gt; on plans to steal a train in &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; and disrupt a railroad vital to the &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20Army\"&gt;Confederate States Army&lt;/a&gt; coincident with Mitchel's planned attack on &lt;a href=\"Chattanooga%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Chattanooga, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;. The raid failed, as did Mitchel's military operation. Andrews and a number of his men were captured. Andrews himself was among eight men who were tried in Chattanooga. They were hanged in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20of%20America\"&gt;Confederate&lt;/a&gt; forces, but were later buried in the &lt;a href=\"Chattanooga%20National%20Cemetery\"&gt;National Cemetery at Chattanooga&lt;/a&gt; in 1887.\nAlthough a military failure, the story of Andrew's Raid became known to American history as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Locomotive%20Chase\"&gt;Great Locomotive Chase&lt;/a&gt;, and has been retold in publications and film. The pursuit of Andrews' Raiders formed the basis of the &lt;a href=\"Buster%20Keaton\"&gt;Buster Keaton&lt;/a&gt; silent film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20General%20%281926%20film%29\"&gt;The General&lt;/a&gt;\" and a dramatic 1956 &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney\"&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt; film, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Locomotive%20Chase%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Great Locomotive Chase&lt;/a&gt;\". \nMitchel led a &lt;a href=\"division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Ohio\"&gt;Army of the Ohio&lt;/a&gt; from December 1861 to July 1862, and was placed in charge of the defense of &lt;a href=\"Nashville%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Nashville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, with headquarters in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Shelbyville%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Shelbyville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;. He became famous when he seized the city of &lt;a href=\"Huntsville%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Huntsville, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; in April 1862 without a shot being fired, after he led his troops there from Shelbyville in a surprise maneuver. He was promoted to &lt;a href=\"Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;major general&lt;/a&gt; for his efforts.\nIn September 1862, he assumed command of &lt;a href=\"X%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29\"&gt;X Corps&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20the%20South\"&gt;Department of the South&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hilton%20Head%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Hilton Head, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, but died in &lt;a href=\"Beaufort%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Beaufort&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"yellow%20fever\"&gt;yellow fever&lt;/a&gt; shortly after assuming his post. He is buried in &lt;a href=\"Green-Wood%20Cemetery\"&gt;Green-Wood Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Brooklyn, New York&lt;/a&gt;."
