    "text": "Boreopricea is an &lt;a href=\"extinct\"&gt;extinct&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"archosauromorph\"&gt;archosauromorph&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"reptile\"&gt;reptile&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Triassic\"&gt;Early Triassic&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"arctic\"&gt;arctic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. It is known from a fairly complete skeleton discovered in a borehole on &lt;a href=\"Kolguyev%20Island\"&gt;Kolguyev Island&lt;/a&gt;, though damage to the specimen and loss of certain bones has complicated study of the genus. \"Boreopricea\" shared many similarities with various other archosauromorphs, making its classification controversial. Various studies have considered it a close relative of \"&lt;a href=\"Prolacerta\"&gt;Prolacerta&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Tanystropheidae\"&gt;tanystropheids&lt;/a&gt;, both, or neither. \"Boreopricea\" is unique among early archosauromorphs due to possessing contact between the &lt;a href=\"Jugal%20bone\"&gt;jugal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Squamosal%20bone\"&gt;squamosal&lt;/a&gt; bones at the rear half of the skull.\nHistory.\n\"Boreopricea funerea\" was named and described by &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; paleontologist &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Petrovich%20Tatarinov\"&gt;L. P. Tatarinov&lt;/a&gt; in 1978. It was primarily based on a fairly complete skull and skeleton collected in 1972 from a &lt;a href=\"borehole\"&gt;borehole&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kolguyev%20Island\"&gt;Kolguyev Island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Ocean\"&gt;Arctic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=\"holotype\"&gt;holotype&lt;/a&gt; specimen, &lt;a href=\"Paleontological%20Institute%2C%20Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;PIN&lt;/a&gt; 3708/1, included bones from most of the body, apart from the hip area, the tip of the snout, and various miscellaneous missing fragments. During Tatarinov's preparation, the bones were removed from a slab of rock and glued onto a large piece of &lt;a href=\"card%20stock\"&gt;card stock&lt;/a&gt;, positioned as they originally were in the rock. Tatarinov also mentioned a second specimen, PIN 3708/2, which was a portion of the snout. However, this specimen could not be found by subsequent studies and is now considered lost. The rock layers preserving \"Boreopricea\" fossils hail from the &lt;a href=\"Ustmylian%20Gorizont\"&gt;Ustmylian Gorizont&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent portion of the &lt;a href=\"Vetlugian%20Supergorizont\"&gt;Vetlugian Supergorizont&lt;/a&gt;. The Ustmylian Gorizont is a regional &lt;a href=\"Biochronology\"&gt;biochronological&lt;/a&gt; zone which corresponds to the early &lt;a href=\"Olenekian\"&gt;Olenekian&lt;/a&gt; stage of the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Triassic\"&gt;Early Triassic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe genus was redescribed in 1997 by &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Bristol\"&gt;University of Bristol&lt;/a&gt; paleontologists &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Benton\"&gt;Michael Benton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Allen%20%28paleontologist%29\"&gt;Jackie Allen&lt;/a&gt;. They found that the specimen had been damaged during storage, as the skull was crushed and certain bones were missing (i.e. parts of the shoulder) or placed into odd positions (i.e. the hand). A plaster cast of the skull prior to its crushing was utilized for their description of the skull, but some areas, such as the &lt;a href=\"palate\"&gt;palate&lt;/a&gt; and braincase, eluded restudy. Further study of the specimen was undertaken as part of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Ezcurra\"&gt;Martin Ezcurra&lt;/a&gt;'s 2016 study on archosauromorph systematics.\nDescription.\n\"Boreopricea\" would have had a sprawling posture and a generalized lizard-like body shape, though with a longer neck than most modern lizards. Benton &amp; Allen (1997) estimated that \"Boreopricea\" had a total (snout tip to tail tip) length of 44.0 centimeters (17.3 inches), with a 2.9 cm (1.1 inch) skull and 23.0 cm (9.1 inch) inch tail, although these estimates are uncertain considering that the tip of the snout and large portions of the backbone are missing.\nSkull.\nThe skull had a broad snout, large &lt;a href=\"Orbit%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;orbits&lt;/a&gt; (eye sockets), and two temporal fenestrae (holes at the back of the skull) like other &lt;a href=\"diapsid\"&gt;diapsid&lt;/a&gt; reptiles. Bones which lie at the top edge of the head, such as the &lt;a href=\"Nasal%20bone\"&gt;nasal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frontal%20bone\"&gt;frontal bones&lt;/a&gt;, were rectangular. The &lt;a href=\"Parietal%20bone\"&gt;parietal bones&lt;/a&gt; are incomplete, but preserved portions contact the frontals along a straight edge without a parietal foramen (a hole in the skull, present in many reptiles, which houses the &lt;a href=\"pineal%20gland\"&gt;pineal gland&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Jugal%20bone\"&gt;jugal&lt;/a&gt; (cheek bone) was unusually shaped. It lacked a posterior process (lower rear prong), which meant that the &lt;a href=\"Infratemporal%20fenestra\"&gt;lower temporal fenestra&lt;/a&gt; was open from below. Conversely, the ascending process (upper rear prong) was elongated, stretching above the lower temporal fenestra to contact the &lt;a href=\"squamosal%20bone\"&gt;squamosal bone&lt;/a&gt; at the rear of the skull. This jugal-squamosal contact (unique to \"Boreopricea\" among early archosauromorphs) effectively barricades the &lt;a href=\"postorbital%20bone\"&gt;postorbital bone&lt;/a&gt; from the edge of the lower temporal fenestra. The lower jaw was long and slender. Teeth, when preserved, were conical, sharply pointed, and slightly curved.\nPostcranial skeleton.\nThe neck was somewhat elongated. A sequence of five cervical (neck) vertebrae were preserved, probably the third to seventh vertebrae in the backbone. They were longer and narrower towards the skull and shorter and wider towards the shoulder. The later cervical and dorsal (torso) vertebrae had two rib facets on each side: a large, outwards-projecting facet which was triangular in cross section, and a smaller, circular facet which barely projects at all. The upwards-projecting neural spines of the vertebrae were low. Cervicals had narrow neural spines while dorsals had neural spines which gradually expanded into teardrop-shaped structures when seen from above. These expansions on the neural spines have been termed mammillary processes. The caudal (tail) vertebrae were numerous; they were broader towards the base of the tail and much thinner towards the tip.\nThe &lt;a href=\"scapula\"&gt;scapula&lt;/a&gt; (shoulder blade) was very thin when seen head-on but large and boxy when seen from the side. Other shoulder bones, including a bony sternum, were described by Tatarinov (1978) but are now lost. The &lt;a href=\"humerus\"&gt;humerus&lt;/a&gt; (upper arm bone) had a shape like a heavily twisted hourglass, with the long axis of the portion near the shoulder offset at a right angle from that of the portion near the elbow. The &lt;a href=\"ulna\"&gt;ulna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Radius%20%28bone%29\"&gt;radius&lt;/a&gt; (lower arm bones) were thin, curved rods like those of most other reptiles. &lt;a href=\"Third%20metacarpal%20bone\"&gt;Metacarpal III&lt;/a&gt; (the third bone of the hand) was as long as if not longer than &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20metacarpal%20bone\"&gt;metacarpal IV&lt;/a&gt; (the fourth bone of the hand), as with tanystropheids.\nHindlimb bones are overall fairly typical in structure, although the &lt;a href=\"femur\"&gt;femur&lt;/a&gt; (thigh bone) was broader than in most reptiles. The ankle was formed by four tightly-connected bones: the centrale, &lt;a href=\"Talus%20bone\"&gt;astragalus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calcaneus\"&gt;calcaneum&lt;/a&gt;, and distal &lt;a href=\"Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29\"&gt;tarsal&lt;/a&gt; IV. Although the astragalus and calcaneum were the most prominent bones in the ankle, all of the ankle bones were similar in size. \"Boreopricea\" also lacked a hole along the contact between the astragalus and calcaneum and the second &lt;a href=\"Phalanx%20bone\"&gt;phalanx&lt;/a&gt; (toe bone) of the fifth toe was long, both traits shared by tanystropheids. &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20metatarsal%20bone\"&gt;Metatarsal V&lt;/a&gt; (the fifth bone of the foot) was hook-shaped, as with various other archosauromorphs.\nClassification.\nWhen first described in 1978, \"Boreopricea\" was considered to be a \"prolacertiform\" reptile, meaning that its closest relatives were believed to be other long-necked lizard-like creatures such as \"&lt;a href=\"Prolacerta\"&gt;Prolacerta&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Macrocnemus\"&gt;Macrocnemus&lt;/a&gt;\". At this time, it was uncertain whether \"prolacertiforms\" were truly ancestral to modern &lt;a href=\"Lizard\"&gt;lizards&lt;/a&gt;, or alternatively closer to &lt;a href=\"Archosaur\"&gt;archosaurs&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Crocodilia\"&gt;crocodilians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1980s, &lt;a href=\"cladistics\"&gt;cladistics&lt;/a&gt; helped to clarify some aspects of reptile classification, and analyses by &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Gauthier\"&gt;Jacques Gauthier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Benton\"&gt;Michael Benton&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Susan%20E.%20Evans\"&gt;Susan Evans&lt;/a&gt; found substantial evidence that \"prolacertiforms\" were &lt;a href=\"Archosauromorpha\"&gt;archosauromorphs&lt;/a&gt; (closer to archosaurs) rather than &lt;a href=\"Lepidosauromorpha\"&gt;lepidosauromorphs&lt;/a&gt; (closer to lizards). Some of these analyses featured or mentioned \"Boreopricea\". Benton (1985) noted that \"Boreopricea\" was probably a prolacertid, but differed from \"Prolacerta\" due to the shape of its &lt;a href=\"Nasal%20bone\"&gt;nasal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Squamosal%20bone\"&gt;squamosal&lt;/a&gt; bones. Evans (1988) placed \"Boreopricea\" as an intermediate branch between \"Prolacerta\", which was closer to the base of the \"prolacertiform\" group, and \"Macrocnemus\", which was closer to the most derived and bizarre \"prolacertiforms\", the &lt;a href=\"Tanystropheidae\"&gt;tanystropheids&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe classification of \"Boreopricea\" and \"prolacertiforms\" in general was given further scrutiny in 1997. Benton &amp; Allen's redescription of the genus involved a phylogenetic analysis which found that \"Boreopricea\" was the &lt;a href=\"Sister%20group\"&gt;sister taxon&lt;/a&gt; to \"Prolacerta\", at least when superfluous and unstable data was cleared. \"Macrocnemus\" was not found to be close to either taxa; instead it was placed closer to the tanystropheids. &lt;a href=\"Nour-Eddine%20Jalil\"&gt;Nour-Eddine Jalil&lt;/a&gt; performed a very similar study that year, as part of his description of the African \"prolacertiform\" \"&lt;a href=\"Jesairosaurus\"&gt;Jesairosaurus&lt;/a&gt;\". In contrast to Benton &amp; Allen, Jalil's study placed \"Boreopricea\" deep within Tanystropheidae and unrelated to \"Prolacerta\". Some traits of \"Boreopricea\", such as a reduced posterior process of the jugal, were shared by both \"Prolacerta\" and tanystropheids. \"Boreopricea\" shared certain adaptations of the hands and feet with only tanystropheids, yet the shape of its scapula was closer to that of \"Prolacerta\".\nA landmark study by &lt;a href=\"David%20Dilkes\"&gt;David Dilkes&lt;/a&gt; in 1998 found that \"Prolacerta\" was more closely related to &lt;a href=\"Archosauriformes\"&gt;archosauriforms&lt;/a&gt; rather than tanystropheids, dissolving the concept of a &lt;a href=\"Monophyly\"&gt;monophyletic&lt;/a&gt; \"Prolacertiformes\" (i.e. a group where \"Prolacerta\" and tanystropheids had a common ancestor to the exception of archosaurs). \"Boreopricea\" would not be analyzed under this new framework until 2016, when it was restudied by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Ezcurra\"&gt;Martin Ezcurra&lt;/a&gt;. Ezcurra did not consider \"Boreopricea\" close to tanystropheids, instead he found that it was an archosauriform relative, nearly as close as \"Prolacerta\". Some features visible in \"Boreopricea\" which justify this placement include the presence of mammillary processes and a heavily twisted humerus. Ezcurra also named a new group, Crocopoda, which includes all archosauromorphs closer to archosaurs than to tanystropheids. \"Boreopricea\" was part of this new grouping, which also included &lt;a href=\"Rhynchosaur\"&gt;rhynchosaurs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Allokotosauria\"&gt;allokotosaurs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archosauriformes\"&gt;archosauriforms&lt;/a&gt;, and various other archosauriform-like reptiles, such as \"Prolacerta\".\nThe following cladogram is based on Ezcurra's 2016 study.\nA 2017 study by &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Pritchard\"&gt;Adam Pritchard&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Sterling%20Nesbitt\"&gt;Sterling Nesbitt&lt;/a&gt; slightly shifted the position of \"Boreopricea\", placing it closer to &lt;a href=\"Allokotosauria\"&gt;allokotosaurs&lt;/a&gt; rather than \"Prolacerta\" and archosauriforms.\nPaleoecology.\n&lt;a href=\"Ustmylian\"&gt;Ustmylian&lt;/a&gt; (or Ustmylskian) layers of Russian &lt;a href=\"biostratigraphy\"&gt;biostratigraphy&lt;/a&gt; record a lakeside environment filled with animals recovering and diversifying after the &lt;a href=\"Permian%E2%80%93Triassic%20extinction%20event\"&gt;Permian-Triassic extinction event&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest mass extinction in the history of the earth. The most common fossils at this time and place were freshwater amphibians such as \"&lt;a href=\"Wetlugasaurus\"&gt;Wetlugasaurus malachovi&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Vladlenosaurus\"&gt;Vladlenosaurus alexeyevi&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Vyborosaurus\"&gt;Vyborosaurus mirus&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Angusaurus\"&gt;Angusaurus&lt;/a&gt;\". On land, the small omnivore niche was filled by a diverse assortment of endemic &lt;a href=\"Procolophonidae\"&gt;procolophonids&lt;/a&gt;, including \"&lt;a href=\"Timanophon\"&gt;Timanophon raridentatus&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Orenburgia\"&gt;Orenburgia bruma&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Lestanshoria\"&gt;Lestanshoria massiva&lt;/a&gt;\". The large predator niche was probably filled by early &lt;a href=\"Archosauriformes\"&gt;archosauriforms&lt;/a&gt; such as \"&lt;a href=\"Chasmatosuchus\"&gt;Chasmatosuchus magnus&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Tsylmosuchus\"&gt;Tsylmosuchus jakovlevi&lt;/a&gt;\". These layers also preserved fossils of \"&lt;a href=\"Scharschengia\"&gt;Scharschengia&lt;/a&gt;\", which may be one of the earliest &lt;a href=\"Rhynchocephalia\"&gt;rhynchocephalians&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"tuatara\"&gt;tuatara&lt;/a&gt; relatives). \"Boreopricea funerea\" probably filled a small carnivore niche alongside mammal-like &lt;a href=\"Therocephalia\"&gt;therocephalians&lt;/a&gt; as well as \"&lt;a href=\"Microcnemus%20efremovi\"&gt;Microcnemus efremovi&lt;/a&gt;\", a reptile which was similar to and probably closely related to it."
