    "text": "\"Love Touch\" is a song performed by &lt;a href=\"Rod%20Stewart\"&gt;Rod Stewart&lt;/a&gt; and written by &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Chapman\"&gt;Mike Chapman&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Knight\"&gt;Holly Knight&lt;/a&gt;, and Gene Black. It was released as a single in 1986 and peaked at #6 on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt;. The song is played over the end credits of the &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Redford\"&gt;Robert Redford&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Debra%20Winger\"&gt;Debra Winger&lt;/a&gt; romantic comedy \"&lt;a href=\"Legal%20Eagles\"&gt;Legal Eagles&lt;/a&gt;\" and is often listed with the subtitle \"Theme from \"&lt;a href=\"Legal%20Eagles\"&gt;Legal Eagles&lt;/a&gt;\"\" even though it doesn't appear on the film's soundtrack album, distributed by &lt;a href=\"MCA%20Records\"&gt;MCA Records&lt;/a&gt;. The song is a plea from someone who has been fighting with his lover, but is apologizing and asking for another chance to \"be good.\"\nAlthough it is among Stewart's most successful songs, he rarely performs \"Love Touch\" in concert. Stewart holds a low opinion of the song's lyrics, calling it \"one of the silliest songs I've ever recorded,\" in the liner notes of \"Encore: &lt;a href=\"The%20Very%20Best%20of%20Rod%20Stewart\"&gt;The Very Best of Rod Stewart&lt;/a&gt; Volume 2\"."
