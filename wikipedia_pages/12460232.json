    "text": "The Small Club World Cup () was a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; tournament held in &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; between 1952 and 1975 (with some journalists considering 1952\u201357 the period of greatest relevance, and the second period that took place between 1963 and 1975 as of minor relevance). In most of the occasions, the competition was played by four participants from Europe and South America. In the first period, &lt;a href=\"Lists%20of%20association%20football%20clubs\"&gt;clubs&lt;/a&gt; from three countries would win the tournament: Spain, Brazil and Colombia. Five clubs have won the trophy in this period: &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20CF\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20FC\"&gt;Sao Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Millonarios%20F.C.\"&gt;Millonarios&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sport%20Club%20Corinthians%20Paulista\"&gt;Corinthians&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Europeans Champions Clubs' Cup&lt;/a&gt; was started in &lt;a href=\"1955%E2%80%9356%20European%20Cup\"&gt;1955&lt;/a&gt;, the Venezuelan competition lost importance and was discontinued in 1957. Although the tournament was relaunched in 1963, its relevance decreased as the &lt;a href=\"Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29\"&gt;Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt; (first held in &lt;a href=\"1960%20Intercontinental%20Cup\"&gt;1960&lt;/a&gt;) was then established as the major, official intercontinental competition for both South American and European clubs. During the 1963\u201375 period, the trophy was also named \"Copa Ciudad de Caracas\".\nThis competition is considered by some journalists as a predecessor of &lt;a href=\"Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29\"&gt;Intercontinental Cup&lt;/a&gt;, in that it regularly featured clubs from Europe and South America. However, there has come to light no 1952\u20131960 original source indicating that it had any influence for the creation of the Intercontinental Cup, or that is was effectively hailed in 1952\u20131957 as a club world trophy. Nevertheless, some clubs like Real Madrid highlight this trophy in their history or trophy section of their web-sites and publications."
