    "text": "James Scott Bowerbank (14 July 1797 \u2013 8 March 1877) was a British &lt;a href=\"Natural%20history\"&gt;naturalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"palaeontologist\"&gt;palaeontologist&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBowerbank was born in &lt;a href=\"Bishopsgate\"&gt;Bishopsgate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, and succeeded in conjunction with his brother to his father's distillery, in which he was actively engaged until 1847.\nIn early years &lt;a href=\"astronomy\"&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt; and natural history, especially &lt;a href=\"botany\"&gt;botany&lt;/a&gt;, engaged much of his attention; he became an enthusiastic worker at the &lt;a href=\"microscope\"&gt;microscope&lt;/a&gt;, studying the structure of &lt;a href=\"animal%20shell\"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"moss%20agate\"&gt;moss agate&lt;/a&gt;s, and flints. He also formed an extensive collection of fossils. The organic remains of the &lt;a href=\"London%20Clay\"&gt;London Clay&lt;/a&gt; attracted particular attention, and about the year 1836 he and six other workers founded The London Clay Club \u2013 the members comprising Dr Bowerbank, &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Erasmus%20Edwards\"&gt;Frederick E. Edwards&lt;/a&gt; (1799\u20131875), author of \"The Eocene Mollusca\" (&lt;a href=\"Palaeontographical%20Society\"&gt;Palaeontograph. Soc.&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Searles%20Valentine%20Wood\"&gt;Searles Valentine Wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Morris%20%28geologist%29\"&gt;John Morris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20White%20%28zoologist%29\"&gt;Alfred White (zoologist)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nathaniel%20Wetherell\"&gt;N. T. Wetherell&lt;/a&gt;, surgeon of Highgate (1800\u20131875), and &lt;a href=\"James%20De%20Carle%20Sowerby\"&gt;James De Carle Sowerby&lt;/a&gt;. In 1840, Bowerbank published \"A History of the Fossil Fruits and Seeds of the London Clay\", and two years later he was elected &lt;a href=\"Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society\"&gt;Fellow of the Royal Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1847 he suggested the establishment of a society for the publication of undescribed British Fossils, and thus originated the &lt;a href=\"Palaeontographical%20Society\"&gt;Palaeontographical Society&lt;/a&gt;. From 1844 until 1864 he did much to encourage a love of natural science by being at home every Monday evening at his residence in Park Street, &lt;a href=\"Islington\"&gt;Islington&lt;/a&gt;, and afterwards in &lt;a href=\"Highbury%20Grove\"&gt;Highbury Grove&lt;/a&gt;, where the treasures of his museum, his 4 microscopes, and his personal assistance were at the service of every earnest student. He became specially interested in the study of &lt;a href=\"sea%20sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;s, and he was author of \"A Monograph of the British Spongiadae\" in 4 vols., published by the &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Society\"&gt;Ray Society&lt;/a&gt;, 1864\u20131882. He retired in 1864 to &lt;a href=\"St%20Leonards-on-Sea\"&gt;St Leonards-on-Sea&lt;/a&gt;, where he died on 8 March 1877."
