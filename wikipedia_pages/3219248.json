    "title": "Transgranular fracture",
    "text": "A transgranular fracture is a &lt;a href=\"fracture\"&gt;fracture&lt;/a&gt; that follows the edges of &lt;a href=\"crystal%20structure\"&gt;lattice&lt;/a&gt;s in a &lt;a href=\"granular%20material\"&gt;granular material&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring the &lt;a href=\"grain\"&gt;grain&lt;/a&gt;s in the individual lattices. This results in a fairly smooth looking fracture with fewer sharp edges than one that follows the changing grains. This can be visualized as several wooden &lt;a href=\"jigsaw%20puzzle\"&gt;jigsaw puzzle&lt;/a&gt; pieces with the grains showing, but with each piece having grains running in a different direction. A transgranular fracture follows the grains in the wood, not the edges of the puzzle pieces. This is opposed to an &lt;a href=\"intergranular%20fracture\"&gt;intergranular fracture&lt;/a&gt;."
