    "text": "American Scout Seamount appeared on &lt;a href=\"Nautical%20chart\"&gt;charts&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Atlantic%20ocean\"&gt;North Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; published during the 1950s. It was located near with a depth of 37 meters. Investigations by the &lt;a href=\"Woods%20Hole%20Oceanographic%20Institution\"&gt;Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution&lt;/a&gt; research vessel \"&lt;a href=\"RV%20Atlantis%20II\"&gt;Atlantis II&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1964 found no evidence that it existed. Extensive surveys by the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Naval%20Oceanographic%20Office\"&gt;U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office&lt;/a&gt; eventually disproved the existence of a seamount in the vicinity. A June 1966 bathymetric and magnetic survey by the new survey ship found no evidence of a seamount with no soundings less than but did find strong returns from the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Scattering%20Layer\"&gt;Deep Scattering Layer&lt;/a&gt; that could be mistaken for shoals."
