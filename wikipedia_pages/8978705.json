His childhood street bears the name \"Travis Simms Way\", named after his identical twin brother, &lt;a href=\"Travis%20Simms\"&gt;Travis Simms&lt;/a&gt;, who is a former two-time &lt;a href=\"World%20Boxing%20Association\"&gt;World Boxing Association&lt;/a&gt; junior middleweight champion. The mayor presented Simms with a key to the city.\nAmateur career.\nSimms had a stellar amateur career, compiling a record of 197 wins and seven defeats. He was a &lt;a href=\"National%20Golden%20Gloves%20champion\"&gt;National Golden Gloves champion&lt;/a&gt; in 1993 at Middleweight and defeated future super middleweight champion &lt;a href=\"Byron%20Mitchell\"&gt;Byron Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; as well as future Olympic medalist &lt;a href=\"Roshii%20Wells\"&gt;Roshii Wells&lt;/a&gt;.

Although he was undefeated for twelve years and rarely got hit due to his defensive skills, he saw limited action due to promotional difficulties. In 2005, he fought to a highly controversial draw in the hometown of Robert Frazier at the Turning Stone Casino in May, 2005. Following a two-year layoff, Simms won five straight fights before losing for the first time in late 2009 to title contender &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Green\"&gt;Allan Green&lt;/a&gt; by decision. Simms accepted the bout against Green on eight days' notice. After the close loss to Green, a bout which some ringsiders scored a draw, Simms signed with advisor Matt Yanofsky and inked a promotional deal with New Jersey\u2013based Main Events. He won two consecutive bouts heading into 2012, with his eye on another significant fight."
