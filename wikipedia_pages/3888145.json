    "text": "Reykjav\u00edk Airport (&lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20Language\"&gt;Icelandic&lt;/a&gt;: \"Reykjav\u00edkurflugv\u00f6llur\") is the main domestic airport serving &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, located about from the city centre.\nHaving shorter runways than the city's larger &lt;a href=\"international%20airport\"&gt;international airport&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Keflav%C3%ADk%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Keflav\u00edk International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, which is sited out of town, it only serves internal flights within Iceland and to &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, small international charters, transatlantic &lt;a href=\"ferry%20flight\"&gt;ferry flight&lt;/a&gt;s and private flights. It can also serve as alternate airport for flights inbound towards Keflav\u00edk, in case of adverse weather conditions there. To distinguish from the larger &lt;a href=\"Keflav%C3%ADk%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Keflav\u00edk International Airport&lt;/a&gt; outside Reykjav\u00edk, it is sometimes unofficially in English called \"Reykjavik City Airport\" (also by the airport administration), and also \"Reykjavik Domestic Airport\", but also \"Reykjav\u00edk international Airport\" because it has some international flights but mostly domestic ones.\nReykjav\u00edk Airport is the main &lt;a href=\"airline%20hub\"&gt;hub&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Air%20%28Iceland%29\"&gt;Eagle Air&lt;/a&gt; and the domestic hub of &lt;a href=\"Icelandair\"&gt;Icelandair&lt;/a&gt;, and it currently has two runways (as of January 2022). Reykjav\u00edk Airport is owned and operated by the state enterprise &lt;a href=\"Isavia\"&gt;Isavia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe first flight from the airport area was 3 September 1919, with the takeoff of an &lt;a href=\"Avro%20504\"&gt;Avro 504&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"aeroplane\"&gt;aeroplane&lt;/a&gt; in Iceland. Until 1937, there were experiments with airline operations in Vatnsm\u00fdri, but with the foundation of Iceland's oldest &lt;a href=\"airline\"&gt;airline&lt;/a&gt;, Flugf\u00e9lag Akureyrar (now &lt;a href=\"Icelandair\"&gt;Icelandair&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Akureyri\"&gt;Akureyri&lt;/a&gt; in 1938, operations began in the area and in March 1940 scheduled flights started when Flugf\u00e9lag Akureyrar moved its hub from Akureyri to Reykjav\u00edk (and changed its name to Flugf\u00e9lag \u00cdslands).\nThe current airport was built by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; on the south coast of the Reykjav\u00edk peninsula. Construction began in October 1940, when the airport had only a grass surface. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Watch\"&gt;Black Watch&lt;/a&gt; regiment built the first runway, constructing it over sunken oil barrels. The British &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; operated from the airport, then named &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Reykjavik\"&gt;RAF Reykjavik&lt;/a&gt;, from March 1941. On 6 July 1946, the British handed the airport operation over to the Icelandic government and since then it has been operated by the Icelandic Civil Aviation Authority (now Flugsto\u00f0ir).\nRenovation of the airport started in 2000 and lasted two years. This was followed by a &lt;a href=\"referendum\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, with 49.3% of the votes for moving the airport out of the city centre, and 48.1% votes for it remaining in place until 2016, when the current urban plan expires. The outcome of these elections on the other hand was not binding because election participation was under 40% and the left wing majority made the decision to have such a clause for it to be binding and beyond that because these elections were not held properly in respect to certain legal technicalities that also resulted in no option for non-election day voting (for vacationers for example).\nAfter renovation, the width of runways 01/19 and 13/31 are 45\u00a0m and 06/24 is 30\u00a0m, with visual approach for runways 01 and 31, while runway 19 has ILS CAT I/NBD-DME approach and runway 13 has LLZ-DME/NDB-DME approach. The lights for the runways were updated with LIH Wedge for all runways. 06/24 is permanently closed and being used as a taxiway, as of 2020.\nFuture.\nThe city has grown around the airport and it is now located in the western part of the city. This location is considered inconvenient by many, for noise pollution and safety reasons and because it takes up a lot of otherwise useful area near downtown areas. There is an ongoing debate about the future of the airport, with the three options being: \nIn 2001 there was a local referendum in Reykjavik on the matter, keep Reykjav\u00edk Airport at present location or move air traffic elsewhere within 15 years, where the result was fairly equal but a small overweight (49.3% against 48.1%) for moving the traffic. However the turnout was only 37% and referendum was local, and Reykjav\u00edk Airport does remain both 15 and 20 years after 2001.\nTerminals.\nThere are two terminals located on different sides of the runway area: \nOther facilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Icelandair%20Group\"&gt;Icelandair Group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icelandair\"&gt;Icelandair&lt;/a&gt; have a head office at the airport. &lt;a href=\"Isavia\"&gt;Isavia&lt;/a&gt; also have their head offices on the airport property. When &lt;a href=\"Loftlei%C3%B0ir\"&gt;Loftlei\u00f0ir&lt;/a&gt; was in operation, its head office was at the airport.\nGround transportation.\nThere are some local city buses at both terminal buildings. BS\u00cd is a major bus terminal, located 1.6\u00a0km (1.0\u00a0mi) from the main airport terminal. At the bus terminal, &lt;a href=\"Str%C3%A6t%C3%B3%20bs\"&gt;Str\u00e6t\u00f3&lt;/a&gt; provides bus service to areas around Reykjavik while Gray Line Iceland Excursions' Airportexpress and Reykjavik Excursions Kynnisfer\u00f0ir's Flybus services connect between &lt;a href=\"Keflav%C3%ADk%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Keflav\u00edk International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and Reykjavik Airport.\nWhen changing between domestic and international flights a 50\u00a0km bus transfer between Reykjav\u00edk Airport and Keflav\u00edk International Airport is usually needed, and at least three hours between flights is recommended."
