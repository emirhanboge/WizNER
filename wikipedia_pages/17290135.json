    "text": "The 1956 U.S. Open was the 56th &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt;, held June 14\u201316 at the East Course of &lt;a href=\"Oak%20Hill%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Oak Hill Country Club&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Rochester%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Rochester, New York&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cary%20Middlecoff\"&gt;Cary Middlecoff&lt;/a&gt; won his second U.S. Open title, one stroke ahead of runners-up &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Boros\"&gt;Julius Boros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Hogan\"&gt;Ben Hogan&lt;/a&gt;, both former champions.\nMiddlecoff began the final round with a two-stroke lead over Hogan, &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Kroll\"&gt;Ted Kroll&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wes%20Ellis\"&gt;Wes Ellis&lt;/a&gt;. After an erratic finish where he bogeyed 16 and 17, he carded a third consecutive round of even-par 70 to post a 281 (+1) total and waited. Hogan, pursuing his record fifth U.S. Open, had a chance to tie Middlecoff but missed a par putt on the 17th to finish one back. Boros also had a chance to catch Middlecoff, but missed a birdie on the last and also finished a stroke behind. The last contender on the course, Kroll led by a stroke after a birdie at the 14th hole, but immediately followed it with a bogey and triple bogey and finished four strokes back.\nReigning &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;British Open&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Thomson%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Peter Thomson&lt;/a&gt; made a rare appearance in the United States and finished tied for fourth, his best finish at any other &lt;a href=\"Men%27s%20major%20golf%20championships\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;. He was the 36-hole leader by a stroke over Hogan, but fell back after a four-over 39 on the back nine in the third round. Thomson won five British Opens, and his third consecutive (&lt;a href=\"1954%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;1954&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"1956%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;) came three weeks later at &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Liverpool%20Golf%20Club%2C%20Hoylake\"&gt;Royal Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;. \nSeveral future champions made their mark at this U.S. Open. &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Palmer\"&gt;Arnold Palmer&lt;/a&gt;, 26, recorded the first of his thirteen top ten finishes at the U.S. Open, six strokes back in seventh place. &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Venturi\"&gt;Ken Venturi&lt;/a&gt; captured low-&lt;a href=\"Amateur%20sports%23Golf\"&gt;amateur&lt;/a&gt; honors in eighth place, two months after he lost a four-stroke lead at &lt;a href=\"1956%20Masters%20Tournament\"&gt;The Masters&lt;/a&gt; with an 80 in the final round. &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Casper\"&gt;Billy Casper&lt;/a&gt;, 24, made his major championship debut and finished 14th. \nDefending champion &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Fleck\"&gt;Jack Fleck&lt;/a&gt;, who upset Hogan in a Sunday playoff the &lt;a href=\"1955%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;year before&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Club\"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt;, shot 76-74 and missed the cut by a stroke. &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Burke%20Jr.\"&gt;Jack Burke Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, winner of the &lt;a href=\"1956%20Masters%20Tournament\"&gt;Masters&lt;/a&gt; two months earlier, also missed with a 152.\nA record-setting 13,914 were in attendance for the final two rounds on Saturday.\nThis was the first of three U.S. Opens at the East Course at Oak Hill; &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Trevino\"&gt;Lee Trevino&lt;/a&gt; won in &lt;a href=\"1968%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curtis%20Strange\"&gt;Curtis Strange&lt;/a&gt; successfully defended in &lt;a href=\"1989%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1989&lt;/a&gt;.
