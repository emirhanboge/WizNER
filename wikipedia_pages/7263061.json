    "text": "James Byron Gordon (November 2, 1822 \u2013 May 18, 1864) was a &lt;a href=\"Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;brigadier general&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20Army\"&gt;Confederate States Army&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. He was killed in action at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Meadow%20Bridge\"&gt;Battle of Meadow Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nGordon was born in &lt;a href=\"Wilkes%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Wilkes County, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; to Nathaniel and Sarah Gwyn Gordon. James B. Gordon was a distant cousin of Confederate General &lt;a href=\"John%20Brown%20Gordon\"&gt;John Brown Gordon&lt;/a&gt;. After studying at &lt;a href=\"Emory%20and%20Henry%20College\"&gt;Emory and Henry College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Emory%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Emory, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, he returned to Wilkes County and became a successful mercantile businessman and a prominent member of the community. He served several terms as a Wilkes County commissioner and spent one term in the North Carolina state legislature.\nCivil War.\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Gordon enlisted as a &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the \"Wilkes County Guards\". This unit was merged into the &lt;a href=\"1st%20North%20Carolina%20Infantry%20Regiment\"&gt;1st North Carolina Infantry Regiment&lt;/a&gt;. Gordon went to the cavalry and was promoted to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28land%20and%20air%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=\"Major%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20North%20Carolina%20Cavalry%20Regiment\"&gt;1st North Carolina Cavalry Regiment&lt;/a&gt;. He served under the command of famed Confederate cavalry general &lt;a href=\"J.E.B.%20Stuart\"&gt;J.E.B. Stuart&lt;/a&gt; for most of the war. On November 26, 1861, Gordon led the first charge of his regiment and won praise for his bravery from General Stuart. In early 1862, he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt;, and a year later was made a full &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt; of cavalry. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia\"&gt;Army of Northern Virginia&lt;/a&gt;'s retreat after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Gettysburg\"&gt;Battle of Gettysburg&lt;/a&gt; in July 1863, Colonel Gordon defeated &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army\"&gt;Union forces&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hagerstown%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Hagerstown, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, thereby helping the Confederates escape into Virginia. In September 1863, he was promoted to brigadier general and assigned command of the North Carolina Cavalry Brigade. He defeated Union troops in a battle near &lt;a href=\"Culpeper%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Culpeper Court House&lt;/a&gt; in October 1863, but was seriously wounded shortly afterwards. In May 1864, Gordon joined with other Confederate cavalry units under J.E.B. Stuart to halt the advance of Union &lt;a href=\"Major%20General\"&gt;Maj. Gen.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Sheridan\"&gt;Philip Sheridan&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Richmond, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, the Confederate capital.\nDeath.\nOn May 11 Stuart was killed in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Yellow%20Tavern\"&gt;Battle of Yellow Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, and Gordon assumed the role of defending Richmond. On May 12, 1864, Gordon's cavalry held Sheridan's troops at Meadow Bridge, just north of Richmond, long enough for Confederate reinforcements to arrive and save the city. However, Gordon was mortally wounded in this battle and died within a week. He was buried with full military honors in the cemetery of St. Paul's Episcopal church in &lt;a href=\"Wilkesboro%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Wilkesboro, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;."
