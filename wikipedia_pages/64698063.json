Since its foundation party accepted a &lt;a href=\"Centre-right%20politics\"&gt;centre-right&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"populist\"&gt;populist&lt;/a&gt; discourse, advocating &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20conservatism\"&gt;moderate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cultural%20conservatism\"&gt;cultural conservatism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anti-corruption\"&gt;anti-corruption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20of%20religion%20in%20Montenegro\"&gt;rights in Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rule%20of%20law\"&gt;rule of law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"decentralisation\"&gt;decentralisation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"labour%20rights\"&gt;labour rights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"agrarianism\"&gt;agrarianism&lt;/a&gt;. Party failed to achieve a significant result in competition with another right-wing populist list led by &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Front%20%28Montenegro%29\"&gt;Democratic Front&lt;/a&gt; alliance, which enjoyed support by the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Progressive%20Party\"&gt;SNS-led regime in Serbia&lt;/a&gt;. SNS-controlled media and its affiliated political outlets in Serbia, Montenegro and &lt;a href=\"Republika%20Srpska\"&gt;Republika Srpska&lt;/a&gt; publicly supported Democratic Front-led list, launching a negative campaign to discredit Davidovi\u0107 and his newly-formed party, as direct competition seeking support from the same voter base, among local Serb community. Davidovi\u0107's party continued to operate locally within Nik\u0161i\u0107 municipality, where it currently has a single representative in the 41-seat assembly."
