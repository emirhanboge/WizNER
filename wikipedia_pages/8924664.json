    "text": "Chang Chih-chiang (, born 22 October 1978 in &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;) is a Taiwanese baseball pitcher for &lt;a href=\"Uni-President%20Lions\"&gt;Uni-President Lions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Professional%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Chinese Professional Baseball League&lt;/a&gt; (CPBL). He got his first career win on 7 July 2005. He is a starting pitcher for the Lions. Because of his resemblance to &lt;a href=\"Genji%20Kaku\"&gt;Kuo Yuen-chih&lt;/a&gt;, a famous Taiwanese baseball player who had a successful baseball career in Japan before retiring, he was assigned the number 33, the same number Kuo wore during almost his entire career. He is nicknamed by fans as \"Ban-chang\" (, literally \"squad leader\") due to his experience in the army. Teammate &lt;a href=\"Wang%20Tzu-sung\"&gt;Wang Tzu-sung&lt;/a&gt; also served in his squad while in the army."
