    "text": "The Central League is a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; league for &lt;a href=\"reserve%20team\"&gt;reserve team&lt;/a&gt;s, primarily from the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;English Football League&lt;/a&gt;. For sponsorship purposes, it was branded as the Final Third Development League until the 2015/16 season.\nThe league was formed in 1911 and in its early years consisted of a mix of first teams and reserve teams. However, when the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North\"&gt;Football League Third Division North&lt;/a&gt; was created in 1921, all the first teams in the Central League became founder members.\nSince then, the league has been for reserve teams only, and eventually expanded to include virtually every professional team in the South, Midlands and North of England. Southern teams used to play in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Combination\"&gt;Football Combination&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years, the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20Reserve%20League\"&gt;Premier Reserve League&lt;/a&gt; was created for reserve sides of &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; teams, and so the Central League's membership has been reduced.\nFrom the 2006/07 season the FA Premier Reserve League was restricted to the reserve sides of FA Premier League clubs. This meant that the reserve sides of Championship clubs rejoined the Central League.\nTeams are not promoted to the Premier Reserve League based on their final league position, but on the league position of their respective clubs' senior teams. If the senior team is promoted to the Premier League, then the reserve team is promoted to the Premier Reserve League and replaced by the reserve teams of the relegated clubs.\nIt was announced on 31 December 2013 that the Central League secured a sponsorship arrangement with Final Third Sports Media, and was known as the 'Final Third Development League' with immediate effect for two seasons. \nOn 11 June 2014, it was announced that the league would expand to become a national competition by running a division in the south of the country for the 2014/15 season for the first time. \nChampions.\n1911\u20132020.\n+ - Three divisions, overall winner decided after a series of play-offs.\n^ - Three divisions, overall winner is the team with the best points per game ratio.\n~ - Two divisions, overall winner is the team with the best points per game ratio.\nCentral League Cup.\nSince 1996 the league has also operated a cup competition \u2013 The Central League Cup."
