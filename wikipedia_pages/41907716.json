    "text": "This is a list of warships sunk during the Russo-Japanese War.\nCauses of Japanese and Russian Warships sunk during the war.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s, and steel battleships had existed for many years, the Russo-Japanese war was the first conflict to see mature forms of these &lt;a href=\"weapon%20systems\"&gt;weapon systems&lt;/a&gt; deployed in large numbers. Over a hundred of the newly invented &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s and nearly the same number of &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat%20destroyer\"&gt;torpedo boat destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s were involved. The Imperial Russian Navy would become the first navy in history to possess an \"independent operational submarine fleet\" on 1 January 1905. With this submarine fleet making its first combat patrol on 14 February 1905, and its first clash with enemy surface warships on 29 April 1905, all this nearly a decade before World War I even began.\nDuring the course of the war, the Imperial Russian Navy (IRN) and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) would launch nearly 300 self-propelled automotive torpedoes at one another. Dozens of warships would be hit and damaged, but only 1 battleship, 2 armoured cruisers, and 2 destroyers would be permanently sunk (not salvaged). Another 80 plus warships would be destroyed by the traditional gun, mine, or other cause. The Russian battleship &lt;a href=\"Russian%20battleship%20Oslyabya\"&gt;\"Oslyabya\"&lt;/a&gt; was the first modern battleship sunk by gunfire alone, and Admiral &lt;a href=\"Rozhestvensky\"&gt;Rozhestvensky&lt;/a&gt;'s flagship, the battleship &lt;a href=\"Russian%20battleship%20Knyaz%20Suvorov\"&gt;\"Knyaz Suvorov\"&lt;/a&gt; was the first modern battleship sunk by the new \"torpedo\" on the high seas.\nVessel type and cause of loss.\nThe above data includes vessels that were sunk and consequently salvaged (raised) and put back into service by either combatant. Data regarding surface vessels either shipwrecked or scuttled was excluded.\nRussian warships sunk.\nFrom 1880 through the end of the war, Russia prepared a systematic plan to build their navy into a major naval power, able to meet any modern adversary\u2014which during this time period were primarily based in Europe. By 1884 Russia lead the world in numbers of the newly invented &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boats\"&gt;torpedo boats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat%20destroyer\"&gt;torpedo boat destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s with 115 such vessels. By 1904, the IRN was a first rate navy, but by the end of 1905, Russia was reduced to a third rate naval power.\nWarship type, name, and date of loss.\nThe list below excludes captured, surrendered, or sunken warships that were raised and put back into service by either combatant."
