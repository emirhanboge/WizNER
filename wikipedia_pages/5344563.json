    "text": "The Unauthorised History of New Zealand is a &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; comedic history talk show series that tells the \"real truth\" behind the &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;history of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of the archive footage seen on the show has never been seen on television before because it was deemed too shocking by TV executives to screen at the time. Some material created for the programme, including the 1920s-style animated series &lt;a href=\"Happy%20Hori\"&gt;Happy Hori&lt;/a&gt;, is presented as though it were archival.\nThe series does not tackle history chronologically, instead each episode explored a topic.\nThis country was shaped by visitors and the first episode examines the impact of such diverse guests as sheep, &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Sanders\"&gt;Colonel Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shah%20of%20Iran\"&gt;Shah of Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20Ali\"&gt;Muhammad Ali&lt;/a&gt; on New Zealand. Famous troublemakers such as &lt;a href=\"Hongi%20Hika\"&gt;Hongi Hika&lt;/a&gt;, the Ingham Twins and the Neil Roberts' (the &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Roberts%20%28anarchist%29\"&gt;suicide bomber&lt;/a&gt; and the TV producer) feature in an episode devoted to Trouble.\nOther episodes in the series consider some of the country's most powerful people, its legends, and reveal some of the most shocking and sexiest moments in the nation's history."
