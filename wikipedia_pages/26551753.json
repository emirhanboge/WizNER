    "text": "Richard Devon (born Richard Gibson Ferraiole, December 11, 1926 \u2013 February 26, 2010) was an American &lt;a href=\"character%20actor\"&gt;character actor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voice%20acting\"&gt;voice actor&lt;/a&gt; who between the late 1940s and 1991 performed in hundreds of roles on stage, radio, television, and in feature films.\nEarly life.\nDevon was born in &lt;a href=\"Glendale%2C%20California\"&gt;Glendale, California&lt;/a&gt; in 1926, the only son of four children of Florence H. (n\u00e9e Glass) and Luca Ferraiole. His father, a native of Italy, immigrated to the United States in 1901 and lived in Pennsylvania before moving to California, where by 1930 he was employed as a waiter in a Los Angeles cafe. To supplement his family's modest income, Devon later worked part-time as a stable boy and then as a riding instructor at an &lt;a href=\"Equestrianism\"&gt;equestrian&lt;/a&gt; academy in &lt;a href=\"Griffith%20Park\"&gt;Griffith Park&lt;/a&gt;. That early experience with horses proved useful in his acting career, especially in &lt;a href=\"Western%20%28genre%29\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; films and television series. Following his graduation from high school, Devon worked as a mail carrier at &lt;a href=\"Monogram%20Pictures\"&gt;Monogram Pictures&lt;/a&gt;, a laborer at a plant &lt;a href=\"plant%20nursery\"&gt;nursery&lt;/a&gt;, a mechanic's helper, and as a &lt;a href=\"Bouncer%20%28doorman%29\"&gt;doorman&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Palladium\"&gt;Hollywood Palladium&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nIn the 1950s Devon began performing as a character actor in many &lt;a href=\"Four%20Star%20Television\"&gt;Four Star Television&lt;/a&gt; series, although his work was not limited to a single production company or network.
