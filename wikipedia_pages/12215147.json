    "text": "Arthur Joseph Lopatka (May 28, 1919 \u2013 March 10, 2007) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"baseball%20player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, a left-handed &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; who worked in eight total &lt;a href=\"games%20pitched\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major Leagues&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1945%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;1945 St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"1946%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season\"&gt;1946 Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt;. The native of &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, stood tall and weighed .\nLopatka's professional career began in 1942 in the Cardinals' &lt;a href=\"farm%20system\"&gt;farm system&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"switch-hitter\"&gt;switch-hitter&lt;/a&gt;, he also played the &lt;a href=\"outfield\"&gt;outfield&lt;/a&gt; in the minors and &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batted&lt;/a&gt; .356 (with 26 &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; in 73 &lt;a href=\"at%20bats\"&gt;at bats&lt;/a&gt;) for the 1944 &lt;a href=\"Columbus%20Red%20Birds\"&gt;Columbus Red Birds&lt;/a&gt; of the top-level &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20%2820th%20century%29\"&gt;American Association&lt;/a&gt;.\nLopatka was recalled by the Cardinals in the closing weeks of the 1945 season. In his Major League debut on September 12, he drew the &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; assignment against the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Dodgers\"&gt;Brooklyn Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; and pitched a &lt;a href=\"complete%20game\"&gt;complete game&lt;/a&gt;, four-hit 3\u20132 victory at &lt;a href=\"Sportsman%27s%20Park\"&gt;Sportsman's Park&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the Dodgers' &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Branca\"&gt;Ralph Branca&lt;/a&gt;. That would represent Lopatka's only Major League victory. He worked in three more games for St. Louis in &lt;a href=\"relief%20pitcher\"&gt;relief&lt;/a&gt; in 1945, then was &lt;a href=\"waivers%20%28MLB%29\"&gt;waived&lt;/a&gt; to the Phillies prior to the start of the 1946 campaign. He pitched infrequently and ineffectively for the Phils. In his fourth and final appearance on July 1, 1946, he once again started against the Dodgers, but this time he lasted only one-third of an &lt;a href=\"inning%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt; and was charged with three &lt;a href=\"earned%20run\"&gt;earned run&lt;/a&gt;s, taking his second &lt;a href=\"decision%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; and first loss as Brooklyn won 11\u20136.\nIn his eight MLB games, Lopatka allowed 20 hits, seven &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt;, and 12 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run\"&gt;earned run&lt;/a&gt;s in 17 &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings pitched&lt;/a&gt;. He left baseball after the 1946 campaign."
