    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;, an inverse-square law is any &lt;a href=\"scientific%20law\"&gt;scientific law&lt;/a&gt; stating that a specified physical &lt;a href=\"quantity\"&gt;quantity&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Proportionality%20%28mathematics%29%23Inverse%20proportionality\"&gt;inversely proportional&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"square%20%28algebra%29\"&gt;square&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"distance\"&gt;distance&lt;/a&gt; from the source of that physical quantity. The fundamental cause for this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space.\n&lt;a href=\"Radar\"&gt;Radar&lt;/a&gt; energy expands during both the signal transmission and the &lt;a href=\"reflection%20%28physics%29\"&gt;reflected&lt;/a&gt; return, so the inverse square for both paths means that the radar will receive energy according to the inverse &lt;a href=\"fourth%20power\"&gt;fourth power&lt;/a&gt; of the range.\nTo prevent dilution of &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; while propagating a signal, certain methods can be used such as a &lt;a href=\"waveguide\"&gt;waveguide&lt;/a&gt;, which acts like a canal does for water, or how a gun barrel restricts hot gas expansion to one &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent loss of energy transfer to a &lt;a href=\"bullet\"&gt;bullet&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormula.\nMathematically notated (see &lt;a href=\"%E2%88%9D\"&gt;\u221d&lt;/a&gt;):\nformula_1\nIt can also be mathematically expressed as:\nformula_2\nor as the formulation of a constant quantity:\nformula_3\nThe &lt;a href=\"divergence\"&gt;divergence&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"vector%20field\"&gt;vector field&lt;/a&gt; which is the resultant of radial inverse-square law fields with respect to one or more sources is everywhere proportional to the strength of the local sources, and hence zero outside sources. &lt;a href=\"Newton%27s%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation\"&gt;Newton's law of universal gravitation&lt;/a&gt; follows an inverse-square law, as do the effects of &lt;a href=\"electricity\"&gt;electric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"radiation\"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt; phenomena.\nJustification.\nThe inverse-square law generally applies when some force, energy, or &lt;a href=\"flux\"&gt;other conserved quantity&lt;/a&gt; is evenly radiated outward from a &lt;a href=\"point%20source\"&gt;point source&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"three-dimensional%20space\"&gt;three-dimensional space&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"surface%20area\"&gt;surface area&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"sphere\"&gt;sphere&lt;/a&gt; (which is\u00a04\u03c0\"r\"2) is proportional to the square of the radius, as the &lt;a href=\"flux%20density\"&gt;emitted radiation&lt;/a&gt; gets farther from the source, it is spread out over an area that is increasing in proportion to the square of the distance from the source. Hence, the intensity of radiation passing through any unit area (directly facing the point source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source. &lt;a href=\"Gauss%27s%20law%20for%20gravity\"&gt;Gauss's law for gravity&lt;/a&gt; is similarly applicable, and can be used with any physical quantity that acts in accordance with the inverse-square relationship.\nOccurrences.\nGravitation.\n&lt;a href=\"Gravity\"&gt;Gravitation&lt;/a&gt; is the attraction between objects that have mass. Newton's law states:\nIf the distribution of matter in each body is spherically symmetric, then the objects can be treated as point masses without approximation, as shown in the &lt;a href=\"shell%20theorem\"&gt;shell theorem&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, if we want to calculate the attraction between massive bodies, we need to add all the point-point attraction forces vectorially and the net attraction might not be exact inverse square. However, if the separation between the massive bodies is much larger compared to their sizes, then to a good approximation, it is reasonable to treat the masses as a point mass located at the object's &lt;a href=\"center%20of%20mass\"&gt;center of mass&lt;/a&gt; while calculating the gravitational force.\nAs the law of gravitation, this &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%20universal%20gravitation\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; was suggested in 1645 by &lt;a href=\"Ismael%20Bullialdus\"&gt;Ismael Bullialdus&lt;/a&gt;. But Bullialdus did not accept &lt;a href=\"Kepler%27s%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion\"&gt;Kepler's second and third laws&lt;/a&gt;, nor did he appreciate &lt;a href=\"Christiaan%20Huygens\"&gt;Christiaan Huygens&lt;/a&gt;'s solution for circular motion (motion in a straight line pulled aside by the central force). Indeed, Bullialdus maintained the sun's force was attractive at aphelion and repulsive at perihelion. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Hooke\"&gt;Robert Hooke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Alfonso%20Borelli\"&gt;Giovanni Alfonso Borelli&lt;/a&gt; both expounded gravitation in 1666 as an attractive force (Hooke's lecture \"On gravity\" at the Royal Society, London, on 21 March; Borelli's \"Theory of the Planets\", published later in 1666). Hooke's 1670 Gresham lecture explained that gravitation applied to \"all celestiall bodys\" and added the principles that the gravitating power decreases with distance and that in the absence of any such power bodies move in straight lines. By 1679, Hooke thought gravitation had inverse square dependence and communicated this in a letter to &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton\"&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/a&gt;: \n\"my supposition is that the attraction always is in duplicate proportion to the distance from the center reciprocall\".\nHooke remained bitter about Newton claiming the invention of this principle, even though Newton's 1686 \"&lt;a href=\"Philosophi%C3%A6%20Naturalis%20Principia%20Mathematica\"&gt;Principia&lt;/a&gt;\" acknowledged that Hooke, along with Wren and Halley, had separately appreciated the inverse square law in the solar system, as well as giving some credit to Bullialdus.\nElectrostatics.\nThe force of attraction or repulsion between two electrically charged particles, in addition to being directly proportional to the product of the electric charges, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them; this is known as &lt;a href=\"Coulomb%27s%20law\"&gt;Coulomb's law&lt;/a&gt;. The deviation of the exponent from 2 is less than one part in 1015.\nformula_4\nLight and other electromagnetic radiation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"intensity%20%28physics%29\"&gt;intensity&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"illuminance\"&gt;illuminance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"irradiance\"&gt;irradiance&lt;/a&gt;) of &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; or other linear waves radiating from a &lt;a href=\"point%20source\"&gt;point source&lt;/a&gt; (energy per unit of area perpendicular to the source) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source, so an object (of the same size) twice as far away receives only one-quarter the &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; (in the same time period).\nMore generally, the irradiance, \"i.e.,\" the intensity (or &lt;a href=\"power%20%28physics%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; per unit area in the direction of &lt;a href=\"wave%20propagation\"&gt;propagation&lt;/a&gt;), of a &lt;a href=\"sphere\"&gt;spherical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wavefront\"&gt;wavefront&lt;/a&gt; varies inversely with the square of the distance from the source (assuming there are no losses caused by &lt;a href=\"absorption%20%28optics%29\"&gt;absorption&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"scattering\"&gt;scattering&lt;/a&gt;).\nFor example, the intensity of radiation from the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; is 9126 &lt;a href=\"watt\"&gt;watt&lt;/a&gt;s per square meter at the distance of &lt;a href=\"Mercury%20%28planet%29\"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt; (0.387 &lt;a href=\"Astronomical%20unit\"&gt;AU&lt;/a&gt;); but only 1367 watts per square meter at the distance of &lt;a href=\"Earth\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; (1 AU)\u2014an approximate threefold increase in distance results in an approximate ninefold decrease in intensity of radiation.\nFor non-&lt;a href=\"isotropic%20radiator\"&gt;isotropic radiator&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"parabolic%20antenna\"&gt;parabolic antenna&lt;/a&gt;s, headlights, and &lt;a href=\"laser\"&gt;laser&lt;/a&gt;s, the effective origin is located far behind the beam aperture. If you are close to the origin, you don't have to go far to double the radius, so the signal drops quickly. When you are far from the origin and still have a strong signal, like with a laser, you have to travel very far to double the radius and reduce the signal. This means you have a stronger signal or have &lt;a href=\"antenna%20gain\"&gt;antenna gain&lt;/a&gt; in the direction of the narrow beam relative to a wide beam in all directions of an &lt;a href=\"Isotropic%20radiator\"&gt;isotropic antenna&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"photography\"&gt;photography&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stage%20lighting\"&gt;stage lighting&lt;/a&gt;, the inverse-square law is used to determine the \"fall off\" or the difference in illumination on a subject as it moves closer to or further from the light source. For quick approximations, it is enough to remember that doubling the distance reduces illumination to one quarter; or similarly, to halve the illumination increase the distance by a factor of 1.4 (the &lt;a href=\"square%20root%20of%202\"&gt;square root of 2&lt;/a&gt;), and to double illumination, reduce the distance to 0.7 (square root of 1/2). When the illuminant is not a point source, the inverse square rule is often still a useful approximation; when the size of the light source is less than one-fifth of the distance to the subject, the calculation error is less than 1%.\nThe fractional reduction in electromagnetic &lt;a href=\"fluence\"&gt;fluence&lt;/a&gt; (\u03a6) for indirectly ionizing radiation with increasing distance from a point source can be calculated using the inverse-square law. Since emissions from a point source have radial directions, they intercept at a perpendicular incidence. The area of such a shell is 4\u03c0\"r\" 2 where \"r\" is the radial distance from the center. The law is particularly important in diagnostic &lt;a href=\"radiography\"&gt;radiography&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"radiotherapy\"&gt;radiotherapy&lt;/a&gt; treatment planning, though this proportionality does not hold in practical situations unless source dimensions are much smaller than the distance. As stated in &lt;a href=\"Fourier%20theory\"&gt;Fourier theory&lt;/a&gt; of heat \"as the point source is magnification by distances , its radiation is dilute proportional to the sin of the angle, of the increasing circumference arc from the point of origin\".\nExample.\nLet \"P\"\u00a0 be the total power radiated from a point source (for example, an omnidirectional &lt;a href=\"isotropic%20radiator\"&gt;isotropic radiator&lt;/a&gt;). At large distances from the source (compared to the size of the source), this power is distributed over larger and larger spherical surfaces as the distance from the source increases. Since the surface area of a sphere of radius \"r\" is \"A\"\u00a0=\u00a04\"\u03c0r\"\u00a02, the &lt;a href=\"intensity%20%28physics%29\"&gt;intensity&lt;/a&gt; \"I\" (power per unit area) of radiation at distance \"r\" is\nformula_5\nThe energy or intensity decreases (divided by\u00a04) as the distance \"r\" is doubled; if measured in &lt;a href=\"Decibel\"&gt;dB&lt;/a&gt; would decrease by 3.01\u00a0dB per doubling of distance. When referring to measurements of power quantities, a ratio can be expressed as a level in decibels by evaluating ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the measured quantity to reference value.\nSound in a gas.\nIn &lt;a href=\"acoustics\"&gt;acoustics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"sound%20pressure\"&gt;sound pressure&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"sphere\"&gt;spherical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wavefront\"&gt;wavefront&lt;/a&gt; radiating from a point source decreases by 50% as the distance \"r\" is doubled; measured in &lt;a href=\"Decibel\"&gt;dB&lt;/a&gt;, the decrease is still 6.02\u00a0dB, since dB represents an intensity ratio. The pressure ratio (as opposed to power ratio) is not inverse-square, but is inverse-proportional (inverse distance law):\nformula_6\nThe same is true for the component of &lt;a href=\"particle%20velocity\"&gt;particle velocity&lt;/a&gt; formula_7 that is &lt;a href=\"Phase%20%28waves%29%23In-phase%20and%20quadrature%20%28I%26amp%3BQ%29%20components\"&gt;in-phase&lt;/a&gt; with the instantaneous sound pressure formula_8:\nformula_9\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Near%20and%20far%20field\"&gt;near field&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"quadrature%20phase\"&gt;quadrature component&lt;/a&gt; of the particle velocity that is 90\u00b0 out of phase with the sound pressure and does not contribute to the time-averaged energy or the intensity of the sound. The &lt;a href=\"sound%20intensity\"&gt;sound intensity&lt;/a&gt; is the product of the &lt;a href=\"root%20mean%20square\"&gt;RMS&lt;/a&gt; sound pressure and the \"in-phase\" component of the RMS particle velocity, both of which are inverse-proportional. Accordingly, the intensity follows an inverse-square behaviour:\nformula_10\nField theory interpretation.\nFor an &lt;a href=\"irrotational%20vector%20field\"&gt;irrotational vector field&lt;/a&gt; in three-dimensional space, the inverse-square law corresponds to the property that the &lt;a href=\"divergence\"&gt;divergence&lt;/a&gt; is zero outside the source. This can be generalized to higher dimensions. Generally, for an irrotational vector field in \"n\"-dimensional &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20space\"&gt;Euclidean space&lt;/a&gt;, the intensity \"I\" of the vector field falls off with the distance \"r\" following the inverse (\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)th power law\nformula_11\ngiven that the space outside the source is divergence free. \nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"John%20Dumbleton\"&gt;John Dumbleton&lt;/a&gt; of the 14th-century &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20Calculators\"&gt;Oxford Calculators&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the first to express functional relationships in graphical form. He gave a proof of the &lt;a href=\"mean%20speed%20theorem\"&gt;mean speed theorem&lt;/a&gt; stating that \"the latitude of a uniformly difform movement corresponds to the degree of the midpoint\" and used this method to study the quantitative decrease in intensity of illumination in his \"Summa logic\u00e6 et philosophi\u00e6 naturalis\" (ca. 1349), stating that it was not linearly proportional to the distance, but was unable to expose the Inverse-square law.\nIn proposition 9 of Book 1 in his book \"Ad Vitellionem paralipomena, quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur\" (1604), the astronomer &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Kepler\"&gt;Johannes Kepler&lt;/a&gt; argued that the spreading of light from a point source obeys an inverse square law:\nIn 1645, in his book \"Astronomia Philolaica\" ..., the French astronomer &lt;a href=\"Isma%C3%ABl%20Bullialdus\"&gt;Isma\u00ebl Bullialdus&lt;/a&gt; (1605\u20131694) refuted Johannes Kepler's suggestion that \"gravity\" weakens as the inverse of the distance; instead, Bullialdus argued, \"gravity\" weakens as the inverse square of the distance:\nIn England, the Anglican bishop &lt;a href=\"Seth%20Ward%20%28bishop%20of%20Salisbury%29\"&gt;Seth Ward&lt;/a&gt; (1617\u20131689) publicized the ideas of Bullialdus in his critique \"In Ismaelis Bullialdi astronomiae philolaicae fundamenta inquisitio brevis\" (1653) and publicized the planetary astronomy of Kepler in his book \"Astronomia geometrica\" (1656).\nIn 1663\u20131664, the English scientist &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Hooke\"&gt;Robert Hooke&lt;/a&gt; was writing his book \"Micrographia\" (1666) in which he discussed, among other things, the relation between the height of the atmosphere and the barometric pressure at the surface. Since the atmosphere surrounds the earth, which itself is a sphere, the volume of atmosphere bearing on any unit area of the earth's surface is a truncated cone (which extends from the earth's center to the vacuum of space; obviously only the section of the cone from the earth's surface to space bears on the earth's surface). Although the volume of a cone is proportional to the cube of its height, Hooke argued that the air's pressure at the earth's surface is instead proportional to the height of the atmosphere because gravity diminishes with altitude. Although Hooke did not explicitly state so, the relation that he proposed would be true only if gravity decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the earth's center."
