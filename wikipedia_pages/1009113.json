    "text": "The Belarus national football team ( / \"Nacyjanalnaja zbornaja Bie\u0142arusi pa futbole\") represents &lt;a href=\"Belarus\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; in international &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and is controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Federation%20of%20Belarus\"&gt;Football Federation of Belarus&lt;/a&gt;, the governing body for &lt;a href=\"football%20in%20Belarus\"&gt;football in Belarus&lt;/a&gt;. Belarus' home ground is &lt;a href=\"Dinamo%20Stadium%20%28Minsk%29\"&gt;Dinamo Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Minsk\"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt;. Since independence in 1991, Belarus has not yet qualified for a &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20European%20Championship\"&gt;UEFA European Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter the split of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, Belarus played their first match against &lt;a href=\"Lithuania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; on 20 July 1992. Before that, several Belarusian players played for the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Soviet Union national team&lt;/a&gt;. The first &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt;-recognized international was a &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20game\"&gt;friendly&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Ukraine%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; on 28 October 1992, and their first win came in a match against &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; on 12 October 1994.\nBelarus have never qualified for either the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20European%20Championship\"&gt;UEFA European Championship&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the lack of any significant success during the 1990s, some notable results were still achieved, like a home win against the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%201996%20qualifying%20Group%205\"&gt;qualifiers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%201996\"&gt;Euro 1996&lt;/a&gt;, and two draws against eventual runners-up &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202000\"&gt;Euro 2000&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202000%20qualifying%20Group%201\"&gt;qualifiers&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder coach &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20Malofeyev\"&gt;Eduard Malofeyev&lt;/a&gt;, the team came very close to playing &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; in a play-off round to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2002 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, but were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; in the last &lt;a href=\"2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%E2%80%93%20UEFA%20Group%205\"&gt;group stage&lt;/a&gt; match, missing the chance to overtake &lt;a href=\"Ukraine%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, who drew their last game, finishing the group second behind &lt;a href=\"Poland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004\"&gt;Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004%20qualifying%20Group%203\"&gt;qualifying&lt;/a&gt; campaign was very unsuccessful as Belarus lost seven of their eight games. Around the same time, a generational change occurred and a number of players from the &lt;a href=\"Belarus%20national%20under-21%20football%20team\"&gt;U-21 team&lt;/a&gt; (which qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2004%20UEFA%20European%20Under-21%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;2004 European U-21 Championship&lt;/a&gt;) joined the senior national team. With each subsequent head coach (&lt;a href=\"Anatoly%20Baidachny\"&gt;Anatoly Baidachny&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yuri%20Puntus\"&gt;Yuri Puntus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bernd%20Stange\"&gt;Bernd Stange&lt;/a&gt;) the team improved their attacking skills. As a result, in each subsequent qualifying tournament starting with the &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Belarus scored more goals (total and average per game) than in previous campaigns. However, problems in defense and missed scoring opportunities prevented them from finishing higher than fourth in the group. Some notable results during this period, included a high-scoring 3\u20134 away loss to eventual World Cup winner &lt;a href=\"Italy%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; in the 2006 World Cup &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%E2%80%93%20UEFA%20Group%205\"&gt;qualifiers&lt;/a&gt; (the first time Italy conceded 3 goals in a home qualifying game since 1983), another home victory against the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202008\"&gt;Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202008%20qualifying%20Group%20G\"&gt;qualifiers&lt;/a&gt; as well as an away win and a home draw against &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202012\"&gt;Euro 2012&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202012%20qualifying%20Group%20D\"&gt;qualifiers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelarus achieved some success in minor tournaments. In 2002, the team defeated &lt;a href=\"Russia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ukraine%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; to win the &lt;a href=\"LG%20Cup%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;LG Cup&lt;/a&gt;. In 2004 and 2008, they won the 12th and &lt;a href=\"2008%20Malta%20International%20Football%20Tournament\"&gt;14th&lt;/a&gt; editions of the &lt;a href=\"Malta%20%28Rothmans%29%20International%20Tournament\"&gt;Malta International Tournament&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The first with its Olympic Squad, and the later with the first team (many starters were only available for the last game against &lt;a href=\"Malta%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;).\nDuring &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202020%20qualifying\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying&lt;/a&gt;, Belarus once again finished fourth in their group. With Belarus managing to top their group in the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Nations%20League%20D\"&gt;2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League D&lt;/a&gt;, it qualified for the country's first ever play-offs, and the team was scheduled to play against &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. However, they lost 1\u20130, the team missed out on a place at Euro 2020.\nTeam image.\nNickname.\nIn August 2016, the Football Federation announced that the national team's nickname would be the \"White Wings\". The name was influenced by the book &lt;a href=\"The%20Land%20Beneath%20White%20Wings\"&gt;The Land Beneath White Wings&lt;/a&gt; (1977) by famous Belarusian writer &lt;a href=\"Uladzimir%20Karatkevich\"&gt;Uladzimir Karatkevich&lt;/a&gt;. The BFF's new marketing and communications director, Uladzimir Berezhkov, said: \"We are looking at various ways of establishing links with our literary heritage and cultural traditions\", commenting that \"If the Belarusian people opt to associate the team with Karatkevich, almost every phrase in the book can be used as a hashtag!\"\nHome venue.\nThe team played the majority of its home matches at the &lt;a href=\"Dinamo%20Stadium%20%28Minsk%29\"&gt;Dinamo Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Minsk\"&gt;Minsk&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccasionally other venues are also used: &lt;a href=\"Molodechno\"&gt;Molodechno&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"City%20Stadium%20%28Molodechno%29\"&gt;City Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in May 1996 (friendly against &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Vitebsky%20Central%20Sport%20Complex\"&gt;Vitebsky Central Sport Complex&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vitebsk\"&gt;Vitebsk&lt;/a&gt; in November 2005 (friendly against &lt;a href=\"Latvia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Central%20Stadium%20%28Gomel%29\"&gt;Central Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gomel\"&gt;Gomel&lt;/a&gt; in October 2007 (&lt;a href=\"Euro%202008%20qualifying\"&gt;Euro 2008 qualifying&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Neman%20Stadium\"&gt;Neman Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grodno\"&gt;Grodno&lt;/a&gt; June 2009 (&lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29\"&gt;2010 World Cup qualifier&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Andorra%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Andorra&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Barysaw\"&gt;Borisov&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Haradzki%20Stadium\"&gt;City Stadium&lt;/a&gt; just a few days later (friendly against &lt;a href=\"Moldova%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Sport%20Complex%20Brestskiy\"&gt;Regional Sport Complex Brestskiy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brest%2C%20Belarus\"&gt;Brest&lt;/a&gt; in October 2009 (another 2010 World Cup qualifier against &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;) and in June 2018 (friendly against &lt;a href=\"Hungary%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Torpedo%20Stadium%20%28Zhodino%29\"&gt;Torpedo Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zhodino\"&gt;Zhodino&lt;/a&gt; in March 2021 (friendly against &lt;a href=\"Honduras%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;). \nIn late 2012 Dinamo Stadium was closed for renovation and the team started alternating between different home venues: &lt;a href=\"Central%20Stadium%20%28Gomel%29\"&gt;Central Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gomel\"&gt;Gomel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29\"&gt;2014 World Cup qualifiers&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Finland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Barysaw\"&gt;Borisov&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Haradzki%20Stadium\"&gt;City Stadium&lt;/a&gt; (friendly against &lt;a href=\"Kyrgyzstan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Torpedo%20Stadium%20%28Zhodino%29\"&gt;Torpedo Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zhodino\"&gt;Zhodino&lt;/a&gt; (friendlies against &lt;a href=\"Montenegro%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Japan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Traktor%20Stadium\"&gt;Traktor Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in Minsk (friendly against &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;).\nFrom 2014 until 2017 as well as in 2019 (UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying against &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;), Belarus played at &lt;a href=\"Borisov%20Arena\"&gt;Borisov Arena&lt;/a&gt;.

All green uniform or green jerseys/white shorts were used as away kits. Since qualifying campaign for &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt;, Belarus changed their primary colors to red jerseys and green shorts, and away kits to all white. In 2011, home colors were changed to all red.
