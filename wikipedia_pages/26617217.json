    "text": "While the most notable story coming out of 1968 was &lt;a href=\"1968%20Olympics%20Black%20Power%20salute\"&gt;socio-political&lt;/a&gt;, politics involved with the Olympics was not something unique to this year. However, the year marked the beginning of several emerging elements of contemporary &lt;a href=\"track%20and%20field\"&gt;track and field&lt;/a&gt;.\nAutomatic timing.\nWhile timing to the 100th of a second had been experimented with for many years, the &lt;a href=\"1968%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1968 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; were the first to use &lt;a href=\"fully%20automatic%20time\"&gt;Fully Automatic Timing&lt;/a&gt;, in not only athletics, but in canoeing, rowing, cycling, equestrian and swimming competitions. Subsequently, systems to record such times became more common and thus the accuracy of Fully Automatic Timing became mandated for World Record acceptance. While this rule was officially put into place in 1977, many 1968 records still stood as the first Automatically timed record.\nAll weather tracks.\nThis technology too had been developing, but &lt;a href=\"Tartan%20track\"&gt;Tartan track&lt;/a&gt;s were used as the competition surface for the first time at an Olympics. Since then an all-weather &lt;a href=\"running%20track\"&gt;running track&lt;/a&gt; was required for all top level competition. Subsequently, the inconsistency of the running surface became a significantly smaller factor in athletic performance.\nAltitude.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympics&lt;/a&gt; happening in &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;, at high altitude, the effect of the thin air on athletic performance became a factor on &lt;a href=\"world%20record\"&gt;world record&lt;/a&gt;s. This was already a known phenomenon, and the American team was selected by holding the &lt;a href=\"1968%20United%20States%20Olympic%20Trials%20%28track%20and%20field%29\"&gt;Olympic Trials&lt;/a&gt; at high altitude at &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Summit\"&gt;Echo Summit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. In 1955, &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Jones%20%28athlete%29\"&gt;Lou Jones&lt;/a&gt; set the &lt;a href=\"men%27s%20400%20metres%20world%20record%20progression\"&gt;world record in the 400 meters&lt;/a&gt; at altitude in Mexico City. Following the &lt;a href=\"1968%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1968 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; the:\nEast Africa.\n1968 marked the emergence of high altitude trained long distance runners from Kenya. While &lt;a href=\"Abebe%20Bikila\"&gt;Abebe Bikila&lt;/a&gt;'s victories in the two previous Olympic &lt;a href=\"Marathon\"&gt;Marathon&lt;/a&gt;s had announced to the world the potential of East African athletes, Kenya won its first Gold medals in Mexico City, and it won three of them, including the &lt;a href=\"Steeplechase%20%28athletics%29\"&gt;Steeplechase&lt;/a&gt; which it would subsequently claim ownership of. Kenya has won the steeplechase in every Olympics they have participated in since 1968. Ethiopia won its third straight marathon. There has been a fierce athletic rivalry between Kenya and Ethiopia ever since, while both countries and their neighbors have dominated long distance running both on the track and on the roads.\nFosbury Flop.\n&lt;a href=\"Dick%20Fosbury\"&gt;Dick Fosbury&lt;/a&gt; was the first to do what is now called the \"&lt;a href=\"Fosbury%20Flop\"&gt;Fosbury Flop&lt;/a&gt;\" to the High Jump. He learned to take advantage of the new foam landing pads (another technical innovation introduced in this era) by jumping over the bar backwards. Canadian &lt;a href=\"Debbie%20Brill\"&gt;Debbie Brill&lt;/a&gt; started doing the \"Brill Bend\" about the same time, but Fosbury got the most exposure, winning the Olympics. The prevailing methods involved jumping forwards or sideways, styles called the Roll or \"&lt;a href=\"Western%20Roll\"&gt;Western Roll&lt;/a&gt;\" and previous to that, the \"Scissors\" style. After Fosbury's victory, the flop became almost the only style used by elite competitors.\nPerformance enhancing drugs.\nThis was the first Olympics to do drug testing, though primarily these initial searches were for narcotics and stimulants."
