    "text": "Angers (, , ) is a city in western &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, about southwest of &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. It is the &lt;a href=\"Prefectures%20of%20France\"&gt;prefecture&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Maine-et-Loire\"&gt;Maine-et-Loire&lt;/a&gt; department and was the capital of the province of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. The inhabitants of both the city and the province are called \"Angevins\" or, more rarely, \"Angeriens\".\nAngers proper covers and has a population of 152,960 inhabitants, while around 422,700 live in its metropolitan area (\"aire urbaine\"). The &lt;a href=\"Communaut%C3%A9%20urbaine%20Angers%20Loire%20M%C3%A9tropole\"&gt;Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole&lt;/a&gt; is made up of 29 communes covering with 296,000 inhabitants (2017). Not including the broader metropolitan area, Angers is the third most populous &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20France\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; in northwestern France after &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rennes\"&gt;Rennes&lt;/a&gt; and the 18th most populous commune in France.\nFor centuries, Angers was an important stronghold in northwestern France. It was the cradle of the &lt;a href=\"Plantagenet\"&gt;Plantagenet&lt;/a&gt; dynasty and became one of the intellectual centers of Europe during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 of Anjou&lt;/a&gt;. Angers developed at the confluence of three rivers, the &lt;a href=\"Mayenne%20%28river%29\"&gt;Mayenne&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sarthe%20%28river%29\"&gt;Sarthe&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Loir\"&gt;Loir&lt;/a&gt;, all coming from the north and flowing south to the &lt;a href=\"Loire\"&gt;Loire&lt;/a&gt;. Their confluence, just north of Angers, creates the &lt;a href=\"Maine%20%28river%29\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;, a short but wide river that flows into the Loire several kilometres south.\nToday, Angers stands out for its specialization in the &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt; sector: V\u00e9g\u00e9polys is Europe's leading &lt;a href=\"Horticulture\"&gt;horticultural&lt;/a&gt; competitiveness cluster, and the city is also home to the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Community%20Plant%20Variety%20Office\"&gt;Community Plant Variety&lt;/a&gt; Office. In addition, the Angers metropolitan area is a major economic centre in western France, particularly active in industry and tourism. Angers enjoys a rich cultural life, made possible by its universities and museums. The old medieval center is still dominated by the massive &lt;a href=\"ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Angers\"&gt;ch\u00e2teau&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Plantagen%C3%AAt\"&gt;Plantagen\u00eat&lt;/a&gt;s, home of the \"&lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Tapestry\"&gt;Apocalypse Tapestry&lt;/a&gt;\", the biggest medieval tapestry ensemble in the world. Angers is also both at the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Val%20de%20Loire\"&gt;Val de Loire&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;, and the Loire-Anjou-Touraine &lt;a href=\"regional%20nature%20parks%20of%20France\"&gt;regional natural park&lt;/a&gt;.\nToponymy.\nEtymology.\nThe city is first mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy\"&gt;Ptolemy&lt;/a&gt; around AD\u00a0150 in his \"&lt;a href=\"Geography%20%28Ptolemy%29\"&gt;Geography&lt;/a&gt;\". It was then known as Juliomagus (, \"Iouliomagos\"), a name by which it also appears in the \"&lt;a href=\"Tabula%20Peutingeriana\"&gt;Tabula Peutingeriana&lt;/a&gt;\". The name is a compound of the Latin name &lt;a href=\"Julius\"&gt;Julius&lt;/a&gt; (probably in reference to &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Caesar\"&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Proto-Celtic\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; \"magos\", \"market\". Similar town dedications were common in &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Gaul\"&gt;Roman Gaul&lt;/a&gt;, and toponyms often kept a Gallic element. \nWhen the location needed to be distinguished from other Juliomagi, it was known as Juliomagus Andecavorum (\"Juliomagus of the &lt;a href=\"Andecavi\"&gt;Andecavi&lt;/a&gt;\"), in reference to the principal Gallic tribe in and around the city.\nAround AD\u00a0400, the city came to be referred to as the civitas Andecavorum (\"&lt;a href=\"civitas\"&gt;tribal capital&lt;/a&gt; of the Andecavi\"). This was a common change in Gaul, also seen in the names of &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tours\"&gt;Tours&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%89vreux\"&gt;\u00c9vreux&lt;/a&gt; around this time. During the Middle Ages, the late Latin name gradually developed into the modern one. It is successively mentioned as Andecava civitas (6th century), Andecavis (AD\u00a0769), Andegavis (861\u00a0\u00a0882), Angieus (in 1127) and Angeus (in 1205). The form Angiers appeared during the 12th century and was later corrupted to \"Angers\".\nThe Latin \"Andecavum\" gave also &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt; its name. This double formation is quite common in France and is also seen in \"&lt;a href=\"Poitiers\"&gt;Poitiers&lt;/a&gt;\" &amp; \"&lt;a href=\"Poitou\"&gt;Poitou&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Bourges\"&gt;Bourges&lt;/a&gt;\" &amp; \"&lt;a href=\"Berry%20%28province%29\"&gt;Berry&lt;/a&gt;\".\nNicknames.\nAngers was traditionally known as the \"Black City\" () because many roofs were built of &lt;a href=\"slate\"&gt;slate&lt;/a&gt;, due to the quarry in neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%A9laz%C3%A9\"&gt;Tr\u00e9laz\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. These have become less common since the development of the city in the 19th century.\nThe city has also been known as:\nHeraldry.\nThe coat of arms of Angers bears the French royal &lt;a href=\"fleur%20de%20lys\"&gt;fleur de lys&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;dukes of Anjou&lt;/a&gt; (the first duke was the son of the king of France, &lt;a href=\"John%20II%20of%20France\"&gt;Jean II&lt;/a&gt;); the key evokes the stronghold position of the city close to the &lt;a href=\"Brittany\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; border. An &lt;a href=\"acrostic\"&gt;acrostic&lt;/a&gt; from the Middle Ages calls it \"Antique clef de France\", which means \"Ancient key to France\":\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20I\"&gt;Napoleon I&lt;/a&gt;'s rule, Angers was one of the \"Bonnes villes\" and was therefore allowed to ask for a new coat of arms. The bees, symbol of the &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;First French Empire&lt;/a&gt;, then replaced the royal fleurs de lys.\nIn 1949, Angers received the &lt;a href=\"1939%E2%80%931945%20War%20Cross%20%28France%29\"&gt;1939\u20131945 War Cross&lt;/a&gt; and since then, the decoration is sometimes placed between the two fleurs de lys.\nAngers also had several mottos through its history:\nGeography.\nLocation.\nAngers in located at the geographical center of the &lt;a href=\"Maine-et-Loire\"&gt;Maine-et-Loire&lt;/a&gt; department, on the road which connects &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20ocean\"&gt;Atlantic ocean&lt;/a&gt;. The city is situated just south of the confluence of the &lt;a href=\"Loir\"&gt;Loir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mayenne%20%28river%29\"&gt;Mayenne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sarthe%20%28river%29\"&gt;Sarthe&lt;/a&gt; which form together the river &lt;a href=\"Maine%20%28river%29\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;. The Maine crosses Angers and heads south towards the &lt;a href=\"Loire\"&gt;Loire&lt;/a&gt;. The confluence of the three rivers and the proximity of the Loire make up a natural crossroads which favoured the foundation of the antique \"Juliomagus\".\nAngers is located from &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Rennes\"&gt;Rennes&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Poitiers\"&gt;Poitiers&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. It is also far from &lt;a href=\"Pornic\"&gt;Pornic&lt;/a&gt;, the closest sea resort, situated on the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20ocean\"&gt;Atlantic ocean&lt;/a&gt;.\nElevation varies &lt;a href=\"Above%20mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;above sea level&lt;/a&gt;. \nAngers is a hilly town, particularly marked by a rocky promontory dominating the lower valley of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;. This was the site of the ancient city and still houses the town's &lt;a href=\"ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Angers\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angers%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, and medieval quarters.\nAt the north and south, where the river &lt;a href=\"Maine%20%28river%29\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; arrives in and leaves Angers, the landscape is formed by islands, ponds and floodplains which are a haven for birds and a typical flora of the &lt;a href=\"Val%20de%20Loire\"&gt;Val de Loire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"%C3%A9tang%20Saint-Nicolas\"&gt;\u00e9tang Saint-Nicolas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lac%20de%20Maine\"&gt;Lac de Maine&lt;/a&gt;, both artificial, are among the biggest green areas of the city.\nMetropolitan area.\nThe commune of Angers is bordered by ten other &lt;a href=\"commune%20%28France%29\"&gt;communes&lt;/a&gt; which form various suburbs. These are, clockwise, &lt;a href=\"Avrill%C3%A9%2C%20Maine-et-Loire\"&gt;Avrill\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cantenay-%C3%89pinard\"&gt;Cantenay-\u00c9pinard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%89couflant\"&gt;\u00c9couflant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint-Barth%C3%A9lemy-d%27Anjou\"&gt;Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy-d'Anjou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%A9laz%C3%A9\"&gt;Tr\u00e9laz\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Les%20Ponts-de-C%C3%A9\"&gt;Les Ponts-de-C\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sainte-Gemmes-sur-Loire\"&gt;Sainte-Gemmes-sur-Loire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bouchemaine\"&gt;Bouchemaine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beaucouz%C3%A9\"&gt;Beaucouz\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. 22 other communes situated farther form with them the &lt;a href=\"Communaut%C3%A9%20urbaine%20Angers%20Loire%20M%C3%A9tropole\"&gt;Communaut\u00e9 urbaine Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole&lt;/a&gt;. All these peripheral communes are situated within from Angers proper. Together, they have around 272,400 inhabitants.\nClimate.\nAngers has an &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20climate\"&gt;oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt;, with moderate rain year-round. Winters have scarce frosts and snowfalls, and summers are warm and sunny.\nUrban morphology.\nThe oldest streets and buildings in Angers are located on the promontory where the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Angers\"&gt;Angers castle&lt;/a&gt; stands. The urban structure there dates back from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. \nA military presence there was attested from the 3rd century and some remains of an antique city wall are still visible on the castle grounds. This wall was built to protect the city from the Germanic invasions of AD\u00a0275 &amp; 276.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the castle was the core of the city's defence system, composed of tall city walls and river chains which prevented enemy ships from going up the Maine. The walls were last reconstructed between 1230 and 1240, by order of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20IX%20of%20France\"&gt;King Louis IX&lt;/a&gt;. Today, portions of the wall are still visible in Rue Toussaint and on Boulevard Carnot, as are some towers, like the \"Tour Villebon\" and the \"Tour des Anglais\".\nBefore the first &lt;a href=\"cadastre\"&gt;cadastre&lt;/a&gt; (1810), the city had not extended much beyond its medieval limits: on and around the castle promontory, with some dwellings on the other bank of the Maine in a neighbourhood called \"La Doutre\". That part of the city developed quickly during the industrial revolution and became a big river port. Industry was encouraged by firms like Bessonneau (textile factories) and &lt;a href=\"Cointreau\"&gt;Cointreau&lt;/a&gt; (distillery).\nAfter 1850, many suburbs appeared around the train stations and the slate quarries to the south in &lt;a href=\"Tr%C3%A9laz%C3%A9\"&gt;Tr\u00e9laz\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the port in La Doutre, demographic growth and urban extension were more significant on the eastern bank of the Maine, where the former Juliomagus had been founded.\nThe medieval city center was redeveloped and expanded from 1791. The \"Place du Ralliement\", the main square, was then built in place of three churches destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and, later, ring boulevards planted with trees replaced the city walls. \nThe architectural style used is mainly &lt;a href=\"Haussmann%27s%20renovation%20of%20Paris\"&gt;Haussmanian&lt;/a&gt;, but there are also some &lt;a href=\"Palladian%20architecture\"&gt;Palladian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Art%20Nouveau\"&gt;Art Nouveau&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Art%20Deco\"&gt;Art Deco&lt;/a&gt; buildings.\nAfter 1945 and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, several large &lt;a href=\"council%20estate\"&gt;council estate&lt;/a&gt;s made of tower blocks were built around the city center, the first of them being Belle-Beille in 1953. Industrial activity changed drastically: port activity declined while new factories, such as &lt;a href=\"Technicolor%20SA\"&gt;Technicolor SA&lt;/a&gt; in 1957, were built. During the 1970s, the collective approach to urban development gave way to more individual houses being built for the &lt;a href=\"middle%20class\"&gt;middle class&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the metropolitan area continued to grow, commuting became more common. New shopping areas were constructed close to the villages which had been subsumed into the city. Because of the floodplains that surround the city north and south, Angers can only grow significantly on an east\u2013west axis.\nGreen areas.\nBeing both at the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Val%20de%20Loire\"&gt;Val de Loire&lt;/a&gt; World Heritage site and on the largest river confluence in France, Angers has a high natural potential, notably highlighted by the Saint-Aubin island, situated north of the center and covering a tenth of the city total surface. Protected, the island is formed of swamps and natural meadows.\nThe oldest green areas date back from the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, when the moats of the castle were transformed into pleasure and kitchen gardens. Similar gardens were built by the aristocracy around their &lt;a href=\"h%C3%B4tel%20particulier\"&gt;h\u00f4tels particuliers&lt;/a&gt; and medicinal gardens were planted in hospices cloisters. The Jardin des plantes, the first &lt;a href=\"botanical%20garden\"&gt;botanical garden&lt;/a&gt;, dates back from the beginning of the 18th century. During the 19th century, others were built, for example the Faculty of Pharmacy garden and the Roseraie. The first recreational parks, for their part, were built during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20French%20Empire\"&gt;Second French Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"%C3%A9tang%20Saint-Nicolas\"&gt;\u00e9tang Saint-Nicolas&lt;/a&gt;, made by a sluice on a small river, the Brionneau, was protected as early as 1936.\nThe Jardin du Mail (\"Mall Garden\"), an esplanade situated outside the ring boulevards, was built between 1820 and 1880 on the former Champs de Mars (Fields of Mars, a place where the garrisons used to train and parade). Another esplanade, the Mail &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterrand\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand&lt;/a&gt;, was built in 1999 together with a garden inside the new Saint-Serge business district. During the 1960s the old gravel pits around the Maine were filled with water to form the Lac de Maine, which now hosts a marina. In 2010, a large amusement park, &lt;a href=\"Terra%20Botanica\"&gt;Terra Botanica&lt;/a&gt;, was inaugurated close to Saint-Aubin island.\nHistory.\nPrehistory and antiquity.\nThe first sign of human presence in Angers dates back to around 400,000\u00a0BC. Vestiges from the &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; are more abundant and include numerous polished stone axes. Burials from 4500\u00a0\u00a03500\u00a0BC were also discovered on the castle grounds.\nDuring the 5th century\u00a0BC, the &lt;a href=\"Andecavi\"&gt;Andecavi&lt;/a&gt;, a Celtic people, settled north of the &lt;a href=\"Loire\"&gt;Loire&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Iron\"&gt;Iron Age&lt;/a&gt;, Angers was a relatively densely populated &lt;a href=\"oppidum\"&gt;hillfort&lt;/a&gt;. While the settlement's Roman name\u2014Juliomagus\u2014may be older, it is only attested from the 3rd century. The Roman town consisted of many villas and baths and had an amphitheater as well as a &lt;a href=\"Mithraeum\"&gt;Mithraeum&lt;/a&gt;, a temple dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Mithra\"&gt;Mithra&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuccessive Germanic invasions in AD\u00a0275 and 276 forced the inhabitants to move to the highest point of their city and to build a wall around a small area of around .\nMiddle Ages.\nAngers received its first &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Angers\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; in 372 during the election of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20of%20Tours\"&gt;Martin of Tours&lt;/a&gt;. The first abbey, Saint-Aubin, was built during the 7th century to house the sarcophagus of &lt;a href=\"Albinus%20of%20Angers\"&gt;Saint Albinius&lt;/a&gt;. Saint-Serge Abbey was founded by the Merovingian kings &lt;a href=\"Clovis%20II\"&gt;Clovis II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theuderic%20III\"&gt;Theuderic III&lt;/a&gt; a century later. In 2008, ten Frankish sarcophagi from that period were discovered where Saint-Morille church once stood during the &lt;a href=\"Angers%20tramway\"&gt;tramway&lt;/a&gt; construction.\nFrom the 850s, Angers suffered from its situation on the border with &lt;a href=\"Brittany\"&gt;Brittany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Normandy\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt;. In September 851, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20the%20Bald\"&gt;Charles the Bald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Erispoe\"&gt;Erispoe&lt;/a&gt;, a Breton chief, met in the town to sign the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Jengland\"&gt;Treaty of Angers&lt;/a&gt;, which secured Breton independence and fixed the borders of &lt;a href=\"Brittany\"&gt;Brittany&lt;/a&gt;. However, the situation remained dangerous for Angers, and Charles the Bald created in 853 a wide buffer zone around Brittany comprising parts of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Touraine\"&gt;Touraine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maine%20%28province%29\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A9es\"&gt;S\u00e9es&lt;/a&gt;, which was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20the%20Strong\"&gt;Robert the Strong&lt;/a&gt;, a great-grandfather of &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Capet\"&gt;Hugh Capet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 870, the &lt;a href=\"Viking\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt; chief &lt;a href=\"Hastein\"&gt;Hastein&lt;/a&gt; seized Angers where he settled until a successful siege temporarily displaced him. He again took control of the town in 873, before the Carolingian Emperor ousted him.\n&lt;a href=\"Fulk%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Fulk I of Anjou&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Carolingian\"&gt;Carolingian&lt;/a&gt; descendant, was the first viscount of &lt;a href=\"Viscounty%20of%20Angers\"&gt;Angers&lt;/a&gt; (before 898 until 929) and of &lt;a href=\"Viscounty%20of%20Tours\"&gt;Tours&lt;/a&gt; (898\u2013909), and count of &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt; (909\u2013919). Around 929, he took the title of count (earl) of Angers and founded the first Anjou dynasty, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Ingelger\"&gt;House of Ingelger&lt;/a&gt; (\"French: Ingelgeriens\"). Angers subsequently formed the capital of the &lt;a href=\"French%20province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 12th century, after internal divisions in &lt;a href=\"Brittany\"&gt;Brittany&lt;/a&gt;, the county of Nantes was annexed by &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry II Plantagen\u00eat&lt;/a&gt; kept it for more than 30 years. The grandson of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry I of England&lt;/a&gt;, he also succeeded to the English crown and ruled the vast &lt;a href=\"Angevin%20Empire\"&gt;Angevin Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which stretched from the &lt;a href=\"Pyrenees\"&gt;Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Angers\"&gt;castle of Angers&lt;/a&gt; was then the seat of the Court and the dynasty. The Empire disappeared in 1204\u20131205 when the King of France, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip II&lt;/a&gt;, seized &lt;a href=\"Normandy\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;. Henceforth there were no more counts of &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;, as the French king had made Anjou a dukedom.\nNow a part of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20France\"&gt;Kingdom of France&lt;/a&gt;, Angers became the \"Key to the Kingdom\" () facing still independent &lt;a href=\"Brittany\"&gt;Brittany&lt;/a&gt;. In 1228, during &lt;a href=\"Louis%20IX%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis IX&lt;/a&gt;'s minority, &lt;a href=\"Blanche%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Blanche of Castile&lt;/a&gt; decided to fortify the city and to rebuild the castle. Later, during the 1350s and 1360s, the schools of Law, Medicine and Theology, renowned in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, were organized into a university. In 1373, &lt;a href=\"Louis%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Louis I of Naples and Anjou&lt;/a&gt; ordered the six tapestries illustrating the &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; of St John known today as the \"&lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Tapestry\"&gt;Apocalypse Tapestry&lt;/a&gt;\".\nRenaissance.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 of Anjou&lt;/a&gt; contributed to the economic revival in a city that had been diminished by the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Death\"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt; (1347\u20131350) and the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years War&lt;/a&gt; (1337\u20131453). A man of great culture and generosity, Ren\u00e9 transformed Angers into a cultural and political center and held court there. He transformed the castle moat into a &lt;a href=\"menagerie\"&gt;menagerie&lt;/a&gt; and built several gardens. He also founded in Angers a new &lt;a href=\"Ordre%20du%20Croissant\"&gt;Ordre du Croissant&lt;/a&gt; which was supposed to compete with the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Fleece\"&gt;Order of the Golden Fleece&lt;/a&gt;, created several years earlier.\nIn 1474, &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XI%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XI of France&lt;/a&gt;, in his attempt to conquer Anjou, came to Angers with his army, asking for the keys of the city. Ren\u00e9, then 65 years old, did not want to lead a war against his nephew and surrendered his domains without a fight. Thus, Anjou ceased to be an &lt;a href=\"appanage\"&gt;appanage&lt;/a&gt; and fell into the Royal domain. After his death, Ren\u00e9 was buried in 1480 in &lt;a href=\"Angers%20Cathedral\"&gt;Saint-Maurice cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1551, Angers became the seat of a &lt;a href=\"bailiwick\"&gt;bailiwick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"pr%C3%A9sidial\"&gt;pr\u00e9sidial&lt;/a&gt; of a jurisdiction, a position the city kept until 1790. At the same time, with the growth of &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestantism&lt;/a&gt; in France, a Catholic was placed at the head of the city and its castle while the &lt;a href=\"bourgeoisie\"&gt;bourgeoisie&lt;/a&gt; formed a Catholic militia to protect Angers from the &lt;a href=\"Huguenots\"&gt;Huguenots&lt;/a&gt;. The bishop, &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Bouvery\"&gt;Gabriel Bouvery&lt;/a&gt;, organized on his side an \"Angevin League\".\nWhen the news of the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Bartholomew%27s%20Day%20massacre\"&gt;St. Bartholomew's Day massacre&lt;/a&gt; reached Angers, another massacre took place in the city. The bodies of slain Protestants were thrown into the &lt;a href=\"Mayenne%20%28river%29\"&gt;Mayenne&lt;/a&gt;. It was the &lt;a href=\"aldermen\"&gt;aldermen&lt;/a&gt; who stopped the slaughter.\nIn 1598, the &lt;a href=\"Edict%20of%20Nantes\"&gt;Edict of Nantes&lt;/a&gt; was prepared by &lt;a href=\"Henri%20IV%20of%20France\"&gt;Henri IV&lt;/a&gt; in Angers. From 6 March until 2 April, Angers was the \"de facto\" capital of France and the King tried all means to satisfy the Catholics of the city, for example by laying the cornerstone of the new Capucine convent.\nClassical period.\nIn 1619, &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIII%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XIII of France&lt;/a&gt; gave the governance of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt; to his mother, &lt;a href=\"Marie%20de%27%20Medici\"&gt;Marie de' Medici&lt;/a&gt;. The Queen Mother settled in Angers, at the Logis Barrault, with her chaplain, &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Richelieu\"&gt;Cardinal Richelieu&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the premature death of Louis XIII in 1643, his son &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XIV&lt;/a&gt; was only an infant. France was troubled at this time by several famines and epidemics, and by political instability. In 1649, the people of Angers revolted against rising taxes, the start of the &lt;a href=\"Fronde\"&gt;Fronde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Fronde\"&gt;Fronde&lt;/a&gt; was a nationwide military conflict opposing some aristocrats wanting more autonomy and the Royal forces loyal to &lt;a href=\"Anne%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Anne of Austria&lt;/a&gt; as Queen Mother and Regent, and her prime minister, &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Mazarin\"&gt;Cardinal Mazarin&lt;/a&gt;. Royalist repression in Angers was narrowly averted by Bishop &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Arnauld\"&gt;Henri Arnauld&lt;/a&gt;, who interceded with the Queen Mother. Arnauld, who would remain Bishop of Angers until 1692, was to leave a deep mark on the religious life of the city during the second half of the 17th century.\nIn 1652, &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Chabot\"&gt;Henri Chabot&lt;/a&gt;, Duke of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Rohan\"&gt;Rohan&lt;/a&gt; and governor of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;, decided to back &lt;a href=\"Louis%2C%20Grand%20Cond%C3%A9\"&gt;Louis of Cond\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Fronde\"&gt;Fronde&lt;/a&gt;. Angers again became rebellious and &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XIV&lt;/a&gt; sent his army to seize it. The Duke of Rohan immediately surrendered and thus again prevented the sack of the city.\nFrench Revolution.\nThe first months of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt; were relatively quiet in Angers. In 1789, the city lost its ancient administrative positions, replaced in 1790 by the &lt;a href=\"department%20of%20France\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; of \"Mayenne-et-Loire\", soon renamed \"&lt;a href=\"Maine-et-Loire\"&gt;Maine-et-Loire&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;, as a political entity, disappeared, although the new department included most of its territory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20the%20Vend%C3%A9e\"&gt;War of Vend\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;, a Royalist rebellion and &lt;a href=\"counterrevolution\"&gt;counterrevolution&lt;/a&gt; led in &lt;a href=\"Vend%C3%A9e\"&gt;Vend\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;, a department located at the southwest of &lt;a href=\"Maine-et-Loire\"&gt;Maine-et-Loire&lt;/a&gt;, reached the &lt;a href=\"Loire\"&gt;Loire&lt;/a&gt; in March 1793. The Royalist army soon crossed the river and progressed as far as &lt;a href=\"Granville%2C%20Manche\"&gt;Granville&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Normandy\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt;, in November. Pushed back, the Vend\u00e9ens went back south and, to cross the Loire again, had to attack Angers.\nThe city was defended by 4,000 Republican soldiers, whereas the Royalists were at least 20,000, but weakened by successive fights and deceases. The &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Angers\"&gt;Siege of Angers&lt;/a&gt; occurred on 3 and 4 December 1793. The Royalists' bad tactics, as well as the strength of Angers city wall and castle, caused their loss. They consequently went back north for a while, around &lt;a href=\"Le%20Mans\"&gt;Le Mans&lt;/a&gt;, before crossing the &lt;a href=\"Loire\"&gt;Loire&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ancenis\"&gt;Ancenis&lt;/a&gt; on 16 December.\nIn 1794, fierce repression was conducted in the whole region against the Royalists. In Angers, 290 prisoners were shot and 1020 died of illness in jail. The city also welcomed many refugees, mostly Republicans living in Royalist rural areas. Between 19 and 31 May 1793, between 650 and 1000 Republican families sought asylum in Angers.\nSince 1800.\nDuring the 19th century, the city was deeply influenced by the urban transformations in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. The city traditionally had a somewhat sombre appearance from the quantity of local &lt;a href=\"slate\"&gt;slate&lt;/a&gt; used in construction but many quarters were gradually destroyed, redeveloped, or rebuilt on the Parisian model. The city wall, which formed a square around the old city core, was demolished around 1850 and replaced by wide boulevards. New districts of the city were also opened up on the opposite bank of the river.\nIn 1849, the Angers-&lt;a href=\"Saumur\"&gt;Saumur&lt;/a&gt; railway was built; it was extended to &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt; two years later. When completed, the line connected &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1850, a &lt;a href=\"catastrophic%20failure\"&gt;catastrophic failure&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Angers%20Bridge\"&gt;Basse-Cha\u00eene&lt;/a&gt; suspension bridge caused the deaths of over 200 soldiers. The disaster inhibited the construction of &lt;a href=\"suspension%20bridge\"&gt;suspension bridge&lt;/a&gt;s in France for two decades. The accident was mainly caused by soldiers' lilting march which created &lt;a href=\"resonance\"&gt;resonance&lt;/a&gt; in the bridge structure.\nIn 1875, a \"free faculty\" was created. It was soon assimilated to the medieval Angevin University (), which had been dissolved during the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. The new faculty was canonically erected as the Catholic University of Angers () by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20IX\"&gt;Pope Pius IX&lt;/a&gt; in 1879. However, in 1890, a law prohibited private institutions of higher education from calling themselves \"universities\". The institution was then renamed the \"Free Faculty of Angers\" (), although it kept its original name on an informal basis. At the beginning of the 20th century, two higher education establishments, specializing in agriculture and commercial sciences, were opened.\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, several &lt;a href=\"Art%20Nouveau\"&gt;Art Nouveau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Art%20Deco\"&gt;Art Deco&lt;/a&gt; buildings were constructed, such as the \"Nouvelles Galeries\", the \"Hotel des Postes\", \"Hotel Continental\", the \"Alcazar\" and the \"Maison bleue\".\nIn September 1939, when &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; was invaded by Germany, the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20government-in-exile\"&gt;Polish government-in-exile&lt;/a&gt; settled in Angers. It left the city on 12 June 1940, after the invasion of France by the &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt;. Angers fell to the &lt;a href=\"Nazi\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt;s during the same month. The Germans made it the seat of a regional Kommandantur. In 1941, a first &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; movement, called \"Honneur et Patrie\", was created in Angers. 60 Resistants were shot at the Belle-Beille range in 1942 and a German bunker factory employed 6000 people in 1943. In July 1942, 853 Jews were arrested and sent to &lt;a href=\"Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;Auschwitz&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the night of 28 May 1944, the first Allied bombing occurred over the Saint-Laud quarter. 243 people died and many others were wounded. Successive attacks on 29 and 30 May destroyed the train station and its surroundings which were reconstructed in the 1950s.\nAfter liberating &lt;a href=\"Avranches\"&gt;Avranches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rennes\"&gt;Rennes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Patton\"&gt;General Patton&lt;/a&gt; and his 5th infantry division arrived in &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt; on 5 August. To seize Angers, they decided to enter the city by its eastern side to surprise the Nazis. On 9 August, they crossed the Maine and started the fight. Helped by the local &lt;a href=\"French%20Forces%20of%20the%20Interior\"&gt;French Forces of the Interior&lt;/a&gt;, they progressively moved forward to the city center. The fight was nevertheless difficult and Angers was liberated the day after, at around 5 p.m.\nAfter the end of the war, the city experienced quick development and demographic growth. In 1971, a decision was made to reestablish a public university, and the Universit\u00e9 catholique d'Angers was split between the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20University%20of%20the%20West\"&gt;Universit\u00e9 catholique de l'Ouest&lt;/a&gt; (private) and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Angers\"&gt;Universit\u00e9 d'Angers&lt;/a&gt; (public). Angers continues to have two different universities.\nUntil the 1980s, Angers experienced several massive urban development plans, such as the construction of the Lac de Maine, and several vast council estates and shopping malls, as well as the construction of a highway which crossed the city through its center, a project that forced the destruction of many old buildings and destroyed the original quays on the Maine. Later, other urban plans were drawn up, with a new emphasis on nature and heritage protection, as well as on social mixing. During the 1990s, the redevelopment of the Saint-Serge quarter, located just north of the historical center, produced a new business center, gardens and university buildings.\nAdministration.\nAngers received its communal charter from &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XI%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XI of France&lt;/a&gt; in February 1475, but free elections for the &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20%28France%29\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aldermen\"&gt;aldermen&lt;/a&gt; were not guaranteed before 1484, following a decision by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VIII%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles VIII&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, 75 successive mayors have governed Angers.\nAngers was until the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; mainly governed by &lt;a href=\"centrism\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt; and republican mayors. From 1977 until 2014, all the successive mayors were been members of the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Party%20%28France%29\"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the &lt;a href=\"Maine-et-Loire\"&gt;Maine-et-Loire&lt;/a&gt; department has always been governed by moderate &lt;a href=\"right-wing\"&gt;right-wing&lt;/a&gt; parties. The current mayor is &lt;a href=\"Christophe%20B%C3%A9chu\"&gt;Christophe B\u00e9chu&lt;/a&gt;.\nAngers is divided into eight &lt;a href=\"canton%20%28France%29\"&gt;cantons&lt;/a&gt;; most of them include parts of Angers plus some surrounding communes. These cantons are not administrative entities and only serve to elect the members of the department council. The &lt;a href=\"INSEE\"&gt;INSEE&lt;/a&gt;, the French institute for statistics, divides the commune of Angers into twelve sectors. Depending on their social and economic issues, some of them can have priority for financial assistance and urban regeneration. In Angers, five are considered as priority sectors, three as sensitive urban areas, and one as an urban free zone.\nBeing the &lt;a href=\"chef-lieu\"&gt;chef-lieu&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Maine-et-Loire\"&gt;Maine-et-Loire&lt;/a&gt;, Angers is the seat of a &lt;a href=\"pr%C3%A9fectures%20in%20France\"&gt;prefecture&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the seat of a &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Appeal%20%28France%29\"&gt;Court of Appeal&lt;/a&gt; and of several regional or local institutes, concerning for example, customs, education or science. Angers also has several other courts of justice as well as a &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemographics.\nIn 2017, Angers had 152,960 inhabitants, 1.2% more than ten years before. It is the 18th most populated &lt;a href=\"commune%20%28France%29\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; in France. Censuses have been conducted since 1793.\nIn 2017, the urban area (\"unit\u00e9 urbaine\"), which encompasses Angers plus nine surrounding &lt;a href=\"commune%20%28France%29\"&gt;communes&lt;/a&gt; ( in total), had 228,550 inhabitants. The &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20area\"&gt;metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; (\"aire urbaine\") included in 2017 77 communes, 422,654 inhabitants and . The &lt;a href=\"Communaut%C3%A9%20urbaine%20Angers%20Loire%20M%C3%A9tropole\"&gt;Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole&lt;/a&gt;, an economic and political association of communes, includes 29 communes and around 296,000 inhabitants.\nThe population of Angers is relatively young, with 46% of the population being younger than 30 and 22% of residents over 60 years old. This is partially explained by the presence of two universities, 21.0% of the population between 15 and 64 being pupils and students in 2017.\nEconomy.\nThe early prosperity of the town was largely due to the nearby &lt;a href=\"quarry\"&gt;quarries&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"slate\"&gt;slate&lt;/a&gt;, whose abundant use for the roofs of Angers led to its sobriquet as the \"Black City\". In the mid-19th century, the principal manufactures were goods for &lt;a href=\"sailing%20ship\"&gt;sailing ship&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"sailcloth\"&gt;sailcloth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rope\"&gt;rope&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"linen\"&gt;linen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hosiery\"&gt;hose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wax\"&gt;wax&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;, as well as agricultural products (mainly &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wine\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt;). By the time of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cointreau\"&gt;Cointreau&lt;/a&gt; had developed the distillation of &lt;a href=\"liqueur\"&gt;liqueur&lt;/a&gt;s from the area's fruit to an industrial level. The work for sailing ships was still carried on but &lt;a href=\"steamship\"&gt;steamship&lt;/a&gt;s had greatly reduced demand. Instead, local companies produced &lt;a href=\"Electrical%20cable\"&gt;cable&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wire\"&gt;wire&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"thread%20%28yarn%29\"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; and increased production of &lt;a href=\"footwear\"&gt;footwear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"umbrella\"&gt;umbrella&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"parasol\"&gt;parasol&lt;/a&gt;s. The area's vineyards focused on &lt;a href=\"sparkling%20wine\"&gt;sparkling wine&lt;/a&gt; and fruit was increasingly &lt;a href=\"preserved%20fruit\"&gt;preserved&lt;/a&gt; for sale elsewhere. The area had also developed a small-scale &lt;a href=\"textile%20industry\"&gt;textile industry&lt;/a&gt; and begun producing machines, as well as commercial-scale production of &lt;a href=\"hemp\"&gt;hemp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPresent-day Angers provides 45.7% of the &lt;a href=\"Maine-et-Loire\"&gt;Maine-et-Loire&lt;/a&gt; job positions. It is the 22nd-largest national job provider and the 3rd-largest one in northwestern France after &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rennes\"&gt;Rennes&lt;/a&gt;. Its unemployment rate (13.5% in 2017) is above the national rate. 20.7% of the people working in Angers have graduate or post-graduate qualifications.\n&lt;a href=\"Cointreau\"&gt;Cointreau&lt;/a&gt; continues to produce its orange triple-sec liqueur in nearby &lt;a href=\"Saint-Barth%C3%A9lemy-d%27Anjou\"&gt;Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy-d'Anjou&lt;/a&gt;, but many of the other industries have since vanished. Modern Angers produces &lt;a href=\"Scania%20%28company%29\"&gt;Scania&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"truck\"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Ecouflant\"&gt;Ecouflant&lt;/a&gt; and computers by &lt;a href=\"Groupe%20Bull\"&gt;Bull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Packard%20Bell\"&gt;Packard Bell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"NEC\"&gt;NEC&lt;/a&gt;. It also supports research labs investigating horticulture and biotechnology. Thanks to its several higher education schools, laboratories, and various offices, Angers is the largest horticultural center in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and, as the home of the &lt;a href=\"Community%20Plant%20Variety%20Office\"&gt;Community Plant Variety Office&lt;/a&gt;, Angers is the hub of the &lt;a href=\"plant%20breeders%27%20rights\"&gt;plant breeders' rights&lt;/a&gt; system in the &lt;a href=\"European%20Community\"&gt;European Community&lt;/a&gt;. For example, Angers is the leading hydrangeas producer in Europe. The local economy also relies on the presence of many administrative, educational, and health institutions. There are also many small firms, chiefly focused on the agricultural tradition of &lt;a href=\"Maine-et-Loire\"&gt;Maine-et-Loire&lt;/a&gt;. Angers also serves as a regional financial center, with many banks and insurance companies (including &lt;a href=\"Afone\"&gt;Afone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"CNP%20Assurances\"&gt;CNP Assurances&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cr%C3%A9dit%20Agricole\"&gt;Cr\u00e9dit Agricole&lt;/a&gt;, Fiducial, and &lt;a href=\"Groupama\"&gt;Groupama&lt;/a&gt;) maintaining their regional offices there.\nAngers is an important convention center, with a present convention trade of around \u20ac8,000,000. The new convention center slated for 2016 has been cancelled in 2013. The renovation of the previous convention center and the addition of a 400 conference room at the back by the garden should be finished in 2018. The \"Parc des Expositions\", where fairs are currently held, welcomes 600,000 visitors and more than 300 events each year. With its , it is the biggest structure of its type in northwestern France.\nHealth and education.\nThe \"H\u00f4tel-Dieu\", founded in the 12th century, is one of the oldest hospitals in France. First located in the \"Hospice Saint-Jean\", it moved into new buildings in 1870; it became &lt;a href=\"Teaching%20Hospital\"&gt;Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU)&lt;/a&gt; in 1966. It has 1,500 beds and around 5,500 people work there. Two private hospitals and a regional center for re-education also exist.\nA center of learning, Angers boasts two renowned universities and several specialized institutions, altogether enrolling more than 26,000 students. The &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20University%20of%20the%20West\"&gt;Catholic University of the West&lt;/a&gt; ( or UCO) is one of five Catholic universities in France. UCO is best known for its International Center for the Study of the French Language ( or CIDEF), which provides college students from around the world with college-level course instruction in the French language, and for its Institute for the Development of Consulting and Business ( or &lt;a href=\"IDCE\"&gt;IDCE&lt;/a&gt;), an important &lt;a href=\"business%20school\"&gt;business school&lt;/a&gt; which offers undergraduate and graduate (MBA) degrees in International Business and Consulting. The town is also home to a state university, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Angers\"&gt;University of Angers&lt;/a&gt;, best university in France in 2015 for success rates.\nAngers is also home to engineering graduate schools, such as the &lt;a href=\"Arts%20et%20M%C3%A9tiers%20ParisTech\"&gt;Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech&lt;/a&gt;, top school in mechanical and industrial engineering and the ESEO, an engineering school in electronics and computer science. Its education and &lt;a href=\"research%20institute\"&gt;research institute&lt;/a&gt;s are the driving force behind the city's science and technology industries.\nAngers's other educational institutions include lyc\u00e9es, training colleges and a school of &lt;a href=\"fine%20art\"&gt;fine art&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother Angers's Business School is &lt;a href=\"ESSCA\"&gt;ESSCA&lt;/a&gt; (). Formerly part of the UCO, the school's Master's program is of a duration of five years. ESSCA recruits students after the &lt;a href=\"Baccalaureat\"&gt;Baccalaureat&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to French schools and universities, an American university, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Edward%27s%20University\"&gt;St. Edward's University&lt;/a&gt;, has a new expanding campus in Angers. St. Edward's University is a diverse, Catholic liberal arts institution from &lt;a href=\"Austin%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The university has a partnership with UCO, and offers a variety of courses of undergraduate level and professional training.\nTransport.\nAngers is situated on the crossroads of three highways, the &lt;a href=\"A11%20autoroute\"&gt;A11&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Autoroute%20A87\"&gt;A87&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"La%20Roche-sur-Yon\"&gt;La Roche-sur-Yon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Autoroute%20A85\"&gt;A85&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tours\"&gt;Tours&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt;. National roads connect the city with &lt;a href=\"Rennes\"&gt;Rennes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caen\"&gt;Caen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Laval%2C%20Mayenne\"&gt;Laval&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the construction of bypasses during the 2000s, the A11 crossed the city center, following the river Maine, and passed just below the castle. Causing air pollution and noise and disfiguring the Maine quays, the portions of the former highway which are still in place should be redeveloped in the coming years.\nAngers inaugurated the new Irigo &lt;a href=\"tram\"&gt;tram&lt;/a&gt; system on 25 June 2011. The tramway consists of one line with 25 stops. The line runs from Avrill\u00e9-Ardenne in the north to Angers-Roseraie in the south, passing by the center and the train station. Service is provided by Keolis using 17 &lt;a href=\"Alstom%20Citadis\"&gt;Alstom Citadis&lt;/a&gt; trams. The system uses partial &lt;a href=\"ground-level%20power%20supply\"&gt;ground-level power supply&lt;/a&gt;, which avoids aerial wires and preserves the historical character of the city center. A second line is scheduled for 2018\u20132022. Besides the tram, Irigo also organizes the bus network in Angers consisting of 13 urban lines and 12 suburban lines.\nThe bus station, situated outside the &lt;a href=\"Gare%20d%27Angers-Saint-Laud\"&gt;Angers Saint-Laud&lt;/a&gt; train station, is a hub for the departmental bus network (\"Anjoubus\") and is also served by international bus companies.\nAngers is on both the &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; railways. The city has several train stations, all originally built in the 19th century. Some are still in use; others are closed or reserved for freight. The main station, &lt;a href=\"Gare%20d%27Angers-Saint-Laud\"&gt;Angers Saint-Laud&lt;/a&gt;, is on a &lt;a href=\"TGV\"&gt;TGV&lt;/a&gt; line and has direct &lt;a href=\"TGV\"&gt;TGV&lt;/a&gt; services to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; (1 hour 30 minutes), &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; (3 hours 45 minutes), &lt;a href=\"Strasbourg\"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt; (4 hours 35 minutes), and &lt;a href=\"Lille\"&gt;Lille&lt;/a&gt; (3 hours 25 minutes), as well as &lt;a href=\"Avignon\"&gt;Avignon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marseilles\"&gt;Marseilles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Montpellier\"&gt;Montpellier&lt;/a&gt;. Regional trains go to &lt;a href=\"Cholet\"&gt;Cholet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saumur\"&gt;Saumur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tours\"&gt;Tours&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blois\"&gt;Blois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nevers\"&gt;Nevers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bourges\"&gt;Bourges&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe nearest airport is &lt;a href=\"Angers%20-%20Loire%20Airport\"&gt;Angers - Loire Airport&lt;/a&gt;, which replaced in 1998 an older airport near the Saint-Aubin island. The airport is located in the commune of &lt;a href=\"Marc%C3%A9\"&gt;Marc\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, from Angers and close to the A11 and the A85. It can receive 50,000 passengers per year.\nCulture.\nMain sights.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Angers\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau d'Angers&lt;/a&gt;, built on a &lt;a href=\"schist\"&gt;schist&lt;/a&gt; promontory, dominates the river &lt;a href=\"Maine%20%28river%29\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; and the old town. Its site has been occupied since antiquity; the castle itself was built between 1230 and 1240 by &lt;a href=\"Louis%20IX%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis IX of France&lt;/a&gt;. The massive walls are about one kilometer long and punctuated by 17 towers; they were built with horizontal slices of &lt;a href=\"tuff\"&gt;tuff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"schist\"&gt;schist&lt;/a&gt;, giving it strength and an original striped look. During the 15th century, a chapel and the Ch\u00e2telet were added in the courtyard.\nThe \"\" (\"Adam's House\"), located behind the cathedral, is an excellent example of the half-timbered houses which were built during the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;. Many similar houses, although smaller, are also visible along the streets around the castle. The city also displays several &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"classical%20architecture\"&gt;classical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"h%C3%B4tel%20particulier\"&gt;h\u00f4tels particuliers&lt;/a&gt;, the most renowned being the \"Logis Pinc\u00e9\" from the 16th century. The \"Maison bleue\" (\"Blue House\"), built in 1927, is an &lt;a href=\"Art%20Deco\"&gt;Art Deco&lt;/a&gt; masterpiece. The former seat of the French Aviation Company () was built in 1938 and abandoned during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;. Totally refurbished in 2004, it is now a testimony to 1930s architecture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Angers%20Cathedral\"&gt;Saint-Maurice cathedral&lt;/a&gt; is a major landmark in the cityscape, with its two spires culminating at . The construction of the current building started during the 12th century on the remains of an older sanctuary. The original structure, &lt;a href=\"romanesque%20architecture\"&gt;romanesque&lt;/a&gt;, received gothic columns and vaults in the middle of the 12th century, giving birth to the Angevin &lt;a href=\"gothic%20architecture\"&gt;gothic&lt;/a&gt;, a style that quickly spread in Western France and the Angevin possessions in &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. Sculptures and architectural details were added to the fa\u00e7ade during the 16th century. The twin spires were built in 1518 and 1523. The neighbouring \"Palais du Tau\", the former episcopal palace, dates from the 12th century.\nThe skyline is also marked by the \"Tour Saint-Aubin\". Completed in 1170, it was the bell-tower of an abbey closed during the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed in 1810. Elaborately sculptured 11th and 12th century arcades also survive in the courtyard of the Prefecture. Another abbey, the \"Abbaye Toussaint\", founded during the 13th century, was also partially pulled down and only the church and parts of the cloister are still visible. On the southern limits of the commune, close to the Maine, stands the \"Couvent de la Baumette\", founded during the 15th century by &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 of Anjou&lt;/a&gt;.\nLa Doutre, an old quarter located on the western bank of the Maine and facing the castle, contains two major medieval sites, the former \"Abbaye du Ronceray\", built during the 11th and 12th century, and the \"H\u00f4pital Saint-Jean\", founded by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry II of England&lt;/a&gt; and used as the city hospital until 1870.\nMuseums.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mus%C3%A9e%20des%20Beaux-Arts%20d%27Angers\"&gt;Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts d'Angers&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; \"Logis Barrault\", displays a collection of paintings and sculptures dating from the 14th century to today. It is particularly renowned for its 18th-century paintings, including works by &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Greuze\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Greuze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Van%20Loo\"&gt;Van Loo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antoine%20Watteau\"&gt;Antoine Watteau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jean-Honor%C3%A9%20Fragonard\"&gt;Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Sim%C3%A9on%20Chardin\"&gt;Jean Sim\u00e9on Chardin&lt;/a&gt;. The museum also contains a graphic design studio, a gallery devoted to the history of Angers and a temporary exhibition gallery. The institution has an annexe at the ch\u00e2teau in &lt;a href=\"Villev%C3%AAque\"&gt;Villev\u00eaque&lt;/a&gt;, a village located several kilometers north of the city.\nInside the &lt;a href=\"ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Angers\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;, a special gallery displays the &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Tapestry\"&gt;Apocalypse Tapestry&lt;/a&gt;, ordered by &lt;a href=\"Louis%20I%20of%20Naples\"&gt;Louis I of Naples&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 14th century. It is more than long, the largest medieval tapestry in the world. Inspired by &lt;a href=\"miniature%20%28illuminated%20manuscript%29\"&gt;manuscript miniatures&lt;/a&gt;, the successive scenes, designed by &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Bondol\"&gt;Jean Bondol&lt;/a&gt;, illustrate the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Revelation\"&gt;Apocalypse of St John&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocated inside the old \"H\u00f4pital Saint-Jean\", the \"Mus\u00e9e Jean-Lur\u00e7at et de la tapisserie contemporaine\" displays tapestries dating from the 19th and 20th centuries. The museum is dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Lur%C3%A7at\"&gt;Jean Lur\u00e7at&lt;/a&gt;, an artist noted for his role in the revival of contemporary tapestry, and notably exhibits his \"Chant du Monde\", a modern echo to the \"&lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20Tapestry\"&gt;Apocalypse Tapestry&lt;/a&gt;\" made after the bombing of &lt;a href=\"Hiroshima\"&gt;Hiroshima&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mus%C3%A9um%20d%27histoire%20naturelle%20d%27Angers\"&gt;Mus\u00e9um d'histoire naturelle d'Angers&lt;/a&gt; has been located in the 1521 H\u00f4tel Demarie-Valentin since 1885. It exhibits a large collection of mounted animals and fossils, divided in three departments, one for &lt;a href=\"zoology\"&gt;zoology&lt;/a&gt;, one for &lt;a href=\"botany\"&gt;botany&lt;/a&gt; and the last one for &lt;a href=\"paleontology\"&gt;paleontology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"geology\"&gt;geology&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Logis Pinc\u00e9\", constructed during the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, is the home of the museum of the same name. It displays Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities as well as Chinese and Japanese artifacts.\nLocated in the \"Abbaye Toussaint\", the \"Galerie David d'Angers\" gathers sculptures, reliefs, and medallions by &lt;a href=\"David%20d%27Angers\"&gt;David d'Angers&lt;/a&gt;, a 19th-century sculptor born in the city. The gallery also owns the preparatory works for the &lt;a href=\"Panth%C3%A9on%2C%20Paris\"&gt;Panth\u00e9on of Paris&lt;/a&gt; pediment.\nAngers also enjoys a \"Maison de l'Architecture\", which organizes various exhibitions and workshops, as well as several temporary exhibition galleries distributed in the city center. Outside the commune limits are also an aviation museum and a museum of communications.\nEntertainment and performing arts.\nThe \"Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\", dominating the Place du Ralliement, was first built in 1791, but destroyed by a fire in 1853. The existing building was completed in 1871 and its auditorium contains six stalls and four balconies, totaling 730 seats. The \"Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Quai\", inaugurated in 2007, has two auditoriums; one contains 980 seats and several balconies, and the other, more flexible, can welcome 400 seated or 960 standing spectators. The Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Quai are the venues of three institutions, \"&lt;a href=\"Angers-Nantes%20Op%C3%A9ra\"&gt;Angers-Nantes Op\u00e9ra&lt;/a&gt;\", an opera company also based in &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt;, the Contemporary Dance National Center (CNDC), inaugurated by &lt;a href=\"Alwin%20Nikolais\"&gt;Alwin Nikolais&lt;/a&gt; in 1978, and the \"Nouveau th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Angers\" (NTA).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Orchestre%20National%20des%20Pays%20de%20la%20Loire\"&gt;Orchestre National des Pays de la Loire&lt;/a&gt;, shared with &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt;, usually performs at the Congress Center, built in 1983, with a capacity of 1,240 seats. Other concert halls include the \"Chabada\", the \"Amphit\u00e9a\" and the former Ursuline chapel. Local theater companies perform at \"Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Chanzy\", \"Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Champ de Bataille\", \"Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Com\u00e9die\" or at the \"Centre Jean Vilar\". Each September, the city organizes a street performance festival, called the \"Accroche-C\u0153urs\".\nThe \"Chabada\", a popular concert hall, is the cradle of the Angevin contemporary scene and several groups and performers were discovered there, &lt;a href=\"Les%20Thugs\"&gt;Les Thugs&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"punk%20rock\"&gt;punk&lt;/a&gt; band formed in 1983, being the first ones. The local scene also includes the &lt;a href=\"alternative%20rock\"&gt;alternative rock&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"La%20Ruda\"&gt;La Ruda&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"power%20pop\"&gt;power pop&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Pony%20Pony%20Run%20Run\"&gt;Pony Pony Run Run&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"world%20music\"&gt;world music&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Lo%27Jo\"&gt;Lo'Jo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Titi%20Robin\"&gt;Titi Robin&lt;/a&gt;, a performer influenced by &lt;a href=\"Gypsy%20style\"&gt;Gypsy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20music\"&gt;Arabic music&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Premiers Plans festival, dedicated to European first films and meant to help new directors meet their audience, is conducted every year and lasts one week. The films are screened in three small cinemas, while two big &lt;a href=\"generalist%20channel\"&gt;generalist multiplexes&lt;/a&gt; also exist in Angers.\nMedia.\nAngers had a local TV channel \"Angers 7\" which went bankrupt in 2010 and was replaced 3 years later by \"Angers T\u00e9l\u00e9\". The national French channel &lt;a href=\"France%203\"&gt;France 3&lt;/a&gt;, however, still presents local news in its programs.
