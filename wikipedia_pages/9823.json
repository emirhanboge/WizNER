    "text": "Eris (; ', \"Strife\") is the &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Greek%20religion\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goddess\"&gt;goddess&lt;/a&gt; of strife and discord. Her Roman equivalent is Discordia, which means the same. Eris's Greek opposite is &lt;a href=\"Harmonia%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Harmonia&lt;/a&gt;, whose Roman counterpart is &lt;a href=\"Concordia%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Concordia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Homer\"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt; equated her with the war-goddess &lt;a href=\"Enyo\"&gt;Enyo&lt;/a&gt;, whose Roman counterpart is &lt;a href=\"Bellona%20%28goddess%29\"&gt;Bellona&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"dwarf%20planet\"&gt;dwarf planet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eris%20%28dwarf%20planet%29\"&gt;Eris&lt;/a&gt; is named after the goddess.\nShe had no temples in ancient Greece and functions essentially as a &lt;a href=\"personification\"&gt;personification&lt;/a&gt;, as which she appears in &lt;a href=\"Homer\"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt; and many later works.\nEtymology.\n\"Eris\" is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb , 'to raise, stir, excite', and the proper name have been suggested. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20S.%20P.%20Beekes\"&gt;R. S. P. Beekes&lt;/a&gt; rejects these derivations and suggested a &lt;a href=\"Pre-Greek\"&gt;Pre-Greek&lt;/a&gt; origin.\nCharacteristics in Greek mythology.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hesiod\"&gt;Hesiod&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Works%20and%20Days\"&gt;Works and Days&lt;/a&gt;\" 11\u201324, two different goddesses named Eris are distinguished:\n&lt;poem&gt;So, after all, there was not one kind of Strife alone, but all over the earth there are two. As for the one, a man would praise her when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle, being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the deathless gods, men pay harsh Strife her honour due.\n(&lt;a href=\"Nyx%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Nyx&lt;/a&gt;), and the son of Cronus [i.e. &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;] who sits above and dwells in the &lt;a href=\"Aether%20%28classical%20element%29\"&gt;aether&lt;/a&gt;, set her in the roots of the earth: and she is far kinder to men. She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This Strife is wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and craftsman with craftsman and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel of minstrel.&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn Hesiod's \"&lt;a href=\"Theogony\"&gt;Theogony&lt;/a&gt;\" (226\u2013232), Eris, the daughter of Night, is less kindly spoken of as she brings forth other personifications as her children:\nAnd hateful Eris bore painful &lt;a href=\"Ponos\"&gt;Ponos&lt;/a&gt; (\"Hardship\"),\n&lt;a href=\"Lethe\"&gt;Lethe&lt;/a&gt; (\"Forgetfulness\") and &lt;a href=\"Limos%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Limos&lt;/a&gt; (\"Starvation\") and the tearful &lt;a href=\"Algos\"&gt;Algea&lt;/a&gt; (\"Pains\"),\n&lt;a href=\"Hysminai\"&gt;Hysminai&lt;/a&gt; (\"Battles\"), &lt;a href=\"Makhai\"&gt;Makhai&lt;/a&gt; (\"Wars\"), &lt;a href=\"Phonoi\"&gt;Phonoi&lt;/a&gt; (\"Murders\"), and &lt;a href=\"Androctasiai\"&gt;Androktasiai&lt;/a&gt; (\"Manslaughters\");\n&lt;a href=\"Neikea\"&gt;Neikea&lt;/a&gt; (\"Quarrels\"), Pseudea (\"Lies\"), Logoi (\"Stories\"), &lt;a href=\"Amphillogiai\"&gt;Amphillogiai&lt;/a&gt; (\"Disputes\")\n&lt;a href=\"Dysnomia%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Dysnomia&lt;/a&gt; (\"Anarchy\") and &lt;a href=\"At%C3%AB\"&gt;Ate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ruin\"), near one another,\nand &lt;a href=\"Horkos\"&gt;Horkos&lt;/a&gt; (\"Oath\"), who most afflicts men on earth,\nThen willing swears a false oath.\nThe other Eris is presumably she who appears in &lt;a href=\"Homer\"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Iliad\"&gt;Iliad&lt;/a&gt;\" Book\u00a0IV; equated with &lt;a href=\"Enyo\"&gt;Enyo&lt;/a&gt; as sister of &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt; and so presumably daughter of &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;:\n... and Discord [\"\u1f1c\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2\"] that rageth incessantly, sister and comrade of man-slaying Ares; she at the first rears her crest but little, yet thereafter planteth her head in heaven, while her feet tread on earth. She it was that now cast evil strife into their midst as she fared through the throng, making the groanings of men to wax.\nShe also has &lt;a href=\"Enyalius\"&gt;a son whom she named Strife&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnyo is mentioned in Book 5, and Zeus sends Strife to rouse the &lt;a href=\"Achaeans%20%28Homer%29\"&gt;Achaeans&lt;/a&gt; in Book 11, of the same work.\nThe most famous tale of Eris recounts her initiating the &lt;a href=\"Trojan%20War\"&gt;Trojan War&lt;/a&gt; by causing the &lt;a href=\"Judgement%20of%20Paris\"&gt;Judgement of Paris&lt;/a&gt;. The goddesses &lt;a href=\"Hera\"&gt;Hera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; had been invited along with the rest of &lt;a href=\"Twelve%20Olympians\"&gt;Olympus&lt;/a&gt; to the forced wedding of &lt;a href=\"Peleus\"&gt;Peleus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thetis\"&gt;Thetis&lt;/a&gt;, who would become the parents of &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;, but Eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations.\nShe therefore (as mentioned at the \"&lt;a href=\"Cypria\"&gt;Kypria&lt;/a&gt;\" according to Proclus as part of a plan hatched by Zeus and &lt;a href=\"Themis\"&gt;Themis&lt;/a&gt;) tossed into the party the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20of%20Discord\"&gt;Apple of Discord&lt;/a&gt;, a golden &lt;a href=\"apple%20%28symbolism%29\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt; inscribed \u00a0\u2013 \"For the most beautiful one\", or \"To the Fairest One\"\u00a0\u2013 provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient. The hapless &lt;a href=\"Paris%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of &lt;a href=\"Troy\"&gt;Troy&lt;/a&gt;, was appointed to select the fairest by Zeus. The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris's decision, and also attempted to bribe him. Hera offered political power; &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; promised infinite wisdom; and &lt;a href=\"Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: &lt;a href=\"Helen%20of%20Troy\"&gt;Helen&lt;/a&gt;, wife of &lt;a href=\"Menelaus\"&gt;Menelaus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sparta\"&gt;Sparta&lt;/a&gt;. While Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, &lt;a href=\"Paris%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued.\nEris is also mentioned in &lt;a href=\"Nonnus\"&gt;Nonnus&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Dionysiaca\", when &lt;a href=\"Typhon\"&gt;Typhon&lt;/a&gt; prepares to battle with Zeus:\nEris (\"Strife\") was Typhon's escort in the mellay, &lt;a href=\"Nike%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt; (\"Victory\") led Zeus into battle.\nAnother story of Eris includes Hera, and the love of Polytekhnos and &lt;a href=\"Aedon\"&gt;Aedon&lt;/a&gt;. They claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus were in love. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to wreak discord upon them. Polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board, and Aedon a web she had been weaving. Eris said to them, \"Whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant!\" Aedon won. But Polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat, so he came to Khelidon, Aedon's sister, and raped her. He then disguised her as a slave, presenting her to Aedon. When Aedon discovered this was indeed her sister, she chopped up Polytekhnos's son and fed him to Polytekhnos. The gods were not pleased, so they turned them all into birds.\nCultural influences.\nDiscordianism.\nEris has been adopted as the patron deity of the modern &lt;a href=\"Discordianism\"&gt;Discordian&lt;/a&gt; religion, which was begun in the late 1950s by &lt;a href=\"Malaclypse%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Gregory Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kerry%20Wendell%20Thornley\"&gt;Kerry Wendell Thornley&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"pen%20name\"&gt;pen name&lt;/a&gt;s of \"Malaclypse the Younger\" and \"Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst\". The Discordian version of Eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent Graeco-Roman original, wherein she is depicted as a positive (albeit mischievous) force of chaotic creation. \"&lt;a href=\"Principia%20Discordia\"&gt;Principia Discordia&lt;/a&gt;\", the first holy book of Discordianism, states:\nThe story of Eris being snubbed and indirectly starting the Trojan War is recorded in the \"Principia\", and is referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Discordianism%23The%20%26quot%3Boriginal%20snub%26quot%3B\"&gt;Original Snub&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Principia Discordia\" states that her parents may be as described in Greek legend, or that she may be the daughter of Void. She is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, whereas her sister &lt;a href=\"Aneris\"&gt;Aneris&lt;/a&gt; (called the equivalent of &lt;a href=\"Harmonia%20%28Greek%20goddess%29\"&gt;Harmonia&lt;/a&gt; by the Mythics of Harmonia) is the goddess of Order and Non-Being. Their brother is Spirituality.\nDiscordian Eris is looked upon as a foil to the preoccupation of western philosophy in attempting find order in the chaos of reality, in prescribing order to be synonymous with truth. Discordian Eris teaches us that the only truth is chaos, and that order and disorder are simply temporary filters applied to the lenses we view the chaos through. This is known as the Aneristic Illusion.\nIn this telling, Eris becomes something of a patron saint of chaotic creation:\nThe concept of Eris as developed by the \"Principia Discordia\" is used and expanded upon in the &lt;a href=\"science%20fiction\"&gt;science fiction&lt;/a&gt; work \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Illuminatus%21%20Trilogy\"&gt;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Shea\"&gt;Robert Shea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Anton%20Wilson\"&gt;Robert Anton Wilson&lt;/a&gt; (in which characters from \"Principia Discordia\" appear). In this work, Eris is a major character.\nOther.\nThe classic &lt;a href=\"fairy%20tale\"&gt;fairy tale&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Beauty\"&gt;Sleeping Beauty&lt;/a&gt;\" is partly inspired by Eris's role in the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Peleus\"&gt;Peleus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thetis\"&gt;Thetis&lt;/a&gt;. Like Eris, a malevolent &lt;a href=\"fairy\"&gt;fairy&lt;/a&gt; curses a princess after not being invited to the princess's &lt;a href=\"infant%20baptism\"&gt;christening&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe New Zealand moth species \"&lt;a href=\"Ichneutica%20eris\"&gt;Ichneutica eris&lt;/a&gt;\" was named in honour of Eris."
