However, Grace was unable to break into Munster's senior squad, and he moved to England to join &lt;a href=\"Premiership%20Rugby\"&gt;Premiership Rugby&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20Chiefs\"&gt;Exeter Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the 2010\u201311 season. Grace's time with the Devon club was hampered by an achilles injury, and after one season with Exeter, Grace returned to Ireland to join &lt;a href=\"Connacht%20Rugby\"&gt;Connacht&lt;/a&gt;. He stayed with the western province for two seasons, which were also hampered by injury, before returning to &lt;a href=\"Devon\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; to join &lt;a href=\"Plymouth%20Albion%20R.F.C.\"&gt;Plymouth Albion&lt;/a&gt;, where he lodged with fellow former Munsterman &lt;a href=\"Declan%20Cusack\"&gt;Declan Cusack&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter two seasons with Plymouth, Grace joined another &lt;a href=\"RFU%20Championship\"&gt;RFU Championship&lt;/a&gt; side, &lt;a href=\"Ealing%20Trailfinders%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;Ealing Trailfinders&lt;/a&gt;, for the 2015\u201316 season. At the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season, Grace signed for &lt;a href=\"Coventry%20R.F.C.\"&gt;Coventry&lt;/a&gt; and was appointed co-captain of the club, before ending his career back with Plymouth, whilst also coaching in the club's academy and community programme. After rugby, Grace began running two companies; \"Eolas+\", a not-for-profit that goes into primary schools and runs holiday camps in the south-west of England to get children involved in sports, and \"Pro Rugby Academy\", which works with aspiring rugby players who have missed out on contracts with professional clubs."
