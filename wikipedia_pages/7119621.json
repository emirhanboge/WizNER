    "text": "152\u00a0mm howitzer M1909/30 () was a &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; 152.4\u00a0mm (6 inch) howitzer, a modernization of the &lt;a href=\"152%20mm%20howitzer%20M1909\"&gt;152 mm howitzer M1909&lt;/a&gt;, initially designed by &lt;a href=\"Schneider%20Electric\"&gt;Schneider&lt;/a&gt;. It was the most numerous 152\u00a0mm howitzer employed by &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment and production history.\nFrom the late 1920s the RKKA sought to upgrade its &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;-era artillery pieces. One of the modernized weapons was the &lt;a href=\"152%20mm%20howitzer%20M1909\"&gt;152 mm howitzer M1909&lt;/a&gt;, initially designed by the French arms manufacturer Schneider. After a number of experiments it was determined that the muzzle velocity of the piece could be increased to about 395\u00a0m/s (further increase could result in a damage to the carriage). In 1930 at the &lt;a href=\"Obukhov%20State%20Plant\"&gt;Bolshevik Plant&lt;/a&gt;, the gun was experimentally fitted with a &lt;a href=\"muzzle%20brake\"&gt;muzzle brake&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1930-1931, the &lt;a href=\"Perm%2C%20Russia\"&gt;Perm&lt;/a&gt; plant developed a modernization project. Initially, the only element of the project was lengthening the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20%28weaponry%29\"&gt;chamber&lt;/a&gt; to 340\u00a0mm (upgraded &lt;a href=\"gun%20barrel\"&gt;barrels&lt;/a&gt; received a mark \"lengthened chamber\"). In late production pieces minor changes in breechblock, cradle and elevation mechanism were introduced. Some pieces also had their wooden wheels replaced by steel ones with rubber tires. The modernized weapon was officially adopted as 152-mm howitzer model 1909/30.\nThe M1909/30 was a typical short-barrel howitzer, intended mostly for shooting with elevations from +20\u00b0 to +41\u00b0, using separately loaded ammunition. The gun had interrupted screw breechblock; hydraulic recoil buffer and &lt;a href=\"Hydraulic%20recoil%20mechanism\"&gt;hydro-pneumatic&lt;/a&gt; recuperator were both mounted under the barrel. The carriage was of single trail type with limited traverse and, typically, unsprung wooden wheels (some pieces produced from 1937 had metal wheels with solid rubber &lt;a href=\"tire\"&gt;tire&lt;/a&gt;s). With the gun was issued &lt;a href=\"Limbers%20and%20Caissons%20%28military%29\"&gt;limber&lt;/a&gt;, which had either wooden or metal wheels.\nFrom 1931 to 1941 the Perm plant delivered 2,188 pieces.\nOrganization and employment.\nUnder the organization of 1939, each rifle &lt;a href=\"division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; had a howitzer &lt;a href=\"regiment\"&gt;regiment&lt;/a&gt; with a 152-mm howitzers &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt; (12 pieces). In July 1941 these regiment were cancelled. Same fate befell 152-mm howitzers battalions of motorized and armored divisions.\nCorps artillery units didn't employ 152-mm howitzers early in the war (they did use howitzer-guns ML-20); but from late 1943 the recreated corps artillery included a regiment consisted of five batteries (totaling 20 pieces), equipped, along with other types, with 152-mm howitzers. By 1 June 1944, there were 192 such pieces in corps artillery.\nReserve of the Main Command included howitzer regiments (48 pieces) and heavy howitzer &lt;a href=\"brigade\"&gt;brigade&lt;/a&gt;s (32 pieces), sometimes organized into artillery divisions.\nThe howitzer was used by the RKKA in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Khalkhin%20Gol\"&gt;Battle of Khalkhin Gol&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20War\"&gt;Winter War&lt;/a&gt;. At the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"German-Soviet%20War\"&gt;German-Soviet War&lt;/a&gt; the M1909/30 was still the most numerous 152-mm howitzer in Soviet service. On 1 June 1941, the RKKA possessed about 2,500 pieces, about twice as much as the newer &lt;a href=\"152%20mm%20howitzer%20M1938%20%28M-10%29\"&gt;M-10s&lt;/a&gt;, which were soon removed from production. Although from 1943 the M1909/30 was again being gradually replaced, this time by &lt;a href=\"152-mm%20howitzer%20M1943%20%28D-1%29\"&gt;D-1&lt;/a&gt;, it was still in service by the end of the war.\nA number of guns of this type fell into the hands of &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt; in 1941-42; these were adopted as 15,2\u00a0cm sFH 445(r). Germans also produced ammunition for these guns. Most of the pieces were assigned to coastal artillery.\n&lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Army\"&gt;Finnish Army&lt;/a&gt; captured 14 pieces during the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20War\"&gt;Winter War&lt;/a&gt;, and 85 more early in the &lt;a href=\"Continuation%20War\"&gt;Continuation War&lt;/a&gt;. The guns were actively used in combat. As a training weapon, the M1909/30 remained in Finnish service until the 1980s.\nSummary.\nThe M1909/30 was a relatively minor upgrade of a World War I-era howitzer, which did not address the main flaws of the latter, namely:\nA short barrel meant short range, less than that of its main adversaries, such as the German &lt;a href=\"15%20cm%20sFH%2018\"&gt;15 cm sFH 18&lt;/a&gt; (8.8\u00a0km vs 13.3\u00a0km). Low muzzle velocity and small traverse also made the gun helpless against enemy armor.\nOn the other side, the M1909/30 was rugged and reliable. It was also relatively light and could be set up for combat in 30\u201340 seconds. Thanks to it, the howitzer was well liked in the RKKA.\nIn 1930 the Soviet Union still was not ready for development and mass production of modern artillery, so the upgrade of old guns was a reasonable decision.\nAmmunition.\nWhen set to fragmentation action, the OF-530 produced fragments which covered an area 70 m wide and 30 m deep. When set to HE action, the exploding shell produced a crater about 3.5 m in diameter and about 1.2 m deep.\nSurviving pieces.\nThe gun can be seen:"
