He participated as a protagonist in the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"social%20movement\"&gt;social movement&lt;/a&gt;s of the 1960s and the 1970s, since the 1968 movement in which he was part of the Coordination team of the Departments of Science, of the Workers\u2019 Committee and as leader of the movement at the Faculty of Engineering, &lt;a href=\"Sapienza%20University%20of%20Rome\"&gt;University of Rome&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the main representatives of the 77 movement, he was the director of a radio station Radio Citt\u00e0 Futura, the first free Italian radio, which was the voice of the Italian movement between 1979 and 1985.\nHe is the most important representative of the \u2018alternative\u2019 trade unionism in Italy, although his activity goes beyond trade unionism.

He is still the spokesman of the Cobas school unit and of the Cobas Confederation. The latter includes the following units: School, Health, Public sector and Private sector.\nHe played a main role in the organization of the World and European Social Forum against the liberal &lt;a href=\"globalization\"&gt;globalization&lt;/a&gt; movement starting from the first edition of the World Social Forum (WSF) in Porto Alegre in 2001 and of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Social%20Forum\"&gt;European Social Forum&lt;/a&gt; (ESF) in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. He is also among the leaders of the \u2018noglobal\u2019 Italian movement, which was born in Genoa during the anti-&lt;a href=\"G8\"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt; days in July 2001.\nHe is still one of the most important representatives of WSF and of the ESF and he is a member of the International Council of the WSF.\nBibliography.\nHe has written, among other essays and articles, the following books:"
