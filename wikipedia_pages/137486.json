When the rail line connecting the lower &lt;a href=\"Delmarva%20Peninsula\"&gt;Delmarva Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; to the markets of the northeast was built in 1884, several new towns were created along its route which bypassed many of the shore\u2019s older established communities. Parksley was the second such planned town on the Virginia shore (after &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Charles%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Cape Charles&lt;/a&gt; at the railroad\u2019s southern terminus in &lt;a href=\"Northampton%20County%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Northampton County&lt;/a&gt;) and was laid out in 1885 under the management of the Parksley Land Improvement Company. In 1898, town leaders made an unsuccessful attempt to relocate the county seat from &lt;a href=\"Accomac%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Accomac&lt;/a&gt; to the Parksley. The town was incorporated in 1904. During the first half of the 20th century, Parksley became an important shipping point for seafood and agricultural products harvested from the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean in Accomack County. During World War II, Parksley was the site of the Shore National Guard Armory and its airfield was utilized by the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Air%20Patrol\"&gt;Civil Air Patrol&lt;/a&gt;, part of military reconnaissance activities guarding the east coast of the United States against possible German invasion. Parksley was home to the &lt;a href=\"Parksley%20Spuds\"&gt;Parksley Spuds&lt;/a&gt;, a team which played in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Shore%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;Eastern Shore Baseball League&lt;/a&gt;."
