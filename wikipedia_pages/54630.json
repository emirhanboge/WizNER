On &lt;a href=\"Australia%20Day\"&gt;Australia Day&lt;/a&gt;, 26 January 2016, Arena was recognised in the \"Australia Day Honours\" and appointed a Member in the General Division of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Order of Australia&lt;/a&gt; \"for significant service to the music industry as a singer, songwriter, and recording artist, and as a supporter of charitable groups.\" In 2016 Arena was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM).\nIn March 2019, the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Government of Australia&lt;/a&gt; appointed Arena as a board member of the &lt;a href=\"Australia%20Council%20for%20the%20Arts\"&gt;Australia Council for the Arts&lt;/a&gt; for a three-year term. The Australia Council for the Arts, informally known as the \"Australia Council\", is the principal &lt;a href=\"arts%20council\"&gt;arts council&lt;/a&gt; or arts funding body of the federal government of Australia.\nLife and career.\n1967\u201387: Early life and career beginnings.\nArena was born in the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; suburb of &lt;a href=\"Keilor%20East\"&gt;Keilor East&lt;/a&gt;, to Giuseppe \"Joe\" Arena and Francesca \"Franca\" Catalfamo (both from &lt;a href=\"Valguarnera%20Caropepe\"&gt;Valguarnera&lt;/a&gt;, Sicily), &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicilian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Immigration%20to%20Australia\"&gt;immigrants&lt;/a&gt;, in Melbourne on 1 November 1967. Giuseppe was a rural worker in &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt; and then a cane cutter in Cairns in 1955. By the following year he was a labourer in Melbourne and later worked for &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Railways\"&gt;Victorian Railways&lt;/a&gt;. Arena grew up in Keilor East, Victoria with two sisters, Nancy and Silvana; As a child, she listened to Spanish, Italian and French songs that were in her family's record collection. At the age of six, she was the flower girl at her cousin Gaetano's wedding, and at the reception she urged her father to approach the host so that she could sing\u2014&lt;a href=\"Daryl%20Braithwaite\"&gt;Daryl Braithwaite&lt;/a&gt;'s version of \"&lt;a href=\"You%27re%20My%20World\"&gt;You're My World&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014it was her first public performance.\nArena's family call her Pina, which is her shortened first name. She changed her first name from Filippina to \"Tina\", her stage name becoming \"Tina Arena\", when she appeared as a child performer on the national television talent show \"&lt;a href=\"Young%20Talent%20Time\"&gt;Young Talent Time&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1974, at age seven. For secondary schooling, she attended a Catholic girls' college, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Columba%27s%20College%2C%20Essendon\"&gt;St. Columba's College, Essendon&lt;/a&gt;, in Melbourne. Recalling her upbringing, Arena says, \"It was a very Italian household, it was a very traditional household. There was a lot of love but there was a lot of discipline. And there was no room for pretentiousness. Really, there just wasn't.\"\nYoung Talent Time years.\nArena received singing lessons from Voila Ritchie who recommended her to appear on a television talent quest and variety show, \"&lt;a href=\"Young%20Talent%20Time\"&gt;Young Talent Time&lt;/a&gt;\", an Australian weekly television variety programme produced by Lewis-Young Productions and screened on &lt;a href=\"Network%20Ten\"&gt;Network Ten&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Arena was selected to appear on \"Young Talent Time\", the producers at Lewis-Young Productions and &lt;a href=\"Network%20Ten\"&gt;Network Ten&lt;/a&gt; asked her to change her first name from Filippina to \"Tina\"\u2014creating her stage name \"Tina Arena\"\u2014so as to be more \"relatable\" to the wider national audience. In the mid-1970s, there was a minority of ethnic diversity represented in the Australian mainstream media, especially on primetime television. Initially appearing as a \"Young Talent Time\" contestant in 1974, at age eight, Arena went on to permanently join the cast as a regular member of the show's \"Young Talent Team\" in 1975, at age nine. She then quickly, and affectionately, became known on the show by her nickname \"Tiny Tina\". For her first appearance she performed &lt;a href=\"ABBA\"&gt;ABBA&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Ring%20Ring%20%28ABBA%20song%29\"&gt;Ring Ring&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAs a core member of the \"Young Talent Team\" performing live on Australian national television each week, Arena sang cover versions of popular music tracks. In 1977, she released a &lt;a href=\"split%20album\"&gt;split album&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Tiny%20Tina%20and%20Little%20John\"&gt;Tiny Tina and Little John&lt;/a&gt;\", alternating tracks with fellow \"Young Talent Team\" member, John Bowles.\nAs a member of \"Young Talent Team\", Arena appeared in TV specials, in TV commercials, at shopping centres, and on tourist venues. In September 1982, she became a \"coach\" for new team members, &lt;a href=\"Dannii%20Minogue\"&gt;Danielle Minogue&lt;/a&gt; and Mark McCormack; Arena told \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Australian%20Women%27s%20Weekly\"&gt;The Australian Women's Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\"s &lt;a href=\"Debra%20Byrne\"&gt;Debbie Byrne&lt;/a&gt; that \"They seem to be settling down a lot quicker than I did. They both have a really professional attitude.\" At 14, she told Byrne \"my aim: to be a recording artist and actress but, now, I have to concentrate simply on what I'm doing and that can take enough effort.\"\nArena departed the \"&lt;a href=\"Young%20Talent%20Time\"&gt;Young Talent Time&lt;/a&gt;\" show in October 1983, ahead of her 16th birthday, due to the &lt;a href=\"Network%20Ten\"&gt;Network Ten&lt;/a&gt; \"Young Talent Time\" series age-limit contract stipulation to give way for younger members. Arena performed the songs \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Way%20We%20Were%20%28song%29\"&gt;The Way We Were&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"MacArthur%20Park%20%28song%29\"&gt;MacArthur Park&lt;/a&gt;\" for her finale set on her farewell to \"Young Talent Time\" episode. Arena starred on \"Young Talent Time\" from 1976 to 1983\u2014making her the show's longest-serving cast member.\nArena completed her &lt;a href=\"Higher%20School%20Certificate%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Higher School Certificate&lt;/a&gt; (final year of secondary school) and was hired as an insurance clerk; however, she resigned after three months to pursue a music career.\nSpeaking at her BIGSOUND keynote address in 2017, Arena described her childhood to teenage experience on \"Young Talent Time\" as an inclusive apprenticeship into the television light-entertainment and musical industry in Australia, Arena noted:\nIt was 40 years ago and there were no ethnic faces on [Australian] television. It was an extraordinary apprenticeship. Young Talent Time was inclusive and welcoming. The only downside of Young Talent Time was when I was trying to transition to an adult.\nStarting a solo recording career.\nAt age 17, Arena signed a record deal with Graffiti Records, which released her debut single, \"&lt;a href=\"Turn%20Up%20the%20Beat\"&gt;Turn Up the Beat&lt;/a&gt;\", in 1985. Australian musicologist, &lt;a href=\"Ian%20McFarlane\"&gt;Ian McFarlane&lt;/a&gt;, described it as having a \"dance-pop\" style. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald\"&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;\"s Tim Elliott reflected that it \"failed to impress.\" It had been recorded in the previous year with &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Cadd\"&gt;Brian Cadd&lt;/a&gt; producing at Flagstaff Studios in Melbourne. When the single did not appear in the top\u00a050 her planned album was scrapped.\nFollowing her 1985 recording, Arena sang advertisement jingles and she worked on the pub and club circuit to earn a living. She performed solo shows and in bands, including as a member of a nine-piece ensemble, Network. She also appeared in musicals. In 1987, she supported American artist, &lt;a href=\"Lionel%20Richie\"&gt;Lionel Richie&lt;/a&gt; on his Australian tour, following a number of charity performances.\n1988\u201393: Debut solo album \u2013 \"Strong as Steel\".\nDuring 1988, Arena appeared as a guest on Australian TV shows recalling her tenure on \"Young Talent Time\" and looking for a new record label. In 1990, she had a singing and dancing role in the David Atkins' musical, \"Dynamite\", for a 10-month run. Also that year she signed with &lt;a href=\"EMI\"&gt;EMI&lt;/a&gt; and reinvented her image as a raunchy &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt; diva. In April she issued a single, \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Need%20Your%20Body\"&gt;I Need Your Body&lt;/a&gt;\", which peaked at No.\u00a03 on the &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Charts\"&gt;ARIA Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;. McFarlane described it as \"uptempo\" with the associated music video \"projecting a raunchy disco-diva persona\u00a0... flaunting a pouting rock starlet with bouncing cleavage and attitude to burn.\" Australian journalist, &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Nimmervoll\"&gt;Ed Nimmervoll&lt;/a&gt;, noticed that she used \"raunchy videos showing off her cleavage as if to prove she was a woman now.\"\nThe artist followed with another single, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Machine%27s%20Breaking%20Down\"&gt;The Machine's Breaking Down&lt;/a&gt;\", in July 1990, which peaked in the top\u00a030. Her debut solo album, \"&lt;a href=\"Strong%20as%20Steel\"&gt;Strong as Steel&lt;/a&gt;\", was released in October, and peaked at number\u00a017 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Most of the album was produced by Ross Inglis. Penelope Layland of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Canberra%20Times\"&gt;The Canberra Times&lt;/a&gt;\" opined that \"the frantic single, 'I Need Your Body', is quite uncharacteristic of much of the music on Tina Arena's album, \"Strong As Steel\". In fact, it is one of the weakest tracks on an album which bounces with potential pop hits.\"\nAccording to music historian &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Nimmervoll\"&gt;Ed Nimmervoll&lt;/a&gt;, Arena \"was not comfortable. This was not her. This was not what she wanted to be for the rest of her life. Tina went into seclusion while she decided what to do next, moving to Los Angeles to be a nobody again.\" She had relocated to LA in 1991, where she took more singing lessons and started song writing. Upon return to Australia, in 1993, she performed in the local December 1992 to February 1993 musical theatre production, \"&lt;a href=\"Joseph%20and%20the%20Amazing%20Technicolor%20Dreamcoat\"&gt;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&lt;/a&gt;\", as the Narrator, at the &lt;a href=\"State%20Theatre%20%28Melbourne%29\"&gt;State Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, Melbourne. In 1992 Arena sang background vocals on the debut album by Australian singer-songwriter &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Price\"&gt;Rick Price&lt;/a&gt;, titled \"&lt;a href=\"Heaven%20Knows%20%28Rick%20Price%20album%29\"&gt;Heaven Knows&lt;/a&gt;\", which was released in July 1992, and she appeared in the 1993 music video by Price for the single \"&lt;a href=\"A%20House%20Divided%20%28song%29\"&gt;A House Divided&lt;/a&gt;\".\n1994\u201396: Second solo album \u2013 \"Don't Ask\".\nTina Arena's second solo studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Ask\"&gt;Don't Ask&lt;/a&gt;\", was released on 14 November 1994, and was produced by &lt;a href=\"David%20Tyson\"&gt;David Tyson&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Records\"&gt;Columbia Records&lt;/a&gt;. According to Nimmervoll during recording \"Tina nearly broke down. This was an all-important moment in her career.\" Arena co-wrote all ten tracks of the original Australian version.\nArena stated, \"I had gotten used to singing other people's songs, but this time they are my songs and my experience so I can sing them like I mean it. The record is honest and sincere and simple.\"\nIan McFarlane noticed it demonstrated a \"more mature, sophisticated, soul-tinged style and approach\u00a0... [and] her powerful, crystal clear voice more than adequately matched the material on offer.\" Kelvin Hayes of AllMusic felt that \"a lot of \"Don't Ask\" remains twee. However, there are good moments.\" It peaked at No.\u00a01 on the ARIA Albums Chart\u2014a year after its release\u2014and remained in the top\u00a050 for 83\u00a0weeks. It reached No.\u00a011 on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Albums%20Chart\"&gt;UK Albums Chart&lt;/a&gt; and No.\u00a012 in &lt;a href=\"Official%20New%20Zealand%20Music%20Chart\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Don't Ask\" was the highest-selling album of 1995 in Australia and one of the biggest-selling albums by an Australian female singer to date. It has sold over two million copies worldwide and was certified 10\u00a0times platinum by ARIA in 2011 for shipment of over 700,000 copies in that country alone. The success of the record made her a \"priority artist\" for &lt;a href=\"Sony%20Music%20Entertainment\"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, who marketed her in the US. Her European success was realised: \"Don't Ask\" charted in Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.\nThe lead single, \"&lt;a href=\"Chains%20%28Tina%20Arena%20song%29\"&gt;Chains&lt;/a&gt;\", was issued ahead of the album in August 1994, in Australia, and peaked at No.\u00a04 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It also reached No.\u00a06 in the UK, No.\u00a07 in New Zealand, No.\u00a09 in Ireland and No.\u00a020 in Canada. In 1995, she toured Europe, appearing on \"&lt;a href=\"Top%20of%20the%20Pops\"&gt;Top of the Pops&lt;/a&gt;\", which broadcast to an audience of 60\u00a0million people. In the European market Arena was an unknown and a fresh commodity, she opined: \"I loved every minute of that\u2014of people not knowing who I was. I guess it was tiring fighting the individual thing. It was good to not be a part of a past and being accepted as an artist. Not having to carry this \"Young Talent Time\" luggage which was constantly shoved in my face.\" Five additional singles were released, \"&lt;a href=\"Sorrento%20Moon%20%28I%20Remember%29\"&gt;Sorrento Moon (I Remember)&lt;/a&gt;\" (January 1995), \"&lt;a href=\"Heaven%20Help%20My%20Heart\"&gt;Heaven Help My Heart&lt;/a&gt;\" (May), \"&lt;a href=\"Wasn%27t%20It%20Good%20%28Tina%20Arena%20song%29\"&gt;Wasn't It Good&lt;/a&gt;\" (September), \"&lt;a href=\"Show%20Me%20Heaven\"&gt;Show Me Heaven&lt;/a&gt;\" (November) and \"That's the Way a Woman Feels\" (February 1996).\nAt the &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%201995\"&gt;ARIA Music Awards of 1995&lt;/a&gt; Arena was nominated in six categories and won four trophies: &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Release\"&gt;Best Pop Release&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Award%20for%20Song%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Song of the Year&lt;/a&gt; for \"Chains\"; and &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Album of the Year&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Artist\"&gt;Best Female Artist&lt;/a&gt; for \"Don't Ask\". At the &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%201996\"&gt;1996 ceremony&lt;/a&gt; she received five more nominations and won Highest Selling Album for \"Don't Ask\". Other accolades she earned were Variety Club Entertainer of the Year, an Advance Australia Foundation award, and a World Music Award.\n1997\u20132000: \"In Deep\" and the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\nArena relocated to Los Angeles in 1996 and 1997, to record her third solo studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"In%20Deep%20%28Tina%20Arena%20album%29\"&gt;In Deep&lt;/a&gt;\" (18 August 1997), which became her second number-one album in Australia. For the Australian version of the album Arena co-wrote eleven of its twelve tracks\u2014her fellow writers include &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Jones%20%28Foreigner%29\"&gt;Mick Jones&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a href=\"Foreigner%20%28band%29\"&gt;Foreigner&lt;/a&gt;), David Tyson, &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Ward%20%28songwriter%29\"&gt;Christopher Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dean%20McTaggart\"&gt;Dean McTaggart&lt;/a&gt;, Pam Reswick and Steve Werfel. The album included her cover version of Foreigner's \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Want%20to%20Know%20What%20Love%20Is%23Tina%20Arena%20version\"&gt;I Want to Know What Love Is&lt;/a&gt;\", originally written by Jones who produced Arena's version. \"In Deep\" \"was recorded predominantly live in the studio in an attempt to bring the material closer to Tina's stage performance persona\" with four tracks produced by Tyson and the rest by Jones. \"In Deep\" was certified 3\u00d7 platinum in Australia. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic found the US version of the album showed that \"Her own songs, co-written with a team of others, are perfectly good contemporary pop/rock, and she sings them with passionate commitment\" and it was \"brimming with potential hit singles (it spawned three in Australia).\"\n\"In Deep\", in its different versions, provided ten singles, with the lead one, \"&lt;a href=\"Burn%20%28Tina%20Arena%20song%29\"&gt;Burn&lt;/a&gt;\", appearing in July 1997, which had some US airplay. The track was co-written by Arena with Reswick and Werfel. In Australian it debuted at No.\u00a02 and was certified gold upon its release. It was also a hit in Asia. Besides the English-language version she also recorded it in Spanish and Italian (in the form of \"&lt;a href=\"Ti%20Voglio%20Qui\"&gt;Ti Voglio Qui&lt;/a&gt;\"). The second single, \"&lt;a href=\"If%20I%20Didn%27t%20Love%20You%20%28Tina%20Arena%20song%29\"&gt;If I Didn't Love You&lt;/a&gt;\" (November) appeared in the ARIA top\u00a050. In April of the following year she issued \"&lt;a href=\"Now%20I%20Can%20Dance\"&gt;Now I Can Dance&lt;/a&gt;\", which peaked at No.\u00a013. In the UK Arena released \"Whistle Down the Wind\" (June 1998) as a cover version single, it was the title track from the 1996 musical of &lt;a href=\"Whistle%20Down%20the%20Wind%20%281996%20musical%29\"&gt;the same name&lt;/a&gt;, her version reached the UK Singles Chart top\u00a030.\nIn April 1998, Arena performed at the 50th birthday celebration for &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber\"&gt;Andrew Lloyd Webber&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Albert%20Hall\"&gt;Royal Albert Hall&lt;/a&gt; in London. Arena performed at the celebration, along with &lt;a href=\"John%20Farnham\"&gt;John Farnham&lt;/a&gt;, and featured musical performances by &lt;a href=\"Elaine%20Paige\"&gt;Elaine Paige&lt;/a&gt;.\nArena's duet with US artist, &lt;a href=\"Marc%20Anthony\"&gt;Marc Anthony&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Want%20to%20Spend%20My%20Lifetime%20Loving%20You\"&gt;I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You&lt;/a&gt;\", from the feature film soundtrack for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mask%20of%20Zorro\"&gt;The Mask of Zorro&lt;/a&gt;\" (July 1998), gained her European chart success. The track was issued as a non-album single in Australia in September, but did not reach the top\u00a050. It was included on the French release version of \"In Deep\", appearing in October, which peaked at No.\u00a03 on the &lt;a href=\"Syndicat%20National%20de%20l%27%C3%89dition%20Phonographique\"&gt;French Albums Chart&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a year after its first entry\u2014and spent 88 weeks on that chart. It also reached the top\u00a010 in Belgium and top\u00a040 in Switzerland. It was certified 3\u00d7 platinum by Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique (SNEP) in May 2001 for sales in France. \"I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You\" had been issued in Europe in September 1998, it peaked at No.\u00a03 in France\u2014her first charting single in that market. It also reached No.\u00a03 in &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Top%2040\"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and top\u00a010 in Belgium.\nArena toured the US from March 1999, to promote the album's local release, as well as another single, \"&lt;a href=\"If%20I%20Was%20a%20River\"&gt;If I Was a River&lt;/a&gt;\", which did peak in the UK top\u00a040. Sony attempted to \"break\" Arena into the US market by the release of \"If I Was a River\", penned by &lt;a href=\"Diane%20Warren\"&gt;Diane Warren&lt;/a&gt;. Ruhlmann felt the label had an \"obvious plan is to turn her into a down-under Celine Dion\" however the album and its singles \"had no commercial impact upon release in the U.S.\" and \"must be considered a disappointment.\" Her US foray included appearances on TV shows such as \"&lt;a href=\"Donny%20%26amp%3B%20Marie%20%281998%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Donny &amp; Marie&lt;/a&gt;\". In February 1999, she teamed with label-mate &lt;a href=\"Donna%20Summer\"&gt;Donna Summer&lt;/a&gt; to perform a cover version of \"&lt;a href=\"No%20More%20Tears%20%28Enough%20Is%20Enough%29\"&gt;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&lt;/a&gt;\"; the duet appeared on Summer's live album, \"&lt;a href=\"Live%20%26amp%3B%20More%20Encore\"&gt;Live &amp; More Encore&lt;/a&gt;\" (June 1999).\nArena's first French-language single, \"&lt;a href=\"Aller%20plus%20haut\"&gt;Aller plus haut&lt;/a&gt;\" (English: \"Go Higher\", July 1999), appeared on the continental version of \"In Deep\", which peaked at No.\u00a02 on the local singles chart; it has sold 600,000 copies in that country. It also became her first number-one hit on the Belgian Singles Chart.

Arena's most recent release, \"&lt;a href=\"Eleven%20%28Tina%20Arena%20album%29\"&gt;Eleven&lt;/a&gt;\", became her seventh Top 10 album in Australia by debuting at No. 2 on the ARIA album chart in November 2016, and is now certified gold.\nIn September 2015, Arena hosted shows on SmoothFM Radio Stations from 4:00\u00a0pm every Saturday on Sydney's SmoothFM 93.5 and on Melbourne's SmoothFM 91.5.\nOn 25 October 2015, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association\"&gt;Australian Recording Industry Association&lt;/a&gt; (ARIA) announced that Arena was due to be inducted into their &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in the annual awards ceremony in November as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Music%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Australian music&lt;/a&gt; industry &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;ARIA Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. In mid-November ARIA announced that she would be inducted by Australian-British singer and actress &lt;a href=\"Kylie%20Minogue\"&gt;Kylie Minogue&lt;/a&gt;, also a Hall of Fame inductee\u2014and the sister of singer &lt;a href=\"Dannii%20Minogue\"&gt;Dannii Minogue&lt;/a&gt;, a former \"Young Talent Time\" contestant. Arena looks forward to enjoying the acknowledgment of her peers at the Australian music industry's gala celebration on 26 November 2015. She is quick to point out that receiving the honour doesn't mean she is entering the twilight of her career. \"It's not the end,\" she says, \"Not yet\", adding, \"I don't have another 40 years in me, I don't know how long it's going to last, but I'm touched by the recognition. It will be an emotional night\". On 26 November 2015, Arena was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;ARIA Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; at the 2015 ARIA Awards ceremony.\nDuring Arena's &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; ceremony induction on 26 November 2015, fellow Australian songstress &lt;a href=\"Kylie%20Minogue\"&gt;Kylie Minogue&lt;/a&gt;\u2014also a Hall of Fame inductee\u2014paid tribute to Arena by stating, \"I remember being blown away when she sang \"&lt;a href=\"MacArthur%20Park%20%28song%29\"&gt;MacArthur Park&lt;/a&gt;\" on \"&lt;a href=\"Young%20Talent%20Time\"&gt;Young Talent Time&lt;/a&gt;\", and I tried countless times to try and sing that song the way she did it and couldn't do it. She has the pipes. She could teach us all a lesson.\" This was a nod to Arena's entire career, as one of the Australia's highest-selling female artists, and her childhood fame on \"Young Talent Time\" from 1976 to 1983\u2014making her the show's longest-serving cast member.\nSpeaking with MOZA Music in a January 2019 interview, Arena stated that:\nOne of my favourite moments was the Arias hall of fame induction in 2015. For myself that moment meant that I could speak freely about the industry, which I obviously love, but feel that there are far too many inequalities. Also the sheer volume of music that is made available to people makes it difficult to financially exist.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Australia%20Day\"&gt;Australia Day&lt;/a&gt;, 26 January 2016, Arena was recognised in the \"Australia Day Honours\", which the &lt;a href=\"Monarchy%20of%20Australia\"&gt;country's sovereign&lt;/a&gt; awards its citizens for actions or deeds that benefit the nation.

The album is a 2-CD set\u2014the first contains 17 of Arena's hits; the second is an album of interpretations.The interpretations disc includes a duet with &lt;a href=\"Dannii%20Minogue\"&gt;Dannii Minogue&lt;/a&gt;, singing with Arena for the first time since \"&lt;a href=\"Young%20Talent%20Time\"&gt;Young Talent Time&lt;/a&gt;\".\nArena announced her \"Innocence to Understanding Tour\" in conjunction with the release of her \"&lt;a href=\"Greatest%20Hits%20%26amp%3B%20Interpretations\"&gt;Greatest Hits &amp; Interpretations&lt;/a&gt;\", starting in concerts Brisbane on Wednesday, 6 September 2017, and concluded in early October. The title of the tour is a telling nod to her career journey, one of only a few artists who has been able to live four decades in music.\nIn early May 2017, Arena released her first fragrance, after working three years on the project, called \"Renaissance\" developed with &lt;a href=\"Bertrand%20Duchaufour\"&gt;Bertrand Duchaufour&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world's leading perfumers in Paris. Bertrand have come up with a high-quality Eau De Parfum combining ingredients sourced from Arena's three cultures: France, Italy and Australia, including &lt;a href=\"sandalwood\"&gt;sandalwood&lt;/a&gt; from Indigenous Australia.\nIn June 2017, Arena featured as the portraiture guest on the Australian TV series \"Anh Do's Brush with Fame\" aired on ABC. Arena shared journey from child star to international artist the challenges and sacrifices that have shaped her. &lt;a href=\"Anh%20Do\"&gt;Anh Do&lt;/a&gt; is a Vietnamese-born Australian author, actor, comedian, and artist. He was three-times a finalist in the annual &lt;a href=\"Archibald%20Prize\"&gt;Archibald Prize&lt;/a&gt; art award.\nIn September 2017, Arena featured as a keynote speaker at the Australian BIGSOUND Musical Conference.

Arena's keynote speech shared her experience and her advice for the changing face of the music industry, having been at the forefront of the Australian music scene for 40 years.\n2018: \"Quand tout Recommence\".\nAfter almost a decade away, Arena made a welcome return to French Pop music, arriving with a new 2018 French-language album, \"&lt;a href=\"Quand%20tout%20Recommence\"&gt;Quand tout Recommence&lt;/a&gt;\" (translates to: \"When Everything Restarts\"), set for an April release, to the &lt;a href=\"francophone\"&gt;francophone&lt;/a&gt; music market (primarily France) and also reaching audiences in Belgium and Sweden. \"Quand tout Recommence\" is Arena's third French-language studio album, and her twelfth studio album overall, since her francophone album, \"&lt;a href=\"7%20vies\"&gt;7 vies&lt;/a&gt;\", released in January 2008, which debuted at No.\u00a012 on the official French charts; her highest debut in France.\nThe new album title \"Quand tout Recommence\" translates to \"When Everything Restarts\" in English. Arena has stated that when she records in the French language, she is careful not to record French versions of her English-language hits, as lyric meanings in French and English differ. Arena notes that too often the intention of the song gets \"lost in translation\", therefore she has always chosen to write in both languages.\nOn 17 November 2017, Arena released on digital preview platforms a new song recording, \"&lt;a href=\"Tant%20que%20tu%20es%20l%C3%A0\"&gt;Tant que tu es l\u00e0&lt;/a&gt;\" (translates to: \"As long as you're around\"), as the lead single for the upcoming album,\"Quand tout Recommence\".\nIn an April 2018 interview with \"Webmedia SAS Pure Charts\" (France), Arena defined what pulled her into the French Pop music after a decade away, recording and performing in her homeland Australia and in selective international showcase tours, Arena explains, \"I wanted to re-do music in French. Everything started from there with this project. The desire\". She is motivated by the desire to reconnect with the success of her French Pop hits, \"Go higher\" and \"Love to the impossible\". On her 2018 \"Quand tout Recommence\" album, Arena offers ten new songs recorded in the language of Moli\u00e8re, \"L'ombre de ma voix\" (Translates to: The Shadow of My Voice\"). The contents of songs on the record is quite varied. Recalling her former residency in French Pop Music, yet, her inaugural entry on the French Music Charts was in 1998, and was her first French platinum record. Arena concludes, \"\"I miss the connection with the French public. It was time. With all that happened.\" Good, is what happens with Arena, and France.\nOn 16 February 2018, Arena released on digital preview platforms the next single, \"L'ombre de ma voix\" (\"The Shadow of My Voice\"), from her new album \"Quand tout Recommence\".\nOn 6 April 2018, the new French-language album, \"Quand tout Recommence\" was released on the francophone market, with the album peaking on the French album chart Top 150 at No.62, and also peaking on the Belgium album chart at No.46. The two single releases and the complete album, \"Quand tout recommence\", are now available to download and stream worldwide.\n2018: Music Video \"L'ombre de ma voix\".\nAn accompanying official music video for \"L'ombre de ma voix\" (Translates to: \"The Shadow of My Voice\"), was released on 16 February 2018. The 2018 music video director is Michael Westbrook, with production by Positive Dream R\u00e9alisation.\nThe video thematically delivers a nostalgic mood, as Arena traces her 40-year career in the music industry, showing a montage of video footage and TV clips across her lifespan as a live performer. Capturing the visual evolution of Arena's artistry, beginning in 1974 for the then-eight-year-old child performer on the Australian family-entertainment television musical live talent show \"&lt;a href=\"Young%20Talent%20Time\"&gt;Young Talent Time&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn the \"Quand tout Recommence\" music video, Arena appears multiple times in every frame, and it doubles and triples; Arena is seen as the artist she is today, in the recording studio, and throughout the footage of clips revolving around her, as she is evolving through her career. The montage chronicles Arena's childhood, and adolescence, to womanhood\u2014including childhood piano lessons, roller-skating, backstage rehearsals, signing autographs with fans, to singing live at the Sydney Olympic Games 2000, and more. Clearly, Tina Arena has always got to work, sung her heart out and in again, and she keeps working. The song title, \"The Shadow of My Voice\", makes a report on 40 years her a career, composed of ups and downs, and mixes childhood images, live performances, and studio sessions. The opportunity is taken by the Australian to prove that she is still active and far from relying on her previous success.\n2018\u2013present.\nIn January 2018, Arena performed as part of the live-music program at the Australian Open 2018 Grand Slam &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; tournament, at &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Park\"&gt;Melbourne Park&lt;/a&gt;.

I felt I had a lot of living and learning before I could get up and take on the enormity of the story and the human spirit she possessed. I don't think I was ready in my 30s to play Eva Per\u00f3n at all. Playing the role of Eva Per\u00f3n at 50, is much more suited to the life experience that I have had.\nArena expressed of knowing about &lt;a href=\"Eva%20Per%C3%B3n\"&gt;Eva Per\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; since she was a little girl, and feeling privileged to be able to recount the story and embrace the complex role.\nOpening Night: Sydney Opera House.\nThe official opening night of the \"Evita\" Australian tour, at the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt;, in the \"Joan Sutherland Theatre\", took place on Thursday, 13 September 2018. \"Evita\" book lyricist, Sir &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Rice\"&gt;Tim Rice&lt;/a&gt;, attended the Opening Night, having travelled especially to Australia for the event, a week after joining the illustrious \"&lt;a href=\"EGOT\"&gt;EGOT&lt;/a&gt;\" winners club. Arena as the lead role received a prolonged standing ovation for her stellar portrayal as Eva Per\u00f3n at the opening night. Sydney's \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph%20%28Sydney%29\"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\" reported following opening night that, \"Arena soars in a sublime performance of the First Lady of Argentina. Even those who don't know the musical \"Evita\", are probably familiar with the song \"&lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Cry%20for%20Me%20Argentina\"&gt;Don't Cry for Me Argentina&lt;/a&gt;\" and it was at this point on opening night that Arena really powered into her own as &lt;a href=\"Eva%20Per%C3%B3n\"&gt;Eva Per\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nNational Tour: Arts Centre Melbourne.\nThe Victorian tour leg of the \"Evita\" Australian tour was at the State Theatre at the &lt;a href=\"Arts%20Centre%20Melbourne\"&gt;Arts Centre Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, from 5 to 30 December 2018 following the Sydney Opera House premiere season.\nIn February 2019, broadway-world reported that &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Australia\"&gt;Opera Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s production \"Evita\" has become the highest selling show ever staged at the State Theatre, &lt;a href=\"Arts%20Centre%20Melbourne\"&gt;Arts Centre Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. Claire Spencer, CEO, Arts Centre Melbourne, noted that \"It is fantastic to have such an accomplished cast, including cherished global star Tina Arena perform Evita at Arts Centre Melbourne. Tina is particularly close to our hearts as one of the \"Patrons of the Australian Music Vault\" at Arts Centre Melbourne.\"\nCritical reception.\nOn 19 September 2018, the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s classical music and arts magazine &lt;a href=\"Limelight%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;\"Limelight\"&lt;/a&gt;'s theatre reviewer, Angus McPherson, gave a four-star review of Opera Australia's production \"Evita\" at the Sydney Opera House. The review, \"Evita \u2013 Tina Arena gives us a vocally high flying Evita in Hal Prince's original production\" states, \"The role of the tough, ambitious, Evita isn't an easy sing, and it comes with baggage\u2014anyone taking it on is walking in the footsteps of the likes of Elaine Paige, Patti LuPone and Madonna (in the 1996 film with Antonio Banderas)\u2014but Arena proves herself more than equal to the vocal demands. She doesn't have the heavy belt of a LuPone, but she's got a deliciously sultry low register and she handles the lighter high notes with confidence, letting rip when it's called for\u2014her rallying oration in 'A New Argentina', buoyed by the chorus, is a rousing finale to the show's first act. Brazilian opera singer Paulo Szot, brings a magisterial baritone to Juan Per\u00f3n. Arena comes into her own in the second act, with highlights including the show's hit Don't Cry For Me Argentina (in quite a broad rendition), as well as Rainbow High, Waltz for Eva and Che and You Must Love Me\u2014which was written for Madonna in the film and inserted here, Arena alone onstage, 'in concert' style. The show ends on a sombre note, and if Evita's final moments don't quite hit home emotionally, her assumption of power is thrillingly done, Arena's vocals capturing her commanding power and charisma\".\nOn 19 September 2018, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald\"&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;\" theatre reviewer, Joyce Morgan, gave a four-star review of Opera Australia's production \"Evita\" at the Sydney Opera House. The review, \"Evita review: Don't cry for Tina Arena's timely Eva\" states, \"What you do get is a show with renewed currency about the rise and demise of one of Latin America's most intriguing and controversial figures, Eva Peron. You also get a woman at the height of her musical powers in the show-stopper scene as Tina Arena, in the title role, steps regally along the presidential balcony to deliver with melting clarity and conviction the anthemic \"&lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Cry%20for%20Me%20Argentina\"&gt;Don't Cry for Me Argentina&lt;/a&gt;\". In this 40th-anniversary restaging of the original &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Prince\"&gt;Harold Prince&lt;/a&gt; production, the misogyny, sexism and patronising disdain by the powerful forces arrayed against our heroine takes the breath away. Not least because some of the abuse seems as current as that excreted by social media trolls. Rice's lyrics still pack a punch\".\nOn 20 September 2018, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" musicals reviewer, Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore, gave a four-star review of Opera Australia's production \"Evita\" at the Sydney Opera House. The review, \"Tina Arena is Resplendent and Tough as Designer Dictator\", states, \"In Opera Australia's production, Eva Per\u00f3n wins over a nation with a Christian Dior dress and steely determination, and a killer ballad steals the show. At the centre of it all is Evita, played with a resplendent toughness by Arena. It is to her credit that in a few hours she can turn from a naive, if plucky, teenager eager to leave her poor upbringing behind to a grown woman ravaged by illness and yet still desperate to cling to the last vestiges of power. The score stands the test of time too, Under director &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Prince\"&gt;Harold Prince&lt;/a&gt;'s deft hands, the song, \"&lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Cry%20for%20Me%20Argentina\"&gt;Don't Cry for Me Argentina&lt;/a&gt;\", shows its true colours: it is designed as a master class in political manipulation\".\nIn February 2019, broadway-world reported that &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Australia\"&gt;Opera Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s production \"Evita\" has become the highest selling show ever staged at the State Theatre, &lt;a href=\"Arts%20Centre%20Melbourne\"&gt;Arts Centre Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. Claire Spencer, CEO, Arts Centre Melbourne, noted that \"It is fantastic to have such an accomplished cast, including cherished global star Tina Arena perform Evita at Arts Centre Melbourne.

Arena was nominated alongside Luisa Scrofani, Natalie Abbott, and &lt;a href=\"Ursula%20Yovich\"&gt;Ursula Yovich&lt;/a&gt;. The award was won by Ursula Yovich for \"&lt;a href=\"Barbara%20and%20the%20Camp%20Dogs\"&gt;Barbara and the Camp Dogs&lt;/a&gt;\".

She is &lt;a href=\"multilingual\"&gt;multilingual&lt;/a&gt;: she speaks and sings in English, Italian and French; and also sings in Spanish. Her singing style is characterised as between &lt;a href=\"Rhythm%20and%20blues\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ballade%20%28classical%20music%29\"&gt;ballad&lt;/a&gt;.\nNumerous media and musical contemporaries have praised Arena's skill as a world-class singer. Music journalist Ed Nimmervoll commented that Arena \"has a voice that can give you goosebumps\", while news journalist Kate de Brito says that it is \"smooth and musical even when she talks.\" Cameron Adams of the \"&lt;a href=\"Herald%20Sun\"&gt;Herald Sun&lt;/a&gt;\" says she has a \"beautiful voice telling a beautiful story.\" William Yeoman of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20West%20Australian\"&gt;The West Australian&lt;/a&gt;\" commented that \"Arena's voice is redolent of both youthful pop and mature cabaret.\" The &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;'s monthly classical music and arts magazine, \"&lt;a href=\"Limelight%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Limelight&lt;/a&gt;\", commented that, \"Tina Arena is a performer with a supreme voice, boundless range and energy, and charm to spare.\" Kelsey Munro of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald\"&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;\" says that her voice is \"strong, smooth and pitch-perfect.\" According to Heidi Maier of \"Tom\" magazine, it can be described as \"remarkably strong\". She also said, \"Tina Arena has a powerhouse voice and when she hits her marks, she hits them with forcefulness and verve.\" Spiritworks Australia says, \"Whether she's singing spine-tingling renditions of contemporary classics by Lulu, Dusty Springfield or Blondie or her self-penned hits Sorrento Moon, Chains or Burn, Tina Arena is acclaimed as one of the world's most versatile and magnificent vocal interpreters. Her voice is smooth, rich and streaming with emotion.\"\nThe Queensland Music Festival team says, \"Tina sparkles with vivacity and class, possessing an outstanding vocal range and a voice that belies her petite stature\u2014endlessly powerful and always resonant with heart and honesty.\" Queensland Music Festival artistic director, James Morrison said \"Tina Arena has one of the most amazing voices I've ever heard.\" Time Out magazine had a brief description of Tina's voice as it says, \"Tina Arena truly boasts two incredible assets\u2014her voice and her versatility\u00a0...\" Melbourne's &lt;a href=\"Light%20FM\"&gt;89.9 Light FM&lt;/a&gt; declared that Arena is \"undisputedly one of Australia's finest voices\". Sharyn Hamey, an online music reviewer says that \"Arena has an angelic, beautiful and a powerful voice.\"\nFellow Australian celebrities have praised Arena's vocal prowess with &lt;a href=\"Delta%20Goodrem\"&gt;Delta Goodrem&lt;/a&gt; saying, \"Her voice has strength whilst keeping its feminine warmth to draw you in.\" Melbourne singer-songwriter, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Paynter\"&gt;Michael Paynter&lt;/a&gt; hailed Arena as \"simultaneously the most natural and supernatural female Australian voice ever. She is technically and emotionally perfect, but somehow always has enough of a sniff of imperfection and rawness to make you not only believe every word, but be hanging off them too.\" &lt;a href=\"Ricki-Lee%20Coulter\"&gt;Ricki-Lee Coulter&lt;/a&gt; also says that \"She has so much control and power\". &lt;a href=\"Missy%20Higgins\"&gt;Missy Higgins&lt;/a&gt; also commented that, \"Tina Arena is one of our best singers ever. She could sing the balls off anyone, and she's miniature.\" &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Mannix\"&gt;Brian Mannix&lt;/a&gt; says, \"Tina Arena has a tasteful voice. She sells the lyrics with her big voice but never over-sings.\" &lt;a href=\"Birds%20of%20Tokyo\"&gt;Birds of Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; frontman says, \"Tina Arena can sing the shit out of anything, and do it in four different languages!\" Anthony Callea added, \"Technically, she is faultless and her tone is unique and warm. I love that she goes against all the 'singers' rules'\u2014I've seen what she eats and drinks before a gig!\" Darren Hayes also made an effort in letting the public know that Arena's voice is one of his favourite voices in Australia through Twitter.\nArena records songs and albums in English, and in the French, as well as in Italian and Spanish. However, as an artist, she confirms that she does not consider recording French versions of her English-language popular hits. Arena notes that too often the intention of the song gets \"lost in translation\", therefore she has always chosen to write in both languages.\nArena's musical influences include &lt;a href=\"Barbra%20Streisand\"&gt;Barbra Streisand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carole%20King\"&gt;Carole King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dusty%20Springfield\"&gt;Dusty Springfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Petula%20Clark\"&gt;Petula Clark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aretha%20Franklin\"&gt;Aretha Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and various Italian singers. She has noted that in a non-musical perspective, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Diana\"&gt;Princess Diana&lt;/a&gt; inspired her and called her \"a great role model for women\".\nLegacy.\nArena's tracks have been covered by country music artists, including &lt;a href=\"Wynonna%20Judd\"&gt;Wynonna Judd&lt;/a&gt; (\"Heaven Help My Heart\", \"Love's Funny That Way\"), &lt;a href=\"Jo%20Dee%20Messina\"&gt;Jo Dee Messina&lt;/a&gt; (\"Burn\"), &lt;a href=\"Pam%20Tillis\"&gt;Pam Tillis&lt;/a&gt; (\"If I Didn't Love You\"), &lt;a href=\"Terri%20Clark\"&gt;Terri Clark&lt;/a&gt; (\"Unsung Hero\"), &lt;a href=\"Kellie%20Coffey\"&gt;Kellie Coffey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baillie%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Boys\"&gt;Kathie Baillie&lt;/a&gt; (\"Love's Funny That Way\") and &lt;a href=\"LeAnn%20Rimes\"&gt;LeAnn Rimes&lt;/a&gt; (\"You Made Me Find Myself\").\nYounger artists have covered Arena's songs in singing competitions, such as the winner of the second season of Australian Idol, &lt;a href=\"Casey%20Donovan%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Casey Donovan&lt;/a&gt; who recorded Arena's \"&lt;a href=\"Symphony%20of%20Life\"&gt;Symphony of Life&lt;/a&gt;\" for her album \"&lt;a href=\"For%20You%20%28Casey%20Donovan%20album%29\"&gt;For You&lt;/a&gt;\" and both Filipino artist &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Geronimo\"&gt;Sarah Geronimo&lt;/a&gt; and Australian &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Callea\"&gt;Anthony Callea&lt;/a&gt; who admits to being a fan of Arena's, recorded \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Want%20to%20Know%20What%20Love%20Is\"&gt;I Want to Know What Love Is&lt;/a&gt;\" including the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20%28music%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; that was written specifically for Arena's version. &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20De%20Bono\"&gt;Sarah De Bono&lt;/a&gt; who came in at fourth place when she joined &lt;a href=\"The%20Voice%20%28Australian%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;\"The Voice Australia\"&lt;/a&gt; also recorded Arena's \"If I Didn't Love You.\" Filipino artists &lt;a href=\"Nina%20Girado\"&gt;Nina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Bautista\"&gt;Christian Bautista&lt;/a&gt; recorded a duet version of \"&lt;a href=\"Burn%20%28Tina%20Arena%20song%29\"&gt;Burn&lt;/a&gt;\" that appeared on Nina's album \"&lt;a href=\"Nina%20Live%21\"&gt;Nina Live!&lt;/a&gt;\" while &lt;a href=\"Regine%20Velasquez\"&gt;Regine Velasquez&lt;/a&gt; did a live performance on Philippine television. &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Santos\"&gt;Erik Santos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sheryn%20Regis\"&gt;Sheryn Regis&lt;/a&gt; also recorded their version of Arena and &lt;a href=\"Marc%20Anthony\"&gt;Marc Anthony&lt;/a&gt;'s duet, \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Want%20to%20Spend%20My%20Lifetime%20Loving%20You\"&gt;I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 2001, Arena was awarded a &lt;a href=\"BMI%20Foundation\"&gt;BMI Foundation&lt;/a&gt; Songwriting Award (Broadcast Music Inc.) by the American performance rights organisation for co-writing \"Burn\" with Pam Reswick and Steve Werfel.\nIn April 2013, Arena was voted Australia's all-time greatest female singer and third greatest singer overall in an industry poll conducted by Australian music journalist, Cameron Adams, for the \"&lt;a href=\"Herald%20Sun\"&gt;Herald Sun&lt;/a&gt;\". As of July 2014, Arena has sold over 10\u00a0million records worldwide.\nIn 2015, Arena was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association\"&gt;Australian Recording Industry Association&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ARIA%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;ARIA Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; at the 2015 ARIA Awards ceremony.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Australia%20Day%20Honours\"&gt;2016 Australia Day Honours&lt;/a&gt;, Arena was appointed as a Member of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Order of Australia&lt;/a&gt; (AM) in recognition of her contribution to the arts, representing Australia on the world stage and philanthropic work.\nIn December 2020, Arena was listed at number 30 in \"Rolling Stone Australia\"s \"50 Greatest Australian Artists of All Time\" issue.\nPersonal life.\nDuring her career, Arena has resided in &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn December 1995, Arena married her then-manager, Ralph Carr, who had been her manager since 1992. The two had enjoyed considerable success, producing her 1994 album 'Don't Ask'. Their divorce was finalised in 1999, while they settled their financial and contractual matters in February 2002.\nIn the late 1990s, Arena relocated from Australia to reside in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, France. In 2000, Arena met the French artist Vincent Mancini with whom she has a son, Gabriel Joseph Mancini, born in 2005.\nIn 2012, Arena and her family relocated from Paris to reside in Melbourne, Victoria. She moved back, full-time, at the end of October 2012, after almost two decades living in France and London, with her partner, Vincent Mancini and their son. Arena says, \"It was time. I've been away 20-odd years, worked internationally and done some great things, [but] I just felt it was time to come home\". What Arena wants more than anything right now, is time with her family, including her parents, Giuseppe and Franca, and sisters Nancy and Silvana. \"I want to be with my family and have my son experience what it's like growing up in Australia\", she says, \"it's really important for me\".\nIn 2016, commenting on her balance between her artistic career and family life in Melbourne, Arena says, \"I spend my life driving my son and his mates around to play footy and soccer or just hang out.\" Arena adds that she is reaching a point in her life where she is balanced and satisfied, \"I appreciate being alive. I appreciate everything about life. I appreciate the privilege of being able to do what it is that I do. I appreciate having a beautiful family, having an extraordinary life\".\nIn 2019, Arena stated to MOZA Music, \"I've been fortunate to have been around the pre-digital world. My story's unique, I'm aware of that and don't take it for granted. How do I define success? I define it by the fact that I'm still around; and that I've managed to survive\".\nIn a September 2019 interview with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", Arena defined her approach to new technology, stating that she is not a fan of the smartphone, \"With technology I have even seen my anxiety levels rise to disproportionate levels\"\u2014yet Arena is asked to pose for them on an almost daily basis. She prefers a chat instead, \"I don't do selfies. Since I stopped doing that, I've had some of the most wonderful rapport and conversations with people that have asked me for a selfie... we are just having a fantastic human interaction. And people are amazing when you are honest with them and tell them how you feel\".\nViews.\nMusic industry politics.\nArena has been a supporter of female artists in the music industry, particularly celebrating the long-term careers of mature women artists. Arena believes we should embrace and celebrate ageing and not fall victim to &lt;a href=\"ageism\"&gt;ageism&lt;/a&gt;\u2014especially in the music industry where the maturity of women is not seen as viable or relevant.\nTo the British newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", Arena describes herself as somebody with \"certain points on the board\"\u2014someone who has been \"tenacious, resilient, hung around for a long time\" and \"done everything in their power to hone their craft\". It is from the place\u2014as one of Australia's great musical dames\u2014that she makes abrasive critiques of what constitutes a career in music today. \"I've struggled with the phantasmal aspect that has been a part of what we do\" she says. \"The fact that it has been really glamourised, glorified, also dumbed down as well.\" Thus, she argues that the music industry has been peddling shoddy wares, saying \"It's a business template they've used. They've told people that you can be a star and sold that dream to everybody. I think it's been a huge irresponsibility\".\nIn December 2016, in the \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" video series 'Her Sound, Her Story: Tina Arena', she discusses how the music industry squanders women as both they and their careers mature. \"You've got to give me a really damn good reason why somebody, who is in the prime of their career and are doing really good work, why on earth they should stop? Are you going to tell a male who is at the top of his game in whatever domain, that he needs to step down and retire?\". Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes on to talk about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. Arena says \"Get out of the ring. Take your boxing gloves off. Be convinced in the argument of your thoughts and your dreams\".\nTime's Up movement and the Australian music industry.\nIn December 2017, Arena joined over 600 high-profile female artists from the Australian music industry, including &lt;a href=\"Missy%20Higgins\"&gt;Missy Higgins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Veronicas\"&gt;the Veronicas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Blasko\"&gt;Sarah Blasko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jenny%20Morris%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Jenny Morris&lt;/a&gt;, in signing an Open letter \"#MeNoMore\" demanding change in the music industry, in support of the &lt;a href=\"Time%27s%20Up%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Time's Up&lt;/a&gt; to fight workplace sexual harassment and assault. The authors of the Open Letter state they are motivated to organise the letter as an Australian response to the &lt;a href=\"Me%20Too%20%28hashtag%29\"&gt;#MeToo campaign&lt;/a&gt; movement triggered by the accounts of sexual abuse in the wider entertainment industry. &lt;a href=\"Sony%20Music\"&gt;Sony Music&lt;/a&gt; Entertainment, &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Music%20Group\"&gt;Universal Music Group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Music%20Group\"&gt;Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt; responded with words of support.\nFollowing the January 2018 creation of US &lt;a href=\"Time%27s%20Up%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Time's Up&lt;/a&gt; campaign by a collective of Hollywood female artists to fight workplace sexual harassment and assault, Arena joined with more than 30 high-profile women from the Australian media and entertainment industries\u2014including &lt;a href=\"Deborah%20Mailman\"&gt;Deborah Mailman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Blasko\"&gt;Sarah Blasko&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Danielle%20Cormack\"&gt;Danielle Cormack&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to spearhead a new national organisation, \"NOW Australia\", led by broadcaster &lt;a href=\"Tracey%20Spicer\"&gt;Tracey Spicer&lt;/a&gt;, to tackle sexual harassment, abuse and assault in workplaces across Australia. On Twitter, the Australian &lt;a href=\"Me%20Too%20%28hashtag%29\"&gt;#MeToo campaign&lt;/a&gt; has encouraged stories of workplace harassment and assault following her public call-out on Twitter in October 2017.\nIn March 2018, in support of the \"NOW Australia\" &lt;a href=\"Time%27s%20Up%20%28organization%29\"&gt;Time's Up&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Me%20Too%20%28hashtag%29\"&gt;#MeToo campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Arena authored an &lt;a href=\"op-ed\"&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; article titled \"The music industry must join us with #thetimeisNOW\", published by &lt;a href=\"News%20Corp%20Australia\"&gt;News Corp Australia&lt;/a&gt; on news.com.au. Arena states her views on how the Australian music industry has enabled \"a stagnant perspective towards females\". Arena stated future social goals in the op-ed, that \"We need to raise the bar of our emotional intelligence because this is not a whinge, it's not a social media trend, and \"NOW Australia\" is going to keep the issue of sexual harassment at the forefront and do everything we possibly can to change the mentality that allows it to happen. We've got a lot of work to do here\".\nAnti-lockdown sentiments.\nIn September 2021, Arena appeared on Australian daytime television program Studio 10 to highlight the disparity between the art community and sporting events in relation to COVID-19. During this interview, she advocated that the arts sector should no longer support charitable causes and that Victorian lockdowns should be ended. The comments drew criticism for what many saw as an undermining of public health orders and a disregard for the medics working under an already strained healthcare system.\nMemoir.\nArena's memoir, \"&lt;a href=\"Now%20I%20Can%20Dance%20%28book%29\"&gt;Now I Can Dance&lt;/a&gt;\", published by &lt;a href=\"HarperCollins\"&gt;HarperCollins&lt;/a&gt;, was released on 14 October 2013, in hardback, paperback and E-book format. Arena authoured her memoir with co-writer Jude McGee.
