    "text": "The 1946\u201347 Penn State Nittany Lions men's ice hockey season was the 6th season of play for the program. The Nittany Lions represented &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20State%20University\"&gt;Pennsylvania State University&lt;/a&gt; and were coached by &lt;a href=\"James%20O%27Hora\"&gt;James O'Hora&lt;/a&gt; in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter the end of the war, many of the players on previous teams returned to campus. Penn State restarted its ice hockey program in 1946 and arranged a few games but the problems that had plagued the team before had not been resolved. The program still didn't have a home building and the cost of travelling for all of its games was a burden. On top of that, despite having veteran players, the team wasn't competitive in any of its games. After the year the school made the only choice it had a discontinued the varsity program. It would later resurface as a club team in the early 1970s and eventually return to varsity status in &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20season\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"
