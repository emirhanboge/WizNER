    "text": "The Robotron KC 87, fully known as the Kleincomputer robotron KC 87 (\"KC\" standing for \"Kleincomputer\", lit. \"small computer\"), was an &lt;a href=\"8-bit\"&gt;8-bit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"home%20computer\"&gt;home computer&lt;/a&gt; released in 1987 and produced in &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Volkseigener%20Betrieb\"&gt;VEB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"VEB%20Robotron\"&gt;Robotron&lt;/a&gt;-Me\u00dfelektronik \"Otto Sch\u00f6n\" &lt;a href=\"Dresden\"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"Combine%20%28enterprise%29\"&gt;Kombinat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"VEB%20Robotron\"&gt;Robotron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first model in the series, the Robotron Z 9001, was introduced in 1984 and renamed Robotron KC 85/1 in 1985. Despite similar names, the Robotron home computers were not directly related to the &lt;a href=\"KC%2085\"&gt;KC 85&lt;/a&gt; series produced by the &lt;a href=\"Kombinat%20Mikroelektronik%20Erfurt\"&gt;VEB Mikroelektronik&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Pieck\"&gt;Wilhelm Pieck&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BChlhausen\"&gt;M\u00fchlhausen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe availability of the Robotron KC series for private customers was very limited. The computers were mostly used at educational institutions, organizations, and enterprises. Therefore, the &lt;a href=\"Extracurricular%20activity\"&gt;extracurricular&lt;/a&gt; use of home computers was often allowed for students at institutions and organizations.\nDesign.\nThe Robotron KC series used an &lt;a href=\"U880\"&gt;U880&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"microprocessor\"&gt;microprocessor&lt;/a&gt;, a clone of the &lt;a href=\"Zilog%20Z80\"&gt;Zilog Z80&lt;/a&gt;, which was clocked at 2.5\u00a0MHz. The keyboard was integrated into every machine. Software could be loaded from &lt;a href=\"cassette%20tape\"&gt;cassette tape&lt;/a&gt;s; a separate &lt;a href=\"cassette%20deck\"&gt;cassette deck&lt;/a&gt; was needed for doing so. All models featured module slots for up to four expansion modules, which allowed expansion of the hardware, such as by upgrading the &lt;a href=\"Random-access%20memory\"&gt;RAM&lt;/a&gt; or allowing it to connect to a &lt;a href=\"printer%20%28computing%29\"&gt;printer&lt;/a&gt;, but also included &lt;a href=\"application%20software\"&gt;applications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"programming%20language\"&gt;programming language&lt;/a&gt;s. The KC 87 had the &lt;a href=\"BASIC\"&gt;BASIC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Interpreter%20%28computing%29\"&gt;interpreter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Read-only%20memory\"&gt;ROM&lt;/a&gt;, (in earlier models, the user had to load it from tape or use a BASIC expansion module). In addition to the home computers, Robotron also offered cassette tapes with applications and &lt;a href=\"video%20game\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;, modules, and other equipment. "
