    "text": "Hj\u00f6rdis Gunborg Schymberg (April 24, 1909 \u2013 September 8, 2008) was a Swedish &lt;a href=\"Coloratura%20soprano\"&gt;coloratura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lyric%20soprano\"&gt;lyric soprano&lt;/a&gt; active on the &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; stage and in concert halls between 1934 and 1968. One of the leading singers of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swedish%20Opera\"&gt;Royal Swedish Opera&lt;/a&gt;, she was awarded the title of \"&lt;a href=\"Hovs%C3%A5ngare\"&gt;Hovs\u00e5ngerska&lt;/a&gt;\" (Court Singer) in 1943, and in her later years became a distinguished &lt;a href=\"Vocal%20pedagogy\"&gt;voice teacher&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nHj\u00f6rdis Schymberg was born on the island of &lt;a href=\"Aln%C3%B6n\"&gt;Aln\u00f6n&lt;/a&gt; on April 24, 1909, the fourth of five musically talented sisters. Her father worked in the local lumber mill and her mother was a seamstress. As a child, she played both the violin and piano and sang with the &lt;a href=\"Gustavsberg%2C%20Sundsvall\"&gt;Gustavsberg&lt;/a&gt; children's orchestra. She and her sisters also sang in cafes and performed music to accompany &lt;a href=\"silent%20film\"&gt;silent film&lt;/a&gt;s. At the age of 16, she had her own radio program, \"Tant Hj\u00f6rdis sjunger med barnen\" (Aunt Hj\u00f6rdis sings with children), but it was not until 1929 that she began formal vocal training with Brita von Vegesack. Three years later, she went to &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; where she studied under &lt;a href=\"John%20Forsell\"&gt;John Forsell&lt;/a&gt;, who was also the teacher of &lt;a href=\"Jussi%20Bj%C3%B6rling\"&gt;Jussi Bj\u00f6rling&lt;/a&gt;. Schymberg and Bjorling were to sing together later, including a highly celebrated rendition of \"&lt;a href=\"O%20soave%20fanciulla\"&gt;O soave fanciulla&lt;/a&gt;\", recorded in 1941. A scholarship gave her the opportunity for further study in Italy under Renato Bellini and &lt;a href=\"Lina%20Pagliughi\"&gt;Lina Pagliughi&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe made her stage debut in 1934 as Berthe in a matin\u00e9e performance of &lt;a href=\"Adolphe%20Adam\"&gt;Adolphe Adam&lt;/a&gt;'s comic opera \"&lt;a href=\"La%20poup%C3%A9e%20de%20Nuremberg\"&gt;La poup\u00e9e de Nuremberg&lt;/a&gt;\". Later that year she sang Mim\u00ec to Bj\u00f6rling's Rodolfo for their 1934 role debuts in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20boh%C3%A8me\"&gt;La boh\u00e8me&lt;/a&gt;\" and went on to sing with him over 100 times, including his last performance in Stockholm in 1960. She soon became one of the leading sopranos of the Royal Swedish Opera and also sang regularly in &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;. She created the title role in &lt;a href=\"Lars-Erik%20Larsson\"&gt;Larsson&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Princess%20of%20Cyprus\"&gt;The Princess of Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1937.\nHowever, her international career was delayed by &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. Her first major engagement outside Scandinavia came in 1946 when she was scheduled to appear in London's &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Albert%20Hall\"&gt;Royal Albert Hall&lt;/a&gt; in a concert of arias by &lt;a href=\"George%20Frideric%20Handel\"&gt;Handel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart\"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Berwald\"&gt;Berwald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9o%20Delibes\"&gt;Delibes&lt;/a&gt;, conducted by &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Ansermet\"&gt;Ernest Ansermet&lt;/a&gt;. Schymberg's American debut came in 1947 when she sang Susanna in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro\"&gt;Le nozze di Figaro&lt;/a&gt;\" at New York's &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt;. The manager Edvard Johnson had heard her already back in 1938 and wanted her to appear at the Metropolitan. She was given a contract for the following season after her debut in 1947 but she never returned to the Metropolitan. She also appeared there in the same season as Gilda in \"&lt;a href=\"Rigoletto\"&gt;Rigoletto&lt;/a&gt;\". A review of her Met debut in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" described her:\nComely, petite and graceful, she was an ideal Susanna to the eye. Her impersonation was refined and filled with the spirit of youth. She brought the needed vivacity and sly humor to her interpretation and gave it real human appeal in a natural and unaffected way that won immediate favor with the large audience.\nShe went on to give a series of concerts in the United States in 1947 and also appeared in &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Riccione\"&gt;Riccione&lt;/a&gt; later on where she sang in \"Rigoletto\" opposite &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Di%20Stefano\"&gt;Giuseppe Di Stefano&lt;/a&gt; as the Duke of Mantua. Her &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt; debut came in 1951 as Violetta in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20traviata\"&gt;La traviata&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSchymberg retired from the Royal Swedish Opera company in 1959, but continued to perform in operas, concerts, &lt;a href=\"art%20song\"&gt;art song&lt;/a&gt; recitals and recordings until 1968 when she gave her farewell performance at the Royal Swedish Opera. In her later years she taught singing at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20College%20of%20Music%2C%20Stockholm\"&gt;Royal College of Music&lt;/a&gt; in Stockholm. Amongst her pupils were several prominent Scandinavian opera singers including &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6sta%20Winbergh\"&gt;G\u00f6sta Winbergh&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvia Lindenstrand, Laila Andersson-Palme, and &lt;a href=\"Solveig%20Kringlebotn\"&gt;Solveig Kringelborn&lt;/a&gt;. In 1997 she donated Schymbergsg\u00e5rden, her childhood home in Aln\u00f6n, to the Schymbergsg\u00e5rden Foundation which she established for the benefit of young singers and musicians. Schymbergsg\u00e5rden is now a venue for summer concerts and &lt;a href=\"master%20class\"&gt;master class&lt;/a&gt;es.\nSchymberg died in Stockholm in the early hours of September 8, 2008, at the age of 99.\nThe Hj\u00f6rdis Schymberg Foundation has announced its first singing competition, open to young professionals, with the final stage planned for &lt;a href=\"Sundsvall\"&gt;Sundsvall&lt;/a&gt; in October 2018.\nRepertoire.\nSchymberg's signature role was Violetta in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20traviata\"&gt;La traviata&lt;/a&gt;\", which she sang over 140 times between 1939 and 1968. The &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; also filmed her in costume singing arias from the opera for a 1951 episode of \"&lt;a href=\"Picture%20Page\"&gt;Picture Page&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1945 she sang Zephyr in the premiere of Rosenberg's opera \"&lt;a href=\"Lycksalighetens%20%C3%B6\"&gt;Lycksalighetens \u00f6&lt;/a&gt;\". Over the course of her career she sang over 50 other roles including:\nRecordings.\nIn 1975 the Unique Opera Records Corporation released on &lt;a href=\"LP%20album\"&gt;LP&lt;/a&gt; the complete live recording of \"La traviata\" performed at the Swedish Royal Opera on 29 August 1939 with Schymberg as Violetta and &lt;a href=\"Jussi%20Bj%C3%B6rling\"&gt;Jussi Bj\u00f6rling&lt;/a&gt; as Alfredo in his last assumption of the role. Excerpts from that recording can still be found in some CD compilations such as \"The Jussi Bj\u00f6rling Series \u2013 Radam\u00e8s, Alfredo, Rom\u00e9o\" (Bluebell ABCD 103). Other CD recordings featuring Schymberg include:"
