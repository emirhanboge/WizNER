He began his writing career at age 15 as a local reporter for the \"Westf\u00e4lische Rundschau\". As a student he published in German national newspapers; from 1996 to 2000 he was a regular contributor to the cultural section of \"&lt;a href=\"Frankfurter%20Allgemeine%20Zeitung\"&gt;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;\".

There was controversy over Kermani's nomination as one of the three winners because of an essay in which Kermani had written about his feelings on seeing a painting of the crucifixion by the seventeenth-century Italian painter &lt;a href=\"Guido%20Reni\"&gt;Guido Reni&lt;/a&gt;. The issue was ultimately resolved, and Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Lehmann\"&gt;Karl Lehmann&lt;/a&gt;, , Kermani, and &lt;a href=\"Salomon%20Korn\"&gt;Salomon Korn&lt;/a&gt; jointly received the prize on 26 November 2009. Kermani donated his share of the award to a Christian priest.\nPersonal life.\nKermani holds German and Iranian citizenship.
