    "title": "Economy of Nigeria",
    "text": "The economy of &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; is a middle-income, &lt;a href=\"mixed%20economy\"&gt;mixed economy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"emerging%20market\"&gt;emerging market&lt;/a&gt;, with expanding manufacturing, financial, service, communications, technology and entertainment sectors. It is ranked as the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28nominal%29\"&gt;27th-largest economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28PPP%29\"&gt;24th-largest in terms of purchasing power parity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; has the largest economy in Africa. The country's re-emergent manufacturing sector became the largest on the continent in 2013, and it produces a large proportion of goods and services for the region of &lt;a href=\"West%20Africa\"&gt;West Africa&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"debt-to-GDP%20ratio\"&gt;debt-to-GDP ratio&lt;/a&gt; was 16.075% as of 2019.\nNigerian GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) has almost tripled from $170 billion in 2000 to $451 billion in 2012, though estimates of the size of the &lt;a href=\"informal%20sector\"&gt;informal sector&lt;/a&gt; (which is not included in official figures) put the actual numbers closer to $630 billion. Subsequently, the GDP per capita doubled from $1400 per person in 2000 to an estimated $2,800 per person in 2012. Again, with the inclusion of the informal sector, it is estimated that GDP per capita hovers around $3,900 per person. The country's population increased from 120 million in 2000 to 160 million in 2010. The GDP figures were to be revised upwards by as much as 80% (percent) when metrics were to be recalculated subsequent to the rebasing of its economy in April 2014.\nAlthough oil revenues contributed 2/3 of state revenues, oil only contributes about 9% to the GDP. &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; produces only about 2.7%(percent) of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20oil%20production\"&gt;world's oil supply&lt;/a&gt;. Although the petroleum sector is important, as &lt;a href=\"government\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; revenues still heavily rely on this sector, it remains a small part of the country's overall economy.\nThe largely subsistence agricultural sector has not kept up with the country's rapid population growth. Nigeria was once a large net exporter of food, but currently imports some of its food products. Mechanization has led to a resurgence in the manufacturing and exporting of food products, and there was consequently a move towards food sufficiency. In 2006, Nigeria came to an agreement with the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Club\"&gt;Paris Club&lt;/a&gt; to buy back the bulk of its owed debts from them, in exchange for a cash payment of roughly US$12 billion.\nAccording to a &lt;a href=\"Citigroup\"&gt;Citigroup&lt;/a&gt; report published in February 2011, Nigeria would have the highest average GDP growth in the world between 2010 and 2050. Nigeria is one of two countries from Africa among the 11 &lt;a href=\"3G%20%28countries%29\"&gt;Global Growth Generators&lt;/a&gt; countries.\nOverview.\nIn 2014, &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; changed its economic analysis to account for fast growing contributors to its GDP, such as telecommunications, banking, and its film industry.\nIn 2005, &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; reached an agreement with the Paris Club of lending nations to eliminate all of its bilateral external debt. Under the agreement, the lenders will forgive most of the debt, and Nigeria will pay off the remainder with a portion of its energy revenues. Moreover, human capital is underdeveloped\u2014Nigeria ranked 161 out of 189 countries in the United Nations Development Index in 2019\u2014and non-energy-related infrastructure is inadequate.\nFrom 2003 to 2007, Nigeria attempted to implement an economic reform program called the &lt;a href=\"National%20Economic%20Empowerment%20Development%20Strategy\"&gt;National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (NEEDS). The purpose of the NEEDS was to raise the country's &lt;a href=\"standard%20of%20living\"&gt;standard of living&lt;/a&gt; through a variety of reforms, including macroeconomic stability, &lt;a href=\"deregulation\"&gt;deregulation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"liberalization\"&gt;liberalization&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"privatization\"&gt;privatization&lt;/a&gt;, transparency, and accountability.\nThe NEEDS addressed basic deficiencies, such as the lack of freshwater for household use and irrigation, unreliable power supplies, decaying infrastructure, hindrance to private enterprise, and corruption. NEEDS was intended to create 7 million new jobs, diversify the economy, boost non-energy exports, increase industrial capacity utilization, and improve agricultural productivity. A related initiative on the state level is the State Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (SEEDS).\nA longer-term economic development program is the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.un.org/en/\"&gt;United Nations (UN)-&lt;/a&gt; sponsored National &lt;a href=\"Millennium%20Goals\"&gt;Millennium Goals&lt;/a&gt; for Nigeria. Under the program, which covers the years from 2000 to 2015, Nigeria is committed to achieving a wide range of ambitious objectives involving poverty reduction, education, gender equality, health, the environment, and international development cooperation. In an update released in 2004, the UN found that Nigeria was making progress toward achieving several goals but was falling short on others.\nSpecifically, Nigeria had advanced efforts to provide universal primary education, protect the environment.\nA requirements for achieving many of these worthwhile objectives is reducing endemic corruption, which obstruct development and stain Nigeria's business environment. President &lt;a href=\"Olusegun%20Obasanjo\"&gt;Olusegun Obasanjo&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign against corruption, which includes the arrest of officials accused of misdeeds and recovering stolen funds, has won praise from the &lt;a href=\"World%20Bank\"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;. In September 2005, Nigeria, with the &lt;a href=\"Nigeria%20and%20the%20World%20Bank\"&gt;assistance of the World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, began to recover US$458 million of illicit funds that had been deposited in Swiss banks by the late military dictator Sani Abacha, who ruled Nigeria from 1993 to 1998. However, while broad-based progress has been slow, these efforts have begun to become visible in international surveys of corruption. Nigeria's ranking has consistently improved since 2001 ranking 147 out of 180 countries in &lt;a href=\"Transparency%20International\"&gt;Transparency International&lt;/a&gt;'s 2007 &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Perceptions%20Index\"&gt;Corruption Perceptions Index&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nigerian economy suffers from an ongoing &lt;a href=\"Nigerian%20energy%20supply%20crisis\"&gt;supply crisis in the power sector&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a rapidly growing economy, some of the world's &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20proven%20oil%20reserves\"&gt;largest deposits of coal, oil and gas&lt;/a&gt; and the country's status as Africa's largest oil producer, power supply difficulties are frequently experienced by residents.\nTwo thirds of Nigerians expect living conditions to improve in the coming decades.\nEconomic history.\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Nigeria at market prices estimated by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Monetary%20Fund\"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; with figures in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20dollar\"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt; billions. Figures before 2000 are backwards projections from the 2000\u20132012 numbers, based on historical growth rates, and should be replaced when data becomes available. The figure for 2014 is derived from a rebasing of economical activity earlier in the year.\nNOTES:\nThe US dollar exchange rate is an estimated average of the official rate throughout a year, and does not reflect the parallel market rate at which the general population accesses foreign exchange. This rate ranged from a high of 520 in March 2017 to a low of 350 in August 2017, due to a scarcity of forex (oil earnings had dropped by half), and to speculative activity as alleged by the Central Bank. All the while the official rate was pegged at 360.\nPer capita income (as % of USA) is calculated using data from estimates in the PPP link above, and from census estimates, based on growth rates between census periods. For instance, 2017 GDPs were 1,125 billion (Nigeria) vs. 19,417 billion (USA) and populations were estimated at 320 million vs 190 million. The ratio is therefore (1125/19417) / (190/320), which roughly comes to 0.0975. These are estimates and are intended to get a feel for the relative wealth and standard of living, as well as the market potential of its middle class.\nThis is a chart of trend of the global ranking of the Nigerian economy, in comparison with other countries of the world, derived from the historical &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28PPP%29\"&gt;List of countries by GDP (PPP)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis chart shows the variance in the parallel exchange rate at which the Dollar can be obtained with Naira in Lagos, with \"Best\" being cheaper for a Nigerian (i.e. stronger Naira).\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at US$1 to 314.27 &lt;a href=\"Nigerian%20naira\"&gt;Nigerian naira&lt;/a&gt; (as of 2017).\nCurrent GDP per capita of Nigeria expanded 132% in the sixties reaching a peak growth of 283% in the seventies. But this proved unsustainable and it consequently shrank by 66% in the 1980s. In the 1990s, diversification initiatives finally took effect and decadal growth was restored to 10%. Although GDP on a PPP basis did not increase until the 2000s.\nIn 2012, the GDP was composed of the following sectors: agriculture: 40%; services: 30%; manufacturing: 15%; oil: 14%. By 2015, the GDP was composed of the following sectors: agriculture: 18%; services: 55%; manufacturing: 16%; oil: 8%\nIn 2005 Nigeria's &lt;a href=\"inflation\"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt; rate was an estimated 15.6%. Nigeria's goal under the National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS) program is to reduce inflation to the single digits. By 2015, Nigeria's inflation stood at 9%. In 2005, the federal government had expenditures of US$13.54 billion but revenues of only US$12.86 billion, resulting in a budget deficit of 5%. By 2012, expenditures stood at $31.61 billion, while revenues was $54.48 billion.\nEconomic sectors.\nAgriculture.\nNigeria &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20agricultural%20output\"&gt;ranks sixth&lt;/a&gt; worldwide and first in &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; in farm output. The sector accounts for about 18% of GDP and almost one-third of employment. Nigeria has 19 million head of cattle, the largest in Africa. Though Nigeria is no longer a major exporter, due to local consumer boom, it is still a major producer of many agricultural products, including: &lt;a href=\"Theobroma%20cacao\"&gt;cocoa&lt;/a&gt;, groundnuts (peanuts), &lt;a href=\"Natural%20rubber\"&gt;rubber&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"palm%20oil\"&gt;palm oil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cocoa%20bean\"&gt;Cocoa&lt;/a&gt; production, mostly from obsolete varieties and overage trees has increased from around 180,000 tons annually to 350,000 tons.\nMajor agricultural products include &lt;a href=\"Cassava%20production%20in%20Nigeria\"&gt;cassava&lt;/a&gt; (tapioca), &lt;a href=\"Maize\"&gt;corn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cocoa%20bean\"&gt;cocoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"millet\"&gt;millet&lt;/a&gt;, palm oil, peanuts, rice, &lt;a href=\"Natural%20rubber\"&gt;rubber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sorghum\"&gt;sorghum&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"yam%20%28vegetable%29\"&gt;yam&lt;/a&gt;s. In 2003, livestock production, in order of metric tonnage, featured eggs, milk, beef and veal, poultry, and pork, respectively. In the same year, the total fishing catch was 505.8 metric tons. Roundwood removals totaled slightly less than 70 million cubic meters, and sawnwood production was estimated at 2 million cubic meters. The agricultural sector suffers from extremely low productivity, reflecting reliance on antiquated methods. Agriculture has failed to keep pace with Nigeria's rapid population growth, so that the country, which once exported food, now imports a significant amount of food to sustain itself. However, efforts are being made towards making the country food sufficient again.\nNigeria produced in 2018:\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.\nOil.\nNigeria's proven &lt;a href=\"oil%20reserves\"&gt;oil reserves&lt;/a&gt; are estimated to be ; natural gas reserves are well over . Nigeria is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Organization%20of%20Petroleum%20Exporting%20Countries\"&gt;Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&lt;/a&gt; (OPEC). The types of &lt;a href=\"crude%20oil\"&gt;crude oil&lt;/a&gt; exported by Nigeria are &lt;a href=\"Bonny%20light%20oil\"&gt;Bonny light oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forcados%20crude%20oil\"&gt;Forcados crude oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qua%20Ibo%20crude%20oil\"&gt;Qua Ibo crude oil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brass%20River%20crude%20oil\"&gt;Brass River crude oil&lt;/a&gt;. Poor corporate relations with indigenous communities, vandalism of oil infrastructure, severe ecological damage, and personal security problems throughout the &lt;a href=\"Niger%20Delta\"&gt;Niger Delta&lt;/a&gt; oil-producing region continue to plague Nigeria's oil sector.\nEfforts are underway to reverse these troubles. A new entity, the &lt;a href=\"Niger%20Delta%20Development%20Commission\"&gt;Niger Delta Development Commission&lt;/a&gt; (NDDC), has been created to help catalyze economic and social development in the region. The U.S. remains Nigeria's largest buyer of crude oil, accounting for 40% of the country's total oil exports; Nigeria provides about 10% of overall U.S. oil imports and ranks as the fifth-largest source for U.S. imported oil.\nThe United Kingdom is Nigeria's largest trading partner followed by the United States. Although the trade balance overwhelmingly favors Nigeria, thanks to oil exports, a large portion of U.S. exports to Nigeria is believed to enter the country outside of the Nigerian government's official statistics, due to importers seeking to avoid Nigeria's tariffs. To counter smuggling and under-invoicing by importers, in May 2001, the Nigerian government instituted a full inspection program for all imports, and enforcement has been sustained.\nOn the whole, Nigerian high tariffs and non-tariff barriers are gradually being reduced, but much progress remains to be made. The government also has been encouraging the expansion of &lt;a href=\"foreign%20direct%20investment\"&gt;foreign investment&lt;/a&gt;, although the country's investment climate remains daunting to all but the most determined. The stock of U.S. investment is nearly $7 billion, mostly in the energy sector. &lt;a href=\"ExxonMobil\"&gt;ExxonMobil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chevron%20Corporation\"&gt;Chevron&lt;/a&gt; are the two largest U.S. corporations in offshore oil and gas production. Significant exports of liquefied natural gas started in late 1999 and are slated to expand as Nigeria seeks to eliminate gas flaring by 2008.\nThe pump price of P.M.S. as at 14 May 2020 stands at around \u20a6123.500 at fueling stations across Nigeria. An initial increase in the price of petrol (Premium Motor Spirit) from around \u20a665 to \u20a6140 triggered by the removal of fuel subsidies on 1 January 2012, triggered a total strike and massive protests across the country. Then President &lt;a href=\"Goodluck%20Ebele%20Jonathan\"&gt;Goodluck Ebele Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; later reached an agreement with the &lt;a href=\"Nigerian%20Labour%20Congress\"&gt;Nigerian Labour Congress&lt;/a&gt; and reduced the pump price to 97 naira. The pump price was further reduced by 10 to 87 naira in the run-up to the 2015 general elections. However, after the elections of &lt;a href=\"Muhammadu%20Buhari\"&gt;Muhammadu Buhari&lt;/a&gt;, the fuel subsidies was removed again, and the pump price increased again, despite the fall in oil price.\nSince the fall in oil prices in 2015 and 2016, the government exchange rate policy has limited devaluation of the naira due to inflation concerns by the President Muhammadu Buhari.\nServices.\nNigeria &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20sector%20composition\"&gt;ranks 27th&lt;/a&gt; worldwide and first in Africa in services' output.\nSince undergoing severe distress in the mid-1990s, Nigeria's banking sector has witnessed significant growth over the last few years as new banks enter the financial market.\nPrivate sector-led economic growth remains stymied by the high cost of doing business in Nigeria, including the need to duplicate essential infrastructure, the lack of effective due process, and nontransparent economic decision making, especially in government contracting. While corrupt practices are endemic, they are generally less flagrant than during military rule, and there are signs of improvement. In 2013, The World Bank in 2013 stated that since 1999, the Nigerian Stock Exchange has enjoyed strong performance, although equity as a means to foster corporate growth is being more utilized by Nigeria's private sector.\nTransport.\nPrincipal ports are at &lt;a href=\"Lagos\"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Apapa\"&gt;Apapa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tin%20Can%20Island\"&gt;Tin Can Island&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Port%20Harcourt\"&gt;Port Harcourt&lt;/a&gt; (Onne), and &lt;a href=\"Calabar\"&gt;Calabar&lt;/a&gt;.\nExtensive road repairs and new construction activities are gradually being implemented as state governments, in particular, spend their portions of enhanced government revenue allocations.\nFive of Nigeria's airports (Lagos, &lt;a href=\"Kano%20%28city%29\"&gt;Kano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Port%20Harcourt\"&gt;Port Harcourt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enugu\"&gt;Enugu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abuja\"&gt;Abuja&lt;/a&gt;) currently fly to international destinations. The &lt;a href=\"Nigerian%20Airforce\"&gt;Nigerian Airforce&lt;/a&gt; began a new airline called United Nigeria, with a &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20737-500\"&gt;Boeing 737-500&lt;/a&gt; in 2013. There are several domestic private Nigerian carriers, and air service among Nigeria's cities is generally dependable.\nEnergy.\nData.\nElectricity \u2013 production:\n18.89 billion kWh (2009)\nElectricity \u2013 production by source:\n\"fossil fuel:\"\n61.69%\n\"hydro:\"\n38.31%\n\"nuclear:\"\n0%\n\"other:\"\n&lt;.1% (1998)\nElectricity - consumption:\n17.66 billion kWh (2009)\nElectricity - exports:\n40 million kWh (2003)\nElectricity - imports:\n0 kWh (1998)\nOil - production: \n (July 2006 est.)\nOil - consumption:\n (2003 est.)\nOverseas remittances.\nA major source of foreign exchange earnings for Nigeria are &lt;a href=\"remittances\"&gt;remittances&lt;/a&gt; sent home by Nigerians living abroad. In 2014, 17.5 million Nigerians lived in foreign countries, with the UK and the USA having more than 2 million Nigerians each.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Organization%20for%20Migration\"&gt;International Organization for Migration&lt;/a&gt;, Nigeria witnessed a dramatic increase in &lt;a href=\"remittances\"&gt;remittances&lt;/a&gt; sent home from overseas Nigerians, going from US$2.3 billion in 2004 to $17.9 billion in 2007, representing 6.7% of GDP. The United States accounts for the largest portion of official remittances, followed by the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Spain and France. On the African continent, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Libya and South Africa are important source countries of remittance flows to Nigeria, while China is the biggest remittance-sending country in Asia.\nLabour force.\nIn 2015, Nigeria had a labour force of 74 million. In 2003, the unemployment rate was 10.8% overall; by 2015, unemployment stood at 6.4%.\nSince 1999, the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) a union umbrella organization, has called six general strikes to protest domestic fuel price increases. However, in March 2005 the government introduced legislation ending the NLC's monopoly over union organizing. In December 2005, the &lt;a href=\"Nigeria%20Labour%20Congress\"&gt;Nigerian Labour Congress&lt;/a&gt; (NLC) was lobbying for an increase in the minimum wage for federal workers. The existing minimum wage, which was introduced six years earlier but has not been adjusted since, has been whittled away by inflation to only US$42.80 per month.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Organization%20for%20Migration\"&gt;International Organization for Migration&lt;/a&gt;, the number of &lt;a href=\"immigrants\"&gt;immigrants&lt;/a&gt; residing in Nigeria has more than doubled in recent decades \u2013 from 477,135 in 1991 to 971,450 in 2005. The majority of immigrants in Nigeria (74%) are from neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Economic%20Community%20of%20West%20African%20States\"&gt;Economic Community of West African States&lt;/a&gt; (ECOWAS), and that this number has increased considerably over the last decade, from 63% in 2001 to 97% in 2005.\nThe government has to pay a high interest rate on bonds in part because of the high fertility rate; there are many children and less savings.\nHuman capital.\nAs of 2019, Nigeria's &lt;a href=\"Human%20Development%20Index\"&gt;HDI&lt;/a&gt; (Human Development Index) is ranked 161st at 0.539. The comparative value for &lt;a href=\"Sub-Saharan%20Africa\"&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt; is 0.547, 0.926 for the US, and 0.737 for the world average.\nThe value for the education index is 0.499, compared to the average in the US of 0.900. The expected years of schooling in Nigeria is 10.0 (16.3 in the US), while the mean years of schooling for adults over 25 years is 6.7 years (13.4 years in the US). Additionally, Nigeria is also facing a relatively high inequality, worsening the problem regarding the formation of human capital.\nGovernment policy.\nInflation.\nIn 2016, the black market exchange rate of the Naira was about 60% above the official rate. The central bank releases about $200 million each week at the official exchange rate. However, some companies cite that budgets now include a 30% \"premium\" to be paid to central bank officials to get dollars.\nNigeria\u2019s inflation rate rose to 15.63 per cent in December 2021 compared to 15.40 per cent in November, the National Bureau of Statistics announced on January 17th, 2022. The statistics office said the prices of goods and services, measured by the Consumer Price Index, increased by 15.63 per cent in December 2021 when compared to December 2020. According to the NBS, this rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of bread and cereals, food products, meat, fish, potatoes, yam and other tubers, soft drinks and fruits.\nForeign economic relations.\nNigeria's foreign economic relations revolve around its role in supplying the world economy with oil and natural gas, even as the country seeks to diversify its exports, harmonize tariffs in line with a potential &lt;a href=\"customs%20union\"&gt;customs union&lt;/a&gt; sought by the &lt;a href=\"Economic%20Community%20of%20West%20African%20States\"&gt;Economic Community of West African States&lt;/a&gt; (ECOWAS), and encourage inflows of foreign portfolio and direct investment. In October 2005, Nigeria implemented the ECOWAS &lt;a href=\"common%20external%20tariff\"&gt;common external tariff&lt;/a&gt;, which reduced the number of tariff bands.\nPrior to this revision, tariffs constituted Nigeria's second largest source of revenue after oil exports. In 2005 Nigeria achieved a major breakthrough when it reached an agreement with the Paris Club to eliminate its bilateral debt through a combination of write-downs and buybacks. Nigeria joined the &lt;a href=\"Organization%20of%20the%20Petroleum%20Exporting%20Countries\"&gt;Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries&lt;/a&gt; in July 1971 and the &lt;a href=\"World%20Trade%20Organization\"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt; in January 1995.\nIf the global transition to renewable energy is completed and international demand for Nigeria's petroleum resources ceases, Nigeria will be significantly weakened. It is ranked 149 out of 156 countries in the index of Geopolitical Gains and Losses after energy transition (GeGaLo).\nExternal trade.\nIn 2017, Nigeria imported about US$34.2 billion of goods. In 2017 the leading sources of imports were China (28%), the Belgium-Luxembourg (8.9%), the Netherlands (8.3%), South Korea (6.4%), the United States (6.0%) and the India (4.6%). Principal imports were manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, and food and live animals.\nIn 2017, Nigeria exported about US$46.68 billion of goods. In 2017, the leading destinations for exports were India (18%), the United States (14%), Spain (9.7%), France (6.0%) and the Netherlands (4.9%). In 2017 oil accounted for 83% of merchandise exports. Natural rubber and cocoa are the country's major agricultural exports.\nIn 2005, Nigeria posted a US$26 billion trade surplus, corresponding to almost 20% of gross domestic product. In 2005, Nigeria achieved a positive current account balance of US$9.6 billion. The Nigerian currency is the &lt;a href=\"naira\"&gt;naira&lt;/a&gt; (NGN). As of June 2006, the &lt;a href=\"exchange%20rate\"&gt;exchange rate&lt;/a&gt; was about US$1=NGN128.4. As of June 2019, it stands at US$1 =NGN357. In recent years, Nigeria has expanded its trade relations with other developing countries such as India. Nigeria is the largest African crude oil supplier to India \u2013 it annually exports to India valued at US$10 billion annually.\nIndia is the largest purchaser of Nigeria's oil which fulfills 20% to 25% of India's domestic oil demand. Indian oil companies are also involved in oil drilling operations in Nigeria and have plans to set up refineries there.\nThe trade volume between Nigeria and the United Kingdom rose by 35% from &lt;a href=\"USD\"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;6.3 billion in 2010 to &lt;a href=\"USD\"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;8.5 billion in 2011.\nExternal debt.\nIn 2012, Nigeria's external debt was an estimated $5.9 billion and N5.6 trillion domestic - putting total debt at $44 billion.\nIn April 2006, Nigeria became the first African country to fully pay off its debt owed to the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Club\"&gt;Paris Club&lt;/a&gt;.
