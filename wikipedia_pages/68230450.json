It was pretty good to be part of the team; I have some mates, we all came from New Zealand and the goal was for them to play Cup this year.\"\nAfter playing the first 4 games with Wynnum in 2021, Pauga was released to join the Wests Tigers in the NRL.\n2021.\nPauga made his debut in round 18, for the Wests Tigers against the &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20Broncos\"&gt;Brisbane Broncos&lt;/a&gt;, scoring a try in a 42-24 victory. Before the game, he said, \"It\u2019s been a tough journey over the past three years. After leaving the Warriors, I didn\u2019t have anything and had to go to Queensland to start all over again. When this opportunity came up, I had no doubt in my mind that I was going to take it with both hands and I don\u2019t ever want to take it for granted.\""
