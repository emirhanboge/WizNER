    "text": "Kirby's Dream Land, known in Japan as is a 1992 &lt;a href=\"platform%20game\"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; video game developed by &lt;a href=\"HAL%20Laboratory\"&gt;HAL Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; and published by &lt;a href=\"Nintendo\"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy\"&gt;Game Boy&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first game in the &lt;a href=\"Kirby%20%28series%29\"&gt;\"Kirby\" series&lt;/a&gt; marks the debut of &lt;a href=\"Kirby%20%28character%29\"&gt;Kirby&lt;/a&gt;. It introduced many conventions that would appear in later games in the series.\n\"Kirby's Dream Land\" was designed by &lt;a href=\"Masahiro%20Sakurai\"&gt;Masahiro Sakurai&lt;/a&gt;, who intended it to be a simple game that could be easy to pick up and play by those unfamiliar with &lt;a href=\"action%20game\"&gt;action game&lt;/a&gt;s. For more advanced players, he offered additional optional challenges such as an unlockable hard mode and the ability to edit Kirby's maximum &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28gaming%29\"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; and starting number of &lt;a href=\"Life%20%28gaming%29\"&gt;lives&lt;/a&gt;. \"Kirby's Dream Land\" was re-released on the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%203DS\"&gt;Nintendo 3DS&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Virtual%20Console\"&gt;Virtual Console&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 and is also one of the games included in the compilation game \"&lt;a href=\"Kirby%27s%20Dream%20Collection\"&gt;Kirby's Dream Collection&lt;/a&gt;\" for the &lt;a href=\"Wii\"&gt;Wii&lt;/a&gt;, released to celebrate the series' 20th anniversary.\nGameplay.\n\"Kirby's Dream Land\" is a &lt;a href=\"Side-scrolling%20video%20game\"&gt;side-scrolling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Action%20game\"&gt;action&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Platform%20game\"&gt;platformer&lt;/a&gt;. Like many other platformers of the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28third%20generation%29\"&gt;8-bit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fourth%20generation%29\"&gt;16-bit era of video games&lt;/a&gt;, levels are played on a &lt;a href=\"two-dimensional%20space\"&gt;two-dimensional&lt;/a&gt; plane in which the &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kirby%20%28character%29\"&gt;Kirby&lt;/a&gt;, can move left or right as well as jump. Kirby's main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, after which the player can choose to swallow or spit them out as a &lt;a href=\"Five-pointed%20star\"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt;-shaped projectile attack. In addition to running and jumping, Kirby can fly by inflating himself with a mouthful of air and flapping his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby's only method of attack is to release the air puff held in his mouth which cancels his flight.\nThe game consists of a total of five levels. Levels are made up of a series of large \"rooms\" connected by doors that lead Kirby to different areas, rather than the single continuous corridors typical of platformers at the time. Some of these doors lead to hidden areas or alternate pathways through the level. The doors act as checkpoints returning the player to the beginning of a \"room\" should they die rather than starting the level over. The goal of the game is to clear the level by defeating the boss at the end. If Kirby touches an enemy or a dangerous object, he loses one or more of his health, depending on the enemy or obstacle he touched. If all of his health is lost, or he falls into a bottomless pit, the player loses a life. Losing all lives results in a game over. Kirby can recover lost health by eating food, found across the stage.\nUnlike the copy abilities of later games, \"Kirby's Dream Land\" has more traditional &lt;a href=\"power-up\"&gt;power-up&lt;/a&gt;s that offer Kirby temporary abilities when he picks them up, although they are not a big part of gameplay. These often appear in the form of food, such as Spicy Curry that gives Kirby fire breath or a Mint Leaf (Sweet Potato in the Japanese version) that lets Kirby fire air puffs rapidly without losing flight. At the end of each level is a &lt;a href=\"boss%20%28video%20games%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; Kirby must fight to obtain one of the Sparkling Stars. Most bosses are fought by sucking up small objects or projectiles created by the boss' attacks and spitting them back at the boss. The third boss, Kaboola, is fought using an unlimited version of the Mint Leaf item, incorporating &lt;a href=\"shoot%20%27em%20up\"&gt;shoot 'em up&lt;/a&gt; elements. The last level before the &lt;a href=\"boss%20%28video%20gaming%29\"&gt;final boss&lt;/a&gt; consists of a boss rush, where Kirby must fight all of the game's bosses again going through a short area based on that boss's home level. There are also many &lt;a href=\"Mini-Boss\"&gt;mini-bosses&lt;/a&gt; during the levels.\nLike many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points by defeating enemies and collecting items, with an &lt;a href=\"1-up\"&gt;extra life&lt;/a&gt; granted when the player has enough points. However, because \"Kirby's Dream Land\" lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a game over, or if the player resets the game. Once the game has been completed, a code is offered to play an optional extra game, in which the difficulty is significantly increased. Completing the extra game offered a second code that lets the player adjust lives and vitality settings to play an easier or even harder game, and listen to music and sound effects freely.\nPlot.\n\"Kirby's Dream Land\" is set in the &lt;a href=\"fictional%20country\"&gt;fictional country&lt;/a&gt; of Dream Land located on a tiny star-shaped planet far, far away from &lt;a href=\"Earth\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;. The Dream Landers are a very peaceful and carefree people that use their magical Sparkling Stars to play and work among the heavens.\nOne night, under the cover of darkness, the gluttonous &lt;a href=\"King%20Dedede\"&gt;King Dedede&lt;/a&gt; and his minions swoop down from his &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; on Mt. Dedede and steal all the food in Dream Land as well as the Sparkling Stars used to obtain more food. The next morning as the residents are discussing what to do, a spry little boy named &lt;a href=\"Kirby%20%28character%29\"&gt;Kirby&lt;/a&gt;, steps forward and volunteers to retrieve the food and stars, and stop Dedede.\nDevelopment.\n\"Kirby's Dream Land\" was developed by &lt;a href=\"Masahiro%20Sakurai\"&gt;Masahiro Sakurai&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"HAL%20Laboratory\"&gt;HAL Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the programming was done on a &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Famicom\"&gt;Twin Famicom&lt;/a&gt;, a Nintendo-licensed console produced by &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Corporation\"&gt;Sharp Corporation&lt;/a&gt; that combined a &lt;a href=\"Famicom\"&gt;Famicom&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Famicom%20Disk%20System\"&gt;Famicom Disk System&lt;/a&gt; in one unit. As the Twin Famicom did not have &lt;a href=\"Computer%20keyboard\"&gt;keyboard&lt;/a&gt; support, a &lt;a href=\"trackball\"&gt;trackball&lt;/a&gt; was used in tandem with an &lt;a href=\"on-screen%20keyboard\"&gt;on-screen keyboard&lt;/a&gt; to input values; Sakurai described the process, which he assumed was \"the way [game programming] was done\" at the time, as similar to \"using a lunchbox to make lunch.\"\nKirby initially was a dummy character that the developers used until they could define a more sophisticated image. However the designers grew to like Kirby so much that they decided to keep him instead of using a more advanced character. At the time he was to be named , and \"Kirby's Dream Land\" was titled . Eventually, he was renamed Kirby and the game was renamed \"Hoshi no Kirby\"; \"Kirby of the Stars\", also the name of the Japanese version of the \"Kirby\" anime.\nDuring the development of what was referred to as \"Twinkle Popo\", there was some initial confusion over the color scheme of Popopo/Kirby. Sakurai had always intended him to be pink, and the concept art reflects this, but Kirby was not pink in the game itself, as the Game Boy system had a monochrome display. Other members of the development team were unaware of Kirby's coloration; in particular, &lt;a href=\"Shigeru%20Miyamoto\"&gt;Shigeru Miyamoto&lt;/a&gt; initially thought that he was yellow. Although pink is still Kirby's main color, later games have used a yellow Kirby to represent the second player in multiplayer. When \"Kirby of the Stars\" was released in Japan, it featured a pink Kirby. However, Nintendo of America designed the North American box art and advertisements with a white Kirby based on the game's grey-scale visuals.\nThe music was composed by Jun Ishikawa. He has been a regular composer in the \"Kirby\" series. His most recent work was on \"\" in 2018. Certain songs were also reused in the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20%28series%29\"&gt;\"Super Smash Bros.\" series&lt;/a&gt; as the background music of the Dream Land stage in \"&lt;a href=\"Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/a&gt;\" and the Green Greens stage in \"&lt;a href=\"Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20Melee\"&gt;Super Smash Bros. Melee&lt;/a&gt;\".\nReception.\nContemporary.\nIn Japan, \"Hoshi no Kirby\" topped the \"&lt;a href=\"Famitsu\"&gt;Famitsu&lt;/a&gt;\" sales charts from &lt;a href=\"1992%20in%20video%20games\"&gt;May 1992&lt;/a&gt; to June 1992. In the United States, \"Kirby's Dream Land\" topped &lt;a href=\"Babbage%27s\"&gt;Babbage's&lt;/a&gt; Game Boy sales chart in October 1992. The game sold more than units worldwide by March 1993.\nBy May 28, 1994, \"Kirby's Dream Land\" had sold 1.3 million copies. By 1997, units had been sold. , it has sold in excess of 5 million copies worldwide; \"&lt;a href=\"Gamasutra\"&gt;Gamasutra&lt;/a&gt;\" cited its new style of gameplay for its success. At the time, it was &lt;a href=\"HAL%20Laboratory\"&gt;HAL Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;'s most successful game. Gamasutra's Osamu Inoue attributed the game's success to &lt;a href=\"Satoru%20Iwata\"&gt;Satoru Iwata&lt;/a&gt;, formerly an employee of HAL Laboratory, who Inoue comments has a \"simple-minded passion for creating games\".\n\"Kirby's Dream Land\" has received a generally positive reception. Upon release, \"&lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Power\"&gt;Nintendo Power&lt;/a&gt;\" editors George and Bob shared generally positive opinions of the game; George stated that it is a really fun game, owing its quality to its excellent play control and well thought out concept, while Bob stated that it is deceptively simple looking, when it in fact features a decent challenge for more experienced gamers.\nRetrospective.\nRetrospectively, it holds an aggregate score of 62% on &lt;a href=\"GameRankings\"&gt;GameRankings&lt;/a&gt; with nine reviews, making it the 17th best Game Boy game. \"&lt;a href=\"Game%20Informer\"&gt;Game Informer&lt;/a&gt;\"s Ben Reeves called it the 14th best Game Boy game and felt that it was a relaxing game. Author Wendy Despain used \"Kirby's Dream Land\"s plot as an example of how early platform games' plots progressed, which she collectively described as \"the main character needing to reach a villain to put right a wrong.\" Humongous Life's Jonathan Wahlgren called it a strong game, but felt it to be \"too elementary\". &lt;a href=\"GamesRadar\"&gt;GamesRadar&lt;/a&gt;'s Brett Elston did an article on its music, specifically giving praise to the final boss music, stating that it is the \"only song in the original Kirby that had a sense of challenge or conflict instead of skipping through a field of floating cakes.\" Nadia Oxford of \"&lt;a href=\"1UP.com\"&gt;1UP.com&lt;/a&gt;\" praised it for its unique platforming mechanics, describing it as the start of a \"gluttonous legend\". &lt;a href=\"Allgame\"&gt;Allgame&lt;/a&gt;'s Joshua Crystal called it a \"great game for beginner players and ones that enjoy a fun, but short, experience.\"\nIn an article detailing various \"Kirby\" series video games, \"&lt;a href=\"IGN\"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt;\" stated that it was a decent platformer, but basic compared to later games. \"IGN\"'s Lucas M. Thomas and Craig Harris included \"Kirby's Dream Land\" in their wishlist for a hypothetical \"&lt;a href=\"Virtual%20Console\"&gt;Virtual Console&lt;/a&gt;\" for the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%203DS\"&gt;Nintendo 3DS&lt;/a&gt;, commenting that its inclusion would be based on nostalgia rather than it feeling \"new and sensational\". They also added that original characters like &lt;a href=\"Kirby%20%28character%29\"&gt;Kirby&lt;/a&gt; were the stars of the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy\"&gt;Game Boy&lt;/a&gt; rather than established characters such as &lt;a href=\"Link%20%28The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%29\"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mario\"&gt;Mario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samus%20Aran\"&gt;Samus Aran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pit%20%28Kid%20Icarus%29\"&gt;Pit&lt;/a&gt;. They would again praise \"Kirby's Dream Land\" for being an original game in their \"History of the Game Boy\" article, adding that while \"attitude\" was common in new platforming mascots, Kirby was cheery and adorable, while the game featured \"breezy, casual gameplay and lighthearted atmosphere\". &lt;a href=\"GameSpy\"&gt;GameSpy&lt;/a&gt;'s Gerald Villoria, Brian Altano, and Ryan Scott called it \"basic\" compared to later games in the series, adding that it lacked a sense of danger because Kirby could fly. &lt;a href=\"GamesRadar\"&gt;GamesRadar&lt;/a&gt; listed \"Kirby's Dream Land\" and its sequel as two of the games they want in the 3DS Virtual Console.\nSequels.\n\"Kirby's Dream Land\" has spawned numerous of sequels across several video game consoles. The first direct sequel, \"&lt;a href=\"Kirby%27s%20Adventure\"&gt;Kirby's Adventure&lt;/a&gt;\", released on the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System\"&gt;Nintendo Entertainment System&lt;/a&gt;, introduced the ability to steal powers from enemies, an ability which would become a staple of the series following it. The series has featured several spin-offs, in differing genres including a racing game \"&lt;a href=\"Kirby%20Air%20Ride\"&gt;Kirby Air Ride&lt;/a&gt;\", pinball game \"&lt;a href=\"Kirby%27s%20Pinball%20Land\"&gt;Kirby's Pinball Land&lt;/a&gt;\", and an &lt;a href=\"Action%20game\"&gt;action&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; hybrid game \"&lt;a href=\"Kirby%27s%20Dream%20Course\"&gt;Kirby's Dream Course&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Kirby's Dream Land\" would receive a Game Boy sequel in 1995, \"&lt;a href=\"Kirby%27s%20Dream%20Land%202\"&gt;Kirby's Dream Land 2&lt;/a&gt;\", which incorporated the copy mechanic from \"Kirby's Adventure\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System\"&gt;Super NES&lt;/a&gt; game \"&lt;a href=\"Kirby%20Super%20Star\"&gt;Kirby Super Star&lt;/a&gt;\" contains a shortened remake of \"Kirby's Dream Land\", \"Spring Breeze\". It features Kirby's copy ability from later games and the ability to summon helpers for co-op, but is missing the Castle Lololo stage and Kaboola boss fight, Lololo and Lalala becoming the boss for Float Island instead. \"Kirby Super Star Ultra\" expanded upon this with \"Revenge of The King\", a harder version of \"Spring Breeze\" that takes heavy inspiration from \"Kirby's Dream Land\"s extra mode and features longer levels more in line with the original game. Although Castle Lololo is still absent, Kaboola's boss fight returns in a reimagined form.\nKirby and King Dedede appear as playable characters in the &lt;a href=\"fighting%20game\"&gt;fighting game&lt;/a&gt; series \"&lt;a href=\"Super%20Smash%20Bros.\"&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/a&gt;\" Both characters have alternate costumes that give them a &lt;a href=\"monochrome\"&gt;monochrome&lt;/a&gt; appearance reminiscent of the Game Boy's graphics. The \"Green Greens\" stage, first appearing in \"&lt;a href=\"Super%20Smash%20Bros%20Melee\"&gt;Super Smash Bros Melee&lt;/a&gt;,\" is based on this game's first level. The \"Dream Land GB\" stage, introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20for%20Nintendo%203DS%20and%20Wii%20U\"&gt;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&lt;/a&gt;\", transitions between multiple locations from \"Kirby's Dream Land\" as displayed through a monochromatic Game Boy screen."
