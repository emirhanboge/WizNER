    "text": "James Shores Simpson (December 20, 1927 \u2013 January 13, 2016) was an American &lt;a href=\"sportscaster\"&gt;sportscaster&lt;/a&gt;, known for his smooth delivery as a &lt;a href=\"play-by-play\"&gt;play-by-play&lt;/a&gt; man and his versatility in covering many different sports. In &lt;a href=\"1997%20in%20sports\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;, he won the &lt;a href=\"Sports%20Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award\"&gt;Sports Lifetime Achievement Award&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"2000%20in%20sports\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt; he was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"National%20Sportscasters%20and%20Sportswriters%20Association\"&gt;National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"NSSA%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nJim Simpson was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in nearby &lt;a href=\"Chevy%20Chase%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Chevy Chase, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. He began his broadcasting career with a short-lived radio show, \"Hunting and Fishing with Jimmy Simpson\", when he was 15. He attended &lt;a href=\"George%20Washington%20University\"&gt;George Washington University&lt;/a&gt; and served in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy%20Reserve\"&gt;Navy Reserve&lt;/a&gt;. After several jobs in radio, he began working in television in Washington in 1949. \nIn the early 1950s, he shared a half-hour news program at Washington's &lt;a href=\"WUSA%20%28TV%29\"&gt;WTOP&lt;/a&gt;-TV with another TV newcomer, &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Cronkite\"&gt;Walter Cronkite&lt;/a&gt;, the future anchor of the \"&lt;a href=\"CBS%20Evening%20News\"&gt;CBS Evening News&lt;/a&gt;\". He joined NBC's &lt;a href=\"owned-and-operated\"&gt;owned-and-operated&lt;/a&gt; Washington station, &lt;a href=\"WRC-TV\"&gt;WRC-TV&lt;/a&gt;, in 1955. Simpson broadcast &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; games in the early 1960s and worked as a sports reporter at WRC-TV. \nNBC Sports.\nEventually he would broadcast many sports at &lt;a href=\"NBC%20Sports\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"NFL%20on%20NBC\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"College%20Basketball%20on%20NBC\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20NBC\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tennis%20on%20NBC\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Golf%20Channel%20on%20NBC\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;. For much of the 1960s and 1970s he was generally considered the network's number two play-by-play announcer, behind only &lt;a href=\"Curt%20Gowdy\"&gt;Curt Gowdy&lt;/a&gt;. He was in &lt;a href=\"New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;New Haven, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; on November 22, 1963, to do the annual &lt;a href=\"Harvard%E2%80%93Yale%20football%20rivalry\"&gt;Harvard-Yale football game&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Lindsey%20Nelson\"&gt;Lindsey Nelson&lt;/a&gt; and Terry Brennan, when word came of the assassination of &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. Simpson was quoted as saying to Nelson as they walked through the tunnel of the &lt;a href=\"Yale%20Bowl\"&gt;Yale Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, \"We will remember this walk and this moment for a long, long, time.\" His work on &lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20League\"&gt;American Football League&lt;/a&gt; (and later &lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;American Football Conference&lt;/a&gt;) telecasts for NBC is perhaps what he is best remembered for. \nIn 1966, Simpson and &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Cullen\"&gt;Bill Cullen&lt;/a&gt; (who at the time, along with Simpson hosted a sports &lt;a href=\"anthology%20series\"&gt;anthology series&lt;/a&gt; called \"NBC Sports in Action\"), were the between-periods co-hosts for &lt;a href=\"NHL%20on%20NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"1966%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals\"&gt;Stanley Cup Finals&lt;/a&gt; broadcasts. It marked the first time that the Stanley Cup Finals were broadcast on American network television. It was also the first time that hockey games were broadcast on network television in &lt;a href=\"color%20television\"&gt;color&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Hockey%20Night%20in%20Canada\"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt; would follow suit the following year.\nOn January 15, 1967, Simpson (along with former quarterback &lt;a href=\"George%20Ratterman\"&gt;George Ratterman&lt;/a&gt;) called &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20I\"&gt;Super Bowl I&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"NFL%20on%20NBC%20Radio\"&gt;NBC Radio&lt;/a&gt;. He also called several &lt;a href=\"World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20NBC%20Radio\"&gt;NBC Radio&lt;/a&gt;, as well as numerous &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Orange Bowl&lt;/a&gt; games, the &lt;a href=\"1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1966 FIFA World Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; (via tape delay), and several &lt;a href=\"Olympics%20on%20NBC\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; for NBC television.\nESPN.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1979%20in%20television\"&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt;, after Week 2 of the &lt;a href=\"1979%20NFL%20season\"&gt;NFL season&lt;/a&gt;, the fledgling &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; cable sports network brought Simpson on board to provide some needed credibility with sports fans. Simpson broadcast the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20061110/ai_n16848468\"&gt;first NCAA basketball game&lt;/a&gt; the network televised, with flamboyant &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Vitale\"&gt;Dick Vitale&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"color%20commentator\"&gt;color man&lt;/a&gt;. Vitale &lt;a href=\"http%3A//findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_10_228/ai_114086625\"&gt;credits&lt;/a&gt; Simpson with helping him develop as a sportscaster. Simpson also called &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Football%20League%20on%20television\"&gt;USFL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NBA%20on%20ESPN\"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20College%20Football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"College%20World%20Series\"&gt;College World Series&lt;/a&gt; games for ESPN, in &lt;a href=\"1988%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Orioles\"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;' local telecasts on &lt;a href=\"WMAR-TV\"&gt;WMAR-TV&lt;/a&gt; (the NBC affiliate at the time), and called &lt;a href=\"figure%20skating\"&gt;figure skating&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Figure%20skating%20at%20the%201992%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Figure%20skating%20at%20the%201994%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Olympics%20on%20TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter his sportscasting days Simpson retired to &lt;a href=\"St.%20Croix\"&gt;St. Croix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Islands\"&gt;Virgin Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Among other firsts he was the initial U.S. sportscaster to appear live via satellite from &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, and he was involved in the first American sportscast using &lt;a href=\"instant%20replay\"&gt;instant replay&lt;/a&gt; technology. In &lt;a href=\"2005%20in%20television\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, ESPN brought Simpson back from retirement to do play-by-play for a series of college basketball games in a \"turn back the clock\" format on the &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Classic\"&gt;ESPN Classic&lt;/a&gt; network. He died on January 13, 2016, in Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 88."
