He was the second officer in the artillery to hold that position, the other being &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Jackson%20Hunt\"&gt;Henry Jackson Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. His guns participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg\"&gt;Battle of Fredericksburg&lt;/a&gt;, providing artillery support for the series of assaults on &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20Army\"&gt;Confederate&lt;/a&gt; positions on the heights near &lt;a href=\"Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Fredericksburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaj. Gen. &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Hooker\"&gt;Joseph Hooker&lt;/a&gt; assumed command of the Army of the Potomac and reorganized it, creating a formal Artillery Reserve under Tyler's command. The reserve was expanded to five brigades and 118 guns. Tyler commanded the reserve during the battles of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville\"&gt;Chancellorsville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Gettysburg\"&gt;Gettysburg&lt;/a&gt;, where many of his guns were used to help repel Confederate attacks on Union positions such as &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20Ridge\"&gt;Cemetery Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cemetery%20Hill\"&gt;Cemetery Hill&lt;/a&gt;, as well as during &lt;a href=\"Pickett%27s%20Charge\"&gt;Pickett's Charge&lt;/a&gt; on July 3. During the battle, he had two horses shot from under him. Tyler was disabled by &lt;a href=\"sun%20stroke\"&gt;sun stroke&lt;/a&gt; during part of the Gettysburg campaign. In the Fall of 1863, Tyler also participated in the &lt;a href=\"Bristoe%20Campaign\"&gt;Bristoe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mine%20Run%20Campaign\"&gt;Mine Run&lt;/a&gt; campaigns, but played no major role.\nIn early 1864, Tyler was assigned command of a division of &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; consisting entirely of heavy artillery regiments, which he led at Harris Farm in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Spotsylvania%20Court%20House\"&gt;Battle of Spotsylvania Court House&lt;/a&gt;, where it was attached to &lt;a href=\"II%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29\"&gt;II Corps&lt;/a&gt;. He then led a brigade in 2nd Division, II Corps, at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cold%20Harbor\"&gt;Battle of Cold Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and was severely wounded by a bullet in his ankle which incapacitated him from any further field duty during the war. After a 6 month recovery, Tyler served in an administrative role in command of the District of Delaware and the Eastern Shore with his headquarters in Philadelphia.\nPost-Civil War.\nAt the close of the war, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20War\"&gt;War Department&lt;/a&gt; rewarded scores of officers with brevet promotions dating from March 1865. Tyler received the brevet rank of &lt;a href=\"Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;major general&lt;/a&gt; of volunteers for \"great gallantry at the Battle of Cold Harbor\". In 1866 he mustered out of volunteer service and was commissioned as a &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Regular%20Army%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;regular army&lt;/a&gt;, serving as deputy Quartermaster General in several locations.\nDeath and legacy.\nHis wartime injuries contributed to his declining health, and Tyler died in &lt;a href=\"Boston%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 42. He is buried in &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20Hill%20Cemetery%20%28Hartford%2C%20Connecticut%29\"&gt;Cedar Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in Hartford. Before he died, he was able to complete his autobiography, the \"Memoir of Brevet Major-General Robert Ogden Tyler\" (Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott, 1878).\nThe Robert O. Tyler Post #50 of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic\"&gt;Grand Army of the Republic&lt;/a&gt; in Hartford was named in his honor."
