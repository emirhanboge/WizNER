    "text": "The Cunning Little Vixen (; alternative English title: Tales of Vixen Sharp-Ears) is a Czech-language &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Leo%C5%A1%20Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek\"&gt;Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek&lt;/a&gt;, composed in 1921 to 1923. Its &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; was adapted by the composer from a 1920 serialized novella, \"Li\u0161ka Bystrou\u0161ka\", by &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20T%C4%9Bsnohl%C3%ADdek\"&gt;Rudolf T\u011bsnohl\u00eddek&lt;/a&gt;, which was first published in the newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Lidov%C3%A9%20noviny\"&gt;Lidov\u00e9 noviny&lt;/a&gt;\" (with illustrations by &lt;a href=\"Stanislav%20Lolek\"&gt;Stanislav Lolek&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe opera incorporates &lt;a href=\"Moravians\"&gt;Moravian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"folk%20music\"&gt;folk music&lt;/a&gt; and rhythms as it recounts the life of a clever (alternative reading: sharp-eared) fox and accompanying wildlife, as well as a few humans, and their small adventures while traversing their lifecycles. Described as a &lt;a href=\"comic%20opera\"&gt;comic opera&lt;/a&gt;, it has nonetheless been noted to contain a serious theme. Interpretations of the work remain varied, ranging from children's entertainment to &lt;a href=\"tragedy\"&gt;tragedy&lt;/a&gt;.\nTitle translation.\nBroken down from the original &lt;a href=\"Czech%20language\"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt;, the title is\nThere is no mention in the Czech of a diminutive (\"little\"), although this idea is included in both the German \"(Das schlaue F\u00fcchslein)\" and recent (since 1980s) English versions of the opera's name. It was probably the German name, used for the 1965 &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Felsenstein\"&gt;Felsenstein&lt;/a&gt; film, that established the English \"cunning little\", ignoring the important double meaning in \"Sharp-Ears.\" The first three audio recordings, all from the Czech company &lt;a href=\"Supraphon\"&gt;Supraphon&lt;/a&gt; (Neumann 1957, Gregor 1972, Neumann 1980) used, naturally, the original Czech name. Then &lt;a href=\"Decca%20Label%20Group\"&gt;Decca&lt;/a&gt; recorded the opera with the &lt;a href=\"Vienna%20Philharmonic\"&gt;Vienna Philharmonic&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, and this widely circulated release made \"The Cunning Little Vixen\" the international, if inaccurate, standard.\nComposition history.\nWhen Jan\u00e1\u010dek discovered T\u011bsnohl\u00eddek's &lt;a href=\"comic-strip\"&gt;comic-strip&lt;/a&gt;-inspired story and decided to turn it into an opera, he began work by meeting with the author and beginning a study of animals. With this understanding of the characters involved, his own 70 years of life experience, and an undying, unrequited love for the much younger, married &lt;a href=\"Kamila%20St%C3%B6sslov%C3%A1\"&gt;Kamila St\u00f6sslov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, he began work on the opera. He transformed the originally comedic cartoon into a philosophical reflection on the cycle of life and death by including the death of the vixen. As with other operas by older composers, this late opera shows a deep understanding of life leading to a return to simplicity.\nIt was given its premiere performance on 6 November 1924 in &lt;a href=\"National%20Theatre%20Brno\"&gt;National Theatre Brno&lt;/a&gt; conducted by &lt;a href=\"Franti%C5%A1ek%20Neumann\"&gt;Franti\u0161ek Neumann&lt;/a&gt;, with Ota Z\u00edtek as director and Eduard Mil\u00e9n as stage designer.\nPerformance history.\nThe opera received its Italian premiere at &lt;a href=\"La%20Scala\"&gt;La Scala&lt;/a&gt; in 1958 with &lt;a href=\"Mariella%20Adani\"&gt;Mariella Adani&lt;/a&gt; in the title role. \nThe work was first staged in England in 1961 by the Sadler's Wells Opera Company (now the &lt;a href=\"English%20National%20Opera\"&gt;English National Opera&lt;/a&gt;) with &lt;a href=\"June%20Bronhill\"&gt;June Bronhill&lt;/a&gt; in the title, albeit with a tenor Fox (Kevin Miller); the director was &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Graham\"&gt;Colin Graham&lt;/a&gt;, with conductor &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Davis\"&gt;Colin Davis&lt;/a&gt;, and scenery and costume designs by &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Kay\"&gt;Barry Kay&lt;/a&gt;. A production by &lt;a href=\"David%20Pountney\"&gt;David Pountney&lt;/a&gt; was mounted by the three UK national companies in the 1980s, first being seen with &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Opera\"&gt;Scottish Opera&lt;/a&gt; at the 1980 &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20Festival\"&gt;Edinburgh Festival&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20National%20Opera\"&gt;Welsh National Opera&lt;/a&gt; in London the following year and finally with English National Opera in June 1988; nearly 40 years on Pountney supervised a revival by Welsh National Opera in Cardiff and on tour.\nIn 1981, the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Opera\"&gt;New York City Opera&lt;/a&gt; mounted a production in English based on images created by Maurice Sendak and conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas in his company debut. It starred soprano &lt;a href=\"Gianna%20Rolandi\"&gt;Gianna Rolandi&lt;/a&gt; as Vixen Sharp-Ears and baritone &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Cross%20%28bass-baritone%29\"&gt;Richard Cross&lt;/a&gt; as the Forester. &lt;a href=\"Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera\"&gt;Glyndebourne Festival Opera&lt;/a&gt; staged it in 2012, directed by Melly Still, and a revival was included in the Glyndebourne Festival for 2016 with &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Purves\"&gt;Christopher Purves&lt;/a&gt; as the Forester and Elena Tsallagova as the Vixen, conductor &lt;a href=\"Jakub%20Hr%C5%AF%C5%A1a\"&gt;Jakub Hr\u016f\u0161a&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra\"&gt;London Philharmonic Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May 2014 the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Orchestra\"&gt;Cleveland Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, conducted by &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Welser-M%C3%B6st\"&gt;Franz Welser-M\u00f6st&lt;/a&gt;, performed an innovative version directed by &lt;a href=\"Yuval%20Sharon\"&gt;Yuval Sharon&lt;/a&gt;. This production returned the opera to its roots by utilizing animation and hand drawn video sets by the artists &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Barminski\"&gt;Bill Barminski&lt;/a&gt; and Christopher Louie of &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Robot\"&gt;Walter Robot&lt;/a&gt; Studios. The production featured the use of hole-in-the-wall carnival cutouts to place the singers' heads on the animated bodies of the animal characters.\nGlimmerglass Opera staged a new production in the summer of 2018.\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\nIn the forest, the animals and insects are playing and dancing. The Forester enters and lies down against a tree for a nap. A curious Vixen Cub (usually sung by a young girl), inquisitively chases a frog right into the lap of the surprised forester who forcibly takes the vixen home as a pet. Time passes (in the form of an orchestral interlude) and we see the Vixen, now grown up into a young adult (and sung by a soprano), tied up in the forester's yard with the conservative old dachshund. Fed up with life in confinement, the vixen chews through her rope, attacks the Cock and Chocholka the hen, kills the other chickens, jumps over the fence and runs off to freedom.\nAct 2.\nThe vixen takes over a badger's home and kicks him out. In the inn, the pastor, the forester, and the schoolmaster drink and talk about their mutual infatuation with the gypsy girl Terynka. The drunken schoolmaster leaves the inn and mistakes a sunflower behind which the vixen is hiding for Terynka and confesses his devotion to her. The forester, also on his way home, sees the vixen and fires two shots at her, sending her running. Later, the vixen, coming into her womanhood, meets a charming boy fox, and they retire to the badger's home. An unexpected pregnancy and a forest full of gossipy creatures necessitate their marriage, which rounds out the act.\nAct 3.\nThe poacher Harasta is engaged to Terynka and is out hunting in preparation for their marriage. He sets a fox trap, which the numerous fox and vixen cubs mock. Harasta, watching from a distance, shoots and kills the vixen, sending her children running. At Harasta's wedding, the forester sees the vixen's fur, which Harasta gave to Terynka as a wedding present, and flees to the forest to reflect. He returns to the place where he met the vixen, and sits at the tree grieving the loss of both the vixen and Terynka. His grief grows until, just as in the beginning of the opera, a frog unexpectedly jumps in his lap, the grandson of the one who did so in Act 1. This reassurance of the cycle of death leading to new life gives his heart a deep peace.\nMusic.\nApart from \"The Excursions of Mr. Brou\u010dek\", this is Jan\u00e1\u010dek's lightest opera, and, despite the titular vixen's death at the end of the work, it stands in contrast to the often brutally serious nature of operas such as \"&lt;a href=\"Jen%C5%AFfa\"&gt;Jen\u016ffa&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"K%C3%A1%C5%A5a%20Kabanov%C3%A1\"&gt;K\u00e1\u0165a Kabanov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;\". In \"The Cunning Little Vixen\", the composer moved away from the more conversational style of previous and subsequent operas in favor of a more folk-like style, and wove into its fabric some of his most experimental opera concepts (ballet, mime, and orchestral interludes).\nJan\u00e1\u010dek based \"The Cunning Little Vixen\"s &lt;a href=\"tonality\"&gt;tonality&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"mode%20%28music%29\"&gt;modes&lt;/a&gt; (similarly to much output during his last decade), expanding the music's harmonic range through the utilisation of the &lt;a href=\"seventh%20chord\"&gt;seventh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ninth%20chord\"&gt;ninth&lt;/a&gt; chords. The composition makes frequent use of folk-influenced rhythms and \"&lt;a href=\"Leo%C5%A1%20Jan%C3%A1%C4%8Dek%23Style\"&gt;s\u010dasovka&lt;/a&gt;\" (personally-coined term for a short &lt;a href=\"motif%20%28music%29\"&gt;motif&lt;/a&gt;), while it has been noted to contain similarities to the music of French composer &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Debussy\"&gt;Claude Debussy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt Jan\u00e1\u010dek's request, the final scene from \" The Cunning Little Vixen\" was performed at his funeral in 1928.\nAdaptations.\n&lt;a href=\"Ursula%20Dubosarsky\"&gt;Ursula Dubosarsky&lt;/a&gt;'s 2018 novel for children, \"Brindabella\", is based on &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20T%C4%9Bsnohl%C3%ADdek\"&gt;Rudolf T\u011bsnohl\u00eddek&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Vixen Sharp Ears\", the source story of the Cunning Little Vixen, relocated in the Australian bush, with the role of the Vixen played by a kangaroo.\nReferences.\nNotes\nSources"
