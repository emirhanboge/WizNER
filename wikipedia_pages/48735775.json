    "text": "The Conduct of Jazz is an album by American jazz pianist &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Shipp\"&gt;Matthew Shipp&lt;/a&gt; recorded in 2015 and released on &lt;a href=\"Thirsty%20Ear%20Recordings\"&gt;Thirsty Ear&lt;/a&gt;'s Blue Series. It was the debut recording by the trio with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Bisio\"&gt;Michael Bisio&lt;/a&gt; on bass and &lt;a href=\"Newman%20Taylor%20Baker\"&gt;Newman Taylor Baker&lt;/a&gt; on drums.\nReception.\nThe &lt;a href=\"All%20About%20Jazz\"&gt;All About Jazz&lt;/a&gt; review by Troy Collins states \"From abstract expressionism to bluesy introspection, every facet of Shipp's artistry is on display.. \"The Conduct of Jazz\" offers irrefutable proof of Shipp's enduring mastery of the jazz idiom.\"\nIn another review for &lt;a href=\"All%20About%20Jazz\"&gt;All About Jazz&lt;/a&gt;, John Sharpe notes \"Shipp in full flow is unmistakable\u2014 a unique stylist who propounds his memorable mix of infectious motifs, glittering runs and avalanches of dense clusters.\"\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Down%20Beat\"&gt;Down Beat&lt;/a&gt;\" review by Ken Micallef says \"Shipp mines so many inspired melodic and rhythmic collisions that it\u2019s worth focusing on the individual moments that make up the pianist\u2019s larger compositional landscape: the Monkish delights of the title track, the nightmarish spirals of 'Ball And Space,' the expansive trio skirmishes of 'Primary Form' \u2014together they form a gateway to higher improvisation that is practically without parallel.\""
