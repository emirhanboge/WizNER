    "text": "Richard Ray Grapenthin (born April 16, 1958) is an American former &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"baseball%20player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, a right-handed &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; who appeared in 19 &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"games%20pitched\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;, 18 in &lt;a href=\"relief%20pitcher\"&gt;relief&lt;/a&gt;, for the &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20Expos\"&gt;Montreal Expos&lt;/a&gt; for parts of three seasons between and .\nThe , Grapenthin played collegiately at &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20State%20University\"&gt;Indiana State University&lt;/a&gt; and was signed as an undrafted &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt; by Montreal on July 9, 1980. He progressed through the Montreal system \u2014 posting a microscopic 0.80 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; in 45 &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings pitched&lt;/a&gt; for the Class A &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20Expos\"&gt;San Jose Expos&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"California%20League\"&gt;California League&lt;/a&gt; in 1982. He made his MLB debut on May 3, 1983. &lt;a href=\"Starting%20pitcher\"&gt;Starting pitcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Sanderson%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Scott Sanderson&lt;/a&gt; retired the &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Braves\"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt; in order in the top of the first &lt;a href=\"inning\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt;, but on the third &lt;a href=\"out%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;out&lt;/a&gt;, he was spiked in the pitching hand by &lt;a href=\"Claudell%20Washington\"&gt;Claudell Washington&lt;/a&gt; and was forced to leave the game. Grapenthin relieved Sanderson in the second, and kept Atlanta off the scoreboard for his first two innings; but in his third frame, he allowed a three-run &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Horner\"&gt;Bob Horner&lt;/a&gt; and a solo shot to &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Chambliss\"&gt;Chris Chambliss&lt;/a&gt;, and was tagged with the eventual 5\u20132 &lt;a href=\"loss%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;loss&lt;/a&gt;. It was his only MLB appearance of ; he was sent back to the &lt;a href=\"Triple-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Triple-A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wichita%20Aeros\"&gt;Wichita Aeros&lt;/a&gt; and played out the season there.\nThe campaign saw Grapenthin spend the early months at Triple-A with the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Indians\"&gt;Indianapolis Indians&lt;/a&gt;, but he was recalled by the Expos in August, and on August 5, 1984, he made his second MLB appearance, and only starting assignment, at &lt;a href=\"Wrigley%20Field\"&gt;Wrigley Field&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Cubs\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;. In the third inning, he surrendered a &lt;a href=\"grand%20slam%20home%20run\"&gt;grand slam home run&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Moreland\"&gt;Keith Moreland&lt;/a&gt;, the key blow in a 4\u20133 Montreal defeat. However, Grapenthin went unscored upon in his next four relief appearances, and was largely effective coming out of Montreal's &lt;a href=\"bullpen\"&gt;bullpen&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the season. He earned &lt;a href=\"save%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;saves&lt;/a&gt; on August 22 and September 5, and his only MLB &lt;a href=\"win%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;victory&lt;/a&gt; on September 10. The win came when he relieved a beleaguered &lt;a href=\"David%20Palmer%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;David Palmer&lt;/a&gt; in the first inning against the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; with only one out and four &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; in and the &lt;a href=\"bases%20loaded\"&gt;bases loaded&lt;/a&gt;. Grapenthin retired the next two hitters, then pitched scoreless 4 innings of scoreless, &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;one-hit&lt;/a&gt; ball, while Montreal rallied at bat. He left the game with the Expos in the lead 8\u20134 and received credit for the victory.\nGrapenthin pitched in five games for the Expos and was sent back to Indianapolis, ending his MLB career. All told, he allowed 36 hits and 16 &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt; in his 34 MLB &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings pitched&lt;/a&gt;, with 16 &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt;s and two saves. He later played at Triple-A for the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Padres\"&gt;San Diego Padres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Tigers\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Yankees\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; organizations, and concluded his minor league career in 1989 after ten professional seasons."
