Her work is inherently collaborative and collective. In 2009, Montoya became a core member of &lt;a href=\"Ghana%20Think%20Tank\"&gt;Ghana Think Tank&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Robbins%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Christopher Robbins&lt;/a&gt; and John Ewing. Ghana Think Tank is an international artist collective that \"develops the first world\" by flipping traditional power dynamics, asking people living in the \"&lt;a href=\"third%20world\"&gt;third world&lt;/a&gt;\" to intervene into the lives of the people living in the so-called \"developed\" world. Montoya is an assistant professor in sculpture and spatial practices at the &lt;a href=\"Corcoran%20School%20of%20the%20Arts%20and%20Design\"&gt;Corcoran School of Art and Design&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"George%20Washington%20University\"&gt;George Washington University&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education.\nMaria del Carmen Montoya grew up on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Houston\"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, Texas, in a &lt;a href=\"Northside%2C%20Houston\"&gt;Northside&lt;/a&gt; working-class neighborhood.\nHer mother, for whom she was named, was born on the Palo Alto ranch in the &lt;a href=\"Sonoran%20Desert\"&gt;Sonoran Desert&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico.

Her mother now runs a small import stand in a &lt;a href=\"Fiesta%20Mart\"&gt;Fiesta Mart&lt;/a&gt;. Montoya's personal family history of immigration and experience with &lt;a href=\"fringe%20culture\"&gt;fringe culture&lt;/a&gt;s deeply influences her artistic practice.\nEducation.\nMontoya earned a BA from &lt;a href=\"Loyola%20University%20Chicago\"&gt;Loyola University Chicago&lt;/a&gt; in 1995, where she studied philosophy and women's studies.
