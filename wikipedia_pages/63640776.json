The first was constructed in 1959 and last one was built in 1991. The Bermuda 40 was Hinckley's first &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt; boat.\nDesign.\nThe Bermuda 40 is a recreational &lt;a href=\"keelboat\"&gt;keelboat&lt;/a&gt;, built predominantly of fiberglass, with &lt;a href=\"teak\"&gt;teak&lt;/a&gt; wood trim, including the cockpit coaming. It has a &lt;a href=\"masthead%20sloop\"&gt;masthead sloop&lt;/a&gt; rig or optional &lt;a href=\"yawl\"&gt;yawl&lt;/a&gt; rig, with coated &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt; spars. It features a spooned &lt;a href=\"raked%20stem\"&gt;raked stem&lt;/a&gt;, a raised counter &lt;a href=\"Transom%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;transom&lt;/a&gt;, a keel-mounted &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20wheel\"&gt;wheel&lt;/a&gt; and a fixed long &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"centreboard\"&gt;centreboard&lt;/a&gt;, operated via a &lt;a href=\"worm%20gear\"&gt;worm gear&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe boat is fitted with a &lt;a href=\"Westerbeke\"&gt;Westerbeke&lt;/a&gt; 4-107 &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt; of for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of .\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for six people, with a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin, two straight settee berths in the main cabin around the drop-leaf dinette table, each settee with a pilot berth above. The &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; is located on the port side at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"companionway\"&gt;companionway&lt;/a&gt; ladder. The galley is \"L\"-shaped and is equipped with a three-burner &lt;a href=\"propane\"&gt;propane&lt;/a&gt;-fired stove and a sink. A navigation station is opposite the galley, on the starboard side and employs the &lt;a href=\"icebox\"&gt;icebox&lt;/a&gt; top as a chart table. A refrigerator was optional. The &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is located just aft of the bow cabin on the port side and includes a shower. Stowage includes built-in bookcases, as well as wet lockers.\nFor sailing there are two primary and two secondary cockpit winches as well as winches for the &lt;a href=\"mainsail\"&gt;mainsail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jib\"&gt;jib&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"halyard\"&gt;halyard&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"mainsheet\"&gt;mainsheet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mizzen%20mast\"&gt;mizzen mast&lt;/a&gt; halyard and the &lt;a href=\"sheet%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;sheet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jiffy%20reefing\"&gt;Jiffy reefing&lt;/a&gt; is provided, with two reefing points.\nThe design has a &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Handicap%20Racing%20Fleet\"&gt;PHRF&lt;/a&gt; racing average handicap of 163.\nOperational history.\nA review in 2010 by Charles Doane indicated, \"with its classic long overhangs, perfectly pitched sheer line, wide side-decks, graceful cabin profile, and distinctive near-vertical transom, the Bermuda 40 has inspired severe lust in the heart of many a cruising sailor. Designed by Bill Tripp, Jr., it is without doubt one of the most attractive production sailboats ever conceived.\"\nIn May 1998 Jack Horner of spinsheet.com wrote \u201cthe B-40 was to become the bellwether for future production and established Hinckley as the premier North American Yacht builder of exceptional quality sailing yachts\u201d.\nIn a 2017 used boat review, some 59 years after it was designed, a \"The Spin Sheet\" reviewer stated, \"I don\u2019t recall a time when my sense of style, balance and proper proportion of sailing yachts has not been influenced by the design work of the late Bill Tripp. The Bermuda 40 is a quintessential example of Tripp\u2019s art and masterful eye for near-perfect balance. I think it can be safely said that this boat has stood the test of time, and, although the design is now 40 years old, many people, myself among them, still consider the Bermuda 40 one of the most beautiful yachts afloat.\"\nSee also.\nSimilar sailboats"
