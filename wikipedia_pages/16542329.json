    "text": "The goat problem is either of two related problems in &lt;a href=\"recreational%20mathematics\"&gt;recreational mathematics&lt;/a&gt; involving at least figuratively a tethered goat (horse, bull) grazing a circular area: the interior grazing problem and the exterior grazing problem. The former involves grazing the &lt;a href=\"Disk%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;interior of a circular area&lt;/a&gt;, and the latter, grazing the exterior of a circular area.\nThe original problem was the exterior grazing problem and appeared in the 1748 edition of the English annual journal \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ladies%27%20Diary\"&gt;The Ladies' Diary&lt;/a&gt;: or, the Woman\u2019s Almanack\", designated as Question\u00a0 attributed to Upnorensis (an unknown historical figure), stated thus:\nObserving a horse tied to feed in a gentlemen\u2019s park, with one end of a rope to his fore foot, and the other end to one of the circular iron rails, inclosing a pond, the circumference of which rails being 160\u00a0yards, equal to the length of the rope, what quantity of ground at most, could the horse feed?\nThe related problem involving area in the interior of a circle without reference to barnyard animals first appeared in 1894 in the first edition of the renown journal \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Mathematical%20Monthly\"&gt;American Mathematical Monthly&lt;/a&gt;\". Attributed to Charles E. Myers, it was stated as:\nA circle containing one acre is cut by another whose center is on the circumference of the given circle, and the area common to both is one-half acre. Find the radius of the cutting circle.\nThe solutions in both cases are non-trivial but yield to straightforward application of trigonometry, analytical geometry or integral calculus. Both problems are intrinsically transcendental \u2013 they do not have closed-form analytical solutions in the Euclidean plane. The numerical answers must be obtained by an iterative approximation procedure. The goat problems do not yield any new mathematical insights; rather they are primarily exercises in how to artfully deconstruct problems in order to facilitate solution.\nThree-dimensional analogues and planar boundary/area problems on other shapes, including the obvious rectangular barn and/or field, have been proposed and solved. A generalized solution for any smooth convex curve like an ellipse, and even unclosed curves, has been formulated.\nExterior grazing problem.\nThe question about the grazable area outside a circle is considered. This concerns a situation where the animal is tethered to a silo. The complication here is that the grazing area overlaps around the silo (i.e., in general, the tether is longer than one half the circumference of the silo): the goat can only eat the grass once, he can't eat it twice. The answer to the problem as proposed was given in the 1749 issue of the magazine by a Mr. Heath, and stated as 76,257.86 sq.yds. which was arrived at partly by \"trial and a table of logarithms\". The answer is not so accurate as the number of digits of precision would suggest. No analytical solution was provided.\nA useful approximation.\nLet tether length \"R\"\u00a0=\u00a0160\u00a0yds. and silo radius \"r\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"R\"/(2)\u00a0yds. The involute in the fourth quadrant is a nearly circular arc. One can imagine a circular segment with the same perimeter (arc length) would enclose nearly the same area; the radius and therefore the area of that segment could be readily computed. The arc length of an involute is given by formula_1 so the arc length |FG| of the involute in the fourth quadrant is formula_2. Let \"c\" be the length of an arc segment of the involute between the \"y\"-axis and a vertical line tangent to the silo at \"\u03b8\"\u00a0=\u00a03/2; it is the arc subtended by\u00a0\"\u03a6\". formula_3 (while the arc is minutely longer than\u00a0\"r\", the difference is negligible). So formula_4. The arc length of a circular arc is formula_5 and \"\u03b8\" here is /2 radians of the fourth quadrant, so formula_6, \"r\" the radius of the circular arc is formula_7 and the area of the circular segment bounded by it is formula_8. The area of the involute excludes half the area of the silo (1018.61) in the fourth quadrant, so its approx area is 18146, and the grazable area including the half circle of radius R, (formula_9) totals formula_10. That is 249 sq.yds. greater than the correct area of 76256, an error of just 0.33%. This method of approximating may not be quite so good for angles &lt;\u00a03/2 of the involute.\nIf it matters, there is a constructive way to obtain a quick and very accurate estimate of formula_11: draw a diagonal from point formula_12 on the circcumference of the pond to its intersection on the y-axis. The length of the diagonal is 120yds. because it is formula_13 of the tether. So the other leg of the triangle, the hypotenuse as drawn, is formula_14 yds. So formula_15 radians, rounded to three places.\nSolution by integrating with polar coordinates.\nFind the area between a circle and its involute over an angle of 2 to \u22122 excluding any overlap. In Cartesian coordinates, the equation of the involute is transcendental; doing a line integral there is hardly feasible. A more felicitous approach is to use polar coordinates\u00a0(\"z\",\"\u03b8\"). Because the \"sweep\" of the area under the involute is bounded by a tangent line (see diagram and derivation below) which is not the boundary (formula_16) between overlapping areas, the decomposition of the problem results in four computable areas: a half circle whose radius is the tether length (\"A\"1); the area \"swept\" by the tether over an angle of 2 (\"A\"2); the portion of area \"A\"2 from \"\u03b8\"\u00a0=\u00a00 to the tangent line segment formula_17 (\"A\"3); and the wedge area \"qFtq\" (\"A\"4). So, the desired area \"A\" is \"A\"1 + (\"A\"2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"A\"3\u00a0+\u00a0\"A\"4)\u00a0\u00b7\u00a02. The area(s) required to be computed are between two quadratic curves, and will necessarily be an integral or difference of integrals.\nThe primary parameters of the problem are formula_18, the tether length defined to be 160yds, and formula_19, the radius of the silo. There is no necessary relationship between formula_18 and formula_19, but here formula_22 is the radius of the circle whose circumference is formula_18. If one defines the point of tethering formula_24 (see diagram, above) as the origin with the circle representing the circumference of the pond below the \"x\"-axis, and formula_25 on the \"y\"-axis below the circle representing the point of intersection of the tether when wound clockwise and counterclockwise, let formula_26 be a point on the circle such that the tangent at formula_26 intersects formula_25, and formula_29 + formula_30 Is the length of the tether. Let formula_31 be the point of intersection of the circumference of the pond on the y-axis (opposite to formula_24) below the origin. Then let acute formula_33 be formula_11.\nThe area under the involute is a function of formula_35 because it is an integral over a quadratic curve. The area has a fixed boundary defined by the parameter formula_19 (i.e. the circumference of the silo). In this case the area is inversely proportional to formula_19, i.e. the larger formula_19, the smaller the area of the integral, and the circumference is a linear function of formula_19 (formula_40). So we seek an expression for the area under the involute formula_41.\nFirst, the area \"A\"1 is a half circle of radius formula_18 so formula_43\nNext, find the angle formula_11 which will be used in the limits of the integrals below. Let formula_45. formula_11 is complementary to the opposite angle of the triangle whose right angle is at point t; and also complementary to that angle in the third quadrant of the circle. formula_47 is the unrolled arc formula_48, so its arclength is formula_49. So formula_50 and formula_51, so formula_52. Finally,formula_53 and the following equation is obtained: formula_54. That is a transcendental equation that can only be solved by trial-and-error, polynomial expansion, or an iterative procedure like Newton\u2013Raphson. formula_55.\nNext compute the area between the circumference of the pond and involute. Compute the area in the tapering \"tail\" of the involute, i.e. the overlapped area (note, on account of the tangent \"tF\", that this area includes the wedge section, area \"A\"4, which will have to be added back in in the final summation). Recall that the area of a circular sector is formula_56 if the angle is in radians. Imagine an infinitely thin circular sector from formula_57 to formula_58 subtended by an infinitely small angle formula_59. Tangent to formula_57, there is a corresponding infinitely thin sector of the involute from formula_61 to formula_62 subtending the same infinitely small angle formula_59. The area of this sector is formula_64 where formula_65 is the radius at some angle formula_66, which is formula_67, the arc length of the circle so far \"unwrapped\" at angle formula_66. The area under the involute is the sum of all the infinitely many infinitely thin sectors formula_69 through some angle formula_70. This sum is\nThe bounds of the integral represent the area under the involute in the fourth quadrant between formula_17 and formula_73. The angle is measured on the circle, not on the involute, so it is less than formula_74 by some angle designated formula_11. formula_11 Is not given, and must be determined indirectly. Unfortunately, there is no way to simplify the latter term representing the lower bound of the eval expression because formula_11 is not a rational fraction of formula_78, so it may as well be substituted and evaluated at once (factoring out formula_78 preemptively): formula_80 which for expository reasons can be rewritten formula_81. It seems apropo to merge a factor of formula_82 into the constant term to get a common denominartor for the terms, so formula_83. formula_84 is dominated by a linear term from the integration, so may be written, formula_85 where formula_86 is a non-zero positive but negligible quantity.\n\"A\"4 is the area of the peculiar wedge formula_87. That area is the area of a right triangle with vertex t, minus the area of a sector bounded by formula_88. formula_89 where x is |tF| and \u03b8 is the angle opposite to \u03a6 in the right angle triangle. So, formula_90. If formula_91, then the area formula_92 of the wedge is formula_93 by reduction.\nThe final summation \"A\"1\u00a0+\u00a0(\"A\"2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"A\"3\u00a0+\u00a0\"A\"4)\u00a0\u00b7\u00a02 is formula_94. All imprecision in the calculation is now uncertainty in formula_11 and the residual formula_86. formula_97. That's useful for elucidating the relationships between the parameters. formula_11 is transcendental, so the definition is a recurrence relation. The initial guess formula_11 is a small fraction of formula_78. The numerical answer is formula_101 rounded up to the nearest square yard. It is worth noting that formula_102, which is the answer given for the case where the tether length is half the circumference (or any length such that formula_103) of the silo, or no overlap to account for. The goat can eat all but 5% of the area of the great circle defined by its tether length, and half the area it cannot eat is within the perimeter of the pond/silo. The only imprecision in the calculation is that no closed-form representation for formula_11 can be derived from the geometry presented. But small inaccuracies in formula_11 when formula_106 don't significantly affect the final result.\nSolution by ratio of arc length.\nJust as the area below a line is proportional to the length of the line between boundaries, and the area of a circular sector is a ratio of the arc length (formula_107) of the sector (formula_108), the area between an involute and its bounding circle is also proportional to the involute's arc lengthformula_109: formula_110 for formula_111. So the total grazing area is formula_112. formula_113. formula_114.formula_115.\nInterior grazing problem.\nLet formula_116 be the center of a unit circle. A goat/bull/horse is tethered at point formula_117 on the circumference. How long does the rope formula_19 need to be to allow the animal to graze on exactly one half of the circle's area (white area in diagram, in plane geometry, called a &lt;a href=\"lens%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;lens&lt;/a&gt;)?\nA useful approximation.\nThe analytical solutions are arduous and yield a transcendental formula, which must be iterated to produce a numerical approximation. A rough and quick approximation may be suitable for most practical applications and is obtainable by a few simple observations.\nFirst, a chord drawn through the center formula_116 of the enclosing circle perpendicular to the radius at formula_117 divides the area in half. A radius of the cutting circle equal to the radius of the enclosing circle (i.e. unit length) will sweep much but not all of the area below the chord. A radius of the cutting circle that reaches either end of the chord (i.e. length \u00a0\u2248\u00a01.414) will sweep out the entire area below the chord plus a thin &lt;a href=\"circular%20segment\"&gt;circular segment&lt;/a&gt; above the chord. So a plausible radius length is the mean of the two. But the swept area is expanding quadratically, not linearly, with the radius, so the &lt;a href=\"harmonic%20mean\"&gt;harmonic mean&lt;/a&gt; rather than the &lt;a href=\"arithmetic%20mean\"&gt;arithmetic mean&lt;/a&gt; is preferable, i.e. 1.189... This is accurate to within ~2.5% and quite usable in a practical situation, and the procedure is easy to replicate.\nA much better approximation may be had by the observation that the relationship between tether length and grazable area is substantially linear in the relevant range [1,\u00a0]:\nAt formula_122, the approximated tether length formula_19 is 1.15945, an error of just 0.06%.\nSolution by calculating the lens area.\nThe area reachable by the animal is in the form of an asymmetric &lt;a href=\"Lens%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;lens&lt;/a&gt;, delimited by the two &lt;a href=\"Arc%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;circular arcs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area formula_124 of a lens with two circles of radii formula_125 and distance between centers formula_126 is\nwhich simplifies in case of formula_128 and one half of the circle area to\nThe equation can only be solved &lt;a href=\"Iteration\"&gt;iteratively&lt;/a&gt; and results in formula_130 .\nSolution using integration.\nBy integrating over the right half of the lens area with\nthe transcendental equation\nfollows, with the same solution.\nClosed-form solution.\nBy using &lt;a href=\"complex%20analysis\"&gt;complex analysis&lt;/a&gt; methods, Ingo Ullisch obtained a closed-form solution as the cosine of a ratio of two &lt;a href=\"Contour%20integration\"&gt;contour integrals&lt;/a&gt;:\n3-dimensional extension.\nIn the three-dimensional case, point formula_117 lies on the surface of a &lt;a href=\"unit%20sphere\"&gt;unit sphere&lt;/a&gt;, and the problem is to find radius formula_19 of the second sphere so that the volume of the intersection body equals exactly half the volume of the unit sphere.\nThe volume of the unit sphere reachable by the animal has the form of a three-dimensional lens with differently shaped sides and defined by the two &lt;a href=\"spherical%20cap\"&gt;spherical cap&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe volume formula_136 of a lens with two spheres of radii formula_125 and distance between the centers formula_126 is\nwhich simplifies in case of formula_128 and one half of the sphere volume to\nleading to a solution of formula_142\nIt can be demonstrated that, with increasing dimensionality, the reachable area approaches one half the sphere at the critical length formula_143. If formula_144, the area covered approaches almost none of the sphere; if formula_145, the area covered approaches the sphere's entire area."
