    "text": "The University of Iceland ( ) is a &lt;a href=\"public%20university\"&gt;public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"research%20university\"&gt;research university&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; and the country's oldest and largest &lt;a href=\"institution%20of%20higher%20education\"&gt;institution of higher education&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 1911, it has grown steadily from a small civil servants' school to a modern &lt;a href=\"comprehensive%20university\"&gt;comprehensive university&lt;/a&gt;, providing instruction for about 14,000 students in twenty-five faculties. Teaching and research is conducted in &lt;a href=\"social%20sciences\"&gt;social sciences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"humanities\"&gt;humanities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"medicine\"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"natural%20sciences\"&gt;natural sciences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"teacher%20education\"&gt;teacher education&lt;/a&gt;. It has a campus concentrated around \"Su\u00f0urgata\" street in central Reykjav\u00edk, with additional facilities located in nearby areas as well as in the countryside.\nHistory.\nThe University of Iceland was founded by the &lt;a href=\"Al%C3%BEingi\"&gt;Al\u00feingi&lt;/a&gt; on June 17, 1911, uniting three former post-secondary institutions: \"Prestask\u00f3linn\", \"L\u00e6knask\u00f3linn\" and \"Lagask\u00f3linn\", which taught theology, medicine and law, respectively. The university originally had only faculties for these three fields, in addition to a faculty of &lt;a href=\"humanities\"&gt;humanities&lt;/a&gt;. During its first year of operation 45 students were enrolled. The first &lt;a href=\"Rector%20%28academia%29\"&gt;rector&lt;/a&gt; of the university was &lt;a href=\"Bj%C3%B6rn%20M.%20%C3%93lsen\"&gt;Bj\u00f6rn M. \u00d3lsen&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the faculty of humanities.\nThe university played an important role in the construction of the Icelandic nation-state and was perceived by Icelanders as an important stepping stone towards full independence. Demands for a national Icelandic university stretch as far back as to the first session of the elected assembly of Althingi in 1845. Icelandic nationalist leaders petitioned Denmark at the time to create a \"national school\" to achieve cultural and material progress, but also to make sure that the education that Icelanders obtained was sufficiently national in character.\nFor its first 29 years the university was housed in the Icelandic Parliament building, &lt;a href=\"Al%C3%BEingish%C3%BAsi%C3%B0\"&gt;Al\u00feingish\u00fasi\u00f0&lt;/a&gt;, in central &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;. In 1933, the university received a special licence from Al\u00feingi to operate a cash-prize lottery called \"Happdr\u00e6tti H\u00e1sk\u00f3lans\". The university lottery, which started in 1934, remains a major source of funding for the construction of new university buildings. In 1940, the university moved into the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Iceland%20A%C3%B0albygging\"&gt;main building&lt;/a&gt;, designed by Icelandic state architect &lt;a href=\"Gu%C3%B0j%C3%B3n%20Sam%C3%BAelsson\"&gt;Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n Sam\u00faelsson&lt;/a&gt;. The main building forms the core of the university campus on \"Su\u00f0urgata\", where most of the principal buildings of the university are located today.\nIn recent years there has been some major restructuring. In 2008 the university was divided into five different schools. Simultaneously, the &lt;a href=\"Iceland%20University%20of%20Education\"&gt;Iceland University of Education&lt;/a&gt; was merged with the University of Iceland to become its School of Education. Increased competition from local colleges has encouraged the university to greatly improve its marketing strategies, which had previously been deemed unnecessary.\nOn 21 January 2021, a broken main water pipe serving the &lt;a href=\"Vesturb%C3%A6r\"&gt;Vesturb\u00e6r&lt;/a&gt; neighbourhood of Reykjav\u00edk flooded the campus with over 2,000 tonnes of water, causing damage to buildings H\u00e1sk\u00f3latorg and Gimli.\nCampus.\nSchool buildings.\nThe university's main campus lies immediately south-west of &lt;a href=\"Tj%C3%B6rnin\"&gt;Tj\u00f6rnin&lt;/a&gt; lake in the centre of Reykjav\u00edk. It covers about 10 hectares in total. There are around 30 buildings in total, the oldest of which, &lt;a href=\"Gamli%20Gar%C3%B0ur\"&gt;Gamli Gar\u00f0ur&lt;/a&gt;, was built in 1934. The Main Building overlooks a semi-circular lawn, featuring a statue of &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A6mundur%20fr%C3%B3%C3%B0i\"&gt;S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i&lt;/a&gt;. In 2007, a new service centre was opened next to the main building and many of the most vital service desks were relocated there. Some lectures take place in H\u00e1sk\u00f3lab\u00ed\u00f3 cinema at the northern end of the campus. There are also a gym, several dormitories, and smaller research institute buildings on the grounds. Most buildings are located on the main campus and nearby neighbourhoods. The Faculty of Sport, Leisure Studies and Social Education, on the other hand, is located in the village of &lt;a href=\"Laugarvatn\"&gt;Laugarvatn&lt;/a&gt;.\nLibrary.\nIn 1994 the university library (formally established in 1940) merged with the national library of Iceland, \"Landsb\u00f3kasafn \u00cdslands\" (est. 1818) to form one large &lt;a href=\"academic%20library\"&gt;academic library&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20and%20University%20Library%20of%20Iceland\"&gt;National and University Library of Iceland&lt;/a&gt; (). The library main building, \"\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0arb\u00f3khla\u00f0an\", is situated next to the main campus.\nHospital.\nEducation and research at the University of Iceland are closely tied with the &lt;a href=\"Landsp%C3%ADtali\"&gt;National University Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Reykjav\u00edk. The facilities of the School of Health Sciences are therefore largely located on the hospital grounds.\nOrganisation.\nAdministration.\nThe University Council is the highest administrative authority within the institution and consists of the &lt;a href=\"Rector%20%28academia%29\"&gt;Rector&lt;/a&gt; and ten other members, including two students and two members endorsed by the University Forum. The University Forum consists of the Rector, faculty heads and various domestic representatives. It does not have any executive powers but works with the Council on the overall strategy of the university. The five academic schools and their faculties are headed by deans and have much control over curricula and day-to-day administration.\n&lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3n%20Atli%20Benediktsson\"&gt;J\u00f3n Atli Benediktsson&lt;/a&gt; is the current Rector of the University of Iceland. He took over from &lt;a href=\"Krist%C3%ADn%20Ing%C3%B3lfsd%C3%B3ttir\"&gt;Krist\u00edn Ing\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir&lt;/a&gt; in 2015.\nSchools and faculties.\nThe University of Iceland is divided into five \"schools\" (svi\u00f0) which are further divided into a total of twenty-five \"faculties\" (deildir). Prior to 2008, it was divided into eleven faculties which were then divided into \"departments\" (skorir). The largest current school is the School of Social Sciences with over 4,700 students, while each of the other four have around half that number. The university also operates a &lt;a href=\"Endurmenntun%20H%C3%A1sk%C3%B3la%20%C3%8Dslands\"&gt;continuing education centre&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe university consists of the following schools and faculties:\nInstitutes.\nThere are over sixty research institutes and seven rural research stations run by the university. Some of the most notable are:\nAcademics.\nIn addition to the major faculties there are numerous research institutes attached to the university. With more than 700 tenured teachers, over 2,000 non-tenured teachers and about 300 researchers and administrators, the University of Iceland is the largest single work-place in &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of the resources available at the university are uniquely Icelandic; these include the manuscripts preserved in the &lt;a href=\"%C3%81rni%20Magn%C3%BAsson%20Institute%20for%20Icelandic%20Studies\"&gt;\u00c1rni Magn\u00fasson Institute for Icelandic Studies&lt;/a&gt;, Icelandic census records dating from 1703, exceptionally complete genealogical data and climatological, glaciological, seismic and geothermal records.\nEducation.\nThe University of Iceland offers studies in more than 160 &lt;a href=\"undergraduate\"&gt;undergraduate&lt;/a&gt; programmes in the humanities, science and social sciences and in professional fields such as theology, law, business, medicine, &lt;a href=\"odontology\"&gt;odontology&lt;/a&gt;, nursing, pharmacology and engineering. &lt;a href=\"Postgraduate\"&gt;Postgraduate&lt;/a&gt; studies are offered by all faculties, most of them research-based although not exclusively. There are also several multidisciplinary master's programmes available in the fields of health and environmental sciences, some of them in cooperation with other European universities.\nThe principal language of instruction is &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20language\"&gt;Icelandic&lt;/a&gt;. Textbooks are mainly in &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and Icelandic. Most departments offer courses in English and allow foreign students to take their examinations in English. Icelandic language, medieval studies and environmental sciences are some of the university's strongest specialties, owing to Iceland's unique literary heritage and nature. A growing number of English-taught programmes are offered in these fields and others, attracting a large number of foreign students.\nRankings.\nIn 2011, \"&lt;a href=\"Times%20Higher%20Education\"&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/a&gt;\" included the University of Iceland for the first time, placing it in the 276-300 band globally. The following year it had risen to the 251-275 band on the same list. Currently, \"Times\" ranks the university among the 201-250 best in the world. The 2017 edition of &lt;a href=\"Academic%20Ranking%20of%20World%20Universities\"&gt;Academic Ranking of World Universities&lt;/a&gt; (ARWU) placed it in the 401-500 band globally.\nStudent life.\nStudent funding.\nThe University of Iceland is a public, government-funded university and as such it does not charge tuition (although an enrollment fee of 75,000 &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20kr%C3%B3na\"&gt;kr\u00f3na&lt;/a&gt; must be paid). In terms of living expenses, most students at the University of Iceland either work part-time to finance their studies or receive student loans at favourable interest rates from the &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20Student%20Loan%20Fund\"&gt;Icelandic Student Loan Fund&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Icelandic Ministry of Education, Science and Culture annually offers awards to foreign students for the study of &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20language\"&gt;Icelandic language&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20history\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20literature\"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Iceland. Scholarships are usually restricted to students from selected countries each year. Awards are tenable for one academic year and aim to cover board and lodging.\nThe major source of funding available to foreign graduate students is the &lt;a href=\"Eimskipaf%C3%A9lag%20%C3%8Dslands\"&gt;Eimskipaf\u00e9lag \u00cdslands&lt;/a&gt; University Fund, which is open to both scholars and current or prospective &lt;a href=\"PhD\"&gt;PhD&lt;/a&gt; students. Each grant from the fund is approximately 2.5 million &lt;a href=\"ISK\"&gt;ISK&lt;/a&gt; per year, for a period of up to three years and is intended to cover living expenses.\nStudent politics, unions and services.\nThe \"Students' Council\" is the official representative of those studying at the university. It handles all kinds of rights issues and relations with internal and external authorities. Elections for the council take place every year. There are three major parties that participate in the student politics. These are &lt;a href=\"Vaka%20%28University%20of%20Iceland%29\"&gt;Vaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"R%C3%B6skva%20%28University%20of%20Iceland%29\"&gt;R\u00f6skva&lt;/a&gt;. Many local politicians started their careers as members of the council.\nThere are over 60 student unions in operation within the university. Each union is made up of students of a particular subject or a few related ones. Postgraduate students in some fields have their own unions. Membership is optional. A large part of the unions' function revolves around social activities, the most common of which are the so-called \"science trips\", a tradition where companies and organizations in the industry invite students in a relevant field over for a presentation and drinks. Some postgraduate student unions also organize small-scale academic seminars.\nF\u00e9lagsstofnun st\u00fadenta is a self-owned institution that runs several services in and around the campus. These include kindergartens, low-rent apartments, cafeterias and a large bookstore."
