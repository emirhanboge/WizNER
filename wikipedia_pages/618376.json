    "text": "Elisha Nelson Manning (born January 3, 1981) is a former &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt; who played in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL) for 16 seasons with the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;. After playing &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Mississippi\"&gt;Ole Miss&lt;/a&gt;, he was selected &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20first%20overall%20National%20Football%20League%20draft%20picks\"&gt;first overall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2004 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20San%20Diego%20Chargers\"&gt;San Diego Chargers&lt;/a&gt; and traded to the Giants during the draft. He is the youngest son of former NFL quarterback &lt;a href=\"Archie%20Manning\"&gt;Archie Manning&lt;/a&gt; and younger brother of former NFL quarterback &lt;a href=\"Peyton%20Manning\"&gt;Peyton Manning&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Manning struggled with consistency throughout much of his career, he is recognized for twice leading the Giants to underdog &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; victories against the &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20Patriots\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"dynasty%20%28sports%29\"&gt;dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XLII\"&gt;Super Bowl XLII&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XLVI\"&gt;Super Bowl XLVI&lt;/a&gt;. The former, which saw the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20card%20%28sports%29\"&gt;wild card&lt;/a&gt; Giants defeat a Patriots team that was the first to win all 16 regular season games, is regarded as one of the greatest sports upsets of all time. Manning was named &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;Most Valuable Player&lt;/a&gt; in both championships, making him one of five players to have multiple Super Bowl MVP awards.\nAs the Giants' starting quarterback from 2004 to 2019, Manning holds the franchise records for &lt;a href=\"passing%20yards\"&gt;passing yards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"touchdown%20pass\"&gt;touchdown pass&lt;/a&gt;es, and completions. Never missing a game due to injury, he started 210 consecutive games from 2004 to 2017, the third-longest &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20most%20consecutive%20starts%20by%20a%20National%20Football%20League%20quarterback\"&gt;consecutive starts&lt;/a&gt; streak by an NFL quarterback. Manning ranks eighth all-time in passing yards and ninth in touchdowns.\nEarly life.\nManning was born in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest of three boys for Olivia (n\u00e9e Williams) and NFL quarterback &lt;a href=\"Archie%20Manning\"&gt;Elisha Archibald \"Archie\" Manning III&lt;/a&gt;, both natives of &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;. His older brothers, &lt;a href=\"Cooper%20Manning\"&gt;Cooper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peyton%20Manning\"&gt;Peyton&lt;/a&gt; were also quarterbacks.\nManning attended high school at the &lt;a href=\"Isidore%20Newman%20School\"&gt;Isidore Newman School&lt;/a&gt; in New Orleans, where he played &lt;a href=\"high%20school%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and basketball for the Greenies. In his high school career, Manning passed for 7,389 yards and 89 touchdowns. On February 7, 1999, he committed to play college football at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Mississippi\"&gt;University of Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollege career.\nManning entered college in the shadow of his brother Peyton, quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts, and his father, who was considered a \"folk hero\" at Ole Miss. During his years with the &lt;a href=\"Ole%20Miss%20Rebels%20football\"&gt;Rebels&lt;/a&gt;, Manning set or tied 45 single-game, &lt;a href=\"Season%20%28sports%29\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ole%20Miss%20Rebels%20football%20statistical%20leaders\"&gt;career records&lt;/a&gt;. His career numbers include 10,119 passing yards (fifth on the &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Conference\"&gt;SEC&lt;/a&gt; career list), 81 touchdown passes (third on the SEC career list), and a passer rating of 137.7 (tied for sixth on the SEC career list).\n2000 season.\nAs a freshman, Manning competed with veteran &lt;a href=\"Romaro%20Miller\"&gt;Romaro Miller&lt;/a&gt; for the starting quarterback position and saw little playing time. He appeared in six games and passed for 170 total yards and one interception.\n2001 season.\nWith the departure of Miller, Manning became the Rebels' starting quarterback as a sophomore. In the first game, against &lt;a href=\"Murray%20State%20Racers%20football\"&gt;Murray State&lt;/a&gt;, he converted 20-of-23 pass attempts for 271 yards and five passing touchdowns in the 49\u201314 victory. In the following game, a 27\u201321 loss to &lt;a href=\"2001%20Auburn%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Auburn&lt;/a&gt;, he had 265 passing yards, one passing touchdown and one interception. Over the next few games, Manning helped lead the Rebels to victories over &lt;a href=\"2001%20Kentucky%20Wildcats%20football%20team\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2001%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2001%20LSU%20Tigers%20football%20team\"&gt;LSU&lt;/a&gt;. On November 3, in a 58\u201356 loss to &lt;a href=\"2001%20Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20football%20team\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, Manning passed for 312 passing yards and six passing touchdowns. Overall, Manning had a solid first year as the Rebels' starting quarterback with 2,948 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, and nine interceptions, as the Rebels finished with a 7\u20134 record.\n2002 season.\nManning's junior season started out promising with a 31\u20133 victory over &lt;a href=\"2002%20Louisiana%E2%80%93Monroe%20Indians%20football%20team\"&gt;Louisiana-Monroe&lt;/a&gt; and a 38\u201316 victory over &lt;a href=\"2002%20Memphis%20Tigers%20football%20team\"&gt;Memphis&lt;/a&gt;. Manning had four passing touchdowns and one interception combined in those two games. In the next game, a 42\u201328 loss to &lt;a href=\"2002%20Texas%20Tech%20Red%20Raiders%20football%20team\"&gt;Texas Tech&lt;/a&gt;, Manning passed for 374 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. The Rebels won their next three games, which were over &lt;a href=\"2002%20Vanderbilt%20Commodores%20football%20team\"&gt;Vanderbilt&lt;/a&gt;, #6 &lt;a href=\"2002%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2002%20Arkansas%20State%20Indians%20football%20team\"&gt;Arkansas State&lt;/a&gt; to earn Ole Miss a #21 ranking in the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Poll\"&gt;AP Poll&lt;/a&gt;. Manning had five touchdowns and one interception in that stretch. The Rebels' fortunes turned in the latter half of the season with a five-game losing streak. In the stretch was a 48\u201328 loss to &lt;a href=\"2002%20Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20football\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, in which Manning completed 42-of-56 passes for 414 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions. In addition, he had a rushing touchdown. After a 24\u201312 win over &lt;a href=\"Egg%20Bowl\"&gt;rival&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2002%20Mississippi%20State%20Bulldogs%20football%20team\"&gt;Mississippi State&lt;/a&gt;, the Rebels qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Independence%20Bowl\"&gt;Independence Bowl&lt;/a&gt; with a 6\u20136 record to face off against &lt;a href=\"2002%20Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football%20team\"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;. Manning passed for 313 yards and one touchdown in the 27\u201323 victory. Overall, Manning finished with 3,401 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions in his junior season.\n2003 season.\nManning started off his senior season with a 2\u20132 record. He played well in that stretch with 1,329 passing yards, 11 touchdowns and four interceptions, with victories over &lt;a href=\"2003%20Vanderbilt%20Commodores%20football%20team\"&gt;Vanderbilt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2003%20Louisiana%E2%80%93Monroe%20Indians%20football%20team\"&gt;Louisiana-Monroe&lt;/a&gt;, but had losses to &lt;a href=\"2003%20Memphis%20Tigers%20football%20team\"&gt;Memphis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2003%20Texas%20Tech%20Red%20Raiders%20football%20team\"&gt;Texas Tech&lt;/a&gt;. The Rebels went on a six-game winning streak that included victories over major SEC opponents #24 &lt;a href=\"2003%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2003%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, #21 &lt;a href=\"2003%20Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20football%20team\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2003%20South%20Carolina%20Gamecocks%20football%20team\"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"2003%20Auburn%20Tigers%20football%20team\"&gt;Auburn&lt;/a&gt;. Manning passed for 1,552 yards, 12 touchdowns, and four interceptions in the winning streak. Overall, he led the Rebels to a 10\u20133 record, and a 31\u201328 &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20Inc.\"&gt;SBC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2003%20Cotton%20Bowl%20Classic\"&gt;Cotton Bowl Classic&lt;/a&gt; victory over #21 &lt;a href=\"2003%20Oklahoma%20State%20Cowboys%20football%20team\"&gt;Oklahoma State&lt;/a&gt;, with 259 passing yards and two touchdowns in 2003.\nAs his senior year came to a close, Manning won many awards, including the &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Award\"&gt;Maxwell Award&lt;/a&gt; as the nation's best all-around player, the &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Unitas%20Golden%20Arm%20Award\"&gt;Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20Foundation\"&gt;National Football Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;College Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; Scholar-Athlete Award, the &lt;a href=\"Yahoo%21%20Sports%20Radio\"&gt;Sporting News Radio&lt;/a&gt; Socrates Award, and the &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20Conference%20football%20individual%20awards%23Most%20Valuable%20Player\"&gt;SEC Most Valuable Player Award&lt;/a&gt;. He was also a candidate for the 2003 &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, finishing third in the voting after winning quarterback &lt;a href=\"Jason%20White%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Jason White&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football\"&gt;University of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;) and wide receiver &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;Larry Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football\"&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;). Manning was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Sigma%20Nu\"&gt;Sigma Nu&lt;/a&gt; fraternity (as was his father), and he was named Sigma Nu Athlete of the Year in 2001 and 2003.\nManning graduated from the University of Mississippi with a degree in &lt;a href=\"marketing\"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Grade%20%28education%29%23United%20States\"&gt;GPA&lt;/a&gt; of 3.44 and was on the Dean's Honor Roll.\nProfessional career.\nThe &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20San%20Diego%20Chargers\"&gt;San Diego Chargers&lt;/a&gt; had the first overall pick in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2004 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; due to their 4\u201312 record in 2003. With Manning being the most coveted player in the draft, it appeared that the Chargers' intentions were to draft him first overall. Meanwhile, Manning and his father Archie Manning stated that he would refuse to play for the Chargers if drafted by them. Archie Manning asked the father of former Chargers quarterback &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Leaf\"&gt;Ryan Leaf&lt;/a&gt; before the draft about his son's experience with the team. In hearing that the Chargers did not help Leaf with his personal problems, it then became part of why Eli refused to play for the team.\nThe Chargers selected Manning with the first pick overall nonetheless, as the team had a deal with the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;, whereby the Giants would draft and then trade &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Rivers\"&gt;Philip Rivers&lt;/a&gt; and a 2004 third-round pick, used to select placekicker &lt;a href=\"Nate%20Kaeding\"&gt;Nate Kaeding&lt;/a&gt;; a 2005 first-round pick, used to select linebacker &lt;a href=\"Shawne%20Merriman\"&gt;Shawne Merriman&lt;/a&gt;; and a 2005 fifth-round pick (which was later traded away) to the Chargers for Manning. He signed a six-year, $45 million contract with the Giants.\nManning was one of 17 quarterbacks taken in the 2004 NFL Draft, along with Rivers and the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Roethlisberger\"&gt;Ben Roethlisberger&lt;/a&gt;. All three would enjoy lengthy and successful careers with the teams that signed them and have been compared favorably to the &lt;a href=\"1983%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1983 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;, which included &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; quarterbacks &lt;a href=\"John%20Elway\"&gt;John Elway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Kelly\"&gt;Jim Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Marino\"&gt;Dan Marino&lt;/a&gt;. Manning posted the lowest passing yards, touchdowns, pass completions, completion percentage, TD\u2013INT ratio, passer rating, wins, winning percentage, and &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt; honors of the three, but cemented his legacy with his two upset &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; victories against the &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20Patriots\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"dynasty%20%28sports%29\"&gt;dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. While both Manning and Roethlisberger were part of two Super Bowl-winning teams, Manning is the only quarterback of the three to earn &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award\"&gt;Super Bowl MVP&lt;/a&gt; honors, which he received in both victories.\n2004 season: Rookie year.\nManning made his NFL regular season debut in Week 1 against the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;. He came into the game toward the end the fourth quarter in relief of &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Warner\"&gt;Kurt Warner&lt;/a&gt;. He finished the 31\u201317 loss 3-of-9 for 66 yards. Manning made his first career regular season start against the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season\"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Giants%20Stadium\"&gt;Giants Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on November 21, 2004. In the game, Manning threw his first career touchdown on a six-yard pass to &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Shockey\"&gt;Jeremy Shockey&lt;/a&gt; in the third quarter. In his fourth start, against the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Baltimore%20Ravens%20season\"&gt;Baltimore Ravens&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"M%26amp%3BT%20Bank%20Stadium\"&gt;M&amp;T Bank Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on December 12, 2004, he ended the day with a 0.0 passer rating and was benched in the second half in favor of Warner, but remained the Giants starter through the end of the season. In Week 15, against the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;, he recorded his first multi-touchdown performance with 182 passing yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in the 33\u201330 loss in a duel with fellow rookie quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. In the regular season finale, Manning passed for 144 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in the 28\u201324 victory over the &lt;a href=\"2004%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;, getting his first win as a starter. The Giants finished with a 6\u201310 record and were 1\u20136 in games that Manning started in. He finished with 1,043 passing yards, six touchdowns, and nine interceptions.\n2005 season: NFC East champions.\nFollowing 2004, Warner left the Giants, and Manning was named the starter for 2005. Manning led the Giants to a 2\u20130 record with victories against the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Arizona%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;Arizona Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2005%20New%20Orleans%20Saints%20season\"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt;, before traveling to the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;West Coast&lt;/a&gt; for a test in a road game against the &lt;a href=\"2005%20San%20Diego%20Chargers%20season\"&gt;San Diego Chargers&lt;/a&gt;. Chargers fans did not forget the snub, and on September 25, 2005, when Manning and the Giants made their first trip to San Diego for a game since that draft day, the crowd booed Manning loudly every time he touched the ball. San Diego defeated the Giants 45\u201323, but Manning displayed what may have been his most impressive performance of his young career, going 24-of-41 for 352 yards and two touchdowns.\nManning returned home to throw for almost 300 yards and a career-high four touchdowns against the &lt;a href=\"2005%20St.%20Louis%20Rams%20season\"&gt;St. Louis Rams&lt;/a&gt; at Giants Stadium in a 44\u201324 romp. Two games later, he led a last-minute drive against the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Denver%20Broncos%20season\"&gt;Denver Broncos&lt;/a&gt; to secure a 24\u201323 victory for the Giants. The drive culminated in a two-yard touchdown to &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Toomer\"&gt;Amani Toomer&lt;/a&gt; with five seconds remaining. Two weeks later, Manning overcame a weak first half against the &lt;a href=\"2005%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; to help his team secure their first official road victory of the season, 24\u20136. Despite a poor performance at home against the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Minnesota%20Vikings%20season\"&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/a&gt;, throwing four &lt;a href=\"interceptions\"&gt;interceptions&lt;/a&gt;, he again led his team back to tie the game in the final minutes before the Vikings won on a late field goal.\nManning finished among the top five quarterbacks in both passing yards and touchdown passes, while leading an offense that finished third in the NFL in scoring with a total of 422 points. It was the most points the Giants scored in a single season since &lt;a href=\"1963%20New%20York%20Giants%20season\"&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt;. The Giants won the &lt;a href=\"NFC%20East\"&gt;NFC East&lt;/a&gt; with an 11\u20135 record and advanced to the &lt;a href=\"Playoffs\"&gt;postseason&lt;/a&gt; as the #4-seed. In the against the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season\"&gt;Carolina Panthers&lt;/a&gt;, Manning was 10-of-18 for 113 yards and three interceptions in the 23\u20130 loss.\n2006 season.\nManning's second full season was reminiscent of his 2005 season. He started off playing well and completed over 65 percent of his passes through the first four games. However, he struggled in the second half of the season and his production diminished towards the end of the regular season. After losing a tough game to his brother Peyton and the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Indianapolis%20Colts%20season\"&gt;Indianapolis Colts&lt;/a&gt; on opening day, Manning and the Giants rebounded from a 24\u20137 fourth quarter deficit en route to a 30\u201324 overtime victory over the division rival &lt;a href=\"2006%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; in Week 2. Manning threw for a career-high 371 yards in the win with three touchdowns including a game-winning pass to &lt;a href=\"Plaxico%20Burress\"&gt;Plaxico Burress&lt;/a&gt; in overtime to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. Following a poor performance against the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Seattle%20Seahawks%20season\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt; the next week, Manning and the Giants responded by winning five straight games including wins over the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Washington%20Redskins%20season\"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2006%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2006%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season\"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt;, to push their record to 6\u20132.\nFollowing this winning streak, key injuries including one to wide receiver Amani Toomer pushed Manning and the Giants into a downward slide. Playing against the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Chicago%20Bears%20season\"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt;, Manning started well, but the Giants' offense was derailed by the loss of left tackle &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Petitgout\"&gt;Luke Petitgout&lt;/a&gt; to a broken leg. Manning was held to only 141 yards passing with two interceptions. Petitgout's loss left a gaping hole at the crucial left tackle position, and Manning was unable to repeat his first-half success. Manning struggled the next week against the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Jacksonville%20Jaguars%20season\"&gt;Jacksonville Jaguars&lt;/a&gt; and the week after that, a costly interception helped to culminate a huge collapse on the road against the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Tennessee%20Titans%20season\"&gt;Tennessee Titans&lt;/a&gt;, with the Giants seeing a 21-point fourth quarter lead simply evaporate. Manning improved the following week, throwing for 270 yards and two touchdowns against the Dallas Cowboys, but the Giants lost 23\u201320. Finally regaining momentum, Manning threw three touchdowns in a win on the road against the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season\"&gt;Carolina Panthers&lt;/a&gt;, but then he stumbled badly in the final three games. He threw two interceptions against the Philadelphia Eagles and tallied only 73 passing yards in a game against the &lt;a href=\"2006%20New%20Orleans%20Saints%20season\"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Giants battled back to 8\u20138 the following week on the road against the Washington Redskins, Manning completed only 12 of 26 passes for 101 yards and one touchdown. The Giants qualified for the postseason as the #6-seed and met the Philadelphia Eagles. Although he did significantly better in this game than the 2005 playoff game against the Carolina Panthers, completing 16 of 27 passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns, the Giants lost in the on a last-second field goal by the Eagles.\nFor the year, Manning threw for 3,244 yards, 24 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. He completed 57.7 percent of his passes, a five-point improvement from 2005, but he again struggled badly in the second half of the season. Manning finished the season with a quarterback efficiency rating of 77.0 (18th in the league) with 6.2 yards per attempt.\n2007 season: Super Bowl champions.\nManning trained in the Meadowlands with offensive coordinator &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Gilbride\"&gt;Kevin Gilbride&lt;/a&gt; and new quarterbacks coach Chris Palmer prior to the 2007 regular season. For the first time ever, Plaxico Burress and Jeremy Shockey practiced in the off-season with Manning to perfect their timing and chemistry rather than training alone in &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Orange%20Bowl\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; as they did in previous years.\n2007 regular season.\nManning opened the 2007 season with an outstanding personal performance against the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;, completing 28 of 41 passing attempts for 312 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception, but suffered a shoulder sprain and was removed from the game late in the second half. Although he did play against the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Green%20Bay%20Packers%20season\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; in Week 2 while throwing for 211 yards with one touchdown, the Giants defense performed poorly again and the team dropped to 0\u20132 with Green Bay winning, 35\u201313. In week three, Manning got a come-from-behind victory as the Giants defense improved, pitching a shutout in the second half and stopping the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Washington%20Redskins%20season\"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt; on a fourth and goal situation, winning the game 24\u201317. The Giants defense then shut down the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; with an NFL record-tying 12 &lt;a href=\"Quarterback%20sack\"&gt;sacks&lt;/a&gt;, holding the Eagles offense to one field goal. The Giants won with a score of 16\u20133. The following week, Manning overcame a dismal first half to throw for two second-half scores in a 35\u201324 win over their in-city rivals, the &lt;a href=\"2007%20New%20York%20Jets%20season\"&gt;New York Jets&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing two straight home victories, Manning and the Giants obtained their fourth consecutive victory with a 31\u201310 defeat of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season\"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Dome\"&gt;Georgia Dome&lt;/a&gt; on \"&lt;a href=\"Monday%20Night%20Football\"&gt;Monday Night Football&lt;/a&gt;\".

Behind a dominant defensive effort, the Giants improved to 5\u20132 the next week with a 33\u201315 win over the &lt;a href=\"2007%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt;. Manning played well again, throwing for two touchdowns in the effort. In week 8, the Giants played a road game against the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Miami%20Dolphins%20season\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; on October 28, 2007, in London's &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Manning only threw for 59 yards in the rain and mud, but he scored the Giants' only touchdown on a 10-yard run. This touchdown was the first in an NFL regular season game that was played outside of North America. The Giants defeated the Dolphins, 13\u201310, bringing the Giants to a 6\u20132 record at the mid-way point of the 2007 season. After losing to their division rivals the Dallas Cowboys in Week 9, New York Giants co-owner &lt;a href=\"John%20Mara\"&gt;John Mara&lt;/a&gt; publicly questioned Manning's ability to lead the Giants in 2007, but more importantly, in the future:\nAfter a week of criticism in the New York media and being outplayed by Cowboys quarterback &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Romo\"&gt;Tony Romo&lt;/a&gt;, Manning had a bounce-back victory against their conference Wild Card competitors the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Detroit%20Lions%20season\"&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt;. Manning threw for 283 yards and one touchdown but most importantly, no interceptions in a critical road game.\nThe following week in a 41\u201317 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Minnesota%20Vikings%20season\"&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/a&gt;, Manning threw four interceptions and had three of them returned for touchdowns. He continued to struggle until the last game of the season, &lt;a href=\"2007%20New%20England%20Patriots%E2%80%93New%20York%20Giants%20game\"&gt;against the 15\u20130&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2007%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt;. With a playoff spot secured, the Giants could have rested their starters for the playoffs, but they instead chose to keep in the regulars and attempt to stop New England's quest for an undefeated regular season. The Giants lost 38\u201335, with Manning completing 22 of 32 passes for 252 yards, with four touchdowns and one interception.\n2007 playoffs.\nThe Giants entered the playoffs as the #5-seed.

On a crucial third-and-5 at the Giants' 44-yard line, Manning connected with &lt;a href=\"David%20Tyree\"&gt;David Tyree&lt;/a&gt; on a play in which he avoided several &lt;a href=\"Quarterback%20sacks\"&gt;sacks&lt;/a&gt; and Tyree &lt;a href=\"Helmet%20Catch\"&gt;caught the ball off his helmet&lt;/a&gt; for a large gain. Four plays later, Plaxico Burress caught a 13-yard touchdown pass with just 35 seconds remaining for the winning margin. Manning became only the second quarterback in NFL history to throw two go-ahead fourth quarter touchdowns in a Super Bowl (&lt;a href=\"Joe%20Montana\"&gt;Joe Montana&lt;/a&gt; being the first in &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XXIII\"&gt;Super Bowl XXIII&lt;/a&gt; in 1989). Manning also became the first quarterback to throw a last-minute, championship-winning touchdown in the NFL title game (including the pre-Super Bowl era) when a field goal would not at least tie the game. \nManning was named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XLII. He and his brother Peyton are the only brother combination to play at quarterback in the Super Bowl and the only set of brothers to win Super Bowl MVP, doing so in successive years.\nFor winning Super Bowl MVP, he was given his choice of any 2008 model &lt;a href=\"Cadillac\"&gt;Cadillac&lt;/a&gt;, and Manning chose an &lt;a href=\"Cadillac%20Escalade%23Third%20generation\"&gt;Escalade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20vehicle\"&gt;Hybrid&lt;/a&gt;.

This victory secured Manning and the Giants a second trip in five years to the Super Bowl, setting up a highly anticipated Super Bowl XLII rematch against &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Brady\"&gt;Tom Brady&lt;/a&gt; and the New England Patriots. The Giants also made history as the first Super Bowl team ever outscored in the regular season (394 points scored, 400 points allowed).\nSuper Bowl XLVI.\nIn the most-watched program in the history of &lt;a href=\"television%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;United States television&lt;/a&gt;, Manning once again led the Giants to an upset victory over the -point-favored Patriots 21\u201317, his second Super Bowl win and the fourth overall for the franchise.\nWhile trailing the Patriots 15\u201317 in the final minutes, Manning led the Giants 88 yards down the field to a touchdown that many observers described as \"accidental\". With just over a minute of time left in the game, the Giants called a running play and Manning handed off the ball to Ahmad Bradshaw with the hopes of stopping short of the goal line and forcing the Patriots to use their final time out, thus allowing the Giants to run out the clock. The Patriots, in turn, did not attempt to tackle Bradshaw in his run, and he then fell over the goal line despite making an attempt to stop. However, the remaining time was not enough for Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to lead a comeback and the Giants held onto the lead to win. Manning was again named the Most Valuable Player of &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XLVI\"&gt;Super Bowl XLVI&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the third quarterback in a row to win the award. The Giants also became the first team ever with fewer than ten wins in a 16-game regular season to win the Super Bowl. Manning also became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for 4,900+ yards and win a Super Bowl in the same season. The Giants were the first team with a running game ranked last (32nd) and a defense ranked as low as 27th to win a Super Bowl.\nFor winning the Super Bowl, Manning and the Giants received a victory parade in &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; and were honored with symbolic keys to the city by &lt;a href=\"mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City\"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Bloomberg\"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. He was ranked 31st by his fellow players on the &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Top%20100%20Players%20of%202012\"&gt;NFL Top 100 Players of 2012&lt;/a&gt;.\n2012 season.\nThe Giants endured a disappointing season following their Super Bowl run in 2011. Manning led the Giants to a 6\u20132 record to begin &lt;a href=\"2012%20New%20York%20Giants%20season\"&gt;their season&lt;/a&gt;, including a career-best 510 passing yards to go along with three passing touchdowns and three interceptions in a Week 2 41\u201334 win over the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers%20season\"&gt;Tampa Bay Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;. He finished second only to Phil Simms's game with 513 passing yards in 1985 for the franchise record. However, Manning averaged an anemic 204 yards per game and 74.3 passer rating from Week 8 to Week 16, including his lowest rating in five years (38.9) in a 34\u20130 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season\"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt; in Week 15. He ended the &lt;a href=\"2012%20NFL%20season\"&gt;2012 season&lt;/a&gt; on a high note, throwing a career-high five &lt;a href=\"touchdown%20pass\"&gt;touchdown pass&lt;/a&gt;es while completing 13 of 21 pass attempts and passing for 208 yards with no &lt;a href=\"interception\"&gt;interception&lt;/a&gt;s, in a 42\u20137 Giants win over the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;. He finished the season with 26 touchdown passes, 15 interceptions and 3,948 &lt;a href=\"passing%20yards\"&gt;passing yards&lt;/a&gt;. As was typical for this phase of his career (2012\u20132016), Manning was exceptionally well-protected by his offensive line; he was sacked just 19 times for a league-lowest 3.4% of passing plays. Although the Giants did not qualify for the playoffs with a 9\u20137 season, Manning was selected to his third &lt;a href=\"2013%20Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt; as a second alternate.\n2013 season.\nManning started the 2013 season off with 450 passing yards, four touchdowns and three interceptions in a 36\u201331 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Dallas%20Cowboys\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;. Manning set a franchise record for most passing yards in a season opener, breaking Phil Simms's mark of 409 passing yards in the 1984 regular season opener. The loss was a sign of things to come as the Giants started the season with an 0\u20136 record, their worst regular season start since 1976. He threw 12 interceptions in his first five games. Manning fell to 0\u20133 against his older brother, Peyton in Week 2's 41\u201323 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Denver%20Broncos%20season\"&gt;Denver Broncos&lt;/a&gt;. He was 28 of 39 for 362 yards, but was intercepted four times. Manning's four interceptions tied his career high and was the fourth time he threw four interceptions in a game. The game between Peyton and Eli was the final professional meeting of the two brothers. In Week 15, Manning threw for 156 yards and a career-high five interceptions in a 23\u20130 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Seattle%20Seahawks%20season\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt;. Manning ended the season with a career-high 27 interceptions, which were the most in one season by a quarterback since &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Favre\"&gt;Brett Favre&lt;/a&gt; had 29 in 2005. The Giants finished the season 7\u20139, their first losing record since Manning's rookie year in 2004.\nManning passed Phil Simms to become the franchise's all-time leader in yards passing. Simms, who played 14 seasons with the Giants, finished his career with 33,462 yards in the air. He was ranked 43rd by his fellow players on the &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Top%20100%20Players%20of%202014\"&gt;NFL Top 100 Players of 2014&lt;/a&gt;.\n2014 season.\nAfter an 0\u20132 start, the Giants won three straight games but subsequently lost their next seven games including a 16\u201310 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2014%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; in a game where Manning threw five interceptions, which tied his career high. The Giants won three of their last four games to end the season with a 6\u201310 record. Among Manning's highlights from the losing season was a Week 17 game where he had 429 passing yards, one touchdown and one interception in a 34\u201326 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;. Manning finished the season with 30 touchdown passes, 14 interceptions and 4,410 passing yards.\n2015 season.\nA few days before the Giants' regular season opener against the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;, Manning signed a four-year, US$84million extension with the Giants. In Week 5, he had a franchise-record 41 completions for 441 passing yards, three touchdowns and one interception, in a 30\u201327 victory over the &lt;a href=\"2015%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. Through six games, he led the Giants to a 3\u20133 record and a tie for first place in the NFC East. In Week 8, Manning threw a career-high six touchdowns and 350 yards, but the Giants lost to the &lt;a href=\"2015%20New%20Orleans%20Saints%20season\"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt;, 52\u201349. He became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for six touchdowns and no interceptions in a game and lose. In Week 10, in a narrow 27\u201326 loss to the undefeated &lt;a href=\"2015%20New%20England%20Patriots\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt;, Manning passed for 361 yards and two touchdowns, one of which was an 87-yard strike to &lt;a href=\"Odell%20Beckham%20Jr.\"&gt;Odell Beckham Jr.&lt;/a&gt; in the first quarter. In Week 14, in a 31\u201324 victory over the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Miami%20Dolphins%20season\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, he was 27-of-31 for 337 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. After starting the season 5\u20135, Giants fell to 1\u20135 the rest of the way to finish 6\u201310 for the second straight season. Manning's longtime coach in &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Coughlin\"&gt;Tom Coughlin&lt;/a&gt; stepped down at the end of the season.\nManning finished the 2015 season with career highs in touchdown passes (35), completions (387), attempts (618) and passer rating (93.6). His 35 touchdowns were one shy of tying &lt;a href=\"Y.%20A.%20Tittle\"&gt;Y. A. Tittle&lt;/a&gt; for most in a single season in franchise history and ranked second among quarterbacks that year. Manning also threw 4,432 yards in 2015, second most in his career. On January 22, 2016, Manning was selected to his fourth career Pro Bowl, replacing Ben Roethlisberger. Manning's fourth Pro Bowl berth ties &lt;a href=\"Fran%20Tarkenton\"&gt;Fran Tarkenton&lt;/a&gt; for most Pro Bowl selections by a New York Giants quarterback in franchise history. He was ranked 47th by his fellow players on the &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Top%20100%20Players%20of%202016\"&gt;NFL Top 100 Players of 2016&lt;/a&gt;.\n2016 season: Return to the playoffs.\nManning had a new head coach in &lt;a href=\"Ben%20McAdoo\"&gt;Ben McAdoo&lt;/a&gt; for the 2016 season. In the regular-season opener against their divisional rival &lt;a href=\"2016%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; on September 11, Manning threw three touchdowns and one interception for 207 yards, as the Giants would hang on to win 20\u201319. On October 16, in a victory over the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Ravens\"&gt;Baltimore Ravens&lt;/a&gt;, Manning threw for three touchdowns, reaching a career total of 302 touchdown passes and passing John Elway for seventh all time.\nComing off a bye week and on a two-game winning streak, beating the Ravens and the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Los%20Angeles%20Rams%20season\"&gt;Los Angeles Rams&lt;/a&gt;, Manning threw a season-high four touchdowns as the Giants would halt a last-second game-winning drive by the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt; to win 28\u201323. In a Week 16 loss against the Eagles on December 22, Manning set a franchise record with 63 pass attempts in a single game, while throwing one touchdown and three interceptions, surpassing Peyton Manning's record of 21 games with at least three interceptions with 22. Despite the loss, though, the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers%20season\"&gt;Tampa Bay Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; lost to the &lt;a href=\"2016%20New%20Orleans%20Saints%20season\"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt; later that week 31\u201324, giving the Giants their first playoff berth since the 2011 season, when the team last won the Super Bowl.\nBy defeating the rival &lt;a href=\"2016%20Washington%20Redskins%20season\"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt; in the final week of the NFL season on New Year's Day and, therefore, knocking the Redskins out of playoff contention and bringing their season record to 11\u20135 (their first winning season since 2012), Manning and the Giants faced the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Green%20Bay%20Packers%20season\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lambeau%20Field\"&gt;Lambeau Field&lt;/a&gt; in the of the NFL playoffs, as Manning completed 23 of 44 of his passes for 299 yards, while throwing for a touchdown. Manning was back to his playoff self in the game, but was let down by numerous drops by Odell Beckham Jr., and other star playmakers. The Packers would eventually rout the Giants 38\u201313, ending the Giants' season. Manning finished the season recording 4,027 passing, 26 touchdowns and 16 interceptions, with an 86.0 passer rating.\nOn February 4, 2017, Manning and Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald both won the &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Payton%20NFL%20Man%20of%20the%20Year%20Award\"&gt;Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award&lt;/a&gt;, making it the first time since the 2006 season that two players were co-winners of this award (&lt;a href=\"Drew%20Brees\"&gt;Drew Brees&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"LaDainian%20Tomlinson\"&gt;LaDainian Tomlinson&lt;/a&gt;).\n2017 season.\nManning started the 2017 season off with a 19\u20133 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; on \"NBC Sunday Night Football\". In the game, he had 220 passing yards, but the offense struggled to sustain consistent success. Despite solid performances from Manning, the Giants dropped the next four games to start the season with a 0\u20135 record, with the last three games of that stretch being lost by a combined 10 points. The Giants broke their losing streak with a 23\u201310 victory over the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Denver%20Broncos%20season\"&gt;Denver Broncos&lt;/a&gt;. The success was short-lived as the Giants lost the next game to the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Seattle%20Seahawks%20season\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 24\u20137. During Week 9 against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Los%20Angeles%20Rams%20season\"&gt;Los Angeles Rams&lt;/a&gt;, Manning finished with 220 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the Giants lost by a score of 51\u201317. During the Rams game, he became the seventh quarterback to reach 50,000 passing yards. On November 28, after a 2\u20139 start to the season, it was announced that Manning would be benched and replaced by &lt;a href=\"Geno%20Smith\"&gt;Geno Smith&lt;/a&gt; in Week 13 against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Oakland%20Raiders%20season\"&gt;Oakland Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, ending Manning's streak of 210 consecutive regular-season games started. The streak was second all-time for quarterbacks behind Brett Favre's 297. Head coach Ben McAdoo gave Manning the option of starting to keep the streak going but Manning declined, stating that \"My feeling is that if you are going to play the other guys, play them. Starting just to keep the streak going and knowing you won't finish the game and have a chance to win it is pointless to me, and it tarnishes the streak.\" The move was met with backlash from former Giants players and coaches. On December 5, two days after the Week 13 game, Manning was renamed the starter by interim head coach &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Spagnuolo\"&gt;Steve Spagnuolo&lt;/a&gt;, after McAdoo was fired as head coach. During Week 15 against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;, Manning finished with 434 passing yards, three touchdowns and an interception. The Giants lost 34\u201329, allowing the Eagles to clinch a first-round bye. On December 24, against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Arizona%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;Arizona Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, Manning passed John Elway to take sole possession of sixth place on the NFL's all-time passing yard list. Manning started the regular-season finale against the Washington Redskins. In the 18\u201310 victory, he had 132 passing yards, one touchdown and one interception, as the Giants ended their disappointing season with a 3\u201313 record.\n2018 season.\nFollowing speculation that Manning would be released, new Giants head coach &lt;a href=\"Pat%20Shurmur\"&gt;Pat Shurmur&lt;/a&gt; put these rumors aside by saying \"I think what's important is we have a guy here who has helped this organization win Super Bowls. He's an outstanding player and I'm really looking forward to working with him.\"\nAfter losses to the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Jacksonville%20Jaguars%20season\"&gt;Jacksonville Jaguars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2018%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; to the start the season, Manning and the Giants defeated the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Houston%20Texans%20season\"&gt;Houston Texans&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 27\u201322. Manning was efficient going 25-of-29 for 297 passing yards and two touchdowns. The Giants lost the next five consecutive games, with Manning leading the leagues in sacks for most of that stretch despite an improved running game from rookie &lt;a href=\"Saquon%20Barkley\"&gt;Saquon Barkley&lt;/a&gt;. Manning had 399 yards passing in the fourth of these losses (Game 7 against the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season\"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt;), but was sacked seven times and threw two interceptions in Game 8. Manning rebounded with three touchdowns and no interceptions in the following week's victory over the &lt;a href=\"2018%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt;, and a remarkable 17 completions on 18 attempts for two touchdowns in a win the following week over the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers%20season\"&gt;Tampa Bay Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;. The Giants went 4\u20134 over the last eight games of the season to finish 5\u201311 and last in the NFC East. Manning passed for 4,299 yards, 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in the 2018 season.\n2019 season: Final year.\nThe 2019 season was Manning's last remaining year on his contract. While the Giants had the option to release Manning in the offseason and save $17 million in both cash and cap space, the team opted to keep him on their roster. However, neither side held any discussions for a contract extension, causing doubt for Manning's future as the Giants' franchise quarterback beyond the upcoming season. The team selected quarterback &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Jones%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Daniel Jones&lt;/a&gt; in the first round of &lt;a href=\"2019%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;that year's draft&lt;/a&gt;, which many saw as the Giants selecting Manning's successor while further cementing his own lame-duck status in the position. Manning was informed of the Giants' decision during their draft selection. Despite the pick, General Manager &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Gettleman\"&gt;Dave Gettleman&lt;/a&gt; said \"the goal is for Eli to be our quarterback\", while head coach Shurmur told Manning \"it's your job to win games and keep [Jones] off the field\".\nBeing on the Giants' roster meant that it would be Manning's 16th season with the team, marking a franchise record for the longest tenure for any player in its 94-year history. Manning started the Giants' first two games of the season, passing for 306 yards and a touchdown in a 35\u201317 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; and 250 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions in a 28\u201314 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season\"&gt;Buffalo Bills&lt;/a&gt;. On September 17, 2019, the Giants announced that Manning would not start the team's Week 3 game against the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers%20season\"&gt;Tampa Bay Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, instead opting for Jones. This was thought to be the end of Manning's time as the Giants' starting quarterback. \nDue to an injury suffered by Jones during Week 13 against the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Green%20Bay%20Packers%20season\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt;, Manning returned to the starting lineup the next week on December 9 against the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;. During the game, Manning threw for 203 yards and two touchdowns to rookie wide receiver &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Slayton\"&gt;Darius Slayton&lt;/a&gt;, but the game ended in a 23\u201317 overtime loss for the Giants. As the game was televised on \"Monday Night Football\", it marked Manning's final primetime appearance. In the following week's game against the &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Dolphins\"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; at home, Manning started again and threw for 283 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions, leading the team to a 36\u201320 win. As the game ended, Manning was taken off the field and received a standing ovation from fans who believed this was his final home game as the starting quarterback. Jones returned to action in Week 16 and Manning's season was over. Manning finished the year with 1,042 passing yards, six touchdowns and five interceptions in four games, as the Giants finished the season 4\u201312.\nWith his contract expiring at the end of the season, Manning was set to become a free agent for the first time in his career. When discussing his future plans, Manning stated that he did not wish to be a backup quarterback or pursue coaching opportunities with the team, as he felt he served both roles throughout the year and did not enjoy either one of them. Regardless, he said he would weigh his options for the upcoming season, stating \"I think I can still play\". During a radio interview weeks later, team co-owner &lt;a href=\"John%20Mara\"&gt;John Mara&lt;/a&gt; said that the Giants would welcome back Manning the next year as a backup quarterback or in a front-office role, but that newly-hired head coach &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Judge%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Joe Judge&lt;/a&gt; would need to give his approval to include Manning on the roster.\nRetirement and honors.\nOn January 22, 2020, Manning announced his retirement, with an official press conference scheduled for January 24. John Mara stated during the press conference that Manning would be inducted into the Giants Ring of Honor in 2020 and that Manning's number 10 jersey would be &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20National%20Football%20League%20retired%20numbers\"&gt;retired&lt;/a&gt;.\nManning rejoined the Giants in 2021 in a business operations and fan engagement role, according to the team. His jersey retirement and induction into the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants%23Ring%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Giants' Ring of Honor&lt;/a&gt; took place on September 26, 2021 at halftime of the Giants-&lt;a href=\"Atlanta%20Falcons\"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt; game at &lt;a href=\"Metlife%20Stadium\"&gt;Metlife Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. He will be eligible for &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; induction in 2025.\nPost-playing career.\nManning joined &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; as an NFL analyst for the 2021 season, calling nine games during the season. In addition, he currently hosts \"Eli's Places\" for &lt;a href=\"ESPN%2B\"&gt;ESPN+&lt;/a&gt;, where he \"travel[s] to some of the most well-known and historic college football establishments and meet with giants in the sport to better understand what makes college football such a national sensation.\" He also received a nickname \"Human Carbon Monoxide\" or HCM from &lt;a href=\"Dwayne%20Johnson\"&gt;The Rock&lt;/a&gt; due to him not having a nickname unlike his brother &lt;a href=\"Peyton%20Manning\"&gt;Peyton Manning&lt;/a&gt; and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.\nOther ventures.\nEli co-starred with his brother Peyton in ads for &lt;a href=\"NFLShop.com\"&gt;NFLShop.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oreo\"&gt;Oreo&lt;/a&gt;.\nEli is a spokesman for &lt;a href=\"Citizen%20Watch%20Co.\"&gt;Citizen Watch Co.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toyota\"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; of New Jersey, and &lt;a href=\"Reebok\"&gt;Reebok&lt;/a&gt;. He reportedly received several more endorsement offers after reaching &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XLII\"&gt;Super Bowl XLII&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn May 5, 2012, Eli hosted &lt;a href=\"National%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20Live%20%28season%2037%29%23Episodes\"&gt;\"Saturday Night Live\"&lt;/a&gt; (season 37, episode 20), with musical guest &lt;a href=\"Rihanna\"&gt;Rihanna&lt;/a&gt;. His brother Peyton hosted the show five years earlier.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2007, he proposed to Abby McGrew of &lt;a href=\"Nashville%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Nashville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;. McGrew studied fashion in New York City, and has been with Manning since their days at the University of Mississippi. The couple wed in a private ceremony held in &lt;a href=\"San%20Jos%C3%A9%20del%20Cabo\"&gt;San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo, Mexico&lt;/a&gt; on April 19, 2008. Manning and Abby have three daughters and a son. They reside in &lt;a href=\"Summit%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Summit, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;.\nEli and Peyton Manning volunteered in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Katrina\"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. The Mannings assisted in the delivery of of water, Gatorade, baby formula, pumice, and pillows to the people of New Orleans. After touring the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Mississippi%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;University of Mississippi Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;'s Blair E.
