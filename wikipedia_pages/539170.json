    "text": "Baltistan (, ), also known as Baltiyul or Little Tibet (), is a mountainous region in the &lt;a href=\"Gilgit-Baltistan\"&gt;Gilgit-Baltistan&lt;/a&gt; portion of Pakistan-administered &lt;a href=\"Kashmir\"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;. It is located near the &lt;a href=\"Karakoram\"&gt;Karakoram&lt;/a&gt; mountains just south of &lt;a href=\"K2\"&gt;K2&lt;/a&gt; (the world's second-highest mountain), and borders &lt;a href=\"Gilgit\"&gt;Gilgit&lt;/a&gt; to the west, China's &lt;a href=\"Xinjiang\"&gt;Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Ladakh\"&gt;Ladakh&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast, and the &lt;a href=\"Kashmir%20Valley\"&gt;Kashmir Valley&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest. Its average altitude is over . The modern administrative region is the &lt;a href=\"Baltistan%20Division\"&gt;Baltistan Division&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to 1947, Baltistan was part of the princely state of &lt;a href=\"Jammu%20and%20Kashmir%20%28princely%20state%29\"&gt;Jammu and Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;, having been conquered by Raja &lt;a href=\"Gulab%20Singh\"&gt;Gulab Singh&lt;/a&gt;'s armies in 1840. Baltistan and Ladakh were administered jointly under one \"wazarat\" (district) of the state. Baltistan retained its identity in this set-up as the &lt;a href=\"Skardu\"&gt;Skardu&lt;/a&gt; \"tehsil\", with Kargil and Leh being the other two \"tehsils\" of the district. After the &lt;a href=\"Hari%20Singh\"&gt;Maharaja&lt;/a&gt; of Jammu and Kashmir &lt;a href=\"Instrument%20of%20Accession\"&gt;acceded&lt;/a&gt; to India, &lt;a href=\"Gilgit%20Scouts\"&gt;Gilgit Scouts&lt;/a&gt; overthrew the Maharaja's governor in Gilgit and captured Baltistan. The &lt;a href=\"Gilgit%20Agency\"&gt;Gilgit Agency&lt;/a&gt; and Baltistan have been governed by Pakistan ever since. The &lt;a href=\"Kashmir%20Valley\"&gt;Kashmir Valley&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kargil%20district\"&gt;Kargil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leh%20district\"&gt;Leh&lt;/a&gt; \"tehsils\" were retained by India. The Baltistan entire region is under Pakistan control except 4 small rugged and dried mountainous villages of Baltistan region, where small Balti community still exists, including the village of &lt;a href=\"Turtuk\"&gt;Turtuk&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nubra%20Valley\"&gt;Nubra Valley&lt;/a&gt;, was incorporated into Ladakh after the &lt;a href=\"Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201971\"&gt;Indo-Pakistani War of 1971&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region is inhabited primarily by &lt;a href=\"Balti%20people\"&gt;Balti people&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20people\"&gt;Tibetan&lt;/a&gt; descent. The vast majority of the population follows &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;. Baltistan is strategically significant to Pakistan and India; the &lt;a href=\"Kargil%20War\"&gt;Kargil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Siachen%20conflict\"&gt;Siachen War&lt;/a&gt;s were fought there.\nGeography.\nThe 1911 &lt;a href=\"Encyclopaedia%20Britannica%20Eleventh%20Edition\"&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/a&gt; characterises Baltistan as the western extremity of &lt;a href=\"Tibet\"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;, whose natural limits are the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20River\"&gt;Indus River&lt;/a&gt; from its abrupt southward bend around the map point and the mountains to the north and west. These features separate a comparatively peaceful Tibetan population from the fiercer &lt;a href=\"Indo-Aryan%20peoples\"&gt;Indo-Aryan&lt;/a&gt; tribes to the west. &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; writers around the 16th century speak of Baltistan as the \"Little Tibet\", and of &lt;a href=\"Ladakh\"&gt;Ladakh&lt;/a&gt; as the \"Great Tibet\", emphasising their &lt;a href=\"ethnological\"&gt;ethnological&lt;/a&gt; similarity. According to Ahmad Hassan Dani, Baltistan spreads upwards from the Indus river and is separated from Ladakh by the &lt;a href=\"Siachen%20Glacier\"&gt;Siachen Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. It includes the Indus valley and the lower valley of the &lt;a href=\"Shyok%20river\"&gt;Shyok river&lt;/a&gt;.\nBaltistan is a rocky mass of lofty mountains, the prevailing formation being &lt;a href=\"gneiss\"&gt;gneiss&lt;/a&gt;. In the north is the &lt;a href=\"Baltoro%20Glacier\"&gt;Baltoro Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, the largest out of the &lt;a href=\"arctic\"&gt;arctic&lt;/a&gt; regions, long, contained between two ridges whose highest peaks to the south are and to the north .\nThe Indus river runs in a narrow &lt;a href=\"Canyon\"&gt;gorge&lt;/a&gt;, widening after receiving the &lt;a href=\"Shyok\"&gt;Shyok&lt;/a&gt; river at . It then forms a crescent-shaped plain varying between wide. The main inhabitable valleys of &lt;a href=\"Kharmang\"&gt;Kharmang&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khaplu\"&gt;Khaplu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skardu\"&gt;Skardu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roundu\"&gt;Roundu&lt;/a&gt; are along the routes of these rivers.\nValleys and districts.\n\u00b0Although under Indian control since 1971, geographically, the Turtuk part of Shyok Valley, is part of Baltistan region.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nToday, the people of &lt;a href=\"Kharmang\"&gt;Kharmang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chorbat%20Valley\"&gt;Western Khaplu&lt;/a&gt; have Tibetan features and those in Skardu, &lt;a href=\"Shigar\"&gt;Shigar&lt;/a&gt; and the eastern villages of Khaplu are &lt;a href=\"Dard%20people\"&gt;Dards&lt;/a&gt;. It was believed that the Balti people were in the sphere of influence of &lt;a href=\"Zhangzhung\"&gt;Zhangzhung&lt;/a&gt;. Baltistan was controlled by the Tibetan king in 686. Culturally influenced by Tibet, the &lt;a href=\"Bon\"&gt;Bon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Animism\"&gt;animist&lt;/a&gt; Baltis began to adopt &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20Buddhism\"&gt;Tibetan Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;. Religious artifacts such as \"&lt;a href=\"gompa\"&gt;gompa&lt;/a&gt;s\" and \"&lt;a href=\"stupa\"&gt;stupa&lt;/a&gt;s\" were built, and &lt;a href=\"lama\"&gt;lama&lt;/a&gt;s played an important role in Balti life.\nFor centuries, Baltistan consisted of small, independent valley states connected by the blood relationships of its rulers (\"&lt;a href=\"raja\"&gt;raja&lt;/a&gt;s\"), trade, common beliefs and cultural and linguistic bonds. Baltistan was known as Little Tibet, and the name was extended to include Ladakh. Ladakh later became known as Great Tibet. Locally, Baltistan is known as \"Baltiyul\" and Ladakh and Baltistan are known as Maryul (\"red country\").\nIn 1190, &lt;a href=\"Maqpon%20dynasty\"&gt;Maqpon dynasty&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skardu\"&gt;Skardu&lt;/a&gt; was founded by Ibrahim Shah (1190-1220), who was born in &lt;a href=\"Skardu\"&gt;Skardu&lt;/a&gt;. This royal family ruled over &lt;a href=\"Baltistan\"&gt;Baltistan&lt;/a&gt; for approximately 700 years. The kings of the Maqpon dynasty extended the frontiers of Baltistan to &lt;a href=\"Gilgit%20Agency\"&gt;Gilgit Agency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chitral\"&gt;Chitral&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ladakh\"&gt;Ladakh&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 14th century, Muslim scholars from Kashmir crossed Baltistan's mountainous terrain to spread Islam. The &lt;a href=\"Noorbakshia%20Islam\"&gt;Noorbakshia&lt;/a&gt; Sufi order further propagated the faith in Baltistan and Islam became dominant by the end of the 17th century. With the passage of time a large number also converted to &lt;a href=\"Shia%20Islam\"&gt;Shia Islam&lt;/a&gt; and a few converted to &lt;a href=\"Sunni\"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; Islam.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kharmang\"&gt;Kharmang&lt;/a&gt; came under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Namgyal%20dynasty%20of%20Ladakh\"&gt;Namgyal royal family&lt;/a&gt; and developed a close relationship with Ladakh when the \"raja\" of Ladakh, Jamyang Mangyal, attacked the principalities in Kargil. Mangyal annihilated the Skardu garrison at Kharbu and put to the sword a number of petty Muslim rulers in the principalities of Purik (Kargil). &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Sher%20Khan%20Anchan\"&gt;Ali Sher Khan Anchan&lt;/a&gt;, \"raja\" of &lt;a href=\"Khaplu\"&gt;Khaplu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shigar\"&gt;Shigar&lt;/a&gt;, left with a strong army via &lt;a href=\"Marol\"&gt;Marol&lt;/a&gt;. Passing the Laddakhi army, he occupied &lt;a href=\"Leh\"&gt;Leh&lt;/a&gt; (the capital of Ladakh) and the \"raja\" of Ladakh was taken prisoner.\nAli Sher Khan Anchan included Gilgit and &lt;a href=\"Chitral\"&gt;Chitral&lt;/a&gt; in his kingdom of Baltistan, reportedly a flourishing country. The valley from Khepchne to Kachura was flat and fertile, with abundant fruit trees; the sandy desert now extending from Sundus to &lt;a href=\"Skardu%20Airport\"&gt;Skardu Airport&lt;/a&gt; was a prosperous town. Skardu had hardly recovered from the shock of the death of Anchan when it was flooded. \nIn 1845, the region was subjugated by the &lt;a href=\"Dogra\"&gt;Dogra&lt;/a&gt; rulers of &lt;a href=\"Kashmir\"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn 29 August 2009 the government of &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; announced the creation of Gilgit\u2013Baltistan, a provincial autonomous region with &lt;a href=\"Gilgit\"&gt;Gilgit&lt;/a&gt; as its capital and &lt;a href=\"Skardu\"&gt;Skardu&lt;/a&gt; its largest city.\nTourism.\nSkardu has several tourist resorts and many natural features, including plains, mountains and mountain-valley lakes. The &lt;a href=\"Deosai%20National%20Park\"&gt;Deosai plain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Satpara%20Lake\"&gt;Satpara Lake&lt;/a&gt; and Basho also host tourists. North of Skardu, the Shigar Valley offers plains, hiking tracks, peaks and campsites. Other valleys in Baltistan region are &lt;a href=\"Khaplu\"&gt;Khaplu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roundu%20Baltistan\"&gt;Rondu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kachura%20Lake\"&gt;Kachura Lake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kharmang\"&gt;Kharmang&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlaciers.\nBaltistan is a rocky wilderness of around , with the largest cluster of mountains in the world and the biggest &lt;a href=\"glacier\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt;s outside the polar regions. The &lt;a href=\"Himalayas\"&gt;Himalayas&lt;/a&gt; advance into this region from India, Tibet and Nepal, and north of them are the Karakoram range. Both ranges run northwest, separated by the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20River\"&gt;Indus River&lt;/a&gt;. Along the Indus and its tributaries are many valleys. Glaciers include &lt;a href=\"Baltoro%20Glacier\"&gt;Baltoro Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Biafo%20Glacier\"&gt;Biafo Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siachen%20Glacier\"&gt;Siachen Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trango%20Glacier\"&gt;Trango Glacier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Godwin-Austen%20Glacier\"&gt;Godwin-Austen Glacier&lt;/a&gt;.\nMountaineering.\nBaltistan is home to more than 20 peaks of over , including &lt;a href=\"K2\"&gt;K2&lt;/a&gt; (the second-highest mountain on earth. Other well-known peaks include &lt;a href=\"Masherbrum\"&gt;Masherbrum&lt;/a&gt; (also known as K1), &lt;a href=\"Broad%20Peak\"&gt;Broad Peak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Peak\"&gt;Hidden Peak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gasherbrum%20II\"&gt;Gasherbrum II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gasherbrum%20IV\"&gt;Gasherbrum IV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chogolisa\"&gt;Chogolisa&lt;/a&gt; (in the &lt;a href=\"Khaplu%20Valley\"&gt;Khaplu Valley&lt;/a&gt;). The following peaks have been scaled:\nDemographics.\nThe region has a population of about 322,000. It is a blend of ethnic groups, predominantly &lt;a href=\"Balti%20people\"&gt;Baltis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20people\"&gt;Tibetans&lt;/a&gt;. A few &lt;a href=\"Kashmiris\"&gt;Kashmiris&lt;/a&gt; settled in Skardu, practicing agriculture and woodcraft.\nReligion.\nBefore the arrival of Islam, Tibetan Buddhism and B\u00f6n (to a lesser extent) were the main religions in Baltistan. Buddhism can be traced back to before the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Tibetan%20Empire\"&gt;Tibetan Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the region during the seventh century. The region has a number of surviving &lt;a href=\"Buddhist%20art\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; archaeological sites. These include the &lt;a href=\"Manthal%20Buddha%20Rock\"&gt;Manthal Buddha Rock&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"rock%20relief\"&gt;rock relief&lt;/a&gt; of the Buddha at the edge of the village (near &lt;a href=\"Skardu\"&gt;Skardu&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Rock%20of%20Hunza\"&gt;Sacred Rock of Hunza&lt;/a&gt;. Nearby are former sites of Buddhist shelters.\nIslam was brought to Baltistan by &lt;a href=\"Sufism\"&gt;Sufi&lt;/a&gt; missionaries during the 16th and 17th centuries, and most of the population converted to &lt;a href=\"Noorbakshia%20Islam\"&gt;Noorbakshia Islam&lt;/a&gt;. The scholars were followers of the &lt;a href=\"Kubrawiya\"&gt;Kubrawiya&lt;/a&gt; Sufi order. Most Noorbakhshi Muslims live in Ghanche and Shigar districts, and 30 percent live in the Skardu district.\nFauna.\nBaltistan has been called a living museum for wildlife. &lt;a href=\"Deosai%20National%20Park\"&gt;Deosai National Park&lt;/a&gt;, in the southern part of the region, is habitat for predators since it has an abundant prey population. Domestic animals include &lt;a href=\"yak\"&gt;yak&lt;/a&gt;s (including &lt;a href=\"Yak%23Hybrid%20yak\"&gt;hybrid yaks&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s. Wild animals include &lt;a href=\"ibex\"&gt;ibex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"markhor\"&gt;markhor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"musk%20deer\"&gt;musk deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snow%20leopard\"&gt;snow leopard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"brown%20bear\"&gt;brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asian%20black%20bear\"&gt;black bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jackal\"&gt;jackal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Gray%20wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"marmot\"&gt;marmot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCulture.\nBalti music and art.\nAccording to Balti folklore, &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20emperors\"&gt;Mughal&lt;/a&gt; princess Gul Khatoon (known in Baltistan as Mindoq Gialmo\u2014Flower Queen) brought musicians and artisans with her into the region and they propagated Mughal music and art under her patronage. Musical instruments such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Zurna\"&gt;surnai&lt;/a&gt;\", \"karnai\", \"dhol\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Fangxiang\"&gt;chang&lt;/a&gt;\" were introduced into Baltistan.\nDance.\nClassical and other dances are classified as sword dances, \"broqchhos\" and &lt;a href=\"Yakkha%20people\"&gt;Yakkha&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"ghazal\"&gt;ghazal&lt;/a&gt;\" dances. \"Chhogho Prasul\" commemorates a victory by the &lt;a href=\"Maqpon%20dynasty\"&gt;Maqpon \"rajas\"&lt;/a&gt;. As a mark of respect, the musician who plays the drum (\"dang\") plays for a long time. A Maqpon princess would occasionally dance to this tune. \"Gasho-Pa\", also known as \"Ghbus-La-Khorba\", is a sword dance associated with the Gasho Dynasty of Purik (&lt;a href=\"Kargil\"&gt;Kargil&lt;/a&gt;). \"Sneopa\", the marriage-procession dance by \"pachones\" (twelve \"wazirs\" who accompany the bride), is performed at the marriage of a \"raja\".\nArchitecture.\nBalti architecture has Tibetan and Mughul influences, and its monastic architecture reflects the Buddhist imprint left on the region. Buddhist-style &lt;a href=\"wall%20painting\"&gt;wall painting&lt;/a&gt;s can be seen in forts and Noorbakhshi \"&lt;a href=\"khanqah\"&gt;khanqah&lt;/a&gt;s\", including &lt;a href=\"Chaqchan%20Mosque\"&gt;Chaqchan Mosque&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Khaplu\"&gt;Khaplu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amburik%20Mosque\"&gt;Amburik Mosque&lt;/a&gt; in Shigar, Khanqah e Muallah Shigar, &lt;a href=\"Khaplu%20Fort\"&gt;Khaplu Fort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shigar%20Fort\"&gt;Shigar Fort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skardu%20Fort\"&gt;Skardu Fort&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolo.\n&lt;a href=\"Polo\"&gt;Polo&lt;/a&gt; is popular in Baltistan, and indigenous to the Karakoram region, having been played there since at least the 15th\u201316th century. The Maqpon ruler &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Sher%20Khan%20Anchan\"&gt;Ali Sher Khan Anchan&lt;/a&gt; introduced the game to other valleys during his conquests beyond Gilgit and Chitral. The English word &lt;a href=\"polo%23Origins\"&gt;polo&lt;/a&gt; derives from the &lt;a href=\"Balti%20language\"&gt;Balti&lt;/a&gt; word \"polo\", meaning \"the ball used in the game of polo\". The game of polo itself is called \"shagran\" in Balti.\nMedia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pakistan%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; has radio and television stations in &lt;a href=\"Khaplu\"&gt;Khaplu&lt;/a&gt; that broadcast local programs, and there are a handful of private news outlets. The \"Daily K2\" is an &lt;a href=\"Urdu\"&gt;Urdu&lt;/a&gt; newspaper published in &lt;a href=\"Skardu\"&gt;Skardu&lt;/a&gt; serving &lt;a href=\"Gilgit-Baltistan\"&gt;Gilgit-Baltistan&lt;/a&gt; for long time, and it is the pioneer of print media in Gilgit Baltisatn. \"Bad-e-Shimal\" claims the largest daily circulation in &lt;a href=\"Gilgit\"&gt;Gilgit&lt;/a&gt; and Baltistan. \"Nawa-e-Sufia\" is a monthly magazine covering Baltistan's Nurbakshi sect."
