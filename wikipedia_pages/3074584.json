    "text": "\u201cPossession\u201d is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20McLachlan\"&gt;Sarah McLachlan&lt;/a&gt;, and was the first &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; from her album \"&lt;a href=\"Fumbling%20Towards%20Ecstasy\"&gt;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&lt;/a&gt;.\" It was written and composed by McLachlan herself and was produced by &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Marchand\"&gt;Pierre Marchand&lt;/a&gt;. It was released in Canada on 10 September 1993 by &lt;a href=\"Nettwerk%20Records\"&gt;Nettwerk Records&lt;/a&gt;. The song appears twice on the album, as the first track and as a &lt;a href=\"hidden%20track\"&gt;hidden track&lt;/a&gt; at the end, which is a solo piano version. \u201cPossession\u201d is written from the viewpoint of a man obsessed with a woman, and was inspired by consistent fan letters to McLachlan some time before the writing of the song from a computer programmer from Ottawa, Ontario named Uwe Vandrei, who sued McLachlan for using his words without crediting him. However, Vandrei committed suicide before the case could ever be taken to court.\nThe main recording of \"Possession\" also appeared on the 2008 compilation album \",\" and McLachlan has also released live, alternate and remixed versions of the song.\nInspiration.\nThe song was inspired by McLachlan's reaction to two deranged fans, both of whom had concocted a fantasy in which they were already in a relationship with her. Of the two, the more famous is Uwe Vandrei, an &lt;a href=\"Ottawa\"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; native who sued McLachlan in 1994, alleging that his love letters to her had been the basis of \"Possession\". Vandrei had written and sent McLachlan love poems, although there is no direct connection between those poems and the lyrics of \"Possession.\" Vandrei's lawsuit never came to trial as he died by suicide in the autumn of 1994.\nIn an interview with \"&lt;a href=\"Rolling%20Stone\"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;\" three years later, McLachlan said, \"And this one person wasn't the only guy ... there were a lot of letters from other people saying the same kind of thing ... Writing the song 'Possession' was very therapeutic.\" She also stated that, since the release of \"Possession,\" she had stopped getting stalker-type fan letters, for which she was grateful.\nMusic videos.\nCanadian version.\nThe original version of the video features a remixed background track and depicts Sarah McLachlan wrapped in white cloth, as &lt;a href=\"Eve\"&gt;Eve&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potiphar\"&gt;Potiphar's wife&lt;/a&gt;, and other such &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; references, depicting vanity, deceit, corruption, intimacy and other &lt;a href=\"taboo\"&gt;taboo&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative society&lt;/a&gt;. As McLachlan explained: \"Oh it's so lofty, it's pompous now. I was trying to dispel that by showing a bunch of female archetypes using historical paintings, \u2018&lt;a href=\"The%20Birth%20of%20Venus%20%28Botticelli%29\"&gt;Venus&lt;/a&gt;,\u2019 \u2018&lt;a href=\"Adam%20and%20Eve\"&gt;Adam and Eve&lt;/a&gt;,\u2019 \u2018&lt;a href=\"Salome%27s%20Last%20Dance\"&gt;Salome's Last Dance&lt;/a&gt;.\u2019 I wanted to show all women possessing all these different archetypes. I also had myself suspended in the air and wrapped in gauze, as if my personality and my sexuality were bound. Throughout the video I was being unraveled by unseen forces, and I came out in the end strong and free and \u2013 Ta Da! \u2013 there I was my own self. Yes, it was pretty lofty [...] and the label told me...\" This video was directed by McLachlan herself, and features her friends and band members.\nUnited States version.\nThe video for the US market released in 1994 features the original album version of the song being played by McLachlan and her band in a &lt;a href=\"Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral-style&lt;/a&gt; hall. It was directed by Julie Hermelin.\nOther versions.\nIn addition to the two different versions of \"Possession\" appearing on the \"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\" album, a live recording of the song is available on McLachlan's 1999 live concert album \"&lt;a href=\"Mirrorball%20%28Sarah%20McLachlan%20album%29\"&gt;Mirrorball&lt;/a&gt;.\" A fourth version, the &lt;a href=\"Rabbit%20in%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Rabbit in the Moon&lt;/a&gt; remix, is available on two different McLachlan remix albums: \"&lt;a href=\"Rarities%2C%20B-Sides%20and%20Other%20Stuff\"&gt;Rarities, B-Sides and Other Stuff&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Remixed%20%28Sarah%20McLachlan%20album%29\"&gt;Remixed&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nMcLachlan recorded another version of the song for the 2005 &lt;a href=\"iTunes\"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;-only digital album \"&lt;a href=\"iTunes%20Originals%20%E2%80%93%20Sarah%20McLachlan\"&gt;iTunes Originals \u2013 Sarah McLachlan&lt;/a&gt;.\""
