    "text": "\"The Tears of a Clown\" is a song written by &lt;a href=\"Hank%20Cosby\"&gt;Hank Cosby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smokey%20Robinson\"&gt;Smokey Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stevie%20Wonder\"&gt;Stevie Wonder&lt;/a&gt; and originally recorded by &lt;a href=\"The%20Miracles\"&gt;Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles&lt;/a&gt; for the Tamla Records label subsidiary of &lt;a href=\"Motown\"&gt;Motown&lt;/a&gt;, first appearing on the 1967 album \"&lt;a href=\"Make%20It%20Happen%20%28Smokey%20Robinson%20and%20the%20Miracles%20album%29\"&gt;Make It Happen&lt;/a&gt;\". It was re-released in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; as a single in July 1970, and it became a #1 hit on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; for the week ending 12 September 1970. Subsequently, Motown released \"The Tears of a Clown\" as a single in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; as well, where it quickly became a #1 hit on both the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs\"&gt;R&amp;B Singles&lt;/a&gt; charts.\nThis song is an international multi-million seller and a 2002 &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Grammy Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; inductee. Its success led Miracles lead singer, songwriter, and producer Smokey Robinson, who had announced plans to leave the act, to stay until 1972.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\n&lt;a href=\"Stevie%20Wonder\"&gt;Stevie Wonder&lt;/a&gt; (who was discovered by Miracles member &lt;a href=\"Ronnie%20White\"&gt;Ronnie White&lt;/a&gt;) and his producer &lt;a href=\"Hank%20Cosby\"&gt;Hank Cosby&lt;/a&gt; wrote the music for the song, and Cosby produced the instrumental track recording. Wonder brought the instrumental track to the 1966 Motown Christmas party because he could not come up with a lyric to fit the instrumental. Wonder wanted to see what Robinson could come up with for the track. Robinson, who remarked that the song's distinctive &lt;a href=\"calliope%20%28music%29\"&gt;calliope&lt;/a&gt; motif \"sounded like a circus,\" provided lyrics that reflected his vision and sang lead vocal. In the song, his character, sad because a woman has left him, compares himself to the characters in the &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Pagliacci\"&gt;Pagliacci&lt;/a&gt;\", comedians/clowns who hide their hurt and anger behind empty smiles. He had used this comparison before: the line \"just like Pagliacci did/I'll try to keep my sadness hid\" appears in this song as well as in \"My Smile Is Just A Frown (Turned Upside Down)\", which he had written in 1964 for Motown artist &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20Crawford\"&gt;Carolyn Crawford&lt;/a&gt;. The record is one of the few hit pop singles to feature the &lt;a href=\"bassoon\"&gt;bassoon&lt;/a&gt;, which was played by Charles R. Sirard.\n\"The Tears of a Clown\" was an album track on 1967's \"&lt;a href=\"Make%20It%20Happen%20%28Miracles%20album%29\"&gt;Make It Happen&lt;/a&gt;\" but was not released as a single. \"The Tears of a Clown\" on the monaural version of \"Make It Happen\" contains an alternate lead vocal with a slightly different verse melody. By 1969, Robinson had become tired of constantly touring with the Miracles, and wanted to remain home in &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, with his wife &lt;a href=\"Claudette%20Rogers%20Robinson\"&gt;Claudette&lt;/a&gt; and their two children, Berry and Tamla (both named after aspects of the Motown corporation). Robinson informed his groupmates &lt;a href=\"Warren%20%26quot%3BPete%26quot%3B%20Moore\"&gt;Pete Moore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Rogers\"&gt;Bobby Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, and best friend &lt;a href=\"Ronnie%20White\"&gt;Ronald White&lt;/a&gt; that he would be retiring from the act to concentrate on his duties as &lt;a href=\"vice-president\"&gt;vice-president&lt;/a&gt; of Motown Records.\nCommercial success.\nIn 1970, to capitalize on the Miracles' success there, and due to a lack of new material from the group, Motown Britain selected \"The Tears of a Clown\" from the group's catalog for single release. One account suggests it was Karen Spreadbury, head of the British division of the Motown Fan Club, who first recommended the track to &lt;a href=\"John%20Reid%20%28music%20manager%29\"&gt;John Reid&lt;/a&gt;, then UK manager for the American Tamla Motown label, who went on to manage &lt;a href=\"Elton%20John\"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20%28band%29\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;, when he asked her which track she'd favor as a single from the 1967 album. Reid reportedly then gave the go ahead for \u201cTears of A Clown\u201d to be issued as the single. The record became a #1 hit in the UK seven weeks after its July release. \nThis newfound popularity prompted Motown to release the song as a single in the United States, using a new mix of the song made in February 1970 (whereas the UK release had used the original 1967 stereo mix from the \"Make It Happen\" LP). \"&lt;a href=\"Cash%20Box\"&gt;Cash Box&lt;/a&gt;\" said of the US single release that it was a \"brilliant return to the heyday sound of the Miracles,\" calling it \"bright blues rock that hasn't been heard here for a long while.\" It became a #1 hit on both the pop and &lt;a href=\"rhythm%20and%20blues\"&gt;R&amp;B&lt;/a&gt; charts within two months of its release. Despite the fact that the Miracles had been one of Motown's premier acts in the early and mid-1960s and its first successful group act, \"The Tears of a Clown\" was their first and only #1 hit while Smokey Robinson was lead singer. (The Miracles hit #1 again several years later with the smash hit \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20Machine%20%28The%20Miracles%20song%29\"&gt;Love Machine&lt;/a&gt;\", but by that time Smokey had long since left the group, replaced by &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Griffin\"&gt;Billy Griffin&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Shop%20Around\"&gt;Shop Around&lt;/a&gt;\" had hit #1 on the &lt;a href=\"Cash%20Box\"&gt;Cash Box&lt;/a&gt; Pop Chart, but only #2 on &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20charts\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;'s.)\nThe 45 single was issued with two different &lt;a href=\"B-side\"&gt;B-side&lt;/a&gt;s: the first pressing had an alternate version of the 1967 Miracles Top 20 hit single \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Love%20I%20Saw%20in%20You%20Was%20Just%20a%20Mirage\"&gt;The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage&lt;/a&gt;;\" the second had a new Miracles song, \"Promise Me\". Motown released a \"Tears of a Clown\" LP in 1970 as well, which was essentially a re-packaging of the Miracles' 1967 \"Make It Happen\". It was included again on the group's 1971 LP \"&lt;a href=\"One%20Dozen%20Roses\"&gt;One Dozen Roses&lt;/a&gt;\", which used a new stereo mix.\nTwo years later, Smokey Robinson decided to follow through with his plans to leave the Miracles and retire. Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles embarked on a six-month farewell tour, culminating in a July 16, 1972 performance in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20DC\"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;, where Robinson introduced the Miracles' new lead singer, Billy Griffin.\nThe song charted again in the UK in 1976, peaking at #34 (see &lt;a href=\"The%20Miracles%20discography\"&gt;The Miracles discography&lt;/a&gt;). \"The Tears of a Clown\" continues to be a popular radio request.\nThe Beat version.\nIn 1979, British &lt;a href=\"ska\"&gt;ska&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"New%20wave%20music\"&gt;new wave&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"The%20Beat%20%28British%20band%29\"&gt;The Beat&lt;/a&gt; released a cover of the song as their debut single. The double A-side with \"Ranking Full Stop\" reached number 6 on the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;, making it the band's third biggest hit. It was also certified silver in the UK by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Phonographic%20Industry\"&gt;BPI&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt wasn't included on the original UK release of The Beat's debut album, \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Just%20Can%27t%20Stop%20It\"&gt;I Just Can't Stop It&lt;/a&gt;\", but was included on the US release and has been included on subsequent CD reissues of the album."
