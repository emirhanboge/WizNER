    "text": "The District Museum Building in Bydgoszcz is an historical building in &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt; located at 4 &lt;a href=\"Gda%C5%84ska%20Street%20in%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Gda\u0144ska Street&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nThe building stands near &lt;a href=\"Poor%20Clares%27%20Church%2C%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Poor Clares' Church&lt;/a&gt;, in Bydgoszcz's downtown (\"\u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie\") district.\nHistory.\nHistorically, the building is associated with the 15th-century hospital and shelter Church of Holy Spirit. Originally it was only two wooden workhouses, located outside of the old city of &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt;, thus hindering potential transmissions of epidemic diseases.\nA plaque mentioning the date of 1593 is still present at the ground floor of the actual building: it confirms that a brick-made hospital was still standing here at the end of the 16th century. In 1618, a new edifice has been erected: the convent of the Poor Clares in Bydgoszcz. This monastery built in 3 years (1615-1618), was close to the Poor Clares' ancient Church of the Holy Ghost.\nIn the 17th century, with the expansion of the monastery, &lt;a href=\"cloister\"&gt;cloister&lt;/a&gt;s were constructed, connecting the monastery to the &lt;a href=\"Poor%20Clares%27%20Church%2C%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;church of the Poor Clares&lt;/a&gt;. These cloisters were demolished at the end of the 18th century, when &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt; passed under the authority of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Kingdom of Prussia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1830-1840, the monastery building was partly restored. According to a local account carried out in 1760, the monastery of the Poor Clares was reported to have a huge amount of goods: a distillery (from 1751), stables, coach houses, a brewery, a fish pond and gardens. \nIn January 1834, the Prussian authorities announced the &lt;a href=\"secularization\"&gt;secularization&lt;/a&gt; of the convent of Poor Clares, and in 1837 the monastery and the church became the property of the city of &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe monastery buildings were initially planned to become a school, but eventually a municipal clinic was established. Re-customized halls could accommodate 28 beds, and in the mid-19th century, building interiors were refurbished to fit the new needs of the hospital. \nBetween 1861 and 1863, the dismantling of the cloister (and the gate attached) definitely separated the &lt;a href=\"Poor%20Clares%27%20Church%2C%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; from the former monastery building.\nIn 1878, Wilhelm Lincke, city building counselor, approved the addition of a wing along Gdanska street, with &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Renaissance Revival architecture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mannerism\"&gt;Mannerism&lt;/a&gt; style, like the adjoined street building facades. In 1937, the Municipal Hospital was accommodating 70 beds and was admitting 600 patients per year and at this date, it was transferred to another part of town. During the period 1938-1945, the building housed the Department of Social Welfare of the City.\nThe facility has been housing since 11 April 1946, the &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Museum%20%26quot%3BLeon%20Wycz%C3%B3%C5%82kowski%26quot%3B\"&gt;District Museum of the city&lt;/a&gt;, then the administrative seat of Bydgoszcz museums, named after &lt;a href=\"Leon%20Wycz%C3%B3%C5%82kowski\"&gt;Leon Wycz\u00f3\u0142kowski&lt;/a&gt;. It displays a rich collection of works by the artist, and a valuable collection of contemporary art works throughout several sites in the &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;. The edifice has been refurbished and enlarged in 2020.\nArchitecture.\nThe building is a 3 stairs and two-winged structure. The main edifice has a &lt;a href=\"Mansard%20roof\"&gt;Mansard roof&lt;/a&gt;. The front elevation displays &lt;a href=\"bossage\"&gt;bossage&lt;/a&gt;s, and the portal is adorned with columns. Each wing and its slight &lt;a href=\"avant-corps\"&gt;avant-corps&lt;/a&gt; is topped with a &lt;a href=\"gable\"&gt;gable&lt;/a&gt; and decorated &lt;a href=\"pilaster\"&gt;pilaster&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe building has been registered on the Pomeranian Heritage List (N\u00b0601230-reg.A/278), 22 April 1953 and 12 May 1993."
