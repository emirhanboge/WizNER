The bid was initially in threat of falling apart after a budget dispute between &lt;a href=\"Aichi%20Prefecture\"&gt;Aichi Prefecture&lt;/a&gt; and its capital Nagoya, but was resolved, allowing the bid to be accepted. The OCA originally planned to choose the 2026 host city in 2018, but brought the planning date forward due to the intensity of the region's sporting calendar, including the next three &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Winter Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; between 2018, 2022 and 2026.\nDevelopment and preparations.\nCosts.\nThe city of Nagoya received an estimate of roughly \u00a585 billion in costs from the Aichi Prefecture government for the event, 30% of which is expected to be covered by sponsorships and other revenue, while the remainder is planned to be split on a 70\u201330 basis between Nagoya and Aichi Prefecture.\nVenues.\nThe Games are planned to use existing facilities. &lt;a href=\"Paloma%20Mizuho%20Stadium\"&gt;Paloma Mizuho Stadium&lt;/a&gt; will host both the opening and closing ceremonies and &lt;a href=\"Sport%20of%20athletics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nippon%20Gaishi%20Hall\"&gt;Nippon Gaishi Hall&lt;/a&gt; Complex is to be used for both &lt;a href=\"gymnastics\"&gt;gymnastics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20water%20sports\"&gt;aquatics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nagoya%20Dome\"&gt;Nagoya Dome&lt;/a&gt; is to be used for &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Toyota%20Stadium%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;Toyota Stadium&lt;/a&gt; is to be used for &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;."
