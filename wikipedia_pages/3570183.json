    "text": "Alton Henry Maddox Jr. (born July 21, 1945) is an American &lt;a href=\"lawyer\"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; who was involved in several high-profile civil rights cases in the 1980s.\nEducation.\nMaddox was born in &lt;a href=\"Inkster%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Inkster, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; and grew up in &lt;a href=\"Newnan%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Newnan, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. He began practicing law in 1976, after graduating from &lt;a href=\"Howard%20University\"&gt;Howard University&lt;/a&gt; (BA, 1967) and &lt;a href=\"Boston%20College%20Law%20School\"&gt;Boston College Law School&lt;/a&gt; (JD, 1971).\nClients.\nMaddox represented several alleged victims including the family of Michael Stewart, a &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; man who died while in custody of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Transit%20Police\"&gt;New York City Transit Police&lt;/a&gt;. Six officers were indicted for the death; all were found not guilty. &lt;a href=\"Rudy%20Giuliani\"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"US%20Attorney\"&gt;US Attorney&lt;/a&gt; in Manhattan, found insufficient evidence to warrant a federal grand jury investigation. A &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority\"&gt;Metropolitan Transportation Authority&lt;/a&gt; report later faulted police for use of excessive force.\nHe was the attorney for Cedric Sandiford and the family of &lt;a href=\"manslaughter\"&gt;manslaughter&lt;/a&gt; victim &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Griffith%20%28manslaughter%20victim%29\"&gt;Michael Griffith&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Beach%23Howard%20Beach%20incident\"&gt;Howard Beach incident&lt;/a&gt;. Maddox and other lawyers demanded a special prosecutor be appointed to the case, and the request was eventually granted. Maddox accused the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%20Police%20Department\"&gt;New York City Police Department&lt;/a&gt; and Commissioner &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Ward\"&gt;Benjamin Ward&lt;/a&gt; of a cover-up.\nHe represented &lt;a href=\"Tawana%20Brawley\"&gt;Tawana Brawley&lt;/a&gt; during the period of her rape allegations. Maddox and &lt;a href=\"Al%20Sharpton\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C.%20Vernon%20Mason\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; Brawley advisers accused Assistant District Attorney &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Pagones\"&gt;Steven Pagones&lt;/a&gt; of abducting and raping Brawley. A grand jury did not charge Pagones.\nThe family of murder victim &lt;a href=\"Yusuf%20Hawkins\"&gt;Yusuf Hawkins&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bensonhurst\"&gt;Bensonhurst&lt;/a&gt; incident was also one of Maddox's clients. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.nytimes.com/1989/08/27/nyregion/marchers-and-brooklyn-youths-trade-racial-jeers.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nMaddox has represented many defendants, including Michael Briscoe, arrested during the investigation into the alleged rape of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Park%20jogger\"&gt;Central Park jogger&lt;/a&gt;. Briscoe was found innocent in that case. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/central-park-jogger-case-changed-innocent-victims-city-article-1.363139%3FoutputType%3Damp\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nIn 1984, Maddox was arrested and charged with &lt;a href=\"obstruction%20of%20justice\"&gt;obstruction of justice&lt;/a&gt; after a courtroom melee in which he and his client &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Bosket\"&gt;Willie Bosket&lt;/a&gt; were confronted by court officers.\nMaddox was the defense lawyer for one of the two men hired by &lt;a href=\"Marla%20Hanson\"&gt;Marla Hanson&lt;/a&gt;'s landlord to mutilate and disfigure her. Maddox challenged Hanson's character during the trial. This led &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Assembly\"&gt;New York State Assembly&lt;/a&gt;man &lt;a href=\"Dov%20Hikind\"&gt;Dov Hikind&lt;/a&gt; to ask a grievance committee \"to investigate the professional behavior of Mr. Maddox.\" Maddox responded, It's my job to question the character of Mr. Bowman. Law professor &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Gillers\"&gt;Stephen Gillers&lt;/a&gt; of New York University Law School said, \"There's nothing unethical about what he is reported to have done.\"\nMaddox also represented &lt;a href=\"Al%20Sharpton\"&gt;Al Sharpton&lt;/a&gt; when Sharpton faced a 67-count indictment alleging fraud and theft. Sharpton was acquitted of all charges.\nDisciplinary actions.\nIn 1990, Maddox was indefinitely suspended by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn after failing to appear before a disciplinary hearing to answer allegations regarding his conduct in the Brawley case.\nIn 1996, Maddox was ordered to pay New York State $1,000 in legal costs for filing a false complaint of racial bias. He had alleged that he had had to apply to represent an indigent defendant in a murder case, while two lawyers who were white had been appointed to represent the other defendant in the case without having to apply. The state showed evidence that in fact, the two lawyers had applied and Maddox had filed a discrimination suit instead of going through the applications process. &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Mukasey\"&gt;Michael Mukasey&lt;/a&gt;, at that time a Federal judge, ordered Maddox to pay New York State the legal costs it had incurred defending against the suit.\nThe following year, in 1997, Maddox and his group, the United African Movement, were fined $10,000 by New York City's Commission on Human Rights after they denied a white teacher access to a speech by &lt;a href=\"Cornel%20West\"&gt;Cornel West&lt;/a&gt; on the basis of her race.\nOther activities.\nMaddox is a former Director of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Conference%20of%20Black%20Lawyers\"&gt;National Conference of Black Lawyers&lt;/a&gt; Juvenile Defense Project. He is also the founder of the Center for Law &amp; Social Justice at &lt;a href=\"Medgar%20Evers%20College\"&gt;Medgar Evers College&lt;/a&gt; and co-sponsored the 1983 Congressional hearings on Police Brutality in New York City. A 2006 resolution passed by the Council of the City of New York supported Maddox's reinstatement, but the New York State Attorney General's office has not acted on this request.\nMaddox often contributes to publications such as \"&lt;a href=\"Amsterdam%20News\"&gt;Amsterdam News&lt;/a&gt;\" and is a frequent guest on &lt;a href=\"WLIB\"&gt;WLIB&lt;/a&gt; radio's \"Sharp Talk\" program, hosted by Sharpton. He has also given speeches at several colleges and rallies. His 1995 speech prior to the &lt;a href=\"Million%20Man%20March\"&gt;Million Man March&lt;/a&gt; was criticized by commentators and the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Defamation%20League\"&gt;Anti-Defamation League&lt;/a&gt; for its support of a &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Farrakhan\"&gt;Louis Farrakhan&lt;/a&gt; quote characterizing Jews as \"bloodsuckers\".\nPersonal life.\nHe was married to Leola W. Maddox, who died in 2017. They had a son."
