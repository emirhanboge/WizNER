    "text": "Athletic Club (; ), commonly known as Athletic Bilbao or just Athletic, is a professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in the city of &lt;a href=\"Bilbao\"&gt;Bilbao&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29\"&gt;Basque Country&lt;/a&gt; in Spain. They are known as \"Los Leones\" (The Lions) because their stadium was built near a church called \"San Mam\u00e9s\" (Saint Mammes). &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Mammes%20of%20Caesarea\"&gt;Mammes&lt;/a&gt; was an early Christian thrown to the lions by the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Romans&lt;/a&gt;. Mammes pacified the lions and was later made a &lt;a href=\"saint\"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt;. The team plays its home matches at the &lt;a href=\"San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium\"&gt;San Mam\u00e9s Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Its home colours are red and white-striped shirts with black shorts.\nAthletic are the fourth most successful club in \"La Liga\" with eight titles to their name. In the table of \"&lt;a href=\"Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;Copa del Rey&lt;/a&gt;\" titles, Athletic is second only to Barcelona, having won it 23 times. It is also the most successful Basque football club in both league and cup titles won. The club also has one of the most successful &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Club%20Femenino\"&gt;women's teams&lt;/a&gt; in Spain, which has won five championships in the \"&lt;a href=\"Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20%28women%29\"&gt;Primera Divisi\u00f3n Femenina&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe club is one of three founding members of the \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Liga\"&gt;Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;\" that have &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20unrelegated%20association%20football%20clubs\"&gt;never been relegated&lt;/a&gt; from the top division since its inception in 1929, the others being &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20CF\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. These three clubs, along with &lt;a href=\"CA%20Osasuna\"&gt;Osasuna&lt;/a&gt;, are the only four professional clubs in Spain that are not sports corporations; instead they are owned and operated by club members. Athletic's main rivals are &lt;a href=\"Real%20Sociedad\"&gt;Real Sociedad&lt;/a&gt;, against whom it contests the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20derby\"&gt;Basque derby&lt;/a&gt;, and Real Madrid, due to &lt;a href=\"El%20Viejo%20Cl%C3%A1sico\"&gt;sporting and political identity&lt;/a&gt;; a minor rivalry also exists with Barcelona due to &lt;a href=\"Athletic%E2%80%93Barcelona%20cl%C3%A1sico\"&gt;historical significance&lt;/a&gt;. At various points in the club's history, further &lt;a href=\"Basque%20football%20derbies\"&gt;Basque league derbies&lt;/a&gt; have been contested against &lt;a href=\"Deportivo%20Alav%C3%A9s\"&gt;Alav\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"SD%20Eibar\"&gt;Eibar&lt;/a&gt; and Osasuna.\nThe club is known for its \"&lt;a href=\"cantera\"&gt;cantera&lt;/a&gt;\" policy of bringing young &lt;a href=\"Basques\"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; players through &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Bilbao%20cantera\"&gt;the ranks&lt;/a&gt;, as well as recruiting players from other Basque clubs. Athletic's &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Bilbao%20signing%20policy\"&gt;official policy&lt;/a&gt; is to sign players native to or trained in football in the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29\"&gt;greater Basque Country&lt;/a&gt;, which includes &lt;a href=\"Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gipuzkoa\"&gt;Gipuzkoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lava\"&gt;\u00c1lava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Navarre\"&gt;Navarre&lt;/a&gt; (in Spain); and &lt;a href=\"Labourd\"&gt;Labourd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soule\"&gt;Soule&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Navarre\"&gt;Lower Navarre&lt;/a&gt; (in France). Since 1912, Athletic has played exclusively with players meeting its own criteria to be deemed Basque. This can be seen as a unique case in European football; it has gained Athletic both admirers and critics. The club has been praised for promoting home grown players and club loyalty. The rule does not apply to coaching staff, with several examples of non-Basques both from Spain and abroad having coached the first team.\nDespite the implications of the name 'Athletic Club' in English, and unlike some of the other major Spanish teams which have several departments, it is not a &lt;a href=\"multi-sport%20club\"&gt;multi-sport club&lt;/a&gt;, participating only in football, although sections for &lt;a href=\"cycle%20sport\"&gt;cycling&lt;/a&gt; and others existed prior to the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in the 1930s.\nHistory.\nBilbao FC, Athletic Club and Club Bizcaya.\nFootball was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Bilbao\"&gt;Bilbao&lt;/a&gt; by two distinct groups with British connections: British workers and Basque students returning from schools in Britain. In the late 19th century, Bilbao was a leading industrial town and attracted many migrant workers, including miners from the north-east of England and shipyard workers from &lt;a href=\"Southampton\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;. They brought with them the game of football and came together to form . Meanwhile, sons of the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20people\"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; educated classes, like Juan de Astorquia, went to Britain to complete their studies, developed an interest in football and on their return began to arrange games with British workers. In 1898, Juan de Astorquia, Luis Astorquia and other students founded the \"Athletic Club\", using the English spelling.\nIn 1901, a meeting held in the Caf\u00e9 Garc\u00eda established more formal rules and regulations. In 1902, the two clubs formed a combined team known as Club Bizcaya and elected as president founding member Juan de Astorquia in the first &lt;a href=\"Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;Copa del Rey&lt;/a&gt; and won the competition. This led to the eventual merger of the two clubs as \"Athletic Club\" in 1903. In the same year, under the presidency of Juan de Astorquia, Basque students also formed \"Athletic Club Madrid,\" which later evolved into &lt;a href=\"Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid\"&gt;Atl\u00e9tico Madrid&lt;/a&gt;. The club itself declares 1898 as its foundation date.\nCopa del Rey.\nThe club featured prominently in early Copas del Rey. Following the inaugural win by \"Club Bizcaya\", the newly formed Athletic Bilbao won it again in 1903, both times under Juan de Astorquia who was President and Captain. In 1904, they were declared winners after their opponents failed to turn up. In 1907, they revived the name \"Club Vizcaya\" after entering a combined team with \"Union Vizcaino\". After a brief lull, they won again in &lt;a href=\"1910%20Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;1910&lt;/a&gt;, with Luis de Astorquia as the new captain and goalkeeper and then three times in a row between 1914 and 1916. The star was &lt;a href=\"Pichichi%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Pichichi&lt;/a&gt;, who scored the first goal at the &lt;a href=\"San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium%20%281913%29\"&gt;San Mam\u00e9s stadium&lt;/a&gt; in 1913 and a hat-trick in the &lt;a href=\"1915%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final\"&gt;1915 cup final&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Pichichi%20Trophy\"&gt;La Liga top scorer award&lt;/a&gt; is named in his honour.\nThe first La Liga.\nOther Basque clubs such as &lt;a href=\"Real%20Uni%C3%B3n\"&gt;Real Uni\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arenas%20Club%20de%20Getxo\"&gt;Arenas Club de Getxo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Real%20Sociedad\"&gt;Real Sociedad&lt;/a&gt; were also founding members of La Liga in 1928 and by 1930 they were joined by &lt;a href=\"Deportivo%20Alav%C3%A9s\"&gt;CD Alav\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;; five of the ten clubs in the \"Primera Divisi\u00f3n\" were from the Basque Country. The saying \"Con cantera y afici\u00f3n, no hace falta importaci\u00f3n\", translated as \"With home-grown teams and support, there is no need for import\", made sense during these early days.\nThe Fred Pentland Era.\nIn 1921, a new English coach, &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Pentland\"&gt;Fred Pentland&lt;/a&gt;, arrived; in 1923, he led the club to victory in the Copa del Rey. He revolutionised the way Athletic played, favouring the short-passing game. In 1927, Pentland left Athletic but returned in 1929 and led the club to La Liga/Copa del Rey doubles in 1930 and 1931. The club won the Copa del Rey four times in a row between 1930 and 1933 and they were also La Liga runners-up in 1932 and 1933. In 1931, Athletic defeated Barcelona 12\u20131, the latter's worst-ever defeat.\nThe league title under Garbutt.\nAthletic's success under English coaches continued with &lt;a href=\"William%20Garbutt\"&gt;William Garbutt&lt;/a&gt;. His first season in Spain was a massive success as he managed to win the &lt;a href=\"1935%E2%80%9336%20La%20Liga\"&gt;Liga&lt;/a&gt; that year. He had inherited a talented squad which included strikers &lt;a href=\"Guillermo%20Gorostiza\"&gt;Guillermo Gorostiza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agust%C3%ADn%20Sauto%20Arana\"&gt;Bata&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarbutt promoted the young &lt;a href=\"%C3%81ngel%20Zubieta\"&gt;\u00c1ngel Zubieta&lt;/a&gt; to the first team, a player who at 17 years of age went on to become the youngest ever to play for the Spanish national team at the time. In the final game of the season, the title was decided when Athletic defeated Oviedo 2\u20130 at home on 19 April 1936, winning the title just two points clear of Real Madrid. In July 1936, football halted due to the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. The league did not restart until the &lt;a href=\"1939%E2%80%9340%20La%20Liga\"&gt;1939\u201340 season&lt;/a&gt;. Athletic Club did not win the title again until &lt;a href=\"1942%E2%80%9343%20La%20Liga\"&gt;1943&lt;/a&gt; and by that time Garbutt had been exiled.\nAtl\u00e9tico Bilbao.\nIn 1941, the club changed its name to \"Atl\u00e9tico Bilbao\", following &lt;a href=\"Language%20politics%20in%20Francoist%20Spain\"&gt;a decree issued by Franco&lt;/a&gt;. The same year &lt;a href=\"Telmo%20Zarra\"&gt;Telmo Zarra&lt;/a&gt; made his debut. He went on to score 294 goals in all competitions for Athletic. His 38 goals in the &lt;a href=\"1950%E2%80%9351%20La%20Liga\"&gt;1950\u201351&lt;/a&gt; season stood as a record for 60 years.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1942%E2%80%9343%20La%20Liga\"&gt;1943&lt;/a&gt;, the club won a &lt;a href=\"double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt; and retained the Copa in both &lt;a href=\"1944%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final\"&gt;1944&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1945%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final\"&gt;1945&lt;/a&gt;. During the early 1950s, the club featured the legendary forward line of Zarra, Panizo, &lt;a href=\"Rafa%20Iriondo\"&gt;Rafa Iriondo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venancio%20Garc%C3%ADa\"&gt;Venancio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agust%C3%ADn%20Ga%C3%ADnza\"&gt;Agust\u00edn Ga\u00ednza&lt;/a&gt;. They helped the club win another Copa del Generalisimo in &lt;a href=\"1950%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final\"&gt;1950&lt;/a&gt;. Coach &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Dau%C4%8D%C3%ADk\"&gt;Ferdinand Dau\u010d\u00edk&lt;/a&gt; led the team to another double in &lt;a href=\"1955-56%20La%20Liga\"&gt;1956&lt;/a&gt; and to more Copa victories in &lt;a href=\"1955%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final\"&gt;1955&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1958%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final\"&gt;1958&lt;/a&gt;. In 1956 the club also made their debut in the &lt;a href=\"1956%E2%80%9357%20European%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 1960s were dominated by Real Madrid, and Atl\u00e9tico only had a single Copa del Rey win in &lt;a href=\"1969%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final\"&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt;, although the decade saw the emergence of a club legend, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20%C3%81ngel%20Iribar\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Iribar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 1970s were not much better, with only another single Copa del Rey win in &lt;a href=\"1973%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final\"&gt;1973&lt;/a&gt;. In December 1976, before a game against Real Sociedad, Iribar and Sociedad captain &lt;a href=\"Inaxio%20Kortabarria\"&gt;Inaxio Kortabarria&lt;/a&gt; carried out the &lt;a href=\"Ikurri%C3%B1a\"&gt;Ikurri\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;, the Basque flag, and placed it ceremonially on the centre-circle \u2013 this was the first public display of the flag since the death of &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Franco\"&gt;Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt;. In 1977, the club reached &lt;a href=\"1977%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;the final&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, only losing on away goals to &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;. By then the Franco regime also ended and the club reverted to using the name \"Athletic\".\nThe Clemente years.\nIn 1981, &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Clemente\"&gt;Javier Clemente&lt;/a&gt; became manager. He put together one of the most successful teams in the club's history. In 1983 the club won La Liga, and in 1984 they won a La Liga/Copa del Rey double. In 1985 and 1986, Athletic finished third and fourth respectively. Clemente's Athletic acquired notoriety for its aggressive style of play. The club has failed to win a major trophy since the success of the era. A succession of coaches that included Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Iribar, &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Kendall\"&gt;Howard Kendall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jupp%20Heynckes\"&gt;Jupp Heynckes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Javier%20Irureta\"&gt;Javier Irureta&lt;/a&gt; and even a returning Clemente failed to reproduce his success.\nThe Fern\u00e1ndez era.\nIn 1998, coach &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Fern%C3%A1ndez\"&gt;Luis Fern\u00e1ndez&lt;/a&gt; led the club to second in La Liga and &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; qualification. Fern\u00e1ndez benefited from the club adopting a more flexible approach to the \"&lt;a href=\"cantera\"&gt;cantera&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1995, Athletic had signed &lt;a href=\"Joseba%20Etxeberria\"&gt;Joseba Etxeberria&lt;/a&gt; from regional rivals Real Sociedad, causing considerable bad feeling between the two clubs. Etxeberria was a prominent member of the 1997\u201398 squad, along with &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Alkorta\"&gt;Rafael Alkorta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Julen%20Guerrero\"&gt;Julen Guerrero&lt;/a&gt;.\n21st century.\nThe club narrowly avoided relegation during the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20La%20Liga\"&gt;2005\u201306&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga\"&gt;2006\u201307&lt;/a&gt; seasons, the latter being the worst in the club's history. In the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;Copa del Rey&lt;/a&gt;, they reached their first final in 24 years, &lt;a href=\"2009%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final\"&gt;losing 4\u20131 to Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Athletic%20Bilbao%20season\"&gt;2011\u201312 season&lt;/a&gt;, Athletic's new president, former player &lt;a href=\"Josu%20Urrutia\"&gt;Josu Urrutia&lt;/a&gt;, brought in coach &lt;a href=\"Marcelo%20Bielsa\"&gt;Marcelo Bielsa&lt;/a&gt;; Athletic advanced to their first European final since 1977, losing 3\u20130 to Spanish rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on 9 May in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final\"&gt;2012 UEFA Europa League Final&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Na%C8%9Bional%C4%83\"&gt;Arena Na\u021bional\u0103&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;. They also reached the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final\"&gt;2012 Copa del Rey Final&lt;/a&gt;, losing again to Barcelona.\nAfter star midfielder &lt;a href=\"Javi%20Mart%C3%ADnez\"&gt;Javi Mart\u00ednez&lt;/a&gt; moved to &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;FC Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;, Athletic were eliminated from the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%23Group%20I\"&gt;2012\u201313 Europa League group stage&lt;/a&gt;, and were knocked out of the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;Copa del Rey&lt;/a&gt; by Basque club &lt;a href=\"SD%20Eibar\"&gt;Eibar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B\"&gt;third tier&lt;/a&gt;. Relegation was a threat until the end of the season, and the &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20La%20Liga\"&gt;final league game&lt;/a&gt; at the \"old\" San Mam\u00e9s ended in defeat. Athletic would soon move to a new stadium, albeit in a partially completed state. Bielsa promoted young defender &lt;a href=\"Aymeric%20Laporte\"&gt;Aymeric Laporte&lt;/a&gt; into the side, while striker &lt;a href=\"Fernando%20Llorente\"&gt;Fernando Llorente&lt;/a&gt; completed a &lt;a href=\"free%20transfer%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;free transfer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Bielsa, &lt;a href=\"Ernesto%20Valverde\"&gt;Ernesto Valverde&lt;/a&gt; returned for a second spell as manager, and he signed or brought through several new players as Athletic came fourth in &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20La%20Liga\"&gt;the league&lt;/a&gt;, meaning a &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; campaign. &lt;a href=\"Ander%20Herrera\"&gt;Ander Herrera&lt;/a&gt; transferred to Manchester United for \u20ac36 million deal at the end of the season.\nAthletic had a triumphant first full-capacity match in the new &lt;a href=\"San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium%20%282013%29\"&gt;San Mam\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt; as they defeated &lt;a href=\"S.S.C.%20Napoli\"&gt;Napoli&lt;/a&gt; to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; group stage, however they could only finish 3rd in the group. Athletic reached the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final\"&gt;2015 Copa del Rey Final&lt;/a&gt;, but once again lost to Barcelona, 3\u20131.\nIn the first leg of the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a\"&gt;2015 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; at San Mam\u00e9s, Athletic defeated Barcelona 4\u20130, with &lt;a href=\"Aritz%20Aduriz\"&gt;Aritz Aduriz&lt;/a&gt; scoring a hat-trick. In the return leg at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Nou\"&gt;Camp Nou&lt;/a&gt;, Athletic hung on with a 1\u20131 draw to win their first trophy since 1984. Aduriz finished with 36 goals in all competitions. Athletic advanced to the quarter-finals in the &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt; where they were only defeated on penalties by the holders and eventual repeat winners &lt;a href=\"Sevilla%20FC\"&gt;Sevilla FC&lt;/a&gt;.\nValverde left his position at the end of the 2016\u201317 season after four years. It was confirmed that his successor would be former player &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20%C3%81ngel%20Ziganda\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Ziganda&lt;/a&gt;, moving up from Bilbao Athletic. On 29 November the club suffered a shock defeat to &lt;a href=\"SD%20Formentera\"&gt;SD Formentera&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Copa%20del%20Rey%23Round%20of%2032\"&gt;domestic cup&lt;/a&gt;. At the conclusion of a poor season overall, Ziganda was dismissed and &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20Berizzo\"&gt;Eduardo Berizzo&lt;/a&gt; was appointed. However, his spell was even less fruitful and in December 2018, having won just two of his fifteen matches at the helm and with the team in &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20La%20Liga\"&gt;the relegation zone&lt;/a&gt;, Berizzo was dismissed. B-team coach &lt;a href=\"Gaizka%20Garitano\"&gt;Gaizka Garitano&lt;/a&gt; took over and oversaw an improvement in results, with the club moving well out of danger and narrowly missing out on a Europa League spot on the last day.\nThe beginning of the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20La%20Liga\"&gt;2019\u201320&lt;/a&gt; season saw more consistent results. After the first five games of the season, the \"Lions\" sat at the top of the table, their best start in 26 years. That form could not be maintained, and by the halfway point they had slipped to mid-table after several draws. However, in the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;Copa del Rey&lt;/a&gt;, they survived two penalty shootouts against second-tier opponents and then defeated Barcelona to reach the semi-finals. The club then defeated &lt;a href=\"Granada%20CF\"&gt;Granada CF&lt;/a&gt; in the semi-final on away goals to meet local rivals Real Sociedad in the final \u2013 which was then postponed due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Spain\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic in Spain&lt;/a&gt;, both clubs happy to delay in the hope of supporters being able to attend the historic Basque derby occasion. This did not come to pass, and &lt;a href=\"2020%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final\"&gt;the final&lt;/a&gt; was eventually played in an empty stadium in 3 April 2021, Real Sociedad emerging winners by a 1\u20130 scoreline. By that time, Aduriz had finally retired from playing, Garitano had been replaced as coach by &lt;a href=\"Marcelino%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Toral\"&gt;Marcelino&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a\"&gt;2020\u201321 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; originally intended to follow the delayed cup final was contested, Athletic defeating Real Madrid then Barcelona to claim the trophy. They also defeated Levante in the semi-final of the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;2020\u201321 Copa del Rey&lt;/a&gt; to reach the final on 17 April 2021, making them the only team to take part in the showpiece event twice in as many weeks; however, Athletic lost &lt;a href=\"2021%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final\"&gt;that final&lt;/a&gt; as well, to Barcelona by a 4\u20130 scoreline. In October 2021, a report from the &lt;a href=\"International%20Centre%20for%20Sports%20Studies\"&gt;International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES)&lt;/a&gt; showed that Athletic Bilbao and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Desna%20Chernihiv\"&gt;Desna Chernihiv&lt;/a&gt; (Ukraine) were the only teams in European continental competitions without foreign players.\nClub colours.\nAthletic began playing in an improvised white kit, but in the 1902\u201303 season, the club's first official strip became half-blue, half-white shirts similar to those worn by &lt;a href=\"Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackburn Rovers&lt;/a&gt;, which were donated by Juan Moser. Later, a young student from Bilbao named Juan Elorduy, who was spending Christmas 1909 in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, was charged by the club to buy 25 new shirts, but was unable to find enough. Waiting for the ship back to Bilbao and empty handed, Elorduy realised that the colours of the local team &lt;a href=\"Southampton%20F.C.\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt; matched the colours of the City of Bilbao, and bought 50 shirts to take with him. Upon arriving in Bilbao, the club's directors decided almost immediately to change the team's strip to the new colours, and since 1910, Athletic Club have played in red and white stripes. Of the 50 shirts bought by Elorduy, half were then sent to &lt;a href=\"Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid\"&gt;Atl\u00e9tico Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, where Elorduy was a committee member and a former player; it had originally begun as a youth branch of Athletic Bilbao. Before the switch from blue and white to red and white, only one other team wore red and white, &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n\"&gt;Sporting de Gij\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, since 1905.\nAthletic were one of the last major clubs who did not have the logo of an official sponsor emblazoned on their kit. In the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the Copa del Rey of 2004\u201305, the shirt sported the word \"&lt;a href=\"Euskadi\"&gt;Euskadi&lt;/a&gt;\" in green in exchange for hundreds of thousands of euros from the &lt;a href=\"Basque%20Government\"&gt;Basque Government&lt;/a&gt; (Red, white and green are the &lt;a href=\"Ikurri%C3%B1a\"&gt;Basque colours&lt;/a&gt;).\nThis policy was changed in 2008, when Athletic made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Biscay\"&gt;Biscay&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Petronor\"&gt;Petronor&lt;/a&gt; oil company to wear their logo in exchange for over \u20ac2 million. In 2011, Athletic revealed a new away kit that was inspired by the &lt;a href=\"Ikurri%C3%B1a\"&gt;Basque flag&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Kutxabank\"&gt;Kutxabank&lt;/a&gt; logo now adorns the front of Athletic's kits.\nBetween 2001 and 2009 Athletic also manufactured their own playing kit, under the brand \"100% Athletic\" and utilising the small design from their centenary celebrations as a manufacturer's logo.\nCrest.\nAthletic's shield has incorporated the escutcheons of Bilbao and Biscay. From the shield of Bilbao, it takes &lt;a href=\"San%20Ant%C3%B3n%20Bridge\"&gt;the bridge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Saint%20Anthony%20the%20Great\"&gt;church of San Anton&lt;/a&gt;, and the wolves from the powerful &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Haro\"&gt;Haro family&lt;/a&gt;, who were lords of Biscay and founders of Bilbao in 1300. From the shield of Biscay, it takes the &lt;a href=\"Gernikako%20Arbola\"&gt;Gernikako Arbola&lt;/a&gt; (Guernica's tree) and the &lt;a href=\"Cross%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;cross of Saint Andrew&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"saltire\"&gt;saltire&lt;/a&gt;s). Its first documented use dates from 1922.\nThe first official club crest was a blue circle surrounded by a belt with the letters A and C in the centre in white (as the club colours were at that point). The second was from 1910, consisting of a red-and-white flag (newly adopted as the shirt colours) with a red square in the top left corner, containing the initials of the club in white. The third, from 1913, involved the same flag, but in this case shown on a pole wrapped around a football (this is very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Real%20Sociedad\"&gt;Real Sociedad&lt;/a&gt; crest still in use today, ignoring the crown of royal patronage).\nThe first version of the current crest, roughly an inverted triangular shield shape with a section of red-and-white stripes and a section of local motifs, is from 1922; this was a really simple version which was adapted several times, some of which closely resembled the crest of &lt;a href=\"Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid\"&gt;Atl\u00e9tico Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, originally a branch of the Bilbao club. Finally, in 1941 the first version of the current shield was created, but the name \"Atl\u00e9tico Bilbao\" was used when &lt;a href=\"General%20Francisco%20Franco\"&gt;General Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt; outlawed all non-Spanish names during his fascist reign. In 1972, the club added full colour to the design and recovered the original English \"Athletic Club\" name. In 2008, the shape of the shield was slightly altered and a new \"Athletic Club\" typeface was introduced.\nPresidency.\nThe current board is presided by &lt;a href=\"Aitor%20Elizegi\"&gt;Aitor Elizegi&lt;/a&gt;, businessman by profession, whose candidacy was successful during the elections in December 2018, succeeding the previous president, &lt;a href=\"Josu%20Urrutia\"&gt;Josu Urrutia&lt;/a&gt;. There were a total of 19,340 votes. Elizegi was the winner with 9,264 votes (47.9%), while opposition candidate Alberto Uribe-Echevarr\u00eda garnered 9,179 (47.46%). 781 (4.04%) members voted blank and 116 (0.6%) remaining votes were considered invalid.\nThe board of the Athletic Club is composed of the following directors:\nStatistics and records.\nStatistics.\n\"Institutional information:\"\n\"Best positions\"\n\"Goals records\"\n\"Players records\"\nLezama facilities.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lezama%20Facilities\"&gt;Lezama Facilities&lt;/a&gt; is the complex where all of the categories of Athletic train. It was opened in the 1971\u201372 season, under the presidency of Felix Or\u00e1a. At present, facilities include, \"inter alia\", five natural grass fields, a gymnasium, a pediment, a medical center and a residence for young players. Lezama has undergone remodeling since 1995 under the presidency of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arrate with the construction of new roads and parking entry and exit able to absorb the large number of vehicles that come every day, and a platform cover bringing greater convenience to fans attending the matches of the youth teams and other youth football teams.\nThese facilities are located in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Lezama\"&gt;Lezama&lt;/a&gt;, approximately ten miles from &lt;a href=\"Bilbao\"&gt;Bilbao&lt;/a&gt;.\nFuture.\nThe Board has given the green light to the so-called \"Lezama Master Plan\", which was founded with the purpose of modernizing the structures of both the youth teams and first team. The \"Plan\" is the result of a rigorous study of the basic needs for the future of the Athletic Club. The work will take place over the course of two to three years and its budget is around \u20ac12 million. The Club is committed to consolidate its cantera structure, which is the basis for the future of the Club and in this regard Lezama will be expanded to classrooms for youth work in the lower categories and create an audiovisual department."
