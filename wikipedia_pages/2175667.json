    "text": "Grant County Airport is a county-owned, public-use &lt;a href=\"airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grant%20County%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Grant County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. It is located 10\u00a0&lt;a href=\"nautical%20mile\"&gt;nautical mile&lt;/a&gt;s (12\u00a0&lt;a href=\"mile\"&gt;mi&lt;/a&gt;, 19\u00a0&lt;a href=\"kilometre\"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;) southeast of the &lt;a href=\"central%20business%20district\"&gt;central business district&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silver%20City%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Silver City, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The airport is mostly used for &lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt;, but is also served by one commercial airline. Service is subsidized by the &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Air%20Service\"&gt;Essential Air Service&lt;/a&gt; program.\nIt is included in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Plan%20of%20Integrated%20Airport%20Systems\"&gt;National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems&lt;/a&gt; for 2011\u20132015, which &lt;a href=\"FAA%20airport%20categories\"&gt;categorized&lt;/a&gt; it as a \"non-primary commercial service\" airport (between 2,500 and 10,000 enplanements per year).\nFacilities and aircraft.\nGrant County Airport covers an area of 740 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s (299 &lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;ha&lt;/a&gt;) at an &lt;a href=\"elevation\"&gt;elevation&lt;/a&gt; of 5,446 feet (1,660 m) above &lt;a href=\"mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;mean sea level&lt;/a&gt;. It has four &lt;a href=\"runway\"&gt;runway&lt;/a&gt;s, including one &lt;a href=\"asphalt\"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt; paved runway 8/26 measuring 6,802 by 100 feet (2,073 x 30 m). The remaining three runways have &lt;a href=\"soil\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; surfaces: 17/35 is 5,473 by 75 feet (1,668 x 23 m), 12/30 is 4,675 by 75 feet (1,425 x 23 m), and 3/21 is 4,537 by 80 feet (1,383 x 24 m).\nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2018, the airport had 5,675 aircraft operations, an average of 16 per day: 63% &lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt;, 22% &lt;a href=\"airline\"&gt;scheduled commercial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;1% &lt;a href=\"air%20taxi\"&gt;air taxi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;1% &lt;a href=\"military%20aviation\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;. At that time there were 26 aircraft based at this airport: 81% single-&lt;a href=\"aircraft%20engine\"&gt;engine&lt;/a&gt;, 15% multi-engine, and &lt;1% &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2020 the terminal building, named for David D, Diaz, underwent an expansion and rehabilitation.\nAirline and destinations.\nAdvanced Air operates &lt;a href=\"Raytheon%20King%20Air%20350\"&gt;Raytheon King Air 350&lt;/a&gt; turboprop aircraft on all flights. The aircraft has eight seats arranged in an executive configuration.\nHistorical airline service.\nThe Grant County Airport was dedicated on November 30, 1951, serving the communities of Silver City, Hurley, Lordsburg and Deming, New Mexico, as well as smaller communities in the so-called \"Mining District,\" including Arenas Valley, Fort Bayard, Central (now Santa Clara), Bayard, and Santa Rita.The next day, on December 1, &lt;a href=\"Frontier%20Airlines\"&gt;Frontier Airlines&lt;/a&gt; began operating flights from the airport as a stop on their route from El Paso to Phoenix, which also included stops at Clifton, Safford, and Tucson, Arizona. Before the opening of the Grant County Airport, the airline was serving local airports in Deming, NM and Lordsburg, NM; however, service to those cities was then discontinued. By 1956 the route to Phoenix was modified to originate in Albuquerque rather than El Paso and service to Clifton and Safford was later discontinued which made for nonstop flights from Silver City to Tucson and Phoenix. At that time and on into the mid-1960s, the airline was flying the &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20DC-3\"&gt;Douglas DC-3&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Frontier served the airport with larger &lt;a href=\"Convair%20340\"&gt;Convair 340&lt;/a&gt; prop aircraft followed by &lt;a href=\"Convair%20580\"&gt;Convair 580&lt;/a&gt; turboprops. Frontier's flights to Tucson and Phoenix were discontinued in 1974 and a small commuter carrier, Zia Airlines, began flights to Albuquerque with &lt;a href=\"Handley%20Page%20Jetstream\"&gt;Handley Page Jetstream&lt;/a&gt; propjets in 1976. In the midst of growing into an all jet airline, Frontier ended their service in late 1979. Zia Airlines went out of business in early 1980 and &lt;a href=\"Air%20Midwest\"&gt;Air Midwest&lt;/a&gt; began operating later that year with flights to Albuquerque using &lt;a href=\"Swearingen%20Metroliner\"&gt;Swearingen Metroliner&lt;/a&gt; aircraft. Another commuter, Airways of New Mexico, operated flights to El Paso for a short time in 1980 as well. &lt;a href=\"Mesa%20Airlines\"&gt;Mesa Airlines&lt;/a&gt; came to Silver City with &lt;a href=\"Beechcraft%2099\"&gt;Beechcraft 99&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beechcraft%201900D\"&gt;Beechcraft 1900D&lt;/a&gt; aircraft from Albuquerque in 1985 at which time Air Midwest ended their service. Mesa's flights continued for 20 years until an &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Air%20Service\"&gt;Essential Air Service&lt;/a&gt; (EAS) contract was awarded to &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes%20Airlines\"&gt;Great Lakes Airlines&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. Great Lakes started service with flights to Albuquerque, also using Beech 1900D's, but switched the flights to Phoenix in late 2012. Great Lakes ended all service in late 2014 and the EAS contract was then awarded to &lt;a href=\"Boutique%20Air\"&gt;Boutique Air&lt;/a&gt; which began service in early 2015. Boutique provided flights to both Albuquerque and Phoenix using &lt;a href=\"Pilatus%20PC-12\"&gt;Pilatus PC-12&lt;/a&gt; aircraft for four years until the EAS contract was then transferred to Advanced Air. Advanced Air began service in early 2019 with similar service to Albuquerque and Phoenix but uses a larger, multi engine, &lt;a href=\"Beechcraft%20Super%20King%20Air\"&gt;Beechcraft Super King Air&lt;/a&gt; model 350. Two other commuter airlines that served the Silver City to El Paso market for short periods were Aztec Airlines in 1966 and Turner Air in 1985."
