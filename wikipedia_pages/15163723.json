    "text": "The Gross Windg\u00e4llen is a 3,187\u00a0m high &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Glarus%20Alps\"&gt;Glarus Alps&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking the valley of the &lt;a href=\"Reuss%20%28river%29\"&gt;Reuss&lt;/a&gt; in the canton of &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Uri\"&gt;Uri&lt;/a&gt;. The name Gross Windg\u00e4llen derives from G\u00e4lle or gellen, meaning as much as wailing, shrilling or whistling.\nGeography.\nThe massif of the Gross Wing\u00e4llen lies between two parallel valleys, the &lt;a href=\"Sch%C3%A4chental\"&gt;Sch\u00e4chental&lt;/a&gt; on the north side and the &lt;a href=\"Maderanertal\"&gt;Maderanertal&lt;/a&gt; on the south side, both converging to the Reuss on the west at approximately 500 metres above sea level or 2,700\u00a0m below the summit. On the north side, the massif encloses a small valley, the Brunnital, which belong to the Sch\u00e4chental, thus forming an amphitheatre of several summits above 3,000\u00a0m, including the &lt;a href=\"Gross%20Ruchen\"&gt;Gross Ruchen&lt;/a&gt; on the east; the north wall of the Gross Ruchen being connected with that of the Gross Windg\u00e4llen.\nSeveral glaciers can be found on the southern side of the mountain, among which the St\u00e4felfirn, located east of the summit. The north-west face is very steep and has no glaciers, it overlooks the small lake of &lt;a href=\"Seewli\"&gt;Seewli&lt;/a&gt; (2,028\u00a0m). Two kilometres south-west of the Gross Windg\u00e4llen lies the &lt;a href=\"Chli%20Windg%C3%A4llen\"&gt;Chli Windg\u00e4llen&lt;/a&gt; (2,986\u00a0m).\nThe closest locality is Golzern on its southern flanks at 1,400\u00a0m, from where the Gross Windg\u00e4llen is usually climbed. The Windg\u00e4llen hut, owned by the Academic Alpine Club of Zurich is located higher at 2,032\u00a0m. From there starts the normal route to the top, via the St\u00e4felfirn.\nClimbing.\nThe first climbing was made in 1848 by a mountain guide from Uri, Josef Maria Tresch-Exer together with Melchior Tresch. This enabled Tresch-Exer for a subsequent climb to the summit together with Georg Hoffmann which took place ten days later."
