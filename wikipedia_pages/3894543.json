    "text": "Vijay Singh is a former &lt;a href=\"Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;an politician of &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n descent, who represented the &lt;a href=\"Vuda%20%28Open%20Constituency%2C%20Fiji%29\"&gt;Vuda&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Open%20constituencies\"&gt;Open Constituency&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Fiji\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Fiji%20Labour%20Party\"&gt;Fiji Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; (FLP) from 2001 to 2006, having retained the seat at the &lt;a href=\"2001%20Fijian%20general%20election\"&gt;2001 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; with more than 57 percent of the votes cast.\nIn 2003, Singh was offered the portfolio of Minister for Fair Trading &amp; Consumer Affairs, together with 13 other FLP parliamentarians who were offered cabinet positions by the Prime Minister, &lt;a href=\"Laisenia%20Qarase\"&gt;Laisenia Qarase&lt;/a&gt; but the FLP refused to accept this offer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2006%20Fijian%20general%20election\"&gt;parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; held on 6\u201313 May 2006 was marked by intrigue. The FLP replaced Singh as its candidate with then-&lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Fiji\"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Anthony\"&gt;Felix Anthony&lt;/a&gt;, on what Singh claims was an undertaking that he would be given Anthony's seat in the Senate. This did not eventuate, and Singh pursued legal action against the FLP leader, &lt;a href=\"Mahendra%20Chaudhry\"&gt;Mahendra Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt;, for reneging on the promise that he was alleged to have made. Chaudhry, for his part, denied having given any such promise."
