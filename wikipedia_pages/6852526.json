    "text": "Ottone in villa (\"Otho at his villa\", &lt;a href=\"Ryom%20Verzeichnis\"&gt;RV&lt;/a&gt; 729) is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; in three acts by &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Vivaldi\"&gt;Antonio Vivaldi&lt;/a&gt; to an Italian &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Domenico%20Lalli\"&gt;Domenico Lalli&lt;/a&gt; (the pseudonym of Sebastiano Biancardi). It was Vivaldi's first opera and premiered on 17 May 1713 at the in &lt;a href=\"Vicenza\"&gt;Vicenza&lt;/a&gt;. Lalli's pastoral drama is set in &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Rome\"&gt;ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt; and was a condensed adaptation of Francesco Maria Piccioli's satirical libretto for &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Pallavicino\"&gt;Carlo Pallavicino&lt;/a&gt;'s opera \"Messalina\" (1679). However, Lalli changed several of the characters in Piccioli's libretto. &lt;a href=\"Messalina\"&gt;Messalina&lt;/a&gt; became an invented character, Cleonilla. &lt;a href=\"Claudius\"&gt;Emperor Claudius&lt;/a&gt; became another Roman emperor, &lt;a href=\"Otho\"&gt;Otho&lt;/a&gt; (Ottone), who had already appeared as a protagonist in &lt;a href=\"Claudio%20Monteverdi\"&gt;Monteverdi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea\"&gt;L'incoronazione di Poppea&lt;/a&gt;\" (1642) and in &lt;a href=\"George%20Frideric%20Handel\"&gt;Handel&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Agrippina%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Agrippina&lt;/a&gt;\" (1709).\nSynopsis.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Otho\"&gt;Ottone&lt;/a&gt; is in love with Cleonilla, who can't resist flirting with two young Romans, Ostilio and Caio. Ostilio is in reality a woman, Tullia, who disguised herself because she's in love with Caio. She plans to kill Cleonilla out of jealousy, but she first tries to dissuade her from her relation with Caio. Caio sees the meeting and misinterprets it as a romantic encounter. He warns Ottone, who commands him to kill Ostilio. Before he can execute the order, Ostilio reveals himself to be Tullia. Cleonilla claims to have always known it, to conciliate Ottone. He believes her and the opera closes with the marriage of Tullia and Caio."
