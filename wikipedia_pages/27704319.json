His works have been displayed at &lt;a href=\"Hermitage%20Museum\"&gt;The Hermitage&lt;/a&gt; and many other museums.\nHe lived in &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;, Hungary. He was married to an actress, Zinaida Zicherman, and had two daughters and two sons.\nLife.\nS\u00e1ndor Robert Zicherman was born on 6 April 1935 in &lt;a href=\"Uzhhorod\"&gt;Uzhhorod&lt;/a&gt;. He spent his childhood and started his studies in &lt;a href=\"Berehove\"&gt;Berehove&lt;/a&gt; (Beregsz\u00e1sz) which is now located at the Ukrainian-Hungarian border.\nIn 1957, as a self-taught painter, he participated in his first exhibition at the Gallery of Fine Arts in Uzhgorod. In 1958 he was accepted to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lviv%20National%20Academy%20of%20Arts\"&gt;College of Arts and Crafts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lwow\"&gt;Lwow&lt;/a&gt; and started his professional studies at the faculty of monumental painting. After the first year he moved to &lt;a href=\"Leningrad\"&gt;Leningrad&lt;/a&gt; where he continued his studies at the Vera Mukhina Higher School of Art and Design (now the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg%20State%20Art%20and%20Industry%20Academy\"&gt;Saint Petersburg State Art and Industry Academy&lt;/a&gt;), also at the monumental painting faculty.\nAfter graduating in 1964, Zicherman moved to &lt;a href=\"Perm%2C%20Russia\"&gt;Perm&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20Mountains\"&gt;Ural region&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked for the Fine Arts Foundation on a number of commissions, as a specialist in monumental art. In Perm and the surrounding region he produced a number of &lt;a href=\"fresco\"&gt;fresco&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mosaic\"&gt;mosaic&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sgraffito\"&gt;sgraffito&lt;/a&gt;s, and ceramic &lt;a href=\"high%20relief\"&gt;high relief&lt;/a&gt;s, and also three large gobelins (tapestries after the manner of the &lt;a href=\"Gobelins%20Manufactory\"&gt;Gobelins&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn addition to executing works linked to architecture, Zicherman also worked for Perm Television and the Perm theatres. In 1966, after participating in the art exhibition \"Socialist Urals\" sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Russian Soviet Republic&lt;/a&gt; he was accepted to the &lt;a href=\"USSR%20Union%20of%20Artists\"&gt;USSR Union of Artists&lt;/a&gt; as a candidate member, and in 1975 as a full member. Between 1969 and 1972 he worked and lived in a number of different cities and regions including Lviv, &lt;a href=\"J%C5%ABrmala\"&gt;J\u016brmala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riga\"&gt;Riga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elista\"&gt;Elista&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1972 Zicherman moved to &lt;a href=\"Tolyatti\"&gt;Tolyatti&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Stavropol-on-Volga) at the invitation of the city administration for the organization of cultural and artistic life. He contributed to the founding of the Tolyatti Lyceum of Arts art gallery, and was instrumental in founding the Tolyatti branch of the Union of Artists. In 1987, he organized Russia's first stone-carving sculpture symposium, in Tolyatti.\nZicherman later moved to &lt;a href=\"Samara%2C%20Russia\"&gt;Samara&lt;/a&gt;, where he married Zinaida Sokolova, and in 1989 to &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;. Of this move to &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, he said that \"[A]ll of us are of mixed nationalities, I do not know a single person who is one hundred percent Russian or &lt;a href=\"Mordovia\"&gt;Mordovia&lt;/a&gt;n\". He described himself as a Hungarian artist of Russian origin. In Budapest, he and his wife opened a Russian theater and studio at the Russian embassy.\nWorks.\nBy 1989 Sandor Zicherman had participated in great number All-Soviet and All-Russian exhibitions, including exhibitions representing Soviet art abroad (Hungary, Czechoslovakia, NDK, Poland). His exhibits included paintings to graphics, medals, ceramics, sculptures, and tapestries. His mosaics, sgraffitos and memorials are still on show in many Russian cities. In addition to participating in group exhibitions, by 1989 he had had more than 30 personal exhibitions in various cities of the Soviet Union and also participated in 13 different Soviet or international two-month symposiums. Since his move to Budapest in 1990 he has participated in more than 60 group and personal exhibitions in Budapest and other Hungarian cities, as well as a great number of European countries.\nZicherman does not adhere to a particular genre; among his works and graphics are portraits, &lt;a href=\"avant-garde\"&gt;avant-garde&lt;/a&gt; pieces, and classical landscapes, employing a variety of stylistic devices such as &lt;a href=\"cubo-futurism\"&gt;cubo-futurism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"post-impressionism\"&gt;post-impressionism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"realism%20%28visual%20arts%29\"&gt;realism&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years, he has produced many works in the &lt;a href=\"Depictions%20of%20nudity\"&gt;nu&lt;/a&gt; genre.\nHis work is represented in &lt;a href=\"Hermitage%20Museum\"&gt;The Hermitage&lt;/a&gt;, the Samara State Fine Arts Museum, the Tolyatti Art Museum, the Museum of Regional Ethnography in Perm, the Museum of Fine Arts of the &lt;a href=\"Udmurt%20Republic\"&gt;Udmurt Republic&lt;/a&gt;, the Technical Museum of Autovaz in Tolyatti, the Museum of Fine Arts of the &lt;a href=\"Mari%20El%20Republic\"&gt;Mari El Republic&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Yoshkar-Ola\"&gt;Yoshkar-Ola&lt;/a&gt;, the Joseph Boksay Fine Art Museum of Transcarpathia in Uzhgorod, the Kalmyk Fine Art Museum in Elista, the Museum of Medal Art in &lt;a href=\"Wroclaw\"&gt;Wroclaw&lt;/a&gt;, the War History Museum in Budapest, and many other museums in Europe.\nEvery year, Zicherman returned to Russia, where he held a regular solo exhibition. In 2006, there was an exhibition of his works in Tolyatti, dedicated to the fortieth anniversary of &lt;a href=\"AvtoVAZ\"&gt;AvtoVAZ&lt;/a&gt;. In 2007, the show was held in Samara.\nZicherman's work has sometimes been the target of thieves. In the early 1990s, he was one of the organizers of an exhibit from whence 171 pieces were stolen. In Samara, a plaque by Zicherman in honor of the 100th birthday of &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Artist\"&gt;People's Artist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20Shebuev\"&gt;George Shebuev&lt;/a&gt; was stolen, and in Tolyatti, a two-meter pink marble sculpture by Zicherman was stolen too."
