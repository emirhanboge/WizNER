Having familiarized himself with the state of affairs in the Directorate, he came to the conclusion that there was a huge shortage of communications equipment in the troops. From October 1940 to June 1941, he repeatedly addressed reports on the need to urgently rectify matters to People's Commissar of Defense &lt;a href=\"Semyon%20Timoshenko\"&gt;Semyon Timoshenko&lt;/a&gt;, Chiefs of the General Staff &lt;a href=\"Kirill%20Meretskov\"&gt;Kirill Meretskov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Georgy%20Zhukov\"&gt;Georgy Zhukov&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman of the Defense Committee under the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20People%27s%20Commissars%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kliment%20Voroshilov\"&gt;Kliment Voroshilov&lt;/a&gt;, but the measures he proposed did not have been implemented. As a result, from the first days of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;Great Patriotic War&lt;/a&gt;, the lack of proper communication at all levels of troops became one of the important reasons for losses in command and control of troops and military defeats.\nGreat Patriotic War, arrest, repression.\nDismissed from office on July 22, 1941. According to the memoirs of the future &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20of%20the%20branch\"&gt;Marshal of the Signal Corps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Peresypkin\"&gt;Ivan Peresypkin&lt;/a&gt;, this happened during the report of Nikolai Gapich to &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt; on the state of communications in the troops.

The front was reorganized into the &lt;a href=\"Reserve%20Front\"&gt;Reserve Front&lt;/a&gt;, and the new front commander, Georgy Zhukov, who arrived, appointed General Ivan Bulychev as the front commander, and Nikolai Gapich as his deputy. Arrested on August 6, 1941.\nHe was under investigation for a long time. At first, he was accused of criminal leadership in the work of his administration, that he did not supply the army with the required amount of communication means, in the war with Germany he did not meet the needs of the front and was unable to establish uninterrupted communication with the fronts.

Even later, accusations were added of working for Japanese intelligence during the Civil War. Then Nikolay Gapich retracted all confessions. In view of the complete absurdity, the charges of conspiracy and espionage were dropped from him. By order of the People's Commissariat of Defense of the Soviet Union on January 29, 1944, he was dismissed from the Red Army.\nAfter 11 years of being under investigation in prison, on August 26, 1952, by the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Collegium%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, under Article 193, paragraph 17, was sentenced to 10 years in a &lt;a href=\"correctional%20labour%20camp\"&gt;correctional labour camp&lt;/a&gt;.

Rehabilitated on July 28, 1953. On August 15 of the same year, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union canceled its decision to deprive Nikolay Gapich of his military rank, and he was reinstated in the Soviet Army.

He lived in Moscow, worked in the apparatus of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Communications%20%28Soviet%20Union%29\"&gt;Ministry of Communications of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; since 1956 as the head of the inspection, since 1961 \u2013 as the head of the 1st Department.\nHe was buried at the Golovinskoye Cemetery in Moscow."
