As that left a gap in &lt;a href=\"Meistriliiga\"&gt;Meistriliiga&lt;/a&gt;, it was filled with a temporary club FC Viljandi, which was mostly composed by the same players that previously played for Tulevik.\nThe club was withdrawn from the championship after the 2012 season, when Tulevik won promotion to &lt;a href=\"Esiliiga\"&gt;Esiliiga&lt;/a&gt;, the second highest division of Estonia."
