    "text": "The 2015 Super League season, known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Utility\"&gt;First Utility&lt;/a&gt; Super League XX for sponsorship reasons, was the 20th &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; season since the &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in 1996. Twelve teams competed over 23 rounds, including the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weekend\"&gt;Magic Weekend&lt;/a&gt;, after which the eight highest entered the play-offs for a place in the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Super%20League%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;Grand Final&lt;/a&gt;. The four lowest teams entered the Super League Qualifying Play-off, along with the four highest &lt;a href=\"Championship%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt; teams, to decide which will play in &lt;a href=\"Super%20League%20XXI\"&gt;Super League XXI&lt;/a&gt;. The regular season started in February 2015 and culminated with the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Super%20League%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;grand final&lt;/a&gt; on 10 October.\n&lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds Rhinos&lt;/a&gt; became only the 3rd team to complete the treble after defeating &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Warriors\"&gt;Wigan Warriors&lt;/a&gt; 22-20 in front of a new record attendance of 73,512 at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt; to win their 7th &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt; title.\nTeams.\nSuper League XX is the first year since 2008 in which there is a promotion and relegation with the Championship. Super League has been reduced to 12 teams as part of the re-structuring of Super League and the &lt;a href=\"Championship%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt;.\nEleven teams in Super League are from the North of England: five teams, &lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Wolves\"&gt;Warrington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20R.F.C.\"&gt;St. Helens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salford%20Red%20Devils\"&gt;Salford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Warriors\"&gt;Wigan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Widnes%20Vikings\"&gt;Widnes&lt;/a&gt;, west of &lt;a href=\"the%20Pennines\"&gt;the Pennines&lt;/a&gt; in the historic county of Lancashire and six teams, &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Giants\"&gt;Huddersfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wakefield%20Trinity\"&gt;Wakefield Trinity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castleford%20Tigers\"&gt;Castleford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hull%20Kingston%20Rovers\"&gt;Hull Kingston Rovers&lt;/a&gt;, to the east in Yorkshire. &lt;a href=\"Catalans%20Dragons\"&gt;Catalans Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Perpignan\"&gt;Perpignan&lt;/a&gt;, France, are the only team outside the North of England. With &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Bulls\"&gt;Bradford Bulls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"London%20Broncos\"&gt;London Broncos&lt;/a&gt; being relegated last season, this leaves St Helens, Wigan Warriors, Warrington Wolves and Leeds Rhinos as the only teams to have played in every season of Super League since 1996.\nStandings.\nRegular season.\nThe 2015 Super League season sees teams play each other home and away, and one team for a third time at the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weekend\"&gt;Magic Weekend&lt;/a&gt;.
