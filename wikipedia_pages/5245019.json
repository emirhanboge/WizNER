    "text": "Club Deportivo Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba, known simply as Godoy Cruz, is an &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sports%20club\"&gt;sports club&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Godoy%20Cruz%2C%20Mendoza\"&gt;Godoy Cruz, Mendoza&lt;/a&gt;. The club is best known for its &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team, that plays in the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, the top level of the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Argentine football league system&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther activities practised at Godoy Cruz are &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"team%20handball\"&gt;team handball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"field%20hockey\"&gt;field hockey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"volleyball\"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nGodoy Cruz was born as an institution in 1921. It all started when a group of friends, gathered in the \"Victoria Bar\" (located opposite the departmental square at that time), decided to found a club, taking advantage of the boom at the time . Thus was born on 1 June 1921, the Club Sportivo Godoy Cruz with the novice presidency of Don Romero Garay.\nThe club was officially founded on 21 June 1921 under the name \"Sportivo Godoy Cruz\", and changed to its current name on 25 April 1930 after the fusion with \"Deportivo Bodega Antonio Tomba\". In 1959, Godoy Cruz' stadium, the [Estadio Feliciano Gambarte], was constructed. The stadium is nicknamed \"La Bodega\" (&lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; for \"wine cellar\") and holds 21,000 people.\nGodoy Cruz played in the regional league for several years before reaching the national level. The club won the Mendoza first division championship in 1944, 1947, 1950, 1951, 1954, 1968, and also in 1989 and 1990 that qualified to play in the defunct \"Torneo del Interior\" national-level tournament.\nWinning the Torneo del Interior in 1994, Godoy Cruz reached the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;Primera B Nacional&lt;/a&gt; (Argentine second division) that year. After more than ten years in the second division, the club was finally promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, after winning the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20Argentine%20football\"&gt;2005\u201306 season&lt;/a&gt; of the Primera B Nacional, defeating &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Nueva%20Chicago\"&gt;Nueva Chicago&lt;/a&gt; in the final.\nTwenty-year-old &lt;a href=\"Enzo%20P%C3%A9rez\"&gt;Enzo P\u00e9rez&lt;/a&gt; scored the first goal by Godoy Cruz in the Argentine Primera, in a 1\u20131 draw with &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Belgrano\"&gt;Belgrano&lt;/a&gt; on 9 September 2006.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;2006\u201307 season&lt;/a&gt;, Godoy Cruz was relegated from the Primera after losing their promotion/relegation play-off with &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Hurac%C3%A1n\"&gt;Hurac\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;. Their stay in the second division was short, as they earned automatic promotion to the first division after finishing runners-up to &lt;a href=\"San%20Mart%C3%ADn%20de%20Tucum%C3%A1n\"&gt;San Mart\u00edn de Tucum\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20Argentine%20football\"&gt;2007\u201308 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nGodoy Cruz under &lt;a href=\"Omar%20Asad\"&gt;Omar Asad&lt;/a&gt;'s management during the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20season%23Torneo%20Clausura\"&gt;2010 Clausura&lt;/a&gt; can be considered as a turning point in the club's success in top-level competition, earning accolades from both fans and sport journalists alike. In that tournament, they achieved the best-ever point total (37) at the time, for a team indirectly affiliated to the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Argentine Football Association&lt;/a&gt; (meaning clubs under the administration of the \"Consejo Federal\" (Federal Council) branch of AFA, which are teams outside &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Greater Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rosario\"&gt;Rosario&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%2C%20Argentina\"&gt;Santa Fe&lt;/a&gt;). These results qualified them for the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Copa%20Libertadores\"&gt;2011 Copa Libertadores&lt;/a&gt;, their first appearance in this tournament.\nThe club's &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Superliga Argentina 2017/18 season&lt;/a&gt;, can be considered as the club's finest performance in Primera Division, finishing second place. After an erratic start to the season which lead to the sacking of &lt;a href=\"Lucas%20Bernardi\"&gt;Lucas Bernardi&lt;/a&gt; and his Uruguayan replacement, &lt;a href=\"Mauricio%20Larriera\"&gt;Mauricio Larriera&lt;/a&gt;, Godoy Cruz \u2014placed midtable (twelfth after Matchday 12) in league standing at the time\u2014 improvised to begin the 2018 half of the season by promoting manager &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Dabove\"&gt;Diego Dabove&lt;/a&gt; who had been coaching the reserve team since 2017. Dabove restructured the starting 11 into an efficient counter-attacking unit. Although the club rarely dominated possession statistics game after game, \"El Tomba\" amassed 56 points in 27 games played, with in-form striker &lt;a href=\"Santiago%20Garc%C3%ADa%20%28Uruguayan%20footballer%29\"&gt;Santiago Garc\u00eda&lt;/a&gt; \u2014who converted 17 goals; earning him the \"Top Goals Scored\" and \"Best Forward\" awards\u2014 helping the team set their own club record of 6 consecutive wins during a late season push (Matchday 18 to 23) to keep eventual title winners &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Boca%20Juniors%20season\"&gt;Boca Juniors&lt;/a&gt; unable to clinch the division title until the penultimate matchday. Perhaps in hindsight, Godoy Cruz's early season inconsistency and Matchday 24 draw away at &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Banfield\"&gt;Banfield&lt;/a&gt; with a last-gasp 90'+3 goal-line save by Banfield defender &lt;a href=\"Adri%C3%A1n%20Sporle\"&gt;Adri\u00e1n Sporle&lt;/a&gt;, were key factors in finishing only two points behind Boca's 58 points.\nSouth American Tournament Qualification.\nGodoy Cruz is the first club in Mendoza and the fifth indirectly-affiliated (to AFA) club to play in &lt;a href=\"CONMEBOL\"&gt;CONMEBOL&lt;/a&gt; tournaments.\nThe club's absolute debut in the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Copa%20Libertadores\"&gt;2011 Copa Libertadores&lt;/a&gt; Group 8, pitted the club against a trifecta of historic Libertadores champions: 2008 winners &lt;a href=\"LDU%20Quito\"&gt;LDU Quito&lt;/a&gt; from Ecuador, 5-time champions &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Pe%C3%B1arol\"&gt;Pe\u00f1arol&lt;/a&gt; of Uruguay, and the record-holding 7-time champions (as the most successful club in the cup's history) &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Independiente\"&gt;Independiente&lt;/a&gt;. The opening match (and resulting &lt;a href=\"2011%20Copa%20Libertadores%20Second%20Stage%23Godoy%20Cruz%20v%20LDU%20Quito\"&gt;2-1&lt;/a&gt; home win) on 17 February 2011 against &lt;a href=\"LDU%20Quito\"&gt;LDU Quito&lt;/a&gt; marked a historic moment; Godoy Cruz had become the second \"indirectly affiliated\" side ever to represent Argentina in the Copa Libertadores (&lt;a href=\"Talleres%20de%20C%C3%B3rdoba\"&gt;Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba&lt;/a&gt; qualified to the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Copa%20Libertadores\"&gt;2002 Copa Libertadores&lt;/a&gt;), however was the first of these to win their debut match. The \"Tomba\" was eliminated in the group stage.\nLater in 2011, the club debut in the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Copa%20Sudamericana\"&gt;2011 Copa Sudamericana tournament&lt;/a&gt; in the Second Stage round, defeating &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Lan%C3%BAs\"&gt;Lan\u00fas&lt;/a&gt; on an away goal tiebreaker (&lt;a href=\"2011%20Copa%20Sudamericana%20preliminary%20stages%23Godoy%20Cruz%20v%20Lan%C3%BAs\"&gt;2-2 away / 0-0 home&lt;/a&gt;), arriving until Round of 16, losing in Peru to &lt;a href=\"Club%20Universitario%20de%20Deportes\"&gt;Universitario&lt;/a&gt; on penalties (&lt;a href=\"2011%20Copa%20Sudamericana%20final%20stages%23Universitario%20v%20Godoy%20Cruz\"&gt;2-3&lt;/a&gt;; after drawing both home &amp; away legs 1-1) on 20 October 2011.\nIn 2012 he plays his second Copa Libertadores, playing in the group stage against Pe\u00f1arol, &lt;a href=\"Club%20Universidad%20de%20Chile\"&gt;Universidad de Chile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atl%C3%A9tico%20Nacional\"&gt;Atl\u00e9tico Nacional&lt;/a&gt; The \"Express\" could not pass another instance more than this phase.\nIn 2014, Godoy Cruz would play the second Copa Sudamericana, being eliminated before &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate\"&gt;Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate&lt;/a&gt; (champion of the edition of this tournament) in parties of ida (0:1) and return (0:2).\nIn 2017, Tomba will play for the third time in its history of the Copa Libertadores, fruit of the good championship that secured in 2016, and thus achieving the classification of the name of the tournament.\nRivalries.\nGodoy Cruz's classic rival is &lt;a href=\"Andes%20Talleres%20Sport%20Club\"&gt;Andes Talleres Sport Club&lt;/a&gt;, a neighborhood classic that has not been played since 1993, thanks to the \"Tomba\" promotions and the \"Azulgrana\" soccer debacle. In addition, Godoy Cruz has provincial classics such as &lt;a href=\"San%20Mart%C3%ADn%20de%20Mendoza\"&gt;San Mart\u00edn de Mendoza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Club%20Sportivo%20Independiente%20Rivadavia\"&gt;Independiente Rivadavia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gimnasia%20y%20Esgrima%20de%20Mendoza\"&gt;Gimnasia y Esgrima de Mendoza&lt;/a&gt;.
