Edinburgh won the match 26\u20135, with Angus scoring a try.\nHe played for the &lt;a href=\"Whites%20Trial\"&gt;Whites Trial&lt;/a&gt; side against the &lt;a href=\"Blues%20Trial\"&gt;Blues Trial&lt;/a&gt; side on &lt;a href=\"1910%E2%80%9311%20Scottish%20Districts%20season\"&gt;21 January 1911&lt;/a&gt;, while still with Watsonians. He scored a drop goal in a 26\u201319 win for the Whites.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped eighteen for the rugby union team between 1909 and 1920.\nRichard Bath mentions him as one of the three Scottish players \"who've gone the longest without (between) scoring a try for Scotland\" along with &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Tait\"&gt;Alan Tait&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Armstrong%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;Gary Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;. This is partly because &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; occurred in the middle of his international career, a period in which all international rugby ceased. He was first capped in 1909, scoring two tries in fourteen matches before the Great War. His next four caps came in 1920, and he scored against on 28 February 1920 \u2013 just over nine years since his previous try. Scotland won that match 19\u20130.\nCricket career.\nHe also played for the &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20cricket%20team\"&gt;Scotland national cricket team&lt;/a&gt;."
