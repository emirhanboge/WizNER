    "text": "Sophia Briscoe (&lt;a href=\"floruit\"&gt;fl.&lt;/a&gt; 1770s) was the 18th-century English author of two &lt;a href=\"epistolary%20novel\"&gt;epistolary novel&lt;/a&gt;s. Little is known of her life.\nNovels.\nBriscoe was the author of the epistolary novels \"Miss Melmoth; or the New Clarissa\" (1771) and \"The Fine Lady: A Novel\" (sometimes \"The Fine Lady; or a history of Mrs. Montague\", 1772). Briscoe was paid 20 &lt;a href=\"guinea%20%28coin%29\"&gt;guinea&lt;/a&gt;s for the copyright of \"The Fine Lady\". A German translation of \"The Fine Lady\" appeared as \"Die Frau nach der Mode\" in &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;, dated 1771.\nBoth novels are available in print-on-demand editions. \"Miss Melmoth\" was well received in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Critical%20Review\"&gt;The Critical Review&lt;/a&gt;\". The \"&lt;a href=\"Monthly%20Review%20%28London%29\"&gt;Monthly Review&lt;/a&gt;\" mildly commended it. The treatment of &lt;a href=\"incest\"&gt;incest&lt;/a&gt; in \"Miss Melmoth\" (Caroline Melmoth shies away from marrying Sir John Evelin instinctively, before discovering their relationship) has been discussed along with other aspects by at least one modern critic.\nAttribution.\nIt has been speculated that \"The Sylph\", a novel published in 1778 and attributed to &lt;a href=\"Georgiana%20Cavendish%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Devonshire\"&gt;Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire&lt;/a&gt;, was written by Briscoe. A receipt at the &lt;a href=\"British%20Library\"&gt;British Library&lt;/a&gt; suggests the publisher T. Lowndes paid Briscoe \u00a312 for it, but it is thought likelier on stylistic grounds that Briscoe simply served as an intermediary, so that the Duchess could retain her anonymity. The novel has its champions to this day.\nLetter to Pitt?\nLittle further is known of Sophia Briscoe. It is not possible to say whether the person who wrote from &lt;a href=\"Leyton\"&gt;Leyton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Essex\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger\"&gt;William Pitt the Younger&lt;/a&gt; on 14 December 1797, on the subject of taxation, was the novelist or a namesake."
