    "text": "Pope Leo XIII (; born Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi Pecci; 2 March 1810 \u2013 20 July 1903) was the head of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; from 20 February 1878 to his death in 1903. Living until the age of 93, he was the oldest pope (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"emeritus%20pope\"&gt;emeritus pope&lt;/a&gt;), and had the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20popes%20by%20length%20of%20reign\"&gt;third-longest confirmed pontificate&lt;/a&gt;, behind those of &lt;a href=\"Pius%20IX\"&gt;Pius IX&lt;/a&gt; (his immediate predecessor) and &lt;a href=\"John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical \"&lt;a href=\"Rerum%20novarum\"&gt;Rerum novarum&lt;/a&gt;\", Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of &lt;a href=\"trade%20unions\"&gt;trade unions&lt;/a&gt;, while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both &lt;a href=\"socialism\"&gt;socialism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"laissez-faire\"&gt;laissez-faire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"capitalism\"&gt;capitalism&lt;/a&gt;. He influenced &lt;a href=\"Mariology%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Mariology of the Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; and promoted both the &lt;a href=\"rosary\"&gt;rosary&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"scapular\"&gt;scapular&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the rosary, earning him the title of the \"Rosary Pope\". In addition, he approved two new Marian scapulars and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as &lt;a href=\"Mediatrix\"&gt;Mediatrix&lt;/a&gt;. He was the first pope never to have held any control over the &lt;a href=\"Papal%20States\"&gt;Papal States&lt;/a&gt;, which had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica\"&gt;Saint Peter's Basilica&lt;/a&gt; before his remains were later transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Archbasilica%20of%20Saint%20John%20Lateran\"&gt;Basilica of Saint John Lateran&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education, 1810\u20131836.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Carpineto%20Romano\"&gt;Carpineto Romano&lt;/a&gt;, near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife, Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Pecci\"&gt;Giuseppe&lt;/a&gt; and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818, he lived at home with his family \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity.\" Together with Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in &lt;a href=\"Viterbo\"&gt;Viterbo&lt;/a&gt;, where he stayed until 1824. He enjoyed &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.\nIn 1824, he and Giuseppe were called to Rome, where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife and so they stayed with him in Rome and attended the Jesuit &lt;a href=\"Collegium%20Romanum\"&gt;Collegium Romanum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1828, the 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of &lt;a href=\"secular%20clergy\"&gt;secular clergy&lt;/a&gt;, and Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order. Vincenzo studied at the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Ecclesiastical%20Academy\"&gt;Academia dei Nobili&lt;/a&gt;, mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several &lt;a href=\"cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29\"&gt;cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, on papal judgments. For his presentation, he received awards for academic excellence and gained the attention of Vatican officials. &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Secretary%20of%20State\"&gt;Cardinal Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Lambruschini\"&gt;Luigi Lambruschini&lt;/a&gt; introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome, he assisted &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Antonio%20Sala\"&gt;Cardinal Sala&lt;/a&gt; in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals. In 1836, he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and &lt;a href=\"Canon%20law%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;Canon Law&lt;/a&gt; in Rome.\nProvincial administrator, 1837\u20131843.\nOn 14 February 1837, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Gregory%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Gregory XVI&lt;/a&gt; appointed the 27-year-old Pecci as personal &lt;a href=\"prelate\"&gt;prelate&lt;/a&gt; even before he was ordained a priest on 31 December 1837 by the &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Vicar\"&gt;Vicar of Rome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29\"&gt;Cardinal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Carlo%20Odescalchi\"&gt;Carlo Odescalchi&lt;/a&gt;. He celebrated his first Mass with his priest brother Giuseppe. Shortly thereafter, &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20XVI\"&gt;Gregory XVI&lt;/a&gt; appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to &lt;a href=\"Benevento\"&gt;Benevento&lt;/a&gt;, the smallest papal province, with a population of about 20,000.\nThe main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity from widespread bandits, and pervasive &lt;a href=\"Camorra\"&gt;Mafia or Camorra&lt;/a&gt; structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with the neighboring provinces.\nPecci was first destined for &lt;a href=\"Spoleto\"&gt;Spoleto&lt;/a&gt;, a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to &lt;a href=\"Perugia\"&gt;Perugia&lt;/a&gt; with 200,000 inhabitants. His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.\nNuncio to Belgium, 1843.\nIn 1843, Pecci, at only 33, was appointed &lt;a href=\"Apostolic%20Nuncio%20to%20Belgium\"&gt;Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, a position that guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.\nOn 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him. Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighboring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the &lt;a href=\"Cologne%20Cathedral\"&gt;Cologne Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1844, upon his initiative, a &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20college%20%28Rome%29\"&gt;Belgian College&lt;/a&gt; in Rome was opened; 102 years later, in 1946, the future &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; would begin his Roman studies there. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Wiseman\"&gt;Nicholas Wiseman&lt;/a&gt;, carefully reviewing the condition of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20England%23Nineteenth%20century\"&gt;Catholic Church in that country&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the liberal minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, but he was able to win the good will of the Court not only of the pious &lt;a href=\"Louise-Marie%20of%20France\"&gt;Queen Louise&lt;/a&gt; but also of &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20I%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;King Leopold I&lt;/a&gt;, who was strongly liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Leopold%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Order of Leopold&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846\u20131878.\nPapal assistant.\nIn 1843, Pecci had been named &lt;a href=\"Assistant%20at%20the%20Pontifical%20Throne\"&gt;papal assistant&lt;/a&gt;. From 1846 to 1877, he was considered a popular and successful &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20Perugia\"&gt;Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1847, after &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20IX\"&gt;Pope Pius IX&lt;/a&gt; granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States, Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence. In 1848, &lt;a href=\"revolutions%20of%201848\"&gt;revolutionary movements&lt;/a&gt; developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.\nProvincial council.\nPecci called a provincial council to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably &lt;a href=\"Thomist\"&gt;Thomist&lt;/a&gt;s. He called on his brother &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Pecci\"&gt;Giuseppe Pecci&lt;/a&gt;, a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and to teach in Perugia instead. His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.\nCharitable activities.\nPecci developed several activities in support of &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20charities\"&gt;Catholic charities&lt;/a&gt;. He founded &lt;a href=\"homeless%20shelter\"&gt;homeless shelter&lt;/a&gt;s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses, he opened branches of a \"Bank, Monte di Piet\u00e0\", which focused on low-income people and provided &lt;a href=\"low-interest%20loan\"&gt;low-interest loan&lt;/a&gt;s. He created &lt;a href=\"soup%20kitchen\"&gt;soup kitchen&lt;/a&gt;s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Cardinals\"&gt;College of Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Cardinal-Priest\"&gt;Cardinal-Priest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"San%20Crisogono\"&gt;S. Crisogono&lt;/a&gt;. In light of continuing &lt;a href=\"earthquake\"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt;s and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Papal%20States\"&gt;Papal States&lt;/a&gt; and Italian nationalism, which aimed at the Papal States' annihilation to achieve the &lt;a href=\"Unification%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Unification of Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefending the papacy.\nPecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians. The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation according to which all episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.\nOrganizing the First Vatican Council.\nOn 8 December 1869, an &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Ecumenical%20Councils\"&gt;ecumenical council&lt;/a&gt;, which became known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Vatican%20Council\"&gt;First Vatican Council&lt;/a&gt;, was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.\nDuring the 1870s, in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as \"the mother of material civilization\" because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization and developed large-scale charities for the needy.\nIn August 1877, on the death of Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Filippo%20de%20Angelis\"&gt;Filippo de Angelis&lt;/a&gt;, Pope Pius IX appointed him &lt;a href=\"Camerlengo%20of%20the%20Holy%20Roman%20Church\"&gt;Camerlengo&lt;/a&gt;, which required him to reside in Rome.\n1878 papal conclave.\nPope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878, and during his closing years the liberal press had often insinuated that the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Kingdom of Italy&lt;/a&gt; should take a hand in the &lt;a href=\"Papal%20conclave\"&gt;conclave&lt;/a&gt; and occupy the &lt;a href=\"Apostolic%20Palace\"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt;. However the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%931878%29\"&gt;Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)&lt;/a&gt; and the sudden death of &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Emmanuel%20II\"&gt;Victor Emmanuel II&lt;/a&gt; (9 January 1878) distracted the government's attention.\nIn the conclave, the cardinals faced varied questions and discussed issues like &lt;a href=\"church-state%20relations%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;church\u2013state relations&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, specifically Italy; divisions in the church and the status of the First Vatican Council. It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878, the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII. He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.\nHe retained the administration of the Perugia see until 1880.\nPapacy, 1878\u20131903.\nAs soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world. When he firmly reasserted the &lt;a href=\"scholasticism\"&gt;scholastic&lt;/a&gt; doctrine that science and religion coexist, he required the study of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Aquinas\"&gt;Thomas Aquinas&lt;/a&gt; and opened the &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20Secret%20Archives\"&gt;Vatican Secret Archives&lt;/a&gt; to qualified researchers, among whom was the noted historian of the Papacy &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20von%20Pastor\"&gt;Ludwig von Pastor&lt;/a&gt;. He also refounded the &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20Observatory\"&gt;Vatican Observatory&lt;/a&gt;\n\"so that everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but that they embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion.\"\nLeo XIII was the first Pope of whose voice a &lt;a href=\"sound%20recording\"&gt;sound recording&lt;/a&gt; was made. The recording can be found on a compact disc of &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Moreschi\"&gt;Alessandro Moreschi&lt;/a&gt;'s singing; a recording of his praying of the &lt;a href=\"Ave%20Maria%20%28musical%20settings%29\"&gt;Ave Maria&lt;/a&gt; is available on the Web. He was also the first Pope to be filmed by a motion picture camera. He was filmed by its inventor, &lt;a href=\"W.%20K.%20Dickson\"&gt;W. K. Dickson&lt;/a&gt;, and blessed the camera while being filmed.\nLeo XIII brought normality back to the Church after the tumultuous years of Pius IX. Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anticlerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse that trend.\nAlthough Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy moved the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.\nPope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the &lt;a href=\"fifth%20cholera%20pandemic\"&gt;fifth cholera pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in 1891, he ordered the construction of a &lt;a href=\"hospice\"&gt;hospice&lt;/a&gt; inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the &lt;a href=\"Domus%20Sanctae%20Marthae\"&gt;Domus Sanctae Marthae&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeo was a drinker of the &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;-infused wine tonic &lt;a href=\"Vin%20Mariani\"&gt;Vin Mariani&lt;/a&gt;. He awarded a &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20City\"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; gold medal to the wine's creator, &lt;a href=\"Angelo%20Mariani%20%28chemist%29\"&gt;Angelo Mariani&lt;/a&gt;, and also appeared on a poster endorsing it. Leo XIII was a &lt;a href=\"semi-vegetarianism\"&gt;semi-vegetarian&lt;/a&gt;. In 1903, he attributed his longevity to the sparing use of meat and the consumption of eggs, milk and vegetables.\nHis favourite poets were &lt;a href=\"Virgil\"&gt;Virgil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dante%20Alighieri\"&gt;Dante&lt;/a&gt;.\nForeign relations.\nRussia.\nPope Leo XIII began his pontificate with a friendly letter to Tsar &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Alexander II&lt;/a&gt; in which he reminded the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; monarch of the millions of Catholics living in his empire who would like to be good Russian subjects if their dignity were respected.\nAfter the assassination of Alexander II, the Pope sent a high ranking representative to the coronation of his successor, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Alexander III&lt;/a&gt;, who was grateful and asked for all religious forces to unify. He asked the Pope to ensure that his bishops abstain from political &lt;a href=\"agitator\"&gt;agitation&lt;/a&gt;. Relations improved further when Pope Leo XIII, because of Italian considerations, distanced the Vatican from the Rome-Vienna-Berlin alliance, and helped to facilitate a rapprochement between Paris and St. Petersburg.\nGermany.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Otto%20von%20Bismarck\"&gt;Otto von Bismarck&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"anti-Catholic\"&gt;anti-Catholic&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Kulturkampf\"&gt;Kulturkampf&lt;/a&gt;\" in Prussia led to significant restrictions on the Catholic Church in Imperial Germany, including the &lt;a href=\"Jesuits%20Law%20%281872%29\"&gt;Jesuits Law of 1872&lt;/a&gt;. During Leo's papacy, compromises were informally reached and the anti-Catholic attacks subsided.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Centre%20Party%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;Centre Party&lt;/a&gt; in Germany represented Catholic interests and was a force for social change. It was encouraged by Leo's support for social welfare legislation and the rights of working people. Leo's forward-looking approach encouraged Catholic Action in other European countries, where the social teachings of the Church were incorporated into the agenda of Catholic parties, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20democracy\"&gt;Christian democratic&lt;/a&gt; parties, which became an acceptable alternative to socialist parties. Leo's social teachings were reiterated throughout the 20th century by his successors.\nIn his \"Memoirs\", &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor\"&gt;Kaiser Wilhelm II&lt;/a&gt; discussed the \"friendly, trustful relationship that existed between me and Pope Leo XIII.\" During Wilhelm's third visit to Leo: \"It was of interest to me that the Pope said on this occasion that Germany must be the sword of the Catholic Church. I remarked that the old Roman Empire of the German nation no longer existed, and that conditions had changed. But he adhered to his words.\"\nFrance.\nLeo XIII possessed a great affection for France, and feared that the &lt;a href=\"Third%20French%20Republic\"&gt;Third Republic&lt;/a&gt; would take advantage of the fact that most French Catholics were &lt;a href=\"Royalists\"&gt;Royalists&lt;/a&gt; to abolish the &lt;a href=\"Concordant%20of%201801\"&gt;Concordant of 1801&lt;/a&gt;. At the advisement of &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Rampolla\"&gt;Cardinal Rampolla&lt;/a&gt;, he urged French Catholics to \"rally\" to the republic. Leo's decision upset many French monarchists, who felt they were being forced to betray their king for their faith. Ultimately, this move split the French Church politically and decreased its influence in France. Leo's move also failed to prevent the Concordant's eventual repealment, as it was later abrogated by the &lt;a href=\"1905%20French%20law%20on%20the%20Separation%20of%20the%20Churches%20and%20the%20State\"&gt;law of 1905&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"separation%20of%20Church%20and%20state\"&gt;separation of Church and state&lt;/a&gt;.\nItaly.\nIn the light of a climate hostile to the Church, Leo continued the policies of Pius IX towards Italy without major modifications. In his relations with the Italian state, Leo continued the Papacy's self-imposed &lt;a href=\"prisoner%20in%20the%20Vatican\"&gt;incarceration in the Vatican&lt;/a&gt; stance and continued to insist that Italian Catholics should not vote in Italian elections or hold any elected office. In his first &lt;a href=\"papal%20consistory\"&gt;consistory&lt;/a&gt; in 1879, he elevated his older brother, &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Pecci\"&gt;Giuseppe&lt;/a&gt;, to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the &lt;a href=\"Tiber\"&gt;Tiber&lt;/a&gt; on 13 July 1881. The Pope even considered moving his residence to &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Salzburg\"&gt;Salzburg&lt;/a&gt;, two cities in &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, an idea that Emperor &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Joseph%20I%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Franz Joseph I&lt;/a&gt; gently rejected.\nUnited Kingdom.\nAmong the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20of%20the%20Scottish%20hierarchy\"&gt;restored the Scottish hierarchy&lt;/a&gt; in 1878. The following year, on 12 May 1879, he raised to the rank of &lt;a href=\"cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29\"&gt;cardinal&lt;/a&gt; the convert clergyman &lt;a href=\"John%20Henry%20Newman\"&gt;John Henry Newman&lt;/a&gt;, who would eventually be &lt;a href=\"beatification\"&gt;beatified&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 and &lt;a href=\"canonization\"&gt;canonized&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Francis\"&gt;Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. In &lt;a href=\"British%20India\"&gt;British India&lt;/a&gt;, too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886 and regulated some longstanding conflicts with the Portuguese authorities. A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish &lt;a href=\"Plan%20of%20Campaign%23Papal%20Encyclical%201888\"&gt;Plan of Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the papal encyclical \"Saepe Nos\" that was addressed to all the Irish bishops. Of outstanding significance, not least for the English-speaking world, was Leo's encyclical \"&lt;a href=\"Apostolicae%20curae\"&gt;Apostolicae curae&lt;/a&gt;\" on the invalidity of the Anglican orders, published in 1896. In 1899, he declared St &lt;a href=\"Bede\"&gt;Bede&lt;/a&gt; the Venerable a &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20the%20Church\"&gt;Doctor of the Church&lt;/a&gt;.\nBulgaria.\nLeo XIII welcomed the elevation of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg to the Bulgarian Principality in 1886. A fellow Catholic, whose wife was a member the Italian house of Bourbon-Parma, the two had a lot in common. However, relations between the two greatly soured when Ferdinand expressed his intention to convert his eldest son Crown Prince Boris (later &lt;a href=\"Tsar%20Boris%20III\"&gt;Tsar Boris III&lt;/a&gt;) to Orthodoxy, the majority religion of Bulgaria. Leo strongly condemned the action, and when Ferdinand went through with the conversion anyway, Leo excommunicated him.\nUnited States.\nThe United States frequently attracted his attention and admiration. He confirmed the decrees of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Plenary%20Council%20of%20Baltimore\"&gt;Third Plenary Council of Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; (1884) and raised &lt;a href=\"James%20Gibbons\"&gt;James Gibbons&lt;/a&gt;, the archbishop of that city, to the cardinalate in 1886.\nOn 10 April 1887, a pontifical charter from Pope Leo XIII founded the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20University%20of%20America\"&gt;Catholic University of America&lt;/a&gt;, establishing the national university of the Catholic Church in the United States.\nAmerican newspapers criticized Pope Leo because they claimed that he was attempting to gain control of American public schools. One cartoonist drew Leo as a fox unable to reach grapes that were labeled for American schools; the caption read \"Sour grapes!\"\nBrazil.\nPope Leo XIII is also remembered for the \"First Plenary Council of Latin America\" held at Rome in 1899, and for his encyclical of 1888 to the bishops of &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"In%20plurimis\"&gt;In plurimis&lt;/a&gt;\", on the &lt;a href=\"slavery%20in%20Brazil\"&gt;abolition of slavery&lt;/a&gt;. In 1897 he published the &lt;a href=\"Apostolic%20Letter\"&gt;Apostolic Letter&lt;/a&gt; \"Trans Oceanum\", which dealt with the privileges and ecclesiastical structure of the Catholic Church in Latin America.\nChile.\nHis role in South America will also be remembered, especially the pontifical benediction extended over &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;an troops on the eve of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Chorrillos\"&gt;Battle of Chorrillos&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Pacific\"&gt;War of the Pacific&lt;/a&gt; in January 1881. The Chilean soldiers thus blessed then looted the cities of &lt;a href=\"Chorrillos%20District\"&gt;Chorrillos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barranco%20District\"&gt;Barranco&lt;/a&gt;, including the churches, and their Chaplains headed the robbery at the &lt;a href=\"National%20Library%20of%20Peru\"&gt;Biblioteca Nacional del Per\u00fa&lt;/a&gt;, where the soldiers ransacked various items along with much capital, and Chilean Priests coveted rare and ancient editions of the Bible that were stored there. Despite this, one year later Chilean President Domingo Santa Mar\u00eca issued the \"Laic Laws\", which separated the Church from the State, considered a slap in the face for the papacy.\nIndia.\nPope Leo XIII urged \"Filii tui India, administri tibi salutis\" (Your own sons, O India, will be the heralds of your salvation) and founded the national seminary, called &lt;a href=\"Papal%20Seminary\"&gt;Papal Seminary&lt;/a&gt;. He entrusted this task to the then Apostolic Delegate to India &lt;a href=\"Ladislaus%20Michael%20Zaleski\"&gt;Ladislaus Michael Zaleski&lt;/a&gt;, who founded the Seminary in 1893.\nEvangelization.\nPope Leo XIII sanctioned the missions to &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Africa\"&gt;Eastern Africa&lt;/a&gt; beginning in 1884. In 1879 Catholic missionaries associated with the &lt;a href=\"White%20Fathers\"&gt;White Father Congregation (Society of the Missionaries of Africa)&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Uganda\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; and others went to Tanganyika (present-day &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Rwanda\"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1887, he approved the foundation of &lt;a href=\"Missionaries%20of%20St.%20Charles%20Borromeo\"&gt;Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo&lt;/a&gt;, which were organized by the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Piacenza\"&gt;Bishop of Piacenza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Battista%20Scalabrini\"&gt;Giovanni Battista Scalabrini&lt;/a&gt;. The missionaries were sent to North and South America to do pastoral care for Italian immigrants.\nTheology.\nThe pontificate of Leo XIII was theologically influenced by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Vatican%20Council\"&gt;First Vatican Council&lt;/a&gt; (1869\u20131870), which had ended only eight years earlier. Leo XIII issued some 46 &lt;a href=\"apostolic%20letter\"&gt;apostolic letter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"encyclical\"&gt;encyclical&lt;/a&gt;s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the &lt;a href=\"intercession\"&gt;intercession&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Michael%20%28archangel%29\"&gt;Michael the Archangel&lt;/a&gt; after he allegedly had a vision of Michael and the &lt;a href=\"end%20time\"&gt;end time&lt;/a&gt;s, but the story of the alleged vision may be merely &lt;a href=\"apocryphal\"&gt;apocryphal&lt;/a&gt;, as historians note that the story does not appear in any of his writings.\nLeo XIII also approved a number of Scapulars. In 1885, he approved the &lt;a href=\"Scapular%20of%20the%20Holy%20Face\"&gt;Scapular of the Holy Face&lt;/a&gt;, (also known as \"The Veronica\") and elevated the \"Priests of the Holy Face\" to an archconfraternity. He also approved the Scapular of &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%20of%20Good%20Counsel\"&gt;Our Lady of Good Counsel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scapular%20of%20St.%20Joseph\"&gt;Scapular of St. Joseph&lt;/a&gt;, both in 1893, and the &lt;a href=\"Scapular%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Heart\"&gt;Scapular of the Sacred Heart&lt;/a&gt; in 1900.\nThomism.\nAs pope, he used all his authority for a revival of &lt;a href=\"Thomism\"&gt;Thomism&lt;/a&gt;, the theology of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Aquinas\"&gt;Thomas Aquinas&lt;/a&gt;. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical \"&lt;a href=\"Aeterni%20Patris\"&gt;Aeterni Patris&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Eternal Father\"), which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism, the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas \u2013 as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.\nPope Leo XIII then created the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Academy%20of%20St.%20Thomas%20Aquinas\"&gt;Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas&lt;/a&gt; on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called &lt;a href=\"Leonine%20Edition\"&gt;Leonine Edition&lt;/a&gt;, of the complete works of the \"doctor angelicus\". The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to &lt;a href=\"Tommaso%20Maria%20Zigliara\"&gt;Tommaso Maria Zigliara&lt;/a&gt;, professor and rector of the \"Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe,\" the future &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20University%20of%20Saint%20Thomas%20Aquinas\"&gt;Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\"&lt;/a&gt;. Leo XIII also founded the \"Angelicum's\" Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of &lt;a href=\"Canon%20law%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;Canon Law&lt;/a&gt; in 1896.\nConsecrations.\nPope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he had received many letters from &lt;a href=\"Mary%20of%20the%20Divine%20Heart\"&gt;Sister Mary of the Divine Heart&lt;/a&gt;, the countess of &lt;a href=\"Droste%20zu%20Vischering\"&gt;Droste zu Vischering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wikt%3ASpecial%3ASearch/mother%20superior\"&gt;Mother Superior&lt;/a&gt; in the Convent of the &lt;a href=\"Congregation%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20Charity%20of%20the%20Good%20Shepherd\"&gt;Good Shepherd Sisters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Porto\"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt;, Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive and so in the encyclical letter \"&lt;a href=\"Annum%20sacrum\"&gt;Annum sacrum&lt;/a&gt;\" (on 25 May 1899), he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.\nThe encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the &lt;a href=\"First%20Friday%20Devotions\"&gt;First Friday Devotions&lt;/a&gt;, established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Consecration%20to%20the%20Sacred%20Heart\"&gt;Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart&lt;/a&gt;. His consecration of the entire world to the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Heart%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Sacred Heart of Jesus&lt;/a&gt; presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and countries had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, the consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.\nScriptures.\nIn his 1893 encyclical \"&lt;a href=\"Providentissimus%20Deus\"&gt;Providentissimus Deus&lt;/a&gt;,\" he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out 50 years later in his encyclical \"Divino Afflante Spiritu\".\nRelations with Eastern Orthodox Churches.\nPope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Catholic%20Churches\"&gt;Eastern Rite&lt;/a&gt; Churches and stated that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed that in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894 and wrote, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"\nTheological research.\nLeo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20Archive\"&gt;Vatican Archive&lt;/a&gt;s and personally fostered a 20-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20von%20Pastor\"&gt;Ludwig von Pastor&lt;/a&gt;, an Austrian historian.\nMariology.\nHis predecessor, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20IX\"&gt;Pope Pius IX&lt;/a&gt;, became known as the Pope of the &lt;a href=\"Immaculate%20Conception\"&gt;Immaculate Conception&lt;/a&gt; because of his dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the &lt;a href=\"rosary\"&gt;rosary&lt;/a&gt; in 11 encyclicals, was called the &lt;a href=\"Rosary%20Pope\"&gt;Rosary Pope&lt;/a&gt; because he promulgated Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the 50th anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses Mary's role in the redemption of humanity and calls her &lt;a href=\"Mediatrix\"&gt;Mediatrix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Co-Redemptrix\"&gt;Co-Redemptrix&lt;/a&gt;. While allowing the title \"Mediatrix\", recent popes, following on the Second Vatican Council, have warned away from the term \"co-redemptrix\" as derogating from the one mediator, Jesus Christ.\nSocial teachings.\nChurch and state.\nLeo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, but he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man.\" Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.\n\"Rerum novarum\".\nHis encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities; the 1891 encyclical \"&lt;a href=\"Rerum%20novarum\"&gt;Rerum novarum&lt;/a&gt;\", for the first time, addressed social inequality and social justice issues with papal authority by focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Emmanuel%20von%20Ketteler\"&gt;Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler&lt;/a&gt;, a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book \"Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum\". Since Leo XIII, papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20XI\"&gt;Pope Pius XI&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Quadragesimo%20anno\"&gt;Quadragesimo anno&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"social%20teachings%20of%20Pope%20Pius%20XII\"&gt;social teachings of Pope Pius XII&lt;/a&gt; on a huge range of social issues, &lt;a href=\"John%20XXIII\"&gt;John XXIII&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Mater%20et%20magistra\"&gt;Mater et magistra&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1961, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Paul%20VI\"&gt;Pope Paul VI&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Populorum%20progressio\"&gt;Populorum progressio&lt;/a&gt;\" on world development issues, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Centesimus%20annus\"&gt;Centesimus annus&lt;/a&gt;\", commemorating the 100th anniversary of \"Rerum novarum,\" and &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Francis\"&gt;Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"Laudato%20si%27\"&gt;Laudato si'&lt;/a&gt;\" on the use of the goods of creation.\nLeo had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. \"Rerum novarum\" introduced the idea of &lt;a href=\"subsidiarity%20%28Catholicism%29\"&gt;subsidiarity&lt;/a&gt;, the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought. (See &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20Encyclicals%20of%20Pope%20Leo%20XIII\"&gt;list of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII&lt;/a&gt;.)\nCanonizations and beatifications.\nLeo XIII canonized the following saints during his pontificate:\nLeo XIII beatified several of his predecessors: &lt;a href=\"Urban%20II\"&gt;Urban II&lt;/a&gt; (14 July 1881), &lt;a href=\"Victor%20III\"&gt;Victor III&lt;/a&gt; (23 July 1887) and &lt;a href=\"Innocent%20V\"&gt;Innocent V&lt;/a&gt; (9 March 1898). He canonized &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20III\"&gt;Adrian III&lt;/a&gt; on 2 June 1891.\nHe also beatified the following:\nHe approved the cult of &lt;a href=\"Cosmas%20of%20Aphrodisia\"&gt;Cosmas of Aphrodisia&lt;/a&gt;. He beatified several of the English martyrs in 1895.\nDoctors of the Church.\nLeo XIII named four individuals as &lt;a href=\"Doctors%20of%20the%20Church\"&gt;Doctors of the Church&lt;/a&gt;:\nAudiences.\nOne of the first audiences that Leo XIII granted was to the professors and students of the &lt;a href=\"Collegio%20Capranica\"&gt;Collegio Capranica&lt;/a&gt;, where in the first row knelt in front of him the young seminarian Giacomo Della Chiesa, the future &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XV\"&gt;Pope Benedict XV&lt;/a&gt;, who would reign from 1914 to 1922.\nOn a pilgrimage with her father and sister in 1887, the future &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se%20of%20Lisieux\"&gt;Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux&lt;/a&gt; attended a general audience with Pope Leo XIII and asked him to allow her to enter the &lt;a href=\"Carmelite%20order\"&gt;Carmelite order&lt;/a&gt;. Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told that it would prolong the audience too much, she wrote in her autobiography, \"Story of a Soul\", that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you. In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\" Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... \"You will enter if God wills it\"\" [italics hers]. Two guards lifted her (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door, where a third gave her a medal of the Pope. Shortly thereafter, the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Bayeux\"&gt;Bishop of Bayeux&lt;/a&gt; authorized the prioress to receive Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and in April 1888, she entered Carmel at the age of 15.\nDeath.\nLeo XIII was the first pope to be born in the 19th century and was also the first to die in the 20th century: he lived to the age of 93, dying on 20 July 1903, the second-longest-lived pope ever behind &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; (). At the time of his death, Leo XIII was the second-longest-reigning pope (25 years), exceeded only by his immediate predecessor, &lt;a href=\"Pius%20IX\"&gt;Pius IX&lt;/a&gt; (31 years).\nHe was entombed in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Peter%27s%20Basilica\"&gt;Saint Peter's Basilica&lt;/a&gt; only very briefly after his funeral; he was later moved to the &lt;a href=\"Basilica%20of%20Saint%20John%20Lateran\"&gt;Basilica of Saint John Lateran&lt;/a&gt;, his cathedral church as the Bishop of Rome, and a church in which he took a particular interest. He was moved there in late 1924."
