The figure forms one of the traces for the presence of &lt;a href=\"Dualism%20in%20cosmology\"&gt;dualist proclivities&lt;/a&gt; in the otherwise monotheistic visions of both the &lt;a href=\"Tanakh\"&gt;Tanakh&lt;/a&gt; and later Christian doctrine. The name Metatron is not mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Torah\"&gt;Torah&lt;/a&gt; nor the Bible and how the name originated is a matter of debate. In &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic tradition, he is also known as M\u012b\u1e6da\u1e6dr\u016bn (), the angel of the veil. In folkloristic tradition, he is the highest of the &lt;a href=\"angels\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt; and serves as the celestial scribe or \"recording angel\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20apocrypha\"&gt;Jewish apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; and early Kabbalah, \"Metatron\" is the name that &lt;a href=\"Enoch%20%28ancestor%20of%20Noah%29\"&gt;Enoch&lt;/a&gt; received after his transformation into an &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nNumerous etymologies have been proposed to account for the name Metatron, but there is no consensus, and its precise origin is unknown. Some scholars, such as Philip Alexander, believe that if the name Metatron originated in Hekhalot-Merkabah texts (such as &lt;a href=\"3%20Enoch\"&gt;3 Enoch&lt;/a&gt;), then it may have been a magic word like \"Adiriron\" and \"Dapdapiron\".\nHugo Odeberg, &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Jellinek\"&gt;Adolf Jellinek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Jastrow\"&gt;Marcus Jastrow&lt;/a&gt; suggested the name may have originated from either Mattara (\u05de\u05d8\u05e8\u05d0) \"keeper of the watch\" or the verb Memater (\u05de\u05de\u05d8\u05e8) \"to guard\" or \"to protect\". An early derivation of this can be seen in \"Shimmusha Rabbah\", where Enoch is clothed in light and is the guardian of the souls ascending to heaven. Odeberg also suggested that the name Metatron might have been adopted from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Persian\"&gt;Old Persian&lt;/a&gt; name &lt;a href=\"Mithra\"&gt;Mithra&lt;/a&gt;. Citing Wiesner, he drew up a number of parallels that appeared to link Mithra and Metatron based on their positions in heaven and duties.\nAnother hypothesis would derive Metatron from a combination of two Greek words, meaning \"after\" and \"throne\", which, taken together, would suggest the idea of \"one who serves behind the throne\" or \"one who occupies the throne next to the throne of glory\". The primary arguments against this etymology are that Metatron's function as a servant of the celestial throne emerges only later in the traditions regarding him, and \u03b8\u03c1\u00f3\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 itself is not attested as a word in Talmudic literature. \nA connection with the word (\"synthronos\") used as \"co-occupant of the divine throne\", has been advanced by some scholars; This, like the above etymology, is not found in any source materials. It is supported by Saul Lieberman and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Sch%C3%A4fer\"&gt;Peter Sch\u00e4fer&lt;/a&gt;, who give further reasons why this might be a viable etymology. The Latin word \"Metator\" (messenger, guide, leader, measurer) had been suggested by &lt;a href=\"Eleazar%20of%20Worms\"&gt;Eleazar of Worms&lt;/a&gt; (c. 1165 \u2013 c. 1230), &lt;a href=\"Nachmanides\"&gt;Nachmanides&lt;/a&gt;, and brought to light again by Hugo Odeberg. When transliterated into the Hebrew language, we get \u05de\u05d8\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8 or \u05de\u05d9\u05d8\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8. Gershom Scholem argues that there is no data to justify the conversion of \"metator\" to \"metatron\". Philip Alexander also suggests this as a possible origin of Metatron, stating that the word \"Metator\" also occurs in Greek as \"mitator\"\u2013a word for an officer in the Roman army who acted as a forerunner. Using this etymology, Alexander suggests the name may have come about as a description of \"the angel of the Lord who led the Israelites through the wilderness: acting like a Roman army metator guiding the Israelites on their way\". Another possible interpretation is that of Enoch as a metator showing them \"how they could escape from the wilderness of this world into the promised land of heaven\". Because we see this as a word in Hebrew, Jewish Aramaic, and Greek, Alexander believes this gives even more strength to this etymology.\nOther ideas include (\"metron\", \"a measure\"). Charles Mopsik believes that the name Metatron may be related to the sentence from Genesis 5:24 \"Enoch walked with God, then he was no more, because God took him.\" The Greek version of the Hebrew word \"to take\" is (he was transferred). (RON) is a standard addition to (Metatron) and other angelic names in the Jewish faith. According to Mopsik, (MTT) is a transliteration from the Greek .\nIn the entry entitled \"Paradigmata\" in his study, \"'The Written' as the Vocation of Conceiving Jewishly\", John W McGinley gives an accounting of how this name functions in the Bavli's version of \"four entered pardes\". This account maintains that \"Ishmael ben Elisha\" is a rabbinically sanctioned cognomen for &lt;a href=\"Elisha%20ben%20Abuyah\"&gt;Elisha ben Abuyah&lt;/a&gt; (the \"Akher\" of the &lt;a href=\"Babylonian%20Talmud\"&gt;Bavli&lt;/a&gt;'s account). This hypothesis explains why the generators of the \"chambers\" portion of the \"Heikhalot\" literature make \"Ishmael ben Elisha\" the major protagonist of their writings even though this Rabbi Ishmael was not directly mentioned in the Bavli's account (in the Gemara to tractate \"Khaggigah\") of \"The Work of the Chariot\".\n&lt;a href=\"Solomon%20Judah%20Loeb%20Rapoport\"&gt;Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport&lt;/a&gt; in \"Igrot Shi\"r\" suggests that Metatron is a combination of two Greek words which mean to \"change\" and \"pass away\" referring to \"Chanoch\" (Enoch) who \"changed\" into an angel and \"passed away\" from the world.\nOrigins.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Hellenistic%20period\"&gt;Hellenistic times&lt;/a&gt;, mention of a second divine figure, either beside &lt;a href=\"Tetragrammaton\"&gt;YHWH&lt;/a&gt; or beneath him, occur in a number of Jewish texts, mostly apocryphal. These Jewish traditions implying a divine dualism were most frequently associated with Enoch. In the rabbinic period they centre on 'Metatron', often in the context of debates over the heretical doctrine of 'two powers in heaven' (\"shtei rashuyot ba-shamayim\"). Ultimately these ideas appear to go back to differing interpretations of the heavenly enthronement passages at &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Exodus\"&gt;Exodus 24:10f.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Daniel\"&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt; 7:9f. and perhaps even Ezekiel 1:26f. These different interpretations later came to distinguish what was orthodox from what was heretical in Judaism.\nAmong the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Old%20Testament%20pseudepigrapha\"&gt;pseudepigrapha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Enoch%23Book%20of%20Parables\"&gt;1 Enoch: Book of Parables&lt;/a&gt; presents two figures: the &lt;a href=\"son%20of%20man\"&gt;son of man&lt;/a&gt; and Enoch. At first, these two characters seem to be separate entities. Enoch views the son of man enthroned in Heaven. Later, however, they prove to be one and the same. Many scholars believe that the final chapters in the Book of Parables are a later addition. Others think they are not and that the son of man is Enoch's heavenly double similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Joseph\"&gt;Prayer of Joseph&lt;/a&gt; where Jacob is depicted as an angel. The Book of Daniel displays two similar characters: the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20Days\"&gt;Ancient of Days&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"son%20of%20man%20%28Judaism%29%23Daniel\"&gt;one like a man&lt;/a&gt;. Parts of the text in Daniel are &lt;a href=\"Aramaic\"&gt;Aramaic&lt;/a&gt; and may have been changed in translation. The &lt;a href=\"Septuagint\"&gt;Septuagint&lt;/a&gt; reads that the son of man came as the Ancient of Days. All other translations say the son of man gained access to the Ancient of Days and was brought before that one.\nThe identification of Metatron with the gnostic \"3\u00a0Enoch\", where the name first appears, is not explicitly made in the Talmud although it does refer to a Prince of the World who was young but now is old. However, some of the earliest &lt;a href=\"kabbalah\"&gt;kabbalists&lt;/a&gt; assumed the connection. There also seems to be two Metatrons, one spelled with six letters (\u05de\u05d8\u05d8\u05e8\u05d5\u05df), and one spelled with seven (\u05de\u05d9\u05d8\u05d8\u05e8\u05d5\u05df). The former may be the transformed Enoch, Prince of the Countenance within the &lt;a href=\"Hekhalot%20literature\"&gt;divine palace&lt;/a&gt;; the latter, the Primordial Metatron, an &lt;a href=\"Sefirot\"&gt;emanation&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Cause of Causes\", specifically the tenth and last &lt;a href=\"Sefirot\"&gt;emanation&lt;/a&gt;, identified with the earthly &lt;a href=\"Shekhinah\"&gt;Divine Presence&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the &lt;a href=\"Merkabah%20mysticism\"&gt;Merkabah&lt;/a&gt; text Re' uyot Yehezkel identifies the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20Days\"&gt;Ancient of Days&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Daniel\"&gt;Book of Daniel&lt;/a&gt; as Metatron.\nScholem's scholastic analysis.\nMany scholars see a discontinuity between how Enoch is portrayed in the early Enoch literature and how Metatron is portrayed. Scholars commonly see the character of Metatron as being based on an amalgam of Jewish literature, in addition to Enoch, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20%28archangel%29\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Melchizedek\"&gt;Melchizedek&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jehoel\"&gt;Yahoel&lt;/a&gt; among others are seen as influences.\nGershom Scholem argues Metatron's character was influenced by two streams of thought. One of which linked Metatron with Enoch, while the second was a fusing of different obscure entities and mythic motifs. Scholem argues that this second tradition was originally separate but later became fused with the Enoch tradition. He points to texts where this second Metatron is a primordial angel and referred to as Metatron Rabbah. Scholem theorizes that the two Hebrew spellings of Metatron's name are representative of these two separate traditions. In his view the second Metatron is linked to Yahoel. Scholem also links Yahoel with Michael. In the &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20of%20Abraham\"&gt;Apocalypse of Abraham&lt;/a&gt; Yahoel is assigned duties normally reserved for Michael. Yahoel's name is commonly seen as a substitute for the Ineffable Name.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Second%20Book%20of%20Enoch\"&gt;\"2\u00a0Enoch\"&lt;/a&gt;, Enoch is assigned titles commonly used by Metatron such as \"the Youth, the Prince of the Presence and the Prince of the World.\" However we do not see Enoch referred to as the Lesser YHWH. In \"3\u00a0Enoch\", Metatron is called the Lesser YHWH. This raises a problem since the name Metatron does not seem to be directly related to the name of God YHWH. Scholem proposes that this is because the Lesser YHWH is a reference to Yahoel. In &lt;a href=\"Maaseh%20Merkabah\"&gt;Maaseh Merkabah&lt;/a&gt; the text reasons that Metatron is called the Lesser YHWH because in Hebrew gematria Metatron is numerically equivalent to another name of God \"Shaddai\". Scholem does not find this convincing. Scholem points to the fact that both Yahoel and Metatron were known as the Lesser YHWH. In \"3\u00a0Enoch\" 48D1 Metatron is called both Yahoel Yah and Yahoel. In addition to being one of the seventy names of Metatron from \"3\u00a0Enoch\" 48D, Yahoel and Metatron are also linked in Aramaic incantation bowl inscriptions.\nTalmud.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Babylonian%20Talmud\"&gt;Babylonian Talmud&lt;/a&gt; mentions Metatron by name in three places: Hagigah 15a, Sanhedrin 38b and Avodah Zarah 3b.\nHagigah 15a describes &lt;a href=\"Elisha%20ben%20Abuyah\"&gt;Elisha ben Abuyah&lt;/a&gt; in Paradise seeing Metatron sitting down (an action that is not done in the presence of God). Elishah ben Abuyah therefore looks to Metatron as a deity and says heretically: \"There are indeed two powers in Heaven!\" The rabbis explain that Metatron had permission to sit because of his function as the Heavenly Scribe, writing down the deeds of Israel. The Talmud states, it was proved to Elisha that Metatron could not be a second deity by the fact that Metatron received 60 \"&lt;a href=\"Pulsa%20diNura\"&gt;strokes with fiery rods&lt;/a&gt;\" to demonstrate that Metatron was not a god, but an angel, and could be punished.\nIn Sanhedrin 38b one of the &lt;a href=\"Heresy%20in%20Judaism\"&gt;minim&lt;/a&gt; tells Rabbi Idith that Metatron should be worshiped because he has a name like his master. Rabbi Idith uses the same passage Exodus 23:21 to show that Metatron was an angel and not a deity and thus should not be worshiped. Furthermore, as an angel Metatron has no power to pardon transgressions nor was he to be received even as a messenger of forgiveness.\nIn Avodah Zarah 3b, the Talmud hypothesizes as to how God spends His day. It is suggested that in the fourth quarter of the day God sits and instructs the school children, while in the preceding three quarters Metatron may take God's place or God may do this among other tasks.\nYevamot 16b records an utterance, \"I have been young; also I have been old\" found in Psalm 37:25. The Talmud here attributes this utterance to the Chief Angel and Prince of the World, whom the rabbinic tradition identifies as Metatron.\nKirkisani.\nThe tenth century &lt;a href=\"Karaite%20Judaism\"&gt;Karaite&lt;/a&gt; scholar &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20Qirqisani\"&gt;Jacob Qirqisani&lt;/a&gt; believed that rabbinic Judaism was the heresy of &lt;a href=\"Jeroboam\"&gt;Jeroboam&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29\"&gt;the Kingdom of Israel&lt;/a&gt;. He quoted a version of Sanhedrin 38b, which he claimed contained a reference to the \"lesser YHVH.\" &lt;a href=\"Gershom%20Scholem\"&gt;Gershom Scholem&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the name was deliberately omitted from later copies of the Talmud. However, Qirqisani may have misrepresented the Talmud in order to embarrass his Rabbanite opponents with evidence of &lt;a href=\"polytheism\"&gt;polytheism&lt;/a&gt;. Extra-talmudic mystical texts such as Sefer Hekhalot do speak of a \"lesser YHWH\", apparently deriving the concept from Exodus 23:21, which mentions an angel of whom God says \"my name [understood as YHVH, the usual divine Proper Name] is in him\".\nMerkabah, Zohar and other mystical writings.\nMetatron also appears in the &lt;a href=\"Pseudepigrapha\"&gt;Pseudepigrapha&lt;/a&gt; including \"&lt;a href=\"Shi%27ur%20Qomah\"&gt;Shi'ur Qomah&lt;/a&gt;\", and most prominently in the Hebrew &lt;a href=\"Merkabah\"&gt;Merkabah&lt;/a&gt; Book of Enoch, also called &lt;a href=\"3%20Enoch\"&gt;3 Enoch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sefer%20Hekhalot\"&gt;Sefer Hekhalot&lt;/a&gt; (Book of [the Heavenly] Palaces). The book describes the link between &lt;a href=\"Enoch%20%28ancestor%20of%20Noah%29\"&gt;Enoch&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Jared%20%28biblical%20figure%29\"&gt;Jared&lt;/a&gt; (great grandfather of &lt;a href=\"Noah\"&gt;Noah&lt;/a&gt;) and his transformation into the angel Metatron. His grand title \"the lesser &lt;a href=\"YHVH\"&gt;YHVH&lt;/a&gt;\" resurfaces here. The word \"Metatron\" is numerically equivalent to &lt;a href=\"El%20Shaddai\"&gt;Shaddai&lt;/a&gt; (God) in Hebrew &lt;a href=\"gematria\"&gt;gematria&lt;/a&gt;; therefore, he is said to have a \"Name like his Master\".\nMetatron says, \"He [the Holy One]... called me, 'The lesser YHVH' in the presence of his whole household in the height, as it is written, 'my name is in him.'\" (12:5, Alexander's translation.) The narrator of this book, supposedly &lt;a href=\"Rabbi%20Ishmael\"&gt;Rabbi Ishmael&lt;/a&gt;, tells how Metatron guided him through Heaven and explained its wonders. 3 Enoch presents Metatron in two ways: as a primordial angel (9:2\u201313:2) and as the transformation of Enoch after he was assumed into Heaven.\nMetatron \"the Youth\", a title previously used in 3 Enoch, where it appears to mean \"servant\". It identifies him as the angel that led the people of &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; through the wilderness after their exodus from &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; (again referring to Exodus 23:21, see above), and describes him as a heavenly priest.\nIn the later Ecstatic Kabbalah, Metatron is a messianic figure.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zohar\"&gt;Zohar&lt;/a&gt; describes Metatron as the \"King of the angels.\" and associates the concept of Metatron with that of the divine name Shadday. Zohar commentaries such as the \"Ohr Yakar\" by &lt;a href=\"Moses%20ben%20Jacob%20Cordovero\"&gt;Moses ben Jacob Cordovero&lt;/a&gt; explain the Zohar as meaning that Metatron as the head of &lt;a href=\"Yetzirah\"&gt;Yetzira&lt;/a&gt; This corresponds closely with &lt;a href=\"Maimonides\"&gt;Maimonides&lt;/a&gt;' description of the Talmudic \"Prince of the World\", traditionally associated with Metatron, as the core \"&lt;a href=\"Active%20intellect\"&gt;Active Intellect&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zohar\"&gt;Zohar&lt;/a&gt; describes several biblical figures as metaphors for Metatron. Examples are Enoch, Joseph, Eliezer, Joshua, and others. The Zohar finds the word \"youth\" used to describe Joseph and Joshua a hint that the figures are a metaphor to Metatron, and also the concept of \"servant\" by Eliezer as a reference to Metatron. The &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Moses\"&gt;Staff of Moses&lt;/a&gt; is also described by the Zohar as a reference to Metatron. The Zohar also states that the two &lt;a href=\"Tet%20%28letter%29\"&gt;tets&lt;/a&gt; in \"totaphot\" of the &lt;a href=\"Tefillin\"&gt;phylacteries&lt;/a&gt; are a reference to Metatron. The Zohar draws distinction between Metatron and Michael. While &lt;a href=\"Michael%20%28archangel%29\"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; is described repeatedly in the Zohar as the figure represented by the &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20of%20Israel\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt;, Metatron is represented by the structure of the &lt;a href=\"tabernacle\"&gt;tabernacle&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nApocalyptic texts.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse%20of%20Zerubbabel\"&gt;Apocalypse of Zerubbabel&lt;/a&gt; Metatron is not identified as Enoch. Instead he is identified as the &lt;a href=\"Michael%20%28archangel%29\"&gt;archangel Michael&lt;/a&gt;. The text also records that Metatron in &lt;a href=\"gematria\"&gt;gematria&lt;/a&gt; is the equivalent of Shadday. While he also appears in other apocalyptic writings he is most prominent in the Apocalypse of Zerubbabel. In these writings he plays the role of heavenly interlocutor delivering knowledge about the coming messianic age.\nIslam.\nThe earliest account of Metatron within Islamic scriptures might derive directly from the &lt;a href=\"Quran\"&gt;Quran&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;a href=\"Uzair\"&gt;Uzair&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href=\"Surah\"&gt;Surah&lt;/a&gt; 9:30-31 venerated as a \"Son of God\" by Jews, is another name for the prophet Ezra, who was also identified with Metatron in Merkabah Mysticism. &lt;a href=\"Heresiology\"&gt;Islamic heresiologists&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly accused Jews for venerating an angel as a \"lesser god\" (or an \"Incarnation of God\"), especially for celebrating &lt;a href=\"Rosh%20Hashanah\"&gt;Rosh Hashanah&lt;/a&gt;. The name itself is attested early in Islam by &lt;a href=\"Al-Kindi\"&gt;Al-Kindi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Al-Masudi\"&gt;Al-Masudi&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href=\"Druze\"&gt;Druze&lt;/a&gt; text about cosmology, he is mentioned among the canonical Archangels in Islamic traditions. &lt;a href=\"Al-Suyuti\"&gt;Al-Suyuti&lt;/a&gt; identifies him as the angel of the veil and only he knows about that which lies beyond. He is also frequently mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28supernatural%29\"&gt;magical works&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20al-Buni\"&gt;Ahmad al-Buni&lt;/a&gt;, who describes Metatron as wearing a crown and a lance, probably constituting the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Moses\"&gt;Staff of Moses&lt;/a&gt;. In other magical practises, he is invoked to ward off &lt;a href=\"jinn\"&gt;evil jinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shaitan\"&gt;devils&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28paranormal%29\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s and other magical threats.\n&lt;a href=\"Ibn%20Hazm\"&gt;Ibn Hazm&lt;/a&gt; mentions that &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt;, although regarding Metatron as an angel, would celebrate Metatron as a lesser god 10 days each year, probably a reference to &lt;a href=\"Rosh%20Hashanah\"&gt;Rosh Hashanah&lt;/a&gt; in connection with &lt;a href=\"Merkabah%20mysticism\"&gt;Merkabah mysticism&lt;/a&gt; that Metatron took part on the creation of the world."
