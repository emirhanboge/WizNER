    "text": "Kimmeter Park Green was a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; ground in &lt;a href=\"Annan%2C%20Dumfries%20and%20Galloway\"&gt;Annan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. It was the home ground of &lt;a href=\"Solway%20Star%20F.C.\"&gt;Solway Star&lt;/a&gt; from 1921 until 1939, and hosted &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish Football League&lt;/a&gt; matches between 1923 and 1926.\nHistory.\nSolway Star moved to Kimmeter Park Green in 1921 from their Summergate Park ground, which they had played at for only a year. The facilities at the new ground initially included a small stand on the western side of the pitch, as well as some changing rooms, and in 1923 a new 300-capacity grandstand was built. In the same year the club were elected into the new Third Division of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish Football League&lt;/a&gt;, and the first SFL match at Kimmeter Park Green was played on 25 August 1923, a 2\u20131 win over &lt;a href=\"Peebles%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Peebles Rovers&lt;/a&gt;. The club's highest recorded league attendance at the ground was 3,000, set for a match against &lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20the%20South%20F.C.\"&gt;Queen of the South&lt;/a&gt; on 11 October 1924; the match ending in a 1\u20131 draw.\nDivision Three was disbanded at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1925%E2%80%9326%20Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;1925\u201326 season&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in Solway Star leaving the league. The final SFL match at the ground was played on 3 April 1926, a 3\u20132 defeat by &lt;a href=\"Johnstone%20F.C.\"&gt;Johnstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe club ceased playing at the ground in 1939, moving to Mafeking Park after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The site of Kimmeter Park Green was returned to agricultural use; the grandstand was partially demolished and the remainder of the structure used as a cowshed."
