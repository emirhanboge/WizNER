    "text": "Apur\u00edmac () is a department and region in southern-central &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;. It is bordered on the east by the &lt;a href=\"Cusco%20Region\"&gt;Cusco Region&lt;/a&gt;, on the west by the &lt;a href=\"Ayacucho%20Region\"&gt;Ayacucho Region&lt;/a&gt;, and on the south by the &lt;a href=\"Arequipa%20Region\"&gt;Arequipa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayacucho%20Region\"&gt;Ayacucho&lt;/a&gt; regions. The region's name originates from the &lt;a href=\"Quechua%20language\"&gt;Quechua language&lt;/a&gt; and means \"where the gods speak\" in reference to the many mountains of the region (gods in the andean religion) that seem to be talking to each other.\nPolitical division.\nThe region is divided into 7 &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;s (\"provincias\", singular: \"provincia\"), which are composed of 80 &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Peru\"&gt;district&lt;/a&gt;s (\"distritos\", singular: \"distrito\"). The provinces, with their capitals in parenthesis, are:\nDemographics.\nLanguages.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Peru%20Census\"&gt;2007 Peru Census&lt;/a&gt;, the first language learned by most of the residents was &lt;a href=\"Quechua%20language\"&gt;Quechua&lt;/a&gt; (70.58%) followed by &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; (29.01%). The Quechua varieties spoken in Apur\u00edmac are &lt;a href=\"Cusco%20Quechua\"&gt;Cusco Quechua&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chanka%20Quechua\"&gt;Chanka Quechua&lt;/a&gt;. The following table shows the results concerning the language learnt first in the Apur\u00edmac Region by province:\nEthnicity.\nOver 80% of the population identifies as &lt;a href=\"Quechua%20people\"&gt;Quechua&lt;/a&gt; as of 2017. \nReligion.\nMost of the population is Catholic at nearly 80%. \nLiteracy.\n80.8% (324,938) of the population is literate and 19.2% (77,347) of the population is illiterate. \nHistory.\nLittle is known about the region's origins, however chroniclers note that the first settlers were formed by tribes of several regions originating among the Quechua and Aymaras. The Chancas, originally from Choclococha and Huancavelica, settled in the region of Andahuaylas. This group of tribes is historically known as rebellious and fearless warriors of ancient Peru.\nChronicles relate that the Chancas prepared themselves for years to conquer the imperial city of Cusco. Only due to the great figure and strategy of &lt;a href=\"Pachacuti\"&gt;Inca Pachacutec&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Inca%20Empire\"&gt;Inca Empire&lt;/a&gt; did not yield.\nBy the time the conquerors established the first political organization of the Colony, almost the whole extension of the current region was under the jurisdiction of the authorities of Huamanga; nevertheless, there is no recollection on the foundation of cities and towns.\nAt the beginning of the Republic, Abancay belonged to Cusco. It was not until April 28, 1873, that a law was given to create the department of Apur\u00edmac, based on the provinces of Andahuaylas (Ayacucho), Antabamba, Aymaraes and Cotabambas (Cusco), and naming Abancay as its capital.\nAttractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Abancay\"&gt;Abancay&lt;/a&gt; is the capital and most important economic and political center. Also in the region is &lt;a href=\"Andahuaylas\"&gt;Andahuaylas&lt;/a&gt;, a rather cold city, located at 2980 meters above sea level (9,800\u00a0ft) and the region's agricultural centre. Its main church is the Cathedral de San Pedro, built in Colonial style architecture. A one-piece stone fountain stands out in the Plaza de Armas. Close to Abancay in the way to Cusco is the famed &lt;a href=\"Sayhuite\"&gt;Saywite Stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother notable place favored by visitors is &lt;a href=\"Talavera%20de%20la%20Reyna\"&gt;Talavera de la Reyna&lt;/a&gt;, located from Andahuaylas. The main square or Plaza de Armas is remarkable, built in stone with an impressive tower with a clock. Nearby, the thermal baths of Hualalache may be visited.\n&lt;a href=\"Chalhuanca\"&gt;Chalhuanca&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the province of Aymaraes, located at 2,800 m (2,100\u00a0ft), preserves beautiful churches built during Colonial times, containing fine wood carvings and gold leaf. A detailed account of Apur\u00edmac 's architecture can be found in the works of Peruvian Writer and architect Armando Arteaga.\nIn Antabamba, &lt;a href=\"trepanation\"&gt;trepanation&lt;/a&gt;s so accurately performed that astonishing medicines have been found there, in addition to mud sculptures, weapons, domestic utensils, and hunting implements.\nConsidered one of the largest and most beautiful lakes of Peru, &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Pacucha\"&gt;Paqucha&lt;/a&gt; Lake is located at 3,000 m (9,800\u00a0ft) in the route between Andahuaylas and Abancay. Known as an ideal place to rest and enjoy nature, fishing and duck hunting are permitted.\nLocal customs.\nTypical dishes and beverages.\nA typical Apur\u00edmac Region dish is the \"wathiya\". Traceable to ancient times, this is prepared by building a fire surrounded by stones, on the center of which potatoes are placed until done. The ancient settlers used to prepare it during sowing and harvesting.\nA dish that is also well known in Apur\u00edmac is potatoes and eggs with \"uchullaqwa\", a sauce made with &lt;a href=\"chili%20con%20carne\"&gt;chili&lt;/a&gt;, cottage cheese and \"&lt;a href=\"Tagetes%20minuta\"&gt;Tagetes minuta&lt;/a&gt;\", a culinary herb known in Peru as \"wakatay\", a word that derives from the Quechua language. Among the variety of breads, we find \"rejillas\", \"tarapacos\", \"paltos\" and \"roscas\".\nFestivities.\nJanuary 1 through 6 feature New Year's celebrations in Andahuaylas. During this period the \"Baja de Negros\" (dancers disguised as black men) is celebrated. There is entertainment of all sorts, especially religious &lt;a href=\"folklore\"&gt;folklore&lt;/a&gt;.\nFebruary is celebrated with Carnivals. The whole town fills the streets to participate in \"La Yunsa\". It is the only opportunity in which Apur\u00edmac shows all its folklore, with disguised groups dancing through all quarters. In Andahuaylas, women and men dance in groups day and night. In Grau, bullfights are organized, and the day before, the torril velacuy or velada de toros takes place to drive away evil spirits and avoid any harm to the toreros. In Aymaraes, a &lt;a href=\"sling%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;sling&lt;/a&gt; tournament between several districts takes place, a kind of duel, at times typically leaving several participants wounded.\nMay 13. \"Fiesta de la Virgen de F\u00e1tima\".
