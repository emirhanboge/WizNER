    "text": "William Adolf Wambsganss (March 19, 1894 \u2013 December 8, 1985) was a &lt;a href=\"second%20baseman\"&gt;second baseman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href=\"1914%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1914&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"1926%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1926&lt;/a&gt;, Wambsganss played for the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Indians\"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Athletics\"&gt;Philadelphia Athletics&lt;/a&gt;. He is best remembered for making one of the most spectacular defensive plays in &lt;a href=\"World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; history, an &lt;a href=\"unassisted%20triple%20play\"&gt;unassisted triple play&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nWambsganss was born in &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, to a family of &lt;a href=\"German%20American\"&gt;German descent&lt;/a&gt;. He attended &lt;a href=\"Concordia%20College%20%28Indiana%29\"&gt;Concordia College&lt;/a&gt; and studied for the ministry before entering professional baseball.\nMajor league career.\nIn a 13-season career, Wambsganss posted a .259 &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt; with seven &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s and 521 &lt;a href=\"run%20batted%20in\"&gt;run batted in&lt;/a&gt; in 1492 games played. Due to his long surname, Wambsganss was often called \"Wamby\" by headline writers.\nWambsganss was the regular &lt;a href=\"second%20baseman\"&gt;second baseman&lt;/a&gt; of the Cleveland Indians for ten years. Over a thirteen-year Major League career, he amassed 4,269 &lt;a href=\"assist%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;assist&lt;/a&gt;s with 3,420 &lt;a href=\"putout\"&gt;putout&lt;/a&gt;s and turned 605 &lt;a href=\"double%20play\"&gt;double play&lt;/a&gt;s. He committed only 375 &lt;a href=\"error%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;errors&lt;/a&gt; in 8,064 &lt;a href=\"total%20chances\"&gt;chances&lt;/a&gt; for a significant .954 &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt;. Batting from the second or eighth spot, Wambsganss averaged 74.2 &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; per year from 1919 to 1923. He scored a career-high 89 runs in 1922. He hit a career-high .295 in 1918 and hit .290 in 1923, his last season with Cleveland. He was sent to the Boston Red Sox in the same trade that brought &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20Burns%20%28first%20baseman%29\"&gt;George Burns&lt;/a&gt; to the Indians.\nIn 1924 with Boston, Wambsganss hit .275 and collected career-highs in &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; (174) and runs (93). After a sub-par season in 1925, he was sold to the Philadelphia Athletics. He finished his Major League career with the A's in 1926, batting .352 in 54 games.\nWorld Series triple play.\nIn game five of the &lt;a href=\"1920%20World%20Series\"&gt;1920 World Series&lt;/a&gt; played at &lt;a href=\"League%20Park\"&gt;League Park&lt;/a&gt;, Wambsganss caught a fifth-inning line drive batted by &lt;a href=\"Clarence%20Mitchell%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Clarence Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, stepped on second base to retire &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Kilduff\"&gt;Pete Kilduff&lt;/a&gt;, and tagged &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Miller%20%28baseball%20catcher%29\"&gt;Otto Miller&lt;/a&gt; coming from first base, to complete the only unassisted triple play in World Series history. Earlier in the game, Wambsganss' teammate &lt;a href=\"Elmer%20Smith%20%2820th%20century%20outfielder%29\"&gt;Elmer Smith&lt;/a&gt; hit the first &lt;a href=\"grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;grand slam&lt;/a&gt; in World Series history off Brooklyn Robins &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Burleigh%20Grimes\"&gt;Burleigh Grimes&lt;/a&gt;, in the first inning with none out. The historic blast scored &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Jamieson\"&gt;Charlie Jamieson&lt;/a&gt;, Wambsganss, &lt;a href=\"Tris%20Speaker\"&gt;Tris Speaker&lt;/a&gt;, and Smith. Brooklyn fell to the Indians in an 8\u20131 loss. Cleveland winning pitcher &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Bagby%2C%20Sr.\"&gt;Jim Bagby&lt;/a&gt; helped himself by hitting a three-run home run in the third. It was the first home run hit by a pitcher in modern World Series history.\nAfter the World Series, Cleveland fans presented Wambsganss with a medal to commemorate the unassisted triple play. The medal was lost the following April while Wambsganss was traveling aboard a train.\nPost-MLB career.\nAfter his last year in the Major Leagues, Wambsganss played for Triple-A Kansas City of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20%2820th%20century%29\"&gt;American Association&lt;/a&gt;. After coaching New Orleans of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Atlantic%20League%20%281904%E2%80%931963%29\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt; in 1930, he returned to the Kansas City club as &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; in 1931.\nAdditionally, he managed for four seasons in the &lt;a href=\"All-American%20Girls%20Professional%20Baseball%20League\"&gt;All-American Girls Professional Baseball League&lt;/a&gt; (AAGPBL) for the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Wayne%20Daisies\"&gt;Fort Wayne Daisies&lt;/a&gt; (1945\u201346) and the &lt;a href=\"Muskegon%20Lassies\"&gt;Muskegon Lassies&lt;/a&gt; (1947\u201348). In November 1988, Wambsganss and the rest of the AAGPBL received recognition when the &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum\"&gt;Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Cooperstown, New York&lt;/a&gt; dedicated a permanent display to the entire league. The gymnasium at &lt;a href=\"Concordia%20Theological%20Seminary\"&gt;Concordia Theological Seminary&lt;/a&gt; is named in honor of him.\nLater life.\nWhen interviewed in the 1960s by &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20Ritter\"&gt;Lawrence Ritter&lt;/a&gt; for the classic 1966 oral history \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Glory%20of%20Their%20Times\"&gt;The Glory of Their Times&lt;/a&gt;\", Wambsganss recalled: \"Funny thing, I played in the big leagues for 13 years, 1914 through 1926, and the only thing that anybody seems to remember is that once I made an unassisted triple play in a World Series. Many don't even remember the team I was on, or the position I played, or anything. Just Wambsganss-unassisted triple play! You'd think I was born on the day before and died on the day after.\"\nWambsganss died of heart failure in &lt;a href=\"Lakewood%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Lakewood, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, on December 8, 1985. He was 91 years old. Wambsganss was buried at &lt;a href=\"Calvary%20Cemetery%20%28Cleveland%29\"&gt;Calvary Cemetery in Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1958 film &lt;a href=\"Teacher%27s%20Pet%20%281958%20film%29\"&gt;\"Teacher's Pet\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clark%20Gable\"&gt;Clark Gable&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gig%20Young\"&gt;Gig Young&lt;/a&gt; argue whether Wambsganss' triple play took place in the 1920 or 1921 World Series."
