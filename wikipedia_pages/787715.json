    "text": "International rules football (; also known as international rules in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and compromise rules or Aussie rules in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;) is a &lt;a href=\"team%20sport\"&gt;team sport&lt;/a&gt; consisting of a &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20sport\"&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; codes, which was developed to facilitate international representative matches between &lt;a href=\"Australian%20rules%20football\"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; players and &lt;a href=\"Gaelic%20football\"&gt;Gaelic football&lt;/a&gt; players.\nThe first tour, known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Australian%20Football%20World%20Tour\"&gt;the Australian Football World Tour&lt;/a&gt;, took place in 1967, with matches played in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, games were played between &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and a touring &lt;a href=\"Meath%20GAA\"&gt;County Meath&lt;/a&gt; Gaelic football team, Meath being the reigning &lt;a href=\"1967%20All-Ireland%20Senior%20Football%20Championship%20Final\"&gt;All-Ireland senior football champions&lt;/a&gt;. Following intermittent international tests between Australia and Ireland, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Rules%20Series\"&gt;International Rules Series&lt;/a&gt; between the senior &lt;a href=\"Australian%20international%20rules%20football%20team\"&gt;Australian international rules football team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20international%20rules%20football%20team\"&gt;Ireland international rules football team&lt;/a&gt; has been played intermittently since 1984, and has generally been a closely matched contest. The sport has raised interest and exposure in developing markets for Gaelic and Australian football and has been considered a development tool by governing bodies of both codes, particularly by the &lt;a href=\"AFL%20Commission\"&gt;AFL Commission&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational rules football does not have any dedicated clubs or leagues. It is currently played by men's, women's, and junior teams only in &lt;a href=\"tournament\"&gt;tournaments&lt;/a&gt; or Test matches.\nRules.\nOverview.\nThe rules are designed to provide a compromise or combine between those of the two codes, with Gaelic football players being advantaged by the use of a round ball and a rectangular field measured about long by wide (Australian rules uses an oval ball and field), while the Australian rules football players benefit from the opportunity to &lt;a href=\"tackle%20%28football%20move%29\"&gt;tackle&lt;/a&gt; by grabbing between the shoulders and thighs and pulling to the ground, something banned in Gaelic football. The game also introduces the concept of the &lt;a href=\"mark%20%28Australian%20football%29\"&gt;mark&lt;/a&gt;, from Australian rules football, with a free kick awarded for a ball caught from a kick of over , where the kick must be in the forward direction if originating from a teammate.\nA player must bounce, solo (kick into one's own hands) or touch the ball on the ground once every or six steps. A maximum of two bounces per possession are allowed, while players can solo the ball as often as they wish on a possession. Unlike in Gaelic football, the ball may be lifted directly off the ground, without putting a foot underneath it first. Players however cannot scoop the ball off the ground to a team-mate, nor pick up the ball if they are on their knees or on the ground. If a foul is committed, a free kick will be awarded, though referees (called umpires in Australian Rules) can give the fouled player advantage to play on at their discretion.\nThe game uses two large posts usually set apart, and connected above the ground by a &lt;a href=\"Goal%20%28sport%29\"&gt;crossbar&lt;/a&gt; with a goal net that could extend behind the goalposts and attached to the crossbar and lower goalposts, as in Gaelic football. A further apart on either side of those and not connected by a crossbar are 2 small posts, known as behind posts, as in Australian rules football.\nPoints are scored as follows:\nScores are written so as to clarify how many of each type of score were made as well as, like Australian football, giving the total points score for each team; for example, if a team scores one goal, four overs and 10 behinds, the score is written as 1\u20134\u201310 (28), meaning one goal (six points) plus 4 overs (4 \u00d7 3 = 12 points) plus 10 behinds (10 \u00d7 1 = 10 points), for a total score of 28 points.\nAn international rules match lasts for 72 minutes (divided into four quarters of 18 minutes each). Inter-county Gaelic football matches go on for 70 minutes, divided into two halves, while Australian rules matches consist of four 20-minute quarters of game time (although with the addition of &lt;a href=\"Time%20on%20%28Australian%20rules%20football%29\"&gt;stoppage time&lt;/a&gt;, most quarters actually last around 30 minutes).\nAs in Gaelic football, teams consist of fifteen players, including a &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28Gaelic%20games%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt;, whereas eighteen are used in Australian rules (with no keeper).\nAlterations.\nA number of rule changes were introduced before the &lt;a href=\"2006%20International%20Rules%20Series\"&gt;2006 International Rules Series&lt;/a&gt;:\nFurther alterations were made before the &lt;a href=\"2008%20International%20Rules%20Series\"&gt;2008 International Rules Series&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe most recent changes were made ahead of the &lt;a href=\"2014%20International%20Rules%20Series\"&gt;2014 International Rules Series&lt;/a&gt;:\nAround the world.\nInternational rules has been played in various locations throughout North America and the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, and Australia and New Zealand between fledgling Australian rules football and Gaelic football clubs.\nIn 2006, an exhibition match between South African youth teams and an &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20Australian\"&gt;Indigenous Australian&lt;/a&gt; touring side composed of players from the &lt;a href=\"Clontarf%20Foundation\"&gt;Clontarf Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Swans\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Goodes\"&gt;Adam Goodes&lt;/a&gt;, was held at &lt;a href=\"Potchefstroom%2C%20North%20West\"&gt;Potchefstroom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Birmingham\"&gt;University of Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; holds an annual International Rules match between its Australian Rules football team and its Gaelic Football team, with the 2013 edition won by the Australian Rules team 56\u201355, before a crowd of over 400 students.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"International%20Rules%20Series\"&gt;International Rules Series&lt;/a&gt;, the most well-known International Rules event, Australia and Ireland are at an impasse, with 10 series wins apiece. Most recently in 2017, Australia defeated Ireland with two Test wins and an aggregate score of 116\u2013103.\nAmateur tours.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Amateur%20Football%20Council\"&gt;Australian Amateur Football Council&lt;/a&gt; has sent an amateur Under-23 All-Australian team to Ireland in both 2005 and 2008. The Australian amateur team wore a different jersey to the AFL representative side, dark green and gold, with a kangaroo emblem. Recently, the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Amateur%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Victorian Amateur Football Association&lt;/a&gt; (VAFA) has sent a squad of players sourced from the top six divisions of its competition to tour Ireland and play various clubs and representative teams.
