The mountain has an elevation of &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Height%20Datum\"&gt;above sea level&lt;/a&gt;.\nMount Stirling is also an abbreviation of the Mount Stirling Alpine Resort, a &lt;a href=\"Cross-country%20skiing\"&gt;cross-country&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Backcountry%20skiing\"&gt;backcountry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ski%20resort\"&gt;ski resort&lt;/a&gt; located on the slopes of the mountain and situated approximately from &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. The Mount Stirling ski resort is a popular location for beginner backcountry skiers and &lt;a href=\"snowboarder\"&gt;snowboarder&lt;/a&gt;s due to its distance from Melbourne and proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Buller%20Alpine%20Resort\"&gt;Mount Buller Alpine Resort&lt;/a&gt;. As at the &lt;a href=\"Census%20in%20Australia%232011\"&gt;2011 census&lt;/a&gt;, the area had a population of 36.\nThe Mount Stirling Alpine Resort is contained within an &lt;a href=\"Unincorporated%20areas%20of%20Australia\"&gt;unincorporated area&lt;/a&gt; under the direct administration of the government of Victoria, and is surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"Shire%20of%20Mansfield\"&gt;Shire of Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;.\nMount Stirling was named in honour of James Stirling, a &lt;a href=\"Surveying\"&gt;surveyor&lt;/a&gt; and later, the Victorian Government Geologist.\nLocation and features.\nThe mountain and ski resort are located at the head of the &lt;a href=\"Delatite%20River\"&gt;Delatite River&lt;/a&gt;, which flows westwards. It is surrounded by the Stirling Circuit Road, which provides access to mountains further into the Victorian Alps. In winter the road is closed at Telephone Box Junction, from which it is generally possible to ski to reach the summit (depending on conditions it is sometimes necessary to walk the lower section).\nThe mountain has fantastic views across to nearby &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Buller%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Mount Buller&lt;/a&gt; as well as the high range that runs from &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Cobbler\"&gt;Mount Cobbler&lt;/a&gt; through Mount Speculation and the Cross cut Saw and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Howitt\"&gt;Mount Howitt&lt;/a&gt;. From there the range swings westwards, finishing in The Bluff, an impressive tilted plateau that has large clifflines on its northern side.\nThe lower reaches of the mountain are dominated by Alpine Ash forests, which merge into Snowgum Woodlands above approximately . There is a small part of the summit area which sits above treeline.\nHuts.\nThere are a number of huts in the area of Mount Stirling providing emergency refuge to visitors:\nSeasonal activities.\nIn winter the area is a patrolled &lt;a href=\"Cross-country%20skiing\"&gt;cross country&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Backcountry%20skiing\"&gt;back country&lt;/a&gt; ski resort. Maps of ski trails are available at the entry gate.\nIn summer the area is popular with &lt;a href=\"Off-roading\"&gt;four wheel drivers&lt;/a&gt; and bush walkers. The trail from the Circuit Road to the summit takes less than two hours to walk and is popular for day and over night trips. Also, when it is not snowing or in danger of bushfires, the area is used by numerous educational groups."
