    "text": "The Pearson 22 is an American &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20sailer\"&gt;trailerable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt; that was designed by &lt;a href=\"William%20Shaw%20%28yacht%20designer%29\"&gt;William Shaw&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Sailing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;racer&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Cruising%20%28maritime%29\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and first built in 1968.\nProduction.\nThe design was built by &lt;a href=\"Pearson%20Yachts\"&gt;Pearson Yachts&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; from 1968 until 1972, but it is now out of production.\nDesign.\nThe Pearson 22 is a recreational &lt;a href=\"keelboat\"&gt;keelboat&lt;/a&gt;, built predominantly of &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"balsa\"&gt;balsa&lt;/a&gt;-cored deck. It has a &lt;a href=\"Fractional%20rig\"&gt;fractional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sloop\"&gt;sloop&lt;/a&gt; rig, a &lt;a href=\"raked%20stem\"&gt;raked stem&lt;/a&gt;, a slightly &lt;a href=\"reverse%20transom\"&gt;reverse transom&lt;/a&gt;, an internally mounted spade-type &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"tiller\"&gt;tiller&lt;/a&gt; and a fixed swept fin &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt;. It displaces and carries of ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of with the standard keel and is normally fitted with a small &lt;a href=\"outboard%20motor\"&gt;outboard motor&lt;/a&gt; for docking and maneuvering.\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with a double &lt;a href=\"%26quot%3BV%26quot%3B-berth\"&gt;\"V\"-berth&lt;/a&gt; in the bow cabin and two straight settee berths in the main cabin. The &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; is located on both sides just aft of the bow cabin. The galley is equipped with an optional stove and a sink. The &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is located in the bow cabin under the \"V\"-berth. Cabin headroom is .\nThe design has a &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Handicap%20Racing%20Fleet\"&gt;PHRF&lt;/a&gt; racing average handicap of 246 and a &lt;a href=\"hull%20speed\"&gt;hull speed&lt;/a&gt; of .\nOperational history.\nIn a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, \"Pearson's literature bills this boat as 'to sailing what a sports car is to driving\u2014a high performance ... beautifully balanced design that puts fun into getting there ... took the season championship although she was the smallest boat in her fleet ... headed for one-design racing in many areas.' In hindsight, it appears that reality did not match the brochure writer's dreams. She was discontinued after four years, superseded by slightly larger cruisers like the Pearson 26. Best features: With more ballast, lower center of gravity, and the highest D/L ratio versus her otherwise very similar comp[etitor]s, the Pearson 22 is probably the stiffest boat in the group. That may make her fastest too, sailing without handicap, at least in a moderate breeze. (Her PHRF rating indicates she's fastest, too.) Worst features: She's neither wide nor tall down below, giving her relatively low points on the Space Index scale. The outboard engine controls are far aft of the cockpit, and the prop is beyond the counter stern, which would make us worry about prop cavitation when hobby horsing in a seaway.\""
