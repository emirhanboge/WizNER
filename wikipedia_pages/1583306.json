    "text": "Arsenal Special Device Production State Enterprise (), also known as the Arsenal Factory, is one of the oldest and most famous &lt;a href=\"factory\"&gt;factories&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPre-1918.\nThe factory was established in 1764 as a repair and production facility of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russian%20Army\"&gt;Imperial Russian Army&lt;/a&gt; and the factory was initially based in a &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20Fortress\"&gt;Kyiv Fortress&lt;/a&gt; compound in the &lt;a href=\"Pecherskyi%20District\"&gt;Pechersk&lt;/a&gt; (\u041f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a) district of the city. It is now a large state-owned company. Workers at the factory included sniper &lt;a href=\"Lyudmila%20Pavlichenko\"&gt;Lyudmila Pavlichenko&lt;/a&gt;, who worked as a &lt;a href=\"Grinding%20machine\"&gt;grinder&lt;/a&gt; at the factory prior to 1941.\nThe Revolution and World War II events.\nOn January 29, 1918, the workers of the factory organized an armed pro-&lt;a href=\"Bolshevik\"&gt;Bolshevik&lt;/a&gt; mutiny known as a &lt;a href=\"Kiev%20Arsenal%20mutiny\"&gt;Kiev Arsenal mutiny&lt;/a&gt; or a \"January Rebellion\" against &lt;a href=\"Tsentral%27na%20Rada\"&gt;Tsentral'na Rada&lt;/a&gt;, the Ukrainian assembly that declared the independence of Ukraine. To commemorate the event, the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; authorities preserved the historic defensive wall bearing the traces of shelling (situated on the city's \"Moskovs'ka Street\" near the \"Arsenal'na\" &lt;a href=\"Kyiv%20Metro\"&gt;metro&lt;/a&gt; station).\nWhile the civil production lines were added to the factory starting from 1918, the factory produced mostly the military related products throughout its history. In the 1920s, 1930s and during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; the factory mainly produced &lt;a href=\"artillery\"&gt;artillery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anti-tank\"&gt;anti-tank&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"anti-aircraft\"&gt;anti-aircraft&lt;/a&gt; guns. In summer 1941, immediately after the outbreak of the war between the Soviet Union and the Axis powers, the factory was quickly evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Perm%2C%20Russia\"&gt;Perm&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20mountains\"&gt;Ural mountains&lt;/a&gt;, far from hostilities. The factory buildings in Kiev suffered heavy damages from German &lt;a href=\"bombing\"&gt;bombing&lt;/a&gt;s. The relocated \"Arsenal\" continued to play a major role in arming the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-war.\nAfter the war, the Arsenal factory was reestablished anew at its Kyiv location and partly converted into a &lt;a href=\"Civilian\"&gt;civil&lt;/a&gt; company named \"Zavod Arsenal\" (while the other, smaller, part remained an unremarkable &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; repairing facility under a different name). Since that time, the name \"Arsenal\" is mostly associated with the larger company rather than with the military one (occupying the oldest building of old arsenal). During the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"arms%20race\"&gt;arms race&lt;/a&gt;, Arsenal developed dramatically, becoming an important manufacturer of the military-related products and employing tens of thousands of people. The factory mainly specialized in optical components for the Soviet military and &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20space%20program\"&gt;space programs&lt;/a&gt;. The factory also produced the professional grade photographic &lt;a href=\"cameras\"&gt;cameras&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kiev-Arsenal%20%28photo%20camera%29\"&gt;\"Kiev\"&lt;/a&gt; but civil production played only a minor role in factory output. Tens of thousands of people where employed at the \"Arsenal\".\nPerestroika and independence.\nAfter the beginning of &lt;a href=\"perestroika\"&gt;perestroika&lt;/a&gt;, military orders dropped drastically and the Arsenal factory fell into a crisis which is still ongoing. The management attempted to &lt;a href=\"arms%20industry%20conversion\"&gt;convert&lt;/a&gt; the factory by concentrating more on consumer optics and other civil products, but these attempts did little to help the factory to emerge from the crisis. Comparatively insignificant figures of civil production sales could not support the employment of military-specialized workers in such numbers and maintain the gigantic premises.\nToday, control systems, gyroscopes, accelerometers and other products are used to create &lt;a href=\"Neptune%20%28cruise%20missile%29\"&gt;'Neptune'&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vilkha%20%28missile%20complex%29\"&gt;'Vilkha'&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hrim-2%20%28missile%20system%29\"&gt;'Hrim-2'&lt;/a&gt; missiles and missile systems, &lt;a href=\"RK-3%20Corsar\"&gt;'Korsar'&lt;/a&gt;, ATGM. Products of the company are used in Ukrainian space program.\nCivil production includes consumer optics, medical and banking equipment, gauges for the &lt;a href=\"natural%20gas\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"light-emitting%20diode\"&gt;optical diode&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"traffic%20lights\"&gt;traffic lights&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the company performs calculations and manufacturing of optical systems and other products to order.\nArt museum project.\nIn 2004, a Ukrainian &lt;a href=\"business%20oligarch\"&gt;oligarch&lt;/a&gt; and art &lt;a href=\"philanthropist\"&gt;philanthropist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Viktor%20Pinchuk\"&gt;Viktor Pinchuk&lt;/a&gt; suggested to establish a &lt;a href=\"modern%20art\"&gt;modern art&lt;/a&gt; gallery in the oldest 19th century building of the Arsenal. This large fortress-like &lt;a href=\"brick\"&gt;brick&lt;/a&gt; structure, situated on the \"Tsytadel'na Street\" and recognized as &lt;a href=\"architectural\"&gt;architectural&lt;/a&gt; monument, now belongs to the Ukrainian military and is poorly maintained. Later, &lt;a href=\"Viktor%20Yushchenko\"&gt;Viktor Yushchenko&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Ukraine\"&gt;President of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, expressed his support to the museum idea but suggested that the museum had to be state-run and dominated by more traditional art pieces in order to become a \"Ukrainian &lt;a href=\"Hermitage%20Museum\"&gt;Hermitage&lt;/a&gt;\". The process of converting the building to a civil use succeeded and in 2007 the museum called &lt;a href=\"Art%20Arsenal\"&gt;Art Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; (Mystetskyi Arsenal) was officially opened. Nowadays, &lt;a href=\"Art%20Arsenal\"&gt;Art Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; (Mystetskyi Arsenal) which is based in some buildings of the Arsenal enterprise, is one of the biggest and most popular art location in Ukraine."
