    "text": "Joshua Hopkins Marvil (September 3, 1825 \u2013 April 8, 1895) was an American merchant and politician from Laurel, in &lt;a href=\"Sussex%20County%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;Sussex County, Delaware&lt;/a&gt;. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;, who served as Governor of &lt;a href=\"Delaware\"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and family.\nMarvil was born in &lt;a href=\"Laurel%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;Laurel, Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Joseph and Sally Ann Hopkins Marvil. He married Sarah Ann Sirman and had three children: Joseph, Vendreths, and Joshua. They lived at West Street in Laurel, although the house has been moved to 606 West Street. They were members of the &lt;a href=\"Methodist%20Church\"&gt;Methodist Church&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a young man, Marvil went to sea for a while and returned to work in shipbuilding. At age 28, in 1853, he began to manufacture farm equipment. Having a certain mechanical genius, he was able to imagine profitable new technologies. With the growth of the &lt;a href=\"peach\"&gt;peach&lt;/a&gt; orchards, he started the Marvil Package Company, a basket and crate manufacturing business in Laurel. For a time, it was said to have been the largest industrial plant in the area, producing two million fruit baskets and crates annually. He was also the publisher of Laurel's first newspaper, the \"Gazette\", which he started in 1889.\nProfessional and political career.\nMarvil had been an enrollment officer during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. He became a Republican at that time, and remained one in heavily &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; western Sussex County. Nevertheless, he was popular, and after refusing his party's nomination for governor in 1882 and 1890, he finally agreed in 1894, in spite of his advanced age and poor physical condition.\nIn the election, Marvil was elected &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20governors%20of%20Delaware\"&gt;Governor of Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, defeating Democrat &lt;a href=\"Ebe%20W.%20Tunnell\"&gt;Ebe W. Tunnell&lt;/a&gt;, a merchant from &lt;a href=\"Lewes%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;Lewes&lt;/a&gt;. Marvil was only the second Republican governor, and the first elected since the Civil War. He feared his health would not last through his term, and after one of the coldest winters on record, his prediction came true. He served less than three months, from January 15, 1895 until his death on April 8, 1895.\nFor a generation bitter memories of Republican actions during the Civil War had kept the Democrats firmly in control of the government throughout Delaware. However, during this period gas executive &lt;a href=\"J.%20Edward%20Addicks\"&gt;J. Edward Addicks&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; millionaire, established residence in Delaware, and began pouring money into the Republican Party, especially in &lt;a href=\"Kent%20County%2C%20Delaware\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; and Sussex County. He expected this investment to earn him a seat in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Senate\"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt;, and while that never happened, he did succeed in reigniting the Republican Party, which would soon become the dominant party in the state. Marvil's election was accompanied by the election of a Republican State House, and the convening of a state constitutional convention that would soon produce a new constitution.\nDeath and legacy.\nMarvil died at his home and is buried in the Laurel Hill Cemetery, at Laurel. He was the ninth and last Governor of Delaware to die in office. Marvil's grandson, Joshua D. Marvil, attended &lt;a href=\"Northwestern%20University\"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;, where in 1931 he was named one of Delaware's first All-American &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; players.\nAlmanac.\nElections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. The governor takes office the third Tuesday of January, and has a four-year term."
