    "text": "Gary Walsh (born 21 March 1968) is an English &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; coach and professional former footballer who is the head goalkeeping coach at &lt;a href=\"West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.%20C.\"&gt;West Bromwich Albion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a player, he was a &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt; from 1985 to 2006, notably playing &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; football with &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Oldham Athletic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Wigan Athletic&lt;/a&gt;. He also played in Scotland for &lt;a href=\"Airdrieonians%20F.C.%20%281878%29\"&gt;Airdrieonians&lt;/a&gt;. He was capped twice by at &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team\"&gt;England U21&lt;/a&gt; level.\nFollowing his retirement he moved into coaching and has been the goalkeeping coach at Wigan Athletic, &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hartlepool%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Hartlepool United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nManchester United.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Wigan\"&gt;Wigan&lt;/a&gt;, Walsh left school in 1984 and signed for &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Wigan Athletic&lt;/a&gt; as an apprentice. He was originally a striker but was fielded as goalkeeper in a game being watched by a &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; scout. He was promptly offered an apprenticeship by Manchester United manager &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Atkinson\"&gt;Ron Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, and accepted the offer. He kept goal for United as they finished runners-up to neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; in the 1986 &lt;a href=\"FA%20Youth%20Cup\"&gt;FA Youth Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalsh was given a professional contract for the &lt;a href=\"1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1986\u201387 season&lt;/a&gt; (during which Ron Atkinson was sacked in favour of &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Ferguson\"&gt;Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;) and made his first-team debut soon after. He played 14 league games that season.\nFor a short time in the &lt;a href=\"1987%E2%80%9388%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1987\u201388 season&lt;/a&gt;, a 19-year-old Walsh was made first-choice goalkeeper after &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Bailey\"&gt;Gary Bailey&lt;/a&gt; retired due to injury and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Turner%20%28footballer%20born%201958%29\"&gt;Chris Turner&lt;/a&gt; was dropped from the team. He played in 16 league games before his run in the first team was halted by a head injury sustained in a mid-season friendly in &lt;a href=\"Bermuda\"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;, and a succession of further injuries ruled him out until the &lt;a href=\"1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1990\u201391 season&lt;/a&gt;. He was on the substitutes bench as United lifted the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt; that season, and the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Schmeichel\"&gt;Peter Schmeichel&lt;/a&gt; that summer made his first-team opportunities even more limited.\nThe return of &lt;a href=\"Les%20Sealey\"&gt;Les Sealey&lt;/a&gt; (who had been at United for 18 months until the end of the &lt;a href=\"1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1990\u201391 season&lt;/a&gt;) in January 1993 meant that Walsh was now third choice goalkeeper, and the following season he was transfer-listed. He had also been out the squad for a while before Sealey's arrival, as United had brought in &lt;a href=\"Fraser%20Digby\"&gt;Fraser Digby&lt;/a&gt; on loan from &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt; as an (unused) understudy to Peter Schmeichel.\nHowever, United won the league title that season with three matches to spare, and to prepare his best players for the FA Cup final, Alex Ferguson selected Walsh as goalkeeper for the final three league games of the season and Walsh's form was so impressive that he gained a new contract, while the veteran &lt;a href=\"Les%20Sealey\"&gt;Les Sealey&lt;/a&gt; was released. Walsh was on the substitute's bench as United triumphed 4\u20130 over &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; on 14 May 1994 to complete the &lt;a href=\"Double%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;Double&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;, Walsh went on loan to &lt;a href=\"Airdrieonians%20F.C.%20%281878%29\"&gt;Airdrieonians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Oldham Athletic&lt;/a&gt;.\nA back injury suffered by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Schmeichel\"&gt;Peter Schmeichel&lt;/a&gt; in November 1994 saw Walsh selected for 10 subsequent Premier League games, during which he conceded just 12 goals, while the Dane recovered. Walsh also played in several &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Football League Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt; games that season, though when Schmeichel returned to fitness Walsh was back on the substitute's bench or in the reserves. Had United won the league title that season, Walsh would have collected the first (and ultimately the only) league title winner's medal of his career as he had met the minimum requirement for appearances to gain the accolade, but United were beaten to the league title by &lt;a href=\"Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackburn Rovers&lt;/a&gt; on the final day of the season when they failed to get the better of a &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt; side who held them to a 1\u20131 draw in east London.\nMiddlesbrough.\nA little frustrated at the lack of first team opportunities available to him, Walsh moved to &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; (managed by his former teammate &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20Robson\"&gt;Bryan Robson&lt;/a&gt;) for \u00a3600,000 in August 1995, and played in 32 out of 38 Premier League games that season for a newly promoted side which went fourth in October but in the end could only manage a 12th-place finish due to a terrible run of form during the winter. The following season, however, he managed just 12 league appearances due to the emergence of &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Roberts%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Ben Roberts&lt;/a&gt; and the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Schwarzer\"&gt;Mark Schwarzer&lt;/a&gt;. Middlesbrough also managed to reach both domestic cup finals that season. In the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; campaign, Walsh played in the quarter final victory over &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, but was not selected in the &lt;a href=\"1997%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; squad against &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt;, who beat Middlesbrough in a replay. In the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; run he played in the opening game of the campaign against &lt;a href=\"Chester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Chester City&lt;/a&gt;, but would not feature in the tournament again as his teammates went on to lose the &lt;a href=\"1997%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;. Walsh never played first team football for the &lt;a href=\"Riverside%20Stadium\"&gt;Riverside&lt;/a&gt; club again.\nBradford City.\nHe signed for &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt; on loan in October 1997 before a \u00a3500,000 fee made the transfer permanent.\nWalsh produced his best form in a number of years in the &lt;a href=\"1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1997\u201398 season&lt;/a&gt; and crowned a superb campaign by picking up the club's Player of the Year award. However, injury and the form of &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Clarke%20%28footballer%20born%201973%29\"&gt;Matt Clarke&lt;/a&gt; saw Walsh fall out of favour at Bradford City.\nAfter several troubled months, he emerged at the start of the &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2000\u201301 season&lt;/a&gt; campaign fully fit and ready to fight for his place (he also went on loan to former club &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; during this time).\nWigan Athletic.\nHe featured strongly over the next few years before joining &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Wigan Athletic&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 as back-up to &lt;a href=\"John%20Filan\"&gt;John Filan&lt;/a&gt;. On Wigan's promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, he signed a new one-year contract to see the club through their first as a top division side.\nHaving played three league games for Wigan, Walsh announced his retirement from playing in the summer of 2006.\nCoaching career.\nWalsh started his goalkeeping coach role during his playing time at Wigan, before taking it up on a permanent basis after he retired at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2005\u201306 season&lt;/a&gt;. He teamed up with former Wigan manager &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Jewell\"&gt;Paul Jewell&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt; on 3 January 2008. Following Jewell's departure from Derby, Walsh left in June 2009 and was appointed goalkeeping coach of &lt;a href=\"Hartlepool%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Hartlepool United&lt;/a&gt;. On 15 December 2011, Walsh was recruited by his former Middlesbrough teammate &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Barmby\"&gt;Nick Barmby&lt;/a&gt; to take over as goalkeeping coach at &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hull City&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 1 November 2016, Walsh left Hull City and joined former Hull City manager Steve Bruce at Aston Villa as goalkeeping coach. On 3 October 2018, head coach &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Bruce\"&gt;Steve Bruce&lt;/a&gt; and his entire coaching staff, including Walsh, were fired by the club."
