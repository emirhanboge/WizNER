    "text": "The (\"prefect of the provisions\") was a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman imperial&lt;/a&gt; official charged with the supervision of the &lt;a href=\"Grain%20supply%20to%20the%20city%20of%20Rome\"&gt;grain supply&lt;/a&gt; to the city of &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;. Under the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;, the job was usually done by an &lt;a href=\"aedile\"&gt;aedile&lt;/a&gt;. However, in emergencies, or in times of extraordinary scarcity, an individual would be elected to the office, and would take charge of supplying the entire city with provisions. &lt;a href=\"Lucius%20Minucius%20Augurinus\"&gt;Lucius Minucius Augurinus&lt;/a&gt;, the accuser of &lt;a href=\"Spurius%20Maelius\"&gt;Spurius Maelius&lt;/a&gt;, was the first individual appointed to this office, serving from 439\u00a0BC. During the early 60s\u00a0BC, following the sacking of the port of &lt;a href=\"Ostia%20Antica\"&gt;Ostia&lt;/a&gt; by pirates, &lt;a href=\"Pompey\"&gt;Pompey&lt;/a&gt; held the powers of the office. Around 7\u00a0BC, the first &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Augustus\"&gt;Augustus&lt;/a&gt;, followed this example, and after vesting himself with these powers, specified that two former &lt;a href=\"praetor\"&gt;praetor&lt;/a&gt;s should be appointed every year to carry out the functions of this office. Augustus transferred powers from the aedile to this office, and specified that all holders of this office be members of the &lt;a href=\"Equestrian%20order\"&gt;Equestrian order&lt;/a&gt;. Augustus also specified that these officers were to be aided by an \"adjutor\" (from the 2nd century the \"subpraefectus\"). Later, Augustus specified that these individuals must be of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20consul\"&gt;consular&lt;/a&gt; rank. After Augustus' reign, one individual would usually hold this office, and this continued until the fall of the Roman Empire.\nDuring the later Empire, further \"praefecti annonae\" were established for the city of &lt;a href=\"Alexandria\"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt; (Egypt) and the &lt;a href=\"Africa%20proconsularis\"&gt;province of Africa&lt;/a&gt;, the two chief sources of grain for the provisioning of Rome.\nList of known \"praefecti annonae urbis Romae\".\nThe entries from AD 14 to 337 are based on &lt;a href=\"Henriette%20Pavis%20d%27Escurac\"&gt;Henriette Pavis d'Escurac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.persee.fr/doc/befar_0257-4101_1976_mon_226_1\"&gt;\"La pr\u00e9fecture de l'annone, service administratif imp\u00e9rial d'Auguste \u00e0 Constantin (Biblioth\u00e8que des \u00c9coles fran\u00e7aises d'Ath\u00e8nes et de Rome, 226)\"&lt;/a&gt; (Rome: Ecole fran\u00e7aise de Rome, 1976)"
