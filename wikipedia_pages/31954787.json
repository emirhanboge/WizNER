    "text": "Tomislav Pavli\u010di\u0107 (born 6 December 1983) is a &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"midfielder\"&gt;midfielder&lt;/a&gt;, currently plays for &lt;a href=\"Balmaz%C3%BAjv%C3%A1rosi%20FC\"&gt;Balmaz\u00fajv\u00e1rosi FC&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nKnown for his free kick skills, Pavli\u010di\u0107 had a difficult start of his professional career. After the end of his first season at Croatian football club &lt;a href=\"HNK%20Cibalia\"&gt;Cibalia&lt;/a&gt; he was involved in a car accident, caused by an intoxicated driver who ran his car into Pavli\u010di\u0107's. Pavli\u010di\u0107 sustained heavy injuries of his leg and subsequently had to endure a knee operation that sidelined him for over six months. The recovery was hard and after his return to football he first had to prove himself at &lt;a href=\"NK%20Grani%C4%8Dar%20%C5%BDupanja\"&gt;Grani\u010dar \u017dupanja&lt;/a&gt; and a season later at &lt;a href=\"HNK%20Suhopolje\"&gt;Suhopolje&lt;/a&gt;, both members of the Croatian third division, &lt;a href=\"Tre%C4%87a%20HNL\"&gt;3.HNL&lt;/a&gt;. He had done that in big fashion as he scored a total of 52 goals in two season for both clubs. After a season at Suhopolje, where he scored an impressive 30 goals in 29 matches, he returned to Cibalia and was given a chance in Croatian top division, which he never let go. In his first &lt;a href=\"Prva%20HNL\"&gt;Prva HNL&lt;/a&gt; season after the injury he made 29 appearances for the club, scoring five goals and earning seven assists (the highest in the league during that season). The very next season he, already a team captain, was voted in the first squad of the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Prva%20HNL\"&gt;2009\u201310 Prva HNL&lt;/a&gt; season. After that season his contract with Cibalia expired and he had plenty of new offers from clubs at home and abroad. He eventually decided in favour of the &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;n side, &lt;a href=\"NK%20Maribor\"&gt;Maribor&lt;/a&gt;, signing a contract until June 2013. However, his stay in &lt;a href=\"Maribor\"&gt;Maribor&lt;/a&gt; was brief as he failed to fulfill the expectations of his new club and their fans and he returned to Cibalia after only one season.\nPersonal life.\nAfter his departure from Prva HNL he promised to the fans of Cibalia that he will eventually return to the club, where he plans to finish his professional career. Although he is left footed, he uses his right hand for writing."
