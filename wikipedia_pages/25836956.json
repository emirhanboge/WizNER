    "text": "The seclusion of girls at puberty has been practised in societies around the world, especially prior to the early 20th century. In such cultures, girls' &lt;a href=\"puberty\"&gt;puberty&lt;/a&gt; held more significance than boys' due to &lt;a href=\"Culture%20and%20menstruation\"&gt;menstruation&lt;/a&gt;, the girl's potential for giving birth, and widespread ideas of &lt;a href=\"ritual%20purification\"&gt;ritual purification&lt;/a&gt; related to the sacred power of blood. These societies practised various &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20passage\"&gt;rites of passage&lt;/a&gt;, many of which lost their original forms or completely disappeared with the emergence of modern trends such as &lt;a href=\"industrialization\"&gt;industrialization&lt;/a&gt;.\nRites.\nTwo rules were common in the seclusion of adolescent girls: the girl must neither touch the ground nor see the sun. According to &lt;a href=\"Sir%20James%20George%20Frazer\"&gt;Sir James George Frazer&lt;/a&gt;, these rules also applied to &lt;a href=\"divine%20king%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;divine king&lt;/a&gt;s and priests. These divine kings were carried on shoulders by their underlings who walked upon tapestry or carpet. Scholars have speculated that the &lt;a href=\"Paleolithic\"&gt;Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Venus%20figurines\"&gt;Venus figurines&lt;/a&gt; are related to such puberty rites as they lack facial features (not seeing the sun), their tapered legs without feet (not touching the ground), and their &lt;a href=\"adiposity\"&gt;adiposity&lt;/a&gt; (caused by seclusion).\nAmong puberty rites which Frazer described, many adhered to the above rules:\nFrazer believed that the Greek myth of &lt;a href=\"Dana%C3%AB\"&gt;Dana\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, who was kept by her father in seclusion but was impregnated by &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;, was related to girls' puberty rites. Lincoln also finds parallels between the Greek myth about the abduction of Persephone and the seclusion of girls at puberty. According to him, the seclusion of Tukuna girls at puberty may be referred to as \"being in the underworld\".\nReasons for the seclusion.\nPreparation for womanhood.\nSuch seclusion rites are linked to the social preparation of girls for womanhood and their roles as wives and mothers. During their seclusion, girls would be taught by older women about their future roles.\nSuperstition.\nFrazer claims the reason for seclusion practises was the \"deeply engrained dread\" of \"menstruous blood\". The first appearance of menstrual blood caused more fear than subsequent menstrual cycles. These fears stemmed more from &lt;a href=\"superstition\"&gt;superstition&lt;/a&gt; related to the sacred power of blood than from hygienic issues or the possible spread of disease.\nAmong the &lt;a href=\"Apache%20Indians\"&gt;Apache Indians&lt;/a&gt;, \"the adolescent girls are not segregated as sources of danger, but court is paid to them as to direct sources of supernatural blessing\". A girl at her first menstruation was considered to be possessed of \"a degree of supernatural power\" which, though not entirely malevolent, still aroused feelings of the \"power of evil\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bushmen\"&gt;Bushmen&lt;/a&gt; of South Africa believed that making eye contact with a girl during this period would make men \"fixed in whatever position they happen to occupy\".\nIn earlier societies, some pubescent girls might have shown some unusual behaviours, giving rise to superstitions. Such behaviours could have been triggered by a number of factors; for example, pubescent girls are more prone to &lt;a href=\"Depression%20%28mood%29\"&gt;depressive&lt;/a&gt; episodes than boys of a similar age. Historical records also show that these girls may have been subjects of &lt;a href=\"incest\"&gt;incestuous relationships&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"child%20abuse\"&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt;, triggering abnormal behaviours."
