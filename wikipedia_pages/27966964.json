The region is in the &lt;a href=\"Basin%20and%20Range%20Province\"&gt;Basin and Range&lt;/a&gt; and three mountain ranges are in a parallel, northwest-by-southeast-trending &lt;a href=\"thrust%20fault\"&gt;thrust&lt;/a&gt; belt, with two intervening valleys. The Little Harquahala Range borders the second valley and third mountain range, the &lt;a href=\"McMullen%20Valley\"&gt;McMullen Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harquahala%20Mountains\"&gt;Harquahala Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, on their southwest borders.\nThe range is a section of a &lt;a href=\"water%20divide\"&gt;water divide&lt;/a&gt; for tributaries to two river watersheds on the &lt;a href=\"Gila%20River\"&gt;Gila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20River\"&gt;Colorado River&lt;/a&gt;s. An even smaller range is connected north on the water divide, the 8-mile (13\u00a0km) long &lt;a href=\"Granite%20Wash%20Mountains\"&gt;Granite Wash Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaria fold and thrust belt.\nThe three mountain ranges and two valleys bordered to the northeast:\nPeaks and landforms.\nThe highest elevation in the mountains is Martin Peak at , in the southeast.
