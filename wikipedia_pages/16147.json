    "text": "Jewish holidays, also known as Jewish festivals or Yamim Tovim (, &lt;a href=\"Grammatical%20number\"&gt;or singular&lt;/a&gt; , in &lt;a href=\"Romanization%20of%20Hebrew\"&gt;transliterated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20language\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; []), are holidays observed in &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; throughout the &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20calendar\"&gt;Hebrew calendar&lt;/a&gt;. They include religious, cultural and national elements, derived from three sources: &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20Bible\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Mitzvah\"&gt;mitzvot&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"commandments\"), &lt;a href=\"Rabbinic%20Judaism\"&gt;rabbinic mandates&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20history\"&gt;history of Judaism&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Israel%23Independence%20and%20first%20years\"&gt;State of Israel&lt;/a&gt;.\nJewish holidays occur on the same dates every year in the Hebrew calendar, but the dates vary in the &lt;a href=\"Gregorian%20calendar\"&gt;Gregorian&lt;/a&gt;. This is because the Hebrew calendar is a &lt;a href=\"lunisolar%20calendar\"&gt;lunisolar calendar&lt;/a&gt; (based on the cycles of both the sun and moon), whereas the Gregorian is a &lt;a href=\"solar%20calendar\"&gt;solar calendar&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral concepts.\nGroupings.\nCertain terms are used very commonly for groups of holidays.\nTerminology used to describe holidays.\nCertain terminology is used in referring to different categories of holidays, depending on their source and their nature:\n\"&lt;a href=\"%23Shabbat%E2%80%94The%20Sabbath\"&gt;Shabbat&lt;/a&gt;\" (\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea) (&lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi\"&gt;Ashkenazi&lt;/a&gt; pron. from &lt;a href=\"Yiddish\"&gt;Yiddish&lt;/a&gt; \"shabbos\"), or Sabbath, is referred to by that name exclusively. Similarly, \"&lt;a href=\"%23Rosh%20Chodesh%E2%80%94The%20New%20Month\"&gt;Rosh Chodesh&lt;/a&gt;\" (\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9) is referred to by that name exclusively.\n\"Work\" on Sabbath and biblical holidays.\nThe most notable common feature of Shabbat and the biblical festivals is the requirement to refrain from \"melacha\" on these days. \"Melacha\" is most commonly translated as \"work\"; perhaps a better translation is \"creative-constructive work\". Strictly speaking, \"Melacha\" is defined in &lt;a href=\"halacha\"&gt;Jewish law \"(halacha)\"&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"melacha%23Definition\"&gt;39 categories of labor&lt;/a&gt; that were used in constructing the &lt;a href=\"Tabernacle\"&gt;Tabernacle&lt;/a&gt; while the Jews wandered in the desert. As understood traditionally and in &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20Judaism\"&gt;Orthodox Judaism&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn principle, &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Judaism\"&gt;Conservative Judaism&lt;/a&gt; understands the requirement to refrain from \"melacha\" in the same way as Orthodox Judaism. In practice, Conservative rabbis frequently rule on prohibitions around \"melacha\" differently from Orthodox authorities. Still, there are a number of Conservative/Masorti communities around the world where Sabbath and Festival observance fairly closely resembles Orthodox observance.\nHowever, many, if not most, lay members of Conservative congregations in North America do not consider themselves &lt;a href=\"Shomer%20Shabbat\"&gt;Sabbath-observant&lt;/a&gt;, even by Conservative standards. At the same time, adherents of &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Judaism\"&gt;Reform Judaism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reconstructionist%20Judaism\"&gt;Reconstructionist Judaism&lt;/a&gt; do not accept \"halacha\", and therefore restrictions on \"melacha,\" as binding at all. Jews fitting any of these descriptions refrain from \"melacha\" in practice only as they personally see fit.\nShabbat and holiday work restrictions are always put aside in cases of \"&lt;a href=\"pikuach%20nefesh\"&gt;pikuach nefesh&lt;/a&gt;,\" which is saving a human life. At the most fundamental level, if there is any possibility whatsoever that action must be taken to save a life, Shabbat restrictions are set aside immediately, and without reservation. Where the danger to life is present but less immediate, there is some preference to minimize violation of Shabbat work restrictions where possible. The laws in this area are complex.\nSecond day of biblical festivals.\nThe Torah specifies a single date on the Jewish calendar for observance of holidays. Nevertheless, festivals of biblical origin other than Shabbat and Yom Kippur are observed for two days outside the &lt;a href=\"land%20of%20Israel\"&gt;land of Israel&lt;/a&gt;, and Rosh Hashanah is observed for two days even inside the land of Israel.\nDates for holidays on the Jewish calendar are expressed in the Torah as \"day x of month y.\" Accordingly, the beginning of \"month y\" needs to be determined before the proper date of the holiday on \"day x\" can be fixed. Months in the Jewish calendar are &lt;a href=\"lunar%20month\"&gt;lunar&lt;/a&gt;, and originally were thought to have been proclaimed by the blowing of a \"&lt;a href=\"shofar\"&gt;shofar&lt;/a&gt;\". Later, the &lt;a href=\"Sanhedrin\"&gt;Sanhedrin&lt;/a&gt; received testimony of witnesses saying they saw the new crescent moon. Then the Sanhedrin would inform Jewish communities away from its meeting place that it had proclaimed a new moon. The practice of observing a second festival day stemmed from delays in disseminating that information.\nYom Kippur is not observed for two days anywhere because of the difficulty of maintaining a fast over two days.\nAdherents of &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Judaism\"&gt;Reform Judaism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reconstructionist%20Judaism\"&gt;Reconstructionist Judaism&lt;/a&gt; generally do not observe the second day of festivals, although some do observe two days of Rosh Hashanah.\nHolidays of biblical and rabbinic (Talmudic) origin.\nShabbat\u2014The Sabbath.\nJewish law \"(halacha)\" accords \"Shabbat\" (\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea) the status of a holiday, a day of rest celebrated on the seventh day of each week. Jewish law defines a day as ending at either sundown or nightfall, when the next day then begins. Thus,\nThe fundamental rituals and observances of Shabbat include:\nIn many ways, \"halakha\" (Jewish law) sees \"Shabbat\" as the most important holy day in the Jewish calendar.\nRosh Chodesh\u2014The New Month.\nRosh Chodesh (\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9) (lit., \"head of the month\") is a minor holiday or observance occurring on the first day of each month of the Jewish calendar, as well as the last day of the preceding month if it has thirty days.\nBeyond the preceding, current observance is limited to &lt;a href=\"Rosh%20Chodesh%23Traditional%20observances\"&gt;changes in liturgy&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Related observances:\"\nRosh Hashanah\u2014The Jewish New Year.\nSelichot.\nThe month of &lt;a href=\"Elul\"&gt;Elul&lt;/a&gt; that precedes Rosh Hashanah is considered to be a propitious time for &lt;a href=\"repentance\"&gt;repentance&lt;/a&gt;. For this reason, additional penitential prayers called &lt;a href=\"Selichot\"&gt;Selichot&lt;/a&gt; are added to the daily prayers, except on Shabbat. &lt;a href=\"Sephardi%20Jews\"&gt;Sephardi Jews&lt;/a&gt; add these prayers each weekday during Elul. &lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi%20Jews\"&gt;Ashkenazi Jews&lt;/a&gt; recite them from the last Sunday (or Saturday night) preceding Rosh Hashanah that allows at least four days of recitations.\nRosh Hashanah.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Oral%20Torah\"&gt;oral tradition&lt;/a&gt;, Rosh Hashanah (\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4) (lit., \"Head of the Year\") is the Day of Memorial or Remembrance (\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05d6\u05db\u05e8\u05d5\u05df, \"Yom HaZikaron\"), and the day of judgment (\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05d3\u05d9\u05df, \"Yom HaDin\"). God appears in the role of King, remembering and judging each person individually according to his/her deeds, and making a decree for each person for the following year.\nThe holiday is characterized by one specific &lt;a href=\"mitzvah\"&gt;mitzvah&lt;/a&gt;: blowing the \"&lt;a href=\"shofar\"&gt;shofar&lt;/a&gt;\". According to the Torah, this is the first day of the seventh month of the calendar year, and marks the beginning of a ten-day period leading up to Yom Kippur. According to one of two Talmudic opinions, the creation of the world was completed on Rosh Hashanah.\nMorning prayer services are lengthy on Rosh Hashanah, and focus on the themes described above: majesty and judgment, remembrance, the birth of the world, and the blowing of the \"shofar\". &lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi%20Jews\"&gt;Ashkenazi Jews&lt;/a&gt; recite the brief \"&lt;a href=\"Tashlikh\"&gt;Tashlikh&lt;/a&gt;\" prayer, a symbolic casting off of the previous year's sins, during the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah.\nThe Bible specifies Rosh Hashanah as a one-day holiday, but it is traditionally celebrated for two days, even within the &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20Israel\"&gt;Land of Israel&lt;/a&gt;. (See \"&lt;a href=\"%232days\"&gt;Second day of biblical festivals&lt;/a&gt;,\" above.)\nFour New Years.\nThe Torah itself does not use any term like \"New Year\" in reference to Rosh Hashanah. The &lt;a href=\"Mishnah\"&gt;Mishnah&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rosh%20Hashanah%20%28tractate%29\"&gt;Rosh Hashanah&lt;/a&gt; specifies four different \"New Year's Days\" for different purposes:\nAseret Yemei Teshuva\u2014Ten Days of Repentance.\nThe first ten days of Tishrei (from the beginning of Rosh Hashana until the end of Yom Kippur) are known as the Ten Days of Repentance (\u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05ea \u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4, \"Aseret Yemei Teshuva\"). During this time, in anticipation of Yom Kippur, it is \"exceedingly appropriate\" for Jews to practice \"&lt;a href=\"teshuvah\"&gt;teshuvah&lt;/a&gt;\" (literally \"return\"), an examination of one's deeds and repentance for sins one has committed against other people and God. This repentance can take the form of additional supplications, confessing one's deeds before God, fasting, self-reflection, and an increase of involvement with, or donations to, &lt;a href=\"tzedakah\"&gt;charity&lt;/a&gt;.\nTzom Gedalia\u2014Fast of Gedalia.\nThe Fast of Gedalia (\u05e6\u05d5\u05dd \u05d2\u05d3\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4) is a minor Jewish fast day. It commemorates the assassination of the governor of Judah, &lt;a href=\"Gedalia\"&gt;Gedalia&lt;/a&gt;, which ended any level of Jewish rule following the destruction of the First Temple.\nAs on all minor fast days, fasting from dawn to dusk is required, but other laws of mourning are not normally observed. A Torah reading is included in both the \"Shacharit\" and \"Mincha\" prayers, and a Haftarah is also included at \"Mincha\". There are also a number of additions to the liturgy of both services.\nYom Kippur\u2014Day of Atonement.\nYom Kippur (\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05db\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8) is the holiest day of the year for Jews. Its central theme is &lt;a href=\"Atonement%20in%20Judaism\"&gt;atonement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3Areconciliation\"&gt;reconciliation&lt;/a&gt;. This is accomplished through prayer and complete fasting\u2014including abstinence from all food and drink (including water)\u2014by all healthy adults. Bathing, wearing of perfume or cologne, wearing of leather shoes, and sexual relations are some of the other prohibitions on Yom Kippur\u2014all them designed to ensure one's attention is completely and absolutely focused on the quest for atonement with God. Yom Kippur is also unique among holidays as having &lt;a href=\"%23work\"&gt;work-related restrictions&lt;/a&gt; identical to those of Shabbat. The fast and other prohibitions commence on 10 Tishrei at sunset\u2014sunset being the \"beginning\" of the day in Jewish tradition.\nA traditional prayer in &lt;a href=\"Aramaic%20language\"&gt;Aramaic&lt;/a&gt; called \"&lt;a href=\"Kol%20Nidre\"&gt;Kol Nidre&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"All Vows\") is traditionally recited just before sunset. Although often regarded as the start of the Yom Kippur evening service\u2014to such a degree that \"Erev Yom Kippur\" (\"Yom Kippur Evening\") is often called \"Kol Nidre\" (also spelled \"Kol Nidrei\")\u2014it is technically a separate tradition. This is especially so because, being recited before sunset, it is actually recited on 9 Tishrei, which is the day \"before\" Yom Kippur; it is not recited on Yom Kippur itself (on 10 Tishrei, which begins \"after\" the sun sets).\nA \"&lt;a href=\"Tallit\"&gt;Tallit&lt;/a&gt;\" (four-cornered &lt;a href=\"prayer\"&gt;prayer&lt;/a&gt; shawl) is donned for evening and afternoon prayers\u2013the only day of the year in which this is done. In traditional Ashkenazi communities, men wear the \"&lt;a href=\"kittel\"&gt;kittel&lt;/a&gt;\" throughout the day's prayers. The prayers on Yom Kippur evening are lengthier than on any other night of the year. Once services reconvene in the morning, the services (in all traditions) are the longest of the year. In some traditional synagogues prayers run continuously from morning until nightfall, or nearly so. Two highlights of the morning prayers in traditional synagogues are the recitation of \"&lt;a href=\"Yizkor\"&gt;Yizkor&lt;/a&gt;,\" the prayer of remembrance, and of liturgical poems \"(&lt;a href=\"piyyutim\"&gt;piyyutim&lt;/a&gt;)\" describing the &lt;a href=\"Yom%20Kippur%23Temple%20service\"&gt;temple service of Yom Kippur&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo other highlights happen late in the day. During the \"&lt;a href=\"Minchah\"&gt;Minchah&lt;/a&gt;\" prayer, the \"&lt;a href=\"haftarah\"&gt;haftarah&lt;/a&gt;\" reading features the entire &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Jonah\"&gt;Book of Jonah&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the day concludes with \"&lt;a href=\"Ne%27ilah\"&gt;Ne'ilah&lt;/a&gt;,\" a special service recited only on the day of Yom Kippur. Ne'ilah deals with the closing of the holiday, and contains a fervent final plea to God for forgiveness just before the conclusion of the fast. Yom Kippur comes to an end with the blowing of the \"&lt;a href=\"shofar\"&gt;shofar&lt;/a&gt;\", which marks the conclusion of the fast. It is always observed as a one-day holiday, both inside and outside the boundaries of the &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20Israel\"&gt;Land of Israel&lt;/a&gt;.\nYom Kippur is considered, along with 15th of Av, as the happiest days of the year (Talmud Bavli\u2014Tractate Ta'anit).\nSukkot\u2014Feast of Booths (or Tabernacles).\n\"Sukkot\" (\u05e1\u05d5\u05db\u05d5\u05ea or \u05e1\u05bb\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea, \"sukk\u014dt\") or \"Succoth\" is a seven-day &lt;a href=\"religious%20festival\"&gt;festival&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Feast of Booths, the Feast of Tabernacles, or just Tabernacles. It is one of the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Pilgrimage%20Festivals\"&gt;Three Pilgrimage Festivals&lt;/a&gt; (\"shalosh regalim\") mentioned in the Bible. Sukkot commemorates the years that the Jews spent in the desert on their way to the Promised Land, and celebrates the way in which God protected them under difficult desert conditions. The word \"sukkot\" is the plural of the &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20language\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; word \"sukkah\", meaning booth. Jews are commanded to \"dwell\" in booths during the holiday. This generally means taking meals, but some sleep in the \"sukkah\" as well, particularly in Israel. There are specific &lt;a href=\"Sukkah%23Structure\"&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; for constructing a \"sukkah\".\nAlong with dwelling in a \"sukkah,\" the principal ritual unique to this holiday is use of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Species\"&gt;Four Species&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"lulav\"&gt;\"lulav\" (palm)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hadass\"&gt;\"hadass\" (myrtle)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aravah%20%28Sukkot%29\"&gt;\"aravah\" (willow)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"etrog\"&gt;\"etrog\" (citron)&lt;/a&gt;. On each day of the holiday other than Shabbat, these are waved in association with the recitation of &lt;a href=\"Hallel\"&gt;Hallel&lt;/a&gt; in the synagogue, then walked in a procession around the synagogue called the &lt;a href=\"Sukkot%23Hoshanot\"&gt;\"Hoshanot\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe seventh day of the Sukkot is called &lt;a href=\"Hoshanah%20Rabbah\"&gt;Hoshanah Rabbah&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Great \"Hoshanah\"\" (singular of \"Hoshanot\" and the source of the English word &lt;a href=\"hosanna\"&gt;hosanna&lt;/a&gt;). The climax of the day's prayers includes seven processions of \"Hoshanot\" around the synagogue. This tradition mimics practices from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20in%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Temple in Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. Many aspects of the day's customs also resemble those of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Hoshanah Rabbah is traditionally taken to be the day of the \"delivery\" of the final judgment of Yom Kippur, and offers a &lt;a href=\"Hoshanah%20Rabbah%23Final%20judgment\"&gt;last opportunity for pleas of repentance&lt;/a&gt; before the holiday season closes.\nShemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah.\nThe holiday of Shemini Atzeret (\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e2\u05e6\u05e8\u05ea) immediately follows the conclusion of the holiday of Sukkot. The Hebrew word \"shemini\" means \"eighth\u201d, and refers to its position on \"the eighth day\" of Sukkot, actually a seven-day holiday. This name reflects the fact that while in many respects Shemini Atzeret is a separate holiday in its own right, in certain respects its celebration is &lt;a href=\"Shemini%20Atzeret%23Relationship%20to%20Sukkot\"&gt;linked to that of Sukkot&lt;/a&gt;. Outside Israel, meals are still taken in the Sukkah on this day.\nThe main notable custom of this holiday is the celebration of \"Simchat Torah\" (\u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u05ea \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4), meaning \"rejoicing with the Torah\". This name originally referred to a special \"ceremony\": the last &lt;a href=\"weekly%20Torah%20portion\"&gt;weekly Torah portion&lt;/a&gt; is read from &lt;a href=\"Deuteronomy\"&gt;Deuteronomy&lt;/a&gt;, completing the annual cycle, and is followed immediately by the reading of the first chapter of &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Genesis\"&gt;Genesis&lt;/a&gt;, beginning the new annual cycle. Services are especially joyous, and all attendees, young and old, are involved.\nThis ceremony so dominates the holiday that in Israel, where the holiday is one day long, the whole holiday is often referred to as \"Simchat Torah\". Outside Israel, the holiday is two days long; the name \"Shemini Atzeret\" is used for the first day, while the second is normally called \"Simchat Torah\".\nHanukkah\u2014Festival of Lights.\nThe story of Hanukkah (\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u05db\u05d4) is preserved in the books of the &lt;a href=\"1%20Maccabees\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2%20Maccabees\"&gt;Second Maccabees&lt;/a&gt;. These books are not part of the &lt;a href=\"Tanakh\"&gt;Tanakh&lt;/a&gt; (Hebrew Bible), they are &lt;a href=\"Biblical%20apocrypha\"&gt;apocryphal&lt;/a&gt; books instead. The miracle of the one-day supply of &lt;a href=\"olive%20oil\"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt; miraculously lasting eight days is first described in the &lt;a href=\"Talmud\"&gt;Talmud&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shabbat%20%28Talmud%29\"&gt;(Shabbat 21b)&lt;/a&gt;, written about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.\nHanukkah marks the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Seleucid%20Empire\"&gt;Seleucid Empire&lt;/a&gt; forces that had tried to prevent the people of &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; from practicing Judaism. &lt;a href=\"Judas%20Maccabeus\"&gt;Judah Maccabee&lt;/a&gt; and his brothers destroyed overwhelming forces, and rededicated the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20in%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Temple in Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. The eight-day festival is marked by the kindling of lights\u2014one on the first night, two on the second, and so on\u2014using a special candle holder called a \"&lt;a href=\"Hanukkiah\"&gt;Hanukkiah&lt;/a&gt;\", or a \"Hanukkah menorah.\"\nReligiously, Hanukkah is a minor holiday. Except on Shabbat, restrictions on work do not apply. Aside from the kindling of lights, formal religious observance is restricted to &lt;a href=\"Hanukkah%23Special%20additions%20to%20daily%20prayers\"&gt;changes in liturgy&lt;/a&gt;. Hanukkah celebration tends to be informal and based on custom rather than law. Three widely practiced customs include:\nTenth of Tevet.\nThe Tenth of Tevet (\u05e2\u05e9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d8\u05d1\u05ea, \"Asarah B'Tevet\") is a minor fast day, marking the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem as outlined in &lt;a href=\"2%20Kings\"&gt;2 Kings&lt;/a&gt; 25:1\nThis fast's commemoration also includes &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20of%20Tevet%23History\"&gt;other events&lt;/a&gt; occurring on 8, 9 and 10 Tevet.\nThis fast is observed like other minor fasts (see &lt;a href=\"%23Tzom%20Gedalia%E2%80%94Fast%20of%20Gedalia\"&gt;Tzom Gedalia&lt;/a&gt;, above). This is the only minor fast that can fall on a Friday under the current fixed &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20calendar\"&gt;Jewish calendar&lt;/a&gt;.\nTu Bishvat\u2014New Year of the Trees.\nTu Bishvat (\u05d8\"\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e9\u05d1\u05d8) (lit., \"fifteenth of Shevat\u201d, as \u05d8\u05f4\u05d5 is the number \"15\" in Hebrew letters), is the new year for trees. It is also known as \u05d7\u05d2 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d9\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea (\"\u1e24ag ha-Ilanot,\" Festival of Trees), or \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d9\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea (\"Rosh ha-Shanah la-Ilanot,\" New Year for Trees). According to the &lt;a href=\"Mishnah\"&gt;Mishnah&lt;/a&gt;, it marks the day from which fruit &lt;a href=\"tithe\"&gt;tithe&lt;/a&gt;s are counted each year. Starting on this date, the biblical prohibition on eating the first three years of fruit (\"&lt;a href=\"Orlah%20prohibition\"&gt;orlah&lt;/a&gt;\") and the requirement to bring the fourth year fruit \"(neta revai)\" to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20in%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Temple in Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; were counted.\nDuring the 17th century, Rabbi &lt;a href=\"Yitzchak%20Luria\"&gt;Yitzchak Luria&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Safed\"&gt;Safed&lt;/a&gt; and his disciples created a short seder, called \"Hemdat ha\u2011Yamim,\" reminiscent of the seder that Jews observe on &lt;a href=\"Passover\"&gt;Passover&lt;/a&gt;, that explores the holiday's &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Kabbalah\"&gt;Kabbalistic&lt;/a&gt; themes. This &lt;a href=\"Tu%20Bishvat%20seder\"&gt;Tu Bishvat seder&lt;/a&gt; has witnessed a revival in recent years. More generally, Tu Bishvat is celebrated in modern times by eating various fruits and nuts associated with the &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20Israel\"&gt;Land of Israel&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraditionally, trees are planted on this day. Many children collect funds leading up to this day to plant trees in Israel. Trees are usually planted locally as well.\nPurim\u2014Festival of Lots.\nPurim Katan.\n\"Purim Katan\" (\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05e7\u05d8\u05df) (lit., \"small Purim\") is observed on the 14th and 15th of First Adar in leap years. These days are marked by a small increase in festivity, including a prohibition on fasting, and slight changes in the liturgy.\nTa'anit Esther\u2013Fast of Esther.\n\"Ta'anit Esther\" (\u05ea\u05e2\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea \u05d0\u05e1\u05ea\u05e8), or \"Fast of Esther\", is named in honor of the fast of &lt;a href=\"Esther\"&gt;Esther&lt;/a&gt; and her court as Esther prepared to approach the king unbidden to invite him and &lt;a href=\"Haman%20%28Bible%29\"&gt;Haman&lt;/a&gt; to a banquet. It commemorates that fast, as well as one alluded to later in the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Esther\"&gt;Book of Esther&lt;/a&gt;, undertaken as the Jews prepared to battle their enemies.\nThis fast is observed like other minor fasts (see &lt;a href=\"%23Tzom%20Gedalia\"&gt;Tzom Gedalia&lt;/a&gt;, above). While normally observed on 13 Adar, the eve of Purim, this fast is advanced to Thursday, 11 Adar, when 13 Adar falls on Shabbat.\nPurim and Shushan Purim.\nPurim (\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd) commemorates the events that took place in the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Esther\"&gt;Book of Esther&lt;/a&gt;. The principal celebrations or commemorations include:\nSeveral customs have evolved from these principal commemorations. One widespread custom to act out the story of Purim. The &lt;a href=\"Purim%20spiel\"&gt;Purim spiel&lt;/a&gt;, or Purim play, has its origins in this, although the \"Purim spiel\" is not limited to that subject. Wearing of costumes and masks is also very common. These may be an outgrowth of Purim plays, but there are several theories as to the origin of the custom, most related in some way to the \"hidden\" nature of the miracles of Purim.\nPurim carnivals of various types have also become customary. In Israel there are festive parades, known as \"Ad-D'lo-Yada\", in the town's main street. The largest and most renowned is in &lt;a href=\"Holon\"&gt;Holon&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost Jews celebrate Purim on 14 Adar, the day of celebration after the Jews defeated their enemies. Because Jews in the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Shushan\"&gt;Shushan&lt;/a&gt; fought with their enemies an extra day, Purim is celebrated a day later there, on the day known as \u05e9\u05d5\u05e9\u05df \u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, &lt;a href=\"Purim%23Sushan%20Purim\"&gt;Shushan Purim&lt;/a&gt;. This observance was expanded to \"walled cities\", which are defined as cities \"walled since the time of &lt;a href=\"Joshua\"&gt;Joshua&lt;/a&gt;\". In practice, there are no Jews living in Shushan (&lt;a href=\"Shush%2C%20Iran\"&gt;Shush, Iran&lt;/a&gt;), and Shushan Purim is observed fully only in &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. Cities like &lt;a href=\"Safed\"&gt;Safed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tiberias\"&gt;Tiberias&lt;/a&gt; also partially observe Shushan Purim. Elsewhere, Shushan Purim is marked only by a small increase in festivity, including a prohibition on fasting, and slight changes in the liturgy.\nPesach\u2014Passover.\nMonth of Nisan.\nAs a rule, the month of Nisan is considered to be one of extra joy. Traditionally, throughout the entire month, &lt;a href=\"Tahanun\"&gt;Tahanun&lt;/a&gt; is omitted from the prayer service, many public mourning practices (such as delivering a &lt;a href=\"hesped\"&gt;eulogy&lt;/a&gt; at a funeral) are eliminated, and voluntary &lt;a href=\"fasting%23Judaism\"&gt;fasting&lt;/a&gt; is prohibited. However, practices sometimes vary.\nEve of Passover and Fast of the Firstborn.\nThe day before Passover (\"Erev Pesach,\" lit., \"Passover eve\") is significant for three reasons:\nWhen Passover starts on Sunday, and the eve of Passover is therefore Shabbat, the above schedule is altered. See &lt;a href=\"Eve%20of%20Passover%20on%20Shabbat\"&gt;Eve of Passover on Shabbat&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nPassover.\nPassover (\u05e4\u05bc\u05e1\u05d7) \"(Pesach\"), also known liturgically as \u05d7\u05d2 \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea \"(\"\u1e24ag haMatzot\"\", the \"Festival of Unleavened Bread\"), is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (\"shalosh regalim\") mentioned in the Torah. Passover commemorates &lt;a href=\"the%20Exodus\"&gt;the Exodus&lt;/a&gt;, the liberation of the Israelite slaves from Egypt. No \"&lt;a href=\"chametz\"&gt;chametz&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Leavening%20agent\"&gt;leavened&lt;/a&gt; food) is eaten, or even owned, during the week of Passover, in commemoration of the biblical narrative in which the Israelites left Egypt so quickly that their bread did not have enough time to rise. Observant Jews go to great lengths to remove all \"chametz\" from their homes and offices in the run-up to Passover.\nAlong with the avoidance of \"chametz\", the principal ritual unique to this holiday is the &lt;a href=\"seder\"&gt;seder&lt;/a&gt;. The \"seder\", meaning \"order\", is an ordered ritual meal eaten on the first night of Passover, and outside Israel also on the &lt;a href=\"%232days\"&gt;second night&lt;/a&gt;. This meal is known for its distinctive ritual foods\u2014&lt;a href=\"matzo\"&gt;matzo&lt;/a&gt; (unleavened bread), &lt;a href=\"maror\"&gt;maror&lt;/a&gt; (bitter herbs), and four cups of &lt;a href=\"kosher%20wine\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt;\u2014as well as its prayer text/handbook/study guide, the &lt;a href=\"Haggadah\"&gt;Haggadah&lt;/a&gt;. Participation in a Passover seder is one of the most widely observed Jewish rituals, even among less affiliated or less observant Jews.\nPassover lasts seven days in Israel, and eight days outside Israel. The holiday of the last day of Passover (outside Israel, last &lt;a href=\"%232days\"&gt;two days&lt;/a&gt;) commemorates the &lt;a href=\"Splitting%20of%20the%20Red%20Sea\"&gt;Splitting of the Red Sea&lt;/a&gt;; according to tradition this occurred on the &lt;a href=\"Passover%23Seventh%20day%20of%20Passover\"&gt;seventh day of Passover&lt;/a&gt;.\nPesach Sheni.\n\"Pesach Sheni\" (\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9) (\"Second Passover\") is a day prescribed in the Torah to allow those who did not bring the Paschal Lamb offering \"(Korban Pesach)\" a second chance to do so. Eligibility was limited to those who were distant from Jerusalem on Passover, or those who were ritually impure and ineligible to participate in a sacrificial offering. Today, some have the custom to eat matzo on Pesach Sheni, and some make a small change to the liturgy.\nSefirah\u2014Counting of the Omer.\n\"Sefirah\" (lit. \"Counting\"; more fully, \"Sefirat HaOmer,\" \"Counting of the Omer\") (\u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05de\u05e8), is the 49-day period between the biblical pilgrimage festivals of Passover and Shavuot. The Torah states that this period is to be counted, both in days and in weeks. The first day of this period is the day of the first &lt;a href=\"grain%20offering\"&gt;grain offering&lt;/a&gt; of the new year's crop, an &lt;a href=\"omer%20%28unit%29\"&gt;omer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"barley\"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt;. The day following the 49th day of the period is the festival of Shavuot; the Torah specifies a grain offering of &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; on that day.\nSymbolically, this period has come to represent the spiritual development of the Israelites from slaves in the &lt;a href=\"polytheistic\"&gt;polytheistic&lt;/a&gt; society of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;Ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt; to free, &lt;a href=\"monotheistic\"&gt;monotheistic&lt;/a&gt; people worthy of the &lt;a href=\"revelation%23Judaism\"&gt;revelation&lt;/a&gt; of the Torah, traditionally said to have occurred on &lt;a href=\"Shavuot%23Giving%20of%20the%20Torah\"&gt;Shavuot&lt;/a&gt;. Spiritual development remains a key rabbinic teaching of this period.\nSefirah has long been observed as a period of semi-mourning. The customary explanation cites a plague that killed 24,000 students of &lt;a href=\"Rabbi%20Akiva\"&gt;Rabbi Akiva&lt;/a&gt; (BT \"&lt;a href=\"Yevamot\"&gt;Yevamot&lt;/a&gt;\" 62b). In broad terms, the mourning practices observed include limiting actual celebrations (such as weddings), not listening to music, not wearing new clothing, and not shaving or taking a haircut. There is a wide variety of practice as to the specifics of this observance. See &lt;a href=\"Counting%20of%20the%20Omer%23As%20a%20period%20of%20semi-mourning\"&gt;Counting of the Omer (Semi-mourning)&lt;/a&gt;.\nLag Ba'Omer.\n\"Lag Ba'Omer\" () is the 33rd day in the Omer count ( is the number 33 in Hebrew). By Ashkenazi practice, the semi-mourning observed during the period of Sefirah (see above) is lifted \"on\" Lag Ba'Omer, while Sefardi practice is to lift it \"at the end of\" Lag Ba'Omer. Minor liturgical changes are made on Lag Ba'omer; because mourning practices are suspended, weddings are often conducted on this day.\nLag Ba'Omer is identified as the \"&lt;a href=\"Yom%20Hillula\"&gt;Yom Hillula&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"yahrzeit\"&gt;yahrzeit&lt;/a&gt;)\" of &lt;a href=\"Rabbi%20Shimon%20bar%20Yochai\"&gt;Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading \"&lt;a href=\"Tannaim\"&gt;Tannaim&lt;/a&gt;\" (teachers quoted in the Mishna) and ascribed author of the core text of &lt;a href=\"Kabbalah\"&gt;Kabbalah&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zohar\"&gt;Zohar&lt;/a&gt;. Customary celebrations include bonfires, &lt;a href=\"picnic\"&gt;picnic&lt;/a&gt;s, and bow and arrow play by children. Boys sometimes receive their first haircuts on Lag Ba'Omer, while Hasidic rebbes hold \"&lt;a href=\"Tish%20%28Hasidic%20celebration%29\"&gt;tish&lt;/a&gt;es\" in honor of the day.\nIn Israel, Lag Ba'Omer is associated with the &lt;a href=\"Bar%20Kokhba%20revolt\"&gt;Bar Kokhba revolt&lt;/a&gt; against the Roman Empire. In Zionist thought, the plague that decimated Rabbi Akiva's 24,000 disciples is explained as a veiled reference to the revolt; the 33rd day representing the end of the plague is explained as the day of Bar Kokhba's victory. The traditional bonfires and bow-and-arrow play were thus reinterpreted as celebrations of military victory. In this vein, the order originally creating the &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Defense%20Forces\"&gt;Israel Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt; was issued on Lag Ba'Omer 1948, 13 days after Israel declared independence.\nShavuot\u2014Feast of Weeks\u2014Yom HaBikurim.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Shavuot\"&gt;Shavuot&lt;/a&gt;\" (), the Feast of Weeks, is one of the three pilgrimage festivals (\"Shalosh regalim\") ordained in the Torah. Different from other biblical holidays, the date for Shavuot is not explicitly fixed in the Torah. Instead, it is observed on the day following the 49th and final day in the &lt;a href=\"%23Sefirah%E2%80%94Counting%20of%20the%20Omer\"&gt;counting of the Omer&lt;/a&gt;. In the current era of the fixed &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20calendar\"&gt;Jewish calendar&lt;/a&gt;, this puts the date of Shavuot as 6 Sivan. In Israel and in Reform Judaism, it is a one-day holiday; elsewhere, it is a two-day holiday extending through 7 Sivan.\nAccording to Rabbinic tradition, codified in the Talmud at &lt;a href=\"Shabbat%20%28Talmud%29\"&gt;Shabbat 87b&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ten%20Commandments\"&gt;Ten Commandments&lt;/a&gt; were given on this day. In the era of the Temple, there were certain specific &lt;a href=\"Korban\"&gt;offerings&lt;/a&gt; mandated for Shavuot, and Shavuot was the first day for bringing of &lt;a href=\"Bikkurim%20%28First-fruits%29\"&gt;Bikkurim&lt;/a&gt; to the Temple. Other than those, there are no explicit \"mitzvot\" unique to Shavuot given in the Torah (parallel to matzo on Passover or Sukkah on Sukkot).\nNevertheless, there are a number of widespread customs observed on Shavuot. During this holiday the &lt;a href=\"Torah\"&gt;Torah&lt;/a&gt; portion containing the Ten Commandments is read in the synagogue, and the biblical &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Ruth\"&gt;Book of Ruth&lt;/a&gt; is read as well. It is traditional to eat dairy meals during Shavuot. In observant circles, &lt;a href=\"Shavuot%23All-night%20Torah%20study\"&gt;all night Torah study&lt;/a&gt; is common on the first night of Shavuot, while in Reform Judaism, Shavuot is the customary date for &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Judaism%23Confirmation%20ceremonies\"&gt;Confirmation ceremonies&lt;/a&gt;.\nMourning for Jerusalem: Seventeenth of Tammuz and Tisha B'Av.\nThe three-week period starting on 17 Tammuz and concluding after Tisha B'Av has traditionally been observed as a period of mourning for the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Temple\"&gt;Holy Temple&lt;/a&gt; there.\nFast of the Seventeenth of Tammuz.\nThe Seventeenth of Tamuz (\u05e9\u05d1\u05e2\u05d4 \u05e2\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d1\u05ea\u05de\u05d5\u05d6, \"Shiva Asar B'Tamuz\") traditionally marks the first breach in the walls of the Jerusalem during the Roman conquest in 70 CE, at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Temple\"&gt;Second Temple&lt;/a&gt; period. According to tradition, this day has had negative connotations since Moses broke the first set of tablets on this day. The Mishnah cites five negative events that happened on 17 Tammuz.\nThis fast is observed like other minor fasts (see &lt;a href=\"%23Tzom%20Gedalia\"&gt;Tzom Gedalia&lt;/a&gt;, above). When this fast falls out on Shabbat, its observance is postponed until Sunday.\nThe Three Weeks and the Nine Days.\nThe period between the fasts of 17 Tammuz and 9 Av, known as the \"Three Weeks\" (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, \"between the straits\"), features a steadily increasing level of mourning practices as Tisha B'Av approaches. Ashkenazi Jews refrain from conducting weddings and other joyful events throughout the period unless the date is established by Jewish law (as for a &lt;a href=\"bris\"&gt;bris&lt;/a&gt; or \"&lt;a href=\"pidyon%20haben\"&gt;pidyon haben&lt;/a&gt;)\". They do not cut their hair during this period. Starting on the first of Av and throughout the nine days between the 1st and 9th days of Av, Ashkenazim traditionally refrain from eating &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt; and drinking &lt;a href=\"wine\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt;, except on Shabbat or at a \"Seudat Mitzvah\" (a &lt;a href=\"Mitzvah\"&gt;Mitzvah&lt;/a&gt; meal, such as for a bris or \"&lt;a href=\"siyum\"&gt;siyum&lt;/a&gt;\"). They also refrain from bathing for pleasure. Sefardic practice varies some from this; the less severe restrictions usually begin on 1 Av, while the more severe restrictions apply during the week of Tisha B'Av itself.\nSubject to the variations described above, &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20Judaism\"&gt;Orthodox Judaism&lt;/a&gt; continues to maintain the traditional prohibitions. In &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Judaism\"&gt;Conservative Judaism&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rabbinical%20Assembly\"&gt;Rabbinical Assembly&lt;/a&gt;'s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has issued several &lt;a href=\"halakha\"&gt;responsa (legal rulings)&lt;/a&gt; which hold that the prohibitions against weddings in this timeframe are deeply held traditions, but should not be construed as binding law. Thus, Conservative Jewish practice would allow weddings during this time, except on the 17th of Tammuz and 9th of Av themselves. Rabbis within &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Judaism\"&gt;Reform Judaism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reconstructionist%20Judaism\"&gt;Reconstructionist Judaism&lt;/a&gt; hold that halakha (Jewish law) is no longer binding and follow their individual consciences on such matters. Nevertheless, the rabbinical manual of the Reform movement encourages Reform rabbis not to conduct weddings on Tisha B'Av itself \"out of historical consciousness and respect\" for the Jewish community.\nTisha B'Av\u2014Ninth of Av.\n\"Tisha B'Av\" () is a major fast day and day of mourning. A Midrashic tradition states that the spies' negative report concerning the Land of Israel was delivered on Tisha B'Av. Consequently, the day became auspicious for negative events in Jewish history. Most notably, both the &lt;a href=\"Solomon%27s%20Temple\"&gt;First Temple&lt;/a&gt;, originally built by King &lt;a href=\"Solomon\"&gt;Solomon&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Temple\"&gt;Second Temple&lt;/a&gt; of Roman times were destroyed on Tisha B'Av. Other calamities throughout Jewish history are said to have taken place on Tisha B'Av, including King &lt;a href=\"Edward%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward I&lt;/a&gt;'s edict compelling the Jews to leave England (1290) and the &lt;a href=\"Alhambra%20Decree\"&gt;Jewish expulsion&lt;/a&gt; from Spain in 1492.\nTisha B'Av is a major fast. It is a 25-hour fast, running from sundown to nightfall. As on Yom Kippur, not only are eating and drinking prohibited, but also bathing, anointing, marital relations and the wearing of leather shoes. Work is not prohibited, as on biblical holidays, but is discouraged. In the evening, the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Lamentations\"&gt;Book of Lamentations&lt;/a&gt; is read in the synagogue, while in the morning lengthy \"&lt;a href=\"kinot\"&gt;kinot&lt;/a&gt;,\" poems of elegy, are recited. From evening until noon mourning rituals resembling those of &lt;a href=\"Shiva%20%28Judaism%29\"&gt;shiva&lt;/a&gt; are observed, including sitting on low stools or the floor; after noon those restrictions are somewhat lightened, in keeping with the tradition that Messiah will be born on Tisha B'Av.\nWhile the fast ends at nightfall of 9-10 Av, the restrictions of the Three Weeks and Nine Days continue through noon on 10 Av because the Second Temple continued to burn through most of that day. When 9 Av falls on Shabbat, when fasting is prohibited, the fast is postponed until 10 Av. In that case, the restrictions of the Three Weeks and Nine Days end with the fast, except for the prohibition against eating meat and drinking wine, which extend until the morning of 10 Av.\nTu B'Av.\n\"Tu B'av\" (\u05d8\u05f4\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d1), lit. \"15th of Av\", is a day mentioned in the Talmud alongside Yom Kippur as \"happiest of the year\". It was a day celebrating the bringing of wood used for the Temple Service, as well as a day when marriages were arranged. Today, it is marked by a small change in liturgy. In modern Israel, the day has become somewhat of an analog to &lt;a href=\"Valentine%27s%20Day\"&gt;Valentine's Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther fasts.\nSeveral other fast days of ancient or medieval origin continue to be observed to some degree in modern times. Such continued observance is usually by Orthodox Jews only, and is not universal today even among Orthodox Jews.\nIsraeli/Jewish national holidays and days of remembrance.\nAs a general rule, the biblical Jewish holidays (Sabbath, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Passover, Shavuot, Sukkot and Purim) are observed as public holidays in Israel. Chanukah is a school holiday, but businesses remain open. On Tisha B'Av, restaurants and places of entertainment are closed. Other Jewish holidays listed above are observed in varying ways and to varying degrees.\nBetween the creation of the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Israel\"&gt;State of Israel&lt;/a&gt; in 1948 and the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Six-Day%20War\"&gt;Six-Day War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knesset\"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt;, generally in consultation with the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Rabbinate%20of%20Israel\"&gt;Chief Rabbinate of Israel&lt;/a&gt;, established four national holidays or days of remembrance:\nThe status of these days as \"religious\" events is not uniform within the Jewish world. Non-Orthodox, &lt;a href=\"Religious%20Zionist\"&gt;Religious Zionist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Modern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Modern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20religious%20movements\"&gt;Jewish religious movements&lt;/a&gt; accept these days as \"religious\" as well as \"national\" in nature.\nAs a rule, these four days are not accepted as religious observances by most &lt;a href=\"Haredi%20Jews\"&gt;Haredi Jews&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Hasidim\"&gt;Hasidim&lt;/a&gt;. Some \"\u1e25aredim\" are opposed to the existence of the State of Israel altogether on religious grounds; others simply feel that there are not sufficient grounds under Jewish law to justify the establishment of new religious holidays. For details, see &lt;a href=\"Haredim%20and%20Zionism\"&gt;Haredim and Zionism&lt;/a&gt;.\nObservance of these days in &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20diaspora\"&gt;Jewish communities outside Israel&lt;/a&gt; is typically more muted than their observance in Israel. Events held in government and public venues within Israel are often held in Jewish communal settings (synagogues and community centers) abroad.\nMore recently, the Knesset established two additional holidays:\nFinally, the Israeli government also recognizes several &lt;a href=\"%23Ethnic%20holidays\"&gt;ethnic Jewish observances&lt;/a&gt; with holiday status.\nYom HaShoah\u2014Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\"Yom HaShoah\" (lit. \"Holocaust Day\") is a day of remembrance for victims of the &lt;a href=\"Holocaust\"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;. Its full name is \"Yom Hazikaron LaShoah v'LiGevurah\" (lit. \"Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day\") (), and reflects a desire to recognize martyrs who died in active &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20resistance%20under%20Nazi%20rule\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazis&lt;/a&gt; alongside those who died as passive victims. Its date, 27 Nisan, was chosen because it commemorates the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Ghetto%20uprising\"&gt;Warsaw Ghetto uprising&lt;/a&gt;, the best known of the armed Jewish uprisings.\nPlaces of public entertainment are closed throughout Israel in recognition of the day. Public &lt;a href=\"Yom%20HaShoah%23Commemoration\"&gt;commemoration&lt;/a&gt; of Yom HaShoah usually includes religious elements such as the recitation of &lt;a href=\"Psalms\"&gt;Psalms&lt;/a&gt;, memorial prayers, and &lt;a href=\"kaddish\"&gt;kaddish&lt;/a&gt;, and the lighting of &lt;a href=\"memorial%20candle\"&gt;memorial candle&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Yom%20HaShoah%23In%20Israel\"&gt;In Israel&lt;/a&gt;, the most notable observances are the State memorial ceremony at &lt;a href=\"Yad%20Vashem\"&gt;Yad Vashem&lt;/a&gt; and the sirens marking off a two-minute silence at 10:00 am. Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox Jews generally participate in such public observances along with secular Jews and Jews who adhere to more liberal religious movements. &lt;a href=\"Yom%20HaShoah%23Abroad\"&gt;Outside Israel&lt;/a&gt;, Jewish communities observe Yom HaShoah in addition to or instead of their countries' &lt;a href=\"Holocaust%20Memorial%20Days\"&gt;Holocaust Memorial Days&lt;/a&gt;. Probably the most notable commemoration is the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20the%20Living\"&gt;March of the Living&lt;/a&gt;, held at the site of &lt;a href=\"Auschwitz-Birkenau\"&gt;Auschwitz-Birkenau&lt;/a&gt;, attended by Jews from all parts of the world.\nOutside Orthodoxy, a liturgy for Yom HaShoah is beginning to develop. The Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist prayer books all include &lt;a href=\"Yom%20HaShoah%23Liturgy%20for%20Yom%20HaShoah\"&gt;liturgical elements for Yom HaShoah&lt;/a&gt;, to be added to the regular weekday prayers. Conservative Judaism has written a scroll, called \"Megillat HaShoah,\" intended to become a definitive liturgical reading for Yom HaShoah. The Orthodox world\u2013even the segment that participates publicly in Yom HaShoah\u2013has been reluctant to write a liturgy for the day, preferring to compose \"&lt;a href=\"Kinnot\"&gt;Kinnot&lt;/a&gt;\" (prayers of lamentation) for recitation on &lt;a href=\"%23Tisha%20B%27av\"&gt;Tisha B'Av&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to ensure that public Yom HaShoah ceremonies in Israel do not violate Shabbat prohibitions, the date for Yom HaShoah varies as follows:\nYom Hazikaron\u2014Memorial Day.\n\"Yom Hazikaron\" (lit. \"Memorial Day\") is a day of remembrance of the fallen of Israel's wars. During the first years of Israel's independence, this remembrance was observed on &lt;a href=\"%23Yom%20Ha%27Atzmaut%E2%80%94Independence%20Day\"&gt;Yom Ha'atzmaut (Independence Day)&lt;/a&gt; itself. However, by 1951, the memorial observance was separated from the festive celebration of Independence Day and moved to its current date, the day before Yom Ha'atzmaut. Since 2000, the scope of the memorial has expanded to include civilians slain by acts of hostile &lt;a href=\"terrorism\"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. Its full name is now (\"Day of Remembrance for the Fallen of the Battles of Israel and the Victims of Terror\").\nPlaces of public entertainment are closed throughout Israel in recognition of the day. Many schools, businesses and other institutions conduct memorial services on this day, and it is customary to visit the graves of fallen soldiers and to recite memorial prayers there. The principal public observances are the evening opening ceremony at the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Wall\"&gt;Western Wall&lt;/a&gt; and the morning services of remembrance at military cemeteries throughout the country, each opened by the sounding of sirens. The public observances conclude with the service at the military cemetery on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Herzl\"&gt;Mount Herzl&lt;/a&gt; that serves as the transition to Yom Ha'atzmaut.\nOutside Israel, Yom HaZikaron observances are often folded into Yom Ha'atzmaut celebrations. Within Israel, Yom Hazikaron is always the day before Yom Ha'atzmaut, but that date moves to prevent violation of Sabbath prohibitions during the ceremonies of either day. See following section for details.\nYom Ha'atzmaut\u2014Israel Independence Day.\n\"Yom Ha'atzmaut\" () is Israel's &lt;a href=\"Independence%20Day%20%28Israel%29\"&gt;Independence Day&lt;/a&gt;. Observance of this day by Jews inside and outside Israel is widespread, and varies in tone from secular (military parades and barbecues) to religious (recitation of Hallel and new liturgies).\nAlthough Israel's independence was declared on a Friday, the Chief Rabbinate has long been mindful of the possibility of Yom Ha'atzmaut (and Yom Hazikaron) observances leading to violation of Sabbath prohibitions. To prevent such violations, the dates of Yom Hazikaron and Yom Ha'atzmaut vary as follows:\nNearly all non-\"\u1e25aredi\" Jewish religious communities have incorporated changes or enhancements to the liturgy in honor of Yom Ha'atzmaut and suspend the mourning practices of &lt;a href=\"%23Sefirah\"&gt;the period of Sefirat Ha'Omer&lt;/a&gt;. (See &lt;a href=\"Yom%20Ha%27atzmaut%23Religious%20customs\"&gt;Yom Ha'atzmaut\u2014Religious Customs&lt;/a&gt; for details.) Within the Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox communities, these changes are not without controversy, and customs continue to evolve.\n\"\u1e24aredi\" religious observance of Yom Ha'atzmaut varies widely. A few \"\u1e25aredim\" (especially &lt;a href=\"Sefardic%20%E1%B8%A4aredim\"&gt;Sefardic \u1e24aredim&lt;/a&gt;) celebrate the day in a reasonably similar way to the way non-\"\u1e25aredim\" do. Most \"\u1e25aredim\" simply treat the day indifferently; \"i.e.,\" as a regular day. And finally others (notably &lt;a href=\"Satmar%20Hasidism\"&gt;Satmar \u1e24asidim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neturei%20Karta\"&gt;Neturei Karta&lt;/a&gt;) mourn on the day because of their opposition to the enterprise of the State of Israel.\nYom Yerushalayim\u2014Jerusalem Day.\nJerusalem Day () marks the 1967 &lt;a href=\"reunification%20of%20Jerusalem\"&gt;reunification of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; under Israeli control during the &lt;a href=\"Six-Day%20War\"&gt;Six-Day War&lt;/a&gt;. This marked the first time in 19 years that the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Mount\"&gt;Temple Mount&lt;/a&gt; was accessible to Jews, and the first time since the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Temple\"&gt;Second Temple&lt;/a&gt; 1897 years earlier that the Temple Mount was under Jewish political control.\nAs with Yom Ha'atzmaut, celebrations of Yom Yerushalayim range from completely secular (including hikes to Jerusalem and a large parade through downtown Jerusalem) to religious (recitation of Hallel and new liturgies). Although Haredim do not participate in the liturgical changes, they are somewhat more likely to celebrate Yom Yerushalayim than the other modern Israeli holidays because of the importance of the liberation of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Wall\"&gt;Western Wall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20City%20of%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Old City of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutside Israel, observance of Yom Yerushalayim is widespread, especially in Orthodox circles. It has not gained as widespread acceptance as Yom Ha'atzmaut, especially among more politically liberal Jews, because of the continuing conflicts over the future of the city.\nYom Yerushalayim has not traditionally moved to avoid Shabbat desecration, although in 2012 the Chief Rabbinate began some efforts in that direction.\nYom HaAliyah\u2014Aliyah Day.\nAliyah Day () is an Israeli national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of Nisan. The day was established to acknowledge &lt;a href=\"Aliyah\"&gt;Aliyah&lt;/a&gt;, immigration to the Jewish state, as a core value of the State of Israel, and honor the ongoing contributions of Olim (immigrants) to Israeli society.\nImmigration to Israel is a recognized religious value of Judaism, sometimes referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20of%20Israel\"&gt;Gathering of Israel&lt;/a&gt;. The date chosen for Yom HaAliyah, 10 Nisan, has religious significance: it is the day on which Joshua and the Israelites crossed the Jordan River at &lt;a href=\"Gilgal\"&gt;Gilgal&lt;/a&gt; into the Promised Land. It was thus the first documented \"mass Aliyah\". The alternative date observed in the school system, 7 &lt;a href=\"Heshvan\"&gt;Heshvan&lt;/a&gt;, falls during the week of the Torah portion in which God instructs &lt;a href=\"Abraham\"&gt;Abraham&lt;/a&gt; to leave his home and his family and go up to the Land of Israel.\nAt the present time, observance of this day appears to be secular in nature.\nDay to commemorate the expulsion of Jews from Arab lands and Iran.\nThe Knesset established this observance in 2014. The purpose of this observance is to recognize the collective trauma of &lt;a href=\"Mizrahi%20Jews\"&gt;Mizrahi Jews&lt;/a&gt; during the period around the establishment of the State of Israel. Many Mizrachi Jews felt that their own suffering was being ignored, both in comparison to the suffering of &lt;a href=\"European%20Jewry\"&gt;European Jewry&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Holocaust\"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; and in comparison to the Palestinian &lt;a href=\"Nakba\"&gt;Nakba&lt;/a&gt;. The Gregorian-calendar date chosen is the day after the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Partition%20Plan%20for%20Palestine\"&gt;United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine&lt;/a&gt; was adopted, as that date marked the beginning of concentrated pressure and hostility against the community.\nAt the present time, observance of this day appears to be secular in nature.\nEthnic holidays.\nThe Israeli government officially recognizes three traditional holidays of ethnic Jewish communities in Israel. These days are also observed by their respective communities outside Israel."
