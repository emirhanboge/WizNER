    "text": "This article describes &lt;a href=\"periodic%20point\"&gt;periodic point&lt;/a&gt;s of some &lt;a href=\"Complex%20quadratic%20polynomial\"&gt;complex quadratic map&lt;/a&gt;s. A map is a formula for computing a value of a variable based on its own previous value or values; a &lt;a href=\"Quadratic%20equation\"&gt;quadratic&lt;/a&gt; map is one that involves the previous value raised to the &lt;a href=\"power%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;powers&lt;/a&gt; one and two; and a complex map is one in which the variable and the parameters are &lt;a href=\"complex%20number\"&gt;complex number&lt;/a&gt;s. A &lt;a href=\"periodic%20point\"&gt;periodic point&lt;/a&gt; of a map is a value of the variable that occurs repeatedly after intervals of a fixed length.\nThese periodic points play a role in the theories of &lt;a href=\"Fatou%20set\"&gt;Fatou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Julia%20set\"&gt;Julia set&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDefinitions.\nLet \nbe the &lt;a href=\"complex%20quadratic%20polynomial\"&gt;complex quadric mapping&lt;/a&gt;, where formula_2 and formula_3 are &lt;a href=\"complex%20number\"&gt;complex number&lt;/a&gt;s. \nNotationally, formula_4 is the formula_5-fold &lt;a href=\"Function%20composition\"&gt;composition&lt;/a&gt; of formula_6 with itself (not to be confused with the formula_5th &lt;a href=\"derivative\"&gt;derivative&lt;/a&gt; of formula_6)\u2014that is, the value after the \"k\"-th &lt;a href=\"Iterated%20function\"&gt;iteration of the function&lt;/a&gt; formula_9 Thus\nPeriodic points of a complex quadratic mapping of &lt;a href=\"Frequency\"&gt;period&lt;/a&gt; formula_11 are points formula_2 of the &lt;a href=\"phase%20space\"&gt;dynamical plane&lt;/a&gt; such that \nwhere formula_11 is the smallest positive &lt;a href=\"integer\"&gt;integer&lt;/a&gt; for which the equation holds at that \"z\".\nWe can introduce a new function: \nso periodic points are &lt;a href=\"zero%20of%20a%20function\"&gt;zeros&lt;/a&gt; of function formula_16: points \"z\" satisfying\nwhich is a polynomial of &lt;a href=\"degree%20of%20a%20polynomial\"&gt;degree&lt;/a&gt; formula_18\nNumber of periodic points.\nThe &lt;a href=\"degree%20of%20a%20polynomial\"&gt;degree&lt;/a&gt; of the polynomial formula_16 describing periodic points is formula_20 so &lt;a href=\"Fundamental%20theorem%20of%20algebra\"&gt;it has exactly&lt;/a&gt; formula_20 complex roots (= periodic points), counted with &lt;a href=\"Multiplicity_%28mathematics%29%23Multiplicity_of_a_root_of_a_polynomial\"&gt;multiplicity&lt;/a&gt;.\nStability of periodic points (orbit) - multiplier.\n \nThe multiplier (or eigenvalue, derivative) formula_22 of a rational map formula_23 iterated formula_11 times at cyclic point formula_25 is defined as:\nwhere formula_27 is the first &lt;a href=\"derivative\"&gt;derivative&lt;/a&gt; of formula_28 with respect to formula_2 at formula_25.\nBecause the multiplier is the same at all periodic points on a given orbit, it is called a multiplier of the periodic &lt;a href=\"orbit%20%28dynamics%29\"&gt;orbit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe multiplier is:\nA periodic point is\nPeriodic points\nPeriod-1 points (fixed points).\nFinite fixed points.\nLet us begin by finding all finite points left unchanged by one application of formula_23. These are the points that satisfy formula_40. That is, we wish to solve\nwhich can be rewritten as\nSince this is an ordinary &lt;a href=\"quadratic%20equation\"&gt;quadratic equation&lt;/a&gt; in one unknown, we can apply &lt;a href=\"quadratic%20formula\"&gt;the standard quadratic solution formula&lt;/a&gt;:\nSo for formula_45 we have two finite fixed points formula_46 and formula_47.\nSince \nwe have formula_51.\nThus fixed points are symmetrical about formula_52.\nComplex dynamics.\nHere different notation is commonly used:\nand \nAgain we have\nSince &lt;a href=\"Complex_quadratic_polynomial%23First_derivative_with_respect_to_z\"&gt;the derivative with respect to \"z\"&lt;/a&gt; is \nwe have\nThis implies that formula_60 can have at most one attractive fixed point. \nThese points are distinguished by the facts that:\nSpecial cases.\nAn important case of the quadratic mapping is formula_66. In this case, we get formula_67 and formula_68. In this case, 0 is a superattractive &lt;a href=\"Fixed%20point%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;fixed point&lt;/a&gt;, and 1 belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Julia%20set\"&gt;Julia set&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly one fixed point.\nWe have formula_69 exactly when formula_70 This equation has one solution, formula_71 in which case formula_72. In fact formula_73 is the largest positive, purely &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; value for which a finite attractor exists.\nInfinite fixed point.\nWe can extend the &lt;a href=\"complex%20plane\"&gt;complex plane&lt;/a&gt; formula_74 to the &lt;a href=\"Riemann%20sphere\"&gt;Riemann sphere (extended complex plane)&lt;/a&gt; formula_75 by adding &lt;a href=\"Point%20at%20infinity\"&gt;infinity&lt;/a&gt;:\nand extend formula_6 such that formula_78\nThen &lt;a href=\"Point%20at%20infinity\"&gt;infinity&lt;/a&gt; is:\nPeriod-2 cycles.\nPeriod-2 cycles are two distinct points formula_81 and formula_82 such that formula_83 and formula_84, and hence\nfor formula_86:\nEquating this to \"z\", we obtain\nThis equation is a polynomial of degree 4, and so has four (possibly non-distinct) solutions. However, we already know two of the solutions. They are formula_46 and formula_47, computed above, since if these points are left unchanged by one application of formula_23, then clearly they will be unchanged by more than one application of formula_23.\nOur 4th-order polynomial can therefore be factored in 2 ways:\nFirst method of factorization.\nThis expands directly as formula_94 (note the alternating signs), where\nWe already have two solutions, and only need the other two. Hence the problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic polynomial. In particular, note that\nand\nAdding these to the above, we get formula_101 and formula_102. Matching these against the coefficients from expanding formula_23, we get\nFrom this, we easily get\nFrom here, we construct a quadratic equation with formula_108 and apply the standard solution formula to get\nCloser examination shows that:\nmeaning these two points are the two points on a single period-2 cycle.\nSecond method of factorization.\nWe can factor the quartic by using &lt;a href=\"polynomial%20long%20division\"&gt;polynomial long division&lt;/a&gt; to divide out the factors formula_113 and formula_114 which account for the two fixed points formula_46 and formula_47 (whose values were given earlier and which still remain at the fixed point after two iterations):\nThe roots of the first factor are the two fixed points. They are repelling outside the main cardioid.\nThe second factor has the two roots\nThese two roots, which are the same as those found by the first method, form the period-2 orbit.\nSpecial cases.\nAgain, let us look at formula_66. Then\nboth of which are complex numbers. We have formula_122. Thus, both these points are \"hiding\" in the Julia set.\nAnother special case is formula_123, which gives formula_124 and formula_125. This gives the well-known superattractive cycle found in the largest period-2 lobe of the quadratic Mandelbrot set.\nCycles for period greater than 2.\nThe degree of the equation formula_126 is 2\"n\"; thus for example, to find the points on a 3-cycle we would need to solve an equation of degree 8. After factoring out the factors giving the two fixed points, we would have a sixth degree equation.\n&lt;a href=\"Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini%20theorem\"&gt;There is no general solution&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nth%20root\"&gt;radicals&lt;/a&gt; to polynomial equations of degree five or higher, so the points on a cycle of period greater than 2 must in general be computed using &lt;a href=\"Root-finding%20algorithm\"&gt;numerical methods&lt;/a&gt;. However, in the specific case of period 4 the cyclical points have lengthy expressions in radicals.\nIn the case \"c\" = \u20132, &lt;a href=\"trigonometry\"&gt;trigonometric&lt;/a&gt; solutions exist for the periodic points of all periods. The case formula_127 is equivalent to the &lt;a href=\"logistic%20map\"&gt;logistic map&lt;/a&gt; case \"r\" = 4: formula_128 Here the equivalence is given by formula_129 One of the \"k\"-cycles of the logistic variable \"x\" (all of which cycles are repelling) is "
