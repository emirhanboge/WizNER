    "text": "Kongsberg () is a historical &lt;a href=\"mining%20town\"&gt;mining town&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Norway\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Buskerud\"&gt;Buskerud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Viken%20%28county%29\"&gt;Viken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Counties%20of%20Norway\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. The city is located on the river &lt;a href=\"Numedalsl%C3%A5gen\"&gt;Numedalsl\u00e5gen&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance to the valley of &lt;a href=\"Numedal\"&gt;Numedal&lt;/a&gt;. Kongsberg has been a centre of &lt;a href=\"silver\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; mining, &lt;a href=\"Weapon\"&gt;arms&lt;/a&gt; production and forestry for centuries, and is the site of high technology industry including the headquarters of Norway's largest defence contractor &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Gruppen\"&gt;Kongsberg Gruppen&lt;/a&gt;.\nKongsberg, formerly spelled Konningsberg ( \"King's Mountain\"), was developed as a mining city on the basis of the &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Silver%20Mines\"&gt;Kongsberg Silver Mines&lt;/a&gt;, founded by and named after King &lt;a href=\"Christian%20IV%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Christian IV of Denmark and Norway&lt;/a&gt; in 1624. The king invited German engineers and other specialists from &lt;a href=\"Saxony\"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Harz\"&gt;Harz&lt;/a&gt; region to help build the mining company. As a mining city, Kongsberg had a distinct urban culture that contrasted with its surroundings, strongly influenced by the traditions of mining communities in Germany and where the German language was extensively used in mining business and for religious services. In the first years nearly half of the city's population were German immigrants, and the majority of the engineers and executives were German immigrants and their descendants well into the 19th century, becoming a distinct social class called mining families that formed the educated social elite of Kongsberg in contrast to the Norwegian farming population; the first Nobel laureate in economics &lt;a href=\"Ragnar%20Frisch\"&gt;Ragnar Frisch&lt;/a&gt; belonged to such a Kongsberg mining family. By the 18th century Kongsberg was Norway's second largest city, second only to &lt;a href=\"Bergen\"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt;. Kongsberg was one of Norway's two privileged mining cities and thus formed a special mining jurisdiction (), and only became part of &lt;a href=\"Buskerud\"&gt;Buskerud&lt;/a&gt; county in 1760. On 1 January 1838, the &lt;a href=\"formannskapsdistrikt\"&gt;new national law&lt;/a&gt;, creating local governments, made Kongsberg a municipality. The rural municipalities of &lt;a href=\"Ytre%20Sandsv%C3%A6r\"&gt;Ytre Sandsv\u00e6r&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%98vre%20Sandsv%C3%A6r\"&gt;\u00d8vre Sandsv\u00e6r&lt;/a&gt; were merged into the municipality of Kongsberg in 1964. Kongsberg gradually lost importance to other cities in the 19th century, particularly to the rapidly growing capital of &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Christiania&lt;/a&gt; (Oslo).\nThe Kongsberg Silver Mines closed in 1958 after operating for 334 years and is today a museum and the city's main tourist attraction. Kongsberg remains the site of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Norwegian%20Mint\"&gt;Royal Norwegian Mint&lt;/a&gt; (), which mints &lt;a href=\"Coins%20of%20the%20Norwegian%20krone\"&gt;Norwegian coins&lt;/a&gt; and also produces circulating and collectors' coins for other countries. Kongsberg is also the home of Norway's major &lt;a href=\"defence%20contractor\"&gt;defence contractor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Gruppen\"&gt;Kongsberg Gruppen&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1814. Two of its best-known products were the &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Colt\"&gt;Kongsberg Colt&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Krag%E2%80%93J%C3%B8rgensen\"&gt;Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen&lt;/a&gt; rifle.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20South-Eastern%20Norway\"&gt;University of South-Eastern Norway&lt;/a&gt; Kongsberg campus, and &lt;a href=\"Tinius%20Olsen\"&gt;Tinius Olsen's school&lt;/a&gt;, a combined technical vocational college and secondary school, are located in Kongsberg.\nHistory.\nKongsberg was founded by &lt;a href=\"Denmark-Norway\"&gt;Danish-Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; King &lt;a href=\"Christian%20IV%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Christian IV&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; community in 1624 after the discovery of silver. In its second year, the town of Kongsberg and the &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Silver%20Mines\"&gt;Kongsberg Silver Mines&lt;/a&gt; began. According to official records, &lt;a href=\"silver\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; was first discovered by the shepherds children Helga Verp and Jacob Grosvold in the summer of 1623. However, the existence of deposits of precious metals was known previously, as evidenced by indications of earlier silver mining. With the rise of silver mining, Kongsberg became the largest industrial center in &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; before the industrial revolution. At the peak of silver mining in the early eighteenth century, Kongsberg's silver mines and related industries contributed 10% of the &lt;a href=\"Denmark%E2%80%93Norway\"&gt;Denmark\u2013Norway&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gross%20national%20product\"&gt;gross national product&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo develop the &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Silver%20Mines\"&gt;Kongsberg Silver Mines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christian%20IV\"&gt;Christian IV&lt;/a&gt; hired Germans from the silver mines of &lt;a href=\"Saxony\"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harz\"&gt;Harz&lt;/a&gt; and brought in Germans from other mines in &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. The Germans brought their knowledge of mining technology, especially important during the start-up phase. Before 1623, the city was located in the royal territory of &lt;a href=\"Sandsv%C3%A6r\"&gt;Sandsv\u00e6r&lt;/a&gt;.\nFour years after the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Silver%20Mines\"&gt;Kongsberg Silver Mines&lt;/a&gt;, most of the 1,500 workers and officials were still German. Gradually, Norwegians entered the workforce and were hired as supervisors. In 1636, 1,370 Germans and 1,600 Norwegians were employed there. In 1648, there were 1,500 Germans and 2,400 Norwegians working in Kongsberg.\nGunpowder was officially introduced in mining in 1681. Mining in the particularly hard rock of Kongsberg Mountain was energy intensive, so the silver mine continued to develop new technology to reduce production costs. A large artificial dam powered the mine's hoists before electricity was introduced. In 1624, a road from &lt;a href=\"Hokksund\"&gt;Hokksund&lt;/a&gt; to Kongsberg was built to serve the &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Silver%20Mines\"&gt;Kongsberg Silver Mines&lt;/a&gt;, the most important road built in Norway in the 17th century. In 1665, the road was extended to &lt;a href=\"Kristiansand\"&gt;Kristiansand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Larvik\"&gt;Larvik&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 1683, the mining industry was an important industry of the state. The rapid development of Kongsberg meant that the number of workers in the city had increased significantly by the end of the 17th century. The proportion of Norwegians in the workforce increased, but for a long time, the main staff was dominated by Germans. Kongsberg was almost an outpost of Germany in Norway: the mine had a German name, and the official language was German, only later becoming bilingual (German and &lt;a href=\"Danish%20language\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt;). In Kongsberg, the German mountain justice system was also used. Legally, this means that the city was bound by independent regulations, partially separating the mining community from the country's legal system. The Germans brought with them the Knappschaft, a guild-like association of miners that provided including free medical assistance, a pension plan, worker sick leave and a Saturday break. The ring agriculture characteristic of Kongsberg may also have been inspired by the German pattern.\nThe proceeds from silver mining provided a valuable assistance to the tight finances of Denmark. &lt;a href=\"Denmark%E2%80%93Norway\"&gt;Denmark\u2013Norway&lt;/a&gt; relied heavily on the silver of Kongsberg to support an ongoing war against Sweden. Precious metals also became more and more important in the currency, and to get closer to its source of raw materials, the Royal Mint moved in 1686 from &lt;a href=\"Akershus\"&gt;Akershus&lt;/a&gt; to Kongsberg. During the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Northern%20War\"&gt;Great Northern War&lt;/a&gt; in 1716, the city became the main target of &lt;a href=\"Karl%20XII\"&gt;Karl XII&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s foray into Norderhof.\nKongsberg was particularly known for its &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Silver%20Mines\"&gt;Kongsberg Silver Mines&lt;/a&gt; and their high purity. Kongsberg's ore also contained a certain amount of gold and large amounts of &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cobalt\"&gt;cobalt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"zinc\"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fluorite\"&gt;fluorite&lt;/a&gt;. Roughly of silver was extracted between the discovery of the silver &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; seams in 1623 and the last year of &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; in 1957. The workforce at the Kongsberg silver mine began to increase substantially at the end of the 17th century. In the 1769 &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt;, the mines employed about 4,000 workers. With 8,000 inhabitants in all, the town was the second largest in Norway, after &lt;a href=\"Bergen\"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt; (and thus larger than today's capital, &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn Norway's 1749 &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt;, Kongsberg was the most populous town in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Norway\"&gt;Eastern Norway&lt;/a&gt;. It was granted its &lt;a href=\"royal%20charter\"&gt;royal charter&lt;/a&gt; of trade\u2014amounting to official &lt;a href=\"market%20town\"&gt;township&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in 1802. Following several hard years with reduced silver output from the mines, the war of 1807\u20131814, and a severe town fire in 1810 where 56 houses on the west side were destroyed, mining was complemented by the government establishing a &lt;a href=\"defense%20industry\"&gt;defense industry&lt;/a&gt; in 1814. By 1835, the population had declined to 3,540.\nKongsberg is home to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Norwegian%20Mint\"&gt;Royal Norwegian Mint&lt;/a&gt; (), which mints &lt;a href=\"Coins%20of%20the%20Norwegian%20krone\"&gt;Norwegian coins&lt;/a&gt; and also produces circulating and collectors' coins for other countries such as Israel. It was established in 1686, and was renamed from the \"Royal Norwegian Mint\" () in 2004 after having been sold to private investors (the &lt;a href=\"Mint%20of%20Finland\"&gt;Mint of Finland&lt;/a&gt; and Norwegian company &lt;a href=\"Samlerhuset\"&gt;Samlerhuset&lt;/a&gt;) in 2003. Kongsberg is also the site of the &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20School%20of%20Mines\"&gt;Kongsberg School of Mines&lt;/a&gt; (\"Kongsberg Bergseminar\"), an academic institution for mining technology which operated from 1757 to 1814.\nDuring peaceful times, the defence industry gradually evolved into many other kinds of &lt;a href=\"high%20tech\"&gt;high tech&lt;/a&gt; activities as well, now dominating the town's employment. In 1987, however, the state-owned Kongsberg Weapons Factory (\"Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk\") suffered a major financial crisis as well as accusations of breaching the &lt;a href=\"CoCom\"&gt;CoCom&lt;/a&gt; rules by selling sensitive technology to the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Soviet bloc&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the company was split into several smaller units and partly sold to private investors. Today, the separate firms thrive as one of Norway's main high-tech industrial clusters, centering on the defence and maritime company &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Gruppen\"&gt;Kongsberg Gruppen&lt;/a&gt; which is listed on the &lt;a href=\"Oslo%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;Oslo Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 13 October 2021, &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20attack\"&gt;a man stabbed multiple people with a bladed weapon&lt;/a&gt;, killing five and injuring three. Police subsequently apprehended a suspect whom the Kongsberg police chief later told reporters was a &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20convert\"&gt;Muslim convert&lt;/a&gt;.\nCoat-of-arms.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;coat-of-arms&lt;/a&gt; is from modern times and was designed by &lt;a href=\"Hallvard%20Tr%C3%A6tteberg\"&gt;Hallvard Tr\u00e6tteberg&lt;/a&gt;. They were granted on 25 August 1972. They are based upon the old seal for the city from 1689 which shows the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20mythology\"&gt;Roman god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Janus%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Janus&lt;/a&gt; dressed as an &lt;a href=\"Roman%20emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt; (to represent the king); the &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and the pair of scales represents &lt;a href=\"justice\"&gt;justice&lt;/a&gt;. The colour green represents the forests, silver represents the mountains, and gold represents wealth.\nGeography.\nKongsberg is located at the mouth of the valley &lt;a href=\"Numedal\"&gt;Numedal&lt;/a&gt;; farther to the South the valley is called &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A5gendalen\"&gt;L\u00e5gendalen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe neighbouring municipalities of Kongsberg are &lt;a href=\"Flesberg\"&gt;Flesberg&lt;/a&gt; to the north; &lt;a href=\"%C3%98vre%20Eiker\"&gt;\u00d8vre Eiker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hof%2C%20Vestfold\"&gt;Hof&lt;/a&gt; to the east; &lt;a href=\"Lardal\"&gt;Lardal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siljan%2C%20Norway\"&gt;Siljan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skien\"&gt;Skien&lt;/a&gt; to the south; and &lt;a href=\"Sauherad\"&gt;Sauherad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Notodden\"&gt;Notodden&lt;/a&gt; to the west. Of these, the two first lie in Buskerud county like Kongsberg, while Hof and Lardal lie in &lt;a href=\"Vestfold\"&gt;Vestfold&lt;/a&gt;, and the others lie in &lt;a href=\"Telemark\"&gt;Telemark&lt;/a&gt;. The town is divided by the river &lt;a href=\"Numedalsl%C3%A5gen\"&gt;Numedalsl\u00e5gen&lt;/a&gt;, which has three &lt;a href=\"waterfall\"&gt;waterfall&lt;/a&gt;s in the town itself.\nClimate.\nKongsberg has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20continental%20climate\"&gt;humid continental climate&lt;/a&gt; (Dfb), with late summer and autumn as the wettest season and February - April as the driest season. Kongsberg has warm summers by Norwegian standards; average daily highs in summer are comparable to Oslo. In winter Kongsberg is colder than Oslo, and snow cover on the ground is common. The largest snow depth recorded is 123 cm on 3 March 2006.The all-time high temperature was recorded 19 June 1970, while 10 August 1975 recorded . The all-time low was recorded 3 January 1941. As pr January 2022, all monthly record lows are old, 11 from before 1950. All record highs are from after 1950, 5 of 12 from after 2000 (pr January 2022). Kongsberg has recorded as early as 14 May (in 2000). The weather station Kongsberg brannstasjon has recorded since 2003, extremes includes data from Kongsberg II, III and IV.\nTransportation.\nThe main highways are the &lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E134\"&gt;E134&lt;/a&gt;, crossing Kongsberg east to west (and connected to the &lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E18\"&gt;E18&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20national%20road\"&gt;Norwegian national road&lt;/a&gt; 40 \"(Riksvei 40)\", going north to south. The &lt;a href=\"S%C3%B8rland%20Line\"&gt;S\u00f8rland Line&lt;/a&gt; stops at Kongsberg Rail Station, with connection to local and regional bus lines.\nCulture.\nWith the population increase during the town's silver mining heyday of the mid-eighteenth century came the need for a new church, which was built over a 21-year period and inaugurated in 1761. It has an austere red &lt;a href=\"brick\"&gt;brick&lt;/a&gt; exterior, but a richly decorated &lt;a href=\"baroque\"&gt;baroque&lt;/a&gt; interior including unique &lt;a href=\"chandelier\"&gt;chandelier&lt;/a&gt;s made at \"N\u00f8stetangen\" Glass Works in neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Hokksund\"&gt;Hokksund&lt;/a&gt;. Kongsberg Church remains one of the largest in Norway with a &lt;a href=\"seating%20capacity\"&gt;seating capacity&lt;/a&gt; of 2,400.\nThe church's original baroque-era &lt;a href=\"pipe%20organ\"&gt;pipe organ&lt;/a&gt;, made by renowned German &lt;a href=\"organ%20%28music%29\"&gt;organ&lt;/a&gt; builder &lt;a href=\"Gottfried%20Heinrich%20Gloger\"&gt;Gottfried Heinrich Gloger&lt;/a&gt; in 1760\u201365, was fully restored by &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BCrgen%20Ahrend\"&gt;J\u00fcrgen Ahrend&lt;/a&gt; in 1999\u20132000 and reopened to great fanfare in January 2001. With its 42 voices, it is the largest baroque organ in &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of January each year, the Gloger Music Festival now draws a select crowd of artists and music lovers from all over the world.\nSince 1964, Kongsberg has hosted &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Jazzfestival\"&gt;Kongsberg Jazzfestival&lt;/a&gt;, an annual international &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; festival. Heavily sponsored by the local industry, prominent world acts such as &lt;a href=\"BB%20King\"&gt;BB King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diana%20Krall\"&gt;Diana Krall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ornette%20Coleman\"&gt;Ornette Coleman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Redman\"&gt;Joshua Redman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Scofield\"&gt;John Scofield&lt;/a&gt; have played at the festival in recent years.\nSports.\nThe town is known for many great &lt;a href=\"ski%20jumping\"&gt;ski jumper&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Birger%20Ruud\"&gt;Birger Ruud&lt;/a&gt; and his two brothers, as well as many other townsmen, such as &lt;a href=\"Petter%20Hugsted\"&gt;Petter Hugsted&lt;/a&gt;, won numerous medals in Winter Olympics and other international championships in the 1930s and 1940s. The first ski jumping technique, the &lt;a href=\"Kongsberger%20technique\"&gt;Konsberger&lt;/a&gt; was developed by &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20Tullin%20Thams\"&gt;Jacob Tullin Thams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sigmund%20Ruud\"&gt;Sigmund Ruud&lt;/a&gt; in Kongsberg, and was the most popular ski jumping technique from the late 1920s to the late 1950s. Their medals and equipment can be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Skiing%20Museum\"&gt;Kongsberg Skiing Museum&lt;/a&gt; (\"Kongsberg Skimuseum\") which is co-located with the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Mining%20Museum\"&gt;Norwegian Mining Museum&lt;/a&gt; (\"Norsk Bergverksmuseum\") in central Kongsberg. Inventor of the modern &lt;a href=\"ski%20binding\"&gt;ski binding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norwegian-American\"&gt;Norwegian-American&lt;/a&gt; skier and Olympic skiing coach &lt;a href=\"Hjalmar%20Hvam\"&gt;Hjalmar Hvam&lt;/a&gt;, was born in Kongsberg in 1902.\nRecent winter sports athletes of the Kongsberg region include Olympic snowboarders &lt;a href=\"Stine%20Brun%20Kjeldaas\"&gt;Stine Brun Kjeldaas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silje%20Norendal\"&gt;Silje Norendal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halvor%20Lunn\"&gt;Halvor Lunn&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"cross-country%20skiing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;cross-country ski&lt;/a&gt; sprinter &lt;a href=\"B%C3%B8rre%20N%C3%A6ss\"&gt;B\u00f8rre N\u00e6ss&lt;/a&gt; of the village \"Eftel\u00f8t\"; and ski jumper &lt;a href=\"Sigurd%20Pettersen\"&gt;Sigurd Pettersen&lt;/a&gt; of nearby municipality &lt;a href=\"Rollag\"&gt;Rollag&lt;/a&gt; (60\u00a0km/37\u00a0mi north of Kongsberg). A large ski centre for &lt;a href=\"alpine%20skiing\"&gt;alpine skiing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"snowboard\"&gt;snowboard&lt;/a&gt;ing, with several &lt;a href=\"ski%20lift\"&gt;lift&lt;/a&gt;s and ca 320\u00a0m of height difference has been in operation and gradually expanding since 1965. Kongsberg hosted the cross-country skiing parts of the 2006 &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20skiing\"&gt;Nordic skiing&lt;/a&gt; National Championships. The arranging sports club was IL Skrim, the ski tracks being located at &lt;a href=\"Heistadmoen\"&gt;Heistadmoen&lt;/a&gt;, a former military camp.\nThe local basketball team &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg%20Miners\"&gt;Kongsberg Miners&lt;/a&gt; is regarded one of the best teams in the country.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1978%20World%20Orienteering%20Championships\"&gt;1978 World Orienteering Championships&lt;/a&gt; were held in Kongsberg.\nThe crowns in H\u00e5vet.\nThis attraction (\"Kronene i H\u00e5vet\") is a site where Norwegian royal monograms have been carved into the mountainside overlooking Kongsberg to mark royal visits to the city. In June 1704 King &lt;a href=\"Frederik%20IV\"&gt;Frederik IV&lt;/a&gt; visited Kongsberg and started a tradition that is still celebrated. King Frederik also arranged for the monograms of visits from earlier monarchs to be recorded as well.\nThe first monogram on the hillside property belonged to &lt;a href=\"Christian%20IV\"&gt;Christian IV&lt;/a&gt; who in 1624 founded Kongsberg at the site of the newly discovered silver deposits.
