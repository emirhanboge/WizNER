    "text": "The Church of England (C of E) is a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Christian%20denominations\"&gt;Christian church&lt;/a&gt; which is the &lt;a href=\"established%20church\"&gt;established church&lt;/a&gt; of England. The &lt;a href=\"archbishop%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;archbishop of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; is the most senior &lt;a href=\"clergy\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;, although the &lt;a href=\"Monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;monarch&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Governor%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England\"&gt;supreme governor&lt;/a&gt;. The Church of England is also the &lt;a href=\"mother%20church\"&gt;mother church&lt;/a&gt; of the international &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Communion\"&gt;Anglican Communion&lt;/a&gt;. It traces its history to the Christian church recorded as existing in the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Roman province of Britain&lt;/a&gt; by the 3rd century and to the 6th-century &lt;a href=\"Gregorian%20mission\"&gt;Gregorian mission&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Augustine%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Augustine of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe English church renounced &lt;a href=\"papal\"&gt;papal&lt;/a&gt; authority when &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry\u00a0VIII&lt;/a&gt; failed to secure a papal &lt;a href=\"annulment\"&gt;annulment&lt;/a&gt; of his marriage to &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;Catherine of Aragon&lt;/a&gt; in 1534. The &lt;a href=\"English%20Reformation\"&gt;English Reformation&lt;/a&gt; accelerated under &lt;a href=\"Edward%20VI%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward\u00a0VI&lt;/a&gt;'s regents, before a brief &lt;a href=\"Second%20Statute%20of%20Repeal\"&gt;restoration of papal authority&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Mary%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Queen Mary I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20Spain\"&gt;King Philip&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20Supremacy%201558\"&gt;Act of Supremacy 1558&lt;/a&gt; renewed the breach, and the &lt;a href=\"Elizabethan%20Settlement\"&gt;Elizabethan Settlement&lt;/a&gt; charted a course enabling the English church to describe itself as both Reformed and Catholic:\nIn the earlier phase of the &lt;a href=\"English%20Reformation\"&gt;English Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, there were both &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Catholic%20martyrs%20of%20the%20English%20Reformation\"&gt;Catholic martyrs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Protestant%20martyrs%20of%20the%20English%20Reformation\"&gt;radical Protestant&lt;/a&gt; martyrs. The later phases saw the &lt;a href=\"English%20Penal%20Laws\"&gt;Penal Laws&lt;/a&gt; punish &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nonconformist%20%28Protestantism%29\"&gt;nonconforming Protestants&lt;/a&gt;. In the 17th century, the &lt;a href=\"Puritan\"&gt;Puritan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian\"&gt;Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt; factions continued to challenge the leadership of the church which under the Stuarts veered towards a more catholic interpretation of the Elizabethan Settlement especially under Archbishop Laud and the rise of the concept of Anglicanism as the \"&lt;a href=\"via%20media\"&gt;via media&lt;/a&gt;\". After the victory of the Parliamentarians, the Prayer Book was abolished and the Presbyterian and Independent factions dominated. The &lt;a href=\"episcopacy\"&gt;episcopacy&lt;/a&gt; (bishops) was abolished in 1646. The &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%281660%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; restored the Church of England, episcopacy and the Prayer Book. Papal recognition of &lt;a href=\"George%20III\"&gt;George III&lt;/a&gt; in 1766 led to greater religious tolerance.\nSince the English Reformation, the Church of England has used English in the &lt;a href=\"liturgy\"&gt;liturgy&lt;/a&gt;. The church contains several doctrinal strands, the main three being known as &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Catholic\"&gt;Anglo-Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Anglicanism\"&gt;evangelical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"broad%20church\"&gt;broad church&lt;/a&gt;. Tensions between theological conservatives and progressives find expression in debates over the &lt;a href=\"ordination%20of%20women%20in%20the%20Anglican%20Communion\"&gt;ordination of women&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"homosexuality%20and%20Anglicanism\"&gt;homosexuality&lt;/a&gt;. The church includes both &lt;a href=\"liberal%20Christianity\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; and conservative clergy and members.\nThe governing structure of the church is based on &lt;a href=\"diocese\"&gt;diocese&lt;/a&gt;s, each presided over by a bishop. Within each diocese are local parishes. The &lt;a href=\"General%20Synod%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England\"&gt;General Synod of the Church of England&lt;/a&gt; is the legislative body for the church and comprises bishops, other clergy and &lt;a href=\"laity\"&gt;laity&lt;/a&gt;. Its measures must be approved by both &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Houses of Parliament&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly Christianity in England.\nAccording to tradition, Christianity arrived in Britain in the &lt;a href=\"Christianity%20in%20the%201st%20century\"&gt;1st&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Christianity%20in%20the%202nd%20century\"&gt;2nd century&lt;/a&gt;, during which time southern Britain became part of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The earliest historical evidence of Christianity among the native &lt;a href=\"Britons%20%28historical%29\"&gt;Britons&lt;/a&gt; is found in the writings of such early Christian Fathers as &lt;a href=\"Tertullian\"&gt;Tertullian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Origen\"&gt;Origen&lt;/a&gt; in the first years of the &lt;a href=\"Christianity%20in%20the%203rd%20century\"&gt;3rd century&lt;/a&gt;. Three &lt;a href=\"Romano-British\"&gt;Romano-British&lt;/a&gt; bishops, including &lt;a href=\"Restitutus\"&gt;Restitutus&lt;/a&gt;, are known to have been present at the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Arles%20%28314%29\"&gt;Council of Arles in 314&lt;/a&gt;. Others attended the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Serdica\"&gt;Council of Serdica&lt;/a&gt; in 347 and that of &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Ariminum\"&gt;Ariminum&lt;/a&gt; in 360, and a number of references to the church in &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Roman Britain&lt;/a&gt; are found in the writings of &lt;a href=\"Christianity%20in%20the%204th%20century\"&gt;4th century&lt;/a&gt; Christian fathers. Britain was the home of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;, who opposed &lt;a href=\"Augustine%20of%20Hippo\"&gt;Augustine of Hippo&lt;/a&gt;'s theology of &lt;a href=\"original%20sin\"&gt;original sin&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Christianity was long established as the religion of the Britons at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20invasion%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Christian Britons made little progress in converting the newcomers from their &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20paganism\"&gt;native paganism&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, in 597, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Gregory%20I\"&gt;Pope Gregory I&lt;/a&gt; sent the &lt;a href=\"prior\"&gt;prior&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Gregorio%20Magno%20al%20Celio\"&gt;Abbey of St Andrew's&lt;/a&gt; (later canonised as &lt;a href=\"Augustine%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;Augustine of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;) from Rome to evangelise the &lt;a href=\"Angles\"&gt;Angles&lt;/a&gt;. This event is known as the &lt;a href=\"Gregorian%20mission\"&gt;Gregorian mission&lt;/a&gt; and is the date the Church of England generally marks as the beginning of its formal history. With the help of Christians already residing in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;, Augustine established his church at &lt;a href=\"Canterbury\"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kent\"&gt;Kingdom of Kent&lt;/a&gt;, and became the first in the series of &lt;a href=\"archbishops%20of%20Canterbury\"&gt;archbishops of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; in 598. A later archbishop, the Greek &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20of%20Tarsus\"&gt;Theodore of Tarsus&lt;/a&gt;, also contributed to the organisation of Christianity in England. The Church of England has been in continuous existence since the days of St Augustine, with the archbishop of Canterbury as its episcopal head. Despite the various disruptions of the Reformation and the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the Church of England considers itself to be the same church which was more formally organised by Augustine.\nWhile some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the &lt;a href=\"Synod%20of%20Whitby\"&gt;Synod of Whitby&lt;/a&gt;, the Christian in the British Isles was under papal authority from earliest times. Queen &lt;a href=\"Bertha%20of%20Kent\"&gt;Bertha of Kent&lt;/a&gt; was among the Christians in England who recognised papal authority before Augustine arrived, and Celtic Christians were carrying out missionary work with papal approval long before the Synod of Whitby.\nThe Synod of Whitby established the Roman date for Easter and the Roman style of monastic tonsure in England. This meeting of the ecclesiastics with Roman customs with local bishops was summoned in 664 at Saint Hilda's double monastery of Streonshalh (Strean\u00e6shalch), later called &lt;a href=\"Whitby%20Abbey\"&gt;Whitby Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. It was presided over by &lt;a href=\"Oswiu\"&gt;King Oswiu&lt;/a&gt;, who did not engage in the debate but made the final ruling. The final ruling was decided in favour of Roman tradition because St. Peter holds the keys to the gate of Heaven.\nSeparation from Rome.\nIn 1534, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;King Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; separated the English Church from Rome. A theological separation had been foreshadowed by various movements within the English Church, such as &lt;a href=\"Lollardy\"&gt;Lollardy&lt;/a&gt;, but the English Reformation gained political support when Henry VIII wanted an &lt;a href=\"annulment\"&gt;annulment&lt;/a&gt; of his marriage to &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;Catherine of Aragon&lt;/a&gt; so he could marry &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Boleyn\"&gt;Anne Boleyn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Clement%20VII\"&gt;Pope Clement VII&lt;/a&gt;, considering that the earlier marriage had been entered under a &lt;a href=\"papal%20dispensation\"&gt;papal dispensation&lt;/a&gt; and how Catherine's nephew, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Emperor Charles V&lt;/a&gt;, might react to such a move, refused the annulment. Eventually, Henry, although theologically opposed to Protestantism, took the position of &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Governor%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Protector and Supreme Head of the English Church and Clergy&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the annulment of his marriage. He was &lt;a href=\"Excommunication%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;excommunicated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Paul%20III\"&gt;Pope Paul III&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1536\u201340 Henry VIII engaged in the &lt;a href=\"Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries\"&gt;Dissolution of the Monasteries&lt;/a&gt;, which controlled much of the richest land. He disbanded &lt;a href=\"monastery\"&gt;monasteries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"priory\"&gt;priories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"convent\"&gt;convent&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"friaries\"&gt;friaries&lt;/a&gt; in England, Wales and Ireland, appropriated their income, disposed of their assets, and provided pensions for the former residents. The properties were sold to pay for the wars. Bernard argues:\nThe dissolution of the monasteries in the late 1530s was one of the most revolutionary events in English history. There were nearly 900 religious houses in England, around 260 for monks, 300 for regular canons, 142 nunneries and 183 friaries; some 12,000 people in total, 4,000 monks, 3,000 canons, 3,000 friars and 2,000 nuns...one adult man in fifty was in religious orders.\nHenry maintained a strong preference for traditional Catholic practices and, during his reign, Protestant reformers were unable to make many changes to the practices of the Church of England. Indeed, this part of Henry's reign saw trials for heresy of Protestants as well as Roman Catholics.\nUnder his son, &lt;a href=\"King%20Edward%20VI\"&gt;King Edward VI&lt;/a&gt;, more Protestant-influenced forms of worship were adopted. Under the leadership of the archbishop of Canterbury, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Cranmer\"&gt;Thomas Cranmer&lt;/a&gt;, a more radical reformation proceeded. A new pattern of worship was set out in the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer\"&gt;Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a&gt; of 1549 and then 1552. These, particularly the Prayer Book of 1549 were based on the previous liturgy, but both were influenced by Protestant doctrines such as justification by faith alone, the rejection of the sacrifice of the Mass, and the &lt;a href=\"Real%20presence%20of%20Christ%20in%20the%20Eucharist\"&gt;real presence&lt;/a&gt; understood as physical presence. Cranmer in this matter was close to the Calvinist interpretation in that he believed Christ was truly and really present in the Eucharist but after a spiritual manner. The Prayer Books were ambiguous. In places there was a statement susceptible to an interpretation of the real presence and at others refers to 'spiritual food' or has them put together, as seen in the texts of the Consecration Prayer, Prayer of Humble Access, and the Words of Administration. A doctrinal confession of sorts of the reformed Church of England was set out in the &lt;a href=\"Forty-two%20Articles\"&gt;Forty-two Articles&lt;/a&gt; (later revised to thirty-nine). The reformation however was cut short by the death of the king. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Mary%20I\"&gt;Queen Mary I&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded him, returned England again to the authority of the papacy, thereby ending the first attempt at an independent Church of England. During her co-reign with her husband, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20Spain\"&gt;King Philip&lt;/a&gt;, some hundreds of church leaders and common people were burnt for their refusal to recant of their reformed faith. These are known as the &lt;a href=\"Marian%20martyrs\"&gt;Marian martyrs&lt;/a&gt; and the persecution led to her nickname of \"Bloody Mary\".\nMary also died childless and so it was left to the new regime of her half-sister &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20I\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth I&lt;/a&gt; to resolve the direction of the church. The &lt;a href=\"Elizabethan%20Settlement\"&gt;Elizabethan Settlement&lt;/a&gt; tried to find a middle way between radical Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, the \"via media\" (a term that actually only became current in the 1620s), as the character of the Church of England, a church moderately Reformed in doctrine, as expressed in the &lt;a href=\"Thirty-Nine%20Articles\"&gt;Thirty-Nine Articles&lt;/a&gt;, and emphasising continuity with the catholic and apostolic traditions of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20Fathers\"&gt;Church Fathers&lt;/a&gt;. Kneeling reverently to receive communion was the custom. The three-fold ministry of bishops, priests and deacons was maintained; the institutional continuity of the church was preserved without break (at Elizabeth's accession almost all of the clergy had been ordained using the Roman Pontifical) by bishops in the &lt;a href=\"apostolic%20succession\"&gt;apostolic succession&lt;/a&gt;. However, the character of the church was changed by the adoption of some reformed doctrines, the simplification of the outwards forms of worship and the abandonment of traditional vestments and art work; the retention of medieval canon law, liturgical music and a much shortened Calendar of Saints and Feast Days. The 42 Articles were reduced to &lt;a href=\"Thirty-Nine%20Articles%20of%20Religion\"&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;, one of which removed the condemnation of the Pope, and another, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rubric\"&gt;Black Rubric&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed kneeling to receive communion as long as it did not imply belief in the real presence and suggestion of adoration, the removal of which cancelled what it had prohibited. The rubric was restored in 1662 but the prohibition referred to in it referred to the presence of Christ in his natural body (rather than a real presence after the manner of a sacrament). In part as a response to her excommunication by the Pope in 1570 the Queen published the Injunctions in 1571 which forbade anything being taught that \"was contrary to the teaching of the Church Fathers and Catholic Bishops\". This was intended to make clear that the doctrines of the Church of England were in line with Catholic faith as defined by the first four ecumenical councils and such subsequent teaching that conformed to them, and with the teachings Latin and Greek Fathers. The Church of England was the same institution in unbroken continuity but without much of a particular character of its own until the notion of Anglicanism as a distinct \"via media\" between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism emerged late in her reign and more clearly during the reigns of the early Stuart kings. The Church of England was the &lt;a href=\"established%20church\"&gt;established church&lt;/a&gt; (constitutionally established by the state with the head of state as its &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Governor%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England\"&gt;supreme governor&lt;/a&gt;). The exact nature of the relationship between church and state would be a source of continued friction into the next century.\nStuart period.\nFor the next century, through the reigns of &lt;a href=\"James%20VI%20and%20I\"&gt;James I&lt;/a&gt;, who ordered the translation of the Bible known as the King James Version (authorized to be used in parishes which does not mean it was the official version), and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles I&lt;/a&gt;, culminating in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and the Protectorate of &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Cromwell\"&gt;Oliver Cromwell&lt;/a&gt;, there were significant swings back and forth between two factions: the &lt;a href=\"Puritans\"&gt;Puritans&lt;/a&gt; (and other radicals) who sought more far-reaching Protestant reforms, and the more conservative churchmen who aimed to keep closer to traditional beliefs and Catholic practices. The failure of political and ecclesiastical authorities to submit to Puritan demands for more extensive reform was one of the causes of open warfare. By the standards of Continental Europe, the level of violence over religion in England was not high, since the Civil War was mainly about politics, but the casualties included King Charles I and the Archbishop of Canterbury, &lt;a href=\"William%20Laud\"&gt;William Laud&lt;/a&gt; and tens of thousands of civilians who died in the unsettled conditions. Under the Commonwealth and the Protectorate of England from 1649 to 1660, the bishops were dethroned and former practices were outlawed, and &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian%20polity\"&gt;Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt; ecclesiology was introduced in place of the episcopate. The 39 Articles were replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Confession\"&gt;Westminster Confession&lt;/a&gt;, the Book of Common Prayer by the Directory of Public Worship. Despite this, about one quarter of English clergy refused to conform to this form of state &lt;a href=\"presbyterianism\"&gt;presbyterianism&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Restoration of Charles II, Parliament restored the Church of England to a form not far removed from the Elizabethan version. One difference was that the ideal of encompassing all the people of England in one religious organisation, taken for granted by the Tudors, had to be abandoned. The religious landscape of England assumed its present form, with the Anglican established church occupying the middle ground, and those Puritans and Protestants who &lt;a href=\"English%20Dissenters\"&gt;dissented&lt;/a&gt; from the Anglican establishment having to continue their existence outside the national church rather than trying to influence or trying to gain control of it. One result of the Restoration was the ousting of 2,000 parish ministers who had not been ordained by bishops in the apostolic succession or who had been ordained by ministers in presbyter's orders. Official suspicion and legal restrictions continued well into the 19th century. Roman Catholics, perhaps 5% of the English population (down from 20% in 1600) were grudgingly tolerated, having had little or no official representation after the Pope's excommunication of Queen Elizabeth in 1570, though the Stuarts were sympathetic to them. By the end of 18th century they had dwindled to 1% of the population, mostly amongst upper middle-class gentry, their tenants and extended families.\nUnion with the Church of Ireland.\nBy the Fifth Article of the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Union%201800\"&gt;Union with Ireland 1800&lt;/a&gt;, the Church of England and &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Church of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; were united into \"one Protestant Episcopal church, to be called, the United Church of England and Ireland\". Although \"the continuance and preservation of the said united church ... [was] deemed and taken to be an essential and fundamental part of the union\", the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Church%20Act%201869\"&gt;Irish Church Act 1869&lt;/a&gt; separated the Irish part of the church again and disestablished it, the Act coming into effect on 1 January 1871.\nOverseas developments.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt; expanded, British colonists and colonial administrators took the established church doctrines and practices together with ordained ministry and formed overseas branches of the Church of England. As they developed or, beginning with the United States of America, became sovereign or independent states, many of their churches became separate organisationally but remained linked to the Church of England through the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Communion\"&gt;Anglican Communion&lt;/a&gt;. In the provinces that made up Canada, the church operated as the \"Church of England in Canada\" until 1955 when it became the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Church%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Anglican Church of Canada&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Bermuda, the oldest remaining English colony (now designated a &lt;a href=\"British%20Overseas%20Territory\"&gt;British Overseas Territory&lt;/a&gt;), the first Church of England services were performed by the Reverend Richard Buck, one of the survivors of the 1609 wreck of the \"&lt;a href=\"Sea%20Venture\"&gt;Sea Venture&lt;/a&gt;\" which initiated Bermuda's permanent settlement. The nine parishes of the Church of England in &lt;a href=\"Bermuda\"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;, each with its own church and &lt;a href=\"Glebe\"&gt;glebe land&lt;/a&gt;, rarely had more than a pair of ordained ministers to share between them until the 19th century. From 1825 to 1839, Bermuda's parishes were attached to the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Nova%20Scotia%20and%20Prince%20Edward%20Island\"&gt;See of Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;. Bermuda was then grouped into the new Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda from 1839. In 1879, the Synod of the Church of England in Bermuda was formed. At the same time, a Diocese of Bermuda became separate from the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Newfoundland\"&gt;Diocese of Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;, but both continued to be grouped under the \"Bishop of Newfoundland and Bermuda\" until 1919, when Newfoundland and Bermuda each received its own bishop.\nThe Church of England in Bermuda was renamed in 1978 as the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Church%20of%20Bermuda\"&gt;Anglican Church of Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;, which is an &lt;a href=\"Extra-provincial%20Anglican%20churches\"&gt;extra-provincial diocese&lt;/a&gt;, with both &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20bishop\"&gt;metropolitan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Primate%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;primatial&lt;/a&gt; authority coming directly from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Among its parish churches is &lt;a href=\"St.%20Peter%27s%20Church%2C%20St.%20George%27s\"&gt;St Peter's Church&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"St.%20George%27s%2C%20Bermuda\"&gt;St George's Town&lt;/a&gt;, which is the oldest Anglican church outside of the British Isles, and the oldest Protestant church in the New World.\nThe first Anglican missionaries arrived in Nigeria in 1842. The first Anglican Nigerian was consecrated a bishop in 1864. However, the arrival of a rival group of Anglican missionaries in 1887 led to infighting that slowed the growth. In this large African colony, by 1900 there were only 35,000 Anglicans, about 1/5 of one percent of the population. However, in the late 20th century the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Nigeria\"&gt;Church of Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; became the fastest growing of all Anglican churches, being about 18 percent of the local population by 2000.\nThe Church of England established its presence in Hong Kong and Macau in 1843. In 1951, the Diocese of Hong Kong and Macao became an extra-provincial diocese, and in 1998 it became a province of the Anglican Communion, under the name &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Sheng%20Kung%20Hui\"&gt;Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui&lt;/a&gt;.\n21st century.\nDeposition from holy orders overturned.\nUnder the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Rowan%20Williams\"&gt;Rowan Williams&lt;/a&gt; and with significant pressure from clergy union representatives, the ecclesiastical penalty for convicted felons to be defrocked was set aside from the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Church%20of%20England%20Measures\"&gt;Clergy Discipline Measure 2003&lt;/a&gt;. The clergy union argued that the penalty was unfair to victims of hypothetical miscarriages of criminal justice, because the ecclesiastical penalty is considered irreversible. Although clerics can still be banned for life from ministry, they remain ordained as priests.\nContinued decline in attendance and church response.\nBishop &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Mullally\"&gt;Sarah Mullally&lt;/a&gt; has insisted that declining numbers at services should not necessarily be a cause of despair for churches, because people may still encounter God without attending a service in a church; for example hearing the Christian message through social media sites or in a caf\u00e9 run as a community project. Additionally, 9.7\u00a0million people visit at least one of its churches every year and 1\u00a0million students are educated at Church of England schools (which number 4,700). In 2019, an estimated 10 million people visited a cathedral and an additional \"1.3 million people visited Westminster Abbey, where 99% of visitors paid / donated for entry\". Nevertheless, the archbishops of &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Welby\"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Sentamu\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt; warned in January 2015 that the Church of England would no longer be able to carry on in its current form unless the downward spiral in membership were somehow to be reversed, as typical Sunday attendance had halved to 800,000 in the previous 40 years:\nBetween 1969 and 2010, almost 1,800 church buildings, roughly 11% of the stock, were closed (so-called \"&lt;a href=\"redundant%20churches\"&gt;redundant churches&lt;/a&gt;\"); the majority (70%) in the first half of the period; only 514 being closed between 1990 and 2010. Some active use was being made of about half of the closed churches. By 2019 the rate of closure had steadied at around 20 to 25 per year (0.2%); some being replaced by new places of worship. Additionally, in 2018 the church announced a \u00a327\u00a0million growth programme to create 100 new churches.\nLow salaries.\nIn 2015 the Church of England admitted that it was embarrassed to be paying staff under the living wage. The Church of England had previously campaigned for all employers to pay this minimum amount. The archbishop of Canterbury acknowledged it was not the only area where the church \"fell short of its standards\".\nDoctrine and practice.\nThe &lt;a href=\"canon%20law\"&gt;canon law&lt;/a&gt; of the Church of England identifies the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Christian scriptures&lt;/a&gt; as the source of its doctrine. In addition, doctrine is also derived from the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20Fathers\"&gt;Church Fathers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ecumenical%20councils\"&gt;ecumenical councils&lt;/a&gt; (as well as the &lt;a href=\"ecumenical%20creeds\"&gt;ecumenical creeds&lt;/a&gt;) in so far as these agree with scripture. This doctrine is expressed in the &lt;a href=\"Thirty-Nine%20Articles%20of%20Religion\"&gt;Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer\"&gt;Book of Common Prayer&lt;/a&gt;, and the Ordinal containing the rites for the ordination of &lt;a href=\"deacon%23Anglicanism\"&gt;deacons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20priest\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt;, and the consecration of bishops. Unlike other traditions, the Church of England has no single theologian that it can look to as a founder. However, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Hooker\"&gt;Richard Hooker&lt;/a&gt;'s appeal to scripture, &lt;a href=\"Christian%20tradition\"&gt;church tradition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"reason\"&gt;reason&lt;/a&gt; as sources of authority, as well as the work of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Cranmer\"&gt;Thomas Cranmer&lt;/a&gt;, which inspired the doctrinal status of the church, continue to inform Anglican identity.\nThe Church of England's doctrinal character today is largely the result of the Elizabethan Settlement, which sought to establish a comprehensive middle way between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. The Church of England affirms the protestant reformation principle that scripture contains all things necessary to salvation and is the final arbiter in doctrinal matters. The Thirty-nine Articles are the church's only official confessional statement. Though not a complete system of doctrine, the articles highlight areas of agreement with &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calvinism\"&gt;Reformed&lt;/a&gt; positions, while differentiating Anglicanism from Roman Catholicism and &lt;a href=\"Anabaptism\"&gt;Anabaptism&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile embracing some themes of the Protestant Reformation, the Church of England also maintains Catholic traditions of the ancient church and teachings of the Church Fathers, unless these are considered contrary to scripture. It accepts the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils concerning the &lt;a href=\"Trinity\"&gt;Trinity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Incarnation%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;Incarnation&lt;/a&gt;. The Church of England also preserves catholic order by adhering to &lt;a href=\"episcopal%20polity\"&gt;episcopal polity&lt;/a&gt;, with ordained orders of bishops, priests and deacons. There are differences of opinion within the Church of England over the necessity of episcopacy. Some consider it essential, while others feel it is needed for the proper ordering of the church. In sum these express the 'Via Media' viewpoint that the first five centuries of doctrinal development and church order as approved are acceptable as a yardstick by which to gauge authentic catholicity, as minimum and sufficient; Anglicanism did not emerge as the result of charismatic leaders with particular doctrines. It is light on details compared to Roman Catholic, Reformed and Lutheran teachings. The Bible, the Creeds, Apostolic Order, and the administration of the Sacraments are sufficient to establish catholicity. The Reformation in England was initially much concerned about doctrine but the Elizabethan Settlement tried to put a stop to doctrinal contentions. The proponents of further changes, nonetheless, tried to get their way by making changes in Church Order (abolition of bishops), governance (Canon Law) and liturgy ('too Catholic'). They did not succeed because the monarchy and the Church resisted and the majority of the population were indifferent. Moreover, \"despite all the assumptions of the Reformation founders of that Church, it had retained a catholic character.\" The Elizabethan Settlement had created a cuckoo in a nest...\" a Protestant theology and program within a largely pre-Reformation Catholic structure whose continuing life would arouse a theological interest in the Catholicism that had created it; and would result in the rejection of &lt;a href=\"predestinarian\"&gt;predestinarian&lt;/a&gt; theology in favor of sacraments, especially the eucharist, ceremonial, and anti-Calvinist doctrine\" (ibid pp.\u00a078\u201386). The existence of cathedrals \"without substantial alteration\" and \"where the \"old devotional world cast its longest shadow for the future of the ethos that would become Anglicanism,\" p.\u00a079. This is \"One of the great mysteries of the English Reformation,\" ibid that there was no complete break with the past but a muddle that was per force turned into a virtue. The story of the English Reformation is the tale of retreat from the Protestant advance of 1550 which could not proceed further in the face of the opposition of the institution which was rooted in the medieval past, ibid. p.\u00a0142 and the adamant opposition of Queen Elizabeth I.\nThe Church of England has, as one of its distinguishing marks, a breadth and \"open-mindedness\". This tolerance has allowed Anglicans who emphasise the catholic tradition and others who emphasise the reformed tradition to coexist. The three \"parties\" (see &lt;a href=\"churchmanship\"&gt;churchmanship&lt;/a&gt;) in the Church of England are sometimes called &lt;a href=\"high%20church\"&gt;high church&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Catholic\"&gt;Anglo-Catholic&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"low%20church\"&gt;low church&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"evangelical%20Anglican\"&gt;evangelical Anglican&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"broad%20church\"&gt;broad church&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Christianity\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt;). The high church party places importance on the Church of England's continuity with the pre-Reformation Catholic Church, adherence to ancient liturgical usages and the sacerdotal nature of the priesthood. As their name suggests, Anglo-Catholics maintain many traditional catholic practices and liturgical forms. The low church party is more Protestant in both ceremony and theology. Historically, the term 'broad church' has been used to describe those of middle-of-the-road ceremonial preferences who lean theologically towards liberal protestantism. The balance between these strands of churchmanship is not static: in 2013, 40% of Church of England worshippers attended evangelical churches (compared with 26% in 1989), and 83% of very large congregations were evangelical. Such churches were also reported to attract higher numbers of men and young adults than others.\nWorship and liturgy.\nThe Church of England's official book of liturgy as established in English Law is the Book of Common Prayer (BCP). In addition to this book the General Synod has also legislated for a modern &lt;a href=\"liturgical%20book\"&gt;liturgical book&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Common%20Worship\"&gt;Common Worship&lt;/a&gt;\", dating from 2000, which can be used as an alternative to the BCP. Like its predecessor, the 1980 \"&lt;a href=\"Alternative%20Service%20Book\"&gt;Alternative Service Book&lt;/a&gt;\", it differs from the \"Book of Common Prayer\" in providing a range of alternative services, mostly in modern language, although it does include some BCP-based forms as well, for example Order Two for Holy Communion. (This is a revision of the BCP service, altering some words and allowing the insertion of some other liturgical texts such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Agnus%20Dei%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;Agnus Dei&lt;/a&gt;\" before communion.) The Order One rite follows the pattern of more modern liturgical scholarship.\nThe liturgies are organised according to the traditional &lt;a href=\"liturgical%20year\"&gt;liturgical year&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20of%20saints%20%28Church%20of%20England%29\"&gt;calendar of saints&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20sacraments\"&gt;sacraments&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"baptism\"&gt;baptism&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"eucharist\"&gt;eucharist&lt;/a&gt; are generally thought necessary to salvation. &lt;a href=\"Infant%20baptism\"&gt;Infant baptism&lt;/a&gt; is practised. At a later age, individuals baptised as infants receive &lt;a href=\"confirmation\"&gt;confirmation&lt;/a&gt; by a bishop, at which time they reaffirm the baptismal promises made by their parents or sponsors. The eucharist, consecrated by a thanksgiving prayer including Christ's &lt;a href=\"Words%20of%20Institution\"&gt;Words of Institution&lt;/a&gt;, is believed to be \"a memorial of Christ's once-for-all redemptive acts in which Christ is objectively present and effectually received in faith\".\nThe use of hymns and &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20church%20music\"&gt;music in the Church of England&lt;/a&gt; has changed dramatically over the centuries. Traditional &lt;a href=\"Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29\"&gt;Choral evensong&lt;/a&gt; is a staple of most cathedrals. The style of &lt;a href=\"psalm\"&gt;psalm&lt;/a&gt; chanting harks back to the Church of England's pre-reformation roots. During the 18th century, clergy such as &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Wesley\"&gt;Charles Wesley&lt;/a&gt; introduced their own styles of worship with poetic hymns.\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Charismatic%20Movement\"&gt;Charismatic Movement&lt;/a&gt; significantly altered the worship traditions of numerous Church of England parishes, primarily affecting those of &lt;a href=\"evangelical\"&gt;evangelical&lt;/a&gt; persuasion. These churches now adopt a &lt;a href=\"contemporary%20worship\"&gt;contemporary worship&lt;/a&gt; form of service, with minimal liturgical or ritual elements, and incorporating &lt;a href=\"contemporary%20worship%20music\"&gt;contemporary worship music&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust as the Church of England has a large conservative or \"traditionalist\" wing, it also has many &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Christianity\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; members and clergy. Approximately one third of clergy \"doubt or disbelieve in the physical resurrection\". Others, such as the Revd &lt;a href=\"Giles%20Fraser\"&gt;Giles Fraser&lt;/a&gt;, a contributor to \"The Guardian\", have argued for an allegorical interpretation of the &lt;a href=\"virgin%20birth%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;virgin birth of Jesus&lt;/a&gt;. \"The Independent\" reported in 2014 that, according to a YouGov survey of Church of England clergy, \"as many as 16 per cent are unclear about God and two per cent think it is no more than a human construct.\" Moreover, many congregations are seeker-friendly environments. For example, one report from the &lt;a href=\"Church%20Mission%20Society\"&gt;Church Mission Society&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the church open up \"a pagan church where Christianity [is] very much in the centre\" to reach out to spiritual people.\nWomen's ministry.\nWomen were appointed as deaconesses from 1861, but they could not function fully as deacons and were not considered ordained clergy. Women have historically been able to serve as &lt;a href=\"lay%20reader\"&gt;lay reader&lt;/a&gt;s. During the First World War, some women were appointed as lay readers, known as \"&lt;a href=\"bishop%27s%20messenger\"&gt;bishop's messenger&lt;/a&gt;s\", who also led missions and ran churches in the absence of men. After the war, no women were appointed as lay readers until 1969.\nLegislation authorising the ordination of women as deacons was passed in 1986 and they were first ordained in 1987. The &lt;a href=\"ordination%20of%20women\"&gt;ordination of women&lt;/a&gt; as priests was approved by the &lt;a href=\"General%20Synod%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England\"&gt;General Synod&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20the%20first%2032%20women%20ordained%20as%20Church%20of%20England%20priests\"&gt;began in 1994&lt;/a&gt;. In 2010, for the first time in the history of the Church of England, more women than men were ordained as priests (290 women and 273 men), but in the next two years, ordinations of men again exceeded those of women.\nIn July 2005, the synod voted to \"set in train\" the process of allowing the consecration of women as bishops. In February 2006, the synod voted overwhelmingly for the \"further exploration\" of possible arrangements for parishes that did not want to be directly under the authority of a bishop who is a woman. On 7 July 2008, the synod voted to approve the ordination of women as bishops and rejected moves for alternative episcopal oversight for those who do not accept the ministry of bishops who are women. Actual ordinations of women to the episcopate required further legislation, which was narrowly rejected in a General Synod vote in November 2012. On 20 November 2013, the General Synod voted overwhelmingly in support of a plan to allow the ordination of women as bishops, with 378 in favour, 8 against and 25 abstentions.\nOn 14 July 2014, the General Synod approved the ordination of women as bishops. The House of Bishops recorded 37 votes in favour, two against with one abstention. The House of Clergy had 162 in favour, 25 against and four abstentions. The House of Laity voted 152 for, 45 against with five abstentions. This legislation had to be approved by the Ecclesiastical Committee of the Parliament before it could be finally implemented at the November 2014 synod. In December 2014, &lt;a href=\"Libby%20Lane\"&gt;Libby Lane&lt;/a&gt; was announced as the first woman to become a bishop in the Church of England. She was consecrated as a bishop in January 2015. In July 2015, &lt;a href=\"Rachel%20Treweek\"&gt;Rachel Treweek&lt;/a&gt; was the first woman to become a diocesan bishop in the Church of England when she became the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Gloucester\"&gt;Bishop of Gloucester&lt;/a&gt;. She and &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Mullally\"&gt;Sarah Mullally&lt;/a&gt;, Bishop of Crediton, were the first women to be ordained as bishops at &lt;a href=\"Canterbury%20Cathedral\"&gt;Canterbury Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Treweek later made headlines by calling for gender-inclusive language, saying that \"God is not to be seen as male. God is God.\"\nIn May 2018, the Diocese of London consecrated &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Sarah%20Mullally\"&gt;Dame Sarah Mullally&lt;/a&gt; as the first woman to serve as the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20London\"&gt;Bishop of London&lt;/a&gt;. Bishop Sarah Mullally occupies the third most senior position in the Church of England. Mullally has described herself as a feminist and will ordain both men and women to the priesthood. She is also considered by some to be a theological liberal. On women's &lt;a href=\"reproductive%20rights\"&gt;reproductive rights&lt;/a&gt;, Mullally describes herself as &lt;a href=\"Abortion-rights%20movements\"&gt;pro-choice&lt;/a&gt; while also being personally &lt;a href=\"Anti-abortion%20movements\"&gt;pro-life&lt;/a&gt;. On marriage, she supports the current stance of the Church of England that marriage is between a man and a woman, but also said that: \"It is a time for us to reflect on our tradition and scripture, and together say how we can offer a response that is about it being inclusive love.\"\nSame-sex unions and LGBT clergy.\nThe Church of England has been discussing &lt;a href=\"Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;same-sex marriages&lt;/a&gt; and LGBT clergy. The church plans to discuss the issue and decide on whether to perform or bless same-sex marriages in 2022 at the &lt;a href=\"General%20Synod%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England\"&gt;General Synod&lt;/a&gt;. The church holds that marriage is a union of one man with one woman. However, the church teaches \"Same-sex relationships often embody genuine mutuality and fidelity.\" The church also officially supports &lt;a href=\"Celibacy\"&gt;celibate&lt;/a&gt; civil partnerships; \"We believe that Civil Partnerships still have a place, including for some Christian &lt;a href=\"Intersex%20and%20LGBT\"&gt;LGBTI&lt;/a&gt; couples who see them as a way of gaining legal recognition of their relationship.\" The \"Church of England does not conduct Civil Partnership Ceremonies or Same Sex Marriages but individual churches can conduct a service of thanksgiving after a ceremony.\" The church says \"clergy in the Church of England are permitted to offer prayers of support on a pastoral basis for people in same-sex relationships;\" As such, many Anglican churches, with clergy open to it, \"already bless same-sex couples on an unofficial basis.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Civil%20partnership%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Civil partnerships&lt;/a&gt; for clergy have been allowed since 2005, so long as they remain sexually abstinent, and the church extends pensions to clergy in same-sex civil partnerships. In a missive to clergy, the church communicated that \"there was a need for committed same-sex couples to be given recognition and 'compassionate attention' from the Church, including special prayers.\" \"There is no prohibition on prayers being said in church or there being a 'service'\" after a civil union. After same-sex marriage was legalised, the church sought continued availability of civil unions, saying \"The Church of England recognises that same-sex relationships often embody fidelity and mutuality. Civil partnerships enable these Christian virtues to be recognised socially and legally in a proper framework.\"\nIn 2014, the bishops released guidelines that permit \"more informal kind of prayer\" for couples. In the guidelines, \"gay couples who get married will be able to ask for special prayers in the Church of England after their wedding, the bishops have agreed.\" In 2016, The Bishop of Grantham, the Rt Revd &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Chamberlain\"&gt;Nicholas Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt;, announced that he is gay, in a same-sex relationship and celibate, becoming the first bishop to do so in the church. The church had decided in 2013 that gay clergy in civil partnerships so long as they remain sexually abstinent could become bishops. \"The House [of Bishops] has confirmed that clergy in civil partnerships, and living in accordance with the teaching of the church on human sexuality, can be considered as candidates for the episcopate.\"\nIn 2017, the House of Clergy voted against the motion to \"take note\" of the bishops' report defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Due to passage in all three houses being required, the motion was rejected. After General Synod rejected the motion, the archbishops of Canterbury and York called for \"radical new Christian inclusion\" that is \"based on good, healthy, flourishing relationships, and in a proper 21st century understanding of being human and of being sexual.\" The church officially opposes \"&lt;a href=\"conversion%20therapy\"&gt;conversion therapy&lt;/a&gt;\", a practice which attempts to change a gay or lesbian person's sexual orientation, calling it unethical and supports the &lt;a href=\"Conversion%20therapy%20ban\"&gt;banning&lt;/a&gt; of \"conversion therapy\" in the UK. The &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Hereford\"&gt;Diocese of Hereford&lt;/a&gt; approved a motion calling for the church \"to create a set of formal services and prayers to bless those who have had a same-sex marriage or civil partnership.\"\nRegarding &lt;a href=\"Christianity%20and%20transgender%20people\"&gt;transgender issues&lt;/a&gt;, the 2017 General Synod voted in favour of a motion saying that transgender people should be \"welcomed and affirmed in their parish church\". The motion also asked the bishops \"to look into special services for transgender people.\" The bishops initially said \"the House notes that the Affirmation of Baptismal Faith, found in \"Common Worship\", is an ideal liturgical rite which trans people can use to mark this moment of personal renewal.\" The Bishops also authorised services of celebration to mark a gender transition that will be included in formal liturgy. Transgender people may marry in the Church of England after legally making a transition. \"Since the &lt;a href=\"Gender%20Recognition%20Act%202004\"&gt;Gender Recognition Act 2004&lt;/a&gt;, trans people legally confirmed in their gender identity under its provisions are able to marry someone of the opposite sex in their parish church.\" The church further decided that same-gender couples may remain married when one spouse experiences &lt;a href=\"Transitioning%20%28transgender%29\"&gt;gender transition&lt;/a&gt; provided that the spouses identified as opposite genders at the time of the marriage. Since 2000, the church has allowed priests to undergo gender transition and remain in office. The church has ordained openly transgender clergy since 2005.\nBioethics issues.\nThe Church of England is generally opposed to abortion but recognises that \"there can be - strictly limited - conditions under which it may be morally preferable to any available alternative\". The church also opposes euthanasia. Its official stance is that \"While acknowledging the complexity of the issues involved in assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia, the Church of England is opposed to any change in the law or in medical practice that would make assisted dying/suicide or voluntary euthanasia permissible in law or acceptable in practice.\" It also states that \"Equally, the Church shares the desire to alleviate physical and psychological suffering, but believes that assisted dying/suicide and voluntary euthanasia are not acceptable means of achieving these laudable goals.\" In 2014, George Carey, a former archbishop of Canterbury, announced that he had changed his stance on euthanasia and now advocated legalising \"assisted dying\". On embryonic stem-cell research, the church has announced \"cautious acceptance to the proposal to produce cytoplasmic hybrid embryos for research\".\nIn the 19th century, English law required the burial of people who had died by suicide to occur only &lt;a href=\"Interments%20%28felo%20de%20se%29%20Act%201882\"&gt;between the hours of 9 p.m. and midnight and without religious rites&lt;/a&gt;. The Church of England permitted the use of alternative burial services for people who had died by suicide. In 2017, the Church of England changed its rules to permit the full, standard Christian burial service regardless of whether a person had died by suicide.\nPoverty.\nChurch Urban Fund.\nThe Church of England set up the &lt;a href=\"Church%20Urban%20Fund\"&gt;Church Urban Fund&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s to tackle poverty and &lt;a href=\"Social%20deprivation\"&gt;deprivation&lt;/a&gt;. It sees poverty as trapping individuals and communities with some people in urgent need, leading to &lt;a href=\"Dependant\"&gt;dependency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"homelessness\"&gt;homelessness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"social%20isolation\"&gt;isolation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"low%20income\"&gt;low income&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mental%20health\"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; problems, &lt;a href=\"social%20exclusion\"&gt;social exclusion&lt;/a&gt; and violence. They feel that poverty reduces confidence and &lt;a href=\"life%20expectancy\"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; and that people born in poor conditions have difficulty escaping their disadvantaged circumstances.\nChild poverty.\nIn parts of &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, Manchester and &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne\"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; two-thirds of babies are born to poverty and have poorer life chances, also a life expectancy 15 years lower than babies born in the best-off fortunate communities.\nAction on hunger.\nMany prominent people in the Church of England have spoken out against poverty and welfare cuts in the United Kingdom. Twenty-seven bishops are among 43 Christian leaders who signed a letter which urged &lt;a href=\"David%20Cameron\"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; to make sure people &lt;a href=\"Poverty%23Hunger\"&gt;have enough to eat&lt;/a&gt;.\nThousands of UK citizens use &lt;a href=\"food%20bank\"&gt;food bank&lt;/a&gt;s. The church's campaign to end hunger considers this \"truly shocking\" and called for a national day of &lt;a href=\"fasting\"&gt;fasting&lt;/a&gt; on 4 April 2014.\nMembership.\n, the Church of England estimated that it had approximately 26\u00a0million &lt;a href=\"baptised\"&gt;baptised&lt;/a&gt; members \u2013 about 47% of the English population. This number has remained consistent since 2001 and was cited again in 2013. According to a study published by the \"Journal of Anglican Studies\", distributed by the \"Cambridge University Press\", the Church of England continues to claim 26 million baptised members, while it also has approximately 1.7 million active baptised members. Due to its status as the &lt;a href=\"state%20religion\"&gt;established&lt;/a&gt; church, in general, anyone may be married, have their children baptised or their funeral in their local &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England%20parish%20church\"&gt;parish church&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whether they are baptised or regular churchgoers.\nBetween 1890 and 2001, &lt;a href=\"church%20attendance\"&gt;churchgoing&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom declined steadily. In the years 1968 to 1999, Anglican Sunday church attendances almost halved, from 3.5 percent of the population to 1.9 per cent. By 2014, Sunday church attendances had declined further to 1.4 per cent of the population. One study published in 2008 suggested that if current trends continued, Sunday attendances could fall to 350,000 in 2030 and 87,800 in 2050.\nIn 2011, the Church of England published statistics showing 1.7\u00a0million people attended at least one of its services each month, a level maintained since the turn of the millennium; approximately one million participated each Sunday and three million took part in a Church of England service on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve. The church also claimed that 30% attended Sunday worship at least once a year; more than 40% attend a wedding in their local church and still more attend a funeral there. Nationally, in 2011 the Church of England baptised one child in ten. In 2015, the church's statistics showed that 2.6\u00a0million people attended a special &lt;a href=\"Advent\"&gt;Advent&lt;/a&gt; service, 2.4\u00a0million attended a &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; service, 1.3\u00a0million attended an &lt;a href=\"Easter\"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt; service, and 980,000 attended service during an average week. In 2016, 2.6\u00a0million people attended a Christmas service, 1.2\u00a0million attended an Easter service, 1.1\u00a0million people attended a service in the Church of England each month, an average of 930,000 people attended a weekly service, an additional 180,000 attended a service for school each week, and an average of 740,000 people attended Sunday service. In 2017 Cathedral statistics showed that a total of 135,000 attended a Christmas service, an increase of 13% and overall Sunday attendance has risen from 7000 in 2000 to 18,000 in 2017 which had increased over the past 10 years. Also in 2017, approximately 1.14\u00a0million people were a part of the regular worshipping community, meaning those attending church once a month or more, 6.8\u00a0million were reached in the Advent campaign, and 2.68\u00a0million people attended a Christmas service, representing a slight increase.\nThe Church of England has 18,000 active ordained clergy and 10,000 licensed lay ministers. In 2009, 491 people were recommended for ordination training, maintaining the level at the turn of the millennium, and 564 new clergy (266 women and 298 men) were ordained. More than half of those ordained (193 men and 116 women) were appointed to full-time paid ministry. In 2011, 504 new clergy were ordained, including 264 to paid ministry, and 349 &lt;a href=\"lay%20reader\"&gt;lay reader&lt;/a&gt;s were admitted to ministry; and the mode age-range of those recommended for ordination training had remained 40\u201349 since 1999.\nStructure.\nArticle XIX ('Of the Church') of the 39 Articles defines the church as follows:\n&lt;a href=\"Monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;The British monarch&lt;/a&gt; has the constitutional title of &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Governor%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Supreme Governor of the Church of England&lt;/a&gt;. The canon law of the Church of England states, \"We acknowledge that the Queen's most excellent Majesty, acting according to the laws of the realm, is the highest power under God in this kingdom, and has supreme authority over all persons in all causes, as well ecclesiastical as civil.\" In practice this power is often exercised through &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; and on the advice of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Church of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Church%20in%20Wales\"&gt;Church in Wales&lt;/a&gt; separated from the Church of England in 1869 and 1920 respectively and are autonomous churches in the Anglican Communion; Scotland's national church, the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Church of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian\"&gt;Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Episcopal%20Church\"&gt;Scottish Episcopal Church&lt;/a&gt; is part of the Anglican Communion.\nIn addition to England, the jurisdiction of the Church of England extends to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Channel%20Islands\"&gt;Channel Islands&lt;/a&gt; and a few parishes in &lt;a href=\"Flintshire\"&gt;Flintshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monmouthshire\"&gt;Monmouthshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Powys\"&gt;Powys&lt;/a&gt; in Wales &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England%20border%20polls%201915%E2%80%931916\"&gt;which voted to remain with the Church of England rather than joining the Church in Wales&lt;/a&gt;. Expatriate congregations on the continent of Europe have become the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Gibraltar%20in%20Europe\"&gt;Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe church is structured as follows (from the lowest level upwards):\nAll rectors and vicars are &lt;a href=\"advowson\"&gt;appointed by patrons&lt;/a&gt;, who may be private individuals, corporate bodies such as cathedrals, colleges or trusts, or by the bishop or directly by the Crown. No clergy can be instituted and inducted into a parish without swearing the Oath of Allegiance to Her Majesty, and taking the Oath of Canonical Obedience \"in all things lawful and honest\" to the bishop. Usually they are instituted to the benefice by the bishop and then inducted by the archdeacon into the possession of the benefice property\u2014church and parsonage. &lt;a href=\"Curate\"&gt;Curate&lt;/a&gt;s (assistant clergy) are appointed by rectors and vicars, or if priests-in-charge by the bishop after consultation with the patron. Cathedral clergy (normally a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20deans%20in%20the%20Church%20of%20England\"&gt;dean&lt;/a&gt; and a varying number of residentiary canons who constitute the cathedral chapter) are appointed either by the Crown, the bishop, or by the dean and chapter themselves. Clergy officiate in a diocese either because they hold office as beneficed clergy or are licensed by the bishop when appointed, or simply with permission.\nPrimates.\nThe most senior bishop of the Church of England is the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20bishop\"&gt;metropolitan&lt;/a&gt; of the southern province of England, the Province of Canterbury. He has the status of Primate of All England. He is the focus of unity for the worldwide Anglican Communion of independent national or regional churches. &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Welby\"&gt;Justin Welby&lt;/a&gt; has been Archbishop of Canterbury since the confirmation of his election on 4 February 2013.\nThe second most senior bishop is the Archbishop of York, who is the metropolitan of the northern province of England, the Province of York. For historical reasons (relating to the time of York's control by the &lt;a href=\"Danelaw\"&gt;Danes&lt;/a&gt;) he is referred to as the Primate of England. &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Cottrell\"&gt;Stephen Cottrell&lt;/a&gt; became Archbishop of York in 2020. The Bishop of London, the Bishop of Durham and the Bishop of Winchester are ranked in the next three positions, insofar as the holders of those sees automatically become members of the House of Lords.\nDiocesan bishops.\nThe process of appointing diocesan bishops is complex, due to historical reasons balancing hierarchy against democracy, and is handled by the &lt;a href=\"Appointment%20of%20Church%20of%20England%20bishops\"&gt;Crown Nominations Committee&lt;/a&gt; which submits names to the Prime Minister (acting on behalf of the Crown) for consideration.\nRepresentative bodies.\nThe Church of England has a legislative body, General Synod. This can create two types of legislation, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Church%20of%20England%20Measures\"&gt;measures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"canon%20law\"&gt;canons&lt;/a&gt;. Measures have to be approved but cannot be amended by the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British Parliament&lt;/a&gt; before receiving the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Assent\"&gt;Royal Assent&lt;/a&gt; and becoming part of the law of England. Although it is the &lt;a href=\"state%20religion\"&gt;established&lt;/a&gt; church in England only, its measures must be approved by both Houses of Parliament including the non-English members. Canons require Royal Licence and Royal Assent, but form the law of the church, rather than the law of the land.\nAnother assembly is the &lt;a href=\"Convocations%20of%20Canterbury%20and%20York\"&gt;Convocation of the English Clergy&lt;/a&gt;, which is older than the General Synod and its predecessor the Church Assembly. By the 1969 Synodical Government Measure almost all of the Convocations' functions were transferred to the General Synod. Additionally, there are &lt;a href=\"Diocesan%20Synod\"&gt;Diocesan Synod&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Deanery%23Anglican%20usage\"&gt;deanery synods&lt;/a&gt;, which are the governing bodies of the divisions of the Church.\nHouse of Lords.\nOf the 42 diocesan &lt;a href=\"archbishop\"&gt;archbishop&lt;/a&gt;s and bishops in the Church of England, 26 are permitted to sit in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lords\"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York automatically have seats, as do the bishops of &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Durham\"&gt;Durham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;Winchester&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining 21 seats are filled in order of seniority by date of &lt;a href=\"consecration\"&gt;consecration&lt;/a&gt;. It may take a diocesan bishop a number of years to reach the House of Lords, at which point he becomes a &lt;a href=\"Lords%20Spiritual\"&gt;Lord Spiritual&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Sodor%20and%20Man\"&gt;Bishop of Sodor and Man&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Gibraltar%20in%20Europe\"&gt;Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe&lt;/a&gt; are not eligible to sit in the House of Lords as their dioceses lie outside the United Kingdom.\nCrown dependencies.\nAlthough they are not part of England or the United Kingdom, the Church of England is also the established church in the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20dependencies\"&gt;Crown dependencies&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jersey\"&gt;Bailiwick of Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bailiwick%20of%20Guernsey\"&gt;Bailiwick of Guernsey&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/a&gt; has its own diocese of &lt;a href=\"Sodor%20and%20Man\"&gt;Sodor and Man&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Sodor%20and%20Man\"&gt;Bishop of Sodor and Man&lt;/a&gt; is an ex officio member of the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Council%20of%20the%20Isle%20of%20Man\"&gt;Legislative Council&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tynwald\"&gt;Tynwald&lt;/a&gt; on the island. The &lt;a href=\"Channel%20Islands\"&gt;Channel Islands&lt;/a&gt; are part of the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Winchester\"&gt;Diocese of Winchester&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Jersey\"&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Dean%20of%20Jersey\"&gt;Dean of Jersey&lt;/a&gt; is a non-voting member of the &lt;a href=\"States%20of%20Jersey\"&gt;States of Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Guernsey\"&gt;Guernsey&lt;/a&gt; the Church of England is the &lt;a href=\"State%20religion\"&gt;Established Church&lt;/a&gt;, although the &lt;a href=\"Dean%20of%20Guernsey\"&gt;Dean of Guernsey&lt;/a&gt; is not a member of the &lt;a href=\"States%20of%20Guernsey\"&gt;States of Guernsey&lt;/a&gt;.\nSex abuse.\nThere have been many cases of sexual abuse within the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Church\"&gt;Anglican Church&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Church%20in%20Wales\"&gt;Church in Wales&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Anglican%20Communion%20sexual%20abuse%20cases%23Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 2020 report from the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Inquiry%20into%20Child%20Sexual%20Abuse\"&gt;Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse&lt;/a&gt; concluded that the Church of England did not protect children from sexual abuse, and allowed abusers to hide. The Church spent more effort defending alleged abusers rather than supporting victims or protecting children and young people. Allegations were not taken seriously, and in some cases clergymen were ordained even with a history of child sex abuse.\nDespite assurances from senior church leadership there is concern that not enough may be done and historic abuse may still sometimes be covered up. &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Porteous%20Wood\"&gt;Keith Porteous Wood&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Secular%20Society\"&gt;National Secular Society&lt;/a&gt; stated:\nBishop &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Ball%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;Peter Ball&lt;/a&gt; was convicted in October 2015 on several charges of &lt;a href=\"indecent%20assault\"&gt;indecent assault&lt;/a&gt; against young adult men. There are allegations of large-scale earlier cover-ups involving many British establishment figures which prevented Ball's earlier prosecution. There have also been allegations of &lt;a href=\"child%20sex%20abuse\"&gt;child sex abuse&lt;/a&gt;, for example &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Waddington%23Child%20abuse\"&gt;Robert Waddington&lt;/a&gt;. A complainant, known only as \"Joe\", tried for decades to have action taken over sadistic sex abuse which Garth Moore perpetrated against him in 1976 when \"Joe\" was 15 years old. None of the high ranking clergy who \"Joe\" spoke to recall being told about the abuse, which \"Joe\" considers incredible. A representative of the solicitors firm representing \"Joe\" said: \nFunding and finances.\nAlthough an established church, the Church of England does not receive any direct government support. Donations comprise its largest source of income, and it also relies heavily on the income from its various historic endowments. In 2005, the Church of England had estimated total outgoings of around \u00a3900\u00a0million.\nThe Church of England manages an &lt;a href=\"investment%20portfolio\"&gt;investment portfolio&lt;/a&gt; which is worth more than \u00a38\u00a0billion.\nOnline church directories.\nThe Church of England runs \"A Church Near You\", an online directory of churches. A user-edited resource, it currently lists more than 16,000 churches and has 20,000 editors in 42 dioceses. The directory enables parishes to maintain accurate location, contact and event information, which is shared with other websites and &lt;a href=\"mobile%20app\"&gt;mobile app&lt;/a&gt;s. The site allows the public to find their local worshipping community, and offers churches free resources, such as hymns, videos and social media graphics.\nThe \"Church Heritage Record\" includes information on over 16,000 church buildings, including architectural history, archaeology, art history, and the surrounding natural environment. It can be searched by elements including church name, diocese, date of construction, footprint size, &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listing grade&lt;/a&gt;, and church type. The types of church identified include:"
