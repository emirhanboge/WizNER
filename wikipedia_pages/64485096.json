    "text": "The Chadian\u2013Nigerian War was a brief and obscure war that was fought over the control of islands on &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Chad\"&gt;Lake Chad&lt;/a&gt;. The war started when a force led by Chadian Army chief-of-staff &lt;a href=\"Idriss%20D%C3%A9by\"&gt;Idriss D\u00e9by&lt;/a&gt; invaded parts of Nigeria's &lt;a href=\"Borno%20State\"&gt;Borno State&lt;/a&gt;, and ended with a Nigerian force led by &lt;a href=\"Muhammadu%20Buhari\"&gt;Muhammadu Buhari&lt;/a&gt; expelling the Chadians and briefly invading Chadian territory.\nThe war.\nThe war occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Chadian%E2%80%93Libyan%20conflict\"&gt;Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict&lt;/a&gt;, and shortly after Chad had experienced a civil war in which Nigerian peacekeepers had found themselves caught in the crossfire. Further complicating Chadian-Nigerian relations were territorial disputes around &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Chad\"&gt;Lake Chad&lt;/a&gt;, which had long been a source of tensions.\nOn April 18, 1983, a Chadian force invaded and occupied 19 islands on Lake Chad. Acting independently of the Nigerian government, &lt;a href=\"Muhammadu%20Buhari\"&gt;Muhammadu Buhari&lt;/a&gt;, General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the Third Armoured Division of &lt;a href=\"Jos\"&gt;Jos&lt;/a&gt;, unilaterally closed the Chadian-Nigerian border and mobilized his forces. The Nigerian government under President &lt;a href=\"Shehu%20Shagari\"&gt;Shehu Shagari&lt;/a&gt; ordered Buhari to reopen the border, but he openly refused, opting to expel the Chadian troops without the blessings of the government. The Nigerian troops successfully recaptured the islands, and also pursued the Chadians 50 kilometers across the borders.\nAftermath.\nThe war was one of the causes behind the &lt;a href=\"1983%20Nigerian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;1983 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;. Demonstrating President Shagari's powerlessness vis-\u00e0-vis his officers, which had enabled Buhari to openly act against orders, it highlighted the tensions between the military and the civilian government. On December 31, 1983, Muhammadu Buhari seized power in Nigeria, ending the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Nigerian%20Republic\"&gt;Second Nigerian Republic&lt;/a&gt;."
