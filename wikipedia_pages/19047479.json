    "text": "Anthony Peter Anglesea (born 30 October 1971 in &lt;a href=\"Blackrod\"&gt;Blackrod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, England) was a &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; footballer who played back row and second for the &lt;a href=\"Sale%20Sharks\"&gt;Sale Sharks&lt;/a&gt;. Highly regarded by Sale when forced to retire through injury in 2006, he first took a role within the community team at Sale and is now part of the coaching set up. Anglesea also helps with coaching at Sale FC and Fylde rugby clubs.\nNever capped at full international level, he did captain the England A &lt;a href=\"Churchill%20Cup\"&gt;Churchill Cup&lt;/a&gt; team in 2003. Anglesea was called up to the senior &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; squad for the &lt;a href=\"2002%20England%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Argentina\"&gt;2002 tour of Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnglesea's club highlight is probably his \"Man of the Match\" performance in Sale's Parker Pen European Shield final win over Pontypridd in 2002. He was selected as club captain for the 2003-04 season and was a member of Sale's &lt;a href=\"Guinness%20Premiership\"&gt;Guinness Premiership&lt;/a&gt; winning squad in 2005-06.\nIn December 2010, Anglesea took over as head coach for the remainder of the 2010/11 season. The previous coach, &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Brewer%20%28rugby%20player%29\"&gt;Mike Brewer&lt;/a&gt;, was sacked after Sale won just three of their first nine games of the season."
