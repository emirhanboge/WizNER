    "text": "Carl Stenborg (8 September 1752 \u2013 1 August 1813) was a Swedish &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; singer, composer and theatre director. He belonged to the pioneer generation of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swedish%20Opera\"&gt;Royal Swedish Opera&lt;/a&gt; and was regarded as one of the leading opera singers of the &lt;a href=\"Gustavian%20era\"&gt;Gustavian era&lt;/a&gt;. He was a \"&lt;a href=\"hovs%C3%A5ngare\"&gt;hovs\u00e5ngare&lt;/a&gt;\" and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Music\"&gt;Royal Swedish Academy of Music&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nCarl Stenborg was born in &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; to actor &lt;a href=\"Petter%20Stenborg\"&gt;Petter Stenborg&lt;/a&gt; (1719\u20131781), director of the &lt;a href=\"Stenborg%20Troupe\"&gt;Stenborg Troupe&lt;/a&gt;, and Anna Kr\u00fcger (1710\u20131803). Of his brothers, Johan Fredrik Stenborg (1743\u20131813) studied at &lt;a href=\"Uppsala%20University\"&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/a&gt; and became an official, and Nils Stenborg (d. 1780) became an opera singer. \nHe received a good education, debuted as a concert singer in &lt;a href=\"Riddarhuset\"&gt;Riddarhuset&lt;/a&gt; in 1766 and was appointed councillor at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Court%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Royal Court of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; in 1767. This was considered unusual, since his father was not of wealthy means. Carl's mother had been the housekeeper of the nobleman and statesman &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Horn\"&gt;Adam Horn&lt;/a&gt; (1717-1778). Carl or one of his brothers may have been his son, which was to be the reason why the sons of a poor man had been able to receive such a good education and reach high positions so early in life.\nRoyal Opera.\nWhen the Royal Swedish Opera was founded in 1773, he played the main male role in &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Uttini\"&gt;Francesco Uttini&lt;/a&gt;'s opera \"&lt;a href=\"Thetis%20och%20P%C3%A9l%C3%A9e\"&gt;Thetis och P\u00e9l\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;\" opposite the primadonna &lt;a href=\"Elisabeth%20Olin\"&gt;Elisabeth Olin&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he had a relationship. He was the leading male star for several years and in 1780 was given a life contract. Although he sang &lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt; roles, his voice was known for its dexterity and dark &lt;a href=\"timbre\"&gt;timbre&lt;/a&gt; and was nearer to that of a &lt;a href=\"baritone\"&gt;baritone&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarl Stenborg was appointed &lt;a href=\"Hovs%C3%A5ngare\"&gt;Hovs\u00e5ngare&lt;/a&gt; in 1773, royal secretary in 1782 and was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Music\"&gt;Royal Swedish Academy of Music&lt;/a&gt; in 1783.\nThe Stenborg theaters.\nHe was the director of his father's theatres in 1780\u201399: from 1788, he was allowed to perform in them. He was engaged in 1782 and in 1793 he married the singer Betty Olin, daughter of Elisabeth Olin, and performed with her in &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; in 1794 and 1795. The engagement had been long because of the unwillingness of Elisabeth Olin to give her consent to the marriage between her daughter and her own former lover.\nIn 1784 Stenborg's &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; \"Gustaf Ericsson i Dalarna\" premiered at one of his father's theaters. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Stenborg%20Theatre\"&gt;Stenborg Theatre&lt;/a&gt; was closed in 1799, he toured the country (1804\u201309) with his own company.\nLater life.\nHe was given a pension in 1806.\nHe gave his last performance at a concert on &lt;a href=\"Riddarhuset\"&gt;Riddarhuset&lt;/a&gt; 27 February 1808, \"to the great surprise of everyone\" opposite Elisabeth Olin, which now also gave her last performance, and &lt;a href=\"Jeanette%20W%C3%A4sselius\"&gt;Jeanette W\u00e4sselius&lt;/a&gt;, with music of the royal chapel, &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Christian%20Friedrich%20H%C3%A6ffner\"&gt;Johann Christian Friedrich H\u00e6ffner&lt;/a&gt;, Freidrich M\u00fcller and his own daughter, the pianist Carolina Stenborg (1798\u20131869).\nHe died in Stockholm on 1 August 1813."
