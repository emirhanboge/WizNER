The &lt;a href=\"transmitter\"&gt;transmitter&lt;/a&gt; is off Gibraltar Road in Santa Barbara, located among the &lt;a href=\"radio%20masts%20and%20towers\"&gt;towers&lt;/a&gt; for other Santa Barbara FM and TV stations.\nHistory.\nBeautiful and Classical Music.\nKDB-FM first &lt;a href=\"sign-on\"&gt;signed on&lt;/a&gt; the air on . It was the &lt;a href=\"sister%20station\"&gt;sister station&lt;/a&gt; to KDB &lt;a href=\"1490%20AM\"&gt;1490 AM&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"KOSJ\"&gt;KOSJ&lt;/a&gt;). The AM station went on the air in 1925, an era where many stations were granted three-letter &lt;a href=\"call%20sign\"&gt;call sign&lt;/a&gt;s. This is why today's KDB still retains unusual call letters for an FM station. KDB-AM-FM were Santa Barbara's first 24-hour stations. The stations were bought in 1971 by the Pacific Broadcasting Company, consisting of Bob Scott, Harvey Pool, and Dick Marsh. After programming American &lt;a href=\"show%20tune\"&gt;show tune&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"beautiful%20music\"&gt;beautiful music&lt;/a&gt; for nine years, KDB-FM changed its format to &lt;a href=\"classical%20music\"&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt; in 1980.\nA competing classical music station appeared in Santa Barbara in 1985. Signing on that year was KSCA, a full-power &lt;a href=\"Non-commercial%20educational\"&gt;non-commercial&lt;/a&gt; station owned by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20California\"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; that served as a repeater of &lt;a href=\"KUSC\"&gt;KUSC&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles. KSCA's call letters changed to KFAC in 1991, then to &lt;a href=\"KQSC\"&gt;KQSC&lt;/a&gt; in 2004.\nOwnership Changes.\nThe KDB-AM-FM combo was split in November 1990 due to an ownership dispute. Pacific Broadcasting sold the AM station, then known as KSPE, to Spectacular Broadcasting for $302,000.\nMeanwhile, KDB-FM remained with Bob Scott, his son Roby, and Pool. Through the 1980s and 90s, many commercial classical stations around the U.S. were sold and their formats changed to more mass-appeal musical genres. But a few, like &lt;a href=\"WQXR-FM\"&gt;WQXR-FM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"WCRB\"&gt;WCRB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; were converted to non-profit status.\nNon-Profit Status.\nIn 2001, Michael Towbes, David Anderson, and Jean and Barry Schuyler bought KDB-FM with the goal of selling the station to a &lt;a href=\"nonprofit%20organization\"&gt;nonprofit organization&lt;/a&gt; that would keep the classical format and local orientation. This happened in November 2003, when the Santa Barbara Foundation purchased the station through a generous donation from Towbes.\nIn 2010, KDB embarked on a three-year strategic plan to enhance and grow its service to the community with programming that enriched the lives of those who listen. KDB added a Features Producer who created two to three interviews and features per week on the performing, visual and literary arts, as well as the work of local nonprofit organizations. In 2011, KDB entered the world of social media, adding a monthly e-newsletter and &lt;a href=\"Facebook\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page.\nIn October 2013, the Santa Barbara Foundation announced that it had put KDB up for sale. In a statement, the station said that it was unable to attract enough revenue from contributing listeners to support KDB's operations, despite an increase in membership revenue. The foundation hoped to sell the station at a discount to interests that would retain the classical format, citing the \"continuing community benefit\" of continuing this programming. However, the organization also considered full-price offers from groups that would program a format of their choosing, in which case the proceeds would go toward an endowment to support classical music in the area.\nKCRW and KUSC Ownership.\nIn February 2014, public radio station &lt;a href=\"KCRW\"&gt;KCRW&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Monica%2C%20California\"&gt;Santa Monica, California&lt;/a&gt; announced that it would buy KDB for $1 million; the sale price was amended to $1.3 million in June. The transaction would allow KCRW to shift its Santa Barbara broadcast coverage from a weak &lt;a href=\"FM%20translator\"&gt;FM translator&lt;/a&gt; to the full-powered 88.7 signal then licensed to KQSC. USC moved its classical music programming from 88.7 to KDB's 93.7 frequency, thus continuing KDB's role as Santa Barbara's classical station. On August 28, 2014, the sale was finalized and KDB began simulcasting KUSC's classical format.\nKCRW donated much of the KDB studio equipment to &lt;a href=\"KBUU-LP\"&gt;KBUU-LP&lt;/a&gt;, a startup community radio station in &lt;a href=\"Malibu%2C%20California\"&gt;Malibu&lt;/a&gt;. The vintage 1990 broadcast board remains in continuous use at KBUU, with an old KDB logo and its baton-wielding penguin affixed. ."
