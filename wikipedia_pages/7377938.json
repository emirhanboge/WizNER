    "text": "Ederson Honorato Campos (born 13 January 1986) is a Brazilian former professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; who played as a &lt;a href=\"midfielder\"&gt;midfielder&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nEarly career.\nEderson began his footballing career playing on the streets of &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. When he was 15, he joined Brazilian second tier club RS Futebol. After a year of obscurity, Ederson joined top division side &lt;a href=\"Esporte%20Clube%20Juventude\"&gt;Juventude&lt;/a&gt;, who, at the time, was managed by &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Gomes\"&gt;Ricardo Gomes&lt;/a&gt;, who would go on manage top French clubs &lt;a href=\"FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AS%20Monaco%20FC\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;. Ederson flourished at Juventude. His performances earned him a call up to the &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil under-17 team&lt;/a&gt;, whom he helped win the &lt;a href=\"2003%20FIFA%20U-17%20World%20Championship\"&gt;2003 FIFA U-17 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; held in &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;.\nMove to Europe.\nLike most Brazilian footballers, Ederson's ideal destination was Europe, where he believed he could further his development. In January 2005, Ederson agreed to join French club &lt;a href=\"OGC%20Nice\"&gt;OGC Nice&lt;/a&gt;, initially as a loan, after being approached by then-Nice manager &lt;a href=\"Gernot%20Rohr\"&gt;Gernot Rohr&lt;/a&gt; who scouted the player through videotapes. He made his league debut on 5 February 2005 in a match against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Metz\"&gt;Metz&lt;/a&gt; coming on as a substitute in the 72nd minute. On just his third appearance with the club, he scored his first goal in the 66th minute with an extraordinary shot from almost 45 meters out against nearby rivals &lt;a href=\"AS%20Monaco%20FC\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;. The goal turned out to the game winner as Nice won the match 2\u20131.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201%20season%202005%E2%80%9306\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt;, Ederson was handed the number 10 shirt, but was limited to mostly substitute appearances. He still managed to score two goals in 20 appearances. The &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Ligue%201\"&gt;2006\u201307 season&lt;/a&gt; effectively brought Ederson into the limelight as he made a career-high 30 appearances and scored 6 goals, including a game winning &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty&lt;/a&gt; in the 90th minute against &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20de%20Marseille\"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt; and a brace against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;, though Nice finished in 16th position. Still, his dazzling performances caught the eye of several big clubs, notably &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"S.S.%20Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few.\nFinal season at Nice and Lyon.\nEderson's final season at Nice was his best starting all 36 matches he appeared in and scored 7 goals. In January 2008, Ederson and Nice agreed to a move to French champions &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20Lyonnais\"&gt;Olympique Lyonnais&lt;/a&gt; for a fee of \u20ac14\u00a0million with Nice likely to receive another \u20ac1\u00a0million based on incentives. He allegedly snubbed European heavyweights Manchester United and Real Madrid, according to Lyon chairman &lt;a href=\"Jean-Michel%20Aulas\"&gt;Jean-Michel Aulas&lt;/a&gt;. As per the agreement, Ederson was allowed to finished the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Ligue%201\"&gt;2007\u201308 season&lt;/a&gt; with Nice scoring his 6th and 7th goal on the last two match days of the season.\nHe officially joined Lyon in June 2008 along with Nice teammate &lt;a href=\"Hugo%20Lloris\"&gt;Hugo Lloris&lt;/a&gt;. Considered a perfect replacement for the aging &lt;a href=\"Juninho%20Pernambucano\"&gt;Juninho&lt;/a&gt;, he was given the number 7 shirt and made his debut on the opening day of the season in a 3\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"Toulouse%20FC\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt; coming on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He scored his first goal for Lyon with a penalty kick against &lt;a href=\"Le%20Havre%20AC\"&gt;Le Havre&lt;/a&gt; on 20 September 2008. It was the only goal of the match. In January 2009, he scored in back to back matches against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Lorient\"&gt;Lorient&lt;/a&gt; with another penalty kick and &lt;a href=\"Grenoble%20Foot%2038\"&gt;Grenoble&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared in all eight of Lyon's &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; matches and has been one of Lyon's more consistent players despite playing the majority of matches in the unfamiliar winger position, whilst at Nice, he operated mainly as an attacking midfielder.\nMove to Lazio.\nOn 2 July 2012, Ederson joined &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"S.S.%20Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt; on a five-year contract.\nEderson has had an interrupted preseason with a few minor injuries but has managed to score two goals in 5 appearances for the biancocelesti.\nMove to Flamengo.\nOn 21 July 2015, Ederson joined Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20A\"&gt;S\u00e9rie A&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Clube%20de%20Regatas%20do%20Flamengo\"&gt;Flamengo&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetirement.\nAfter spending more than a year away from the pitch because of persistent knee pains, he announced his retirement on January 1, 2020 in an interview with a television station.\nInternational career.\nAs mentioned, Ederson was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil under-17 team&lt;/a&gt; that won the &lt;a href=\"2003%20FIFA%20U-17%20World%20Championship\"&gt;2003 FIFA U-17 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. \nin 2008 he was included in Brazil's preliminary squad to the 2008 Summer Olympics, however he did not get a place in the final list by coach Dunga.\nOn 26 July 2010, he was called up for the first time to the senior team to participate in the team's August 2010 friendly against the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to representing Brazil, Ederson was also eligible to appear for &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Residency%20%28domicile%29\"&gt;residency rules&lt;/a&gt;. He earned his first cap in a friendly game against the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; but unfortunately after a couple of minutes he got injured and was replaced immediately by &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Eduardo%20Marques\"&gt;Carlos Eduardo&lt;/a&gt;.\nHonours.\nBrazil U-17\nLazio\nFlamengo"
