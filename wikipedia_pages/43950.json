    "text": "The Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, commonly known as the Interstate Highway System, is a network of &lt;a href=\"controlled-access%20highway\"&gt;controlled-access highway&lt;/a&gt;s that forms part of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Highway System&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. The system extends throughout the &lt;a href=\"contiguous%20United%20States\"&gt;contiguous United States&lt;/a&gt; and has routes in &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe U.S. federal government first funded roadways through the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aid%20Road%20Act%20of%201916\"&gt;Federal Aid Road Act of 1916&lt;/a&gt;, and began an effort to construct a national road grid with the passage of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201921\"&gt;Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921&lt;/a&gt;. In 1926, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System\"&gt;United States Numbered Highway System&lt;/a&gt; was established, creating the first national road numbering system for cross-country travel. The roads were still state-funded and maintained, however, and there was little in the way of national standards for road design. U.S. Highways could be anything from a two-lane country road to a major multi-lane freeway.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower\"&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt; became president in 1953, his administration developed a proposal for an interstate highway system, eventually resulting in the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. Unlike the earlier U.S. Highway System, the Interstates were designed to be an all-freeway system, with nationally unified standards for construction and signage. While some older freeways were adopted into the system, most of the routes were completely new construction, greatly expanding the freeway network in the U.S. Especially in densely populated urban areas, these new freeways were often controversial as their building necessitated the destruction of many older, well established neighborhoods; as a result of the many &lt;a href=\"Highway%20revolts%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;freeway revolts&lt;/a&gt; during the 1960s and 1970s, several planned Interstates were abandoned or re-routed to avoid urban cores. Construction of the original Interstate Highway System was proclaimed complete in 1992, despite deviations from the original 1956 plan and several &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20gaps%20in%20Interstate%20Highways\"&gt;stretches that did not fully conform with federal standards&lt;/a&gt;. The cost of construction of the Interstate Highway System was approximately $114\u00a0billion (equivalent to $ in ). The system has continued to expand and grow as additional federal funding has provided for new routes to be added, and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20future%20Interstate%20Highways\"&gt;the system will grow into the future&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough much of their construction was funded by the federal government, Interstate Highways are owned by the state in which they were built. All Interstates must meet &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20Highway%20standards\"&gt;specific standards&lt;/a&gt;, such as having &lt;a href=\"freeway\"&gt;controlled access&lt;/a&gt;, avoiding &lt;a href=\"Intersection%20%28road%29\"&gt;at-grade intersections&lt;/a&gt;, and complying with federal &lt;a href=\"Road%20signs%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;traffic sign&lt;/a&gt; specifications. Interstate Highways use a numbering scheme in which primary Interstates are assigned one- or two-digit numbers, and shorter routes which branch off of longer ones are assigned three-digit numbers where the last two digits match the parent route. The Interstate Highway System is partially financed through the &lt;a href=\"Highway%20Trust%20Fund\"&gt;Highway Trust Fund&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is funded by a federal &lt;a href=\"fuel%20tax\"&gt;fuel tax&lt;/a&gt;. Though federal legislation initially banned the collection of tolls, some Interstate routes are &lt;a href=\"toll%20road\"&gt;toll road&lt;/a&gt;s, either because they were grandfathered into the system or because subsequent legislation has allowed for tolling of Interstates in some cases.\n, about one-quarter of all vehicle miles driven in the country used the Interstate Highway System, which had a total length of .\nHistory.\nPlanning.\nThe United States government's efforts to construct a national network of highways began on an \"ad hoc\" basis with the passage of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aid%20Road%20Act%20of%201916\"&gt;Federal Aid Road Act of 1916&lt;/a&gt;, which provided $75\u00a0million over a five-year period for &lt;a href=\"matching%20funds\"&gt;matching funds&lt;/a&gt; to the states for the construction and improvement of highways. The nation's revenue needs associated with &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; prevented any significant implementation of this policy, which expired in 1921.\nIn December 1918, E. J. Mehren, a civil engineer and the editor of \"&lt;a href=\"Engineering%20News-Record\"&gt;Engineering News-Record&lt;/a&gt;\", presented his \"A Suggested National Highway Policy and Plan\" during a gathering of the State Highway Officials and Highway Industries Association at the Congress Hotel in Chicago. In the plan, Mehren proposed a system, consisting of five east\u2013west routes and 10 north\u2013south routes. The system would include two percent of all roads and would pass through every state at a cost of , providing commercial as well as military transport benefits.\nIn 1919 the U.S. Army sent an expedition across the U.S. to determine the difficulties that military vehicles would have on a cross-country trip. Leaving from the Ellipse near the White House on July 7, the &lt;a href=\"1919%20Motor%20Transport%20Corps%20convoy\"&gt;Motor Transport Corps convoy&lt;/a&gt; needed 62 days to drive on the &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20Highway\"&gt;Lincoln Highway&lt;/a&gt; to the Presidio army base on San Francisco Bay. The convoy suffered many setbacks and problems on the route, such as poor-quality bridges, broken crankshafts, and engines clogged with desert sand.\nDwight Eisenhower, then a 28-year-old &lt;a href=\"Brevet%20%28military%29\"&gt;brevet&lt;/a&gt; lieutenant colonel, accompanied the trip \"through darkest America with truck and tank,\" as he later described it. Some roads in the West were a \"succession of dust, ruts, pits, and holes.\" Eisenhower recalled that, \"The old convoy had started me thinking about good two-lane highways... the wisdom of broader ribbons across our land.\"\nAs the landmark 1916 law expired, new legislation was passed\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201921\"&gt;Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921&lt;/a&gt; (Phipps Act). This new road construction initiative once again provided for federal matching funds for road construction and improvement, $75\u00a0million allocated annually. Moreover, this new legislation for the first time sought to target these funds to the construction of a national road grid of interconnected \"primary highways\", setting up cooperation among the various state highway planning boards.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Highway%20Administration\"&gt;Bureau of Public Roads&lt;/a&gt; asked the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; to provide a list of roads that it considered necessary for national defense. In 1922, General &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Pershing\"&gt;John J. Pershing&lt;/a&gt;, former head of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;American Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; in Europe during the war, complied by submitting a detailed network of of interconnected primary highways\u2014the so-called &lt;a href=\"Pershing%20Map\"&gt;Pershing Map&lt;/a&gt;.\nA boom in road construction followed throughout the decade of the 1920s, with such projects as the &lt;a href=\"Parkways%20in%20New%20York%20State\"&gt;New York parkway system&lt;/a&gt; constructed as part of a new national highway system. As automobile traffic increased, planners saw a need for such an interconnected national system to supplement the existing, largely non-freeway, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways\"&gt;United States Numbered Highways&lt;/a&gt; system. By the late 1930s, planning had expanded to a system of new superhighways.\nIn 1938, President &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Harris%20MacDonald\"&gt;Thomas MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;, chief at the Bureau of Public Roads, a hand-drawn map of the United States marked with eight superhighway corridors for study. In 1939, Bureau of Public Roads Division of Information chief &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20S.%20Fairbank\"&gt;Herbert S. Fairbank&lt;/a&gt; wrote a report called \"Toll Roads and Free Roads\", \"the first formal description of what became the Interstate Highway System\" and, in 1944, the similarly themed \"Interregional Highways\".\nFederal Aid Highway Act of 1956.\nThe Interstate Highway System gained a champion in President &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower\"&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt;, who was influenced by his experiences as a young Army officer crossing the country in the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy that drove in part on the &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20Highway\"&gt;Lincoln Highway&lt;/a&gt;, the first road across America. He recalled that, \"The old convoy had started me thinking about good two-lane highways... the wisdom of broader ribbons across our land.\" Eisenhower also gained an appreciation of the &lt;a href=\"Reichsautobahn\"&gt;Reichsautobahn&lt;/a&gt; system, the first \"national\" implementation of modern &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"German%20autobahns\"&gt;Autobahn&lt;/a&gt; network, as a necessary component of a national defense system while he was serving as &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Commander%20of%20the%20Allied%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Supreme Commander&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied Forces&lt;/a&gt; in Europe during &lt;a href=\"European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. In 1954, Eisenhower appointed General &lt;a href=\"Lucius%20D.%20Clay\"&gt;Lucius D. Clay&lt;/a&gt; to head a committee charged with proposing an interstate highway system plan. Summing up motivations for the construction of such a system, Clay stated,\nClay's committee proposed a 10-year, $100\u00a0billion program, which would build of &lt;a href=\"Dual%20carriageway\"&gt;divided highways&lt;/a&gt; linking all American cities with a population of greater than 50,000. Eisenhower initially preferred a system consisting of &lt;a href=\"toll%20road\"&gt;toll road&lt;/a&gt;s, but Clay convinced Eisenhower that toll roads were not feasible outside of the highly populated coastal regions. In February 1955, Eisenhower forwarded Clay's proposal to Congress. The bill quickly won approval in the Senate, but House Democrats objected to the use of public &lt;a href=\"Bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt; as the means to finance construction. Eisenhower and the House Democrats agreed to instead finance the system through the &lt;a href=\"Highway%20Trust%20Fund\"&gt;Highway Trust Fund&lt;/a&gt;, which itself would be funded by a &lt;a href=\"gasoline\"&gt;gasoline&lt;/a&gt; tax. In June 1956, Eisenhower signed the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201956\"&gt;Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956&lt;/a&gt; into law. Under the act, the federal government would pay for 90 percent of the cost of construction of Interstate Highways. Each Interstate Highway was required to be a &lt;a href=\"freeway\"&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt; with at least four lanes and no at-grade crossings.\nThe publication in 1955 of the \"General Location of National System of Interstate Highways\", informally known as the \"Yellow Book\", mapped out what became the Interstate Highway System. Assisting in the planning was &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Erwin%20Wilson\"&gt;Charles Erwin Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, who was still head of &lt;a href=\"General%20Motors\"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; when President Eisenhower selected him as Secretary of Defense in January 1953.\nConstruction.\nSome sections of highways that became part of the Interstate Highway System actually began construction earlier.\nThree states have claimed the title of first Interstate Highway. Missouri claims that the first three contracts under the new program were signed in Missouri on August 2, 1956. The first contract signed was for upgrading a section of &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2066\"&gt;US Route 66&lt;/a&gt; to what is now designated &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2044\"&gt;Interstate 44&lt;/a&gt;. On August 13, 1956, work began on &lt;a href=\"US%20Route%2040\"&gt;US 40&lt;/a&gt; (now I-70) in St. Charles County.\nKansas claims that it was the first to start paving after the act was signed. Preliminary construction had taken place before the act was signed, and paving started September 26, 1956. The state marked its portion of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2070\"&gt;I-70&lt;/a&gt; as the first project in the United States completed under the provisions of the new Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Turnpike\"&gt;Pennsylvania Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; could also be considered one of the first Interstate Highways, and is nicknamed \"Grandfather of the Interstate System\". On October 1, 1940, of the highway now designated I\u201170 and I\u201176 opened between &lt;a href=\"Irwin%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Irwin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carlisle%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Carlisle&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Commonwealth of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; refers to the turnpike as the Granddaddy of the Pikes (referring to &lt;a href=\"Toll%20road\"&gt;turnpike&lt;/a&gt;s).\nMilestones in the construction of the Interstate Highway System include:\nThe initial cost estimate for the system was $25\u00a0billion over 12\u00a0years; it ended up costing $114\u00a0billion (equivalent to $425\u00a0billion in 2006 or $ in ) and took 35\u00a0years.\n1992\u2013present.\nDiscontinuities.\nThe system was proclaimed complete in 1992, but two of the original Interstates\u2014&lt;a href=\"Interstate%2095\"&gt;I-95&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2070\"&gt;I-70&lt;/a&gt;\u2014were not continuous: both of these discontinuities were due to local opposition, which blocked efforts to build the necessary connections to fully complete the system. I-95 was made a continuous freeway in 2018, and thus I-70 remains the only original Interstate with a discontinuity.\nI-95 was discontinuous in New Jersey because of the cancellation of the &lt;a href=\"Somerset%20Freeway\"&gt;Somerset Freeway&lt;/a&gt;. This situation was remedied when the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Turnpike/Interstate%2095%20Interchange%20Project\"&gt;Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project&lt;/a&gt; started in 2010 and partially opened on September 22, 2018, which was already enough to fill the gap.\nHowever, I-70 remains discontinuous in &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, because of the lack of a direct interchange with the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Turnpike\"&gt;Pennsylvania Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; at the eastern end of the &lt;a href=\"concurrency%20%28road%29\"&gt;concurrency&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Breezewood%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Breezewood&lt;/a&gt;. Traveling in either direction, I-70 traffic must exit the freeway and use a short stretch of &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2030%20in%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;US-30&lt;/a&gt; (which includes a number of roadside services) to rejoin I-70. The interchange was not originally built because of a legacy federal funding rule, since relaxed, which restricted the use of federal funds to improve roads financed with tolls. Solutions have been proposed to eliminate the discontinuity, but they have been blocked by local opposition, fearing a loss of business.\nExpansion.\nThe Interstate Highway System has been expanded numerous times. The expansions have both created new designations and extended existing designations. For example, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2049\"&gt;I-49&lt;/a&gt;, added to the system in the 1980s as a freeway in &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, was designated as an expansion corridor, and FHWA approved the expanded route north from &lt;a href=\"Lafayette%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Lafayette, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Kansas City, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. The freeway exists today as separate completed segments, with segments under construction or in the planning phase between them.\nIn 1966, the FHWA designated the entire Interstate Highway System as part of the larger &lt;a href=\"Pan-American%20Highway\"&gt;Pan-American Highway&lt;/a&gt; System, and at least two proposed Interstate expansions were initiated to help trade with &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; spurred by the &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement\"&gt;North American Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (NAFTA). Long-term plans for &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2069\"&gt;I-69&lt;/a&gt;, which currently exists in several separate completed segments (the largest of which are in &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;), is to have the highway route extend from &lt;a href=\"Tamaulipas\"&gt;Tamaulipas&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico to &lt;a href=\"Ontario\"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. The planned &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2011\"&gt;I-11&lt;/a&gt; will then bridge the Interstate gap between &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Phoenix, Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Las Vegas, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, and thus form part of the &lt;a href=\"CANAMEX%20Corridor\"&gt;CANAMEX Corridor&lt;/a&gt; (along with &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2019\"&gt;I-19&lt;/a&gt;, and portions of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2010\"&gt;I-10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2015\"&gt;I-15&lt;/a&gt;) between &lt;a href=\"Sonora\"&gt;Sonora&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico and &lt;a href=\"Alberta\"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, Canada.\nUrban Interstates abandoned because of local opposition.\nPolitical opposition from residents canceled many freeway projects around the United States, including:\nStandards.\nThe &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20and%20Transportation%20Officials\"&gt;American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials&lt;/a&gt; (AASHTO) has defined a set of standards that all new Interstates must meet unless a waiver from the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Highway%20Administration\"&gt;Federal Highway Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FHWA) is obtained. One almost absolute standard is the &lt;a href=\"controlled-access%20highway\"&gt;controlled access&lt;/a&gt; nature of the roads. With few &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20gaps%20in%20Interstate%20Highways\"&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"traffic%20light\"&gt;traffic light&lt;/a&gt;s (and cross traffic in general) are limited to &lt;a href=\"Toll%20house\"&gt;toll booths&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ramp%20meter\"&gt;ramp meter&lt;/a&gt;s (metered flow control for lane merging during &lt;a href=\"rush%20hour\"&gt;rush hour&lt;/a&gt;).\nSpeed limits.\nBeing &lt;a href=\"freeway\"&gt;freeway&lt;/a&gt;s, Interstate Highways usually have the highest &lt;a href=\"speed%20limit\"&gt;speed limit&lt;/a&gt;s in a given area. Speed limits are determined by individual states. From 1975 to 1986, the maximum speed limit on any highway in the United States was , in accordance with federal law.\nTypically, lower limits are established in &lt;a href=\"Northeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;Northeastern&lt;/a&gt; and coastal states, while higher speed limits are established in inland states west of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;. For example, the maximum speed limit is in northern Maine, varies between from southern Maine to New Jersey, and is in New York City and the District of Columbia. Currently, rural speed limits elsewhere generally range from . Several portions of various highways such as &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2010%20in%20Texas\"&gt;I-10&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2020%20in%20Texas\"&gt;I-20&lt;/a&gt; in rural western Texas, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2080%20in%20Nevada\"&gt;I-80&lt;/a&gt; in Nevada between Fernley and Winnemucca (except around Lovelock) and portions of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2015%20in%20Utah\"&gt;I-15&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2070%20in%20Utah\"&gt;I-70&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2080%20in%20Utah\"&gt;I-80&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2084%20in%20Utah\"&gt;I-84&lt;/a&gt; in Utah have a speed limit of . Other Interstates in Idaho, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming also have the same high speed limits.\nIn some areas, speed limits on Interstates can be significantly lower in areas where they traverse significantly hazardous areas. The maximum speed limit on &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2090%20in%20Ohio\"&gt;I-90&lt;/a&gt; is in downtown &lt;a href=\"Cleveland\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; because of two sharp curves with a suggested limit of in a heavily congested area; &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2070%20in%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;I-70&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Wheeling, West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, has a maximum speed limit of through the &lt;a href=\"Wheeling%20Tunnel\"&gt;Wheeling Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; and most of downtown Wheeling; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2068\"&gt;I-68&lt;/a&gt; has a maximum speed limit of through &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Cumberland, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, because of multiple hazards including sharp curves and narrow lanes through the city. In some locations, low speed limits are the result of lawsuits and resident demands; after holding up the completion of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2035E%20%28Minnesota%29\"&gt;I-35E&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;St. Paul, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, for nearly 30\u00a0years in the courts, residents along the stretch of the freeway from the southern city limit to downtown successfully lobbied for a speed limit in addition to a prohibition on any vehicle weighing more than &lt;a href=\"gross%20vehicle%20weight\"&gt;gross vehicle weight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2093\"&gt;I-93&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Franconia%20Notch%20State%20Park\"&gt;Franconia Notch State Park&lt;/a&gt; in northern New Hampshire has a speed limit of because it is a parkway that consists of only one lane per side of the highway. On the other hand, Interstates 15, 80, 84, and 215 in Utah have speed limits as high as within the &lt;a href=\"Wasatch%20Front\"&gt;Wasatch Front&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cedar%20City%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Cedar City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"St.%20George%2C%20Utah\"&gt;St. George&lt;/a&gt; areas, and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2025%20in%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;I-25&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico within the &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Santa Fe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; areas along with &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2020%20in%20Texas\"&gt;I-20&lt;/a&gt; in Texas along Odessa and &lt;a href=\"Midland%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Midland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2029%20in%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;I-29&lt;/a&gt; in North Dakota along the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Forks%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Grand Forks&lt;/a&gt; area have higher speed limits of .\nOther uses.\nAs one of the components of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Highway System&lt;/a&gt;, Interstate Highways improve the mobility of military troops to and from airports, seaports, rail terminals, and other military bases. Interstate Highways also connect to other roads that are a part of the &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20Highway%20Network\"&gt;Strategic Highway Network&lt;/a&gt;, a system of roads identified as critical to the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Department%20of%20Defense\"&gt;U.S. Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe system has also been used to facilitate evacuations in the face of hurricanes and other natural disasters. An option for maximizing traffic throughput on a highway is to reverse the flow of traffic on one side of a divider so that all lanes become outbound lanes. This procedure, known as &lt;a href=\"contraflow%20lane%20reversal\"&gt;contraflow lane reversal&lt;/a&gt;, has been employed several times for hurricane evacuations. After public outcry regarding the inefficiency of evacuating from southern Louisiana prior to &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Georges\"&gt;Hurricane Georges&lt;/a&gt;' landfall in September 1998, government officials looked towards contraflow to improve evacuation times. In &lt;a href=\"Savannah%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Savannah, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Charleston, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, in 1999, lanes of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2016%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;I-16&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2026%20in%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;I-26&lt;/a&gt; were used in a contraflow configuration in anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Floyd\"&gt;Hurricane Floyd&lt;/a&gt; with mixed results.\nIn 2004 contraflow was employed ahead of &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Charley\"&gt;Hurricane Charley&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tampa%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Tampa, Florida&lt;/a&gt; area and on the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt; before the landfall of &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Ivan\"&gt;Hurricane Ivan&lt;/a&gt;; however, evacuation times there were no better than previous evacuation operations. Engineers began to apply lessons learned from the analysis of prior contraflow operations, including limiting exits, removing troopers (to keep traffic flowing instead of having drivers stop for directions), and improving the dissemination of public information. As a result, the 2005 evacuation of New Orleans, Louisiana, prior to &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Katrina\"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; ran much more smoothly.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"urban%20legend\"&gt;urban legend&lt;/a&gt;, early regulations required that one out of every five miles of the Interstate Highway System must be built straight and flat, so as to be usable by aircraft during times of war. There is no evidence of this rule being included in any Interstate legislation.\nNumbering system.\nPrimary (one- and two-digit) Interstates.\nThe numbering scheme for the Interstate Highway System was developed in 1957 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The association's present numbering policy dates back to August 10, 1973. Within the contiguous United States, primary Interstates\u2014also called main line Interstates or two-digit Interstates\u2014are assigned numbers less than 100.\nWhile numerous exceptions do exist, there is a general scheme for numbering Interstates. Primary Interstates are assigned one- or two-digit numbers, while shorter routes (such as spurs, loops, and short connecting roads) are assigned three-digit numbers where the last two digits match the parent route (thus, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20294\"&gt;I-294&lt;/a&gt; is a loop that connects at both ends to &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2094\"&gt;I-94&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20787\"&gt;I-787&lt;/a&gt; is a short spur route attached to &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2087%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;I-87&lt;/a&gt;). In the numbering scheme for the primary routes, east\u2013west highways are assigned even numbers and north\u2013south highways are assigned odd numbers. Odd route numbers increase from west to east, and even-numbered routes increase from south to north (to avoid confusion with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System\"&gt;U.S. Highways&lt;/a&gt;, which increase from east to west and north to south). This numbering system usually holds true even if the local direction of the route does not match the compass directions. Numbers &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;divisible&lt;/a&gt; by five are intended to be major arteries among the primary routes, carrying traffic long distances. Primary north\u2013south Interstates increase in number from &lt;a href=\"Interstate%205\"&gt;I-5&lt;/a&gt; between Canada and Mexico along the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;West Coast&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2095\"&gt;I\u201195&lt;/a&gt; between Canada and &lt;a href=\"Miami%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Miami, Florida&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;East Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Major west\u2013east arterial Interstates increase in number from &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2010\"&gt;I-10&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Monica%2C%20California\"&gt;Santa Monica, California&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Jacksonville, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2090\"&gt;I-90&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Seattle%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Boston%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, with two exceptions. There are no I-50 and I-60, as routes with those numbers would likely pass through states that currently have &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways\"&gt;U.S. Highways&lt;/a&gt; with the same numbers, which is generally disallowed under highway administration guidelines.\nSeveral two-digit numbers are shared between road segments at opposite ends of the country for various reasons. Some such highways are incomplete Interstates (such as &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2069\"&gt;I-69&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2074\"&gt;I-74&lt;/a&gt;) and some just happen to share route designations (such as &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2076%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;I-76&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2084%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;I-84&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2086%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;I\u201186&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2087%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;I-87&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2088%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;I-88&lt;/a&gt;). Some of these were due to a change in the numbering system as a result of a new policy adopted in 1973. Previously, letter-suffixed numbers were used for long spurs off primary routes; for example, western &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2084%20%28west%29\"&gt;I\u201184&lt;/a&gt; was I\u201180N, as it went north from &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2080\"&gt;I\u201180&lt;/a&gt;. The new policy stated, \"No new divided numbers (such as &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2035W%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;I-35W&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2035E%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;I-35E&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) shall be adopted.\" The new policy also recommended that existing divided numbers be eliminated as quickly as possible; however, an &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2035W%20%28Texas%29\"&gt;I-35W&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2035E%20%28Texas%29\"&gt;I-35E&lt;/a&gt; still exist in the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%E2%80%93Fort%20Worth%20metroplex\"&gt;Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, and an &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2035W%20%28Minnesota%29\"&gt;I-35W&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2035E%20%28Minnesota%29\"&gt;I-35E&lt;/a&gt; that run through &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis\"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Saint Paul&lt;/a&gt;, Minnesota, still exist. Additionally, due to Congressional requirements, three sections of I-69 in southern Texas will be divided into &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2069W\"&gt;I-69W&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2069E\"&gt;I-69E&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2069C\"&gt;I-69C&lt;/a&gt; (for Central).\nAASHTO policy allows dual numbering to provide continuity between major control points. This is referred to as a &lt;a href=\"concurrency%20%28road%29\"&gt;concurrency&lt;/a&gt; or overlap. For example, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2075%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;I\u201175&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2085%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;I\u201185&lt;/a&gt; share the same roadway in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;; this section, called the &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Connector\"&gt;Downtown Connector&lt;/a&gt;, is labeled both I\u201175 and I\u201185. Concurrencies between Interstate and U.S. Route numbers are also allowed in accordance with AASHTO policy, as long as the length of the concurrency is reasonable. In rare instances, two highway designations sharing the same roadway are signed as traveling in opposite directions; one such &lt;a href=\"wrong-way%20concurrency\"&gt;wrong-way concurrency&lt;/a&gt; is found between &lt;a href=\"Wytheville%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Wytheville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Chiswell%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Fort Chiswell&lt;/a&gt;, Virginia, where &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2081%20in%20Virginia\"&gt;I\u201181&lt;/a&gt; north and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2077%20in%20Virginia\"&gt;I\u201177&lt;/a&gt; south are equivalent (with that section of road traveling almost due east), as are I\u201181 south and I\u201177 north.\nAuxiliary (three-digit) Interstates.\nAuxiliary Interstate Highways are circumferential, radial, or spur highways that principally serve &lt;a href=\"urban%20area\"&gt;urban area&lt;/a&gt;s. These types of Interstate Highways are given three-digit route numbers, which consist of a single digit prefixed to the two-digit number of its parent Interstate Highway. Spur routes deviate from their parent and do not return; these are given an odd first digit. Circumferential and radial loop routes return to the parent, and are given an even first digit. Unlike primary Interstates, three-digit Interstates are signed as either east\u2013west or north\u2013south, depending on the general orientation of the route, without regard to the route number. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20190%20%28Massachusetts%29\"&gt;I-190&lt;/a&gt; in Massachusetts is labeled north\u2013south, while &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20195%20%28New%20Jersey%29\"&gt;I-195&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey is labeled east\u2013west. Some looped Interstate routes use &lt;a href=\"inner%E2%80%93outer%20directions\"&gt;inner\u2013outer directions&lt;/a&gt; instead of compass directions, when the use of compass directions would create ambiguity. Due to the large number of these routes, auxiliary route numbers may be repeated in different states along the mainline. Some auxiliary highways do not follow these guidelines, however.\nAlaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nThe Interstate Highway System also extends to &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, even though they have no direct land connections to any other states or territories. However, their residents still pay federal fuel and tire taxes.\nThe Interstates in Hawaii, all located on the most populous island of &lt;a href=\"Oahu\"&gt;Oahu&lt;/a&gt;, carry the prefix H. There are three one-digit routes in the state (&lt;a href=\"Interstate%20H-1\"&gt;H-1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20H-2\"&gt;H-2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20H-3\"&gt;H-3&lt;/a&gt;) and one auxiliary route (&lt;a href=\"Interstate%20H-201\"&gt;H-201&lt;/a&gt;). These Interstates connect several &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Air%20Force\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Navy\"&gt;naval&lt;/a&gt; bases together, as well as the important communities spread across Oahu, and especially within the urban core of &lt;a href=\"Honolulu\"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth Alaska and Puerto Rico also have public highways that receive 90\u00a0percent of their funding from the Interstate Highway program. The &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20Highways%20in%20Alaska\"&gt;Interstates of Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20Highways%20in%20Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; are numbered sequentially in order of funding without regard to the rules on odd and even numbers. They also carry the prefixes A and PR, respectively. However, these highways are signed according to their local designations, not their Interstate Highway numbers. Furthermore, these routes were neither planned according to nor constructed to the official &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20Highway%20standards\"&gt;Interstate Highway standards&lt;/a&gt;.\nMile markers and exit numbers.\nOn one- or two-digit Interstates, the mile marker numbering almost always begins at the southern or western state line. If an Interstate originates within a state, the numbering begins from the location where the road begins in the south or west. As with all guidelines for Interstate routes, however, numerous exceptions exist.\nThree-digit Interstates with an even first number that form a complete circumferential (circle) bypass around a city feature mile markers that are numbered in a clockwise direction, beginning just west of an Interstate that bisects the circumferential route near a south polar location. In other words, mile marker\u00a01 on &lt;a href=\"I-465\"&gt;I-465&lt;/a&gt;, a route around Indianapolis, is just west of its junction with &lt;a href=\"I-65\"&gt;I-65&lt;/a&gt; on the south side of Indianapolis (on the south leg of I-465), and mile marker\u00a053 is just east of this same junction. An exception is &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20495%20%28Capital%20Beltway%29\"&gt;I-495&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Washington metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;, with mileposts increasing counterclockwise because part of that road is also part of &lt;a href=\"I-95\"&gt;I-95&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost Interstate Highways use distance-based &lt;a href=\"exit%20numbers%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;exit numbers&lt;/a&gt; so that the exit number is the same as the nearest mile marker. If multiple exits occur within the same mile, letter suffixes may be appended to the numbers in alphabetical order starting with A. A small number of Interstate Highways (mostly in the Northeastern United States) use sequential-based exit numbering schemes (where each exit is numbered in order starting with 1, without regard for the mile markers on the road). One Interstate Highway, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2019\"&gt;I-19&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona, is signed with kilometer-based exit numbers. In the state of New York, most Interstate Highways use sequential exit numbering, with some exceptions.\nBusiness routes.\nAASHTO defines a category of special routes separate from primary and auxiliary Interstate designations. These routes do not have to comply to Interstate construction or limited-access standards but are routes that may be identified and approved by the association. The same route marking policy applies to both US Numbered Highways and Interstate Highways; however, &lt;a href=\"business%20route\"&gt;business route&lt;/a&gt; designations are sometimes used for Interstate Highways. Known as &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20business%20routes%20of%20the%20Interstate%20Highway%20System\"&gt;Business Loops &amp; Business Spurs&lt;/a&gt;, these routes principally travel through the corporate limits of a city, passing through the central business district when the regular route is directed around the city. They also use a green shield instead of the red and blue shield.\nFinancing.\nInterstate Highways and their rights-of-way are owned by the state in which they were built. The last federally owned portion of the Interstate System was the &lt;a href=\"Woodrow%20Wilson%20Bridge\"&gt;Woodrow Wilson Bridge&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20495%20%28Capital%20Beltway%29\"&gt;Washington Capital Beltway&lt;/a&gt;. The new bridge was completed in 2009 and is collectively owned by Virginia and Maryland. Maintenance is generally the responsibility of the state department of transportation. However, there are some segments of Interstate owned and maintained by local authorities.\nAbout 70\u00a0percent of the construction and maintenance costs of Interstate Highways in the United States have been paid through user fees, primarily the &lt;a href=\"fuel%20tax\"&gt;fuel tax&lt;/a&gt;es collected by the federal, state, and local governments. To a much lesser extent they have been paid for by tolls collected on &lt;a href=\"toll%20highway\"&gt;toll highway&lt;/a&gt;s and bridges. The federal gasoline tax was first imposed in 1932 at one cent per gallon; during the Eisenhower administration, the &lt;a href=\"Highway%20Trust%20Fund\"&gt;Highway Trust Fund&lt;/a&gt;, established by the Highway Revenue Act in 1956, prescribed a three-cent-per-gallon fuel tax, soon increased to 4.5\u00a0cents per gallon. Since 1993 the tax has remained at 18.4\u00a0cents per gallon. Other excise taxes related to highway travel also accumulated in the Highway Trust Fund. Initially, that fund was sufficient for the federal portion of building the Interstate system, built in the early years with \"10 cent dollars\", from the perspective of the states, as the federal government paid 90% of the costs while the state paid 10%. The system grew more rapidly than the rate of the taxes on fuel and other aspects of driving (e. g., excise tax on tires).\nThe rest of the costs of these highways are borne by general fund receipts, bond issues, designated property taxes, and other taxes. The federal contribution comes overwhelmingly from motor vehicle and fuel taxes (93.5\u00a0percent in 2007), as does about 60\u00a0percent of the state contribution. However, any local government contributions are overwhelmingly from sources besides user fees. As decades passed in the 20th century and into the 21st century, the portion of the user fees spent on highways themselves covers about 57\u00a0percent of their costs, with about one-sixth of the user fees being sent to other programs, including the &lt;a href=\"mass%20transit%20system\"&gt;mass transit system&lt;/a&gt;s in large cities. Some large sections of Interstate Highways that were planned or constructed before 1956 are still operated as toll roads, for example the &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Turnpike\"&gt;Massachusetts Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; (I-90), the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Thruway\"&gt;New York State Thruway&lt;/a&gt; (I-87 and I-90), and &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Turnpike\"&gt;Kansas Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; (I-35, I-335, I-470, I-70). Others have had their construction bonds paid off and they have become toll-free, such as the &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%20Turnpike\"&gt;Connecticut Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; (I\u201195), the &lt;a href=\"Richmond-Petersburg%20Turnpike\"&gt;Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; in Virginia (also I\u201195), and the &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Turnpike\"&gt;Kentucky Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; (I\u201165).\nAs American suburbs have expanded, the costs incurred in maintaining freeway infrastructure have also grown, leaving little in the way of funds for new Interstate construction. This has led to the proliferation of toll roads (turnpikes) as the new method of building limited-access highways in suburban areas. Some Interstates are privately maintained (for example, the VMS company maintains I\u201135 in Texas) to meet rising costs of maintenance and allow state departments of transportation to focus on serving the fastest-growing regions in their states.\nParts of the Interstate System might have to be tolled in the future to meet maintenance and expansion demands, as has been done with adding toll &lt;a href=\"High-occupancy%20vehicle%20lane\"&gt;HOV&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"High-occupancy%20toll%20lane\"&gt;HOT lanes&lt;/a&gt; in cities such as &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dallas\"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. Although part of the tolling is an effect of the &lt;a href=\"SAFETEA%E2%80%91LU\"&gt;SAFETEA\u2011LU&lt;/a&gt; act, which has put an emphasis on toll roads as a means to reduce congestion, present federal law does not allow for a state to change a freeway section to a tolled section for all traffic.\nTolls.\nAbout of toll roads are included in the Interstate Highway System. While federal legislation initially banned the collection of tolls on Interstates, many of the toll roads on the system were either completed or under construction when the Interstate Highway System was established. Since these highways provided logical connections to other parts of the system, they were designated as Interstate highways. &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; also decided that it was too costly to either build toll-free Interstates parallel to these toll roads, or directly repay all the bondholders who financed these facilities and remove the tolls. Thus, these toll roads were &lt;a href=\"Grandfather%20clause\"&gt;grandfathered&lt;/a&gt; into the Interstate Highway System.\nToll roads designated as Interstates (such as the &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Turnpike\"&gt;Massachusetts Turnpike&lt;/a&gt;) were typically allowed to continue collecting tolls, but are generally ineligible to receive federal funds for maintenance and improvements. Some toll roads that did receive federal funds to finance emergency repairs (notably the &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%20Turnpike\"&gt;Connecticut Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; (I-95) following the &lt;a href=\"Mianus%20River%20Bridge\"&gt;Mianus River Bridge&lt;/a&gt; collapse) were required to remove tolls as soon as the highway's construction bonds were paid off. In addition, these toll facilities were grandfathered from &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20Highway%20standards\"&gt;Interstate Highway standards&lt;/a&gt;. A notable example is the western approach to the &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Franklin%20Bridge\"&gt;Benjamin Franklin Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20676\"&gt;I-676&lt;/a&gt; has a surface street section through a historic area.\nPolicies on toll facilities and Interstate Highways have since changed. The &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Highway%20Administration\"&gt;Federal Highway Administration&lt;/a&gt; has allowed some states to collect tolls on existing Interstate Highways, while a recent extension of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20376\"&gt;I-376&lt;/a&gt; included a section of &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Route%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B60\"&gt;Pennsylvania Route\u00a060&lt;/a&gt; that was tolled by the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Turnpike%20Commission\"&gt;Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission&lt;/a&gt; before receiving Interstate designation. Also, newer toll facilities (like the tolled section of I-376, which was built in the early 1990s) must conform to Interstate standards. A new addition of the \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20on%20Uniform%20Traffic%20Control%20Devices\"&gt;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2009 requires a black-on-yellow \"Toll\" sign to be placed above the Interstate trailblazer on Interstate Highways that collect tolls.\nLegislation passed in 2005 known as &lt;a href=\"SAFETEA-LU\"&gt;SAFETEA-LU&lt;/a&gt;, encouraged states to construct new Interstate Highways through \"innovative financing\" methods. SAFETEA-LU facilitated states to pursue innovative financing by easing the restrictions on building interstates as toll roads, either through state agencies or through &lt;a href=\"public%E2%80%93private%20partnership\"&gt;public\u2013private partnership&lt;/a&gt;s. However, SAFETEA-LU left in place a prohibition of installing tolls on existing toll-free Interstates, and states wishing to toll such routes to finance upgrades and repairs must first seek approval from Congress. Many states have started using &lt;a href=\"High-occupancy%20toll%20lane\"&gt;High-occupancy toll lane&lt;/a&gt; and other partial tolling methods, whereby certain lanes of highly congested freeways are tolled, while others are left free, allowing people to pay a fee to travel in less congested lanes. Examples of recent projects to add HOT lanes to existing freeways include the &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20HOT%20lanes\"&gt;Virginia HOT lanes&lt;/a&gt; on the Virginia portions of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20Beltway\"&gt;Capital Beltway&lt;/a&gt; and other related interstate highways (I-95, I-495, I-395) and the addition of express toll lanes to &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2077%20in%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Interstate 77 in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Charlotte metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;.\nChargeable and non-chargeable Interstate routes.\nInterstate Highways financed with federal funds are known as \"chargeable\" Interstate routes, and are considered part of the network of highways. Federal laws also allow \"non-chargeable\" Interstate routes, highways funded similarly to state and U.S. Highways to be signed as Interstates, if they both meet the Interstate Highway standards and are logical additions or connections to the system. These additions fall under two categories: routes that already meet Interstate standards, and routes not yet upgraded to Interstate standards. Only routes that meet Interstate standards may be signed as Interstates once their proposed number is approved.\nSignage.\nInterstate shield.\nInterstate Highways are signed by a number placed on a red, white, and blue &lt;a href=\"Highway%20shield\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;. The shield design itself is a &lt;a href=\"registered%20trademark\"&gt;registered trademark&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20and%20Transportation%20Officials\"&gt;American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials&lt;/a&gt;. The colors red, white, and blue were chosen because they are the colors of the &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American flag&lt;/a&gt;. In the original design, the name of the state was displayed above the highway number, but in many states, this area is now left blank, allowing for the printing of larger and more-legible digits. Signs with the shield alone are placed periodically throughout each Interstate as &lt;a href=\"reassurance%20marker\"&gt;reassurance marker&lt;/a&gt;s. These signs usually measure high, and are wide for two-digit Interstates or for three-digit Interstates.\nInterstate business loops and spurs use a special shield in which the red and blue are replaced with green, the word \"BUSINESS\" appears instead of \"INTERSTATE\", and the word \"SPUR\" or \"LOOP\" usually appears above the number. The green shield is employed to mark the main route through a city's central business district, which intersects the associated Interstate at one (spur) or both (loop) ends of the business route. The route usually traverses the main thoroughfare(s) of the city's downtown area or other major business district. A city may have more than one Interstate-derived business route, depending on the number of Interstates passing through a city and the number of significant business districts therein.\nOver time, the design of the Interstate shield has changed. In 1957 the Interstate shield designed by &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Highway%20Department\"&gt;Texas Highway Department&lt;/a&gt; employee Richard Oliver was introduced, the winner of a contest that included 100\u00a0entries; at the time, the shield color was a dark navy blue and only wide. The \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20on%20Uniform%20Traffic%20Control%20Devices\"&gt;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&lt;/a&gt;\" (MUTCD) standards revised the shield in the 1961, 1971, and 1978 editions.\nExit numbering.\nThe majority of Interstates have &lt;a href=\"exit%20number\"&gt;exit number&lt;/a&gt;s. Like other highways, Interstates feature &lt;a href=\"Road%20signs%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Guide\"&gt;guide signs&lt;/a&gt; that list &lt;a href=\"control%20cities\"&gt;control cities&lt;/a&gt; to help direct drivers through interchanges and exits toward their desired destination. All &lt;a href=\"Road%20signs%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;traffic sign&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"lane\"&gt;lane&lt;/a&gt; markings on the Interstates are supposed to be designed in compliance with the &lt;a href=\"Manual%20on%20Uniform%20Traffic%20Control%20Devices\"&gt;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&lt;/a&gt; (MUTCD). There are, however, many local and regional variations in signage.\nFor many years, California was the only state that did not use an exit numbering system. It was granted an exemption in the 1950s due to having an already largely completed and signed highway system; placing exit number signage across the state was deemed too expensive. To control costs, California began to incorporate exit numbers on its freeways in 2002\u2014Interstate, U.S., and state routes alike. &lt;a href=\"California%20Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;Caltrans&lt;/a&gt; commonly installs exit number signage only when a freeway or interchange is built, reconstructed, retrofitted, or repaired, and it is usually tacked onto the top-right corner of an already existing sign. Newer signs along the freeways follow this practice as well. Most exits along California's Interstates now have exit number signage, particularly in rural areas. California, however, still does not use mileposts, although a few exist for experiments or for special purposes. In 2010\u20132011, the &lt;a href=\"Illinois%20State%20Toll%20Highway%20Authority\"&gt;Illinois State Toll Highway Authority&lt;/a&gt; posted all new mile markers to be uniform with the rest of the state on I\u201190 (Jane Addams Memorial/Northwest Tollway) and the I\u201194 section of the Tri\u2011State Tollway, which previously had matched the I\u2011294 section starting in the south at I\u201180/I\u201194/IL Route 394. This also applied to the tolled portion of the Ronald Reagan Tollway (I-88). The tollway also added exit number tabs to the exits.\nExit numbers correspond to Interstate mileage markers in most states. On &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2019\"&gt;I\u201119&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arizona\"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, however, length is measured in kilometers instead of miles because, at the time of construction, a push for the United States to change to a &lt;a href=\"metric%20system\"&gt;metric system&lt;/a&gt; of measurement had gained enough traction that it was mistakenly assumed that all highway measurements would eventually be changed to metric; proximity to metric-using &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; may also have been a factor, as I\u201119 indirectly connects I\u201110 to the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Federal%20Highway\"&gt;Mexican Federal Highway&lt;/a&gt; system via surface streets in &lt;a href=\"Nogales%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Nogales&lt;/a&gt;. Mileage count increases from west to east on most even-numbered Interstates; on odd-numbered Interstates mileage count increases from south to north.\nSome highways, including the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Thruway\"&gt;New York State Thruway&lt;/a&gt;, use sequential exit-numbering schemes. Exits on the New York State Thruway count up from &lt;a href=\"Yonkers%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Yonkers&lt;/a&gt; traveling north, and then west from Albany. I\u201187 in New York State is numbered in three sections. The first section makes up the &lt;a href=\"Major%20Deegan%20Expressway\"&gt;Major Deegan Expressway&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bronx\"&gt;Bronx&lt;/a&gt;, with interchanges numbered sequentially from 1 to 14. The second section of I\u201187 is a part of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Thruway\"&gt;New York State Thruway&lt;/a&gt; that starts in Yonkers (exit\u00a01) and continues north to Albany (exit\u00a024); at Albany, the Thruway turns west and becomes I\u201190 for exits\u00a025 to 61. From Albany north to the Canadian border, the exits on I\u201187 are numbered sequentially from 1 to 44 along the &lt;a href=\"Adirondack%20Northway\"&gt;Adirondack Northway&lt;/a&gt;. This often leads to confusion as there is more than one exit on I\u201187 with the same number. For example, exit\u00a04 on Thruway section of I\u201187 connects with the Cross County Parkway in Yonkers, but exit\u00a04 on the Northway is the exit for the Albany airport. These two exits share a number but are located apart.\nMany northeastern states label exit numbers sequentially, regardless of how many miles have passed between exits. States in which Interstate exits are still numbered sequentially are Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont; as such, three of the main Interstate Highways that remain completely within these states (&lt;a href=\"Interstate%2087%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;87&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2088%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;88&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2089\"&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;) have interchanges numbered sequentially along their entire routes. Maine, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, and Florida followed this system for a number of years, but have since converted to mileage-based exit numbers. Georgia renumbered in 2000, while Maine did so in 2004. The &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Turnpike\"&gt;Pennsylvania Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; uses both mile marker numbers and sequential numbers. Mile marker numbers are used for signage, while sequential numbers are used for numbering interchanges internally. The &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey%20Turnpike\"&gt;New Jersey Turnpike&lt;/a&gt;, including the portions that are signed as I\u201195 and I\u201178, also has sequential numbering, but other Interstates within New Jersey use mile markers.\nSign locations.\nThere are four common signage methods on Interstates:\nImpact and reception.\nFollowing the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, the railroad system for passengers and freight declined sharply, but the trucking industry expanded dramatically and the cost of shipping and travel fell sharply. &lt;a href=\"Suburbanization\"&gt;Suburbanization&lt;/a&gt; became possible, with the rapid growth of larger, sprawling, and more car dependent housing than was available in central cities. Tourism dramatically expanded as well, creating a demand for more service stations, motels, restaurants and visitor attractions. There was much more long-distance movement to the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Belt\"&gt;Sun Belt&lt;/a&gt; for winter vacations, or for permanent relocation, with convenient access to visits to relatives back home. In rural areas, towns and small cities off the grid lost out as shoppers followed the interstate and new factories were located near them.\nThe system had a particularly strong effect in Southern states, where major highways were inadequate. The new system facilitated the relocation of heavy manufacturing to the South and spurred the development of Southern-based corporations like &lt;a href=\"Walmart\"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (in Arkansas) and &lt;a href=\"FedEx\"&gt;FedEx&lt;/a&gt; (in Tennessee).\nThe Interstate Highway System has been criticized for contributing to the decline of some cities that were too far from it and for displacing minority neighborhoods in urban centers. Highways have also been criticized for increasing racial segregation by creating physical barriers between neighborhoods. Other critics have blamed the Interstate Highway System for the decline of &lt;a href=\"public%20transportation%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;public transportation in the United States&lt;/a&gt; since the 1950s."
