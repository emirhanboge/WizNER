    "text": "Alan Graham Judge (born 14 May 1960) is a retired professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;er, who is the seventh oldest player to play in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt;. He played as a goalkeeper.\nDuring his career he played for various clubs at all tiers of the League. He was part of the &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Oxford United&lt;/a&gt; team that won the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Milk Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1986. He also briefly served as a backup goalkeeper for &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup Winners' Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nOften referred to as The Judge, after retiring from the professional game he worked as a driving instructor and goalkeeping coach at several clubs including Swindon and Oxford, occasionally acting as emergency goalkeeping cover. In 2001, he organised a re-run of the 1986 Milk Cup Final against &lt;a href=\"Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;QPR&lt;/a&gt;, for charity.\nOn 18 March 2003, at the age of 42, he played his first Football League match since leaving &lt;a href=\"Hereford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Hereford United&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. He helped Oxford to a 1\u20131 draw with &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Cambridge United&lt;/a&gt;, making a vital save in stoppage time. During the 2003\u201304 season he also made several appearances for &lt;a href=\"Didcot%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Didcot Town&lt;/a&gt;. He made a second appearance for Oxford on 6 November 2004, at the age of 44 years and 176 days. This made him the seventh oldest footballer ever to have appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;."
