    "text": "This list of earthquakes in Chile includes every known major earthquake that was felt or with its epicenter within Chile's current boundaries.\nStatistics and Map.\nStatistics for earthquakes with M \u2265 7.0 in Chile are detailed on the list below.\nThe region, which is adjacent to the fast-moving &lt;a href=\"Nazca%20Plate\"&gt;Nazca Plate&lt;/a&gt;, has high tectonic activity. To keep the list manageable, only earthquakes with magnitude \u2265 7.0 will be included, or if it has other notable features like the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Pichilemu%20earthquake\"&gt;2010 Pichilemu earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. The records for earlier centuries are apparently incomplete.\nOf the &lt;a href=\"Lists%20of%20earthquakes%23Largest%20earthquakes%20by%20magnitude\"&gt;world's 36 known earthquakes with M \u2265 8.5&lt;/a&gt; since the year 1500, one-third occurred in Chile and are shown in the map to the side. Some virtually have the same epicenters like the 1604 and &lt;a href=\"1868%20Arica%20earthquake\"&gt;1868&lt;/a&gt; (in Arica), the &lt;a href=\"1730%20Valpara%C3%ADso%20earthquake\"&gt;1730&lt;/a&gt; and 1822 (in Valpara\u00edso), the &lt;a href=\"1751%20Concepci%C3%B3n%20earthquake\"&gt;1751&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1835%20Concepci%C3%B3n%20earthquake\"&gt;1835&lt;/a&gt; (in Concepci\u00f3n), and the &lt;a href=\"1575%20Valdivia%20earthquake\"&gt;1575&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1837%20Valdivia%20earthquake\"&gt;1837&lt;/a&gt; (in Valdivia).\nThe strongest known recorded in modern times was also in Chile, the &lt;a href=\"1960%20Valdivia%20earthquake\"&gt;1960 Valdivia earthquake&lt;/a&gt;."
