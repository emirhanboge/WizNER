    "text": "Dzhemal Noyevich Kherhadze (; 2 February 1945 \u2013 11 March 2019) was a &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and coach.\nHe was most notable as the co-top scorer of the &lt;a href=\"1969%20Soviet%20Top%20League\"&gt;1969 Soviet Top League&lt;/a&gt; with 16 goals. He was not awarded the top scorer prize as the &lt;a href=\"Trud%20%28Russian%20newspaper%29\"&gt;Trud&lt;/a&gt; newspaper which was awarding said prize suspected that the last game of the season, in which he scored a hat-trick to catch up to &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Osyanin\"&gt;Nikolai Osyanin&lt;/a&gt; on the scorers list, was fixed (his team &lt;a href=\"FC%20Torpedo%20Kutaisi\"&gt;FC Torpedo Kutaisi&lt;/a&gt; played &lt;a href=\"FC%20SKA%20Rostov-on-Don\"&gt;FC SKA Rostov-on-Don&lt;/a&gt; with a score of 3-3, SKA's &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Proskurin\"&gt;Vladimir Proskurin&lt;/a&gt;, who also scored a hat-trick to catch up with Osyanin, was not awarded the prize either). Formally the decision was justified by Osyanin scoring in \"more important\" games."
