The team play their home games at Stoneyhill and currently compete in the , the top tier of Scottish club rugby.\nMusselburgh RFC first applied to join the Edinburgh &amp; District League in 1921 but it is believed that the town had a team for at least 20 years before that.\nHistory.\nThe club was formed in 1921 as a section of the Musselburgh Sports Club. They initially played their games at Shirehaugh which is now a practice green at The Musselburgh Golf Club in Monktonhall. During the 1930s the club broke away from the Sports Club to form its own identity.\nDuring 1951, the club moved from its home at Shirehaugh to a new pitch at Stoneyhill where the club currently resides. A clubhouse was built on the site and opened in 1971, with changing rooms added in 1984 and a gym added in 2021.\nAfter the creation of the new leagues in Scotland the club were placed in the third division, ultimately falling to fifth division in 1975. However they bounced back and continued to climb up the leagues where they were promoted to the Premiership for the first time in 1987, lasting one season before being relegated.\nThe club continued to stay around the second and third tiers before a sharp fall to the regional leagues in the late 2000s. The team slowly climbed their way back up to the National leagues before winning National 2 in 2015. With the formation of the Super6 in 2018, the top six teams from National 1 had the chance to be promoted to the Premiership to join the remaining four teams. Musselburgh claimed a bonus point on the final day of the season to win the final spot.\nMusselburgh Sevens.\nThe club runs the Musselburgh Sevens tournament.\nNotable former players.\nEdinburgh District.\nThe following former Musselburgh players have represented &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20District%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Edinburgh District&lt;/a&gt; at provincial level."
