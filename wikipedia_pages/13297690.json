    "text": "Honours and awards to Harold Pinter lists (in chronological order) &lt;a href=\"honour\"&gt;honour&lt;/a&gt;s, awards, prizes, and honorary degrees received by English playwright &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Pinter\"&gt;Harold Pinter&lt;/a&gt; (1930\u20132008), which often acknowledge his international importance and his reach beyond national and regional boundaries.\nBackground.\nPinter declined a British &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;hood in 1996, when it was offered to him on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; by British Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"John%20Major\"&gt;John Major&lt;/a&gt;, then leader of the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his declining it, many in the &lt;a href=\"public%20media\"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; (both in the UK and elsewhere) still refer erroneously to Pinter as \"Sir Harold Pinter\".\nIn addition to having already been made a &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire\"&gt;Commander of the Order of the British Empire&lt;/a&gt; (CBE) in 1966, he accepted the award of &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Companions%20of%20Honour\"&gt;Companion of Honour&lt;/a&gt; (CH) for services to Literature from the British monarch in 2002. He was presented the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature\"&gt;Nobel Prize in Literature&lt;/a&gt; in December 2005 and the French &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur\"&gt;L\u00e9gion d'honneur&lt;/a&gt; in January 2007.\nHe was awarded academic &lt;a href=\"honorary%20degree\"&gt;honorary degree&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Leeds\"&gt;University of Leeds&lt;/a&gt;, in April 2007 (in person), at which its Humanities faculty processed in full academic garb solely to present the honorary doctorate to Pinter; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Kragujevac\"&gt;University of Kragujevac&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;; and at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, in June 2008 (both of the latter in absentia). In December 2007, the &lt;a href=\"British%20Library\"&gt;British Library&lt;/a&gt; announced that it had acquired his literary archive for over &lt;a href=\"British%20pound%20sterling\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;1.1 million (approx. US$2.24 million) on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British nation&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter having accepted the honorary presidency of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20School%20of%20Speech%20and%20Drama\"&gt;Central School of Speech and Drama&lt;/a&gt;, a constituent college of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20London\"&gt;University of London&lt;/a&gt;, in October 2008, he received an honorary fellowship during its honorary degree ceremony, also in absentia, due to ill health, on 10 December 2008, two weeks before his death from cancer on 24 December 2008."
