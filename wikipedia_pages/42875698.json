    "text": "Lane City or Mineral City was a &lt;a href=\"Human%20settlement\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"White%20Pine%20County%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;White Pine County, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. It is now a &lt;a href=\"ghost%20town\"&gt;ghost town&lt;/a&gt;.\nA mining camp was founded in 1869 just west of &lt;a href=\"Ely%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Ely, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, and named Mineral City until 1876. Since Mineral City lay on the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Overland%20Route\"&gt;Central Overland Route&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; stop followed, and by 1872, the &lt;a href=\"boomtown\"&gt;boomtown&lt;/a&gt; had a &lt;a href=\"post%20office\"&gt;post office&lt;/a&gt; and more than 600 inhabitants. In 1896 the town was renamed Lane City for Charles D. Lane, following his purchase of Chainman, a major local mining and milling operation. Lane City continued into the twentieth century, but as of 2014 the town (lying along what is now &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2050%20in%20Nevada\"&gt;US 50&lt;/a&gt;) is abandoned and only a few structures and foundations remain."
