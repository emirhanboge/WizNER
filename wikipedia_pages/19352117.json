    "text": "Asclepiades of &lt;a href=\"Phlius\"&gt;Phlius&lt;/a&gt; (; c. 350 \u2013 c. 270 BC) was a &lt;a href=\"Greek%20philosophy\"&gt;Greek philosopher&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eretrian%20school\"&gt;Eretrian school&lt;/a&gt; of philosophy. He was the friend of &lt;a href=\"Menedemus%20of%20Eretria\"&gt;Menedemus of Eretria&lt;/a&gt;, and they both went to live in &lt;a href=\"Megara\"&gt;Megara&lt;/a&gt; and studied under &lt;a href=\"Stilpo\"&gt;Stilpo&lt;/a&gt;, before sailing to &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Elis\"&gt;Elis&lt;/a&gt; to join &lt;a href=\"Phaedo%20of%20Elis\"&gt;Phaedo&lt;/a&gt;'s school. His friendship with Menedemus was said to have been hardly inferior to the friendship of &lt;a href=\"Pylades\"&gt;Pylades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orestes%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Orestes&lt;/a&gt;. As impoverished young men living in &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, they were one day summoned before the &lt;a href=\"Areopagus\"&gt;Areopagus&lt;/a&gt;, to explain how they could spend all day with the philosophers if they had no visible means of support. They summoned a &lt;a href=\"miller\"&gt;miller&lt;/a&gt; to the court to explain that they &lt;a href=\"Threshing\"&gt;threshed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cereal\"&gt;grain&lt;/a&gt; at night for 2 &lt;a href=\"drachma\"&gt;drachma&lt;/a&gt;s, whereupon the Areopagites were so astonished that they awarded the two men 200 drachmas as a reward.\nThey eventually settled in &lt;a href=\"Eretria\"&gt;Eretria&lt;/a&gt;, having transferred Phaedo's school there. It was said that they were both married and that Asclepiades was married to the mother, and Menedemus to the daughter. And when Asclepiades's wife died, he took the wife of Menedemus, and Menedemus went on to marry a rich woman. They all lived in one house, and Menedemus entrusted the whole management of it to his former wife. Asclepiades died before Menedemus, at Eretria, at a great age."
