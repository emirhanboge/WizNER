    "text": "Kung is the name of two &lt;a href=\"fictional%20character\"&gt;fictional character&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"DC%20Comics\"&gt;DC Comics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"DC%20Universe\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first version of the character was an &lt;a href=\"Earth-Two\"&gt;Earth-Two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"supervillain\"&gt;supervillain&lt;/a&gt; who fought the &lt;a href=\"Wonder%20Woman\"&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"All-Star%20Squadron\"&gt;All-Star Squadron&lt;/a&gt; of that world in stories taking place before the \"&lt;a href=\"Crisis%20on%20Infinite%20Earths\"&gt;Crisis on Infinite Earths&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFictional character biography.\nThomas Morita.\nThe early life of Thomas Morita was fraught with difficulty. His parents immigrated to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;. During the Depression, his father was unable to find work and eventually died. His mother died soon afterward, leaving only Thomas and his sister, Nancy. Morita traveled to his parents' homeland to train as a &lt;a href=\"samurai\"&gt;samurai&lt;/a&gt; and learning of the &lt;a href=\"Japanese-American%20internment\"&gt;Japanese-American internment&lt;/a&gt; only further fueled his hatred of America. At some point during his training, he underwent some unexplained mystical process that imbued him with the power to transform into &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nKung undertook his first assignment on December 30, 1941, to kill &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Churchill\"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt; on his way to &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; but is stopped by the hero &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Steel\"&gt;Steel&lt;/a&gt;. (\"All-Star Squadron\" #8 [April 1982])\nOn March 4, 1942, Kung is hired by the mysterious Prince Daka to team up with &lt;a href=\"Tsunami%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Tsunami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samurai%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Samurai&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sumo%20%28DC%20Comics%29\"&gt;Sumo&lt;/a&gt;, to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"All-Star%20Squadron\"&gt;All-Star Squadron's&lt;/a&gt; headquarters and steal &lt;a href=\"Starman%20%28DC%20Comics%20Golden%20Age%29\"&gt;Starman's&lt;/a&gt; gravity rod. This theft is thwarted by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20%28DC%20Comics%29\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and Kung escapes with Prince Daka. (\"All-Star Squadron\" #42-43 [February\u2013March 1985])\nIn 1943, Kung is assigned to kill &lt;a href=\"General\"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20MacArthur\"&gt;Douglas MacArthur&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; Wonder Woman foils the assassination attempt, but Kung escapes to his sister's home in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Chinatown\"&gt;Chinatown&lt;/a&gt;. Kung tries again to assassinate MacArthur at the &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard\"&gt;Brooklyn Navy Yard&lt;/a&gt;, but is himself apparently killed while saving his sister from the weight of a teetering &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt; whose &lt;a href=\"drydock\"&gt;drydock&lt;/a&gt; supports had been washed away. (\"Wonder Woman\" #237-238 [November\u2013December 1977])\nSometime prior to his death, Kung is brought aboard the &lt;a href=\"Monitor%20%28comics%29\"&gt;Monitor&lt;/a&gt;'s satellite by &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28DC%20Comics%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt; as part of a combined effort to save the remaining &lt;a href=\"Multiverse%20%28DC%20Comics%29\"&gt;Earths&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Monitor\"&gt;Anti-Monitor&lt;/a&gt;. (\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #5 [August 1985]) He is later recruited by &lt;a href=\"Brainiac%20%28character%29\"&gt;Brainiac&lt;/a&gt; as part of his massive &lt;a href=\"supervillain\"&gt;supervillain&lt;/a&gt; army to conquer those remaining Earths. (\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #9 [December 1985]).\nAfter the effects of \"&lt;a href=\"Crisis%20on%20Infinite%20Earths\"&gt;Crisis on Infinite Earths&lt;/a&gt;\", Kung's history was incorporated into the combined Earth that was formed, with some details having changed. Chief among those changes were that the &lt;a href=\"Wonder%20Woman\"&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/a&gt; that Kung fought during World War II was now a time-tossed &lt;a href=\"Hippolyta%20%28DC%20Comics%29\"&gt;Hippolyta&lt;/a&gt; and not Diana. \nIt is assumed that he survived his supposed death while saving his sister, because his true death was revealed in \"Justice Society of America\" #27 and 28 (July and August 2009). It was revealed that he had made a deal with the U.S. Army in 1945 to convince &lt;a href=\"Hirohito\"&gt;Hirohito&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor of Japan, to surrender. However, the deadline for the surrender ran out and Hiroshima was bombed. Kung was onsite and died in the explosion. His spirit returned to plague the modern day &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Society%20of%20America\"&gt;Justice Society of America&lt;/a&gt; in these issues.\nA chronologically younger Kung is seen in DC's \"&lt;a href=\"Guns%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Guns of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\" miniseries, taking place in 1927.\nKung II.\nA second unidentified Kung (be it a descendant or an unrelated person) debuted in \"Wonder Woman\" (vol. 3) Annual #1 (2007) as a previously unrevealed foe of &lt;a href=\"Wonder%20Woman\"&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/a&gt;.\nPowers and abilities.\nKung had the ability to transform himself into animal forms through concentration. Among the animals he transformed into were a man-sized &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"rhinoceros\"&gt;rhinoceros&lt;/a&gt;. Kung was able to retain his human intelligence when transformed but reverted to his human form if he somehow lost his concentration. As a samurai, he was also a master of several Japanese &lt;a href=\"martial%20arts\"&gt;martial arts&lt;/a&gt;."
