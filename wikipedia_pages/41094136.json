    "text": "The 2013 CECAFA Cup Final was a &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; match that took place on Thursday, 12 December 2013 at the &lt;a href=\"Nyayo%20National%20Stadium\"&gt;Nyayo National Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nairobi\"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt; to coincide with &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;'s 50th &lt;a href=\"Jamhuri%20Day\"&gt;Jamhuri Day&lt;/a&gt; celebrations. It was contested by the hosts &lt;a href=\"Kenya%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sudan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; to determine the winner of the &lt;a href=\"2013%20CECAFA%20Cup\"&gt;2013 CECAFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nPrior to the match, the two nations had 8 titles between them, with Kenya claiming 5 titles, 8 less than the record 13 titles held by &lt;a href=\"Uganda%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;, who were knocked out by &lt;a href=\"Tanzania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20CECAFA%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Quarter-finals\"&gt;quarter-finals&lt;/a&gt;. This was Sudan's first participation in a CECAFA Cup final since &lt;a href=\"2007%20CECAFA%20Cup\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, when they beat &lt;a href=\"Rwanda%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 to clinch their 3rd title. This was also the first time the two nations faced each other in a final, and was Kenya's first win in &lt;a href=\"2002%20CECAFA%20Cup\"&gt;11 years&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoad to the final.\nKenya.\nKenya, who were hosting the tournament as part of its celebrations of 50 years of independence, were drawn into &lt;a href=\"2013%20CECAFA%20Cup%20group%20stage%23Group%20A\"&gt;Group A&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Sudan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, whom they were with in the &lt;a href=\"2012%20CECAFA%20Cup%20group%20stage%23Group%20A\"&gt;same group the previous year&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Zanzibar%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Zanzibar&lt;/a&gt;. They began their campaign against Ethiopia on 27 November, with whom they drew 0\u20130 despite both teams having several chances to win the game. The next match against &lt;a href=\"South%20Sudan%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt; proved to be a relatively easier affair for the Harambee Stars, who won the game 3\u20131 at the &lt;a href=\"Nyayo%20National%20Stadium\"&gt;Nyayo National Stadium&lt;/a&gt; thanks to goals from &lt;a href=\"Jockins%20Atudo\"&gt;Jockins Atudo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2013%20Kenyan%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2013 Kenyan Premier League&lt;/a&gt; top scorer &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20Keli\"&gt;Jacob Keli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"David%20Owino\"&gt;David Owino&lt;/a&gt;, despite Atudo's goal being cancelled out by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Justin%20Lado\"&gt;Richard Justin&lt;/a&gt; in the 26th minute. Kenya beat &lt;a href=\"Zanzibar%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Zanzibar&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20130 in their last group stage match at the &lt;a href=\"Afraha%20Stadium\"&gt;Afraha Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nakuru\"&gt;Nakuru&lt;/a&gt;, through &lt;a href=\"Jockins%20Atudo\"&gt;Jockins Atudo&lt;/a&gt;'s second goal from the penalty spot and a stunning strike from the edge of the penalty box by &lt;a href=\"A.F.C.%20Leopards\"&gt;A.F.C. Leopards&lt;/a&gt; striker &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Wanga\"&gt;Allan Wanga&lt;/a&gt;. Since Ethiopia finished their group stage campaign with the same number of points, goal difference and goals as Kenya, a coin toss was decided on to determine the winner of Group A. Kenya won the toss and booked themselves a match against &lt;a href=\"Rwanda%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20CECAFA%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Quarter-finals\"&gt;quarter-finals&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the quarter-finals, Rwanda proved to be very tough opposition for Kenya, who narrowly managed to grab a win through a penalty kick from &lt;a href=\"Jockins%20Atudo\"&gt;Jockins Atudo&lt;/a&gt;, after the ball was handled in the box by &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Rusheshangoga\"&gt;Michel Rusheshangoga&lt;/a&gt;. The goal was Atudo's third goal of the tournament, his third from the penalty spot, making him Kenya's top scorer of the tournament and sending Kenya through to the &lt;a href=\"2013%20CECAFA%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Semi-finals\"&gt;semi-finals&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn their &lt;a href=\"2013%20CECAFA%20Cup%20group%20stage%23Semi-final%201\"&gt;semi-final clash&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Tanzania%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;, Kenya won the game in the 3rd minute, after &lt;a href=\"Thika%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Thika United&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Clifton%20Miheso\"&gt;Clifton Miheso&lt;/a&gt; pounced on a ball that was punched into his path by &lt;a href=\"Gor%20Mahia%20F.C.\"&gt;Gor Mahia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ivo%20Mapunda\"&gt;Ivo Mapunda&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Taifa Stars could've rescued their efforts in the 89th minute, but &lt;a href=\"TP%20Mazembe\"&gt;TP Mazembe&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mbwana%20Samatta\"&gt;Mbwana Samatta&lt;/a&gt; had his shot go just above the crossbar, much to the relief of the Kenyan fans.\nSudan.\nSudan were drawn into Group C alongside &lt;a href=\"Eritrea%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rwanda%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; and defending champions &lt;a href=\"Uganda%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;, who have won the tournament a record 13 times. Eritrea were Sudan's first assignment of their campaign, and easily saw them off with a 3\u20130 rout through first-half goals from &lt;a href=\"Salah%20Ibrahim\"&gt;Salah Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt;, who scored a brace, and &lt;a href=\"Muhannad%20El%20Tahir\"&gt;Muhannad El Tahir&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Megweya%20Omer\"&gt;Megweya Omer&lt;/a&gt; pulled one back for Eritrea in the 73rd minute, but his goal was ruled offside. Sudan sealed their place in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20CECAFA%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Quarter-finals\"&gt;quarter-finals&lt;/a&gt; in their second match of the group stage, where they beat &lt;a href=\"Rwanda%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; with a solitary goal in the 29th minute from Salah Ibrahim, which made him the tournament's top scorer. However, the Falcons of Jediane fell in their last match of the group stage, after being beaten 1\u20130 by &lt;a href=\"Uganda%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; thanks to a goal from &lt;a href=\"Tusker%20F.C.\"&gt;Tusker&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Khalid%20Aucho\"&gt;Khalid Aucho&lt;/a&gt; in the 58th minute.\nHaving finished in second place in Group C, Sudan booked a &lt;a href=\"2013%20CECAFA%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Quarter-final%204\"&gt;quarter-final match&lt;/a&gt; against Group A runners-up &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Saladin%20Bargecho\"&gt;Saladin Bargecho&lt;/a&gt; made the task at hand easier for Sudan, when he put the ball into his own net from a corner in the 22nd minute. &lt;a href=\"Salah%20Ibrahim\"&gt;Salah Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt;'s fourth strike of the tournament in the 69th minute sealed the win for Sudan and a place in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20CECAFA%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Semi-finals\"&gt;semi-finals&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"2012%20Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;2012 Africa Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt; champions &lt;a href=\"Zambia%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSudan's &lt;a href=\"2013%20CECAFA%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Semi-final%202\"&gt;semi-final&lt;/a&gt; proved to be a very tough task, and 30 minutes of &lt;a href=\"Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Association%20football\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt; were needed to determine the winner of the match. &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Kampamba\"&gt;Ronald Kampamba&lt;/a&gt; gave Chipolopolo the lead in the 113th minute and the match seemed to have been tipped in Zambia's favour, but incredibly &lt;a href=\"Miaaz%20Abdelrahim\"&gt;Miaaz Abdelrahim&lt;/a&gt; salvaged the game for Sudan with an equaliser just 2 minutes to the end of the match. Just when it seemed that a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty shoot-out&lt;/a&gt; was in the offing, &lt;a href=\"Salah%20Ibrahim\"&gt;Salah Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt; stepped up for the fifth time to send Sudan to the final in dramatic fashion, after slotting the ball past goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Toaster%20Nsabata\"&gt;Toaster Nsabata&lt;/a&gt; into the net just seconds to the final whistle.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nKenya were in control of possession for most of the match, and in the 35th minute skipper &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Wanga\"&gt;Allan Wanga&lt;/a&gt; gave the hosts the lead with a thundering header past goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Abdel%20Rahman%20Ali%20Ibrahim\"&gt;Abdel Rahman Ali Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"David%20Owino\"&gt;David Owino&lt;/a&gt; cross. The game remained open for the remainder of the first half and the beginning of the second half, but Wanga stepped forward again to seal the win for the Harambee Stars. In the 69th minute, Wanga beat &lt;a href=\"El%20Tahir%20El%20Hag\"&gt;El Tahir El Hag&lt;/a&gt; to get on the end of a low cross from his &lt;a href=\"A.F.C.%20Leopards\"&gt;A.F.C. Leopards&lt;/a&gt; teammate &lt;a href=\"James%20Situma\"&gt;James Situma&lt;/a&gt; and slot it into the far post.\nThe match, alongside &lt;a href=\"2013%20CECAFA%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Quarter-final%204\"&gt;Sudan's quarter-final clash against Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;, produced the highest number of yellow cards in the tournament, with the highlights being &lt;a href=\"Amir%20Kamal\"&gt;Amir Kamal&lt;/a&gt;'s 44th-minute yellow card for a blatant push on &lt;a href=\"Aboud%20Omar\"&gt;Aboud Omar&lt;/a&gt;, who was booked in the 38th minute, and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Kiongera\"&gt;Paul Kiongera&lt;/a&gt;'s booking just seconds after coming on for &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Kahata\"&gt;Francis Kahata&lt;/a&gt;, 4 minutes into added time, for dissent. After the match, Wanga received the &lt;a href=\"Man%20of%20the%20Match\"&gt;Man of the Match&lt;/a&gt; award."
