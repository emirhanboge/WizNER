    "text": "German submarine \"U-2323\" was a &lt;a href=\"Type%20XXIII%20submarine\"&gt;Type XXIII submarine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. She was constructed at &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; during the spring of 1944, completed on the 18 July and given to \"Kptlt.\" Walter Angermann to command. A fast high-technology coastal boat, \"U-2323\" was expected to be the new war-winning weapon in the &lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt;'s arsenal.\nDesign.\nLike all &lt;a href=\"Type%20XXIII%20submarine\"&gt;Type XXIII&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt;s, \"U-2323\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of (&lt;a href=\"o/a\"&gt;o/a&lt;/a&gt;), a beam width of (o/a), and a draught depth of. The submarine was powered by one &lt;a href=\"MWM%20GmbH\"&gt;MWM&lt;/a&gt; six-cylinder RS134S diesel engine providing , one &lt;a href=\"AEG\"&gt;AEG&lt;/a&gt; GU4463-8 &lt;a href=\"Motor-generator\"&gt;double-acting electric motor&lt;/a&gt; electric motor providing , and one &lt;a href=\"Brown%2C%20Boveri%20%26amp%3B%20Cie\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silent%20running%20%28submarine%29\"&gt;silent running&lt;/a&gt; CCR188 electric motor providing .\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate at for ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"U-2323\" was fitted with two &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s in the bow. She could carry two preloaded &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es. The &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20company\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; was 14\u201318 men. This class of U-boat did not carry a deck gun.\nService history.\nThe seas around the German coastline were subject to very heavy allied attack during the final two years of the war, as the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; sought to restrict German movement around their coasts by sowing thousands of air-dropped &lt;a href=\"naval%20mines\"&gt;naval mines&lt;/a&gt;, thus delaying the production and training of new boats, disrupting coastal shipping and destroying several boats before they could become involved in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic\"&gt;Battle of the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"U-2323\" was a victim of this campaign, when on the 26 July 1944, just eight days old, she was sunk off &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B6ltenort\"&gt;M\u00f6ltenort&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt; harbour on her maiden voyage. Two of her crew were killed in the blast, although the survivors managed to safely reach the shore. They were then transferred to other units. The holed boat was raised in early 1945, but was still undergoing repairs in Kiel at the time of the German surrender. It was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt; \"in situ\" post-war."
