    "text": "Martin A. \"Marty\" Knutson (May 31, 1930 - December 11, 2013) served as Director of Flight Operations for &lt;a href=\"NASA\"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ames%20Research%20Center\"&gt;Ames Research Center&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Moffett%20Field\"&gt;Moffett Field&lt;/a&gt;, CA, and also as site manager of the &lt;a href=\"Ames-Dryden%20Flight%20Research%20Facility\"&gt;Ames-Dryden Flight Research Facility&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Edwards Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; in CA, at that time a satellite facility of Ames, from May 1984 through late 1990.\nBorn in St. Louis Park, he attended the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Minnesota\"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, majoring in electrical engineering. Knutson joined the U.S. Navy, before transferring to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt; as an aviation &lt;a href=\"cadet\"&gt;cadet&lt;/a&gt; in 1950. Following service in Korea and participation in developmental testing and operational missions in the &lt;a href=\"F-84\"&gt;F-84&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"F-86\"&gt;F-86&lt;/a&gt;, he was recruited to fly the &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20U-2\"&gt;U-2&lt;/a&gt; reconnaissance aircraft for the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; in 1955. He was assigned to Det A, the first U-2 detachment to deploy operationally.\nOn July 9, 1956 he flew the third overflight of the USSR, Mission 2020 in a U-2A. The sortie from Wiesbaden took him over Berlin, Riga, Kaunas, Vilnius and Minsk. After re-assignment to Det B he flew Operation TOUCHDOWN, the 20th Soviet overflight, exactly three years later, (also in a U-2A). This mission was launched from Peshawar, Pakistan and landed nine hours later in the Iranian desert. He retired from the USAF in 1970.\nKnutson joined NASA in 1971 as manager of U-2 flight operations at Ames and was one of several pilots who flew the aircraft on Earth resources science missions. He later flew the &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20U-2%23ER-2%20details\"&gt;ER-2&lt;/a&gt;, an updated model of the U-2 that remains in service at NASA Dryden today.\nDuring Knutson's six years at Dryden he maintained the facility at operational readiness for space shuttle landings and replaced Dryden's aging fleet of &lt;a href=\"F-104\"&gt;F-104&lt;/a&gt; support aircraft with &lt;a href=\"F/A-18%20Hornet\"&gt;F/A-18 Hornet&lt;/a&gt;s. He also provided leadership for numerous flight research projects including the &lt;a href=\"X-29\"&gt;X-29&lt;/a&gt; forward-swept-wing technology demonstrator; the &lt;a href=\"Controlled%20Impact%20Demonstration\"&gt;Controlled Impact Demonstration&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"F-15\"&gt;F-15&lt;/a&gt; Digital Electronic Engine Control project that integrated propulsion and flight controls, the &lt;a href=\"Pegasus%20%28rocket%29\"&gt;Pegasus&lt;/a&gt; air-launched rocket for placing small payloads into &lt;a href=\"low-Earth%20orbit\"&gt;low-Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"CV-990\"&gt;CV-990&lt;/a&gt; Landing Systems Research aircraft that tested improved braking systems for the &lt;a href=\"space%20shuttle\"&gt;space shuttle&lt;/a&gt;; and the F-18 &lt;a href=\"High%20Alpha%20Research%20Vehicle\"&gt;High Alpha Research Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Air Force announced the impending retirement of the &lt;a href=\"SR-71%20Blackbird\"&gt;SR-71 Blackbird&lt;/a&gt;, Knutson successfully sought to acquire three of the airplanes for Dryden. In late 1990 he returned to Ames where he served as chief of flight operations until his retirement in 1997.\nHis awards include the &lt;a href=\"Meritorious%20Service%20Medal%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Meritorious Service Medal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Distinguished Flying Cross&lt;/a&gt;, both from the Air Force, NASA's Outstanding Leadership Award, and the Presidential Rank of Meritorious Executive. He was an Associate Fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and a charter member of the federal government's Senior Executive Service.\nReferences.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/Biographies/Directors/knutson.html\"&gt;NASA Dryden Center Director Biography: Martin A.
