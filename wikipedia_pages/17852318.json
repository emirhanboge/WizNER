    "text": "Ferenc Nagy (27 October 1916 \u2013 11 May 1977) was a &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boxing\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt; who competed in the &lt;a href=\"1936%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1936 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Cegl%C3%A9d\"&gt;Cegl\u00e9d&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1936 he finished fourth in the &lt;a href=\"Boxing%20at%20the%201936%20Summer%20Olympics%20-%20Men%27s%20heavyweight\"&gt;heavyweight class&lt;/a&gt;. After his win in the quarterfinals against &lt;a href=\"Olle%20Tandberg\"&gt;Olle Tandberg&lt;/a&gt; he was neither able to fight in the semifinal bout to &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Runge\"&gt;Herbert Runge&lt;/a&gt; nor in the bronze medal bout to &lt;a href=\"Erling%20Nilsen\"&gt;Erling Nilsen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe wasn't able to fight for the medal because he was locked in to the locker room and his trainer was ordered to throw in the towel. There was a clear political reason behind this and sadly the medal placement was already decided. \nSee reference Cegled Sport torteneti Muzem**."
