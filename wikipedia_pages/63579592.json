    "text": "Bob Hogg was a &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player. He was the 71st President of the Scottish Rugby Union.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe played for &lt;a href=\"Gala%20RFC\"&gt;Gala&lt;/a&gt; and he captained the First XV in 1936.\nAdministrative career.\nHe was elected on the &lt;a href=\"Gala%20RFC\"&gt;Gala&lt;/a&gt; committee in 1929.\nHe was Honorary Treasurer of &lt;a href=\"Gala%20RFC\"&gt;Gala&lt;/a&gt; in 1935.\nHogg was involved with the &lt;a href=\"Border%20League\"&gt;Border League&lt;/a&gt; as Secretary; and also held the post of Secretary of the South District Union. He was described as the most 'acute of these [secretaries], wearing his two hats with vast aplomb from 1928 to 1949.'\nThe book \"Rummle them up! The Border Rugby Story\" explains the difficulties of holding the Border League and District Union post at the same time:\n[The secretary] could never allow his left hand to know what his right hand was doing. League and Union representatives would meet in the same place on the same night, in a quorum composed of much the same people, but the secretary kept two minute books, one for Union eyes, the other strictly for home consumption in the League. \nAt a &lt;a href=\"Gala%20RFC\"&gt;Gala&lt;/a&gt; rugby dinner as SRU representative, Hogg responded to a question about the press picking the Scotland international team instead of the SRU selection committee. His response was scathing of the press:\nIt would be a revelation to see the team chosen by experts of the Press, especially if the responsibility was on their shoulders. It must be apparent to the public that the sensational titbits which appeared about rugby football, were, with a few exceptions. only a prostitution of the game. They wrote their puerile nonsense about the game for personal gain, and a friend of his had ranked them as second rate prostitutes. Personally, he only disagreed with that in a matter of degree; he would say they were third rate!\nHogg was elected Vice-President of the SRU in 1956.\nHe became the 71st President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He served the standard one year from &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Scottish%20Rugby%20Union%20Presidents\"&gt;1957 to 1958&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutside of rugby union.\nHogg was made the Chairman of the committee for the &lt;a href=\"Galashiels\"&gt;Galashiels&lt;/a&gt; festival, the Braw Lads Gathering, in 1939."
