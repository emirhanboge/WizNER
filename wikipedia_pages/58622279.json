    "text": "Aspergillus udagawae is a &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of fungus in the &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Aspergillus\"&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/a&gt;\". It is from the \"Fumigati\" section. Several fungi from this section produce heat-resistant &lt;a href=\"ascospore\"&gt;ascospore&lt;/a&gt;s, and the isolates from this section are frequently obtained from locations where natural fires have previously occurred. The species was first described in 1995. It has been reported to produce fumagillin, fumigaclavine A and C, fumigatins, fumiquinazolin F or G, helvolic acid, monomethylsulochrin, pyripyropene A, E, trypacidin, tryptoquivalines, and tryptoquivalones.\nGrowth and morphology.\n\"A. udagawae\" has been cultivated on both Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) plates and Malt Extract Agar Oxoid\u00ae (MEAOX) plates. The growth morphology of the colonies can be seen in the pictures below."
