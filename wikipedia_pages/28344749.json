    "text": "Aboisso Department is a &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20Ivory%20Coast\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sud-Como%C3%A9%20Region\"&gt;Sud-Como\u00e9 Region&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Como%C3%A9%20District\"&gt;Como\u00e9 District&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Coast\"&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014, its population was 307,852 and its seat is the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Aboisso\"&gt;Aboisso&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"sub-prefectures%20of%20Ivory%20Coast\"&gt;sub-prefectures&lt;/a&gt; of the department are &lt;a href=\"Aboisso\"&gt;Aboisso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adaou\"&gt;Adaou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adjouan\"&gt;Adjouan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayam%C3%A9\"&gt;Ayam\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bianouan\"&gt;Bianouan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kouakro\"&gt;Kouakro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maf%C3%A9r%C3%A9\"&gt;Maf\u00e9r\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yaou%2C%20Ivory%20Coast\"&gt;Yaou&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAboisso Department was created in 1969 as one of the 24 new departments that were created to take the place of the six departments that were being abolished. It was created from territory that was formerly part of &lt;a href=\"Sud%20Department%20%28Ivory%20Coast%29\"&gt;Sud Department&lt;/a&gt;. Using current boundaries as a reference, the new department occupied all of what today is &lt;a href=\"Sud-Como%C3%A9%20Region\"&gt;Sud-Como\u00e9 Region&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1997, &lt;a href=\"regions%20of%20Ivory%20Coast\"&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; were introduced as new first-level subdivisions of Ivory Coast; as a result, all departments were converted into second-level subdivisions. The territory of Aboisso Department was co-extensive with that of the new &lt;a href=\"Sud-Como%C3%A9%20Region\"&gt;Sud-Como\u00e9 Region&lt;/a&gt;, which created a need to divide the department to avoid having completely overlapping first- and second-level subdivision. In 1998, Aboisso Department was split into three parts in order to create &lt;a href=\"Adiak%C3%A9%20Department\"&gt;Adiak\u00e9 Department&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand-Bassam%20Department\"&gt;Grand-Bassam Department&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2011, &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Ivory%20Coast\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt; were introduced as new first-level subdivisions of Ivory Coast. At the same time, regions were reorganised and became second-level subdivisions and all departments were converted into third-level subdivisions. At this time, Aboisso Department remained part of the retained &lt;a href=\"Sud-Como%C3%A9%20Region\"&gt;Sud-Como\u00e9 Region&lt;/a&gt; in the new &lt;a href=\"Como%C3%A9%20District\"&gt;Como\u00e9 District&lt;/a&gt;."
