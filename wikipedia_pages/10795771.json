    "text": "Vengeur (\"Avenger\") was a &lt;a href=\"first-rate\"&gt;first-rate&lt;/a&gt; 118-gun &lt;a href=\"ship%20of%20the%20line\"&gt;ship of the line&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Oc%C3%A9an%20type%20118-gun%20ship%20of%20the%20line\"&gt;\"Oc\u00e9an\" type&lt;/a&gt;, designed by &lt;a href=\"Jacques-No%C3%ABl%20San%C3%A9\"&gt;Jacques-No\u00ebl San\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. She was the first ship in French service to sport &lt;a href=\"18-pounder%20long%20gun\"&gt;18-pounder long gun&lt;/a&gt;s on her third deck, instead of the lighter &lt;a href=\"12-pounder%20long%20gun\"&gt;12-pounder long gun&lt;/a&gt;s used before for this role.\nCareer.\nLaid down as \"Peuple\" in covered basin no.3 at Brest Dockyard in October 1793, she was renamed as \"Vengeur\" after the &lt;a href=\"Glorious%20First%20of%20June\"&gt;Bataille du 13 prairial an 2&lt;/a&gt; in honour of the &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Vengeur%20du%20Peuple\"&gt;\"Vengeur du Peuple\"&lt;/a&gt; by a decree passed by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Convention\"&gt;National Convention&lt;/a&gt;. She was launched on 1 October 1803 and completed in February 1804. She was again renamed in March 1805, becoming \"Imp\u00e9rial\".\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Third%20Coalition\"&gt;War of the Third Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, \"Imp\u00e9rial\" was the &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Squadron%20%28naval%29\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; under the overall command of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20admiral\"&gt;Vice-Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Corentin-Urbain%20Leiss%C3%A8gues\"&gt;Corentin-Urbain Leiss\u00e8gues&lt;/a&gt; which was part of a larger French force that sailed from &lt;a href=\"Brest%2C%20France\"&gt;Brest&lt;/a&gt;, France, on 13 December 1805 for what was planned as a 14-month cruise to attack British &lt;a href=\"merchant%20ship\"&gt;merchant ship&lt;/a&gt;ping while avoiding combat with major &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; forces. On 15 December 1805, the French force split into two squadrons which proceeded independently from one another. \nAboard \"Imp\u00e9rial\", Leiss\u00e8gues led his squadron across the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; bound for the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. After encountering a storm off the &lt;a href=\"Azores\"&gt;Azores&lt;/a&gt; in late December 1805, \"Imp\u00e9rial\" and most of the squadron arrived at French-held &lt;a href=\"Santo%20Domingo\"&gt;Santo Domingo&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Hispaniola\"&gt;Hispaniola&lt;/a&gt; on 20 January 1806, where Leiss\u00e8gues ordered the ships to be &lt;a href=\"Caulking\"&gt;recaulked&lt;/a&gt; after their long and difficult &lt;a href=\"transatlantic%20voyage\"&gt;transatlantic voyage&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the morning of 6 February 1806, a Royal Navy squadron under the command of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;Vice-Admiral&lt;/a&gt; Sir &lt;a href=\"John%20Thomas%20Duckworth\"&gt;John Thomas Duckworth&lt;/a&gt; arrived off Santo Domingo to attack Leiss\u00e8gues\u2032s force. Leiss\u00e8gues was conducting business ashore when the British squadron was sighted, and the French force was delayed in getting underway while it awaited his return to \"Imp\u00e9rial\". Several of Leiss\u00e8gues\u2032s ships were not yet ready for sea, but once aboard \"Imp\u00e9rial\", Leiss\u00e8gues ordered his ships to get underway and sail westward along the coast of Hispaniola toward &lt;a href=\"Nizao\"&gt;Nizao&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the resulting &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20San%20Domingo\"&gt;Battle of San Domingo&lt;/a&gt;, the French squadron maintained close formation, and the five French ships of the line formed a &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20battle\"&gt;line of battle&lt;/a&gt; with \"Imp\u00e9rial\" second in line behind &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Indivisible%20%281799%29\"&gt;\"Alexandre\"&lt;/a&gt; and ahead of &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Union%20%281799%29\"&gt;\"Diom\u00e8de\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Viala%20%281795%29\"&gt;\"Jupiter\"&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"French%20ship%20Cassard%20%281795%29\"&gt;\"Brave\"&lt;/a&gt;. Duckworth ordered his squadron to concentrate fire on the three leading French ships of the line, and accordingly the flagship of &lt;a href=\"Rear%20admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29\"&gt;Rear-Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Cochrane\"&gt;Alexander Cochrane&lt;/a&gt;, the British &lt;a href=\"74-gun\"&gt;74-gun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Third%20rate\"&gt;third-rate&lt;/a&gt; ship of the line , engaged \"Imp\u00e9rial\" closely, while another 74-gun third rate, , opened fire on \"Imp\u00e9rial\" and \"Diom\u00e8de\" simultaneously. As the engagement at the head of the French line became confused, with ships of the two sides intermingled and smoke restricting visibility, \"Imp\u00e9rial\" engaged and threatened to overwhelm Duckworth\u2032s flagship, the 74-gun third rate , which was leading the British line, but Cochrane placed \"Northumberland\" in between \"Imp\u00e9rial\" and \"Superb\" in an effort to protect \"Superb.\" \"Imp\u00e9rial\" inflicted severe damage on \"Northumberland\", with some of her shots passing through \"Northumberland\" and striking \"Superb\". As the battle continued, \"Imp\u00e9rial\" became increasingly isolated. The 98-gun &lt;a href=\"Second%20rate\"&gt;second-rate&lt;/a&gt; ship of the line steered toward \"Imp\u00e9rial\", fired two &lt;a href=\"Broadside%20%28naval%29\"&gt;broadside&lt;/a&gt;s into her, and then &lt;a href=\"Raking%20fire\"&gt;raked&lt;/a&gt; her. \"Atlas\"\u2032s &lt;a href=\"tiller\"&gt;tiller&lt;/a&gt; then jammed and she was engaged by \"Diom\u00e8de\" and the damaged \"Northumberland\" drifted out of the action, but the rest of the British squadron concentrated its fire on \"Imp\u00e9rial\". \"Imp\u00e9rial\"\u2032s &lt;a href=\"mainmast\"&gt;mainmast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mizzenmast\"&gt;mizzenmast&lt;/a&gt; collapsed, most of her guns had been silenced, and she was losing her ability to maneuver, and Leiss\u00e8gues ordered her to turn toward shore. Pursued by the 84-gun third-rate ship of the line , \"Imp\u00e9rial\" ran hard aground parallel to the beach on a &lt;a href=\"coral%20reef\"&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of Hispaniola between Nizao and &lt;a href=\"Point%20Catalan\"&gt;Point Catalan&lt;/a&gt;, suffering severe &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28ship%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; damage and losing all of her &lt;a href=\"Mast%20%28ship%29\"&gt;masts&lt;/a&gt;. The similarly damaged \"Diom\u00e8de\" ran aground nearby. As the British ships moved out of gunnery range, the crews of \"Imp\u00e9rial\" and \"Diom\u00e8de\" assembled on deck to abandon ship. \"Imp\u00e9rial\" had suffered about 500 casualties.\nLeiss\u00e8gues ordered \"Diom\u00e8de\" and \"Imp\u00e9rial\" burned as soon as their crews had completed their abandonment of the ships, but before that order could be carried out, boat crews from the &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20rate\"&gt;fifth-rate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sailing%20frigate\"&gt;frigates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"French%20frigate%20Magicienne%20%281778%29\"&gt;HMS \"Magicienne\"&lt;/a&gt; boarded them on 8 February 1806 and captured them without meeting any resistance. The British boarding party took six prisoners aboard \"Imp\u00e9rial\" and then burned her wreck."
