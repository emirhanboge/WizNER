    "text": "St Philip's Church is in the village of &lt;a href=\"Alderley%20Edge\"&gt;Alderley Edge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cheshire\"&gt;Cheshire&lt;/a&gt;, England. The church is recorded in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England\"&gt;National Heritage List for England&lt;/a&gt; as a designated Grade\u00a0II* &lt;a href=\"Listed%20building%23England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt;. It is an active &lt;a href=\"Anglican\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"parish%20church\"&gt;parish church&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"diocese%20of%20Chester\"&gt;diocese of Chester&lt;/a&gt;, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Knutsford. The architectural historian &lt;a href=\"Nikolaus%20Pevsner\"&gt;Nikolaus Pevsner&lt;/a&gt; described it as \"large, ambitious, and unmistakably prosperous-looking\".\nHistory.\nSt Philip's was designed by the &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; architect &lt;a href=\"J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BS.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BCrowther\"&gt;J.\u00a0S.\u00a0Crowther&lt;/a&gt;, and was his first independent work. It originated in 1851\u201352 when the &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt;, the south &lt;a href=\"aisle\"&gt;aisle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"chancel\"&gt;chancel&lt;/a&gt; were built. In 1856\u201357 the north aisle, a further &lt;a href=\"bay%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;bay&lt;/a&gt; on the west of the church, and a &lt;a href=\"Steeple%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;steeple&lt;/a&gt; to the south of the church, were added. A &lt;a href=\"vestry\"&gt;vestry&lt;/a&gt; was added in 1903 to a design by F.\u00a0P.\u00a0Oakley.\nArchitecture.\nExterior.\nThe church is built in hammer-dressed &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rubble\"&gt;rubble&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"ashlar\"&gt;ashlar&lt;/a&gt; dressings. The &lt;a href=\"slate\"&gt;slate&lt;/a&gt; roof is in bands of three colours. Its architectural style is &lt;a href=\"English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Decorated%20Gothic\"&gt;Decorated&lt;/a&gt;. The plan of the church consists of a six-&lt;a href=\"Bay%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;bay&lt;/a&gt; nave with north and south aisles, each under its own ridge, a three-bay &lt;a href=\"chancel\"&gt;chancel&lt;/a&gt;, a hexagonal vestry, and a southwest tower with a spire. The tower is in four stages with angle &lt;a href=\"buttress\"&gt;buttress&lt;/a&gt;es and the spire has three levels of &lt;a href=\"lucarne\"&gt;lucarne&lt;/a&gt;s.\nInterior.\nIn the north wall of the chancel is a &lt;a href=\"sedilia\"&gt;sedilia&lt;/a&gt;, and in the south wall is a &lt;a href=\"piscina\"&gt;piscina&lt;/a&gt;. The carved &lt;a href=\"reredos\"&gt;reredos&lt;/a&gt; of 1903 depicts the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Supper\"&gt;Last Supper&lt;/a&gt;. The choir stalls, &lt;a href=\"pulpit\"&gt;pulpit&lt;/a&gt; and organ screen, all dated 1907, are panelled. These were designed by &lt;a href=\"Percy%20Worthington\"&gt;Percy Worthington&lt;/a&gt;. In the south aisle is a stained glass window made by &lt;a href=\"Morris%20%26amp%3B%20Co.\"&gt;Morris &amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt; dating from 1873. These include figures designed by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Burne-Jones\"&gt;Edward Burne-Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Madox%20Brown\"&gt;Ford Madox Brown&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere are windows dating from 1933 to 1935 by &lt;a href=\"James%20Powell%20and%20Sons\"&gt;Powells&lt;/a&gt;. The three-&lt;a href=\"manual%20%28music%29\"&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; organ was built by Wadsworth of &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; and was rebuilt in 1962 by Jardine and Company, also of Manchester."
