    "text": "Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb District () was one of the 36 &lt;a href=\"districts%20of%20Albania\"&gt;districts of Albania&lt;/a&gt;, which were dissolved in July 2000 and replaced by 12 &lt;a href=\"Counties%20of%20Albania\"&gt;counties&lt;/a&gt;. It had a population of 35,571 in 2001, and an area of , making it the smallest district of Albania. It is in the centre of the country, and its capital was the former &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Albania\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ku%C3%A7ov%C3%AB\"&gt;Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; (which in 2015 became a sub-unit of the larger municipality of the same name). Its territory is now part of &lt;a href=\"Berat%20County\"&gt;Berat County&lt;/a&gt;: the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Ku%C3%A7ov%C3%AB\"&gt;Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; (partly).\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe district consists of the following &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Albania\"&gt;municipalities&lt;/a&gt;:\nNote: - urban municipalities in bold\nDescription.\nKu\u00e7ov\u00eb is one of the main centres of the &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Industry%20%28economics%29\"&gt;industry&lt;/a&gt;, and the town of Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb was built with &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; assistance in the 1950s. It is of interest to &lt;a href=\"student\"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"planning\"&gt;planning&lt;/a&gt;, although much of the oil &lt;a href=\"infrastructure\"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; predates the communist period and was installed by the &lt;a href=\"Italians\"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt; during the Zogist period. Today all of the &lt;a href=\"oil%20well\"&gt;oil well&lt;/a&gt;s are functioning, and in some places oil seeps to the surface. Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb has had the largest Oil reserves in Albania and there is currently a lot of Oil unexplored. The Communist regime build Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb into an industrial city, among the most industrialized in the country, but the current regime, just takes the Oil produced there and doesn't invest any money in its infrastructure.\nThe town has suffered very badly during the &lt;a href=\"post-communist\"&gt;post-communist&lt;/a&gt; period, and there are many abandoned &lt;a href=\"factory\"&gt;factories&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"power%20plant\"&gt;power plant&lt;/a&gt;s in and around the town, and it is visibly poorer than the neighbouring towns such as &lt;a href=\"Berat\"&gt;Berat&lt;/a&gt;. There is little to interest the casual &lt;a href=\"tourist\"&gt;tourist&lt;/a&gt;, and facilities for the visitor are poor even by local standards - tourists would be better advised to explore Kucove from Berat.\nKu\u00e7ov\u00eb was formerly a closed &lt;a href=\"military\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"district\"&gt;district&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"airbase\"&gt;airbase&lt;/a&gt; at Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb remains one of the largest in Albania and aged &lt;a href=\"MiG\"&gt;MiG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20aircraft\"&gt;fighters&lt;/a&gt; of 1950s vintage could be seen flying on a regular basis until they were finally grounded in late 2005."
