Sardina's interest in music started at a young age. At the age of 6, he secretly played his younger sister's guitar and later told his mother he wanted to become a professional musician.\nHis parents moved to &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego\"&gt;San Diego, California&lt;/a&gt; when he was 15. After a couple of months, Sardina returned to Spain, finished school and started playing in bands. His first experience in a recording studio was at the age of 16, when he attended a recording session of his cousin's band in &lt;a href=\"San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n\"&gt;San Sebasti\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;.\nSardina joined medical school at age 16.

During his fourth year of school and right before taking the final exam, Sardina decided to drop out. He saved up for a three-week recording certification program at &lt;a href=\"Recording%20Workshop\"&gt;The Recording Workshop&lt;/a&gt; school in &lt;a href=\"Chillicothe%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Chillicothe, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. Sardina then went back to Spain and continued saving until he enrolled in a program at &lt;a href=\"Full%20Sail%20University\"&gt;Full Sail University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orlando%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Orlando, Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1993, four weeks before graduating with a Valedictorian Award, Sardina organized a 24-hour trip to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. He did interviews at &lt;a href=\"Record%20Plant\"&gt;Record Plant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westlake%20Recording%20Studios\"&gt;Westlake Recording Studios&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Way%20Recording\"&gt;Ocean Way Recording&lt;/a&gt;, where he later started working and became assistant engineer.

AfterHours was first located at his previous house. Sardina describes it as being \"just a tiny room, tracking little things like drums in the hallway\".\nThe studio is now located in &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Woodland Hills, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, where he remodeled a two story three-car garage and an adjacent room. The live room, control room and isolation booth are on the first floor, while an office and a lounge are located on the second floor. The studio operates around a &lt;a href=\"Solid%20State%20Logic\"&gt;Solid State Logic&lt;/a&gt; Duality console and incorporates multiple &lt;a href=\"Effects%20unit\"&gt;outboard processors&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Digital%20audio%20workstation\"&gt;digital recording system&lt;/a&gt;. The studio was featured on &lt;a href=\"Mix%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Mix Magazine's&lt;/a&gt; Class of 2017."
