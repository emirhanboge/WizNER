    "text": "The 7th Infantry Division is a war-formed &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt;, part of the Indian Army that saw service in the &lt;a href=\"Burma%20Campaign\"&gt;Burma Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe division was created on 1 October 1940 at &lt;a href=\"Attock\"&gt;Attock&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Major-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Major General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Wakely%20%28Indian%20Army%20officer%29\"&gt;Arthur Wakely&lt;/a&gt;. Its formation sign was an arrow, pointing bottom left to top right, in yellow on a black background. The division was sometimes known as the \"Golden Arrow\" division from this sign. When first formed, the division consisted of the &lt;a href=\"13th%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade\"&gt;13th&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"14th%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade\"&gt;14th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"16th%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade\"&gt;16th Indian Infantry Brigade&lt;/a&gt;s, but within eighteen months, both the 13th and 16th Brigades were removed and dispatched to &lt;a href=\"Burma\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;, where both fought during the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20conquest%20of%20Burma\"&gt;Japanese conquest of Burma&lt;/a&gt;. The 14th Brigade was renumbered the &lt;a href=\"114th%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade\"&gt;114th Indian Infantry Brigade&lt;/a&gt; and remained with the division.\nDuring 1942, the &lt;a href=\"33rd%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade\"&gt;33rd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"89th%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade\"&gt;89th Brigades&lt;/a&gt; were added to the division. The division trained for operations in the deserts in the Middle East but by the end of the year, the &lt;a href=\"North%20African%20campaign\"&gt;North African campaign&lt;/a&gt; was clearly at an end. In early 1943, the division was reassigned to the &lt;a href=\"Burma%20campaign\"&gt;Burma campaign&lt;/a&gt; and Major General &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Messervy\"&gt;Frank Messervy&lt;/a&gt;, a veteran of the fighting in North Africa, was appointed to command, replacing Major General &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Corbett%20%28Indian%20Army%20officer%29\"&gt;Thomas Corbett&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter extensive retraining and preparation, 7th Division took part in an offensive in &lt;a href=\"Rakhine%20State\"&gt;Arakan&lt;/a&gt;, the coastal province of Burma. Starting in December 1943, the division advanced down the Kalapanzin River valley as part of &lt;a href=\"XV%20Corps%20%28British%20India%29\"&gt;XV Corps&lt;/a&gt;. In February 1944, Japanese troops infiltrated through the division's front and overran the divisional HQ. Units of the division took part in the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Admin%20Box\"&gt;Battle of the Admin Box&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Japanese failed to capture positions supplied by parachute drops and were forced to retreat.\nDuring March, the Japanese launched a major offensive (codenamed &lt;a href=\"Operation%20U-Go\"&gt;Operation U-Go&lt;/a&gt;) into &lt;a href=\"Manipur\"&gt;Manipur&lt;/a&gt;. Having been withdrawn from the Arakan battles, the division proceeded by road and rail to &lt;a href=\"Dimapur\"&gt;Dimapur&lt;/a&gt;, where it came under command of &lt;a href=\"XXXIII%20Corps%20%28British%20India%29\"&gt;XXXIII Corps&lt;/a&gt; and took part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kohima\"&gt;Battle of Kohima&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"161st%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade\"&gt;161st Indian Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, part of the &lt;a href=\"5th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28India%29\"&gt;5th Indian Division&lt;/a&gt;, came under command, while the 89th Brigade was flown to Imphal, to replace 161st Brigade in 5th Division. During early May, 33rd Brigade completed the recapture of Kohima Ridge, while the main body of the division recaptured Naga Village to the north of the ridge. During the later part of the month and early June, the division advanced through heavy &lt;a href=\"monsoon\"&gt;monsoon&lt;/a&gt; rains along rough tracks to the east of the main road from Kohima to Imphal, and cleared Japanese stragglers from &lt;a href=\"Ukhrul\"&gt;Ukhrul&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom July to October, the division regrouped near Kohima, and 89th Brigade rejoined. Late in 1944, Major General Messervy was promoted to command &lt;a href=\"IV%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;IV Corps&lt;/a&gt; and was replaced in command of the division by Major General &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20Charles%20Evans\"&gt;Geoffrey Charles Evans&lt;/a&gt;. Now commanded by IV Corps, the division advanced down the Gangaw Valley west of the &lt;a href=\"Chindwin%20River\"&gt;Chindwin River&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"28th%20%28East%20Africa%29%20Brigade\"&gt;28th (East Africa) Brigade&lt;/a&gt; under command, screened until &lt;a href=\"Pauk\"&gt;Pauk&lt;/a&gt; was reached by the lightly equipped &lt;a href=\"Lushai%20Brigade\"&gt;Lushai Brigade&lt;/a&gt;. During late February 1945, the division captured vital bridgeheads across the &lt;a href=\"Irrawaddy%20River\"&gt;Irrawaddy River&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Pakokku\"&gt;Pakokku&lt;/a&gt;. During March, as part of the decisive &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Central%20Burma\"&gt;Battle of Central Burma&lt;/a&gt;, the division was involved in several battles at &lt;a href=\"Myingyan\"&gt;Myingyan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yenangyaung\"&gt;Yenangyaung&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring April, the division once again came under command of XXXIII Corps and advanced down the west bank of the Irrawaddy. After &lt;a href=\"Yangon\"&gt;Rangoon&lt;/a&gt;, the capital, was captured in early May, the division was directly commanded by the new headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Twelfth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Twelfth Army&lt;/a&gt; and resisted Japanese diversionary attacks across the &lt;a href=\"Sittang%20River\"&gt;Sittang River&lt;/a&gt; during the monsoon.\nAfter the war ended, in September 1945, the division moved to &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, where it disarmed the Japanese occupying army, and liberated and repatriated Allied prisoners of war.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Partition%20of%20India\"&gt;Partition of India&lt;/a&gt; in 1947 the 7th Division local units were split between India and Pakistan, and both armies continue to have a 7th Infantry Division with the Golden Arrow formation sign.\nAssigned brigades.\nAll these brigades were assigned or attached to the division at some time during World War II."
