    "text": "Antonio Tavaris Brown Sr. (born July 10, 1988) is an &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wide%20receiver\"&gt;wide receiver&lt;/a&gt; who is a free agent. Raised in &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20City%20%28Miami%29\"&gt;Liberty City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miami\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, Brown attended &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Norland%20High%20School\"&gt;Miami Norland High School&lt;/a&gt;. He played &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Central%20Michigan%20Chippewas%20football\"&gt;Central Michigan University&lt;/a&gt;, where he earned All-American honors in 2008 and 2009 as a punt returner. A sixth-round pick in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2010 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;, Brown amassed more receptions than any other player in the league from his rookie season in 2010 through 2018.\nDuring Brown's first season with the Steelers, the team advanced to &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XLV\"&gt;Super Bowl XLV&lt;/a&gt; but lost to the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20Packers\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt;. He finished his rookie season with 16 receptions for 167 yards in ten games. During his second NFL season, he became the first player in NFL history to have more than 1,000 yards receiving and returning in the same year. For his efforts, Brown was selected as a punt returner for the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;2012 Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, he became the only receiver in NFL history to record five receptions and at least 50 yards in every single game of an NFL season. Although his on-the-field productivity continued over the next several seasons, including leading the league in receptions and receiving yards in 2014, receptions in 2015, receiving yards in 2017, and receiving touchdowns in 2018, Brown's relationship with the Steelers soured, especially with quarterback &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Roethlisberger\"&gt;Ben Roethlisberger&lt;/a&gt;, and he eventually requested a trade.\nIn 2019, Brown was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Raiders\"&gt;Oakland Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, who then made him the highest-paid receiver in the league. However, his time in Oakland was short-lived, and following several off-the-field incidents, including a confrontation with general manager &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Mayock\"&gt;Mike Mayock&lt;/a&gt;, the team released Brown without him ever playing a regular-season game with the team. Brown signed with the &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20Patriots\"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt; shortly thereafter but was cut after appearing in just one game. At the time, the NFL was investigating &lt;a href=\"sexual%20assault\"&gt;sexual assault&lt;/a&gt; allegations made against him. After spending the rest of 2019 and beginning of 2020 as a free agent, he signed with the &lt;a href=\"Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Tampa Bay Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, where he was part of the team that won &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20LV\"&gt;Super Bowl LV&lt;/a&gt;. He was released near the end of the 2021 season after stripping off his uniform and running off of the field during a game.\nEarly life.\nBrown is the son of retired &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Football%20League\"&gt;Arena Football League&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Brown%20%28arena%20football%29\"&gt;\"Touchdown\" Eddie Brown&lt;/a&gt;, who was named the best player in the league's history in 2006. Eddie Brown played wide receiver for the &lt;a href=\"Albany%20Firebirds\"&gt;Albany Firebirds&lt;/a&gt; and collegiate football for &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20Tech\"&gt;Louisiana Tech&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh school career.\nMiami Norland High School.\nBrown attended &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Norland%20High%20School\"&gt;Miami Norland High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Miami\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, where he played &lt;a href=\"high%20school%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"high%20school%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, Brown played &lt;a href=\"running%20back\"&gt;running back&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wide%20receiver\"&gt;wide receiver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"punt%20returner\"&gt;punt returner&lt;/a&gt; for the Vikings. He was a two-time Class 6A all-state selection and was also named North Athlete of the Year at 2005 Miami-Dade Gridiron Classic.\nNorth Carolina Tech Prep.\nComing out of high school, Brown applied to &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20University\"&gt;Florida State University&lt;/a&gt;. His admission was denied over academic concerns.\nAfter attempting to attend &lt;a href=\"Alcorn%20State%20University\"&gt;Alcorn State&lt;/a&gt;, he decided to enroll at North Carolina Tech Prep. Playing in just five games at quarterback, Brown passed for 1,247 yards and 11 touchdowns, while rushing for 451 yards and 13 touchdowns. Once he finished his lone season at North Carolina Tech Prep, he received a scholarship to play at &lt;a href=\"Florida%20International%20University\"&gt;Florida International University&lt;/a&gt;, but he was expelled before the season for an altercation with security. Brown then began reaching out to wide receivers coach &lt;a href=\"Butch%20Jones\"&gt;Butch Jones&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia%20University\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, since he had been highly recruited by him. After learning that Jones had left West Virginia to become the head coach at &lt;a href=\"Central%20Michigan%20University\"&gt;Central Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, Brown enrolled at the school and started his college football career as a walk-on freshman.\nCollege career.\nBrown attended and played college football for Central Michigan from 2007 to 2009.\nFreshman season.\nBrown began attending &lt;a href=\"Central%20Michigan%20University\"&gt;Central Michigan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2007%20Central%20Michigan%20Chippewas%20football%20team\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; after wide receivers coach &lt;a href=\"Zach%20Azzanni\"&gt;Zach Azzanni&lt;/a&gt; told him he could fly to Michigan and try out for the team as a &lt;a href=\"Walk-on%20%28sports%29\"&gt;walk-on&lt;/a&gt; wide receiver. Transitioning from the quarterback position in high school to wide receiver in college was not that difficult for him, and after a few weeks, Central Michigan coaches offered him a scholarship. Brown had difficulty adjusting to the college lifestyle, and being on time for meetings and practice. Azzanni and his wife helped him get situated and into an established routine, and he soon became like a part of their family. He made his collegiate debut against &lt;a href=\"2007%20Kansas%20Jayhawks%20football\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; on September 1. He had four receptions for 23 receiving yards in the 52\u20137 loss.

During his first season at Central Michigan, Brown played in 14 games. He played well enough to win the Mid-American Conference Freshman of the Year and was All-Conference as a returner. For his freshman season, he had 102 receptions for 1,003 yards and six touchdowns. His 102 receptions led the Mid-American Conference in 2007.\nSophomore season.\nBrown started every game during his sophomore season in &lt;a href=\"2008%20Central%20Michigan%20Chippewas%20football%20team\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;.

He was ranked as the 37th best wide receiver by NFLDraftScout.com and was invited to the NFL combine, where he completed the entire workout and all the positional drills. Brown participated at Central Michigan's Pro Day and decided to try to improve on his 10, 20, and 40-yard dash times after being unsatisfied with the numbers he clocked at the combine. He was able to improve his time in all three categories.\nUsing a pick received in a trade with the &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Cardinals\"&gt;Arizona Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; selected him in the sixth round with the 195th overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft.

After performing a similar dance in the end zone in Week 4 against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Kansas%20City%20Chiefs%20season\"&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt;, Brown was fined $24,309. The second fine was largely criticized by sportswriters, who considered it much too steep a penalty for a celebration. The league reasoned that the dances were \"sexually suggestive\".\nDuring Week 3 in a 34\u20133 loss to the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Philadelphia%20Eagles\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;, Brown moved into the NFL top 100 all-time for career receptions, and in Week 9 against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Baltimore%20Ravens\"&gt;Baltimore Ravens&lt;/a&gt;, he joined the top 100 for career receiving yards.

After the game, Brown broadcast the team's locker room celebration on &lt;a href=\"Facebook%20Live\"&gt;Facebook Live&lt;/a&gt; in violation of NFL rules and despite the requests of teammates &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Roethlisberger\"&gt;Ben Roethlisberger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ramon%20Foster\"&gt;Ramon Foster&lt;/a&gt; to \"keep a low profile on social media\". The broadcast included head coach &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Tomlin\"&gt;Mike Tomlin&lt;/a&gt; speaking crudely about championship round opponent &lt;a href=\"2016%20New%20England%20Patriots%20season\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;, for which Tomlin later apologized and disciplined Brown.

Shortly after the Steelers' 27\u201324 loss to the &lt;a href=\"AFC%20East\"&gt;AFC East&lt;/a&gt;-clinching Patriots, it was revealed that Brown's left calf was partially torn, meaning that he would not play for the rest of the regular season, but would return during the playoffs.
