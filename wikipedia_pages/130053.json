    "text": "Caddo is a town in &lt;a href=\"Bryan%20County%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Bryan County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The population was 997 at the 2010 census, a 5.6 percent gain over the figure of 944 recorded in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%2C%202000\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;. The name is derived from a Caddo word, \"ka do hada\u2019 cho\", meaning \"real chief\" in English. According to \"Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture\", the town was named for the nearby Caddo Hills.\nHistory.\nThe early inhabitants were Caddos and Choctaws, at least in the early 19th Century. A local legend says that the Caddos and the Choctaws had a fierce battle in 1840, about southeast of the site of present-day Caddo, The Choctaws won the battle, driving off the Caddos.\nAfter a patent for the land, located on a &lt;a href=\"American%20bison\"&gt;buffalo&lt;/a&gt; trail, was obtained in 1872, the first settlers lived in tents.\nIn 1872, the &lt;a href=\"Missouri-Kansas-Texas%20Railroad\"&gt;Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad&lt;/a&gt; (Katy) built a line through the Choctaw Nation and established a station at Caddo. A post office was opened December 18, 1872, and the railroad reached Denison, Texas by Christmas Day. In 1873, the town population was about four hundred people. Caddo quickly became a shipping and trade center for the surrounding area. By 1890, Caddo had five cotton gins and a population of 2,170. Caddo incorporated as a city in 1898. It was then the most populous town in the region.\nAt the time of its founding Caddo was located in &lt;a href=\"Blue%20County%2C%20Choctaw%20Nation\"&gt;Blue County&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the &lt;a href=\"Pushmataha%20District\"&gt;Pushmataha District&lt;/a&gt; of the Choctaw Nation.\nCaddo was on the route of the &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20Highway\"&gt;Jefferson Highway&lt;/a&gt; established in 1915, with that road running more than 2,300 miles from Winnipeg, Manitoba to New Orleans, Louisiana.\nWhen the St.Louis and San Francisco Railway (Frisco) planned to build an east-west line through the area, land prices jumped up. Frisco officials decided to build their line through &lt;a href=\"Durant%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Durant&lt;/a&gt; instead of Caddo. Durant then became the fastest-growing town, and became the county seat when Bryan County was formed at statehood. By 1930, Caddo's population had fallen to 933.\nIn 1943, Guy A. Crossett, the editor of The \"Caddo Herald\" newspaper described Caddo's decline. \u201cCaddo was a thriving town when Durant was a switch; when &lt;a href=\"Hugo%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; was a prairie; when &lt;a href=\"Madill%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Madill&lt;/a&gt; was unborn; when &lt;a href=\"Coalgate%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Coalgate&lt;/a&gt; was un-thought-of; when &lt;a href=\"Ardmore%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Ardmore&lt;/a&gt; was only in Pennsylvania; when &lt;a href=\"Idabel%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Idabel&lt;/a&gt; was yet to be; when &lt;a href=\"Atoka%2C%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Atoka&lt;/a&gt; was a small village. Yet all have outgrown us. The reason is plain. We did not elect a delegate to &lt;a href=\"William%20H.%20Murray\"&gt;Bill Murray&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s famous &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma%20Enabling%20Act\"&gt;Constitutional Convention&lt;/a&gt;; and tried to live upon the glories of the past. Finding out too late that we could not run the mill with water that has passed. Yet Caddo\u2019s part in the history of the state is honorable. That is secure. The future is another thing.\u201d\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, Caddo has a total area of , all land.\nDemographics.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2000, there were 944 people, 387 households, and 255 families residing in the town.
