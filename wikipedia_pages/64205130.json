    "text": "Sopronb\u00e1nfalva (), also known as B\u00e1nfalva, is a former &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; part of the &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sopron\"&gt;Sopron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, since 1950. Before 1945, the village had 3,304 inhabitants, with the majority being ethnic &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt;. However, many &lt;a href=\"Flight%20and%20expulsion%20of%20Germans%20%281944%E2%80%931950%29%23Hungary\"&gt;were deported&lt;/a&gt;, remaining only approximately 700 inhabitants after the event. This happened due to the desire to, among other things, secure the border with &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;."
