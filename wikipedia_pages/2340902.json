    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Municipality\"&gt;Municipalities&lt;/a&gt; (, &lt;a href=\"grammatical%20number\"&gt;singular&lt;/a&gt; ) are the lowest level of official territorial division in &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. This can be the second, third, fourth or fifth level of territorial division, depending on the status of the municipality and the \"&lt;a href=\"States%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Land&lt;/a&gt;\" (federal state) it is part of. The city-states Berlin and Hamburg are second-level divisions. A \"Gemeinde\" is one level lower in those &lt;a href=\"States%20of%20Germany\"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; which also include \"&lt;a href=\"Regierungsbezirk\"&gt;Regierungsbezirk&lt;/a&gt;e\" (singular: \"Regierungsbezirk\") as an intermediate territorial division (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia). The \"Gemeinde\" is one level higher if it is not part of a \"&lt;a href=\"Gemeindeverband\"&gt;Gemeindeverband&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"municipal association\"). \nThe highest degree of autonomy may be found in the \"Gemeinden\" which are not part of a \"&lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Kreis&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"district\"). These \"Gemeinden\" are referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Kreisfreie_Stadt\"&gt;Kreisfreie St\u00e4dte&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Stadtkreis\"&gt;Stadtkreise&lt;/a&gt;\", often translated as \"urban district\". In some states they retained a higher measure of autonomy than the other municipalities of the \"Kreis\" (e.g. \"Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt\"). Municipalities titled \"Stadt\" (town or city) are urban municipalities while those titled \"Gemeinde\" are classified as rural municipalities.\nWith more than 3,600,000 inhabitants, the most populous municipality of Germany is the city of &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;; and the least populous is &lt;a href=\"Gr%C3%B6de\"&gt;Gr\u00f6de&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Schleswig-Holstein\"&gt;Schleswig-Holstein&lt;/a&gt;.\nMunicipalities per federal state.\n\"Status as of December 2018.\"\nMunicipal reforms.\nThe number of municipalities of Germany has decreased strongly over the years: in 1968 there were 24,282 municipalities in &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1980 there were 8,409. The same trend occurred in the &lt;a href=\"New%20states%20of%20Germany\"&gt;New states of Germany&lt;/a&gt; after the German reunification: from 7,612 municipalities in 1990 to 2,627 at the end of 2018. While in some cases growing cities absorbed neighbouring municipalities, most of these mergers were driven by a need to increase the efficiency and reduce costs of administration. At the same time, many districts and also urban districts were merged into larger districts.\nTypes of municipalities.\nThere are several types of municipalities in Germany, with different levels of autonomy. Each federal state has its own administrative laws, and its own local government structure. The main types of municipalities are:\nLocal elections.\nIn all municipalities, the &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; and the members of the &lt;a href=\"municipal%20council\"&gt;municipal council&lt;/a&gt; are appointed by &lt;a href=\"local%20election\"&gt;local election&lt;/a&gt;s that take place on a regular basis. Elections for the municipal councils () take place every 4 years in Bremen, every 6 years in Bavaria and every 5 years in all other states. \nThe office of mayor is full-time () in larger municipalities, and voluntary () in smaller municipalities, for instance those that are part of a municipal association. Mayors are elected for a specific term, which is different in every state. Since mayoral elections also have to be held when a mayor resigns from office, these do not take place at the same time for all municipalities in a state. The terms for mayors are:"
