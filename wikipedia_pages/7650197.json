In 2016, Zaytuna College became the first accredited Muslim campus in the United States after it received approval from the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Association%20of%20Schools%20and%20Colleges\"&gt;Western Association of Schools and Colleges&lt;/a&gt;.\nViews.\nAs reported in &lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, Zaid Shakir appeared with nine other influential Muslim scholars in a YouTube video denouncing militant Islam. The aftermath of 911 Shakir states, \"People all over the world have felt the repercussions and the reprisals for the senseless brutality of 9/11's perpetrators. Our best hope is to attempt to move beyond the pain, strife and hatred unleashed. Trusting in the power and promise of God we will be able to do just that.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chronicle%20of%20Higher%20Education\"&gt;Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/a&gt; has praised him, stating, \"Embodying an American story if ever there was one\u2014including proverbial bootstraps, military service, political activism, and deep religious commitment\u2014Zaid Shakir's message of social justice in the face of poverty and racism he has known first hand makes him endlessly and, it often seems, effortlessly relevant. He is as approachable a man as I've ever met.\"&lt;ref name=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-american-islam/sexual-identity-marriage-and-family/C505ED04927387BD5A99AD88D4CA4707 pp. 312-329\"&gt;\"The Cambridge Companion to American Islam / Sexual Identity, Marriage, and Family\", &lt;/ref&gt;\nShakir states in \"Scapegoats: How Islamophobia Helps Our Enemies &amp; Threatens Our Freedoms\", \"Sharia forbids members of a Muslim minority [in Western societies] from engaging in clandestine acts of violence and paramilitary organizing... or from acting as political or military agents for a Muslim-majority country. Islamic law also forbids the disruption of public safety, many of the practices that the average person fearfully associates with some Muslims today, like killing innocent people (non-Muslims and Muslims alike) and stoning women.\"\nReception.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20500%20Most%20Influential%20Muslims\"&gt;The 500 Most Influential Muslims&lt;/a&gt; of the world edition 2020 describes Zaid Shakir as \"an influential Islamic scholar and a voice of conscience for American Muslims and non-Muslims alike.\", edited by &lt;a href=\"John%20Esposito\"&gt;John Esposito&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20Kalin\"&gt;Ibrahim Kalin&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; - The Magazine's June 12 World Fame Issue,\"The Greatest, At Rest\". Imam Zaid Shakir spoke the last words Ali heard on his deathbed. He leans over and with his mouth close to Ali's right ear, he sings, \"There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.\" Shakir begins talking to Ali, entreating him, exhorting him, telling him, \"Muhammad Ali, this is what it means, God is one; say it, repeat it, you've inspired so many, paradise is waiting -- \". He was, in Shakir's description, \"a praying man\" who understood he belonged to Allah. But he also knew he was Muhammad Ali, and so belonged to the world\".\n&lt;a href=\"Tikkun%20Daily\"&gt;Tikkun Daily&lt;/a&gt; states that he is \"one of the most thoughtful and dynamic teachers about the true nature of Islam in America today\".\nZaid Shakir was named in &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;'s 2018 list of \"25 Influential American Muslims\", where he was described as \"one of the West's most respected Muslim scholars."
