    "text": "Harry Morgan Gowdy (August 24, 1889 \u2013 August 1, 1966) was an American &lt;a href=\"Professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"catcher\"&gt;catcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coach%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt; who played in the &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;major leagues&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Braves%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Boston Braves&lt;/a&gt;. He was a member of the .\nHe was the first active major league player to enlist for service in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, and the only player to fight in both World War I and &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nGowdy was born in Columbus, Ohio. He graduated from &lt;a href=\"Columbus%20International%20High%20School\"&gt;Columbus North High School&lt;/a&gt; in 1908.\nHe and his wife Pauline had no children.\nA nephew, Pat Bonaventura, is completing a book about Gowdy's life.\nMajor League career.\nGowdy made his major league debut with &lt;a href=\"John%20McGraw\"&gt;John McGraw&lt;/a&gt;'s New York Giants in &lt;a href=\"1910%20New%20York%20Giants%20season\"&gt;1910&lt;/a&gt;, before being traded to Boston the next year. He did not see much playing time and spent the majority of the &lt;a href=\"1913%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1913 season&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Bisons\"&gt;Buffalo Bisons&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"International%20League\"&gt;International League&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1914%20Boston%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1914&lt;/a&gt;, Gowdy became the Braves regular catcher in a year that saw them go from last place to first in two months, becoming the first team to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. In the &lt;a href=\"1914%20World%20Series\"&gt;1914 World Series&lt;/a&gt;, he had a .545 &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt;, including the only &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt; of the series, in the historic upset of &lt;a href=\"Connie%20Mack\"&gt;Connie Mack's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1914%20Philadelphia%20Athletics%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Athletics&lt;/a&gt;. Gowdy had 50,000 fans celebrate him in a parade in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio that October.\nGowdy saw more playing time in subsequent seasons, but when World War I broke out, he became the first major league player to enlist. He saw considerable action in France with the 166th Infantry Regiment of the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20National%20Guard\"&gt;Ohio National Guard&lt;/a&gt;, including some of the worst trench fighting in the war. When he returned in , he got his old job as catcher back, but not before going on a speaking tour of the United States, detailing his war experiences. Four years later, he was traded back to the Giants, where he played in the &lt;a href=\"1923%20World%20Series\"&gt;1923&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1924%20World%20Series\"&gt;1924 World Series&lt;/a&gt;, but his heroics weren't repeated, as he committed a costly error which led to the game-winning run in Game 7 of the 1924 series against the &lt;a href=\"1924%20Washington%20Senators%20season\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt;. In , the Giants released him. Four years later, he made a comeback with the Braves, albeit with very limited playing time. He then became a coach with the Giants, Braves, and the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Reds\"&gt;Reds&lt;/a&gt;. Later he left his coaching job to serve as an Army captain in World War II at the age of 53 and is believed to be the only big league baseball player to serve in both world wars.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a seventeen-year major league career, Gowdy played in 1,050 &lt;a href=\"Games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;, accumulating 738 &lt;a href=\"Hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; in 2,735 &lt;a href=\"at%20bats\"&gt;at bats&lt;/a&gt; for a .270 career batting average along with 21 &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s and 322 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt;. He ended his career with a .975 &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt;. Gowdy twice led the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"caught%20stealing\"&gt;caught stealing&lt;/a&gt; percentage. His 52.58% career caught stealing percentage ranks him sixth in major league history. Gowdy's reputation as a defensive stand out is enhanced because of the era in which he played. In the &lt;a href=\"Deadball%20Era\"&gt;Deadball Era&lt;/a&gt;, catchers played a huge defensive role, given the large number of &lt;a href=\"Bunt%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;bunt&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stolen%20base\"&gt;stolen base&lt;/a&gt; attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the &lt;a href=\"spitball\"&gt;spitball&lt;/a&gt; pitchers who dominated pitching staffs.\nCoaching career.\nWhen the United States entered World War II, Gowdy enlisted again at the age of 53, and was promoted to major. In December 1944, he returned to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Benning\"&gt;Fort Benning&lt;/a&gt;, where he served as Chief Athletic Officer. The baseball field at Fort Benning bears his name. He returned to coaching in with the Reds, and he even served as manager for four games at the end of the season. By 1948, he had retired from baseball.\nUnsuccessful Hall of Fame bid.\nGowdy has the record for most unsuccessful Hall of Fame induction attempts, without ever having been enshrined in the Hall. While current custom limits the times a player can appear on the ballot to 10, Gowdy received votes 17 years, never being elected to the Hall of Fame (&lt;a href=\"Edd%20Roush\"&gt;Edd Roush&lt;/a&gt; has the record for most Hall attempts with 19, but he was later enshrined by the Veteran's Committee).\nGowdy died at his home in &lt;a href=\"Columbus%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Columbus, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; at age 76. &lt;a href=\"Gowdy%20Field\"&gt;Gowdy Field&lt;/a&gt; in Columbus is named in his honor."
