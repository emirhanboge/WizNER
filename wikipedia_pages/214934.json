    "text": "Stonemasonry or stonecraft is the creation of &lt;a href=\"building\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;s, structures, and &lt;a href=\"sculpture\"&gt;sculpture&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"rock%20%28geology%29\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; as the primary material. It is one of the oldest activities and professions in human history. Many of the long-lasting, ancient &lt;a href=\"Shelter%20%28building%29\"&gt;shelter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"monument\"&gt;monument&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"artifact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fortification\"&gt;fortification&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"road\"&gt;road&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bridge\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt;s, and entire &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; were built of stone. Famous works of stonemasonry include the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20pyramids\"&gt;Egyptian pyramids&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Taj%20Mahal\"&gt;Taj Mahal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cusco\"&gt;Cusco's Incan Wall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Island\"&gt;Easter Island&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Moai\"&gt;statues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angkor%20Wat\"&gt;Angkor Wat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Borobudur\"&gt;Borobudur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tihuanaco\"&gt;Tihuanaco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenochtitlan\"&gt;Tenochtitlan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Persepolis\"&gt;Persepolis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Parthenon\"&gt;Parthenon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonehenge\"&gt;Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wall%20of%20China\"&gt;Great Wall of China&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chartres%20Cathedral\"&gt;Chartres Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefinition.\nMasonry is the craft of shaping rough pieces of rock into accurate geometrical shapes, at times simple, but some of considerable complexity, and then arranging the resulting stones, often together with &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20%28masonry%29\"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt;, to form structures.\nThe basic tools, methods and skills of the banker mason have existed as a trade for thousands of years.\nThe modern stonemason undergoes comprehensive training, both in the classroom and in the working environment. Hands-on skill is complemented by an intimate knowledge of each stone type, its application, and best uses, and how to work and fix each stone in place. The mason may be skilled and competent to carry out one or all of the various branches of stonemasonry. In some areas, the trend is towards specialization, in other areas towards adaptability.\nTypes of stone.\nStonemasons use all types of natural stone: &lt;a href=\"igneous\"&gt;igneous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"metamorphic\"&gt;metamorphic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sedimentary\"&gt;sedimentary&lt;/a&gt;; while some also use &lt;a href=\"artificial%20stone\"&gt;artificial stone&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nSedimentary.\nMany of the world's most famous buildings have been built of sedimentary stone, from &lt;a href=\"Durham%20Cathedral\"&gt;Durham Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica\"&gt;St Peter's&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;. There are two main types of sedimentary stone used in masonry work, &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;s. Examples of limestones include &lt;a href=\"Bath%20stone\"&gt;Bath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Portland%20stone\"&gt;Portland stone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Yorkstone\"&gt;Yorkstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20sandstone\"&gt;Sydney sandstone&lt;/a&gt; are the most commonly used sandstone.\nTypes.\nTypes of stonemasonry are:\nToday's stonemasons undergo training that is quite comprehensive and is done both in the work environment and in the classroom. It isn't enough to have hands-on skill anymore. One must also have knowledge of the types of stones as well as its best uses and how to work it as well as how to fix it in place.\nTraining.\nTraditionally medieval stonemasons served a seven-year &lt;a href=\"apprenticeship\"&gt;apprenticeship&lt;/a&gt;. A similar system still operates today.\nA modern apprenticeship lasts three years. This combines on-site learning through personal experience, the experience of the tradesmen, and college work where apprentices are given an overall experience of the building, hewing and theory work involved in masonry. In some areas, colleges offer courses which teach not only the manual skills but also related fields such as drafting and blueprint reading or construction conservation. Electronic Stonemasonry training resources enhance traditional delivery techniques. Hands-on workshops are a good way to learn about stonemasonry also. Those wishing to become stonemasons should have little problem working at heights, possess reasonable hand-eye coordination, be moderately physically fit, and have basic mathematical ability. Most of these things can be developed while learning.\nTools.\nStonemasons use a wide variety of &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s to handle and shape stone blocks (&lt;a href=\"ashlar\"&gt;ashlar&lt;/a&gt;) and slabs into finished articles. The basic tools for shaping the stone are a &lt;a href=\"mallet\"&gt;mallet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chisel\"&gt;chisel&lt;/a&gt;s, and a metal &lt;a href=\"Straightedge\"&gt;straight edge&lt;/a&gt;. With these one can make a flat surface \u2013 the basis of all stonemasonry.\nChisels come in a variety of sizes and shapes, dependent upon the function for which they are being used and have many different names depending on locality. There are different chisels for different materials and sizes of material being worked, for removing large amounts of material and for putting a fine finish on the stone.\nMixing mortar is normally done today with mortar mixers which usually use a rotating drum or rotating paddles to mix the mortar.\nThe &lt;a href=\"masonry%20trowel\"&gt;masonry trowel&lt;/a&gt; is used for the application of the mortar between and around the stones as they are set into place. Filling in the gaps (joints) with mortar is referred to as pointing. Pointing in smaller joints can be accomplished using &lt;a href=\"tuck%20pointer\"&gt;tuck pointer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pointing%20trowel\"&gt;pointing trowel&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"margin%20trowel\"&gt;margin trowel&lt;/a&gt;s, among other tools.\nA mason's hammer has a long thin head and is called a Punch Hammer. It would be used with a chisel or splitter for a variety of purposes\nA walling hammer (catchy hammer) can be used in place of a hammer and chisel or pincher to produce rubble or pinnings or snecks.\nStonemasons use a &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20%28lifting%20appliance%29\"&gt;lewis&lt;/a&gt; together with a &lt;a href=\"Crane%20%28machine%29\"&gt;crane&lt;/a&gt; or block and tackle to hoist building stones into place.\nToday power tools such as compressed-air chisels, abrasive spinners, and &lt;a href=\"angle%20grinder\"&gt;angle grinder&lt;/a&gt;s are much used: these save time and money, but are hazardous and require just as much skill as the hand tools that they augment. But many of the basic tools of stonemasonry have remained virtually the same throughout vast amounts of time, even thousands of years, for instance when comparing chisels that can be bought today with chisels found at the pyramids of Giza the common sizes and shapes are virtually unchanged.\nStonemasonry is one of the earliest trades in &lt;a href=\"civilization\"&gt;civilization&lt;/a&gt;'s history. During the time of the &lt;a href=\"Neolithic%20Revolution\"&gt;Neolithic Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Domestication\"&gt;domestication of animals&lt;/a&gt;, people learned how to use fire to create &lt;a href=\"Calcium%20oxide\"&gt;quicklime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plaster\"&gt;plaster&lt;/a&gt;s, and mortars. They used these to fashion homes for themselves with mud, straw, or stone, and masonry was born.\nThe Ancients heavily relied on the stonemason to build the most impressive and long-lasting monuments to their civilizations. The &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;Egyptians&lt;/a&gt; built their &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20pyramids\"&gt;pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s, the civilizations of Central America had their &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20pyramid\"&gt;step pyramids&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Achaemenid%20Empire\"&gt;Persians&lt;/a&gt; their palaces, the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Greeks&lt;/a&gt; their temples, and the Romans their public works and wonders (See &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Architecture\"&gt;Roman Architecture&lt;/a&gt;). People of the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20Valley%20Civilization\"&gt;Indus Valley Civilization&lt;/a&gt;, such as at &lt;a href=\"Dholavira\"&gt;Dholavira&lt;/a&gt; made entire cities characterized by stone architecture. Among the famous ancient stonemasons is &lt;a href=\"Sophroniscus\"&gt;Sophroniscus&lt;/a&gt;, the father of &lt;a href=\"Socrates\"&gt;Socrates&lt;/a&gt;, who was a stone-cutter.\nCastle building was an entire industry for the medieval stonemasons. When the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Western Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; fell, building in dressed stone decreased in much of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Europe\"&gt;Western Europe&lt;/a&gt;, and there was a resulting increase in timber-based construction. Stonework experienced a resurgence in the 9th and 10th centuries in Europe, and by the 12th-century religious fervour resulted in the construction of thousands of impressive churches and cathedrals in stone across Western Europe.\nMedieval stonemasons' skills were in high demand, and members of the &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;, gave rise to three classes of stonemasons: &lt;a href=\"apprentice\"&gt;apprentice&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"journeyman\"&gt;journeymen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Architect\"&gt;master masons&lt;/a&gt;. Apprentices were indentured to their masters as the price for their training, journeymen were qualified craftsmen who were paid by the day, and master masons were considered freemen who could travel as they wished to work on the projects of the &lt;a href=\"patron\"&gt;patron&lt;/a&gt;s and could operate as self-employed craftsmen and train apprentices. During the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, the stonemason's guild admitted members who were not stonemasons, and eventually evolved into the Society of &lt;a href=\"Freemasonry\"&gt;Freemasonry&lt;/a&gt;; fraternal groups which observe the traditional culture of stonemasons but are not typically involved in modern construction projects.\nA medieval stonemason would often carve a &lt;a href=\"Mason%27s%20mark\"&gt;personal symbol&lt;/a&gt; onto their block to differentiate their work from that of other stonemasons. This also provided a simple \u2018quality assurance\u2019 system.\nThe Renaissance saw stonemasonry return to the prominence and sophistication of the &lt;a href=\"Classical%20antiquity\"&gt;Classical age&lt;/a&gt;. The rise of the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20humanism\"&gt;humanist philosophy&lt;/a&gt; gave people the ambition to create marvelous works of art. The centre stage for the Renaissance would prove to be Italy, where &lt;a href=\"Italian%20city-states\"&gt;Italian city-states&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt; erected great structures, including the &lt;a href=\"Florence%20Cathedral\"&gt;Florence Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fountain%20of%20Neptune%2C%20Florence\"&gt;Fountain of Neptune&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Laurentian%20Library\"&gt;Laurentian Library&lt;/a&gt;, which was planned and built by &lt;a href=\"Michelangelo%20Buonarroti\"&gt;Michelangelo Buonarroti&lt;/a&gt;, a famous sculptor of the Renaissance.\nWhen Europeans settled the Americas, they brought the stonemasonry techniques of their respective homelands with them. Settlers used what materials were available, and in some areas, stone was the material of choice. In the first waves, building mimicked that of Europe, to eventually be replaced by unique architecture later on.\nIn the 20th century, stonemasonry saw its most radical changes in the way the work is accomplished. Prior to the first half of the century, most heavy work was executed by &lt;a href=\"Draft%20horse\"&gt;draft animals&lt;/a&gt; or human muscle power. With the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"internal%20combustion%20engine\"&gt;internal combustion engine&lt;/a&gt;, many of these hard aspects of the trade have been made simpler and easier. Cranes and &lt;a href=\"Forklift%20truck\"&gt;forklifts&lt;/a&gt; have made moving and laying heavy stones relatively easy for the stonemasons. Motor powered mortar mixers have saved much in time and energy as well. &lt;a href=\"Pneumatics\"&gt;Compressed-air&lt;/a&gt; powered tools have made working of stone less time-intensive. &lt;a href=\"Petrol\"&gt;Petrol&lt;/a&gt; and electric-powered &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20tool\"&gt;abrasive saws&lt;/a&gt; can cut through stone much faster and with more precision than chiseling alone. &lt;a href=\"Cementite\"&gt;Carbide&lt;/a&gt;-tipped chisels can stand up to much more abuse than the steel and iron chisels made by &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;s of old.\nSee also.\nCategories:"
