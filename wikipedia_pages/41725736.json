    "text": "The 2014 Super League Grand Final was the 17th official Grand Final and conclusive and deciding match of &lt;a href=\"Super%20League%20XIX\"&gt;Super League XIX&lt;/a&gt;. It was held on Saturday 11 October 2014, at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford%20%28football%20ground%29\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;, Manchester with a 6pm kick-off time. The game was played between the top two teams from the regular season, &lt;a href=\"2014%20St%20Helens%20RLFC%20season\"&gt;St Helens RLFC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Warriors\"&gt;Wigan Warriors&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe 2014 &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt; season (known as the First Utility &lt;a href=\"Super%20League%20XIX\"&gt;Super League XIX&lt;/a&gt; due to sponsorship by &lt;a href=\"First%20Utility\"&gt;First Utility&lt;/a&gt;) was the 19th season of &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; football since the &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt; format was introduced in 1996. Fourteen teams competed for the &lt;a href=\"League%20Leaders%27%20Shield\"&gt;League Leaders' Shield&lt;/a&gt; over 27 rounds (including the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Weekend\"&gt;Magic Weekend&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester), after which the highest finishing teams will enter the play-offs to compete for a place in the Grand Final and a chance to win the championship and the Super League Trophy.\nMatch details.\n Following a fiery opening that started with the kind of big tackles that this derby game has become known for, the game suffered a dramatic twist in only the second minute of the game when Wigan Prop, &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Flower\"&gt;Ben Flower&lt;/a&gt;, became the first and only player to be sent off in a grand final by referee &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Bentham\"&gt;Phil Bentham&lt;/a&gt; after he punched &lt;a href=\"Lance%20Hohaia\"&gt;Lance Hohaia&lt;/a&gt; in the face, thus knocking him out, then as he lay defenceless on the floor, he punched him in the face again. \nThis forced &lt;a href=\"Wigan%20Warriors\"&gt;Wigan&lt;/a&gt; to play 78 minutes with 12-men, causing a switch in the Wigan approach to one of smash-and-grab. A valiant first-half performance by Wigan's 12-men meant they entered the break with a 6\u20132 lead.\nDespite further strong defensive displays by the Wigan outfit in the ensuing second-half, &lt;a href=\"Iosia%20Soliola\"&gt;Iosia Soliola&lt;/a&gt; forced himself over the Wigan try-line in his final appearance in the Red-Vee to put &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20R.F.C.\"&gt;St. Helens&lt;/a&gt; ahead, and in control of the game. An admirable, yet desperate display by Wigan, to get themselves back into contention was halted, when &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Makinson\"&gt;Tommy Makinson&lt;/a&gt; crashed over for Saints, 12 minutes from time to make the score 14\u20136, after a precise kick over-the-top of the Wigan defence from Saints stalwart, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Wellens\"&gt;Paul Wellens&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a late Wigan flurry, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Makinson\"&gt;Makinson's&lt;/a&gt; try proved to be the one that sealed the game and the championship for &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20R.F.C.\"&gt;St. Helens&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that the Saints claimed their first championship title since 2006, and their sixth overall in the Super League era (St Helens are now equal with &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds Rhinos&lt;/a&gt; for titles since 1996, both have 6 titles).\nWorld Club Series.\nBy winning this match the Saints had qualified for the &lt;a href=\"World%20Club%20Challenge\"&gt;World Club Series&lt;/a&gt; Final, to be played early in the 2015 season against the winners of the &lt;a href=\"2014%20NRL%20Grand%20final\"&gt;2014 NRL Grand final&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"South%20Sydney%20Rabbitohs\"&gt;South Sydney Rabbitohs&lt;/a&gt;."
