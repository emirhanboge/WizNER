    "text": "Matthew Robert Smith (born 28 October 1982) is an English actor. He is best known for his roles as the &lt;a href=\"Eleventh%20Doctor\"&gt;eleventh incarnation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20Doctor%20%28Doctor%20Who%29\"&gt;the Doctor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; series \"&lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Who\"&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Prince Philip&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Netflix\"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; series \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crown%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt;\", the latter of which earned him a &lt;a href=\"Primetime%20Emmy%20Award\"&gt;Primetime Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt; nomination.\nSmith initially aspired to be a professional &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"spondylolysis\"&gt;spondylolysis&lt;/a&gt; forced him out of the sport. After joining the &lt;a href=\"National%20Youth%20Theatre\"&gt;National Youth Theatre&lt;/a&gt; and studying drama and creative writing at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20East%20Anglia\"&gt;University of East Anglia&lt;/a&gt;, he became an actor in 2003, performing in plays including \"&lt;a href=\"Murder%20in%20the%20Cathedral\"&gt;Murder in the Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Fresh Kills\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20History%20Boys\"&gt;The History Boys&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Shore%20of%20the%20Wide%20World\"&gt;On the Shore of the Wide World&lt;/a&gt;\" in London theatres. Extending his repertoire into &lt;a href=\"West%20End%20theatre\"&gt;West End&lt;/a&gt; theatre, he has since performed in the stage adaptation of \"&lt;a href=\"Swimming%20with%20Sharks%23In%20other%20popular%20culture\"&gt;Swimming with Sharks&lt;/a&gt;\" with &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Slater\"&gt;Christian Slater&lt;/a&gt;, followed a year later by a critically acclaimed performance as Henry in \"&lt;a href=\"That%20Face\"&gt;That Face&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSmith's first television role came in 2006 as &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Lockhart%23Jim%20Taylor\"&gt;Jim Taylor&lt;/a&gt; in the BBC adaptations of &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Pullman\"&gt;Philip Pullman&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ruby%20in%20the%20Smoke%23TV%20adaptation\"&gt;The Ruby in the Smoke&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%20in%20the%20North%23TV%20adaptation\"&gt;The Shadow in the North&lt;/a&gt;\", while his first major role in television came as Danny in the 2007 BBC series \"&lt;a href=\"Party%20Animals%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Party Animals&lt;/a&gt;\". Smith portrayed the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor in \"Doctor Who\" from 2010 to 2013, becoming the youngest person to portray the character. In film, he starred in \"&lt;a href=\"Womb%20%28film%29\"&gt;Womb&lt;/a&gt;\" (2010) and portrayed the physical embodiment of &lt;a href=\"Skynet%20%28Terminator%29\"&gt;Skynet&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Terminator%20Genisys\"&gt;Terminator Genisys&lt;/a&gt;\" (2015).\nEarly life.\nMatthew Robert Smith was born in &lt;a href=\"Northampton\"&gt;Northampton&lt;/a&gt; on 28 October 1982, the son of Lynne and David Smith. He has a sister named Laura Jayne, who was one of the dancers featured in the well-known music video for &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Prydz\"&gt;Eric Prydz&lt;/a&gt;'s 2004 song \"&lt;a href=\"Call%20on%20Me%20%28Eric%20Prydz%20song%29\"&gt;Call on Me&lt;/a&gt;\". Smith attended &lt;a href=\"Northampton%20School%20for%20Boys\"&gt;Northampton School for Boys&lt;/a&gt;. His grandfather had played &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Notts%20County%20FC\"&gt;Notts County&lt;/a&gt; and Smith had also planned to play football, having played for the youth teams of &lt;a href=\"Northampton%20Town%20FC\"&gt;Northampton Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20Forest%20FC\"&gt;Nottingham Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City%20FC\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt;, becoming captain of the latter's youth team. A serious back injury resulted in &lt;a href=\"spondylolysis\"&gt;spondylolysis&lt;/a&gt;, and he was unable to continue with a footballing career.\nSmith's drama teacher introduced him to acting by signing him up for theatrical productions without his consent. After failing to participate on the first two occasions, his teacher arranged for him to play the tenth juror in an adaptation of \"&lt;a href=\"Twelve%20Angry%20Men%20%28play%29\"&gt;Twelve Angry Men&lt;/a&gt;\". Although he took part, he refused to attend a drama festival for which his teacher had also signed him up, as he saw himself as a football player and believed acting would damage his social life. His drama teacher persisted, eventually persuading him to join the &lt;a href=\"National%20Youth%20Theatre\"&gt;National Youth Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. After leaving school, Smith studied Drama and Creative Writing at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20East%20Anglia\"&gt;University of East Anglia&lt;/a&gt;, graduating in 2005. With the National Youth Theatre, he played &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Becket\"&gt;Thomas Becket&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Murder%20in%20the%20Cathedral\"&gt;Murder in the Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;\" and Bassoon in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Master%20and%20Margarita%23Adaptations\"&gt;The Master and Margarita&lt;/a&gt;\". His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs, \"Fresh Kills\" and \"&lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Shore%20of%20the%20Wide%20World\"&gt;On the Shore of the Wide World&lt;/a&gt;\", which led him to seek an agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year.\nCareer.\nTelevision.\nEarly work.\nSmith's first television role was as Jim Taylor in the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; adaptations of the \"&lt;a href=\"Sally%20Lockhart\"&gt;Sally Lockhart&lt;/a&gt;\" quartet books \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ruby%20in%20the%20Smoke\"&gt;The Ruby in the Smoke&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%20in%20the%20North\"&gt;The Shadow in the North&lt;/a&gt;\". His first major television role came in the television series \"&lt;a href=\"Party%20Animals%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Party Animals&lt;/a&gt;\", a BBC drama series about fictional &lt;a href=\"Her%20Majesty%27s%20Government\"&gt;parliamentary advisors and researchers&lt;/a&gt;. Smith portrayed Danny Foster, a parliamentary researcher who was described as an intelligent but timid \"politics geek\" who should have moved on from researching at his age. In an interview in 2007, Smith summarised the character as having a romantic outlook of the political world while being cynical elsewhere. He talked about his character's emotional and intellectual maturity; emotionally, he lacks confidence around women, though Smith portrays him as a caring and sensitive but \"wry, sarcastic, [and] witty\" romantic. Intellectually, Danny is portrayed as attentive and possessing a strong work ethic.\nSmith auditioned for the role of &lt;a href=\"Will%20McKenzie\"&gt;Will McKenzie&lt;/a&gt; in the comedy series \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Inbetweeners\"&gt;The Inbetweeners&lt;/a&gt;\", with the part eventually being given to actor &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Bird\"&gt;Simon Bird&lt;/a&gt;. This was revealed in an interview in 2009 by the show's writer &lt;a href=\"Iain%20Morris\"&gt;Iain Morris&lt;/a&gt;, who said, \"We auditioned literally 1,000 people... he was brilliant\u2014down to the last two for Will, I think. I think he was a bit too dashing!\"\n\"Doctor Who\".\nSmith was revealed as the &lt;a href=\"Eleventh%20Doctor\"&gt;Eleventh Doctor&lt;/a&gt; in the British science-fiction television series \"&lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Who\"&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt;\" in January 2009 to replace &lt;a href=\"David%20Tennant\"&gt;David Tennant&lt;/a&gt;, who announced his departure in October 2008. Smith was a relatively unknown actor compared to the actors then speculated about possibly taking on the role, who included &lt;a href=\"Paterson%20Joseph\"&gt;Paterson Joseph&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20Morrissey\"&gt;David Morrissey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Pertwee\"&gt;Sean Pertwee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20Nesbitt\"&gt;James Nesbitt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Tovey\"&gt;Russell Tovey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20Zeta-Jones\"&gt;Catherine Zeta-Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chiwetel%20Ejiofor\"&gt;Chiwetel Ejiofor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Carlyle\"&gt;Robert Carlyle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Billie%20Piper\"&gt;Billie Piper&lt;/a&gt;. Smith was first named as a possible successor less than a day before he was announced as the Eleventh Doctor, on edition of 3 January 2009 of \"&lt;a href=\"BBC%20Breakfast\"&gt;BBC Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;\", among the names speculated about. His obscurity prompted the news headline \"Doctor Who?\", a riff on the show's title.\nSmith was one of the earliest actors to audition for the role, performing on the first day. The production team, consisting of incoming producer &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Moffat\"&gt;Steven Moffat&lt;/a&gt; and BBC Wales Head of Drama and executive producer &lt;a href=\"Piers%20Wenger\"&gt;Piers Wenger&lt;/a&gt;, immediately singled him out based on his performance. Smith additionally auditioned for the role of &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Watson\"&gt;John Watson&lt;/a&gt; in the Moffat-created \"&lt;a href=\"Sherlock%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Sherlock&lt;/a&gt;\", undergoing auditions at the same time; he was unsuccessful, as Moffat believed his eccentric acting style was closer to &lt;a href=\"Sherlock%20Holmes\"&gt;Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, a role that had already been given to &lt;a href=\"Benedict%20Cumberbatch\"&gt;Benedict Cumberbatch&lt;/a&gt;. At 26 years old, Smith was three years younger than &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Davison\"&gt;Peter Davison&lt;/a&gt; was at the time of his casting as the Doctor in 1981, making him the youngest Doctor and the youngest actor to be suggested for the role. After three weeks of auditions, Moffat and Wenger agreed that it had \"always been Matt\" and approached him to accept the role.\nSmith made his debut as &lt;a href=\"The%20Doctor%20%28Doctor%20Who%29\"&gt;the Doctor&lt;/a&gt; in the episode \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Eleventh%20Hour%20%28Doctor%20Who%29\"&gt;The Eleventh Hour&lt;/a&gt;\" in April 2010. The BBC were cautious about casting Smith because they felt that a 26-year-old could not play the Doctor adequately; Wenger shared the same sentiment but thought Smith had proven his acting quality in \"Party Animals\", which Wenger thought highlighted Smith's \"mercurial qualities\". Some fans of the show believed that Smith was inexperienced and too young for the role, while others supported him by citing his demonstrated acting ability. For his performance in his first series, he was nominated in the Outstanding Drama Performance Category of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Television%20Awards\"&gt;National Television Awards&lt;/a&gt;. Smith is the first actor in the role to garner a nomination for a &lt;a href=\"British%20Academy%20Television%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor\"&gt;British Academy Television Award for Best Actor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmith said of his character, \"The Doctor is excited and fascinated by the tiniest of things. By everything. By every single thing. That's what's wonderful about him as a character. It's why children like him, I think. Because he doesn't dismiss anything. He's not cynical. He's open to every single facet of the universe.\" In June 2010, Smith appeared on stage with &lt;a href=\"Orbital%20%28band%29\"&gt;Orbital&lt;/a&gt;, and performed with them a version of the &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Who%20theme%20music\"&gt;\"Doctor Who\" theme&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Glastonbury%20Festival%202010\"&gt;Glastonbury Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Smith hosted the &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Who%20Prom%20%282010%29\"&gt;\"Doctor Who\" Prom&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Albert%20Hall\"&gt;Royal Albert Hall&lt;/a&gt; on 24\u201325 July 2010. On the morning of 26 May 2012, Smith carried the &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20flame\"&gt;Olympic torch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cardiff\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;, an activity which was noted by \"Doctor Who\" fans for its resemblance to a &lt;a href=\"Fear%20Her\"&gt;2006 episode&lt;/a&gt; of the show in which the Doctor carried the torch. On 1 June 2013, the BBC announced that Smith would be leaving \"Doctor Who\" at the end of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Time%20of%20the%20Doctor\"&gt;2013 Christmas special&lt;/a&gt;. He was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Capaldi\"&gt;Peter Capaldi&lt;/a&gt;. Reflecting upon his decision to leave in a 2016 interview, he expressed regret for not staying longer, stating that he wanted to work longer with co-star &lt;a href=\"Jenna%20Coleman\"&gt;Jenna Coleman&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, while appearing on \"&lt;a href=\"Desert%20Island%20Discs\"&gt;Desert Island Discs&lt;/a&gt;\", he revealed that he nearly turned down the role of the Doctor.\nPost-\"Doctor Who\" work.\nIn June 2015, Smith was cast as &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh\"&gt;Prince Philip&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Netflix\"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; royal drama \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crown%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Crown&lt;/a&gt;\". He played the role for the series' first two seasons, garnering a nomination for the &lt;a href=\"Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Supporting%20Actor%20in%20a%20Drama%20Series\"&gt;Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.\nSmith will appear as &lt;a href=\"Daemon%20Targaryen\"&gt;Daemon Targaryen&lt;/a&gt; in the series \"&lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\", a prequel to the fantasy drama series \"&lt;a href=\"Game%20of%20Thrones\"&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn May 2021, Smith appeared in the music video for the song \"We're On Our Way Now\" by &lt;a href=\"Noel%20Gallagher%27s%20High%20Flying%20Birds\"&gt;Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds&lt;/a&gt;.\nFilm.\nSmith was cast in &lt;a href=\"Martin%20McDonagh\"&gt;Martin McDonagh&lt;/a&gt;'s black comedy crime \"&lt;a href=\"In%20Bruges\"&gt;In Bruges&lt;/a&gt;\" (2008), as the younger version of &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Fiennes\"&gt;Ralph Fiennes&lt;/a&gt;' character, but his scenes did not appear in the final cut of the film. He starred in the 2009 short film \"&lt;a href=\"Together%20%282009%20film%29\"&gt;Together&lt;/a&gt;\" and the 2010 film \"&lt;a href=\"Womb%20%28film%29\"&gt;Womb&lt;/a&gt;\". In February 2013, it was reported that Smith had signed up to appear in &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Gosling\"&gt;Ryan Gosling&lt;/a&gt;'s directorial debut \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20River%20%28film%29\"&gt;Lost River&lt;/a&gt;\". Smith's directorial debut, the short film \"Cargese\", was aired on &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Arts\"&gt;Sky Arts&lt;/a&gt; in May 2013. Smith had a supporting role as the embodiment of Skynet in \"&lt;a href=\"Terminator%20Genisys\"&gt;Terminator Genisys&lt;/a&gt;\" (2015); he was set to have more screen time in the sixth and seventh films in the &lt;a href=\"Terminator%20%28franchise%29\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;. On 20 November 2014, it was announced that Smith would star in the action-thriller film \"&lt;a href=\"Patient%20Zero%20%28film%29\"&gt;Patient Zero&lt;/a&gt;\". In January 2019, he joined Sony's &lt;a href=\"Spider-Man\"&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/a&gt; spin-off \"&lt;a href=\"Morbius%20%28film%29\"&gt;Morbius&lt;/a&gt;\".
