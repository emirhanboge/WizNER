    "text": "The First League of Herzeg-Bosnia served as the top &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; league in &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20Republic%20of%20Herzeg-Bosnia\"&gt;Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Bosnian%20War\"&gt;Bosnian War&lt;/a&gt; and post-war periods of the 1990s. During these years, football was divided along ethnic lines, with the &lt;a href=\"Croat\"&gt;Croat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosniaks\"&gt;Bosniak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serb\"&gt;Serb&lt;/a&gt; populations each running their own league. Because Bosniaks were the only group interested in a distinctly Bosnian-Herzegovinian league and &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;national team&lt;/a&gt;, only their league was recognized by the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe league formed in 1993. In the 1997/1998 season, the top Croat teams began facing the top Bosniak teams for entrance to &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; tournaments, something that had been denied the Herzeg-Bosnia league on its own. This setup lasted until the 2000/2001 season when the two leagues merged to form the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;."
