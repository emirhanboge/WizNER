    "text": "The tapaculos (pronounced /t\u00e6p\u0259\u02c8ku:l\u0259\u028a/) are a &lt;a href=\"Family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;, Rhinocryptidae, of small &lt;a href=\"suboscine\"&gt;suboscine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"passerine\"&gt;passerine&lt;/a&gt; birds, found mainly in &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt; and with the highest diversity in the &lt;a href=\"Andean\"&gt;Andean&lt;/a&gt; regions. Three species (&lt;a href=\"Choc%C3%B3%20tapaculo\"&gt;Choc\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tacarcuna%20tapaculo\"&gt;Tacarcuna&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"silvery-fronted%20tapaculo\"&gt;silvery-fronted&lt;/a&gt;) are found in southern &lt;a href=\"Central%20America\"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nTapaculos are small to medium-sized birds, with a total length ranging from 10\u201324\u00a0cm (4\u20139\u00bd\u00a0in). These are terrestrial species that fly only poorly on their short wings. They have strong legs, well-suited to their habitat of grassland or forest undergrowth. The tail is cocked and pointed towards the head, and the name \"tapaculo\" probably derives from &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; for loincloth (literally \"cover your behind\" --because it ought to). Another possible explanation is that it originates from the &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;an name for the &lt;a href=\"white-throated%20tapaculo\"&gt;white-throated tapaculo&lt;/a&gt;, simply \"tapaculo\", which is an &lt;a href=\"onomatopoeic\"&gt;onomatopoeic&lt;/a&gt; reference to its commonly heard song.\nWhile the majority of the family are small blackish or brown birds there are some larger and more colourful species. All tapaculos are skulking birds that frequently stay low in dense vegetation, even the larger, colorful species, and this renders them difficult to see. They are best located and \u2013 in the case of \"Scytalopus\" spp. \u2013 identified by their vocalisations.\nThey feed on insects, seeds and other soft plant material with their pointed &lt;a href=\"beak\"&gt;bills&lt;/a&gt;, and will scratch on the ground like a &lt;a href=\"pheasant\"&gt;pheasant&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost species lay two or three white &lt;a href=\"egg%20%28biology%29\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; in a covered location, whether it be a burrow, a hole in a tree, or a domed nest.\nStatus and conservation.\nSome species have highly localized distributions and, being poor fliers, they easily become isolated in small populations. &lt;a href=\"BirdLife%20International\"&gt;BirdLife International&lt;/a&gt; currently (2007) consider one species &lt;a href=\"Vulnerable%20species\"&gt;vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; (\"Scytalopus panamensis\"), three species &lt;a href=\"endangered\"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Scytalopus%20iraiensis\"&gt;\"S. iraiensis\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Scytalopus%20rodriguezi\"&gt;S. rodriguezi&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Scytalopus%20robbinsi\"&gt;S. robbinsi&lt;/a&gt;\"), and two species &lt;a href=\"critically%20endangered\"&gt;critically endangered&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bahia%20tapaculo\"&gt;\"Eleoscytalopus psychopompus\"&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Merulaxis%20stresemanni\"&gt;Merulaxis stresemanni&lt;/a&gt;\"). The two critically endangered species are restricted to &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20forest\"&gt;Atlantic forest&lt;/a&gt; of eastern Brazil, and were only recently rediscovered after several years without any records.\nSystematics.\nThe tapaculos were traditionally placed in a distinct &lt;a href=\"family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; Rhinocryptidae; more recent research (Irestedt \"et al.\" 2002, Rice 2005a,b) indicates that according to analysis of &lt;a href=\"mtDNA\"&gt;mt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nDNA\"&gt;nDNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"DNA%20sequence\"&gt;sequence&lt;/a&gt; data, the tapaculos might be better merged into the &lt;a href=\"Formicariidae\"&gt;Formicariidae&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"tribe%20%28biology%29\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; Rhinocryptini, as they are closer to the antthrushes than either is to the true &lt;a href=\"antpitta\"&gt;antpitta&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlternatively, the latter might be raised to family status. In this case, it would be possible to maintain the tapaculos as a separate family too, but it would seem altogether more warranted to consider them a &lt;a href=\"subfamily\"&gt;subfamily&lt;/a&gt; of the Formicariinae \"sensu stricto\", which would be called Rhinocryptinae.\nWhether this latter approach, the placement as a tribe in a tapaculo-antthrush Formicariinae subfamily, or maintenance as a separate family is to be preferred depends on whether the true antpittas are closer to the tapaculos and true antbirds, or rather to the \"&lt;a href=\"Pittasoma\"&gt;Pittasoma&lt;/a&gt;\" \"gnatthrushes\" and other gnateaters and the true &lt;a href=\"antbird\"&gt;antbird&lt;/a&gt;s. There are some, albeit very tentative, indications that the latter may indeed be the case, which would be reflected in the placement of the tapaculos as subfamily Rhinocryptinae, with the Formicariinae being restricted to the true antthrushes (Rice 2005a). Today, the tapaculos continue in the Rhinocryptidae until the systematics can be further defined.\nApparently not \"all\" tapaculo genera would have to be moved to the formicariids (Irestedt \"et al.\" 2002). As the &lt;a href=\"type%20genus\"&gt;type genus&lt;/a&gt; \"Rhinocrypta\" certainly would, any distinct genera (such as the peculiar &lt;a href=\"crescent-chest\"&gt;crescent-chest&lt;/a&gt;s) would need a new family name.\nAn alternative family name Pteroptochidae, has been used historically.\nTaxonomy of \"Scytalopus\".\nThe species-limits within the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Scytalopus\"&gt;Scytalopus&lt;/a&gt;\" is among the most complex matters in &lt;a href=\"Neotropical\"&gt;Neotropical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ornithology\"&gt;ornithology&lt;/a&gt;. They are highly &lt;a href=\"Crypsis\"&gt;cryptic&lt;/a&gt;, and identification using visual features often is impossible. Vocal and &lt;a href=\"biochemical\"&gt;biochemical&lt;/a&gt; data is typically needed to clarify the &lt;a href=\"Taxonomy%20%28biology%29\"&gt;taxonomic&lt;/a&gt; status of the various populations. Several &lt;a href=\"Bird%20species%20new%20to%20science%20described%20in%20the%202000s\"&gt;new species&lt;/a&gt; have been described in recent years (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Scytalopus%20whitneyi\"&gt;\"S. whitneyi\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scytalopus%20frankeae\"&gt;\"S. frankeae\"&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;). The Brazilian taxa are similarly complex with several recently described species and considerable confusion surrounding the use of the scientific name \"&lt;a href=\"Scytalopus%20speluncae\"&gt;Scytalopus speluncae&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAdditionally, still undescribed species are known to exist, while some species as currently defined actually may include several species (e.g. the southern population of the &lt;a href=\"large-footed%20tapaculo\"&gt;large-footed tapaculo&lt;/a&gt; may represent a yet undescribed species). The confusing situation is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that only ten species were recognized in this genus in 1970 (Krabbe &amp; Schulenberg, 2003), while the figure now is more than four times as high.\nSpecies list.\nFor a complete list of the tapaculos recognized by the International Ornithological Congress, see the article \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20tapaculo%20species\"&gt;List of tapaculo species&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGenera allied with antthrushes\nPlacement unresolved"
