    "text": "\"Hail to Old O.S.U.\" is the song from which the &lt;a href=\"fight%20song\"&gt;fight song&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20State%20University\"&gt;Oregon State University&lt;/a&gt; is based. It was written by Harold A. Wilkins in 1914 and is played mainly at sporting events like &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; games. The lyrics have been slightly altered since being written \"to conform to a changing culture\", changing to conform to new initials (O.A.C. became O.S.C., and later, O.S.U.), and the use of a more gender-neutral version.\nThe music and lyrics were copyrighted in 1914 and are now public domain.\nThe original lyrics (including original title, subheading, and punctuation).\nThe Fight Song.\nOregon State's Fight Song is a modified version of \"Hail to Old O.S.U.\" It consists of the chorus, a chant (O-S-U Fight B-E-A-V-E-R-S) backed by drums, and a repeat of the second half of the chorus. No verse is sung. The Oregon State University Alumni Association, owners of all rights to the song, modified the Fight Song lyrics in the 1980s to be gender neutral.\nThe current arrangement of \"Hail to Old OSU\" played by the &lt;a href=\"Oregon%20State%20University%20Marching%20Band\"&gt;Oregon State University Marching Band&lt;/a&gt; consists of the first verse, followed by the modified Fight Song. The second verse is no longer present in any modern arrangement of the song.\nHail to old OSU - Fight Song Lyrics.\nOSU, our hats are off to you\nBeavers, Beavers, fighters through and through\nWe'll root for every man, we'll cheer for every stand\nThat's made for old OSU.\nWatch our team go tearing down the field\nMen of iron, their strength will never yield.\nHail, hail, hail, hail\nHail to old OSU."
