    "text": "These congregations are affiliated with one of the five associations comprising the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.heartlanducc.org\"&gt;Heartland Conference&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Church%20of%20Christ\"&gt;United Church of Christ&lt;/a&gt;. They are listed in order of &lt;a href=\"Associations%20of%20the%20United%20Church%20of%20Christ\"&gt;association&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegend:&lt;BR&gt;(CC)--prior to 1957, congregation was member of the &lt;a href=\"Congregational%20Christian%20Churches\"&gt;Congregational Christian Churches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;(E&amp;R)--prior to 1957, congregation was member of the &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20and%20Reformed%20Church\"&gt;Evangelical and Reformed Church&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;(UCC)--congregation founded after 1957.&lt;BR&gt;(union)--congregation resulting from merger of former CC, E&amp;R, and UCC congregations.&lt;BR&gt;*--indicates congregation endorses the \"Open and Affirming\" program of the UCC Coalition for &lt;a href=\"homosexual\"&gt;Gay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lesbian\"&gt;Lesbian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bisexual\"&gt;Bisexual&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Transgender\"&gt;Transgender&lt;/a&gt; Concerns, a recognized affinity group.\nCentral Southeast Ohio Association.\nThis association is the smallest of the five numerically; headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Columbus%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Columbus&lt;/a&gt;, it occupies not only central and southeastern Ohio, but some churches in adjoining parts of &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; as well. Despite its small size, it is home to the Conference's oldest congregation, First Congregational in &lt;a href=\"Marietta%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Marietta&lt;/a&gt;, established during the first settlements of the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Territory\"&gt;Northwest Territory&lt;/a&gt; in 1796.\nEastern Ohio Association.\nHeadquartered in &lt;a href=\"Canton%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Canton&lt;/a&gt;, the association centers around that city and the cities of &lt;a href=\"Akron%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Akron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warren%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Warren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Youngstown%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Youngstown&lt;/a&gt;, extending up to the southernmost suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;; however, most of the churches are located in small towns or in the open countryside. Most of its congregations were members of the Southeast Ohio Synod of the E&amp;R Church prior to the UCC merger, having been established in the 19th century by &lt;a href=\"German-Americans\"&gt;German-Americans&lt;/a&gt; from adjoining &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the churches have a reputation of being quite conservative theologically and socially, to the point of some conflict with association, conference, and national leadership. The EOA is the Ohio Conference's largest association, in terms of both membership and number of congregations.\nNorthwest Ohio Association.\nLike the Eastern Ohio Association at the opposite end of the state, this association is characteristically rural, with most of its congregations stemming from &lt;a href=\"German%20Reformed\"&gt;German Reformed&lt;/a&gt; roots. &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt; is the only major metropolitan area within its bounds. Two UCC-related colleges are located in the territory: &lt;a href=\"Defiance%20College\"&gt;Defiance College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Defiance%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Defiance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg%20University\"&gt;Heidelberg University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Tiffin&lt;/a&gt;; the schools derive from, respectively, Christian and Reformed origins. The city of Tiffin serves as headquarters for the association also.\nSouthwest Ohio Northern Kentucky Association.\nPossibly the most urbanized (and suburbanized) of the five associations, this group includes congregations in the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dayton%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Dayton&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan areas, as well as the cities of &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Springfield%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Springfield&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Kentucky\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; congregations are located across the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20River\"&gt;Ohio River&lt;/a&gt; from Cincinnati, within a 20-mile radius.\nThe northern part of the association contains the greatest concentration of Christian-heritage congregations in the Ohio Conference, many having been founded by settlers from &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and Kentucky in the 1810s and 1820s. Some of the Cincinnati-area congregations were started originally as Evangelical Protestant churches, a German-language free-church movement that first appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pittsburgh, Pa.&lt;/a&gt; area in the early 19th century. In 1925, this small group joined the Congregational Christian Churches; some of its churches were also located in &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Louis%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; in addition to Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. Congregations deriving from this heritage will be marked (CC-EP).\nWestern Reserve Association.\nAround the turn of the 19th century, settlers from &lt;a href=\"Connecticut\"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; came into the region along the southern shore of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Erie\"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt;, bringing &lt;a href=\"Puritan\"&gt;Puritan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Congregationalist%20polity\"&gt;Congregationalism&lt;/a&gt; with them. Not only did churches prosper in the settlement, but other institutions bearing the Congregationalist stamp such as &lt;a href=\"Oberlin%20College\"&gt;Oberlin College&lt;/a&gt;, one of the U.S.' first &lt;a href=\"coeducational\"&gt;coeducational&lt;/a&gt; places of higher learning, as well. In the years preceding the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, pastors and laity often became staunch proponents for the &lt;a href=\"Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;abolition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;; some devoted missionaries went to the South after the war to teach newly emancipated African-Americans, under the auspices of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Missionary%20Association\"&gt;American Missionary Association&lt;/a&gt;\nMany, if not most, churches in this five-county association (&lt;a href=\"Ashtabula%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Ashtabula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuyahoga%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cuyahoga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Geauga%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Geauga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lake%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Lake&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lorain%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Lorain&lt;/a&gt;) carry on much of that politically and socially progressive mission and advocacy to this day. Moreover, the E&amp;R-heritage congregations in the region were generally less inclined toward traditionalism than those elsewhere in Ohio, adding their ethnic flavor to a quintessential \"&lt;a href=\"Yankee\"&gt;Yankee&lt;/a&gt;\" church. The association's territory encompasses virtually all of the &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Cleveland metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause Cleveland houses the national headquarters of the UCC, many of the ordained staff members there hold their ministerial standing in this association."
