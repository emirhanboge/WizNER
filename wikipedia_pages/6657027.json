In 2016, the club was officially merged with city rivals &lt;a href=\"Dolphins%20F.C.%20%28Port%20Harcourt%29\"&gt;Dolphins F.C.&lt;/a&gt; and the two teams became collectively known as &lt;a href=\"Rivers%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Rivers United F.C.&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nSharks were almost relocated to &lt;a href=\"Abeokuta\"&gt;Abeokuta&lt;/a&gt; in 1998 due to crowd problems. In protest, they missed the last six games of the 1998 Professional League, finished bottom of the league on 32 points and were suspended for two years.\n2009\u201310.\nThey started the 2009\u201310 season slow out of the gate, anchored to the bottom of the table and going through three managers when &lt;a href=\"Kadiri%20Ikhana\"&gt;Kadiri Ikhana&lt;/a&gt; left after eight games. On 27 February 2010 they were suspended indefinitely by the league for \"noncompliance of statutes\" after a shakeup of their management staff. This was after the team was robbed in &lt;a href=\"Edo%20State\"&gt;Edo State&lt;/a&gt; on their way back from a minicamp in &lt;a href=\"Abuja\"&gt;Abuja&lt;/a&gt;. They managed to finish in 16th place with 48 points, avoiding relegation by one point.\nMerger with Dolphins.\nAfter relegation in 2016, the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Rivers%20State\"&gt;Government of Rivers State&lt;/a&gt; merged the Sharks F.C. with their rivals &lt;a href=\"Dolphins%20F.C.%20%28Port%20Harcourt%29\"&gt;Dolphins F.C.&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href=\"Rivers%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Rivers United F.C.&lt;/a&gt; which took Dolphins' slot in the Premier League."
