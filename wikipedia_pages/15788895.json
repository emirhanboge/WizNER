    "text": "The \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya%20Episode.G\"&gt;Saint Seiya Episode.G&lt;/a&gt;\" manga features a large number of fictional characters, both created by its author, &lt;a href=\"Megumu%20Okada\"&gt;Megumu Okada&lt;/a&gt;, and by &lt;a href=\"Masami%20Kurumada\"&gt;Masami Kurumada&lt;/a&gt;, author of the original \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya\"&gt;Saint Seiya&lt;/a&gt;\" universe in which the story takes place. \"Episode.G\" acts as a &lt;a href=\"prequel\"&gt;prequel&lt;/a&gt; to Kurumada's work and it is set seven years before the events of the first manga, in a fictional universe where the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Greek%20mythological%20figures\"&gt;Greek gods&lt;/a&gt; cyclically reincarnate into the world to wage war on each other for dominance. Okada takes characters who had played only a supporting role in the original series and puts them in the position of protagonists. The old main characters appear only briefly, in &lt;a href=\"flashforward\"&gt;flashforward&lt;/a&gt;s of the future.\nThe protagonists of the story are the Gold Saints, an elite group of twelve warriors devoted to the goddess &lt;a href=\"Athena%20%28Saint%20Seiya%29\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;, whose duty is to protect the Earth from evil and maintain peace and justice. Among them, Leo Aiolia plays the role of main character. The antagonists are the twelve Titans and the primordial god Pontos, a group of ancient gods who escaped from the prison of Tartarus, where they had been confined in since the mythological era. They seek to overthrow the Olympian gods and regain control of the Earth. The Titans are led by Kronos, father of the leader of the Olympian gods, Zeus, and are assisted by an army of Giants and other evil creatures.\nSeveral merchandise items depicting the main characters of \"Episode.G\" have been released with the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya%20Episode.G%23Special%20editions\"&gt;limited edition volumes&lt;/a&gt;. The sharp differences and similarities between Okada's characters and Kurumada's, however, have been a target of both criticism and praise among critics.\nCreation and conception.\nMost of the protagonists were originally created by &lt;a href=\"Masami%20Kurumada\"&gt;Masami Kurumada&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced them in his 1986 manga \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya\"&gt;Saint Seiya&lt;/a&gt;\" as &lt;a href=\"supporting%20character\"&gt;supporting character&lt;/a&gt;s and, at one point, antagonists. In the first volume of \"Episode.G\", author &lt;a href=\"Megumu%20Okada\"&gt;Megumu Okada&lt;/a&gt; has commented that his intention was to write a prequel to the original story and critics have noted that he has done a good job in making the characters his own while staying true to their original concept. Okada adopted the colour schemes of either the original manga or its anime adaptation and used the same fighting techniques and mottoes that identified each character in Kurumada's manga. The story has many dialogues and situations that refer to the original manga. At the same time, Okada adds to their &lt;a href=\"back-stories\"&gt;back-stories&lt;/a&gt; and renovates designs according to his personal drawing style. Characters appear more stylised, \"anorexic and androgynous\" in the words of Manga-News's critic, and are drawn with enhanced details, especially on clothing and armours. Entire scenes have been taken directly from Kurumada's work and replicated in \"Episode.G\", with the only change being the drawing style.\nThe antagonists of \"Episode.G\" appear in the \"Saint Seiya\" franchise for the first time in this manga. Most are based on &lt;a href=\"Greek%20mythology\"&gt;Greek mythology&lt;/a&gt;, but it is also possible to find a few characters inspired by &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion\"&gt;Egyptian mythology&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the supporting characters also appear solely in this manga, while others, especially among the &lt;a href=\"%23Silver%20and%20Bronze%20Saints\"&gt;Silver Saints&lt;/a&gt;, were previously established in the \"Saint Seiya\" universe by Kurumada.\nProtagonists.\nThe &lt;a href=\"protagonist\"&gt;protagonist&lt;/a&gt;s of \"Saint Seiya Episode.G\" are Athena's Saints. Devoted to the goddess , they are sworn to defend the Earth from danger and the influence of evil gods. Although Athena's Saints are only human, their use of \u2013 the energy of the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bang\"&gt;Big Bang&lt;/a&gt; that remains inside every being \u2013 gives them superhuman strength and allows them to perform formidable feats. It is said that their fists can rend the sky and their kicks can split the earth. Since their bodies are still as frail as any ordinary man's, however, Athena gifts her Saints with protective armours called which are linked to the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20constellations\"&gt;constellations&lt;/a&gt;. As such, Saints are usually referred to by their guardian constellation and their given name.\nThere are eighty-eight Saints in total, as many as the constellations, and they are divided into three hierarchic categories according to power: the lowest-ranked are the Bronze Saints, followed by the Silver Saints, then the twelve elite Gold Saints. Cloths also reflect this classification system, being usually divided into Bronze, Silver and Gold Cloths, the latter being the most effective and durable. The home and training ground of the Saints is the , an isolated location in Athens, Greece, that only Saints, apprentices and their servants have access to. Their leader is the representative of the goddess Athena, the .\nThe concept of the Saints, as well as most of the characters that make up their ranks, was first created by Masami Kurumada. In this manga, it was expanded upon by Megumu Okada to include new characters and develop aspects related to the organisation of Sanctuary that had been left undefined in \"Saint Seiya\".\nGold Saints.\nThe are the main protagonists of \"Episode.G\". They possess full mastery of their Cosmo through their and as such can move at the speed of light. They are the mightiest of Athena's Saints and guardians of the , the series of twelve temples that defends the Pope's chambers and the massive statue of Athena overlooking Sanctuary. Their constellations are those situated over the &lt;a href=\"ecliptic\"&gt;ecliptic&lt;/a&gt;, the twelve constellations of the &lt;a href=\"zodiac\"&gt;zodiac&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeo Aiolia.\n is the main character of \"Episode.G\". He is the thirteen-year-old Gold Saint of Leo and the younger brother of &lt;a href=\"%23Sagittarius%20Aiolos\"&gt;Sagittarius Aiolos&lt;/a&gt;. He was first created by Masami Kurumada and is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Hiro%20Shimono\"&gt;Hiro Shimono&lt;/a&gt; in the released &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya%20Episode.G%23Drama%20CDs\"&gt;Drama CDs&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite being a natural blond, Aiolia dyes his hair red to distance himself from his brother, whom most of Sanctuary believes to be a traitor. However, it is made evident that even though he resents his brother and suffers immensely because of him, he still loves him very much. This conflict is behind the grudge he holds against the rest of the Gold Saints and it often drives him to fight them and challenge the &lt;a href=\"%23Gemini%20Saga\"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt;'s commands. Aiolia holds his loved ones close to his heart, particularly his servants &lt;a href=\"%23Lithos%20Chrysalis\"&gt;Lithos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Galan\"&gt;Galan&lt;/a&gt;, whom he considers to be family. As taught by &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;John Black&lt;/a&gt;, he proudly fights, not for himself, but to protect everyone and everything he holds dear.\nHis fierce personality, Cosmo and battle skills attract the attention of &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt;, who acknowledges him as a potential menace to his plans, and &lt;a href=\"%23Ebony%20Hyperion\"&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt;, whom he encounters during the Titan's first invasion of Sanctuary. They refer to the Leo Saint as the \"man of the Evil Omen\" and &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt; prophesies that he will be the one to release him from Zeus's seal.\nAt one point, Aiolia is assigned to protect &lt;a href=\"%23Virgo%20Shaka\"&gt;Shaka&lt;/a&gt; while the Virgo Saint enters a deep meditation to banish the evil monsters that the Titans' presence on Earth had called forth. He then faces &lt;a href=\"%23Dark%20Lightning%20Koios\"&gt;Koios&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Overwhelmed by the Titan's power, the memory of his brother offers Aiolia the encouragement and strength he needed to unleash the \"Photon Burst\", an attack Aiolos had once advised him to never use. With it, he defeats Koios and would have destroyed him if not for Hyperion's intervention. Aiolia dedicates the technique to his brother, saying that he created it to protect him.\nAiolia shows his mettle again while fighting Kronos, the Titan King, the second time the Titans invade Sanctuary. He professes his belief that humanity is not worthless and that the Titans have no right to interfere with their lives. Severely wounded, he strikes Kronos with his \"Photon Burst\". The Titanesses, however, keep the attack from annihilating their King and Kronos is freed. Kronos comes out of the fight with no idea of who he is and the other Titans, believing this is due to Aiolia's attack, lay down a plan to lure the Saint into the Time Labyrinth to restore their King's memory. After &lt;a href=\"%23Dimension%20Iapetos\"&gt;Iapetos&lt;/a&gt; kidnaps Lithos, Aiolia does not hesitate to follow him into the Titans' domain, where he battles not just Iapetos and &lt;a href=\"%23Themis\"&gt;Themis&lt;/a&gt; a second time, but also Pontos, Koios (who entrusts him the god-slaying power \"Keraunos\"), Hyperion and a restored Kronos.\nAlthough the original series does not mention any peculiarity about Aiolia's Cosmo, in \"Episode.G\" it is portrayed as electrical in nature. His fighting techniques therefore involve electricity in some manner. They are: the single-hit , the multiple-hit , the multidirectional , and the ultimate . The first two were introduced in Kurumada's \"Saint Seiya\", while the last two are exclusive to Okada's \"Episode.G\".\nAries Mu.\n is a Gold Saint who lives in Jamir, &lt;a href=\"Tibet\"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;, and the only person in the world who can repair damaged Cloths. His character was first created by Masami Kurumada, but Okada adopts the colour scheme present in the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Saint%20Seiya%20media\"&gt;\"Saint Seiya\" anime&lt;/a&gt;, switching Mu's original long blond hair to lilac. He has two dots in the place of his eyebrows.\nHe is a descendant of the people of the &lt;a href=\"Mu%20%28lost%20continent%29\"&gt;Lost Continent of Mu&lt;/a&gt; and possesses his ancestors' distinctive trait: a powerful psychokinetic ability which allows him to restrain his enemies and teleport himself and others. He is a pacifist, but also a fierce warrior. The technique he inherited from his master, the former Pope &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Aries Shion&lt;/a&gt;, is so powerful that it can destroy a &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Hecatonchire&lt;/a&gt; in one strike. His other fighting techniques are the and the , all of which were designed by Kurumada.\nMu battles &lt;a href=\"%23Dimension%20Iapetos\"&gt;Dimension Iapetos&lt;/a&gt; in Jamir and repairs &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt;'s Cloth in the aftermath of the first invasion of Sanctuary. Later, he aids the Leo Saint again, by teleporting the &lt;a href=\"%23Virgo%20Shaka\"&gt;Virgo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Scorpio%20Milo\"&gt;Scorpio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Taurus%20Aldebaran\"&gt;Taurus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Aquarius%20Camus\"&gt;Aquarius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Capricorn%20Shura\"&gt;Capricorn&lt;/a&gt; Saints into the Time Labyrinth to fight the &lt;a href=\"%23Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaurus Aldebaran.\n is depicted as a friendly, punctual person who enjoys life and likes to buy little souvenirs. He dislikes saying bad things behind anyone else's backs and never hesitates to help a companion.\nHe was prepared to sacrifice himself so that the Leo Cloth, broken by Hyperion, could be repaired, but it proved unnecessary, as &lt;a href=\"%23Aries%20Mu\"&gt;Mu&lt;/a&gt; used his own blood. He remains in Jamir while Mu recovers, until the &lt;a href=\"%23Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; attack Sanctuary. His strong beliefs and ability to learn from past mistakes allow him to defeat &lt;a href=\"%23Themis\"&gt;Themis&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Brabeus Talanton\", which was smashing &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Capricorn%20Shura\"&gt;Shura&lt;/a&gt; under the weight of their sins. Later, he steps forth to help Aiolia once more, answering Mu's call to go fight the Titans at the Time Labyrinth.\nThis character was first created by Masami Kurumada. Megumu Okada stays true to that design's colour scheme, making Aldebaran a blond. Like in the original manga, he has only one fighting technique: the .\nGemini Saga.\n is both a protagonist and one of the central antagonists. He is responsible for many tragedies that have plagued &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20%28Saint%20Seiya%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. This information, however, remains undisclosed to most who follow him.\nSaga was once a kind and honourable Gold Saint, but an evil presence lurks within him that only his twin brother &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Kanon&lt;/a&gt; knew of. After Kanon confronts him about this and reveals to him his dark intentions of taking over Sanctuary, Saga declares his brother to be pure evil and locks him in Cape Sounion, in a watery prison designed to contain &lt;a href=\"Athena%20%28Saint%20Seiya%29\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt;'s enemies. Some time later, however, evil finally consumes him and Saga murders &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Pope Shion&lt;/a&gt;. He then starts impersonating Shion and controlling Sanctuary to further his ambitions. To hide his true identity, he wears a helmet that obscures his face at all times.\nHe conspires with &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt;, and the Titan King gives him a golden dagger that has the power to kill gods. Saga uses it to attempt to kill the infant Athena, but &lt;a href=\"%23Sagittarius%20Aiolos\"&gt;Aiolos&lt;/a&gt; interrupts him and saves her. As a result, Saga declares Aiolos a traitor to Sanctuary.\nHe is a morally complex character. As in \"Saint Seiya\", there are two sides to his personality that often argue. After Kronos arrives at Sanctuary to reclaim the \"Megas Drepanon\", his evil side orders the Saints not to engage in battle. His good side, however, is unable to stand by and rises to fight the Titan. Saga uses the golden dagger Kronos had once given him, but before he can kill Kronos, his evil side takes control again.\nHe is capable of creating illusions and controlling his cloth from a distance to deceive an enemy. His fighting techniques are , , and , which only the Pope can use.\nSaga was first created by Masami Kurumada. Okada adopts the colour scheme seen in the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya\"&gt;original manga&lt;/a&gt; rather than the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Saint%20Seiya%20media\"&gt;anime&lt;/a&gt;'s. As such, Saga has dark hair when his evil side prevails and light hair when his good side takes over. Saga also establishes a comparison between himself and the Greek god of War Ares, something which is absent from Kurumada's original work but which was suggested in the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Saint%20Seiya%20anime-only%20characters%23Pope%20Ares%27%20Minions\"&gt;animated version&lt;/a&gt;.\nCancer Deathmask.\n is one of the few people who know of &lt;a href=\"%23Gemini%20Saga\"&gt;Saga&lt;/a&gt;'s true nature and his disguise as the Pope, yet he remains loyal to him since Saga's beliefs mirror his own. He believes firmly that power defines what is just and that only with a ruthless iron will can the world be at peace. He is proud to be evil and not afraid to admit it. Rude, cunning and violent by nature, he will not hesitate to play dirty or mercilessly kill women, children, the aged or the diseased to reach his goal. He considers each kill a trophy of his greatness and thus fills the Temple of Cancer with his victim's death masks, a practice which earned him his name. While most consider the echoes of the dead in his Temple horrifying, Deathmask finds them pleasant.\nDeathmask does not care to hide his scorn towards &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Sagittarius%20Aiolos\"&gt;his brother&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the two strongly dislike each other. At one point, the two of them fight, despite it being forbidden for Gold Saints to do so. Later, during the Giants' assault on Sanctuary, he defeats &lt;a href=\"%23Giants\"&gt;Kyanos Pyrokus&lt;/a&gt; with his single fighting technique, the .\nDeathmask was first created by Masami Kurumada, but Megumu Okada uses the colour scheme of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Saint%20Seiya%20media\"&gt;anime&lt;/a&gt;, giving him dark blue hair instead of black.\nVirgo Shaka.\n is a powerful Gold Saint. He has long blond hair and wears a &lt;a href=\"Bindi%20%28decoration%29\"&gt;bindi&lt;/a&gt; on his forehead. He was first created by Masami Kurumada.\nHe has a keen sense of Cosmo and uses it as a substitute for his eyes, which he keeps closed most of the time to heighten his power. Upon confronting &lt;a href=\"%23Giants\"&gt;Kyanos Pyrokus&lt;/a&gt;, who is then invisible, Shaka says that in this world there is nothing he cannot see. More than once, he is the first to sense some dark Cosmo at work nearby.\nHe recognises &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt;'s potential early on, but prefers not to make any kind of judgement on his still maturing character. Aiolia sees him as meddlesome and arrogant then, and it is not until he is assigned the task of protecting the Virgo Saint while Shaka enters a deep meditation to cleanse the world of the evil influence of the Titans and risks his life to keep Dark Lightning Koios at bay that the two start to become friends. Later, Shaka is one of the few Gold Saints who answers &lt;a href=\"%23Aries%20Mu\"&gt;Mu&lt;/a&gt;'s call and goes to help Aiolia at the Time Labyrinth. Together, they defeat &lt;a href=\"%23Dimension%20Iapetos\"&gt;Iapetos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Themis\"&gt;Themis&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike other Saints, his religion is &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;. His attacks involve Buddhist teachings, using meditation to create illusions, manipulate dimensions, nullify attacks and counter-attack. They are: , , and .\nLibra Dohko.\n is the last living former-generation Saint, one of the two survivors from the previous Holy War along with &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Shion&lt;/a&gt;. Athena charged him with the secret mission to keep watch over a sealed evil and so, for the past 236 years, he has never left his post at the Five Old Peaks in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Lu\"&gt;Rozan&lt;/a&gt;, China, not even to answer the Pope's summon to an urgent meeting, the . When &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt; attacks &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance of the Time Labyrinth, Dohko sends his Libra Cloth and creates a projection of himself to defend his fellow Saint.\nDohko was originally created by Masami Kurumada and he is one of the few characters who appears in all four &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya%23Manga\"&gt;manga of the \"Saint Seiya\" franchise&lt;/a&gt;.\nScorpio Milo.\n is a close friend of &lt;a href=\"%23Aquarius%20Camus\"&gt;Camus&lt;/a&gt;. He is very proud of the reputation of the Gold Saints as a group and extremely loyal to Sanctuary. Because of this, he will fulfil any mission appointed to him, even if it goes against his personal desires.\nHe disapproves of &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt;'s crude manner and mistrusts him greatly because of his brother's deeds and the stain they cast on the Gold Saints' reputation. Despite condemning Aiolia, however, sometimes he shows that he is just as rash and immature, like when he is caught in an argument with the Leo Saint and calls him \"Stupid Cat\".\nHe does not hesitate to fight when Sanctuary is in danger. He battles and defeats the Trojan hero &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Hector&lt;/a&gt;, whom &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt; had revived, exposing his belief that, while he respects History, the future should be written by those who live in the present. This idea is shared by Aiolia and it becomes common ground that helps to finally bring them closer. Milo is one of the Gold Saints who answers &lt;a href=\"%23Aries%20Mu\"&gt;Mu&lt;/a&gt;'s call to go help Aiolia in the Time Labyrinth \u2013 although he stubbornly refuses to acknowledge him as a friend even then. His attacks are the and its death blow, .\nHe was created by Masami Kurumada. Megumu Okada retains the colour scheme of the original manga, having a blond Milo rather than the more popularly known blue-haired version of the anime.\nSagittarius Aiolos.\n is &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt;'s older brother and a prominent figure in the story, despite having been killed six years before the start of the main part of \"Episode.G\". He was created by Masami Kurumada. Megumu Okada further develops his personality and back-story, adopting the colour scheme of the original manga, where Aiolos is a blond. He is one of the main characters in the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya%20Episode.G%23Special%20chapters\"&gt;special \"Volume 0\"&lt;/a&gt;, which is named after him.\nSagittarius is an extremely brave and righteous Saint, who has a playful personality. He fell into disgrace and was ultimately killed after keeping &lt;a href=\"%23Gemini%20Saga\"&gt;Saga&lt;/a&gt; from murdering the newly reincarnated Athena. Disguised as Pope, Saga shifts the blame onto him and orders &lt;a href=\"%23Capricorn%20Shura\"&gt;Shura&lt;/a&gt; to kill him on the charge of treason. His resulting bad reputation greatly affects his younger brother.\nAiolos trained Aiolia to become a Saint and his spirit still appears from time to time to guide his little brother, despite the latter's resentment of him. He was also a friend of &lt;a href=\"%23Galan\"&gt;Galan&lt;/a&gt;, who eventually becomes his brother's servant. The two once had a stand-off after Galan was caught stealing Athena's holy blood. Aiolos destroyed &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Typhon&lt;/a&gt; after the monster caused a ship-wreck in 1973, and single-handedly defeated the Sun God's Army. Accompanied by a young Aiolia, he visited Egypt on orders to investigate the recently exposed tomb of the Sun God &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Apophis&lt;/a&gt;, from which a suspicious Cosmo emanated. He defeats the Sun God with his special attack, the , but unknowingly frees &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt; in the process.\nCapricorn Shura.\nMegumu Okada's reconciles the previous versions of the character found in Kurumada's manga and the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Saint%20Seiya%20media\"&gt;anime&lt;/a&gt;. In \"Episode.G\", Shura is a very loyal Gold Saint, but when he uncovers the truth about &lt;a href=\"%23Sagittarius%20Aiolos\"&gt;Aiolos&lt;/a&gt;'s innocence and confronts &lt;a href=\"%23Gemini%20Saga\"&gt;the false Pope&lt;/a&gt; about it, he falls under the effect of Saga's \"Illusion Demon Emperor's Fist\", a technique that controls the mind of its victim. Bound to Saga's will, Shura starts to follow his orders, while remaining loyal to &lt;a href=\"Athena%20%28Saint%20Seiya%29\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; at heart.\nHe fights several soldiers from the Titans' army during their second assault on Sanctuary, as well as &lt;a href=\"%23Giants\"&gt;Phaios Spathe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Galaxy%20Kreios\"&gt;Kreios&lt;/a&gt;. He helps Aiolia fight &lt;a href=\"%23Themis\"&gt;Themis&lt;/a&gt; at the top of Sanctuary after &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt;'s release and later answers &lt;a href=\"%23Aries%20Mu\"&gt;Mu&lt;/a&gt;'s appeal to go help the Leo Saint at the Time Labyrinth. There, he has a rematch with Kreios, who acknowledges Shura's might and bequeaths him the power of his sword and Cosmo after his defeat. In battle, Shura's limbs are like sharp swords, thanks to his fighting technique .\nAquarius Camus.\n is a stoic and honourable Saint who protects the innocent, be they soldiers of Sanctuary or common people who follow the Titans. He believes that Gold Saints should keep a cool head at all times and not get carried away to reassure those of inferior rank who look up to them in times of crisis.\nHe can use his Cosmo to freeze anything, from water to enemy soldiers or even a &lt;a href=\"%23Titans\"&gt;Titan's Soma&lt;/a&gt;. His techniques can reach the &lt;a href=\"absolute%20zero\"&gt;absolute zero&lt;/a&gt;. They are: , , , and .\nAt one point, he faces &lt;a href=\"%23Current%20Okeanos\"&gt;Current Okeanos&lt;/a&gt;. He then exposes more of his beliefs, telling the Titan that if gods like him have the right to toy with human lives, then humans should have the right to choose which gods they want to follow. He claims that gods like the Titans, who do not comprehend the value of life, are unable to truly appreciate the immortality they possess and do not deserve to be worshipped.\nHe allows Aiolia to enter the Time Labyrinth to save the abducted &lt;a href=\"%23Lithos%20Chrysalis\"&gt;Lithos&lt;/a&gt;, but stays behind to freeze the entrance so that the Titans' army cannot invade the Earth. There, he asks Aiolia to have faith in his companions and trust in the rest of the Gold Saints. Later, thanks to &lt;a href=\"%23Aries%20Mu\"&gt;Mu&lt;/a&gt;, he is able to rejoin the Leo Saint to fight.\nCamus was first created by Masami Kurumada, but Megumu Okada uses the colour scheme seen in the animated version, having a teal-haired Camus, instead of a red-head like in the \"Saint Seiya\" manga. He is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Hikaru%20Midorikawa\"&gt;Hikaru Midorikawa&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya%20Episode.G%23Drama%20CDs\"&gt;Drama CDs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPisces Aphrodite.\n is a &lt;a href=\"narcissistic\"&gt;narcissistic&lt;/a&gt; and merciless individual. He is often seen thinking about the beauty of battle and calling victory as the greatest beauty that crowns the strongest warrior. He was first created by Masami Kurumada and is recognisable by his long light teal hair and &lt;a href=\"beauty%20mark\"&gt;beauty mark&lt;/a&gt; under the left eye.\nAfter the Titans' gate is discovered, the &lt;a href=\"%23Gemini%20Saga\"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt; sends him to cover the entrance of the Time Labyrinth with his deadly roses so none may cross it. Aphrodite saves the defenceless &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; from the attacks of the followers of the Titans. After an argument between the two Gold Saints, since Aiolia was against Aphrodite's bloodlust, the Giant &lt;a href=\"%23Giants\"&gt;Anthrakma Zugylos&lt;/a&gt; appears. Aphrodite saves Aiolia from Zugylos's deadly mace and kills the Giant. He returns to Sanctuary afterwards, leaving behind a carpet of vines and roses at the exit of that world to prevent an invasion on Sanctuary.\nOther than his techniques involving roses, the , the , and the , Aphrodite can create and manipulate large rose vines. He uses them to restrain and strangle his targets, create massive vine blades and defensive cocoons to protect and heal himself or another through his Cosmo.\nSilver and Bronze Saints.\nThe are the second highest-ranked and the second most powerful group of Saints. They play a supporting role in the story, fighting the forces of evil in the Gold Saints' absence. are the lowest-ranked group of Athena's Saints. Only one has played a significant part in the story, although the Bronze Saints of the future, the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Saint%20Seiya%20characters%23Protagonists\"&gt;protagonists of \"Saint Seiya\"&lt;/a&gt;, have appeared in several brief &lt;a href=\"flashforward\"&gt;flashforward&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEagle Marin.\n is an enigmatic Japanese Silver Saint with a strong personality and a keen sense of duty, created by Masami Kurumada. She first appears after &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt;'s match against &lt;a href=\"%23Ebony%20Hyperion\"&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt; and saves the injured Gold Saint and &lt;a href=\"%23Lithos%20Chrysalis\"&gt;Lithos&lt;/a&gt; from soldiers who had stayed behind with her attack. Later, she fights the Giant &lt;a href=\"%23Giants\"&gt;Phoinikeos Rhuax&lt;/a&gt;, but Aiolia steps in to save her.\nAs a female Saint, she is required to cover her face with a mask, signifying that she has renounced her femininity and is equal to men. Nonetheless, during her brief appearances, it is implied that the Leo Saint has a slight crush on her.\nTriangle Noesis.\n is a noble Silver Saint, created by Megumu Okada. He was killed when he and his apprentice &lt;a href=\"%23Lynx%20Retsu\"&gt;Lynx Retsu&lt;/a&gt; encounter the gorgon &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Euryale&lt;/a&gt;. After having half of his body turned to stone while protecting Retsu, he uses his attack, , in hopes of weakening the gorgon. The rest of his body is subsequently petrified and all but his right side, where his Cosmo continued to inhabit even after death, crumbles. When Retsu later comes to kill the monster, both their Cosmos join and, with the last remnants of his soul, they defeat the gorgon.\nOphiuchus Shaina.\n is a fierce female Silver Saint, created by Masami Kurumada. She is seen fighting a &lt;a href=\"smilodon\"&gt;sabre-toothed tiger&lt;/a&gt; that had been resurrected with the release of &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt; and protecting a group of researchers alongside &lt;a href=\"%23Lynx%20Retsu\"&gt;Lynx Retsu&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of an Egyptian jungle. Her fighting technique is the . As all female Saints, she hides her face behind a mask to be considered equal to men.\nLizard Misty.\n is a vain, but proud Silver Saint, first created by Masami Kurumada. He appears accompanied by &lt;a href=\"%23Lynx%20Retsu\"&gt;Lynx Retsu&lt;/a&gt; and the archaeologist &lt;a href=\"%23Miko%20Hasegawa\"&gt;Miko Hasegawa&lt;/a&gt;, and is seen destroying a monster made out of the souls of the dead who no longer had a body to return to that had been brought back to Earth by &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt;'s power with his special technique, the .\nLynx Retsu.\n is an orphan who was raised by his master, &lt;a href=\"%23Triangle%20Noesis\"&gt;Triangle Noesis&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after receiving his Bronze Lynx Cloth, he and his master go to explore a cave where a mysterious, dangerous Cosmo lurked. There, they discover a &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;gorgon&lt;/a&gt;, which had been revived by the Titans' awakening. His master sacrifices himself to save him, telling Retsu to alert Sanctuary of the danger. &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; arrives afterwards and Retsu pleads him to let him finish the creature. To satisfy his wishes, Aiolia lies and says that he is only a messenger sent to make sure Retsu, who is assigned the task of defeating the monster, accomplishes that mission. With the help of Triangle Noesis's spirit, Retsu manages to defeat the gorgon and avenge his master with his special attack, . Retsu is later seen fighting off several evil creatures in Egypt, with the help of &lt;a href=\"%23Ophiuchus%20Shaina\"&gt;Ophiuchus Shaina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Lizard%20Misty\"&gt;Lizard Misty&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis character was created by Megumu Okada and is exclusive to \"Episode.G\".\nOthers affiliated with Athena.\nLithos Chrysalis.\n is &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt;'s servant, who once mistook her for a boy and now sees her as his little sister. She is an innocent girl with short green hair. Her father was a sculptor who died while working on an order for Sanctuary. Haunted by what would become of his daughter, his soul possesses one of his giant stone statues. During a mission, Aiolia promises his tortured soul that he will take care of Lithos until she is able to take care of herself, thus releasing him from the emotional weight binding him to this world and allowing him to rest. After &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt;'s release, &lt;a href=\"%23Dimension%20Iapetos\"&gt;Iapetos&lt;/a&gt; kidnaps Lithos to lure Aiolia into the Titan's realm and she befriends an amnesiac Kronos.\nLithos was created by Megumu Okada and is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Chiwa%20Sait%C5%8D\"&gt;Chiwa Sait\u014d&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya%20Episode.G%23Drama%20CDs\"&gt;Drama CDs&lt;/a&gt;.\nGalan.\nHis full name is , but he is usually called instead. He was an old friend of &lt;a href=\"%23Sagittarius%20Aiolos\"&gt;Aiolos&lt;/a&gt; and was once a candidate for the Leo Gold Cloth.\nAt some point before Aiolos's death, Galan's mother falls ill and he steals Athena's sacred blood to cure her. By the time he gets to her, however, his mother is already dead. After he is caught, he is imprisoned at Cape Sounion and sentenced to fight a warrior, and so he asks his friend Aiolos to deliver that punishment. During the fight, Aiolos takes off his Gold Cloth so they can fight at the same level, but he still defeats Galan, who loses his right eye and arm and starts using a metal arm as replacement. After Aiolos's alleged betrayal, Galan stays to live with &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; and takes care of him even though the young Leo is also called a traitor. Aiolia thus starts to see Galan as family.\nGalan was created by Megumu Okada and is voiced by &lt;a href=\"K%C5%8Dji%20Yusa\"&gt;K\u014dji Yusa&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya%20Episode.G%23Drama%20CDs\"&gt;Drama CDs&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiko Hasegawa.\n is a Japanese archaeologist who specialises in ancient Egypt and speaks very bad English. She discovers some ruins that had been exposed with the completion of the &lt;a href=\"Aswan%20Dam\"&gt;Aswan Dam&lt;/a&gt; and proceeds to investigate them, escorted by &lt;a href=\"%23Sagittarius%20Aiolos\"&gt;Aiolos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt;. There, they find an ancient evil sealed and are attacked by numerous monsters that had been drawn to that power, including the snake-god &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Apophis&lt;/a&gt;. The two brothers, however, easily defeat them. Miko later appears in &lt;a href=\"%23Lizard%20Misty\"&gt;Lizard Misty&lt;/a&gt;'s company, having been asked by Sanctuary to investigate some strange phenomena in Egypt.\nShe was created by Megumu Okada and appears exclusively in \"Episode.G\".\nAntagonists.\nTitans.\nChildren of &lt;a href=\"%23Gaia\"&gt;Gaia&lt;/a&gt; and Uranus, the are twelve deities that ruled the world in ancient times. They rose to power after the youngest Titan, &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt;, took arms against his tyrannical father and killed him at the urge of his mother. Cursed by Uranus to suffer the same fate, however, Kronos became a tyrant in turn and was defeated and sealed into &lt;a href=\"Tartarus\"&gt;Tartarus&lt;/a&gt; along with the rest of the Titans by Zeus, his son, after a battle known as the &lt;a href=\"Titanomachy\"&gt;Titanomachy&lt;/a&gt;. Revived by &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt; and with the serving as their headquarters, the Titans seek to once more establish themselves as rulers of the Earth.\nTheir weapons and armours are called and their power is that of the divine Cosmo called . Each Titan also possesses a planet or a star they can draw power from. The Titan King's Soma is guarded by Athena's Saints, which leads them to attack &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20%28Saint%20Seiya%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey first appear as the main antagonists of \"Episode.G\", but some of them later help the &lt;a href=\"%23Gold%20Saints\"&gt;Gold Saints&lt;/a&gt;, as they discover that Pontos had been manipulating them for his own ends.\nKronos.\n is the youngest of the Titans and rules as their King. He is self-centred and arrogant, refusing to acknowledge any other god but himself. He is also very authoritarian and dismissive of the power of humans.\nUnlike the rest of his siblings, the divine weapon gifted to him by &lt;a href=\"%23Gaia\"&gt;Gaia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"scythe\"&gt;scythe&lt;/a&gt;-like Soma called \"Megas Drepanon\", was sealed in a room beneath the statue of &lt;a href=\"Athena%20%28Saint%20Seiya%29\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; in Sanctuary. Kronos himself was damned to eternal suffering, bound by Zeus's lightning, but after thousands of years, with the seals growing weak, Kronos became able to project his will to any part of Earth in the form of a giant being with six arms. Early in the story, he proclaims &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; to be the one destined to release him, as the Leo Saint uses lightning which is able to nullify Zeus's seal, also lightning-based. His prophecy comes to pass, but he also loses his memory. While amnesiac, Kronos befriends &lt;a href=\"%23Lithos%20Chrysalis\"&gt;Lithos&lt;/a&gt; and follows her until they reach Aiolia. &lt;a href=\"%23Mnemosyne\"&gt;Mnemosyne&lt;/a&gt; then unlocks his memories and the fully restored god unleashes his evil onto the world, stopping time and engaging the Gold Saints in battle.\nHis special fighting techniques include: the , the , the , and the . He controls a giant hourglass that regulates time, the , and has three guardian planets that usually take the form of three long locks of hair. These guardians are the three most powerful &lt;a href=\"%23Giants\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt;: Nefritis Hoplisma, Elektron Ther and Margarites Drakon.\nEbony Hyperion.\nThe solar god was the first Titan to be released from Tartarus. He had been sealed inside the Egyptian sun god &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Apophis&lt;/a&gt; in ancient times and it was &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ichor\"&gt;Ichor&lt;/a&gt; that had brought him back to life. He is calm and generous to his brothers and followers. He shows a merciless face, however, when fighting an opponent or when cultivating his hatred for Zeus and other enemy gods. Like his brother and close friend &lt;a href=\"%23Dark%20Lightning%20Koios\"&gt;Koios&lt;/a&gt;, he strives not just to free Kronos, but also all of the humans who have followed the Titans since ancient times.\nHe possesses an analytical mind capable of reading through a technique he has seen only once and then developing an adequate retaliation strategy. He was also one of the first to see through Pontos and suspect his loyalty. He develops a special connection to &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; after their first fight, becoming something of a rival of the Gold Saint. He welcomes Aiolia into the Time Labyrinth and later reappears after his suspicions of Pontos are confirmed and he discovers that &lt;a href=\"%23Mnemosyne\"&gt;Mnemosyne&lt;/a&gt; has been manipulating the Titans' memories. He falls at the hands of Aiolia, to whom he entrusts his desire to protect his King and his people.\nHis Soma has the shape of a greatsword. Hyperion uses either his fists or his sword against his opponents. He has a black sun for a planet and can use the following techniques to attack: , , , , , and . Hyperion can also manipulate the air, creating blasts of high pressure that allow him to toy with an enemy's body or deflect blasts thrown at him. He can create and manipulate lava and, taking advantage of his black sun, create afterimages of his body to confuse his enemy.\nDimension Iapetos.\n was the second Titan to be released from Tartarus. He is the consort of &lt;a href=\"%23Themis\"&gt;Themis&lt;/a&gt; and the father of &lt;a href=\"%23Prometheus\"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; and Atlas. Iapetos is quick to anger, cocky and proud of his power, which he likes to show off. He is rude and sadistic, even to his siblings. This personality, however, is at odds with the deep grief and resentment he feels over the punishment the gods of Olympus gave to his son Prometheus for sharing fire with mankind. For this reason, he despises all humans, seeing them as ingrates who have forgotten the suffering of his son.\nHe is incredibly strong. He leaves the fight against &lt;a href=\"%23Aries%20Mu\"&gt;Mu&lt;/a&gt; in Jamir unscathed, without even using his full power. He later kidnaps &lt;a href=\"%23Lithos%20Chrysalis\"&gt;Lithos&lt;/a&gt; to lure &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; into the Time Labyrinth and challenges the Leo Saint alongside Themis. Consumed by thoughts of revenge against mankind, he takes the life of Themis, who willingly offers it to him so he could use her power, and declares himself a devil. The two become the first Titans to be defeated, but before throwing himself into Tartarus, Themis in his embrace, Iapetos grants his Ichor to Aiolia and &lt;a href=\"%23Virgo%20Shaka\"&gt;Shaka&lt;/a&gt;, to heal their wounds. At the end, Prometheus appears and carries his parents' bodies to &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Gaia\"&gt;Gaia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIapetos bears the double-edged sword Soma. He has exceptional control over dimensional portals, being able to use them effectively in battle with the . He is also a master of the strange ink-like substance known as , the source of the universe which he uses to conjure his most powerful attacks: , , , and . His other techniques are: the and .\nDark Lightning Koios.\n is the third Titan &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt; released from Tartarus and &lt;a href=\"%23Phoebe\"&gt;Phoebe&lt;/a&gt;'s consort. &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt; considers him his \"greatest killer\", but Koios is one of the gentlest Titans. He has a strong sense of loyalty, much like &lt;a href=\"%23Ebony%20Hyperion\"&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt;, whom he is very close to. Both give great importance to releasing their human followers. While he prefers to avoid unnecessary death, he can be lethal and merciless once the enemy decides to fight. Koios is very perceptive. He is called \"the one who understands everything\", and therefore he is the first Titan to realise Pontos's and &lt;a href=\"%23Mnemosyne\"&gt;Mnemosyne&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal to their cause and the true potential of humans.\nShortly after being reborn, he challenges &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; while the Saint guarded a meditating &lt;a href=\"%23Virgo%20Shaka\"&gt;Shaka&lt;/a&gt;. Koios held the upper hand throughout most of the fight, but in the end he had to be saved by Hyperion after Aiolia unleashed his \"Photon Burst\". The attack irrevocably injured his yet imperfect body, rendering him a mortal. He challenges Aiolia a second time in the Time Labyrinth and intentionally forces Aiolia to reach his seventh sense, to teach him how to be a perfect warrior. After his defeat, he is sucked into Tartarus, but not before giving the power of , the god-killing lightning he had devised in ancient times to end the Titanomachy, to his opponent.\nKoios is extremely fast, even for a Gold Saint and, like Aiolia, he can control and use lightning in battle. His Soma has the shape of a &lt;a href=\"rapier\"&gt;rapier&lt;/a&gt; when it is not being used. His fighting techniques are: , , , , , and .\nGalaxy Kreios.\n was one of the last Titans freed by &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"%23Dimension%20Iapetos\"&gt;Iapetos&lt;/a&gt;. He is serious in personality, but also violent. Even when furious, though, he never loses his mind, acting according to a strong sense of honour. He does not believe that gods should act solely for the benefit of humans. He sees gods as having completely free existences moved only by their all-powerful will.\nHe is highly respected by the Titans' minions, as shown by &lt;a href=\"%23Giants\"&gt;Phaios Spathe&lt;/a&gt;'s words. He attacks Sanctuary just before Kronos goes to retrieve the \"Megas Drepanon\". There, he first challenges &lt;a href=\"%23Capricorn%20Shura\"&gt;Shura&lt;/a&gt;. Shura barely manages to save his life then, only cutting Kreios's blade in half and lightly wounding him. The second time they meet is in the Time Labyrinth, after the Titan converses with his consort, &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20characters\"&gt;Eurybia&lt;/a&gt;, and states that fighting for the Titans' cause comes before everything else. He is defeated by Shura after a brutal battle and acknowledges the Saints of Athena as worthy adversaries. Before dying, he grants his &lt;a href=\"Ichor\"&gt;Ichor&lt;/a&gt; to the Capricorn Saint to heal him, and bequeaths him his sword.\nKreios's Soma has the shape of a &lt;a href=\"scimitar\"&gt;scimitar&lt;/a&gt;. and he is known for the accurate and sharp blows of his . Besides this sword, he can also use the and the . He is able to freely summon and manipulate crystals of &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum\"&gt;Orichalcum&lt;/a&gt;, the major component of the Saints' Cloths. His fighting techniques are: , , , and .\nCurrent Okeanos.\n was one of the Titans freed by &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"%23Dimension%20Iapetos\"&gt;Iapetos&lt;/a&gt;, along with Kreios and the Titanesses. He is very rational and does not let a vestige of emotion show on his face.\nHe travels to Sanctuary under the pretext of recovering &lt;a href=\"%23Galaxy%20Kreios\"&gt;Kreios&lt;/a&gt;'s broken sword and engages first &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; in battle, then &lt;a href=\"%23Aquarius%20Camus\"&gt;Camus&lt;/a&gt;. His true intentions are actually to provoke Aiolia enough that Iapetos can lure the Saint to the Time Labyrinth for the Titans to use him to restore Kronos's memory. Okeanos retains the upper hand during most of the fight. Still, he leaves before a winner is determined with a new appreciation for the power of humans.\nHis Soma has the shape of a pair of &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;. As god of the Ocean, Okeanos can control and summon water. He uses the techniques: , , , and .\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya%20Episode.G%23Drama%20CDs\"&gt;Drama CDs&lt;/a&gt;, he is voiced by &lt;a href=\"K%C5%8Dsuke%20Okano\"&gt;K\u014dsuke Okano&lt;/a&gt;.\nRhea.\n&lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt; released at the same time as the other Titanesses, Okeanos and Kreios. She is &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt;'s consort and, like the rest of the Titans, fought against the Olympian gods in the ancient Titanomachy. She is ruthless, but stoic and very loyal to Kronos. Although she has a strong desire to lead the Titans' followers to Earth, she does not have a high opinion of humans.\nAfter Kronos is released, she appears at the Statue of Athena to protect him. She attacks &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Capricorn%20Shura\"&gt;Shura&lt;/a&gt;. After returning to the Time Labyrinth and taking care of Kronos, she sends one of her monsters to open the door that connects that place to Earth so the Titans' followers may cross it, but &lt;a href=\"%23Aquarius%20Camus\"&gt;Camus&lt;/a&gt; blocks the entrance and defeats the monster. She mysteriously appears turned to stone afterwards.\nRhea's Soma has the shape of a &lt;a href=\"Katar%20%28dagger%29\"&gt;katar&lt;/a&gt;. Her powers include the ability to summon and control mythical giant beasts, like &lt;a href=\"Python%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lernaean%20Hydra\"&gt;hydras&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Salamander%20%28legendary%20creature%29\"&gt;salamanders&lt;/a&gt;. One of her summoning technique is .\nThemis.\n&lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt; released at the same time as the other Titanesses, Okeanos and Kreios. Strict in personality, she is wild and rude towards enemies. She likes to let them die slowly, not for pleasure, like her consort &lt;a href=\"%23Iapetos\"&gt;Iapetos&lt;/a&gt;, but to make them feel the power of justice. She is the mother of &lt;a href=\"%23Prometheus\"&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; and nurtures a strong desire for revenge over the punishment Zeus bestowed on her son.\nAfter protecting &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt; from Aiolia's \"Photon Burst\", Themis fights against the &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Leo Saint&lt;/a&gt; and defeats him, only to be stopped by &lt;a href=\"%23Capricorn%20Shura\"&gt;Shura&lt;/a&gt; when delivering a would-be finishing blow. She leaves her opponents under her \"Brabeus Talanton\" and does not reappear until later alongside Iapetos in the Time Labyrinth, to fight Aiolia and &lt;a href=\"%23Virgo%20Shaka\"&gt;Shaka&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, she gives her life to Iapetos so he may use her power.\nAs the embodiment of Justice, Themis can use the fighting techniques and , which crushes enemies under the weight of their sins. She judges from a god's point of view, though, so crimes against gods are especially damning. Her Soma has the shape of a &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;.\nMnemosyne.\n is one of the six Titanesses. She has a frail and childlike appearance, and she is very calm and quiet. As the one who controls memories, the other Titanesses turn to her when trying to understand why &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt; lost his memories after his release. Her Soma is shaped as an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;. Mnemosyne plays an important role as &lt;a href=\"%23Pontos\"&gt;Pontos&lt;/a&gt;'s ally. She was Zeus's consort and a traitor in the last Titanomachy who brought about the Titans' defeat by stealing &lt;a href=\"%23Dark%20Lightning%20Koios\"&gt;Koios&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Keraunos\" and giving it to Zeus. In present times, only &lt;a href=\"%23Dimension%20Iapetos\"&gt;Iapetos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Ebony%20Hyperion\"&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt; have realised that she has been manipulating the Titans' memories, weakening them so that Pontos can use them freely to fulfil his plan.\nPhoebe.\n is &lt;a href=\"%23Dark%20Lightning%20Koios\"&gt;Koios&lt;/a&gt;'s consort. Like him, she cares about the future of the Titans\u2019 mortal followers. In order to give them a better world to live in, she is willing to fight to the end on behalf of her King, &lt;a href=\"%23Kronos\"&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt;. She joins her sisters when they rush to Sanctuary to defend Kronos from Leo Aiolia\u2019s attacks, but later refrains from battling against the Gold Saints in the Time Labyrinth at Koios\u2019s request. Her Soma is shaped like a &lt;a href=\"falchion\"&gt;falchion&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheia.\n is one of the six Titanesses. Like the other Titans, she seems to be very loyal to Kronos. She fought beside him in mythological times against the Olympian gods and continues to fight for him after being revived by Pontos. Theia rushes to Sanctuary alongside her sisters when the Gold Saint Leo Aiolia threatens to destroy Kronos\u2019s body. She protects her King and helps to get him to the safety of the Time Labyrinth. Like her brothers and sisters, her memory was altered by Mnemosyne and so she remains oblivious to Pontos\u2019s traitorous plans. Her Soma has the shape of a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;.\nTethys.\n is one of the six Titanesses and consort of Okeanos. In mythological times, she and Okeanos refused to take part in the war between the Titans and the Olympian gods, but they encouraged their daughter Styx to fight on the side of the Olympians. Despite this, both of them were subjected to the same punishment as the rest of the Titans: indefinite imprisonment in Tartarus. Tethys stands with her sisters in order to protect Kronos from the Gold Saints when he is revived and afterwards helps to get him to the safety of his stronghold, the Time Labyrinth. Her memory has been altered by Mnemosyne and so she remains oblivious to Pontos's traitorous plans. Her Soma has the shape of a &lt;a href=\"sledgehammer\"&gt;sledgehammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrimordial gods.\nInitially posing as the Titans' allies, these ancient gods later reveal to have an agenda of their own: to have Gaia absorb the Titans' Dunamis in order to awaken and regain control of the Earth herself, destroying everything in the process, both humans and gods.\nPontos.\n is the primordial god of the Sea, a first generation son of &lt;a href=\"%23Gaia\"&gt;Gaia&lt;/a&gt;, the treacherous ally of the Titans and master of &lt;a href=\"%23Gemini%20Saga\"&gt;Saga&lt;/a&gt;. He is the \"master of the flow\" and so most of the time he does not intervene directly, but rather watches events unfold with the help of his cauldron and subtly directs events to fulfill his goals. He was sealed in a tomb in Egypt, near the &lt;a href=\"Aswan%20Dam\"&gt;Aswan Dam&lt;/a&gt;, but was unintentionally released by &lt;a href=\"%23Sagittarius%20Aiolos\"&gt;Aiolos&lt;/a&gt; after his Ichor escaped the weakened seal and started reviving all sorts of monsters.\nHe is a strange and cunning character, alternating between being cynical and analytical, and a frothing madman guided by pure disdain for everything except his mistress Gaia. &lt;a href=\"%23Ebony%20Hyperion\"&gt;Hyperion&lt;/a&gt; greatly distrusts him, a suspicion which is later confirmed, but nevertheless tolerates him for being the one responsible for the awakening of the Titans.\nHe fights &lt;a href=\"%23Leo%20Aiolia\"&gt;Aiolia&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance to the Time Labyrinth, completely overwhelming him, but retreats when the other Gold Saints come to aid the Leo Saint. Pontos controls water, much like Current Okeanos. His water, however, is jet-black. His greatest power is in his Dunamis, the Cosmo of the gods.

Phaios Spathe is mortally wounded by Shura's \"Excalibur\", but he is killed by &lt;a href=\"%23Galaxy%20Kreios\"&gt;Kreios&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Aster Blade\", sacrificing himself so the Titan could deliver an easy blow on the Capricorn Saint.

He faces both Aiolia and &lt;a href=\"%23Pisces%20Aphrodite\"&gt;Aphrodite&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance of the dimension of the Titans. He wields a giant ruby mace which creates blinding flashes of red and destructive waves of resonance that can disintegrate almost anything they touch. The Giant's punches also possess this power. He is defeated and killed by Aphrodite.\nThe last three Giants, , , and , are Kronos's three guardian planets that usually take the form of the three long locks of the god's hair.

Such items include postcards, pins, a coin key holder, a day planner, tarot cards, a t-shirt, puzzles, calendars, a pass case and a key chain. &lt;a href=\"Akita%20Shoten\"&gt;Akita Shoten&lt;/a&gt; has also released a bust figure of the main protagonist, Leo Aiolia.\nThe new character design of \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya%20Episode.G\"&gt;Saint Seiya Episode.G&lt;/a&gt;\" constitutes a departure from that of \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Seiya\"&gt;Saint Seiya&lt;/a&gt;\", a fact which has divided opinions. While some criticise the androgynous design, others acclaim it for its innovation. French critic Thomas Berthelon notes that Okada's depiction of the Saints \"perfectly renders the divine quality\" of these characters. At the same time, he comments that the graphical complexity of \"Episode.G\" sometimes interferes with readability and that this difficulty brought to memory \"the most beautiful pages of &lt;a href=\"Kaori%20Yuki\"&gt;Kaori Yuki&lt;/a&gt;'s manga \"&lt;a href=\"Angel%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Angel Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;\"\". Berthelon also remarks on the unoriginality of the story as, among other things, he feels the main characters are too similar in personality to the protagonists of the original series. The reviewers of Manga Sanctuary and Manga-News extend this criticism to the antagonists, saying that the Titans have little charisma and their interventions are repetitive. The reviewer from Manga-News, however, offered praise to the Titan King, Kronos, for his interesting, surprisingly childlike and unstable personality.\nAnother aspect which has received praise is Okada's exploration of the relations between Saints and regular people and how they interact with the real world, something unseen in \"Saint Seiya\". Brazilian critic Pedro Hunter highlights the inclusion of the Saints' participation in the real-life &lt;a href=\"Three%20Mile%20Island%20accident\"&gt;Three Mile Island accident&lt;/a&gt;. He says that, in the original series, the Saints \"seemed to exist apart from society and fought only in remote places.\""
