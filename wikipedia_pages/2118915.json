    "text": "Karl Shell (born May 10, 1938) is an American theoretical &lt;a href=\"economist\"&gt;economist&lt;/a&gt;, specializing in &lt;a href=\"macroeconomics\"&gt;macroeconomics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"monetary%20economics\"&gt;monetary economics&lt;/a&gt;.\nShell received an &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;A.B.&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Princeton%20University\"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; in 1960. He earned his &lt;a href=\"Ph.D.\"&gt;Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"economics\"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt; in 1965 at &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20University\"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, where he studied under &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Memorial%20Prize%20in%20Economic%20Sciences\"&gt;Nobel Prize in Economics&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Arrow\"&gt;Kenneth Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hirofumi%20Uzawa\"&gt;Hirofumi Uzawa&lt;/a&gt;.\nShell is currently &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Julius%20Thorne\"&gt;Robert Julius Thorne&lt;/a&gt; Professor of &lt;a href=\"Economics\"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Cornell%20University\"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt; (succeeding notable economist and &lt;a href=\"airline%20deregulation\"&gt;airline deregulator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20E.%20Kahn\"&gt;Alfred E. Kahn&lt;/a&gt; in the Thorne chair). He previously served on the economics faculty at &lt;a href=\"MIT\"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;.\nShell has been editor of the \"&lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Economic%20Theory\"&gt;Journal of Economic Theory&lt;/a&gt;\", generally regarded as the leading &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20scholarly%20journals%20in%20economics\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; in theoretical economics, since its inception in 1968.\nContributions to economics.\nWhile Shell has published academic articles on numerous topics in economics, he is primarily known for his contributions in three areas.\nBetween 1966 and 1973, Shell published three papers on inventive activity, &lt;a href=\"returns%20to%20scale\"&gt;increasing returns to scale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"industrial%20organization\"&gt;industrial organization&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"economic%20growth\"&gt;economic growth&lt;/a&gt;. This contribution was important in its day, and later influenced the development of \"new growth theory.\" Among others, &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Romer\"&gt;Paul Romer&lt;/a&gt; cited and heavily built upon Shell's work in his seminal papers on &lt;a href=\"endogenous%20growth%20theory\"&gt;endogenous growth theory&lt;/a&gt;.\nShell also made important contributions to the &lt;a href=\"overlapping%20generations%20model\"&gt;overlapping generations&lt;/a&gt; literature (and was perhaps the first to refer to the overlapping generations model by its modern name). The overlapping generations model is now a workhorse in modern macroeconomics and &lt;a href=\"monetary%20economics\"&gt;monetary economics&lt;/a&gt;.\nKarl Shell is also co-inventor (with &lt;a href=\"David%20Cass\"&gt;David Cass&lt;/a&gt;) of the concept of &lt;a href=\"sunspot%20equilibrium\"&gt;sunspot equilibrium&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"Sunspots%20%28economics%29\"&gt;sunspots&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Sunspot%20equilibrium\"&gt;Sunspot equilibrium&lt;/a&gt; provides a model for excess market volatility, including &lt;a href=\"bank%20runs\"&gt;bank runs&lt;/a&gt;."
