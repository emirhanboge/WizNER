    "text": "Union Park is a &lt;a href=\"municipal%20park\"&gt;municipal park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, comprising .\nLocated in the &lt;a href=\"Near%20West%20Side%2C%20Chicago\"&gt;Near West Side&lt;/a&gt;, the park is just south of &lt;a href=\"Ashland%20%28CTA%20Green%20and%20Pink%20Lines%20station%29\"&gt;Ashland/Lake station&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Line%20%28CTA%29\"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pink%20Line%20%28CTA%29\"&gt;Pink&lt;/a&gt; lines of the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20%27L%27\"&gt;Chicago 'L'&lt;/a&gt;, bordered by North Ashland Avenue on the west, &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Street%20%28Chicago%29\"&gt;West Lake Street&lt;/a&gt; on the north, the diagonal &lt;a href=\"Ogden%20Avenue\"&gt;North Ogden Avenue&lt;/a&gt; along most of the east border, and West Washington Boulevard on the south. The park has several large green fields used for demonstrations or various forms of &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, playgrounds, a swimming pool, a fieldhouse, tennis courts, baseball fields, basketball courts.\nWhile the name was chosen in 1853 in reference to the United States' &lt;a href=\"federal%20union\"&gt;federal union&lt;/a&gt;, Union Park has a considerable labor history. The surrounding neighborhood is the home of most of the city's &lt;a href=\"labor%20union\"&gt;labor union&lt;/a&gt; offices, including the &lt;a href=\"United%20Electrical%2C%20Radio%20and%20Machine%20Workers%20of%20America\"&gt;United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Teamsters\"&gt;Teamsters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LIUNA\"&gt;LIUNA&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Workers%20United\"&gt;Workers United&lt;/a&gt; Hall, and over a dozen others.\nIn the 1910s, the park was one of the only racially integrated parks in the city. In 2006, the park was the starting point for Chicago's wing of the &lt;a href=\"2006%20immigration%20reform%20protests\"&gt;2006 immigration reform protests&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Great%20American%20Boycott\"&gt;Great American Boycott&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"International%20Workers%20Day\"&gt;International Workers Day&lt;/a&gt;, which were the largest demonstrations in the history of Chicago to date. It is also the site of the annual &lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20Music%20Festival\"&gt;Pitchfork Music Festival&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Coast%20Music%20Festival\"&gt;North Coast Music Festival&lt;/a&gt;, and many other music festivals and &lt;a href=\"political%20protests\"&gt;political protests&lt;/a&gt;. In 2006, the city commissioned a statue of &lt;a href=\"James%20Connolly\"&gt;James Connolly&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Irish%20people\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Irish%20republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marxist\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; who was executed in 1916, on the south west corner."
