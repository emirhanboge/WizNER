    "text": "The French Renaissance was the &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20movement\"&gt;cultural&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Art%20movement\"&gt;artistic movement&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; between the 15th and early 17th centuries. The period is associated with the pan-European &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, a word first used by the French historian &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Michelet\"&gt;Jules Michelet&lt;/a&gt; to define the artistic and cultural \"rebirth\" of Europe.\nNotable developments during the French Renaissance include the spread of &lt;a href=\"humanism\"&gt;humanism&lt;/a&gt;, early &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Discovery\"&gt;exploration of the \"New World\"&lt;/a&gt; (as &lt;a href=\"New%20France\"&gt;New France&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20da%20Verrazzano\"&gt;Giovanni da Verrazzano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Cartier\"&gt;Jacques Cartier&lt;/a&gt;); the development of new techniques and artistic forms in the fields of printing, &lt;a href=\"French%20Renaissance%20architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;, painting, sculpture, music, the sciences and &lt;a href=\"French%20Renaissance%20literature\"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt;; and the elaboration of new codes of sociability, etiquette and discourse.\nThe French Renaissance traditionally extends from (roughly) the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Wars\"&gt;French invasion of Italy&lt;/a&gt; in 1494 during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VIII%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles VIII&lt;/a&gt; until the death of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20IV%20of%20France\"&gt;Henry IV&lt;/a&gt; in 1610. This chronology notwithstanding, certain artistic, technological or literary developments associated with the Renaissance arrived in France earlier (for example, by way of the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;Burgundy&lt;/a&gt; court or the &lt;a href=\"Avignon%20Papacy\"&gt;Papal court in Avignon&lt;/a&gt;); however, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Death\"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt; of the 14th century and the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years' War&lt;/a&gt; kept France economically and politically weak until the late 15th century.\nThe reigns of &lt;a href=\"Francis%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;Francis I of France&lt;/a&gt; (from 1515 to 1547) and his son &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20France\"&gt;Henry II&lt;/a&gt; (from 1547 to 1559) are generally considered the apex of the French Renaissance.\nThe word \"Renaissance\".\nThe word \"Renaissance\" is a &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; word, whose literal translation into English is \"Rebirth\". The term was first used and defined by French historian &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Michelet\"&gt;Jules Michelet&lt;/a&gt; (1798\u20131874) in his 1855 work \"Histoire de France\" (History of France). Jules Michelet defined the 16th-century Renaissance in France as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world. As a French citizen and historian, Michelet also claimed the Renaissance as a French movement. His work is at the origin of the use of the French word \"Renaissance\" in other languages.\nArt.\nIn the late 15th century, the French &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Wars\"&gt;invasion of Italy&lt;/a&gt; and the proximity of the vibrant &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;Burgundy&lt;/a&gt; court (with its &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flemish&lt;/a&gt; connections) brought the French into contact with the goods, paintings, and the creative spirit of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Renaissance\"&gt;Northern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Renaissance\"&gt;Italian Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, and the initial artistic changes in France were often carried out by Italian and Flemish artists, such as &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Clouet\"&gt;Jean Clouet&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Clouet\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Clouet&lt;/a&gt; and the Italians &lt;a href=\"Rosso%20Fiorentino\"&gt;Rosso Fiorentino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Primaticcio\"&gt;Francesco Primaticcio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Niccol%C3%B2%20dell%27Abbate\"&gt;Niccol\u00f2 dell'Abbate&lt;/a&gt; of the first &lt;a href=\"School%20of%20Fontainebleau\"&gt;School of Fontainebleau&lt;/a&gt; (from 1531).\nIn 1516, &lt;a href=\"Francis%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;Francis I of France&lt;/a&gt; invited &lt;a href=\"Leonardo%20da%20Vinci\"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Amboise\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise&lt;/a&gt; and provided him with the &lt;a href=\"Clos%20Luc%C3%A9\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau du Clos Luc\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, then called Ch\u00e2teau de Cloux, as a place to stay and work. Leonardo, a famous painter and inventor, arrived with three of his paintings, namely the \"&lt;a href=\"Mona%20Lisa\"&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Virgin%20and%20Child%20with%20St%20Anne%20and%20St%20John%20the%20Baptist\"&gt;Sainte Anne&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"St.%20John%20the%20Baptist%20%28Leonardo%29\"&gt;Saint Jean Baptiste&lt;/a&gt;\", today owned by the &lt;a href=\"Louvre%20museum\"&gt;Louvre museum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe art of the period from Francis I through &lt;a href=\"Henry%20IV%20of%20France\"&gt;Henry IV&lt;/a&gt; is often inspired by late Italian pictorial and sculptural developments commonly referred to as &lt;a href=\"Mannerism\"&gt;Mannerism&lt;/a&gt; (associated with &lt;a href=\"Michelangelo\"&gt;Michelangelo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parmigianino\"&gt;Parmigianino&lt;/a&gt;, among others), characterized by figures which are elongated and graceful and a reliance on visual &lt;a href=\"rhetoric\"&gt;rhetoric&lt;/a&gt;, including the elaborate use of &lt;a href=\"allegory\"&gt;allegory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mythology\"&gt;mythology&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are a number of French artists in this period including the painter &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Fouquet\"&gt;Jean Fouquet&lt;/a&gt; of Tours (who achieved realistic portraits and remarkable &lt;a href=\"illuminated%20manuscript\"&gt;illuminated manuscript&lt;/a&gt;s) and the sculptors &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Goujon\"&gt;Jean Goujon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germain%20Pilon\"&gt;Germain Pilon&lt;/a&gt;.\nLate Mannerism and early Baroque\nHenry IV invited the artists &lt;a href=\"Toussaint%20Dubreuil\"&gt;Toussaint Dubreuil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Fr%C3%A9minet\"&gt;Martin Fr\u00e9minet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambroise%20Dubois\"&gt;Ambroise Dubois&lt;/a&gt; to work on the &lt;a href=\"ch%C3%A2teau%20Fontainebleau\"&gt;ch\u00e2teau of Fontainebleau&lt;/a&gt; and they are typically called the second &lt;a href=\"School%20of%20Fontainebleau\"&gt;School of Fontainebleau&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Marie%20de%27%20Medici\"&gt;Marie de' Medici&lt;/a&gt;, Henry IV's queen, invited the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20people\"&gt;Flemish&lt;/a&gt; painter &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Paul%20Rubens\"&gt;Peter Paul Rubens&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and the artist painted a number of large-scale works for the queen's &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg%20Palace\"&gt;Luxembourg Palace&lt;/a&gt; in Paris. Another Flemish artist working for the court was &lt;a href=\"Frans%20Pourbus%20the%20younger\"&gt;Frans Pourbus the younger&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutside France, working for the dukes of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Lorraine\"&gt;Lorraine&lt;/a&gt;, one finds a very different late mannerist style in the artists &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Bellange\"&gt;Jacques Bellange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Deruet\"&gt;Claude Deruet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Callot\"&gt;Jacques Callot&lt;/a&gt;. Having little contact with the French artists of the period, they developed a heightened, extreme, and often erotic mannerism (including night scenes and nightmare images), and excellent skill in &lt;a href=\"etching\"&gt;etching&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitecture.\nOne of the greatest accomplishments of the French Renaissance was the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teaux%20of%20the%20Loire%20Valley\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire Valley&lt;/a&gt;: no longer conceived of as fortresses, these pleasure palaces took advantage of the richness of the rivers and lands of the &lt;a href=\"Loire\"&gt;Loire&lt;/a&gt; region and they show remarkable architectural skill.\nThe old &lt;a href=\"Louvre\"&gt;Louvre&lt;/a&gt; castle in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; was also rebuilt under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Lescot\"&gt;Pierre Lescot&lt;/a&gt; and would become the core of a brand new Renaissance &lt;a href=\"ch%C3%A2teau\"&gt;ch\u00e2teau&lt;/a&gt;. To the west of the Louvre, &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20de%27%20Medici\"&gt;Catherine de' Medici&lt;/a&gt; had built for her the &lt;a href=\"Tuileries\"&gt;Tuileries&lt;/a&gt; palace with extensive gardens and a &lt;a href=\"Grotto\"&gt;grotte&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ascension of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20IV%20of%20France\"&gt;Henry IV of France&lt;/a&gt; to the throne brought a period of massive urban development in &lt;a href=\"Paris%2C%20France\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, including construction on the &lt;a href=\"Pont%20Neuf\"&gt;Pont Neuf&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Place%20des%20Vosges\"&gt;Place des Vosges&lt;/a&gt; (called the \"Place Royale\"), the &lt;a href=\"Place%20Dauphine\"&gt;Place Dauphine&lt;/a&gt;, and parts of the &lt;a href=\"Louvre\"&gt;Louvre&lt;/a&gt; (amongst which the Great Gallery).\nGarden.\nFrench Renaissance gardens were characterized by symmetrical and geometric planting beds or &lt;a href=\"parterre\"&gt;parterre&lt;/a&gt;s; plants in pots; paths of gravel and sand; terraces; stairways and ramps; moving water in the form of canals, &lt;a href=\"Waterfall\"&gt;cascades&lt;/a&gt; and monumental fountains, and extensive use of artificial &lt;a href=\"Grotto\"&gt;grotte&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"labyrinth\"&gt;labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;s and statues of mythological figures. They became an extension of the chateaux that they surrounded, and were designed to illustrate the Renaissance ideals of measure and proportion.\nMusic.\n&lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;, the mostly &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;-speaking area unified with the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20France\"&gt;Kingdom of France&lt;/a&gt; in 1477, was the musical center of &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; in the early and middle 15th century. Many of the most famous musicians in Europe either came from Burgundy, or went to study with composers there; in addition there was considerable interchange between the Burgundian court musical establishment and French courts and ecclesiastical organizations in the late 15th century. The &lt;a href=\"Burgundian%20school\"&gt;Burgundian style&lt;/a&gt; gave birth to the &lt;a href=\"Franco-Flemish%20School\"&gt;Franco-Flemish style&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"polyphony\"&gt;polyphony&lt;/a&gt; which dominated European music in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. However, by the end of the 15th century, a French national character was becoming distinct in music of the French royal and aristocratic courts, as well as the major centers of &lt;a href=\"Christian%20music\"&gt;church music&lt;/a&gt;. For the most part French composers of the time shunned the sombre colors of the Franco-Flemish style and strove for clarity of line and structure, and, in secular music such as the &lt;a href=\"chanson\"&gt;chanson&lt;/a&gt;, lightness, singability, and popularity. &lt;a href=\"Guillaume%20Du%20Fay\"&gt;Guillaume Du Fay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilles%20Binchois\"&gt;Gilles Binchois&lt;/a&gt; are two notable examples from the Burgundian school during the early Renaissance period.\nThe most renowned composer in Europe, &lt;a href=\"Josquin%20des%20Prez\"&gt;Josquin des Prez&lt;/a&gt;, worked for a time in the court of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XII%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XII&lt;/a&gt;, and likely composed some of his most famous works there (his first setting of Psalm 129, \"&lt;a href=\"Psalm%20130\"&gt;De profundis&lt;/a&gt;\", was probably written for the funeral of Louis XII in 1515). Francis I, who became &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20French%20monarchs\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; that year, made the creation of an opulent musical establishment a priority. His musicians went with him on his travels, and he competed with &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20the%20Cloth%20of%20Gold\"&gt;Field of the Cloth of Gold&lt;/a&gt; in 1520 for the most magnificent musical entertainment; likely the event was directed by &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Mouton\"&gt;Jean Mouton&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most famous &lt;a href=\"motet\"&gt;motet&lt;/a&gt; composers of the early 16th century after Josquin.\nBy far the most significant contribution of France to music in the Renaissance period was the &lt;a href=\"chanson\"&gt;chanson&lt;/a&gt;. The chanson was a variety of secular song, of highly varied character, and which included some of the most overwhelmingly popular music of the 16th century: indeed many chansons were sung all over Europe. The chanson in the early 16th century was characterised by a &lt;a href=\"dactyl%20%28poetry%29\"&gt;dactyl&lt;/a&gt;ic opening (long, short-short) and &lt;a href=\"counterpoint\"&gt;contrapuntal&lt;/a&gt; style which was later adopted by the Italian &lt;a href=\"canzona\"&gt;canzona&lt;/a&gt;, the predecessor of the &lt;a href=\"sonata\"&gt;sonata&lt;/a&gt;. Typically chansons were for three or four voices, without instrumental accompaniment, but the most popular examples were inevitably made into instrumental versions as well. Famous composers of these \"Parisian\" chansons included &lt;a href=\"Claudin%20de%20Sermisy\"&gt;Claudin de Sermisy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cl%C3%A9ment%20Janequin\"&gt;Cl\u00e9ment Janequin&lt;/a&gt;. Janequin's \"La guerre\", written to celebrate the French victory at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Marignano\"&gt;Marignano&lt;/a&gt; in 1515, imitates the sounds of cannon, the cries of the wounded, and the trumpets signaling advance and retreat. A later development of the chanson was the style of \"&lt;a href=\"musique%20mesur%C3%A9e\"&gt;musique mesur\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt;\", as exemplified in the work of &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Le%20Jeune\"&gt;Claude Le Jeune&lt;/a&gt;: in this type of chanson, based on developments by the group of poets known as the &lt;a href=\"Pl%C3%A9iade\"&gt;Pl\u00e9iade&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Jean-Antoine%20de%20Ba%C3%AFf\"&gt;Jean-Antoine de Ba\u00eff&lt;/a&gt;, the musical rhythm exactly matched the stress accents of the verse, in an attempt to capture some of the rhetorical effect of music in Ancient Greece (a coincident, and apparently unrelated movement in Italy at the same time was known as the &lt;a href=\"Florentine%20Camerata\"&gt;Florentine Camerata&lt;/a&gt;). Towards the end of the 16th century the chanson was gradually replaced by the &lt;a href=\"air%20de%20cour\"&gt;air de cour&lt;/a&gt;, the most popular song type in France in the early 17th century.\nThe era of religious wars had a profound effect on music in France. Influenced by &lt;a href=\"Calvinism\"&gt;Calvinism&lt;/a&gt;, the Protestants produced a type of sacred music much different from the elaborate Latin motets written by their Catholic counterparts. Both Protestants and Catholics (especially the Protestant sympathizers among them) produced a variation of the chanson known as the \"&lt;a href=\"chanson%20spirituelle\"&gt;chanson spirituelle&lt;/a&gt;\", which was like the secular song but was fitted with a religious or moralizing text. &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Goudimel\"&gt;Claude Goudimel&lt;/a&gt;, a Protestant composer most noted for his Calvinist-inspired psalm settings, was murdered in &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Bartholomew%27s%20Day%20Massacre\"&gt;St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre&lt;/a&gt;. However, not only Protestant composers were killed during the era of conflict; in 1581, Catholic &lt;a href=\"Antoine%20de%20Bertrand\"&gt;Antoine de Bertrand&lt;/a&gt;, a prolific composer of chansons, was murdered in &lt;a href=\"Toulouse\"&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt; by a Protestant mob."
