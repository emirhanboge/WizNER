The groups believe that students, staff, and faculty would come predominantly from outside the &lt;a href=\"Chittagong%20Hill%20Tracts\"&gt;Chittagong Hill Tracts&lt;/a&gt;, and their settlement in Rangamati would change the character of the region.\nCampus.\nThe college is located in &lt;a href=\"Rangamati\"&gt;Rangamati town&lt;/a&gt;, headquarter of &lt;a href=\"Rangamati%20Hill%20District\"&gt;Rangamati Hill District&lt;/a&gt;.
