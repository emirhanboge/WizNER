In the following days, several local cases were reported to be caused by contact with two infected &lt;a href=\"Taiwanese%20people\"&gt;Taiwanese&lt;/a&gt; women who attended a wedding ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Zambales\"&gt;Zambales&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 10-year-old Filipina girl arrived the country on May 18 and was hospitalized the day after at the &lt;a href=\"Research%20Institute%20for%20Tropical%20Medicine\"&gt;Research Institute for Tropical Medicine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Muntinlupa\"&gt;Muntinlupa&lt;/a&gt;. On May 21, &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Health%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; (DOH) secretary &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Duque\"&gt;Francisco Duque&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the case being the first Philippine swine flu case.\nOn June 22, 2009, first fatality was reported, a 49-year-old female from &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Manila\"&gt;Metro Manila&lt;/a&gt;, being also the first death in Asia associated with the disease. At the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Health%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; assured that the patient did not die because of the novel virus, instead, due to &lt;a href=\"heart%20attack\"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Congress\"&gt;Philippine Congress&lt;/a&gt; learned that the woman was a regular employee of the House, and prompted the government to shut down the legislature for five days.\n&lt;a href=\"Luzon\"&gt;Luzon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlmost half of the western side of mainland &lt;a href=\"Luzon\"&gt;Luzon&lt;/a&gt; was so far not infected by the influenza virus. The northern regions, &lt;a href=\"Bicol%20Region\"&gt;Bicol Region&lt;/a&gt; and southern island of Luzon has no reported infections so far.\n&lt;a href=\"National%20Capital%20Region\"&gt;Metro Manila&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeing the location of &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Health%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;DOH&lt;/a&gt; authorized H1N1 hospital, Metro Manila reported its first influenza A(H1N1) case on May 22, 2009, in aligned with the first confirmed case in the Philippines.&gt; As the time progresses, Metro Manila has the highest number of influenza A(H1N1) cases compared to other locations on the country due to the vicinity of available hospitals to conduct respiratory swab tests. On May 18, 2009, a Filipina girl who arrived from the US was the first confirmed case of H1N1 virus in the Philippines. Health Secretary Duque said that the girl is in stable condition and is in quarantine.\nMetro Manila had its second confirmed case of Influenza A(H1N1) virus infection (as well as in the country) being a 50-year-old patient who arrived in the country from the United States on May 20, 2009 showed symptoms of the dreaded flu, including coughs and fever. The patient is currently under observation at the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Manila.\nOn June 3, 2009, a foreign exchange student in &lt;a href=\"De%20La%20Salle%20University\"&gt;De La Salle University&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed with H1N1 virus and the school was closed for ten days starting June 4. The university then became the first school in the Philippines to shut down classes due to H1N1 infection. De La Salle then recorded the highest number of flu cases in Metro Manila schools.\nOn June 4, 2009, the confirmed cases of A(H1N1) virus rose to 29, after another De La Salle-Manila student and a staff of the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Development%20Bank\"&gt;Asian Development Bank&lt;/a&gt; (ADB) were confirmed that they were infected with the virus.

Classes were suspended immediately after. Six days after, on its sister Loyola school &lt;a href=\"Ateneo%20de%20Manila%20University\"&gt;Ateneo de Manila University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quezon%20City\"&gt;Quezon City&lt;/a&gt; reported four flu infections.

The same day, nearby school &lt;a href=\"La%20Salle%20Green%20Hills\"&gt;La Salle Green Hills&lt;/a&gt; announced flu infection. &lt;a href=\"St.%20Scholastica%27s%20College\"&gt;St. Scholastica's College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; also reported infection.\n&lt;a href=\"Cordillera%20Administrative%20Region\"&gt;Cordillera Administrative Region&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Health%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;DOH&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Cordillera%20Administrative%20Region\"&gt;Cordillera&lt;/a&gt; confirmed on May 29 its first swine flu case. Similar to other flu patients, the identity and disclosure of the sick person was not publicized to promote confidentiality. A day after, on May 30, second flu patient was confirmed by the DOH Cordillera director Myrna Cabotaje, a man around his twenties. On the other hand, Baguio City Health Officer Florence Reyes said that the referral centers in the region include the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, Benguet General Hospital, Abra Provincial Hospital, Far North Luzon General Hospital and Medical Center in &lt;a href=\"Apayao\"&gt;Apayao&lt;/a&gt;, Ifugao Provincial Hospital, Kalinga Provincial Hospital, Bontoc General Hospital, and Luis Hora Memorial and Regional Hospital also in &lt;a href=\"Bontoc%2C%20Mountain%20Province\"&gt;Bontoc&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn June 18, Cordillera cases rose to six, all of whom have history of travels to the United States and other flu-infected countries. Dr. Nick Gordo assured that there is no community level outbreak so far in the region.\nMeanwhile, on June 26, 2009, Dr. Anthony Bantog, head of the &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; division of the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Agriculture%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; said that there is no &lt;a href=\"swine%20flu\"&gt;swine flu&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hog%20cholera\"&gt;hog cholera&lt;/a&gt; outbreak among Cordillera &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s, despite the rising number of cases in the region. He added, instead, that &lt;a href=\"porcine%20reproductive%20and%20respiratory%20syndrome%20virus\"&gt;porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome&lt;/a&gt; affects pigs.\nOn July 12, DOH Cordillera declared a low-level community outbreak of transmission all over Cordillera when its July 6 count of 14 rose to 47. Most of the cases came from &lt;a href=\"Baguio\"&gt;Baguio&lt;/a&gt;. On the same hand, five of Baguio's universities temporarily closed their schools when students showed influenza-like illness and symptoms: &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Louis%20University%2C%20Baguio%20City\"&gt;St. Louis University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Baguio\"&gt;University of Baguio&lt;/a&gt;, Pines City Educational College, Baguio City National High School, and St. Louis Center.\nOn July 27, 2009 afternoon, DOH Cordillera Region announced four more A(H1N1)-related deaths: an infant, a child, a woman who had just given birth and a teenager died within the past week.\n&lt;a href=\"Ilocos%20Region\"&gt;Ilocos Region&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of June 26, 2009, the only province in the region to report influenza cases is &lt;a href=\"Pangasinan\"&gt;Pangasinan&lt;/a&gt;, with two confirmed infections last June 18.\n&lt;a href=\"Cagayan%20Valley\"&gt;Cagayan Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nCagayan Valley has recorded five positive A(H1N1) cases, regional health authorities based in this city said last July 8. Most of these cases, three from Cagayan and two from Isabela.\nIn Cagayan, a seven-year-old boy in Solana town was found positive of H1N1, bringing to nine the confirmed cases in Cagayan Valley.\nFloro Orata, Department of Health-Cagayan Valley information officer, said the boy underwent swab test last week and the sample was sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Manila. He later tested positive for the virus. The boy, who was on 10-day quarantine, reportedly contracted the virus from a relative who arrived from the United States.\nContact tracing operations to his relatives showed that there are no indications that other relatives also contracted the virus. Eight of the confirmed H1N1 cases in the region were in good health now.\n&lt;a href=\"Central%20Luzon\"&gt;Central Luzon&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo date, all provinces in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Luzon\"&gt;Central Luzon&lt;/a&gt; except &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20%28province%29\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed influenza A(H1N1) cases.\n&lt;a href=\"Nueva%20Ecija\"&gt;Nueva Ecija&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround May 28\u201329, 2009, around 29 students felt &lt;a href=\"influenza-like%20illness\"&gt;influenza-like illness&lt;/a&gt;es at the same grade level in Hilera Elementary School, &lt;a href=\"barangay\"&gt;barangay&lt;/a&gt; Hilera (&lt;a href=\"Jaen%2C%20Nueva%20Ecija\"&gt;Jaen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nueva%20Ecija\"&gt;Nueva Ecija&lt;/a&gt;). Six days later, on June 5, the students under observation rose to forty, so much that Jaen mayor Santiago Austria ordered suspension of classes. He also announced that the students are all in grade six level. National Epidemiology Center director Eric Tayag, on the other hand, increased the number of cases under observation in Hilera to 57, all of which are grade six pupils and the school principal of Hilera Elementary. On June 11, 2009, &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Health%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; confirmed first case of influenza in Nueva Ecija, an 11-year-old student from the same school.\nA day after, 10 more children tested positive for the flu, nine of which are from the same school and another four-year-old toddler. Due to the fact that the first local influenza case in Central Luzon has no history of travel abroad nor close contact with the earlier cases, the DOH then speculated possible reasons how the student contracted the disease, One theory by local government of Nueva Ecija is that flu virus was transmitted by a member of a foreign medical mission, only known as \"Palanghay\" which conducted services on the school on May 31, and incubated into some students of the school. &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Daily%20Inquirer\"&gt;Philippine Daily Inquirer&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, reported that there are around 36 people quarantined (in Nueva Ecija) after they mingled and had closed contact in a wake with the 19-year-old girl tested positive for the disease; though the DOH never mentioned this possibility. Third possible theory was based on DOH Central Luzon director Rio Magpantay statement that the eleven-year-old boy possibly had flu infection during his summer vacation on the province of &lt;a href=\"Bulacan\"&gt;Bulacan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter suspecting 92 influenza cases, the Department of Health on June 14 declared community outbreak in barangay Hilera, &lt;a href=\"Jaen%2C%20Nueva%20Ecija\"&gt;Jaen, Nueva Ecija&lt;/a&gt;. The community outbreak includes the Hilera-nearby barangays of Kalabasa, Pitak, Pakul and Lambakin. The outbreak declaration created generalized stigma to Hilera residents:\n&lt;a href=\"Zambales\"&gt;Zambales&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn May 17, 2009, a wedding feast was conducted on the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Luzon\"&gt;Central Luzon&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href=\"Zambales\"&gt;Zambales&lt;/a&gt;, with the DOH-estimated number of attendees around fifty. The occasion was said to be in a beach resort in the province. Two of the wedding attendees were &lt;a href=\"Taiwanese%20people\"&gt;Taiwanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nationality\"&gt;national&lt;/a&gt;s, a mother and her daughter, were found positive of the influenza virus when upon arrival in &lt;a href=\"Taipei\"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;. In the successive, DOH tracked the location of the remaining guests through &lt;a href=\"contact%20tracing\"&gt;contact tracing&lt;/a&gt;, where they found around ten more positive for the flu.\nLater, DOH Central Luzon Director Dr. Rio Magpantay said that the total attendees were around eighty, contrary to the previously reported around 50. Other news sources claimed that it was not a wedding occasion, but a &lt;a href=\"yoga\"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; seminar instead, where around a hundred foreign nationals attended.\nOn June 28, 2009, seven &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Navy\"&gt;Philippine Navy&lt;/a&gt; soldiers were tested positive for the influenza. According to Lieutenant Colonel Edgard Arevalo upon press conference in &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Aguinaldo\"&gt;Camp Aguinaldo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quezon%20City\"&gt;Quezon City&lt;/a&gt;, these soldiers may contracted the novel disease when spending their vacation. &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20National%20Defense%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;Defense secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Teodoro%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Gilbert Teodoro, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, believes that one of the infected soldiers might have caught the virus when he attended a wedding in Zambales province, where two Taiwanese had also contracted the disease in May.\n&lt;a href=\"Calabarzon\"&gt;Calabarzon&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rizal\"&gt;Rizal&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn June 19, 2009, classes at the Karangalan Elementary School in &lt;a href=\"Cainta%2C%20Rizal\"&gt;Cainta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rizal%20province\"&gt;Rizal province&lt;/a&gt; were canceled when 43 of its students and three faculty members exhibited &lt;a href=\"influenza-like%20illness\"&gt;flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Due to this, the town government was urged to order the release of P5 million in calamity funds to be used for the purchase of &lt;a href=\"anti-flu%20vaccine\"&gt;anti-flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Surgical%20mask\"&gt;face mask&lt;/a&gt;s, alcohol, and other equipment. On June 21, swab tests of the suspected patients arrived from &lt;a href=\"Research%20Institute%20for%20Tropical%20Medicine\"&gt;Research Institute for Tropical Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, which confirmed that two of the students have influenza, thus making Cainta be the first municipality in &lt;a href=\"Rizal%20province\"&gt;Rizal province&lt;/a&gt; to report influenza case. On the same hand, Cainta mayor Ramon Ilagan cited that there were earlier cases of A(H1N1) on the town, one being a high school student from Greenland Executive Village in San Juan, and his mother who apparently caught the disease from him.\n&lt;a href=\"Quezon\"&gt;Quezon&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 7, 2009. The Maryhill College confirmed its first A(H1N1) virus case in &lt;a href=\"Lucena%2C%20Philippines\"&gt;Lucena City&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 14, 2009. 6 of 72 students that shows the symptoms of the Influenza A(H1N1) underwent the swab test and the result came out as positive.\n&lt;a href=\"Mimaropa\"&gt;Mimaropa&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo date, majority of &lt;a href=\"Mimaropa\"&gt;Mimaropa&lt;/a&gt; provinces has no confirmed infections yet.\nOn July 18, 2009, around 132 students of Managpi Elementary School in Managpi, &lt;a href=\"Calapan%20City\"&gt;Calapan City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Mindoro\"&gt;Oriental Mindoro&lt;/a&gt; mysteriously felt ill. The next day, in a radio interview with Calapan City mayor Paulino Salvador Leachon ordered schools officials of Managpu ES to temporarily close classes until July 26, where at the same day, 5 of its students were confirmed to have A(H1N1). Four days later, additional five cases were confirmed by the DOH Mimaropa Regional Director Dr. Gloria Balboa and city health officer Dr. Basilisa Llanto, two of them came from J.J. Leido National High School and three from Adriatico Elementary School. This prompted the city mayor and the council to declare suspension of classes among levels in Calapan City and to resume August 1, as more and more children acquire the disease (though no other figures provided). At the same day, all of Calapan City under &lt;a href=\"state%20of%20calamity%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;state of calamity&lt;/a&gt; as a mysterious fever downed around 400 students there.\n&lt;a href=\"Bicol%20Region\"&gt;Bicol Region&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 13, 2009, classes were suspended in &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Science%20High%20School%20Bicol%20Region%20Campus\"&gt;Philippine Science High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Goa%2C%20Camarines%20Sur\"&gt;Goa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camarines%20Sur\"&gt;Camarines Sur&lt;/a&gt; when 70 of its 300 &lt;a href=\"dorm\"&gt;dorm&lt;/a&gt;ers exhibited some &lt;a href=\"influenza-like%20illness\"&gt;influenza-like illness&lt;/a&gt;ess. Three days later, local government officials from Goa denied that an influenza A(H1N1) infected the school, but was a &lt;a href=\"seasonal%20flu\"&gt;seasonal flu&lt;/a&gt; instead. Furthermore, the toll of students infected with the seasonal flu rose to 96.\n&lt;a href=\"Visayas\"&gt;Visayas&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Visayas\"&gt;Visayas&lt;/a&gt; group islands has the most number of provinces infected in terms of geographical extent. Provinces that do not have flu cases so far include &lt;a href=\"Aklan\"&gt;Aklan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antique\"&gt;Antique&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Biliran\"&gt;Biliran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guimaras\"&gt;Guimaras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Samar\"&gt;Eastern Samar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Negros%20Oriental\"&gt;Negros Oriental&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Samar\"&gt;Northern Samar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siquijor\"&gt;Siquijor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Leyte\"&gt;Southern Leyte&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mindanao\"&gt;Mindanao&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are some parts of &lt;a href=\"Mindanao\"&gt;Mindanao&lt;/a&gt; which are affected from the virus.\n&lt;a href=\"Zamboanga%20Peninsula\"&gt;Zamboanga Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 2, 2009.
