    "text": "Blue Creek Metropark is a park and &lt;a href=\"Conservation%20Area\"&gt;conservation area&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whitehouse%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Whitehouse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Waterville%20Township%2C%20Lucas%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Waterville Township, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, owned by &lt;a href=\"Metroparks%20Toledo\"&gt;Metroparks Toledo&lt;/a&gt; and partially leased to the city of Whitehouse. \nThe rustic area has a parking lot and a one-mile loop trail leading to a wetland and a quarry pond. Fishing is permitted in the pond. A temporary restroom is located in the parking lot. \nThe park has exposed &lt;a href=\"Glacial%20striation\"&gt;glacial striations&lt;/a&gt; dating back 12,000 years, formed when glaciers pushed granite over limestone.\nHistory.\nIn the 18th century, the &lt;a href=\"Wyandot%20people\"&gt;Wyandot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ottawa%20%28tribe%29\"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chippewa\"&gt;Chippewa&lt;/a&gt; lived on the land. By the 19th century, it was being used for quarrying &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;. This was the case until &lt;a href=\"Toledo%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt; purchased the property in 1917 as the location of the Toledo House of Corrections, which was used until 1991.\nIn 2019 the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20Department%20of%20Natural%20Resources\"&gt;Ohio Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; installed a &lt;a href=\"seismometer\"&gt;seismometer&lt;/a&gt; at the park to monitor the Bowling Green Fault Line."
