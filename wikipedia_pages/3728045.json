    "text": "Paul Simon Ritchie (born 21 August 1975) is a Scottish &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; coach and former professional player. Ritchie started his playing career with &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Heart of Midlothian&lt;/a&gt; (Hearts), making 133 league appearances for the club and helping it win the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1998%20Scottish%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;. He played for several clubs after leaving Hearts during the 1999\u20132000 season. Ritchie made seven appearances for the &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland national football team&lt;/a&gt; between 1999 and 2004, scoring one goal. Since retiring as a player he has worked as a football coach, as assistant coach with &lt;a href=\"Vancouver%20Whitecaps%20FC\"&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps FC&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt; and for San Diego, the &lt;a href=\"LA%20Galaxy\"&gt;LA Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;-affiliated youth soccer club.\nCareer.\nClub.\nBeginning his career with &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Heart of Midlothian&lt;/a&gt; (Hearts) in 1992, Ritchie quickly gained a reputation as a promising &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28football%29\"&gt;defender&lt;/a&gt;, gaining a regular first team place and winning &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20under-21%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland under-21 caps&lt;/a&gt;. The highlight of his time at Hearts was undoubtedly the club's &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; win in &lt;a href=\"1997-98%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;. Persistent speculation linked him with a move to &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, particularly with his Hearts contract due to expire in &lt;a href=\"1999-00%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tynecastle%20Stadium\"&gt;Tynecastle&lt;/a&gt; club, however, were unwilling to allow him to move to a rival cheaply, and he spent time with &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; on a short term contract and appeared in both the FA Cup and League Cup Semi Finals before finally joining Rangers on a &lt;a href=\"Bosman%20ruling\"&gt;Bosman&lt;/a&gt; free transfer in June 2000.\nHowever, Rangers manager &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Advocaat\"&gt;Dick Advocaat&lt;/a&gt; then elected to sell Ritchie to &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; for a fee of \u00a3500,000 just two months later, without him ever playing a first team match for the club. Ritchie spent three years with City, but struggled throughout to earn a regular place in their team, spending time out on loan with &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%20F.C.\"&gt;Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt;. While at Portsmouth he contributed 12 appearances in the first half of the 2002\u201303 season, at the end of which they won the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Championship\"&gt;First Division Championship&lt;/a&gt; and promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;. In August 2003 he left on a free transfer and joined &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20F.C.\"&gt;Walsall&lt;/a&gt;, where despite suffering relegation he was at least able to play regular first team football again, forcing himself back into the international reckoning with some inspirational performances, scoring once against Rotherham United. However, whilst at Walsall he was caught up in a contract dispute with owner Jeff Bonser, indirectly leading to the dismissal of Saddler's manager &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Lee\"&gt;Colin Lee&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the summer of 2004 he moved on again, signing a short term contract with Dundee United, which was later extended despite injury problems limiting his appearances at first. For a while he was regularly captaining the team, but in April 2006 United manager &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Brewster\"&gt;Craig Brewster&lt;/a&gt; announced Ritchie was free to leave the club at the end of the season, despite having a year of his contract left to run. His departure was finally confirmed in August 2006. He then moved to Omonia Nicosia but left at the end of the season because of an injury to his cruciate ligament. Ritchie moved to &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee&lt;/a&gt; as youth coach in summer 2007 but left in November.\nIn 2009, Ritchie signed with &lt;a href=\"Carolina%20RailHawks\"&gt;Carolina RailHawks&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"USL%20First%20Division\"&gt;USL First Division&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. In June 2009 it was announced that Ritchie had left the club, having made just one first team appearance.\nInternational.\nRitchie represented Scotland seven times. He made his debut in a &lt;a href=\"friendly%20match\"&gt;friendly&lt;/a&gt; win against &lt;a href=\"Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; in April 1999. His next cap against the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; saw him score his only international goal. Within a year he had taken his cap total to six, but thereafter a lack of first team football at Manchester City saw him drop out of contention. He won only one more cap, against &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 following some fine displays for Walsall.\nCoaching.\nAfter his playing career ended in 2009, Ritchie returned to Britain to complete his coaching badges and work for the &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; soccer schools. He returned to Carolina RailHawks as assistant coach in 2010 and 2011 under manager &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Rennie%20%28football%20manager%29\"&gt;Martin Rennie&lt;/a&gt;. Rennie moved on to &lt;a href=\"Vancouver%20Whitecaps%20FC\"&gt;Vancouver Whitecaps FC&lt;/a&gt; in November 2011 and brought Ritchie with him as assistant coach for the &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt; club. Ritchie was released in January 2014 after Rennie was sacked.\nIn 2019 he was the youth soccer coach for San Diego, the MLS-affiliated youth soccer club of LA Galaxy.\nHonours.\nHearts"
