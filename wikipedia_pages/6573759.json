    "text": "The Golden Foot award is an international &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; award, given to players who stand out for their athletic achievements (both as individuals and team players) and for their personality. The award is only given to active players of at least 28 years of age, and can only be won once.\nTen nominees are chosen by a panel of international journalists based on the criteria that they are at least 28 years of age and still playing. Out of this list, the winner is selected by an online poll, where anyone can vote. The winner of the award leaves a permanent mould of his footprints on \"The Champions Promenade\", on the seafront of the Principality of &lt;a href=\"Monaco\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 2009, there has been a charity auction accompanying the Golden Foot event. The auction is held during the gala evening at the &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B4tel%20de%20Paris%20Monte-Carlo\"&gt;H\u00f4tel de Paris Monte-Carlo&lt;/a&gt;, and raises funds for fighting &lt;a href=\"AIDS\"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;."
