The team is the &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=\"sports%20club\"&gt;sports club&lt;/a&gt; Stade Fran\u00e7ais, whose &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Fran%C3%A7ais\"&gt;rugby union section&lt;/a&gt; is currently the most successful.\nThe team currently plays at the Haras Lupine sports center in Vaucresson (Hauts-de-Seine), in the nearby western suburbs of Paris.\nThe club has repeatedly merged with &lt;a href=\"%C3%8Ele-de-France\"&gt;\u00cele-de-France&lt;/a&gt; clubs in its history, once with the Cercle athlet\u00e9tique de Paris between 1942 and 1944 and once with the Red Star to form the Stade fran\u00e7ais-Red Star between 1948 and 1950. Stade Francais played its matches at the Paris stadium called \"Bauer stadium\" in Saint-Ouen (Seine-Saint-Denis) after the war, then at the Parc des Princes until 1968 and at the Jean-Bouin stadium in the 70s and 80s when the club evolved at professional and national levels.\nThe Stade Fran\u00e7ais experienced its heyday during the post-war period with a semi-final of the Coupe de France in 1949 under the name Stade Fran\u00e7ais-Red Star and a title of champion of France in the second division in 1952. Thereafter , the club discovered continental struggles with two participations in the Cup of Fair Cities in the 1960s (editions 1964-1965, 1965-1966).\nSince the abandonment of professionalism and high-level football in the national and regional divisions in the 1980s, the club has evolved in the lower divisions of the Hauts-de-Seine departmental football district.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1883, the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Fran%C3%A7ais\"&gt;Stade Fran\u00e7ais&lt;/a&gt; (which was also a founding member of &lt;a href=\"Union%20des%20Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9s%20Fran%C3%A7aises%20de%20Sports%20Athl%C3%A9tiques\"&gt;USFSA&lt;/a&gt;), did not have an association football section until 1900, established by \u00c9tienne Delavault. The team played at several venues, first at Becon, then at the V\u00e9lodrome de la Seine before settling down at La Faisanderie, in the Saint-Cloud area, from 1906. Stade Fran\u00e7ais took professional status in 1942 \nThe French football stadium knew its hour of glory from 1945 when the club president set up in Paris a team of professional stars, under the leadership of a legendary pair: &lt;a href=\"Larbi%20Ben%20Barek\"&gt;Larbi Ben Barek&lt;/a&gt; on the field and the mythical &lt;a href=\"Helenio%20Herrera\"&gt;Helenio Herrera&lt;/a&gt; as coach. Together they entered Division 1 in 1946 and were semi-finalists in the Coupe de France in 1949. However, the club returned to Division 2 the same year. Despite the failure of the merger with the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Red Star&lt;/a&gt; from 1948 to 1950 to form the \"Stade Fran\u00e7ais\u2013Red Star\", the club won its only trophy at today, the title of D2 champion in 1952. The club only stayed 2 years in Division 1, since in 1954, it was relegated after losing the play-offs against the neighbor of &lt;a href=\"Racing%20Club%20de%20France%20football%20Colombes%2092\"&gt;Racing&lt;/a&gt;, despite the presence in its ranks of &lt;a href=\"Dominique%20Colonna\"&gt;Dominique Colonna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kees%20Rijvers\"&gt;Kees Rijvers&lt;/a&gt;\nNowadays, the club is member of the Paris Ile-de-France Football League, where it registered in 1990. It takes part in departmental competitions but, after a long period of sports decline, the club becomes ambitious again. So in 2009, under the leadership of its new president, Jean-Pierre Pochon, Stade Fran\u00e7ais decided to return to high-level competition and set up a more dynamic organization. After repairing his two turf pitches, it simultaneously created a U19 team and a Senior team with the objective of winning titles. To mark the occasion, Stade Fran\u00e7ais aligned its teams with a brand new jersey specially made to measure and which was reminiscent of the blows from the rugby club. The French stadium goes up for the second consecutive year and is thus in the 4th division of the Hauts-de-Seine departmental football district. The objective is to set up a division each year.\nNames.\nThrough its history, the club has changed its name several times:\nNotable players.\nFrench international while playing for the club:\nManagerial history.\nSome of the most notable managers of Stade Francais have been:"
