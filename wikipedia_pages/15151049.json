    "text": "The Appetite for Construction Tour was a three-month 2007 &lt;a href=\"concert%20tour\"&gt;concert tour&lt;/a&gt; that was co-headlined by rock bands &lt;a href=\"Switchfoot\"&gt;Switchfoot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Relient%20K\"&gt;Relient K&lt;/a&gt;, with special guests &lt;a href=\"Ruth%20%28band%29\"&gt;Ruth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tour was unique in that none of the bands involved were touring to push a new album or single. They embarked on the tour to benefit &lt;a href=\"Habitat%20For%20Humanity\"&gt;Habitat For Humanity&lt;/a&gt;, and donated one dollar per ticket sold to the organization. At end of the tour, the bands had raised over $100,000 for Habitat.\nSwitchfoot frontman &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Foreman\"&gt;Jon Foreman&lt;/a&gt; also co-wrote a song with Relient K singer &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Thiessen\"&gt;Matt Thiessen&lt;/a&gt; called \"&lt;a href=\"Rebuild%20%28song%29\"&gt;Rebuild&lt;/a&gt;\" for the tour. It was released as a \"donation single\" on Switchfoot's website, with options to donate time or money to Habitat For Humanity, in exchange for the song.\nThe tour was Tour Managed by Jennifer Manning and Production Managed by Scott Cannon. It played mostly in indoor arenas or stadiums, as opposed to small rock clubs, Switchfoot's favored stomping grounds. The tour's name is a reference to \"&lt;a href=\"Appetite%20for%20Destruction\"&gt;Appetite for Destruction&lt;/a&gt;\", the debut album of American &lt;a href=\"hard%20rock\"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Guns%20N%27%20Roses\"&gt;Guns N' Roses&lt;/a&gt;.\nShow and Set list.\nRuth.\nRuth was the first band to perform at the shows, playing 4-5 songs in a half-hour-long set.\nRelient K.\nRelient K was the first of the headlining acts to perform, with their set usually lasting about an hour and a half. The &lt;a href=\"set%20list\"&gt;set list&lt;/a&gt; featured hits like \"&lt;a href=\"Be%20My%20Escape\"&gt;Be My Escape&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Who%20I%20Am%20Hates%20Who%20I%27ve%20Been\"&gt;Who I Am Hates Who I've Been&lt;/a&gt;\" from their 2004 breakthrough record, \"&lt;a href=\"Mmhmm\"&gt;Mmhmm&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as some of their older classics and newer songs. The band did not perform an &lt;a href=\"encore%20%28concert%29\"&gt;encore&lt;/a&gt;, playing all their songs in one set.\nSwitchfoot.\nSwitchfoot was the second of the two headliners to play, and their set usually lasted about an hour and a half as well. Because they were co-headlining with Relient K, many of the songs on this tour were old favorites from the band's multi-platinum \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Beautiful%20Letdown\"&gt;The Beautiful Letdown&lt;/a&gt;\", along with their singles.\nThe setlist generally consisted of the following, with minor variations in song order:\nEncore"
