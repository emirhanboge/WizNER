It is located on the western shore of the &lt;a href=\"Chef%20Menteur%20Pass\"&gt;Chef Menteur Pass&lt;/a&gt; on the northern side of &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2090\"&gt;U.S. Highway 90&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegally a part of the &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, Venetian Isles is separated from the bulk of the developed portion of the city by miles of undeveloped land. It long had the appearance of a small &lt;a href=\"fishing%20town\"&gt;fishing town&lt;/a&gt;. In the late 20th century it saw development as a &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt;an style &lt;a href=\"bedroom%20community\"&gt;bedroom community&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ruins of old &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Macomb\"&gt;Fort Macomb&lt;/a&gt; are along &lt;a href=\"Chef%20Menteur%20Pass\"&gt;Chef Menteur Pass&lt;/a&gt; at the south of the neighborhood.\nVenetian Isles was hit hard by &lt;a href=\"storm%20surge\"&gt;storm surge&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Katrina\"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. As it lies outside of the City's levee system, it experienced damage similar to that seen in &lt;a href=\"Pearlington%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Pearlington, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pass%20Christian\"&gt;Pass Christian&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormer &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%27s%202nd%20congressional%20district\"&gt;2nd District&lt;/a&gt; Congressman &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Cao\"&gt;Joseph Cao&lt;/a&gt; makes his home in Venetian Isles."
