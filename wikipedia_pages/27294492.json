    "text": "Giulio Caravatta (born March 20, 1966) is a former &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20football\"&gt;Canadian football&lt;/a&gt; quarterback who currently serves as a &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Football%20League\"&gt;Canadian Football League&lt;/a&gt; analyst on &lt;a href=\"CKST\"&gt;CKST&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rogers%20Sportsnet\"&gt;Rogers Sportsnet&lt;/a&gt;.\nA quarterback and punter at &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Fraser%20University\"&gt;Simon Fraser University&lt;/a&gt;, Caravatta signed with the &lt;a href=\"BC%20Lions\"&gt;BC Lions&lt;/a&gt; as an undrafted &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt; in 1991. He made his first start on October 21, 1995 against the &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Stallions\"&gt;Baltimore Stallions&lt;/a&gt;. Caravatta was selected by the &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20Alouettes\"&gt;Montreal Alouettes&lt;/a&gt; in a dispersal draft to provide the former &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Stallions\"&gt;Stallions&lt;/a&gt; with non-import players, but was traded back to the Lions after he refused to report to his new team. He made one start at quarterback late in the season. It would be Caravatta's last career start at quarterback and until November 8, 2015, the last start for any Canadian-born quarterback in the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Football%20League\"&gt;Canadian Football League&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Bridge\"&gt;Brandon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; started for the Montreal Alouettes. In addition to playing quarterback, Caravatta also saw time as a kicker, punter, and holder.\nCaravatta's broadcasting career began in 1999 as an analyst on the Lions' pre- and postgame shows. In 2000 he became the team's colour commentator.\nCaravatta is also a member of the West Vancouver Fire and Rescue Unit."
