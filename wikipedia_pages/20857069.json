    "title": "Phellodon",
    "text": "Phellodon is a &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"tooth%20fungi\"&gt;tooth fungi&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bankeraceae\"&gt;Bankeraceae&lt;/a&gt;. Species have small- to medium-sized &lt;a href=\"basidiocarp\"&gt;fruitbodies&lt;/a&gt; with white spines on the underside from which &lt;a href=\"spore\"&gt;spore&lt;/a&gt;s are released. All \"Phellodon\" have a short stalk or &lt;a href=\"stipe%20%28mycology%29\"&gt;stipe&lt;/a&gt;, and so the genus falls into the group known as stipitate hydnoid fungi. The tough and leathery &lt;a href=\"trama%20%28mycology%29\"&gt;flesh&lt;/a&gt; usually has a pleasant, fragrant odor, and develops a &lt;a href=\"Cork%20%28material%29\"&gt;cork&lt;/a&gt;-like texture when dry. Neighboring fruitbodies can fuse, sometimes producing large mats of joined caps. \"Phellodon\" species produce a white &lt;a href=\"spore%20print\"&gt;spore print&lt;/a&gt;, while the individual &lt;a href=\"basidiospore\"&gt;spores&lt;/a&gt; are roughly spherical to &lt;a href=\"ellipsoid\"&gt;ellipsoid&lt;/a&gt; in shape, with spiny surfaces.\nThe genus, with about 20 described species, has a distribution that includes to Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. About half of the species are found in the &lt;a href=\"southeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;southeastern United States&lt;/a&gt;, including three species added to the genus in 2013\u201314. Several \"Phellodon\" species were placed on a preliminary &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Red%20List\"&gt;Red List&lt;/a&gt; of threatened British fungi because of a general decline of the genus in Europe. Species grow in a symbiotic &lt;a href=\"mycorrhiza\"&gt;mycorrhiza&lt;/a&gt;l association with trees from the families &lt;a href=\"Fagaceae\"&gt;Fagaceae&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"beech\"&gt;beech&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;s) and &lt;a href=\"Pinaceae\"&gt;Pinaceae&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"pine\"&gt;pine&lt;/a&gt;s). Accurate DNA-based methods have been developed to determine the presence of \"Phellodon\" species in the soil, even in the extended absence of visible fruitbodies. Although \"Phellodon\" fruitbodies are considered inedible due to their fibrous flesh, the &lt;a href=\"type%20species\"&gt;type species&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Phellodon%20niger\"&gt;P.\u00a0niger&lt;/a&gt;\", is used in &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20dye\"&gt;mushroom dye&lt;/a&gt;ing.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Phellodon\" was &lt;a href=\"circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29\"&gt;circumscribed&lt;/a&gt; in 1881 by Finnish mycologist &lt;a href=\"Petter%20Karsten\"&gt;Petter Karsten&lt;/a&gt; to contain white-toothed fungi. Karsten included three species: \"&lt;a href=\"Phellodon%20cyathiformis\"&gt;P.\u00a0cyathiformis&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Phellodon%20melaleucus\"&gt;P.\u00a0melaleucus&lt;/a&gt;\", and the &lt;a href=\"type%20species\"&gt;type&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Phellodon%20niger\"&gt;P.\u00a0niger&lt;/a&gt;\" (originally published with the &lt;a href=\"botanical%20name\"&gt;epithet&lt;/a&gt; \"nigrum\"). \"P.\u00a0nigrum\" was originally described by &lt;a href=\"Elias%20Fries\"&gt;Elias Fries&lt;/a&gt; in 1815 as a species of \"&lt;a href=\"Hydnum\"&gt;Hydnum&lt;/a&gt;\". Some early authors did not consider \"Phellodon\" distinct enough to be a separate genus, and folded species assigned to this genus into \"&lt;a href=\"Hydnellum\"&gt;Hydnellum&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Hydnellum\" is &lt;a href=\"classification%20%28biology%29\"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; in the family &lt;a href=\"Bankeraceae\"&gt;Bankeraceae&lt;/a&gt;, which was circumscribed by &lt;a href=\"Marinus%20Anton%20Donk\"&gt;Marinus Anton Donk&lt;/a&gt; in 1961. Donk's original family concept included the genera \"&lt;a href=\"Bankera\"&gt;Bankera&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Phellodon\", whose species produce &lt;a href=\"hyaline\"&gt;hyaline&lt;/a&gt; (translucent) and echinulate &lt;a href=\"basidiospore\"&gt;spores&lt;/a&gt; (covered with small spines). Donk also noted that Bankeraceae species lacked &lt;a href=\"clamp%20connection\"&gt;clamp connection&lt;/a&gt;s. When clamp connections were discovered in \"Phellodon fibulatus\" and tuberculate spore ornamentation (the presence of small nodules on the spores) was found in \"P.\u00a0niger\", &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Harrison%20%28mycologist%29\"&gt;Kenneth Harrison&lt;/a&gt; thought the family Bankeraceae was superfluous, and placed \"Phellodon\" and \"Bankera\" in the family &lt;a href=\"Hydnaceae\"&gt;Hydnaceae&lt;/a&gt;. This taxonomic rearrangement was rejected by &lt;a href=\"Rudolph%20Arnold%20Maas%20Geesteranus\"&gt;Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus&lt;/a&gt; in 1974, who showed that the tuberculate spores of \"P.\u00a0niger\" were the result of an immature specimen. Richard Baird and Saeed Khan investigated spore ornamentation in North American \"Phellodon\" species using &lt;a href=\"scanning%20electron%20microscopy\"&gt;scanning electron microscopy&lt;/a&gt;, and rejected the placement of \"Phellodon\" in the Bankeraceae, preferring to leave it and \"Bankera\" in the Hydnaceae. Modern &lt;a href=\"molecular%20phylogenetic\"&gt;molecular phylogenetic&lt;/a&gt; analysis places \"Phellodon\" in the thelephoroid &lt;a href=\"clade\"&gt;clade&lt;/a&gt; (roughly equivalent to the order &lt;a href=\"Thelephorales\"&gt;Thelephorales&lt;/a&gt;) along with the related genera \"Bankera\", \"Hydnellum\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Sarcodon\"&gt;Sarcodon&lt;/a&gt;\". Although the status of the Bankeraceae has not been fully clarified with molecular genetic techniques, \"Phellodon\" is classified in this family by authorities on fungal taxonomy.\nThe generic name is derived from Greek -, meaning 'cork', and -, meaning 'tooth'. In North America, \"Phellodon\" species are &lt;a href=\"common%20name\"&gt;commonly&lt;/a&gt; known as \"cork hydnums\". The &lt;a href=\"British%20Mycological%20Society\"&gt;British Mycological Society&lt;/a&gt;, in their recommended list of common names for fungi in the United Kingdom, name \"Phellodon\" species in the form \"descriptor word\" plus \"tooth\": fused tooth (\"P.\u00a0confluens\"), grey tooth (\"P.\u00a0melaleucus\"), black tooth (\"P.\u00a0niger\"), and woolly tooth (\"P.\u00a0tomentosus\").\nDescription.\nThe &lt;a href=\"basidiocarp\"&gt;fruit bodies&lt;/a&gt; of \"Phellodon\" species have &lt;a href=\"pileus%20%28mycology%29\"&gt;caps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stipe%20%28mycology%29\"&gt;stipe&lt;/a&gt;, and thus fall into the general category of stipitate hydnoid fungi. The cap surfaces are initially velvety to &lt;a href=\"tomentose\"&gt;tomentose&lt;/a&gt;, eventually becoming matted. The surface is rough, with pits and ridges, and sometimes with &lt;a href=\"concentric\"&gt;concentric&lt;/a&gt;al zones of color or texture. The color can vary considerably, from cream to yellowish, brownish, greenish, greyish or black. Neighboring fruitbodies can fuse, forming intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20H.%20Smith\"&gt;Alexander H. Smith&lt;/a&gt; wrote of \"P.\u00a0tomentosus\", \"It often occurs in large mats of fused caps almost producing a ceiling over large areas of the moss under conifers.\" \"Phellodon\" fruitbodies can envelop nearby grass or twigs. The stipe is thickly tomentose or smooth, typically the same color as the cap or darker. In \"P.\u00a0niger\", the outer covering of the stipe is a thick felty layer of &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt; that absorbs water like a sponge. The &lt;a href=\"hymenophore\"&gt;hymenophore&lt;/a&gt; (the fertile, spore-bearing surface) is on the underside of the cap. The spines become grey at maturity. In conditions of high humidity, \"P.\u00a0niger\" can form striking drops of black liquid on the actively growing caps.\nThe fibrous &lt;a href=\"trama%20%28mycology%29\"&gt;flesh&lt;/a&gt; is single to double-layered; duplex layering results from differences in compactness or in the alignment of the constituent &lt;a href=\"hypha\"&gt;hypha&lt;/a&gt;e. Tough and leathery when fresh, the flesh develops a corklike texture when dry. In the dried state it often has an odor of &lt;a href=\"fenugreek\"&gt;fenugreek&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"curry%20powder\"&gt;curry powder&lt;/a&gt;. \"Phellodon\" species are often free of insect damage, suggesting that they may have &lt;a href=\"Plant%20defense%20against%20herbivory\"&gt;defensive chemicals&lt;/a&gt; that deter predation. Fruitbodies are not considered &lt;a href=\"edible%20mushroom\"&gt;edible&lt;/a&gt; due to their fibrous flesh.\nThe hyphal system is monomitic, containing only generative hyphae. These hyphae are not less than 6\u00a0&lt;a href=\"micrometre\"&gt;\u03bcm&lt;/a&gt; in diameter. All European species lack &lt;a href=\"clamp%20connection\"&gt;clamp connection&lt;/a&gt;s, but they are present in the North American species \"&lt;a href=\"Phellodon%20fibulatus\"&gt;P.\u00a0fibulatus&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Phellodon%20mississippiensis\"&gt;P.\u00a0mississippiensis&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"basidia\"&gt;basidia&lt;/a&gt; (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. &lt;a href=\"Cystidia\"&gt;Cystidia&lt;/a&gt; are either absent, or present infrequently as incompletely differentiated cystidioles (sterile cells about the size of an immature basidium). &lt;a href=\"Spore%20print\"&gt;In mass&lt;/a&gt;, the spores are white. &lt;a href=\"Basidiospore\"&gt;Spores&lt;/a&gt; are broadly &lt;a href=\"ellipsoid\"&gt;ellipsoid&lt;/a&gt; to roughly spherical, and echinulose (covered with small spines). They are also hyaline and &lt;a href=\"inamyloid\"&gt;inamyloid&lt;/a&gt;.\nHabitat and distribution.\nFruit bodies grow on the ground. \"Phellodon\" species, like all members of the order Thelephorales, are thought to be &lt;a href=\"mycorrhiza\"&gt;mycorrhiza&lt;/a&gt;l, forming &lt;a href=\"symbiosis\"&gt;symbiotic&lt;/a&gt; relationships with trees. Usual hosts include species from the families &lt;a href=\"Fagaceae\"&gt;Fagaceae&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"beech\"&gt;beech&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;s) and &lt;a href=\"Pinaceae\"&gt;Pinaceae&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"ectomycorrhiza\"&gt;ectomycorrhiza&lt;/a&gt;e that \"P.\u00a0niger\" forms with &lt;a href=\"Norway%20spruce\"&gt;Norway spruce&lt;/a&gt; (\"Picea abies\") has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its &lt;a href=\"chlamydospore\"&gt;chlamydospore&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Stable%20isotope%20ratio\"&gt;Stable isotope ratio&lt;/a&gt; analysis of the abundance of the stable isotope &lt;a href=\"carbon-13\"&gt;carbon-13&lt;/a&gt; shows that \"P.\u00a0niger\" has a metabolic signature close to that of &lt;a href=\"saprotrophic\"&gt;saprotrophic&lt;/a&gt; fungi, indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources other than a tree host.\nMany \"Phellodon\" species are known from the southeastern United States, where they have been extensively researched. According to Baird and colleagues, there are nine distinct \"Phellodon\" species from &lt;a href=\"Great%20Smoky%20Mountains\"&gt;Great Smoky Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding southern &lt;a href=\"Appalachian%20Mountains\"&gt;Appalachian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Three additional species from this area, \"&lt;a href=\"Phellodon%20mississippiensis\"&gt;P.\u00a0mississippiensis&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Phellodon%20brunneo-olivaceus\"&gt;P.\u00a0brunneo-olivaceus&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Phellodon%20fuligineoalbus\"&gt;P.\u00a0fuligineoalbus&lt;/a&gt;\" were added to the genus in 2013\u201314.\nConservation.\n\"Phellodon\" species, like other members of the family Bankeraceae, are sensitive to &lt;a href=\"air%20pollution\"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"soil%20pollution\"&gt;soil pollution&lt;/a&gt;, and are in general decline in western Europe. In a preliminary assessment for a &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Red%20List\"&gt;red list&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Threatened%20species\"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; British Fungi, \"P.\u00a0confluens\", \"P.\u00a0tomentosus\", and \"P.\u00a0melaleucus\" are considered &lt;a href=\"vulnerable%20species\"&gt;vulnerable&lt;/a&gt;, and \"P.\u00a0niger\" is &lt;a href=\"rare%20species\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Conservation%20biology\"&gt;Conservation&lt;/a&gt; efforts for stipitate hydnoid fungi are hampered by a dearth of information about their basic &lt;a href=\"ecology\"&gt;ecology&lt;/a&gt;, and so molecular genetic techniques are increasingly employed in attempts to better understand these fungi. In the case of \"Phellodon tomentosus\", for example, there is little correlation between fruitbody appearance and below-ground mycelium, making it hard to determine the distribution and rarity of the fungus with standard surveying techniques. \"Phellodon melaleucus\" and \"P.\u00a0niger\" were included in a Scottish study to develop species-specific &lt;a href=\"PCR\"&gt;PCR&lt;/a&gt; primers that can be used to detect the mycelia of stipitate hydnoids in soil. DNA testing of collections labelled as \"P.\u00a0melaleucus\" and \"P.\u00a0niger\" from the United Kingdom revealed additional &lt;a href=\"cryptic%20species\"&gt;cryptic species&lt;/a&gt;. PCR analysis can be used to determine the presence of a \"Phellodon\" species up to four years after the appearance of fruitbodies, allowing a more accurate determination of their possible decline and threat of extinction.\nChemistry.\n\"Phellodon\" species contain &lt;a href=\"thelephoric%20acid\"&gt;thelephoric acid&lt;/a&gt;, a metabolite of the &lt;a href=\"shikimic%20acid%20pathway\"&gt;shikimic acid pathway&lt;/a&gt;. Thelephoric acid is a &lt;a href=\"terphenyl\"&gt;terphenyl&lt;/a&gt; quinone\u2014a &lt;a href=\"1%2C4-benzoquinone\"&gt;1,4-benzoquinone&lt;/a&gt; wherein positions carbon-2 and carbon-5 are substituted with &lt;a href=\"phenyl\"&gt;phenyl&lt;/a&gt; groups. The &lt;a href=\"hirsutane\"&gt;hirsutane&lt;/a&gt; derivative phellodonic acid is found in \"P.\u00a0melaleucus\". Phellodonic acid, which exhibits &lt;a href=\"antibiotic\"&gt;antibiotic&lt;/a&gt; activity towards bacteria and other fungi, was the first &lt;a href=\"bioactive%20compound\"&gt;bioactive compound&lt;/a&gt; reported from any member of the order Thelephorales. A &lt;a href=\"total%20synthesis\"&gt;total synthesis&lt;/a&gt; was described for phellodonic acid in 2008 using \"cis\"-1,2-dihydrocatechol as the starting material. The compound &lt;a href=\"atromentin\"&gt;atromentin&lt;/a&gt; was reported to occur in fruitbodies of \"P.\u00a0melaleucus\", but this was not confirmed in a later analysis. \"P.\u00a0niger\" has been a source for several bioactive compounds: the cyathane-type &lt;a href=\"diterpenoid\"&gt;diterpenoid&lt;/a&gt;s, nigernin A and B; a nitrogenous terphenyl derivative, phellodonin; 2',3'-diacetoxy-3,4,5',6',4\"-pentahydroxy-\"p\"-terphenyl; &lt;a href=\"grifolin\"&gt;grifolin&lt;/a&gt;; and 4-\"O\"-methylgrifolic acid. \"P.\u00a0niger\" has also been used for &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20dye\"&gt;mushroom dye&lt;/a&gt;ing, in which it produces gray-blue and green colors.\nSpecies.\n\"Phellodon\" was originally circumscribed with three species. Joost Stalpers included 13 \"Phellodon\" species in his 1993 &lt;a href=\"monograph\"&gt;monograph&lt;/a&gt; on the Thelephorales. The tenth edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi (2008) indicated 16 species in the genus. , &lt;a href=\"Index%20Fungorum\"&gt;Index Fungorum&lt;/a&gt; lists 18 species of \"Phellodon\", not including the three eastern United States species added in 2013\u201314."
