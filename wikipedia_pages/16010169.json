Years later, Winston is a successful and wealthy real estate developer with a perfect and privileged family, but his life gets interrupted when his street smart, older brother Calvester finally gets out of prison and moves into the mansion since his brother owes him a favor due to an incident where Calvester took the blame for his brother's car crash.\nIt\u2019s not long before Calvester begins parading his old prison cronies through the house driving the Hill family crazy - butting heads with Winston\u2019s trophy wife Ashley (&lt;a href=\"Carrie%20Genzel\"&gt;Carrie Genzel&lt;/a&gt;); 17-year-old daughter, Heather (Marie Michel); and housekeeper Su Ho (&lt;a href=\"Emily%20Kuroda\"&gt;Emily Kuroda&lt;/a&gt;).
