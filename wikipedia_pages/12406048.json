    "text": "The National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) is a trade &lt;a href=\"voluntary%20association\"&gt;association&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;United States government&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"defense%20industrial%20base\"&gt;defense industrial base&lt;/a&gt;. It is an &lt;a href=\"501%28c%29%283%29%20organization\"&gt;501(c)3&lt;/a&gt; educational organization. Its headquarters are in &lt;a href=\"Arlington%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Arlington, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. NDIA was established in 1919 as a result of the inability of the defense industry to scale up the war effort during World War I.\nFounding.\nIn 1917, Brigadier General Benedict Crowell was called to active duty and served on the General Munitions Board. As a board member, he established a relationship with the steel industry and was almost immediately appointed Assistant &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War\"&gt;Secretary of War&lt;/a&gt; and Director of Munitions. As Director of Munitions, Crowell was a significant catalyst in improving the country's capability to produce arms and ammunition. However, he recognized the nation's need for an association that fostered cooperation between civilian industry and government in support of industrial preparedness. He founded the Army Ordnance Association (AOA) in 1919 and served as president for its first 25 years. Over the ensuing decades, AOA became the American Defense Preparedness Association (ADPA), which then merged with the 1944 National Security Industrial Association (NSIA) in 1997, creating NDIA.\nPublications.\nNDIA currently publishes \"National Defense\" Magazine, \"Weekly Policy Digest\", \"Weekly Defense Insider\", and \"Monthly Defense Watch\".\n\"National Defense\" magazine.\n\"National Defense\" has been published under a series of different titles since 1940:\nChapters.\nNDIA has 29 chapters located throughout the United States.\nDivisions.\nNDIA consists of subject-specific divisions that aim to promote defense and &lt;a href=\"national%20security\"&gt;national security&lt;/a&gt; through access, influence, and education.\nCommittees and working groups.\nNDIA has 5 industrial committees and working groups that bring government and industry personnel together on important topics."
