    "text": "G\u0142ubczyce ( or sparsely \"Glub\u010dice\", , &lt;a href=\"Silesian%20German\"&gt;Silesian German&lt;/a&gt;: \"Lischwitz\") is a town in &lt;a href=\"Opole%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Opole Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, near the border with the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;. It is the administrative seat of &lt;a href=\"G%C5%82ubczyce%20County\"&gt;G\u0142ubczyce County&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gmina%20G%C5%82ubczyce\"&gt;Gmina G\u0142ubczyce&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nG\u0142ubczyce is situated on the G\u0142ubczyce Plateau (; a part of the &lt;a href=\"Silesian%20Lowlands\"&gt;Silesian Lowlands&lt;/a&gt;) on the Psina (Cina) river, a left tributary of the &lt;a href=\"Oder%20%28river%29\"&gt;Oder&lt;/a&gt;. The town centre is located approximately south of &lt;a href=\"Opole\"&gt;Opole&lt;/a&gt; and just northwest of &lt;a href=\"Ostrava\"&gt;Ostrava&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe settlement named \"Glubcici\" was first mentioned in an 1107 deed. At the time, it was a small village, dominated by a large wooden castle. It stood on the right bank of the Psina River, which according to an 1137 peace treaty between the dukes &lt;a href=\"Sob%C4%9Bslav%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Sob\u011bslav I of Bohemia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boles%C5%82aw%20III%20Wrymouth\"&gt;Boles\u0142aw III of Poland&lt;/a&gt; formed the border between the Moravian lands (then ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Bohemian&lt;/a&gt; dukes) and the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Poland%20during%20the%20Piast%20dynasty\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Silesia\"&gt;Silesia&lt;/a&gt;. The exact date of the city foundation is unknown, but it is traceable back to 1224, when the town called \"Lubschicz\" held toll rights obtained from the &lt;a href=\"P%C5%99emyslid%20dynasty\"&gt;P\u0159emyslid&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Ottokar%20I%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Ottokar I&lt;/a&gt;. \nHowever, in 1241 the town was devastated during the &lt;a href=\"Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Mongol invasion&lt;/a&gt;. During the city's rebuilding, the left bank of the Psina was also settled, and in 1270 &lt;a href=\"Town%20privileges\"&gt;city rights&lt;/a&gt; were confirmed by King &lt;a href=\"Ottokar%20II%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Ottokar II of Bohemia&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, a wall was built around the city, complete with watchtowers and a moat. A large parish church was also constructed in the town, which had been assigned by King Ottokar II to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Hospitaller\"&gt;Order of Saint John&lt;/a&gt; in 1259. After his defeat in the 1278 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20on%20the%20Marchfeld\"&gt;Battle on the Marchfeld&lt;/a&gt;, the town privileges were acknowledged by King &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20I%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Rudolf I of Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Ottokar's widow &lt;a href=\"Kunigunda%20of%20Halych\"&gt;Kunigunda of Halych&lt;/a&gt; had a hospital erected, run by the Knights Hospitaller who established a &lt;a href=\"Commander%20%28order%29\"&gt;commandry&lt;/a&gt; here. In 1298, the town received expanded rights from King &lt;a href=\"Wenceslaus%20II%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Wenceslaus II&lt;/a&gt;. The privileges granted to the citizens were to serve as an example for other towns in the years that followed.\nFrom about 1269, Hlub\u010dice was part of the Moravian &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Opava\"&gt;Duchy of Opava&lt;/a&gt; (Troppau), ruled by a cadet branch of the Bohemian P\u0159emyslid dynasty since &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Troppau\"&gt;Nicholas I&lt;/a&gt;, a natural son of King Ottokar II, had received the lands from the hands of his father. Upon the death of Nicholas' son Duke &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Opava\"&gt;Nicholas II&lt;/a&gt; and the division of the duchy of Opava between his heirs, in 1377, the town became the residence of &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Opava\"&gt;Nicholas III&lt;/a&gt; who ruled as a &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20G%C5%82ubczyce\"&gt;Duke of G\u0142ubczyce&lt;/a&gt;. The town remained the seat of the Opava branch of the P\u0159emyslids until the last Duke &lt;a href=\"John%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Opava\"&gt;John II&lt;/a&gt; entered a &lt;a href=\"Franciscan\"&gt;Franciscan&lt;/a&gt; cloister in 1482. Upon his death three years later, his duchy was seized as a reverted fief by King &lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Corvinus\"&gt;Matthias Corvinus&lt;/a&gt; and transferred to the control of the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Krnov\"&gt;Duchy of Krnov&lt;/a&gt; (J\u00e4gerndorf, Karni\u00f3w) and the city finally lost its status as a residence.\nModern Era.\nWhile the Krnov principality was acquired by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hohenzollern\"&gt;Hohenzollern&lt;/a&gt; margrave &lt;a href=\"George%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg-Ansbach\"&gt;George of Brandenburg-Ansbach&lt;/a&gt; in 1523, the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Protestant Reformation&lt;/a&gt; reached the town. George had married &lt;a href=\"Beatrice%20de%20Frangepan\"&gt;Beatrice de Frangepan&lt;/a&gt;, the widow of Matthias Corvinus' son &lt;a href=\"John%20Corvinus\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;; he and his son &lt;a href=\"George%20Frederick%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg-Ansbach\"&gt;George Frederick&lt;/a&gt; tried to exert Hohenzollern influence in the &lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20the%20Bohemian%20Crown\"&gt;Lands of the Bohemian Crown&lt;/a&gt; which from 1526 onwards were ruled by the Catholic &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Habsburg\"&gt;House of Habsburg&lt;/a&gt;. In 1558, a &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; church and school were built in G\u0142ubczyce. In response to this, Franciscans and Jews were expelled from the city. During the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt;, the city was completely destroyed, most devastatingly by &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Empire\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; forces in 1645.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Silesian%20Wars\"&gt;Silesian Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the city came under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt; in 1743. Leobsch\u00fctz was incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Silesia\"&gt;Province of Silesia&lt;/a&gt; by 1815 and became the administrative seat of a \"&lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Landkreis&lt;/a&gt;\" (district). In the 18th century, Leobsch\u00fctz belonged to the tax inspection region of &lt;a href=\"Prudnik\"&gt;Neustadt&lt;/a&gt;. In 1781, the town's population stood at only, 2,637. In order to accommodate the city's expansion, parts of the city's wall were torn down. The population stood at 4,565 in 1825, and 9,546 in 1870. After &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Polish%20Republic\"&gt;Republic of Poland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Silesia%20plebiscite\"&gt;Silesian plebiscite&lt;/a&gt; was held in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Silesia\"&gt;Upper Silesia&lt;/a&gt;. The percentage of 99.5% of Leobsch\u00fctz citizens voted for &lt;a href=\"Weimar%20Republic\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Silesian%20Uprisings\"&gt;Silesian Uprisings&lt;/a&gt; did not directly affect the city, which had almost exclusively German-speaking inhabitants.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler%27s%20rise%20to%20power\"&gt;Nazi seizure of power&lt;/a&gt; in 1933, the town hosted schools and training grounds for both the \"&lt;a href=\"Schutzstaffel\"&gt;SS&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Sturmabteilung\"&gt;SA&lt;/a&gt;\" paramilitary forces, becoming the honorary centre of the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Party\"&gt;Nazi Party&lt;/a&gt; in the Prussian &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Upper%20Silesia\"&gt;Province of Upper Silesia&lt;/a&gt;. The town's &lt;a href=\"synagogue\"&gt;synagogue&lt;/a&gt; was burned down in 1938, the same year as &lt;a href=\"Kristallnacht\"&gt;Kristallnacht&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the Germans operated three &lt;a href=\"Forced%20labour%20under%20German%20rule%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;forced labour&lt;/a&gt; subcamps (E247, E376, E766) of the &lt;a href=\"Stalag%20VIII-B\"&gt;Stalag VIII-B/344&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"German%20prisoner-of-war%20camps%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;prisoner-of-war camp&lt;/a&gt; in the town. After the &lt;a href=\"Vistula%E2%80%93Oder%20Offensive\"&gt;Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, on 18 March 1945, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; troops began a siege of the city, which was resisted by the &lt;a href=\"18th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Panzergrenadier%20Division%20Horst%20Wessel\"&gt;18th SS Panzergrenadier Division&lt;/a&gt; (Tank grenadiers) and the 371st &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt; division. The siege ended on March 24, and the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; forces occupied the town. Approximately 40 percent of the town was destroyed in the siege or by Red Army troopers plundering in the first weeks of the occupation.\nAfter the Soviet occupation, the name of the town was changed to G\u0142ubczyce, a more modern version of its historic Polish name \"G\u0142upczyce\". The town was transferred, like most of Silesia, to the re-established &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Republic of Poland&lt;/a&gt; according to the 1945 &lt;a href=\"Potsdam%20Agreement\"&gt;Potsdam Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. Also in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement, the remaining German population was &lt;a href=\"Flight%20and%20expulsion%20of%20Germans%20from%20Poland%20during%20and%20after%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;expelled&lt;/a&gt;. New Polish settlers, some of whom refugees transferred from the &lt;a href=\"Kresy\"&gt;Kresy&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Territories%20of%20Poland%20annexed%20by%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet-annexed former Polish eastern territories&lt;/a&gt;, made the town their home. Claims to the G\u0142ubczyce territory were raised by the &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovak Republic&lt;/a&gt;, which even sent troops to the area in June 1945. The border dispute around G\u0142ubczyce was eventually settled in 1958 with the Czechoslovak-Polish border agreement. The town became the seat of a Polish county, or \"&lt;a href=\"powiat\"&gt;powiat&lt;/a&gt;\", in 1946. G\u0142ubczyce lost that distinction in 1975, but regained it in 1999.\nEconomy.\nThe town of G\u0142ubczyce's economy is based around the &lt;a href=\"Agriculture%20in%20Poland\"&gt;agricultural sector&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"food%20production\"&gt;food production&lt;/a&gt;. Formerly, during the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20People%27s%20Republic\"&gt;Polish People's Republic&lt;/a&gt;, the industry of &lt;a href=\"fibre\"&gt;fibre&lt;/a&gt; production developed in the settlement (\"Unia\", \"Piast\" manufacturers). In modern days, the fibre manufacturing industry is near non-existent. Other industries located in G\u0142ubczyce including &lt;a href=\"heating\"&gt;heating&lt;/a&gt; machinery production (\"Galmet\" and \"Electromet\").\nSports.\nThe local &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club is Polonia G\u0142ubczyce. It competes in the lower leagues.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Gmina%20G%C5%82ubczyce%23Twin%20towns%20%E2%80%93%20sister%20cities\"&gt;twin towns of Gmina G\u0142ubczyce&lt;/a&gt;."
