He was recruited by &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20football\"&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; but his academics were not up to standard so he enrolled at &lt;a href=\"Northeastern%20Oklahoma%20A%26amp%3BM%20College\"&gt;Northeast Oklahoma Junior College&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollege career.\nBlair walked onto the Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M football team and was a member of the 1969 &lt;a href=\"NJCAA%20National%20Football%20Championship\"&gt;Junior College Championship&lt;/a&gt; squad. He was able to earn a half scholarship through football but had to join the basketball team to receive his other half scholarship. Blair was recruited by &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Gators%20football\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football\"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20State%20Cyclones%20football\"&gt;Iowa State&lt;/a&gt;, among others.

He was also an exceptional special teams player, particularly in blocking punts because of his great speed and timing abilities. Blair is 3rd in NFL history with 20 blocked kicks.\nBlair appeared in two &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowls\"&gt;Super Bowls&lt;/a&gt; with the Vikings, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20IX\"&gt;Super Bowl IX&lt;/a&gt; (1974 season) and &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XI\"&gt;Super Bowl XI&lt;/a&gt; (1976 season), and both were losses respectively to the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Raiders\"&gt;Oakland Raiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlair started for the Vikings his rookie season replacing the injured &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Winston\"&gt;Roy Winston&lt;/a&gt;.

He was a vital part of the Vikings' 1976 season of 11 wins, 2 losses, and 1 tie, second in the NFL in fewest points allowed (176 points, 12.6 points per game). In particular, Blair recovered 5 &lt;a href=\"fumbles\"&gt;fumbles&lt;/a&gt; and intercepted 2 passes from his linebacker position with &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Siemon\"&gt;Jeff Siemon&lt;/a&gt; in the middle and &lt;a href=\"Wally%20Hilgenberg\"&gt;Wally Hilgenberg&lt;/a&gt; on the opposite side.
