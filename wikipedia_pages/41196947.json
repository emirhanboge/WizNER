    "text": "The California Grand Casino is a &lt;a href=\"cardroom\"&gt;cardroom&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Pacheco%2C%20California\"&gt;Pacheco, California&lt;/a&gt;. The original hotel and card room was a &lt;a href=\"Pony%20Express\"&gt;Pony Express&lt;/a&gt; stop in 1860. According to \"&lt;a href=\"Card%20Player\"&gt;Card Player&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine, the California Grand Casino is the oldest continuously operating poker room in the world, with poker games since 1854.\nA new &lt;a href=\"casino\"&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt; facility opened across the street in July 2009 with 19 gaming tables, a bar and a restaurant called The Grand Cafe. For six years in a row, the California Grand Casino was voted Best Casino in the San Francisco East Bay by the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20Area%20News%20Group\"&gt;Bay Area News Group&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the &lt;a href=\"Contra%20Costa%20Times\"&gt;Contra Costa Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20Mercury%20News\"&gt;San Jose Mercury News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Tribune\"&gt;Oakland Tribune&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nThe casino started in 1854 when the Woodford Hotel and Saloon opened its doors on what is now Pacheco Boulevard and offered alcohol, women and gambling. The hotel became a &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; and Wells Fargo &lt;a href=\"Pony%20Express\"&gt;Pony Express&lt;/a&gt; Stop in 1860. The original building bears a historical marker from the Pony Express Trail Association.\nIn 1979, Lamar \"Wil\" Wilkinson, a poker player who has made 7 final tables at the &lt;a href=\"World%20Series%20of%20Poker\"&gt;World Series of Poker&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, purchased the casino. He changed the name to the California Grand Casino, and in 2009 moved the casino into a new building.\nGames.\nThe California Grand Casino offers &lt;a href=\"Texas%20hold%20%27em\"&gt;Texas hold 'em&lt;/a&gt; poker games, Omaha poker (currently Omaha is not offered post-pandemic), and a weekly Hold Em tournament (currently there is no tournament post-pandemic). The poker games all feature three blinds, meaning that the player on the button also posts a blind bet. This leads to more players seeing the flop and more action in the games.\u00a0The Casino has a number of poker jackpots and prizes with more than $23 million in jackpots paid to players.\nThe California Grand Casino also has Hot Action Blackjack, &lt;a href=\"Baccarat%20%28card%20game%29\"&gt;Baccarat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Three%20Card%20Poker\"&gt;Three Card Poker&lt;/a&gt;, and Pai Gow Poker games. In &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, the casino does not bank the games, so these games are played with a rotating dealer position so every player has the chance to play the &lt;a href=\"Croupier\"&gt;dealer&lt;/a&gt; hand and wager against the other players, but the casino dealer still does the actual dealing and settling of all wagers."
