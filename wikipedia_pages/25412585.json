He was the publisher of the newsletter \"Herald of Freedom\" in &lt;a href=\"Zarephath%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Zarephath, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the first writers to speculate on the &lt;a href=\"Robert%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marilyn%20Monroe\"&gt;Marilyn Monroe&lt;/a&gt; trysts. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"Attorney%20general\"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;, had Capell's telephone tapped.\nBiography.\nHe was born on May 8, 1907 in &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Heights%2C%20Manhattan\"&gt;Washington Heights&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; to Anthony Capelli and Caroline Louisa Brantigam. He married in 1935 and had one daughter. He remarried in 1948 to Adele Irene Neighbor and they raised seven sons. He founded The Capell Employment Agency, which had five offices in New York City. In 1943, while an investigator for the &lt;a href=\"War%20Production%20Board\"&gt;War Production Board&lt;/a&gt;, Capell was fined $2,000 for \"agreeing to take a $1,000 gratuity from a clothing manufacturer.\" In 1964, when &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Kuchel\"&gt;Thomas Kuchel&lt;/a&gt; was campaigning against &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Goldwater\"&gt;Barry Goldwater&lt;/a&gt;, there circulated a \"vicious document\" that purported to be an affidavit signed by a &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Los Angeles Police Department&lt;/a&gt; officer saying that in 1949 he had arrested Kuchel. The document said the arrest was for drunkenness while Kuchel had been in the midst of a sex act. Capell was indicted for the libel, along with Norman H. Krause, a bar owner and ex-Los Angeles policeman, who in 1950 \"did\" arrest two people who worked in Kuchel's office for drunkenness\u00a0\u2014 &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Clemmons\"&gt;Jack Clemmons&lt;/a&gt;, a Los Angeles police sergeant until his resignation two weeks before his arrest; and John F.

He was buried in Somerset Hills Cemetery in &lt;a href=\"Basking%20Ridge%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Basking Ridge, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;."
