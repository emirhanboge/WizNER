    "text": "Ain (, ; ) is a &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Auvergne-Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes\"&gt;Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Regions%20of%20France\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; in Eastern France. Named after the &lt;a href=\"Ain%20%28river%29\"&gt;Ain&lt;/a&gt; river, it is bordered by the rivers &lt;a href=\"Sa%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Sa\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rh%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Rh\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt;. Ain is located on the country's eastern edge, on the &lt;a href=\"France%E2%80%93Switzerland%20border\"&gt;Swiss border&lt;/a&gt;, where it neighbours the cantons of &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Geneva\"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vaud\"&gt;Vaud&lt;/a&gt;. In 2016, it had a population of 638,425.\nAin is composed of four geographically different areas (&lt;a href=\"Bresse\"&gt;Bresse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dombes\"&gt;Dombes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bugey\"&gt;Bugey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pays%20de%20Gex\"&gt;Pays de Gex&lt;/a&gt;), each of which contribute to the diverse and dynamic economic development of the department. In Bresse, agriculture and agro-industry are dominated by the cultivation of cereals, cattle breeding, milk and cheese production as well as poultry farming. In Dombes, &lt;a href=\"pisciculture\"&gt;pisciculture&lt;/a&gt; assumes greater importance, as does &lt;a href=\"winemaking\"&gt;winemaking&lt;/a&gt; in Bugey.\nIn the alphabetical ordering of French departments, used for postal and demographic purposes amongst others, Ain comes first and is thus assigned the number 01 as its department number.\nAin is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Jura%20%28department%29\"&gt;Jura&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Sa%C3%B4ne-et-Loire\"&gt;Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast, &lt;a href=\"Rh%C3%B4ne%20%28department%29\"&gt;Rh\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lyon%20Metropolis\"&gt;Lyon Metropolis&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest, &lt;a href=\"Is%C3%A8re\"&gt;Is\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"Savoie\"&gt;Savoie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haute-Savoie\"&gt;Haute-Savoie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nHistory.\nThe first inhabitants settled in the territory of today's Ain about 15000 BC. The in &lt;a href=\"Simandre-sur-Suran\"&gt;Simandre-sur-Suran&lt;/a&gt; dates from the mid-&lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; era, in the fourth or third millennium BC and is the sole &lt;a href=\"menhir\"&gt;menhir&lt;/a&gt; in Burgundy. The late-second century BC &lt;a href=\"Coligny%20Calendar\"&gt;Calendar of Coligny&lt;/a&gt; bears the oldest surviving &lt;a href=\"Gaulish%20language\"&gt;Gaulish inscription&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 58 BC, &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Caesar\"&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/a&gt;'s military action against the &lt;a href=\"Helvetians\"&gt;Helvetians&lt;/a&gt;, advancing through Gaul over the territory of today's Ain, marked the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Gallic%20Wars\"&gt;Gallic Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Merovingians\"&gt;Merovingians&lt;/a&gt;, the four historic regions of the modern department belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;Kingdom of Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;. At the start of the 6th century AD, the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Belley-Ars\"&gt;diocese of Belley (\"Bellicum\")&lt;/a&gt; was created as the first bishopric in the region. Abbeys of the &lt;a href=\"order%20of%20Saint%20Benedict\"&gt;order of Saint Benedict&lt;/a&gt; were established in the valleys.\nIn 843, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Verdun\"&gt;Treaty of Verdun&lt;/a&gt; assigned the territories that comprised Ain to the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lothar%20I\"&gt;Lothar I&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Lotharingia\"&gt;Lotharingia&lt;/a&gt;). The first big &lt;a href=\"fiefdom\"&gt;fiefdom&lt;/a&gt;s (\"seigneuries\") emerged between 895 and 900 in &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A2g%C3%A9-le-Ch%C3%A2tel\"&gt;B\u00e2g\u00e9-le-Ch\u00e2tel&lt;/a&gt;, which formed the nucleus of the \"pays\" of &lt;a href=\"Bresse\"&gt;Bresse&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Coligny%2C%20Ain\"&gt;Coligny&lt;/a&gt;. Numerous castles were erected in a low rolling terrain that was not otherwise easily defended. In the 12th century, &lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20architecture\"&gt;Romanesque architecture&lt;/a&gt; flourished.\nIn the 11th century, the Counts of &lt;a href=\"Savoy\"&gt;Savoy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valromey\"&gt;Valromey&lt;/a&gt; settled in the region of Belley. In 1272, when &lt;a href=\"Sybille%20of%20B%C3%A2g%C3%A9\"&gt;Sibylle de B\u00e2g\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, sole heir, married &lt;a href=\"Amadeus%20V%2C%20Count%20of%20Savoy\"&gt;Amadeus V, Count of Savoy&lt;/a&gt;, they added &lt;a href=\"Bresse\"&gt;Bresse&lt;/a&gt; to their domains, and \u2013 by the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281355%29\"&gt;Treaties of Paris&lt;/a&gt; in 1355 \u2013 the territories of &lt;a href=\"Dauphin%C3%A9\"&gt;Dauphin\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gex%2C%20Ain\"&gt;Gex&lt;/a&gt; on the right bank of the &lt;a href=\"Rh%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Rh\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the start of the 15th century, almost the whole region of Ain was united under the &lt;a href=\"house%20of%20Savoy\"&gt;house of Savoy&lt;/a&gt;. New monasteries were founded in the cities and churches were constructed or reshaped in the &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt; style of architecture.\nAt the start of the 16th century, the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Savoy\"&gt;Duchy of Savoy&lt;/a&gt; was at the peak of its power and Ain was inherited by &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20of%20Habsburg\"&gt;Margaret of Habsburg&lt;/a&gt;, the widow of &lt;a href=\"Philibert%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Savoy\"&gt;Philibert II, Duke of Savoy&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Monastery%20of%20Brou\"&gt;Brou&lt;/a&gt;, she erected a church and a monastery in late-Gothic style. &lt;a href=\"Bourg-en-Bresse\"&gt;Bourg-en-Bresse&lt;/a&gt; became a bishop's see. After Margaret's death, &lt;a href=\"Francis%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;Francis I of France&lt;/a&gt;, a nephew of the Dukes of Savoy, claimed the Duchy for himself and conquered it in 1536. Following a treaty concluded in 1559 at Savoy, the territory of Ain was restored to the Duke of Savoy, who immediately started fortifying it. During the &lt;a href=\"Franco-Savoyard%20War%20%281600%E2%80%931601%29\"&gt;Franco-Savoyard War of 1600\u20131601&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henri%20IV%20of%20France\"&gt;Henri IV of France&lt;/a&gt; reconquered the region, although the citadel of Bourg remained impregnable. The &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Lyon%20%281601%29\"&gt;Treaty of Lyon&lt;/a&gt; of 17 January 1601 finally ended the conflict. Ain now belonged to Burgundy.\nIn the 17th century, sculpture, painting, and literature prospered. During the 18th century, streets and small industries emerged. On 28 March 1762, the &lt;a href=\"Counts%20of%20Eu\"&gt;Count of Eu&lt;/a&gt;, son of the Duke of Maine, ceded the region of &lt;a href=\"Dombes\"&gt;Dombes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XV\"&gt;Louis XV&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1790, during the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, the departments of Ain and &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9man%20%28department%29\"&gt;L\u00e9man&lt;/a&gt; were created. Ain was subdivided into nine districts, 49 cantons (now 23 cantons) and 501 communes. The Revolution did not claim many victims in the department, but it destroyed numerous valuable historical monuments. During the first &lt;a href=\"French%20Consulate\"&gt;French Consulate&lt;/a&gt; (1802), the districts were abolished. The &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; dissolved the department of L\u00e9man and assigned the arrondissement of Gex to the department of Ain.\nDuring the French Revolution and the &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;, a large number of churches were destroyed, but in 1823 the diocese of Belley was refounded. The &lt;a href=\"Cur%C3%A9%20of%20Ars\"&gt;Cur\u00e9 of Ars&lt;/a&gt; became famous. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20French%20Empire\"&gt;Second French Empire&lt;/a&gt;, numerous churches were rebuilt, agriculture changed profoundly, and the railways expanded.\nDue to its distance from the front line, the department was spared the destruction of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; (1914\u20131918). However, the majority of the vineyards could no longer be cultivated, and disappeared. Industrialization of the department began in &lt;a href=\"Oyonnax\"&gt;Oyonnax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bellegarde-sur-Valserine\"&gt;Bellegarde&lt;/a&gt;. Construction of the &lt;a href=\"Barrage%20de%20G%C3%A9nissiat\"&gt;Barrage de G\u00e9nissiat&lt;/a&gt; started in 1937.\n&lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; (1939\u20131945) vehemently struck the department of Ain and took its toll as 600 people were deported, half whom did not return. Commemorating this tragic era are: the monument of the &lt;a href=\"Maquis%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;Maquis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cerdon%2C%20Ain\"&gt;Cerdon&lt;/a&gt;, the memorial of the children of &lt;a href=\"Izieu\"&gt;Izieu&lt;/a&gt;, and the museum of the &lt;a href=\"French%20resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; and deportation in &lt;a href=\"Nantua\"&gt;Nantua&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, industrialisation of the department proceeded, favoured by an expansive road and railway network.\nGeography.\nAin is a department of geographic contrasts. In the north, the plain of &lt;a href=\"Bresse\"&gt;Bresse&lt;/a&gt; is bordered by the river &lt;a href=\"Sa%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Sa\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt; and rises slightly towards the north-east. In the south-east, the territory of &lt;a href=\"Dombes\"&gt;Dombes&lt;/a&gt; has more than a thousand ponds and lakes. In the east, the mountain chain of the southern &lt;a href=\"Jura%20mountains\"&gt;Jura&lt;/a&gt; overlooks the plain of Bresse. The busy transport axes to Italy and Switzerland crisscross the valleys. The &lt;a href=\"Gex%2C%20Ain\"&gt;Gex&lt;/a&gt; region is separated from the rest of the department by the last eastern mountain chain of the Jura where the highest elevation in the department, the &lt;a href=\"Cr%C3%AAt%20de%20la%20Neige\"&gt;Cr\u00eat de la Neige&lt;/a&gt; (1720\u00a0m), can be found. Gex belongs geographically to the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Geneva\"&gt;Lake Geneva&lt;/a&gt; basin.\nThe river Sa\u00f4ne represents the western border of the department. It is fed by three smaller rivers: the &lt;a href=\"Reyssouze%20%28river%29\"&gt;Reyssouze&lt;/a&gt; (76\u00a0km), the &lt;a href=\"Veyle\"&gt;Veyle&lt;/a&gt; (68\u00a0km) and the &lt;a href=\"Chalaronne\"&gt;Chalaronne&lt;/a&gt; (52\u00a0km). The river &lt;a href=\"Rh%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Rh\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt; forms the department's borders in the east and the south. Its main tributaries are the Suran (50\u00a0km) and notably the river Ain (190\u00a0km) which is itself fed by 118 small rivers and creeks.\nTransport networks.\nAin is situated at the crossroads of a large national and international flow of commodities and is therefore an important transit region. More than 4000\u00a0km of transport routes serve the department. In addition to a well-developed transport network of former national roads, which were transferred to the department in 2007, Ain is crisscrossed by 220\u00a0km of highway.\nFor national and international flights, the international airports of &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Lyon-Saint%20Exup%C3%A9ry%20Airport\"&gt;Saint-Exup\u00e9ry&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Geneva\"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; (Cointrin) are located within a rather short distance. The department of Ain also contains two waterways, the rivers Sa\u00f4ne and Rhone, on which building materials, such as gravel, are shipped. The most important harbour is situated in &lt;a href=\"Jassans-Riottier\"&gt;Jassans-Riottier&lt;/a&gt; on the river Sa\u00f4ne.\nLast but not least, the railway network is of great importance, in particular the &lt;a href=\"TGV\"&gt;TGV&lt;/a&gt; connections Paris-Geneva (with a stop in &lt;a href=\"Bellegarde-sur-Valserine\"&gt;Bellegarde-sur-Valserine&lt;/a&gt;) and Paris-Lyon (passing by the Sa\u00f4ne valley). A new TGV-connection through the Haut &lt;a href=\"Bugey\"&gt;Bugey&lt;/a&gt; is under construction. It will reduce travel time between Paris and Geneva by 20 minutes. The regional TER (train and bus) network is important mainly as concerns the connection to &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemographics.\nThe department of Ain is marked by very dynamic demographics. The population has grown from 471,019 inhabitants in 1990 to 515,207 in 1999 and 565,000 in 2006 (estimates of the French statistics office &lt;a href=\"INSEE\"&gt;INSEE&lt;/a&gt;). This increase is primarily due to a positive migration balance testifying to the department's attractiveness.\nThe average population density is 97 inhabitants/km2 (Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes: 136; France: 112). While the &lt;a href=\"Sa%C3%B4ne\"&gt;Sa\u00f4ne&lt;/a&gt; valley, the &lt;a href=\"C%C3%B4ti%C3%A8re\"&gt;C\u00f4ti\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bourg-en-Bresse\"&gt;Bourg-en-Bresse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gex%2C%20Ain\"&gt;Gex&lt;/a&gt; region have a high density of population, only 16 inhabitants/km2 live in the mountainous canton of &lt;a href=\"Br%C3%A9nod\"&gt;Br\u00e9nod&lt;/a&gt;.\nPopulation development since 1791:\nHigher education and research.\nSeveral colleges and research institutions are located in &lt;a href=\"Bourg-en-Bresse\"&gt;Bourg-en-Bresse&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one in &lt;a href=\"Bellignat\"&gt;Bellignat&lt;/a&gt;. In Bourg-en-Bresse, they include the Centre for University Studies, Alimentec, the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure de Plasturgie, the commercial college of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and a branch of the Lyon faculty of education. Bellignat is home of the polytechnic for plastics engineering.\nThe Centre for University Studies, which was relocated from the &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Moulin%20University%20Lyon%203\"&gt;University Jean Moulin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lyon\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; to Bourg-en-Bresse, has 540 students who pursue their studies in 6 different branches. They are: modern foreign languages, being English-German and English-Spanish; economic and social administration; business administration; and 3 levels of study in law. Law students may gain a diploma after 2 years of law study, a 'licence' after 3 years, or a Ma\u00eetrise after 4 years. This last corresponds to a master's degree in law and offers a specialization in commercial and trade law.\nAt Alimentec, altogether 700 students attend courses. Two streams of study can be followed, applied nutritional sciences or towards qualification by the commercial college of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce. The research and technology centre for applied nutritional sciences located in Bourg-en-Bresse has faculties for biology, energy sciences, informatics and biotechnology.\nAlso situated in Bourg-en-Bresse is a branch of the Lyon faculty of education, providing 450 places for future school teachers.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Bellignat\"&gt;Bellignat&lt;/a&gt;, at the heart of the 'plastics valley', a polytechnic university was founded in 1992, under the direct control of the Ministry of youth, education and research. The Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure de Plasturgie provides 140 places for future plastics engineers and utilizes a pluridisciplinary research laboratory which qualifies advanced students, notably PhD students.\nAlthough it is headquartered just across the border in &lt;a href=\"Geneva\"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt;, most of &lt;a href=\"CERN\"&gt;CERN&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Large%20Hadron%20Collider\"&gt;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/a&gt; lies in parts of several communes in the &lt;a href=\"Arrondissement%20of%20Gex\"&gt;Arrondissement of Gex&lt;/a&gt; in Ain.\nEconomy.\nGeneral data.\nWith an unemployment rate of only 5% (compared to 7% in the &lt;a href=\"Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes\"&gt;Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes&lt;/a&gt; region and 8% in France), a close-knit community of 11,500 small and medium enterprises (&lt;a href=\"Small%20and%20medium%20enterprises\"&gt;SMEs&lt;/a&gt;) and a fast-growing, export-oriented economy, mainly to Germany, Italy and Spain, Ain is one of the most dynamic regions in France.\nIndustry.\nDespite its rural image, Ain is highly industrialised. In addition to a multitude of SME's, several big enterprises of international reputation are situated in Ain, such as: Roset-Cinna, Grosfillex, Volvo, Carrier, Smoby-Berchet, CIAT, Renault Trucks, Tr\u00e9fileurope. With more than a third of all employees working in the industrial and public works sector, Ain holds 6th rank of all departments in regards to the degree of industrialisation and is the most industrialised department within the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region. The small and medium enterprises contribute most to the industrial development of the department. While enterprises with more than 500 employees represent only 27% of all industrial employment, businesses with less than 100 employees account for 47%.\nThe &lt;a href=\"plastics%20industry\"&gt;plastics industry&lt;/a&gt;, which is located mainly around the city of Oyonnax, is a highly productive branch of the economy and enjoys an excellent reputation. \"&lt;a href=\"Plastics%20Valley\"&gt;Plastics Valley&lt;/a&gt;\" comprises 10% of France's plastics industry which constitutes the highest concentration of plastics enterprises in Europe. The 349 enterprises which have been established here employ about 11,000 persons, more than a fourth of all employees of the tertiary sector (without public works). In the &lt;a href=\"Oyonnax\"&gt;Oyonnax&lt;/a&gt; basin, three of four employments are directly or indirectly depending on the plastics industry.\nThe agricultural industry, mainly located in &lt;a href=\"Bresse\"&gt;Bresse&lt;/a&gt;, accounts for more than 5,000 employees. It represents more than a fifth of the employees in the area of &lt;a href=\"Bourg-en-Bresse\"&gt;Bourg-en-Bresse&lt;/a&gt; who work in the meat industry and in tinned food factories. The pillars of the agro-industry are an efficient agriculture providing for a significant number of high quality products as well as the presence of several leading companies of this branch. The emblematic poultry industry in Bresse employs only 350 persons.\nIn 1992 the city of Bourg-en-Bresse, the department of Ain, and the local Chamber of Industry and Commerce founded the technology platform \"Alimentec\". Its tasks are, among others, applied research, technical support, technology transfer and the advanced technical education in the agro-industrial sector. The activities of Alimentec focus on three priorities: ventilation systems, plastics packing and applied hygiene.\nThe industrial fabric of Ain is also a result of its metal processing (cables, wire drawing, electrical wires) and engineering industry (automobile industry, France's most important site for truck production) as shown by the presence of several major companies in this sector (Tr\u00e9fileurope, Alcatel Cables, Renault Trucks). Foundry, metal processing and electrical industry employ approximately 8,200 workers. Due to the diversity of the activities of these industries and their dispersion over the whole department, polarisation effects similar to those in the plastics sector have not yet been observed.\nCounting more than 12,900 employees, the public works sector represents a significant share of the department's economy. About a quarter of all industry employees are working in this sector. The future development of the building sector benefits from the department's economic and demographic growth.\nThanks to its vast forests (more than a third of the department's land area), the timber industry employed (in September 2007) approximately 4,500 workers.\nThe nuclear industry represents another economic factor. The nuclear power plant in &lt;a href=\"Bugey\"&gt;Bugey&lt;/a&gt; produces about 4.2% of French electricity, employs more than 1,350 workers and secures moreover numerous employments in the enterprises of the supply chain. Every day between 300 and 1,000 external employees work in the power plant. Its importance for the local economy can not be underestimated.\nAin comprises, finally, several industrial parks. Apart from the aforementioned Plastics Valley and numerous smaller business parks which have been founded by local initiatives, the large industrial park of the plain of Ain has to be mentioned. With 700\u00a0ha, this park is forecast to become a centre for heavy industries in the &lt;a href=\"Auvergne-Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes\"&gt;Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes&lt;/a&gt; region.\nAgriculture.\nThe diversified agriculture (cattle and poultry breeding, milk and milk products, cereals, vegetables and viticulture) generates products of national and international reputation. In particular are the Bresse poultries (\"volaille de Bresse\"), blue cheese (\"Bleu\") of &lt;a href=\"Gex%2C%20Ain\"&gt;Gex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gri%C3%A8ges\"&gt;Gri\u00e8ges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bresse\"&gt;Bresse&lt;/a&gt;, carps and sturgeons of the &lt;a href=\"Dombes\"&gt;Dombes&lt;/a&gt; region as well as the wine of &lt;a href=\"Bugey\"&gt;Bugey&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe total number of farms in the department amounts to 5,170, including 2,750 full-time farms. Over the previous 25 years the number of farms has steadily diminished. While there were 14,600 farms in 1979, only 11,320 were counted in 1988 and 6,320 in 2000. The total farm land of the department amounts to 268,361\u00a0ha, containing 150,917\u00a0ha arable farm land and 118,000 plant cultures (range land, viticulture, fruit meadows, tree nurseries). The value of the department's agricultural production reached \u20ac545\u00a0million. 52% of this amount (\u20ac274\u00a0million) is allotted to animal products (cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, carp, milk) and 44% (\u20ac240\u00a0million) concern crop (cereals, oil plants, wine, vegetables, flowers).\nCommerce.\nThe commercial sector comprises 5,861 enterprises including 717 wholesalers and distributors (12.2%), 539 automobile dealers and garages as well as 1,643 retailers and repair businesses (28%) (source: Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Ain, 2006).\nWith a total of 22,973 employees and 9,000 self-employed persons, the commercial sector contributes significantly to overall employment in the department (source: Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Ain, 2006).\nMore than three-thirds of the expenses of the private households amounting to \u20ac4.4\u00a0billion per year are feeding the commercial businesses inside the department which stand their ground vis-\u00e0-vis external competition.\nServices.\nThe strongly expanding services sector represents 46.6% of all enterprises and about 55,000 employees (source: Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Ain, 2006). Since 2003, the services branch has employed more people than any other economic sector. Within the sector, services for enterprises represent 32.2% of the employees. Consulting and IT services are of growing importance. Educational services as well as health and social services are also sought after. They represent about a quarter of all employees in the services sector.\nHandcraft.\nMore than 9,000 handcraft businesses in Ain highlight the particular economic importance of this sector. The handcraft, which employs approximately 29,000 persons, has always been an essential element of the local economy. Within the sector, the production is of particular importance, followed by the construction, the services and the alimentary sector.\nTourism.\nIn economic terms, tourism in Ain means \u20ac300\u00a0million of business volume and 10,000 direct jobs as well as another 10,000 indirect employments. In December 2006, 2.9% of the department's employment was related to the tourist sector (source: Committee for Tourism in the Department of Ain, 2006).\nIn 2006, 700,000 tourists visited sites of interest in the department (museums, castles, religious monuments, gardens and caves).
