    "text": "Jennifer Rubin (born June 11, 1962) is an American &lt;a href=\"political%20commentator\"&gt;political commentator&lt;/a&gt; who writes opinion columns for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.\" Previously she worked at \"&lt;a href=\"Commentary%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Commentary&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"PJ%20Media\"&gt;PJ Media&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Human%20Events\"&gt;Human Events&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Weekly%20Standard\"&gt;The Weekly Standard&lt;/a&gt;\". Her work has been published in media outlets including \"&lt;a href=\"Politico%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Post\"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Daily%20News\"&gt;New York Daily News&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"National%20Review\"&gt;National Review&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jerusalem%20Post\"&gt;The Jerusalem Post&lt;/a&gt;\". A conservative political commentator throughout most of her career, she became a vocal critic of President &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and in September 2020, she announced that she no longer identified as a &lt;a href=\"Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2021, she became a staunch advocate of the Biden administration.\nEarly life and education.\nRubin is &lt;a href=\"American%20Jews\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; and spent her early years in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, moving with her family as a child to &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; in 1968.\nRubin earned her &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Bachelor of Arts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Doctor\"&gt;Juris Doctor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley\"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;, finishing first in her class in law school.\nCareer.\nLabor and employment law.\nBefore moving into opinion writing, Rubin was a &lt;a href=\"labor%20and%20employment%20law\"&gt;labor and employment law&lt;/a&gt;yer in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, working for &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20studio\"&gt;Hollywood studio&lt;/a&gt;s, for 20 years. She now describes herself as a \"recovering lawyer\". Commenting on working with her from 2000 to 2005, Hollywood animator and trade union leader Steve Hulett spoke to &lt;a href=\"Media%20Matters%20for%20America\"&gt;Media Matters&lt;/a&gt; \"We used to chew the fat all the time in her office and over at lunch at Caf\u00e9 del Sol near &lt;a href=\"DreamWorks%20Pictures\"&gt;Dreamworks&lt;/a&gt;. She supported &lt;a href=\"John%20Kerry\"&gt;Kerry&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 and worked closely with &lt;a href=\"Jeffrey%20Katzenberg\"&gt;Katzenberg&lt;/a&gt;, who is a big time Democratic donor. I didn't know what to think when she moved east and started blogging like mad as a conservative. I don't know if it's a marketing pose, or if she really believes it, or what.\"\nOpinion writer.\nIn 2005, she moved to &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Virginia\"&gt;Northern Virginia&lt;/a&gt; with her husband and two children. She offered a column to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Weekly%20Standard\"&gt;The Weekly Standard&lt;/a&gt;\" about &lt;a href=\"Mitt%20Romney\"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;, and continued doing freelance work for two years before joining \"&lt;a href=\"Commentary%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Commentary&lt;/a&gt;\".\nRubin's move to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" in November 2010 became a national news story and was discussed by the media on all sides of the political spectrum, ranging from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20American%20Conservative\"&gt;The American Conservative&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"The Weekly Standard\", to \"&lt;a href=\"Salon%20%28website%29\"&gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Slate%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;\". In welcoming remarks, \"The Washington Post\" editorial page editor &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Hiatt\"&gt;Fred Hiatt&lt;/a&gt; wrote, \"her provocative writing has become 'must read' material for news and policy makers and avid political watchers.\" In 2011, she was included on the list of \"50 Most Influential American Jews\" by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jewish%20Daily%20Forward\"&gt;The Jewish Daily Forward&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Slate\" blogger &lt;a href=\"David%20Weigel\"&gt;David Weigel&lt;/a&gt; called Rubin \"one of the right's most prolific online political writers\". The \"Commentary\" editor &lt;a href=\"John%20Podhoretz\"&gt;John Podhoretz&lt;/a&gt; writes of Rubin, \"She is a phenomenon, especially considering that for the first two decades of her working life, she was not a writer or a journalist but a lawyer specializing in labor issues.\"\nIn August 2013, former \"Washington Post\" &lt;a href=\"ombudsman\"&gt;ombudsman&lt;/a&gt; Patrick Pexton criticized Rubin in an open letter from his new desk at the \"&lt;a href=\"Washington%20City%20Paper\"&gt;Washington City Paper&lt;/a&gt;\", saying that he received more complaint emails about Rubin than any other \"Post\" employee. Writing that her columns were \"at best ... political pornography\", he said \"Have Fred Hiatt, your editorial page editor\u2014who I like, admire, and respect\u2014fire opinion blogger Jennifer Rubin. Not because she's conservative, but because she's just plain bad.\" Fred Hiatt, editorial page editor for the \"Post\", responded in a statement to \"Politico\", \"I appreciate Patrick's perspective but I think he is quite wrong about Jennifer Rubin. Regular readers of her blog know that she is an indefatigable reporter who is as hard on politicians on the right when she thinks they get things wrong as on the other side.\"\nPolitical views and commentaries.\nRubin was a &lt;a href=\"Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;, but she has also stated that the term has been \"ruined\" by pro-Trump conservatives and that she would \"prefer to be a 19th century liberal or a wet Tory\". She has described herself as \"a Pat Moynihan Democrat, a Scoop Jackson Democrat, an Andrew Cuomo Democrat. I'm not a Bernie Sanders Democrat.\"\nRubin has supported the &lt;a href=\"Likud\"&gt;Likud&lt;/a&gt; government in &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, and has been a critic of &lt;a href=\"Hamas\"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; and of the &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization\"&gt;Palestine Liberation Organization&lt;/a&gt; leadership. In November 2011, Rubin retweeted an anti-Hamas blog post that \"Post\" ombudsman Patrick Pexton called \"reprehensible\". Rubin later told Pexton that she endorsed and shared the views in the Post that \"expressed an understandable desire for righteous vengeance against the kidnappers and human rights abusers of &lt;a href=\"Gilad%20Shalit\"&gt;Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt;\". Pexton said, \"in agreeing with the sentiment, and in spreading it to her 7,000 Twitter followers who know her as a \"Washington Post\" blogger, Rubin did damage to the \"Post\" and the credibility that keeps it afloat.\" &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Sullivan\"&gt;Andrew Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; wrote, \"we have a blogger at the WaPo endorsing throwing Arab prisoners into the sea to meet righteous divine punishment.\" \"Post\" editorial page editor Fred Hiatt defended Rubin, saying, \"As a general matter I think it isn't wise for me to comment on the work of the ombudsman, who is entitled to his views, and over whom I do not have editorial control. However, I will say this: I think Jennifer is an excellent journalist and a relentless reporter. I think because she has strong views, and because she is as willing to take on her home team, as it were, as the visitors, she comes under more scrutiny than many and is often the target of unjustified criticism. I think she brings enormous value to the Post.\"\nIn 2011, Rubin wrote a blog post suggesting that the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Norway%20attacks\"&gt;2011 Norway attacks&lt;/a&gt; were carried out by Islamic jihadists. Columnist &lt;a href=\"James%20Fallows\"&gt;James Fallows&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Atlantic\"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;\" criticized the piece as \"rushed\" and noted the subsequent discovery that the attack was carried out by &lt;a href=\"Anders%20Behring%20Breivik\"&gt;Anders Behring Breivik&lt;/a&gt;, a native Norwegian who was not a Muslim. Another \"Atlantic\" columnist, &lt;a href=\"Jeffrey%20Goldberg\"&gt;Jeffrey Goldberg&lt;/a&gt;, responded that the criticism was unwarranted, noting that other publications such as \"&lt;a href=\"Wired%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;\" and even \"The Atlantic\" itself had printed similar speculation; Goldberg concluded: \"It is not perverse or absurd for normal people to think of al Qaeda when they hear of acts of mass terrorism. It is logical, in fact, to suspect al Qaeda.\" In a follow-up column, Rubin acknowledged that early suspicions of a jihadist attack had proven to be mistaken.\nInternational Relations scholar &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20W.%20Drezner\"&gt;Daniel W. Drezner&lt;/a&gt; has described her views on foreign policy as &lt;a href=\"neoconservative\"&gt;neoconservative&lt;/a&gt;.\nCriticism of Donald Trump.\nRubin has been one of the most vocal conservative-leaning writers to criticize &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the overall behavior of the Republican Party during Trump's term in office. Rubin denounced Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Agreement\"&gt;Paris Agreement&lt;/a&gt; as \"a dog whistle to the far right\", and designed to please his \"&lt;a href=\"climate%20change%20denial\"&gt;climate change denial&lt;/a&gt;, right-wing base that revels in scientific illiteracy.\" Previously, after &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; had approved the agreement, Rubin characterized it as \"nonsense\" and argued that it would not achieve anything. Rubin described Trump's 2017 decision to not implement parts of the &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Comprehensive%20Plan%20of%20Action\"&gt;Iran nuclear deal&lt;/a&gt; as the \"emotional temper tantrum of an unhinged president.\" She had previously said that \"if you examine the Iran deal in any detail, you will be horrified as to what is in there.\" Rubin strongly supported the United States officially recognizing &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; as Israel's capital and moving its embassy from &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aviv\"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; to Jerusalem. Early in his presidency, she criticized Trump for not doing so, saying that it was indicative of his tendency to \"never keep his word.\" She concluded that Trump \"looks buffoonish in his hasty retreat\". In December 2017, after Trump announced that he would move the embassy, she said it was \"a foreign policy move without purpose.\"\nIn a tweet referred to by &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; Media, &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Huckabee\"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt; questioned Rubin, writing: \"Jen Rubin is WAPO's excuse for conservative,\" and adding that Rubin's \"contempt for all things Trump exposes her and WAPO as &lt;a href=\"fake%20news\"&gt;fake news&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn April 2021 Rubin was declared winner of the second annual Liberal Hack Tournament, hosted by the \"Ruthless\" variety program, becoming the first woman to win the title.\nDomestic policy views.\n&lt;a href=\"Conor%20Friedersdorf\"&gt;Conor Friedersdorf&lt;/a&gt; of \"The Atlantic\" argued that after the 2012 presidential election, Rubin criticized aspects of the &lt;a href=\"Mitt%20Romney\"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; campaign that she had previously praised, with Friedersdorf insisting that she had acted as \"a disingenuous mouthpiece for her favored candidate\".\nIn a November 21, 2013, column, Rubin called on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Organization%20for%20Marriage\"&gt;National Organization for Marriage&lt;/a&gt; (NOM) to end its campaign against same-sex marriage.\nPersonal life.\nRubin and her husband, Jonathan, have two sons. The couple moved to &lt;a href=\"Oakton%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Oakton, Virginia&lt;/a&gt; from Los Angeles in 2005."
