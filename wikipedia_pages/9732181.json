    "text": "Tom Biggs (born 22 August 1984) is an English former &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; footballer, most recently he played for &lt;a href=\"Worcester%20Warriors\"&gt;Worcester Warriors&lt;/a&gt;. His usual position was at &lt;a href=\"Wing%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;wing&lt;/a&gt;. Biggs featured in the &lt;a href=\"Zurich%20Premiership\"&gt;Zurich Premiership&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Powergen%20Cup\"&gt;Powergen Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20Rugby%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt;. He has a twin brother\nBiggs had not played any club rugby before joining the Yorkshire U18s, having only played with his school team at &lt;a href=\"Hymers%20College\"&gt;Hymers College&lt;/a&gt;. Biggs was spotted by the then Tykes Academy boss &lt;a href=\"Stuart%20Lancaster%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;Stuart Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; and was asked to join the Tykes' Academy side.\nBefore the 2004\u201305 &lt;a href=\"Zurich%20Premiership\"&gt;Zurich Premiership&lt;/a&gt; season, Biggs was considering a part-time rugby career with &lt;a href=\"National%20Division%20Two\"&gt;National Division Two&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"Harrogate%20RUFC\"&gt;Harrogate&lt;/a&gt;, having failed to make an appearance in the &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Tykes\"&gt;Leeds Tykes&lt;/a&gt; first team. At the time, he was working in a cinema and in a pea factory to supplement his life as a business student at &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Metropolitan%20University\"&gt;Leeds Metropolitan University&lt;/a&gt;, but by the end of the season he had collected a &lt;a href=\"Powergen%20Cup\"&gt;Powergen Cup&lt;/a&gt; winners medal.\nHe had been recalled by Tykes coach &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Davies\"&gt;Phil Davies&lt;/a&gt; on the eve of the season as the club were forced to call on all their resources when faced with an injury crisis with &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Christophers\"&gt;Phil Christophers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Albanese\"&gt;Diego Albanese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Stimpson\"&gt;Tim Stimpson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iain%20Balshaw\"&gt;Iain Balshaw&lt;/a&gt; all unable to play. Biggs was included in the pre-season warm up games and was picked in the starting line up for the opening game of the season against &lt;a href=\"Gloucester%20Rugby\"&gt;Gloucester Rugby&lt;/a&gt; on 5 September 2004, making his full debut in a 16\u201321 defeat at &lt;a href=\"Headingley\"&gt;Headingley&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiggs also featured in the next game against &lt;a href=\"Leicester%20Tigers\"&gt;Leicester Tigers&lt;/a&gt;, scoring a try in a 20\u201342 defeat. He was first to react to a &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Ross%20%28rugby%20player%29\"&gt;Gordon Ross&lt;/a&gt; cross field kick and chipped on ahead of &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Healey\"&gt;Austin Healey&lt;/a&gt; to collect the ball and evade the cover tackle to touch down. The try was later short-listed for the &lt;a href=\"Gillette%20%28brand%29\"&gt;Gillette&lt;/a&gt; Try of the season at the &lt;a href=\"Zurich%20Awards\"&gt;Zurich Awards&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiggs made a total of 21 appearances in the 2004\u201305 season, helping the Tykes to avoid relegation from the Zurich Premiership with another try against Leicester in a 23\u201322 victory at Headingley. He ended his debut season with a place in the Tykes' Powergen Cup final against &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Rugby\"&gt;Bath Rugby&lt;/a&gt;, collecting his first winners medal in a 20\u201312 win. He was chosen ahead of &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; wing &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Albanese\"&gt;Diego Albanese&lt;/a&gt; in the Tykes' side for the &lt;a href=\"Twickenham%20Stadium\"&gt;Twickenham&lt;/a&gt; clash.\nAfter his first season, he was selected for the England team in the &lt;a href=\"International%20Rugby%20Board\"&gt;IRB&lt;/a&gt; U21s Championship in Argentina and was involved in the U21s' &lt;a href=\"Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;Six Nations&lt;/a&gt; campaign, playing in their final clash with &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. He ended last season as the club's top try scorer and was voted Player of the Year.\nBiggs, who was close to being selected for the &lt;a href=\"England%20Saxons\"&gt;England Saxons&lt;/a&gt; last summer, committed himself to the Tykes until 2009. He missed three months of the National Division One 2006/7 season, following a shoulder surgery that he suffered in September 2006. He had an operation to repair torn cartilage and a ligament, but returned to action in January 2007 as a replacement against Nottingham.\nBiggs moved to the &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20Falcons\"&gt;Newcastle Falcons&lt;/a&gt; on a one-year contract for the 2009\u201310 season. He was also called into the &lt;a href=\"England%20Saxons\"&gt;England Saxons&lt;/a&gt; squad to face &lt;a href=\"Italy%20A%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Italy A&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ragusa%2C%20Italy\"&gt;Ragusa&lt;/a&gt;, Sicily on 9 February 2008. On 17 February 2010, it was announced that Biggs had signed a three-year deal to play for Bath.\nOn 10 October 2013, Biggs was set for a cross-code switch to &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; to join &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt;. But on 4 April 2014, Hull F.C. announced they called off the deal to sign Tom Biggs. Instead, Biggs signed for local rivals &lt;a href=\"Worcester%20Warriors\"&gt;Worcester Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, who compete in the &lt;a href=\"RFU%20Championship\"&gt;RFU Championship&lt;/a&gt; from the 2014\u201315 season.\nOn 16 October 2017 Biggs announced his retirement from rugby on medical advice."
