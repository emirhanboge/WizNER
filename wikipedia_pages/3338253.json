    "text": "WOKY (920 &lt;a href=\"Hertz\"&gt;kHz&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Big 920\") is a commercial &lt;a href=\"AM%20radio\"&gt;AM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"radio%20station\"&gt;radio station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, United States. It is owned and operated by &lt;a href=\"iHeartMedia\"&gt;iHeartMedia&lt;/a&gt; and broadcasts a &lt;a href=\"sports%20radio\"&gt;sports&lt;/a&gt; format affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Sports%20Radio\"&gt;Fox Sports Radio&lt;/a&gt;. Its studios and offices, which became the home of all iHeart Milwaukee stations in 2000 after a building expansion, are located on West Howard Avenue in suburban &lt;a href=\"Greenfield%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Greenfield&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"transmitter\"&gt;transmitter&lt;/a&gt; site is behind the studios. WOKY broadcasts in &lt;a href=\"HD%20Radio\"&gt;HD Radio&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe history of WOKY can be traced back to WEXT, a 1,000-watt &lt;a href=\"daytimer\"&gt;daytimer&lt;/a&gt; radio station at 1430 &lt;a href=\"kilocycle\"&gt;kilocycle&lt;/a&gt;s in Milwaukee. It was founded by what would become the &lt;a href=\"Bartell%20Group\"&gt;Bartell Group&lt;/a&gt;: Lee, David, Gerald, and Rosa Bartell (later Evans) which began operations on August 31, 1947. WEXT, the Milwaukee market's fifth radio station, did fairly well with a broadcast schedule that included popular music and ethnic programming, including a &lt;a href=\"polka%20music\"&gt;polka music&lt;/a&gt; show hosted by local radio legend John Reddy. Gerald Bartell and Rosa Bartell met Ralph Evans II while the three worked at the student radio station of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison\"&gt;University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison&lt;/a&gt;. Gerald and Rosa worked on programming and Evans was an electrical engineering student.\nIn the wake of WEXT's success, the Bartell family applied for full-time broadcast operations, and the result was a move down the dial to AM 920 on September 1950 and a new &lt;a href=\"call%20sign\"&gt;call sign&lt;/a&gt;, WOKY. (The 1430 frequency was reassigned in 1951 to &lt;a href=\"WBEV\"&gt;WBEV&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Beaver%20Dam%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Beaver Dam, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, 50 miles northwest of Milwaukee.) WOKY initially aired a &lt;a href=\"full%20service%20%28radio%20format%29\"&gt;full-service&lt;/a&gt; variety format similar to WEXT's, including popular music shows and programs oriented toward housewives and children. In time, pop music became the primary component of WOKY's schedule, with &lt;a href=\"disc%20jockey\"&gt;disc jockey&lt;/a&gt;s choosing the songs they played based on the \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20magazine\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Cash%20Box%20magazine\"&gt;Cash Box&lt;/a&gt;\" best-seller charts and on local record sales. WOKY soon became Milwaukee's second &lt;a href=\"contemporary%20hit%20radio\"&gt;Top 40&lt;/a&gt; music station after WRIT (now &lt;a href=\"WJOI\"&gt;WJOI&lt;/a&gt;).\nWOKY served as the city's premier Top 40 station during most of the 1960s and 1970s, and was known for much of that time as the \"Mighty 92.\" Along with &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; Top 40 giants &lt;a href=\"WLS%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WLS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"WMVP\"&gt;WCFL&lt;/a&gt;, the Mighty 92 was also a favorite of teenagers in Western &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; who picked up the signal from across &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Michigan\"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt;.\nPopular disc jockeys on WOKY during the Top 40 years, from the 1950s through the 1970s, included Bob White, \"Mad Man\" Michaels, \"Lucky\" Logan, Mitch Michael, Sam Hale, Ron Riley (later with WLS Chicago), Bob Barry, Carl Como, Paul Christy, Michael Lee Scott, Jim Brown, Pat McKay, Jack McCoy, Ronnie Knight, Johnny Dark, Craig Roberts, Jack Lee, Robb Edwards, Gary Price, Gene Johnson, Jon \"Rock 'n Roll\" Anthony, Big Ron O'Brien, Barney Pip (later with WCFL Chicago) and &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Collins%20%28American%20radio%20broadcaster%29\"&gt;Bob Collins&lt;/a&gt; (later with Chicago's full-service giant &lt;a href=\"WGN%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WGN&lt;/a&gt;). A popular station catchphrase during the early 1970s was \"WOKY Plays Favorites\". WOKY is also noteworthy for being the first station in Milwaukee to broadcast traffic reports from a helicopter, courtesy of air personality Art Zander and his feature \"The Safer Route\".\nAs FM stations became the choice for radio listeners looking for contemporary music, WOKY shifted to an &lt;a href=\"adult%20standards\"&gt;adult standards&lt;/a&gt; format in 1981. It became a full-time &lt;a href=\"network%20affiliate\"&gt;affiliate&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Al%20Ham\"&gt;Al Ham&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Music%20of%20Your%20Life\"&gt;Music of Your Life&lt;/a&gt; format, based in &lt;a href=\"Connecticut\"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo keep up with demographic trends, WOKY tweaked the format over the years, gradually shifting to a &lt;a href=\"middle%20of%20the%20road%20%28music%29\"&gt;middle of the road&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"oldies\"&gt;oldies&lt;/a&gt; hybrid that mixed 1950s\u20131970s pop hits with classic and current &lt;a href=\"adult%20contemporary\"&gt;adult contemporary&lt;/a&gt; music, with artists such as &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Sinatra\"&gt;Frank Sinatra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Diamond\"&gt;Neil Diamond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Carpenters\"&gt;The Carpenters&lt;/a&gt; being mainstays of the format. Starting in 2005, WOKY began programming oldies all day on Fridays, complete with the station's old jingles and other elements. For many years, WOKY was a success in the ratings, though many of its listeners were older than the demographics that many advertisers actively seek. Starting in 1993, the station was known for pioneering marathons of &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20music\"&gt;Christmas music&lt;/a&gt; beginning on &lt;a href=\"Thanksgiving%20Day\"&gt;Thanksgiving Day&lt;/a&gt; and continuing through the holiday season.\nWOKY was briefly the Milwaukee outlet for \"&lt;a href=\"Delilah%20Rene\"&gt;Delilah&lt;/a&gt;\" in a &lt;a href=\"burning%20off\"&gt;burn off&lt;/a&gt; move after &lt;a href=\"sister%20station\"&gt;sister station&lt;/a&gt; WLTQ (now &lt;a href=\"WRNW\"&gt;WRNW&lt;/a&gt;) converted to a &lt;a href=\"classic%20rock\"&gt;classic rock&lt;/a&gt; format (Delilah was later heard in Milwaukee on &lt;a href=\"WMYX-FM\"&gt;WMYX-FM&lt;/a&gt;). WOKY also carried &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Milwaukee\"&gt;Milwaukee Panthers&lt;/a&gt; basketball game broadcasts from 2003 to 2007 when the team moved to &lt;a href=\"WISN%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WISN&lt;/a&gt;. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee women's basketball games can be heard on WOKY.\nIn 1997, WOKY and co-owned &lt;a href=\"WMIL-FM\"&gt;WMIL-FM&lt;/a&gt; were bought for $40 million by &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Channel%20Communications\"&gt;Clear Channel Communications&lt;/a&gt;, the forerunner of iHeartMedia.\nOn January 2, 2007, after concluding its Christmas holiday programming, WOKY came back with a new approach: an &lt;a href=\"oldies\"&gt;oldies&lt;/a&gt; format emphasizing hit songs from the 1960s and 1970s. The \"Mighty 92\" name returned full-time, as did many of the classic &lt;a href=\"jingle\"&gt;jingle&lt;/a&gt;s the station played in its Top 40 heyday. On nights and weekends, the station used &lt;a href=\"Dial%20Global\"&gt;Dial Global&lt;/a&gt;'s satellite-delivered \"Oldies Channel\" (now &lt;a href=\"Kool%20Gold\"&gt;Kool Gold&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Westwood%20One%20%28current%29\"&gt;Westwood One&lt;/a&gt;). With the new format, WOKY did not flip to all-Christmas music in 2007. Instead, like sister station &lt;a href=\"WRIT-FM\"&gt;WRIT&lt;/a&gt;, WOKY played a few Christmas tunes every hour. Today, the former Mighty 92 format can be heard in Milwaukee on &lt;a href=\"WRIT-FM\"&gt;WRIT&lt;/a&gt; 95.7-HD2.\nOn September 18, 2008, after playing \"&lt;a href=\"Hello%2C%20Goodbye\"&gt;Hello, Goodbye&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles\"&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt;, the station changed to &lt;a href=\"classic%20country%20music\"&gt;classic country music&lt;/a&gt; as \"The Wolf.\" The format was already being heard on sister station 106.1 WMIL-FM's &lt;a href=\"HD%20Radio\"&gt;HD Radio&lt;/a&gt; subchannel. The subchannel version had been &lt;a href=\"automation\"&gt;automated&lt;/a&gt; but when it debuted on AM 920, it featured several of WOKY's airstaff. The Wolf was sub-branded as \"MIL-WOKY, Milwaukee's Country Connection.\"\nOn December 1, 2011, the station announced it would become the Milwaukee home of &lt;a href=\"NASCAR\"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt; radio coverage from all three &lt;a href=\"NASCAR%20on%20television%20and%20radio%23NASCAR%20on%20radio\"&gt;NASCAR radio networks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway%20Radio%20Network\"&gt;Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brickyard%20400\"&gt;Brickyard 400&lt;/a&gt;. NASCAR moved to WOKY from &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20Radio\"&gt;ESPN Radio&lt;/a&gt; outlet &lt;a href=\"WAUK\"&gt;WAUK&lt;/a&gt;, which days before announced the removal of all auto racing programming to focus on solely on traditional sports. In September 2012, WOKY also added nationally broadcast college football and &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Westwood%20One%20%28current%29\"&gt;Westwood One Network&lt;/a&gt;, including \"The &lt;a href=\"NFL%20on%20Westwood%20One\"&gt;NFL on Westwood One&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOn January 2, 2013, Clear Channel Milwaukee announced that WOKY would drop its classic country format and adopt a &lt;a href=\"sports%20radio\"&gt;sports radio&lt;/a&gt; format on January 7. (In reality the branding launched on January 5 during the station's broadcasts of Wild Card Weekend games from Dial Global.) Branded as \"The Big 920,\" the new WOKY schedule became a near-&lt;a href=\"simulcast\"&gt;simulcast&lt;/a&gt; of its &lt;a href=\"Madison%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Madison&lt;/a&gt; sister station, &lt;a href=\"WTSO\"&gt;WTSO&lt;/a&gt; (\"The Big 1070\"), featuring Wisconsin-based local sports shows hosted by Brian Posick, Mike Heller, &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Lepay\"&gt;Matt Lepay&lt;/a&gt; and Mike Lucas. Also heard were national shows featuring \"&lt;a href=\"Jay%20Mohr\"&gt;Jay Mohr&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dan%20Patrick%20Show\"&gt;The Dan Patrick Show&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"NBC%20Sports%20Radio\"&gt;NBC Sports Radio&lt;/a&gt;, along with live event broadcasts that have been airing previously on WOKY, notably football, &lt;a href=\"NASCAR\"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Panthers\"&gt;Milwaukee Panthers&lt;/a&gt;. The move made WOKY the third English-language all-sports station in the Milwaukee market, joining &lt;a href=\"WAUK\"&gt;WAUK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WSSP\"&gt;WSSP&lt;/a&gt;, along with news/talk-formatted &lt;a href=\"WTMJ%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WTMJ&lt;/a&gt;'s commitment to evening sports talk and play by play coverage of &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Brewers\"&gt;Milwaukee Brewers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20Packers\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn December 2, 2013, Learfield Sports and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison announced that WOKY would become the Milwaukee station for &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20Badgers\"&gt;Wisconsin Badgers&lt;/a&gt; broadcasts, replacing longtime affiliate WTMJ, effectively making the team exclusive to iHeartMedia in the two largest cities in Wisconsin, with iHeart's &lt;a href=\"WIBA%20%28AM%29\"&gt;WIBA-AM&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"WIBA-FM\"&gt;FM&lt;/a&gt; in Madison acting as the &lt;a href=\"Flagship%20%28broadcasting%29\"&gt;flagship stations&lt;/a&gt; of the Badgers. As part of the deal, WOKY will air all Badgers sports broadcasts. Football and &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin%20Badgers%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;men's basketball&lt;/a&gt; are simulcast with sister station &lt;a href=\"WRIT-FM\"&gt;WRIT-FM&lt;/a&gt; due to WOKY's weak nighttime signal.\nOn November 27, 2018, &lt;a href=\"WRNW\"&gt;WRNW&lt;/a&gt; flipped from CHR to sports talk as \"97.3 The Game\", and WOKY's local programming was moved to the station. WOKY will now serve as a pass-through for Fox Sports Radio's daily lineup. In 2018, The station and &lt;a href=\"WVTV-DT2\"&gt;WVTV-DT2&lt;/a&gt; \u201cMy 24\u201d acquired the broadcasting rights to &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Admirals\"&gt;Milwaukee Admirals&lt;/a&gt; hockey, taking them away from sports talk rival &lt;a href=\"WSSP\"&gt;WSSP&lt;/a&gt; (then known as \u201c105.7 The Fan\u201d)."
