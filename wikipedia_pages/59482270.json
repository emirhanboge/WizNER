    "text": "The 1892\u201393 Colorado Agricultural CACs football team represented &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20State%20University\"&gt;Colorado Agricultural College&lt;/a&gt; (now known as Colorado State University) in its inaugural season during the 1892\u201393 academic year, with all games taking place in the early months of 1893. The team compiled a 2\u20132 record and was outscored by a total of 98 to 54. The team had no coach.\nOn December 12, 1892, a student named F.O. Congdon and 18 of the other 179 students enrolled at &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20State%20University\"&gt;Colorado Agricultural College&lt;/a&gt; at the time decided to form the school's first &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; team and compete with other schools in the area. The team's nickname (that would later be changed to Aggies, then Rams) was the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20State%20Rams\"&gt;CACs&lt;/a&gt;, the school's acronym (Colorado Agricultural College).\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas break&lt;/a&gt;, the team found some men at a small private hybrid college/high school named &lt;a href=\"Longmont%20College\"&gt;Longmont Academy&lt;/a&gt; who would challenge the CAC team to play the first game in each school's history. The game took place on January 7, 1893, in &lt;a href=\"Longmont%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Longmont, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier that morning, Colorado Agricultural players and fans bought &lt;a href=\"orange%20%28color%29\"&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"green\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; ribbons at a &lt;a href=\"dry%20goods%20store\"&gt;dry goods store&lt;/a&gt; in Longmont, choosing the school's colors."
