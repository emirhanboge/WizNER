    "text": "The Five Melikdoms of Karabakh, also known as Khamsa Melikdoms (), were &lt;a href=\"Armenians\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; feudal entities that existed on the territory of modern &lt;a href=\"Nagorno-Karabakh\"&gt;Nagorno-Karabakh&lt;/a&gt; and neighboring lands, from the times of the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Khachen\"&gt;Principality of Khachen&lt;/a&gt; in the 15th century and up to the abolition of ethnic feudal formations in the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 1822.\nEtymology.\n\"Khamsa\", also spelled \"Khamse\" or \"simply Khams\" means \u201cfive\u201d in Arabic. The principalities were ruled by \"meliks\". The term \"melik\" () \"meliq\", from \"&lt;a href=\"malik\"&gt;malik&lt;/a&gt;\" (king), designates an &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20nobility\"&gt;Armenian noble&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"title\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; in various &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Armenia\"&gt;Eastern Armenia&lt;/a&gt;n lands. The principalities ruled by meliks became known in English academic literature as \"melikdom\"s or \"melikates.\"\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThere were several Armenian melikates (dominions ruled by \"meliks\") in various parts of historical Armenia: in &lt;a href=\"Yerevan\"&gt;Yerevan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kars\"&gt;Kars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nakhchivansky%20Uyezd\"&gt;Nakhichevan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gegharkunik%20Province\"&gt;Gegharkunik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lori%20Province\"&gt;Lori&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Artsakh%20%28historic%20province%29\"&gt;Artsakh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Utik\"&gt;Utik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northwestern%20Iran\"&gt;Northwestern Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Syunik%20%28historic%20province%29\"&gt;Syunik&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Five Melikdoms were ruled by dynasties that represented branches of the earlier &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Khachen\"&gt;House of Khachen&lt;/a&gt; and were the descendants of the medieval &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Artsakh\"&gt;kings of Artsakh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the erosion of united Armenian statehood under the pressure from invading &lt;a href=\"Seljuk%20Turks\"&gt;Seljuk Turks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mongols\"&gt;Mongols&lt;/a&gt;, the Five Melikdoms were the most independent of all analogous Armenian principalities and saw themselves as holding onto the last bastion of Armenian independence.\nAutonomy.\nThe realm of the meliks in &lt;a href=\"Karabakh\"&gt;Karabakh&lt;/a&gt; was almost always semi-independent and often fully independent. The meliks had their recruit armies headed by \"centurions,\" their own castles and fortresses. The military complexes that contained recruiting organizations, fortification systems, signal beacons, and logistical support were known as syghnakhs (). There were two large \"syghnakhs\" shared by all meliks of Karabakh - the Major Syghnakh and the Lesser Syghnakh. The Major Syghnakh was located in melikdoms of Gulistan (Vardut), Jraberd and &lt;a href=\"Khachen\"&gt;Khachen&lt;/a&gt; and was supported by the fortresses of Gulistan, &lt;a href=\"Jraberd\"&gt;Jraberd&lt;/a&gt;, Havkakhaghats, Ishkhanaberd, &lt;a href=\"Kachaghakaberd\"&gt;Kachaghakaberd&lt;/a&gt; and Levonaberd. The Lesser Syghnakh was located in the melikdoms of Varanda and Dizak, and was supported by the fortresses &lt;a href=\"Shusha\"&gt;Shushi&lt;/a&gt;, Togh and Goroz. Both Lesser and Major syghnakhs were parts of a legacy defense system that remained from the times of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Artsakh\"&gt;Kingdom of Artsakh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe relationship between meliks and their subordinates was that of a military commanding officer and junior officer, and not of feudal lord and a serf. Peasants were often allowed to own land, were free and owned property.\nThe five Armenian principalities (&lt;a href=\"melik\"&gt;melik&lt;/a&gt;doms) in Karabakh were as follows:\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hasan-Jalalyan\"&gt;Hasan-Jalalyan&lt;/a&gt; family that ruled the principality of &lt;a href=\"Khachen\"&gt;Khachen&lt;/a&gt; was especially important, and was considered the most senior of the Five Melikdoms. They were direct descendants of Kings of &lt;a href=\"Caucasian%20Albania\"&gt;Caucasian Albania&lt;/a&gt; and symbolized the connection between patriarch &lt;a href=\"Hayk\"&gt;Hayk&lt;/a&gt;, the eponymous progenitor of the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20People\"&gt;Armenian People&lt;/a&gt;, considered as a great grandson of &lt;a href=\"Noah\"&gt;Noah&lt;/a&gt;, and medieval monarchs that ruled Armenia in the Middle Ages.\nHasan-Jalal traced his descent to the Armenian Arranshahik dynasty, a family that predated the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Parthia\"&gt;Parthia&lt;/a&gt;n Arsacids in the region. Hasan-Jalal's ancestry was \"almost exclusively\" Armenian according to historian &lt;a href=\"Robert%20H.%20Hewsen\"&gt;Robert H. Hewsen&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch of Hasan-Jalal Dawla's family roots were entrenched in an intricate array of royal marriages with new and old Armenian \"&lt;a href=\"nakharar\"&gt;nakharar&lt;/a&gt;\" families. Hasan-Jalal's grandfather was Hasan I (also known as Hasan the Great), a prince who ruled over the northern half of Artsakh. In 1182, he stepped down as ruler of the region and entered monastery life at &lt;a href=\"Dadivank\"&gt;Dadivank&lt;/a&gt;, and divided his land into two: the southern half (comprising much of Khachen) went to his oldest son Vahtang II (also known as Tangik) and the northern half went to the youngest, Gregory \"the Black.\" Vahtang II married Khorishah Zakarian, who was herself the daughter of Sargis Zakarian, the originator of the &lt;a href=\"Zakarid\"&gt;Zakarid&lt;/a&gt; line of Armenian princes in Georgia. When he married the daughter of the Arranshahik king of Dizak-Balk, Mamkan, Hasan-Jalal also inherited his father-in-law's lands.\nIn medieval times, the Hasan-Jalalian family branched into two functionally separate but connected lines: landed princes who ruled the Melikdom of Khachen and clergymen who manned the throne of &lt;a href=\"Catholicos\"&gt;Catholicos&lt;/a&gt; of Aghvank at the &lt;a href=\"Gandzasar%20monastery\"&gt;Holy See of Gandzasar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20Apostolic%20Church\"&gt;Armenian Apostolic Church&lt;/a&gt;. The clerical branch of the family was especially important. In 1441, a top military commander from the Hasan-Jalalyan family in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Kara%20Koyunlu\"&gt;Kara Koyunlu&lt;/a&gt; orchestrated the return of the Holy See of the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20Apostolic%20Church\"&gt;Armenian Apostolic Church&lt;/a&gt; from the Mediterranean town of Sis in &lt;a href=\"Cilicia\"&gt;Cilicia&lt;/a&gt; to its traditional location at &lt;a href=\"Mother%20See%20of%20Holy%20Etchmiadzin\"&gt;Etchmadzin&lt;/a&gt; in Armenia. Shortly after the event, Grigor X Jalalbegiants (1443\u20131465), representing the clerical branch of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hasan-Jalalyan\"&gt;Hasan-Jalalyans&lt;/a&gt;, was enthroned as the &lt;a href=\"Catholicos%20of%20All%20Armenians\"&gt;Catholicos of All Armenians&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mother%20See%20of%20Holy%20Etchmiadzin\"&gt;Etchmadzin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe principalities of Karabakh considered themselves direct descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, and were recognized as such by foreign powers.\nThe autonomous status of Armenian meliks in Karabakh was confirmed and re-confirmed by successive rulers of Persia. In 1603 Shah &lt;a href=\"Abbas%20I%20of%20Persia\"&gt;Abbas I&lt;/a&gt; recognized their special semi-independent status by a special edict.\nHowever, instability in &lt;a href=\"Safavid%20Iran\"&gt;Safavid Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//iranicaonline.org/articles/armenia-vi\"&gt;Armenian frustration&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Shia%20dynasties\"&gt;Islamic dominance.&lt;/a&gt; in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, turned &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Nagorno-Karabakh\"&gt;Karabakh&lt;/a&gt; into the epicenter of plans for an independent &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Armenia\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; state. This state, centered on the semi-independent &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Armenia\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; principalities of &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Artsakh\"&gt;Artsakh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Syunik%20Province\"&gt;Syunik&lt;/a&gt;, would be allied with &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; and both would be protected by fellow Christian Russia and European powers. \u00a0 Eventually the meliks agreed to pursue such an alliance. In 1678, &lt;a href=\"Catholicos\"&gt;Catholicos&lt;/a&gt; Hakob Jughayetsi (Jacob of Jugha, 1655\u20131680) called for a secret meeting in &lt;a href=\"Echmiadzin\"&gt;Echmiadzin&lt;/a&gt; to which he invited both meliks and clergy. He offered to lead a delegation to Europe, but died shortly after, largely causing the plan to be abandoned, but for the determination of one of the delegates, a young man, the son of &lt;a href=\"Melikdom%20of%20Kashatagh\"&gt;Melik Haikazyan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Melikdom%20of%20Kashatagh\"&gt;Kashatag&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Khnatsakh\"&gt;Khnatsakh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Syunik%20Province\"&gt;Zankezur / Syunik.&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Ori\"&gt;Israel Ori&lt;/a&gt;, who had served in the armies of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XIV of France&lt;/a&gt;, he tried to convince &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Wilhelm%2C%20Elector%20Palatine\"&gt;Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine&lt;/a&gt; (1658\u20131716), &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Innocent%20XII\"&gt;Pope Innocent XII&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Emperor of Austria, Leopold I&lt;/a&gt; to liberate &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt; from a foreign yoke and to send large amounts of money to the armed forces of &lt;a href=\"Nagorno-Karabakh\"&gt;Karabakh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Artsakh\"&gt;Armenians&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Ori\"&gt;Ori&lt;/a&gt; died in 1711 before securing unified support for &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Armenia\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; lands. Another prominent figure from &lt;a href=\"Nagorno-Karabakh\"&gt;Nagorno-Karabakh&lt;/a&gt; who worked to establish an &lt;a href=\"Nationalism%20and%20ancient%20history\"&gt;independent Armenian entity&lt;/a&gt; in his homeland was &lt;a href=\"Movses%20Baghramian\"&gt;Movses Baghramian&lt;/a&gt;. Baghramian together with the Armenian patriot &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Emin\"&gt;Joseph Emin&lt;/a&gt; (1726\u20131809), lobbied &lt;a href=\"Nagorno-Karabakh\"&gt;Karabakh's&lt;/a&gt; Armenian &lt;a href=\"Melik\"&gt;meliks&lt;/a&gt; to this same effect.\nIn the early 18th century, Persia's &lt;a href=\"Nader%20Shah\"&gt;Nader Shah&lt;/a&gt; took Karabakh out of control of the &lt;a href=\"Ganja%20Khanate\"&gt;Ganja khans&lt;/a&gt; as punishment for their support of the &lt;a href=\"Safavid\"&gt;Safavids&lt;/a&gt;, and placed it under his own control in which he granted the Armenian meliks supreme command over neighboring Armenian principalities as well as Muslim &lt;a href=\"Khan%20%28title%29\"&gt;khans&lt;/a&gt; in the Caucasus, in return for the &lt;a href=\"Melik\"&gt;meliks&lt;/a&gt;' victories over the invading &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Turks\"&gt;Turks&lt;/a&gt; in the 1720s. However, the Armenian &lt;a href=\"Melik\"&gt;meliks&lt;/a&gt; were only able to maintain &lt;a href=\"Autonomy\"&gt;autonomous&lt;/a&gt; control over the region until the mid-18th century. \nKarabakh Khanate.\nThe beginning of the end of the Khamsa Melikdoms of Karabakh came in the second half of the 18th century, when &lt;a href=\"Melik%20Shahnazar%20II\"&gt;Melik Shahnazar II&lt;/a&gt; allied himself with the &lt;a href=\"Khan%20%28title%29\"&gt;Khan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Panah%20Ali%20Khan\"&gt;Panah Ali Khan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Javanshir%20clan\"&gt;Javanshir clan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Afshar%20people\"&gt;Afshar-Oghuz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20peoples\"&gt;Turkic tribe&lt;/a&gt;, against the other Armenian meliks which led to the disintegration of the autonomous Armenian Melikdoms of Karabakh into the de facto independent &lt;a href=\"Karabakh%20Khanate\"&gt;Karabakh Khanate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Melik%20Shahnazar%20II\"&gt;Melik Shahnazar II&lt;/a&gt; was the first to accept &lt;a href=\"Panah%20Ali%20Khan\"&gt;Panah-Ali Khan's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"suzerainty\"&gt;suzerainty&lt;/a&gt; as the first Khan of the &lt;a href=\"Karabakh%20Khanate\"&gt;Karabakh Khanate&lt;/a&gt; and provided the latter with the strategic fortress of &lt;a href=\"Shusha\"&gt;Shushi (Shusha&lt;/a&gt;). \nDissolution and Integration into the Russian Empire.\nThe region came under &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; control in 1806 during the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Persian%20War%20%281804%E2%80%9313%29\"&gt;Russo-Persian War of 1804 to 1813&lt;/a&gt;, and was formally annexed in 1813 following the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Gulistan\"&gt;Treaty of Gulistan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; recognized the &lt;a href=\"sovereignty\"&gt;sovereign&lt;/a&gt; status of the five Armenian princes in their domains by a charter of the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Paul%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Paul I&lt;/a&gt; dated 2 June 1799.\nIn 1822, the Russian Empire abolished ethnic feudal formations, and the territory previously ruled by the Five Melikdoms subsequently became part of the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Elisabethpol%20Governorate\"&gt;Elisabethpol Governorate&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Yelizavetpolsky%20Uyezd\"&gt;Yelizavetpolsky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dzhevanshirsky%20Uyezd\"&gt;Dzhevanshirsky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dzhebrailsky%20Uyezd\"&gt;Dzhebrailsky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shushinsky%20Uyezd\"&gt;Shushinsky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uyezd\"&gt;uzeyds&lt;/a&gt;. Meliks preserved their rights and privileges after the rest of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Armenia\"&gt;Eastern Armenia&lt;/a&gt; became part of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them became high-ranking military officers in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russian%20Army\"&gt;Imperial Russian Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nThe name \"Mountainous Karabakh\" () came to become the most prominent name for the region controlled by the Five Armenian Melikdoms (\"Mountainous\" as opposed to the lowland &lt;a href=\"steppe\"&gt;steppe&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Karabakh\"&gt;Karabakh&lt;/a&gt; region). It maintained a strong &lt;a href=\"Armenians\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; presence and identity up into the modern age. It became the scene of several ethnic conflicts with neighboring &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijanis\"&gt;Azerbaijanis&lt;/a&gt;, including the establishment of the Armenian-populated &lt;a href=\"Nagorno-Karabakh%20Autonomous%20Oblast\"&gt;Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Azerbaijan SSR&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; in the early 20th century, and the &lt;a href=\"Karabakh%20movement\"&gt;Karabakh movement&lt;/a&gt; in the late 20th century which led to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Nagorno-Karabakh%20War\"&gt;First Nagorno-Karabakh War&lt;/a&gt; amid the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;dissolution of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, and the establishment of the Armenian &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Artsakh\"&gt;Republic of Artsakh&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn literature and Art.\nThe meliks of Karabakh inspired the historical novels \"The Five Melikdoms\" (1882) and \"&lt;a href=\"David%20Bek%20%28novel%29\"&gt;David Bek&lt;/a&gt;\" (1882) by &lt;a href=\"Raffi%20%28poet%29\"&gt;Raffi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"David%20Bek%20%28opera%29\"&gt;David Bek&lt;/a&gt;\" (1950) by &lt;a href=\"Armen%20Tigranian\"&gt;Armen Tigranian&lt;/a&gt; and the novel \"Mkhitar Sparapet\" (1961) by &lt;a href=\"Sero%20Khanzadyan\"&gt;Sero Khanzadyan&lt;/a&gt;. In 1944, \"&lt;a href=\"David%20Bek%20%28film%29\"&gt;David Bek&lt;/a&gt;\" the movie was filmed and in 1978, &lt;a href=\"Armenfilm\"&gt;Armenfilm&lt;/a&gt; in association with &lt;a href=\"Mosfilm\"&gt;Mosfilm&lt;/a&gt; produced another movie about the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Davit%20Bek\"&gt;Davit Bek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mkhitar%20Sparapet\"&gt;Mkhitar Sparapet&lt;/a&gt; called \"Huso Astgh\" (Star of Hope)."
