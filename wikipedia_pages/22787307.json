Gronow was also capped for the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; rugby league team while at Huddersfield, in 1911 against Australia (2 matches), and after being selected for the &lt;a href=\"1920%20Great%20Britain%20Lions%20tour\"&gt;1920 Great Britain Lions tour&lt;/a&gt; of Australasia, against Australia (2 matches), and New Zealand (3 matches).\nBen Gronow played as a &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20positions%23Forwards\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. number 8, in &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Giants\"&gt;Huddersfield&lt;/a&gt;'s 2\u20138 defeat by &lt;a href=\"Wakefield%20Trinity\"&gt;Wakefield Trinity&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1910%20Yorkshire%20Cup\"&gt;1910&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"RFL%20Yorkshire%20Cup\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20county%20cups\"&gt;County Cup&lt;/a&gt; Final during the &lt;a href=\"1910%E2%80%9311%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20Union%20season\"&gt;1910\u201311 season&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Headingley%20Stadium%23Rugby%20ground\"&gt;Headingley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Headingley%20Rugby%20Stadium\"&gt;Rugby Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday 3 December 1910, played as a &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20positions%23Forwards\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. number 10, and scored 4-&lt;a href=\"Goal%20%28sport%29%23Rugby%20football\"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt;s in the 18\u20138 victory over &lt;a href=\"Dewsbury\"&gt;Dewsbury&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1919%20%28Spring%29%20Yorkshire%20Cup\"&gt;1919&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"RFL%20Yorkshire%20Cup\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20county%20cups\"&gt;County Cup&lt;/a&gt; Final during the &lt;a href=\"1918%E2%80%9319%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20Union%20season\"&gt;1918\u201319 season&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Headingley%20Stadium%23Rugby%20ground\"&gt;Headingley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Headingley%20Rugby%20Stadium\"&gt;Rugby Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday 17 May 1919, played as a &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20positions%23Forwards\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. number 10, and scored 3-&lt;a href=\"Goal%20%28sport%29%23Rugby%20football\"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt;s in the 24\u20135 victory over &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1919%20%28Autumn%29%20Yorkshire%20Cup\"&gt;1919&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"RFL%20Yorkshire%20Cup\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20county%20cups\"&gt;County Cup&lt;/a&gt; Final during the &lt;a href=\"1919%E2%80%9320%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20Union%20season\"&gt;1919\u201320 season&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Thrum%20Hall\"&gt;Thrum Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halifax%2C%20West%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday 29 November 1919, and played as a &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20positions%23Forwards\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. number 8, and scored a &lt;a href=\"Goal%20%28sport%29%23Rugby%20football\"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; in the 4\u201310 defeat by &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1923%20Yorkshire%20Cup\"&gt;1923&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"RFL%20Yorkshire%20Cup\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league%20county%20cups\"&gt;County Cup&lt;/a&gt; Final during the &lt;a href=\"1923%E2%80%9324%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20League%20season\"&gt;1923\u201324 season&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Headingley%20Stadium%23Rugby%20ground\"&gt;Headingley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Headingley%20Rugby%20Stadium\"&gt;Rugby Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday 24 November 1923.\nGronow also played at least one game for the &lt;a href=\"Other%20Nationalities%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Other Nationalities&lt;/a&gt; team, on 5 February 1921 against England. The game was notable for the Other Nationalities side being entirely composed of Welsh players; but despite approaches to have the game recognised as a 'Wales' v England encounter the rugby league authorities refused to accept the request. Gronow became one of less than twenty-five Welshmen to have scored more than 1000-points in their rugby league career.\nGronow was selected for &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; while at Huddersfield for the &lt;a href=\"1924%20Great%20Britain%20Lions%20tour%20of%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;1924 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, he did not play in any of the &lt;a href=\"Test%20match%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Test match&lt;/a&gt;es on this tour.\nIn 1925 Gronow became the first British player to move down under when he went from Huddersfield to &lt;a href=\"Grenfell%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Grenfell, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; as their coach but returned two years later.\nBen Gronow made his d\u00e9but for Featherstone Rovers on Wednesday 13 March 1929.\nBen Gronow appears to have scored no drop-goals (or field-goals as they are currently known in Australasia), but prior to the &lt;a href=\"1974%E2%80%9375%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20League%20season\"&gt;1974\u201375 season&lt;/a&gt; all goals, whether; &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;conversion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20%28rugby%29%23Penalties%20in%20rugby%20league\"&gt;penalties&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Drop%20goal%23Rugby%20league\"&gt;drop-goal&lt;/a&gt;s, scored 2-points, consequently prior to this date drop-goals were often not explicitly documented, therefore '0' drop-goals may indicate drop-goals not recorded, rather than no drop-goals scored. In addition, prior to the &lt;a href=\"1949%E2%80%9350%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20League%20season\"&gt;1949\u201350 season&lt;/a&gt;, the archaic &lt;a href=\"Field%20goal%20%28rugby%29%23Rugby%20league\"&gt;field-goal&lt;/a&gt; was also still a valid means of scoring points.\nCoaching career.\nGronow was the coach for rugby union team &lt;a href=\"Morley%20R.F.C.\"&gt;Morley R.F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in the 1930s, however when a history of the club was produced some years later, due to his previous rugby league associations, he was identified as 'unknown' in a team photograph."
