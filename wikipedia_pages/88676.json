    "text": "Baugi (&lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt;: ; \"ring-shaped\") is a &lt;a href=\"j%C3%B6tunn\"&gt;j\u00f6tunn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Norse%20mythology\"&gt;Norse mythology&lt;/a&gt;. He is brother of &lt;a href=\"Suttungr\"&gt;Suttungr&lt;/a&gt;, the giant from whom &lt;a href=\"Odin\"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt; obtained the &lt;a href=\"mead%20of%20poetry\"&gt;mead of poetry&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt; name \"Baugi\" has been translated as 'ring-shaped'.\nAttestations.\nThe name of the &lt;a href=\"j%C3%B6tunn\"&gt;j\u00f6tunn&lt;/a&gt; Baugi is only mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"Sk%C3%A1ldskaparm%C3%A1l\"&gt;Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l&lt;/a&gt;\" (The Language of Poetry) and in the \"&lt;a href=\"Nafna%C3%BEulur\"&gt;\u00feulur&lt;/a&gt;\", and is not attested in other poetic texts. It is notably absent from \"&lt;a href=\"H%C3%A1vam%C3%A1l\"&gt;H\u00e1vam\u00e1l&lt;/a&gt;\" (Words of the High One), which &lt;a href=\"Snorri%20Sturluson\"&gt;Snorri Sturluson&lt;/a&gt; used as a source for the story of the &lt;a href=\"mead%20of%20poetry\"&gt;mead of poetry&lt;/a&gt;. Some scholars have argued that Baugi may have been an invention or a misunderstanding of \"H\u00e1vam\u00e1l\" by Snorri.\nMead of poetry.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Sk%C3%A1ldskaparm%C3%A1l\"&gt;Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Odin\"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt; causes Baugi's nine slaves to kill each other in his quest to obtain the &lt;a href=\"mead%20of%20poetry\"&gt;mead of poetry&lt;/a&gt;, possessed at that time by Baugi's brother, &lt;a href=\"Suttungr\"&gt;Suttungr&lt;/a&gt;. Calling himself &lt;a href=\"B%C3%B6lverk\"&gt;B\u00f6lverk&lt;/a&gt; ('Evil-deed' or 'Evil worker'), Odin then offers to do the labour of all nine men for Baugi as a reparation for his wrongdoings, in exchange of a wage of one drink of the mead of poetry. Baugi accepts to help him acquire it from his brother.\nAfter the summer of work is over, B\u00f6lverk (Odin) asks for his payment, but Suttungr refuses to give him a single drop of the mead. B\u00f6lverk then enlists Baugi's help to dig a hole into the &lt;a href=\"Hnitbjorg\"&gt;Hnitbj\u00f6rg mountain&lt;/a&gt; with Baugi's drill, &lt;a href=\"Rati%20%28Norse%20mythology%29\"&gt;Rati&lt;/a&gt;, in order to reach the chamber where the mead was kept and watched over by &lt;a href=\"Gunnl%C3%B6%C3%B0\"&gt;Gunnl\u00f6\u00f0&lt;/a&gt;, Suttung\u2019s daughter. When Baugi announces to him that the tunnel is finished, B\u00f6lverk blows into the hole but realizes that the other end is still blocked. As he understands that Baugi is trying to deceive him, B\u00f6lverk turns himself into a snake and slips into the hole. Baugi tries to strike at him with his auger but misses."
