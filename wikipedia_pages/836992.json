    "text": "An American in Canada is a &lt;a href=\"Television%20in%20Canada\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; television &lt;a href=\"situation%20comedy\"&gt;sitcom&lt;/a&gt; that aired on &lt;a href=\"CBC%20Television\"&gt;CBC Television&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 and 2004.\nThe show starred &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Roberts%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Rick Roberts&lt;/a&gt; as Jake Crewe, an American television news host who was forced, after beating up his station manager, to accept a job in &lt;a href=\"Calgary\"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alberta\"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt; as co-host of the lowest-rated morning news program in the city. The show found its comedy in Crewe's attempts to adapt to Canadian culture, as well as his interactions with coworkers such as producer and love interest Judy Surgick (&lt;a href=\"H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne%20Joy\"&gt;H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy&lt;/a&gt;) and egotistical host Dennis McIlvane (&lt;a href=\"Stewart%20Francis\"&gt;Stewart Francis&lt;/a&gt;).\n\"An American in Canada\" was loosely based on the real-life experiences of &lt;a href=\"Jebb%20Fink\"&gt;Jebb Fink&lt;/a&gt;, an American comedian who moved to Canada after marrying a Canadian woman, and did become a morning television host on &lt;a href=\"CKAL-DT\"&gt;CKAL-TV&lt;/a&gt;, Calgary's &lt;a href=\"A-Channel%20%28Craig%20Media%29\"&gt;A-Channel&lt;/a&gt; station. It was created by Fink and &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Busgang\"&gt;Howard Busgang&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe show's pilot aired as a special in January 2002 as part of the CBC's early-2000s strategy of airing comedy pilots to test viewer reaction before ordering the production of a full series. Viewer reaction was overwhelmingly positive, and the series went into production and premiered in 2003. The show produced 16 episodes over two seasons before being cancelled in 2004.\nThe program won the &lt;a href=\"Gemini%20Award\"&gt;Gemini Award&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Screen%20Award%20for%20Best%20Comedy%20Series\"&gt;Best Comedy Program or Series&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"17th%20Gemini%20Awards\"&gt;17th Gemini Awards&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has also aired on &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Comedy%20Channel\"&gt;The Comedy Channel&lt;/a&gt; with the title \"Frostbite\", and in syndication on &lt;a href=\"Showcase%20%28Canadian%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;Showcase&lt;/a&gt; in Canada and &lt;a href=\"HDNet\"&gt;HDNet&lt;/a&gt; in the USA."
