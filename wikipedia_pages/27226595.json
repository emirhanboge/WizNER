    "text": "The 776th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron is a provisional &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; squadron activated after 11 September 2001, being engaged in the &lt;a href=\"Global%20War%20on%20Terrorism\"&gt;Global War on Terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. Its current status is not publicly known.\nThe &lt;a href=\"squadron%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; was first active during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; as the 776th Bombardment Squadron. The squadron flew &lt;a href=\"Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator\"&gt;Consolidated B-24 Liberator&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Theater%20of%20Operations\"&gt;Mediterranean Theater of Operations&lt;/a&gt;, earning two &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Unit%20Citation\"&gt;Distinguished Unit Citation&lt;/a&gt;s for its actions. Following the war, the squadron helped transport troops back to the United States.\nThe squadron was reactivated in 1953 as the 776th Troop Carrier Squadron, when it replaced the &lt;a href=\"71st%20Troop%20Carrier%20Squadron\"&gt;71st Troop Carrier Squadron&lt;/a&gt;, a reserve unit that had been called to active duty for the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lawson%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Lawson Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, Georgia. It moved to &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Pope Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, North Carolina, where it successively flew &lt;a href=\"Fairchild%20C-119%20Flying%20Boxcar\"&gt;Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Fairchild%20C-123%20Provider\"&gt;Fairchild C-123 Provider&lt;/a&gt;s. It deployed to Vietnam as part of &lt;a href=\"Project%20Mule%20Train\"&gt;Project Mule Train&lt;/a&gt;, until transferring its deployed &lt;a href=\"aircrew\"&gt;crews&lt;/a&gt; and planes to the &lt;a href=\"310th%20Troop%20Carrier%20Squadron\"&gt;310th Troop Carrier Squadron&lt;/a&gt; in 1963. Upon its return to Pope, it converted to &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules\"&gt;Lockheed C-130 Hercules&lt;/a&gt; aircraft. It moved to the Pacific and again provided airlift support in Southeast Asia until inactivating in October 1975.\nHistory.\nWorld War II.\nThe 776th Bombardment Squadron was activated on 1 August 1943 at &lt;a href=\"Wendover%20Field\"&gt;Wendover Field&lt;/a&gt;, Utah as a &lt;a href=\"Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator\"&gt;Consolidated B-24 Liberator&lt;/a&gt; heavy bombardment unit. The &lt;a href=\"squadron%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; was one of the &lt;a href=\"464th%20Bombardment%20Group\"&gt;464th Bombardment Group&lt;/a&gt;'s four original squadrons, After gathering its initial &lt;a href=\"cadre%20%28military%29\"&gt;cadre&lt;/a&gt;, the squadron moved to &lt;a href=\"Gowen%20Field\"&gt;Gowen Field&lt;/a&gt;, Idaho for training with &lt;a href=\"II%20Bomber%20Command\"&gt;II Bomber Command&lt;/a&gt;. After training in Idaho and Utah, the squadron began its move to the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Theater%20of%20Operations\"&gt;Mediterranean Theater of Operations&lt;/a&gt; in February 1944.\nThe 776th deployed to southern Italy in February 1944, where it became part of &lt;a href=\"Fifteenth%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Fifteenth Air Force&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"55th%20Bombardment%20Wing\"&gt;55th Bombardment Wing&lt;/a&gt;. The air echelon trained for a few weeks in Tunisia before joining the remainder of the group in Italy and entering combat in April.\nThe group engaged in long range strategic bombing missions to enemy military, industrial and transportation targets in Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia, bombing railroad marshaling yards, oil refineries, airdrome installations, heavy industry, and other strategic objectives.\nNotable missions of the &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Campaign%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Oil Campaign of World War II&lt;/a&gt; included &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Tidal%20Wave\"&gt;Operation Tidal Wave&lt;/a&gt;, bombing of the Concordia Vega Refinery near &lt;a href=\"Ploie%C8%99ti\"&gt;Ploie\u0219ti&lt;/a&gt; on 18 May 1944, the &lt;a href=\"marshaling%20yard\"&gt;marshaling yard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinery&lt;/a&gt; at Vienna on 8 July 1944, for which the squadron was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Unit%20Citation\"&gt;Distinguished Unit Citation&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Pardubice\"&gt;Pardubice&lt;/a&gt; oil refinery and nearby railroad tracks on 24 August 1944, for which it also was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation.\nThe squadron sometimes engaged in &lt;a href=\"air%20support\"&gt;air support&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"air%20interdiction\"&gt;air interdiction&lt;/a&gt; operations. It supported Allied forces during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Dragoon\"&gt;Operation Dragoon&lt;/a&gt;, the invasion of Southern France, in August 1944. It hit railroad centers to assist the advance of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; in southeastern Europe in March 1945. It bombed enemy supply lines to assist &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Grapeshot\"&gt;Operation Grapeshot&lt;/a&gt;, the advance of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20North\"&gt;US Fifth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;British Eighth Army&lt;/a&gt; in northern Italy in April 1945.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"V-E%20Day\"&gt;V-E Day&lt;/a&gt;, the squadron was assigned to the Green Project, the movement of troops from Europe to the United States via the South Atlantic Transport Route. B-24s were modified with sealed bomb bays, removal of all defensive armament and internal fuselage equipped with seating to carry approximately 30 personnel. It was assigned to &lt;a href=\"Air%20Transport%20Command\"&gt;Air Transport Command&lt;/a&gt; (ATC) at &lt;a href=\"Waller%20Field\"&gt;Waller Field&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trinidad\"&gt;Trinidad&lt;/a&gt;. The group moved personnel from &lt;a href=\"Natal%2C%20Brazil\"&gt;Natal, Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atkinson%20Field\"&gt;Atkinson Field&lt;/a&gt;, British Guiana to &lt;a href=\"Morrison%20Field\"&gt;Morrison Field&lt;/a&gt;, Florida. It provided air transport until the end of July when the unit was inactivated and its personnel assigned to elements of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Atlantic%20Wing%2C%20Air%20Transport%20Command\"&gt;South Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Wing%2C%20Air%20Transport%20Command\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; Wings of ATC.\nReplacement of reserve wing.\nThe squadron was redesignated the 776th Troop Carrier Squadron and activated at &lt;a href=\"Lawson%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Lawson Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, Georgia on 1 February 1953. The squadron replaced the &lt;a href=\"71st%20Troop%20Carrier%20Squadron\"&gt;71st Troop Carrier Squadron&lt;/a&gt;, a reserve unit that had been called to active duty for the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt; with its parent &lt;a href=\"434th%20Troop%20Carrier%20Wing\"&gt;434th Troop Carrier Wing&lt;/a&gt;. The 434th Wing was in the process of transitioning from the &lt;a href=\"Curtiss%20C-46%20Commando\"&gt;Curtiss C-46 Commando&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Fairchild%20C-119%20Flying%20Boxcar\"&gt;Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar&lt;/a&gt; when the squadron took over the personnel and aircraft of the 71st. In September 1954, the squadron moved to &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Pope Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, North Carolina where it was colocated with the Army's &lt;a href=\"82d%20Airborne%20Division\"&gt;82d Airborne Division&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Bragg\"&gt;Fort Bragg&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe unit provided tactical airlift of troops and cargo, participated in joint airborne training with Army forces, and took part in tactical exercises in the United States and overseas. The squadron provided aeromedical airlift and flew humanitarian missions as required.\nAssault operations and early Vietnam support.\nIn November 1957, the 464th Troop Carrier Wing converted to the dual deputy organization. The wing's 464th Troop Carrier Group was inactivated, and the squadron was assigned directly to the wing. The squadron, meanwhile, began trading its C-119s for &lt;a href=\"Fairchild%20C-123%20Provider\"&gt;Fairchild C-123 Provider&lt;/a&gt;s before the end of the year.\nStarting in 1962, the Air Force had been providing airlift support in Vietnam with Providers under &lt;a href=\"Project%20Mule%20Train\"&gt;Project Mule Train&lt;/a&gt;. The operation had grown to the size of three squadrons by the summer of 1963, mostly supported by deployed aircraft and &lt;a href=\"aircrew\"&gt;crews&lt;/a&gt; from the 464th Wing. When the Air Force decided to replace deployed units with regular units, deployed crews and airplanes at &lt;a href=\"Tan%20Son%20Nhut%20Airport\"&gt;Tan Son Nhut Airport&lt;/a&gt; were assigned to the 776th, which was reassigned to the &lt;a href=\"315th%20Troop%20Carrier%20Group\"&gt;315th Troop Carrier Group&lt;/a&gt; there. Seven days later, these crews and their aircraft became the newly-activated &lt;a href=\"310th%20Troop%20Carrier%20Squadron\"&gt;310th Troop Carrier Squadron&lt;/a&gt;, and the 776th was returned to the control of the 464th Wing. However, on the day of its return, it became a medium troop carrier squadron and began transitioning into the &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules\"&gt;Lockheed C-130 Hercules&lt;/a&gt;.\nC-130 Hercules operations.\nIn 1964, the &lt;a href=\"Simba%20rebellion\"&gt;Simba rebellion&lt;/a&gt; began in the Congo and rebels gained control of large areas of the eastern part of the country, including &lt;a href=\"Kisangani\"&gt;Stanleyville&lt;/a&gt; and the United States &lt;a href=\"consulate\"&gt;consulate&lt;/a&gt; there, taking several &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20State%20Department\"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; employees and others captive. The United States set up a Joint Task Force, which included four C-130s of the 464th Wing to rescue State Department employees in Stanleyville. The Wing's commitment increased to 14 aircraft with the development of an expanded rescue plan called &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Dragon%20Rouge\"&gt;Operation Dragon Rouge&lt;/a&gt;. These aircraft, some from the 776th Squadron, were on rotation duty with the &lt;a href=\"322d%20Air%20Division\"&gt;322d Air Division&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Evreux%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Evreux Air Base&lt;/a&gt;, France and were conveniently located to airlift Belgian forces. The wing dropped Belgian paratroops into Stanleyville, and after the runways were cleared, landed additional troops at &lt;a href=\"Simi-Simi%20Airport\"&gt;Simi-Simi Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Once the city was secured, the C-130s began shuttling refugees out of the city, under fire as they departed, and with 100 passengers on each plane. Five aircraft were damaged as 2,000 refugees were evacuated. An additional 500\u20131000 were evacuated from &lt;a href=\"Isiro\"&gt;Paulis&lt;/a&gt; in a follow-on operation, although not all hostages could be rescued and a number were executed by the Simba rebels. The 464th Wing received the &lt;a href=\"Mackay%20Trophy\"&gt;Mackay Trophy&lt;/a&gt; for this operation.\nIn March 1965, the squadron participated in Operation Steep Hill XIII to protect Alabama citizens during the &lt;a href=\"Selma%20to%20Montgomery%20marches%23March%20to%20Montgomery\"&gt;civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;. In April 1965, the United States decided to deploy troops to the Dominican Republic following the start of a &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; there. on 30 April, the wing airlanded the 3rd Brigade of the 82d Airborne Division at &lt;a href=\"San%20Isidro%20Air%20Base\"&gt;San Isidro Air Base&lt;/a&gt;. The 46 aircraft dispatched to San Isidro so overcrowded the field that many were unable to unload and some had to be diverted to &lt;a href=\"Ramey%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Ramey Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, Puerto Rico. The following day, \"an air bridge was established between Pope and San Isidro . . . with a transport . . . landing on an average . . . once every five minutes.\" In late May, the operation in the Dominican Republic came under the aegis of the &lt;a href=\"Organization%20of%20American%20States\"&gt;Organization of American States&lt;/a&gt; and American planes flew in the first Latin American troops.\nPacific Air Forces.\nWhile the squadron supported &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Power%20Pack\"&gt;Operation Power Pack&lt;/a&gt;, it was also rotating crews for missions in Southeast Asia. It moved to &lt;a href=\"Tachikawa%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Tachikawa Air Base&lt;/a&gt;, Japan on 26 December 1965 to augment the airlift operations of the &lt;a href=\"315th%20Air%20Division\"&gt;315th Air Division&lt;/a&gt;, the manager of airlift operations for &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Air%20Forces\"&gt;Pacific Air Forces&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of March 1966, it was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"314th%20Troop%20Carrier%20Wing\"&gt;314th Troop Carrier Wing&lt;/a&gt; and joined the wing at &lt;a href=\"Ching%20Chuan%20Kang%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Ching Chuan Kang Air Base&lt;/a&gt;, Taiwan on 1 April.\nThe squadron conducted combat airlift into Vietnam, transporting troops, equipment, and supplies to various bases in Southeast Asia. Squadron crews rotated to &lt;a href=\"Cam%20Ranh%20Bay%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Cam Ranh Bay Air Base&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tan%20Son%20Nhut%20Airport\"&gt;Tan Son Nhut Airport&lt;/a&gt; to fly missions. In January 1967 it participated in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Junction%20City\"&gt;Operation Junction City&lt;/a&gt;. It flew shuttle missions to &lt;a href=\"Bangkok\"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tuy%20Hoa\"&gt;Tuy Hoa&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1968 the squadron supported the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Khe%20Sahn\"&gt;Siege of Khe Sahn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Delaware\"&gt;Operation Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"A%20Shau%20Valley\"&gt;A Shau Valley&lt;/a&gt; Campaign. It also supported, &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Banish%20Beach\"&gt;Operation Banish Beach&lt;/a&gt;. In 1969, Operations Commando Twist and Commando Image and operations at Katum, Bu Prang and An Hua. In 1971 it supported Operations Lam Son 719 and 720. At the end of May 1971, the &lt;a href=\"314th%20Tactical%20Airlift%20Wing\"&gt;314th Tactical Airlift Wing&lt;/a&gt; moved without personnel to &lt;a href=\"Little%20Rock%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Little Rock Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; to replace the &lt;a href=\"64th%20Tactical%20Airlift%20Wing\"&gt;64th Tactical Airlift Wing&lt;/a&gt; there, while its personnel and equipment were transferred to the &lt;a href=\"374th%20Tactical%20Airlift%20Wing\"&gt;374th Tactical Airlift Wing&lt;/a&gt;, which moved on paper from &lt;a href=\"Naha%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Naha Air Base&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1973 it participated in the Battle of An Loc, Republic of Vietnam (Easter Airlift). Squadron detachments operated From Tan Son Nhut, &lt;a href=\"U-Tapao%20Royal%20Thai%20Navy%20Airfield\"&gt;U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nakhon%20Phanom%20Royal%20Thai%20Navy%20Base\"&gt;Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Navy Base&lt;/a&gt;, Thailand. On 28 January 1973 a crew from the squadron and a crew from the &lt;a href=\"345th%20Tactical%20Airlift%20Squadron\"&gt;345th Tactical Airlift Squadron&lt;/a&gt; flew into &lt;a href=\"Hanoi\"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt; to bring a North Vietnamese delegation back to Tan Son Nhut Airport near Saigon. In November 1973, the 374th Wing and the squadron moved to &lt;a href=\"Clark%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Clark Air Base&lt;/a&gt; in the Philippines.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Saigon\"&gt;Saigon&lt;/a&gt; fell in April 1975, the squadron airlifted Vietnamese orphans from the city during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Baby%20Lift\"&gt;Operation Baby Lift&lt;/a&gt;. On 29 April 1975 a C-130 with a crew from the 776th was hit by rocket/mortar fire, causing the aircraft to catch fire while taxiing to pick up passengers for evacuation. This event essentially ended the fixed wing air evacuation. The crew evacuated the aircraft and joined the only other plane at the airport, flown by a &lt;a href=\"21st%20Tactical%20Airlift%20Squadron\"&gt;21st Tactical Airlift Squadron&lt;/a&gt; aircrew. This departing flight was the last fixed wing aircraft to leave carrying refugees out of Tan Son Nhut as Saigon was being overrun by the North Vietnamese. The squadron was inactivated in July 1975.\nExpeditionary operations.\nActivated as a C-130 Hercules airlift squadron as part of the &lt;a href=\"Global%20War%20on%20Terrorism\"&gt;Global War on Terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. The squadron has participated in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom\"&gt;Operation Enduring Freedom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Iraqi%20Freedom\"&gt;Operation Iraqi Freedom&lt;/a&gt;."
