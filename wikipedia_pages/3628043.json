    "text": "Devil's Island (&lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;: \u00cele du Diable) is the third-largest island of the &lt;a href=\"Salvation%20Islands\"&gt;Salvation Islands&lt;/a&gt;, an island group in the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. It is located approximately 14\u00a0km (9\u00a0mi) off the coast of &lt;a href=\"French%20Guiana\"&gt;French Guiana&lt;/a&gt; in South America just north of the town of &lt;a href=\"Kourou\"&gt;Kourou&lt;/a&gt;. It has an area of 14\u00a0&lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;ha&lt;/a&gt; (34.6\u00a0&lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s). The island was a part of a &lt;a href=\"Devil%27s%20Island\"&gt;controversial French penal colony&lt;/a&gt; located in French Guiana for 101\u00a0years, from 1852 to 1953. Although it was the smallest part of the penal colony, it is notorious for being used for internal exile of French political prisoners during that period. The most famous political prisoner on Devil's Island was Captain &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Dreyfus\"&gt;Alfred Dreyfus&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse as a penal colony.\n\u00cele du Diable is rocky and palm-covered. It rises above sea level. Its development as a penal colony was begun in 1852 by the government of &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20III%20of%20France\"&gt;Emperor Napoleon\u00a0III&lt;/a&gt;. The island is surrounded by rocky promontories and &lt;a href=\"shoal\"&gt;shoal&lt;/a&gt;s, strong &lt;a href=\"Rip%20current\"&gt;cross-currents&lt;/a&gt; and shark-infested waters. Landing on the island by boat is so treacherous that prison officials constructed a &lt;a href=\"Aerial%20lift\"&gt;cable car&lt;/a&gt; system to connect the island to the nearby &lt;a href=\"%C3%8Ele%20Royale\"&gt;\u00cele Royale&lt;/a&gt;. They used the cable car for years to travel the 180\u00a0m (600\u00a0ft)-wide channel between the two islands.\n\u00cele du Diable was first used to house the prison system's &lt;a href=\"leper%20colony\"&gt;leper colony&lt;/a&gt;. With no understanding of the cause of &lt;a href=\"leprosy\"&gt;leprosy&lt;/a&gt; (now also known as &lt;a href=\"Hansen%27s%20disease\"&gt;Hansen's disease&lt;/a&gt;), nor means of treatment, societies isolated its sufferers. Well before 1895, the French converted facilities on the island to house primarily political prisoners.\nAftermath.\nIn 1953, the prison system was closed. In 1965, the French government transferred the responsibility for the island, with the rest of the group, to its newly founded &lt;a href=\"Guiana%20Space%20Centre\"&gt;Guiana Space Centre&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"CNES\"&gt;CNES&lt;/a&gt; space agency, in association with other agencies, has restored buildings classified as historical monuments. Since tourism facilities have been added, the islands now receive more than 50,000\u00a0tourists each year."
