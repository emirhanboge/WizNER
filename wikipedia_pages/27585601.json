    "text": "Joseph Vincent Sullivan (August 15, 1919\u2014September 4, 1982) was an American &lt;a href=\"prelate\"&gt;prelate&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;. He served as &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Baton%20Rouge\"&gt;Bishop of Baton Rouge&lt;/a&gt; from 1974 until his death in 1982. He also was credibly accused by several parishioners of sexual abuse later admitted by the Diocese of Baton Rouge.\nBiography.\nJoseph Sullivan was born in &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Kansas City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, to John Lawrence and Anastasia Agnes (n\u00e9e Presser) Sullivan. He received his early education at local &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20school\"&gt;Catholic school&lt;/a&gt;s, and began his &lt;a href=\"seminary\"&gt;seminary&lt;/a&gt; formation in Missouri. He then studied at the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.theologicalcollege.org/\"&gt;Sulpician Seminary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20University%20of%20America\"&gt;Catholic University of America&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; He was &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Orders\"&gt;ordained&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"priesthood%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;priesthood&lt;/a&gt; on June 1, 1946. He earned a &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Sacred%20Theology\"&gt;doctorate in theology&lt;/a&gt; from the Catholic University in 1949.\nAs a priest of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Kansas%20City-Saint%20Joseph\"&gt;Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph&lt;/a&gt;, Sullivan served as assistant &lt;a href=\"Superintendent%20%28education%29\"&gt;superintendent&lt;/a&gt; (1948\u201350) and superintendent (1951\u201357) of diocesan schools. From 1957 to 1967, he was &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20%28ecclesiastical%29\"&gt;chancellor&lt;/a&gt; of the diocese. On March 4, 1967, he was appointed &lt;a href=\"auxiliary%20bishop\"&gt;auxiliary bishop&lt;/a&gt; of Kansas City-St. Joseph and &lt;a href=\"titular%20bishop\"&gt;titular bishop&lt;/a&gt; of \"Thagamuta\" by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Paul%20VI\"&gt;Pope Paul VI&lt;/a&gt;. He received his &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;episcopal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"consecration\"&gt;consecration&lt;/a&gt; on the following April 3 from Bishop &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Herman%20Helmsing\"&gt;Charles Herman Helmsing&lt;/a&gt;, with Cardinal &lt;a href=\"John%20Cody\"&gt;John Cody&lt;/a&gt; and Bishop &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20M.%20Marling\"&gt;Joseph M. Marling&lt;/a&gt; serving as &lt;a href=\"Consecrator\"&gt;co-consecrators&lt;/a&gt;. As an auxiliary bishop, he also served as &lt;a href=\"vicar%20general\"&gt;vicar general&lt;/a&gt; of the diocese.\nFollowing the resignation of Bishop &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Emmet%20Tracy\"&gt;Robert Emmet Tracy&lt;/a&gt;, Sullivan was named the second &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Baton%20Rouge\"&gt;Bishop of Baton Rouge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, on August 8, 1974. His installation took place at the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Joseph%20Cathedral%20%28Baton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana%29\"&gt;Cathedral of St. Joseph&lt;/a&gt; on September 4 of that year. He was strongly &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; and emphasized fidelity to Catholic doctrine. In February 1979, he refused to allow theologian &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Curran%20%28theologian%29\"&gt;Charles Curran&lt;/a&gt;, whom Sullivan denounced as \"heretical\" and \"not in accord with Catholic teaching\", to speak at the Catholic Campus Ministry at &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20State%20University\"&gt;Louisiana State University&lt;/a&gt;. After he removed the &lt;a href=\"Claretians\"&gt;Claretian Fathers&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"chaplain\"&gt;chaplain&lt;/a&gt;cy at Louisiana State University in March 1979, 51 priests filed a list of grievances with the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Holy See&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn February 1981, Sullivan issued a &lt;a href=\"pastoral%20letter\"&gt;pastoral letter&lt;/a&gt; in which he declared that ministries to divorced and remarried Catholics \"may not witness, explicitly or implicitly, that the living Church condones the marital lifestyle of those living in an invalid marriage.\" An outspoken supporter of the &lt;a href=\"pro-life%20movement\"&gt;pro-life movement&lt;/a&gt;, he frequently condemned &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"euthanasia\"&gt;euthanasia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1981, he was the only Catholic bishop to vote against providing the endorsement of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Conference%20of%20Catholic%20Bishops\"&gt;National Conference of Catholic Bishops&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Life%20Amendment\"&gt;Hatch Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, saying, \"Plain logic tells us this is a compromise, and I don't think we have to accept a compromise.\" He also promoted Catholic education, establishing elementary schools and planning for a new high school. Sullivan later died at age 63.\nIn October 2009, the Diocese of Baton Rouge paid $225,000 to settle a lawsuit in which a man from &lt;a href=\"Houston\"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, claimed he was &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20sex%20abuse%20cases\"&gt;sexually abused&lt;/a&gt; by Sullivan as a seminarian between 1978 and 1982. A &lt;a href=\"St.%20Michael%20the%20Archangel%20High%20School%20%28East%20Baton%20Rouge%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana%29\"&gt;Louisiana high school&lt;/a&gt; named after Sullivan changed its name in 2005 following the settlement of a separate lawsuit alleging Sullivan had sexually abused a minor boy."
