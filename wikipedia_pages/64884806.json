In 1935, he obtained professional qualifications allowing him to teach drawing in Polish in general secondary schools or as a state/private teacher in training &lt;a href=\"seminary\"&gt;seminaries&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, he took an active part in the artistic life of Bydgoszcz and &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Poland\"&gt;Greater Poland&lt;/a&gt;. He was the chairman of the \"Pomeranian Artists' Union\" and the secretary of the \"Artistic and Cultural Council of Bydgoszcz\" (1937-1939). From 1930, he was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Polish%20Artists%20and%20Designers\"&gt;Association of Polish Artists and Designers&lt;/a&gt; (as will be in 1945, Bydgoszcz sculptor &lt;a href=\"Piotr%20Triebler\"&gt;Piotr Triebler&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Writers%27%20Union\"&gt;Polish Writers' Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a writer and artist, Marian made his debut in the \"Wrze\u015bnia Spokesman\" ().\nIn 1926, his first book was published, \"Legends of Wrze\u015bnia\", and a year later, the first exhibition of his paintings was held in Wrze\u015bnia. From this moment on, Marian started using the nickname \"Turwid\". Later, he will change his name to \"Turwid-Kaczmarek\". Between 1931 and 1937, he has been the &lt;a href=\"Editor-in-chief\"&gt;chief editor&lt;/a&gt; of the artistic and literary monthly \"Wici Wielkopolskie\".\nIn 1931, he published a book of drawings (\"Portrait Sketches\") and a portrait of General &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zef%20Haller\"&gt;J\u00f3zef Haller&lt;/a&gt;, which was his diploma work crowning his studies at the Krakow Academy of Fine Arts. In 1932, a volume of poetry was published, (\"The Days of the Great Valley\"). Some of his poems found their way up into national anthologies, such as (\"Sea in Polish Poetry\") in 1937 or (\"120th Anthology\") in 1939 and 1947. Turwid also wrote articles about culture and literature for several daily newspapers: , , , and . From time to time, he contributed to the Pozna\u0144 cultural monthly (\"Rainbow magazine\") and the &lt;a href=\"Kashubia\"&gt;Kashubia&lt;/a&gt;n (\"&lt;a href=\"Griffin\"&gt;Griffin&lt;/a&gt;\"). He made various artistic trips to hone his painting skills: &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; (1936), &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;.

Many poems were devoted to &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt; and his symbols: &lt;a href=\"The%20Archer%20%28Lepcke%29\"&gt;The Archer&lt;/a&gt;, the old &lt;a href=\"granary\"&gt;granaries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mill%20Island%20in%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Mill Island&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz%20Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bydgoszcz%20Venice\"&gt;Bydgoszcz Venice&lt;/a&gt; (). These places and figures released in him the need for a personal tie with the city's architecture, its nature and its inhabitants. His identity reflects the 1930s local mood towards organizing an environmental culture in Bydgoszcz, open to national literary trends.\n&lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; period.\nIn the first days of the &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;German occupation&lt;/a&gt;, Marian was arrested by the &lt;a href=\"Gestapo\"&gt;Gestapo&lt;/a&gt;, who confiscated his studio with all his artistic works. In autumn 1939, he moved to his hometown Wrze\u015bnia where he worked in his parents' company until 1942.

On his initiative, the &lt;a href=\"Pomeranian%20Arts%20House%20in%20Bydgoszcz\"&gt;Pomeranian Arts House in Bydgoszcz&lt;/a&gt; was created, where a permanent art exhibition was established with contributions coming from Pomeranian members of the \"&lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Polish%20Artists%20and%20Designers\"&gt;Association of Polish Artists and Designers&lt;/a&gt;\".

His works often revolved around the people and topics of the region in which he lived and worked. As a citizen of Bydgoszcz, councilor and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Democrats%20%28Poland%29%23During%20Communism%20%281946-1988%29\"&gt;democrat&lt;/a&gt; activist, he coped with themes related to the city:\nHis articles, prefaces to catalogs and materials, gathered in collective local publications portray his knowledge of the city, in particular its post-war specifics.\nAs far as his artistic side is concerned, Marian Turwid was rather prolific: out of his 189 works, 125 were displayed at exhibitions in Poland and abroad.\nAfter a long period of disinterest towards politics, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Faction%20%281937%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; in 1945, then the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Democrats%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; () in 1950: in 1955\u20131956, Turwid was the vice-president of the Presidium of the Provincial SD Committee in Bydgoszcz, and in 1963 he became the SD chairman of the \"Provincial Advisory Group for Culture\", member of the \"SD Central Committee Advisory Group for Culture\".

He was also active in a multitude of cultural and scientific organizations and associations. His commitment to culture was assessed by his biographers as follows:\n\"He was probably a member of all commissions, teams and committees in Bydgoszcz, if they had any connection with cultural matters. [...] He was almost a cultural institution by himself [...].\"\nMarian Turwid died unexpectedly of a &lt;a href=\"Myocardial%20infarction\"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; on 17 November 1987.
