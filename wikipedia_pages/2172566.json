    "title": "Year Zero (political notion)",
    "text": "Year Zero (, ) is an idea put into practice by &lt;a href=\"Pol%20Pot\"&gt;Pol Pot&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Kampuchea\"&gt;Democratic Kampuchea&lt;/a&gt;, that all &lt;a href=\"culture\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tradition\"&gt;traditions&lt;/a&gt; within a society must be completely destroyed or discarded, and a new revolutionary culture must replace it, starting from scratch. In this sense, all of the history of a nation or a people before Year Zero would be largely deemed irrelevant, because it would ideally be purged and replaced from the ground up.\nThe first day of \"year Zero\" was declared by the &lt;a href=\"Khmer%20Rouge\"&gt;Khmer Rouge&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"1975%20in%20Cambodia%23April\"&gt;17 April 1975&lt;/a&gt; upon their takeover of &lt;a href=\"Cambodia\"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt; in order to signify a rebirth of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Cambodia\"&gt;Cambodian history&lt;/a&gt;. Adopting the term as an analogy to the \"&lt;a href=\"Year%20One\"&gt;Year One&lt;/a&gt;\" of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolutionary%20Calendar\"&gt;French Revolutionary Calendar&lt;/a&gt;, Year Zero was effectually an attempt by the Khmer Rouge to erase history and reset Cambodian society to a zeroth year, removing any vestiges of the past.\nConcept and background.\nPol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, most of whom were French-educated communists, took inspiration from the concept of \"&lt;a href=\"Year%20One\"&gt;Year One&lt;/a&gt;\" in the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolutionary%20Calendar\"&gt;French Revolutionary Calendar&lt;/a&gt;. The French \"Year One\" came about during the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt; when, after the &lt;a href=\"Proclamation%20of%20the%20abolition%20of%20the%20monarchy\"&gt;abolition of the French monarchy&lt;/a&gt; on 20 September 1792, the &lt;a href=\"French%20National%20Convention\"&gt;National Convention&lt;/a&gt; instituted a new calendar and declared that date to be the beginning of Year I.\nThe idea behind Year Zero was that all &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Cambodia\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; and traditions within a society must be completely destroyed or discarded, and a new revolutionary culture must replace it, starting from scratch. All of the history of a nation or people before Year Zero would be largely deemed irrelevant, because it would ideally be purged and replaced from the ground up.\nYear Zero of Cambodia.\nIn 1975, the &lt;a href=\"Khmer%20Rouge\"&gt;Khmer Rouge&lt;/a&gt; forces &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Phnom%20Penh\"&gt;took over Phnom Penh&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href=\"Cambodia\"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt; (subsequently renamed &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Kampuchea\"&gt;Democratic Kampuchea&lt;/a&gt;, 1975-79). Upon seizing power, Year Zero was decreed.\nHoping to transform the nation into an &lt;a href=\"Agrarian%20utopianism\"&gt;agrarian utopia&lt;/a&gt;, communist leader &lt;a href=\"Pol%20Pot\"&gt;Pol Pot&lt;/a&gt; set out to reconstruct the country into a &lt;a href=\"Pre-industrial%20society\"&gt;pre-industrial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"classless%20society\"&gt;classless society&lt;/a&gt; by attempting to turn all citizens into rural agricultural workers rather than educated city dwellers, whom Pot and his regime believed to have been corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Capitalism\"&gt;capitalist&lt;/a&gt; ideas. He declared that the nation would start again at \"Year Zero,\" and everything that existed before Year Zero was to be eradicated. In other words, this was to be a complete and thorough reset (or even cleansing) of Cambodian society. He isolated his people from the global community; established rural &lt;a href=\"Collective%20farming\"&gt;collectives&lt;/a&gt;; dismantled the &lt;a href=\"social%20fabric\"&gt;social fabric&lt;/a&gt; and infrastructure of Cambodia; and set about the emptying of cities, as well as the abolition of money (thus also destroying banks), &lt;a href=\"Abolition%20of%20private%20property\"&gt;private property&lt;/a&gt;, families, and of &lt;a href=\"Religion%20in%20Cambodia\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo build the new Cambodian society, the inhabitants of the depopulated cities were sent to &lt;a href=\"Labor%20camp\"&gt;labour camps&lt;/a&gt;. The people of &lt;a href=\"Phnom%20Penh\"&gt;Phnom Penh&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, were forced immediately to \"return to the villages\" to work. Similar evacuations occurred at &lt;a href=\"Battambang\"&gt;Batdambang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kampong%20Cham%20%28city%29\"&gt;Kampong Cham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siem%20Reap\"&gt;Siem Reap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kampong%20Thom%20city\"&gt;Kampong Thom&lt;/a&gt;, among others.\nKnowledge of anything pre-Year Zero was prohibited. To ensure that there was no recorded memory of a pre-Year Zero society, books were burned. (Wearing glasses was also criminalized as it was taken to indicate that one might habitually read books.) In Democratic Kampuchea, the only acceptable lifestyle was that of peasant agricultural workers. Centuries of Cambodian culture and institutions were thereby eliminated\u2014shutting down factories, hospitals, schools, and universities\u2014along with anyone who expressed interest in their preservation. So-called &lt;a href=\"New%20People%20%28Cambodia%29\"&gt;New People&lt;/a&gt;\u2014members of the old governments and intellectuals in general, including lawyers, doctors, teachers, engineers, clergy, and qualified professionals in all fields\u2014were thought to be a threat to the new regime and were therefore especially &lt;a href=\"Cambodian%20genocide\"&gt;singled out and executed during the purges&lt;/a&gt; accompanying Year Zero.\nThe Khmer Rouge's takeover was rapidly followed by a series of drastic revolutionary &lt;a href=\"de-industrialization\"&gt;de-industrialization&lt;/a&gt; policies which resulted in a &lt;a href=\"Khmer%20Rouge%20rule%20of%20Cambodia\"&gt;death toll&lt;/a&gt; that vastly exceeded the toll that resulted from the French &lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Reign of Terror&lt;/a&gt;."
