She again was recommissioned on or about 1 September 1939.\nOn 11 October 1940, \"I-66\" took part along with 97 other Japanese warships and 527 Japanese naval aircraft in an Imperial Naval Review in &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Bay\"&gt;Tokyo Bay&lt;/a&gt;. A little over a year later, early on the morning of 21 October 1941, she collided with the submarine in &lt;a href=\"Saeki%20Bay\"&gt;Saeki Bay&lt;/a&gt; during naval maneuvers. Both submarines suffered only light damage.\nAs the Imperial Japanese Navy began to deploy in preparation for the impending &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20War\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt;, \"I-66\" \u2014 which together with made up Submarine Division 30, a part of Submarine &lt;a href=\"Squadron%20%28naval%29\"&gt;Squadron&lt;/a&gt; 5 \u2014 departed Sasebo on 26 November 1941 bound for &lt;a href=\"Palau\"&gt;Palau&lt;/a&gt; along with the rest of Submarine Squadron 5, namely \"I-65\", the submarines of Submarine Division 29, and the squadron's &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"light%20cruiser\"&gt;light cruiser&lt;/a&gt; .

The two submarines received a warning that &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; submarines were operating off Kuching. While preparing to surface to recharge her batteries northwest of Kuching on 24 December 1941, \"I-66\" sighted the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Netherlands%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Netherlands Navy&lt;/a&gt; submarine on the surface on her &lt;a href=\"Port%20and%20starboard\"&gt;starboard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; at a range of .
