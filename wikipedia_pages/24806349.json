Its habitat includes &lt;a href=\"subalpine\"&gt;subalpine&lt;/a&gt; mountain forests and &lt;a href=\"alpine%20zone\"&gt;alpine&lt;/a&gt; rock fields.\nAlthough the plant is rare, it is not likely to experience disturbance or destruction because it lives in such remote habitat.\nDescription.\n\"Monardella beneolens\" is a hairy, glandular &lt;a href=\"rhizome\"&gt;rhizomatous&lt;/a&gt; perennial herb growing in a mat or small tuft and producing flowering stems 10 to 30 centimeters long. The long-haired, triangular or oval leaves are under a centimeter long and usually wavy along the edges. The &lt;a href=\"inflorescence\"&gt;inflorescence&lt;/a&gt; is a head of several flowers blooming in a cup of pinkish or pale green &lt;a href=\"bract\"&gt;bract&lt;/a&gt;s.
