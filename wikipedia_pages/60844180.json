    "text": "Khwarrahbud was a 4th-century &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20people\"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; scribe (\"&lt;a href=\"dabir\"&gt;dabir&lt;/a&gt;\") active during the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Sasanian&lt;/a&gt; king (&lt;a href=\"shah\"&gt;shah&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Shapur%20II\"&gt;Shapur II&lt;/a&gt; (). Attested in Armenian as \"Khor\u014dhbowt\", Khwarrahbud was captured during Shapur II's wars against the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Romans&lt;/a&gt;. During his stay in Roman territory, Khwarrahbud learned &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; and wrote a book on the accomplishments of Shapur II and &lt;a href=\"Julian%20%28emperor%29\"&gt;Julian&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, Khwarrahbud also later translated into Greek a &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Persian\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; book written by R\u0101stsakhwan (attested in Armenian as \"Rastsohown\"), one of his captive associates. The book was later used by the 6th-century historian &lt;a href=\"Agathias\"&gt;Agathias&lt;/a&gt;."
