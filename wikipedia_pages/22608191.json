    "text": "By Common Consent (BCC) is a &lt;a href=\"Blog%23Types\"&gt;group blog&lt;/a&gt; featuring commentary and discussion especially of &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints\"&gt;Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"thought\"&gt;thought&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"current%20events\"&gt;current events&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded in 2004, and is one of several blogs in the group known as the Mormon &lt;a href=\"Bloggernacle\"&gt;Bloggernacle&lt;/a&gt;. According to the blog's mission statement, BCC was founded \"to provide a thoughtful, enjoyable, and reasonable place to post and discuss Mormon topics.\"\nName.\nThe blog takes its name from an 1830 revelation given to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints founder &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Smith\"&gt;Joseph Smith&lt;/a&gt; which instructed that \"all things shall be done by common consent in the church, by much prayer and faith, for all things you shall receive by faith.\" This statement is now canonized as &lt;a href=\"Doctrine%20and%20Covenants\"&gt;Doctrine and Covenants&lt;/a&gt; 26:2 of &lt;a href=\"The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints\"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough \"By Common Consent\" was used immediately as a working title for the blog, readers were asked to give suggestions on a permanent name. Suggested names included \"The &lt;a href=\"Rameumptom\"&gt;Rameumptom&lt;/a&gt;\" (the original &lt;a href=\"URL\"&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; for the blog was rameumptom.blogspot.com before moving to its present URL), \"&lt;a href=\"Zeezrom\"&gt;Zeezrom&lt;/a&gt;, Esq.\" (an homage to the heavy presence of legal professionals in the Mormon blogging community), \"&lt;a href=\"Curelom\"&gt;Curelom&lt;/a&gt;s &amp; Cumoms\", \"By the Regular Sign\" (a reference to the custom in the LDS Church to show support for a given proposition by raising the right hand), \"Fifth Nephi\" (a reference to the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Mormon\"&gt;Book of Mormon's&lt;/a&gt; four &lt;a href=\"Plates%20of%20Nephi\"&gt;books of Nephi&lt;/a&gt;, \"Times &amp; Seasons 2\" (at the time BCC was established, Times &amp; Seasons was the dominant Mormon blog), and \"Pay On Gross\" (a reference to a common debate among Mormons about whether &lt;a href=\"tithes\"&gt;tithes&lt;/a&gt; should be paid on net or gross income).\nContent and style.\nAlthough By Common Consent was originally created to provide a place for more politically liberal members of the LDS Church to discuss issues, a vast majority of the content found on BCC is not political in nature. Post topics frequently address practical application of tenets of the LDS faith, Mormon history, analysis of ancient and modern scripture, poetry, music, humor, and current events.\nNew contributions to the blog are posted daily by the \"permas\" with frequent additional posts provided by guest bloggers. Comments from readers are supported, and while a majority of participants in comment discussions are adherents to the LDS Church, the blog aims to maintain an environment conducive to respectful interfaith dialogue. The blog includes articles and discussions, with scholarly research, satire, devotionals, and humor.\nRecurring features.\nSince 2004, BCC has introduced several recurring features (* denotes series that is still active):\n\"A friend reminded me of those old commercials featuring a close play in an &lt;a href=\"NFL\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; game, with the tag line \"You make the call!\". The idea was for the TV viewer to pretend he is the referee and call the play how he sees it, and then compare the actual call the referee made in the game. So, in that spirit...this is a game where we examine a close play, and in the comments section of this blog, presumably without the benefit of guidance by &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Ghost\"&gt;the Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, we state our case for the call the official should make.\"\nContributors.\nOver the years, By Common Consent has featured a number of authors from the Latter-day Saint community. The contributors to the blog come from backgrounds including &lt;a href=\"homemaking\"&gt;homemaking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"history\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"social%20sciences\"&gt;social sciences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"humanities\"&gt;humanities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fine%20art\"&gt;fine art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"biology\"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chemistry\"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"computer%20science\"&gt;computer science&lt;/a&gt;, among others. Religiously, the contributors represent \"a varied swath of their lived religion,\" with different approaches to faith, doctrine, and religious living. Additionally, several of the contributors write for other online or print publications on topics such as literature, politics, pop culture, and science.\n the asterisk (*) denotes\u2009original authors.\nCurrent ().\nBrad Kramer\nJ. Stapley\nGuests.\nBCC also features content produced by guest authors from the Latter-day Saints community, including the LDS sociologist &lt;a href=\"Armand%20L.%20Mauss\"&gt;Armand L. Mauss&lt;/a&gt;, LDS Biographer &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20A.%20Prince\"&gt;Gregory A. Prince&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"parenting\"&gt;parenting&lt;/a&gt; author &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Eyre%20%28author%29\"&gt;Richard Eyre&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, By Common Consent periodically posts interviews with members of the LDS community, including an interview with comedian and author &lt;a href=\"Elna%20Baker\"&gt;Elna Baker&lt;/a&gt;, and an interview with &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Otterson\"&gt;Michael Otterson&lt;/a&gt;, the Managing Director of Public Affairs for the LDS Church.\nAwards.\nSince the initiation of the Bloggernacle\u2019s annual \"&lt;a href=\"Niblet\"&gt;Niblet&lt;/a&gt;\" awards in 2005, BCC has consistently won the award for \"Best Big Blog.\" In 2009, BCC authors won the Niblets in the categories of \"Best Overall Blogger,\" \"Funniest Thread,\" \"Best Humorous Post,\" \"Best Historical Post,\" \"Best Personal Post,\" \"Best Doctrinal Post,\" \"Best Current Events Post,\" \"Best Podcast,\" \"Best Book/Article Review,\" and \"Best Contribution to the Bloggernacle.\"\nAlliance with \"Dialogue\".\nSeveral of the blog's long-term guest contributors are also editors or board members of \"\". Kristine Haglund, one of BCC's permabloggers, is currently the Editor in Chief of \"Dialogue\", while Ronan JH and Steven Peck, two other permabloggers, serve as \"Dialogue\" editors, and other current and former permabloggers contribute to the \"Dialogue\" editorial board.\nBCC Press.\nThe editors at By Common Consent inaugurated the non-profit book publisher BCC Press in April 2017, with the intent to publish books of Mormon-themed \"philosophy, theology, history, scriptural exegesis, fiction, poetry, personal essays, and memoirs.\" Serving as president of the press is Steve Evans, attorney and popular &lt;a href=\"Mormon%20blogger\"&gt;Mormon blogger&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"BCC Zeitcast\".\nBy Common Consent is also the home of the \"BCC Zeitcast\", one of the &lt;a href=\"Bloggernacle\"&gt;Bloggernacle&lt;/a&gt;'s few &lt;a href=\"podcasts\"&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, the \"BCC Zeitcast\" is approximately 30 minutes in length, and takes the form of a &lt;a href=\"talk%20radio\"&gt;talk radio&lt;/a&gt;, with anywhere from two to five contributors participating in a given episode. The podcast consists of a free flowing conversation on Bloggernacle meta-topics, popular culture, current events, religious topics, or news from the world of &lt;a href=\"Mormonism\"&gt;Mormonism&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first \"BCC Zeitcast\" was posted on January 11, 2007, with subsequent episodes recorded and posted semi-regularly until Spring 2009. During this period, the primary contributors were permabloggers from BCC such as Steve Evans, Ronan JH, Amri Brown, and Brad Kramer, but would occasionally feature guests. The \"BCC Zeitcast\" returned in December 2009, with largely new permabloggers contributing to the new season."
