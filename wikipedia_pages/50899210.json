    "text": "Giovanni Filippo Apolloni (1620 \u2013 15 May 1688) was an Italian poet and librettist. Born in &lt;a href=\"Arezzo\"&gt;Arezzo&lt;/a&gt;, he has sometimes been referred to as \"Giovanni Apollonio Apolloni\", but the second given name is spurious. He served as the court poet to &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Charles%2C%20Archduke%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Austria&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Innsbruck\"&gt;Innsbruck&lt;/a&gt; form 1653 until 1659. On his return to Italy he entered the service of Cardinal Volumnio Bandinelli. After Bandinelli's death in 1667 Appolloni was in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Chigi%20family\"&gt;Chigi family&lt;/a&gt; in Rome and Siena for the rest of his life. He wrote the librettos for a number of operas, the most well-known of which were &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Cesti\"&gt;Antonio Cesti&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"L%27Argia\"&gt;L'Argia&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Dori\"&gt;La Dori&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as several oratorios and the texts for &lt;a href=\"cantata\"&gt;cantata&lt;/a&gt;s by both Cesti and &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Stradella\"&gt;Alessandro Stradella&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nApolloni was born in &lt;a href=\"Arezzo\"&gt;Arezzo&lt;/a&gt; to a family prominent in the city's history. Little is known about his early life, but according to Carolyn Gianturco in her biography of Alessandro Stradella, Apolloni had been a &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; before turning to poetry. In the 1640s he was a member of Accademia dei Percossi in Florence. Founded by &lt;a href=\"Salvator%20Rosa\"&gt;Salvator Rosa&lt;/a&gt;, its members were composed of the intellectual and artistic elite of the city and included &lt;a href=\"Giacinto%20Andrea%20Cicognini\"&gt;Giacinto Andrea Cicognini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Cesti\"&gt;Antonio Cesti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Abati\"&gt;Antonio Abati&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lorenzo%20Lippi\"&gt;Lorenzo Lippi&lt;/a&gt;. In 1653, on the recommendation of Rosa's patron Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Giancarlo%20de%27%20Medici\"&gt;Giancarlo de' Medici&lt;/a&gt;, Apolloni was appointed court poet to &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Charles%2C%20Archduke%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Austria&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Innsbruck\"&gt;Innsbruck&lt;/a&gt;. There he produced the libretti for three works by Antonio Cesti: the operas \"&lt;a href=\"L%27Argia\"&gt;L'Argia&lt;/a&gt;\" (1655) and \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Dori\"&gt;La Dori&lt;/a&gt;\" (1657) and the courtly entertainment \"Mars und Adonis\" (1655). Both \"L'Argia\" and \"Mars und Adonis\" were performed during the week-long celebrations in November 1655 welcoming &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Christina%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Queen Christina of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; on her journey to Rome. For Cesti's opera \"&lt;a href=\"Orontea\"&gt;Orontea&lt;/a&gt;\", performed in Innsbruck in 1656, Apolloni revised the original libretto by Cicognini and wrote a new prologue involving a debate between Philosophy and Love.\nIn 1659 Apolloni returned to Italy and shortly thereafter entered the service of Cardinal Volumnio Bandinelli (1598\u20131667) who had been a fellow member of the Accademia dei Percossi. After the death of Bandinelli, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Chigi%20Family\"&gt;Chigi&lt;/a&gt; household in Rome, working first for Cardinal and then for Sigismondo's cousin Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Flavio%20Chigi%20%281631%E2%80%931693%29\"&gt;Flavio Chigi&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Colonna\"&gt;Colonna&lt;/a&gt; and Chigi families, who both had residences in the Piazza dei Santi Apostoli in Rome, had close social, political, and cultural ties with each other. They jointly sponsored the creation of several operas with libretti by Apolloni, including \"L'Alcasta\" composed by &lt;a href=\"Bernardo%20Pasquini\"&gt;Bernardo Pasquini&lt;/a&gt; and dedicated to Queen Christina. It was through this extended network that Apolloni also began working with Alessandro Stradella. In 1672 Flavio and Agostino Chigi formed the Accademia degli Sfaccendati (Academy of the Idlers). Its members were their close associates and all shared an interest in the theatre. They included Apolloni, Queen Christina (patron of the &lt;a href=\"Tor%20di%20Nona\"&gt;Teatro Tordinona&lt;/a&gt; in Rome), &lt;a href=\"Filippo%20Acciaiuoli\"&gt;Filippo Acciaiuoli&lt;/a&gt; (the Tordinona's impresario), Giuliano Capranica whose family ran the &lt;a href=\"Teatro%20Capranica\"&gt;Teatro Capranica&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Capizucchi%20family\"&gt;Alessandro Capizucchi&lt;/a&gt;. The express purpose of the Sfaccendati was to produce operas to be performed at the Chigi palazzo in &lt;a href=\"Ariccia\"&gt;Ariccia&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts of Rome. Apolloni and Acciaiuoli co-authored the librettos for two operas which were performed there, \"Il Tirinto\" and \"L'Adalinda\". However the high cost of producing operas so far from the center of Rome made \"L'Adalinda\" the last of these \"country house operas\". The last opera for which Apolloni wrote the libretto was \"La forza d'amore\" composed by Bernardo Pasquini. A slight pastoral work with only three characters, it was performed in Florence at the &lt;a href=\"Villa%20di%20Pratolino\"&gt;Villa di Pratolino&lt;/a&gt; in 1679.\nApolloni stayed in the service of the Chigi family until his death in 1688. His most enduring works remain the two Innsbruck operas he wrote for Antonio Cesti in the 1650s\u2014\"La Dori\" and \"L'Argia\". Convoluted semi-comic tales of multiple disguises and mistaken identities, both of them were immensely popular in their day with multiple productions in Italy during Apolloni's lifetime. \"L'Argia\" had its first performance in modern times at the &lt;a href=\"Innsbruck%20Festival%20of%20Early%20Music\"&gt;Innsbruck Festival of Early Music&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 with subsequent performances in Lausanne and Paris. \"La Dori\" has been revived several times in the 20th century, including productions in 1983 at the &lt;a href=\"Spitalfields%20Festival\"&gt;Spitalfields Festival&lt;/a&gt; in London, 1990 at the &lt;a href=\"Mannes%20College%20of%20Music\"&gt;Mannes College of Music&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and 1999 at the Cittadella Musicale in Arezzo."
