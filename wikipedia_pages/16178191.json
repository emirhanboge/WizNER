    "text": "A run, straight or sequence is a combination of &lt;a href=\"playing%20cards\"&gt;playing cards&lt;/a&gt; where cards have consecutive rank values. They need not normally be of the same suit. However, if they are, this is referred to as a suit sequence. Some games, such as &lt;a href=\"cribbage\"&gt;cribbage&lt;/a&gt;, specify that an ace counts as one (\"ace low\"); others specify that an ace counts above a King (\"ace high\"); yet others, such as &lt;a href=\"poker\"&gt;poker&lt;/a&gt;, allow an ace to count either high or low.\nRuns are one of the two types of &lt;a href=\"meld%20%28cards%29\"&gt;meld&lt;/a&gt; that may be used in games where melding is part of the play; the other being a &lt;a href=\"set%20%28cards%29\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; or group, such as a pair or triplet.\nA natural sequence, as opposed to one that is wild, is one that consists purely of 'natural cards', without any &lt;a href=\"wild%20card%20%28playing%20card%29\"&gt;wild cards&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Joker%20%28playing%20card%29\"&gt;jokers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Deuce%20%28playing%20card%29\"&gt;deuces&lt;/a&gt;."
