    "text": "The 2019 Bill Beaumont County Championship Division 2 was the 18th version of the competition that is part of the annual &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"County%20Championship%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;County Championship&lt;/a&gt; organised by the &lt;a href=\"RFU\"&gt;RFU&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Beaumont%20County%20Championship%20Division%202\"&gt;tier 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"English%20counties\"&gt;English counties&lt;/a&gt;. Each county drew its players from rugby union clubs from the third tier and below of the &lt;a href=\"English%20rugby%20union%20system\"&gt;English rugby union league system&lt;/a&gt; (typically &lt;a href=\"National%20League%201\"&gt;National League 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"National%20League%202%20North\"&gt;National League 2 North&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"National%20League%202%20South\"&gt;National League 2 South&lt;/a&gt;). The counties were divided into two regional sections with the winners of each meeting in the final held at &lt;a href=\"Twickenham%20Stadium\"&gt;Twickenham Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. \nAt the end of the group stage, &lt;a href=\"Leicestershire%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Leicestershire&lt;/a&gt; were dominant in Pool 1, winning all three games (albeit one which was a walkover), including an impressive win against a strong &lt;a href=\"East%20Midlands%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;East Midlands&lt;/a&gt; side, while &lt;a href=\"Surrey%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt; were equally impressive in topping Pool 2, also winning three out of three. In the final, Leicestershire finished as convincing winners with an emphatic 38 \u2013 13 victory over Surrey, in what was their second division title in three years.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format is two regional group stages divided into north and south with four teams in each group. This means that two teams in the pool had two home games, while the other two had just one. The RFU have taken fixtures from the previous year into account so that county sides that only played one home game in that competition now get two games and vice versa. At the end of the group stage the top teams with the best record from each group (north and south) advance to the final held on 2 June 2019 at &lt;a href=\"Twickenham%20Stadium\"&gt;Twickenham Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nPromotion and relegation occurs every two seasons, with accumulated points taken into consideration. At the end of the 2017\u201318 season, &lt;a href=\"Durham%20County%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Durham&lt;/a&gt; (north) and &lt;a href=\"Hampshire%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; (south) were promoted to &lt;a href=\"County%20Championship%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Division 1&lt;/a&gt;, replacing &lt;a href=\"East%20Midlands%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;East Midlands&lt;/a&gt; (north) and &lt;a href=\"Surrey%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt; (south) who dropped down into Division 2. &lt;a href=\"Cumbria%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Cumbria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Midlands%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;North Midlands&lt;/a&gt; were relegated into &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Beaumont%20County%20Championship%20Division%203\"&gt;Division 3&lt;/a&gt;, being replaced by promoted sides, &lt;a href=\"Essex%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sussex%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Sussex&lt;/a&gt;. There will now be no promotion or relegation until the end of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Bill%20Beaumont%20County%20Championship%20Division%202\"&gt;2020 competition&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompetition records.\nTeam.\n47 \u2013 3 Sussex at home to Essex on 11 May 2019\n78 \u2013 0 Leicestershire away to Warwickshire on 11 May 2019 \n78 \u2013 0 Leicestershire away to Warwickshire on 11 May 2019 \nLeicestershire away to Warwickshire on 11 May 2019 \nLeicestershire away to Warwickshire on 11 May 2019 \nEast Midlands at home to Warwickshire on 4 May 2019 \nWarwickshire away to East Midlands on 4 May 2019\nPlayer.\n &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Wilson%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Joe Wilson&lt;/a&gt; for Leicestershire away to Warwickshire on 11 May 2019\nMultiple players\n &lt;a href=\"Carlie%20Carter\"&gt;Carlie Carter&lt;/a&gt; for Somerset at home to Sussex on 18 May 2019\n &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Reed%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Charlie Reed&lt;/a&gt; for East Midlands at home to Warwickshire on 4 May 2019 \n &lt;a href=\"Dan%20O%27Brien%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Dan O'Brien&lt;/a&gt; for Warwickshire away to East Midlands on 4 May 2019"
