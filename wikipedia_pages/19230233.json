    "text": "The European Commission of the Nobility () is an organisation for cooperation of associations of &lt;a href=\"European%20nobility\"&gt;European nobility&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1959. Its seat is in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe CILANE has no &lt;a href=\"president%20%28corporate%20title%29\"&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; but rather a \"Coordinator\", elected for three years. The coordinator's role is to prepare and conduct the spring and autumn sessions of the CILANE and to carry out its decisions, enabling each national association to carry out projects together. It holds an international &lt;a href=\"congress\"&gt;congress&lt;/a&gt; every three years.\nThe spring session takes place traditionally in Paris, the seat of the CILANE. In autumn the sessions are held in one of the other member countries. Significantly, most of the organisations represented in CILANE are private initiatives, particularly in nations where &lt;a href=\"titles%20of%20nobility\"&gt;titles of nobility&lt;/a&gt; are no longer recognised by their respective states and therefore unregulated by &lt;a href=\"European%20law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;.\nList of member associations with external links.\nThe delegates represent their nobility associations at the CILANE for the following countries:"
