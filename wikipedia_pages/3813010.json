    "text": "Swaminarayan (&lt;a href=\"IAST\"&gt;IAST&lt;/a&gt;: ', 3 April 1781\u00a0\u2013 1 June 1830), also known as Sahajanand Swami\"', was a &lt;a href=\"yogi\"&gt;yogi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asceticism\"&gt;ascetic&lt;/a&gt; around whom the &lt;a href=\"Swaminarayan%20Sampradaya\"&gt;Swaminarayan Sampradaya&lt;/a&gt; developed, and whose life and teachings brought a revival of central Hindu practices of \"&lt;a href=\"dharma\"&gt;dharma&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"ahimsa\"&gt;ahimsa&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"brahmacarya\"&gt;brahmacarya&lt;/a&gt;\". He is believed by followers to be a manifestation of &lt;a href=\"God%20in%20Hinduism\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;.\nSwaminarayan was born Ghanshyam Pande in &lt;a href=\"Chhapaiya\"&gt;Chhapaiya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; in 1781. In 1792, he began a 7-year pilgrimage across India at the age of 11 years, adopting the name Nilkanth Varni. During this journey, he did welfare activities and after 9 years and 11 months of this journey, he settled in the modern-day Indian state of &lt;a href=\"Gujarat\"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt; around 1799. In 1800, he was initiated into the \"Uddhav\" \"&lt;a href=\"sampradaya\"&gt;sampradaya&lt;/a&gt;\" by his guru, &lt;a href=\"Swami%20Ramanand\"&gt;Swami Ramanand&lt;/a&gt;, and was given the name Sahajanand Swami. In 1802, his guru handed over the leadership of the Uddhav Sampraday to him before his death. Sahajanand Swami held a gathering and taught the &lt;a href=\"Swaminarayan%20Mantra\"&gt;Swaminarayan Mantra&lt;/a&gt;. From this point onwards, he was known as Swaminarayan. The Uddhav Sampraday became known as the &lt;a href=\"Swaminarayan%20Sampradaya\"&gt;Swaminarayan Sampradaya&lt;/a&gt;.\nSwaminarayan developed a good relationship with the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British Raj&lt;/a&gt;. He had followers not only from Hindu denominations but also from &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zoroastrianism\"&gt;Zoroastrianism&lt;/a&gt;. He built six temples in his lifetime and appointed 500 &lt;a href=\"paramahamsa\"&gt;paramahamsa&lt;/a&gt;s to spread his philosophy. In 1826, Swaminarayan wrote the \"&lt;a href=\"Shikshapatri\"&gt;Shikshapatri&lt;/a&gt;\", a book of social principles. He died on 1 June 1830 and was cremated according to Hindu rites in &lt;a href=\"Gadhada\"&gt;Gadhada&lt;/a&gt;, Gujarat. Before his death, Swaminarayan appointed his adopted nephews as &lt;a href=\"acharya\"&gt;acharya&lt;/a&gt;s to head the two dioceses of Swaminarayan Sampradaya. Swaminarayan is also remembered within the sect for undertaking reforms for women and the poor, and performing non-violent &lt;a href=\"yajna\"&gt;yaj\u00f1as&lt;/a&gt; (fire sacrifices) on a large scale.\nBiography.\nChildhood as Ghanshyam.\nSwaminarayan was born on 3 April 1781 (Chaitra Sud 9, Samvat 1837) in &lt;a href=\"Chhapaiya\"&gt;Chhapaiya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, a village near &lt;a href=\"Ayodhya\"&gt;Ayodhya&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt; speaking region in India. Born into the &lt;a href=\"brahmin\"&gt;brahmin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"caste%20system%20in%20India\"&gt;priestly caste&lt;/a&gt; of Sarvariya, Swaminarayan was named \"Ghanshyam Pande\" by his parents, Hariprasad Pande (father, also known as Dharmadev) and Premvati Pande (mother, also known as Bhaktimata and Murtidevi). The birth of Swaminarayan coincided with the Hindu festival of &lt;a href=\"Rama%20Navami\"&gt;Rama Navami&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating the birth of &lt;a href=\"Rama\"&gt;Rama&lt;/a&gt;. The ninth lunar day in the fortnight of the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20phase\"&gt;waxing moon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20calendar\"&gt;month&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chaitra\"&gt;Chaitra&lt;/a&gt; (March\u2013April), is celebrated as both Rama Navami and &lt;a href=\"Swaminarayan%20Jayanti\"&gt;Swaminarayan Jayanti&lt;/a&gt; by Swaminarayan followers. This celebration also marks the beginning of a ritual calendar for the followers.\nA Swaminarayan sectarian legend tells how Narayana from the &lt;a href=\"Nara%20Narayana\"&gt;Nara Narayana&lt;/a&gt; pair, was cursed by sage &lt;a href=\"Durvasa\"&gt;Durvasa&lt;/a&gt; to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan.\nSwaminarayan had an elder brother, Rampratap Pande, and a younger brother, Ichcharam Pande. He is said to have mastered the &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20texts\"&gt;scriptures&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Vedas\"&gt;Vedas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Upanishads\"&gt;Upanishads&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Puranas\"&gt;Puranas&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Ramayana\"&gt;Ramayana&lt;/a&gt;\", and the \"&lt;a href=\"Mahabharata\"&gt;Mahabharata&lt;/a&gt;\" by the age of seven.\nTravels as Nilkanth Varni.\nAfter the death of his parents, Ghanshyam Pande left his home on 29 June 1792 (Ashadh Sud 10, Samvat 1849) at the age of 11. He took the name Nilkanth Varni while on his journey. Nilkanth Varni travelled across India and parts of &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; in search of an &lt;a href=\"ashram\"&gt;ashram&lt;/a&gt;, or hermitage, that practiced what he considered a correct understanding of &lt;a href=\"Vedanta\"&gt;Vedanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samkhya\"&gt;Samkhya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yoga\"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pancaratra\"&gt;Pancaratra&lt;/a&gt;, the four primary schools of Hindu philosophy. To find such an ashram, Nilkanth Varni asked the following five questions on the basic Vaishnava Vedanta categories:\nWhile on his journey, Nilkanth Varni mastered \"&lt;a href=\"Raja%20Yoga\"&gt;Astanga yoga&lt;/a&gt;\" (eightfold yoga) in a span of nine months under the guidance of an aged yogic master named Gopal Yogi. In Nepal, it is said that he met King &lt;a href=\"Rana%20Bahadur%20Shah\"&gt;Rana Bahadur Shah&lt;/a&gt; and cured him of his stomach illness. As a result, the king freed all the ascetics he had imprisoned. Nilkanth Varni visited the &lt;a href=\"Jagannath%20Temple%20%28Puri%29\"&gt;Jagannath Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Puri\"&gt;Puri&lt;/a&gt; as well as temples in &lt;a href=\"Badrinath\"&gt;Badrinath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rameswaram\"&gt;Rameswaram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nashik\"&gt;Nashik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarka\"&gt;Dwarka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandharpur\"&gt;Pandharpur&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1799, after a seven-year journey, Nilkanth's travels as a &lt;a href=\"yogi\"&gt;yogi&lt;/a&gt; eventually concluded in Loj, a village in the &lt;a href=\"Junagadh%20district\"&gt;Junagadh district&lt;/a&gt; of Gujarat. In Loj, Nilkanth Varni met &lt;a href=\"Muktanand%20Swami\"&gt;Muktanand Swami&lt;/a&gt;, a senior disciple of &lt;a href=\"Ramanand%20Swami\"&gt;Ramanand Swami&lt;/a&gt;. Muktanand Swami, who was 22 years older than Nilkanth, answered the 5 questions to Nilkanth's satisfaction. Nilkanth decided to stay for the opportunity to meet Ramanand Swami, whom he met a few months after his arrival in Gujarat. He later claimed in the &lt;a href=\"Vachnamrut\"&gt;Vachnamrut&lt;/a&gt; that during this period, he took up a severe penance to eliminate his mother's flesh and blood from his body so that the sign of his physical attachment to family, was completely removed.\nLeadership as Sahajanand Swami.\nAccording to the sect, Nilkanth's understanding of the &lt;a href=\"metaphysical\"&gt;metaphysical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"epistemological\"&gt;epistemological&lt;/a&gt; concepts of the \"&lt;a href=\"Mah%C4%81bh%C5%ABta\"&gt;pancha-tattvas&lt;/a&gt;\" (five eternal elements), together with his mental and physical discipline, inspired senior swamis of Ramanand Swami.\nNilkanth Varni received \"&lt;a href=\"sannyasa\"&gt;sannyasa&lt;/a&gt;\" initiation from Ramanand Swami on 20 October 1800, and with it was granted the names \"Sahajanand Swami\" and \"Narayan Muni\" to signify his new status.\nAt the age of 21, Sahajanand Swami was appointed successor to Ramanand Swami as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Uddhav%20Sampraday\"&gt;Uddhav Sampradaya&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ramanand%20Swami\"&gt;Ramanand Swami&lt;/a&gt;, prior to his death. The Uddhav Sampradaya henceforth came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Swaminarayan%20Sampraday\"&gt;Swaminarayan Sampradaya&lt;/a&gt;. According to sources he proclaimed the worship of one sole deity, &lt;a href=\"Krishna\"&gt;Krishna&lt;/a&gt; or Narayana. Krishna was considered by him his own &lt;a href=\"ista%20devata\"&gt;ista devata&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast with the &lt;a href=\"Vaishnava\"&gt;Vaishnava&lt;/a&gt; sect known as the &lt;a href=\"Radha-vallabha\"&gt;Radha-vallabha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sampradaya\"&gt;Sampradaya&lt;/a&gt;, he had a more puritanical approach, rather than the theological views of Krishna that are strongly capricious in character and imagery. While being a worshipper of Krishna, Swaminarayan rejected licentious elements in &lt;a href=\"Krishnology\"&gt;Krishnology&lt;/a&gt; in favor of worship in the mood of majesty, alike to earlier &lt;a href=\"Vaisnava\"&gt;Vaisnava&lt;/a&gt; teachers, &lt;a href=\"Ramanuja\"&gt;Ramanuja&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yamunacharya\"&gt;Yamunacharya&lt;/a&gt;.\nManifestation of God.\nAccording to Swaminarayan-tradition, Sahajanand Swami was later known as \"Swaminarayan\" after the &lt;a href=\"mantra\"&gt;mantra&lt;/a&gt; he taught at a gathering, in Faneni, a fortnight after the death of Ramanand Swami. He gave his followers a new mantra, known as the &lt;a href=\"Swaminarayan%20mantra\"&gt;Swaminarayan mantra&lt;/a&gt;, to repeat in their rituals: \"Swaminarayan\". When chanting this mantra, some devotees went into &lt;a href=\"samadhi\"&gt;samadhi&lt;/a&gt;, and claimed that they could see their personal gods. Swaminarayan also became known by the names Ghanshyam Maharaj, Shreeji Maharaj, Hari Krishna Maharaj and Shri Hari.\nAs early as 1804, Swaminarayan, who was reported to have performed miracles, was described as a manifestation of God in the first work written by a disciple and paramhansa, &lt;a href=\"Nishkulanand%20Swami\"&gt;Nishkulanand Swami&lt;/a&gt;. This work, the \"Yama Danda\", was the first piece of literature written within the Swaminarayan sect. Swaminarayan himself is said to have intimated that he was a manifestation of God in a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Heber\"&gt;Reginald Heber&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord &lt;a href=\"Bishop\"&gt;Bishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Calcutta\"&gt;Calcutta&lt;/a&gt;, in 1825.\nSome of Swaminarayan's followers believe he was an incarnation of Lord &lt;a href=\"Krishna\"&gt;Krishna&lt;/a&gt;. The images and stories of Swaminarayan and Krishna have coincided in the liturgy of the sect. The story of the birth of Swaminarayan parallels that of Krishna's birth from the scripture &lt;a href=\"Bhagavata%20Purana\"&gt;Bhagavata Purana&lt;/a&gt;. Most of his followers belief that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or &lt;a href=\"Purashottam\"&gt;Purushottam&lt;/a&gt; Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars. \nThe belief of many followers that their founder was the incarnation of the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his followers and dressed and traveled as a &lt;a href=\"Maharaja\"&gt;Maharaja&lt;/a&gt; even though he had taken the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.\nDharma.\nSwaminarayan encouraged his followers to combine devotion and &lt;a href=\"dharma\"&gt;dharma&lt;/a&gt; to lead a pious life. Using Hindu texts and rituals to form the base of his organisation, Swaminarayan founded what in later centuries would become a global organisation with strong &lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20people\"&gt;Gujarati&lt;/a&gt; roots. He was particularly strict on the separation of sexes in temples. Swaminarayan was against the consumption of meat, alcohol or drugs, adultery, suicide, animal sacrifices, criminal activities and the appeasement of ghosts and &lt;a href=\"Tantra\"&gt;tantric&lt;/a&gt; rituals. Alcohol consumption was forbidden by him even for medicinal purposes. Many of his followers took vows before becoming his disciple. He stated that four elements need to be conquered for ultimate salvation: dharma, &lt;a href=\"bhakti\"&gt;bhakti&lt;/a&gt; (devotion), &lt;a href=\"jnana\"&gt;gnana&lt;/a&gt; (knowledge) and &lt;a href=\"vairagya\"&gt;vairagya&lt;/a&gt; (detachment). Doctrinally, Swaminarayan was close to eleventh century philosopher &lt;a href=\"Ramanuja\"&gt;Ramanuja&lt;/a&gt; and was critical of &lt;a href=\"Shankaracharya\"&gt;Shankaracharya&lt;/a&gt;'s concept of &lt;a href=\"advaita\"&gt;advaita&lt;/a&gt;, or monistic &lt;a href=\"nondualism\"&gt;non-dualism&lt;/a&gt;. Swaminarayan's &lt;a href=\"ontology\"&gt;ontology&lt;/a&gt; maintained that the supreme being is not formless and that God always has a divine form.\nRelations with other religions and the British Government.\nSwaminarayan strived to maintain good relationships with people of other religions, sometimes meeting prominent leaders. His followers cut across religious boundaries, including people of &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parsi\"&gt;Parsi&lt;/a&gt; backgrounds. Swaminarayan's personal attendants included &lt;a href=\"Khoja\"&gt;Khoja&lt;/a&gt; Muslims. In &lt;a href=\"Kathiawad\"&gt;Kathiawad&lt;/a&gt;, many Muslims wore &lt;a href=\"Satsangi%23Kanthi\"&gt;kanthi&lt;/a&gt; necklaces given by Swaminarayan. He also had a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Heber\"&gt;Reginald Heber&lt;/a&gt;, Lord &lt;a href=\"Bishop\"&gt;Bishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Calcutta\"&gt;Calcutta&lt;/a&gt; and a leader of &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt; in India at the time. Bishop Heber mentions in his account of the meeting that about two hundred disciples of Swaminarayan accompanied him as his bodyguards mounted on horses and carrying &lt;a href=\"Matchlock\"&gt;Matchlock&lt;/a&gt;s and swords. Bishop Heber himself had about a hundred horse guards accompanying him (fifty horses and fifty muskets) and mentioned that it was humiliating for him to see two religious leaders meeting at the head of two small armies, his being the smaller contingent. As a result of the meeting, both leaders gained mutual respect for one another.\nSwaminarayan enjoyed a good relationship with the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British Imperial Government&lt;/a&gt;. The first temple he built, in &lt;a href=\"Ahmedabad\"&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt;, was built on of land given by the government. The British officers gave it a 101 gun salute when it was opened. It was in an 1825 meeting with Reginald Heber that Swaminarayan is said to have intimated that he was a manifestation of Krishna. In 1830, Swaminarayan had a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Sir%20John%20Malcolm\"&gt;Sir John Malcolm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Bombay\"&gt;Governor of Bombay&lt;/a&gt; (1827 to 1830). According to Malcolm, Swaminarayan had helped bring some stability to a lawless region. During the meeting with Malcolm, Swaminarayan gave him a copy of the Shikshapatri. This copy of the Shikshapatri is currently housed at the &lt;a href=\"Bodleian%20Library\"&gt;Bodleian Library&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;.\nTemples and ascetics.\nSwaminarayan ordered the construction of several &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20temple\"&gt;Hindu temple&lt;/a&gt;s and he had built six huge temples by himself and installed the idols of various deities such as &lt;a href=\"Radha%20Krishna\"&gt;Radha Krishna&lt;/a&gt; Dev, &lt;a href=\"Nara-Narayana\"&gt;Nara-Narayana&lt;/a&gt; Dev, &lt;a href=\"Laxminarayan%20Dev\"&gt;Laxminarayan Dev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gopinath%20%28god%29\"&gt;Gopinathji Maharaj&lt;/a&gt;, Radha Raman Dev and Madanmohan Lalji. The images in the temples built by Swaminarayan provide evidence of the priority of Krishna. Disciples of Swaminarayan composed devotional poems which are widely sung by the tradition during festivals. Swaminarayan introduced fasting and devotion among followers. He conducted the festivals of &lt;a href=\"Vasant%20Panchami\"&gt;Vasant Panchami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holi\"&gt;Holi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Krishna%20Janmashtami\"&gt;Janmashtami&lt;/a&gt; with organization of the traditional folk dance &lt;a href=\"Dandiya%20Raas\"&gt;raas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shri%20Swaminarayan%20Mandir%2C%20Ahmedabad\"&gt;first temple&lt;/a&gt; Swaminarayan constructed was in &lt;a href=\"Ahmedabad\"&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt; in 1822, with the land for construction given by the British Imperial Government. Following a request of devotees from &lt;a href=\"Bhuj\"&gt;Bhuj&lt;/a&gt;, Swaminarayan asked his follower Vaishnavananand to build a &lt;a href=\"Shri%20Swaminarayan%20Mandir%2C%20Bhuj\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; there. Construction commenced in 1822, and the temple was built within a year. A &lt;a href=\"Shri%20Swaminarayan%20Mandir%2C%20Vadtal\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vadtal\"&gt;Vadtal&lt;/a&gt; followed in 1824, a &lt;a href=\"Shri%20Swaminarayan%20Mandir%2C%20Dholera\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dholera\"&gt;Dholera&lt;/a&gt; in 1826, a &lt;a href=\"Shri%20Swaminarayan%20Mandir%2C%20Junagadh\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Junagadh\"&gt;Junagadh&lt;/a&gt; in 1828 and a &lt;a href=\"Shri%20Swaminarayan%20Mandir%2C%20Gadhada\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gadhada\"&gt;Gadhada&lt;/a&gt;, also in 1828. By the time of his death, Swaminarayan had also ordered construction of temples in &lt;a href=\"Muli%20%28India%29\"&gt;Muli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dholka\"&gt;Dholka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jetalpur\"&gt;Jetalpur&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom early on, ascetics have played a major role in the Swaminarayan sect. They contribute towards growth and development of the movement, encouraging people to follow a pious and religious life. Tradition maintains that Swaminarayan initiated 500 ascetics as \"&lt;a href=\"paramhansas\"&gt;paramhansas&lt;/a&gt;\" in a single night. Paramhansa is a title of honour sometimes applied to Hindu spiritual teachers who are regarded as having attained enlightenment. Paramhansas were the highest order of \"&lt;a href=\"sannyasi\"&gt;sannyasi&lt;/a&gt;\" in the sect. Prominent paramhansas included &lt;a href=\"Muktanand%20Swami\"&gt;Muktanand Swami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gopalanand%20Swami\"&gt;Gopalanand Swami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brahmanand%20Swami\"&gt;Brahmanand Swami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gunatitanand%20Swami\"&gt;Gunatitanand Swami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Premanand%20Swami\"&gt;Premanand Swami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nishkulanand%20Swami\"&gt;Nishkulanand Swami&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nityanand%20Swami%20%28Paramhansa%29\"&gt;Nityanand Swami&lt;/a&gt;.\nAhmedabad and Vadtal Gadi.\nPrior to his death, Swaminarayan decided to establish a line of &lt;a href=\"acharya\"&gt;acharya&lt;/a&gt;s or preceptors, as his successors. He established two \"gadis\" (seats of leadership). One seat was established at Ahmedabad (&lt;a href=\"Nar%20Narayan%20Dev%20Gadi\"&gt;Nar Narayan Dev Gadi&lt;/a&gt;) and the other one at Vadtal (&lt;a href=\"Laxmi%20Narayan%20Dev%20Gadi\"&gt;Laxmi Narayan Dev Gadi&lt;/a&gt;) on 21 November 1825. Swaminarayan appointed an acharya to each of these \"gadis\" to pass on his message to others and to preserve his fellowship, the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. These acharyas came from his immediate family after sending representatives to search them out in &lt;a href=\"Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;. He formally adopted a son from his brothers and appointed him to the office of acharya. &lt;a href=\"Ayodhyaprasad\"&gt;Ayodhyaprasad&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Swaminarayan's elder brother Rampratap and Raghuvira, the son of his younger brother Ichcharam, were appointed \"acharyas\" of the &lt;a href=\"Ahmedabad\"&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt; Gadi and the &lt;a href=\"Vadtal\"&gt;Vadtal&lt;/a&gt; Gadi respectively. Swaminarayan decreed that the office should be hereditary so that \"acharyas\" would maintain a direct line of blood descent from his family. The administrative division of his followers into two territorial dioceses is set forth in minute detail in a document written by Swaminarayan called &lt;a href=\"Desh%20Vibhaag%20Lekh\"&gt;Desh Vibhaag Lekh&lt;/a&gt;. Swaminarayan stated to all the devotees and saints to obey both the Acharyas and &lt;a href=\"Gopalanand%20Swami\"&gt;Gopalanand Swami&lt;/a&gt; who was considered as the main pillar and chief ascetic for the sampradaya.\nThe current acharya of the Ahmedabad Gadi is &lt;a href=\"Koshalendraprasad%20Pande\"&gt;Koshalendraprasad Pande&lt;/a&gt; and Ajendraprasad Pande, of the Vadtal Gadi.\nDeath.\nIn 1830, Swaminarayan gathered his followers and announced his departure. He later died on 1 June 1830 (Jeth sud 10, Samvat 1886), and it is believed by followers that, at the time of his death, Swaminarayan left Earth for &lt;a href=\"Akshardham%20%28philosophy%29\"&gt;Akshardham&lt;/a&gt;, his abode. He was cremated according to Hindu rites at Lakshmi Wadi in &lt;a href=\"Gadhada\"&gt;Gadhada&lt;/a&gt;.\nSocial views.\nWomen.\nSwaminarayan insisted that education was the inherent right of all people, including women, despite considerable criticism from those in his own contemporary society who \"loathed the uplift of lower &lt;a href=\"caste\"&gt;caste&lt;/a&gt; women\". At that time, influential and wealthy individuals educated their girls through private and personal tuition. Male followers of Swaminarayan made arrangements to educate their female family members. The literacy rate among females began to increase during Swaminarayan's time, and they were able to give discourses on spiritual subjects. Members of the sect consider Swaminarayan a pioneer of education of females in India.\nAccording to the author Raymond Brady Williams, \"Swaminarayan is an early representative of the practice of advocacy of women's rights without personal involvement with women\". To counter the practice of \"&lt;a href=\"Sati%20%28practice%29\"&gt;sati&lt;/a&gt;\" (self-immolation by a widow on her husband\u2019s funeral pyre), Swaminarayan argued that, as human life was given by God it could be taken only by God, and that \"sati\" had no Vedic sanction. He went to the extent to call \"sati\" nothing but suicide. Swaminarayan offered parents help with &lt;a href=\"dowry\"&gt;dowry&lt;/a&gt; expenses to discourage female infanticide, calling infanticide a sin. For calling a halt to these prevailing practices, Swaminarayan's \"contemporaries naturally saw in him a pioneer of a reformed and purified Hinduism, and Swaminarayan Hinduism an \u2018ingrazi dharma\u2019 or British religion.\"\nProfessor David Harman observed that Swaminarayan \"criticized the popular &lt;a href=\"Shaktism\"&gt;shakta&lt;/a&gt; cults and '&lt;a href=\"Gosains\"&gt;gosai&lt;/a&gt;' and '&lt;a href=\"nath\"&gt;nath&lt;/a&gt;' ascetics for the contemptuous and instrumental way in which they viewed and treated women. These cults were often responsible for gross sexual abuse of women.\" Hardiman added that Swaminarayan's view towards women was not in line with this type of misogyny and was rooted in his desire to prevent ill-treatment of women along with promoting celibacy for ascetics. Swaminarayan \"forbade all sadhus and sadhvis (that is, male and female ascetics) of his sect from having any contact whatsoever with members of the opposite sex.\" This strict precept was one he likely internalized \"after travelling as an ascetic throughout India [when] he was reported to vomit if approached by even the shadow of a woman\". To help his male ascetic followers maintain their vow of celibacy, Swaminarayan taught \u201cthe woman who attracts attention is made up of bones, blood vessels, spittle, blood, mucus and feces; she is simply a collection of these things, and there is nothing to be attractive.\nMembers of the faith are defensive of the fact that some practices seem to restrict women and make gender equality in leadership impossible. They are only permitted to enter special sections of the temple reserved for women or have to go to separate women's temples. As with practices of &lt;a href=\"Niddah%20%28Talmud%29\"&gt;niddah&lt;/a&gt; in Orthodox Judaism, concepts of pollution associated with the &lt;a href=\"menstrual%20cycle\"&gt;menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt; lead to the exclusion of women from the temples and daily worship during the affected time. Swaminarayan also directed male devotees not to listen to religious discourses given by women.\nIn the case of widows, Swaminarayan directed those who could not follow the path of chastity to remarry. For those who could, he lay down strict rules which included them being under the control of male members of the family. This may seem regressive, however, it gave them \"a respected and secure place in the social order\" of the time. Swaminarayan restricted widows \"to live always under the control of male members of their family and prohibited them from receiving instruction in any science from any man excepting their nearest relations.\"\nCaste system and the poor.\nAfter assuming the leadership of the sampradaya, Swaminarayan worked to assist the poor by distributing food and drinking water. He undertook several social service projects and opened almshouses for the poor. Swaminarayan organized food and water relief to people during times of drought. \nSome suggest that Swaminarayan worked towards ending the &lt;a href=\"caste%20system\"&gt;caste system&lt;/a&gt;, allowing everyone into the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. However partaking in the consumption food of lower castes and caste pollution was not supported by him. A political officer in Gujarat, \"Mr. Williamson\" reported to Bishop Herber that Swaminarayan had \"destroyed the yoke of caste.\" He instructed his paramhansas to collect alms from all sections of society and appointed people from the lower strata of society as his personal attendants. Members of the lower castes were attracted to the movement as it improved their social status. Swaminarayan would eat along with the lower Rajput and Khati castes but not any lower. He allowed dalits and lower caste people to visit places of worship . However, &lt;a href=\"Dalit\"&gt;Dalit&lt;/a&gt;s - those outside of the caste system - were formally excluded from Swaminarayan temples. Members of a lower caste are prohibited from wearing a full sect mark (tilak chandlo) on their forehead. Even now, however, for the vast majority of Gujarat's lower-caste, Untouchable and tribal population, the sect is out of bounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Heber\"&gt;Reginald Heber&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, noted that disciples of Swaminarayan cut across all castes, and even included Muslims. He writes \"they all pray to one God with no difference of castes. They live as if they were brothers.\" Furthermore, in a meeting with Swaminarayan, he noted that \"[Swaminarayan] did not regard the subject as of much importance, but that he wished not to give offense (to ancient Hindu system); that people might eat separately or together in this world, but that above \"oopur\" pointing to heaven, those distinctions would cease.\" Swaminarayan worked thus to dispel the myth that &lt;a href=\"moksha\"&gt;moksha&lt;/a&gt; (salvation) was not attainable by everyone. He taught that the soul is neither male nor female, nor yoked to any specific caste.\nAnimal sacrifices and yajnas.\nSwaminarayan was against animal sacrifices as carried out by Brahmin priests during Vedic rituals, such as &lt;a href=\"yajna\"&gt;yajna&lt;/a&gt;s (fire sacrifices), influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Kaula%20%28Hinduism%29\"&gt;Kaula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vamachara\"&gt;Vama Marg&lt;/a&gt; cults. The priests consumed \"sanctified\" &lt;a href=\"prasad\"&gt;prasad&lt;/a&gt; in the form of meat of these animals. To solve this problem, Swaminarayan conducted several large-scale yajnas involving priests from &lt;a href=\"Varanasi\"&gt;Varanasi&lt;/a&gt;. These did not have animal sacrifices and were conducted in strict accordance with Vedic scriptures. Swaminarayan was successful in reinstating &lt;a href=\"ahimsa\"&gt;ahimsa&lt;/a&gt; through several such large-scale yajnas. Swaminarayan stressed lacto &lt;a href=\"vegetarian\"&gt;vegetarian&lt;/a&gt;ism among his followers and forbade meat consumption, codifying the conduct in the &lt;a href=\"Shikshapatri\"&gt;Shikshapatri&lt;/a&gt;.\nScriptures.\nSwaminarayan propagated general Hindu texts. He held the &lt;a href=\"Bhagavata%20Purana\"&gt;Bhagavata Purana&lt;/a&gt; in high authority. However, there are many texts that were written by Swaminarayan or his followers that are regarded as &lt;a href=\"shastra\"&gt;shastra&lt;/a&gt;s or scriptures within the Swaminarayan sect. Notable scriptures throughout the sect include the \"&lt;a href=\"Shikshapatri\"&gt;Shikshapatri&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Vachanamrut\"&gt;Vachanamrut&lt;/a&gt;\". Other important works and scriptures include the \"&lt;a href=\"Satsangi%20Jeevan\"&gt;Satsangi Jeevan&lt;/a&gt;\", Swaminarayan's authorized biography, the \"Muktanand Kavya\", the \"Nishkulanand Kavya\" and the \"Bhakta Chintamani\".\nShikshapatri.\nSwaminarayan wrote the \"Shikshapatri\" on 11 February 1826. While the original &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; manuscript is not available, it was translated into &lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20%28language%29\"&gt;Gujarati&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Nityanand%20Swami%20%28Paramhansa%29\"&gt;Nityanand Swami&lt;/a&gt; under the direction of Swaminarayan and is revered in the sect. The Gazetteer of the &lt;a href=\"Bombay%20Presidency\"&gt;Bombay Presidency&lt;/a&gt; summarised it as a book of social laws that his followers should follow. A commentary on the practice and understanding of &lt;a href=\"dharma\"&gt;dharma&lt;/a&gt;, it is a small booklet containing 212 Sanskrit verses, outlining the basic tenets that Swaminarayan believed his followers should uphold in order to live a well-disciplined and moral life. The oldest copy of this text is preserved at the &lt;a href=\"Bodleian%20Library\"&gt;Bodleian Library&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20University\"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; and it is one of the very few presented by Sahajanand Swami himself. &lt;a href=\"Tejendraprasad%20Pande\"&gt;Acharya Tejendraprasad&lt;/a&gt; of Ahmedabad has indicated in a letter that he is not aware of any copy from the hand of Sahajanand older than this text.\nSwaminarayan in various places of Shikshapatri describes Shri Krishna as the greatest entity. In Shikshapatri shlok 1 and 108 are few places that mention that Swaminarayan prayed on Shri Krishna.\nShikshapatri shlok 1\n\u0935\u093e\u092e\u0947 \u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u093e \u0930\u093e\u0927\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0936\u094d\u091a \u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938\u093f \u0964\n\u0935\u0943\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093e\u0935\u0928\u0935\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0902 \u0924\u0902 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0902 \u0939\u0943\u0926\u093f \u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u092f\u0947 \u0965 1\u0965\nv\u0101m\u0113 yasya sthit\u0101 r\u0101dh\u0101 \u015br\u012b\u015bca yasy\u0101sti vak\u1e63asi \u01c0\nv\u1e5bnd\u0101vanavih\u0101ra\u1e41 ta\u1e41 \u015br\u012bk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi cintay\u0113 \u01c1 1 \u01c1\n\"Translation: With all My heart, I meditate on Shri Krishna, who resides in the divine abode Vrindavan; with Radha on his left and Shree residing within his heart.\"\nShikshapatri shlok 108 also mentions that Shri Krishna is the greatest entity.\n\u0938 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0903 \u092a\u0930\u0902\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u094d \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0903 \u0964\n\u0909\u092a\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0907\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0926\u0947\u0935\u094b \u0928\u0903 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923\u092e\u094d \u0965 108\u0965\nsa \u015br\u012bk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 parambrahma bhagav\u0101n puru\u1e63\u014dttama\u1e25 \u01c0\nup\u0101sya i\u1e63\u1e6dad\u0113v\u014d na\u1e25 sarv\u0101virbh\u0101vak\u0101ra\u1e47am \u01c1 108 \u01c1\n\"Translation:\" \"The Lord, Shri Krishna is the greatest entity. I admire Him the most. He is the cause of all incarnations and is thus truly worthy to be worshiped.\"\nVachanamrut.\nThe Vachanamrut (IAST: \"Vacan\u0101m\u1e5bta,\" lit. \"immortalising ambrosia in the form of words\") is a sacred Hindu text consisting of 273 religious discourses delivered by Swaminarayan from 1819 to 1829 CE and is considered the principal theological text within the &lt;a href=\"Swaminarayan%20Sampradaya\"&gt;Swaminarayan Sampradaya&lt;/a&gt;. Compiled by four of his senior disciples, Swaminarayan edited and approved the scripture. As followers believe Swaminarayan to be Parabrahman, or God, the Vachanamrut is considered a direct revelation from God and thus the most precise interpretation of the &lt;a href=\"Upanishads\"&gt;Upanishads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bhagavad%20Gita\"&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/a&gt;, and other important Hindu scriptures. In the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan outlines the &lt;a href=\"Akshar-Purushottam%20Darshan\"&gt;Akshar-Purushottam Darshan&lt;/a&gt; and the necessity of the Aksharbrahman guru to attain moksha, a spiritual state characterised by eternal bliss and devotion to God. This scripture is read by followers regularly and discourses are conducted daily in Swaminarayan temples around the world.\nSatsangi Jeevan.\nSatsangi Jeevan is the authorised biography of Swaminarayan. The book contains information on the life and teachings of Swaminarayan. It is written by Shatanand Swami and completed in Vikram Samvat 1885. Swaminarayan decided to make Gadhada his permanent residence on the insistence of Dada Khachar and his sisters. Swaminarayan instructed Shatanand Swami to write a book on his life and pastimes.\nTo enable Shatanand Swami to write from His childhood, Swaminarayan had blessed Shatanand Swami with Sanjay Drishti - special power to see the entire past right from His childhood.\nOnce written by Shatanand Swami, this book was verified and authenticated by Swaminarayan. He was much pleased to read the book. Swaminarayan then asked his disciples to do Katha of Satsangi Jeevan.\nLegacy.\nSchisms.\nDecades after his death, several divisions occurred with different understandings of succession. This included the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Bochasanwasi%20Shri%20Akshar%20Purushottam%20Swaminarayan%20Sanstha\"&gt;Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha&lt;/a&gt; (BAPS), the founder of which left the Vadtal Gadi in 1905, and \"Maninagar Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan\", the founder of which left the Ahmedabad Gadi in the 1940s. The followers of BAPS hold &lt;a href=\"Gunatitanand%20Swami\"&gt;Gunatitanand Swami&lt;/a&gt; as the spiritual successor to Swaminarayan, asserting that on several occasions Swaminarayan revealed to devotees that Gunatitanand Swami was &lt;a href=\"Akshar%20Purushottam%20Upasana\"&gt;Aksharbrahm&lt;/a&gt; manifest. Followers of BAPS believe that the acharyas were given administrative leadership of the sect while Gunatitanand Swami was given spiritual leadership by Swaminarayan. The current spiritual and administrative leader of BAPS is &lt;a href=\"Mahant%20Swami%20Maharaj\"&gt;Mahant Swami Maharaj&lt;/a&gt;. The followers of the Maninagar Swaminarayan Gadi Sansthan hold &lt;a href=\"Gopalanand%20Swami\"&gt;Gopalanand Swami&lt;/a&gt; as the successor to Swaminarayan. The current leader of this sect is Purushottampriyadasji Maharaj.\nGrowth.\nAccording to the biographer Raymond Williams, when Swaminarayan died, he had a following of 1.8 million people. In 2001, Swaminarayan centres existed on four continents, and the congregation was recorded to be five million, the majority in the homeland of Gujarat. The newspaper &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Express\"&gt;Indian Express&lt;/a&gt; estimated members of the Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism to number over 20 million (2 crore) worldwide in 2007.\nMahatma Gandhi on Swaminarayan.\nIn relation to Swaminarayan's work and views, Gandhi remarked that \"the work accomplished by Swaminarayan in Gujarat could not and would never have been achieved by the law.\" However, in the letter to his nephew, he expressed that Swaminarayan's values didn't align perfectly with his interpretation of &lt;a href=\"Vaishnavism\"&gt;Vaishnavism&lt;/a&gt; and the love taught by Swaminarayana was all about sentimentalism. Commenting on Gandhi's social work, N.A. Toothi \"most of his thought, activities and even methods of most of the institutions which he has been building up and serving, have the flavour of Swaminarayanism, more than that of any other sect of Hindu Dharma.\" "
