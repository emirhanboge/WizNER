In February 1487 she was engaged to be married to &lt;a href=\"Franceschetto%20Cybo\"&gt;Franceschetto Cybo&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Innocent%20VIII\"&gt;Pope Innocent VIII&lt;/a&gt;. They were married in January 1488, and she brought a dowry of 4000 &lt;a href=\"ducats\"&gt;ducats&lt;/a&gt;.

She used her influence with her father, her brother &lt;a href=\"Piero%20the%20Unfortunate\"&gt;Piero&lt;/a&gt;, and the Pope to help friends and poorer people get aid and positions within the church and governments.\nIn 1488 she bought a thermal bath resort in &lt;a href=\"Stigliano%20%28Sovicille%29\"&gt;Stigliano&lt;/a&gt;. She had the property renovated and turned it into a profitable resort.\nMaddalena lived in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; after the election of her brother Giovanni as &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Leo%20X\"&gt;Pope Leo X&lt;/a&gt; in 1513. Shortly after his election, Pope Leo made her son Innocenzo a Cardinal. Maddalena received Roman citizenship and a pension from her brother in 1515.
