    "text": "Joseph Henry Kirkwood Sr. (3 April 1897 \u2013 29 October 1970) was a &lt;a href=\"professional%20golfer\"&gt;professional golfer&lt;/a&gt; who is acknowledged as having put &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n golf on the world map.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Kirkwood left home at age ten to work on a sheep &lt;a href=\"Station%20%28Australian%20agriculture%29\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt; in the Australian &lt;a href=\"Outback\"&gt;Outback&lt;/a&gt;, where his boss introduced him to the game of golf. He developed his skills to the point where he could compete in his country's most important golf tournaments. Kirkwood won the 1920 &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;Australian Open&lt;/a&gt; with a score of 290, 12 strokes better than the previous tournament record score. Later in 1920 he won the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Open\"&gt;New Zealand Open&lt;/a&gt;.\nKirkwood's success led him to &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; where, in his first competition, he defeated the great &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Vardon\"&gt;Harry Vardon&lt;/a&gt;. He began playing on the professional tour in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in 1923, winning that year's &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Invitational\"&gt;Houston Invitational&lt;/a&gt;, and was the first Australian to win on what became the &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Tour\"&gt;PGA Tour&lt;/a&gt;. In 1924, he was one of the top-ranked golfers on the tour with five victories, three of which were consecutive. Kirkwood remains co-holder of the record for the widest winning stroke margin in &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Tour\"&gt;PGA Tour&lt;/a&gt; history, set at the 1924 Corpus Christi Open in &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. That year he also teamed up with &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Hagen\"&gt;Walter Hagen&lt;/a&gt; to begin travelling around the globe putting on golf and trick-shot exhibitions, &lt;a href=\"newsreel\"&gt;newsreel&lt;/a&gt;s of which were sent back home to be shown in cinemas around the U.S.\nKirkwood's best performance in a &lt;a href=\"Men%27s%20major%20golf%20championships\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; championship was a third-place finish in the &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Championship\"&gt;PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1930%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;1930&lt;/a&gt;, a semifinalist in the &lt;a href=\"match%20play\"&gt;match play&lt;/a&gt; competition. He finished fourth in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;British Open&lt;/a&gt; on three separate occasions. In 1933, he won the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;Canadian Open&lt;/a&gt;. He was apparently the first-ever golfer to tee off from the \"howdah\" atop a domesticated elephant, which he first did (and was photographed doing) at &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Calcutta%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Royal Calcutta Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Calcutta\"&gt;Calcutta&lt;/a&gt; in 1937, and soon after in other clubs in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, and later in &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver his lifetime in golf, Kirkwood is credited with scoring twenty-nine holes-in-one, two of which came in the same round. In his later years, he retired to the mountain resort community of &lt;a href=\"Stowe%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Stowe, Vermont&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;, where he was the local teaching pro at the Stowe Country Club. The club has held the Joe Kirkwood Memorial Golf Tournament annually since 1967. Notably, Kirkwood's skills remained at a high level for most of his life and at age fifty-one, in 1948 he and his son &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Kirkwood%20Jr.\"&gt;Joe Kirkwood Jr.&lt;/a&gt; both made the cut at the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt;, the first father and son to do so and a record tied only in 2004. When his son won the 1951 &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Ribbon%20Open\"&gt;Blue Ribbon Open&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee\"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;, Wisconsin, they became the third father-son winners in the history of the PGA Tour, which by 2010 still has only seven such pairs of winners.\n&lt;a href=\"Joe%20Kirkwood%20Jr.\"&gt;Joe Kirkwood Jr.&lt;/a&gt; became an actor who made a series of Hollywood films portraying the fictional boxer &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Palooka\"&gt;Joe Palooka&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of Joe Kirkwood Sr.'s most remarkable feats was playing a round of golf at 10-under-par 62, \"breaking his age\" when 63 years old.\nKirkwood died at age 73 in 1970 in &lt;a href=\"Burlington%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Burlington, Vermont&lt;/a&gt;. He was elected to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Golf%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;American Golf Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Foxburg%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Foxburg, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"autobiography\"&gt;autobiography&lt;/a&gt;, as told to Barbara Fey, was published posthumously in 1973 under the title \"Links of Life\". In his honour, the annual winner of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;Australian PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt; receives the \"Kirkwood Cup\". He is buried in the West Branch Cemetery in Stowe.\nProfessional wins.\nOther wins.\n\"this list may be incomplete\"\nResults in major championships.\nNYF = tournament not yet founded&lt;br&gt;\nNT = no tournament&lt;br&gt;\nWD = withdrew&lt;br&gt;\nCUT = missed the half-way cut&lt;br&gt;\nR32, R16, QF, SF = round in which player lost in PGA Championship match play&lt;br&gt;\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place"
