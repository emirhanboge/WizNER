    "text": "St Hilda's College is a &lt;a href=\"college\"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"The%20University%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;The University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, providing a residential community for students from all parts of regional &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, interstate and overseas. It provides accommodation, academic and &lt;a href=\"Pastoral%20care\"&gt;pastoral support&lt;/a&gt; for 210 undergraduate students and 10 graduate students. 15 residential tutors are also accommodated in the college.\nHistory.\nSt Hilda's College was established as a result of the inspiration of Dr E.H. Sugden, the first &lt;a href=\"Master%20%28college%29\"&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20College%20%28University%20of%20Melbourne%29\"&gt;Queen's College&lt;/a&gt;, who in 1888, at the Official Opening of Queen's, stated: \"I hope we soon have a hostel for women in these grounds\".\nBetween 1888 and 1957 there were a number of attempts to establish a &lt;a href=\"residential%20college\"&gt;residential college&lt;/a&gt; to provide for the needs of the increasing numbers of young &lt;a href=\"Methodist\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Presbyterian\"&gt;Presbyterian&lt;/a&gt; women who were coming to &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; to undertake tertiary study. However it was not until 1957 when a provisional council was established and then 1959 when a group of church and university women began a fundraising campaign that the idea started to become a reality. Early in this successful attempt, Queen's College donated the land on which St Hilda's now stands, an area to the west of the Queen's buildings then known affectionately as the \"cow paddock\". This donation facilitated the development of the much discussed college - land was available, only money was now required.\nMrs Marjorie Smart was invited to take up the position of &lt;a href=\"Principal%20%28academia%29\"&gt;Principal&lt;/a&gt;, and with her background in &lt;a href=\"Academy%20%28educational%20institution%29\"&gt;academia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"diplomatic%20service\"&gt;diplomatic service&lt;/a&gt; showed herself to be ideally suited to be the foundation principal of a fledgling college. Building commenced in September 1962, and by March 1964 the first students arrived to take up residence with over 250 students applying for the initial 87 places available.\nIn 2014, the college celebrated its 50th Anniversary with a series of decade reunions and celebratory events, including a production of Barry Manilow's 'Copacabana'.\nBuildings.\nAlthough initially established as a college for women, when all colleges were single-sex residences, St Hilda's was the first at The University of Melbourne to become co-educational, in 1973. A fitting tribute to its namesake, &lt;a href=\"St%20Hilda\"&gt;St Hilda&lt;/a&gt;, who is believed to have run the first co-educational &lt;a href=\"abbey\"&gt;abbey&lt;/a&gt; in the English town now known as &lt;a href=\"Whitby\"&gt;Whitby&lt;/a&gt;, in the years around 663AD.\nA &lt;a href=\"statute\"&gt;statute&lt;/a&gt; granting affiliation with The University of Melbourne was passed in 1960 and a public appeal was launched under the patronage of Dame &lt;a href=\"Pattie%20Menzies\"&gt;Pattie Menzies&lt;/a&gt; and the chairmanship of Sir Charles Lowe. The money raised in this appeal, together with grants from the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Victoria\"&gt;State&lt;/a&gt; Governments, made it possible to complete the first phase of the college building by the beginning of 1964.\nIn 2007, the Brian James Wing of the college was completed providing modern &lt;a href=\"Bathroom%23Ensuite\"&gt;en suite&lt;/a&gt; accommodation units for third year &lt;a href=\"Undergraduate%20education\"&gt;Undergraduate Students&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Postgraduate%20education\"&gt;Graduate Students&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Tutorial\"&gt;Tutor&lt;/a&gt; accommodation and a &lt;a href=\"Visiting%20scholar\"&gt;Visiting Scholars'&lt;/a&gt; Apartment.\nSport.\nSt Hilda's College participates in the Intercollegiate Sporting Council (ICSC) competition. Sports available to all residents include: &lt;a href=\"netball\"&gt;netball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australian%20rules%20football\"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt;, women's &lt;a href=\"softball\"&gt;softball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sport%20of%20athletics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, men's &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swimming%20%28sport%29\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rowing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;rowing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"field%20hockey\"&gt;hockey&lt;/a&gt;. Additional sports are also offered on an alternative year basis, these include: &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"volleyball\"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"badminton\"&gt;badminton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Squash%20%28sport%29\"&gt;squash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"table%20tennis\"&gt;table tennis&lt;/a&gt;.\nCultural.\nThe Intercollegiate Activities Committee (ICAC) run a number of events with which St Hilda's participate. These provide the opportunity for each of the colleges associated with The University of Melbourne to engage with members of other colleges from the university. Events include: Intercollegiate 'Fresher Dance Off' in which first year students present a dance learnt in their &lt;a href=\"Student%20orientation\"&gt;'O Week'&lt;/a&gt; to the other colleges with one college crowned the winner. &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bands\"&gt;Battle of the Bands&lt;/a&gt; involves each participating college forming a band and presenting a short set to the audience, with again one college being crowned the winner. Other ICAC events open to all colleges include &lt;a href=\"Pub%20quiz\"&gt;trivia nights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"public%20speaking\"&gt;public speaking&lt;/a&gt; events, &lt;a href=\"theatre%20games\"&gt;theatre games&lt;/a&gt; and more.\nLeadership.\nBrenda Holt has presided as principal of the college since 2017. James Hardiman is the current Dean of Students."
