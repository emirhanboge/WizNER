    "text": "Axien is a village and a former municipality in the &lt;a href=\"Wittenberg%20%28district%29\"&gt;Wittenberg&lt;/a&gt; district in &lt;a href=\"Saxony-Anhalt\"&gt;Saxony-Anhalt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1 January 2011, it is part of the town &lt;a href=\"Annaburg\"&gt;Annaburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography and transport.\nThe community lies about 35\u00a0km southeast of &lt;a href=\"Wittenberg\"&gt;Wittenberg&lt;/a&gt; and about 20\u00a0km north of &lt;a href=\"Torgau\"&gt;Torgau&lt;/a&gt; in the lowlands on the east bank of the &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt; on an old, now dry, arm of that river. West of the community runs Federal Highway (\"Bundesstra\u00dfe\") B\u00a0182, and to the north is the B\u00a0187. It lies on the \"Mid-Germany Church Road\". In the south, the community borders on &lt;a href=\"Saxony\"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe village of Axien is first documented in the 10th century. The village, however, must have been older, a castle by the name of \"Wazgrini\" in Axien having been mentioned in 865. It was used as a fortified &lt;a href=\"bridgehead\"&gt;bridgehead&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"ford%20%28crossing%29\"&gt;ford&lt;/a&gt; on the Elbe."
