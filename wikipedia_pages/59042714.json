    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"Greek%20mythology\"&gt;Greek mythology&lt;/a&gt;, Philyra or Phillyra (; ) was one of the 3,000 &lt;a href=\"Oceanid\"&gt;Oceanid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Naiad\"&gt;water-nymph&lt;/a&gt; daughters of the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oceanus\"&gt;Oceanus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tethys%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Tethys&lt;/a&gt;.\nMythology.\n&lt;a href=\"Chiron\"&gt;Chiron&lt;/a&gt; was her son by &lt;a href=\"Cronus\"&gt;Cronus&lt;/a&gt;. Cronus' wife &lt;a href=\"Rhea%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Rhea&lt;/a&gt; walked in on them, thereupon Cronus assumed the form of a stallion and galloped away, in order not to be caught by her, hence the half-human, half-equine shape of their offspring; this was said to have taken place on Mount &lt;a href=\"Pelion\"&gt;Pelion&lt;/a&gt;. When she gave birth to her son, she was so disgusted by how he looked that she abandoned him at birth, and implored the gods to transform her into anything other than &lt;a href=\"Anthropomorphism\"&gt;anthropomorphic&lt;/a&gt; as she could not bear the shame of having had such a monstrous child; the gods (specifically &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;) changed her into a &lt;a href=\"linden%20tree\"&gt;linden tree&lt;/a&gt;.\nYet in some versions Philyra and &lt;a href=\"Chariclo\"&gt;Chariclo&lt;/a&gt;, the wife of Chiron, nursed the young &lt;a href=\"Achilles\"&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt;; Chiron's dwelling on Pelion where his disciples were reared was known as \"Philyra's cave\". Chiron was often referred to by the &lt;a href=\"matronymic\"&gt;matronymic&lt;/a&gt; Philyrides or the like. Two other sons of Cronus and Philyra may have been &lt;a href=\"Dolops\"&gt;Dolops&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aphrus\"&gt;Aphrus&lt;/a&gt;, the ancestor and &lt;a href=\"eponym\"&gt;eponym&lt;/a&gt; of the Aphroi, i.e. the native &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;ns."
