    "text": "David Wayne Toms (born January 4, 1967) is an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20golfer\"&gt;professional golfer&lt;/a&gt;, who currently plays on the &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Champions%20Tour\"&gt;PGA Champions Tour&lt;/a&gt;. From 1992 to 2017, Toms was a member of the &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Tour\"&gt;PGA Tour&lt;/a&gt;, where he won 13 events, including one &lt;a href=\"Men%27s%20major%20golf%20championships\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"2001%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;2001 PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He was in the top 10 of the &lt;a href=\"Official%20World%20Golf%20Ranking\"&gt;Official World Golf Ranking&lt;/a&gt; for 175 weeks between 2001 and 2006, and ranked as high as fifth in 2002 and 2003.\nEarly life and amateur career.\nToms was born in &lt;a href=\"Monroe%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt; in northeastern &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. He is the son of Thomas Edward \"Buster\" Toms of &lt;a href=\"Minden%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Minden&lt;/a&gt; in northwestern Louisiana. Toms won the 15-17 Boys' event at the 1984 &lt;a href=\"Junior%20World%20Golf%20Championships\"&gt;Junior World Golf Championships&lt;/a&gt;. Toms also played little league baseball with future &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; players &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Belle\"&gt;Albert Belle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ben%20McDonald\"&gt;Ben McDonald&lt;/a&gt;. After graduating from Airline High School in &lt;a href=\"Bossier%20City%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Bossier City, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, he attended &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20State%20University\"&gt;Louisiana State University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baton%20Rouge\"&gt;Baton Rouge&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a member of the golf team.\nProfessional career.\n1989\u201398: Early years and first win.\nIn 1991, Toms finished T23 at the &lt;a href=\"PGA%20Tour\"&gt;PGA Tour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"qualifying%20school\"&gt;qualifying school&lt;/a&gt; to earn his first full tour card for the 1992 season. Toms made his first three cuts on tour including a third-place finish at the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Telecom%20Open\"&gt;Northern Telecom Open&lt;/a&gt;, although this was the only top 10 he would earn all season. The following season was also a struggle for Toms as he made just 12 of 32 cuts for the season, of which three were top-10 finishes. In 1994, Toms' lack of success continued on the PGA Tour and he lost his playing rights for the 1995 season.\nIn 1995, Toms played the entire season on the &lt;a href=\"Nike%20Tour\"&gt;Nike Tour&lt;/a&gt; (now the Korn Ferry Tour) with greater success, winning two tournaments, the Greater Greenville Classic and the Wichita Open. This success earned Toms his PGA Tour card for the 1996 season.\nUpon his return to the PGA Tour in 1996, Toms had a disappointing season with just two top 10s. However, he did manage to qualify for his first major championship of his career at the 1996 U.S. Open, where he missed the cut.\nIn 1997, Toms won his first PGA Tour event at the &lt;a href=\"Quad%20City%20Classic\"&gt;Quad City Classic&lt;/a&gt;, winning by three strokes over &lt;a href=\"Brandel%20Chamblee\"&gt;Brandel Chamblee&lt;/a&gt;. He followed this success in the 1998 season with a runner-up finish at the &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Chrysler%20Classic\"&gt;Tucson Chrysler Classic&lt;/a&gt;. At his first visit to &lt;a href=\"Augusta%20National\"&gt;Augusta National&lt;/a&gt;, he recorded his best finish in a major championship at the time with a T-6 at the &lt;a href=\"Masters%20Tournament\"&gt;Masters&lt;/a&gt;. In his defense of the Quad City Classic title, Toms finished fourth.\n1999\u20132000: Three more wins.\nIn 1999, Toms enjoyed seven top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour. In September, he won his second title at the &lt;a href=\"The%20International%20%28golf%29\"&gt;Sprint International&lt;/a&gt;, by three strokes over &lt;a href=\"David%20Duval\"&gt;David Duval&lt;/a&gt;. Toms almost added another title the following week when he narrowly missed out at the &lt;a href=\"Reno-Tahoe%20Open\"&gt;Reno-Tahoe Open&lt;/a&gt;, finishing in T-2 behind &lt;a href=\"Notah%20Begay%20III\"&gt;Notah Begay III&lt;/a&gt;. Toms did, however, win his third PGA Tour title a month later at the &lt;a href=\"Buick%20Challenge\"&gt;Buick Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, defeating &lt;a href=\"Stuart%20Appleby\"&gt;Stuart Appleby&lt;/a&gt; by three strokes.\nIn 2000, Toms made 26 of 31 cuts, including a tie for fourth at &lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;The Open Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He won the &lt;a href=\"Michelob%20Championship%20at%20Kingsmill\"&gt;Michelob Championship at Kingsmill&lt;/a&gt;, defeating Canadian &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Weir\"&gt;Mike Weir&lt;/a&gt; in a sudden-death playoff, giving Toms his fourth Tour victory.\n2001: PGA Championship.\nThe standout year of Toms' career came in 2001. He had nine top-10 finishes and three wins on tour, one of which was his first &lt;a href=\"Men%27s%20major%20golf%20championships\"&gt;major championship&lt;/a&gt;. Toms won the &lt;a href=\"Compaq%20Classic%20of%20New%20Orleans\"&gt;Compaq Classic of New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; by two strokes over &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Mickelson\"&gt;Phil Mickelson&lt;/a&gt; for his fifth PGA Tour title. That summer, Toms won a major, the PGA Championship, by one stroke over Mickelson. His winning score of 265 in the &lt;a href=\"2001%20PGA%20Championship\"&gt;2001 PGA Championship&lt;/a&gt; was the lowest absolute 72-hole score ever recorded in a major championship, until &lt;a href=\"Henrik%20Stenson\"&gt;Henrik Stenson&lt;/a&gt; shot 264 in the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;2016 Open Championship&lt;/a&gt;. Toms followed up his first major win by successfully defending his title at the Michelob Championship at Kingsmill. At the last event of the year, Toms entered a four-man playoff at &lt;a href=\"The%20Tour%20Championship\"&gt;The Tour Championship&lt;/a&gt; where he, &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Garc%C3%ADa\"&gt;Sergio Garc\u00eda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ernie%20Els\"&gt;Ernie Els&lt;/a&gt; lost on the first extra hole to &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Weir\"&gt;Mike Weir&lt;/a&gt;.\n2002\u201306: Five more wins.\nIn 2002, Toms lost in a playoff at the season opening &lt;a href=\"Mercedes%20Championship\"&gt;Mercedes Championship&lt;/a&gt; to Garc\u00eda when the Spaniard made birdie on the first extra hole. He did record a further 12 top-10 finishes with runner -up finishes at the &lt;a href=\"MasterCard%20Colonial\"&gt;MasterCard Colonial&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Buick%20Challenge\"&gt;Buick Challenge&lt;/a&gt; followed by a sole third-place finish at The Tour Championship.\nToms finished runner-up at the &lt;a href=\"WGC-Accenture%20Match%20Play%20Championship\"&gt;WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 to &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Woods\"&gt;Tiger Woods&lt;/a&gt;, losing 2&amp;1, and also finished tied for eighth at The Masters. At the &lt;a href=\"Wachovia%20Championship\"&gt;Wachovia Championship&lt;/a&gt;, he won his eighth PGA Tour title, by two strokes over &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Gamez\"&gt;Robert Gamez&lt;/a&gt;, and then recorded his best showing ever at the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt;, finishing T-5. A few weeks later, Toms won his ninth PGA Tour title at the &lt;a href=\"FedEx%20St.%20Jude%20Classic\"&gt;FedEx St. Jude Classic&lt;/a&gt; by three strokes over &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Price\"&gt;Nick Price&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2004, he defended his FedEx St. Jude Classic by finishing six strokes clear of American &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Estes\"&gt;Bob Estes&lt;/a&gt; for his 10th victory on the PGA Tour. Despite this win, Toms endured a steady yet unspectacular season earning over 2.3\u00a0million dollars.\nToms enjoyed a much better start to the 2005 season in which he had top-10 finishes in five of his first seven events, including a win at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship to record his first &lt;a href=\"World%20Golf%20Championship\"&gt;World Golf Championship&lt;/a&gt; victory. He defeated fellow American &lt;a href=\"Chris%20DiMarco\"&gt;Chris DiMarco&lt;/a&gt; 6&amp;5 in the 36-hole final on Sunday for his 11th PGA Tour win. Along the way, Toms defeated notables including &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Mickelson\"&gt;Phil Mickelson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Scott%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Adam Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Poulter\"&gt;Ian Poulter&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the season, he almost defended his FedEx St. Jude Classic title for a third successive year but finished one stroke behind &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Leonard\"&gt;Justin Leonard&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly in 2006, Toms won his 12th PGA Tour title at the &lt;a href=\"Sony%20Open%20in%20Hawaii\"&gt;Sony Open in Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, finishing five strokes ahead of &lt;a href=\"Chad%20Campbell\"&gt;Chad Campbell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rory%20Sabbatini\"&gt;Rory Sabbatini&lt;/a&gt;. He followed up this early season form with a T-2 finish at the &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Championship%20at%20Doral\"&gt;Ford Championship at Doral&lt;/a&gt; behind Tiger Woods and then a T-3 finish a week later at &lt;a href=\"The%20Honda%20Classic\"&gt;The Honda Classic&lt;/a&gt;. Toms' form dipped during the rest of season, only recording a further two top-10 finishes.\n2007\u201312: Injuries and comeback.\nIn 2007, Toms had solid season with a succession of top-10 finishes, most notably a ninth-place finish at The Masters and an equal-best T-5 at the U.S. Open. Toms made just over $2\u00a0million in prize money and finished 33rd in the &lt;a href=\"FedEx%20Cup\"&gt;FedEx Cup&lt;/a&gt; standings.\nToms struggled during the 2008 season with injuries that forced him to miss large parts of the season and underperform. He only participated in 20 events during the season with only one top 10. He finished the season 136th on the FedEx Cup standings, making just under $800,000.\nToms enjoyed a much better season in 2009, with three runner-up finishes at the &lt;a href=\"Sony%20Open%20in%20Hawaii\"&gt;Sony Open in Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Jude%20Classic\"&gt;St. Jude Classic&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Travelers%20Championship\"&gt;Travelers Championship&lt;/a&gt; amongst four other top-10 finishes. This form earned Toms a place in the season-ending &lt;a href=\"The%20Tour%20Championship\"&gt;The Tour Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He would finish 19th in the FedEx Cup standings with earnings over $3\u00a0million.\nIn 2010, Toms had just two top-10 finishes, his best placing coming at the &lt;a href=\"Wyndham%20Championship\"&gt;Wyndham Championship&lt;/a&gt; where he finished in second place, one stroke behind winner &lt;a href=\"Arjun%20Atwal\"&gt;Arjun Atwal&lt;/a&gt;. Toms made it to the third FedEx Cup playoff event the &lt;a href=\"BMW%20Championship%20%28PGA%20Tour%29\"&gt;BMW Championship&lt;/a&gt; but did not make it into the top 30 to advance and eventually finished the season 55th in the standings.\nToms started the 2011 season well with a T-5 at the &lt;a href=\"Mayakoba%20Golf%20Classic%20at%20Riviera%20Maya-Cancun\"&gt;Mayakoba Golf Classic at Riviera Maya-Cancun&lt;/a&gt; and a T-3 at the &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Palmer%20Invitational\"&gt;Arnold Palmer Invitational&lt;/a&gt;. Toms then came close to his first PGA Tour win in five years at &lt;a href=\"2011%20Players%20Championship\"&gt;The Players Championship&lt;/a&gt; where he eventually lost on the first extra hole to South Korean &lt;a href=\"K.%20J.%20Choi\"&gt;K. J. Choi&lt;/a&gt;. This came despite leading the tournament for the majority of rounds two, three and four. Toms held the lead for the entire final round until he reached the par five 16th hole where he found the water with his second shot. This enabled Choi to take a one shot lead down the 18th hole; however Toms would make a birdie to Choi's par to take the event into a sudden-death playoff. At the first extra hole, the 17th, both players found the green with their tee shots. They would both go on to run their birdie attempts past the hole, but Toms would also see his par putt lip out from four feet, allowing Choi to make a three-foot putt for the victory.\nToms bounced back the week after his playoff loss to win the &lt;a href=\"Crowne%20Plaza%20Invitational%20at%20Colonial\"&gt;Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial&lt;/a&gt; by one shot over &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Wi\"&gt;Charlie Wi&lt;/a&gt;. Toms tied the PGA Tour scoring record for 36 holes after shooting a pair of 8-under-par 62s for a seven shot lead at the halfway stage. Toms' lead disappeared after a third round 74 when he trailed Wi by one stroke entering the final round. However, in the final round he shot a 67, which included a holed-out eagle from the fairway on the 11th hole for a one stroke victory. This was Toms' first win in over five years on the PGA Tour. The win guaranteed Toms a place in the U.S. Open and moved him up to 28th in the Official World Golf Ranking.\nIn June 2012, Toms recorded his best-ever performance in a U.S. Open when he finished T-4. Toms had been one of the co-leaders after 36 holes at one under par alongside fellow Americans Tiger Woods and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Furyk\"&gt;Jim Furyk&lt;/a&gt;, but his challenge fell apart on day three when he found himself five over for his first six holes on his way to a 76. Toms did perform well on Sunday with a two-under round of 68, but fell short by two strokes.\nOther ventures.\nGolf course design.\nToms owns a &lt;a href=\"golf%20course%20design\"&gt;golf course design&lt;/a&gt; business, which he describes as what he plans to do after his playing days are over. His early works, all in Louisiana, were as a player-consultant, and in renovation and redesign of existing courses. The first course for which he was the lead designer was Carter Plantation in &lt;a href=\"Springfield%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Springfield, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhilanthropy.\nIn 2003, Toms created the David Toms Foundation for the purpose of helping underprivileged, abused and abandoned children. Grants are made to programs that are designed to bolster a child's self-esteem, and help him or her develop into a productive citizen. His foundation raised more than $1.5\u00a0million for &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Katrina\"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; relief. For his efforts, Toms shared the 2006 Golf Writers Association of America's \"Charlie Bennett Award\" with fellow Louisianans &lt;a href=\"Kelly%20Gibson\"&gt;Kelly Gibson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hal%20Sutton\"&gt;Hal Sutton&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nToms currently resides in &lt;a href=\"Shreveport%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Shreveport&lt;/a&gt; in northwestern Louisiana. He and wife, Sonya, have two children, Carter and Anna. In 2015, his son Carter signed to play for Louisiana State University.\nProfessional wins (19).\nPGA Tour wins (13).\nPGA Tour playoff record (1\u20133)\nNike Tour wins (2).\nNike Tour playoff record (2\u20131)\nOther wins (2).\nOther playoff record (1\u20131)\nPGA Tour Champions wins (2).\nPGA Tour Champions playoff record (1\u20130)\nMajor championships.\nResults timeline.\nCUT = missed the half-way cut&lt;br&gt;\nWD = withdrew&lt;br&gt;\nDQ = disqualified&lt;br&gt;\n\"T\" = tied for place\nResults in The Players Championship.\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\nWorld Golf Championships.\nResults timeline.\n1Cancelled due to &lt;a href=\"September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks\"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nQF, R16, R32, R64 = Round in which player lost in match play&lt;br&gt;\n\"T\" = Tied&lt;br&gt;\nNT = No tournament&lt;br&gt;\nWD = Withdrew&lt;br&gt;\nNote that the HSBC Champions did not become a WGC event until 2009.\nSenior major championships.\nResults timeline.\nCUT = missed the halfway cut&lt;br&gt;\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place&lt;br&gt;\nNT = No tournament due to &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;"
