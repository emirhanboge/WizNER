His form was mixed throughout the campaign and was signalled out for poor performances especially in the 10-46 defeat by local rivals &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20R.F.C.\"&gt;St. Helens&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout his Wigan career he was criticised for not producing the form that gave him his name at the Leeds Rhinos, many fans thought that he had pace but was not giving everything into every match which began to have negative effect on his future at the club.\nHe withdrew from the &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Scotland training squad&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2008 Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt; after being called up by &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. In September 2008 he was named in the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup%20squads%23England\"&gt;England training squad&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2008 Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and during October 2008 he was named in the final 24-man &lt;a href=\"2008%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup%20squads%23England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; squad. He was named in the &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; team to face &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Keepmoat%20Stadium\"&gt;Keepmoat Stadium&lt;/a&gt; prior to England's departure for the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2008 Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. but he like many other England stars produced many disappointing performances.\nHull F.C..\nCalderwood signed for &lt;a href=\"Hull%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull F.C.&lt;/a&gt; for the 2009's &lt;a href=\"Super%20League%20XIV\"&gt;Super League XIV&lt;/a&gt;\nFollowing his departure from Hull FC, he was linked with the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Wakefield%20Trinity\"&gt;Wakefield Trinity Wildcats&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;Crusaders RL&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Salford%20Red%20Devils\"&gt;Salford City Reds&lt;/a&gt;, however, no deal was reached. With &lt;a href=\"John%20Kear\"&gt;John Kear&lt;/a&gt; the coach at Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, they were the favourites to secure his signature for 2011. However, he accepted a contract at following a month-long trial.\nDuring May 2012, he signed for &lt;a href=\"RFL%20League%201\"&gt;Co-operative Championship 1&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Workington%20Town\"&gt;Workington Town&lt;/a&gt;."
