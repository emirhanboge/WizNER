    "text": "The Siege of Samarkand was the third and last campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Samarkand\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; by both belligerents. Four years after its recapture by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Babur\"&gt;Babur&lt;/a&gt;, there was a rebellion that lost the King of Ferghana his kingdom and his capital. In 1501, Babur and his army felt ready to besiege the city again. However, his invasion attempt was beaten off by Shaybani, an Uzbek tribal chief whose conquests were known across Central Asia."
