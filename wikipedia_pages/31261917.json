    "text": "Dudleston Heath (also referred to as Criftins) is a village in north-west &lt;a href=\"Shropshire\"&gt;Shropshire&lt;/a&gt;, England. It is located on the B5068 road between &lt;a href=\"Ellesmere%2C%20Shropshire\"&gt;Ellesmere&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St%20Martin%27s%2C%20Shropshire\"&gt;St Martin's&lt;/a&gt; and is part of &lt;a href=\"Ellesmere%20Rural\"&gt;Ellesmere Rural&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Civil%20parishes%20in%20England\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Wales-England%20border\"&gt;Wales-England border&lt;/a&gt; is just to the north.\nActivities.\nThe village has a village hall which hosts regular events such as coffee mornings, open days and other fund raising activities. These are arranged by the Events Committee. There are also regular user groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Institutes\"&gt;Women's Institute&lt;/a&gt;, senior citizens and bingo as well as card playing groups. There is also a franchised pub called the 'Parish Pump'. The hall possesses facilities for &lt;a href=\"snooker\"&gt;snooker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"crown%20green%20bowls\"&gt;crown green bowls&lt;/a&gt;, as well as having a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; pitch and beautiful allotments which are an asset to the community. The Parish Pump pub and hall have in the past played host to a small country music festival and a village fete.\nThe village has a football team of the same name which plays in Shrewsbury Sunday League.\nIndustry.\nThe village consists of a local &lt;a href=\"post%20office\"&gt;post office&lt;/a&gt; (now situated inside the Parish Hall), and a &lt;a href=\"working%20men%27s%20club\"&gt;working men's club&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the Parish Hall.\nThe main source of income in the area is farming which provides jobs for many people of the local area. The reason for the high amount of farming is that the majority of land in the area is taken up by fields and the high clay content in the ground provides minerals for the growth of crops. Others from the community commute to nearby towns such as &lt;a href=\"Ellesmere%2C%20Shropshire\"&gt;Ellesmere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oswestry\"&gt;Oswestry&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt; as the village is served by the 53 bus route stopping outside the Parish Hall.\nChurch.\nThe village's &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; parish church of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.achurchnearyou.com/church/4252/\"&gt;St Matthew&lt;/a&gt; is beside the road from Ellesmere to St Martin's. The churchyard contains the village's war memorial, a red stone cross unveiled in 1921, remains of a Saxon preaching cross, and a &lt;a href=\"yew\"&gt;yew&lt;/a&gt; tree with a girth of 20 ft and thought (in 2013) to be over 1,000 years old. Indoors is a Roll of Honour and framed list of local men who were on active service in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\nThe village also has a primary school, which has been expanded over the years. Many of its pupils then go on to &lt;a href=\"Lakelands%20Academy\"&gt;Lakelands Academy&lt;/a&gt; in Ellesmere travelling on the 53 bus."
