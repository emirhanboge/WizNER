    "text": "Vojihna or Vojin of Drama ( ; ca 1298\u20131360), was a &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20nobility\"&gt;Serbian nobleman&lt;/a&gt; that rose through the ranks and became one of the most acclaimed military commanders (\"&lt;a href=\"voivode\"&gt;voivode&lt;/a&gt;\") and dukes of &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Uro%C5%A1%20IV%20Du%C5%A1an%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Serbia%20%28medieval%29\"&gt;Serbian Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; (1331\u201371), he was titled \"&lt;a href=\"Caesar%20%28title%29\"&gt;Caesar&lt;/a&gt;\" (, sr. \u045b\u0435\u0441\u0430\u0440/\u043a\u0435\u0441\u0430\u0440), hence, he is mostly known as Caesar Vojihna (\u043a\u0435\u0441\u0430\u0440 \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0438\u0445\u043d\u0430). He held the region of &lt;a href=\"Drama%2C%20Greece\"&gt;Drama&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin.\nHe was probably born around 1298.\nIn a &lt;a href=\"Chilandar\"&gt;Chilandar&lt;/a&gt; charter of Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an, Vojihna is mentioned as \"nobleman and associate of my Empire, cousin Vojihna\". This has been interpreted in several ways; Cirkovic understand this as the two are relatives, but the degree of kinship can not be determined. According to Vojicic, he is the son of &lt;a href=\"Uro%C5%A1ica\"&gt;Uro\u0161ica&lt;/a&gt;, however this would mean that they are second cousins, thus Purkovic connects the kinship through &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Konstantin\"&gt;Stefan Konstantin&lt;/a&gt;, making the two cousins.\nIt is thought that he is the same as the \"\u017dupan Vojihna\", who is mentioned in 1323, as an ally of &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Vladislav%20II\"&gt;Stephen Vladislav II&lt;/a&gt;, during the war of the throne against &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Uro%C5%A1%20III%20De%C4%8Danski%20of%20Serbia\"&gt;Stephen Uro\u0161 III&lt;/a&gt; following the death of &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Milutin\"&gt;Stephen Milutin&lt;/a&gt;. With emphasis on Vladislav II being the son of Dragutin, and Du\u0161an calling Vojihna his cousin, this might be an evidence on Vojihna being the son of Uro\u0161ica, the brother of Vladislav II.\nLife.\nIn 1341, &lt;a href=\"Andronikos%20III%20Palaiologos\"&gt;Andronikos III Palaiologos&lt;/a&gt; died, which sparked a &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20civil%20war%20of%201341-1347\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In 1342 Du\u0161an became an ally of &lt;a href=\"John%20VI%20Kantakouzenos\"&gt;John VI Kantakouzenos&lt;/a&gt;, but only a year after, switched to the side of &lt;a href=\"John%20V%20Palaiologos\"&gt;John V Palaiologos&lt;/a&gt;. Kantakouzenos found new allies in the &lt;a href=\"Emirate%20of%20Aydin\"&gt;Emirate of Aydin&lt;/a&gt;. In 1344, Du\u0161an sent a small army led by \"Voivode\" &lt;a href=\"Preljub\"&gt;Preljub&lt;/a&gt; to intercept the Aydin Turks. The Serbs were &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stephaniana\"&gt;defeated in battle at Stephaniana&lt;/a&gt;, however it did not halt the Serbian conquest.\n&lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Uro%C5%A1%20IV%20Du%C5%A1an\"&gt;Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an&lt;/a&gt;, called \"Du\u0161an the Mighty\" was proclaimed Emperor at &lt;a href=\"Serres\"&gt;Serres&lt;/a&gt; in 1345. In this southeasternmost part of his Empire, Du\u0161an appointed Voihna as governor of Drama, not far from Serres, before November 1345. When Du\u0161an was crowned \"&lt;a href=\"Emperor%20of%20the%20Serbs%20and%20Greeks\"&gt;Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks&lt;/a&gt;\" at &lt;a href=\"Skopje\"&gt;Skopje&lt;/a&gt; on 16 April 1346, he also crowned his son &lt;a href=\"Uro%C5%A1%20V\"&gt;Uro\u0161 V&lt;/a&gt; as King. Among his royal members and nobility he appointed &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20Uro%C5%A1\"&gt;Simeon Uro\u0161&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jovan%20Asen\"&gt;Jovan Asen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jovan%20Oliver\"&gt;Jovan Oliver&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Despot%20%28court%20title%29\"&gt;Despot&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Dejan%20Draga%C5%A1\"&gt;Dejan Draga\u0161&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Branko%20Mladenovi%C4%87\"&gt;Branko Mladenovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Sebastokrator\"&gt;Sebastokrator&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Grgur%20Golubi%C4%87\"&gt;Grgur Golubi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Preljub\"&gt;Preljub&lt;/a&gt; and Voihna (before 1348) as &lt;a href=\"Caesar%20%28title%29\"&gt;Caesar&lt;/a&gt;s. He was second in rank to \"Caesar\" Grgur.\nIn the end of 1347 or early 1348, he followed Du\u0161an to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Athos\"&gt;Mount Athos&lt;/a&gt;. He donated the village of Potolino in the lower Struma province to the Chilandar in 1348.\nImmediately after Du\u0161an's death (20 December 1355), his wife &lt;a href=\"Helena%20of%20Bulgaria\"&gt;Empress Helena&lt;/a&gt; was found in Serres. She started to exert her imperial control on the region. This surely was against the goals of Vojihna, which would later on trigger armed conflicts. How the Empress ended up in Serres and started to rule it is unknown, it exists sources saying she was in the region staying away from the harsh winter in the north, just when her husband died. As she was energetic and smart (although not so talented), she might have foreseen the crumbling of the Empire, and sought to rule this region. If this version is correct, Vojihna and his son-in-law &lt;a href=\"Uglje%C5%A1a%20Mrnjav%C4%8Devi%C4%87\"&gt;Uglje\u0161a Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; (the son of &lt;a href=\"Vuka%C5%A1in%20Mrnjav%C4%8Devi%C4%87\"&gt;Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;) were obliged to work for her as they had done to Du\u0161an, although as the future will tell; with less enthusiasm and fidelity. It is not known how much power Vojihna had in the Serres province, although he most likely had the ambitions of putting it under his control.\n&lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Kantakouzenos\"&gt;Matthew Kantakouzenos&lt;/a&gt; led &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20civil%20war%20of%201352-1357\"&gt;another civil war&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"John%20V%20Palaiologos\"&gt;John V Palaiologos&lt;/a&gt;, and when Vojihna heard that Matthew was coming with his Turkish troops (the &lt;a href=\"Emirate%20of%20Aydin\"&gt;Emirate of Aydin&lt;/a&gt;) he immediately consulted the court. As allies of John V (a relative Uro\u0161), Uro\u0161 assembled an army for his mother that was led by Vojihna. Among the forces were also Serbs from the vicinity of Serres.\nIn fall of 1356 he captured &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Kantakouzenos\"&gt;Matthew Kantakouzenos&lt;/a&gt;, the rival Byzantine Emperor and son of the former Emperor &lt;a href=\"John%20VI%20Kantakouzenos\"&gt;John VI Kantakouzenos&lt;/a&gt; (1347\u201354). Vojihna planned to release Matthew for a ransom, but soon realized that Emperor &lt;a href=\"John%20V%20Palaiologos\"&gt;John V Palaiologos&lt;/a&gt; was willing to offer a far greater sum. Matthew renounced his territory and imperial title in December 1357 and John V continued to rule as sole Emperor.\nIn 1358, his wife is recorded as making a donation to the &lt;a href=\"Koutloumousiou%20monastery\"&gt;Koutloumousiou monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1359, Helena abdicated and took monastic vows, under the name Elisabeth.\nHe died in ca 1360, and his lands were inherited by his son-in-law &lt;a href=\"Uglje%C5%A1a%20Mrnjav%C4%8Devi%C4%87\"&gt;Uglje\u0161a&lt;/a&gt;. He was buried in &lt;a href=\"Hilandar\"&gt;Hilandar&lt;/a&gt;, alongside his son who died prematurely."
