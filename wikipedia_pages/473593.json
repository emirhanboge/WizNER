    "text": "Cr\u00e9teil () is a &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20France\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; in the southeastern suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%8Ele-de-France\"&gt;\u00cele-de-France&lt;/a&gt;. It is located from the &lt;a href=\"Kilometre%20Zero\"&gt;centre of Paris&lt;/a&gt;. Cr\u00e9teil is the \"&lt;a href=\"pr%C3%A9fecture\"&gt;pr\u00e9fecture&lt;/a&gt;\" (capital) of the &lt;a href=\"Val-de-Marne\"&gt;Val-de-Marne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; as well as the seat of the &lt;a href=\"Arrondissement%20of%20Cr%C3%A9teil\"&gt;Arrondissement of Cr\u00e9teil&lt;/a&gt;. The city is, moreover, the seat of a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Cr%C3%A9teil\"&gt;Roman Catholic diocese&lt;/a&gt; and of one of France's 30 nationwide \"acad\u00e9mies\" (districts) of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Ministry%20of%20Education\"&gt;Ministry of National Education&lt;/a&gt;.\nName.\nThe name Cr\u00e9teil was recorded for the first time as Cristoilum in the &lt;a href=\"martyrology\"&gt;martyrology&lt;/a&gt; written by a &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Usuard\"&gt;Usuard&lt;/a&gt; in 865. The name \"Cristoilum\" is made of the &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20languages\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; word \"ialo\" (meaning \"clearing, glade\", \"place of\") suffixed to a pre-Latin radical \"crist-\" whose meaning is still unclear. Some believe \"crist\" is a Celtic word meaning \"ridge\", a cognate of &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; \"crista\" and modern French \"cr\u00eate\", in which case the meaning of \"Cristoilum\" would be \"clearing on the ridge\" or \"place on the ridge.\" A more traditional etymology was that \"crist\" referred to &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Christ\"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;, due to the very ancient presence of Christianity in Cr\u00e9teil and the veneration of &lt;a href=\"Agoard%20and%20Aglibert\"&gt;Saint Agoard and Agilbert of Cr\u00e9teil&lt;/a&gt;, martyred in Cr\u00e9teil around AD 400.\nGeography.\nCr\u00e9teil is a city in the south-eastern suburbs of Paris. It is watered by the &lt;a href=\"Marne%20%28river%29\"&gt;Marne&lt;/a&gt; river which carries out its last loop before the junction with the &lt;a href=\"Seine\"&gt;Seine&lt;/a&gt; at the Charenton-le-Pont. The area is an alluvial plain eroded by the action of the Marne and the Seine. Bordering communes include &lt;a href=\"Maisons-Alfort\"&gt;Maisons-Alfort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint-Maur-des-Foss%C3%A9s\"&gt;Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bonneuil-sur-Marne\"&gt;Bonneuil-sur-Marne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Limeil-Br%C3%A9vannes\"&gt;Limeil-Br\u00e9vannes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valenton\"&gt;Valenton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Choisy-le-Roi\"&gt;Choisy-le-Roi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alfortville\"&gt;Alfortville&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nThe climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. According to the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20Climate%20Classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification&lt;/a&gt; system, Cr\u00e9teil has a &lt;a href=\"marine%20west%20coast%20climate\"&gt;marine west coast climate&lt;/a&gt;, abbreviated \"Cfb\" on climate maps.\nHistory.\nSome rare flints from the &lt;a href=\"Palaeolithic\"&gt;Palaeolithic&lt;/a&gt; age are still being found in modern times in the area. It is, however, a two-&lt;a href=\"ton\"&gt;ton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt;-era polishing machine that is the prehistoric pride of Cr\u00e9teil. The first documents referring to Cr\u00e9teil are from the &lt;a href=\"Merovingian\"&gt;Merovingian&lt;/a&gt; era, when it was known as \"Vicus Cristoilum\"' The name comes from the prefix \"crist\" and \"oilum\". These two terms are thought to be &lt;a href=\"Gaulish%20language\"&gt;Gallic&lt;/a&gt;: \"clearing\" for \"oilum\" and \"ridge\" for \"crist\". The \"clearing\" of the \"ridge\" of the Mont-Mesly is on the road connecting Paris and Sens (Trunk Road 19 today). In 1406, the place name \"Cr\u00e9teil\" makes its appearance after successive deformations from \"Cristoill\" (1278), \"Cristeuil\", \"Cresteul\" then \"Creteuil\".\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"French%20Wars%20of%20Religion\"&gt;French Wars of Religion&lt;/a&gt; (1567), the &lt;a href=\"Huguenots\"&gt;Huguenots&lt;/a&gt; plundered the church and burned the local charters. New disorders in 1648 forced the evacuation of the inhabitants of Cr\u00e9teil. The end of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV\"&gt;Louis XIV&lt;/a&gt;'s reign was marked by a great food shortage throughout the whole of France after a terrible winter in 1709 that resulted in 69 recorded deaths in Cr\u00e9teil. Registers of grievances from the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in 1789 mention Cr\u00e9teil 15 times.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, construction of the first middle-class \"Parisian\" houses began. In 1814, the east of Cr\u00e9teil was taken by Russian troops. The bridge which spans the Marne between Creteil and Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s was inaugurated on 9 April 1841, replacing an ancient ferry.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Franco-Prussian%20War\"&gt;Franco-Prussian War&lt;/a&gt; of 1870 was particularly cruel for Cr\u00e9teil. The borough was plundered and left in ruins by the Prussians, while the nearby battle of Mont-Mesly on 30 November 1870, left 179 dead. Cr\u00e9teil gave up its pastoral character after World War II. The population subsequently rose from 13,800 in 1954 to 30,654 in 1962.\nL'&lt;a href=\"Abbaye%20de%20Cr%C3%A9teil\"&gt;Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil&lt;/a&gt; or Abbaye group was a utopian artistic and literary community founded during 1906 named after the Cr\u00e9teil Abbey near to where some members lived and where the group held meetings. At the time Cr\u00e9teil was still mostly pastoral, some of which remains in the forested parkland of the riverside district on and around Ile Sainte-Catherine. \nAlthough the group was short-lived, disbanding by 1908, it attracted artists, writers and philosophers to become associated with the &lt;a href=\"Symbolist\"&gt;Symbolist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Futurist\"&gt;Futurist&lt;/a&gt; movements such as &lt;a href=\"Filippo%20Tommaso%20Marinetti\"&gt;Filippo Tommaso Marinetti&lt;/a&gt;, author of the &lt;a href=\"Futurist%20Manifesto\"&gt;Futurist Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Br%C3%A2ncu%C8%99i\"&gt;Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 1965, the city became a Pr\u00e9fecture of the new department of the \"Val-de-Marne\".\nThe lake.\nCr\u00e9teil Lake began as a gypsum and gravel quarry. Once the &lt;a href=\"groundwater\"&gt;groundwater&lt;/a&gt; was reached, forming deep ponds, the quarry was abandoned and allowed to fill with water. The lake area is now a popular recreational site attracting fishermen, boaters, wind surfers, etc...\nHealth.\nAs of 1 January 2006, 27 &lt;a href=\"pharmacy\"&gt;pharmacies&lt;/a&gt;, about 60 dentists, about 60 general practitioners, 10 &lt;a href=\"pediatrician\"&gt;pediatrician&lt;/a&gt;s, and a half-dozen ophthalmologists and dermatologists constitute the general medical staff of the city.\nHealth facilities include:\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nPublic schools:\nPrivate schools:\nUniversities.\nThe city hosts &lt;a href=\"Paris%2012%20Val%20de%20Marne%20University\"&gt;Paris 12 Val de Marne University&lt;/a&gt;, officially the Paris-Est Cr\u00e9teil Val-de-Marne University, founded in 1970.
