The population was 411 at the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt;. The village is located on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Portage%20Lake%20%28Michigan%29\"&gt;Portage Lake&lt;/a&gt; and is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Onekama%20Township%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Onekama Township&lt;/a&gt;. The town's name is derived from \"Ona-ga-maa,\" an Anishinaabe word which means \"singing water.\" \nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the village has a total area of , all land. The M-22 highway runs through downtown Onekama.\nHistory.\nThe predecessor of the village of Onekama was the settlement of Portage at &lt;a href=\"Portage%20Point\"&gt;Portage Point&lt;/a&gt;, first established in 1845, at the western end of &lt;a href=\"Portage%20Lake%20%28Michigan%29\"&gt;Portage&lt;/a&gt;, at the outlet of Portage Creek. In 1871, when landowners around the land-locked lake became exasperated with the practices of the Portage Sawmill, they took the solution into their own hands and dug a channel through the narrow isthmus, opening a waterway that lowered the lake by 12 to 14 feet and brought it to the same level as &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Michigan\"&gt;Lake Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. When this action dried out Portage Creek on 14 May 1871, the settlement, which had only the week before been designated as \"Onekama\" with a Post Office under that name, moved to the previously submerged land at the northwestern shore of the lake near an earlier settlement called \"Brookfield\".\nIn 1880, the first public buildings were built in the new village. These included the Pierce Grist Mill and The Gibert Brothers' Saw Mill. In 1882, the first school was built next to the present-day Congregational Church. In 1883, a large summer hotel, The Glen House, was built near the Glen, with its three mineral springs that were believed to have medicinal value.\nThe village was incorporated in 1891 and included the earlier settlement known as Brookfield, creating a long narrow village about 1.5 miles long with the business section on the flat, former lake bottom and residences on the higher land.\nIn 1889, a branch of the &lt;a href=\"Manistee%20and%20North-Eastern%20Railroad\"&gt;Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad&lt;/a&gt; was extended to the village.\nDemographics.\n2010 census.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2010, there were 411 people, 205 households, and 114 families residing in the village.
