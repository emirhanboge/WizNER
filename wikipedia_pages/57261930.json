In 2015 Lithuanian municipal and 2016 Lithuanian parliamentary elections she participated together with a party \"&lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20List\"&gt;Lithuanian List&lt;/a&gt;\", though she didn't become its member, and is currently an independent politician.\nIn 2015 she was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Vilnius%20City%20Council\"&gt;Vilnius City Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nMember of the Lithuanian Parliament, 2016\u20132019.\nIn 2016 Maldeikien\u0117 was elected to the Seimas in a single-member district constituency of \u017dirm\u016bnai (Vilnius City).

Before considering it, Maldeikien\u0117 encouraged &lt;a href=\"Ingrida%20%C5%A0imonyt%C4%97\"&gt;Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117&lt;/a&gt;, another Parliament member, to run for the presidency instead. \u0160imonyt\u0117 made this decision in November 2018, upon being granted support from the party of &lt;a href=\"Homeland%20Union-Lithuanian%20Christian%20Democrats\"&gt;Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (though staying an independent).\nIn February 2019 Maldeikien\u0117 announced she was no longer running for presidency, as she attained her goal of inciting more debates (also expressing disappointment at them being not serious enough). On her personal website and social media account she started to publish weekly reviews, analyzing campaign actions of the remaining presidential candidates in the light of the developments of national and global politics. With the support by Au\u0161ra Maldeikien\u0117 continuing, Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117 received the highest number of votes of all candidates at the presidential election round in May 2019, but lost the second round and did not take the office.\nMember of the European Parliament, 2019\u2013present.\nLater in February 2019 Maldeikien\u0117 was registered as a candidate for &lt;a href=\"2019%20European%20Parliament%20election\"&gt;2019 European Parliament election&lt;/a&gt; by a civic electoral committee \"Au\u0161ros Maldeikien\u0117s traukinys\" (Lithuanian \"The train of Au\u0161ra Maldeikien\u0117\"). Such committees made up from a number of willing voters serve as an alternative to the parties in order to enable independent candidates to run for some offices. In April 2019 \"Au\u0161ros Maldeikien\u0117s traukinys\" became the first and only electoral list in Lithuania that gathered enough electronic signatures to participate in the European Parliament elections (without the need to rely partly on paper signatures, like all other electoral lists had to). Au\u0161ra Maldeikien\u0117's electoral committee won a seat at the &lt;a href=\"European%20Parliament\"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in May 2019, resulting in her becoming one among 11 of its members elected in Lithuania. Since her seat in the Seimas became vacant, Au\u0161ra Maldeikien\u0117 asserted that she will support the candidacy of independent Rasa \u017demait\u0117, who was also in the list of \"Au\u0161ros Maldeikien\u0117s traukinys\" in the upcoming September 2019 elections in constituency of \u017dirm\u016bnai.\nIn its electoral programme \"Au\u0161ros Maldeikien\u0117s traukinys\" has expressed intentions, if elected, to join one of the firmly &lt;a href=\"pro-European\"&gt;pro-European&lt;/a&gt; factions, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats%20for%20Europe%20group\"&gt;ALDE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"European%20Greens\"&gt;European Greens&lt;/a&gt; or a new group based on &lt;a href=\"Emmanuel%20Macron\"&gt;Emmanuel Macron's&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"La%20R%C3%A9publique%20En%20Marche%21\"&gt;La R\u00e9publique En Marche!&lt;/a&gt;\" if such was to form. In June 2019 Au\u0161ra Maldeikien\u0117 announced she's joining &lt;a href=\"European%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;European People's Party's (Christian Democrats)&lt;/a&gt; group, after evaluating the new transformations of ALDE (merging with other political forces to form Renew Europe) and the possible mismatch of her declared views to theirs, as well as, according to her, being rejected by the European Greens due to the objection of their member from Lithuania, Bronis Rop\u0117. When the evaluations of the campaign expenses started to appear in the media, it was ascertained that \"Au\u0161ros Maldeikien\u0117s traukinys\" spent only a bit more than EUR 5 thousand for European Parliament elections - much less than all the other electoral lists in Lithuania, which dedicated from EUR 7 thousand to 254 thousand (EUR 95 thousand on average). In a press conference, organized after the elections, Au\u0161ra Maldeikien\u0117 provided statistics, showing that differently than some other electoral lists, her committee didn't get to use funding for elections from the national budget, instead considerably relying on small (EUR 12 or less) donations from individuals, which it gathered much more than all the remaining electoral lists.\nIn July 2019 Maldeikien\u0117 started her work as a Member of the European Parliament within the European People's Party's group, however remaining an independent. She was selected to work in two &lt;a href=\"Committees%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament\"&gt;Committees of the European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"European%20Parliament%20Committee%20on%20Economic%20and%20Monetary%20Affairs\"&gt;Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20Parliament%20Committee%20on%20Budgets\"&gt;Committee on Budgets&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to her committee assignments, she is part of the European Parliament Intergroup on Disability.\nIn November 2019 a website \"Europos \u017einios\" (European News) was established, publishing articles of Au\u0161ra Maldeikien\u0117 and other authors. The description of it says \"it was created as a result of the promise of Au\u0161ra Maldeikien\u0117 to bring more of European policy questions into the national public space\".\nPersonal life.\nHer husband from 1979 till 2017 was &lt;a href=\"Eugenijus%20Maldeikis\"&gt;Eugenijus Maldeikis&lt;/a&gt;, a Lithuanian economist, politician (former minister of Economy, the Seimas member, European Parliament member and Vilnius City Councillor). They have two sons, (born 1980), the Seimas member since 2020, and Mykolas (born 1987).\nIn September 2019 it was made public that Au\u0161ra Maldeikien\u0117 has a II stage breast cancer, with her telling the media the unexpected diagnosis reached her in August 2019. In May 2020 in her social media account Au\u0161ra Maldeikien\u0117 announced that her treatment is finished, there are no signs of the cancer remaining and thanked her doctors.\nSince January 2017 Maldeikien\u0117 has been hosting a book club.\nBesides her native &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20language\"&gt;Lithuanian&lt;/a&gt; language, Maldeikien\u0117 speaks &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russian%20language\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; and has a fair command of &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;."
