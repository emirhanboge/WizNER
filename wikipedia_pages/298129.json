    "text": "Little Rock Central High School (LRCHS) is an accredited &lt;a href=\"comprehensive%20education\"&gt;comprehensive&lt;/a&gt; public high school in &lt;a href=\"Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Little Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkansas\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20education%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The school was the site of &lt;a href=\"Little%20Rock%20Nine\"&gt;forced desegregation&lt;/a&gt; in 1957 after the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruled that &lt;a href=\"Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education\"&gt;segregation of public schools was unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt; three years earlier. This was during the period of heightened activism in the &lt;a href=\"civil%20rights%20movement\"&gt;civil rights movement&lt;/a&gt;.\nCentral is located at the intersection of Park Street and &lt;a href=\"Daisy%20Bates%20%28activist%29\"&gt;Daisy L. Gatson Bates&lt;/a&gt; Drive (formerly 14th Street). Bates was an African-American journalist and state &lt;a href=\"NAACP\"&gt;NAACP&lt;/a&gt; president who played a key role in bringing about, through the 1957 crisis, the integration of the school.\nCentral can trace its origins to 1869 when the Sherman School operated in a wooden structure at 8th and Sherman streets; it graduated its first class on June 13, 1873. In 1885 the Sherman School was moved to 14th and Scott streets and was named Scott Street School, but was more commonly called \"City High School.\" Five years later in 1890, the Peabody School was constructed at West Capitol and Gaines streets. It was named in honor of philanthropist &lt;a href=\"George%20Peabody\"&gt;George Peabody&lt;/a&gt; from US$200,000 received via the &lt;a href=\"Peabody%20Education%20Fund\"&gt;Peabody Education Fund&lt;/a&gt;. In 1905, the city founded Little Rock High School at the intersection of 14th and Cumberland streets, and shuttered the Peabody and Scott Street schools to serve as the city's sole public high school. Until 1957, only white students were permitted to be enrolled.\nIn 1927 at a cost of US$1.5 million, the city completed construction on the nation's largest and most expensive high school facility, which remains in use today. In 1953 with the construction of &lt;a href=\"Hall%20High%20School%20%28Arkansas%29\"&gt;Hall High School&lt;/a&gt;, the school was renamed as Little Rock Central High School. It has since been listed on the U.S. &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; and named as a U.S. &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Site%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Historic Site&lt;/a&gt;.\nCentral High School, which covers grades 9 through 12, has an enrollment of 2,456 (2010\u201311). It is in the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Rock%20School%20District\"&gt;Little Rock School District&lt;/a&gt;, and serves sections of Little Rock and the entirety of &lt;a href=\"Cammack%20Village\"&gt;Cammack Village&lt;/a&gt;. The current principal is Nancy Rousseau, who became principal in 2002.\nHistory.\nEarly campus history.\nBuilt in 1927 at a cost of $1.5 million, Little Rock Senior High School was designed in the &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic Revival style&lt;/a&gt;; it was hailed as the most expensive, most beautiful, and largest high school in the nation. Statues of four figures over the front entrance represent ambition, personality, opportunity, and preparation. Its opening earned national publicity, with nearly 20,000 people attending the dedication ceremony. In 1953 it was renamed as Little Rock Central High School.\nAt the time in Arkansas and other states across the South, public school educational facilities were legally racially segregated. In 1954 the US Supreme Court ruled in \"&lt;a href=\"Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education\"&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/a&gt;\" that such segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, and encouraged the states to integrate their schools. Related historic events in the 1950s changed education at Central High School and throughout the United States.\nLittle Rock integration.\nLRCHS was the focal point of the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Rock%20Integration%20Crisis\"&gt;Little Rock Integration Crisis&lt;/a&gt; of 1957. Nine Black students, known as the &lt;a href=\"Little%20Rock%20Nine\"&gt;Little Rock Nine&lt;/a&gt;, were denied entrance to the school in defiance of the 1954 &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruling ordering &lt;a href=\"Racial%20integration\"&gt;integration&lt;/a&gt; of public schools. This provoked a showdown between the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Arkansas\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orval%20Faubus\"&gt;Orval Faubus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower\"&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt; that gained international attention.\nOn the morning of September 23, 1957, the nine Black high school students faced an angry &lt;a href=\"Crowd\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; of over 1,000 Whites in front of Central High School who were protesting the integration project. As the students were escorted inside by the Little Rock police, violence escalated, and they were removed from the school. The next day, Eisenhower ordered the 1,200-man 327th Airborne Battle Group of the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Army\"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"101st%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;101st Airborne Division&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Campbell\"&gt;Fort Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, Kentucky, to escort the nine students into the school. By the same order, he federalized the entire 10,000-man Arkansas National Guard, in order to remove them from the control of Governor Faubus. At nearby Camp Robinson, a hastily organized Task Force 153rd Infantry drew guardsmen from units all over the state. Most of the Arkansas Guard was quickly demobilized, but the ad hoc Task Force 153rd Infantry assumed control at Thanksgiving when the 327th withdrew, and patrolled inside and outside the school for the remainder of the school year. As &lt;a href=\"Melba%20Pattillo%20Beals\"&gt;Melba Pattillo Beals&lt;/a&gt;, one of the nine students, wrote in her diary, \"After three full days inside Central [High School], I know that integration is a much bigger word than I thought.\"\nThis event, watched by the nation and world, was the site of the first important test for the implementation of the U.S. Supreme Court's \"&lt;a href=\"Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education\"&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/a&gt;\" decision of 1954. Many areas of the South pledged to resist this ruling. Arkansas' governor Orval Faubus questioned the authority of the federal court system and the validity of desegregation. The crisis at Little Rock's Central High School was the first fundamental test of the national resolve to enforce black civil rights in the face of &lt;a href=\"massive%20resistance\"&gt;massive resistance&lt;/a&gt; during the years following the Brown decision. As to whether Eisenhower's specific actions to enforce integration violated the &lt;a href=\"Posse%20Comitatus%20Act\"&gt;Posse Comitatus Act&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court, in \"&lt;a href=\"Cooper%20v.%20Aaron\"&gt;Cooper v. Aaron&lt;/a&gt;\" (1958), indirectly affirmed the legality of his conduct. It was never expressly reviewed.\nIn 1958, federal Judge &lt;a href=\"J.%20Smith%20Henley\"&gt;Jesse Smith Henley&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Arkansas\"&gt;United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, stating that integration had \"broken down under the pressure of public opinion,\" suspended operation of the federal integration order until the 1960-61 school term. The school board said that it had faced large fees and could not afford to hire security guards to keep the peace in school.\nLRCHS was listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; on August 19, 1977, and was designated as a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt; on May 20, 1982. The school continues to be used as an educational facility.\nIn 2007, Central High School held an event for the 50th Anniversary of the Little Rock Nine entering Central. On September 24, 2007, a new museum was opened honoring the Little Rock Nine. That same year, &lt;a href=\"HBO\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; produced a documentary film directed by the &lt;a href=\"Renaud%20Brothers\"&gt;Renaud Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, \"Little Rock Central: 50 Years Later,\" which explored the significant changes and continuities within the school since its desegregation.\nTeaching evolution.\nLittle Rock Central High School made legal history again in 1968, in a case based on &lt;a href=\"Creation%20and%20evolution%20in%20public%20education\"&gt;the teaching of evolution in the public schools&lt;/a&gt;. LRCHS biology teacher Susan Epperson agreed to be the plaintiff in a case challenging an Arkansas law forbidding the teaching of the theory of &lt;a href=\"evolution\"&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"natural%20selection\"&gt;natural selection&lt;/a&gt; in the public schools. The United States Supreme Court's decision in \"&lt;a href=\"Epperson%20v.%20Arkansas\"&gt;Epperson v. Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;\" held that states could not require that \"teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma,\" i.e., the teaching of evolution in schools could not be forbidden on religious grounds.\nAfter integration.\nToday, the high school is minority-majority, with a minority enrollment of 67.7%. The racial breakdown of the school in 2021 was 52.7% Black, 32.3% White, 8.1% Asian, 5.5% Hispanic, and 0.9% two or more races.\nAcademics.\nThe assumed course of study follows the Smart Core curriculum developed by the &lt;a href=\"Arkansas%20Department%20of%20Education\"&gt;Arkansas Department of Education&lt;/a&gt; (ADE). For 2011\u201312, Central is in Whole School Improvement Year 4 in its work to reach &lt;a href=\"Adequate%20Yearly%20Progress\"&gt;Adequate Yearly Progress&lt;/a&gt; (AYP) toward the &lt;a href=\"No%20Child%20Left%20Behind%20Act\"&gt;No Child Left Behind Act&lt;/a&gt;.\nCentral has an International Studies &lt;a href=\"magnet%20school\"&gt;Magnet Program&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"EAST%20Initiative\"&gt;EAST Initiative&lt;/a&gt; Lab Program, more than 30 service, academic, and honors clubs, award-winning instrumental and concert band and choral programs, and more than 141 courses offered, including 35 &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Placement\"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pre-Advanced%20Placement%20Program\"&gt;Pre-AP&lt;/a&gt; courses and 5 foreign languages.\nPublications.\nIts student publications include \"The Tiger\" (the student newspaper), \"The Pix\" (the school yearbook), which was originally named \"The Cage,\" and \"The Labyrinth\" (the school poetry and arts magazine).\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//thepixyearbook.wordpress.com/\"&gt;\"The Pix\"&lt;/a&gt; was inducted into the Arkansas Scholastic Press Association's Arkansas Yearbook Hall of Fame on April 16, 2010.
