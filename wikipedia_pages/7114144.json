He advocates a multi-party democratic system for &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, and has been accused of plotting to overthrow the Vietnamese government. On 14 August 2006 he was arrested while on holiday in Phan Thiet and held in jail in &lt;a href=\"Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City\"&gt;Ho Chi Minh City&lt;/a&gt; without trial. On 14 August 2006 he began a &lt;a href=\"hunger%20strike\"&gt;hunger strike&lt;/a&gt;. His imprisonment was protested by a petition to the &lt;a href=\"US%20Congress\"&gt;US Congress&lt;/a&gt; calling for the blocking of economic trade agreement, &lt;a href=\"Permanent%20Normal%20Trade%20Relations\"&gt;Permanent Normal Trade Relations&lt;/a&gt;, PNTR, between the US and the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Viet%20Nam\"&gt;Socialist Republic of Viet Nam&lt;/a&gt;, SRVN. Under international pressure, the SRVN released Do from jail and &lt;a href=\"deportation\"&gt;deported&lt;/a&gt; him back to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on 21 September 2006.\nHe is a democracy activist for political change in Vietnam and his written various political topics calling for democratic elections in Vietnam and posting them on the internet in the United States.\nHe was forced to leave his country of South Vietnam due to political changes when the &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"National%20Front%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;North Vietnamese Army&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;Army of the Republic of Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; (ARVN), after the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Saigon\"&gt;Fall of Saigon&lt;/a&gt; and the nation was ruled under a communist dictatorship.\nExile in the United States.\nHe is an advocate of free elections in Vietnam under the pen name \"Nam Tran\" with which he posts his political papers on the internet and various Vietnamese language newspapers in the United States and overseas.\nOn August 14, 2006, Vietnamese police officers entered his family's home and called Do and his wife in for questioning for his alleged involvement in the &lt;a href=\"anti-communist\"&gt;anti-communist&lt;/a&gt; organization known as The &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Free%20Vietnam\"&gt;Government of Free Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; (GFVN). His wife was then allowed to leave. Do was then detained and not allowed to leave the country.\nThe GFVN has issued a statement of non-affiliation with Mr. Do, who in actuality is a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;People's Democratic Party of Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn protest of his detainment without due process by the Vietnamese government, Mr. Do began what was to be a 38-day &lt;a href=\"hunger%20strike\"&gt;hunger strike&lt;/a&gt;, drinking only water and, occasionally, milk. He was deported back to the United States on September 21, 2006.\nThe SRVN deems Do to be a national terrorist and threat to Vietnam."
