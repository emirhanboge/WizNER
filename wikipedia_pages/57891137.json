    "text": "\"Rather Have a Love\" is a song by American R&amp;B singer &lt;a href=\"Joe%20%28singer%29\"&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt;. It was written by Gerald Isaac, Derek \"D.O.A.\" Allen, and Alvin Garrett for his tenth studio album \"\" (2013), while production was overseen by Allen. Released as the album's lead single, it peaked at number five on the US \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Adult%20R%26amp%3BB%20Songs\"&gt;Adult R&amp;B Songs&lt;/a&gt; chart.\nCommenting on its release, Joe stated, that it \"certainly represents my style and flavor [...] It has that really romantic element to it. It also speaks a lot of guys in a relationship that have a good thing going on but sometimes you know how we are. We forget what we have and we treat things a little differently. This is just a reminder basically, \u201cI\u2019d rather have love than nothing at all\u201d. Who wants to be alone? It's a great song.\""
