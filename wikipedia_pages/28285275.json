    "text": "The Capture of the sloop \"William\" refers to a small &lt;a href=\"single%20ship%20action\"&gt;single ship action&lt;/a&gt; fought between &lt;a href=\"Calico%20Jack\"&gt;John \"Calico Jack\" Rackham&lt;/a&gt; and English privateer &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Barnet\"&gt;Jonathan Barnet&lt;/a&gt;. The battle was fought in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Negril\"&gt;Negril&lt;/a&gt;, Jamaica and ended with the capture of Rackham and his crew.\nBackground.\nRackham commanded \"William\", a small but fast twelve-ton &lt;a href=\"sloop\"&gt;sloop&lt;/a&gt; during the action. Her armament was light, consisting of at least four cannon and at the time of battle carried a crew of fourteen including Rackham and the pirates &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Read\"&gt;Mary Read&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Bonny\"&gt;Anne Bonny&lt;/a&gt;. Calico Jack was originally a &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Vane\"&gt;Charles Vane&lt;/a&gt; but soon after gained his own ship. In 1719, he sailed to New Providence to receive a &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Pardon%20%28piracy%29\"&gt;pardon&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"letter%20of%20marque\"&gt;letter of marque&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Governor\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"New%20Providence\"&gt;New Providence&lt;/a&gt; Captain &lt;a href=\"Woodes%20Rogers\"&gt;Woodes Rogers&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Quadruple%20Alliance\"&gt;War of the Quadruple Alliance&lt;/a&gt; had begun and &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; hoped to make &lt;a href=\"privateer\"&gt;privateer&lt;/a&gt;s of Caribbean brigands to fight the &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;. Captain Rackham was capable of receiving a pardon, but he did not receive a commission to attack the Spanish fleet.\nCalico settled in New Providence, where he met Anne Bonny, but when his money was gone he returned to his life of crime. On August 22, 1719, Rackham and 8 other men, stole and took to the seas aboard the sloop \"William\", in &lt;a href=\"Nassau%2C%20Bahamas\"&gt;Nassau harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Governor of Jamaica, &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Lawes\"&gt;Nicholas Lawes&lt;/a&gt;, directed Captain Jonathan Barnet to take two sloops on a mission to hunt him down. One, \"Snow-Tyger\", was heavily armed with several guns and carried about twenty &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt; sailors and some &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; troops; the other was \"Mary Anne\" (under former pirate &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Bonadvis\"&gt;Jean Bonadvis&lt;/a&gt;) which carried about twenty men. Bonadvis was the first to spot Rackham, who fired on him; Bonadvis then retreated to report Rackham's position to Barnet, but did not further participate in the battle. The encounter is remembered more for its participants than the actual combat.\nCapture.\nOn or about October 31, 1720, Rackham's sloop was laid at anchor near Negril and fired a gun which caught the attention of Jean Bonadvis' sloop. Bonadvis reported this to Barnet who sailed to investigate the sloop. At 10 PM Barnet called out to the sloop and inquired as to who they were. The reply was \"John Rackham from Cuba\" and Barnet immediately ordered him to strike his colors. Someone (Barnet testified that because of it being so dark he could not identify who) replied that they would not surrender and fired a swivel gun at Barnet's sloop. Barnet ordered a broadside which destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Boom%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;boom&lt;/a&gt; on Rackham's ship and his crew called for quarter. \nBarnet had the men put ashore at Davis's Cove near &lt;a href=\"Lucea%2C%20Jamaica\"&gt;Lucea&lt;/a&gt; where Major Richard James, a militia officer, placed them under arrest. \nAftermath.\nRackham and his crew were brought to &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Town\"&gt;Spanish Town&lt;/a&gt;, Jamaica, in November 1720, where they were tried and convicted of piracy and sentenced to be hanged. Rackham was &lt;a href=\"gibbet\"&gt;gibbet&lt;/a&gt;ed on &lt;a href=\"Port%20Royal%20Cays\"&gt;Rackham's Cay&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance of Port Royal. The remains of the other pirates were placed at various locations around the port. Mary Read and Anne Bonny avoided hanging by claiming that they were pregnant, Read died several months later before her scheduled execution, while Bonny was never heard from again. Some accounts say Bonny retired and settled in North America and others say she returned to piracy. "
