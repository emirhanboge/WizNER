    "text": "Columbia Gorge Regional Airport , also referred to as The Dalles Municipal Airport, is a public use &lt;a href=\"airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Klickitat%20County%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Klickitat County&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;. It is located near &lt;a href=\"Dallesport%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Dallesport, Washington&lt;/a&gt; and two\u00a0&lt;a href=\"nautical%20mile\"&gt;nautical mile&lt;/a&gt;s (4\u00a0&lt;a href=\"kilometre\"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;) northeast of the city of &lt;a href=\"The%20Dalles%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;The Dalles&lt;/a&gt; in the state of &lt;a href=\"Oregon\"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;. The airport is jointly owned by the city of The Dalles and Klickitat County. It is adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20River\"&gt;Columbia River&lt;/a&gt;, near the east end of the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20River%20Gorge\"&gt;Columbia River Gorge&lt;/a&gt; National Scenic Area. This airport is included in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Plan%20of%20Integrated%20Airport%20Systems\"&gt;National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems&lt;/a&gt; for 2011\u20132015, which &lt;a href=\"FAA%20airport%20categories\"&gt;categorized&lt;/a&gt; it as a \"&lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt;\" facility.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;, the city was granted $12,000 by the &lt;a href=\"Works%20Progress%20Administration\"&gt;Works Progress Administration&lt;/a&gt; (WPA), but that was later revoked in 1935 when the WPA learned the city only leased the airport.\nDuring reconstruction of the original runway 12/30, the runway was renumbered to the current 13/31 designation. The &lt;a href=\"North%20Magnetic%20Pole\"&gt;Earth's magnetic north pole&lt;/a&gt; moves continuously, and when the original runway was constructed the magnetic headings were approximately 120 and 300. &lt;a href=\"North%20Magnetic%20Pole\"&gt;Magnetic north&lt;/a&gt; drifted over the life of the runway, such that by the time it was due for reconstruction, the magnetic headings were closer to 130 and 310.\nFacilities and aircraft.\nThe airport covers an area of 997 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s (403 &lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;ha&lt;/a&gt;) at an &lt;a href=\"elevation\"&gt;elevation&lt;/a&gt; of 247 feet (75 m) above &lt;a href=\"mean%20sea%20level\"&gt;mean sea level&lt;/a&gt;. It has two &lt;a href=\"runway\"&gt;runway&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"asphalt\"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt; surfaces: 12/30 is 5,097 by 100 feet (1,554 x 30 m) and 7/25 is 4,647 by 100 feet (1,416 x 30 m).\nFor the 12-month period ending September 8, 2010, the airport had 16,282 aircraft operations, an average of 44 per day: 84% &lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt;, 11% &lt;a href=\"air%20taxi\"&gt;air taxi&lt;/a&gt;, and 5% &lt;a href=\"military%20aviation\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt;. At that time there were 58 aircraft based at this airport: 98% single-&lt;a href=\"aircraft%20engine\"&gt;engine&lt;/a&gt; and 2% &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;."
