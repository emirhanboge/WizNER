    "text": "The Tayana 37 is a Taiwanese &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt; that was designed by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Perry%20%28yacht%20designer%29\"&gt;Robert Perry&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Cruising%20%28maritime%29\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and first built in 1976.\nThe design was originally commissioned by Will Eckert, of &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Dutchman%20Yachts\"&gt;Flying Dutchman Yachts&lt;/a&gt; and C.T. Chen, of &lt;a href=\"Ta%20Yang%20Yacht%20Building\"&gt;Ta Yang Yacht Building&lt;/a&gt;. The latter bought the rights to the design and commenced production as the CT 37. It was initially called the Ta Chiao 37 and then the Ta Yang 37, before the name was changed to the Tayana 37.\nProduction.\nThe design is built by Ta Yang Yacht Building, under the &lt;a href=\"Tayana%20Yachts\"&gt;Tayana Yachts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"brand\"&gt;brand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. The company had built 588 boats by 2012 and the design remained available for orders in 2020.\nDesign.\nThe Tayana 37 is a recreational &lt;a href=\"keelboat\"&gt;keelboat&lt;/a&gt;, built predominantly of &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"teak\"&gt;teak&lt;/a&gt; wood trim, including teak decks. It is a &lt;a href=\"cutter%20rig\"&gt;cutter rig&lt;/a&gt;ged &lt;a href=\"sloop\"&gt;sloop&lt;/a&gt;, with a few built with the optional &lt;a href=\"ketch\"&gt;ketch&lt;/a&gt; rig. The boat has &lt;a href=\"spruce\"&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt; spars and a &lt;a href=\"bowsprit\"&gt;bowsprit&lt;/a&gt; that brings the length to . A &lt;a href=\"pilothouse\"&gt;pilothouse&lt;/a&gt; was also optional. The design has a spooned &lt;a href=\"raked%20stem\"&gt;raked stem&lt;/a&gt;, a canoe &lt;a href=\"Transom%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;transom&lt;/a&gt;, a keel-mounted &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20wheel\"&gt;wheel&lt;/a&gt; and a fixed modified long &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt;, with a cutaway forefoot. It displaces and carries of iron ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of with the standard keel.\nThe boat is fitted with a Japanese &lt;a href=\"Yanmar\"&gt;Yanmar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt; of for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of .\nThe design interior arrangement varies based on the rig and customer preferences. A typical configuration has sleeping accommodation for seven people, with a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin, a \"U\"-shaped settee with a drop-down dinette table and a straight settee in the main cabin, with a pilot berth above and an aft cabin with a double berth on the starboard side. The &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; is located on the port side just forward of the &lt;a href=\"companionway\"&gt;companionway&lt;/a&gt; ladder. The galley is \"U\"-shaped and is equipped with a three-burner &lt;a href=\"propane\"&gt;propane&lt;/a&gt;-fired stove, an oven and a double sink. A navigation station is opposite the galley, on the starboard side. The &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is located just aft of the bow cabin on the port side and includes a shower, with a teak floor grating, plus hot and cold pressurized water. The interior trim and doors are all made from teak.\nVentilation is provided by eleven &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt; ports, a teak forward hatch and a teak-framed skylight.\nFor sailing the design is equipped with two travelers, including a &lt;a href=\"staysail\"&gt;staysail&lt;/a&gt; traveler, as the staysail is &lt;a href=\"Boom%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;boom-mounted&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"mainsheet%20traveler\"&gt;mainsheet traveler&lt;/a&gt;. There are two &lt;a href=\"winches\"&gt;winches&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"jib\"&gt;jib&lt;/a&gt; sheets, one for the &lt;a href=\"jib\"&gt;jib&lt;/a&gt;, one for the &lt;a href=\"mainsheet\"&gt;mainsheet&lt;/a&gt; and three for the three sail &lt;a href=\"halyards\"&gt;halyards&lt;/a&gt;. There are jib tracks mounted on the toe rails, plus outboard &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;shrouds&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe design has a &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Handicap%20Racing%20Fleet\"&gt;PHRF&lt;/a&gt; racing average handicap of 126.\nOperational history.\nIn a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote that the \"Tayana [37] is in many respects \u2014 perhaps except for the double-ended design \u2014 typical of the many high-performance designs built today that retain a traditional appearance.\"\nIn a 2019 review, Charles Doane wrote, \"the Tayana 37 is the most successful of the many Taiwan-built double-ended full-keel cruisers that were conceived in the mid-1970s in the wake of the great success of the Westsail 32 ... This boat is quite heavy by today's standards, but it sails remarkably well and can serve effectively as both a coastal and bluewater cruiser. It has a particularly strong reputation as an offshore boat and is certainly one of the more popular bluewater cruisers ever built. Reportedly at any given time there are more Tayana 37s out there wandering the globe than any other single type of sailboat.\"\nWriting a review in 2012 Steve Knauth noted, \"the Tayana 37 is distinguished most by its double-ended hull. The deep, full-keel bottom is designed for bluewater cruising, and the vessel\u2019s 22,500-pound displacement includes 8,000 pounds of outside ballast. Construction is solid, hand-laid fiberglass. Designer Robert Perry drew up two twin-headstay rigs, and the boat was rigged either as a cutter or ketch. Both versions carry large sail plans \u2014 the cutter more than 800 square feet, the ketch more than 750. They\u2019re based on a high aspect mainsail for upwind work and twin headsails for versatility. The deck profile shows a traditional trunk cabin ahead of a roomy aft cockpit with pedestal steering and controls, surrounded by a high coaming. Bow and stern pulpits are joined by double lifelines with both port and starboard gates. There\u2019s also a pilothouse deck plan with a protected steering station.\"\nSee also.\nSimilar sailboats"
