    "text": "The Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah Stadium () is a multipurpose &lt;a href=\"stadium\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Terengganu\"&gt;Kuala Terengganu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terengganu\"&gt;Terengganu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. The stadium is named after the fourth Sultan of Terengganu. The stadium holds 15,000 people.\nIt is used mainly for &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches and serves as the home ground of &lt;a href=\"Terengganu%20FC%20II\"&gt;Terengganu FC II&lt;/a&gt;, a feeder team of &lt;a href=\"Terengganu%20FC\"&gt;Terengganu FC&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah Stadium was officially opened by the Yang Maha Mulia Pemangku Raja Terengganu, Tengku Mahmud Ibni Sultan Ismail Nasaruddin Shah on 27 August 1967.\nIn 2008 after the completion of the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Mizan%20Zainal%20Abidin%20Stadium\"&gt;Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, the stadium were going to be demolish by the Kuala Terengganu City Council () (MBKT) to make way for a new development project of a recreational hub and multi-storey car park dubbed as \u201cDataran Kuala Terengganu\u201d.\nHowever, on 2 June 2009, the stadium demolition process were halted after the roof of Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium collapse. By then the upper sections which expanded the original capacity of the stadium to 20,000 spectators had been taken down and the football pitch was in a bad state due to the heavy vehicles being driven on it. Due to the urgent state of affairs at that time, the stadium was quickly fixed and was restored to meet the minimum requirement of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Malaysia\"&gt;Football Association of Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; (FAM) and Terengganu F.C. were spared from playing the home matches somewhere else but with a reduced capacity of just 15,000.\nIn May 2015, the Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium was given the green light by FAM to hold competitive matches again after their competition committee members were satisfied with the repairs and upgrades carried out at the stadium. &lt;a href=\"Terengganu%20FC\"&gt;Terengganu FC&lt;/a&gt; returned to the Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium while &lt;a href=\"Terengganu%20FC%20II\"&gt;Terengganu FC II&lt;/a&gt; will continue to remain at the Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah Stadium.\nOverview.\nThe stadium was built in the city of &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Terengganu\"&gt;Kuala Terengganu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terengganu\"&gt;Terengganu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;."
