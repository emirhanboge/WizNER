It is a spiritually important place for its Aboriginal owners, the &lt;a href=\"Wangaaypuwan\"&gt;Ngiyampaa Wangaaypuwan&lt;/a&gt; people. Hundreds of ancient rock drawings of humans, animals and the natural environment can be found at this historically invaluable site.\nOn 17 July 2004, the site was handed back by the Australian government to the Ngiyampaa Wangaaypuwan people, but is leased back to the &lt;a href=\"NSW%20government\"&gt;NSW government&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany animal species live here. There are &lt;a href=\"emu\"&gt;emu&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"kangaroo\"&gt;kangaroo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Pogona\"&gt;bearded dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gecko\"&gt;gecko&lt;/a&gt;s, and there is also the endangered &lt;a href=\"jerboa\"&gt;jerboa&lt;/a&gt; or the so-called as mouse that hops."
