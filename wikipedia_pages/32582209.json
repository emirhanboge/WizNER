    "text": "Pyrus bourgaeana, the Iberian pear, is a close relative of \"&lt;a href=\"Pyrus%20communis\"&gt;Pyrus communis&lt;/a&gt;\" L. The last was domesticated about 2500 years ago. This &lt;a href=\"monoecious\"&gt;monoecious&lt;/a&gt; small tree (typically 3\u20136 m high) is widely distributed across the southern &lt;a href=\"Iberian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Iberian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href=\"Morocco\"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;, where it coexists with four \"Pyrus\" species: \"P. communis\" L., \"P. cordata\" Dew., \"P. spinosa\" Forssk, and \"P. nivalis\" Jacq. Characteristics to discriminate these species are the width of fruit &lt;a href=\"Peduncle%20%28botany%29\"&gt;peduncle&lt;/a&gt;, petal size, leaf width and &lt;a href=\"Petiole%20%28botany%29\"&gt;petiole&lt;/a&gt; length served to the taxa.\n\"Pyrus bourgaeana\" flowers are white, rarely tinted pink, 2\u20133\u00a0cm diameter, and have five petals. Fruits are non-&lt;a href=\"dehiscent\"&gt;dehiscent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"globose\"&gt;globose&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pome\"&gt;pome&lt;/a&gt;s weighing ~ 9.5 g, with green or brown skin inconspicuous to birds, copious &lt;a href=\"lenticel\"&gt;lenticel&lt;/a&gt;s permitting scent to emanate, and pulp high in fiber. Each fruit usually contains 2-4 full seeds.\nWithin the Iberian Peninsula, \"P. bourgaeana\" distribution is very fragmented with trees occurring at low densities in small patches of &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; scrubland that are isolated from each other by towns, cultivations, etc. Within these patches, mature trees often are aggregated in small clusters of 8-10 individuals Iberian pears are remarkably resistant to sicknesses or &lt;a href=\"blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt;; they are more often killed by storms or high winds than by sickness.\nPhenology and interactions with animals.\nThe Iberian pear flowers during February\u2013March. It is pollinated by wide variety of insects such as &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s, flies, and &lt;a href=\"beetle\"&gt;beetle&lt;/a&gt;s. Each individual produces between 200-450 fruits that ripen and drop to the ground unaided from September to December. Predispersal seed losses by &lt;a href=\"invertebrate\"&gt;invertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"microlepidoptera\"&gt;microlepidoptera&lt;/a&gt; larvae) are usually low. Its seeds most frequently are dispersed by mammals. Indeed, mammalian &lt;a href=\"carnivore\"&gt;carnivore&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"badger\"&gt;badger&lt;/a&gt;s \"Meles meles\", &lt;a href=\"red%20fox\"&gt;red fox&lt;/a&gt;es \"Vulpes vulpes\", etc.) often ingest whole fruits fallen to the ground and disperse ingested seeds away from conspecifics with the capacity of &lt;a href=\"germination\"&gt;germination&lt;/a&gt;. In some areas, however, these dispersers have declined to low densities by hunting and other human activities. &lt;a href=\"Rabbit\"&gt;Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s \"Oryctolagus cunniculus\" and some birds also feed on its fruit, eating part of the fruit pulp leaving the uneaten seeds under fruiting trees. Rodents often depredate the uncovered seeds in those fruits partially eaten by pulp feeders. &lt;a href=\"Ungulate\"&gt;Ungulate&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"red%20deer\"&gt;red deer&lt;/a&gt; \"Cervus elaphus\", &lt;a href=\"wild%20boar\"&gt;wild boar&lt;/a&gt; \"Sus scrofa\") generally ingest whole fallen fruits but grind ingested seeds and mostly act as seed predators. Rodents also can act as post-dispersal predators of \"P. bourgaeana\" seeds. Seeds germinate &lt;a href=\"epigeal%20germination\"&gt;epigeally&lt;/a&gt; either shortly after dispersal, or even within fallen fruits, and do not appear to persist in the soil seed bank. Seedlings emerge from winter to early spring, and extensive mortality occurs on young seedlings due to summer droughts and fungal infection.\nThe strong aggregated patterning is thought to be the result of several non-exclusive processes. First, by creating the initial template on which post-dispersal processes act, its seed dispersers like foxes and badgers can be partially responsible for \"P. bourgaena\" aggregation. Second, dispersal limitation sometimes leads to seedling establishment beneath mother trees, resulting in an aggregated patterning. This is a likely possibility since a fraction of the fruit fallen beneath adult trees are not taken by mammals or are partially depulped by rabbits, without dispersing the seeds. Some seedlings emerge beneath mother trees every season and, eventually, a few of them get established. Finally, &lt;a href=\"rhizome\"&gt;rhizome&lt;/a&gt; sprouting in response to disturbance could result in clustering if different sprouts emerge from a single individual and eventually produce fruit. In the &lt;a href=\"Do%C3%B1ana%20National%20Park\"&gt;Do\u00f1ana National Park&lt;/a&gt; (Southwestern Spain), \"P. bourgaeana\" experience heavy browsing by red deer \"Cervus elaphus\" and sprouts of a range of sizes emerge beneath some trees. As those shoots grow could eventually reach the adult size leading to tree clustering.\nUses and threats.\nPear &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; (of any species) has one of the finest textures of the fruitwoods. It is prized for making &lt;a href=\"woodwind\"&gt;woodwind&lt;/a&gt; instruments, and pear veneer is used in fine furniture. In southern Spain, the Iberian pear has been used as &lt;a href=\"rootstock\"&gt;rootstock&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"grafting\"&gt;grafting&lt;/a&gt; pear &lt;a href=\"cultivar\"&gt;cultivar&lt;/a&gt;s. The fruit is not edible for people.\nThe major threats are urbanization and agricultural development."
