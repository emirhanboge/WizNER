    "text": " NELSPRUIT (Real Name) \nMbombela (previously known as Nelspruit) is a city in northeastern &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It is the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Mpumalanga\"&gt;Mpumalanga&lt;/a&gt; province. Located on the &lt;a href=\"Crocodile%20River%20%28Mpumalanga%29\"&gt;Crocodile River&lt;/a&gt;, Mbombela lies about by road west of the &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; border, east of &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg\"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; and about north of the &lt;a href=\"Eswatini\"&gt;Eswatini&lt;/a&gt; border. Mbombela was one of the host cities of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSan rock art and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20metallurgy%20in%20Africa\"&gt;Iron Age&lt;/a&gt; archaeological evidence indicate the Mbombela area has a long history of human habitation. Construction for the Mpumalanga legislature revealed farming settlements, storage pits, burial sites, and pottery ranging from the 6th to 17th century. The presence of cattle bones at the Riverside site is thought to be evidence that early Nguni practices of &lt;a href=\"Lobolo\"&gt;labola&lt;/a&gt; originated in eastern &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.\nMbombela was founded as Nelspruit in 1895 by three brothers of the Nel family who grazed their cattle around the site in the winter months. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Boer War&lt;/a&gt;, Nelspruit served briefly as the seat of government for the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Republic\"&gt;South African Republic&lt;/a&gt;, an independent &lt;a href=\"Boer%20Republics\"&gt;Boer republic&lt;/a&gt; (not to be confused with the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;Republic of South Africa&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe settlement was a key stopover for the Eastern Railway built by the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands-South%20African%20Railway%20Company\"&gt;Netherlands-South African Railway Company&lt;/a&gt; in the late 19th century which ran from the newly discovered &lt;a href=\"Witwatersrand\"&gt;Witwatersrand&lt;/a&gt; goldfields to Delagoa Bay in &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20East%20Africa\"&gt;Portuguese East Africa&lt;/a&gt; (modern-day &lt;a href=\"Maputo\"&gt;Maputo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;). The discovery of gold in Mpumalanga, such as at &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Rest%2C%20Mpumalanga\"&gt;Pilgrim's Rest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barberton%2C%20Mpumalanga\"&gt;Barberton&lt;/a&gt;, encouraged further development.\nThe history of what was then Nelspruit occurred along segregated lines. Under Apartheid\u2019s policy of &lt;a href=\"separate%20development\"&gt;separate development&lt;/a&gt;, Black people were forcibly removed from the town to Lekazi, &lt;a href=\"Kanyamazane\"&gt;Kanyamazane&lt;/a&gt;, and other outlying areas as menial labour reserve. In the early 1970s, Nelpark was formed as a Coloured district and Valencia as an Indian area in the town. Youth centers, public amenities, and schools such as Nelspruit Laerskool were reserved for the town\u2019s white population.\nName change.\nIn October 2009, the South African government renamed the city \"Mbombela\", the name of the &lt;a href=\"Mbombela%20Local%20Municipality\"&gt;local municipality&lt;/a&gt;. The Kruger Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism subsequently approached the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20of%20South%20Africa\"&gt;High Court of South Africa&lt;/a&gt; to challenge the decision, citing a lack of both consultation and city funds available to pay for road and website name changes. Ultimately, the name change was upheld in May 2014 by the &lt;a href=\"North%20Gauteng%20High%20Court\"&gt;North Gauteng High Court&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation and research institutions.\nMbombela has four major public &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20school\"&gt;high schools&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"TVET%20%28Technical%20and%20Vocational%20Education%20and%20Training%29\"&gt;TVET&lt;/a&gt; college (Ehlanzeni); more schools across all age groups are being built in response to overcrowding.\nThe city hosts the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Mpumalanga\"&gt;University of Mpumalanga&lt;/a&gt; (UMP). Established in 2014 with an intake of 140 students, it had over 4,300 students as of 2020. The &lt;a href=\"Tshwane%20University%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Tshwane University of Technology&lt;/a&gt; has a satellite campus in Mbombela with over 1,500 students, and &lt;a href=\"UNISA\"&gt;UNISA&lt;/a&gt; has an office offering &lt;a href=\"Online%20learning%20in%20higher%20education\"&gt;online courses&lt;/a&gt;.\nMbombela is home to the &lt;a href=\"Agricultural%20Research%20Council\"&gt;Agricultural Research Council&lt;/a&gt;'s Institute for Tropical and Subtropical Crops and the &lt;a href=\"Lowveld%20National%20Botanical%20Garden\"&gt;Lowveld National Botanical Garden&lt;/a&gt;. Citrus Research International (CRI) has a major facility in the city. The Lowveld College of Agriculture, located near UMP, also conducts research in the field of &lt;a href=\"botany\"&gt;botany&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransport.\nRoad.\nMbombela is on the &lt;a href=\"Maputo%20Corridor\"&gt;Maputo Corridor&lt;/a&gt;, a major trade route linking &lt;a href=\"Pretoria\"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Maputo\"&gt;Maputo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; which, with the &lt;a href=\"Trans-Kalahari%20Corridor\"&gt;Trans-Kalahari Corridor&lt;/a&gt;, forms a transport trunk that crosses the entire sub-continent from &lt;a href=\"Walvis%20Bay\"&gt;Walvis Bay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Namibia\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; to Maputo on the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"N4%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;N4 toll route&lt;/a&gt; is the main arterial route with a double lane highway all the way to &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg\"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; and Pretoria.\nThe new Northern Bypass was built for the N4 toll route, so the old road through the city centre (Samora Machel Drive) is now designated as the &lt;a href=\"R104%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;R104 route&lt;/a&gt;. Other roads in the area include the &lt;a href=\"R40%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;R40 route&lt;/a&gt; (which connects to &lt;a href=\"Barberton%2C%20Mpumalanga\"&gt;Barberton&lt;/a&gt;, a border with &lt;a href=\"Eswatini\"&gt;Eswatini&lt;/a&gt; in the south and with &lt;a href=\"White%20River%2C%20Mpumalanga\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt; in the north) and the &lt;a href=\"R37%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;R37 route&lt;/a&gt; (which connects to &lt;a href=\"Mashishing\"&gt;Mashishing&lt;/a&gt; in the north-west).\nRail.\nNelspruit railway station lies on the &lt;a href=\"Pretoria%E2%80%93Maputo%20railway\"&gt;Pretoria\u2013Maputo railway&lt;/a&gt;.\nAir.\n&lt;a href=\"Kruger%20Mpumalanga%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, located about north east of the city, began operations in October 2002. Scheduled flights operate to locations within South Africa and abroad (to &lt;a href=\"Zambia\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;). The complex has a runway which can accommodate aircraft up to the size of a &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20747\"&gt;Boeing 747&lt;/a&gt;. The airport currently handles about 250,000 passengers per annum.\n&lt;a href=\"Nelspruit%20Airport\"&gt;Nelspruit Airport&lt;/a&gt;, located about south west of the city, is the city's original airport owned and operated by the municipality. It primarily handles &lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt; aircraft, and several aircraft maintenance, firefighting, charter and training companies are based at the airport.\nTourism.\nMbombela is a major stopover point for tourists traveling to &lt;a href=\"Kruger%20National%20Park\"&gt;Kruger National Park&lt;/a&gt; and to Mozambique.

Mbombela is the nearest major South African city to Mozambique's capital, &lt;a href=\"Maputo\"&gt;Maputo&lt;/a&gt;, and as such Mbombela receives significant tourism from Mozambican locals.
