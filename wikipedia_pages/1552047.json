    "text": "A blowing snow advisory was issued by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Weather%20Service\"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; when wind driven &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; reduces surface visibility and possibly hampers traveling. &lt;a href=\"Blowing%20snow\"&gt;Blowing snow&lt;/a&gt; may be falling snow, or snow that has already accumulated but is picked up and blown by strong &lt;a href=\"wind\"&gt;wind&lt;/a&gt;s. This advisory was discontinued beginning with the 2008\u201309 winter storm season, replaced by the &lt;a href=\"winter%20weather%20advisory\"&gt;winter weather advisory&lt;/a&gt; for snow and blowing snow. However, if the storm is judged to be dangerous by local forecasters, a &lt;a href=\"winter%20storm%20warning\"&gt;winter storm warning&lt;/a&gt; for heavy snow and blowing snow may be issued.\nA similar bulletin is issued by &lt;a href=\"Environment%20Canada\"&gt;Environment Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Meteorological%20Service%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Meteorological Service of Canada&lt;/a&gt; but as a &lt;a href=\"weather%20warning\"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt;."
