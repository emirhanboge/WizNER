    "text": "Freesia is a &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"herbaceous\"&gt;herbaceous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"perennial\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt;s in the family &lt;a href=\"Iridaceae\"&gt;Iridaceae&lt;/a&gt;, first described as a genus in 1866 by &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Friedrich%20Ecklon\"&gt;Christian Friedrich Ecklon&lt;/a&gt; (1886) and named after the German botanist and medical practitioner, Friedrich Freese (1795-1876). It is native to the eastern side of southern Africa, from &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; south to &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, most species being found in &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Provinces\"&gt;Cape Provinces&lt;/a&gt;. Species of the former genus Anomatheca are now included in \"Freesia\". The plants commonly known as \"freesias\", with fragrant funnel-shaped flowers, are cultivated hybrids of a number of \"Freesia\" species. Some other species are also grown as ornamental plants.\nDescription.\nThey are &lt;a href=\"herbaceous\"&gt;herbaceous&lt;/a&gt; plants which grow from a conical &lt;a href=\"corm\"&gt;corm&lt;/a&gt; diameter, which sends up a tuft of narrow &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; long, and a sparsely branched stem tall bearing a few leaves and a loose one-sided spike of &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s with six &lt;a href=\"tepal\"&gt;tepal&lt;/a&gt;s. Many species have fragrant narrowly funnel-shaped &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, although those formerly placed in the genus \"Anomatheca\", such as \"&lt;a href=\"Freesia%20laxa\"&gt;F.\u00a0laxa&lt;/a&gt;\", have flat flowers.\nFreesias are used as food plants by the &lt;a href=\"larva\"&gt;larva&lt;/a&gt;e of some &lt;a href=\"Lepidoptera\"&gt;Lepidoptera&lt;/a&gt; species including the &lt;a href=\"large%20yellow%20underwing\"&gt;large yellow underwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nSystematics.\nThe genus was named in honor of &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Heinrich%20Theodor%20Freese\"&gt;Friedrich Heinrich Theodor Freese&lt;/a&gt; (1795\u20131876), a German physician.\nSpecies of the former genus \"Anomatheca\" are now included in \"Freesia\":\nCultivation and uses.\nThe plants usually called \"freesias\" in horticulture and floristry are derived from crosses made in the 19th century between \"Freesia refracta\" and \"Freesia leichtlinii\". Numerous &lt;a href=\"cultivar\"&gt;cultivar&lt;/a&gt;s have been bred from these species and the pink- and yellow-flowered forms of \"Freesia corymbosa\". Modern &lt;a href=\"tetraploid\"&gt;tetraploid&lt;/a&gt; cultivars have flowers ranging from white to yellow, pink, red and blue-mauve. They are mostly cultivated professionally in the Netherlands by about 80 growers. Freesias can be readily increased from seed. Due to their specific and pleasing scent, they are often used in hand creams, shampoos, candles, etc.; however, the flowers themselves are mainly used in wedding bouquets.\n\"Freesia laxa\" (formerly called \"Lapeirousia laxa\" or \"Anomatheca cruenta\") is one of the other species of the genus which is commonly cultivated. Smaller than the scented freesia cultivars, it has flat rather than cup-shaped flowers."
