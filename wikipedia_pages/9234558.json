    "text": "Burning Star is the debut album by American &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Helstar\"&gt;Helstar&lt;/a&gt; released by &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Records\"&gt;Combat&lt;/a&gt; in 1984. Recorded at Sunrise Studios in the band's hometown of Houston, the original cover featured a grim reaper-type of figure in a red robe holding a fireball and scythe. European and subsequent re-releases of the album feature a different cover with a spacecraft exploding.\nWhile the band's later releases leaned more towards a mix of &lt;a href=\"power%20metal\"&gt;power metal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"thrash%20metal\"&gt;thrash metal&lt;/a&gt; which the band became known for, their debut effort was more akin to traditional heavy metal with inklings of what was to come. The song \"Run With the Pack\" which ends side 1 on the original release is one of their most well-known songs and is played at every show.\nTrack listing.\nAll tracks written by Helstar."
