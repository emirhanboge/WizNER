    "text": "Frank Brown (born 1890) was an English &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and manager.\nBrown began his football career with &lt;a href=\"Barnsley%20F.C.\"&gt;Barnsley&lt;/a&gt; in 1910, moving to &lt;a href=\"Rotherham%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Rotherham County&lt;/a&gt; in 1914 and then to &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Huddersfield Town&lt;/a&gt; in 1915. In August 1919 he joined &lt;a href=\"Blackpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt;, but struggled to break into the first team and left to join &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Exeter City&lt;/a&gt; in May 1921. He stayed only one season at St. James' Park, moving to &lt;a href=\"Pontypridd%20F.C.\"&gt;Pontypridd&lt;/a&gt; in June 1922 before returning to &lt;a href=\"Devon\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; and joining &lt;a href=\"Torquay%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Torquay United&lt;/a&gt; in 1923.\nHe retired prior to Torquay achieving league status, but became the club's trainer and with &lt;a href=\"Percy%20Mackrill\"&gt;Percy Mackrill&lt;/a&gt; in charge saw United elected to the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt;. In May 1932 he was appointed manager of Torquay United, and during his six seasons at the helm at &lt;a href=\"Plainmoor\"&gt;Plainmoor&lt;/a&gt;, Torquay finished 10th 3 times, and 20th (out of 22 teams) 3 times.\nIn May 1938, Brown moved to the manager's chair at &lt;a href=\"Chester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Chester&lt;/a&gt;, leading them to 6th place in &lt;a href=\"Division%20Three%20%28North%29\"&gt;Division Three (North)&lt;/a&gt; and a second replay against &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the 4th round of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; in his first season. The &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; intervened in September 1939 with Chester unbeaten after 3 games of the new season, and Chester joined a regional league alongside the likes of &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;. When league football resumed, Chester finished the 1946\u201347 season in 3rd place and won the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Cup\"&gt;Welsh Cup&lt;/a&gt; the same year. However, the following seasons saw mid-table finishes at best as he struggled with the limited resources available. He eventually left Chester in May 1953, and was manager of &lt;a href=\"Stafford%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Stafford Rangers&lt;/a&gt; in 1954\u201355.\nHe died shortly after finishing his football managerial career."
