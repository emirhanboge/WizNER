    "text": "V\u00e1clav Havel (; 5 October 193618 December 2011) was a Czech statesman, playwright, and former &lt;a href=\"dissident\"&gt;dissident&lt;/a&gt;, who served as the last &lt;a href=\"president%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;president of Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; from 1989 until the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;dissolution of Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 and then as the first &lt;a href=\"president%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic\"&gt;president of the Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; from 1993 to 2003. He was the first democratically elected president of either country after the &lt;a href=\"Revolutions%20of%201989\"&gt;fall of communism&lt;/a&gt;. As a writer of &lt;a href=\"Czech%20literature\"&gt;Czech literature&lt;/a&gt;, he is known for his plays, essays, and memoirs.\nHis educational opportunities having been limited by his &lt;a href=\"bourgeois\"&gt;bourgeois&lt;/a&gt; background, when freedoms were limited by the &lt;a href=\"Czechoslovak%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Czechoslovak Socialist Republic&lt;/a&gt;, Havel first rose to prominence as a playwright. In works such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Garden%20Party%20%28play%29\"&gt;The Garden Party&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Memorandum\"&gt;The Memorandum&lt;/a&gt;\", Havel used an &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20of%20the%20Absurd\"&gt;absurdist&lt;/a&gt; style to criticize the Communist system. After participating in the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Spring\"&gt;Prague Spring&lt;/a&gt; and being blacklisted after the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;, he became more politically active and helped found several dissident initiatives, including &lt;a href=\"Charter%2077\"&gt;Charter 77&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Committee%20for%20the%20Defense%20of%20the%20Unjustly%20Prosecuted\"&gt;Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted&lt;/a&gt;. His political activities brought him under the surveillance of the &lt;a href=\"StB\"&gt;StB&lt;/a&gt; secret police, and he spent multiple periods as a &lt;a href=\"political%20prisoner\"&gt;political prisoner&lt;/a&gt;, the longest of his imprisoned terms being nearly four years, between 1979 and 1983.\nHavel's &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Forum\"&gt;Civic Forum&lt;/a&gt; party played a major role in the &lt;a href=\"Velvet%20Revolution\"&gt;Velvet Revolution&lt;/a&gt; that toppled the Communist system in Czechoslovakia in 1989. He assumed the presidency shortly thereafter, and was re-elected in a landslide the following year and after &lt;a href=\"Dissolution%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Slovak independence&lt;/a&gt; in 1993. Havel was instrumental in dismantling the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"enlargement%20of%20NATO\"&gt;enlargement of NATO&lt;/a&gt; membership eastward. Many of his stances and policies, such as his opposition to Slovak independence, condemnation of the treatment of &lt;a href=\"Sudeten%20Germans\"&gt;Sudeten Germans&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"expulsion%20of%20Germans%20from%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, and granting of general amnesty to all those imprisoned under the Communist era, were very controversial domestically. By the end of his presidency, he enjoyed greater popularity abroad than at home. Havel continued his life as a public intellectual after his presidency, launching several initiatives including the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Declaration%20on%20European%20Conscience%20and%20Communism\"&gt;Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism&lt;/a&gt;, the VIZE 97 Foundation, and the &lt;a href=\"Forum%202000\"&gt;Forum 2000&lt;/a&gt; annual conference.\nHavel's political philosophy was one of &lt;a href=\"anti-consumerism\"&gt;anti-consumerism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"humanitarianism\"&gt;humanitarianism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"environmentalism\"&gt;environmentalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"civil%20activism\"&gt;civil activism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"direct%20democracy\"&gt;direct democracy&lt;/a&gt;. He supported the Czech &lt;a href=\"Green%20Party%20%28Czech%20Republic%29\"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; from 2004 until his death. He received numerous accolades during his lifetime, including the &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Presidential Medal of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gandhi%20Peace%20Prize\"&gt;Gandhi Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Liberty%20Medal\"&gt;Philadelphia Liberty Medal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Order of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Freedoms%20Award\"&gt;Four Freedoms Award&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20of%20Conscience%20Award\"&gt;Ambassador of Conscience Award&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hanno%20R.%20Ellenbogen%20Citizenship%20Award\"&gt;Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award&lt;/a&gt;. The 2012\u20132013 academic year at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Europe\"&gt;College of Europe&lt;/a&gt; was named in his honour. He is considered by some to be one of the most important intellectuals of the 20th century. The international &lt;a href=\"airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; was renamed to &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A1clav%20Havel%20Airport%20Prague\"&gt;V\u00e1clav Havel Airport Prague&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.\nEarly life.\nHavel was born in &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; on 5 October 1936 into a wealthy family celebrated in Czechoslovakia for its entrepreneurial and cultural accomplishments. His grandfather, V\u00e1cslav Havel, a real estate developer, built a landmark entertainment complex on Prague's Wenceslas Square. His father, V\u00e1clav Maria Havel, was the real estate developer behind the suburban &lt;a href=\"Barrandov%20Terraces\"&gt;Barrandov Terraces&lt;/a&gt;, located on the highest point of Prague\u2014next door to which his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Milo%C5%A1%20Havel\"&gt;Milo\u0161 Havel&lt;/a&gt;, built one of the largest film studios in Europe. Havel's mother, Bo\u017eena Vavre\u010dkov\u00e1, also came from an influential family; her father was a Czechoslovak ambassador and a well-known journalist.\nIn the early 1950s, because of his &lt;a href=\"Social%20class\"&gt;class background&lt;/a&gt;, Havel entered into a four-year apprenticeship as a chemical laboratory assistant and simultaneously took evening classes at a &lt;a href=\"Gymnasium%20%28school%29%23Czech%20Republic%20%26amp%3B%20Slovakia\"&gt;gymnasium&lt;/a&gt;. He completed his secondary education in 1954. For political reasons, he was not accepted into any post-secondary school with a humanities program; therefore, he opted for studies at the Faculty of Economics of the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Technical%20University%20in%20Prague\"&gt;Czech Technical University in Prague&lt;/a&gt; but dropped out after two years. On 9 July 1964, Havel married &lt;a href=\"Olga%20Havlov%C3%A1\"&gt;Olga \u0160pl\u00edchalov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly theatre career.\nThe intellectual tradition of his family was essential for Havel's lifetime adherence to the humanitarian values of the Czech culture. After finishing his &lt;a href=\"military%20service\"&gt;military service&lt;/a&gt; (1957\u201359), Havel had to bring his intellectual ambitions in line with the given circumstances, especially with the restrictions imposed on him as a descendant of a bourgeois family. He found employment in Prague's theatre world as a &lt;a href=\"stagehand\"&gt;stagehand&lt;/a&gt; at Prague's Theatre ABC\u00a0\u2013 \"Divadlo ABC\", and then at the Theatre on Balustrade\u00a0\u2013 \"Divadlo Na z\u00e1bradl\u00ed\". Simultaneously, he was a student of dramatic arts by correspondence at the Theatre Faculty of the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Performing%20Arts%20in%20Prague\"&gt;Academy of Performing Arts in Prague&lt;/a&gt; (DAMU). His first own full-length play performed in public, besides various vaudeville collaborations, was \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Garden%20Party%20%28play%29\"&gt;The Garden Party&lt;/a&gt;\" (1963). Presented in a series of &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20of%20the%20Absurd\"&gt;Theatre of the Absurd&lt;/a&gt;, at the Theatre on Balustrade, this play won him international acclaim. The play was soon followed by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Memorandum\"&gt;The Memorandum&lt;/a&gt;\", one of his best known plays, and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Increased%20Difficulty%20of%20Concentration%20%28play%29\"&gt;The Increased Difficulty of Concentration&lt;/a&gt;\", all at the Theatre on Balustrade. In 1968, \"The Memorandum\" was also brought to &lt;a href=\"The%20Public%20Theater\"&gt;The Public Theater&lt;/a&gt; in New York, which helped to establish Havel's reputation in the United States. The Public Theater continued to produce his plays in the following years. After 1968, Havel's plays were banned from the theatre world in his own country, and he was unable to leave Czechoslovakia to see any foreign performances of his works.\nPolitical dissident.\nDuring the first week of the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; in August 1968, Havel assisted the resistance by providing an on-air narrative via Radio Free Czechoslovakia station (at &lt;a href=\"Liberec\"&gt;Liberec&lt;/a&gt;). Following the suppression of the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Spring\"&gt;Prague Spring&lt;/a&gt; in 1968, he was banned from the theatre and became more politically active. He took a job at &lt;a href=\"Pivovar%20Krakono%C5%A1\"&gt;Krakono\u0161&lt;/a&gt; brewery in &lt;a href=\"Trutnov\"&gt;Trutnov&lt;/a&gt;, an experience he wrote about in his play \"Audience\". This play, along with two other \"Van\u011bk\" plays (so-called because of the recurring character &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Van%C4%9Bk\"&gt;Ferdinand Van\u011bk&lt;/a&gt;, a stand in for Havel), became distributed in &lt;a href=\"samizdat\"&gt;samizdat&lt;/a&gt; form across Czechoslovakia, and greatly added to Havel's reputation of being a leading dissident (several other Czech writers later wrote their own plays featuring Van\u011bk). This reputation was cemented with the publication of the \"&lt;a href=\"Charter%2077\"&gt;Charter 77&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"manifesto\"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, written partially in response to the imprisonment of members of the Czech &lt;a href=\"psychedelic%20rock\"&gt;psychedelic rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"The%20Plastic%20People%20of%20the%20Universe\"&gt;The Plastic People of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;; Havel had attended their trial, which centered on the group's non-conformity in having long hair, using obscenities in their music, and their overall involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Prague%20underground%20%28movement%29\"&gt;Prague underground&lt;/a&gt; movement. Havel co-founded the &lt;a href=\"Committee%20for%20the%20Defense%20of%20the%20Unjustly%20Prosecuted\"&gt;Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. His political activities resulted in multiple imprisonments by the authorities, and constant government surveillance and questioning by the secret police (&lt;a href=\"St%C3%A1tn%C3%AD%20bezpe%C4%8Dnost\"&gt;St\u00e1tn\u00ed bezpe\u010dnost&lt;/a&gt;). His longest period in prison, from May 1979 to February 1983, is documented in letters to his wife that were later published as \"&lt;a href=\"Letters%20to%20Olga\"&gt;Letters to Olga&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe was known for his essays, most particularly \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Power%20of%20the%20Powerless\"&gt;The Power of the Powerless&lt;/a&gt;\" (1978), in which he described a societal paradigm in which citizens were forced to \"live within a lie\" under the Communist regime. In describing his role as a dissident, Havel wrote in 1979: \"we never decided to become dissidents. We have been transformed into them, without quite knowing how, sometimes we have ended up in prison without precisely knowing how. We simply went ahead and did certain things that we felt we ought to do, and that seemed to us decent to do, nothing more nor less.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Beckett\"&gt;Samuel Beckett&lt;/a&gt;'s 1982 short play, \"&lt;a href=\"Catastrophe%20%28play%29\"&gt;Catastrophe&lt;/a&gt;\", was dedicated to Havel while he was held as a &lt;a href=\"political%20prisoner\"&gt;political prisoner&lt;/a&gt; in Czechoslovakia.\nPresidency.\nOn 29 December 1989, while he was leader of the &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Forum\"&gt;Civic Forum&lt;/a&gt;, Havel became President of Czechoslovakia by a unanimous vote of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Assembly%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Federal Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. He had long insisted that he was not interested in politics and had argued that political change in the country should be induced through autonomous civic initiatives rather than through the official institutions. In 1990, soon after his election, Havel was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Prize%20For%20Freedom\"&gt;Prize For Freedom&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20International\"&gt;Liberal International&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1990, Czechoslovakia held &lt;a href=\"1990%20Czechoslovakian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;its first free elections in 44 years&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a sweeping victory for Civic Forum and its Slovak counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Public%20Against%20Violence\"&gt;Public Against Violence&lt;/a&gt;. Between them, they commanded strong majorities in both houses of the legislature, and tallied the highest popular vote share recorded for a free election in the country. Havel retained his presidency.\nDespite increasing political tensions between the Czechs and the Slovaks in 1992, Havel supported the retention of the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20and%20Slovak%20Federative%20Republic\"&gt;Czech and Slovak Federative Republic&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"Dissolution%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;dissolution of the country&lt;/a&gt;. Havel sought re-election in 1992. Although no other candidate filed, when the vote came on 3 July, he failed to get a majority due to a lack of support from Slovak deputies. The largest Czech political party, the &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Czech%20Republic%29\"&gt;Civic Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, let it be known that it would not support any other candidate. After the Slovaks issued their Declaration of Independence, he resigned as president on 20 July, saying that he would not preside over the country's breakup.\nHowever, when the Czech Republic was created as one of two successor states, he stood for election as its first president on 26 January 1993, and won. Although he was nominally the new country's chief executive, the framers of the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Constitution of the Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; intended to vest most of the real power in the prime minister. However, owing to his prestige, he still commanded great &lt;a href=\"moral%20authority\"&gt;moral authority&lt;/a&gt;, and the presidency acquired a greater role than the framers intended. For instance, largely due to his influence, the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Bohemia%20and%20Moravia\"&gt;Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia&lt;/a&gt; (KSCM), successor to the KSC's branch in the Czech Lands, was kept on the margins for most of his presidency. Havel suspected that the KSCM was still an unreformed Stalinist party.\nHavel's popularity abroad surpassed his popularity at home, and he was often the object of controversy and criticism. During his time in office, Havel stated that the expulsion of the indigenous &lt;a href=\"Sudeten%20German\"&gt;Sudeten German&lt;/a&gt; population after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; was immoral, causing a great controversy at home. He also extended general amnesty as one of his first acts as president, in an attempt to lessen the pressure in overcrowded prisons as well as to release political prisoners and persons who may have been falsely imprisoned during the Communist era. Havel felt that many of the decisions by the previous regime's courts should not be trusted, and that most of those in prison had not received fair trials. However, critics claimed that this amnesty led to a significant increase in the crime rate: the total number of crimes doubled, as did the number of murders. Several of the worst crimes in the history of the Czech criminology were committed by criminals released in this amnesty. Within four years of the &lt;a href=\"Velvet%20revolution\"&gt;Velvet revolution&lt;/a&gt; (and following another two amnesties declared by Havel), criminality had more than tripled since 1989. According to Havel's memoir \"To the Castle and Back\", most of those who were released had less than a year to serve before their sentences ended, but statistics contradict Havel's claims.\nIn an interview with Karel Hv\u00ed\u017e\u010fala (included in \"To the Castle and Back\"), Havel expressed his feeling that it was his most important accomplishment as president to have contributed to the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt;. According to his statement the dissolution was very complicated. The infrastructure created by the Warsaw Pact was part of the economies of all member states, and the Pact's dissolution necessitated restructuring that took many years to complete. Furthermore, it took time to dismantle the Warsaw Pact's institutions; for example, it took two years for Soviet troops to fully withdraw from Czechoslovakia.\nFollowing a legal dispute with his sister-in-law Dagmar Havlov\u00e1 (wife of his brother Ivan M. Havel), Havel decided to sell his 50% stake in the &lt;a href=\"Lucerna%20Palace\"&gt;Lucerna Palace&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Wenceslas%20Square\"&gt;Wenceslas Square&lt;/a&gt; in Prague, built from 1907 to 1921 by his grandfather, also named V\u00e1clav Havel (spelled V\u00e1cslav,) one of the multifunctional \"palaces\" in the center of the once booming pre-World War I Prague. In a transaction arranged by &lt;a href=\"Mari%C3%A1n%20%C4%8Calfa\"&gt;Mari\u00e1n \u010calfa&lt;/a&gt;, Havel sold the estate to &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A1clav%20Junek\"&gt;V\u00e1clav Junek&lt;/a&gt;, a former Communist &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt; in France and head of the soon-to-be bankrupt &lt;a href=\"conglomerate%20%28company%29\"&gt;conglomerate&lt;/a&gt; Chemapol Group, who later openly admitted that he &lt;a href=\"bribed\"&gt;bribed&lt;/a&gt; politicians of the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Social%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Czech Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis near friend was &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Medek\"&gt;Ivan Medek&lt;/a&gt;, who become the chef of the president office.\nIn January 1996, &lt;a href=\"Olga%20Havlov%C3%A1\"&gt;Olga Havlov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, his wife of 32 years, died of cancer at 62. In December 1996, Havel who had been a &lt;a href=\"chain%20smoker\"&gt;chain smoker&lt;/a&gt; for a long time, was diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"lung%20cancer\"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The disease reappeared two years later. He quit smoking. In 1997, he remarried, to actress &lt;a href=\"Dagmar%20Havlov%C3%A1\"&gt;Dagmar Ve\u0161krnov\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;.\nHavel was among those influential politicians who contributed most to the transition of &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; from being an anti-&lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt; alliance to its present form. Havel advocated vigorously for the inclusion of former-Warsaw Pact members, like the Czech Republic, into the Western alliance.\nHavel was re-elected president in 1998. He had to undergo a &lt;a href=\"colostomy\"&gt;colostomy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Innsbruck\"&gt;Innsbruck&lt;/a&gt; when his colon ruptured while he was on holiday in Austria. On 30 January 2003, Havel signed \"&lt;a href=\"The%20letter%20of%20the%20eight\"&gt;The letter of the eight&lt;/a&gt;\". Havel left office after his second term as Czech president ended on 2 February 2003. &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A1clav%20Klaus\"&gt;V\u00e1clav Klaus&lt;/a&gt;, one of his greatest political adversaries, was elected his successor as president on 28 February 2003. &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Thatcher\"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt; wrote of the two men in her foreign policy treatise \"&lt;a href=\"Statecraft%20%28book%29\"&gt;Statecraft&lt;/a&gt;\", reserving the greater respect for Havel. Havel's dedication to democracy and his steadfast opposition to &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; ideology earned him admiration.\nPost-presidential career.\nBeginning in 1997, Havel hosted Forum 2000, an annual conference to \"identify the key issues facing civilisation and to explore ways to prevent the escalation of conflicts that have religion, culture or ethnicity as their primary components\". In 2005, the former president occupied the Kluge Chair for Modern Culture at the &lt;a href=\"John%20W.%20Kluge%20Center\"&gt;John W. Kluge Center&lt;/a&gt; of the United States &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Congress\"&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt;, where he continued his research on human rights. In November and December 2006, Havel spent eight weeks as a visiting &lt;a href=\"artist%20in%20residence\"&gt;artist in residence&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20University\"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;. The stay was sponsored by the Columbia Arts Initiative and featured \"performances, and panels centr[ing] on his life and ideas\", including a public \"conversation\" with former U.S. President &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. Concurrently, the Untitled Theater Company No. 61 launched a Havel Festival, the first complete festival of his plays in various venues throughout New York City, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Brick%20Theater\"&gt;The Brick Theater&lt;/a&gt; and the Ohio Theatre, in celebration of his 70th birthday. Havel was a member of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Future%20Society\"&gt;World Future Society&lt;/a&gt; and addressed the Society's members on 4 July 1994. His speech was later printed in THE FUTURIST magazine (July 1995).\nHavel remained an admired individual by Czech citizens. In \"&lt;a href=\"Nejv%C4%9Bt%C5%A1%C3%AD%20%C4%8Cech\"&gt;The Greatest Czech&lt;/a&gt;\" TV show (the Czech spin-off of the BBC \"&lt;a href=\"100%20Greatest%20Britons\"&gt;100 Greatest Britons&lt;/a&gt;\" show) in 2005, Havel received the third biggest amount of voices, so he was elected to be third greatest Czech when he was still alive.\nHavel's memoir of his experience as president, \"To the Castle and Back\", was published in May 2007. The book mixes an interview in the style of \"Disturbing the Peace\" with actual memoranda he sent to his staff and modern diary entries and recollections.\nOn 4 August 2007, Havel met with members of the &lt;a href=\"Belarus%20Free%20Theatre\"&gt;Belarus Free Theatre&lt;/a&gt; at his summer cottage in the Czech Republic in a show of his continuing support, which has been instrumental in the theatre's attaining international recognition and membership in the &lt;a href=\"European%20Theatrical%20Convention\"&gt;European Theatrical Convention&lt;/a&gt;.\nHavel went on a hunger strike in 2007 to support Kurdish doctor and human rights activist &lt;a href=\"Yekta%20Uzuno%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Yekta Uzunoglu&lt;/a&gt; in his legal battle. A former president going on a hunger strike to support the legal battle of a foreigner in his country was a first in world history.\nHavel's first new play in almost two decades, \"&lt;a href=\"Leaving%20%28play%29\"&gt;Leaving&lt;/a&gt;\", was published in November 2007, and was to have had its world premiere in June 2008 at the Prague theater &lt;a href=\"Vinohrady%20Theatre\"&gt;Divadlo na Vinohradech&lt;/a&gt;, but the theater withdrew it in December as it felt it could not provide the technical support needed to mount the play. The play instead premiered on 22 May 2008 at the &lt;a href=\"Archa%20Theatre\"&gt;Archa Theatre&lt;/a&gt; to standing ovations. Havel based the play on \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Lear\"&gt;King Lear&lt;/a&gt;\", by &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;, and on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cherry%20Orchard\"&gt;The Cherry Orchard&lt;/a&gt;\", by &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Chekhov\"&gt;Anton Chekhov&lt;/a&gt;; \"Chancellor Vil\u00e9m Rieger is the central character of \"Leaving\", who faces a crisis after being removed from political power.\" The play had its English language premiere at the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Tree%20Theatre\"&gt;Orange Tree Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in London and its American premiere at &lt;a href=\"The%20Wilma%20Theater\"&gt;The Wilma Theater&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. Havel subsequently directed a film version of the play, which premiered in the Czech Republic on 22 March 2011.\nOther works included the short sketch \"P\u011bt Tet\", a modern sequel to \"Unveiling\", and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pig%2C%20or%20V%C3%A1clav%20Havel%27s%20Hunt%20for%20a%20Pig\"&gt;The Pig, or V\u00e1clav Havel's Hunt for a Pig&lt;/a&gt;\", which was premiered in &lt;a href=\"Brno\"&gt;Brno&lt;/a&gt; at Theatre Goose on a String and had its English language premiere at the 3LD Art &amp; Technology Center in New York, in a production from Untitled Theater Company No. 61, in a production workshopped in the Ice Factory Festival in 2011 and later revived as a full production in 2014, becoming a \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" Critic's Pick.\nIn 2008, Havel became a Member of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Council%20on%20Tolerance%20and%20Reconciliation\"&gt;European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation&lt;/a&gt;.

Havel was the chair of the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Rights%20Foundation\"&gt;Human Rights Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s International Council and a member of the international advisory council of the &lt;a href=\"Victims%20of%20Communism%20Memorial%20Foundation\"&gt;Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.\nHavel was a supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Campaign%20for%20the%20Establishment%20of%20a%20United%20Nations%20Parliamentary%20Assembly\"&gt;Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. From the 1980s, Havel supported the &lt;a href=\"green%20politics\"&gt;green politics&lt;/a&gt; movement, partly due to his friendship with the co-founder of the German &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%2790/The%20Greens\"&gt;Alliance '90/The Greens&lt;/a&gt; party &lt;a href=\"Milan%20Hor%C3%A1%C4%8Dek\"&gt;Milan Hor\u00e1\u010dek&lt;/a&gt;.

Merkel called Havel \"a great European\", while Wa\u0142\u0119sa said he should have been given the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Peace%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt;. The Russian Embassy sent an official condolence on behalf of the President &lt;a href=\"Dmitry%20Medvedev\"&gt;Dmitry Medvedev&lt;/a&gt; and Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt news of his death, former U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a href=\"Madeleine%20Albright\"&gt;Madeleine Albright&lt;/a&gt;, a native of Czechoslovakia, said, \"He was one of the great figures of the 20th Century\", while Czech expatriate novelist &lt;a href=\"Milan%20Kundera\"&gt;Milan Kundera&lt;/a&gt; said, \"V\u00e1clav Havel's most important work is his own life.\" Communists took the opportunity to criticize Havel. &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Bohemia%20and%20Moravia\"&gt;Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Vojt%C4%9Bch%20Filip\"&gt;Vojt\u011bch Filip&lt;/a&gt; stated that Havel was a very controversial person and that his words often conflicted with his deeds. He criticized Havel for having supported the &lt;a href=\"NATO%20bombing%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;NATO bombing of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, repeating the charge that Havel had called the event a \"humanitarian bombing\", although Havel had expressly and emphatically denied ever using such a phrase.\nAn online petition organized by one of the best-known Czech and Slovak film directors, &lt;a href=\"Fero%20Feni%C4%8D\"&gt;Fero Feni\u010d&lt;/a&gt;, calling on the government and the Parliament to rename &lt;a href=\"Prague%20Ruzyn%C4%9B%20Airport\"&gt;Prague Ruzyn\u011b Airport&lt;/a&gt; to V\u00e1clav Havel International Airport attracted\u2014in a week after 20 December 2011\u2014support of over 80,000 Czech Republic and foreign signatories. It was announced that the airport would be renamed the V\u00e1clav Havel Airport Prague on 5 October 2012.\nReviewing a new biography by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20%C5%BDantovsk%C3%BD\"&gt;Michael \u017dantovsk\u00fd&lt;/a&gt;, Yale historian Marci Shore summarized his challenges as president: \"Havel's message, 'We are all responsible, we are all guilty,' was not popular. He enacted a general amnesty for all but the most serious criminals, apologized on behalf of Czechoslovakia for the post-World War II expulsion of the Sudeten Germans and resisted demands for a more draconian purge of secret police collaborators. These things were not popular either. And as the government undertook privatization and restitution, Havel confronted pyramid schemes, financial corruption and robber baron capitalism. He saw his country fall apart (if bloodlessly), becoming in 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\"\nAwards.\nHavel was elected to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in 1983.

In his acceptance speech, he said: \"The idea of human rights and freedoms must be an integral part of any meaningful world order. Yet I think it must be anchored in a different place, and in a different way, than has been the case so far. If it is to be more than just a slogan mocked by half the world, it cannot be expressed in the language of departing era, and it must not be mere froth floating on the subsiding waters of faith in a purely scientific relationship to the world.\"\nHavel was elected to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Philosophical%20Society\"&gt;American Philosophical Society&lt;/a&gt; in 1995.\nIn 1997, Havel received ex aequo the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Asturias%20Awards\"&gt;Prince of Asturias Award&lt;/a&gt; for Communication and Humanities and the &lt;a href=\"Prix%20mondial%20Cino%20Del%20Duca\"&gt;Prix mondial Cino Del Duca&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2001, he was elected to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2002, he was the third recipient of the &lt;a href=\"Hanno%20R.%20Ellenbogen%20Citizenship%20Award\"&gt;Hanno R.
