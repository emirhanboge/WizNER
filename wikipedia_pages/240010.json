    "text": "Lonicera morrowii, the Morrow's honeysuckle, is a &lt;a href=\"deciduous\"&gt;deciduous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"honeysuckle\"&gt;honeysuckle&lt;/a&gt; in the family &lt;a href=\"Caprifoliaceae\"&gt;Caprifoliaceae&lt;/a&gt;, native to &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20China\"&gt;Northeast China&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt;, reaching a height of 2\u20132.5\u00a0m, with oblong &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20136\u00a0cm long. It leafs out quite early in the spring, and in North America is commonly the first deciduous shrub with foliage in March. The &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are white to pale yellow, and the &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; is a dark red &lt;a href=\"berry%20%28botany%29\"&gt;berry&lt;/a&gt; 7\u20138\u00a0mm diameter containing numerous &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s. The berries, while eaten frequently by birds, are considered poisonous to humans. It is colloquially called \"bush honeysuckle\" in the United States, and is considered an &lt;a href=\"invasive%20species\"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn cultivation, \"Lonicera morrowii\" has hybridized with other shrubby species of \"Lonicera\". Crossed with \"&lt;a href=\"Lonicera%20tatarica\"&gt;L.\u00a0tatarica&lt;/a&gt;\", it forms the invasive hybrid &lt;a href=\"Lonicera%20%C3%97%20bella\"&gt;\"L.\" \u00d7 \"bella\"&lt;/a&gt;. It can also hybridize with \"&lt;a href=\"Lonicera%20ruprechtiana\"&gt;L.\u00a0ruprechtiana&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAs an invasive species.\nMorrow's honeysuckle is confirmed as a highly invasive species over the northeastern third of the United States. Morrow's honeysuckle thrives at the edges of forests, roads, or other natural or man-made barriers, but is not limited to them, and is found in both mature and disturbed forests. In some areas, Morrow's honeysuckle is the dominant plant species, especially in areas of disturbed &lt;a href=\"ecological%20succession\"&gt;ecological succession&lt;/a&gt;. It is suspected that \"Lonicera morrowii\" is &lt;a href=\"allelopathic\"&gt;allelopathic&lt;/a&gt;, and may capitalize on disturbed ecological succession by establishing itself and then preventing the growth of plants underneath it. With a sufficiently established thicket of honeysuckle, even other shade-tolerant, invasive species, such as &lt;a href=\"Euonymus%20fortunei\"&gt;fortune's spindle&lt;/a&gt; have difficulty growing underneath it, whether due to its suspected allelopathic activity or through soil depletion.\nEffects on flora and fauna.\nDue to its early leafing, Morrow's honeysuckle is particularly harmful to &lt;a href=\"spring%20ephemeral\"&gt;spring ephemeral&lt;/a&gt;s, flowers that evolved to bloom briefly in the spring before other plants leafed out.\nMany &lt;a href=\"cedar%20waxwing\"&gt;cedar waxwing&lt;/a&gt;s' wax spots in the eastern United States have taken on an unusual orange hue in the last 35 years, a phenomenon that has been attributed to \"Lonicera morrowii\". The chemical involved in this color change is &lt;a href=\"rhodoxanthin\"&gt;rhodoxanthin&lt;/a&gt;, a red dye found in the berries of Morrow's honeysuckle."
