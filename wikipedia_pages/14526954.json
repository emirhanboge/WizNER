    "text": "Anarchism in India has never taken the name \"anarchism\", and is relevant primarily from its effects on movements for &lt;a href=\"Indian%20independence%20movement\"&gt;national&lt;/a&gt; and social liberation.\nVedic Anarchism.\nThe &lt;a href=\"rishis\"&gt;rishis&lt;/a&gt; who have given Vedas are the first founders of Vedic anarchist societies. They dwelled in forests outside the control of any state or governments, and enforced a values based living through the knowledge on &lt;a href=\"Rta\"&gt;Rta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dharma\"&gt;dharma&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the Western anarchism that emphasises priority to anti-state and anti-rulers policies, Vedic Anarchism deals with balance of powers, non-hierarchical and decentralised polity, community living, and ecologically sustainable lifestyles through its &lt;a href=\"Varna%20%28Hinduism%29\"&gt;varna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ashrama%20%28stage%29\"&gt;ashrama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dharma\"&gt;dharma&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Janapada\"&gt;Janapada&lt;/a&gt; systems.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Janapada\"&gt;Janapada&lt;/a&gt; system created a non-hierarchical and decentralised polity of root-level democracy.\nEach of the Janapadas was named after the Kshatriya tribe (or the Kshatriya Jana) who had settled therein. Within each Janapadas existed the Varna system distributing the socioeconomic powers, creating village communities that are completely independent from the state and completely inter-dependent within itself.\nThe Vedic polity of root-level democracy has turned the entire India as a community and village based society. These villages are completely self-sufficient, self-governing (&lt;a href=\"swaraj\"&gt;swaraj&lt;/a&gt;), cooperative, nature bound, and ensured complete independence from the state and its politics. Thomas Munroe, Charles Metcalfe, and Mark Wilks are a few of the Orientalists who have eloquently described this importance village communities held in India.\nBecause of the Janapada system, anarchism ruled the roots and roosts of India irrespective of kings and other types of rulers. Its influence is very strong and far reaching, even in the colonial period, the colonialists found that the establishment of Vedic anarchism through its village communities as the most difficult barrier to break and could not completely enforce their hegemony.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20cosmology\"&gt;Hindu cosmology&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Satya%20Yuga\"&gt;Satya Yuga&lt;/a&gt; described a possible stateless society where people were governed only by the \"universal natural law of &lt;a href=\"dharma\"&gt;dharma&lt;/a&gt;\". Where much of Hindu political philosophy upheld the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20right%20of%20kings%23Hinduism%20and%20Indic%20religions\"&gt;divine right of kings&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Chanakya\"&gt;Chanakya&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sutra\"&gt;sutra&lt;/a&gt;s held that \"it is better to not to have a king then have one who is wanting in discipline\", in contrast to the western notion of monarchical rites.\nGandhi and anarchism.\nThe local conditions were pertinent to the development of the heavily anarchic &lt;a href=\"Satyagraha\"&gt;Satyagraha movement&lt;/a&gt; in India. &lt;a href=\"George%20Woodcock\"&gt;George Woodcock&lt;/a&gt; claimed &lt;a href=\"Mohandas%20Karamchand%20Gandhi\"&gt;Mohandas Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; self-identified as an anarchist. Gandhi also considered Leo Tolstoy's book, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Kingdom%20of%20God%20is%20Within%20You\"&gt;The Kingdom of God is Within You&lt;/a&gt;\", a book about practical anarchist organisation, as the text to have the most influence in his life.\nTo Gandhi, the root of all social problems lay in violence and therefore in the state, which maintains a &lt;a href=\"monopoly%20on%20violence\"&gt;monopoly on violence&lt;/a&gt;, holding that \"the nearest approach to purest anarchy would be a democracy based on nonviolence.\" He advocated for the implementation of \"&lt;a href=\"Swaraj\"&gt;Swaraj&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"self-governance\"&gt;self-governance&lt;/a&gt;) starting with individuals, before moving up through the village, region and finally the national level. \"Swaraj\" was thus based in a form of &lt;a href=\"individualist%20anarchism\"&gt;individualist anarchism&lt;/a&gt;, rejecting &lt;a href=\"majority%20rule\"&gt;majority rule&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20sovereignty\"&gt;parliamentarism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"political%20parties\"&gt;political parties&lt;/a&gt;, while holding that individual morality should be the guiding force of the wider society and that any collective organization should be subordinate to the will of the individuals which make it up.\nIn his essay \"Reflections on Gandhi\" (1949), &lt;a href=\"George%20Orwell\"&gt;George Orwell&lt;/a&gt; noted that anarchists and &lt;a href=\"pacifists\"&gt;pacifists&lt;/a&gt; had claimed Gandhi as an adherent of their own traditions, but argued that in doing so they ignored \"the other-worldly, &lt;a href=\"anti-humanist\"&gt;anti-humanist&lt;/a&gt; tendency of his doctrines.\" Orwell argued that &lt;a href=\"Gandhian%20thought\"&gt;Gandhian thought&lt;/a&gt; required religious belief, and so could not be reconciled with anarchists' &lt;a href=\"humanism\"&gt;humanism&lt;/a&gt;.\nBhagat Singh.\nBefore 1920, a partly anarchist inspired movement was represented by one of the most famous &lt;a href=\"revolutionary\"&gt;revolutionaries&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20independence%20movement\"&gt;Indian independence movement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bhagat%20Singh\"&gt;Bhagat Singh&lt;/a&gt;. Though a &lt;a href=\"Marxism\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt;, Bhagat Singh was attracted to anarchism. Western anarchism and &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communism&lt;/a&gt; had influence on him. He studied the writings of &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Bakunin\"&gt;Mikhail Bakunin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Marx\"&gt;Karl Marx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Lenin\"&gt;Vladimir Lenin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leon%20Trotsky\"&gt;Leon Trotsky&lt;/a&gt;. Singh wrote in an article:\nSingh was involved in the &lt;a href=\"Hindustan%20Socialist%20Republican%20Association\"&gt;Hindustan Socialist Republican Association&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naujawan%20Bharat%20Sabha\"&gt;Naujawan Bharat Sabha&lt;/a&gt; (Translated to 'Youth Society of India'). By the mid-1920s Singh began arming of the general population and organised people's militias against the British. From May 1928 to September 1928, Singh published several articles on anarchism in Punjabi periodical \"Kirti\".\nHar Dayal's anarchist activism in US.\nIndian revolutionary and the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Ghadar%20Party\"&gt;Ghadar Party&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Har%20Dayal\"&gt;Lala Har Dayal&lt;/a&gt; was involved in the &lt;a href=\"Anarchism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;anarchist movement in United States&lt;/a&gt;. He moved to the United States in 1911, where he became involved in &lt;a href=\"industrial%20unionism\"&gt;industrial unionism&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Oakland\"&gt;Oakland&lt;/a&gt;, he founded the \"Bakunin Institute of California\" which he described as \"the first &lt;a href=\"monastery\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; of anarchism\". The organisation aligned itself with the \"Regeneracion\" movement founded by the exiled &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexicans&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ricardo%20Flores%20Magon\"&gt;Ricardo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enrique%20Flores%20Mag%C3%B3n\"&gt;Enrique Flores Mag\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Har%20Dayal\"&gt;Har Dayal&lt;/a&gt; understood the realisation of ancient \"&lt;a href=\"Arya%20%28spiritual%29\"&gt;Aryan&lt;/a&gt;\" culture as anarchism, which he also saw as the goal of &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ghadar%20Party\"&gt;Ghadar Party&lt;/a&gt; attempted to overthrow the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; by reconciling western concepts of social revolution - particularly those stemming from &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Bakunin\"&gt;Mikhail Bakunin&lt;/a&gt; - with Buddhism.\nMPT Acharya.\nMPT Acharya was a contemporary of Har Dayal in London and fellow revolutionary in &lt;a href=\"India%20House\"&gt;India House&lt;/a&gt;. Like a number of other Indian revolutionaries of the time, Acharya turned to socialism at the end of first world war to aid the Indian cause. However he was disillusioned by the communist movement and by the early 1920s had turned towards &lt;a href=\"Anarchism\"&gt;Anarchism&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Virendranath%20Chattopadhyaya\"&gt;Virendranath Chattopadhyaya&lt;/a&gt;. He took an active role in promoting Anarchist works in and was contributed at this time to the Russian &lt;a href=\"Anarchist\"&gt;Anarchist&lt;/a&gt; publication &lt;a href=\"Rabotchi%20Put\"&gt;Rabotchi Put&lt;/a&gt;. In 1931, he lived in Amsterdam working with the school of Anarcho-syndicalism. Acharya came to be acquainted in early 1930s acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Marxist\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt;-leaning Indian industrialist from Bombay, &lt;a href=\"Ranchoddas%20Bhavan%20Lotvala\"&gt;Ranchoddas Bhavan Lotvala&lt;/a&gt;. Lotvala had financed \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Socialist%20%28Indian%20newspaper%29\"&gt;The Socialist&lt;/a&gt;\", one of the first Marxist periodicals in India. Lotvala also financed the translation and publication of many leftist literature including the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20manifesto\"&gt;Communist manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. The British-Indian ban on Acharya was lifted in 1935 and he returned to Bombay that same year, where he managed a living as a journalist. During this time, Acharya wrote eight articles during this time which would later be collated to be published as a book called \"Reminesces of a Revolutionary\". From Bombay, Acharya established correspondence with Japanese anarchist &lt;a href=\"Taiji%20Yamaga\"&gt;Taiji Yamaga&lt;/a&gt; and Chinese anarchist &lt;a href=\"Lu%20Jinbao\"&gt;Lu Jinbao&lt;/a&gt;. The result of the correspondences led to the three establishing contacts with &lt;a href=\"Commission%20de%20Relations%20de%20l%E2%80%99Internationale%20Anarchiste\"&gt;Commission de Relations de l\u2019Internationale Anarchiste&lt;/a&gt; (Liaison Commission of the Anarchist International). In the following years, Acharya contributed to anarchist publications such as \"&lt;a href=\"Freedom%20%28British%20newspaper%29\"&gt;Freedom&lt;/a&gt;\" in London, \"&lt;a href=\"Tierra%20y%20Libertad%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Tierra y Libertad&lt;/a&gt;\" in Mexico and \"&lt;a href=\"Contre%20Courant\"&gt;Contre Courant&lt;/a&gt;\" in Paris. He also remained in correspondence with &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Meltzer\"&gt;Albert Meltzer&lt;/a&gt; for more than fifteen years.\nIn the following years Acharya was appointed secretary of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Institute%20of%20Sociology\"&gt;Indian Institute of Sociology&lt;/a&gt;, established under Lotvala's patronage in the 1930s. In later years, Acharya's influence on the institute saw it adopts a number of statutes in 1947 and subsequently the institute adopted the name of Libertarian Socialist Institute. His views on economic matters were profound and in 1951, &lt;a href=\"Free%20Society%20Group\"&gt;Free Society Group&lt;/a&gt; of Chicago published his work \"How Long Can Capitalism Survive?\" in 1951.\nDave Andrews.\n&lt;a href=\"Australian\"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Christian%20anarchist\"&gt;Christian anarchist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Andrews%20%28activist%29\"&gt;Dave Andrews&lt;/a&gt; lived in India between 1972 and 1984. In 1975, he and his wife founded and developed a residential community in India called Aashiana (out of which grew Sahara, Sharan and Sahasee \u2013 three well-known Christian community organisations working with slum dwellers, sex workers, drug addicts, and people with HIV/AIDS). When &lt;a href=\"Indira%20Gandhi\"&gt;Indira Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"assassinated\"&gt;assassinated&lt;/a&gt; in 1984, thousands of &lt;a href=\"Sikhs\"&gt;Sikhs&lt;/a&gt; were murdered by violent mobs. Andrews resisted this through non-violent methods of intervention. The Andrews' were forced to flee India soon thereafter."
