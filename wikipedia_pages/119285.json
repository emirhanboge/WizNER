    "text": "Westland is a &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20County%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Wayne County&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. state of &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. It is located about west of downtown &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;. As of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt;, the city had a total population of 84,094. It is the 10th largest city and 12th largest &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20municipalities%20in%20Michigan\"&gt;municipality in Michigan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nDuring the 18th century, the area was inhabited by the people of a &lt;a href=\"Potawatomi\"&gt;Potawatomi&lt;/a&gt; Native American village. Other tribes, particularly three &lt;a href=\"Algonquian%20peoples\"&gt;Algonquian&lt;/a&gt; tribes, used the area as hunting territory. Though white settlers did not begin to settle the area until about 1824, they began passing through at the beginning of the 19th century.\nBefore becoming Westland, the area had several other names. In 1827, the area became known as Bucklin Township, which included what is now the cities of Westland, &lt;a href=\"Livonia%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Livonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garden%20City%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Garden City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Inkster%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Inkster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayne%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Wayne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dearborn%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Dearborn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dearborn%20Heights%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Dearborn Heights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redford%20Township%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Redford Township&lt;/a&gt;. In 1829, it was proposed that Bucklin Township be divided into Lima and Richland; the former is what eventually became Westland. Due to name conflicts under territorial law prohibiting duplication of post office names, Lima was renamed &lt;a href=\"Nankin%20Township%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Nankin Township&lt;/a&gt;, after the Chinese city of &lt;a href=\"Nanjing\"&gt;Nanking&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater history.\nNankin Township was mostly rural until World War II. &lt;a href=\"Norwayne%20Historic%20District\"&gt;Norwayne subdivision&lt;/a&gt; is one of the oldest areas of the city, having existed for over 65 years. The area was built immediately after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; to provide temporary housing for returning soldiers who worked in nearby factories.\nBy 1960, Nankin Township's population had increased to 70,000, giving the area the distinction of being the state's largest township. During the early 1960s, the city of Livonia wanted to annex the part of Nankin in which a large shopping mall, &lt;a href=\"Westland%20Center\"&gt;Westland Shopping Center&lt;/a&gt;, was to be built. The shopping center eventually opened in 1965, joining Northland and Eastland malls in &lt;a href=\"Southfield%2C%20Michigan\"&gt;Southfield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harper%20Woods\"&gt;Harper Woods&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. In reaction to Livonia's annexation attempts, the people of Nankin voted on May 16, 1966, to change the remainder of the township to the City of Westland. At that time, it was the fourth largest city in Wayne County.\nPolitics.\nThe current mayor of Westland is William (Bill) Wild. Mr. Wild took office in January 2007 and continues to serve as mayor.\nThe legislative body of Westland is the City Council, which contains seven members. The current President of the City Council is James Hart. Other Council members are Council President Pro-Tem Michael Londeau, Peter Herzberg, Andrea Rutkowski, Mike McDermott, James Godbout, and Melissa Sampey.\nEducation.\nWestland and the city of Wayne form the &lt;a href=\"Wayne-Westland%20Community%20School%20District\"&gt;Wayne-Westland Community School District&lt;/a&gt;. There are four high schools, &lt;a href=\"John%20Glenn%20High%20School%20%28Westland%2C%20Michigan%29\"&gt;John Glenn&lt;/a&gt;, Tinkham Center, and William D. Ford Career Tech Center in Westland, and &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Memorial%20High%20School\"&gt;Wayne Memorial&lt;/a&gt; in Wayne.

Students in central Westland and portions of northern Westland, as well as isolated areas of neighboring Inkster and Canton, attend John Glenn High School. The northernmost portions of Westland are in the &lt;a href=\"Livonia%20Public%20Schools\"&gt;Livonia Public Schools&lt;/a&gt; district.\nPortions of Westland that had been in the &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20School%20District%20%28Michigan%29\"&gt;Taylor School District&lt;/a&gt; prior to the 2013 dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Inkster%20School%20District\"&gt;Inkster School District&lt;/a&gt; are assigned to Taylor Parks Elementary School, Hoover Middle School, and &lt;a href=\"Harry%20S.%20Truman%20High%20School%20%28Taylor%2C%20Michigan%29\"&gt;Harry S.
