    "text": "Aciagrion approximans, Indian violet dartlet, is a species of &lt;a href=\"damselfly\"&gt;damselfly&lt;/a&gt; in the family &lt;a href=\"Coenagrionidae\"&gt;Coenagrionidae&lt;/a&gt;. It is found in &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20India\"&gt;east&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Ghats\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. The range extends to &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cambodia\"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSubspecies.\n&lt;a href=\"Frederic%20Charles%20Fraser\"&gt;Fraser&lt;/a&gt; considered the specimen found in &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20India\"&gt;northeast&lt;/a&gt; as \"Aciagrion approximans\" and in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Ghats\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt; as \"Aciargion hisopa\" race \"krishna\". A recent study revealed that the subspecies \"krishna\" found in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Ghats\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt; is not conspecific with \"A. hisopa\" and found to be very close to \"A. approximans\" found in &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20India\"&gt;northeast&lt;/a&gt;; but differing at the level of subspecies.\nDescription and habitat.\nIt is a small, slim, slender damselfly with violet and black colors. Its thorax is black with lateral violet stripes. Segments 2 to 7 of the abdomen are black on dorsum and violet in the ventral half. Segments 8 and 9 are violet without any marks. Segment 10 is black on dorsum. The lower half of segment 8 is marked with black in \"A. a. krishna\". Female is similar to the male; but paler in colors. Segments 8 and 9 are black and 10 is blue on dorsum.\nIt breeds in ponds, lakes or in slow moving streams."
