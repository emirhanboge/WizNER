    "text": "Nybro (, ) is a &lt;a href=\"city%20status%20in%20Sweden\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; and the seat of &lt;a href=\"Nybro%20Municipality\"&gt;Nybro Municipality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalmar%20County\"&gt;Kalmar County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; with 13,583\ninhabitants in 2020.\nOverview.\nNybro was founded as a &lt;a href=\"rest%20area\"&gt;rest area&lt;/a&gt; for travellers on the road between &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4xj%C3%B6\"&gt;V\u00e4xj\u00f6&lt;/a&gt; in the west and &lt;a href=\"Kalmar\"&gt;Kalmar&lt;/a&gt; in the east. In the 18th century a new bridge was built where the road crossed a stream and it was hence called \"Nybron\", The New Bridge. A small tavern called \"Lortkrogen\" (literally the Filth Tavern) opened there. The &lt;a href=\"market%20town\"&gt;market town&lt;/a&gt; was founded in the 19th century, but it rapidly transformed into an industrial town. In 1865 the town became a municipality separately from &lt;a href=\"Madesj%C3%B6\"&gt;Madesj\u00f6&lt;/a&gt;. It was granted &lt;a href=\"city%20rights\"&gt;city rights&lt;/a&gt; in 1932.\nNybro is surrounded by forests and small agricultural enclaves. &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A4hrs\"&gt;K\u00e4hrs&lt;/a&gt; is a manufacturer of wooden floors and the largest employer in the city. But the two &lt;a href=\"glassworks\"&gt;glassworks&lt;/a&gt; factories (&lt;a href=\"Nybro%20glasbruk\"&gt;Nybro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pukeberg%20glasbruk\"&gt;Pukeberg&lt;/a&gt;) are more known, because they also serve as tourist attraction. Nybro calls itself \"The city within the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Crystal\"&gt;Kingdom of Crystal&lt;/a&gt;\", the latter being a region with 15 active glassworks including &lt;a href=\"Kosta%20Glasbruk\"&gt;Kosta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boda%20glasbruk\"&gt;Boda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orrefors%20Glasbruk\"&gt;Orrefors&lt;/a&gt;.\nNybro is also the home of &lt;a href=\"Nybro%20Vikings%20IF\"&gt;Nybro Vikings IF&lt;/a&gt;, a professional ice hockey team currently in the third highest league of Sweden, Hockeyettan. The club has however been playing in the second league, Hockeyallsvenskan, for many years as well, and had two years in the highest league back in the 60's. The ice hockey stadium in Nybro is the fourth oldest in the whole of Sweden.\nThe coat of arms was created when city rights were given to Nybro in 1932. The background is golden and the coat of arms depicts a red bridge in the lower part and a pair of black crossbows in the upper. The coat of arms of the neighbouring locality &lt;a href=\"Emmaboda\"&gt;Emmaboda&lt;/a&gt; also depicts crossbows. The symbol can be traced back to coats of arms of the province of Sm\u00e5land and the hundred of S\u00f6dra M\u00f6re but its origin is unknown. The local folk-hero and insurgent &lt;a href=\"Nils%20Dacke\"&gt;Nils Dacke&lt;/a&gt; is however sometimes depicted with the weapon."
