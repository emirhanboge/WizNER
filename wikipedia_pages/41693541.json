    "text": "HDMS \"Niels Juel\" was a &lt;a href=\"training%20ship\"&gt;training ship&lt;/a&gt; built for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Danish%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Danish Navy&lt;/a&gt; between 1914 and 1923. Originally designed before &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"monitor%20%28warship%29\"&gt;monitor&lt;/a&gt;, construction was slowed by the war and she was redesigned as a training &lt;a href=\"cruiser\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt;. Completed in 1923 she made training cruises to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;s, South America and numerous shorter visits to ports in northern Europe. The ship often served as a &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt; and occasionally was used as a &lt;a href=\"royal%20yacht\"&gt;royal yacht&lt;/a&gt; for visits to overseas possessions and other countries.\n\"Niels Juel\" was extensively modernized in the mid-1930s and remained operational after &lt;a href=\"German%20invasion%20of%20Denmark%20%281940%29\"&gt;Nazi Germany occupied Denmark in 1940&lt;/a&gt;. When the Germans attempted to &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Safari\"&gt;seize the Danish Fleet&lt;/a&gt; in August 1943, the ship attempted to escape to Sweden, but was attacked and damaged by German bombers. She was deliberately &lt;a href=\"Ship%20grounding\"&gt;run aground&lt;/a&gt; by her crew to deny the ship to the Germans, but \"Niels Juel\" was not badly damaged. The ship was &lt;a href=\"Marine%20salvage\"&gt;refloated&lt;/a&gt; several months later and repaired by the Germans. They renamed her \"Nordland\" and used her as a training ship. She was &lt;a href=\"scuttled\"&gt;scuttled&lt;/a&gt; by them in May 1945 and her wreck was salvaged in 1952.\nBackground.\n\"Niels Juel\" was originally intended to be an improved version of , a . Like that &lt;a href=\"ship%20class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;, she had a very low &lt;a href=\"freeboard%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;freeboard&lt;/a&gt;, and was intended to be armed with two guns in single &lt;a href=\"gun%20turret\"&gt;gun turret&lt;/a&gt;s fore and aft of the &lt;a href=\"superstructure\"&gt;superstructure&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Battleship%20secondary%20armament\"&gt;secondary armament&lt;/a&gt; of eight guns. The Danes ordered the main guns and their turrets from &lt;a href=\"Krupp\"&gt;Krupp&lt;/a&gt; of Germany in July, a month before the start of World War I, but the order was suspended when the war began. After being &lt;a href=\"laid%20down\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; in September 1914, construction of the ship was severely delayed by shortages of labor and material and she was not &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; until 1918.\nReports from battles between the British and the Germans caused the Danes to change her secondary armament to guns in 1917, but work stopped completely when the war ended on 11 November 1918. Danish politicians believed that the 30.5-centimeter guns could be viewed as provocative by their neighbors and they decided to convert the ship into an innocuous training ship by adding an extra deck to the existing hull and changing the main armament to guns. The new design was approved in 1920 and the ship was completed in 1923.\nDescription.\n\"Niels Juel\" had an &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;overall length&lt;/a&gt; of and was &lt;a href=\"Length%20at%20the%20waterline\"&gt;long at the waterline&lt;/a&gt;. The ship had a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of , and a mean &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . She displaced at &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement\"&gt;standard load&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"deep%20load\"&gt;deep load&lt;/a&gt;. \"Niels Juel\"s crew numbered between 310 and 369 officers and sailors. Her &lt;a href=\"hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; was divided into 10 &lt;a href=\"watertight%20compartment\"&gt;watertight compartment&lt;/a&gt;s and it was fitted with a &lt;a href=\"double%20bottom\"&gt;double bottom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ship had a pair of vertical &lt;a href=\"Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion\"&gt;triple-expansion steam engines&lt;/a&gt;, each driving a single three-bladed &lt;a href=\"propeller\"&gt;propeller&lt;/a&gt;, using steam provided by four &lt;a href=\"Yarrow%20boiler\"&gt;Yarrow boiler&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"superheater\"&gt;superheater&lt;/a&gt;s that operated at a temperature of . The forward pair of boilers were oil fired and the after pair were coal burning. The engines were designed to produce for a speed of . During her &lt;a href=\"sea%20trial\"&gt;sea trial&lt;/a&gt;s, they produced and \"Niels Juel\" reached a maximum speed of . The ship carried of &lt;a href=\"fuel%20oil\"&gt;fuel oil&lt;/a&gt; and of coal which gave a range of at .\nArmament and fire control.\nThe Navy had difficulties procuring the 15-centimeter guns that it wanted for the ship's &lt;a href=\"main%20battery\"&gt;main battery&lt;/a&gt;, rejecting proposals from French, British and Swedish manufacturers as unsatisfactory. Although Krupp was not allowed to deliver finished guns by the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Versailles%20Treaty\"&gt;Versailles Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, it worked out a deal with the Swedish &lt;a href=\"Bofors\"&gt;Bofors&lt;/a&gt; company, which would finish and deliver the guns to the Danes. \"Niels Juel\" mounted ten &lt;a href=\"15%20cm%20SK%20L/45\"&gt;15-centimeter P.K. L/45&lt;/a&gt; guns, a pair side-by-side on the &lt;a href=\"forecastle\"&gt;forecastle&lt;/a&gt; forward of the superstructure, three on each &lt;a href=\"Broadside%20%28naval%29\"&gt;broadside&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"amidships\"&gt;amidships&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"superfiring\"&gt;superfiring&lt;/a&gt; pair aft of the superstructure, all protected by &lt;a href=\"gun%20shield\"&gt;gun shield&lt;/a&gt;s. The mounts had a range of elevation from -10\u00b0 to +30\u00b0 and the guns fired projectiles at a &lt;a href=\"muzzle%20velocity\"&gt;muzzle velocity&lt;/a&gt; of at a rate of five to seven &lt;a href=\"Cartridge%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;rounds&lt;/a&gt; per minute. The guns had a range of .\nA pair of &lt;a href=\"57%20mm%20A.B.K.%20L/30\"&gt;A.B.K. L/30&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"anti-aircraft%20gun\"&gt;anti-aircraft gun&lt;/a&gt;s were mounted on a platform &lt;a href=\"abaft\"&gt;abaft&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"funnel%20%28ship%29\"&gt;funnel&lt;/a&gt;. The mounts had a maximum elevation of 70\u00b0 and the gun had an effective rate of fire of about 16 rounds per minute. Its projectiles were fired at a muzzle velocity of , which gave it a range of . The ship was fitted with a pair of submerged &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s, one on each broadside. The Type H torpedo had a &lt;a href=\"warhead\"&gt;warhead&lt;/a&gt; and a range of at .\nThe ship was provided with a pair of &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Zeiss%20AG\"&gt;Zeiss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Coincidence%20rangefinder%23Stereoscopic%20rangefinders\"&gt;stereoscopic rangefinders&lt;/a&gt;, one on the roof of the &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt; and the other on a platform abaft the &lt;a href=\"mainmast\"&gt;mainmast&lt;/a&gt;. Data from the rangefinders was sent to the transmitting station located on the main deck beneath the conning tower, where it was converted into elevation and &lt;a href=\"Deflection%20%28ballistics%29\"&gt;deflection&lt;/a&gt; data for use by the guns.\nProtection.\n\"Niels Juel\" was protected by &lt;a href=\"Krupp%20cemented%20armor\"&gt;Krupp cemented armor&lt;/a&gt; (KCA) made by &lt;a href=\"Bethlehem%20Steel\"&gt;Bethlehem Steel&lt;/a&gt;. Her &lt;a href=\"Belt%20armor\"&gt;waterline belt&lt;/a&gt; was thick amidships and thinned to towards the ship's ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. The armor plates were high with the lower edge below the &lt;a href=\"waterline\"&gt;waterline&lt;/a&gt;. Two transverse &lt;a href=\"bulkhead%20%28partition%29\"&gt;bulkhead&lt;/a&gt;s (forward) and (aft) closed off the ends of the &lt;a href=\"armored%20citadel\"&gt;armored citadel&lt;/a&gt;. The shields of the 15-centimeter guns had faces and sides. The &lt;a href=\"deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; plates rested on the top edge of the belt armor and were not made from KCA. The conning tower had of armor on the sides with a roof.\nModifications and modernization.\nIn 1929 the three-meter rangefinders were transferred to the &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt;s \"Peder Skram\" and and \"Niels Juel\" received a &lt;a href=\"Barr%20%26amp%3B%20Stroud\"&gt;Barr &amp; Stroud&lt;/a&gt; coincidence rangefinder in return. The following year it was replaced by a Zeiss coincidence rangefinder. When \"Niels Juel\" was modernized in 1935 and 1936, the first priority was to upgrade her &lt;a href=\"fire-control%20system\"&gt;fire-control system&lt;/a&gt;s. Her &lt;a href=\"tripod%20mast\"&gt;tripod mast&lt;/a&gt; was replaced by a pole mast surmounted by a two-story &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23DCT\"&gt;director-control tower&lt;/a&gt; that was fitted with a Dutch Hazemeyer gunnery &lt;a href=\"director%20%28military%29\"&gt;director&lt;/a&gt; that fed information to the analog gunnery computer in the transmitting station below. The Navy purchased three rangefinders from Zeiss to re-equip the ship, replaced the obsolete 57-millimeter AA guns with ten &lt;a href=\"Madsen%2020%20mm%20cannon\"&gt;Madsen RK M/31&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"autocannon\"&gt;autocannon&lt;/a&gt; in five twin-gun mounts, and added tanks for a chemical &lt;a href=\"smoke%20screen\"&gt;smoke screen&lt;/a&gt; at the ship's stern. In April 1937, her anti-aircraft armament was augmented with fourteen &lt;a href=\"Madsen%20machine%20gun\"&gt;Madsen R.K. L/75 M/37&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"machine%20gun\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt;s in twin mounts. In early 1941 a pair of &lt;a href=\"Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun\"&gt;40-millimeter Bofors&lt;/a&gt; light AA guns in single mounts that had been removed from a pair of submarines were added. A year later the existing 8 and 20\u00a0mm weapons were replaced by 10 faster-firing Madsen 20-millimeter L/60 M/41 autocannon in single mounts.\nConstruction and career.\n\"Niels Juel\", named after the &lt;a href=\"Niels%20Juel\"&gt;Danish admiral of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, was laid down on 21 September 1914 at the \"Orlogsv\u00e6rftet\" (Royal Danish Naval Shipyard) in &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;. The ship was launched on 3 July 1918, but she was stuck on the &lt;a href=\"slipway\"&gt;slipway&lt;/a&gt; for over an hour before she could be freed to slide into the water. Construction halted a few months later as her design was reconsidered. Construction began again in 1920 to a new design and she was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; in May 1923 and began a &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W\"&gt;working up&lt;/a&gt; cruise on 28 May, with &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Prince\"&gt;Crown Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20IX%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Frederick&lt;/a&gt; aboard, visiting the &lt;a href=\"Faeroe%20Islands\"&gt;Faeroe Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bergen\"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leith\"&gt;Leith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, before returning home on 6 August.\nOn 21 October \"Niels Juel\" made her first training cruise, visiting &lt;a href=\"Dartmouth%2C%20Devon\"&gt;Dartmouth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cadiz\"&gt;Cadiz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madeira\"&gt;Madeira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Verde%20Islands\"&gt;Cape Verde Islands&lt;/a&gt;, en route to &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;. On her return voyage, she encountered a severe storm after leaving &lt;a href=\"the%20Azores\"&gt;the Azores&lt;/a&gt; that broke her &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; chains and she had to be steered using only her propellers until emergency steering could be rigged. The ship returned home on 23 February 1924, after getting repairs in &lt;a href=\"Plymouth\"&gt;Plymouth&lt;/a&gt;, United Kingdom. \"Niels Juel\" became the &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt; of the gunnery training &lt;a href=\"squadron%20%28naval%29\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; later that year and then later flagship of the general training squadron. In 1925, she made brief visits to &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The following year the ship made a cruise to the Faeroe Islands and &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; with the royal family aboard. \"Niels Juel\" served as the &lt;a href=\"royal%20yacht\"&gt;royal yacht&lt;/a&gt; for a state visit to Finland in 1928, during which she was escorted by the cruiser .\nThe ship made a training cruise to the Mediterranean in 1929, where she visited ports in France, Spain, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Libya\"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;, Portugal. She resumed her position as flagship of the training squadron on her return. Beginning on 22 May 1930, \"Niels Juel\" served as a royal yacht for a royal tour of the Faeroes and Iceland as well as serving as a training ship for naval cadets. The following year, she became the first Danish warship to visit the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; when she visited &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Odessa\"&gt;Odessa&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, and ports in &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, Italy, &lt;a href=\"Algeria\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, and France on her way home. \"Niels Juel\" was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20decommissioning\"&gt;decommissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 3 September 1931 after her return. The ship was modernized in 1935 and 1936 and recommissioned on 9 July and then spent the rest of 1936 working up.\n\"Niels Juel\" was present at the &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20review%20%28Commonwealth%20realms%29\"&gt;Fleet review&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Spithead\"&gt;Spithead&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;George VI of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; on 20 May 1937 and later participated in a fleet exercise that culminated in a visit to &lt;a href=\"Helsingborg\"&gt;Helsingborg&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden. In 1938 she accompanied the &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt; flotilla on a visit to &lt;a href=\"Turku\"&gt;Turku&lt;/a&gt;, Finland in August, and visited &lt;a href=\"S%C3%B8nderborg\"&gt;S\u00f8nderborg&lt;/a&gt;, Denmark, the following month with the rest of the training squadron. A planned training cruise to the United States to visit the &lt;a href=\"1939%20New%20York%20World%27s%20Fair\"&gt;1939 New York World's Fair&lt;/a&gt; in May was cancelled as a result of rising tensions in Europe and \"Niels Juel\" trained with the mobilized \"Peder Skram\" from May to July. In late August the ship was preparing for a visit to &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, Norway, but that was cancelled when she was ordered to fuze all her shells in preparation for war. Her crew was filled out as the Navy mobilized and \"Niels Juel\" joined the rest of the fleet near &lt;a href=\"Aarhus\"&gt;Aarhus&lt;/a&gt;. Winter ice forced the ship to return to Copenhagen in January 1940, even though that port was ice-bound as well. With little possibility of action, her crew was given leave. Her crew was recalled on 8 April, but \"Niels Juel\" was not ready for war when the Germans invaded the following day. The Germans permitted the Danes to keep their ships and allowed them to train in Danish waters.\nOperation Safari.\nFollowing increasing Danish resistance to German rule and the institution of &lt;a href=\"martial%20law\"&gt;martial law&lt;/a&gt; on 28 August 1943, the German army moved to seize the Danish fleet in Copenhagen harbour the following morning, an action codenamed &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Safari\"&gt;Operation Safari&lt;/a&gt;. \"Niels Juel\" was in &lt;a href=\"Holb%C3%A6k\"&gt;Holb\u00e6k&lt;/a&gt; when her &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Commander\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; Carl Westermann, was ordered take his ship to be interned in Sweden. The Germans spotted her after she raised steam and departed. Before the ship could exit the &lt;a href=\"Isefjord\"&gt;Isefjord&lt;/a&gt;, Westermann was informed that the Germans had claimed they had mined the exit, and he spotted three German ships in the distance, the torpedo boat and two &lt;a href=\"E-boat\"&gt;E-boat&lt;/a&gt;s. German aircraft attacked the ship with bombs and by &lt;a href=\"strafing\"&gt;strafing&lt;/a&gt;. None of the bombs hit \"Niels Juel\", but shock damage from near misses knocked out electrical power and deformed some of the hull plating and bulkheads. Realising there was little hope of reaching Sweden, Westermann decided to run the ship aground near &lt;a href=\"Nyk%C3%B8bing%20Sj%C3%A6lland\"&gt;Nyk\u00f8bing Sj\u00e6lland&lt;/a&gt;. The crew then tried to scuttle the ship, but an initial attempt to blow up the ship failed. The crew settled for flooding the &lt;a href=\"Magazine%20%28artillery%29\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt;, opening the &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20valve\"&gt;sea-cocks&lt;/a&gt; to flood the rest of the hull as well as systematically destroying the equipment before the Germans could take over the ship.\n1944 to 1952.\nA Danish salvage company inspected the grounded ship a few days later and did not see any damage to the hull, rudder or propellers, but noted that the ship was flooded with water up to a height of below the armored deck. The Germans used a German company to salvage the ship in October and towed it to &lt;a href=\"Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, for repair. She was disarmed, renamed \"Nordland\", and commissioned into the \"&lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt;\" in September 1944 after which she became a stationary training ship at &lt;a href=\"Stolpm%C3%BCnde\"&gt;Stolpm\u00fcnde&lt;/a&gt; (modern &lt;a href=\"Ustka\"&gt;Ustka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;). On 18 February 1945 the ship steamed to Kiel to avoid the advancing Russian forces. On 3 May, she was scuttled for the second time in the &lt;a href=\"Eckernf%C3%B6rde\"&gt;Eckernf\u00f8rde&lt;/a&gt; inlet. The wreck was partially dismantled by unauthorized salvagers before the Danes sold it to a German firm in 1952 for &lt;a href=\"scrap\"&gt;scrap&lt;/a&gt;. They removed everything above the sea bed, but its remains lie under of water."
