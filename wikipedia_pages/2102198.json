    "text": "Thomas Mervyn Davies (9 December 1946\u00a0\u2013 15 March 2012), often known as \"Merv the Swerve\", was a &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20people\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player who won 38 caps for &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; as a No. 8.\nEarly life.\nDavies was born in &lt;a href=\"Swansea\"&gt;Swansea&lt;/a&gt;, where he attended Penlan County School. His father had played club rugby.\nRugby playing career.\nTall and slight of frame, he grew a Mexican moustache to make himself appear more aggressive on the rugby field. He was nicknamed \"Merv the Swerve\".\nClub rugby.\nDavies joined &lt;a href=\"London%20Welsh%20RFC\"&gt;London Welsh&lt;/a&gt; in 1968, later moving to &lt;a href=\"Swansea%20RFC\"&gt;Swansea&lt;/a&gt;.\nWales and Lions international rugby.\nDavies won his first cap for Wales in 1969 against &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, going on to play 38 consecutive matches for Wales and scoring two tries. During this period Wales won two &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Slam%20%28Rugby%20Union%29\"&gt;Grand Slams&lt;/a&gt; and three &lt;a href=\"Triple%20Crown%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Triple Crown&lt;/a&gt;s. \nHe went on the &lt;a href=\"British%20and%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British and Irish Lions&lt;/a&gt; tours to &lt;a href=\"1971%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in 1971 and to &lt;a href=\"1974%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in 1974, playing in all eight tests. &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Meads\"&gt;Colin Meads&lt;/a&gt; said Davies was \"the one player who probably had the biggest impact on that 1971 Lions Test series,\" particularly as he prevented NZ winning line out ball via &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Lochore\"&gt;Brian Lochore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Willie%20John%20McBride\"&gt;Willie John McBride&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ian%20McLauchlan\"&gt;Ian McLauchlan&lt;/a&gt; both said Davies was even better on the 1974 tour. Many expected Davies to captain the 1977 Lions. \nIn a total of 46 international appearances for Wales and the Lions he only ended on the losing side nine times.\nAppraisal.\nDavies key attributes were lineout play, ball handling skill (including offloading in tight situations), commitment, mental strength, and anticipation.\nIn 2001 Davies was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"International%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;International Rugby Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. In a poll of Welsh rugby fans in 2002, he was voted both Greatest Ever Welsh Captain and Greatest Ever Welsh Number 8. Davies continues to be rated as one of the best No. 8s ever to have played the game.\nRetirement.\nHis career was ended by a &lt;a href=\"subarachnoid%20hemorrhage\"&gt;subarachnoid hemorrhage&lt;/a&gt; suffered when captaining Swansea against &lt;a href=\"Pontypool%20RFC\"&gt;Pontypool&lt;/a&gt; in 1976. He had collapsed during a game on another occasion, four years earlier, and had been wrongly diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"meningitis\"&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;. Following the second incident he was a patient in the &lt;a href=\"University%20Hospital%20of%20Wales\"&gt;University Hospital of Wales&lt;/a&gt; for several months, and received goodwill messages from all over the world.\nHe was a &lt;a href=\"smoking\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt; and was diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"lung%20cancer\"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; (adenocarcinoma) in November 2011. He died 4 months later.\nDavies had a son and daughter by his first wife Shirley; the marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife Jeni and his three stepchildren, and by his two children from his first marriage."
