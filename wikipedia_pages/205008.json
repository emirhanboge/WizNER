    "text": "Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (19 April 1795 \u2013 27 June 1876), &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Natural%20history\"&gt;naturalist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zoologist\"&gt;zoologist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"comparative%20anatomist\"&gt;comparative anatomist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"geologist\"&gt;geologist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"microscopy\"&gt;microscopist&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the most famous and productive &lt;a href=\"scientist\"&gt;scientist&lt;/a&gt;s of his time. Ehrenberg was an &lt;a href=\"Evangelicalism\"&gt;evangelist&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly collections.\nThe son of a judge, Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg was born in &lt;a href=\"Delitzsch\"&gt;Delitzsch&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;. He first studied &lt;a href=\"theology\"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Leipzig\"&gt;University of Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"medicine\"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"natural%20sciences\"&gt;natural sciences&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and became a friend of the famous &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20explorers\"&gt;explorer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20von%20Humboldt\"&gt;Alexander von Humboldt&lt;/a&gt;. In 1818, he completed his doctoral &lt;a href=\"dissertation\"&gt;dissertation&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"fungi\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;, \"Sylvae mycologicae Berolinenses\".\nIn 1820\u20131825, on a scientific expedition to the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; with his friend &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Hemprich\"&gt;Wilhelm Hemprich&lt;/a&gt;, he collected thousands of specimens of &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s. He investigated parts of &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Libyan%20Desert\"&gt;Libyan Desert&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nile\"&gt;Nile valley&lt;/a&gt; and the northern coasts of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sea\"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt;, where he made a special study of the &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt;s. Subsequently, parts of &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arabia\"&gt;Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia\"&gt;Abyssinia&lt;/a&gt; were examined. Some results of these travels and of the important collections that had been made were reported on by Humboldt in 1826. While in Sudan he designed the mansion of the local governor of &lt;a href=\"Dongola\"&gt;Dongola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abidin%20Bey\"&gt;Abidin Bey&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter his return, Ehrenberg published several papers on &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt;s and two volumes \"Symbolae physicae\" (1828\u20131834), in which many particulars of the &lt;a href=\"mammal\"&gt;mammal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s, etc., were made public. Other observations were communicated to scientific societies.\nFocus on microscopic organisms.\nEhrenberg was appointed professor of &lt;a href=\"medicine\"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt; at Berlin University in 1827. In 1829 he accompanied Humboldt through eastern &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; frontier. After his return he began to concentrate his studies on microscopic organisms, which until then had not been systematically studied.\nFor nearly 30 years Ehrenberg examined samples of water, soil, sediment, blowing dust and rock and described thousands of new &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt;, among them well-known &lt;a href=\"flagellate\"&gt;flagellate&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Euglena\"&gt;Euglena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ciliate\"&gt;ciliate&lt;/a&gt;s such as \"&lt;a href=\"Paramecium\"&gt;Paramecium&lt;/a&gt; aurelia\" and \"Paramecium caudatum\", and many &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s, in nearly 400 scientific publications. He was particularly interested in a unicellular group of &lt;a href=\"protist\"&gt;protist&lt;/a&gt;s called &lt;a href=\"diatom\"&gt;diatom&lt;/a&gt;s, but he also studied, and named, many species of &lt;a href=\"radiolaria\"&gt;radiolaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"foraminifera\"&gt;foraminifera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dinoflagellates\"&gt;dinoflagellates&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese researches had an important bearing on some of the infusorial earths used for polishing and other economic purposes; they added, moreover, largely to our knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"microorganism\"&gt;microorganism&lt;/a&gt;s of certain &lt;a href=\"geological%20formation\"&gt;geological formation&lt;/a&gt;s, especially of the &lt;a href=\"chalk\"&gt;chalk&lt;/a&gt;, and of the marine and freshwater accumulations. Until Ehrenberg took up the study it was not known that considerable masses of &lt;a href=\"Rock%20%28geology%29\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; were composed of minute forms of animals or plants. He also demonstrated that the &lt;a href=\"phosphorescence\"&gt;phosphorescence&lt;/a&gt; of the sea was due to organisms.\nHe was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; from 1836 and a foreign member of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society\"&gt;Royal Society&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; from 1837. In 1839, he won the &lt;a href=\"Wollaston%20Medal\"&gt;Wollaston Medal&lt;/a&gt;, the highest award granted by the &lt;a href=\"Geological%20Society%20of%20London\"&gt;Geological Society of London&lt;/a&gt;. Ehrenberg was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in 1849. He continued until late in life to investigate the microscopic organisms of the deep sea and of various geological formations. He died in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; on 27 June 1876.\nLegacy.\nAfter his death in 1876, his collections of &lt;a href=\"microscopic%20organism\"&gt;microscopic organism&lt;/a&gt;s were deposited in the &lt;a href=\"Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20Berlin\"&gt;Berlin's Natural History Museum&lt;/a&gt; (this museum was a part of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;University of Berlin&lt;/a&gt; until it left the university in 2009). The \"Ehrenberg Collection\" includes 40,000 microscope preparations, 5,000 raw samples, 3,000 pencil and ink drawings, and nearly 1,000 letters of correspondence. His collection of &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s, and other arachnids from the Middle East, is also held in the Berlin Museum. Many herbaria around the world also hold botanical collections made by Ehrenberg, including the &lt;a href=\"National%20Herbarium%20of%20Victoria\"&gt;National Herbarium of Victoria&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%2C%20France\"&gt;National Museum of Natural History, France&lt;/a&gt; and the herbarium at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Kew\"&gt;Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was also the first winner of the &lt;a href=\"Leeuwenhoek%20Medal\"&gt;Leeuwenhoek Medal&lt;/a&gt; in 1877.\nIn his hometown, Delitzsch, the highest A-Level school, the \"Ehrenberg-Gymnasium\" is named after him. The best student of the school year receives the Ehrenberg Prize and a scholarship.\n&lt;a href=\"Ehrenberg%20Island\"&gt;Ehrenberg Island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Svalbard\"&gt;Svalbard&lt;/a&gt; archipelago is named after Ehrenberg.\nIn 1998 the Linnean Society of London dedicated a special issue to \"Christian Gottfried Ehrenburg (1795\u20131876) The man and his legacy\".\nFamily.\nChristian Ehrenberg was the son of Johann Gottfried Ehrenberg (1757\u20131826) and his wife Christiane Dorothea Becker (1769\u20131808). His brother Carl August Ehrenberg (1801\u20131849) became a botanist and plant collector.\nAfter attending the same expedition (as part of Humboldt's team) with &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Rose\"&gt;Gustav Rose&lt;/a&gt;, (who was the brother of &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Rose\"&gt;Heinrich Rose&lt;/a&gt;), Ehrenberg married Gustav's cousin Julie Rose (1804\u20131848). After their first son died in infancy they had four daughters: Helene (* 1834), Mathilde (1835\u20131890), Laura (*1836) and &lt;a href=\"Clara%20Ehrenberg\"&gt;Clara Ehrenberg&lt;/a&gt; (1838\u20131916). His youngest daughter Clara Ehrenberg was his assistant for over twelve years. She aided his scientific research, organised and indexed his collections and correspondence, and prepared a taxonomic reference book. Clara was also a published scientific illustrator.\nHelene married the botanist &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20von%20Hanstein\"&gt;Johannes von Hanstein&lt;/a&gt; and Mathilde married the mineraologist &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Friedrich%20August%20Rammelsberg\"&gt;Karl Friedrich August Rammelsberg&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1852 Ehrenberg married his second wife, Karoline Friederike Friccius (1812\u201395), who was related to the chemist &lt;a href=\"Eilhard%20Mitscherlich\"&gt;Eilhard Mitscherlich&lt;/a&gt;. The couple had one son, Hermann Alexander Ehernberg."
