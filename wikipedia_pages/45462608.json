But he decided to remake another film \"&lt;a href=\"Shutter%20%282012%20film%29\"&gt;Shutter&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Prithviraj%20Sukumaran\"&gt;Prithviraj Sukumaran&lt;/a&gt; being cast as the lead, despite reports stating that &lt;a href=\"Anil%20Kapoor\"&gt;Anil Kapoor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abhay%20Deol\"&gt;Abhay Deol&lt;/a&gt; as the leads were surfaced. However, Alphonse eventually shelved the project and decided to work on a fresh script instead. He announced that the film will be titled as \"Premam\", and as the title suggests, the film is said to be a &lt;a href=\"Romance%20film\"&gt;romantic-drama&lt;/a&gt;. The project was bankrolled by director-producer Anwar Rasheed under his banner Anwar Rasheed Entertainment and &lt;a href=\"Nivin%20Pauly\"&gt;Nivin Pauly&lt;/a&gt; was announced playing the lead role, which was his second project with Puthren in the studio album \"&lt;a href=\"Yuvvh\"&gt;Yuvvh&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Neram\".

Alphonse invited applications from Malayalam-speaking women between the ages of 16 and 25. Later they released an ad in September 2014 saying the film needed only two heroines and they must be aged between 15 and 22 and \"both of them should be able to speak Malayalam and English fluently as well as have a very good smile\".

Pallavi, a doctor-cum-dancer, was approached by Alphonse six years before, through clippings from a reality show which she had participated, showcased in &lt;a href=\"Facebook\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Alphonse initially gave her an offer to act in his film which she refused, and after six years, he phoned to Pallavi, in which she thought him as a stalker and wanted to lodge a police complaint on him. But later misunderstood after Alphonse forcibly introduced himself. In an interview, Alphonse revealed that &lt;a href=\"Asin\"&gt;Asin&lt;/a&gt; was initially considered for the character Malar, played by Pallavi, following a fan's request.

And in their competent hands long-standing tales assume ground-breaking forms and enthuse the viewers in ways and manners never seen before. Much more than an unabashed crowd-pleaser, which it surely is, 'Premam' is a bracingly alive film where almost everything, seems to have fallen right into place.\" \"&lt;a href=\"Sify.com\"&gt;Sify.com&lt;/a&gt;\" rated the film 3.5 in a scale of 5 and said, \"Premam is all for some genuine fun and perhaps, a few nostalgic moments as well for 80's and 90's generation.

R. Praveen of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hindu\"&gt;The Hindu&lt;/a&gt;\" said, \"Alphonse Puthren's understanding of the medium is evident and he does not appear to try hard at any point.\" He praised Putharen's script, saying, \"The strong point of Alphonse's script is its humour, which is very organic and does not stick out as a separate track.\" Rejith RG of \"&lt;a href=\"Kerala%20Kaumudi\"&gt;Kerala Kaumudi&lt;/a&gt;\" said, \"Filled with unforgettable moments, characters and song sequences, Premam is a delight to watch. It's after a long time that we got to see such a hugely enjoyable Malayalam film.\" Mythily Ramachandran of \"&lt;a href=\"Gulf%20News\"&gt;Gulf News&lt;/a&gt;\" called it \"A delightful entertainer with Nivin Pauly in the lead\" and said, \"Premam is a fun film, a simple love story of the boy next door, like its tagline that reads 'nothing extraordinary in it'.\" Pramod Thomas of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Indian%20Express\"&gt;The New Indian Express&lt;/a&gt;\" concluded his review saying, \"'Premam' is a watchable flick for its realistic treatment of the plot, performance of the newcomers, wits, good songs and for Nivin Pauly.\"\nBox office.\nThe Movie earned a gross of in Kerala On its first day of release.
