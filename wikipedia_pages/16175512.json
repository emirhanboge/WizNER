    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; is the second-largest state in &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; but has the greatest biodiversity, with 684 species of bird recorded (more than closest-rivals New South Wales or West Australia with both around 550).\nThe high avian biodiversity is probably a reflection of the wide variety of habitats, from desert to rainforest and mangrove forest to &lt;a href=\"The%20bush\"&gt;mulga&lt;/a&gt;, which make Queensland a birders paradise.\nThis list is based on the 1996 classification by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Sibley\"&gt;Sibley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burt%20Monroe\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt; (though there has been a recent (2008) extensive revision of Australian birds by &lt;a href=\"Leslie%20Christidis\"&gt;Christidis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walter%20E.%20Boles\"&gt;Boles&lt;/a&gt;), which has resulted in some &lt;a href=\"lumpers%20and%20splitters\"&gt;lumping and splitting&lt;/a&gt;. Their system has been developed over nearly two decades and has strong local support, but deviates in important ways from more generally accepted schemes. Supplemental updates follow \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Clements%20Checklist%20of%20Birds%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World&lt;/a&gt;\", 2021 edition.\nThis list also uses British English throughout. Any bird names or other wording follows that convention.\nThe following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.\nOstriches.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Struthioniformes\"&gt;Struthioniformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Struthionidae\"&gt;Struthionidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThis order is not native to Australia, but feral populations of one species have become established.\nCassowaries and emu.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Casuariiformes\"&gt;Casuariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Casuariidae\"&gt;Casuariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThis family of flightless ratite birds is represented by two living species in Australia. Another two species are found in New Guinea. The &lt;a href=\"extinction\"&gt;extinct&lt;/a&gt;, geographically-isolated &lt;a href=\"King%20Island%20emu\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kangaroo%20Island%20emu\"&gt;Kangaroo Island emu&lt;/a&gt;s were historically considered to be separate species to mainland emus. However, genetic evidence from 2011 suggests that all three are conspecific.\nMagpie goose.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Anseriformes\"&gt;Anseriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Anseranatidae\"&gt;Anseranatidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family contains a single species, the &lt;a href=\"magpie%20goose\"&gt;magpie goose&lt;/a&gt;. It was an early and distinctive offshoot of the &lt;a href=\"anseriform\"&gt;anseriform&lt;/a&gt; family tree, diverging after the &lt;a href=\"screamer\"&gt;screamer&lt;/a&gt;s and before all other ducks, geese and swans, sometime in the &lt;a href=\"late%20Cretaceous\"&gt;late Cretaceous&lt;/a&gt;. The single species is found across Australia.\nDucks, geese, and waterfowl.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Anseriformes\"&gt;Anseriformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Anatidae\"&gt;Anatidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Anatidae includes the &lt;a href=\"duck\"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt;s and most duck-like waterfowl, such as &lt;a href=\"goose\"&gt;geese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"swan\"&gt;swan&lt;/a&gt;s. These are adapted for an aquatic existence, with webbed feet, bills that are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils.\nMegapodes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Galliformes\"&gt;Galliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Megapodiidae\"&gt;Megapodiidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Megapodiidae\"&gt;Megapodiidae&lt;/a&gt; are represented by various species in the Australasian region. They are commonly referred to as \"mound-builders\" due to their habit of constructing large mounds to incubate their eggs.\nGuineafowl.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Galliformes\"&gt;Galliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Numididae\"&gt;Numididae&lt;/a&gt;\nNumididae are not native to Australia, but feral populations of one species exist in Queensland.\nPheasants, grouse, and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Galliformes\"&gt;Galliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Phasianidae\"&gt;Phasianidae&lt;/a&gt;\nPhasianidae consists of the pheasants and their allies. These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump, with broad, relatively short wings. Many species are gamebirds or have been domesticated as a food source for humans.\nGrebes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Podicipediformes\"&gt;Podicipediformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Podicipedidae\"&gt;Podicipedidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grebe\"&gt;Grebe&lt;/a&gt;s are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.\nPigeons and doves.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Columbiformes\"&gt;Columbiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Columbidae\"&gt;Columbidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pigeon\"&gt;Pigeon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dove\"&gt;dove&lt;/a&gt;s are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy &lt;a href=\"cere\"&gt;cere&lt;/a&gt;.\nBustards.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Otidiformes\"&gt;Otidiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Otididae\"&gt;Otididae&lt;/a&gt;\nBustards are large terrestrial birds mainly associated with dry open country and steppes in the Old World. They are omnivorous and nest on the ground. They walk steadily on strong legs and big toes, pecking for food as they go. They have long broad wings with \"fingered\" wingtips and striking patterns in flight. Many have interesting mating displays.\nCuckoos.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Cuculiformes\"&gt;Cuculiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Cuculidae\"&gt;Cuculidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Cuculidae includes &lt;a href=\"cuckoo\"&gt;cuckoo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Geococcyx\"&gt;roadrunner&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ani%20%28bird%29\"&gt;anis&lt;/a&gt;. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails and strong legs. The Old World cuckoos are &lt;a href=\"brood%20parasite\"&gt;brood parasite&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFrogmouths.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgiformes\"&gt;Caprimulgiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Frogmouth\"&gt;Podargidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe frogmouths are a distinctive group of small nocturnal birds related to swifts found from India across southern Asia to Australia.\nNightjars and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgiformes\"&gt;Caprimulgiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgidae\"&gt;Caprimulgidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Nightjar\"&gt;Nightjar&lt;/a&gt;s are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves.\nOwlet-nightjars.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgiformes\"&gt;Caprimulgiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Owlet-nightjar\"&gt;Aegothelidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe owlet-nightjars are a distinctive group of small nocturnal birds related to swifts found from the &lt;a href=\"Maluku%20Islands\"&gt;Maluku Islands&lt;/a&gt; and New Guinea to Australia and New Caledonia.\nSwifts.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Caprimulgiformes\"&gt;Caprimulgiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Apodidae\"&gt;Apodidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Swift%20%28bird%29\"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt;s are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.\nRails, gallinules, and coots.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Rallidae\"&gt;Rallidae&lt;/a&gt;\nRallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the &lt;a href=\"Rail%20%28bird%29\"&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crake\"&gt;crake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coot\"&gt;coot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Gallinula\"&gt;gallinule&lt;/a&gt;s. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.\nCranes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Gruiformes\"&gt;Gruiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Gruidae\"&gt;Gruidae&lt;/a&gt;\nCranes are large, long-legged and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or \"dances\".\nThick-knees.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Burhinidae\"&gt;Burhinidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe thick-knees are a group of largely tropical waders in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.\nStilts and avocets.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Recurvirostridae\"&gt;Recurvirostridae&lt;/a&gt;\nRecurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds, which includes the &lt;a href=\"avocet\"&gt;avocet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stilt\"&gt;stilt&lt;/a&gt;s. The avocets have long legs and long up-curved bills. The stilts have extremely long legs and long, thin straight bills.\nOystercatchers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Haematopodidae\"&gt;Haematopodidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"oystercatcher\"&gt;oystercatcher&lt;/a&gt;s are large and noisy &lt;a href=\"plover\"&gt;plover&lt;/a&gt;-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prising open &lt;a href=\"mollusc\"&gt;mollusc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPlovers and lapwings.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Charadriidae\"&gt;Charadriidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Charadriidae includes the &lt;a href=\"plover\"&gt;plover&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dotterel\"&gt;dotterel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"lapwing\"&gt;lapwing&lt;/a&gt;s. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.\nPlains-wanderer.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Pedionomidae\"&gt;Pedionomidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe plains-wanderer is a &lt;a href=\"quail\"&gt;quail&lt;/a&gt;-like ground bird. They are excellent camouflagers, and will first hide at any disturbance. If they're approached too close, they will run as opposed to flying, which they are very poor at.\nPainted-snipes.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Rostratulidae\"&gt;Rostratulidae&lt;/a&gt;\nPainted-snipes are short-legged, long-billed birds similar in shape to the true snipes, but more brightly coloured.\nJacanas.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Jacanidae\"&gt;Jacanidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jacana%20%28genus%29\"&gt;jacana&lt;/a&gt;s are a group of waders found throughout the tropics. They are identifiable by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat.\nSandpipers and allies.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Scolopacidae\"&gt;Scolopacidae&lt;/a&gt;\nScolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the &lt;a href=\"sandpiper\"&gt;sandpiper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"curlew\"&gt;curlew&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"godwit\"&gt;godwit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tringa\"&gt;shanks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tattler%20%28bird%29\"&gt;tattler&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"woodcock\"&gt;woodcock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snipe\"&gt;snipe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dowitcher\"&gt;dowitcher&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"phalarope\"&gt;phalarope&lt;/a&gt;s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.\nButtonquail.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Turnicidae\"&gt;Turnicidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe buttonquails are small, drab, running birds which resemble the true quails. The female is the brighter of the sexes and initiates courtship. The male incubates the eggs and tends the young.\nPratincoles and coursers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Glareolidae\"&gt;Glareolidae&lt;/a&gt;\nGlareolidae is a family of wading birds comprising the &lt;a href=\"pratincole\"&gt;pratincole&lt;/a&gt;s, which have short legs, long pointed wings, and long forked tails, and the &lt;a href=\"courser\"&gt;courser&lt;/a&gt;s, which have long legs, short wings, and long, pointed bills which curve downwards.\nSkuas and jaegers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Stercorariidae\"&gt;Stercorariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe family Stercorariidae are, in general, medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They nest on the ground in temperate and arctic regions and are long-distance migrants.\nGulls, terns, and skimmers.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Charadriiformes\"&gt;Charadriiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Laridae\"&gt;Laridae&lt;/a&gt;\nLaridae is a family of medium to large seabirds, the &lt;a href=\"gull\"&gt;gull&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tern\"&gt;tern&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Skimmer%20%28bird%29\"&gt;skimmer&lt;/a&gt;s. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish.\nTropicbirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Phaethontiformes\"&gt;Phaethontiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"tropicbird\"&gt;Phaethontidae&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tropicbird\"&gt;Tropicbird&lt;/a&gt;s are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their long wings have black markings, as does the head.\nPenguins.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Penguin\"&gt;Sphenisciformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Penguin\"&gt;Spheniscidae&lt;/a&gt;\nPenguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in Antarctica. Only one species, the &lt;a href=\"little%20penguin\"&gt;little penguin&lt;/a&gt;, breeds on the Australian coast.\nAlbatrosses.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Albatross\"&gt;Diomedeidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe albatrosses are a family of large seabird found across the Southern and North Pacific Oceans.

Their flight is fluttering and sometimes &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;-like.\nNorthern storm-petrels.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Hydrobatidae\"&gt;Hydrobatidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThough the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family.\nShearwaters and petrels.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Procellariiformes\"&gt;Procellariiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Procellariidae\"&gt;Procellariidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \"true petrels\", characterised by united nostrils with medium &lt;a href=\"nasal%20septum\"&gt;nasal septum&lt;/a&gt;, and a long outer functional &lt;a href=\"Primary%20feathers\"&gt;primary&lt;/a&gt; flight feather.\nStorks.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Ciconiiformes\"&gt;Ciconiiformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Ciconiidae\"&gt;Ciconiidae&lt;/a&gt;\nStorks are large, long-legged, long-necked, wading birds with long, stout bills. Storks are mute, but bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years.\nFrigatebirds.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Fregatidae\"&gt;Fregatidae&lt;/a&gt;\nFrigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black, or black-and-white, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.\nBoobies and gannets.\nOrder: &lt;a href=\"Suliformes\"&gt;Suliformes&lt;/a&gt;Family: &lt;a href=\"Sulidae\"&gt;Sulidae&lt;/a&gt;\nThe sulids comprise the &lt;a href=\"gannet\"&gt;gannet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"booby\"&gt;boobies&lt;/a&gt;.
