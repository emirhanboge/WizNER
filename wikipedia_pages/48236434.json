    "text": "Jaclyn \"Jackie\" Barnes (born November 29, 1986) is an American &lt;a href=\"goalball\"&gt;goalball&lt;/a&gt; player. Although originally disinterested in the sport, fearing it was a \"special\" sport and new to losing her vision, she later embraced it. She was on the gold medal winning US team in &lt;a href=\"Goalball%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;Goalball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics&lt;/a&gt;."
