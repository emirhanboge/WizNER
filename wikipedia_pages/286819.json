    "text": "New class is used as a &lt;a href=\"polemic\"&gt;polemic&lt;/a&gt; term by &lt;a href=\"critics\"&gt;critics&lt;/a&gt; of countries that followed the Soviet-type Communism to describe the privileged &lt;a href=\"ruling%20class\"&gt;ruling class&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"bureaucrat\"&gt;bureaucrat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Communist%20party\"&gt;Communist party&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"functionaries\"&gt;functionaries&lt;/a&gt; which arose in these states. Generally, the group known in the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"nomenklatura\"&gt;nomenklatura&lt;/a&gt; conforms to the theory of the new class. The term was earlier applied to other emerging strata of the society. &lt;a href=\"Milovan%20%C4%90ilas\"&gt;Milovan \u0110ilas&lt;/a&gt;' new-class theory was also used extensively by &lt;a href=\"anti-communist\"&gt;anti-communist&lt;/a&gt; commentators in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;Western world&lt;/a&gt; in their criticism of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20states\"&gt;Communist states&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Red%20flag%20%28politics%29\"&gt;Red&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bourgeoisie\"&gt;bourgeoisie&lt;/a&gt;\" is a &lt;a href=\"pejorative\"&gt;pejorative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"synonym\"&gt;synonym&lt;/a&gt; for the term new class, crafted by leftist critics and movements like the &lt;a href=\"1968%20student%20demonstrations%20in%20Belgrade\"&gt;1968 student demonstrations in Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;. New class is also used as a term in late 1960s &lt;a href=\"post-industrial%20society\"&gt;post-industrial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sociology\"&gt;sociology&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilovan \u0110ilas' analysis.\nA theory of the new class was developed by &lt;a href=\"Milovan%20%C4%90ilas\"&gt;Milovan \u0110ilas&lt;/a&gt; the Vice President of the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Josip%20Broz%20Tito\"&gt;Josip Broz Tito&lt;/a&gt;, who participated with Tito in the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20People%27s%20Liberation%20War\"&gt;Yugoslav People's Liberation War&lt;/a&gt; but was later &lt;a href=\"purge\"&gt;purge&lt;/a&gt;d by him as \u0110ilas began to advocate &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"egalitarianism\"&gt;egalitarian&lt;/a&gt; ideals, which he believed were more in line with the way &lt;a href=\"socialism\"&gt;socialism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communism&lt;/a&gt; should look like. There were also personal antagonisms between the two men, and Tito felt \u0110ilas undermined his leadership. The theory of the new class can be considered to oppose the theories of certain ruling Communists, such as &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt;, who argued that their revolutions and/or social reforms would result in the extinction of any ruling class as such. It was \u0110ilas' observation as a member of a Communist government that Party members stepped into the role of ruling class, a problem which he believed should be corrected through revolution. \u0110ilas' completed his primary work on his new class theory in the mid-1950s. While \u0110ilas was in prison, it was published in 1957 in the West under the title \"\".\n\u0110ilas posited that the new class' specific relationship to the &lt;a href=\"means%20of%20production\"&gt;means of production&lt;/a&gt; was one of collective political control, and that the new class' property form was political control. For \u0110ilas, the new class not only seeks expanded material reproduction to politically justify its existence to the &lt;a href=\"working%20class\"&gt;working class&lt;/a&gt; but also seeks expanded reproduction of political control as a form of property in itself. This can be compared to the capitalist who seeks expanded value through increased sharemarket values, even though the sharemarket itself does not necessarily reflect an increase in the value of commodities produced. \u0110ilas used this argument about property forms to indicate why the new class sought parades, marches and spectacles despite this activity lowering the levels of material productivity. \u0110ilas proposed that the new class only slowly came to self-consciousness of itself as a class. On arriving at a full self-consciousness the initial project undertaken would be massive &lt;a href=\"industrialisation\"&gt;industrialisation&lt;/a&gt; in order to cement the external security of the new class' rule against foreign or alternative ruling classes. In \u0110ilas' schema, this approximated the 1930s and 1940s in the Soviet Union. As the new class suborns all other interests to its own security during this period, it freely executes and purges its own members in order to achieve its major goal of security as a ruling class. After security has been achieved, the new class pursues a policy of moderation towards its own members, effectively granting material rewards and freedom of thought and action within the new class, so long as this freedom is not used to undermine the rule of the new class. \u0110ilas identified this period as the period of &lt;a href=\"Nikita%20Khrushchev\"&gt;Khrushchev&lt;/a&gt;'s government in the Soviet Union. Due to the emergence of conflicts of policy within the new class, the potential for palace coups, or populist revolutions is possible, as experienced in Poland and Hungary, respectively. Finally, \u0110ilas predicted a period of economic decline, as the political future of the new class was consolidated around a staid programme of corruption and self-interest at the expense of other social classes. This can be interpreted as a prediction of the &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Brezhnev\"&gt;Leonid Brezhnev&lt;/a&gt; so-called &lt;a href=\"Era%20of%20Stagnation\"&gt;Era of Stagnation&lt;/a&gt; by \u0110ilas.\nWhile \u0110ilas posited that the new class was a social class with a distinct relationship to the &lt;a href=\"means%20of%20production\"&gt;means of production&lt;/a&gt;, he did not claim that this new class was associated with a self-sustaining &lt;a href=\"mode%20of%20production\"&gt;mode of production&lt;/a&gt;. This claim, within &lt;a href=\"Marxist\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; theory, argues that the Soviet-style societies must eventually either collapse backwards towards capitalism, or experience a social revolution towards real &lt;a href=\"socialism\"&gt;socialism&lt;/a&gt;. This can be seen as a prediction of the downfall of the Soviet Union. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20D.%20Kaplan\"&gt;Robert D. Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;'s 1993 book \"Balkan Ghosts: A Journey through history\" also contains a discussion with \u0110ilas, who used his model to anticipate many of the events that subsequently came to pass in the former Yugoslavia. Marxists like &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Mandel\"&gt;Ernest Mandel&lt;/a&gt; have criticised Djilas for ignoring the existence of a new socio-economic system, which cannot be reconciled with the old class system.\nSimilarity to other analyses.\nWhile the specific notions of \u0110ilas are his own development, the idea that bureaucrats in a typical Marxist\u2013Leninist style state become a new class is not his original idea. &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Bakunin\"&gt;Mikhail Bakunin&lt;/a&gt; had made this point in his &lt;a href=\"International%20Workingmen%27s%20Association\"&gt;International Workingmen's Association&lt;/a&gt; debates with Marx in the mid-to-late 19th century. This idea was repeated after the Russian revolution by anarchists like &lt;a href=\"Kropotkin\"&gt;Kropotkin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Makhno\"&gt;Makhno&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some Marxists. In 1911, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Michels\"&gt;Robert Michels&lt;/a&gt; first proposed the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20law%20of%20oligarchy\"&gt;Iron law of oligarchy&lt;/a&gt;, which described the development of bureaucratic hierarchies in supposedly egalitarian and democratic &lt;a href=\"socialist\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; parties. It was later repeated by a leader of the Russian Revolution, &lt;a href=\"Leon%20Trotsky\"&gt;Leon Trotsky&lt;/a&gt; through his theory of &lt;a href=\"degenerated%20workers%20state\"&gt;degenerated workers state&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mao%20Zedong\"&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/a&gt; also had his own version of this idea developed during the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Education%20Movement\"&gt;Socialist Education Movement&lt;/a&gt; to criticize the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20China\"&gt;Communist Party of China&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Shaoqi\"&gt;Liu Shaoqi&lt;/a&gt;. This wide range of people over the decades had different perspectives on the matter, but there was also a degree of core agreement on this idea.\nThe work of &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Hayek\"&gt;Friedrich Hayek&lt;/a&gt; also anticipated much of \u0110ilas' new class criticism without placing them in a Marxist context, such as in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Road%20to%20Serfdom\"&gt;The Road to Serfdom&lt;/a&gt;\". American &lt;a href=\"neoconservatives\"&gt;neoconservatives&lt;/a&gt; adapted New Class analysis in their theory of the &lt;a href=\"managerial%20state\"&gt;managerial state&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Popper\"&gt;Karl Popper&lt;/a&gt;'s criticisms of utopian social pursuits in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Open%20Society%20and%20Its%20Enemies\"&gt;The Open Society and Its Enemies&lt;/a&gt;\", especially in note 6 to Chapter 18 and related text, are markedly similar to \u0110ilas' views, which were nonetheless developed independently.\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith and post-industrial sociology.\nCanadian-American economist &lt;a href=\"John%20Kenneth%20Galbraith\"&gt;John Kenneth Galbraith&lt;/a&gt; also wrote about a similar phenomenon under capitalism, the emergence of a technocratic layer in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Industrial%20State\"&gt;The New Industrial State&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Affluent%20Society\"&gt;The Affluent Society&lt;/a&gt;\". The new-class model as a theory of new social groups in post-industrial societies gained ascendency during the 1970s as social and political scientists noted how new-class groups were shaped by post-material orientations in their pursuit of political and social goals. New-class themes \"no longer have a direct relationship to the imperatives of economic security.\""
