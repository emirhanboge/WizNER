In a December 2015 interview in anticipation of the tour, he said that \"I\u2019m doing it to challenge myself, I won\u2019t know what songs I\u2019m going to do when I go on stage. I won\u2019t have to, because I won\u2019t have a band\". It was ultimately Prince's final tour due to his sudden death from a &lt;a href=\"fentanyl\"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/a&gt; overdose on April 21, 2016, one week after the last tour date.\nSet list.\nA set from Melbourne in follows:\nEarly Show\nEncore\nLate Show\nEncore\nShows.\nPrince was also scheduled to perform in the UK, including the &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20Royal%20Drury%20Lane\"&gt;Theatre Royal Drury Lane&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, however these were cancelled due to ticket touts and the Paris attacks."
