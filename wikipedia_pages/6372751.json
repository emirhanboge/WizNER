    "text": "The University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band (UMMB) is the &lt;a href=\"marching%20band\"&gt;marching band&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Amherst\"&gt;University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;/a&gt; known for its drum corps style and nationally renowned percussion section. The Minuteman Band is also known for its use of dance routines, vocalists, electronics, and overall showmanship.\nThe Minuteman Band plays halftime and post-game shows at all home &lt;a href=\"UMass%20Minutemen%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; games and a variety of away games, parades, and exhibitions each season. The band has performed internationally in Canada and Ireland, at Ronald Reagan's and George W. Bush's inaugurations, the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade, and the Rose Parade. The Minuteman Band has also given five exhibition performances at the annual &lt;a href=\"Bands%20of%20America\"&gt;Bands of America&lt;/a&gt; Grand National Championships and performed at 15 pro football games. The band has performed at the annual Collegiate Marching Band Festival in Allentown, PA since the festival's inception in 1995 to 2019.\nThe UMass Band ethos was captured in the 1994 documentary \"Building Power and Class\", broadcast on PBS affiliates in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. In 1998, the Minuteman Marching Band was awarded the prestigious &lt;a href=\"Sudler%20Trophy\"&gt;Sudler Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, the highest honor that can be bestowed upon a collegiate marching band. In 2003, band alumna and former drum major Kerstin Becker published \"Through These Doors,\" a coffee-table size book chronicling the history of the Minuteman Band.\nThe band was directed by &lt;a href=\"George%20N.%20Parks\"&gt;George N. Parks&lt;/a&gt; from 1977 until his sudden death in September 2010; prompting Assistant Director &lt;a href=\"Thom%20Hannum\"&gt;Thom Hannum&lt;/a&gt; to be named interim director, assisted by Michael Klesch. &lt;a href=\"Timothy%20Todd%20Anderson\"&gt;Timothy Todd Anderson&lt;/a&gt; was named director of the band in 2011.\nIn 2011, the &lt;a href=\"George%20N.%20Parks%20Minuteman%20Marching%20Band%20Building\"&gt;George N. Parks Minuteman Marching Band Building&lt;/a&gt; was completed, giving the band its first home since the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Chapel%20%28Amherst%2C%20Massachusetts%29\"&gt;Old Chapel&lt;/a&gt; was closed in 1997.\nHistory.\nThe band program at &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Amherst\"&gt;University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;/a&gt; started in 1873 when the University was known as the Massachusetts Agricultural College. The Morris Drum Corps, as it was known, was the first resemblance of a marching band at the school, and it was directed by First Lieutenant Charles Morris of the 5th Army Artillery.\nIn the 1890s, the band was renamed the Clark Memorial Cadet Band after former college president William S. Clark. At the close of the century the band's instrumentation expanded, but the musicians consisted only of military cadets.\nIn 1931, the Massachusetts Agricultural College, or \"Aggie\", became the Massachusetts State College. Soon after, in 1934, the College hired its first music instructor, Frank Stratton. A year later, Massachusetts Agricultural College started to organize a formal band program, and appointed its first non-military band instructor, Charles Farnum. The newly created band became known as the \"Redmen Marching Band\". In 1938, the band had its most successful season to date by playing at all home games and an away game versus the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard%20Academy\"&gt;United States Coast Guard Academy&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, all bands at the University were disbanded from March 1943 until September 1945 because many of the members served in the military.\nAfter the war, the band remained small, so the director set out to create a female \"drill team\" to augment the band. In 1946, this team expanded to a size of 44. This drill team was given the name of the \"Precisionettes\" in 1952.\nIn 1947 the Massachusetts State College became the University of Massachusetts. The band's name changed from the Redmen Marching Band to the Minuteman Marching Band in the 1970s under the leadership of Professor John Jenkins. Jenkins brought a new style of marching, high step rapid rhythm (thighs parallel to the ground) to UMass from the University of Michigan, and composer &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Bilik\"&gt;Jerry Bilik&lt;/a&gt;, who notably wrote the \"Fight Mass\" fight song. In 1977, &lt;a href=\"George%20N.%20Parks\"&gt;George N. Parks&lt;/a&gt; was hired to direct the band. Parks brought the &lt;a href=\"roll-step\"&gt;roll-step&lt;/a&gt; marching style and fostered the reputation that the band has today. His unique styles and intensity were widely praised.\nUntil 1997, the band was housed in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Chapel%20%28Amherst%2C%20Massachusetts%29\"&gt;Old Chapel&lt;/a&gt; on campus. From then, and until the October 17, 2009 groundbreaking of a marching band specific building, the band utilized a variety of campus locations for space. The University named the building in honor of George Parks.\nIn 2010, George Parks suffered a heart attack while traveling with the band to the University of Michigan. Associate director Thom Hannum was named interim director. In 2011, Timothy Todd Anderson was named permanent Director and Professor Hannum resumed his role as Associate Director. Christine McHugh Sirard was named Assistant Director in 2015, and serves as director of the color guard.\nIn May 2021, it was announced that UMass alumnus Ian Hale will be replacing Thom Hannum as Associate Director and head of percussion beginning August 2, 2021.\nMinuteman Band Hall of Fame.\nMany former band members and other figures have been elected to the Minuteman Band Hall of Fame by its alumni association since 1993. Induction years listed in parentheses.\nLeadership and Sections.\nStudent Staff.\nStudent leadership has a major role in the UMMB. The UMMB is composed of student run administrative staff as well as field staff. Students in these roles are responsible for many aspects of the band on and off the field.\nDrum Majors.\nAs of 2021 the current &lt;a href=\"Drum%20major%20%28marching%20band%29\"&gt;Drum majors&lt;/a&gt; are Zoe Stinson, Jack Bainton, Zo\u00eb Cohen, Daniel Cuoco, and Lauren Foley. \nExecutive Staff / Ad Staff.\nStudents can take on leadership roles within the band such as band manager, travel manager, and personnel manager. There is also administrative staff roles which include web staff, AV staff, merchandise staff, uniform staff, PR staff, historian staff, equipment staff, and librarian staff.\nInstrumentation.\nThe Minuteman Band comprises typical marching band instruments: &lt;a href=\"mellophone\"&gt;mellophone&lt;/a&gt;s instead of &lt;a href=\"French%20horn\"&gt;French horn&lt;/a&gt;s, alto and tenor &lt;a href=\"saxophone\"&gt;saxophone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"flute\"&gt;flute&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piccolo\"&gt;piccolo&lt;/a&gt;s (audition only), &lt;a href=\"clarinet\"&gt;clarinet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trumpet\"&gt;trumpet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trombone\"&gt;trombone&lt;/a&gt;s, marching &lt;a href=\"baritone%20horn\"&gt;baritone horn&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"sousaphone\"&gt;sousaphone&lt;/a&gt;s instead of &lt;a href=\"tuba\"&gt;tuba&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn addition to the instrumentation on the field, the band has &lt;a href=\"Keyboard%20instrument\"&gt;keyboards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"marimba\"&gt;marimba&lt;/a&gt;, electric &lt;a href=\"guitar\"&gt;guitar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bass%20guitar\"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt; as well as various singers. The wind and guard sections of the band do not require auditions for their members, however some instruments like the piccolo, guitar, bass, and vocals require an audition which is open to any band member. The twirlers, drum line and front ensemble are auditioned.\nStyle.\nThe Minuteman Band's style is that of a drum corps, forming precise drill sets and shapes. However, The UMMB is known for its \"dance-like moves\" and tends to mix them in with the more traditional marching styles. The main show theme usually includes traditional marching band styles with some songs that are looser and less rigid. The band's use of amplification with &lt;a href=\"electric%20guitar\"&gt;electric guitar&lt;/a&gt;s and other percussion often gives the band the reputation as a non-traditional marching band.\nColorguard and Twirlers.\nThe UMass Colorguard and Twirlers are the visual sections in the University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band, the Power and Class of New England. The Colorguard is led by Chris McHugh Sirard and is a fully modernized ensemble utilizing flag, rifle, sabre, dance, and alternative equipment.\nThe UMass colorguard began in 1974 and has been performing along side the UMMB ever since. The UMMB and Colorguard perform at halftime and during post-game at all home football games and frequently travels to away games. The band has also performed at Bands of America in 1993, 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2011. As of the 2019 season, there were over 40 members in the UMass colorguard.\nThe twirlers are led by Kristi Ochs, they incorporate baton, dance, and ribbon into their routines.\nPercussion.\nThe Minuteman Marching Band's percussion section is widely considered to be one of the best in the nation as it is one of the sections that is audition based. The UMass Drumline has helped to build a national reputation for their dedication, skill, and hard work that is paralleled by few others in the nation. The percussion section was most notably instructed by DCI hall-of-famer &lt;a href=\"Thom%20Hannum\"&gt;Thom Hannum&lt;/a&gt; until 2021 when Ian Hale was named the new head of percussion. Hannum is best known for his work in &lt;a href=\"Drum%20Corps%20International\"&gt;Drum Corps International&lt;/a&gt;, as well as being a clinician and author of percussive technique books.\nThe UMass Drumline is also known for many of its alumni who have branched out into many teaching and writing opportunities in percussive arts throughout the nation. This includes Hale who has worked with Madison Scouts, Carolina Crown, Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps, and Boston Crusaders Drum and Bugle Corps prior to his role as head of percussion and associate director. \nRecent Seasons.\n2003-2007.\nThe 2003 Season show consisted of a mix of songs with no clearly set theme. It has sometimes been called \"Hot Jazz\". Among the songs were \"&lt;a href=\"Birdland%20%28composition%29\"&gt;Birdland&lt;/a&gt;\", \"El Boro\", \"Legend of the One Eyed Sailor\", \"Get it On\", and &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Estefan\"&gt;Gloria Estefan&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Oye Tu Conga\". The pit was featured on a version of Radiohead's \"Paranoid Android\". The band went to &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Delaware\"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, Allentown, MICCA Regionals in Bridgeport, CT., and to a post-season game at Colgate.\nThe 2004 Season show consisted of music from the musical \"&lt;a href=\"West%20Side%20Story%20%28musical%29\"&gt;West Side Story&lt;/a&gt;\" and songs written by &lt;a href=\"Elton%20John\"&gt;Elton John&lt;/a&gt;. Notable performances included the &lt;a href=\"Bands%20of%20America\"&gt;Bands of America&lt;/a&gt; Grand Nationals at the &lt;a href=\"RCA%20Dome\"&gt;RCA Dome&lt;/a&gt; in Indianapolis, Indiana where they also performed the song \"God Bless the USA\" as backing band for Lee Greenwood. A smaller group of the band also performed at the Boston Public Library for a private event celebrating William Bulger's 70th birthday.\nThe 2005 season consisted of music from the movie \"&lt;a href=\"Troy%20%28film%29\"&gt;Troy&lt;/a&gt;\" and the band &lt;a href=\"Earth%2C%20Wind%2C%20and%20Fire\"&gt;Earth, Wind, and Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Among the notable performances during this season, the band played at the football game between UMass and the United States Army at &lt;a href=\"West%20Point\"&gt;West Point&lt;/a&gt;. During this performance, the band played &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Greenwood\"&gt;Lee Greenwood&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"God%20Bless%20the%20USA\"&gt;God Bless the USA&lt;/a&gt;\" in honor of the armed forces.

The group choose to use the Marching Band in the video because several members of the Sixers are Alumni of the university and the marching band.\nThe fall 2010 show featured music from the motion picture \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wind%20and%20the%20Lion\"&gt;The Wind and the Lion&lt;/a&gt;\" as well as a medley of &lt;a href=\"Madonna%20%28entertainer%29\"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt; songs.

The fall 2010 season included performances in Allentown and a game at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Michigan\"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn September 16, 2010, while in &lt;a href=\"Cuyahoga%20Falls%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20N.%20Parks\"&gt;George N. Parks&lt;/a&gt; suffered a fatal &lt;a href=\"heart%20attack\"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; after the band's performance for the local high school and opposing team's band. The band played for the high schoolers as a \"thank you\" for being allowed to use their facilities during a stopover on the Michigan trip. The band decided to go ahead to Michigan, and performed to great success in front of 110,187 people, the largest audience in the band's history. When the band returned to Cuyahoga Falls on their way home, the town provided a banquet when the band arrived, and a police escort when they departed the next day.\nTwo weeks after Michigan, the band performed in Allentown. The following week, for Homecoming, the school held a two-hour tribute in the &lt;a href=\"Mullins%20Center\"&gt;Mullins Center&lt;/a&gt; for Parks before that day's football game. For halftime, an alumni band composed of almost 1,000 past members performed first a tune, and then a combined performance with current members of the band.

UMass moved classes online and the UMMB was not able to hold in person rehearsals or performances for the first time in over 100 years. In Fall 2020, the UMMB held a virtual band day and virtual multibands performance. Starting Spring 2021, the UMMB was able to hold spring marching band outdoor rehearsals a few nights a week. These rehearsals complied with &lt;a href=\"Social%20distancing\"&gt;Social distancing&lt;/a&gt; guidelines regarding the ongoing pandemic by splitting the band up into sectionals every rehearsal.\nIn late May 2021, alumnus Ian Hale was announced the new Associate Director and head of percussion of the Minuteman Marching Band, replacing &lt;a href=\"Thom%20Hannum\"&gt;Thom Hannum&lt;/a&gt; after 40 years. Thom Hannum will still continue in a part-time role with the Minuteman Band.\nSongs.\nThe UMMB incorporates a pre-game show at all home football games in which several traditional songs are always played and the band marches into its traditional \"M\" formation. The Minuteman Band always features a Colonial Honor Guard made up of band members during the pre-game show. They march onto the field to the theme from \"The Patriot\" for the National Anthem. There is also a post-game \"5th quarter\" show at all football games in which the band's normal show is performed again. The band always closes its shows with Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\".\nThe Traditional Songs:\n\"Patriot\", the theme from the movie \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Patriot%20%282000%20film%29\"&gt;The Patriot&lt;/a&gt;\", was last played in 2010."
