    "title": "Gravity model",
    "text": "Gravity models are used in various &lt;a href=\"social%20sciences\"&gt;social sciences&lt;/a&gt; to predict and describe certain behaviors that mimic gravitational interaction as described in &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton\"&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/a&gt;'s law of &lt;a href=\"gravity\"&gt;gravity&lt;/a&gt;. Generally, the social science models contain some elements of &lt;a href=\"mass\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; and distance, which lends them to the metaphor of physical gravity. A gravity model provides an estimate of the volume of flows of, for example, goods, services, or people between two or more locations. This could be the movement of people between cities\n or the volume of trade between countries.\nA gravity model cannot accurately predict flows, but is instead a measure against which actual observed values can be compared, highlighting where those flows are unexpectedly high or low. \nSocial science gravity models:"
