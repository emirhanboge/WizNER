Blumhoffer Nachfolger GmbH\" started to produce Bluna. It became a hit among consumers. In 1965, it also started being sold in cans.\nToday, Bluna is sold in four flavors: &lt;a href=\"orange%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt; (the original flavor), &lt;a href=\"lime%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;lime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lemon\"&gt;lemon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"mandarin%20orange\"&gt;mandarin orange&lt;/a&gt;. It is sold in both 1- or 2-Liter bottles in stores and smaller 0.33-Liter bottles for &lt;a href=\"restaurant\"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAdvertisement slogans for Bluna like \"Sind wir nicht alle ein bisschen Bluna?\" (\"Aren't we all a bit Bluna?\") and \"Wie Bluna bist Du?\" (\"How Bluna are you?\") have been very successful and the former has found its way into everyday language as shown by it being mentioned on several different internet forums and blogs.\nBluna was exported to Saudi Arabia from Germany during the 1980s and early 1990s, Today it's locally produced."
