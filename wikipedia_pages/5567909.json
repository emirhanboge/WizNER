    "title": "SS Arcadia (1953)",
    "text": "SS \" Arcadia\" was a &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20liner\"&gt;passenger liner&lt;/a&gt; built for &lt;a href=\"P%26amp%3BO%20%28company%29\"&gt;P&amp;O&lt;/a&gt; in 1953 to service the &lt;a href=\"UK\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; route. Towards the end of her life she operated as a &lt;a href=\"cruise%20ship\"&gt;cruise ship&lt;/a&gt;, based in &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, until scrapped in 1979.\nHistory.\nThe \"Arcadia\" was built for P&amp;O by &lt;a href=\"John%20Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Company\"&gt;John Brown &amp; Company&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Clydebank\"&gt;Clydebank&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, at an estimated cost of \u00a35 million; her keel was laid in 1952 and she was launched on 14 May 1953, just a couple of hours after the &lt;a href=\"SS%20Orsova%20%281953%29\"&gt;\"Orsova\"&lt;/a&gt; of the associated Orient Line went down the ways at Barrow in Furness. Her maiden voyage commenced on 22 February 1954, sailing from Tilbury in the UK to Fremantle in Western Australia via the &lt;a href=\"Suez%20Canal\"&gt;Suez Canal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aden\"&gt;Aden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bombay\"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colombo\"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt;. \"Arcadia\" had a virtually identical sister in the Belfast-built &lt;a href=\"SS%20Iberia%20%281954%29\"&gt;SS \"Iberia\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the return trip to Australia, \"Arcadia\" made a series of cruises from Southampton before embarking for Australia again in October 1954. This mix of liner and cruise trade was expanded in 1959 when Arcadia made her first cruise voyage from an Australian port, sailing from Sydney on a short cruise in November and then to San Francisco in December.\nAs the number of passengers travelling by ship to Australia declined due to growth in air travel, P&amp;O was expanding its cruise network. In 1959, \"Arcadia\" was refitted (with refurbished cabins and air-conditioning extended to all the accommodation) and throughout the 1960s continued the pattern of line voyages interspersed with cruises from Britain and Australia, including trans-Pacific routes, some of which took her through the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal\"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt;. Following another refit in 1970, she became a full-time one-class cruise ship. For the next four years she worked the west coast of America, making a series of summer cruises to Alaska and winter cruises to Mexico. In 1975 \"Arcadia\" moved its base to Australia (replacing the \"Himalaya\"), making a final return trip to Britain and then cruising Asia-Pacific routes until in February 1979 she was delivered to a firm in Taiwan to be scrapped.\nUnlike her sister, \"Arcadia\" was a reliable and popular ship and whereas \"Iberia\" was the first of the post war fleet to be scrapped (in 1972), \"Arcadia\" sailed on to be the last of these ships in service.\nIn 1974, when \"Arcadia\" sailed up the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20River\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willamette%20River\"&gt;Willamette River&lt;/a&gt;s to reach &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, on the first leg of a cruise from &lt;a href=\"Vancouver\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, she was the largest passenger ship ever to have visited Portland up to that time. From 1975 until scrapped in &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; in 1979, her cruising role out of Sydney was full-time. She was replaced by P&amp;O's then newly acquired &lt;a href=\"Mona%20Lisa%20%28ship%29\"&gt;\"Sea Princess\"&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the &lt;a href=\"MS%20Kungsholm%20%281965%29\"&gt;\"Kungsholm\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nIncidents.\nWhile undocking at Tilbury in September 1954, the tug \"Cervia\" crossed \"Arcadia's\" wash while listing from the strain on the towline, and the combination caused the tug to capsize and sink with the loss of five of her eleven crew.\nIn June 1961 \"Arcadia\" hove to off Hawaii to embark a troupe of Polynesian dancers, and as she made way to dock failed to make the tight turn required and ran onto a coral reef, where she was stuck fast for two days but with little damage.\nTwo crew committed suicide by jumping overboard, in 1954 and 1971.\nBattling strong winds on arriving at Tilbury in 1962, the anchor was lowered in an attempt to hold \"Arcadia\" in place. The wind turned the ship onto the anchor and a 19-foot hole was torn in the bow.\nIn the early hours of Friday 2 June 1978 the \"Arcadia\" ran into a wild storm coming back into Sydney and was hit by a rogue wave which caused extensive damage to the ship. It folded the life raft stairs in half. It also flooded the ship down to C Deck. \"Arcadia\" was sent back to Asia for repairs before it could sail again.\nPopular culture.\n\"SS Arcadia\" appeared as stock footage in the 1964 \"&lt;a href=\"Perry%20Mason%20%281957%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Perry Mason&lt;/a&gt;\" episode \"Nautical Knot\", set near &lt;a href=\"Acapulco\"&gt;Acapulco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The episode only shows the ship at the dockside, though its size near the pier makes an impression on the episode's characters.\nA ship by the same name appears in the fifth \"&lt;a href=\"Jurassic%20Park\"&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/a&gt;\" sequel, \"\". It is unclear what, if any, connection this ship has to the actual \"SS Arcadia\". In the film, the ship is used to evacuate genetically resurrected dinosaurs from their ill-fated island home due to a long dormant volcano becoming active again."
