He plays for the &lt;a href=\"Sharks%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt; franchise as a &lt;a href=\"centre%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;centre&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and career.\nKoster was educated at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Andrew%27s%20College%2C%20Grahamstown\"&gt;St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown&lt;/a&gt;, and played rugby for the school. For his performances during &lt;a href=\"Craven%20Week\"&gt;Craven Week&lt;/a&gt;, he was called up to play for &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Province%20Elephants\"&gt;Eastern Province Elephants&lt;/a&gt; to play for their Country Districts team in 2017 but left them to join the Sharks youth system in 2018. In the same year, he played for the &lt;a href=\"Sharks%20%28Currie%20Cup%29\"&gt;Sharks' Currie Cup team&lt;/a&gt; when they won the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Under-19%20Provincial%20Championship\"&gt;2018 Under-19 Provincial Championship&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Bulls\"&gt;Blue Bulls&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, Koster played for the Sharks XV in the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Challenge%20%28South%20Africa%29\"&gt;Rugby Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the year, he was invited to a &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa%20national%20under-20%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;South Africa national under-20 rugby union team&lt;/a&gt; selection camp for the Junior Springboks in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20World%20Rugby%20Under%2020%20Championship\"&gt;2019 World Rugby Under 20 Championship&lt;/a&gt;, however he was not selected. In 2020, he was added to the Sharks' &lt;a href=\"2020%20Super%20Rugby%20season\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt; squad. However, a few months later, the season was cancelled due to the &lt;a href=\"Impact%20of%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic%20on%20sports%23Rugby%20union\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The teams from South Africa instead played in the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby%20Unlocked\"&gt;Super Rugby Unlocked&lt;/a&gt; tournament over October and November.\nIn 2021, Koster made his professional rugby debut for the Sharks against the &lt;a href=\"Griquas%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Griquas&lt;/a&gt; in the Preparation Series. However he missed the start of the &lt;a href=\"Pro14%20Rainbow%20Cup\"&gt;Pro14 Rainbow Cup&lt;/a&gt; due to injury. On 10 July, he was selected to play for the Sharks in their second match against the touring &lt;a href=\"British%20and%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British and Irish Lions&lt;/a&gt;, paired in the centre with &lt;a href=\"Werner%20Kok\"&gt;Werner Kok&lt;/a&gt;. This followed the Lions having to rearrange &lt;a href=\"2021%20British%20%26amp%3B%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa\"&gt;their tour&lt;/a&gt; after their match against the &lt;a href=\"Bulls%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Bulls&lt;/a&gt; was suspended following a COVID-19 outbreak in the Bulls team."
