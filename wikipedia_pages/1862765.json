He was also a candidate in &lt;a href=\"2013%20Iranian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2013 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; and received 3,884,412 votes. He ranked fourth behind winner &lt;a href=\"Hassan%20Rouhani\"&gt;Hassan Rouhani&lt;/a&gt;, runner-up &lt;a href=\"Mohammad%20Bagher%20Ghalibaf\"&gt;Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saeed%20Jalili\"&gt;Saeed Jalili&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education.\nRezaee was born in &lt;a href=\"Masjed%20Soleyman%20County\"&gt;Masjed Soleyman&lt;/a&gt; on 9 September 1954 to a religious &lt;a href=\"Bakhtiari%20people\"&gt;Bakhtiyari&lt;/a&gt; nomadic family. He spent his childhood and adolescence in the oil-rich city of &lt;a href=\"Masjed%20Soleyman\"&gt;Masjed Soleyman&lt;/a&gt; (Irsoleym\u0101n) in southwestern Iran.\nAlong with his close friends, he established the \"Religion and Science Association\". When he was to begin studying at a school run by &lt;a href=\"National%20Iranian%20Oil%20Company\"&gt;National Iranian Oil Company&lt;/a&gt; (NIOC) in 1969, Rezaee moved to the city of &lt;a href=\"Ahvaz\"&gt;Ahvaz&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt high school, he started his political and cultural struggle against the &lt;a href=\"Shah\"&gt;Shah&lt;/a&gt;'s regime. In the last year of high school, he was arrested by the Shah Security service &lt;a href=\"SAVAK\"&gt;SAVAK&lt;/a&gt; in Ahvaz, and interrogated. He was 17 when he served five months in solitary confinement. He did not stop his political activities after he was released from prison.\nRezaee arrived in &lt;a href=\"Tehran\"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; in 1974 to study &lt;a href=\"mechanical%20engineering\"&gt;mechanical engineering&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Iran%20University%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology\"&gt;Iran University of Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt;. He studied and worked at the same time. SAVAK intensified its crackdown on guerrilla groups to which he was a member. He had to abandon the university.\nHe launched provincial branches of Mansouroun guerrilla fighters in seven provinces. When &lt;a href=\"Ruhollah%20Khomeini\"&gt;Ruhollah Khomeini&lt;/a&gt; returned home from exile, the Mansouroun group was tasked with protecting the revolutionary leader. After the &lt;a href=\"1979%20Islamic%20Revolution\"&gt;1979 Islamic Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, seven armed Muslim groups teamed up and established the Islamic Revolution Mujahideen Organization to safeguard the nascent Islamic Revolution.\nAlthough he studied mechanical engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Rezaee switched to economics after the &lt;a href=\"Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War\"&gt;Iran\u2013Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;, studying at &lt;a href=\"Tehran%20University\"&gt;Tehran University&lt;/a&gt; and received his PhD in 2001.\nCareer.\nRezaee joined the &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20Revolutionary%20Guard%20Corps\"&gt;Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps&lt;/a&gt; (IRGC) and later was appointed chief of its intelligence division. He was appointed as the IRGC commander by &lt;a href=\"Ruhollah%20Khomeini\"&gt;Ruhollah Khomeini&lt;/a&gt;, and after it grew in organizational complexity he assumed the office of IRGC's commander-in-chief on 11 September 1981, when he was 27 years old, and remained in the post until he announced his retirement from all of his military posts. He actively participated in the &lt;a href=\"Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War\"&gt;Iran\u2013Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;. In 1986, he was named member of the Supreme Defense Council.\nRezaee was removed from the IRGC in 1997 due to pressures from the followers of the then president &lt;a href=\"Mohammad%20Khatami\"&gt;Mohammad Khatami&lt;/a&gt;. Another reason for his dismissal was his failure to respond to the perceived threat of attack from the US. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Yahya%20Rahim%20Safavi\"&gt;Yahya Rahim Safavi&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe became a member of &lt;a href=\"Expediency%20Discernment%20Council\"&gt;Expediency Discernment Council&lt;/a&gt; and then, its secretary in August 1997. He was also appointed chair of the commission for macroeconomics and commerce. In addition, he is a reviewer of Iran's 2025 versions development.\nRezaee founded the news website &lt;a href=\"Tabnak\"&gt;Tabnak&lt;/a&gt;, originally Baztab, in 2002 as a reaction to proliferation of reformist websites. He also co-founded &lt;a href=\"Imam%20Hossein%20University\"&gt;Imam Hossein University&lt;/a&gt; and teaches there.\nIt is reported that he returned to IRGC in 2015.\nPresidential campaigns.\nRezaee was a candidate of the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Iranian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;presidential election of 2005&lt;/a&gt;, but withdrew on 15 June 2005, only two days before the election. Rezaee mentioned he was withdrawing from the race for \"the integration of the votes of the nation\" and \"their effectiveness\". He did not endorse any candidate.\nOn 23 April 2009, he announced that he entered the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Iranian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2009 presidential&lt;/a&gt; race, after trying to find another conservative to run against President Ahmadinejad which he lost. He was also a candidate in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Iranian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2013 election&lt;/a&gt;. Rezaee announced his run for presidency in October 2012.\nOn 12 December 2016, Rezaee announced that he \"has no decision to run for president\" in &lt;a href=\"2017%20Iranian%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2017 election&lt;/a&gt;. However, in February 2017 he told press that if asked by the &lt;a href=\"Popular%20Front%20of%20Islamic%20Revolutionary%20Forces\"&gt;Popular Front of Islamic Revolutionary Forces&lt;/a&gt; to stand, he \"will think about it\".\nViews.\nIn 1988, Rezaee sent a letter to Ayatollah Khomeini in which he argued that the Iran\u2013Iraq War could not be won.\nIn the run-up to the 2009 Iranian elections, Rezaee criticized opposing candidate Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's public comments questioning &lt;a href=\"the%20Holocaust\"&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; as \"not useful\" for Iran's international standing. Rezaee stated on 2 August 2009 that the ongoing trials of so-called 'prisoners' was an unjust act, issuing a letter on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Expediency%20Council\"&gt;Expediency Council&lt;/a&gt; of which he is the secretary, condemning the government.\nIn September 2019, Rezaee expressed his hope that Iran would capture US President &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and place him on trial.\nControversy.\nA clash and the disagreement over strategy to be adopted in the Iran-Iraq war emerged between &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Sayed%20Shirazi\"&gt;Ali Sayed Shirazi&lt;/a&gt;, commander of land forces, and Rezaee in July 1986. When this rivalry became public, &lt;a href=\"Ayatollah%20Khomeini\"&gt;Ayatollah Khomeini&lt;/a&gt; met them in his residence on 19 July 1986 and urged them to \"seek unity\", telling them \"You must endeavor, not to think in terms of being members of the Armed Forces or those of the Guards Corps or of the Basij forces. ... We must understand that if there were to be any disputes among you ... not only are we doomed here and now, but we also are guilty before God.\"\nIn November 2006, Argentine Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral issued international arrest warrants for Rezaee, six other Iranians, and one Lebanese in connection with the &lt;a href=\"AMIA%20bombing\"&gt;AMIA bombing&lt;/a&gt;, the attacks on 18 July 1994, a suicide bombing of the Jewish cultural center (AMIA) in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, Argentina, which resulted in the deaths of 85 people and serious injuries to 151. The attack on the Jewish cultural center came two years after the 1992 terrorist bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. In 1998, Rezaee's son, Ahmad, defected to the United States, where he told officials that the attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was planned in &lt;a href=\"Tehran\"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;. The son told U.S. authorities that he had accompanied his father to Lebanon to witness the training. Ahmad Rezaee returned to Iran after a short time and declared that his statements about his father's involvement in the bombing were baseless. Mohsen Rezaee has been on the official &lt;a href=\"Wanted%20poster\"&gt;Wanted&lt;/a&gt; list of &lt;a href=\"Interpol\"&gt;Interpol&lt;/a&gt; since March 2007, for allegations of \"Aggravated Murder and Damages\" related to the 1994 AMIA bombing case. Rezaee rejected the allegations, saying in June 2009 \"These charges were a sheer lie\".\nPersonal life.\nRezaee married in 1974. He has five children, two sons and three daughters. His eldest son, &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Rezaee\"&gt;Ahmad&lt;/a&gt;, migrated to the United States in 1998 and sought political asylum.\nAhmad spoke against the policies of the Iranian Islamic government, and accused his father and others of supporting terrorist acts. He returned to Iran in 2005, recanting his statements, then migrated to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Arab%20Emirates\"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; in 2011. On 13 November 2011, his body was found in a hotel in &lt;a href=\"Dubai\"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;. It was reported that he was killed by a hotel servant, but the Dubai Police stated that he had died after taking a large quantity of &lt;a href=\"antidepressant\"&gt;antidepressant&lt;/a&gt;s. His brother, Omidvar, is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Iran\"&gt;Parliament of Iran&lt;/a&gt; since 2008."
