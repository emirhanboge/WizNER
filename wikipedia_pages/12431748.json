    "text": "The rosy bee-eater (\"Merops malimbicus\") is a species of &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; in the family &lt;a href=\"Meropidae\"&gt;Meropidae&lt;/a&gt;. It is found in &lt;a href=\"Angola\"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benin\"&gt;Benin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burkina%20Faso\"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Coast\"&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Equatorial%20Guinea\"&gt;Equatorial Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gabon\"&gt;Gabon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghana\"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Togo\"&gt;Togo&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaxonomy.\nEnglish naturalist &lt;a href=\"George%20Shaw%20%28biologist%29\"&gt;George Shaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Species%20description\"&gt;first described&lt;/a&gt; the rosy bee-eater in 1806 as \"Merops malimbicus\". This type of locality being from Malimbe, &lt;a href=\"Cabinda%20Province\"&gt;Cabinda&lt;/a&gt; in Angola. Molecular studies suggest that this species is most closely related to the &lt;a href=\"white-throated%20bee-eater\"&gt;white-throated bee-eater&lt;/a&gt; (\"Merops albicollis\") and the &lt;a href=\"northern%20carmine%20bee-eater\"&gt;northern carmine bee-eater&lt;/a&gt; (\"M. nubicus\").\nDescription.\nThe adult is a distinctively colored bird that grows to a length of with tail-streamers adding to this, and weighing about . Both sexes have similar features. The forehead and crown are dark grey, the mask black and the chin and cheek are white. The mantle is black, the wings and back are slate-grey and the rump paler grey. The tail is carmine, gradually bleaching to grey. The throat and underparts are bright pink and the undertail coverts are grey. The undersides of the flight feathers and large tail feathers are glossy black. The beak is black, the eye reddish-brown and the leg yellowish-brown. The juvenile is similar in coloring but paler, many of the smaller feathers having pale edges.\nEcology.\nLike other &lt;a href=\"bee-eater\"&gt;bee-eater&lt;/a&gt;s, the species feeds on insects that it catches by swooping from a perch or hawking in the air. It forages in various habitats; close to the surface of water bodies, over &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;s and woodlands, as well as above the canopies of forests, sometimes ascending to considerable heights. A large part of their diet is flying &lt;a href=\"ant\"&gt;ant&lt;/a&gt;s, but these birds also feed on &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Butterfly\"&gt;butterflies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragonfly\"&gt;dragonflies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grasshopper\"&gt;grasshopper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Fly\"&gt;flies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"beetle\"&gt;beetle&lt;/a&gt;s. Foraging flocks may be very large and birds may dip into the water during flight to bathe. Nesting takes place on raised beaches and sandbars of large rivers exposed by falling water levels. Holes are dug with the feet and passages may be or so long. Only a few colonies are known but these may be very large, with estimated nest counts of 8,000 to 27,300 or more, and a density of about two nesting holes per square met. The colony may nest in the same location the following year but the nests have been inundated during the rainy season and need to be re-excavated."
