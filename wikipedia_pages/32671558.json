However, this information has not been confirmed.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Russian%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2016 legislative election&lt;/a&gt;, the previous Chairman of the State Duma &lt;a href=\"Sergey%20Naryshkin\"&gt;Sergey Naryshkin&lt;/a&gt; was appointed Director of the &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Intelligence%20Service%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt;. On 23 September 2016, &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Russia\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; proposed to the United Russia to nominate Vyacheslav Volodin to the post of Chairman of the State Duma. The majority leader &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Vasilyev%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Vladimir Vasilyev&lt;/a&gt; said that the &lt;a href=\"United%20Russia\"&gt;United Russia&lt;/a&gt; faction will support the candidacy of Volodin. Candidacy Volodin also supported the faction of the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Liberal Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Just%20Russia\"&gt;A Just Russia&lt;/a&gt;. On 5 October, Vyacheslav Volodin was elected Chairman of the State Duma, received 404 votes. His only rival was the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dmitry%20Novikov\"&gt;Dmitry Novikov&lt;/a&gt;, who received 40 votes.\n2021.\nIn 2021, Volodin was again nominated to the chairmanship of the &lt;a href=\"8th%20State%20Duma\"&gt;8th State Duma&lt;/a&gt;. His candidacy was again endorsed by the Liberal Democratic Party and A Just Russia \u2014 For Truth. The only opponent of Volodin was again the candidate from the Communist Party Dmitry Novikov. On 12 October, Vyacheslav Volodin was re\u2013elected Chairman of the State Duma, received 360 votes.\nTenure.\nIn October 2016, he was among the three most influential politicians in Russia (after &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Putin\"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dmitry%20Medvedev\"&gt;Dmitry Medvedev&lt;/a&gt;) by rating of the Center for Political Technologies. According to a survey conducted by the expert-analytical center of &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Presidential%20Academy%20of%20National%20Economy%20and%20Public%20Administration\"&gt;RANEPA&lt;/a&gt;, the level of recognition of Vyacheslav Volodin is at a high level. 83% of respondents know that he holds the post of Chairman of the State Duma. In addition, 78% of Russians have a positive or neutral view of Volodin's activities as Chairman of the State Duma.\nOn 24 November 2016, he was elected Chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the &lt;a href=\"Collective%20Security%20Treaty%20Organization\"&gt;Collective Security Treaty Organization&lt;/a&gt; and on 26 December 2016 he was elected Chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20State\"&gt;Union State&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Chairman, Volodin actively began to deal with the discipline of deputies. At first he forbade deputies to vote by proxy for other deputies. In this connection, the deputies have to attend the meetings in person. Fines for missing meetings without a valid reason were also introduced.\nOn 6 March 2019, Vyacheslav Volodin, during a meeting of the State Duma, interrupted the report of the Minister of Economic Development &lt;a href=\"Maxim%20Oreshkin\"&gt;Maxim Oreshkin&lt;/a&gt; and did not allow him to finish his speech. Volodin accused him of being unprepared and offered to report again in a month (usually such reports pass only once a year). According to some deputies, this case is the first in the entire post-Soviet history of Russia.\nOn 6 April 2019, Volodin proposed amendments to the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; allowing the State Duma to participate more actively in the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Russia\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;. According to him, the State Duma should at least participate in consultations when appointing members of the government (currently, the participation of the State Duma in the formation of the government is limited only by the fact that it must give consent to the President to appoint the Prime Minister). Volodin said that the participation of the State Duma in the formation of the government \"would be consistent with the principles of proper balance of power\" and \"would provide a higher level of responsibility\" in the work of Ministers. In July 2019, Volodin again called for the introduction of appropriate amendments to the Constitution in his article in the \"Parliamentary Newspaper\". Later, Volodin's proposal was supported by the leaders of all opposition parliamentary parties. In January 2020, President Vladimir Putin proposed introducing such amendments during his &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Address%20to%20the%20Federal%20Assembly\"&gt;Address to the Federal Assembly&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 2019, Volodin threatened Ukraine in his speech that due to nationalism and oppression of ethnic minorities there is a chance that some oblasts may separate from Ukraine.\nPossible presidential bid.\nDespite the fact that Volodin actively supports Vladimir Putin (for example, he says that \"no Putin - no Russia\"), many experts talk about his presidential ambitions. So in 2012, one of his friends in an interview with \"&lt;a href=\"Reuters\"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;\" said that considers Volodin the future President, as \"he has a desire to fly high\". Another close to Volodin man said: \"an ordinary person in the afternoon thinking about plans for the evening. Volodin does not think about plans for the evening - he has a plan for life. When he was Vice Mayor of Saratov, he already said to friends that he would become President of Russia.\" In addition, in 2015, the cleric &lt;a href=\"Vsevolod%20Chaplin\"&gt;Vsevolod Chaplin&lt;/a&gt;, commenting on the article in the \"&lt;a href=\"Izvestia\"&gt;Izvestia&lt;/a&gt;\" about the personal life of a number of political figures of Russia, also spoke about the presidential ambitions of Volodin.\nOn 20 April 2017, at the meeting of the organizing committee for the Victory Day, which was held by President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Organization of Veterans of the War in Afghanistan &lt;a href=\"Andrey%20Chepurnoy\"&gt;Andrey Chepurnoy&lt;/a&gt; spoke. He criticized Senator &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Klintsevich\"&gt;Franz Klintsevich&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman of the Russian Union of Veterans of Afghanistan. He spoke about the letter of Klintsevich, in which he indicates Volodin as the next President. Commenting on this speech, Putin said that \"the successor to the President is determined only by the Russian people in the democratic elections \u2014 and no one else\". Later Klintsevich denied the words of Chepurnoy and called it slander. At the same time, one of the members of the Moscow organization \"Safe Capital\" said that Klintsevich really mentioned the presidential ambitions of Volodin. \"At one of the meetings in 2016 with our organization Klintsevich said that it is necessary to support Volodin in all his endeavors, because he, according to Klintsevich, will be the next President of Russia\". According to political scientist &lt;a href=\"Stanislav%20Belkovsky\"&gt;Stanislav Belkovsky&lt;/a&gt;, Volodin has presidential ambitions, but he is not going to be President \"instead of Putin\", and will agree to become president only if Putin offers him."
