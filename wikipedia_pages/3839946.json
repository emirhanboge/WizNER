She was sold at auction along with other L&amp;B equipment in November 1935, two months after the railway closed. However, she was purchased in December by a dismantler and was used to remove the line until July 1936.\nOn 28 September 1936, \"Lew\" sailed from &lt;a href=\"Swansea\"&gt;Swansea&lt;/a&gt;, on the \u2013 believed to have been destined for a plantation in Brazil. \"Sabor\" arrived in Pernambuco on 15 October 1936. \"Sabor\" left Pernambuco on 17 October, called at Bahia on 20 October, and arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 23 October.\nDespite the efforts of many enthusiasts, no proof of the locomotive's current whereabouts, or eventual fate has been published.\n\"Lyd\".\nA replica of \"Lew\", named \"&lt;a href=\"Lyd%20%28locomotive%29\"&gt;Lyd&lt;/a&gt;\" in accordance with the L&amp;B tradition of naming its locos after local three-letter rivers, was completed at &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Lodge\"&gt;Boston Lodge&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Ffestiniog%20Railway\"&gt;Ffestiniog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Highland%20Railway\"&gt;Welsh Highland Railway&lt;/a&gt; in August 2010."
