    "text": "The Ikhshids (, \"Ruler\") were a series of rulers of &lt;a href=\"Soghdia\"&gt;Soghdia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Farghana\"&gt;Ferghana Valley&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Transoxiana\"&gt;Transoxiana&lt;/a&gt; during the pre-Islamic and early Islamic periods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"princely\"&gt;princely&lt;/a&gt; title \"Ikhshid\" is of &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20languages\"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; origin; scholars have derived it variously from the Old Iranian root \"khshaeta\", \"shining, brilliant\", or from \"khsh\u0101yathiya\", \"ruler, king\" (which is also the origin of the title \"&lt;a href=\"shah\"&gt;shah&lt;/a&gt;\"). The Ikhshids of Soghdia, with their capital at &lt;a href=\"Samarkand\"&gt;Samarkand&lt;/a&gt;, are well attested during and after the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Transoxiana\"&gt;Muslim conquest of Transoxiana&lt;/a&gt;.\nIkhshids dynasty of Sogdia.\nShishpir, originally ruler of &lt;a href=\"Shahrisabz\"&gt;Kish&lt;/a&gt;, conquered &lt;a href=\"Samarkand\"&gt;Samarkand&lt;/a&gt; in 631-642 CE and founded the Ikhshid dynasty. His rule in Samarkand followed that of the &lt;a href=\"Hephthalites\"&gt;Hunnic tribes&lt;/a&gt; who had taken control of the city since around 437 CE. The founder Shishpir was succeeded by several generations of kings, who are recorded in Chinese chronicles and known through their coinage.\nThe Hunnic legacy appears in the coinage of Shishpir, as he adopted the Hunnic Y-shaped &lt;a href=\"tamgha\"&gt;tamgha&lt;/a&gt; () on the reverse of his coins. The symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Hephthalites\"&gt;Hephthalites&lt;/a&gt; thus appears on the residual coinage of &lt;a href=\"Samarkand\"&gt;Samarkand&lt;/a&gt;, probably as a consequence of the Hephthalite control of Sogdia, and becomes prominent in Sogdian coinage until the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Transoxiana\"&gt;Muslim conquest of Transoxiana&lt;/a&gt;.\nInscriptions found in the ruins of the Ikhshid palace at Samarkand and the legends of coins suggest that the Ikhsids called their own dynasty \"Unash\", i.e. \"Hunnish\". The paintings of the &lt;a href=\"Afrasiab%20murals\"&gt;Afrasiab murals&lt;/a&gt;, made in the early Ikhshid period, contain an inscription mentioning King \"&lt;a href=\"Varkhuman\"&gt;Varkhuman&lt;/a&gt; Unash\"\nAfrasiab murals.\nThe paintings of Afrasiab in Samarkand date back to the middle of the 7th century CE at the early stage of the Ilkhshid period, showing a reception of foreign dignitaries by Ikhshid king &lt;a href=\"Varkhuman\"&gt;Varkhuman&lt;/a&gt;. They were probably painted circa 655 CE, as the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Turkic%20Khaganate\"&gt;Western Turkic Khaganate&lt;/a&gt;, members of which appear abundantly in the mural, was in its last days before its fall in 657 CE, and the Tang Dynasty was increasing its territory in Central Asia. On the four walls of the room of a private house, three or four countries in neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Central%20Asia\"&gt;Central Asia&lt;/a&gt; are depicted. On the northern wall &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; (a Chinese festival, with the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20of%20China\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt; on a boat, and the Emperor hunting), on the Southern Wall Samarkand (i.e.; the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Persia\"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; world: a religious funerary procession in honor of the ancestors during the &lt;a href=\"Nowruz\"&gt;Nowruz&lt;/a&gt; festival), on the eastern wall &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; (as the land of the &lt;a href=\"astrologer\"&gt;astrologer&lt;/a&gt;s and of the &lt;a href=\"pygmies\"&gt;pygmies&lt;/a&gt;, but the painting is much destroyed there).\nChinese protectorate.\nThe Ikhshids became nominal vassals of the Chinese &lt;a href=\"Tang%20dynasty\"&gt;Tang dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The Chinese asserted their political power in Central Asia at the expense of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Turks\"&gt;Western Turks&lt;/a&gt;, through the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Anxi%20Protectorate\"&gt;Anxi Protectorate&lt;/a&gt; and the formal appointment of local rulers to Governor positions in the provinces established by the Chinese. As soon as 650-655 CE, &lt;a href=\"Varkhuman\"&gt;Varkhuman&lt;/a&gt; was recognized by the Chinese as \"King of &lt;a href=\"Kangju\"&gt;Kangju&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Sogdia\"&gt;Sogdia&lt;/a&gt;), and Governor, as reported by Chinese chronicles:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Western%20Turks\"&gt;Western Turks&lt;/a&gt;, who had been the main power for about a century in the region, disintegrated following the Tang &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20of%20the%20Western%20Turks\"&gt;Conquest of the Western Turks&lt;/a&gt; and the demise of their ruler &lt;a href=\"Ashina%20Helu\"&gt;Ashina Helu&lt;/a&gt; in 658 CE, becoming vassals of the Chinese thereafter.\nDuring this period, the Ikhshids and other Central Asian polities repeatedly requested Chinese military aid, but these requests were generally met with empty promises, as the Chinese army, led by general &lt;a href=\"Gao%20Xianzhi\"&gt;Gao Xianzhi&lt;/a&gt;, was busy with the war against &lt;a href=\"Tibet\"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpilogue.\nThe line survived into &lt;a href=\"Abbasid\"&gt;Abbasid&lt;/a&gt; times, although by then its seat was in &lt;a href=\"Ishtikhon\"&gt;Istikhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nGhurak.\nAmong the most notable and energetic of the Soghdian kings was &lt;a href=\"Ghurak\"&gt;Ghurak&lt;/a&gt;, who in 710 overthrew his predecessor &lt;a href=\"Tarkhun\"&gt;Tarkhun&lt;/a&gt; and for almost thirty years, through shifting alliances, managed to preserve a precarious autonomy between the expanding &lt;a href=\"Umayyad%20Caliphate\"&gt;Umayyad Caliphate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"T%C3%BCrgesh\"&gt;T\u00fcrgesh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"khaganate\"&gt;khaganate&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 718, Ghurak is known to have sent an embassy to the China court, asking for support against the Arabs, but military help was denied, probably because of the huge cost and distances involved:\nIn retaliation, the Arab governor may have appointed &lt;a href=\"Divashtich\"&gt;Divashtich&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler of nearby &lt;a href=\"Panjikent\"&gt;Panjikent&lt;/a&gt;, as ruler of Samarkand in order to replace Ghurak. Some of the coinage of Samarkand may have been issued by Divashtich, and may correspond to this period. The power of the Arabs in the region continued to increase, as they defeated the rebellion of Divastich in 722 CE.\nTurgar.\nThe reign of the last Ikhshid ruler &lt;a href=\"Turgar\"&gt;Turgar&lt;/a&gt; seems to have enjoyed a relative period of prosperity, under the rather benevolent supervision of the Muslim &lt;a href=\"Umayyad\"&gt;Umayyad&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href=\"Nasr%20ibn%20Sayyar\"&gt;Nasr ibn Sayyar&lt;/a&gt;. This continued until the revolt of &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Muslim\"&gt;Abu Muslim&lt;/a&gt; and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Abbasid%20Caliphate\"&gt;Abbasid Caliphate&lt;/a&gt; in 750 CE, after which Sogdians had to convert to &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;.\nTurgar sent an embassy to China in 750 CE, probably asking for support. Hopes of Chinese support for the Ikhshids soon evaporated, with their strategic defeat against the Arabs at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Talas\"&gt;Battle of Talas&lt;/a&gt; and the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Anxi%20Protectorate\"&gt;Anxi Protectorate&lt;/a&gt; in 751 CE. With the domestic &lt;a href=\"An%20Lushan%20Rebellion\"&gt;An Lushan Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in 755 CE, the Chinese had to removed all of their remaining forces from Central Asia, depriving the Ikhshids of any kind of diplomatic support against the Arabs.\nTurgar was probably deposed circa 755-757 CE, and stopped minting coinage. Coins of Arabo-Sogdian style were now being minted in Samarkand in the name of the Governor of &lt;a href=\"Khurasan\"&gt;Khurasan&lt;/a&gt; Abu Dawud Khalid ibn Ibrahim. The only Sogdian resistance now took the form of internal social or religious rebellions, within the framework of the Muslim Caliphate.\nCoinage.\nThe Ikhshids issues mostly copper coins on the Chinese model (&lt;a href=\"Kaiyuan%20Tongbao\"&gt;Kaiyuan Tongbao&lt;/a&gt; type, round with a central square hole), with legends in &lt;a href=\"Aramaic%20script\"&gt;Aramaic&lt;/a&gt; and Sogdian giving the name and title of the ruler. The Aramaic legend uses the title \"&lt;a href=\"Malik\"&gt;MLKA&lt;/a&gt;\" \"King\", the Sogdian legend uses the title \"x\u0161\u0113\u03b4\" (\"Ikhshid\", \"Ruler\"). The Ikhshids also issued a few silver coin on the &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Sasanian&lt;/a&gt; model, with face of the ruler on the obverse, and fire altar on the reverse. The Hunnic Y-shaped &lt;a href=\"tamgha\"&gt;tamgha&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Hephthalites\"&gt;Hephthalites&lt;/a&gt; () appears on the reverse of these coins. The second symbol (to the right) is the &lt;a href=\"triskelion\"&gt;triskelion&lt;/a&gt;, symbol of &lt;a href=\"Shahrisabz\"&gt;Kish&lt;/a&gt;, from where Shishpir, the founder of the Ikhshids, originated.\nOther uses of the title \"Ikhshid\".\nThe Arab authors report that the title was also used by the ruler of Ferghana during the same period: &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20al-Athir\"&gt;Ibn al-Athir&lt;/a&gt; reports that it was the \"ikhshid\" of Ferghana who called upon the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Dynasty\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; for aid against the Arabs, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Talas\"&gt;Battle of Talas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe title's prestige in Central Asia remained high as late as the 10th century, when it was adopted by the &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20peoples\"&gt;Turkic&lt;/a&gt; commander and ruler of &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20ibn%20Tughj\"&gt;Muhammad ibn Tughj&lt;/a&gt;, whose grandfather had come from Ferghana. After his title the short-lived dynasty founded by Muhammad al-Ikhshid is known as the &lt;a href=\"Ikhshidid%20dynasty\"&gt;Ikhshidid dynasty&lt;/a&gt;."
