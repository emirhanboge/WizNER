    "text": "Antidorcas australis, also known as the southern springbok, is an extinct species of &lt;a href=\"antelope\"&gt;antelope&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Pleistocene\"&gt;Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holocene\"&gt;Holocene&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It is a close relative of the living &lt;a href=\"springbok\"&gt;springbok&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaxonomy.\nFirst recovered from Mid Pleistocene deposits at &lt;a href=\"Swartklip\"&gt;Swartklip&lt;/a&gt; along\nthe southern coast of South Africa, the southern springbok was originally described as (and is sometimes still considered) a subspecies of the modern springbok\n(as \"Antidorcas marsupialis australis\").\nIt was subsequently elevated to species level, as its presence at &lt;a href=\"Swartkrans\"&gt;Swartkrans&lt;/a&gt; suggested a wide temporal and geographic distribution worthy of a valid species, and its taxonomic validity was further strengthened when remains were found together with \"&lt;a href=\"Antidorcas%20recki\"&gt;Antidorcas recki&lt;/a&gt;\", the presumed ancestor of modern springbok, in Early-Mid Pleistocene deposits.\nThe genus \"Antidorcas\" evolved from an ancestral \"Gazella\" species more than 3\nmillion years ago in East Africa and gave rise to \"A. australis\", \"&lt;a href=\"Antidorcas%20bondi\"&gt;Antidorcas bondi&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"A. recki\". The southern springbok, along with \"A. bondi\", became extinct perhaps as recently as 7,000 years ago; at a minimum, fossils have been documented in the very latest Pleistocene deposits at Nelson Bay Cave (13,430 to 14,140 BP).\nPaleoecology.\nThe southern springbok was associated with open-habitat species such as equids and alcelaphine antelopes. Like extant springbok, the southern springbok was probably a mixed feeder, capable of browsing dicots when grasses became unpalatable or scarce.\nSee also.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Megalotragus\"&gt;Megalotragus&lt;/a&gt;\", another extinct African antelope from the Pleistocene-Holocene border."
