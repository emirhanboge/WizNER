He saw action in Africa and in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Second Boer War&lt;/a&gt; as a young officer, and went to France with his battalion at the start of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;.

Following the armistice, he commanded a division in the forces occupying Germany, and then held various commands until he retired from the army in 1938.\nFrom 1925 onwards he served as a magistrate and county councillor in Hampshire, and after retirement increased his involvement with local administration. He chaired a series of local bodies, and in 1941 was elected to the House of Commons for the constituency of &lt;a href=\"Petersfield%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Petersfield&lt;/a&gt;. He retired from Parliament at the 1951 election, and was created a peer the following year, as Baron Jeffreys. He continued to sit in the House of Lords until his death in 1960.\nEarly life and family.\nGeorge Darrell Jeffreys was born on 8 March 1878. His father, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Frederick%20Jeffreys\"&gt;Arthur Frederick Jeffreys&lt;/a&gt;, was a rural landowner, with an estate at &lt;a href=\"Burkham\"&gt;Burkham&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Alton%2C%20Hampshire\"&gt;Alton, Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;; he was later elected to Parliament, as a Conservative, and held the seat for almost thirty years. He married Amy Fenwick in 1877; they had four children, George and his three younger sisters.\nJeffreys was educated at &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton College&lt;/a&gt; before entering the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst\"&gt;Royal Military College, Sandhurst&lt;/a&gt;. He passed out of Sandhurst in 1897, and was commissioned as a &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grenadier%20Guards\"&gt;Grenadier Guards&lt;/a&gt; on 3 May 1897.\nIn 1905, he married Dorothy, Viscountess Cantelupe. She was the widow of Lionel Sackville, Viscount Cantelupe, the eldest son of the &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Sackville%2C%207th%20Earl%20De%20La%20Warr\"&gt;Earl De La Warr&lt;/a&gt;, an officer in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20West%20Kent%20Regiment\"&gt;Royal West Kent Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, who had died a few months after their marriage in 1890. The two had one son, Christopher, a captain in the Grenadier Guards, who died in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20France\"&gt;Battle of France&lt;/a&gt; in 1940.\nMilitary career.\nWith his regiment, Jeffreys took part in the Sudan expedition of 1898, and saw action at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Omdurman\"&gt;Battle of Omdurman&lt;/a&gt;. He was promoted to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; later that year, on 28 November 1898, and later served two stints in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Second Boer War&lt;/a&gt;, in 1900\u20131901, and again from April 1902. Following the end of the war two months later, he returned with most of the men of the guards regiments on board the SS \"Lake Michigan\", which arrived in Southampton in October 1902. He remained on regimental service, promoted to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28BARM%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; in October 1903 and &lt;a href=\"Major%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; in October 1910, until he was promoted to command the Guards Depot in June 1911.\nOn the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; in August 1914, Jeffreys rejoined his regiment, and went overseas with the &lt;a href=\"British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%281914%29\"&gt;British Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt;. He saw service at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mons\"&gt;Battle of Mons&lt;/a&gt; with the 2nd Battalion, and was promoted to command it in June 1915, with the temporary rank of &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20colonel\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt;.

On 30 December he again was transferred to command the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Guards%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;1st Guards Brigade&lt;/a&gt;, holding command through most of 1917 until he returned to the 19th Division as its new commander in September, with a corresponding promotion to temporary &lt;a href=\"major%20general\"&gt;major general&lt;/a&gt;.

The 30th Division was assigned to the rear area ports, and was correspondingly later to demobilise.
