Manager &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Melvin\"&gt;Bob Melvin&lt;/a&gt; said Whitesell would get a chance to play every day, and that Tracy \"is going to pinch hit, (and) he's going to fill in at third and first for a while.\" That did not last long, however, as on May 19, not even two weeks later, Melvin had been fired as manager and the team optioned Whitesell back to Reno.\nA right-oblique strain that Tracy suffered May 29 led to him being placed on the 15-day &lt;a href=\"disabled%20list\"&gt;disabled list&lt;/a&gt;.

Right now, there are a lot of question marks, especially for me, and some of the other guys that are on their last year of their contract or have some value to be traded, so I think we're probably at that point now where anything can happen. I wouldn't be surprised by anything. Manager AJ Hinch spoke with Tracy, who was batting a career-low .222 with a .288 on-base percentage at the time, and Whitesell on July 17. He told them that Whitesell would get the bulk of the action at first base, starting four or five times a week \"for the time being\".
