    "text": "This is a list of oldest and youngest National Basketball Association players. The &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association\"&gt;National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt; (NBA) is a men's professional &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; league in North America. The NBA was founded in 1946 as the &lt;a href=\"Basketball%20Association%20of%20America\"&gt;Basketball Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (BAA). The league adopted its current name at the start of the when it merged with the &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20League%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Basketball League&lt;/a&gt; (NBL). The oldest person ever to play in the NBA was &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Hickey\"&gt;Nat Hickey&lt;/a&gt;, a coach who activated himself as a player for a game two days before his 46th birthday. The youngest player ever to play in the NBA was &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Bynum\"&gt;Andrew Bynum&lt;/a&gt;, who played his first game only six days after his 18th birthday. The oldest active player is &lt;a href=\"Miami%20Heat\"&gt;Miami Heat&lt;/a&gt; power forward &lt;a href=\"Udonis%20Haslem\"&gt;Udonis Haslem&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently 41 years old. The youngest active player in the NBA is &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20Spurs\"&gt;San Antonio Spurs&lt;/a&gt; guard &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Primo\"&gt;Joshua Primo&lt;/a&gt;, the 12th overall pick in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20NBA%20draft\"&gt;2021 NBA draft&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently 19 years old and was born on December 24, 2002.\nOldest players.\nThe oldest player ever to play in the NBA was &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Hickey\"&gt;Nat Hickey&lt;/a&gt; who played one game in the &lt;a href=\"1947%E2%80%9348%20BAA%20season\"&gt;1947\u201348 season&lt;/a&gt; when he was 45 years and 363 days old. Hickey, who was coaching the &lt;a href=\"Providence%20Steamrollers\"&gt;Providence Steamrollers&lt;/a&gt; at the time, decided to activate himself and played in a game for the Steamrollers. In his first game as a player for the Steamrollers, he missed all six of his shot attempts and only scored two points from three free throw attempts; he only played in one more game before retiring as a player two days shy of his 46th birthday. The second-oldest player is &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Willis\"&gt;Kevin Willis&lt;/a&gt;, who played 20 seasons (excluding the &lt;a href=\"1988%E2%80%9389%20NBA%20season\"&gt;1988\u201389 season&lt;/a&gt; he missed due to injury) in the league before he sat out the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20NBA%20season\"&gt;2005\u201306 season&lt;/a&gt; and earned a contract with the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Mavericks\"&gt;Dallas Mavericks&lt;/a&gt; on April 2, 2007. Willis then played five games for the Mavericks at the age of 44. The third-oldest player is &lt;a href=\"Naismith%20Memorial%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hall of Famer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Parish\"&gt;Robert Parish&lt;/a&gt;. Parish, who played with the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Celtics\"&gt;Boston Celtics&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, played his last season with the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bulls\"&gt;Chicago Bulls&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 43. He played in 1,611 regular season games during his 21-year career, more than any other player in NBA history. When the Bulls won the &lt;a href=\"1997%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;1997 Finals&lt;/a&gt;, Parish became the oldest player ever to win the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20NBA%20champions\"&gt;NBA championship&lt;/a&gt;. There are 31 players who played in the NBA after they turned 40.The oldest active player is &lt;a href=\"Udonis%20Haslem\"&gt;Udonis Haslem&lt;/a&gt;, who is now 41 years old. Haslem played his first game in the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20NBA%20season\"&gt;2003\u201304 NBA season&lt;/a&gt; and is playing his 19th season. He is the only player born before 1984 who is still active and under contract with an NBA team.\nYoungest players.\nNBA players usually come from U.S. &lt;a href=\"college%20basketball\"&gt;college basketball&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, a college player had to complete his four-year college eligibility before he could enter the league through the &lt;a href=\"NBA%20draft\"&gt;NBA draft&lt;/a&gt; or as a free agent. In the 1970s, the league began to allow college underclassmen and high school players to enter the league. However, the trend of &lt;a href=\"NBA%20high%20school%20draftees\"&gt;drafting high school players&lt;/a&gt; only began in the mid 1990s. This has led to more younger players entering the league directly after high school graduation. In 2005, the league and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Players%20Association\"&gt;players' union&lt;/a&gt; agreed on a new &lt;a href=\"collective%20bargaining\"&gt;collective bargaining&lt;/a&gt; agreement that includes a &lt;a href=\"National%20Basketball%20Association%20criticisms%20and%20controversies%23Age%20limit\"&gt;minimum age limit&lt;/a&gt; which requires that players who wish to enter the league must be at least 19 years old on December 31 of the year of the draft, and at least one year removed from high school. International players who did not play college basketball also have to be at least 19 years old on the same date to be able to play in the NBA. Despite a trend toward drafting younger players, the NBA has a higher average age than it had in the 1980s. However, since the NBA introduced the minimum age limit in 2005, the league's average age has decreased in the past few seasons.The youngest player to ever play in the NBA was &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Bynum\"&gt;Andrew Bynum&lt;/a&gt; who played his first game at the age of 18 years and 6 days old. Bynum, who was also the youngest player ever selected in the NBA Draft, went into the NBA straight out of high school. &lt;a href=\"Jermaine%20O%27Neal\"&gt;Jermaine O'Neal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kobe%20Bryant\"&gt;Kobe Bryant&lt;/a&gt;, both drafted in &lt;a href=\"1996%20NBA%20draft\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;, were the second- and third-youngest players. Serbian &lt;a href=\"Darko%20Mili%C4%8Di%C4%87\"&gt;Darko Mili\u010di\u0107&lt;/a&gt; was the youngest player ever to play in an &lt;a href=\"NBA%20Finals\"&gt;NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt; game. He played for the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Pistons\"&gt;Detroit Pistons&lt;/a&gt; in Game 3 of the &lt;a href=\"2004%20NBA%20Finals\"&gt;2004 Finals&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 18 years and 356 days old. The Pistons won the 2004 Finals and Mili\u010di\u0107 became the youngest player ever to win the NBA championship, being only five days away from his 19th birthday at the time. There are currently 28 players who played in the NBA before they turned 19. Nineteen of them came to the league straight out of high school, while 7 of them are international players who never played basketball in the U.S. high schools or colleges before they entered the NBA, and two players, &lt;a href=\"Devin%20Booker\"&gt;Devin Booker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Primo\"&gt;Joshua Primo&lt;/a&gt;, played one year of college before entering the NBA all while remaining 18 years old throughout the process."
