    "text": "Matthew \"Matt\" Preston (Phaeleh, pronounced Fella) is a multi-instrumentalist, producer and DJ, residing in &lt;a href=\"Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, England. The name came from an aesthetic decision, to stand out visually rather than having a specific meaning.\nHe produces music that could be loosely described as cinematic &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt;, but his roots are in &lt;a href=\"dubstep\"&gt;dubstep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UK%20garage\"&gt;garage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;. Phaeleh himself describes his music as \"electronic bass music\" with a heavy emphasis on melody and emotional content. His main inspirations are &lt;a href=\"Boards%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Boards of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aphex%20Twin\"&gt;Aphex Twin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"LTJ%20Bukem\"&gt;LTJ Bukem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Global%20Communication\"&gt;Global Communication&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Eno\"&gt;Brian Eno&lt;/a&gt;. His compositions are a fusion of live instrumentation and electronic production. "
