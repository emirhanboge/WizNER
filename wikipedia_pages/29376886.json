She is excited about the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Meredith%20Grey\"&gt;Dr. Meredith Grey&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ellen%20Pompeo\"&gt;Ellen Pompeo&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Shepherd\"&gt;Dr. Derek Shepherd&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Dempsey\"&gt;Patrick Dempsey&lt;/a&gt;), which she prepared and will take place at the end of the day. Stevens, who has been diagnosed with stage IV metastatic cancer in her brain and liver, has just undergone a surgery to remove a tumor. She however has hallucinations of Denny Duquette (&lt;a href=\"Jeffrey%20Dean%20Morgan\"&gt;Jeffrey Dean Morgan&lt;/a&gt;), her former deceased fianc\u00e9, which she knows means she has another tumor.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Cristina%20Yang\"&gt;Dr. Cristina Yang&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sandra%20Oh\"&gt;Sandra Oh&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Owen%20Hunt\"&gt;Dr. Owen Hunt&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kevin%20McKidd\"&gt;Kevin McKidd&lt;/a&gt;)'s relationship is still strained after Hunt's &lt;a href=\"posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder\"&gt;posttraumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt; (PTSD) caused him to strangle Yang while they were sleeping. &lt;a href=\"Callie%20Torres\"&gt;Dr. Callie Torres&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sara%20Ramirez\"&gt;Sara Ramirez&lt;/a&gt;) who has financial difficulties takes extra shifts. A group of college students who were going to their graduation arrives in the hospital following a car accident. &lt;a href=\"Arizona%20Robbins\"&gt;Dr. Arizona Robbins&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Jessica%20Capshaw\"&gt;Jessica Capshaw&lt;/a&gt;) tries to know what went wrong the previous night during her date with Callie but she avoids the subject.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Miranda%20Bailey\"&gt;Dr. Bailey&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Chandra%20Wilson\"&gt;Chandra Wilson&lt;/a&gt;) and Derek cannot find any tumor in Izzie's brain from the &lt;a href=\"MRI\"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;, they decide to map her brain while she hallucinates and they discover an inoperable tumor. Afterwards, Bailey has an idea and shares it with Derek. Meredith receives her first solo surgery as wedding gift from Derek. The &lt;a href=\"colon%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; surgery is overseen by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Webber\"&gt;Dr. Richard Webber&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"James%20Pickens%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;James Pickens, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;), which turns out to be successful.

The episode concludes with Izzie having shaved her head and telling Denny to leave as she wants to be alone with her husband.\nProduction.\nThe episode, written by &lt;a href=\"Shonda%20Rhimes\"&gt;Shonda Rhimes&lt;/a&gt; and directed by &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Corn\"&gt;Rob Corn&lt;/a&gt;, was filmed in Los Angeles in March 2009. Featured music included &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Mayfield\"&gt;Matthew Mayfield&lt;/a&gt;'s \"First In Line\", &lt;a href=\"Au%20Revoir%20Simone\"&gt;Au Revoir Simone&lt;/a&gt;, \"Another Likely Story\" and &lt;a href=\"Ingrid%20Michaelson\"&gt;Ingrid Michaelson&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Turn To Stone\". Izzie's &lt;a href=\"Amsale%20Aberra\"&gt;Amsale&lt;/a&gt; dress, constituted of a long tulle skirt with an elaborate crystal-embroidered bodice, was designed by Kenneth Pool. The bridesmaids dresses were also from Amsale.\n&lt;a href=\"Jeffrey%20Dean%20Morgan\"&gt;Jeffrey Dean Morgan&lt;/a&gt; returned as Denny Duquette for a final appearance in the series. Rhimes noted that his return, unlike previous ones, were as Death and caused him to wear black clothes and speak sparingly. Rhimes felt that the episode showed well Meredith's evolution throughout the show from a \"dark and twisty girl\" to a \"happy woman\". \"She is the thing her mother wished for her. She is extraordinary. Because, to get past the crap of your past? To move on? To let the past go and change? That is extraordinary. To love? Without fear? Without screwing it up? That is extraordinary. It makes me happy to see her happy.\" Rhimes said that Karev also had grown up, which was noticeable in this episode: \"Look at him. Standing at the altar and saying those vows like a man. (...) He's become a man who can step up. And I love him for it.\"\nTo promote the episode, a special website for Meredith and Derek's wedding was created, supposedly created and updated by Izzie. The website provided details on the event and an invitation to RSVP. Rhimes wanted it to \"feel like a real wedding website\", even though it was for fictional characters. She had the idea during the shooting.\nReception.\n\"What a Difference a Day Makes\" was originally broadcast on May 7, 2009 in the United States on the &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;American Broadcasting Company&lt;/a&gt; (ABC). The episode was watched by a total of 15.326 million people, a slight increase from the previous episode \"No Good at Saying Sorry\", which garnered 13.485 million viewers. In terms of viewership, the episode ranked #1 in its time-slot, beating out &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;'s \"\". \"What a Difference a Day Makes\" scored a 5.3/14 &lt;a href=\"Nielsen%20ratings%23Ratings/share%20and%20total%20viewers\"&gt;Nielsen rating/share&lt;/a&gt; in the adults among the &lt;a href=\"Nielsen%20ratings%23Demographics\"&gt;18\u201349 demographic&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alan%20Sepinwall\"&gt;Alan Sepinwall&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Star-Ledger\"&gt;Star-Ledger&lt;/a&gt;\" gave a positive review of the episode: \"For an episode that was so Izzie-centric, 'What a Difference a Day Makes' worked surprisingly well for me.\" Even though he pointed out Chandra Wilson as \"the best actor in the ensemble, Sepinwall liked Justin Chambers' acting, \"because of how far Karev has come, Chambers' big moments always feel more surprising, and powerful.\" He also appreciated \"all the action in the pit.\" \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\" listed Alex's speech to Izzie in their \"25 Great 'I Love You's\". The \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Times\"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;\" writer Shawna Malcolm wasn't shocked that Izzie and Alex married instead of Meredith and Derek as she had already elaborated that hypothesis weeks prior to the episode's broadcast. She underlined Heigl and Chambers' performances, saying: \"it was next to impossible not to get swept up in the moment, what with Katherine Heigl and Justin Chambers getting all teary and acting the hell out of the thing.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Zap2it\"&gt;Zap2it&lt;/a&gt;\"'s Lisa Todorovich wrote: \"Oh, Shonda Rhimes, you minx! You get us all excited for the long-awaited marital-union between Meredith and Derek, and you pull a great big bait-and-switch with Izzie and Alex. Congratulations on the very nice-looking bridesmaids' dresses.\" She described the wedding as \"great\" and George brilliant for helping Izzie walk down the aisle. She also praised Callie \"who handled the ER like a champ\". Todorovich's colleague Ghosh Korbi suspected a week before the episode aired that it would center on Izzie and Alex.\" Dustin Christian of \"CinemaBlend\" said the wedding was \"actually much better than the wedding we were led to expect.\" However, he thought that everything happening before the last 15 minutes was not interesting. Though he likes Callie and Arizona as a couple, he deemed their storyline \"ridiculous\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"PopSugar\"&gt;BuzzSugar&lt;/a&gt;\" summarized the episode as one that \"has all the elements of a classic.\" The reviewer wrote that the wedding made him cry \"despite lots of lapses logic. It's not my favorite \"Grey's\" of the season, but if a measure of a good episode is whether I was a weepy mess by the end, then \"What a Difference a Day Makes\" is certainly good.\" He shared Malcolm's point of view that Izzie/Alex wedding twist was not surprising and concerning other minor plotlines, he called Arizona a \"pest\". Izzie was featured in \"&lt;a href=\"InStyle\"&gt;InStyle&lt;/a&gt;\" Most Memorable TV Brides. Meeta Agrawal of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said \"while Izzie's trip down the aisle was the stuff of fairy-tales, her Amsale gown \u2014 with its unflattering drop waist and glitter-pen doodling \u2014 didn't quite live up to the fantasy\"."
