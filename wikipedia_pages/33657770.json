    "text": "Federico Colombo (born 6 December 1987) is an Italian professional &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt;er who plays on the &lt;a href=\"European%20Tour\"&gt;European Tour&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nColombo won several junior amateur events in his home country, before taking up a golf scholarship to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Arkansas\"&gt;University of Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. He spent a year in Arkansas, but turned professional in late 2008 having reached the final stage of &lt;a href=\"qualifying%20school\"&gt;qualifying school&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"European%20Tour\"&gt;European Tour&lt;/a&gt;. Playing the final stage as his first professional tournament, Colombo finished T29th and earned a place on the &lt;a href=\"European%20Tour\"&gt;European Tour&lt;/a&gt; for 2009. After a slow start, making only one cut, Colombo concentrated on the second-tier &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Tour\"&gt;Challenge Tour&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently played full-time at that level for two further seasons, with a best result of T2nd in the 2010 &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan%20Open\"&gt;Kazakhstan Open&lt;/a&gt;. In 2011, he recorded eight top ten finishes in 20 events to finish seventh in the rankings and secure a return to the European Tour.\nTeam appearances.\nAmateur"
