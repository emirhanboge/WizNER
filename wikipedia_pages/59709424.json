    "title": "Nebelkerzenabwurfvorrichtung",
    "text": "The Nebelkerzenabwurfvorrichtung (abbreviated N.K.A.V.) was a rear mounted &lt;a href=\"grenade\"&gt;grenade&lt;/a&gt; dispenser used to disperse the Schnellnebelkerze 39 &lt;a href=\"smoke%20grenade\"&gt;smoke grenade&lt;/a&gt;. It was typically found on &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tanks%20in%20the%20German%20Army\"&gt;tanks&lt;/a&gt; from 1939 through 1942.\nOperation.\nThe device carried five smoke grenades, each grenade being held in position by &lt;a href=\"spring%20%28device%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; loaded &lt;a href=\"latch%20%28hardware%29\"&gt;catches&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle &lt;a href=\"Tank%23Crew\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; released the grenades one at a time by wire control which operated a &lt;a href=\"ratchet%20%28device%29\"&gt;ratchet&lt;/a&gt; coupled to a &lt;a href=\"camshaft\"&gt;camshaft&lt;/a&gt;. \nEach pull of the control wire &lt;a href=\"rotation\"&gt;rotated&lt;/a&gt; the camshaft one fifth of a turn, releasing a smoke grenade, the pin of which was drawn out by a fixed &lt;a href=\"chain\"&gt;chain&lt;/a&gt;, and the ratchet was returned to its original position by a second spring. Five pulls on the control wire would release all five smoke grenades in succession, enabling the vehicle to reverse out of sight into its own &lt;a href=\"smoke%20screen\"&gt;smoke screen&lt;/a&gt; with the grenades discharging smoke for about 100 to 200 &lt;a href=\"second\"&gt;second&lt;/a&gt;s. Later examples of the \"Nebelkerzenabwurfvorrichtung\" were fully enclosed in an &lt;a href=\"armour\"&gt;armored&lt;/a&gt; box (\"N.K.A.V. mit Schutzmantel\"). The \"Nebelkerzenabwurfvorrichtung\" was discontinued beginning in April 1942 because it had not proven to be effective, the main disadvantage being that the resulting smoke screen built up behind the vehicle. It was succeeded by the &lt;a href=\"gun%20turret\"&gt;turret&lt;/a&gt; mounted \"&lt;a href=\"Nebelwurfger%C3%A4t\"&gt;Nebelwurfger\u00e4t&lt;/a&gt;\" launcher."
