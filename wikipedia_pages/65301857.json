    "text": "Reinhard Wenskus (10 March 1916 \u2013 5 July 2002) was a German historian who was Professor of Medieval History at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen\"&gt;University of G\u00f6ttingen&lt;/a&gt;. His theories on the identity of &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20peoples\"&gt;Germanic peoples&lt;/a&gt; have had a major influence on contemporary research by historians of &lt;a href=\"late%20antiquity\"&gt;late antiquity&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nReinhard Wenskus was born in , &lt;a href=\"East%20Prussia\"&gt;East Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, Germany on 10 March 1916. After graduating from high school in &lt;a href=\"Sovetsk%2C%20Kaliningrad%20Oblast\"&gt;Tilsit&lt;/a&gt;, East Prussia, Wenskus began working as a commercial apprentice there. He served as a soldier in the &lt;a href=\"German%20Army%20%281935%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;German Army&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, Wenskus gained his &lt;a href=\"abitur\"&gt;abitur&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hanover\"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently studied history, &lt;a href=\"ethnology\"&gt;ethnology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germanistics\"&gt;Germanistics&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Marburg\"&gt;University of Marburg&lt;/a&gt;. He received his &lt;a href=\"PhD\"&gt;PhD&lt;/a&gt; in 1954 under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Helmut%20Beumann\"&gt;Helmut Beumann&lt;/a&gt;. Wenskus subsequently worked as a research assistant, and gained his &lt;a href=\"habilitation\"&gt;habilitation&lt;/a&gt; at Marburg in 1959 with the thesis \"Stammesbildung und Verfassung\". He was subsequently appointed &lt;a href=\"Docent\"&gt;Docent&lt;/a&gt; at Marburg.\nIn 1963, Wenskus succeeded &lt;a href=\"Percy%20Ernst%20Schramm\"&gt;Percy Ernst Schramm&lt;/a&gt; as Professor of Medieval History at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen\"&gt;University of G\u00f6ttingen&lt;/a&gt;. He became a Member of the &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6ttingen%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20and%20Humanities\"&gt;G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities&lt;/a&gt; in 1969. Wenskus retired from G\u00f6ttingen in 1981, but continued to teach and research. He died in G\u00f6ttingen on 5 July 2002.\nResearch.\nWenskus specialized in medieval history, particularly that of &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Teutonic%20Order\"&gt;Teutonic Order&lt;/a&gt;, and the history, &lt;a href=\"historiography\"&gt;historiography&lt;/a&gt; and constitution of medieval &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20peoples\"&gt;Germanic peoples&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout his career, Wenskus was distinguished by his emphasis on interdisciplinary research. In addition to being a historian by profession, Wenskus was highly learned in linguistics, archaeology and ethnology, and sought to use evidence from these disciplines as a way to get a better understanding of history. Along with &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Jankuhn\"&gt;Herbert Jankuhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Ranke\"&gt;Kurt Ranke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Kuhn%20%28philologist%29\"&gt;Hans Kuhn&lt;/a&gt; and Schramm, Wenskus was a co-founder of the second edition of the \"&lt;a href=\"Reallexikon%20der%20Germanischen%20Altertumskunde\"&gt;Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde&lt;/a&gt;\", to which he contributed a large number of articles.\nIn his \"Stammesbildung und Verfassung\" (1961), Wenskus argued that Germanic peoples were not organized upon biological &lt;a href=\"kinship\"&gt;kinship&lt;/a&gt;, but instead based their identity upon being led by small warrior elite who maintained the core tradition () of the tribe. He also theorized that the \"&lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;\" peoples of the &lt;a href=\"Migration%20Period\"&gt;Migration Period&lt;/a&gt; maintained ethnic identities distinguishing them from the &lt;a href=\"Romance%20peoples\"&gt;Romance peoples&lt;/a&gt;, and referred to this ideology of \"barbarian\" ethnic identity as \"Gentilismus\". Wenskus' ideas have been highly influential on modern understanding on \"barbarian\" identity. It contributed to the development of the &lt;a href=\"ethnogenesis\"&gt;ethnogenesis&lt;/a&gt; concept, and the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Vienna%20School%20of%20History\"&gt;Vienna School of History&lt;/a&gt;."
