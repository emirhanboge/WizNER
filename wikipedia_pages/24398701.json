    "text": "The Choptank (or Ababco) were an &lt;a href=\"Algonquian%20languages\"&gt;Algonquian&lt;/a&gt;-speaking &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; people that historically lived on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Shore%20of%20Maryland\"&gt;Eastern Shore of Maryland&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Delmarva%20Peninsula\"&gt;Delmarva Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. They occupied an area along the lower &lt;a href=\"Choptank%20River\"&gt;Choptank River&lt;/a&gt; basin, which included parts of present-day &lt;a href=\"Talbot%20County%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Talbot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dorchester%20County%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Dorchester&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20County%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Caroline&lt;/a&gt; counties. They spoke &lt;a href=\"Nanticoke%20language\"&gt;Nanticoke&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Algonquian%20languages\"&gt;Eastern Algonquian language&lt;/a&gt; closely related to &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20languages\"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;. The Choptank were the only Indians on the Eastern Shore to be granted a reservation in fee simple by the &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; colonial government. They retained the land until 1822, when the state of Maryland sold it, in part to pay for the state's share of the &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe name Choptank is thought to be from the Nanticoke word \"tshapetank:\" a stream that separates, or place of big current.\nThe Algonquian-speaking Choptank were independent, but they were related in culture and language to the &lt;a href=\"Nanticoke%20people\"&gt;Nanticoke&lt;/a&gt;, the larger &lt;a href=\"paramount%20chief\"&gt;paramount&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chiefdom\"&gt;chiefdom&lt;/a&gt; immediately to their south, which was dominant on the Eastern Shore. After the arrival of English colonists, the tribes' histories took different paths. The Choptank maintained good relations with the European settlers. Eventually they were &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20assimilation\"&gt;assimilated&lt;/a&gt; into the mainstream society through intermarriage. Like many other small tribes, they ceased to exist as a separate entity, although their descendants survive.\nThe only Indian reservation which the English established in fee simple on the Eastern Shore was the Choptank Indian Reservation in 1669. The territory included what later became the city of &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, the county seat of Dorchester County. The last town in Dorchester County occupied by the Choptank was Locust Neck Indian Town, which they left about 1790. In 1822, the state of Maryland sold the land of the reservation for development. The state used some of the proceeds to pay its share of contribution to the formation of the District of Columbia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;U.S. Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tugboat\"&gt;tugboat&lt;/a&gt; \"Choptank\" was named after the tribe. It served from 1918 until 1946. The towns of &lt;a href=\"Choptank%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Choptank, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, and Choptank Mills, Delaware, are named after the river. Fictional members of the tribe are characters in the early chapters of James Michener's 1978 novel, \"&lt;a href=\"Chesapeake%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Chesapeake&lt;/a&gt;\"."
