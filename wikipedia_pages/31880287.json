    "text": "Europe XI v Africa XI (1997) was a friendly &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; match that took place on 29 January 1997 at the &lt;a href=\"Est%C3%A1dio%20da%20Luz%20%281954%29\"&gt;Est\u00e1dio da Luz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, between a European select side and an African select side. The match was jointly organized by &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20African%20Football\"&gt;CAF&lt;/a&gt; as part of the European Year against Racism. The African XI won 2\u20131 with goals from &lt;a href=\"Abedi%20Pele\"&gt;Abedi Pele&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mustapha%20Hadji\"&gt;Mustapha Hadji&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe European Union's \"Year Against Racism\" started with an exhibition match between All-Star teams representing Europe and Africa. The following day, UEFA, European football's ruling body, and CAF, its African counterpart, held their first joint-executive meeting in Lisbon where they signed a friendship agreement which ended years of barely concealed hostility. The agreement obliged the two confederations to \"undertake extensive co-operation in all football-related matters as partners with equal rights\".\nThe European side, selected by &lt;a href=\"Rinus%20Michels\"&gt;Rinus Michels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Berti%20Vogts\"&gt;Berti Vogts&lt;/a&gt;, had a 17-man squad which contained four players who were among Germany's &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%2096\"&gt;Euro 96&lt;/a&gt; winners, including their captain, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann\"&gt;J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Dutch twin brothers &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20de%20Boer\"&gt;Ronald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frank%20de%20Boer\"&gt;Frank de Boer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zvonimir%20Boban\"&gt;Zvonimir Boban&lt;/a&gt;, Milan's Croat midfielder. While many of the world's top players were involved, there were no English players in the European squad as the Premier League had a packed schedule that night. No players from eastern European clubs were involved either, because of their winter break. The African All-Stars 18-man squad, selected by &lt;a href=\"Rabah%20Madjer\"&gt;Rabah Madjer&lt;/a&gt; and Mawade Wade, included four of Nigeria's Olympic gold-medal winning &lt;a href=\"Football%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics%20-%20Men%27s%20team%20squads%23Nigeria\"&gt;squad&lt;/a&gt; and two of South Africa's African championship winning squad.\nSelecting Benfica's Stadium of Light to host the event was a deliberate choice serving to recognise the enormous contribution that Benfica's greatest player, &lt;a href=\"Eus%C3%A9bio\"&gt;Eus\u00e9bio&lt;/a&gt;, had made to European football. Benfica had players in both squads, with Portugal's &lt;a href=\"Jo%C3%A3o%20Vieira%20Pinto\"&gt;Jo\u00e3o Pinto&lt;/a&gt; in the European camp and &lt;a href=\"Paulo%20Ant%C3%B3nio%20Alves\"&gt;Paulo Ant\u00f3nio&lt;/a&gt; of Angola, in the African. Because the intention was to give everybody a game, both teams were allowed to use two re-substitutions - the sending back on a player previously substituted - in the event of second-half injuries. As a continuing part of the anti-racism initiative, the under-17 &lt;a href=\"UEFA%E2%80%93CAF%20Meridian%20Cup\"&gt;Meridian Cup&lt;/a&gt;, which comprises four nations from each continent, kicked off two days later."
