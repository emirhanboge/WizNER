    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; established diplomatic relations in 1952. Both nations share some cultural similarities. Indonesia and Sri Lanka are members of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Trade%20Organization\"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt;. They are founding members of the &lt;a href=\"Non-Aligned%20Movement\"&gt;Non-Aligned Movement&lt;/a&gt;. Indonesia has an &lt;a href=\"embassy\"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Colombo\"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, while Sri Lanka has an embassy in &lt;a href=\"Jakarta\"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegarding the &lt;a href=\"LTTE\"&gt;LTTE&lt;/a&gt; separatism in Sri Lanka, Indonesia has expressed their support on Sri Lankan territorial integrity and national unity. Indonesia also supports the national reconciliation process in Sri Lanka towards peace and stability.\nHistory.\nThe relationship between the two nations began earlier in 5th century CE, marked by the coming of Hinduism and Buddhism influences from Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka to Indonesian archipelago. The Hindu-Buddhist &lt;a href=\"Monarchy\"&gt;kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; of ancient Indonesia and Sri Lanka nurtured contacts in the 9th to 12th century CE, during the era of the &lt;a href=\"Srivijaya\"&gt;Srivijaya&lt;/a&gt; Empire. During this time, &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; was the principal &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; of both nations. According to the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Indonesia, an Indonesian king visited Sri Lanka presented a baby &lt;a href=\"elephant\"&gt;elephant&lt;/a&gt; as a gift.\nThe interactions between them grew in the 17th and 18th centuries, as both nations fell under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20India%20Company\"&gt;Dutch East India Company&lt;/a&gt; (VOC). Sri Lanka was part of the VOC during &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20period%20in%20Ceylon\"&gt;Dutch period in Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; from 1656 to 1796. In the 17th-century, Indonesia was under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20India%20Company\"&gt;Dutch East India Company&lt;/a&gt; as well as housing the headquarters for the VOC. It later became a &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20colony\"&gt;Dutch colony&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20Indies\"&gt;Dutch East Indies&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. During the 18th century, multiple of kings, princes, and warriors from &lt;a href=\"Javanese%20people\"&gt;Javanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mataram%20Sultanate\"&gt;Mataram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madura\"&gt;Madura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sulawesi\"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt;, who opposed were opposed to Dutch rule of the &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20archipelago\"&gt;Indonesian archipelago&lt;/a&gt; were exiled to Sri Lanka. The descendants of Indonesian exiles have created the Indonesian\u2014Malay community in Sri Lanka that can trace their ancestry to Java, Madura and Sulawesi. For example, a warrior who fought for &lt;a href=\"Kandy%20Kingdom\"&gt;Kandy Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; named Karaeng Sangunglo was a &lt;a href=\"Bugis\"&gt;Bugis&lt;/a&gt; nobleman.\nIndonesia and Sri Lanka officially established diplomatic relations on 2 August 1952. The relations grow further in 1955, when Indonesia and Sri Lanka, together with India, Pakistan and Burma initiated the &lt;a href=\"Bandung%20Conference\"&gt;Bandung Conference&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1962, the status of the Indonesian Consulate office in Colombo has been upgraded as an embassy. The office has also served as the Indonesian representative office for &lt;a href=\"Maldives\"&gt;Maldives&lt;/a&gt; as of 2 September 1975. \nEconomy and trade.\nThe Sri Lanka-Indonesia Business Council was established on August 30, 1991, with the main objective of promoting bilateral &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"investment\"&gt;investment&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"tourism\"&gt;tourism&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 2012, both nations have agreed on increasing bilateral cooperation sectors including &lt;a href=\"defense%20%28military%29\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"culture\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aquaculture\"&gt;aquaculture&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nIn April 2013, Indonesia and Sri Lanka commemorated the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations in &lt;a href=\"Merdeka%20Building\"&gt;Merdeka Building&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bandung\"&gt;Bandung&lt;/a&gt;, to remember &lt;a href=\"Asian%E2%80%93African%20Conference\"&gt;Asian\u2013African Conference&lt;/a&gt;, the historic event that brought two nations closer together. This event is also marked with cultural collaboration of traditional &lt;a href=\"puppet\"&gt;puppet&lt;/a&gt; performance; Indonesian &lt;a href=\"wayang%20golek\"&gt;wayang golek&lt;/a&gt; with Sri Lankan &lt;a href=\"ruukada\"&gt;ruukada&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmbassy.\nThe Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in Colombo () is the diplomatic mission of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;Republic of Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; and is &lt;a href=\"Dual%20accreditation\"&gt;concurrently accredited&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Maldives\"&gt;Republic of Maldives&lt;/a&gt;. The current ambassador, I Gusti Ngurah Ardiyasa, was appointed by &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Joko%20Widodo\"&gt;Joko Widodo&lt;/a&gt; on 13 March 2017."
