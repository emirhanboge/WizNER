    "text": "Bingo is a 1974 French-Canadian thriller directed by &lt;a href=\"Jean-Claude%20Lord\"&gt;Jean-Claude Lord&lt;/a&gt;. The plot relates to Quebec's &lt;a href=\"October%20Crisis\"&gt;October Crisis&lt;/a&gt; of 1970.\nSynopsis.\nDirector &lt;a href=\"Jean-Claude%20Lord\"&gt;Jean-Claude Lord&lt;/a&gt; exploits the post-October Crisis paranoia that was rampant in Quebec with considerable panache with this skilful melodrama. Although the story is not about the events leading up to the &lt;a href=\"War%20Measures%20Act\"&gt;War Measures Act&lt;/a&gt;, it does draw upon the fabric and feelings of that time. A young photographer (&lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9jean%20Gu%C3%A9nette\"&gt;R\u00e9jean Gu\u00e9nette&lt;/a&gt;) becomes unwittingly entangled in a terrorist organization, which engages in a plot against prominent politicians and business leaders before an upcoming election. The film was hugely popular in Quebec and established Lord as a major director with this, his third feature.\nSoundtrack.\nLord's wife, and co-screenwriter, the actress &lt;a href=\"Lise%20Thouin\"&gt;Lise Thouin&lt;/a&gt; released \"Bingo\", written by &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Conte\"&gt;Michel Conte&lt;/a&gt; as a single.\nReception.\nThe film was well received in &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; but failed to find an audience elsewhere, grossing $1.5 million in Canada."
