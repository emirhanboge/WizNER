    "text": "Mercer 3, also known as GLIMPSE-C02, is a heavily obscured &lt;a href=\"globular%20cluster\"&gt;globular cluster&lt;/a&gt; embedded in the disk of the &lt;a href=\"Milky%20Way\"&gt;Milky Way&lt;/a&gt; galaxy. It was discovered in 2008 in the data obtained by &lt;a href=\"2MASS\"&gt;2MASS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spitzer%20Space%20Telescope\"&gt;GLIMPSE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"infrared\"&gt;infrared&lt;/a&gt; surveys, and independently characterized by two groups. The cluster is located in the &lt;a href=\"Scutum%20%28constellation%29\"&gt;Scutum&lt;/a&gt; constellation. It had avoided detection for such a long time due to the extremely strong foreground &lt;a href=\"extinction%20%28astronomy%29\"&gt;extinction&lt;/a&gt; in its direction reaching 24 magnitudes in the visible light. Mercer 3 is probably situated at the distance from 4 to 8\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Parsec%23Parsecs%20and%20kiloparsecs\"&gt;kpc&lt;/a&gt; from the Sun and has a half-light radius of 0.7\u20131.5\u00a0pc.\nMercer 3 is an old globular cluster having the age of about 12 billion years. The mass of cluster is estimated at 2\u20133 hundred thousand &lt;a href=\"solar%20mass\"&gt;solar mass&lt;/a&gt;es. It is among the most &lt;a href=\"metallicity\"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt;-rich galactic globular clusters known."
