    "text": "The Grey is an &lt;a href=\"Cuisine%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cuisine%20of%20the%20Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southern&lt;/a&gt; restaurant in &lt;a href=\"Savannah%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Savannah, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, United States. It is co-owned by John O. Morisano and &lt;a href=\"Mashama%20Bailey\"&gt;Mashama Bailey&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of whom also serves as head chef. \nHistory.\nBased in New York City, John O. Morisano moved to Savannah, Georgia, part time. While there, he bought a former &lt;a href=\"Greyhound%20bus\"&gt;Greyhound bus&lt;/a&gt; depot in downtown Savannah, which he had toured in March 2012. He bought the building in March 2013 for $945,000. The depot closed in 1964. When it was operating, the depot was &lt;a href=\"Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;racially segregated&lt;/a&gt; with separate waiting areas and restrooms for blacks and whites. Morisano planned to open a restaurant in the depot and was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Mashama%20Bailey\"&gt;Mashama Bailey&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Hamilton%20%28chef%29\"&gt;Gabrielle Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, Bailey was a &lt;a href=\"sous%20chef\"&gt;sous chef&lt;/a&gt; at Hamilton's New York restaurant, Prune.\nDesign and ambiance.\nThe Grey is located inside a former Greyhound bus depot in downtown Savannah. Morisano invested millions of dollars to make the restaurant &lt;a href=\"Streamline%20Moderne\"&gt;Streamline Moderne&lt;/a&gt; in style and design. Parts and Labor designed the interior and Felder &amp; Associates were the architecture firm. The depot's former diner became the Grey's dining room. Curved booths are blue, representing the Greyhound bus logo. The bar is horseshoe shaped. There are numbers painted on the walls representing the station's former boarding gates. The kitchen is the former ticket booth. The \"&lt;a href=\"Savannah%20Morning%20News\"&gt;Savannah Morning News&lt;/a&gt;\"' Julia Ritchey described the look as similar to &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Hopper\"&gt;Edward Hopper&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Nighthawks%20%28painting%29\"&gt;Nighthawks&lt;/a&gt;\".\nArtwork in the restaurant includes works Adam Keuhl, Marcus Kenney, Betsy Cain, and a photograph of &lt;a href=\"James%20Cleveland\"&gt;James Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; performing at the First African Baptist Church in Savannah by photographer James Cleveland.\nCuisine and beverages.\nWhen the restaurant first opened, Bailey called the cuisine \"port city Southern food.\" Today, the restaurant remains primarily &lt;a href=\"Cuisine%20of%20the%20Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southern&lt;/a&gt; in style with &lt;a href=\"African%20cuisine\"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; influences. African influences include the use of Kanni sauce from &lt;a href=\"Senegal\"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"harissa\"&gt;harissa&lt;/a&gt;. Bailey also pulls influence from European cuisine, including in one of her signature dishes: &lt;a href=\"foie%20gras\"&gt;foie gras&lt;/a&gt; and grits. To find inspiration for the menu, Bailey read books by &lt;a href=\"Edna%20Lewis\"&gt;Edna Lewis&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, Bailey designed the entire menu around different chapters of Lewis' \"In Pursuit of Flavor\". \nThe menu changes regularly. Appetizers may include oysters, &lt;a href=\"benne\"&gt;benne&lt;/a&gt; seed crackers and chutney, and watermelon salad. Main dishes may include &lt;a href=\"Country%20Captain\"&gt;Country Captain&lt;/a&gt;. Side dishes are offered, including smoked &lt;a href=\"Leaf%20vegetable\"&gt;greens&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe restaurant has a full bar, with cocktails including &lt;a href=\"Gimlet%20%28cocktail%29\"&gt;gimlet&lt;/a&gt;s.\nReception.\nIn 2015, &lt;a href=\"Ingrid%20K.%20Williams\"&gt;Ingrid K. Williams&lt;/a&gt; visited the restaurant on behalf of the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\". Williams praised the decor, a pork shank prepared with cane sugar, greens and cornbread, and the desserts. However, in the same review she said the restaurant was still \"ironing out kinks\" citing an overcooked roasted sea bass. That same year it was nominated for a &lt;a href=\"James%20Beard%20Award\"&gt;James Beard Award&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2017, The Grey was named \"&lt;a href=\"Eater%20%28website%29\"&gt;Eater&lt;/a&gt;'s\" 2017 Restaurant of the Year. The following year, The Grey was named one of \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;'s\" Greatest Places. "
