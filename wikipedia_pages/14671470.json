    "text": "Beaulieu International Group is a &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"textile\"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt; manufacturing company, with its head office located in &lt;a href=\"Waregem\"&gt;Waregem&lt;/a&gt;, a region of &lt;a href=\"West%20Flanders\"&gt;West Flanders&lt;/a&gt; which is known for its textile industry.\nHistory.\nThe company was founded as \"Beaulieu\" in 1959 by &lt;a href=\"Roger%20De%20Clerck\"&gt;Roger De Clerck&lt;/a&gt; as a fabric production business. Between 1959 and 1991 Beaulieu expanded and grew into a vertical integrated company. In 1991 the company was split-up in seven parts between Roger De Clerck and his six children. Roger De Clerck remained in charge of raw materials. Between 1991 and 2005 the changing market conditions led to an overcapacity in the European textile industry and growing international competition. Finally in 2005 five of the seven branches of the Beaulieu Group merged and became the Beaulieu International Group.\nIn 1978 the American offshoot, \"Beaulieu of America\", was created by Roger De Clerck's son-in-law &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Bouckaert\"&gt;Carl Bouckaert&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Mieke De Clerck. Beaulieu of America declared bankruptcy on July 17, 2017 and, after the company's reorganization efforts failed, Beaulieu of America's assets were acquired by &lt;a href=\"Engineered%20Floors\"&gt;Engineered Floors&lt;/a&gt; in a deal announced on September 20, 2017."
