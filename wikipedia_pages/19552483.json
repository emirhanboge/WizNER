    "text": "SM \"U-12 or U-XII\" was a or &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; built for and operated by the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Navy\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Navy&lt;/a&gt; before and during the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuilt on speculation by &lt;a href=\"Whitehead%20%26amp%3B%20Co.\"&gt;Whitehead &amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Fiume\"&gt;Fiume&lt;/a&gt;, the submarine was &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; as SS-3 in March 1911 and featured improvements in the electrical and mechanical systems from the design by the American &lt;a href=\"John%20Philip%20Holland\"&gt;John Philip Holland&lt;/a&gt;, to which her older &lt;a href=\"Sister%20ship\"&gt;sister boats&lt;/a&gt;, and , had been built.\n\"SS-3\" was &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; in 1909. The double-&lt;a href=\"submarine%20hull\"&gt;hulled&lt;/a&gt; submarine was just over long and &lt;a href=\"displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. Whitehead tried selling \"SS-3\" to several different navies, but she was bought by the Austro-Hungarian Navy after the outbreak of World War I, despite having been rejected by them twice before. She was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; as \"U-12\" in August 1914.\nThe submarine sank only one ship, a Greek &lt;a href=\"cargo%20ship\"&gt;cargo ship&lt;/a&gt; in May 1915, but she had earlier captured six &lt;a href=\"Montenegro\"&gt;Montenegrin&lt;/a&gt; sailing vessels as &lt;a href=\"prize%20%28law%29\"&gt;prizes&lt;/a&gt; in March. \"U-12\" also damaged, but did not sink, the French battleship in December 1914. While searching for targets in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; in August 1915, \"U-12\" struck a mine that blew her stern off, and sank with all hands, becoming the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk in the war. Her wreck was salvaged the next year by the Italians, who interred \"U-12\"s crewmen in a Venetian cemetery.\nDesign and construction.\n\"SS-3\" was built on speculation by Whitehead &amp; Co. of &lt;a href=\"Fiume\"&gt;Fiume&lt;/a&gt;. Her design was based on the &lt;a href=\"John%20Philip%20Holland\"&gt;John Philip Holland&lt;/a&gt; design licensed by Whitehead for and , two submarines ordered by the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Navy\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Navy&lt;/a&gt; and built 1907\u20131910, and featured improvements in the mechanical and electrical systems. \"SS-3\" was &lt;a href=\"Keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; in 1909 and &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; at Fiume on 14 March 1911.\n\"SS-3\"s featured a single-&lt;a href=\"hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; with a tear-drop shaped body that bore a strong resemblance to modern &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20submarine\"&gt;nuclear submarine&lt;/a&gt;s. She was long by &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28ship%29\"&gt;abeam&lt;/a&gt; and had a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28ship%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . She &lt;a href=\"displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; surfaced, and submerged. Her two bow &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s featured unique, &lt;a href=\"clover\"&gt;clover&lt;/a&gt;leaf-shaped design &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;hatches&lt;/a&gt; that rotated on a central axis, and the boat was designed to carry up to four &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es.\nAccording to one source, \"SS-3\" was initially propelled by a pair of &lt;a href=\"electric%20motor\"&gt;electric motor&lt;/a&gt;s for surface running, but had them replaced with twin 6-cylinder &lt;a href=\"gasoline%20engine\"&gt;gasoline engine&lt;/a&gt;s of each when they proved disappointing during trials. It is not specifically reported for \"U-12\", but the other &lt;a href=\"U-5-class%20submarine%20%28Austria-Hungary%29\"&gt;\"U-5\"-class boats&lt;/a&gt; both suffered from inadequate ventilation, which resulted in frequent intoxication of the crew from the engine exhaust. \"SS-3\"s underwater propulsion was by two electric motors that totaled .\nCareer.\nAfter \"SS-3\"s March 1911 launch, Whitehead tried to sell \"SS-3\" to the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but because the evaluation of the first two \"U-5\"-class boats was still underway, they declined to purchase. Over the next three years Whitehead attempted to sell the boat to the navies of Peru, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Bulgaria, before the Austro-Hungarian Navy rejected an offer for the second time. With the outbreak of war, however, the Austro-Hungarian Navy purchased the unsold submarine to quickly bolster its fleet.\nAlthough provisionally assigned the designation \"U-7\", the submarine was commissioned as SM \"U-12\" on 21 August 1914, with \"&lt;a href=\"Linienschiffsleutnant\"&gt;Linienschiffsleutnant&lt;/a&gt;\" Egon Lerch in command. \"U-12\"s activities over the early part of the war are not reported, but the boat's armament was augmented by a /23 &lt;a href=\"quick-firing%20gun\"&gt;quick-firing&lt;/a&gt; (QF) &lt;a href=\"deck%20gun\"&gt;deck gun&lt;/a&gt; in November 1914. Sister boat \"U-5\" had her first radio receiver installed at the same time her deck gun was added, but it is not reported whether \"U-12\" did as well.\nOn 21 December 1914, Lerch and \"U-12\" chanced upon the French &lt;a href=\"dreadnought\"&gt;dreadnought&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Straits%20of%20Otranto\"&gt;Straits of Otranto&lt;/a&gt; steaming at a leisurely and unprotected by escort ships. \"U-12\" hit French &lt;a href=\"Augustin%20Bou%C3%A9%20de%20Lapeyr%C3%A8re\"&gt;Admiral Lapeyr\u00e8re's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt; with a single torpedo in the bow, destroying the battleship's wine storeroom but sparing her forward &lt;a href=\"Magazine%20%28artillery%29%23Naval%20magazines\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt;. \"Jean Bart\"s watertight compartments saved the ship, which made her way to &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; to undergo repairs at the British dockyards there.\n\"U-12\" survived an attack from an unknown French on 27 February 1915. \"U-12\"s next success was the capture of two &lt;a href=\"Montenegro\"&gt;Montenegrin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"schooner\"&gt;schooner&lt;/a&gt;s on 22 March 1916, \"Fiore Di Dulcigno\" and \"Hilussie\". Nine days later the U-boat captured another four Montenegrin boats, \"Buona Forte\", \"Fiore I\", \"Hailie\", and \"Indaverdi\". On 29 May, she sank the Greek steamer \"Virginia\", which was the only ship reported sunk by \"U-12\". In June, \"U-12\" underwent a refit that added an additional two torpedo tubes on her forward &lt;a href=\"casing%20%28submarine%29\"&gt;casing&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn early August, Lerch and \"U-12\" set out from &lt;a href=\"Pula\"&gt;Pola&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; to look for enemy ships to sink. On 6 August, the Italian destroyer rammed \"U-12\", probably by chance, at about 05:00 in the Lido inlet of the &lt;a href=\"Venetian%20Lagoon\"&gt;Venetian Lagoon&lt;/a&gt;. Two days later, when Italian workers were &lt;a href=\"dredge\"&gt;dredging&lt;/a&gt; to try to determine the object \"Rosolino Pilo\" had hit, they heard a heavy explosion. When divers went down in the area, they discovered the wreck of \"U-12\" with her stern blown off. \"U-12\"s entire complement of 17 men was lost when she went down. \"U-12\" was the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk during the war.\nIn late 1916, the Italians salvaged the hulk of \"U-12\" and transported it to Venice. The bodies of \"U-12\"s crew were interred at the San Michele cemetery in Venice, and \"U-12\"s hulk, of no salvage value, was scrapped at the Venice naval arsenal. In her military service, \"U-12\" sank one ship of , damaged one warship (22,189 tons), and captured six ships as prizes."
