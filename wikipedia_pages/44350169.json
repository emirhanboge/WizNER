    "text": "Ezekiel Elijah Elliott (born July 22, 1995) is an &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"running%20back\"&gt;running back&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Cowboys\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; (NFL). He played &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football\"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt;, where he earned second-team &lt;a href=\"All-America\"&gt;All-America&lt;/a&gt; honors in 2015. Elliott was drafted by the Cowboys fourth overall in the &lt;a href=\"2016%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2016 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;. As a three-time &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt; and two-time All-Pro selection, he led the league in rushing yards in 2016 and 2018.\nEarly life.\nElliott was born in &lt;a href=\"Alton%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Alton, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, to a mother and father who were both athletes in college. His mother, the former Dawn Huff, was a high school state champion in three sports before attending the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Missouri\"&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and running track there. His father, Stacy, was a linebacker for the &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;Missouri football team&lt;/a&gt; and CEO of Fifth Down Enterprises. Elliott's maternal grandfather played basketball for &lt;a href=\"Drake%20University\"&gt;Drake University&lt;/a&gt;. His uncle is Finnish professional basketball player &lt;a href=\"Shawn%20Huff\"&gt;Shawn Huff&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh school career.\nDespite his athletic pedigree, Elliott attended more academically driven &lt;a href=\"John%20Burroughs%20School\"&gt;John Burroughs School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ladue%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Ladue, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a three-sport star in football, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, and track, and also played baseball. He played as a &lt;a href=\"running%20back\"&gt;running back&lt;/a&gt; for the John Burroughs Bombers &lt;a href=\"high%20school%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team. As a junior in 2012, he was named the \"&lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Post-Dispatch\"&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/a&gt;\" offensive player of the year after rushing for 1,802 yards and 34 touchdowns and receiving 23 passes for 401 yards and six scores. In his senior year, he had 3,061 &lt;a href=\"all-purpose%20yards\"&gt;all-purpose yards&lt;/a&gt; and 50 total &lt;a href=\"touchdowns\"&gt;touchdowns&lt;/a&gt;, including 2,155 rushing yards and 40 rushing touchdowns. He led the football team to three straight championship games, but lost all three.\nAlso a standout &lt;a href=\"track%20and%20field\"&gt;track and field&lt;/a&gt; athlete, Elliott was a state qualifier in sprinting and hurdling events. He capped his high school career by winning four state championships at the Missouri Class 3 state championships in hours (100-meter dash, 200-meter dash, 110-meter high hurdles and 300-meter hurdles). He recorded career-best times of 10.95 seconds in the &lt;a href=\"100-meter%20dash\"&gt;100-meter dash&lt;/a&gt;, 22.05 seconds in the &lt;a href=\"200-meter%20dash\"&gt;200-meter dash&lt;/a&gt;, 13.77 seconds in the &lt;a href=\"110-meter%20hurdles\"&gt;110m hurdles&lt;/a&gt; and 37.52 seconds in the &lt;a href=\"hurdling\"&gt;300m hurdles&lt;/a&gt;. He was named the Gatorade Track Athlete of the Year in the state of &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsidered a four-star recruit by &lt;a href=\"Scout.com\"&gt;Scout.com&lt;/a&gt;, Elliott was listed as the No. 9 running back in the nation in 2013. He played in the 2013 &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Army%20All-American%20Bowl\"&gt;U.S. Army All-American Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Despite overwhelming support and pressure for Elliott to sign with his parents' alma mater, the &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20Tigers%20football\"&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, he decided to sign with &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20University\"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollege career.\nAs a true freshman at &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football\"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, Elliott rushed for 262 yards on 30 carries with two touchdowns as a backup to starter &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Hyde\"&gt;Carlos Hyde&lt;/a&gt;, mostly playing as a &lt;a href=\"Gunner%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;gunner&lt;/a&gt; on special teams.\nIn 2014, with the departure of Hyde to the NFL, Elliott took over as the starter for the Buckeyes. During the season, Elliott was named to the Academic All-Big Ten Conference team. Elliott rushed over 100 yards six times during the scheduled season. In the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Big%20Ten%20Football%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;2014 Big Ten Championship Game&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Wisconsin%20Badgers%20football%20team\"&gt;Wisconsin Badgers&lt;/a&gt;, Elliott ran for 220 yards on 20 carries for two touchdowns. This win qualified Ohio State for the first-ever &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Playoff\"&gt;College Football Playoff&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;2015 Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt; against #1 &lt;a href=\"2014%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, Elliott ran for 230 yards on 20 carries in a hard-fought 42\u201335 win where he was named the Offensive Player of the Game. He then capped the Buckeyes' championship season by rushing for 246 yards on 36 carries and scoring four touchdowns against the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Oregon%20Ducks%20football%20team\"&gt;Oregon Ducks&lt;/a&gt;. He was named the Offensive MVP of that game as well; it was the third most rushing yards ever by an Ohio State player.\nIn 2015, Elliott began the season by rushing for over 100 yards in 10 straight wins, including 274 against &lt;a href=\"2015%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20football%20team\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; on October 3 (the second most all-time by an Ohio State player). However, the team suffered a 14\u201317 loss to &lt;a href=\"2015%20Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20football%20team\"&gt;Michigan State&lt;/a&gt; on November 21, 2015, and Elliott announced that he would enter the &lt;a href=\"2016%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2016 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;. The following week, Elliott ran for 214 yards on 30 carries in a 42\u201313 Ohio State victory over rival &lt;a href=\"2015%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; in Ann Arbor, his fifth 200+ yard game. He ended his collegiate career with 149 yards and four touchdowns in a &lt;a href=\"2016%20Fiesta%20Bowl%20%28January%29\"&gt;Fiesta Bowl&lt;/a&gt; win over &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20Football\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;.\nElliott finished his career at Ohio State on several leaderboards. He was second in career rushing yards with 3,961 and yards per game with 101.6 (both behind only &lt;a href=\"Archie%20Griffin\"&gt;Archie Griffin&lt;/a&gt;), had the second and third most rushing yards in a season, and five of the top 20 rushing yards in a game. His 43 rushing touchdowns was fourth most all time, and his 23 in 2015 was third most in a season. His twelve 100-yard rushing games in the 2015 season tied &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20George\"&gt;Eddie George&lt;/a&gt; for a school record, and the 22 he amassed over his career was again second only to Griffin (as was his streak of 15 consecutive 100-yard games from 2014 to 2015). He and George are the only Ohio State players with five 200-yard rushing games.\nIndividual awards.\nElliott received numerous honors during his tenure at Ohio State. In the 2014 season, Elliott was named the Offensive MVP of both the 2015 Sugar Bowl and the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship Game.\nElliott's success at the end of the 2014 season made him a front-runner for the 2015 &lt;a href=\"Heisman%20Trophy\"&gt;Heisman Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, though he in fact finished 8th in the voting. After a successful regular season in which he gained 1,672 yards and 19 touchdowns, Elliott was named the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference%20football%20individual%20awards\"&gt;2015 Graham-George Offensive Player of the Year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference%20football%20individual%20awards\"&gt;2015 Ameche-Dayne Running Back of the Year&lt;/a&gt; and was selected as &lt;a href=\"2015%20Big%20Ten%20Conference%20football%20season\"&gt;Unanimous First Team All-Big Ten&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the yearly awards, he was also named Big Ten Player of the Week twice during the 2015 season for his performances in Week 5 against Indiana, and in Week 13 against Michigan.\nProfessional career.\nBefore the draft, Elliott was labeled the most complete back to enter the NFL since &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Peterson\"&gt;Adrian Peterson&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, and was predicted to be a top 10 selection. On a draft breakdown by &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;NFL.com&lt;/a&gt;, he drew comparisons to &lt;a href=\"Edgerrin%20James\"&gt;Edgerrin James&lt;/a&gt; and was listed as a three-down back that had \"rare combination of size, athleticism, pass-catching and blocking skills\", and that he \"should still come out of the gates as one of the most productive young running backs in the league\".\nElliott was selected in the first round with the fourth overall pick by the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Cowboys\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2016%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2016 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; on April 28, 2016. He was the first running back selected in the draft that year. Elliott was widely regarded as an early favorite for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award%23Associated%20Press%20NFL%20ROTY%20Award\"&gt;2016 Offensive Rookie of the Year&lt;/a&gt; while playing behind what many agreed upon as the NFL's most dominant offensive line leading up to the &lt;a href=\"2016%20NFL%20season\"&gt;2016 NFL season&lt;/a&gt;.\n2016 season: Rookie year.\nOn May 18, 2016, Elliott signed his four-year rookie contract reportedly worth $24.9 million with a $16.3 million signing bonus.\nElliott was named the Cowboys' starting running back going into the regular season, ahead of veterans &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Morris%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Alfred Morris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darren%20McFadden\"&gt;Darren McFadden&lt;/a&gt;. In the season-opener against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20New%20York%20Giants%20season\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;, he rushed for 51 yards on 20 attempts and scored his first NFL touchdown on an eight-yard run in the narrow 20\u201319 loss. In the next game against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Washington%20Redskins%20season\"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt;, Elliott had 21 carries for 83 yards and a touchdown but also fumbled twice, losing one of them. The Cowboys prevailed on the road 27\u201323. During Week 3 against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Chicago%20Bears%20season\"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt;, he posted his first game with over a hundred yards and finished the 31\u201317 victory with 140 rushing yards on 30 carries. In the next game, against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt;, he had 138 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 24-17 road victory. During Week 5 against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Cincinnati%20Bengals%20season\"&gt;Cincinnati Bengals&lt;/a&gt;, Elliott rushed for 134 yards on 15 carries and scored two rushing touchdowns, including a 60-yard touchdown as the Cowboys won 28\u201314. In the next game against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Green%20Bay%20Packers%20season\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt;, and Elliott continued his four-game streak with over 100 yards after carrying the ball 28 times for 157 rushing yards in the 30-16 road victory.\nAfter the ninth game of the 2016 season, he became the second Cowboys rookie to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, after &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Dorsett\"&gt;Tony Dorsett&lt;/a&gt; achieved the mark in 1977. He also became the third running back to rush for 1,000 yards after just the ninth game of his career, joining &lt;a href=\"Adrian%20Peterson\"&gt;Adrian Peterson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Dickerson\"&gt;Eric Dickerson&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring a Week 10 35-30 road victory over the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Pittsburgh%20Steelers%20season\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;, Elliott recorded 209 scrimmage yards and three touchdowns, including his first NFL receiving touchdown on an 83-yard pass from fellow rookie &lt;a href=\"Dak%20Prescott\"&gt;Dak Prescott&lt;/a&gt;, and a 32-yard run for the game-winning touchdown with nine seconds left. During a Week 11 27\u201317 victory over the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Baltimore%20Ravens%20season\"&gt;Baltimore Ravens&lt;/a&gt;, Elliott rushed for 97 yards and passed &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Dorsett\"&gt;Tony Dorsett&lt;/a&gt;'s Cowboys rookie rushing record on his second carry.\nIn Week 15, after scoring a touchdown against &lt;a href=\"2016%20Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers%20season\"&gt;Tampa Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Elliott jumped into an oversized &lt;a href=\"Salvation%20Army\"&gt;Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20kettle\"&gt;Red Kettle&lt;/a&gt;; an unusual &lt;a href=\"touchdown%20celebration\"&gt;touchdown celebration&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1997 the Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving Day football game halftime show has traditionally kicked off the Red Kettle campaign. With that rushing touchdown, he surpassed &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Dorsett\"&gt;Tony Dorsett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herschel%20Walker\"&gt;Herschel Walker&lt;/a&gt; for the Cowboys rookie record. He ran for 159 yards in the 26\u201320 victory. Because the Cowboys clinched the number one seed and home field advantage throughout the playoffs, Elliott rushed for 80 yards in a Week 16 42\u201321 victory over the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Detroit%20Lions%20season\"&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt; and did not play in the regular-season finale against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;.\nElliott finished his rookie year as the NFL's top rusher with 1,631 yards, which was the 47th best season all-time, the third most by a rookie (behind &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Dickerson\"&gt;Eric Dickerson&lt;/a&gt;'s 1,808 in 1983 and &lt;a href=\"George%20Rogers%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;George Rogers&lt;/a&gt;' 1,674 in 1981), and the youngest player to reach 1,600 yards. He finished third with 15 touchdowns behind &lt;a href=\"LeGarrette%20Blount\"&gt;LeGarrette Blount&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"David%20Johnson%20%28running%20back%29\"&gt;David Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. He tied &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Anderson%20%28running%20back%29\"&gt;Mike Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clinton%20Portis\"&gt;Clinton Portis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ickey%20Woods\"&gt;Ickey Woods&lt;/a&gt; for the second most all-time by a rookie behind &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Dickerson\"&gt;Eric Dickerson&lt;/a&gt;'s 18. Elliott's 464 yards after contact ranked fourth among NFL running backs. As a result of his successful season, Elliott was selected as a First-team &lt;a href=\"2016%20All-Pro%20Team\"&gt;All-Pro&lt;/a&gt;, and earned his first Pro Bowl, joining &lt;a href=\"Dak%20Prescott\"&gt;Dak Prescott&lt;/a&gt; as the first rookie running back and quarterback duo in NFL history to be selected. He was also ranked seventh by his peers on the &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Top%20100%20Players%20of%202017\"&gt;NFL Top 100 Players of 2017&lt;/a&gt; as the highest ranked running back.\nIn his first NFL playoff game, Elliott ran 22 times for 125 yards in a 34\u201331 loss to the Green Bay Packers in the , joining &lt;a href=\"Duane%20Thomas\"&gt;Duane Thomas&lt;/a&gt; as the only Cowboy rookie to rush for over 100 yards in a playoff game.\n2017 season.\nOn August 11, 2017, the NFL suspended Elliott for the first six games of the 2017 season for violating the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League%20player%20conduct%20policy\"&gt;personal conduct policy&lt;/a&gt;. His suspension stemmed from accusations of &lt;a href=\"domestic%20violence\"&gt;domestic violence&lt;/a&gt; against his ex-girlfriend on five occasions in 2016. NFL officials conducted a year-long investigation into the allegations, and though Elliott was never criminally charged, decided to suspend him. On August 16, Elliott announced that he would appeal the suspension. Although the suspension was upheld on September 6 by a league-appointed arbitrator, on September 8, a federal judge granted a request for injunction by the &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Players%20Association\"&gt;NFL Players Association&lt;/a&gt; (NFLPA), putting the suspension on hold indefinitely.\nIn the season-opener against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20New%20York%20Giants%20season\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; on \"&lt;a href=\"NBC%20Sunday%20Night%20Football\"&gt;NBC Sunday Night Football&lt;/a&gt;\", Elliott rushed for 104 yards on 24 attempts as the Cowboys won by a score of 19\u20133. During Week 2, Elliott had the worst game of his career statistically in an away game against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Denver%20Broncos%20season\"&gt;Denver Broncos&lt;/a&gt;. He was held to eight rushing yards on nine carries in the 42\u201317 road loss.\nOn October 12, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Fifth%20Circuit\"&gt;Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; announced that Elliot's suspension had been reinstated, meaning that he would have to serve the six-game suspension up from that point. On October 18, Elliott was granted a temporary restraining order, meaning that he would not have to serve his suspension from that point, allowing him to play in Week 7. During Week 7 against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt;, Elliott rushed for 147 yards and two touchdowns and had a 72-yard touchdown reception from Dak Prescott in the 40\u201310 road victory.\nOn October 30, Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the New York Southern District Court, denied Elliott's request for a preliminary injunction, which reinstated the 6-game suspension. The following day, the NFLPA filed an emergency motion for the injunction.\nOn November 3, Elliott was once again granted a stay by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Second%20Circuit\"&gt;United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit&lt;/a&gt;, which delayed the suspension.\nOn November 9, the suspension was once again reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Three days afterward, Elliott decided to accept the suspension and leave the country to train for a little while. On November 15, he officially announced that he withdrew from another appeal attempt. During his suspension, Elliott had been training and rehabbing his hamstrings in Mexico before his reinstatement. Elliott returned in Week 16 during a must-win situation against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Seattle%20Seahawks%20season\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt;, where he rushed for 97 yards on 24 carries. The Cowboys lost, 21\u201312, and were eliminated from playoff contention. In the regular season finale against the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;, Elliott recorded 27 carries for 103 rushing yards in the 6\u20130 victory.\nElliott finished the 2017 season with 242 carries for 983 yards and seven touchdowns to go along with 26 receptions for 269 yards and two touchdowns in 10 games and starts. He was ranked 54th by his peers on the &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Top%20100%20Players%20of%202018\"&gt;NFL Top 100 Players of 2018&lt;/a&gt;.\n2018 season.\nIn the first two games of the season, Elliott recorded a rushing touchdown in both games against the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Carolina%20Panthers%20season\"&gt;Carolina Panthers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2018%20New%20York%20Giants%20season\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;. During a Week 3 24-13 road loss to the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Seattle%20Seahawks%20season\"&gt;Seattle Seahawks&lt;/a&gt;, he rushed for 127 yards. In the next game against the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Detroit%20Lions%20season\"&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt;, he had 152 rushing yards along with four receptions for 88 yards and a touchdown in a 26\u201324 victory. During Week 6, he ran for 106 yards and a touchdown against the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Jacksonville%20Jaguars%20season\"&gt;Jacksonville Jaguars&lt;/a&gt;. With his only score, Elliott became the 12th Cowboy to reach 25 touchdowns on the ground as well as the fastest to do so, three games faster than &lt;a href=\"Emmitt%20Smith\"&gt;Emmitt Smith&lt;/a&gt;. During a Week 10 27-20 road victory, Elliott scored twice, racking up 151 rushing yards and 36 receiving yards against the reigning &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20LII\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; champions, the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season\"&gt;Philadelphia Eagles&lt;/a&gt;. He broke 150 yards rushing for the fifth time in his career, surpassing &lt;a href=\"DeMarco%20Murray\"&gt;DeMarco Murray&lt;/a&gt; for third-most in franchise history. In the next game, he recorded 201 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Atlanta%20Falcons%20season\"&gt;Atlanta Falcons&lt;/a&gt;, his fourth game over 200, tying with DeMarco Murray and Emmitt Smith for most in franchise history. Elliott continued his success, with 121 yards and a score on the run against the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Washington%20Redskins%20season\"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt; on Thanksgiving, eclipsing 1,000 yards on the year, the second time of his career, tied for third (along with DeMarco Murray &amp; &lt;a href=\"Calvin%20Hill\"&gt;Calvin Hill&lt;/a&gt;) most in Cowboys' history. In a narrow Week 13 13\u201310 road victory over the &lt;a href=\"2018%20New%20Orleans%20Saints%20season\"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt; on \"Thursday Night Football\", Elliott recorded 136 scrimmage yards and a receiving touchdown.\nElliott finished the 2018 season with 1,434 rushing yards and six touchdowns to go along with 77 receptions for 567 yards and three touchdowns in 15 games and starts. He won the rushing title for the second time in three seasons.\nThe Cowboys finished atop the &lt;a href=\"NFC%20East\"&gt;NFC East&lt;/a&gt; and made the playoffs as the #4-seed for the NFC Playoffs. In the 2019 NFC against the Seattle Seahawks, Elliott rushed 26 times for 137 yards and a touchdown in the 24\u201322 victory. In the against the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Los%20Angeles%20Rams%20season\"&gt;Los Angeles Rams&lt;/a&gt;, he had 20 carries for 47 yards and a touchdown in the 30\u201322 loss.\n2019 season.\nOn April 17, 2019, the Cowboys picked up the fifth-year option on Elliott's contract. However, Elliott began holding out during training camp, demanding a contract extension. On September 4, Elliott signed a six-year extension with the Cowboys worth $90 million, with $50 million guaranteed, keeping him under contract through the 2026 season.\nIn Elliott's first game back, he rushed 13 times for 53 yards and a touchdown in the 35\u201317 opening game victory over the &lt;a href=\"2019%20New%20York%20Giants\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;.
