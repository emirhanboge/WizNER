    "text": "A weekly newspaper is a general-news or &lt;a href=\"Current%20affairs%20%28news%20format%29\"&gt;current affairs&lt;/a&gt; publication that is issued once or twice a week in a wide variety &lt;a href=\"broadsheet\"&gt;broadsheet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magazine\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"electronic%20publishing\"&gt;digital&lt;/a&gt; formats. Similarly, a biweekly newspaper is published once every two weeks. Weekly newspapers tend to have smaller circulations than daily newspapers, and often cover smaller territories, such as one or more smaller towns, a rural county, or a few neighborhoods in a large city. Frequently, weeklies cover &lt;a href=\"local%20news\"&gt;local news&lt;/a&gt; and engage in &lt;a href=\"community%20journalism\"&gt;community journalism&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost weekly newspapers follow a similar format as daily newspapers (i.e., news, sports, &lt;a href=\"obituary\"&gt;obituaries&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). However, the primary focus is on news within a coverage area. The publication dates of weekly newspapers in North America vary, but often they come out in the middle of the week (Wednesday or Thursday). However, in the United Kingdom where they come out on Sundays, the weeklies which are called \"Sunday newspapers\", are often national in scope and have substantial circulations (20 to 50 per cent higher on average than their daily sister publications).\nOther types of news publications come out weekly on newsprint but are not considered general newspapers. These cover specific topics, such as sports (e.g., \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sporting%20News\"&gt;The Sporting News&lt;/a&gt;\") or business (e.g., \"&lt;a href=\"Barron%27s%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Barron's&lt;/a&gt;\"), and have larger circulations and cover much larger geographic-coverage areas. Alternatively, other news publications come out weekly on magazine-style print but are still considered general newspapers (e.g. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Economist\"&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;\").\nHistory.\nThe first weekly newspapers were &lt;a href=\"Relation%20aller%20F%C3%BCrnemmen%20und%20gedenckw%C3%BCrdigen%20Historien\"&gt;Relation&lt;/a&gt; and weekly newspaper &lt;a href=\"Avisa%20Relation%20oder%20Zeitung\"&gt;Aviso&lt;/a&gt;, which were published at beginning of 17th century. The \"Relation\" started around 1605 in &lt;a href=\"Stra%C3%9Fburg\"&gt;Stra\u00dfburg&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Carolus\"&gt;Johann Carolus&lt;/a&gt; and the \"Aviso\" started in January 1609 in &lt;a href=\"Wolfenb%C3%BCttel\"&gt;Wolfenb\u00fcttel&lt;/a&gt;.\nContent.\nMany weekly newspapers in North America follow a similar format:\nNews.\nNews coverage usually focuses on local events such as &lt;a href=\"car%20accident\"&gt;car accident&lt;/a&gt;s or house fires, plus local government meetings, such as city councils or school boards, and police blotters.\nSports.\nA weekly newspaper often covers sports teams from one or more area schools (mostly &lt;a href=\"secondary%20education\"&gt;high schools&lt;/a&gt;), communities, or professional teams if any exist. Often, a sports reporter takes great ownership in a specific team and writes stories containing detailed accounts of games. Several photographs of the games may accompany the story. Other stories preview games, usually between traditional rivals, to build interest.\nFamily news and obituaries.\nFamily news pages include announcements of births, engagements, weddings, landmark birthdays and anniversaries, and &lt;a href=\"obituary\"&gt;obituaries&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the past, correspondents often submitted stories along the lines of \"Mr. and Mrs. John Jones had company from out-of-town last week\", although these types of stories\u00a0\u2013 commonly called \"Neighborhood News\" or some similar name\u00a0\u2013 are largely a thing of the past.\nFeatures and reviews.\nLarger weeklies, especially those that are part of chains, also offer lifestyle features, reviews of local theater and arts, restaurant reviews and a food section that may concentrate on local recipes.\nEditorial pages.\nLike daily newspapers, weekly newspapers often have an editorial page. Editorial pages also include &lt;a href=\"letter%20to%20the%20editor\"&gt;letters to the editor&lt;/a&gt;, written by readers on a specific topic.\nPublic record.\nThe public-record section usually includes summaries of police-incident reports, fire-department calls and court dispositions (or, the outcome of a criminal proceeding). Many newspapers also publish a list of building permits that have been issued in its circulation area.\nPublic notices.\nPublic notices typically fall into one of two categories:\nLaws in many US states dictate that a &lt;a href=\"municipality\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; or other government body must designate a &lt;a href=\"official%20newspaper\"&gt;newspaper of record&lt;/a&gt;. The official newspaper is decided based on geographical area, and often more than one newspapers are given this designation. Official newspapers receive the government's public notices, and since they are considered advertising, it can be a source of revenue for newspapers.\nAdvertising.\nWeekly newspapers often have one or more &lt;a href=\"advertising\"&gt;advertising&lt;/a&gt; sales representatives whose job it is to sell display advertisements. Most advertisements are from local businesses (although some larger companies from outside the coverage area may advertise).\nOther advertisements are called &lt;a href=\"classified%20advertising\"&gt;classifieds&lt;/a&gt;, which are placed by people who want to buy or sell something (such as a car or real estate), employers who have job openings, or property owners who have rental property available.\nAlong with paid subscriptions, a weekly newspaper receives most of its revenue from &lt;a href=\"Newspaper%20display%20advertising\"&gt;display advertising&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"classified%20advertising\"&gt;classified advertising&lt;/a&gt;.\nLayout.\nMost weekly newspapers are laid out one or more days before the publication date. Sometimes, the layout of pages is staggered, to allow for multiple deadlines.\nLike larger newspapers, most weekly newspapers these days are &lt;a href=\"pagination\"&gt;paginated&lt;/a&gt; (or laid out) using computer software, using programs such as &lt;a href=\"Adobe%20PageMaker\"&gt;Adobe PageMaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adobe%20InDesign\"&gt;Adobe InDesign&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Quark%20Xpress\"&gt;Quark Xpress&lt;/a&gt;. Layout is the appearance of the page and includes photographs (along with cutlines, or captions identifying the photograph's content and people), copy (the text and its typefont), headlines and white space.\nAt many newspapers, photographers, reporters and editors use &lt;a href=\"digital%20camera\"&gt;digital camera&lt;/a&gt;s to take photographs and download selected photographs using a card reader. The photographs are cropped and edited using a program such as &lt;a href=\"Adobe%20Photoshop\"&gt;Adobe Photoshop&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the copy and &lt;a href=\"advertisements\"&gt;advertisements&lt;/a&gt; have been placed on the page, the editor will print out a proof and make any changes, if necessary. Sometimes, he or she will consult with &lt;a href=\"reporter\"&gt;reporter&lt;/a&gt;s on such things as double-checking facts, proofreading headlines and other copy, or writing cut-lines for photographs. Once everyone is satisfied, a final proof is printed out and prepared for publication. The pages can be placed on dummy sheets, burned to a &lt;a href=\"CD-ROM\"&gt;CD-ROM&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Zip%20disk\"&gt;Zip disk&lt;/a&gt;, or sent to the printing press (either located at the newspaper office or an off-site publication plant) by &lt;a href=\"e-mail\"&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt; or FTP site.\nStaff.\nOften, the staff of a weekly newspaper is smaller, with employees having several duties. For instance, a news editor may also sell advertising, while reporters could also be photographers.\nThe size of the news staff varies, depending on the size of the newspaper and its circulation area. Some papers have a staff of several &lt;a href=\"reporter\"&gt;reporter&lt;/a&gt;s, with each reporter having a specific beat (much like a daily newspaper, with beats including schools, local government, business, police, etc.). Many smaller newspapers, however, may have as few as one reporter to cover the entire circulation area, meaning they are responsible for the entire content of the newspaper (e.g., government, business, schools, crime, features, etc.).\nThe experience of weekly newspaper reporters varies. Some may have years of experience (either they are satisfied where they are employed, and/or may be well-established in the community). Others may be recent college graduates early in their career, and are trying to gain experience and/or clips.\nMany newspapers have at least one news clerk or editorial assistant who is responsible for typing family news and &lt;a href=\"obituary\"&gt;obituaries&lt;/a&gt;, as well as news releases announcing upcoming events. A circulation manager keeps track of subscribers (this can range from only a couple hundred to tens of thousands of subscribers), and may also be in charge of &lt;a href=\"classified%20advertising\"&gt;classified advertising&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs well as full-time staff reporters and photographers, many weekly newspapers also employ &lt;a href=\"correspondent\"&gt;correspondent&lt;/a&gt;s (sometimes called stringers), often paid on a per-story rate.\nFamily-owned and chains.\nMany weekly newspapers started as family-owned businesses, covering one or two communities and handling all editorial and business functions. \"The Tribune Newspaper\" in Humble, Texas is one example. Typically all business functions, along with the editor-in-chief would be family members, while non family members would assume reporting positions. Another example is the \"Campbell County Observer\" published in N.E. Wyoming. The owner is the publisher who also performs advertising sales, writing, distribution, books, and other duties that may be required. His wife, Candice, is an advertising saleswoman, his 9-year-old and 4-year-old children are the insert stuffers, and they all are door-to-door subscription salespeople.\nAs newspapers became more expensive to operate and family members declined to join the business, many weekly newspapers were purchased by larger chains of weeklies. Some family-owned newspapers are operated as chains, with the family business operating weekly newspapers in multiple towns.\nThe chain newspapers can be either regional or national chains. Sometimes all advertising functions are combined, with a weekly newspaper containing both ads for local businesses and for businesses in the chains area. This larger circulation can assist in bringing in national advertising to weeklies. Weeklies in chains may also have a publisher overseeing several newspapers, with a specific editor for each newspaper.\nChange of the day on them.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the day of the week that &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20Day\"&gt;Christmas Day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"December%2025\"&gt;December 25&lt;/a&gt; is on, weekly newspapers would change the day in many countries. For example, Sunday Newspapers are moved to &lt;a href=\"Christmas%20Eve\"&gt;Christmas Eve&lt;/a&gt; or Saturday when Christmas Day is on Sunday, and other weekly newspapers are expected to change their day at Christmas to save shops from opening on Christmas Day by law."
