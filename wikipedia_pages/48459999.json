    "text": "Abu Torab (), better known by his dynastic name of Ismail III (), was a &lt;a href=\"Safavid%20dynasty\"&gt;Safavid&lt;/a&gt; prince, who reigned as a figurehead under the authority of &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Mardan%20Khan%20Bakhtiari\"&gt;Ali Mardan Khan Bakhtiari&lt;/a&gt; briefly from 1750 to 1751, and then under the &lt;a href=\"Zand%20dynasty\"&gt;Zand&lt;/a&gt; ruler &lt;a href=\"Karim%20Khan%20Zand\"&gt;Karim Khan Zand&lt;/a&gt; from 1751 till his death in 1773.\nBiography.\nAbu Torab's father was Mirza Morteza, who was a former court official, and his mother was a daughter of the former Safavid king (&lt;a href=\"shah\"&gt;shah&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Husayn\"&gt;Sultan Husayn&lt;/a&gt; (r. 1694-1722).\nOn May 1750, the &lt;a href=\"Chahar%20Lang\"&gt;Chahar Lang&lt;/a&gt; chieftain &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Mardan%20Khan%20Bakhtiari\"&gt;Ali Mardan Khan Bakhtiari&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zand%20tribe\"&gt;Zand&lt;/a&gt; chieftain &lt;a href=\"Karim%20Khan%20Zand\"&gt;Karim Khan&lt;/a&gt; stormed the gates of &lt;a href=\"Isfahan\"&gt;Isfahan&lt;/a&gt;\u2014its governor &lt;a href=\"Abu%27l-Fath%20Khan%20Bakhtiari\"&gt;Abu'l-Fath Khan Bakhtiari&lt;/a&gt; and other prominent residents assembled to protect the fortress of the city, but agreed to surrender and collaborate with them after Ali Mardan's reasonable proposals. Abu'l-Fath, together with Ali Mardan and Karim Khan, formed an alliance in western Iran under the cover of restoring the Safavid dynasty, appointing the 17 year old Abu Torab as a puppet ruler\u2014on June 29, Abu Torab was declared shah, and assumed the dynastic name of Ismail III.\nAli Mardan then took the title of \"&lt;a href=\"Wakil\"&gt;Vakil-e&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"al-Dawla\"&gt;daulat&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"deputy of the state\") as the head of the administration, while Abu'l-Fath maintained his post as governor of Isfahan, and Karim Khan was appointed commander (\"&lt;a href=\"sardar\"&gt;sardar&lt;/a&gt;\") of the army, and was given the task of conquering the rest of Iran. Ali Mardan eventually broke the alliance by killing Abu'l-Fath and extracting heavy tax on the inhabitants.\nIn January 1751, Karim Khan returned to Isfahan and restored order in the city. A battle shortly occurred between him and Ali Mardan in &lt;a href=\"Lorestan%20Province\"&gt;Luristan&lt;/a&gt;\u2014during the battle, Ismail III and Zakariya Khan (who was now his \"&lt;a href=\"vizier\"&gt;vizier&lt;/a&gt;\"), together with several prominent officers, deserted Ali Mardan and joined Karim Khan, who eventually emerged victorious, forcing Ali Mardan and the remains of his men, together with the governor of Luristan, Ismail Khan Feyli, to retreat to &lt;a href=\"Khuzestan%20Province\"&gt;Khuzestan&lt;/a&gt;. After Karim Khan's accession as \"vakil\" (regent) in the same year, Ismail was kept in safe custody at the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Abadeh\"&gt;Abadeh&lt;/a&gt;, where lived till his death, in 1773."
