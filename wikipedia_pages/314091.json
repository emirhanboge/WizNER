He later served in the Meiji government as one of the founders of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nEnomoto was born as a member of a samurai family in the direct service of the &lt;a href=\"Tokugawa%20clan\"&gt;Tokugawa clan&lt;/a&gt; in the Shitaya district of &lt;a href=\"Edo\"&gt;Edo&lt;/a&gt; (modern &lt;a href=\"Tait%C5%8D\"&gt;Tait\u014d&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;). Enomoto started learning &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; in the 1850s, and after Japan's forced \"opening\" by &lt;a href=\"Commodore%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Commodore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20C.%20Perry\"&gt;Matthew Perry&lt;/a&gt; in 1854, he studied at the Tokugawa shogunate's &lt;a href=\"Nagasaki%20Naval%20Training%20Center\"&gt;Naval Training Center in Nagasaki&lt;/a&gt; and at the &lt;a href=\"Tsukiji\"&gt;Tsukiji&lt;/a&gt; Warship Training Center in Edo.\nAt the age of 26, Enomoto was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; to study western techniques in naval warfare and to procure western technologies. He stayed in Europe from 1862 to 1867, and became fluent in both the Dutch and &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; languages.\nEnomoto returned to Japan on board the , a steam warship purchased from the Netherlands by the Shogunal government. During his stay in Europe, Enomoto had realized that the &lt;a href=\"Telegraphy\"&gt;telegraph&lt;/a&gt; would be an important means of communication in the future, and started planning a system to connect Edo and &lt;a href=\"Yokohama\"&gt;Yokohama&lt;/a&gt;. Upon his return, Enomoto was promoted to , the second highest rank in the Tokugawa Navy, at the age of 31. He also received the court title of .\nBoshin War and Meiji Restoration.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Meiji%20Restoration\"&gt;Meiji Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, after the surrender of Edo in 1868 during the &lt;a href=\"Boshin%20War\"&gt;Boshin War&lt;/a&gt; to forces loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Satch%C5%8D%20Alliance\"&gt;Satch\u014d Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Enomoto refused to deliver up his warships, and escaped to &lt;a href=\"Hakodate\"&gt;Hakodate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hokkaido\"&gt;Hokkaido&lt;/a&gt; with the remainder of the Tokugawa Navy and a handful of &lt;a href=\"Second%20French%20Empire\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; military advisers and their leader &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Brunet\"&gt;Jules Brunet&lt;/a&gt;. His fleet of eight steam warships was the strongest in Japan at the time.\nEnomoto hoped to create an independent country under the rule of the Tokugawa family in &lt;a href=\"Hokkaid%C5%8D\"&gt;Hokkaid\u014d&lt;/a&gt;, but the Meiji government refused to accept partition of Japan. On 27 January 1869, the Tokugawa loyalists declared the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ezo\"&gt;Republic of Ezo&lt;/a&gt; and elected Enomoto as president.\nThe Meiji government forces invaded Hokkaid\u014d and defeated Enomoto's forces in the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Battle%20of%20Hakodate\"&gt;Naval Battle of Hakodate&lt;/a&gt;. On 27 June 1869, the Republic of Ezo collapsed, and Hokkaid\u014d came under the rule of the central government headed by the &lt;a href=\"Meiji%20Emperor\"&gt;Meiji Emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a Meiji politician.\nAfter his surrender, Enomoto was arrested, accused of &lt;a href=\"treason\"&gt;high treason&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned. However, the leaders of the new Meiji government (largely at the insistence of &lt;a href=\"Kuroda%20Kiyotaka\"&gt;Kuroda Kiyotaka&lt;/a&gt;) pardoned Enomoto in 1872, realizing that his various talents and accumulated knowledge could be of use. Enomoto became one of the few former Tokugawa loyalists who made the transition to the new ruling elite, as politics at the time was dominated by men from &lt;a href=\"Nagato%20Province\"&gt;Ch\u014dsh\u016b&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Satsuma%20Province\"&gt;Satsuma&lt;/a&gt;, who had a strong bias against outsiders in general, and former Tokugawa retainers in particular. However, Enomoto was an exception, and rose quickly within the new ruling &lt;a href=\"clique\"&gt;clique&lt;/a&gt;, to a higher status than any other member of the former Tokugawa government.\nIn 1874, Enomoto was given the rank of &lt;a href=\"vice-admiral\"&gt;vice-admiral&lt;/a&gt; in the fledgling &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Navy&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, he was sent to &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; as a special envoy to negotiate the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Saint%20Petersburg%20%281875%29\"&gt;Treaty of St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;. The successful conclusion of the treaty was very well received in Japan and further raised Enomoto's prestige within the ruling circles, and the fact that Enomoto had been chosen for such an important mission was seen as evidence of reconciliation between former foes in the government.\nIn 1880, Enomoto became . In 1885, his diplomatic skills were again called upon to assist &lt;a href=\"It%C5%8D%20Hirobumi\"&gt;It\u014d Hirobumi&lt;/a&gt; in concluding the &lt;a href=\"Convention%20of%20Tientsin\"&gt;Convention of Tientsin&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Qing%20Dynasty\"&gt;Qing China&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Enomoto held a series of high posts in the Japanese government. He was Japan's first &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Communications%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;Minister of Communications&lt;/a&gt; (1885\u20131888) after the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; system in 1885. He was also &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Agriculture%20and%20Commerce\"&gt;Minister of Agriculture and Commerce&lt;/a&gt; from 1894 to 1897, &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Education%2C%20Culture%2C%20Sports%2C%20Science%20and%20Technology%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;Minister of Education&lt;/a&gt; from 1889 to 1890 and &lt;a href=\"Minister%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;Foreign Minister&lt;/a&gt; from 1891 to 1892.\nIn 1887, Enomoto was ennobled to the rank of &lt;a href=\"viscount\"&gt;viscount&lt;/a&gt; under the \"&lt;a href=\"kazoku\"&gt;kazoku&lt;/a&gt;\" peerage system, and was selected as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Privy%20Council%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;Privy Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnomoto was especially active in promoting Japanese emigration through settler colonies in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Central%20America\"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt;. In 1891, he established\u2014against the will of the cabinet of &lt;a href=\"Matsukata%20Masayoshi\"&gt;Matsukata Masayoshi&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a \"section for &lt;a href=\"emigration\"&gt;emigration&lt;/a&gt;\" in the Foreign Ministry, with the task of encouraging emigration and finding new potential territories for Japanese settlement overseas. Two years later, after leaving the government, Enomoto also helped to establish a private organization, the \"Colonial Association\", to promote external trade and emigration.\nDeath.\nEnomoto died in 1908 at the age of 72. His grave is at the temple of &lt;a href=\"Kissh%C5%8D-ji\"&gt;Kissh\u014d-ji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bunky%C5%8D-ku\"&gt;Bunky\u014d-ku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; ()."
