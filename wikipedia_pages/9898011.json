    "text": "This is a list of the 129 cases reported in volume 103 of \"&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Reports\"&gt;United States Reports&lt;/a&gt;\", decided by the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; from November 1880 to May 1881.\nJustices of the Supreme Court at the time of volume 103 U.S..\nThe Supreme Court is established by &lt;a href=\"Article%20Three%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;Article III, Section 1&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Constitution of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, which says: \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court . . .\". The size of the Court is not specified; the Constitution leaves it to &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; to set the number of justices. Under the &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201789\"&gt;Judiciary Act of 1789&lt;/a&gt; Congress originally fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices). Since 1789 Congress has varied the size of the Court from six to &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Circuit%20Act%20of%201807\"&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20and%20Ninth%20Circuits%20Act%20of%201837\"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Circuit%20Act%20of%201863\"&gt;ten&lt;/a&gt;, and back to &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201869\"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt; justices (always including one chief justice). When the cases in volume 103 U.S. were decided the Court comprised nine of the following ten members at one time (&lt;a href=\"William%20Burnham%20Woods\"&gt;William Burnham Woods&lt;/a&gt; replaced &lt;a href=\"William%20Strong%20%28Pennsylvania%20judge%29\"&gt;William Strong&lt;/a&gt; in January 1881):\nNotable Cases in volume 103 U.S..\n\"Kilbourn v. Thompson\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Kilbourn%20v.%20Thompson\"&gt;Kilbourn v.

The Supreme Court held that the chamber has the power to punish persons for contempt if they refuse to obey a summons from the House.\n\"Neal v. Delaware\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Neal%20v.%20Delaware\"&gt;Neal v. Delaware&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.courtlistener.com/opinion/90336/neal-v-delaware/%3Fq%3D%2522103%2520U.S.%2520%2522%26amp%3Btype%3Do%26amp%3Border_by%3Dscore%2520desc%26amp%3Bstat_Precedential%3Don%26amp%3Bstat_In-chambers%3Don%26amp%3Bfiled_after%3D01%252F01%252F1880%26amp%3Bfiled_before%3D01%252F01%252F1882%26amp%3Bcourt%3Dscotus\"&gt;103 U.S. 370 (1881)&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court, with a majority opinion by Justice &lt;a href=\"John%20Marshall%20Harlan\"&gt;John Marshall Harlan&lt;/a&gt;, vacated the guilty verdict and death sentence on an African-American man accused of rape. In selecting persons to serve as jurors, no persons of color were in the &lt;a href=\"Jury%20selection\"&gt;jury pool&lt;/a&gt;, but rather were excluded because of their race though they were otherwise qualified. The Court held this to violate Neal's rights under the &lt;a href=\"Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;14th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;. Neal was acquitted in a second trial that included black men in the jury pool but not on the trial jury. \"Neal\" has been cited by appellate courts more than 200 times, most recently in 2019 by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"&lt;a href=\"Flowers%20v.%20Mississippi\"&gt;Flowers v. Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCitation style.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201789\"&gt;Judiciary Act of 1789&lt;/a&gt; the federal court structure at the time comprised District Courts, which had general trial jurisdiction; Circuit Courts, which had mixed trial and appellate (from the US District Courts) jurisdiction; and the United States Supreme Court, which had appellate jurisdiction over the federal District and Circuit courts\u2014and for certain issues over state courts. The Supreme Court also had limited &lt;a href=\"Original%20jurisdiction\"&gt;original jurisdiction&lt;/a&gt; (\"i.e.,\" in which cases could be filed directly with the Supreme Court without first having been heard by a lower federal or state court). There were one or more federal District Courts and/or Circuit Courts in each state, territory, or other geographical region.\n&lt;a href=\"Bluebook\"&gt;Bluebook&lt;/a&gt; citation style is used for case names, citations, and jurisdictions.
