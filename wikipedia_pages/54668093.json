    "text": "The 1926 KBUs Pokalturnering (Unofficial English translation: 1926 KBU Cup, 1926 Copenhagen Cup) was the 17th edition of the regional tournament, &lt;a href=\"KBUs%20Pokalturnering\"&gt;KBUs Pokalturnering&lt;/a&gt;, the highest senior cup competition organised by the &lt;a href=\"DBU%20Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen FA&lt;/a&gt; (KBU). The tournament was held in the fall of 1926 with &lt;a href=\"Boldklubben%20Frem\"&gt;BK Frem&lt;/a&gt;, then based on Enghavevej, as the defending cup champions. The season was launched with one match on 22 August 1926 between the last season's runners-up in &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen%20Series\"&gt;Copenhagen Football League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boldklubben%20af%201893\"&gt;B.93&lt;/a&gt; and the newly promoted league club &lt;a href=\"Boldklubben%20Fremad%20Amager\"&gt;BK Fremad Amager&lt;/a&gt;. This season's installment was won by B.93 after defeating &lt;a href=\"Kj%C3%B8benhavns%20Boldklub\"&gt;Kj\u00f8benhavns BK&lt;/a&gt; 5\u20131 in the final played at &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B8benhavns%20Idr%C3%A6tspark\"&gt;K\u00f8benhavns Idr\u00e6tspark&lt;/a&gt; on 7 November 1926, which was the club's fifth cup title after having contested in eight finals of the tournament. The 8 participants in the tournament included the six members of the &lt;a href=\"1925%E2%80%9326%20KBUs%20Mesterskabsr%C3%A6kke\"&gt;1925\u201326 KBUs Mesterskabsr\u00e6kke&lt;/a&gt; and the two highest placed teams from the &lt;a href=\"1925%E2%80%9326%20KBUs%20A-r%C3%A6kke\"&gt;1925\u201326 KBUs A-r\u00e6kke&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe runners-up of the &lt;a href=\"1925%E2%80%9326%20KBUs%20A-r%C3%A6kke\"&gt;1925\u201326 KBUs A-r\u00e6kke&lt;/a&gt;, the second-tier league under the &lt;a href=\"DBU%20Copenhagen\"&gt;Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldspil-Union&lt;/a&gt;, managed to reach the second round by defeating &lt;a href=\"Akademisk%20Boldklub\"&gt;Akademisk BK&lt;/a&gt; from the regional top-tier Copenhagen Football League, before eventually being eliminated by &lt;a href=\"%C3%98sterbro\"&gt;\u00d8sterbro&lt;/a&gt;-based B.93. In the very first round, the two KBUs Mesterskabsr\u00e6kke clubs of &lt;a href=\"Boldklubben%201903\"&gt;B 1903&lt;/a&gt; and BK Frem had to play two additional matches over the course of 5 weeks time before a winner could be found, that would go through to the semi-finals. &lt;a href=\"KFUMs%20Boldklub\"&gt;KFUMs BK&lt;/a&gt; and Kj\u00f8benhavns BK played one extra quarterfinal game to determine which club would participate in the semi-finals. The extra matches would generate an additional income of DKK 5\u20136,000 to both clubs. Forward &lt;a href=\"Poul%20Nielsen\"&gt;Poul \"Tist\" Nielsen&lt;/a&gt; of Kj\u00f8benhavns BK became the tournament's top goal scorer with 8 goals, which he scored during the course of the club's four cup matches.\nMatches.\nCup Final.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B8benhavns%20Idr%C3%A6tspark\"&gt;K\u00f8benhavns Idr\u00e6tspark&lt;/a&gt; acted as the host stadium on 7 November 1926 for the fourteenth time in the history of &lt;a href=\"KBUs%20Pokalturnering\"&gt;KBUs Pokalturnering&lt;/a&gt;. The weather at the game was sunny and relatively less windy, but with a wet and greasy surface due to the great rain shower in the morning and the previous night. This required high studs under the players' &lt;a href=\"football%20boot\"&gt;football boot&lt;/a&gt;s for stability, which not all players had. Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub's football kit consisted of blue-white shirts during the match, while the B.93 players had all white shirts. The final match was a repetition of the &lt;a href=\"1910%20KBUs%20Pokalturnering\"&gt;1910&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1916%20KBUs%20Pokalturnering\"&gt;1916&lt;/a&gt; cup finals, who had previously meet against each other a total of six times in the competition's history. Based on the team's recent league results, B.93 were regarded as favorites to win the cup title by various &lt;a href=\"newspaper\"&gt;newspaper&lt;/a&gt;s. The previous weekend, on 31 October 1926, the two teams had also met each other in the &lt;a href=\"1926%E2%80%9327%20KBUs%20Mesterskabsr%C3%A6kke\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; resulting in a 3\u20131 win to B.93.\nThe match was &lt;a href=\"Referee%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;refereed&lt;/a&gt; by Lauritz Andersen (affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Boldklubben%20Velo%20%28Copenhagen%29\"&gt;BK Velo&lt;/a&gt;) together with two of &lt;a href=\"DBU%20Copenhagen\"&gt;KBU's&lt;/a&gt; most used referees at that time, Valdemar Nilsson and Poul J\u00f8rgensen, as the &lt;a href=\"Assistant%20referee%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;linesmen&lt;/a&gt; featured in yellow shirts. The draw at the beginning of the match concerning the right to choose the starting half of the football field was won by Kj\u00f8benhavns BK's &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Poul%20Nielsen\"&gt;Poul \"Tist\" Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;, who choose the goal facing the western side of the stadium, towards \u00d8ster All\u00e9, which meant the KB players would start the game with the sun and wind in their backs. B.93 fielded the exact same team line-up, that they had used in their previous match the previous Sunday, while Kj\u00f8benhavns BK fielded three relatively new players in the squad, namely the newly promoted youth players Harald Lindemann, Holger \"Dirk\" Asmussen and Poul Hansen (as replacement for forward Erik Eriksen) \u2014 the last one having played youth matches the previous season and reserve team matches in the fall of 1926. Poul Hansen, placed as left innerwing, would get his debut on &lt;a href=\"Kj%C3%B8benhavns%20Boldklub\"&gt;KB's&lt;/a&gt; first team in this match. &lt;a href=\"Poul%20Nielsen\"&gt;Poul \"Tist\" Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt; of Kj\u00f8benhavns BK, was the only player on the field having also participated in the 1910 final, while &lt;a href=\"Anthon%20Olsen\"&gt;Anthon Olsen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Boldklubben%20af%201893\"&gt;B.93&lt;/a&gt; was the oldest player on the field being 37 years old.\nThe match started on time, 13:30 CET, with the referee emerging from the changing room in the basement of the stadium as the last one on the field, and the first several minutes began at a nervous, sluggish pace. The \u00d8sterbro-based team had the first dangerous attack in the match, which resulted in &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Rohde%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Michael Rohde&lt;/a&gt; getting a hard ball in his face, and the referee Lauritz Andersen having to halt the play for a small minute, and the club's masseuse Marx treating him. Shortly hereafter, in the 9th minute, B.93 forward &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Simonsen\"&gt;Magnus Simonsen&lt;/a&gt; outplayed Kj\u00f8benhavns BK defenders Aage J\u00f8rgensen and &lt;a href=\"Steen%20Steensen%20Blicher%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Steen Steensen Blicher&lt;/a&gt;, before passing the ball to &lt;a href=\"Svend%20Petersen%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Svend Petersen&lt;/a&gt;, who did not hesitate placing the ball resolute and hard in the right corner of the goal outside the reach of goalkeeper Poul Graae. The goal energized the players, who began playing in a much larger pace. Kj\u00f8benhavn BK attempted a few fruitless attacks against B.93's defense and goal, but the ball was primarily kept on KB's side with one attempt from B.93's forward Anthon Olsen hitting the upper goalpost before returning in play. A few minutes after, the referee called a foul on K.B.'s &lt;a href=\"Steen%20Steensen%20Blicher%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Steen Steensen Blicher&lt;/a&gt; using his arm improperly against Michael Rohde, and awarded B.93 a &lt;a href=\"Free%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;free kick&lt;/a&gt; 3 meters outside the &lt;a href=\"penalty%20area\"&gt;penalty area&lt;/a&gt;. Anthon Olsen executed the free kick, scoring directly in the right side of the goal, giving B.93 a 2\u20130 lead approximately halfway through the first half, above the reach of defender Valdemar Laursen standing at the goal line. This was followed by the KB players' best period in the match, which consisted of a series of attacks, one of which resulted in the referee awarding the team a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty kick&lt;/a&gt;. B.93's goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Svend%20Jensen\"&gt;Svend Jensen&lt;/a&gt; had unnecessarily driven his albow into the chin of the opponent's left inner wing Poul Hansen following Poul Hansen's attempt at heading the ball out of the keeper's hands. Steen Steensen Blicher scored from the &lt;a href=\"penalty%20spot\"&gt;penalty spot&lt;/a&gt;. A new free kick to B.93 was executed by Anthon Olsen, passing the ball to Michael Rohde, who scored his first goal of the match with only a few minutes missing of the first half. The opening half ended with a 3\u20131 lead to B.93.\nThe low-lying &lt;a href=\"Sunlight\"&gt;sunrays&lt;/a&gt; were pointing the Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub players directly in their faces in the second half, when their own goal was now located on the eastern side next to a &lt;a href=\"field%20hockey\"&gt;hockey&lt;/a&gt; field. Kj\u00f8benhavns BK players started with a period of superiority at the beginning of the second half, which however did not result in any goals. B.93 overtook that game advantage and kept it for the remaining part of the match, with K.B. only being allowed to play on their own terms momentarily. After circa 20 minutes of play in the second half, B.93's forward Michael Rohde received the ball from the right side of the field, outplayed defender Valdemar Laursen of K.B., and starting going towards the goal hard pressed by four opponents, and eventually placing the goal in the net behind Kj\u00f8benhavns BK's goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Poul%20Graae\"&gt;Poul Graae&lt;/a&gt;. Poul Graae was engaged in a lot of activities in front of his goal in the last part of the second half. Only one minute before the final whistle, B.93's Anthon Olsen attempted a shot against KB's Poul Graae, who only managed to push the ball to the right side. Svend Petersen was standing on that specific side of the goal, ready to make a pass to Michael Rohde, who scored another goal, obtaining a &lt;a href=\"Hat-trick\"&gt;hattrick&lt;/a&gt; in the game, giving B.93 a solid 5\u20131 lead and ending the cup final shortly hereafter. The only direct goal attempt by KB was made by Vilhelm Nielsen at the end of the match.\n&lt;a href=\"Boldklubben%20af%201893\"&gt;B.93&lt;/a&gt; won the final of the KBUs Pokalturnering and was crowned Copenhagen Cup Champions (Danish: KBU pokalmestre) by the representatives of the local football organisation, &lt;a href=\"DBU%20Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen FA&lt;/a&gt; (KBU), and acquiring their first \"lot\" (of five) in their efforts of being able to keep the trophy permanently. Newspapers \"&lt;a href=\"Berlingske%20Tidende\"&gt;Berlingske Tidende&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Fyens%20Stiftstidende\"&gt;Fyens Stiftstidende&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Dagbladet%20%281851%29\"&gt;Dagbladet&lt;/a&gt;\" graded Fritz Tarp, Michael Rohde and Anthon Olsen as the winning team's best players during the final. The finale had an attendance of approximately 13,000 spectators."
