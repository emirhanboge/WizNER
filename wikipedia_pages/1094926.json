    "text": "Sam Bass (July 21, 1851 \u2012 July 21, 1878) was a 19th-century American &lt;a href=\"Train%20robbery\"&gt;train robber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"outlaw\"&gt;outlaw&lt;/a&gt;, who died as a result of wounds sustained in a gun battle with &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Ranger%20Division\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt;. Notoriously, he was part of a gang that robbed a train of $60,000 (equivalent to $\u00a0million in ).\nEarly life.\nSamuel Bass was born in &lt;a href=\"Mitchell%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indiana\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, on July 21, 1851; the son of Daniel and Elizabeth Jane (Sheeks) Bass. He was orphaned before his thirteenth birthday, and afterward raised by an uncle. Bass left home at age 19.\nBass worked for about a year at a sawmill in &lt;a href=\"Rosedale%2C%20Mississippi\"&gt;Rosedale, Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually drifted west to north Texas; where he tried his hand at wrangling cattle in &lt;a href=\"Denton%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Denton&lt;/a&gt;. Unfulfilled by the hard work and little pay, he bought a horse and raced it, living off the proceeds for several years. After the horse became too old to race, Bass and a partner, Joel Collins, formed a cattle drive for several ranchers in the &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas\"&gt;San Antonio, Texas&lt;/a&gt; area. In 1876, they drove the cattle to Nebraska, but squandered their (and the ranchers') proceeds by gambling it away in the gold rush town of &lt;a href=\"Deadwood%2C%20South%20Dakota\"&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hills\"&gt;Black Hills&lt;/a&gt; area.\nLife of crime.\nNow broke, Bass and Collins tried working as freighters, but could not make a living at it, so they formed an outlaw gang preying on stage coaches. The gang literally struck gold when they robbed the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Pacific%20Railroad\"&gt;Union Pacific Railroad&lt;/a&gt; gold train from &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; on September 18, 1877. They intercepted the train at &lt;a href=\"Big%20Springs%2C%20Nebraska\"&gt;Big Springs, Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;. The robbery netted the gang over $60,000, and they split up.\nBass promptly headed back to Texas and formed a new gang responsible for a string of &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; robberies. In 1878, the gang held up two &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt;es and four trains within 25 miles (40\u00a0km) of &lt;a href=\"Dallas\"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;. Although the robberies netted them little money, they became the object of a manhunt by &lt;a href=\"Pinkerton%20National%20Detective%20Agency\"&gt;Pinkerton National Detective Agency&lt;/a&gt; agents and a special company of the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Ranger%20Division\"&gt;Texas Rangers&lt;/a&gt; headed by Captain Junius Peak.\nA trap is set.\nBass was able to elude the Texas Rangers until a member of his gang, Jim Murphy, turned informant. Mr. Murphy's father, who was very ill at the time, had been taken into custody and held for questioning. He was not allowed to be seen by a doctor and was prevented from receiving medical treatment, which caused his condition to rapidly worsen. Lawmen sent a message to Murphy informing him that they had his father in custody, and that if Murphy did not agree to meet with them, they would continue to withhold medical treatment from the father. Knowing how sick his father was, Murphy agreed to the meeting. There, he reluctantly agreed to turn informant. &lt;a href=\"John%20B.%20Jones\"&gt;John B. Jones&lt;/a&gt; was subsequently notified of Bass's movements and set up an ambush at &lt;a href=\"Round%20Rock%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Round Rock, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where Bass and the gang planned to rob the Williamson County Bank.\nFinal shootout.\nOn July 19, 1878, Bass and his gang were scouting the area before the robbery. When they bought some tobacco at a store, they were noticed by &lt;a href=\"Williamson%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Williamson County&lt;/a&gt; Deputy Sheriff A. W. Grimes. When Grimes approached the men to request that they surrender their sidearms, he was shot and killed. A gunfight ensued. As Bass attempted to flee, he was shot by Texas Rangers George Herold and Sergeant Richard Ware. &lt;a href=\"Soapy%20Smith\"&gt;Soapy Smith&lt;/a&gt; and his cousin, Edwin, witnessed Ware's shot. Soapy exclaimed, \"I think you got him!\" An interesting note to all of this is the fact that no one in Round Rock, nor any of the visiting Texas Rangers, except Jim Murphy, knew what any of the Bass gang looked like. In fact, after Seaborne Barnes was killed and lay in the street, Ware had to have Murphy identify the body, as no one else knew who the man was. Ware himself stated that he had seen the same three men earlier in town crossing the street to enter the dry goods store, but in fact did not recognize them as the Bass gang.\nDeath.\nBass was later found lying in a pasture west of Round Rock by Williamson County Deputy James Milton Tucker. More specifically, Bass had to call out to the posse as they were about to ride by him, shouting, \"Hey I'm over here. I'm Sam Bass, the one you are looking for.\" He was taken into custody and died the next day on July 21, 1878, his 27th birthday. Bass was buried in Round Rock in what is now known as Round Rock Cemetery. His grave is now marked with a replacement headstone\u2014as the original suffered at the hands of souvenir collectors over the years. What remains of the original stone is on display at the &lt;a href=\"Round%20Rock%20Public%20Library\"&gt;Round Rock Public Library&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nThere are roads named after Bass in &lt;a href=\"Round%20Rock%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Round Rock, Texas&lt;/a&gt; and west of &lt;a href=\"Sanger%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Sanger, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Round Rock's \"Frontier Days\" celebration each year, performers re-enact the shootout in the old downtown.\n&lt;a href=\"Rosston%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Rosston, Texas&lt;/a&gt; celebrates Sam Bass Day annually on the third Saturday in July.\nDramatic representations.\nBass has since been portrayed in several books, radio programs, television shows, and movies."
