    "text": "As with other countries, the &lt;a href=\"exclusive%20economic%20zone\"&gt;exclusive economic zone&lt;/a&gt; (EEZ) off the coast of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; gives its &lt;a href=\"fishing%20industry\"&gt;fishing industry&lt;/a&gt; special fishing rights. It covers 11.4 million square kilometres (4.38 million sq mi), which is the second largest zone in the world, exceeding the land area of the United States.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"FAO\"&gt;FAO&lt;/a&gt;, in 2005, the United States harvested 4,888,621 &lt;a href=\"tonne\"&gt;tonne&lt;/a&gt;s of fish from &lt;a href=\"wild%20fisheries\"&gt;wild fisheries&lt;/a&gt;, and another 471,958 tonnes from &lt;a href=\"aquaculture\"&gt;aquaculture&lt;/a&gt;. This made the United States the fifth leading producer of fish, after China, Peru, India, and Indonesia, with 3.8 percent of the world total.\nManagement.\nHistorically, &lt;a href=\"fisheries\"&gt;fisheries&lt;/a&gt; developed in the U.S. as each area was settled. Concern for the sustainability of fishery resources was evident as early as 1871, when Congress wrote that \"... the most valuable food fishes of the coast and the lakes of the U.S. are rapidly diminishing in number, to the public injury, and so as materially to affect the interests of trade and commerce...\" However, it was not until 1976, with the &lt;a href=\"Magnuson-Stevens%20Fishery%20Conservation%20and%20Management%20Act\"&gt;Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act&lt;/a&gt;, that the federal government began actively &lt;a href=\"Fisheries%20management\"&gt;managing fisheries&lt;/a&gt;.\nToday, inland fisheries and nearshore marine fisheries are managed by state (or regional or county) fisheries commissions. State jurisdictions usually extend out to sea. Coastal fisheries in the EEZ beyond state jurisdictions are the responsibility of the &lt;a href=\"federal%20system\"&gt;federal system&lt;/a&gt;. The primary institutions of the federal system are eight regional &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Regional%20Fishery%20Management%20Councils\"&gt;fishery management councils&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service\"&gt;National Marine Fisheries Service&lt;/a&gt; (NMFS), also known as NOAA Fisheries. NMFS works in partnership with industry, universities, and state, local, and tribal agencies to collect data about commercial species. &lt;a href=\"Fisheries%20observer\"&gt;Fisheries observer&lt;/a&gt;s on fishing vessels, transmit real time data electronically to NMFS.\nNMFS works in partnership with the regional fishery management councils to prevent &lt;a href=\"overfishing\"&gt;overfishing&lt;/a&gt;, and restore overfished stocks. Objectives are to reduce fishing intensity, monitor the fisheries, and implement measures to reduce &lt;a href=\"bycatch\"&gt;bycatch&lt;/a&gt; and protect &lt;a href=\"essential%20fish%20habitat\"&gt;essential fish habitat&lt;/a&gt;. NMFS is establishing &lt;a href=\"marine%20protected%20area\"&gt;marine protected area&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"individual%20fishing%20quota\"&gt;individual fishing quota&lt;/a&gt;s, and implementing &lt;a href=\"ecosystem%20based%20fishery\"&gt;ecosystem based fishery&lt;/a&gt; management.\nWild fisheries.\nEEZ.\nThe U.S. &lt;a href=\"EEZ\"&gt;EEZ&lt;/a&gt; is the second largest in the world, 1.7 times the land area of the US, and includes eight &lt;a href=\"large%20marine%20ecosystem\"&gt;large marine ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;s:\nNearshore fisheries.\n&lt;a href=\"Littoral%20zone\"&gt;Nearshore&lt;/a&gt; fishing areas consist of &lt;a href=\"estuaries\"&gt;estuaries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coast\"&gt;coast&lt;/a&gt;al areas that lie within of the shoreline. These are under the control of the relevant coastal state rather than under &lt;a href=\"Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"NMFS\"&gt;NMFS&lt;/a&gt; control. They vary widely in species diversity and abundance. Many species are highly prized &lt;a href=\"game%20fish\"&gt;game fish&lt;/a&gt;, while others are small &lt;a href=\"forage%20fish\"&gt;forage fish&lt;/a&gt; used for &lt;a href=\"bait%20fish\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;, animal food, and industrial products. Those of greatest interest include &lt;a href=\"invertebrate\"&gt;invertebrate&lt;/a&gt; species like crabs, shrimps, abalones, clams, oysters, and scallops. Many species are of unknown status because it is difficult to assess their condition. There are no firm estimates exist for long term &lt;a href=\"Sustainable%20yield%20in%20fisheries\"&gt;potential yield&lt;/a&gt;.\nManagement is spread out among the coastal states and other local authorities, and a comprehensive treatment of the fisheries has not been attempted. Traditional techniques are usually employed, including size limits, catch limits, method restrictions, and area and time closures.\nCoastal fisheries.\nThe coastal fisheries are the fisheries that lie within of the coast that defines the exclusive economic zone, but outside the distance that defines the nearshore fisheries. Coastal fisheries are under federal control in the form of &lt;a href=\"NMFS\"&gt;NMFS&lt;/a&gt;, as well as under the control of one of the eight regional &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Regional%20Fishery%20Management%20Councils\"&gt;fishery management councils&lt;/a&gt;.\nNortheast.\nTraditionally the most valued fishery for the northeast region has been &lt;a href=\"groundfish\"&gt;groundfish&lt;/a&gt;. However, the groundfish, especially &lt;a href=\"haddock\"&gt;haddock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"yellowtail%20flounder\"&gt;yellowtail flounder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt;, have been &lt;a href=\"overfished\"&gt;overfished&lt;/a&gt;. Record-low spawning &lt;a href=\"Biomass%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;biomass&lt;/a&gt; levels occurred in 1993\u20131994, but these are now recovering. &lt;a href=\"Squaliformes\"&gt;Dogfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skate%20%28fish%29\"&gt;skate&lt;/a&gt; rebounded in the 1970s, while groundfish and flounder declined. These fish are an important part of the &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Bank\"&gt;Georges Bank&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next most important fishery by value is &lt;a href=\"American%20lobster\"&gt;American lobster&lt;/a&gt; and Atlantic &lt;a href=\"Scallop\"&gt;sea scallop&lt;/a&gt;. The Port of New Bedford, Massachusetts is America's #1 Fishing Port with fish landings valued at $369 million. Each year, there are nearly 50 million pounds of sea scallops landed there. The &lt;a href=\"striped%20bass\"&gt;striped bass&lt;/a&gt; was driven to low levels early in the 1980s. Catch restrictions were applied in the mid 1980s, and by 1995, this species of fish had recovered. The region has valuable &lt;a href=\"mollusk\"&gt;mollusk&lt;/a&gt; fisheries too. Offshore are sea scallops, surfclams, American lobsters, and &lt;a href=\"ocean%20quahog\"&gt;ocean quahog&lt;/a&gt;. Inshore are &lt;a href=\"oyster\"&gt;oyster&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"blue%20mussel\"&gt;blue mussel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Callinectes%20sapidus\"&gt;blue crab&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"clam\"&gt;clam&lt;/a&gt; fisheries. These fisheries are pretty much fully exploited.\nThe fisheries in the Northeast Region are governed mostly by Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). An example of successful regulation is the 1994 Amendment 4 to the Sea Scallop FMP. This set out to control scallop fishing effort by not accepting more entrants, by restricting the time vessels could fish each day, and by requiring bigger mesh sizes on &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20dredge\"&gt;dredges&lt;/a&gt;. Additional protection for scallops was given closing parts of &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Bank\"&gt;Georges Bank&lt;/a&gt; to groundfish fishing. The scallops recovered.\nSoutheast.\nThe Southeast region spans the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Sea\"&gt;Caribbean Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the US Southeast Atlantic. Important species are &lt;a href=\"menhaden\"&gt;menhaden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drum%20%28fish%29\"&gt;drum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sciaenidae\"&gt;croaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"invertebrates\"&gt;invertebrates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"highly%20migratory%20species\"&gt;highly migratory species&lt;/a&gt;, reef fish, and other &lt;a href=\"Littoral%20zone\"&gt;nearshore&lt;/a&gt; species.\nOverfishing of &lt;a href=\"king%20mackerel\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Spanish%20mackerel\"&gt;Spanish mackerel&lt;/a&gt; occurred in the 1980s. Regulations were introduced to restrict the size, amount of catch, fishing locations, and bag limits for recreational fishers as well as commercial fishers. &lt;a href=\"Gillnet\"&gt;Gillnet&lt;/a&gt;s were banned in waters off Florida. By 2001, the mackerel stocks had bounced back.\n&lt;a href=\"Menhaden\"&gt;Menhaden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Florida%20stone%20crab\"&gt;stone crabs&lt;/a&gt; and the three major species of shrimp - (&lt;a href=\"Farfantepenaeus%20duorarum\"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farfantepenaeus%20aztecus\"&gt;brown&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20white%20shrimp\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;) - are fully exploited. &lt;a href=\"Spiny%20lobster\"&gt;Spiny lobster&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"over-exploited\"&gt;over-exploited&lt;/a&gt;. Better data is needed if stocks are to be assessed accurately.\nUntil 2016, commercial &lt;a href=\"fish%20farming\"&gt;fish farming&lt;/a&gt; was prohibited in federal waters, meaning that the Gulf of Mexico was closed to the practice. &lt;a href=\"National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration\"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; announced in January 2016, however, that companies can now set up commercial aquaculture in the Gulf. This is the first opening of federal waters to fish farming, which NOAA hopes will increase production and reduce the US's dependence on foreign fish imports.\nPacific Coast.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Pacific Coast&lt;/a&gt;, important rich resources and species are &lt;a href=\"chum%20salmon\"&gt;chum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20halibut\"&gt;Pacific halibut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20salmon\"&gt;Pacific salmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shellfish\"&gt;shellfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"groundfish\"&gt;groundfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flatfish\"&gt;flatfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pelagic%20fish\"&gt;pelagic fish&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"herring\"&gt;herring&lt;/a&gt;, and nearshore species. The stocks are mostly overfished or fully exploited.\nIn Alaska, the &lt;a href=\"Aleutian%20Islands\"&gt;Aleutian Islands&lt;/a&gt;, a series of over 300 rocky islands, stretch over from southwest Alaska to Russia. They are home to the largest fishing port in the U.S., &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Harbor\"&gt;Dutch Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. The primary target species is &lt;a href=\"pollock\"&gt;pollock&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"crab\"&gt;crab&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"groundfish\"&gt;groundfish&lt;/a&gt; are also important. Between 1997 and 2001, groundfish were caught by &lt;a href=\"bottom%20trawling\"&gt;bottom trawling&lt;/a&gt;, a fishing method which destroys the &lt;a href=\"habitat\"&gt;habitat&lt;/a&gt; of the groundfish, the ocean floor &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt; communities. In 2005, about 80,000\u00a0km2 (30,000 sq mi) of seafloor around the Aleutian Islands were permanently closed to destructive fishing gears. In 2008, &lt;a href=\"NOAA\"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; fisheries created the Aleutian Islands Habitat Conservation Area (AIHCA), most of which is closed to bottom trawling. At 725,000\u00a0km2 (280,000 sq mi), the AIHCA is the largest &lt;a href=\"marine%20protected%20area\"&gt;marine protected area&lt;/a&gt; in the USA.\nWestern Pacific.\nThe Western Pacific region includes the western and central Pacific, the &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20Islands\"&gt;Hawaiian Islands&lt;/a&gt;, and the islands of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Marianas\"&gt;Northern Marianas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"American%20Samoa\"&gt;American Samoa&lt;/a&gt;. These are tropical or subtropical waters. They have large species diversity, but, because ocean nutrients are not rich, the &lt;a href=\"Sustainable%20yield%20in%20fisheries\"&gt;sustainable yields&lt;/a&gt; is low. Pelagic &lt;a href=\"armorhead\"&gt;armorhead&lt;/a&gt; is the only overfished stock.\nHigh sea fisheries.\nThe &lt;a href=\"high%20seas\"&gt;high seas&lt;/a&gt;, or international waters, are the waters outside the jurisdiction of the EEZ of any country. U. S. distant fisheries operate in some of these waters, alongside other nations, beyond the jurisdiction of any nation's coastal fisheries.\nHighly migratory species.\nThe main commercial species in the high seas are the &lt;a href=\"highly%20migratory%20species\"&gt;highly migratory species&lt;/a&gt;. These fish make long migrations across the high seas, and are fished by many nations. Highly migratory fish also cross boundaries without regard for international laws. In particular, they enter the EEZ zones of the U.S., which means they become important species also for U.S. coastal fisheries.\nIn the Atlantic, overfished species include:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Biomass%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;biomass&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"swordfish\"&gt;swordfish&lt;/a&gt; in the North Atlantic has increased, probably due to catch reduction and strong recruitment.\nIn the Pacific, these transboundary fisheries are also important to other &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Rim\"&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/a&gt; nations, and to U.S. fleets fishing within and beyond the EEZ. The major U.S. catch stock is tuna, though billfish, swordfish, and shark are also caught. These stocks account for 99 percent of the Western Pacific region's catch.\nSeamounts.\nA &lt;a href=\"seamount\"&gt;seamount&lt;/a&gt; is a mountain rising from the ocean seafloor that does not reach the ocean surface. They are defined by oceanographers as independent features that rise at least 1,000 meters above the seafloor. Seamounts became interesting during the 1960s, when it was discovered that they can maintain large stocks of commercially important fishes and invertebrates. From 1968 to about 1990, foreign fleets harvested pelagic &lt;a href=\"armorhead\"&gt;armorhead&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"seamount\"&gt;seamount&lt;/a&gt;s in the Hawaiian Ridge. Since 1984, fishing has been prohibited there so the stock can recover.\nGenerally, seamounts are found in the high seas, outside the continental shelves, and outside the jurisdiction of any nation's EEZ. However, the U.S. Pacific Coast region has an unusually small continental shelf, while the Western Coast region contains islands with no continental shelf. As a result, there are some seamounts within U.S. jurisdiction.\nInland fisheries.\nFisheries in inland waters of the United States are small compared to marine fisheries. The largest fisheries are the landings from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes\"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt;, worth about $13 million in 2003, with a similar amount from the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20River\"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt; basin. This is less than one percent of the dollar value of the marine fisheries.\nFishing fleet.\nUntil the late 19th century, the U.S. &lt;a href=\"fishing%20fleet\"&gt;fishing fleet&lt;/a&gt; used sailing vessels. By the early 20th century, &lt;a href=\"fishing%20vessel\"&gt;fishing vessel&lt;/a&gt;s were built as steam boats with steam engines, or as schooners with auxiliary gasoline engines. By the 1930s the fleet was almost completely converted to diesel vessels. Fishing gear became more technical: Alaska &lt;a href=\"purse%20seiner\"&gt;purse seiner&lt;/a&gt;s were in use by 1870, &lt;a href=\"longline%20fishing\"&gt;longliners&lt;/a&gt; were introduced in 1885; &lt;a href=\"otter%20trawl\"&gt;otter trawl&lt;/a&gt;s were operating in the &lt;a href=\"groundfish\"&gt;groundfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shrimp%20fisheries\"&gt;shrimp fisheries&lt;/a&gt; by the early 20th century. In the late 1960s, &lt;a href=\"factory%20ship\"&gt;factory ship&lt;/a&gt;s from other countries started fishing &lt;a href=\"haddock\"&gt;haddock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"herring\"&gt;herring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"halibut\"&gt;halibut&lt;/a&gt; on traditional U.S. fishing grounds.\nTechnological advances have played an important role in the development of U.S. fisheries.\nIncreases in size and speed allowed vessels to fish in more distant waters. Advances include double &lt;a href=\"trawl\"&gt;trawl&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Puretic%20power%20block\"&gt;Puretic power block&lt;/a&gt;s for retrieving seine nets, refrigerated holds, durable &lt;a href=\"Monofilament%20line\"&gt;synthetic fibres&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20line\"&gt;lines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20net\"&gt;nets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"GPS\"&gt;GPS&lt;/a&gt; to navigate and locate fishing grounds, &lt;a href=\"fishfinder\"&gt;fishfinder&lt;/a&gt;s for the location of fish, and &lt;a href=\"spotter%20plane\"&gt;spotter plane&lt;/a&gt;s to locate fish schools.\nThe vessel size and gear types of the U.S. fishing fleet varies geographically and between fisheries. Because of this, management of U.S. fisheries with a single policy is not feasible. Individual fisheries have their own biological, economic, and sociological characteristics which make broad policies impractical. On the other hand, ad hoc regulations for individual fisheries is not practical either.\nU.S. fisheries use most fishing gear types. Vessels are often configured so they can change rapidly between two or more gear types, such as &lt;a href=\"lobster%20pot\"&gt;lobster pot&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"bottom%20trawl\"&gt;bottom trawl&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"scallop%20dredge\"&gt;scallop dredge&lt;/a&gt;s. The main techniques are &lt;a href=\"Purse%20seine\"&gt;purse seining&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trawling\"&gt;trawling&lt;/a&gt;. Some vessels freeze their catch at sea, such as &lt;a href=\"factory%20trawler\"&gt;factory trawler&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tuna\"&gt;tuna&lt;/a&gt; boats, Alaskan &lt;a href=\"Alaskan%20king%20crab%20fishing\"&gt;crab pot&lt;/a&gt; vessels, and some southeast shrimp trawlers. Vessels usually land their catches near their &lt;a href=\"homeport\"&gt;homeport&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBycatch mitigation.\nBased in Hawaii, a &lt;a href=\"longline%20fishing\"&gt;longline&lt;/a&gt; fishery for &lt;a href=\"tuna\"&gt;tuna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"billfish\"&gt;billfish&lt;/a&gt; were popular. Now, new &lt;a href=\"Fisheries%20management\"&gt;management approaches&lt;/a&gt;, including placing &lt;a href=\"fisheries%20observer\"&gt;fisheries observer&lt;/a&gt;s on vessels to observe what is happening with &lt;a href=\"protected%20species\"&gt;protected species&lt;/a&gt; such as albatross and leatherback, loggerhead and green sea turtles, is expected to reduce &lt;a href=\"incidental%20catch\"&gt;incidental catch&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverfished stocks.\nBy 2003, &lt;a href=\"overfishing\"&gt;overfishing&lt;/a&gt; had occurred on 60 stocks. Another 232 stocks were not overfished. Overfishing had been stopped on 31 stocks, and a gain was made of 13 stocks that had been fully rebuilt. There were 617 other stocks which have limited data or for which criteria for overfishing had not been defined. These stocks mostly have harvests which are not significant, so they are not allocated research funding. Their assessment can be expensive, and there is no evidence of overfishing. Rebuilding strategies are operating or are being developed for most stocks which are overfished.\nThere were 267 major stocks, that is, stocks with at least 200,000 pounds (91,000\u00a0kg) in annual landings. Of these, 40 were overfished, 147 were not, and it was not known whether the remaining 80 stocks were overfished. There were 642 minor stocks, of which 20 were overfished, 85 were not, and the remainder had an overfishing status which is unknown or is undefined.\nMarine protected areas.\nA &lt;a href=\"marine%20protected%20area\"&gt;marine protected area&lt;/a&gt; (MPA) is federally defined as: \"any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, tribal, territorial, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein.\"\nFourteen MPAs covering have been federally designated as &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20National%20Marine%20Sanctuary\"&gt;National Marine Sanctuaries&lt;/a&gt;, and are administered by a division of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration\"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; (NOAA).\nIn practice, these MPAs are defined areas where natural and/or cultural resources are given more protection than occurs in the surrounding waters. United States MPAs cover many habitats including the &lt;a href=\"open%20ocean\"&gt;open ocean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coastal\"&gt;coastal&lt;/a&gt; areas, &lt;a href=\"intertidal%20zone\"&gt;intertidal zone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"estuary\"&gt;estuaries&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lakes\"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt;. They vary in purpose, legal authorities, agencies, management approaches, level of protection, and restrictions on human uses.\nAquaculture.\nThe value of &lt;a href=\"aquaculture\"&gt;aquaculture&lt;/a&gt; products grew from $45 million in 1974 to about $866 million (393,400 tonnes) in 2003.\nAquaculture, in the United States, includes the &lt;a href=\"Fish%20farm\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Fish%20hatchery\"&gt;hatchery fish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shellfish\"&gt;shellfish&lt;/a&gt; which are grown to market size in ponds, tanks, cages, or &lt;a href=\"raceway%20%28aquaculture%29\"&gt;raceway&lt;/a&gt;s, and released into the wild. Aquaculture is also used to support commercial and recreational marine fisheries by enhancing or rebuilding wild &lt;a href=\"Fish%20stocks\"&gt;stock populations&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes the cultivation of ornamental fish for the &lt;a href=\"aquarium\"&gt;aquarium&lt;/a&gt; trade, as well as plant species used in various pharmaceutical, nutritional, and biotechnology products.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"FAO\"&gt;FAO&lt;/a&gt;, in 2004 the United States ranked 10th in total aquaculture production, behind China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Japan, Chile, and Norway. The United States imports aquaculture products from these and other countries, and operates an annual seafood trade deficit of over $9 billion.\nShellfish (&lt;a href=\"oyster\"&gt;oyster&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"clam\"&gt;clam&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mussel\"&gt;mussel&lt;/a&gt;s), account for two-thirds of marine aquaculture production, followed by &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; (25 percent) and &lt;a href=\"shrimp\"&gt;shrimp&lt;/a&gt; (10 percent). Production occurs mainly on land, in ponds, and in coastal waters under state jurisdiction. As a result of recent advances in offshore aquaculture technology, commercial finfish and shellfish operations have been established in more exposed, open ocean locations in state waters in &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire\"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Rico\"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;.\nTotal U.S. aquaculture production, including &lt;a href=\"aquatic%20plants\"&gt;aquatic plants&lt;/a&gt;, is about $1 billion annually, compared to the total world production of about $70 billion. Only about 20 percent of U.S. aquaculture production is from marine species. &lt;a href=\"NOAA\"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; estimates that the annual U.S. domestic aquaculture production of all species could increase from about 0.5 million tons to 1.5 million tons by 2025.\nEnvironmental regulations.\nLarge aquaculture facilities (i.e. those producing per year) which discharge &lt;a href=\"industrial%20wastewater\"&gt;wastewater&lt;/a&gt; are required to obtain permits pursuant to the &lt;a href=\"Clean%20Water%20Act\"&gt;Clean Water Act&lt;/a&gt;. Facilities that produce at least of fish, molluscs or crustaceans a year are subject to specific national discharge standards. Other permitted facilities are subject to effluent limitations that are developed on a case-by-case basis.\nSubsidies.\nIn a study of federal investment in the fishery sector in 1999, most aspects of United States tax, fisheries, and societal policies were examined to see whether they created &lt;a href=\"subsidies%20for%20the%20fishing%20industry\"&gt;subsidies for the fishing industry&lt;/a&gt; and whether these subsidies had impacts. The gross value of direct U.S. subsidies was about 0.5% of the gross ex-vessel value of commercial landings. There are no major ship construction subsidies, market development, or other forms of assistance that often exist in developed and developing fishing industries around the world.\nRecreational.\nIn 2006, the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service\"&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt; estimated that 30.0 million U.S. anglers, 16 years old and older, took 403 million fishing trips, spending $42.0 billion in fishing related expenses. Of these, 25.4 million were freshwater anglers who took 337 million trips and spent $26.3 billion. Saltwater fishing attracted 7.7 million anglers who took 67 million trips and spent $8.9 billion."
