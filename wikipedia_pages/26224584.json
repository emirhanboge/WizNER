    "text": "Jacawitz () (also spelt Jakawitz, Jakawits, Q\u02bcaq\u02bcawits and Hacavitz) was a mountain &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Maya%20gods%20and%20supernatural%20beings\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20chronology\"&gt;Postclassic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%CA%BCiche%CA%BC%20people\"&gt;K\u02bciche\u02bc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maya%20civilization\"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt; of highland &lt;a href=\"Guatemala\"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;. He was the patron of the Ajaw K\u02bciche\u02bc lineage and was a companion of the sun god &lt;a href=\"Tohil\"&gt;Tohil&lt;/a&gt;. It is likely that he received &lt;a href=\"Human%20sacrifice%20in%20Maya%20culture\"&gt;human sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;. The word \"jacawitz\" means \"mountain\" in the lowland &lt;a href=\"Maya%20languages\"&gt;Maya language&lt;/a&gt;, and the word \"q\u02bcaq\u02bcawitz\" of the highland Maya means \"fire mountain\", which suggests that Jacawitz was mainly a fire deity, much like Tohil. In the &lt;a href=\"Mam%20language\"&gt;Mam language&lt;/a&gt;, the similar word \"xq\u02bcaqwitz\" means \"yellow wasp\" and the wasp was an important symbol of the deity and its associated lineage. In the &lt;a href=\"Ch%CA%BCol%20language\"&gt;Cholan languages&lt;/a&gt;, \"jacawitz\" means \"first mountain\", linking the god with the first mountain of creation.\nIn the K\u02bciche\u02bc epic &lt;a href=\"Popul%20Vuh\"&gt;Popul Vuh&lt;/a&gt;, the first people gathered at the mythical place &lt;a href=\"Tollan\"&gt;Tollan&lt;/a&gt; to receive their gods, and Mahucutah, one of the gathered K\u02bciche\u02bc lords, received Jacawitz. The mid-9th century Stela 8 at the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20chronology\"&gt;Terminal Classic&lt;/a&gt; lowland Maya site of &lt;a href=\"Seibal\"&gt;Seibal&lt;/a&gt; describes a visitor to the city named Hakawitzil. This is an early spelling of Jacawitz and &lt;a href=\"Mayanist\"&gt;Mayanist&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Linda%20Schele\"&gt;Linda Schele&lt;/a&gt; and Peter Mathews have proposed that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the &lt;a href=\"Founding%20myth\"&gt;foundation legends&lt;/a&gt; of the K\u02bciche\u02bc. As well as being mentioned frequently in the Popul Vuh, Jacawitz is also mentioned in the K\u02bciche\u02bc document \"T\u00edtulo de los Se\u00f1ores de Totonicap\u00e1n\".\nJacawitz was one of a triad of K\u02bciche\u02bc deities, the other two being Tohil and the goddess &lt;a href=\"Awilix\"&gt;Awilix&lt;/a&gt;, all three were sometimes collectively referred to as Tohil, the principal member of the triad. The concept of a trinity of deities was an ancient one in Maya culture, dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20chronology\"&gt;Preclassic period&lt;/a&gt;.\nTemple of Jacawitz.\nThe Ahaw K\u02bciche\u02bc were the founding lineage of the K\u02bciche\u02bc Maya, although they later lost power to the Kaweq lineage; as they lost status within the kingdom, so did their patron god. The temple of Jacawitz at the K\u02bciche\u02bc capital of &lt;a href=\"Q%CA%BCumarkaj\"&gt;Q\u02bcumarkaj&lt;/a&gt; was one of the three tallest buildings in the city, although it faced away from the main plaza. The temple is a large mound south of the plaza, its stonework has been stripped away making its original form uncertain, although a 19th-century plan of the city recorded it as a &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerican%20pyramids\"&gt;pyramid&lt;/a&gt;. This pyramid temple was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side, a palace on the south side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz temple complex has not yet been investigated archaeologically. The 19th century drawings by Miguel Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces."
