    "text": "Carmel Myers (April 9, 1899 \u2013 November 9, 1980) was an American actress who achieved her greatest successes in &lt;a href=\"silent%20film\"&gt;silent film&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nMyers was born in &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of Isidore Myers, a &lt;a href=\"Russian-Jewish\"&gt;Russian-Jewish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rabbi\"&gt;rabbi&lt;/a&gt; who was born in Russia but raised in Australia, and Anna Jacobson Myers, an &lt;a href=\"Austrian-Jewish\"&gt;Austrian-Jew&lt;/a&gt;. She had an older brother, Zion, and she was a cousin of director &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Sandrich\"&gt;Mark Sandrich&lt;/a&gt; and photographer &lt;a href=\"Ruth%20Harriet%20Louise\"&gt;Ruth Harriet Louise&lt;/a&gt;. Carmel's father was active in campaigns for &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20suffrage\"&gt;women's suffrage&lt;/a&gt;, abolition of capital punishment, and &lt;a href=\"zionism\"&gt;zionism&lt;/a&gt;. He also was a noted scholar. The family moved to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; in 1905.\nMyers attended &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20High%20School\"&gt;Los Angeles High School&lt;/a&gt; but left after &lt;a href=\"D.%20W.%20Griffith\"&gt;D. W. Griffith&lt;/a&gt; gave her bit part in the film \"&lt;a href=\"Intolerance%20%28film%29\"&gt;Intolerance&lt;/a&gt;\" (1916), for which her father was an unpaid consultant. She continued her education at a school for young actors.\nMyers helped her brother become a writer and director in Hollywood.\nCareer.\nSilent film and theater.\nMyers left for New York City, where she acted mainly in theater for the next two years. She was signed by &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Studios\"&gt;Universal&lt;/a&gt;, where she emerged as a popular actress in &lt;a href=\"vamp%20%28woman%29\"&gt;vamp&lt;/a&gt; roles. Her most popular film from this period\u2014which does not feature her in a vamp role\u2014is probably the &lt;a href=\"romantic%20comedy\"&gt;romantic comedy&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"All%20Night%20%28film%29\"&gt;All Night&lt;/a&gt;\", opposite &lt;a href=\"Rudolph%20Valentino\"&gt;Rudolph Valentino&lt;/a&gt;, who was then a little-known actor. She also worked with him in \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Society%20Sensation\"&gt;A Society Sensation&lt;/a&gt;\". By 1924, she was working for &lt;a href=\"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\"&gt;Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&lt;/a&gt;, making such films as \"Broadway After Dark\", which also starred &lt;a href=\"Adolphe%20Menjou\"&gt;Adolphe Menjou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norma%20Shearer\"&gt;Norma Shearer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anna%20Q.%20Nilsson\"&gt;Anna Q. Nilsson&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1925, she appeared in arguably her most famous role, that of the Egyptian vamp Iras in \"\", who tries to seduce both Messala (&lt;a href=\"Francis%20X.%20Bushman\"&gt;Francis X. Bushman&lt;/a&gt;) and Ben-Hur himself (&lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20Novarro\"&gt;Ram\u00f3n Novarro&lt;/a&gt;). This film was a boost to her career, and she appeared in major roles throughout the 1920s, including \"&lt;a href=\"Tell%20It%20to%20the%20Marines\"&gt;Tell It to the Marines&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1926 with &lt;a href=\"Lon%20Chaney%2C%20Sr.\"&gt;Lon Chaney, Sr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Haines\"&gt;William Haines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20Boardman\"&gt;Eleanor Boardman&lt;/a&gt;. Myers appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Four%20Walls%20%28film%29\"&gt;Four Walls&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Dream%20of%20Love\"&gt;Dream of Love&lt;/a&gt;\", both with &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Crawford\"&gt;Joan Crawford&lt;/a&gt; in 1928; and in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Show%20of%20Shows\"&gt;The Show of Shows&lt;/a&gt;\" (1929), a showcase of popular contemporary film actors.\nSound films, radio, and television.\nMyers had a fairly successful sound career, mostly in supporting roles, perhaps due to her image as a vamp rather than as a sympathetic heroine. Subsequently, she began giving more attention to her private life following the birth of her son in May 1932. Amongst her popular sound films are \"&lt;a href=\"Svengali%20%281931%20film%29\"&gt;Svengali&lt;/a&gt;\" (1931) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mad%20Genius\"&gt;The Mad Genius&lt;/a&gt;\" (1931), both with &lt;a href=\"John%20Barrymore\"&gt;John Barrymore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marian%20Marsh\"&gt;Marian Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and a small role in 1944's \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Conspirators%20%281944%20film%29\"&gt;The Conspirators&lt;/a&gt;\", which featured &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Henreid\"&gt;Paul Henreid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Lorre\"&gt;Peter Lorre&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Greenstreet\"&gt;Sydney Greenstreet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1939, Myers performed for 13 weeks on the Resinol radio program that was broadcast twice weekly from station &lt;a href=\"KHJ%20%28AM%29\"&gt;KHJ&lt;/a&gt; and carried on the &lt;a href=\"Don%20Lee%20Network\"&gt;Don Lee Network&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1951, Myers had a celebrity interview TV program, \"The Carmel Myers Show\", on &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;. In 1952, she formed Carmel Myers Productions, a firm for producing radio and TV programs. The company's productions included \"Mark Hellinger Tales\", a transcribed series of 30-minute radio dramas with Edward Arnold as narrator and \"Cradle of Stars\", a 30-minute filmed TV series with Gregory Ratoff as director and star.\nLater, she focused on a career in real estate and her perfume distribution company. In 1976, Myers was one of the very few silent stars who were cast in \"&lt;a href=\"Won%20Ton%20Ton%2C%20the%20Dog%20Who%20Saved%20Hollywood\"&gt;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;\", a comedy featuring cameos by dozens of Hollywood stars of the past.\nBook.\nIn 1952, Doubleday &amp; Company published \"Don't Think About It\", a 64-page book by Myers. Based on her experiences following the death of her husband, the book related her philosophy for emotional survival after a person has a tragedy in his or her life.\nPersonal life.\nMyers married attorney and song writer Isidore \"I.B.\" Kornblum on July 16, 1919; they divorced in 1923.\nMyers and attorney Ralph H. Blum married on June 9, 1929, and had three children: author Ralph H. Blum (born 1932), known for his works on divination through Norse &lt;a href=\"runes\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt;, and two adopted daughters, actress and radio personality Susan Adams Kennedy (born 1940) and television producer Mary Cossette (born 1941). Myers and Blum purchased &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Swanson\"&gt;Gloria Swanson&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Boulevard\"&gt;Sunset Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; home.\nOn October 30, 1951, Myers married &lt;a href=\"Paramount%20Pictures\"&gt;Paramount Pictures&lt;/a&gt; executive Alfred W. Schwalberg in Brooklyn. They were married until his death in 1974.\nDeath.\nMyers died of a heart attack on November 9, 1980, in Los Angeles Medical Center at the age of 81. She was buried near her parents at &lt;a href=\"Home%20of%20Peace%20Cemetery%20%28East%20Los%20Angeles%29\"&gt;Home of Peace Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in East Los Angeles. Her epitaph reads \"L'Chaim\", which in English translates to \"To life\"."
