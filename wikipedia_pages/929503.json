    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;Liberalism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"radicalism%20%28historical%29\"&gt;radicalism&lt;/a&gt; have played a role in the political history of &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; since the country's &lt;a href=\"Italian%20unification\"&gt;unification&lt;/a&gt;, started in 1861 and largely completed in 1871, and currently influence several leading political parties.\nDuring the first decades of Italy as a united country, the main parliamentary parties included liberals, but it was not until 1877 that the left-wing &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Radical%20Party\"&gt;Radical Party&lt;/a&gt; was established as the first organized liberal party. The more centrist &lt;a href=\"Liberals%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Liberal Union&lt;/a&gt; followed in 1913. Most liberal and radical parties were banned in 1926 under &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Mussolini\"&gt;Benito Mussolini&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Fascism\"&gt;Fascist&lt;/a&gt; government.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Italian%20Republic\"&gt;Italian Republic&lt;/a&gt; there have been frequent changes in the configuration of political parties and, for the most part, the representation of liberal and radical views has been split among a number of parties that may also espouse other views. These parties have often been part of governing &lt;a href=\"coalition\"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Italian%20Republic%23The%20%26quot%3BFirst%20Republic%26quot%3B%20%281948%E2%80%931992%29\"&gt;First Republic&lt;/a&gt;\" three minor liberal parties were active: the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Italian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; (centre-right), the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Republican%20Party\"&gt;Italian Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; (centre-left) and the modern-day &lt;a href=\"Radical%20Party%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Radical Party&lt;/a&gt; (left-wing). More recently, liberals have been split primarily among the centre-right &lt;a href=\"The%20People%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;The People of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Forza%20Italia%20%282013%29\"&gt;Forza Italia&lt;/a&gt; and the centre-left &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nIn the 19th century both early Italian political groupings, the &lt;a href=\"Historical%20Right\"&gt;Historical Right&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Historical%20Left\"&gt;Historical Left&lt;/a&gt;, were composed of &lt;a href=\"monarchism\"&gt;monarchist&lt;/a&gt; liberals and functioned mainly as loose &lt;a href=\"parliamentary%20group\"&gt;parliamentary group&lt;/a&gt;s, while radicals organised themselves as the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Radical%20Party\"&gt;Radical Party&lt;/a&gt;, and republicans, who were influenced also by &lt;a href=\"socialism\"&gt;socialism&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Republican%20Party\"&gt;Italian Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;. These two parties had in fact been part of &lt;a href=\"Historical%20Far%20Left\"&gt;The Extreme&lt;/a&gt;, which included also the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Italian Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; and its predecessors.\nIn 1913 the liberals around &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Giolitti\"&gt;Giovanni Giolitti&lt;/a&gt; joined forces in the &lt;a href=\"Liberals%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Liberal Union&lt;/a&gt; and in 1922 the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Liberal%20Party\"&gt;Italian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; was formed. In that period, other liberal parties emerged: the &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Constitutional Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Democratic Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; (merger of the Radicals with other liberal groups), and the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Social%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Italian Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Mussolini\"&gt;Benito Mussolini&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"National%20Fascist%20Party\"&gt;National Fascist Party&lt;/a&gt; came to power in 1922, some Liberals and Radicals flirted with Fascism, but, ultimately, a &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Fascism\"&gt;Fascist&lt;/a&gt; regime was established and all the parties, notably including the Italian Liberal Party and the Italian Republican Party, were banned.\nAfter the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, both Liberals and Republicans reorganised themselves, followed by more liberal parties in the upcoming decades (notably including the new &lt;a href=\"Radical%20Party%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Radical Party&lt;/a&gt;), and, despite their modest results in elections, they were often part of the Italian government, in alliance with &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democracy%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Christian Democracy&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1940s, during the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20resistance%20movement\"&gt;resistance movement&lt;/a&gt; and the writing of the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Italy\"&gt;republican Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, an important role was played by the &lt;a href=\"Action%20Party%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Action Party&lt;/a&gt;, a social-liberal, republican and &lt;a href=\"liberal%20socialism\"&gt;liberal-socialist&lt;/a&gt; outfit, successor of the &lt;a href=\"Giustizia%20e%20Libert%C3%A0\"&gt;Justice and Freedom&lt;/a&gt; movement. In this phase the Liberals adhered to &lt;a href=\"conservative%20liberalism\"&gt;conservative liberalism&lt;/a&gt; and Republicans to &lt;a href=\"social%20liberalism\"&gt;social liberalism&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 1992\u20131994, following the \"Tangentopoli\" scandals, the subsequent \"&lt;a href=\"Mani%20pulite\"&gt;Mani pulite&lt;/a&gt;\" inquiries and the resulting shake-up of the Italian party system, the liberal movement has been strongly divided. As a result, a broad group of parties, not all included here, started to use the \"liberal\" label.\nItalian liberals are basically divided between the centre-right &lt;a href=\"Forza%20Italia%20%282013%29\"&gt;Forza Italia&lt;/a&gt; (successor of the former &lt;a href=\"Forza%20Italia\"&gt;Forza Italia&lt;/a&gt;, itself primarily a merger of liberal and Christian-democratic forces, and &lt;a href=\"The%20People%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;The People of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, which integrated the more conservative &lt;a href=\"National%20Alliance%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;National Alliance&lt;/a&gt;) and the centre-left &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (a merger of social democrats, progressive Christian democrats and social liberals, the latter two mainly organised in &lt;a href=\"Democracy%20is%20Freedom%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Daisy\"&gt;Democracy is Freedom \u2013 The Daisy&lt;/a&gt; in the early 2000s).\nMinor liberal parties include, among others, &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Choice\"&gt;Civic Choice&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Radicals\"&gt;Italian Radicals&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats%20for%20Europe%20Party\"&gt;ALDE Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20International\"&gt;Liberal International&lt;/a&gt; member), the aforementioned Italian Republican Party (which stretched a long way from the far-left to the centre-right of the &lt;a href=\"political%20spectrum\"&gt;political spectrum&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Act%20to%20Stop%20the%20Decline\"&gt;Act to Stop the Decline&lt;/a&gt; (a party which is the standard-bearer of a more &lt;a href=\"classical%20liberalism\"&gt;classical&lt;/a&gt;- and &lt;a href=\"libertarianism\"&gt;libertarian&lt;/a&gt;-oriented form of liberalism). Also the centrist-populist &lt;a href=\"Italy%20of%20Values\"&gt;Italy of Values&lt;/a&gt; was a member of the ALDE Party, but it is hardly a liberal party.\nFrom 1994 on, most Liberals and several Republicans joined Forza Italia and the other parties of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Freedoms\"&gt;House of Freedoms&lt;/a&gt; coalition. This is the reason why the term \"liberal\" is more often used when speaking of the centre-right than the centre-left. A new &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Liberal%20Party%20%281997%29\"&gt;Italian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; was launched in 1997, but, as the Italian Republican Party, it survives as a very minor party. The former two, Civic Choice, Act to Stop the Decline and minor groups joined forces in &lt;a href=\"European%20Choice\"&gt;European Choice&lt;/a&gt;, with disappointing results, in 2014."
