    "text": " was a &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"miko\"&gt;shrine maiden&lt;/a&gt; who is believed to have invented the theatrical art form of &lt;a href=\"kabuki\"&gt;kabuki&lt;/a&gt;. She is thought to have begun performing her new art style of (lit., \"the art of singing and dancing\") theatre in the dry &lt;a href=\"stream%20bed\"&gt;riverbed&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kamo%20River\"&gt;Kamo River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kyoto\"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;. Okuni's troupe quickly gained immense popularity, and were known for their performers, who were often lower-class women Okuni had recruited to act in her all-female theatre group.\nFew concrete details are known about her life; born near &lt;a href=\"Izumo%20Province\"&gt;Izumo Province&lt;/a&gt;, Okuni worked as a (shrine maiden) for several years at the &lt;a href=\"Izumo-taisha\"&gt;Izumo-taisha&lt;/a&gt; (the Grand Shrine of Izumo) until gaining popularity for her dramatised dance performances, which onlookers gave the name of . Okuni continued to perform kabuki with her troupe until her retirement and disappearance sometime around 1610. She is believed to have died sometime around 1613.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nBorn , Okuni grew up in the vicinity of the Izumo shrine, where her father, Nakamura Sanemon, worked as a &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, and where several other family members served. Eventually Okuni joined as a (shrine maiden), where she was known for her skill in dancing and acting, as well as her beauty. As it was a custom of the time to send priests, and others to solicit contributions for the shrine, she was sent to Kyoto to perform sacred dances and songs.\nIt was during her performances in Kyoto that she also became known for her performances of (or dance) in honor of the &lt;a href=\"Amitabha\"&gt;Amida Buddha&lt;/a&gt;. Though this dance traces its origins to K\u016bya, a 10th-century evangelist of &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Land%20Buddhism\"&gt;Pure Land Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, by Okuni's time it had become a largely secular &lt;a href=\"folk%20dance\"&gt;folk dance&lt;/a&gt;, and her particular adaptation tended to be known for its sultriness and &lt;a href=\"Innuendo\"&gt;sexual innuendo&lt;/a&gt;. Other popular themes for Okuni's acts included humorous skits about lover's trysts at various public establishments and meetings between men and prostitutes. Between these and other dances and acts, she garnered much attention and began to draw large crowds wherever she performed. Eventually she was summoned to return to the shrine, a call she ignored, though she continued to send money back.\nFounding of kabuki.\nAround 1603, Okuni began performing on the dry riverbed of the Shij\u014dgawara (Fourth Street Dry Riverbed) of the Kamo River and at Kitano Shrine. Okuni also performed for the ladies of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Court%20in%20Kyoto\"&gt;Imperial court&lt;/a&gt;. Gathering up the female outcasts and misfits of the region, particularly those involved in prostitution, Okuni gave them direction, teaching them acting, dancing and singing skills in order to form her troupe. \nSeveral theories exist as to the etymology of the word \"kabuki\", one being that it is derived from those who, oddly dressed and swaggering on the street, had been dubbed (from , \"to lean in a certain direction\", and , \"people\"). Another possible origin is , which means \"slanted\" or \"strongly-inclined.\" In either case, others labelled Okuni's troupe performances \"kabuki\" due to their eccentricity and social daring. The earliest performances of kabuki were dancing and song with no significant plot, often disdained as overly sexual and &lt;a href=\"cacophony\"&gt;cacophonous&lt;/a&gt;, but equally lauded as colourful and beautiful.\nOkuni's troupe was exclusively female. Thus, she required her actresses to play both male and female roles. As her troupe gained fame, she was emulated by many others, particularly &lt;a href=\"brothel\"&gt;brothel&lt;/a&gt;s, which offered such shows to amuse wealthy clients, as well as to gain &lt;a href=\"prostitution\"&gt;prostitutes&lt;/a&gt; who had marketable acting and singing skills. This new style of exclusively female troupes became known by the alternative names of and , (from , the Japanese word for \"woman\" or \"girl\") and .\nLater years.\nOne of Okuni's most popular performances featured the romantic character of Nagoya Sansabur\u014d, a real-life samurai who had died in 1603. Onstage, Okuni's beautiful voice lured Sansabur\u014d's spirit back into the world of the living to dance with her. Despite historical speculation about the possible links between Okuni and Sansabur\u014d, it remains uncertain whether the pair had ever been lovers during his lifetime, or whether she had simply incorporated him into her storytelling.\nOkuni retired around 1610, and after that time she disappeared. In 1629, due to outcry for moral reform and concern about fights breaking out between men trying to win the attention of the actresses, &lt;a href=\"Tokugawa%20Iemitsu\"&gt;Tokugawa Iemitsu&lt;/a&gt; forbade women from performing in kabuki. They were quickly replaced by young men as actors and \"actresses\", though this was soon banned as well due to some of the same issues of prostitution and corruption of morals, restricting the performances to those by older men, which is a standing practice in the official theatres even today.\nThere are several conflicting theories of Okuni's year of death; some say she died in 1610, others in 1613, or in 1640.\nCultural impact and legacy.\nIn addition to her founding of kabuki, Okuni contributed to Japanese theatre as a whole. She is said to have introduced the forerunner of the (path of flowers), a runway leading from the rear of the theatre and crossing between the audience to the stage. This has been incorporated in several Japanese theatre arts beyond that of kabuki. In addition, she has also influenced modern musical theatre.\n&lt;a href=\"Ariyoshi%20Sawako\"&gt;Ariyoshi Sawako&lt;/a&gt; published her novel in the late 1960s, crafting a fictional biography of the dancer. The story was first printed as a &lt;a href=\"Serial%20%28literature%29\"&gt;serial&lt;/a&gt; in from 1967 to 1969.\nA commemorative statue of Izumo no Okuni is located in Kyoto by the &lt;a href=\"Kamo%20River\"&gt;Kamo River&lt;/a&gt;, not far from the &lt;a href=\"Minami-za\"&gt;Minami-za&lt;/a&gt; kabuki theatre."
