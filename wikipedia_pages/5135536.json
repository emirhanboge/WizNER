    "text": "Arlington Municipal Airport is a public &lt;a href=\"airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; located three miles (5\u00a0km) southwest of the &lt;a href=\"central%20business%20district\"&gt;central business district&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arlington%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Arlington&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Snohomish%20County%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Snohomish County, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. It is owned and operated by the City of Arlington.\nIt is included in the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Aviation%20Administration\"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FAA) &lt;a href=\"National%20Plan%20of%20Integrated%20Airport%20Systems\"&gt;National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems&lt;/a&gt; for 2017\u20132021, in which it is &lt;a href=\"FAA%20airport%20categories\"&gt;categorized&lt;/a&gt; as a regional &lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt; facility.\nHistory.\nConstruction of Arlington Municipal Airport was approved on February 23, 1934. The first &lt;a href=\"airplane\"&gt;airplane&lt;/a&gt; took off on June 13, 1934, and the airport was officially dedicated on July 4, 1935.\n&lt;a href=\"Naval%20Air%20Station\"&gt;U.S. Naval Auxiliary Air Station, Arlington, Washington&lt;/a&gt;, was established in 1940, when the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; leased the airstrip from the town of Arlington to supplement training facilities at &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;. However, no important construction took place until 1942. In that year the Navy permitted the Army to develop the field as a strategic base for medium &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt;s to counteract the &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;a href=\"invasion\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Aleutian%20Islands\"&gt;Aleutian Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Early in 1943 the Japanese threat in the Aleutians diminished and at the same time the Naval &lt;a href=\"Aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;carrier&lt;/a&gt; program required additional training fields within reach of gunnery ranges in the &lt;a href=\"Puget%20Sound\"&gt;Puget Sound&lt;/a&gt; area. By August 14, 1945, Arlington was a well-balanced station equipped to support two light carrier Air groups for either day or night operations. No major projects were pending at that time, and it was felt that none remained to be undertaken unless a significant addition was made to the functions of the station.\nAt the close of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20armed%20forces\"&gt;U.S. military&lt;/a&gt; reduced funding and operations around the United States. On October 10, 1945, notification was received from the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations\"&gt;Chief of Naval Operations&lt;/a&gt; that Arlington would be reduced to a &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Acaretaker\"&gt;caretaker status&lt;/a&gt; on December 1, 1945.\nThe airfield and hangar complex has been listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; since 1995.\nToday.\nCurrently, the airport is host to several &lt;a href=\"businesses\"&gt;businesses&lt;/a&gt; making significant contributions to the &lt;a href=\"aviation\"&gt;aviation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Industry%20%28economics%29\"&gt;industry&lt;/a&gt;. Some activities include &lt;a href=\"flight%20instruction\"&gt;flight instruction&lt;/a&gt;, emergency &lt;a href=\"parachute\"&gt;parachute&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"manufacturing\"&gt;manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Homebuilt%20aircraft\"&gt;kit plane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sailplane\"&gt;sailplane&lt;/a&gt; sales/manufacturing, historic and decommissioned &lt;a href=\"aircraft\"&gt;aircraft&lt;/a&gt; restoration, aircraft upholstery, aircraft cover manufacturing, and much more. The airport is home to &lt;a href=\"Business%20jet\"&gt;corporate&lt;/a&gt; &amp; decommissioned &lt;a href=\"Military%20aircraft\"&gt;military jets&lt;/a&gt;, vintage aircraft, &lt;a href=\"experimental%20aircraft\"&gt;experimental aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"aerobatic%20aircraft\"&gt;aerobatic aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Glider%20%28sailplane%29\"&gt;gliders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ultralight%20aviation\"&gt;ultralights&lt;/a&gt;. The grassroots aviation presence at Arlington is very strong, rivaling that of many larger airports across the United States, including nearby &lt;a href=\"Paine%20Field\"&gt;Paine Field&lt;/a&gt; (KPAE).\nThe City continues to support &lt;a href=\"general%20aviation\"&gt;general aviation&lt;/a&gt; through financing, planning and development. During the 1995 Master Plan update, the City planned and developed the airport specifically for general aviation use. Items specific to general aviation included in the 2002 Master Plan Update were additional &lt;a href=\"T-hangar\"&gt;T-hangar&lt;/a&gt;s, a 100' by 1,000' (50' pavement / 50' turf) ultralight &lt;a href=\"runway\"&gt;runway&lt;/a&gt;, and a compass rose. There are approximately 580 aircraft based at the airport, which has 400 public hangars and 77 private hangars.\nIn the 1990s, the airport was selected by the &lt;a href=\"Puget%20Sound%20Regional%20Council\"&gt;Puget Sound Regional Council&lt;/a&gt; as a candidate for expansion into a &lt;a href=\"regional%20airport\"&gt;regional airport&lt;/a&gt; to relieve &lt;a href=\"Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The council decided instead to construct a third runway at Sea-Tac in 1996, leaving Arlington to redevelop its airport for general aviation. A business park was created on the west side of the airport in 2002 and includes offices, hangars, and light manufacturing. In 2019, the city began lobbying for a runway extension to support larger airplanes and anticipated growth.\nFrom 2009 to 2014, the airport was home to the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20State%20Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;Washington State Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt;'s Aviation Division.\nIn April 2014, the airport saw the arrival of President &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Marine%20One\"&gt;Marine One&lt;/a&gt;, the presidential helicopter, after flying from &lt;a href=\"Paine%20Field\"&gt;Paine Field&lt;/a&gt; in Everett. The President then continued by motorcade to &lt;a href=\"Oso%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Oso&lt;/a&gt;, scene of a &lt;a href=\"Oso%20mudslide\"&gt;fatal mudslide&lt;/a&gt;.\nFacilities and aircraft.\nArlington Municipal Airport covers an &lt;a href=\"area\"&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; of which contains two &lt;a href=\"asphalt\"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt; paved runways: 16/34 measuring 5,332 x 100\u00a0ft (1,625 x 30 m) and 11/29 measuring 3,498 x 75\u00a0ft (1,066 x 23 m). A third paved runway on the north of the airport is abandoned. The airport also maintains three unmarked turf runways for used by gliders and ultralight aircraft.\nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2015, the airport had 133,492 aircraft operations, an average of 365 per day: 98% general aviation, 2% &lt;a href=\"air%20taxi\"&gt;air taxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;1% military. In July 2017, there were 513 aircraft based at Arlington: 366 single-engine, 19 multi-engine, 11 &lt;a href=\"jet%20aircraft\"&gt;jet&lt;/a&gt;, 12 helicopter, 45 glider and 60 ultralight."
