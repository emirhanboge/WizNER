    "text": "CYJO , born Cindy Hwang (1974),is an American &lt;a href=\"Fine-art%20photography\"&gt;Fine-art&lt;/a&gt; photographer. She is known for her photographic and textual projects, such as Substructure and KYOPO Project.\nLife and career.\nCYJO was born in Seoul, Korea, and immigrated to the US in 1975. She attended &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20College%20Park\"&gt;University of Maryland, College Park&lt;/a&gt;, Instituto Politecnico Internazionale Della Moda, in Italy, and graduated magna cum laude at &lt;a href=\"Fashion%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Fashion Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;, in New York City.\nCYJO is the creator of the KYOPO Project, its name a reference to the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20diaspora\"&gt;Korean diaspora&lt;/a&gt;. Her biography states, \"KYOPO Project is a photographic and textual project about immigration and identity through the &lt;a href=\"lens%20%28optics%29\"&gt;lens&lt;/a&gt; of the Korean ancestry. Over 200 people, mostly living in America, explore their relationships with their ancestral culture and the other cultures they embody through citizenship or through life experiences.\"\nHer work has been exhibited in the US and abroad, and has been shown in museums such as the &lt;a href=\"National%20Portrait%20Gallery%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;National Portrait Gallery&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Smithsonian%20Institution\"&gt;Smithsonian Institution&lt;/a&gt;, as part of their first major showcase of contemporary Asian American portraiture. About KYOPO Project, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote, \"the pictures have the slickness of a fashion shoot, but the texts reveal hidden depth and complexity\". &lt;a href=\"Smithsonian%20Magazine\"&gt;Smithsonian Magazine&lt;/a&gt; wrote, \"CYJO\u2019s images are wonderfully unencumbered: she uses her lens to convey straight-forward stories of the constructed \u201cself\u201d\u2014here we are, the images tell us, in our stance as contemporary Korean Americans. Change may constantly skim the surface of modern life, but KYOPO reveals something lasting beneath\". CYJO's Substructure is a collection of photos documenting the hands of 50 Chinese migrant workers. In the summer of 2010, CYJO traveled to three different migrant centers with the goal of providing \"an educational platform\" to increase awareness of the difficulties experienced by the migrants. CYJO focused on the hands as both an expressive tool and anonymous means of sharing these migrant voices.\nMajor works.\n\"The KYOPO Project\" (2004\u20132010).\nThe KYOPO Project is a photographic and textual project that explores identity and immigration through the lens of the Korean ancestry. The KYOPO Project dissects over 230 kyopo (people of Korean ethnicity living outside the Korean peninsula). KYOPO is a forced collective of individuals that challenges the idea of a monolithic Korean and investigates what it means to be a Korean and American. Relationships with ancestry, their culture of citizenship and other cultures they embody are expressed explaining a constantly evolving identity. Issues discussed in the KYOPO Project include adoption, generational issues, Asians in politics &amp; arts, \u201cmixed\u201d kyopo and the global identity.\nKYOPO, the publication, published by Umbrage Editions, features 237 photos and interviews with a foreword by writer and lecturer of ethnic studies Marie Myung Ok Lee and introduction by art critic and academic &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Stallabrass\"&gt;Julian Stallabrass&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Substructure\" (2010).\nSubstructure is a photographic, textual and video project on the global topic of migration profiling 50 migrants residing in Beijing. Aged 5\u201380, these individuals from varying provinces including Henan, Shandong and Anhui talk about their journeys for a better life and a developing China. Their portraits are photographed and videotaped anonymously through their hands where the detailed print of the photo contrasts the raw kinesthetic gestures in video. Substructure was created in collaboration with an NGO, Compassion for Migrant Children (CMC)."
