    "title": "Dutch Colonial architecture (New Netherland)",
    "text": "Dutch colonial architecture is the type of architecture prevalent in the construction of homes, commercial buildings, and outbuildings in areas settled by the Dutch from the early 17th to early 19th century in the area encompassing the former Dutch colony of &lt;a href=\"New%20Netherland\"&gt;New Netherland&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early 17th century, the original portion of most dwellings started out, as a matter of immediate need, as simple one-story dwellings constructed primarily of local available material. When available the house would be constructed of fieldstone such as the &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Manee%20House\"&gt;Abraham Manee House&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Staten%20Island\"&gt;Staten Island&lt;/a&gt;. The wood for the &lt;a href=\"joist\"&gt;joist&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"rafter\"&gt;rafter&lt;/a&gt;s were trimmed with an &lt;a href=\"adze\"&gt;adze&lt;/a&gt; from trees felled on or near the property.\nThe ceiling and interior walls when constructed after the initial construction were usually framed then plastered with clay from local deposits, mixed with horse hair for strength, over rough trimmed &lt;a href=\"Lath%20and%20plaster\"&gt;wood laths&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommon characteristics of Dutch colonial architecture are they typically, but not always had &lt;a href=\"Gambrel%20roof\"&gt;Gambrel roof&lt;/a&gt;s with flared &lt;a href=\"eaves\"&gt;eaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20door\"&gt;Dutch door&lt;/a&gt;s and brick chimneys built at the &lt;a href=\"gable\"&gt;gable&lt;/a&gt; ends."
