    "text": "Naive set theory is any of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the &lt;a href=\"foundations%20of%20mathematics\"&gt;foundations of mathematics&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Set%20theory%23Axiomatic%20set%20theory\"&gt;axiomatic set theories&lt;/a&gt;, which are defined using &lt;a href=\"Mathematical_logic%23Formal_logical_systems\"&gt;formal logic&lt;/a&gt;, naive set theory is defined informally, in &lt;a href=\"natural%20language\"&gt;natural language&lt;/a&gt;. It describes the aspects of &lt;a href=\"Set%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;mathematical sets&lt;/a&gt; familiar in &lt;a href=\"discrete%20mathematics\"&gt;discrete mathematics&lt;/a&gt; (for example &lt;a href=\"Venn%20diagram\"&gt;Venn diagram&lt;/a&gt;s and symbolic reasoning about their &lt;a href=\"Boolean%20algebra%20%28logic%29\"&gt;Boolean algebra&lt;/a&gt;), and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.\nSets are of great importance in mathematics; in modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects (&lt;a href=\"number\"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"relation%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;relations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"function%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;functions&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) are defined in terms of sets. Naive set theory suffices for many purposes, while also serving as a stepping-stone towards more formal treatments.\nMethod.\nA \"naive theory\" in the sense of \"naive set theory\" is a non-formalized theory, that is, a theory that uses &lt;a href=\"natural%20language\"&gt;natural language&lt;/a&gt; to describe sets and operations on sets. The words \"and\", \"or\", \"if ... then\", \"not\", \"for some\", \"for every\" are treated as in ordinary mathematics. As a matter of convenience, use of naive set theory and its formalism prevails even in higher mathematics \u2013 including in more formal settings of set theory itself.\nThe first development of &lt;a href=\"set%20theory\"&gt;set theory&lt;/a&gt; was a naive set theory. It was created at the end of the 19th\u00a0century by &lt;a href=\"Georg%20Cantor\"&gt;Georg Cantor&lt;/a&gt; as part of his study of &lt;a href=\"infinite%20set\"&gt;infinite set&lt;/a&gt;s and developed by &lt;a href=\"Gottlob%20Frege\"&gt;Gottlob Frege&lt;/a&gt; in his \"Grundgesetze der Arithmetik\".\nNaive set theory may refer to several very distinct notions. It may refer to\nParadoxes.\nThe assumption that any property may be used to form a set, without restriction, leads to &lt;a href=\"paradox\"&gt;paradox&lt;/a&gt;es. One common example is &lt;a href=\"Russell%27s%20paradox\"&gt;Russell's paradox&lt;/a&gt;: there is no set consisting of \"all sets that do not contain themselves\". Thus consistent systems of naive set theory must include some limitations on the principles which can be used to form sets.\nCantor's theory.\nSome believe that &lt;a href=\"Georg%20Cantor\"&gt;Georg Cantor&lt;/a&gt;'s set theory was not actually implicated in the set-theoretic paradoxes (see Fr\u00e1polli 1991). One difficulty in determining this with certainty is that Cantor did not provide an axiomatization of his system. By 1899, Cantor was aware of some of the paradoxes following from unrestricted interpretation of his theory, for instance &lt;a href=\"Cantor%27s%20paradox\"&gt;Cantor's paradox&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burali-Forti%20paradox\"&gt;Burali-Forti paradox&lt;/a&gt;, and did not believe that they discredited his theory. Cantor's paradox can actually be derived from the above (false) assumption\u2014that any property may be used to form a set\u2014using for \" is a &lt;a href=\"cardinal%20number\"&gt;cardinal number&lt;/a&gt;\". Frege explicitly axiomatized a theory in which a formalized version of naive set theory can be interpreted, and it is \"this\" formal theory which &lt;a href=\"Bertrand%20Russell\"&gt;Bertrand Russell&lt;/a&gt; actually addressed when he presented his paradox, not necessarily a theory Cantorwho, as mentioned, was aware of several paradoxespresumably had in mind.\nAxiomatic theories.\nAxiomatic set theory was developed in response to these early attempts to understand sets, with the goal of determining precisely what operations were allowed and when.\nConsistency.\nA naive set theory is not \"necessarily\" inconsistent, if it correctly specifies the sets allowed to be considered. This can be done by the means of definitions, which are implicit axioms. It is possible to state all the axioms explicitly, as in the case of Halmos' \"Naive Set Theory\", which is actually an informal presentation of the usual axiomatic &lt;a href=\"Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel%20set%20theory\"&gt;Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory&lt;/a&gt;. It is \"naive\" in that the language and notations are those of ordinary informal mathematics, and in that it does not deal with consistency or completeness of the axiom system.\nLikewise, an axiomatic set theory is not necessarily consistent: not necessarily free of paradoxes. It follows from &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6del%27s%20incompleteness%20theorems\"&gt;G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems&lt;/a&gt; that a sufficiently complicated &lt;a href=\"first%20order%20logic\"&gt;first order logic&lt;/a&gt; system (which includes most common axiomatic set theories) cannot be proved consistent from within the theory itself \u2013 even if it actually is consistent. However, the common axiomatic systems are generally believed to be consistent; by their axioms they do exclude \"some\" paradoxes, like &lt;a href=\"Russell%27s%20paradox\"&gt;Russell's paradox&lt;/a&gt;. Based on &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6del%27s%20incompleteness%20theorems\"&gt;G\u00f6del's theorem&lt;/a&gt;, it is just not known \u2013 and never can be \u2013 if there are \"no\" paradoxes at all in these theories or in any first-order set theory.\nThe term \"naive set theory\" is still today also used in some literature to refer to the set theories studied by Frege and Cantor, rather than to the informal counterparts of modern axiomatic set theory.\nUtility.\nThe choice between an axiomatic approach and other approaches is largely a matter of convenience. In everyday mathematics the best choice may be informal use of axiomatic set theory. References to particular axioms typically then occur only when demanded by tradition, e.g. the &lt;a href=\"axiom%20of%20choice\"&gt;axiom of choice&lt;/a&gt; is often mentioned when used. Likewise, formal proofs occur only when warranted by exceptional circumstances. This informal usage of axiomatic set theory can have (depending on notation) precisely the \"appearance\" of naive set theory as outlined below. It is considerably easier to read and write (in the formulation of most statements, proofs, and lines of discussion) and is less error-prone than a strictly formal approach.\nSets, membership and equality.\nIn naive set theory, a set is described as a well-defined collection of objects. These objects are called the elements or members of the set. Objects can be anything: numbers, people, other sets, etc. For instance, 4 is a member of the set of all even &lt;a href=\"integer\"&gt;integer&lt;/a&gt;s. Clearly, the set of even numbers is infinitely large; there is no requirement that a set be finite.\nThe definition of sets goes back to &lt;a href=\"Georg%20Cantor\"&gt;Georg Cantor&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote in his 1915 article \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20141020034245/http%3A//gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php%3Fid%3Dpdf%26amp%3Bno_cache%3D1%26amp%3BIDDOC%3D36218\"&gt;Beitr\u00e4ge zur Begr\u00fcndung der transfiniten Mengenlehre&lt;/a&gt;\":\n\u201cUnter einer 'Menge' verstehen wir jede Zusammenfassung M von bestimmten wohlunterschiedenen Objekten unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens (welche die 'Elemente' von M genannt werden) zu einem Ganzen.\u201d \u2013 Georg Cantor\n\u201cA set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our thought\u2014which are called elements of the set.\u201d \u2013 Georg Cantor\nNote on consistency.\nIt does \"not\" follow from this definition \"how\" sets can be formed, and what operations on sets again will produce a set. The term \"well-defined\" in \"well-defined collection of objects\" cannot, by itself, guarantee the consistency and unambiguity of what exactly constitutes and what does not constitute a set. Attempting to achieve this would be the realm of axiomatic set theory or of axiomatic class theory.\nThe problem, in this context, with informally formulated set theories, not derived from (and implying) any particular axiomatic theory, is that there may be several widely differing formalized versions, that have both different sets and different rules for how new sets may be formed, that all conform to the original informal definition. For example, Cantor's verbatim definition allows for considerable freedom in what constitutes a set. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Cantor was particularly interested in sets containing cats and dogs, but rather only in sets containing purely mathematical objects. An example of such a class of sets could be the &lt;a href=\"von%20Neumann%20universe\"&gt;von Neumann universe&lt;/a&gt;. But even when fixing the class of sets under consideration, it is not always clear which rules for set formation are allowed without introducing paradoxes.\nFor the purpose of fixing the discussion below, the term \"well-defined\" should instead be interpreted as an \"intention\", with either implicit or explicit rules (axioms or definitions), to rule out inconsistencies. The purpose is to keep the often deep and difficult issues of consistency away from the, usually simpler, context at hand. An explicit ruling out of \"all\" conceivable inconsistencies (paradoxes) cannot be achieved for an axiomatic set theory anyway, due to G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem, so this does not at all hamper the utility of naive set theory as compared to axiomatic set theory in the simple contexts considered below. It merely simplifies the discussion. Consistency is henceforth taken for granted unless explicitly mentioned.\nMembership.\nIf \"x\" is a member of a set \"A\", then it is also said that \"x\" belongs to \"A\", or that \"x\" is in \"A\". This is denoted by \"x\"\u00a0\u2208\u00a0\"A\". The symbol \u2208 is a derivation from the lowercase Greek letter &lt;a href=\"epsilon\"&gt;epsilon&lt;/a&gt;, \"\u03b5\", introduced by &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Peano\"&gt;Giuseppe Peano&lt;/a&gt; in 1889 and is the first letter of the word &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%25E1%25BC%2590%25CF%2583%25CF%2584%25CE%25AF\"&gt;\u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af&lt;/a&gt; (means \"is\"). The symbol \u2209 is often used to write \"x\"\u00a0\u2209\u00a0\"A\", meaning \"x is not in A\".\nEquality.\nTwo sets \"A\" and \"B\" are defined to be &lt;a href=\"Equality%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;equal&lt;/a&gt; when they have precisely the same elements, that is, if every element of \"A\" is an element of \"B\" and every element of \"B\" is an element of \"A\". (See &lt;a href=\"axiom%20of%20extensionality\"&gt;axiom of extensionality&lt;/a&gt;.) Thus a set is completely determined by its elements; the description is immaterial. For example, the set with elements 2, 3, and 5 is equal to the set of all &lt;a href=\"prime%20number\"&gt;prime number&lt;/a&gt;s less than 6.\nIf the sets \"A\" and \"B\" are equal, this is denoted symbolically as \"A\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"B\" (as usual).\nEmpty set.\nThe &lt;a href=\"empty%20set\"&gt;empty set&lt;/a&gt;, often denoted \u00d8 and sometimes formula_1, is a set with no members at all. Because a set is determined completely by its elements, there can be only one empty set. (See &lt;a href=\"axiom%20of%20empty%20set\"&gt;axiom of empty set&lt;/a&gt;.) Although the empty set has no members, it can be a member of other sets. Thus \u00d8 \u2260 {\u00d8}, because the former has no members and the latter has one member. In mathematics, the only sets with which one needs to be concerned can be built up from the empty set alone.\nSpecifying sets.\nThe simplest way to describe a set is to list its elements between curly braces (known as defining a set \"extensionally\"). Thus denotes the set whose only elements are and .\nNote the following points:\nThis notation can be informally abused by saying something like to indicate the set of all dogs, but this example would usually be read by mathematicians as \"the set containing the single element \"dogs\"\".\nAn extreme (but correct) example of this notation is , which denotes the empty set.\nThe notation , or sometimes , is used to denote the set containing all objects for which the condition holds (known as defining a set \"intensionally\").\nFor example, denotes the set of &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real number&lt;/a&gt;s, denotes the set of everything with blonde hair.\nThis notation is called &lt;a href=\"set-builder%20notation\"&gt;set-builder notation&lt;/a&gt; (or \"set comprehension\", particularly in the context of &lt;a href=\"Functional%20programming\"&gt;Functional programming&lt;/a&gt;).\nSome variants of set builder notation are:\nSubsets.\nGiven two sets \"A\" and \"B\", \"A\" is a &lt;a href=\"subset\"&gt;subset&lt;/a&gt; of \"B\" if every element of \"A\" is also an element of \"B\".\nIn particular, each set \"B\" is a subset of itself; a subset of \"B\" that is not equal to \"B\" is called a proper subset.\nIf \"A\" is a subset of \"B\", then one can also say that \"B\" is a superset of \"A\", that \"A\" is contained in \"B\", or that \"B\" contains \"A\". In symbols, \"A\"\u00a0\u2286\u00a0\"B\" means that \"A\" is a subset of \"B\", and \"B\"\u00a0\u2287\u00a0\"A\" means that \"B\" is a superset of \"A\".\nSome authors use the symbols \u2282 and \u2283 for subsets, and others use these symbols only for \"proper\" subsets. For clarity, one can explicitly use the symbols \u228a and \u228b to indicate non-equality.\nAs an illustration, let R be the set of real numbers, let Z be the set of integers, let \"O\" be the set of odd integers, and let \"P\" be the set of current or former &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U.S. Presidents&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen \"O\" is a subset of Z, Z is a subset of R, and (hence) \"O\" is a subset of R, where in all cases \"subset\" may even be read as \"proper subset\".\nNot all sets are comparable in this way. For example, it is not the case either that R is a subset of \"P\" nor that \"P\" is a subset of R.\nIt follows immediately from the definition of equality of sets above that, given two sets \"A\" and \"B\", \"A\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"B\" if and only if \"A\"\u00a0\u2286\u00a0\"B\" and \"B\"\u00a0\u2286\u00a0\"A\". In fact this is often given as the definition of equality. Usually when trying to &lt;a href=\"mathematical%20proof\"&gt;prove&lt;/a&gt; that two sets are equal, one aims to show these two inclusions. The &lt;a href=\"empty%20set\"&gt;empty set&lt;/a&gt; is a subset of every set (the statement that all elements of the empty set are also members of any set \"A\" is &lt;a href=\"vacuously%20true\"&gt;vacuously true&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe set of all subsets of a given set \"A\" is called the &lt;a href=\"power%20set\"&gt;power set&lt;/a&gt; of \"A\" and is denoted by formula_2 or formula_3; the \"P\" is sometimes in a &lt;a href=\"Script%20%28typefaces%29\"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; font. If the set \"A\" has \"n\" elements, then formula_3 will have formula_5 elements.\nUniversal sets and absolute complements.\nIn certain contexts, one may consider all sets under consideration as being subsets of some given &lt;a href=\"universe%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;universal set&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor instance, when investigating properties of the &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real number&lt;/a&gt;s R (and subsets of R), R may be taken as the universal set. A true universal set is not included in standard set theory (see &lt;a href=\"%23Paradoxes\"&gt;Paradoxes&lt;/a&gt; below), but is included in some non-standard set theories.\nGiven a universal set U and a subset \"A\" of U, the &lt;a href=\"complement%20%28set%20theory%29\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; of \"A\" (in U) is defined as\nIn other words, \"A\"C (\"\"A-complement\"; sometimes simply \"A, \"A-prime\"\" ) is the set of all members of U\"' which are not members of \"A\".\nThus with R, Z and \"O\" defined as in the section on subsets, if Z is the universal set, then \"OC\" is the set of even integers, while if R is the universal set, then \"OC\" is the set of all real numbers that are either even integers or not integers at all.\nUnions, intersections, and relative complements.\nGiven two sets \"A\" and \"B\", their &lt;a href=\"union%20%28set%20theory%29\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt; is the set consisting of all objects which are elements of \"A\" or of \"B\" or of both (see &lt;a href=\"axiom%20of%20union\"&gt;axiom of union&lt;/a&gt;). It is denoted by \"A\"\u00a0\u222a\u00a0\"B\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"intersection%20%28set%20theory%29\"&gt;intersection&lt;/a&gt; of \"A\" and \"B\" is the set of all objects which are both in \"A\" and in \"B\". It is denoted by \"A\"\u00a0\u2229\u00a0\"B\".\nFinally, the &lt;a href=\"complement%20%28set%20theory%29\"&gt;relative complement&lt;/a&gt; of \"B\" relative to \"A\", also known as the set theoretic difference of \"A\" and \"B\", is the set of all objects that belong to \"A\" but \"not\" to \"B\". It is written as \"A\"\u00a0\\\u00a0\"B\" or \"A\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"B\".\nSymbolically, these are respectively\nThe set \"B\" doesn't have to be a subset of \"A\" for \"A\"\u00a0\\\u00a0\"B\" to make sense; this is the difference between the relative complement and the absolute complement (\"A\"C = \"U\"\u00a0\\\u00a0\"A\") from the previous section.\nTo illustrate these ideas, let \"A\" be the set of left-handed people, and let \"B\" be the set of people with blond hair. Then \"A\"\u00a0\u2229\u00a0\"B\" is the set of all left-handed blond-haired people, while \"A\"\u00a0\u222a\u00a0\"B\" is the set of all people who are left-handed or blond-haired or both. \"A\"\u00a0\\\u00a0\"B\", on the other hand, is the set of all people that are left-handed but not blond-haired, while \"B\"\u00a0\\\u00a0\"A\" is the set of all people who have blond hair but aren't left-handed.\nNow let \"E\" be the set of all human beings, and let \"F\" be the set of all living things over 1000 years old. What is \"E\"\u00a0\u2229\u00a0\"F\" in this case? No living human being is &lt;a href=\"Oldest%20people\"&gt;over 1000 years old&lt;/a&gt;, so \"E\"\u00a0\u2229\u00a0\"F\" must be the &lt;a href=\"empty%20set\"&gt;empty set&lt;/a&gt; {}.\nFor any set \"A\", the power set formula_3 is a &lt;a href=\"Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29\"&gt;Boolean algebra&lt;/a&gt; under the operations of union and intersection.\nOrdered pairs and Cartesian products.\nIntuitively, an &lt;a href=\"ordered%20pair\"&gt;ordered pair&lt;/a&gt; is simply a collection of two objects such that one can be distinguished as the \"first element\" and the other as the \"second element\", and having the fundamental property that, two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their \"first elements\" are equal and their \"second elements\" are equal.\nFormally, an ordered pair with first coordinate \"a\", and second coordinate \"b\", usually denoted by (\"a\", \"b\"), can be defined as the set .\nIt follows that, two ordered pairs (\"a\",\"b\") and (\"c\",\"d\") are equal if and only if \"a\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"c\" and \"b\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"d\".\nAlternatively, an ordered pair can be formally thought of as a set {a,b} with a &lt;a href=\"total%20order\"&gt;total order&lt;/a&gt;.\n(The notation (\"a\", \"b\") is also used to denote an &lt;a href=\"open%20interval\"&gt;open interval&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"real%20number%20line\"&gt;real number line&lt;/a&gt;, but the context should make it clear which meaning is intended. Otherwise, the notation ]\"a\", \"b\"[ may be used to denote the open interval whereas (\"a\", \"b\") is used for the ordered pair).\nIf \"A\" and \"B\" are sets, then the &lt;a href=\"Cartesian%20product\"&gt;Cartesian product&lt;/a&gt; (or simply product) is defined to be:\nThat is, \"A\"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"B\" is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate is an element of \"A\" and whose second coordinate is an element of \"B\".\nThis definition may be extended to a set \"A\"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"B\"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"C\" of ordered triples, and more generally to sets of ordered &lt;a href=\"n-tuple\"&gt;n-tuple&lt;/a&gt;s for any positive integer \"n\".\nIt is even possible to define infinite &lt;a href=\"Cartesian%20product\"&gt;Cartesian product&lt;/a&gt;s, but this requires a more recondite definition of the product.\nCartesian products were first developed by &lt;a href=\"Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes\"&gt;Ren\u00e9 Descartes&lt;/a&gt; in the context of &lt;a href=\"analytic%20geometry\"&gt;analytic geometry&lt;/a&gt;. If R denotes the set of all &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real number&lt;/a&gt;s, then R2\u00a0:=\u00a0R\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0R represents the &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20plane\"&gt;Euclidean plane&lt;/a&gt; and R3\u00a0:=\u00a0R\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0R\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0R represents three-dimensional &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20space\"&gt;Euclidean space&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome important sets.\nThere are some ubiquitous sets for which the notation is almost universal. Some of these are listed below. In the list, \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" refer to &lt;a href=\"natural%20number\"&gt;natural number&lt;/a&gt;s, and \"r\" and \"s\" are &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real number&lt;/a&gt;s.\nParadoxes in early set theory.\nThe unrestricted formation principle of sets referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Axiom%20schema%20of%20specification%23Unrestricted%20comprehension\"&gt;axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension&lt;/a&gt;,\nis the source of several early appearing paradoxes:\nIf the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension is weakened to the &lt;a href=\"axiom%20schema%20of%20specification\"&gt;axiom schema of specification&lt;/a&gt; or axiom schema of separation,\nthen all the above paradoxes disappear. There is a corollary. With the axiom schema of separation as an axiom of the theory, it follows, as a theorem of the theory:\nOr, more spectacularly (Halmos' phrasing): There is no &lt;a href=\"Domain%20of%20discourse\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt;. \"Proof\": Suppose that it exists and call it . Now apply the axiom schema of separation with and for use . This leads to Russell's paradox again. Hence can't exist in this theory.\nRelated to the above constructions is formation of the set\nIt is (perhaps surprisingly) not the possibility of that is problematic. It is again the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension allowing for . With the axiom schema of specification instead of unrestricted comprehension, the conclusion doesn't hold and, hence is not a logical consequence.\nNonetheless, the possibility of is often removed explicitly or, e.g. in ZFC, implicitly, by demanding the &lt;a href=\"axiom%20of%20regularity\"&gt;axiom of regularity&lt;/a&gt; to hold. One consequence of it is\nor, in other words, no set is an element of itself.\nThe axiom schema of separation is simply too weak (while unrestricted comprehension is a very strong axiom\u2014too strong for set theory) to develop set theory with its usual operations and constructions outlined above. The axiom of regularity is of a restrictive nature as well. Therefore, one is led to the formulation of other axioms to guarantee the existence of enough sets to form a set theory. Some of these have been described informally above and many others are possible. Not all conceivable axioms can be combined freely into consistent theories. For example, the &lt;a href=\"axiom%20of%20choice\"&gt;axiom of choice&lt;/a&gt; of ZFC is incompatible with the conceivable every set of reals is &lt;a href=\"Lebesgue%20measurable\"&gt;Lebesgue measurable&lt;/a&gt;. The former implies the latter is false."
