    "title": "Parties and factions in Isabelline Spain",
    "text": "There were numerous political parties and factions in Isabelline Spain (&lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Isabella%20II%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Isabella II&lt;/a&gt;, who reigned 29 September 1833 \u2013 30 September 1868). Some of them are known by multiple names, and in many cases the lines between these were fluid over time, both in terms of individuals moving from one party or faction to another and in terms of parties or factions changing their stances. Many of these factions are subgroups of parties, and groupings sometimes overlapped. Many factions (especially within the &lt;a href=\"Moderate%20Party%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Moderate Party&lt;/a&gt;) were based on little more than &lt;a href=\"political%20clientelism\"&gt;political clientelism&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarlists and Christinos.\nWhen Isabella first became queen, she was only three years old. The &lt;a href=\"queen%20mother\"&gt;queen mother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Christina%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies\"&gt;Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies&lt;/a&gt;, served as &lt;a href=\"regent\"&gt;regent&lt;/a&gt;. The first and foremost political division of the Isabeline era was between \"&lt;a href=\"Carlism\"&gt;Carlists&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Christinos\"&gt;Christinos&lt;/a&gt;\" (or \"Isabelinos\"), the former being supporters of &lt;a href=\"Infante%20Carlos%2C%20Count%20of%20Molina\"&gt;Infante Carlos, Count of Molina&lt;/a&gt;, a rival claimant to the throne and the latter being supporters of Maria Christina and Isabella. The former supported &lt;a href=\"absolute%20monarchism\"&gt;absolute monarchism&lt;/a&gt; and the traditionalism of the \"&lt;a href=\"Antiguo%20R%C3%A9gimen\"&gt;Antiguo R\u00e9gimen&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Old Regime\"); they were uniformly close to the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; Church, and generally &lt;a href=\"clericalism\"&gt;clericalist&lt;/a&gt;. The latter were generally supporters of &lt;a href=\"constitutional%20monarchy\"&gt;constitutional monarchy&lt;/a&gt; (although some, including Maria Christina herself, were more inclined toward &lt;a href=\"enlightened%20absolutism\"&gt;enlightened absolutism&lt;/a&gt;); they were &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberals&lt;/a&gt; of one stripe or another, ranging from &lt;a href=\"liberal%20conservatism\"&gt;liberal conservatives&lt;/a&gt; and those whose liberalism was &lt;a href=\"economic%20liberalism\"&gt;strictly economic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"social%20liberalism\"&gt;social liberals&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1830s, these two groups faced off in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Carlist%20War\"&gt;First Carlist War&lt;/a&gt;, which the Cristinos won. The terms of surrender\u2014notably the &lt;a href=\"Convention%20of%20Vergara\"&gt;Convention of Vergara&lt;/a&gt;\u2014left an opportunity for relatively moderate Carlists to continue to play a role in the country's politics, and many did so over the ensuing decades.\nAnother term strongly associated with the Carlist faction is \"apost\u00f3licos\", a term deriving from their strong ties to clericalism. This term actually predates \"Carlist\"; this was already the name of a faction in the time of &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20VII%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Ferdinand VII&lt;/a&gt; before they had settled on the Infante Carlos, Ferdinand's younger brother, as their champion\nPolitical parties.\nLeaving aside the Carlists, four groups within the Isabelino camp are generally considered to be political parties, although the two that came first chronologically did not have quite the formal organization that the term \"party\" may imply. These first two were the &lt;a href=\"Moderate%20Party%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Moderates&lt;/a&gt; (\"moderados\") and &lt;a href=\"Progressive%20Party%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Progressives&lt;/a&gt; (\"progresistas\"), both of them with roots going back at least to the \"&lt;a href=\"trienio%20liberal\"&gt;trienio liberal&lt;/a&gt;\" of 1820\u20131823. The latter two were the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (\"dem\u00f3cratas\", who established themselves as the Partido Progresista-Dem\u00f3crata in 1849) and the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Union%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Liberal Union&lt;/a&gt; (\"Uni\u00f3n Liberal\", formally founded 1858). In keeping with the Praetorianism that was such a factor in the Spanish politics of the time\u2014&lt;a href=\"coup\"&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt;s and coup attempts were routine\u2014the Moderates, Progressives, and Liberal Union were each closely associated with a &lt;a href=\"General%20officer\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt;, respectively &lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Narv%C3%A1ez\"&gt;Ram\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Narv\u00e1ez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baldomero%20Espartero\"&gt;Baldomero Espartero&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Leopoldo%20O%27Donnell\"&gt;Leopoldo O'Donnell&lt;/a&gt;.\nFactions.\nWithin these parties were numerous factions; as remarked above, many of these were rather fluid (as, at times, were the parties themselves). To begin with, there were the \"docea\u00f1istas\", associated with the &lt;a href=\"Cortes%20of%20C%C3%A1diz\"&gt;Cortes of C\u00e1diz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201812\"&gt;Constitution of 1812&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"veintea\u00f1istas\" or \"exaltados\", slightly younger, somewhat farther to the &lt;a href=\"left%20%28politics%29\"&gt;left&lt;/a&gt;, associated with the \"&lt;a href=\"trienio%20liberal\"&gt;trienio liberal&lt;/a&gt;\" (1820\u20131823). To a large extent, these corresponded to the Moderates and Progressives, respectively, though there were certainly exceptions. Furthermore, there were the \"afrancesados\" (\"Frenchified\"), a term that could refer to anyone associated with the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;, but especially to those who had supported the regime of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Joseph Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20War\"&gt;Peninsular War&lt;/a&gt; / War of Independence.\nAfter the moderate Maria Christina was ousted as regent in September 1840, a division arose that crossed party lines, but importantly split the Progressives. Those who wanted a three-person council of regency were known as \"trinitarios\" (\"Trinitarians\"), those who wanted a single regent as \"unitarios\" (\"Unitarians\"). The Moderates were nearly all \"unitarios\".\nThe Moderates can generally be divided into \"puritanos\" and \"doctrinarios\". The former, headed by &lt;a href=\"Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Francisco%20Pacheco\"&gt;Joaqu\u00edn Francisco Pacheco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nicomedes%20Pastor%20D%C3%ADaz\"&gt;Nicomedes Pastor D\u00edaz&lt;/a&gt;, favored strict &lt;a href=\"constitutionalism\"&gt;constitutionalism&lt;/a&gt; according to the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201837\"&gt;Constitution of 1837&lt;/a&gt;, even if it meant that the party was less likely to hold power continuously. The \"doctrinarios\" were more willing to use \"illegality and subterfuge\" to hold power for the party. The \"doctrinarios\" were further divided into fluid groups based on clientelism: \"narva\u00edstas\" (around General Narv\u00e1ez), \"monistas\" (around &lt;a href=\"Alejandro%20Mon\"&gt;Alejandro Mon&lt;/a&gt;), \"pidalistas\" (followers of &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Jos%C3%A9%20Pidal%2C%201st%20Marquis%20of%20Pidal\"&gt;Pedro Pidal&lt;/a&gt;), and \"polacos\" (around &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Sartorius\"&gt;Luis Sartorius&lt;/a&gt;, and so named because of Sartorius's &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; ancestry.)\nAlso leagued with the Moderates were the \"vilumistas\", led by the Marquess of Viluma, who wished to go back to the enlightened absolutism of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Royal%20Statute%20of%201834\"&gt;Royal Statute of 1834&lt;/a&gt;. The \"vilumistas\", unlike most other Moderates, were open to a coalition with the Carlists.\nAmong the Progressives, the divisions were more ideological. The right wing of the Progressives overlapped the Moderates politically. This included the \"isturizta\" personal faction around &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Javier%20Ist%C3%BAriz\"&gt;Francisco Javier Ist\u00fariz&lt;/a&gt;, which at times allied with the Moderates against the rest of the Progressives. While some authors use \"exaltados\" almost interchangeably with \"progresistas\", others view this as an anachronism. Left \"progresistas\" were also known as \"puros\".\nThe Democrats also covered a wide range of views. Party leader &lt;a href=\"Nicol%C3%A1s%20Rivero\"&gt;Nicol\u00e1s Rivero&lt;/a&gt; was a constitutional monarchist. &lt;a href=\"Emilio%20Castellar\"&gt;Emilio Castellar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Pi%20y%20Margall\"&gt;Francisco Pi y Margall&lt;/a&gt; were both &lt;a href=\"republicanism\"&gt;republicans&lt;/a&gt;, but the former was more interested in winning the Progressives over to Republicanism and the latter with building a mass movement among the \"populacho\". &lt;a href=\"Sisto%20S%C3%A1enz%20de%20la%20C%C3%A1mara\"&gt;Sisto S\u00e1enz de la C\u00e1mara&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"socialist\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; along lines similar to &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Blanc\"&gt;Louis Blanc&lt;/a&gt; in France; in 1855\u20131856, S\u00e1enz advocated revolutionary terror, undermining the loose Progressive-Democrat alliance of the \"&lt;a href=\"bienio%20progresista\"&gt;bienio progresista&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFinally, Leopoldo O'Donnell's Liberal Union, founded 1858, attempted to bridge nearly all of these groups. Its members included \"doctrinarios\", \"puritanos\", Progressives and even some Democrats. Unsurprisingly, such a broad coalition eventually fragmented back into many separate pieces."
