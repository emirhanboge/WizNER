    "text": "The 7th Reconnaissance Squadron is a &lt;a href=\"squadron%20%28aviation%29\"&gt;squadron&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Air%20Force\"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. It is assigned to the &lt;a href=\"69th%20Reconnaissance%20Group\"&gt;69th Reconnaissance Group&lt;/a&gt; and is stationed at &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Air%20Station%20Sigonella\"&gt;Naval Air Station Sigonella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt;, Italy.\nThe squadron was first established in the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal%20Zone\"&gt;Panama Canal Zone&lt;/a&gt; as the 7th Aero Squadron in 1917 and served as a &lt;a href=\"aerial%20reconnaissance\"&gt;reconnaissance&lt;/a&gt; unit until 1942, when it was redesignated as the 397th Bombardment Squadron. It served as a &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt; unit through &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and was inactivated at &lt;a href=\"Rio%20Hato%20Airport\"&gt;Rio Hato Army Air Base&lt;/a&gt;, Panama on 1 November 1946. The squadron was reactivated in 2015, returning to its earlier reconnaissance mission.\nHistory.\nThe squadron's mission from its inception in 1917 to its inactivation in 1946 was the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal\"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt;. During the 1920s and 1930s it participated in a number of goodwill missions to nations in Central and South America. From its origins in 1917 until 1942, the unit was designated a variation of the 7th Reconnaissance Squadron.\nWorld War I.\nWith the entry of the United States into &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, the War Department believed it was necessary to establish an air presence along the Atlantic terminus of the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal\"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt; as a defensive measure against an enemy seaborne attack.\nIn advancing its plans for the defense of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, the joint Army-Navy board recommended the establishment of eight aeronautic stations which, with a strength of two &lt;a href=\"dirigible\"&gt;dirigible&lt;/a&gt;s and six or eight &lt;a href=\"seaplane\"&gt;seaplane&lt;/a&gt;s each, could immediately conduct patrol work. Significantly, the only site definitely advanced as vital in the overall plan was that at the &lt;a href=\"Coco%20Solo\"&gt;Coco Solo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; submarine base near &lt;a href=\"Col%C3%B3n%2C%20Panama\"&gt;Col\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal%20Zone\"&gt;Canal Zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Army selected Captain &lt;a href=\"Henry%20H.%20Arnold\"&gt;Henry H. Arnold&lt;/a&gt;, then in training at the Army Aviation School at &lt;a href=\"Rockwell%20Field\"&gt;Rockwell Field&lt;/a&gt;, near San Diego, to proceed immediately to the Canal Zone and form and command an aviation squadron there. This unit was designated the 7th Aero Squadron and was organized on 29 March 1917. Captain Arnold did not remain long with the 7th Aero Squadron, however, as he returned to the United States in April 1917. The squadron personnel arrived for duty in the Canal Zone with 51 officers and enlisted men. Initially garrisoned at &lt;a href=\"Anc%C3%B3n%2C%20Panama\"&gt;Anc\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, Canal Zone at the end of March 1917, the unit moved to Corozal by 16 April. They then moved to the large temporary camp at Empire, Canal Zone in May, all on the Pacific side of the isthmus \u2013 not making the move to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sherman\"&gt;Fort Sherman&lt;/a&gt;'s parade field until around 29 August 1917, on the Atlantic side. The unit did not receive its first aircraft until about 10 December 1917, when two &lt;a href=\"Curtiss%20R-4\"&gt;Curtiss R-4&lt;/a&gt;'s were tested at Fort Sherman. These were followed by &lt;a href=\"Curtiss%20R-6\"&gt;Curtiss R-6&lt;/a&gt;'s on 12 February 1918 which were supplied by the Navy. Besides its Curtiss R-4's and R-6's, the unit also had two &lt;a href=\"Curtiss%20R-3\"&gt;Curtiss R-3&lt;/a&gt;'s which, oddly, had arrived after the R-4's, in late December 1917.\nWith the end of World War I most of the 7th Aero Squadron's personnel were transferred back to the United States for demobilization.\nBetween the wars.\nAfter the war, the squadron evolved into the 7th Squadron (14 March 1921), 7th Observation Squadron (25 January 1925), 7th Reconnaissance Squadron (1 September 1937), 7th Reconnaissance Squadron (Medium Range) (6 December 1939) and 7th Reconnaissance Squadron (Heavy) (20 November 1940) before being finally redesignated as the 397th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 22 April 1942. The squadron was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"6th%20Composite%20Group\"&gt;6th Composite Group&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter World War I, the squadron is credited with having operated numerous aircraft types between 1919 and 1931. These included, the venerable U.S.-built &lt;a href=\"Dayton-Wright%20DH-4\"&gt;Dayton-Wright DH-4&lt;/a&gt; series of light bomber/general purpose aircraft; the &lt;a href=\"Curtiss%20JN-4\"&gt;Curtiss JN-4&lt;/a&gt; \"Jenny\" family of trainers; the &lt;a href=\"Loening%20OA-1\"&gt;Loening OA-1&lt;/a&gt; amphibians, these being uniquely suited to conditions in Panama, &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20O-2\"&gt;Douglas O-2&lt;/a&gt; observation aircraft and, surprisingly, &lt;a href=\"Curtiss%20HS\"&gt;Curtiss HS&lt;/a&gt;-1 and HS-2L flying boats. Of the DH-4's, the first six postwar examples, all virtually stock DH-4B's, arrived for duty with the 7th in February 1920, replacing the well-worn Curtiss R-6's and other earlier DH-4's. By 16 February 1922, the squadron had seven \"war-built\" DH-4's, four DH-4B's, the solitary Curtiss JN-4H, three Curtiss JN-6's. By August, all but one of the \"war-built\" DH-4's had been scrapped and one of the DH-4B's had been converted to DH-4BP-1 (photographic) configuration.\nBy June 1927, the squadron, now in a very lean peacetime stance, had but eight aircraft. These consisted of four DH-4M's, a solitary DH-4B, a &lt;a href=\"Loening%20OA-l\"&gt;Loening OA-l&lt;/a&gt; and two Loening OA-1As.\nIn 1937, the 6th Group, which had been a composite unit since its establishment in 1919, became the 6th Bombardment Group. The squadron was equipped with &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20B-18%20Bolo\"&gt;Douglas B-18 Bolo&lt;/a&gt;s, although a single &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20A-17%20Nomad\"&gt;Northrop A-17 Nomad&lt;/a&gt; was also assigned for a period, together with a &lt;a href=\"Sikorsky%20OA-8\"&gt;Sikorsky OA-8&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 1 February 1940, the assignment to the 6th Bombardment Group was changed to an attachment, as the unit was reassigned to the &lt;a href=\"19th%20Composite%20Wing\"&gt;19th Composite Wing&lt;/a&gt; and placed under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Caribbean Air Force&lt;/a&gt; staff as one of the dedicated reconnaissance elements reporting to that headquarters. On 4 June 1941, it was assigned one &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20B-17B%20Flying%20Fortress\"&gt;Boeing B-17B Flying Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, the first production version of the Flying Fortress, which had been transferred to the command. Obsolete as a bomber, the mission of the B-17B was long-range reconnaissance in the Canal Zone, although the aircraft retained its defensive machine guns for defense against any enemy aircraft it may encounter On 8 October 1941, it was once again assigned to the 6th Bombardment Group and, on 27 November, the unit moved from France Field to the newly constructed &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Field\"&gt;Howard Field&lt;/a&gt; on the Pacific side, where it received four additional B-17Bs.\nWorld War II.\nAfter the Japanese &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Attack on Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; the Squadron was almost immediately deployed to &lt;a href=\"David%20Field%20%28Panama%29\"&gt;David Field&lt;/a&gt;, Panama. The Squadron's B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft deployed elsewhere (mainly to &lt;a href=\"Guatemala%20City%20Airport\"&gt;Guatemala City Airport&lt;/a&gt;) to begin the Pacific patrols in early January 1942. The squadron was redesignated as the 397th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) effective 22 April 1942.\nThe return to David Field came just in time for deployment of the unit as a whole from David to &lt;a href=\"Talara%20Airfield\"&gt;Talara Airfield&lt;/a&gt;, Peru, where it arrived on 18 August. From there the squadron undertook the Pacific patrol arc out to &lt;a href=\"Seymour%20Airport\"&gt;Seymour Airport&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands\"&gt;Gal\u00e1pagos Islands&lt;/a&gt; and, sometimes, on to Guatemala City Airport. These flights continued, almost non-stop, through May 1943, when the unit was relieved and returned to &lt;a href=\"R%C3%ADo%20Hato%20Field\"&gt;R\u00edo Hato Field&lt;/a&gt; in Panama. The LB-30s retained their original British serial numbers throughout their service with the squadron. Upon its return to Rio Hato on 4 May 1943, the 397th was transformed, as an entirely new &lt;a href=\"cadre%20%28military%29\"&gt;cadre&lt;/a&gt; of personnel replaced the veterans of the Galapagos and earlier tours there. Three days later, the Squadron moved to Howard Field in the Canal Zone, although this was apparently a mere paper move of its headquarters, as the unit's aircraft and personnel actually remained at Rio Hato.\nOn 1 January 1944, the squadron received orders to deploy four of its LB-30s to France Field to participate in the search for several marauding German &lt;a href=\"U-boats\"&gt;U-boats&lt;/a&gt; which were causing considerable alarm in the Caribbean. While at France Field, the aircraft also flew navigational and bombing exercises.\nAll of this was preparatory to the unit's deployment to the &lt;a href=\"Galapagos%20Islands\"&gt;Galapagos Islands&lt;/a&gt; and, starting 7 April 1944, the ground echelon started movement to &lt;a href=\"Balboa%2C%20Panama\"&gt;Balboa&lt;/a&gt;, Canal Zone, via truck for the transfer. The air element got four more B-24J's on 8 April and, with these, flew with the earlier two B-24J's and two B-24D's to Seymour Field in the Galapagos. Other missions, besides the normal long-distance patrols, saw 397th aircraft operating to &lt;a href=\"Salinas%20Airport\"&gt;Salinas Airport&lt;/a&gt;, Ecuador; &lt;a href=\"Havana%20Airport\"&gt;Havana Airport&lt;/a&gt;, Cuba; &lt;a href=\"Borinquen%20Field\"&gt;Borinquen Field&lt;/a&gt;, Puerto Rico; &lt;a href=\"Managua%20Airport\"&gt;Managua Airport&lt;/a&gt;, Nicaragua; &lt;a href=\"Cartagena%20airport\"&gt;Cartagena airport&lt;/a&gt;, Colombia and elsewhere throughout Central and South America.\nIn February 1945, the unit was relieved from duty in the Galapagos and returned to Rio Hato, where the unit ended the war, on 1 November 1946 when it was inactivated.\nReactivation in 2015.\nOn 1 May 2015, the unit was redesignated 7th Reconnaissance Squadron. It was reactivated at &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Air%20Station%20Sigonella\"&gt;Naval Air Station Sigonella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt;, Italy on 15 May, where it replaced Detachment 1, &lt;a href=\"69th%20Reconnaissance%20Group\"&gt;69th Reconnaissance Group&lt;/a&gt;. It is assigned to the 69th Group at &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Forks%20Air%20Force%20Base\"&gt;Grand Forks Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt;, North Dakota."
