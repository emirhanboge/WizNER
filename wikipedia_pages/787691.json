The cellone, a large &lt;a href=\"cello\"&gt;cello&lt;/a&gt;, is tuned between the cello and &lt;a href=\"string%20bass\"&gt;string bass&lt;/a&gt;. His instruments received praise and endorsements from major figures of the day, including &lt;a href=\"impresario\"&gt;impresario&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Schulz-Curtius\"&gt;Alfred Schulz-Curtius&lt;/a&gt;, and the German composer &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Draeseke\"&gt;Felix Draeseke&lt;/a&gt; composed his string quintet in A major, named the \"\", specifically for Stelzner instruments.\nStelzner began production of his new instruments in 1889 and continued to make them until 1900.

In addition, he helped sponsor competitions in various categories such as &lt;a href=\"Symphony\"&gt;symphonies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chamber%20music\"&gt;chamber music&lt;/a&gt;. His own works included the operas ' (1902) and ' (1903), as well as the never performed ' and '.\nStelzner's company eventually failed and entered bankruptcy.
