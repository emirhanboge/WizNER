It is made up of mostly Russian clubs, with some others from surrounding countries. Since &lt;a href=\"VTB%20United%20League%202013%E2%80%9314\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, it is the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20basketball%20league%20system\"&gt;first tier&lt;/a&gt; of Russian professional club basketball. Therefore, the highest placed Russian team in the league is also named &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20Russian%20basketball%20champions\"&gt;Russian national champions&lt;/a&gt;. Its goal is to unite the leading basketball clubs of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Europe\"&gt;Northern Europe&lt;/a&gt; together into one league. The league is sponsored by &lt;a href=\"VTB%20Bank\"&gt;VTB Bank&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe current champions are &lt;a href=\"PBC%20CSKA%20Moscow\"&gt;CSKA Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, who secured their 11th title after defeating &lt;a href=\"BC%20UNICS\"&gt;UNICS&lt;/a&gt; 3:0 in the &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20VTB%20United%20League%23Playoffs\"&gt;2021 Finals&lt;/a&gt;. The VTB United League also holds a youth competition, the &lt;a href=\"VTB%20United%20Youth%20League\"&gt;VTB United Youth League&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormats.\nIn its inaugural 2009\u201310 season, the VTB United League featured clubs from &lt;a href=\"Estonia\"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Latvia\"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. For the 2010\u201311 season, teams from &lt;a href=\"Belarus\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; were added to the league. The 2011\u201312 season featured a total of 18 teams, with new teams being added from the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;. In the 2012\u201313 season, the number of teams increased to 20. The number of teams was decreased to 16 for the 2014\u201315 season, and the teams from &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; dropped out of the league.\nHistory.\nThe first step in the creation of the league was a competition named the &lt;a href=\"VTB%20United%20League%20Promo-Cup\"&gt;VTB United League Promo-Cup&lt;/a&gt; held in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; in December, 2008. The final of the Promo-Cup was played on December 22, 2008, and was won by &lt;a href=\"PBC%20CSKA%20Moscow\"&gt;CSKA Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated &lt;a href=\"BC%20Khimki\"&gt;Khimki&lt;/a&gt; 70\u201366. &lt;a href=\"BC%20Kyiv\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; ended third.\nUnification with the Russian PBL.\nIn May 2012, all the PBL clubs gathered to decide which format would be used for the next season, and some club's directors raised the possibility of uniting with the VTB United League, to produce greater competition between the Russian basketball clubs. They suggested that the new league would be named the Eastern European Professional Basketball League.\nIn July 2012, the Council of VTB United League gave a definitive decision. It was decided that the PBL league would continue for one more year, with some of the games of the VTB United League that took place between two Russian clubs being counted as PBL games. The &lt;a href=\"Russian%20basketball%20league%20system\"&gt;first tier&lt;/a&gt; Russian clubs then replaced the PBL with the VTB United League as their new national domestic league, starting with the 2013-14 season.\nThe VTB United League was officially recognized by &lt;a href=\"FIBA%20Europe\"&gt;FIBA Europe&lt;/a&gt; in September 2013. The league was then officially recognized by &lt;a href=\"FIBA\"&gt;FIBA World&lt;/a&gt; in October 2014. The league needed to be recognized by both bodies, because it contains clubs that come from countries that are part of both the European and Asian FIBA zones.\nThe honorary head of the league is &lt;a href=\"Sergei%20Ivanov\"&gt;Sergei Ivanov&lt;/a&gt; and its official sponsor is &lt;a href=\"Pavel%20Vrublevsky\"&gt;Pavel Vrublevsky&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ChronoPay\"&gt;ChronoPay&lt;/a&gt; who are often seen together.\nArena rules.\nIn order for clubs to play in the VTB United League, they must have a home arena that has a seating capacity of at least 3,000 seats.\nSponsor.\nAlthough during 2014 &lt;a href=\"Andrey%20Kostin\"&gt;Andrey Kostin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"VTB%20Bank\"&gt;VTB Bank&lt;/a&gt; contributed 150 million rubles to VTB Union League which was third to its 4.5 billion rubles contributed to &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dynamo%20Moscow\"&gt;FC Dynamo Moscow&lt;/a&gt; and 750 million rubles contributed to support &lt;a href=\"HC%20Dynamo%20Moscow\"&gt;HC Dynamo Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, his VTB bank recorded very large losses of 5 billion rubles in March 2015 connected to its sponsorships and contributions to charities of over a total of 15.5 billion rubles that had 10 billion rubles given to undisclosed recipients. This led to the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Bank of Moscow&lt;/a&gt; giving VTB Bank an 8 billion rubles loan at 0.51% per year with maturity in 2021. Of VTB Bank money given away during 2014, 80% of the total of 17.5 billion rubles were given away in the fourth quarter."
