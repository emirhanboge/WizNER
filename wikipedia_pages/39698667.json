    "text": "The Mark 19 torpedo was an electric &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; designed in 1942 by &lt;a href=\"Westinghouse%20Electric\"&gt;Westinghouse Electric&lt;/a&gt; as a follow-on development of the &lt;a href=\"Mark%2018%20torpedo\"&gt;Mark 18 torpedo&lt;/a&gt;. The goal was to build a torpedo that incorporated all-electric controls in place of &lt;a href=\"pneumatics\"&gt;pneumatic control&lt;/a&gt;s. Its &lt;a href=\"gyroscope\"&gt;gyroscope&lt;/a&gt; and depth control were electrically controlled and operated, while the rudders were &lt;a href=\"solenoid\"&gt;solenoid&lt;/a&gt; operated.\nFurther development of the Mark 19 was cancelled in favor of the &lt;a href=\"Mark%2026%20torpedo\"&gt;Mark 26 torpedo&lt;/a&gt;."
