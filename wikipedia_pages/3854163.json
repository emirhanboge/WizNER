    "text": "Cryogenic particle detectors operate at very low temperature, typically only a few degrees above &lt;a href=\"absolute%20zero\"&gt;absolute zero&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href=\"sensors\"&gt;sensors&lt;/a&gt; interact with an energetic &lt;a href=\"elementary%20particle\"&gt;elementary particle&lt;/a&gt; (such as a &lt;a href=\"photon\"&gt;photon&lt;/a&gt;) and deliver a signal that can be related to the type of particle and the nature of the interaction. While many types of particle detectors might be operated with improved performance at &lt;a href=\"Cryogenics\"&gt;cryogenic&lt;/a&gt; temperatures, this term generally refers to types that take advantage of special effects or properties occurring only at low temperature.\nIntroduction.\nThe most commonly cited reason for operating any sensor at low temperature is the reduction in &lt;a href=\"thermal%20noise\"&gt;thermal noise&lt;/a&gt;, which is proportional to the square root of the &lt;a href=\"absolute%20temperature\"&gt;absolute temperature&lt;/a&gt;. However, at very low temperature, certain material properties become very sensitive to energy deposited by particles in their passage through the sensor, and the gain from these changes may be even more than that from reduction in thermal noise. Two such commonly used properties are &lt;a href=\"heat%20capacity\"&gt;heat capacity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"electrical%20resistivity\"&gt;electrical resistivity&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href=\"superconductivity\"&gt;superconductivity&lt;/a&gt;; other designs are based on superconducting &lt;a href=\"tunnel%20junction\"&gt;tunnel junction&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"quasiparticle\"&gt;quasiparticle&lt;/a&gt; trapping, &lt;a href=\"roton\"&gt;roton&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"superfluid\"&gt;superfluid&lt;/a&gt;s, magnetic &lt;a href=\"bolometer\"&gt;bolometer&lt;/a&gt;s, and other principles.\nOriginally, astronomy pushed the development of cryogenic detectors for optical and infrared radiation. Later, particle physics and cosmology motivated cryogenic detector development for sensing known and predicted particles such as &lt;a href=\"neutrino\"&gt;neutrino&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"axion\"&gt;axion&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"weakly%20interacting%20massive%20particles\"&gt;weakly interacting massive particles&lt;/a&gt; (WIMPs).\nTypes of cryogenic particle detectors.\nCalorimetric particle detection.\nA &lt;a href=\"calorimeter\"&gt;calorimeter&lt;/a&gt; is a device that measures the amount of &lt;a href=\"heat\"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; deposited in a sample of material. A calorimeter differs from a &lt;a href=\"bolometer\"&gt;bolometer&lt;/a&gt; in that a calorimeter measures energy, while a bolometer measures &lt;a href=\"power%20%28physics%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelow the &lt;a href=\"Debye%20temperature\"&gt;Debye temperature&lt;/a&gt; of a crystalline &lt;a href=\"dielectric\"&gt;dielectric&lt;/a&gt; material (such as &lt;a href=\"silicon\"&gt;silicon&lt;/a&gt;), the heat capacity decreases inversely as the cube of the absolute temperature. It becomes very small, so that the sample's increase in temperature for a given heat input may be relatively large. This makes it practical to make a calorimeter that has a very large temperature excursion for a small amount of heat input, such as that deposited by a passing particle. The temperature rise can be measured with a standard type of &lt;a href=\"thermistor\"&gt;thermistor&lt;/a&gt;, as in a classical calorimeter. In general, small sample size and very sensitive thermistors are required to make a sensitive particle detector by this method.\nIn principle, several types of &lt;a href=\"thermistors\"&gt;resistance thermometers&lt;/a&gt; can be used. The limit of sensitivity to energy deposition is determined by the magnitude of resistance fluctuations, which are in turn determined by &lt;a href=\"thermal%20fluctuations\"&gt;thermal fluctuations&lt;/a&gt;. Since all &lt;a href=\"resistor\"&gt;resistor&lt;/a&gt;s exhibit voltage fluctuations that are proportional to their temperature, an effect known as &lt;a href=\"Johnson%20noise\"&gt;Johnson noise&lt;/a&gt;, a reduction of temperature is often the only way to achieve the required sensitivity.\nSuperconducting transition-edge sensors.\nA very sensitive calorimetric sensor known as a &lt;a href=\"transition-edge%20sensor\"&gt;transition-edge sensor&lt;/a&gt; (TES) takes advantage of &lt;a href=\"superconductivity\"&gt;superconductivity&lt;/a&gt;. Most pure superconductors have a very sharp transition from normal resistivity to superconductivity at some low temperature. By operating on the superconducting phase transition, a very small change in temperature resulting from interaction with a particle results in a significant change in resistance.\nSuperconducting tunnel junctions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"superconducting%20tunnel%20junction\"&gt;superconducting tunnel junction&lt;/a&gt; (STJ) consists of two pieces of &lt;a href=\"superconducting\"&gt;superconducting&lt;/a&gt; material separated by a very thin (~&lt;a href=\"nanometer\"&gt;nanometer&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Insulator%20%28electrical%29\"&gt;insulating&lt;/a&gt; layer. It is also known as a &lt;a href=\"superconductor-insulator-superconductor%20tunnel%20junction\"&gt;superconductor-insulator-superconductor tunnel junction&lt;/a&gt; (SIS) and is a type of a &lt;a href=\"Josephson%20junction\"&gt;Josephson junction&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cooper%20pairs\"&gt;Cooper pairs&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"Quantum%20tunneling\"&gt;tunnel&lt;/a&gt; across the insulating barrier, a phenomenon known as the &lt;a href=\"Josephson%20effect\"&gt;Josephson effect&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Quasiparticles\"&gt;Quasiparticles&lt;/a&gt; can also tunnel across the barrier, although the quasiparticle current is suppressed for voltages less than twice the superconducting energy gap. A photon absorbed on one side of a STJ breaks Cooper pairs and creates quasiparticles. In the presence of an applied voltage across the junction, the quasiparticles tunnel across the junction, and the resulting tunneling current is proportional to the photon energy. The STJ can also be used as a &lt;a href=\"heterodyne%20detector\"&gt;heterodyne detector&lt;/a&gt; by exploiting the change in the nonlinear &lt;a href=\"current%E2%80%93voltage%20characteristic\"&gt;current\u2013voltage characteristic&lt;/a&gt; that results from photon-assisted tunneling. STJs are the most sensitive heterodyne detectors available for the 100\u00a0GHz \u2013 1\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Terahertz%20%28unit%29\"&gt;THz&lt;/a&gt; frequency range and are employed for &lt;a href=\"astronomical\"&gt;astronomical&lt;/a&gt; observation at these frequencies.\nKinetic inductance detectors.\nThe &lt;a href=\"kinetic%20inductance%20detector\"&gt;kinetic inductance detector&lt;/a&gt; (KID) is based on measuring the change in &lt;a href=\"kinetic%20inductance\"&gt;kinetic inductance&lt;/a&gt; caused by the absorption of photons in a thin strip of &lt;a href=\"superconductivity\"&gt;superconducting&lt;/a&gt; material. The change in inductance is typically measured as the change in the resonant frequency of a &lt;a href=\"microwave\"&gt;microwave&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"resonator\"&gt;resonator&lt;/a&gt;, and hence these detectors are also known as microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs).\nSuperconducting granules.\nThe superconducting transition alone can be used to directly measure the heating caused by a passing particle. A type-I superconducting grain in a magnetic field exhibits perfect &lt;a href=\"diamagnetism\"&gt;diamagnetism&lt;/a&gt; and excludes the field completely from its interior. If it is held slightly below the transition temperature, the superconductivity vanishes on heating by particle radiation, and the field suddenly penetrates the interior. This field change can be detected by a surrounding coil. The change is reversible when the grain cools again. In practice the grains must be very small and carefully made, and carefully coupled to the coil.\nMagnetic calorimeters.\n&lt;a href=\"Paramagnetism\"&gt;Paramagnetic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rare-earth\"&gt;rare-earth&lt;/a&gt; ions are being used as particle sensors by sensing the spin flips of the paramagnetic atoms induced by heat absorbed in a low-heat-capacity material. The ions are used as a magnetic thermometer.\nOther methods.\nPhonon particle detection.\nCalorimeters assume the sample is in &lt;a href=\"thermal%20equilibrium\"&gt;thermal equilibrium&lt;/a&gt; or nearly so. In crystalline materials at very low temperature this is not necessarily the case. A good deal more information can be found by measuring the elementary excitations of the crystal lattice, or &lt;a href=\"phonon\"&gt;phonon&lt;/a&gt;s, caused by the interacting particle. This can be done by several methods including superconducting &lt;a href=\"transition%20edge%20sensors\"&gt;transition edge sensors&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuperconducting nanowire single-photon detectors.\nThe &lt;a href=\"superconducting%20nanowire%20single-photon%20detector\"&gt;superconducting nanowire single-photon detector&lt;/a&gt; (SNSPD) is based on a superconducting wire cooled well below the superconducting transition temperature and biased with a dc &lt;a href=\"electric%20current\"&gt;current&lt;/a&gt; that is close to but less than the superconducting critical current. The SNSPD is typically made from \u2248 5\u00a0nm thick &lt;a href=\"niobium%20nitride\"&gt;niobium nitride&lt;/a&gt; films which are patterned as narrow nanowires (with a typical width of 100\u00a0nm). Absorption of a photon breaks &lt;a href=\"Cooper%20pairs\"&gt;Cooper pairs&lt;/a&gt; and reduces the critical current below the bias current. A small non-superconducting section across the width of the nanowire is formed. This resistive non-superconducting section then leads to a detectable voltage pulse of a duration of about 1 nanosecond. The main advantages of this type of photon detector are its high speed (a maximal count rate of 2\u00a0GHz makes them the fastest available) and its low dark count rate. The main disadvantage is the lack of intrinsic energy resolution.\nRoton detectors.\nIn superfluid &lt;a href=\"Helium-4\"&gt;4He&lt;/a&gt; the elementary collective excitations are &lt;a href=\"phonon\"&gt;phonon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"roton\"&gt;roton&lt;/a&gt;s. A particle striking an electron or nucleus in this superfluid can produce rotons, which may be detected bolometrically or by the evaporation of helium atoms when they reach a free surface. 4He is intrinsically very pure so the rotons travel ballistically and are stable, so that large volumes of fluid can be used.\nQuasiparticles in superfluid 3He.\nIn the B phase, below 0.001 K, superfluid &lt;a href=\"Helium-3\"&gt;3He&lt;/a&gt; acts similarly to a superconductor. Pairs of atoms are bound as &lt;a href=\"quasiparticle\"&gt;quasiparticle&lt;/a&gt;s similar to Cooper pairs with a very small energy gap of the order of 100 nano&lt;a href=\"electronvolt\"&gt;electronvolt&lt;/a&gt;s. This allows building a detector\nanalogous to a superconducting tunnel detector. The advantage is that many (~109) pairs\ncould be produced by a single interaction, but the difficulties are that it is difficult \nto measure the excess of normal 3He atoms produced and to prepare and maintain much\nsuperfluid at such low temperature."
