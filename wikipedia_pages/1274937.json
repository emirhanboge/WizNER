    "text": "Trolley Square is a partially enclosed &lt;a href=\"shopping%20center\"&gt;shopping center&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20City\"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Utah\"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. It is considered to be a trendy high-end center. The center is near downtown Salt Lake City and the &lt;a href=\"TRAX%20%28light%20rail%29\"&gt;UTA TRAX&lt;/a&gt; light-rail system.\nHistory.\nDescription.\nTrolley Square is composed of barns that were built in 1908 to house Salt Lake City's &lt;a href=\"streetcar\"&gt;streetcar&lt;/a&gt;s. The streetcar system was dismantled in 1945, and the barns were converted into a two-story shopping center in 1972. The center is noted for its unusual architecture consisting of winding hallways, brick and wooden floors, fountains, old-trees, and &lt;a href=\"wrought-iron\"&gt;wrought-iron&lt;/a&gt; balconies. Prominent tenants include &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.samwellers.com/\"&gt;Weller Book Works&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pottery%20Barn\"&gt;Pottery Barn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cabin%20Fever%20%28card%20store%29\"&gt;Cabin Fever&lt;/a&gt; (a popular card store), &lt;a href=\"Williams%20Sonoma%20%28brand%29\"&gt;Williams Sonoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Spaghetti%20Factory\"&gt;Old Spaghetti Factory&lt;/a&gt;, The Desert Edge Brewery at the Pub, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thespectacle.com/\"&gt;The Spectacle&lt;/a&gt;, and local boutiques.\nThe Trolley Square &lt;a href=\"water%20tower\"&gt;water tower&lt;/a&gt; is covered in red and blue &lt;a href=\"neon%20sign\"&gt;neon lights&lt;/a&gt;, and it is a prominent feature of the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Lake%20City\"&gt;Salt Lake City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skyline\"&gt;skyline&lt;/a&gt;, able to be spotted from miles away at night. For many years, the tower was a &lt;a href=\"weather%20beacon\"&gt;weather beacon&lt;/a&gt;, giving the local &lt;a href=\"weather%20forecast\"&gt;weather forecast&lt;/a&gt; based on the colors of lights, with solid blue being &lt;a href=\"fair%20weather\"&gt;fair weather&lt;/a&gt;, flashing blue being &lt;a href=\"cloudy%20weather\"&gt;cloudy weather&lt;/a&gt;, solid red being &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;, and flashing red being &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;. The Trolley Square water tower was renovated in fall 2014.\nAnother prominent feature of Trolley Square is the &lt;a href=\"sky%20bridge\"&gt;sky bridge&lt;/a&gt; that connects the main building to a small parking lot located across the street. The bridge was made from a salvaged ore conveyor bridge formerly in use at the &lt;a href=\"International%20Smelting%20and%20Refining%20Company\"&gt;International Smelting and Refining Company&lt;/a&gt; facility in &lt;a href=\"Tooele%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Tooele, Utah&lt;/a&gt;. The bridge goes over 600 South, and it features neon lights shaped in the form of a trolley.\n2007 shooting.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Trolley%20Square%20shooting\"&gt;Trolley Square shooting&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"mass%20shooting\"&gt;mass shooting&lt;/a&gt; that occurred on the evening of February 12, 2007 at the mall. A lone gunman, identified as Sulejman Talovi\u0107, killed five bystanders and wounded four others before being shot dead by several members of the Salt Lake City Police Department. Authorities were not able to determine a motive.\nMajor businesses.\nSale and development.\nTrolley Square is owned by SK Hart Management, who purchased it in May 2013."
