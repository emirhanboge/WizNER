    "text": "Raynaud syndrome, also known as Raynaud's phenomenon, eponymously named after the physician &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Raynaud\"&gt;Auguste Gabriel Maurice Raynaud&lt;/a&gt;, who first described it in his doctoral thesis in 1862, is a &lt;a href=\"medical%20condition\"&gt;medical condition&lt;/a&gt; in which the &lt;a href=\"vasospasm\"&gt;spasm of small arteries&lt;/a&gt; causes episodes of reduced &lt;a href=\"blood%20flow\"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to end arterioles. Typically, the fingers, and less commonly, the toes, are involved. Rarely, the nose, ears, or lips are affected. The episodes classically result in the affected part turning &lt;a href=\"pallor\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"cyanosis\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;. Often, &lt;a href=\"numbness\"&gt;numbness&lt;/a&gt; or pain occurs. As blood flow returns, the area turns red and burns. The episodes typically last minutes but can last several hours.\nEpisodes are typically triggered by cold or emotional stress. Primary Raynaud's, also known as &lt;a href=\"idiopathic\"&gt;idiopathic&lt;/a&gt;, means that it is spontaneous, of unknown cause, and unrelated to another disease. Secondary Raynaud's occurs as a result of another condition and has an older age at onset; episodes are intensely painful and can be asymmetric and associated with skin lesions. Secondary Raynaud's can occur due to a &lt;a href=\"connective%20tissue%20disease\"&gt;connective-tissue disorder&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"scleroderma\"&gt;scleroderma&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lupus\"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt;, injuries to the hands, &lt;a href=\"Vibration%20white%20finger\"&gt;prolonged vibration&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, &lt;a href=\"thyroid\"&gt;thyroid&lt;/a&gt; problems, and certain medications, such as &lt;a href=\"birth%20control%20pills\"&gt;birth control pills&lt;/a&gt;. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms.\nThe primary treatment is avoiding the cold. Other measures include the discontinuation of nicotine or &lt;a href=\"stimulant\"&gt;stimulant&lt;/a&gt; use. Medications for treatment of cases that do not improve include &lt;a href=\"calcium%20channel%20blockers\"&gt;calcium channel blockers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iloprost\"&gt;iloprost&lt;/a&gt;. Little evidence supports &lt;a href=\"alternative%20medicine\"&gt;alternative medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Severe disease may in rare cases lead to complications, specifically &lt;a href=\"Ulcer%20%28dermatology%29\"&gt;skin sores&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ischemic%20gangrene\"&gt;gangrene&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbout 4% of people have the condition. Onset of the primary form is typically between ages 15 and 30 and occurs more frequently in females. The secondary form usually affects older people. Both forms are more common in cold &lt;a href=\"climate\"&gt;climate&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe condition can cause localized pain, discoloration (paleness), and sensations of cold and/or numbness.\nWhen exposed to cold temperatures, the blood supply to the fingers or toes, and in some cases the nose or earlobes, is markedly reduced; the skin turns pale or white (called &lt;a href=\"pallor\"&gt;pallor&lt;/a&gt;) and becomes cold and numb.\nThese events are episodic, and when the episode subsides or the area is warmed, the blood flow returns, and the skin color first turns red (&lt;a href=\"rubor\"&gt;rubor&lt;/a&gt;), and then back to normal, often accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Swelling%20%28medical%29\"&gt;swelling&lt;/a&gt;, tingling, and a painful \"pins and needles\" sensation. All three color changes are observed in classic Raynaud's. However, not all patients see all of the aforementioned color changes in all episodes, especially in milder cases of the condition. The red flush is due to reactive &lt;a href=\"hyperemia\"&gt;hyperemia&lt;/a&gt; of the areas deprived of blood flow.\nIn &lt;a href=\"pregnancy\"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, this sign normally disappears due to increased surface blood flow. Raynaud's has occurred in breastfeeding mothers, causing nipples to turn white and painful.\nCauses.\nPrimary.\nRaynaud's disease, or primary Raynaud's, is diagnosed if the symptoms are &lt;a href=\"idiopathic\"&gt;idiopathic&lt;/a&gt;, that is, if they occur by themselves and not in association with other diseases. Some refer to primary Raynaud's disease as \"being allergic to coldness\". It often develops in young women in their teens and early adulthood. Primary Raynaud's is thought to be at least partly &lt;a href=\"Heredity\"&gt;hereditary&lt;/a&gt;, although specific genes have not yet been identified.\n&lt;a href=\"Tobacco%20smoking\"&gt;Smoking&lt;/a&gt; increases frequency and intensity of attacks, and a hormonal component exists. &lt;a href=\"Caffeine\"&gt;Caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, estrogen, and nonselective beta-blockers are often listed as aggravating factors, but evidence that they should be avoided is not solid.\nSecondary.\nRaynaud's phenomenon, or secondary Raynaud's, occurs secondary to a wide variety of other conditions.\nSecondary Raynaud's has a number of associations:\nRaynaud's can precede these other diseases by many years, making it the first presenting symptom. This may be the case in the &lt;a href=\"CREST%20syndrome\"&gt;CREST syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, of which Raynaud's is a part.\nPatients with secondary Raynaud's can also have symptoms related to their underlying diseases. Raynaud's phenomenon is the initial symptom that presents for 70% of patients with &lt;a href=\"scleroderma\"&gt;scleroderma&lt;/a&gt;, a skin and joint disease.\nWhen Raynaud's phenomenon is limited to one hand or one foot, it is referred to as unilateral Raynaud's. This is an uncommon form, and it is always secondary to local or regional vascular disease. It commonly progresses within several years to affect other limbs as the vascular disease progresses.\nMechanism.\nIts pathophysiology includes hyperactivation of the &lt;a href=\"sympathetic%20nervous%20system\"&gt;sympathetic nervous system&lt;/a&gt; causing extreme &lt;a href=\"vasoconstriction\"&gt;vasoconstriction&lt;/a&gt; of the peripheral blood vessels, leading to tissue &lt;a href=\"Hypoxia%20%28medical%29\"&gt;hypoxia&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiagnosis.\nDistinguishing Raynaud's disease (primary Raynaud's) from Raynaud's phenomenon (secondary Raynaud's) is important. Looking for signs of &lt;a href=\"arthritis\"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"vasculitis\"&gt;vasculitis&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a number of laboratory tests, may separate them. Nail fold capillary examination or \"capillaroscopy\" is one of the most sensitive methods to diagnose RS with connective tissue disorders, ie distinguish a secondary from a primary form objectively.\nIf suspected to be secondary to &lt;a href=\"systemic%20sclerosis\"&gt;systemic sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, one tool which may help aid in the prediction of systemic sclerosis is thermography.\nA careful medical history will seek to identify or exclude possible secondary causes.\nTo aid in the diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon, multiple sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed. Table 1 below provides a summary of these various diagnostic criteria.\nRecently, International Consensus Criteria were developed for the diagnosis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon by a panel of experts in the fields of rheumatology and dermatology.\nManagement.\nSecondary Raynaud's is managed primarily by treating the underlying cause, and as primary Raynaud's, avoiding triggers, such as cold, emotional and environmental stress, vibrations and repetitive motions, and avoiding smoking (including passive smoking) and &lt;a href=\"sympathomimetic%20drug\"&gt;sympathomimetic drug&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMedications.\nMedications can be helpful for moderate or severe disease.\nAlternative medicine.\nEvidence does not support the use of alternative medicine, including &lt;a href=\"acupuncture\"&gt;acupuncture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"laser%20therapy\"&gt;laser therapy&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrognosis.\nThe prognosis of primary Raynaud syndrome is often very favorable, with no mortality and little morbidity. However, a minority develops &lt;a href=\"gangrene\"&gt;gangrene&lt;/a&gt;. The prognosis of secondary Raynaud is dependent on the underlying disease, and how effective blood flow-restoring maneuvers are."
