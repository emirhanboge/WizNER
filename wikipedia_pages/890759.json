    "text": "John Wesley \"Jack\" Glasscock (July 22, 1857 \u2013 February 24, 1947) was an American &lt;a href=\"shortstop\"&gt;shortstop&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; who played for several teams from 1879 to 1895 and was the top player at his position in the 1880s during the sport's bare-handed era. He led the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"fielding%20percentage\"&gt;fielding percentage&lt;/a&gt; seven times and in &lt;a href=\"assist%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;assists&lt;/a&gt; six times, with both marks remaining league records until &lt;a href=\"Ozzie%20Smith\"&gt;Ozzie Smith&lt;/a&gt; surpassed them in the 1980s; he also led the NL in &lt;a href=\"double%20play\"&gt;double play&lt;/a&gt;s four times and in &lt;a href=\"putout\"&gt;putout&lt;/a&gt;s twice. He won the &lt;a href=\"1890%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1890&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting&lt;/a&gt; title with a .336 average for the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; and led the league in &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; twice; in his final season he became the sixth major league player to make 2,000 hits. He was the first player to appear in over 600 games as a shortstop, and ended his career with major league records for games (1,628), putouts (2,821), assists (5,630), &lt;a href=\"total%20chances\"&gt;total chances&lt;/a&gt; (9,283), double plays (620) and fielding percentage (.910) at the position. When he retired he ranked fifth in major league history in &lt;a href=\"games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; (1,736) and &lt;a href=\"at%20bat\"&gt;at bat&lt;/a&gt;s (7,030), seventh in &lt;a href=\"total%20bases\"&gt;total bases&lt;/a&gt; (2,630) and eighth in &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubles&lt;/a&gt; (313).\nBiography.\nJack Glasscock was born in &lt;a href=\"Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Wheeling, West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; (then Virginia) to Thomas Glasscock (born 1830) and the former Julia Collette (born 1833), and dropped out of school in fourth grade to pursue his father's trade of &lt;a href=\"carpenter\"&gt;carpentry&lt;/a&gt;. Nicknamed \"Pebbly Jack\" for his habit of scrutinizing the infield for small stones, typically pocketing them, the practice helped him to avoid the bad-hop ground balls which more regularly afflicted other infielders; fielding averages of the era rarely exceeded .900 among shortstops. He played for the local Standard club in 1876, the Champion City club of &lt;a href=\"Springfield%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Springfield, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; in 1877, and the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Allegheny%20%28International%20Association%29\"&gt;Pittsburgh Allegheny Base Ball Club&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Association%20for%20Professional%20Base%20Ball%20Players\"&gt;International Association&lt;/a&gt; in 1878, the latter at third base. After Allegheny folded, he finished the season with &lt;a href=\"Cleveland%20Blues%20%28NL%29\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; and broke into the &lt;a href=\"National%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; with that club in &lt;a href=\"1879%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1879&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;n in the majors. After playing second and third bases as a rookie, he switched to shortstop permanently in &lt;a href=\"1880%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1880&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Dunlap\"&gt;Fred Dunlap&lt;/a&gt; taking over at second. In &lt;a href=\"1881%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1881&lt;/a&gt; he led the NL in putouts (105), assists (274) and fielding average (.911) for the first time. Over five seasons with the team he gradually improved his hitting, and in &lt;a href=\"1882%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1882&lt;/a&gt; he was among the league's top ten players in &lt;a href=\"home%20run\"&gt;home run&lt;/a&gt;s (4), doubles (27), &lt;a href=\"slugging%20average\"&gt;slugging average&lt;/a&gt; (.450) and total bases (161) while also leading the league in assists (311) and tying &lt;a href=\"Sadie%20Houck\"&gt;Sadie Houck&lt;/a&gt;'s major league record of 40 double plays, set the previous year; &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Fennelly\"&gt;Frank Fennelly&lt;/a&gt; set a new major league mark with 46 for the &lt;a href=\"1885%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1885&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Red%20Stockings%20%28AA%29\"&gt;Cincinnati Red Stockings&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Association%20%2819th%20century%29\"&gt;American Association&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1883%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1883&lt;/a&gt;, batting third, Glasscock led the team in &lt;a href=\"run%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt;, and paced the NL in fielding again with a .922 average. In mid-1884 he jumped to the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Outlaw%20Reds\"&gt;Cincinnati Outlaw Reds&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Association\"&gt;Union Association&lt;/a&gt; during that league's only season of play and batted .419 in 38 games.\nHe returned to the NL with the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Maroons/Indianapolis%20Hoosiers\"&gt;St. Louis Maroons&lt;/a&gt; for the next two years, becoming team &lt;a href=\"captain%20%28sports%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;. In 1885 he set an NL record for assists (397), breaking &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Irwin\"&gt;Arthur Irwin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"1880%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1880&lt;/a&gt; mark of 339, and led the league in fielding average (.917); he also moved ahead of &lt;a href=\"Davy%20Force\"&gt;Davy Force&lt;/a&gt; to become the major league career leader in games at shortstop. In &lt;a href=\"1886%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1886&lt;/a&gt; he hit .325 and was fifth in the league in doubles and sixth in hits, also breaking his own NL record with 43 double plays and again leading the NL in assists (392) and fielding (.906). The Maroons moved to Indianapolis and became the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Maroons/Indianapolis%20Hoosiers\"&gt;Indianapolis Hoosiers&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"1887%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1887&lt;/a&gt;, and Glasscock continued his solid output in Indianapolis with a .294 average that year. He also set new major league records for assists (493) and double plays (58), topping Fennelly's totals of 485 and 54 with the previous year's Red Stockings. &lt;a href=\"Ollie%20Beard\"&gt;Ollie Beard&lt;/a&gt; broke his major league assists mark with 537 for the &lt;a href=\"1889%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1889&lt;/a&gt; Red Stockings, and &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Allen%20%28baseball%20shortstop%29\"&gt;Bob Allen&lt;/a&gt; set a new NL mark with 500 for the 1890 &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Phillies\"&gt;Philadelphia Phillies&lt;/a&gt;. Glasscock led the league in fielding (.901) again in &lt;a href=\"1888%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1888&lt;/a&gt;, and would later break his own NL double play record with 60 in 1889, though Beard set a new major league mark with 63 the same year; Allen broke the NL mark with 68 in 1890.\n1889 marked Glasscock's top all-around season as he batted .352 \u2013 second in the NL behind &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Brouthers\"&gt;Dan Brouthers&lt;/a&gt;, and the best average by a major league shortstop prior to 1893, when the pitching distance was increased to \u2013 and led the league in hits (205). He was second in doubles (40, behind &lt;a href=\"King%20Kelly\"&gt;King Kelly&lt;/a&gt;) and total bases (272, behind &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Ryan%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Jimmy Ryan&lt;/a&gt;), and was fifth in the league with a career-high 128 &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, he led the league in every defensive category (246 putouts, 478 assists, 60 double plays, .915 average). His 246 putouts set a new NL record, breaking &lt;a href=\"John%20Montgomery%20Ward\"&gt;John Montgomery Ward&lt;/a&gt;'s 1887 major league record of 226 (&lt;a href=\"Herman%20Long%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Herman Long&lt;/a&gt; had 335 for the 1889 American Association &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Cowboys%20%28American%20Association%29\"&gt;Kansas City Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;); Bob Allen would also break this record just a year later. Glasscock &lt;a href=\"hitting%20for%20the%20cycle\"&gt;hit for the cycle&lt;/a&gt; on August 8 of that year; he also &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;managed&lt;/a&gt; the team for the last half of the season, posting a 34\u201332 record. Early in the year, he discovered 17-year-old future &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Hall of Famer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Amos%20Rusie\"&gt;Amos Rusie&lt;/a&gt; pitching for a local semi-pro team, and the young hurler was promptly acquired for Indianapolis.\nWhen the Hoosiers folded after the 1889 season, his contract \u2013 as well as Rusie's \u2013 was awarded to the Giants to replace Ward, who was leading many of the sport's top players in a shift to the &lt;a href=\"Players%27%20League\"&gt;Players' League&lt;/a&gt; for the 1890 season. Glasscock had been intending to switch leagues as well but was expelled from the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players after signing his 1890 contract with Indianapolis. He won the 1890 batting championship by eleven points over &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Hamilton%20%28baseball%2C%20born%201866%29\"&gt;Billy Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, going 6-for-6 on September 27; he also became the second player to lead the NL in hits two years in a row (joining Brouthers), and was second in doubles to &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Thompson\"&gt;Sam Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and fifth in total bases. His offensive totals dropped off in later seasons, partially as a result of an 1891 hand injury. When the American Association merged with the NL prior to the 1892 season, Glasscock shifted to the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Browns%20%28NL%29\"&gt;St. Louis Browns&lt;/a&gt; (the team now known as the Cardinals), hitting .241 and .267 in two full seasons; he also managed the team for the first four games of the 1892 season, going 1\u20133. In June 1893 he was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt;, and he hit .341 over the remainder of the year, finishing with a .320 average and also with 100 RBI for the first time. The team finished only five games out of first place, the closest he would come to a league title during his major league career. He batted .280 in his last full season in &lt;a href=\"1894%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1894&lt;/a&gt;, leading the NL in fielding for the last time with a .933 average, and ended his major league career in &lt;a href=\"1895%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1895&lt;/a&gt;, splitting the year between the &lt;a href=\"Louisville%20Colonels\"&gt;Louisville Colonels&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Senators%20%281891%E2%80%9399%29\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlasscock left the major leagues with a .290 career batting average, 2040 hits, 27 home runs, 1163 runs, 825 runs batted in and 98 &lt;a href=\"triple%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;triples&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the most difficult players of the 19th century to &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strike out&lt;/a&gt;, doing so just once in every 33 &lt;a href=\"at%20bat\"&gt;at bat&lt;/a&gt;s. He played a notable role in the advancement of defensive tactics, being one of the first shortstops to use signals indicating which infielder would cover second base on &lt;a href=\"stolen%20base\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; attempts, and also one of the first to back up throws to the second baseman. &lt;a href=\"Germany%20Smith\"&gt;Germany Smith&lt;/a&gt; broke his records for career assists and total chances in &lt;a href=\"1897%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1897&lt;/a&gt;, and his mark for games at shortstop in &lt;a href=\"1898%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1898&lt;/a&gt;. Herman Long broke his record for putouts in 1898, and his mark for double plays in . &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Corcoran%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Tommy Corcoran&lt;/a&gt; bettered his career fielding percentage by the end of the 19th century.\nGlasscock returned to Wheeling and played on a minor league team run by &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Barrow\"&gt;Ed Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, winning the first pennant of his career; he remained in the minor leagues as a &lt;a href=\"first%20baseman\"&gt;first baseman&lt;/a&gt; until 1901, winning an 1896 batting title with a .431 average. After his baseball career ended, he returned to carpentry. He died in Wheeling from a &lt;a href=\"stroke\"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; at age 89 and is buried in Wheeling's &lt;a href=\"Greenwood%20Cemetery%20%28Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia%29\"&gt;Greenwood Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.\nExternal links.\n, or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/G/Pglasj101.htm\"&gt;Retrosheet&lt;/a&gt;"
