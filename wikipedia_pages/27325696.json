    "text": "Stefano Dicuonzo (or spells as Di Cuonzo), born 19 September 1985, is an &lt;a href=\"Italians\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"soccer\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;defender&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nJuventus.\nDicuonzo started his career in the &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus F.C.&lt;/a&gt; youth system in 1996. He eventually worked his way up to the \"Primavera\" youth squad for the 2005\u20132006 season, and soon after, he graduated the youth system. During the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2005\u201306 Serie A&lt;/a&gt; season, in which &lt;a href=\"Juventus%20F.C.\"&gt;Juventus F.C.&lt;/a&gt; won their second consecutive \"Scudetto\" (stripped by the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Italian%20football%20scandal\"&gt;2006 Italian football scandal&lt;/a&gt;), although he never made his debut. This would eventually be his only career appearance for Juventus thus far in his career.\nRavenna.\nFollowing his &lt;a href=\"Juventus\"&gt;Juventus&lt;/a&gt; debut, Dicuonzo was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Lega%20Pro%20Prima%20Divisione\"&gt;Serie C1&lt;/a&gt; side, &lt;a href=\"Ravenna%20Calcio\"&gt;Ravenna Calcio&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"co-ownership%20%28football%29\"&gt;co-ownership deal&lt;/a&gt;. He went on to make 23 league appearances that season, scoring one goal, and also helping his side to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; promotion. He was also loaned back to the third tier for &lt;a href=\"A.C.%20Pro%20Sesto\"&gt;Pro Sesto&lt;/a&gt; on 23 July 2007. The loan to Pro Sesto proved very unsuccessful for the fullback, as his season was heavily hampered by injury, which limited the player to just 7 appearances in the league.\nIn June 2008, his co-ownership was resolved in favor of Juventus, and so he returned to the club on 1 July.\nLega Pro.\nUpon returning to Juventus in 2008, he was sold on a co-ownership deal by &lt;a href=\"Lega%20Pro%20Prima%20Divisione\"&gt;Lega Pro Prima Divisione&lt;/a&gt; (ex-Serie C1) team &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20Pro%20Patria%201919\"&gt;Pro Patria&lt;/a&gt;, in attempt to revive his career after the injury setback. Dicuonzo managed just 9 league appearances again during the 2008\u201309 Lega Pro season, again faltering to injury.\nIn July 2009 he officially transferred to &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Catanzaro\"&gt;F.C. Catanzaro&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Lega%20Pro%20Seconda%20Divisione\"&gt;Lega Pro Seconda Divisione&lt;/a&gt;. Dicuonzo established himself as a first team starter, and had a successful season, scoring 1 goal in 33 league appearances.\nS.S. Juve Stabia.\nOn 31 August 2010 he completed a deadline day transfer to &lt;a href=\"Lega%20Pro%20Prima%20Divisione\"&gt;Lega Pro Prima Divisione&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"S.S.%20Juve%20Stabia\"&gt;S.S. Juve Stabia&lt;/a&gt;. Dicuonzo established himself as a first team regular once more with \"le vespe\" and would go on to make 26 league appearances in his first season with the club, scoring a single goal, and also helping his club to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; promotion for the first time in 60 years. Dicuonzo continued to be an integral part of the club's revival, and managed to appear in 40 out of 42 league matches during the &lt;a href=\"2011-12%20Serie%20B\"&gt;2011-12 Serie B&lt;/a&gt; campaign. The club managed to finish in an impressive 9th place in the league table on 57 points, despite beginning the season with a 4 point penalty.\nGrosseto.\nIn summer 2013 he was signed by &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Grosseto%20F.C.\"&gt;Grosseto&lt;/a&gt;. He was released by the club on 10 January 2014."
