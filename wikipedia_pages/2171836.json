Kyabram is located in the centre of a rich &lt;a href=\"irrigation%20district\"&gt;irrigation district&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Goulburn%20River\"&gt;Goulburn River Valley&lt;/a&gt;, north of &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. It is the second-largest town in the &lt;a href=\"Shire%20of%20Campaspe\"&gt;Shire of Campaspe&lt;/a&gt;, situated between the towns of &lt;a href=\"Echuca\"&gt;Echuca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shepparton\"&gt;Shepparton&lt;/a&gt; and is close to the &lt;a href=\"Murray%20River\"&gt;Murray River&lt;/a&gt;, Goulburn River, Campaspe River and Waranga Basin. As of the 2016 census the town had a population of 7,331 people and provides services to a district population of around 16,000.\nThe name of the town is thought to derive from an Aboriginal word Kiambram meaning \"Thick Forest\".\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Yorta%20Yorta\"&gt;Yorta Yorta&lt;/a&gt; people are the original inhabitants of the Goulburn valley.\nThe township started in the 1870s with the first sale of town blocks held in 1876. Kyabram Post Office opened on 23 September 1878. Sheridan Post Office opened on 1 December 1884. On 8 April 1886, in anticipation of the arrival of the railway at what was then Sheridan, Kyabram was renamed Kyabram East and Sheridan was renamed Kyabram. The Kyabram &lt;a href=\"Mechanics%27%20Institutes\"&gt;Mechanics' Institute&lt;/a&gt; was built in 1891.\n&lt;a href=\"John%20Allan%20%28Australian%20politician%29\"&gt;John Allan&lt;/a&gt;, who lived in Kyabram from 1873, became &lt;a href=\"Premier%20of%20Victoria\"&gt;Premier of Victoria&lt;/a&gt; in 1924 and Australia's first &lt;a href=\"National%20Party%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Country Party&lt;/a&gt; premier. Allan was associated with the &lt;a href=\"Kyabram%20Reform%20Movement\"&gt;Kyabram Reform Movement&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative political organisation formed at the start of the 20th century and led by Benjamin Goddard, a local businessman. The movement's campaign played a significant role in the downfall of the &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Peacock\"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt; state government in June 1902 and its sound defeat in the subsequent &lt;a href=\"1902%20Victorian%20state%20election\"&gt;October election&lt;/a&gt;. The incoming &lt;a href=\"William%20Irvine%20%28Australian%20politician%29\"&gt;Irvine&lt;/a&gt; government substantially reduced the number of state parliamentarians, a key demand of the movement.\nKyabram was formally proclaimed a town on 4 July 1973.\nThe Kyabram Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990.\nEconomy.\nThe district is dependent on the primary industries of &lt;a href=\"dairy\"&gt;dairy&lt;/a&gt;ing and fruit &lt;a href=\"orchard\"&gt;orchard&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Jones%20IXL\"&gt;Henry Jones IXL&lt;/a&gt;, a subsidiary of &lt;a href=\"SPC%20Ardmona\"&gt;SPC Ardmona&lt;/a&gt;, operate a plant in the town, manufacturing IXL &lt;a href=\"Fruit%20preserves\"&gt;jams&lt;/a&gt;.
