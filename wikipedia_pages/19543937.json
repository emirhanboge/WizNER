    "text": "Sir Saint is the second official mascot of the &lt;a href=\"NFL\"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%20Saints\"&gt;New Orleans Saints&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Gumbo%20%28mascot%29\"&gt;Gumbo the dog&lt;/a&gt;. Sir Saint is one of the original mascots of the Saints under former owner John Mecom, and was revived by the organization after several decades of hiatus.\nAppearance.\nSir Saint appears as a tall Caucasian with an abnormally large chin, small eyes, and disproportionate feet dressed in a Saints uniform and helmet. He is commonly depicted smirking. He wears gold leggings.\nIn logo format, he stands facing a classic Saints shield to his right (on the viewer's left). The shield has three points at its top and one on the bottom, reading \"SAINTS\" with a black fleur-de-lis under the team name.\nHistory.\nThe Sir Saint logo was first used from 1967 to 1984 along with the shield logo. In 2009, the same season as the Saints' Super Bowl championship, Sir Saint's image was revived and received widespread use, which is still prevalent today in merchandise and company promotion. "
