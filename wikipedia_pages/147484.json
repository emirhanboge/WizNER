    "text": "Plant pathology (also phytopathology) is the scientific study of &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s caused by &lt;a href=\"pathogen\"&gt;pathogen&lt;/a&gt;s (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions (physiological factors). Organisms that cause infectious disease include &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oomycetes\"&gt;oomycetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bacterium\"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plant%20virus\"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"viroid\"&gt;viroid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"virus\"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;-like organisms, &lt;a href=\"phytoplasmas\"&gt;phytoplasmas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"protozoa\"&gt;protozoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nematode\"&gt;nematode&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"parasitic%20plant\"&gt;parasitic plant&lt;/a&gt;s. Not included are ectoparasites like &lt;a href=\"insects\"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mites\"&gt;mites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vertebrate\"&gt;vertebrate&lt;/a&gt;, or other &lt;a href=\"Plant%20defense%20against%20herbivory\"&gt;pests that affect plant health&lt;/a&gt; by eating plant tissues. Plant pathology also involves the study of pathogen identification, disease etiology, disease cycles, economic impact, &lt;a href=\"plant%20disease%20epidemiology\"&gt;plant disease epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plant%20disease%20resistance\"&gt;plant disease resistance&lt;/a&gt;, how plant diseases affect humans and animals, pathosystem genetics, and management of plant diseases.\nOverview.\nControl of plant diseases is crucial to the reliable production of food, and it provides significant problems in agricultural use of land, water, fuel and other inputs. Plants in both natural and cultivated populations carry inherent disease resistance, but there are numerous examples of devastating plant disease impacts, such as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Great Famine&lt;/a&gt; of Ireland and &lt;a href=\"chestnut%20blight\"&gt;chestnut blight&lt;/a&gt;, as well as recurrent severe plant diseases like &lt;a href=\"rice%20blast\"&gt;rice blast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soybean%20cyst%20nematode\"&gt;soybean cyst nematode&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"citrus%20canker\"&gt;citrus canker&lt;/a&gt;. \nHowever, disease control is reasonably successful for most crops. It is achieved by use of plants that have been bred for good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as &lt;a href=\"crop%20rotation\"&gt;crop rotation&lt;/a&gt;, use of pathogen-free seed, appropriate planting date and &lt;a href=\"plant%20density\"&gt;plant density&lt;/a&gt;, control of field moisture, and application of &lt;a href=\"pesticide\"&gt;pesticide&lt;/a&gt;s. Continuing advances in the science of plant pathology are needed to improve disease control, to keep up with the ongoing evolution and movement of plant pathogens, and to keep pace with changes in agricultural practices.\nPlant diseases cause major economic losses for farmers worldwide - see &lt;a href=\"%23Economic%20impact\"&gt;Economic impact&lt;/a&gt;. Across large regions and many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed settings, but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings. The &lt;a href=\"Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization\"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates that pests and diseases are responsible for about 25% of crop loss. To solve this, new methods are needed to detect diseases and pests early, such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and &lt;a href=\"spectroscopy\"&gt;spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"biophotonics\"&gt;biophotonics&lt;/a&gt; that are able to diagnose plant health and &lt;a href=\"metabolism\"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlant pathogens.\nIn most &lt;a href=\"pathosystem\"&gt;pathosystem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"virulence\"&gt;virulence&lt;/a&gt; is dependent on &lt;a href=\"hydrolase\"&gt;hydrolase&lt;/a&gt;s - and the wider class of &lt;a href=\"cell%20wall%20degrading%20protein\"&gt;cell wall degrading protein&lt;/a&gt;s - that degrade the &lt;a href=\"cell%20wall\"&gt;cell wall&lt;/a&gt;. The vast majority of CWDPs are pathogen-produced and &lt;a href=\"pectin\"&gt;pectin&lt;/a&gt;-targeted (for example, &lt;a href=\"pectinesterase\"&gt;pectinesterase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pectate%20lyase\"&gt;pectate lyase&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pectinase\"&gt;pectinase&lt;/a&gt;s). For microbes the cell wall &lt;a href=\"polysaccharide\"&gt;polysaccharide&lt;/a&gt;s are themselves a food source, but mostly just a barrier to be overcome.\nMany pathogens also grow opportunistically when the host breaks down its own cell walls, most often during &lt;a href=\"fruit%20ripening\"&gt;fruit ripening&lt;/a&gt;.\nFungi.\nMost phytopathogenic fungi belong to the &lt;a href=\"Ascomycetes\"&gt;Ascomycetes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Basidiomycetes\"&gt;Basidiomycetes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fungi reproduce both &lt;a href=\"sexual%20reproduction\"&gt;sexually&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"asexual%20reproduction\"&gt;asexually&lt;/a&gt; via the production of &lt;a href=\"spores\"&gt;spores&lt;/a&gt; and other structures. Spores may be spread long distances by air or water, or they may be soil borne. Many soil inhabiting fungi are capable of living &lt;a href=\"saprotroph\"&gt;saprotroph&lt;/a&gt;ically, carrying out the part of their life cycle in the &lt;a href=\"soil\"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt;. These are facultative saprotrophs.\nFungal diseases may be controlled through the use of &lt;a href=\"fungicides\"&gt;fungicides&lt;/a&gt; and other agriculture practices. However, new &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28biology%29\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; of fungi often &lt;a href=\"evolution\"&gt;evolve&lt;/a&gt; that are resistant to various fungicides.\nBiotrophic fungal pathogens colonize living plant tissue and obtain nutrients from living host cells. &lt;a href=\"Necrotroph\"&gt;Necrotroph&lt;/a&gt;ic fungal pathogens infect and kill host tissue and extract nutrients from the dead host cells. Significant fungal plant pathogens include:\nFungus-like organisms.\nOomycetes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"oomycetes\"&gt;oomycetes&lt;/a&gt; are fungus-like organisms. They include some of the most destructive plant pathogens including the &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Phytophthora\"&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/a&gt;\", which includes the causal agents of &lt;a href=\"Phytophthora%20infestans\"&gt;potato late blight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sudden%20oak%20death\"&gt;sudden oak death&lt;/a&gt;. Particular species of oomycetes are responsible for &lt;a href=\"root%20rot\"&gt;root rot&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite not being closely related to the fungi, the oomycetes have developed similar infection strategies. Oomycetes are capable of using effector proteins to turn off a plant's defenses in its infection process. Plant pathologists commonly group them with fungal pathogens.\nSignificant oomycete plant pathogens include:\nPhytomyxea.\nSome &lt;a href=\"slime%20mold\"&gt;slime mold&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Phytomyxea\"&gt;Phytomyxea&lt;/a&gt; cause important diseases, including &lt;a href=\"club%20root\"&gt;club root&lt;/a&gt; in cabbage and its relatives and &lt;a href=\"powdery%20scab\"&gt;powdery scab&lt;/a&gt; in potatoes. These are caused by species of \"&lt;a href=\"Plasmodiophora\"&gt;Plasmodiophora&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Spongospora\"&gt;Spongospora&lt;/a&gt;\", respectively.\nBacteria.\nMost &lt;a href=\"bacteria\"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that are associated with plants are actually &lt;a href=\"saprotrophic\"&gt;saprotrophic&lt;/a&gt; and do no harm to the plant itself. However, a small number, around 100 known species, are able to cause disease. Bacterial diseases are much more prevalent in &lt;a href=\"subtropical\"&gt;subtropical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tropical\"&gt;tropical&lt;/a&gt; regions of the world.\nMost plant pathogenic bacteria are rod-shaped (&lt;a href=\"Bacteria%23Morphology\"&gt;bacilli&lt;/a&gt;). In order to be able to colonize the plant they have specific pathogenicity factors. Five main types of bacterial pathogenicity factors are known: uses of cell wall\u2013degrading enzymes, &lt;a href=\"toxins\"&gt;toxins&lt;/a&gt;, effector proteins, &lt;a href=\"phytohormones\"&gt;phytohormones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"exopolysaccharide\"&gt;exopolysaccharide&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPathogens such as \"&lt;a href=\"Erwinia\"&gt;Erwinia&lt;/a&gt;\" species use cell wall\u2013degrading enzymes to cause &lt;a href=\"Bacterial%20soft%20rot\"&gt;soft rot&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Agrobacterium\"&gt;Agrobacterium&lt;/a&gt;\" species change the level of &lt;a href=\"auxin\"&gt;auxin&lt;/a&gt;s to cause tumours with phytohormones. &lt;a href=\"Exopolysaccharide\"&gt;Exopolysaccharide&lt;/a&gt;s are produced by bacteria and block &lt;a href=\"xylem\"&gt;xylem&lt;/a&gt; vessels, often leading to the death of the plant.\nBacteria control the production of &lt;a href=\"pathogenicity%20factors\"&gt;pathogenicity factors&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"quorum%20sensing\"&gt;quorum sensing&lt;/a&gt;.\nSignificant bacterial plant pathogens:\nPhytoplasmas and spiroplasmas.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Phytoplasma\"&gt;Phytoplasma&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Spiroplasma\"&gt;Spiroplasma&lt;/a&gt;\" are genera of bacteria that lack cell walls and are related to the &lt;a href=\"mycoplasmas\"&gt;mycoplasmas&lt;/a&gt;, which are human pathogens. Together they are referred to as the &lt;a href=\"mollicutes\"&gt;mollicutes&lt;/a&gt;. They also tend to have smaller &lt;a href=\"genomes\"&gt;genomes&lt;/a&gt; than most other bacteria. They are normally transmitted by sap-sucking &lt;a href=\"insects\"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt;, being transferred into the plant's &lt;a href=\"phloem\"&gt;phloem&lt;/a&gt; where it reproduces.\nViruses, viroids and virus-like organisms.\nThere are many types of &lt;a href=\"plant%20virus\"&gt;plant virus&lt;/a&gt;es, and some are &lt;a href=\"asymptomatic\"&gt;asymptomatic&lt;/a&gt; or latent. Under normal circumstances, plant viruses cause only a loss of &lt;a href=\"crop%20yield\"&gt;crop yield&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, it is not economically viable to try to control them, the exception being when they infect &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; species, such as fruit trees.\nMost plant viruses have small, single-stranded &lt;a href=\"RNA\"&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"genome\"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt;s. However some plant viruses also have double stranded &lt;a href=\"RNA\"&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt; or single or double stranded &lt;a href=\"DNA\"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; genomes. These genomes may encode only three or four &lt;a href=\"proteins\"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt;: a &lt;a href=\"replicase\"&gt;replicase&lt;/a&gt;, a coat protein, a &lt;a href=\"movement%20protein\"&gt;movement protein&lt;/a&gt;, in order to allow cell to cell movement through &lt;a href=\"plasmodesmata\"&gt;plasmodesmata&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes a protein that allows transmission by a vector. Plant viruses can have several more proteins and employ many different molecular translation methods.\nPlant viruses are generally transmitted from plant to plant by a &lt;a href=\"Vector%20%28epidemiology%29\"&gt;vector&lt;/a&gt;, but mechanical and seed transmission also occur. Vector transmission is often by an &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt; (for example, &lt;a href=\"aphid\"&gt;aphid&lt;/a&gt;s), but some &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nematode\"&gt;nematode&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"protozoa\"&gt;protozoa&lt;/a&gt; have been shown to be viral vectors. In many cases, the insect and virus are specific for virus transmission such as the &lt;a href=\"beet%20leafhopper\"&gt;beet leafhopper&lt;/a&gt; that transmits the &lt;a href=\"curly%20top\"&gt;curly top&lt;/a&gt; virus causing disease in several crop plants. One example is mosaic disease of tobacco where leaves are dwarfed and the chlorophyll of the leaves is destroyed. Another example is Bunchy top of banana, where the plant is dwarfed, and the upper leaves form a tight rosette.\nNematodes.\n&lt;a href=\"Nematodes\"&gt;Nematodes&lt;/a&gt; are small, multicellular, wormlike animals. Many live freely in the soil, but there are some species that parasitize plant &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;s. They are a problem in &lt;a href=\"tropical\"&gt;tropical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"subtropical\"&gt;subtropical&lt;/a&gt; regions of the world, where they may infect &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt;. Potato cyst nematodes (\"Globodera pallida\" and \"G. rostochiensis\") are widely distributed in Europe and North and South America and cause worth of damage in Europe every year. Root knot nematodes have quite a large host range, they parasitize plant root systems and thus directly affect the uptake of water and nutrients needed for normal plant growth and reproduction, whereas cyst nematodes tend to be able to infect only a few species. Nematodes are able to cause radical changes in root cells in order to facilitate their lifestyle.\nProtozoa and algae.\nThere are a few examples of plant diseases caused by &lt;a href=\"protozoa\"&gt;protozoa&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., \"&lt;a href=\"Phytomonas\"&gt;Phytomonas&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"Kinetoplastida\"&gt;kinetoplastid&lt;/a&gt;). They are transmitted as durable &lt;a href=\"zoospore\"&gt;zoospore&lt;/a&gt;s that may be able to survive in a resting state in the soil for many years. Further, they can transmit plant &lt;a href=\"viruses\"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;. When the motile zoospores come into contact with a &lt;a href=\"root%20hair\"&gt;root hair&lt;/a&gt; they produce a &lt;a href=\"plasmodium\"&gt;plasmodium&lt;/a&gt; which invades the &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSome colourless parasitic &lt;a href=\"algae\"&gt;algae&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., \"&lt;a href=\"Cephaleuros\"&gt;Cephaleuros&lt;/a&gt;\") also cause plant diseases.\nParasitic plants.\nParasitic plants such as &lt;a href=\"broomrape\"&gt;broomrape&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mistletoe\"&gt;mistletoe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cuscuta\"&gt;dodder&lt;/a&gt; are included in the study of phytopathology. Dodder, for example, can be a conduit for the transmission of viruses or virus-like agents from a host plant to a plant that is not typically a host, or for an agent that is not graft-transmissible.\nPhysiological plant disorders.\nSome abiotic disorders can be confused with pathogen-induced disorders. Abiotic causes include natural processes such as &lt;a href=\"drought\"&gt;drought&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hail\"&gt;hail&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"flood\"&gt;flood&lt;/a&gt;ing and poor drainage; &lt;a href=\"Micronutrient%20deficiency\"&gt;nutrient deficiency&lt;/a&gt;; deposition of mineral salts such as &lt;a href=\"sodium%20chloride\"&gt;sodium chloride&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gypsum\"&gt;gypsum&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"wind\"&gt;wind&lt;/a&gt;burn and breakage by storms; and &lt;a href=\"wildfire\"&gt;wildfire&lt;/a&gt;s. Similar disorders (usually classed as abiotic) can be caused by human intervention, resulting in &lt;a href=\"soil\"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt; compaction, &lt;a href=\"pollution\"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; of air and soil, &lt;a href=\"Soil%20salinity%23Salinity%20due%20to%20irrigation\"&gt;salinization caused by irrigation&lt;/a&gt; and road salting, over-application of &lt;a href=\"herbicide\"&gt;herbicide&lt;/a&gt;s, clumsy handling (e.g. lawnmower damage to trees), and &lt;a href=\"vandalism\"&gt;vandalism&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpidemiology.\nEpidemiology: The study of factors affecting the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases.\nA disease tetrahedron (disease pyramid) best captures the elements involved with plant diseases. This pyramid uses the disease triangle as a foundation, consisting of elements such as: host, pathogen and environment. In addition to these three elements, humans and time add the remaining elements to create a disease tetrahedron.\nHistory: Plant disease epidemics that are historically known based on tremendous losses:\n- Irish potato late blight\n- Dutch elm disease \n- Chestnut blight in North America\nFactors affecting epidemics:\nHost: Resistance or susceptibility level, age, and genetics.\nPathogen: Amount of inoculum, genetics, and type of reproduction\nDisease resistance.\nPlant disease resistance is the ability of a plant to prevent and terminate infections from plant pathogens.\nStructures that help plants prevent disease are: cuticular layer, cell walls and stomata guard cells. These act as a barrier to prevent pathogens from entering the plant host.\nOnce diseases have overcome these barriers, plant receptors initiate signaling pathways to create molecules to compete against the foreign molecules. These pathways are influenced and triggered by genes within the host plant and are susceptible to being manipulated by genetic breeding to create varieties of plants that are resistant to destructive pathogens.\nAmong defense mechanisms, chemical deterrence of pest settling and feeding, like the induction of defensive compounds, may be a key strategy for reducing herbivore damage.\nManagement.\nDomestic quarantine.\nA diseased patch of vegetation or individual plants can be isolated from other, healthy growth. Specimens may be destroyed or relocated into a greenhouse for treatment or study.\nPort and border inspection and quarantine.\nAnother option is to avoid the introduction of harmful nonnative organisms by controlling all human traffic and activity (e.g., the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Quarantine%20and%20Inspection%20Service\"&gt;Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service&lt;/a&gt;), although legislation and enforcement are crucial in order to ensure lasting effectiveness. Today's volume of global trade is providing\u2014and will continue to provide\u2014unprecedented opportunities for the introduction of plant pests. In the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, even to get a better \"estimate\" of the number of such introductions, and thus the need to impose port and border quarantine and inspection, would require a substantial increase in inspections. In &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; a similar shortcoming of understanding has a different origin: Port inspections are not very useful because inspectors know too little about taxonomy. There are often pests that the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Government\"&gt;Australian Government&lt;/a&gt; has prioritised as harmful to be kept out of the country, but which have near taxonomic relatives that confuse the issue. And inspectors also run into the opposite - harmless natives, or undiscovered natives, or just-discovered natives they need not bother with but which are easy to confuse with their outlawed foreign family members.\n&lt;a href=\"X-ray\"&gt;X-ray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Electron-beam%20processing\"&gt;electron-beam&lt;/a&gt;/E-beam &lt;a href=\"food%20irradiation\"&gt;irradiation of food&lt;/a&gt; has been trialed as a quarantine treatment for &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"commodity\"&gt;commodities&lt;/a&gt; originating from &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;. The US FDA (&lt;a href=\"Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration\"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;), USDA APHIS (&lt;a href=\"Animal%20and%20Plant%20Health%20Inspection%20Service\"&gt;Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service&lt;/a&gt;), producers, and consumers were all accepting of the results - more thorough pest eradication and lesser taste degradation than heat treatment.\nCultural.\nFarming in some societies is kept on a small scale, tended by peoples whose culture includes farming traditions going back to ancient times. (An example of such traditions would be lifelong training in techniques of plot terracing, weather anticipation and response, fertilization, grafting, seed care, and dedicated gardening.) Plants that are intently monitored often benefit from not only active external protection but also a greater overall vigor. While primitive in the sense of being the most labor-intensive solution by far, where practical or necessary it is more than adequate.\nPlant resistance.\nSophisticated agricultural developments now allow growers to choose from among systematically cross-bred species to ensure the greatest hardiness in their crops, as suited for a particular region's pathological profile. Breeding practices have been perfected over centuries, but with the advent of genetic manipulation even finer control of a crop's immunity traits is possible. The engineering of food plants may be less rewarding, however, as higher output is frequently offset by popular suspicion and negative opinion about this \"tampering\" with nature.\nChemical.\nMany natural and synthetic compounds can be employed to combat the above threats. This method works by directly eliminating disease-causing organisms or curbing their spread; however, it has been shown to have too broad an effect, typically, to be good for the local ecosystem. From an economic standpoint, all but the simplest natural additives may disqualify a product from \"organic\" status, potentially reducing the value of the yield.\nBiological.\n&lt;a href=\"Crop%20rotation\"&gt;Crop rotation&lt;/a&gt; may be an effective means to prevent a parasitic population from becoming well-established. For example, protection against infection by \"&lt;a href=\"Agrobacterium%20tumefaciens\"&gt;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&lt;/a&gt;\", which causes gall diseases in many plants, by dipping cuttings in suspensions of \"&lt;a href=\"Agrobacterium%20radiobacter\"&gt;Agrobacterium radiobacter&lt;/a&gt;\" before inserting them in the ground to take root. Other means to undermine parasites without attacking them directly may exist.\nIntegrated.\nThe use of two or more of these methods in combination offers a higher chance of effectiveness.\nEconomic impact.\n the most costly diseases of the most produced crops worldwide are:\nHistory.\nPlant pathology has developed from antiquity, starting with &lt;a href=\"Theophrastus\"&gt;Theophrastus&lt;/a&gt;, but scientific study began in the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Modern\"&gt;Early Modern&lt;/a&gt; period with the invention of the &lt;a href=\"microscope\"&gt;microscope&lt;/a&gt;, and developed in the 19th century.
