    "text": "Harry Augustus \"Hal\" Garfield (October 11, 1863 \u2013 December 12, 1942) was an American lawyer, academic, and public official. He was president of &lt;a href=\"Williams%20College\"&gt;Williams College&lt;/a&gt; and supervised the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fuel%20Administration\"&gt;United States Fuel Administration&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. He was a son of &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"James%20A.%20Garfield\"&gt;James A. Garfield&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nHarry Augustus Garfield was born on October 11, 1863, in &lt;a href=\"Hiram%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Hiram, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; to future &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; (then General in the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army\"&gt;Union Army&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"James%20A.%20Garfield\"&gt;James A. Garfield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;First Lady&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lucretia%20Garfield\"&gt;Lucretia Garfield&lt;/a&gt;. His mother named him in May 1864 after two of James Garfield's friends. His father called him \"little Chickamauga\" because he was born shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Chickamauga\"&gt;Battle of Chickamauga&lt;/a&gt;. He went by the nickname of \"Hal\".\nGarfield attended public school, a private academy and was tutored at home. In 1879, he was sent to &lt;a href=\"St.%20Paul%27s%20School%20%28New%20Hampshire%29\"&gt;St. Paul's School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Concord, New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, but at the beginning of his final year he moved to &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; to be taught by a private tutor at the &lt;a href=\"White%20House\"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;. At the age of 17 he and his 15-year-old brother &lt;a href=\"James%20Rudolph%20Garfield\"&gt;James Rudolph Garfield&lt;/a&gt; watched in horror as their father was &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20of%20James%20A.%20Garfield\"&gt;shot down&lt;/a&gt; by assassin &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Guiteau\"&gt;Charles Guiteau&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarfield graduated from &lt;a href=\"Williams%20College\"&gt;Williams College&lt;/a&gt; in 1885 with a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Bachelor of Arts&lt;/a&gt; degree. At Williams, he was a member of &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Delta%20Phi\"&gt;Alpha Delta Phi&lt;/a&gt;. He went on to study law at &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20Law%20School\"&gt;Columbia Law School&lt;/a&gt;, spending his second year reading law at &lt;a href=\"All%20Soul%27s%20College\"&gt;All Soul's College&lt;/a&gt; in Oxford and the Inns Court in London.\nCareer.\nGarfield taught Roman history and Latin for a year at St. Paul's School after graduating Williams. From 1888 to 1895, he practiced law with his brother James in &lt;a href=\"Cleveland\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; with the firm \"Garfield, Garfield &amp; Howe\". He was professor of contracts at &lt;a href=\"Case%20Western%20Reserve%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Western Reserve Law School&lt;/a&gt; from 1891 to 1897. In 1893, Garfield became a charter member of the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce and in 1896 helped to organize and served as first president of the Cleveland Municipal Association. He also served as president of the Chamber of Commerce from 1898 to 1899. From 1900 to 1906, Garfield managed a syndicate for railroad companies in Ohio. He was professor of politics at &lt;a href=\"Princeton%20University\"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; from 1903 to 1908. While at Princeton, he befriended future president &lt;a href=\"Woodrow%20Wilson\"&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt;. In 1908, Garfield became a &lt;a href=\"law%20professor\"&gt;law professor&lt;/a&gt; and eighth president of his &lt;a href=\"alma%20mater\"&gt;alma mater&lt;/a&gt;, Williams College in &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld War I.\n&lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Hoover\"&gt;Herbert Hoover&lt;/a&gt;, then head of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Food%20Administration\"&gt;U.S. Food Administration&lt;/a&gt;, called Garfield to become chairman of the price-fixing committee of the Food Administration. He also served on the price-fixing committee of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Industries%20Board\"&gt;War Industries Board&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 1917, President &lt;a href=\"Woodrow%20Wilson\"&gt;Woodrow Wilson&lt;/a&gt; asked him to run the nation's &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fuel%20Administration\"&gt;United States Fuel Administration&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, and he took a leave of absence from his duties as president of Williams. Garfield's duty was to conserve the coal supply and keep the price within reasonable bounds. Local committees were appointed throughout the country to study local conditions and their reports formed the basis for the prices fixed in different localities. The ensuing winter was unusually severe, and serious shortage of coal threatened. Because of the shortage of coal in the &lt;a href=\"northeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;northeastern United States&lt;/a&gt;, especially in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, Garfield's administration of the office was severely criticized in the press, but an investigation by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; showed that the shortage was due to failure of the railroads to meet the extra demands upon them, and federal control of the roads was instituted on December 28, 1917.\nGarfield also issued his \"idle Mondays\" order in January 1918, which closed non-essential industries for five consecutive days beginning January 18 and on every Monday thereafter up to March 25. This roused a storm of protest from many manufacturers, and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt; voted a resolution, requesting postponement, but this reached him after the order had been signed. On February 14, however, the order was suspended and priority for certain shipments substituted. He disapproved of the method of settling the coal strike in December 1919 and resigned his office, resuming that of president of Williams College.\nLater career.\nAfter the war, Garfield returned to serve as president of Williams College. During his tenure, he helped establish the &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20Politics%20at%20Williams%20College\"&gt;Institute of Politics&lt;/a&gt; at Williams. He served as president until his retirement in June 1934.\nHe was president of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Political%20Science%20Association\"&gt;American Political Science Association&lt;/a&gt; from 1921 to 1922.\nIn 1935, he studied international problems while living in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; In 1941, he accepted an appointment to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20War\"&gt;War Department&lt;/a&gt; Defense Board, a board focused on studying applications of the &lt;a href=\"Excess%20profits%20tax\"&gt;Excess Profits Law&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nGarfield married his second cousin, Belle Hartford Mason, on June 14, 1888. They had a double wedding with Garfield's sister Mollie and &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stanley%20Brown\"&gt;Joseph Stanley Brown&lt;/a&gt;. Garfield and his wife had four children with her: James, Mason, Lucretia and Stanton. After his retirement in 1934, he took a one-year trip around the world with his wife. After his return in 1935, he moved to Washington, D.C.\nHe was a hereditary companion of the Ohio Commandery of the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Order%20of%20the%20Loyal%20Legion%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States&lt;/a&gt; by right of his father's service as a major general in Union Army during the American Civil War.\nDeath.\nGarfield died on December 12, 1942, at his home in &lt;a href=\"Williamstown%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Williamstown, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. He was buried in the faculty cemetery at Williams College.\nAwards.\nFor his service as Fuel Administrator, Garfield was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Service%20Medal%20%28U.S.%20Army%29\"&gt;Distinguished Service Medal&lt;/a&gt; in 1921 by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War\"&gt;Secretary of War&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Newton%20D.%20Baker\"&gt;Newton D. Baker&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarfield was a recipient of honorary degrees from &lt;a href=\"Dartmouth%20College\"&gt;Dartmouth College&lt;/a&gt;, Princeton University, &lt;a href=\"Amherst%20College\"&gt;Amherst College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wesleyan%20University\"&gt;Wesleyan University&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20William%20and%20Mary\"&gt;College of William and Mary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whitman%20College\"&gt;Whitman College&lt;/a&gt;."
