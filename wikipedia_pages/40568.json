    "text": "The 1972 United States presidential election was the 47th quadrennial &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. It was held on Tuesday, November 7, 1972. Incumbent &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; from California defeated &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;U.S. Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20McGovern\"&gt;George McGovern&lt;/a&gt; of South Dakota. Until the &lt;a href=\"1984%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1984 election&lt;/a&gt;, this was the largest margin of victory in the Electoral College for a Republican in a U.S. presidential election, and as of 2020, it remains the largest margin of the popular vote won by any Republican presidential candidate. It was the first time when California had more electoral votes than New York.\nNixon easily swept aside challenges from two Republican congressmen in the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%201972\"&gt;1972 Republican primaries&lt;/a&gt; to win re-nomination. McGovern, who had played a significant role in &lt;a href=\"McGovern%E2%80%93Fraser%20Commission\"&gt;changing&lt;/a&gt; the Democratic nomination system after the &lt;a href=\"1968%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1968 election&lt;/a&gt;, mobilized the anti-&lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; movement and other liberal supporters to win his party's &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%201972\"&gt;nomination&lt;/a&gt;. Among the candidates he defeated were early front-runner &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Muskie\"&gt;Edmund Muskie&lt;/a&gt;, 1968 nominee &lt;a href=\"Hubert%20Humphrey\"&gt;Hubert Humphrey&lt;/a&gt;, and Congresswoman &lt;a href=\"Shirley%20Chisholm\"&gt;Shirley Chisholm&lt;/a&gt;, the first African-American person to run for a major party's presidential nomination.\nNixon emphasized the strong economy and his success in foreign affairs, while McGovern ran on a platform calling for an immediate end to the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;, and the institution of a &lt;a href=\"guaranteed%20minimum%20income\"&gt;guaranteed minimum income&lt;/a&gt;. Nixon maintained a large, and consistent, lead in polling. Separately, Nixon's &lt;a href=\"Committee%20for%20the%20Re-Election%20of%20the%20President\"&gt;re-election committee&lt;/a&gt; broke into the &lt;a href=\"Watergate%20complex\"&gt;Watergate complex&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"wiretap\"&gt;wiretap&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20National%20Committee\"&gt;Democratic National Committee&lt;/a&gt;'s headquarters, a scandal that would later be known as \"&lt;a href=\"Watergate\"&gt;Watergate&lt;/a&gt;\". McGovern's campaign was seriously damaged by the revelation that his running mate, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Eagleton\"&gt;Thomas Eagleton&lt;/a&gt;, had undergone &lt;a href=\"electroconvulsive%20therapy\"&gt;electroconvulsive therapy&lt;/a&gt; as a treatment for &lt;a href=\"clinical%20depression\"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. Eagleton was replaced on the ballot by &lt;a href=\"Sargent%20Shriver\"&gt;Sargent Shriver&lt;/a&gt;.\nNixon won the election in a &lt;a href=\"landslide%20victory\"&gt;landslide&lt;/a&gt;, taking 60.7% of the popular vote and carrying 49 states, while being the first Republican to sweep the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt;. McGovern took just 37.5% of the popular vote, while &lt;a href=\"John%20G.%20Schmitz\"&gt;John G. Schmitz&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Independent%20Party\"&gt;American Independent Party&lt;/a&gt; won 1.4% of the vote. Nixon received almost 18\u00a0million more votes than McGovern, and he holds the record for the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20United%20States%20presidential%20elections%20by%20popular%20vote%20margin\"&gt;widest popular vote margin&lt;/a&gt; in any post\u2013World War II United States presidential election. The 1972 presidential election was the first since the ratification of the &lt;a href=\"Twenty-sixth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;26th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. Within two years of the election, both Nixon and Vice President &lt;a href=\"Spiro%20Agnew\"&gt;Spiro Agnew&lt;/a&gt; resigned from office: the former in August 1974, due to Watergate, the latter in October 1973, due to a separate corruption charge. &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Ford\"&gt;Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt; succeeded Agnew as vice president, then, in the following year, succeeded Nixon as president, making him the only U.S. president in history not to be elected to the office on a presidential ticket.\n, this was the last time that &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; voted for the Republican candidate in a presidential election, the longest such streak for any state, and only once since then have &lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; done so, when they voted for &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Reagan\"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1984%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1984 election&lt;/a&gt;. This was also the most recent presidential election in which the entire &lt;a href=\"Midwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt; was won by a single candidate.\nDespite this election delivering Nixon's greatest electoral triumph, Nixon later wrote in his memoirs that \"it was one of the most frustrating and in many ways the least satisfying of all\".\nRepublican nomination.\nRepublican candidates:\nPrimaries.\nRichard Nixon was a popular incumbent president in 1972, as he was credited with opening the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; as a result of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon%27s%201972%20visit%20to%20China\"&gt;his visit&lt;/a&gt; that year, and achieving &lt;a href=\"d%C3%A9tente\"&gt;d\u00e9tente&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. Polls showed that Nixon held a strong lead in the Republican primaries. He was challenged by two candidates: &lt;a href=\"modern%20liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pete%20McCloskey\"&gt;Pete McCloskey&lt;/a&gt; from California, and &lt;a href=\"conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Ashbrook\"&gt;John Ashbrook&lt;/a&gt; from Ohio. McCloskey ran as an anti-war candidate, while Ashbrook opposed Nixon's &lt;a href=\"d%C3%A9tente\"&gt;d\u00e9tente&lt;/a&gt; policies towards &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire%20primary\"&gt;New Hampshire primary&lt;/a&gt;, McCloskey garnered 19.8% of the vote to Nixon's 67.6%, with Ashbrook receiving 9.7%. Nixon won 1323 of the 1324 delegates to the Republican convention, with McCloskey receiving the vote of one delegate from New Mexico. Vice President &lt;a href=\"Spiro%20Agnew\"&gt;Spiro Agnew&lt;/a&gt; was re-nominated by acclamation; while both the party's moderate wing and Nixon himself had wanted to replace him with a new running-mate (the moderates favoring &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20Rockefeller\"&gt;Nelson Rockefeller&lt;/a&gt;, and Nixon favoring &lt;a href=\"John%20Connally\"&gt;John Connally&lt;/a&gt;), it was ultimately concluded that such action would incur too great a risk of losing Agnew's base of conservative supporters.\nPrimary results.\nPrimaries popular vote result:\nConvention.\nSeven members of &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20Veterans%20Against%20the%20War\"&gt;Vietnam Veterans Against the War&lt;/a&gt; were brought on federal charges for conspiring to disrupt the Republican convention. They were acquitted by a federal jury in &lt;a href=\"Gainesville%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Gainesville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemocratic nomination.\nOverall, fifteen people declared their candidacy for the Democratic Party nomination. They were:\nPrimaries.\n&lt;a href=\"Party%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;Senate Majority Whip&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Kennedy\"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest brother of late &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; and late &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senator\"&gt;United States Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Robert%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, was the favorite to win the 1972\u00a0nomination, but he announced he would not be a candidate. The favorite for the Democratic nomination then became Senator &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Muskie\"&gt;Ed Muskie&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"1968%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt; vice-presidential nominee. Muskie's momentum collapsed just prior to the New Hampshire primary, when the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Canuck%20letter\"&gt;Canuck letter&lt;/a&gt;\" was published in the \"&lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Union-Leader\"&gt;Manchester Union-Leader&lt;/a&gt;\". The letter, actually a forgery from Nixon's \"dirty tricks\" unit, claimed that Muskie had made disparaging remarks about &lt;a href=\"French%20Canadian\"&gt;French-Canadians&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 a remark likely to injure Muskie's support among the French-American population in northern &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, the paper published an attack on the character of Muskie's wife Jane, reporting that she drank and used &lt;a href=\"Off-color%20humor\"&gt;off-color&lt;/a&gt; language during the campaign. Muskie made an emotional defense of his wife in a speech outside the newspaper's offices during a snowstorm. Though Muskie later stated that what had appeared to the press as tears were actually melted snowflakes, the press reported that Muskie broke down and cried, shattering the candidate's image as calm and reasoned.\nNearly two years before the election, South Dakota Senator &lt;a href=\"George%20McGovern\"&gt;George McGovern&lt;/a&gt; entered the race as an anti-war, progressive candidate. McGovern was able to pull together support from the anti-war movement and other grassroots support to win the nomination in a primary system he had played a significant part in designing.\nOn January 25, 1972, New York Representative Shirley Chisholm announced she would run, and became the first African-American woman to run for the Democratic or Republican presidential nomination. Hawaii Representative Patsy Mink also announced she would run, and became the first Asian American person to run for the Democratic presidential nomination.\nOn April 25, George McGovern won the Massachusetts primary. Two days later, journalist &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Novak\"&gt;Robert Novak&lt;/a&gt; quoted a \"Democratic senator\", later revealed to be Thomas Eagleton, as saying: \"The people don't know McGovern is for amnesty, abortion, and legalization of pot. Once middle America \u2013 Catholic middle America, in particular \u2013 finds this out, he's dead.\" The label stuck, and McGovern became known as the candidate of \"amnesty, abortion, and acid\". It became Humphrey's battle cry to stop McGovern\u2014especially in the Nebraska primary.\n&lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Alabama\"&gt;Alabama Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20Wallace\"&gt;George Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, an infamous segregationist who ran on a third-party ticket in &lt;a href=\"1968%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt;, did well in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt; (winning nearly every county in the Florida primary) and among alienated and dissatisfied voters in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20United%20States\"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt;. What might have become a forceful campaign was cut short when &lt;a href=\"George%20Wallace%231972%20Democratic%20presidential%20primaries%20and%20assassination%20attempt\"&gt;Wallace was shot&lt;/a&gt; in an assassination attempt by &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Bremer\"&gt;Arthur Bremer&lt;/a&gt; on May 15. Wallace was struck by five bullets and left &lt;a href=\"paralysis\"&gt;paralyzed&lt;/a&gt; from the waist down. The day after the assassination attempt, Wallace won the Michigan and Maryland primaries, but the shooting effectively ended his campaign, and he pulled out in July.\nIn the end, McGovern won the nomination by winning primaries through grass-roots support, in spite of establishment opposition. McGovern had led a commission to re-design the Democratic nomination system after the divisive nomination struggle and convention of &lt;a href=\"1968%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt;. However, the new rules angered many prominent Democrats whose influence was marginalized, and those politicians refused to support McGovern's campaign (some even supporting Nixon instead), leaving the McGovern campaign at a significant disadvantage in funding, compared to Nixon. Some of the principles of the McGovern Commission have lasted throughout every subsequent nomination contest, but the Hunt Commission instituted the selection of &lt;a href=\"Superdelegates\"&gt;Superdelegates&lt;/a&gt; a decade later, in order to reduce the nomination chances of outsiders like McGovern and Carter.\nPrimary results.\nPrimaries popular vote results:\n1972 Democratic National Convention.\nResults:\nVice presidential vote.\nMost polls showed McGovern running well behind incumbent President &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt;, except when McGovern was paired with &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Kennedy\"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. McGovern and his campaign brain trust lobbied Kennedy heavily to accept the bid to be McGovern's &lt;a href=\"running%20mate\"&gt;running mate&lt;/a&gt;, but he continually refused their advances, and instead suggested &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Representative\"&gt;U.S. Representative&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=\"House%20Ways%20and%20Means%20Committee\"&gt;House Ways and Means Committee&lt;/a&gt; chairman) &lt;a href=\"Wilbur%20Mills\"&gt;Wilbur Mills&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arkansas\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Boston\"&gt;Boston Mayor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20White%20%28mayor%29\"&gt;Kevin White&lt;/a&gt;. Offers were then made to &lt;a href=\"Hubert%20Humphrey\"&gt;Hubert Humphrey&lt;/a&gt;, Connecticut Senator &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Ribicoff\"&gt;Abraham Ribicoff&lt;/a&gt;, and Minnesota Senator &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Mondale\"&gt;Walter Mondale&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom turned it down. Finally, the vice presidential slot was offered to Senator &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Eagleton\"&gt;Thomas Eagleton&lt;/a&gt; of Missouri, who accepted the offer.\nWith hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Delegate%20%28American%20politics%29\"&gt;delegate&lt;/a&gt;s displeased with McGovern, the vote to ratify Eagleton's candidacy was chaotic, with at least three other candidates having their names put into nomination and votes scattered over 70 candidates. A grass-roots attempt to displace Eagleton in favor of Texas state representative &lt;a href=\"Frances%20Farenthold\"&gt;Frances Farenthold&lt;/a&gt; gained significant traction, though was ultimately unable to change the outcome of the vote.\nThe vice-presidential balloting went on so long that McGovern and Eagleton were forced to begin making their acceptance speeches at around 2 am, local time.\nAfter the convention ended, it was discovered that Eagleton had undergone psychiatric &lt;a href=\"electroshock%20therapy\"&gt;electroshock therapy&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"clinical%20depression\"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and had concealed this information from McGovern. A \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine poll taken at the time found that 77 percent of the respondents said, \"Eagleton's medical record would not affect their vote.\" Nonetheless, the press made frequent references to his \"shock therapy\", and McGovern feared that this would detract from his campaign platform. McGovern subsequently consulted confidentially with pre-eminent psychiatrists, including Eagleton's own doctors, who advised him that a recurrence of Eagleton's depression was possible and could endanger the country, should Eagleton become president. McGovern had initially claimed that he would back Eagleton \"1000 percent\", only to ask Eagleton to withdraw three days later. This perceived lack of conviction in sticking with his running mate was disastrous for the McGovern campaign.\nMcGovern later approached six different prominent Democrats to run for vice-president: Ted Kennedy, &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Muskie\"&gt;Edmund Muskie&lt;/a&gt;, Hubert Humphrey, &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Ribicoff\"&gt;Abraham Ribicoff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Larry%20O%27Brien\"&gt;Larry O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reubin%20Askew\"&gt;Reubin Askew&lt;/a&gt;. All six declined. &lt;a href=\"Sargent%20Shriver\"&gt;Sargent Shriver&lt;/a&gt;, brother-in-law to John, Robert, and Ted Kennedy, former &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20France\"&gt;Ambassador to France&lt;/a&gt;, and former &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Corps%23Directors\"&gt;Director&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Corps\"&gt;Peace Corps&lt;/a&gt;, later accepted. He was officially nominated by a special session of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20National%20Committee\"&gt;Democratic National Committee&lt;/a&gt;. By this time, McGovern's poll ratings had plunged from 41 to 24 percent.\nThird parties.\nThe only major &lt;a href=\"third%20party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;third party&lt;/a&gt; candidate in the 1972 election was conservative Republican Representative &lt;a href=\"John%20G.%20Schmitz\"&gt;John G. Schmitz&lt;/a&gt;, who ran on the &lt;a href=\"American%20Independent%20Party\"&gt;American Independent Party&lt;/a&gt; ticket (the party on whose ballot &lt;a href=\"George%20Wallace\"&gt;George Wallace&lt;/a&gt; ran in 1968). He was on the ballot in 32 states and received 1,099,482 votes. Unlike Wallace, however, he did not win a majority of votes cast in any state, and received no electoral votes, although he did finish ahead of McGovern in four of the most conservative &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20Idaho%2C%201972\"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; counties. Schmitz's performance in archconservative &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%20County%2C%20Idaho\"&gt;Jefferson County&lt;/a&gt; was the best by a third-party Presidential candidate in any &lt;a href=\"slave%20states%20and%20free%20states\"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; or postbellum state county since 1936 when &lt;a href=\"William%20Lemke\"&gt;William Lemke&lt;/a&gt; reached over twenty-eight percent of the vote in the North Dakota counties of &lt;a href=\"Burke%20County%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Burke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheridan%20County%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Sheridan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hettinger%20County%2C%20North%20Dakota\"&gt;Hettinger&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"John%20Hospers\"&gt;John Hospers&lt;/a&gt; and Tonie Nathan of the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Libertarian%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Libertarian Party&lt;/a&gt; were on the ballot only in Colorado and &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, but were official write-in candidates in four others, and received 3,674 votes, winning no states. However, they did receive one Electoral College vote from &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; from a Republican &lt;a href=\"faithless%20elector\"&gt;faithless elector&lt;/a&gt; (see below). The Libertarian vice-presidential nominee &lt;a href=\"Tonie%20Nathan\"&gt;Theodora \"Tonie\" Nathan&lt;/a&gt; became the first &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt; and the first woman in U.S. history to receive an Electoral College vote.\n&lt;a href=\"Linda%20Jenness\"&gt;Linda Jenness&lt;/a&gt; was nominated by the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Socialist Workers Party&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Pulley\"&gt;Andrew Pulley&lt;/a&gt; as her running-mate. &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Spock\"&gt;Benjamin Spock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Hobson\"&gt;Julius Hobson&lt;/a&gt; were nominated for president and vice-president, respectively, by the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201970s%29\"&gt;People's Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral election.\nCampaign.\nMcGovern ran on a platform of immediately ending the Vietnam War and instituting &lt;a href=\"guaranteed%20minimum%20income\"&gt;guaranteed minimum income&lt;/a&gt;s for the nation's poor. His campaign was harmed by his views during the primaries (which alienated many powerful Democrats), the perception that his foreign policy was too extreme, and the Eagleton debacle. With McGovern's campaign weakened by these factors, the Republicans successfully portrayed him as a radical left-wing extremist incompetent to serve as president. Nixon &lt;a href=\"Historical%20polling%20for%20U.S.%20Presidential%20elections%231972%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;led in the polls&lt;/a&gt; by large margins throughout the entire campaign. With an enormous fundraising advantage and a comfortable lead in the polls, Nixon concentrated on large rallies and focused speeches to closed, select audiences, leaving much of the retail campaigning to surrogates like Vice President Agnew. Nixon did not, by design, try to extend his coattails to Republican congressional or gubernatorial candidates, preferring to pad his own margin of victory.\nResults.\nNixon's percentage of the popular vote was only marginally less than Lyndon Johnson's record in the &lt;a href=\"1964%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1964 election&lt;/a&gt;, and his margin of victory was slightly larger. Nixon won a majority vote in 49 states, including McGovern's home state of &lt;a href=\"South%20Dakota\"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;. Only &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"District%20of%20Columbia\"&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt; voted for the challenger, resulting in an even more lopsided &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Electoral College&lt;/a&gt; tally. McGovern garnered only 37.5 percent of the national popular vote, the lowest share received by a Democratic Party nominee since &lt;a href=\"John%20W.%20Davis\"&gt;John W. Davis&lt;/a&gt; won only 28.8 percent of the vote in the &lt;a href=\"1924%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1924 election&lt;/a&gt;. The only major party candidate since 1972 to receive less than 40 percent of the vote was Republican incumbent President &lt;a href=\"George%20H.%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; who won 37.4 percent of the vote in the &lt;a href=\"1992%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1992 election&lt;/a&gt;, a race that (as in 1924) was complicated by a strong &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20third%20party%20performances%20in%20United%20States%20presidential%20elections\"&gt;third party vote&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the McGovern campaign believed that its candidate had a better chance of defeating Nixon because of the new &lt;a href=\"Twenty-sixth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution&lt;/a&gt; that lowered the national voting age to 18 from 21, most of the youth vote went to Nixon. This was the first election in American history in which a &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28U.S.%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; candidate carried every single &lt;a href=\"American%20South\"&gt;Southern state&lt;/a&gt;, continuing the region's transformation from &lt;a href=\"Solid%20South\"&gt;a Democratic bastion&lt;/a&gt; into a Republican stronghold as &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20presidential%20elections%20in%20Arkansas\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; was carried by a Republican presidential candidate for the first time in a century. By this time, all the Southern states, except Arkansas and Texas, had been carried by a Republican in either the previous election or the one in 1964 (although Republican candidates carried Texas in 1928, 1952 and 1956). As a result of this election, Massachusetts became the only state that Nixon did not carry in any of the three presidential elections in which he was a candidate. This is one of only two elections since 1856 that Massachusetts and Rhode Island did not support the same candidate. The other election which the two states did not do so is 1980.\nThis presidential election was the first since &lt;a href=\"1808%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1808&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; did not have the largest number of electors in the Electoral College, having fallen to 41 electors vs. &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;'s 45. Additionally, through &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; it remains the last one in which Minnesota was carried by the Republican candidate.\nMcGovern won a mere 130 counties, plus the District of Columbia and four county-equivalents in Alaska, easily the fewest counties won by any major-party presidential nominee since the advent of popular presidential elections. In nineteen states, McGovern failed to carry a single county; he carried a mere one county-equivalent in a further nine states, and just two counties in a further seven. In contrast to &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Mondale\"&gt;Walter Mondale&lt;/a&gt;'s narrow 1984 win in Minnesota, McGovern comfortably did win Massachusetts, but lost every other state by no less than five percentage points, as well as 45 states by more than ten percentage points \u2013 the exceptions being Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and his home state of South Dakota. This election also made Nixon the second former vice president in American history to serve two terms back-to-back, after &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Jefferson\"&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1800%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1800&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1804%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1804&lt;/a&gt;. Since McGovern carried only one state, bumper stickers reading \"Nixon 49 America 1\", \"Don't Blame Me, I'm From Massachusetts\", and \"Massachusetts: The One And Only\" were popular for a short time in Massachusetts.\nNixon managed to win 18% of the African American vote (Gerald Ford would get 16% in 1976). He also remains the only Republican in modern times to threaten the oldest extant Democratic stronghold of &lt;a href=\"South%20Texas\"&gt;South Texas&lt;/a&gt;: this is the last election when the Republicans have won &lt;a href=\"Hidalgo%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Hidalgo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dimmit%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Dimmit&lt;/a&gt; counties, the only time Republicans have won &lt;a href=\"La%20Salle%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;La Salle County&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"William%20McKinley\"&gt;William McKinley&lt;/a&gt; in 1900 and &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, and one of only two occasions since Theodore Roosevelt in 1904 that Republicans have gained a majority in &lt;a href=\"Presidio%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Presidio County&lt;/a&gt;. More significantly, the 1972 election was the most recent time several highly populous urban counties \u2013 including &lt;a href=\"Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt; in Illinois, &lt;a href=\"Orleans%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;Orleans&lt;/a&gt; in Louisiana, &lt;a href=\"Hennepin%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Hennepin&lt;/a&gt; in Minnesota, &lt;a href=\"Cuyahoga%20County%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Cuyahoga&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio, &lt;a href=\"Durham%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Durham&lt;/a&gt; in North Carolina, &lt;a href=\"Queens%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; in New York, and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20George%27s%20County%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Prince George's&lt;/a&gt; in Maryland \u2013 have voted Republican.\nNixon, who became &lt;a href=\"term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;term-limited&lt;/a&gt; under the provisions of the &lt;a href=\"Twenty-second%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;Twenty-second Amendment&lt;/a&gt; as a result of his victory, became the first (and, as of 2020, only) presidential candidate to win a significant number of electoral votes in three presidential elections since ratification of that Amendment. Prior to ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment, three other presidential candidates (&lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Jackson\"&gt;Andrew Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grover%20Cleveland\"&gt;Grover Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;) also polled significant electoral votes in at least three elections (unlike Nixon, Jackson, Cleveland, and Roosevelt also won the popular vote at least three times, although only Roosevelt was elected President more than twice). Counting Nixon's successful runs for vice president in the 1950s, he matched Franklin Roosevelt's achievements of winning the presidency or vice-presidency in four elections (and polling significant electoral votes in five), while over-reaching Roosevelt by winning electoral votes for president or vice president in every state.\nResults by state.\nFor the first time since 1828 Maine allowed its electoral votes to be split between candidates. Two electoral votes were awarded to the winner of the statewide race and one electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district. This was the first time the Congressional District Method had been used since Michigan used it in 1892. Nixon won all four votes.\nClose states.\nStates where margin of victory was more than 5 percentage points, but less than 10 percentage points (43 electoral votes):\nTipping point states:\nStatistics.\nCounties with highest percentage of the vote (Republican)\nCounties with highest percentage of the vote (Democratic)\nCounties with highest percentage of the vote (Other)\nVoter demographics.\nNixon won 36 percent of the Democratic vote, according to an &lt;a href=\"exit%20poll\"&gt;exit poll&lt;/a&gt; conducted for &lt;a href=\"CBS%20News\"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt; by George Fine Research, Inc. This represents more than twice the percentage of voters who typically defect from their party in presidential elections. Nixon also became the first Republican presidential candidate in American history to win the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; vote (53\u201346), and the first in recent history to win the &lt;a href=\"blue-collar\"&gt;blue-collar&lt;/a&gt; vote, which he won by a 5-to-4 margin. McGovern narrowly won the union vote (50\u201348), though this difference was within the survey's margin of error of 2 percentage points. McGovern also narrowly won the youth vote (i. e., those aged 18 to 24) 52\u201346, a narrower margin than many of his strategists had predicted. Early on, the McGovern campaign also significantly over-estimated the number of young people who would vote in the election: They predicted that 18 million would have voted in total, but exit polls indicate that the actual number was about 12 million. McGovern did win comfortably among both &lt;a href=\"African-American\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; and Jewish voters, but by somewhat smaller margins than usual for a Democratic candidate.\nPost-election investigations into the Watergate break-in.\nOn June 17, 1972, five months before election day, five men broke into the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20National%20Committee\"&gt;Democratic National Committee&lt;/a&gt; headquarters at the &lt;a href=\"Watergate%20hotel\"&gt;Watergate hotel&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D. C.; the resulting investigation led to the revelation of attempted cover-ups of the break-in within the Nixon administration. What became known as the &lt;a href=\"Watergate%20scandal\"&gt;Watergate scandal&lt;/a&gt; eroded President Nixon's public and political support in his second term, and he resigned on August 9, 1974, in the face of probable &lt;a href=\"Impeachment%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;impeachment&lt;/a&gt; by the House of Representatives and removal from office by the Senate.\nAs part of the continuing Watergate investigation in 1974\u20131975, federal prosecutors offered companies that had given illegal campaign contributions to President Nixon's re-election campaign lenient sentences if they came forward. Many companies complied, including &lt;a href=\"Northrop%20Grumman\"&gt;Northrop Grumman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3M\"&gt;3M&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20Airlines\"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Braniff%20Airlines\"&gt;Braniff Airlines&lt;/a&gt;. By 1976, prosecutors had convicted 18 American corporations of contributing illegally to Nixon's campaign."
