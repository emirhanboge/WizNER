    "text": "Mary Bernard Aguirre (June 23, 1844 \u2013 May 24, 1906) was a public &lt;a href=\"schoolteacher\"&gt;schoolteacher&lt;/a&gt; and instructor at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Arizona\"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. \nEarly life.\nBernard Aguirre was born in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;St. Louis, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. She was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, Joab Bernard (1800\u20131879) and \nArabella Mather Bier Bernard (1816\u20131899). For the first twelve years of her life the family resided in &lt;a href=\"Baltimore\"&gt;Baltimore, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, the birthplace of Mary's mother. In 1856 the Bernard family moved to &lt;a href=\"Westport%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Westport, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, where Mary's father owned a large store.\nBernard Aguirre went to college at the age of seventeen; this would prove to be a critical period of her life, as she lived through many moments that eventually changed her views towards people of other races. She heard the &lt;a href=\"rifle\"&gt;rifle&lt;/a&gt; shot that killed &lt;a href=\"Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;abolitionist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29\"&gt;John Brown&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Harpers%20Ferry%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Harpers Ferry, West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Mary Bernard returned home from &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Baltimore, Maryland&lt;/a&gt; later that same year, the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; broke out, and she became a supporter of the Southern cause.\nPersonal life.\nMary Bernard married a &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Freight%20transport\"&gt;freighting&lt;/a&gt; contractor, &lt;a href=\"Epifanio%20Aguirre\"&gt;Epifanio Aguirre&lt;/a&gt;, on August 21, 1862 in &lt;a href=\"Westport%2C%20Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Westport&lt;/a&gt;. The Aguirres had three sons: Pedro, (born 1863), Epifanio Jr. (born 1865) and Stephen (born 1867).\nBernard Aguirre's family moved to the Southwest in 1863. They traveled from Missouri to &lt;a href=\"Las%20Cruces%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Las Cruces, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, with a stop in &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Santa Fe&lt;/a&gt;. Mary kept a journal of her family's travels across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Plains\"&gt;Great Plains&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 1869, the Aguirres set foot in &lt;a href=\"Tucson%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt;. In January 1870, Epifanio Sr. was killed during an &lt;a href=\"Apache\"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; raid of a &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Sasabe%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Sasabe, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. In economic straits, Bernard Aguirre saw herself forced to return home to Missouri and live with her parents.\nCareer.\nIn 1874, Mary Bernard Aguirre returned to Tucson, having accepted a job as a teacher in &lt;a href=\"Tres%20Alamos%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Tres Alamos&lt;/a&gt;. She taught in &lt;a href=\"Tucson%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt;-area public schools, including the &lt;a href=\"Tucson%20Public%20School%20for%20Girls\"&gt;Tucson Public School for Girls&lt;/a&gt;, for four years. During this time, Bernard Aguirre advocated for public education against the prevailing inclination among &lt;a href=\"Catholicism\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt; towards homeschooling.\nIn 1878, she became the first teacher in &lt;a href=\"Arivaca%2C%20Arizona\"&gt;Arivaca&lt;/a&gt;, sixty miles south of Tucson; during her tenure she was recruited to teach at the fledgling &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Arizona\"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe became chair of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish language&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"English%20history\"&gt;English history&lt;/a&gt; departments at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Arizona\"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; in 1885. She was the university's first female professor, and resigned from the post in 1901.\nIn 1906, Mary Bernard Aguirre was injured in a &lt;a href=\"sleeping%20car\"&gt;Pullman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; crash in &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. On May 24, 1906, two weeks after the accident, she died of internal injuries."
