    "text": "William Thomas Dartnell, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;VC&lt;/a&gt; (6 April 1885 \u2013 3 September 1915), also known as Wilbur Taylor Dartnell, was an Australian-born soldier, actor and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Australian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients\"&gt;a recipient&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt;, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; forces. Born in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, he served in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Second Boer War&lt;/a&gt; as a teenager and later in the &lt;a href=\"Bambatha%20Rebellion\"&gt;Bambatha Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; of 1906. He married, managed his own business and worked as a professional actor before immigrating to South Africa in 1912 or 1913.\nDartnell offered his services to the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, and was commissioned into the &lt;a href=\"25th%20%28Frontiersmen%29%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Fusiliers\"&gt;25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers&lt;/a&gt; in February 1915. He fought in the &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;East African Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and was &lt;a href=\"mentioned%20in%20dispatches\"&gt;mentioned in dispatches&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bukoba\"&gt;Battle of Bukoba&lt;/a&gt;, where he had stormed the German-held town hall, pulled down the German flag and replaced it with the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Jack\"&gt;Union Jack&lt;/a&gt;. On 3 September 1915, after his company had been ambushed and despite being wounded, Dartnell voluntarily stayed behind in an attempt to save the lives of wounded men as the remainder of the British force retired from the scene. Dartnell was killed in the attempt, but in recognition of his determination and sacrifice he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.\nEarly life.\nWilliam Thomas Dartnell was born in the &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; suburb of &lt;a href=\"Collingwood%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Collingwood&lt;/a&gt; on 6 April 1885 to Henry Dartnell, an English-born &lt;a href=\"fruiterer\"&gt;fruiterer&lt;/a&gt;, and his Australian wife Rose Ann (n\u00e9e Hanley). He was brought up in Melbourne and, after leaving school, became an actor. In 1900, at the age of 15, Dartnell joined the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Mounted%20Rifles\"&gt;Victorian Mounted Rifles&lt;/a&gt;, a part-time &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20forces%20of%20Australia%23Victoria\"&gt;colonial militia unit&lt;/a&gt;. The regiment was mobilised as the 5th Victorian (Mounted Rifles) Contingent in early 1901 for service in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Second Boer War&lt;/a&gt;, and embarked for South Africa on 15 February. Arriving in &lt;a href=\"Port%20Elizabeth\"&gt;Port Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; the following month, Dartnell saw service in the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Colony\"&gt;Cape Colony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Free%20State\"&gt;Orange Free State&lt;/a&gt; over the next twelve months and was wounded on 6 April\u2014his 16th birthday. The Mounted Rifles returned to Australia in March 1902, and Dartnell was demobilised soon thereafter. He later returned to South Africa, and served as part of &lt;a href=\"John%20Royston\"&gt;Royston's&lt;/a&gt; Horse during the &lt;a href=\"Bambatha%20Rebellion\"&gt;Bambatha Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Colony%20of%20Natal\"&gt;Natal&lt;/a&gt; in 1906. For his service in these two campaigns Dartnell was issued the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20South%20Africa%20Medal\"&gt;Queen's South Africa Medal&lt;/a&gt; with \"Cape Colony\" and \"Orange Free State\" clasps, the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20South%20Africa%20Medal\"&gt;King's South Africa Medal&lt;/a&gt; with the clasps \"South Africa 1901\" and \"South Africa 1902\", and the &lt;a href=\"Natal%20Native%20Rebellion%20Medal\"&gt;Natal Native Rebellion Medal&lt;/a&gt; with \"1906\" clasp.\nAfter he returned to Australia, Dartnell married Elizabeth Edith Smyth on 15 April 1907 at Holt's Matrimonial Agency on &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Street%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Queen Street, Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. They settled in &lt;a href=\"Fitzroy%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Fitzroy&lt;/a&gt;, and had a daughter in 1908. Little is known about Dartnell's life over the next few years, though it is thought that he managed his own business and worked as an actor until 1912 or 1913, when he again departed for South Africa. Elizabeth and their daughter remained in &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, while Dartnell established himself in &lt;a href=\"East%20London%2C%20Eastern%20Cape\"&gt;East London&lt;/a&gt;, a coastal city in the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Province\"&gt;Cape Province&lt;/a&gt;. He found employment with the Standard Printing Company, and was a regular contributor to their Saturday newspaper, the \"Weekly Standard\". During this period, he started using the name Wilbur Taylor Dartnell and, according to historian Gerald Gliddon, became engaged to another woman, a Mabel Evans.\nFirst World War.\nAfter the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, Dartnell organised and chaired a meeting of Australians in East London who were willing to serve the British Empire. He cabled the War Office with a list of interested names (including his own), offered their services and requested passage to England in order to enlist. The request was evidently approved, as the group embarked for Britain in late September 1914. Using his assumed name, Dartnell joined the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20of%20Frontiersmen\"&gt;Legion of Frontiersmen&lt;/a&gt; and was subsequently commissioned as a temporary &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"25th%20%28Frontiersmen%29%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Fusiliers\"&gt;25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers&lt;/a&gt; on 12 February 1915. As the \"Frontiersmen\" designation may suggest, the 25th Battalion \"included men of various ages and with strange experience from all quarters of the globe\", according to the regimental history. The battalion had been specifically raised to operate from &lt;a href=\"British%20East%20Africa\"&gt;British East Africa&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"German%20East%20Africa\"&gt;Germany's neighbouring colonial possessions&lt;/a&gt;, and was reputedly the only British unit \"sent on active service during the war without preliminary training\". The 25th embarked from &lt;a href=\"Plymouth\"&gt;Plymouth&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Mombasa\"&gt;Mombasa&lt;/a&gt; on 10 April, less than two months after it had been raised. Dartnell had spent the intervening time stationed in &lt;a href=\"Swaythling\"&gt;Swaythling&lt;/a&gt;, and had made a number of trips to Belgium ferrying drafts of artillery horses to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 25th Battalion arrived in Mombasa on 4 May, and was immediately dispatched to &lt;a href=\"Kajiado\"&gt;Kajiado&lt;/a&gt; to defend the local section of the &lt;a href=\"Uganda%20Railway\"&gt;Uganda Railway&lt;/a&gt; from German raiding parties. Being a strategic rail line, it had been subject to frequent &lt;a href=\"Guerrilla%20warfare\"&gt;guerrilla-style&lt;/a&gt; attacks since the declaration of war. In June, Dartnell took part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bukoba\"&gt;attack on the German fort and wireless station&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Bukoba\"&gt;Bukoba&lt;/a&gt;; the base for German raids on the Ugandan frontier. The assault party, numbering approximately 400, had had to sail across &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Victoria\"&gt;Lake Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and scale a \"cliff-like incline\" before they reached the outskirts of Bukoba to commence their attack on 21 June. The British and German forces wrested for control of the town for two days before the raiding party was able to seize the wireless station and town hall. In the final assault, Dartnell had been the first to enter the German-held town hall, and had hauled down the German flag to replace it with the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Jack\"&gt;Union Jack&lt;/a&gt;. Dartnell's actions were later recognised with a &lt;a href=\"mention%20in%20despatches\"&gt;mention in despatches&lt;/a&gt;. He was also reportedly recommended for the &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Service%20Order\"&gt;Distinguished Service Order&lt;/a&gt; for his performance in the battle, but this was not awarded. He was, however, promoted to temporary &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; on 25 July.\nVictoria Cross.\nShortly after the victory at Bukoba, the 25th Battalion moved to &lt;a href=\"Voi\"&gt;Voi&lt;/a&gt; where a military railway was being constructed for an allied advance into &lt;a href=\"German%20East%20Africa\"&gt;German East Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The battalion was employed in protection duties during this time, while two &lt;a href=\"mounted%20infantry\"&gt;mounted infantry&lt;/a&gt; companies were formed in August by drawing upon the unit and the 2nd Battalion, &lt;a href=\"Loyal%20Regiment%20%28North%20Lancashire%29\"&gt;Loyal North Lancashire Regiment&lt;/a&gt; to patrol the frontier around &lt;a href=\"Maktau\"&gt;Maktau&lt;/a&gt;, to Voi's east. Dartnell was assigned the command of a &lt;a href=\"Section%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; within one of the companies.\nOn 3 September, word came through that a German raiding party was in the vicinity of Maktau. A counter force of 117 men was raised from Dartnell's company with Captain John Woodruffe in command, and sent to intercept the German troops. The British force, however, was ambushed by a German party approximately 200 strong, which included a number of native &lt;a href=\"Askari\"&gt;Askari&lt;/a&gt; soldiers. Casualties were high, and the situation soon descended into chaos. Woodruffe, by this time badly wounded and concerned that his men were becoming surrounded, ordered that the wounded be quickly withdrawn so that the remainder of the force could retire. However, given the intensity of the firefight and the limited resources available, the grievously wounded could not be moved. Dartnell had been wounded in the leg and was being carried away to safety when he realised the situation. Fearing what the Askari would do to the British wounded, he demanded to remain and fight. Though twice instructed to leave, Dartnell refused and gave the order for his men to abandon him. Dartnell was last seen firing on the German troops, who were within of his position. When his body was recovered several hours later, it was surrounded by seven dead German soldiers.\nLegacy.\nDartnell's determination and sacrifice during his last battle was posthumously recognised with the award of the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Cross\"&gt;Victoria Cross&lt;/a&gt; (VC). The announcement and accompanying citation for the medal was published in a supplement to the \"&lt;a href=\"London%20Gazette\"&gt;London Gazette&lt;/a&gt;\" on 23 December 1915, reading:\nDartnell was one of four personnel to receive the VC in the &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;East African Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. He and seven of the other British troops killed in the ambush were initially buried at Maktau Military Cemetery, but were later reinterred in the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission\"&gt;Commonwealth War Grave Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; at Voi. His military effects were sold off in October and the proceeds sent to his fianc\u00e9e Mabel, whom Dartnell had named in his will. But the funds were later claimed by his widow. Elizabeth Dartnell received her husband's VC from &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Munro%20Ferguson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Novar\"&gt;Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Governor-General%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Governor-General of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, in a private ceremony at &lt;a href=\"Government%20House%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Government House, Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; on 7 October 1916. &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Stanley%2C%205th%20Baron%20Stanley%20of%20Alderley\"&gt;Sir Arthur Stanley&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Victoria\"&gt;Governor of Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Barton\"&gt;Sir Edmund Barton&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Judge\"&gt;justice&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20of%20Australia\"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt; and a former &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Prime Minister of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, were also in attendance. Elizabeth, who was living with her daughter in the Melbourne suburb of &lt;a href=\"Murrumbeena%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Murrumbeena&lt;/a&gt; at the time, later named her house \"Maktau\" after the place of her husband's actions and death, and was later invited to the VC centenary celebrations in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; in 1956.\nDartnell's status as a professional actor was not forgotten. Several newspaper reports after his death postulated whether his VC was the first awarded to an actor, and he is commemorated on a plaque in the &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane\"&gt;Theatre Royal, Drury Lane&lt;/a&gt;. Dartnell Street in &lt;a href=\"Canberra\"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; is also named for him, while the German flag he captured at Bukoba is in the collection of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Fusiliers\"&gt;Royal Fusiliers&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in London. In 1981 Dartnell's VC and other medals were sold at a &lt;a href=\"Sotheby%27s\"&gt;Sotheby's&lt;/a&gt; auction to &lt;a href=\"Spink%20%26amp%3B%20Son\"&gt;Spink &amp; Son&lt;/a&gt; for 24,000. The auction house held the medals for little more than two years before auctioning them off again in 1983 for A$36,000. The buyer donated the set to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20War%20Memorial\"&gt;Australian War Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, where they are displayed in the Hall of Valour."
