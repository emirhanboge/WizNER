Neelakanda Iyer, and &lt;a href=\"Kurur%20Neelakandan%20Namboodiripad\"&gt;Kurur Neelakandan Namboodiripad&lt;/a&gt; were the key people in the formation of the party. Eminent politicians like &lt;a href=\"Panampilly%20Govinda%20Menon\"&gt;Panampilly Govinda Menon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K.%20Karunakaran\"&gt;K. Karunakaran&lt;/a&gt; worked in the party.\nHistory.\nA group of young people who were displeased with the functioning of political movements in the erstwhile &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Cochin\"&gt;Kochi state&lt;/a&gt;, at the meeting held on 26 January 1941 under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"V.%20R.%20Krishnan%20Ezhuthachan\"&gt;V.

Neelakanda Iyer as President and Ezhuthachan as general secretary. The primary objective of party was to end political &lt;a href=\"sovereignty\"&gt;sovereignty&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Cochin\"&gt;King of Cochin&lt;/a&gt; and gain equality and political power for the people. The party also worked to spread the use of &lt;a href=\"khadi\"&gt;khadi&lt;/a&gt;, prohibit &lt;a href=\"liquor\"&gt;liquor&lt;/a&gt;, and gain progress in the field of &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20India\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrajamandalam's work to save people from calamity during the flood of 1941 gained acceptance for the party. The party formed a flood relief committee during that time.\nPrajamandalam formed an organisation called which worked primarily to end the difficulties farmers faced due to &lt;a href=\"feudalism\"&gt;feudalism&lt;/a&gt;. stood for permanent ownership for farmers in their field. Their protests caused acceptance of the bill on 13 February 1943 at the &lt;a href=\"Cochin%20Legislative%20Council\"&gt;Cochin Legislative Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrajamandalam decided to conduct its first annual meeting in 1942 at &lt;a href=\"Irinjalakkuda\"&gt;Irinjalakkuda&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Dewan\"&gt;diwan&lt;/a&gt; of Cochin, A. F. W. Dixon, banned it. However, some leaders came forward to conduct the meeting. Many leaders including &lt;a href=\"K.%20Karunakaran\"&gt;Karunakaran&lt;/a&gt; were arrested and faced brutal torture in jail.\nIn connection with the &lt;a href=\"Quit%20India%20movement\"&gt;Quit India movement&lt;/a&gt; on 5 August 1942, a conference was conducted under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Gandhiji\"&gt;Gandhiji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nehru\"&gt;Nehru&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"All%20India%20Congress%20Committee\"&gt;All India Congress Committee&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Bombay\"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt;. Iyer and Ezhuthachan attended the conference by representing Prajamandalam. As part of the Quit India movement, Prajamandalam actively participated in &lt;a href=\"strike%20action\"&gt;strikes&lt;/a&gt;. During that time there was strong ban in functioning of the press, Prajamandalam started a newspaper called \"&lt;a href=\"Deenabandhu\"&gt;Deenabandhu&lt;/a&gt;.\" The newspaper helped to strengthen freedom movements.\nIn 1945 Prajamandalam faced election and gained a majority in the Cochin Legislative Council. Prajamandalam chose opposition and worked for responsible government. The party also worked for the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Entry%20Proclamation\"&gt;Temple Entry movement&lt;/a&gt; also.\nPrajamandalam is one of the first political parties which dispersed after completion of its objective. Later Prajamandalam merged with &lt;a href=\"Indian%20national%20congress\"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt;."
