    "text": "This article contains detailed information on &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;Malaysia Super League&lt;/a&gt;, which begins with the 2004 season until current season.\n2004.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;Malaysia Super League&lt;/a&gt; (MSL) was introduced for the first time in 2004. It replaced the &lt;a href=\"M-League\"&gt;M-League&lt;/a&gt; as the top-most tier for professional Malaysian football clubs.\nThe season kicked off on February 14, 2004. &lt;a href=\"Pahang%20FA\"&gt;Pahang FA&lt;/a&gt; dominated the season and ended up winning the title by a wide margin and this was down to their efforts in securing the services of the nation's top players prior to the start of the new season. &lt;a href=\"Pahang%20FA\"&gt;Pahang FA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Indra%20Putra%20Mahayuddin\"&gt;Indra Putra Mahayuddin&lt;/a&gt; was the season's top goalscorer with 15 goals. He remains, until this day, the last &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;n to win that accolade.\nThe highest scoring match of the season was &lt;a href=\"Perlis%20FA\"&gt;Perlis FA&lt;/a&gt; 6-2 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Kedah%20FA\"&gt;Kedah FA&lt;/a&gt; on July 31, 2004.\nA plus point was the surprisingly strong finish of club side &lt;a href=\"Public%20Bank%20FC\"&gt;Public Bank FC&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Malaysia\"&gt;Football Association of Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; were trying to promote clubs as the future of Malaysian football.\n2005.\nThe 2005 season of the &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;Malaysia Super League&lt;/a&gt; was the second since its inception in 2004. It kicked off on January 29, 2005.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Pahang%20FA\"&gt;Pahang FA&lt;/a&gt; before them, &lt;a href=\"Perlis%20FA\"&gt;Perlis FA&lt;/a&gt; won the title easily, leaving the defending champions a huge 10 points behind. &lt;a href=\"Penang%20FA%20%28Penang%20E%20%26amp%3B%20O%29\"&gt;Penang FA (Penang E &amp; O)&lt;/a&gt; escaped relegation on goal difference, having let in 4 goals less than &lt;a href=\"Public%20Bank%20FC\"&gt;Public Bank FC&lt;/a&gt;. The best club side was &lt;a href=\"Selangor%20MPPJ\"&gt;Selangor MPPJ&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe top goalscorer award was jointly won by &lt;a href=\"Perlis%20FA\"&gt;Perlis FA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Zacharia%20Simukonda\"&gt;Zacharia Simukonda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sabah%20F.C.%20%28Malaysia%29\"&gt;Sabah FA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BAlio%20C%C3%A9sar%20Rodrigues%20de%20Souza\"&gt;J\u00falio C\u00e9sar Rodrigues de Souza&lt;/a&gt;. Both scored 18 goals. The highest number of goals featured in a match throughout the season was six. Four matches ended with six goals.\nThe end of the season was marred by turmoil after &lt;a href=\"Public%20Bank%20FC\"&gt;Public Bank FC&lt;/a&gt; announced it would pulled out from the League, having been relegated. The team was eventually banned from all FAM competitions.\n2005\u201306.\nThe 2005\u201306 season of the &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;Malaysia Super League&lt;/a&gt; was the third since its inception. It kicked off on December 3, 2005. &lt;a href=\"Negeri%20Sembilan%20FA\"&gt;Negeri Sembilan FA&lt;/a&gt; emerged champions with one match to spare. They garnered 40 points from 21 matches and won the title despite scoring less goals than all the other teams in the league except &lt;a href=\"Pahang%20FA\"&gt;Pahang FA&lt;/a&gt;, who finished second from bottom. With this title, they finally erased the painful memory of losing the 1996 &lt;a href=\"M-League\"&gt;M-League&lt;/a&gt; crown having topped the table for most of that season.\nTheir nearest rivals were &lt;a href=\"Melaka%20TMFC\"&gt;Melaka TMFC&lt;/a&gt; with 33 points. Having been in the title contention for most parts of the season, they were the best positioned club side in MSL history after &lt;a href=\"Public%20Bank%20FC\"&gt;Public Bank FC&lt;/a&gt; in 2004.\n&lt;a href=\"Perak%20FA\"&gt;Perak FA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Keita%20Mandjou\"&gt;Keita Mandjou&lt;/a&gt; was the season's top scorer with 17 goals. Three matches, including &lt;a href=\"Selangor%20FA\"&gt;Selangor FA&lt;/a&gt;'s 6-1 hammering at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Perlis%20FA\"&gt;Perlis FA&lt;/a&gt;, featured seven goals, and these were the season's highest scoring matches.\nRelegation playoffs.\nAs a result of the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Malaysia\"&gt;Football Association of Malaysia's&lt;/a&gt; decision to expand the league to 14 teams, the relegation playoffs were held on June 18, 2006. Six of the league's 14 places were up for grabs in this competition.\n&lt;a href=\"Pahang%20FA\"&gt;Pahang FA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Selangor%20FA\"&gt;Selangor FA&lt;/a&gt; qualified for this competition by virtue of being the lowest placed &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt; teams. Top teams from the &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Malaysia Premier League&lt;/a&gt; also qualified for this competition (except for &lt;a href=\"Kedah%20FA\"&gt;Kedah FA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malacca%20FA\"&gt;Malacca FA&lt;/a&gt;, who were automatically promoted by virtue of being Premier League Champions).\nThe first round of matches saw &lt;a href=\"Sarawak%20FA\"&gt;Sarawak FA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terengganu%20FA\"&gt;Terengganu FA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Selangor%20FA\"&gt;Selangor FA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DPMM%20FC%20%28Duli%20Pengiran%20Muda%20Mahkota%20FC%29\"&gt;DPMM FC (Duli Pengiran Muda Mahkota FC)&lt;/a&gt; promoted.\nThe second round of matches saw &lt;a href=\"Johor%20FC\"&gt;Johor FC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pahang%20FA\"&gt;Pahang FA&lt;/a&gt; promoted.\n2006\u201307.\nThe 2006\u201307 season of the &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;Malaysia Super League&lt;/a&gt; is the fourth edition of the competition since its inception. It kicked off on December 16, 2006.\nThe 2007 season is also the first season played with 13 teams (previous versions had only eight). The &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Malaysia\"&gt;FAM&lt;/a&gt; had originally planned for a 14-team league, but this was ruined with the failure of &lt;a href=\"Selangor%20MPPJ\"&gt;Selangor MPPJ&lt;/a&gt;'s failure to register at the start of the season.\n&lt;a href=\"Perak%20FA\"&gt;Perak FA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Keita%20Mandjou\"&gt;Keita Mandjou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DPMM%20FC%20%28Duli%20Pengiran%20Muda%20Mahkota%20FC%29\"&gt;DPMM FC (Duli Pengiran Muda Mahkota FC)&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Brunei\"&gt;Brunei&lt;/a&gt;)'s Mohd Shahrazen Said was the season's top scorer with 21 goals each.\nLeague table.\n\"Note\": &lt;a href=\"Malacca%20FA\"&gt;Malacca FA&lt;/a&gt;'s relegation to &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Malaysia%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2007\u201308 Malaysia Premier League&lt;/a&gt; season had been revoked because &lt;a href=\"Melaka%20TMFC\"&gt;Melaka TMFC&lt;/a&gt; pulled out from the &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;Malaysia Super League&lt;/a&gt;.\n2007\u201308.\nThe 2007\u201308 season of the &lt;a href=\"Malaysia%20Super%20League\"&gt;Malaysia Super League&lt;/a&gt; is the 5th edition since its inception.
