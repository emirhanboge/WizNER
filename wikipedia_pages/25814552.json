    "text": "Arthur Hughes Milne (11 December 1914 \u2013 22 May 1997) was a Scottish &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player, who was a prolific goalscorer for &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee United&lt;/a&gt; and also played in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish Football League&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Brechin\"&gt;Brechin&lt;/a&gt; in 1915, Milne played for local club &lt;a href=\"Brechin%20Victoria%20F.C.\"&gt;Brechin Vics&lt;/a&gt;, until signing for &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;United&lt;/a&gt; in 1934. Remarkably, he scored four goals on his senior debut, which no other player in the club's history has done. Milne continued his prolific rate of scoring, netting 85 goals in 81 appearances for United. No other player in the club's history has achieved a ratio better than one goal per game.\nMilne had a pay dispute with United in 1937, which led to him going on trial with &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;. This trial, however, created a registration mix-up which led to Milne being declared a &lt;a href=\"free%20agent\"&gt;free agent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of the opportunity to sign Milne for no fee. Milne also scored goals at a good rate for Hibs, finishing as their top scorer in the next two seasons. His career, however, was interrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, which curtailed competitive football in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe outbreak of war meant that players were allowed to play for other clubs with their team's permission. It was under these circumstances that in November 1939 Milne returned to play for Dundee United who had joined the &lt;a href=\"1939%E2%80%9340%20in%20Scottish%20football%23Eastern%20division\"&gt;Eastern Division&lt;/a&gt; of the recently set up emergency league. United were also competing in the hastily set up &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20War%20Emergency%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish War Emergency Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Milne showed flashes of the form he had shown in his previous spell at Tannadice, as United reached the cup final; he scored a hat-trick in the second round of the competition in a 7-1 win over &lt;a href=\"Third%20Lanark%20A.C.\"&gt;Third Lanark&lt;/a&gt; and was in the starting line-up in the final which his side narrowly lost to &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;. Milne was United's top scorer for &lt;a href=\"1939%E2%80%9340%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;the season&lt;/a&gt; with 24 goals. Shortly afterwards he was called up for military service. During the war he appeared for &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%20F.C.\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt; in unofficial competitions.\nWhen league football resumed in 1946, Milne's career was nearing its end. He only played in three league matches, scoring one goal, for Hibs after the war before being sold to &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"British%20pound%20sterling\"&gt;\u00a3&lt;/a&gt;1650. Milne played for the &lt;a href=\"Paisley%2C%20Renfrewshire\"&gt;Paisley&lt;/a&gt; club for four seasons, before moving to Northern Ireland in the summer of 1950 to become a player/coach of &lt;a href=\"Coleraine%20F.C.\"&gt;Coleraine&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilne represented &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; once, in a &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team%20results%20%28unofficial%20matches%29%23World%20War%20II\"&gt;wartime international&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; on 14 October 1944; Milne scored one of the Scottish goals in a 6\u20132 defeat."
