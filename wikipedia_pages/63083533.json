    "text": "Northumbria is a traditional area of England. It corresponds to or includes the &lt;a href=\"historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;historic county&lt;/a&gt; areas of &lt;a href=\"Northumberland\"&gt;Northumberland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"county%20palatine%20of%20Durham\"&gt;Durham&lt;/a&gt; but may also be taken to be synonymous with &lt;a href=\"North%20East%20England\"&gt;North East England&lt;/a&gt;. A representative provincial flag of Northumbria is registered for the area.\nDefinition.\nPrecise definitions vary but typically centre around the historic counties of Northumberland and Durham; the ceremonial counties of Northumberland, &lt;a href=\"County%20Durham\"&gt;Durham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyne%20and%20Wear\"&gt;Tyne and Wear&lt;/a&gt;; or the &lt;a href=\"North%20East%20England\"&gt;North East England&lt;/a&gt; region. Parts of historic &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; and ceremonial &lt;a href=\"North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;North Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; are however included in these areas, respectfully. It is in the title of several institutions:\nHistorical background.\nRoman.\n&lt;a href=\"Hadrian%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Hadrian's Wall&lt;/a&gt; was one of the frontiers of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Roman archaeology can be found widely across the region and a special exhibition based around the Roman Fort of Segedunum at Wallsend and the other forts along Hadrian's Wall are complemented by the numerous artifacts that are displayed in the Great North Museum Hancock in Newcastle. &lt;a href=\"St%20Peter%27s%20Church%2C%20Monkwearmouth\"&gt;St. Peter's Church&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Monkwearmouth\"&gt;Monkwearmouth&lt;/a&gt;, Sunderland and St. Pauls in &lt;a href=\"Jarrow\"&gt;Jarrow&lt;/a&gt; also hold significant historical value and have a joint bid to become a World Heritage Site.\nAngles.\nThe area has a strong religious past, as can be seen in works such as the &lt;a href=\"Lindisfarne%20Gospels\"&gt;Lindisfarne Gospels&lt;/a&gt; and the \"&lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\". The works of &lt;a href=\"Cuthbert\"&gt;Cuthbert&lt;/a&gt; (634\u2013687 AD), &lt;a href=\"Bede\"&gt;Bede&lt;/a&gt; (673\u2013735 AD) and &lt;a href=\"Hilda%20of%20Whitby\"&gt;Hilda of Whitby&lt;/a&gt; (614\u2013680 AD) were hugely influential in the early church, and are still venerated by some today. These saints are usually associated with the monasteries on the island of &lt;a href=\"Lindisfarne\"&gt;Lindisfarne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wearmouth-Jarrow\"&gt;Wearmouth-Jarrow&lt;/a&gt;, and the Abbey at &lt;a href=\"Whitby\"&gt;Whitby&lt;/a&gt;, though they are also associated with many other religious sites in the region. Bede is regarded as the greatest Anglo-Saxon scholar. He worked at the monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow, translating some forty books on all areas of knowledge, including nature, history, astronomy, poetry and theological matters such as the lives of the saints. His best known work is \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People\"&gt;The Ecclesiastical History of the English People&lt;/a&gt;\". One of the most famous pieces of art and literature created in the region is the \"&lt;a href=\"Lindisfarne%20Gospels\"&gt;Lindisfarne Gospels&lt;/a&gt;\", thought to be the work of a monk named Eadfrith, who became Bishop of Lindisfarne in 698. This body of work is thought to have been created in honour of Cuthbert, around 710\u2013720.\nAt its greatest extent, the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria extended from the Scottish borders (then &lt;a href=\"Pictish\"&gt;Pictish&lt;/a&gt; borders) at the Firth of Forth to the north, and to the south of &lt;a href=\"York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;, its capital, down to the Humber and Mersey. On 6 June 793 the Vikings arrived on the shores of north-east England with a raiding party from Norway who attacked the monastic settlement on Lindisfarne. The monks fled or were slaughtered, and Bishop Higbald sought refuge on the mainland. A chronicler recorded: \"On the 8th June, the harrying of the heathen miserably destroyed God's church by rapine and slaughter.\" There were three hundred years of Viking raids, battles and settlement until &lt;a href=\"William%20the%20Conqueror\"&gt;William the Conqueror&lt;/a&gt; defeated King Harold at Hastings in 1066.\nIn 866 Ivar the Boneless captured York and reduced the Northumbrian kingdom to just Bernicia (Durham, Northumberland, and Lothian). The lands north of the Tees were outside the immediate control of the Scandinavian Kings of York and remained under Anglian control, ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Bamburgh\"&gt;Earls of Bamburgh&lt;/a&gt; (or Earls of Northumbria) with the Community of St Cuthbert ruling the valley of the Wear and lands south of the Tyne. Both Bamburgh and Community of St. Cuthbert presented themselves as the successors of the Kingdom of Northumbria. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" notes the change from raiding to settlement when it records that in 876 the Vikings \"Shared out the land of the Northumbrians and they proceeded to plough and support themselves\" However, Scandinavian settlement was concentrated south of the Tees and penetrated only a short distance north thereof, terminating beyond &lt;a href=\"Teesdale\"&gt;Teesdale&lt;/a&gt;. This is attested by place-name evidence, which suggests that County Durham and Northumberland were not settled by Scandinavians to the extent that Yorkshire and other parts of Northern England were.\nIn 954 the West Saxon Kings conquered the Kingdom of York, eventually integrating it as a shire within the new English kingdom. The administrative system of shires and hundreds did not extent beyond the Tees with the lands north thereof being left under the control of its native rulers: the Earls of Bamburgh and Community of St Cuthbert.The Scottish victory at the Battle of Carham in 1018, after which Lothian was annexed by the Kingdom of Scotland, set Northumbria\u2019s northern frontier on the Tweed rather than the Forth.By the end of the Anglo-Saxon era, the term 'Northumbria' had become restricted in reference to the region between the Tweed and Tees. In the Chronical of 1065 \"Nor\u00f0hymbralande\" ('Northumberland' or 'Northumbria') was already contrasted with Eoforwicscire ('Yorkshire'). Henry of Huntingdon described northern England as consisting of three counties: the Bishopric of Carlisle, Yorkshire and Northumberland (\"over which the Bishop of Durham presides\").\nNormans.\nThe County of Northumberland or \"Comitatus Northumbriae\" was formed from the rump of Northumbria following the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Conquest\"&gt;Norman conquest of England&lt;/a&gt;, a single royal county encompassing all of north-eastern England between the Tweed and Tees. The county included several 'royal liberties' where the king's writ did not run, including &lt;a href=\"Hexhamshire\"&gt;Hexhamshire&lt;/a&gt;, which was ruled by the Archbishops of York; and &lt;a href=\"Tynedale\"&gt;Tynedale&lt;/a&gt;, which was ruled by the Kings of Scotland for much of the 13th century. The largest and most important liberty was that of the Liberty of Durham, which retained a high degree of autonomy under the &lt;a href=\"Bishops%20of%20Durham\"&gt;Bishops of Durham&lt;/a&gt; and lacked representation in the lower parliament. Originally, large swathes of land on north bank of the Tees lay outside of the liberty and formed the &lt;a href=\"Sadberge%20%28wapentake%29\"&gt;Wapentake of Sadberge&lt;/a&gt;, which consisted of a collection of exclaves ruled directly by the Earls of Northumberland. Sadberge was purchased by bishop &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20de%20Puiset\"&gt;Hugh de Puiset&lt;/a&gt; in 1189 and gradually incorporated into the County Palatine; it retained separate &lt;a href=\"assizes\"&gt;assizes&lt;/a&gt; until 1586.\nThe crown regarded Durham as part of Northumberland until the late 13th century. In 1293 the Bishop of Durham and his steward failed to attend proceedings of &lt;a href=\"quo%20warranto\"&gt;quo warranto&lt;/a&gt; held by the justices of Northumberland. The bishop's case was heard in &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20England\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, where he stated that Durham lay outside the bounds of any English shire. The arguments appear to have been accepted, as by the fourteenth century Durham was accepted as a liberty which received royal mandates direct. In effect it was a private shire, with the bishop appointing his own &lt;a href=\"sheriff\"&gt;sheriff&lt;/a&gt;. The area thus became known as the \"&lt;a href=\"County%20Palatine\"&gt;County Palatine&lt;/a&gt; of Durham\". Hexhamshire, which had been transferred to the See of York by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20I\"&gt;Henry I&lt;/a&gt;, was first referred to as a separate separate County Palatinate in the 14th century. However, in 1572 it was reintegrated into Northumberland proper. From thereon, the region would be permanently divided into two separate counties: the County of Northumberland and County Palatine of Durham.\nVictorian era.\nNorthumbria, in the modern sense, emerged as a concept in the 19th century. During the second half of the 19th century a cultural movement appeared among the north-eastern intelligentsia who sought to identify the region as a distinct historic nation. The old kingdom of Northumbria was its underlying inspiration, albeit with medieval and early modern histories woven in as well, and the historic counties of Northumberland and Durham were its homeland. In 1834 the &lt;a href=\"Surtees%20Society\"&gt;Surtees Society&lt;/a&gt; was established with focus on publishing 'manuscripts illustrative of the history of the ancient kingdom of Northumbria, principally of County Durham and Northumberland'. The influence of Northumbrian romantic regionalism is most apparent in the development of a distinctly 'Northumbrian' musical identity, differentiated from English folk music as a whole, and compounded in publications such as the &lt;a href=\"Northumbrian%20Minstrelsy\"&gt;Northumbrian Minstrelsy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhymes%20of%20Northern%20Bards\"&gt;Rhymes of Northern Bards&lt;/a&gt; by drawing upon earlier works from both Northumberland and County Durham. In some sense, the movement paralleled the Irish, Scottish, and Welsh home ruler movements of the time, but unlike the former, did not cross the boundary from unionism to separatism and ultimately remained a cultural movement. Today, the term has been re-established as a legitimate moniker for the region, however, is not the official name for the &lt;a href=\"North%20East%20England\"&gt;UK region of North East England&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nNorthumbrian culture has aspects in common with the cultures of both &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, but also includes many unique traditions. Northumbria is known for its distinctive musical culture and has its own unique instrument, the &lt;a href=\"Northumbrian%20smallpipe\"&gt;Northumbrian smallpipe&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthumbria has &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Northumbrian%20saints\"&gt;its own tradition of Christian saints&lt;/a&gt; that have given rise to localised dedications. &lt;a href=\"Cuthbert\"&gt;St. Cuthbert&lt;/a&gt; is of particular significance; annual St. Cuthbert's day celebrations are held each year by the Northumbrian Association and marked by a walk from &lt;a href=\"Chester-le-Street\"&gt;Chester-le-Street&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Durham%2C%20England\"&gt;Durham&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a procession through Durham city.\nMusic.\nNorthumbria possesses a distinctive style of folk music characterised by &lt;a href=\"border%20ballad\"&gt;border ballad&lt;/a&gt;ry, use of the &lt;a href=\"Northumbrian%20smallpipes\"&gt;Northumbrian smallpipes&lt;/a&gt; and strong &lt;a href=\"fiddle\"&gt;fiddle&lt;/a&gt; tradition that was already well-established in the 1690s.\nBlaydon Races.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blaydon%20Races\"&gt;Blaydon Races&lt;/a&gt;, a popular musical hall song first sung by Geordie Ridley at Balmbra's Music Hall in Newcastle in 1862, gives an idea of some of the characters attending the old meetings. These races were held on an island in the middle of the Tyne and were last held on 2 September 1916. A riot broke out after the winning horse was disqualified, and the event was discontinued. It is remembered in the famous English folk song The Blaydon Races, and the event and its characters are vividly depicted in William Irving's 1903 painting. 'The Blaydon Races \u2013 A Study from Life' which is on show at the &lt;a href=\"Shipley%20Art%20Gallery\"&gt;Shipley Art Gallery&lt;/a&gt; in Gateshead.\nFolklore.\n\"Worms\" (derived from &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Norse&lt;/a&gt;: \u2018ormr\") are a common aspect of Northumbrian folklore, notable examples from the region include the &lt;a href=\"Lambton%20Worm\"&gt;Lambton Worm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sockburn%20Worm\"&gt;Sockburn Worm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Laidly%20Worm%20of%20Spindleston%20Heugh\"&gt;Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, a Northumbrian worm legend focuses upon a knight who returns home from a foreign war to defeat one of these creatures.\nPolitics.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Independence%20Party\"&gt;Northern Independence Party&lt;/a&gt; (NIP) is a &lt;a href=\"secessionist\"&gt;secessionist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;political party&lt;/a&gt; which seeks to make &lt;a href=\"Northern%20England\"&gt;Northern England&lt;/a&gt; an independent state under the name Northumbria. This proposed state would encompass the entirety of Northern England based upon the full extent of the Kingdom of Northumbria and not only the modern region.\nHistorical and genetic origins.\nNorthumberland and County Durham, together with the Scottish Borders, are conterminous with the ancient British tribal kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Bernicia\"&gt;Bernicia&lt;/a&gt; (Bryneich) which is notable for the stable ancestry of its present indigenous population. The people of the region have been identified by DNA analysis to be strongly related to the genetic clusters of the Scottish Lowlands, Cumbria and Northern Ireland, who share a common line of descent.\nLinguistically, the &lt;a href=\"Northumbrian%20dialect\"&gt;Northumbrian dialect&lt;/a&gt; is closely related to Scots and other traditional Northern English dialects which share a common origin in Northumbrian Middle English.\nBiodiversity.\nThe region has a diverse landscape that includes maritime cliffs and extensive &lt;a href=\"moorland\"&gt;moorland&lt;/a&gt; that contains a number of &lt;a href=\"rare%20species\"&gt;rare species&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;. Of particular importance are the saltmarshes of &lt;a href=\"Lindisfarne\"&gt;Lindisfarne&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"River%20Tees\"&gt;Tees Estuary&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Heath%20%28habitat%29\"&gt;heaths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bog\"&gt;bog&lt;/a&gt;s and traditional upland hay meadows of the North Pennines, and the Arctic-alpine flora of Upper Teesdale.\nThe beauty of the &lt;a href=\"Northumberland%20Coast\"&gt;Northumbrian coastline&lt;/a&gt; has led to its designation as an &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;area of outstanding natural beauty&lt;/a&gt; (AONB)\nstretching 100 miles from &lt;a href=\"Berwick-Upon-Tweed\"&gt;Berwick-Upon-Tweed&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"River%20Coquet\"&gt;River Coquet&lt;/a&gt; estuary. Among the 290 bird species identified on the &lt;a href=\"Farne%20Islands\"&gt;Farne Islands&lt;/a&gt;, is the rare &lt;a href=\"seabird\"&gt;seabird&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"roseate%20tern\"&gt;roseate tern&lt;/a&gt;. One of the foremost bird sanctuaries and observatory for migratory and wading birds in the UK is now operated at \"Saltholme\" which is part of a wider site of special scientific interest called &lt;a href=\"Seal%20Sands\"&gt;Seal Sands&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/s/saltholme/\"&gt;Saltholme reserve&lt;/a&gt; is managed by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds\"&gt;Royal Society for the Protection of Birds&lt;/a&gt;(RSPB). This project has been pronounced as one of the best places to view birds by &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Oddie\"&gt;Bill Oddie&lt;/a&gt;, the celebrity bird watcher and former host of the BBC's \"Spring Watch\" Programme. In December 2012 he also presented the project with a prize as the UK's favorite &lt;a href=\"National%20Lottery%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;National Lottery&lt;/a&gt; funded project. The seal colony at Seal Sands on the mouth of the River Tees is thriving and stands at more than 60 &lt;a href=\"harbour%20seals\"&gt;harbour seals&lt;/a&gt; and this is the only breeding colony of this species on the northeast coast.\"&lt;a href=\"Rainton%20Meadows\"&gt;Rainton Meadows&lt;/a&gt;\" is also a recently created bird-watching site. The region is also the English stronghold of black grouse and contains 80\u201390% of the UK population of yellow marsh &lt;a href=\"saxifraga\"&gt;saxifrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Magnesian%20Limestone\"&gt;Magnesian Limestone&lt;/a&gt; grasslands of East Durham are a unique habitat not found nowhere else in the world which is particularly important to many species of butterfly and moths.\nThe Northeast of England also features woodland such as &lt;a href=\"Kielder%20Forest\"&gt;Kielder Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the largest man-made forest in Europe. This is located within Northumberland National Park and contains an important habitat for the &lt;a href=\"endangered\"&gt;endangered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"red%20squirrel\"&gt;red squirrel&lt;/a&gt;."
