    "text": "Oskemen ( ), or Ust-Kamenogorsk (), is the administrative center of &lt;a href=\"East%20Kazakhstan%20Region\"&gt;East Kazakhstan Region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;. Population: \nName.\nThe city has two official names. In the Kazakh language, its name is \u04e8\u0441\u043a\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d/\u0648\u0633\u0643\u06d5\u0645\u06d5\u0646/\"\u00d6skemen\" and in the Russian language it is known as \u0423\u0441\u0442\u044c-\u041a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a. Both names appear on the seal of the city.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded in 1720 at the confluence of the &lt;a href=\"Irtysh\"&gt;Irtysh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulba%20River\"&gt;Ulba&lt;/a&gt; rivers as a &lt;a href=\"fort\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trading%20post\"&gt;trading post&lt;/a&gt; named \"Ust-Kamennaya\". It was established according to the order of the Russian Emperor &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Great\"&gt;Peter the Great&lt;/a&gt;, who sent a military expedition headed by major Ivan Vasilievich Likharev in the search of Yarkenda gold. Likharev\u2019s expedition directed up the Irtysh River to &lt;a href=\"Zaysan%20Lake\"&gt;Zaysan Lake&lt;/a&gt;. There, at the confluence of the Ulba and the Irtysh rivers the new fortress was laid \u2013 the Ust-Kamennaya Fortress. The Ust-Kamennaya Fortress appeared on the map of the Russian Empire, the very southern end of the Irtysh line. In 1868 the city became the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Semipalatinsk%20Oblast%2C%20Russia\"&gt;Semipalatinsk Oblast&lt;/a&gt;. It was the site of &lt;a href=\"Georgy%20Malenkov\"&gt;Georgy Malenkov&lt;/a&gt;'s 30-year internal &lt;a href=\"exile\"&gt;exile&lt;/a&gt;, during which he managed a local hydroelectric plant.\nOne of the main industrial enterprises, the &lt;a href=\"Ulba%20Metal%20Works\"&gt;Ulba Metal Works&lt;/a&gt; (UMW) which produced and still produces uranium products, was kept entirely secret despite it employing thousands of workers. An explosion at the UMW's beryllium production line in 1990 led to the diffusion of a highly toxic beryllium-containing \"cloud\" over the city. The health effects of this incident are not entirely known, partly because the incident was kept secret by the Soviet authorities.\nEconomy.\nThe city developed into a major &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"metallurgy\"&gt;metallurgical&lt;/a&gt; center during the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; period. Processing of &lt;a href=\"non-ferrous%20metals\"&gt;non-ferrous metals&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href=\"uranium\"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beryllium\"&gt;beryllium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tantalum\"&gt;tantalum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"silver\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"zinc\"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; remain important. It is a center for the construction industry producing manufactured housing and &lt;a href=\"ferroconcrete\"&gt;ferroconcrete&lt;/a&gt; articles. The post-war industrial history of the city is very closely intertwined with the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20nuclear%20bomb%20project\"&gt;Soviet nuclear bomb project&lt;/a&gt;, and the city was therefore kept closed to outsiders. \nThe number of enterprises in Oskemen is very high relative to the number of people living there. There are about 169 firms according to the data from 2002. Most of them are industrial firms, working in &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; and processing of raw materials, mostly &lt;a href=\"heavy%20metals\"&gt;heavy metals&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe highest &lt;a href=\"Lock%20%28water%20transport%29\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt; in the world is the Oskemen Lock and lies at Ablaketka where it allows river traffic to pass around a &lt;a href=\"Oskemen%20Hydroelectric%20Power%20Plant\"&gt;hydroelectric dam&lt;/a&gt; on the Irtysh river. It has a drop of more than 40m.\nA new car plant owned jointly by &lt;a href=\"AvtoVAZ\"&gt;AvtoVAZ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azia%20Avto\"&gt;Azia Avto&lt;/a&gt;, which will produce 120,000 cars a year, will be opened in 2016.\nCulture.\nThe city has three cinemas (although during the Soviet era, there were a lot more), three museums, and a drama theater with Russian and Kazakh (since 2000) troupes.\nSport.\n&lt;a href=\"Boris%20Alexandrov%20Sports%20Palace\"&gt;Boris Alexandrov Sports Palace&lt;/a&gt; serves as home arena to the &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Kazzinc-Torpedo\"&gt;HC Torpedo&lt;/a&gt; (officially Kazzinc-Torpedo, commonly referred to as Torpedo Ust-Kamenogorsk). Torpedo\u2019s men\u2019s representative team plays in the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;Supreme Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; (VHL), of which it was a founding member, and the women\u2019s representative team plays in the Kazakh Women's Ice Hockey League. The men\u2019s &lt;a href=\"farm%20team\"&gt;farm team&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ShKO%20Oskemen\"&gt;Altay-Torpedo&lt;/a&gt;, competes in the &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan%20Hockey%20Championship\"&gt;Kazakhstan Hockey Championship&lt;/a&gt; and the men\u2019s under-20 team, &lt;a href=\"Altay%20Oskemen\"&gt;Altay&lt;/a&gt;, plays in the Eastern Conference of the &lt;a href=\"Junior%20Hockey%20League%20%28Russia%29\"&gt;Junior Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; (MHL). Torpedo is the alma mater of &lt;a href=\"National%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt; players &lt;a href=\"Nik%20Antropov\"&gt;Nik Antropov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vitali%20Kolesnik\"&gt;Vitali Kolesnik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evgeni%20Nabokov\"&gt;Evgeni Nabokov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Perezhogin\"&gt;Alexander Perezhogin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Konstantin%20Pushkaryov\"&gt;Konstantin Pushkaryov&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"FC%20Vostok\"&gt;FC Vostok Oskemen&lt;/a&gt; was a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Kazakhstan Premier League&lt;/a&gt; and currently plays in the &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan%20First%20Division\"&gt;Kazakhstan First Division&lt;/a&gt;. The team\u2019s home ground is &lt;a href=\"Vostok%20Stadium\"&gt;Vostok Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nOskemen hosted the national &lt;a href=\"rink%20bandy\"&gt;rink bandy&lt;/a&gt; championship in 2014 and the national amateur &lt;a href=\"bandy\"&gt;bandy&lt;/a&gt; championship in 2018.\nReligion.\nWith ethnic &lt;a href=\"Russians\"&gt;Russians&lt;/a&gt; comprising the demographic majority of the population, &lt;a href=\"Orthodox%20Christianity\"&gt;Orthodox Christianity&lt;/a&gt; is the dominant religion of Oskemen. There are 32 religious unions, presenting 15 religious confessions, including &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;, and non-traditional religions. There are 21 cultural buildings in the city: among them &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Orthodox Christian&lt;/a&gt; churches and &lt;a href=\"mosques\"&gt;mosques&lt;/a&gt;. However, in 2017 a court fined and banned Oskemen's New Life Protestant Church for singing religious songs at a summer camp.\nTransport.\nThe city has an international airport, &lt;a href=\"Oskemen%20Airport\"&gt;Oskemen Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nOskemen's tram system has 4 lines.\nIntercity bus service is available at two bus stations. The most extensive network, with more than 35 lines, is at the railway station, which is located by the Sports Palace on Novoshkolnaya Street. From this station, buses not only serve cities within Kazakhstan, but also Russian cities such as Krasnoyarsk. The route network at the second station covers a smaller area with 17 lines.\nClimate.\nOskemen has a continental climate with (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt; \"Dfb\") intermittent precipitation. The coldest months are November through March. Record low temperatures range from \u221249\u00a0\u00b0C in January to 4\u00a0\u00b0C in July, and record highs range from 8\u00a0\u00b0C in January to 43\u00a0\u00b0C in July.\nEcology.\nAs expected in a city with a lot of heavy industry, the atmosphere of the city holds the by-products of the heavy metals production: &lt;a href=\"nitrogen%20dioxide\"&gt;nitrogen dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sulfur%20dioxide\"&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, Zn, Cd, Cl, As, C, Be, &lt;a href=\"phenol\"&gt;phenol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benzene\"&gt;benzol&lt;/a&gt;, NaOH, NH3, &lt;a href=\"radioactivity\"&gt;radioactivity&lt;/a&gt; etc. in general there are about 170 polluting components found in the city.\nThere are 3 impact points that are influenced in Oskemen. The atmosphere is hit most. With a poor &lt;a href=\"urban%20ventilation\"&gt;urban ventilation&lt;/a&gt; (the average percentage of calm 48%), with a large number of vehicles and stationary sources relevance of &lt;a href=\"air%20pollution\"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt; in Oskemen is not in doubt. The concentration of harmful substances in the air is increasing each year because of the nature of the companies which are looking for increases in the production and profits. As usual, the pollution is enhanced by the low quality of car fuels and an increase in the number of cars. As a result of all this, Oskemen is often recognized as one of the most &lt;a href=\"polluted\"&gt;polluted&lt;/a&gt; regional centers of Kazakhstan.\nThe most polluted rivers of the Republic are those flowing through the territory of the East Kazakhstan region, where the highest index of surface water pollution is observed in the mining areas and enrichment of &lt;a href=\"polymetal\"&gt;polymetal&lt;/a&gt;lic ores. Mostly the water is affected through the &lt;a href=\"industrial%20waste\"&gt;industrial waste&lt;/a&gt;s and the storages of waste. &lt;a href=\"water%20contamination\"&gt;Contamination of the water&lt;/a&gt; with lead, &lt;a href=\"selenium\"&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt;, cadmium, &lt;a href=\"nitrates\"&gt;nitrates&lt;/a&gt; spreads on many kilometers as a consequence of which a few &lt;a href=\"drinking%20water\"&gt;drinking water&lt;/a&gt; intakes in the Western part of the city are closed or to be closed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"soil%20contamination\"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt; close to the industry territories holds the &lt;a href=\"solid%20waste\"&gt;solid waste&lt;/a&gt;s of the firms and becomes less suitable for planting. An increasing number of industrial waste requires a large area for the storage of waste.\nAs a result of large production of uranium and presence of other radioactive elements such thorium, radon or radioactive dust the radioactive background of the city is remarkable with the zones of radioactive anomaly which are spread around the city.\nOskemen is known to be the leader in Kazakhstan by the number of people having respiratory problems and the diseases of immune system. The statistics show that the most frequent diseases are respiratory diseases and urogenital system diseases. In the last years, the number of people having cancer has been also increasing.\nEconomy.\nIn the 1950s, the heavy industrial economy began to develop in the city. In 1959 a mechanical workshop for boilers and tools was built in the city. Today, the city has a large machine-building plant, automobile plant and metallurgical plant.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nOskemen is &lt;a href=\"Sister%20city\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with:"
