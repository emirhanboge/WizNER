He attended &lt;a href=\"Staunton%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;Staunton Military Academy&lt;/a&gt; from 1923 to 1924 and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;United States Military Academy&lt;/a&gt; (USMA) at West Point from 1924 to 1928. Upon graduation from &lt;a href=\"West%20Point%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;West Point, New York&lt;/a&gt;, he was &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"second%20lieutenant%23United%20States\"&gt;second lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Coast%20Artillery%20Corps\"&gt;Coast Artillery Corps&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20College\"&gt;U.S. Army Command and General Staff College&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Leavenworth\"&gt;Fort Leavenworth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; in 1939.\nWorld War II.\nIn 1942, after the United States entered &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;attack on Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, after serving as a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20%28military%29\"&gt;staff officer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20War\"&gt;War Department&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt;, Frederick was tasked with raising a new U.S.-Canadian regiment size &lt;a href=\"commando\"&gt;commando&lt;/a&gt; force which became the &lt;a href=\"First%20Special%20Service%20Force\"&gt;1st Special Service Force&lt;/a&gt; (later called the \"Devil's Brigade\" by the Germans). The unit, activated on July 9, 1942 at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20William%20Henry%20Harrison\"&gt;Fort William Henry Harrison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Montana\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;, was originally intended for commando operations in &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, and trained extensively in &lt;a href=\"Winter%20warfare\"&gt;winter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mountain%20warfare\"&gt;mountain warfare&lt;/a&gt;, as well as hand-to-hand combat and other infantry skills. In April 1943, the unit moved to &lt;a href=\"Vermont\"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt; for training, first at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Bradford\"&gt;Camp Bradford&lt;/a&gt; and then at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ethan%20Allen\"&gt;Fort Ethan Allen&lt;/a&gt;. The Norway mission was cancelled, however, and the 1st Special Service Force was sent instead to the &lt;a href=\"Aleutian%20Islands\"&gt;Aleutian Islands&lt;/a&gt; in July 1943. It returned to the contiguous United States in September, and then left in October for the &lt;a href=\"European%20Theater%20of%20Operations%2C%20United%20States%20Army\"&gt;European Theater of Operations&lt;/a&gt; (ETO).\nFrederick's men arrived in &lt;a href=\"Casablanca\"&gt;Casablanca&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"French%20protectorate%20in%20Morocco\"&gt;French Morocco&lt;/a&gt; in November 1943 and quickly moved to the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;Italian front&lt;/a&gt;. Landing at &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt; on November 19, 1943, the 1st Special Service Force went into the line. In December 1943 and January 1944, the 1st Special Service Force conducted a series of operations at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Monte%20la%20Difensa\"&gt;Monte la Difensa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monte%20la%20Remetanea\"&gt;Monte la Remetanea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Sammucro\"&gt;Monte Sammucro&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Hill%20720\"&gt;Hill 720&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Vischiataro\"&gt;Monte Vischiataro&lt;/a&gt;. The 1st Special Service Force attacked and captured the enemy forces at the impregnable Monte la Difensa.\nOn February 2, 1944, Frederick, now a full &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;, and his men &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Anzio\"&gt;landed at Anzio&lt;/a&gt; and went into action along the &lt;a href=\"Mussolini%20Canal\"&gt;Mussolini Canal&lt;/a&gt;. They were the first &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; troops to enter the Italian capital of &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; on June 4, 1944. Frederick was decorated twice with the &lt;a href=\"Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Distinguished Service Cross&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. Army's second highest award for valor in combat. The first award was for actions on January 10\u201313, 1944 and the second award for actions on June 4, 1944. While at &lt;a href=\"Anzio\"&gt;Anzio&lt;/a&gt; he was wounded a number of times, including two separate wounds on a single day.\nOn June 23, 1944, Frederick announced he was leaving the unit. He was promoted to the &lt;a href=\"one-star%20rank\"&gt;one-star&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"general%20officer\"&gt;general officer&lt;/a&gt; rank of &lt;a href=\"Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;brigadier general&lt;/a&gt; in July, and was given command of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Airborne%20Task%20Force%20%28Allied%29\"&gt;1st Allied Airborne Task Force&lt;/a&gt;, an ad hoc &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt;-sized airborne formation, for the Allied &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Dragoon\"&gt;invasion of Southern France&lt;/a&gt;; he was the youngest general to command a division-size unit in World War II. The task force consisted of the &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Parachute%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;British 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade&lt;/a&gt; and the American &lt;a href=\"509th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;509th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"551st%20Parachute%20Infantry%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;551st Parachute Infantry Battalion&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"517th%20Parachute%20Regimental%20Combat%20Team\"&gt;517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"550th%20Airborne%20Infantry%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;550th Glider Infantry Battalion&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"460th%20Parachute%20Field%20Artillery%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;460th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"463rd%20Parachute%20Field%20Artillery%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;463rd Parachute Field Artillery Battalion&lt;/a&gt;s, along with various support units.\nOn August 15, under the code name \"Rugby Force\", the unit jumped into the &lt;a href=\"Argens%20Valley\"&gt;Argens Valley&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Le%20Luc\"&gt;Le Luc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Le%20Muy\"&gt;Le Muy&lt;/a&gt;, behind the &lt;a href=\"Massif%20des%20Maures\"&gt;Massif des Maures&lt;/a&gt;, a key piece of terrain which overlooked the Allied landing beaches near &lt;a href=\"St.%20Tropez\"&gt;St. Tropez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saint-Rapha%C3%ABl%2C%20Var\"&gt;St. Rapha\u00ebl&lt;/a&gt;. Having successfully blocked German forces from reaching the invasion beaches, the 1st Airborne Task Force linked up with the &lt;a href=\"36th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;U.S. 36th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; on August 17, 1944. It then moved up the &lt;a href=\"French%20Riviera\"&gt;French Riviera&lt;/a&gt; coastline, taking &lt;a href=\"Cannes\"&gt;Cannes&lt;/a&gt; unopposed on August 24, 1944 and linking up with Frederick's old unit, the 1st Special Service Force. The 1st Special Service Force had initially been tasked to seize several small islands off the &lt;a href=\"French%20Riviera\"&gt;French Riviera&lt;/a&gt; and then moved onshore, where it was attached to the 1st Airborne Task Force on August 22 (replacing the British 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade). The task force then fought on to the French-Italian border, where it took up defensive positions. The task force was dissolved on November 23, 1944 (and the 1st Special Service Force was disbanded on December 5).\nFrederick was, at the age of just 37, promoted to the &lt;a href=\"two-star%20rank\"&gt;two-star rank&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;major general&lt;/a&gt; and given command of the &lt;a href=\"45th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;45th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; on December 3, 1944. Along with Major General &lt;a href=\"James%20M.%20Gavin\"&gt;James M. Gavin&lt;/a&gt;, then commanding the &lt;a href=\"82nd%20Airborne%20Division\"&gt;82nd Airborne Division&lt;/a&gt;, this made both Frederick and Gavin (eight days younger than Frederick) the two youngest division commanders in the U.S. Army during the war. He led the 45th Division until September 10, 1945. The 45th saw heavy combat in French &lt;a href=\"Alsace\"&gt;Alsace&lt;/a&gt; from December 1944 through to February 1945, and was pulled from the line to rehabilitate on February 17. In mid-March, it was assigned to &lt;a href=\"XV%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;XV Corps&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Undertone\"&gt;Operation Undertone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Allied%20invasion%20of%20Germany\"&gt;final drive into Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe division crossed the &lt;a href=\"Rhine\"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt; and advanced to the &lt;a href=\"Main%20%28river%29\"&gt;Main&lt;/a&gt;. Moving along the Main into &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, participating in heavy fighting in &lt;a href=\"Aschaffenburg\"&gt;Aschaffenburg&lt;/a&gt; from March 28 to April 3 and then drove to &lt;a href=\"Nuremberg\"&gt;Nuremberg&lt;/a&gt;, taken in heavy fighting from April 16\u201320. Moving south, the division crossed the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; on April 26, and opened up the path for the &lt;a href=\"20th%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;U.S. 20th Armored Division&lt;/a&gt; to drive on &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;. Reaching &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; on April 29, the division shifted from combat to occupation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Churchill\"&gt;Sir Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt;, declared that \"Robert Frederick\" was \"the greatest fighting general of all time\" and \"if we had had a dozen more like him we would have smashed &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt; in 1942\".\nPost-World War II.\nAfter a period of occupation duty, the &lt;a href=\"45th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;45th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; prepared to return to the United States and Frederick relinquished command in September 1945. From 1 November 1945 to 19 August 1947 he was commandant of the &lt;a href=\"Coast%20Artillery%20School\"&gt;Coast Artillery School&lt;/a&gt;, and presided over its move from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Monroe\"&gt;Fort Monroe&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Winfield%20Scott\"&gt;Fort Winfield Scott&lt;/a&gt;. After a period of staff duty and recuperation (he had been wounded eight times), Major General Frederick was assigned to Allied occupation forces in &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, commanding the U.S. Sector, of the &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; Inter-Allied Command in 1948. From February 28, 1949 to October 10, 1950, he commanded the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%204th%20Infantry%20Division\"&gt;4th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt;, which had been reactivated as a training division at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ord\"&gt;Fort Ord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; in 1947. In October 1950, the division was redesignated the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%206th%20Infantry%20Division\"&gt;6th Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt;, and Frederick continued as its commanding general until 1951.\nIn 1951, Frederick returned to Europe to take command of the &lt;a href=\"Joint%20U.S.%20Military%20Aid%20Group\"&gt;Joint U.S. Military Aid Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; (JUSMAG Greece). He retired on disability in March 1952. In the 1968 film \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Devil%27s%20Brigade%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Devil's Brigade&lt;/a&gt;\", which chronicled the formation, training and combat in Italy of the 1st Special Service Force, Robert T. Frederick was played by actor &lt;a href=\"William%20Holden\"&gt;William Holden&lt;/a&gt;. Frederick died on November 29, 1970 in &lt;a href=\"Stanford%2C%20California\"&gt;Stanford, California&lt;/a&gt;.\nV-42 combat knife.\nThe &lt;a href=\"V-42%20combat%20knife\"&gt;V-42 combat knife&lt;/a&gt; was designed in part by Frederick when commanding officer of the 1st Special Service Force. The V-42 was the trademark weapon of the 1st Special Service Force, and its members were trained extensively in its use. It is a short-bladed stiletto with a thumb groove on the top of the blade to promote proper hand placement when attacking an opponent. It is often confused with the longer- and thicker-bladed &lt;a href=\"Fairbairn-Sykes%20fighting%20knife\"&gt;Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife&lt;/a&gt;. The profile of the V-42 knife appears in the crests of the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Forces%20%28United%20States%20Army%29\"&gt;U.S. Army Special Forces&lt;/a&gt; and Canada's &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Task%20Force%20Two\"&gt;Joint Task Force Two&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary awards.\nFrederick's military decorations and awards include:\nDistinguished Service Cross Citation (1st Award).\nRank: Brigadier General (then colonel)&lt;br&gt;\nUnit: 1st Special Service Force&lt;br&gt;\nAwarded on: 1944&lt;br&gt;\nAction: January 10 to 13, 1944&lt;br&gt;\nGeneral Orders: Headquarters, Fifth U.S. Army, General Orders No. 102 (1944)\nDistinguished Service Cross Citation (2nd Award).\nRank: Major General (then colonel)&lt;br&gt;\nUnit: 1st Special Service Force&lt;br&gt;\nAwarded on: 1944&lt;br&gt;\nAction: June 4, 1944&lt;br&gt;\nGeneral Orders: Headquarters, Fifth U.S. Army, General Orders No. 102 (1944)"
