    "text": "USS \"Fresno\" (LST-1182) was the fourth &lt;a href=\"tank%20landing%20ship\"&gt;tank landing ship&lt;/a&gt; (LST) of the . \"Fresno\" was named for a &lt;a href=\"Fresno%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. The vessel was constructed by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Steel%20and%20Shipbuilding%20Company\"&gt;National Steel and Shipbuilding Company&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego\"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, California and &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in 1968. The ship entered service in 1969 and was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet\"&gt;United States Pacific Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, taking part in training along the west coast and operational cruises to the western Pacific, taking part in the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;. \"Fresno\" was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20decommissioning\"&gt;decommissioned&lt;/a&gt; in 1993 and laid up. The LST was nearly sold to Peru but remained in the U.S. inventory until 2014, when \"Fresno\" was sunk as a &lt;a href=\"target%20ship\"&gt;target ship&lt;/a&gt; in the Pacific Ocean during a &lt;a href=\"Military%20exercise\"&gt;training exercise&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign and description.\n\"Fresno\" was a which were designed to meet the goal put forward by the United States &lt;a href=\"Amphibious%20warfare\"&gt;amphibious forces&lt;/a&gt; to have a tank landing ship (LST) capable of over . However, the traditional &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow door&lt;/a&gt; form for LSTs would not be capable. Therefore, the designers of the \"Newport\" class came up with a design of a traditional &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;ship hull&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt; ramp slung over the bow supported by two &lt;a href=\"derrick\"&gt;derrick&lt;/a&gt; arms. The ramp was capable of sustaining loads up to . This made the \"Newport\" class the first to depart from the standard LST design that had been developed in early &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Fresno\" had a &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displacement&lt;/a&gt; of when light and at full load. The LST was &lt;a href=\"Length%20overall\"&gt;long overall&lt;/a&gt; and over the &lt;a href=\"derrick\"&gt;derrick&lt;/a&gt; arms which protruded past the bow. The vessel had a &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of , a &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; forward of and at the stern at full load.\n\"Fresno\" was fitted with six &lt;a href=\"Alco\"&gt;Alco&lt;/a&gt; 16-645-ES &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s turning two &lt;a href=\"Propeller\"&gt;shafts&lt;/a&gt;, three to each shaft. The system was rated at and gave the ship a maximum speed of for short periods and could only sustain for an extended length of time. The LST carried of &lt;a href=\"diesel%20fuel\"&gt;diesel fuel&lt;/a&gt; for a range of at the cruising speed of . The ship was also equipped with a &lt;a href=\"bow%20thruster\"&gt;bow thruster&lt;/a&gt; to allow for better maneuvering near causeways and to hold position while offshore during the unloading of amphibious vehicles.\nThe \"Newport\" class were larger and faster than previous LSTs and were able to transport tanks, heavy vehicles and engineer groups and supplies that were too large for helicopters or smaller landing craft to carry. The LSTs have a ramp forward of the &lt;a href=\"superstructure\"&gt;superstructure&lt;/a&gt; that connects the lower tank deck with the main deck and a passage large enough to allow access to the parking area amidships. The vessels are also equipped with a stern gate to allow the unloading of amphibious vehicles directly into the water or to unload onto a &lt;a href=\"Landing%20Craft%20Utility\"&gt;utility landing craft&lt;/a&gt; (LCU) or pier. At either end of the tank deck there is a turntable that permits vehicles to turn around without having to reverse. The \"Newport\" class has the capacity for of vehicles, of cargo area and could carry up to 431 troops. The vessels also have &lt;a href=\"davit\"&gt;davit&lt;/a&gt;s for four &lt;a href=\"LCVP%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;vehicle and personnel landing craft&lt;/a&gt; (LCVPs) and could carry four pontoon causeway sections along the sides of the hull.\n\"Fresno\" was initially armed with four Mark 33 &lt;a href=\"3%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20gun\"&gt;/50 caliber guns&lt;/a&gt; in two twin &lt;a href=\"Gun%20turret\"&gt;turrets&lt;/a&gt;. The vessel was equipped with two Mk 63 &lt;a href=\"Ship%20gun%20fire-control%20system\"&gt;gun control fire systems&lt;/a&gt; (GCFS) for the 3-inch guns, but these were removed in 1977\u20131978. The ship also had SPS-10 surface search &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;. Atop the stern gate, the vessels mounted a &lt;a href=\"helicopter%20deck\"&gt;helicopter deck&lt;/a&gt;. They had a maximum complement of 213 including 11 officers.\nConstruction and career.\nThe LST was ordered as part of the second group of \"Newport\"-class ships in Fiscal Year 1966 on 15 July 1966 and was laid down on 16 December 1967 at &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego\"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Steel%20and%20Shipbuilding%20Company\"&gt;National Steel and Shipbuilding Company&lt;/a&gt;. Named for a &lt;a href=\"Fresno%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; in California, \"Fresno\" was &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 28 September 1968, sponsored by Mrs. Marilyn Hyde, the wife of the mayor of &lt;a href=\"Fresno%2C%20California\"&gt;Fresno&lt;/a&gt;, California. The vessel was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; on 22 November 1969.\n\"Fresno\" was assigned to the Amphibious Force, Pacific Fleet, and homeported at San Diego. The LST alternated between training operations along the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20West%20Coast\"&gt;west coast of the United States&lt;/a&gt; and regular deployments to the western Pacific. The ship saw extensive service during the latter stages of the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; and earned two &lt;a href=\"battle%20star\"&gt;battle star&lt;/a&gt;s. \"Fresno\" was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20decommissioning\"&gt;decommissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 8 April 1993 and was struck from the United States &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Vessel%20Register\"&gt;Naval Vessel Register&lt;/a&gt; on 1 December 2008. In 2009, along with , \"Fresno\" was reported to be sold to the &lt;a href=\"Peruvian%20Navy\"&gt;Peruvian Navy&lt;/a&gt;. However, this Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case was never executed and the ship remained under the control of the U.S. Navy following its decommissioning. On 15 September 2014, ex-\"Fresno\" was sunk as a &lt;a href=\"target%20ship\"&gt;target ship&lt;/a&gt; in waters deep, northeast of &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Military%20exercise\"&gt;naval exercise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Exercise%20Valiant%20Shield\"&gt;Exercise Valiant Shield&lt;/a&gt; 2014."
