    "text": "Neapolitan (&lt;a href=\"Exonym%20and%20endonym\"&gt;autonym&lt;/a&gt;: (\"\u2019o n\")\"napulitano\" ; ) is a &lt;a href=\"Romance%20language\"&gt;Romance language&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Italo-Dalmatian%20languages\"&gt;Italo-Dalmatian group&lt;/a&gt; spoken across much of mainland &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Italy\"&gt;Southern Italy&lt;/a&gt;, except for southern &lt;a href=\"Calabria\"&gt;Calabria&lt;/a&gt; and southern &lt;a href=\"Apulia\"&gt;Apulia&lt;/a&gt;, and spoken in a small part of &lt;a href=\"central%20Italy\"&gt;central Italy&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20Ascoli%20Piceno\"&gt;province of Ascoli Piceno&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Marche\"&gt;Marche&lt;/a&gt;). It is named after the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Naples\"&gt;Kingdom of Naples&lt;/a&gt; that once covered most of the area, of which the city of &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt; was the capital. On October 14, 2008, a law by the Region of &lt;a href=\"Campania\"&gt;Campania&lt;/a&gt; stated that Neapolitan was to be protected.\nThe term \"Neapolitan language\" is used broadly in this article to refer to the group of closely-related Romance dialects found in southern continental Italy, as described above. However, as the term itself implies, it may also refer more specifically to the language native to the city of Naples and its metropolitan area. In contexts ranging from colloquial speech to academic linguistics, \u201cNeapolitan\", \"napulitano\" or \"napoletano\" often refer to the specific &lt;a href=\"variety%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;varieties&lt;/a&gt; spoken in Naples and the immediately surrounding &lt;a href=\"Naples%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Naples metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistribution.\nIn the broad view adopted here, the Neapolitan dialects are distributed throughout most of continental &lt;a href=\"southern%20Italy\"&gt;southern Italy&lt;/a&gt;, historically united during the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Naples\"&gt;Kingdom of Naples&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies\"&gt;Kingdom of the Two Sicilies&lt;/a&gt;, specifically southern &lt;a href=\"Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Gaeta\"&gt;Gaeta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sora%2C%20Lazio\"&gt;Sora&lt;/a&gt; districts), southern &lt;a href=\"Marche\"&gt;Marche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abruzzo\"&gt;Abruzzo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molise\"&gt;Molise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Basilicata\"&gt;Basilicata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Campania\"&gt;Campania&lt;/a&gt; (Naples), northern and central &lt;a href=\"Apulia\"&gt;Apulia&lt;/a&gt;, and northernmost &lt;a href=\"Calabria\"&gt;Calabria&lt;/a&gt;. The dialects are part of a varied &lt;a href=\"dialect%20continuum\"&gt;dialect continuum&lt;/a&gt;, so the varieties in southern Lazio, Marche, Abruzzo, Molise, Apulia, Lucania and Calabria can typically be recognizable as regional groups of dialects. In western Abruzzo and Lazio the dialects give way to &lt;a href=\"Central%20Italian\"&gt;Central Italian&lt;/a&gt; dialects such as &lt;a href=\"Romanesco%20dialect\"&gt;Romanesco&lt;/a&gt;. In central Calabria and southern Apulia, the dialects give way to the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20language\"&gt;Sicilian language&lt;/a&gt;.\nLargely due to massive Southern Italian migration in the late 19th century and 20th century, there are also a number of Neapolitan speakers in &lt;a href=\"Italian%20diaspora\"&gt;Italian diaspora&lt;/a&gt; communities in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. However, in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, traditional Neapolitan has had considerable contact with &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20language\"&gt;Sicilian language&lt;/a&gt;s spoken by Sicilian and Calabrian immigrants living alongside Neapolitan-speaking immigrants, and, subsequently, Neapolitan in the U.S. is now significantly different from contemporary Neapolitan spoken in &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;. English words are often used in place of Neapolitan words, especially among second-generation speakers. On the other hand, the effect of &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Italian\"&gt;Standard Italian&lt;/a&gt; on Neapolitan in Italy has been similar due to the increasing displacement of Neapolitan by Standard Italian in daily speech.\nThe following dialects constitute Neapolitan; numbers refer to the map:\nThe southernmost regions of Italy\u2014most of Calabria, southern Apulia, and southern Salerno (&lt;a href=\"Cilento\"&gt;Cilento&lt;/a&gt; region) as well as Sicily\u2014are home to &lt;a href=\"Sicilian%20language\"&gt;Sicilian&lt;/a&gt; rather than Neapolitan.\nClassification.\nNeapolitan is a &lt;a href=\"Romance%20language\"&gt;Romance language&lt;/a&gt; and is generally considered one of the Italo-Romance branch of the &lt;a href=\"Italo-Dalmatian%20languages\"&gt;Italo-Dalmatian languages&lt;/a&gt;. There are notable differences among the various dialects, but they are all generally mutually intelligible.\n&lt;a href=\"Italian%20language\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; and Neapolitan are of variable mutual comprehensibility, depending on factors that are both affective and linguistic. There are notable grammatical differences, such as Neapolitan having nouns in the neuter form and a unique plural formation as well as historical phonological developments, which often obscure the cognacy of lexical items.\nIts evolution has been similar to that of Italian and other Romance languages from their roots in &lt;a href=\"Vulgar%20Latin\"&gt;Vulgar Latin&lt;/a&gt;. It may reflect a pre-Latin &lt;a href=\"Oscan%20language\"&gt;Oscan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stratum%20%28linguistics%29%23Substratum\"&gt;substratum&lt;/a&gt;, as in the pronunciation of the \"d\" sound as an \"r\" sound (&lt;a href=\"rhotacism%20%28sound%20change%29\"&gt;rhotacism&lt;/a&gt;) at the beginning of a word or between two vowels: e.g. \"doje\" (feminine) or \"duje\" (masculine), meaning \"two\", is pronounced, and often spelled, as \"roje\"/\"ruje\"; \"ved\u00e9\" (\"to see\") as \"ver\u00e9\", and often spelled so; also \"cad\u00e9\"/\"car\u00e9\" (\"to fall\") and \"&lt;a href=\"Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt;\"/\"Maronna\"). Another purported Oscan influence is the historical assimilation of the consonant cluster as , pronounced (this is generally reflected in spelling more consistently: vs Italian \"world\"; vs \nItalian \"when\"), along with the development of as ~ ( vs Italian \"drum\"), also consistently reflected in spelling. Other effects of the Oscan &lt;a href=\"substratum\"&gt;substratum&lt;/a&gt; are postulated, but substratum claims are highly controversial. As in many other languages in the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Italian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, Neapolitan has an &lt;a href=\"Stratum%20%28linguistics%29%23Adstratum\"&gt;adstratum&lt;/a&gt; greatly influenced by other &lt;a href=\"Romance%20languages\"&gt;Romance languages&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Catalan%20language\"&gt;Catalan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Franco-Proven%C3%A7al\"&gt;Franco-Proven\u00e7al&lt;/a&gt; above all), &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20languages\"&gt;Germanic languages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; (both ancient and modern). The language had never been standardised, and the word for \"tree\" has three different spellings: , and .\nNeapolitan has enjoyed a rich literary, &lt;a href=\"Neapolitan%20music\"&gt;musical&lt;/a&gt; and theatrical history (notably &lt;a href=\"Giambattista%20Basile\"&gt;Giambattista Basile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20De%20Filippo\"&gt;Eduardo De Filippo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salvatore%20Di%20Giacomo\"&gt;Salvatore Di Giacomo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tot%C3%B2\"&gt;Tot\u00f2&lt;/a&gt;). Thanks to this heritage and the musical work of &lt;a href=\"Renato%20Carosone\"&gt;Renato Carosone&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s, Neapolitan is still in use in popular music, even gaining national popularity in the songs of &lt;a href=\"Pino%20Daniele\"&gt;Pino Daniele&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nuova%20Compagnia%20di%20Canto%20Popolare\"&gt;Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe language has no official status within Italy and is not taught in schools. The &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Naples%20Federico%20II\"&gt;University of Naples Federico II&lt;/a&gt; offers (from 2003) courses in Campanian Dialectology at the faculty of Sociology, whose actual aim is not teaching students to speak the language, but studying its history, usage, literature and social role. There are also ongoing legislative attempts at the national level to have it recognized as an official &lt;a href=\"minority%20language\"&gt;minority language&lt;/a&gt; of Italy. It is however a recognized &lt;a href=\"International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization\"&gt;ISO&lt;/a&gt; 639 Joint Advisory Committee language with the language code of \"nap\".\nHere is the &lt;a href=\"International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet\"&gt;IPA&lt;/a&gt; pronunciation of the Neapolitan spoken in the city of Naples:\nAlphabet and pronunciation.\nNeapolitan orthography consists of 22 &lt;a href=\"Latin%20alphabet\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; letters. Much like &lt;a href=\"Italian%20orthography\"&gt;Italian orthography&lt;/a&gt;, it does not contain \"k,\" \"w,\" \"x,\" or \"y\" even though these letters might be found in some foreign words; unlike Italian, it does contain the letter \"j\". The English pronunciation guidelines that follow are based on &lt;a href=\"General%20American\"&gt;General American&lt;/a&gt; pronunciation and the values used may not be applicable to other dialects. (See also: &lt;a href=\"International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet%20chart%20for%20English%20dialects\"&gt;International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects&lt;/a&gt;.)\nAll Romance languages are closely related. Although Neapolitan shares a high degree of its vocabulary with Italian, the official language of Italy, differences in pronunciation often make the connection unrecognizable to those without knowledge of Neapolitan. The most striking phonological difference is the Neapolitan weakening of unstressed vowels into &lt;a href=\"schwa\"&gt;schwa&lt;/a&gt; (\"schwa\" is pronounced like the \"a\" in \"about\" or the \"u\" in \"upon\"). However it is also possible (and quite common for some Neapolitans) to speak standard Italian with a \"Neapolitan accent\"; that is, by pronouncing un-stressed vowels as schwa or by pronouncing the letter s as (like the \"sh\" in \"ship\") instead of (like the \"s\" in \"sea\" or the \"ss\" in \"pass\") when the letter is in initial position followed by a consonant, but not when it is followed by a dental occlusive or (at least in the purest form of the language) but by otherwise using only entirely standard words and grammatical forms. This is not Neapolitan proper, but a mere difference in Italian pronunciation.\nTherefore, while pronunciation presents the strongest barrier to comprehension, the grammar of Neapolitan is what sets it apart from Italian. In Neapolitan, for example, the gender and number of a word is expressed by a change in the accented vowel, whereas in Italian it is expressed by a change in the final vowel (e.g. \"luongo\" , \"longa\" ; Italian \"lungo, \"lunga; masc. \"long\", fem. \"long\"). These and other morpho-syntactic differences distinguish the Neapolitan language from the Italian language and the Neapolitan accent.\nNeapolitan has had a significant influence on the intonation of &lt;a href=\"Rioplatense%20Spanish\"&gt;Rioplatense Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, and the whole of &lt;a href=\"Uruguay\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;.\nVowels.\nWhile there are only five graphic vowels in Neapolitan, phonemically, there are eight. Stressed vowels \"e\" and \"o\" can be either \"&lt;a href=\"Close%20vowel\"&gt;closed&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Open%20vowel\"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt;\" and the pronunciation is different for the two. The grave accent (\"\u00e0\", \"\u00e8\", \"\u00f2\") is used to denote open vowels, and the acute accent (\"\u00e9\", \"\u00ed\", \"\u00f3\", \"\u00fa\") is used to denote closed vowels, with alternative \"\u00ec\" and \"\u00f9\". However, accent marks are not commonly used in the actual spelling of words except when they occur on the final syllable of a word, such as \"Tot\u00f2\", \"arriv\u00e0\", or \"pecch\u00e9\" and when they appear here in other positions it is only to demonstrate where the stress, or accent, falls in some words. Also, the &lt;a href=\"circumflex\"&gt;circumflex&lt;/a&gt; is used to mark a long vowel where it wouldn't normally occur (e.g. \"s\u00ee\" \"you are\").\nDigraphs and trigraphs.\nThe following clusters are always &lt;a href=\"gemination\"&gt;geminated&lt;/a&gt; if vowel-following.\nGrammar.\nDefinite articles.\nThe Neapolitan classical &lt;a href=\"definite%20article\"&gt;definite article&lt;/a&gt;s (corresponding to the English word \"the\") are \"la\" (feminine singular), \"lo\" (masculine singular) and \"li\" (plural for both), but in reality these forms will probably only be found in older literature (along with \"lu\" and even \"el\"), of which there is much to be found. Modern Neapolitan uses, almost entirely, shortened forms of these articles which are:\nBefore a word beginning with a consonant:\nThese definite articles are always pronounced distinctly.\nBefore a word beginning with a vowel, \"l\u2019\" or \"ll\u2019\" are used \nfor both masculine and feminine, for both singular and plural. Although both forms can be found, the \"ll\u2019\" form is by far the most common.\nIt is well to note that in Neapolitan the &lt;a href=\"Grammatical%20gender\"&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; of a noun is not easily determined by the article, so other means must be used. In the case of \"\u2019o\" which can be either masculine singular or neuter singular (there is no neuter plural in Neapolitan), when it is neuter the initial consonant of the noun is doubled. As an example, the name of a language in Neapolitan is always neuter, so if we see \"\u2019o nnapulitano\" we know it refers to the Neapolitan language, whereas \"\u2019o napulitano\" would refer to a Neapolitan man.\nLikewise, since \"\u2019e\" can be either masculine plural or feminine plural, when it is feminine plural, the initial consonant of the noun is doubled. As an example, consider \"\u2019a lista\" which in Neapolitan is feminine singular for \"list.\" In the plural it becomes \"\u2019e lliste\".\nThere can also be problems with nouns whose singular form ends in \"e\". Since plural nouns usually end in \"e\" whether masculine or feminine, the masculine plural is often formed by orthographically changing the spelling. As an example, consider the word \"guaglione\" (which means \"boy\", or \"girl\" in the feminine form):\nMore will be said about these orthographically changing nouns in the section on Neapolitan nouns.\nA couple of notes about consonant doubling:\nIndefinite articles.\nThe Neapolitan indefinite articles, corresponding to the English \"a\" or \"an\", are presented in the following table:\nVerbal conjugation.\nIn Neapolitan there are four finite moods: &lt;a href=\"indicative%20mood\"&gt;indicative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"subjunctive%20mood\"&gt;subjunctive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"conditional%20mood\"&gt;conditional&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"imperative%20mood\"&gt;imperative&lt;/a&gt;, and three non-finite modes: &lt;a href=\"infinitive\"&gt;infinitive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gerund\"&gt;gerund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"participle\"&gt;participle&lt;/a&gt;. Each mood has an &lt;a href=\"active%20voice\"&gt;active&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"passive%20voice\"&gt;passive&lt;/a&gt; form. The only auxiliary verbs used in the active form is (Eng. \"to have\", It. \"avere\"), which contrasts with Italian in which the intransitive and reflexive verbs take \"\u00e8ssere\" for their auxiliary. For example, we have:\nDoubled initial consonants.\nIn Neapolitan, many times the initial consonant of a word is doubled. This is called \"&lt;a href=\"raddoppiamento%20sintattico\"&gt;raddoppiamento sintattico&lt;/a&gt;\" in Italian as it also applies to the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20phonology\"&gt;Italian phonology&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, when there is a pause after the \"trigger\" word, the phonological doubling does not occur (e.g. \"tu s\u00ee (g)guaglione\", [You are a boy], where \"s\u00ee\" is a \"trigger\" word causing doubling of the initial consonant in \"guaglione\" but in the phrase \"\u2019e do s\u00ee, guagli\u00f3?\" [Where are you from, boy?] no doubling occurs). Neither does doubling occur when the initial consonant is followed by another consonant (e.g. \"\u2019o ttaliano\" [the Italian language], but \"\u2019o spagnuolo\" [the Spanish language], where \"\u2019o\" is the neuter definite article).\nThis is what happens phonologically and no orthographic change is required. The same thing happens in Italian, where multiple words trigger first-consonant doubling, e.g. \"la casa\" but \"a (c)casa\", \"io e (t)te\", etc.\nAdditional sources.\nFirst public document in Neapolitan Language of the XXI century according to a text of Dr.Verde; the touristic Map of the III Municipality of Naples in Neapolitan Language:"
