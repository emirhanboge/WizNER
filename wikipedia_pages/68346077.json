This came as a shock to his family as he was not considered to be a boxer. He was the youngest of three boys and was closest to his mum. He was inspired by the Olympic Spirit from a young age, having photos of &lt;a href=\"Cathy%20Freeman\"&gt;Cathy Freeman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Thorpe\"&gt;Ian Thorpe&lt;/a&gt; on his bedroom ceiling to inspire him.\nGarside joined the &lt;a href=\"Lilydale%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Lilydale&lt;/a&gt; Youth Club which became his second home. He was at first to be an easy target and lost 10 of his first 18 fights. Garside harnessed an underdog mentality and he was motivated to train harder.\nGarside is employed as a &lt;a href=\"plumber\"&gt;plumber&lt;/a&gt;. He wore &lt;a href=\"nail%20polish\"&gt;nail polish&lt;/a&gt; during the 2020 Olympics, citing his desire to defy &lt;a href=\"gender%20stereotypes\"&gt;gender stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;."
