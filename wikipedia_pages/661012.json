    "text": "search.ch is a &lt;a href=\"search%20engine\"&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"web%20portal\"&gt;web portal&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded in 1995 by Rudolf R\u00e4ber and Bernhard Seefeld as a regional search engine. In the following years many other services were added, such as a phonebook in 1999 and a free &lt;a href=\"Short%20message%20service\"&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt; service in 2000 (now reduced to only one free SMS per week).\nThe search technology is home grown. The user can restrict his search to regions of Switzerland, such as a &lt;a href=\"cantons%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;canton&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"web%20crawler\"&gt;web crawler&lt;/a&gt; looks only at sites in the &lt;a href=\".ch\"&gt;.ch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\".li\"&gt;.li&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"top-level%20domain\"&gt;top-level domain&lt;/a&gt;s and a number of automatically and manually updated list of Swiss websites on other domains. The index is updated weekly."
