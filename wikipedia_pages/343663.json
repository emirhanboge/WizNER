    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, the limit of a &lt;a href=\"sequence\"&gt;sequence&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Set%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;sets&lt;/a&gt; formula_1 (&lt;a href=\"subset\"&gt;subset&lt;/a&gt;s of a common set formula_2) is a set whose elements are determined by the sequence in either of two equivalent ways: (1) by upper and lower bounds on the sequence that converge monotonically to the same set (analogous to &lt;a href=\"Limit%20of%20a%20sequence\"&gt;convergence of real-valued sequences&lt;/a&gt;) and (2) by convergence of a sequence of &lt;a href=\"indicator%20function\"&gt;indicator function&lt;/a&gt;s which are themselves &lt;a href=\"Real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt;-valued. As is the case with sequences of other objects, convergence is not necessary or even usual.\nMore generally, again analogous to real-valued sequences, the less restrictive limit infimum and limit supremum of a set sequence always exist and can be used to determine convergence: the limit exists if the limit infimum and limit supremum are identical. (See below). Such set limits are essential in &lt;a href=\"Measure%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;measure theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"probability\"&gt;probability&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is a common misconception that the limits infimum and supremum described here involve sets of accumulation points, that is, sets of formula_3 where each formula_4 is in some formula_5 This is only true if convergence is determined by the &lt;a href=\"discrete%20metric\"&gt;discrete metric&lt;/a&gt; (that is, formula_6 if there is formula_7 such that formula_8 for all formula_9). This article is restricted to that situation as it is the only one relevant for measure theory and probability. See the examples below. (On the other hand, there are more general &lt;a href=\"Limit%20superior%20and%20limit%20inferior%23General%20set%20convergence\"&gt;topological notions of set convergence&lt;/a&gt; that do involve accumulation points under different &lt;a href=\"Metric%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;metrics&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Topological%20space\"&gt;topologies&lt;/a&gt;.)\nDefinitions.\nThe two definitions.\nSuppose that formula_10 is a sequence of sets. The two equivalent definitions are as follows.\nTo see the equivalence of the definitions, consider the limit infimum. The use of &lt;a href=\"De%20Morgan%27s%20law\"&gt;De Morgan's law&lt;/a&gt; below explains why this suffices for the limit supremum. Since indicator functions take only values formula_17 and formula_23 formula_24 if and only if formula_14 takes value formula_17 only finitely many times. Equivalently, \nformula_27 \nif and only if there exists formula_28 such that the element is in formula_29 for every formula_30 which is to say if and only if formula_31 for only finitely many formula_32 \nTherefore, formula_33 is in the formula_34 if and only if formula_33 is in all but finitely many formula_36 For this reason, a shorthand phrase for the limit infimum is \"formula_33 is in formula_13 all but finitely often\", typically expressed by writing \"formula_13 a.b.f.o.\".\nSimilarly, an element formula_33 is in the limit supremum if, no matter how large formula_28 is, there exists formula_42 such that the element is in formula_43 That is, formula_33 is in the limit supremum if and only if formula_33 is in infinitely many formula_36 For this reason, a shorthand phrase for the limit supremum is \"formula_33 is in formula_13 infinitely often\", typically expressed by writing \"formula_13 i.o.\".\nTo put it another way, the limit infimum consists of elements that \"eventually stay forever\" (are in set after formula_28), while the limit supremum consists of elements that \"never leave forever\" (are in set after formula_28). Or more formally:\nMonotone sequences.\nThe sequence formula_52 is said to be nonincreasing if formula_53 for each formula_54 and nondecreasing if formula_55 for each formula_32 In each of these cases the set limit exists. Consider, for example, a nonincreasing sequence formula_57 Then \nformula_58\nFrom these it follows that\nformula_59\nSimilarly, if formula_52 is nondecreasing then \nformula_61\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cantor%20set%23Construction%20and%20formula%20of%20the%20ternary%20set\"&gt;Cantor set&lt;/a&gt; is defined this way.\nProbability uses.\nSet limits, particularly the limit infimum and the limit supremum, are essential for &lt;a href=\"probability\"&gt;probability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Measure%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;measure theory&lt;/a&gt;. Such limits are used to calculate (or prove) the probabilities and measures of other, more purposeful, sets. For the following, formula_105 is a &lt;a href=\"probability%20space\"&gt;probability space&lt;/a&gt;, which means formula_79 is a &lt;a href=\"sigma-algebra\"&gt;\u03c3-algebra&lt;/a&gt; of subsets of formula_107 and formula_108 is a &lt;a href=\"probability%20measure\"&gt;probability measure&lt;/a&gt; defined on that \u03c3-algebra. Sets in the \u03c3-algebra are known as &lt;a href=\"Event%20%28probability%20theory%29\"&gt;events&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf formula_1 is a &lt;a href=\"Set-theoretic%20limit%23Monotone_sequences\"&gt;monotone sequence&lt;/a&gt; of events in formula_79 then formula_93 exists and\nformula_112\nBorel\u2013Cantelli lemmas.\nIn probability, the two &lt;a href=\"Borel%E2%80%93Cantelli%20lemma\"&gt;Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma&lt;/a&gt;s can be useful for showing that the limsup of a sequence of events has probability equal to 1 or to 0. The statement of the first (original) Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma is\nThe second Borel\u2013Cantelli lemma is a partial converse:\nAlmost sure convergence.\nOne of the most important applications to &lt;a href=\"probability\"&gt;probability&lt;/a&gt; is for demonstrating the &lt;a href=\"almost%20sure%20convergence\"&gt;almost sure convergence&lt;/a&gt; of a sequence of &lt;a href=\"random%20variable\"&gt;random variable&lt;/a&gt;s. The event that a sequence of random variables formula_113 converges to another random variable formula_114 is formally expressed as formula_115 It would be a mistake, however, to write this simply as a limsup of events. That is, this the event formula_116! Instead, the of the event is \nformula_117\nTherefore,\nformula_118"
