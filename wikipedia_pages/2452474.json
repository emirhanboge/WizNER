On November 20, 2007, he was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Anaheim%20Arsenal\"&gt;Anaheim Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"NBA%20Development%20League\"&gt;NBA Development League&lt;/a&gt;. He was recalled from the D-League on December 2, and he made his debut for the Magic on March 1, 2008 against the New York Knicks. On April 16, 2008, in the Magic's last game of the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20NBA%20season\"&gt;2007\u201308 season&lt;/a&gt;, little-used Gortat played 28 minutes and registered 12 points and 11 rebounds in a 103\u201383 Magic win over the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Wizards\"&gt;Washington Wizards&lt;/a&gt;. On December 15, 2008, starting in place of the injured &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20Howard\"&gt;Dwight Howard&lt;/a&gt;, Gortat played 28 minutes and recorded 16 points and 13 rebounds. On April 13, 2009, again starting in place of Howard, Gortat played almost 43 minutes and topped his career high in rebounding with 18 rebounds and had 10 points. On April 30, 2009, Gortat made his first playoff start in Game 6 against the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%2076ers\"&gt;Philadelphia 76ers&lt;/a&gt;, replacing Howard, who was suspended because of his actions in game 5. He had 11 points and 15 rebounds as the Magic eliminated the 76ers 4\u20132. That Magic playoff run continued all the way to the &lt;a href=\"NBA%20Finals\"&gt;NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt;, making Gortat the first Polish-born player to ever appear in the championship series.\nOn July 8, 2009, Gortat, a restricted free agent, signed an offer sheet for five years and $34 million with the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Mavericks\"&gt;Dallas Mavericks&lt;/a&gt;. However, Orlando prevented Gortat from going to Dallas by matching the offer sheet on July 13, 2009. Gortat was said to be \"very disappointed\" to stay with the Magic, since continuing as backup to Dwight Howard would mean limited playing time, whereas playing for Dallas would likely have meant being the starting center.\nPhoenix Suns (2010\u20132013).\nOn December 18, 2010, Gortat was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20Suns\"&gt;Phoenix Suns&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Vince%20Carter\"&gt;Vince Carter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Micka%C3%ABl%20Pi%C3%A9trus\"&gt;Micka\u00ebl Pi\u00e9trus&lt;/a&gt;, a 2011 first-round draft pick (which would become &lt;a href=\"Nikola%20Miroti%C4%87\"&gt;Nikola Miroti\u0107&lt;/a&gt;), and $3 million, in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Richardson\"&gt;Jason Richardson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Earl%20Clark\"&gt;Earl Clark&lt;/a&gt;, and then-former Magic player and former teammate &lt;a href=\"Hedo%20T%C3%BCrko%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu&lt;/a&gt;. Due to &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Nash\"&gt;Steve Nash&lt;/a&gt; wearing the #13 jersey, which was the number that Gortat had worn in Orlando and Poland, he decided to wear #4 for his tenure with the Suns. During his first season with the Suns, his numbers increased as his minutes grew, initially coming off the bench, then starting at center in place of &lt;a href=\"Robin%20Lopez\"&gt;Robin Lopez&lt;/a&gt;. During his time in Phoenix, Gortat continued to be known as \"The Polish Hammer\" a nickname originally given to him during his time with the Orlando Magic.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2011%20NBA%20lockout\"&gt;lockout-shortened&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20NBA%20season\"&gt;2011\u201312 season&lt;/a&gt;, Gortat averaged 15.4 points and 10.0 rebounds per game. He was the only Suns player to start and play every game of the regular season.

In the second game against &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, he scored 27 points and grabbed 21 rebounds to help Poland qualify for &lt;a href=\"Eurobasket%202013\"&gt;2013's FIBA Eurobasket tournament&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn November 7, 2012, he scored 23 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and had a career-best 7 blocks in a 117\u2013110 victory against the &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20Bobcats\"&gt;Charlotte Bobcats&lt;/a&gt;. In late February, Gortat suffered a knee injury, and was left off the team for the rest of the season.\nWashington Wizards (2013\u20132018).\nOn October 25, 2013, Gortat was traded, along with &lt;a href=\"Shannon%20Brown\"&gt;Shannon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Lee%20%28basketball%29\"&gt;Malcolm Lee&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kendall%20Marshall\"&gt;Kendall Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Wizards\"&gt;Washington Wizards&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Emeka%20Okafor\"&gt;Emeka Okafor&lt;/a&gt; and a 2014 protected first-round draft pick.\nOn February 27, 2014, Gortat recorded a career-high 31 points and 12 rebounds in a 134\u2013129 triple overtime win over the Toronto Raptors. On May 13, he recorded 31 points (his playoff career high) and 16 rebounds to help the Wizards avoid elimination in Game 5 of their second-round series with the Indiana Pacers. He became the first Wizards player with at least 30 points and 15 rebounds in a playoff game since &lt;a href=\"Moses%20Malone\"&gt;Moses Malone&lt;/a&gt; in 1987. The Wizards went on to lose Game 6 of the series, falling 4\u20132 to the Pacers.\nOn July 10, 2014, Gortat re-signed with the Wizards to a reported five-year, $60 million contract.\nOn December 28, 2015, Gortat was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played December 21\u201327, earning the honor for the first time in his career. On February 29, 2016, he scored 13 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter and grabbed a career-high 20 rebounds in the Wizards' 116\u2013108 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.\nLos Angeles Clippers (2018\u20132019).\nOn June 26, 2018, Gortat was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Clippers\"&gt;Los Angeles Clippers&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Rivers\"&gt;Austin Rivers&lt;/a&gt;.
