    "text": "Where's Huddles? is an American &lt;a href=\"adult%20animation\"&gt;adult animated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sitcom\"&gt;sitcom&lt;/a&gt; produced by &lt;a href=\"Hanna-Barbera\"&gt;Hanna-Barbera Productions&lt;/a&gt; that premiered on &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; on July 1, 1970 and ran for ten episodes as a summer replacement show for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Glen%20Campbell%20Goodtime%20Hour\"&gt;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&lt;/a&gt;\" until September 2.\nIt was similar in style to the studio's considerably more successful \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Flintstones\"&gt;The Flintstones&lt;/a&gt;\", and used several of the same essential voice actors and plots. Also, like \"The Flintstones\", \"Where's Huddles?\" aired in the evening during &lt;a href=\"prime%20time\"&gt;prime time&lt;/a&gt;, had a laugh track, and had somewhat adult themes. All ten episodes were produced and directed by &lt;a href=\"William%20Hanna\"&gt;William Hanna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Barbera\"&gt;Joseph Barbera&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe summer replacement was intended be a trial run for a full prime-time series, but only lasted for ten episodes. The episodes were repeated on the network's Sunday afternoon special in the summer of 1971.\nOverview.\nThe show's premise involved a professional football quarterback named Ed Huddles (voiced by &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Norton\"&gt;Cliff Norton&lt;/a&gt;) and his neighbor, the team's center Bubba McCoy (voiced by &lt;a href=\"Mel%20Blanc\"&gt;Mel Blanc&lt;/a&gt;). They played for a team called the Rhinos. Other characters included Ed's wife Marge Huddles (voiced by &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Vander%20Pyl\"&gt;Jean Vander Pyl&lt;/a&gt;), the Huddles' daughter Pom-Pom, and their &lt;a href=\"black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; teammate Freight Train (voiced by &lt;a href=\"Herb%20Jeffries\"&gt;Herb Jeffries&lt;/a&gt;). Bubba's wife Penny McCoy was played by comedic actress &lt;a href=\"Marie%20Wilson%20%28American%20actress%29\"&gt;Marie Wilson&lt;/a&gt; in her final role. The regular &lt;a href=\"foil%20%28literature%29\"&gt;foil&lt;/a&gt; was Claude Pertwee (&lt;a href=\"Paul%20Lynde\"&gt;Paul Lynde&lt;/a&gt;), who lived alone with his cat Beverley and could tolerate the wives, but considered the men to be \"savages\". His look and temperamental behavior are similar to Mr. Peevly from \"&lt;a href=\"Help%21...%20It%27s%20the%20Hair%20Bear%20Bunch\"&gt;Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Rhinos' football announcer was voiced by sportscaster &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Enberg\"&gt;Dick Enberg&lt;/a&gt;, who at the time was the voice of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Rams\"&gt;Los Angeles Rams&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Reed\"&gt;Alan Reed&lt;/a&gt; had a recurring role as Mad Dog Maloney, the Rhinos' coach. The Huddles had a dog named Fumbles, voiced by &lt;a href=\"Don%20Messick\"&gt;Don Messick&lt;/a&gt;. Fumbles, much like Muttley, would often laugh at someone's misfortune, but whereas Muttley's laugh was wheezy in nature, Fumbles' laugh was more guttural. Most of the in-game action consisted of recycled animation (a shot of the team's running back side-kicking and stiff-arming defenders was one shot that was particularly frequently used).\nPaul Lynde was credited for his role in this series as Claude Pertwee; this was unusual for Lynde, as he generally went uncredited in his other work for Hanna-Barbera at the time, which consisted mostly of &lt;a href=\"Saturday%20morning%20cartoon\"&gt;Saturday morning cartoon&lt;/a&gt;s (as opposed to \"Where's Huddles?\", which aired in &lt;a href=\"prime%20time\"&gt;prime time&lt;/a&gt;). In addition to the \"Huddles\" television series, there was also a comic book (with art by Roger Armstrong) which ran for three issues from &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Key%20Comics\"&gt;Gold Key/Whitman Comics&lt;/a&gt; in 1971.\nHome media.\nOn July 26, 2016, &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Archive%20Collection\"&gt;Warner Archive&lt;/a&gt; released \"Where's Huddles?: The Complete Series\" on &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; in region 1 as part of their &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20works%20produced%20by%20Hanna-Barbera%20Productions%23Hanna-Barbera%20Classics%20Collection\"&gt;Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection&lt;/a&gt;. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store.\nThe series will be available on &lt;a href=\"HBO%20Max\"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; in Fall 2021."
