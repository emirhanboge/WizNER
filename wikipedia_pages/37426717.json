His plantation on the &lt;a href=\"Perquimans%20River\"&gt;Perquimans River&lt;/a&gt; produced corn, cotton, wheat, flax, indigo, tobacco, rice, and wood products. It is the oldest house in North Carolina that is open to the public.\nThe house was added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1971."
