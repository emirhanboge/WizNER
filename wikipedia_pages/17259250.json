    "text": "The Sports Ground, Stompond Lane (also called Stompond Lane Sports Ground, but often just shortened to Stompond Lane) was a &lt;a href=\"stadium\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Walton-on-Thames\"&gt;Walton-on-Thames&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Surrey\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt;. It was where &lt;a href=\"Walton%20%26amp%3B%20Hersham%20F.C.\"&gt;Walton &amp; Hersham F.C.&lt;/a&gt; play their home matches and it was also used by the Walton Athletic Club.\nStructure.\nStompond Lane consisted of a football pitch surrounded by a running track. There was a brick &lt;a href=\"grandstand\"&gt;grandstand&lt;/a&gt; on the north side, which contained 404 regular seats and 40 in the two directors' boxes. The seats had to be accessed by stairways because the dressing rooms were beneath them. On the opposite side of the pitch was a covered terrace and there was uncovered terracing surrounding the east side of the track.\nClosure.\nOn 19 September 2017, Stompond Lane was used for the last time to host &lt;a href=\"Walton%20%26amp%3B%20Hersham%20F.C.\"&gt;Walton &amp; Hersham F.C.&lt;/a&gt;. After this game, the existing structures were demolished to make way for a development of 54 new houses, and Walton &amp; Hersham F.C relocated to the new &lt;a href=\"Elmbridge%20Sports%20Hub\"&gt;Elmbridge Sports Hub&lt;/a&gt; in Waterside Drive."
