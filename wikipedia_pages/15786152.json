    "text": "Michael Seifert (16 March 1924 \u2013 6 November 2010) was an &lt;a href=\"Schutzstaffel\"&gt;SS&lt;/a&gt; guard in &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was an ethnic German born in &lt;a href=\"Shyrokolanivka\"&gt;Landau&lt;/a&gt; (present-day &lt;a href=\"Mykolaiv%20Oblast\"&gt;Mykolaiv Oblast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;). Dubbed the \"Beast of Bolzano\", he was convicted \"&lt;a href=\"trial%20in%20absentia\"&gt;in absentia&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2000 by a &lt;a href=\"military%20tribunal\"&gt;military tribunal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Verona\"&gt;Verona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, on nine counts of &lt;a href=\"murder\"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt;, committed while he was an SS guard at the &lt;a href=\"Bolzano%20Transit%20Camp\"&gt;Bolzano Transit Camp&lt;/a&gt;, northern Italy.\nHe was sentenced to life in prison and &lt;a href=\"Extradition\"&gt;extradited&lt;/a&gt; on 17 February 2008, from &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; to Italy. His crimes involved actions taken in a prison camp in Bolzano from 1944 to 1945. At his trial, witnesses accused him of leaving a prisoner to starve to death, raping and killing a pregnant woman, and gouging an inmate's eyes out.\nAvi Benlolo, president of the Friends of &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Wiesenthal%20Center\"&gt;Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies&lt;/a&gt; in Canada, noted that Seifert's imprisonment \"sets an example for other &lt;a href=\"war%20criminal\"&gt;war criminal&lt;/a&gt;s, not only Nazi war criminals, but war criminals related to &lt;a href=\"Rwanda\"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosnia\"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darfur\"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;, or any other &lt;a href=\"genocide\"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;, that there's no time limit to &lt;a href=\"justice\"&gt;justice&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAfter his extradition to Italy from Canada, Seifert was held in an Italian &lt;a href=\"military%20prison\"&gt;military prison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Maria%20Capua%20Vetere\"&gt;Santa Maria Capua Vetere&lt;/a&gt;. Prosecutors from Italy and &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; intended to interview him regarding other war crimes that may have taken place at Bolzano.\nHe died in 2010 in Santa Maria after having been transferred to a hospital from the Capua Vetere prison. He was buried in a cemetery near Caserta after his body went unclaimed by friends and relatives. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20120319223535/http%3A//www.suedtirolnews.it/d/artikel/2011/03/27/bestie-von-bozen-in-caserta-begraben.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"
