In 1906, he was named engineer for the city of &lt;a href=\"Windsor%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt;. Hanes married Ella Douglas James in 1907. He moved to &lt;a href=\"North%20Vancouver%20%28city%29\"&gt;North Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; after being named city engineer in 1909, serving until 1912. From 1913 to 1916, he was mayor of North Vancouver.

In 1920, Hanes ran as an Independent but was endorsed by the North Vancouver City Liberal Association and the Great War Veterans Association; Benjamin Chubb, running as the Liberal candidate, was repudiated by the North Vancouver City Liberal Association. Hanes was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1924 as an Independent Liberal. In 1918, he served as a lieutenant in the Canadian Engineering Regiment of the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Canadian Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt;.
