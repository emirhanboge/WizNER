In his stay at Parma, he became one of the fan favourites, earning the nickname \"Il Sindaco\" (The Mayor) by the local supporters, and he was a key player for the team that climbed the Italian football divisions, up from &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C1\"&gt;Serie C1&lt;/a&gt; to the top division, &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;.
