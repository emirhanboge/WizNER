The club was established 11 May 1910 as \"Sportverein Allenstein\" as the successor to \"Fu\u00dfballklub 1907 Allenstein\".\nHistory.\n\"SV\" played in the regional top-flight Baltenverband in its first three years of existence before it slipped into lower level local play. In 1935 the club re-emerged in the Gauliga Allenstein, a sub-division of the regional first division &lt;a href=\"Gauliga%20Ostpreu%C3%9Fen\"&gt;Gauliga Ostpreu\u00dfen&lt;/a&gt;, as a middling side. \"SV\" remained qualified for play in the Gauliga when it was reorganized into a single division in 1939. The team played the 1939\u201340 season alongside \"&lt;a href=\"Viktoria%20Allenstein\"&gt;Viktoria Allenstein&lt;/a&gt;\" as the combined side \"Sportgemeinde Allenstein\".
