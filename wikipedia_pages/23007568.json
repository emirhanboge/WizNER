    "text": "Dar al-Islam is a &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; educational center located near &lt;a href=\"Abiqui%C3%BA%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Abiqui\u00fa, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, USA.\nHistory.\nIt was the first planned Islamic community in the United States. It was originally co-founded in 1979 by &lt;a href=\"Nooruddeen%20Durkee\"&gt;Nuridin Durkee&lt;/a&gt;, an American who had converted to Islam; Sahl Kabbani, a Saudi businessman; and &lt;a href=\"Abdullah%20Omar%20Nasseef\"&gt;Abdullah Omar Nasseef&lt;/a&gt;, a former secretary-general of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Muslim%20League\"&gt;World Muslim League&lt;/a&gt;. Kabbani reportedly contributed $125,000 to the non-profit &lt;a href=\"Lama%20Foundation\"&gt;Lama Foundation&lt;/a&gt; that was formed to create the community, while the bulk of the start up funds were said to have come from the Riyadh Ladies\u2019 Benevolent Association of Saudi Arabia, and several daughters of the late &lt;a href=\"Khalid%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Khalid bin Abdulaziz Al Saud&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe foundation purchased its first site from Alva Simpson, a well-established rancher along the Chama, for $1,372,000. The land included the mesa top, plus below the mesa \u2013 a lush, fertile tract along the Chama River.\nAt its height, the community served some 60 students, employed seven full-time teachers, and partially supported itself through resident entrepreneurial efforts. By 1990, however, the project was suffering from attrition. Although it never fully achieved its original intent as a residential community for American Muslims, it did succeed in remaining viable as an educational facility. Today it provides religious instruction, retreats and camps for its residents and other Muslims, as well as teaching workshops on Islam for public and private institutions.\nArchitecture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mosque\"&gt;mosque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"madrasa\"&gt;madrasa&lt;/a&gt; (religious school) were designed by the &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian architect &lt;a href=\"Hassan%20Fathy\"&gt;Hassan Fathy&lt;/a&gt; and were constructed of &lt;a href=\"adobe\"&gt;adobe&lt;/a&gt;. The main buildings were completed in 1981, and Dar al-Islam opened in 1982."
