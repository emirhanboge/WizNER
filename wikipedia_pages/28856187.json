    "text": "The Cape file snake (\"Limaformosa capensis\") is a &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of large, &lt;a href=\"venomous\"&gt;non-venomous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"snake\"&gt;snake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, belonging to the family &lt;a href=\"Lamprophiidae\"&gt;Lamprophiidae&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeographic range.\n\"L. capensis\" is found from &lt;a href=\"Natal%20%28region%29\"&gt;Natal&lt;/a&gt; northwards through the former &lt;a href=\"Transvaal%20Province\"&gt;Transvaal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;, and westwards to the &lt;a href=\"Caprivi%20Strip\"&gt;Caprivi Strip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Namibia\"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;, thence northwards to &lt;a href=\"Cameroon\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Somalia\"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"L. capensis\" is a medium to large snake. With an average total length (including tail) of about , specimens of total length have been recorded. It has a very flat head, and its body is strikingly triangular in cross-section.\nThe Cape file snake's &lt;a href=\"dorsal%20scales\"&gt;dorsal scales&lt;/a&gt; are strongly keeled with extensive pink-purple bare skin between the scales. Its colour is mostly grey to grey-brown, but occasionally dark olive to purple-brown. The prominent vertebral stripe is white to yellow, while the belly is ivory white to cream.\nThe dorsal scales, in addition to the strong primary keel, have secondary keels and tubercles, but no apical pits. The dorsal scales are arranged in 15 rows at midbody (in 17 rows on the neck). The &lt;a href=\"Ventral%20scales\"&gt;ventrals&lt;/a&gt; number 203-241. The &lt;a href=\"Anal%20scale\"&gt;anal plate&lt;/a&gt; is undivided. The &lt;a href=\"Subcaudal%20scales\"&gt;subcaudals&lt;/a&gt; number 45-61, and are divided (in two rows).\nHabitat.\n\"Limaformosa capensis\" prefers &lt;a href=\"savannah\"&gt;savannah&lt;/a&gt;s and coastal &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDiet.\nThough it is not venomous, the Cape file snake is a highly successful predator of other snakes, easily following a scent trail and apparently immune to all venom. It also preys on small &lt;a href=\"vertebrate\"&gt;vertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDefense.\nRarely attempting to bite when captured, \"L. capensis\" may defecate in self-defence.\nReproduction.\n\"L. capensis\" is &lt;a href=\"Oviparity\"&gt;oviparous&lt;/a&gt;. In the summer, an adult female may lay one or two clutches of eggs. Clutch size varies from 5-13. The eggs are large, 47\u201355\u00a0mm (about 2 inches) long, by 20\u201331\u00a0mm (about 1 inch) wide. Each hatchling is 39\u201342\u00a0cm (about 16 inches) in total length (including tail)."
