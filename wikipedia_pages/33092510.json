    "text": "Fumiaki Tanaka (\u7530\u4e2d \u53f2\u6717, born 3 January 1985 in &lt;a href=\"Kyoto\"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;) is a Japanese &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; footballer. He plays as a &lt;a href=\"Half-back%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;scrum-half&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Japan%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; on international level and for the &lt;a href=\"Panasonic%20Wild%20Knights\"&gt;Panasonic Wild Knights&lt;/a&gt; and the at domestic level.\nCareer.\nTanaka was not seen as one of the top prospects in Japan whilst at University, but after joining the &lt;a href=\"Panasonic%20Wild%20Knights\"&gt;Panasonic Wild Knights&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 he played alongside former All Blacks fly half &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Brown%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Tony Brown&lt;/a&gt; who was credited with helping him to develop immensely and Tanaka himself cites Brown as one of the most important influences on his career. After Tanaka's first season in the &lt;a href=\"Top%20League\"&gt;Top League&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Top%20League\"&gt;2007/08&lt;/a&gt;, he was named in the team of the season alongside Brown and also was named as newcomer of the year.\nAfter his first season in the &lt;a href=\"Top%20League\"&gt;Top League&lt;/a&gt;. Tanaka made his debut for against the &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20Gulf%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Arabian Gulf&lt;/a&gt; in May 2008 coming off the bench. He soon became a regular member of the Japan side and made the squad for the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2011 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; as first choice scrum half and is currently considered one of Japan's best and most important players. At domestic level, after being named in the Top League team of the season in his first year, he backed that up by being named in it again in &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Top%20League\"&gt;2008\u201309&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Top%20League\"&gt;2010\u201311&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter performing well at the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; despite it being a disappointing tournament for Japan, along with hooker &lt;a href=\"Shota%20Horie\"&gt;Shota Horie&lt;/a&gt; he was signed by &lt;a href=\"Otago%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Otago&lt;/a&gt; and reunited with &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Brown%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Tony Brown&lt;/a&gt;, his former teammate at the &lt;a href=\"Panasonic%20Wild%20Knights\"&gt;Panasonic Wild Knights&lt;/a&gt; who was now his coach. He won plaudits for his performances with &lt;a href=\"Otago%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Otago&lt;/a&gt; with his coach Brown calling him a \"world class player\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Herald\"&gt;New Zealand Herald&lt;/a&gt;\" noted him as one of the most exciting players in the &lt;a href=\"ITM%20Cup%202012\"&gt;ITM Cup&lt;/a&gt; and was regarded as a cult hero for Otago and seen as their standout player.\nFollowing his good performances with &lt;a href=\"Otago%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Otago&lt;/a&gt;, he became the first &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20people\"&gt;ethnic Japanese&lt;/a&gt; player to sign a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt; contract when he was named in the &lt;a href=\"Highlanders%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Highlanders&lt;/a&gt; squad for the 2013 season.\nAfter signing for the &lt;a href=\"Highlanders%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Highlanders&lt;/a&gt;, there was significant international media interest in him as the first Japanese player to play Super Rugby. He was said to have most interview requests out of anybody in the Highlanders team and attracted more attention than many of the World Cup winners in the squad. Japanese TV channels &lt;a href=\"NHK\"&gt;NHK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"WOWOW\"&gt;WOWOW&lt;/a&gt; did documentaries on his time in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, he also received a segment on &lt;a href=\"International%20Rugby%20Board\"&gt;IRB&lt;/a&gt; Total Rugby and even made the pages of the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAfter initially being limited to mainly to substitute appearances behind &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; scrum half &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Smith%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Aaron Smith&lt;/a&gt;, in Tanaka's second start in Super Rugby he was highly lauded for his performance against the &lt;a href=\"Blues%20%28Super%20Rugby%29\"&gt;Blues&lt;/a&gt; which even drew positive comments from the &lt;a href=\"International%20Rugby%20Board\"&gt;IRB&lt;/a&gt; CEO &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Gosper\"&gt;Brett Gosper&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn June 2013, Tanaka helped inspire Japan to their first ever win over where he continued his run of form and was praised as one of the game's outstanding performers.\nHe was also instrumental to the Japanese 32\u201334 victory over the Springboks in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, being selected Man of the Match.\nNotes.\nAt just 166\u00a0cm tall and weighing about 72\u00a0kg, Tanaka is one of the smallest professional rugby players in the world. He was the smallest player at the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2011 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and is understood to be the smallest player ever to have been involved in &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt;. Tanaka has commented that his size \"is an advantage\".\nTanaka has a tradition of shaving his head before the first game of the rugby season."
