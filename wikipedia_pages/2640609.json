    "text": "Aequorin is a &lt;a href=\"Calcium-binding%20protein\"&gt;calcium-activated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"photoprotein\"&gt;photoprotein&lt;/a&gt; isolated from the &lt;a href=\"hydrozoan\"&gt;hydrozoan&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Aequorea%20victoria\"&gt;Aequorea victoria&lt;/a&gt;\". Its &lt;a href=\"bioluminescence\"&gt;bioluminescence&lt;/a&gt; was studied decades before the protein was isolated from the animal by &lt;a href=\"Osamu%20Shimomura\"&gt;Osamu Shimomura&lt;/a&gt; in 1962. In the animal, the protein occurs together with the &lt;a href=\"green%20fluorescent%20protein\"&gt;green fluorescent protein&lt;/a&gt; to produce green light by &lt;a href=\"F%C3%B6rster%20resonance%20energy%20transfer%23BRET\"&gt;resonant energy transfer&lt;/a&gt;, while aequorin by itself generates blue light.\nDiscussions of \"jellyfish DNA\" that can make \"glowing\" animals often refer to &lt;a href=\"Genetically%20modified%20organism\"&gt;transgenic animals&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Transgenesis\"&gt;express&lt;/a&gt; the green fluorescent protein, not aequorin, although both originally derive from the same animal.\nApoaequorin, the protein portion of aequorin, is an ingredient in the &lt;a href=\"dietary%20supplement\"&gt;dietary supplement&lt;/a&gt; Prevagen. The US &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Trade%20Commission\"&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FTC) has charged the maker with &lt;a href=\"false%20advertising\"&gt;false advertising&lt;/a&gt; for its memory improvement claims.\nDiscovery.\nWork on aequorin began with &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Newton%20Harvey\"&gt;E. Newton Harvey&lt;/a&gt; in 1921. Though Harvey was unable to demonstrate a classical &lt;a href=\"luciferase\"&gt;luciferase&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"luciferin\"&gt;luciferin&lt;/a&gt; reaction, he showed that water could produce light from dried &lt;a href=\"photocytes\"&gt;photocytes&lt;/a&gt; and that light could be produced even in the absence of oxygen. Later, &lt;a href=\"Osamu%20Shimomura\"&gt;Osamu Shimomura&lt;/a&gt; began work into the &lt;a href=\"bioluminescence\"&gt;bioluminescence&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Aequorea\"&gt;Aequorea&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1961. This involved tedious harvesting of tens of thousands of jellyfish from the docks in &lt;a href=\"Friday%20Harbor%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Friday Harbor, Washington&lt;/a&gt;. It was determined that light could be produced from extracts with seawater, and more specifically, with &lt;a href=\"calcium\"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;. It was also noted during the extraction the animal creates green light due to the presence of the &lt;a href=\"green%20fluorescent%20protein\"&gt;green fluorescent protein&lt;/a&gt;, which changes the native blue light of aequorin to green.\nWhile the main focus of his work was on the bioluminescence, Shimomura and two others, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Chalfie\"&gt;Martin Chalfie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Tsien\"&gt;Roger Tsien&lt;/a&gt;, were awarded the &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 for their work on &lt;a href=\"green%20fluorescent%20protein\"&gt;green fluorescent protein&lt;/a&gt;s.\nStructure.\nAequorin is a &lt;a href=\"holoprotein\"&gt;holoprotein&lt;/a&gt; composed of two distinct units, the &lt;a href=\"Apoenzyme%23Coenzymes\"&gt;apoprotein&lt;/a&gt; that is called \"apoaequorin\", which has an approximate molecular weight of 21 &lt;a href=\"Atomic%20mass%20unit\"&gt;kDa&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"prosthetic%20group\"&gt;prosthetic group&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"coelenterazine\"&gt;coelenterazine&lt;/a&gt;, the luciferin. This is to say, apoaequorin is the &lt;a href=\"enzyme\"&gt;enzyme&lt;/a&gt; produced in the &lt;a href=\"photocyte\"&gt;photocyte&lt;/a&gt;s of the animal, and coelenterazine is the substrate whose oxidation the enzyme catalyzes. When coelenterazine is bound, it is called aequorin. Notably, the protein contains three &lt;a href=\"EF%20hand\"&gt;EF hand&lt;/a&gt; motifs that function as binding sites for Ca2+ ions. The protein is a member of the superfamily of the calcium-binding proteins, of which there are some 66 subfamilies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"crystal%20structure\"&gt;crystal structure&lt;/a&gt; revealed that aequorin binds coelenterazine and oxygen in the form of a &lt;a href=\"peroxide\"&gt;peroxide&lt;/a&gt;, coelenterazine-2-hydroperoxide. The binding site for the first two calcium atoms show a 20 times greater affinity for calcium than the third site. However, earlier claims that only two EF-hands bind calcium were questioned when later structures indicated that all three sites can indeed bind calcium. Thus, &lt;a href=\"titration\"&gt;titration&lt;/a&gt; studies show that all three calcium-binding sites are active but only two ions are needed to trigger the enzymatic reaction.\nOther studies have shown the presence of an internal &lt;a href=\"disulfide%20bond\"&gt;cysteine bond&lt;/a&gt; that maintains the structure of aequorin. This has also explained the need for a &lt;a href=\"thiol\"&gt;thiol&lt;/a&gt; reagent like &lt;a href=\"2-Mercaptoethanol\"&gt;beta mercaptoethanol&lt;/a&gt; in the regeneration of the protein since such reagents weaken the &lt;a href=\"sulfhydryl\"&gt;sulfhydryl&lt;/a&gt; bonds between &lt;a href=\"cysteine\"&gt;cysteine&lt;/a&gt; residues, expediting the regeneration of the aequorin.\nChemical characterization of aequorin indicates the protein is somewhat resilient to harsh treatments. Aequorin is heat resistant. Held at 95 \u00b0C for 2 minutes the protein lost only 25% activity. Denaturants such as 6-M urea or 4-M guanidine hydrochloride did not destroy the protein.\nGenetics.\nAequorin is presumably encoded in the &lt;a href=\"genome\"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt; of Aequorea. At least four copies of the gene were recovered as &lt;a href=\"Complementary%20DNA\"&gt;cDNA&lt;/a&gt; from the animal. Because the genome has not been sequenced, it is unclear if the cDNA variants can account for all of the isoforms of the protein.\nMechanism of action.\nEarly studies of the &lt;a href=\"bioluminescence\"&gt;bioluminescence&lt;/a&gt; of \"Aequorea\" by &lt;a href=\"E.%20Newton%20Harvey\"&gt;E. Newton Harvey&lt;/a&gt; had noted that the bioluminescence appears as a ring around the bell, and occurs even in the absence of air. This was remarkable because most bioluminescence reactions require &lt;a href=\"oxygen\"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, and led to the idea that the animals somehow store oxygen. It was later discovered that the apoprotein can stably bind coelenterazine-2-hydroperoxide, and oxygen is required for the regeneration to this active form of aequorin. However, in the presence of &lt;a href=\"calcium\"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; ions, the protein undergoes a conformational change and converts its prosthetic group, coelenterazine-2-hydroperoxide, into excited &lt;a href=\"coelenteramide\"&gt;coelenteramide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;CO2&lt;/a&gt;. As the excited coelenteramide relaxes to the ground state, blue light (&lt;a href=\"wavelength\"&gt;wavelength&lt;/a&gt; of 465\u00a0nm) is emitted. Before coelenteramide is exchanged out, the entire protein is still fluorescent blue. Because of the connection between &lt;a href=\"bioluminescence\"&gt;bioluminescence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fluorescence\"&gt;fluorescence&lt;/a&gt;, this property was ultimately important in the discovery of the luciferin &lt;a href=\"coelenterazine\"&gt;coelenterazine&lt;/a&gt;.\nApplications.\nSince the emitted light can be easily detected with a &lt;a href=\"luminometer\"&gt;luminometer&lt;/a&gt;, aequorin has become a useful tool in &lt;a href=\"molecular%20biology\"&gt;molecular biology&lt;/a&gt; for the measurement of intracellular Ca2+ levels. The early successful purification of aequorin led to the first experiments involving the injection of the protein into the tissues of living animals to visualize the physiological release of calcium in the muscle fibers of a barnacle. Since then, the protein has been widely used in many &lt;a href=\"Model%20organism\"&gt;model biological systems&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"zebrafish\"&gt;zebrafish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mice\"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cell%20culture\"&gt;cultured cells&lt;/a&gt;.\nCultured cells expressing the aequorin &lt;a href=\"gene\"&gt;gene&lt;/a&gt; can effectively synthesize apoaequorin; however, &lt;a href=\"Recombinant%20DNA\"&gt;recombinant&lt;/a&gt; expression yields only the &lt;a href=\"Apoenzyme%23Cofactors\"&gt;apoprotein&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore it is necessary to add &lt;a href=\"coelenterazine\"&gt;coelenterazine&lt;/a&gt; into the culture medium of the cells to obtain a functional protein and thus use its blue &lt;a href=\"light%20emission\"&gt;light emission&lt;/a&gt; to measure Ca2+ concentration. Coelenterazine is a hydrophobic molecule, and therefore is easily taken up across plant and fungal &lt;a href=\"cell%20walls\"&gt;cell walls&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"plasma%20membrane\"&gt;plasma membrane&lt;/a&gt; of higher eukaryotes, making aequorin suitable as a &lt;a href=\"calcium%20in%20biology\"&gt;Ca2+ reporter&lt;/a&gt; in plants, fungi, and mammalian cells.\nAequorin has a number of advantages over other Ca2+ indicators. Because the protein is large, it has a low leakage rate from cells compared to &lt;a href=\"Lipophilicity\"&gt;lipophilic&lt;/a&gt; dyes such as &lt;a href=\"DiI\"&gt;DiI&lt;/a&gt;. It lacks phenomena of intracellular compartmentalization or sequestration as is often seen for &lt;a href=\"Voltage-sensitive%20dye\"&gt;Voltage-sensitive dye&lt;/a&gt;s, and does not disrupt cell functions or embryo development. Moreover, the light emitted by the oxidation of coelenterazine does not depend on any optical excitation, so problems with auto-fluorescence are eliminated. The primary limitation of aequorin is that the prosthetic group coelenterazine is irreversibly consumed to produce light, and requires continuous addition of coelenterazine into the media. Such issues led to developments of other genetically encoded calcium sensors including the &lt;a href=\"calmodulin\"&gt;calmodulin&lt;/a&gt;-based sensor &lt;a href=\"cameleon%20%28protein%29\"&gt;cameleon&lt;/a&gt;, developed by &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Tsien\"&gt;Roger Tsien&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"troponin\"&gt;troponin&lt;/a&gt;-based sensor, \"TN-XXL\", developed by Oliver Griesbeck.\nMarketing &amp; Legal Challenges.\nApoaequorin is an ingredient in \"Prevagen\", which is marketed by Quincy Bioscience as a memory supplement. In 2017, the US &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Trade%20Commission\"&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FTC) charged the maker with &lt;a href=\"false%20advertising\"&gt;falsely advertising&lt;/a&gt; that the product improves memory, provides cognitive benefits, and is \"clinically shown\" to work. According to the FTC, \"the marketers of Prevagen preyed on the fears of older consumers experiencing &lt;a href=\"memory%20and%20aging\"&gt;age-related memory loss&lt;/a&gt;\". Quincy said that it would fight the charges.\nPrior to the suit, a clinical trial run by researchers employed by Quincy Bioscience \"found no overall benefit compared to a placebo for its primary endpoints involving memory and cognition\", while the company's advertising misleadingly cited a few contested &lt;a href=\"Subgroup%20analysis\"&gt;subgroup analyses&lt;/a&gt; that showed slight improvements.\nThe suit (\"Spath et al v. Quincy Bioscience Holding Company, Inc. et al.\", Case No. 18-cv-12416, D. NJ.) was dismissed in the District court, but an appeal seeking to overturn the dismissal was filed. The suit was consolidated with another against Quincy Pharmaceuticals, \"Vanderwerff v. Quincy Bioscience\" (Case No. 17-cv-784, D. NJ), which was the lead case.\nOn February 21, 2019, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Second%20Circuit\"&gt;United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit&lt;/a&gt; ruled that the FTC and the state of New York could proceed with their lawsuit against Quincy Bioscience for its claims that Prevagen can improve memory. The order came less than two weeks after the parties argued the case before a three-judge panel of the circuit, where company lawyers admitted they did not \"dispute that if you look across the entire 211 people who completed the study there was no statistically significant difference\". The court vigorously dismissed allegations by the company lawyers that the FTC pursued its action for political reasons.\nOn March 23, 2020, a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20magistrate%20judge\"&gt;federal magistrate judge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20Florida\"&gt;United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida&lt;/a&gt; entered a report and recommendations certifying a nationwide &lt;a href=\"class%20action\"&gt;class action&lt;/a&gt; for the class of consumers who purchased Prevagen over the previous four years. The trial in the case is set for October 2020. \nDr. &lt;a href=\"Harriet%20Hall\"&gt;Harriet Hall&lt;/a&gt;, writing for \"&lt;a href=\"Science-Based%20Medicine\"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;\", notes that the Quincy-sponsored study (known as \"Madison Memory Study\") was negative, but that the company utilized &lt;a href=\"p-hacking\"&gt;p-hacking&lt;/a&gt; to find favorable results. She notes that their cited safety studies are all rat studies and their claim that apoaequorin crosses the &lt;a href=\"blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier\"&gt;blood\u2013brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; is based solely on a dog study. The &lt;a href=\"American%20Pharmacists%20Association\"&gt;American Pharmacists Association&lt;/a&gt; warns that Apoaequorin \"is unlikely to be absorbed to a significant degree; instead it degrades into amino acids\"."
