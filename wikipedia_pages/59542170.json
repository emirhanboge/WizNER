    "text": "An association football trading card is a type of &lt;a href=\"trading%20card\"&gt;trading card&lt;/a&gt; relating to &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt;, usually printed on cardboard, silk, or plastic. These cards feature one or more players, clubs, stadiums, or trophies. Football cards are most often found in Europe, Asia and South America.\nSome notable producing companies include &lt;a href=\"Panini%20Group\"&gt;Panini Group&lt;/a&gt; (which has published cards of all &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=\"1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1970&lt;/a&gt; and has presence in more than 120 countries) and &lt;a href=\"Topps\"&gt;Topps&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;MLS&lt;/a&gt; and English &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;).\nHistory.\nEarly cards.\nAs earlier as 1887, John Baines started producing and selling die-cut football cards in the shape of shields of different football teams and featured generic players representing the teams.\nThe earliest documented cigarette football card appears to be issued from a cigarette brand called Field Favorites depicting Duncan MacLean of &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool F.C.&lt;/a&gt;. However, the earliest cigarette association football cards from a known set are &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Bassett\"&gt;Billy Bassett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Athersmith\"&gt;Charlie Athersmith&lt;/a&gt; from Godfrey and Phillips \u201cGeneral Interest\u201d in 1896. \nFootball cards were also produced circa 1896-1898 by the Marcus &amp; Company Tobacco in &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The set consisted of over 100 cards and was issued under the title of \"Footballers &amp; Club Colours\". They featured illustrated images of players on the front of the card, and a tobacco advertisement on the back of the card. The &lt;a href=\"tobacco%20company\"&gt;tobacco companies&lt;/a&gt; soon realised that sports cards were a great way to obtain brand loyalty. \nProduction of football cards spread over the United Kingdom. Other football sets issued at that time were released by other tobacco manufacturers such as Kinner (1898), Ogden's (1902), J.F. Bell (1902), F.J. Smith (1902), &lt;a href=\"W.D.%20%26amp%3B%20H.O.%20Wills\"&gt;W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills&lt;/a&gt; (1902), Percy E. Cadle (1904) and Singleton &amp; Cole.\nOne of the first full-colour sets was released in 1906 by Ogden's. The set of cards depicted illustrations of footballers in their club shirts. The set (properly named \"Football Club Colours\") featured clubs &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Newcastle United&lt;/a&gt;, Blackburn Rovers, &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, Cohen Weenen published a similar series entitled \"Football Club Captains\". This included captains of lower divisions teams of English football.\nTaddy &amp; Company introduced the oval-shaped images on its cards, with the collection \"Prominent Footballers\" of 1907 that consisted of 595 cards. Other cards manufacturers were &lt;a href=\"W.A.%20%26amp%3B%20A.C.%20Churchman\"&gt;Churchman's&lt;/a&gt; cigarettes, that in 1914 launched an illustrated series featuring action pictures with individual portraits as inserts, and &lt;a href=\"Godfrey%20Phillips%20India\"&gt;Godfrey Phillips Ltd.&lt;/a&gt; (a tobacco company from &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Crown%20colony\"&gt;British colony&lt;/a&gt; by then) and Lacey's.\nArgentina is probably the oldest producer of football cards in &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, when local tobacco company \"Cigarrillos Monterrey\" released a series about &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; teams. Cards showed full-colors illustrations of players in their club colours. Another popular series was released in 1925 by \"Cigarrillos D\u00f3lar\", with &lt;a href=\"hand-colouring%20of%20photographs\"&gt;hand-colored&lt;/a&gt; photographs of players and teams. In 1926, another cigarettes brand, \"Cigarrillos Plus Ultra\", released a set of cards featuring photos of teams and players.\nConsolidation.\nTaking advantage of the rise popularity of football cards in the 1920s, Godfrey Phillips released collections in 1920, 1922 and 1923. Lacey's also produce its own series of cards in 1925. Ogden's reintroduced the illustration in card with the \"Captains of Association Football Clubs and Colours\" series with &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s of players that &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;captained&lt;/a&gt; in their respective clubs. Following the trend, &lt;a href=\"John%20Player%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;John Player &amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Player's\"), produced three consecutive series of illustrated cards: the first in 1926 consisting in &lt;a href=\"caricature\"&gt;caricature&lt;/a&gt;s of notable players by R.P. Hill (signed as \"RIP\"), another with caricatures by &lt;a href=\"cartoonist\"&gt;cartoonist&lt;/a&gt; George Douglas Machin (signed as \"MAC\") in 1927, and the last in 1928 (with no artist credited).\nIn 1928, Gallaher published the \"Football in Action\" series, depicting illustrated scenes of matches in England. Another illustrated series by Player's came in 1934, \"Hints on association football\", it consisted of illustrations where some football movements (kicks, passes, defensive tactics, etc.) were shown. Gallaher released the series \"Footballers in Action\" in 1928. In 1930, Player's brought photograph to cards again with the series \"Cup Winners\", that homaged &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; winners teams of the past, although other companies continued printing illustrated cards in their new collections, such as Lambert &amp; Butler (1931) and Carreras (1934, 1936), Godfrey Phillips (1934, 1936), Ardath (1934), W.D. &amp; H. O. Wills (1935, 1939), Ogden's (two collections in 1935, the first featuring players of both sports, association football and &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt;, all illustrated by Machin). Photographs returned with Churchman in 1938 and 1939. The outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; caused a severe shortage of paper, and tobacco companies were forced to bring an end to the production of cigarette cards.\nIn the 1940s Argentine manufacturers introduced smaller, circular-shaped cards, such as \"Figuritas Bicicleta\" in 1949 that featured photos of footballers and illustrations of clubs' badges. Other companies that produced circular cards were \"Starosta\", \"Lali\" and \"Sport\" and \"Gran Crack\" in the 1950s, followed by \"Deportito\", \"Fulbito\", \"Golazo\" and \"Campe\u00f3n\" in the 1960s.\nIn 1967, \"Figuritas Sport\" collection introduced players' caricatures for the first time in Argentina. Those were drawn by artist Jorge de los R\u00edos (who was also the artist of children magazine \"Anteojito\" for the most part of its run). De los R\u00edos' depictions of players would become a classic in football cards during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The breakthrough in Argentine card industry came in 1970 when the first metallic circular cards began to be marketed in the \"Chapitas\" album. They were promoted as \"El golazo del a\u00f1o\" (\"Goal of the year\").\nModern era.\n&lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href=\"Panini%20Group\"&gt;Panini&lt;/a&gt; started to produce football cards in 1961, when the company released a collection set about &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, Panini has been producing football cards until consolidating as the world's leading manufacturer.\nIn 1970 Panini began publishing \"L'almanacco Illustrato del Calcio Italiano\" (The Illustrated Guide to Italian Football), after purchasing the rights from publishing house Carcano. Panini also published its first &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sticker%20album\"&gt;sticker album&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1970 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to using multilingual captions and selling stickers outside of Italy for the first time. Initiating a craze for collecting and trading stickers, Panini's stickers were an instant hit, with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" stating in the UK \"the tradition of swapping duplicate [World Cup] stickers was a playground fixture during the 1970s and 1980s\". Another first for Panini, in the early 1970s, was introducing self-adhesive stickers, as opposed to using glue.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, the first collection released by Panini was the &lt;a href=\"1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1974 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; album. The Spanish market introduced digital collections when Stampii, an &lt;a href=\"Dot-com%20company\"&gt;internet company&lt;/a&gt; established in 2009, released one year later its first set of digital trading cards. Collectors were allowed to acquire sets or share their collections only through the web.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Deck%20Company\"&gt;Upper Deck&lt;/a&gt; (established in 1988), released a series for the &lt;a href=\"1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; featuring several sports personalities that promoted the competition. The same company launched several collections after a deal with &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Soccer\"&gt;Major League Soccer&lt;/a&gt; (MLS) in the 2000s. Another US company, Pacific Trading Cards, produced &lt;a href=\"Major%20Indoor%20Soccer%20League%20%281978%E2%80%9392%29\"&gt;MISL&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"indoor%20soccer\"&gt;indoor soccer&lt;/a&gt; cards in the 1980s and 1990s. Moreover, &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Set%20trading%20cards\"&gt;Pro Set&lt;/a&gt; was licensor of the &lt;a href=\"English%20Premier%20League\"&gt;English Premier League&lt;/a&gt; for its football cards of 1990\u201391. &lt;a href=\"Wizards%20Of%20The%20Coast\"&gt;Wizards Of The Coast&lt;/a&gt; also had a brief stint producing Premier League players cards in 2001\u201302.\nAsian manufacturers include &lt;a href=\"Futera\"&gt;Futera&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"United%20Arab%20Emirates\"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; company established in 1989 that got licenses of some of the most notable English clubs.\nIn May 2006, Panini partnered with &lt;a href=\"The%20Coca-Cola%20Company\"&gt;The Coca-Cola Company&lt;/a&gt; and Tokenzone to produce the first virtual sticker album for the &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The album was viewable in at least 10 different languages, such as Portuguese, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Spanish. For the 2014 World Cup, three million FIFA.com users took part in the Panini Digital Sticker Album contest. Panini developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers. Five million people gathered digital stickers for the 2018 World Cup.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2018 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Panini produced an average of 8 and 10 million card packages per day. In 2018, Panini signed a deal with English &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; to produce cards under license since the 2019\u201320 season.\nManufacturing companies.\nPast.\nMost of the past producers companies are defunct of have left the trading card business, they were:\nCurrent.\nCompanies that currently produce football trading cards are:"
