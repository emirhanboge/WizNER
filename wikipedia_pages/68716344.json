    "text": "Frances Anna Hellebrandt (1901\u20131992) was an American physician and an expert on exercise physiology.\nLife.\nShe was born on August 26, 1901, in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1929, she received her BS in Physical Education and a medical degree from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison\"&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. Hellebrandt then earned several Anatomy and Physiology faculty positions at the university before she left the United States to study at the Clinic for Sportsmen at &lt;a href=\"Charles%20University\"&gt;Charles University&lt;/a&gt; from 1937\u20131938 in &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;, now the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic\"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the start of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, she opted to return to Wisconsin and specialize in physical rehabilitation. By 1943, she was chair of the university's physical therapy department.\nIn 1944, Hellebrandt agreed to head the newly created Baruch Center for Physical Medicine at the VCU &lt;a href=\"VCU%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Medical College of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. Because she brought many of her staffers with her, she was able to establish a new degree program in physical medicine, making the Center the \"first such facility in the South.\" She went on to make the Baruch Center the primary center for rehabilitation for all of Virginia.\nIn 1951, she returned to Chicago to become a professor and chair of physical medicine at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Illinois%20Urbana-Champaign\"&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, but her declining health forced her to retire, for the first time, in 1955. However, in 1957, after finding retirement unenjoyable, she took a position as a visiting lecturer and then became a professor at Wisconsin until her second retirement in 1964. At that time, she was named a professor emeritus by the university.\nHellebrandt was on the editorial board of the &lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Applied%20Physiology\"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;, and American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Along with Prof. L.E.A. Kelso, she created several research tools and devices still in use today. She served of the Board of Trustees for the &lt;a href=\"Easterseals%20%28U.S.%29\"&gt;Easter Seals&lt;/a&gt; Research Foundation, and received the Anderson Award from the American Association of Health, Physical Education and Recreation.\nHellebrandt died February 2, 1992 in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Arlington%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Upper Arlington&lt;/a&gt;, Ohio, at 90. Her remains were buried in &lt;a href=\"Bohemian%20National%20Cemetery%20%28Chicago%29\"&gt;Bohemian National Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, Chicago.\nWoman of achievement.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Centennial%20Congress\"&gt;Women's Centennial Congress&lt;/a&gt; organized by &lt;a href=\"Carrie%20Chapman%20Catt\"&gt;Carrie Chapman Catt&lt;/a&gt; was held in New York City in November 25\u201327, 1940, to celebrate a century of female progress. To demonstrate their advances, 100 \"successful women\" were invited to represent their respective fields of study in which they were working in 1940, but that would have been impossible for them in 1840. Hellebrandt's participation was listed in the science category with &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Mead\"&gt;Margaret Mead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Annie%20Jump%20Cannon\"&gt;Annie Jump Cannon&lt;/a&gt;, among others. The 100 women chosen were \"all American, alive and doing jobs that would have been impossible for a woman to undertake in 1840.\" In the program, Hellebrandt is mentioned as the \"inventor of [the] electric ergometer.\"\nLegacy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20tum%20Suden\"&gt;Caroline tum Suden&lt;/a&gt;/Frances A. Hellebrandt Professional Opportunity Awards, are given by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Physiological%20Society\"&gt;American Physiological Society&lt;/a&gt; to graduate students or post-doctoral fellows who are the first author of an abstract submitted to its Experimental Biology meeting.\nHellebrandt's papers are archived at &lt;a href=\"Virginia%20Commonwealth%20University\"&gt;Virginia Commonwealth University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt;.\nSelected works.\nShe authored more than 150 scientific papers."
