    "text": "Pepperdine University () is a &lt;a href=\"private%20university\"&gt;private&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"research%20university\"&gt;research university&lt;/a&gt; affiliated with &lt;a href=\"Churches%20of%20Christ\"&gt;Churches of Christ&lt;/a&gt; whose main campus is located near &lt;a href=\"Malibu%2C%20California\"&gt;Malibu, California&lt;/a&gt;. Founded by entrepreneur &lt;a href=\"George%20Pepperdine\"&gt;George Pepperdine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;South Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; in 1937, the school expanded to Malibu in 1972. Courses are now taught at a main Malibu campus, four graduate campuses in &lt;a href=\"Southern%20California\"&gt;Southern California&lt;/a&gt;, a center in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;, and international campuses in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, Argentina; &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, United Kingdom; &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg\"&gt;Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt;, Germany; &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, Italy; and &lt;a href=\"Lausanne\"&gt;Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;, Switzerland.\nThe university is composed of an undergraduate liberal arts school (Seaver College) and four graduate schools: the &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Caruso School of Law&lt;/a&gt;, the Graduate School of Education and Psychology, the &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20Graziadio%20Business%20School\"&gt;Graziadio Business School&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20School%20of%20Public%20Policy\"&gt;School of Public Policy&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nIn February 1937, against the backdrop of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Pepperdine\"&gt;George Pepperdine&lt;/a&gt; founded a liberal arts college in the city of Los Angeles to be affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Churches%20of%20Christ\"&gt;Churches of Christ&lt;/a&gt; and to be called\u2014to the founder's embarrassment\u2014George Pepperdine College. \nPepperdine had built his fortune largely through the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Auto\"&gt;Western Auto Supply Company&lt;/a&gt;, which he founded in 1909 with a $5 investment, but his prosperity led to his greater ambition to discover \"how humanity can be helped most with the means entrusted to [his] care. [He] considered it wrong to build up a great fortune and use it selfishly.\" Pepperdine voiced his twofold objective for the college that bore his name, \"First, we want to provide first-class, fully accredited academic training in the liberal arts\u00a0... Secondly, we are especially dedicated to a greater goal\u2014that of building in the student a Christ-like life, a love for the church, and a passion for the souls of mankind.\"\nOn September 21, 1937, 167 new students from 22 different states and two other countries entered classes on a newly built campus on at West 79th Street and South Vermont Avenue in the Vermont Knolls neighborhood of &lt;a href=\"South%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;South Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, later referred to as the Vermont Avenue campus. The campus was designed in the &lt;a href=\"Streamline%20Moderne\"&gt;Streamline Moderne&lt;/a&gt; style by John M. Cooper, an &lt;a href=\"art%20deco\"&gt;art deco&lt;/a&gt; architect. By April 5, 1938, George Pepperdine College was fully accredited by the Northwest Association in large part due to the leadership of president &lt;a href=\"Batsell%20Baxter\"&gt;Batsell Baxter&lt;/a&gt; and dean &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20M.%20Tiner\"&gt;Hugh M. Tiner&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe student newspaper, called the GraPhiC, published its first issue in October 1937.\nThe college expanded significantly in the years following its founding, reaching an enrollment of 1,839 for the 1948\u20131949 year. The college's first graduate program, a master of arts in religion, admitted its first students in 1944, and the school's first international program, a year-long program in &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg\"&gt;Heidelberg, Germany&lt;/a&gt;, was launched in 1963.\nRacial unrest, murder, and move to Malibu.\nBy 1957, when &lt;a href=\"M.%20Norvel%20Young\"&gt;M. Norvel Young&lt;/a&gt; was named president, the young college faced serious problems, not least of which was the high cost of expansion in South Los Angeles. The area around the Vermont Avenue campus was developing issues including rising crime and urban decay, and racial tensions had arisen that led to the 1965 &lt;a href=\"Watts%20Riots\"&gt;Watts Riots&lt;/a&gt;. \nBefore the worst of the tensions began, President Young began to look for suburban sites to expand the university's footprint. In 1966, a committee was formed to look at potential locations, including sites in &lt;a href=\"Westlake%20Village%2C%20California\"&gt;Westlake Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calabasas%2C%20California\"&gt;Calabasas&lt;/a&gt;. Pepperdine favored the Westlake Village location until the Adamson-Rindge family, who owned hundreds of acres near Malibu, offered to donate and to sell 58.7 adjacent acres. Despite concerns over building costs on the mountainous site, the school decided to move forward based on its prime location and potential for raising donations, accepting the land in Malibu in 1968. \nIn March 1969, Larry Kimmons, a Black teenager from the South LA neighborhood, was murdered by Pepperdine campus security officer Charlie Lane following a verbal argument. Protests ensued, with Black students opposing the university and White students fleeing the campus altogether. The killing was attributed to racism, and is said to have accelerated the move to Malibu, as a sort of &lt;a href=\"White%20flight\"&gt;White flight&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn December 1970, student activists threatened to burn down the campus, even setting small fires in three buildings. They later occupied the Academic Life building, leading to a standoff with the Los Angeles Police Department that was defused by negotiations with vice president &lt;a href=\"William%20S.%20Banowsky\"&gt;William S. Banowsky&lt;/a&gt;.\"bomb threats were made, buildings were destroyed, the National Guard surrounded the campus, random acts of vandalism were committed, and fighting between Blacks and Whites was reported\"Construction in Malibu began on April 13, 1971 and the new campus opened for student enrollment in September 1972. The campus and many of its buildings were planned by Los Angeles\u2013based architect and urban planner &lt;a href=\"William%20Pereira\"&gt;William Pereira&lt;/a&gt;, who had also designed the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Los Angeles County Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Irvine\"&gt;University of California, Irvine&lt;/a&gt;, and much of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20California\"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt;. The construction of the Malibu campus was made possible largely by gifts from &lt;a href=\"Blanche%20Seaver\"&gt;Blanche Seaver&lt;/a&gt;, the wife of &lt;a href=\"Frank%20R.%20Seaver\"&gt;Frank R. Seaver&lt;/a&gt; and heir of his oil-drill manufacturing fortune, who donated to Pepperdine more than $160 million over her lifetime. The undergraduate college was officially named after Seaver in 1975.\nThe university retained and continued to expand its original Vermont Avenue campus, building a new academic building there in 1970, and redesigning the curriculum to serve its more urban setting. Much of the undergraduate liberal arts program, however, moved to the new Malibu campus. In the decade to come, the Vermont Avenue campus transitioned away from its residential model, and in 1981 the Vermont Avenue campus was sold to &lt;a href=\"Crenshaw%20Christian%20Center\"&gt;Crenshaw Christian Center&lt;/a&gt;, whose minister, &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20K.%20C.%20Price\"&gt;Frederick K. C. Price&lt;/a&gt;, then oversaw construction of the \"Faith Dome,\" then the largest-domed church in the United States.\nGrowth of the university.\nJust as the university was looking for room to expand, it established several graduate schools. In 1969, Pepperdine bought the Orange University College of Law in &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Ana%2C%20California\"&gt;Santa Ana, California&lt;/a&gt;, which became the &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;School of Law&lt;/a&gt; and moved to the Malibu campus in 1978. What had been a business division offering graduate and undergraduate degrees became a graduate business school in 1968, which in 1971 was named the School of Business and Management. Also in 1971, the School of Education was formed, which in 1981 became the Graduate School of Education and Psychology. Pepperdine administrators used these expansions as justification to change the institution's name to Pepperdine University in 1971.\nPepperdine continued to expand, adding permanent international programs in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt; beginning in 1984 and 1985, respectively. These were followed by similar programs in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lausanne\"&gt;Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;. The School of Business and Management was renamed the &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20Graziadio%20Business%20School\"&gt;Graziadio Business School&lt;/a&gt; to honor a gift of $15 million from real estate developer &lt;a href=\"George%20L.%20Graziadio%20Jr.\"&gt;George L. Graziadio Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2019 the School of Law was renamed the &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Caruso School of Law&lt;/a&gt; after a pledge of $50 million from alumnus &lt;a href=\"Rick%20Caruso\"&gt;Rick J. Caruso&lt;/a&gt;. The Malibu campus itself was expanded by the construction of the Drescher Graduate Campus, which was completed in 2003 under the supervision of president &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20K.%20Benton\"&gt;Andrew K. Benton&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrushfires.\nPepperdine's Malibu campus has often been threatened by brushfires, including in 1985, 1993, 1996, &lt;a href=\"Canyon%20Fire%20%282007%29\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corral%20Fire\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Woolsey%20Fire\"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;. The university prepares for the fires by clearing brush 200 feet from all buildings and has developed plans with &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County%20Fire%20Department\"&gt;Los Angeles County Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; to shelter faculty, staff, and students in place.\nCampus.\nMalibu campus.\nPepperdine's Malibu campus is situated on of the &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Monica%20Mountains\"&gt;Santa Monica Mountains&lt;/a&gt; overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20Highway%20%28US%29\"&gt;Pacific Coast Highway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Malibu%2C%20California\"&gt;Malibu, California&lt;/a&gt;. It is widely considered one of the most beautiful college campuses in the world in terms of scenery and architecture, and has been described as \"a place that looks more like a beach resort than a private university.\" The campus offers views of the &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Monica%20Bay\"&gt;Santa Monica Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Catalina%20Island%2C%20California\"&gt;Catalina Island&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Palos%20Verdes%20Peninsula\"&gt;Palos Verdes Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, and much of the &lt;a href=\"Westside%20%28Los%20Angeles%20County%29\"&gt;westside of Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. Most buildings are designed in the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Revival%20Style%20architecture\"&gt;Mediterranean Revival Style&lt;/a&gt; with white stucco walls, red tile roofs, and large tinted windows. The first round of construction on the site was completed in 1973.\nThe most distinctive feature of the Malibu campus, apart from its location, is the Phillips Theme Tower, a 125-foot obelisk with an embedded cross that stands on the front lawn. The tower was designed by William Pereira in 1972, and construction was completed in 1973. The tower was dedicated in 1974 as a symbol of Pepperdine's dedication to its Christian mission. Following disputes with Malibu residents over the lighting of the cross, the tower has not been illuminated since 1980.\n&lt;a href=\"Alumni%20Park%20%28Pepperdine%29\"&gt;Alumni Park&lt;/a&gt; is located on the lowest part of the Malibu campus, adjacent to the Pacific Coast Highway. It is a 30-acre expanse of lawns, trails, hills, ponds and &lt;a href=\"Erythrina%20caffra\"&gt;coral trees&lt;/a&gt; overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Landscape architects Eric Armstrong and S. Lee Scharfman were responsible for the campus green space planning and design. The park was dedicated in 1979, and it now serves as the location for the university's commencement exercises and other campus activities that need a large open space. Overlooking Alumni Park is Stauffer Chapel, with its 3,000 square feet of stained-glass windows designed by Robert and Bette Donovan and constructed in 1973.\nThe main academic plaza for the undergraduate programs of Seaver College lies on a knoll above Alumni Park and includes Tyler Campus Center, &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20University%20Libraries\"&gt;Payson Library&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20R.%20Weisman%20Museum%20of%20Art%2C%20California\"&gt;Weisman Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. Undergraduate housing and athletic facilities sit to the northwest of the academic complex. The &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Caruso School of Law&lt;/a&gt; is situated on a hill above these areas. Banowsky Boulevard separates Alumni Park from the main academic complex and is named in honor of &lt;a href=\"William%20S.%20Banowsky\"&gt;William S. Banowsky&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth president of Pepperdine. Spur roads to the east lead to faculty housing.\nThe Drescher Graduate Campus is contiguous with and northwest of the central campus. Construction was completed in 2003, and it is now home to the &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20University%20School%20of%20Public%20Policy\"&gt;School of Public Policy&lt;/a&gt;, the Villa Graziadio Executive Center, and the full-time programs of the &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20Graziadio%20Business%20School\"&gt;Graziadio Business School&lt;/a&gt; and the Graduate School of Education and Psychology, as well as housing for students and faculty.\nGraduate campuses.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20Graziadio%20Business%20School\"&gt;Graziadio Business School&lt;/a&gt; and the Graduate School of Education and Psychology are headquartered in &lt;a href=\"West%20Los%20Angeles%20%28region%29\"&gt;West Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; at the Howard Hughes Center next to &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20405%20%28California%29\"&gt;Interstate 405&lt;/a&gt;. These two schools also offer programs at graduate campuses in &lt;a href=\"West%20Los%20Angeles%20%28region%29\"&gt;West Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Encino%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California\"&gt;Encino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Irvine%2C%20California\"&gt;Irvine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Calabasas%2C%20California\"&gt;Calabasas&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational campuses.\nPepperdine owns and operates permanent satellite campuses in five countries, with each campus offering semester- and year-long programs for students of Seaver College. The first such program was opened in 1963 in &lt;a href=\"Heidelberg\"&gt;Heidelberg&lt;/a&gt;. Programs were then introduced in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Kensington\"&gt;South Kensington&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; in 1984 and in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt; in 1985. Since then, programs have been launched in &lt;a href=\"Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lausanne\"&gt;Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, Seaver College announced the permanent closure of its Shanghai campus due to \u201coperational difficulties and decreased enrollment.\u201d The &lt;a href=\"Pepperdine%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Caruso School of Law&lt;/a&gt; also offers regular programs at the campus in London.\nIn addition to these regular offerings, international programs of the university's various schools have also taken place in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madrid\"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg\"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tegucigalpa\"&gt;Tegucigalpa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brisbane\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20Mai%2C%20Thailand\"&gt;Chiang Mai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcademics.\nFrank R.
