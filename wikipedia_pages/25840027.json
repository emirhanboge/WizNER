Most of the rain is received in the period from June to November, mainly through South-west Monsoon. This suits paddy cultivation and is adequate for the growth of vegetation during the entire year. December to May is the dry months with very little rainfall which helps in Salt production. The \"Naranapur\" gazani is one of the famous gazani (&lt;a href=\"Muscogee%20%28Creek%29\"&gt;Creek&lt;/a&gt; land) for salt production."
