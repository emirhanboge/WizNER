    "text": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Cuba may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Attitudes and acceptance towards &lt;a href=\"LGBT\"&gt;LGBT&lt;/a&gt; people have changed in recent years to be more tolerant. In 2018, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20of%20People%27s%20Power\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; voted to legalize &lt;a href=\"same-sex%20marriage\"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;, with a constitutional referendum to be held in February 2019. However, it was later removed from the draft Constitution. In May 2019, the Government announced that the Union of Jurists of Cuba is working on the new Family Code, which would address same-sex marriage. On 7 September 2021, the government announced that the new Family Code will be brought to the National Assembly for approval, and then be put to popular vote; this code will most likely legalize same-sex marriage if approved in the referendum. Discrimination on the basis of &lt;a href=\"sexual%20orientation\"&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gender%20identity\"&gt;gender identity&lt;/a&gt; is illegal in Cuba.\nHistorically, public antipathy towards LGBT people was high. This had eased since the 1990s. Educational campaigns on LGBT issues are currently implemented by the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20National%20Center%20for%20Sex%20Education\"&gt;National Center for Sex Education&lt;/a&gt; (locally known as \"CENESEX\"), headed by &lt;a href=\"Mariela%20Castro\"&gt;Mariela Castro&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of former President and &lt;a href=\"First%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20Cuba\"&gt;Communist Party First Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ra%C3%BAl%20Castro\"&gt;Ra\u00fal Castro&lt;/a&gt;. Pride parades in &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt; were held every May, to coincide with the International Day Against Homophobia, with attendance having grown every year.\nHistory.\nPre-revolution Cuba.\nIn pre-revolution Cuba, there were a few LGBT-friendly bars in Cuban cities, such as the St. Michel, the Intermezzo Bar, the Dirty Dick, and El Gato Tuerto in Havana. But Cuba had strict laws that criminalized &lt;a href=\"homosexuality\"&gt;homosexuality&lt;/a&gt; and targeted &lt;a href=\"gay%20men\"&gt;gay men&lt;/a&gt; for harassment. Socially, gay men were considered outcasts.\n[D]iscrete lesbian or gay male identities in the modern sense - identities that are based on self-definition and involve emotional as well as physical aspects of same-sex relations - were rare. Erotic loyalty (and, in the case of women, subservience) to the opposite sex was assumed to be normal even by homosexuals. Hence, for many Cubans of this era, homosexuality was a mere addendum to customary marital roles. Among others, it was just a profitable commodification of sexual fantasy. For the vast majority, homosexuality made life a shameful and guilt-ridden experience.\nHomosexuality was a component of the thriving industry of &lt;a href=\"prostitution%20in%20Cuba\"&gt;prostitution in Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, with many gay men drawn into prostitution largely for visitors and servicemen from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Homosexuality also was linked to gambling and crime.\nPost-revolution Cuba.\nHomophobia and labor camps during the 1960s.\nWith the profit motive eradicated by the revolution, the superficial tolerance of LGBT persons by the strongly homophobic Cuban society quickly evaporated. Emigration to &lt;a href=\"Miami\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; began immediately, including lesbians and gay men who had worked for United States firms or had done domestic work for the native bourgeoisie. LGBT people who already had lived largely abroad moved away permanently.\n[T]he homophobia and heterosexism that already existed ... became more systematized and institutionalized. Gender and sexuality explicitly entered political discourse even as vaguely worded laws increasingly targeted gender-transgressive men who were believed to be homosexual ... whereas &lt;a href=\"lesbianism\"&gt;lesbianism&lt;/a&gt; remained unnamed and invisible. Between 1959 and 1980[,] male homosexuals suffered a range of consequences from limited career options to detention in street sweeps to incarceration in labor camps. ... Long hair, tight pants, colorful shirts, so-called effeminate mannerisms, \"inappropriate clothing,\" and \"extravagant hairstyles\" were seen as visible markers of male homosexuality. Such visible markers not only facilitated enforcement of homosexual repression; more broadly, visibility and gender transgressions themselves constituted a central part of the problem identified by the revolution. Even during the severest period of enforcement, &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Leiner\"&gt;Marvin Leiner&lt;/a&gt; reminds us, private homosexual expression was never the main target. Rather, \"... the major concern, as it had always been, was with the public display of homosexuality.\"\nMany of the progressive LGBT persons who remained in Cuba became involved in counter-revolutionary activities, independently or through encouragement of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; (CIA), and were jailed. The 1961 &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Pigs%20invasion\"&gt;Bay of Pigs invasion&lt;/a&gt;, commando attacks from Florida bases, and internal CIA-sponsored subversion created in Cuba an increased concern over national security. Realistic fears gave rise to paranoia, and anyone who was \"different\" fell under suspicion. Homosexual bars and La Rampa cruising areas were perceived as centers of counter-revolutionary activities and they began to be systematically treated as such. The gay community was seen as a threat to the military order.\nCuba's new ally, the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, had hostile policies towards gays and lesbians, seeing homosexuality as a product of the decadent capitalist society prevailing in Cuba in the 1950s. &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Castro\"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; made insulting comments about homosexuality. Castro's admiring description of rural life in Cuba (\"in the country, there are no homosexuals\") reflected the idea of homosexuality as bourgeois decadence, and he denounced \"maricones\" as \"agents of imperialism\". Castro explained his reasoning in a 1965 interview:\n[W]e would never come to believe that a homosexual could embody the conditions and requirements of conduct that would enable us to consider him a true Revolutionary, a true Communist militant. A deviation of that nature clashes with the concept we have of what a militant Communist must be.\nAccording to Ian Lumsden, traditional Spanish &lt;a href=\"machismo\"&gt;machismo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; have disdained effeminate and sexually passive males for centuries. The &lt;a href=\"homophobia\"&gt;homophobia&lt;/a&gt; exposed during the revolution was a mere continuation of the well-established culture of machismo and the rigid gender roles of pre-revolutionary Cuba. &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Weinstein%20%28historian%29\"&gt;Barbara Weinstein&lt;/a&gt;, professor of Latin American history at &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20University\"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt; and co-editor of the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Hispanic%20American%20Historical%20Review\"&gt;Hispanic American Historical Review&lt;/a&gt;\", said that gay people were defined as deviant and decadent but not weak or sick. She also claimed that the way that the Cuban revolution came to power gave it a stronger sense of masculinity than other revolutions. The guerrilla experience pervaded the political structure and the guerrilla army itself became the nucleus of a new society.\nCuban gay writer &lt;a href=\"Reinaldo%20Arenas\"&gt;Reinaldo Arenas&lt;/a&gt; wrote, \"[T]he decade of the sixties ... was precisely when all the new laws against homosexuals came into being, when the persecution started and concentration camps were opened, when the sexual act became taboo while the 'new man' was being proclaimed and masculinity was being exalted.\" LGBT persons were imprisoned frequently, particularly effeminate males, without charge or trial, and confined to forced &lt;a href=\"labor%20camp\"&gt;labor camp&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCamps of forced labour were instituted with all speed to \"correct\" such deviations ... Verbal and physical mistreatment, shaved heads, work from dawn to dusk, hammocks, dirt floors, scarce food ... The camps became increasingly crowded as the methods of arrest became more expedient ...\nIn 1965, the country-wide &lt;a href=\"Military%20Units%20to%20Aid%20Production\"&gt;Military Units to Aid Production&lt;/a&gt; (; UMAP) program, located in the &lt;a href=\"Camag%C3%BCey%20Province\"&gt;Camag\u00fcey Province&lt;/a&gt;, was set up as an alternative form of military service for members of &lt;a href=\"Pacifism\"&gt;pacifist&lt;/a&gt; religious groups, such as &lt;a href=\"Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses\"&gt;Jehovah's Witnesses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hippie\"&gt;hippie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"conscientious%20objector\"&gt;conscientious objector&lt;/a&gt;s, and gay men. It was believed that the work, together with the strict regimes operating within the UMAP camps, would \"rehabilitate\" the participants. The camps became notorious both inside and outside Cuba. Although the camps ended up targeting gay men more than most, \"there is no evidence that [they] were created with homosexuals exclusively in mind.\" There is a debate whether or not these camps were labor or concentration camps. That being said, these camps were notorious for holding prisoners for up to three years without a charge.\nA homosexual man who worked in a UMAP camp described the conditions there as follows, \"[W]ork is hard because it's nearly always in the sun. We work 11 hours a day (cutting marble in a quarry) from seven in the morning to seven at night, with one hour's lunch break.\" In 1968, the camps closed. Castro said, \"They weren't units of internment or punishment... However, after a visit I discovered the distortion in some places, of the original idea, because you can't deny that there were prejudices against homosexuals. I personally started a review of this matter. Those units only lasted three years.\"\nMany gay artists and intellectuals like &lt;a href=\"Reinaldo%20Arenas\"&gt;Reinaldo Arenas&lt;/a&gt; were attracted to the socialist promise of an egalitarian society, which would pave the way for cultural and sexual freedom and social justice. Gay writers largely wrote the popular journal \"Lunes de Revoluci\u00f3n\". Its radical ideas seemed to enjoy the favor of the Cuban Government. But a couple of years after Castro's rise to power, this journal was closed down amidst a wave of media censorship. Its gay writers were publicly disgraced, refused publication, and dismissed from their jobs. Some were reassigned to work as janitors and labourers.\nThis period was dramatically documented in the 1980s documentary \"&lt;a href=\"Improper%20Conduct\"&gt;Improper Conduct&lt;/a&gt;\", by Reinaldo Arenas in his 1992 autobiography, \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20Night%20Falls\"&gt;Before Night Falls&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as in his fiction, most notably \"The Color of Summer\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Farewell%20to%20the%20Sea\"&gt;Farewell to the Sea&lt;/a&gt;\".\nNegative attitudes during most of the 1970s.\nHomophobia in Cuba persisted in the 1970s, with more tolerant attitudes beginning to appear in the mid-1970s.\nAlthough the UMAP program ended in 1968, the camps themselves continued. They became military units, and the same types of men were sent there as were sent to the UMAP camps. The only difference was that the men were paid a salary for their long and harsh working hours while living under very difficult and inhumane conditions. A 1984 documentary, \"&lt;a href=\"Improper%20Conduct\"&gt;Improper Conduct&lt;/a&gt;\", interviewed several men who had been sent to these camps. In his autobiography, \"My Life\", &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Castro\"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; claims the internment camps were used in lieu of the mistreatment homosexuals were receiving in the military during the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20intervention%20in%20Angola\"&gt;Cuban intervention in Angola&lt;/a&gt; and other conflicts. They would do laborious tasks and be housed roughly, but some saw it as better than joining the Cuban military because there, they would often be publicly humiliated and discharged by homophobic elements.\nAfter a discussion of homosexuality at the Cuban Educational and Cultural Congress in April 1971, homosexuality was declared to be a deviation incompatible with the revolution. Homosexuality was considered sufficient grounds for discriminatory measures to be adopted against the gay community, and homophobia was institutionalized. Gay and lesbian artists, teachers, and actors lost their jobs. Gays and lesbians were expelled from the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Cuba\"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;. Students were expelled from university. Gays were prohibited from having contact with children and young people. Gays were not allowed to represent their country.\nEffeminate boys were forced to undergo &lt;a href=\"aversion%20therapy\"&gt;aversion therapy&lt;/a&gt;.\nA more tolerant policy slowly began to emerge in 1975.\nIn 1975, the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Cuba\"&gt;People's Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; found in favor of a group of marginalised gay artists who were claiming compensation and reinstatement in their place of work. The court's ruling was the initial change in official attitudes towards gays and lesbians. In the same year, a new Ministry of Culture was formed under the leadership of Armando Hart D\u00e1valos, resulting in a more liberal cultural policy. In addition, a commission was established to investigate homosexuality, leading to the decriminalization of private, adult, non-commercial and consensual same-sex relationships in 1979.\nGradual liberalization during the 1980s.\nCuban gays took the opportunity to leave Cuba during the 1980 &lt;a href=\"Mariel%20boatlift\"&gt;Mariel boatlift&lt;/a&gt;. From the early stages of the massive exodus, the Government described homosexuals as part of the \"scum\" that needed to be discarded so the socialist society could be purified. Some homosexuals were given the ultimatum of either imprisonment (or extended terms for those already imprisoned) or leaving the country, although &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Castro\"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; publicly denied that anyone was being forced to leave.\nIn 1981, the Ministry of Culture stated in a publication entitled \"In Defence of Love\" that homosexuality was a variant of human sexuality. The ministry argued that homophobic bigotry was an unacceptable attitude inherited by the revolution and that all sanctions against gays should be opposed.\nIn 1986, the National Commission on Sex Education publicly opined that homosexuality was a sexual orientation and that homophobia should be countered by education. Gay author Ian Lumsden has claimed that since 1986 there is \"little evidence to support the contention that the persecution of homosexuals remains a matter of state policy\".\nIn 1988, the Government repealed the \"Public Ostentation Law of 1938\" () and the police received orders not to harass LGBT people. In a 1988 interview with Galician television, Castro criticized the rigid attitudes that had prevailed towards homosexuality.\nToward the end of the 1980s, literature with gay subject matter began to re-emerge.\nMore rapid liberalization since 1990.\nIn a 1993 interview with a former Nicaraguan government official, &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A1s%20Borge\"&gt;Tom\u00e1s Borge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Castro\"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; declared that he opposed policies against LGBT people as he considered homosexuality to be a natural tendency that should be respected. The same year, a series of sex education workshops were run throughout the country carrying the message that homophobia was a prejudice. That same year, the Government lifted its ban on allowing LGBT persons from serving openly in the military. Since 1993, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons may serve openly in the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20Revolutionary%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. However, discrimination is still common in the Cuban military so LGBT people serving tend to hide their sexual orientation.\nIn 1994, the feature film \"&lt;a href=\"Strawberry%20and%20Chocolate\"&gt;Strawberry and Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;\", produced by the government-run &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20Cuba\"&gt;Cinema of Cuba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A1s%20Guti%C3%A9rrez%20Alea\"&gt;Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea&lt;/a&gt;, featured a gay main character. The film criticized the country's narrow, doctrinaire ways of thinking in the 1970s and discussed anti-gay prejudice and the unjust treatment suffered by gays. The film provoked a great deal of comment and discussion among the public.\nIn 1995, Cuban &lt;a href=\"drag%20queens\"&gt;drag queens&lt;/a&gt; led the annual &lt;a href=\"May%20Day\"&gt;May Day&lt;/a&gt; procession, joined by two gay delegations from the United States. In the same year, Fidel Castro recanted his previous anti-LGBT sentiment, saying: \"I am absolutely opposed to all forms of oppression, contempt, scorn, or discrimination with regard to homosexuals\".\nAccording to a &lt;a href=\"Human%20Rights%20Watch\"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; report, \"the government [in 1997] ... heightened harassment of homosexuals, raiding several nightclubs known to have gay clientele and allegedly beating and detaining dozens of patrons.\" Spanish filmmaker &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Almod%C3%B3var\"&gt;Pedro Almod\u00f3var&lt;/a&gt; was reported to be among several hundred people detained in a raid on Havana's most popular gay discoth\u00e8que, \"El Periquiton\". According to a United States government report, Cuban customers of the club were fined and warned of imprisonment if they did not stop publicly displaying their homosexuality. The foreigners who were detained were released after a check of their documents. Many of the Cuban gay and lesbian clientele were reportedly beaten by police. This crackdown extended to other known gay meeting places throughout the capital, such as \"Mi Cayito\", a beach east of Havana, where gays were arrested, fined, or threatened with imprisonment.\nAfter this crackdown, Cuban gays and lesbians began keeping a lower profile amid intermittent sweeps of gay and lesbian meeting places. Castro's apparent criticism of Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea and his last film \"&lt;a href=\"Guantanamera%20%28film%29\"&gt;Guantanamera&lt;/a&gt;\" during a speech in February 1998 seemed to cast a further chill over Cuba's gay community. Still, a number of clandestine gay clubs continued to operate sporadically in private homes.\nIn December 2000, half of all the Latin American films shown at the &lt;a href=\"Havana%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Havana Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; had gay themes. Gay and lesbian film festivals are now run in a number of Cuban cities, and in October 2005, a Sexual Diversity Cinema Week was held in &lt;a href=\"Pinar%20del%20R%C3%ADo\"&gt;Pinar del R\u00edo&lt;/a&gt;.\nYet, in 2001, the police operated a campaign against gay and trans people, and prevented them from meeting in the street, fined them and closed down meeting places.\nIn 2004, the &lt;a href=\"soap%20opera\"&gt;soap opera&lt;/a&gt; \"El jard\u00edn de los helechos\" (\"Garden of Ferns\") included a lesbian couple as part of its plot. That same year, however, the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reported that \"Cuban police have once again launched a campaign against homosexuals, specifically directed at \"travestis\" (transvestites) whom they are arresting if they are dressed in women's clothing.\"\nCarlos Sanchez, the male representative of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Lesbian%20and%20Gay%20Association\"&gt;International Lesbian, Gay, Trans and Intersex Association&lt;/a&gt; for the Latin America and Caribbean Region, visited Cuba in 2004. While there, he asked about the status of lesbians and gays in the country and asked the Cuban Government why it had abstained from the vote on the \"&lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Resolution\"&gt;Brazilian Resolution&lt;/a&gt;\", a 2003 proposal to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Commission%20on%20Human%20Rights\"&gt;United Nations Commission on Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; that would symbolically recognize the \"occurrence of violations of human rights in the world against persons on the grounds of their sexual orientation.\" The Government argued that the resolution could be used to further attack and isolate Arab countries, consistent with \"North American aggression against Afghanistan and Iraq\". Sanchez also asked about the possibility of creating an LGBT organization in Cuba. The Government said that the formation of the organization would distract attention from national security in light of constant threats from the United States. After meeting with some Cuban LGBT people, Sanchez reported the following observations:\nIn 2006, the state-run Cuban television began running a serial soap opera titled \"La Otra Cara De La Luna\" (\"The Other Face of the Moon\") in which a married man \"discovers himself\" through a sexual relationship with a male friend.\nIn 2012, &lt;a href=\"Adela%20Hernandez\"&gt;Adela Hernandez&lt;/a&gt; became the first known transgender person to hold public office in Cuba, winning election as a delegate to the City Council of &lt;a href=\"Caibarien\"&gt;Caibarien&lt;/a&gt; in the central province of &lt;a href=\"Villa%20Clara%20Province\"&gt;Villa Clara&lt;/a&gt;.\nFidel Castro admits responsibility.\nIn his autobiography \"My Life\", &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Castro\"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; criticized the &lt;a href=\"machismo\"&gt;machismo&lt;/a&gt; culture of Cuba and urged for the acceptance of homosexuality. He made several speeches to the public regarding discrimination against homosexuals.\nIn a 2010 interview with Mexican newspaper \"La Jornada\", Castro called the persecution of homosexuals while he was in power \"a great injustice, great injustice!\" Taking responsibility for the persecution, he said, \"If anyone is responsible, it's me... We had so many and such terrible problems, problems of life or death. In those moments, I was not able to deal with that matter [of homosexuals]. I found myself immersed, principally, in the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis\"&gt;Crisis of October&lt;/a&gt;, in the war, in policy questions.\" Castro personally said that the negative treatment of gays in Cuba arose out of the country's pre-revolutionary attitudes toward homosexuality.\nReversals 2019-Present.\nIn May 2019 the state-run National Center for Sex Education, or Cenesex, abruptly canceled its 12th annual march against homophobia (pride parade). CENESEX, led by Mariela Castro, said only that \"international and regional tensions\" meant the parade had to be cancelled. According to the Miami Herald, this abrupt change was also motivated by increasing resistance to LGBT protections by Christian groups in Cuba, with the government hoping to avoid violent confrontations with more conservative elements. LGBT Activists condemned the cancellation and organised their own demonstration, largely through social media. Cenesex told activists not to attend the event, with some reporting receiving calls from state security. The march went on, but after setting out the marchers came up against a large number of police and state security forces. At least three were arrested with the rest ordered to disperse.\nIn August 2019, Leandro Rodr\u00edguez Garc\u00eda, director of the Cuban Foundation for LGBTI Rights, was pulled from the departure lounge at the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport while awaiting a flight to Miami, Florida. Officials told him he was not allowed to leave Cuba and prevented him from boarding, despite him having obtained a US visa. In December, Journalist Maykel Gonz\u00e1lez Vivero, director and one of the founders of Tremenda Nota, the Spanish media partner for the \"&lt;a href=\"Washington%20Blade\"&gt;Washington Blade&lt;/a&gt;\", was prohibited from traveling outside the country by the Cuban Interior Ministry. Nelson Julio \u00c1lvarez Mairata, an LGBTI YouTuber who had recently worked as a reporter for Tremenda Nota, was similarly prohibited from travel outside of Cuba. A series of hacks in 2019 targeted LGBTI reporters social media pages, with posts referencing their sexual orientation in a negative way and the release of private photos, often having sexual content.\nIn 2020 the state-run Cuban Institute of Radio and Television censored out the kiss scene between the lead male character and another boy in the 2018 U.S. film \"&lt;a href=\"Love%2C%20Simon\"&gt;Love, Simon&lt;/a&gt;\". Activists criticized the decision and began to organize a \"kiss-in\" protest of the censorship. The government, shortly before the kiss-in, published an apology for the \"mistake\" of editing out the gay kiss and organizers cancelled the protest.\nMachismo and homophobia.\nWhere \"&lt;a href=\"machismo\"&gt;machismo&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"patriarchy\"&gt;patriarchy&lt;/a&gt; are often conflated, it is important to note their difference. Patriarchy is a structure that allows for male superiority and male dominance but is generic whereas machismo has cultural implications that combines Latin American and Caribbean colonial history. Machismo is specific to Latin American culture. As a result of this culture, female sexuality was \"mystified\" and misunderstood, allowing many lesbians to escape prejudice where gay men could not.\nThe machismo culture took over after the Cuban Revolution, suppressing the homosexuality identity and using fear and punishments to ensure that this form of behavior was unacceptable and to be seen as a homosexual symbolized cowardliness and shamed the true identity of men who were machismo. In the novel \"Before Night Falls\", the author identified an experience that he had in a military camp where his true identity of homosexuality was masked by the machismo culture because the military made it known that fornicating with other men would ultimately lead to severe consequences. The fear of anyone thinking he was other than manly brought him back to a time where a kid called him a faggot and from this memory the thought if others would know what he truly was could lead others to question his own identity. Even, when he was younger homosexuals would meet at the Rub pub in order to be free and engage in sexual activities with other men without the criticisms of being homosexual.\"By making certain mannerisms unacceptable, machismo ensured that homosexuals who could neither fit traditional male roles nor conceal their erotic attraction to other men would act in a way that confirmed the machista assumption that no homosexual could possibly be un hombre de verdad\" (Lumsden, 30). These examples prove how homosexuality was oppressed in the Cuban Revolution and in order to maintain the machismo culture men needed to sneak away to private locations and some men even hid behind women in order for other men to accept them.\n\"At the outset of the Cuban Revolution, machismo was deeply integrated in the fabric of Cuban society. Gender roles were clearly identified and sharply differentiated. Men were expected to be strong, dominant, and sexually compulsive. Women were expected to be vulnerable and chaste. Because of this, many women were forced to lead domesticated lives within patriarchal family structures, finding fulfillment as wives and mothers and at best living in the reflected glory of their menfolk's social status\" (Lumsden, 55). \"The only external relationships that were recognized by Cuban culture were the sexual affairs by husbands, which were tolerated so long as the preeminence of wives over other women was affirmed in public\" (Lumsden, 56). This is a similar situation to Arena's mother where his father abandoned the family and because she not a virgin and had a child no man wanted a woman of this nature. Unfortunately, this was a norm in Cuba men leaving their families for other women and building new families with them. This lead women to take on the responsibility of raising their children while being rejected by men leading some women to fornicate with other women due to the lack of access of other men. The gender roles were switched as single women took on both responsibilities of working and raising their children.\nLGBT and capitalist association.\nPrior to the revolution, Havana was a popular tourist location. Homosexual men \"received greater employment opportunities in the tourist sector, as they were often used to satisfy the prostitution needs of US military personnel and tourists.\" Because gay men were able to gain employment, they became the subject of scorn and disdain among many Cuban communist government who sought to eliminate what they perceived as \"&lt;a href=\"bourgeoisie\"&gt;bourgeoisie&lt;/a&gt;\". During the revolution, homosexuals did not fit into the structure of the revolution that was completely reliant on the family structure.\nHomosexuals were socially rejected much more in the countryside than Havana, but until the mid 1960s this did not preclude homosexual acts from taking place. Rural Cuba's sexual culture was repressive for women, but it left space for all sorts of sexual adventures between men. It allowed homosexuals surreptitiously to conquer supposedly \"real\" men in private (Lumsden, 32). Arena's sexual experiences as a child enabled him to embrace his desires for men. During this time, men would experiment with each other and it was more accepted because men were coming into an age where they wanted to be exposed to their sexual desires. The fact that men were comfortable with their own sexuality without any machismo culture being a factor allowed men to expose themselves to other men and even within family, sharing their sexual urges with each other. This really shows that without the machismo culture homosexuality would be more accepted. The culture diminished men who would perform sexual acts with other men and made it so that these activities would be perceived as corrupting the very nature of masculinity.\nLegality of same-sex sexual activity.\nPrivate, non-commercial sexual relations between same-sex consenting adults 16 and over have been legal in &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; since 1979.\nThe Social Defence Code, which characterized \"homosexual practices\" as a \"social threat\" and imposed preventive measures to combat it, was repealed in 1979 by the Penal Code of Cuba. This Code did not criminalize homosexuality \"per se\". However, Article 359(1) criminalized those who made \"public display of their homosexual condition\" or bothered or solicited others with \"homosexual requests\". The crime of \"public display of homosexual condition\" was repealed in 1987 and the crime of bothering or soliciting with \"homosexual requests\" was amended in 1997 to refer only to \"sexual\" requests.\nProstitution.\n&lt;a href=\"Prostitution%20in%20Cuba\"&gt;Prostitution in Cuba&lt;/a&gt; has always been legal but has gone through periods of restriction and regulation over the years. Because of this, &lt;a href=\"sex%20tourism\"&gt;sex tourism&lt;/a&gt; in Cuba blossomed in the &lt;a href=\"Postcolonialism\"&gt;post-colonial era&lt;/a&gt;, giving way to a different type of chosen family. However, prostitution in Cuba began a period of significant decline in 1998 and was no longer widespread or openly seen in Cuban tourist hotspots by 2007. In 2015, \"&lt;a href=\"Anthropological%20Quarterly\"&gt;Anthropological Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that through sex work, many gay Cuban men are able to gain autonomy and sex tourists sometimes ultimately support them and their families. The dynamic between sex workers and clients reportedly evolves into a gay kinship that expands to the Cuban family. This unique relationship is important to understand the connection between finances, gay Cuban men, and sex tourists.\nRecognition of same-sex relationships.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Cuba\"&gt;Cuban Constitution&lt;/a&gt; does not ban &lt;a href=\"same-sex%20marriage\"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;. Until 2019, Article 36 contained language defining marriage as between a man and a woman. This was repealed in a &lt;a href=\"2019%20Cuban%20constitutional%20referendum\"&gt;February 2019 referendum&lt;/a&gt;. The current Constitution states that \"marriage is a social and legal institution. ... It is based on free will and equality of rights, obligations and legal capacity of the spouses.\" Nonetheless, &lt;a href=\"Statute\"&gt;statutory&lt;/a&gt; laws still contain prohibitions on same-sex marriage, and the country does not recognize &lt;a href=\"civil%20union\"&gt;civil union&lt;/a&gt;s or any other kind of partnership.\nA major public campaign by LGBT groups began in late 2017 to amend the Constitution to allow same-sex marriage. In July 2018, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20of%20People%27s%20Power\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; approved a new draft constitution which recognized same-sex marriage in Article 68. Amidst pressure from evangelical churches who opposed same-sex marriage\u2014even though President &lt;a href=\"Miguel%20D%C3%ADaz-Canel\"&gt;Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel&lt;/a&gt; expressed his support for same-sex marriage that September\u2014the National Assembly withdrew the language on 18 December 2018. As a result of removing the article, same-sex marriage is neither prohibited nor regulated by the new Cuban Constitution. Had the article remained in the draft, it would have needed to go to a referendum in February 2019. Nevertheless, media outlets spoke of a \"revolution within a revolution\" or of a \"rainbow revolution\", and pointed out how quickly the political and societal landscape for LGBT rights has changed, as just a few decades back Cuba imprisoned gay men in labor camps.\nThe National Assembly and Mariela Castro have stated that same-sex marriage will be legalized through a Family Code amendment instead. In March 2019, the Government began popular consultations to look into legalizing same-sex marriage in the Family Code.\nDiscrimination protections.\nEmployment discrimination on account of sexual orientation is prohibited by law. The Labor Code (\"C\u00f3digo de Trabajo\") does not cover gender identity, and LGBT discrimination in other sectors of society \u2013 such as education, housing and public accommodations \u2013 is not addressed by the law. Mariela Castro, director of the National Center for Sex Education, had also sought to ban employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity, HIV status and disability, but this was rejected.\nIn July 2018, a same-sex couple, Brian Canelles and Ari\u00e1n Abreu, were kicked out of a Havana bar after taking a selfie of themselves kissing. A worker at the bar asked them to leave, saying: \"The bar isn't interested in the gay public. We don't want that reputation.\" The case was widely criticized. Merely two days after the incident, Cuba's official gazette published a decree outlining that any private business found to discriminate against clients based on their gender or sexual orientation can be fined 1,000 &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20peso\"&gt;Cuban peso&lt;/a&gt;s (around 860 &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;s/1,000 &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20dollar\"&gt;U.S. dollars&lt;/a&gt;) and shut down.\nThe Cuban Constitution, amended in 2019, prohibits all discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity and sexual orientation, among others. Article 42 reads as follows:\nGender identity and expression.\nSince June 2008, qualifying Cubans have been able to have free &lt;a href=\"Sex%20reassignment%20surgery\"&gt;sex reassignment surgeries&lt;/a&gt; under \"Resoluci\u00f3n 126\" (\"Resolution 126\"). Opinion polling suggested the move was unpopular among the Cuban public.\nAs many scholars suggest, the Cuban Government treats trans rights and sex reassignment surgeries as a health issue. Cuba operates under the idea that healthcare is a right to all, allowing trans people access to &lt;a href=\"Publicly%20funded%20health%20care\"&gt;public health care&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1979, the Ministry of Public Health (MIN-SAP) established the Multidisciplinary Commission for Attention to Transsexuals to provide both specialized health care and social services. Mariela Castro Esp\u00edn describes it: \"specialists in the care of transsexual persons, and \u2026 adopted internationally approved diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, which were incorporated as services offered free of charge by the [National Public Health System], along with courses to train sex therapists.\"\nResolutions and law amendments.\nResolution 126.\nThe resolution permitting sex reassignment surgeries consisted of 11 articles that outlined the ways in which the &lt;a href=\"Politics%20of%20Cuba\"&gt;Cuban Government&lt;/a&gt; aimed to improve their treatment of the trans community. Article 5 explicitly states, that the state should provide comprehensive health care to \"all transsexual citizens\" and it is also relevant to note that \"one of the articles contains a glossary that defines various terms associated with health care for transsexual and transgender persons.\"\nLaw on the Registry of Civil Status.\nPreviously, it was required that a person's gender on official documents reflect their sexual organs but CENESEX pushed for a modification of this law. In 2013, this allowed trans people to modify their official gender without reassignment surgery.\nBlood donation.\nIndividuals seeking to donate blood must be in good health, have a regular pulse and must not have had a viral infection (&lt;a href=\"catarrh\"&gt;catarrh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"pharyngitis\"&gt;pharyngitis&lt;/a&gt;) within the past seven days. &lt;a href=\"Men%20who%20have%20sex%20with%20men\"&gt;Men who have sex with men&lt;/a&gt; are not explicitly banned from donating.\nSocial conditions.\nFreedom of association.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Lesbian%2C%20Gay%2C%20Bisexual%2C%20Trans%20and%20Intersex%20Association\"&gt;International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association&lt;/a&gt; and other sources, one of Cuba's only gay and lesbian civil rights organizations, the Cuban Association of Gays and Lesbians (\"Asociaci\u00f3n Cubana de Gays y Lesbianas\"), was formed in 1994 by eighteen people but was effectively shut down and its members arrested in 1997.\nSince 2008, the National Center of Sex Education has sponsored some LGBT festivals and pride events.\nIn 2013, a week of drag shows, colorful marches, and social and cultural events in Havana culminated with celebrations of the International Day Against Homophobia. Events have been held every year since.\nNosotros tambi\u00e9n amamos.\nIn 2015, the project \"Nosotros tambi\u00e9n amamos\" (\"We love too\") which advocates for the legalization of same-sex marriage, was funded by the human rights organizations \"Corriente Martiana\" (\"Martian Current\"), \"Fundaci\u00f3n Cubana por los Derechos LGBTI\" (\"Cuban Foundation for LGBTI Rights\") and the gay project \"SHUI TUIX\".\nIn June 2016, \"Babel\", a socio-cultural Cuban LGBT project, declared, \"all people are equal in dignity and rights beyond what differentiates us as race, skin color, sex, national origin, political, religious, ideological or sexual preferences, amongst other things\"\nSee also.\nGeneral:"
