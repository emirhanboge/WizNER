    "text": "The Qatar Masters is a &lt;a href=\"European%20Tour\"&gt;European Tour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; tournament held at &lt;a href=\"Doha%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Doha Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Doha\"&gt;Doha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qatar\"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;. When founded in 1998, it was one of two European Tour events to be staged in the &lt;a href=\"Arabian%20Peninsula\"&gt;Arabian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, but is currently one of six. From 2005 to 2007 the tournament was co-sanctioned by the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Tour\"&gt;Asian Tour&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tournament had modest fields in its early years, but with the aid of \"promotional\" money paid to top golfers to appear, and being scheduled within a three-week period that included events in &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Desert%20Classic\"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Dhabi%20Golf%20Championship\"&gt;Abu Dhabi&lt;/a&gt;, it developed to have one of the European Tour's strongest fields. \nIn 2018, due to travel restrictions between the &lt;a href=\"United%20Arab%20Emirates\"&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Qatar\"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Qatar%E2%80%93Saudi%20Arabia%20diplomatic%20conflict\"&gt;diplomatic dispute&lt;/a&gt; in the Arab World, it was moved to later in the year, and is no longer held at the same time as the Abu Dhabi and Dubai events. The date change coincided with a reduction in prize money, and resulted in a lower field strength than previous editions."
