    "text": "Buborn is an \"&lt;a href=\"Ortsgemeinde\"&gt;Ortsgemeinde&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2013 a &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20of%20Germany\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; belonging to a \"&lt;a href=\"Verbandsgemeinde\"&gt;Verbandsgemeinde&lt;/a&gt;\", a kind of collective municipality \u2013 in the &lt;a href=\"Kusel%20%28district%29\"&gt;Kusel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Germany\"&gt;district&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. It belongs to the &lt;a href=\"Lauterecken-Wolfstein\"&gt;\"Verbandsgemeinde\" Lauterecken-Wolfstein&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nThe municipality lies in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Palatine%20Uplands\"&gt;North Palatine Uplands&lt;/a&gt; in the Western &lt;a href=\"Palatinate%20%28region%29\"&gt;Palatinate&lt;/a&gt;. The village sits at an elevation of roughly 280\u00a0m above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt; in a hollow on the banks of the R\u00f6telbach at the edge of a plateau. Elevations around the village reach heights of about 350\u00a0m above sea level. The municipal area measures 287\u00a0ha, of which 6\u00a0ha is settled and 40\u00a0ha is wooded.\nNeighbouring municipalities.\nBuborn borders in the northeast on the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Hausweiler\"&gt;Hausweiler&lt;/a&gt;, in the southeast on the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Wiesweiler\"&gt;Wiesweiler&lt;/a&gt;, in the south on the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Offenbach-Hundheim\"&gt;Offenbach-Hundheim&lt;/a&gt;, in the west on the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Deimberg\"&gt;Deimberg&lt;/a&gt; and in the northwest on the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Herren-Sulzbach\"&gt;Herren-Sulzbach&lt;/a&gt;. Buborn also meets the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Grumbach\"&gt;Grumbach&lt;/a&gt; at a single point in the north.\nConstituent communities.\nAlso belonging to Buborn are three outlying \"&lt;a href=\"Aussiedlerh%C3%B6fe\"&gt;Aussiedlerh\u00f6fe&lt;/a&gt;\" (a farming settlement established most often after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;).\nMunicipality\u2019s layout.\nBuborn is a clump village that has been thrust together, one with old buildings, and with a north-south through road cutting through it. The small graveyard lies at the village's south end. All together, there is very little in the way of new building.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nWhile it is assumed that the area around the village was already settled in &lt;a href=\"Prehistory\"&gt;prehistoric times&lt;/a&gt;, there are no &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;archaeological&lt;/a&gt; finds bearing witness to this. What is known, however, is that the foundations of a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"villa%20rustica\"&gt;villa rustica&lt;/a&gt; are to be found within the municipality. Unearthed there were wall remnants, urns and pots from Roman times. In this vicinity, too, it is likely that a village known as Guckenhausen later lay, although it is not thought that this represents a continuity in settlement from Roman times to the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Early Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiddle Ages.\nIt is likely that Buborn arose in the later expansion phase that took hold in this area, thus in the 10th or 11th century. Until the early 12th century, the village belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Nahegau\"&gt;Nahegau&lt;/a&gt;, and then to the County of the &lt;a href=\"Waldgrave\"&gt;Waldgrave&lt;/a&gt;s, who can be considered the Nahegau counts\u2019 successors. From a judicial point of view, Buborn lay within the jurisdiction of the \"Hochgericht auf der Heide\" (\u201c&lt;a href=\"Blood%20court\"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Heath\"&gt;Heath&lt;/a&gt;\u201d). Records tell of a knight named Albert from the Nahegau, who in the early 12th century unrighfully took ownership of the Remigiusberg (a mountain with a like-named &lt;a href=\"monastery\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt;). Later, though, after the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s had bought the mountain back, Albert himself took orders at the newly founded monastery there, and, among other things, bequeathed two estates in \"Buhrbur\" to it.\nIn 1319, the Waldgraves of Kyrburg raised a claim to the jurisdiction in Buborn, which also stretched out to the surrounding villages. At the Kyrburger Hof, an estate held by the Waldgraves of Kyrburg in the Buborn area, the Waldgraves held court (they called it the \"Eicher Gericht\"). No sooner had Buborn ended up in the Waldgraves\u2019 hands than a whole series of surrounding villages subject to the \"Hochgericht auf der Heide\" were pledged by Johann von Dhaun to the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Sponheim\"&gt;County of Sponheim&lt;/a&gt;-Starkenburg. It is known, however, that the village itself was pledged at this time as \"Hof in Bopporn\" (\"Hof\" means \u201cestate\u201d) to Reinfried von Reipoltskirchen. The exact date of the deed is unknown. Nevertheless, Buborn was in his hands in 1408 when Waldgrave Gerhard V died. The pledge was further passed on in 1431 to Friedrich von R\u00fcdesheim, Reinfried von Reipoltskirchen's son-in-law. Shortly thereafter, the Waldgraves must have redeemed the pledge, for in 1448, Waldgrave and Rhinegrave Gottfried zu Dhaun sold the village, along with others in the Grumbacher Tal (dale), while reserving the right to buy them back, to Count Palatine Stephan of Zweibr\u00fccken. The Waldgraves exercised this right in 1477. It is likely that in the early 16th century, Buborn belonged to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Grumbach. In 1515, Buborn was firmly in this county's hands, and the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Grumbach thereby also held the jurisdiction. From this year comes a \"Weistum\" that states that both jurisdiction (that is, the court's power) and the lordship were held not by Kyrburg, but rather by \"Grombach\" (a \"Weistum\" \u2013 &lt;a href=\"cognate\"&gt;cognate&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; \"wisdom\" \u2013 was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; and early modern times).\nThe village's &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;mediaeval&lt;/a&gt; history, just like neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Herren-Sulzbach\"&gt;Herren-Sulzbach&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s and the Sch\u00f6nborner Hof\u2019s, is tightly bound with the &lt;a href=\"Sovereign%20Military%20Order%20of%20Malta\"&gt;Knights of Saint John&lt;/a&gt;. The order\u2019s original seat was the Sch\u00f6nborner Hof (estate) near &lt;a href=\"Homberg%2C%20Kusel\"&gt;Homberg&lt;/a&gt;, before later moving to Herren-Sulzbach, and later still, in the 14th century, to their new administrative hub in Buborn, where they built a manor building that they then called the \"Commenturhof\" (\u201c&lt;a href=\"Commandry%20%28feudalism%29\"&gt;Commendator's&lt;/a&gt; Estate\u201d). The land where this once stood is today known in Buborn as the \"Kirchgarten\" (\u201cChurch Garden\u201d).\nThe origin of the Knights of Saint John was a &lt;a href=\"hospital\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"pilgrim\"&gt;pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;s and the sick in &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20du%20Puy%20de%20Provence\"&gt;Raymond du Puy de Provence&lt;/a&gt; (1083-1160), the order's first &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Master%20%28order%29\"&gt;Grand Master&lt;/a&gt; (1120-1160) enacted sometime about 1155 the order's first constitution. The order first quickly spread in Mediterranean Europe. Beginning in 1137, the Knights also took on the task of armed border protection, thereby becoming an ecclesiastical knightly order. In 1309, the order founded on the island of &lt;a href=\"Rhodes\"&gt;Rhodes&lt;/a&gt; a sovereign knightly state. After the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt; there was, besides the original &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; branch a new &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; branch, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Saint%20John%20%28Bailiwick%20of%20Brandenburg%29\"&gt;Bailiwick of Brandenburg of the Chivalric Order of Saint John of the Hospital at Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, which persists to this day. Since 1859, the Catholic branch has borne the name Order of Malta.\nModern times.\nThe presence of Knights of Saint John also characterized the history in the 16th and 17th centuries. Until the time of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, Buborn belonged to the Lordship of the Counts of Grumbach. During the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt;, marauding troops repeatedly plundered the village, and only a few people survived the war. Likewise, the village suffered in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV%20of%20France\"&gt;King Louis XIV's&lt;/a&gt; wars of conquest.\nRecent times.\nDuring the time of the French Revolution and the &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;ic era that followed, the German lands on the &lt;a href=\"Rhine\"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s left bank were &lt;a href=\"Annexation\"&gt;annexed&lt;/a&gt; by France. Buborn then belonged to the \"Mairie\" (\u201cMayoralty\u201d) of Grumbach, which was the seat of a like-named &lt;a href=\"Cantons%20of%20France\"&gt;canton&lt;/a&gt;, which itself belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Arrondissements%20of%20France\"&gt;Arrondissement&lt;/a&gt; of Birkenfeld in the &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;Department&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sarre%20%28department%29\"&gt;Sarre&lt;/a&gt; (\"D\u00e9partement de la Sarre\"). In 1793, &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolutionary%20Wars\"&gt;French Revolutionary troops&lt;/a&gt; advanced through the &lt;a href=\"Glan%20%28Nahe%29\"&gt;Glan&lt;/a&gt; valley and quartered themselves in villages near Grumbach, including Buborn, leading to abuses by the troops against the local populace. After French rule ended, the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Lichtenberg\"&gt;Principality of Lichtenberg&lt;/a&gt; in 1816, which was awarded as a newly created &lt;a href=\"exclave\"&gt;exclave&lt;/a&gt; to the Duchy of &lt;a href=\"Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld\"&gt;Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld&lt;/a&gt;, which as of 1826 became the Duchy of &lt;a href=\"Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha\"&gt;Saxe-Coburg and Gotha&lt;/a&gt;. In 1834, the duchy sold this principality to the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;. Within Prussia's &lt;a href=\"Rhine%20Province\"&gt;Rhine Province&lt;/a&gt;, it formed the district of Sankt Wendel, which was in turn divided into several \"&lt;a href=\"Amt%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;\u00c4mter&lt;/a&gt;\". Within the district of Sankt Wendel, Buborn belonged to the \"Amt\" of Grumbach. Later, after the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt; stipulated, among other things, that 26 of the Sankt Wendel district's 94 municipalities had to be ceded to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;- and French-&lt;a href=\"Military%20occupation\"&gt;occupied&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saar%20%28League%20of%20Nations%29\"&gt;Saar&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining 68 municipalities then bore the designation \u201cRestkreis St. Wendel-Baumholder\u201d, with the first syllable of \"Restkreis\" having the same meaning as in English, in the sense of \u201cleft over\u201d. Buborn belonged to this district until 1937, when it was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Birkenfeld%20%28district%29\"&gt;Birkenfeld district&lt;/a&gt;. In 1969, it was transferred, this time to the Kusel district, in which it remains today. After the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the village at first lay within the \"&lt;a href=\"Regierungsbezirk\"&gt;Regierungsbezirk&lt;/a&gt;\" of Koblenz in the then newly founded &lt;a href=\"States%20of%20Germany\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt;. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1968, the \"Amt\" of Grumbach was dissolved. On New Year's Day 1972, Buborn passed to the newly founded &lt;a href=\"Lauterecken%20%28Verbandsgemeinde%29\"&gt;\"Verbandsgemeinde\" of Lauterecken&lt;/a&gt;, and at the same time from the \"Regierungsbezirk\" of Koblenz to the newly founded \"Regierungsbezirk\" of &lt;a href=\"Rheinhessen-Pfalz\"&gt;Rheinhessen-Pfalz&lt;/a&gt;, which has since been dissolved.\nPopulation development.\nThe village has a rural structure to this day. Until a few decades ago, most of the villagers earned their livelihoods in &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt;. Besides farmers, there were also farmhands, forestry workers, quarrymen and a few craftsmen. There were hardly any other jobs to be had. Even today, the municipal area is under agricultural use. Nevertheless, a great number of people in Buborn need to seek work outside the village. As early as 1955, out of 52 members of the workforce, 46 held jobs outside the village. Worthy of note is that Buborn's population rose less markedly than neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Homberg%2C%20Kusel\"&gt;Homberg's&lt;/a&gt; in the course of the 19th century, and since the turn of the 20th century, Buborn's population has remained hardly changed.\nThe following table shows population development over the centuries for Buborn:\nMunicipality\u2019s name.\nAbout 1120, the village was mentioned in a document as \"Burbur\", and in a 1290 original document as \"Hof zu Bopure\" (the first two words meaning \u201cestate at\u201d). The name's form underwent a number of changes in older documents: \"Buhrbur\" (1127), \"Buppura\" (1152 and 1154), \"Potbor\" (1315), \"Butbure\" (1351), \"Boppren\" (1459), and in the local speech \"Buwere\". Only in 1797 did the current name Buborn appear. The first syllable is drawn from a personal name, \u201cBurdo\u201d or \u201cBurto\u201d, while the placename ending, although resembling the common placename ending \"\u2014born\", apparently does not mean \u201c&lt;a href=\"spring%20%28hydrosphere%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;\u201d, but rather \u201chouse\u201d or \u201cdwelling\u201d (the root still appears in the &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; word \"Vogelbauer\", meaning \u201cbirdcage\u201d, and it even has a &lt;a href=\"cognate\"&gt;cognate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;: \u201cbower\u201d). Thus, the name may be interpreted as meaning \u201cBurdo\u2019s house\u201d.\nVanished villages.\nRural cadastral names within Buborn's limits point to a former village named \u201cGuckenhausen\u201d. This village, whose former existence is only assumed, may well have been older than Buborn, but its name never appears in any &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;mediaeval&lt;/a&gt; documents, but rather is only attested in these rural names. The ending means \u201chouse\u201d while the prefix is drawn from a personal name, \u201cGucko\u201d or \u201cKucko\u201d. Thus, the name may be interpreted as meaning \u201cGucko\u2019s house\u201d or \u201cGucko\u2019s small settlement\u201d.\nReligion.\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Early Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, Buborn belonged to the parish of the neighbouring village of &lt;a href=\"Herren-Sulzbach\"&gt;Herren-Sulzbach&lt;/a&gt;. Buborn has never had its own church. Beginning in the 14th century, though, the &lt;a href=\"Sovereign%20Military%20Order%20of%20Malta\"&gt;Knights of Saint John&lt;/a&gt; kept their administrative seat here. The Order also owned considerable lands, and had likewise established a location in &lt;a href=\"Meisenheim\"&gt;Meisenheim&lt;/a&gt;. In the time of the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights lost all their influence in the parish of Herren-Sulzbach. In 1556, the Reformation was introduced into Buborn, and then, that same year, the Knights, under their Grand Master, Prince Georg von Schilling, first pledged the greater part of their holdings to the Lordship of the Grumbachs under Rhinegrave Philipp Franz. In the early 17th century, the Grumbachs gained full ownership of these pledged holdings and paid a price of 3,200 \"Gulden\". In 1606, the \"Commenturhof\" at Buborn likewise passed into the Grumbachs\u2019 ownership, only to be forthwith passed by them to landholder Boso Strau\u00df von Herren-Sulzbach, receiving in return from him the Sch\u00f6nborner Hof. Although the Knights of Saint John kept up their presence in the domains of the &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Church%20in%20Germany\"&gt;Evangelical Church&lt;/a&gt;, they could no longer hold their own in &lt;a href=\"Herren-Sulzbach\"&gt;Herren-Sulzbach&lt;/a&gt;. In the Waldgravial-Rhinegravial House of Grumbach, the Evangelical parish of Herren-Sulzbach was founded in 1556. Belonging thereto right from the beginning were all villages in the \"&lt;a href=\"Amt%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;Amt&lt;/a&gt;\" of Grumbach but the ones lying on the river &lt;a href=\"Glan%20%28Nahe%29\"&gt;Glan&lt;/a&gt;. Until the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt;, all villagers were Evangelical. Later, the lordship had to tolerate other denominations, although thus far none has gained any truly meaningful numbers.\nPolitics.\nMunicipal council.\nThe council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by &lt;a href=\"Plurality%20voting%20system\"&gt;majority vote&lt;/a&gt; at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\nMayor.\nBuborn's mayor is Philipp Kreischer.\nCoat of arms.\nThe municipality's &lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;arms&lt;/a&gt; might be described thus: Per bend sinister Or a lion rampant sinister gules armed and langued azure and azure a handpump-well argent.\nThe lion &lt;a href=\"charge%20%28heraldry%29\"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt; on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is an heraldic device formerly borne by the village's &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;mediaeval&lt;/a&gt; lords, the &lt;a href=\"Waldgrave\"&gt;Waldgrave&lt;/a&gt;s. The charge on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side, the handpump-well, is a &lt;a href=\"Canting%20arms\"&gt;canting&lt;/a&gt; element and refers to the latter syllable in the village's name, \"\u2014born\", which, although historically referring to a spring, can also refer to a well (the more usual form is \"Brunnen\"). This is, nevertheless, a false assumption. Historically, the last syllable in the village's name refers to a dwelling, not a well.\nThe arms have been borne since 23 July 1964 when they were approved by &lt;a href=\"Rhineland-Palatinate\"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s Ministry of the Interior.\nCulture and sightseeing.\nRegular events.\nBuborn\u2019s &lt;a href=\"kermis\"&gt;kermis&lt;/a&gt; (church consecration festival) is held each year on the third weekend in July. Old customs, such as were formerly practised in all villages in the Glan region, are seldom if at all observed today.\nClubs.\nBuborn has long enjoyed its men\u2019s singing club and its &lt;a href=\"Gymnastics\"&gt;gymnastic&lt;/a&gt; club.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nEconomic structure.\nIn the time following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, the number of &lt;a href=\"Agriculture\"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt; operations shrank dramatically, though lands useful to agriculture remained mostly intact. The farming operations that did not shut down therefore expanded. Primary occupations, though, became secondary occupations. For the last decade or so, however, farms have gradually been being given up.\nEducation.\nAs in all the other villages in the \"&lt;a href=\"Amt%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;Amt&lt;/a&gt;\" of Grumbach, there likewise arose in Buborn in the late 16th century, owing to the effect of the Reformation, efforts to teach children to &lt;a href=\"Literacy\"&gt;read and write&lt;/a&gt;. At first, though, schoolchildren had to attend classes in neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Herren-Sulzbach\"&gt;Herren-Sulzbach&lt;/a&gt;. There, lessons for all the parish\u2019s schoolchildren were taught at a herdsman\u2019s house. Only about 1814 did every village get its own school. Buborn\u2019s tiny schoolroom was only equipped with two tables. A further, smaller room next door served the teacher as a dwelling. Only in 1865 did the municipality have its own &lt;a href=\"one-room%20school\"&gt;one-room school&lt;/a&gt;house built. On this schoolhouse hung a bell with the inscription \u201c\"Wer mich nimmt verliert\"\u201d (\u201cHe who takes me loses\u201d). This warning was even enough to dissuade the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Party\"&gt;Nazis&lt;/a&gt; from seizing the bell to use its metal in the war effort, and unlike many other bells, it was still there by the time the Second World War ended. The one-room schoolhouse lasted until the late 1960s. Thereafter, &lt;a href=\"primary%20school\"&gt;primary school&lt;/a&gt; pupils attended the Grumbach-Hoppst\u00e4dten primary school, which itself lasted until 2010, whereas the &lt;a href=\"Hauptschule\"&gt;Hauptschule&lt;/a&gt; students began attending school in &lt;a href=\"Lauterecken\"&gt;Lauterecken&lt;/a&gt; right away. Once the old primary school closed, the primary school pupils, too, began attending school there. The Lauterecken &lt;a href=\"Gymnasium%20%28school%29\"&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s buildings stand only a few kilometres from Buborn.\nTransport.\nBuborn lies on \"Kreisstra\u00dfe\" (District Road) 37, which links it to \"&lt;a href=\"Bundesstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Bundesstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt;\" 270. To the southeast runs \"Bundesstra\u00dfe\" 420, which can be reached over \"Kreisstra\u00dfen\" 37 and then 63. The nearest &lt;a href=\"Autobahn\"&gt;Autobahn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"interchange%20%28road%29\"&gt;interchange&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Kusel\"&gt;Kusel&lt;/a&gt;, is 25\u00a0km away. Serving &lt;a href=\"Lauterecken\"&gt;Lauterecken&lt;/a&gt;, some 5\u00a0km away, is a &lt;a href=\"railway%20station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt; on the \"&lt;a href=\"Lautertalbahn\"&gt;Lautertalbahn&lt;/a&gt;\"."
