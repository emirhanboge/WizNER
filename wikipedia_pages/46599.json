The municipality of Leiden has a population of 119,713, but the city forms one densely connected agglomeration with its suburbs &lt;a href=\"Oegstgeest\"&gt;Oegstgeest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leiderdorp\"&gt;Leiderdorp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voorschoten\"&gt;Voorschoten&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zoeterwoude\"&gt;Zoeterwoude&lt;/a&gt; with 206,647 inhabitants. The &lt;a href=\"Statistics%20Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics&lt;/a&gt; (CBS) further includes &lt;a href=\"Katwijk\"&gt;Katwijk&lt;/a&gt; in the agglomeration which makes the total population of the Leiden urban agglomeration 270,879, and in the larger Leiden urban area also &lt;a href=\"Teylingen\"&gt;Teylingen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Noordwijk\"&gt;Noordwijk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Noordwijkerhout\"&gt;Noordwijkerhout&lt;/a&gt; are included with in total 348,868 inhabitants. Leiden is located on the &lt;a href=\"Oude%20Rijn%20%28Utrecht%20and%20South%20Holland%29\"&gt;Oude Rijn&lt;/a&gt;, at a distance of some from &lt;a href=\"The%20Hague\"&gt;The Hague&lt;/a&gt; to its south and some from &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam\"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; to its north. The recreational area of the Kaag Lakes (&lt;a href=\"Kagerplassen\"&gt;Kagerplassen&lt;/a&gt;) lies just to the northeast of Leiden.\nA &lt;a href=\"University%20town\"&gt;university city&lt;/a&gt; since 1575, Leiden has been one of &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;'s most prominent scientific centres for more than four centuries. Leiden is a typical &lt;a href=\"University%20town\"&gt;university city&lt;/a&gt;, university buildings are scattered throughout the city and the many students from all over the world give the city a bustling, vivid and international atmosphere. Many important scientific discoveries have been made here, giving rise to Leiden's motto: \u2018City of Discoveries\u2019. The city houses &lt;a href=\"Leiden%20University\"&gt;Leiden University&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest university of the Netherlands, and &lt;a href=\"Leiden%20University%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Leiden University Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. Leiden University is one of Europe's top universities, with thirteen Nobel Prize winners. It is a member of the League of European Research Universities and positioned highly in all international academic rankings. It is twinned with &lt;a href=\"Oxford\"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, the location of the United Kingdom's oldest &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;university&lt;/a&gt;. Leiden University and Leiden University of Applied Sciences (Leidse Hogeschool) together have around 35,000 students. Modern scientific medical research and teaching started in the early 18th century in Leiden with Boerhaave.\nLeiden is a city with a rich cultural heritage, not only in science, but also in the arts. One of the world's most famous painters, &lt;a href=\"Rembrandt\"&gt;Rembrandt&lt;/a&gt;, was born and educated in Leiden. Other famous Leiden painters include &lt;a href=\"Lucas%20van%20Leyden\"&gt;Lucas van Leyden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jan%20van%20Goyen\"&gt;Jan van Goyen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Steen\"&gt;Jan Steen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLeiden was formed on an artificial hill (today called the &lt;a href=\"Burcht%20van%20Leiden\"&gt;Burcht van Leiden&lt;/a&gt;) at the confluence of the rivers Oude and Nieuwe Rijn (Old and New Rhine). In the oldest reference to this, from circa 860, the settlement was called \"Leithon\". The name is said to be from Germanic *leitha- \"canal\" in &lt;a href=\"dative\"&gt;dative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pluralis\"&gt;pluralis&lt;/a&gt;, thus meaning \"at the canals\". \"Canal\" is actually not the completely proper word. A leitha (later \"lede\") was a human-modified natural river, partly natural, partly artificial.\nLeiden has in the past erroneously been associated with the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"castellum\"&gt;outpost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brittenburg\"&gt;Lugdunum Batavorum&lt;/a&gt;. This particular \"castellum\" was thought to be located at the Burcht of Leiden, and the city's name was thought to be derived from the Latin name Lugdunum. However the castellum was in fact closer to the town of &lt;a href=\"Katwijk\"&gt;Katwijk&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the Roman settlement near modern-day Leiden was called &lt;a href=\"Matilo\"&gt;Matilo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe landlord of Leiden, situated in a stronghold on the hill (motte), was initially subject to the Bishop of &lt;a href=\"Bishopric%20of%20Utrecht\"&gt;Utrecht&lt;/a&gt; but around 1100 the &lt;a href=\"burgrave\"&gt;burgrave&lt;/a&gt;s became subject to the county of Holland. This county got its name in 1101 from a domain near the stronghold: \"Holtland\" or \"Holland\".\nLeiden was sacked in 1047 by Emperor &lt;a href=\"Henry%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Henry III&lt;/a&gt;. Early 13th century, &lt;a href=\"Ada%2C%20Countess%20of%20Holland\"&gt;Ada, Countess of Holland&lt;/a&gt; took refuge here when she was fighting in a civil war against her uncle, &lt;a href=\"William%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Holland\"&gt;William I, Count of Holland&lt;/a&gt;. He besieged the stronghold and captured Ada.\nLeiden received &lt;a href=\"City%20rights%20in%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;city rights&lt;/a&gt; in 1266. In 1389, its population had grown to about 4,000 persons.\nSiege of 1420.\nIn 1420, during the &lt;a href=\"Hook%20and%20Cod%20wars\"&gt;Hook and Cod wars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria\"&gt;Duke John III of Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; along with his army marched from &lt;a href=\"Gouda%2C%20South%20Holland\"&gt;Gouda&lt;/a&gt; in the direction of Leiden in order to conquer the city since Leiden did not pay the new &lt;a href=\"Count%20of%20Holland\"&gt;Count of Holland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jacqueline%2C%20Countess%20of%20Hainaut\"&gt;Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut&lt;/a&gt;, his niece and only daughter of &lt;a href=\"William%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria-Straubing\"&gt;Count William VI of Holland&lt;/a&gt;.\nBurgrave Filips of Wassenaar and the other local noblemen of the Hook faction assumed that the duke would besiege Leiden first and send small units out to conquer the surrounding citadels. But &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Bavaria-Straubing\"&gt;John of Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; chose to attack the citadels first.\nHe rolled the cannons along with his army but one which was too heavy went by ship. By firing at the walls and gates with iron balls the citadels fell one by one. Within a week John of Bavaria conquered the castles of Poelgeest, Ter Does, Hoichmade, de Zijl, ter Waerd, Warmond and de Paddenpoel.\nOn 24 June the army appeared before the walls of Leiden. On 17 August 1420, after a two-month siege the city surrendered to John of Bavaria. The burgrave Filips of Wassenaar was stripped of his offices and rights and lived out his last years in captivity.\n16th to 18th centuries.\nLeiden flourished in the 16th and 17th century. At the close of the 15th century the &lt;a href=\"weaving\"&gt;weaving&lt;/a&gt; establishments (mainly &lt;a href=\"broadcloth\"&gt;broadcloth&lt;/a&gt;) of Leiden were very important. After the expulsion of the Spaniards, Leiden cloth, Leiden &lt;a href=\"baize\"&gt;baize&lt;/a&gt; and Leiden &lt;a href=\"camlet\"&gt;camlet&lt;/a&gt; were familiar terms. In the same period, Leiden developed an important printing and publishing industry. The influential printer &lt;a href=\"Christoffel%20Plantijn\"&gt;Christoffel Plantijn&lt;/a&gt; lived there at one time. One of his pupils was &lt;a href=\"Lodewijk%20Elzevir\"&gt;Lodewijk Elzevir&lt;/a&gt; (1547\u20131617), who established the largest bookshop and printing works in Leiden, a business continued by &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Elzevir\"&gt;his descendants&lt;/a&gt; through 1712 and the name subsequently adopted (in a variant spelling) by contemporary publisher &lt;a href=\"Elsevier\"&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 1572, the city sided with the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Revolt\"&gt;Dutch revolt&lt;/a&gt; against Spanish rule and played an important role in the &lt;a href=\"Eighty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Eighty Years' War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Leiden\"&gt;Besieged&lt;/a&gt; from May until October 1574 by the Spanish, Leiden was relieved by the cutting of the &lt;a href=\"dike%20%28construction%29\"&gt;dikes&lt;/a&gt;, thus enabling ships to carry provisions to the inhabitants of the flooded town. As a reward for the heroic defence of the previous year, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Leiden\"&gt;University of Leiden&lt;/a&gt; was founded by &lt;a href=\"William%20I%20of%20Orange\"&gt;William I of Orange&lt;/a&gt; in 1575. Yearly on 3 October, the end of the siege is still celebrated in Leiden. Tradition tells that the citizens were offered the choice between a university and a certain exemption from taxes and chose the university. The siege is notable also for being the first instance in Europe of the issuance of &lt;a href=\"paper%20money\"&gt;paper money&lt;/a&gt;, with paper taken from prayer books being stamped using coin dies when silver ran out.\nLeiden is also known as the place where the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrims%20%28Plymouth%20Colony%29\"&gt;Pilgrims&lt;/a&gt; (as well as some of the first settlers of &lt;a href=\"New%20Amsterdam\"&gt;New Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;) lived (and operated a printing press) for a time in the early 17th century before their departure to Massachusetts and New Amsterdam in the &lt;a href=\"New%20World\"&gt;New World&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 17th century, Leiden prospered, in part because of the impetus to the textile industry by refugees from &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt;. While the city had lost about a third of its 15,000 citizens during the siege of 1574, it quickly recovered to 45,000 inhabitants in 1622, and may have come near to 70,000 circa 1670. During the Dutch Golden Era, Leiden was the second largest city of Holland, after Amsterdam. Particularly due to the work by &lt;a href=\"Herman%20Boerhaave\"&gt;Herman Boerhaave&lt;/a&gt; (1668\u20131738), it played a crucial role in the establishment of modern chemistry and medicine.\nFrom the late 17th century onwards Leiden slumped, mainly due to the decline of the cloth industries. In the beginning of the 19th century the baize manufacture was altogether given up, although industry remained central to Leiden economy. This decline is painted vividly by the fall in population. The population of Leiden had sunk to 30,000 between 1796 and 1811, and in 1904 was 56,044.\nFrom the 17th to the early 19th century, Leiden was the publishing place of one of the most important contemporary journals, \"&lt;a href=\"Nouvelles%20Extraordinaires%20de%20Divers%20Endroits\"&gt;Nouvelles Extraordinaires de Divers Endroits&lt;/a&gt;\", known also as \"Gazette de Leyde\".\n19th and 20th centuries.\nOn 12 January 1807, a &lt;a href=\"Leiden%20gunpowder%20disaster\"&gt;catastrophe&lt;/a&gt; struck the city when a boat loaded with of gunpowder blew up in the middle of Leiden. 151 people were killed, over 2,000 were injured and some 220 homes were destroyed. King &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Louis Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt; personally visited the city to provide assistance to the victims. Although located in the centre of the city, the area destroyed remained empty for many years. In 1886 the space was turned into a public park, the Van der Werff park.\nIn 1842, the railroad from Leiden to &lt;a href=\"Haarlem\"&gt;Haarlem&lt;/a&gt; was inaugurated and one year later the railway to &lt;a href=\"The%20Hague\"&gt;The Hague&lt;/a&gt; (Den Haag) was completed, resulting in some social and economic improvement. Perhaps the most important piece of Dutch history contributed by Leiden was the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Constitution of the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Rudolf%20Thorbecke\"&gt;Johan Rudolf Thorbecke&lt;/a&gt; (1798\u20131872) wrote the Dutch Constitution in April 1848 in his house at Garenmarkt 9 in Leiden.\nLeiden's reputation as the \"city of books\" continued through the 19th century with the establishment of publishing dynasties by &lt;a href=\"Evert%20Jan%20Brill\"&gt;Evert Jan Brill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Albertus%20Willem%20Sijthoff\"&gt;Albertus Willem Sijthoff&lt;/a&gt;. Sijthoff, who rose to prominence in the trade of translated books, wrote a letter in 1899 to &lt;a href=\"Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Queen Wilhelmina&lt;/a&gt; regarding his opposition to becoming a signatory to the &lt;a href=\"Berne%20Convention%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Literary%20and%20Artistic%20Works\"&gt;Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works&lt;/a&gt;. He felt that international copyright restrictions would stifle the Dutch publishing industry.\nLeiden began to expand beyond its 17th-century moats around 1896 and the number of citizens surpassed 50,000 in 1900. After 1920, new industries were established in the city, such as the &lt;a href=\"canning\"&gt;canning&lt;/a&gt; and metal industries. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Leiden was hit hard by Allied bombardments. The areas surrounding the railway station and Marewijk were almost completely destroyed.\nLeiden today.\nThe city's biggest and most popular annual festival is celebrated on 3 October and is called simply &lt;a href=\"3%20October%20Festival\"&gt;3 Oktober&lt;/a&gt;. The people of Leiden celebrate the end of the Spanish siege of 1574. It typically takes place over the course of two to three days (usually two but three if there's a Sunday involved) and includes parades, a &lt;a href=\"hutspot\"&gt;hutspot&lt;/a&gt; feast, historical reenactments, a funfair and other events. The city has recently started to host the &lt;a href=\"Leiden%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Leiden International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;, the fastest growing festival of its type in the Netherlands.\nLeiden has important functions as a shopping and trade centre for communities around the city. The University of Leiden is famous for its many discoveries including Snells law (by &lt;a href=\"Willebrord%20Snellius\"&gt;Willebrord Snellius&lt;/a&gt;),\nthe famous &lt;a href=\"Leyden%20jar\"&gt;Leyden jar&lt;/a&gt;, a capacitor made from a glass jar, invented in Leiden by &lt;a href=\"Pieter%20van%20Musschenbroek\"&gt;Pieter van Musschenbroek&lt;/a&gt; in 1746. Another development was in &lt;a href=\"cryogenics\"&gt;cryogenics&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Heike%20Kamerlingh%20Onnes\"&gt;Heike Kamerlingh Onnes&lt;/a&gt; (1913 &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics\"&gt;Nobel prize winner in physics&lt;/a&gt;) liquefied &lt;a href=\"helium\"&gt;helium&lt;/a&gt; for the first time (1908) and later managed to reach a temperature of less than one degree above the &lt;a href=\"absolute%20zero\"&gt;absolute minimum&lt;/a&gt;. Albert Einstein also spent some time at Leiden University during his early to middle career.\nThe city also houses the &lt;a href=\"Eurotransplant\"&gt;Eurotransplant&lt;/a&gt;, the international organization responsible for the mediation and allocation of &lt;a href=\"organ%20donation\"&gt;organ donation&lt;/a&gt; procedures in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Slovenia. Leiden also houses the headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Airbus\"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, a global pan-European aerospace and defence corporation and a leading defence and military contractor worldwide. The group includes &lt;a href=\"Airbus\"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, the leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft worldwide.\nRivers, canals and parks.\nThe two branches of the &lt;a href=\"Oude%20Rijn%20%28Utrecht%20and%20South%20Holland%29\"&gt;Oude Rijn&lt;/a&gt;, which enter Leiden on the east, unite in the centre of the city. The city is further intersected by numerous small &lt;a href=\"canal\"&gt;canal&lt;/a&gt;s with tree-bordered &lt;a href=\"quay\"&gt;quay&lt;/a&gt;s. On the west side of the city, the &lt;a href=\"Hortus%20Botanicus%20Leiden\"&gt;Hortus Botanicus&lt;/a&gt; and other gardens extend along the old \"&lt;a href=\"Singel\"&gt;Singel&lt;/a&gt;\", or outer canal. The &lt;a href=\"Leidse%20Hout\"&gt;Leidse Hout&lt;/a&gt; park, which contains a small deer park, lies on the northwest border with &lt;a href=\"Oegstgeest\"&gt;Oegstgeest&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Van der Werf Park\" is named after the mayor , who defended the city against the Spaniards in 1574. The city was beleaguered for months and many died from famine. The open space for the park was formed by the &lt;a href=\"Leiden%20Gunpowder%20Disaster\"&gt;accidental explosion&lt;/a&gt; of a ship loaded with &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; in 1807, which destroyed hundreds of houses, including that of the Elsevier family of &lt;a href=\"Printer%20%28publisher%29\"&gt;printers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuildings of interest.\nBecause of the economic decline from the end of the 17th until the middle of the 19th century, much of the 16th- and 17th-century city centre is still intact. It is the second largest 17th-century town centre in the Netherlands, the largest being Amsterdam's city centre.\nA hundred buildings in the centre are decorated with large murals of poetry, part of a &lt;a href=\"Wall%20poems%20in%20Leiden\"&gt;wall poem project&lt;/a&gt; active from 1992, and still ongoing.\nFortifications.\nAt the strategically important junction of the two arms of the Oude Rijn stands the old &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; \"de Burcht\", a circular tower built on an earthen mound. The mound probably was a refuge against high water before a small wooden fortress was built on top of it in the 11th century. The citadel is a so-called &lt;a href=\"motte-and-bailey\"&gt;motte-and-bailey&lt;/a&gt; castle. Of Leiden's old &lt;a href=\"city%20gate\"&gt;city gate&lt;/a&gt;s only two are left, the \"&lt;a href=\"Zijlpoort%20%28Leiden%29\"&gt;Zijlpoort&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"Morspoort\", both dating from the end of the 17th century. Apart from one small watch tower on the Singel nothing is left of the town's &lt;a href=\"city%20wall\"&gt;city wall&lt;/a&gt;s. Another former &lt;a href=\"fortification\"&gt;fortification&lt;/a&gt; is the \"Gravensteen\". Built as a &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; in the 13th century it has since served as house, library and prison. Presently it is one of the University's buildings.\nChurches.\nThe chief of Leiden's numerous churches are the &lt;a href=\"Hooglandse%20Kerk\"&gt;Hooglandse Kerk&lt;/a&gt; (or the church of &lt;a href=\"Pancras%20of%20Rome\"&gt;St Pancras&lt;/a&gt;, built in the 15th century and containing a monument to Pieter Adriaansz. van der Werff) and the \"&lt;a href=\"Pieterskerk%2C%20Leiden\"&gt;Pieterskerk&lt;/a&gt;\" (church of &lt;a href=\"St%20Peter\"&gt;St Peter&lt;/a&gt; (1315)) with monuments to &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Justus%20Scaliger\"&gt;Scaliger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boerhaave\"&gt;Boerhaave&lt;/a&gt; and other famous scholars. From a historical perspective the &lt;a href=\"Marekerk\"&gt;Marekerk&lt;/a&gt; is interesting too. &lt;a href=\"Arent%20van%20%27s%20Gravesande\"&gt;Arent van 's Gravesande&lt;/a&gt; designed that church in 1639. Other fine examples of his work in Leiden are in the \"&lt;a href=\"Stedelijk%20Museum%20De%20Lakenhal\"&gt;Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal&lt;/a&gt;\" (the municipal museum of fine arts), and the \"&lt;a href=\"Leiden%20University%20Library%23Bibliotheca%20Thysiana\"&gt;Bibliotheca Thysiana&lt;/a&gt;\". The growing city needed another church and the &lt;a href=\"Marekerk\"&gt;Marekerk&lt;/a&gt; was the first Protestant church to be built in Leiden (and in Holland) after the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt;. It is an example of &lt;a href=\"Classicism\"&gt;Dutch Classicism&lt;/a&gt;. In the drawings by Van 's Gravesande the &lt;a href=\"pulpit\"&gt;pulpit&lt;/a&gt; is the centrepiece of the church. The pulpit is modelled after the one in the \"&lt;a href=\"Nieuwe%20Kerk%20%28Haarlem%29\"&gt;Nieuwe Kerk&lt;/a&gt;\" at Haarlem (designed by &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20van%20Campen\"&gt;Jacob van Campen&lt;/a&gt;). The building was first used in 1650, and is still in use. The &lt;a href=\"Heilige%20Lodewijkkerk\"&gt;Heilige Lodewijkkerk&lt;/a&gt; is first catholic church in Leiden that was built after the Reformation. This church was given to the Catholics after the gunpowder explosion in 1807, which killed 150 inhabitants and destroyed a large part of the city centre. The 'Waalse Kerk' (Breestraat 63) was originally part of the Katharina Hospital. In 1584 it became the church of Protestant refugees from the Southern Netherlands (Brugge) and France. Later churches in the centre include the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Joseph%2C%20Leiden\"&gt;St. Joseph&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"expressionism\"&gt;expressionistic&lt;/a&gt; style.\nUniversity buildings.\nThe city centre contains many buildings that are in use by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Leiden\"&gt;University of Leiden&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Academy Building\" is housed in a former 16th-century &lt;a href=\"convent\"&gt;convent&lt;/a&gt;. Among the institutions connected with the university are the national institution for East Indian languages, &lt;a href=\"ethnology\"&gt;ethnology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"geography\"&gt;geography&lt;/a&gt;; the botanical gardens, founded in 1587; the &lt;a href=\"Leiden%20Observatory\"&gt;observatory&lt;/a&gt; (1860); the museum of antiquities (\"&lt;a href=\"Rijksmuseum%20van%20Oudheden\"&gt;Rijksmuseum van Oudheden&lt;/a&gt;\"); and the &lt;a href=\"ethnography\"&gt;ethnographical&lt;/a&gt; museum, of which &lt;a href=\"Philipp%20Franz%20von%20Siebold\"&gt;P.F. von Siebold's&lt;/a&gt; Japanese collection was the nucleus (\"&lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Ethnology%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde&lt;/a&gt;\"). This collection is now housed in a separate museum called the \"&lt;a href=\"SieboldHuis\"&gt;SieboldHuis&lt;/a&gt;\". The Bibliotheca Thysiana occupies an old &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; building of the year 1655. It is especially rich in legal works and &lt;a href=\"vernacular\"&gt;vernacular&lt;/a&gt; chronicles. Noteworthy are also the many special collections at &lt;a href=\"Leiden%20University%20Library\"&gt;Leiden University Library&lt;/a&gt; among which those of the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Dutch%20Literature\"&gt;Society of Dutch Literature&lt;/a&gt; (1766) and the collection of casts and engravings. In recent years the university has built the &lt;a href=\"Leiden%20Bio%20Science%20Park\"&gt;Leiden Bio Science Park&lt;/a&gt; at the city's outskirts to accommodate the Science departments. \nPublic transport.\nBus transport in Leiden is provided by &lt;a href=\"Arriva\"&gt;Arriva&lt;/a&gt;.\nRailway stations within the municipality of Leiden are:\nNotable inhabitants.\nThe following is a selection of important \"Leidenaren\" throughout history:\nInternational relations.\nTwin cities \u2013 sister cities.\nLeiden is &lt;a href=\"Sister%20city\"&gt;twinned&lt;/a&gt; with:"
