They have two daughters and five grandchildren.\nResearch.\nGuy Stroumsa's research focuses on the dynamics of encounters between religious traditions and institutions in the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Late%20Antiquity\"&gt;Late Antiquity&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;. He has studied the crystallization of the Abrahamic traditions in late antiquity, as a background to Islam. He sees &lt;a href=\"Gnosis\"&gt;Gnosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Manichaeism\"&gt;Manichaeism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Early%20Christianity\"&gt;Early Christianity&lt;/a&gt; as a unique laboratory for understanding religious transformations in late antiquity. In his doctoral dissertation, Stroumsa studied the development of Gnostic mythology, and demonstrated its roots in &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"biblical\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; interpretation. In his studies, Stroumsa seeks to cross traditional interdisciplinary boundaries in order to study religious phenomena from a comparative perspective. This approach permits him to understand the mechanisms behind the religious revolution of Late Antiquity, a period which saw the cessation of a number of widespread aspects of ancient religion (such as &lt;a href=\"blood%20sacrifice\"&gt;blood sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;) and the development of new systems, which stand at the basis of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\nStroumsa also works on the history of scholarship on religion, from early modern times to the twentieth century.\nStroumsa is the author of fourteen books, and the editor or co-editor of some twenty books. He has published more than a hundred and thirty articles.\nWorks.\nBooks.\n14.
