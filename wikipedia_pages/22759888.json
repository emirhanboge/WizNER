    "title": "Packing in a hypergraph",
    "text": "In mathematics, a packing in a hypergraph is a &lt;a href=\"Partition%20of%20a%20set\"&gt;partition&lt;/a&gt; of the set of the &lt;a href=\"hypergraph\"&gt;hypergraph&lt;/a&gt;'s edges into a number of disjoint subsets such that no pair of edges in each subset share any vertex. There are two famous algorithms to achieve asymptotically &lt;a href=\"optimal%20packing\"&gt;optimal packing&lt;/a&gt; in \"k\"-uniform hypergraphs. One of them is a random &lt;a href=\"greedy%20algorithm\"&gt;greedy algorithm&lt;/a&gt; which was proposed by &lt;a href=\"Joel%20Spencer\"&gt;Joel Spencer&lt;/a&gt;. He used a &lt;a href=\"branching%20process\"&gt;branching process&lt;/a&gt; to formally prove the optimal achievable bound under some side conditions. The other algorithm is called the R\u00f6dl nibble and was proposed by &lt;a href=\"Vojt%C4%9Bch%20R%C3%B6dl\"&gt;Vojt\u011bch R\u00f6dl&lt;/a&gt; et al. They showed that the achievable packing by the R\u00f6dl nibble is in some sense close to that of the random greedy algorithm.\nHistory.\nThe problem of finding the number of such subsets in a \"k\"-uniform &lt;a href=\"hypergraph\"&gt;hypergraph&lt;/a&gt; was originally motivated through a conjecture by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Erd%C5%91s\"&gt;Paul Erd\u0151s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haim%20Hanani\"&gt;Haim Hanani&lt;/a&gt; in 1963. &lt;a href=\"Vojt%C4%9Bch%20R%C3%B6dl\"&gt;Vojt\u011bch R\u00f6dl&lt;/a&gt; proved their conjecture asymptotically under certain conditions in 1985. Pippenger and &lt;a href=\"Joel%20Spencer\"&gt;Joel Spencer&lt;/a&gt; generalized R\u00f6dl's results using a random &lt;a href=\"greedy%20algorithm\"&gt;greedy algorithm&lt;/a&gt; in 1989.\nDefinition and terminology.\nIn the following definitions, the &lt;a href=\"hypergraph\"&gt;hypergraph&lt;/a&gt; is denoted by \"H\"=(\"V\",\"E\"). \"H\" is called a \"k\"-uniform hypergraph if every edge in \"E\" consists of exactly \"k\" vertices.\nformula_1 is a hypergraph packing if it is a subset of edges in H such that there is no pair of distinct edges with a common vertex.\nformula_2 is a (formula_3,formula_4)-good hypergraph if there exists a formula_3 such that for all formula_6 and formula_7 and both of the following conditions hold.\nwhere the \"degree\" formula_10 of a vertex formula_11 is the number of edges that contain formula_11 and the \"codegree\" formula_13 of two distinct vertices formula_11 and formula_15 is the number of edges that contain both vertices.\nTheorem.\nThere exists an asymptotic packing \"P\" of size at least formula_16 for a formula_17-uniform hypergraph under the following two conditions,\nwhere formula_21 is the total number of vertices. This result was shown by Pippenger and was later proved by Joel Spencer. To address the asymptotic hypergraph packing problem, Joel Spencer proposed a random greedy algorithm. In this algorithm, a branching process is used as the basis and it was shown that it almost always achieves an asymptotically optimal packing under the above side conditions.\nAsymptotic packing algorithms.\nThere are two famous algorithms for asymptotic packing of k-uniform hypergraphs: the random greedy algorithm via branching process, and the R\u00f6dl nibble.\nRandom greedy algorithm via branching process.\nEvery edge formula_22 is independently and uniformly assigned a distinct real \"birthtime\" formula_23. The edges are taken one by one in the order of their birthtimes. The edge formula_24 is accepted and included in formula_1 if it does not overlap any previously accepted edges. Obviously, the subset formula_1 is a packing and it can be shown that its size is formula_27 almost surely. To show that, let stop the process of adding new edges at time formula_28. For an arbitrary formula_29, pick formula_30 such that for any formula_31-good hypergraph formula_32 where formula_33 denotes the probability of vertex formula_11 survival (a vertex survives if it is not in any edges in formula_1) until time formula_28. Obviously, in such a situation the expected number of formula_11 surviving at time formula_28 is less than formula_39. As a result, the probability of formula_11 surviving being less than formula_41 is higher than formula_42. In other words, formula_43 must include at least formula_44 vertices which means that formula_45. \nTo complete the proof, it must be shown that formula_46. For that, the asymptotic behavior of formula_11 surviving is modeled by a continuous branching process. Fix formula_48 and begin with Eve with the birthdate of formula_28. Assume time goes backward so Eve gives birth in the interval of formula_50 with a unit density &lt;a href=\"Poisson%20distribution\"&gt;Poisson distribution&lt;/a&gt;. The probability of Eve having formula_51 birth is formula_52. By conditioning on formula_51 the birthtimes formula_54 are independently and uniformly distributed on formula_50. Every birth given by Eve consists of formula_56 offspring all with the same birth time say formula_57. The process is iterated for each offspring. It can be shown that for all formula_58 there exists a formula_59 so that with a probability higher than formula_60, Eve has at most formula_59 descendants.\nA rooted tree with the notions of parent, child, root, birthorder and wombmate shall be called a broodtree. Given a finite broodtree formula_62 we say for each vertex that it survives or dies. A childless vertex survives. A vertex dies if and only if it has at least one brood all of whom survive. Let formula_63 denote the probability that Eve survives in the broodtree formula_64 given by the above process. The objective is to show formula_65 and then for any fixed formula_28, it can be shown that formula_67. These two relations complete our argument.\nTo show formula_68, let formula_69. For formula_70 small, formula_71 as, roughly, an Eve starting at time formula_72 might have a birth in time interval formula_73 all of whose children survive while Eve has no births in formula_74 all of whose children survive. Letting formula_75 yields the differential equation formula_76. The initial value formula_77 gives a unique solution formula_78. Note that indeed formula_79.\nTo prove formula_67, consider a procedure we call History which either aborts or produces a broodtree. History contains a set formula_64 of vertices, initially formula_82. formula_64 will have a broodtree structure with formula_11 the root. The formula_85 are either processed or unprocessed, formula_11 is initially unprocessed. To each formula_85 is assigned a birthtime formula_88, we initialize formula_89. History is to take an unprocessed formula_85 and process it as follows. For the value of all formula_91 with formula_92 but with no formula_93 that has already been processed, if either some formula_24 has formula_95 and formula_96 with formula_97 or some formula_98 have formula_99 with formula_100 and formula_101, then History is aborted. Otherwise for each formula_24 with formula_95 add all formula_104 to formula_64 as wombmates with parent formula_15 and common birthdate formula_91. Now formula_15 is considered processed. History halts, if not aborted, when all formula_85 are processed. If History does not abort then root formula_11 survives broodtree formula_64 if and only if formula_11 survives at time formula_28. For a fixed broodtree, let formula_114 denote the probability that the branching process yields broodtree formula_64. Then the probability that History does not abort is formula_114. By the finiteness of the branching process, formula_117, the summation over all broodtrees formula_64 and History does not abort. The formula_119 distribution of its broodtree approaches the branching process distribution. Thus formula_67.\nThe R\u00f6dl nibble.\nIn 1985, R\u00f6dl proved &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Erd%C5%91s\"&gt;Paul Erd\u0151s&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s conjecture by a method called the R\u00f6dl nibble. R\u00f6dl's result can be formulated in form of either packing or covering problem. For formula_121 the covering number denoted by formula_122 shows the minimal size of a family formula_123 of k-element subsets of formula_124 which have the property that every l-element set is contained in at least one formula_125. &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Erd%C5%91s\"&gt;Paul Erd\u0151s&lt;/a&gt; et al. conjecture was \nwhere formula_127. This conjecture roughly means that a tactical configuration is asymptotically achievable. One may similarly define the packing number formula_128 as the maximal size of a family formula_123 of k-element subsets of formula_124 having the property that every l-element set is contained in at most one formula_125.\nPacking under the stronger condition.\nIn 1997, &lt;a href=\"Noga%20Alon\"&gt;Noga Alon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jeong%20Han%20Kim\"&gt;Jeong Han Kim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Joel%20Spencer\"&gt;Joel Spencer&lt;/a&gt; also supply a good bound for formula_132 under the stronger codegree condition that every distinct pair formula_133 has at most one edge in common. \nFor a \"k\"-uniform, \"D\"-regular hypergraph on \"n\" vertices, if \"k\" &gt; 3, there exists a packing \"P\" covering all vertices but at most formula_134. If \"k\" = 3 there exists a packing \"P\" covering all vertices but at most formula_135.\nThis bound is desirable in various applications, such as &lt;a href=\"Steiner%20triple%20system\"&gt;Steiner triple system&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Steiner Triple System is a 3-uniform, simple hypergraph in which every pair of vertices is contained in precisely one edge. Since a Steiner Triple System is clearly \"d\"=(\"n\"-1)/2-regular, the above bound supplies the following asymptotic improvement.\nAny Steiner Triple System on \"n\" vertices contains a packing covering all vertices but at most formula_136."
