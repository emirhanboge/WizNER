    "text": "Autism is a &lt;a href=\"neurodevelopmental%20disorder\"&gt;neurodevelopmental disorder&lt;/a&gt; characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some autistic children experience &lt;a href=\"Regressive%20autism\"&gt;regression&lt;/a&gt; in their communication and social skills after reaching &lt;a href=\"developmental%20milestones\"&gt;developmental milestones&lt;/a&gt; at a normal pace.\nAutism is associated with a combination of &lt;a href=\"Heritability%20of%20autism\"&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"environmental%20factors\"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt;. Risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections, such as &lt;a href=\"rubella\"&gt;rubella&lt;/a&gt;, toxins including &lt;a href=\"valproic%20acid\"&gt;valproic acid&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol, &lt;a href=\"cocaine\"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pesticides\"&gt;pesticides&lt;/a&gt;, lead, and air pollution, &lt;a href=\"fetal%20growth%20restriction\"&gt;fetal growth restriction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"autoimmune%20disease\"&gt;autoimmune disease&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Controversies%20in%20autism\"&gt;Controversies&lt;/a&gt; surround other proposed environmental &lt;a href=\"Causes%20of%20autism\"&gt;causes&lt;/a&gt;; for example, the &lt;a href=\"MMR%20vaccine%20and%20autism\"&gt;vaccine hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, which has been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain and how &lt;a href=\"nerve%20cell\"&gt;nerve cell&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"synapse\"&gt;synapse&lt;/a&gt;s connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. The &lt;a href=\"Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders\"&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/a&gt; (DSM-5) combines forms of the condition, including &lt;a href=\"Asperger%20syndrome\"&gt;Asperger syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pervasive%20developmental%20disorder%20not%20otherwise%20specified\"&gt;pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified&lt;/a&gt; (PDD-NOS) into the diagnosis of &lt;a href=\"autism%20spectrum%20disorder\"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ASD).\nSeveral interventions have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve the ability of autistic people to function and participate independently in the community. Behavioral, psychological, education, and/or skill-building interventions may be used to assist autistic people to learn life skills necessary for living independently, as well as other social, communication, and language skills. Therapy also aims to reduce challenging behaviors and build upon strengths. Some autistic adults are unable to live independently. An &lt;a href=\"Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism\"&gt;autistic culture&lt;/a&gt; has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be &lt;a href=\"Autism%20rights%20movement\"&gt;accepted as a difference&lt;/a&gt; to be accommodated instead of cured.\nGlobally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people . In the 2000s, the number of autistic people worldwide was estimated at 1\u20132 per 1,000 people. In the developed countries, about 1.5% of children are diagnosed with ASD , from 0.7% in 2000 in the United States. It is diagnosed four to five times more often in males than females. The number of people diagnosed has increased considerably since the 1990s, which may be partly due to increased recognition of the condition.\nCharacteristics.\nAutism is a highly variable &lt;a href=\"neurodevelopmental%20disorder\"&gt;neurodevelopmental disorder&lt;/a&gt; whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without &lt;a href=\"Remission%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;remission&lt;/a&gt;. Autistic people may be severely impaired in some respects but average, or even superior, in others. Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. It is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.\nSocial development.\nSocial deficits distinguish autism and the related &lt;a href=\"autism%20spectrum%20disorder\"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt;s (ASD; see &lt;a href=\"%23Classification\"&gt;Classification&lt;/a&gt;) from other developmental disorders. Autistic people have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Grandin\"&gt;Temple Grandin&lt;/a&gt; described her inability to understand the &lt;a href=\"social%20communication\"&gt;social communication&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"neurotypical\"&gt;neurotypical&lt;/a&gt;s, or people with typical &lt;a href=\"neural%20development\"&gt;neural development&lt;/a&gt;, as leaving her feeling \"like an anthropologist on Mars\".\nUnusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic &lt;a href=\"toddler\"&gt;toddler&lt;/a&gt;s differ more strikingly from &lt;a href=\"social%20norms\"&gt;social norms&lt;/a&gt;; for example, they have less &lt;a href=\"eye%20contact\"&gt;eye contact&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"turn-taking\"&gt;turn-taking&lt;/a&gt;, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate &lt;a href=\"nonverbal%20autism\"&gt;nonverbal&lt;/a&gt;ly, and take turns with others. However, they do form &lt;a href=\"Attachment%20%28psychology%29\"&gt;attachments&lt;/a&gt; to their primary caregivers. Most autistic children display moderately less &lt;a href=\"Attachment%20in%20children%23Secure%20attachment\"&gt;attachment security&lt;/a&gt; than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits. Older children and adults with ASD &lt;a href=\"Face%20perception%23Autism\"&gt;perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition&lt;/a&gt; although this may be partly due to a &lt;a href=\"alexithymia\"&gt;lower ability to define a person's own emotions&lt;/a&gt;.\nChildren with high-functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that autistic children prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for autistic people. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.\nThere are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns.\nCommunication.\nAbout one third to half of autistic people do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of &lt;a href=\"babbling\"&gt;babbling&lt;/a&gt;, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (&lt;a href=\"echolalia\"&gt;echolalia&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=\"Pronoun%20reversal\"&gt;reverse pronouns&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Joint%20attention\"&gt;Joint attention&lt;/a&gt; seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD. For example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the object to which the hand is pointing, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.\nIn a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8\u201315 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension, and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.\nRepetitive behavior.\nAutistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.\nNo single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.\nOther symptoms.\nAutistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.\nAn estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from &lt;a href=\"splinter%20skill\"&gt;splinter skill&lt;/a&gt;s such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious &lt;a href=\"Savant%20syndrome\"&gt;autistic savants&lt;/a&gt;. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. &lt;a href=\"Sensory%20system\"&gt;Sensory&lt;/a&gt; abnormalities are found in over 90% of autistic people, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60\u201380% of autistic people have motor signs that include &lt;a href=\"Hypotonia\"&gt;poor muscle tone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apraxia\"&gt;poor motor planning&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"toe%20walking\"&gt;toe walking&lt;/a&gt;; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper. Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur.\nThere is tentative evidence that &lt;a href=\"gender%20dysphoria\"&gt;gender dysphoria&lt;/a&gt; occurs more frequently in autistic people (see &lt;a href=\"Autism%20and%20LGBT%20identities\"&gt;Autism and LGBT identities&lt;/a&gt;). As well as that, a 2021 anonymized online survey of 16-90 year-olds revealed that autistic males are more likely to be bisexual, while autistic females are more likely to be homosexual.\n&lt;a href=\"Gastrointestinal%20diseases\"&gt;Gastrointestinal problems&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most commonly &lt;a href=\"Conditions%20comorbid%20to%20autism%20spectrum%20disorders\"&gt;co-occurring medical conditions&lt;/a&gt; in autistic people. These are linked to greater social impairment, irritability, behavior and sleep problems, language impairments and mood changes.\nParents of children with ASD have higher levels of &lt;a href=\"stress%20%28psychological%29\"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;. Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with &lt;a href=\"Down%20syndrome\"&gt;Down syndrome&lt;/a&gt; in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.\nCauses.\nIt has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.\nAutism has a strong genetic basis, although the &lt;a href=\"Heritability%20of%20autism\"&gt;genetics of autism&lt;/a&gt; are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare &lt;a href=\"mutation\"&gt;mutation&lt;/a&gt;s with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and &lt;a href=\"epigenetic\"&gt;epigenetic&lt;/a&gt; factors which do not change &lt;a href=\"DNA\"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; sequencing but are heritable and influence &lt;a href=\"gene%20expression\"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt;. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents. Studies of twins suggest that &lt;a href=\"heritability\"&gt;heritability&lt;/a&gt; is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a &lt;a href=\"Mendelian\"&gt;Mendelian&lt;/a&gt; (single-gene) mutation or to a single &lt;a href=\"chromosome%20abnormality\"&gt;chromosome abnormality&lt;/a&gt;, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous &lt;a href=\"structural%20variation\"&gt;structural variation&lt;/a&gt;\u2014such as &lt;a href=\"Deletion%20%28genetics%29\"&gt;deletions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gene%20duplication\"&gt;duplications&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chromosomal%20inversion\"&gt;inversions&lt;/a&gt; in genetic material during &lt;a href=\"meiosis\"&gt;meiosis&lt;/a&gt;. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. Autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition, but genetic phenomena such as &lt;a href=\"Genomic%20imprinting\"&gt;imprinting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"X%20linkage\"&gt;X linkage&lt;/a&gt; have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males, and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often, such as the &lt;a href=\"imprinted%20brain%20hypothesis\"&gt;imprinted brain hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"extreme%20male%20brain%20theory\"&gt;extreme male brain theory&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment. &lt;a href=\"Intrauterine%20growth%20restriction\"&gt;Intrauterine growth restriction&lt;/a&gt; is associated with ASD, in both term and preterm infants. Maternal inflammatory and &lt;a href=\"autoimmune%20disease\"&gt;autoimmune disease&lt;/a&gt;s may damage fetal tissues, aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system.\nExposure to air pollution during pregnancy, especially &lt;a href=\"heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;heavy metals&lt;/a&gt; and particulates, may increase the risk of autism. &lt;a href=\"Environmental%20factor\"&gt;Environmental factor&lt;/a&gt;s that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, &lt;a href=\"infectious%20disease\"&gt;infectious disease&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"solvent\"&gt;solvent&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Polychlorinated%20biphenyl\"&gt;PCBs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"phthalate\"&gt;phthalate&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"phenols\"&gt;phenols&lt;/a&gt; used in plastic products, &lt;a href=\"pesticide\"&gt;pesticide&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"brominated%20flame%20retardant\"&gt;brominated flame retardant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ethanol\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, &lt;a href=\"illicit%20drug\"&gt;illicit drug&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vaccine\"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"prenatal%20stress\"&gt;prenatal stress&lt;/a&gt;. Some, such as the MMR vaccine, have been completely disproven.\nParents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming &lt;a href=\"Vaccine%20controversy%23Vaccine%20overload\"&gt;vaccine \"overload\"&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Thiomersal%20controversy\"&gt;vaccine preservative&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"MMR%20vaccine%20and%20autism\"&gt;MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been \"an elaborate fraud\". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of &lt;a href=\"childhood%20immunizations\"&gt;childhood immunizations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MMR%20vaccine%20and%20autism%23Disease%20outbreaks\"&gt;outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases&lt;/a&gt; in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.\nMechanism.\nAutism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the &lt;a href=\"pathophysiology\"&gt;pathophysiology&lt;/a&gt; of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the &lt;a href=\"neuropsychological\"&gt;neuropsychological&lt;/a&gt; linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.\nThere is evidence that &lt;a href=\"gut%E2%80%93brain%20axis\"&gt;gut\u2013brain axis&lt;/a&gt; abnormalities may be involved. A 2015 review proposed that immune dysregulation, &lt;a href=\"gastrointestinal%20tract\"&gt;gastrointestinal&lt;/a&gt; inflammation, malfunction of the &lt;a href=\"autonomic%20nervous%20system\"&gt;autonomic nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gut%20flora\"&gt;gut flora&lt;/a&gt; alterations, and food &lt;a href=\"metabolite\"&gt;metabolite&lt;/a&gt;s may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction. A 2016 review concludes that &lt;a href=\"enteric%20nervous%20system\"&gt;enteric nervous system&lt;/a&gt; abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism. Neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain.\nSeveral lines of evidence point to &lt;a href=\"Synapse\"&gt;synaptic&lt;/a&gt; dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with &lt;a href=\"cell%20adhesion\"&gt;cell adhesion&lt;/a&gt;. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known &lt;a href=\"teratogen\"&gt;teratogen&lt;/a&gt;s (agents that cause &lt;a href=\"birth%20defect\"&gt;birth defect&lt;/a&gt;s) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from &lt;a href=\"Human%20fertilization\"&gt;conception&lt;/a&gt;, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.\nDiagnosis.\n&lt;a href=\"Medical%20diagnosis\"&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. Under the &lt;a href=\"DSM-5\"&gt;DSM-5&lt;/a&gt;, autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or &lt;a href=\"Idiosyncrasy%23Psychiatry%20and%20psychology\"&gt;idiosyncratic language&lt;/a&gt;, and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by &lt;a href=\"Rett%20syndrome\"&gt;Rett syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"intellectual%20disability\"&gt;intellectual disability&lt;/a&gt; or global developmental delay. &lt;a href=\"ICD-10\"&gt;ICD-10&lt;/a&gt; uses essentially the same definition.\nSeveral diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the &lt;a href=\"Autism%20Diagnostic%20Interview-Revised\"&gt;Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised&lt;/a&gt; (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the &lt;a href=\"Autism%20Diagnostic%20Observation%20Schedule\"&gt;Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule&lt;/a&gt; (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The &lt;a href=\"Childhood%20Autism%20Rating%20Scale\"&gt;Childhood Autism Rating Scale&lt;/a&gt; (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children. The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders (DISCO) may also be used.\nA &lt;a href=\"pediatrician\"&gt;pediatrician&lt;/a&gt; commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated &lt;a href=\"medical%20conditions\"&gt;medical conditions&lt;/a&gt;. A pediatric &lt;a href=\"neuropsychologist\"&gt;neuropsychologist&lt;/a&gt; is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A &lt;a href=\"differential%20diagnosis\"&gt;differential diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; for ASD at this stage might also consider &lt;a href=\"intellectual%20disability\"&gt;intellectual disability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hearing%20impairment\"&gt;hearing impairment&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"specific%20language%20impairment\"&gt;specific language impairment&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Landau%E2%80%93Kleffner%20syndrome\"&gt;Landau\u2013Kleffner syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as &lt;a href=\"Major%20depressive%20disorder\"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Clinical%20genetics\"&gt;Clinical genetics&lt;/a&gt; evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and &lt;a href=\"fragile%20X\"&gt;fragile X&lt;/a&gt; testing. A &lt;a href=\"Genotype-first%20approach\"&gt;genotype-first&lt;/a&gt; model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations. As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics. &lt;a href=\"Metabolic\"&gt;Metabolic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"neuroimaging\"&gt;neuroimaging&lt;/a&gt; tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.\nASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later. In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice. Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.\nSigns of autism may be more challenging for clinicians to detect in females. Autistic females have been shown to engage in masking more frequently than autistic males. Masking may include making oneself perform normative facial expressions and eye contact. A notable percentage of autistic females may be misdiagnosed, diagnosed after a considerable delay, or not diagnosed at all.\nConversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the &lt;a href=\"visually%20impaired\"&gt;visually impaired&lt;/a&gt;, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or &lt;a href=\"blindism\"&gt;blindism&lt;/a&gt;s.\nClassification.\nAutism is one of the five &lt;a href=\"pervasive%20developmental%20disorder\"&gt;pervasive developmental disorder&lt;/a&gt;s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, severely restricted interests, and highly repetitive behavior. These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.\nOf the five PDD forms, &lt;a href=\"Asperger%20syndrome\"&gt;Asperger syndrome&lt;/a&gt; is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; &lt;a href=\"Rett%20syndrome\"&gt;Rett syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder\"&gt;childhood disintegrative disorder&lt;/a&gt; share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; &lt;a href=\"PDD%20not%20otherwise%20specified\"&gt;PDD not otherwise specified&lt;/a&gt; (PDD-NOS; also called \"atypical autism\") is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in &lt;a href=\"language%20development\"&gt;language development&lt;/a&gt;. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the \"autism spectrum disorders\" (ASD) or sometimes the \"autistic disorders\", whereas autism itself is often called \"autistic disorder\", \"childhood autism\", or \"infantile autism\". In this article, \"autism\" refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, \"autism\", \"ASD\", and \"PDD\" are often used interchangeably. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism &lt;a href=\"phenotype\"&gt;phenotype&lt;/a&gt;, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like &lt;a href=\"Phenotypic%20trait\"&gt;traits&lt;/a&gt;, such as avoiding eye contact.\nResearch into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of &lt;a href=\"psychiatry\"&gt;psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"psychology\"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"neurology\"&gt;neurology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pediatrics\"&gt;pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;. Newer technologies such as &lt;a href=\"fMRI\"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"diffusion%20tensor%20imaging\"&gt;diffusion tensor imaging&lt;/a&gt; can help identify biologically relevant &lt;a href=\"phenotype\"&gt;phenotype&lt;/a&gt;s (observable traits) that can be viewed on &lt;a href=\"brain%20scan\"&gt;brain scan&lt;/a&gt;s, to help further &lt;a href=\"neurogenetic\"&gt;neurogenetic&lt;/a&gt; studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the &lt;a href=\"fusiform%20face%20area\"&gt;fusiform face area&lt;/a&gt; of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior. (For more, see &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Abrahams\"&gt;Brett Abrahams&lt;/a&gt;, geneticist and neuroscientist)\nSpectrum.\nAutism has long been thought to cover a wide &lt;a href=\"Spectrum%20disorder\"&gt;spectrum&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from individuals with severe impairments\u2014who may be silent, &lt;a href=\"developmentally%20disabled\"&gt;developmentally disabled&lt;/a&gt;, and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking\u2014to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, &lt;a href=\"pedantic\"&gt;pedantic&lt;/a&gt; communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.\nScreening.\nAbout half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months. According to an article, failure to meet any of the following milestones \"is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Preventive%20Services%20Task%20Force\"&gt;United States Preventive Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concern. The Japanese practice is to &lt;a href=\"Screening%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;screen&lt;/a&gt; all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective. Screening tools include the &lt;a href=\"Modified%20Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers\"&gt;Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers&lt;/a&gt; (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers\"&gt;Checklist for Autism in Toddlers&lt;/a&gt; (CHAT), on children aged 18\u201330 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low &lt;a href=\"Sensitivity%20%28tests%29\"&gt;sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; (many false-negatives) but good &lt;a href=\"Specificity%20%28tests%29\"&gt;specificity&lt;/a&gt; (few false-positives). It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders. Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. Although &lt;a href=\"genetic%20screening\"&gt;genetic screening&lt;/a&gt; for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and &lt;a href=\"dysmorphic%20feature\"&gt;dysmorphic feature&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSome authors suggest that automatic motor assessment could be useful to screen the children with ASD for instance with behavioural motor and emotionals reactions during smartphone watching.\nPrevention.\nWhile infection with &lt;a href=\"rubella\"&gt;rubella&lt;/a&gt; during pregnancy causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism, &lt;a href=\"rubella%20vaccine\"&gt;vaccination against rubella&lt;/a&gt; can prevent many of those cases.\nManagement.\nThe main goals when treating autistic children are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. Services should be carried out by &lt;a href=\"Professional%20practice%20of%20behavior%20analysis\"&gt;behavior analysts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"special%20education\"&gt;special education&lt;/a&gt; teachers, &lt;a href=\"speech%E2%80%93language%20pathology\"&gt;speech pathologists&lt;/a&gt;, and licensed &lt;a href=\"psychologists\"&gt;psychologists&lt;/a&gt;. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about &lt;a href=\"efficacy\"&gt;efficacy&lt;/a&gt;. However, the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years. Although many &lt;a href=\"psychosocial\"&gt;psychosocial&lt;/a&gt; interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of &lt;a href=\"systematic%20review\"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt;s of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained &lt;a href=\"special%20education\"&gt;special education&lt;/a&gt; programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, communication, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. While medications have not been found to help with core symptoms, they may be used for associated symptoms, such as irritability, inattention, or repetitive behavior patterns.\nEducation.\nEducational interventions often used include &lt;a href=\"applied%20behavior%20analysis\"&gt;applied behavior analysis&lt;/a&gt; (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, &lt;a href=\"speech%20and%20language%20therapy\"&gt;speech and language therapy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"social%20skills\"&gt;social skills&lt;/a&gt; therapy, and &lt;a href=\"occupational%20therapy\"&gt;occupational therapy&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive behavioral interventions in adults without intellectual disability to reduce depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit. The quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)\u2014a treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the &lt;a href=\"Discrete%20trial%20training\"&gt;structured type of ABA&lt;/a&gt; that is carried out with very young children\u2014is currently low, and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed. Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include &lt;a href=\"Discrete%20trial%20training\"&gt;structured&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pivotal%20response%20treatment\"&gt;naturalistic&lt;/a&gt; ABA interventions, and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP). One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment.\n&lt;a href=\"Discrete%20trial%20training\"&gt;Early, intensive ABA therapy&lt;/a&gt; has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children; it is also well-established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group. Similarly, a teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes a more &lt;a href=\"Pivotal%20response%20treatment\"&gt;naturalistic form of ABA&lt;/a&gt; combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social-communication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.\nMedication.\nMedications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. They may also be used for associated health problems, such as &lt;a href=\"ADHD\"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"anxiety%20disorder\"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed &lt;a href=\"psychoactive%20drug\"&gt;psychoactive drug&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"anticonvulsant\"&gt;anticonvulsant&lt;/a&gt;s, with the most common drug classes being &lt;a href=\"antidepressant\"&gt;antidepressant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stimulant\"&gt;stimulant&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"antipsychotic\"&gt;antipsychotic&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"atypical%20antipsychotic\"&gt;atypical antipsychotic&lt;/a&gt; drugs &lt;a href=\"risperidone\"&gt;risperidone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aripiprazole\"&gt;aripiprazole&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"FDA\"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;-approved for treating associated aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. However, their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and autistic people may respond atypically. Side effects, for example, may include weight gain, tiredness, drooling, and aggression. &lt;a href=\"SSRI\"&gt;SSRI&lt;/a&gt; antidepressants, such as &lt;a href=\"fluoxetine\"&gt;fluoxetine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fluvoxamine\"&gt;fluvoxamine&lt;/a&gt;, have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors, while the stimulant medication &lt;a href=\"methylphenidate\"&gt;methylphenidate&lt;/a&gt; is beneficial for some children with co-morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity. There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. No known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.\nAlternative medicine.\nAlthough many &lt;a href=\"Alternative%20therapies%20for%20developmental%20and%20learning%20disabilities\"&gt;alternative therapies and interventions&lt;/a&gt; are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Treatment approaches have little empirical support in &lt;a href=\"Quality%20of%20life\"&gt;quality-of-life&lt;/a&gt; contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. The preference that autistic children have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on &lt;a href=\"casein-free%20diet\"&gt;casein-free diet&lt;/a&gt;s, as a consequence of the low intake of &lt;a href=\"calcium\"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20D\"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;; however, suboptimal bone development in ASD has also been associated with lack of exercise and &lt;a href=\"gastrointestinal%20disease\"&gt;gastrointestinal disorders&lt;/a&gt;. In 2005, botched &lt;a href=\"chelation%20therapy\"&gt;chelation therapy&lt;/a&gt; killed a five-year-old child with autism. Chelation is not recommended for autistic people since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits. Another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is &lt;a href=\"CEASE%20therapy\"&gt;CEASE therapy&lt;/a&gt;, a mixture of &lt;a href=\"homeopathy\"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;, supplements, and 'vaccine detoxing'.\nAlthough popularly used as an &lt;a href=\"complementary%20and%20alternative%20medicine\"&gt;alternative treatment&lt;/a&gt; for autistic people, as of 2018 there is no good evidence to recommend a &lt;a href=\"gluten-free%2C%20casein-free%20diet\"&gt;gluten- and casein-free diet&lt;/a&gt; as a standard treatment. A 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism, such as those with known &lt;a href=\"food%20intolerance\"&gt;food intolerance&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"food%20allergy\"&gt;allergies&lt;/a&gt;, or with food intolerance markers. The authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten- and casein-free diet in children with ASD (4 in total). All of them compared gluten- and casein-free diet versus normal diet with a control group (2 double-blind randomized controlled trials, 1 double-blind crossover trial, 1 single-blind trial). In two of the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in ASD symptoms (efficacy rate 50%) was identified. In the other two studies, whose duration was 3 months, no significant effect was observed. The authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms. Other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet, small sample size, the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a &lt;a href=\"placebo\"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; effect. In the subset of people who have &lt;a href=\"non-celiac%20gluten%20sensitivity\"&gt;gluten sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; there is limited evidence that suggests that a &lt;a href=\"gluten-free%20diet\"&gt;gluten-free diet&lt;/a&gt; may improve some autistic behaviors.\nResults of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support &lt;a href=\"mindfulness\"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;-based interventions for improving mental health. This includes decreasing stress, anxiety, ruminating thoughts, anger, and aggression. There is tentative evidence that &lt;a href=\"music%20therapy\"&gt;music therapy&lt;/a&gt; may improve social interactions, verbal communication, and non-verbal communication skills. There has been early research looking at &lt;a href=\"Hyperbaric%20medicine\"&gt;hyperbaric treatment&lt;/a&gt;s in children with autism. Studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects.\nPrognosis.\nThere is no known cure for autism. The degree of symptoms can decrease, occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often this outcome happens; reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from 3% to 25%. Most autistic children acquire language by age five or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. Many autistic children lack &lt;a href=\"social%20support\"&gt;social support&lt;/a&gt;, future employment opportunities or &lt;a href=\"Self-determination%20theory\"&gt;self-determination&lt;/a&gt;. Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.\nFew high-quality studies address long-term &lt;a href=\"prognosis\"&gt;prognosis&lt;/a&gt;. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife. Acquiring language before age six, having an &lt;a href=\"IQ\"&gt;IQ&lt;/a&gt; above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; &lt;a href=\"independent%20living\"&gt;independent living&lt;/a&gt; is unlikely with severe autism.\nMany autistic people face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood. Compared to the general population autistic people are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job. About half of people in their 20s with autism are not employed.\nAutistic people tend to face increased stress levels related to psychosocial factors, such as stigma, which may increase the rates of mental health issues in the autistic population.\nEpidemiology.\nAs of 2007, &lt;a href=\"review\"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;s estimate a prevalence of 1\u20132 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD. A 2016 survey in the United States reported a rate of 25 per 1,000 children for ASD. Globally, autism affects an estimated 24.8 million people , while Asperger syndrome affects a further 37.2 million. In 2012, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Health%20Service\"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1%. Rates of &lt;a href=\"PDD-NOS\"&gt;PDD-NOS&lt;/a&gt;'s has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000. CDC estimates about 1 out of 59 (1.7%) for 2014, an increase from 1 out of every 68 children (1.5%) for 2010.\nIn the UK, from 1998 to 2018, the autism diagnoses increased by 787%. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness (particularly among women), though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward psychosocial factors and changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics. It has been established that vaccination is not a risk factor for autism and is not behind any increase in autism prevalence rates, if any change in the rate of autism exists at all.\nMales are at higher risk for ASD than females. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without. Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed.\nAlthough the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.\nSeveral other conditions are common in children with autism. They include:\nHistory.\nA few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The \"&lt;a href=\"Table%20Talk%20%28Luther%29\"&gt;Table Talk&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther\"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt;, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic. The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Blair%20of%20Borgue\"&gt;Hugh Blair of Borgue&lt;/a&gt;, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance. The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Boy%20of%20Aveyron\"&gt;Wild Boy of Aveyron&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"feral%20child\"&gt;feral child&lt;/a&gt; caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Marc%20Gaspard%20Itard\"&gt;Jean Itard&lt;/a&gt; treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"New%20Latin\"&gt;New Latin&lt;/a&gt; word \"autismus\" (English translation \"autism\") was coined by the &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20people\"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; psychiatrist &lt;a href=\"Eugen%20Bleuler\"&gt;Eugen Bleuler&lt;/a&gt; in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of &lt;a href=\"schizophrenia\"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;. He derived it from the Greek word \"aut\u00f3s\" (\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, meaning \"self\"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to \"autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance\". A Soviet child psychiatrist, &lt;a href=\"Grunya%20Sukhareva\"&gt;Grunya Sukhareva&lt;/a&gt;, described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925, and in German in 1926.\nClinical development and diagnoses.\nThe word \"autism\" first took its modern sense in 1938 when &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Asperger\"&gt;Hans Asperger&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vienna%20General%20Hospital\"&gt;Vienna University Hospital&lt;/a&gt; adopted Bleuler's terminology \"autistic psychopaths\" in a lecture in German about &lt;a href=\"child%20psychology\"&gt;child psychology&lt;/a&gt;. Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as &lt;a href=\"Asperger%20syndrome\"&gt;Asperger syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Kanner\"&gt;Leo Kanner&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital\"&gt;Johns Hopkins Hospital&lt;/a&gt; first used \"autism\" in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label \"early infantile autism\" in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably \"autistic aloneness\" and \"insistence on sameness\", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.\nKanner's reuse of \"autism\" led to decades of confused terminology like \"infantile schizophrenia\", and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to \"&lt;a href=\"refrigerator%20mother\"&gt;refrigerator mother&lt;/a&gt;s\". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.\nTerminology and distinction from schizophrenia.\nAs late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions. Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed, parents continue to feel &lt;a href=\"social%20stigma\"&gt;social stigma&lt;/a&gt; in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively, and many &lt;a href=\"primary%20care%20physician\"&gt;primary care physician&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"medical%20specialist\"&gt;medical specialist&lt;/a&gt;s express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.\nIt took until 1980 for the &lt;a href=\"Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders\"&gt;DSM-III&lt;/a&gt; to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the &lt;a href=\"DSM-III-R\"&gt;DSM-III-R&lt;/a&gt; provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the DSM-5 was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and CDD, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.\nThe Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. &lt;a href=\"Societal%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism\"&gt;Societal and cultural aspects of autism&lt;/a&gt; have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that &lt;a href=\"Autism%20Rights%20Movement\"&gt;autism is simply another way of being&lt;/a&gt;.\nSociety and culture.\nAn autistic culture has emerged, accompanied by the &lt;a href=\"autistic%20rights\"&gt;autistic rights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"neurodiversity\"&gt;neurodiversity&lt;/a&gt; movements. Events include &lt;a href=\"World%20Autism%20Awareness%20Day\"&gt;World Autism Awareness Day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Autism%20Sunday\"&gt;Autism Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Autistic%20Pride%20Day\"&gt;Autistic Pride Day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Autreat\"&gt;Autreat&lt;/a&gt;, and others. Social-science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about \"autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons\u00a0... and research on social movements.\" Many autistic individuals have been successful in their fields.\nAutism rights movement.\nThe &lt;a href=\"autism%20rights%20movement\"&gt;autism rights movement&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"social%20movement\"&gt;social movement&lt;/a&gt; within the context of &lt;a href=\"disability%20rights%20movement\"&gt;disability right&lt;/a&gt;s that emphasizes the concept of &lt;a href=\"neurodiversity\"&gt;neurodiversity&lt;/a&gt;, viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the &lt;a href=\"human%20brain\"&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt; rather than a disorder to be cured. The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism, and the recognition of the autistic community as a &lt;a href=\"minority%20group\"&gt;minority group&lt;/a&gt;. Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the &lt;a href=\"human%20genome\"&gt;human genome&lt;/a&gt;. This perspective is distinct from &lt;a href=\"fringe%20theories\"&gt;fringe theories&lt;/a&gt; that autism is caused by environmental factors such as &lt;a href=\"vaccine\"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt;s. A common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are \"&lt;a href=\"High-functioning%20autism\"&gt;high-functioning&lt;/a&gt;\" or have Asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of \"&lt;a href=\"Low-functioning%20autism\"&gt;low-functioning&lt;/a&gt;\" autistic people.\nEmployment.\nAbout half of autistic people are unemployed, and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed. Among those who find work, most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum. While employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision, experienced employers of autistic people give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees. A majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market. Some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children."
