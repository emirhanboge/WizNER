It is based in &lt;a href=\"Grindav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Grindav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt; in south-west &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, and currently plays in the &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Arvalsdeild%20karla%20%28football%29\"&gt;\u00darvalsdeild karla&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;top-tier men's football league in Iceland&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe club won its way slowly up the leagues, beginning in the third tier and spending some time there before promotion to the second tier and at last promotion to the &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Arvalsdeild\"&gt;first tier&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. The club established itself there, and for years was the only side in the top divisions to have never been relegated from any division. &lt;a href=\"Sigur%C3%B0ur%20J%C3%B3nsson%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Sigur\u00f0ur J\u00f3nsson&lt;/a&gt; was appointed manager before the 2006 season, after a successful period at V\u00edkingur. In that season, Grindav\u00edk got relegated for the first time in their history. In September 2006 with three rounds to go, Sigur\u00f0ur resigned as a manager and his assistants managers, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Fannberg%20Magn%C3%BAsson\"&gt;Magni Fannberg Magn\u00fasson&lt;/a&gt; and Milan Stef\u00e1n Jankovic took control. They made a draw against &lt;a href=\"Fimleikaf%C3%A9lag%20Hafnarfjar%C3%B0ar\"&gt;Fimleikaf\u00e9lag Hafnarfjar\u00f0ar&lt;/a&gt;, 1:1, in the last round, but it was clear before the game that they needed to win. On September 22, 2007, Grindav\u00edk won a promotion back to the &lt;a href=\"%C3%9Arvalsdeild\"&gt;\u00darvalsdeild&lt;/a&gt; after a 6\u20130 win over Reynir Sandger\u00f0i, with still one round unplayed. They managed to stay in the top league from 2008 until 2012, when they were again relegated to &lt;a href=\"1.%20deild%20karla%20%28football%29\"&gt;1. deild&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2013%201.%20deild%20karla\"&gt;2013 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2017%20%C3%9Arvalsdeild\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, Grindav\u00edk finished 5th in the \u00darvalsdeild. &lt;a href=\"Andri%20R%C3%BAnar%20Bjarnason\"&gt;Andri R\u00fanar Bjarnason&lt;/a&gt; finished as the league's top goalscorer and was named the player of the season.\nHonours.\n&lt;a href=\"Icelandic%20Men%27s%20Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Icelandic League Cup&lt;/a&gt;"
