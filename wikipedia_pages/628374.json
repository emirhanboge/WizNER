The station is owned by the &lt;a href=\"Hunt%20Valley%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Hunt Valley, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;\u2013based &lt;a href=\"Sinclair%20Broadcast%20Group\"&gt;Sinclair Broadcast Group&lt;/a&gt;, which also operates dual &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"The%20CW\"&gt;CW&lt;/a&gt; affiliate &lt;a href=\"WHAM-TV\"&gt;WHAM-TV&lt;/a&gt; (channel 13) under a &lt;a href=\"shared%20services\"&gt;shared services&lt;/a&gt; agreement (SSA) with owner &lt;a href=\"Deerfield%20Media\"&gt;Deerfield Media&lt;/a&gt;. Both stations share studios on West Henrietta Road (&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%2015\"&gt;NY 15&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Henrietta%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Henrietta&lt;/a&gt; (with a Rochester &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Postal%20Service\"&gt;mailing&lt;/a&gt; address), while WUHF's transmitter is located on Pinnacle Hill on the border between Rochester and &lt;a href=\"Brighton%2C%20Monroe%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWUHF began operations on January 27, 1980, as a general entertainment &lt;a href=\"Independent%20station%20%28North%20America%29\"&gt;independent station&lt;/a&gt; running &lt;a href=\"animated%20cartoon\"&gt;cartoons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sitcom\"&gt;sitcom&lt;/a&gt;s (classic and recent), &lt;a href=\"feature%20film\"&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29\"&gt;drama series&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"religious%20broadcasting\"&gt;religious programs&lt;/a&gt;. The station was owned by Malrite and the General Manager was Jerry Carr who was the former \"The Weather Outside\" personality. Apparently, by sheer coincidence, the station re-used a &lt;a href=\"call%20signs%20in%20North%20America\"&gt;call sign&lt;/a&gt; which was previously used by a different and unrelated station which operated on the same channel 31, albeit in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. The latter station had only used the WUHF calls for its first year of experimental operation (1961\u201362); it is now &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Television\"&gt;Ion Television&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"owned-and-operated%20station\"&gt;owned-and-operated station&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"WPXN-TV\"&gt;WPXN-TV&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1983, former underground &lt;a href=\"cartoon\"&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt;ist &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Bram\"&gt;Brian Bram&lt;/a&gt; produced and hosted \"All Night Live\", a program aired live from midnight to 7 in the morning on Fridays and Saturdays. Bram's show was a showcase for regional bands including Personal Effects, Cousin Al and the Relatives, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Silly%20Pillows\"&gt;The Degrads&lt;/a&gt;. On October 9, 1986, WUHF became a charter affiliate of Fox for Rochester and was branded as \"Fox 31\". Most of the religious shows were gone by then. However, WUHF was initially still programmed as an independent station since Fox would only air one program, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Late%20Show%20%281986%20talk%20show%29\"&gt;The Late Show&lt;/a&gt; Starring &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Rivers\"&gt;Joan Rivers&lt;/a&gt;\" until April 1987, and even then, would not present an entire week's worth of programming until 1993. In 1989, &lt;a href=\"Act%20III%20Broadcasting\"&gt;Act III Broadcasting&lt;/a&gt; bought the station from Malrite Communications Group.\nLater that year, Act III Broadcasting bought out &lt;a href=\"WUTV\"&gt;WUTV&lt;/a&gt; in nearby &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;. Because of a city-grade signal overlap (&lt;a href=\"Federal%20Communications%20Commission\"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FCC) rules normally prohibit one company from owning two stations with overlapping coverage, and the agency would not even consider a waiver until 2000), Act III applied for a cross-ownership waiver seeking that the two stations were to be co-owned. In a group deal, Abry would become the owner in 1994, through Sullivan Broadcasting. Act III tried to sell to a different company WUHF after only one year, but no buyer was found.\nBy 1998, it was controlled by Sinclair and was eventually sold to that company, as part of a group deal to purchase Sullivan. In the 1990s, classic sitcoms, movies, and drama shows made way for &lt;a href=\"talk%20show\"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"reality%20television\"&gt;reality&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"court%20show\"&gt;court show&lt;/a&gt;s. The station ended weekday airings of cartoons at the end of 2001 when Fox canceled its weekday kids block nationwide. In 1999, the station changed its branding to \"Fox Rochester\" although it adopted a \"Fox 31\" logo from 1999 to 2005. Its digital signal signed on-the-air in 2004 under a &lt;a href=\"special%20temporary%20authority\"&gt;special temporary authority&lt;/a&gt; from the FCC.\nIn August 2005, the Sinclair Broadcast Group entered into a shared services agreement with &lt;a href=\"Nexstar%20Media%20Group\"&gt;Nexstar Broadcasting Group&lt;/a&gt;, owner of &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; affiliate &lt;a href=\"WROC-TV\"&gt;WROC-TV&lt;/a&gt; (channel 8). Sinclair agreed to be the subordinate entity allowing Nexstar to control programming for WUHF. The station then moved from its studios on East Avenue (NY 96) in Rochester to WROC-TV's facilities.\nOn May 15, 2012, Sinclair and Fox agreed to a five-year extension to the network's affiliation agreement with Sinclair's 19 Fox stations, including WUHF, allowing them to continue carrying the network's programming through 2017.\nOn December 3, 2012, Sinclair announced it would acquire the non-FCC assets of &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; affiliate &lt;a href=\"WHAM-TV\"&gt;WHAM-TV&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Newport%20Television\"&gt;Newport Television&lt;/a&gt;, with the license and other FCC assets being transferred to Sinclair-affiliated &lt;a href=\"Deerfield%20Media\"&gt;Deerfield Media&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of 2013, WUHF terminated its SSA with Nexstar and re-located its operations to WHAM-TV's facilities in &lt;a href=\"Henrietta%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Henrietta&lt;/a&gt;.\nNewscasts.\nOn November 30, 1997, WUHF established its own news department and aired a nightly prime time newscast (originally \"Fox News First\"; later renamed as \"The Ten O'Clock News\") along with a Sunday night sports highlight show. In 2003, the station adopted Sinclair's centralized \"&lt;a href=\"News%20Central\"&gt;News Central&lt;/a&gt;\" format, which featured locally produced segments, and national segments and &lt;a href=\"Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; commentaries produced from Sinclair's studios in &lt;a href=\"Hunt%20Valley%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Hunt Valley, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter WUHF's operations were taken over by Nexstar, WUHF replaced \"News Central\" with the WROC-produced \"Fox First at 10\" on September 1, 2005. The newscast initially aired for a half-hour; it was later expanded to 45 minutes, with the rest of the hour filled by the sports news segment \"Sports Extra\".\nOn September 4, 2012, WROC-TV became the second Rochester area station to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in &lt;a href=\"High-definition%20television\"&gt;high definition&lt;/a&gt;. The 10\u00a0p.m. newscast on WUHF was included in the upgrade.\nOn January 1, 2014, WUHF's 10 p.m. newscast was taken over by new sister WHAM-TV. WUHF also began to air a morning newscast, \"Good Day Rochester\", from 7:00 to 9:00\u00a0a.m.\nTechnical information.\nSubchannels.\nThe station's digital signal is &lt;a href=\"Multiplex%20%28TV%29\"&gt;multiplexed&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn 2006, WUHF added &lt;a href=\"The%20Tube%20Music%20Network\"&gt;The Tube&lt;/a&gt; digital music video channel on a new second digital subchannel; the channel was removed when the network went out of business in 2007.\nAnalog-to-digital conversion.\nWUHF discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20high%20frequency\"&gt;UHF&lt;/a&gt; channel 31, on February 17, 2009, the original target date in which full-power television in the United States were to &lt;a href=\"Digital%20television%20transition%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;transition from analog to digital broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; under federal mandate (like most Sinclair stations and was replaced by a \"nightlight\" loop that ran until March 3). The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 28. Through the use of &lt;a href=\"Program%20and%20System%20Information%20Protocol\"&gt;PSIP&lt;/a&gt;, digital television receivers display the station's &lt;a href=\"virtual%20channel\"&gt;virtual channel&lt;/a&gt; as its former UHF analog channel 31.\nCable carriage in Canada.\nIn 1994, several cable systems in Canada started carrying WUHF via the &lt;a href=\"Shaw%20Broadcast%20Services\"&gt;Cancom&lt;/a&gt; communications satellite in out-of-&lt;a href=\"media%20market\"&gt;market&lt;/a&gt; areas where Fox was not otherwise available. However, it had been carried on cable in &lt;a href=\"Belleville%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Belleville, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; and other communities on the north shore of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ontario\"&gt;Lake Ontario&lt;/a&gt; since the 1980s. It was formerly carried by &lt;a href=\"Eastlink%20%28company%29\"&gt;Eastlink&lt;/a&gt; (in SD only) and on &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Aliant\"&gt;Bell Aliant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fibe%20%28Bell%20Aliant%29\"&gt;FibreOP TV&lt;/a&gt; (in both SD and HD) for viewers in &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Canada\"&gt;Atlantic Canada&lt;/a&gt; until late 2012 (January 30, 2013 in Eastlink's case), when it was replaced with &lt;a href=\"WFXT\"&gt;WFXT&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, a former Fox O&amp;O (now owned by &lt;a href=\"Cox%20Media%20Group\"&gt;Cox Media Group&lt;/a&gt;). The station is also carried in the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Islands\"&gt;Thousand Islands&lt;/a&gt; region of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Country%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;North Country&lt;/a&gt; in the town of &lt;a href=\"Hammond%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Hammond&lt;/a&gt; (via Citizens Cable TV) as well as in the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Manitoba\"&gt;Manitoba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/a&gt;. WUHF has been carried on satellite systems since 1996 and it is currently the only Rochester-based television station seen in Canada on the &lt;a href=\"Shaw%20Direct\"&gt;Shaw Direct&lt;/a&gt; satellite provider.\n&lt;a href=\"CF%20Cable\"&gt;CF Cable&lt;/a&gt; in the western suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; used to carry the station in 1995 but replaced it with sister station WUTV from Buffalo the following year. That station was carried on &lt;a href=\"Vid%C3%A9otron\"&gt;Vid\u00e9otron&lt;/a&gt; for cable systems outside the &lt;a href=\"West%20Island\"&gt;West Island&lt;/a&gt;. It was also the first Fox station carried on Montreal cable. However, the northern suburbs of that city (particularly &lt;a href=\"Saint-J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%2C%20Quebec\"&gt;Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me&lt;/a&gt;) still carry the station, even though in &lt;a href=\"Mont-Tremblant%2C%20Quebec\"&gt;Mont-Tremblant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WFFF-TV\"&gt;WFFF-TV&lt;/a&gt; along with other &lt;a href=\"Burlington%2C%20Vermont\"&gt;Burlington, Vermont&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Plattsburgh%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Plattsburgh, New York&lt;/a&gt; stations are seen there instead."
