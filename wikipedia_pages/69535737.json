Constructed in 1960, it held its first NASCAR race on July 30, 1961. Despite its short length, Bristol is among the most popular tracks on the NASCAR schedule because of its distinct features, which include extraordinarily steep banking, an all concrete surface, two &lt;a href=\"Pit%20stop\"&gt;pit roads&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"stadium\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt;-like seating. It has also been named one of the loudest NASCAR tracks.\nPractice.\nFirst practice.\nThe first practice session would occur on Friday, April 13, at 1:05 PM &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;, and would last for 50 minutes. &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Jones%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Brandon Jones&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Gibbs%20Racing\"&gt;Joe Gibbs Racing&lt;/a&gt; would set the fastest time in the session, with a time of 15.495 and an average speed of .\nSecond and final practice.\nThe second and final practice session, sometimes referred to as Happy Hour, would occur on Friday, April 13, at 3:05 PM &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;, and would last for 50 minutes. &lt;a href=\"Cole%20Custer\"&gt;Cole Custer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stewart-Haas%20Racing\"&gt;Stewart-Haas Racing&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Biagi-DenBeste%20Racing\"&gt;Biagi-DenBeste&lt;/a&gt; would set the fastest time in the session, with a time of 15.528 and an average speed of .\nQualifying.\nQualifying was held on Saturday, April 14, at 9:35 AM &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Bristol Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt; is under 2 miles (3.2 km), the qualifying system was a multi-car system that included three rounds. The first round was 15 minutes, where every driver would be able to set a lap within the 15 minutes. Then, the second round would consist of the fastest 24 cars in Round 1, and drivers would have 10 minutes to set a lap. Round 3 consisted of the fastest 12 drivers from Round 2, and the drivers would have 5 minutes to set a time. Whoever was fastest in Round 3 would win the pole.\n&lt;a href=\"Cole%20Custer\"&gt;Cole Custer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stewart-Haas%20Racing\"&gt;Stewart-Haas Racing&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Biagi-DenBeste%20Racing\"&gt;Biagi-DenBeste&lt;/a&gt; would win the pole, setting a time of 15.090 and an average speed of .\nOne driver would fail to qualify: &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Shepherd\"&gt;Morgan Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;.\nRace results.\nStage 1 Laps: 85\nStage 2 Laps: 85\nStage 3 Laps: 130"
