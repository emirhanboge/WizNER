    "text": "International Libertarian Solidarity was an international &lt;a href=\"Anarchism\"&gt;anarchist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"social%20network\"&gt;network&lt;/a&gt; with over 20 participating organizations from &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to their website, \"International Libertarian projects are open to anarchist, &lt;a href=\"anarcho-syndicalist\"&gt;anarcho-syndicalist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syndicalism\"&gt;revolutionary syndicalist&lt;/a&gt;, and clearly &lt;a href=\"Libertarian%20socialism\"&gt;anti-Statist&lt;/a&gt;, non-party aligned social organisations which run along libertarian principles\". The projects mostly consisted of supporting various practical initiatives in South America such as funding printshops and communal halls, and, more broadly, the struggle against &lt;a href=\"corporate%20globalization\"&gt;corporate globalization&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts creation was rejected by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Workers%20Association\"&gt;International Workers Association&lt;/a&gt;, who accused the initiators of being reformist and bearing confusion and division among anarchists.\nIts former website has since disappeared and the network is no longer active. Many of the anarchist political organizations that were members now co-operate in the Anarkismo.net project."
