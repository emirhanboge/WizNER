    "text": "Cheltenham Spa Malvern Road railway station was a station in the town of &lt;a href=\"Cheltenham\"&gt;Cheltenham&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe station was opened by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Western%20Railway\"&gt;Great Western Railway&lt;/a&gt; on 30 March 1908, as \"Cheltenham Malvern Road\". It was provided so that trains along the line to would not have to start and terminate at , which involved a reversal. The station took its name from the road to the north from which a long driveway provided the main means of public access. Unlike the other stations on the line, Malvern Road had a single &lt;a href=\"island%20platform\"&gt;island platform&lt;/a&gt;, long on the Up side and on the Down side, which was reached by means of a covered footbridge leading from the booking office. The platform served both main running lines, together with a &lt;a href=\"bay%20platform\"&gt;bay&lt;/a&gt; at the north end into which local branch &lt;a href=\"GWR%20steam%20rail%20motors\"&gt;railmotor&lt;/a&gt; services to and from reversed before returning to the &lt;a href=\"Cheltenham%20Spa%20St.%20James%20railway%20station\"&gt;St. James&lt;/a&gt; terminus, which was much closer to Cheltenham town centre. Malvern Road did not have a resident stationmaster, and it was placed under the responsibility of the St. James stationmaster who also took charge of and stations. Stone from the &lt;a href=\"Cleeve%20Hill%2C%20Gloucestershire\"&gt;Cleeve Hill&lt;/a&gt; quarries was used in the station buildings, while the platform &lt;a href=\"coping%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;copings&lt;/a&gt; were sourced from &lt;a href=\"Pontypridd\"&gt;Pontypridd&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegular through services from &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20Snow%20Hill%20railway%20station\"&gt;Birmingham Snow Hill&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"West%20of%20England\"&gt;West of England&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Stratford-upon-Avon%20railway%20station\"&gt;Stratford&lt;/a&gt; and Malvern Road commenced on 1 July 1908 upon the opening of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Warwickshire%20Line\"&gt;North Warwickshire Line&lt;/a&gt;. These services covered the distance in just over 2\u00bd hours, but did not run to St. James to which a connecting service was provided by Honeybourne locals or the services to and . By April 1910, &lt;a href=\"Cornishman%20%28train%29\"&gt;The Cornishman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"express%20train\"&gt;express&lt;/a&gt; was calling at Malvern Road as part of its &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Low%20Level%20railway%20station\"&gt;Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt; to service. The suspension of long-distance services for a period towards the end of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; led to the temporary closure of Malvern Road as an economy measure between 1 January 1917 and 7 July 1919. Not long after reopening, the station was renamed \"Cheltenham Spa Malvern Road\" on 1 February 1925.\nTo the west of Malvern Road lay several &lt;a href=\"rail%20siding\"&gt;loop sidings&lt;/a&gt; serving a two-road &lt;a href=\"Motive%20power%20depot\"&gt;engine shed&lt;/a&gt; and coaling stage. Access to these facilities was controlled by two &lt;a href=\"signal%20box\"&gt;signal box&lt;/a&gt;es - Malvern Road East to the north, and Malvern Road West to the south. The East box was opened on 15 July 1906 and had 49 levers; it had replaced the Bayshill signal box which had controlled access to a locomotive shed demolished when the line was extended to Honeybourne. The West box was open by June 1908 and had 37 levers; it replaced a temporary box dating from August 1906. The station saw very little goods traffic as most were handled at St. James; a 15-ton &lt;a href=\"Truck%20scale%23Rail%20weighbridge\"&gt;weighbridge&lt;/a&gt; was nevertheless provided in the yard.\nHigh-speed services between &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Temple%20Meads%20railway%20station\"&gt;Bristol Temple Meads&lt;/a&gt; and Birmingham on the &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20and%20Gloucester%20Railway\"&gt;Birmingham to Gloucester line&lt;/a&gt; led to a decline in traffic on the Honeybourne line which closed to local passenger services from 7 March 1960. Malvern Road closed on 3 January 1966 to goods and passengers. The Cheltenham to Honeybourne stretch remained open for passenger trains until 1968 and occasional freight traffic until 25 August 1976 when the derailment of a coal train at caused damage to the Down line which was considered uneconomic to repair. Malvern Road West Signal Box had closed on 5 June 1966, with the East Signal Box lasting until 3 November 1970.\nPresent day.\n, the site is now a housing estate of some 100 homes. A long-term goal of the &lt;a href=\"Gloucestershire%20Warwickshire%20Railway\"&gt;Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway&lt;/a&gt; is to extend their services towards the present station at &lt;a href=\"Cheltenham%20Spa%20railway%20station\"&gt;Cheltenham Spa (Lansdown)&lt;/a&gt; (with the intention of offering interchange with rail services on the &lt;a href=\"Cross%20Country%20Route\"&gt;Cross Country Route&lt;/a&gt;), which would involve passing the site of Malvern Road."
