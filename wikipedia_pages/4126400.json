    "text": "Otto Martins Gl\u00f3ria (9 January 1917 \u2013 4 September 1986) was a Brazilian &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; coach.\nCareer.\nGl\u00f3ria was born in &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil, but had his greatest successes with &lt;a href=\"S.L.%20Benfica\"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt; in Portugal, guiding the club to nine national trophies. With the &lt;a href=\"Nigeria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Nigeria national team&lt;/a&gt; he won the &lt;a href=\"1980%20African%20Cup%20of%20Nations\"&gt;1980 African Cup of Nations&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his first period with Benfica, the club was transformed to professional standards. Supported by president &lt;a href=\"Joaquim%20Ferreira%20Bogalho\"&gt;Joaquim Ferreira Bogalho&lt;/a&gt;, Gl\u00f3ria founded a home for the players and focused on recruiting players from the periphery of the Portuguese capital and also from the African overseas provinces. In these years between 1954 and 1959 the club won two &lt;a href=\"Primeira%20Liga\"&gt;leagues&lt;/a&gt; and three &lt;a href=\"Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn February 1962 he took on the reins of &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20Marseille\"&gt;Olympique Marseille&lt;/a&gt;. The club was then stuck in the second division and saw its aspirations to return to the first division endangered. In his four months with the club he did not lose a single match and achieved its objective.\nIn his second tenure with Benfica he had continuous success on the national level, winning two more championships and cups. He also led the club into the 1968 final of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Cup%20of%20Champions\"&gt;European Cup of Champions&lt;/a&gt; in London against &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;, which was lost 1\u20134.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1966 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in England he led the &lt;a href=\"Portugal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Portugal national team&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Eus%C3%A9bio\"&gt;Eus\u00e9bio&lt;/a&gt;, who became the tournament's top scorer, to the third place. In the process Portugal inflicted a 1\u20133 defeat on Gl\u00f3ria's home country Brazil. The official head coach of the Portuguese team was then &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20da%20Luz%20Afonso\"&gt;Manuel da Luz Afonso&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1979, he became with &lt;a href=\"Club%20de%20Regatas%20Vasco%20da%20Gama\"&gt;CR Vasco da Gama&lt;/a&gt; of Rio de Janeiro runner-up in the Brazilian championship, losing in the final 1\u20132 against &lt;a href=\"Sport%20Club%20Internacional\"&gt;SC Internacional Porto Alegre&lt;/a&gt;, which remained undefeated throughout the competition.\nIn the year thereafter he guided Nigeria through the &lt;a href=\"1980%20African%20Nations%20Cup\"&gt;1980 African Nations Cup&lt;/a&gt;, which the team won in the final in &lt;a href=\"Lagos\"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt; with 3\u20130 against &lt;a href=\"Algeria%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, and the Olympic Football Tournament 1980 in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. He left this position after poor performances at the &lt;a href=\"1982%20African%20Nations%20Cup\"&gt;1982&lt;/a&gt; campaign in Libya.\nGl\u00f3ria coached Portugal, in 1982, in qualifying matches for &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%201984\"&gt;UEFA Euro 1984&lt;/a&gt;, but resigned after a 0\u20134 defeat in a friendly match with &lt;a href=\"Brazil%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, the following year.\nManagerial honours.\nClub.\nBenfica\nSporting CP\nBelenenses\nPortuguesa\nInternational.\nPortugal\nNigeria"
