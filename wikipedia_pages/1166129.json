Two years later, he introduced a separate bill that would require companies with twenty or more employees to offer a savings or pension plan that all employees would automatically join (with the ability to opt out). The stated purpose of this bill, which was supported by the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Life%20and%20Health%20Insurance%20Association\"&gt;Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association&lt;/a&gt;, was to reduce the costs of such insurance plans compared with retail mutual funds.\nIn June 2014, Leal was appointed as the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Agriculture%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs%20%28Ontario%29\"&gt;Minister of Agriculture and Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/a&gt;."
