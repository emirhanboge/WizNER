    "text": "St Benedict's College is a &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20education\"&gt;secondary school&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Randalstown\"&gt;Randalstown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Antrim\"&gt;County Antrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. It is an 11-16 Catholic, all ability, co-educational college which mainly serves families from the parishes of &lt;a href=\"Randalstown\"&gt;Randalstown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Antrim%2C%20County%20Antrim\"&gt;Antrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe college is a result of the amalgamation of &lt;a href=\"St%20Malachy%27s%20High%20School%2C%20Antrim\"&gt;St Malachy's High School, Antrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St%20Olcan%27s%20High%20School\"&gt;St Olcan's High School&lt;/a&gt; in Randalstown. This was agreed in March 2006. The combined school was renamed as \"St Benedict's College\". St Malachy's High School was demolished and a rebuilding programme began on the St Olcan's site around the same time to develop new facilities."
