His career in the &lt;a href=\"Telugu%20cinema\"&gt;Telugu cinema&lt;/a&gt; spanned more than four decades. He was highly admired and cherished for his deep and thoughtful lyrics in Telugu songs. He was considered an inspiration by many lyricists.\nEarly life.\nVeturi was born to Chandrasekhar Sastry and Kamalamba in &lt;a href=\"Pedakallepalli\"&gt;Pedakallepalli&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Challapalli\"&gt;Challapalli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krishna%20district\"&gt;Krishna&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Telugu%20brahmin\"&gt;Telugu brahmin&lt;/a&gt; family. Veturi was a nephew of the Telugu Research Scholar &lt;a href=\"Veturi%20Prabhakara%20Sastri\"&gt;Veturi Prabhakara Sastri&lt;/a&gt;. His grandfather Veturi Sundara Sastry was also a poet.\nEducation.\nVeturi completed his schooling in Diviseema, &lt;a href=\"Jaggayyapeta\"&gt;Jaggayyapeta&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Vijayawada\"&gt;Vijayawada&lt;/a&gt; in Krishna district, and SSLC in his grandmother's village. Later, Veturi went to Chennai for his intermediate studies and came back to &lt;a href=\"Vijayawada\"&gt;Vijayawada&lt;/a&gt; where he completed his degree in S.R.R. Government College. He was a student of legendary &lt;a href=\"Viswanatha%20Satyanarayana\"&gt;Viswanatha Satyanarayana&lt;/a&gt; at this college.\nCareer as a journalist.\nVeturi joined \"&lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Prabha\"&gt;Andhra Prabha&lt;/a&gt;\" as a journalist in 1952, after his education. He learned the basics of editing a news &lt;a href=\"Article%20%28publishing%29\"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from his senior at &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Prabha\"&gt;Andhra Prabha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Narla%20Venkateswara%20Rao\"&gt;Narla Venkateswara Rao&lt;/a&gt;, whom he considers his first teacher. In 1959, he joined a weekly called &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Patrika\"&gt;Andhra Patrika&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Bapu%20%28director%29\"&gt;Bapu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mullapudi%20Venkata%20Ramana\"&gt;Mullapudi Venkata Ramana&lt;/a&gt; were his colleagues. He was the in-charge of the Cinema section at \"Andhra Patrika\". He also worked for the &lt;a href=\"Pradesh%20Congress%20Committee\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee&lt;/a&gt;'s official daily newspaper, called \"Andhra Janata\", as an editor.\nIn 1962, he became the first and only Telugu journalist to interview the then Prime Minister, &lt;a href=\"Jawaharlal%20Nehru\"&gt;Jawaharlal Nehru&lt;/a&gt;, who came to inaugurate &lt;a href=\"Srisailam%20Dam\"&gt;Srisailam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hydroelectricity\"&gt;Hydroelectricity&lt;/a&gt; project. He covered the speeches of national leaders like &lt;a href=\"Sarvepalli%20Radhakrishnan\"&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan&lt;/a&gt;. In 1964, he worked as an &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;assembly&lt;/a&gt; reporter.\nHis articles are said to be very catchy and witty. For instance, he referred to the meeting of &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20the%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;MLA&lt;/a&gt;'s in Hotel Dwaraka, near the &lt;a href=\"Andhra%20Pradesh%20State%20Assembly\"&gt;Andhra Pradesh State Assembly&lt;/a&gt; as \"Adigo Dwaraka- Evigo Alamandalu\" (\"This is Dwaraka and here are the cattle\") (). His writing style caught the attention of the film industry due to his prowess in using traditional poetic rules related to &lt;a href=\"alliteration\"&gt;alliteration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rhyme\"&gt;rhyme&lt;/a&gt; for describing &lt;a href=\"Current%20affairs%20%28news%20format%29\"&gt;current affairs&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer as a lyricist.\nEntry into films.\nVeturi had contacts with the &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20Andhra%20Pradesh\"&gt;Telugu film industry&lt;/a&gt; during his days as a journalist. He used to meet veteran &lt;a href=\"Lyricist\"&gt;lyric writer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daasaradhi%20Krishnamacharyulu\"&gt;Dasarathi&lt;/a&gt; often. Legendary director &lt;a href=\"Chittor%20V.%20Nagaiah\"&gt;Chittor V. Nagaiah&lt;/a&gt; offered him a role in his film, \"&lt;a href=\"Naa%20Illu\"&gt;Naa Illu&lt;/a&gt;\". However, two days before the shooting began, Veturi decided not to act as he felt that he was not fit for acting, and wrote a letter of apology to &lt;a href=\"Chittor%20V.%20Nagaiah\"&gt;Nagaiah&lt;/a&gt; for rejecting his offer. Sri.&lt;a href=\"N.T.%20Rama%20Rao\"&gt;N.T. Rama Rao&lt;/a&gt;, has invited him to join the film industry] as a lyricist. In 1974, he wrote his first song, \"Bharatanaari Charitamu\" (), in the form of &lt;a href=\"Harikatha\"&gt;Harikatha&lt;/a&gt;, for \"&lt;a href=\"O%20Seeta%20Katha\"&gt;O Seeta Katha&lt;/a&gt;\" under the direction of the legendary director, &lt;a href=\"K.%20Viswanath\"&gt;K Viswanath&lt;/a&gt;.\n1970s.\nIn 1977, actor &lt;a href=\"N.%20T.%20Rama%20Rao\"&gt;Sr. N.T.R&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Adavi%20Ramudu%20%281977%20film%29\"&gt;Adavi Ramudu&lt;/a&gt;\" showcased Veturi's talent for penning inspirational and romantic lyrics.

In 1978, &lt;a href=\"K.%20Viswanath\"&gt;K Viswanath&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Siri%20Siri%20Muvva\"&gt;Siri Siri Muvva&lt;/a&gt;\" proved his prowess in expressing diverse emotions with poetry. &lt;a href=\"Aatreya%20%28playwright%29\"&gt;Aathreya&lt;/a&gt;, the leading lyricist in those days, was known to take days for writing a song. Veturi became the first choice for directors and producers too because of his ability to write a song to the director's taste in a few minutes. He went on to pen more than 5,000 songs in his career. He wrote more mass numbers for movies like \"Vetagadu\" and \"Driver Ramudu\", and classics for movies like \"&lt;a href=\"Sankarabharanam%20%281980%20film%29\"&gt;Sankarabharanam&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Sagara%20Sangamam\"&gt;Sagara Sangamam&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, \"&lt;a href=\"Sankarabharanam%20%281980%20film%29\"&gt;Sankarabharanam&lt;/a&gt;\" stood as a landmark in the &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20Andhra%20Pradesh\"&gt;Telugu film industry&lt;/a&gt;.\n1980s.\nAfter the surge of his popularity during the 1970s, he went on to work with a variety of directors and actors in the 1980s.

However, Veturi still maintained his balance between classics and mass-numbers with movies like \"&lt;a href=\"Jagadeka%20Veerudu%20Atiloka%20Sundari\"&gt;Jagadeka Veerudu Atiloka Sundari&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Sarigamalu\", \"Sitaramayya Gaari Manavaralu\", \"&lt;a href=\"Matru%20Devo%20Bhava\"&gt;Matru Devo Bhava&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Mechanic%20Alludu\"&gt;Mechanic Alludu&lt;/a&gt;\". Veturi was given the opportunity to dub many &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20language\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malayalam\"&gt;Malayalam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hindi\"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt; movies.

In his book \"Kommakommako Sannayi\", he describes his relationship with some of the &lt;a href=\"Composer\"&gt;music directors&lt;/a&gt;, singers, lyricists, actors and directors he worked with. He was a teacher-like figure for many artists in the industry.\nMany people consider him the most complete lyricist in the history of &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20Andhra%20Pradesh\"&gt;Telugu cinema&lt;/a&gt;.

This is in reference to &lt;a href=\"Vamana\"&gt;Vamana&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Avatar\"&gt;Avatar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vishnu\"&gt;Vishnu&lt;/a&gt;.\nVeteran director &lt;a href=\"K.%20Viswanath\"&gt;K.
