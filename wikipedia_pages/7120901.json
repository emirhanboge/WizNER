It broadcasts on a frequency is 1116 &lt;a href=\"kHz\"&gt;kHz&lt;/a&gt; in the AM radio band and is simulcasted in &lt;a href=\"DAB%2B\"&gt;DAB+&lt;/a&gt; on channel 9B. It is owned by &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Entertainment%20Co\"&gt;Nine Entertainment Co&lt;/a&gt; and run under a lease agreement by &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Radio\"&gt;Ace Radio&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom Friday, October 8, 2021, 4BH moved to 1116 khz, formerly used by its sister station, 4BC, with that station moving to 882 khz, which 4BH used.\nHistory.\n4BH.\n4BH broadcasts from its &lt;a href=\"Cannon%20Hill%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Cannon Hill&lt;/a&gt; headquarters, and is the sister station of &lt;a href=\"4BC\"&gt;4BC&lt;/a&gt;. 4BH (transmitting from &lt;a href=\"Bald%20Hills%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Bald Hills&lt;/a&gt;) was opened by J. S. Kerr on 2 January 1932.\nDuring the 1960s, 4BH dominated Brisbane radio and, under the management of Norm Llewellyn, promoted itself as \"Top Dog Radio\" with a contemporary Top 40 music format. In the 1950s and 1960s &lt;a href=\"George%20Lovejoy\"&gt;George Lovejoy&lt;/a&gt; provided commentary on Brisbane &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; matches for the station and replaced Llewellyn as general manager. During the Lovejoy years, the station was branded a \"Happy Day Radio\". Lovejoy was replaced in 1975 by Warren Stagg. Some of the well known announcers were Ben Beckinsale, David Wildman, Russ Walkington, Ken Guy, Ken Smith, Peter Kay, John Flemming, Jimmy White, and John Kerr. With the emergence of 4IP into the marketplace with a similar Top 40 format, 4BH added talkback programmes led by Ivor Hancock and supported by a well-known lineup including Don Seccombe, Babette Stephens, Gabby Horan, Peter Clark, Jim Iliffe, Owen Delaney, Father Stephen Freshwater, Jennifer Blocksidge and Pat Thompson. Bob Ackery joined the station in the early 1970s and became the \"drive time\" announcer before moving into the \"breakfast\" slot, later taking on the role of programme manager and eventually general manager in the late 1980s. He took over from Barry Augustus, who led the station through one of its most successful periods through the late 1970s and 1980s. This included a frequency change from 1390\u00a0kHz to 880\u00a0kHz in the mid-1970s and from 880\u00a0kHz to 882\u00a0kHz on 23 November 1978, a relocation of the transmitter from Bald Hills to Wynnum West and a move from its old Adelaide Street home to purpose-built studios at Astor Terrace Spring Hill.\nIn 1988, the station was sold to a local consortium.\nIn 1975, 4BH started broadcasting \"Beautiful Music\", which became their focus except for a period in 1994 when the station converted to talk which was up against 4BH's now sister station 4BC and 612 4QR Brisbane. The station successfully bid for an FM license (conversion) in 1990 but was unable to afford the conversion. 4KQ was the second-highest bidder but also failed to produce the required money. In 1995, after the disastrous Talk format experiment, 4BH was placed in receivership and bought for just over $2 million by Michael Norris who was a Brisbane businessman and the major shareholder of Unitel and the Ipswich and West Moreton Broadcasting Corp. 4BH was relocated from &lt;a href=\"Spring%20Hill%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Spring Hill&lt;/a&gt; to shared studios at the 106.9 QFM building in &lt;a href=\"North%20Ipswich%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;North Ipswich&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"River%2094.9\"&gt;River 94.9&lt;/a&gt;).\nBetween 1995 and 1997, 4BH returned to the top two ratings position. In January 1997 Michael Norris sold 4BH to the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Radio%20Network\"&gt;Australian Radio Network&lt;/a&gt; (owners of 4KQ) for over $11.5 million, who owned 4BH until January 2002 after ARN and &lt;a href=\"DMG%20Radio%20Australia\"&gt;DMG Radio Australia&lt;/a&gt; jointly launched &lt;a href=\"97.3%20FM%20%28Brisbane%29\"&gt;97.3 FM&lt;/a&gt;, so ARN sold 4BH to DMG and in February 2003, 4BH was sold yet again to &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Cross%20Broadcasting\"&gt;Southern Cross Broadcasting&lt;/a&gt; because DMG had won an auction to set up an FM service on the Sunshine Coast.\nIn August 2002, the station's &lt;a href=\"Antenna%20%28radio%29\"&gt;transmitting antenna&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wynnum%20West%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Wynnum West&lt;/a&gt; was felled by vandals, causing the station to go off air. The station returned to air a few days later on low power. Two teenagers were eventually charged and pleaded guilty. It later emerged that the reason for the attack was due to a dislike of the transmitter site and also of the station's music.\nIn 2004, the station moved to new purpose built premises at &lt;a href=\"Cannon%20Hill%2C%20Queensland\"&gt;Cannon Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\n4BH 882 celebrated 75 years of broadcasting in May 2007. A Gala Dinner was hosted at the Sofitel Hotel in Brisbane, the event was attended by former announcers and guests\nSince November 2007, 4BH, and all Southern Cross Broadcasting radio stations, has been owned by &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%20Media\"&gt;Fairfax Media&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagic 882.\nOn 13 January 2014, 4BH rebranded itself as Magic 882, with a new positioner of \"The songs you know and love\". The rebrand came with changes to the on-air lineup \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Moyd%20Kay\"&gt;Moyd Kay&lt;/a&gt; moved from afternoons at sister 4BC to breakfast at Magic; &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Keenan\"&gt;Ian Keenan&lt;/a&gt; joined the team from rival &lt;a href=\"4KQ\"&gt;4KQ&lt;/a&gt; into mornings; and &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Victor\"&gt;Greg Victor&lt;/a&gt; moving from mornings to drive.\nIn November 2015, it was announced that the station would begin taking network programming from sister station &lt;a href=\"Magic%201278\"&gt;Magic 1278&lt;/a&gt; in Melbourne. The stations on-air presenters and a number of administration staff were made redundant.\nTalking Lifestyle 882.\nIn February 2017, the &lt;a href=\"Macquarie%20Radio%20Network\"&gt;Macquarie Radio Network&lt;/a&gt; announced that Magic 882 would be relaunched as Talking Lifestyle from Monday 27 February. The launch of Talking Lifestyle into the Melbourne and Brisbane markets followed 18 months of development by Macquarie Media and a soft launch in the Sydney market, from September 2016. Presenters for the station broadcast from either Sydney or Melbourne. The on-air line-up included Ed Phillips, Catriona Rowntree, Nick Bennett, Dee Dee Dunleavy and Sabina Read.\nMacquarie Sports Radio.\nOn Wednesday April 4, 2018, the three Talking Lifestyle branded stations relaunched with a new &lt;a href=\"sports%20radio\"&gt;sports radio&lt;/a&gt; format under the name Macquarie Sports Radio with coverage of the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;2018 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;.
