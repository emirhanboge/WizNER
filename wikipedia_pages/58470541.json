    "text": "Adri\u00e0 Arjona Mar\u00edn (born 28 February 1996) is a Spanish &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; who plays for &lt;a href=\"Recreativo%20de%20Huelva\"&gt;Recreativo de Huelva&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Midfielder%23Winger\"&gt;winger&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Vila-seca\"&gt;Vila-seca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Tarragona\"&gt;Tarragona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalonia&lt;/a&gt;, Arjona joined &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"La%20Masia\"&gt;La Masia&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, from CF Vilaseca. Released in 2009, he spent three seasons at &lt;a href=\"Gimn%C3%A0stic%20de%20Tarragona\"&gt;Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona&lt;/a&gt; before returning to \"Bar\u00e7a\" in 2012.\nOn 23 August 2015, after finishing his formation, Arjona joined &lt;a href=\"CF%20Reus%20Deportiu\"&gt;CF Reus Deportiu&lt;/a&gt; and was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"farm%20team\"&gt;farm team&lt;/a&gt; CD Morell in &lt;a href=\"Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Tercera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. On 17 August of the following year, he was loaned to fellow league team &lt;a href=\"UE%20Sant%20Andreu\"&gt;UE Sant Andreu&lt;/a&gt; for a year.\nUpon returning, Arjona was assigned to &lt;a href=\"CF%20Reus%20Deportiu%20B\"&gt;the B-team&lt;/a&gt;, now also in the fourth division. He made his first-team debut on 12 September, starting in a 2\u20131 away win against &lt;a href=\"CA%20Osasuna\"&gt;CA Osasuna&lt;/a&gt;, for &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;the season&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Copa%20del%20Rey\"&gt;Copa del Rey&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 18 July 2019, Arjona signed for &lt;a href=\"AE%20Prat\"&gt;AE Prat&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B\"&gt;Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B&lt;/a&gt;, after Reus fell into severe economic problems.\nIn the summer of 2020, he joined &lt;a href=\"CD%20Llosetense\"&gt;CD Llosetense&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Tercera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, in the midst of the club's projects of professional and managerial development. During the following winter transfer window, after just eight appearances with the Balearic club, Arjona decided to start his first journey overseas, as he was set to sign for South Korean team &lt;a href=\"Gimpo%20FC\"&gt;Gimpo FC&lt;/a&gt;, playing in the semi-professional &lt;a href=\"K3%20League\"&gt;K3 League&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the Spanish player got involved in a bureaucratic incident: in fact, despite having signed a pre-contract with the club and having sustained medicals, Arjona was eventually told by Gimpo's staff that, following a reunion with the &lt;a href=\"Gimpo\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;'s mayor and the club's chairman, they couldn't take care of him anymore. Even though the club offered to help him find a new club in the country, the task wasn't successful, and Arjona eventually decided to fly back to Spain, reportedly \"disappointed\" by what happened to him, but also convinced that \"nothing and no one would take his will to succeed as a professional football from him\".\nOn February 23, 2021, Arjona officially announced that he joined &lt;a href=\"SD%20Huesca\"&gt;SD Huesca&lt;/a&gt; and was set to play with their &lt;a href=\"SD%20Huesca%20B\"&gt;reserve team&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Tercera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. Having scored four goals in twelve matches, he played an important role as his side eventually made its own way through promotion to the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF\"&gt;Segunda Divisi\u00f3n RFEF&lt;/a&gt;. On June 21, the player announced the end of his experience in Huesca.\nOn July 11, 2021, it was announced that Arjona would join historic Spanish club &lt;a href=\"Recreativo%20de%20Huelva\"&gt;Recreativo de Huelva&lt;/a&gt;, which was in the midst of a rebuilding process after falling all the way down to the &lt;a href=\"Tercera%20Division%20RFEF\"&gt;Tercera Divisi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF\"&gt;\u00f3&lt;/a&gt;n RFEF, the newly-formed fifth tier of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;national football league system&lt;/a&gt;."
