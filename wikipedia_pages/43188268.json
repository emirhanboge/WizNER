The Go family is based in &lt;a href=\"Quezon%20City\"&gt;Quezon City&lt;/a&gt;, Philippines, and runs a processed and preserved food manufacturing business specializing in Chinese delicacies \u2013 started by his grandfather in the 1940s and still popular today among the Chinese community.\nHis family's Chinese food business manufactures the famous Fat &amp; Thin &lt;a href=\"champoy\"&gt;champoy&lt;/a&gt; candy, which had his father's cartoons and caricatures imprinted on the wrapper. And Go spent most of his time watching his father work, eventually acquiring the same love for the art.\nAs a young boy, Daniel Go showed considerable interest and skill in the visual arts during summer art classes and school competitions when he attended primary school at &lt;a href=\"Grace%20Christian%20High%20School\"&gt;Grace Christian High School&lt;/a&gt;, from 1973 to 1979, and at &lt;a href=\"Jubilee%20Christian%20Academy\"&gt;Jubilee Christian Academy&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 both in Quezon City \u2013 from 1979 to 1984 for his secondary education.\nHe decided to pursue his talent for drawings and illustrations by taking up Bachelor of Science in Architecture at the College of Architecture and Fine Arts of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Santo%20Tomas\"&gt;University of Santo Tomas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, where he graduated &lt;a href=\"cum%20laude\"&gt;cum laude&lt;/a&gt; from the graduating class of 1989.\nDaniel Go is married, and a father to four children \u2013 three sons and one daughter.\nAs a diversion from his work Go also has a passion for restoring cars, and considers running and &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; as his two main sports. He spends a lot of his leisure time with his family and travels a lot to learn the arts from different cultures.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating in 1989, Go briefly worked as an apprentice to Architect Jose Siao Ling where he was designated to work as a &lt;a href=\"draftsman\"&gt;draftsman&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after his apprenticeship with Architect Jose Siao Ling, he took up and passed his Architect Licensure Examination in 1991 where he then preceded to practice architecture professionally.\nIn 1996, Go established his own firm named Daniel C. Go &amp; Associates. Then in 2006, he was conferred and elevated to the College of Fellows in the Field and Category of Design of the &lt;a href=\"Architecture%20of%20the%20Philippines%23United%20Architects%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;United Architects of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; (UAP) During the same year, he established ADGO Architecture and Designs Inc., this time tackling bigger projects alongside a pool of younger architects. In 2008, Go was conferred as an APEC (&lt;a href=\"Asia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation\"&gt;Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation&lt;/a&gt;) Architect.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Christ%27s%20Commission%20Fellowship%23CCF%20Center\"&gt;Christ\u2019s Commission Fellowship Worship and Training Center&lt;/a&gt; (known as CCF Center) \u2013 completed in 2013 \u2013 was Go\u2019s first big project because during that time, Go hasn\u2019t designed anything of this magnitude, and designing and erecting this project took him seven years. The CCF Center is the international headquarters of the non-denominational megachurch called &lt;a href=\"Christ%27s%20Commission%20Fellowship\"&gt;Christ's Commission Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; (CCF). The 11-storey ministry building with more than 97,000 sqm floor area and an estimated seating capacity of 10,000, located in a 2.3 hectare lot in Pasig is one of the largest worship centers in the Philippines.\nAside from the CCF Center, another major project of Architect Go is the &lt;a href=\"BTTC%20Centre\"&gt;BTTC Centre&lt;/a&gt; in Greenhills, San Juan. Completed in 2013, the BTTC Centre is a LEED Gold certified building for Leadership in Energy and Environmental design from the &lt;a href=\"US%20Green%20Building%20Council\"&gt;US Green Building Council&lt;/a&gt; (USGBC). It is the first LEED Certified building in San Juan, and the first &lt;a href=\"Leadership%20in%20Energy%20and%20Environmental%20Design\"&gt;LEED&lt;/a&gt; Certified project of Architect Go.\nIn addition to these major projects, Architect Go has developed projects raging from residential spaces, condominiums, townhouse units, institutional buildings, warehouse compounds, commercial and office buildings, industrial complexes and hotels.\nArchitect Daniel Go\u2019s design philosophy is centered on his own brand of classicism, which he defines as both timeless and inspirational. He fuses &lt;a href=\"classical%20architecture\"&gt;classical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"modern%20architecture\"&gt;modern&lt;/a&gt; styles, creating sleek and modern living spaces more for practicality."
