    "title": "Havock-class destroyer",
    "text": "The \"Havock\" class was a &lt;a href=\"ship%20class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;torpedo boat destroyer&lt;/a&gt; (TBD) of the British &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;. The two ships, and , built in London in 1893 by &lt;a href=\"Yarrow%20%26amp%3B%20Company\"&gt;Yarrow &amp; Company&lt;/a&gt;, were the first TBDs to be completed for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;, although the equivalent pair from &lt;a href=\"John%20I.%20Thornycroft%20%26amp%3B%20Company\"&gt;J.I. Thornycroft&lt;/a&gt;, and , were ordered five days earlier.\nBackground.\nThe invention of the self-propelled &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Whitehead\"&gt;Robert Whitehead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Navy\"&gt;Austrian Navy&lt;/a&gt; Captain &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Luppis\"&gt;Giovanni Luppis&lt;/a&gt; in 1866, combined with the introduction of small fast &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s posed a threat to &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s: large numbers of torpedo boats could overwhelm a battleship's defences and sink it, or distract the battleship and make it vulnerable to opposing capital ships. Torpedo boats proved devastatingly effective in the &lt;a href=\"1891%20Chilean%20Civil%20War\"&gt;1891 Chilean Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe defence against torpedo boats was clear: small warships accompanying the fleet that could screen and protect it from attack by torpedo boats. Several European navies developed vessels variously known as torpedo boat \"catchers\", \"hunters\", and \"destroyers\"; while the Royal Navy itself operated &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20gunboat\"&gt;torpedo gunboat&lt;/a&gt;s. However, the early designs lacked the range and speed to keep up with the fleet they were supposed to protect. In 1892, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Sea%20Lord\"&gt;Third Sea Lord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rear%20Admiral\"&gt;Rear Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher\"&gt;Jackie Fisher&lt;/a&gt; ordered the development of a new type of ships equipped with the then novel &lt;a href=\"water-tube%20boiler\"&gt;water-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"British%20ordnance%20terms%23QF\"&gt;quick-firing&lt;/a&gt; small calibre guns.\nOrders.\nSix ships to the specifications circulated by the Admiralty were ordered initially, comprising three different designs each produced by a different shipbuilder:\nDesign.\n\"Havock\" was built with conventional locomotive boilers (giving her two closely spaced funnels) while \"Hornet\" was provided with 8 &lt;a href=\"water%20tube%20boiler\"&gt;water tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s (giving her 4 widely spaced funnels). In other respects they were largely identical.\nThese boats all featured a turtleback (i.e. rounded) &lt;a href=\"forecastle\"&gt;forecastle&lt;/a&gt; that was characteristic of early British TBDs. All six of them were removed from service and disposed of by the end of 1912, and thus were not affected by the Admiralty decision in 1913 to group all the surviving 27-knot and 30-knot destroyers (which had followed on these six 26-knot vessels) into four heterogeneous classes, labelled \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\" classes.\nConstruction and trials.\n\"Havock\" was launched first, on 12 August 1893. Her sea trials on 28 October 1893 were successful, her top speed indicating that she was capable of keeping up with battleships. However, her bow torpedo tube proved to be useless as the ship would usually outrun her own torpedo. It also tended to cause the bows to dig into the sea, resulting in a very wet turtleback. As such it (and later, the turtleback) was absent in later destroyers.\n\"Havock\" \"behaved well\" on trials. It was noted that \"Hornet\" \"steers readily and well\" but her coal consumption trial revealed that she used considerably more fuel than her sister.\nShips.\nFour other boats based on the \"Havock\" class, the \"Corrientes\" Class torpedo boat destroyers, were built for the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Navy\"&gt;Argentine Navy&lt;/a&gt;:\nRoyal Naval Service.\nBoth ships served in home waters, although \"Hornet\" was briefly in the Mediterranean in 1909. \"Havock\" had her locomotive boilers replaced with water-tube boilers in 1899\u20131900, altering her appearance to a more standard 3-funnel arrangement.\nFate.\n\"Havock\" and \"Hornet\" did not survive to see &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, being broken up in 1912 and 1909 respectively. With the exception of \"ARA Santa Fe\" (sunk 1897), three Argentine Corrientes Class boats served until 1930."
