    "title": "1988 Brazilian Grand Prix",
    "text": "The 1988 Brazilian Grand Prix was a &lt;a href=\"Formula%20One\"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; motor race held on April 3, 1988, at the renamed &lt;a href=\"Aut%C3%B3dromo%20Internacional%20Nelson%20Piquet\"&gt;Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional Nelson Piquet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. Following his 3rd World Drivers' Championship in the Jacarepagu\u00e1 Circuit was named after local hero &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20Piquet\"&gt;Nelson Piquet&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first race of the Formula One season.\nBackground.\nWinter testing had indicated &lt;a href=\"Scuderia%20Ferrari\"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; would be maintaining the edge that they had gained by winning the final two races of the season despite only having an updated version of their 1987 car, with &lt;a href=\"McLaren\"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Honda%20in%20Formula%20One\"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Williams%20Grand%20Prix%20Engineering\"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt;, now with naturally aspirated &lt;a href=\"Judd%20%28engine%29\"&gt;Judd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"V8%20engine\"&gt;V8 engine&lt;/a&gt;s, also producing cars that looked like potential race winners.\nFerrari had dominated the pre-season tests in Rio with times that were not only faster than everyone else, but faster than had been recorded at the &lt;a href=\"1987%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;1987 Brazilian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;, prompting rumors that the team had either shut off the FIA's mandatory pop-off valve which in 1988 limited turbo boost pressure to just 2.5 Bar, or more likely were running the 1987 valve which had a 4.0 Bar limit (most of the team engineers agreed that in 1988 the turbo engines had lost approximately due to the reduction in boost). The rumors were renewed during qualifying in Brazil when neither &lt;a href=\"Michele%20Alboreto\"&gt;Michele Alboreto&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"Gerhard%20Berger\"&gt;Gerhard Berger&lt;/a&gt; could get near their test times from a month earlier and both drivers complained of engines that were down on power, too thirsty and had poor throttle response out of the slower corners. With the 1988 pop-off valve connected, both &lt;a href=\"Ferrari%20F1/87%23F1/87/88C\"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;s were also significantly slower on the circuits long back straight than either the McLaren or Lotus Hondas which were all timed at over .\nDuring the qualifying session, there was controversy when &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20Piquet\"&gt;Nelson Piquet&lt;/a&gt; made comments in the local media publicly insulting &lt;a href=\"Ayrton%20Senna\"&gt;Ayrton Senna&lt;/a&gt;, though he later claimed he did not know he was talking to a journalist and was forced to withdraw his allegation under threat of a lawsuit (over time, these insults by Piquet \u2013 with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Alain%20Prost\"&gt;Prost&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 also extended to claims that Senna was homosexual, particularly given his failed marriage in 1982; as it transpired in a 1990 interview of Senna by &lt;a href=\"Playboy%20%28Brazil%29\"&gt;Brazilian edition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Playboy\"&gt;Playboy&lt;/a&gt; the gay claim may have been motivated by the fact that Senna had apparently had a relationship with Piquet's wife when she was single). The World Champion had also been insulting about &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Mansell\"&gt;Nigel Mansell&lt;/a&gt;'s wife Roseanne (calling her an \"unattractive boxhead\"), and both drivers' families.\n&lt;a href=\"BMS%20Scuderia%20Italia\"&gt;BMS Dallara&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Caffi\"&gt;Alex Caffi&lt;/a&gt; had to use a modified &lt;a href=\"Formula%203000\"&gt;Formula 3000&lt;/a&gt; chassis because the Formula One chassis was not ready. This was also the last time Ford-Cosworth DFV engine was used in a Formula One Grand Prix.\nDrivers making their debut in Rio were: Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Maur%C3%ADcio%20Gugelmin\"&gt;Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"March%20Engineering\"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;-Judd), Spanish driver &lt;a href=\"Luis%20P%C3%A9rez-Sala\"&gt;Luis P\u00e9rez-Sala&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Minardi\"&gt;Minardi&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Ford%20Motor%20Company\"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;), Argentinian Sportscar driver &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Larrauri\"&gt;Oscar Larrauri&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"EuroBrun\"&gt;EuroBrun&lt;/a&gt;-Ford) making his F1 debut at the age of 33, Briton &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Bailey\"&gt;Julian Bailey&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tyrrell%20Racing\"&gt;Tyrrell&lt;/a&gt;-Ford) who had sold just about everything he owned in order to pay for his drive with &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Tyrrell\"&gt;Ken Tyrrell&lt;/a&gt;'s team, and young &lt;a href=\"German%20Formula%20Three%20Championship\"&gt;German Formula 3 Champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bernd%20Schneider%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Bernd Schneider&lt;/a&gt; signed with &lt;a href=\"Zakspeed\"&gt;Zakspeed&lt;/a&gt;. Of the new drivers, only Bailey and Schneider failed to qualify.\n&lt;a href=\"EuroBrun\"&gt;EuroBrun&lt;/a&gt; (with Larrauri and &lt;a href=\"1987%20International%20Formula%203000%20season\"&gt;1987 International Formula 3000&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href=\"Stefano%20Modena\"&gt;Stefano Modena&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Rial%20Racing\"&gt;Rial Racing&lt;/a&gt;, with veteran &lt;a href=\"Andrea%20de%20Cesaris\"&gt;Andrea de Cesaris&lt;/a&gt; as its sole driver, were making their F1 debuts as constructors. The EuroRacing side of the EuroBrun team had formerly run the &lt;a href=\"Alfa%20Romeo%20in%20Formula%20One\"&gt;Alfa Romeo&lt;/a&gt; team in 1982\u201385, while Rial, run by German &lt;a href=\"G%C3%BCnter%20Schmid\"&gt;G\u00fcnter Schmid&lt;/a&gt;, was virtually a born-again &lt;a href=\"ATS%20%28wheels%29\"&gt;ATS&lt;/a&gt; which had competed in F1 in 1977\u201384. Both teams would use the 3.5L &lt;a href=\"Cosworth%20DFZ\"&gt;Ford DFZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"V8%20engine\"&gt;V8 engine&lt;/a&gt;.\nQualifying.\nJust five months after his crash at the &lt;a href=\"1987%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;1987 Japanese Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;, Mansell produced a sensational performance to qualify his &lt;a href=\"Naturally%20aspirated%20engine\"&gt;naturally aspirated&lt;/a&gt; Williams second, 1.5 seconds faster than the next 'atmo' car, the &lt;a href=\"Benetton%20B188\"&gt;Benetton&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Cosworth%20DFR\"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thierry%20Boutsen\"&gt;Thierry Boutsen&lt;/a&gt; in 7th. On the pole was Senna in his first drive for McLaren with a time almost two seconds slower than Mansell's &lt;a href=\"1987%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt; pole time. The second row was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Gerhard%20Berger\"&gt;Gerhard Berger&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ferrari%20F1/87\"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alain%20Prost\"&gt;Alain Prost&lt;/a&gt;'s McLaren. After only a small amount of testing at &lt;a href=\"Autodromo%20Enzo%20e%20Dino%20Ferrari\"&gt;Imola&lt;/a&gt; before joining in the Rio tests due to the late finish of the car, neither Senna or Prost were happy with the balance of their &lt;a href=\"McLaren%20MP4/4\"&gt;McLaren MP4/4&lt;/a&gt;s in qualifying.\nBy qualifying on the front row, Mansell became the first driver of a naturally aspirated (atmo) car to start on the front row of a Grand Prix since his former Williams teammate &lt;a href=\"Keke%20Rosberg\"&gt;Keke Rosberg&lt;/a&gt; had put his &lt;a href=\"Williams%20FW08\"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Cosworth%20DFV\"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; on pole position for the &lt;a href=\"1983%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;1983 Brazilian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at the same circuit.\nThe four non-qualifiers were the &lt;a href=\"Tyrrell%20017\"&gt;Tyrrell&lt;/a&gt;-Ford of Julian Bailey, the turbo Zakspeeds of &lt;a href=\"Piercarlo%20Ghinzani\"&gt;Piercarlo Ghinzani&lt;/a&gt; and Schneider, and the turbo &lt;a href=\"Osella\"&gt;Osella&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nicola%20Larini\"&gt;Nicola Larini&lt;/a&gt;. Alex Caffi failed to pre-qualify his converted F3000 Dallara.\nRace summary.\nOn the parade lap, Senna's gear selector mechanism broke and he had to complete the lap jammed in first gear. The first start was aborted and Senna started in the spare car from the pits. At the second start, Alain Prost with no one in front of him due to Senna's absence, won the start and put in one of his famous first laps that saw him lead by almost 2 seconds, with Mansell in 2nd place, though he was soon passed by Berger's &lt;a href=\"Ferrari%20F1/87\"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;. After running in the hot air behind the turbocharged Ferrari, on lap 19 Mansell's temperature gauge showed that the &lt;a href=\"Williams%20FW12\"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt; was overheating (at the first aborted start Mansell had been forced to drive off around the track, thankfully without penalty, due to his Judd V8 already overheating on the grid). He entered the pits to investigate, handing third to Nelson Piquet in his &lt;a href=\"Lotus%20100T\"&gt;Lotus&lt;/a&gt;; during the process, Mansell stalled his engine.\nSenna was making a remarkable drive from the rear of the grid, climbing to 21st on lap 1 (after almost colliding with the &lt;a href=\"March%20881\"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt; of his former flatmate &lt;a href=\"Maur%C3%ADcio%20Gugelmin\"&gt;Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin&lt;/a&gt; who suffered gearbox failure less than 50 metres after the start of his debut race and pulled to the inside of the track as Senna was leaving the pits), 15th on lap 4, 8th on lap 10, into the points on lap 13 and by lap 20 was in second place after passing Piquet on the back straight following a pit stop to Berger.\nIn previous years with high horsepower, the Rio circuit had proved savage on tyres and drivers were forced to stop two or three times a race for new rubber. With the reduction of turbo boost in 1988, tyre wear was reduced and McLaren figured on only one stop for their drivers. Prost pitted on lap 26 without losing the lead, and Senna pitted a lap later. During his stop Senna stalled his Honda engine and dropped to sixth place. Shortly afterwards he was shown the &lt;a href=\"Racing%20flag%23Black%20flag\"&gt;black flag&lt;/a&gt; and disqualified for changing cars after the &lt;a href=\"Racing%20flag%23Green%20flag\"&gt;green flag&lt;/a&gt; had been shown following the parade lap, a move that was not allowed. Over the last 10 laps of the race Berger closed to within 10 seconds of leader Prost, but the Frenchman was merely pacing himself to make sure he finished on the now lower fuel limit and Berger was unable to catch him.\nPiquet, the reigning &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions\"&gt;World Champion&lt;/a&gt;, came home third in his first drive for &lt;a href=\"Team%20Lotus\"&gt;Lotus&lt;/a&gt; ahead of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Warwick\"&gt;Derek Warwick&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20Grand%20Prix%20International\"&gt;Arrows&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"BMW%20M12\"&gt;Megatron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Michele%20Alboreto\"&gt;Michele Alboreto&lt;/a&gt; in the second Ferrari and &lt;a href=\"Satoru%20Nakajima\"&gt;Satoru Nakajima&lt;/a&gt; in the second Lotus rounded out the points with 5th and 6th places. The first &lt;a href=\"Naturally%20aspirated%20engine\"&gt;atmospheric&lt;/a&gt; car to finish was the &lt;a href=\"Benetton%20B188\"&gt;Benetton&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Cosworth%20DFR\"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thierry%20Boutsen\"&gt;Thierry Boutsen&lt;/a&gt;. Nakajima and Boutsen both finished a lap down on Prost in 7th place. The first race of FISA's new equivalency formula in a bid to make the 'atmos' competitive had seen turbos still take all the points on offer."
