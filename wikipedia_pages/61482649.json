The &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20at%20the%202015%20Pan%20American%20Games%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%204%20%C3%97%20100%20metres%20relay\"&gt;defending&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pan%20American%20Games\"&gt;Pan American Games&lt;/a&gt; champion is &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nUSA tried to use the advantage of &lt;a href=\"USC%20Trojans\"&gt;USC&lt;/a&gt; teammates &lt;a href=\"Chanel%20Brissett\"&gt;Chanel Brissett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twanisha%20Terry\"&gt;Twanisha Terry&lt;/a&gt; on their first two legs. It didn't work because the two teammates didn't hand off at USC, USA found themselves in dead last at the first exchange. The lost their stagger advantage to Brazil on their inside, while on the far outside, Trinidad and Tobago and Canada with returning 2015 bronze medalists &lt;a href=\"Khamica%20Bingham\"&gt;Khamica Bingham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Emmanuel\"&gt;Crystal Emmanuel&lt;/a&gt; were out ahead. Ecuador took too long to pass at the first exchange and were disqualified. Terry did gain some ground back from Brazil's &lt;a href=\"Vit%C3%B3ria%20Cristina%20Rosa\"&gt;Vit\u00f3ria Cristina Rosa&lt;/a&gt; on her leg. Brazil was first to make the second pass, with Trinidad arriving ahead of Canada but making a slow handoff from veteran &lt;a href=\"Michelle-Lee%20Ahye\"&gt;Michelle-Lee Ahye&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mauricia%20Prieto\"&gt;Mauricia Prieto&lt;/a&gt;. Peru and Bahamas disappeared at the second handoff. &lt;a href=\"Shania%20Collins\"&gt;Shania Collins&lt;/a&gt; burned the turn for USA, catching up to within a step of &lt;a href=\"Lorraine%20Martins\"&gt;Lorraine Martins&lt;/a&gt; for Brazil by the third handoff, ahead of Trinidad and Canada. It was a looking like battle as &lt;a href=\"Lynna%20Irby\"&gt;Lynna Irby&lt;/a&gt; would try to pull in Brazilian veteran &lt;a href=\"Ros%C3%A2ngela%20Santos\"&gt;Ros\u00e2ngela Santos&lt;/a&gt; but Irby's &lt;a href=\"400%20metres\"&gt;400&lt;/a&gt; speed was no match for Santos. Instead Canada's &lt;a href=\"Leya%20Buchanan\"&gt;Leya Buchanan&lt;/a&gt; ran past Trinidad's veteran &lt;a href=\"Kelly-Ann%20Baptiste\"&gt;Kelly-Ann Baptiste&lt;/a&gt; and nipped Irby at the line for silver.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Pan American Games records were as follows:\nResults.\nAll times shown are in seconds.\nFinal.\nThe results were as follows"
