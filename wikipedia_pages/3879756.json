It was previously known as the &lt;a href=\"Jakarta%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;Jakarta Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (JSX) before its name changed in 2007 after merging with the &lt;a href=\"Surabaya%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;Surabaya Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (SSX). During recent years, Indonesia Stock Exchange sees fastest membership growth in Asia. As of September 2021, the Indonesia Stock Exchange had 750 listed companies, and total stock investors were about 6.4 million, compared to 2.5 million at the end of 2019. . Indonesia Market Capitalization accounted for 45.2% of its Nominal GDP in Dec 2020.\nThe current location of the Indonesian Stock Exchange is located in the IDX building in the &lt;a href=\"Sudirman%20Central%20Business%20District\"&gt;Sudirman Central Business District&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Jakarta\"&gt;South Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, close to &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Place%20Jakarta\"&gt;Pacific Place Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nHistorically, the capital market has existed long before Indonesia's independence. The capital market or stock exchange has existed since the Dutch colonial era and precisely in 1912 in Batavia. The capital market at that time was established by the Dutch East Indies government for the benefit of the colonial government or the VOC.\nAlthough the capital market has existed since 1912, the development and growth of the capital market did not go as expected, even during several periods of capital market activity experiencing a vacuum. This was caused by several factors such as the world war which required the stock exchange to be closed, including in 1914-1918 the stock exchange was closed due to the occurrence of World War I. World II, the Stock Exchanges in Semarang and Surabaya had to be closed again in early 1939, and continued with the closing of the Stock Exchanges in Jakarta in 1942\u20131952. The transfer of power from the colonial government to the government of the Republic of Indonesia, and various conditions that caused the operation of the stock exchange to not run properly.\nThe Government of the Republic of Indonesia reactivated the capital market in 1977, the Stock Exchange was inaugurated by President Soeharto on August 10, 1977. JSE is run under BAPEPAM (Capital Market Executing Agency). The reactivation of the capital market was also marked by \"going public with\" PT Semen Cibinong as the first issuer.\nHowever, in 1977-1987 trading on the Stock Exchange was very sluggish. The number of issuers until 1987 only reached 24 issuers. At that time, people preferred banking instruments to capital market instruments. Finally, in 1987 the Stock Exchange was deregulated by presenting the December 1987 Package (PAKDES 87) which made it easier for companies to conduct Public Offerings and foreign investors to invest in Indonesia. Stock Exchange trading activities also increased in 1988-1990 after the deregulation package in the banking and capital markets was launched. JSE's door is open to foreigners.\nThe Indonesian Parallel Exchange (BPI) began operating and is managed by the Money and Securities Trading Union (PPUE) in 1988 with its organization consisting of brokers and dealers. In addition, in the same year, the Government issued the December 88 Package (PAKDES 88) which made it easier for companies to \"go public\" and several other policies that were positive for capital market growth. The Surabaya Stock Exchange (BES) began operating in 1989 and is managed by a privately owned Limited Liability Company, namely the Surabaya Stock Exchange.\nOn July 12, 1992, which has been designated as the Anniversary of the JSE, the JSE officially became a private company (privatization). BAPEPAM changed to Capital Market Supervisory Agency (formerly; Capital Market Implementing Agency). One year later on December 21, 1993, PT Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia (PEFINDO) was established. On May 22, 1995, the Jakarta Stock Exchange launched a trading Automated System which was implemented using the JATS ( \"Jakarta Automated Trading Systems)\" computer system.). In the same year on November 10, the Government of Indonesia issued Law Number 8 of 1995 concerning the Capital Market. This law came into effect in January 1996. The Indonesia Parallel Exchange was then merged with the Surabaya Stock Exchange. Then one year later, August 6, 1996, the Indonesian Clearing and Guarantee Corporation (KPEI) was established. This was followed by the establishment of the Indonesian Central Securities Depository (KSEI) the following year, 23 December 1997. The \"scripless trading system\" in 2000 was applied to the Indonesian capital market, and in 2002 the JSX began to apply the \"remote trading system.\" ).

In 2004, the Stock Exchange released S\"tock Options\" .\nOn November 30, 2007, the Surabaya Stock Exchange (BES) and the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) were finally merged and changed their names to the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). After the birth of the IDX, a trading suspension was enforced in 2008 and the Indonesian Stock Price Appraiser (PHEI) was formed in 2009. In addition, in 2009, the Indonesia Stock Exchange changed the old trading system (JATS) and launched a new trading system used by the Indonesian Stock Exchange. IDX until now, namely JATS-NextG.

IDX introduced the campaign for the first time on November 12, 2015, and this campaign is still being implemented today, and in the same year the LQ-45 \"Index Futures\" was inaugurated.
