    "text": "Openbravo is a Spanish &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20computing\"&gt;cloud&lt;/a&gt;-based software provider specializing in &lt;a href=\"retail\"&gt;retail&lt;/a&gt; and restaurants; formerly known as a horizontal open source ERP software vendor for different industries. The head office of Openbravo is located in &lt;a href=\"Pamplona\"&gt;Pamplona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. Openbravo also has offices in &lt;a href=\"Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and Lille. The company's main product is Openbravo Commerce Cloud, a cloud-based omnichannel platform.\nHistory.\nOpenbravo's roots are in the development of business administration software, first developed by two employees of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Navarra\"&gt;University of Navarra&lt;/a&gt;, Nicolas Serrano and Ismael Ciordia. They were both involved in the mid 1990s in developing the management of the university. They used emerging &lt;a href=\"internet\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; technologies while doing their work, and subsequently introduced a new approach for web applications. Their concept was realized in a new company called Tecnicia, founded in August 2001 by Serrano, Ciordia, and Aguinaga. In 2005, two management consultants, Manel Sarasa and Josep Mitj\u00e1, were asked by a &lt;a href=\"venture%20capital\"&gt;venture capital&lt;/a&gt; company to evaluate Tecnicia and prepare a business plan for its evolution. In 2006, the two consultants joined Tecnicia as the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20executive%20officer\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chief%20operating%20officer\"&gt;COO&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Around the same time the Spanish investment company Sodena invested US$6.4 million in the further development of the company.\nIn 2006 the company was renamed Openbravo and the first product launched was Openbravo ERP. The code was open-sourced in April that same year. In 2007, the company announced the acquisition of LibrePOS, a Java-based Point-of-Sale (POS) application for the retail and hospitality businesses. LibrePOS was rebranded as Openbravo POS (or Openbravo Java POS). In May 2008 Openbravo attracted three more investors, Amadeus (UK), GIMV (Belgium) and Adara (Spain) for a second investment round totalling US$12.5 million. This investment launched Openbravo as one of the leading open source companies with substantial resources to further develop its products and services.\nIn July 2012 Openbravo launched Openbravo for Retail, a vertical solution for the Retail industry including the Openbravo Web POS, a new POS solution that replaced the previous Openbravo Java POS. Openbravo Web POS is a web, mobile and responsive POS solution.\nIn March 2014, Openbravo ERP was renamed to Openbravo ERP Platform and Openbravo for Retail renamed to Openbravo Commerce Platform.\nIn May 2015, the Openbravo Commerce Platform and Openbravo ERP Platform were renamed to Openbravo Commerce Suite and Openbravo Business Suite. Openbravo announces its strategic focus in Retail. Openbravo also launches the Openbravo Subscription Management and Recurring Billing, a specialized solution for recurring transactions based revenue models.\nIn February 2016, Openbravo launches Openbravo Cloud, its official cloud offering, and starts the distribution of Openbravo Commerce Cloud, a cloud-based and mobile-enabled omnichannel platform for midsize to large retail and restaurant chains.\nIn 2018, Openbravo announces a certified SAP connector to facilitate integration of the Openbravo Commerce Cloud in all those clients running SAP as their central corporate system.\nBusiness and markets.\nOpenbravo targets today mid-sized to large retail and restaurant chains seeking for a new cloud-based platform to support their omnichannel operations. Typically with a physical network of 15/20 locations and more and running omnichannel operations.\nCurrent products.\nOpenbravo currently distributes Openbravo Commerce Cloud, a mobile and cloud omnichannel platform targeting retail and restaurant chains to support its omnichannel operations. The functionality offered by the platform covers both front and backoffice processes for the integration of all sales channels. Features such as a web and mobile point of sale, an integrated OMS engine, CRM &amp; &lt;a href=\"Clienteling\"&gt;Clienteling&lt;/a&gt; functionalities or mobile warehouse and inventory management among others. The company also offers connectors with external solutions such as ERP, eCommerce payments and others.\nThe Openbravo platform is distributed under an annual subscription model, based mainly on the number of concurrent backoffice users and number of points of sale (POS or POS) subscribed. Additional costs may exist for subscription to additional commercial functionality as connectors with external systems.\nPrevious products (discontinued).\nSince its appearance in the market in 2006, Openbravo has launched different products that help to describe the evolution of the company. The following information is shown for historical purposes only, since all these products are no longer offered.\nOpenbravo ERP.\nOpenbravo ERP was the first product launched by Openbravo.

The model for the program was originally based on the &lt;a href=\"Compiere\"&gt;Compiere&lt;/a&gt; ERP program that is also open source, released under the &lt;a href=\"GNU%20General%20Public%20License\"&gt;GNU General Public License&lt;/a&gt; version 2.
