Their &lt;a href=\"feast%20day\"&gt;feast day&lt;/a&gt; is celebrated on September 16.\nBiography.\nAbundius was a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; who had earlier &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt;ed &lt;a href=\"John%20and%20Marcianus\"&gt;John, the son of Marcianus&lt;/a&gt;. Upon hearing of this, the emperor ordered these three, with Abundantius, a deacon, to be &lt;a href=\"decapitation\"&gt;beheaded&lt;/a&gt;. The executions were carried out at the 26th &lt;a href=\"milestone\"&gt;milestone&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Via%20Flaminia\"&gt;Via Flaminia&lt;/a&gt;.\nVeneration.\nTheir bodies were later transferred to the church of &lt;a href=\"Cosmas%20and%20Damian\"&gt;Cosmas and Damian&lt;/a&gt; in Rome. The bodies of &lt;a href=\"John%20and%20Marcianus\"&gt;Marcianus and John&lt;/a&gt; were found around 1001 and transferred to &lt;a href=\"Civita%20Castellana\"&gt;Civita Castellana&lt;/a&gt;. There, they were elected to be the city's principal &lt;a href=\"patron%20saints\"&gt;patron saints&lt;/a&gt;. In 1583, the relics of Abundius and Abundantius were transferred to the SS. Nome di Gesu, where they were placed under the church's &lt;a href=\"altar\"&gt;high altar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aloysius%20Gonzaga\"&gt;Aloysius Gonzaga&lt;/a&gt; heard &lt;a href=\"mass%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt; there before becoming a &lt;a href=\"Jesuit\"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt;."
