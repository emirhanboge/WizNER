    "title": "Administrative geography of the United Kingdom",
    "text": "The administrative geography of the United Kingdom is complex, multi-layered and non-uniform. The &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"sovereign%20state\"&gt;sovereign state&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest of &lt;a href=\"continental%20Europe\"&gt;continental Europe&lt;/a&gt;, consists of &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. For &lt;a href=\"local%20government%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;local government in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each have their own system of administrative and geographic demarcation. Consequently, there is \"no common stratum of administrative unit encompassing the United Kingdom\".\nBecause there is no written document that comprehensively encompasses the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British constitution&lt;/a&gt;, and owing to a convoluted &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20the%20formation%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;history of the formation of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, a variety of terms are used to refer to its constituent parts, which are sometimes called the four &lt;a href=\"countries%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;countries of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The four are sometimes collectively referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Home%20Nations\"&gt;Home Nations&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in sporting contexts. Although the four countries are important for legal and governmental purposes, they are not comparable to administrative subdivisions of most other countries.\nThe United Kingdom also contains 17 &lt;a href=\"%23Dependent%20territories\"&gt;dependent territories&lt;/a&gt; which aren't officially a part of the UK but are represented by it in places like the UN.\nHistorically, the subnational divisions of the UK have been the &lt;a href=\"Counties%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ecclesiastical%20parish\"&gt;ecclesiastical parish&lt;/a&gt;, whilst following the emergence of a unified &lt;a href=\"parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;parliament of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wards%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20constituencies\"&gt;constituency&lt;/a&gt; have been pan-UK political subdivisions. More contemporary divisions include &lt;a href=\"Lieutenancy%20area\"&gt;Lieutenancy area&lt;/a&gt;s and the statistical territories defined with the modern &lt;a href=\"ITL%20%28UK%29\"&gt;ITL&lt;/a&gt; (formerly &lt;a href=\"Nomenclature%20of%20Territorial%20Units%20for%20Statistics\"&gt;NUTS&lt;/a&gt;) and systems.\nHistory.\nThis structure was formed by the &lt;a href=\"political%20union\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt; agreed between the former &lt;a href=\"Sovereignty\"&gt;sovereign states&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20England\"&gt;Kingdom of England&lt;/a&gt; (including the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Principality of Wales&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Kingdom of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Union\"&gt;Treaty of Union&lt;/a&gt; and enacted by the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Union%201707\"&gt;Acts of Union 1707&lt;/a&gt; to form the single &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Kingdom of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; (1707\u20131800); followed by the &lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20Union%201800\"&gt;Act of Union 1800&lt;/a&gt;, which combined Great Britain with the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Kingdom of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"independence\"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt; in 1922, following the &lt;a href=\"partition%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;partition of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, resulted in the present-day &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nWales was incorporated into the English legal system through the &lt;a href=\"Laws%20in%20Wales%20Acts%201535-1542\"&gt;Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542&lt;/a&gt;, the earlier &lt;a href=\"Statute%20of%20Rhuddlan\"&gt;Statute of Rhuddlan&lt;/a&gt; having restricted but not abolished Welsh Law following the &lt;a href=\"Edwardian%20conquest\"&gt;Edwardian conquest&lt;/a&gt; in 1282. As a result, &lt;a href=\"England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;England and Wales&lt;/a&gt; are treated as a single entity for some purposes, principally that they share a legal system (see &lt;a href=\"English%20law\"&gt;English law&lt;/a&gt;), while Scotland and Northern Ireland each have a separate legal system (see &lt;a href=\"Scots%20Law\"&gt;Scots Law&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20law\"&gt;Northern Ireland law&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; was the first part of the British Isles to have a &lt;a href=\"devolved\"&gt;devolved&lt;/a&gt; government, under the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Ireland%20Act%201920\"&gt;Government of Ireland Act 1920&lt;/a&gt;, and that continued until the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Parliament of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; was suspended in 1972. After a period of &lt;a href=\"Direct%20rule%20over%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;direct rule&lt;/a&gt; by the Westminster government and some abortive attempts at reinstating devolved government during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Troubles\"&gt;Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, the present-day &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20Assembly\"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt; was established in 1998, and is currently in operation following a number of periods of suspension. The complex history of Northern Ireland has led to differing views as to its status. The term \"Province\" is often used by &lt;a href=\"Unionism%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;unionist&lt;/a&gt; and British commentators to refer to Northern Ireland, but not by &lt;a href=\"Irish%20nationalism\"&gt;nationalists&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview of administration.\nThe markers above link to relevant articles where available.\nLocal government.\nEngland.\nEngland has no &lt;a href=\"devolved%20English%20parliament\"&gt;devolved national legislature or government&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe highest level subdivisions of England are the nine &lt;a href=\"regions%20of%20England\"&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt;. The London region, known as &lt;a href=\"Greater%20London\"&gt;Greater London&lt;/a&gt;, is further divided into the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt; and 32 &lt;a href=\"London%20borough\"&gt;London borough&lt;/a&gt;s. This is administered by the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20London%20Authority\"&gt;Greater London Authority&lt;/a&gt;, including the directly elected &lt;a href=\"London%20Assembly\"&gt;London Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. The other regions are made up of &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20and%20non-metropolitan%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unitary%20authorities%20of%20England\"&gt;unitary authorities&lt;/a&gt;. The counties are further divided into &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20England\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt; (which can be called cities, boroughs, royal boroughs, metropolitan boroughs or districts). The &lt;a href=\"Unitary%20authorities%20of%20England\"&gt;unitary authorities&lt;/a&gt; effectively combine the functions of counties and districts.\nBelow the district level, &lt;a href=\"Civil%20parishes%20in%20England\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt;es exist, though not uniformly. Parish or town councils exist for villages and small towns; they only rarely exist for communities within urban areas.\nCommonly, though not administratively, England's geography is divided into &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;ceremonial counties&lt;/a&gt;, which in most areas closely mirror the &lt;a href=\"Historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;traditional counties&lt;/a&gt;. Each ceremonial county has a &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Lieutenant\"&gt;Lord Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, who is the monarch's representative.\nNorthern Ireland.\nNorthern Ireland has the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20Assembly\"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20Executive\"&gt;Northern Ireland Executive&lt;/a&gt; established under the &lt;a href=\"Good%20Friday%20Agreement\"&gt;Good Friday Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. During periods where the devolved institutions were suspended, executive government in Northern Ireland was administered directly by the &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and laws made in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Parliament\"&gt;United Kingdom Parliament&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 known as \"direct rule\" in contrast to &lt;a href=\"devolution\"&gt;devolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor local government, Northern Ireland is divided into 11 &lt;a href=\"districts%20of%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;districts&lt;/a&gt;, which are unitary authorities.\nNorthern Ireland is divided into six traditional &lt;a href=\"Counties%20of%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;counties&lt;/a&gt;. Though widely used, these no longer serve any administrative purpose.\nScotland.\nScotland has a devolved &lt;a href=\"legislature\"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Parliament\"&gt;Scottish Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, with a government, the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Executive\"&gt;Scottish Executive&lt;/a&gt;, since 1999. Since 2007 the Scottish Executive has been called the Scottish government.\nFor local government, Scotland has 32 &lt;a href=\"council%20areas%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;council areas&lt;/a&gt; (unitary authorities). Below this uniform level of subdivision, there are varying levels of &lt;a href=\"area%20committees\"&gt;area committees&lt;/a&gt; in the larger rural council areas, and many small &lt;a href=\"community%20councils\"&gt;community councils&lt;/a&gt; throughout the country, although these are not universal. Scottish community councils have few if any powers beyond being a forum for raising issues of concern.\nWales.\nWales has an elected, devolved legislature, the &lt;a href=\"Senedd\"&gt;Senedd&lt;/a&gt; (Welsh Parliament; ), from which the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Government\"&gt;Welsh Government&lt;/a&gt; is drawn.\nFor local government, Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities: 10 &lt;a href=\"county%20borough\"&gt;county borough&lt;/a&gt;s, 9 Counties, and 3 Cities. Below these are community councils, which have powers similar to those of English parish councils.\nWales is also divided into &lt;a href=\"Preserved%20counties%20of%20Wales\"&gt;preserved counties&lt;/a&gt;, which are used for ceremonial purposes. Although based on the &lt;a href=\"subdivisions%20of%20Wales\"&gt;counties&lt;/a&gt; used for local government between 1974 and 1996, they no longer have an administrative function.\nDemocratic representation.\nParliaments.\nIn terms of the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Parliament of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, each of the 650 electoral areas or divisions called &lt;a href=\"Constituency\"&gt;constituencies&lt;/a&gt; has since 1950 elected one &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (MP) to represent it at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;House of Commons of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Before 1950, some constituencies elected two or more MPs using the &lt;a href=\"plurality%20bloc%20vote\"&gt;plurality bloc vote&lt;/a&gt; system, and before the &lt;a href=\"Reform%20Act%201832\"&gt;Reform Act 1832&lt;/a&gt; nearly all constituencies in England returned two MPs.\nThe devolved &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Parliament\"&gt;Scottish Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, the Welsh &lt;a href=\"Senedd\"&gt;Senedd&lt;/a&gt; both use an &lt;a href=\"additional%20member%20system\"&gt;additional member system&lt;/a&gt; of elections, which combines single-member constituencies with multi-member electoral regions.\nElections to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20Assembly\"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt; are held under the &lt;a href=\"single%20transferable%20vote\"&gt;single transferable vote&lt;/a&gt; (STV) system, in 18 multi-member constituencies.\nLocal government.\nThe &lt;a href=\"wards%20and%20electoral%20divisions%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; are electoral districts at subnational level represented by one or more councillors at &lt;a href=\"local%20authority\"&gt;local authority&lt;/a&gt; level, or else used to divide the electorate into &lt;a href=\"electoral%20district\"&gt;electoral district&lt;/a&gt;s for voting. It is the primary unit of British electoral geography.\nInformal divisions.\nThere are also many informal, historical and special purpose regional designations. Some such as the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Highlands\"&gt;Highlands of Scotland&lt;/a&gt; have or have had, to some extent, formal boundaries. Others such as the &lt;a href=\"London%20commuter%20belt\"&gt;London commuter belt&lt;/a&gt; are more diffuse. Some such as &lt;a href=\"Snowdonia\"&gt;Snowdonia&lt;/a&gt; (\"Eryri\") have a formal boundary in some contexts; in this case as a &lt;a href=\"National%20Park\"&gt;National Park&lt;/a&gt;. Others such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Fens\"&gt;The Fens&lt;/a&gt; of eastern &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; are quite distinctly &lt;a href=\"Intensional%20definition\"&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"geography\"&gt;geography&lt;/a&gt; but do not form any official &lt;a href=\"polity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational subdivisions.\nThe UK's &lt;a href=\"Office%20for%20National%20Statistics\"&gt;Office for National Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization\"&gt;International Organization for Standardization&lt;/a&gt; and before 2021 [Eurostat]], have developed subdivision codes for the UK. See &lt;a href=\"ITL%20%28UK%29\"&gt;ITL (UK)&lt;/a&gt; and .\nDependent territories.\nThe United Kingdom has 17 dependent territories in total, three \"&lt;a href=\"Crown%20dependencies\"&gt;Crown dependencies&lt;/a&gt;\" in the British Isles and in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Channel\"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt; and fourteen \"&lt;a href=\"British%20overseas%20territories\"&gt;overseas territories&lt;/a&gt;\" scattered around the world.\nUnlike other former colonial powers, the British Government does not classify its overseas possessions (or the crown dependencies, which share historical ties with the British Crown) as subdivisions of the United Kingdom itself; rather, each is treated in law as a separate jurisdiction. Most have their own legislatures and a degree of autonomy usually exceeding that of the devolved UK nations, including fiscal independence. \nOut of the 14 overseas territories, 10 are autonomous, &lt;a href=\"Akrotiri%20and%20Dhekelia\"&gt;two used&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"British%20Indian%20Ocean%20Territory\"&gt;primarily&lt;/a&gt; as military bases, &lt;a href=\"South%20Georgia%20and%20the%20South%20Sandwich%20Islands\"&gt;one uninhabited&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"British%20Antarctic%20Territory\"&gt;one an Antarctic claim&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the UK retains varying degrees of responsibility in all of the territories, currently ranging from full political control to a largely ceremonial presence. The main reserved matters are the areas of diplomacy, international treaties, defence and security. The UK also retains in all territories a residual responsibility for 'good governance', a loosely defined constitutional concept recently exemplified by its imposition of direct rule following alleged serious corruption in the &lt;a href=\"Turks%20and%20Caicos%20Islands\"&gt;Turks and Caicos Islands&lt;/a&gt;. The UK parliament at Westminster, and the British Government through the Privy Council, both retain the power to legislate for the overseas territories \u2013 though by convention will usually only do so with each local government's consent.\nThe three &lt;a href=\"crown%20dependencies\"&gt;crown dependencies&lt;/a&gt; within the British Isles are self-governing possessions of &lt;a href=\"the%20Crown\"&gt;the British Crown&lt;/a&gt;. They are distinct from the British overseas territories of the United Kingdom."
