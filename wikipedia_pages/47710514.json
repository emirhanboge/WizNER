    "text": "Damasko is a manufacturer of mechanical wristwatches and &lt;a href=\"chronograph\"&gt;chronograph&lt;/a&gt;s based in &lt;a href=\"Barbing\"&gt;Barbing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDamasko was formed in 1994 using high-performance materials technology that the founder, Konrad Damasko, had developed for applications including the aerospace industry. Until their partnership ended in 2002, Damasko was a supplier of hardened watchcases to &lt;a href=\"Sinn%20%28watchmaker%29\"&gt;Sinn&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014 Damasko released its first models based on a movement designed themselves. Prior to this time its watches had relied upon movements sourced from companies such as &lt;a href=\"Valjoux\"&gt;Valjoux&lt;/a&gt;.\nTechnology.\nDamasko holds patents in the use of polycrystalline silicon for components, including the &lt;a href=\"Balance%20spring\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;. Damasko has also developed a nickel-free, nitrogen enriched martensitic alloy that is hardened up to 64 HRC/800 Vickers.\nAwards and certifications.\nThe Damasko DC56 has been certified as an official wristwatch for &lt;a href=\"Eurofighter\"&gt;Eurofighter&lt;/a&gt; test pilots.\nIn 2015 the Damasko DA38 was nominated one of the best men's watches under \u20ac2000 by &lt;a href=\"GQ\"&gt;GQ magazine&lt;/a&gt;."
