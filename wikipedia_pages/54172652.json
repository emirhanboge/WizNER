    "text": "Khosrow-Yazdegerd was a 5th-century statesman in &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20Empire\"&gt;Sasanian Iran&lt;/a&gt;, who was active during the reign of &lt;a href=\"shah\"&gt;shah&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yazdegerd%20I\"&gt;Yazdegerd I&lt;/a&gt; (r. 399-421). He first appears in 410, when he was sent with Mihr-Shapur as the shah's representative to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20East\"&gt;Nestorian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seleucia-Ctesiphon\"&gt;Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon&lt;/a&gt;. Khosrow-Yazdegerd is the second person known to occupy the office of \"&lt;a href=\"wuzurg%20framadar\"&gt;wuzurg framadar&lt;/a&gt;\" (grand vizier) after &lt;a href=\"Abarsam\"&gt;Abarsam&lt;/a&gt;, who was active under &lt;a href=\"Ardashir%20I\"&gt;Ardashir I&lt;/a&gt; (r. 224-242). He was most likely succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Mihr%20Narseh\"&gt;Mihr Narseh&lt;/a&gt;."
