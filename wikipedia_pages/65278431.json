    "text": "The 2020 &lt;a href=\"WNBA%20Playoffs\"&gt;WNBA Playoffs&lt;/a&gt; was the postseason tournament of the &lt;a href=\"WNBA\"&gt;WNBA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"2020%20WNBA%20season\"&gt;2020 season&lt;/a&gt; being played in Bradenton, Florida at the &lt;a href=\"IMG%20Academy\"&gt;IMG Academy&lt;/a&gt;, known for the season as the \"wubble.\" The &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Storm\"&gt;Seattle Storm&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas%20Aces\"&gt;Las Vegas Aces&lt;/a&gt; three games to zero in the finals to claim the franchise's fourth WNBA title. \nFormat.\nFollowing the WNBA regular season, the top eight teams in the overall league standings, without regard to conference alignment, qualified for the playoffs and were seeded from one to eight. Seedings were based strictly on regular-season record. The team with the best record received the #1 seed, the team with the next best record received the #2 seed, and so on. The top two seeds earned double byes (i.e., advanced directly to the semifinals), while the next two seeds received first-round byes.\nThese seedings were used to create a bracket that determines the matchups throughout the playoffs. The first round of the playoffs consisted of two matchups based on the seedings (5-8 and 6-7). The two winners advanced to the second round with a matchup between the number three seed and the lower of the advancing seeds and another matchup between the number four seed and the other first round winner. The winners of the first two rounds advanced to the semifinals, where the lower-ranked seed of the winners faces the number one seed, with the other remaining team facing the number two seed.\nChanges due to COVID-19.\nThe playoffs were less affected than the &lt;a href=\"2020%20WNBA%20season\"&gt;regular season&lt;/a&gt; for the WNBA. Format and seeding remained the same as it has in recent years. However, the teams continued to play at the &lt;a href=\"IMG%20Academy\"&gt;IMG Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bradenton%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Bradenton, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, thereby eliminating any home court advantages teams might have had in a normal playoffs. Dates for the playoffs remained largely the same as a normal season. No fans were allowed in the arena during the playoffs.\nBroadcast.\nOn September 8, the league announced that all playoff games will be broadcast on the ESPN family of networks, with games being shown on &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20on%20ABC\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ESPN2\"&gt;ESPN2&lt;/a&gt;. On-air personalities will call the games from ESPN's home campus in &lt;a href=\"Bristol%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Bristol, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; with one reporter on location at &lt;a href=\"IMG%20Academy\"&gt;IMG Academy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Ruocco\"&gt;Ryan Ruocco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pam%20Ward\"&gt;Pam Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rebecca%20Lobo\"&gt;Rebecca Lobo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"LaChina%20Robinson\"&gt;LaChina Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, were announced as the announcers, while &lt;a href=\"Holly%20Rowe\"&gt;Holly Rowe&lt;/a&gt; will be the reporter at IMG Academy.\nPlayoff qualifying.\nLas Vegas earned the first seed by virtue of winning the first tiebreaker over Seattle. Las Vegas lead the head to head matchups 2\u20130.\nFor the fourth straight year, five teams from the Western Conference qualified for the playoffs, while only three from the Eastern Conference qualified. However, this is the first season in the current playoff format where the top five seeds were all from the same conference. All eight teams that qualified were the same eight teams that qualified for the playoffs in &lt;a href=\"2019%20WNBA%20Playoffs\"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayoffs and Finals.\nFirst Round.\nChicago Sky vs. Connecticut Sun.\nThe first playoff game of 2020 saw the 6th seeded &lt;a href=\"2020%20Chicago%20Sky%20season\"&gt;Chicago Sky&lt;/a&gt; play the 7th seeded &lt;a href=\"2020%20Connecticut%20Sun%20season\"&gt;Connecticut Sun&lt;/a&gt;.

The Mercury came into the game after winning at the buzzer on Tuesday. Minnesota came off a five day break after their regular season.
