    "text": "Alan Ayre-Smith (19 August 1876 \u2013 3 November 1957) was an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; international &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; forward who played club rugby for &lt;a href=\"Guy%27s%2C%20Kings%20and%20St.%20Thomas%27%20Rugby%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Guy's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. Ayre-Smith played international rugby for the &lt;a href=\"British%20and%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British Isles&lt;/a&gt; team on its &lt;a href=\"1899%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia\"&gt;1899 tour of Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal history.\nAyre-Smith was born in &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Richmond, Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; in 1876 to Dr Robert Ayre-Smith and Catherine Jane Clarke. He married Meta Turnbull and had one son and two daughters. Ayre-Smith was educated at &lt;a href=\"Durham%20University\"&gt;Durham University&lt;/a&gt;, and gained his degree in Chemistry and Physics. He completed his medical training at &lt;a href=\"Guy%27s%20Hospital\"&gt;Guy's Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in London. In 1900, as part of the British efforts during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Boer%20War\"&gt;Boer War&lt;/a&gt;, he travelled to &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and worked as a dresser in the Imperial Yeomanry Hospital under &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Downing%20Fripp%20%28surgeon%29\"&gt;Dr Alfred Fripp&lt;/a&gt;.\nRugby career.\nAyre-Smith played club rugby for Guy's Hospital, and in 1899 he was selected to join &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Mullineux\"&gt;Matthew Mullineux&lt;/a&gt;'s British Isles team on the first official tour of Australia. Ayre-Smith played in 17 of the 20 tour matches and represented Britain in all four Test Matches against &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. He played in the opening game of the tour, against Central Southern at &lt;a href=\"Goulburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Goulburn, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, before the team headed to &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. There he played against the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs\"&gt;New South Wales Waratahs&lt;/a&gt;, but missed the game against Metropolitan. Ayre-Smith was back in the team for the First Test, which the British Isles lost, 3-13. Ayre-Smith played in six of the seven invitational games between the First and Second Tests, where he was dropped from the game against &lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, but scored his first &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; of the tour in the encounter with Rockhampton. Mullineux reacted to the First Test defeat, by dropping himself from the team, and moving &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Adamson\"&gt;Charlie Adamson&lt;/a&gt; in to his vacated half-back position for the Second Test. This was seen as the turning point of the tour and Ayre-Smith was not only part of a winning British team in the Second Test, but also scored his one and only international try during the game. Ayre-Smith played in both the final Test games, both played in Sydney and both resulting in British victories."
