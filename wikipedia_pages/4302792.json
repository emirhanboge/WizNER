    "text": "The Gainesville, Jefferson and Southern Railroad was a &lt;a href=\"Narrow%20gauge%20railways\"&gt;narrow gauge&lt;/a&gt; railroad in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was chartered in 1872 and upon completion March 11, 1884, consisted of two lines from &lt;a href=\"Gainesville%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Gainesville&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Jefferson%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Social%20Circle%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Social Circle&lt;/a&gt;, splitting at &lt;a href=\"Belmont%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Belmont&lt;/a&gt;. The portion between &lt;a href=\"Monroe%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Monroe&lt;/a&gt; and Social Circle had been acquired and converted that same day from the &lt;a href=\"broad%20gauge\"&gt;broad gauge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Great%20Walton%20Railroad\"&gt;Walton Railroad&lt;/a&gt;.\nBankruptcy forced the railroad into receivership in 1897, and in 1904, most of the track was sold at foreclosure to the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Gainesville%20Midland%20Railway\"&gt;Gainesville Midland Railway&lt;/a&gt;, while the old Walton Railroad became the &lt;a href=\"Monroe%20Railroad%20%281904%E2%80%931975%29\"&gt;Monroe Railroad&lt;/a&gt;, a subsidiary of the &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Railroad\"&gt;Georgia Railroad&lt;/a&gt;. The Gainesville Midland extended the tracks from Jefferson to &lt;a href=\"Athens%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, and was eventually acquired by the &lt;a href=\"Seaboard%20Air%20Line%20Railroad\"&gt;Seaboard Air Line Railroad&lt;/a&gt; in 1959. &lt;a href=\"CSX%20Transportation\"&gt;CSX Transportation&lt;/a&gt; now operates the line, though it remains owned by the &lt;a href=\"Gainesville%20Midland%20Railroad\"&gt;Gainesville Midland Railroad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following communities were stops along the GJ&amp;S, along with their counties:"
