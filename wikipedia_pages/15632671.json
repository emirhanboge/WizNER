    "text": "Along with &lt;a href=\"parasite\"&gt;parasite&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"predation\"&gt;predation&lt;/a&gt; is a threat to &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; health and consequently to the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have very little ability to defend themselves, even when compared with other prey species kept as &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt;. Even if sheep are not directly bitten or survive an attack, they may die from panic or from injuries sustained. \nHowever, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Americas\"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;, and parts of &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; predators can be a serious problem. In contrast, some nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators. Many islands that are known for extensive sheep husbandry are suitable largely because of their predator-free status. \nWorldwide, &lt;a href=\"canid\"&gt;canid&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014including the domestic &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;\u2014are responsible for the majority of sheep deaths. Other animals that prey on sheep include but are not limited to: &lt;a href=\"felidae\"&gt;felines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"birds%20of%20prey\"&gt;birds of prey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Razorback\"&gt;feral hogs&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelation to sheep behavior.\nSheep &lt;a href=\"Flight%20or%20fight\"&gt;flight&lt;/a&gt; behavior is cited in one major study in &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; as the major stimulus responsible for eliciting predatory behavior in &lt;a href=\"coyotes\"&gt;coyotes&lt;/a&gt;. Even coyotes that had not previously been exposed to sheep demonstrated predatory behavior when exposed to them for the first time. Of particular interest was that coyotes with no previous prey-killing experience readily attacked and killed sheep when given the chance. The coyotes were likely to attack sheep that exhibited flight behavior even when these coyotes were not hungry. The same study also determined that dominant coyotes were more likely to attack sheep.\nBy region.\nNorth America.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Agricultural%20Statistics%20Service\"&gt;National Agricultural Statistics Service&lt;/a&gt;, 224,200 sheep were killed in the U.S. by predators in 2004, comprising approximately 37% of all bovine deaths for that year. The sheep lost in that year represented a sum total of 18.3 million dollars for sheep producers. &lt;a href=\"Coyote\"&gt;Coyote&lt;/a&gt;s were responsible for 60.5% of all deaths, with the next largest being domestic dogs at 13.3%. Other North American predators of sheep included &lt;a href=\"cougar\"&gt;cougar&lt;/a&gt;s (5.7%), &lt;a href=\"bobcat\"&gt;bobcat&lt;/a&gt;s (4.9%), &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;s (2.8%), &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s (3.8%), and &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es (1.9%). &lt;a href=\"Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"raven\"&gt;raven&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"New%20World%20vulture\"&gt;vulture&lt;/a&gt;s, and other animals together made up the remaining 7.1% of deaths. As all NASS statistics on sheep only take into account sheep after docking, the American Sheep Industry Association estimates that an additional 50\u201360,000 lambs were killed (before docking) that were not a part of the count. The number of sheep lost to predators may also be higher when considering that reports are generally only made when there is a reasonable expectation that a producer will be financially reimbursed for the loss.\nSouth America.\nIn South America, the only widespread potential predators of sheep are cougars and &lt;a href=\"jaguar\"&gt;jaguar&lt;/a&gt;s, both of which are known to prey on livestock regularly. South American canids such as the &lt;a href=\"Maned%20wolf\"&gt;Maned wolf&lt;/a&gt; and foxes of the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Pseudalopex\"&gt;Pseudalopex&lt;/a&gt;\" are also blamed for sheep deaths, but no evidence for a statistically significant amount of predation by \"most\" of these species has ever been presented. However, the &lt;a href=\"culpeo\"&gt;culpeo&lt;/a&gt; is a threat to sheep, and is responsible for 60% of the predator losses in Patagonia.\nAfrica.\nThough large, the &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South African&lt;/a&gt; sheep industry is significantly hindered by the innumerable predators present in the country. Other African nations that rely on sheep face a similar problem.\n&lt;a href=\"Black-backed%20jackal\"&gt;Black-backed jackal&lt;/a&gt;s are the most significant sheep predators of southern and eastern Africa. Jackal predation typically peaks during droughts when wild food is scarce and the sheep are weakened. &lt;a href=\"Merino\"&gt;Merino&lt;/a&gt; sheep tend to be the most vulnerable, due to their habit of scattering upon attack, unlike fat-tailed sheep which bunch together for defence. In &lt;a href=\"Transvaal%20Province\"&gt;Transvaal&lt;/a&gt; between 1965 and 1971, a study on the stomach contents of over 400 jackals showed that sheep constituted 6% of the diet of jackals living in game reserves, and 27% for those living near farming districts. A similar study in &lt;a href=\"Natal%20%28region%29\"&gt;Natal&lt;/a&gt; revealed that sheep constituted 35% of the resident jackal's diet.\nAustralia and New Zealand.\n The main Australian predator of sheep is the &lt;a href=\"dingo\"&gt;dingo&lt;/a&gt;, which is a large-enough danger to sheep to precipitate the construction of the world's largest fence: the &lt;a href=\"Dingo%20Fence\"&gt;Dingo Fence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Red%20fox\"&gt;Red fox&lt;/a&gt;es, also, may prey on 10-30% of lambs, costing &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;ns sheep breeders more than &lt;a href=\"A%24\"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;100 million annually. \nAnnual &lt;a href=\"bait%20%28luring%20substance%29\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;ing programs are conducted to reduce the number of dingoes and foxes. Uncontrolled domestic dogs also regularly menace and kill sheep. Occasionally &lt;a href=\"wedge-tailed%20eagle\"&gt;wedge-tailed eagle&lt;/a&gt;s will kill young sheep up to and including &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20sheep%20husbandry\"&gt;hogget&lt;/a&gt; size sheep. In contrast, New Zealand has no remaining large &lt;a href=\"carnivore\"&gt;carnivore&lt;/a&gt;s. The only wild animal known to attack sheep in New Zealand is the rare, unusual &lt;a href=\"kea\"&gt;kea&lt;/a&gt; parrot endemic to the country's &lt;a href=\"South%20Island\"&gt;South Island&lt;/a&gt;. Also, &lt;a href=\"feral\"&gt;feral dogs&lt;/a&gt; have been a problem.\nPrior to their extinction in &lt;a href=\"Tasmania\"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"thylacine\"&gt;thylacine&lt;/a&gt; (\"Thylacinus cynocephalus\"), also called the Tasmanian tiger, was also a major predator of sheep.\nBritish Isles.\nBrown bears are thought to have become extinct in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Isles\"&gt;British Isles&lt;/a&gt; in the year 500, while the last wolves were wiped out in 1786. Today the only wild animals remaining as a tangible threat to lambs in the British Isles are the &lt;a href=\"red%20fox\"&gt;red fox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"badger\"&gt;badger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;s. Domestic dogs are also a common cause of predation of lambs and sheep (they can also sometimes die of shock after any attempted predation or attack). There are many anecdotal reports of badgers predating sheep or lambs, but very little solid evidence of attacks. Badgers will scavenge carcasses of animals that have died of other causes and do have the ability to kill lambs but there is little proof that this is anything other than an occasional occurrence. In an independent report on the impact of badgers it was reported that a Scottish survey of sheep farmers in 2019 found that of farmers who thought they had suffered predation 11% were of the opinion that badgers were responsible for some of their losses, although a majority of these did not actually witness an attack. The report also points out that predation (by many species, not just badgers) is often both misidentified and overestimated which makes it difficult to conclude an accurate figure for badger attacks.\nCrows such as the &lt;a href=\"hooded%20crow\"&gt;hooded crow&lt;/a&gt; are known to kill lambs, often first disabling them by pecking out their eyes; if a sheep has fallen over during parturition or bad weather and cannot get up, again crows will first attack their eyes. Larger predatory birds such as &lt;a href=\"golden%20eagles\"&gt;golden eagles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"white-tailed%20eagle\"&gt;white-tailed eagle&lt;/a&gt; may pose a threat to sheep in the north of Britain, where their ranges remain stable, but studies show that overall levels of predation are likely to be low (in the order of 1-3%), although a small number of farmers may occasionally suffer slightly higher losses. \nMainland Europe.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, between April 1989 and June 1991, 21,000 sheep and goats were killed by wolves. In 1998 it was 5,894 sheep and goats.\nIn southern &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"golden%20jackal\"&gt;golden jackal&lt;/a&gt;s were recorded to have attacked 1,053 sheep between 1982\u201387.\nAsia.\nA study on livestock predation taken in &lt;a href=\"Tibet\"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt; showed that the wolf was the most prominent predator, accounting for 60% of the total livestock losses, followed by the &lt;a href=\"snow%20leopard\"&gt;snow leopard&lt;/a&gt; (38%) and &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20lynx\"&gt;Eurasian lynx&lt;/a&gt; (2%). Sheep were the second most targeted victims after goats, amounting to over 30% of losses.\nPrevention.\nSheep producers have used a wide variety of measures to try to combat predation throughout history. Pre-modern shepherds had only the most basic of tools: their own presence, &lt;a href=\"livestock%20guardian%20dogs\"&gt;livestock guardian dogs&lt;/a&gt;, and protective structures such as &lt;a href=\"barn\"&gt;barn&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"fencing\"&gt;fencing&lt;/a&gt;. Fencing (both regular and &lt;a href=\"Electric%20fence\"&gt;electric&lt;/a&gt;), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely\u2013used methods of protection today. Whereas sheepdogs &lt;a href=\"herd\"&gt;herd&lt;/a&gt; sheep, guardian dogs are trained to integrate into flocks and protect them from predators. The ability of these dogs to do so is a transference of the canine &lt;a href=\"Pack%20%28canine%29\"&gt;pack&lt;/a&gt; social structure on to a flock. Following their invention, the focus in dealing with predators shifted to the nearly exclusive use of &lt;a href=\"guns\"&gt;guns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Animal%20trapping\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"poisons\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; to kill predators both defensively and preemptively. The population of predator species plummeted worldwide, pushing some to &lt;a href=\"extinction\"&gt;extinction&lt;/a&gt; (such as the &lt;a href=\"thylacine\"&gt;thylacine&lt;/a&gt;) or significantly reducing their original ranges. With the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"environmentalism\"&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"conservation%20movement\"&gt;conservation movement&lt;/a&gt;s, and subsequent &lt;a href=\"federated%20state\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"province%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;provincial&lt;/a&gt;, national and international legislation, simply exterminating predator species failed to be a legally viable option for protecting flocks. However, many countries maintain government agencies\u2014such as the Wildlife Services program, a wing of the &lt;a href=\"USDA\"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Animal%20and%20Plant%20Health%20Inspection%20Service\"&gt;Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service&lt;/a&gt; \u2014to shoot, poison and trap predators that threaten sheep. Wildlife conservation organizations charge that this killing is both indiscriminate and ineffective at protecting sheep.\nThe 1970s saw an ensuing resurgence in the use of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control, many of them non\u2013lethal. &lt;a href=\"Donkey\"&gt;Donkey&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"guard%20llama\"&gt;guard llama&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"alpaca\"&gt;alpaca&lt;/a&gt;s have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs. Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or &lt;a href=\"horses\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt;, make also help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep. In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non\u2013lethal predator deterrents such as motion\u2013activated lights and noisy alarms. While these devices have been shown to be successful, predators can become habituated to them.\nIn fiction.\nIn the Dick King-Smith novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sheep-Pig\"&gt;The Sheep-Pig&lt;/a&gt;\" and its &lt;a href=\"Babe%20%28film%29\"&gt;1995 film adaptation&lt;/a&gt;, Arthur Hoggett's sheep were attacked by wild dogs with one of them, Maa being killed."
