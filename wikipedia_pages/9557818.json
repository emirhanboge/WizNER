    "text": "Shatin Pui Ying College (), abbreviated as SPYC or PYC, is a &lt;a href=\"Christian%20school\"&gt;Christian school&lt;/a&gt; that was established in 1978. Located in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, SPYC is an &lt;a href=\"Medium%20of%20instruction\"&gt;English medium of instruction&lt;/a&gt; (EMI) secondary school fully subsidised by the government with 4 classes each for Forms 1 to 5 and 5 classes for Form 6 (in the 2018/19 academic year). The school icon is an &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt; symbolising &lt;a href=\"courage\"&gt;courage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"determination\"&gt;determination&lt;/a&gt;.\nSchool history.\n&lt;a href=\"Rev%20Henry%20Noyes\"&gt;Rev Henry Noyes&lt;/a&gt;, the school founder, was a minister of the U.S. Presbyterian Church. In 1879 he founded a beginners' school called An Hwoh School in Saki, &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, offering Mathematics and Science. With a lot of hard work, Pui Ying emerged and bloomed. A chain of schools was established in Guangzhou, &lt;a href=\"Taishan%2C%20Guangdong\"&gt;Taishan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jiangmen\"&gt;Jiangmen&lt;/a&gt; and Hong Kong.\nIn 1978, to celebrate the centennial, the Board of Directors established the 5th school; an Anglo-Chinese School named Shatin Pui Ying College, with &lt;a href=\"Wong%20Wai%20Wah\"&gt;Wong Wai Wah&lt;/a&gt; as the Principal. In the first year, the school operated on the campus of &lt;a href=\"Baptist%20Lui%20Ming%20Choi%20Secondary%20School\"&gt;Baptist Lui Ming Choi Secondary School&lt;/a&gt; at Lek Yuen Estate. In September 1979, the school could at last move into the 24-classroom premises in &lt;a href=\"Wo%20Che\"&gt;Wo Che&lt;/a&gt; Estate. The school &lt;a href=\"library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; was opened in September 1982.\nIn order to enable the promotion of all Form 3 students to Form 4 in the school, the school altered the class structure to a symmetrical one. The &lt;a href=\"Student%20Union\"&gt;Student Union&lt;/a&gt; was set up in September 1995 and &lt;a href=\"Parent-Teacher%20Association\"&gt;Parent-Teacher Association&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. In 1996, Principal Wong retired and was succeeded by Vice Principal &lt;a href=\"Yau%20Oi%20Yuen\"&gt;Yau Oi Yuen&lt;/a&gt;. The mixed ability classes replaced the elite system in September 1996. In September 2015, Principal Yau retired and was succeeded by Vice Principal Chan Lai Fan, while Chan Tak Nam succeeded as Vice Principal.\nThe new wing building of the school has been in use since July 2005. In the new wing, there are classrooms for higher form classes, a new library, and some special rooms.\nOn 9 September 2019, the human chain activity in the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Hong%20Kong%20protests\"&gt;2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests&lt;/a&gt; was launched. Students and alumni of various secondary schools in Hong Kong initiated the chain action to express their determination to fight for the \"five demands\". The students of this school participated. The activity starts at about 7 o'clock in the morning and ends at about 8 o'clock.
