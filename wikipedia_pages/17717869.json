    "text": "Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service (HMDS) is the &lt;a href=\"diplomatic%20service\"&gt;diplomatic service&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, dealing with &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20policy\"&gt;foreign affairs&lt;/a&gt; and representing British interests overseas, as opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Service%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Home Civil Service&lt;/a&gt;, which deals with domestic affairs. It employs around 14,000 people, roughly one-third of whom are crown servants working directly for the &lt;a href=\"Foreign%2C%20Commonwealth%20and%20Development%20Office\"&gt;Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office&lt;/a&gt;, either in London or abroad. The remaining two thirds of staff are employed locally by one of nearly 270 British diplomatic missions abroad (such as embassies, consulates or high commissions). The &lt;a href=\"Permanent%20Under-Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs\"&gt;Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; is also the Head of the Diplomatic Service.\nEntry into the Diplomatic Service is highly competitive. In 2018, 12,266 applicants sought to join the Diplomatic Service fast stream. 71 were successful, representing 0.6% of those who applied. This compares to the general civil service fast stream, also highly competitive, in which 9.1% of candidates were successful. Until around 2009 members of the Diplomatic Service could also formally receive a Royal Commission, signed by the Foreign Secretary and formally by the monarch, as members of a Crown service.\nThe Foreign Service, which originally provided &lt;a href=\"civil%20servant\"&gt;civil servant&lt;/a&gt;s to staff the Foreign Office, was once a separate service, but it amalgamated with the Diplomatic Service in 1918. The Diplomatic Service also absorbed the &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Service\"&gt;Colonial Service&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1960s.\nWomen were not allowed to join the Diplomatic Service until 1946. Until 1973, they were required to leave when they married. The first female ambassador to be appointed was &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Salt\"&gt;Barbara Salt&lt;/a&gt;, to Israel in 1962, but ill-health prevented her from taking up the post. &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%20Emery\"&gt;Eleanor Emery&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20High%20Commissioners%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20Botswana\"&gt;British High Commissioner to Botswana&lt;/a&gt; from 1973 to 1977, corresponding to an ambassador but within the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;. The first woman to serve as an ambassador as such was &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Warburton\"&gt;Anne Warburton&lt;/a&gt;, appointed to Denmark in 1976."
