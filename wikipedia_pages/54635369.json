    "text": "Sicilibba was an &lt;a href=\"Classical%20antiquity\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"civitas\"&gt;Roman town&lt;/a&gt; of the Roman province of &lt;a href=\"proconsular%20Africa\"&gt;proconsular Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The ancient town is tentatively identifiable with the ruins at &lt;a href=\"Alaouine\"&gt;Alaouine&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Alaouenine\"&gt;Alaouenine&lt;/a&gt;) in today's &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSicilibba was also the &lt;a href=\"cathedra\"&gt;seat&lt;/a&gt; of an ancient Christian &lt;a href=\"bishopric\"&gt;bishopric&lt;/a&gt;, suffraged by the Archdiocese of Carthage. There are four known (ancient) bishops of Sicilibba. \nTo these bishops, Morcelli adds the donatist Honorius, mentioned in 337. However, According to Mesnage, it would not be the name of a bishop but of the adjective \"honoratum jugulum\" that is present in the text on which Morcelli leans. In that case it is to merely identify the Honored Bishop.\nToday Sicilibba survives only as a &lt;a href=\"titular%20bishop\"&gt;titular bishop&lt;/a&gt;ric of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, The current bishop is &lt;a href=\"Christoph%20Hegge\"&gt;Christoph Hegge&lt;/a&gt;, auxiliary &lt;a href=\"bishop%20of%20M%C3%BCnster\"&gt;bishop of M\u00fcnster&lt;/a&gt;."
