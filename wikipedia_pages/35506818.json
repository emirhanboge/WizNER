    "text": "The KPL Top 8 Cup (also known as the KPL Top 8 Knockout, the KPL Top 8 Knockout Cup or simply the Top 8 Knockout, the Top 8 Cup or the Kenyan Top 8 Cup) is a Kenyan &lt;a href=\"Football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; championship contested by the top eight teams of the preceding &lt;a href=\"Kenyan%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Kenyan Premier League&lt;/a&gt; (KPL) season. The inaugural edition of the tournament took place in &lt;a href=\"2011%20KPL%20Top%208%20Cup\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Ulinzi%20Stars\"&gt;Ulinzi Stars&lt;/a&gt; as the winners.\nFormat.\nThe tournament is played in both a &lt;a href=\"Single-elimination%20tournament\"&gt;single-elimination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Double-elimination%20tournament\"&gt;double-elimination&lt;/a&gt; format. It begins with the quarter-finals, where teams play against each other once. In the semi-finals, teams play each other in &lt;a href=\"Two-legged%20tie\"&gt;two matches&lt;/a&gt; and the team with more goals &lt;a href=\"Aggregate%20score\"&gt;on aggregate&lt;/a&gt; advances to the final, which is played once. No &lt;a href=\"third%20place%20playoff\"&gt;third place playoff&lt;/a&gt; is played.\nThe winners of the tournament receive a total sum of &lt;a href=\"Kenya%20shilling\"&gt;Ksh.&lt;/a&gt; 1,000,000 as prize money, although appeals to the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Kenya%20Federation\"&gt;Football Kenya Federation&lt;/a&gt; have been made to increase the sum as gate collections in the tournament surpass the prize money amount."
