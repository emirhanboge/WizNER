The population was 5,470 at the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe city of Jordan began on November 27, 1853, when &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20A.%20Holmes\"&gt;Thomas A. Holmes&lt;/a&gt; ordered the construction of a sawmill. This establishment gave Jordan its first name, Holmes Mill.\nA year after the mill's founding, Thomas's brother William Holmes moved to the site and began &lt;a href=\"plat\"&gt;plat&lt;/a&gt;ting a settlement. By 1855, he successfully surveyed and recorded his settlement as Jordan City, after the &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20River\"&gt;Jordan River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Palestine%20%28region%29\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;. Jordan City accumulated some success in 1855 and 1856 with the addition of a post office and a handful of a businesses.\nIn 1860, the neighboring settlement of Brentwood was surveyed by S. A. Hooper, J. H. Gardner and R. W. Thomas. The two settlements competed until a legislative action consolidated them into the village of Jordan in 1872. The consolidation only helped the settlement and by 1880 the population had boomed to 915 along with a boom in businesses in the village. A few of these businesses were breweries, which became especially successful until prohibition in 1919 temporarily caused their closure.\nJordan was finally incorporated as a city in 1891.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water.\n&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%20169%20in%20Minnesota\"&gt;U.S. Highway 169&lt;/a&gt;, and State Highways &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20State%20Highway%2021\"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20State%20Highway%20282\"&gt;282&lt;/a&gt; are three of the main routes in the community.\nThe architects and civil engineers known for designing the layout of the streets of Jordan, also founded the neighboring town of &lt;a href=\"Belle%20Plaine%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Belle Plaine&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemographics.\n2010 census.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2010, there were 5,470 people, 1,871 households, and 1,428 families living in the city.
