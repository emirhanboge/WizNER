    "text": "Cobden is a village in &lt;a href=\"Union%20County%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Union County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, within the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Illinois\"&gt;Southern Illinois&lt;/a&gt; region informally known as \"Little Egypt.\u201d The population as of the 2020 census is 1,034, a decline of 10.63% since the 2010 census. Cobden is regionally known for the mascot of its public school district, Cobden Unit School District #17, called the \"Appleknockers,\u201d which has been voted as one of the most unique high school mascots in the country by numerous publications.\nThe area around Cobden is widely known for its many &lt;a href=\"Winery\"&gt;wineries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orchard\"&gt;orchard&lt;/a&gt;s, most notably Flamm Orchards, which is just north of town, and Rendleman Orchard in nearby &lt;a href=\"Alto%20Pass%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Alto Pass, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe village is named after &lt;a href=\"British%20people\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; politician &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Cobden\"&gt;Richard Cobden&lt;/a&gt;, who visited the town in 1859. An early variant name was \"South Pass\".\nCobden began as an agricultural town and developed around the tracks of a route owned by the &lt;a href=\"Illinois%20Central%20Railroad\"&gt;Illinois Central Railroad&lt;/a&gt; (now owned by &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20National%20Railway\"&gt;Canadian National Railway&lt;/a&gt;), as well as being along a main highway, &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Highway%2051\"&gt;U.S. Highway 51&lt;/a&gt;, running through the region.\nGeography.\nCobden is located at (37.533949, -89.255409).\nCobden lies 13.7 miles south of &lt;a href=\"Carbondale%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Carbondale, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and just north of the towns of &lt;a href=\"Anna%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Anna, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jonesboro%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Jonesboro, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, along Old U.S Highway 51, which runs straight through town. Nearby &lt;a href=\"Alto%20Pass%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Alto Pass, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; lies 5.1 miles to the northwest. \nAccording to the 2010 census, Cobden has a total area of , of which (or 99.27%) is land and (or 0.73%) is water.\nCobden is located near the crest of the &lt;a href=\"Shawnee%20Hill\"&gt;Shawnee Hill&lt;/a&gt;s. It is in \"Cobden Col\", a valley cut into rock by water near the summit of this ancient mountain range. Approximately 100,000 years ago, the &lt;a href=\"Illinoian%20%28stage%29\"&gt;Illinoian ice sheet&lt;/a&gt; covered almost all of Illinois. As it pushed south, the ice sheet climbed the Shawnee Mountains. The height of the ice sheet was much greater than that of the mountains. It stopped before it reached their summits. As it melted, a lake formed between the mountains and the glacier. Cobden Col was the outlet of this lake.\nMascot.\nCobden's claim to fame is its unique &lt;a href=\"mascot\"&gt;mascot&lt;/a&gt;, an Appleknocker, or a man with freckles wearing overalls, a flannel shirt, a straw hat, and chewing on a piece of straw. This nickname originated when the &lt;a href=\"High%20school%20%28North%20America%29\"&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt; first began to compete in athletics. It did not yet have a mascot, so other schools made up this derogatory term to insult the new school because of their large industry in &lt;a href=\"peach\"&gt;peach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orchard\"&gt;orchard&lt;/a&gt;s. However, when Cobden High School played for and lost the state &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt; championship in 1964, this name was cemented in the town's history and became part of its cultural identity.\nDemographics.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2000, there were 1,116 people, 421 households, and 276 families residing in the village.
