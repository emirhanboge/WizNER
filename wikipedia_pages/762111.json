    "title": "Crocodile clip",
    "text": "A crocodile clip (also alligator clip) is a sprung metal clip with long, serrated jaws which is used for creating a temporary &lt;a href=\"electrical%20connection\"&gt;electrical connection&lt;/a&gt;. This simple mechanical device gets its name from the resemblance of its jaws to those of an &lt;a href=\"alligator\"&gt;alligator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"crocodile\"&gt;crocodile&lt;/a&gt;. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded &lt;a href=\"clothespin\"&gt;clothespin&lt;/a&gt;, the clip's tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a &lt;a href=\"spring%20%28device%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; to grip an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~ female &lt;a href=\"banana%20connector\"&gt;banana jack&lt;/a&gt;, enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another &lt;a href=\"electrical%20circuit\"&gt;electrical circuit&lt;/a&gt;. The clip is typically covered by a plastic shroud or \"boot\" to prevent accidental short-circuits.\nSmall versions, ranging in size from in length, are used in electrical &lt;a href=\"laboratory\"&gt;laboratory&lt;/a&gt; work. \nLarge versions of these clips, called automotive clips or battery clamps, are made of solid &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt; for low &lt;a href=\"electrical%20resistance\"&gt;electrical resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and are used with thick insulated copper cables to make connections between automobile batteries. These &lt;a href=\"jumper%20cable\"&gt;jumper cable&lt;/a&gt;s (a.k.a. 'jump leads') are capable of delivering hundreds of Amperes of current needed to directly power an automobile starter motor, or to transfer energy from a charged &lt;a href=\"lead%E2%80%93acid%20battery\"&gt;lead\u2013acid battery&lt;/a&gt; to a discharged one.\nSpecifications.\nThe United States Defense Logistics Agency specifies several types of electrical clips in Commercial Item Description (CID) A-A-59466. In this CID document, crocodile clips are designated type CC, alligator clips are designated types TCx, and other types of electrical clips have various other, unique designations.\nKelvin clip.\nA &lt;a href=\"Kelvin%20clip\"&gt;Kelvin clip&lt;/a&gt; is a special form of crocodile clip. The jaws of a Kelvin clip are insulated from each other, allowing two isolated wires to connect to a single test point. This enables &lt;a href=\"four-terminal%20sensing\"&gt;4-wire measurement&lt;/a&gt; of circuits with very low resistances."
