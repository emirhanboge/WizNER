    "text": "The Via Alpina is a network of five long-distance hiking trails across the &lt;a href=\"Alps\"&gt;alpine&lt;/a&gt; regions of &lt;a href=\"Slovenia\"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liechtenstein\"&gt;Liechtenstein&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Monaco\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;. The longest of trails is the red trail, whose termini are in &lt;a href=\"Trieste\"&gt;Trieste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Monaco\"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Via Alpina was created by a group of public and private organisations from the 8 Alpine countries in 2000, receiving EU funding from 2001 until 2008. It was initiated by the Association &lt;a href=\"Grande%20Travers%C3%A9e%20des%20Alpes\"&gt;Grande Travers\u00e9e des Alpes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grenoble\"&gt;Grenoble&lt;/a&gt;, which hosted the Via Alpina international secretariat until January 2014, when it was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Commission%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20the%20Alps\"&gt;International Commission for the Protection of the Alps&lt;/a&gt; CIPRA (Liechtenstein). There are national secretariats (hosted by public administrations or hiking associations) in each country. Its aim is to support sustainable development in remote mountain areas and promote the Alpine cultures and cultural exchanges.\nGreen Trail.\nThe Via Alpina green trail follows the Swiss National Route no. 1 (previously known as the &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20Pass%20Route\"&gt;Swiss Alpine Pass Route&lt;/a&gt;) from Sargans to Lenk, which then continues over a further four passes to &lt;a href=\"Montreux\"&gt;Montreux&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlue Trail.\nFrom D11 to D51, coinciding to a large extent with the &lt;a href=\"Piedmont\"&gt;Piedmont&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;a href=\"Grande%20Traversata%20delle%20Alpi\"&gt;Grande Traversata delle Alpi&lt;/a&gt; (GTA).\nRed Trail.\nThe longest trail, crossing all 8 countries."
