Townlands originated in &lt;a href=\"Gaelic%20Ireland\"&gt;Gaelic Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, and predate the late-12th-century &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Norman%20invasion%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Anglo-Norman invasion&lt;/a&gt;. However, some townland names (and boundaries) are derived from British &lt;a href=\"Plantations%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;plantations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Normans%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt; manors.\nAughoose.\n Aughoose () is on the D\u00fan Chiort\u00e1in peninsula overlooking the lower reaches of &lt;a href=\"Sruwaddacon%20Bay\"&gt;Sruwaddacon Bay&lt;/a&gt; (Sruth Fada Conn), and has an area of . There was a small chapel along the stream at Lenamore during the 18th century, a rare sight due to the contemporary &lt;a href=\"Penal%20Laws\"&gt;Penal Laws&lt;/a&gt;. Until the 1950s, Aughoose had a dance hall. A &lt;a href=\"lace%20school\"&gt;lace school&lt;/a&gt; was organised by the &lt;a href=\"Congested%20Districts%20Board%20for%20Ireland\"&gt;Congested Districts Board&lt;/a&gt;; The schools were at their peak during the World Wars (when they made uniform buttons and other goods for armies serving abroad), later turning to knitted and crocheted goods. The local headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Georgina%20Ward%2C%20Countess%20of%20Dudley\"&gt;Lady Dudley&lt;/a&gt; Nursing Scheme was in Aughoose during the early 20th century, and the nurses cared for patients throughout the parish. In the early 1970s, the nursing scheme was absorbed into the Health Services. Aughoose is near Bellanaboy and its proposed above-ground &lt;a href=\"Corrib%20gas%20project%23Pipeline\"&gt;Corrib Gas pipeline&lt;/a&gt;. Although the people of Aughoose are opposed to the project, a large portion of Lenamore has been sold to Shell.\nBarnatra.\nBarnatra () straddles the parishes of Kilcommon and Kilmore at the lower end of &lt;a href=\"Broadhaven%20Bay\"&gt;Broadhaven Bay&lt;/a&gt;. On a crossroads, its roads lead west into &lt;a href=\"Belmullet\"&gt;Belmullet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mullet%20Peninsula\"&gt;Mullet Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, north through the Dun Chaoch\u00e1in peninsula to &lt;a href=\"Glengad\"&gt;Glengad&lt;/a&gt; and Pollathomas, east to &lt;a href=\"Glenamoy\"&gt;Glenamoy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9ide%20Fields\"&gt;C\u00e9ide Fields&lt;/a&gt; and south to &lt;a href=\"Carrowmore%20Lake\"&gt;Carrowmore Lake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bangor%20Erris\"&gt;Bangor Erris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Castlebar\"&gt;Castlebar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ballina%2C%20County%20Mayo\"&gt;Ballina&lt;/a&gt;, about away.\nBellanaboy.\nBellanaboy () covers an area of , most of which is now enclosed around a &lt;a href=\"Corrib%20gas%20controversy\"&gt;fossil-fuel refinery&lt;/a&gt; under heavy security which has been built by &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dutch%20Shell\"&gt;Royal Dutch Shell&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coillte\"&gt;Coillte&lt;/a&gt;-controlled &lt;a href=\"conifer\"&gt;conifer&lt;/a&gt; plantation land. The townland is at the south-eastern point of the Sruwaddacon Bay estuary. The Aughoose River, also known as the Yellow River, flows through Bellanaboy on its way to &lt;a href=\"Carrowmore%20Lake\"&gt;Carrowmore Lake&lt;/a&gt;, which supplies Erris' drinking water. Along the riverbed is the soft yellow subsoil which gives the townland its name. Bellanaboy has been flooded a number of times, with fatalities.\nCarrowteige.\n&lt;a href=\"Carrowteige\"&gt;Carrowteige&lt;/a&gt; () is a &lt;a href=\"Gaeltacht\"&gt;Gaeltacht&lt;/a&gt; village near the end of the D\u00fan Chaoch\u00e1in peninsula. It has a Catholic church, a &lt;a href=\"National%20school%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;national school&lt;/a&gt;, and a shop. &lt;a href=\"Comhar%20D%C3%BAn%20Chaoch%C3%A1in%20Teo\"&gt;Comhar D\u00fan Chaoch\u00e1in Teo&lt;/a&gt; is based in the village, and marked cliff walks begin there.\nCill Ghallagh\u00e1in.\nCill Ghallag\u00e1in (English: Kilgalligan) is on the northern tip of the Dun Chiort\u00e1in peninsula, and a small village bears its name. Wild and rugged, it overlooks &lt;a href=\"Broadhaven%20Bay\"&gt;Broadhaven Bay&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Cill Ghallag\u00e1in is noted for its &lt;a href=\"Cill%20Ghallag%C3%A1in%23Microtoponymy\"&gt;microtoponymy&lt;/a&gt; and its seventh-century &lt;a href=\"Comhar%20D%C3%BAn%20Chaoch%C3%A1in%20Teo%23Achievements\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt; on the north side of &lt;a href=\"Sruwaddacon%20Bay\"&gt;Sruwaddacon Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nCornboy.\nCornboy is a coastal townland on the D\u00fan Chaoch\u00e1in peninsula, covering . The village centre is inland, near Garter Hill. It had surrounded the old chapel on the hill overlooking &lt;a href=\"Broadhaven%20Bay\"&gt;Broadhaven Bay&lt;/a&gt;, but blowing sand moved residents inland from Cornboy Pier and its sand dunes.\nAn area known as Sandhills Settlement contains evidence of Iron Age human settlement, possibly &lt;a href=\"cairn\"&gt;cairn&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"midden\"&gt;midden&lt;/a&gt;s, with large sand dunes and sandy beaches. The Gweedaney River rises at Portacloy and flows past the old chapel in the dunes into Sruwaddacon Bay; the modern church is farther inland. Cornboy shares Knockadaff mountain with Garter Hill. Knockadaff was an electoral district of the &lt;a href=\"Belmullet\"&gt;Belmullet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"poor%20law%20union\"&gt;poor law union&lt;/a&gt; and an administrative division of Erris. A walking loop climbs Garter Hill through fields and the seashore.\nCornhill.\nCornhill () is a village on Dooncarton Hill, overlooking Sruwaddacon Bay. It has a number of fields for grazing, and the Dooncarton Hill radar tower (widely considered an &lt;a href=\"eyesore\"&gt;eyesore&lt;/a&gt;) is in front of the village. Many have said that the radar tower is an eyesore and should be taken down but it is still standing. The &lt;a href=\"Linear%20settlement\"&gt;linear village&lt;/a&gt; has about a dozen houses.\nFaulagh.\nFaulagh () is a village on the southern slope of the mountain of the same name which overlooks &lt;a href=\"Carrowmore%20Lake\"&gt;Carrowmore Lake&lt;/a&gt;. The village, on the north side of lake, is a remote, largely &lt;a href=\"bog\"&gt;bog&lt;/a&gt;gy area. Faulagh has a number of prehistoric megaliths and &lt;a href=\"Field%20system%23Ireland\"&gt;field systems&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlenamoy.\nGlenamoy () is the general name for nine Kilcommon townlands: Bellagelly North and South, Baralty, Bunalty, Gortleatilla, Srahnaplaia, Pollboy, Lenarevagh and &lt;a href=\"Barroosky\"&gt;Barroosky&lt;/a&gt;. It covers about , much of it inaccessible &lt;a href=\"blanket%20bog\"&gt;blanket bog&lt;/a&gt; interspersed with conifer forests and small lakes. Glenamoy is inland from the parish's coastal townlands. The &lt;a href=\"Glenamoy%20River\"&gt;Glenamoy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Owenmore%20River%20%28County%20Mayo%29\"&gt;Owenmore Rivers&lt;/a&gt; rivers rise in the nearby mountains; the Owenmore flows into &lt;a href=\"Blacksod%20Bay\"&gt;Blacksod Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and the Glenamoy into &lt;a href=\"Broadhaven%20Bay\"&gt;Broadhaven Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Lace schools were common in the area, and 19th-century landlords hosted shooting parties for the gentry at several area &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20and%20shooting%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Hunting%20lodge\"&gt;hunting lodges&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlengad.\nGlengad, also known as Dooncarton (), is a large townland on the northwestern shore of Sruwaddacon Bay. Its name is derived from willows (\"gads\") from the &lt;a href=\"Cromwellian%20conquest%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Cromwellian period&lt;/a&gt; when the native Irish were sent \"to hell or to &lt;a href=\"Connacht\"&gt;Connaught&lt;/a&gt;\". The settlers who came to Glengad brought the craft of basket weaving, planting willows in wet ground; willows have grown in the townland's streams ever since. It is a linear village, with houses and farms along the main road. The land was divided by the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Land%20Commission\"&gt;Irish Land Commission&lt;/a&gt; during the early 20th century; each farm is a narrow strip running from the mountain to the sea, a remnant of the &lt;a href=\"rundale\"&gt;rundale&lt;/a&gt; system of land division seen in many areas of the parish. Glengad is the hub of much of the &lt;a href=\"Corrib%20gas%20controversy\"&gt;Corrib gas controversy&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlinsk.\n&lt;a href=\"Glinsk%2C%20County%20Mayo\"&gt;Glinsk&lt;/a&gt; () is a remote townland. Glinsk Mountain is covered with blanket bog and rises steeply to overlook &lt;a href=\"Broadhaven%20Bay\"&gt;Broadhaven Bay&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Broadhaven%20Bay%23Stags%20of%20Broadhaven\"&gt;Stags of Broadhaven&lt;/a&gt; from cliffs along &lt;a href=\"Benwee%20Head\"&gt;Benwee Head&lt;/a&gt;. The ruins of a 1798 English watchtower are on the mountain's southern slope. Covering an area of , the townland is presently uninhabited; the road past it was first tarred in 2004.\nGortbrack.\nGortbrack (), occupying a large section of the south side of the western peninsula, covers an area of in size. The Owenduff River flows through the townland, which is of archaeological interest due to its location along the southern coastal slopes and its numerous &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; megaliths.\nGortmelia.\n Gortmelia (), on the west side of the D\u00fan Chiort\u00e1in peninsula overlooking Inver Bay, covers an area of . In the \"Tithe Composition Book\" of 1834, Gortmelia was divided into three parts: Gortmelia Mills, Gortmellia Gallagher and Rookstown. In the later rateable valuation books, the three areas are called Gortmellia Mills, Gortmellia Gallagher and Gortmellia Houston. The townland presently has four areas: Gortmellia, Parkbaun, Ballur and Ballyhonry.\nInver.\nInver (), covering an area of , is on the western side of the D\u00fan Chiort\u00e1n peninsula overlooking Tr\u00e1 Kirtaan (Chiort\u00e1in's Beach). The Owenduff River flows through Knocknalower and Inver to &lt;a href=\"Broadhaven%20Bay\"&gt;Broadhaven Bay&lt;/a&gt;. In 1636, Michael Cormuck lived in Inver Castle near the shore. Although Cormuck claimed much of the land in Erris, the Protestant bishop had (according to the Stafford Inquisition of Mayo, which investigated early-17th-century land ownership in the county) the \"right of the sea all around Erris\". The castle had crumbled by 1802, and little remains except its gateposts. Inver features in the story of the &lt;a href=\"T%C3%A1in%20B%C3%B3%20Flidhais\"&gt;T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Flidhais&lt;/a&gt;; a mound is said to be the burial site of &lt;a href=\"Flidais\"&gt;Flidhais&lt;/a&gt;' husband when he was stranded by Chiortain, for whom the peninsula is named.\nPollathomas.\nOn the D\u00fan Chiort\u00e1in peninsula and also known as Poll a tS\u00f3mais, Pollatomais, Kilcommon, Pullathomas (the most common spelling) and Pollatomish, Pollathomas covers an area of . The village straddles a small crossroads and overlooks &lt;a href=\"Sruwaddacon%20Bay\"&gt;Sruwaddacon Bay&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Normans\"&gt;Anglo-Normans&lt;/a&gt; came to Ireland, several slayings were recorded by the native tribespeople. In 1585, during the &lt;a href=\"English%20Reformation\"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, Pollathomas became the property of the Protestant &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Killala\"&gt;Bishop of Killala&lt;/a&gt; and Michael Cormuck (who lived in Inver Castle) was the lessee. Several religious settlers, including the &lt;a href=\"Augustinians\"&gt;Augustinians&lt;/a&gt;, were driven out of the area during the 17th-century Penal Laws period. In 1770, Pollathomas and &lt;a href=\"Glengad\"&gt;Glengad&lt;/a&gt; were leased from the Protestant Bishop by the O'Donels of &lt;a href=\"Termon\"&gt;Termon&lt;/a&gt;. Due to its increased population, Pollathomas had several famines during the early 19th century before the 1845-47 &lt;a href=\"Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Great Famine&lt;/a&gt;. During that famine, residents ate seaweed and seagull eggs; landlord James O'Donel was attacked at a local lodge, and trained &lt;a href=\"crow\"&gt;crow&lt;/a&gt;s to protect his property.\nPortacloy.\nPortacloy ( on the north of the D\u00fan Chaoch\u00e1in peninsula, covers an area of on the western boundary of Porturlin. The townland is on a horseshoe-shaped bay with two piers and several cliff walks. With the nearest shop in &lt;a href=\"Carrowteige\"&gt;Carrowteige&lt;/a&gt;, it has the remnants of a &lt;a href=\"promontory%20fort\"&gt;promontory fort&lt;/a&gt; and an English &lt;a href=\"watchtower\"&gt;watchtower&lt;/a&gt; here. In 1909, a pier and &lt;a href=\"Breakwater%20%28structure%29\"&gt;breakwater&lt;/a&gt; were built to facilitate a fish-curing station built several years earlier to process &lt;a href=\"mackerel\"&gt;mackerel&lt;/a&gt;. During the 1960s, a second small pier was built.\nPorturlin.\nPorturlin (), on the east coast of the D\u00fan Chaoch\u00e1in peninsula, covers an area of . During the Great Famine, Richard Webb (who was bringing relief from the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Friends\"&gt;Society of Friends&lt;/a&gt;) called it the finest fishing grounds in Mayo but added: \"The only access by land is over a high and boggy mountain, so wet and swampy that it is difficult to reach it even in summer. There is probably not in Ireland a cluster of human habitations so completely secluded from easy access\u00a0...\". When &lt;a href=\"William%20Bald\"&gt;William Bald&lt;/a&gt; improved the Erris area in 1835, he recommended building piers in Porturlin and Portacloy to aid local fishermen. During the 1840s, roads were built in the area. In 1886, the Roads and Harbour Commission built a &lt;a href=\"Landing%20%28water%20transport%29\"&gt;landing&lt;/a&gt; at a cost of \u00a3204. The &lt;a href=\"Congested%20Districts%20Board%20for%20Ireland\"&gt;Congested Districts Board for Ireland&lt;/a&gt; erected a curing station for herring and mackerel in 1894. By 1952 the old pier had fallen into disrepair, and it was replaced in 1965 by the &lt;a href=\"Mayo%20County%20Council\"&gt;Mayo County Council&lt;/a&gt;. In June 2009, fisherman Pat O'Donnell reported that his boat was sunk by armed men allegedly connected to the Corrib gas project.\nRossport.\nRossport (), covering an area of , has a national school and the Gaelic-speaking Colaiste Chomain secondary school. The construction of a bridge connecting Rossport and the D\u00fan Chiort\u00e1in peninsula has been proposed. The tides of &lt;a href=\"Sruwaddacon%20Bay\"&gt;Sruwaddacon Bay&lt;/a&gt; are hazardous, as described in a song lyric:&lt;poem&gt;\n \"The Rossport Ferry and its rapid current\n\"The second strongest that our State possesses&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe townland has been the scene of protests against the &lt;a href=\"Corrib%20gas%20project\"&gt;Corrib gas project&lt;/a&gt;.\nSrahataggle.\nSrahataggle (), covering an area of , is a remote village; in 2004, a road connecting it to Belderrig was tarred for the first time. The \"&lt;a href=\"Western%20People\"&gt;Western People&lt;/a&gt;\" reported during the early 1950s, \"Remote as these habitations may appear to many, there is no lack of worldly knowledge and cultural attainments and many of their sons and daughters have risen to important posts in countries beyond the seas\"."
