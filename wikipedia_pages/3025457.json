    "title": "Toronto Harbour Commission Building",
    "text": "The Toronto Harbour Commission Building is a six-storey &lt;a href=\"building\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; erected in 1917 in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; by Alfred Chapman for the locally run &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Harbour%20Commission\"&gt;Toronto Harbour Commission&lt;/a&gt;. It was also used by its successor agency &lt;a href=\"PortsToronto\"&gt;PortsToronto&lt;/a&gt;, a federal agency formerly known as the Toronto Port Authority. The lower floor is home to Harbour Sixty Steakhouse.\nFormerly sitting on the waterfront, infill over the years has left the building on dry land, and civic expansion has left it dwarfed by nearby buildings.\nSince 1953, the building has been rumoured to be &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Ahaunted\"&gt;haunted&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; of Thomas Cates, its former &lt;a href=\"janitor\"&gt;janitor&lt;/a&gt;, who died of natural causes while working his night shift. He is most often seen in glimpses in the north-western stairwell, where he will be sweeping or mopping the floor.\nThe building was sold by PortsToronto in 2017 for million to developer Oxford Properties. It is to be part of a commercial office development named \"The Hub\". It was originally built at a cost of $247,000."
