    "text": "Psalm 136 is the 136th &lt;a href=\"psalm\"&gt;psalm&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Psalms\"&gt;Book of Psalms&lt;/a&gt;. In the slightly different numbering system in the Greek &lt;a href=\"Septuagint\"&gt;Septuagint&lt;/a&gt; version of the Bible, and in its Latin translation, the &lt;a href=\"Vulgate\"&gt;Vulgate&lt;/a&gt;, this psalm is Psalm 135. It is sometimes referred to as \"The Great Hallel\". \nUses.\nJudaism.\nThe term Great &lt;a href=\"Hallel\"&gt;Hallel&lt;/a&gt; (), meaning \"great praise\", is used to refer to Psalm 136. It is called \"great\" to differentiate it from the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20Hallel\"&gt;Egyptian Hallel&lt;/a&gt;, another prayer of praise comprising psalms 113 to 118. In the Talmud, opinions vary whether Great Hallel includes only Psalm 136, or else chapters 135-136, or else chapters 134-136; the accepted opinion is that it only includes 136.\nVerse 1,\nwas recited at &lt;a href=\"Solomon\"&gt;Solomon&lt;/a&gt;'s dedication of the &lt;a href=\"Solomon%27s%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Spurgeon\"&gt;Charles Spurgeon&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the whole psalm was sung.\nCoptic Orthodox.\nThis Psalm is chanted as the second Canticle or the second Hoos of the Midnight Praises known as &lt;a href=\"Tasbeha\"&gt;Tasbeha&lt;/a&gt;, a nightly prayer practiced in &lt;a href=\"Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Coptic Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;es and Monasteries.\nMusical Settings.\nVerses 1-15 were set by &lt;a href=\"Roxanna%20Panufnik\"&gt;Roxanna Panufnik&lt;/a&gt; as \"Love Endureth\" in 2012. \"Forever\", written by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Tomlin\"&gt;Chris Tomlin&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, also draws heavily on this Psalm for its lyrics."
