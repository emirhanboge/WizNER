After surviving World War I, she was sold for &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;scrap&lt;/a&gt; in 1920.\nDesign and description.\n\"A12\" was a member of the &lt;a href=\"A-class%20submarine%20%281903%29\"&gt;first British class of submarines&lt;/a&gt;, although slightly larger, faster and more heavily armed than the &lt;a href=\"lead%20ship\"&gt;lead ship&lt;/a&gt;, . The submarine had a length of &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;overall&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a mean &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28ship%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . They &lt;a href=\"displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; on the surface and submerged. The A-class submarines had a crew of 2 officers and 9 &lt;a href=\"naval%20rating\"&gt;ratings&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor surface running, the boats were powered by a single 16-cylinder &lt;a href=\"Wolseley%20Motors\"&gt;Wolseley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"petrol%20engine\"&gt;petrol engine&lt;/a&gt; that drove one &lt;a href=\"propeller%20shaft\"&gt;propeller shaft&lt;/a&gt;.

They could carry a pair of reload torpedoes, but generally did not as they would have to remove an equal weight of fuel in compensation.\nConstruction and career.\n\"A12\" was ordered as part of the 1903\u201304 Naval Programme from at &lt;a href=\"Vickers\"&gt;Vickers&lt;/a&gt;. She was laid down at the &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Barrow-in-Furness\"&gt;Barrow-in-Furness&lt;/a&gt; in 1903, &lt;a href=\"Ship%20naming%20and%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 3 March 1905 and completed on 23 September."
