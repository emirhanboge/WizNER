    "text": "The K&amp;A Gang (currently known as the Northeast Philly &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Mob\"&gt;Irish Mob&lt;/a&gt;) is a predominantly &lt;a href=\"Irish%20American\"&gt;Irish American&lt;/a&gt; criminal network based in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. The K&amp;A &lt;a href=\"Gang\"&gt;Gang&lt;/a&gt; was started following &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and controlled the city's &lt;a href=\"Irish%20mob\"&gt;Irish-American criminal underworld&lt;/a&gt; for much of the late 20th century. The group was mainly a &lt;a href=\"burglary\"&gt;burglary&lt;/a&gt; ring for much of its early history, but shifted into &lt;a href=\"Loan%20shark\"&gt;loansharking&lt;/a&gt;, gambling, and ultimately &lt;a href=\"drug%20trafficking\"&gt;drug trafficking&lt;/a&gt; in its later existence. The name \"K&amp;A\" is derived from &lt;a href=\"West%20Kensington%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Kensington and Allegheny&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Intersection%20%28road%29\"&gt;road intersection&lt;/a&gt; where the gang originally formed.\nDomestically, the network is known to have ties to various criminal organizations in its surrounding area. They are known to have amicable ties to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Mafia\"&gt;La Cosa Nostra&lt;/a&gt;, namely the &lt;a href=\"Scarfo%20crime%20family\"&gt;Scarfo crime family&lt;/a&gt;, but also the &lt;a href=\"Genovese%20crime%20family%20New%20Jersey%20faction\"&gt;South Jersey faction&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"Genovese%20crime%20family\"&gt;Genovese crime family&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Greek%20Mob\"&gt;local Greek mob&lt;/a&gt;, local &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Mafia\"&gt;Jewish-American gangsters&lt;/a&gt;, and various independent drug and hijacking gangs of various European &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20group\"&gt;ethnicities&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20Valley\"&gt;Greater Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; area. They are also said to have ties to the &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20IRA\"&gt;Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; and the larger &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Movement%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Irish republican movement&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBeginnings as a burglary ring.\nFrom the post-war 1950s to the 1970s, members of the network were tied to &lt;a href=\"burglary\"&gt;burglaries&lt;/a&gt; and theft operations all along the &lt;a href=\"East%20coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;East Coast&lt;/a&gt;. While most of their work was around the &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20Valley\"&gt;Philadelphia area&lt;/a&gt;, they ventured out from their turf since the group's inception. A favored target was the wealthy residential &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20American\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; suburbs, which would be the livelihood of the group for many years. The crew was adamant about not carrying weapons with them while they burglarized. This was largely due to the liability of increased jail time if caught with a firearm. They also traded the clich\u00e9 burglary attire for professional suits, while on the job, in case they were stopped. In those days, there was no overarching structure within the gang. It was horizontal in nature, there being several prominent \"crew chiefs\" who held influence.\nTheir reach even extended outside the boundaries of &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; as they targeted other ventures. In &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, several members were known as the \"Hallmark Gang\" and would collaborate with the &lt;a href=\"Dixie%20Mafia\"&gt;Dixie Mafia&lt;/a&gt;. They are also allegedly responsible for the Pottsville Heist in 1959. George Holmes alleges that a showgirl named Lillian Reis and Vickie Mason(AKA, Viola Lorenzo) gave the gang the tip they needed to pilfer $478,000 in cash and jewelry from the home of John B. Rich. Lillian \"Tiger Lil\" Reis and Her good friend Vickie were well-known nightclub entrepreneurs and former showgirls who had ties to the gangsters.\nExpansion into the methamphetamine trade.\nBy the late 1970s, with the advent of modern &lt;a href=\"burglar%20alarm\"&gt;home-security technologies&lt;/a&gt;, the burglary racket was no longer viable as a main source of income. With the rise of the drug culture of the 1980s, the group began to focus less on their signature brand of thievery and more towards traditional &lt;a href=\"Racket%20%28crime%29\"&gt;criminal schemes&lt;/a&gt; and the booming &lt;a href=\"methamphetamine\"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; trade. This was largely due to the immense profit that was available due to the high demand in the area.\nBy the early 1980s, Frank \"The Beard\" Zappacosta and John Carlyle Berkery had close ties with &lt;a href=\"Angelo%20Bruno\"&gt;Angelo Bruno&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20Martorano\"&gt;Raymond Martorano&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scarfo%20crime%20family\"&gt;Philadelphia crime family&lt;/a&gt;, as well as John McCullough, &lt;a href=\"Tradeunion\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt; boss of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Union%20of%20Roofers%2C%20Waterproofers%20and%20Allied%20Workers\"&gt;Roofers' Union, Local 30&lt;/a&gt;. It was through these influential connections that the K&amp;A Gang would expand into other rackets establishing its foothold in the &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Philadelphia\"&gt;Northeast&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1983, &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; garnered a reputation as the \"meth capital of the world\", according to a statement published by the &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, from a local police officer. It is widely held that this was made possible due to the K&amp;A Gang, and the &lt;a href=\"Junior%20Black%20Mafia\"&gt;Junior Black Mafia&lt;/a&gt;, among others.\nAfter being indicted for 14 counts of trafficking in methamphetamine and the chemical &lt;a href=\"Phenylacetone\"&gt;P2P&lt;/a&gt; in January 1982, Berkery fled to &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; to avoid prosecution, where he supposedly had contacts in the &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20IRA\"&gt;Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt;. After spending five years on the run, he was captured in June 1987 and subsequently faced trial in the fall of 1987. Berkery admitted to engaging in a large scale meth deal with &lt;a href=\"Chelsais%20Bouras\"&gt;Chelsais Bouras&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Greek%20Mob\"&gt;Philadelphia Greek Mob&lt;/a&gt;. Ronald Raiton, a notable criminal figure in the methamphetamine trade, testified that Berkery had bought 200 gallons of &lt;a href=\"Phenylacetone\"&gt;P2P&lt;/a&gt; from Raiton over the course of a year in 1980\u20131981. Prosecutors stated that Berkery, Frank \"The Beard\" Zappacosta, and &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20Martorano\"&gt;Raymond Martorano&lt;/a&gt; had planned to take over all meth trafficking in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;.\nString of drug ring arrests.\nCarl \"Better Days\" Jackson and Zappacosta assumed control of the group. Jackson and Zappacosta went on to lead the group until their &lt;a href=\"convictions\"&gt;convictions&lt;/a&gt; in late 1987, just a week after their former &lt;a href=\"crime%20boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; faced trial and was also found guilty. Jackson was said to have gained around 4 million dollars in drug profits in the period between his takeover of the gang's meth endeavours and his eventual arrest. He and Frank \"The Beard\" Zappacosta received a &lt;a href=\"Life%20imprisonment\"&gt;lifetime sentence&lt;/a&gt; in accordance with the &lt;a href=\"Continuing%20Criminal%20Enterprise\"&gt;Continuing Criminal Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; statute, otherwise known as the \"drug kingpin\" law.\nAlong with Carl Jackson and Frank \"The Beard\" Zappacosta, 22 affiliates of the K&amp;A meth ring were indicted under federal drug manufacturing charges related to an operation that authorities believe produced roughly ten million dollars worth of &lt;a href=\"methamphetamine\"&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt; in hidden labs across the &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; area. They were said to have manufactured 100 pounds of methamphetamine at a time, which was then distributed by Jackson's subordinates. At the time, US Attorney Edward Dennis claimed in a press release that the gang was \"one of the largest methamphetamine organizations in the nation\". Edward Loney was to arrange the procurement of 50 gallons of P2P, a precursor chemical, along with Waldemar \"Walter\" Roeder from Toronto, while Jackson sold mass quantities to contacts in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the downfall of Carl Jackson, Roy Stocker, Frank \"The Beard\" Zappacosta became the dominant K&amp;A member operating a methamphetamine manufacturing enterprise. In 1981, Stacker sought a partnership with &lt;a href=\"Nicodemo%20Scarfo\"&gt;Scarfo&lt;/a&gt; in an methamphetamine operation in &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Philadelphia\"&gt;Northeast Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, through Albert \"Reds\" Pontani. Between 1981 and 1986, he allegedly produced and distributed methamphetamine, commonly known as speed, and also allegedly took part in &lt;a href=\"extortion\"&gt;extortion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"loan-sharking\"&gt;loan-sharking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"burglary\"&gt;burglary&lt;/a&gt;. The meth rings were sanctioned by the &lt;a href=\"Scarfo%20crime%20family\"&gt;Scarfo crime family&lt;/a&gt;, who received a cut of the profits. In February 1991, Roy Stocker and three others were found guilty of operating a ring that sold $52 million worth of methamphetamine between 1981 and 1987.\nRoofers' Union corruption.\nIn the early 2000s, the Traitz brothers, who were connected to the K&amp;A Gang through the &lt;a href=\"United%20Union%20of%20Roofers%2C%20Waterproofers%20and%20Allied%20Workers\"&gt;Roofers' Union - Local 30&lt;/a&gt; were indicted for the murder of Robert Hammond. He was allegedly assumed to be an &lt;a href=\"informant\"&gt;informant&lt;/a&gt; on the meth operation that the Traitz brother ran in tandem with members of the K&amp;A gang. David Criniti who was involved in the operation soon testified against the defendants, dealing a blow to the K&amp;A Gang.\nHistorical membership.\nLeaders.\nBurglary ring-era captains.\nThe K&amp;A burglary crew was a coalition of \"crew chiefs\" and the organization was a horizontal one in terms of structure.\nPost '80s leaders.\nAround 1980, the groups switched to methamphetamine and with it came the need for a more hierarchical organization.\nJohn \"John L\" McManus - Former K&amp;A Burglar of repute.
