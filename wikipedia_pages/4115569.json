    "text": "Riverton is a &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australian%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20districts%20of%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;electorate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"states%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Riverton is named for the southern &lt;a href=\"Perth\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; suburb of &lt;a href=\"Riverton%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Riverton&lt;/a&gt; which falls within its borders.\nHistory.\nRiverton was created at the 1988 redistribution, replacing the abolished district of &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20district%20of%20Clontarf\"&gt;Clontarf&lt;/a&gt;, which had been a safe &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia%20%28Western%20Australian%20Division%29\"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; seat since a redistribution prior to the &lt;a href=\"1977%20Western%20Australian%20state%20election\"&gt;1977 election&lt;/a&gt;. Riverton was first contested at the &lt;a href=\"1989%20Western%20Australian%20state%20election\"&gt;1989 election&lt;/a&gt;, at which Liberal Party member &lt;a href=\"Graham%20Kierath\"&gt;Graham Kierath&lt;/a&gt; was successful. He served as a minister in the &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Court\"&gt;Court&lt;/a&gt; government, and held the seat until his unexpected defeat at the &lt;a href=\"2001%20Western%20Australian%20state%20election\"&gt;2001 election&lt;/a&gt; on a 10.16% swing. The seat was then held by &lt;a href=\"Tony%20McRae%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Tony McRae&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28Western%20Australian%20Branch%29\"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, until his defeat by the Liberal Party's &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Nahan\"&gt;Mike Nahan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Western%20Australian%20state%20election\"&gt;2008 election&lt;/a&gt;. McRae was the Minister for Environment, Climate Change and Disability Services between 2006 and 2008. Mike Nahan retired at the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Western%20Australian%20state%20election\"&gt;2021 election&lt;/a&gt;, and the seat was won back by the Labor party with a 13.3% swing towards them.\nGeography.\nRiverton is bounded by the &lt;a href=\"Canning%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29\"&gt;Canning River&lt;/a&gt; to the north, Bannister Creek and &lt;a href=\"High%20Road%2C%20Perth\"&gt;High Road&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast, &lt;a href=\"Nicholson%20Road\"&gt;Nicholson Road&lt;/a&gt; to the east, the freight railway and &lt;a href=\"South%20Street%2C%20Perth\"&gt;South Street&lt;/a&gt; to the south, and Karel Avenue and Fifth Avenue to the west. Its boundaries include the suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Parkwood%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Parkwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riverton%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Riverton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shelley%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Shelley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Willetton%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Willetton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Creek%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Bull Creek&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Canning%20Vale%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Canning Vale&lt;/a&gt; industrial area and markets.\nThe 2007 redistribution, which took effect at the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Western%20Australian%20state%20election\"&gt;2008 election&lt;/a&gt;, resulted in the seat losing &lt;a href=\"Ferndale%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Ferndale&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast and eastern &lt;a href=\"Leeming%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Leeming&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest, while gaining the unpopulated &lt;a href=\"Canning%20Vale%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Canning Vale&lt;/a&gt; industrial area."
