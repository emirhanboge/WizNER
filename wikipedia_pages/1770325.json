    "text": "Dr. Evermor's Forevertron is the largest &lt;a href=\"scrap%20metal\"&gt;scrap metal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sculpture\"&gt;sculpture&lt;/a&gt; in the world, standing 50 ft. (15,2 m.) high and 120 ft. (36,5 m.) wide, and weighing 300 tons. Built in the 1980s, it is housed in Dr. Evermor's Art Park on &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Highway 12&lt;/a&gt;, in the town of &lt;a href=\"North%20Freedom%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Sumpter&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Sauk%20County%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Sauk County, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sculpture incorporates two &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Edison\"&gt;Thomas Edison&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dynamo\"&gt;dynamo&lt;/a&gt;s from the 1880s, lightning rods, high-voltage components from 1920s power plants, scrap from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Badger%20Army%20Ammunition%20Plant\"&gt;Badger Army Ammunition Plant&lt;/a&gt;, and the decontamination chamber from the &lt;a href=\"Apollo%2011\"&gt;Apollo 11&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft. Its creator, Tom Every (1938 - 2020), was born in &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20%28village%29%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Brooklyn, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; and was a demolition expert who spent decades collecting antique machinery for the sculpture and the surrounding fiction that justifies it. According to Every, Dr. Evermor was a &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; inventor who designed the Forevertron to launch himself, \"into the heavens on a magnetic lightning force beam.\" The Forevertron, despite its size and weight, was designed to be relocatable to a different site\u2014the sculpture is built in sections that are connected by bolts and pins.\nIn addition to the Forevertron itself, the sculpture includes a &lt;a href=\"tea%20house\"&gt;tea house&lt;/a&gt; gazebo from which Every says: \"&lt;a href=\"Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Albert%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha\"&gt;Prince Albert&lt;/a&gt; may observe the launching of Dr. Evermor; it also includes a giant telescope where skeptics may observe the ascent.\" Dr. Evermor's art park is home to a large number of other sculptures, many of which relate to the Forevertron, such as the \"Celestial Listening Ear\" and the \"Overlord Master Control Tower\". Other large-scale sculptures include gigantic insects (the \"Juicer Bug\" and \"Arachna Artie\"), the \"Epicurean\" bellows-driven barbecue train, \"The Dragon\", and \"The UFO\". The most numerous sculptures are the \"Bird Band and Orchestra\" which includes nearly 70 birds ranging from the size of a child to twenty feet tall, all made from scrap industrial parts, geological survey markers, knives, loudspeakers, springs, and musical instruments, among other salvaged materials.\nEvery related that he took pride in allowing the original materials to remain unaltered as much as possible, using their original forms in new juxtapositions to create his aesthetic. \u00a0Although Every has now passed, tours of the art park site can generally be accessed from passing through the surplus store adjacent to it, Delaney's Surplus. Every also created much of the installation art for the &lt;a href=\"House%20on%20the%20Rock\"&gt;House on the Rock&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"House%20on%20the%20Rock%20Carousel\"&gt;world's largest carousel&lt;/a&gt;."
