    "text": "Jetcar is a brand of small car manufactured by \"Jetcar Zukunftsfahrzeug GmbH\" in &lt;a href=\"Neuruppin\"&gt;Neuruppin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The company was established in 2000. The car has two seats, with the passenger sitting behind the driver. It is built using &lt;a href=\"carbon%20fibre\"&gt;carbon fibre&lt;/a&gt; and costs between 48,000 and 58,000 &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; including taxes in Germany The manufacturer has limited production of the vehicle to 100 cars. The car consumed 2.8l of diesel per 100 kilometers (82miles per US gallon) during an official &lt;a href=\"Technischer%20%C3%9Cberwachungsverein\"&gt;T\u00dcV&lt;/a&gt; test. Top speed for the car is 160\u00a0km/h (100mp/hr). The drivers seat looks similar to a cockpit, which may be the reason for car's name. The engine is the diesel engine from a &lt;a href=\"Smart%20%28car%29\"&gt;Smart (car)&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to its length of over 4 metres, it does not qualify as a &lt;a href=\"Kei%20car\"&gt;Kei car&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe company's web site mentions the similarity of the seating arrangement to that of the &lt;a href=\"Messerschmitt%20KR200\"&gt;Messerschmitt Kabinenroller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FMR%20Tg500\"&gt;FMR Tg500&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Fritz Fend\u2013designed cars, it is a highway &lt;a href=\"microcar\"&gt;microcar&lt;/a&gt; (or perhaps one should call the Jetcar a minicar) and therefore needs to have very low air drag. The manufacturer claims also to have used aircraft technology. The Jetcar is about twice as heavy, so the use of modern materials must have been more than compensated by much more demanding requirements in other areas.\nSize of the car:"
