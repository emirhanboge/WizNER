    "text": "Sudbury Wanderers was an &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Sudbury%2C%20Suffolk\"&gt;Sudbury, Suffolk&lt;/a&gt;. Established in 1958, the club merged with &lt;a href=\"Sudbury%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Sudbury Town&lt;/a&gt; in 1999 to form &lt;a href=\"A.F.C.%20Sudbury\"&gt;AFC Sudbury&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe club was established in June 1958 following a meeting in the town's Black Horse pub. The founders were former members of Sudbury Youth Club who had been playing in the Halstead &amp; District League, but had been told that they were too old to still be members. The club also joined the Halstead &amp; District League and played in yellow and blue after their first kit was donated by Sudbury Town. They won the league and league cup double during the first season and were promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Essex%20and%20Suffolk%20Border%20Football%20League\"&gt;Essex &amp; Suffolk Border League&lt;/a&gt;. In 1966\u201367 they were Division One champions, but were denied promotion due to a lack of facilities at their home ground.\nThey were finally promoted to the Premier Division in 1977 after moving to a new ground in 1976 and then winning the Division One title. In 1989\u201390 they won the Premier Division for the first time. The following season they won the &lt;a href=\"Suffolk%20Senior%20Cup\"&gt;Suffolk Senior Cup&lt;/a&gt; and retained the title, earning promotion to Division One of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Counties%20Football%20League\"&gt;Eastern Counties League&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir second season in the ECL saw the club win Division One, setting records for the longest unbeaten run at the start of a season (17 matches), most consecutive victories (13) and biggest away win (11\u20130 at &lt;a href=\"Swaffham%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swaffham Town&lt;/a&gt;). In 1997\u201398 they met neighbours Sudbury Town in the league for the first time after they dropped out of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt;, and also won the &lt;a href=\"Suffolk%20Premier%20Cup\"&gt;Suffolk Premier Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The following season they won the league cup with a record 7\u20132 win over &lt;a href=\"Felixstowe%20%26amp%3B%20Walton%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Felixstowe Port &amp; Town&lt;/a&gt;. On 1 June 1999 the club merged with &lt;a href=\"Sudbury%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Sudbury Town&lt;/a&gt; to form &lt;a href=\"A.F.C.%20Sudbury\"&gt;AFC Sudbury&lt;/a&gt;. The new club plays at Wanderers' old ground.\nGround.\nThe club initially played on People's Park, before moving to the Kings Marsh ground on Brundon Lane in 1976. Their record attendance was 892 for an &lt;a href=\"FA%20Vase\"&gt;FA Vase&lt;/a&gt; sixth round match on 28 February 1998."
