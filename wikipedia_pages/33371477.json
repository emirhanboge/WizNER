    "text": "The Afghan\u2013Sikh wars were a series of battles between the &lt;a href=\"Durrani%20Empire\"&gt;Durrani Empire&lt;/a&gt; (centered in present-day &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"Sikh%20Empire\"&gt;Sikh Empire&lt;/a&gt; (located in the &lt;a href=\"Punjab\"&gt;Punjab&lt;/a&gt; region). The conflict had its origins stemming from the days of the &lt;a href=\"Dal%20Khalsa%20%28Sikh%20Empire%29\"&gt;Dal Khalsa&lt;/a&gt;. This conflict continued after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Durrani%20Empire\"&gt;Durrani Empire&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Emirate%20of%20Afghanistan\"&gt;Emirate of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, prominently under &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Mohammad%20Khan\"&gt;Sultan Mohammad Khan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dost%20Mohammad%20Khan\"&gt;Dost Mohammad Khan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wazir%20Akbar%20Khan\"&gt;Wazir Akbar Khan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sikh%20Confederacy\"&gt;Sikh Confederacy&lt;/a&gt; had effectively achieved independence from the &lt;a href=\"Mughal%20Empire\"&gt;Mughal Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 1716, and expanded at its expense in the following decades, despite the &lt;a href=\"Chhota%20Ghallughara\"&gt;Chhota Ghallughara&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Afsharid%20dynasty\"&gt;Afsharid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Persians\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; emperor &lt;a href=\"Nader%20Shah%27s%20invasion%20of%20the%20Mughal%20Empire\"&gt;Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire&lt;/a&gt; (1738\u201340) dealt a heavy blow to the Mughals, but after &lt;a href=\"Nader%20Shah\"&gt;Nader Shah&lt;/a&gt;'s death in 1747, the &lt;a href=\"Durrani%20Empire\"&gt;Durrani Empire&lt;/a&gt; (roughly covering modern Afghanistan and &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;) declared its independence from &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Persia&lt;/a&gt;. Four years later, this new Afghan state came into conflict with the Sikh alliance.\nFirst phase.\nOn 12 January 1748, &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Shah%20Durrani\"&gt;Ahmad Shah Durrani&lt;/a&gt; invaded and occupied &lt;a href=\"Lahore\"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt;, after the Mughal governor of Lahore, Shah Nawaz Khan, fled to Delhi. Establishing a governor over Lahore, Ahmad marched his army east taking more territory, but was defeated at the Battle of Manupur by Mughals in alliance with Sikhs and fled back to Kandahar. Sikh bands under &lt;a href=\"Charat%20Singh\"&gt;Charat Singh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jassa%20Singh%20Ahluwalia\"&gt;Jassa Singh Ahluwalia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ala%20Singh\"&gt;Ala Singh&lt;/a&gt; continued to harass Durrani forces by depriving them of their booty as they retreated. Thus, the first invasion of Shah proved a failure but it gave an opportunity to the Sikhs to organize themselves into &lt;a href=\"Dal%20Khalsa%20%28Sikh%20Army%29\"&gt;Dal Khalsa&lt;/a&gt;, an army of Sikh Confederacy, at &lt;a href=\"Amritsar\"&gt;Amritsar&lt;/a&gt; in March 1748. The Sikhs retook Lahore only to lose it to the Afghans by 12 April 1752.\nThe Sikhs would commence in guerilla warfare to try to kick the Afghans out of Punjab. In November 1757, the Sikhs defeated the outnumbered Afghan army at Battle of Amritsar (also known as the Battle of Gohalwar), under the command of Timur Shah Durrani, son of Ahmad Shah Durrani. Faced with the imminent fall of Lahore, the Durrani commander-in-chief Jahan Khan and Timur Shah hastily evacuated the city, but to ford the Chenab and Ravi rivers, most of the army's baggage was abandoned and thousands drowned attempting to cross the river. Those Afghans who were taken prisoners by the Sikhs, were put to work in cleaning the sacred tank in Amritsar which was previously desecrated by the Afghans. The Sikhs ousted its Afghan &lt;a href=\"faujdar\"&gt;faujdar&lt;/a&gt; (military officer) Sa\u2018adat Khan Afridi from Jalandhar early in 1758. Henceforth, in whichever direction an Afghan army was sent, it came back defeated. The Sikhs even attacked and captured Lahore and plundered its suburbs. However, the Afghans returned in 1761, recapturing Lahore but this victory was short-lived. In May 1761, a Sikh army annihilated a force let by Ahmad Shah's governor of the Chahar Mahal, and a relief party despatched from Kandahar was defeated and forced to surrender. The Sikhs then took Lahore while its governor barricaded himself in the citadel. In September 1761, the governor Ahmad Shah Durrani had appointed to the province of Lahore was defeated by the Sikhs near Gujranwala. The Sikhs threw out the other appointees of Ahmad Shah and brought the entire land from the Satluj to the Indus, under their control. Afghan faujdars were dislodged by the Sikhs from the Bist Jalandhar Doab, Sarhind, Rachna and the Chaj Doabs. Ahmad Shah lost most of the Punjab to Sikhs.\nIn October 1762, Ahmad Shah Durrani attacked Amritsar but was defeated by the Sikhs. In November 1763, Sikh forces had forced Durrani armies to advance upon them, which led to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sialkot%20%281763%29\"&gt;Battle of Sialkot&lt;/a&gt;, where the Afghans were defeated, and were forced to leave their Punjab campaign in the wake of this defeat. Jahan Khan suffered a heavy defeat at Gujranwala and the Sikhs followed their victory by sacking Malerkotla and Morinda. The Sikhs next defeated the commander of Rohtas Fortress, Sarbaland Khan Saddozai, imprisoned him but later released after he accepted Sikh suzeranity. When Ahmad Shah heard of the disasters, he flew into paroxym of rage and wrote to Nasir Khan, beglar begi of Khalat, to join him in jihad (holy war) against the Sikhs, to destroy them and to enslave their women and children. However, in 1764 on Ahmad Shah's return to Punjab, the jihad came to nothing. The advance guard was ambushed and routed by the Sikhs outside of Lahore. When Ahmad Shah came to Punjab in 1765 his authority was confined to his camp; he was on the defensive and he returned to Kabul without fighting a single battle even though the Sikhs were hovering around his camp. Qazi Nur Muhammad, who had accompanied the Shah on this expedition, regretfully observed that the Sikhs had divided up the country from Sarhind to the Derajat among themselves and enjoyed it \u2018without fear from anyone\u2019. The Sikhs formally declared their sovereignty by striking a coin at Lahore after its occupation by three of their leaders. This coin bore the inscription which Banda Bahadur had used on his seal fifty-five years earlier. 13 Sikh rule was re-established and it had come to stay.\nThe Sikhs would also capture &lt;a href=\"Multan\"&gt;Multan&lt;/a&gt; in 1772. The period after this would be known as the \"Sikh Interlude Period\", from 1772 to 1780.\nSecond Phase (Campaigns of Timur Shah).\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Ahmad%20Shah%20Durrani\"&gt;Ahmad Shah Durrani&lt;/a&gt;, the Sikhs capitalized on the weakened &lt;a href=\"Durrani%20Empire\"&gt;Durrani Empire&lt;/a&gt; and seized &lt;a href=\"Multan\"&gt;Multan&lt;/a&gt;. Timur Shah, knowing this did not take action due to internal issues from dealing with Shah Wali Khan and Prince Humayun and further pressing domestic issues, and planned to strike at another opportune moment against the Sikhs. When he left &lt;a href=\"Kabul\"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt; to his winter capital of &lt;a href=\"Peshawar\"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt; to reside in the &lt;a href=\"Bala%20Hissar%2C%20Peshawar\"&gt;Bala Hissar, Peshawar&lt;/a&gt;, he was given notice that 60,000 Sikhs had joined forces and marched across the &lt;a href=\"Chenab%20River\"&gt;Chenab River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ravi%20River\"&gt;Ravi River&lt;/a&gt;, who were moving on their way to occupy Dirah. In accordance to Sharia rule, and Durrani culture, Timur Shah sent an ambassador to the Sikhs, Sardar Hajji 'Ali Khan, giving them kind words and attempting to make peace. The Sikhs however, had shown arrogance, believing in their numbers, they had Timur's envoy tied to a tree and used him as target practice. They are also quoted to have said: \"His Highness Timur Shah is trying to scare us but the fact of the matter is that he is afraid of us\". Those companions who had traveled with 'Ali Khan that managed to escape broke the news to Timur Shah. Timur Shah, now angered had donned red clothing, as a sign of bloodlust and ordered the generals of the Durrani army to present themselves and their armies in battle gear, verifying them as prepared for a campaign. The Shah chose 18,000 men consisting of Afghan, Mongol, and &lt;a href=\"Qizilbash\"&gt;Qizilbash&lt;/a&gt; horsemen under the command of Zangi-Khan, and declared &lt;a href=\"Jihad\"&gt;Jihad&lt;/a&gt; against the Sikhs. Timur Shah would also counsel with his generals, to allow no abuse to disdain the rewards of &lt;a href=\"Jihad\"&gt;Jihad&lt;/a&gt;. Zangi Khan and Timur Shah marched beyond the Nilab river until the two armies had met, with Timur Shah and his army being around eight kuruhs from the Sikh armies. The guards were spread point two kuruks apart to prevent travelers heading in the direction of the Sikhs, often detaining them as well. Timur Shah waited until the final third of the night and rested his men, he then aligned for battle, posting &lt;a href=\"Qizilbash\"&gt;Qizilbash&lt;/a&gt; and Mongols on his flanks, while Timur Shah was at the centre of the army with 5,000 &lt;a href=\"Yusufzai\"&gt;Yusufzai&lt;/a&gt; cavalry. and the rest of the Durrani armies from &lt;a href=\"Kandahar\"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;. Timur Shah and his army advanced advanced in this position, and no later then sunrise were they around point 2 Kuruhs from the Sikh army. Morning prayers were preformed and the Afghan armies attacked following this. The Sikh armies, unaware of the approach of Timur Shah's army would scramble to fight, preparing for battle. The Sikh armies were routed in this battle, and the Afghan armies had pursued them, harassing them so relentlessly that the death-toll was put at over 30,000. The Sikh cavalrymen had escaped the battle initially, but most had died in the pursuing chase by the Afghans or drowned by accidentally driving their horses into a nearby river. From this, only 2,000 Sikh Cavalrymen had escaped. A mere 4 days after the Shah's departure from &lt;a href=\"Peshawar\"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt;, he had returned with many celebrations put into place, Zangi-Khan was also given a robe of honor. Timur Shah had also marched on &lt;a href=\"Multan\"&gt;Multan&lt;/a&gt;, sieging the city. The Sikhs, knowing they did not have the proper resources to resist the Afghan incursion, sued for peace. With the Sikhs giving the Shah's official the keys to the citadel, and were in return given security for their lives and possessions. After consolidating &lt;a href=\"Multan\"&gt;Multan&lt;/a&gt;, Timur Shah gave the city over to Shuja Khan Sadozai, not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"Shah%20Shuja%20Durrani\"&gt;Shah Shuja Durrani&lt;/a&gt; and had returned to &lt;a href=\"Peshawar\"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt;. Timur Shah later left &lt;a href=\"Peshawar\"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt; to return to &lt;a href=\"Kabul\"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;, also holding celebration there of his victories.\nThis phase ended with the death of &lt;a href=\"Timur%20Shah%20Durrani\"&gt;Timur Shah&lt;/a&gt; on 20 May 1793, leading his successor, &lt;a href=\"Zaman%20Shah%20Durrani\"&gt;Zaman Shah Durrani&lt;/a&gt; to ascend to the &lt;a href=\"Durrani%20Empire\"&gt;Durrani&lt;/a&gt; throne.\nThird Phase (Campaigns of Zaman Shah).\n&lt;a href=\"Zaman%20Shah%20Durrani\"&gt;Zaman Shah Durrani&lt;/a&gt; ascended to the &lt;a href=\"Durrani%20Empire\"&gt;Durrani&lt;/a&gt; throne after his father, &lt;a href=\"Timur%20Shah%20Durrani\"&gt;Timur Shah&lt;/a&gt; died on 20 May 1793. Zaman Shah lead multiple campaigns of Punjab against the Sikhs. His first campaign was in November 1796.\nZaman Shah's campaign of Punjab in 1796 against the Sikhs, led to capture of &lt;a href=\"Lahore\"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt; in January 1797, without any opposition as the Sikh chiefs retired to Amritsar to protect the holy city. Zaman Shah progressed towards Amritsar on January 13, 1797, where he was defeated by the Sikhs, 10\u00a0km away from the city. As intelligence from Kabul had warned of a possible Persian invasion of main &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, Zaman Shah was forced to abandon his first Punjab campaign and return home to mobilize an army to combat this threat, headed by his own brother, &lt;a href=\"Mahmud%20Shah%20Durrani\"&gt;Mahmud Shah Durrani&lt;/a&gt;. The Sikhs recaptured &lt;a href=\"Lahore\"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt; as he left. After retreat, he left his deputy general, Ahmad Khan Shahanchi-bashi in charge, along with Afghan soldiers but he too was defeated and killed by the Sikhs.\nSecond campaign of Punjab.\nHaving dealt with &lt;a href=\"Mahmud%20Shah%20Durrani\"&gt;Mahmud Shah Durrani&lt;/a&gt; for the time being, Zaman Shah returned to &lt;a href=\"Punjab\"&gt;Punjab&lt;/a&gt; and resumed his campaign once again, occupying &lt;a href=\"Lahore\"&gt;Lahore&lt;/a&gt; in autumn of 1798, without opposition, as it was strategy of Ranjit Singh to drive them into Lahore and then lay siege to the city. Zaman Shah intended to march on Delhi but the Sikhs laid waste around 150\u00a0km of his camp to stop supplies and engaged in skirmishes. Facing determined foe who could cut of his communication with Kabul, Shah Zaman exercised discretion and returned to Afghanistan with his troops on 4 January 1799. Bhangi Sikh Misl recaptured Lahore. Zaman Shah then appointed 19 yr old &lt;a href=\"Ranjit%20Singh\"&gt;Ranjit Singh&lt;/a&gt; as governor of Lahore to try to divide the Sikhs and returned to Peshawar where Sikhs all along harried the Afghans to river Jhelum. While crossing the river, Zaman Shah lost most men, supplies and heavy artillery due to upsurge. Eventually, Shah Zaman and his remaining army reached &lt;a href=\"Kandahar\"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt; in late 1799, exhausted from the campaign.\nThird campaign of Punjab.\nZaman Shah set out his third campaign of &lt;a href=\"Punjab\"&gt;Punjab&lt;/a&gt; in the spring of 1800, plotted to deal with a rebellious &lt;a href=\"Ranjit%20Singh\"&gt;Ranjit Singh&lt;/a&gt;. However, having civil strife in Afghanistan, he was forced to cut his campaign short, having to deal with his brother, &lt;a href=\"Mahmud%20Shah%20Durrani\"&gt;Mahmud Shah Durrani&lt;/a&gt; once again. Shah Zaman would not return to Punjab, and he would be deposed by Mahmud Shah.\nFourth Phase.\nIn 1813, after demanding the return of the fort at Attock, the Durrani prime minister Wazir Fateh Khan besieged Attock. A Punjabi relief force arrived and for three months the two armies faced each other, neither side moving. As the heat from summer started to affect the armies, &lt;a href=\"Dewan%20Mokham%20Chand\"&gt;Dewan Mokham Chand&lt;/a&gt; marched his army to block the Afghans from getting water from the river. Without water the Afghan troops began to suffer dehydration, so they launched attack after attack towards the river, but were unable to break through. Chand, realizing the Afghans were weakened, charged his cavalry at the Afghans who broke and ran, losing two thousand men.\nAccusing Ranjit Singh of treachery, Fateh Khan set off from Kashmir at the head of 15,000 &lt;a href=\"cavalry\"&gt;cavalry&lt;/a&gt; in April 1813 and &lt;a href=\"Investment%20%28military%29\"&gt;invested&lt;/a&gt; Attock Fort. At the same time Ranjit Singh rushed Dewan Mokham Chand and Karam Chand Chahal from &lt;a href=\"Burhan%2C%20Pakistan\"&gt;Burhan&lt;/a&gt; with a force of cavalry, artillery, and a &lt;a href=\"battalion\"&gt;battalion&lt;/a&gt; of infantry to meet the Afghans.\n&lt;a href=\"Dewan%20Mokham%20Chand\"&gt;Dewan Mokham Chand&lt;/a&gt; Nayyar encamped from the Afghan camp, unwilling to risk a decisive engagement, although both sides engaged in numerous skirmishes and took losses. On 12 July 1813, the Afghans' supplies were exhausted and Dewan Mokham Chand Nayyar marched from Attock to Haidaru, on the banks of the Indus River, to offer battle. On 13 July 1813, Dewan Mokham Chand Nayyar split the cavalry into four divisions, giving command of one division to Hari Singh Nalwa and taking command of one division himself. The lone battalion of infantry formed an &lt;a href=\"infantry%20square\"&gt;infantry square&lt;/a&gt; protecting the artillery, with Gouse Khan commanding the artillery. The Afghans took up positions opposite the Sikhs, with a portion of their cavalry under the command of &lt;a href=\"Dost%20Mohammad%20Khan\"&gt;Dost Mohammad Khan&lt;/a&gt;.\nFateh Khan opened the battle by sending his &lt;a href=\"Pathans\"&gt;Pathans&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"cavalry%20charge\"&gt;cavalry charge&lt;/a&gt; which was repulsed by heavy fire from the Sikh artillery. The Afghans rallied under Dost Mohammad Khan, who led the Ghazis on another cavalry charge which threw one wing of the Sikh army into disarray and captured some artillery. When it appeared the Sikhs had lost the battle, Dewan Mokham Chand led a cavalry charge atop a &lt;a href=\"war%20elephant\"&gt;war elephant&lt;/a&gt; that repulsed the Afghans \"at all points\", and &lt;a href=\"rout\"&gt;rout&lt;/a&gt;ed the remaining Afghan troops. Fateh Khan, fearing his brother, Dost Mohammad Khan, had died, escaped to Kabul and the Sikhs captured the Afghan camp, including the lost artillery pieces.\nTwo months after the victory at Attock, Ranjit Singh launched a campaign to take &lt;a href=\"Kashmir\"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; from the Durrani Empire. A late Autumn start postponed the campaign until the next spring. By June, an army of 30,000 men under the command of Ram Dyal, grandson of &lt;a href=\"Dewan%20Mokham%20Chand\"&gt;Dewan Mokham Chand&lt;/a&gt;, marched toward Baramulla, with a pincer attack of 20,000 men led by Ranjit Singh marching to Poonch.\nRanjit's force was delayed by torrential rains, while Ram Dyal's army took the fortress of Baramulla on 20 July 1814. When Dyal's army reached Shupaiyan, the governor of Kashmir, Azim Khan blocked his advance. Fighting a delaying action, Dyal waited on a reinforcement of 5,000 men from Ranjit. These reinforcements were forced to a standstill by Afghan snipers.\nRanjit Singh's force made little progress. Faced with a scorched earth from the fleeing populace, food supplies became a major issue for his army, followed by a cholera outbreak. Meanwhile, Ram Dyal, who was entrenched near &lt;a href=\"Srinagar\"&gt;Srinagar&lt;/a&gt;, received a proposal from Azim Khan for a negotiated peace and was able to extricate himself from a difficult situation. Ranjit Singh's campaign ended in failure.\n&lt;a href=\"Amritsar\"&gt;Amritsar&lt;/a&gt;, Lahore, and other large cities across the Sikh Empire were illuminated for two months afterwards in rejoicing over the victory. After his defeat at Attock, Fateh Khan fought off an attempt by &lt;a href=\"Fat%E2%80%B2h-Ali%20Shah%20Qajar\"&gt;Ali Shah&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler of &lt;a href=\"Persia\"&gt;Persia&lt;/a&gt;, and his son &lt;a href=\"Dowlatshah\"&gt;Ali Mirza&lt;/a&gt; to capture the &lt;a href=\"Durrani%20Empire\"&gt;Durrani&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href=\"Herat\"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt;, which left their newly captured province of Kashmir open to attack.\nSiege of Multan.\nIn early January the Sikh force began their campaign with the capture of &lt;a href=\"Nawab%20Muzaffar%20Khan\"&gt;Nawab Muzaffar Khan&lt;/a&gt;'s forts at &lt;a href=\"Muzaffargarh\"&gt;Muzaffargarh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khangarh\"&gt;Khangarh&lt;/a&gt;. In February, the Sikh force under &lt;a href=\"Kharak%20Singh\"&gt;Kharak Singh&lt;/a&gt; reached Multan and ordered Muzaffar to pay the large &lt;a href=\"tribute\"&gt;tribute&lt;/a&gt; he owed and to surrender the fort, but Muzaffar refused. The Sikh forces won an engagement near the city but were unable to capture Muzaffar before he retreated into the fort. The Sikh army asked for more artillery and Ranjit Singh sent them the &lt;a href=\"Zamzama\"&gt;Zamzama&lt;/a&gt; and other large artillery pieces, which commenced fire on the walls of the fort. In early June, Sadhu Singh and a small band of other &lt;a href=\"Nihang\"&gt;Akalis&lt;/a&gt; attacked the fort walls and discovered a breach in the wall. As they ran in to battle the unaware garrison the larger Sikh army was alerted and entered the fort through the breach. Muzaffar and his sons attempted a &lt;a href=\"sortie\"&gt;sortie&lt;/a&gt; to defend the fort but were killed in the battle.\nThe siege of Multan ended significant &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghan&lt;/a&gt; influence in the &lt;a href=\"Peshawar\"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt; region and led to multiple Sikh attempts at capturing and the final capture of Peshawar.\nBattle of Shopian.\nThe battle took place in the &lt;a href=\"Shopian%20district\"&gt;Shopian&lt;/a&gt; region in the &lt;a href=\"Kashmir\"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; region. This battle included the 1819 Kashmir expedition, which led to Kashmir being annexed to the &lt;a href=\"Sikh%20Empire\"&gt;Sikh Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Sikh army entered the city of &lt;a href=\"Srinagar\"&gt;Srinagar&lt;/a&gt; after the battle, Prince Kharak Singh guaranteed the personal safety of every citizen and ensured the city was not plundered. The peaceful capture of Srinagar was important as Srinagar, besides having a large &lt;a href=\"Shawl\"&gt;Shawl&lt;/a&gt;-making industry, was also the center of trade between &lt;a href=\"Punjab%20region\"&gt;Panjab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tibet\"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skardu\"&gt;Iskardo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ladakh\"&gt;Ladakh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter taking Srinagar, the Sikh army faced no major opposition in conquering &lt;a href=\"Kashmir\"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;. However, when Ranjit Singh installed Moti Ram, the son of Dewan Mokham Chand, as the new governor of Kashmir, he also sent a \"large body of troops\" with him to ensure tribute from strongholds within Kashmir that might attempt to resist Sikh rule. The capture of Kashmir set the boundaries and borders of the Sikh Empire with &lt;a href=\"Tibet\"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;. The conquest of Kashmir marked an \"extensive addition\" to the Sikh Empire and \"significantly\" increased the empire's revenue and landmass.\nFifth Phase.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Peshawar%20%281834%29\"&gt;Battle of Peshawar&lt;/a&gt; took place on 6 May 1834. The Sikhs took advantage of Dost Mohammad's precarious state and occupied Peshawar. Sultan Muhammad Khan was deposed and a Sikh governor, Hari Singh was installed.\nBattle of Jamrud.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Jamrud\"&gt;Battle of Jamrud&lt;/a&gt; was the fifth and foremost battle within the third Afghan\u2013Sikh war. The result of the battle is disputed amongst historians. Some contend the failure of the Afghans to take the fort and the city of &lt;a href=\"Peshawar\"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt; or town of &lt;a href=\"Jamrud\"&gt;Jamrud&lt;/a&gt; as a victory for the Sikhs. On the other hand, some state that the killing of &lt;a href=\"Hari%20Singh%20Nalwa\"&gt;Hari Singh Nalwa&lt;/a&gt; resulted in an Afghan victory. James Norris, Professor of Political Science at Texas A&amp;M International University, states that the battle's outcome was inconclusive."
