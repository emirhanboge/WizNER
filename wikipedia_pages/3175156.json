    "text": "Grug is an &lt;a href=\"Australian\"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; fictional character appearing in a series of children's books by the author &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Prior%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Ted Prior&lt;/a&gt;. They were published between 1979 and 1992 by &lt;a href=\"Hodder%20%26amp%3B%20Stoughton%2C%20Australia\"&gt;Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Australia&lt;/a&gt; and have now been republished by Simon &amp; Schuster, Australia from the 1st of June, 2009. Three new books have also been published since 1992. \nGrug began his life as the top of a Burrawang tree (&lt;a href=\"Macrozamia%20communis\"&gt;Macrozamia communis&lt;/a&gt;) that looks more like a Grass tree (&lt;a href=\"Xanthorrhoea\"&gt;Xanthorrhoea&lt;/a&gt;). Resembling a small, striped haystack with a face, he is fascinated by the world around him and solves everyday problems creatively and without fuss. When dancing instructions are too difficult to understand, Grug invents his own dance and calls it \"The Grug\".\nTheatre productions.\nGrug has spawned two plays, \"Grug\" which \"centers on the fun of visual surprise.\" and \"Grug and the Rainbow\" based on several of the books and \"amongst the best children's theatre you will find\"."
