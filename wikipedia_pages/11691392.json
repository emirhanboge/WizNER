    "text": "Win's Movie and Television Production (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd. () originally known as Win's Movie Production &amp; I/E Co. Ltd. and Win's Entertainment (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd., was a &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; film &lt;a href=\"production%20company\"&gt;production company&lt;/a&gt; that was formed by producer &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Heung\"&gt;Charles Heung&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Heung\"&gt;Jimmy Heung&lt;/a&gt;. Following its establishment in 1977, Win's Entertainment went on to become one of the powerful film producers in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. The company helped to establish the careers of actors &lt;a href=\"Jet%20Li\"&gt;Jet Li&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chow%20Yun-fat\"&gt;Chow Yun-fat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Lau\"&gt;Andy Lau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Chow\"&gt;Stephen Chow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lau%20Ching-Wan\"&gt;Lau Ching-Wan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWin's Movie Production (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd. was formed in 1977 by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Heung\"&gt;Charles Heung&lt;/a&gt; and his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Heung\"&gt;Jimmy Heung&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"Triad%20society\"&gt;triad&lt;/a&gt;'s influence on the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; film industry was growing notorious during the 1980s, Charles decided to form his own production company that would provide a safe refuge. He was quoted for saying that \"every film is a battle,\" when asked why he named the company Win's. Following its formation, the company went on to become one of Hong Kong's most successful film studios alongside &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Sky%20Golden%20Harvest\"&gt;Golden Harvest&lt;/a&gt;. Virtually every actor and actress, apart from &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Chan\"&gt;Jackie Chan&lt;/a&gt;, had made a film for the Heungs.\nCompany history.\nWin's Entertainment's filmography spans over 10 years, and some of the films it has produced include the \"&lt;a href=\"God%20of%20Gamblers\"&gt;God of Gamblers&lt;/a&gt;\" franchise \"&lt;a href=\"Tricky%20Brains\"&gt;Tricky Brains&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Lee%20Rock\"&gt;Lee Rock&lt;/a&gt;\" trilogy and the \"&lt;a href=\"Fight%20Back%20to%20School\"&gt;Fight Back to School&lt;/a&gt;\" trilogy. A majority of its films featured some of Hong Kong's most well-known actors including &lt;a href=\"Jet%20Li\"&gt;Jet Li&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chow%20Yun-fat\"&gt;Chow Yun-fat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Lau\"&gt;Andy Lau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Chow\"&gt;Stephen Chow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ng%20Man%20Tat\"&gt;Ng Man Tat&lt;/a&gt;.\n1980s saw the surging demand of home entertainment in Hong Kong, thanks to the introduction of videotapes / laser discs, their respective VCR / LD players, as well as the growing popularity of Karaoke. Winson (\u6f64\u7a0b) was one of the first companies tapping into this golden opportunity in the laser disc business.\nWith the collaboration of Wong Kam Fu of Star Paging Group fame, Winson Entertainment secured the very first laser disc deal of Golden Harvest films (with a joint venture with UK's Virgin Vision) in 1987, subsequently renamed into Star Entertainment (\u661f\u5149\u5a1b\u6a02), later becoming a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-listed Star Entertainment International Holding in 1992.\nIn 1992 the Heung brothers ended their partnership and Charles renamed Win's Movie Production (Hong Kong) Co Ltd into Win's Entertainment (Hong Kong) Co Ltd.\nStar Entertainment was eventually sold to China Star Group in 1996, while the founder of Winson (Sonny Chan) moved on to resurrect its label, engaging in distribution of VCD/DVD of old Cantonese films/opera as well as making a couple of modern films up to present time.\nIn 1999, Charles closed down the Win's Entertainment studio, and founded another studio called \"One Hundred Years of Film\". Charles continued to produce and present films under China Star.\nIn 2009, the company has been returned and renamed as \"Win's Movie and Television Production\", replacing &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred%20Years%20of%20Film\"&gt;One Hundred Years of Film&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn't last long and it was short-lived. The company went defunct in 2010.\nSubsidiaries.\nSubsidiaries of Win's Entertainment (Hong Kong) Co Ltd include production companies such as &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred%20Years%20of%20Film\"&gt;One Hundred Years of Film&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"China%20Star%20Entertainment%20Group\"&gt;China Star Entertainment Group&lt;/a&gt;, and Winson Entertainment/Star Entertainment."
