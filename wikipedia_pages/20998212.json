    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; is the southernmost mainland &lt;a href=\"States%20of%20Australia\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. With an area of , it is &lt;a href=\"states%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia\"&gt;Australia's sixth largest state/territory&lt;/a&gt;, comparable in size to the island of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Utah\"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;. It is bound to the northwest by &lt;a href=\"South%20Australia\"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;, directly north by &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, and also shares a &lt;a href=\"maritime%20border\"&gt;maritime border&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Tasmania\"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Bass%20Strait\"&gt;Bass Strait&lt;/a&gt; to the south. Most of Victoria's northern border lies along the &lt;a href=\"Murray%20River\"&gt;Murray River&lt;/a&gt;. The eastern half of the state is dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Alps\"&gt;Australian Alps&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding &lt;a href=\"highland\"&gt;highland&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"plateau\"&gt;plateau&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hill\"&gt;hill&lt;/a&gt;s) of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dividing%20Range\"&gt;Great Dividing Range&lt;/a&gt;, which also to a lesser extent extend far into the west of the state and ease off after &lt;a href=\"Grampians%20National%20Park\"&gt;The Grampians&lt;/a&gt;. By comparison the north and northwest of the state is extremely flat with little &lt;a href=\"prominence\"&gt;prominence&lt;/a&gt;.\nApproximately 80% of Victoria's population lives around the coasts of the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Phillip%20Bay\"&gt;Port Phillip Bay&lt;/a&gt; and (to a lesser extent) &lt;a href=\"Western%20Port%20Bay\"&gt;Western Port Bay&lt;/a&gt; in the south-central region, chiefly in the state's two largest cities, &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"list%20of%20Australian%20capital%20cities\"&gt;state capital&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Geelong\"&gt;Geelong&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegional divisions.\nThe geography of Victoria has several different divisions depending on the aspect of the geography in question. Geomorphological divisions are listed in the following sections. From a human geographical perspective, the state is divided up into the following regions:\nEastern Uplands (&lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Alps\"&gt;Victorian Alps&lt;/a&gt;).\nTopography and hydrology.\nCentred on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dividing%20Range\"&gt;main divide&lt;/a&gt; in eastern Victoria, the Eastern Uplands separate the streams and rivers draining north to the &lt;a href=\"Murray-Darling%20Basin\"&gt;Murray-Darling Basin&lt;/a&gt; from those flowing southwards directly to the sea. It is the largest and most diverse geomorphic region in the State.\nThe main streams draining northwards are the &lt;a href=\"Goulburn%20River%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Goulburn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Campaspe%20River%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Campaspe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mitta%20Mitta%20River\"&gt;Mitta Mitta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kiewa%20River\"&gt;Kiewa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loddon%20River%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Loddon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avoca%20River\"&gt;Avoca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wimmera%20River\"&gt;Wimmera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ovens%20River\"&gt;Ovens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20River%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;King Rivers&lt;/a&gt;. The most important streams flowing southwards to the sea are the &lt;a href=\"Latrobe%20River\"&gt;Latrobe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomson%20River%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Thomson&lt;/a&gt;, Macalister, &lt;a href=\"Mitchell%20River%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tambo%20River%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Tambo&lt;/a&gt;, Nicholson and &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20River\"&gt;Snowy River&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"tributary\"&gt;tributaries&lt;/a&gt;. All these rivers, with the exception of the Snowy River, reach the sea through the Gippsland Lakes of south-eastern Victoria. Further east, the &lt;a href=\"Bemm%20River%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Bemm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cann%20River%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Cann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genoa%20River\"&gt;Genoa River&lt;/a&gt;s flow directly into &lt;a href=\"Bass%20Strait\"&gt;Bass Strait&lt;/a&gt; to drain the eastern division of the Eastern Uplands. The &lt;a href=\"Yarra%20River\"&gt;Yarra River&lt;/a&gt;, flowing into &lt;a href=\"Port%20Phillip%20Bay\"&gt;Port Phillip Bay&lt;/a&gt;, drains the southwest area of the Uplands. The south-west of the state is dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Hopkins%20River\"&gt;Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glenelg%20River%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Glenelg&lt;/a&gt; rivers. The longest river in Victoria is the Goulburn, which rises below the peak of Corn Hill (1,331\u00a0m) and flows into the Murray river near &lt;a href=\"Echuca\"&gt;Echuca&lt;/a&gt;. It is over 650 kilometers long.\nMajor peaks on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dividing%20Range\"&gt;Great Divide&lt;/a&gt; in the Eastern Uplands include &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Cobberas\"&gt;Mount Cobberas&lt;/a&gt; (1,833\u00a0m) near the border with New South Wales, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hotham\"&gt;Mount Hotham&lt;/a&gt; (1,862\u00a0m) and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Howitt\"&gt;Mount Howitt&lt;/a&gt; (1,746\u00a0m). Victoria's highest mountain, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Bogong\"&gt;Mount Bogong&lt;/a&gt; (1,986\u00a0m), is just north of the main range on a ridge that separates the upper reaches of the Mitta Mitta River from the Kiewa River. Other prominent peaks are &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Feathertop\"&gt;Mount Feathertop&lt;/a&gt; (1,922\u00a0m), also to the north of the Divide, and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Buller\"&gt;Mount Buller&lt;/a&gt; (1,804\u00a0m) to the north west of Mount Howitt. &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Wellington%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Mount Wellington&lt;/a&gt; (1,632\u00a0m) lies at the southern end of the &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Mountains\"&gt;Snowy Range&lt;/a&gt;. The highest point south of the main divide is &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Reynard\"&gt;Mount Reynard&lt;/a&gt; which lies at an elevation of 1,737\u00a0meters.\nDendritic patterns of narrow ridges and valleys are typical of the region and characterise much of the deeply dissected landscape on either side of the Great Divide. Occasional isolated summits such as Mount Buller and Feathertop stand above the remnant plateaus or broad ridges.\nExtensive landscapes of low relief occur at higher altitudes in the form of &lt;a href=\"plateau\"&gt;plateau&lt;/a&gt;s such as the &lt;a href=\"Bogong%20High%20Plains\"&gt;Bogong High Plains&lt;/a&gt;, the plateaus of Mount Buffalo (about 1,400\u00a0m) and the &lt;a href=\"Baw%20Baw%20Plateau\"&gt;Baw Baw Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, which are collectively commonly referred to as \u201chigh plains\u201d. Extensive plateaus at successively lower elevations also frequent the further they are from the main divide. These include the &lt;a href=\"Pinnibar\"&gt;Pinnibar&lt;/a&gt; plateau in the north-east, &lt;a href=\"Nunniong\"&gt;Nunniong&lt;/a&gt; plains to the south (about 1,200\u00a0m), and the &lt;a href=\"Koetong\"&gt;Koetong&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Shelly%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Shelly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wabonga\"&gt;Wabonga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strathbogie%20Ranges\"&gt;Strathbogie&lt;/a&gt; plateaus further north (about 600\u20131,100\u00a0m).\nThe northerly draining valleys widen and the stream gradients gradually decrease as they near the Riverine Plain to the north and west of the region. The lower reaches of these streams have flood plains of fine sediments flanked by several sets of terraces. Alluvial or colluvial formations emerge from minor valleys of small ephemeral streams that drain the interfluves of major valleys. The ridges, as they approach the lowland plains, give way to low hills which mark the later stages of erosion of the upland ridges.\nThe floodplain and terraces of the Murray River at &lt;a href=\"Wodonga\"&gt;Wodonga&lt;/a&gt; indicate the eastern edge of the Northern Riverine Plain and the northern edge of the Eastern Uplands, at which point the floodplain is only about 150\u00a0m above sea level, consequently causing the flow of the major river systems in the region to have carved deep, narrow valleys in their upper reaches over time where the gradients are much steeper than along the floodplains.\nSouth of the Great Divide the river systems increase in gradient and valley depth, and as they approach the Eastern Plain, having narrower alluviated valleys than those in the north. Large lowland areas enclosed by steep ridges such as the Murmungee basin south of &lt;a href=\"Beechworth%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Beechworth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dargo%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Dargo&lt;/a&gt; area south of the Divide, occur in parts of the Eastern Uplands. These are found where more readily weathered and eroded rocks occur surrounded by resistant rocks. The southern boundary of the Eastern Uplands is the southern extremity of an uneven bench-like platform known as the Nillumbik Terrain, which can be traced bordering the Eastern Plain from near &lt;a href=\"Orbost%2C%20Victoria\"&gt;Orbost&lt;/a&gt; to the eastern suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. The Eastern Uplands extend to the coast from Cape Conran to Rams Head, where the Nillumbik Terrain is absent, and is fringed with coastal sand dunes in parts.\nBotany.\nTall, thick forests of &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20Ash\"&gt;Alpine Ash&lt;/a&gt; occur on the upper mountain slopes, while the world's tallest &lt;a href=\"hardwood\"&gt;hardwood&lt;/a&gt; tree, &lt;a href=\"Eucalyptus%20regnans\"&gt;Mountain Ash&lt;/a&gt;, is found at slightly lower altitudes in the west of the region, with a typical variety of mixed-species &lt;a href=\"eucalypt\"&gt;eucalypt&lt;/a&gt;s in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Leptospermum\"&gt;Ti-Tree&lt;/a&gt; shrubs composing the remainder of the forested portion of the Eastern Uplands.\nThe high plains are dominated by &lt;a href=\"grassland\"&gt;grassland&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"herbfield\"&gt;herbfield&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Heath%20%28habitat%29\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt; communities which are widespread in areas where cold air drainage limits woody plant growth, with &lt;a href=\"sphagnum\"&gt;sphagnum&lt;/a&gt; bogs and fens in permanently wet areas. Snow Gum woodlands occupy the rocky knolls and ridges above approximately 1400\u20131500\u00a0m."
