In 2014, Marvelous AQL stated that they had hired former \"Rune Factory\" developers, including Hashimoto, to develop \"\". In 2018 Hashimoto left his executive officer role and opened Hakama, a new studio under Marvelous, where he went to work on \"&lt;a href=\"Rune%20Factory%204%20Special\"&gt;Rune Factory 4 Special&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Rune Factory 5\".\nThe game was announced in February 2019 and was planned to be released in 2020 before being delayed.
