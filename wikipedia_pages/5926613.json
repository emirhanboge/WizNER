    "text": "Vicente Leonidas Saadi (1913 \u2013 10 July 1988) was an &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Justicialist%20Party\"&gt;Justicialist Party&lt;/a&gt; politician. He was a &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Senate\"&gt;senator&lt;/a&gt; and governor for &lt;a href=\"Catamarca%20Province\"&gt;Catamarca Province&lt;/a&gt;, and became the patriarch of a family that has dominated Catamarca politics since the 1940s.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Bel%C3%A9n%2C%20Catamarca\"&gt;Bel\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;, his family were prosperous &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n immigrants who became prominent in local &lt;a href=\"commerce\"&gt;commerce&lt;/a&gt;. He allied himself with the centrist &lt;a href=\"Radical%20Civic%20Union\"&gt;Radical Civic Union&lt;/a&gt; (UCR) early on, though after the rise of populist leader &lt;a href=\"Juan%20Per%C3%B3n\"&gt;Juan Per\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; in 1945, he switched allegiances for the latter.\nSaadi was elected Senator in 1946, serving until 1949 when he was elected on the &lt;a href=\"Peronist\"&gt;Peronist&lt;/a&gt; ticket as Governor of Catamarca. The party's leader, President Per\u00f3n, ordered Saadi removed from his post after four months, however, amid allegations of \"&lt;a href=\"nepotism\"&gt;nepotism&lt;/a&gt; and despotism\" in his administration of the remote province. Saadi was subsequently expelled from the party, and served time in prison.\nHe was married to Alicia Cubas de Saadi, and a number of their children went on to become leading Catamarca Province figures, as well. &lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20Saadi\"&gt;Ram\u00f3n Saadi&lt;/a&gt; was elected governor of Catamarca in 1987, &lt;a href=\"Alicia%20Saadi\"&gt;Alicia Saadi&lt;/a&gt; was elected to the Senate in 1999, and &lt;a href=\"Vicente%20Saadi%20%28younger%29\"&gt;Vicente Saadi&lt;/a&gt; (jr) and his daughter-in-law.\nHe was ultimately re-elected to the Senate in 1973 on behalf of the Peronist-led &lt;a href=\"Justicialist%20Party\"&gt;Frejuli&lt;/a&gt; alliance, serving until the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Senate\"&gt;Argentine Senate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"March%201976%20coup\"&gt;March 1976 coup&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1970s Saadi had been a leading supporter of the far-left &lt;a href=\"Montoneros\"&gt;Montoneros&lt;/a&gt;, and set up the \"Intransigencia y Movilizaci\u00f3n\" faction; he was a patron of future Defense Minister &lt;a href=\"Nilda%20Garr%C3%A9\"&gt;Nilda Garr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"1983%20Argentine%20general%20election\"&gt;Re-elected in 1983&lt;/a&gt; at the return of democracy, Saadi led the Justicialists in the Senate, where the party obtained a majority of 21 seats to 18 for the UCR. Saadi abandoned his earlier support for left-wing Peronists, and endorsed &lt;a href=\"Herminio%20Iglesias\"&gt;Herminio Iglesias&lt;/a&gt; as candidate in the race for &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Governor of Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; (the nation's largest province). Iglesias, a right-wing Peronist, lost the race, and despite the miscalculation, Saadi was elected Vice-President of the party. In that capacity, he worked closely with the leader of the UCR, President-elect &lt;a href=\"Raul%20Alfons%C3%ADn\"&gt;Raul Alfons\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, during the transition to democracy.\nSaadi later took part in a famous television debate with &lt;a href=\"Dante%20Caputo\"&gt;Dante Caputo&lt;/a&gt; on November 14, 1984, arguing against the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Peace%20and%20Friendship%20of%201984%20between%20Chile%20and%20Argentina\"&gt;Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. In 1987 he swapped jobs with his son, Ram\u00f3n, becoming governor once again whilst his son became a Senator. He remained powerful in the party, and that year, decided that the Justicialist Party would not pay the $8 million ransom demanded for the return of the &lt;a href=\"Hands%20of%20Per%C3%B3n\"&gt;hands of Juan Per\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, which had been stolen in June or July of that year. Vicente died in office.\nSaadi was a leading figure in the politics of his province and the left-wing of his party, serving as vice-President of the &lt;a href=\"Peronist\"&gt;Peronist&lt;/a&gt;s and considered a \"&lt;a href=\"caudillo\"&gt;caudillo&lt;/a&gt;\" for his manner of control. He was one of the first prominent &lt;a href=\"Syrian\"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt;-Argentines and his name is recorded in streets, squares and other institutions around the country."
