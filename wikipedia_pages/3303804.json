    "text": "Andrew Talcott (1797\u20131883) was an American &lt;a href=\"civil%20engineer\"&gt;civil engineer&lt;/a&gt; and close friend of &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; General &lt;a href=\"Robert%20E.%20Lee\"&gt;Robert E. Lee&lt;/a&gt;. He did not serve during the Civil War, as he could not fight against the Union, nor fight against his brothers in the South. He traveled to Veracruz, Mexico to work on the Railroad. Coming back with the President to New York for supplies he was arrested and placed at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Lafayette\"&gt;Fort Lafayette&lt;/a&gt; accused of being a spy for the Confederate States of America. He was moved to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Warren%20%28Massachusetts%29\"&gt;Fort Warren&lt;/a&gt; in Boston harbor under orders of General &lt;a href=\"John%20E.%20Wool\"&gt;John E. Wool&lt;/a&gt;. General &lt;a href=\"John%20Adams%20Dix\"&gt;John A. Dix&lt;/a&gt; was placed in the command of the Eastern Military Department. Knowing Captain Andrew well and believing his loyalty to the Union he was released.\nEarly life.\nTalcott was born on April 20, 1797, in &lt;a href=\"Glastonbury%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Glastonbury, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;. He attended &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;West Point&lt;/a&gt;, 1818, graduating second in class. In the Engineers, he was garrisoned at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Atkinson%20%28Nebraska%29\"&gt;Fort Atkinson&lt;/a&gt; and explored the passage to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Snelling%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Fort Snelling&lt;/a&gt; in 1820. His brother was General &lt;a href=\"George%20Talcott\"&gt;George Talcott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Ordnance%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army\"&gt;Chief of the Ordnance Corps&lt;/a&gt;. His granddaughter Lucia Beverly Talcott (born 1865) married the famous statistician and inventor &lt;a href=\"Herman%20Hollerith\"&gt;Herman Hollerith&lt;/a&gt; in 1890. He is a descendant of Joseph Talcott, Colony of &lt;a href=\"Connecticut\"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; Governor from 1724\u20131741, and John Talcott, one of the founders of &lt;a href=\"Hartford%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Hartford, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nTalcott's career was as a military and civil engineer building forts, roads and railroads both in the States and Mexico. He started the 1824 construction of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Adams\"&gt;Fort Adams&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Newport, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;. In 1833 he extended a previously invented method of finding &lt;a href=\"Latitude\"&gt;latitudinal&lt;/a&gt; direction. He rediscovered the method to determine a place's &lt;a href=\"latitude\"&gt;latitude&lt;/a&gt; from the stars, a method originally invented by the Danish astronomer &lt;a href=\"Peder%20Horrebow\"&gt;Peder Horrebow&lt;/a&gt;. On further developing Horrebow's method, it subsequently came to be known as the \"Horrebow-Talcott Method\". The so-called Horrebow-Talcott method fixed latitude \"by observing differences of &lt;a href=\"zenith\"&gt;zenith&lt;/a&gt; distances of stars culminating within a short time of each other, and at nearly the same &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt;, on opposite sides of the zenith.\"\nHe was hired as superintending engineer for construction on the &lt;a href=\"Hampton%20Roads\"&gt;Hampton Roads&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Wool\"&gt;Fort Calhoun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Monroe\"&gt;Fort Monroe&lt;/a&gt; becoming a superior and friend to the future general, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20E.%20Lee\"&gt;Robert E. Lee&lt;/a&gt; and married Harriet Randolph Hackley at &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Norfolk, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, in 1832. (His wife was also to become a close platonic companion to General Lee.) Talcott surveyed the &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; border with Lee in the spring of 1835. With the rank of captain, he resigned his commission in 1836 and by 1839 he was a &lt;a href=\"civil%20engineer\"&gt;civil engineer&lt;/a&gt; and surveyor of the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20Delta\"&gt;Mississippi river delta&lt;/a&gt; together with a young &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Gray%20%28surveyor%29\"&gt;A. B. (Andrew) Gray&lt;/a&gt;. In 1838, Talcott was elected as a member to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Philosophical%20Society\"&gt;American Philosophical Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nTalcott was considered for the post of Superintendent of the Coast Survey which was subsequently filled by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Dallas%20Bache\"&gt;Alexander Bache&lt;/a&gt; in 1843, but he went on to supervise construction of the &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20and%20Danville%20Railroad\"&gt;Richmond and Danville Railroad&lt;/a&gt; in 1849, where he was later appointed general manager. Talcott became chief engineer and superintendent of the &lt;a href=\"Ohio%20and%20Mississippi%20Railway\"&gt;Ohio and Mississippi Railroad&lt;/a&gt; and later appeared as a consultant at the Coroner's jury for the &lt;a href=\"Desjardins%20Canal%20disaster\"&gt;Desjardins Canal disaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Hamilton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, 1857.\nMexican Railroad.\nHe was engaged as an engineer late in 1857 by A. Escandon who, with English financing, planned to connect &lt;a href=\"Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz\"&gt;Veracruz&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Mexico%20City\"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; by rail via Cordova and &lt;a href=\"Orizaba%2C%20Veracruz\"&gt;Orizaba&lt;/a&gt;, supervising W. W. Finney of the &lt;a href=\"Pony%20Express\"&gt;Pony Express&lt;/a&gt;. When Escandon purchased the fourth concession from Mosso brothers in 1856, two routes were considered and Talcott was assigned the far more difficult southern passage probably due financial stakes held near Orizaba by the project's investors. The Northern passage was explored by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20110711063307/http%3A//www.estaciontorreon.galeon.com/productos627821.html\"&gt;Pascual Almaz\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;. It was supposed to be the steepest railway undertaken up to that time, rising in a distance of and to span the Metlac River was an English-made iron bridge high.\nCivil War.\nAt the request of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20E.%20Lee\"&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt;, Talcott accepted the positions of Colonel and State Engineer of &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; in 1861. Talcott was charged with the coastal defense of &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20River%20%28Virginia%29\"&gt;James river&lt;/a&gt;. After rebuilding the star-shaped &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Boykin\"&gt;Fort Boykin&lt;/a&gt; and building &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Huger\"&gt;Fort Huger&lt;/a&gt;, the forts were later crippled by the ironclad corvette &lt;a href=\"USS%20Galena%20%281862%29\"&gt;USS Galena&lt;/a&gt;'s squadron. Talcott was arrested in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, March 1863, only to be held at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Warren%20%28Massachusetts%29\"&gt;Fort Warren&lt;/a&gt; in Massachusetts as a Mexican citizen. He returned to a &lt;a href=\"French%20intervention%20in%20Mexico\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;-reorganized Mexican project in the late 1860s under a new concession where he remained until &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Ju%C3%A1rez\"&gt;Ju\u00e1rez&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Maximilian%20I%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;Maximilian&lt;/a&gt;'s conservative regime in 1867.\nPersonal life.\nAs a co-claimant he filed an unsuccessful suit before the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; in 1853, regarding &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; land deeded to his father-in-law Richard S. Hackley by the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Alagon\"&gt;Duke of Alagon&lt;/a&gt; in 1819. In his later years, along with his son, Thomas Mann Randolph Talcott, Talcott invested in development in &lt;a href=\"Bon%20Air%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Bon Air, VA&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nTalcott died on Sunday 22 April 1883 at his residence, 519 East Leigh Street in Richmond, Virginia, aged 87, remembered for building the Richmond and Danville Railroad."
