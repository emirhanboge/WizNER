    "text": "Yubileyniy is an &lt;a href=\"airport\"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kyzylorda%20Oblast\"&gt;Kyzylorda Oblast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of the &lt;a href=\"Baikonur%20cosmodrome\"&gt;Baikonur cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt;. It sits 40\u00a0km north-north-west of &lt;a href=\"Baikonur\"&gt;Baikonur&lt;/a&gt; (at the site of 251 cosmodrome &lt;a href=\"Baikonur\"&gt;Baikonur&lt;/a&gt;) in the &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; region of Ushkyzyl.\nThe airport is leased by &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; from Kazakhstan as part of the \u201c&lt;a href=\"Baikonur\"&gt;Baikonur&lt;/a&gt;\u201d complex. The aerodrome operator is FSUE \u201cTsENKI\u201d.\nYubileyniy airfield supports all types of aircraft, including &lt;a href=\"An-225\"&gt;An-225&lt;/a&gt; \"Mriya\". The &lt;a href=\"maximum%20take-off%20weight\"&gt;maximum take-off weight&lt;/a&gt; is 392 metric tons.\nHistory.\nThe airfield was built in the early 1980s for the development of the &lt;a href=\"Buran%20%28spacecraft%29\"&gt;Buran&lt;/a&gt; reusable spacecraft program. The decree establishing the landing complex was adopted in October 1977. The airfield received the name \"Jubilee,\" in connection with the 60th anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"October%20Revolution\"&gt;October Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. NPO Molniya was appointed the lead developer of the complex. The 20th Central Design Institute of the USSR Ministry of Defense carried out the design.\nIn 1979, crews from the 130th Engineering Department began construction on the 4500\u00a0x 84\u00a0m &lt;a href=\"runway\"&gt;runway&lt;/a&gt;. The runway used M-600 monolithic high-strength concrete with a thickness of 26\u201332\u00a0cm on a sand-cement foundation with a thickness of 18 to 22\u00a0cm. The total excavation volume was about 2\u00a0million\u00a0m3. The first facilities were commissioned in November 1981.\nThe first landing was made in February 1980 by an &lt;a href=\"Mi-8\"&gt;Mi-8 helicopter&lt;/a&gt; from the aviation regiment of the Baikonur Cosmodrome\". On January 29, 1982, an &lt;a href=\"An-26\"&gt;An-26&lt;/a&gt; landed.\nThe first transportation to Baikonur of elements of the reusable space system \u201c&lt;a href=\"Energia\"&gt;Energia&lt;/a&gt; - Buran\u201d by plane (&lt;a href=\"VM-T\"&gt;VM-T&lt;/a&gt;) took place on April 8, 1982. From 1982 to 1990, 59 &lt;a href=\"VM-T\"&gt;VM-T&lt;/a&gt; flights were made to deliver large elements of the space complexes \"Energy\" and &lt;a href=\"Buran%20%28spacecraft%29\"&gt;Buran&lt;/a&gt;. Buran spacecraft were transported to the &lt;a href=\"Ramenskoye%20%28airport%29\"&gt;Ramenskoye&lt;/a&gt; airfield near Moscow and the units of the Energia launch vehicle - from Izymyanka airfield in Kuibyshev (now &lt;a href=\"Samara\"&gt;Samara&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe airfield belonged to the &lt;a href=\"USSR%20Ministry%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/a&gt;. After 1992, the airfield was abandoned and partially looted.\nIn 1995, the need arose to support heavy aircraft from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, launching US spacecraft under international commercial programs. Yubileyny became Khrunichev Space Center, the manufacturer of &lt;a href=\"Proton%20%28launch%20vehicle%29\"&gt;Proton&lt;/a&gt; heavy launch vehicles. Recruitment for civil aerodrome personnel was initiated. Radio navigation, radio communications, lighting, meteorological and other equipment were updated, and the runway was overhauled. In 1997, these works were completed and the experimental airfield was put into operation.\nFrom 1997 to 2011, the aerodrome received passenger flights carrying administrative and technical personnel. In 2017, the airfield was transferred to the FSUE \"&lt;a href=\"TsENKI\"&gt;TsENKI&lt;/a&gt;\". A reconstruction of the airfield was planned for 2018.\nGeography.\nThe terrain is a slightly wavy &lt;a href=\"plain\"&gt;plain&lt;/a&gt; (altitude 95\u2013120\u00a0m). 4\u00a0km northeast of the airfield is Ushk\u0131z\u0131l &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; (altitude 135\u00a0m).\nFlora include wormwood-boylychy (northern) desert. The &lt;a href=\"soils\"&gt;soils&lt;/a&gt; are brown desert-steppe. 8\u00a0km north of the airfield are &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; Darbas.\nNo permanent watercourses and reservoirs are nearby. In the spring, after snowmelt and rain, \"takyr\", small temporary lakes up to 0.5\u00a0m deep form."
