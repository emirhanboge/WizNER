View Street was closed off, and a pedestrian area was created, set off by restored historic buildings on three sides and a view across the harbour on the fourth.\nHistoric buildings on the square include Burnes House, the Beaver Building, the &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20Trade%20Building%20%28Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia%29\"&gt;Board of Trade Building&lt;/a&gt;, Chancery Chambers, Law Chambers, the Rithet Building, and the Supreme Court Building.\nEvents held at the square include the Bastion Square &lt;a href=\"Marketplace\"&gt;Public Market&lt;/a&gt;, the Holiday Market, and the Art Walk."
