    "title": "Shell plating",
    "text": "Shell plating is the outer-most structure on the &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrakes.\nA &lt;a href=\"strake\"&gt;strake&lt;/a&gt; is the name given to each line of planking in a wooden vessel. In modern ship construction it refers to the longitudinal run of plating covering the hull, deck and bulkhead structure. Certain specific strakes are uniquely identified:\n&lt;a href=\"Keel\"&gt;Keel&lt;/a&gt;: is a special strake of the Bottom plating extending from the centerplane outboard.\nBottom: the Bottom Shell plate strakes extend from the Keel to the Bilge.\n&lt;a href=\"Bilge\"&gt;Bilge&lt;/a&gt;: is the plating which transitions from the more-or-less horizontal Bottom Shell to the more-or-less vertical Side Shell and is generally curved. See also &lt;a href=\"Chine%20%28boating%29\"&gt;Chine (boating)&lt;/a&gt;.\nSide: is the plating which extends from the Bilge strake(s) to the Shear strake.\nShear: is a special strake of the Side plating. It is the strake that connects the Side Shell to the Strength Deck.\nStringer: is a special strake of the Strength Deck plating. It is the strake that connects the Strength Deck to the Side Shell.\nStrength Deck: is a special deck. It is normally the uppermost continuous deck and forms the top flange of the hull girder."
