It established an orthodox dogmatic guideline based on &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20holy%20books\"&gt;scriptural authority&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rationality\"&gt;rationality&lt;/a&gt;, and semi-&lt;a href=\"rationalism\"&gt;rationalism&lt;/a&gt;. Ash\u02bfarism is regarded as the single most important school of Islamic theology in the &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20Islam\"&gt;history of Islam&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe disciples of the school are known as Ash\u02bfarites, and the school is also referred to as the Ash\u02bfarite school, which became one of the dominant theological schools within Sunni Islam. Ash\u02bfar\u012b theology is considered one of the orthodox creeds of Sunni Islam, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Traditionalist%20theology%20%28Islam%29\"&gt;A\u1e6fhar\u012b&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maturidi\"&gt;M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmongst the most famous Ash\u02bfarite theologians are &lt;a href=\"Imam%20Nawawi\"&gt;Imam Nawawi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20Hajar%20al-Asqalani\"&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20al-Jawzi\"&gt;Ibn al-Jawzi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"al-Ghazali\"&gt;al-Ghazali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"al-Suyuti\"&gt;al-Suyuti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Izz%20al-Din%20ibn%20%27Abd%20al-Salam\"&gt;Izz al-Din ibn 'Abd al-Salam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fakhr%20al-Din%20al-Razi\"&gt;Fakhr al-Din al-Razi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20%27Asakir\"&gt;Ibn 'Asakir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taj%20al-Din%20al-Subki\"&gt;al-Subki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"al-Taftazani\"&gt;al-Taftazani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"al-Baqillani\"&gt;al-Baqillani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"al-Bayhaqi\"&gt;al-Bayhaqi&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFounder.\n&lt;a href=\"Al-Ash%27ari\"&gt;Ab\u016b al-\u1e24asan al-Ash\u02bfar\u012b&lt;/a&gt; was noted for his teachings on &lt;a href=\"atomism\"&gt;atomism&lt;/a&gt;, among the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Islamic%20philosophy\"&gt;earliest Islamic philosophies&lt;/a&gt;, and for al-Ash\u02bfar\u012b this was the basis for propagating the view that &lt;a href=\"God%20in%20Islam\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; created every moment in &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; and every particle of &lt;a href=\"matter\"&gt;matter&lt;/a&gt;. He nonetheless believed in &lt;a href=\"Free%20will%20in%20theology\"&gt;free will&lt;/a&gt;, elaborating the thoughts of Dirar ibn 'Amr and &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Hanifa\"&gt;Abu Hanifa&lt;/a&gt; into a \"dual agent\" or \"acquisition\" (\"iktisab\") account of free will.\nWhile al-Ash\u02bfar\u012b opposed the views of the rival &lt;a href=\"Mu%CA%BFtazila\"&gt;Mu\u02bftazilite school&lt;/a&gt;, he was also opposed to the view which &lt;a href=\"Bi-la%20kaifa\"&gt;rejected all debate&lt;/a&gt;, held by certain schools such as the &lt;a href=\"Zahiri\"&gt;Zahiri&lt;/a&gt; (\"literalist\"), &lt;a href=\"Mujassimite\"&gt;Mujassimite&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Anthropotheism\"&gt;anthropotheist&lt;/a&gt;\"), and &lt;a href=\"Muhaddith\"&gt;Muhaddith&lt;/a&gt;in (\"&lt;a href=\"Traditionalist%20theology%20%28Islam%29\"&gt;traditionalist&lt;/a&gt;\") schools for their over-emphasis on \"&lt;a href=\"taqlid\"&gt;taqlid&lt;/a&gt;\" (imitation) in his \"Istihsan al\u2011Khaud\":\nDevelopment.\nAsh\u02bfarism became the main school of &lt;a href=\"early%20Islamic%20philosophy\"&gt;early Islamic philosophy&lt;/a&gt; whereby it was originally based on the foundations laid down by al-Ash\u02bfar\u012b, who founded the Ash\u02bfarite school in the 10th century based on the methodology taught to him by his teacher Abdullah ibn Sa'eed ibn Kullaab. However, the Ash\u02bfarite school underwent many changes throughout history, resulting in the term \"Ash\u02bfar\u012b\" being extremely broad in its modern usage (e.g. differences between &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20Furak\"&gt;Ibn Furak&lt;/a&gt; (d. AH 406) and &lt;a href=\"al-Bayhaqi\"&gt;al-Bayhaqi&lt;/a&gt; (d. AH 384)).\nFor example, the Ash\u02bfarite view was that comprehension of the &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20of%20God%20in%20Islam\"&gt;unique nature and characteristics&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"God%20in%20Islam\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; were beyond human capability. The solution proposed by al-Ash\u02bfar\u012b to solve the problems of \"tashbih\" and \"ta'til\" concedes that the Supreme Being possesses in a real sense the divine attributes and &lt;a href=\"Names%20of%20God%20in%20Islam\"&gt;names&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in the Quran. Insofar as these names and attributes have a positive reality, they are distinct from the essence, but nevertheless they don't have either existence or reality apart from it.\nThe inspiration of al-Ash\u02bfar\u012b in this matter was on the one hand to distinguish essence and attribute as concepts, and on the other hand to see that the duality between essence and attribute should be situated not on the quantitative but on the qualitative level \u2014 something which &lt;a href=\"Mu%CA%BFtazila\"&gt;Mu\u02bftazilite thinking&lt;/a&gt; had failed to grasp. Ash\u02bfarite theologians were referred to as the \"muthbita\" (\"those who make firm\") by the Mu\u02bftazilites.\nBeliefs.\nThe Ash\u02bfarite view holds that:\nAsh\u02bfarites also hold beliefs about Allah's attributes that are unique to them, such as:\nLater Ash\u02bfarism.\nNicholas Heer writes that later Ash\u02bfarite theologians \"increasingly attempted to rationalize Islamic doctrine\" from about the 12th century onwards. Theologians such as al-Taft\u0101z\u0101n\u012b and al-Jurj\u0101n\u012b argued that the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20holy%20books\"&gt;Islamic sacred scriptures&lt;/a&gt; (the Quran and the \"\u1e25ad\u012bth\") \"must be proven to be true by rational arguments\" before being \"accepted as the basis of the religion\". Educated Muslims \"must be convinced on the basis of rational arguments\" and not revelation that Islam is true. A series of rational proofs were developed by these Ash\u02bfarite theologians, including proofs for \"the following doctrines or propositions\": \nCriticism.\nThe medieval Muslim scholar &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20Taymiyyah\"&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah&lt;/a&gt; criticised the Ash\u02bfar\u012b theology as (in the words of one historian, &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20A.%20C.%20Brown\"&gt;Jonathan A. C. Brown&lt;/a&gt;) \"a Greek solution to Greek problems\" that should \"never\" have concerned Muslims. Both Ibn Taymiyyah and &lt;a href=\"Shah%20Waliullah%20Dehlawi\"&gt;Shah Waliullah Dehlawi&lt;/a&gt; rejected the lack of literalism in Ash\u02bfar\u012b \"speculative theology\" and advocated \"straightforward acceptance of God's description of Himself\".\nIn contrast, German scholar &lt;a href=\"Eduard%20Sachau\"&gt;Eduard Sachau&lt;/a&gt; affirms that the Ash\u02bfar\u012b theology and its biggest defender, &lt;a href=\"al-Ghazali\"&gt;al-Ghazali&lt;/a&gt;, was too literal and responsible for the decline of Islamic science starting in the 10th century. Sachau stated that the two clerics were the only obstacle to the Muslim world becoming a nation of \"&lt;a href=\"Galileo%20Galilei\"&gt;Galileos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Kepler\"&gt;Keplers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton\"&gt;Newtons&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20E.%20B.%20Lumbard\"&gt;Joseph E. B. Lumbard&lt;/a&gt; offered a different view, affirming that there is no historical evidence to substantiate such a claim, and that science continued to prosper in the &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20world\"&gt;Muslim world&lt;/a&gt;. He asserts that this viewpoint originates from a poor reading of al-Ghazali's warning against the abuse of new technology and how it can disrupt and harm society if not properly implemented, similar to how nuclear weapons, artificial intelligence, and stem cell research today are restricted to a degree for &lt;a href=\"Bioethics\"&gt;ethical reasons&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ziauddin%20Sardar\"&gt;Ziauddin Sardar&lt;/a&gt; states that some of the greatest &lt;a href=\"Science%20in%20medieval%20Islam\"&gt;Muslim scientists&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20Golden%20Age\"&gt;Islamic Golden Age&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Ibn%20al-Haytham\"&gt;Ibn al-Haytham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ab%C5%AB%20Rayh%C4%81n%20al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB\"&gt;Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b&lt;/a&gt;, who were pioneers of the &lt;a href=\"scientific%20method\"&gt;scientific method&lt;/a&gt;, were themselves followers of the Ash\u02bfar\u012b school of Islamic theology. Like other Ash\u02bfarites who believed that faith or \"taqlid\" should be applied only to Islam and not to any &lt;a href=\"Hellenistic%20civilization\"&gt;ancient Hellenistic&lt;/a&gt; authorities, Ibn al-Haytham's view that \"taqlid\" should be applied only to the &lt;a href=\"Prophets%20in%20Islam\"&gt;prophets and messengers of Islam&lt;/a&gt; and not to any other authorities formed the basis for much of his &lt;a href=\"scientific%20skepticism\"&gt;scientific skepticism&lt;/a&gt; and criticism against &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy\"&gt;Ptolemy&lt;/a&gt; and other ancient authorities in his \"Doubts Concerning Ptolemy\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Optics\"&gt;Book of Optics&lt;/a&gt;\"."
