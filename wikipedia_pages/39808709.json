    "text": "During the Parade of Nations portion of the &lt;a href=\"1992%20Summer%20Olympics%20opening%20ceremony\"&gt;1992 Summer Olympics opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, athletes from each country participating in the Olympics paraded in the arena, preceded by their flag. The flag was borne by a sportsperson from that country chosen either by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;National Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; or by the athletes themselves to represent their country.\nParade order.\nAs the nation of the &lt;a href=\"1896%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; modern &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20Games\"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; entered the stadium first; whereas, the host nation &lt;a href=\"Spain%20at%20the%201992%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; marched last. Other countries entered in alphabetical order in the &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French language&lt;/a&gt;, instead of both &lt;a href=\"Catalan%20language\"&gt;Catalan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; (despite that these languages had been displayed on the name boards and used to announce the country names), due to the political sensitivity surrounding the use of Catalan. Athletes from &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Olympic%20Participants%20at%20the%201992%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Independent Olympic Participants&lt;/a&gt; did not attend the parade of nations, but still competed at the Games. The &lt;a href=\"Unified%20Team%20at%20the%201992%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;Unified Team&lt;/a&gt; that was composed of former Soviet states, marched with Olympic flag, then followed by 12 flag bearers carrying the flags of 12 &lt;a href=\"Post-Soviet%20states\"&gt;nations&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhilst most countries entered under their &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20sovereign%20states\"&gt;short names&lt;/a&gt;, a few entered under more formal or alternative names, mostly due to political and naming disputes. The &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (commonly known as Taiwan) entered with the compromised &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Taipei\"&gt;name&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20Taipei%20Olympic%20flag\"&gt;flag&lt;/a&gt; of \"Chinese Taipei\" (\"Taipei chinois\") under T so that they did not enter together with &lt;a href=\"Two%20Chinas\"&gt;conflicting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (commonly known as China), which entered as the \"People's Republic of China\" (\"R\u00e9publique Populair\u00e9 de Chine\") under C. The &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; entered as the \"Republic of the Congo\" (\"R\u00e9publique du Congo\") while the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt; entered under its former name, &lt;a href=\"Zaire\"&gt;Zaire&lt;/a&gt;.\nList.\nThe following is a list of each country's announced flag bearer. The list is sorted by the order in which each nation appears in the parade of nations. The names are given in their official designations by the IOC."
