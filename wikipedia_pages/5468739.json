    "text": "The Carry On Christmas Specials were four one-off specials produced for &lt;a href=\"Thames%20Television\"&gt;Thames Television&lt;/a&gt; made in 1969, 1970, 1972 and 1973. They brought most of the cast and the formula of the &lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20%28franchise%29\"&gt;\"Carry On\" films&lt;/a&gt; to a television production. Barbara Windsor was the only one to appear in all four \"Carry On Christmas\" specials. &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Williams\"&gt;Kenneth Williams&lt;/a&gt; (who appeared in twenty-six \"Carry On\" films, the most of any of the \"Carry On\" stars) did not appear in any of the Christmas specials.\nCarry on Christmas (1969).\nDescription.\nThe first special, \"Carry On Christmas\", was broadcast in 1969. It was filmed shortly after the completion of \"&lt;a href=\"Carry%20on%20Up%20the%20Jungle\"&gt;Carry on Up the Jungle&lt;/a&gt;\" and featured the same main cast from that film. It was scripted by long-term \"Carry On\" author &lt;a href=\"Talbot%20Rothwell\"&gt;Talbot Rothwell&lt;/a&gt;. The story was an irreverent take on &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Dickens\"&gt;Charles Dickens&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Christmas%20Carol\"&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/a&gt;\", featuring Sid James as &lt;a href=\"Ebenezer%20Scrooge\"&gt;Scrooge&lt;/a&gt;. The 'Christmas Past' sequence reveals that Scrooge failed to invest in the schemes of &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Frankenstein\"&gt;Dr. Frank N. Stein&lt;/a&gt;, who (assisted by his servant, &lt;a href=\"Count%20Dracula\"&gt;Count Dracula&lt;/a&gt;) sought to create a mate for &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Windsor\"&gt;Barbara Windsor&lt;/a&gt;'s Monster. The 'Christmas Present' sequence described &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Browning\"&gt;Robert Browning&lt;/a&gt;'s difficulties in attempting to elope with &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Barrett\"&gt;Elizabeth Barrett&lt;/a&gt; without funds, thanks to Scrooge's unwillingness to lend. The 'Christmas Future' sequence retold the story of &lt;a href=\"Cinderella\"&gt;Cinderella&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarry on Again Christmas (1970).\nDescription.\nThe second special, \"Carry On Again Christmas\", was shown the following year. Rothwell did not script this episode, but &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Colin\"&gt;Sid Colin&lt;/a&gt;, who had co-written \"&lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20Spying\"&gt;Carry On Spying&lt;/a&gt;\" with Rothwell, wrote the episode with &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Freeman%20%28British%20writer%29\"&gt;Dave Freeman&lt;/a&gt;, who would go on to script \"&lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20Behind\"&gt;Carry On Behind&lt;/a&gt;\", several episodes of the \"&lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20Laughing\"&gt;Carry On Laughing&lt;/a&gt;\" television series, and was the co-writer of the 1992 &lt;a href=\"film\"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20Columbus\"&gt;Carry On Columbus&lt;/a&gt;\". Based on the &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson\"&gt;Robert Louis Stevenson&lt;/a&gt; story \"&lt;a href=\"Treasure%20Island\"&gt;Treasure Island&lt;/a&gt;\", this episode saw the \"Carry on\" debut of &lt;a href=\"Wendy%20Richard\"&gt;Wendy Richard&lt;/a&gt;, who would go on to have small roles in \"&lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20Matron\"&gt;Carry On Matron&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20Girls\"&gt;Carry On Girls&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAlthough the 1969 special was broadcast in colour, the 1970 special was shown in black and white due to a technicians' &lt;a href=\"Strike%20action\"&gt;strike&lt;/a&gt;s that caused &lt;a href=\"Thames%20Television\"&gt;Thames Television&lt;/a&gt; to broadcast all their Christmas shows that year in black and white.\nCarry on Christmas (or Carry On Stuffing) (1972).\nDescription.\nIn 1972 a new Christmas special was produced, entitled \"Carry On Christmas (or Carry On Stuffing)\". Talbot Rothwell became ill whilst writing the script, and was unable to finish it. Dave Freeman had to be brought in to complete the script, but the two men did not work together. Charles Hawtrey pulled out of the special at short notice. Having taken third billing to Sid James and Terry Scott in the previous two shows, and knowing they would both be absent, Hawtrey demanded top billing. But \"Carry On\" producer &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Rogers\"&gt;Peter Rogers&lt;/a&gt; refused, giving top billing to Hattie Jacques instead. Hawtrey's role had hastily to be recast, and was split between &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Rossington\"&gt;Norman Rossington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Oulton\"&gt;Brian Oulton&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom had played cameo roles in several \"Carry On\" films. The special featured a collection of historical sketches, loosely linked around an 18th-century banquet.\nIt included a performance of two &lt;a href=\"madrigal%20%28music%29\"&gt;madrigal&lt;/a&gt;s originally written for \"&lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20Henry\"&gt;Carry On Henry&lt;/a&gt;\". The songs reappeared in the 1973 stage show \"&lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20%28film%20series%29%23Stage%20shows\"&gt;Carry On London&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCarry on Christmas (1973).\nDescription.\nFor the final original Christmas special, writer Talbot Rothwell returned, as did Sid James. In a modern-day setting, it features Sid James as a &lt;a href=\"department%20store\"&gt;department store&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Father%20Christmas\"&gt;Father Christmas&lt;/a&gt;, whose out-of-character behaviour puts him at odds with the store manager. James also introduces sketches set in Christmases past, and a \"Carry On\" ballet performance.\nCarry on Laughing's Christmas Classics (1983).\n&lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20Williams\"&gt;Kenneth Williams&lt;/a&gt; and Barbara Windsor introduce some of the funniest moments from the later &lt;a href=\"Carry%20On%20films\"&gt;Carry On films&lt;/a&gt;, in a format very similar to the film \"&lt;a href=\"That%27s%20Carry%20On%21\"&gt;That's Carry On!&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDVD release.\nIn 2005, the first four &lt;a href=\"Television%20special\"&gt;specials&lt;/a&gt; were released on &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt;, featuring &lt;a href=\"interview\"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"film%20producer\"&gt;film producer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Rogers\"&gt;Peter Rogers&lt;/a&gt; and stars &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Douglas%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Jack Douglas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wendy%20Richard\"&gt;Wendy Richard&lt;/a&gt;. \"Carry On Laughing's Christmas Classics\" has not been released on &lt;a href=\"home%20video\"&gt;home video&lt;/a&gt;."
