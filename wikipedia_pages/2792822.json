As with all volumes of \"Special Herbs\" released by Metal Fingers, each track is named after a &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt; or similar &lt;a href=\"flora%20%28plants%29\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of \"Untitled (Meditation)\").\nAlthough an instrumental album, some tracks contain sampled speech, such as \"Food... we need food!\" in \"Vervain\" and \"Peach fuzz!\" in \"Peach Extract\". The track \"Coca Leaf\" is made up of vocal samples of singing women."
