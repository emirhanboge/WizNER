    "text": "Norte Chico (also known as Caral or Caral-Supe) was a complex &lt;a href=\"pre-Columbian%20era\"&gt;pre-Columbian-era&lt;/a&gt; society that included as many as thirty major population centers in what is now the Caral region of north-central coastal &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;. The civilization flourished between the fourth and second millennia BC, with the formation of the first city generally dated to around 3500 BC, at &lt;a href=\"Huaricanga\"&gt;Huaricanga&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Fortaleza%20River%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;Fortaleza&lt;/a&gt; area. It is from 3100 BC onward that large-scale human settlement and communal construction become clearly apparent, which lasted until a period of decline around 1800 BC. Since the early twenty-first century, it has been established as the &lt;a href=\"Cradle%20of%20civilization\"&gt;oldest-known civilization&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Americas\"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis civilization flourished along three rivers, the &lt;a href=\"Fortaleza%20River%20%28Peru%29\"&gt;Fortaleza&lt;/a&gt;, the Pativilca, and the Supe. These river valleys each have large clusters of sites. Farther south, there are several associated sites along the Huaura River. The alternative name, Caral-Supe, is derived from the city of &lt;a href=\"Caral\"&gt;Caral&lt;/a&gt; in the Supe Valley, a large and well-studied Caral-Supe site. \nComplex society in Caral-Supe arose a millennium after &lt;a href=\"Sumer\"&gt;Sumer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt;, was contemporaneous with the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20pyramids\"&gt;Egyptian pyramids&lt;/a&gt;, and predated the &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerica\"&gt;Mesoamerica&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Olmec\"&gt;Olmec&lt;/a&gt; by nearly two millennia.\nIn &lt;a href=\"archaeological\"&gt;archaeological&lt;/a&gt; nomenclature, Caral-Supe is a pre-ceramic culture of the pre-Columbian &lt;a href=\"Periodization%20of%20pre-Columbian%20Peru\"&gt;Late Archaic&lt;/a&gt;; it &lt;a href=\"Andean%20preceramic\"&gt;completely lacked&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ceramic\"&gt;ceramic&lt;/a&gt;s and apparently had almost no visual art. The most impressive achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large &lt;a href=\"Earthworks%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;earthwork&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"platform%20mound\"&gt;platform mound&lt;/a&gt;s and sunken circular &lt;a href=\"plaza\"&gt;plaza&lt;/a&gt;s. Archaeological evidence suggests use of &lt;a href=\"textile\"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt; technology and, possibly, the worship of common deity symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian &lt;a href=\"Andes\"&gt;Andean&lt;/a&gt; cultures. Sophisticated government is presumed to have been required to manage the ancient &lt;a href=\"Caral\"&gt;Caral&lt;/a&gt;. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics.\nArchaeologists have been aware of ancient sites in the area since at least the 1940s; early work occurred at &lt;a href=\"Aspero\"&gt;Aspero&lt;/a&gt; on the coast, a site identified as early as 1905, and later at Caral, farther inland. In the late 1990s, Peruvian archaeologists, led by &lt;a href=\"Ruth%20Shady\"&gt;Ruth Shady&lt;/a&gt;, provided the first extensive documentation of the civilization with work at Caral. A 2001 paper in \"&lt;a href=\"Science%20%28journal%29\"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;\", providing a survey of the Caral research, and a 2004 article in \"&lt;a href=\"Nature%20%28journal%29\"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;\", describing fieldwork and &lt;a href=\"radiocarbon%20dating\"&gt;radiocarbon dating&lt;/a&gt; across a wider area, revealed Caral-Supe's full significance and led to widespread interest.\nHistory and geography.\nThe dating of the Caral-Supe sites has pushed back the estimated beginning date of complex societies in the Peruvian region by more than one thousand years. The &lt;a href=\"Chav%C3%ADn%20culture\"&gt;Chav\u00edn culture&lt;/a&gt;, circa 900 BC, had previously been considered the first civilization of the area. Regularly, it still is cited incorrectly as such in general works.\nThe discovery of Caral-Supe also has shifted the focus of research away from the &lt;a href=\"highland\"&gt;highland&lt;/a&gt; areas of the Andes and lowlands adjacent to the mountains (where the Chav\u00edn, and later &lt;a href=\"Inca\"&gt;Inca&lt;/a&gt;, had their major centers) to the Peruvian &lt;a href=\"Littoral%20zone\"&gt;littoral&lt;/a&gt;, or coastal regions. Caral is located in a north-central area of the coast, approximately 150 to 200 &lt;a href=\"km\"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Lima\"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt;, roughly bounded by the &lt;a href=\"Lur%C3%ADn%20Valley\"&gt;Lur\u00edn Valley&lt;/a&gt; on the south and the &lt;a href=\"Casma%20Valley\"&gt;Casma Valley&lt;/a&gt; on the north. It comprises four coastal valleys: the &lt;a href=\"Huaura%20Valley\"&gt;Huaura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Supe%20Valley\"&gt;Supe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pativilca%20Valley\"&gt;Pativilca&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fortaleza%20Valley\"&gt;Fortaleza&lt;/a&gt;. Known sites are concentrated in the latter three, which share a common coastal plain. The three principal valleys cover only 1,800\u00a0km\u00b2, and research has emphasized the density of the population centers.\nThe Peruvian littoral appears an \"improbable, even aberrant\" candidate for the \"pristine\" development of civilization, compared to other world centers. It is extremely arid, bounded by two &lt;a href=\"rain%20shadow\"&gt;rain shadow&lt;/a&gt;s (caused by the Andes to the east, and the &lt;a href=\"Pacific\"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trade%20wind\"&gt;trade wind&lt;/a&gt;s to the west). The region is punctuated by more than 50 rivers that carry Andean snowmelt. The development of widespread &lt;a href=\"irrigation\"&gt;irrigation&lt;/a&gt; from these water sources is seen as decisive in the emergence of Caral-Supe; since all of the monumental architecture at various sites has been found close to irrigation channels.\nThe &lt;a href=\"radiocarbon%20dating\"&gt;radiocarbon work&lt;/a&gt; of Jonathan Haas \"et al.\", found that 10 of 95 samples taken in the Pativilca and Fortaleza areas dated from before 3500 BC. The oldest, dating from 9210 BC, provides \"limited indication\" of human settlement during the Pre-Columbian Early Archaic era. Two dates of 3700 BC are associated with communal architecture, but are likely to be anomalous. It is from 3200 BC onward that large-scale human settlement and communal construction are clearly apparent. Mann, in a survey of the literature in 2005, suggests \"sometime before 3200 BC, and possibly before 3500 BC\" as the beginning date of the Caral-Supe formative period. He notes that the earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at &lt;a href=\"Huaricanga\"&gt;Huaricanga&lt;/a&gt;, in the Fortaleza area of the north, based on Haas's dates.\nHaas's early-third-millennium dates suggest that the development of coastal and inland sites occurred in parallel. But, from 2500 to 2000 BC, during the period of greatest expansion, the population and development decisively shifted toward the inland sites. All development apparently occurred at large interior sites such as Caral, although they remained dependent on fish and shellfish from the coast. The peak in dates is in keeping with Shady's dates at Caral, which show habitation from 2627 BC to 2020 BC. That coastal and inland sites developed in tandem remains disputed, however (see next section).\nCirca 1800 BC, the Caral-Supe civilization began to decline, with more powerful centers appearing to the south and north along the coast, and to the east inside the belt of the Andes. The success of irrigation-based agriculture at Caral-Supe may have contributed to its being eclipsed. Anthropologist Professor Winifred Creamer of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Illinois%20University\"&gt;Northern Illinois University&lt;/a&gt; notes that \"when this civilization is in decline, we begin to find extensive canals farther north. People were moving to more fertile ground and taking their knowledge of irrigation with them\". It would be a thousand years before the rise of the next great Peruvian culture, the &lt;a href=\"Chav%C3%ADn%20culture\"&gt;Chav\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeographical links.\nCultural links with the highland areas have been noted by archaeologists. In particular, the links with the &lt;a href=\"Kotosh%20Religious%20Tradition\"&gt;Kotosh Religious Tradition&lt;/a&gt; have been suggested.\nNumerous architectural features found among the settlements of Supe, including subterranean circular courts, stepped pyramids and sequential platforms, as well as material remains and their cultural implications, excavated at Aspero and the valley sites we are digging (Caral, Chupacigarro, Lurihuasi, Miraya), are shared with other settlements of the area that participated in what is known as the Kotosh Religious Tradition. Most specific among these features include rooms with benches and hearths with subterranean ventilation ducts, wall niches, biconvex beads, and musical flutes.\nMaritime coast and agricultural interior.\nResearch into Caral-Supe continues, with many unsettled questions. Debate is ongoing regarding two related questions: the degree to which the flourishing of the Caral-Supe was based on maritime food resources, and the exact relationship this implies between the coastal and inland sites.\nConfirmed diet.\nA broad outline of the Caral-Supe diet has been suggested. At Caral, the edible &lt;a href=\"domestication\"&gt;domesticated plants&lt;/a&gt; noted by Shady are &lt;a href=\"Cucurbita\"&gt;squash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bean\"&gt;bean&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Pouteria%20lucuma\"&gt;l\u00facuma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"guava\"&gt;guava&lt;/a&gt;, pacay (\"&lt;a href=\"Inga%20feuilleei\"&gt;Inga feuilleei&lt;/a&gt;\"), and &lt;a href=\"sweet%20potato\"&gt;sweet potato&lt;/a&gt;. Haas \"et al.\" noted the same foods in their survey farther north, while adding &lt;a href=\"avocado\"&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canna%20%28plant%29\"&gt;achira&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, good evidence for maize also was documented by Haas et al. (see below).\nThere was also a significant &lt;a href=\"seafood\"&gt;seafood&lt;/a&gt; component at both coastal and inland sites. Shady notes that \"animal remains are almost exclusively marine\" at Caral, including &lt;a href=\"clam\"&gt;clam&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mussel\"&gt;mussel&lt;/a&gt;s, and large amounts of &lt;a href=\"anchovy\"&gt;anchovies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sardine\"&gt;sardine&lt;/a&gt;s. That the anchovy fish reached inland is clear, although Haas suggests that \"&lt;a href=\"shellfish\"&gt;shellfish&lt;/a&gt; [which would include clams and mussels], &lt;a href=\"marine%20mammal\"&gt;sea mammals&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"seaweed\"&gt;seaweed&lt;/a&gt; do not appear to have been significant portions of the diet in the inland, non-maritime sites\".\nTheory of a maritime foundation for Andean civilization.\nThe role of seafood in the Caral-Supe diet has aroused debate. Much early fieldwork was conducted in the region of Aspero on the coast, before the full scope and inter-connectedness of the several sites of the civilization were realized. In a 1973 paper, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20E.%20Moseley\"&gt;Michael E. Moseley&lt;/a&gt; contended that a maritime subsistence (seafood) economy had been the basis of the society and its remarkably early flourishing, a theory later elaborated as a \"maritime foundation of Andean civilization\" (MFAC). He confirmed a previously observed lack of ceramics at &lt;a href=\"Aspero\"&gt;Aspero&lt;/a&gt;, and he deduced that \"&lt;a href=\"hummock\"&gt;hummock&lt;/a&gt;s\" on the site constituted the remains of artificial &lt;a href=\"platform%20mounds\"&gt;platform mounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis thesis of a maritime foundation was contrary to the general scholarly consensus that the rise of civilization was based on intensive agriculture, particularly of at least one &lt;a href=\"cereal\"&gt;cereal&lt;/a&gt;. The production of agricultural surpluses had long been seen as essential in promoting population density and the emergence of complex society. Moseley's ideas would be debated and challenged (that maritime remains and their caloric contribution were overestimated, for example), but have been treated as plausible as late as 2005, when Mann conducted a summary of the literature.\nConcomitant to the maritime subsistence hypothesis was an implied dominance of sites immediately adjacent to the coast over other centers. This idea was shaken by the realization of the magnitude of Caral, an inland site. Supplemental to a 1997 article by Shady dating Caral, a 2001 \"&lt;a href=\"Science%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;\" news article emphasized the dominance of agriculture and also suggested that Caral was the oldest &lt;a href=\"urban%20center\"&gt;urban center&lt;/a&gt; in Peru (and the entire Americas). It rejected the idea that civilization might have begun adjacent to the coast and then moved inland. One archaeologist was quoted as suggesting that \"rather than coastal antecedents to monumental inland sites, what we have now are coastal satellite villages to monumental inland sites\".\nThese assertions were quickly challenged by Sandweiss and Moseley, who observed that Caral, although being the largest and most complex preceramic site, it is not the oldest. They admitted the importance of agriculture to industry and to augment diet, while broadly affirming \"the formative role of marine resources in early Andean civilization\". Scholars now agree that the inland sites did have significantly greater populations, and that there were \"so many more people along the four rivers than on the shore that they had to have been dominant\".\nThe remaining question is which of the areas developed first and created a template for subsequent development. Haas rejects suggestions that maritime development at sites immediately adjacent to the coast was initial, pointing to contemporaneous development based on his dating. Moseley remains convinced that coastal Aspero is the oldest site, and that its maritime subsistence served as a basis for the civilization.\nCotton and food sources.\nIt is likely that &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; (of the species \"&lt;a href=\"Gossypium%20barbadense\"&gt;Gossypium barbadense&lt;/a&gt;\") provided the basis of the dominance of inland over coastal (whether development was earlier, later, or contemporaneous). Although not edible, cotton was the most important product of irrigation in the Caral-Supe culture, vital to the production of &lt;a href=\"fishing%20net\"&gt;fishing net&lt;/a&gt;s (that in turn provided maritime resources) as well as to &lt;a href=\"textile\"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt;s and textile technology. Haas notes that \"control over cotton allows a ruling elite to provide the benefit of cloth for &lt;a href=\"clothing\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt;, bags, wraps, and adornment\". He is willing to admit to a mutual dependency dilemma: \"The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their &lt;a href=\"protein\"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fisherman\"&gt;fishermen&lt;/a&gt; needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish.\" Thus, identifying cotton as a vital resource produced in the inland does not by itself resolve the issue of whether the inland centers were a progenitor for those on the coast, or vice versa. Moseley argues that successful maritime centers would have moved inland to find cotton. The exact relationship between food resources and political organization remains unresolved.\nThe development of Caral-Supe is particularly remarkable for the apparent absence of an agricultural &lt;a href=\"staple%20food\"&gt;staple food&lt;/a&gt;. However, recent studies increasingly dispute this and point to &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; as a dietary backbone of this and later pre-Columbian civilizations. Moseley found a small number of maize cobs in 1973 at Aspero (also seen in site work in the 1940s and 1950s) but has since called the find \"problematic\". However, increasing evidence has emerged about the importance of maize in this period:\nSocial organization.\nGovernment.\nThe degree of centralized authority is difficult to ascertain, but architectural construction patterns are indicative, at least in certain places at certain times, of an elite population who wielded considerable power: while some of the monumental architecture was constructed incrementally, other buildings, such as the two main platform mounds at Caral, appear to have been constructed in one or two intense construction phases. As further evidence of centralized control, Haas points to remains of large stone &lt;a href=\"warehouse\"&gt;warehouse&lt;/a&gt;s found at Upaca, on the Pativilca, as emblematic of authorities able to control vital resources such as cotton.\nHaas suggests that the labour mobilization patterns revealed by the archaeological evidence, point to a unique emergence of human government, one of two alongside &lt;a href=\"Sumer\"&gt;Sumer&lt;/a&gt; (or three, if &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerica\"&gt;Mesoamerica&lt;/a&gt; is included as a separate case). While in other cases, the idea of government would have been borrowed or copied, in this small group, government was \"invented\". Other archaeologists have rejected such claims as hyperbolic.\nIn exploring the basis of possible government, Haas suggests three broad bases of power for early complex societies:\nHe finds the first two present in ancient Caral-Supe.\nEconomic.\nEconomic authority would have rested on the control of cotton, edible plants, and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas tentatively suggests that the scope of this economic power base may have extended widely: there are only two confirmed shore sites in the Caral-Supe (Aspero and Bandurria) and possibly two more, but cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up and down the Peruvian coast. It is possible that the major inland centers of Caral-Supe, were at the center of a broad regional trade network centered on these resources.\nCiting Shady, a 2005 article in \"&lt;a href=\"Discover%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Discover&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine suggests a rich and varied trade life: \"[Caral] exported its own products and those of Aspero to distant communities in exchange for exotic imports: \"&lt;a href=\"Spondylus\"&gt;Spondylus&lt;/a&gt;\" shells from the coast of &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;, rich &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Andes\"&gt;Andean highlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anadenanthera%20peregrina\"&gt;hallucinogenic snuff&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20basin\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.\" (Given the still limited extent of Caral-Supe research, such claims should be treated circumspectly.) Other reports on Shady's work indicate Caral traded with communities in the jungle farther inland and, possibly, with people from the mountains.\nIdeology.\nHaas postulates that ideological power exercised by leadership was based on apparent access to &lt;a href=\"deities\"&gt;deities&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"supernatural\"&gt;supernatural&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence regarding Caral-Supe religion is limited: in 2003, an image of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20God\"&gt;Staff God&lt;/a&gt;, a leering figure with a hood and fangs, was found on a &lt;a href=\"gourd\"&gt;gourd&lt;/a&gt; that dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of deities. As with much other research at Caral-Supe, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.\nMann postulates that the act of architectural construction and maintenance at Caral-Supe may have been a spiritual or religious experience: a process of communal exaltation and ceremony. Shady has called Caral \"the sacred city\" (\"la ciudad sagrada\") and reports that socio-economic and political focus was on the temples, which were periodically remodeled, with major burnt offerings associated with the remodeling.\nPhysical.\nHaas notes the absence of any suggestion of physical bases of power, that is, defensive construction, at Caral-Supe. There is no evidence of warfare \"of any kind or at any level during the &lt;a href=\"Andean%20preceramic\"&gt;Preceramic Period&lt;/a&gt;\". Mutilated bodies, burned buildings, and other tell-tale signs of violence are absent and settlement patterns are completely non-defensive. The evidence of the development of complex government in the absence of warfare contrasts markedly to archaeological theory, which suggests that human beings move away from kin-based groups to larger units resembling \"&lt;a href=\"Sovereign%20state\"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;\" for mutual defense of often scarce resources. In Caral-Supe, a vital resource was present: &lt;a href=\"arable%20land\"&gt;arable land&lt;/a&gt; generally, and the cotton crop specifically, but Mann noted that apparently, the move to greater complexity by the culture was not driven by the need for defense or warfare.\nSites and architecture.\nCaral-Supe sites are known for their density of large sites with immense architecture. Haas argues that the density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Caral-Supe may have been the most densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20China\"&gt;Northern China&lt;/a&gt;). The Supe, &lt;a href=\"Pativilca\"&gt;Pativilca&lt;/a&gt;, Fortaleza, and &lt;a href=\"Huaura%20River\"&gt;Huaura River&lt;/a&gt; valleys of Caral-Supe each have several related sites.\nEvidence from the ground-breaking work during 1973 at &lt;a href=\"Aspero\"&gt;Aspero&lt;/a&gt;, at the mouth of the Supe Valley, suggested a site of approximately . Surveying of the &lt;a href=\"midden\"&gt;midden&lt;/a&gt; suggested extensive prehistoric construction activity. Small-scale &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20%28agriculture%29\"&gt;terracing&lt;/a&gt; was noted, along with more sophisticated platform mound &lt;a href=\"masonry\"&gt;masonry&lt;/a&gt;. As many as eleven artificial mounds were estimated to exist at the site. Moseley calls these \"Corporate Labor Platforms\", given that their size, layout, and construction materials and techniques would have required an organized workforce.\nThe survey of the northern rivers found sites between ; between one and seven large &lt;a href=\"platform%20mound\"&gt;platform mound&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014rectangular, &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20%28building%29\"&gt;terraced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pyramid\"&gt;pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014were discovered, ranging in size from to more than . Shady notes that the central zone of Caral, with monumental architecture, covers an area of just greater than . Also, six platform mounds, numerous smaller mounds, two sunken circular plazas, and a variety of residential architecture were discovered at this site.\nThe monumental architecture was constructed with &lt;a href=\"quarry\"&gt;quarried&lt;/a&gt; stone and river cobbles. Using &lt;a href=\"Phragmites\"&gt;reed&lt;/a&gt; \"shicra-bags\", some of which have been preserved, laborers would have hauled the material to sites by hand. Roger Atwood of &lt;a href=\"Archaeology%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;\"Archaeology\"&lt;/a&gt; magazine describes the process:\nArmies of workers would gather a long, durable grass known as \"&lt;a href=\"shicra\"&gt;shicra&lt;/a&gt;\" in the highlands above the city, tie the grass strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the trenches behind each successive &lt;a href=\"retaining%20wall\"&gt;retaining wall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"step%20pyramid\"&gt;step pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s with the stone-filled bags.\nIn this way, the people of Norte Chico achieved formidable architectural success. The largest of the platforms mounds at Caral, the \"&lt;a href=\"Piramide%20Mayor\"&gt;Piramide Mayor&lt;/a&gt;\", measures and rises high. In its summation of the 2001 Shady paper, the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; suggests workers would have been \"paid or compelled\" to work on centralized projects of this sort, with dried &lt;a href=\"anchovy\"&gt;anchovies&lt;/a&gt; possibly serving as a form of currency. Mann points to \"ideology, charisma, and skilfully timed reinforcement\" from leaders.\nDevelopment and absent technologies.\nWhen compared to the common &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt;n models of the development of civilization, Caral-Supe's differences are striking. In Caral-Supe, a total lack of ceramics persists across the period. Crops were cooked by roasting. The lack of pottery was accompanied by a lack of archaeologically apparent art. In conversation with Mann, Alvaro Ruiz observes: \"In the Norte Chico we see almost no &lt;a href=\"visual%20art\"&gt;visual art&lt;/a&gt;s. No sculpture, no carving or bas-&lt;a href=\"relief\"&gt;relief&lt;/a&gt;, almost no painting or drawing\u2014the interiors are completely bare. What we do see are these huge mounds\u2014and textiles.\"\nWhile the absence of ceramics appears anomalous, Mann notes that the presence of textiles is intriguing. \"&lt;a href=\"Quipu\"&gt;Quipu&lt;/a&gt;\" (or khipu), string-based recording devices, have been found at Caral, suggesting a writing, or &lt;a href=\"proto-writing\"&gt;proto-writing&lt;/a&gt;, system at Caral-Supe. (The discovery was reported by Mann in \"Science\" in 2005, but has not been formally published or described by Shady.) The exact use of quipu in this and later Andean cultures has been widely debated. Originally, it was believed to be a simple &lt;a href=\"mnemonic\"&gt;mnemonic&lt;/a&gt; technique used to record numeric information, such as a count of items bought and sold. Evidence has emerged, however, that the quipu also may have recorded &lt;a href=\"Logogram\"&gt;logographic&lt;/a&gt; information in the same way writing does. Research has focused on the much larger sample of a few hundred quipu dating to Inca times. The Caral-Supe discovery remains singular and undeciphered.\nOther finds at Caral-Supe have proved suggestive. While visual arts appear absent, the people may have played instrumental music: thirty-two flutes, crafted from &lt;a href=\"pelican\"&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt; bone, have been discovered.\nThe oldest known depiction of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20God\"&gt;Staff God&lt;/a&gt; was found in 2003 on some broken gourd fragments in a burial site in the &lt;a href=\"Pativilca%20River\"&gt;Pativilca River&lt;/a&gt; valley and the gourd was carbon dated to 2250 BCE. While still fragmentary, such archaeological evidence corresponds to the patterns of later Andean civilization and may indicate that Caral-Supe served as a template. Along with the specific finds, Mann highlights \n\"the primacy of exchange over a wide area, the penchant for collective, festive civic work projects, [and] the high valuation of textiles and textile technology\" within Norte Chico as patterns that would recur later in the Peruvian cradle of civilization.\"\nResearch.\nThe magnitude of the Caral-Supe discovery has generated academic controversy among researchers. The \"monumental feud\", as described by \"&lt;a href=\"Archaeology%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt;\", has included \"public insults, a charge of plagiarism, ethics inquiries in both Peru and the United States, and complaints by Peruvian officials to the U.S. government\". The lead author of the seminal paper of April 2001 was a Peruvian, &lt;a href=\"Ruth%20Shady\"&gt;Ruth Shady&lt;/a&gt;, with co-authors Jonathan Haas and Winifred Creamer, a married United States team; the coauthoring was reportedly suggested by Haas, in the hopes that the involvement of United States researchers would help secure funds for carbon dating as well as future research funding. Later, Shady charged the couple with &lt;a href=\"plagiarism\"&gt;plagiarism&lt;/a&gt; and insufficient attribution, suggesting the pair had received credit for her research, which had begun in 1994.\nAt issue is credit for the discovery of the civilization, naming it, and developing the theoretical models to explain it. That Shady was describing a civilization is clear in 1997 (\"Los albores de la civilizaci\u00f3n en el Per\u00fa\"). While locating it on the Supe River, with Caral at its center, she suggested a larger geographic base for the society: \nIn 2004, Haas \"et al.\" wrote that \"Our recent work in the neighboring Pativilca and Fortaleza has revealed that Caral and Aspero were but two of a much larger number of major Late Archaic sites in the Norte Chico\", while noting Shady only in footnotes. Attribution of this type is what has angered Shady and her supporters. Shady's position has been hampered by a lack of funding for archaeological research in her native Peru, as well as the media advantages of North American researchers in disputes of this type.\nHaas and Creamer were cleared of the plagiarism charge by their institutions. The science advisory council of the Chicago &lt;a href=\"Field%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History\"&gt;Field Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; rebuked Haas for press releases and web pages that gave too little credit to Shady and inflated the American couple's role as discoverers. As of 2005, the dispute remains heated. Scholars have concerns that it could make it more difficult for United States archaeologists to gain permission to work in Peru."
