As a Saracens youth player he received particular note for playing on against &lt;a href=\"Orrell%20R.U.F.C.\"&gt;Orrell R.U.F.C.&lt;/a&gt; despite multiple broken ribs.\nBotterman finished his professional rugby career in 2004, but remained involved in rugby with a 9 year stint as both player and part-time coach with Old Albanians. This stint would also include a game with the Barbarians against East Midlands, coming on as a replacement during a 48-17 victory.\nHis niece, &lt;a href=\"Hannah%20Botterman\"&gt;Hannah Botterman&lt;/a&gt; is a Saracens and England prop, starting for both aged 18 after being introduced to rugby aged 4 by her uncle and aunt (Jane Everett - also an English prop)."
