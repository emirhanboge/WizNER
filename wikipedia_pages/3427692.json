    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"Mathematical%20finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt;, the Vasicek model is a &lt;a href=\"mathematical%20model\"&gt;mathematical model&lt;/a&gt; describing the evolution of &lt;a href=\"interest%20rate\"&gt;interest rate&lt;/a&gt;s. It is a type of one-factor &lt;a href=\"short-rate%20model\"&gt;short-rate model&lt;/a&gt; as it describes interest rate movements as driven by only one source of &lt;a href=\"market%20risk\"&gt;market risk&lt;/a&gt;. The model can be used in the valuation of &lt;a href=\"interest%20rate%20derivative\"&gt;interest rate derivative&lt;/a&gt;s, and has also been adapted for credit markets. It was introduced in 1977 by &lt;a href=\"Old%C5%99ich%20Va%C5%A1%C3%AD%C4%8Dek\"&gt;Old\u0159ich Va\u0161\u00ed\u010dek&lt;/a&gt;, and can be also seen as a &lt;a href=\"stochastic%20investment%20model\"&gt;stochastic investment model&lt;/a&gt;.\nDetails.\nThe model specifies that the &lt;a href=\"force%20of%20interest\"&gt;instantaneous interest rate&lt;/a&gt; follows the &lt;a href=\"stochastic%20differential%20equation\"&gt;stochastic differential equation&lt;/a&gt;:\nwhere \"Wt\" is a &lt;a href=\"Wiener%20process\"&gt;Wiener process&lt;/a&gt; under the risk neutral framework modelling the random market risk factor, in that it models the continuous inflow of randomness into the system. The &lt;a href=\"standard%20deviation\"&gt;standard deviation&lt;/a&gt; parameter, formula_2, determines the &lt;a href=\"Volatility%20%28finance%29\"&gt;volatility&lt;/a&gt; of the interest rate and in a way characterizes the amplitude of the instantaneous randomness inflow. The typical parameters formula_3 and formula_2, together with the initial condition formula_5, completely characterize the dynamics, and can be quickly characterized as follows, assuming formula_6 to be non-negative:\nThe following derived quantity is also of interest,\nformula_6 and formula_2 tend to oppose each other: increasing formula_2 increases the amount of randomness entering the system, but at the same time increasing formula_6 amounts to increasing the speed at which the system will stabilize statistically around the long term mean formula_7 with a corridor of variance determined also by formula_6. This is clear when looking at the long term variance,\nwhich increases with formula_2 but decreases with formula_6.\nThis model is an &lt;a href=\"Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck%20process\"&gt;Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck stochastic process&lt;/a&gt;. Making the long term mean stochastic to another SDE is a simplified version of the cointelation SDE.\nDiscussion.\nVasicek's model was the first one to capture &lt;a href=\"Mean%20reversion%20%28finance%29\"&gt;mean reversion&lt;/a&gt;, an essential characteristic of the interest rate that sets it apart from other financial prices. Thus, as opposed to &lt;a href=\"common%20stock\"&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt; prices for instance, interest rates cannot rise indefinitely. This is because at very high levels they would hamper economic activity, prompting a decrease in interest rates. Similarly, interest rates do not usually decrease below 0. As a result, interest rates move in a limited range, showing a tendency to revert to a long run value.\nThe drift factor formula_25 represents the expected instantaneous change in the interest rate at time \"t\". The parameter \"b\" represents the &lt;a href=\"long-run\"&gt;long-run&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"steady%20state\"&gt;equilibrium&lt;/a&gt; value towards which the interest rate reverts. Indeed, in the absence of shocks (formula_26), the interest rate remains constant when \"rt = b\". The parameter \"a\", governing the speed of adjustment, needs to be positive to ensure &lt;a href=\"stability%20theory\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; around the long term value. For example, when \"rt\" is below \"b\", the drift term formula_25 becomes positive for positive \"a\", generating a tendency for the interest rate to move upwards (toward equilibrium).\nThe main disadvantage is that, under Vasicek's model, it is theoretically possible for the interest rate to become negative, an undesirable feature under pre-crisis assumptions. This shortcoming was fixed in the &lt;a href=\"Cox%E2%80%93Ingersoll%E2%80%93Ross%20model\"&gt;Cox\u2013Ingersoll\u2013Ross model&lt;/a&gt;, exponential Vasicek model, &lt;a href=\"Black%E2%80%93Derman%E2%80%93Toy%20model\"&gt;Black\u2013Derman\u2013Toy model&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%E2%80%93Karasinski%20model\"&gt;Black\u2013Karasinski model&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. The Vasicek model was further extended in the &lt;a href=\"Hull%E2%80%93White%20model\"&gt;Hull\u2013White model&lt;/a&gt;. The Vasicek model is also a canonical example of the &lt;a href=\"affine%20term%20structure%20model\"&gt;affine term structure model&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href=\"Cox%E2%80%93Ingersoll%E2%80%93Ross%20model\"&gt;Cox\u2013Ingersoll\u2013Ross model&lt;/a&gt;. In recent research both models were used for data partitioning and forecasting.\nAsymptotic mean and variance.\nWe solve the stochastic differential equation to obtain\nUsing similar techniques as applied to the &lt;a href=\"Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck%20process\"&gt;Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck&lt;/a&gt; stochastic process we get that state variable is distributed normally with mean\nand variance\nConsequently, we have\nand"
