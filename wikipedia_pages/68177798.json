The statue stands on a &lt;a href=\"plinth\"&gt;plinth&lt;/a&gt; that bears the inscription \"ROBERT THE BRUCE \nKING OF SCOTS 1306-1329\". It is located near the site of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bannockburn\"&gt;Battle of Bannockburn&lt;/a&gt;. The statue is a &lt;a href=\"Listed%20buildings%20in%20Scotland\"&gt;A listed building&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe statue was commissioned by the &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Bruce%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Elgin\"&gt;Earl of Elgin&lt;/a&gt; in 1964 to commemorate the 650th anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bannockburn\"&gt;Battle of Bannockburn&lt;/a&gt;. It was sculpted by &lt;a href=\"Pilkington%20Jackson\"&gt;Pilkington Jackson&lt;/a&gt; using the measurements of Bruce's skull, re-discovered at &lt;a href=\"Dunfermline%20Abbey\"&gt;Dunfermline Abbey&lt;/a&gt; in 1818. The statue was unveiled by &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;the Queen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1966, a replica of the statue was placed outside the &lt;a href=\"Alberta%20University%20of%20the%20Arts\"&gt;Alberta University of the Arts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Calgary\"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alberta\"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. The statue was funded by Canadian lawyer &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Harvie\"&gt;Eric Harvie&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 2009 to 2020, the statue featured on the &lt;a href=\"Clydesdale%20Bank%20%C2%A320%20note\"&gt;Clydesdale Bank \u00a320 note&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2013, the statue was restored in preparation for the 700th anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bannockburn\"&gt;Battle of Bannockburn&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. The statue which was cast in bronze was slowly turning &lt;a href=\"Verdigris\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20Secretary%20for%20Economy%2C%20Fair%20Work%20and%20Culture\"&gt;Culture secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fiona%20Hyslop\"&gt;Fiona Hyslop&lt;/a&gt; said \"The Robert the Bruce statue is an iconic part of the Bannockburn site, and a poignant reminder of the battle\".\nOn 11 June 2020, following the &lt;a href=\"actions%20against%20memorials%20in%20Great%20Britain%20during%20the%20George%20Floyd%20protests\"&gt;actions against memorials in Great Britain during the George Floyd protests&lt;/a&gt;, the statue was defaced with graffiti. The Scottish king was branded as a racist, despite not being involved in the &lt;a href=\"slave%20trade\"&gt;slave trade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Stirling&lt;/a&gt; MP &lt;a href=\"Alyn%20Smith\"&gt;Alyn Smith&lt;/a&gt; said \u201cI\u2019ve been vocal in my support of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Lives%20Matter\"&gt;#BlackLivesMatter&lt;/a&gt; and hope such counterproductive stupidity is an isolated incident.\u201d"
