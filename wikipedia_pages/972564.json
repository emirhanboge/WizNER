    "text": "The British National Vegetation Classification or NVC is a system of classifying &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;natural&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"habitat%20%28ecology%29\"&gt;habitat&lt;/a&gt; types in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; according to the &lt;a href=\"vegetation\"&gt;vegetation&lt;/a&gt; they contain.\nA large scientific meeting of &lt;a href=\"ecologist\"&gt;ecologist&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"botanist\"&gt;botanist&lt;/a&gt;s, and other related professionals in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; resulted in the publication of a compendium of five books: \"&lt;a href=\"British%20Plant%20Communities\"&gt;British Plant Communities&lt;/a&gt;\", edited by &lt;a href=\"John%20S.%20Rodwell\"&gt;John S. Rodwell&lt;/a&gt;, which detail the incidence of plant species in twelve major habitat types in the British &lt;a href=\"natural%20environment\"&gt;natural environment&lt;/a&gt;. They are the first systematic and comprehensive account of the &lt;a href=\"vegetation\"&gt;vegetation&lt;/a&gt; types of the country. They cover all natural, semi-natural and major artificial habitats in Great Britain (not &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;) and represent fifteen years of research by leading plant &lt;a href=\"ecology\"&gt;ecologists&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the data collated from the books, commercial &lt;a href=\"software\"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; products have been developed to help to classify vegetation identified into one of the many habitat types found in Great Britain \u2013 these include \"MATCH\", \"TABLEFIT\" and \"MAVIS\".\nTerminology used in connection with the British National Vegetation Classification.\nThe following is a list of terms used in connection with the British National Vegetation Classification, together with their meanings:\nConstant species.\nFor a list of the constant species, and the NVC communities in which they are present, see &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20constant%20species%20in%20the%20British%20National%20Vegetation%20Classification\"&gt;List of constant species in the British National Vegetation Classification&lt;/a&gt;.\nRare species.\nFor a list of these rare species, and the NVC communities in which they are present, see &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20rare%20species%20in%20the%20British%20National%20Vegetation%20Classification\"&gt;List of rare species in the British National Vegetation Classification&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommunities by category.\nIn total there are 286 communities in the British National Vegetation Classification. They are grouped into the following major categories:\nA full list of these communities, grouped into the above categories, can be found at &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20plant%20communities%20in%20the%20British%20National%20Vegetation%20Classification\"&gt;List of plant communities in the British National Vegetation Classification&lt;/a&gt;."
