    "text": "Enver Halil Hoxha ( , ; 16 October 190811 April 1985) was an &lt;a href=\"Albanians\"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; politician. He was &lt;a href=\"Secretary%20%28title%29%23First%20secretary\"&gt;First Secretary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Party%20of%20Labour%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Party of Labour of Albania&lt;/a&gt; from 1941 until his death in 1985. He was also a member of the &lt;a href=\"Politburo%20of%20the%20Party%20of%20Labour%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Front%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Democratic Front of Albania&lt;/a&gt;, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces from 1944 until his death. He was the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Albania\"&gt;22nd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Prime Minister of Albania&lt;/a&gt; from 1944 to 1954 and at various times was both foreign minister and &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Albania%29\"&gt;defence minister&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Albania\"&gt;People's Socialist Republic of Albania&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoxha was born in &lt;a href=\"Gjirokast%C3%ABr\"&gt;Gjirokast\u00ebr&lt;/a&gt; in 1908 and became a grammar school teacher in 1936. Following the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20invasion%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Italian invasion of Albania&lt;/a&gt;, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Party%20of%20Labour%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Party of Labour of Albania&lt;/a&gt; at its creation in 1941 in the Soviet Union. He was elected First Secretary in March 1943 at the age of 34. Less than two years after &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20Day%20%28Albania%29\"&gt;the liberation of the country&lt;/a&gt;, the monarchy of &lt;a href=\"Zog%20I%20of%20Albania\"&gt;King Zog&lt;/a&gt; was formally abolished, and Hoxha rose to power as Albania's symbolic head of state.\nDuring his 40-year rule, he rebuilt the country, which was left in ruins after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, building Albania's first railway line, raising the adult literacy rate from 5% to more than 90%, wiping out epidemics, electrifying the country and leading Albania towards agricultural independence. He also outlawed religion, travelling abroad, and private proprietorship, closed or converted to secular uses all of Albania's religious facilities. Under his regime, thousands of perceived dissidents were executed, and tens of thousands more were imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Forced%20labour%20camps%20in%20Communist%20Albania\"&gt;forced labour camps&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoxha's government was characterised by his proclaimed firm adherence to &lt;a href=\"anti-revisionist\"&gt;anti-revisionist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism\"&gt;Marxism\u2013Leninism&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. &lt;a href=\"Stalinism\"&gt;Stalinism&lt;/a&gt;, from the mid/late-1970s onwards. After his &lt;a href=\"Sino-Albanian%20split\"&gt;break&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Maoism\"&gt;Maoism&lt;/a&gt; in the 1976\u20131978 period, numerous Maoist parties around the world declared themselves &lt;a href=\"Hoxhaist\"&gt;Hoxhaist&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"International%20Conference%20of%20Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist%20Parties%20and%20Organizations%20%28Unity%20%26amp%3B%20Struggle%29\"&gt;International Conference of Marxist\u2013Leninist Parties and Organisations (Unity &amp; Struggle)&lt;/a&gt; is the best-known association of these parties.\nEarly life.\nHoxha was born in &lt;a href=\"Gjirokast%C3%ABr\"&gt;Gjirokast\u00ebr&lt;/a&gt; in southern Albania (then a part of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;), the son of Halil Hoxha, a &lt;a href=\"Islam%20in%20Albania\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tosks\"&gt;Tosk&lt;/a&gt; cloth merchant who travelled widely across Europe and the US, and Gjylihan (Gjylo) Hoxha n\u00e9e \"\u00c7u\u00e7i\". His surname Hoxha, in &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; \"hoca\" (pronounced hodja), means \"Master\" or a \"Teacher\" and is the most common one in Albania. It is derived from the noun \"&lt;a href=\"khawaja\"&gt;khawaja&lt;/a&gt;\" which when used specifically in the Albanian language refers to a Muslim priest, given that some of his paternal ancestors have likely been the members of the &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; clergy (&lt;a href=\"ulema\"&gt;ulema&lt;/a&gt;). He was named by his father after the renowned Ottoman military officer and member of the Young Turks, &lt;a href=\"Enver%20Pasha\"&gt;Enver Pasha&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hoxha family originated from the village of &lt;a href=\"Dropull\"&gt;Dropull&lt;/a&gt; and was attached to the &lt;a href=\"Bektashi%20Order\"&gt;Bektashi Order&lt;/a&gt;. In 1916 his father brought him to seek the blessing of Baba Selim of the &lt;a href=\"Zall%20Teqe\"&gt;Zall Teqe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter elementary school, he followed his studies in the city senior high school \"Liria\". He started his studies at the Gjirokast\u00ebr Lyceum in 1923. After the lyceum was closed, due to intervention of &lt;a href=\"Ekrem%20Libohova\"&gt;Ekrem Libohova&lt;/a&gt; Hoxha was awarded a state scholarship for the continuation of his studies in &lt;a href=\"Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB\"&gt;Kor\u00e7\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, at the French language &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20National%20Lyceum\"&gt;Albanian National Lyceum&lt;/a&gt; until 1930.\nIn 1930, Hoxha went to study at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Montpellier\"&gt;University of Montpellier&lt;/a&gt; in France on a state scholarship for the faculty of &lt;a href=\"natural%20science\"&gt;natural science&lt;/a&gt;, but lost an Albanian state scholarship for neglecting his studies. He later went to Paris, where he presented himself to anti-Zogist immigrants as the brother-in-law of &lt;a href=\"Bahri%20Omari\"&gt;Bahri Omari&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1935 to 1936, he was employed as a secretary at the Albanian consulate in &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. After returning to Albania, he worked as a contract teacher in the Gymnasium of &lt;a href=\"Tirana\"&gt;Tirana&lt;/a&gt;. Hoxha taught French and morals in the Kor\u00e7a Liceum from 1937 to 1939 and also served as the caretaker of the school library.\nOn 7 April 1939, Albania was &lt;a href=\"Italian%20invasion%20of%20Albania\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy%23Fascist%20regime%20.281922.E2.80.931943.29\"&gt;Fascist Italy&lt;/a&gt;. The Italians established a puppet government, the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281939%E2%80%9343%29\"&gt;Albanian Kingdom (1939\u201343)&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;a href=\"Shefqet%20V%C3%ABrlaci\"&gt;Shefqet V\u00ebrlaci&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of 1939, he was transferred to the Gjirokastra Gymnasium, but he soon returned to Tirana. He was helped by his best friend, Esat Dishnica, who introduced Hoxha to Dishnica's cousin &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20Bi%C3%A7ak%C3%A7iu\"&gt;Ibrahim Bi\u00e7ak\u00e7iu&lt;/a&gt;. Hoxha started to sleep in Bi\u00e7ak\u00e7iu's tobacco factory \"Flora\", and after a while Dishnica opened a shop with the same name, where Hoxha began working. He was a sympathiser of Kor\u00e7a's Communist Group.\nPartisan life.\nOn 8 November 1941, the Communist Party of Albania (later renamed the &lt;a href=\"Party%20of%20Labour%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Party of Labour of Albania&lt;/a&gt; in 1948) was founded. Hoxha was chosen from the \"Kor\u00e7a group\" as a Muslim representative by the two &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslav&lt;/a&gt; envoys as one of the seven members of the provisional &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee\"&gt;Central Committee&lt;/a&gt;. The First Consultative Meeting of Activists of the Communist Party of Albania was held in Tirana from 8 to 11 April 1942, with Hoxha himself delivering the main report on 8 April 1942.\nIn July 1942, Hoxha wrote \"Call to the Albanian Peasantry\", issued in the name of the Communist Party of Albania. The call sought to enlist support in Albania for the war against the fascists. The peasants were encouraged to hoard their grain and refuse to pay taxes or livestock levies brought by the government. After the September 1942 Conference at &lt;a href=\"Pez%C3%AB\"&gt;Pez\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Liberation%20Movement%20%28Albania%29\"&gt;National Liberation Movement&lt;/a&gt; was founded with the purpose of uniting the &lt;a href=\"anti-fascism\"&gt;anti-fascist&lt;/a&gt; Albanians, regardless of ideology or class.\nBy March 1943, the first National Conference of the Communist Party elected Hoxha formally as First Secretary. During WWII, the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;'s role in Albania was negligible. On 10 July 1943, the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20resistance%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Albanian partisans&lt;/a&gt; were organised in regular units of companies, battalions and brigades and named the Albanian National Liberation Army. The organization received military support from the British intelligence service, &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Intelligence%20Service\"&gt;SOE&lt;/a&gt;. The General Headquarters was created, with &lt;a href=\"Spiro%20Moisiu\"&gt;Spiro Moisiu&lt;/a&gt; as the commander and Hoxha as political &lt;a href=\"commissar\"&gt;commissar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Partisans\"&gt;Yugoslav Partisans&lt;/a&gt; had a much more practical role, helping to plan attacks and exchanging supplies, but communication between them and the Albanians was limited and letters often arrived late, sometimes well after a plan had been agreed upon by the National Liberation Army without consultation from the Yugoslav partisans.\nWithin Albania, repeated attempts were made during the war to remedy the communications difficulties which faced partisan groups. In August 1943, a secret meeting, the &lt;a href=\"Mukje%20Conference\"&gt;Mukje Conference&lt;/a&gt;, was held between the anti-communist &lt;a href=\"Balli%20Komb%C3%ABtar\"&gt;Balli Komb\u00ebtar&lt;/a&gt; (National Front) and the Communist Party of Albania. The result of this was an agreement to:\nTo encourage the Balli Komb\u00ebtar to sign, the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Albania\"&gt;Greater Albania&lt;/a&gt; sections that included Kosovo (part of Yugoslavia) and &lt;a href=\"Cham%C3%ABria\"&gt;Cham\u00ebria&lt;/a&gt; were made part of the Agreement.\nDisagreement with Yugoslav communists.\nA problem developed when the Yugoslav Communists disagreed with the goal of a Greater Albania and asked the Communists in Albania to withdraw their agreement. According to Hoxha, &lt;a href=\"Josip%20Broz%20Tito\"&gt;Josip Broz Tito&lt;/a&gt; had not agreed that \"Kosovo was Albanian\" and that &lt;a href=\"Serbs\"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt; opposition made the transfer an unwise option. After the Albanian Communists repudiated the Greater Albania agreement, the Balli Komb\u00ebtar condemned the Communists, who in turn accused the Balli Komb\u00ebtar of siding with the Italians. The Balli Komb\u00ebtar, however, lacked support from the people. After judging the Communists as an immediate threat, the Balli Komb\u00ebtar sided with &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;, fatally damaging its image among those fighting the Fascists. The Communists quickly added to their ranks many of those disillusioned with the Balli Komb\u00ebtar and took centre stage in the fight for liberation.\nThe Permet National Congress held during that time called for a \"new democratic Albania for the people\". Although the monarchy was not formally abolished, &lt;a href=\"Zog%20I%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Zog I of Albania&lt;/a&gt; was barred from returning to the country, which further increased the Communists' control. The Anti-Fascist Committee for National Liberation was founded, chaired by Hoxha. On 22 October 1944, the Committee became the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Government%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Democratic Government of Albania&lt;/a&gt; after a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Berat\"&gt;Berat&lt;/a&gt; and Hoxha was chosen as interim Prime Minister. Tribunals were set up to try alleged war criminals who were designated \"&lt;a href=\"enemy%20of%20the%20people\"&gt;enemies of the people&lt;/a&gt;\" and were presided over by &lt;a href=\"Ko%C3%A7i%20Xoxe\"&gt;Ko\u00e7i Xoxe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter liberation on 29 November 1944, several Albanian partisan divisions crossed the border into German-occupied Yugoslavia, where they fought alongside Tito's partisans and the Soviet &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; in a joint campaign which succeeded in driving out the last pockets of German resistance. Marshal Tito, during a Yugoslavian conference in later years, thanked Hoxha for the assistance that the Albanian partisans had given during the War for National Liberation (\"Lufta Nacional\u00e7lirimtare\"). The &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Front%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Democratic Front&lt;/a&gt;, dominated by the Albanian Communist Party, succeeded the National Liberation Front in August 1945, and the &lt;a href=\"1945%20Albanian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;first post-war election&lt;/a&gt; was held on 2 December that year. The Front was the only legal political organisation allowed to stand in the elections, and the government reported that 93% of Albanians voted for it.\nOn 11 January 1946, Zog was officially deposed and Albania was proclaimed the People's Republic of Albania (renamed the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Albania\"&gt;People's Socialist Republic of Albania&lt;/a&gt; in 1976). As First Secretary of the party, Hoxha was \"de facto\" head of state and the most powerful man in the country.\nAlbanians celebrate their independence day on 28 November (which is the date on which they declared their independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912), while in the former People's Socialist Republic of Albania the national day was 29 November, the day the country was liberated from the Italians. Both days are currently national holidays.\nEarly leadership (1946\u20131965).\nHoxha declared himself a &lt;a href=\"Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist\"&gt;Marxist\u2013Leninist&lt;/a&gt; and strongly admired Soviet leader &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt;. \nDuring the period of 1945\u20131950, the government adopted policies and actions intended to consolidate power which included extrajudicial killings and executions that targeted and eliminated anti-communists. \nThe Agrarian Reform Law was passed in August 1945. It confiscated land from &lt;a href=\"beys\"&gt;beys&lt;/a&gt; and large landowners, giving it without compensation to peasants. 52% of all land was owned by large landowners before the law was passed; this declined to 16% after the law's passage. Illiteracy, which was 90\u201395% in rural areas in 1939, fell to 30% by 1950, and by 1985 it was equal to that of a Western country.\nBy 1949, the US and British intelligence organisations were working with the former King Zog and the mountain men of his personal guard. They recruited Albanian refugees and \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Egypt, Italy and Greece, trained them in Cyprus, Malta and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), and infiltrated them into Albania. &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Valuable\"&gt;Guerrilla units entered Albania in 1950 and 1952&lt;/a&gt;, but they were killed or captured by Albanian security forces. &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Philby\"&gt;Kim Philby&lt;/a&gt;, a Soviet double agent working as a liaison officer between &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Intelligence%20Service\"&gt;MI6&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Intelligence%20Agency\"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;, had leaked details of the infiltration plan to Moscow, and the security breach claimed the lives of about 300 infiltrators.\nOn 19 February 1951, a bombing occurred at the Soviet embassy in Tirana, after which 23 accused intellectuals were arrested and put in prison. One of them, &lt;a href=\"Jonuz%20Kaceli\"&gt;Jonuz Kaceli&lt;/a&gt;, was killed by Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Mehmet%20Shehu\"&gt;Mehmet Shehu&lt;/a&gt; during interrogation. Subsequently, the 22 others were &lt;a href=\"1951%20executions%20in%20Albania\"&gt;executed&lt;/a&gt; without trial under Hoxha's orders. They were later found to be innocent.\nThe &lt;a href=\"State%20University%20of%20Tirana\"&gt;State University of Tirana&lt;/a&gt; was established in 1957, which was the first of its kind in Albania. The medieval &lt;a href=\"Gjakmarrja\"&gt;Gjakmarrja&lt;/a&gt; (blood feud) was banned. &lt;a href=\"Malaria\"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt;, the most widespread disease, was successfully fought through advances in health care, the use of &lt;a href=\"DDT\"&gt;DDT&lt;/a&gt;, and through the draining of swampland. From 1965 to 1985, no cases of malaria were reported, whereas previously Albania had the greatest number of infected patients in Europe. No cases of &lt;a href=\"syphilis\"&gt;syphilis&lt;/a&gt; had been recorded for 30 years. In 1938 the number of physicians was 1.1 per 10,000 and there was only one hospital bed per 1,000 people. In 1950, while the number of physicians had not increased, there were four times as many hospital beds per head, and health expenditures had risen to 5% of the budget, up from 1% before the war.\nRelations with Yugoslavia.\nAt this point, relations with &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; had begun to change. The roots of the change began on 20 October 1944 at the Second Plenary Session of the Communist Party of Albania. The Session considered the problems that the post-independence Albanian government would face. However, the Yugoslav delegation led by Velimir Stoini\u0107 accused the party of \"sectarianism and opportunism\" and blamed Hoxha for these errors. He also stressed the view that the Yugoslav Communist partisans spearheaded the Albanian partisan movement.\nAnti-Yugoslav members of the Albanian Communist Party had begun to think that this was a plot by Tito who intended to destabilize the Party. &lt;a href=\"Ko%C3%A7i%20Xoxe\"&gt;Ko\u00e7i Xoxe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sejfulla%20Mal%C3%ABshova\"&gt;Sejfulla Mal\u00ebshova&lt;/a&gt; and others who supported Yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion. Tito's position on Albania was that it was too weak to stand on its own and that it would do better as a part of Yugoslavia. Hoxha alleged that Tito had made it his goal to get Albania into Yugoslavia, firstly by creating the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Aid in 1946. In time, Albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards Yugoslav interests, much like the Italian agreements with Albania under Zog that made the nation dependent upon Italy.\nThe first issue was that the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20lek\"&gt;Albanian lek&lt;/a&gt; became revalued in terms of the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20dinar\"&gt;Yugoslav dinar&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"customs%20union\"&gt;customs union&lt;/a&gt; was formed and Albania's economic plan was decided more by Yugoslavia. Albanian economists H. Banja and V. To\u00e7i stated that the relationship between Albania and Yugoslavia during this period was exploitative and that it constituted attempts by Yugoslavia to make the Albanian economy an \"appendage\" to the Yugoslav economy. Hoxha then began to accuse Yugoslavia of misconduct:\nStalin advised Hoxha that Yugoslavia was attempting to annex Albania: \"We did not know that the Yugoslavs, under the pretext of 'defending' your country against an attack from the Greek fascists, wanted to bring units of their army into the PRA [People's Republic of Albania]. They tried to do this in a very secretive manner. In reality, their aim in this direction was utterly hostile, for they intended to overturn the situation in Albania.\" By June 1947, the Central Committee of Yugoslavia began publicly condemning Hoxha, accusing him of taking an individualistic and anti-Marxist line. When Albania responded by making agreements with the Soviet Union to purchase a supply of agricultural machinery, Yugoslavia said that Albania could not enter into any agreements with other countries without Yugoslav approval.\n&lt;a href=\"Ko%C3%A7i%20Xoxe\"&gt;Ko\u00e7i Xoxe&lt;/a&gt; tried to stop Hoxha from improving relations with Bulgaria, reasoning that Albania would be more stable with one trading partner rather than with many. &lt;a href=\"Nako%20Spiru\"&gt;Nako Spiru&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-Yugoslav member of the Party, condemned Xoxe and vice versa. With no one coming to Spiru's defense, he viewed the situation as hopeless and feared that Yugoslav domination of his nation was imminent, which caused him to commit suicide in November.\nAt the Eighth Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party which lasted from 26 February to 8 March 1948, Xoxe was implicated in a plot to isolate Hoxha and consolidate his own power. He accused Hoxha of being responsible for the decline in relations with Yugoslavia and stated that a Soviet military mission should be expelled in favor of a Yugoslav counterpart. Hoxha managed to remain firm and his support had not declined. When Yugoslavia publicly broke with the Soviet Union, Hoxha's support base grew stronger. Then, on 1 July 1948, Tirana called on all Yugoslav technical advisors to leave the country and unilaterally declared all treaties and agreements between the two countries null and void. Xoxe was expelled from the party and on 13 June 1949, he was executed by hanging.\nRelations with the Soviet Union.\nAfter the break with Yugoslavia, Hoxha aligned himself with the Soviet Union. From 1948 to 1960, $200\u00a0million in Soviet aid was given to Albania for technical and infrastructural expansion. Albania was admitted to the &lt;a href=\"Comecon\"&gt;Comecon&lt;/a&gt; on 22 February 1949 and served as a pro-Soviet force on the &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic&lt;/a&gt;. A Soviet submarine base was built on the Albanian island of &lt;a href=\"Sazan\"&gt;Sazan&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Vlor%C3%AB\"&gt;Vlor\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, posing a hypotethical threat to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Sixth%20Fleet\"&gt;U.S. Sixth Fleet&lt;/a&gt; in the Mediterranean. Relations with the Soviet Union remained close until the death of Stalin in March 1953. It was followed by 14 days of national mourning in Albania \u2013 more than in the Soviet Union. Hoxha assembled the population of Tirana in the capital's largest square, featuring a Stalin statue, requested that they kneel take a 2,000-word oath of \"eternal fidelity\" and \"gratitude\" to their \"beloved father\" and \"great liberator.\"\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Nikita%20Khrushchev\"&gt;Nikita Khrushchev&lt;/a&gt;, Stalin's eventual successor, aid was reduced and Albania was encouraged to adopt Khrushchev's specialisation policy. Under it, Albania would develop its agricultural output in order to supply the Soviet Union and other &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt; countries while they would be developing products of their own, which would, in theory, strengthen the Warsaw Pact. However, this also meant that Albanian industrial development, which was stressed heavily by Hoxha, would be retarded.\nIn May\u2013June 1955, &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Bulganin\"&gt;Nikolai Bulganin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anastas%20Mikoyan\"&gt;Anastas Mikoyan&lt;/a&gt; visited Yugoslavia while Khrushchev renounced the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Communist bloc. Khrushchev also began making references to &lt;a href=\"Palmiro%20Togliatti\"&gt;Palmiro Togliatti&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Apolycentric\"&gt;polycentrism&lt;/a&gt; theory. Hoxha had not been consulted on this and was offended. Yugoslavia began asking for Hoxha to rehabilitate the image of &lt;a href=\"Ko%C3%A7i%20Xoxe\"&gt;Ko\u00e7i Xoxe&lt;/a&gt;, which Hoxha steadfastly rejected. In 1956 at the &lt;a href=\"Twentieth%20Party%20Congress\"&gt;Twentieth Party Congress&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Communist Party of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, Khrushchev &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Speech\"&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Stalin%27s%20cult%20of%20personality\"&gt;cult of personality&lt;/a&gt; that had been built up around &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt; and denounced his excesses. Khrushchev then announced the theory of &lt;a href=\"peaceful%20coexistence\"&gt;peaceful coexistence&lt;/a&gt;, which angered the Stalinist Hoxha greatly. The Institute of Marxist\u2013Leninist Studies, led by Hoxha's wife &lt;a href=\"Nexhmije%20Hoxha\"&gt;Nexhmije&lt;/a&gt;, quoted &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Lenin\"&gt;Vladimir Lenin&lt;/a&gt;: \"The fundamental principle of the foreign policy of a socialist country and of a Communist party is &lt;a href=\"proletarian%20internationalism\"&gt;proletarian internationalism&lt;/a&gt;; not peaceful coexistence.\" Hoxha now took a more active stand against perceived &lt;a href=\"Marxist%20revisionism\"&gt;revisionism&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnity within the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Party%20of%20Labour\"&gt;Albanian Party of Labour&lt;/a&gt; began to decline as well, with a special delegate meeting held in Tirana in April 1956, composed of 450 delegates and having unexpected results. The delegates \"criticized the conditions in the party, the negative attitude toward the masses, the absence of party and socialist democracy, the economic policy of the leadership, etc.\" while also calling for discussions on the cult of personality and the Twentieth Party Congress.\nMovement towards China and Maoism.\nIn 1956, Hoxha called for a resolution which would confirm the existing leadership of the Party. The resolution was accepted, and all of the delegates who had spoken against it were expelled from the party and imprisoned. Hoxha claimed that Yugoslavia had attempted to overthrow the leadership of Albania. This incident increased Hoxha's power, effectively making Khrushchev-style reforms impossible there. In the same year, Hoxha travelled to the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, then embroiled in the &lt;a href=\"Sino-Soviet%20split\"&gt;Sino-Soviet split&lt;/a&gt;, and met &lt;a href=\"Mao%20Zedong\"&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/a&gt;. Chinese aid to Albania rose sharply in the next two years.\nIn an effort to keep Albania in the Soviet sphere, increased Soviet aid was given but relations with the Soviet Union remained at the same level until 1960, when Khrushchev met &lt;a href=\"Sofoklis%20Venizelos\"&gt;Sofoklis Venizelos&lt;/a&gt;, a liberal Greek politician. Khrushchev sympathised with the concept of an autonomous Greek &lt;a href=\"North%20Epirus\"&gt;North Epirus&lt;/a&gt; and he hoped to use Greek claims to keep the Albanian leadership in line. Hoxha reacted by only sending &lt;a href=\"Hysni%20Kapo\"&gt;Hysni Kapo&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Albanian Political Bureau, to the Third Congress of the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Romanian Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bucharest\"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, an event Communist heads of state were normally expected to attend. As relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate in the course of the meeting, Khrushchev said:\nFriction with the Soviet Union.\nRelations with the Soviet Union declined rapidly. A &lt;a href=\"hardline\"&gt;hardline&lt;/a&gt; policy was adopted and the Soviets reduced grain shipments at a time when Albania needed them due to the possibility of a flood-induced famine. In July 1960, a plot to overthrow the Albanian government was discovered. It was to be organised by Soviet-trained Rear Admiral &lt;a href=\"Teme%20Sejko\"&gt;Teme Sejko&lt;/a&gt;. After this, two pro-Soviet members of the Party, &lt;a href=\"Liri%20Belishova\"&gt;Liri Belishova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ko%C3%A7o%20Tashko\"&gt;Ko\u00e7o Tashko&lt;/a&gt;, were expelled.\nIn August, the Party's Central Committee sent a protest to the Central Committee of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;CPSU&lt;/a&gt; about having an anti-Albanian Soviet Ambassador in Tirana. The Fourth Congress of the Party, held from 13 to 20 February 1961, was the last meeting that the Soviet Union or other Eastern European nations attended in Albania. During the congress, &lt;a href=\"Mehmet%20Shehu\"&gt;Mehmet Shehu&lt;/a&gt; stated that while many members of the Party were accused of &lt;a href=\"tyranny\"&gt;tyranny&lt;/a&gt;, this was a baseless charge and unlike the Soviet Union, Albania was led by genuine Marxists.\nThe Soviet Union retaliated by threatening \"dire consequences\" if the condemnations were not retracted. Days later, Khrushchev and &lt;a href=\"Anton%C3%ADn%20Novotn%C3%BD\"&gt;Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;President of Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;, threatened to cut off economic aid. In March, Albania was not invited to attend the meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt; nations, and in April all Soviet technicians were withdrawn from Albania. In May nearly all Soviet troops at the Soviet submarine base were withdrawn.\nOn 7 November 1961, Hoxha made a speech in which he called Khrushchev a \"revisionist, an anti-Marxist and a defeatist\". Hoxha portrayed Stalin as the last Communist leader of the Soviet Union and alluded to Albania's independence. By 11 November, the USSR and every other Warsaw Pact nation broke diplomatic relations with Albania. Albania was unofficially excluded from the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Comecon\"&gt;Comecon&lt;/a&gt;. The Soviet Union also attempted to claim control of the submarine base. The Albanian Party then passed a law prohibiting any other nation from owning an Albanian port. The &lt;a href=\"Soviet%E2%80%93Albanian%20split\"&gt;Soviet\u2013Albanian split&lt;/a&gt; was now complete.\nLater rule (1965\u20131985).\nAs Hoxha's leadership continued, he took on an increasingly &lt;a href=\"Theory\"&gt;theoretical&lt;/a&gt; stance. He wrote criticisms which were based on theory and current events which occurred at the time; his most notable criticisms were his condemnations of &lt;a href=\"Maoism\"&gt;Maoism&lt;/a&gt; after 1978. A major achievement under Hoxha was the advancement of &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20rights%20in%20Albania\"&gt;women's rights&lt;/a&gt;. Albania had been one of the most, if not the most, &lt;a href=\"patriarchal\"&gt;patriarchal&lt;/a&gt; countries in Europe. The ancient \"&lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Lek%C3%AB\"&gt;Code of Lek\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;\", which regulated the status of women, states, \"A woman is known as a sack, made to endure as long as she lives in her husband's house.\" Women were not allowed to inherit anything from their parents, and discrimination was even made in the case of the murder of a pregnant woman:\nWomen were forbidden from obtaining a divorce, and the wife's parents were obliged to return a runaway daughter to her husband or else suffer shame which could even result in a generations-long &lt;a href=\"blood%20feud\"&gt;blood feud&lt;/a&gt;. During World War II, the Albanian Communists encouraged women to join the partisans and following the war, women were encouraged to take up menial jobs, as the education necessary for higher level work was out of most women's reach. In 1938, 4% worked in various sectors of the economy. In 1970, this number had risen to 38%, and in 1982 to 46%.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20and%20Ideological%20Revolution\"&gt;Cultural and Ideological Revolution&lt;/a&gt; (discussed below), women were encouraged to take up \"all\" jobs, including government posts, which resulted in 40.7% of the People's Councils and 30.4% of the People's Assembly being made up of women, including two women in the Central Committee by 1985. In 1978, 15.1 times as many females attended eight-year schools as had done so in 1938 and 175.7 times as many females attended secondary schools. By 1978, 101.9 times as many women attended higher schools as in 1957. Hoxha said of women's rights in 1967:The entire party and country should hurl into the fire and break the neck of anyone who dared trample underfoot the sacred edict of the party on the defense of women's rights.In 1969, direct taxation was abolished and during this period the quality of schooling and health care continued to improve. An electrification campaign was begun in 1960 and the entire nation was expected to have electricity by 1985. Instead, it achieved this on 25 October 1970, making it the first nation with complete electrification in the world. During the Cultural &amp; Ideological Revolution of 1967\u20131968 the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20People%27s%20Army\"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; changed from traditional Communist army tactics and began to adhere to the &lt;a href=\"Maoist\"&gt;Maoist&lt;/a&gt; strategy known as &lt;a href=\"people%27s%20war\"&gt;people's war&lt;/a&gt;, which included the abolition of &lt;a href=\"military%20rank\"&gt;military rank&lt;/a&gt;s, which were not fully restored until 1991. Mehmet Shehu said of the country's health service in 1979:\nHoxha's legacy also included a &lt;a href=\"Bunkers%20in%20Albania\"&gt;complex of 173,371 one-man concrete bunkers&lt;/a&gt; across a country of 3 million inhabitants, to act as look-outs and gun emplacements along with &lt;a href=\"chemical%20weapon\"&gt;chemical weapon&lt;/a&gt;s. The bunkers were built strong and mobile, with the intention that they could be easily placed by a crane or a helicopter in a hole. The types of bunkers vary from machine gun pillboxes, beach bunkers, to underground naval facilities and even Air Force Mountain and underground bunkers.\nHoxha's internal policies were true to Stalin's paradigm which he admired, and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20personality\"&gt;personality cult&lt;/a&gt; which was developed in the 1970s and organised around him by the &lt;a href=\"Party%20of%20Labour%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Party&lt;/a&gt; also bore a striking resemblance to &lt;a href=\"Stalin%27s%20cult%20of%20personality\"&gt;that of Stalin&lt;/a&gt;. At times it even reached an intensity which was as extreme as the &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung%27s%20cult%20of%20personality\"&gt;personality cult&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung\"&gt;Kim Il-sung&lt;/a&gt; (which Hoxha condemned) with Hoxha being portrayed as a genius commenting on virtually all facets of life from culture to economics to military matters. Each schoolbook required one or more quotations from him on the subjects being studied. The Party honored him with titles such as Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and Great Teacher. He adopted a different type &lt;a href=\"military%20salute\"&gt;military salute&lt;/a&gt; for the People's Army to render honors which was known as the Hoxhaist Salute, which involves soldiers curling their right fist and raising it to shoulder level. It replaced the &lt;a href=\"Zogist%20salute\"&gt;Zogist salute&lt;/a&gt;, which was used by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Albanian%20Army\"&gt;Royal Albanian Army&lt;/a&gt; for many years.\nHoxha's governance was also distinguished by his encouragement of a high birthrate policy. For instance, a woman who bore an above-average number of children would be given the government award of \"Heroine Mother\" (in Albanian: \"N\u00ebn\u00eb Heroin\u00eb\") along with cash rewards. Abortion was essentially restricted (to encourage high birth rates), except if the birth posed a danger to the mother's life, though it was not completely banned; the process was decided by district medical commissions. As a result, the &lt;a href=\"Demographics%20of%20Albania\"&gt;population of Albania&lt;/a&gt; tripled from 1 million in 1944 to around 3\u00a0million in 1985.\nRelations with China.\nIn Albania's &lt;a href=\"Third%20Five-year%20Plan\"&gt;Third Five-year Plan&lt;/a&gt;, China promised a loan of $125\u00a0million to build twenty-five chemical, electrical and metallurgical plants in accordance to the Plan. However, the nation found difficulty doing so, as Albania's poor relations with its neighbours and the distance between the two nations complicated matters. Unlike Yugoslavia or the USSR, China had less economic influence on Albania during Hoxha's leadership. The previous fifteen years (1946\u20131961) had at least 50% of the economy under foreign commerce.\nBy the time the 1976 Constitution was promulgated, Albania had become mostly self-sufficient but lacked modern technology. Ideologically, Hoxha found Mao's initial views to be in line with &lt;a href=\"Marxism-Leninism\"&gt;Marxism-Leninism&lt;/a&gt;, due to his condemnation of &lt;a href=\"Nikita%20Khrushchev\"&gt;Nikita Khrushchev&lt;/a&gt;'s alleged &lt;a href=\"Marxist%20revisionism\"&gt;revisionism&lt;/a&gt; and Yugoslavia. Aid given from China was interest-free and it did not have to be repaid until Albania could afford to do so.\nChina never intervened in Albania's economic output, with Chinese technicians working for the same wages as Albanian workers. Albanian newspapers were reprinted in Chinese newspapers and read on Chinese radio, and Albania led the movement &lt;a href=\"China%20and%20the%20United%20Nations\"&gt;to give the People's Republic of China a seat&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Security%20Council\"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt;. During this period, Albania became the second largest producer of &lt;a href=\"chromium\"&gt;chromium&lt;/a&gt; in the world, which was considered important to the country. Strategically, the &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt; was attractive to China, as it was hoped that more allies could be gained in Eastern Europe through Albania - which failed. &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Enlai\"&gt;Zhou Enlai&lt;/a&gt; visited Albania in January 1964. On 9 January, \"The 1964 Sino-Albanian Joint Statement\" was signed in Tirana. The statement said of relations between socialist countries:\nLike Albania, China defended the \"purity\" of &lt;a href=\"Marxism\"&gt;Marxism&lt;/a&gt; by attacking both &lt;a href=\"American%20imperialism\"&gt;US imperialism&lt;/a&gt; and \"Soviet and Yugoslav revisionism\", both equally as part of a \"dual adversary\" theory. Yugoslavia was viewed as both a \"special detachment of U.S. imperialism\" and a \"saboteur against world revolution.\" These views, however, began to change in China, which was one of the major issues which Albania had with the alliance. Also unlike Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, the Sino-Albanian alliance lacked \"...\u00a0an organisational structure for regular consultations and policy coordination, and it was also characterized by an informal relationship which was conducted on an \"ad hoc\" basis.\" Mao made a speech on 3 November 1966 in which he claimed that Albania was the only &lt;a href=\"Marxist-Leninist\"&gt;Marxist-Leninist&lt;/a&gt; state in Europe and in the same speech, he also stated that \"an attack on Albania will have to reckon with great &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;. If the U.S. imperialists, the modern Soviet revisionists or any of their lackeys dare to touch Albania in the slightest, nothing lies ahead for them but a complete, shameful and memorable defeat.\" Hoxha likewise stated that \"You may rest assured, comrades, that come what may in the world at large, our two parties and our two peoples will certainly remain together. They will fight together and they will win together.\"\nShift in Chinese foreign policy after the Cultural Revolution.\nChina entered into a four-year period of relative diplomatic isolation following the &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20Revolution\"&gt;Cultural Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, at which point relations between China and Albania were generally mostly positive. On 20 August 1968, the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; was condemned by Albania, as was the &lt;a href=\"Brezhnev%20doctrine\"&gt;Brezhnev doctrine&lt;/a&gt;. Albania refused to send troops in support of the invasion, officially withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact on 5 September. Relations with China began to deteriorate on 15 July 1971, when United States President &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Nixon\"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; agreed to visit China to meet with &lt;a href=\"Zhou%20Enlai\"&gt;Zhou Enlai&lt;/a&gt;. Hoxha felt betrayed by this, with the Central Committee of the PLA sending a letter to the Central Committee of the CCP on 6 August calling Nixon a \"frenzied anti-Communist\". The letter stated:\nThe result of this criticism was a message from the Chinese leadership in 1971 stating that Albania could not depend on an indefinite flow of further Chinese aid, and in 1972 Albania was advised to \"curb its expectations about further Chinese contributions to its economic development\". By 1972, Hoxha wrote in his diary \"Reflections on China\" that China was no longer a socialist country:\nAnd in 1973, wrote that the Chinese leaders:\nIn response, trade with COMECON (although trade with the Soviet Union was still blocked) and Yugoslavia grew. Trade with Third World nations was $0.5\u00a0million in 1973, but $8.3\u00a0million in 1974. Trade rose from 0.1% to 1.6%. Following Mao's death on 9 September 1976, Hoxha remained optimistic about Sino-Albanian relations, but in August 1977, &lt;a href=\"Hua%20Guofeng\"&gt;Hua Guofeng&lt;/a&gt;, the new leader of China, stated that Mao's &lt;a href=\"Three%20Worlds%20Theory\"&gt;Three Worlds Theory&lt;/a&gt; would become official foreign policy. Hoxha viewed this as a way for China to justify having the U.S. as the \"secondary enemy\" while viewing the Soviet Union as the main one, thus allowing China to trade with the U.S. He stated that:\n From 30 August to 7 September 1977, Tito visited &lt;a href=\"Beijing\"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; and was welcomed by the Chinese leadership. Following this, the PLA declared that China was now a revisionist state akin to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and that Albania was the only Marxist\u2013Leninist state on Earth. Hoxha stated:\nOn 13 July 1978, China announced that it was cutting off all aid to Albania. For the first time in modern history, Albania did not have either an ally or a major trading partner.\nPolitical repressions and emigration.\nCertain clauses in the 1976 constitution circumscribed the exercise of political liberties which the government interpreted as contrary to the established order. The government denied the population access to information other than that disseminated by the government-controlled media. Internally, the &lt;a href=\"Sigurimi\"&gt;Sigurimi&lt;/a&gt; followed the repressive methods of the &lt;a href=\"NKVD\"&gt;NKVD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20for%20State%20Security%20%28Soviet%20Union%29\"&gt;MGB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"KGB\"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"German%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;East German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stasi\"&gt;Stasi&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, every third Albanian had either been interrogated by the Sigurimi or incarcerated in &lt;a href=\"Forced%20labor%20camps%20in%20Communist%20Albania\"&gt;labour camps&lt;/a&gt;. The government imprisoned thousands in forced-labour camps or executed them for crimes such as alleged treachery or for disrupting the &lt;a href=\"Dictatorship%20of%20the%20Proletariat\"&gt;proletarian dictatorship&lt;/a&gt;. After 1968, travel abroad was forbidden to all but those on official business. &lt;a href=\"Western%20culture\"&gt;Western European culture&lt;/a&gt; was looked upon with deep suspicion, resulting in bans on any unauthorised foreign material and arrests. Art was required to reflect the styles of &lt;a href=\"socialist%20realism\"&gt;socialist realism&lt;/a&gt;. Beards were banned as unhygienic in order to curb the influence of &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; (many &lt;a href=\"Imam\"&gt;Imam&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bektashi\"&gt;Babas&lt;/a&gt; had beards) and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; faith.\nThe justice system regularly degenerated into &lt;a href=\"show%20trial\"&gt;show trial&lt;/a&gt;s. An American &lt;a href=\"human%20rights\"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; group described the proceedings of one trial: In order to lessen the threat of political dissidents and other exiles, relatives of the accused were often arrested, &lt;a href=\"ostracised\"&gt;ostracised&lt;/a&gt;, and accused of being \"&lt;a href=\"enemies%20of%20the%20people\"&gt;enemies of the people&lt;/a&gt;\". Political executions were common, and at least 5,000 people\u2014possibly as many as 25,000\u2014were killed by the regime. &lt;a href=\"Torture\"&gt;Torture&lt;/a&gt; was often used to obtain confessions:\nDuring Hoxha's rule, there were six institutions for political prisoners and fourteen labour camps where political prisoners and common criminals worked together. It has been estimated that there were approximately 32,000 people imprisoned in Albania in 1985.\nArticle 47 of the Albanian Criminal Code stated that to \"escape outside the state, as well as refusal to return to the Fatherland by a person who has been sent to serve or has been permitted temporarily to go outside the state\" was an act of &lt;a href=\"treason\"&gt;treason&lt;/a&gt;, a crime punishable by a minimum sentence of ten years and a maximum sentence of death. The Albanian government went to great lengths to prevent people from defecting by leaving the country:An electrically-wired metal fence stands 600 meters to one kilometer from the actual border. Anyone touching the fence not only risks electrocution, but also sets off alarm bells and lights which alert guards stationed at approximately one-kilometre intervals along the fence. Two meters of soil on either side of the fence are cleared in order to check for footprints of escapees and infiltrators. The area between the fence and the actual border is seeded with booby traps such as coils of wire, noise makers consisting of thin pieces of metal strips on top of two wooden slats with stones in a tin container which rattle if stepped on, and flares that are triggered by contact, thus illuminating would-be escapees during the night.\nReligion.\nAlbania, the only predominantly Muslim country in Europe at that time, largely owing to Turkish influence in the region, had not, like the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, identified religion with ethnicity. In the Ottoman Empire, Muslims were viewed as Turks, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox Christians&lt;/a&gt; were viewed as Greeks, and &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt; were viewed as Latins. Hoxha believed that this division of Albanian society along religious and ethnic lines was a serious issue, because it fueled Greek separatists in southern Albania and it also divided the nation in general. The Agrarian Reform Law of 1945 confiscated much of the church's property in the country. Catholics were the earliest religious community to be targeted since the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; was seen as being an agent of &lt;a href=\"Fascism\"&gt;Fascism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anti-Communism\"&gt;anti-Communism&lt;/a&gt;. In 1946 the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Jesus\"&gt;Jesuit Order&lt;/a&gt; was banned and the &lt;a href=\"Franciscans\"&gt;Franciscans&lt;/a&gt; were banned in 1947. \"Decree No. 743\" (On religion) sought a &lt;a href=\"State%20religion\"&gt;national church&lt;/a&gt; and forbade religious leaders from associating with foreign powers.\n&lt;a href=\"Mother%20Teresa\"&gt;Mother Teresa&lt;/a&gt;, a Catholic nun whose family resided in Albania during Hoxha's rule, was denied a chance to see them because she was viewed as a dangerous agent of the Vatican. Despite multiple requests and the fact that many countries made requests on her behalf, she was not granted the opportunity to see her mother and sister. Both Mother Teresa's mother and sister died during Hoxha's rule, and the nun herself was only able to visit Albania five years after the Communist regime collapsed. Dom Lush Gjergji in his book \"Our Mother Teresa\" describes one of her trips to the embassy where she was crying as she was leaving the building, saying:Dear God, I can understand and accept that I should suffer, but it is so hard to understand and accept why my mother has to suffer. In her old age she has no other wish than to see us one last time. \nThe Party focused on atheist education in schools. This tactic was effective, primarily due to the high birthrate policy which was encouraged after the war. During what the religious consider \"holy periods\", such as &lt;a href=\"Lent\"&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ramadan\"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;, many foods and non-water beverages were distributed in schools and factories, and whoever refused to eat those foods or drink these beverages when offered during their \"fasting times\" were denounced.\nStarting on 6February 1967, the Party began to promote &lt;a href=\"secularism\"&gt;secularism&lt;/a&gt; in place of &lt;a href=\"Abrahamic%20religions\"&gt;Abrahamic religions&lt;/a&gt;. Hoxha, who had declared a \"&lt;a href=\"Cultural%20and%20Ideological%20Revolution\"&gt;Cultural and Ideological Revolution&lt;/a&gt;\" after being partly inspired by China's &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20Revolution\"&gt;Cultural Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, encouraged communist students and workers to use more forceful tactics to discourage religious practices, although violence was initially condemned.\nAccording to Hoxha, the surge in &lt;a href=\"Antitheism\"&gt;anti-theist&lt;/a&gt; activity began with the youth. The result of this \"spontaneous, unprovoked movement\" was the demolition or conversion of all 2,169 churches and mosques in Albania. &lt;a href=\"State%20atheism\"&gt;State atheism&lt;/a&gt; became official policy, and Albania was declared the world's first atheist state. Town and city names which echoed Abrahamic religious themes were abandoned for neutral secular ones, as well as personal names. By 1968, Hoxha stated in a speech in that \"Religion is a fuel kindling fires of all evils\". During this period religiously based names were also made illegal. The \"Dictionary of People's Names\", published in 1982, contained 3,000 approved, secular names. In 1992, Monsignor Dias, the Papal Nuncio for Albania appointed by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;, said that of the three hundred Catholic priests present in Albania prior to the Communists coming to power, only thirty were still active. Promotion of religion was banned and all clerics were outlawed as reactionaries. Those religious figures who refused to embrace the principles of &lt;a href=\"Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism\"&gt;Marxism\u2013Leninism&lt;/a&gt; were either arrested or carried on their activities in hiding.\nCultivating nationalism.\nEnver Hoxha had declared during the anti-religious campaign that \"the only religion of Albania is Albanianism\", a quotation from the poem \"O moj Shqiperi\" (\"O Albania\") by the 19th-century Albanian writer &lt;a href=\"Pashko%20Vasa\"&gt;Pashko Vasa&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Muzafer%20Korkuti\"&gt;Muzafer Korkuti&lt;/a&gt;, one of the dominant figures in post-war Albanian &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; and now Director of the Institute of Archaeology in Tirana, said this in an interview on 10 July 2002:\nEfforts were focused on an &lt;a href=\"Illyrians\"&gt;Illyrian&lt;/a&gt;-Albanian continuity issue.\nAn Illyrian origin of the Albanians (without denying \"&lt;a href=\"Pelasgian\"&gt;Pelasgian&lt;/a&gt;\" roots) continued to play a significant role in Albanian nationalism, resulting in a revival of given names supposedly of \"Illyrian\" origin, at the expense of given names associated with &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;. At first, Albanian nationalist writers opted for the Pelasgians as the forefathers of the Albanians, but as this form of nationalism flourished in Albania under Enver Hoxha, the Pelasgians became a secondary element to the Illyrian theory of &lt;a href=\"Origin%20of%20the%20Albanians\"&gt;Albanian origins&lt;/a&gt;, which could claim some support in scholarship.\nThe Illyrian descent theory soon became one of the pillars of Albanian nationalism, especially because it could provide some evidence of continuity of an Albanian presence both in &lt;a href=\"Kosovo\"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Albania\"&gt;Southern Albania&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. areas that were subject to &lt;a href=\"ethnic%20conflict\"&gt;ethnic conflict&lt;/a&gt;s between &lt;a href=\"Albanians\"&gt;Albanians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serbs\"&gt;Serbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greeks\"&gt;Greeks&lt;/a&gt;. Under the government of Enver Hoxha, an &lt;a href=\"Indigenism\"&gt;autochthonous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ethnogenesis\"&gt;ethnogenesis&lt;/a&gt; was promoted and physical anthropologists tried to demonstrate that Albanians were different from any other &lt;a href=\"Proto-Indo-Europeans\"&gt;Indo-European&lt;/a&gt; populations, a theory now disproved. They claimed that the Illyrians were the most ancient people in the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt; and greatly extended the age of the &lt;a href=\"Illyrian%20language\"&gt;Illyrian language&lt;/a&gt;.\nRejecting Western mass media culture.\nHoxha and his government were also hostile to &lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"popular%20culture\"&gt;popular culture&lt;/a&gt; as it was manifested in the &lt;a href=\"mass%20media\"&gt;mass media&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href=\"consumerism\"&gt;consumerism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cultural%20liberalism\"&gt;cultural liberalism&lt;/a&gt; which were associated with it. In a speech on the Fourth Plenum of the Central Committee of the PLA (PLA-CC) on 26 June 1973, Hoxha declared a definitive break with any such Western bourgeois influence and what he described as its \"&lt;a href=\"degeneration%20theory\"&gt;degenerated&lt;/a&gt; bourgeois culture\". In a speech in which he also criticised the \"spread of certain vulgar, alien tastes in music and art\", which ran \"contrary to socialist ethics and the positive traditions of our people\", including \"degenerate importations such as long hair, extravagant dress, screaming jungle music, coarse language, shameless behaviour and so on\", Hoxha declared:\nLater life and death.\nIn 1974, Hoxha accused &lt;a href=\"Beqir%20Balluku\"&gt;Beqir Balluku&lt;/a&gt;, Minister of Defence and longtime ally, of being an agent of China and attempting a &lt;a href=\"coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;, since Balluku had criticized Hoxha's bunker program and stated that a U.S. and Soviet invasion of Albania was unlikely. Hoxha sentenced Balluku and a group of his accused associates to death and appointed Mehmet Shehu as Minister of Defence.\nA new Constitution was decided upon by the Seventh Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour on 1\u20137 November 1976. According to Hoxha, \"The old Constitution was the Constitution of the building of the foundations of socialism, whereas the new Constitution will be the Constitution of the complete construction of a socialist society.\"\nSelf-reliance was now stressed more than ever. Citizens were encouraged to train in the use of weapons, and this activity was also taught in schools. The purpose of this training was to encourage the creation of quick &lt;a href=\"Partisan%20%28military%29\"&gt;partisans&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorrowing and foreign investment were banned under Article 26 of the Constitution, which read: \"The granting of concessions to, and the creation of foreign economic and financial companies and other institutions or ones formed jointly with bourgeois and revisionist capitalist monopolies and states as well as obtaining credits from them are prohibited in the People's Socialist Republic of Albania.\" Hoxha said of borrowing money and allowing investment from other countries:\nDuring this period, Albania was the most isolated country in Europe. However, as a result of economic self-sufficiency, Albania had a minimal foreign debt. In 1983, Albania imported goods which were worth $280\u00a0million but it exported goods which were worth $290\u00a0million, producing a trade surplus of $10\u00a0million.\nIn 1981, Hoxha ordered the execution of several party and government officials in a new purge. Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Mehmet%20Shehu\"&gt;Mehmet Shehu&lt;/a&gt;, the second-most powerful man in Albania and Hoxha's closest comrade-in-arms for 40 years, was reported to have committed suicide in December 1981. He was subsequently condemned as a \"traitor\" to Albania and he was also accused of operating in the service of multiple &lt;a href=\"intelligence%20agency\"&gt;intelligence agencies&lt;/a&gt;. It is generally believed that he was either killed or he shot himself during a power struggle which may have resulted from differing foreign policy matters with Hoxha. Hoxha also wrote a large assortment of books during this period, resulting in over 65 volumes of collected works, condensed into six volumes of selected works.\nIn 1973, Hoxha suffered a &lt;a href=\"heart%20attack\"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; from which he never fully recovered. In increasingly precarious health from the late 1970s onward, he turned most state functions over to &lt;a href=\"Ramiz%20Alia\"&gt;Ramiz Alia&lt;/a&gt;. In his final days, he was confined to a &lt;a href=\"wheelchair\"&gt;wheelchair&lt;/a&gt; and suffered from &lt;a href=\"diabetes\"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, with which he was diagnosed in 1948, along with &lt;a href=\"cerebral%20ischemia\"&gt;cerebral ischemia&lt;/a&gt;, with which he was diagnosed in 1983. On 9 April 1985, he was struck by a &lt;a href=\"ventricular%20fibrillation\"&gt;ventricular fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;. Over the next 48 hours, he suffered repeated episodes of this arrhythmia, and he died in the early morning hours of 11 April 1985 at the age of 76. Hoxha's body lay in state at the building of the Presidium of the People's Assembly for three days before he was buried on 15 April after a memorial service on &lt;a href=\"Skanderbeg%20Square\"&gt;Skanderbeg Square&lt;/a&gt;. The government refused to accept any foreign delegations during Hoxha's funeral and it even condemned the Soviet message of condolences as \"unacceptable\". After his burial, Hoxha was succeeded as head of state by &lt;a href=\"Ramiz%20Alia\"&gt;Ramiz Alia&lt;/a&gt;, who gained control of the party's leadership two days later.\nHoxha's death left Albania with a legacy of isolation and fear of the outside world. Despite some economic progress which Albania made during Hoxha's rule, the country was in &lt;a href=\"economic%20stagnation\"&gt;economic stagnation&lt;/a&gt;; Albania had been the poorest European country throughout much of the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; period. Following &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20communism%20in%20Albania\"&gt;Albania's transition to capitalism&lt;/a&gt; in 1992, Hoxha's legacy diminished, so that by the early 21st century very little of it was still in place in Albania.\nFamily.\nThe surname \"Hoxha\" is the Albanian variant of &lt;a href=\"Hodja\"&gt;Hodja&lt;/a&gt; (from ), a title given to his ancestors due to their efforts to teach Albanians about Islam.\nHoxha's parents were Halil and Gjylihan (Gjylo) Hoxha, and Hoxha had three sisters, Fahrije, Haxhire and Sanije. &lt;a href=\"Hysen%20Hoxha\"&gt;Hysen Hoxha&lt;/a&gt; () was Enver Hoxha's uncle and was a militant who campaigned vigorously for the independence of Albania, which occurred when Enver was four years old. His grandfather Beqir was involved in the Gjirokast\u00ebr section of the &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Prizren\"&gt;League of Prizren&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoxha's son Sokol Hoxha was the CEO of the Albanian Post and Telecommunication service, and is married to Liliana Hoxha. &lt;a href=\"Sali%20Berisha\"&gt;Sali Berisha&lt;/a&gt;, a later democratic president of Albania, was often seen socialising with Sokol Hoxha and other close relatives of leading communist figures in Albania.\nHoxha's daughter, Pranvera, is an architect. Along with her husband, Klement Kolaneci, she designed the Enver Hoxha Museum in &lt;a href=\"Tirana\"&gt;Tirana&lt;/a&gt;, a white-tiled pyramid. Some sources have referred to the edifice, said to be the most expensive ever constructed in Albanian history, as the \"Enver Hoxha Mausoleum\", though this was not an official appellation. The museum opened in 1988, three years after her father's death, and in 1991 was transformed into a conference centre and exhibition venue renamed &lt;a href=\"Pyramid%20of%20Tirana\"&gt;Pyramid of Tirana&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssassination attempts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Banda%20Mustafaj\"&gt;Banda Mustafaj&lt;/a&gt; gang was connected to counter-revolutionary elements such as the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20mafia\"&gt;Albanian mafia&lt;/a&gt; and members of the royal &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Zogu\"&gt;House of Zogu&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1982 attempted to assassinate Enver Hoxha. The plan failed and two of its members were killed and another one was arrested. According to Hoxha, documents from long-time Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu's vault were found after his death in 1981 pertaining to orders by Yugoslav intelligence to poison him and assume the leadership of the country. In his book \"The Titoites\", Hoxha hypotheses that this plan failed because Shehu was a coward who could not go through with the task and figured that suicide would, at the very least, save his family from the punishment for his counter-revolutionary activity.\nLegacy.\nA 2016 survey conducted by the \"Institute for Development Research and Alternatives\" (IDRA), showed that 42% of Albanians believe that Enver Hoxha had a positive impact on history \u2013 not much less than 45% who see his impact as negative. Citizens in the regions of southern and southwestern Albania that were interviewed, had the most positive view of Hoxha, with 55%."
