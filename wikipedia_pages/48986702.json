    "text": "Nolan James Patrick (born September 19, 1998) is a &lt;a href=\"Canadians\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; professional &lt;a href=\"ice%20hockey\"&gt;ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; player for the &lt;a href=\"Vegas%20Golden%20Knights\"&gt;Vegas Golden Knights&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; (NHL). He was drafted second overall by the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Flyers\"&gt;Philadelphia Flyers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2017%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft\"&gt;2017 NHL Entry Draft&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nAs Patrick became more involved in hockey, his father transformed their family garage into a home gym and he trained with his uncle during the summer. He played AAA Bantam Hockey League Division 1 ice hockey with the Winnipeg Hawks during its 2012\u201313 season, where he recorded 75 points in 19 games. He missed nearly half of the season due to a shoulder injury, but nonetheless was regarded as a highly touted prospect.\nPatrick was selected in 1st round, fourth overall, by the &lt;a href=\"Brandon%20Wheat%20Kings\"&gt;Brandon Wheat Kings&lt;/a&gt; in the 2013 &lt;a href=\"WHL%20Bantam%20Draft\"&gt;WHL Bantam Draft&lt;/a&gt;. In December 2013, during the midst of the Wheat Kings' &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20WHL%20season\"&gt;2013\u201314 season&lt;/a&gt;, a high number of injuries to the roster caused him to be called up from the Midget AAA Winnipeg Thrashers. He was initially unavailable upon being called up due to a shoulder injury, and did not play during the call-up. He eventually played three games with the Wheat Kings at the conclusion of his Winnipeg Thrashers' season. He began his rookie season in the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20WHL%20season\"&gt;2014\u201315 season&lt;/a&gt;, where he scored 30 goals and 56 points in 55 games. Between mid-February and mid-March 2015, Patrick missed 12 games with an upper-body injury, although initial reports were that it was a lower-body injury. He was subsequently awarded the &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Piggott%20Memorial%20Trophy\"&gt;Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy&lt;/a&gt; as the WHL's rookie of the year despite missing a total of 17 games that season.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20WHL%20season\"&gt;2015\u201316 season&lt;/a&gt;, Patrick finished fifth in league scoring and was the first 17-year old Wheat King to score over 100 points since 1976\u201377 when &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Allison\"&gt;Ray Allison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Propp\"&gt;Brian Propp&lt;/a&gt; both eclipsed the century mark. He played an integral part in winning the &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Chynoweth%20Cup\"&gt;Ed Chynoweth Cup&lt;/a&gt;, leading all players in post-season points and was named the &lt;a href=\"WHL%20Playoff%20MVP\"&gt;WHL Playoff MVP&lt;/a&gt;. After the season, it was revealed that Patrick had suffered a &lt;a href=\"sports%20hernia\"&gt;sports hernia&lt;/a&gt; injury on April 27, 2016 during Game 4 of the WHL's Eastern Conference Final series against the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Deer%20Rebels\"&gt;Red Deer Rebels&lt;/a&gt; and had played through the WHL Finals and &lt;a href=\"2016%20Memorial%20Cup\"&gt;2016 Memorial Cup&lt;/a&gt; with the injury. Following the 2015\u201316 campaign, he received sports hernia surgery.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20WHL%20season\"&gt;2016\u201317 season&lt;/a&gt;, Patrick was named captain of the Wheat Kings. Beginning the season, Patrick was widely considered the top prospect of the &lt;a href=\"2017%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft\"&gt;2017 NHL Entry Draft&lt;/a&gt;. Dan Marr, NHL director of &lt;a href=\"NHL%20Central%20Scouting%20Bureau\"&gt;Central Scouting&lt;/a&gt; said \"Patrick is as complete an NHL package as you are going to find. From his pedigree, his skills, and assets, to his performance impact to date, he has everything any NHL team is looking for in a top prospect.\" After playing six games to begin the season, however, the Wheat Kings announced on October 14, 2016 that Patrick had once again been sidelined with an upper-body injury. Despite initially being diagnosed as day-to-day, the injury continued through November, when it was revealed to be a complication of the previous season's sports hernia injury. On December 5, 2016, &lt;a href=\"Hockey%20Canada\"&gt;Hockey Canada&lt;/a&gt; announced that Patrick had not been medically cleared to participate in Team Canada's 2017 World Junior training camp and thus would not play in the &lt;a href=\"2017%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships\"&gt;2017 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite missing most of the regular season and all four playoff games due to injuries, Patrick was ranked the No. 1 North American skater by &lt;a href=\"NHL%20Central%20Scouting%20Bureau\"&gt;NHL Central Scouting&lt;/a&gt;. Dan Marr stated \"He has more than proven over the last three years that he is the real deal and he will be an impact NHL player\". On June 23, 2017, Nolan Patrick was selected 2nd overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2017 NHL Draft. On July 17, 2017, Patrick was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Philadelphia Flyers. Before the Flyers development camp started, it was announced Patrick would not participate because he was recovering from abdominal surgery performed on June 13, 2017.\nProfessional.\nPhiladelphia Flyers.\nPatrick made his NHL debut on October 4, 2017 against the &lt;a href=\"San%20Jose%20Sharks\"&gt;San Jose Sharks&lt;/a&gt;. He registered his first NHL point in his third game with an assist on sophomore &lt;a href=\"Ivan%20Provorov\"&gt;Ivan Provorov&lt;/a&gt;'s goal against the &lt;a href=\"Anaheim%20Ducks\"&gt;Anaheim Ducks&lt;/a&gt; in a 3\u20132 OT victory. He scored his first NHL goal against the &lt;a href=\"Nashville%20Predators\"&gt;Nashville Predators&lt;/a&gt; in his fourth game on October 10, 2017. Patrick scored his first goal with 9:25 remaining in the second period. Patrick was hit by &lt;a href=\"Anaheim%20Ducks\"&gt;Anaheim Ducks&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Wagner\"&gt;Chris Wagner&lt;/a&gt; on October 24, 2017 and missed 9 games to recover from the injury. Patrick ended the regular season with 30 points in 73 games.\nIn his rookie season, the Flyers made the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs\"&gt;Stanley Cup playoffs&lt;/a&gt; and faced the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Penguins\"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt; in the first round. In Game 2 of the series, Patrick notched his first NHL Playoff goal. Patrick ended the post-season with 2 points in 6 games. On July 21, 2018, Patrick was selected as the number 1 breakout player for 2018\u201319 by NHL Network.\nWhile exercising during the 2019 off-season, Patrick began to feel headaches and felt his performance suffer as a result. He was initially diagnosed with an \"upper-body injury\" at the Flyers' training camp, and in September, a &lt;a href=\"neurologist\"&gt;neurologist&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Michigan\"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed Patrick with a &lt;a href=\"Migraine\"&gt;migraine disorder&lt;/a&gt;. When Fletcher announced Patrick's diagnosis, he clarified that the migraines were not believed to be related to hockey, and that the condition ran in Patrick's family. He began skating with the team in February 2020, and had hoped to start playing before the end of the regular season. The &lt;a href=\"2019-20%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2019-20 NHL season&lt;/a&gt; was suspended indefinitely on March 12, 2020, due to the &lt;a href=\"Impact%20of%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic%20on%20sports\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. When the NHL began their \"Return to Play Plan\" in July, Patrick was not on the Flyers' training camp roster.\nOn October 16, 2020, Patrick accepted a one-year qualifying offer from the Flyers, with a value of $874,125. Going into the Flyers' &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20NHL%20season\"&gt;2020\u201321&lt;/a&gt; training camp, Patrick cleared all medical protocols and began practicing on a line with &lt;a href=\"Travis%20Konecny\"&gt;Travis Konecny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carsen%20Twarynski\"&gt;Carsen Twarynski&lt;/a&gt;. Patrick scored a goal in the Flyers' season opener, a 6-3 rout of the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Penguins\"&gt;Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt;. It was his first NHL game in 650 days. He failed to carry that momentum through the rest of the pandemic-shortened season; Patrick played in 52 of the Flyers' 56 games, scoring only four goals and five assists and putting up a -30 plus-minus in the process. Patrick told reporters afterwards that he felt \"like I came in behind the eight-ball\", and that, at the start of the season, he had avoided strong contact due to his migraine disorder. He missed two games in the middle of April after taking a shot from teammate &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20Myers\"&gt;Philippe Myers&lt;/a&gt; off of the ear, an injury that Patrick worried would amplify his headaches.\nVegas Golden Knights.\nAfter the 2020\u201321 season, Patrick acquired a new &lt;a href=\"Sports%20agent\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt;, leading to rumors that he was going to request a trade from the Flyers. On July 17, 2021, shortly before the &lt;a href=\"2021%20NHL%20Expansion%20Draft\"&gt;2021 NHL Expansion Draft&lt;/a&gt;, the Flyers traded Patrick and Philippe Myers to the &lt;a href=\"Nashville%20Predators\"&gt;Nashville Predators&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for defenceman &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Ellis\"&gt;Ryan Ellis&lt;/a&gt;. While Myers remained in Nashville, the Predators immediately flipped Patrick to the &lt;a href=\"Vegas%20Golden%20Knights\"&gt;Vegas Golden Knights&lt;/a&gt; to acquire forward &lt;a href=\"Cody%20Glass\"&gt;Cody Glass&lt;/a&gt;. Two months later, Vegas signed Patrick to a two-year, $2.4 million contract. The Golden Knights suffered a rash of injuries through the first few games of the season, and Patrick was sidelined with an upper body injury on October 22, following his first goal of the season in a loss to the &lt;a href=\"Edmonton%20Oilers\"&gt;Edmonton Oilers&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational play.\nIn November 2014, Patrick was named captain for Canada Red at the &lt;a href=\"2014%20World%20U-17%20Hockey%20Challenge%20%28November%29\"&gt;2014 World U-17 Hockey Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatrick was not medically cleared to play for Team Canada at the &lt;a href=\"2017%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships\"&gt;2017 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships&lt;/a&gt;, although he was later invited to Team Canada's World Junior Summer Showcase prior to the &lt;a href=\"2018%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships\"&gt;2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships&lt;/a&gt;. \nPersonal life.\nPatrick has an impressive athletic lineage. His father, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Patrick\"&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt;, played 250 games in the NHL and his mother, Carrie (&lt;a href=\"n%C3%A9e\"&gt;n\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; Chernomaz), played volleyball with the &lt;a href=\"Winnipeg%20Wesmen\"&gt;University of Winnipeg Wesmen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Canada%20women%27s%20national%20volleyball%20team\"&gt;Canadian national volleyball team&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 she earned a Team Canada roster spot for the &lt;a href=\"1996%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1996 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; but a torn ACL prevented her from participating. On his paternal side, his grandfather, &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Patrick\"&gt;Stephen Patrick&lt;/a&gt;, played &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Winnipeg%20Blue%20Bombers\"&gt;Winnipeg Blue Bombers&lt;/a&gt; and later became a politician. His uncle, &lt;a href=\"James%20Patrick%20%28ice%20hockey%29\"&gt;James Patrick&lt;/a&gt;, played 1,280 games in the NHL and served as assistant coach for the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Sabres\"&gt;Buffalo Sabres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Stars\"&gt;Dallas Stars&lt;/a&gt; prior to securing his current position as head coach of the &lt;a href=\"Winnipeg%20Ice\"&gt;Winnipeg Ice&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Hockey%20League\"&gt;WHL&lt;/a&gt;. As a teen, Patrick trained with his uncle during the summer and has credited his uncle's influence as \u201chuge\u201d to his career. His paternal aunt, Tara, played collegiate volleyball at the University of Winnipeg where she and Patrick's mother were teammates. On his maternal side, his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Rich%20Chernomaz\"&gt;Rich Chernomaz&lt;/a&gt;, played 51 games in the NHL and currently serves as head coach of the &lt;a href=\"Ravensburg%20Towerstars\"&gt;Ravensburg Towerstars&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"DEL2\"&gt;DEL2&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatrick's two sisters also play hockey. His older sister, Madison, was a defenceman with the &lt;a href=\"UBC%20Thunderbirds\"&gt;University of British Columbia Thunderbirds&lt;/a&gt; from 2014 to 2019. His younger sister, Aimee, is committed to the &lt;a href=\"Manitoba%20Bisons%20women%27s%20ice%20hockey\"&gt;University of Manitoba Bisons&lt;/a&gt; and will be a freshman for the 2020\u201321 season.\nPatrick is of Ukrainian descent through his paternal great-grandfather, with the original family surname being \"Patrebka.\"\nPatrick and his family are also avid hunters.
