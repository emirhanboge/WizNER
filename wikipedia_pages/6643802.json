It was expanded and modernised by the npp government in 2008 during the cup of nations in Ghana although it was not one of the venues. Chairs from the renovated Accra sports stadium was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Sunyani\"&gt;Sunyani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"stadium\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; to improve upon its standard. The venue is sometimes used by some of the junior national teams for friendlies. Currently it is not used by any premiership club in the country."
