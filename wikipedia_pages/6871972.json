    "text": "Following the social upheavals of the 1960s, &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; became one of the centers of &lt;a href=\"Modern%20liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; activism, with &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;progressives&lt;/a&gt; dominating city politics. This continuing trend is also visible in the results of presidential elections; the last &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; to win San Francisco was &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower\"&gt;Dwight Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1956%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1956&lt;/a&gt;. Although the fight between Democrats and Republicans has been unequal for the last forty years, it has become increasingly lopsided, with &lt;a href=\"Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; commentators frequently attacking the city's politics using the \"&lt;a href=\"ad%20hominem\"&gt;ad hominem&lt;/a&gt;\" phrase, \"&lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20values\"&gt;San Francisco values&lt;/a&gt;\". In spite of its heavy liberal leanings, San Francisco has the highest percentage of \"&lt;a href=\"Independent%20%28voter%29\"&gt;no party preference&lt;/a&gt;\" voters of any California county, as of November, 2012. Campaign corruption is monitored by the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Ethics%20Commission\"&gt;San Francisco Ethics Commission&lt;/a&gt; and violations result in fines up to $5,000 per violation.\nState and federal representation.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20Senate\"&gt;California State Senate&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco is in . In the &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20Assembly\"&gt;California State Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, it is split between , and .\nIn the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco is split between two congressional districts. Most of the city is in the &lt;a href=\"California%27s%2012th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;12th District&lt;/a&gt;, represented by . A sliver in the southwest is part of the &lt;a href=\"California%27s%2014th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;14th District&lt;/a&gt; represented by . Pelosi has been the current &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;House Speaker&lt;/a&gt; since January 3, 2019, a post she also held from 2007 through 2011. She has also held the post of &lt;a href=\"House%20Minority%20Leader\"&gt;House Minority Leader&lt;/a&gt;, from 2003 to 2007 and 2011 to 2019.\nLocal politics.\nThe city is governed by a &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20San%20Francisco\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; and an 11-member &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Board%20of%20Supervisors\"&gt;Board of Supervisors&lt;/a&gt;, both elected using &lt;a href=\"Ranked%20voting%20systems\"&gt;preferential voting&lt;/a&gt;. The current mayor is &lt;a href=\"London%20Breed\"&gt;London Breed&lt;/a&gt;.\nHousing.\nHousing is a frequent topic in San Francisco politics.\nSan Francisco has the highest housing prices in the United States. As of 2018, its median house price was $1.61 million, almost twice the average from five years earlier. Many factors contribute to the housing situation in San Francisco. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of available homes to live in. The Bay Area, from 2011 to 2015, only created 1 home for every 8 jobs created.\nSan Francisco has some of the most stringent housing laws in the United States. It ranks 3rd among cities in the United States as the hardest city to build in.\nIt has been estimated by San Francisco's chief economist that in order for prices in San Francisco to stabilize, the city would need around 100,000 units to reduce prices."
