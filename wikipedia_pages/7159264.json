    "text": "Ringgit Operations Monitoring System (ROMS) is a large-value foreign exchange transaction reporting system owned and operated by &lt;a href=\"Bank%20Negara%20Malaysia\"&gt;Bank Negara Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; (BNM), the &lt;a href=\"central%20bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. It automates a major part of compliance reporting between Authorised Dealers (who are licensed FX intermediaries) and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM).\nROMS is built using web-based technology and runs on a &lt;a href=\"web%20browser\"&gt;web browser&lt;/a&gt; on a PC workstation to minimise cost, ease maintenance and establish a user-friendly interface.\nData security is implemented by using a secure private &lt;a href=\"broadband\"&gt;broadband&lt;/a&gt; network between BNM and financial institutions. This network is called FINET. ROMS is not deployed over the Internet.\nFINET in turn, runs over COINS, a nationwide enterprise level data network operated by &lt;a href=\"Telekom%20Malaysia\"&gt;Telekom Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, the national telecommunication provider. Users are authenticated via a password challenge-response process, &lt;a href=\"IP%20address\"&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt; registration and digital certificates.\nReporting financial institutions are required to report all wholesale FX transactions above USD $1 million on trade date basis.\nThe daily system start-up time for ROMS is at 8:00 a.m. while the system cut-off time for the submission via ROMS is at 5:00 p.m. \nAny extension on the system cut-off time is at BNM's discretion based on the financial institution (FI) or authorised dealer (AD) request; however, the authorised dealer will be charged a specific fine in order to do so.\nIf a failure to submit all transaction reports occurs on the same day into the ROMS system, BNM will impose a fine to the specific AD as a penalty.\nOther FX transactions below USD $1 million and above RM 50,000 are recorded on a lagged basis but must be within the fortnightly reporting period (before the 15th and end-of-month).\nTransactions.\nThere are three main transaction types inside ROMS which are:\n1. Swap\n2. Forex\n3. Third currency\nBy the end of day after system closing time, \nthe ROMS manager or the system administrator processes all transactions recorded for the day and extracts them from the ROMS system.\nFollowing that, the data is calculated using three type of calculation formats, which are:\nAfterwards, the data taken from ROMS is submitted to the BNM portal where it is combined with other data from another Foreign Exchange Administration (FEA) system to calculate the exchange rate for that day; the final result is posted on the BNM websites under these following sections:\n1. Exchange rates \n2. USD/MYR interbank intraday rate\n3. Daily FX turnover \n4. Interbank swap "
