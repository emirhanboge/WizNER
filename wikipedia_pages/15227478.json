    "text": "Dock4, (Dedicator of cytokinesis 4) also known as DOCK4, is a large (~190 kDa) &lt;a href=\"protein\"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; involved in &lt;a href=\"intracellular\"&gt;intracellular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cell%20signalling\"&gt;signalling networks&lt;/a&gt;. It is a member of the DOCK-B subfamily of the &lt;a href=\"DOCK%20%28protein%29\"&gt;DOCK&lt;/a&gt; family of &lt;a href=\"guanine%20nucleotide%20exchange%20factor\"&gt;guanine nucleotide exchange factor&lt;/a&gt;s (GEFs) which function as activators of small &lt;a href=\"G%20protein\"&gt;G protein&lt;/a&gt;s. Dock4 activates the small G proteins &lt;a href=\"Rac%20%28GTPase%29\"&gt;Rac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rap%20GTP-binding%20protein\"&gt;Rap1&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiscovery.\nDock4 was discovered as a &lt;a href=\"gene%20product\"&gt;gene product&lt;/a&gt; which was disrupted during &lt;a href=\"tumour\"&gt;tumour&lt;/a&gt; progression in a murine cancer model-derived &lt;a href=\"osteosarcoma\"&gt;osteosarcoma&lt;/a&gt; cell line. Subsequent &lt;a href=\"Northern%20blot\"&gt;Northern blot&lt;/a&gt; analysis revealed high levels of Dock4 &lt;a href=\"Gene%20expression\"&gt;expression&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20muscle\"&gt;skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"prostate\"&gt;prostate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ovary\"&gt;ovary&lt;/a&gt; as well as lower levels in the &lt;a href=\"heart\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"placenta\"&gt;placenta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colon%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt;. A separate study has reported expression of a Dock4 &lt;a href=\"Alternative%20splicing\"&gt;splice variant&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dock4-Ex49\"&gt;Dock4-Ex49&lt;/a&gt;) in the brain, &lt;a href=\"inner%20ear\"&gt;inner ear&lt;/a&gt; and eye.\nStructure and function.\nDock4 is part of a large class of proteins (GEFs) which contribute to cellular signalling events by activating small G proteins. In their resting state G proteins are bound to &lt;a href=\"Guanosine%20diphosphate\"&gt;Guanosine diphosphate&lt;/a&gt; (GDP) and their activation requires the dissociation of GDP and binding of &lt;a href=\"guanosine%20triphosphate\"&gt;guanosine triphosphate&lt;/a&gt; (GTP). GEFs activate G proteins by promoting this nucleotide exchange.\nThe domain arrangement of Dock4 is largely equivalent to that of &lt;a href=\"Dock180\"&gt;Dock180&lt;/a&gt; (the archetypal member of the &lt;a href=\"DOCK%20%28protein%29\"&gt;DOCK&lt;/a&gt; family) and other DOCK-A/B family members (35% &lt;a href=\"Sequence%20alignment\"&gt;sequence identity&lt;/a&gt; with Dock180, 39% with &lt;a href=\"Dock2\"&gt;Dock2&lt;/a&gt; and 54% with &lt;a href=\"Dock3\"&gt;Dock3&lt;/a&gt;). Dock4, however, contains a unique set of &lt;a href=\"Structural%20motif\"&gt;motifs&lt;/a&gt; at its &lt;a href=\"proline\"&gt;proline&lt;/a&gt;-rich &lt;a href=\"C-terminus\"&gt;C-terminus&lt;/a&gt; which include a &lt;a href=\"Src%20%28gene%29\"&gt;Src&lt;/a&gt;-binding site that is shared with &lt;a href=\"CED-5\"&gt;CED-5&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Caenorhabditis%20elegans\"&gt;C. elegans&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"ortholog\"&gt;ortholog&lt;/a&gt; of mammalian DOCK proteins. Dock4 also contains a &lt;a href=\"DHR2%20domain\"&gt;DHR2 domain&lt;/a&gt; (also known as Docker2 or CZH2) which is conserved among DOCK family proteins and mediates GEF-dependent functions, and a &lt;a href=\"DHR1%20domain\"&gt;DHR1 domain&lt;/a&gt; (CZH1/Docker1) which has been shown to bind &lt;a href=\"Phosphatidylinositol%20%283%2C4%2C5%29-trisphosphate\"&gt;PtdIns(3,4,5)P3&lt;/a&gt;, an important step in recruitment to the &lt;a href=\"plasma%20membrane\"&gt;plasma membrane&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegulation of Dock4 activity.\nDOCK family proteins are inefficient at promoting nucleotide exchange on their own since they appear to adopt an autoinhibitory &lt;a href=\"Protein%20folding\"&gt;conformation&lt;/a&gt; in their resting state. The &lt;a href=\"Signal%20transducing%20adaptor%20protein\"&gt;adaptor protein&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ELMO%20%28protein%29\"&gt;ELMO&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to bind DOCK proteins and induce a conformational change which relieves the inhibition and allows G proteins access to the DHR2 domain. Binding to ELMO requires the atypical &lt;a href=\"PH%20domain\"&gt;PH domain&lt;/a&gt; of ELMO and also involves an interaction between the &lt;a href=\"N-terminal\"&gt;N-terminal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"SH3%20domain\"&gt;SH3 domain&lt;/a&gt; of DOCK and a proline-rich motif at the ELMO C-terminus. ELMO also binds the activated form of the small G protein &lt;a href=\"RhoG\"&gt;RhoG&lt;/a&gt; and this has been shown to promote DOCK-dependent signalling by helping recruit the ELMO-DOCK &lt;a href=\"protein%20complex\"&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; to areas of high &lt;a href=\"substrate%20%28biochemistry%29\"&gt;substrate&lt;/a&gt; availability (usually the plasma membrane). The C-terminus of DOCK proteins interacts with another adaptor protein, &lt;a href=\"CRK%20%28gene%29\"&gt;Crk&lt;/a&gt;. Dock4 undergoes RhoG/ELMO-dependent recruitment to the plasma membrane and promotes &lt;a href=\"cell%20migration\"&gt;migration&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"fibroblasts\"&gt;fibroblasts&lt;/a&gt;. In rat &lt;a href=\"hippocampus\"&gt;hippocampal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"neurone\"&gt;neurone&lt;/a&gt;s Dock4 forms a trimeric complex with &lt;a href=\"ELMO2\"&gt;ELMO2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CrkII\"&gt;CrkII&lt;/a&gt; which is required for the normal development of &lt;a href=\"dendrite\"&gt;dendrite&lt;/a&gt;s. More recently, a role has been described for Dock4 as part of the &lt;a href=\"Wnt%20signalling%20pathway\"&gt;Wnt signalling pathway&lt;/a&gt; which regulates &lt;a href=\"cell%20proliferation\"&gt;cell proliferation&lt;/a&gt; and migration. In this system Dock4 was reported to undergo &lt;a href=\"phosphorylation\"&gt;phosphorylation&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Glycogen%20synthase%20kinase%203\"&gt;Glycogen synthase kinase 3&lt;/a&gt; (GSK-3) which stimulated an increase in Dock4 GEF activity.\nSignalling downstream of Dock4.\nDOCK family proteins contribute to cell signalling by activating G proteins of the Rho family, such as Rac and &lt;a href=\"Cdc42\"&gt;Cdc42&lt;/a&gt;. Dock4 has also been shown to activate Rap1, a feature not reported in any of the other DOCK family proteins to date. Dock4 dependent Rac activation regulates reorganisation of the &lt;a href=\"cytoskeleton\"&gt;cytoskeleton&lt;/a&gt; and leads to the formation of membrane protrusions (e.g. &lt;a href=\"lamellipodia\"&gt;lamellipodia&lt;/a&gt;) which are a crucial step in neuronal development and cell migration. The effect of Dock4 on the Wnt pathway appears to be mediated through Rac activation as well as through GEF-independent associations with components of the \"&lt;a href=\"Beta-catenin\"&gt;\u03b2-catenin&lt;/a&gt; degradation complex\".\nDock4 in cancer.\nMutations in Dock4 have been described in a number of cancers. The exact mechanism and extent to which it regulates cancer-associated signalling pathways is poorly understood thus far although a mutation in Dock4 which affects its GEF specificity has been reported to promote detachment and invasion of cancer cells."
