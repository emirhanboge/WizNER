The budget previously dedicated to the military is now dedicated to security, education and culture. Costa Rica maintains Police Guard forces.\nThe museum was placed in the as a symbol of commitment to culture. In 1986, President &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Arias%20S%C3%A1nchez\"&gt;Oscar Arias S\u00e1nchez&lt;/a&gt; declared December 1 as the (Military abolition day) with Law #8115. Unlike its neighbors, Costa Rica has not endured a &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; since 1948. Costa Rica maintains small forces capable of law enforcement, but has no permanent &lt;a href=\"standing%20army\"&gt;standing army&lt;/a&gt;.\nPublic Force of the Ministry of Public Security (1996).\nIn 1996, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20%28Costa%20Rica%29\"&gt;Ministry of Public Security&lt;/a&gt; established the or Public Force, a &lt;a href=\"gendarmerie\"&gt;gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt; which reorganised and eliminated the &lt;a href=\"Costa%20Rican%20Civil%20Guard\"&gt;Civil Guard&lt;/a&gt;, Rural Assistance Guard, and Frontier Guards as separate entities. They are now under the Ministry and operate on a geographic command basis performing ground security, law enforcement, counter-narcotics, border patrol, and tourism security functions. The Costa Rica Coast Guard also operates directly under the Ministry.\nOutside the Fuerza P\u00fablica, there is a small Special Forces Unit, the Unidad Especial de Intervencion (UEI) or Special Intervention Unit, an elite commando force which trains with special forces from around the world, but is not part of the main police forces. Instead it is part of the Intelligence and Security Directorate (DIS) which reports directly to the Minister of the Presidency. About 70 members strong, it is organized along military lines, although officially a civilian police unit.\nThe motto of the Public Force is \"God, Fatherland, and Honour.\" Commissioner of Police Juan Jos\u00e9 Andrade Morales serves as its current Commissioner General.\nEquipment.\nHandguns\nSubmachine guns\nShotguns\nAssault rifles\nMachine guns \nSniper rifles \nGrenade launchers "
