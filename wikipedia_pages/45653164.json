    "text": "The Lap Engine is a &lt;a href=\"beam%20engine\"&gt;beam engine&lt;/a&gt; designed by &lt;a href=\"James%20Watt\"&gt;James Watt&lt;/a&gt;, built by &lt;a href=\"Boulton%20and%20Watt\"&gt;Boulton and Watt&lt;/a&gt; in 1788. It is now preserved at the &lt;a href=\"Science%20Museum%2C%20London\"&gt;Science Museum, London&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is important as both an early example of a beam engine by Boulton and Watt, and also mainly as illustrating an important innovative step in their development for its ability to produce rotary motion.\nThe engines name comes from its use in &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Boulton\"&gt;Matthew Boulton&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Soho%20Manufactory\"&gt;Soho Manufactory&lt;/a&gt;, where it was used to drive a line of 43 polishing or &lt;a href=\"lapping\"&gt;lapping&lt;/a&gt; machines, used for the &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20toy%20industry\"&gt;production of buttons and buckles&lt;/a&gt;.\nInnovations.\nWatt did not invent the &lt;a href=\"steam%20engine\"&gt;steam engine&lt;/a&gt; and there is no single '&lt;a href=\"Watt%20steam%20engine\"&gt;Watt steam engine&lt;/a&gt;' as such. He developed a number of separate innovations, each of which improved the existing engines of the day, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Newcomen%20atmospheric%20engine\"&gt;Newcomen's&lt;/a&gt;. The Lap Engine of 1788, also the &lt;a href=\"Whitbread%20Engine\"&gt;Whitbread Engine&lt;/a&gt; (1785), represent survivors of the first engines to show all of Watt's major improvements in one.\nSun and planet gear.\nThe &lt;a href=\"rotative%20beam%20engine\"&gt;rotative beam engine&lt;/a&gt; needs a means to convert &lt;a href=\"reciprocating%20motion\"&gt;reciprocating motion&lt;/a&gt; of the piston and beam to &lt;a href=\"rotary%20motion\"&gt;rotary motion&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"crankshaft\"&gt;crankshaft&lt;/a&gt; was well known for centuries before Watt, mostly from its use in mining machinery powered by &lt;a href=\"water%20wheel\"&gt;water wheel&lt;/a&gt;s. However its use for a steam engine was covered by &lt;a href=\"James%20Pickard\"&gt;James Pickard&lt;/a&gt;'s patent at this time. Watt was unwilling to pay a license fee to use the &lt;a href=\"crank%20%28mechanism%29\"&gt;crank&lt;/a&gt; and so sought an alternative. The sun and planet gear was invented by another &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20people\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; engineer, &lt;a href=\"William%20Murdoch\"&gt;William Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;, an employee of &lt;a href=\"Boulton%20and%20Watt\"&gt;Boulton and Watt&lt;/a&gt;. Watt patented it in October 1781.\nThe sun and planet gear is a simple &lt;a href=\"epicyclic%20gear\"&gt;epicyclic gear&lt;/a&gt;. The planet is attached rigidly to the end of the &lt;a href=\"connecting%20rod\"&gt;connecting rod&lt;/a&gt;, hung from the beam. As it rotates it applies a torque to the sun gear, just as for a crank, and so causes it to rotate. As the two gears also rotate relative to each other, like conventional gearwheels, this has the effect of giving the sun gear a further rotation. The sun, and the output crankshaft, thus rotates twice for every piston cycle of the engine, twice as fast as with a conventional crank. Beam engines were slow-moving and the output shafts driven by the Lap Engine were fast-moving, so this was an advantage.\nCentrifugal governor.\nAccording to the Science Museum, it was the first steam engine to be fitted with a &lt;a href=\"centrifugal%20governor\"&gt;centrifugal governor&lt;/a&gt;."
