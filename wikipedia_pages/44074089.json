    "text": "In newspapers, a pony express was the express delivery systems which newspapers used in the 19th century to obtain news faster or publish it prior to rival publications. As with the celebrated &lt;a href=\"Pony%20Express\"&gt;Pony Express&lt;/a&gt; of 1860-61, these systems were eventually supplanted by &lt;a href=\"Electrical%20telegraph\"&gt;telegraph&lt;/a&gt; lines.\nPony express systems.\nIn December 1830, three New York concerns competed to be the first to publish President Andrew Jackson's &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20the%20Union%20address\"&gt;annual message to Congress&lt;/a&gt; -- \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Journal%20of%20Commerce\"&gt;The Journal of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Courier%20and%20Enquirer\"&gt;New York Courier and Enquirer&lt;/a&gt;\", and the Association of Morning Papers. &lt;a href=\"James%20Gordon%20Bennett%2C%20Sr.\"&gt;James Gordon Bennett&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Courier and Enquirer\" arranged for a horseback express from Washington to Baltimore, followed by a ship to Philadelphia and second horseback leg to New York City. The run took six hours and cost almost $300, but the \"Courier and Enquirer\" prevailed over its competitors.\nThe \"Journal of Commerce\" initiated a regular eight-relay express from Philadelphia to New York in January 1833. After its rivals sought federal governments help through the establishment of an express government delivery system, the \"Journal\" expanded its line directly to Washington, D.C., giving it a news advantage of one to three days.\nThe telegraph defeats the horse.\nBy the 1840s, the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Herald\"&gt;New York Herald&lt;/a&gt;\" (founded by Bennett in 1835) had developed an express route from &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Albany, New York&lt;/a&gt; (the capital of the state of New York) to New York City. Bennett knew that telegraph lines &lt;a href=\"Timeline%20of%20North%20American%20telegraphy\"&gt;were being built&lt;/a&gt;, but had rebuffed attempts to sell him on its merits, as he favored his established methods and the advantage it gave him over his competition. But in January 1847, the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Evening%20Express\"&gt;New York Evening Express&lt;/a&gt;\" accepted the offer of &lt;a href=\"Ezra%20Cornell\"&gt;Ezra Cornell&lt;/a&gt; to use his new &lt;a href=\"Electrical%20telegraph\"&gt;telegraph line&lt;/a&gt; from Albany to New York to get legislative news, and the \"Express\" was able to publish a new message from the governor in advance of the \"Herald\" pony express line. Beaten badly to press, the \"Herald\" was forced abandoned its opposition to the telegraph.\nPony express systems, however, continued to be developed when and where telegraph lines did not exist, though the systems would always dissolve once telegraph lines went into service. Thus, in 1846, during the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War\"&gt;Mexican\u2013American War&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Sun\"&gt;Baltimore Sun&lt;/a&gt;\" and Philadelphia \"Public Ledger\" established a sixty-pony express route to &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. This provided Americans with their first taste of close to real-time coverage of warfare. And in 1861, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Oregonian\"&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/a&gt;\" newspaper organized a pony express and &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; replay to obtain dispatches and &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; news days ahead of rival papers in &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, who relied on reports to arrive by steamer from &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;.\nNova Scotia Pony Express (1849).\nGetting news from Europe fostered a Pony Express service across &lt;a href=\"Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;. In February 1849, the &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; financed this relay service to carry the latest European news to New York newspapers. Ships would arrive in &lt;a href=\"Halifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; from Europe, carrying news that would then travel by Pony Express across Nova Scotia from Halifax to &lt;a href=\"Digby%20Gut\"&gt;Digby Gut&lt;/a&gt;, where it would travel again by ship across the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Fundy\"&gt;Bay of Fundy&lt;/a&gt; to the nearest telegraph station at &lt;a href=\"Saint%20John%2C%20New%20Brunswick\"&gt;Saint John, New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt;. There, news was transmitted to other East Coast cities by telegraph. The trip covered some 146 miles in as little as eight hours, with mount changes along the route and a rider change at &lt;a href=\"Kentville\"&gt;Kentville&lt;/a&gt;. Once the telegraph line reached &lt;a href=\"Halifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; in November 1849, the express was ended. After that, competition for European news focused on trying to send news from ships to the telegraph faster, such as the express newsboat which the Associated Press operated from &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Race\"&gt;Cape Race&lt;/a&gt; in Newfoundland from 1859\u201366, which ceased after reliable &lt;a href=\"transatlantic%20telegraph%20cable\"&gt;transatlantic telegraph cable&lt;/a&gt; service was established. The Pony Express was designated a &lt;a href=\"Events%20of%20National%20Historic%20Significance%20%28Canada%29\"&gt;National Historic Event&lt;/a&gt; in 1950, and a federal plaque was erected at its western terminus at &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Beach%2C%20Nova%20Scotia\"&gt;Victoria Beach&lt;/a&gt; on the Digby Gut."
