    "text": "Glubbdubdrib (also spelled Glubdubdrib or Glubbdubdribb in some editions) was an island of &lt;a href=\"Magician%20%28fantasy%29\"&gt;sorcerers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28illusion%29\"&gt;magicians&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"fictional%20country\"&gt;imaginary countries&lt;/a&gt; visited by &lt;a href=\"Lemuel%20Gulliver\"&gt;Lemuel Gulliver&lt;/a&gt; in the 1726 satirical novel \"&lt;a href=\"Gulliver%27s%20Travels\"&gt;Gulliver's Travels&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Irish\"&gt;Anglo-Irish&lt;/a&gt; author &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Swift\"&gt;Jonathan Swift&lt;/a&gt;. The episode on Glubbdubdrib \"explores the theme of humanity's progressive degeneration.\"\nLocation.\nThe location of Glubdubdrib is illustrated in both the text and the map at the beginning of part III of \"Gulliver's Travels\", though they are not consistent with each other. \nThe map shows Glubdubdrib to be southwest of the port of &lt;a href=\"Maldonada%20%28Gulliver%27s%20Travels%29\"&gt;Maldonada&lt;/a&gt; on the southwest coast of &lt;a href=\"Luggnagg\"&gt;Luggnagg&lt;/a&gt;, while the text states the island is southwest of &lt;a href=\"Balnibarbi\"&gt;Balnibarbi&lt;/a&gt;, and Maldonada to be a port of that land.\nDescription.\nGlubbdubdrib is about one third as large as the Isle of Wight. The inhabitants of Glubbdubdrib can wield magic, and most of their technology is utilized through magical means. The eldest in succession is prince or governor of the island. He has a 'noble' palace, and a park of about three thousand &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s, surrounded by a wall of hewn stone twenty &lt;a href=\"foot%20%28length%29\"&gt;foot&lt;/a&gt; high.\nOn visiting Glubbdubdrib, Gulliver had the occasion, thanks to the power of their &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, to speak with &lt;a href=\"Brutus\"&gt;Brutus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Rome\"&gt;ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt;, whom Gulliver greatly admired, among many other famous historical personages, including &lt;a href=\"Socrates\"&gt;Socrates&lt;/a&gt;. Many ideas of historians were corrected this way. Gulliver spends five days doing this, then three days looking at some of the 'modern' dead, trying to find the greatest figure in the past 200 or 300 years in his country and others in Europe. Gulliver gets a new view of historians and heroes, claiming 'I was chiefly disgusted with modern History'."
