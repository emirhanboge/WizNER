    "text": "MNW Music AB is a Swedish &lt;a href=\"record%20company\"&gt;record company&lt;/a&gt; and was founded in 1969 in &lt;a href=\"Vaxholm\"&gt;Vaxholm&lt;/a&gt; as Music Network Corps AB by Sverre Sundman, Lorne deWolfe and Lynn deWolfe. It is now located in &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter a financial crisis in the spring of 1971, the company was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Tore%20Berger\"&gt;Tore Berger&lt;/a&gt;, from the group Gunder H\u00e4gg (later &lt;a href=\"Bl%C3%A5%20T%C3%A5get\"&gt;Bl\u00e5 T\u00e5get&lt;/a&gt;), investing his own money and the company was transformed into Musikn\u00e4tet Waxholm.\nMNW was then one of the most important record companies in the music movement, focusing on Swedish musicians with Swedish texts, and political considerations often governed the publication. \"MNW Records Group\" was formed in 1993 when the company bought another record company called Amalthea.\nThe right to release records was transferred to \"Push Music Group\" in 2004. The collaboration ended and Push Music changed its name to \"MNW Music\".\nOn September 22, 2015 artist Johan Johansson (KSMB) won a lawsuit claiming that the MNW has put out music streaming services without a license."
