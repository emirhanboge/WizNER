She was ordered on 15 August 1940 and &lt;a href=\"Keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss\"&gt;Blohm &amp; Voss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, on 21 April 1941. She was &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 9 January 1942 and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; 5 March 1942\n\"Oberleutnant zur See\" Paul Siegmann was her first commanding officer. He was joined in May 1942 by &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Werner\"&gt;Herbert Werner&lt;/a&gt;, author of the book \"&lt;a href=\"Iron%20Coffins\"&gt;Iron Coffins&lt;/a&gt;\", as First Officer.\nWhile still on trials in the Baltic \"U-612\" was sunk in collision with on 6 August 1942. She was later salvaged and served as a training boat until the end of the war, when she was scuttled on 2 May 1945.\nDesign.\n&lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20VII%20submarine%23Type%20VIIC\"&gt;German Type VIIC submarines&lt;/a&gt; were preceded by the shorter &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20VII%20submarine%23Type%20VIIB\"&gt;Type VIIB submarines&lt;/a&gt;. \"U-612\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20hull\"&gt;pressure hull&lt;/a&gt; length of , a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of , a height of , and a &lt;a href=\"draught%20%28ship%29\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; of . The submarine was powered by two &lt;a href=\"Germaniawerft\"&gt;Germaniawerft&lt;/a&gt; F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder &lt;a href=\"supercharged\"&gt;supercharged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s producing a total of for use while surfaced, two &lt;a href=\"Brown%2C%20Boveri%20%26amp%3B%20Cie\"&gt;Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie&lt;/a&gt; GG UB 720/8 &lt;a href=\"Motor%E2%80%93generator\"&gt;double-acting electric motors&lt;/a&gt; producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two &lt;a href=\"propeller\"&gt;propeller&lt;/a&gt;s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"U-612\" was fitted with five &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es, one &lt;a href=\"8.8%20cm%20SK%20C/35%20naval%20gun\"&gt;SK C/35 naval gun&lt;/a&gt;, 220 rounds, and a &lt;a href=\"2%20cm%20FlaK%2030\"&gt;C/30&lt;/a&gt; anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20company\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; of between forty-four and sixty.\nService history.\nAfter commissioning, \"U-612\" was engaged in working up and sea trials in the eastern &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt;, assigned to &lt;a href=\"5th%20U-boat%20Flotilla\"&gt;5th U-boat Flotilla&lt;/a&gt; and based at &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6nigsberg\"&gt;K\u00f6nigsberg&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn 6 August 1942 she was at sea off &lt;a href=\"Danzig\"&gt;Danzig&lt;/a&gt; when she was accidentally rammed by \"U-444\". Werner describes the event in his book; he states neither boat was aware of the other and that the captain of \"U-444\" was unaware he had struck \"U-612\". He describes in detail the struggle to get out of the rapidly sinking U-boat, and the crew's rescue by two other U-boats, one of which he states was the hapless \"U-444\" Two men died in the incident.\nSiegman and his crew undertook to salvage \"U-612\" and put her back into action; the hull was raised during August but found to be too water-damaged for them to continue. The U-boat was handed over to the dockyard at Danzig and Seigmann and his crew were reassigned to another boat, .\n\"U-612\" completed repairs the following year and was re-commissioned 31 May 1943. However she was deemed unsuitable as a \"Front-boat\" and was confined to training in the Baltic. \nOn commissioning, under Oblt. T Petersen she joined &lt;a href=\"24th%20U-boat%20Flotilla\"&gt;24 Flotilla&lt;/a&gt;, a training unit. In February 1944 she joined &lt;a href=\"31st%20U-boat%20Flotilla\"&gt;31 Flotilla&lt;/a&gt;, another training unit, under the command of \"Oblt.z.S.\" HP Dick.\nOn 2 May 1945 she was caught at &lt;a href=\"Warnemunde\"&gt;Warnemunde&lt;/a&gt; by the advancing Red Army and was scuttled to avoid seizure."
