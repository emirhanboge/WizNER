It quickly became popular, especially in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and was first introduced to America in 1972. It remains popular in Continental Europe, but less so in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Elstar is a medium-sized apple whose skin is mostly red with yellow showing. The flesh is white, and has a soft, crispy texture. It may be used for cooking and is especially good for making &lt;a href=\"apple%20sauce\"&gt;apple sauce&lt;/a&gt;. In general, however, it is used in desserts due to its sweet flavour."
