In 1990, Ladislav \u010cis\u00e1rik and &lt;a href=\"Ladislav%20Vrtel\"&gt;Ladislav Vrtel&lt;/a&gt; co-designed the &lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Slovakia\"&gt;Coat of arms of Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;, the current &lt;a href=\"flag%20of%20Slovakia\"&gt;flag of Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"presidential%20standard\"&gt;presidential standard&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Slovakia\"&gt;President of Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;. He also designed or modified the &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;coat of arms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Seal%20%28emblem%29\"&gt;seals&lt;/a&gt; for more than 100 towns and municipalities in Slovakia.\nBiography.\nLadislav \u010cis\u00e1rik was born on 29 December 1953. He owned and operated his own &lt;a href=\"graphic%20design\"&gt;graphic design&lt;/a&gt; studio, called Signum, in &lt;a href=\"Bratislava\"&gt;Bratislava&lt;/a&gt; from 1979 until his death in 2017.\nLadislav \u010cis\u00e1rik worked with the Heraldic Commission of Ministry of the Interior to create new Slovak &lt;a href=\"national%20symbol\"&gt;national symbol&lt;/a&gt;s in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Velvet%20Revolution\"&gt;Velvet Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, including a new flag and &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;coat of arms&lt;/a&gt;. Working together, he and Ladislav Vrtel, an expert in &lt;a href=\"heraldry\"&gt;heraldry&lt;/a&gt;, created a new &lt;a href=\"Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Slovakia\"&gt;Coat of arms of Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; in 1990. Ladislav \u010cis\u00e1rik and Vrtel based their modern design, which includes a double cross, on an existing 14th century coat of arms. However, they chose to enlarge and triple the size of the double cross on their new coat of arms because they considered the cross to be a meaningful national symbol. \u010cis\u00e1rik and Vrtel also designed the &lt;a href=\"flag%20of%20Slovakia\"&gt;flag of Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;, which came into force on 3 September 1992, and the new presidential standard, both of which incorporate their coat of arms.\nIn 1994, Ladislav \u010cis\u00e1rik illustrated a guidebook called \"\"Najstar\u0161ie rody na Slovensku\" (\"Oldest Homes in Slovakia\"\"). He also released a map in poster format in 1996 which shows the official municipal flags and coats of arms for 136 cities in Slovakia.\nLadislav \u010cis\u00e1rik died on 3 August 2017, following a serious illness, at the age of 63. He was survived by his wife, Emilia Cisarikova."
