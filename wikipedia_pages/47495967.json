It was founded by Engin \u00d6nder who became disenchanted with the state of &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20media\"&gt;Turkish media&lt;/a&gt; on January 19, 2012. \u00d6nder, who started a &lt;a href=\"grassroots\"&gt;grassroots&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"citizen%20journalism\"&gt;citizen journalism&lt;/a&gt; movement, was later chosen as \u201cthe man transforming journalism in Turkey\u201d by &lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;TIME Magazine&lt;/a&gt; in 2015.\nFollowing a comprehensive revamp and repositioning, 140journos transformed itself from a citizen journalism organization to a professional &lt;a href=\"new%20media\"&gt;new media&lt;/a&gt; publisher that got popular among young generation with its own unique creative style in &lt;a href=\"journalism\"&gt;journalism&lt;/a&gt; with the creative lead of Berkant Akarcan, creative director at 140journos. 140journos produces original documentaries that include in-depth interviews on various &lt;a href=\"Political%20issues\"&gt;political&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Social%20issue\"&gt;social&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"economic%20issues\"&gt;economic issues&lt;/a&gt; by merging &lt;a href=\"Cinematography\"&gt;cinematographic&lt;/a&gt; storytelling with journalistic content. In addition to its popular new-age documentaries, 140journos publishes political articles, &lt;a href=\"e-book\"&gt;e-book&lt;/a&gt;s, organizes online/offline &lt;a href=\"debate\"&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; groups and develops open-source mobile/web applications that enable citizens to further engage with politics through technology.\nToday, 140journos has 1.5 million followers across &lt;a href=\"YouTube\"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Instagram\"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Facebook\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and employs 20 full-time employees consisting of senior and junior journalists, researchers, editors, &lt;a href=\"video%20editor\"&gt;video editor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"creative%20director\"&gt;creative director&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"art%20director\"&gt;art director&lt;/a&gt;s.\n81% of the followers are aged 18\u201334, which shows that 140journos is a major news outlet followed by &lt;a href=\"millennials\"&gt;millennials&lt;/a&gt;. As an &lt;a href=\"R%26amp%3BD\"&gt;R&amp;D&lt;/a&gt; experiment in journalism in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Media%20Age\"&gt;new media age&lt;/a&gt; through creative interventions, free interfaces and tools, 140journos finds new ways for &lt;a href=\"free%20expression\"&gt;free expression&lt;/a&gt;. 140journos has not only been producing content but also has developed a sustainable &lt;a href=\"business%20model\"&gt;business model&lt;/a&gt; through methods like advertising production for &lt;a href=\"brand\"&gt;brand&lt;/a&gt;s, content licensing, donations and ticketed entertainment shows that bring spotlight to journalistic content for more than 8 years in a country like &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, where difficulty of conducting free press activities has been recognized to be one of the hardest in the world.\n140journos' innovative approach to journalism has made them the subject matter of many case studies that have been conducted by prestigious institutions such as the &lt;a href=\"Nieman%20Lab\"&gt;Nieman Lab for Journalism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zeynep%20Tufekci\"&gt;Zeynep T\u00fcfek\u00e7i&lt;/a&gt; also devoted a portion of her book, \u201c&lt;a href=\"Twitter%20and%20Tear%20Gas\"&gt;Twitter and Tear Gas&lt;/a&gt;\u201d which is about protests in the age of &lt;a href=\"social%20media\"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, to inform the readers on how 140journos uses social media to disseminate news.\nHistory.\n140journos was first established as a citizen journalism platform broadcasting over Twitter in Turkey by Engin \u00d6nder. \u00d6nder tells that his intention was to find an innovative approach to circumventing &lt;a href=\"media%20blackout\"&gt;media blackout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Censorship%20in%20Turkey\"&gt;censorship&lt;/a&gt; by serving the Turkish public with crowdsourced and verified news as Turkey is ranked 157th out of 180 countries in the &lt;a href=\"World%20Press%20Freedom%20Index\"&gt;World Press Freedom Index&lt;/a&gt;, published by the media watchdog &lt;a href=\"Reporters%20Without%20Borders\"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;. The inspiration came after \u00d6nder observed how senior journalist Serdar Akinan covered the &lt;a href=\"Uludere%20massacre\"&gt;Uludere Massacre&lt;/a&gt;, where 34 civilians were killed, over social media after a media blackout in late 2011.\nThe publisher operates on social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, &lt;a href=\"WhatsApp\"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; and Twitter. The approach to publishing comes from an urge to understand and make people understand the nature of &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20society\"&gt;Turkish society&lt;/a&gt; by merging creativity with journalism. As of today, 140journos publishes their content mainly on YouTube where they have garnered more than 100 million views.\n140journos is derived from a combination of two references to &lt;a href=\"popular%20culture\"&gt;popular culture&lt;/a&gt;, 140 used to be the character limit on a Twitter post and \"journos\" means journalist. The Twitter account was created on January 19, 2012 during a memorial held in honor of &lt;a href=\"Hrant%20Dink\"&gt;Hrant Dink&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent journalist who was assassinated in 2007. It was founded by Engin Onder and his friends who were technologically literate but never had experience in the field of journalism.\nThe platform was designed to be an online outlet that \"citizen journalists\" would send over their content to be solicited, verified and disseminated by the 140journos editorial staff over the platform to be delivered to the Turkish public. The public contribution was limited but \u00d6nder and his friends would attend politically controversial hearings such as the KCK, &lt;a href=\"Ergenekon%20trials\"&gt;Ergenekon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"OdaTV\"&gt;OdaTV&lt;/a&gt; hearings to neutrally and impartially cover the trials and to publish news that the &lt;a href=\"mainstream%20media\"&gt;mainstream media&lt;/a&gt; was not reporting about.\nGezi Park protests were a turning point for 140journos as people turned to alternative media sources as they felt mainstream media weren't adequately covering the events that were taking place. The bipartisan coverage of the protests and curation of content increased the public trust in the platform. Gezi Park protests increased peoples' reliance on social media publishers as their source of information and the number of 140journos followers went up from 8.000 to 30.000 over 3 months.\nAfter Gezi Park protests 140journos became a grassroots organization that regularly pulled content from more than 250 volunteers across Turkey. According to Twitter analytics data from 2015, 140journos receives approximately 6 million monthly interactions and 200,000 daily interactions. With growing public interest towards citizen journalism, 140journos conducted citizen journalism workshops across Turkey with the coordination of universities, &lt;a href=\"Ngos\"&gt;NGOs&lt;/a&gt;, local municipalities. The workshops attracted a lot of interest and 140journos educated hundreds of college students on the intricacies of citizen journalism such as how to verify content. Some workshop attendees later on got jobs at 140journos as editors.\n140journos opens an &lt;a href=\"internship\"&gt;internship&lt;/a&gt; program during different stages of the year, but the most well known is the summer internship program. The internship program attracts a lot of students and graduates from leading colleges around Turkey. The internship program not only aims to find talent but aims to raise young journalists.\n140journos on Digital Platforms.\n140journos has produced documentaries for the Turkish streaming service BluTV. The documentaries include 2018-dated \"Paray\u0131 Vuranlar\", a docuseries consisting 3 episodes and \"S\u0131k\u0131\u015fm\u0131\u015fl\u0131k\", a &lt;a href=\"psychological%20thriller\"&gt;psychological thriller&lt;/a&gt; as a 6-episode docuseries in 2019.\nDirectors.\n140journos represents and works with the renowned war photographers such as \u00c7a\u011fda\u015f Erdo\u011fan and K\u00fcr\u015fad Bayhan.\nK\u00fcr\u015fad Bayhan is a former &lt;a href=\"War%20photography\"&gt;war photographer&lt;/a&gt; and has been working in active conflict zones since 2004.
