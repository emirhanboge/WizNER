They helped the Bills defense hold opposing teams without a 100-yard rusher for seventeen consecutive games in &lt;a href=\"1964%20AFL%20season\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1965%20AFL%20season\"&gt;1965&lt;/a&gt;, capturing &lt;a href=\"AFL%20championship\"&gt;AFL championship&lt;/a&gt;s in both years.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1964%20American%20Football%20League%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;1964 AFL Championship Game&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Chargers\"&gt;San Diego Chargers&lt;/a&gt;, Stratton made the memorable \"hit heard 'round the world\". San Diego's &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Lincoln\"&gt;Keith Lincoln&lt;/a&gt; had a 38-yard run on the game's opening play. The Chargers were leading 7\u20130 when Stratton drove his shoulder into Lincoln's midsection, breaking the star &lt;a href=\"running%20back\"&gt;running back&lt;/a&gt;'s ribs and knocking him out of the game. The Bills shut out San Diego for the rest of the game, and won 20\u20137. In the closing minutes of the first half with Buffalo leading 13\u20137, the Chargers drove to the Bills' 15, but Stratton &lt;a href=\"intercepted\"&gt;intercepted&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Tobin%20Rote\"&gt;Tobin Rote&lt;/a&gt; pass to end the threat. Rote and San Diego coach &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Gillman\"&gt;Sid Gillman&lt;/a&gt; called the turnover a decisive play.\nStratton played 11 seasons for the Bills before ending his career with the Chargers in 1973. He finished his career with 21 interceptions\u201418 with the Bills and 3 with the Chargers. He was selected to the &lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20League%20All-Time%20Team\"&gt;AFL All-Time Second Team&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater years.\nAfter football, Stratton became an executive with insurance company Crump Associates in &lt;a href=\"Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Knoxville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn March 25, 2020, Stratton died at age 78 from heart complications after a recent fall."
