    "text": "Benjamin West, (October 10, 1738 \u2013 March 11, 1820) was a &lt;a href=\"British-America\"&gt;British-America&lt;/a&gt;n artist who painted famous historical scenes such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Death%20of%20Nelson%20%28West%20painting%29\"&gt;The Death of Nelson&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Death%20of%20General%20Wolfe\"&gt;The Death of General Wolfe&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%28painting%29\"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Franklin%20Drawing%20Electricity%20from%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Benjamin Franklin Drawing Electricity from the Sky&lt;/a&gt;\".\nEntirely self-taught, West soon gained valuable patronage and toured Europe, eventually settling in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. He impressed &lt;a href=\"George%20III\"&gt;King George III&lt;/a&gt; and was largely responsible for the launch of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Royal Academy&lt;/a&gt;, of which he became the second president (after &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Joshua%20Reynolds\"&gt;Sir Joshua Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;). He was appointed historical painter to the court and &lt;a href=\"Surveyor%20of%20the%20Queen%27s%20Pictures\"&gt;Surveyor of the King's Pictures&lt;/a&gt;.\nWest also painted religious subjects, as in his huge work \"The Preservation of St Paul after a Shipwreck at Malta\", at the Chapel of St Peter and St Paul in Greenwich, and \"Christ Healing the Sick\", presented to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Gallery\"&gt;National Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nWest was born in &lt;a href=\"Springfield%20Township%2C%20Delaware%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Springfield, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20West%20Birthplace\"&gt;a house&lt;/a&gt; that is now in the borough of &lt;a href=\"Swarthmore%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Swarthmore&lt;/a&gt; on the campus of &lt;a href=\"Swarthmore%20College\"&gt;Swarthmore College&lt;/a&gt;, as the tenth child of an innkeeper and his wife. The family later moved to &lt;a href=\"Newtown%20Square%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Newtown Square, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, where his father was the proprietor of the &lt;a href=\"Square%20Tavern\"&gt;Square Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, still standing in that town.\nWest told the novelist &lt;a href=\"John%20Galt%20%28novelist%29\"&gt;John Galt&lt;/a&gt;, with whom, late in his life, he collaborated on a memoir, \"The Life and Studies of Benjamin West\" (1816, 1820), that, when he was a child, &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; showed him how to make paint by mixing some clay from the river bank with bear grease in a pot. West was an &lt;a href=\"autodidact\"&gt;autodidact&lt;/a&gt;; while excelling at the arts, \"he had little [formal] education and, even when president of the Royal Academy, could scarcely spell\". One day, his mother left him alone with his little sister Sally. Benjamin discovered some bottles of ink and began to paint Sally's portrait. When his mother came home, she noticed the painting, picked it up and said, \u201cWhy, it\u2019s Sally!\u201d and kissed him. Later, he noted, \"My mother's kiss made me a painter.\"\nFrom 1746 to 1759, West worked in Pennsylvania, mostly painting portraits. While West was in &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; in 1756, his patron, a gunsmith named &lt;a href=\"William%20Henry%20%28delegate%29\"&gt;William Henry&lt;/a&gt;, encouraged him to paint a \"Death of Socrates\" based on an engraving in &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Rollin\"&gt;Charles Rollin&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Ancient History.\" His resulting composition, which significantly differs from the source, has been called \"the most ambitious and interesting painting produced in colonial America\". &lt;a href=\"William%20Smith%20%28Anglican%20priest%29\"&gt;Dr William Smith&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"provost%20%28education%29\"&gt;provost&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Philadelphia\"&gt;College of Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, saw the painting in Henry's house and decided to become West's patron, offering him education and, more importantly, connections with wealthy and politically connected Pennsylvanians. During this time West met &lt;a href=\"John%20Wollaston%20%28painter%29\"&gt;John Wollaston&lt;/a&gt;, a famous painter who had immigrated from London. West learned Wollaston's techniques for painting the shimmer of silk and satin, and also adopted some of \"his mannerisms, the most prominent of which was to give all his subjects large almond-shaped eyes, which clients thought very chic\".\nAs brilliant as he was, West went unappreciated in America. In the eighteenth century, no American on the continent witnessed his Christ art.\nBlum, Edward J.; Harvey, Paul. The Color of Christ (pp. 53-54). The University of North Carolina Press. Kindle Edition. \nWest was a close friend of &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Franklin\"&gt;Benjamin Franklin&lt;/a&gt;, whose portrait he painted. Franklin was the godfather of West's second son, Benjamin.\nItalian \"Grand Tour\".\nSponsored by Smith and &lt;a href=\"William%20Allen%20%28loyalist%29\"&gt;William Allen&lt;/a&gt;, then reputed to be the wealthiest man in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, West traveled to &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; in 1760 in the company of the Scot William Patoun, a painter who later became an art collector. In common with many artists, architects, and lovers of the fine arts at that time he conducted a &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Tour\"&gt;Grand Tour&lt;/a&gt;. West expanded his repertoire by copying works of Italian painters such as &lt;a href=\"Titian\"&gt;Titian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raffaello%20Santi\"&gt;Raphael&lt;/a&gt; direct from the originals.\nIn Rome he met a number of international &lt;a href=\"Neoclassicism\"&gt;neo-classical&lt;/a&gt; artists including German-born &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Rafael%20Mengs\"&gt;Anton Rafael Mengs&lt;/a&gt;, Scottish &lt;a href=\"Gavin%20Hamilton%20%28artist%29\"&gt;Gavin Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, and Austrian &lt;a href=\"Angelica%20Kauffman\"&gt;Angelica Kauffman&lt;/a&gt;.\nEngland.\nIn August 1763, West arrived in England, on what he initially intended as a visit on his way back to America. In fact, he never returned to America. He stayed for a month at Bath with William Allen, who was also in the country, and visited his half-brother Thomas West at &lt;a href=\"Reading%2C%20Berkshire\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt; at the urging of his father. In London he was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wilson%20%28painter%29\"&gt;Richard Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and his student &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20Reynolds\"&gt;Joshua Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;. He moved into a house in Bedford Street, &lt;a href=\"Covent%20Garden\"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt;. The first picture he painted in England, \"Angelica and Medora\", along with a portrait of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Monckton\"&gt;General Monckton&lt;/a&gt;, and his \"Cymon and Iphigenia\", painted in Rome, were shown at the exhibition in Spring Gardens in 1764.\nIn 1765 he married Elizabeth Shewell, an American to whom he became engaged in Philadelphia, at &lt;a href=\"St%20Martin-in-the-Fields\"&gt;St Martin-in-the-Fields&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"William%20Markham%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;Dr Markham&lt;/a&gt;, then Headmaster of &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20School\"&gt;Westminster School&lt;/a&gt;, introduced West to &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Johnson\"&gt;Samuel Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Burke\"&gt;Edmund Burke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Newton\"&gt;Thomas Newton, Bishop of Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"James%20Johnson%20%28Bishop%20of%20Worcester%29\"&gt;James Johnson, Bishop of Worcester&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Hay%20Drummond\"&gt;Robert Hay Drummond&lt;/a&gt;, Archbishop of York. All three prelates commissioned work from him. In 1766 West proposed a scheme to decorate &lt;a href=\"St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral\"&gt;St Paul's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; with paintings. It was rejected by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Terrick\"&gt;the Bishop of London&lt;/a&gt;, but his idea of painting an altarpiece for &lt;a href=\"St%20Stephen%20Walbrook\"&gt;St Stephen Walbrook&lt;/a&gt; was accepted. At around this time he also received acclaim for his classical subjects, such as \"Orestes and Pylades\" and \"The Continence of Scipio\".\nBenjamin West was known in England as the \"American Raphael\". His Raphaelesque painting of \"Archangel Michael Binding the Devil\" is in the collection of &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Trinity College, Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;. He said that \"Art is the representation of human beauty, ideally perfect in design, graceful and noble in attitude.\"\nRoyal patronage.\nDrummond tried to raise subscriptions to fund an annuity for West, so that he could give up portraiture and devote himself entirely to more ambitious compositions. Having failed in this, he tried\u2014with greater success\u2014to convince King George III to patronise West. West was soon on good terms with the king, and the two men conducted long discussions on the state of art in England, including the idea of the establishment of a Royal Academy. The academy came into being in 1768, with West one of the primary leaders of an opposition group formed out of the existing &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Artists%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Society of Artists of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;; Joshua Reynolds was its first president. In the same year, he was elected to membership in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Philosophical%20Society\"&gt;American Philosophical Society&lt;/a&gt;. In a story related by &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Angelo\"&gt;Henry Angelo&lt;/a&gt; I (1756\u20131835) in his book of reminiscences, the actor &lt;a href=\"David%20Garrick\"&gt;David Garrick&lt;/a&gt;, who was a friend of Angelo's father, the Italian sword master &lt;a href=\"Domenico%20Angelo\"&gt;Domenico Angelo&lt;/a&gt;, memorably sketched for the teenaged Henry the following exchange: one day the painter &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Zuccarelli\"&gt;Francesco Zuccarelli&lt;/a&gt;, on one of his visits to Domenico, got into a dispute with his fellow royal academician &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Zoffany\"&gt;Johan Zoffany&lt;/a&gt; about the merit of West's 1769 painting \"The Departure of Regulus\", his first commission for the king. Zuccarelli exclaimed, \"Here is a painter who promises to rival &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20Poussin\"&gt;Nicolas Poussin&lt;/a&gt;\", while Zoffany tauntingly replied, \"A figo for Poussin, West has already beaten him out of the field.\"\nIn 1772, King George appointed him historical painter to the court at an annual fee of \u00a31,000. He painted a series of eight large canvases showing episodes from the life of &lt;a href=\"Edward%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward III&lt;/a&gt; for St George's Hall at &lt;a href=\"Windsor%20Castle\"&gt;Windsor Castle&lt;/a&gt;, and proposed a cycle of 36 works on the theme of \"the progress of revealed religion\" for a chapel at the castle, of which 28 were eventually executed. He also painted nine portraits of members of the royal family, including two of the king himself. He was &lt;a href=\"Surveyor%20of%20the%20King%27s%20Pictures\"&gt;Surveyor of the King's Pictures&lt;/a&gt; from 1791 until his death.\n\"The Death of General Wolfe\".\nWest painted his most famous, and possibly most influential painting, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Death%20of%20General%20Wolfe\"&gt;The Death of General Wolfe&lt;/a&gt;\", in 1770 and it exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1771. The painting became one of the most frequently reproduced images of the period. It returned to the &lt;a href=\"French%20and%20Indian%20War\"&gt;French and Indian War&lt;/a&gt; setting of his \"&lt;a href=\"General%20Johnson%20Saving%20a%20Wounded%20French%20Officer%20from%20the%20Tomahawk%20of%20a%20North%20American%20Indian\"&gt;General Johnson Saving a Wounded French Officer from the Tomahawk of a North American Indian&lt;/a&gt;\" of 1768. When the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolution\"&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt; broke out in 1776 he remained ambivalent, and neither spoke out for or against the Revolutionary War in his land of birth.\nWest became known for his large scale &lt;a href=\"history%20painting\"&gt;history painting&lt;/a&gt;s, which use expressive figures, colours and compositional schemes to help the spectator to identify with the scene represented. West called this \"&lt;a href=\"epic%20%28genre%29\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; representation\". His 1778 work \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20of%20the%20Boyne%20%28painting%29\"&gt;The Battle of the Boyne&lt;/a&gt;\" portrayed &lt;a href=\"William%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;William of Orange&lt;/a&gt;'s victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Boyne\"&gt;Battle of the Boyne&lt;/a&gt; in 1690, and strongly influenced subsequent images of William. In 1806 he produced \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Death%20of%20Nelson%20%28West%20painting%29\"&gt;The Death of Nelson&lt;/a&gt;\", to commemorate &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Nelson\"&gt;Horatio Nelson&lt;/a&gt;'s death at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Trafalgar\"&gt;Battle of Trafalgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater religious painting.\n&lt;a href=\"St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Birmingham\"&gt;St Paul's Church&lt;/a&gt;, in the Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham, has an important enamelled &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt; east window made in 1791 by &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Eginton\"&gt;Francis Eginton&lt;/a&gt;, modelled on an &lt;a href=\"altarpiece\"&gt;altarpiece&lt;/a&gt; painted c. 1786 by West, now in the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Dallas Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. It shows the &lt;a href=\"Conversion%20of%20Paul\"&gt;Conversion of Paul&lt;/a&gt;. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in 1791.\nWest is also well known for his huge work in the Chapel of St Peter and St Paul which now forms part of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Royal%20Naval%20College\"&gt;Old Royal Naval College&lt;/a&gt; in Greenwich, London. His work, \"The Preservation of St Paul after a Shipwreck at Malta\", measures 25\u00a0ft by 14\u00a0ft and illustrates the Acts of the Apostles: 27 &amp; 28. West also provided the designs for the other paintings executed by Biaggio Rebecca in the chapel.\nFollowing a loss of royal patronage at the beginning of the 19th century, West began a series of large-scale religious works. The first, \"Christ Healing the Sick\" was originally intended as a gift to &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Hospital\"&gt;Pennsylvania Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Philadelphia; instead he sold it to the British Institution for \u00a33,000, which in turn presented it to the National Gallery. West then made a copy to send to Philadelphia. The success of the picture led him to paint a series of even larger works, including his \"Death on the Pale Horse\", exhibited in 1817.\nRoyal Academy.\nThough initially snubbed by Sir Joshua Reynolds, founding President of the Royal Academy, and by some other Academicians who felt he was over-ambitious, West was elected President of the Royal Academy on the death of Reynolds in 1792. He resigned in 1805, to be replaced by a fierce rival, architect &lt;a href=\"James%20Wyatt\"&gt;James Wyatt&lt;/a&gt;. However West was again elected president the following year, and served until his death.\nPupils.\nMany American artists studied under him in London, including &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Earl\"&gt;Ralph Earl&lt;/a&gt; and later his son, &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Eleaser%20Whiteside%20Earl\"&gt;Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Morse\"&gt;Samuel Morse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Fulton\"&gt;Robert Fulton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Willson%20Peale\"&gt;Charles Willson Peale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rembrandt%20Peale\"&gt;Rembrandt Peale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20Pratt\"&gt;Matthew Pratt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Stuart\"&gt;Gilbert Stuart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Trumbull\"&gt;John Trumbull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Allston\"&gt;Washington Allston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Sully\"&gt;Thomas Sully&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Green%20%28painter%29\"&gt;John Green&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Abraham%20Delanoy\"&gt;Abraham Delanoy&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nWest died at his house in Newman Street, London, on March 11, 1820, and was buried in &lt;a href=\"St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral\"&gt;St Paul's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. He had been offered a &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;hood by the British Crown, but declined it, believing that he should instead be made a &lt;a href=\"Peerage\"&gt;peer&lt;/a&gt;."
