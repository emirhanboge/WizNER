    "text": "Club Deportivo Armenio is a &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club from &lt;a href=\"Ingeniero%20Maschwitz\"&gt;Ingeniero Maschwitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Greater Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. The team currently plays in the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;Primera B Metropolitana&lt;/a&gt;, which is the regionalised third division of the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Argentine football league system&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1962 under the name \"Club Armenio de F\u00fatbol\" by the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20people\"&gt;Armenian&lt;/a&gt; community in Argentina. It changed its name in 1968, and was affiliated to the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Argentine Football Association&lt;/a&gt; two years later. The original colours were black and white, but first changed to green and white stripes and then again to red and white. Nowadays, home uniform is red, orange and blue, inspired by the &lt;a href=\"flag%20of%20Armenia\"&gt;flag of Armenia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first official title won by Armenio was the 1972 &lt;a href=\"Primera%20D\"&gt;Primera D&lt;/a&gt; championship, therefore promoting to the upper division, &lt;a href=\"Primera%20C\"&gt;Primera C&lt;/a&gt;. Only four years later, the squad won another championship and promoted to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;Primera B&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1986\u201387 season of the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Nacional\"&gt;Primera B Nacional&lt;/a&gt; (second division), Deportivo Armenio broke the division's record of most matches without losing, with a run of 38 games without defeat. The team's coach at that time was Alberto Parseghian (former goalkeeper of the team and of other Argentine clubs), and the captain was Miguel Gardarian. Following this successful run, the club gained promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; (first division). Their highest ever finish in the top division was 13th in the &lt;a href=\"1987%E2%80%9388%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1987\u201388 season&lt;/a&gt;, followed by relegation the season after (the &lt;a href=\"1988%E2%80%9389%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1988\u201389&lt;/a&gt;).\nA notable game in the club's history was a 3\u20132 away win against &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate\"&gt;River Plate&lt;/a&gt; in the 1987\u201388 season, after being 0\u20132 down. On that day, the 3 goals were scored by Ra\u00fal Wensel. Another important victory was in the same season against &lt;a href=\"Boca%20Juniors\"&gt;Boca Juniors&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"La%20Bombonera\"&gt;La Bombonera&lt;/a&gt;. Armenio won that day 1\u20130 with a goal scored by &lt;a href=\"Silvano%20Maciel\"&gt;Silvano Maciel&lt;/a&gt;. This match was the last one in &lt;a href=\"Hugo%20Gatti\"&gt;Hugo Gatti&lt;/a&gt;'s (Boca's goalkeeper) career, as the team's coach (&lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Omar%20Pastoriza\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Omar Pastoriza&lt;/a&gt;) took him out of the starting lineup for his mistake in Maciel's goal."
