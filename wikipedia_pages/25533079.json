    "text": "Moti Gitik () is a mathematician, working in &lt;a href=\"set%20theory\"&gt;set theory&lt;/a&gt;, who is professor at the &lt;a href=\"Tel-Aviv%20University\"&gt;Tel-Aviv University&lt;/a&gt;. He was an &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20International%20Congresses%20of%20Mathematicians%20Plenary%20and%20Invited%20Speakers\"&gt;invited speaker&lt;/a&gt; at the 2002 &lt;a href=\"International%20Congresses%20of%20Mathematicians\"&gt;International Congresses of Mathematicians&lt;/a&gt;, and became a fellow of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Mathematical%20Society\"&gt;American Mathematical Society&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.\nResearch.\nGitik proved the &lt;a href=\"relative%20consistency\"&gt;consistency&lt;/a&gt; of \"all uncountable cardinals are &lt;a href=\"singular%20cardinal\"&gt;singular&lt;/a&gt;\" (a strong negation of the &lt;a href=\"axiom%20of%20choice\"&gt;axiom of choice&lt;/a&gt;) from the consistency of \"there is a proper class of &lt;a href=\"strongly%20compact%20cardinal\"&gt;strongly compact cardinal&lt;/a&gt;s\". He further proved the &lt;a href=\"equiconsistency\"&gt;equiconsistency&lt;/a&gt; of the following statements: \nGitik discovered several methods for building models of ZFC with complicated Cardinal Arithmetic structure. His main results deal with consistency and equi-consistency of non-trivial patterns\u00a0 of the Power Function over singular cardinals."
