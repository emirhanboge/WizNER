    "text": "Paul Haenlein (17 October 1835 in &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 27 January 1905 in &lt;a href=\"Mainz\"&gt;Mainz&lt;/a&gt;) was a German engineer and flight pioneer. He flew in a semi-rigid-frame &lt;a href=\"dirigible\"&gt;dirigible&lt;/a&gt;. His family belonged to the \"Citoyens notables\", those notabilities who led the economy, administration and culture of Mainz.\nHaenlein received an education as a &lt;a href=\"mechanical%20engineering\"&gt;mechanical engineer&lt;/a&gt; and pattern maker. He studied at the &lt;a href=\"Technische%20Hochschule\"&gt;Technische Hochschule&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karlsruhe\"&gt;Karlsruhe&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently he worked as graduated civil engineer for different factories. He was the first to create a dirigible &lt;a href=\"airship\"&gt;airship&lt;/a&gt; which was powered by an &lt;a href=\"internal%20combustion%20engine\"&gt;internal combustion engine&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=\"Etienne%20Lenoir\"&gt;Lenoir&lt;/a&gt;-type motor obtained its fuel from the gas in the balloon. It had four horizontal cylinders, which delivered about with a consumption of approximately of gas per hour. With a mass of 233\u00a0kg and an &lt;a href=\"engine%20displacement\"&gt;engine displacement&lt;/a&gt; of 19.2 L it delivered a continuous &lt;a href=\"Power%20%28physics%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; of 2.7\u00a0kW. The gas was sucked from the envelope of the balloon, which was kept fully inflated by pumping in compensating air to the air bags inside the main envelope. Due to the consumption of gas, the &lt;a href=\"Lift%20%28force%29\"&gt;lifting force&lt;/a&gt; decreased, so the range of the airship had been limited.\nIn 1872 Haenlein obtained a U.S. patent (No. 130 915) to use the otherwise wasted gas in the dirigible's engines. On 13 December, Paul Haenlein tested the first &lt;a href=\"airship\"&gt;airship&lt;/a&gt; with a gas engine in &lt;a href=\"Brno\"&gt;Br\u00fcnn&lt;/a&gt;, achieving 19\u00a0km/h. This airship was a direct forerunner of the Lebaudy type, in length, greatest diameter, and with a cubic capacity of . The airship achieved 19\u00a0km/h. The tests were stopped later, because of a shortage of money.\nA propeller of in diameter was driven by the Lenoir engine with 40 revolutions per minute. This was the first instance of the use of an internal combustion engine in connection with aeronautical experiments.\nThe envelope of the dirigible was rendered &lt;a href=\"airtight\"&gt;airtight&lt;/a&gt; by means of an internal &lt;a href=\"rubber\"&gt;rubber&lt;/a&gt; coating, with a thinner film on the outside. &lt;a href=\"Syngas\"&gt;Syngas&lt;/a&gt;, used for inflation, formed a suitable fuel for the engine, but limited the height to which the dirigible could ascend. Such trials as were made were carried out with the dirigible held captive. A full experiment was prevented because funds ran low, but Haenlein's work constituted a distinct advance on all that had been done previously.\nThis engine type had the disadvantage of requiring either a gas-producer or a large storage capacity for the gas, either of which makes the total weight of the power plant much greater than that of a petrol engine."
