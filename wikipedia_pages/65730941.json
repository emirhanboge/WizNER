    "text": "Slavery in France, and, by extension, the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20France\"&gt;French Empire&lt;/a&gt;, covers a wide range of disparate topics. Some of the most notable ones include:\nSlavery in Merovingian France.\nIn 486 &lt;a href=\"Clovis%20I\"&gt;Clovis I&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Childeric, defeated &lt;a href=\"Syagrius\"&gt;Syagrius&lt;/a&gt;, a Roman military leader who competed with the &lt;a href=\"Merovingian%20dynasty\"&gt;Merovingians&lt;/a&gt; for power in northern France. &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20Merovingian%20France\"&gt;Slavery in Merovingian France&lt;/a&gt; includes Merovingian Slave Queens, several &lt;a href=\"Franks\"&gt;Frankish queens&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Merovingian%20dynasty\"&gt;Merovingian dynasty&lt;/a&gt; who were formerly slaves. \nOnly five slave queens have been identified in &lt;a href=\"Merovingian%20France\"&gt;Merovingian France&lt;/a&gt;, though there may be more: &lt;a href=\"Ingund\"&gt;Ingund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fredegund\"&gt;Fredegund&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bilichild\"&gt;Bilichild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nanthild\"&gt;Nanthild&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Balthild\"&gt;Balthild&lt;/a&gt;. Slavery continued during the &lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20Empire\"&gt;Carolingian Empire&lt;/a&gt;\nFirst abolition of slavery and serfdom in France.\nIn 1198 the &lt;a href=\"Trinitarians\"&gt;Trinitarians&lt;/a&gt; was founded by &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Matha\"&gt;John of Matha&lt;/a&gt; with the purpose of ransoming war captive &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Muslims\"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Crusades\"&gt;Crusades&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Louis%20IX\"&gt;Louis IX&lt;/a&gt; installed a house of their order in his ch\u00e2teau of Fontainebleau. He chose Trinitarians as his chaplains, and was accompanied by them on his crusades. The Master of the Trinity was taken captive together with Saint Louis after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Al%20Mansurah\"&gt;Battle of Al Mansurah&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1315 &lt;a href=\"Louis%20X%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis X&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, publishes a decree abolishing &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; and proclaiming that \"France signifies freedom\", that any slave setting foot on French ground should be freed. However some limited cases of slavery continued until the 17th century in some of France's Mediterranean harbours in &lt;a href=\"Provence\"&gt;Provence&lt;/a&gt;, as well as until the 18th century in some of &lt;a href=\"Overseas%20France\"&gt;France's overseas territories&lt;/a&gt;. Most aspects of serfdom are also eliminated de facto between 1315 and 1318. Louis X died two years after this events. In 1318 King &lt;a href=\"Philip%20V%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip V&lt;/a&gt; abolishes &lt;a href=\"serfdom\"&gt;serfdom&lt;/a&gt; in his domain.\nSlavery in French colonies.\n&lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;French colonial empire&lt;/a&gt; practiced slavery in its &lt;a href=\"colonies\"&gt;colonies&lt;/a&gt;; in &lt;a href=\"New%20France\"&gt;New France&lt;/a&gt;, and also in the rest of its colonies. In the mid 16th century, enslaved people were trafficked from Africa to the Caribbean by European mercantilists.\n&lt;a href=\"French%20West%20India%20Company\"&gt;French West India Company&lt;/a&gt; developed Tobacco plantations in French colonies, the company got a monopoly on the slave trade from &lt;a href=\"Senegal\"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;, which since 1658 belonged to the \"Company of Cape Verde and Senegal\". Slave trade continued operated by &lt;a href=\"Compagnie%20du%20S%C3%A9n%C3%A9gal\"&gt;Compagnie du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal&lt;/a&gt; 1658 to 1709, They traded slaves with the &lt;a href=\"Hausa%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Hausa Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, Mali, and the Moors in Mauritania.\nAs of 1778, the French were trafficking approximately 13,000 African people as slaves to the &lt;a href=\"French%20West%20Indies\"&gt;French West Indies&lt;/a&gt; each year. While slavery had been active in French colonies since the early 16th century, it was theoretically not legitimized by the French government until the Revolutionary convention in 1794.\nSlavery in New France.\nSlavery was practiced by &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; colony of &lt;a href=\"New%20France\"&gt;New France&lt;/a&gt;, by 1750, two thirds of the enslaved peoples in New France were indigenous, and by 1834, most enslaved people were &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlave trade.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Nantes\"&gt;Nantes&lt;/a&gt; played a main &lt;a href=\"Role%20of%20Nantes%20in%20the%20slave%20trade\"&gt;role of in the slave trade&lt;/a&gt;.\nCode Noir.\nIn 1685 &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20French%20monarchs\"&gt;French King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV\"&gt;Louis XIV&lt;/a&gt; passed the decree known as &lt;a href=\"Code%20Noir\"&gt;Code Noir&lt;/a&gt; (, \"Black Code\"). The code defined the conditions of &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;French colonial empire&lt;/a&gt;. \nSecond abolition of slavery in France.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20the%20Friends%20of%20the%20Blacks\"&gt;Society of the Friends of the Blacks&lt;/a&gt; was founded in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; in 1788, and remained active until 1793, during the midst of the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. It was led by &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Pierre%20Brissot\"&gt;Jacques Pierre Brissot&lt;/a&gt;, who frequently received advice from British abolitionist &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Clarkson\"&gt;Thomas Clarkson&lt;/a&gt;, who led the &lt;a href=\"Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;abolitionist movement&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of 1789, the Society had 141 members.\nThe second general abolition of slavery took place in on 4 February 1794, when slavery was abolished in all French territories and possessions, during the &lt;a href=\"National%20Convention\"&gt;convention&lt;/a&gt;, the first elected Assembly of the &lt;a href=\"French%20First%20Republic\"&gt;First Republic&lt;/a&gt; (1792\u20131804), under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Maximilien%20Robespierre\"&gt;Maximilien Robespierre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Law%20of%204%20February%201794\"&gt;abolished slavery in law&lt;/a&gt; in France and its colonies. &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Gr%C3%A9goire\"&gt;Abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire&lt;/a&gt; and the Society of the Friends of the Blacks were part of the abolitionist movement, which had laid important groundwork in building anti-slavery sentiment in the &lt;a href=\"metropole\"&gt;metropole&lt;/a&gt;. The first article of the law stated that \"Slavery was abolished\" in the French colonies, while the second article stated that \"slave-owners would be indemnified\" with financial compensation for the value of their slaves. The French constitution passed in 1795 included in the declaration of the Rights of Man that slavery was abolished. \nRe-introduction of slavery in France.\nIn 1802, Napoleon re-introduced slavery in sugarcane-growing colonies, it lasted 13 years and ended in 1815.\nEnd of slavery in France.\nIn 1815, Napoleon abolished the slave trade. In 1815, The &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; declared its opposition to the slave trade. In 1818, the slave trade was banned in France. On July 18\u201319, 1845, the &lt;a href=\"Mackau%20Law\"&gt;Mackau Laws&lt;/a&gt; were passed, which paved the way towards the &lt;a href=\"abolition%20of%20slavery\"&gt;abolition of slavery&lt;/a&gt; in France. \nOn April 27, 1848, the &lt;a href=\"Proclamation%20of%20the%20Abolition%20of%20Slavery%20in%20the%20French%20Colonies%2C%2027%20April%201848\"&gt;Proclamation of the Abolition of Slavery in the French Colonies&lt;/a&gt; was made. The effective abolition was enacted with the . Gabon was founded as a settlement for emancipated slaves.\nModern day.\nEven when slavery have been prohibited for more than one century, many criminal organization have being practicing &lt;a href=\"human%20trafficking\"&gt;human trafficking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Trade\"&gt;slave trade&lt;/a&gt;. For this reason on July 25, 2013, France recognized modern-day slavery as a crime punishable by up to 30 years in jail."
