    "text": "Manolete, also known as The Passion Within in the United Kingdom, Blood and Passion in Canada, and A Matador's Mistress in the United States, is a 2008 &lt;a href=\"biopic\"&gt;biopic&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"bullfighter\"&gt;bullfighter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Manolete\"&gt;Manuel Laureano Rodr\u00edguez S\u00e1nchez&lt;/a&gt;, better known as \"Manolete\". The film was written and directed by &lt;a href=\"Menno%20Meyjes\"&gt;Menno Meyjes&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first film from &lt;a href=\"HandMade%20Films\"&gt;HandMade Films&lt;/a&gt; since \"&lt;a href=\"Lock%2C%20Stock%20and%20Two%20Smoking%20Barrels\"&gt;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&lt;/a&gt;\" (1998).\nPlot.\nThe Menno Meyjes directed drama stars &lt;a href=\"Adrien%20Brody\"&gt;Adrien Brody&lt;/a&gt; as Spanish bullfighter &lt;a href=\"Manolete\"&gt;Manolete&lt;/a&gt;, in a film that covers his late life love affair with actress &lt;a href=\"Lupe%20Sino\"&gt;Lupe Sino&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Pen%C3%A9lope%20Cruz\"&gt;Pen\u00e9lope Cruz&lt;/a&gt;) before he was gored to death in the bull ring. Sino's &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; politics turned their affair into a scandal in the early 1940s, especially after discovering her previous marriage to a &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Spain\"&gt;PCE&lt;/a&gt; member. The film begins with Manolete's last day in &lt;a href=\"Linares%2C%20Ja%C3%A9n\"&gt;Linares&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelease.\nThe film premiered on 28 August 2008 in the &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Toronto International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite a planned release date of 2007, the film faced several production delays and a spiralling budget. Although it was scheduled for a theatrical release in France on 31 March 2010, Deadline's Mike Fleming reported that, \"Even though the film stars two Oscar winners, it never found any takers for a theatrical run.\" The film has been shelved since 2007.\nIn April 2011 - Xenon Pictures CEO Leigh Savidge announced that on 7 June 2011 Xenon Pictures would release a newly edited version of \"A Matador's Mistress\" on DVD.\nGravitas Ventures announced on 14 March 2011 that it has acquired &lt;a href=\"Video%20on%20demand\"&gt;VOD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"digital%20rights\"&gt;digital rights&lt;/a&gt; to \"Manolete\". Gravitas, which is licensing the film from Viva Pictures, plans to release the film on demand via &lt;a href=\"cable%20television\"&gt;cable&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"satellite%20television\"&gt;satellite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Telecommunications%20company\"&gt;telco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"online\"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; in June 2011. \"We are confident no one is better positioned to exploit this epic high-value production on a digital platform,\" said Viva president Victor Elizalde.\nControversy.\nAlthough bullfighting scenes were shot expensively without bulls, animal rights activists have encouraged a boycott of the film. Protestors reject what they perceive to be a glamorous image of a matador on film. \"It is inadmissible to release a film in which the hero is a matador,\" said the Alliance Anticorrida, a French anti-bullfighting group, in a message to its 20,000 members. \"If they are properly informed, a great number of spectators will avoid this new film.\"\nFilming locations.\nThe film was shot in 2005, four years before Cruz won her Oscar for Vicky Cristina Barcelona."
