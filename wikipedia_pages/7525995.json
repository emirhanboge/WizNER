    "text": "Harry Norris (12 June 1888 \u2013 15 December 1966) was an Australian &lt;a href=\"architect\"&gt;architect&lt;/a&gt;, one of the more prolific and successful in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; in the interwar period, best known for his 1930s &lt;a href=\"Art%20Deco\"&gt;Art Deco&lt;/a&gt; commercial work in the Melbourne CBD.\nHis designs were informed by his regular overseas trips, especially to the United States, which he visited at least every 18 months from perhaps the late 1920s; and he was one of the first architects to introduce the Art Deco style to major commercial projects.\nHe had a strong and long relationship with the wealthy Nicholas family, designing not only the &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Building\"&gt;Nicholas Building&lt;/a&gt;, but the Aspro factory in South Melbourne, the spectacular mansion '&lt;a href=\"Burnham%20Beeches%2C%20Sherbooke\"&gt;Burnham Beeches&lt;/a&gt;' in the Dandenongs for Alfred Nicholas, and various additions and alterations to &lt;a href=\"Wesley%20College%20%28Victoria%29\"&gt;Wesley College&lt;/a&gt; following a bequest from the family. He also had a long relationship with &lt;a href=\"George%20Coles%20%28entrepreneur%29\"&gt;G. J. Coles&lt;/a&gt;, designing branches of their eponymous Coles Stores from the late 1920s, numerous matching Art Deco branches in the 1930s, and some of their earliest supermarkets in the 1950s, as well as a country house for E. B. Coles in 1938. He refused membership of the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Institute%20of%20Architects\"&gt;RVIA&lt;/a&gt; for many years until finally joining on the 21 February 1946. Harry Norris retired on his 78th birthday in June 1966 and died six months later.\nNotable Projects.\nNicholas Building\nAddress: 27-41 &lt;a href=\"Swanston%20Street%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Swanston Street&lt;/a&gt;\nDate of construction: 1925\u201326, 1939\u201340 (extension)\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nicholas%20Building\"&gt;The Nicholas Building&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most distinctive interwar office blocks in Melbourne.
