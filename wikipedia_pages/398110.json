    "text": "The Ballon d'Or (; \"Golden Ball\") is an annual &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; award presented by French news magazine \"&lt;a href=\"France%20Football\"&gt;France Football&lt;/a&gt;\". It has been awarded since 1956, although between 2010 and 2015, an agreement was made with &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt;, and the award was temporarily merged with the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;FIFA World Player of the Year&lt;/a&gt; (founded in 1991) and known as the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Ballon%20d%27Or\"&gt;FIFA Ballon d'Or&lt;/a&gt;. However, the partnership ended in 2016, and the award reverted to the Ballon d'Or, while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award &lt;a href=\"The%20Best%20FIFA%20Men%27s%20Player\"&gt;The Best FIFA Men's Player&lt;/a&gt;. The recipients of the joint FIFA Ballon d'Or are considered as winners by both award organisations.\nConceived by sports writer &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Hanot\"&gt;Gabriel Hanot&lt;/a&gt;, the Ballon d'Or award honours the male player deemed to have performed the best over the previous year, based on voting by football journalists, from 1956 to 2006. After 2007, coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote. Originally, it was awarded only to players from Europe and widely known as the European Footballer of the Year award. In 1995, the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players from any origin that have been active at European clubs. The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Matthews\"&gt;Stanley Matthews&lt;/a&gt; of England was the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or. Prior to 2007, the award was generally known as the continental European Footballer of the Year award in English language and much international media. Even after 2007, it was usually identified with and referred to by that name because of its origin as a European award, until it was merged with FIFA's World Player award cementing its new worldwide claim. Liberia's &lt;a href=\"George%20Weah\"&gt;George Weah&lt;/a&gt;, the only African recipient, became the first non-European to win the award in 1995, the year that rules of eligibility were changed for the first time. &lt;a href=\"Ronaldo%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29\"&gt;Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; of Brazil became the first South American winner two years later. The second rule change in 2007 to include players from all continents did not bring up new winners, as all recipients since then have still exclusively been active in Europe during their win.\n&lt;a href=\"Lionel%20Messi\"&gt;Lionel Messi&lt;/a&gt; has won the award a record seven times, followed by &lt;a href=\"Cristiano%20Ronaldo\"&gt;Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; with five. Three players have won the award three times each: &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Cruyff\"&gt;Johan Cruyff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Platini\"&gt;Michel Platini&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Marco%20van%20Basten\"&gt;Marco van Basten&lt;/a&gt;. With seven awards each, Dutch, German, Argentine and Portuguese players have won the most Ballons d'Or. Players from Germany (1972, 1981) and the Netherlands (1988) were the only to take all three top spots in one year, with German (1972) and especially Italian clubs (1988\u20131990) achieving the same feat, including two years solely made up of &lt;a href=\"AC%20Milan\"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt; players (1988, 1989), a unique record until Spanish clubs experienced an unforeseen dominance (2009\u20132012, 2015, 2016) and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; (2010) became the second club with three top players. Two Spanish clubs, Barcelona and &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20CF\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, also lead the ranking for employing the most winners, with twelve and eleven wins.\nBetween 2010 and 2015 inclusive, the award was merged with a similar one, the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;FIFA World Player of the Year&lt;/a&gt; award, to create the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Ballon%20d%27Or\"&gt;FIFA Ballon d'Or&lt;/a&gt;, which was awarded to the world's best male player before FIFA and \"France Football\" decided not to continue the merging agreement. After 2011, &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Best%20Player%20in%20Europe%20Award\"&gt;UEFA Best Player in Europe Award&lt;/a&gt; to maintain the tradition of the original Ballon d'Or of specifically honouring a football player from Europe.\nEight players (&lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Charlton\"&gt;Bobby Charlton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Beckenbauer\"&gt;Franz Beckenbauer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gerd%20M%C3%BCller\"&gt;Gerd M\u00fcller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Rossi\"&gt;Paolo Rossi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zinedine%20Zidane\"&gt;Zinedine Zidane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rivaldo\"&gt;Rivaldo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ronaldinho\"&gt;Ronaldinho&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kak%C3%A1\"&gt;Kak\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;) have won the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the European Cup/&lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, and the Ballon d'Or during their careers.\nThe award shows a bias in favor of attacking players, which has increased in recent decades. Over time, the award has gone to a more exclusive set of leagues and clubs. Prior to 1995, 10 leagues supplied Ballon d'Or winners, whereas only England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have supplied winners since 1995. Spain's La Liga has the most Ballon d'Or winners. Barcelona and Real Madrid have supplied the most Ballon d'Or winners since 1995.\nIn 2020, the Group L'\u00c9quipe, to which France Football belongs, decided that no award would be given for the year due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; cutting short the seasons of football clubs worldwide.\nWinners.\nWins by player.\nNote: One-time winners are only included if they have also finished second or third in another year. \nAdditional awards.\nAn honorary award, under the name Super Ballon d'Or, was awarded to &lt;a href=\"Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano\"&gt;Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano&lt;/a&gt; in 1989, after he surpassed &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Cruyff\"&gt;Johan Cruyff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Platini\"&gt;Michel Platini&lt;/a&gt; in \"France Football\"s voting.\nA decade later, \"France Football\" elected &lt;a href=\"Pel%C3%A9\"&gt;Pel\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; the Football Player of the Century after consulting their former Ballon d'Or recipients. Among the 34 previous winners, 30 cast their votes, while &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Matthews\"&gt;Stanley Matthews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Omar%20S%C3%ADvori\"&gt;Omar S\u00edvori&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20Best\"&gt;George Best&lt;/a&gt; abstained, and &lt;a href=\"Lev%20Yashin\"&gt;Lev Yashin&lt;/a&gt; had died. Each voter was allotted five votes worth up to five points; however, Di St\u00e9fano only chose a first place, Platini a first and second place, and &lt;a href=\"George%20Weah\"&gt;George Weah&lt;/a&gt; two players for fifth place. Pel\u00e9 was named the greatest by 17 voters, receiving almost double the number of points earned by the runner-up, &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Maradona\"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Ballon d'Or in 2016, \"France Football\" published a reevaluation of the awards presented before 1995, when only European players were eligible to win the award. 12 out of the 39 Ballons d'Or presented during this time period would have been awarded to South American players; in addition to Pel\u00e9 and Diego Maradona, &lt;a href=\"Garrincha\"&gt;Garrincha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mario%20Kempes\"&gt;Mario Kempes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rom%C3%A1rio\"&gt;Rom\u00e1rio&lt;/a&gt; were retrospectively recognized as worthy winners. The original recipients, however, remain unchanged.\nMaradona and Pel\u00e9 also received honorary Ballons d'Ors for their services to football in &lt;a href=\"1995%20Ballon%20d%27Or\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2013%20FIFA%20Ballon%20d%27Or\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, respectively."
