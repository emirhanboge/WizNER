    "text": "Veikko Huovinen (7 May 1927 \u2013 4 October 2009) was a &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20language\"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"novelist\"&gt;novelist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"forester\"&gt;forester&lt;/a&gt;. As a novelist, his writing was known for its realism, pacifism, sharp intellect, and peculiar humor. He wrote 37 books, and one of his best-known humorous novels is \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sheep%20Eaters\"&gt;The Sheep Eaters&lt;/a&gt;\" from 1970. One of his books, the 1980 novel \"Dog Nail Clipper\" was adapted into a critically well-received 2004 film of &lt;a href=\"Dog%20Nail%20Clipper\"&gt;the same name&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nHuovinen was born in &lt;a href=\"Simo%2C%20Finland\"&gt;Simo, Finland&lt;/a&gt;. When he was six months old, his family moved to &lt;a href=\"Sotkamo\"&gt;Sotkamo&lt;/a&gt;, where he lived until his death. As a child, Huovinen was known as well-mannered, yet he had a reputation for outlandish stories and occasional mischief. He went to high school in &lt;a href=\"Kajaani\"&gt;Kajaani&lt;/a&gt;, but his studies were interrupted in 1944 when he served as a volunteer AA gunner in the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Army\"&gt;Finnish Army&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated after the war in 1946, enrolling in the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Helsinki\"&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;, from where he graduated with a M.A. in forestry in 1952.\nHuovinen worked as a forester from 1953 to 1956, until becoming a full-time author. In 1999, he was awarded an honorary professorship for his services to Finnish literature. He was married and had 3 children.\nLiterary career.\nHuovinen started writing in 1949 when working in a fire watch post in &lt;a href=\"Vuokatti\"&gt;Vuokatti&lt;/a&gt;. His first short story collection, \"Hirri\" was published in 1950, followed by the novel \"Havukka-ahon Ajattelija\" in 1952. Both of these concern the life and its peculiarities in the Kainuu region in Finland, written in a unique style of humor and characterized by their inventive use of language. The main character in \"Havukka-ahon Ajattelija\", Konsta Pylkk\u00e4nen, has since become ingrained into Finnish modern folklore as the archetype of a rustic, backwoods philosopher.\nHuovinen's further works never strayed far from humor, but started to exhibit the author's pacifistic philosophies and later took a turn towards black humor. A good example of such is the trilogy, referred by the author as \"Three devilish mustached men\"; \"&lt;a href=\"Veitikka\"&gt;Veitikka \u2013 A. Hitlerin el\u00e4m\u00e4 ja teot&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Joe-set\u00e4\" and \"Pietari Suuri hatun polki\", concerning &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Great\"&gt;Peter the Great&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\n\"Veitikka\" prompted some controversy at the time, as it portrays Hitler in a humoristic light. Huovinen countered the claims of impropriety by contending that by laughing at dictators, one strips them of their power to influence people. \"Veitikka\" is ostensibly a researched study into the character of Hitler, but the totally outlandish stories quickly betray the book as a work of fiction. The two subsequent books follow the same pattern of telling a ridiculous history of the dictators while letting the author lament the effects such people have on mankind.\nHuovinen's 1980 novel \"Koirankynnen leikkaaja\" (&lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;translation&lt;/a&gt;: \"Dog Nail Clipper\") was adapted into a 2004 film of &lt;a href=\"Dog%20Nail%20Clipper\"&gt;the same name&lt;/a&gt;, directed by &lt;a href=\"Markku%20P%C3%B6l%C3%B6nen\"&gt;Markku P\u00f6l\u00f6nen&lt;/a&gt; and starred by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Franz%C3%A9n\"&gt;Peter Franz\u00e9n&lt;/a&gt;. In spite of low profits, the film was critically acclaimed receiving positive reviews and winning several major film awards. \"Dog Nail Clipper\" was the most successful film at the 2005 &lt;a href=\"Jussi%20Award\"&gt;Jussi Award&lt;/a&gt;s winning in five categories including Best Film, Best Actor, and Best Direction."
