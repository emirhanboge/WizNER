    "text": "Maputo (), officially named Louren\u00e7o Marques until 1976, is the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20city\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; and most populous city of &lt;a href=\"Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;. The city is named after chief Maputsu I of the Tembe clan, a subgroup of the &lt;a href=\"Tsonga%20people\"&gt;Tsonga people&lt;/a&gt;. Located near the southern end of the country, it is positioned within 120 &lt;a href=\"Kilometre\"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; (75 miles) of the &lt;a href=\"Eswatini\"&gt;Eswatini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; borders. The city has a population of 1,088,449 (as of 2017) distributed over a land area of 347.69 &lt;a href=\"Square%20kilometre\"&gt;km2&lt;/a&gt; (134 &lt;a href=\"Square%20mile\"&gt;sq mi&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Maputo\"&gt;Maputo metropolitan area&lt;/a&gt; includes the neighbouring city of &lt;a href=\"Matola\"&gt;Matola&lt;/a&gt;, and has a total population of 2,717,437. Maputo is a &lt;a href=\"port%20city\"&gt;port city&lt;/a&gt;, with an economy centered on commerce. It is also noted for its vibrant cultural scene and distinctive, eclectic architecture.\nMaputo is situated on &lt;a href=\"Maputo%20Bay\"&gt;a large natural bay&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, near where the rivers Tembe, Mbuluzi, Matola and Infulene converge. The city consists of seven administrative divisions, which are each subdivided into &lt;a href=\"Quarter%20%28urban%20subdivision%29\"&gt;quarters&lt;/a&gt; or \"bairros\". The city is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Maputo%20Province\"&gt;Maputo Province&lt;/a&gt;, but is administered as a self-contained, separate &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Mozambique\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; since 1998. Maputo City is the geographically smallest and most densely populated province in Mozambique. Maputo is a &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Acosmopolitan\"&gt;cosmopolitan&lt;/a&gt; city, with &lt;a href=\"Bantu%20languages\"&gt;Bantu&lt;/a&gt;, Tsonga languages being more common, &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20language\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, and, to a lesser extent, &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20language\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20language\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; languages and cultures present.\nThe area on which Maputo stands was first settled as a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20village\"&gt;fishing village&lt;/a&gt; by ancient Tsonga people. It was soon named Louren\u00e7o Marques, after &lt;a href=\"Louren%C3%A7o%20Marques%20%28explorer%29\"&gt;the navigator of the same name&lt;/a&gt; who explored the area in 1544. The modern city traces its origins to a &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; fort established on the site in 1781. A town grew around the fort starting around 1850, and in 1877 it was elevated to city status. In 1898, the colony of &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Mozambique\"&gt;Portuguese Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; relocated its capital there. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Louren\u00e7o Marques grew both in population and economic development as a port city. Upon &lt;a href=\"Mozambican%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Mozambican independence&lt;/a&gt; in 1975, the city became the national capital and was renamed Maputo. During the &lt;a href=\"Mozambican%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Mozambican Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the city's economy was devastated. When the war ended, the &lt;a href=\"FRELIMO\"&gt;FRELIMO&lt;/a&gt; government launched a program to revive the city's economy, and to clean up the city by forcibly removing criminals, squatters, and undocumented residents.\nMaputo has a number of landmarks, including &lt;a href=\"Pra%C3%A7a%20da%20Independ%C3%AAncia\"&gt;Independence Square&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maputo%20City%20Hall\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt;, Maputo Fortress, the &lt;a href=\"Maputo%20central%20market\"&gt;central market&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tunduru%20Gardens\"&gt;Tunduru Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maputo%20Railway%20Station\"&gt;Maputo Railway Station&lt;/a&gt;. Maputo is known as an aesthetically attractive, if dilapidated, city. With wide avenues lined by &lt;a href=\"Jacaranda%20mimosifolia\"&gt;jacaranda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"acacia\"&gt;acacia&lt;/a&gt; trees, it has earned the nicknames \"City of Acacias\" and the \"Pearl of the Indian Ocean\". The city is known for its distinct, eclectic architecture, with &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20colonial%20architecture\"&gt;Portuguese colonial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Neoclassical%20architecture\"&gt;Neoclassical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manueline\"&gt;Manueline&lt;/a&gt; styles alongside &lt;a href=\"Modern%20architecture\"&gt;modern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Art%20Deco\"&gt;Art Deco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bauhaus\"&gt;Bauhaus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brutalist%20architecture\"&gt;Brutalist&lt;/a&gt; buildings. The historic \"Baixa de Maputo\" district is the &lt;a href=\"downtown\"&gt;downtown&lt;/a&gt; area. Maputo has a vibrant cultural scene, with many restaurants, music and performance venues, and local film industry. Maputo's economy is centered around its &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Maputo\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt;, through which much of Mozambique's imports and exports are shipped. The chief exports include &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chromite\"&gt;chromite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sisal\"&gt;sisal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"copra\"&gt;copra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"hardwood\"&gt;hardwood&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to trade, the city has robust &lt;a href=\"manufacturing\"&gt;manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tertiary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy\"&gt;service&lt;/a&gt; sectors. Several colleges and universities are located in Maputo, including &lt;a href=\"Pedagogical%20University\"&gt;Pedagogical University&lt;/a&gt;, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e1s University, Catholic University of Mozambique, and &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20Mondlane%20University\"&gt;Eduardo Mondlane University&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest in the country.\nHistory.\nOn the northern bank of Esp\u00edrito Santo Estuary of &lt;a href=\"Delagoa%20Bay\"&gt;Delagoa Bay&lt;/a&gt;, an inlet of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, Louren\u00e7o Marques was named after &lt;a href=\"Louren%C3%A7o%20Marques%20%28explorer%29\"&gt;the Portuguese navigator&lt;/a&gt; who, with Ant\u00f3nio Caldeira, was sent in 1544 by the governor of &lt;a href=\"Island%20of%20Mozambique\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; on a voyage of exploration. They explored the lower courses of the rivers emptying their waters into Delagoa Bay, notably the Esp\u00edrito Santo. The forts and trading stations that the Portuguese established, abandoned and reoccupied on the north bank of the river were all named \"Louren\u00e7o Marques\". The existing town dates from about 1850, with the previous settlement having been entirely destroyed by the natives. The town developed around a Portuguese fortress completed in 1787.\nOn 9 December 1876, Louren\u00e7o Marques was elevated to the status of village, and on the 10 November 1887 it became a city. The Luso-British conflict for the possession of Louren\u00e7o Marques ended on the 24th of July 1875 with &lt;a href=\"Patrice%20de%20MacMahon\"&gt;Patrice de MacMahon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20French%20Republic\"&gt;French President&lt;/a&gt;, ruling in favour of Portugal.\nIn 1871, the town was described as a poor place, with narrow streets, fairly good flat-roofed houses, grass huts, decayed forts, and a rusty cannon, enclosed by a recently erected wall high and protected by bastions at intervals. The growing importance of the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Republic\"&gt;Transvaal&lt;/a&gt; led, however, to greater interest being taken back in Portugal in the development of a port. A commission was sent by the Portuguese government in 1876 to drain the marshy land near the settlement, to plant the blue &lt;a href=\"gum%20tree\"&gt;gum tree&lt;/a&gt;, and to build a hospital and a church. A city since 1887, it superseded the &lt;a href=\"Island%20of%20Mozambique\"&gt;Island of Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; as the capital of &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20East%20Africa\"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; in 1898. In 1895, the opening of the &lt;a href=\"NZASM\"&gt;NZASM&lt;/a&gt; railroad to &lt;a href=\"Pretoria\"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, caused the city's population to grow. The &lt;a href=\"Witwatersrand%20Gold%20Rush\"&gt;Witwatersrand Gold Rush&lt;/a&gt;, which began in 1886, also increased the economic development of the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as Louren\u00e7o Marques served as the closest seaport for the export of gold from South Africa.\nIn the early 20th century, with a well equipped seaport, with piers, quays, landing sheds and electric cranes which enabled large vessels to discharge cargoes direct into the railway trucks, Louren\u00e7o Marques developed under Portuguese rule and achieved great importance as a lively cosmopolitan city. It was served by British, Portuguese, and German liners, and the majority of its imported goods were shipped to &lt;a href=\"Southampton\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the continuous growth of the city's population due to its expanding economy centered on the seaport, from the 1940s Portugal's administration built a network of primary and secondary schools, industrial and commercial schools as well as the first university in the region. The &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Louren%C3%A7o%20Marques\"&gt;University of Louren\u00e7o Marques&lt;/a&gt; was opened in 1962. Portuguese, Islamic (including &lt;a href=\"Ismaili\"&gt;Ismaili&lt;/a&gt;s), Indian (including from &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20India\"&gt;Portuguese India&lt;/a&gt;) and Chinese (including &lt;a href=\"Macanese%20people\"&gt;Macanese&lt;/a&gt;) communities \u2014 but not the unskilled African majority \u2014 achieved great prosperity by developing the industrial and commercial sectors of the city. Urban areas of Mozambique grew quickly in this period due to the lack of restriction on the internal migration of indigenous Mozambicans, a situation that differed from the &lt;a href=\"apartheid\"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt; policies of neighboring South Africa. Before Mozambique's independence in 1975, thousands of tourists from &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhodesia\"&gt;Rhodesia&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;) frequented the city and its scenic beaches, high-quality hotels, restaurants, casinos, and brothels.\nThe Mozambique Liberation Front, or &lt;a href=\"FRELIMO\"&gt;FRELIMO&lt;/a&gt;, formed in &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; in 1962 and led by &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20Mondlane\"&gt;Eduardo Mondlane&lt;/a&gt;, fought for independence from Portuguese rule. The &lt;a href=\"Mozambican%20War%20of%20Independence\"&gt;Mozambican War of Independence&lt;/a&gt; lasted over 10 years, ending only in 1974 when the &lt;a href=\"Estado%20Novo%20%28Portugal%29\"&gt;Estado Novo&lt;/a&gt; regime was overthrown in Lisbon by a leftist military coup \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Carnation%20Revolution\"&gt;Carnation Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. The new government of Portugal granted independence to almost all Portuguese overseas territories (except for &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Timor\"&gt;Timor Leste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Macau\"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe words \"Aqui \u00e9 Portugal\" (\"Here is Portugal\") were once inscribed on the walkway of its municipal building.\nIndependence.\nThe &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Mozambique\"&gt;People's Republic of Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; was proclaimed on 25 June 1975 in accordance with the &lt;a href=\"Lusaka%20Accord\"&gt;Lusaka Accord&lt;/a&gt; signed in September 1974. A parade and a state banquet completed the independence festivities in the capital, which was expected to be renamed Can Phumo, or \"Place of Phumo,\" after a &lt;a href=\"Shangaan\"&gt;Shangaan&lt;/a&gt; chief who lived in the area before the Portuguese navigator &lt;a href=\"Louren%C3%A7o%20Marques%20%28explorer%29\"&gt;Louren\u00e7o Marques&lt;/a&gt; first visited the site in 1545 and gave his name to it. However, after independence, the city's &lt;a href=\"Geographical%20renaming\"&gt;name was changed&lt;/a&gt; (in February 1976) to Maputo. Maputo's name reputedly has its origin in the &lt;a href=\"Maputo%20River\"&gt;Maputo River&lt;/a&gt;: in fact, this river, which marks the border with &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in the far South of Mozambique, had become symbolic during the FRELIMO-led armed struggle against Portuguese sovereignty, after the motto \u00ab\"Viva Mo\u00e7ambique unido, do Rovuma ao Maputo\"\u00bb, that is, \"Hail Mozambique, united from Rovuma down to Maputo\" (&lt;a href=\"Rovuma\"&gt;Rovuma&lt;/a&gt; is the river which marks the border with &lt;a href=\"Tanzania\"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; in the far North).\nAfter the independence, the statues to Portuguese heroes in the capital city were removed and most were stored at the fortress. Black soldiers carrying Russian rifles replaced &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Army\"&gt;Portuguese Army&lt;/a&gt; soldiers (both black and white) with western arms in city barracks and on the streets. Most of the city's streets, originally named for Portuguese heroes or important dates in &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Portuguese history&lt;/a&gt;, had their names changed to African languages, revolutionary figures, or pre-colonial historical names.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Carnation%20Revolution\"&gt;Carnation Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in Lisbon, over 250,000 Portuguese pulled out virtually overnight, leaving Mozambique's economy and administration unmanageable. With the exodus of trained Portuguese personnel, the newly independent country had no time to allocate resources to maintain its well-developed infrastructure. In addition, authoritarian &lt;a href=\"Stalinism\"&gt;Stalinist&lt;/a&gt; policies and bureaucratic central planning made the newly independent country slip into an extremely precarious condition since the beginning, and so the economy plummeted. FRELIMO, now the governing party, turned to the &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; governments of the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt; for help. By the early 1980s the country was bankrupt. Money was worthless and shops were empty. Starting shortly after independence, the country was plagued by the &lt;a href=\"Mozambican%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Mozambican Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, a long and violent struggle between &lt;a href=\"FRELIMO\"&gt;FRELIMO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"RENAMO\"&gt;RENAMO&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted from 1977 to 1992. The war adversely affected economic activity and political stability in the city. \"Operation Production\" (\"Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Produ\u00e7\u00e3o\") was inaugurated in 1983 by the ruling FRELIMO party to deal with the economic crisis. Undocumented residents of Maputo, the \"parasitic\" urban population, as well as individuals who displayed criminal behavior, were forcibly transferred to state-owned communal farms and villages in the rural north of Mozambique.\nSince the peace agreement ending the civil war, which was signed in 1992, the country and the city has returned to its pre-independence levels of political stability. This stability is an encouraging sign that makes Mozambique a promising country for foreign investment.\nOn 11 July 2003, the &lt;a href=\"Maputo%20Protocol\"&gt;Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa&lt;/a&gt;, better known as the &lt;a href=\"Maputo%20Protocol\"&gt;Maputo Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, was adopted in the city by the &lt;a href=\"African%20Union\"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nMaputo is located on the west side of &lt;a href=\"Maputo%20Bay\"&gt;Maputo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, near the Estu\u00e1rio do Esp\u00edrito Santo where the four rivers &lt;a href=\"Tembe%20River\"&gt;Tembe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Umbeluzi\"&gt;Umbeluzi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Matola%20River\"&gt;Matola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Infulene%20River\"&gt;Infulene&lt;/a&gt; drain. The bay is long and wide. At the extreme east of the city and bay is the island of &lt;a href=\"Inhaca\"&gt;Inhaca&lt;/a&gt;. The total area covered by the municipality of Maputo is and borders the city of &lt;a href=\"Matola\"&gt;Matola&lt;/a&gt; northeast and east, the districts of &lt;a href=\"Marracuene%20District\"&gt;Marracuene&lt;/a&gt; to the north; &lt;a href=\"Boane%20District\"&gt;Boane&lt;/a&gt; in the east and &lt;a href=\"Matutu%C3%ADne%20District\"&gt;Matutu\u00edne&lt;/a&gt; at the south all of which are part of Maputo Province. The city is from the South African border at &lt;a href=\"Ressano%20Garcia\"&gt;Ressano Garcia&lt;/a&gt; and from the border with &lt;a href=\"Eswatini\"&gt;Eswatini&lt;/a&gt; near the town of &lt;a href=\"Namaacha\"&gt;Namaacha&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdministrative subdivisions.\nThe city is divided into seven main administrative divisions. Each of these consists of several smaller city quarters or \"bairros\".\nClimate.\nMaputo features a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20savanna%20climate\"&gt;tropical savanna climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Aw\") bordering on a &lt;a href=\"hot%20semi-arid%20climate\"&gt;hot semi-arid climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"BSh\") under the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt;. Maputo is a relatively dry city, averaging of precipitation per year. Precipitation is abundant during summer and only little during winter. The city has a relatively warm climate averaging a mean temperature of . The hottest month is January with a mean temperature of , while the coolest month is July with a mean temperature of .\nSituated on the Indian Ocean, Maputo is particularly vulnerable to climate impacts such as cyclones, flooding and sea level rise. Poverty and inequality, which are concentrated in the overpopulated &lt;a href=\"bairro\"&gt;bairro&lt;/a&gt;s, further exacerbate climate change vulnerabilities in the city.\nInfrastructure.\n[[File:Hotel Polana.jpg|thumb|The Hotel Polana]]\n[[File:New_Banco_de_Mo%C3%A7ambique_towers_in_construction,_2015_(2).jpg|thumb|Central Bank of Mozambique]]\n[[File:Mercado_Municipal_(4107187974).jpg|thumb|Municipal Market of Maputo]]\nThe central area of Maputo corresponds to a planned city with square blocks and wide avenues, with Portuguese traces and their typical architecture of the 1970s. After the [[Carnation Revolution]] (1974) military coup in [[Lisbon]], Portuguese refugees fled in massive numbers close to the date of independence (1975), and the resultant lack of skills and capital, in the context of a fierce civil war and government mismanagement, contributed to its state of dereliction in the years following these events. Nevertheless, the city itself was never damaged, since it was tacitly considered neutral ground during both the colonial and the civil war.\nRecovery of the older infrastructure has been slow and most property developers in recent years have decided to invest in the construction of new properties rather than rehabilitating any of the existing ones. The rates for property in the city are high as investment increases, larger numbers of businesses are hoping to locate within easy reach of the airports, banks and other facilities. The infrastructure is expected to spread out across vacant areas of the city hopefully easing property prices within the next couple of years.\nMaputo faces many challenges, such as poor transport and drainage infrastructure, which have profound implications on people\u2019s livelihoods, particularly in informal settlements. Inadequate planning regulation and law enforcement, as well as perceived corruption in government processes, lack of communication across government departments and lack of concern or government coordination with respect to building codes are major impediments to progressing the development of Maputo's infrastructure, according to the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]].\nAs a coastal city, Maputo is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise, and population growth is putting increasing pressure on the coastal areas.\nDespite its Portuguese heritage, all vehicles are right-hand drive and drive on the left hand side of the road.\nLand is not for sale.\nAnother more general impediment is often attributed to land which is legally not for sale in Mozambique. All land is property of the state for which the state grants the rights to use the land. This presupposition combined with historical problems in managing inheritance and documentation have led to complications which discourage investment and expansion of the city.\nLand, while not sold officially, is actively traded and exchanged on a secondary market leading to the development of unplanned areas and slums in metropolitan areas which the Government, due to the lack of tax money, has no capacity and infrastructure to deal with. The result of such policies is manifested in a crowded CBD, inadequate transport network and crumbling roads.\nPROMAPUTO.\nIn 2007, the municipality of Maputo began a project to seriously consider rehabilitating the city's infrastructure. PROMAPUTO was a project that began as co-operation between the local city council and the [[International Development Association]] (IDA) of the [[World Bank]]. The first phase (PROMAPUTO1) took place between 2007 and 2010 and was chiefly concerned with developing the systems, knowledge and planning required to support the gradual overhaul of the infrastructure. The project was broken into several key areas and a budget allocated to each of these, namely: Institutional Development, Financial Sustainability, Urban Planning, Urban Infrastructure Investment and Maintenance, Metropolitan Development (services such as waste collection and disposal). The total financial allocation for this phase was USD 30 million. Little was done, however.\n[[File:A Direc\u00e7\u00e3o dos Correios, Tel\u00e9grafos e Telefones e o seu pessoal - Louren\u00e7o Marques.jpg|thumb|left|Maputo's central mail station]]\nIn 2011, PROMAPUTO2, the second phase of the project began. This phase was to last until 2015 and a total of USD 105 million was spent. The plan called for an IT systems, Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) together with [[Geographic Information System]] ([[GIS]]). These systems would supposedly help the municipality control its budgets and manage tenders, while the [[GIS]] would allow for precise information about land location and titling to be kept. Several roads should have been expanded and improved and the Avenida Julius Nyerere finally completed. Financial sustainability for the project was to be guaranteed through the improved collection of property tax (IPRA). The project also coincided with the recent overhaul of the Road Safety and Traffic Regulations (final completion 2020) which was an antiquated system that had not seen changes since the 1950s. Amongst the new regulations, heavy penalties and fines would now apply to many detrimental actions done by automobiles, such as pollution, loud noises, and illegal maneuvers.\nElectronic parking meters have now been installed in some areas of the CBD to curb a chronic shortage and wrongful use of parking space.\nBuilding projects.\n[[File:Maputo\u2013Katembe bridge from the norther shore; July 2018.jpg|thumb|On November 10, 2018, the [[Maputo\u2013Katembe bridge]], Africa's largest [[suspension bridge]], was inaugurated, connecting the cities of Maputo and [[Katembe]]]]\nIn spite of its previous instability, Mozambique is experiencing one of the fastest growth rates for a developing country in the world. The projected growth rate for 2011 is expected to be around 7.5%, some of it centered on the construction of several capital intensive projects in Maputo. Some of the more notable developments include Edificio 24, a mixed-use development that will be located at the center of the city along Avenida 24 Julho and Avenida Salvador Allende. The Maputo Business Tower is a modern 19-story building. The Radisson Blu corporation has constructed a 22 story hotel with 256 rooms in one of the city's trendiest spots on the \"marginal\" along the beach. A 15-story building for the second largest telecommunication company in the country, [[Vodacom]], was projected to be completed in 2010. The regeneration of the Maputo waterfront is an urban regeneration project that is being developed at site of the former annual industrial fair grounds (FACIM).\nRehabilitation projects.\nIn February 2011, president [[Armando Guebuza]] announced that the [[Vila Algarve]] would be restored to its former condition and the building transformed into a museum for the veterans of the civil war. The Vila Algarve belonged to the [[PIDE|International and State Defence Police (PIDE)]] during colonial rule. It was where political prisoners and others accused of conspiring to harm the regime were taken for interrogation and torture. There are claims that several individuals were executed in the building. No dates have been released on when the renovation is to commence. The building has changed ownership several times and has been an off-on residence for squatters.\nSports facilities.\nMaputo has a number of stadiums designed for football, which can be modified for other purposes, such as the new [[Est\u00e1dio do Zimpeto]], [[Est\u00e1dio do Maxaquene]] and the [[Est\u00e1dio do Costa do Sol]] which can seat 32,000, 15,000 and 10,000 people respectively. The largest stadium in the Metropolitan Area is, however, the [[Est\u00e1dio da Machava]] (opened as Est\u00e1dio Salazar), located in neighbouring [[Matola]] municipality. It opened in 1968, in Machava and was at the time the most advanced in the country conforming to standards set by [[FIFA]] and the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI). The cycling track could be adjusted to allow for 20,000 more seats. It was the site where [[Portugal]] officially handed over the country to [[Samora Machel]] and [[FRELIMO]] on 25 June 1975. In 2005, the [[Birmingham]] based [[reggae]] group [[UB40]] held a one-night-only concert in the stadium filled to maximum capacity. A newer stadium called the [[Est\u00e1dio do Zimpeto]] which is located in the suburb of Zimpeto will be opened in 2011. The stadium will be built in time for the [[2011 All-Africa Games]] with a capacity for 42,000 spectators. A smaller football stadium, [[Est\u00e1dio Mahafil]], holds 4,000 people.\nBeginning in the 1950s, motorsport was introduced to the city. At first race cars would compete in areas around the city, Polana and along the \"marginal\" but as funding and interest increased, a dedicated race track was built in the Costa Do Sol area along and behind the \"marginal\" with the ocean to the east with a length of . The initial surface of the new track, named Aut\u00f3dromo de Louren\u00e7o Marques did not provide enough grip and an accident in the late 1960s killed 8 people and injured many more. Therefore, in 1970, the track was renovated and the surface changed to meet the safety requirements that were needed at large events with many spectators. The length then increased to . The city became host to several international and local events beginning with the inauguration on 26 November 1970. The track was abandoned after 1975 and events only occurred sporadically such as in 1981 when the government allowed the sport again. Since 2000, interest has been rekindled by the Automovel &amp; Touring Club de Mo\u00e7ambique (ATCM) and several events including go-carting, drag racing and motocross are planned.\nThe city's main basketball arena is the [[Pavilh\u00e3o do Maxaquene]] which holds up to 3,500 people. It is home to [[Ferrovi\u00e1rio de Maputo (basketball)|Ferrovi\u00e1rio de Maputo]] which competes in the [[Basketball Africa League]] and the [[Mozambican Basketball League]].\nStreet names.\nThe street names were changed after independence in 1975. Close ties with the [[Eastern Bloc]] highly influenced the new names that were chosen as did removal of names referring to colonial era figures.\nTransport.\nAirports.\n[[File:Maputo airport, 2.jpg|thumb|[[Maputo International Airport]]]]\n[[Maputo International Airport]] is the main international airport of Mozambique. The new terminal was opened in 2010 with a capacity for 900,000 passengers per year. Work has begun on the construction of a new domestic terminal which will have a capacity for many more passengers at any given time. The construction work will require the current building to be demolished.\nBuses.\nMaputo's transportation needs are mainly served by minibus taxis called \"chapas\", which are believed to transport the majority of the city's commuters. In an effort to resolve a public transport crisis in the city, the state-owned company, Transporte de Mo\u00e7ambique (TPM) has recently acquired a new fleet of 270+ buses. There are three major bus terminals in the city: at Baixa (downtown/central), Museu (Museum), and at Junta (regional and national buses).\nFerries.\n[[File:Avenida_24_de_Julho_Maputo_(2858426557).jpg|thumb|24 de Julho Avenue, Maputo]]\n[[File:Maputo Train Station.jpg|thumb|right|The Maputo Railway Station, an example of colonial architecture]]\nFerry boats departing from Maputo to the district of KaTembe are available during the week. A ferry can carry approximately 20 vehicles per trip.\nRails.\nThe city of maputo lies at the end of three railway lines: [[Goba railway]], [[Limpopo railway]] and [[Pretoria\u2013Maputo railway]].\nTrams.\nMaputo was home to one of the first electric tramway systems in Africa, commencing in February 1904. At first the lines ran from the Central Railway Station (CFM) to the City Municipality building. It is said that the establishment of the tram system caused some protests from the general public as certain classes had limited access to its use. Trams lost favor in the second half of the 20th century as cars and buses became more common, and they have not been in use at all since 1936, although parts of some of the tracks can still be seen coming up through the tar in certain streets, like Av. 24 de Julho.\nPorts.\n[[File:Maputo skyline 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Maputo's harbour is very important economically to the city.]]\nThe main [[port of Maputo]] handled 17 million tons of cargo in 1971, at its peak. It was part of the trio of Mozambique's main ports for the Nacala-Beira-Maputo route. Today, it is managed by the Maputo Port Development Company (MPDC), a joint venture of [[Grindrod Bank|Grindrod]] and [[DP World]]. The government has allowed the firm to manage the port until 2030 in order to upgrade much of its infrastructure that has been destroyed after years of stagnation. In 2010, the dredging works in the channel were finished and the Port of Maputo can now handle larger vessels \u2013 such as the Panamax vessels \u2013 with more cargo. In addition, investments are being made for specific types of terminals such as:\nA new terminal for vehicles is also planned which will allow for 57,000 vehicles to be moved per year (Phase 1) with a peak 250,000 under an agreement with [[H\u00f6egh Autoliners]] as potential trans-shipment route between the [[Middle East]] and [[Europe]]. Coal will also be exported from the [[Matola]] side at a rate of 10 million tons per year. It is envisaged that by 2020, the port will generate about USD 160 million per year. By 2030, the port will be able to handle up to 25 trains a day and 1,500 trucks for a total of 50 million tons of cargo per year. The total investment will exceed USD 500 million.\nOther means.\nA recent introduction are three-wheelers commonly known as tuk-tuks in some Asian countries. The three-wheeled bikes, called \"tchopelas\" by the population, are cheaper to own and run and have posed a commercial threat to conventional taxis.\nArchitecture.\n[[File:Avenida Samora Machel towards Maputo City Hall.jpg|thumb|Maputo city council building]]\n[[FIle:The_Iron_House_(5032406900).jpg|thumb|\"A Casa de Ferro\" - The Iron House]]\nMaputo had always been the center of attention during its formative years and this strong artistic spirit was responsible for attracting some of the world's most forward architects at the turn of the 20th century. The city is home to masterpieces of building work by [[Pancho Guedes]], [[Herbert Baker]] and Thomas Honney amongst others. The earliest architectural efforts around the city focused on classical European designs such as the Central Train Station (CFM) designed by architects Alfredo Augusto Lisboa de Lima, Mario Veiga and Ferreira da Costa and built between 1913 and 1916 (sometimes mistaken with the work of [[Gustav Eiffel]]), and the Hotel Polana designed by [[Herbert Baker]].\nAs the 1960s and 1970s approached, Maputo was yet again at the center of a new wave of architectural influences made most popular by [[Pancho Guedes]]. The designs of the 1960s and 1970s were characterized by [[modernist]] movements of clean, straight and functional structures. However, prominent architects such as [[Pancho Guedes]] fused this with local art schemes giving the city's buildings a unique Mozambican theme. As a result, most of the properties erected during the second construction boom take on these styling cues.\nCulture.\nMaputo is a melting pot of several cultures. The [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Portuguese People|Portuguese]] cultures dominate, but the influence of [[Arab]], [[India]]n, and [[China|Chinese]] cultures is also felt.\nFilm and cinema.\nBefore television was introduced in 1981, film and cinema had a prominent position as a form of entertainment in the lives of Mozambicans especially in Maputo where there were at least a dozen movie theaters by the time of independence. In the 1950s and 1960s, at the height of racial segregation, most of the movie-goers were either European whites or South Asians \u2013 each group having their own designated locale. Black Mozambicans, although more heavily discriminated against, also enjoyed movies in makeshift theatres, often in rooms temporarily converted to handle a projector, screen and chairs. Some of the cinemas can still be seen today, such as the Charlot, Gil Vicente, the Scala, 222 and the Dicca, although not all are still showing movies.\nThe movies screened at the theaters during Portuguese rule were heavily censored. Movies containing sex, violence and themes with a political nature were not allowed but despite these restrictions, it was the first time Mozambicans were able to enjoy entertainment that was prevalent in the rest of the world, thereby greatly increasing cultural affinity. After 1975 and the ensuing mass exodus of European whites, for a time no censorship regulations were in place and Mozambicans could watch content that was previously banned by the dictatorship, and the works of [[Bruce Lee]] became immensely popular. However, once [[FRELIMO]] and the nationalist movement gained momentum, any external influence considered as originating from the \"decadent West\" was again not allowed. It was at this moment that Mozambique's ruling party FRELIMO realized the immediate potential films could have in delivering propaganda relatively easily.\nFor much of the late 1970s and 1980s, the local film industry was geared towards creating \"home-made\" productions depicting [[Socialist]] ideologies which placed great influence on the family unit, the non-commercialized production of agriculture and political autonomy. Maputo has been the setting for many [[Hollywood]] blockbuster movies such as \"[[The Interpreter]]\", \"[[Blood Diamond (film)|Blood Diamond]]\" and \"[[Ali (film)|Ali]]\".\nAssocia\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00facleo de Arte.\n[[File:Biblioteca Nacional Mo\u00e7ambique.jpg|right|thumb|The Mozambique National Library.]]\n[[File:Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es de Mo\u00e7ambique, Rua da S\u00e9 2, Maputo, Mo\u00e7ambique.jpg|thumb|right|Telecommunications of Mozambique seat in Rua da S\u00e9 2, Maputo]]\nAn important cultural and artists' centre in Maputo is the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00facleo de Arte. It is the oldest collective of artists in Mozambique. Seated in an old villa in the centre of Maputo the N\u00facleo has played a significant role in metropolitan cultural life for decades. The two best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists started their career at N\u00facleo de Arte, the painter [[Malangatana Ngwenya]] and the sculptor [[Alberto Chissano]]. Over one hundred painters, sculptors and ceramists are members of the N\u00facleo, which regularly stages exhibitions on its own premises and over the last few years has actively participated in exchanges with artists from abroad. The N\u00facleo became well known for their project transforming arms into tools and objects of art. It played an important role for reconciliation after the [[Mozambican Civil War]]. The exhibition of art objects such as the [[Throne of Weapons|Chair of the African King]] and the [[Tree of Life (Kester)|Tree of Life]] was shown around the world, among others in the [[British Museum]] in 2006.\nMaputo is home to the [[Dockanema]] Documentary Film Festival, and international festival showcasing documentary films from around the world.\nLandmarks.\nDuring its five centuries of Portuguese colonialization, the city has gained several examples of Portuguese architecture. Most of the note-worthy buildings are former colonial administrative buildings or current government buildings.\nThe city's landmarks include:\n[[File:Jardim Tunduru.jpg|right|thumb|Maputo's Tunduru Garden, with its [[Manueline]] arch]]\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maputo]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Reformed Church in Mozambique]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Igreja Presbiteriana de Mo\u00e7ambique]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Conven\u00e7\u00e3o Baptista de Mo\u00e7ambique]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Zion Christian Church]]. There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.\nParks.\n[[File:Flowered Maputo.jpg|thumb|A flowered terrace in Maputo]]\nThe city does not yet have a very expansive list of parks and other recreational areas. However, at the center of the city lies the Jardim Tunduru ([[Tunduru Gardens]]) which was formerly called the Vasco Da Gama Garden. It was designed in the 1880s by a [[United Kingdom|British]] architect, Thomas Honney. The entrance of the park is designed in the [[Neo-Manueline]] style. After independence, the name was changed to the current one and a statue of the country's first president was erected.\nEducation.\nMaputo offers several options for education with pre-schools, primary, secondary schools and higher education institutions. The quality of the syllabus is said to differ greatly depending on whether an institution is private or public.\nHigher education.\nMozambique's largest higher education institution is the [[Universidade Eduardo Mondlane]] which was established in 1968 as the Universidade de Louren\u00e7o Marques. Most of the universities faculties and departments are located in the city of Maputo with nearly 8,000 students attending 10 faculties. Some faculties also exist in [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Quelimane]], Nampula and [[Inhambane]].\nSince the 1990s there has also been a rapid growth of private education houses offering higher education such as \"Instituto Superior de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologias de Mo\u00e7ambique\" (ISCTEM), \"Instituto Superior de Tecnologias e Gest\u00e3o\" (ISTEG) and \"Instituto Superior de Transportes e Comunica\u00e7\u00f5es\" (ISUTC).\nSecondary education.\nIn the secondary education market, there is again a strong divergence between private and public schooling.\nMaputo's private schools include:\nSome expatriates have chosen to enroll their children in schools in [[Mbombela]], [[South Africa]] and [[Waterford Kamhlaba]] in [[Mbabane]], [[Eswatini]].\nHealth services.\n[[File:Hospital_Central_de_Maputo_(503881920).jpg|thumb|Central Hospital of Maputo]]\nMaputo has several hospitals and clinics, including the city and country's largest hospital, the Hospital Central de Maputo (Maputo Central Hospital). Other hospitals include the public Hospital Geral Jos\u00e9 Macamo, and the private Clinica Sommerschield, the Cl\u00ednica Cruz Azul in \"baixa\" and Hospital Privado located across the Portuguese School.\nThe construction of Hospital Miguel Bombarda began in 1900. In 1976, [[Samora Machel]] renamed the hospital as \"Hospital Central de Maputo\" (HCM). The hospital has 1500 beds for in-patients and has an estimated staff number of 3000. It is made of a multi-block structure with 35 separate buildings spanning an area of 163,800 m2. The hospital has six departments: [[Medicine]], [[Surgery]], [[Pediatrics]], [[Orthopedics]], [[Gynaecology]] and [[Obstetrics]]. It also has divisions for [[Ophthalmology]] and [[Otolaryngology]] and a morgue. The hospital provides services for an average 700 out-patients a day and over of washing is done daily. In the early 1990s, a section of the hospital was divided and turned into a private clinic offering higher quality services for those who could afford it called the \"Cl\u00ednica Especial de Maputo\". The residence for the head of medicine is on the corner of \"Avenida Eduardo Mondlane\" and \"Avenida Salavador Allende\". It is a historically valuable structure which was completed in 1908 and has since the 1990s been converted into a charming restaurant with colonial themes called \"Restaurante 1908\". The upper floors are still used by the hospital as offices.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nMaputo is [[Sister city|twinned]] with:\nCooperation agreements.\nMaputo also has a cooperation agreement with:\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Maputo| ]]\n[[Category:Capitals in Africa]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Provinces of Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Provincial capitals in Mozambique]]\n[[Category:Port cities in Africa]]\n[[Category:Port cities and towns of the Indian Ocean]]\n[[Category:1782 establishments in the Portuguese Empire]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1781]]"
