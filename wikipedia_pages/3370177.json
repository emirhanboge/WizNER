Turkish coach Fatih Terim used him as a right defender in the first two games of the tournament, a move that was heavily criticized by the media, since Alt\u0131ntop was a midfielder for his then-club Bayern Munich. After the match against &lt;a href=\"Switzerland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, Terim switched him to midfield for the remainder of the tournament, which boosted both Turkey's and his own performance.
