The school is named after Australian author &lt;a href=\"Miles%20Franklin\"&gt;Miles Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and was opened in 1980; as Franklin's novel \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Brilliant%20Career\"&gt;My Brilliant Career&lt;/a&gt;\" had received public acclaim in 1979, it seemed suitable for the school to be named in recognition of her. Each year the school celebrates her birthday with a writing competition and an 'old fashion' dress up day. During this day the students are involved in a variety of activities from yesteryear.\nThe school's colours are red, blue and white.\nThey have three houses, all named after Australian authors: \nThe houses compete in &lt;a href=\"swimming%20%28sport%29\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; carnivals, &lt;a href=\"sport%20of%20athletics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt; carnivals, and to a lesser extent, &lt;a href=\"Cross-country%20running\"&gt;cross country&lt;/a&gt; races."
