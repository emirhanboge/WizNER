    "text": "This article gives an overview of liberalism and centrism in &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. It is limited to &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"centrist\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"political%20party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign \u21d2 means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.\nLiberalism was a major force in Finland since 1894. After independence the current gradually decreased. A major other force, agrarianism, choose in 1965 to develop itself into a more centrist current. The liberal character of the &lt;a href=\"Centre%20Party%20%28Finland%29\"&gt;Finnish Center&lt;/a&gt; (\"Suomen Keskusta\"), member of &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20International\"&gt;LI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats%20for%20Europe%20Party\"&gt;ELDR&lt;/a&gt;, is based on liberal ideas like &lt;a href=\"decentralization\"&gt;decentralization&lt;/a&gt;, peasant-like freedom and &lt;a href=\"progressivism\"&gt;progressivism&lt;/a&gt;. The Swedish minority party &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Finland%29\"&gt;Swedish People's Party&lt;/a&gt; (\"Svenska Folkpartiet i Finland\") is also a member of &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20International\"&gt;LI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats%20for%20Europe%20Party\"&gt;ELDR&lt;/a&gt;. The original liberal current is now organized in the &lt;a href=\"Liberals%20%28Finland%29\"&gt;Liberals&lt;/a&gt; (\"Liberaalit\"), a very small extra-parliamentary party. At the autonomous island of &lt;a href=\"%C3%85land\"&gt;\u00c5land&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Liberals%20for%20%C3%85land\"&gt;Liberals for \u00c5land&lt;/a&gt; (\"Liberalerna p\u00e5 \u00c5land\") are a dominant force.\nThe timeline.\nCentre Party / Finnish Centre.\nCentrists\nLiberal thinkers.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Contributions%20to%20liberal%20theory\"&gt;Contributions to liberal theory&lt;/a&gt; the following Finnish thinker is included:"
