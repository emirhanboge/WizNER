However, Brown was precluded from playing in any further games for the season.\n2015.\nOn 2 March, Brown signed a 2-year contract with &lt;a href=\"South%20Sydney%20Rabbitohs\"&gt;South Sydney&lt;/a&gt; effective immediately, after being released from his Wests contract.

The Blues would suffer a shock 2-1 series defeat against Queensland.\n2021.\nIn round 19 of the &lt;a href=\"2021%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2021 NRL season&lt;/a&gt;, Brown provided one of the bombed tries of the year. With the score in Canberra's favour 12-6, Parramatta put up a bomb which was caught by &lt;a href=\"Jakob%20Arthur\"&gt;Jakob Arthur&lt;/a&gt;, he then passed it to Brown who dropped the ball unmarked right near the try line. Parramatta would go on to lose the game 12-10.\nBrown made a total of 24 appearances for Parramatta in the &lt;a href=\"2021%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2021 NRL season&lt;/a&gt; and played in both finals matches for the club as they were once again knocked out in the second week for a third straight season."
