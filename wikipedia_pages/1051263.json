    "text": "The San Crist\u00f3bal of Huamanga National University (in Spanish, \"Universidad Nacional de San Crist\u00f3bal de Huamanga\") is a public university located in the city of &lt;a href=\"Ayacucho\"&gt;Ayacucho&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as Huamanga) in southern &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe university was established in 1677 by Crist\u00f3bal de Castilla y Zamora, the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"archbishop\"&gt;archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sucre\"&gt;La Plata o Charcas&lt;/a&gt;. Until it was closed in the mid-19th century, it operated mostly as a seminary for the training of Catholic priests. The government of Per\u00fa reopened it in 1959 as a national university.\nIn the 1960s, the university became a breeding ground for &lt;a href=\"communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; organizations, including the &lt;a href=\"Shining%20Path\"&gt;Shining Path&lt;/a&gt;. This group, led by philosophy professor &lt;a href=\"Abimael%20Guzm%C3%A1n\"&gt;Abimael Guzm\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;, started there before growing into a violent &lt;a href=\"guerrilla%20warfare\"&gt;guerrilla&lt;/a&gt; movement that conducted a &lt;a href=\"internal%20conflict%20in%20Peru\"&gt;bloody campaign&lt;/a&gt; against the government of Per\u00fa and against rival leftists groups. (See also &lt;a href=\"Efra%C3%ADn%20Morote%20Best\"&gt;Efra\u00edn Morote Best&lt;/a&gt;.)\nThe rector of the university is Homero Ango Aguilar, a biologist."
