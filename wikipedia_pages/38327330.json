    "text": "Africanus Fabius Maximus was a Roman senator. His elder brother was &lt;a href=\"Paullus%20Fabius%20Maximus\"&gt;Paullus Fabius Maximus&lt;/a&gt; (consul 11 BCE) and his sister was Fabia Paullina, who married &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Titius\"&gt;Marcus Titius&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is believed that Africanus was named in honour of his famous family ancestor &lt;a href=\"Scipio%20Aemilianus\"&gt;Scipio Africanus Aemilianus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nThe career of Africanus Fabius Maximus is much less clear than that of his brother. It is believed that Africanus' earliest post was as a military tribune in Spain, though this is not certain. His only two certain civilian posts were as ordinary consul in 10 BCE (with &lt;a href=\"Iullus%20Antonius\"&gt;Iullus Antonius&lt;/a&gt;), and as &lt;a href=\"proconsul\"&gt;proconsul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; in 6/5 BCE. He was admitted to the priesthood of the \"&lt;a href=\"septemviri%20epulonum\"&gt;septemviri epulonum&lt;/a&gt;\" at some point after 25 BCE.\nIt was during his tenure as proconsul of Africa that Africanus struck some coins that bore his own image.\nPossible family.\nAlthough no wife is attested for Africanus, it is possible that he had a daughter named &lt;a href=\"Fabia%20Numantina\"&gt;Fabia Numantina&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, she may have been the daughter of Africanus' brother, &lt;a href=\"Paullus%20Fabius%20Maximus\"&gt;Paullus Fabius Maximus&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Marcia%20%28wife%20of%20Paullus%20Fabius%20Maximus%29\"&gt;Marcia&lt;/a&gt;."
