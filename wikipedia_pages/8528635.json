    "text": "Marsvinsholm Castle () is situated in &lt;a href=\"Ystad%20Municipality\"&gt;Ystad Municipality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scania\"&gt;Scania&lt;/a&gt;, in southern &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Ystad\"&gt;Ystad&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe estate was first known as Bos\u00f8e, Bors\u00f8e and Bordsy\u00f8 and is known from the 14th century. During the late 14th century, it became part of the royal Danish &lt;a href=\"crown%20land\"&gt;crown land&lt;/a&gt;, and was owned by king &lt;a href=\"Valdemar%20Atterdag%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Valdermar Atterdag&lt;/a&gt; and later by his daughter, queen &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20I%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Margrethe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround 1520 it was pawned to Danish admiral &lt;a href=\"Jens%20Holgersen%20Ulfstand\"&gt;Jens Holgersen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ulfstand\"&gt;Ulfstand&lt;/a&gt; who in 1499 had constructed nearby &lt;a href=\"Glimmingehus\"&gt;Glimmingehus&lt;/a&gt;. The property ceased to be crown land.\nIn 1630, Palle Ulfsted sold the property to Danish nobleman Otte Marsvin, who constructed the present castle 1644\u20131648, naming it after his family. \"Marsvin\" is the Danish word for the \"&lt;a href=\"porpoise\"&gt;porpoise&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"holm\" is a small island. Otte Marsvin's sister, &lt;a href=\"Ellen%20Marsvin\"&gt;Ellen Marsvin&lt;/a&gt;, was the \"mother-in-law\" (her daughter Kirsten Munk was a common law wife to the king) of the king &lt;a href=\"Christian%20IV%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Christian IV of Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, and the Marsvin family was one of Denmark's largest property owners.\nOtte Marsvin constructed his castle on &lt;a href=\"beech\"&gt;beech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"deep%20foundation\"&gt;poles&lt;/a&gt; in a small lake. It is a four-storey, square structure. Two of the four corners, in the north east and the south west, are provided with five-storey towers. The castle was renovated thoroughly between 1782 and 1786 by count &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Ruuth\"&gt;Erik Ruuth&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1856-1857 baron &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Sj%C3%B6blad\"&gt;Jules Sj\u00f6blad&lt;/a&gt; hired Danish architect Ch. F. Zwingmann to restore the castle again. This last restoration gave the structure its current Dutch Renaissance (\"&lt;a href=\"Christian%20IV%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Christian IV&lt;/a&gt;\")-style.\nDue to the &lt;a href=\"Scanian%20War\"&gt;Scanian War&lt;/a&gt; (1675-1679), the pro-Danish owner Holger Thott was stripped of the castle by the Swedish crown. It has since then - through inheritance and sale - belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20people\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; families von K\u00f6nigsmarck, &lt;a href=\"de%20la%20Gardie\"&gt;de la Gardie&lt;/a&gt;, Sj\u00f6blad, &lt;a href=\"Ruuth\"&gt;Ruuth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piper%20%28family%29\"&gt;Piper&lt;/a&gt;, Tornerhielm and Wachtmeister. Count &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Wachtmeister%20%28Swedish%20count%29\"&gt;Carl Wachtmeister&lt;/a&gt; sold the castle and the remaining land to baron &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Stjernblad\"&gt;Jules Stjernblad&lt;/a&gt; in 1854. The castle was handed down to his daughter, countess Ida Eherensv\u00e4rd. Her children, Rutger, Louise and Madeleine Bennet owned it until 1910 when they sold it to Johannes Johannesen from Denmark. In 1938, he gave the property to his daughter, Anna Margrethe and her husband J\u00f8rgen Wendelboe-Larsen.\nIn 1978 their son, Erik Wendelboe-Larsen, sold the property to Bengt Iacobaeus, whose son, Tomas Iacobaeus, is the current owner of Marsvinsholm."
