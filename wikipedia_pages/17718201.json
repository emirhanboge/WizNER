While suitable for &lt;a href=\"upland%20hunting\"&gt;bird hunting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"clay%20pigeon%20shooting\"&gt;clay target shooting&lt;/a&gt; or home defense, it is primarily designed for &lt;a href=\"cowboy%20action%20shooting\"&gt;cowboy action shooting&lt;/a&gt;. As the name implies, it is a &lt;a href=\"coach%20gun\"&gt;coach gun&lt;/a&gt; style shotgun, similar to those used to defend &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt;es in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Old%20West\"&gt;American Old West&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeatures.\nThe Stoeger Coach Gun has been produced in 12 &lt;a href=\"gauge%20%28bore%20diameter%29\"&gt;gauge&lt;/a&gt;, 20 gauge and &lt;a href=\".410%20bore\"&gt;.410 bore&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"chamber%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;chambers&lt;/a&gt; are three inches long, to accommodate either 2\u00be inch or 3 inch &lt;a href=\"shotgun%20shell\"&gt;shells&lt;/a&gt;. Barrel lengths include 18, 20 and 24 inch. The gun has a raised center rib with a brass bead front sight. The Coach Gun has dual triggers, one for each barrel. The &lt;a href=\"safety%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; mechanism is located on the tang, on the upper rear part of the &lt;a href=\"receiver%20%28firearms%29\"&gt;receiver&lt;/a&gt;. Opening the &lt;a href=\"break-action\"&gt;action&lt;/a&gt; automatically engages the safety. To comply with cowboy action shooting regulations, the gun does not have ejectors, but it does have an extractor."
