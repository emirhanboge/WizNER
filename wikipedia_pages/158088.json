    "text": "Firefly is an American &lt;a href=\"space%20Western\"&gt;space Western&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drama%20%28modern%20genre%29\"&gt;drama&lt;/a&gt; television series, created by writer and director &lt;a href=\"Joss%20Whedon\"&gt;Joss Whedon&lt;/a&gt;, under his &lt;a href=\"Mutant%20Enemy%20Productions\"&gt;Mutant Enemy Productions&lt;/a&gt; label. Whedon served as an &lt;a href=\"executive%20producer\"&gt;executive producer&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Minear\"&gt;Tim Minear&lt;/a&gt;. The series is set in the year 2517, after the arrival of humans in a new star system, and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of \"&lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%28fictional%20spacecraft%29\"&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt;\", a \"\"Firefly\"-class\" &lt;a href=\"spacecraft\"&gt;spaceship&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"ensemble%20cast\"&gt;ensemble cast&lt;/a&gt; portrays the nine characters who live on \"Serenity\". Whedon pitched the show as \"nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things.\"\nThe show explores the lives of a group of people, some of whom fought on the losing side of a &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, who make a living on the fringes of society as part of the &lt;a href=\"Settler\"&gt;pioneer&lt;/a&gt; culture of their star system. In this future, the only two surviving superpowers, the United States and China, fused to form the central federal government, called the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%28Firefly%29\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the fusion of the two cultures. According to Whedon's vision, \"nothing will change in the future: technology will advance, but we will still have the same political, moral, and ethical problems as today.\"\n\"Firefly\" premiered in the U.S. on the &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt; network on September 20, 2002. By mid-December, \"Firefly\" had averaged 4.7 million viewers per episode and was 98th in &lt;a href=\"Nielsen%20ratings\"&gt;Nielsen ratings&lt;/a&gt;. It was &lt;a href=\"cancellation%20%28television%29\"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt; after 11 of the 14 produced episodes were aired. Despite the relatively short life span of the series, it received strong sales when it was released on &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; and has large fan support campaigns. It won a &lt;a href=\"Primetime%20Emmy%20Award\"&gt;Primetime Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 for &lt;a href=\"Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Special%20Visual%20Effects\"&gt;Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"TV%20Guide\"&gt;TV Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" ranked the series at No. 5 on their 2013 list of 60 shows that were \"Cancelled Too Soon\".\nThe post-airing success of the show led Whedon and &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Pictures\"&gt;Universal Pictures&lt;/a&gt; to produce \"&lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%282005%20film%29\"&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt;\", a 2005 film which continues the story from the series. The &lt;a href=\"Firefly%20%28franchise%29\"&gt;\"Firefly\" franchise&lt;/a&gt; expanded into other media, including &lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%28comics%29\"&gt;comics&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Serenity%20Role%20Playing%20Game\"&gt;role-playing game&lt;/a&gt;.\nPremise.\nBackstory.\nThe series takes place in the year 2517, on a variety of planets and moons. The TV series does not reveal whether these celestial bodies are within one star system, only saying that \"Serenity\"s mode of propulsion is a \"gravity-drive\". Re-runs start with Book or Captain Reynolds providing the following backstory:\nThe film \"&lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%282005%20film%29\"&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt;\" makes clear that the planets and moons are in an extensive system, and production documents related to the film indicate that there is no &lt;a href=\"faster-than-light\"&gt;faster-than-light&lt;/a&gt; travel in this &lt;a href=\"fictional%20universe\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt;. The characters occasionally refer to \"Earth-that-was\", and the film establishes that long before the events in the series, a large population had emigrated from &lt;a href=\"Earth\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; to a new &lt;a href=\"star%20system\"&gt;star system&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"generation%20ship\"&gt;generation ship&lt;/a&gt;s: \"Earth-that-was could no longer sustain our numbers, we were so many.\" The emigrants established themselves in this new star system, with \"dozens of planets and hundreds of moons\", and many of these were &lt;a href=\"terraforming\"&gt;terraformed&lt;/a&gt;, a process that was only the first step in making a planet habitable. The outlying settlements often did not receive any further support in the construction of their civilizations. This resulted in many border planets and moons having forbidding, dry environments, well-suited to the Western genre.\nSynopsis.\nThe show takes its name from the \"\"Firefly\"-class\" spaceship &lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%28Firefly%20vessel%29\"&gt;\"Serenity\"&lt;/a&gt; that the central characters call home. It resembles a &lt;a href=\"firefly\"&gt;firefly&lt;/a&gt; in general arrangement and the tail section, analogous to a &lt;a href=\"bioluminescence\"&gt;bioluminescent&lt;/a&gt; insectoid &lt;a href=\"abdomen\"&gt;abdomen&lt;/a&gt;, lights up during acceleration. The ship was named after the Battle of Serenity Valley, where Sergeant Malcolm Reynolds and Corporal Zoe Alleyne were among the survivors on the losing side. It is revealed in \"Bushwhacked\" that the Battle of Serenity Valley is widely considered to have sealed the Independents' fate.\nThe Alliance is shown to govern the star system through an organization of \"core\" planets, following its success in forcibly unifying all the colonies under one government. &lt;a href=\"Audio%20commentary%20%28DVD%29\"&gt;DVD commentary&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the Alliance is composed of two primary \"core\" systems, one predominantly &lt;a href=\"Western%20culture\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt;, the other pan-Asian, justifying the mixed linguistic and visual themes of the series. The central planets are firmly under Alliance control, but the outlying planets and moons resemble the &lt;a href=\"American%20Old%20West\"&gt;American Old West&lt;/a&gt;, under little governmental authority. Settlers and refugees on the outlying worlds have relative freedom from the central government but lack the amenities of the high-tech civilization that exists on the inner worlds. The outlying areas of space (\"the black\") are inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Reaver%20%28Firefly%29\"&gt;Reavers&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"cannibalism\"&gt;cannibalistic&lt;/a&gt; group of nomadic humans.\nThe captain of \"Serenity\" is &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Reynolds\"&gt;Malcolm \"Mal\" Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Fillion\"&gt;Nathan Fillion&lt;/a&gt;). The episode \"&lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%28Firefly%20episode%29\"&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt;\" establishes that the captain and his first mate &lt;a href=\"Zoe%20Washburne\"&gt;Zoe Washburne&lt;/a&gt;, n\u00e9e Alleyne (&lt;a href=\"Gina%20Torres\"&gt;Gina Torres&lt;/a&gt;) are veteran \"Browncoats\" of the Unification War, a failed attempt by the outlying worlds to resist the Alliance. A later episode, \"&lt;a href=\"Out%20of%20Gas%20%28Firefly%29\"&gt;Out of Gas&lt;/a&gt;\", reveals that Mal bought the spaceship \"Serenity\" to live beyond Alliance control. Much of the crew's work consists of cargo runs or &lt;a href=\"smuggling\"&gt;smuggling&lt;/a&gt;. The main story is that of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Firefly%20characters%23River%20Tam\"&gt;River Tam&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Summer%20Glau\"&gt;Summer Glau&lt;/a&gt;) and her brother &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Firefly%20characters%23Simon%20Tam\"&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sean%20Maher\"&gt;Sean Maher&lt;/a&gt;). River is a child prodigy whose brain was subjected to Alliance scientists at a secret government institution; she displays symptoms of schizophrenia and often hears voices. It is later revealed that she is a \"reader\", one who possesses &lt;a href=\"telepathic\"&gt;telepathic&lt;/a&gt; abilities. Simon gave up a career as an eminent trauma surgeon in an Alliance hospital to rescue her, and they are fugitives. In the original pilot, \"Serenity\", Simon joins the crew as a paying passenger with River smuggled on board as cargo. As Whedon states in an episode of a DVD commentary, every show he does is about creating a family. By the last episode, \"&lt;a href=\"Objects%20in%20Space\"&gt;Objects in Space&lt;/a&gt;\", the fractured character of River has finally become whole, partly because the others decided to accept her into their \"family\" on the ship.\nSignature show elements.\nThe show blends elements from the &lt;a href=\"space%20opera\"&gt;space opera&lt;/a&gt; and Western genres, depicting humanity's future in a manner different from most contemporary science fiction programs in that there are no large space battles. \"Firefly\" takes place in a multi-social future, primarily a fusion of Western and &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Asia%23East%20Asia\"&gt;East Asian societies&lt;/a&gt;, where there is gross class inequality. As a result of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%28Firefly%29\"&gt;Sino-American Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Mandarin\"&gt;Mandarin Chinese&lt;/a&gt; is a common second language; it is used in advertisements, and characters in the show frequently curse in Chinese. According to the DVD commentary on the episode \"Serenity\", this was explained as the result of China and the United States being the two superpowers that expanded into space.\nThe show features slang not used in contemporary culture, such as adaptations of modern words or new words. \"Shiny\" is frequently used as the real world slang \"cool\", and \"gorram\" is used as a mild swear word. Written and spoken Chinese, as well as Old West dialect, are also employed. As one reviewer noted: \"The dialogue tended to be a bizarre &lt;a href=\"pur%C3%A9e\"&gt;pur\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; of wisecracks, old-timey Western-paperback patois, and snatches of Chinese.\"\nTim Minear and Joss Whedon pointed out two scenes that, they believed, articulated the show's mood exceptionally clearly. One scene is in the original pilot \"Serenity\" when Mal is eating with chopsticks, and a Western tin cup is by his plate; the other is in \"The Train Job\" pilot when Mal is thrown out of a &lt;a href=\"Volumetric%20display\"&gt;holographic&lt;/a&gt; bar window. The DVD set's \"making-of\" documentary explains the distinctive &lt;a href=\"Book%20frontispiece\"&gt;frontispiece&lt;/a&gt; of the series (wherein \"Serenity\" soars over a herd of horses) as Whedon's attempt to capture \"everything you need to understand about the series in five seconds.\"\nOne of the struggles that Whedon had with Fox was the tone of the show, especially with the main character Malcolm Reynolds. Fox pressured Whedon to make Mal more \"jolly\", as they feared he was too dark in the original pilot, epitomized by the moment he suggests he might \"space\" Simon and River, throwing them out of the airlock. Fox was not happy that the show involved the \"nobodies\" who \"get squished by policy\" instead of the actual policymakers.\nCast.\nMain.\n\"Firefly\" maintained an ensemble cast that portrayed nine crew members and passengers of the ship, \"Serenity\". These characters fight criminals and schemers, Alliance security forces, the utterly psychotic and brutal Reavers, and the mysterious men with \"hands of blue\"\u2014who are operatives of a secret agency which is part of the &lt;a href=\"megacorporation\"&gt;megacorporation&lt;/a&gt; referred to in the DVD commentary only as The Blue Sun Corporation. The crew is driven by the need to secure enough income to keep their ship operational, set against their need to keep a low profile to avoid their adversaries. Their situation is incredibly complicated by the divergent motivations of the individuals on board \"Serenity\", but the show's brief run hampered complex &lt;a href=\"characterization\"&gt;characterization&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll nine of the main characters appeared in every episode, except \"&lt;a href=\"Ariel%20%28Firefly%20episode%29\"&gt;Ariel&lt;/a&gt;\", from which Book is absent.\nRecurring.\nDespite the series' short run, several &lt;a href=\"recurring%20character\"&gt;recurring character&lt;/a&gt;s emerged from the inhabitants of the \"Firefly\" universe:\nProduction.\nOrigin.\nWhedon developed the concept for the show after reading \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Killer%20Angels\"&gt;The Killer Angels&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Shaara\"&gt;Michael Shaara&lt;/a&gt; chronicling the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Gettysburg\"&gt;Battle of Gettysburg&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. He wanted to follow people who had fought on the losing side of a war, their experiences afterward as &lt;a href=\"Settlers\"&gt;pioneers&lt;/a&gt; and immigrants on the outskirts of civilization, much like the post-American Civil War era of &lt;a href=\"Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Reconstruction&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"American%20Old%20West\"&gt;American Old West&lt;/a&gt;. He intended the show to be \"a &lt;a href=\"Stagecoach%20%281939%20film%29\"&gt;\"Stagecoach\"&lt;/a&gt; kind of drama with a lot of people trying to figure out their lives in a bleak pioneer environment\". Whedon wanted to develop a show about the tactile nature of life, a show where existence was more physical and more difficult. Whedon also read a book about &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20partisan\"&gt;Jewish partisan&lt;/a&gt; fighters in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. Whedon wanted to create something for television that was more character-driven and gritty than most modern science fiction. Television science fiction, he felt, had become too pristine and rarefied. Whedon wanted to give the show a name that indicated movement and power and felt that \"Firefly\" had both. This powerful word's relatively insignificant meaning, Whedon felt, added to its allure. He eventually created a ship in the image of a firefly.\nFormat.\nDuring the pilot episode filming, Whedon was still arguing with Fox that the show should be displayed in &lt;a href=\"Widescreen%23Television\"&gt;widescreen format&lt;/a&gt;. Whedon filmed scenes with actors on the edge of both sides so that they could only be shown in widescreen. This led to a few scenes on the DVD (and later Blu-ray) where objects or setups that were not visible in the original 4:3 broadcasts were displayed\u2014such as the scene in the pilot where Wash mimes controlling the ship with a non-existent &lt;a href=\"Yoke%20%28aircraft%29\"&gt;yoke&lt;/a&gt;. The Fox executives rejected the pilot, who felt that it lacked action and that the captain was too \"dour\". They also disliked a scene in which the crew backed down to a crime boss since the scene implied the crew was \"being nothing\". Fox told Whedon on a Friday afternoon that he had to submit a new pilot script on Monday morning or the show would not be picked up. Whedon and Tim Minear closeted themselves for the weekend to write what became the new pilot, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Train%20Job\"&gt;The Train Job&lt;/a&gt;\". At the direction of Fox, they added \"larger than life\" characters such as the henchman \"Crow\" and the \"hands of blue\" men, who also introduced an \"&lt;a href=\"The%20X-Files\"&gt;X-Files&lt;/a&gt;\"-type ending.\nFor the new pilot, Fox made it clear that they would not air the episodes in widescreen. Whedon and company felt they had to \"serve two masters\" by filming widescreen for eventual DVD release but keeping objects in-frame so it could still work when aired in &lt;a href=\"pan%20and%20scan\"&gt;pan and scan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"full%20frame%20%28cinematography%29\"&gt;full frame&lt;/a&gt;. To obtain an immersive and immediate feel, the episodes were filmed in a documentary style with hand-held cameras, giving them the look of \"&lt;a href=\"found%20footage%20%28pseudo-documentary%29\"&gt;found footage&lt;/a&gt;\", with deliberately mis-framed and out-of-focus subjects. As Whedon related: \"...don't be arch, don't be sweeping\u2014be found, be rough and tumble and docu[mentary] and you-are-there\". &lt;a href=\"Computer-generated%20imagery\"&gt;Computer-generated&lt;/a&gt; scenes mimicked the motion of a hand-held camera; the style was not used when shooting scenes that involved the central government, the Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Tracking%20shot\"&gt;Tracking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steadicam\"&gt;steady cameras&lt;/a&gt; were used to show the sterility of this aspect of the \"Firefly\" universe. Another style employed was &lt;a href=\"lens%20flare\"&gt;lens flare&lt;/a&gt;s harking back to 1970s television. This style was so desired that the director of photography, &lt;a href=\"David%20Boyd%20%28cinematographer%29\"&gt;David Boyd&lt;/a&gt;, sent back the cutting-edge lenses which reduced lens flare in exchange for cheaper ones. Unlike other science fiction shows which add sound to space scenes for dramatic effect, \"Firefly\" portrays space as silent, because sounds cannot be transmitted in the vacuum of space.\nSet design.\n&lt;a href=\"Production%20designer\"&gt;Production designer&lt;/a&gt; Carey Meyer built the ship \"Serenity\" in two parts (one for each level) as a complete set with ceilings and practical lighting installed as part of the set that the cameras could use along with moveable parts. The two-part set also allowed the second unit to shoot in one section while the actors and first unit worked undisturbed in the other. As Whedon recalled: \"...you could pull it away or move something huge so that you could get in and around everything. That meant the environment worked for us and there weren't a lot of adjustments that needed to be made\". There were other benefits to this set design. One was that it allowed the viewers to feel they were really in a ship. For Whedon, the design of the ship was crucial in defining the known space for the viewer and that there were not \"fourteen hundred decks and a holodeck and an all-you-can-eat buffet in the back.\" He wanted to convey that it was utilitarian and that it was \"beat-up but lived-in. Ultimately, it was home.\" Each room represented a feeling or character, usually conveyed by the paint color. He explains that as you move from the back of the ship in the engine room, toward the front of the ship to the bridge, the colors and mood progress from extremely warm to cooler. Besides evoking a mood associated with the character who spends the most time in each area, the color scheme also alludes to the heat generated in the ship's tail. Whedon was also keen on using vertical space; having the crew quarters accessible by ladder was important. Another benefit of the set design was that it also allowed the actors to stay in the moment and interact, without having to stop after each shot and set up for the next. This helped contribute to the documentary style Whedon strove for.\nThe set had several influences, including the sliding doors and tiny cubicles reminiscent of Japanese hotels. Artist &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Dixon%20%28fantasy%20artist%29\"&gt;Larry Dixon&lt;/a&gt; has noted that the cargo bay walls are \"reminiscent of interlaced, overlapping Asian designs, cleverly reminding us of the American-Chinese Alliance setting while artistically forming a patterned plane for background scale reference.\" Dixon has also remarked on how the set design contributed to the storytelling through the use of color, depth, and composition, lighting, as well as its use of diagonals and patterned shadows.\nTheir small budget was another reason to use the ship for much of the storytelling. When the characters did go off the ship, the worlds all had Earth atmosphere and coloring because they could not afford to design alien worlds. \"I didn't want to go to &lt;a href=\"Yucca%20Flat\"&gt;Yucca Flat&lt;/a&gt;s every other episode and transform it into &lt;a href=\"Bizarro%20World\"&gt;Bizarro World&lt;/a&gt; by making the sky orange\", recalled Whedon. As Meyer recalled: \"I think in the end the feel was that we wound up using a lot of places or exteriors that just felt too Western and we didn't necessarily want to go that way; but at some point, it just became the lesser of two evils\u2014what could we actually create in three days?\"\nMusic.\n&lt;a href=\"Greg%20Edmonson\"&gt;Greg Edmonson&lt;/a&gt; composed the musical score for the series. He stated that he wrote for the emotion of the moment. A reviewer averred that he also wrote for the characters, stating: \"Edmonson has developed a specialized collection of musical symbolism for the series.\" To help illustrate the collection, the reviewer gave &lt;a href=\"leitmotif\"&gt;leitmotif&lt;/a&gt;s, or \"signatures\", various names, noting that \"Serenity\" recalls the theme of the show and is used when they return to the ship, or when they were meeting in secret; it was \"the sound of their home.\" The slide guitar and fiddle used in this piece are portable instruments that fit the lifestyle of the crew: \"the music they make calls up tunes played out in the open, by people who were hundreds of miles away yesterday. 'Serenity' conjures the nomadic lifestyle the crew leads and underlines the western aspect of the show.\" Another emotional signature was \"Sad Violin\" used at the end of the Battle of Serenity Valley but also to set up the joke when Mal tells Simon that Kaylee is dead in the episode \"&lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%28Firefly%20episode%29\"&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt;\". The most memorable use of \"Sad Violin\" is at the end of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Message%20%28Firefly%29\"&gt;The Message&lt;/a&gt;\", when the crew mourned the death of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20minor%20characters%20in%20the%20Firefly%20universe%23Tracey%20Smith\"&gt;Tracey&lt;/a&gt;. This was also the last scene of the last episode the actors shot, and so this was seen by them and Edmonson, as \"Firefly\" farewell. To denote danger, \"Peril\" was used, which is \"a low pulse, like a heartbeat, with deep chimes and low strings.\" The reviewer also noted character signatures. The criminal &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20minor%20characters%20in%20the%20Firefly%20universe%23Adelei%20Niska\"&gt;Niska&lt;/a&gt; has a signature: Eastern European or Middle Eastern melodies over a low drone. Simon and River's signature was a piano played sparsely with a violin in the background. This contrasts with the portable instruments of \"Serenity\": the piano is an instrument that cannot be easily moved and evokes the image of \"the distant house and family they both long for.\" The signatures were mostly established in the first pilot, \"Serenity\", and helped enhance the narrative.\nWhedon's use of music in his television shows has been regarded as 'filmic,' in that he has been argued to use it to remind viewers at 'pivotal moments' of earlier events, resulting in a tighter continuity throughout the season.\nThe musical score expressed the social fusion depicted in the show. &lt;a href=\"Western%20music%20%28North%20America%29\"&gt;Cowboy guitar&lt;/a&gt; blended with Asian influence produced the atmospheric background for the series. As one reviewer stated: \nThe show's theme song, \"The Ballad of Serenity\", was written by Joss Whedon and performed by &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Rhodes\"&gt;Sonny Rhodes&lt;/a&gt;. Whedon wrote the song before the series was greenlit, and a preliminary recording performed by Whedon can be found on the DVD release. The soundtrack to the series was released on CD on November 8, 2005, by &lt;a href=\"Var%C3%A8se%20Sarabande\"&gt;Var\u00e8se Sarabande&lt;/a&gt;. However, Fox Music released a 40-minute soundtrack in September 2005 as a digital EP. \"The Ballad of Serenity\" was used by NASA as the wake-up song for astronaut &lt;a href=\"Robert%20L.%20Behnken\"&gt;Robert L. Behnken&lt;/a&gt; and the other crewmembers of &lt;a href=\"STS-130\"&gt;STS-130&lt;/a&gt; on February 12, 2010.\nCasting.\nIn casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked first at the actors and considered their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, \"So then he just sort of put us all together, and I think it was very quick like right out of the gate, we all instantly bonded.\" All nine cast members were chosen before filming began; while making the original pilot \"Serenity\", Whedon decided that &lt;a href=\"Rebecca%20Gayheart\"&gt;Rebecca Gayheart&lt;/a&gt; was unsuitable for the role of &lt;a href=\"Inara%20Serra\"&gt;Inara Serra&lt;/a&gt;, and shot her scenes in singles so that it would be easier to replace her. &lt;a href=\"Morena%20Baccarin\"&gt;Morena Baccarin&lt;/a&gt; auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. \"Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me\", Baccarin recalled.\nWhedon approached &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Fillion\"&gt;Nathan Fillion&lt;/a&gt; to play the lead role of &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Reynolds\"&gt;Malcolm Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;; after Whedon explained the premise and showed him the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role. Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that \"it was really thrilling. It was my first lead, and I was pretty nervous, but I really wanted that part, and I wanted to tell those stories.\" Fillion later said he was \"heartbroken\" when he learned the series had been canceled. Fillion has called his time on \"Firefly\" the best acting job he ever had, and compares every job he has had to it.\n&lt;a href=\"Alan%20Tudyk\"&gt;Alan Tudyk&lt;/a&gt; applied through a casting office and several months later was called in for an audition, where he met with Whedon. He was called back to test with two candidates for the role of Zoe (Wash's wife) and was told that it was down to him and one other candidate. The Zoes he tested with were not selected (Gina Torres eventually received the role), and Tudyk was sent home but received a call informing him he had the part anyway. His audition tape is included in the special features of the DVD release.\n&lt;a href=\"Gina%20Torres\"&gt;Gina Torres&lt;/a&gt;, a veteran of several science fiction/fantasy works (\"&lt;a href=\"Cleopatra%202525\"&gt;Cleopatra 2525&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Matrix%20Reloaded\"&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Alias%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Alias&lt;/a&gt;\", \"\"), was at first uninterested in doing another science fiction show but \"was won over by the quality of the source material\". As she recalled, \"you had these challenged characters inhabiting a challenging world, and that makes for great storytelling. And no aliens!\"\nFor &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Baldwin\"&gt;Adam Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;, who grew up watching westerns, the role of &lt;a href=\"Jayne%20Cobb\"&gt;Jayne Cobb&lt;/a&gt; was particularly resonant.\nCanadian actress &lt;a href=\"Jewel%20Staite\"&gt;Jewel Staite&lt;/a&gt; videotaped her audition from &lt;a href=\"Vancouver\"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; and was asked to come to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; to meet Whedon, at which point she was cast for the role of &lt;a href=\"Kaylee%20Frye\"&gt;Kaylee Frye&lt;/a&gt;, the ship's engineer.\n&lt;a href=\"Sean%20Maher\"&gt;Sean Maher&lt;/a&gt; recalls reading for the part and liking the character of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Firefly%20characters%23Simon%20Tam\"&gt;Simon Tam&lt;/a&gt;, but that it was Whedon's personality and vision that \"sealed the deal\" for him. For the role of Simon's sister, &lt;a href=\"River%20Tam\"&gt;River Tam&lt;/a&gt;, Whedon called in &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Glau\"&gt;Summer Glau&lt;/a&gt; for an audition and test the same day. Glau had first worked for Whedon in the \"Angel\" episode \"&lt;a href=\"Waiting%20in%20the%20Wings%20%28Angel%20episode%29\"&gt;Waiting in the Wings&lt;/a&gt;\". Two weeks later, Whedon called her to tell her she had the part.\nVeteran television actor &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Glass\"&gt;Ron Glass&lt;/a&gt; has said that until \"Firefly\", he had not experienced or sought a science-fiction or western role. Still, he fell in love with the pilot script and the character of &lt;a href=\"Derrial%20Book\"&gt;Shepherd Book&lt;/a&gt;.\nProduction staff.\nWhedon selected Tim Minear to be the &lt;a href=\"show%20runner\"&gt;show runner&lt;/a&gt;, who serves as the head writer and production leader. According to Whedon, \"[Minear] understood the show as well as any human being, and just brought so much to it that I think of it as though he were always a part of it.\" Many of the other production staff were selected from people Whedon had worked with in the past, except the director of photography David Boyd, who was the \"big find\" and who was \"full of joy and energy.\"\nThe writers were selected after interviews and script samplings. Among the writers were &lt;a href=\"Jose%20Molina%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Molina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Edlund\"&gt;Ben Edlund&lt;/a&gt;, Cheryl Cain, &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Matthews\"&gt;Brett Matthews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drew%20Z.%20Greenberg\"&gt;Drew Z. Greenberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Espenson\"&gt;Jane Espenson&lt;/a&gt;. Espenson wrote an essay on the writing process with Mutant Enemy Productions. A meeting is held and an idea is floated, generally by Whedon, and the writers brainstorm to develop the central theme of the episode and the character development. Next, the writers (except the one working on the previous week's episode) meet in the anteroom to Whedon's office to begin 'breaking' the story into acts and scenes. One of the key components to devising acts for the team is deciding where to break for commercial and ensuring the viewer returns. \"Finding these moments in the story help give it shape: think of them as tentpoles that support the structure.\" For instance, in \"&lt;a href=\"Shindig%20%28Firefly%29\"&gt;Shindig&lt;/a&gt;\", the break for commercial occurs when Malcolm Reynolds is gravely injured and losing the duel. \"It does not end when Mal turns the fight around when he stands victorious over his opponent. They're both big moments, but one of them leaves you curious, and the other doesn't.\"\nNext, the writers develop the scenes onto a marker-filled whiteboard, featuring \"a brief ordered description of each scene.\" A writer is selected to create an outline of the episode's concept\u2014occasionally with some dialogue and jokes\u2014in one day. The outline is given to showrunner Tim Minear, who revises it within a day. The writer uses the revised outline to write the first draft of the script while the other writers develop the next. This first draft is usually submitted for revision within three to fourteen days; afterward, a second and sometimes third draft is written. After all modifications are made, the final draft would be produced as the 'shooting draft.'\nCostume.\nJill Ohanneson, \"Firefly\"s original costume designer, brought on &lt;a href=\"Shawna%20Trpcic\"&gt;Shawna Trpcic&lt;/a&gt; as her assistant for the pilot. When the show was picked up, Ohanneson was involved in another job and declined \"Firefly\", suggesting Trpcic for the job.\nThe costumes were chiefly influenced by &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the American &lt;a href=\"Old%20West\"&gt;Old West&lt;/a&gt;, and 1861 &lt;a href=\"samurai\"&gt;samurai&lt;/a&gt; Japan. Trpcic used deep reds and oranges for the main cast to express a feeling of \"home\" and contrasted that with grays and cool blues for the Alliance. Since the characters were often getting shot, Trpcic would make up to six versions of the same costume for multiple takes.\nUnproduced episodes.\nSince the cancellation of the series, various cast and crew members have revealed details they had planned for the show's future:\nBroadcast history.\n\"Firefly\" consists of a two-hour pilot and thirteen one-hour episodes (with commercials). The series originally premiered in the United States on Fox in September 2002. The episodes were aired out of the intended order. Although Whedon had designed the show to run for seven years, low ratings resulted in cancellation by Fox in December 2002 after only 11 of the 14 completed episodes had aired in the United States. The three episodes unaired by Fox eventually debuted in 2003 on the &lt;a href=\"Syfy%20%28UK%20and%20Ireland%29\"&gt;Sci Fi Channel&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom. Prior to cancellation, some fans, worried about low ratings, formed the \"Firefly\" Immediate Assistance campaign whose goal was to support the production of the show by sending in postcards to Fox. After it was canceled, the campaign worked on getting another network such as &lt;a href=\"United%20Paramount%20Network\"&gt;UPN&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the series. The campaign was unsuccessful in securing the show's continuation.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20A.V.%20Club\"&gt;The A.V. Club&lt;/a&gt;\" cited several actions by the Fox network that contributed to the show's failure, most notably airing the episodes out of sequence, making the plot more difficult to follow. For instance, the double episode \"Serenity\" was intended as the &lt;a href=\"premiere\"&gt;premiere&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore contained most of the character introductions and &lt;a href=\"back-story\"&gt;back-story&lt;/a&gt;. However, Fox decided that \"Serenity\" was unsuitable for opening the series, and \"The Train Job\" was specifically created to act as a new pilot. In addition, \"Firefly\" was promoted as an &lt;a href=\"Action%20film\"&gt;action&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Comedy%20film\"&gt;comedy&lt;/a&gt; rather than the more serious character study it was intended to be, and the showbiz trade paper \"&lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;\" noted Fox's decision to occasionally preempt the show for sporting events.\nFox remastered the complete series in &lt;a href=\"1080i\"&gt;1080i&lt;/a&gt; high-definition for broadcast on &lt;a href=\"Universal%20HD\"&gt;Universal HD&lt;/a&gt;, which began in April 2008.\nOn March 12, 2009, the series was the winner of the first annual Hulu awards in the category \"Shows We'd Bring Back\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Science%20Channel\"&gt;Science Channel&lt;/a&gt; began airing the series on March 6, 2011. All episodes aired in the intended order, including episodes \"Trash\", \"The Message\" and \"Heart of Gold\", which were not aired in the original Fox series run. Along with each episode, Dr. &lt;a href=\"Michio%20Kaku\"&gt;Michio Kaku&lt;/a&gt; provided commentary about the real-life science behind the show's science fiction.\nHome media releases.\nA box set containing the 14 completed episodes (including those which had not yet aired in the United States) was released on region 1 &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; on December 9, 2003, region 2 on April 19, 2004, and region 4 on August 2, 2004. The box features the episodes in the original order in which the show's producers had intended them to be broadcast, as well as seven episode commentaries, outtakes and other features. The DVDs feature the episodes as they were shot in &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20ratio%20%28image%29\"&gt;16:9&lt;/a&gt; widescreen, with &lt;a href=\"Anamorphic%20widescreen\"&gt;anamorphic&lt;/a&gt; transfers and &lt;a href=\"Dolby%20Surround\"&gt;Dolby Surround&lt;/a&gt; audio. By September 2005, its DVD release had sold about 500,000 copies.\nThe series was re-released on &lt;a href=\"Blu-ray%20Disc\"&gt;Blu-ray Disc&lt;/a&gt; on November 11, 2008, comprising three discs; exclusive extras to the Blu-ray release include extra audio commentary from Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk and Ron Glass for the episode \"Our Mrs. Reynolds\", as well as an additional featurette, \"\"Firefly\" Reunion: Lunch with Joss, Nathan, Alan and Ron\". On September 19, 2017, the series was reissued on Blu-ray as a \"15th Anniversary Collection.\" The set included new packaging that came with &lt;a href=\"Postcard\"&gt;character cards&lt;/a&gt; and a fold-out &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; of the solar system in which the series is set.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Tomatoes\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, the series has an approval rating of 77% with an average score of 7.8 out of 10 based on 44 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Firefly\" earns its audience's adoration with the help of Nathan Fillion's dry delivery, a detailed fantasy world, and compelling storylines \u2013 even if it doesn't stand with creator Joss Whedon's most consistent work.\"\nMany reviews focused on the show's fusion of Wild West and outer space motifs. \"&lt;a href=\"TV%20Guide\"&gt;TV Guide&lt;/a&gt;\"s Matt Roush, for instance, called the show \"oddball\" and \"offbeat\" and noted how the series took the metaphor of space operas as Westerns. Roush opined that the shift from space travel to horseback was \"jarring\", but that once he got used to this, he found the characters cleverly conceived and the writing a crisp balance of action, tension, and humor. Several reviewers, however, criticized the show's setting; Tim Goodman of the \"&lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Chronicle\"&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\" felt that the melding of the western and science fiction genres was a \"forced hodgepodge of two alarmingly opposite genres just for the sake of being different\" and called the series a \"vast disappointment\", and Carina Chocano of &lt;a href=\"Salon.com\"&gt;Salon.com&lt;/a&gt; said that while the \"space as &lt;a href=\"Wild%20West\"&gt;Wild West&lt;/a&gt;\" metaphor is fairly redundant, neither genre connected to the present. Emily Nussbaum of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\", reviewing the DVD set, noted that the program featured \"an oddball genre mix that might have doomed it from the beginning: it was a character-rich sci-fi western comedy-drama with existential underpinnings, a hard sell during a season dominated by \"&lt;a href=\"Joe%20Millionaire\"&gt;Joe Millionaire&lt;/a&gt;\"\".\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Boston%20Globe\"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt;\" described \"Firefly\" as a \"wonderful, imaginative mess brimming with possibility\". The review further notes the difference between the new series and other programs was that those shows \"burst onto the scene with slick pilots and quickly deteriorate into mediocrity... \"Firefly\" is on the opposite creative journey.\" Jason Snell called the show one of the best on television, and one \"with the most potential for future brilliance\".\nTim White, writing for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Objective%20Standard\"&gt;The Objective Standard&lt;/a&gt;\", focused his review on the show's depiction of heroism. He concludes that \"\"Firefly\" is not perfectly accurate in its attempts to depict the essential natures of heroism and villainy, but its successes are much more uplifting than its failures are problematic. It's also consistently funny, skillfully written, and passionately acted.\"\nReviewers also compared \"Firefly\" to Whedon's other series, \"&lt;a href=\"Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/a&gt;\". Chocano noted that the series lacks the psychological tension of \"Buffy\" and suggests that this might be attributable to the episodes being aired out of order. &lt;a href=\"MSN\"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, pointed out that after viewing the DVD boxed set, it was easy to see why the program had attracted many die-hard fans. \"All of Whedon's fingerprints are there: the witty dialogue, the quirky premises and dark exploration of human fallacy that made \"Buffy\" brilliant found their way to this space drama\".\nReviewers also criticized the predominant use of a heavily Chinese-influenced setting and culture while Asian characters in the show were \"practically nonexistent\". Writing for &lt;a href=\"Syfy\"&gt;Syfy&lt;/a&gt;, Alyssa Fikse described the show as a \"problematic fave\", calling the lack of Asian characters in the show \"negligent at best, racist at worst.\" Mike Le of \"Racebending.com\" opined that Asians in \"Firefly\" were \"virtually faceless, and completely voiceless, in a universe that is supposed to represent a Sino-American future.\" Sara Casaus of \"Film Daily\" noted, \"For a world that's half Chinese, there's a bewildering lack of Chinese people.\"\nFandom.\n\"Firefly\" generated a loyal base of fans during its three-month original broadcast run on &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt; in late 2002. These fans, self-styled Browncoats, used &lt;a href=\"Internet%20forum\"&gt;online forums&lt;/a&gt; to organize and try to save the series from being canceled by Fox only three months after its debut. Their efforts included raising money for an ad in &lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;\"Variety\" magazine&lt;/a&gt; and a postcard writing campaign to &lt;a href=\"UPN\"&gt;UPN&lt;/a&gt;. While unsuccessful in finding a network that would continue the show, their support led to a release of the series on &lt;a href=\"DVD\"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; in December 2003. A subsequent fan campaign raised over $14,000 in donations to have a purchased \"Firefly\" DVD set placed aboard 250 U.S. Navy ships by April 2004 for recreational viewing by their crews.\nThese and other continuing fan activities eventually persuaded Universal Studios to produce a feature film, \"Serenity\". (The title of \"Serenity\" was chosen, according to Whedon, because Fox still owned the rights to the name 'Firefly'). Numerous early screenings of rough film cuts were held for existing fans starting in May 2005 as an attempt to create a buzz to increase ticket sales when the final film cut was released widely on September 30, 2005. The film was not as commercially successful as fans had hoped, opening at number two and making only $40 million worldwide during its initial theatrical release.\nOn June 23, 2006, fans organized the first worldwide charity screenings of \"Serenity\" in 47 cities, dubbed as Can't Stop the Serenity or CSTS, an homage to the movie's tagline, \"Can't stop the signal\". The event raised over $65,000 for Whedon's favorite charity, &lt;a href=\"Equality%20Now\"&gt;Equality Now&lt;/a&gt;. In 2007, $106,000 was raised; in 2008, $107,219; and in 2009, $137,331.\nIn July 2006, a &lt;a href=\"fan-made\"&gt;fan-made&lt;/a&gt; documentary was released, titled \"&lt;a href=\"Done%20the%20Impossible\"&gt;Done the Impossible&lt;/a&gt;\", and is commercially available. The documentary relates the story of the fans and how the show has affected them, and features interviews with Whedon and various cast members. Part of the DVD proceeds are donated to &lt;a href=\"Equality%20Now\"&gt;Equality Now&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"NASA\"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; Browncoat &lt;a href=\"astronaut\"&gt;astronaut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Swanson\"&gt;Steven Swanson&lt;/a&gt; took the \"Firefly\" and \"Serenity\" DVDs with him on &lt;a href=\"Space%20Shuttle%20Atlantis\"&gt;Space Shuttle Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"STS-117\"&gt;STS-117&lt;/a&gt; mission in June 2007. The DVDs were added to the media collection on the &lt;a href=\"International%20Space%20Station\"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; as entertainment for the station's crews.\nA fan-made, not-for-profit, unofficial sequel to \"Serenity\", titled \"Browncoats: Redemption\", premiered at &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Con\"&gt;Dragon*Con 2010&lt;/a&gt; on September 4, 2010. According to the film's creator and producer, Whedon gave \"his blessing\" to the project. The film was sold on DVD and Blu-ray at the film's website, with all proceeds being distributed among five charities. The film was also screened at various science-fiction conventions across the United States, with admission receipts similarly being donated. All sales ended on September 1, 2011, one year after its premiere, with total revenues exceeding $115,000.\nCult status.\nIn 2005, \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Scientist\"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine's website held an internet poll to find \"The World's Best Space Sci-Fi Ever\". \"Firefly\" came in first place, with its cinematic follow-up \"Serenity\" in second. In 2012, \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\" listed the show at No. 11 in the \"25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years\", commenting, \"as it often does, martyrdom has only enhanced its legend.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Brad%20Wright\"&gt;Brad Wright&lt;/a&gt;, co-creator of \"&lt;a href=\"Stargate%20SG-1\"&gt;Stargate SG-1&lt;/a&gt;\" has said that the &lt;a href=\"200%20%28Stargate%20SG-1%29\"&gt;200th&lt;/a&gt; episode of SG-1 is \"a little kiss to \"Serenity\" and \"Firefly\", which was possibly one of the best canceled series in history\". In the episode, \"Martin Lloyd has come to the S.G.C. [Stargate Command] because even though '&lt;a href=\"Wormhole%20X-Treme%21\"&gt;Wormhole X-Treme!&lt;/a&gt;' was canceled after three episodes, it did so well on DVD they're making a feature [film]\". The follow-up film, \"&lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%282005%20film%29\"&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt;\", was voted the best science fiction movie of all time in an &lt;a href=\"SFX%20magazine\"&gt;\"SFX\" magazine&lt;/a&gt; poll of 3,000 fans. \"Firefly\" was later ranked #25 on \"TV Guide\"s Top Cult Shows Ever. The name for the Google beta app &lt;a href=\"Google%20Wave\"&gt;Google Wave&lt;/a&gt; was inspired by this TV series.\nIn an interview on February 17, 2011, with \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Fillion\"&gt;Nathan Fillion&lt;/a&gt; joked that: \"If I got $300 million from the California Lottery, the first thing I would do is buy the rights to \"Firefly\", make it on my own, and distribute it on the Internet\". This quickly gave rise to a fan-run initiative to raising the funds to purchase the rights. On March 7, 2011, the organizers announced the closure of the project due to lack of endorsement from the creators, with $1 million pledged at the time it was shut down.\nJoss Whedon, Tim Minear, and cast members Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, Summer Glau, Adam Baldwin, and Sean Maher reunited at the 2012 &lt;a href=\"San%20Diego%20Comic-Con\"&gt;San Diego Comic-Con&lt;/a&gt; for a 10th-anniversary panel. Ten thousand people lined up to get into the panel, and the panel ended with the entire crowd giving the cast and crew a standing ovation.\nA tenth anniversary special, \"Browncoats Unite\", was shown on the &lt;a href=\"Science%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;Science Channel&lt;/a&gt; on November 11, 2012. The special featured Whedon, Minear, and several of the cast members, in a discussion on the series' history.\nAccording to \"&lt;a href=\"Reason%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Reason&lt;/a&gt;\"s &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Sanchez%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Julian Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, \"Firefly\"s cult following \"seems to include a disproportionate number of libertarians.\" The story themes are often cautionary about too-powerful central authority and its capacity to do bad while being considered by the majority as good. The characters each exhibit traits that exemplify core &lt;a href=\"libertarianism\"&gt;libertarian&lt;/a&gt; values, such as the &lt;a href=\"right%20to%20bear%20arms\"&gt;right to bear arms&lt;/a&gt; (Jayne, Zoe), &lt;a href=\"legal%20prostitution\"&gt;legal prostitution&lt;/a&gt; (Inara), &lt;a href=\"freedom%20of%20religion\"&gt;freedom of religion&lt;/a&gt; (Book), logic and reasoning (Simon), and &lt;a href=\"anti-conscription\"&gt;anti-conscription&lt;/a&gt; (River). Joss Whedon notes this theme, saying \"Mal is, if not a Republican, certainly a libertarian, he's certainly a less-government kinda guy. He's the opposite of me in many ways.\"\nPodcasts.\n\"The Signal\" is a \"Firefly\" and \"Serenity\"-focused podcast developed by fans of the Joss Whedon property. Hosted by Kari Haley and Les Howard, \"The Signal\" is a &lt;a href=\"fan%20labor\"&gt;fan-driven&lt;/a&gt; podcast dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Joss%20Whedon\"&gt;Joss Whedon&lt;/a&gt;'s short-lived TV series \"Firefly\" (2002) and its film &lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%282005%20film%29\"&gt;\"Serenity\"&lt;/a&gt; (2005). Initially created as &lt;a href=\"guerrilla%20marketing\"&gt;guerrilla marketing&lt;/a&gt; to promote \"Serenity\", the podcast features discussions about the franchise's &lt;a href=\"role-playing%20game\"&gt;role-playing game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fan%20fiction\"&gt;fan fiction&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"radio%20drama\"&gt;audio dramas&lt;/a&gt;, and interviews (e.g. with &lt;a href=\"PJ%20Haarsma\"&gt;PJ Haarsma&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Espenson\"&gt;Jane Espenson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Marc%20Gunn\"&gt;Marc Gunn&lt;/a&gt;). Haley and Howard described the podcast's purpose as \"[doing] whatever we can to see that more new \"Firefly\" is created in any format.\"\nIn early 2006, &lt;a href=\"Mur%20Lafferty\"&gt;Mur Lafferty&lt;/a&gt; described the show as \"&lt;a href=\"Motion%20Picture%20Association%20film%20rating%20system%23MPA%20film%20ratings\"&gt;PG-rated&lt;/a&gt;\", about an hour long, and publishing an episode every two weeks. That December, \"The Signal\" released a &lt;a href=\"compilation%20album\"&gt;compilation album&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"filk%20music\"&gt;filk music&lt;/a&gt; that had previously featured on the podcast: \"Songs from the Black\"; the album featured music by &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Ski\"&gt;Luke Ski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28band%29\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Edmonson\"&gt;Greg Edmonson&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2006, \"The Signal\" received a &lt;a href=\"Podcast%20Awards\"&gt;People's Choice Podcast Award&lt;/a&gt; in the categories of \"TV &amp; Film\" and \"Best Produced\"; it received the former again in 2008. \"The Signal\" was awarded the 2007 &lt;a href=\"Parsec%20Awards\"&gt;Parsec Award&lt;/a&gt; for \"Best Fan Podcast\", and in the category of \"Best Speculative Fiction Fan or News Podcast (Specific)\", it won the 2010 and 2012 Parsecs. Writing for &lt;a href=\"Maximum%20Fun\"&gt;Maximum Fun&lt;/a&gt;, Ian Brill praised \"The Signal\" as surprisingly professional with well-produced segments, though he unflatteringly compared Haley and Howard to Whedon's character &lt;a href=\"Xander%20Harris\"&gt;Xander Harris&lt;/a&gt;: \"They say mildly clever and cutesy things to each other and then sound tremendously satisfied with themselves while saying it.\"\nAwards.\n\"Firefly\" won the following awards:\nThe series was also nominated for the following awards:\nRatings.\nAt the time the series was canceled by Fox, it averaged 4.7 million viewers and ranked 98th in &lt;a href=\"Nielsen%20ratings\"&gt;Nielsen ratings&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn popular culture.\nThe cancellation of \"Firefly\" is a running gag in the &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; sitcom, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory\"&gt;The Big Bang Theory&lt;/a&gt;\", which ran from 2007-2019. The character &lt;a href=\"Sheldon%20Cooper\"&gt;Sheldon Cooper&lt;/a&gt; is a fan of the show. When he and &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Hofstadter\"&gt;Leonard Hofstadter&lt;/a&gt; discuss their roommate agreement, they include a passage in which they dedicate Friday nights to watching \"Firefly\", as Sheldon believes it will last for years. Upon its cancellation, he brands &lt;a href=\"Rupert%20Murdoch\"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;, the owner of &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt;, a traitor. During the show's second season, in episode 17 (\"The Terminator Decoupling\"), &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Glau\"&gt;Summer Glau&lt;/a&gt; appears as herself, encountering Sheldon, Leonard, and their friends on a train to San Francisco. When Raj tries to hit on her, he says that although he is an astrophysicist, she was actually in space during the shooting of \"Firefly\". Glau chides him for believing this, and Raj backtracks, saying, \"Those are crazy people!\"\nOn the &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; comedy \"&lt;a href=\"Community%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Community&lt;/a&gt;\", the characters &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Community%20characters%23Troy%20Barnes\"&gt;Troy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Community%20characters%23Abed%20Nadir\"&gt;Abed&lt;/a&gt; are fans of the show. They have an agreement that if one of them dies, the other will stage it to look like a suicide caused by the cancellation of \"Firefly\", in the hopes that it will bring the show back.\nIn the 2003 \"&lt;a href=\"Battlestar%20Galactica%20%28TV%20miniseries%29\"&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/a&gt;\" miniseries/pilot, a ship resembling \"Serenity\" appears in the background of the scene with &lt;a href=\"Laura%20Roslin\"&gt;Laura Roslin&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Mary%20McDonnell\"&gt;Mary McDonnell&lt;/a&gt;). \"Serenity\" is one of several spaceships inserted as cameos into digital effects scenes by &lt;a href=\"Zoic%20Studios\"&gt;Zoic Studios&lt;/a&gt;, the company responsible for digital effects in both \"Firefly\" and \"Battlestar Galactica\".\nThe webcomic \"&lt;a href=\"xkcd\"&gt;xkcd&lt;/a&gt;\" commented on \"Firefly\"'s conspicuous absence of Asian characters in the 2009 comic \"Well\". When a character drops a coin into \"The Uncomfortable Truths Well\", it responds, \"For a universe that's supposed to be half Chinese, \"Firefly\" sure doesn't have any Asians.\"\nCritics have drawn comparisons and parallels between \"Firefly\" and the anime \"&lt;a href=\"Outlaw%20Star\"&gt;Outlaw Star&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe television series \"&lt;a href=\"Castle%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Castle&lt;/a&gt;\", where Fillion plays the lead character &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Castle\"&gt;Richard Castle&lt;/a&gt;, has made ongoing &lt;a href=\"Homage%20%28arts%29\"&gt;homage&lt;/a&gt;s to \"Firefly\". Castle has props from \"Firefly\" as decorative items in his home, has dressed up as a \"space cowboy\" for Halloween (\"You wore that five years ago\", cracked his daughter), speaks Chinese that he learned from \"a TV show [he] loved\", and has made rapid \"two-by-two\" finger motions while wearing blue surgical gloves. He has been humorously asked if he has ever heard of a spa known as \"Serenity\", and \"Firefly\" catchphrases such as \"shiny\", \"special hell\", and \"I was aiming for the head\" have been used as punchlines during various dramatic scenes in \"Castle\". He has worked a murder case at a science fiction convention with suspects being the cast of a long-cancelled space opera that only ran for a season, and has had direct and incidental interaction with people portrayed by \"Firefly\" cast members.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Con%20Man%20%28web%20series%29\"&gt;Con Man&lt;/a&gt;\", a 2015 comedy web series created by Tudyk and co-produced by Fillion, draws on the pair's experiences as cult science fiction actors touring the &lt;a href=\"Fan%20convention\"&gt;convention&lt;/a&gt; circuit. Though it is not autobiographical, the show's fictional \"Spectrum\" echoes \"Firefly\" and Tudyk's and Fillion's roles reflect their own \"Firefly\" roles. Staite, Torres, Glau, Maher, and Whedon made guest appearances. Maher played himself as a former \"Firefly\" actor.\nMedia franchise.\nThe popularity of the short-lived series served as the launching point for a &lt;a href=\"media%20franchise\"&gt;media franchise&lt;/a&gt; within the \"Firefly\" universe, including the feature film \"&lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%282005%20film%29\"&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt;\", which addresses many plot points left unresolved by the series' cancellation.\nAdditionally, there are &lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%28comics%29\"&gt;two comic-book mini-series&lt;/a&gt;, ' (3 issues, 104 pages, 2006), ' (3 issues, 80 pages, 2008) and a one-shot hardcover \"&lt;a href=\"Serenity%20%28comics%29%23The%20Shepherd%27s%20Tale\"&gt;Serenity: The Shepherd's Tale&lt;/a&gt;\" (56 pages, 2010), along with the one-shots \"Serenity: Downtime and The Other Half\" and \"Serenity: Float Out\" in which Whedon explored plot strands he had intended to explore further in the series. The comics are set, in plot terms, between the end of the TV series and the opening of the feature film. The two mini-series were later published in collected form as hardcover and paperback graphic novels. A six-issue series titled \"Serenity: Leaves on the Wind\" began in January 2014 and the series takes place after the events of the film. A six-issue series titled \"Serenity: No Power in the 'Verse\" began in October 2016 and the series is set about 1.5 years after \"Leaves on the Wind\". In July 2018, &lt;a href=\"Boom%21%20Studios\"&gt;Boom! Studios&lt;/a&gt; announced that they had acquired the comic book and graphic novel publishing license to \"Firefly\" with plans to release new monthly comic book series, limited series, original graphic novels, and more.\nIn July 2014, the release of the video game \"&lt;a href=\"Firefly%20Online\"&gt;Firefly Online&lt;/a&gt;\" was announced that planned to have the cast reprise their roles.\nIn January 2018, &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Publishing%20Group\"&gt;Titan Books&lt;/a&gt; announced that they would begin publishing original canon \"Firefly\" novels. Five books have so far been released."
