    "text": "Gravesend Grammar School is a selective &lt;a href=\"grammar%20school\"&gt;grammar school&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Academy%20%28English%20school%29\"&gt;academy status&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Gravesend%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Gravesend, Kent&lt;/a&gt;, England. The school accepts boys at age 11 by &lt;a href=\"Eleven-plus%20exam\"&gt;examination&lt;/a&gt; accepting a cohort of the top 15-20% and boys and girls at 16, based on their &lt;a href=\"GCSE\"&gt;GCSE&lt;/a&gt; results. The school continues to strive achieving around 100%(5 A*-C including English and Maths) at GCSE level with many students obtaining &gt;9 GCSEs at the end of Year 11.\nSchool.\nGravesend Grammar School was opened by &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Beatrice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Princess Beatrice of Battenberg&lt;/a&gt;, youngest daughter of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, on 19 July 1893 with due pomp and ceremony. The school was originally based in Darnley Road, &lt;a href=\"Gravesend%2C%20Kent\"&gt;Gravesend&lt;/a&gt; and later moved to the site of Milton Hall, the former home of &lt;a href=\"Mayor\"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt; G. M. Arnold , one of the school's founders. The original building is currently used as an adult education centre. The replacement building, erected between 1931 and 1938 and officially opened on 12 October 1938, is still in use. Although many alterations and additions have been made to it since it was originally constructed, including being partly rebuilt after being bombed during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, having been mistaken for &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton College&lt;/a&gt;.\nA second school building, known as the Centenary Building, was built in 1993 to commemorate the school's 100th year and currently houses facilities including multiple computer facilities and chemistry labs. There are a number of mobile classrooms around the school site, used for various subjects, although these are beginning to be replaced by more permanent buildings.\nIn July 2009 a new sports centre was opened, adjacent to the sports hall, and named the Sanderson Sports Centre, after a former &lt;a href=\"headmaster\"&gt;headmaster&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, there are 63 classrooms, including six computer rooms, all of which contain &lt;a href=\"interactive%20whiteboard\"&gt;interactive whiteboard&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as a library, a sports hall, several small music practice rooms and a canteen available to all staff and pupils. In 2013 the main school and the Centenary Building were linked by a new building containing eight new classrooms including a large art room and a lecture theatre. In 2016, a new music block was opened opposite a computer facility. This new music block has many new features and is a vast improvement on its predecessor. There are 3 practice rooms, a recording studio and a main room for clubs and other musical activities.\nIn 2004 the school gained specialist status as a maths and computing specialist school. This guarantees the school extra government funding in order to continue the running and expansion of its facilities. The school also gained language specialist status, in 2008.\nOn 1 August 2011 the school became an &lt;a href=\"Academy%20%28English%20school%29\"&gt;Academy Trust&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse system.\nIn 1926 the present &lt;a href=\"house%20system\"&gt;house system&lt;/a&gt; was introduced replacing the former houses of &lt;a href=\"Goths\"&gt;Goths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vikings\"&gt;Vikings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saxons\"&gt;Saxons&lt;/a&gt;. Originally the pupils in each year group were divided into four houses reflecting where they lived. This distinction no longer applies with the choice of house now often linked to family connections:\nIn 1993 to reflect the growing size of the school, a fifth &lt;a href=\"house%20system\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; was established:\nIn 2012 a sixth &lt;a href=\"house%20system\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; was formed:\nThe 2009-year group also included a Fleet House form. Originally called (Rain)Bow the 30 pupils belonged to the older five houses; in 2012 these pupils received Fleet House ties replacing their original House tie.\nHead Boy team and prefects.\nEach year, a &lt;a href=\"head%20boy\"&gt;head boy&lt;/a&gt; and a team of five deputies are elected from the Lower Sixth (Year 12). Several weeks before the Easter holiday, any student wishing to stand for either position must submit a &lt;a href=\"manifesto\"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; to the Head of Year. &lt;a href=\"Hustings\"&gt;Hustings&lt;/a&gt; are then held, in which the candidates put forward their ideas and reasons for wishing to be elected. The Year 12 group and staff vote then for their choices for head boy and deputies. The candidates with the most votes then have an interview with the headteacher and the successful candidates are announced just before the term ends. As the school now has a mixed Sixth Form the team is also mixed.\nThere is a number of school &lt;a href=\"prefect\"&gt;prefect&lt;/a&gt;s, ranging from subject prefects to pastoral ones in charge of areas of the school such as the library or the canteen. There is a dedicated team of about 15 students to ensure appropriate use of ICT facilities at break and lunchtimes. All members of the prefect and head boy teams are issued a blue shield-shaped badge engraved with their position.\nSixth form.\nThe Sixth Form currently contains approximately 300 students, studying &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Level%20%28UK%29\"&gt;A Levels&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of subjects. Each week there is a \"General Education\" session for the Lower Sixth, attracting various speakers, such as local &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Holloway\"&gt;Adam Holloway&lt;/a&gt; or, for example, representatives from Israeli and Palestinian Support Charities. The school also provides free \"Driveability\" sessions for the Year 12 students that outline the various risks and responsibilities of learning to drive. There are several extracurricular clubs specifically for the Sixth Form, including an &lt;a href=\"CompTIA%20A%2B\"&gt;A+&lt;/a&gt; computing course, and a Film Club.\nCareers.\nPupils begin to prepare for career choices in Year 9, where they start to have one lesson a fortnight being taught various aspects of careers, including interview techniques and how to write &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9\"&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;s. These lessons continue until the end of Year 11. In addition, all Year 11 pupils have a week's &lt;a href=\"work%20experience\"&gt;work experience&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of organisations, ranging from local schools to companies in Kent and in London. They also have group careers interviews with a &lt;a href=\"Connexions%20%28agency%29\"&gt;Connexions&lt;/a&gt; advisor, with one on one sessions if requested. The school has a Careers Library that any student can use, containing &lt;a href=\"prospectus%20%28university%29\"&gt;prospectae&lt;/a&gt; and information from various &lt;a href=\"universities\"&gt;universities&lt;/a&gt;, as well as information about possible career paths.\nSport.\nSport plays a very big part of life at the school with all GCSE students taking &lt;a href=\"physical%20education\"&gt;physical education&lt;/a&gt; short courses. There are a number of specialist PE teachers who coach a variety of teams, including &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt;, football, &lt;a href=\"badminton\"&gt;badminton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"field%20hockey\"&gt;hockey&lt;/a&gt;, as well as facilities for &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"table%20tennis\"&gt;table tennis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sport%20of%20athletics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"handball\"&gt;handball&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in 2010.\nThe school arranges overseas rugby tours to South Africa, Canada, USA, New Zealand and Hong Kong. The school also produced a British Pentathlon Champion in 2011.\nDrama and music.\nThe school GCSE and A Level groups have staged productions such as \"&lt;a href=\"Grease%20%28musical%29\"&gt;Grease&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Resistible%20Rise%20of%20Arturo%20Ui\"&gt;The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"West%20Side%20Story%20%28musical%29\"&gt;West Side Story&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Royal%20Hunt%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Animal%20Farm\"&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Madness%20of%20King%20George\"&gt;The Madness of King George&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Grimm%20Tales%20%28play%29\"&gt;Grimm Tales&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crucible\"&gt;The Crucible&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Little%20Shop%20of%20Horrors\"&gt;The Little Shop of Horrors&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Threepenny%20Opera\"&gt;The Threepenny Opera&lt;/a&gt;\". New productions have been staged, including some written by student and teachers such as \"The Letter of Marque\" (pronounced \"Mark\"), directed by Carrie Lee-Grey (SMOOSH) and written by Ashley Tomlin (Old Gravesendian and former Head of Middle School). There are a number of musical organisations at the school, including guitar and recorder clubs, a chamber orchestra and a choir.\nTrips.\nRecent years have witnessed educational visits to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, including various exchanges, as well as other trips to places such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Globe%20Theatre\"&gt;The Globe Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, Chessington World of Adventures, the Phoenix Theatre, Port Lymph Animal Park and &lt;a href=\"The%20British%20Museum\"&gt;The British Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Senior students have visited &lt;a href=\"Bolivia\"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mongolia\"&gt;Mongolia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zambia\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Botswana\"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Challenge%20Expeditions\"&gt;World Challenge Expeditions&lt;/a&gt;. Senior school members were stranded in Iceland with staff due to the &lt;a href=\"2010%20eruptions%20of%20Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull\"&gt;2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull&lt;/a&gt; for a period of six days during a Geography trip. Ski trips take place to &lt;a href=\"the%20Alps\"&gt;the Alps&lt;/a&gt;, Italy and Canada. The school has also taken pupils to canoe down the &lt;a href=\"Ard%C3%A8che%20%28river%29\"&gt;Ard\u00e8che&lt;/a&gt; and to scuba dive in &lt;a href=\"Gozo\"&gt;Gozo&lt;/a&gt;.\nMotto and school song.\nThe school &lt;a href=\"motto\"&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt;, \"Consule Cunctis\", was adopted in 1925 and whilst originally understood to mean \"Do thou take thought for the good of all men\", it is now translated as \"take thought for everyone\". Originally, the school song was \"Forty Years On\", the school song for Harrow School, but in 1926 two friends of the Headmaster wrote a new song, also called \"Consule Cunctis\". \"Forty Years On\" continued to be sung along with the new song at important dates in the school calendar, such as Speech Day, until the late-1940s. To reflect the ever-increasing numbers and diversity of the school, and particularly the inclusion of female students within the sixth form, the words have changed, in theory at least, from \"four hundred fellows\" to \"one thousand students\".\nSchool song.\nMany boys, erroneously, still sing the original School Song, which refers to \"\"Fellows\" as opposed to \"Students\"\"."
