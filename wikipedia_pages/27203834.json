In the period 2005\u20132009 the championships were part of the &lt;a href=\"UCI%20Juniors%20World%20Championships\"&gt;UCI Juniors World Championships&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrent events include: &lt;a href=\"track%20time%20trial\"&gt;time trial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"keirin\"&gt;keirin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"individual%20pursuit\"&gt;individual pursuit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"team%20pursuit\"&gt;team pursuit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"points%20race\"&gt;points race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"scratch%20race\"&gt;scratch race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sprint%20%28cycling%29\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"team%20sprint\"&gt;team sprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"omnium\"&gt;omnium&lt;/a&gt; and, for men only, &lt;a href=\"madison%20%28cycling%29\"&gt;madison&lt;/a&gt;. Women's events are shorter than men's. Championships are open to riders selected by their national cycling association. They compete in the colours of their country.\nThe UCI awards a gold medal and a &lt;a href=\"rainbow%20jersey\"&gt;rainbow jersey&lt;/a&gt; to the winner and silver and bronze medals to the second and third. World champions wear their rainbow jersey until the following year's championship, but they may wear it only in the type of event in which they won it. Former champions can wear rainbow cuffs to their everyday jerseys. World track championships are allocated to different countries each year. They are run by that country's national cycling association, although the judges are provided by the UCI.\nSummary.\nSource:\n2005 to 2009 as part of &lt;a href=\"UCI%20Juniors%20World%20Championships\"&gt;UCI Juniors World Championships&lt;/a&gt;."
