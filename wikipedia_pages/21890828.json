    "text": "The Macestus Bridge or Bridge of Sultan\u00e7ay\u0131r was a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20bridge\"&gt;Roman bridge&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Macestus%20River\"&gt;Macestus River&lt;/a&gt; ( or \"Susurluk \u00c7ay\u0131\") at &lt;a href=\"Bal%C4%B1kesir\"&gt;Bal\u0131kesir&lt;/a&gt;, in the northwestern part of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. Its flattened &lt;a href=\"arch\"&gt;arch&lt;/a&gt;es, slender &lt;a href=\"pier\"&gt;pier&lt;/a&gt;s and the hollow chamber system documented the progress made in &lt;a href=\"late%20antique\"&gt;late antique&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bridge%20building\"&gt;bridge building&lt;/a&gt;. A first cursory investigation of the 234\u00a0m long structure was conducted in the early 20th century, but since then its existence has been largely neglected by scholars. Current photos from 2009 show that the bridge has collapsed in the meantime.\nExploration.\nThe bridge is located at &lt;a href=\"Sultan%C3%A7ay%C4%B1r\"&gt;Sultan\u00e7ay\u0131r&lt;/a&gt;, in the heart of the ancient region of &lt;a href=\"Mysia\"&gt;Mysia&lt;/a&gt;, where it carried the road connecting Hadrianu Therai (\"&lt;a href=\"Bal%C4%B1kesir\"&gt;Bal\u0131kesir&lt;/a&gt;\") with &lt;a href=\"Miletopolis\"&gt;Miletopolis&lt;/a&gt; across the Macestus. During an exploration tour in 1902, the &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; archaeologist &lt;a href=\"Theodor%20Wiegand\"&gt;Theodor Wiegand&lt;/a&gt; found the ancient structure still in an excellent state of preservation; only the fourth pier from the eastern bank had been blown up some thirty years before in what was a crude and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to render the river navigable for larger vessels. Another brief account was given by his &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; colleague &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20William%20Hasluck\"&gt;Frederick William Hasluck&lt;/a&gt;, who also visited Mysia at the time.\nConstruction.\nThe Macestus Bridge has a width of 6.35\u00a0m and a length of 234\u00a0m, excluding the ramps at both ends. The distance between the centreline of the piers measures 17.80\u00a0m for each of its 13 arches, the clear span being 14.20\u00a0m and the pier width, accordingly, 3.60\u00a0m. The slender piers are protected upstream by triangular cutwaters and, owing to a favourable thickness against span ratio of almost 1 to 4, allowed the waterflow to pass the bridge relatively unrestricted. The rise from the springing line to the &lt;a href=\"Keystone%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;keystone&lt;/a&gt; is only 4.30\u00a0m (see drawing), giving the arcade a span-to-rise ratio of 3.3 to 1. The bridge is thus one of more than a dozen &lt;a href=\"Classical%20antiquity\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; segmental arch bridges known today.\nInside, hollow chambers were cut out to save material and reduce the weight resting on the &lt;a href=\"vault%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;arch vaults&lt;/a&gt;; these spaces are 4.40\u00a0m in width, 2.05\u00a0m in length, and are all arranged obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the bridge. Similar hollow chamber constructions are known to exist in other late &lt;a href=\"Roman%20bridge\"&gt;Roman bridge&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Asia%20Minor\"&gt;Asia Minor&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Aesepus%20Bridge\"&gt;Aesepus Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, whose small, slit-like recesses point in the direction of the roadway though.\nOn the exterior, a pair of arched niches was set into the &lt;a href=\"spandrel\"&gt;spandrel&lt;/a&gt; wall, with an additional, twice as large niche at the downstream side in between. These half-open spandrels were meant to further relieve the dead load on the bridge. The retaining walls, just as the breakwaters, were built with carefully hewn &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; blocks.\nThe outer &lt;a href=\"voussoir\"&gt;voussoir&lt;/a&gt;s of the arch rib are built of alternating bricks and &lt;a href=\"ashlar\"&gt;ashlar&lt;/a&gt; stones, while the rest of the arch vaults consists entirely out of bricks. Further materials mentioned by Wiegand include marble \u2013 probably for facing \u2013 and &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20%28masonry%29\"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt;, which could have been used as a binder, or may refer to &lt;a href=\"Opus%20caementicium\"&gt;Roman concrete&lt;/a&gt; which often served to fill the interior of the spandrels and the piers. Ancient &lt;a href=\"Spolia\"&gt;Spolia&lt;/a&gt; were reportedly not used.\nDate.\nThe use of flattened arches composed of brick and stone indicates, according to Wiegand, a construction date in the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Antiquity\"&gt;late Roman&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;early Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; period. Hasluck points out architectural parallels with the neighbouring &lt;a href=\"White%20Bridge%20%28Mysia%29\"&gt;White Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aesepus%20Bridge\"&gt;Aesepus Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, and dates the Macestus Bridge on that basis to the reign of &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Constantine the Great&lt;/a&gt; (\u2020 337\u00a0AD). The existence of a late Byzantine fortress, located on a hilltop some 300\u00a0m from the bridge, is taken as evidence for a continued use until at least the early 14th century. The present state of the structure is unknown, it is not listed in O'Connor's recent compilation of Roman bridges."
