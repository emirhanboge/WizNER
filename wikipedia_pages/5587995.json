The term is synonymous with and . The term most often refers to the guild names of &lt;a href=\"kabuki\"&gt;kabuki&lt;/a&gt; actors, but is also applicable to the names artists take from their masters or studios, names taken from one's business, and a few other similar circumstances.\nThe of , also often seen at the end of a name, means \"house\", \"roof\", or \"shop\", and helps to illuminate the origins and meanings of the term. A number of have associated emblems, some of which incorporate &lt;a href=\"rebus\"&gt;rebus&lt;/a&gt;es; see &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20rebus%20monogram\"&gt;Japanese rebus monogram&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOriginally, were place names of homes or buildings taken on by the inhabitants. Even when the house changed hands entirely from one family to another, the new family would take on the name of the house. However, the previous owners would frequently keep the house name when they moved. Often, a family (or individual) would come to be better known by their than by their actual family name.\nThough it is not clear when the custom first emerged, it first appears in print in the chronicles of the &lt;a href=\"Muromachi%20period\"&gt;Muromachi period&lt;/a&gt;. For many centuries, commoners in Japan did not have &lt;a href=\"family%20name\"&gt;family name&lt;/a&gt;s, and so would often come about to describe people by their location, occupation, or by a store or business they owned.

The famous actor &lt;a href=\"Ichikawa%20Danj%C5%ABr%C5%8D%20V\"&gt;Ichikawa Danj\u016br\u014d V&lt;/a&gt;, though he was from the Ichikawa family, was also known by the of Naritaya (Narita house), which indicates his guild within the kabuki world. This therefore connects him to others of the Naritaya, and reflects his apprenticeship and study alongside certain other actors who might be from other families. Actors' were often chosen to recall earlier great actors, and it remains a common practice (called ) for audience members to shout out an actor's when he performed a line or pose particularly well-executed, especially a pose or line associated with the actor's namesake.\nArtists, writers and poets in Japan, like in other parts of the world, would often take on &lt;a href=\"pen%20name\"&gt;pen name&lt;/a&gt;s or pseudonyms. These were sometimes derived from the names of their mentors (particularly in painting studios), in which case they could be considered .

Some of these survive as surnames today."
