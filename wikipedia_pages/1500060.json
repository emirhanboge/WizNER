    "text": "With its , Hiva Oa is the second largest island in the &lt;a href=\"Marquesas%20Islands\"&gt;Marquesas Islands&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"French%20Polynesia\"&gt;French Polynesia&lt;/a&gt;, an overseas territory of &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Located at 9 45' south latitude and 139 W longitude, it is the largest island of the southern Marquesas group. Around 2,200 people reside on the island. A volcano, &lt;a href=\"Temetiu\"&gt;Temetiu&lt;/a&gt;, is Hiva Oa's highest point with .\nHistory.\nColonial period.\nThe first recorded sighting of Hiva Oa by the Europeans was by the Spanish expedition of &lt;a href=\"%C3%81lvaro%20de%20Menda%C3%B1a%20de%20Neira\"&gt;\u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt; on 21 July 1595. They charted it as \"Dominica\".\nOverview.\nAdministratively, Hiva Oa is part of the &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20France\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; (municipality) of &lt;a href=\"Hiva-Oa\"&gt;Hiva-Oa&lt;/a&gt;, itself in the &lt;a href=\"French%20Polynesia%23Administrative%20divisions\"&gt;administrative subdivision&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Marquesas%20Islands\"&gt;Marquesas Islands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Atuona\"&gt;Atuona&lt;/a&gt;, on the coast of Hiva Oa island, is the administrative centre of the commune. Atuona was formerly the seat of government for all of the Marquesas Islands, but it has been replaced by &lt;a href=\"Taiohae\"&gt;Taiohae&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Nuku%20Hiva\"&gt;Nuku Hiva&lt;/a&gt; island.\nThe island is famous as the final home of &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; painter &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Gauguin\"&gt;Paul Gauguin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; singer &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Brel\"&gt;Jacques Brel&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom are buried in &lt;a href=\"Calvary%20Cemetery%2C%20Atuona\"&gt;Calvary Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking Atuona. It is also home to the largest &lt;a href=\"tiki\"&gt;tiki&lt;/a&gt; sculptures in French Polynesia.\nIn late pre-European times, the island was nearly evenly divided into two &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014&lt;a href=\"Nuku\"&gt;Nuku&lt;/a&gt; in the west, and Pepane in the east.\nGeography.\nHiva Oa is the largest and most fertile of the southern Marquesas islands and second only to &lt;a href=\"Nuku%20Hiva\"&gt;Nuku Hiva&lt;/a&gt; in size. Similar to all the larger Marquesas, Hiva Oa features steep cliffs abruptly rising from the ocean to a rugged interior spine of volcanic mountains, ridges, and deep, isolated valleys. Unlike most other Polynesian islands near the equator, no fringing &lt;a href=\"coral%20reef\"&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt;s protect Hiva Oa from the pounding of the ocean and only a few sheltered anchorages and sandy beaches are scattered around the coast. Travel along the shoreline is by boat as most of the coastal terrain is too rugged for roads. A few dirt roads traverse the interior and link seacoast villages and settlements. &lt;a href=\"Atuona%20Airport\"&gt;Atuona Airport&lt;/a&gt; is located at an elevation of on a plateau near the center of the island and has an asphalt-surfaced runway long with daily flights to other Marquesas islands and &lt;a href=\"Tahiti\"&gt;Tahiti&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe outstanding geologic characteristic of Hiva Oa is the collapsed &lt;a href=\"volcano\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Temetiu\"&gt;Temetiu&lt;/a&gt;. Semi-circular &lt;a href=\"Ta%27a%20Oa\"&gt;Ta'a Oa&lt;/a&gt; bay, also called the Bay of Traitors, is in the &lt;a href=\"Volcanic%20crater\"&gt;crater&lt;/a&gt; of the volcano whose walls rise sharply above the bay. Within Ta'a Oa are Atuona Bay and adjacent &lt;a href=\"Taha%20Uku\"&gt;Taha Uku&lt;/a&gt; which are the best anchorages on the island. Taha Uku has a protective seawall built in 1981.\nHiva Oa is separated from the nearby island of &lt;a href=\"Tahuata\"&gt;Tahuata&lt;/a&gt; to its south by a wide channel called &lt;a href=\"Ha%27ava\"&gt;Ha'ava&lt;/a&gt; or the Canal de Bordelais.\nClimate.\nTemperatures in the Marquesas are stable year around, but precipitation is highly variable. Precipitation is much greater on the north and east (windward) parts of the islands and much less on the western (leeward) parts. Droughts, sometimes lasting several years, are frequent and seem to be associated with the &lt;a href=\"El%20Ni%C3%B1o\"&gt;El Ni\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt; phenomena. The highest annual rainfall recorded in Atuona is ; the lowest is .\nGeology.\nThe island is of volcanic origin. Geologically, Hiva Oa belongs to the Marquesas Linear &lt;a href=\"Volcano\"&gt;Volcanic&lt;/a&gt; Chain, which formed from a &lt;a href=\"Hotspot%20%28geology%29\"&gt;hot spot&lt;/a&gt; on the Pacific Plate and is moving west-northwest at a rate of 103 to 118 mm. per year. The magmatic rocks on the island are between 1.63 and 4.26 million years old, but volcanic activity has not yet been completely extinguished. Not far from the road from Atuona to Taaoa, further west, some mud pots and small &lt;a href=\"Solfatara%20%28volcano%29\"&gt;solfataras&lt;/a&gt; can be seen.\nFlora.\nLike Nuku Hiva, Hiva Oa, as the second largest &lt;a href=\"island\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; in the archipelago, has a relatively high &lt;a href=\"biodiversity\"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt; for the South Pacific islands. A total of 205 native plants - 24 of them endemic - and 178 exotic species have been identified. Among the richest and most widespread native species on the island are ferns with a high number of endemic species. They cover large areas of the inaccessible, humid and shady incises of the &lt;a href=\"valley\"&gt;valley&lt;/a&gt;. Among the idiocorophytes (ancient autochthonous species) are probably the coconut palm and the screw tree, which are widespread in the lowlands.\nAnthropochorophytes, such as &lt;a href=\"Breadfruit\"&gt;breadfruit trees&lt;/a&gt; and Tahitian chestnut (Inocarpus edulis), already introduced by &lt;a href=\"Polynesia\"&gt;Polynesian&lt;/a&gt; settlers, predominate in the lowland and midland regions. A threat to native plant communities could be bamboo, which is not native to the island and has already formed extensive groves in some places.\nIn the higher, more inaccessible areas of the island, the natural &lt;a href=\"habitats\"&gt;habitats&lt;/a&gt; remain almost unchanged. The north, shaded by wind and rain from the mountains, is largely arid.\nFauna.\nThe &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt; of the Marquesas Islands is limited to land and sea birds, &lt;a href=\"Insect\"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt;, reptiles, &lt;a href=\"Butterfly\"&gt;butterflies&lt;/a&gt; and spiders. The Marquesas warbler (\"Acrocephalus mendanae mendanae\") is endemic to Hiva Oa and the neighboring island of &lt;a href=\"Tahuata\"&gt;Tahuata&lt;/a&gt;. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans. The nono fly, a type of black fly which occurs in the interior, is extremely unpleasant.\nPopulation.\nIn 2012, the population of Hiva Oa was 2,190, of which 1,845 lived in the commune of Acounda and 345 in the village of Puama'u. The inhabitants speak the southern &lt;a href=\"Marquesan%20language\"&gt;Marquesan language&lt;/a&gt;, related to other Polynesian languages, and &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe majority of the island's population professes &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the activity of both Catholic missionaries and various &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestant groups&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; controls 6 religious buildings on the &lt;a href=\"island\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt;, including the Church of the &lt;a href=\"Immaculate%20Conception\"&gt;Immaculate Conception&lt;/a&gt; (\"\u00c9glise de l'Immacul\u00e9e Conception\") in Atuona (the island's capital), the Church of Saint Anne (\"\u00c9glise de Sainte-Anne\") in Hanaiapa, the Church of &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%20of%20Lourdes\"&gt;Our Lady of Lourdes&lt;/a&gt; (\"\u00c9glise de Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes\") in Hanapaaoa, the Church of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Joseph\"&gt;Saint Joseph&lt;/a&gt; (\"\u00c9glise de Saint-Joseph\") in Nahoe, the Church of the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Heart\"&gt;Sacred Heart&lt;/a&gt; (\"\u00c9glise du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur\") in Puamau, and the Church of &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Heart\"&gt;Our Lady of the Sacred Heart&lt;/a&gt; (\"\u00c9glise de Notre-Dame du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur\") in Taaoaoa.\nAccording to the mythology of the ancient local religion, the &lt;a href=\"Deity\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; created the Marquesas as their &lt;a href=\"home\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, all the islands have names related to the construction of a house: Hiva Oa means long &lt;a href=\"ridge\"&gt;ridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomy.\n&lt;a href=\"Subsistence%20agriculture\"&gt;Subsistence agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, a combination of fishing, pig and chicken farming, and the cultivation of staple crops such as breadfruit, coconut, yam, taro, sweet potatoes and bananas, remains the basis of the island's economy. Part of the &lt;a href=\"copra\"&gt;copra&lt;/a&gt; is grown for export. Tourism has so far existed only to a small extent, but is economically important, as otherwise there are few jobs on the island. The currency is the &lt;a href=\"CFP%20franc\"&gt;CFP franc&lt;/a&gt;, which is pegged to the &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfrastructure.\nThe settlements are only partially connected by paved &lt;a href=\"Road\"&gt;roads&lt;/a&gt;. As the existing ones are also steep and winding, the preferred means of &lt;a href=\"transport\"&gt;transport&lt;/a&gt; between the villages is still by &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;. The west and the mountainous interior of the island are largely undeveloped.\nThe &lt;a href=\"airfield\"&gt;airfield&lt;/a&gt;, with a 1,250 m paved runway (&lt;a href=\"International%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization\"&gt;ICAO&lt;/a&gt; code: NTMN, &lt;a href=\"International%20Air%20Transport%20Association\"&gt;IATA&lt;/a&gt; code: HIX), is located on the Tepuna &lt;a href=\"plateau\"&gt;plateau&lt;/a&gt;, northeast of Atuona, and is connected to the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; by a winding road.\nAtuona has a fairly modern &lt;a href=\"infrastructure\"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"hospital\"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;, a medical and dental office, a &lt;a href=\"post%20office\"&gt;post office&lt;/a&gt; (with satellite phone), a &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; (with ATM), a national Gendarmerie station, a &lt;a href=\"courthouse\"&gt;courthouse&lt;/a&gt;, schools with preschool (\u00e9cole maternelle et primaire) and a &lt;a href=\"high%20school\"&gt;high school&lt;/a&gt; (Coll\u00e8ge Sainte Anne), as well as a &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestant church&lt;/a&gt;. For tourist needs, there is a hotel and small private pensions, as well as restaurants and bars.\nLarger &lt;a href=\"Cruise%20ship\"&gt;cruise ships&lt;/a&gt; can also enter Atuona Bay. However, they are usually anchored and passengers are disembarked. Regular supply ships to/from Tahiti dock at the harbor pier.\nTourism.\nPlaces of interest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; of Puamau is 45 km from Atuona (a two and a half hour drive up a steep and winding road). On the outskirts of the village is a large ceremonial platform, said to be the burial place of Queen Vahine Titoiani. There are large stone tikis carved on two corners of the platform.\nIn the Puamau valley, about two kilometers from the coast, is Ipona (formerly: Oipona), the largest and most important historical site in the Marquesas. The valley once belonged to the influential Naiki &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;, which also controlled the Atuona region. After the Naiki captured and consumed the chief of the neighboring tribe, Tio'o, the clans of the Hanapaaoa &lt;a href=\"district\"&gt;district&lt;/a&gt; took revenge and wiped out the Naiki. The victors erected a tapu on Ipona and installed tikis. After the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, this place of worship fell into disuse.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Marae\"&gt;Marae&lt;/a&gt; Takii, now well restored and consisting of three overlapping &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20%28earthworks%29\"&gt;terraces&lt;/a&gt;, stands at the foot of a steep cliff and includes 8 stone statues and cyclopean heads. The largest is Tiki Takai'i, the guardian spirit of the valley, at 2.43 meters. However, the most interesting artwork is the Maki'i Taua Pepe figure, unique in the entire South Seas region, which, according to Karl von den Steinen, physician and ethnologist, depicts a priestess or goddess giving birth. According to Thor Heyerdahl, who visited Hiva Oa in 1937, the &lt;a href=\"statue\"&gt;statue&lt;/a&gt; does not resemble a woman giving &lt;a href=\"birth\"&gt;birth&lt;/a&gt;, but \"more like an animal swimming,\" and he compared it to two sculptures of the \"alligator god\" from the St. Augustine culture. v.d. Steinen's interpretation of a &lt;a href=\"woman\"&gt;woman&lt;/a&gt; in labor is contradicted by the fact that the base emerged from the navel region and not from the loins. He learned from his informants that the statue had long been lying on its back in a thicket and had only \"recently\" been erected. Another notable site is in the Vustin River &lt;a href=\"valley\"&gt;valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso notable is the Taaoa Valley, west of Atuona, which is filled with huge &lt;a href=\"banyan\"&gt;banyan&lt;/a&gt; trees, coconut palms, twenty-meter tall &lt;a href=\"Barringtonia%20asiatica\"&gt;Barringtonia asiatica&lt;/a&gt;, many breadfruit trees, mango trees and Tahitian chestnuts. Among the dense &lt;a href=\"undergrowth\"&gt;undergrowth&lt;/a&gt;, it is difficult to distinguish most of the house and ceremonial platforms spread over an area of 3 ha, as little has been excavated and hardly anything has been restored. The Taaoa valley belonged to the sphere of influence of the powerful Tiu tribe, which plays a central role in the traditional &lt;a href=\"Myth\"&gt;myths&lt;/a&gt; of Hiva Oa. The buildings erected were correspondingly numerous and representative. In the center is a tohua, the largest of the Marquesas. A large tiki stands in the plaza and a stone head on one of the ceremonial platforms. Taro cultivation terraces have been found in the vicinity of the settlement. Ralph Linton explored this site as part of his expedition to the &lt;a href=\"Marquesas%20Islands\"&gt;Marquesas&lt;/a&gt;, 1920/21, organized by the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Museum\"&gt;Bishop Museum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Eiaone Valley, west of Puamau, is known for its unique and particularly expressive semi-relief petroglyphs. However, most of them are covered by dense vegetation. There are other petroglyphs, stone images and platforms in the Tahauku and Punae (Punai) valleys east of Atuona.\nThe Atuona cultural center dedicated to the painter &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Gauguin\"&gt;Paul Gauguin&lt;/a&gt; displays only copies of his paintings, but documents his life in the South Seas. His house, which was right next door, has been reconstructed. In the process a disused well was found where the later inhabitants had disposed of the painter's personal belongings, including a comb and &lt;a href=\"toothbrush\"&gt;toothbrush&lt;/a&gt;, jugs of wine, empty absinthe bottles, a morphine syringe, and tiger balm.\nThere are also some Jacques Brel memorabilia in &lt;a href=\"Atuona\"&gt;Atuona&lt;/a&gt;. In 2003 a hangar was built especially for his Beechcraft D 50 Twin-Bonanza under the name \"Jojo\", which has been restored in the meantime. Photos and documents from Brel's stay in the South Seas over several years are also on display here. A monument to Jacques Brel has been erected on a lookout point on the airport road.\nIn the Calvaire &lt;a href=\"Cemetery\"&gt;Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; (Cimeti\u00e8re Calvaire), located above Atuona, are the graves of Gauguin and Brel. It is sometimes doubted that this is Gauguin's actual grave; it is said that he was buried unmarked and somewhere in the jungle. The cemetery is a much-visited lookout point, offering views of Taaoa &lt;a href=\"Bay\"&gt;Bay&lt;/a&gt;."
