After working there for 2 years, Cedano quit the job and pursued other engineering jobs in the mining and chemical industries. In 1983, Cedano returned to &lt;a href=\"Don%20Julio\"&gt;Don Julio&lt;/a&gt; to work as an engineer, where he was subsequently promoted to Master Distiller and Distillery Manager of Tequila. During this time, Cedano was responsible for distilling and operations in the factory. In 1999, Cedano left the company after Seagrams purchased it. For next 11 years, he was involved in large-scale projects, which included building the first Agave Nectar factory and the first commercial Mezcal factory.\nTequila Tromba.\nIn 2010, Cedano founded his first independent brand, Tequila Tromba, in partnership with Canadian &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Brass\"&gt;Eric Brass&lt;/a&gt; and Australians Nick Reid and James Sherry.
