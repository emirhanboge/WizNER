It is home to a &lt;a href=\"Spring%20%28hydrosphere%29\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; at the base of the mountain, Arashiyama, that is believed to be blessed.\nIt is said that during the move of the capital from &lt;a href=\"Nara%2C%20Nara\"&gt;Nara&lt;/a&gt; to Kyoto, a noble saw a turtle bathing under the spring's waterfall and created a shrine there. It is one of the oldest shrines in the Kyoto area, its founding extending back to 700 CE. The restorative properties of the spring bring many local &lt;a href=\"sake\"&gt;sake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"miso\"&gt;miso&lt;/a&gt; companies to the shrine for prayers that their product will be blessed.\nThe shrine also serves a \"kinpaku miki\" (gold leaf filled blessed sake) during \"&lt;a href=\"hatsum%C5%8Dde\"&gt;hatsum\u014dde&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHistory.\nThe shrine became the object of Imperial patronage during the early &lt;a href=\"Heian%20period\"&gt;Heian period&lt;/a&gt;. In 965, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Murakami\"&gt;Emperor Murakami&lt;/a&gt; ordered that Imperial messengers were sent to report important events to the guardian \"&lt;a href=\"kami\"&gt;kami&lt;/a&gt;\" of Japan. These \"heihaku\" were initially presented to 16 shrines including the Matsunoo Shrine.\nFrom 1871 through 1946, Matsunoo-taisha was officially designated one of the , meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines."
