    "text": "The M:tel Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina (), also known as Liga 12, is the top tier &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;, and is operated by the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;. As the country's most prestigious level of football competition, the league changed format in the &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Premier%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;2016\u201317 season&lt;/a&gt; and is contested by 12 clubs with the last two teams relegated at the end of every season.\nThe League is, as of the 2021\u201322 season, represented by four clubs in European competition. The winner of the Premier League starts from the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; first qualifying round. The winner of the &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20Football%20Cup\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup&lt;/a&gt; as well as the runner up and third placed team on the table starts from the first qualifying round of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;. From the 2021\u201322 season, the runner up and third placed team on the table will start from the first qualifying round of the newly established &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa Conference League&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the season, the bottom two teams are relegated while winners of the &lt;a href=\"First%20League%20of%20the%20Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"First%20League%20of%20the%20Republika%20Srpska\"&gt;First League of the Republika Srpska&lt;/a&gt; are promoted to the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHistory.\nWar period 1992\u20131996.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"breakup%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;breakup of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, and following proclamation of independence in late winter 1992, &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; clubs left the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20First%20League\"&gt;Yugoslav First League&lt;/a&gt;, which ceased to exist after the 1991-92 season. Already in April the same year &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;N/FSBiH&lt;/a&gt; applied for membership with FIFA and UEFA. Meanwhile, due to the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"Bosnian%20War\"&gt;Bosnian War&lt;/a&gt; in April 1992 no games were played in the 1992\u201393 season. In late 1993 some parts of the country re-launched football competitions with reduced scope. But just as the country was divided along ethnic lines, so was football.\nIn 1993 &lt;a href=\"Croats%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnian Croats&lt;/a&gt; launched the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Federation%20of%20Herzeg%20Bosnia\"&gt;Football Federation of Herzeg Bosnia&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"First%20League%20of%20Herzeg-Bosnia\"&gt;First League of Herzeg-Bosnia&lt;/a&gt;, in which only Croatian clubs competed on parochial scale within the limits of &lt;a href=\"West%20Herzegovina\"&gt;West Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; and few other enclaves. In the same year &lt;a href=\"Serbs%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnian Serbs&lt;/a&gt; also organized their own &lt;a href=\"First%20League%20of%20the%20Republika%20Srpska\"&gt;First League of the Republika Srpska&lt;/a&gt;, on a territory held by Republika Srpska regime at the time.\nOnly football on a territory under the control of then &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; institutions and auspices of N/FSBiH, at the time consequently with &lt;a href=\"Bosniaks\"&gt;Bosniak&lt;/a&gt; majority, apart from a brief competition for the season &lt;a href=\"1994%E2%80%9395%20First%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;1994\u201395&lt;/a&gt; (won by &lt;a href=\"NK%20%C4%8Celik%20Zenica\"&gt;\u010celik Zenica&lt;/a&gt;), came to a standstill. \nCompetition under auspices of N/FSBiH did not resume until &lt;a href=\"1995%E2%80%9396%20First%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;1995\u201396&lt;/a&gt; season when the &lt;a href=\"First%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; was launched.\nPost-war period 1996\u20132000.\nThese three separate football leagues were operating in Bosnia and Herzegovina until 1998, and 2000. Since FIFA and UEFA showed support only for the association operating under patronage of the official and internationally recognized state institutions, during the war and prior to \"&lt;a href=\"Dayton%20Agreement\"&gt;Dayton Peace Agreement&lt;/a&gt;\" as well as after its signage, they endorsed unification of all three organizations as N/FSBiH. This also came as a consequence of FIFA decision to recognize N/FSBiH already in July 1996, while in the same year UEFA admitted N/FSBiH as an adjacent member until 1998 when they recognized its full membership. This meant that only N/FSBiH clubs and its &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;national team&lt;/a&gt; could compete at the international and official level.\nFinal unification has been preceded by several stages. At first was created a playoff where clubs were playing for the champion under N/FSBiH auspices. Idea was that playoff under unified N/FSBiH auspices should bring together clubs competing under three separate organizations for the first time but was rejected by Serb association, leaving clubs from Croat football association and N/FSBiH participating playoff for the seasons &lt;a href=\"1997%E2%80%9398%20First%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;1997\u201398&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1999%E2%80%932000%20First%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;1999\u201300&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20First%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;1998\u201399&lt;/a&gt; playoff was canceled due to Croat's association hesitation on the decision on which stadiums games should be played. Next season playoff was resumed for the last time prior to full and final agreement on unified N/FSBiH and its competition, Premier League BiH \"(Premijer Liga)\", in the fall 2000.\nPremier League creation 2000\u201301.\nFull and final agreement on unified N/FSBiH and its competition, Premier League BiH \"(Premijer Liga)\", happened in the fall 2000. However, the first &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20Premier%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;2000\u201301&lt;/a&gt; season seen clubs from &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Federation of BiH&lt;/a&gt; only, while clubs from Republic of Srpska entity continue to compete in their own separate league as their entity association still refused to join agreed unified N/FSBiH and its new competition. However, UEFA and FIFA never intended to recognize this separate organization nor its competition, which meant clubs could not compete outside territory of the entity and would not compete internationally. This situation forced clubs to insist that their organization also join N/FSBiH, and two years later they became part of the competition for the season &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Premier%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;2002\u201303&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since the year 2000 Premier League is the top tier of Bosnia and Herzegovina football, with two entity-based leagues, First League of Republika Srpska and First League of the Federation of BiH, being pushed to the second tier of the football pyramid and serve as feeder leagues to Premier League.\nPremier League as Liga 12 from 2016\u201317 until 2018\u201319.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%9317%20Premier%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;2016\u201317 season&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Premier%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;2017\u201318 season&lt;/a&gt; BH Telecom Premier League had changed its format entirely, reducing a number of clubs from 16 to 12, thus sometimes referred to as \"Liga 12\" (League 12), with the calendar also modified accordingly, and introducing &lt;a href=\"playoffs\"&gt;playoffs&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the \"title playoffs\") and play out.\nNumber of matches were played by each club during regular season after which, according to their position, they entered to play-offs or play out. Playoffs were contested by the top 6 clubs in the regular season, with each club playing each other twice for the title, which guarantees &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; qualifications, second and third place, guaranteeing &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt; qualifications berths. Play out was contested by six clubs to avoid relegation with last two teams being relegated.\nOld format since 2018\u201319.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Premier%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;2018\u201319 season&lt;/a&gt;, the league is not played as the last two seasons before. Actually very simple, after all the 12 clubs play each other two times, once home and once away, they play each other three times, also playing home or away depending on how the schedule is made. With that, the league season has 33 full rounds instead of the 22 rounds and an additional 10 rounds in the relegation and championship games.\nSponsorship.\nOn 31 July 2012, the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; signed a two-year deal with &lt;a href=\"BH%20Telecom\"&gt;BH Telecom&lt;/a&gt; regarding the sponsorship of the league, effectively renaming the league BH Telecom Premier League. The deal was extended once more before the start of 2014\u201315 season. On 24 July 2020, it was announced that &lt;a href=\"Mtel%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Mtel&lt;/a&gt; had become the new league sponsor for the next three years with an estimate 23 Million &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20convertible%20mark\"&gt;BAM&lt;/a&gt; worth, renaming the league m:tel Premier League.\nRankings.\nSource: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/index.html\"&gt;Bert Kassies' website&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//kassiesa.net/uefa/data/method5/crank2021.html\"&gt;country rankings&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/%23/yr/2021\"&gt;team rankings&lt;/a&gt;\nCountry.\n&lt;a href=\"UEFA%20coefficient%23Current%20ranking\"&gt;UEFA Country Ranking&lt;/a&gt; as of end-season of 2019\u201320 season.\nTeam.\nAs of 17 December 2020\n2020\u201321 season.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/%23/yr/2021\"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;\nBosnia and Herzegovina Champions.\nChampions of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nListing seasons (aside of 1998\u201399 season) before the creation of Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina where the champion was decided via a play-off played between best placed clubs who played in First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina and First League of Herzeg-Bosnia (without clubs from First League of the Republika Srpska).\nPremier League Champions.\nSince &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20Premier%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;2000\u201301 season&lt;/a&gt; the first tier of Bosnia and Herzegovina football competition became \"Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina\".\n1 Played without clubs from the Republika Srpska entity of BiH which have only taken part in the league since 2002.\nTimes finished in first three.\nCounting since when the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina is played and recognized by UEFA, season &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20Premier%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;2000\u201301&lt;/a&gt;\nCities.\nThe following table lists the champions by cities; Counting since when the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina is played and recognized by UEFA, season &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20Premier%20League%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;2000\u201301&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable performances in Europe.\nIn the qualifiers for the UEFA Champions League season &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2002\u201303&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FK%20%C5%BDeljezni%C4%8Dar%20Sarajevo\"&gt;\u017deljezni\u010dar&lt;/a&gt; gained the greatest success in Bosnian post-war club-football so far, going all the way to the last qualifying round for the most important club competition in Europe.
