    "text": "Marabou (historically spelled marabout) describes a certain type of &lt;a href=\"down%20feather\"&gt;down feather&lt;/a&gt; trimming. Although it takes its name from the &lt;a href=\"marabou%20stork\"&gt;marabou stork&lt;/a&gt; whose undertail down once provided the feathers, white &lt;a href=\"domesticated%20turkey\"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt; feathers have been used as a substitute. The advantage of marabou is that it takes dye well, making it a very versatile trimming for dress, and makes an effective substitute for fur. While marabou has been widely used as a fashion trimming since the late 19th century, it is also often used in &lt;a href=\"fly%20tying\"&gt;fly tying&lt;/a&gt; for making up the &lt;a href=\"artificial%20fly\"&gt;lures ('flies')&lt;/a&gt; used for &lt;a href=\"fly%20fishing\"&gt;fly fishing&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn fashion.\n\"Marabout\" was a very popular trimming from the late eighteenth century onwards. It was used for trimming hats and making up &lt;a href=\"muff%20%28handwarmer%29\"&gt;muffs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"feather%20boa\"&gt;feather boa&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Exhibition\"&gt;The Great Exhibition&lt;/a&gt; of 1851 prominently featured marabout alongside other feathers as second only in popularity to &lt;a href=\"ostrich\"&gt;ostrich&lt;/a&gt; feathers, and it was noted that white marabout was sometimes very scarce, and also that some manufacturers were making highly commended items from turkey and goose-down.\nSince the 20th century, marabou (spelt without a T) has become associated with lingerie and sex appeal. The &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Museum\"&gt;Metropolitan Museum&lt;/a&gt; states that 'no object better epitomizes the &lt;a href=\"sex%20kitten\"&gt;sex kitten&lt;/a&gt; glamour of the 1950s than the marabou &lt;a href=\"mule%20%28shoe%29\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;.' Marabou mules are popularly associated with glamorous 1950s actresses such as &lt;a href=\"Marilyn%20Monroe\"&gt;Marilyn Monroe&lt;/a&gt;, who wore them in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Year%20Itch\"&gt;The Seven Year Itch&lt;/a&gt;\"."
