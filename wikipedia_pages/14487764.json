However, the school is split between two sites, set well back from any main road, and this encourages vandalism which by March 2005 had cost thousands of pounds.\nThe school was mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"British%20House%20of%20Commons\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; in July 2006 when the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20Office\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20State\"&gt;Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Eagle\"&gt;Maria Eagle&lt;/a&gt;, in answer to a question from Gregory Campbell, stated that the main buildings were then 49 years old.\nAcademic standards.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Education%20%28Northern%20Ireland%29\"&gt;Education and Training Inspectorate&lt;/a&gt; carried out a follow-up inspection in February 2006 in which they stated that \"The school has some strengths in aspects of its educational and pastoral provision that can be built upon. The areas for improvement need to be addressed urgently if the school is to meet effectively, the needs of all the pupils.\"\nHowever, in a further follow-up inspection in January 2007 they found that the school had made a range of substantial improvements in the past year.\nSport.\nStudent Gordon Patton was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Northern Ireland under-18&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; squad in 2006-07."
