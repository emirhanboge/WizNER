    "text": "Solvency, in &lt;a href=\"finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt; or business, is the degree to which the &lt;a href=\"current%20asset\"&gt;current asset&lt;/a&gt;s of an individual or entity exceed the &lt;a href=\"Current%20liability\"&gt;current liabilities&lt;/a&gt; of that individual or entity. Solvency can also be described as the ability of a corporation to meet its long-term &lt;a href=\"Fixed%20cost\"&gt;fixed expenses&lt;/a&gt; and to accomplish long-term expansion and growth. This is best measured using the net liquid balance (NLB) formula. In this formula solvency is calculated by adding &lt;a href=\"cash%20and%20cash%20equivalents\"&gt;cash and cash equivalents&lt;/a&gt; to short-term investments, then subtracting &lt;a href=\"Promissory%20note\"&gt;notes payable&lt;/a&gt;.. There exist cryptographic schemes for both proofs of liabilities and assets, especially in the blockchain space."
