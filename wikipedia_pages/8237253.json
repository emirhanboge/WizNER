    "text": "Angel Wars is an &lt;a href=\"animated\"&gt;animated&lt;/a&gt; action adventure series from TeleStoryTOONS and &lt;a href=\"EMI%20CMG\"&gt;EMI CMG&lt;/a&gt; and more recently &lt;a href=\"Twentieth%20Century%20Fox\"&gt;Twentieth Century Fox&lt;/a&gt;. Since its introduction in late 2004, the series has presented Christian-based storylines through &lt;a href=\"3D%20animation\"&gt;3D animation&lt;/a&gt; provided by the LA based Backyard Digital Studios.\nOfficially called \"Angel Wars Guardian Force\", this &lt;a href=\"Computer-generated%20imagery\"&gt;CGI&lt;/a&gt; movie series is a basic underline of &lt;a href=\"Good%20and%20evil\"&gt;good versus evil&lt;/a&gt;. The movie is intended for viewers aged six and older. The protagonists are &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Biblical&lt;/a&gt; and fictional &lt;a href=\"angels\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe series is a departure from the traditional version of angels such as envisioned by &lt;a href=\"Gustave%20Dore\"&gt;Gustave Dore&lt;/a&gt;; the almost &lt;a href=\"mech\"&gt;mech&lt;/a&gt;-armoured angels in this series are more futuristic, with fantastical &lt;a href=\"chariot\"&gt;chariot&lt;/a&gt; vehicles and glowing weaponry.\nThe Guardian Force, headed by the biblical &lt;a href=\"Michael%20%28archangel%29\"&gt;archangel Michael&lt;/a&gt;, are briefed by the unseen &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;Maker&lt;/a&gt;, aboard an &lt;a href=\"airship\"&gt;airship&lt;/a&gt; called The Seven. They depart by spreading their wings and flying down to &lt;a href=\"Earth\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; where they battle demonic fallen angels that seek to corrupt humanity. The student angels (Anawim) use wingboards until they earn their wings. The angels and demons (Morg) are invisible to the human eye as they exist on a spiritual plane, unless they take human form. However, the angels can affect the physical world in order to miraculously save humans from danger."
