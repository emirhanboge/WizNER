    "text": "Puy de D\u00f4me (, ; or \"Pu\u00e8i de Doma\" ) is a &lt;a href=\"lava%20dome\"&gt;lava dome&lt;/a&gt; and one of the youngest &lt;a href=\"volcano\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt;es in the &lt;a href=\"Cha%C3%AEne%20des%20Puys\"&gt;Cha\u00eene des Puys&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Massif%20Central\"&gt;Massif Central&lt;/a&gt; in central &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. This chain of volcanoes including numerous &lt;a href=\"cinder%20cone\"&gt;cinder cone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lava%20dome\"&gt;lava dome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"maar\"&gt;maar&lt;/a&gt;s is far from the edge of any &lt;a href=\"tectonic%20plate\"&gt;tectonic plate&lt;/a&gt;. Puy de D\u00f4me was created by a &lt;a href=\"Pel%C3%A9an%20eruption\"&gt;Pel\u00e9an eruption&lt;/a&gt;, some 10,700 years ago. Puy de D\u00f4me is approximately from &lt;a href=\"Clermont-Ferrand\"&gt;Clermont-Ferrand&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Puy-de-D%C3%B4me\"&gt;Puy-de-D\u00f4me&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;d\u00e9partement&lt;/a&gt;\" is named after the volcano.\nHistory.\nIn pre-Christian &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, Puy de D\u00f4me served as an assembly place for spiritual ceremonies. Temples were built at the summit, including a &lt;a href=\"Gallo-Roman\"&gt;Gallo-Roman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Mercury%20%28Puy%20de%20D%C3%B4me%29\"&gt;temple of Mercury&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins of which were discovered in 1873.\nIn 1648, &lt;a href=\"Florin%20P%C3%A9rier\"&gt;Florin P\u00e9rier&lt;/a&gt;, at the urging of &lt;a href=\"Blaise%20Pascal\"&gt;Blaise Pascal&lt;/a&gt;, supported &lt;a href=\"Evangelista%20Torricelli\"&gt;Evangelista Torricelli&lt;/a&gt;'s theory that &lt;a href=\"barometer\"&gt;barometric&lt;/a&gt; observations were caused by the weight of air by measuring the height of a column of &lt;a href=\"Mercury%20%28element%29\"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt; at three elevations on Puy de D\u00f4me.\nIn 1875, a physics laboratory was built at the summit. Since 1956, a TDF (\"&lt;a href=\"T%C3%A9l%C3%A9diffusion%20de%20France\"&gt;T\u00e9l\u00e9diffusion de France&lt;/a&gt;\") antenna is also located there. On the top of the mountain, there is a transmitter for FM and TV.\nTourism.\nThe Puy de D\u00f4me is one of the most visited sites in the &lt;a href=\"Auvergne%20%28r%C3%A9gion%29\"&gt;Auvergne&lt;/a&gt; region, attracting nearly 500,000 visitors a year. The summit offers expansive views of the &lt;a href=\"Cha%C3%AEne%20des%20Puys\"&gt;Cha\u00eene des Puys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clermont-Ferrand\"&gt;Clermont-Ferrand&lt;/a&gt;. It is a well-known centre for &lt;a href=\"paragliding\"&gt;paragliding&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe summit can be reached by two &lt;a href=\"Trail\"&gt;pedestrian paths&lt;/a&gt;: a southern one (\"'\", formerly a &lt;a href=\"Roman%20road\"&gt;Roman road&lt;/a&gt;) and a northern one (\"\"Le sentier des ch\u00e8vres\")\" which runs past the ' crater. The &lt;a href=\"GR%20footpath\"&gt;GR 4&lt;/a&gt; long-distance trail includes both paths to cross the mountain.\nSince May 2012, visitors can also go up the mountain by train with the &lt;a href=\"Panoramique%20des%20D%C3%B4mes\"&gt;Panoramique des D\u00f4mes&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"rack%20railway\"&gt;rack railway&lt;/a&gt;.\nA road exists along the train tracks but it is closed to the general traffic, except for the military, service vehicles or emergencies.\nAt the top of the mountain, restaurants and shops are available as well as a &lt;a href=\"visitor%20centre\"&gt;visitor centre&lt;/a&gt; giving information on the history and geology of the area.\nSport.\nCycling.\nIn more recent times, Puy de D\u00f4me has served as an occasional stage finish in the &lt;a href=\"Tour%20de%20France\"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that in &lt;a href=\"1964%20Tour%20de%20France\"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20Poulidor\"&gt;Raymond Poulidor&lt;/a&gt; battled with &lt;a href=\"Jacques%20Anquetil\"&gt;Jacques Anquetil&lt;/a&gt; in one of the race's most famous moments, racing side by side up almost the entire climb; and that in &lt;a href=\"1975%20Tour%20de%20France\"&gt;1975&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eddy%20Merckx\"&gt;Eddy Merckx&lt;/a&gt; was punched in the kidney by a spectator. According to &lt;a href=\"Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pescheux\"&gt;Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pescheux&lt;/a&gt;, since the construction of a &lt;a href=\"Rack%20railway%20of%20Puy%20de%20D%C3%B4me\"&gt;rack railway&lt;/a&gt;, and because of the very narrow road, the Tour will never come back to the Puy de D\u00f4me, its last ascent in the race being in &lt;a href=\"1988%20Tour%20de%20France\"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Tour%20de%20France\"&gt;2020 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;, the first part of the ascent is covered via the &lt;a href=\"Col%20de%20Ceyssat\"&gt;Col de Ceyssat&lt;/a&gt;, during the 13th stage starting in &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2tel-Guyon\"&gt;Ch\u00e2tel-Guyon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe road is open to cyclists only during very limited periods (when other vehicles are prohibited). In 2006 this was 7\u20139am on Wednesdays and Sundays between 1 May and 30 September. In 2017, it was the first checkpoint in the &lt;a href=\"Transcontinental%20Race\"&gt;Transcontinental Race&lt;/a&gt;, a nonstop, unsupported bicycle race across Europe.\nMotorsports.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Circuit%20de%20Charade\"&gt;Circuit de Charade&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"motorsport\"&gt;motorsport&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"street%20circuit\"&gt;street circuit&lt;/a&gt; built in 1957 using pre-existing roads around the base of the Puy de D\u00f4me. The venue hosted the &lt;a href=\"French%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;French Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"French%20motorcycle%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;French motorcycle Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; several times in the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1986, the track was shortened due to safety issues and was converted into a dedicated motorsport &lt;a href=\"race%20track\"&gt;race track&lt;/a&gt; hosting &lt;a href=\"track%20day\"&gt;track day&lt;/a&gt;s, driving schools as well as &lt;a href=\"historic%20motorsport\"&gt;historic motorsport&lt;/a&gt; events.\nClimate.\nWhile the lower areas of the mountain are firmly &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20climate\"&gt;oceanic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; \"Cfb\"), Puy de D\u00f4me has a &lt;a href=\"humid%20continental%20climate\"&gt;humid continental&lt;/a&gt; (K\u00f6ppen: \"Dfb\") with borderline &lt;a href=\"subalpine%20climate\"&gt;subalpine&lt;/a&gt; characteristics, thanks to its high elevation. Its classification is determined from its January average being well below the -3\u00b0C threshold (with -5\u00b0C as its usual lows), and for having over 4 months of average temperatures that exceed 10\u00b0C (the requirement for this climate category is to have at least 3 months)."
