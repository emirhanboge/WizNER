    "text": "Montgomery is a &lt;a href=\"Administrative%20divisions%20of%20New%20York%23Town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orange%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The population was 22,606 at the 2010 census. It was named in honor of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Montgomery\"&gt;Richard Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt; general killed in 1775 at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Quebec%20%281775%29\"&gt;Battle of Quebec&lt;/a&gt;. The northern town line is contiguous with the &lt;a href=\"Ulster%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Ulster County&lt;/a&gt; border. Montgomery is immediately west of the town of &lt;a href=\"Newburgh%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Newburgh&lt;/a&gt;. Within its borders are three villages, one &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;eponymous&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Walden%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Walden&lt;/a&gt; and most of &lt;a href=\"Maybrook%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Maybrook&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe early town began as a patent to Henry Wileman in 1710, who was the first settler. He was the first of a group of &lt;a href=\"German%20Palatines\"&gt;Palatine Germans&lt;/a&gt; to emigrate and settle land around what is now the village of Montgomery.\nThe town was originally established as Hanover in 1772, but became the town of Montgomery in 1782.\nThe community of Montgomery was set off by &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20corporation\"&gt;incorporation&lt;/a&gt; as a village in 1810, and in 1855, the community of Walden was incorporated as well. Maybrook was the last village to be incorporated, in 1926.\nGeography.\nMontgomery is bordered on the east by the town of &lt;a href=\"Newburgh%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Newburgh&lt;/a&gt; and on the north by the town of &lt;a href=\"Shawangunk%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Shawangunk&lt;/a&gt; in Ulster County. The town of &lt;a href=\"Crawford%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Crawford&lt;/a&gt; is to the west. The towns of &lt;a href=\"Wallkill%2C%20Orange%20County%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Wallkill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamptonburgh%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Hamptonburgh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Windsor%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;New Windsor&lt;/a&gt;, from west to east, border on the south.\nThe village of Walden is located in the north central portion of town. Montgomery is close to the center, and Maybrook is in the southeast corner. There are few significant year-round settlements outside of the villages; there is a &lt;a href=\"summer%20colony\"&gt;summer colony&lt;/a&gt; around Lake Osiris in the northern section of town. Some inhabitants of Lake Osiris have made it their permanent residence. Fox Hill &lt;a href=\"Bruderhof%20Communities\"&gt;Bruderhof&lt;/a&gt; is located on the southern edge of Walden and has about 250 residents who work in their furniture factory and the &lt;a href=\"Plough%20Publishing%20House\"&gt;Plough Publishing House&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town's &lt;a href=\"topography\"&gt;topography&lt;/a&gt; is generally level and low, except along parts of its eastern and western boundaries, reflecting the passage of the &lt;a href=\"Wallkill%20River\"&gt;Wallkill River&lt;/a&gt; through it from north to west. There are large &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;s in the south portion of town, some of them draining into the &lt;a href=\"Otter%20Kill\"&gt;Otter Kill&lt;/a&gt;. Further north, the land becomes drier and more arable. It is mostly farmed, used for small residential &lt;a href=\"land%20subdivision\"&gt;subdivisions&lt;/a&gt; or left as undeveloped &lt;a href=\"Open%20space%20reserve\"&gt;open space&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few exceptions: the &lt;a href=\"business%20park\"&gt;business park&lt;/a&gt;s along Bracken, Neelytown and Stone Castle roads and &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Route%20208\"&gt;NY 208&lt;/a&gt;, several of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20Central%20School%20District\"&gt;Valley Central&lt;/a&gt; schools, the large &lt;a href=\"ShopRite%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Shop Rite&lt;/a&gt; plaza on Goodwill Road and &lt;a href=\"Orange%20County%20Airport%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;Orange County Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo areas along the river have been set aside as parks. The county's &lt;a href=\"Winding%20Hills%20Park\"&gt;Winding Hills Park&lt;/a&gt; is partially within Montgomery, as are portions of two larger state-level &lt;a href=\"protected%20area\"&gt;protected area&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Lakes%20State%20Park\"&gt;Highland Lakes State Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stewart%20State%20Forest\"&gt;Stewart State Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The Thomas Bull Memorial Park, which expands over 719 acres and is the second largest developed park in Orange County, is named after a sympathizer to the British during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolution\"&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wallkill%20River\"&gt;Wallkill River&lt;/a&gt; is the town's major watercourse, flowing through it from south to north past both the villages Montgomery and Walden, also partially serving as its border with Hamptonburgh. Two of its &lt;a href=\"tributary\"&gt;tributaries&lt;/a&gt; flow through Montgomery as well. The &lt;a href=\"Muddy%20Kill\"&gt;Muddy Kill&lt;/a&gt;, located entirely within the town, drains the area below the Comfort Hills in west central Montgomery. &lt;a href=\"Tin%20Brook\"&gt;Tin Brook&lt;/a&gt;, the Wallkill's only major eastern tributary, rises just southeast of the town and flows north, then west, through Walden to drain into the river just north of the village.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the town has a total area of 51.1\u00a0square miles (132.3\u00a0km2), of which, 50.4\u00a0square miles (130.6\u00a0km2) of it is land and 0.6\u00a0square miles (1.7\u00a0km2) of it (1.25%) is water. The highest point in the town is the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Geological%20Survey\"&gt;U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;'s Garrison &lt;a href=\"benchmark%20%28surveying%29\"&gt;benchmark&lt;/a&gt; at a corner of the Ulster County line on Kings Hill, at above sea level; this is also the highest point in the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Newburgh%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Town of Newburgh&lt;/a&gt; as well. The lowest elevation is , where the &lt;a href=\"Wallkill%20River\"&gt;Wallkill River&lt;/a&gt; flows across the northern town and county line.\nTransportation.\nMontgomery is referred to as the \"transportation hub of the northeast\" from the days prior to the 1940s. The &lt;a href=\"Erie%20Railroad\"&gt;Erie Railroad&lt;/a&gt; (later part of &lt;a href=\"Erie%20Lackawanna\"&gt;Erie Lackawanna&lt;/a&gt;) had the Goshen-Montgomery branch that went from Montgomery southward to &lt;a href=\"Hamptonburgh%2C_New_York%23Communities_and_locations_in_Hamptonburgh\"&gt;Campbell Hall&lt;/a&gt;, Campbell Hall Junction, to the Erie Railroad's &lt;a href=\"Main%20line%20%28railway%29\"&gt;main line&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Goshen%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Goshen&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Wallkill%20Valley%20Railroad\"&gt;Wallkill Valley Railroad&lt;/a&gt; (later absorbed into the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Central%20Railroad\"&gt;New York Central&lt;/a&gt;) ran north from Montgomery, to New Paltz, to Kingston, connecting there to the New York Central's &lt;a href=\"West%20Shore%20Railroad\"&gt;West Shore Railroad&lt;/a&gt;. Both railroads discontinued passenger operations on those lines by 1938. As of the late 20th century the rail lines have been reduced to freight spurs and &lt;a href=\"Walden%E2%80%93Wallkill%20Rail%20Trail\"&gt;rail trails&lt;/a&gt;, and roads have taken over that role.\nDemographics.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2000, there were 20,891 people, 7,273 households, and 5,447 families residing in the town. The &lt;a href=\"population%20density\"&gt;population density&lt;/a&gt; was 414.2 people per square mile (159.9/km2). There were 7,643 housing units at an average density of 151.5 per square mile (58.5/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 91.28% &lt;a href=\"white%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, 3.69% &lt;a href=\"African%20American%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28United%20States%20Census%29\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt;, .25% &lt;a href=\"Native%20American%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt;, .68% &lt;a href=\"Asian%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt;, .01% &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Islander%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Pacific Islander&lt;/a&gt;, 2.35% from &lt;a href=\"Race%20%28United%20States%20Census%29\"&gt;other races&lt;/a&gt;, and 1.73% from two or more races. &lt;a href=\"Hispanic%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Hispanic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Latino%20%28U.S.%20Census%29\"&gt;Latino&lt;/a&gt; of any race were 7.75% of the population.\nThere were 7,273 households, out of which 40.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 58.3% were &lt;a href=\"Marriage\"&gt;married couples&lt;/a&gt; living together, 11.6% had a female householder with no spouse present, and 25.1% were non-families. 20.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.84 and the average family size was 3.28.\nIn the town, the population was spread out, with 29.3% under the age of 18, 7.2% from 18 to 24, 31.1% from 25 to 44, 21.9% from 45 to 64, and 10.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.6 males.\nThe median income for a household in the town was $49,422, and the median income for a family was $56,376. Males had a median income of $40,881 versus $29,163 for females. The &lt;a href=\"per%20capita%20income\"&gt;per capita income&lt;/a&gt; for the town was $20,222. About 4.6% of families and 7.7% of the population were below the &lt;a href=\"poverty%20line\"&gt;poverty line&lt;/a&gt;, including 9.2% of those under age 18 and 10.3% of those age 65 or over.\nGovernment.\nAs in all New York towns, Montgomery is governed by a five-member town council, which in this case consists of the full-time &lt;a href=\"town%20supervisor\"&gt;town supervisor&lt;/a&gt;, in whom executive and financial power is vested, and four council members. The &lt;a href=\"town%20clerk\"&gt;town clerk&lt;/a&gt;, highway superintendent, and receiver of taxes are also elected. A ll officials serve four-year terms except the supervisor, who is elected every two years. Elections are held in odd-numbered years.\nRepresentation in the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Legislature\"&gt;state legislature&lt;/a&gt; is split between Republicans and Democrats in the town of Montgomery. It is at the southern end of the 101st &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Assembly\"&gt;Assembly&lt;/a&gt; district, currently represented by &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Miller%20%28New%20York%20politician%29\"&gt;Brian Miller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20State%20Senate\"&gt;State Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"James%20Skoufis\"&gt;James Skoufis&lt;/a&gt; represents the town as part of the 39th district.\nMontgomery residents live in &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;U.S. House&lt;/a&gt; districts held by &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of the state's &lt;a href=\"New%20York%27s%2018th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;18th congressional district&lt;/a&gt;, represented by &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Patrick%20Maloney\"&gt;Sean Patrick Maloney&lt;/a&gt;, and was previously one of three towns in the county to be part of what was then the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%27s%2022nd%20congressional%20district\"&gt;22nd district&lt;/a&gt;, represented by &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20Hinchey\"&gt;Maurice Hinchey&lt;/a&gt;.
