    "text": "Club Atl\u00e9tico Argentino de Quilmes, simply known as Argentino de Quilmes, is an &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club from &lt;a href=\"Quilmes%2C%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Quilmes, Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;. The team currently plays in &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;Primera B&lt;/a&gt;, the third division of the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;Argentine football league system&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded on 1 December 1899 by a group of students of &lt;a href=\"Colegio%20Nacional%20de%20Buenos%20Aires\"&gt;Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;, as a reaction against British hegemony in &lt;a href=\"Quilmes%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Club\"&gt;Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club&lt;/a&gt;, which did not permit Argentine natives to play.\nUnlike Quilmes AC, which honored visiting players with the traditional tea, the recently founded club Argentino de Quilmes offered \"&lt;a href=\"mate%20%28beverage%29\"&gt;mate&lt;/a&gt;\", a traditional infusion drink very popular in Argentina. That originated the nickname which Argentino would be known for.\nIn 1902 Argentino affiliated to &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Argentine Football Association&lt;/a&gt; and began participating in the domestic championships, making its debut in &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Primera Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1912%20in%20Argentine%20football\"&gt;1912&lt;/a&gt;. The team lasted there until 1918 when it was relegated to the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;second division&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1938 Argentino de Quilmes won the &lt;a href=\"Primera%20B%20Metropolitana\"&gt;Primera B&lt;/a&gt; title after defeating its main rival Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club, and therefore promoting to Primera Divisi\u00f3n. Nevertheless, during the &lt;a href=\"1939%20Argentine%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;1939 season&lt;/a&gt; Argentino made its worst campaign ever, obtaining only 4 points over 34 matches played and finishing in the last position. Argentino conceded 148 goals, scoring only 35, being relegated to the second division.\nAt the end of the 2005\u201306 season, Argentino was relegated to &lt;a href=\"Primera%20D\"&gt;Primera D&lt;/a&gt;, the fifth division of Argentine football."
