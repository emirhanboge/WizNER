    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Brother%20%28Christian%29\"&gt;Brother&lt;/a&gt; Marie-Victorin, &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20the%20Brothers%20of%20the%20Christian%20Schools\"&gt;F.S.C.&lt;/a&gt; (April 3, 1885 \u2013 July 15, 1944), was a &lt;a href=\"Canadians\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; member of &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20the%20Brothers%20of%20the%20Christian%20Schools\"&gt;Brothers of the Christian Schools&lt;/a&gt; and a noted &lt;a href=\"botanist\"&gt;botanist&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. He is known as the father of the &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20Botanical%20Garden\"&gt;Botanical Garden of Montreal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nHe was born Joseph-Louis-Conrad Kirouac to Cyrille Kirouac, a flower merchant, and Philom\u00e8ne Luneau in &lt;a href=\"Kingsey%20Falls%2C%20Quebec\"&gt;Kingsey Falls, Quebec&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to taking &lt;a href=\"religious%20vows\"&gt;religious vows&lt;/a&gt; and becoming Brother Marie-Victorin, he was known as Conrad.\nAlthough Brother Victorin is on record as having suggested that &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; build its own &lt;a href=\"botanical%20garden\"&gt;botanical garden&lt;/a&gt;s as early as 1919, the Garden was authorized by Montreal Mayor &lt;a href=\"Camillien%20Houde\"&gt;Camillien Houde&lt;/a&gt; only in 1929, with construction beginning in 1931.\nSubsequent administrations, both municipal and provincial, opposed the Garden as a &lt;a href=\"boondoggle\"&gt;boondoggle&lt;/a&gt;; however, Brother Victorin continued to champion its cause, promoting it at every opportunity, leading specimen-collection expeditions, recruiting &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Teuscher\"&gt;Henry Teuscher&lt;/a&gt; as its designer, and even (during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;) protecting it from being converted into a military flight school.\nBrother Victorin is also known for his writings: his \"Flore laurentienne\" is a botanical record of all species indigenous to southern Quebec, and was the first such record to be compiled. He also penned the preface to an historical biography of another fifth cousin, \"Zephirin Paquet. Sa famille, sa Vie, son Oeuvre. Essai de Monographie Familiale\", par fr\u00e8re Alcas.\nBrother Victorin died in Montreal in a car accident in July 1944 and he was entombed at the &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20des%20Neiges%20Cemetery\"&gt;Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal. A building at the &lt;a href=\"Universit%C3%A9%20de%20Montr%C3%A9al\"&gt;Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al&lt;/a&gt;, where he had taught botany, was subsequently named for him.\nLegacy.\nThe Marie-Victorin rose, developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, was named in his honour.\nTo honor the centennial of his birth in 1985, a park was established in his hometown of Kingsey Falls, named Parc Marie-Victorin. Originally 3 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s, it has expanded to nearly 30 acres, and volunteers and a small permanent staff. The park has been a leading in the province for horticultural development in the &lt;a href=\"green%20movement\"&gt;green movement&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the early 1990s, a private high school in Montr\u00e9al was opened and named for him. The school is still open but its name has changed in 2006.\nBrother Victorin has been inducted as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Science%20and%20Engineering%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;\nHe is fictionalized as a central character in &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Forcier\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Forcier&lt;/a&gt;'s 2019 film \"&lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Flowers\"&gt;Forgotten Flowers&lt;/a&gt; (Les fleurs oubli\u00e9es)\", in which he is portrayed by &lt;a href=\"Yves%20Jacques\"&gt;Yves Jacques&lt;/a&gt;."
