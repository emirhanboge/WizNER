    "text": "HMS \"Hero\" was the second and final &lt;a href=\"Conqueror%20class%20battleship\"&gt;\"Conqueror\"-class&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;. She was an &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20warship\"&gt;ironclad&lt;/a&gt; who served in the Victorian &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Navy\"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Hero\" was \u2014 like her sister-ship \u2014 designed to be an improved version of with a &lt;a href=\"Naval%20ram\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt; as her main armament. It was assumed by the &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20Admiralty\"&gt;Board of Admiralty&lt;/a&gt; and within Naval Architecture circles that the supremacy of armour over artillery would allow such a ship to ram an enemy vessel without being seriously damaged by enemy gunfire. This assumption was never tested in action.\nThe ship carried two big guns in a &lt;a href=\"Gun%20turret\"&gt;turret&lt;/a&gt; placed on the &lt;a href=\"Forecastle\"&gt;foredeck&lt;/a&gt;. Gunfire over the &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; was found to cause serious blast damage to the deck and its structures, while firing abaft the &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; caused blast damage to the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; and superstructure. The guns were limited to a firing arc of some 45\u00b0 on either side; as they had been installed with the intention of engaging an enemy on the beam who had evaded a ramming attack, this limit was not seen as serious.\nSix &lt;a href=\"Torpedo%20tube\"&gt;tube&lt;/a&gt;s for the launching of &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es were mounted; they were carried in the &lt;a href=\"aft\"&gt;aft&lt;/a&gt;er part of the superstructure and were intended to supplement the ram. The smaller guns were for defence against small craft, against whom the main armament could not be easily or economically employed.\nBy the time she was launched, ramming had been discarded, leaving her and her sister exposed as perhaps the two most useless turret-armed battleships ever built.\nService history.\nShe was commissioned at Portsmouth in May 1888 as tender to the gunnery school \"Excellent\". She remained there until February 1905, when she passed into Dockyard Reserve. She took part in the manoevres of 1888-1891, but saw no other active service. Commander Francis Alan Richard Bowles was appointed in command on 6 February 1900, and was succeeded by Commander George Bowes Hutton who was appointed in command on 6 March 1902.\nIn March 1900 she completed a series of &lt;a href=\"anchor\"&gt;anchor&lt;/a&gt; trials, where stockless anchors were tested successfully against anchors with stocks.\nIn November 1907, she was made a target ship and was sunk off the Kentish Knock on 18 February 1908.\nPopular culture.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Player%27s%20Navy%20Cut\"&gt;Player's Navy Cut&lt;/a&gt;\" cigarette packages used an illustration of a sailor with a warship in the background. The sailor's cap band reads \"Hero\"; this does not imply any connection with HMS \"Hero\", but just suggests that all Royal Navy sailors were heroes. (See the accompanying image.)"
