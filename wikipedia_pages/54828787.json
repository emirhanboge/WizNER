    "text": "Real Madrid Rugby was the &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid C.F.&lt;/a&gt;. Established in 1924, the team achieved 3 unofficial regional titles and 1 &lt;a href=\"Copa%20del%20Rey%20de%20Rugby\"&gt;Copa del Rey&lt;/a&gt; title in 1934, before being closed in 1948.\nAlthough the section is currently extinct, there were some attempts to re-introduce the practise of rugby, but they were not finally carried out, including an unsuccessful agreement with rugby club &lt;a href=\"CRC%20Madrid\"&gt;CRC Madrid&lt;/a&gt; to have a team representing them at &lt;a href=\"Divisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Honor%20de%20Rugby\"&gt;Divisi\u00f3n de Honor&lt;/a&gt;, the first division of Spanish rugby.\nHistory.\nThe rugby section of Real Madrid was established by some young members of the club, with former &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; Eulogio Aranguren among them. On 10 January 1925, the squad played its first match v. &lt;a href=\"Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20Rugby\"&gt;Atl\u00e9tico Madrid&lt;/a&gt; in the Stadium Metropolitano, which was won by Real Madrid by 27\u20130. During its first years of existence, Real Madrid Rugby played in different venues, such as Chamart\u00edn, El Estadio, El Campo de Los Suizos and Canillejas.\nOn 25 January 1925, Real Madrid played Infantry Academy of Toledo at &lt;a href=\"Estadio%20Chamart%C3%ADn\"&gt;Estadio Chamart\u00edn&lt;/a&gt;, with a new win for Real Madrid by 23\u20139. After the match, the team was also awarded its first trophy. \nAt regional level, Real Madrid Rugby won four consecutive Campeonato Regional Centro, during the first years of the 1930s.\nIn 1934 Real Madrid won its first national title, the &lt;a href=\"Copa%20del%20Rey%20de%20Rugby\"&gt;Copa del Rey de Rugby&lt;/a&gt;, after defeating Universitario de Valencia by 14\u20136. It would be its only title in that competition. Some of the most notable players of that final were &lt;a href=\"fly-half\"&gt;fly-half&lt;/a&gt; Carlos Garc\u00eda San Miguel and Ram\u00f3n Resines.\nAfter a hiatus due to &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; (1936\u201339), the rugby section of Real Madrid finally disappeared in 1948. In an attempt to bring the sport back to the club, in 2008 Real Madrid made arrangements with rugby club &lt;a href=\"CRC%20Madrid\"&gt;CRC Madrid&lt;/a&gt; (also known as CRC Pozuelo) to be represented in the Spanish premier league, &lt;a href=\"Divisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Honor%20de%20Rugby\"&gt;Divisi\u00f3n de Honor&lt;/a&gt;. When the agreement was about to be signed, president of Real Madrid &lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20Calder%C3%B3n\"&gt;Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, who had been the main architect of the return of rugby to the club, resigned from his role following allegations of vote-rigging for the confirmation for the financial budget. Real Madrid exploded into a crisis that suspended many projects and operations in the club, including the rugby section.\nWith the coming of &lt;a href=\"Florentino%20P%C3%A9rez\"&gt;Florentino P\u00e9rez&lt;/a&gt; to the club for a second term, past negotiations were not resumed. Therefore, rugby section has remained inactive since then.\nAfter that, &lt;a href=\"Atl%C3%A9tico%20de%20Madrid\"&gt;Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid&lt;/a&gt; made a deal with CRC Madrid to have a rugby team in the Divisi\u00f3n de Honor. The CRC squad agreed to use the name, shield and colors of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid during the time the agreement was in force."
