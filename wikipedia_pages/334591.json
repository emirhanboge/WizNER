    "text": "Jan Baptist van Helmont (; ; 12 January 1580\u00a0\u2013 30 December 1644) was a &lt;a href=\"chemist\"&gt;chemist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"physiologist\"&gt;physiologist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"physician\"&gt;physician&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. He worked during the years just after &lt;a href=\"Paracelsus\"&gt;Paracelsus&lt;/a&gt; and the rise of &lt;a href=\"iatrochemistry\"&gt;iatrochemistry&lt;/a&gt;, and is sometimes considered to be \"the founder of &lt;a href=\"pneumatic%20chemistry\"&gt;pneumatic chemistry&lt;/a&gt;\". Van Helmont is remembered today largely for his ideas on spontaneous generation, his 5-year willow tree experiment, and his introduction of the word \"&lt;a href=\"gas\"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt;\" (from the Greek word \"chaos\") into the vocabulary of science.\nHis name is also found rendered as Jan-Baptiste van Helmont, Johannes Baptista van Helmont, Johann Baptista von Helmont, Joan Baptista van Helmont, and other minor variants switching between \"von\" and \"van\".\nEarly life and education.\nJan Baptist van Helmont was the youngest of five children of Maria (van) Stassaert and Christiaen van Helmont, a public prosecutor and Brussels council member, who had married in the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Michael%20and%20Gudula%20Cathedral\"&gt;Sint-Goedele&lt;/a&gt; church in 1567. He was educated at &lt;a href=\"Old%20University%20of%20Leuven\"&gt;Leuven&lt;/a&gt;, and after ranging restlessly from one science to another and finding satisfaction in none, turned to medicine. He interrupted his studies, and for a few years he traveled through &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturning to his own country, van Helmont obtained a medical degree in 1599. He practiced at &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the great plague in 1605, after which he wrote a book titled \"De Peste\" (On Plague), which was reviewed by &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton\"&gt;Newton&lt;/a&gt; in 1667. In 1609 he finally obtained his doctoral degree in medicine. The same year he married Margaret van Ranst, who was of a wealthy noble family. Van Helmont and Margaret lived in &lt;a href=\"Vilvoorde\"&gt;Vilvoorde&lt;/a&gt;, near Brussels, and had six or seven children. The inheritance of his wife enabled him to retire early from his medical practice and occupy himself with chemical experiments until his death on 30 December 1644.\nCareer as chemistry pioneer.\nVan Helmont is regarded as the founder of &lt;a href=\"pneumatic%20chemistry\"&gt;pneumatic chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, as he was the first to understand that there are gases distinct in kind from atmospheric air and furthermore invented the word \"&lt;a href=\"gas\"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt;\". He perceived that his \"gas sylvestre\" (&lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;) given off by burning charcoal, was the same as that produced by &lt;a href=\"fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29\"&gt;fermenting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"must\"&gt;must&lt;/a&gt;, a gas which sometimes renders the air of caves unbreathable. For Van Helmont, &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; were the two primitive elements. Fire he explicitly denied to be an &lt;a href=\"classical%20element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;, and earth is not one because it can be reduced to water.\nOn the one hand, Van Helmont was a disciple of the mystic and &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paracelsus\"&gt;Paracelsus&lt;/a&gt;, though he scornfully repudiated the errors of most contemporary authorities, including Paracelsus. On the other hand, he engaged in the &lt;a href=\"new%20learning\"&gt;new learning&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href=\"experiment\"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;ation that was producing men like &lt;a href=\"William%20Harvey\"&gt;William Harvey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galileo%20Galilei\"&gt;Galileo Galilei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Francis%20Bacon\"&gt;Francis Bacon&lt;/a&gt;. Van Helmont was a careful observer of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;; his analysis of data gathered in his experiments suggests that he had a concept of the conservation of mass. He was an early experimenter in seeking to determine how plants gain mass. \nThe Willow tree experiment.\nHelmont's experiment on a willow tree has been considered among the earliest quantitative studies on plant nutrition and growth and as a milestone in the history of biology. The experiment was only published posthumously in \"Ortus Medicinae\" (1648) and may have been inspired by &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20of%20Cusa\"&gt;Nicholas of Cusa&lt;/a&gt; who wrote on the same idea in \"De staticis experimentis\" (1450). Helmont grew a willow tree and measured the amount of soil, the weight of the tree and the water he added. After five years the plant had gained about 164\u00a0lbs (74\u00a0kg). Since the amount of soil was nearly the same as it had been when he started his experiment (it lost only 57 grams), he deduced that the tree's weight gain had come entirely from water.\nReligious and philosophical opinions.\nAlthough a faithful Catholic, he incurred the suspicion of the Church by his tract \"De magnetica vulnerum curatione\" (1621), against &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Roberti\"&gt;Jean Roberti&lt;/a&gt;, which was thought to derogate from some of the miracles. His works were collected and edited by his son &lt;a href=\"Franciscus%20Mercurius%20van%20Helmont\"&gt;Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont&lt;/a&gt; and published by &lt;a href=\"Lodewijk%20Elzevir\"&gt;Lodewijk Elzevir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam\"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; as \"Ortus medicinae, vel opera et opuscula omnia\" (\"The Origin of Medicine, or Complete Works\") in 1648. \"Ortus medicinae\" was based on, but not restricted to, the material of \"Dageraad ofte Nieuwe Opkomst der Geneeskunst\" (\"Daybreak, or the New Rise of Medicine\"), which was published in 1644 in Van Helmont's native Dutch. His son Frans's writings, \"Cabbalah Denudata\" (1677) and \"Opuscula philosophica\" (1690) are a mixture of theosophy, mysticism and alchemy.\nOver and above the \"&lt;a href=\"archeus\"&gt;archeus&lt;/a&gt;\", he believed that there is the sensitive &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; which is the husk or shell of the immortal mind. Before &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Man\"&gt;the Fall&lt;/a&gt; the archeus obeyed the immortal mind and was directly controlled by it, but at the Fall men also received the sensitive soul and with it lost immortality, for when it perishes the immortal mind can no longer remain in the body.\nVan Helmont described the \"archeus\" as \"aura vitalis seminum, vitae directrix\" (\"The chief Workman [Archeus] consists of the conjoyning of the vitall air, as of the matter, with the seminal likeness, which is the more inward spiritual kernel, containing the fruitfulness of the Seed; but the visible Seed is onely the husk of this.\").\nIn addition to the archeus, van Helmont believed in other governing agencies resembling the archeus which were not always clearly distinguished from it. From these he invented the term \"blas\" (motion), defined as the \"vis motus tam alterivi quam localis\" (\"twofold motion, to wit, locall, and alterative\"), that is, natural motion and motion that can be altered or voluntary. Of\" blas\" there were several kinds, e.g. blas humanum (blas of humans), blas of stars and blas meteoron (blas of meteors); of meteors he said \"constare gas materi\u00e2 et blas efficiente\" (\"Meteors do consist of their matter Gas, and their efficient cause Blas, as well the Motive, as the altering\").\nVan Helmont \"had frequent visions throughout his life and laid great stress upon them\". His choice of a medical profession has been attributed to a conversation with the angel Raphael., and some of his writings described imagination as a celestial, and possibly magical, force. Though Van Helmont was skeptical of specific mystical theories and practices, he refused to discount magical forces as explanations for certain natural phenomena. This stance, reflected in a 1621 paper on sympathetic principles, may have contributed to his prosecution and subsequent house arrest.\nObservations on digestion.\nVan Helmont wrote extensively on the subject of digestion. In \"Oriatrike or Physick Refined\" (1662, an English translation of \"Ortus medicinae\"), van Helmont considered earlier ideas on the subject, such as food being digested through the body's internal heat. But if that were so, he asked, how could cold-blooded animals live? His own opinion was that digestion was aided by a chemical reagent, or \"ferment\", within the body, such as inside the stomach. Harr\u00e9 suggests that van Helmont's theory was \"very near to our modern concept of an enzyme\".\nVan Helmont proposed and described six different stages of digestion.\nDisputed portrait.\nIn 2003, the historian &lt;a href=\"Lisa%20Jardine\"&gt;Lisa Jardine&lt;/a&gt; proposed that a portrait held in the collections of the &lt;a href=\"Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London\"&gt;Natural History Museum, London&lt;/a&gt;, traditionally identified as &lt;a href=\"John%20Ray\"&gt;John Ray&lt;/a&gt;, might represent &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Hooke\"&gt;Robert Hooke&lt;/a&gt;. Jardine's hypothesis was subsequently disproved by &lt;a href=\"William%20B.%20Jensen\"&gt;William B. Jensen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cincinnati\"&gt;University of Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt; and by the German researcher Andreas Pechtl of &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Gutenberg%20University%20of%20Mainz\"&gt;Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz&lt;/a&gt;, who showed that the portrait in fact depicts van Helmont.\nHonours.\nIn 1875, he was honoured by Belgian botanist &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Cogniaux\"&gt;Alfred Cogniaux&lt;/a&gt; (1841\u20131916), who named a genus of flowering plants from South America, \"&lt;a href=\"Helmontia\"&gt;Helmontia&lt;/a&gt;\" (from the &lt;a href=\"Cucurbitaceae\"&gt;Cucurbitaceae&lt;/a&gt; family)."
