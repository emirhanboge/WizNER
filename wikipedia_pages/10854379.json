    "text": "The Economy of &lt;a href=\"Dubai\"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; represents a &lt;a href=\"gross%20domestic%20product\"&gt;gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt; as of 2018 of US$102.67\u00a0billion. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Recession\"&gt;Great Recession&lt;/a&gt; slowed the construction boom.\nThe International Herald Tribune has described it as \"planned free-market capitalism.\" Oil production, which once accounted for 50 percent of Dubai's gross domestic product, contributes less than 1 percent to GDP today. Dubai became important ports of call for Western &lt;a href=\"manufacture\"&gt;manufacture&lt;/a&gt;rs. Most of the new city's banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area. Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s. The city of Dubai has a &lt;a href=\"free%20trade\"&gt;free trade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and until the 1990s was the hub of a \"brisk &lt;a href=\"smuggling\"&gt;smuggling&lt;/a&gt; trade\" of gold &lt;a href=\"ingot\"&gt;ingot&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, where gold import was restricted.\nToday, Dubai has focused its economy on &lt;a href=\"Tourism%20in%20Dubai\"&gt;tourism&lt;/a&gt; by building hotels and developing real estate. Port &lt;a href=\"Jebel%20Ali\"&gt;Jebel Ali&lt;/a&gt;, constructed in the 1970s, has the largest man-made harbor in the world, but is also increasingly developing as a hub for service industries such as &lt;a href=\"Information%20technology\"&gt;IT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"finance\"&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt;, with the new &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20International%20Financial%20Centre\"&gt;Dubai International Financial Centre&lt;/a&gt; (DIFC). &lt;a href=\"Emirates%20Airline\"&gt;Emirates Airline&lt;/a&gt; was founded by the government in 1985 and is still state-owned; based at Dubai International Airport, it carried over 49.7 million passengers in 2015.\nAccording to Healy Consultants, Dubai is the top business gateway for the Middle East and Africa. The government has set up industry-specific &lt;a href=\"free%20economic%20zone\"&gt;free zones&lt;/a&gt; throughout the city in hopes of giving a boost to Dubai property. &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Internet%20City\"&gt;Dubai Internet City&lt;/a&gt;, now combined with &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Media%20City\"&gt;Dubai Media City&lt;/a&gt; as part of TECOM (Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority) is one such enclave whose members include IT firms such as &lt;a href=\"EMC%20Corporation\"&gt;EMC Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Corporation\"&gt;Oracle Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Software\"&gt;Sage Software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"IBM\"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;, and media organisations such as &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East%20Broadcasting%20Center\"&gt;MBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reuters\"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Knowledge%20Village\"&gt;Dubai Knowledge Village&lt;/a&gt; (KV), an education and training hub, is also set up to complement the Free Zone's other two clusters, &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Internet%20City\"&gt;Dubai Internet City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Media%20City\"&gt;Dubai Media City&lt;/a&gt;, by providing the facilities to train the clusters' future &lt;a href=\"knowledge%20worker\"&gt;knowledge worker&lt;/a&gt;s. Dubai Outsourcing Zone is for companies who are involved in outsourcing activities can set up their offices with concessions provided by Dubai Government. Internet access is restricted in most areas of Dubai with a &lt;a href=\"proxy%20server\"&gt;proxy server&lt;/a&gt; filtering out sites deemed to be against cultural and religious values of the &lt;a href=\"UAE\"&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the financial crisis of 2008-2009, Dubai was about to default and, therefore, was obliged to downsize and restructure suffering state entities. The &lt;a href=\"International%20Monetary%20Fund\"&gt;International Monetary Fund (IMF)&lt;/a&gt; stated in 2019 that Dubai\u2019s debt exceeded 100% of its GDP. Abu Dhabi rolled over a bailout loan of $20 billion to Dubai to save it.\nCorporations.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, &lt;a href=\"Dubai\"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; saw a 12.5% rise in the number of new registered companies as 9,317 new firms registered with the Dubai Trade, and this had brought the total number of registered companies in &lt;a href=\"Dubai\"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; to 106,000.\nBetween January and August 2017, Dubai issued licenses for 249,000 businesses, making up 46.8% of the total number of licenses issued across the &lt;a href=\"United%20Arab%20Emirates\"&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt; during that period.\nMain Economic Drivers.\nTravel and Tourism.\nTourism is a major economic source of income in Dubai and part of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Dubai\"&gt;Dubai government&lt;/a&gt;'s strategy to maintain the flow of foreign cash into the emirates. The tourism sector contributed in 2017 about $41 billion to the &lt;a href=\"Gross%20domestic%20product\"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt;, making up 4.6% of the GDP, and provided some 570,000 jobs, accounting for 48% of total employment. The contribution of the sector to the GDP rose by 138% during the years 2007-2017.\nThe Dubai International Airport (DXB) recorded 83.6 million passengers in 2016, and 14.9 million visitors stayed in Dubai hotels in the same year, a rise of 5% from 2015.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Israel%E2%80%93United%20Arab%20Emirates%20normalization%20agreement\"&gt;Abraham Accords peace agreement&lt;/a&gt; was signed on Sept. 15, 2020, over 50,000 Israelis visited the &lt;a href=\"United%20Arab%20Emirates\"&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt; as daily direct flights between &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aviv\"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; and Dubai were operated even during the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; as the two countries declared each other \u2018green zones,\u2019 sparing travellers the quarantine periods. On Dec. 26, 2020, an order signed by Israel's Health Ministry Director-General Chezy Levy went into effect, requiring all returnees from Dubai to enter a 14-day &lt;a href=\"quarantine\"&gt;quarantine&lt;/a&gt;.\nReal estate and property.\nThe government's decision to diversify from a trade-based but &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.arabianbusiness.com/politics-economics/412964-dubai-business-optimism-at-highest-since-2012-says-emirates-nbd\"&gt;oil-reliant economy&lt;/a&gt; to one that is service- and tourism-oriented resulted in the property boom from 2004 to 2008. Construction on a large scale has turned Dubai into one of the fastest-growing cities in the world.\nThe property boom is largely driven by &lt;a href=\"megaprojects\"&gt;megaprojects&lt;/a&gt; such as the off-shore &lt;a href=\"Palm%20Islands\"&gt;Palm Islands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20World%20%28archipelago%29\"&gt;The World&lt;/a&gt;, and the inland &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Marina\"&gt;Dubai Marina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burj%20Khalifa\"&gt;Burj Khalifa&lt;/a&gt; complex, &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Waterfront\"&gt;Dubai Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Business%20Bay\"&gt;Business Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dubailand\"&gt;Dubailand&lt;/a&gt; and Jumeirah Village.\nDubai is home to &lt;a href=\"skyscrapers\"&gt;skyscrapers&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Emirates%20Towers\"&gt;Emirates Towers&lt;/a&gt;, which are the 12th and 24th tallest buildings in the world, and the &lt;a href=\"Burj-al-Arab\"&gt;Burj-al-Arab&lt;/a&gt; hotel, located on its own artificial island and currently the world's fifth tallest and most expensive hotel.\n&lt;a href=\"Emaar\"&gt;Emaar&lt;/a&gt; Properties constructed the world's current tallest structure, the &lt;a href=\"Burj%20Khalifa\"&gt;Burj Khalifa&lt;/a&gt;. The height of the skyscraper is 828\u00a0m (2,717\u00a0ft) tall, with 160 floors. Adjacent to Burj Khalifa is the &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Mall\"&gt;Dubai Mall&lt;/a&gt;, which at the time of construction was the world's largest shopping mall.\nAlso under construction is what is planned to become Dubai's new &lt;a href=\"central%20business%20district\"&gt;central business district&lt;/a&gt;, named &lt;a href=\"Business%20Bay\"&gt;Business Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The project, when completed, will feature 500 skyscrapers built around an artificial extension of the existing Dubai Creek.\nIn February 2005, the construction of &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Waterfront\"&gt;Dubai Waterfront&lt;/a&gt; was announced, it will be 2\u00bd times the size of &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, roughly seven times the size of the island of &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;. Dubai Waterfront will be a mix of canals and islands full of hotels and residential areas that will add of man-made waterfront. It will also contain &lt;a href=\"Nakheel%20Tower\"&gt;Al Burj&lt;/a&gt;, another one of the tallest buildings in the world.\nDubai has also launched &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Science%20Park\"&gt;Dubai Science Park&lt;/a&gt; (previously DuBiotech and merged with EnPark). This is a new &lt;a href=\"business%20park\"&gt;business park&lt;/a&gt; to be targeted at &lt;a href=\"biotechnology\"&gt;biotechnology&lt;/a&gt; companies working in &lt;a href=\"Pharmaceutical%20company\"&gt;pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;, medical fields, &lt;a href=\"genetics\"&gt;genetic research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"biodefense\"&gt;biodefense&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of Dubai's plans in 2006 was for a 30-story, 200 apartment skyscraper that will slowly rotate at its base, making a 360-degree revolution once a week. The world's first rotating skyscraper was to be in the center of the Dubailand complex.\nThe &lt;a href=\"International%20Media%20Production%20Zone\"&gt;International Media Production Zone&lt;/a&gt; is a project targeted at creating a hub for printers, publishers, media production companies, and related industry segments. Launched in 2003, the project was scheduled to be completed in 2006.\nIn May 2006 the &lt;a href=\"Bawadi\"&gt;Bawadi&lt;/a&gt; was announced, with a planned 27 billion US-dollar investment intended to increase Dubai's number of hotel rooms by 29,000, doubling it from the current figure offers now. The largest complex was to be called \"Asia, Asia\" and was planned to be the largest hotel in the world with more than 6,500 rooms.\nThe first villa freehold properties that were occupied by non-UAE nationals were The Meadows, The Springs, and The Lakes (high-end neighborhoods designed by Emaar Properties, collectively called Emirates Hills).\nExpatriates of various nationalities brought capital into Dubai in the early 2000s. &lt;a href=\"Economy%20of%20Iran%23International%20trade\"&gt;Iranian expatriates&lt;/a&gt; were estimated to have invested up to $200 billion in Dubai. From 2005 to 2009, trade between Dubai and &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; tripled to $12 billion.\nDubai nationals have also purchased real estate in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. Purchases in 2005 included New York's 230 Park Avenue (formerly known as the New York Central Building or the &lt;a href=\"Helmsley%20Building\"&gt;Helmsley Building&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Jumeirah%20Essex%20House\"&gt;Essex House&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Central%20Park%20South\"&gt;Central Park South&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dubai property boom of the mid-2000s peaked in 2008 and plummeted in a wave of activity that saw large scale projects, including partially completed properties, abandoned. Many developers failed, while others, including those with government backing, entered into debt-restructuring deals with their lenders. By 2012 the market began picking up steam again. 2013 was a stellar year with prices accelerating significantly, however, the government and industry players began putting in place measures that would safeguard against another bubble developing. One notable difference is the number of cash buyers compared to those in previous years that borrowed heavily. Part of the reason for the current cash surge is the influx of investment from troubled countries.\nIn September 2013, the Dubai Land Department increased property transfer fees from 2 to 4%. In early 2014 the government regulator imposed restrictions on outside-companies acquiring real estate in the emirate, insisting such companies had to have a presence in Dubai, and had to be owned by a natural person or persons, and not by another company. The measures were largely seen as a means to dampen speculation in property prices.\nMajor real estate companies in Dubai actively attract new investors from abroad, concluding partnerships with real estate portals and investment foundations. In 2018, &lt;a href=\"Ellington%20Properties\"&gt;Ellington Properties&lt;/a&gt; signed a partnership with \"Beike\", one of the major China's real estate listings portals. As per the agreement, Beike \"will build awareness of \"Ellington\"s premium Dubai real estate offering to Chinese investors\"\nIn July 2019, more than 500 people lost their jobs following an economic downfall observed in the second quarter of 2019, following which &lt;a href=\"Jumeirah%20%28hotel%20chain%29\"&gt;Jumeirah Group LLC&lt;/a&gt; implemented job cuts. Dubai's economy weighs in on its tourism sector. Hotel occupancy fell to 67% in the second quarter of 2019, the lowest second-quarter occupancy since 2009. &lt;a href=\"JLL%20%28company%29\"&gt;JLL&lt;/a&gt; predicted at the time that \"further declines in performance are expected over the next 12 months before the hotel market recovers on the back of strong visitor arrivals growth associated with Expo 2020.\"\nAs a result of the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, real estate prices and overall demand for property dropped in 2020. Cavendish Maxwell, a realty consultancy, found that apartment prices in Dubai fell 12% from Q1 2019 to Q1 2020. In contrast, the estate agent firm &lt;a href=\"Chestertons\"&gt;Chestertons&lt;/a&gt; saw the rental market perform better, with an average decrease of only 1.5% in apartment rental prices in Q1 2020.\nTransport.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Transport\"&gt;transport sector&lt;/a&gt; is one of the main drivers of &lt;a href=\"economic%20growth\"&gt;economic growth&lt;/a&gt; in Dubai. The value of the transport and storage sector reached $12.5 billion in 2017, accounting for 11.2% of Dubai\u2019s economy.\nIn 2018, the sector was the second-largest contributor to the total GDP, contributing $48.8 billion to GDP - 12.3% of the total GDP, an increase of 2.1% from $47.7 billion in 2017.\nConstruction.\nSince 2000, Dubai's municipality has initiated construction phases in the city, predominantly in the Mina Seyahi area, located further from &lt;a href=\"Jumeirah\"&gt;Jumeirah&lt;/a&gt;, towards Jebel Ali. This has come at a cost however. Dubai ( and UAE ) construction companies employ low-wage labourers from Asia for up to 12 hours a day, six or seven days a week. These workers often have their passports withheld and are threatened if they speak to media. During the 1990s and 2000s, many workers staged protests and those who were expats were deported.\nIn 2002 a change was made to the law allowing non-nationals of the UAE to own property (not land) in Dubai as &lt;a href=\"fee%20simple\"&gt;fee simple&lt;/a&gt;, and 99-year leases are sold to people with ownership remaining with private companies. Property companies include &lt;a href=\"Nakheel%20Properties\"&gt;Nakheel Properties&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emaar%20Properties\"&gt;Emaar Properties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ellington%20Properties\"&gt;Ellington Properties&lt;/a&gt;. Rent rises were capped at 7% per annum up to 2007 under a directive from &lt;a href=\"Mohammed%20bin%20Rashid%20Al%20Maktoum\"&gt;Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum&lt;/a&gt;. Legislation in this area is still developing as the property market for foreigners is relatively new.\nProperty prices in Dubai have experienced a downfall since 2014. A difference of more than 25 percent has been noted. More than two-year ago Dubai's Creek Tower construction started, but no completion date is in sight yet. A cutback on the construction project has come into the scene since followed by realty developers postponing supplier payments. Consultancy firms like JLL cite the falling property prices to continue in 2019. Despite the economic slump and a relatively slower growth expectation, the estimated cost of &lt;a href=\"Expo%202020\"&gt;Expo 2020&lt;/a&gt; construction has reached AED38 billion ($10.3 billion).\nDiamonds.\n&lt;a href=\"Dubai\"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; is one of the world's largest &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; trading hubs alongside &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;. It handled in $35 billion worth of rough and polished diamonds in 2010, a surge from $3 million a decade earlier. In the first half of 2011, &lt;a href=\"Dubai\"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; traded $25.3 billion, a 55% rise from the first half of 2010.\nDubai has become the world's third largest diamond trading hub, with trade of rough and cut diamonds increasing since 2001. The emirate's diamond trade was virtually nonexistent at the beginning of the 2000s, but was worth nearly $35 billion in 2013 and 2014. The emirate has been able to leverage off its geographical position between major supplies of mined diamonds in &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, to the main cutting centres in &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and further east in &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a perception of Dubai as a buying hub for consumers of diamonds jewellery, due to the large number of jewellers in the emirate and the tax-free business regime. The customs duties of 1% in 2011 contributed to the UAE\u2019s competing with traditional diamond centers. In 2018, the UAE rolled back the 5% &lt;a href=\"Value-added%20tax\"&gt;value added tax (VAT)&lt;/a&gt; for wholesale diamond investors.\nThe diamond trading takes on an exchange managed by the &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Multi%20Commodities%20Centre\"&gt;Dubai Multi Commodities Centre&lt;/a&gt;, with many of the industry participants housed in office space in the &lt;a href=\"Almas%20Tower\"&gt;Almas Tower&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Jumeirah%20Lakes%20Towers\"&gt;JLT&lt;/a&gt; business cluster. Facilities there include Kimberley Process Certification offices and access to secure transportation agencies such as Brinks and Transguard, in addition to networking and meeting rooms. The &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Multi%20Commodities%20Centre\"&gt;DMCC&lt;/a&gt; houses over a thousand precious stone companies, both Emirati and foreign.\nIn Sep. 2019, the &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Multi%20Commodities%20Centre\"&gt;Dubai Multi Commodities Center&lt;/a&gt; launched the world\u2019s largest trading floor, with 41 fully-secured tables and high-level security measures, at the Dubai Diamond Exchange (DDE) in the Almas Tower.\nRight after the &lt;a href=\"Israel%E2%80%93United%20Arab%20Emirates%20normalization%20agreement\"&gt;UAE-Israeli accord&lt;/a&gt;, Israeli diamond trader Zvi Shimshi launched a company in Dubai and 37 other Israeli contacted the DMCC to establish a presence in Dubai. Later in 2020, the DMCC launched a representative outpost in the &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Diamond%20Exchange\"&gt;Israel Diamond Exchange (IDE)&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen trading relations between the two markets and help Israeli businesses establish a presence in Dubai. \u00a0\nGold.\nTrade in gold grew during the 1940s due to Dubai's &lt;a href=\"free%20trade\"&gt;free trade&lt;/a&gt; policies that encouraged entrepreneurs from &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; to set up stores in the &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Gold%20Souk\"&gt;Dubai Gold Souk&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a general slump in the global gold market, Dubai's share of value of trade in gold and diamonds to its total non-oil direct trade increased from 18% in 2003, to 24% in 2004. In 2003, the value of trade in gold in Dubai was approximately &lt;a href=\"Dirham\"&gt;Dh.&lt;/a&gt; 21 billion (&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Dollar\"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;5.8 billion), while trade in diamonds was approximately &lt;a href=\"Dirham\"&gt;Dh.&lt;/a&gt; 25 billion (&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Dollar\"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;7 billion) in 2005. &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; is Dubai's largest buyer of gold, accounting for approximately 23% of the emirate's total gold trade in 2005. &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; was Dubai's largest supplier of gold &lt;a href=\"ingot\"&gt;ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, wastes and scrap. Similarly, India accounted for approximately 68% of all diamond-related trade in Dubai; &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;'s share in Dubai's diamond trade was about 13% (2005).\nIn 2014, Dubai accounted for about 25% of the world\u2019s annual gold trade, competing with &lt;a href=\"Shanghai\"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.\nA June 2019 report by &lt;a href=\"The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal\"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; reported, the government of &lt;a href=\"Venezuela\"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;a href=\"Nicol%C3%A1s%20Maduro\"&gt;Nicol\u00e1s Maduro&lt;/a&gt; sold 7.4 tons of gold ingots, worth $300 million through illicit channels to evade &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20sanctions\"&gt;US sanctions&lt;/a&gt;. In March 2019, the billions passed through African Gold Refinery (AGR) in &lt;a href=\"Uganda\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;, and were later exported to Dubai.\nA &lt;a href=\"Reuters\"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; investigation in 2019 revealed that billions of dollars\u2019 worth of gold were smuggled from &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; to Dubai. As per customs data retrieved by Reuters, the UAE imported $15.1 billion worth of gold from Africa in 2016, a surge from $1.3 billion in 2006. However, much of the exported gold was not recorded by African states.\nThe &lt;a href=\"London%20Bullion%20Market%20Association\"&gt;London Bullion Market Association (LMBA)&lt;/a&gt; threatened in a Nov. 2020 letter to ban countries with large gold markets, including the UAE, from entering the mainstream market if they fail to meet regulatory standards. While the letter did not specify a center, four people involved in drafting it said its main focus was the gold industry in Dubai.\nIndustry and manufacturing.\nDubai is also home to some significant industrial ventures in energy production through &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.dewa.gov.ae/default.aspx\"&gt;DEWA&lt;/a&gt;, although this is primarily water and power production for Dubai. In the aluminum industry Emirates Global Aluminum produces 2.4 million tonnes of aluminum per year (~$3.8B USD in revenue). Investments were made in car manufacturing with Zarooq Motors; the start of UAE car industry. Production and sales were due to begin in 2016 but seem to have run into some trouble insofar as no cars have actually been manufactured. &lt;a href=\"DP%20World\"&gt;Dubai Ports&lt;/a&gt; is also an example of industrialization in Dubai.\nForeign Investment.\nIn 2002, Dubai allowed foreigners to own real estate, and the global real estate consulting firm &lt;a href=\"JLL%20%28company%29\"&gt;Jones Lang LaSalle&lt;/a&gt; named Dubai, along with &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Las%20Vegas\"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, its \u201cWorld Winning City,\u201d a research program aimed at identifying the future\u2019s most attractive property markets.\nDubai\u2019s Department of Economic Development issued on June 3, 2021 guidelines stating that it was no longer compulsory for foreign investors to have Emirati partners or specify a quota ratio for them, which means that foreigners have been allowed full ownership of businesses in Dubai, in order to speed up the country\u2019s economic recovery following the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as the decision was issued in June 2021, investors in Dubai took advantage of it.\nCOVID-19 Impact.\n&lt;a href=\"Capital%20Economics\"&gt;Capital Economics&lt;/a&gt;, a UK-based consultancy firm, described Dubai as \u201cthe most vulnerable of the economies in the &lt;a href=\"MENA\"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt; to the economic damage from such (&lt;a href=\"lockdown\"&gt;lockdown&lt;/a&gt;) measures\u201d and speculated that the emirate\u2019s economy would \u201ccontract by at least 5-6%\u201d in 2020 if the measures were still in force until the summer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"coronavirus\"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; crisis added to several years of declining revenues for a number of Dubai\u2019s most important sectors.\nIn April 2020, an estimate of 70% of Dubai\u2019s companies expected to go out of business by November 2020 due to the strict lockdown measures imposed to control the spread of &lt;a href=\"coronavirus\"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; (COVID-19), according to a survey by the &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce%20and%20Industry\"&gt;Dubai Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;. Half of the restaurants and hotels included in the survey, as well as about 74% of travel and tourism companies and 30% of transport, storage, and communications companies, expected to go out of business within a month.\n&lt;a href=\"Expo%202020\"&gt;Expo 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which was expected to attract 25 million visitors to Dubai, stimulate the economy, and mark the start of 50 years of achievements, was postponed to Oct. 1, 2021 due to the pandemic and associated travel restrictions."
