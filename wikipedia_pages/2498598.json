    "text": "Saint James United Church () is a heritage &lt;a href=\"church%20%28building%29\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; in the city's &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Montreal\"&gt;downtown core&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. It is a &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; church affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"United%20Church%20of%20Canada\"&gt;United Church of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. It is located at 463 &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Catherine%20Street\"&gt;Saint Catherine Street&lt;/a&gt; West between Saint Alexandre and City Councillors Streets (&lt;a href=\"McGill%20station\"&gt;McGill&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Montreal%20Metro\"&gt;metro&lt;/a&gt; station), in the borough of &lt;a href=\"Ville-Marie%20%28Montreal%29\"&gt;Ville-Marie&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Montreal\"&gt;Downtown Montreal&lt;/a&gt;. It was designated as a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Sites%20of%20Canada\"&gt;National Historic Site of Canada&lt;/a&gt; in 1996.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic Revival&lt;/a&gt; church was designed by Montreal architect &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Francis%20Dunlop\"&gt;Alexander Francis Dunlop&lt;/a&gt;. It is noteworthy for its false &lt;a href=\"apse\"&gt;apse&lt;/a&gt; housing church offices and for its &lt;a href=\"Casavant%20Fr%C3%A8res\"&gt;Casavant Fr\u00e8res&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"organ%20%28instrument%29\"&gt;organ&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWhen it was built in June 1889, it was the largest &lt;a href=\"Methodist\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt; church in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, with 2,000 seats; it was nicknamed the \"Cathedral Church of Methodism.\" It now belongs to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Church%20of%20Canada\"&gt;United Church of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, into which the Canadian Methodists merged in 1925. Its congregation founded the first &lt;a href=\"YMCA\"&gt;YMCA&lt;/a&gt; in North America on November 25, 1851 (before the present church building was built) and led an active campaign for &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20suffrage\"&gt;women's suffrage&lt;/a&gt; early in the 20th century.\nA &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; memorial window (1924) by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20William%20Kelsey\"&gt;Charles William Kelsey&lt;/a&gt; depicting a trench scene at St. James United Church (Montreal) was dedicated to 32 members who were killed overseas and 267 others who served in the Great War. The side lights represent the cardinal virtues, &lt;a href=\"Justice\"&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prudence\"&gt;Prudence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Temperance%20%28virtue%29\"&gt;Temperance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20virtues\"&gt;Fortitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1927, to cover upkeep costs, the church permitted a commercial building to be built in front of its &lt;a href=\"Sainte%20Catherine%20Street\"&gt;Sainte Catherine Street&lt;/a&gt; fa\u00e7ade. The building, adjoining the church's structure, concealed the church for over 78 years, the church itself being announced by a large &lt;a href=\"neon%20sign\"&gt;neon sign&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2005, as part of an $8-million restoration effort sponsored by the city of Montreal and the Quebec government, a portion of the commercial buildings were demolished, once again revealing the facade of the church as well as a new &lt;a href=\"public%20square\"&gt;public square&lt;/a&gt; designed by Quebec architect &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Cormier\"&gt;Claude Cormier&lt;/a&gt;. Access has also been restored to the rear lawn from Sainte Catherine Street."
