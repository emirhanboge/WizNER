    "text": "This overview shows the regulations regarding military service of &lt;a href=\"non-heterosexuals\"&gt;non-heterosexuals&lt;/a&gt; around the world.\nCountries that allow openly gay, lesbian and bisexual people to serve.\nConceptions and categories of sexual orientation are not universal. Language contained in the following entries, as much as possible, reflects local usage or official doctrine.\nAlbania.\nGays and lesbians have been allowed to serve in the &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Albania\"&gt;Military of Albania&lt;/a&gt; since 2008.\nArgentina.\nAs of 2009, the Argentine government has officially ended the ban on homosexuals in the &lt;a href=\"Armed%20Forces%20of%20the%20Argentine%20Republic\"&gt;Argentine Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. A new military justice system was put into effect which decriminalizes homosexuality among uniformed members, and moves crimes committed exclusively within the military to the public justice sphere [previously there had been a separate military court system].\nUnder the old system, homosexuals were not permitted to have access to a military career, at the same time as this sexual orientation was penalized. And, while there are no publicly known former sanctions against homosexuals under the old policy, this does not mean that men and women with that sexual orientation have not been disciplined, and perhaps separated from the armed forces under a mantle of silence. In fact, with this new system, homosexuals who wish to train in the forces should encounter no impediment, nor any military retaliation.\nAustralia.\n&lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has allowed homosexuals to serve openly since 1992.\nAustria.\nAustria permits homosexuals to serve openly in the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Austrian Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nBahamas.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Bahamas%20Defence%20Force\"&gt;Royal Bahamas Defence Force&lt;/a&gt; does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. The government made the announcement in 1998.\nBelgium.\nBelgium permits homosexuals to serve openly in the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Belgian Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. In Belgium, the military accepts gay men and lesbians into service. However, if the behaviour of an individual who is gay or lesbian causes problems, that individual is subject to discipline or discharge. In some cases, homosexual personnel have been transferred from their unit if they have been too open with their sexuality. The Belgian military also continues to reserve the right to deny gay and lesbian personnel high-level security clearances, for fear they may be susceptible to blackmail.\nBermuda.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Bermuda\"&gt;Military of Bermuda&lt;/a&gt; does not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation, as it is formed by random lottery-style &lt;a href=\"conscription\"&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt;. Officially, members of the &lt;a href=\"Bermuda%20Regiment\"&gt;Bermuda Regiment&lt;/a&gt; are prohibited from discriminating against or harassing soldiers on the basis of sexual orientation; such activities, however, are tolerated by officers, to the extent that one conscript described the Regiment as \"the most homophobic environment that exists\".\nBolivia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Armed%20Forces%20of%20Bolivia\"&gt;Armed Forces of Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; announced in 2013 that LGBT citizens would be allowed to serve beginning in 2015.\nBrazil.\nThere is no law forbidding lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people from serving in the &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Brazilian Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. Sexual orientation and gender identity cannot be an obstacle for entry into the police force or the military in Brazil, and some &lt;a href=\"trans%20women\"&gt;trans women&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Travesti%20%28gender%20identity%29\"&gt;travesti&lt;/a&gt;s should make &lt;a href=\"conscription\"&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt;, like some Brazilian male citizens. All sexual acts are disallowed between members of the forces, be they heterosexual or homosexual.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;Constitution of Brazil&lt;/a&gt; prohibits any form of &lt;a href=\"Anti-discrimination%20laws%20in%20Brazil\"&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt; in the country. The Brazilian Armed Forces does not permit &lt;a href=\"desertion\"&gt;desertion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Human%20sexual%20activity\"&gt;sexual acts&lt;/a&gt; or congeners in the military, whether heterosexual or homosexual. They claim that it is not a homophobic rule, but a rule of &lt;a href=\"discipline\"&gt;discipline&lt;/a&gt; that also includes the opposite sex.\nIn 2008, during the disappearance of a military gay couple, the Ministry of Defence of Brazil spoke: \"the sergeant is to be questioned about alleged &lt;a href=\"desertion\"&gt;desertion&lt;/a&gt; from the military and there is no question of discrimination.\" The two soldiers said they had been in a stable relationship for ten years in the Brazilian military.\nNo information currently exists as to whether military personnel can have their same-sex relationships recognized by the military, despite the fact that federal government employees can receive benefits for their same-sex spouses. Following the Supreme Federal Tribunal &lt;a href=\"ADI%204277%20and%20ADPF%20132\"&gt;decision in favor of civil unions&lt;/a&gt;, Defense Minister &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20Jobim\"&gt;Nelson Jobim&lt;/a&gt; guaranteed the Ministry's compliance with the decision and mentioned that spousal benefits can be accorded to same-sex spouses of military personnel.\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA) in 2012, 63.7% of &lt;a href=\"Brazilians\"&gt;Brazilians&lt;/a&gt; support the entry of LGBTs in the Brazilian Armed Forces, and do not see it as a problem.\nBulgaria.\nBulgaria's Protection Against Discrimination Act of 2003 protects individuals from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in relation to recruitment to the military.\nCanada.\nAs of 1992, lesbians, gays and bisexuals are allowed to serve openly in the military. A study of gays and lesbians in the Canadian military has found that after Canada's 1992 decision to allow homosexuals to serve openly in its armed forces, military performance did not decline.\nThe study is the most comprehensive academic study by US researchers of homosexuality in a foreign military ever compiled and reflects an exhaustive inventory of relevant data and research. Its title is \"Effects of the 1992 Lifting of Restrictions on Gay and Lesbian Service in the Canadian Forces; Appraising the Evidence\".\nA news article by Canadian journalist, Jon Tattrie, reported on the changed attitude towards the presence of homosexual members of the Canadian Forces in his article \"Being Gay in the Military\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Metro%20International\"&gt;Metro Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;\"), quoting Canadian Forces spokesperson Rana Sioufi as saying: \"Members who are same-sex partners are entitled to the same respect and dignity as heterosexual married couples or common-law partners.\"\nChile.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Chile\"&gt;Military of Chile&lt;/a&gt; does not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation. Chile bans all anti-gay discrimination since 2012.\nOn August 13, 2014, The Defense Ministry ordered the creation of a new committee to monitor inclusion and tackle discrimination in the armed forces, a move hailed as a \"historic\" step by gay rights campaigners.\nMarcos Robledo, defense undersecretary, announced the formation of a Diversity and Anti-Discrimination Committee with the aim to eradicate arbitrary discrimination in the military.\nThe resolution, signed by Defense Minister Jorge Burgos, established the government as responsible for creating a more inclusive armed services.\nFew days later, a sailor in Chile became the first serving member of the Chilean armed forces to announce he is gay. Mauricio Ruiz, 24, told a televised news conference his decision had \"not been easy\", but he wanted to help fight discrimination against homosexuals. Mr Ruiz said that what was most important was not a soldier's sexual orientation, but his or her willingness to serve the country. His announcement came with the full backing of the Chilean armed.\nMauricio Ruiz said homosexuals had \"no reason to hide\". \"We can do anything, be marines or in any branch (of the military). We can do whatever profession, and we deserve as much respect as anyone else,\" he told reporters in the Chilean capital, Santiago. \"In life there's nothing better than to be yourself, to be authentic, to look at people in the eye and for those people to know who you are.\"\nRolando Jimenez, president of Chile's Movement for Integration and Homosexual Liberation, expressed his gratitude to the Chilean Navy. \"(The Navy is) telling the country and the members of the institution particularly that it is possible for gays and lesbians to be part of the armed forces and that they aren't going to suffer discrimination because of their sexual orientation within these institutions,\" Mr Jimenez said.\nColombia.\nIn 1999 the Colombian Constitutional Court ruled that the prohibition of homosexuals from serving in the armed forces is unconstitutional and members of the LGBT community may serve openly.\nCroatia.\nLGBT persons are not banned from participation in military service. &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Croatia%29\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; has no internal rules regard LGBT persons, but it follows regulation at the state level which explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Some media reports have suggested that most gay men serving in the military generally decide to keep their sexual orientation private, but there have also been reports suggesting that the &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Croatia\"&gt;Croatian Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; take discrimination very seriously and will not tolerate homophobia among its personnel.\nCyprus.\nHomosexuals used to be banned from serving in the Cypriot Military. However, the 2011 National Guard Law does not include a ban.\nDenmark.\nDenmark allows homosexuals to serve openly. There are prominent openly gay military leaders in the Danish Armed Forces and there are no reported cases of threats to gays, morale, or national security. A study of the conditions for gay men indicates that gay men in the Danish Armed Forces show strength and are respected.\nEcuador.\nPrior to the decriminalization of homosexuality in Ecuador in 1997, LGBT people couldn't openly serve in the military, as article 87 of the Ley de Personal de Fuerzas Armadas stipulated that any conscript that violated a law had to be separated from the military. One year after the decriminalization of homosexuality, Ecuador's army released a military discipline regulation that included the practice of same-sex sexual acts among the reasons for discharge. This article was removed in 2009, which finally allowed LGBT to openly serve in the army. However, there was a case of a soldier discharged in 2014 who denounced that the act was motivated by the fact that he was gay. His officials, on the other hand, insisted that his sexual orientation, which was publicly known since 2010, had nothing to do with his discharge.\nEstonia.\nEstonia allows homosexuals to serve openly in the &lt;a href=\"Military%20of%20Estonia\"&gt;Military of Estonia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinland.\nFinland allows homosexuals to serve openly in the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Defence%20Forces\"&gt;Finnish Defence Forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrance.\nFrance allows homosexuals to serve openly. Although homosexuals are not banned, they may face greater challenges than their heterosexual counterparts. Commanders and psychiatrists who believe gay and lesbian personnel are disrupting their units can discharge them.\nGermany.\nThe German &lt;a href=\"Bundeswehr\"&gt;Bundeswehr&lt;/a&gt; ruled that it is forbidden to discriminate based on sexual orientation. The \"Working Committee of Homosexual Employees in the Military Forces\" is the organization that represents the interests of gay men and lesbians in the armed forces. Heterosexuals and homosexuals alike are allowed to engage in sexual activity while in the military service as long as it does not interfere with the performance of their duties. Lesbian and gay soldiers are also entitled to enter civil unions as defined by Germany's domestic \"partnership\" law.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bundeswehr\"&gt;Bundeswehr&lt;/a&gt; maintained a \"&lt;a href=\"glass%20ceiling\"&gt;glass ceiling&lt;/a&gt;\" policy that effectively banned homosexuals from becoming officers until 2000. First Lieutenant Winfried Stecher, an army officer demoted for his homosexuality, filed a lawsuit against former Defense Minister &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20Scharping\"&gt;Rudolf Scharping&lt;/a&gt;. Scharping vowed to fight the claim in court, claiming that homosexuality \"raises serious doubts about suitability and excludes employment in all functions pertaining to leadership.\" However, before the case went to trial, the Defense Ministry reversed the discriminatory policy. While the German government declined to issue an official explanation for the reversal, it is widely believed that Scharping was overruled by then Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Gerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der\"&gt;Gerhard Schr\u00f6der&lt;/a&gt; and then Vice-Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Joschka%20Fischer\"&gt;Joschka Fischer&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrently, according to general military orders given in the year 2000, tolerance towards all sexual orientations is considered to be part of the duty of military personnel. Sexual relationships and acts amongst soldiers outside service times, regardless of the sexual orientation, are defined to be \"irrelevant\", regardless of the rank and function of the soldier(s) involved, while harassment or the abuse of functions is considered a transgression, as well as the performance of sexual acts in active service.\nGreece.\nWhile the Presidential Decree 133 (of 2002) allowed people to avoid the draft for deep psycho-sexual problems, it did not ban homosexuals from the army. The newer 2005 law 3421 has removed even the wording that could be misconstrued as offensive to homosexuals. In recent years, the Hellenic army has been shortening the length of conscription and hiring more and more professional soldiers and there hasn't been any incident of someone being fired for homosexuality.\nIsrael.\nA policy in 1983 allowed prospective Israeli soldiers to be questioned about their sexual orientation. Scholars Ben-Ari and Kaplan suggested that the prospective soldiers' responses affected what military unit they would be assigned to. However, the 1993 policy was put into effect to remove the 1983 policy. &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Defense%20Forces\"&gt;Israel Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt; policies allow gay men and lesbians to serve openly and without discrimination or harassment due to actual or perceived sexual orientation. This was put into effect in 1993 after an IDF reserves officer testified before the &lt;a href=\"Knesset\"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt; claiming that his rank had been revoked, and that he had been barred from researching sensitive topics in military intelligence, solely because of his sexual identity.\nHomosexuals serve openly in the military, including special units, without any discrimination. Moreover, homosexuals in the IDF have additional rights, such as the right to take a shower alone if they want to. According to a &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Barbara\"&gt;University of California, Santa Barbara&lt;/a&gt; study, a brigadier general stated that Israelis show a \"great tolerance\" for gay soldiers. Consul &lt;a href=\"David%20Saranga\"&gt;David Saranga&lt;/a&gt; at the Israeli Consulate in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, who was interviewed by the \"St. Petersburg Times\", said, \"It's a non-issue. You can be a very good officer, a creative one, a brave one, and be gay at the same time.\"\nIn a comprehensive review of interviews with all known experts on homosexuality in the IDF in 2004, researchers were not able to find any data suggesting that Israel's decision to lift its gay ban undermined operational effectiveness, combat readiness, unit cohesion or morale. In this security-conscious country where the military is considered to be essential to the continued existence of the nation, the decision to include sexual minorities has not harmed IDF effectiveness.\nWhile no official statistics are available for harassment rates of sexual minorities in the IDF, scholars, military officials and representatives of gay organizations alike assert that vicious harassment is rare. A study published by the &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Gay%20Youth\"&gt;Israel Gay Youth&lt;/a&gt; Movement in January 2012 found that half of the homosexual soldiers who serve in the IDF suffer from violence and homophobia.\nEven though the law states that gay soldiers cannot be discriminated against by the Israeli military, does not mean it does not occur between soldiers. Ben-Ari and Kaplan, the scholars who wrote \u201cSexual Orientation and Military Service\u201d, discovered that gay Israeli soldiers faced discrimination from their fellow military men because they were viewed as mentally ill, lonely, and insecure. Ben- Ari and Kaplan cited a study about how an Israeli soldier's sexual partner preference influenced the way they were treated. The study conveyed that soldiers bonded in the Israeli military through homophobic remarks and sexualizing women. There was another study that scholars Ben-Ari and Kaplan created that determined how gay Israeli soldiers responded to the macho man stereotype in the military. Gay soldiers either isolated themselves from the rest of the soldiers or attempted to adapt to heterosexual norms. In the end, gay soldiers' military performance was not affected by their response but their integration into the military was affected.\nJapan.\n&lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; does not have any rules applying to homosexuals serving in the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Self-Defense%20Forces\"&gt;Self-Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Japan Self-Defense Forces, when being asked about their policy toward gays and lesbians following the U.S. debate during the &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; presidency, answered that it was not an issue, and individuals within the forces indicated that as long as same-sex relations did not lead to fights or other trouble, there were few, if any, barriers to their inclusion in the armed services.\nLatvia.\nLatvia allows homosexuals to serve openly.\nLithuania.\nLithuania allows lesbian, gay, and bisexual people to serve openly.\nLuxembourg.\nLuxembourg allows homosexuals to serve openly.\nNetherlands.\nIn 1974, the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; was the first country to ban discrimination against gays in the military. The Dutch government considered homosexuality grounds for dismissal until 1974, when the Association of Dutch Homosexuals convinced the Minister of Defense that gays posed no threat to national security. The Dutch military formed a working group called Homosexuality and Armed Forces to improve the climate for sexual minorities. In the 1980s, this group became the Homosexuality and Armed Forces Foundation, a trade union that continues to represent gay and lesbian personnel to the Ministry of Defense.\nNorway.\nNorway allows homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces. &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, like most of &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;, is very &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; in regards to LGBT-rights and it also became the first country in the world to enact an anti-discrimination law protecting homosexuals in certain areas.\nThe Norwegian government states: \"Anyone who in written or verbal form is threatening, scorning, persecuting, or spiteful toward a gay or lesbian person will be punished with fines or prison of up to two years.\"\nPhilippines.\nThe Philippine government has officially ended, as of 2010, the ban on gays in the military.\nIn July 2012, the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Military%20Academy\"&gt;Philippine Military Academy&lt;/a&gt; announced that it has welcomed openly gay and lesbian applicants into its fold, giving them the opportunity to serve in the military.\nPortugal.\nPortugal allows all citizens to serve openly in the military regardless of sexual orientation, as the constitution explicitly forbids any discrimination on that basis, therefore openly allowing lesbians and gays to serve in the military.\nIn April 2016, Portugal's armed forces chief General Carlos Jer\u00f3nimo resigned, days after being summoned to explain comments about gay soldiers made by the deputy head of the military college. President &lt;a href=\"Marcelo%20Rebelo%20de%20Sousa\"&gt;Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa&lt;/a&gt; accepted the resignation of Jer\u00f3nimo, who took up the post of chief of staff in 2014. The resignation came after Ant\u00f3nio Grilo, deputy head of the military college, admitted advising parents of young military students in the Portuguese army to withdraw their sons if they were gay \"to protect them from the other students\". &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20National%20Defense%20%28Portugal%29\"&gt;Defence Minister&lt;/a&gt; Azeredo Lopes considered any discrimination \"absolutely unacceptable\".\nRomania.\nHomosexuals are allowed to serve openly in the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20army\"&gt;Romanian army&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Ministry of Defence's recruitment policy, \"it is the right of every Romanian citizen to take part in the military structures of our country, regardless of their sexual orientation.\"\nSan Marino.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sammarinese%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Sammarinese Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; does not explicitly ban LGBT people from serving. The &lt;a href=\"code%20of%20conduct\"&gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt; of the police force prohibits unfair discrimination in recruitment. Furthermore, police officials are trained to properly respond to and identify discrimination, whether in public or within the police force itself.\nSerbia.\nIn May 2010, the head of the Serbian military (&lt;a href=\"Vojska%20Srbije\"&gt;Vojska Srbije&lt;/a&gt;) announced that the Serbian Army would accept homosexuals to join. However, this news was not widely covered by media.\nSlovenia.\nSlovenia allows individuals to serve openly without discrimination or harassment due to actual or perceived sexual orientation.\nSpain.\nHomosexuals are allowed to serve openly in the Spanish Army. As of 2009, after the case of Aitor G.R, the courts also ruled that transgender individuals are also permitted to serve in the military.\nSweden.\nSweden allows homosexuals to serve openly and was amongst the first nations in the world to allow LGBT people to do so. Gay men could serve openly even before homosexuality was demedicalized (in 1979), as there was no ban on homosexuality in the nation's military. Since 1987 all kind of discrimination, military employment included, due to sexual orientation is banned by constitution. Since 2008 this ban also includes transgender people.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Swedish Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; states that it actively work for an environment where individuals do not feel it to be necessary to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2015, they launched a Pride campaign featuring a soldier in uniform with the rainbow flag badget to her arm. The text's bold letters translates to \"Some things you should not have to camouflage,\" followed by the text \"Equality is an essential ingredient in a democracy,\" say the Swedish Armed Forces. \"In the military, we treat them with respect and see the differences of others as a fortress. We are an inclusive organisation where all the people who serve and contribute feel welcome and respected.\"\nSwitzerland.\nSwitzerland's military policies also allow for gay men and lesbians to serve openly without discrimination or harassment due to actual or perceived sexual orientation.\nTaiwan.\n&lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; repealed its ban on conscripting gay people into the military in 2002. Following an announcement by the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20China%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Republic of China Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; that it would end a policy banning gays from guarding high level officials and government installations, scholars and military officials said the decision signaled a bold step for an Asian military force. The policy change was announced after a local newspaper revealed the discriminatory practice, prompting protest demonstrations in Taipei, the nation's capital.\nCol. Liu of the ROC Naval Attache said that ending the ban on gays in the military police was \"a good thing for a democratic society like ours. I don't think this is really a big deal,\" he said. \"It just means Taiwanese society is more open and there are different choices now. If you're gay and you can do the job, that's fine.\"\nThailand.\nIn 2005, the Thai armed forces lifted its ban on &lt;a href=\"LGBT%20rights%20in%20Thailand\"&gt;LGBT&lt;/a&gt; serving in the military. Prior to this reform, LGBT people were exempted as suffering from a \"mental disorder\" law of 1954.\nUnited Kingdom.\nUntil 2000, the British &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; (MOD) policy was to continue the long-standing ban on homosexuals joining any of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. Since March 2014, UK military same-sex couples can get married (as well as UK civilians), under the &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Same%20Sex%20Couples%29%20Act%202013\"&gt;Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013&lt;/a&gt;. This law does not apply to &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; only.\nUnited States.\nHomosexuals are allowed to serve openly in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military. Military policy and legislation had previously entirely prohibited gay individuals from serving, and subsequently from serving openly, but these prohibitions were ended in September 2011 after the U.S. Congress voted to repeal the policy.\nThe first time homosexuals were differentiated from non-homosexuals in the military literature was in revised army mobilization regulations in 1942. Additional policy revisions in 1944 and 1947 further codified the ban. Throughout the next few decades, homosexuals were routinely discharged, regardless of whether they had engaged in sexual conduct while serving. In response to the &lt;a href=\"LGBT%20movements%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;gay rights movements&lt;/a&gt; of the 1970s and 1980s, including the famed &lt;a href=\"Vernon%20Berg%2C%20III\"&gt;\"Copy\" Berg case&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of Defense issued a 1982 policy (DOD Directive 1332.14) stating that homosexuality was clearly incompatible with military service. Controversy over this policy created political pressure to amend the policy, with &lt;a href=\"liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;socially liberal&lt;/a&gt; efforts seeking a repeal of the ban and &lt;a href=\"conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;socially conservative&lt;/a&gt; groups wishing to reinforce it by statute.\nA legislative policy was enacted in a 1993 bill signed by President &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. The new policy continued the ban under which homosexuals were prohibited from serving in the military and their discharge was required. The main change that the new policy made was to prohibit investigation into a member's sexual orientation without suspicion. The new policy was known as \"&lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20ask%2C%20don%27t%20tell\"&gt;Don't ask, don't tell&lt;/a&gt;\" and was seen as a compromise between the two political efforts.\nPressure to overturn the ban continued to build throughout the 1990s and 2000s, as public opposition to gay rights waned. In December 2010, the House and Senate, under a Democratic majority, passed a bill that President &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; signed into law as the &lt;a href=\"Don%27t%20Ask%2C%20Don%27t%20Tell%20Repeal%20Act%20of%202010\"&gt;Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010&lt;/a&gt;. The law established a future pathway to allow homosexuals to serve in the military. Under the terms of the bill, the \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy remained in place until the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff\"&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; certified that repeal would not harm military readiness, followed by a 60 days waiting period. In early 2011, military leaders began issuing training plans for the expected repeal of the ban. A court order on July 6, 2011, required the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense\"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; to immediately suspend the ban, which the government complied with. The legislative repeal of the ban took effect on September 20, 2011.\nOne year after repeal, a study published by the &lt;a href=\"Palm%20Center\"&gt;Palm Center&lt;/a&gt; found that openly gay service has not resulted in a negative net impact to the U.S. military.\nPer the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \"&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20v.%20Windsor\"&gt;United States v. Windsor&lt;/a&gt;\", lawful same-sex spouses are afforded the same rights as heterosexual spouses.\nUruguay.\nHomosexuals were prohibited from serving in the Uruguayan armed forces under the 1973\u20131985 military dictatorship, however this prohibition was lifted in 2009 when a new decree was signed by Defence Minister &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Bayardi\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Bayardi&lt;/a&gt; which provided that sexual orientation would no longer be considered a reason to prevent people from entering the armed forces.\nCountries with ambiguous policies.\nSouth Korea.\n&lt;a href=\"LGBT%20rights%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;Civil rights for homosexual citizens&lt;/a&gt; are guaranteed in South Korea under the Korean Human Rights Committee Law, but in practice homosexuals may still face discrimination during military service, which is &lt;a href=\"conscription%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;mandatory for all male citizens&lt;/a&gt;.
