    "text": "Mayaro is the name of a &lt;a href=\"Counties%20of%20Trinidad%20and%20Tobago\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; on southeastern &lt;a href=\"Trinidad\"&gt;Trinidad&lt;/a&gt; island, in &lt;a href=\"Trinidad%20and%20Tobago\"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe \"Mayaro District\" was the first area of settlement on the east coast. Many estates were granted to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; planters who settled &lt;a href=\"Trinidad\"&gt;Trinidad&lt;/a&gt; in the late 18th century. No roads crossed the island and the area was only accessible by steamer until the late 19th century. \nGeography.\nThe name Mayaro is applied to several villages along the coast. The &lt;a href=\"county\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; of Mayaro occupies a large area of southeastern Trinidad, but the name is usually only applied to the coastal strip. County Mayaro is divided into two &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt;s: Trinity and &lt;a href=\"Guayaguayare\"&gt;Guayaguayare&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlong this strip a number of villages exist to which the name Mayaro is generally applied. From north to south these are: Kernaham/Cascadou, &lt;a href=\"Ortoire%20%28village%29\"&gt;Ortoire&lt;/a&gt;, St. Joseph, Beau Sejour, Plaisance, Pierreville, Beaumont, St. Ann's, Radix, Ste. Marguerite, Lagon Doux, Grand Lagoon and Lagon Palmiste. Beyond that are several small villages and then the town of Guayaguayare. \nMayaro falls under the jurisdiction of the &lt;a href=\"Rio%20Claro%E2%80%93Mayaro%20Regional%20Corporation\"&gt;Rio Claro\u2013Mayaro Regional Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. Until 1990 it was administered together with the neighbouring county of &lt;a href=\"Nariva\"&gt;Nariva&lt;/a&gt; by the Nariva\u2013Mayaro County Council.\nEconomy.\nMayaro is also associated with oil production - most of Trinidad's &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"natural%20gas\"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; production comes from offshore oil fields to the east of Mayaro. The major producer is &lt;a href=\"BP\"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; Trinidad &amp; Tobago (bpTT), together with &lt;a href=\"BHP\"&gt;BHP&lt;/a&gt;. Onshore oil production is under the control of &lt;a href=\"Petrotrin\"&gt;Petrotrin&lt;/a&gt;, although a considerable area has been farmed out to small independent oil producers."
