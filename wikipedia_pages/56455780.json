The statement was released in several languages, including &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, Italian, Spanish and &lt;a href=\"Basque%20language\"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe unit took part in the 2016 &lt;a href=\"Manbij%20offensive\"&gt;Manbij offensive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Raqqa%20campaign%20%282016-2017%29\"&gt;Raqqa campaign (2016-2017)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Deir%20ez-Zor%20campaign%20%282017-19%29\"&gt;Deir ez-Zor campaign (2017-19)&lt;/a&gt;, and the resistance to the 2018 &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20invasion%20of%20Afrin\"&gt;Turkish invasion of Afrin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Turkish%20offensive%20into%20northeastern%20Syria\"&gt;2019 Turkish offensive into northeastern Syria&lt;/a&gt;."
