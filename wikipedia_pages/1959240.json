    "text": "Daniel Gottlieb Steibelt (October 22, 1765) was a German pianist and composer. His main works were composed in Paris and in London, and he died in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, Russia.\nBiography.\nSteibelt was born in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, and studied music with &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Kirnberger\"&gt;Johann Kirnberger&lt;/a&gt; before being forced by his father to join the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20Army\"&gt;Prussian Army&lt;/a&gt;. Deserting, he began a nomadic career as a pianist before settling in 1790 in Paris, where he attained great popularity as a &lt;a href=\"virtuoso\"&gt;virtuoso&lt;/a&gt; as the result of a &lt;a href=\"piano%20sonata\"&gt;piano sonata&lt;/a&gt; called \"La Coquette\", which he composed for &lt;a href=\"Marie%20Antoinette\"&gt;Marie Antoinette&lt;/a&gt;. Also in Paris, his dramatic &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; entitled \"Romeo et Juliette\", which was later highly regarded by &lt;a href=\"Hector%20Berlioz\"&gt;Hector Berlioz&lt;/a&gt;, was produced at the &lt;a href=\"Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20Feydeau\"&gt;Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Feydeau&lt;/a&gt; in 1793. This is held by many to be his most original and artistically successful composition.\nSteibelt began to share his time between Paris and &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, where his piano-playing attracted great attention. In 1797 he played in a concert of &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Peter%20Salomon\"&gt;J. P. Salamon&lt;/a&gt;. In 1798 he produced his &lt;a href=\"Concerto\"&gt;Concerto&lt;/a&gt; No. 3 in E containing a \"Storm Rondo\" characterized by extensive &lt;a href=\"tremolo\"&gt;tremolo&lt;/a&gt;s, which became very popular. In the following year Steibelt started on a professional tour in Germany; and, after playing with some success in &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, Berlin, &lt;a href=\"Dresden\"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;, he arrived at the end of March 1800 at &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, where he is reported to have challenged &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven\"&gt;Beethoven&lt;/a&gt; to a trial of skill at the house of &lt;a href=\"Count%20Moritz%20von%20Fries\"&gt;Count Moritz von Fries&lt;/a&gt;. The oft-quoted account by &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Ries\"&gt;Ferdinand Ries&lt;/a&gt; was written 37 years later; Ries did not attend it and became only later a student and friend of Beethoven. Ries describes how Beethoven carried the day by improvising at length on a theme taken from the cello part of a new Steibelt piece, placed upside down on the music rack. Reportedly, Steibelt stormed out of the room, never to set foot in Vienna again. Ries' account, however, contains two factual errors.\nFollowing this supposed public humiliation Steibelt ended his tour. (The date of his departure from Vienna is not known, while Beethoven did leave Vienna at the end of April or beginning of May: he played in Buda, Hungary, on 7 May.) Steibelt went again to Paris, where he organised the first performance of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Haydn\"&gt;Joseph Haydn&lt;/a&gt;'s oratorio \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Creation%20%28Haydn%29\"&gt;The Creation&lt;/a&gt;\", which took place on 24 December 1800 at the Opera House. On his way to it, &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;the First Consul Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt; narrowly escaped a bomb attack. Steibelt had just published one of his most accomplished sonatas, which he had dedicated to Bonaparte's wife, Josephine. After a second stay in England from March 1802 to March 1805, Steibelt returned to the continent, gave concerts in Brussels (April 1805), and was back in Paris in Summer. He celebrated Napoleon's triumph at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Austerlitz\"&gt;Austerlitz&lt;/a&gt; with a \"Musical Interlude\" named \"La F\u00eate de Mars\", whose premi\u00e8re was attended by Napoleon in person (4 February 1806).\nIn 1808 he was invited by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Tsar Alexander I&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, succeeding &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois-Adrien%20Boieldieu\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois-Adrien Boieldieu&lt;/a&gt; as director of the French Opera in 1811. He remained there for the rest of his life. In 1812, he composed \"The Conflagration of Moscow\", a grand fantasy for piano dedicated to the Russian nation. Steibelt generally ceased performing in 1814, but returned to the platform for his Concerto No. 8, which was premiered on March 16, 1820, in Saint Petersburg, and is notable for its choral finale. This was four years before Beethoven's unconventional &lt;a href=\"Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29\"&gt;Symphony No. 9&lt;/a&gt;, and was the only piano concerto ever written (excluding Beethoven's &lt;a href=\"Choral%20Fantasy\"&gt;Choral Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;) with a part for a chorus until &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Herz\"&gt;Henri Herz&lt;/a&gt;'s 6th concerto, Op. 192 (1858) and &lt;a href=\"Ferruccio%20Busoni\"&gt;Ferruccio Busoni&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Piano%20Concerto%20%28Busoni%29\"&gt;Piano Concerto&lt;/a&gt; (1904). Steibelt died in Saint Petersburg on September 20, 1823 (October 2, N.S.), following a prolonged illness.\nLegacy.\nBesides his dramatic music, Steibelt left behind him an enormous number of compositions, mostly for the piano. His playing was said to be brilliant, though lacking the higher qualities which characterized that of such contemporaries as &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Baptist%20Cramer\"&gt;Cramer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muzio%20Clementi\"&gt;Muzio Clementi&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, his playing and compositional skills enabled him to build a career across Europe. &lt;a href=\"The%20Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians\"&gt;Grove&lt;/a&gt; describes him as \"extraordinarily vain, arrogant, discourteous, recklessly extravagant and even dishonest.\" Such harsh moral judgements are justified by some of the facts of Steibelt's life as they have come down to us.\nSelected list of his works.\n1) Stage\n2) Orchestral\n3) Chamber\n4) Methode de Pianoforte (1805)\n5) Songs"
