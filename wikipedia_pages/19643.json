    "text": "The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (; , \"\", ) is one of the two major &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit%20literature\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Indian%20epic%20poetry\"&gt;epics&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ancient%20India\"&gt;ancient India&lt;/a&gt;, the other being the \"&lt;a href=\"Ramayana\"&gt;R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a&lt;/a&gt;\". It narrates the struggle between two groups of cousins in the &lt;a href=\"Kurukshetra%20War\"&gt;Kurukshetra War&lt;/a&gt; and the fates of the &lt;a href=\"Kaurava\"&gt;Kaurava&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pandava\"&gt;P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava&lt;/a&gt; princes and their successors.\nIt also contains &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20philosophy\"&gt;philosophical&lt;/a&gt; and devotional material, such as a discussion of the four \"goals of life\" or \"&lt;a href=\"purusharthas\"&gt;puru\u1e63\u0101rtha&lt;/a&gt;\" (12.161). Among the principal works and stories in the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" are the \"&lt;a href=\"Bhagavad%20Gita\"&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/a&gt;\", the story of &lt;a href=\"Damayanti\"&gt;Damayanti&lt;/a&gt;, the story of &lt;a href=\"Shakuntala\"&gt;Shakuntala&lt;/a&gt;, the story of &lt;a href=\"Pururava\"&gt;Pururava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Urvashi\"&gt;Urvashi&lt;/a&gt;, the story of &lt;a href=\"Savitri%20and%20Satyavan\"&gt;Savitri and Satyavan&lt;/a&gt;, the story of &lt;a href=\"Kacha%20%28sage%29\"&gt;Kacha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Devayani\"&gt;Devayani&lt;/a&gt;, the story of &lt;a href=\"Rishyasringa\"&gt;Rishyasringa&lt;/a&gt; and an abbreviated version of the \"&lt;a href=\"Ramayana\"&gt;R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a&lt;/a&gt;\", often considered as works in their own right.\nTraditionally, the authorship of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" is attributed to &lt;a href=\"Vyasa\"&gt;Vy\u0101sa&lt;/a&gt;. There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers. The bulk of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" was probably compiled between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE, with the oldest preserved parts not much older than around 400\u00a0BCE. The original events related by the epic probably fall between the 9th and 8th centuries BCE. The text probably reached its final form by the early &lt;a href=\"Gupta%20Empire\"&gt;Gupta period&lt;/a&gt; (c. 4th century CE).\nThe \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" is the longest epic poem known and has been described as \"the longest poem ever written\". Its longest version consists of over 100,000 \"&lt;a href=\"shloka\"&gt;\u015bloka&lt;/a&gt;\" or over 200,000 individual verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), and long prose passages. At about 1.8\u00a0million words in total, the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" is roughly ten times the length of the \"&lt;a href=\"Iliad\"&gt;Iliad&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Odyssey\"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;\" combined, or about four times the length of the &lt;a href=\"Ramayana\"&gt;R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a&lt;/a&gt;. W. J. Johnson has compared the importance of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" in the context of world civilization to that of the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Quran\"&gt;Quran&lt;/a&gt;, the works of &lt;a href=\"Homer\"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Greek drama&lt;/a&gt;, or the works of &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;. Within the Indian tradition it is sometimes called the &lt;a href=\"fifth%20Veda\"&gt;fifth Veda&lt;/a&gt;.\nTextual history and structure.\nThe epic is traditionally ascribed to the sage &lt;a href=\"Vyasa\"&gt;Vy\u0101sa&lt;/a&gt;, who is also a major character in the epic. Vy\u0101sa described it as being \"&lt;a href=\"Itihasa\"&gt;itih\u0101sa&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt;: \u0907\u0924\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0938, meaning \"history\"). He also describes the Guru-shishya parampara, which traces all great teachers and their students of the Vedic times.\nThe first section of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" states that it was &lt;a href=\"Ganesha\"&gt;Ganesha&lt;/a&gt; who wrote down the text to Vyasa's dictation, but this is regarded by scholars as a later interpolation to the epic and the \"Critical Edition\" doesn't include Ganesha at all.\nThe epic employs the &lt;a href=\"story%20within%20a%20story\"&gt;story within a story&lt;/a&gt; structure, otherwise known as &lt;a href=\"Frame%20story\"&gt;frametales&lt;/a&gt;, popular in many Indian religious and non-religious works. It is first recited at \"&lt;a href=\"Taxila\"&gt;Takshashila&lt;/a&gt;\" by the sage &lt;a href=\"Vaisampayana\"&gt;Vai\u015bamp\u0101yana&lt;/a&gt;, a disciple of Vy\u0101sa, to the King &lt;a href=\"Janamejaya%20II\"&gt;Janamejaya&lt;/a&gt; who was the great-grandson of the &lt;a href=\"Pandava\"&gt;P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava&lt;/a&gt; prince &lt;a href=\"Arjuna\"&gt;Arjuna&lt;/a&gt;. The story is then recited again by a professional storyteller named &lt;a href=\"Ugrasrava%20Sauti\"&gt;Ugra\u015brava Sauti&lt;/a&gt;, many years later, to an assemblage of sages performing the 12-year sacrifice for the king Saunaka Kulapati in the &lt;a href=\"Naimisha%20Forest\"&gt;Naimi\u015ba Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe text was described by some early 20th-century &lt;a href=\"Indology\"&gt;Indologists&lt;/a&gt; as unstructured and chaotic. &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20Oldenberg\"&gt;Hermann Oldenberg&lt;/a&gt; supposed that the original poem must once have carried an immense \"tragic force\" but dismissed the full text as a \"horrible chaos.\" &lt;a href=\"Moritz%20Winternitz\"&gt;Moritz Winternitz&lt;/a&gt; (\"Geschichte der indischen Literatur\" 1909) considered that \"only unpoetical theologists and clumsy scribes\" could have lumped the parts of disparate origin into an unordered whole.\nAccretion and redaction.\nResearch on the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" has put an enormous effort into recognizing and dating layers within the text. Some elements of the present \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" can be traced back to Vedic times. The background to the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" suggests the origin of the epic occurs \"after the very early &lt;a href=\"Vedic%20period\"&gt;Vedic period&lt;/a&gt;\" and before \"the first Indian 'empire' was to rise in the third century B.C.\" That this is \"a date not too far removed from the 8th or 9th century B.C.\" is likely. \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" started as an orally-transmitted tale of the charioteer &lt;a href=\"bard\"&gt;bard&lt;/a&gt;s. It is generally agreed that \"Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Vedas\"&gt;Vedas&lt;/a&gt;, which have to be preserved letter-perfect, the epic was a popular work whose reciters would inevitably conform to changes in language and style,\" so the earliest 'surviving' components of this dynamic text are believed to be no older than the earliest 'external' references we have to the epic, which may include an allusion in &lt;a href=\"P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini\"&gt;Panini&lt;/a&gt;'s 4th century BCE grammar A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b 4:2:56. It is estimated that the Sanskrit text probably reached something of a \"final form\" by the early &lt;a href=\"Gupta%20Empire\"&gt;Gupta period&lt;/a&gt; (about the 4th century CE). Vishnu Sukthankar, editor of the first great critical edition of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\", commented: \"It is useless to think of reconstructing a fluid text in an original shape, based on an archetype and a \"&lt;a href=\"stemma%20codicum\"&gt;stemma codicum&lt;/a&gt;\". What then is possible? Our objective can only be to reconstruct \"the oldest form of the text which it is possible to reach\" based on the manuscript material available.\" That manuscript evidence is somewhat late, given its material composition and the &lt;a href=\"climate%20of%20India\"&gt;climate of India&lt;/a&gt;, but it is very extensive.\nThe \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" itself (1.1.61) distinguishes a core portion of 24,000 verses: the \"Bh\u0101rata\" proper, as opposed to additional secondary material, while the \"&lt;a href=\"Grhya%20Sutras\"&gt;A\u015bval\u0101yana G\u1e5bhyas\u016btra&lt;/a&gt;\" (3.4.4) makes a similar distinction. At least three redactions of the text are commonly recognized: \"Jaya\" (Victory) with 8,800 verses attributed to &lt;a href=\"Vyasa\"&gt;Vy\u0101sa&lt;/a&gt;, \"Bh\u0101rata\" with 24,000 verses as recited by &lt;a href=\"Vaisampayana\"&gt;Vai\u015bamp\u0101yana&lt;/a&gt;, and finally the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" as recited by &lt;a href=\"Ugrasrava%20Sauti\"&gt;Ugra\u015brava Sauti&lt;/a&gt; with over 100,000 verses. However, some scholars, such as John Brockington, argue that \"Jaya\" and \"Bharata\" refer to the same text, and ascribe the theory of \"Jaya\" with 8,800 verses to a misreading of a verse in \u0100\"diparvan\" (1.1.81).\nThe &lt;a href=\"redaction\"&gt;redaction&lt;/a&gt; of this large body of text was carried out after formal principles, emphasizing the numbers 18 and 12. The addition of the latest parts may be dated by the absence of the \"Anu\u015b\u0101sana-Parva\" and the \"Vir\u0101ta Parva\" from the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Spitzer%20manuscript\"&gt;Spitzer manuscript&lt;/a&gt;\". The oldest surviving Sanskrit text dates to the Kushan Period (200 CE).\nAccording to what one character says at Mbh. 1.1.50, there were three versions of the epic, beginning with \"Manu\" (1.1.27), \"Astika\" (1.3, sub-Parva 5), or \"Vasu\" (1.57), respectively. These versions would correspond to the addition of one and then another 'frame' settings of dialogues. The \"Vasu\" version would omit the frame settings and begin with the account of the birth of Vyasa. The \"astika\" version would add the \"sarpasattra\" and \"a\u015bvamedha\" material from Brahmanical literature, introduce the name \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\", and identify Vy\u0101sa as the work's author. The redactors of these additions were probably &lt;a href=\"Pa%C3%B1caratra\"&gt;P\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trin&lt;/a&gt; scholars who according to Oberlies (1998) likely retained control over the text until its final redaction. Mention of the &lt;a href=\"Huna%20%28people%29\"&gt;Huna&lt;/a&gt; in the \"Bh\u012b\u1e63ma-Parva\" however appears to imply that this Parva may have been edited around the 4th century.\nThe \u0100di-Parva includes the snake sacrifice (\"sarpasattra\") of &lt;a href=\"Janamejaya%20II\"&gt;Janamejaya&lt;/a&gt;, explaining its motivation, detailing why all snakes in existence were intended to be destroyed, and why despite this, there are still snakes in existence. This \"sarpasattra\" material was often considered an independent tale added to a version of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" by \"thematic attraction\" (Minkowski 1991), and considered to have a particularly close connection to &lt;a href=\"Vedic%20Sanskrit\"&gt;Vedic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Brahmana\"&gt;Brahmana&lt;/a&gt;) literature. The &lt;a href=\"Panchavimsha%20Brahmana\"&gt;Pa\u00f1cavim\u015ba Brahmana&lt;/a&gt; (at 25.15.3) enumerates the officiant priests of a \"sarpasattra\" among whom the names Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63tra and Janamejaya, two main characters of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\"'s \"sarpasattra\", as well as Tak\u1e63aka, the name of a snake in the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\", occur.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Supar%E1%B9%87%C4%81khy%C4%81na\"&gt;Supar\u1e47\u0101khy\u0101na&lt;/a&gt;\", a late Vedic period poem considered to be among the \"earliest traces of epic poetry in India,\" is an older, shorter precursor to the expanded legend of &lt;a href=\"Garuda\"&gt;Garuda&lt;/a&gt; that is included in the \"\u0100st\u012bka Parva\", within the \"\u0100di Parva\" of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\".\nHistorical references.\nThe earliest known references to \"bh\u0101rata\" and the &lt;a href=\"Compound%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;compound&lt;/a&gt; \"mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" date to the \"&lt;a href=\"Ashtadhyayi\"&gt;A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"sutra\"&gt;sutra&lt;/a&gt; 6.2.38) of &lt;a href=\"P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini\"&gt;P\u0101\u1e47ini&lt;/a&gt; (\"fl.\" 4th century BCE) and the \"&lt;a href=\"Grhya%20Sutras\"&gt;A\u015bval\u0101yana G\u1e5bhyas\u016btra&lt;/a&gt;\" (3.4.4). This may mean the core 24,000 verses, known as the \"Bh\u0101rata\", as well as an early version of the extended \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\", were composed by the 4th century BCE. However, it is not certain whether P\u0101\u1e47ini referred to the epic, as \"bh\u0101rata\" was also used to describe other things. &lt;a href=\"Albrecht%20Weber\"&gt;Albrecht Weber&lt;/a&gt; mentions the &lt;a href=\"Rigveda\"&gt;Rigvedic&lt;/a&gt; tribe of the &lt;a href=\"Bharatas%20%28tribe%29\"&gt;Bharatas&lt;/a&gt;, where a great person might have been designated as \"Mah\u0101-Bh\u0101rata\". However, as P\u00e1\u1e47ini also mentions characters that play a role in the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\", some parts of the epic may have already been known in his day. Another aspect is that P\u0101\u1e47ini determined the &lt;a href=\"Pitch-accent%20language\"&gt;accent&lt;/a&gt; of \"mah\u0101-bh\u0101rata\". However, the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" was not recited in &lt;a href=\"Vedic%20accent\"&gt;Vedic accent&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Greek writer &lt;a href=\"Dio%20Chrysostom\"&gt;Dio Chrysostom&lt;/a&gt; (c. 40 \u2013 c. 120 CE) reported that &lt;a href=\"Homer\"&gt;Homer&lt;/a&gt;'s poetry was being sung even in India. Many scholars have taken this as evidence for the existence of a \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" at this date, whose episodes Dio or his sources identify with the story of the \"Iliad\".\nSeveral stories within the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" took on separate identities of their own in &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Sanskrit%20literature\"&gt;Classical Sanskrit literature&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Abhij%C3%B1%C4%81na%C5%9B%C4%81kuntalam\"&gt;Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntala&lt;/a&gt; by the renowned Sanskrit poet &lt;a href=\"K%C4%81lid%C4%81sa\"&gt;K\u0101lid\u0101sa&lt;/a&gt; (c. 400 CE), believed to have lived in the era of the &lt;a href=\"Gupta%20Empire\"&gt;Gupta&lt;/a&gt; dynasty, is based on a story that is the precursor to the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\". &lt;a href=\"Urubhanga\"&gt;Urubha\u1e45ga&lt;/a&gt;, a Sanskrit play written by &lt;a href=\"Bh%C4%81sa\"&gt;Bh\u0101sa&lt;/a&gt; who is believed to have lived before K\u0101lid\u0101sa, is based on the slaying of Duryodhana by the splitting of his thighs by Bh\u012bma.\nThe copper-plate inscription of the &lt;a href=\"Maharaja\"&gt;Maharaja&lt;/a&gt; Sharvanatha (533\u2013534 CE) from Khoh (&lt;a href=\"Satna\"&gt;Satna&lt;/a&gt; District, &lt;a href=\"Madhya%20Pradesh\"&gt;Madhya Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;) describes the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" as a \"collection of 100,000 verses\" (\"\u015bata-sahasri sa\u1e43hit\u0101\").\nThe 18 parvas or books.\nThe Mahabharata begins with the following hymn and in fact this praise has been made at the beginning of every Parva:\n\"Om! Having bowed down to &lt;a href=\"Narayana\"&gt;Narayana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nara%20%28Arjuna%29\"&gt;Nara (Arjuna)&lt;/a&gt;, the most exalted male being, and also to the goddess &lt;a href=\"Saraswati\"&gt;Saraswati&lt;/a&gt;, must the word Jaya be uttered.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Nara-Narayana\"&gt;Nara-Narayana&lt;/a&gt; were two ancient sages who were the portion of Shree &lt;a href=\"Vishnu\"&gt;Vishnu&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nara-Narayana%23Etymology\"&gt;Nara&lt;/a&gt; was the previous birth of &lt;a href=\"Arjuna\"&gt;Arjuna&lt;/a&gt; and the friend of &lt;a href=\"Narayana\"&gt;Narayana&lt;/a&gt;, while Narayana was the incarnation of Shree &lt;a href=\"Vishnu\"&gt;Vishnu&lt;/a&gt; and thus the previous birth of Shree &lt;a href=\"Krishna\"&gt;Krishna&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe division into 18 parvas is as follows:\nHistorical context.\nThe historicity of the &lt;a href=\"Kurukshetra%20War\"&gt;Kurukshetra War&lt;/a&gt; is unclear. Many historians estimate the date of the Kurukshetra war to &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Age%20India\"&gt;Iron Age India&lt;/a&gt; of the 10th century BCE. The setting of the epic has a historical precedent in Iron Age (&lt;a href=\"Vedic%20India\"&gt;Vedic&lt;/a&gt;) India, where the &lt;a href=\"Kuru%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kuru&lt;/a&gt; kingdom was the center of political power during roughly 1200 to 800\u00a0 BCE. A dynastic conflict of the period could have been the inspiration for the \"Jaya\", the foundation on which the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" corpus was built, with a climactic battle, eventually coming to be viewed as an epochal event.\n&lt;a href=\"Puranas\"&gt;Puranic literature&lt;/a&gt; presents genealogical lists associated with the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" narrative. The evidence of the Puranas is of two kinds. Of the first kind, there is the direct statement that there were 1015 (or 1050) years between the birth of &lt;a href=\"Parikshit\"&gt;Parikshit&lt;/a&gt; (Arjuna's grandson) and the accession of &lt;a href=\"Mahapadma%20Nanda\"&gt;Mahapadma Nanda&lt;/a&gt; (400-329\u00a0 BCE), which would yield an estimate of about 1400\u00a0 BCE for the Bharata battle. However, this would imply improbably long reigns on average for the kings listed in the genealogies.\nOf the second kind is analyses of parallel genealogies in the Puranas between the times of Adhisimakrishna (&lt;a href=\"Parikshit\"&gt;Parikshit&lt;/a&gt;'s great-grandson) and &lt;a href=\"Mahapadma%20Nanda\"&gt;Mahapadma Nanda&lt;/a&gt;. Pargiter accordingly estimated 26 generations by averaging 10 different dynastic lists and, assuming 18 years for the average duration of a reign, arrived at an estimate of 850\u00a0 BCE for Adhisimakrishna, and thus approximately 950\u00a0 BCE for the Bharata battle.\n&lt;a href=\"B.%20B.%20Lal\"&gt;B. B. Lal&lt;/a&gt; used the same approach with a more conservative assumption of the average reign to estimate a date of 836 BCE, and correlated this with archaeological evidence from &lt;a href=\"Painted%20Grey%20Ware\"&gt;Painted Grey Ware&lt;/a&gt; (PGW) sites, the association being strong between PGW artifacts and places mentioned in the epic. &lt;a href=\"John%20Keay\"&gt;John Keay&lt;/a&gt; confirms this and also gives 950 BCE for the Bharata battle.\nAttempts to date the events using methods of &lt;a href=\"archaeoastronomy\"&gt;archaeoastronomy&lt;/a&gt; have produced, depending on which passages are chosen and how they are interpreted, estimates ranging from the late 4th to the mid-2nd millennium BCE. The late 4th-millennium date has a precedent in the calculation of the \"&lt;a href=\"Kali%20Yuga\"&gt;Kali Yuga&lt;/a&gt;\" epoch, based on planetary conjunctions, by &lt;a href=\"Aryabhata\"&gt;Aryabhata&lt;/a&gt; (6th century). Aryabhata's date of 18 February 3102\u00a0 BCE for \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" war has become widespread in Indian tradition. Some sources mark this as the disappearance of &lt;a href=\"Krishna\"&gt;Krishna&lt;/a&gt; from the Earth. The &lt;a href=\"Aihole%20inscriptions\"&gt;Aihole inscription&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pulikeshi%20II\"&gt;Pulikeshi II&lt;/a&gt;, dated to Saka 556 = 634 CE, claims that 3735 years have elapsed since the Bharata battle, putting the date of \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" war at 3137\u00a0BCE.\nAnother traditional school of astronomers and historians, represented by Vriddha-Garga, &lt;a href=\"Varahamihira\"&gt;Varahamihira&lt;/a&gt; (author of the &lt;a href=\"Brihat-Samhita\"&gt;\"Brhatsamhita\"&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Kalhana\"&gt;Kalhana&lt;/a&gt; (author of the \"&lt;a href=\"Rajatarangini\"&gt;Rajatarangini&lt;/a&gt;\"), place the Bharata war 653 years after the \"Kali Yuga\" epoch, corresponding to 2449\u00a0BCE.\nSynopsis.\nThe core story of the work is that of a dynastic struggle for the throne of &lt;a href=\"Hastinapura\"&gt;Hastinapura&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Kuru%20%28India%29\"&gt;Kuru&lt;/a&gt; clan. The two collateral branches of the family that participate in the struggle are the &lt;a href=\"Kaurava\"&gt;Kaurava&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pandava\"&gt;Pandava&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Kaurava is the senior branch of the family, &lt;a href=\"Duryodhana\"&gt;Duryodhana&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest Kaurava, is younger than &lt;a href=\"Yudhishthira\"&gt;Yudhishthira&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest Pandava. Both Duryodhana and Yudhishthira claim to be first in line to inherit the throne.\nThe struggle culminates in the &lt;a href=\"Kurukshetra%20War\"&gt;great battle of Kurukshetra&lt;/a&gt;, in which the &lt;a href=\"Pandavas\"&gt;Pandavas&lt;/a&gt; are ultimately victorious. The battle produces complex conflicts of kinship and friendship, instances of family loyalty and duty taking precedence over what is right, as well as the converse.\nThe \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" itself ends with the death of &lt;a href=\"Krishna\"&gt;Krishna&lt;/a&gt;, and the subsequent end of his dynasty and ascent of the Pandava brothers to heaven. It also marks the beginning of the Hindu age of \"&lt;a href=\"Kali%20Yuga\"&gt;Kali Yuga&lt;/a&gt;\", the fourth and final age of humankind, in which great values and noble ideas have crumbled, and people are heading towards the complete dissolution of right action, morality, and virtue.\nThe older generations.\nKing Janamejaya's ancestor &lt;a href=\"Shantanu\"&gt;Shantanu&lt;/a&gt;, the king of &lt;a href=\"Hastinapura\"&gt;Hastinapura&lt;/a&gt;, has a short-lived marriage with the goddess &lt;a href=\"Ganga%20%28goddess%29\"&gt;Ganga&lt;/a&gt; and has a son, Devavrata (later to be called &lt;a href=\"Bhishma\"&gt;Bhishma&lt;/a&gt;, a great warrior), who becomes the heir apparent. Many years later, when King Shantanu goes hunting, he sees &lt;a href=\"Satyavati\"&gt;Satyavati&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of the chief of fisherman, and asks her father for her hand. Her father refuses to consent to the marriage unless Shantanu promises to make any future son of Satyavati the king upon his death. To resolve his father's dilemma, Devavrata agrees to relinquish his right to the throne. As the fisherman is not sure about the prince's children honoring the promise, Devavrata also takes a vow of lifelong celibacy to guarantee his father's promise.\nShantanu has two sons by Satyavati, &lt;a href=\"Chitr%C4%81ngada\"&gt;Chitr\u0101ngada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vichitravirya\"&gt;Vichitravirya&lt;/a&gt;. Upon Shantanu's death, Chitrangada becomes king. He lives a very short uneventful life and dies. Vichitravirya, the younger son, rules &lt;a href=\"Hastinapura\"&gt;Hastinapura&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the King of &lt;a href=\"K%C4%81%C5%9B%C4%AB\"&gt;K\u0101\u015b\u012b&lt;/a&gt; arranges a &lt;a href=\"swayamvara\"&gt;swayamvara&lt;/a&gt; for his three daughters, neglecting to invite the royal family of Hastinapur. To arrange the marriage of young Vichitravirya, Bhishma attends the swayamvara of the three princesses &lt;a href=\"Amba%20%28Mahabharata%29\"&gt;Amba&lt;/a&gt;, Ambika, and &lt;a href=\"Ambalika\"&gt;Ambalika&lt;/a&gt;, uninvited, and proceeds to abduct them. Ambika and Ambalika consent to be married to Vichitravirya.\nThe oldest princess Amba, however, informs Bhishma that she wishes to marry the king of Shalva whom Bhishma defeated at their swayamvara. Bhishma lets her leave to marry the king of Shalva, but Shalva refuses to marry her, still smarting at his humiliation at the hands of Bhishma. Amba then returns to marry Bhishma but he refuses due to his vow of celibacy. Amba becomes enraged and becomes Bhishma's bitter enemy, holding him responsible for her plight. Later she is reborn to King &lt;a href=\"Drupada\"&gt;Drupada&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Shikhandi\"&gt;Shikhandi&lt;/a&gt; (or Shikhandini) and causes Bhishma's fall, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Arjuna\"&gt;Arjuna&lt;/a&gt;, in the battle of Kurukshetra.\nThe Pandava and Kaurava princes.\nWhen Vichitravirya dies young without any heirs, Satyavati asks her first son &lt;a href=\"Vyasa\"&gt;Vyasa&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"niyoga\"&gt;father children with&lt;/a&gt; the widows. The eldest, Ambika, shuts her eyes when she sees him, and so her son &lt;a href=\"Dhritarashtra\"&gt;Dhritarashtra&lt;/a&gt; is born blind. Ambalika turns pale and bloodless upon seeing him, and thus her son &lt;a href=\"Pandu\"&gt;Pandu&lt;/a&gt; is born pale and unhealthy (the term Pandu may also mean 'jaundiced'). Due to the physical challenges of the first two children, Satyavati asks Vyasa to try once again. However, Ambika and Ambalika send their maid instead, to Vyasa's room. Vyasa fathers a third son, &lt;a href=\"Vidura\"&gt;Vidura&lt;/a&gt;, by the maid. He is born healthy and grows up to be one of the wisest characters in the \"Mahabharata\". He serves as Prime Minister (Mahamantri or Mahatma) to King Pandu and King Dhritarashtra.\nWhen the princes grow up, Dhritarashtra is about to be crowned king by Bhishma when Vidura intervenes and uses his knowledge of politics to assert that a blind person cannot be king. This is because a blind man cannot control and protect his subjects. The throne is then given to Pandu because of Dhritarashtra's blindness. Pandu marries twice, to &lt;a href=\"Kunti\"&gt;Kunti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Madri\"&gt;Madri&lt;/a&gt;. Dhritarashtra marries &lt;a href=\"Gandhari%20%28Mahabharata%29\"&gt;Gandhari&lt;/a&gt;, a princess from Gandhara, who blindfolds herself for the rest of her life so that she may feel the pain that her husband feels. Her brother &lt;a href=\"Shakuni\"&gt;Shakuni&lt;/a&gt; is enraged by this and vows to take revenge on the Kuru family. One day, when Pandu is relaxing in the forest, he hears the sound of a wild animal. He shoots an arrow in the direction of the sound. However, the arrow hits the sage &lt;a href=\"Kindama\"&gt;Kindama&lt;/a&gt;, who was engaged in a sexual act in the guise of a deer. He curses Pandu that if he engages in a sexual act, he will die. Pandu then retires to the forest along with his two wives, and his brother Dhritarashtra rules thereafter, despite his blindness.\nPandu's older queen Kunti, however, had been given a boon by Sage &lt;a href=\"Durvasa\"&gt;Durvasa&lt;/a&gt; that she could invoke any god using a special mantra. Kunti uses this boon to ask &lt;a href=\"Dharma\"&gt;Dharma&lt;/a&gt; the god of justice, &lt;a href=\"Vayu\"&gt;Vayu&lt;/a&gt; the god of the wind, and &lt;a href=\"Indra\"&gt;Indra&lt;/a&gt; the lord of the heavens for sons. She gives birth to three sons, &lt;a href=\"Yudhishthira\"&gt;Yudhishthira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bhima\"&gt;Bhima&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arjuna\"&gt;Arjuna&lt;/a&gt;, through these gods. Kunti shares her mantra with the younger queen &lt;a href=\"Madri\"&gt;Madri&lt;/a&gt;, who bears the twins &lt;a href=\"Nakula\"&gt;Nakula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sahadeva\"&gt;Sahadeva&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Ashvins\"&gt;Ashwini&lt;/a&gt; twins. However, Pandu and Madri indulge in lovemaking, and Pandu dies. Madri commits suicide out of remorse. Kunti raises the five brothers, who are from then on usually referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Pandava\"&gt;Pandava&lt;/a&gt; brothers.\nDhritarashtra has a hundred sons through &lt;a href=\"Gandhari%20%28Mahabharata%29\"&gt;Gandhari&lt;/a&gt;, all born after the birth of Yudhishthira. These are the &lt;a href=\"Kaurava\"&gt;Kaurava&lt;/a&gt; brothers, the eldest being &lt;a href=\"Duryodhana\"&gt;Duryodhana&lt;/a&gt;, and the second &lt;a href=\"Dushasana\"&gt;Dushasana&lt;/a&gt;. Other Kaurava brothers were &lt;a href=\"Vikarna\"&gt;Vikarna&lt;/a&gt; and Sukarna. The rivalry and enmity between them and the Pandava brothers, from their youth and into manhood, leads to the &lt;a href=\"Kurukshetra\"&gt;Kurukshetra&lt;/a&gt; war.\nLakshagraha (the house of lac).\nAfter the deaths of their mother (Madri) and father (Pandu), the Pandavas and their mother Kunti return to the palace of Hastinapur. Yudhishthira is made Crown Prince by Dhritarashtra, under considerable pressure from his courtiers. Dhritarashtra wanted his son Duryodhana to become king and lets his ambition get in the way of preserving justice.\nShakuni, Duryodhana, and Dushasana plot to get rid of the Pandavas. Shakuni calls the architect &lt;a href=\"Purochana\"&gt;Purochana&lt;/a&gt; to build a palace out of flammable materials like lac and ghee. He then arranges for the Pandavas and the Queen Mother Kunti to stay there, intending to set it alight. However, the Pandavas are warned by their wise uncle, &lt;a href=\"Vidura\"&gt;Vidura&lt;/a&gt;, who sends them a miner to dig a tunnel. They can escape to safety and go into hiding. During this time Bhima marries a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ess &lt;a href=\"Hidimbi\"&gt;Hidimbi&lt;/a&gt; and has a son Ghatotkacha. Back in Hastinapur, the Pandavas and Kunti are presumed dead.\nMarriage to Draupadi.\nWhilst they were in hiding the Pandavas learn of a &lt;a href=\"swayamvara\"&gt;swayamvara&lt;/a&gt; which is taking place for the hand of the &lt;a href=\"P%C4%81%C3%B1c%C4%81la\"&gt;P\u0101\u00f1c\u0101la&lt;/a&gt; princess &lt;a href=\"Draupad%C4%AB\"&gt;Draupad\u012b&lt;/a&gt;. The Pandavas disguised as &lt;a href=\"Brahmin\"&gt;Brahmin&lt;/a&gt;s come to witness the event. Meanwhile, Krishna who has already befriended Draupadi, tells her to look out for Arjuna (though now believed to be dead). The task was to string a mighty steel bow and shoot a target on the ceiling, which was the eye of a moving artificial fish while looking at its reflection in oil below. In popular versions, after all the princes fail, many being unable to lift the bow, Karna proceeds to the attempt but is interrupted by Draupadi who refuses to marry a suta (this has been excised from the Critical Edition of Mahabharata as later interpolation). After this the swayamvara is opened to the Brahmins leading Arjuna to win the contest and marry Draupadi. The Pandavas return home and inform their meditating mother that Arjuna has won a competition and to look at what they have brought back. Without looking, Kunti asks them to share whatever Arjuna has won amongst themselves, thinking it to be &lt;a href=\"alms\"&gt;alms&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Draupadi ends up being the &lt;a href=\"Fraternal%20polyandry\"&gt;wife of all five brothers&lt;/a&gt;.\nIndraprastha.\nAfter the wedding, the Pandava brothers are invited back to Hastinapura. The Kuru family elders and relatives negotiate and broker a split of the kingdom, with the Pandavas obtaining and demanding only a wild forest inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Takshaka\"&gt;Takshaka&lt;/a&gt;, the king of snakes, and his family. Through hard work, the Pandavas can build a new glorious capital for the territory at &lt;a href=\"Indraprastha\"&gt;Indraprastha&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after this, Arjuna elopes with and then marries Krishna's sister, &lt;a href=\"Subhadra\"&gt;Subhadra&lt;/a&gt;. Yudhishthira wishes to establish his position as king; he seeks Krishna's advice. Krishna advises him, and after due preparation and the elimination of some opposition, Yudhishthira carries out the \"r\u0101jas\u016bya yagna\" ceremony; he is thus recognized as pre-eminent among kings.\nThe Pandavas have a new palace built for them, by &lt;a href=\"Mayasura\"&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Danava%20%28Hinduism%29\"&gt;Danava&lt;/a&gt;. They invite their Kaurava cousins to Indraprastha. Duryodhana walks round the palace, and mistakes a glossy floor for water, and will not step in. After being told of his error, he then sees a pond and assumes it is not water and falls in. &lt;a href=\"Bhima\"&gt;Bhima&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arjuna\"&gt;Arjun&lt;/a&gt;, the twins and the servants laugh at him. In popular adaptations, this insult is wrongly attributed to Draupadi, even though in the Sanskrit epic, it was the Pandavas (except Yudhishthira) who had insulted Duryodhana. Enraged by the insult, and jealous at seeing the wealth of the Pandavas, Duryodhana decides to host a dice-game at Shakuni's suggestion.\nThe dice game.\nShakuni, Duryodhana's uncle, now arranges a dice game, playing against Yudhishthira with loaded dice. In the dice game, Yudhishthira loses all his wealth, then his kingdom. Yudhishthira then gambles his brothers, himself, and finally his wife into servitude. The jubilant Kauravas insult the Pandavas in their helpless state and even try to disrobe Draupadi in front of the entire court, but Draupadi's disrobe is prevented by Krishna, who miraculously make her dress endless, therefore it couldn't be removed.\nDhritarashtra, Bhishma, and the other elders are aghast at the situation, but Duryodhana is adamant that there is no place for two crown princes in Hastinapura. Against his wishes Dhritarashtra orders for another dice game. The Pandavas are required to go into exile for 12 years, and in the 13th year, they must remain hidden. If they are discovered by the Kauravas in the 13th year of their exile, then they will be forced into exile for another 12 years.\nExile and return.\nThe Pandavas spend thirteen years in exile; many adventures occur during this time. The Pandavas acquire many divine weapons, given by gods, during this period. They also prepare alliances for a possible future conflict. They spend their final year in disguise in the court of the king &lt;a href=\"Virata\"&gt;Virata&lt;/a&gt;, and they are discovered just after the end of the year.\nAt the end of their exile, they try to negotiate a return to Indraprastha with Krishna as their emissary. However, this negotiation fails, because Duryodhana objected that they were discovered in the 13th year of their exile and the return of their kingdom was not agreed upon. Then the Pandavas fought the Kauravas, claiming their rights over Indraprastha.\nThe battle at Kurukshetra.\nThe two sides summon vast armies to their help and line up at &lt;a href=\"Kurukshetra\"&gt;Kurukshetra&lt;/a&gt; for a war. The kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Panchala\"&gt;Panchala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dv%C4%81rak%C4%81\"&gt;Dwaraka&lt;/a&gt;, Kasi, &lt;a href=\"Kekaya\"&gt;Kekaya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magadha\"&gt;Magadha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Matsya\"&gt;Matsya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chedi%20Kingdom\"&gt;Chedi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandya%20dynasty\"&gt;Pandyas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Telinga\"&gt;Telinga&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Yadu\"&gt;Yadu&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Mathura%2C%20Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;Mathura&lt;/a&gt; and some other clans like the &lt;a href=\"Parama%20Kambojas\"&gt;Parama Kambojas&lt;/a&gt; were allied with the &lt;a href=\"Pandava\"&gt;Pandava&lt;/a&gt;s. The allies of the &lt;a href=\"Kaurava\"&gt;Kaurava&lt;/a&gt;s included the kings of Pragjyotisha, &lt;a href=\"Anga\"&gt;Anga&lt;/a&gt;, Kekaya, Sindhudesa (including Sindhus, &lt;a href=\"Sovira\"&gt;Sauviras&lt;/a&gt; and Sivis), Mahishmati, &lt;a href=\"Avanti%20%28India%29\"&gt;Avanti&lt;/a&gt; in Madhyadesa, &lt;a href=\"Madra\"&gt;Madra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gandhara\"&gt;Gandhara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bahlika%20people\"&gt;Bahlika people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kambojas\"&gt;Kambojas&lt;/a&gt; and many others. Before war being declared, &lt;a href=\"Balarama\"&gt;Balarama&lt;/a&gt; had expressed his unhappiness at the developing conflict and leaves to go on &lt;a href=\"pilgrimage\"&gt;pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt;; thus he does not take part in the battle itself. Krishna takes part in a non-combatant role, as charioteer (&lt;a href=\"Sarathy\"&gt;Sarathy&lt;/a&gt;) for &lt;a href=\"Arjuna\"&gt;Arjuna&lt;/a&gt; and offers &lt;a href=\"Narayani%20Sena\"&gt;Narayani Sena&lt;/a&gt; consisting of &lt;a href=\"Abhira\"&gt;Abhira&lt;/a&gt; gopas to the &lt;a href=\"Kaurava\"&gt;Kaurava&lt;/a&gt;s to fight on their side.\nBefore the battle, Arjuna, noticing that the opposing army includes his cousins and relatives, including his grandfather &lt;a href=\"Bhishma\"&gt;Bhishma&lt;/a&gt; and his teacher &lt;a href=\"Drona\"&gt;Drona&lt;/a&gt;, has grave doubts about the fight. He falls into despair and refuses to fight. At this time, Krishna reminds him of his duty as a &lt;a href=\"Kshatriya\"&gt;Kshatriya&lt;/a&gt; to fight for a righteous cause in the famous &lt;a href=\"Bhagavad%20Gita\"&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/a&gt; section of the epic.\nThough initially sticking to chivalrous notions of warfare, both sides soon adopt dishonorable tactics. At the end of the 18-day battle, only the Pandavas, &lt;a href=\"Satyaki\"&gt;Satyaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kripa\"&gt;Kripa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashwatthama\"&gt;Ashwatthama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kritavarma\"&gt;Kritavarma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yuyutsu\"&gt;Yuyutsu&lt;/a&gt; and Krishna survive. Yudhisthir becomes King of Hastinapur and Gandhari curses Krishna that the downfall of his clan is imminent.\nThe end of the Pandavas.\nAfter \"seeing\" the carnage, &lt;a href=\"Gandhari%20%28Mahabharata%29\"&gt;Gandhari&lt;/a&gt;, who had lost all her sons, curses Krishna to be a witness to a similar annihilation of his family, for though divine and capable of stopping the war, he had not done so. Krishna accepts the curse, which bears fruit 36 years later.\nThe Pandavas, who had ruled their kingdom meanwhile, decide to renounce everything. Clad in skins and rags they retire to the &lt;a href=\"Himalaya\"&gt;Himalaya&lt;/a&gt; and climb towards heaven in their bodily form. A stray dog travels with them. One by one the brothers and Draupadi fall on their way. As each one stumbles, Yudhishthira gives the rest the reason for their fall (Draupadi was partial to Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva were vain and proud of their looks, and Bhima and Arjuna were proud of their strength and archery skills, respectively). Only the virtuous Yudhishthira, who had tried everything to prevent the carnage, and the dog remain. The dog reveals himself to be the god Yama (also known as Yama Dharmaraja) and then takes him to the underworld where he sees his siblings and wife. After explaining the nature of the test, Yama takes Yudhishthira back to heaven and explains that it was necessary to expose him to the underworld because (Rajyante narakam dhruvam) any ruler has to visit the underworld at least once. Yama then assures him that his siblings and wife would join him in heaven after they had been exposed to the underworld for measures of time according to their vices.\nArjuna's grandson &lt;a href=\"Parikshit\"&gt;Parikshit&lt;/a&gt; rules after them and dies bitten by a snake. His furious son, Janamejaya, decides to perform a snake sacrifice (\"&lt;a href=\"sarpasattra\"&gt;sarpasattra&lt;/a&gt;\") to destroy the snakes. It is at this sacrifice that the tale of his ancestors is narrated to him.\nThe reunion.\nThe \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" mentions that Karna, the Pandavas, Draupadi and Dhritarashtra's sons eventually ascended to &lt;a href=\"svarga\"&gt;svarga&lt;/a&gt; and \"attained the state of the &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;s\", and banded together \u2013 \"serene and free from anger\".\nThemes.\nJust war.\nThe \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" offers one of the first instances of theorizing about \"&lt;a href=\"Dharma-yuddha\"&gt;dharmayuddha&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Just%20war%20theory\"&gt;just war&lt;/a&gt;\", illustrating many of the standards that would be debated later across the world. In the story, one of five brothers asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified. A long discussion ensues between the siblings, establishing criteria like \"proportionality\" (chariots cannot attack cavalry, only other chariots; no attacking people in distress), \"just means\" (no poisoned or barbed arrows), \"just cause\" (no attacking out of rage), and fair treatment of captives and the wounded.\nTranslations, versions and derivative works.\nTranslations.\nA &lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; translation of \"Mahabharata\", titled \"&lt;a href=\"Razmnameh\"&gt;Razmnameh&lt;/a&gt;\", was produced at Akbar's orders, by &lt;a href=\"Faizi\"&gt;Faizi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%CA%BDAbd%20al-Qadir%20Badayuni\"&gt;\u02bdAbd al-Qadir Badayuni&lt;/a&gt; in the 18th century.\nThe first complete English translation was the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20literature\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; prose version by &lt;a href=\"Kisari%20Mohan%20Ganguli\"&gt;Kisari Mohan Ganguli&lt;/a&gt;, published between 1883 and 1896 (Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers) and by M. N. Dutt (&lt;a href=\"Motilal%20Banarsidass\"&gt;Motilal Banarsidass&lt;/a&gt; Publishers). Most critics consider the translation by Ganguli to be faithful to the original text. The complete text of Ganguli's translation is in the &lt;a href=\"public%20domain\"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt; and is available online.\nAn early poetry translation by &lt;a href=\"Romesh%20Chunder%20Dutt\"&gt;Romesh Chunder Dutt&lt;/a&gt; and published in 1898 condenses the main themes of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" into English verse. A later poetic \"transcreation\" (author's description) of the full epic into English, done by the poet &lt;a href=\"Purushottama%20Lal\"&gt;P. Lal&lt;/a&gt;, is complete, and in 2005 began being published by &lt;a href=\"Writers%20Workshop\"&gt;Writers Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, Calcutta. The P. Lal translation is a non-rhyming verse-by-verse rendering, and is the only edition in any language to include all slokas in all recensions of the work (not just those in the \"Critical Edition\"). The completion of the publishing project is scheduled for 2010. Sixteen of the eighteen volumes are now available. Dr. Pradip Bhattacharya stated that the P. Lal version is \"known in academia as the \u2018&lt;a href=\"vulgate\"&gt;vulgate&lt;/a&gt;'\". However, it has been described as \"not strictly speaking a translation\".\nA project to translate the full epic into English prose, translated by various hands, began to appear in 2005 from the &lt;a href=\"Clay%20Sanskrit%20Library\"&gt;Clay Sanskrit Library&lt;/a&gt;, published by &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20University\"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt; Press. The translation is based not on the \"Critical Edition\" but on the version known to the commentator &lt;a href=\"N%C4%ABlaka%E1%B9%87%E1%B9%ADha%20Caturdhara\"&gt;N\u012blaka\u1e47\u1e6dha&lt;/a&gt;. Currently available are 15 volumes of the projected 32-volume edition.\nIndian Vedic &lt;a href=\"Shripad%20Damodar%20Satwalekar\"&gt;Scholar Shripad Damodar Satwalekar&lt;/a&gt; translated the Critical Edition of Mahabharata into Hindi which was assigned to him by the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20India\"&gt;Government of India&lt;/a&gt;. After his death, the task was taken up by Shrutisheel Sharma.\nIndian economist &lt;a href=\"Bibek%20Debroy\"&gt;Bibek Debroy&lt;/a&gt; also wrote an unabridged English translation in ten volumes. Volume 1: Adi Parva was published in March 2010, and the last two volumes were published in December 2014. Abhinav Agarwal referred to Debroy's translation as \"thoroughly enjoyable and impressively scholarly\". In a review of the seventh volume, Bhattacharya stated that the translator bridged gaps in the narrative of the Critical Edition, but also noted translation errors. Gautam Chikermane of \"&lt;a href=\"Hindustan%20Times\"&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote that where \"both Debroy and Ganguli get tiresome is in the use of adjectives while describing protagonists\".\nAnother English prose translation of the full epic, based on the \"Critical Edition\", is in progress, published by &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt; Press. It was initiated by &lt;a href=\"Indologist\"&gt;Indologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"J.%20A.%20B.%20van%20Buitenen\"&gt;J. A. B. van Buitenen&lt;/a&gt; (books 1\u20135) and, following a 20-year hiatus caused by the death of van Buitenen is being continued by several scholars. &lt;a href=\"James%20L.%20Fitzgerald\"&gt;James L. Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; translated book 11 and the first half of book 12. David Gitomer is translating book 6, Gary Tubb is translating book 7, &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Minkowski\"&gt;Christopher Minkowski&lt;/a&gt; is translating book 8, &lt;a href=\"Alf%20Hiltebeitel\"&gt;Alf Hiltebeitel&lt;/a&gt; is translating books 9 and 10, Fitzgerald is translating the second half of book 12, &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Olivelle\"&gt;Patrick Olivelle&lt;/a&gt; is translating book 13, and Fred Smith is translating book 14-18.\nMany condensed versions, abridgments and novelistic prose retellings of the complete epic have been published in English, including works by &lt;a href=\"Ramesh%20Menon\"&gt;Ramesh Menon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Buck%20%28translator%29\"&gt;William Buck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"R.%20K.%20Narayan\"&gt;R.

This is the text that is usually used in current Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata studies for reference. This work is sometimes called the \"Pune\" or \"Poona\" edition of the \"Mahabharata\".\nRegional versions.\nMany regional versions of the work developed over time, mostly differing only in minor details, or with verses or subsidiary stories being added. These include the &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20culture\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt; street theatre, &lt;a href=\"terukkuttu\"&gt;terukkuttu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"kattaikkuttu\"&gt;kattaikkuttu&lt;/a&gt;, the plays of which use themes from the Tamil language versions of \"Mahabharata\", focusing on Draupadi.\nOutside the Indian subcontinent, in &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, a version was developed in ancient &lt;a href=\"Java\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Kakawin%20Bh%C4%81ratayuddha\"&gt;Kakawin Bh\u0101ratayuddha&lt;/a&gt; in the 11th century under the patronage of King &lt;a href=\"Dharmawangsa\"&gt;Dharmawangsa&lt;/a&gt; (990\u20131016) and later it spread to the neighboring island of &lt;a href=\"Bali\"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, which remains a Hindu majority island today. It has become the fertile source for Javanese literature, dance drama (&lt;a href=\"wayang%20wong\"&gt;wayang wong&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"wayang\"&gt;wayang&lt;/a&gt; shadow puppet performances. This Javanese version of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" differs slightly from the original Indian version. Another notable difference is the inclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Punakawan\"&gt;Punakawan&lt;/a&gt;s, the clown servants of the main characters in the storyline. These characters include &lt;a href=\"Semar\"&gt;Semar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Petruk\"&gt;Petruk&lt;/a&gt;, Gareng, and Bagong, who are much-loved by Indonesian audiences. There are also some spin-off episodes developed in ancient Java, such as &lt;a href=\"Arjunawiwaha\"&gt;Arjunawiwaha&lt;/a&gt; composed in the 11th century.\nA &lt;a href=\"Kawi%20language\"&gt;Kawi&lt;/a&gt; version of the \"Mahabharata\", of which eight of the eighteen \"parvas\" survive, is found on the Indonesian island of &lt;a href=\"Bali\"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;. It has been translated into English by Dr. &lt;a href=\"I.%20Gusti%20Putu%20Phalgunadi\"&gt;I. Gusti Putu Phalgunadi&lt;/a&gt;.\nDerivative literature.\n&lt;a href=\"Bhasa\"&gt;Bhasa&lt;/a&gt;, the 2nd- or 3rd-century CE Sanskrit playwright, wrote two plays on episodes in the \"Marabharata\", \"&lt;a href=\"Urubhanga\"&gt;Urubhanga&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Broken Thigh\"), about the fight between &lt;a href=\"Duryodhana\"&gt;Duryodhana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bhima\"&gt;Bhima&lt;/a&gt;, while \"&lt;a href=\"Madhyamavyayoga\"&gt;Madhyamavyayoga&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Middle One\") set around Bhima and his son, &lt;a href=\"Ghatotkacha\"&gt;Ghatotkacha&lt;/a&gt;. The first important play of 20th century was \"&lt;a href=\"Andha%20Yug\"&gt;Andha Yug&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Blind Epoch\"), by &lt;a href=\"Dharamvir%20Bharati\"&gt;Dharamvir Bharati&lt;/a&gt;, which came in 1955, found in \"Mahabharat\", both an ideal source and expression of modern predicaments and discontent. Starting with &lt;a href=\"Ebrahim%20Alkazi\"&gt;Ebrahim Alkazi&lt;/a&gt;, it was staged by numerous directors. &lt;a href=\"V.%20S.%20Khandekar\"&gt;V. S. Khandekar&lt;/a&gt;'s Marathi novel, \"Yayati\" (1960), and &lt;a href=\"Girish%20Karnad\"&gt;Girish Karnad&lt;/a&gt;'s debut play \"Yayati\" (1961) are based on the story of King &lt;a href=\"Yayati\"&gt;Yayati&lt;/a&gt; found in the \"Mahabharat\". Bengali writer and playwright, &lt;a href=\"Buddhadeva%20Bose\"&gt;Buddhadeva Bose&lt;/a&gt; wrote three plays set in Mahabharat, \"Anamni Angana\", \"Pratham Partha\" and \"Kalsandhya\". &lt;a href=\"Pratibha%20Ray\"&gt;Pratibha Ray&lt;/a&gt; wrote an &lt;a href=\"Moortidevi%20Award\"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; winning novel entitled &lt;a href=\"Yajnaseni%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Yajnaseni&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Draupadi\"&gt;Draupadi&lt;/a&gt;'s perspective in 1984. Later, &lt;a href=\"Chitra%20Banerjee%20Divakaruni\"&gt;Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni&lt;/a&gt; wrote a similar novel entitled \"\" in 2008. Gujarati poet &lt;a href=\"Chinu%20Modi\"&gt;Chinu Modi&lt;/a&gt; has written long narrative poetry \"&lt;a href=\"Bahuk\"&gt;Bahuk&lt;/a&gt;\" based on character &lt;a href=\"Bahuka%20%28Nala%29\"&gt;Bahuka&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Krishna%20Udayasankar\"&gt;Krishna Udayasankar&lt;/a&gt;, a Singapore-based Indian author, has written several novels which are modern-day retellings of the epic, most notably the Aryavarta Chronicles Series. &lt;a href=\"Suman%20Pokhrel\"&gt;Suman Pokhrel&lt;/a&gt; wrote a &lt;a href=\"Yajnaseni%20%28play%29\"&gt;solo play&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href=\"Yajnaseni%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Ray's novel&lt;/a&gt; by personalizing and taking &lt;a href=\"Draupadi\"&gt;Draupadi&lt;/a&gt; alone in the scene.\n&lt;a href=\"Amar%20Chitra%20Katha\"&gt;Amar Chitra Katha&lt;/a&gt; published a 1,260-page &lt;a href=\"Mahabharata%20%28comics%29\"&gt;comic book version of the \"Mahabharata\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn film and television.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cinema%20of%20India\"&gt;Indian cinema&lt;/a&gt;, several film versions of the epic have been made, dating back to 1920. The \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" was also reinterpreted by &lt;a href=\"Shyam%20Benegal\"&gt;Shyam Benegal&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Kalyug%20%281980%20film%29\"&gt;Kalyug&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Prakash%20Jha\"&gt;Prakash Jha&lt;/a&gt; directed 2010 film &lt;a href=\"Raajneeti\"&gt;Raajneeti&lt;/a&gt; was partially inspired by the \"Mahabharata\". A &lt;a href=\"Mahabharat%20%282013%20film%29\"&gt;2013 animated adaptation&lt;/a&gt; holds the record for India's most expensive animated film.\nIn 1988, &lt;a href=\"B.%20R.%20Chopra\"&gt;B. R. Chopra&lt;/a&gt; created a television series named \"&lt;a href=\"Mahabharat%20%281988%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Mahabharat&lt;/a&gt;.\" It was directed by &lt;a href=\"Ravi%20Chopra\"&gt;Ravi Chopra&lt;/a&gt;, and was televised on India's national television (&lt;a href=\"Doordarshan\"&gt;Doordarshan&lt;/a&gt;). The same year as \"Mahabharat\" was being shown on Doordarshan, that same company's other television show, \"&lt;a href=\"Bharat%20Ek%20Khoj\"&gt;Bharat Ek Khoj&lt;/a&gt;\", also directed by Shyam Benegal, showed a 2-episode abbreviation of the \"Mahabharata\", drawing from various interpretations of the work, be they sung, danced, or staged. In the &lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;Western world&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known presentation of the epic is &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Brook\"&gt;Peter Brook&lt;/a&gt;'s nine-hour play, which premiered in &lt;a href=\"Avignon\"&gt;Avignon&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, and its five-hour movie version &lt;a href=\"The%20Mahabharata%20%281989%20film%29\"&gt;\" The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\"&lt;/a&gt; (1989). In the late 2013 \"&lt;a href=\"Mahabharat%20%282013%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Mahabharat&lt;/a&gt;\" was televised on STAR Plus. It was produced by Swastik Productions Pvt.\nUncompleted projects on the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" include one by &lt;a href=\"Rajkumar%20Santoshi\"&gt;Rajkumar Santoshi&lt;/a&gt;, and a theatrical adaptation planned by &lt;a href=\"Satyajit%20Ray\"&gt;Satyajit Ray&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn folk culture.\nEvery year in the &lt;a href=\"Garhwal%20division\"&gt;Garhwal region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Uttarakhand\"&gt;Uttarakhand&lt;/a&gt;, villagers perform the \"&lt;a href=\"Pandav%20Lila\"&gt;Pandav Lila&lt;/a&gt;\", a ritual re-enactment of episodes from the \"Mahabharata\" through dancing, singing, and recitation. The \"lila\" is a cultural highlight of the year and is usually performed between November and February. Folk instruments of the region, &lt;a href=\"dhol\"&gt;dhol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"damau\"&gt;damau&lt;/a&gt; and two long trumpets &lt;a href=\"bhankore\"&gt;bhankore&lt;/a&gt;, accompany the action. The actors, who are amateurs not pr, professionals, often break into a spontaneous dance when they are \"possessed\" by the spirits of their characters.\nJain version.\n&lt;a href=\"Jainism\"&gt;Jain&lt;/a&gt; versions of \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" can be found in the various &lt;a href=\"Jain%20texts\"&gt;Jain texts&lt;/a&gt; like \"&lt;a href=\"Harivamsapurana\"&gt;Harivamsapurana&lt;/a&gt;\" (the story of &lt;a href=\"Harivamsa\"&gt;Harivamsa&lt;/a&gt;) \"Trisastisalakapurusa Caritra\" (Hagiography of 63 Illustrious persons), \"Pandavacharitra\" (lives of &lt;a href=\"Pandava\"&gt;Pandava&lt;/a&gt;s) and \"Pandavapurana\" (stories of &lt;a href=\"Pandava\"&gt;Pandava&lt;/a&gt;s). From the earlier canonical literature, \"Antakrddaa\u015b\u0101h\" (8th cannon) and \"Vrisnidasa\" (\"upangagama\" or secondary canon) contain the stories of &lt;a href=\"Neminatha\"&gt;Neminatha&lt;/a&gt; (22nd &lt;a href=\"Tirthankara\"&gt;Tirthankara&lt;/a&gt;), Krishna and Balarama. Prof. &lt;a href=\"Padmanabh%20Jaini\"&gt;Padmanabh Jaini&lt;/a&gt; notes that, unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names Baladeva and Vasudeva are not restricted to Balarama and Krishna in Jain Puranas. Instead, they serve as names of two distinct classes of mighty brothers, who appear nine times in each half of time cycles of the &lt;a href=\"Jain%20cosmology\"&gt;Jain cosmology&lt;/a&gt; and rule half the earth as half-chakravartins. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the Jinacharitra by &lt;a href=\"Bhadrabahu\"&gt;Bhadrabahu&lt;/a&gt; swami (4th\u20133rd century BCE). According to &lt;a href=\"Jain%20cosmology\"&gt;Jain cosmology&lt;/a&gt; Balarama, Krishna and Jarasandha are the ninth and the last set of Baladeva, Vasudeva, and Prativasudeva. The main battle is not the Mahabharata, but the fight between Krishna and Jarasandha (who is killed by Krishna as Prativasudevas are killed by Vasudevas). Ultimately, the Pandavas and Balarama take renunciation as &lt;a href=\"Jain%20monk\"&gt;Jain monk&lt;/a&gt;s and are reborn in heavens, while on the other hand Krishna and Jarasandha are reborn in hell. In keeping with the &lt;a href=\"Karma%20in%20Jainism\"&gt;law of karma&lt;/a&gt;, Krishna is reborn in hell for his exploits (sexual and violent) while Jarasandha for his evil ways. Prof. Jaini admits a possibility that perhaps because of his popularity, the Jain authors were keen to rehabilitate Krishna. The Jain texts predict that after his karmic term in the hell is over sometime during the next half time-cycle, Krishna will be reborn as a Jain &lt;a href=\"Tirthankara\"&gt;Tirthankara&lt;/a&gt; and attain &lt;a href=\"Moksa%20%28Jainism%29\"&gt;liberation&lt;/a&gt;. Krishna and Balrama are shown as contemporaries and cousins of 22nd Tirthankara, Neminatha. According to this story, Krishna arranged young Neminath's marriage with Rajemati, the daughter of Ugrasena, but Neminatha, empathizing with the animals which were to be slaughtered for the marriage feast, left the procession suddenly and renounced the world.\nCultural influence.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Bhagavad%20Gita\"&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/a&gt;\", Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a warrior and prince and elaborates on different &lt;a href=\"Yoga\"&gt;Yogic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vedantic\"&gt;Vedantic&lt;/a&gt; philosophies, with examples and analogies. This has led to the \"Gita\" often being described as a concise guide to &lt;a href=\"Hindu%20philosophy\"&gt;Hindu philosophy&lt;/a&gt; and a practical, self-contained guide to life. In more modern times, &lt;a href=\"Swami%20Vivekananda\"&gt;Swami Vivekananda&lt;/a&gt;, Netaji &lt;a href=\"Subhas%20Chandra%20Bose\"&gt;Subhas Chandra Bose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Gangadhar%20Tilak\"&gt;Bal Gangadhar Tilak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mahatma%20Gandhi\"&gt;Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; and many others used the text to help inspire the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20independence%20movement\"&gt;Indian independence movement&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has also inspired several works of modern Hindi literature, such as &lt;a href=\"Ramdhari%20Singh%20Dinkar\"&gt;Ramdhari Singh Dinkar&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Rashmirathi\"&gt;Rashmirathi&lt;/a&gt;\", which is a rendition of \"Mahabharata\" centered around &lt;a href=\"Karna\"&gt;Karna&lt;/a&gt; and his conflicts. It was written in 1952, and won the prestigious &lt;a href=\"Jnanpith%20Award\"&gt;Jnanpith Award&lt;/a&gt; in 1972."
