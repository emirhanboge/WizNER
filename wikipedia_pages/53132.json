    "text": "Humanities are &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20academic%20disciplines\"&gt;academic disciplines&lt;/a&gt; that study aspects of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"culture\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, the term contrasted with &lt;a href=\"Divinity%20%28academic%20discipline%29\"&gt;divinity&lt;/a&gt; and referred to what is now called &lt;a href=\"classics\"&gt;classics&lt;/a&gt;, the main area of &lt;a href=\"secular\"&gt;secular&lt;/a&gt; study in universities at the time. Today, the humanities are more frequently defined as any fields of study outside of professional training, mathematics, and the &lt;a href=\"natural%20sciences\"&gt;natural&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"social%20sciences\"&gt;social sciences&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe humanities use methods that are primarily &lt;a href=\"Critical%20theory\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Continental%20philosophy\"&gt;speculative&lt;/a&gt;, and have a significant historical element\u2014as distinguished from the mainly &lt;a href=\"Empirical%20method\"&gt;empirical&lt;/a&gt; approaches of the &lt;a href=\"natural%20science\"&gt;natural science&lt;/a&gt;s, yet, unlike the sciences, it has no central discipline.\nThe humanities include the study of &lt;a href=\"Languages\"&gt;ancient and modern languages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"literature\"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"history\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anthropology\"&gt;anthropology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human%20geography\"&gt;human geography&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"art\"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt;.\nScholars in the humanities are \"humanities scholars\" or \"humanists\". The term \"humanist\" also describes the philosophical position of &lt;a href=\"humanism\"&gt;humanism&lt;/a&gt;, which some \"&lt;a href=\"antihumanism\"&gt;antihumanist&lt;/a&gt;\" scholars in the humanities reject. The Renaissance scholars and artists are also known as &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20humanism\"&gt;humanists&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href=\"secondary%20school\"&gt;secondary school&lt;/a&gt;s offer humanities classes usually consisting of &lt;a href=\"literature\"&gt;literature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"global%20studies\"&gt;global studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"art\"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman disciplines like &lt;a href=\"history\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"folkloristics\"&gt;folkloristics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cultural%20anthropology\"&gt;cultural anthropology&lt;/a&gt; study subject matters that the manipulative &lt;a href=\"experimental%20method\"&gt;experimental method&lt;/a&gt; does not apply to\u2014and instead mainly use the &lt;a href=\"comparative%20method\"&gt;comparative method&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"comparative%20research\"&gt;comparative research&lt;/a&gt;. Other methods used in the humanities include &lt;a href=\"hermeneutics\"&gt;hermeneutics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"source%20criticism\"&gt;source criticism&lt;/a&gt;.\nFields.\nAnthropology.\n&lt;a href=\"Anthropology\"&gt;Anthropology&lt;/a&gt; is the holistic \"science of humans\", a science of the totality of human existence. The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the &lt;a href=\"social%20science\"&gt;social&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"natural%20science\"&gt;natural science&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the humanities. In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains:\nThe anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology. Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains. Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt;, physical or &lt;a href=\"biological%20anthropology\"&gt;biological anthropology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anthropological%20linguistics\"&gt;anthropological linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cultural%20anthropology\"&gt;cultural anthropology&lt;/a&gt;. It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions. The word () is the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; word for \"human being\" or \"person\". &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Wolf\"&gt;Eric Wolf&lt;/a&gt; described sociocultural anthropology as \"the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences\".\nThe goal of anthropology is to provide a &lt;a href=\"Holism\"&gt;holistic&lt;/a&gt; account of humans and human nature. This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem. Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called \"primitive\" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of \"inferior\". Today, anthropologists use terms such as \"less complex\" societies, or refer to specific modes of &lt;a href=\"subsistence\"&gt;subsistence&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Modes%20of%20production\"&gt;production&lt;/a&gt;, such as \"pastoralist\" or \"forager\" or \"horticulturalist\", to discuss humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (\"ethnos\") remaining of great interest within anthropology.\nThe quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs. In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. Integrating research evidence in depth (detailed social behaviours of, how such are actually embedded in and the ways these are understood by a particular culture), breadth (select human aspects' varying manifestations across a wide range of peoples in differing environments), growth (adoption, persistence, change, abandonment and migration of material resources and products of traditions over eras) and evolution (development of societies, peoples, humanity, hominin species, and the hominid family throughout their existence in time) remains fundamental to any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.\nArchaeology.\nArchaeology is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of &lt;a href=\"material%20culture\"&gt;material culture&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"archaeological%20record\"&gt;archaeological record&lt;/a&gt; consists of &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"biofact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;biofacts&lt;/a&gt; or ecofacts, and &lt;a href=\"cultural%20landscapes\"&gt;cultural landscapes&lt;/a&gt;. Archaeology can be considered both a &lt;a href=\"social%20science\"&gt;social science&lt;/a&gt; and a branch of the humanities. It has various goals, which range from understanding &lt;a href=\"culture%20history\"&gt;culture history&lt;/a&gt; to reconstructing past &lt;a href=\"lifeway\"&gt;lifeway&lt;/a&gt;s to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time.\nArchaeology is thought of as a branch of &lt;a href=\"anthropology\"&gt;anthropology&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right, or grouped under other related disciplines such as &lt;a href=\"history\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;.\nClassics.\n&lt;a href=\"Classics\"&gt;Classics&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20culture\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; academic tradition, refers to the studies of the cultures of &lt;a href=\"classical%20antiquity\"&gt;classical antiquity&lt;/a&gt;, namely Ancient Greek and Latin and the Ancient &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; cultures. Classical studies is considered one of the cornerstones of the humanities; however, its popularity declined during the 20th century. Nevertheless, the influence of classical ideas on many humanities disciplines, such as philosophy and literature, remains strong.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"History\"&gt;History&lt;/a&gt; is systematically collected &lt;a href=\"information\"&gt;information&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href=\"past\"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt;. When used as the name of a &lt;a href=\"field%20of%20study\"&gt;field of study&lt;/a&gt;, \"history\" refers to the study and interpretation of the record of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;societies&lt;/a&gt;, institutions, and any topic that has changed over time.\nTraditionally, the study of history has been considered a part of the humanities. In modern &lt;a href=\"academia\"&gt;academia&lt;/a&gt;, history is occasionally classified as a &lt;a href=\"social%20science\"&gt;social science&lt;/a&gt;.\nLinguistics and languages.\nWhile the scientific study of language is known as &lt;a href=\"linguistics\"&gt;linguistics&lt;/a&gt; and is generally considered a &lt;a href=\"social%20science\"&gt;social science&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"natural%20science\"&gt;natural science&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"cognitive%20science\"&gt;cognitive science&lt;/a&gt;, the study of languages is still central to the humanities. A good deal of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as &lt;a href=\"Wittgenstein\"&gt;Wittgenstein&lt;/a&gt; claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including &lt;a href=\"prose\"&gt;prose&lt;/a&gt; forms (such as the &lt;a href=\"novel\"&gt;novel&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"poetry\"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drama\"&gt;drama&lt;/a&gt;, also lies at the heart of the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs in a &lt;a href=\"foreign%20language\"&gt;foreign language&lt;/a&gt; usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself.\nLaw and politics.\n In common parlance, &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt; means a rule that (unlike a rule of ethics) is enforceable through institutions. The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects. Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context. It has been defined as a \"system of rules\", as an \"interpretive concept\" to achieve justice, as an \"authority\" to mediate people's interests, and even as \"the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction\". However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution. Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every &lt;a href=\"social%20science\"&gt;social science&lt;/a&gt; and discipline of the humanities. Laws are &lt;a href=\"politic\"&gt;politic&lt;/a&gt;s, because politicians create them. Law is &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, because moral and ethical persuasions shape their ideas. Law tells many of &lt;a href=\"history\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;'s stories, because statutes, case law and codifications build up over time. And law is economics, because any rule about &lt;a href=\"contract\"&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tort\"&gt;tort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"property%20law\"&gt;property law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"labour%20law\"&gt;labour law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"company%20law\"&gt;company law&lt;/a&gt; and many more can have long-lasting effects on how productivity is organised and the distribution of wealth. The noun \"law\" derives from the late &lt;a href=\"Old%20English%20language\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; \"lagu\", meaning something laid down or fixed, and the adjective \"legal\" comes from the Latin word \"LEX\".\nLiterature.\n Literature is a term that does not have a universally accepted definition, but which has variably included all written work; writing that possesses literary merit; and language that foregrounds literariness, as opposed to &lt;a href=\"ordinary%20language\"&gt;ordinary language&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Etymology\"&gt;Etymologically&lt;/a&gt; the term derives from &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; \"literatura/litteratura\" \"writing formed with letters\", although some definitions include &lt;a href=\"Oral%20literature\"&gt;spoken or sung texts&lt;/a&gt;. Literature can be classified according to whether it is &lt;a href=\"fiction\"&gt;fiction&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"non-fiction\"&gt;non-fiction&lt;/a&gt;, and whether it is &lt;a href=\"poetry\"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"prose\"&gt;prose&lt;/a&gt;; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the &lt;a href=\"novel\"&gt;novel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"short%20story\"&gt;short story&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"drama\"&gt;drama&lt;/a&gt;; and works are often categorised according to historical periods, or according to their adherence to certain &lt;a href=\"Aesthetics\"&gt;aesthetic&lt;/a&gt; features or expectations (&lt;a href=\"genre\"&gt;genre&lt;/a&gt;).\nPhilosophy.\nPhilosophy\u2014etymologically, the \"love of wisdom\"\u2014is generally the study of problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, justification, truth, justice, right and wrong, beauty, validity, mind, and language. Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing these issues by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on reasoned argument, rather than experiments (&lt;a href=\"experimental%20philosophy\"&gt;experimental philosophy&lt;/a&gt; being an exception).\nPhilosophy used to be a very comprehensive term, including what have subsequently become separate disciplines, such as &lt;a href=\"physics\"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt;. (As &lt;a href=\"Immanuel%20Kant\"&gt;Immanuel Kant&lt;/a&gt; noted, \"Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three sciences: physics, ethics, and logic.\") Today, the main fields of philosophy are &lt;a href=\"logic\"&gt;logic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ethics\"&gt;ethics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"metaphysics\"&gt;metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"epistemology\"&gt;epistemology&lt;/a&gt;. Still, it continues to overlap with other disciplines. The field of &lt;a href=\"semantics\"&gt;semantics&lt;/a&gt;, for example, brings philosophy into contact with &lt;a href=\"linguistics\"&gt;linguistics&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the early twentieth century, philosophy in English-speaking &lt;a href=\"universities\"&gt;universities&lt;/a&gt; has moved away from the humanities and closer to the formal sciences, becoming much more \"analytic.\" &lt;a href=\"Analytic%20philosophy\"&gt;Analytic philosophy&lt;/a&gt; is marked by emphasis on the use of logic and formal methods of reasoning, conceptual analysis, and the use of &lt;a href=\"symbolic%20logic\"&gt;symbolic&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"mathematical%20logic\"&gt;mathematical logic&lt;/a&gt;, as contrasted with the &lt;a href=\"Continental%20philosophy\"&gt;Continental style of philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. This method of inquiry is largely indebted to the work of philosophers such as &lt;a href=\"Gottlob%20Frege\"&gt;Gottlob Frege&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bertrand%20Russell\"&gt;Bertrand Russell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"G.E.%20Moore\"&gt;G.E. Moore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Wittgenstein\"&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\n At present, we do not know of any people or tribe, either from history or the present day, which may be said altogether devoid of \u201creligion.\u201d Religion may be characterized with a community since humans are &lt;a href=\"The%20Social%20Animal%20%28Aronson%20book%29\"&gt;social animals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ritual\"&gt;Rituals&lt;/a&gt; are used to bound the community together. Social animals require rules. &lt;a href=\"Ethics\"&gt;Ethics&lt;/a&gt; is a requirement of society, but not a requirement of religion. Shinto, Daoism, and other folk or natural religions do not have ethical codes. The &lt;a href=\"supernatural\"&gt;supernatural&lt;/a&gt; may or may not include deities since not all religions have deities (&lt;a href=\"Theravada\"&gt;Theravada Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taoism\"&gt;Daoism&lt;/a&gt;). Religion may have &lt;a href=\"belief\"&gt;belief&lt;/a&gt;, but religions are not belief system. Belief systems imply a logical model that religions do not display because of their internal contradictions, lack of evidence, and falsehoods. . &lt;a href=\"Magical%20thinking\"&gt;Magical thinking&lt;/a&gt; creates explanations not available for empirical verification. Stories or &lt;a href=\"Myth\"&gt;myths&lt;/a&gt; are narratives being both didactic and entertaining. They are necessary for understanding the human predicament. Some other possible characteristics of religion are pollutions and purification, the sacred and the profane, sacred texts, religious institutions and organizations, and sacrifice and prayer. Some of the major problems that religions confront, and attempts to answer are chaos, suffering, evil, and death.\nThe non-founder religions are &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shinto\"&gt;Shinto&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20religion\"&gt;native or folk religions&lt;/a&gt;. Founder religions are &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Confucianism\"&gt;Confucianism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taoism\"&gt;Daoism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mormonism\"&gt;Mormonism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jainism\"&gt;Jainism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zoroastrianism\"&gt;Zoroastrianism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sikhism\"&gt;Sikhism&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD%20Faith\"&gt;Baha\u2019i faith&lt;/a&gt;. Religions must adapt and change through the generations because they must remain relevant to the adherents. When traditional religions fail to address new concerns, then new religions will emerge.\nThe humanities uses various mediums attempting to articulate the human predicament and prescribe meanings to the human situation. They are products of the human imagination. They are not discovered but created. If creations characterize the humanities, then religion is the greatest creation of humankind.\nPerforming arts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"performing%20art\"&gt;performing art&lt;/a&gt;s differ from the &lt;a href=\"visual%20arts\"&gt;visual arts&lt;/a&gt; in so far as the former uses the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium, and the latter uses materials such as clay, metal, or paint, which can be molded or transformed to create some &lt;a href=\"work%20of%20art\"&gt;art object&lt;/a&gt;. Performing arts include &lt;a href=\"acrobatics\"&gt;acrobatics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"busking\"&gt;busking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"comedy\"&gt;comedy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dance\"&gt;dance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"film\"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magic%20%28illusion%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"juggling\"&gt;juggling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"marching%20arts\"&gt;marching arts&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"brass%20band\"&gt;brass band&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"theatre\"&gt;theatre&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers, including actors, &lt;a href=\"comedian\"&gt;comedian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dancer\"&gt;dancer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"musician\"&gt;musician&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"singer\"&gt;singer&lt;/a&gt;s. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as &lt;a href=\"songwriting\"&gt;songwriting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stagecraft\"&gt;stagecraft&lt;/a&gt;. Performers often adapt their &lt;a href=\"physical%20appearance\"&gt;appearance&lt;/a&gt;, such as with &lt;a href=\"costume\"&gt;costume&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cosmetics\"&gt;stage makeup&lt;/a&gt;, etc. There is also a specialized form of &lt;a href=\"fine%20art\"&gt;fine art&lt;/a&gt; in which the artists \"perform\" their work live to an audience. This is called &lt;a href=\"Performance%20art\"&gt;Performance art&lt;/a&gt;. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of &lt;a href=\"Theatrical%20property\"&gt;props&lt;/a&gt;. Dance was often referred to as a \"plastic art\" during the &lt;a href=\"Modern%20dance\"&gt;Modern dance&lt;/a&gt; era.\nMusicology.\n&lt;a href=\"Musicology\"&gt;Musicology&lt;/a&gt; as an academic discipline can take a number of different paths, including &lt;a href=\"historical%20musicology\"&gt;historical musicology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"music%20literature\"&gt;music literature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ethnomusicology\"&gt;ethnomusicology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"music%20theory\"&gt;music theory&lt;/a&gt;. Undergraduate music majors generally take courses in all of these areas, while graduate students focus on a particular path. In the &lt;a href=\"liberal%20arts\"&gt;liberal arts&lt;/a&gt; tradition, musicology is also used to broaden skills of non-musicians by teaching skills such as concentration and listening.\nTheatre.\n&lt;a href=\"Theatre\"&gt;Theatre&lt;/a&gt; (or theater) (Greek \"theatron\", \"\u03b8\u03ad\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\") is the branch of the &lt;a href=\"performing%20arts\"&gt;performing arts&lt;/a&gt; concerned with &lt;a href=\"acting\"&gt;acting&lt;/a&gt; out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle \u2014 indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ballet\"&gt;ballet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mime%20artist\"&gt;mime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kabuki\"&gt;kabuki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"classical%20Indian%20dance\"&gt;classical Indian dance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20opera\"&gt;Chinese opera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mummers%27%20play\"&gt;mummers' play&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"pantomime\"&gt;pantomime&lt;/a&gt;.\nDance.\nDance (from &lt;a href=\"Old%20French\"&gt;Old French&lt;/a&gt; \"dancier\", perhaps from &lt;a href=\"Old%20Frankish%20language\"&gt;Frankish&lt;/a&gt;) generally refers to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Motion%20%28physics%29\"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; either used as a form of &lt;a href=\"Emotional%20expression\"&gt;expression&lt;/a&gt; or presented in a &lt;a href=\"Social%20environment\"&gt;social&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spirituality\"&gt;spiritual&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"performance\"&gt;performance&lt;/a&gt; setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of &lt;a href=\"non-verbal%20communication\"&gt;non-verbal communication&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"body%20language\"&gt;body language&lt;/a&gt;) between humans or &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Waggle%20dance\"&gt;bee dance&lt;/a&gt;, mating dance), and &lt;a href=\"Motion%20%28physics%29\"&gt;motion&lt;/a&gt; in inanimate objects (\"the &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; danced in the &lt;a href=\"wind\"&gt;wind&lt;/a&gt;\"). &lt;a href=\"Choreography\"&gt;Choreography&lt;/a&gt; is the art of creating dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer.\nDefinitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on &lt;a href=\"Society\"&gt;social&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Culture\"&gt;cultural&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"aesthetic\"&gt;aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"artistic\"&gt;artistic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"moral\"&gt;moral&lt;/a&gt; constraints and range from functional movement (such as &lt;a href=\"Folk%20dance\"&gt;Folk dance&lt;/a&gt;) to codified, &lt;a href=\"virtuoso\"&gt;virtuoso&lt;/a&gt; techniques such as &lt;a href=\"ballet\"&gt;ballet&lt;/a&gt;.\nVisual arts.\nHistory of visual arts.\nThe great traditions in &lt;a href=\"art\"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt; have a foundation in the art of one of the ancient civilizations, such as &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Japan\"&gt;Ancient Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indus%20Valley%20Civilization\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Nepal\"&gt;Greater Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mesoamerica\"&gt;Mesoamerica&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncient Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Ancient Roman&lt;/a&gt; art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Zeus\"&gt;Zeus&lt;/a&gt;' thunderbolt).\nIn &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20art\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20art\"&gt;Gothic art&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. The &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; saw the return to valuation of the material world, and this shift is reflected in art forms, which show the corporeality of the human body, and the three-dimensional reality of landscape.\nEastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan.\nReligious &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead. The physical and rational certainties depicted by the 19th-century Enlightenment were shattered not only by new discoveries of relativity by &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Einstein\"&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt; and of unseen psychology by &lt;a href=\"Sigmund%20Freud\"&gt;Freud&lt;/a&gt;, but also by unprecedented technological development. Increasing &lt;a href=\"globalization\"&gt;global&lt;/a&gt; interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art.\nMedia types.\nDrawing.\n&lt;a href=\"Drawing\"&gt;Drawing&lt;/a&gt; is a means of making a &lt;a href=\"image\"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt;, using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are &lt;a href=\"graphite\"&gt;graphite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pencil\"&gt;pencil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pen%20and%20ink\"&gt;pen and ink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ink\"&gt;ink&lt;/a&gt;ed &lt;a href=\"brush\"&gt;brush&lt;/a&gt;es, wax &lt;a href=\"color%20pencil\"&gt;color pencil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crayon\"&gt;crayon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pastel\"&gt;pastel&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"marker%20pen\"&gt;markers&lt;/a&gt;. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, &lt;a href=\"hatching\"&gt;hatching&lt;/a&gt;, crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, &lt;a href=\"stippling\"&gt;stippling&lt;/a&gt;, and blending. A computer aided designer who excels in &lt;a href=\"technical%20drawing\"&gt;technical drawing&lt;/a&gt; is referred to as a \"draftsman\" or \"draughtsman\".\nPainting.\n&lt;a href=\"Painting\"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt; taken literally is the practice of applying &lt;a href=\"pigment\"&gt;pigment&lt;/a&gt; suspended in a carrier (or &lt;a href=\"Paint%23Components\"&gt;medium&lt;/a&gt;) and a binding agent (a &lt;a href=\"adhesive\"&gt;glue&lt;/a&gt;) to a surface (support) such as &lt;a href=\"paper\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"canvas\"&gt;canvas&lt;/a&gt; or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with &lt;a href=\"drawing\"&gt;drawing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"composition%20%28visual%20arts%29\"&gt;composition&lt;/a&gt; and other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to &lt;a href=\"Sistine%20Chapel\"&gt;The Sistine Chapel&lt;/a&gt; to the human body itself.\nColour is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but elsewhere white may be. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including &lt;a href=\"Goethe\"&gt;Goethe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wassily%20Kandinsky\"&gt;Kandinsky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton\"&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/a&gt;, have written their own &lt;a href=\"colour%20theory\"&gt;colour theories&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, the use of language is only a generalization for a colour equivalent. The word \"&lt;a href=\"red\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;\", for example, can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum. There is not a formalized register of different colours in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as &lt;a href=\"musical%20notation\"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"musical%20notation\"&gt;C#&lt;/a&gt; in music, although the &lt;a href=\"Pantone\"&gt;Pantone&lt;/a&gt; system is widely used in the printing and design industry for this purpose.\nModern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, for example, &lt;a href=\"collage\"&gt;collage&lt;/a&gt;. This began with &lt;a href=\"cubism\"&gt;cubism&lt;/a&gt; and is not painting in strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cement\"&gt;cement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"straw\"&gt;straw&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; for their &lt;a href=\"Texture%20%28painting%29\"&gt;texture&lt;/a&gt;. Examples of this are the works of &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Dubuffet\"&gt;Jean Dubuffet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Anselm%20Kiefer\"&gt;Anselm Kiefer&lt;/a&gt;. Modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft in favour of &lt;a href=\"concept\"&gt;concept&lt;/a&gt;; this has led some to say that painting, as a serious art form, is dead, although this has not deterred the majority of artists from continuing to practise it either as whole or part of their work.\n&lt;a href=\"Sculpture\"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; involves creating three-dimensional forms out of various materials. These typically include moldable substances like clay and metal but may also extend to material that is cut or shaved down to the desired form, like stone and wood.\nOrigin of the term.\nThe word \"humanities\" is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20Latin\"&gt;Renaissance Latin&lt;/a&gt; expression \"studia humanitatis\", or \"study of \"&lt;a href=\"humanitas\"&gt;humanitas&lt;/a&gt;\"\" (a classical Latin word meaning\u2014in addition to \"humanity\"\u2014\"culture, refinement, education\" and, specifically, an \"education befitting a cultivated man\"). In its usage in the early 15th century, the \"studia humanitatis\" was a course of studies that consisted of grammar, poetry, rhetoric, history, and moral philosophy, primarily derived from the study of Latin and Greek classics. The word \"humanitas\" also gave rise to the Renaissance Italian neologism \"umanisti\", whence \"humanist\", \"&lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20humanism\"&gt;Renaissance humanism&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHistory.\nIn the West, the history of the humanities can be traced to ancient Greece, as the basis of a broad education for citizens. During Roman times, the concept of the seven &lt;a href=\"liberal%20arts\"&gt;liberal arts&lt;/a&gt; evolved, involving &lt;a href=\"grammar\"&gt;grammar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rhetoric\"&gt;rhetoric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"logic\"&gt;logic&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"trivium%20%28education%29\"&gt;trivium&lt;/a&gt;), along with &lt;a href=\"arithmetic\"&gt;arithmetic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"geometry\"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"astrology%20and%20astronomy\"&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"quadrivium\"&gt;quadrivium&lt;/a&gt;). These subjects formed the bulk of &lt;a href=\"medieval\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; education, with the emphasis being on the humanities as skills or \"ways of doing\".\nA major shift occurred with the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20humanism\"&gt;Renaissance humanism&lt;/a&gt; of the fifteenth century, when the humanities began to be regarded as subjects to study rather than practice, with a corresponding shift away from traditional fields into areas such as literature and history. In the 20th century, this view was in turn challenged by the &lt;a href=\"postmodernism\"&gt;postmodernist&lt;/a&gt; movement, which sought to redefine the humanities in more &lt;a href=\"egalitarianism\"&gt;egalitarian&lt;/a&gt; terms suitable for a &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt; society since the Greek and Roman societies in which the humanities originated were not at all democratic.\nToday.\nEducation and employment.\nFor many decades, there has been a growing public perception that a humanities education inadequately prepares graduates for employment. The common belief is that graduates from such programs face underemployment and incomes too low for a humanities education to be worth the investment.\nIn fact, humanities graduates find employment in a wide variety of management and professional occupations. In Britain, for example, over 11,000 humanities majors found employment in the following occupations:\nMany humanities graduates finish university with no career goals in mind. Consequently, many spend the first few years after graduation deciding what to do next, resulting in lower incomes at the start of their career; meanwhile, graduates from career-oriented programs experience more rapid entry into the labour market. However, usually within five years of graduation, humanities graduates find an occupation or career path that appeals to them.\nThere is empirical evidence that graduates from humanities programs earn less than graduates from other university programs. However, the empirical evidence also shows that humanities graduates still earn notably higher incomes than workers with no postsecondary education, and have job satisfaction levels comparable to their peers from other fields. Humanities graduates also earn more as their careers progress; ten years after graduation, the income difference between humanities graduates and graduates from other university programs is no longer statistically significant. Humanities graduates can boost their incomes if they obtain advanced or professional degrees.\nIn the United States.\nThe Humanities Indicators.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Humanities%20Indicators\"&gt;Humanities Indicators&lt;/a&gt;, unveiled in 2009 by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, are the first comprehensive compilation of data about the humanities in the United States, providing scholars, policymakers and the public with detailed information on humanities education from primary to higher education, the humanities workforce, humanities funding and research, and public humanities activities. Modeled after the National Science Board's Science and Engineering Indicators, the Humanities Indicators are a source of reliable benchmarks to guide analysis of the state of the humanities in the United States.\nIf \"The STEM Crisis Is a Myth\", statements about a \"crisis\" in the humanities are also misleading and ignore data of the sort collected by the Humanities Indicators.\n\"The Humanities in American Life\".\nThe 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, \"The Humanities in American Life\":\nThrough the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world where irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.\nAs a major.\nIn 1950, a little over 1 percent of 22-year-olds in the United States had earned a humanities degrees (defined as a degree in English, language, history, philosophy); in 2010, this had doubled to about 2 and a half percent. In part, this is because there was an overall rise in the number of Americans who have any kind of college degree. (In 1940, 4.6 percent had a four-year degree; in 2016, 33.4 percent had one.) As a percentage of the type of degrees awarded, however, the humanities seem to be declining. Harvard University provides one example. In 1954, 36 percent of Harvard undergraduates majored in the humanities, but in 2012, only 20 percent took that course of study. Professor Benjamin Schmidt of Northeastern University has documented that between 1990 and 2008, degrees in English, history, foreign languages, and philosophy have decreased from 8 percent to just under 5 percent of all U.S. college degrees.\nIn liberal arts education.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Commission%20on%20the%20Humanities%20and%20Social%20Sciences\"&gt;The Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; 2013 report \"The Heart of the Matter\" supports the notion of a broad \"&lt;a href=\"Liberal%20arts%20colleges\"&gt;liberal arts education&lt;/a&gt;\", which includes study in disciplines from the natural sciences to the arts as well as the humanities.\nMany &lt;a href=\"colleges\"&gt;colleges&lt;/a&gt; provide such an education; some require it. The &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20University\"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; were among the first schools to require an extensive &lt;a href=\"core%20curriculum\"&gt;core curriculum&lt;/a&gt; in philosophy, literature, and the arts for all students. Other colleges with nationally recognized, mandatory programs in the liberal arts are &lt;a href=\"Fordham%20University\"&gt;Fordham University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20John%27s%20College%20%28Annapolis/Santa%20Fe%29\"&gt;St. John's College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Anselm%20College\"&gt;Saint Anselm College&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Providence%20College\"&gt;Providence College&lt;/a&gt;. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included &lt;a href=\"Mortimer%20J.%20Adler\"&gt;Mortimer J. Adler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"E.%20D.%20Hirsch%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;E. D. Hirsch, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the digital age.\nResearchers in the humanities have developed numerous large- and small-scale digital corporation, such as digitized collections of historical texts, along with the digital tools and methods to analyze them. Their aim is both to uncover new knowledge about corpora and to visualize research data in new and revealing ways. Much of this activity occurs in a field called the &lt;a href=\"digital%20humanities\"&gt;digital humanities&lt;/a&gt;.\nSTEM.\nPoliticians in the United States currently espouse a need for increased funding of the &lt;a href=\"STEM%20fields\"&gt;STEM fields&lt;/a&gt;, science, technology, engineering, mathematics. Federal funding represents a much smaller fraction of funding for humanities than other fields such as STEM or medicine. The result was a decline of quality in both college and pre-college education in the humanities field.\nThree-term Louisiana Governor &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Edwards\"&gt;Edwin Edwards&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged the importance of the humanities in a 2014 video address to the academic conference, \"Revolutions in Eighteenth-Century Sociability\". Edwards said:\nIn Europe.\nThe value of the humanities debate.\nThe contemporary debate in the field of &lt;a href=\"critical%20university%20studies\"&gt;critical university studies&lt;/a&gt; centers around the declining value of the humanities. As in America, there is a perceived decline in interest within higher education policy in research that is qualitative and does not produce marketable products. This threat can be seen in a variety of forms across Europe, but much critical attention has been given to the field of research assessment in particular. For example, the UK [Research Excellence Framework] has been subject to criticism due to its assessment criteria from across the humanities, and indeed, the social sciences. In particular, the notion of \"impact\" has generated significant debate.\nPhilosophical history.\nCitizenship and self-reflection.\nSince the late 19th century, a central justification for the humanities has been that it aids and encourages self-reflection\u2014a self-reflection that, in turn, helps develop personal consciousness or an active sense of civic duty.\n&lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Dilthey\"&gt;Wilhelm Dilthey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gadamer\"&gt;Hans-Georg Gadamer&lt;/a&gt; centered the humanities' attempt to distinguish itself from the natural sciences in &lt;a href=\"humankind\"&gt;humankind&lt;/a&gt;'s urge to understand its own experiences. This understanding, they claimed, ties like-minded people from similar cultural backgrounds together and provides a sense of cultural continuity with the philosophical past.\nScholars in the late 20th and early 21st centuries extended that \"narrative imagination\" to the ability to understand the records of lived experiences outside of one's own individual social and cultural context. Through that narrative &lt;a href=\"imagination\"&gt;imagination&lt;/a&gt;, it is claimed, humanities scholars and students develop a &lt;a href=\"conscience\"&gt;conscience&lt;/a&gt; more suited to the multicultural world we live in. That conscience might take the form of a passive one that allows more effective &lt;a href=\"self-reflection\"&gt;self-reflection&lt;/a&gt; or extend into active empathy that facilitates the dispensation of civic duties a responsible world citizen must engage in. There is disagreement, however, on the level of influence humanities study can have on an individual and whether or not the understanding produced in humanistic enterprise can guarantee an \"identifiable positive effect on people.\"\nHumanistic theories and practices.\nThere are three major branches of knowledge: &lt;a href=\"natural%20sciences\"&gt;natural sciences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"social%20sciences\"&gt;social sciences&lt;/a&gt;, and the humanities. &lt;a href=\"Technology\"&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt; is the practical extension of the natural sciences, as &lt;a href=\"politics\"&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt; is the extension of the social sciences. Similarly, the humanities have their own practical extension, sometimes called \"transformative humanities\" (transhumanities) or \"culturonics\" (&lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Epstein\"&gt;Mikhail Epstein&lt;/a&gt;'s term):\nTechnology, politics and culturonics are designed to transform what their respective disciplines study: nature, society, and culture. The field of transformative humanities includes various practicies and technologies, for example, &lt;a href=\"language%20planning\"&gt;language planning&lt;/a&gt;, the construction of new languages, like &lt;a href=\"Esperanto\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, and invention of new artistic and literary genres and movements in the genre of &lt;a href=\"manifesto\"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"Romanticism\"&gt;Romanticism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Symbolism%20%28arts%29\"&gt;Symbolism&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Surrealism\"&gt;Surrealism&lt;/a&gt;. Humanistic &lt;a href=\"invention\"&gt;invention&lt;/a&gt; in the sphere of culture, as a practice complementary to scholarship, is an important aspect of the humanities.\nTruth and meaning.\nThe divide between humanistic study and natural sciences informs arguments of meaning in humanities as well. What distinguishes the humanities from the &lt;a href=\"natural%20science\"&gt;natural science&lt;/a&gt;s is not a certain subject matter, but rather the mode of approach to any question. Humanities focuses on understanding meaning, purpose, and goals and furthers the appreciation of singular historical and social phenomena\u2014an interpretive method of finding \"truth\"\u2014rather than explaining the causality of events or uncovering the truth of the natural world. Apart from its societal application, narrative imagination is an important tool in the (re)production of understood meaning in history, culture and literature.\nImagination, as part of the tool kit of artists or scholars, helps create meaning that invokes a response from an audience. Since a humanities scholar is always within the &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Anexus\"&gt;nexus&lt;/a&gt; of lived experiences, no \"absolute\" knowledge is theoretically possible; knowledge is instead a ceaseless procedure of inventing and reinventing the context a text is read in. &lt;a href=\"Poststructuralism\"&gt;Poststructuralism&lt;/a&gt; has problematized an approach to the humanistic study based on questions of meaning, intentionality, and authorship. In the wake of &lt;a href=\"Death%20of%20the%20author\"&gt;the death of the author&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed by &lt;a href=\"Barthes\"&gt;Roland Barthes&lt;/a&gt;, various theoretical currents such as &lt;a href=\"deconstruction\"&gt;deconstruction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"discourse\"&gt;discourse&lt;/a&gt; analysis seek to expose the ideologies and rhetoric operative in producing both the purportedly meaningful objects and the &lt;a href=\"hermeneutic\"&gt;hermeneutic&lt;/a&gt; subjects of humanistic study. This exposure has opened up the interpretive structures of the humanities to criticism that humanities scholarship is \"unscientific\" and therefore unfit for inclusion in modern university curricula because of the very nature of its changing contextual meaning.\nPleasure, the pursuit of knowledge and scholarship.\nSome, like &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Fish\"&gt;Stanley Fish&lt;/a&gt;, have claimed that the humanities can defend themselves best by refusing to make any claims of utility. (Fish may well be thinking primarily of literary study, rather than history and philosophy.) Any attempt to justify the humanities in terms of outside benefits such as social usefulness (say increased productivity) or in terms of ennobling effects on the individual (such as greater wisdom or diminished prejudice) is ungrounded, according to Fish, and simply places impossible demands on the relevant academic departments. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"critical%20thinking\"&gt;critical thinking&lt;/a&gt;, while arguably a result of humanistic training, can be acquired in other contexts. And the humanities do not even provide any more the kind of social cachet (what sociologists sometimes call \"&lt;a href=\"cultural%20capital\"&gt;cultural capital&lt;/a&gt;\") that was helpful to succeed in Western society before the age of mass education following World War II.\nInstead, scholars like Fish suggest that the humanities offer a unique kind of pleasure, a pleasure based on the common pursuit of knowledge (even if it is only disciplinary knowledge). Such pleasure contrasts with the increasing privatization of leisure and instant gratification characteristic of Western culture; it thus meets &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BCrgen%20Habermas\"&gt;J\u00fcrgen Habermas&lt;/a&gt;' requirements for the disregard of social status and rational problematization of previously unquestioned areas necessary for an endeavor which takes place in the bourgeois &lt;a href=\"public%20sphere\"&gt;public sphere&lt;/a&gt;. In this argument, then, only the academic pursuit of pleasure can provide a link between the private and the public realm in modern Western consumer society and strengthen that public sphere that, according to many theorists, is the foundation for modern democracy.\nOthers, like &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Bauerlein\"&gt;Mark Bauerlein&lt;/a&gt;, argue that professors in the humanities have increasingly abandoned proven methods of &lt;a href=\"epistemology\"&gt;epistemology&lt;/a&gt; (\"I care only about the quality of your arguments, not your conclusions.\") in favor of &lt;a href=\"indoctrination\"&gt;indoctrination&lt;/a&gt; (\"I care only about your conclusions, not the quality of your arguments.\"). The result is that professors and their students adhere rigidly to a limited set of viewpoints, and have little interest in, or understanding of, opposing viewpoints. Once they obtain this intellectual self-satisfaction, persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation are common.\nRomanticization and rejection.\nImplicit in many of these arguments supporting the humanities are the makings of arguments against public support of the humanities. &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Carroll%20%28scholar%29\"&gt;Joseph Carroll&lt;/a&gt; asserts that we live in a changing world, a world where \"cultural capital\" is replaced with \"&lt;a href=\"scientific%20literacy\"&gt;scientific literacy&lt;/a&gt;\", and in which the romantic notion of a Renaissance humanities scholar is obsolete. Such arguments appeal to judgments and anxieties about the essential uselessness of the humanities, especially in an age when it is seemingly vitally important for scholars of literature, history and the arts to engage in \"collaborative work with experimental scientists or even simply to make \"intelligent use of the findings from empirical science.\" \nDespite many humanities based arguments against the humanities some within the exact sciences have called for their return. In 2017, Science popularizer &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Nye\"&gt;Bill Nye&lt;/a&gt; retracted previous claims about the supposed 'uselessness' of philosophy. As Bill Nye states, \u201cPeople allude to Socrates and Plato and Aristotle all the time, and I think many of us who make those references don\u2019t have a solid grounding,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know the history of philosophy.\u201d Scholars, such as biologist &lt;a href=\"Scott%20F.%20Gilbert\"&gt;Scott F. Gilbert&lt;/a&gt;, make the claim that it is in fact the increasing predominance, leading to exclusivity, of scientific ways of thinking that need to be tempered by historical and social context. Gilbert worries that the commercialization that may be inherent in some ways of conceiving science (pursuit of funding, academic prestige etc.) need to be examined externally. Gilbert argues \"First of all, there is a very successful alternative to science as a commercialized march to \u201cprogress.\u201d This is the approach taken by the liberal arts college, a model that takes pride in seeing science in context and in integrating science with the humanities and social sciences.\""
