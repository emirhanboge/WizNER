    "text": "Eliza (foaled 1990 in &lt;a href=\"Kentucky\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;) is an American &lt;a href=\"Thoroughbred\"&gt;Thoroughbred&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eclipse%20Award\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"horse%20racing\"&gt;racehorse&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nA descendant of the great &lt;a href=\"Nearco\"&gt;Nearco&lt;/a&gt; through both her sire and her dam, Eliza was sired by multiple stakes winner, Mt. Livermore, a son of the outstanding sire, &lt;a href=\"Blushing%20Groom\"&gt;Blushing Groom&lt;/a&gt;. Her dam was owner &lt;a href=\"Allen%20E.%20Paulson\"&gt;Allen Paulson's&lt;/a&gt; Daring Bidder, a daughter of the 1966 &lt;a href=\"American%20Champion%20Older%20Male%20Horse\"&gt;American Co-Champion Older Male Horse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bold%20Bidder\"&gt;Bold Bidder&lt;/a&gt;. In his 2003 book, \"Legacies of the Turf\", noted race historian &lt;a href=\"Edward%20L.%20Bowen\"&gt;Edward L. Bowen&lt;/a&gt; wrote that according to Paulson family banter, Madeleine Paulson traded &lt;a href=\"Cigar%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Cigar&lt;/a&gt; to husband Allen for Eliza.\nRacing career.\nRacing in Allen Paulson's name, Eliza was trained in 1992 by the then thirty-year-old &lt;a href=\"Alex%20L.%20Hassinger%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Alex Hassinger Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, who had just obtained his training license. At age two, the filly made five starts. She finished second in the &lt;a href=\"Sorrento%20Stakes\"&gt;Sorrento Stakes&lt;/a&gt; and won the &lt;a href=\"Arlington-Washington%20Lassie%20Stakes\"&gt;Arlington-Washington Lassie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alcibiades%20Stakes\"&gt;Alcibiades Stakes&lt;/a&gt; en route to the most important win of her career, the &lt;a href=\"Breeders%27%20Cup%20Juvenile%20Fillies\"&gt;Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies&lt;/a&gt;. Raced that year at &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gulfstream%20Park\"&gt;Gulfstream Park&lt;/a&gt;, Eliza set a new stakes record time. Her 1992 performances earned her &lt;a href=\"American%20Champion%20Two-Year-Old%20Filly\"&gt;American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly&lt;/a&gt; honors.\nAt age three, Eliza made four starts. She won the Grade I &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Anita%20Oaks\"&gt;Santa Anita Oaks&lt;/a&gt;, ran second to &lt;a href=\"Dispute%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Dispute&lt;/a&gt; in the Grade I &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Oaks\"&gt;Kentucky Oaks&lt;/a&gt;, and was third against &lt;a href=\"Colt%20%28horse%29\"&gt;colt&lt;/a&gt;s in the Grade I &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Anita%20Derby\"&gt;Santa Anita Derby&lt;/a&gt;. She made four more starts at age four in 1994, her best result a third in the June Darling Handicap at &lt;a href=\"Del%20Mar%20Racetrack\"&gt;Del Mar Racetrack&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreeding record.\nRetired to &lt;a href=\"broodmare\"&gt;broodmare&lt;/a&gt; duty, Eliza was bred to Allen Paulson's &lt;a href=\"Theatrical%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Theatrical&lt;/a&gt; plus important stallions such as &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Bird\"&gt;Storm Bird&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A.P.%20Indy\"&gt;A.P. Indy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fusaichi%20Pegasus\"&gt;Fusaichi Pegasus&lt;/a&gt;. The most successful of her foals in racing was Mr. Kent who won four races in &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and earned the equivalent of &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20dollar\"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;728,607."
