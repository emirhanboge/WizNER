    "text": "Arnold William Umbach Jr. (December 6, 1942 \u2013 May 30, 2020) was an American &lt;a href=\"professional%20baseball\"&gt;professional baseball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pitcher\"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; who appeared in parts of two seasons in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1964%20Milwaukee%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1964 Milwaukee Braves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"1966%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season\"&gt;1966 Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"right-handed\"&gt;right-hander&lt;/a&gt; whose pro career extended from 1961 through 1968, he was listed as tall and .\nUmbach was born in &lt;a href=\"Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Williamsburg, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, but grew up in &lt;a href=\"Auburn%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Auburn, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;; he graduated from &lt;a href=\"Tennessee\"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Baylor%20School\"&gt;Baylor School&lt;/a&gt;, then later returned to his home city to earn a degree from &lt;a href=\"Auburn%20University\"&gt;Auburn University&lt;/a&gt;. Fresh off his schoolboy career, he signed a $100,000 bonus contract with the Braves in June 1961. After four seasons in the club's &lt;a href=\"farm%20system\"&gt;farm system&lt;/a&gt;, he was called up to Milwaukee in September 1964 and given a &lt;a href=\"starting%20pitcher\"&gt;start&lt;/a&gt; in the club's next-to-last game of the season, October 3 against the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Pirates\"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20County%20Stadium\"&gt;County Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. He went 8 &lt;a href=\"innings%20pitched\"&gt;innings&lt;/a&gt; and departed with an 11\u20133 lead after surrendering 11 &lt;a href=\"hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; and four &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt;. Two &lt;a href=\"earned%20run\"&gt;unearned runs&lt;/a&gt; would score off Umbach's successor on the mound, &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Baseball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"left-handed\"&gt;southpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Spahn\"&gt;Warren Spahn&lt;/a&gt; (in Spahn's 714th and final appearance in a Brave uniform), but Umbach secured the victory in his &lt;a href=\"MLB\"&gt;MLB&lt;/a&gt; debut. After spending 1965 at &lt;a href=\"Triple-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Triple-A&lt;/a&gt;, Umbach worked in 22 games during 1966, the Braves' first year in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, losing his only two &lt;a href=\"decision%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;decisions&lt;/a&gt; but posting a solid 3.10 &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt;. Of his 22 appearances, three were starts, and on June 4, he held the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Cardinals\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; to seven hits and one unearned run, again going 8 innings. But he departed the game with the score tied at one, and his reliever, veteran &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Abernathy\"&gt;Ted Abernathy&lt;/a&gt;, got credit for the victory when Atlanta broke through with the winning tally in the home half of the ninth.\nUmbach appeared in 23 MLB games, and fashioned a 1\u20132 &lt;a href=\"win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29\"&gt;won\u2013lost record&lt;/a&gt;. He permitted 51 hits and 22 bases on balls in 49 career innings pitched, with 30 &lt;a href=\"strikeout\"&gt;strikeout&lt;/a&gt;s. After the 1966 season, he was included in a blockbuster trade that sent longtime Braves star &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Mathews\"&gt;Eddie Mathews&lt;/a&gt;, also a future Hall of Famer, to the &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Astros\"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;. But Umbach never appeared in a Houston uniform and retired after only two &lt;a href=\"Double-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Double-A&lt;/a&gt; appearances in 1968. \nIn addition to Auburn University, Umbach attended law school at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Alabama%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;University of Alabama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emory%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt; and after his pitching career ended he was a practicing attorney in his home city of Auburn. He died at his home there on May 30, 2020, due to complications from &lt;a href=\"Parkinson%27s%20disease\"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;."
