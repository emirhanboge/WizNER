According to the , it has a population of people.\nLocated directly east of &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, it is known for the &lt;a href=\"Ortigas%20Center\"&gt;Ortigas Center&lt;/a&gt;, a commercial and business center that is also shared with the city of &lt;a href=\"Pasig\"&gt;Pasig&lt;/a&gt;. Notable institutions and establishments in the city include the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Development%20Bank\"&gt;Asian Development Bank&lt;/a&gt;, the headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Banco%20De%20Oro\"&gt;Banco De Oro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"San%20Miguel%20Corporation\"&gt;San Miguel Corporation&lt;/a&gt; and shopping malls like &lt;a href=\"Shangri-La%20Plaza\"&gt;Shangri-La Plaza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SM%20Megamall\"&gt;SM Megamall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%2C%20Metro%20Manila\"&gt;San Juan&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Quezon%20City\"&gt;Quezon City&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast, &lt;a href=\"Pasig\"&gt;Pasig&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and &lt;a href=\"Makati\"&gt;Makati&lt;/a&gt; to the south. It is also the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20the%20Philippines%23List\"&gt;6th-smallest city&lt;/a&gt; in the Philippines with a land area of , similar to &lt;a href=\"Makati\"&gt;Makati&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marikina\"&gt;Marikina&lt;/a&gt;\nEtymology.\nThere are different stories on the origin of the name \"Mandaluyong\".\nOne tells of how the place was abundant with a kind of tree called \"luyong\", now more commonly known as \"anahaw\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Saribus%20rotundifolius\"&gt;Saribus rotundifolius&lt;/a&gt;\"), from which canes and furniture were made.\nAnother claims that the Spaniards named the place based on the report of a navigator named Acapulco, who saw the rolling hills frequently being lashed at by \"daluyong\" (\u201cbig waves from the sea\u201d). This seems to confirm traditional pre-Hispanic stories that giant waves from the sea would meet the adjoining hills of the vast lowland, referred to as \"salpukan ng alon\". Felix dela Huerta, a &lt;a href=\"Franciscan\"&gt;Franciscan&lt;/a&gt; historian, observed that the rolling topography of this land resembled giant waves of the sea.\nAs with the etymological legends of many Philippine places, when the foreigners asked what the place was called, the locals answered with the description \"madaluyong\" (\"undulating\"), later transcribed by Spanish writers as \"Mandaluyong,\" with the addition of an \u201cn\u201d.\nAnother version of the name is based on a legend that a &lt;a href=\"Maharlika\"&gt;Maharlika&lt;/a&gt; named Luyong fell in love with Manda, the lovely daughter of a &lt;a href=\"barangay\"&gt;barangay&lt;/a&gt; chieftain. The chieftain did not like Luyong and forbade him Manda's hand. Luyong overcame this objection by winning a series of tribal contests, as was the custom at the time. The couple settled thereafter in a place which was later called \u201cMandaluyong\" - a term made up of &lt;a href=\"portmanteau\"&gt;joining their names&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n14th century.\nResidents of Mandaluyong have always been known for their industry. Men did the laundry to the amusement of non-residents until shortly after the war, while the women ironed the clothes.\nThese industrious people trace their roots to Emperor Soledan (also known as \u201cAnka Widyaya\u201d of the Great Madjapahit Empire) and Empress Sasaban of the &lt;a href=\"Namayan\"&gt;Kingdom of Sapa&lt;/a&gt;, whose son Prince Balagtas ruled as sovereign of the kingdom in about the year 1300.\nMore than a century later, in about the year 1470, it expanded and was called the \u201c&lt;a href=\"Namayan\"&gt;Kingdom of Namayan&lt;/a&gt;\u201d with \u201cLakan Takhan\u201d as sovereign. The vast Kingdom comprised what are now &lt;a href=\"Quiapo%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Quiapo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"San%20Miguel%2C%20Manila\"&gt;San Miguel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Mesa%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Sta, Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paco%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Paco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandacan\"&gt;Pandacan&lt;/a&gt;, Malate, &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Malate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Ana%2C%20Manila\"&gt;Santa Ana&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, and Mandaluyong, &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%2C%20Metro%20Manila\"&gt;San Juan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Makati\"&gt;Makati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pasay\"&gt;Pasay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pateros\"&gt;Pateros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taguig\"&gt;Taguig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Para%C3%B1aque\"&gt;Para\u00f1aque&lt;/a&gt;, and portions of &lt;a href=\"Pasig\"&gt;Pasig&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quezon%20City\"&gt;Quezon City&lt;/a&gt; up to &lt;a href=\"Diliman\"&gt;Diliman&lt;/a&gt;, which were then part of Mandaluyong.\n19th century.\nMandaluyong was first known as a barrio of Santa Ana de Sapa, which was part of the District of Paco, Province of Tondo. Named San Felipe Neri by the Spaniards in honor of the patron saint of &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, it was separated civilly from Santa Ana de Sapa in 1841.\nOn 15 September 1863 &lt;a href=\"St.%20Philip%20Neri\"&gt;San Felipe Neri&lt;/a&gt; established its own parish. Under the administration of the Congregation \u201cDulc\u00edsimo Nombre de Jes\u00fas\u201d, it constructed its own church, convent and school. The Parish of San Felipe Neri played a significant role as a relay station for propagating the Katipunan during the 1896\u20131898 Revolution.\nMandaluyong was significant in the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Revolution\"&gt;Philippine Revolution&lt;/a&gt; of 1896 as the baluarte (territory) of the Katipunan or \"Makabuhay\" group, with seventeen branches.\nOn 29 August 1896, &lt;a href=\"Andres%20Bonifacio\"&gt;Andres Bonifacio&lt;/a&gt;, together with &lt;a href=\"Emilio%20Jacinto\"&gt;Emilio Jacinto&lt;/a&gt; and other members of the &lt;a href=\"Katipunan\"&gt;Katipunan&lt;/a&gt; went into the house of Romualdo Vicencio at Sitio Balakbak (now Villa San Miguel) to prepare for the upcoming revolution against Spanish authority. In this site, Bonifacio read the last manifestation of the Katipunan before they transferred in Hagdan Bato, in the house of Felix Sanchez. This event is also known as the \"29 De Agosto\" and \"Pinagtipunan\" in which it is already named in two streets near the historic Barangay Hagdan Bato Itaas. It was in Barangay Hagdang Bato on 28 August 1896 where Andres Bonifacion issued a proclamation setting Saturday, 29 August 1896 as the date of the attack on Manila.\nOn 30 August 1896, after the successfully revolution in San Felipe Neri, the katipuneros went to San Juan del Monte and attacked the El Polvorin (gunpowder depot) in order to amass more weapons to use against the Spaniards. This event is popularly known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20San%20Juan%20del%20Monte\"&gt;Battle of San Juan del Monte&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was also in this town that the revolutionary paper, \u201cLa Republika\u201d, was established on 15 September 1896.\n20th century.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"American%20Colonial%20Period%20%28Philippines%29\"&gt;American Occupation&lt;/a&gt;, San Felipe Neri was raised to a first class municipality with five barrios, namely: Poblacion, Barangka, Hagdang Bato, Namayan and Hulo. Under Presidential Act No. 942, it was consolidated with the municipality of &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%2C%20Metro%20Manila\"&gt;San Juan del Monte&lt;/a&gt; and became the seat of government. For several months in 1904, San Felipe Neri became the capital of the province of &lt;a href=\"Rizal%20Province\"&gt;Rizal&lt;/a&gt;.\nSan Felipe Neri was separated from San Juan and became an independent municipality on 27 March 1907. It was renamed the Municipality of Mandaluyong by virtue of House Bill No. 3836 which was authored and sponsored by Assemblyman Pedro Magsalin, then the Representative of the District of Rizal. Many government infrastructures are established during the American Period including the Correctional Institute for Women, Welfareville Compound, The Boy's Town, and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Center%20for%20Mental%20Health\"&gt;National Center for Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Mandaluyong lost many of her people; among them were Catholic priests and civilians. Destruction was felt all over, but with the timely arrival of the American Liberation Forces and the Philippine Commonwealth troops on 9 February 1945, the municipality was saved from further damages. That day became a red calendar day for Mandaluyong marking its liberation from the Japanese Imperial forces by the Allies.\nAfter World War II, Mandaluyong began to become progressive and dramatically increase the economy. Many infrastructures, companies, and other businesses were developed in 1950s\u20131960s and as the result, Mandaluyong recognized as the most developed municipality in the Province of Rizal.\nSeparation from Rizal province.\nOn 7 November 1975, Mandaluyong was formally included in newly established Metropolitan Manila by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824 signed by President &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Marcos\"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy virture of the 1987 Constitution Mandaluyong and the then municipality of San Juan were represented in congress by a single Congressman.\nCityhood.\nRep. Ronaldo Zamora sponsored a House Bill which eventually became Republic Act No. 7675 otherwise known as \"An Act Converting the Municipality of Mandaluyong into a Highly Urbanized City to be known as the City of Mandaluyong.\" President &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Ramos\"&gt;Fidel V. Ramos&lt;/a&gt; signed R.A. No. 7675 into law on 9 February 1994 (the 49th anniversary of its liberation from the Japanese), which was ratified through a plebiscite on 10 April 1994 making Mandaluyong the 5th city in &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Manila\"&gt;Metro Manila&lt;/a&gt;. Mandaluyong became a lone district with its own Representative in Congress. Prior to the enactment of the assailed statute, the municipalities of Mandaluyong and San Juan belonged to only one legislative district.\n21st century.\nMandaluyong today is composed of 27 barangays divided into two political districts mainly by Boni Avenue and G. Aglipay Street. As of 9 January 2002, it has 1,238 voting precincts and 166,037 registered voters.\nIn 2003, Mandaluyong was recognized as \"The Tiger City of the Philippines\" because of dramatic improvement in the city's economy.\nHistory of local barrios.\nAccording to Pedro Patricio in his book (Mandaluyong: 1837\u20131975), Mandaluyong had five original barrios (Poblacion, Barangka, Hagdang Bato, Namayan, &amp; Hulo) as per the first recorded census in 1903. From these five evolved 22 sub-barrios.\nGeography.\nMandaluyong lies on a heart-shaped of land, southeast of Manila and west of Pasig. To the south lies Makati, to the northwest, San Juan, and to the northeast, Quezon City. Thus Mandaluyong is located at the center of Metro Manila.\nBarangays.\nMandaluyong is politically subdivided into 27 &lt;a href=\"barangays\"&gt;barangays&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nMandaluyong's climate is classified as tropical.

The city is one of the important business and financial areas in the metropolis.\nCommercial activities.\nLike other cities in &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Manila\"&gt;Metro Manila&lt;/a&gt;, Mandaluyong has its own share of commercial strips and a central business district.\nThe former commercial area, consisting mostly of banks, offices and service establishments, stretch along public transport routes thereby serving both local consumers and passers-by from the neighboring localities.\nMajor commercial strips of the city include the stretch of &lt;a href=\"Boni%20Avenue\"&gt;Boni Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shaw%20Boulevard\"&gt;Shaw Boulevard&lt;/a&gt;, Libertad-Sierra Madre area, Kalentong, San Francisco, part of Martinez, Sgt.

Although prominent in the manufacture of foods, medicines and laboratory equipment, these industries are gradually declining in number, opting to relocate in newly developed industrial zones outside Metropolitan Manila. In the &lt;a href=\"Pasig%20River\"&gt;Pasig River&lt;/a&gt; area, particularly in Barangays Namayan and Mabini J. Rizal, areas formerly industrial are now the sites for residential subdivisions and townhouses.
