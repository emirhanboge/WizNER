    "text": "A breadboard, or protoboard, is a construction base for &lt;a href=\"prototype\"&gt;prototyping&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"electronic%20circuit\"&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt;. Originally the word referred to a literal bread board, a polished piece of wood used when slicing bread. In the 1970s the solderless breadboard ( plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term \"breadboard\" is commonly used to refer to these.\nBecause the solderless breadboard does not require &lt;a href=\"soldering\"&gt;soldering&lt;/a&gt;, it is reusable. This makes it easy to use for creating temporary prototypes and experimenting with circuit design. For this reason, solderless breadboards are also popular with students and in technological education. Older breadboard types did not have this property. A &lt;a href=\"stripboard\"&gt;stripboard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Veroboard\"&gt;Veroboard&lt;/a&gt;) and similar prototyping &lt;a href=\"printed%20circuit%20board\"&gt;printed circuit board&lt;/a&gt;s, which are used to build semi-permanent soldered prototypes or one-offs, cannot easily be reused. A variety of electronic systems may be prototyped by using breadboards, from small analog and digital circuits to complete &lt;a href=\"central%20processing%20unit\"&gt;central processing unit&lt;/a&gt;s (CPUs).\nCompared to more permanent circuit connection methods, modern breadboards have high parasitic capacitance, relatively high resistance, and less reliable connections, which are subject to jostle and physical degradation. Signaling is limited to about 10 MHz, and not everything works properly even well below that frequency. \nA common use in the &lt;a href=\"system%20on%20a%20chip\"&gt;system on a chip&lt;/a&gt; (SoC) era is to obtain an &lt;a href=\"microcontroller\"&gt;microcontroller&lt;/a&gt; (MCU) on a pre-assembled &lt;a href=\"printed%20circuit%20board\"&gt;printed circuit board&lt;/a&gt; (PCB) which exposes an array of &lt;a href=\"input/output\"&gt;input/output&lt;/a&gt; (IO) pins in a header suitable to plug into a breadboard, and then to prototype a circuit which exploits one or more of the MCU's peripherals, such as &lt;a href=\"general-purpose%20input/output\"&gt;general-purpose input/output&lt;/a&gt; (GPIO), &lt;a href=\"UART\"&gt;UART&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"USART\"&gt;USART&lt;/a&gt; serial transceivers, &lt;a href=\"analog-to-digital%20converter\"&gt;analog-to-digital converter&lt;/a&gt; (ADC), &lt;a href=\"digital-to-analog%20converter\"&gt;digital-to-analog converter&lt;/a&gt; (DAC), &lt;a href=\"pulse-width%20modulation\"&gt;pulse-width modulation&lt;/a&gt; (PWM; used in &lt;a href=\"motor%20controller\"&gt;motor control&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Serial%20Peripheral%20Interface\"&gt;Serial Peripheral Interface&lt;/a&gt; (SPI), or &lt;a href=\"I%C2%B2C\"&gt;I\u00b2C&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Firmware\"&gt;Firmware&lt;/a&gt; is then developed for the MCU to test, debug, and interact with the circuit prototype. High frequency operation is then largely confined to the SoC's PCB. In the case of high speed interconnects such as SPI and I\u00b2C, these can be debugged at a lower speed and later rewired using a different circuit assembly methodology to exploit full-speed operation. A single small SoC often provides most of these electrical interface options in a form factor barely larger than a large postage stamp, available in the American hobby market (and elsewhere) for a few dollars, allowing fairly sophisticated breadboard projects to be created at modest expense.\nEvolution.\nIn the early days of radio, amateurs nailed bare copper wires or terminal strips to a wooden board (often literally a board to slice bread on) and soldered electronic components to them. Sometimes a paper &lt;a href=\"schematic%20diagram\"&gt;schematic diagram&lt;/a&gt; was first glued to the board as a guide to placing terminals, then components and wires were installed over their symbols on the schematic. Using &lt;a href=\"thumbtack\"&gt;thumbtack&lt;/a&gt;s or small nails as mounting posts was also common.\nBreadboards have evolved over time, with the term now being used for all kinds of prototype electronic devices. For example, US Patent 3,145,483, was filed in 1961 and describes a wooden plate breadboard with mounted springs and other facilities. US Patent 3,496,419, was filed in 1967 and refers to a particular &lt;a href=\"printed%20circuit%20board\"&gt;printed circuit board&lt;/a&gt; layout as a \"Printed Circuit Breadboard\". Both examples refer to and describe other types of breadboards as &lt;a href=\"prior%20art\"&gt;prior art&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe breadboard most commonly used today is usually made of white plastic and is a pluggable (solderless) breadboard. It was designed by Ronald J. Portugal in 1971.\nAlternatives.\nAlternative methods to create prototypes are &lt;a href=\"point-to-point%20construction\"&gt;point-to-point construction&lt;/a&gt; (reminiscent of the original wooden breadboards), &lt;a href=\"wire%20wrap\"&gt;wire wrap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wiring%20pencil\"&gt;wiring pencil&lt;/a&gt;, and boards like the stripboard. Complicated systems, such as modern computers comprising millions of &lt;a href=\"transistor\"&gt;transistor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"diode\"&gt;diode&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"resistor\"&gt;resistor&lt;/a&gt;s, do not lend themselves to prototyping using breadboards, as their complex designs can be difficult to lay out and &lt;a href=\"debug\"&gt;debug&lt;/a&gt; on a breadboard.\nModern circuit designs are generally developed using a &lt;a href=\"schematic%20capture\"&gt;schematic capture&lt;/a&gt; and simulation system, and tested in &lt;a href=\"electronic%20circuit%20simulation\"&gt;software simulation&lt;/a&gt; before the first prototype circuits are built on a &lt;a href=\"printed%20circuit%20board\"&gt;printed circuit board&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Integrated%20circuit\"&gt;Integrated circuit&lt;/a&gt; designs are a more extreme version of the same process: since producing prototype silicon is costly, extensive software simulations are performed before fabricating the first prototypes. However, prototyping techniques are still used for some applications such as &lt;a href=\"Radio%20frequency\"&gt;RF&lt;/a&gt; circuits, or where software models of components are inexact or incomplete.\nIt is also possible to use a square grid of pairs of holes where one hole per pair connects to its row and the other connects to its column. This same shape can be in a circle with rows and columns each spiraling opposite clockwise/counterclockwise.\nSolderless breadboard.\nTypical specifications.\nA modern solderless breadboard socket (invented by Ronald J Portugal for E&amp;L Instruments, Derby CT) consists of a perforated block of plastic with numerous &lt;a href=\"Plating%23Tin%20plating\"&gt;tin plated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"phosphor%20bronze\"&gt;phosphor bronze&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"nickel%20silver\"&gt;nickel silver&lt;/a&gt; alloy spring clips under the perforations. The clips are often called \"tie points\" or \"contact points\". The number of tie points is often given in the specification of the breadboard.\nThe spacing between the clips (lead pitch) is typically . &lt;a href=\"Integrated%20circuit\"&gt;Integrated circuit&lt;/a&gt;s (ICs) in &lt;a href=\"dual%20in-line%20package\"&gt;dual in-line package&lt;/a&gt;s (DIPs) can be inserted to straddle the centerline of the block. Interconnecting wires and the leads of discrete components (such as &lt;a href=\"capacitor\"&gt;capacitor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"resistor\"&gt;resistor&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"inductor\"&gt;inductor&lt;/a&gt;s) can be inserted into the remaining free holes to complete the circuit. Where ICs are not used, discrete components and connecting wires may use any of the holes. Typically the spring clips are rated for 1 &lt;a href=\"ampere\"&gt;ampere&lt;/a&gt; at 5 &lt;a href=\"volt\"&gt;volt&lt;/a&gt;s and 0.333 amperes at 15 volts (5 &lt;a href=\"watt\"&gt;watt&lt;/a&gt;s). The edge of the board has male and female &lt;a href=\"Dovetail%20joint\"&gt;dovetail&lt;/a&gt; notches so boards can be clipped together to form a large breadboard.\nBus and terminal strips.\nSolderless breadboards connect pin to pin by metal strips inside the breadboard. The layout of a typical solderless breadboard is made up from two types of areas, called strips. Strips consist of interconnected electrical terminals.\nSome manufacturers provide separate bus and terminal strips. Others just provide breadboard blocks which contain both in one block. Often breadboard strips or blocks of one brand can be clipped together to make a larger breadboard.\nIn a more robust variant, one or more breadboard strips are mounted on a sheet of metal. Typically, that backing sheet also holds a number of &lt;a href=\"binding%20post\"&gt;binding post&lt;/a&gt;s. These posts provide a clean way to connect an external power supply. This type of breadboard may be slightly easier to handle. Several images in this article show such solderless breadboards.\nDiagram.\nA \"full size\" terminal breadboard strip typically consists of around 56 to 65 rows of connectors, each row containing the above-mentioned two sets of connected clips (A to E and F to J). Together with bus strips on each side this makes up a typical 784 to 910 tie point solderless breadboard. \"Small size\" strips typically come with around 30 rows. Miniature solderless breadboards as small as 17 rows (no bus strips, 170 tie points) can be found, but these are only suitable for small and simple designs.\nJump wires.\n&lt;a href=\"Jump%20wire\"&gt;Jump wire&lt;/a&gt;s (also called jumper wires) for solderless breadboarding can be obtained in ready-to-use jump wire sets or can be manually manufactured. The latter can become tedious work for larger circuits. Ready-to-use jump wires come in different qualities, some even with tiny plugs attached to the wire ends. Jump wire material for ready-made or homemade wires should usually be 22\u00a0&lt;a href=\"American%20wire%20gauge\"&gt;AWG&lt;/a&gt; (0.33\u00a0mm2) solid copper, tin-plated wire - assuming no tiny plugs are to be attached to the wire ends. The wire ends should be stripped . Shorter stripped wires might result in bad contact with the board's spring clips (insulation being caught in the springs). Longer stripped wires increase the likelihood of short-circuits on the board. &lt;a href=\"Needle-nose%20pliers\"&gt;Needle-nose pliers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tweezers\"&gt;tweezers&lt;/a&gt; are helpful when inserting or removing wires, particularly on crowded boards.\nDifferently colored wires and &lt;a href=\"color%20code\"&gt;color-coding&lt;/a&gt; discipline are often adhered to for consistency. However, the number of available colors is typically far fewer than the number of signal types or paths. Typically, a few wire colors are reserved for the supply voltages and ground (e.g., red, blue, black), some are reserved for main signals, and the rest are simply used where convenient. Some ready-to-use jump wire sets use the color to indicate the length of the wires, but these sets do not allow a meaningful color-coding schema.\nAdvanced solderless breadboards.\nSome manufacturers provide high-end versions of solderless breadboards. These are typically high-quality breadboard modules mounted on a flat casing. The casing contains additional equipment for breadboarding, such as a &lt;a href=\"power%20supply\"&gt;power supply&lt;/a&gt;, one or more &lt;a href=\"signal%20generator\"&gt;signal generator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"serial%20interface\"&gt;serial interface&lt;/a&gt;s, LED display or LCD modules, and &lt;a href=\"logic%20probe\"&gt;logic probe&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSolderless breadboard modules can also be found mounted on devices like &lt;a href=\"microcontroller\"&gt;microcontroller&lt;/a&gt; evaluation boards. They provide an easy way to add additional periphery circuits to the evaluation board.\nHigh frequencies and dead bugs.\nFor high-frequency development, a metal breadboard affords a desirable solderable ground plane, often an unetched piece of printed circuit board; integrated circuits are sometimes stuck upside down to the breadboard and soldered to directly, a technique sometimes called \"&lt;a href=\"Point-to-point%20construction%23%26quot%3BDead%20bug%26quot%3B%20construction\"&gt;dead bug&lt;/a&gt;\" construction because of its appearance. Examples of dead bug with ground plane construction are illustrated in a Linear Technologies application note.\nLimitations.\nDue to relatively large &lt;a href=\"parasitic%20capacitance\"&gt;parasitic capacitance&lt;/a&gt; compared to a properly laid out PCB (approx 2\u00a0pF between adjacent contact columns), high &lt;a href=\"inductance\"&gt;inductance&lt;/a&gt; of some connections and a relatively high and not very reproducible contact &lt;a href=\"Electrical%20resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt;, solderless breadboards are limited to operation at relatively low frequencies, usually less than 10\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Megahertz\"&gt;MHz&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the nature of the circuit. The relatively high contact resistance can already be a problem for some DC and very low frequency circuits. Solderless breadboards are further limited by their voltage and current ratings.\nSolderless breadboards usually cannot accommodate &lt;a href=\"surface-mount%20technology\"&gt;surface-mount technology&lt;/a&gt; devices (SMD) or components with grid spacing other than . Further, they cannot accommodate components with multiple rows of connectors if these connectors do not match the &lt;a href=\"Dual%20in-line%20package\"&gt;dual in-line&lt;/a&gt; layout\u2014it is impossible to provide the correct electrical connectivity. Sometimes small &lt;a href=\"Printed%20circuit%20board\"&gt;PCB&lt;/a&gt; adapters called \"breakout adapters\" can be used to fit the component to the board. Such adapters carry one or more components and have spaced male connector pins in a &lt;a href=\"Single%20in-line%20package\"&gt;single in-line&lt;/a&gt; or dual in-line layout, for insertion into a solderless breadboard. Larger components are usually plugged into a socket on the adapter, while smaller components (e.g., SMD resistors) are usually soldered directly onto the adapter. The adapter is then plugged into the breadboard via the connectors. However, the need to solder the components onto the adapter negates some of the advantage of using a solderless breadboard.\nVery complex circuits can become unmanageable on a solderless breadboard due to the large amount of wiring required. The very convenience of easy plugging and unplugging of connections also makes it too easy to accidentally disturb a connection, and the system becomes unreliable. It is possible to prototype systems with thousands of connecting points, but great care must be taken in careful assembly, and such a system becomes unreliable as contact resistance develops over time. At some point, very complex systems must be implemented in a more reliable interconnection technology, to have a likelihood of working over a usable time period."
