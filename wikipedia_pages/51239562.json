    "text": "ELeague, shortened as EL, and stylized as \u039eLEAGUE is an &lt;a href=\"esports\"&gt;esports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sports%20league\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; and American &lt;a href=\"television%20show\"&gt;television show&lt;/a&gt; that aired on &lt;a href=\"TBS%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;TBS&lt;/a&gt;. It was announced in September 2015 as a partnership between &lt;a href=\"Turner%20Broadcasting\"&gt;Turner Broadcasting&lt;/a&gt; and talent agency &lt;a href=\"Endeavor%20%28company%29\"&gt;WME/IMG&lt;/a&gt;. The name \"ELeague\" was officially unveiled later that year.\nLaunched with \"\" in May 2016, the league featured 24 teams from across the world to compete in two 10-week league seasons annually, which includes a regular season, playoffs, and a championship. ELeague currently has no plans to lock teams into exclusivity, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Championship%20Gaming%20Series\"&gt;Championship Gaming Series&lt;/a&gt;, a previous attempt to bring professional video games to &lt;a href=\"television%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;television in the United States&lt;/a&gt;. Matches are broadcast live on TBS every Friday night.\nELeague later shortened the number of teams in the tournament to sixteen for CS:GO. The third season of ELeague featured the popular fighting game \"&lt;a href=\"Street%20Fighter\"&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/a&gt;\". EL also featured side events, such as the &lt;a href=\"Overwatch%20%28video%20game%29\"&gt;\"Overwatch\"&lt;/a&gt; Open and the \"&lt;a href=\"Rocket%20League\"&gt;Rocket League&lt;/a&gt;\" Cup. The addition of esports programming was of part of a plan to revamp original programming for TBS. The broadcast is simultaneously available online through &lt;a href=\"Twitch%20%28service%29\"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"YouTube\"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, with additional content also being streamed. Matches are played at the Turner Studios facility in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason 1.\n&lt;a href=\"ELeague%20Season%201\"&gt;ELeague Season 1&lt;/a&gt; began on May 24, 2016. Twenty-four teams were divided into six groups. After each team in a group plays the other three teams in its group twice, the teams are placed into a four-team, single-elimination bracket, with seeding based on the results of the group results. The winner of the group bracket moves on to the Playoffs and the runner-up moves on to the Last Chance Qualifier bracket. In addition, the top two third-place teams move on to the Last Chance Qualifier bracket. The Last Chance Qualifier teams play in an eight-team, single-elimination bracket, in which two teams move on to the Playoffs bracket. The Playoffs consisted of the six group winners\u2014&lt;a href=\"Team%20EnVyUs\"&gt;Team EnVyUs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fnatic\"&gt;Fnatic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Natus%20Vincere\"&gt;Natus Vincere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cloud9\"&gt;Cloud9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Astralis\"&gt;Astralis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ninjas%20in%20Pyjamas\"&gt;Ninjas in Pyjamas&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and the two teams out of the Last Chance Qualifier\u2014&lt;a href=\"mousesports\"&gt;mousesports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Virtus.pro\"&gt;Virtus.pro&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe finals took place on July 30, 2016. It headed Fnatic and Virtus.pro, in which Virtus.pro won 2\u20130, and the inaugural ELeague season.\n&lt;a href=\"Luminosity%20Gaming\"&gt;Luminosity Gaming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"SK%20Gaming\"&gt;SK Gaming&lt;/a&gt; were both disqualified from ELeague. The Luminosity players, coach, and manager had all signed with SK to play with the team in the future prior to joining Luminosity. After weeks of contract disputes, Luminosity and SK settled to an agreement, resulting in the Brazilians joining SK Gaming and the Danish players forming a new team, Team X. ELeague saw this as a promotional campaign for the teams, thus, disqualifying both teams from the tournament. It was later reported that at least five ELeague participants\u2014&lt;a href=\"Cloud9%20%28eSports%29\"&gt;Cloud9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Fox\"&gt;Echo Fox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NRG%20Esports\"&gt;NRG Esports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Team%20Liquid\"&gt;Team Liquid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Team%20SoloMid\"&gt;Team SoloMid&lt;/a&gt;\u2014petitioned to prevent the current SK Gaming from inheriting Luminosity's spot in the Playoffs. SK Gaming's Epit\u00e1cio \"TACO\" de Melo alleged that his team was not notified of the ruling before it was publicly announced.\nSeason 2.\nAt the end of the season 1 finals, analyst &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Lewis%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;Richard Lewis&lt;/a&gt; announced that the second season of ELeague would air on October 7, 2016. ELeague confirmed that the second season will once again use \"CS:GO\".\nThe second season strayed away from the first season's format. Instead, it reflected the format of that of a &lt;a href=\"Valve%20Corporation\"&gt;Valve&lt;/a&gt;-sponsored \"CS:GO\" major, such as or &lt;a href=\"ESL%20One%20Cologne%202016\"&gt;ESL One Cologne 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The season will feature open and closed qualifiers, double elimination group stages, and\u2014like last season\u2014a Playoffs.\nThe second season began on October 21, 2016. The eight teams in the playoffs were the group winners\u2014&lt;a href=\"mousesports\"&gt;mousesports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virtus.pro\"&gt;Virtus.pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Astralis\"&gt;Astralis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Team%20Dignitas\"&gt;Team Dignitas&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and the group runners-up\u2014&lt;a href=\"FaZe%20Clan\"&gt;FaZe Clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ninjas%20in%20Pyjamas\"&gt;Ninjas in Pyjamas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"SK%20Gaming\"&gt;SK Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"OpTic%20Gaming\"&gt;OpTic Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe finals pitted Astralis, which defeated Ninjas in Pyjamas and SK Gaming, and OpTic Gaming, which defeated mousesports and FaZe Clan. In the end, OpTic Gaming defeated Astralis, two games to one, to win season two of ELeague.\nSeason 3 \u2013 \"ELeague Street Fighter V Invitational\".\nFor the third season, ELeague invited thirty-two players from around the world to compete in this tournament. Sixteen of the players were invited based on their &lt;a href=\"Capcom%20Cup%202016%23Capcom%20Pro%20Tour\"&gt;2016 Capcom Pro Tour&lt;/a&gt; results and the other sixteen received invites from &lt;a href=\"Capcom\"&gt;Capcom&lt;/a&gt;. The 32 players will advance to the regular season and then eight players will advance to the playoffs.\nSeason 4 \u2013 \"ELeague CS:GO Premier\".\nThe fourth season of ELeague returned to competitive play in \"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\". Initially, twelve teams were invited to the competition based on previous ELeague results. Another four teams would have to qualify in their respective regional qualifiers. However, &lt;a href=\"ELeague%20Season%202\"&gt;Season 2&lt;/a&gt; champion OpTic Gaming only kept one of its five players, as stanislaw moved to Team Liquid shortly after winning the Season 2 title, tarik and RUSH were transferred to Cloud9, and NAF was moved to the backup position and then later joined &lt;a href=\"Renegades%20%28eSports%29\"&gt;Renegades&lt;/a&gt;, leaving mixwell as the only remaining member of the squad. OpTic later brought in four Europeans to fill up its lineup. Replacing the majority of the lineup would thus disqualify the team based on the ELeague ruleset. A third team from the Americas qualifier, which would later be Renegades, took its spot in the tournament.\nThe playoffs pitted the group winners\u2014&lt;a href=\"FaZe%20Clan\"&gt;FaZe Clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Copenhagen\"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cloud9\"&gt;Cloud9&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Astralis\"&gt;Astralis&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and the group runners-up\u2014&lt;a href=\"G2%20Esports\"&gt;G2 Esports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fnatic\"&gt;Fnatic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Team%20EnVyUs\"&gt;Team EnVyUs&lt;/a&gt;, and Heroic.\nAstralis defeated Fnatic and Cloud9 to reach the finals and FaZe Clan defeated Team EnVyUs and North on its path to the finals. Astralis kept its same lineup as it had when it won the ELeague Major 2017 while FaZe Clan brought in its new superteam and had not lost a map on LAN since losing to Gambit Esports at DreamHack Masters Malm\u00f6 2017. FaZe Clan defeated Astralis 2\u20130 after a huge comeback from 12\u20133 on the first map and dominated the second map to take home the fourth rendition of ELeague.\nReality TV Series \u2013 \"ELEAGUE The Challenger: Street Fighter V\".\nIn 2018, ELeague announced their first-ever reality TV series, \"ELEAGUE The Challenger: Street Fighter V\". The series featured seven invited personalities from the fighting game scene as they lived together in one house and competed against each other for a single prize. The series showcased the contestants playing against each other in the &lt;a href=\"Capcom\"&gt;Capcom&lt;/a&gt; fighting game \"&lt;a href=\"Street%20Fighter%20V\"&gt;Street Fighter V&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as the drama and interaction between them as they spent their days living under one roof.

Like other majors, the top eight teams from the last major, &lt;a href=\"ESL%20One%20Cologne%202016\"&gt;ESL One Cologne 2016&lt;/a&gt;, will be invited to the major and eight other teams will play through a qualifier.

The group stage format differed completely from previous majors, as the major would use a 16-team Swiss system rather than the four group GSL system.\nThe top eight teams in this major were &lt;a href=\"Natus%20Vincere\"&gt;Natus Vincere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virtus.pro\"&gt;Virtus.pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Astralis\"&gt;Astralis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Copenhagen\"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FaZe%20Clan\"&gt;FaZe Clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fnatic\"&gt;Fnatic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"SK%20Gaming\"&gt;SK Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gambit%20Gaming\"&gt;Gambit Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, who were called Legends by making the top eight.\nIn the quarterfinals, Astralis defeated Natus Vincere, Fnatic defeated Gambit Gaming, Virtus.pro defeated North, and SK Gaming defeated FaZe Clan.
