    "text": "The 1872\u201373 season was the second season of competitive &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; by Queen's Park.\nOverview.\nQueen's Park again entered the FA Cup in 1872\u201373. This was the only season the FA Cup was a true \"challenge\" cup. The defending champions were given a bye to the final with the remaining teams facing off against one another to determine who should challenge them for the trophy.\nIn order to reduce travel, Queen's Park were given byes through to the semi-finals where they were due to face &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20University%20F.C.\"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt; for the right to face defending champions &lt;a href=\"Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; in the final. However, they withdrew before the match and Oxford University were given a walkover.\nDuring the club's early years, the team would play in dark blue shirts and grey shorts. The now traditional black and white hoops weren't introduced until October 1873."
