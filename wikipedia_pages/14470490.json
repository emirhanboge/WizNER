    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"woodworking\"&gt;woodworking&lt;/a&gt;, a moulding plane (molding plane in US spelling) is a specialised &lt;a href=\"plane%20%28tool%29\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; used for making the complex shapes found in wooden &lt;a href=\"Molding%20%28decorative%29\"&gt;mouldings&lt;/a&gt;. \nTraditionally, moulding planes were blocks of wear resistant hardwood, often &lt;a href=\"beech\"&gt;beech&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"maple\"&gt;maple&lt;/a&gt;, which were worked to the shape of the intended moulding. The blade, or &lt;a href=\"iron%20%28plane%29\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; was likewise formed to the intended moulding profile and secured in the body of the plane with a wooden wedge. A traditional &lt;a href=\"cabinetmaker\"&gt;cabinetmaker&lt;/a&gt;s shop might have many, perhaps hundreds, of moulding planes for the full range of work to be performed. The late nineteenth century brought modern types which were all-metal affairs such as the American &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Works\"&gt;Stanley&lt;/a&gt; No. 55 Universal Plane and the English Record No. 405 &lt;a href=\"Multi-Plane\"&gt;Multi-Plane&lt;/a&gt; with a wide variety of interchangeable cutters, integral fences, and \"nickers\", small cutting edges which score the grain fibers when working across the board.\nLarge &lt;a href=\"crown%20moulding\"&gt;crown moulding&lt;/a&gt;s required planes of six or more inches in width, which demanded great strength to push and often had additional peg handles on the sides, allowing the craftsman's &lt;a href=\"apprentice\"&gt;apprentice&lt;/a&gt; or other worker to pull the plane ahead of the master who guided it.\nWhile generally considered outdated, a modern furniture shop doing reproduction or restoration work might keep a collection of moulding planes to match original work, or to build in an authentic manner.\nThe earliest known record of a moulding plane is a moulding plane iron of Roman origin unearthed in Cologne, Germany.\nIn modern industry, the work of the moulding plane has been taken up by the electrically powered spindle &lt;a href=\"moulder\"&gt;moulder&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wood%20shaper\"&gt;wood shaper&lt;/a&gt;. On a smaller scale, the hand-held or table-mounted electric &lt;a href=\"Router%20%28woodworking%29\"&gt;router&lt;/a&gt; allows the use of interchangeable &lt;a href=\"router%20bit\"&gt;router bit&lt;/a&gt;s of a wide variety of profiles and is readily available to the small business or home craftsperson.
