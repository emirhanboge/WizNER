    "text": "Frosinone (, local dialect: ) is a town and \"&lt;a href=\"comune\"&gt;comune&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Lazio\"&gt;Lazio&lt;/a&gt;, central Italy, the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20%28political%29\"&gt;administrative seat&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20Frosinone\"&gt;province of Frosinone&lt;/a&gt;. It is located about south-east of &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; close to the &lt;a href=\"Autostrada%20A1%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;Rome-Naples A1 Motorway&lt;/a&gt;. The city is the main city of the &lt;a href=\"Valle%20Latina\"&gt;Valle Latina&lt;/a&gt; (\"Latin Valley\"), an &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; geographical and historical region that extends from south of Rome to Cassino.\nHistory.\nThe first traces of human presence around modern Frosinone date from the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Paleolithic\"&gt;Lower Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; (around 250,000 years ago). The earliest settlements in the area are from around 4,000 years ago, including late &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Age\"&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt; remains in what is now the upper part of the city (12th-10th century BC) and 7th-6th century BC sepultures. 21 tombs from a &lt;a href=\"Volscan\"&gt;Volscan&lt;/a&gt; necropolis were found in the Frosinone centre. \"Frusino\" (as it is called in ancient &lt;a href=\"Latin%20literature\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; sources) was part of the &lt;a href=\"Hernici\"&gt;Hernici&lt;/a&gt;,but its inhabitants were mostly Volscians. In 306 BC, the city took part in the Hernic League against Rome; defeated and sacked, it lost much of its territories to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Ferentino\"&gt;Ferentino&lt;/a&gt;. Later, during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Punic%20War\"&gt;Second Punic War&lt;/a&gt;, it was devastated by &lt;a href=\"Hannibal\"&gt;Hannibal&lt;/a&gt;'s armies, to which it refused to surrender.\nThe Roman writer &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt; had a \"&lt;a href=\"Roman%20villa\"&gt;villa&lt;/a&gt;\" in Frusino. The city obtained the citizenship rights and became a colony in &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman imperial&lt;/a&gt; times, when part of its lands were assigned to &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Army\"&gt;Roman legionaries&lt;/a&gt;. Frosinone was the birthplace of two early Christian popes, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Hormisdas\"&gt;Hormisdas&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Silverius\"&gt;Silverius&lt;/a&gt; (6th century AD), who are now its patron saints.\nAfter the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Western Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Frosinone was destroyed several times by foreign invaders; in the early Middle Ages it was an agricultural center of the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Rome\"&gt;Duchy of Rome&lt;/a&gt;. After escaping the dominance of the nearby commune of &lt;a href=\"Anagni\"&gt;Anagni&lt;/a&gt;, in the early 14th century it fell under &lt;a href=\"Alatri\"&gt;Alatri&lt;/a&gt;. In 1350, it was damaged by an earthquake. After the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Rome%20%281527%29\"&gt;Sack of Rome (1527)&lt;/a&gt;, Frosinone was also ravaged by German, Florentine and French troops and again, in 1556, by Spanish troops fighting against &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Paul%20IV\"&gt;Pope Paul IV&lt;/a&gt;. The following year it became the official seat of the papal governor of the province of Campagna and Marittima.\nFrosinone steadily expanded its population in modern times, passing from around 2,000 people in the mid-17th century to the over 10,000 it had at the &lt;a href=\"Unification%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Unification of Italy&lt;/a&gt; (late 19th century). In 1863, it was connected to the national railway network. In 1927, the Fascist government made it the capital of a new province, created with territories from the provinces of Caserta and Rome. In 1943-1944, during the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; invasion of southern occupied Italy in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, it was bombed 56 times by Anglo-American planes; the first Allied troops entered Frosinone on 31 May 1944.\nAfter the war, as the city was rebuilt in more modern lines, Frosinone lost its traditional agricultural role in favour of industry and, above all, &lt;a href=\"tertiary%20%28economic%29\"&gt;tertiary&lt;/a&gt; (commercial) activities. In 1962, it was reached by the &lt;a href=\"Autostrada%20A1%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;A1 Rome-Naples&lt;/a&gt; motorway.\nGeography.\nFrosinone is in &lt;a href=\"Latium\"&gt;Latium&lt;/a&gt; and is the main city of the &lt;a href=\"Valle%20Latina\"&gt;Valle Latina&lt;/a&gt; (\"Latin Valley\") The town is surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"Ernici%20Mountains\"&gt;Ernici&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lepini%20Mountains\"&gt;Lepini&lt;/a&gt; mountain ranges. \nCulture.\n&lt;a href=\"Frosinone%20Calcio\"&gt;Frosinone Calcio&lt;/a&gt; is a professional football team based that plays at the &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Benito%20Stirpe\"&gt;Stadio Benito Stirpe&lt;/a&gt; in Frosinone. The &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Serie%20A\"&gt;2018\u201319 season&lt;/a&gt; was the team's second season in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt;, the highest &lt;a href=\"Italian%20football%20league%20system\"&gt;level of professional football in Italy&lt;/a&gt;."
