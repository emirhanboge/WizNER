    "text": "David Hobson (born 18 November 1960) is an Australian &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt; and composer.\nCareer.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Ballarat\"&gt;Ballarat&lt;/a&gt;, Australia, Hobson sang with church and school choirs and local music groups as a child, but he was still vocally untrained when he performed as lead singer and bass guitarist with &lt;a href=\"rock%20band\"&gt;rock band&lt;/a&gt;s while studying at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite the lack of a demonstration tape of \"Macbeth\" (see below) he was invited to join the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20State%20Opera\"&gt;Victoria State Opera&lt;/a&gt;, understudying the role of Frederic in the VSO's &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Papp\"&gt;Joseph Papp&lt;/a&gt; (Broadway) version of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pirates%20of%20Penzance\"&gt;The Pirates of Penzance&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1986. This led to his becoming a member of the company's Young Artists Programme, and making his debut as Rodolfo in a Victorian country tour production of \"&lt;a href=\"La%20boh%C3%A8me\"&gt;La boh\u00e8me&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1987. In 1988 he made his debut with The Australian Opera (now &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Australia\"&gt;Opera Australia&lt;/a&gt;) when he created the role of Lawrence in the world premiere of Brian Howard's opera \"Whitsunday\".\nHe is the &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt; of \"Macbeth\" (a 1985 music theatre piece), \"Remembering Rosie\" (2001 chamber opera), \"The Loch Ard Suite\" (for the 2002 light/sound installation \"Shipwrecked\" at &lt;a href=\"Warrnambool\"&gt;Warrnambool&lt;/a&gt;) and the award-winning 2004 orchestral score for the Australian film \"&lt;a href=\"One%20Perfect%20Day%20%282004%20film%29\"&gt;One Perfect Day&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as a number of songs including \"Inside This Room\" and the title song for \"One Perfect Day\".\nIn 1990, he reprised the role of Rodolfo, opposite &lt;a href=\"Cheryl%20Barker\"&gt;Cheryl Barker&lt;/a&gt; as Mim\u00ec, in a new production of \"La boh\u00e8me\" for The Australian Opera, directed by &lt;a href=\"Baz%20Luhrmann\"&gt;Baz Luhrmann&lt;/a&gt;; this went on to become one of the company's most successful productions. It was filmed during its 1993 return season and broadcast on &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation\"&gt;ABC TV&lt;/a&gt; several times. Released on VHS in 1994, it was to become the first opera available on DVD (1998) and continues to be a best seller worldwide.\nHobson's &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan\"&gt;Gilbert and Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; roles with Opera Australia, include Nanki-Poo in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mikado\"&gt;The Mikado&lt;/a&gt;\", Marco Palmieri in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gondoliers\"&gt;The Gondoliers&lt;/a&gt;\", Ralph Rackstraw in \"&lt;a href=\"H.M.S.%20Pinafore\"&gt;H.M.S. Pinafore&lt;/a&gt;\" and the Defendant in \"&lt;a href=\"Trial%20by%20Jury\"&gt;Trial by Jury&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHobson returned to the role of Frederic in the record-breaking Opera Australia production of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pirates%20of%20Penzance\"&gt;The Pirates of Penzance&lt;/a&gt;\" with seasons during 2006 in Sydney at the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Opera%20House\"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Canberra\"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Brisbane\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; at the Lyric Theatre, &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20Performing%20Arts%20Centre\"&gt;Queensland Performing Arts Centre&lt;/a&gt;. The national tour continued in 2007, with seasons in &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, making a total of 100 performances in ten months.\nHis operatic repertoire extends from 17th century works to the present, Hobson's high lyric tenor voice (he is actually a rare \"&lt;a href=\"haute-contre\"&gt;haute-contre&lt;/a&gt;\" or baroque tenor) is best suited to the &lt;a href=\"baroque\"&gt;baroque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bel%20canto\"&gt;bel canto&lt;/a&gt; operas of the 18th and early 19th centuries, such as those composed by Mozart and Rossini. His &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart\"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt; roles include Ferrando in \"&lt;a href=\"Cos%C3%AC%20fan%20tutte\"&gt;Cos\u00ec fan tutte&lt;/a&gt;\", Don Ottavio in \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Giovanni\"&gt;Don Giovanni&lt;/a&gt;\", Tamino in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Magic%20Flute\"&gt;The Magic Flute&lt;/a&gt;\" and Belmonte in \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Entf%C3%BChrung%20aus%20dem%20Serail\"&gt;The Abduction from the Seraglio&lt;/a&gt;\". His &lt;a href=\"Gioachino%20Rossini\"&gt;Rossini&lt;/a&gt; roles include Lindoro in \"&lt;a href=\"L%27italiana%20in%20Algeri\"&gt;L'italiana in Algeri&lt;/a&gt;\", Ramiro in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20Cenerentola\"&gt;La Cenerentola&lt;/a&gt;\", Count Almaviva in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Barber%20of%20Seville\"&gt;The Barber of Seville&lt;/a&gt;\", Dorvil in \"&lt;a href=\"La%20scala%20di%20seta\"&gt;La scala di seta&lt;/a&gt;\" and Florville in \"&lt;a href=\"Il%20signor%20Bruschino\"&gt;Il signor Bruschino&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMany other roles have included Ernesto in Donizetti's \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Pasquale\"&gt;Don Pasquale&lt;/a&gt;\", Nadir in Bizet's \"&lt;a href=\"Les%20p%C3%AAcheurs%20de%20perles\"&gt;The Pearl Fishers&lt;/a&gt;\", and a highly acclaimed Orph\u00e9e in Gluck's \"&lt;a href=\"Orfeo%20ed%20Euridice\"&gt;Orph\u00e9e et Eurydice&lt;/a&gt;\", (the rarely performed 1774 Paris version for &lt;a href=\"tenor\"&gt;tenor&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn 2008, he made his role debut as Nemorino in Donizetti's \"&lt;a href=\"L%27elisir%20d%27amore\"&gt;L'elisir d'amore&lt;/a&gt;\" with the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Opera%20%28Melbourne%29\"&gt;Victorian Opera&lt;/a&gt;, and created several roles in their world premiere season of \"&lt;a href=\"Through%20the%20Looking%20Glass%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Through the Looking Glass&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Alan%20John\"&gt;Alan John&lt;/a&gt;.\nHobson created the role of the Chevalier de Danceny in the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Opera\"&gt;San Francisco Opera&lt;/a&gt; world premiere of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dangerous%20Liaisons\"&gt;The Dangerous Liaisons&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Conrad%20Susa\"&gt;Conrad Susa&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Architect in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Eighth%20Wonder\"&gt;The Eighth Wonder&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Alan%20John\"&gt;Alan John&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Chamberlain\"&gt;Michael Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Lindy%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Lindy&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Moya%20Henderson\"&gt;Moya Henderson&lt;/a&gt; for Opera Australia.\nIn 2006, he sang the title role in a &lt;a href=\"Perth%20International%20Arts%20Festival\"&gt;Perth International Arts Festival&lt;/a&gt; concert performance of \"&lt;a href=\"Candide%20%28operetta%29\"&gt;Candide&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Bernstein\"&gt;Leonard Bernstein&lt;/a&gt; and received rave reviews. Just weeks later he had the honour of singing before &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20II\"&gt;Elizabeth II&lt;/a&gt; and many other distinguished guests, at a State Dinner in &lt;a href=\"Canberra\"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;.\nHobson is a much sought-after concert artist, frequently appearing in &lt;a href=\"Musica%20Viva%20Australia\"&gt;Musica Viva&lt;/a&gt; recitals, and oratorios such as Handel's \"&lt;a href=\"Messiah%20%28Handel%29\"&gt;Messiah&lt;/a&gt;\", and Mendelssohn's \"&lt;a href=\"Elijah%20%28oratorio%29\"&gt;Elijah&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as opera galas, recitals and solo concerts, displaying both his extensive classical and lighter repertoires.
