    "text": "Maama Molitika (26 August 1974) is a &lt;a href=\"Tonga\"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;n former &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; footballer. He is 6'5\". He has played numerous times for the &lt;a href=\"Tonga%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;national Tongan team&lt;/a&gt;, making his debut in June 1997 against &lt;a href=\"Fiji%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;. He was also in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Islanders%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Pacific Islanders rugby union team&lt;/a&gt; squad that toured Europe in 2006. He played as a blind-side flanker.\nIn 2002\u201303 he was &lt;a href=\"Bridgend%20Ravens\"&gt;Bridgend&lt;/a&gt;'s joint top &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; scorer of the season, and was a part of the team that went on to win the Welsh Premiership for the first time in the club's history. Following the regionalisation of Welsh rugby in 2003\u201304, he joined the now defunct &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Warriors\"&gt;Celtic Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, and played the one season that the region existed for, including playing for them in the &lt;a href=\"Heineken%20Cup\"&gt;Heineken Cup&lt;/a&gt;. After the Warriors were dissolved at the end of the 2003\u201304 season, he signed to play for &lt;a href=\"Harlequin%20F.C.\"&gt;Harlequin F.C.&lt;/a&gt; in the English premiership. He then moved to Welsh region the &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20Blues\"&gt;Cardiff Blues&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2006 he went to Japan and played for Japanese team IBM Big Blue.\nHowever, it was announced in 2007 that he would be returning to the Cardiff Blues to cover for players that would be absent due to Wales' World Cup campaign, as well as covering for any injured players.\nOn his return to the Cardiff Blues, Molitika dispelled previous concerns that his standard of play would have decreased from a year in the less-competitive Japanese League, with some outstanding performances for the Cardiff Blues. Molitika had established himself as the teams' first-choice flanker with his effective ball-carrying and his tireless work-rate winning much praise from coaches and fans alike. \nMaama in the 2012-13 season will be hired by the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20San%20Don%C3%A0\"&gt;Rugby San Don\u00e0&lt;/a&gt;, a newly promoted Italian team that were excelling after winning the Serie A 2011-2012. Maama became a very important man for the Venetian team.\nMaama also has a cousin, Haloti Molitika, who is currently playing for Worcester Rugby Club's Academy side.\nMaama also coached local rugby Team Sully Sports Rfc who play in the WRU Div 7 league and university side Bedfordshire Bull's Luton campus team."
