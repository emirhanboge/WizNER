    "text": "Lucca ( , ) is a city and \"&lt;a href=\"comune\"&gt;comune&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Tuscany\"&gt;Tuscany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Central%20Italy\"&gt;Central Italy&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Serchio\"&gt;Serchio&lt;/a&gt; River, in a fertile plain near the &lt;a href=\"Ligurian%20Sea\"&gt;Ligurian Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The city has a population of about 89,000, while its &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Lucca\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; has a population of 383,957. \nLucca is known as one of the Italian's \"Citt\u00e0 d'arte\" (Arts town), thanks to its intact &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;-era &lt;a href=\"city%20walls\"&gt;city walls&lt;/a&gt; and its very well preserved historic center, where, among other buildings and monuments, are located the &lt;a href=\"Piazza%20dell%27Anfiteatro\"&gt;Piazza dell'Anfiteatro&lt;/a&gt;, which has its origins in the second half of the 1st century A.D. and the &lt;a href=\"Guinigi%20Tower\"&gt;Guinigi Tower&lt;/a&gt;, a 45 meters tower that dates from the 1300s. \nThe city is also the birthplace of numerous world-class composers, including &lt;a href=\"Giacomo%20Puccini\"&gt;Giacomo Puccini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alfredo%20Catalani\"&gt;Alfredo Catalani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Boccherini\"&gt;Luigi Boccherini&lt;/a&gt;.\nToponymy.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Romans&lt;/a&gt;, Lucca was known as \"Luca\". From more recent and concrete toponymic studies, the name Lucca has references that lead to \"sacred wood\" (&lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;: \"lucus\"), \"to cut\" (Latin: \"lucare\") and \"luminous space\" (\"leuk\", a term used by the first European populations). The origin apparently refers to a wooded area deforested to make room for light or to a clearing located on a river island of &lt;a href=\"Serchio\"&gt;Serchio&lt;/a&gt; debris, in the middle of wooded areas.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nThe territory of present-day Lucca was certainly inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Etruscans\"&gt;Etruscans&lt;/a&gt;, having also traces of an probable earlier &lt;a href=\"Ligures\"&gt;Ligurian&lt;/a&gt; settlement (called \"Luk\" meaning \"marsh\", which has already been speculated as a possible origin for the city's name), dating from 3rd century BC. However, it was only with the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Romans&lt;/a&gt;, that the area took on the appearance of a real town, becoming a colony in 180 BC, and transformed into a town hall in 89 BC.\nThe rectangular grid of its historical centre preserves the Roman street plan, and the Piazza San Michele occupies the site of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Forum%20%28Roman%29\"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;. Traces of the &lt;a href=\"amphitheatre\"&gt;amphitheatre&lt;/a&gt; may still be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Piazza%20dell%27Anfiteatro%2C%20Lucca\"&gt;Piazza dell'Anfiteatro&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Lucca%20Conference\"&gt;Lucca Conference&lt;/a&gt;, in 56 BC, &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Caesar\"&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pompey\"&gt;Pompey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crassus\"&gt;Crassus&lt;/a&gt; reaffirmed their political alliance known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Triumvirate\"&gt;First Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiddle Ages.\n&lt;a href=\"Frediano\"&gt;Frediano&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=\"bishop%20of%20Lucca\"&gt;bishop of Lucca&lt;/a&gt; in the early sixth century. At one point, Lucca was plundered by &lt;a href=\"Odoacer\"&gt;Odoacer&lt;/a&gt;, the first Germanic King of Italy. Lucca was an important city and fortress even in the sixth century, when &lt;a href=\"Narses\"&gt;Narses&lt;/a&gt; besieged it for several months in 553. From 576 to 797, under the &lt;a href=\"Lombards\"&gt;Lombards&lt;/a&gt;, it was the capital of a duchy, known as \"Ducato di Tuscia\", which included a large part of today's Tuscany and the &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20Viterbo\"&gt;province of Viterbo&lt;/a&gt;, during this time the city also minted its own coins. The &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Face%20of%20Lucca\"&gt;Holy Face of Lucca&lt;/a&gt; (or Volto Santo), a major relic supposedly carved by &lt;a href=\"Nicodemus\"&gt;Nicodemus&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in 742. \nAmong the population that inhabited Lucca in the medieval era, there was also a significant presence of &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt;. The first mention of their presence in the city is from a document from the year 859. The jewish community was led by the &lt;a href=\"Kalonymos%20family\"&gt;Kalonymos family&lt;/a&gt; (which later became a major component of proto-&lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi%20Jews\"&gt;Ashkenazic Jewry&lt;/a&gt;). \nThanks above all to the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Face%20of%20Lucca\"&gt;Holy Face&lt;/a&gt; and to the relics of important saints, such as and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Fridianus\"&gt;Saint Fridianus&lt;/a&gt;, the city was one of the main destinations of the &lt;a href=\"Via%20Francigena\"&gt;Via Francigena&lt;/a&gt;, the major pilgrimage route to Rome from the north. \nLucca became prosperous through the &lt;a href=\"silk\"&gt;silk&lt;/a&gt; trade that began in the eleventh century, and came to rival the silks of &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantium&lt;/a&gt;. During the tenth\u2013eleventh centuries Lucca was the capital of the feudal &lt;a href=\"margraviate%20of%20Tuscany\"&gt;margraviate of Tuscany&lt;/a&gt;, more or less independent but owing nominal allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 1057 &lt;a href=\"Anselm%20of%20Baggio\"&gt;Anselm of Baggio&lt;/a&gt; (later Pope Alexander II) was appointed bishop of Lucca, a position he held also during the papacy. As bishop of Lucca he managed to rebuild the patrimony of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Church&lt;/a&gt; of Lucca, recovering alienated assets, obtaining numerous donations thanks to his prestige, and had the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Lucca\"&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; of the city rebuilt. From 1073 to 1086, the bishop of Lucca was his nephew &lt;a href=\"Anselm%20of%20Lucca\"&gt;Anselm II&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent figure in the Investiture Controversy.\nDuring the High Middle Ages, one of the most illustrious dynasties of Lucca was the noble Allucingoli family, who managed to forge strong ties with the Church. Among the family members were Ubaldo Allucingoli, who was elected to the Papacy as &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Lucius%20III\"&gt;Pope Lucius III&lt;/a&gt; in 1181, and the &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gerardo%20Allucingoli\"&gt;Gerardo Allucingoli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uberto%20Allucingoli\"&gt;Uberto Allucingoli&lt;/a&gt;.\nRepublican period (12th to 19th century).\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Matilda%20of%20Tuscany\"&gt;Matilda of Tuscany&lt;/a&gt;, the city began to constitute itself an independent &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20commune\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; with a charter in 1160. For almost 500 years, Lucca remained an independent republic. There were many minor provinces in the region between southern &lt;a href=\"Liguria\"&gt;Liguria&lt;/a&gt; and northern Tuscany dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Malaspina%20family\"&gt;Malaspina&lt;/a&gt;; Tuscany in this time was a part of feudal Europe. &lt;a href=\"Dante%20Alighieri\"&gt;Dante&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s \"Divine Comedy\" includes many references to the great feudal families who had huge jurisdictions with administrative and judicial rights. Dante spent some of his exile in Lucca.\nIn 1273 and again in 1277, Lucca was ruled by a &lt;a href=\"Guelphs%20and%20Ghibellines\"&gt;Guelph&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"capitano%20del%20popolo\"&gt;capitano del popolo&lt;/a&gt;\" (captain of the people) named &lt;a href=\"Luchetto%20Gattilusio\"&gt;Luchetto Gattilusio&lt;/a&gt;. In 1314, internal discord allowed &lt;a href=\"Uguccione%20della%20Faggiuola\"&gt;Uguccione della Faggiuola&lt;/a&gt; of Pisa to make himself lord of Lucca. The Lucchesi expelled him two years later, and handed over the city to another \"&lt;a href=\"condottiero\"&gt;condottiero&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Castruccio%20Castracani\"&gt;Castruccio Castracani&lt;/a&gt;, under whose rule it became a leading state in central Italy. Lucca rivalled &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt; until Castracani's death in 1328. On 22 and 23 September 1325, in the &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Altopascio\"&gt;battle of Altopascio&lt;/a&gt;, Castracani defeated &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;'s Guelphs. For this he was nominated by &lt;a href=\"Louis%20IV%20the%20Bavarian\"&gt;Louis IV the Bavarian&lt;/a&gt; to become duke of Lucca. Castracani's tomb is in the church of San Francesco. His biography is &lt;a href=\"Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli\"&gt;Machiavelli&lt;/a&gt;'s third famous book on political rule.\nOccupied by the troops of Louis of Bavaria, the city was sold to a rich Genoese, Gherardino Spinola, then seized by John, king of Bohemia. Pawned to the Rossi of Parma, by them it was ceded to &lt;a href=\"Mastino%20II%20della%20Scala\"&gt;Mastino II della Scala&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Verona\"&gt;Verona&lt;/a&gt;, sold to the Florentines, surrendered to the Pisans, and then nominally liberated by the emperor &lt;a href=\"Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles IV&lt;/a&gt; and governed by his vicar.\nIn 1408, Lucca hosted a &lt;a href=\"convocation\"&gt;convocation&lt;/a&gt; organized by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Gregory%20XII\"&gt;Pope Gregory XII&lt;/a&gt; with his cardinals intended to end the schism in the papacy.\nLucca managed, at first as a &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt;, and after 1628 as an &lt;a href=\"oligarchy\"&gt;oligarchy&lt;/a&gt;, to maintain its independence alongside of &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genoa\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt;, and painted the word \"Libertas\" on its banner until the French Revolution in 1789.\nEarly modern period.\nLucca had been the second largest Italian city state (after &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;) with a republican constitution (\"comune\") to remain independent over the centuries.\nBetween 1799 and 1800 it was contended by the French and Austrian armies. Finally the French prevailed and granted a democratic constitution in the 1801. However, already in 1805 the Republic of Lucca was converted into a monarchy by &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;, who installed his sister &lt;a href=\"Elisa%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi&lt;/a&gt; as \"Princess of Lucca\".\nFrom 1815 to 1847 it was a &lt;a href=\"Bourbon%20house\"&gt;Bourbon-Parma&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Lucca\"&gt;duchy&lt;/a&gt;. The only reigning dukes of Lucca were &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Luisa%20of%20Spain%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Lucca\"&gt;Maria Luisa of Spain&lt;/a&gt;, who was succeeded by her son &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Parma\"&gt;Charles II, Duke of Parma&lt;/a&gt; in 1824. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Parma\"&gt;Duchy of Parma&lt;/a&gt; had been assigned for life to &lt;a href=\"Marie%20Louise%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Parma\"&gt;Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma&lt;/a&gt;, the second wife of &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;. In accordance with the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Vienna%20%281815%29\"&gt;Treaty of Vienna (1815)&lt;/a&gt;, upon the death of &lt;a href=\"Marie%20Louise%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Parma\"&gt;Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma&lt;/a&gt; in 1847, Parma reverted to &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Parma\"&gt;Charles II, Duke of Parma&lt;/a&gt;, while Lucca lost independence and was annexed to the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Tuscany\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Tuscany&lt;/a&gt;. As part of Tuscany, it became part of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sardinia\"&gt;Kingdom of Sardinia&lt;/a&gt; in 1860 and finally part of the &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian State&lt;/a&gt; in 1861.\nWorld War II internment camp.\nIn 1942, during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"prisoner-of-war\"&gt;prisoner-of-war&lt;/a&gt; camp was established at the village of &lt;a href=\"Colle%20di%20Compito\"&gt;Colle di Compito&lt;/a&gt;, in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Capannori\"&gt;Capannori&lt;/a&gt;, about from Lucca. Its official number was P.G. (\"prigionieri di guerra\") 60, and it was usually referred to as PG 60 Lucca. Although it never had permanent structures and accommodation consisted of tents in an area prone to flooding, it housed more than 3,000 British and &lt;a href=\"British%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; prisoners of war during the period of its existence. It was handed over to the Germans on 10 September 1943, not long after the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20armistice\"&gt;Italian armistice&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20Social%20Republic\"&gt;Italian Social Republic&lt;/a&gt;, as a &lt;a href=\"puppet%20state\"&gt;puppet state&lt;/a&gt; of the Germans, &lt;a href=\"political%20prisoner\"&gt;political prisoner&lt;/a&gt;s, foreigners, &lt;a href=\"common%20law\"&gt;common law&lt;/a&gt; prisoners and &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;s were interned there, and it functioned as a &lt;a href=\"concentration%20camp\"&gt;concentration camp&lt;/a&gt;. In June 1944 the prisoners were moved to &lt;a href=\"Bagni%20di%20Lucca%23World%20War%20II\"&gt;Bagni di Lucca&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitecture.\nWalls, streets, and squares.\nThe walls encircling the old town remain intact, even as the city expanded and modernized, unusual for cities in the region. Initially built as a defensive &lt;a href=\"rampart%20%28fortification%29\"&gt;rampart&lt;/a&gt;, once the walls lost their military importance they became a pedestrian promenade, the Passeggiata delle Mura Urbane, a street atop the walls linking the bastions. It passes through the Bastions of Santa Croce, San Frediano, San Martino, San Pietro/Battisti, San Salvatore, La Libert\u00e0/Cairoli, San Regolo, San Colombano, Santa Maria, San Paolino/Catalani, and San Donato; and over the gates (Porte): San Donato, Santa Maria, San Jacopo, Elisa, San Pietro, and Sant'Anna. Each of the four principal sides of the structure is lined with a different tree species than the others.\nThe walled city is encircled by Piazzale Boccherini, Viale Lazzaro Papi, Viale Carlo Del Prete, Piazzale Martiri della Libert\u00e0, Via Batoni, Viale Agostino Marti, Viale G. Marconi (\"vide\" &lt;a href=\"Guglielmo%20Marconi\"&gt;Guglielmo Marconi&lt;/a&gt;), Piazza Don A. Mei, Viale &lt;a href=\"Alfredo%20Pacini\"&gt;Pacini&lt;/a&gt;, Viale Giusti, Piazza Curtatone, Piazzale Ricasoli, Viale Ricasoli, Piazza Risorgimento (\"vide\" &lt;a href=\"Risorgimento\"&gt;Risorgimento&lt;/a&gt;), and Viale &lt;a href=\"Giosu%C3%A8%20Carducci\"&gt;Giosu\u00e8 Carducci&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town includes a number of public squares, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Piazza%20dell%27Anfiteatro%2C%20Lucca\"&gt;Piazza dell'Anfiteatro&lt;/a&gt;, site of ancient Roman amphitheater; but also Piazzale Verdi; Piazza Napoleone'; and Piazza San Michele.\nChurches.\nThere are many medieval, a few as old as the eighth century, &lt;a href=\"basilica\"&gt;basilica&lt;/a&gt;-form churches with richly arcaded fa\u00e7ades and campaniles\nCulture.\nLucca is the &lt;a href=\"birthplace\"&gt;birthplace&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Giacomo%20Puccini\"&gt;Giacomo Puccini&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"La%20Boh%C3%A8me\"&gt;La Boh\u00e8me&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Madama%20Butterfly\"&gt;Madama Butterfly&lt;/a&gt;)\", &lt;a href=\"Nicolao%20Dorati\"&gt;Nicolao Dorati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Francesco%20Geminiani\"&gt;Francesco Geminiani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gioseffo%20Guami\"&gt;Gioseffo Guami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luigi%20Boccherini\"&gt;Luigi Boccherini&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alfredo%20Catalani\"&gt;Alfredo Catalani&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the birthplace of artist &lt;a href=\"Benedetto%20Brandimarte\"&gt;Benedetto Brandimarte&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2004, Lucca is home to &lt;a href=\"IMT%20Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Studies%20Lucca\"&gt;IMT Lucca&lt;/a&gt;, a public research institution and a selective graduate school and part of the &lt;a href=\"Superior%20Graduate%20Schools%20in%20Italy\"&gt;Superior Graduate Schools in Italy&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Grandes%20%C3%A9coles\"&gt;Grandes \u00e9coles&lt;/a&gt;\").\nEvents.\nLucca hosts the annual Lucca Summer Festival.
