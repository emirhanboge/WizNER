    "text": "The architecture of Sudan mirrors the &lt;a href=\"Geography\"&gt;geographical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20group\"&gt;ethnic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cultural%20diversity\"&gt;cultural diversity&lt;/a&gt; of the country and its historical periods. The lifestyles and material culture expressed in &lt;a href=\"Human%20settlement\"&gt;human settlements&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Economy\"&gt;economic&lt;/a&gt; activities have been shaped by different regional and environmental conditions. In its &lt;a href=\"Timeline%20of%20Sudanese%20history\"&gt;long documented history&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sudan\"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; has been a land of changing and diverse forms of human &lt;a href=\"civilization\"&gt;civilization&lt;/a&gt; with important influences from foreign cultures.\nThe earliest known architectural structures and &lt;a href=\"urbanization\"&gt;urbanization&lt;/a&gt; go back to the eighth &lt;a href=\"millennium\"&gt;millennium&lt;/a&gt; BCE. Cultural relations with Sudan's northern neighbour of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;Ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, with which it shared long historical periods of mutual influence, brought about both Egyptian as well as distinctly &lt;a href=\"Nubia\"&gt;Nubian&lt;/a&gt; settlements with temples and pyramids that emerged in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kush\"&gt;Kingdom of Kush&lt;/a&gt; and its last capital of &lt;a href=\"Mero%C3%AB\"&gt;Mero\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;. \nFrom around 500 CE until circa 1500 CE, &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Sudan%23Medieval%20Nubia%20%28c.%20350%E2%80%931500%29\"&gt;Christian kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; were thriving in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Nubia\"&gt;Upper Nubia&lt;/a&gt; and southwards along the Nile. They built important cities, known by their florishing culture, with &lt;a href=\"Monastery\"&gt;monasteries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Hall%20of%20Dongola\"&gt;palaces&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"City\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Fortification\"&gt;fortifications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;s, showing influences of &lt;a href=\"Coptic%20history\"&gt;Coptic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; cultures from Egypt and the eastern &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the growing influence of &lt;a href=\"Arabs\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Muslims\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; migrants from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Battle%20of%20Dongola\"&gt;7th century&lt;/a&gt; onwards, the &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Makuria\"&gt;Makuria&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"Baqt\"&gt;Baqt&lt;/a&gt;, a treaty with the Muslim rulers of &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; allowing Muslims to freely trade and travel. This bought about the first establishment of mosques and cemeteries in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Nubia\"&gt;Upper Nubia&lt;/a&gt;, documented from 1317 CE onwards. From about 1500 CE and up to the early 19th century, the Muslim &lt;a href=\"Funj%20Sultanate\"&gt;Sultanates of the Funji&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Darfur\"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; established new kingdoms in the southern and western parts of Sudan. Prosperous cities such as &lt;a href=\"Sennar\"&gt;Sennar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Al%20Fashir\"&gt;Al Fashir&lt;/a&gt; had buildings for &lt;a href=\"Administration%20%28government%29\"&gt;administration&lt;/a&gt; and personal &lt;a href=\"housing\"&gt;housing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Craft\"&gt;crafts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"worship\"&gt;worship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;, - including the &lt;a href=\"Slavery%20in%20Sudan\"&gt;slave trade&lt;/a&gt;. \nLocated on the southern bank of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Nile\"&gt;Blue Nile&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Khartoum\"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt; developed as the centre of the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Sudan\"&gt;Turkish-Egyptian state&lt;/a&gt;, but was largely destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Mahdist%20State\"&gt;Mahdi&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s followers in 1885, who established their &lt;a href=\"Capital%20city\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Omdurman\"&gt;Omdurman&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"White%20Nile\"&gt;White Nile&lt;/a&gt;. In the early 1900s, &lt;a href=\"Khartoum\"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;, was rebuilt by the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Egyptian%20Sudan\"&gt;British administration&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener\"&gt;Lord Kitchener&lt;/a&gt;, following &lt;a href=\"Technical%20standard\"&gt;standards&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Modern%20architecture\"&gt;modern European city&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, greater Khartoum is a &lt;a href=\"metropolis\"&gt;metropolis&lt;/a&gt; with an estimated &lt;a href=\"population\"&gt;population&lt;/a&gt; of almost six million people, consisting of Khartoum proper, linked by &lt;a href=\"Bridge\"&gt;bridges&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Nile\"&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"White%20Nile\"&gt;White Nile&lt;/a&gt; with the cities of &lt;a href=\"Khartoum%20North\"&gt;Khartoum North&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Omdurman\"&gt;Omdurman&lt;/a&gt; to the West. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Rural%20area\"&gt;rural&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"landscape\"&gt;landscape&lt;/a&gt; of Sudan is still largely characterized by &lt;a href=\"Tradition\"&gt;traditional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Architecture%20of%20Africa\"&gt;African architecture&lt;/a&gt;, but also has undergone important changes in the development of settlements, &lt;a href=\"infrastructure\"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; and corresponding architecture during the 19th and 20th centuries.\nEarly historical periods.\nPrehistory.\nBy the eighth millennium\u00a0BCE, people of a &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; culture had settled into a sedentary way of life in the Nile valley in fortified &lt;a href=\"mud-brick\"&gt;mud-brick&lt;/a&gt; villages, where they supplemented &lt;a href=\"hunting\"&gt;hunting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; on the Nile with &lt;a href=\"grain\"&gt;grain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Harvest\"&gt;harvesting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"herding\"&gt;herding&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn eastern &lt;a href=\"Sudan\"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Butana%20Group\"&gt;Butana Group&lt;/a&gt; appeared around 4000 &lt;a href=\"Common%20Era\"&gt;BCE&lt;/a&gt;. Not much is known about settlement patterns, but some sites are almost 10 &lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;hectare&lt;/a&gt; large, indicating longer occupations. The people of the Butana Group lived in small, round &lt;a href=\"hut\"&gt;hut&lt;/a&gt;s. Not many &lt;a href=\"Cemetery\"&gt;cemeteries&lt;/a&gt; are known, but people were most often buried in a contracted position.\nSettlements of Ancient Egypt in Nubia.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Buhen\"&gt;Buhen&lt;/a&gt; was an &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Egypt\"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian settlement near today's city of &lt;a href=\"Wadi%20Halfa\"&gt;Wadi Halfa&lt;/a&gt; in Sudan's &lt;a href=\"Northern%20state%2C%20Sudan\"&gt;Northern State&lt;/a&gt;. It is known for its large &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt;, probably constructed during the rule of &lt;a href=\"Senusret%20III\"&gt;Senusret III&lt;/a&gt; around 1860 BCE (&lt;a href=\"Twelfth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;12th Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;). Its &lt;a href=\"fortification\"&gt;fortification&lt;/a&gt;s included a &lt;a href=\"moat\"&gt;moat&lt;/a&gt; three meters deep, &lt;a href=\"Drawbridge\"&gt;drawbridges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;bastions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buttress\"&gt;buttresses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20wall\"&gt;ramparts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battlement\"&gt;battlements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrowslit\"&gt;loopholes&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;. The outer &lt;a href=\"wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt; included an area between the two walls pierced with a double row of &lt;a href=\"Arrowslit\"&gt;arrow loops&lt;/a&gt;, allowing both standing and kneeling &lt;a href=\"Archery\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt; to fire at the same time. In 1962, an &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;archaeological&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Exploration\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; of Buhen revealed elements like &lt;a href=\"slag\"&gt;slag&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt; process that belonged to an ancient &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt; factory. Buhen also had a &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Horus\"&gt;Horus&lt;/a&gt;, built by &lt;a href=\"Hatshepsut\"&gt;Hatshepsut&lt;/a&gt;. Walls of this temple, along with architectural elements from the &lt;a href=\"Semna%20%28Nubia%29\"&gt;Semna&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cataracts%20of%20the%20Nile\"&gt;cataract&lt;/a&gt; and other locations were re-erected in the museum garden of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Sudan\"&gt;National Museum of Sudan&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"Flood\"&gt;flooding&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Nasser\"&gt;Lake Nasser&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kingdom of Kush.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kush\"&gt;Kingdom of Kush&lt;/a&gt; (about 950 BCE\u2013CE 350), when the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Kush\"&gt;monarchs of Kush&lt;/a&gt; ruled their northern neighbour Egypt as &lt;a href=\"pharao\"&gt;pharao&lt;/a&gt;s for over a century and a strong Egyptian influence was present in &lt;a href=\"Nubia\"&gt;Nubia&lt;/a&gt;n culture, important cities with &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s were built, such as the city of &lt;a href=\"Naqa\"&gt;Naqa&lt;/a&gt; with its temples dedicated to ancient deities &lt;a href=\"Amun\"&gt;Amun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apedemak\"&gt;Apedemak&lt;/a&gt;. Another building in the same place is a small temple called The Roman Kiosk with indigenous Nubian as well as &lt;a href=\"Hellenistic\"&gt;Hellenistic&lt;/a&gt; elements. \nFurther examples of ancient &lt;a href=\"Nubian%20architecture\"&gt;Nubian architecture&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Rock-cut%20architecture\"&gt;rock-cut&lt;/a&gt; temples, big &lt;a href=\"mudbrick\"&gt;mudbrick&lt;/a&gt; buildings with temples called \"deffufa\", graves with stoned walls or dwellings made of mudbricks, wood and stone floors, palaces and well laid-out roads. &lt;a href=\"Archaeological%20excavation\"&gt;Archaeological campaigns&lt;/a&gt; have brought to light the remnants of Nubian cities, such as the Royal City of &lt;a href=\"Mero%C3%AB\"&gt;Mero\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;, where the so-called 'Roman baths', were characterised as \"an outstanding example of cultural transfer between the African kingdom and the &lt;a href=\"Greco-Roman%20world\"&gt;Greco-Roman culture&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;.\" Among Sudan's &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Sites&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nubian%20pyramids\"&gt;Nubian pyramids&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mero%C3%AB\"&gt;Mero\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; are probably the best known architectural remnants of this historical period.\nMedieval Nubia.\nIn &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Sudan%23Medieval%20Nubia%20%28c.%20350%E2%80%931500%29\"&gt;medieval Nubia&lt;/a&gt; (c. 500\u20131500 CE), the inhabitants of the &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms &lt;a href=\"Makuria\"&gt;Makuria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nobadia\"&gt;Nobadia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alodia\"&gt;Alodia&lt;/a&gt; built distinct forms of architecture in their cities, such as the &lt;a href=\"Faras%20Cathedral\"&gt;Faras Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; with elaborate friezes and wall paintings, the Great Monastery of St Anthony or the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Hall%20of%20Dongola\"&gt;Throne Hall&lt;/a&gt; of the Makurian kings, a massive defence-like building, in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dongola\"&gt;Old Dongola&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these buildings were excavated and documented, before they were submerged in the waters of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Nasser\"&gt;Lake Nasser&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960s and 70s.\nArrival of Islam and Arabization.\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic kingdoms were established in the southern and western parts of Sudan \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Funj%20Sultanate\"&gt;Funj Sultanate&lt;/a&gt; with its capital in &lt;a href=\"Sennar\"&gt;Sennar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Darfur\"&gt;Sultanate of Darfur&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Al-Fashir\"&gt;Al-Fashir&lt;/a&gt;. The changes in religion and society at large marked a long period of gradual &lt;a href=\"Islamization\"&gt;Islamization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arabization%23Arabization%20in%20Sudan\"&gt;Arabization&lt;/a&gt; in Sudan. These sultanates and their societies existed until the Sudan was conquered through the &lt;a href=\"Egyptian%20conquest%20of%20Sudan%20%281820%E2%80%931824%29\"&gt;Ottoman Egyptian invasion&lt;/a&gt; in 1820, and, in the case of Darfur, even until 1916.\nMajor cultural changes of this period were the adoption by growing numbers of people of the &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic religion and the use of the &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20Language\"&gt;Arabic language&lt;/a&gt;, with the building of &lt;a href=\"mosque\"&gt;mosque&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Madrasa\"&gt;Islamic schools&lt;/a&gt; as elements of social life. Other cultural developments were reported by foreign visitors such as &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Cailliaud\"&gt;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cailliaud&lt;/a&gt; and included the architecture of towns and buildings.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Sudan\"&gt;Turkish-Egyptian rule&lt;/a&gt; (1821-1885), Turks, Egyptians, British and other foreign inhabitants of Khartoum expanded the city from a military &lt;a href=\"Military%20camp\"&gt;encampment&lt;/a&gt; to a regional centre with hundreds of brick-built houses, official buildings like the first governor's palace, the \"mudiriya\" (government offices) and several foreign consulates. In 1829, the first mosque was erected in Khartoum under governor-general Ali Khurshid Agha, who also had a &lt;a href=\"Shipyard\"&gt;dockyard&lt;/a&gt; and new military &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; built. \nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Khartoum\"&gt;General Gordon's troups&lt;/a&gt; in 1885, the &lt;a href=\"Mahdist%20State\"&gt;Mahdist state&lt;/a&gt; (1885\u20131899) built important architectural monuments in &lt;a href=\"Omdurman\"&gt;Omdurman&lt;/a&gt;, the country's capital during this period. Today, the reconstructed &lt;a href=\"The%20Mahdi%27s%20tomb\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20Ahmad\"&gt;Muhammad Ahmad&lt;/a&gt;, known as al-Mahdi, the former residence of his successor &lt;a href=\"Abdallahi%20ibn%20Muhammad\"&gt;Abdallahi ibn Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;, now the &lt;a href=\"Khalifa%20House%20Museum\"&gt;Khalifa House Museum&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Abdul Qayyum Gate and some remnants of the fortifications, known as \"Al Tabia\", bear witness to the Islamic tradition of Omdurman. Other characteristic buildings include mosques and graves of important religious leaders, such as Sheikh Hamed el Nil. Furthermore, \"Souk Omdurman\" is an important traditional market\".\"\nTraditional architecture.\nTraditional homes and other structures of &lt;a href=\"vernacular%20architecture\"&gt;vernacular architecture&lt;/a&gt; in large parts of the country have been built using locally available materials, such as &lt;a href=\"cow%20dung\"&gt;cow dung&lt;/a&gt;, mudbricks, stones or trees and other plants. The buildings are often embellished with painted ornaments, reflecting the local culture. This type of &lt;a href=\"Rectangle\"&gt;rectangular&lt;/a&gt; or square house is typically constructed by the future inhabitants themselves, relying on helping hands from the community. \nIn the southern parts of the country, where there is more rainfall and vegetation than in the North, round &lt;a href=\"hut\"&gt;hut&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"Thatching\"&gt;thatched&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cone\"&gt;conical&lt;/a&gt; roofs are widespread. These \"&lt;a href=\"tukul\"&gt;tukul&lt;/a&gt;\" huts are traditionally made of dried mud, grass, stalks and wooden poles. Also, the various &lt;a href=\"Nomad\"&gt;(semi-)nomadic&lt;/a&gt; peoples who live in Sudan, such as the &lt;a href=\"Beja%20people\"&gt;Beja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baggara%20Arabs\"&gt;Baggara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rashaida%20people\"&gt;Rachaida&lt;/a&gt; or others have developed mobile camps and often still today live in &lt;a href=\"tent\"&gt;tent&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTurkish architecture in Suakin.\nLong before the Turkish invasion of Sudan in the early 1820s, the city of &lt;a href=\"Suakin\"&gt;Suakin&lt;/a&gt; on Sudan's &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sea\"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast had been developed as an important port and commercial centre by its Turkish and Arab inhabitants. After the construction of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Sudan\"&gt;Port Sudan&lt;/a&gt; as a modern city and harbour in 1909, Suakin fell into disrepair, with only some ruins of its former buildings left. In his book on \"The Coral Buildings of Suakin\", Jean-Pierre Greenlaw, a British art teacher, who had set up the School of Design in Khartoum, documented the former state of the town and gave the following description:\nOther buildings bearing witness to Turkish cultural influence in Sudan are the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20graves%20%28Khartoum%29\"&gt;graves of Ottoman rulers&lt;/a&gt; with characteristic &lt;a href=\"qubba\"&gt;qubba&lt;/a&gt; domes in today's Baladiya Street in Khartoum.\nAnglo-Egyptian rule in the 20th century.\nAfter the British Imperial Army under &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener\"&gt;Lord Kitchener&lt;/a&gt; had defeated the &lt;a href=\"Mahdist%20State\"&gt;Mahdist State&lt;/a&gt; with its capital in Omdurman in 1898, the urban district of downtown Khartoum was developed according to &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20architecture\"&gt;colonial&lt;/a&gt; rules of space &lt;a href=\"zoning\"&gt;zoning&lt;/a&gt; in a series of &lt;a href=\"Union%20Jack\"&gt;Union Jack&lt;/a&gt; patterns. British &lt;a href=\"urban%20planner\"&gt;urban planner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"William%20McLean%20%28civil%20servant%29\"&gt;William Mclean&lt;/a&gt; designed the first master plan for Khartoum, and it was once called \"the jewel in the crown\" of British colonies in Africa.\nNew buildings in European styles were built between 1900 and 1912, such as the Government House (now the President's Palace) and other government buildings along Nile Street. Important buildings for education included the &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Memorial%20College\"&gt;Gordon Memorial College&lt;/a&gt;, which later became the main building of today's &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Khartoum\"&gt;University of Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href=\"Faculty%20of%20Medicine%2C%20University%20of%20Khartoum\"&gt;School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Comboni%20College%20of%20Science%20%26amp%3B%20Technology\"&gt;Comboni College&lt;/a&gt;. In 1902, the first school for girls was opened, which still exists as &lt;a href=\"Unity%20High%20School%20%28Sudan%29\"&gt;Unity High School&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe al-Kabir mosque for &lt;a href=\"Jumu%27ah\"&gt;Friday prayers&lt;/a&gt; in Khartoum, built in Egyptian style, was inaugurated, when &lt;a href=\"Khedivate%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;Khedive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abbas%20II%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;Abbas Pasha Helmy&lt;/a&gt; visited Sudan on 4 December 1901. The former &lt;a href=\"Anglicanism\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; All Saints cathedral (now Republican Palace Museum) and the Catholic &lt;a href=\"St.%20Matthew%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Khartoum\"&gt;St. Matthew's cathedral&lt;/a&gt; were both completed around 1910 in &lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;neo-Romanesque&lt;/a&gt; style. In 1926, the Ohel Shlomo synagogue was built in &lt;a href=\"Sephardi%20Jews\"&gt;Sephardic&lt;/a&gt; style on former Victoria Avenue, now Al-Qasr Street, for the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Sudan\"&gt;Jewish community&lt;/a&gt; of greater Khartoum.\nFor visitors, Khartoum also offered accommodation in several hotels, such as the Gordon Hotel and later, the &lt;a href=\"Acropole%20Hotel\"&gt;Acropole hotel&lt;/a&gt;, run since 1952 by &lt;a href=\"Greeks%20in%20Sudan\"&gt;Greek owners&lt;/a&gt;. Other urban structures were &lt;a href=\"marketplace\"&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"Souq%20al%20Arabi\"&gt;Souq al-Arabi&lt;/a&gt;, banks and offices, as well as the infrastructure for &lt;a href=\"Rail%20transport%20in%20Sudan\"&gt;railway services&lt;/a&gt; and the first &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Nile%20Road%20and%20Railway%20Bridge\"&gt;bridges&lt;/a&gt; spanning the Nile. (The &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Nile%20Road%20and%20Railway%20Bridge\"&gt;Blue Nile Bridge&lt;/a&gt; opened in 1909 and &lt;a href=\"Omdurman%20Bridge\"&gt;Omdurman Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in 1926.) In Khartoum North, a large &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;, today called &lt;a href=\"Kobar%20Prison\"&gt;Kobar prison&lt;/a&gt; and still in use, was established in 1903 and gave its name to the adjacent neighbourhood. Even though these changes were made by and for foreigners and excluded most Sudanese inhabitants, the newly independent &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Sudan%20%281956-1969%29\"&gt;Republic of Sudan&lt;/a&gt; \"inherited a fairly efficient system of education, public administration, transportation, recreation and other amenities.\"\n&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Sudan\"&gt;Provincial towns and cities&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Kassala\"&gt;Kassala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"El-Gadarif\"&gt;El-Gadarif&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"El-Obeid\"&gt;El-Obeid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Port%20Sudan\"&gt;Port Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shendi\"&gt;Shendi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atbara\"&gt;Atbara&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Wad%20Madani\"&gt;Wad Madani&lt;/a&gt; also underwent important changes necessary for colonial rule, with modern buildings, &lt;a href=\"Transport%20in%20Sudan\"&gt;long distance roads&lt;/a&gt; and other infrastructure, such as a &lt;a href=\"Rail%20transport%20in%20Sudan%23History\"&gt;railway system&lt;/a&gt; linking the major economic centres.\nModern architecture after independence.\nIn the first years after independence, new buildings, for example the Examination Hall of the University of Khartoum, were designed by foreign architects, such as Peter Muller, George Stefanidis, Alick Potter and Miles Danbi. A Faculty of Architecture was opened at the University of Khartoum in 1957, with Alick Potter as first Head of Department and professor of architecture.\nFrom the 1960s onwards, Sudanese architects &lt;a href=\"Abdel%20Moneim%20Mustafa\"&gt;Abdel Moneim Mustafa&lt;/a&gt; and Hamid El Khawad, who had returned from their studies in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, designed numerous contemporary Sudanese projects. These include the University of Khartoum's Lecture Theatre, buildings for the Department of Biochemistry - Faculty of Agriculture, as well as the Structures Laboratory of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture.\nOther buildings by Abdel Moneim Mustafa are the headquarters for the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20Bank%20for%20Economic%20Development%20in%20Africa\"&gt;Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa&lt;/a&gt;, El-Ikhwa commercial building, El-Turabi primary school and apartment buildings in Khartoum's central business district. Among the first graduates of the Faculty of Architecture were Omer Al Agraa and El Amin Mudather, who designed the university's building for the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.\nPeter Muller, an &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;n architect, designed the new &lt;a href=\"Institute%20of%20technology\"&gt;Polytechnic&lt;/a&gt; complex, which later became the &lt;a href=\"Sudan%20University%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology\"&gt;Sudan University of Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt;. The campus includes several multi-storey teaching blocks, a library, workshops, hostels, staff houses, and a stadium. He also designed the &lt;a href=\"Bata%20Corporation\"&gt;Bata Shoe&lt;/a&gt; factory in the industrial area of Khartoum North.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Omdurman\"&gt;Omdurman&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Al-Nilin%20Mosque\"&gt;Al-Nilin Mosque&lt;/a&gt; (Mosque of the two Niles), with its distinct dome and devoid of supporting pillars inside, located at the confluence of the White and Blue Nile, was inaugurated in the mid-1970s. Close to this, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20of%20Sudan\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; building was designed in the style of &lt;a href=\"brutalist%20architecture\"&gt;brutalist architecture&lt;/a&gt;, and \"reminiscent of classical temple architecture\", by &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n architect &lt;a href=\"Cezar%20L%C4%83z%C4%83rescu\"&gt;Cezar L\u0103z\u0103rescu&lt;/a&gt;, and completed in 1978. As one of several universities in Omdurman, the campus of &lt;a href=\"Ahfad%20University%20for%20Women\"&gt;Ahfad University for Women&lt;/a&gt; was built in 1966.\nContemporary architecture in the 21-st century.\nIn the early 21st century, major new buildings in Khartoum are the &lt;a href=\"Hotel%20rating\"&gt;5-star&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Corinthia%20Hotel%20Khartoum\"&gt;Corinthia Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, opened in 2009 and financed by the Libyan government, or the &lt;a href=\"NTC%20Tower\"&gt;Telecommunications Tower&lt;/a&gt;, also of 2009. &lt;a href=\"El%20Mek%20Nimr%20Bridge\"&gt;El Mek Nimr Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, finished in 2007, spans the Blue Nile between downtown Khartoum and Khartoum North, and &lt;a href=\"Tuti%20Bridge\"&gt;Tuti Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be the first &lt;a href=\"suspension%20bridge\"&gt;suspension bridge&lt;/a&gt; in Sudan. \nIn 2010, the &lt;a href=\"Salam%20Centre%20for%20Cardiac%20Surgery\"&gt;Salam Centre for Cardiac Surgery&lt;/a&gt;, designed by an Italian company, was completed and won the 2013 &lt;a href=\"Aga%20Khan%20Award%20for%20Architecture\"&gt;Aga Khan Award for Architecture&lt;/a&gt;. The same year, the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Nile%20Petroleum%20Oil%20Company%20Tower\"&gt;Greater Nile Petroleum Oil Company Tower&lt;/a&gt; was completed by a company based in &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Dhabi\"&gt;Abu Dhabi&lt;/a&gt;. The main building of the &lt;a href=\"Open%20University%20of%20Sudan\"&gt;Open University of Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, opened in 2004 in the Khartoum suburb of Arkaweet, is another example for contemporary architecture in the capital."
