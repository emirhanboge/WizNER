    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Somerset\"&gt;Somerset&lt;/a&gt; is a county in the south west of &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. It has a varied cultural tradition ranging from the &lt;a href=\"Matter%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Arthurian legends&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"The%20Wurzels\"&gt;The Wurzels&lt;/a&gt;, a band specialising in &lt;a href=\"Scrumpy%20and%20Western\"&gt;Scrumpy and Western&lt;/a&gt; music.\nArt, music, film and literature.\nTraditional folk music, both song and dance, was important in Somerset's agrarian communities. Somerset songs were collected by &lt;a href=\"Cecil%20Sharp\"&gt;Cecil Sharp&lt;/a&gt; and incorporated into a number of works including &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Holst\"&gt;Holst's&lt;/a&gt; \"A Somerset Rhapsody\". &lt;a href=\"Halsway%20Manor\"&gt;Halsway Manor&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Williton\"&gt;Williton&lt;/a&gt; is an international centre for folk music. The tradition continues today with groups such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Wurzels\"&gt;The Wurzels&lt;/a&gt;, who specialise in &lt;a href=\"Scrumpy%20and%20Western\"&gt;Scrumpy and Western&lt;/a&gt; music. The number of &lt;a href=\"Morris%20dance\"&gt;Morris dance&lt;/a&gt; sides declined drastically following the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, but saw a resurgence during the 1950s, and Morris dancing is now a common sight at events throughout the summer.\n&lt;a href=\"William%20Wordsworth\"&gt;Wordsworth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge\"&gt;Coleridge&lt;/a&gt; wrote while staying in &lt;a href=\"Coleridge%20Cottage\"&gt;Coleridge Cottage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Stowey\"&gt;Nether Stowey&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe writer &lt;a href=\"Evelyn%20Waugh\"&gt;Evelyn Waugh&lt;/a&gt; spent his last years in the village of &lt;a href=\"Combe%20Florey\"&gt;Combe Florey&lt;/a&gt;. The novelist &lt;a href=\"John%20Cowper%20Powys\"&gt;John Cowper Powys&lt;/a&gt; (1872\u20131963) lived in the Somerset village of &lt;a href=\"Montacute\"&gt;Montacute&lt;/a&gt; from 1885 until 1894 and his novels \"Wood and Stone\" (1915) and \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Glastonbury%20Romance\"&gt;A Glastonbury Romance&lt;/a&gt;\" (1932) are set in Somerset. His brothers, &lt;a href=\"T.%20F.%20Powys\"&gt;T. F. Powys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Llewelyn%20Powys\"&gt;Llewelyn Powys&lt;/a&gt;, were also successful writers.\nMany traditional rural trades such as basket making have survived, and many other crafts such as jewelry, leatherwork and pottery can be found at studios around the county.\nAn annual competition for the &lt;a href=\"Bard%20of%20Bath\"&gt;Bard of Bath&lt;/a&gt; aims to find &lt;a href=\"Bath%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Bath&lt;/a&gt;'s best poet, singer or storyteller. The Bard uses the title to develop artistic projects in the area and leads evening bardic walks around the city. The title resurrects an Iron-Age Celtic Druid tradition where &lt;a href=\"Druids\"&gt;Druids&lt;/a&gt; were the law-makers, judges and ceremonial leaders, &lt;a href=\"Ovates\"&gt;Ovates&lt;/a&gt; were mediums, healers and prophets and &lt;a href=\"Bards\"&gt;Bards&lt;/a&gt; were poets, musicians and history-keepers. All of them held high status and a place in mystical/religious circles.\nTheatres.\n&lt;a href=\"Bath%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Bath&lt;/a&gt; has the greatest number of theatres in the county. The oldest is the &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Bath\"&gt;Theatre Royal&lt;/a&gt; which was built in 1720 by Thomas Greenway, and was &lt;a href=\"Beau%20Nash\"&gt;Beau Nash&lt;/a&gt;'s first house: The theatre, along with the neighbouring Garrick's Head public house, is a &lt;a href=\"Grade%20II%2A%20listed%20building\"&gt;Grade II* listed building&lt;/a&gt; and is considered a prime example of &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20architecture\"&gt;Georgian architecture&lt;/a&gt;. The auditorium has tiers of ornate plasterwork, with sumptuous red and gilt decoration, and a majestic \"trompe l'oeil\" ceiling and glittering chandelier. It was extensively renovated in 1982, and refurbished in 1999 and now provides a 900-seat auditorium. The &lt;a href=\"Ustinov%20Studio\"&gt;Ustinov Studio&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"studio%20theatre\"&gt;studio theatre&lt;/a&gt; is the Theatre Royal's second space, built in 1997 at the rear of the building on Monmouth Street. It is named after the actor &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Ustinov\"&gt;Peter Ustinov&lt;/a&gt;. It is the home of Britain's largest annual international festival of adult puppetry, and a venue for an eclectic range of drama, dance and classical music. In 2006 it closed for a \u00a31.5million, 15-month refurbishment undertaken by &lt;a href=\"Haworth%20Tompkins\"&gt;Haworth Tompkins&lt;/a&gt;. Also connected to the Theatre Royal is &lt;a href=\"The%20egg%2C%20Bath\"&gt;the egg&lt;/a&gt; which was built specifically for the use of young people. It was converted from a former cinema by architects &lt;a href=\"Haworth%20Tompkins\"&gt;Haworth Tompkins&lt;/a&gt;. The Grade II &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20architecture\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; building houses the eponymous 'egg'-shaped auditorium, around which an arts cafe, rooftop rehearsal space and basement technical workshop are arranged. The idea was supported by the children's author &lt;a href=\"Bel%20Mooney\"&gt;Bel Mooney&lt;/a&gt;. It opened in October 2005. In 2007, the &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Hall%20Company\"&gt;Peter Hall Company&lt;/a&gt; made use of the space in order to stage a production of &lt;a href=\"George%20Orwell\"&gt;George Orwell&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Farm\"&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/a&gt;. The auditorium is unique in the UK enabling both fully day-lit or blacked out theatre and is usable end-on, in the round, flat floor and traverse.\nIn 2004, the Next Stage Theatre Company took possession of a grade II &lt;a href=\"listed%20building\"&gt;listed building&lt;/a&gt; in Bath originally built as a Congregational hall in 1797, which had been used by The People's Mission until 1998, and began building work to convert it into the &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Theatre\"&gt;Mission Theatre&lt;/a&gt;. It is now owned by the &lt;a href=\"Bath%20and%20North%20East%20Somerset\"&gt;Bath and North East Somerset&lt;/a&gt; Council, which has granted a lease to occupy and use the building as a 100-seat theatre, arts centre and multi-purpose facility for community activities. On the first floor there is a small 30-seat theatre (The Theatre Upstairs) and a Bistro open during the day and providing meals before performances in the theatre. The &lt;a href=\"Rondo%20Theatre\"&gt;Rondo Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, which was established in 1989, is located in the former church hall of St. Saviours Church, &lt;a href=\"Larkhall%2C%20Bath\"&gt;Larkhall&lt;/a&gt;. The building, purchased in 1976 by Doreen and Wilf Williams, has been converted into a 105-seat theatre. The facility received extensive renovations and upgrades after the receipt of lottery grants in 1996 and 2003.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Blakehay%20Theatre%2C%20Weston-super-Mare\"&gt;The Blakehay Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Weston-super-Mare\"&gt;Weston-super-Mare&lt;/a&gt; was originally built in 1850 as Wadham Street Baptist Church. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; the theatre was hit by incendiary bombs. After the war it was rebuilt inside the original &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20architecture\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; shell. In 1985 the building ceased to be a place of worship. In 1986 the Blakehay was saved from demolition by the Weston-super-Mare Building Trust and run by the Civic Society. In September 2004 Weston Town Council purchased the theatre for \u00a3195,000. Also in Weston is &lt;a href=\"The%20Playhouse%2C%20Weston-super-Mare\"&gt;The Playhouse&lt;/a&gt; a 664-seat theatre that hosts a largely entertainment based programme of shows all year round including &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ballet\"&gt;ballet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"comedy\"&gt;comedy&lt;/a&gt;, music and &lt;a href=\"pantomime\"&gt;pantomime&lt;/a&gt; performances. In 1946, an old &lt;a href=\"Market%20%28place%29\"&gt;market&lt;/a&gt; building, designed by local architect &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Price\"&gt;Hans Price&lt;/a&gt;, was converted into a 500-seat theatre. For the next 18 years this theatre, The Playhouse, provided the town with a great variety of entertainment and played host to stars including &lt;a href=\"Frankie%20Howerd\"&gt;Frankie Howerd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Monkhouse\"&gt;Bob Monkhouse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ken%20Dodd\"&gt;Ken Dodd&lt;/a&gt;. On 21 August 1964, a fire destroyed most of the theatre and the unsafe structure had to be demolished. In 1969, at a cost of \u00a3230,000 a new theatre opened and has been in continuous use ever since. The stage measures by and can be extended by covering the &lt;a href=\"orchestra%20pit\"&gt;orchestra pit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Brewhouse%20Theatre\"&gt;Brewhouse Theatre&lt;/a&gt; on the banks of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Tone\"&gt;River Tone&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Taunton\"&gt;Taunton&lt;/a&gt;, opened in March 1977, and now offers a 350-seat auditorium and supporting studio and exhibition spaces. &lt;a href=\"Strode%20Theatre\"&gt;Strode Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Street%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Street&lt;/a&gt; is part of &lt;a href=\"Strode%20College\"&gt;Strode College&lt;/a&gt; and provides rehearsal and drama space for students from the college. It opened on 5 October 1963 with a performance by the &lt;a href=\"Bournemouth%20Symphony%20Orchestra\"&gt;Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two theatres in &lt;a href=\"Frome\"&gt;Frome&lt;/a&gt;: The \"Memorial Theatre\" was built in 1924 in memory of the fallen of the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, whilst the 240-seat \"Merlin Theatre\" is part of the Community College campus.\nFestivals.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Glastonbury%20Festival\"&gt;Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts&lt;/a&gt; takes place most years in &lt;a href=\"Pilton%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Pilton&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Shepton%20Mallet\"&gt;Shepton Mallet&lt;/a&gt;, attracting over 170,000 music and culture lovers and entertainers from around the world. The &lt;a href=\"Big%20Green%20Gathering\"&gt;Big Green Gathering&lt;/a&gt; was held in Somerset on five occasions between 2002 and 2007.\nThe annual &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Literature%20Festival\"&gt;Bath Literature Festival&lt;/a&gt; is one of several local festivals in the county which include the &lt;a href=\"Frome%20Festival\"&gt;Frome Festival&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Trowbridge%20Village%20Pump%20Festival\"&gt;Trowbridge Village Pump Festival&lt;/a&gt;, which, despite its name, is held at &lt;a href=\"Farleigh%20Hungerford\"&gt;Farleigh Hungerford&lt;/a&gt; in Somerset.\nThe annual circuit of &lt;a href=\"West%20Country%20Carnival\"&gt;West Country Carnival&lt;/a&gt;s is held in a variety of Somerset towns during the autumn, forming a major regional festival, and the largest Festival of Lights in Europe. It is an annual celebration featuring a &lt;a href=\"parade\"&gt;parade&lt;/a&gt; of illuminated &lt;a href=\"Float%20%28parade%29\"&gt;floats&lt;/a&gt; (termed \"carts\" locally), in the English &lt;a href=\"West%20Country\"&gt;West Country&lt;/a&gt;. The celebration dates back to the &lt;a href=\"Gunpowder%20Plot\"&gt;Gunpowder Plot&lt;/a&gt; of 1605. The series of parades in each town now form a major regional festival. Some &lt;a href=\"Float%20%28parade%29\"&gt;carts&lt;/a&gt; cost in excess of \u00a320,000 to build and are the result of thousands of man hours work throughout the year. The event's purpose, as it has always been from the start, is to raise thousands of pounds for local &lt;a href=\"Charitable%20organization\"&gt;charities&lt;/a&gt; from money collection carts in the two-hour procession. In several villages &lt;a href=\"Punkie%20Night\"&gt;Punkie Night&lt;/a&gt; is celebrated each October.\nMany villages had &lt;a href=\"Friendly%20Society\"&gt;Friendly Societies&lt;/a&gt; or Clubs between the late 18th and early 20th centuries. The use of &lt;a href=\"Friendly%20Society%20Brasses\"&gt;Friendly Society Brasses&lt;/a&gt; as emblems was particularly prevalent in Somerset and the surrounding counties.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Weston-super-Mare%20Sand%20Sculpture%20Festival\"&gt;Weston-super-Mare Sand Sculpture Festival&lt;/a&gt; is held annually on the beach at &lt;a href=\"Weston-super-Mare\"&gt;Weston-super-Mare&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bridgwater%20Science%20Festival\"&gt;Bridgwater Science Festival&lt;/a&gt; is held each year in the Town Hall and other venues in &lt;a href=\"Bridgwater\"&gt;Bridgwater&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegends and religion.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Matter%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Arthurian legend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avalon\"&gt;Avalon&lt;/a&gt; became associated with &lt;a href=\"Glastonbury%20Tor\"&gt;Glastonbury Tor&lt;/a&gt; when monks at &lt;a href=\"Glastonbury%20Abbey\"&gt;Glastonbury Abbey&lt;/a&gt; claimed to have discovered the bones of &lt;a href=\"King%20Arthur\"&gt;King Arthur&lt;/a&gt; and his queen. What is more certain is that Glastonbury was an important religious centre by 700. It claims to be \"the oldest above-ground Christian church in the World\" by dating the founding of the community of monks to AD 63, the year of the legendary visit of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20of%20Arimathea\"&gt;Joseph of Arimathea&lt;/a&gt;, who was supposed to have brought the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Grail\"&gt;Holy Grail&lt;/a&gt; to England.\nDuring the Middle Ages there were also important religious sites at &lt;a href=\"Woodspring%20Priory\"&gt;Woodspring Priory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muchelney%20Abbey\"&gt;Muchelney Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. The present &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells\"&gt;Diocese of Bath and Wells&lt;/a&gt; covers Somerset and a small area of Dorset. The &lt;a href=\"cathedra\"&gt;Episcopal seat&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells\"&gt;Bishop of Bath and Wells&lt;/a&gt; is now located in the &lt;a href=\"Wells%20Cathedral\"&gt;Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Wells%2C%20Somerset\"&gt;Wells&lt;/a&gt;, having been previously based at &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Abbey\"&gt;Bath Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. Before the &lt;a href=\"English%20Reformation\"&gt;English Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, it was a Roman Catholic diocese. There is also a &lt;a href=\"Benedictine\"&gt;Benedictine&lt;/a&gt; monastery, Saint Gregory's Abbey (commonly known as &lt;a href=\"Downside%20Abbey\"&gt;Downside Abbey&lt;/a&gt;), at &lt;a href=\"Stratton-on-the-Fosse\"&gt;Stratton-on-the-Fosse&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Cistercian\"&gt;Cistercian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cleeve%20Abbey\"&gt;Cleeve Abbey&lt;/a&gt; near the village of &lt;a href=\"Washford\"&gt;Washford&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Culbone%20Church\"&gt;Culbone Church&lt;/a&gt; is the smallest &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England%20parish%20church\"&gt;parish church&lt;/a&gt; still holding services.\nMany legends exist about Somerset. The &lt;a href=\"Stanton%20Drew%20stone%20circles\"&gt;Stanton Drew stone circles&lt;/a&gt; are said to have been formed when a wedding party continued to dance on the Lord's day. Likewise the &lt;a href=\"Wookey%20Hole%20Caves%23Witch%20of%20Wookey%20Hole\"&gt;Witch of Wookey Hole&lt;/a&gt; is said to have been turned to stone by a priest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Norton%20Fitzwarren\"&gt;Norton Fitzwarren&lt;/a&gt; Dragon is just one of many stories about dragons in Somerset. After a battle a dragon was formed from the pile of corpses and it began terrorising the area by devouring children and destroying crops. A young man took on the beast and after a long and bloody struggle, he pierced the dragons heart and cut off its head. In All Saints Church, a sixteenth-century rood screen depicts the story.\nMuseums and art galleries.\nThere are a number of museums and art galleries in the county, several of which are in Bath. These include: the &lt;a href=\"American%20Museum%20in%20Britain\"&gt;American Museum in Britain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Building%20of%20Bath%20Collection\"&gt;Building of Bath Collection&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Herschel%20Museum%20of%20Astronomy\"&gt;Herschel Museum of Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Austen%20Centre\"&gt;Jane Austen Centre&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Baths%20%28Bath%29\"&gt;Roman Baths&lt;/a&gt;.
