With CDLA, instead of the smartphone decoding the audio and outputting signal through analog 3.5mm jack, the audio piece is transferred in digital form via USB Type C to the CDLA chip typically inside the USB connector, which then produces and outputs analog signal through the normal built-in audio cable. The principle is similar to USB audio cards, which are known to produce mediocre results due to problems with shielding, as compared to professional audio equipment. There are no independent tests to prove the company claims and the whole argumentation is full of marketing with little connection to actual audio technology. It is not possible to use regular 3.5mm jack headphones with CDLA phone, it requires specialized CDLA headsets. Because of this and proprietary design, the price of CDLA unit is higher compared to 3.5mm jack headphones, while any compatibility is absent.\nSister companies.\nLeEco Global Holding.\nJia Yueting, also owned 28.83% shares of Hong Kong listed company &lt;a href=\"Coolpad%20Group\"&gt;Coolpad Group&lt;/a&gt; (as the largest shareholder and chairman of the board) via &lt;a href=\"Cayman%20Islands\"&gt;Cayman Islands&lt;/a&gt;-incorporated Lele Holding (and its subsidiary LeEco Global Holding), which had no parent-subsidiary relation with China-incorporated Leshi Holding (Beijing), the parent company of mainland China part of LeEco.\nIt was reported that LeEco Global Holding opened a call center in Russia in 2016.\nLe.com.\nLeshi Holding (Beijing) owned 0.6% shares of Shenzhen listed company &lt;a href=\"Le.com\"&gt;Le.com&lt;/a&gt;, which the largest shareholder was LeEco chairman Jia Yueting.\nLeRan Investment Management.\nNingbo &lt;a href=\"Hangzhou%20Bay%20New%20Zone\"&gt;Hangzhou Bay New District&lt;/a&gt; LeRan Investment Management, a private equity fund, was partially owned by Jia Yueting and Leshi Holding (who also owned the management company (general partner) of the fund).
