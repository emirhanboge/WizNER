    "title": "Farmers' Mutual Benefit Association",
    "text": "The Farmers' Mutual Benefit Association grew out of the agricultural unrest of the 1880s in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Farmers who felt that they were being taken advantage of by merchants and brokers formed &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt;s for buying implements and household supplies, and storing and selling crops. Many of these cooperatives in the state of &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; joined to form the Farmers' Mutual Benefit Association. The association grew to include local cooperatives in other &lt;a href=\"Midwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;Midwestern&lt;/a&gt; states. The association sent delegates to the Southern &lt;a href=\"Farmers%27%20Alliance\"&gt;Farmers' Alliance&lt;/a&gt; convention at &lt;a href=\"Ocala%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Ocala, Florida&lt;/a&gt; in December, 1890. After that, the association effectively became part of the Farmers' Alliance movement.\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"Ocala%20Demands\"&gt;Ocala Demands&lt;/a&gt;"
