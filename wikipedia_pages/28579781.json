    "text": "Rui Filipe da Cunha Faria (born 14 June 1975) is a Portuguese &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; coach, known for his work with football manager &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&lt;/a&gt; for 17 years.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nFaria was born in &lt;a href=\"Balug%C3%A3es\"&gt;Balug\u00e3es&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny parish of &lt;a href=\"Barcelos%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Barcelos&lt;/a&gt; in Portugal. Like Mourinho, he was a physical education graduate who had not played football at a high level. \nFaria's education took him to a seminar day at the &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Nou\"&gt;Camp Nou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;'s home stadium, where Mourinho was working as assistant manager to &lt;a href=\"Louis%20van%20Gaal\"&gt;Louis van Gaal&lt;/a&gt;. Mourinho saw a kindred spirit in Faria, and when he took the &lt;a href=\"U.D.%20Leiria\"&gt;Uni\u00e3o de Leiria&lt;/a&gt; job in April 2001, he hired Faria as his assistant and fitness coach.\nCoaching career.\nFaria's early time at Leiria, emblematic of Mourinho's new fitness regime, led to a stand-off with the club's directors. Since then, the two have been inseparable, with Faria joining &lt;a href=\"FC%20Porto\"&gt;Porto&lt;/a&gt; in January 2002, Mourinho's first month in charge of his new club. He was part of the club's staff for their 2003 &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Primeira%20Liga\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"treble%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;treble&lt;/a&gt; and won the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; with the club. Faria then followed Mourinho to &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; that summer along with assistant manager &lt;a href=\"Baltemar%20Brito\"&gt;Baltemar Brito&lt;/a&gt;, chief scout &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Villas-Boas\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas&lt;/a&gt; and goalkeeping coach &lt;a href=\"Silvino%20Louro\"&gt;Silvino Louro&lt;/a&gt;. He became ubiquitous in his Chelsea tracksuit on the &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; side's bench.\nFaria left Chelsea in late 2007, following Mourinho out of the club, and joined him at &lt;a href=\"Inter%20Milan\"&gt;Internazionale&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 2008. In June 2009, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas left to manage &lt;a href=\"Associa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Acad%C3%A9mica%20de%20Coimbra%20%E2%80%93%20O.A.F.\"&gt;Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra&lt;/a&gt; (later following in Mourinho's footsteps by taking over Porto, then Chelsea) and was replaced at Inter by &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Morais\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Morais&lt;/a&gt;. After winning the &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; in their first season, the side completed a high-profile treble of &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coppa%20Italia\"&gt;cup&lt;/a&gt; and Champions League in 2010. Since the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20Real%20Madrid%20C.F.%20season\"&gt;2010\u201311 season&lt;/a&gt;, Faria was the assistant coach of &lt;a href=\"Real%20Madrid%20C.F.\"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, moving to the club along with Mourinho, Morais and Louro. Faria followed Mourinho back to Chelsea, when he was confirmed as the manager in June 2013.\nHe has worked alongside Mourinho since 2002, a period that had seen the manager and his staff fail to lose a league game at home in eight years, the run ending with a 0\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n\"&gt;Sporting de Gij\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; whilst with Real Madrid. Mourinho described Faria as his \"methodology right arm, the guy that understands best my information and the way I work\".\nIn April 2014, Faria was sent from the dugout by referee &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Dean%20%28referee%29\"&gt;Mike Dean&lt;/a&gt; following the coach's aggressive behaviour to the official during Chelsea's home defeat to &lt;a href=\"Sunderland%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;. He was charged with using abusive and insulting words. He received a four-match stadium ban after appealing against a six-match ban.\nFaria once again was appointed as Mourinho's assistant upon his appointment at &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. In May 2018, Faria resigned as assistant manager of Manchester United to spend more time with his family, ending his 17 year partnership with Mourinho.\nOn 18 January 2019, Faria was appointed manager of &lt;a href=\"Qatar%20Stars%20League\"&gt;Qatar Stars League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Al-Duhail%20SC\"&gt;Al-Duhail&lt;/a&gt;, his first full management position. He resigned from his role one year later.\nControversy.\nAs with his long-time manager, colleague and friend Mourinho, Faria has been the subject of controversy in the media. In a match against &lt;a href=\"Reading%20F.C.\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, where Chelsea goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Petr%20%C4%8Cech\"&gt;Petr \u010cech&lt;/a&gt; received a severe blow to the head, Faria was sent off alongside Chelsea midfielder &lt;a href=\"Mikel%20John%20Obi\"&gt;Mikel John Obi&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn a &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2005 Champions League quarter-final&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Bayern%20Munich\"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt;, where Mourinho was suspended for Chelsea, Faria was seen wearing a woolly hat and scratching his ear enough to elicit suspicions that Mourinho was covertly communicating with his fitness coach. \nAt Real Madrid, Faria was said to have been party to an altercation with Sporting de Gij\u00f3n manager &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Preciado\"&gt;Manuel Preciado&lt;/a&gt; after a match between the two clubs in November 2010. \nIn April 2014, Faria was dismissed from the Chelsea bench during the home defeat against Sunderland when he made comments to the fourth official complaining about a penalty that had been awarded to Sunderland. It was alleged he had used \"abusive and/or insulting words\". The match resulted in Chelsea's first-ever &lt;a href=\"Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; loss at &lt;a href=\"Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;Stamford Bridge&lt;/a&gt; under Mourinho.\nPersonal life.\nFaria is married and is a father to three children.\nHonours.\nAs assistant coach.\nAs an assistant coach, including a sabbatical in 2007\u201308, Faria's club sides have won their domestic league eight times, the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; once and the Champions League twice. Between 2002 and 2012, Mourinho and Faria did not go a full season or a calendar year without winning at least one trophy.\nPorto\nChelsea\nInternazionale\nReal Madrid\nChelsea\nManchester United\nThe Treble\nAs head coach.\nAl-Duhail"
