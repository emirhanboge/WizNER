The population was 238 as of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe community was founded at a &lt;a href=\"salt%20lick\"&gt;salt lick&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Trace%20%28road%29\"&gt;Buffalo Trace&lt;/a&gt; stretching from the &lt;a href=\"Licking%20River%20%28Kentucky%29\"&gt;Licking River&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Drennon%20Springs\"&gt;Drennon Springs&lt;/a&gt;.
