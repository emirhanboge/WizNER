    "text": "Route 450 (also known as &lt;a href=\"James%20Cook\"&gt;Captain Cook&lt;/a&gt;'s Trail) is a highway in the &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/a&gt;. The highway starts at an interchange at &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador%20Route%201\"&gt;Route 1&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Trans-Canada%20Highway\"&gt;Trans-Canada Highway&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Corner%20Brook\"&gt;Corner Brook&lt;/a&gt;. When approaching O'Connell Drive, motorists can turn left to continue their journey along the route. The route terminates at a &lt;a href=\"cul-de-sac\"&gt;cul-de-sac&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lark%20Harbour\"&gt;Lark Harbour&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoute 450 made headlines in Newfoundland in January 2018 when massive rainfall caused flooding on January 13 and created a huge crater causing a large portion in the highway to collapse, thus separating residents in Lark Harbour and &lt;a href=\"York%20Harbour\"&gt;York Harbour&lt;/a&gt; from the remainder of the island. The impacted portion of the road was reopened to traffic on January 17, 2018.\nRoute description.\nRoute 450 begins in &lt;a href=\"Corner%20Brook%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Corner Brook&lt;/a&gt; at an interchange with &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador%20Route%201\"&gt;Route 1&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Trans-Canada%20Highway\"&gt;Trans-Canada Highway&lt;/a&gt;, Exit 4), with the road continuing northeast as Massey Drive to the town of the same &lt;a href=\"Massey%20Drive%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;name&lt;/a&gt;. It heads west along the southern edge of the city to have an intersection with Wheelers Road, which provides access to the &lt;a href=\"Grenfell%20Campus\"&gt;Grenfell Campus&lt;/a&gt;. The highway now heads northwest through neighbourhood/industrial area to have intersections with Mac Donald Brown Drive, Lundrigan Drive, Sunnyslope Drive, O'Connell Drive, before making a sharp left turn at an intersection with &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador%20Route%20450A\"&gt;Route 450A&lt;/a&gt; (Lewin Parkway). Route 450 now passes through the &lt;a href=\"Curling%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Curling&lt;/a&gt; section of town before leaving Corner Brook before winding its along the southern shore of &lt;a href=\"Humber%20Arm\"&gt;Humber Arm&lt;/a&gt; to pass through &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Moriah%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Mount Moriah&lt;/a&gt; (where it crosses &lt;a href=\"Cooks%20Brook%20%28Newfoundland%29\"&gt;Cooks Brook&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Humber%20Arm%20South%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Humber Arm South&lt;/a&gt; (where a couple of turns are needed to stay on the highway, one to the right, and the other to the left), and &lt;a href=\"York%20Harbour%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;York Harbour&lt;/a&gt;, all within the rugged terrain of the &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20Hills\"&gt;Lewis Hills&lt;/a&gt; portion of the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Range%20Mountains\"&gt;Long Range Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The highway now enters &lt;a href=\"Lark%20Harbour%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Lark Harbour&lt;/a&gt; and passes by &lt;a href=\"Blow%20Me%20Down%20Provincial%20Park\"&gt;Blow Me Down Provincial Park&lt;/a&gt; before passing through town, where it has an intersection with a local road leading to &lt;a href=\"Bottle%20Cove%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Bottle Cove&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Little%20Port%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;Little Port&lt;/a&gt;, before the pavement (and Route 450) comes to an end at the eastern edge of town."
