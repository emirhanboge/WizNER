    "text": "Woo Sang-ho (&lt;a href=\"Korean%20language\"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt;: \uc6b0\uc0c1\ud638, born 12 December 1962) is a South Korean activist and politician who served as the parliamentary leader of the &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 to 2017. He has been the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Member of the National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Seodaemun%20District\"&gt;Seodaemun&lt;/a&gt; 1st constituency from 2004 to 2008, and since 2012. Ideologically, he is described as a &lt;a href=\"centrism\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt;.\nWoo was born in &lt;a href=\"Cheorwon%20County\"&gt;Cheorwon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gangwon%20Province%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Gangwon&lt;/a&gt;, and raised in &lt;a href=\"Seoul\"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;, where he attended &lt;a href=\"Yongmoon%20High%20School\"&gt;Yongmoon High School&lt;/a&gt;. He joined student movements and took a crucial role during the &lt;a href=\"June%20Struggle\"&gt;June Struggle&lt;/a&gt;, while studying &lt;a href=\"Korean%20language\"&gt;Korean language&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Yonsei%20University\"&gt;Yonsei University&lt;/a&gt;. Following his graduation in 1989, he joined politics during &lt;a href=\"1995%20South%20Korean%20local%20elections\"&gt;1995 local elections&lt;/a&gt;. He firstly contested in &lt;a href=\"2000%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2000 election&lt;/a&gt; for Seodaemun 1st constituency but lost to &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Seong-heon\"&gt;Lee Seong-heon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was firstly elected in &lt;a href=\"2004%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, but lost again in &lt;a href=\"2008%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;. After coming back to the National Assembly in &lt;a href=\"2012%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, he became the parliamentary leader of the Democratic Party in 2016. He took a crucial role during the &lt;a href=\"2016%20South%20Korean%20political%20scandal\"&gt;2016 political scandal&lt;/a&gt; that triggered the &lt;a href=\"Impeachment%20of%20Park%20Geun-hye\"&gt;impeachment&lt;/a&gt; of the then &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20South%20Korea\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Park%20Geun-hye\"&gt;Park Geun-hye&lt;/a&gt;. He worked close to the Democratic presidential candidate &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Jae-in\"&gt;Moon Jae-in&lt;/a&gt; who was elected in &lt;a href=\"2017%20South%20Korean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2018%20South%20Korean%20local%20elections\"&gt;2018 local elections&lt;/a&gt;, Woo was one of the favourable candidate for the &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Seoul\"&gt;Seoul mayorship&lt;/a&gt;. He contested Democratic &lt;a href=\"preselection\"&gt;preselection&lt;/a&gt; but lost to the then Mayor &lt;a href=\"Park%20Won-soon\"&gt;Park Won-soon&lt;/a&gt;. Following the death of Park in 2020, he ran again Democratic preselection for the same position for the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Seoul%20mayoral%20election\"&gt;2021 election&lt;/a&gt; but lost to &lt;a href=\"Park%20Young-sun\"&gt;Park Young-sun&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and education.\nWoo Sang-ho was born on 12 December 1962 in &lt;a href=\"Cheorwon%20County\"&gt;Cheorwon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gangwon%20Province%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Gangwon&lt;/a&gt;. He is the youngest of the three sons and a daughter of Park Byung-hui (died in 2013), a health centre worker. His father was born in 1916, as the eldest son of a landowner in Cheorwon, and studied at &lt;a href=\"Chuncheon%20High%20School\"&gt;Chuncheon High School&lt;/a&gt;. He also studied physical education at &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Imperial%20University\"&gt;Tokyo Imperial University&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Tokyo\"&gt;University of Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, following the &lt;a href=\"surrender%20of%20Japan\"&gt;surrender of Japan&lt;/a&gt; in 1945, his land was deprived by the &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20Party%20of%20North%20Korea\"&gt;Workers' Party of North Korea&lt;/a&gt; as Cheorwan was above of the &lt;a href=\"38th%20parallel%20north\"&gt;38th parallel north&lt;/a&gt; and therefore was under the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Civil%20Administration\"&gt;rule of Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. He moved to &lt;a href=\"Busan\"&gt;Busan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;, but following the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Armistice%20Agreement\"&gt;Armistice Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, he married Park Byung-hui in &lt;a href=\"Seoul\"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt; and returned to Cheorwon. As Cheorwon was recovered by &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, parts of his land was recovered, but he sold all of them and built a school. A house was his sole property when his youngest son was born. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republican%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Democratic Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Woo was a &lt;a href=\"primary%20school\"&gt;primary school&lt;/a&gt; Form 6 student, the family moved to Seoul, where his father rented a one-room with a shared tap and a toilet. He later described during these time as \"too poor\" and also revealed that he never had his own room until his marriage. At his &lt;a href=\"secondary%20school\"&gt;secondary school&lt;/a&gt;, he was &lt;a href=\"school%20corporal%20punishment\"&gt;caned&lt;/a&gt; by his class teacher as he was unable to pay the school fees. All of his elder siblings had given up continuing their tertiary educations due to the unaffordable fees, despite of high results. On the other hand, his mother was seriously willing to send him to a university and sought a help from relatives.\nWoo graduated from &lt;a href=\"Yongmoon%20High%20School\"&gt;Yongmoon High School&lt;/a&gt; in 1981. He then attended &lt;a href=\"Yonsei%20University\"&gt;Yonsei University&lt;/a&gt;, where he studied &lt;a href=\"Korean%20language\"&gt;Korean language&lt;/a&gt;. During the Year 1 and 2, his aim was becoming a poet or Korean teacher. He was a member of Yonsei Literary Society, a club within his university. In May 1986, he received the Yun Tong-Ju Poetry Prize.\nIn 1984, his second elder brother was involved in a &lt;a href=\"traffic%20collision\"&gt;traffic collision&lt;/a&gt; and became a disabled. He then committed &lt;a href=\"suicide\"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly career and political activities.\nInitially, Woo's interest towards politics had begun in 1979, when the then &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20South%20Korea\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Park%20Chung-hee\"&gt;Park Chung-hee&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20of%20Park%20Chung-hee\"&gt;assassinated&lt;/a&gt;. During the early 1980s, he had connections with several student activities studying at the same university, he kept his distance with them on purpose.\nHe had begun his activist career while serving the &lt;a href=\"conscription%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;national service&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, when South Korea held the &lt;a href=\"1985%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;general election on 12 February&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the election, the newly formed opposition &lt;a href=\"New%20Korea%20and%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;New Korea and Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (NKDP) was gradually gaining popularity among people. About a week before the election, his &lt;a href=\"Company%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; commander threatened soldiers including him not to vote the NKDP, but he proceeded to cast his vote to the NKDP and was scolded by his company commander. Other than this incident, his colleague, &lt;a href=\"Park%20Rae-goon\"&gt;Park Rae-goon&lt;/a&gt; (later the President of Human Rights Foundation Saram), visited his military camp and urged him to be an activist.\nAfter being discharged from the national service in 1985, Woo subsequently joined a seminar team consists of the class of '84, following the suggestion of &lt;a href=\"Oh%20Yeon-ho\"&gt;Oh Yeon-ho&lt;/a&gt;. Although Woo was the class of '81, he used an alias \"Kang-ta, the class of '84, studying Korean language\" to not fear his juniors. He did not inform his activism to his mother at first, but later revealed her.\nIn 1987, Woo was elected the President of the Student Council of Yonsei University. He also served as the 1st Deputy President of the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20National%20University%20Student%20Representatives\"&gt;Association of National University Student Representatives&lt;/a&gt; under its President &lt;a href=\"Lee%20In-young\"&gt;Lee In-young&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 13 April 1987, the then President &lt;a href=\"Chun%20Doo-hwan\"&gt;Chun Doo-hwan&lt;/a&gt; announced that the &lt;a href=\"1987%20South%20Korean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;upcoming presidential election&lt;/a&gt; would be an &lt;a href=\"indirect%20election\"&gt;indirect election&lt;/a&gt; as usual under the incumbent &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20South%20Korea\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement, which was strongly objected by oppositions and activities, provoked the &lt;a href=\"June%20Struggle\"&gt;June Struggle&lt;/a&gt;. Woo organised mass protests against the government's decision on 10 June, the same day with the party election of the then ruling &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Justice%20Party\"&gt;Democratic Justice Party&lt;/a&gt; (DJP), where &lt;a href=\"Roh%20Tae-woo\"&gt;Roh Tae-woo&lt;/a&gt; was elected its presidential candidate. A day before, they held a practical protest at Yonsei University, but one of the member &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Han-yeol\"&gt;Lee Han-yeol&lt;/a&gt;, who was also a junior to Woo, collapsed to the ground after a tear gas fired by the suppression forces hit his head. He was immediately brought to a hospital but died on 5 July after being in coma for about a month. Woo organised Lee's funeral and kept his portrait along with &lt;a href=\"Woo%20Hyun\"&gt;Woo Hyun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ahn%20Nae-sang\"&gt;Ahn Nae-sang&lt;/a&gt;; both are now actors.\nThe mass demonstrations against military dictatorship led the DJP President and presidential candidate Roh Tae-woo to announce the &lt;a href=\"29%20June%20Declaration\"&gt;29 June Declaration&lt;/a&gt; to fulfill the transition to democracy. However, policemen who caused the death of Lee Han-yeol were not arrested, and Woo Sang-ho were heading to &lt;a href=\"Seoul%20District%20Public%20Prosecutors%27%20Office\"&gt;Seoul District Public Prosecutors' Office&lt;/a&gt; to complain about the issue. He and Woo Hyun were subsequently arrested by police at Daehan Gate of &lt;a href=\"Deoksugung\"&gt;Deoksugung&lt;/a&gt; and were tortured at &lt;a href=\"Seoul%20Namdaemun%20Police%20Station\"&gt;Seoul Namdaemun Police Station&lt;/a&gt;. The torture was stopped after the detective in charge had recognised that Woo was the President of the Student Council of Yonsei University. Instead, Woo was jailed under the contempt of the country following an interview with Nicholas Christopher from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" where he compared the South Korean government to &lt;a href=\"Nazi\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, he was imprisoned at &lt;a href=\"Seodaemun%20Prison\"&gt;Seoul Detention Centre&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Seodaemun Prison) in November 1987, but was relocated to newly built &lt;a href=\"Seoul%20Detention%20Centre\"&gt;Seoul Detention Centre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uiwang\"&gt;Uiwang&lt;/a&gt; as the old dentention centre in Seoul was closed.\nFollowing his release in 1988, Woo was one of the founding member of Gyeryong Alpine Club, along with the first leadership board of the ANUSR. He also served as a member of the Steering Committee of the Patriotic Youth Association in 1989 and the Deputy Spokesperson of the National Union for Democracy and Ethnic Reunification in 1992. He was also a Planning Committee member of \"&lt;a href=\"Monthly%20Mal\"&gt;Monthly Mal&lt;/a&gt;\". Other than political activities, he also established Youth Information and Culture Centre in 1994, and served as the Managing Director of Video Graphics in 1997.\nPolitical career.\nEarly political career (1988-2004).\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"1988%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;1988 election&lt;/a&gt;, Woo was invited by &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Dae-jung\"&gt;Kim Dae-jung&lt;/a&gt; and met him in &lt;a href=\"Donggyo-dong\"&gt;Donggyo-dong&lt;/a&gt;. Kim, who was the then Chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Peace Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (PDP), was bringing notable pro-opposition activists into the party. If Woo was brought into the PDP and was elected to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Member of the National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, he could be the youngest MP in South Korea (he was just 25 years old during that time). However, he rejected the invitation as he thought that opposition parties should be responsible for the Roh Tae-woo and his DJP's victory in the &lt;a href=\"1987%20South%20Korean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;1987 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; due to the vote split.\nHis political activities were begun in the &lt;a href=\"1995%20South%20Korean%20local%20elections\"&gt;1995 local elections&lt;/a&gt;. Although he did not contest, he gave a support to a &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Seoul\"&gt;Seoul mayoral&lt;/a&gt; candidate. The next year, he was brought into the &lt;a href=\"National%20Congress%20for%20New%20Politics\"&gt;National Congress for New Politics&lt;/a&gt; (NCNP), the then main opposition party formed by Kim Dae-jung.\nWoo firstly contested in the &lt;a href=\"2000%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2000 election&lt;/a&gt; for Seodaemun 1st constituency. A year before, the then incumbent MP &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Sang-hyun%20%28politician%2C%20born%201935%29\"&gt;Kim Sang-hyun&lt;/a&gt; was seeking re-election, but also showed his intention that the upcoming new party (later named as the &lt;a href=\"Millennium%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Millennium Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;; MDP) should hold a &lt;a href=\"preselection\"&gt;preselection&lt;/a&gt; for the constituency. On the other hand, as Woo was likely to be the candidate for the constituency, Kim condemned the party and showed an opinion polling that indicated Kim was more capable than Woo. Despite Kim's criticism, Woo officially won MDP preselection on 17 February. Kim did not accept the result and subsequently withdrew from the MDP. He later joined the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20National%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Democratic National Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the MDP candidate, Woo contested against the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20National%20Party\"&gt;GNP&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Seong-heon\"&gt;Lee Seong-heon&lt;/a&gt;, his senior whom he met at Yonsei University. Woo gained popularity under the slogan \"Young politics, clean politics\" but lost to Kim on 13 April with a small margin (Lee: 47.01%, Woo: 45.16%). Following the election lost, he briefly worked as a visiting researcher at &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20State%20University\"&gt;Colorado State University&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in 2001.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"2002%20South%20Korean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2002 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, Woo invited &lt;a href=\"Roh%20Moo-hyun\"&gt;Roh Moo-hyun&lt;/a&gt;, who was considering to run for the upcoming presidential election, to Seodaemun 1st constituency, where Woo was the party's Division Head after he lost. He endorsed Roh, whom he was inspired from. At that time, Roh was far behind of &lt;a href=\"Lee%20In-je\"&gt;Lee In-je&lt;/a&gt;, who was the most favourable candidate of the MDP. During the presidential primary, Woo went to Gangwon and urged its party members to vote Roh, but could only gained supports from 14 people. Nevertheless, on 24 March, Roh barely defeated Lee in Gangwon with a margin of 7 votes (Roh: 630, Lee: 623). Roh then was officially elected the MDP presidential candidate, however, he was challenged within the party following the party's huge defeat in &lt;a href=\"2002%20South%20Korean%20local%20elections\"&gt;2002 local elections&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Chung%20Mong-joon\"&gt;Chung Mong-joon&lt;/a&gt;. Several party members including &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Min-seok%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Kim Min-seok&lt;/a&gt; (former Seoul mayoral candidate lost to &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Myung-bak\"&gt;Lee Myung-bak&lt;/a&gt;) against Roh quit the party and formed the &lt;a href=\"Council%20for%20a%20Unity%20Candidate\"&gt;Council for a Unity Candidate&lt;/a&gt; (CUC) that endorsed Chung. Several MPs accused CUC and established the National Participation Movement Headquarter, where Woo was its Deputy Head, to support Roh. However, Chung had withdrawn and agreed to back Roh. On 19 December, Roh defeated the GNP candidate &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Hoi-chang\"&gt;Lee Hoi-chang&lt;/a&gt; and was elected the 16th President of South Korea.\nThe MDP was, however, under crisis after Roh took an oath as the President of the Republic. MPs from both the MDP and the GNP who sought political reforms subsequently left the party. Roh himself also quit the MDP on 29 September 2003. In October, Woo was also one of the MPs withdrawn from the MDP. They established a new party named &lt;a href=\"Uri%20Party\"&gt;Uri Party&lt;/a&gt;, but Roh did not join until 2004.\nFirst term as the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Member of the National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; (2004-2008).\nThe &lt;a href=\"2004%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2004 election&lt;/a&gt; was held amid the impeachment of Roh Moo-hyun that provoked public angers. The \"de facto\" ruling Uri Party was expected to win majority. In the election, Woo contested again for Seodaemun 1st constituency against the then incumbent MP and the GNP candidate Lee Seong-heon. Woo was leading in various polls and on 15 April, he successfully defeated Lee.\nDuring the first year, the abolishment of the controversial &lt;a href=\"National%20Security%20Act%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;National Security Act&lt;/a&gt; had been an crucial issue in politics. Many Uri MPs supported the abolishment, while Woo was one of them. During an interview with &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Solidarity%20for%20Participatory%20Democracy\"&gt;People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy&lt;/a&gt;, he said that he would persuade another MPs to get endorsements. Nevertheless, not all Uri MPs were advocating the abolishment, and the main opposition GNP strongly objected the bid. The Uri Party finally decided to support the abolishment, but was never happened amid the internal conflicts and strong oppositions from the GNP. The party leadership was immediately faced harsh criticisms and was collapsed on 3 January 2005.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"2006%20South%20Korean%20local%20elections\"&gt;2006 local elections&lt;/a&gt;, Woo was appointed the new Spokesperson of the Uri Party under the new Chairman &lt;a href=\"Chung%20Dong-young\"&gt;Chung Dong-young&lt;/a&gt;. After the party had chosen the former &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Justice%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Justice Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kang%20Kum-sil\"&gt;Kang Kum-sil&lt;/a&gt; as its Seoul mayoral candidate, Woo subsequently joined her campaign. However, the election was ended up as a crushing defeat of the Uri Party, where the party only secured the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20North%20Jeolla%20Province\"&gt;North Jeolla governorship&lt;/a&gt;. Kang, who was leading the early polls, lost to the GNP candidate &lt;a href=\"Oh%20Se-hoon\"&gt;Oh Se-hoon&lt;/a&gt; with a wide margin.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2008%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2008 election&lt;/a&gt;, Woo faced the 3rd match against Lee Seong-heon. He promised to make Seodaemun as the \"district of prestigious education\", as well as opposing Yeonhui-dong Chinatown masterplan proposed by the Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon. He, however, came far behind to Lee amid high popularity of the new government of &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Myung-bak\"&gt;Lee Myung-bak&lt;/a&gt;. On 9 April, he received 28,142 votes (43.50%) and lost to Lee.\nExtra-parliamentary career and return (2008-2012).\nOn 14 August 2009, after about a year he lost, Woo was appointed the new Spokesperson of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%2C%202008%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; following the resignation of &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Yoo-jung%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Kim Yoo-jung&lt;/a&gt;. His return was somehow regarded as the return of the &lt;a href=\"386%20Generation\"&gt;386 Generation&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2012%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2012 election&lt;/a&gt;, Woo sought his return as an MP for Seodaemun 1st constituency. He faced the 4th challenge against Lee Seong-heon, who was contesting under the &lt;a href=\"Saenuri%20Party\"&gt;Saenuri&lt;/a&gt; banner at that time. Though many opinion polls showed that both candidate were neck and neck or Woo came behind to Lee, Woo was leading in the exit polls (Woo: 56.3%, Lee: 43.7%). In the end, he received 40,481 votes and defeated Lee, making a comeback to the National Assembly after 4 years.\nParliamentary leader of the Democratic Party (2016-2017).\nElection.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2016%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2016 election&lt;/a&gt;, the main 2 opposition parties \u2014 the Democratic Party, and the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%2C%202016%29\"&gt;People's Party&lt;/a&gt;, won majority amid &lt;a href=\"upset%20victory\"&gt;upset victory&lt;/a&gt;. Woo again defeated Lee Seong-heon in 5th match since 2000. On 29 April 2016, shortly after his re-election as an MP, Woo officially launched his bid for the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; parliamentary leadership. In the declaration, he mentioned that the election result (where the ruling Saenuri Party lost majority) was the people's mandate and urged the oppositions to unite against the ruling party. He criticised that the Democratic Party was ignoring people's livelihoods due to the internal conflict, and promised that he would forward 3 main agenda: to reduce the burden of people's living, lower communication expense, and cut the private education cost. He also added that he would create new \"stars\" among one- or two-term MPs. He indicated that if he is elected, he would support first-term MPs to lead the parliamentary reforms. He urged all of the party MPs to unite, emphasising that he would brook faction politics within the National Assembly.\nOn 4 May, Woo Sang-ho received 36 votes and therefore came behind of &lt;a href=\"Woo%20Won-shik\"&gt;Woo Won-shik&lt;/a&gt; who obtained 40 votes. Since no candidates received majority, the second round was held in the afternoon. In the second round, Woo Sang-ho gained 63 votes and successfully defeated Woo Won-shik (56 votes), who was backed by the National Alliance for Democracy and Peace and pro-&lt;a href=\"Sohn%20Hak-kyu\"&gt;Sohn Hak-kyu&lt;/a&gt; factions. Several sources analysed that Woo Sang-ho was widely supported by both pro-Roh Moo-hyun and pro-&lt;a href=\"Moon%20Jae-in\"&gt;Moon Jae-in&lt;/a&gt; factions.\nCommittee negotiations.\nThe presidency of each parliamentary committee had become crucial as the Democratic Party won the most seats (123/300) but just one more than the Saenuri Party (122/300) in the April general election. Nevertheless, since non-&lt;a href=\"conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; oppositions held majority seats, the Democratic Party had gained chances to take the &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20of%20the%20National%20Assembly%20of%20South%20Korea\"&gt;speakership&lt;/a&gt;, as well as most of the committee presidencies.\nThe negotiation on 8 June was done between &lt;a href=\"Chung%20Jin-suk%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Chung Jin-suk&lt;/a&gt; (Saenuri), Woo Sang-ho (Democratic) and &lt;a href=\"Park%20Jie-won\"&gt;Park Jie-won&lt;/a&gt; (People's), and the result was successful; eight each from the Saenuri and the Democratic, and two from the People's Party. Therefore, Saenuri Party lost 2 committees (the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee and the Special Committee on Budget and Accounts) to the Democratic Party. The Legislation and Judiciary Committee, which was often regarded as the \"de facto\" \"Senate\", was taken by the Democratic Party during the last session (2012-2016), but was handed over to the Saenuri Party in this time. Nevertheless, the Democratic Party successfully elected the new Speaker, &lt;a href=\"Chung%20Sye-kyun\"&gt;Chung Sye-kyun&lt;/a&gt;, from its party.\nParliamentary leadership.\nOn 8 May, Woo appointed 11 deputy parliamentary leaders, they are: &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Hoon%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Lee Hoon&lt;/a&gt; (Planning Cluster), &lt;a href=\"Back%20Hye-ryun\"&gt;Back Hye-ryun&lt;/a&gt; (Law Cluster), &lt;a href=\"Song%20Ki-hun\"&gt;Song Ki-hun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kang%20Byung-won\"&gt;Kang Byung-won&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Park%20Jeung\"&gt;Park Jeung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yoo%20Dong-soo\"&gt;Yoo Dong-soo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mun%20Mi-ock\"&gt;Mun Mi-ock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"An%20Ho-young\"&gt;An Ho-young&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oh%20Young-hun\"&gt;Oh Young-hun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Choi%20In-ho%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Choi In-ho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Byung-wook%20%28politician%2C%20born%201965%29\"&gt;Kim Byung-wook&lt;/a&gt;. All of them were the first-term MPs, as well as from both pro-Roh Moo-hyun and pro-Sohn Hak-kyu factions. \"Straight News\" analysed Woo's decision as the purpose of internal unity.\nUnder his parliamentary leadership, Woo adopted so-called \"member responsibility system\", which officially enacts suggestions and alternatives brought during interpellations. The main reason of its adoption was \"to suggest alternatives for the 9-year conservative governments' economic failures\". According to the system, both the parliamentary leader and its first deputy oversee interpellations and parliamentary inspections, and the representative MPs are selected for each issue.\nHearing session of &lt;a href=\"Baek%20Nam-gi\"&gt;Baek Nam-gi&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 14 November 2015, a farmer named &lt;a href=\"Baek%20Nam-gi\"&gt;Baek Nam-gi&lt;/a&gt; was brought to a hospital after he was hit by a water cannon from the police. The incident provoked controversies in South Korean society, and on 26 May 2016, the Democratic Party promised to hold a hearing session to find the truth of the case.\nHowever, as there were no progresses, Woo criticised the Park Geun-hye administration for being \"not cooperative\" on 22 July. He also emphasised that a special hearing session must be held, and the people in charge should be responsible. On 3 August, 11 MPs from the Democratic Party including Woo visited Baek, who was in a critical situation, at &lt;a href=\"Seoul%20National%20University%20Hospital\"&gt;Seoul National University Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. He told them that in case the Saenuri Party kept rejecting a hearing session, 3 opposition parties \u2014 Democratic, People's, and Justice, would proceed to reveal the truth.\nIn August, the so-called \"West Hall Hearing\" had been an issue that targeted &lt;a href=\"Choi%20Kyoung-hwan\"&gt;Choi Kyoung-hwan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ahn%20Jong-beom\"&gt;Ahn Jong-beom&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, Woo urged the government to hold a hearing that includes both, but later they were both excluded following a negotiation. Instead, both the Saenuri Party and the oppositions agreed to hold a hearing session of Baek Nam-gi.\nThe hearing session was held at the National Assembly Proceeding Hall on 12 September. &lt;a href=\"Kang%20Shin-myung\"&gt;Kang Shin-myung&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href=\"National%20Police%20Agency%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;National Police Agency&lt;/a&gt; Commissioner General during the incident, refused to apologise as \"the incident occurred amid violent demonstration\". Opposition MPs i.e. &lt;a href=\"Pyo%20Chang-won\"&gt;Pyo Chang-won&lt;/a&gt; condemned his remarks.\nBaek died on 25 September, after being in a coma for almost a year. The government's suggestion of a postmortem was harshly criticised by the bereaved family members and opposition politicians. Woo showed his objection towards the postmortem, indicating that \"There's already a video recording his collapse, as well as medical opinions.\" He also accused the government for \"using the incident to divide the nation\". On 26 October, he also condemned the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Prosecutors%27%20Office%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Korea\"&gt;prosecution&lt;/a&gt; for not allowing the late's funeral.\n&lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Investigation%20Office%20for%20High-ranking%20Officials\"&gt;Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 19 July, Woo agreed with Park Jie-won, the then parliamentary leader of the People's Party, regarding an issue related to the proposed &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20Investigation%20Office%20for%20High-ranking%20Officials\"&gt;Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials&lt;/a&gt; (CIO). 2 days later, Woo indicated that \"various prosecution reforms were discussed but were never happened due to the strong objection from the Saenuri Party\". He added that the establishment of the CIO is to enhance the South Korean democracy, as well as to get rid of &lt;a href=\"corruption\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;s from high-ranking officials. According to the suggestion, the CIO will investigate crimes related to one's duty, embezzlement and breach of trust, breach of the Political Fund Law, and so on.\nThe CIO was finally established on 21 January 2021, after the Democratic Party's overwhelming victory in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2020 election&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"2016%20South%20Korean%20political%20scandal\"&gt;2016 political scandal&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 25 October 2017, Woo revealed to \"&lt;a href=\"SisaIN\"&gt;SisaIN&lt;/a&gt;\" about what he had done during the political scandal in 2016. According to the interview, after he received reports related to &lt;a href=\"Choi%20Soon-sil\"&gt;Choi Soon-sil&lt;/a&gt; in July 2016, he formed a private task force with &lt;a href=\"Cho%20Eung-cheon\"&gt;Cho Eung-cheon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sohn%20Hye-won\"&gt;Sohn Hye-won&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Do%20Jong-hwan\"&gt;Do Jong-hwan&lt;/a&gt;. As the issue gradually gained public attentions, the Democratic Party suggested the removal of the then &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Agriculture%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Jae-soo\"&gt;Kim Jae-soo&lt;/a&gt; in order to bring the issues to a proposed parliamentary inspection. The inspection was, however, crippled as the Saenuri Party boycotted it and the party President &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Jung-hyun%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Lee Jung-hyun&lt;/a&gt; had launched a hunger strike \"till the resignation of the Speaker Chung Sye-kyun\". Lee stopped his protest after a week, and the Saenuri Party returned to the inspection.\nThe approval ratings of the then President &lt;a href=\"Park%20Geun-hye\"&gt;Park Geun-hye&lt;/a&gt; plummeted following a report of &lt;a href=\"JTBC\"&gt;JTBC&lt;/a&gt; about Choi Soon-sil on 24 October. Various netizens, students, celebrities and politicians urged Park to step down. &lt;a href=\"2016%E2%80%932017%20South%20Korean%20protests\"&gt;Thousands and millions of people demonstrated against the government&lt;/a&gt;.\nRather than impeach her from the beginning, Woo set 3-level strategies: go away-resign-impeach. Initially, he called Park to confess and go away from politics. He later told \"SisaIN\" that Park visited the National Assembly Proceeding Hall on 8 November and said, \"the new Prime Minister will be elected by the National Assembly, and will oversee the Cabinet\". However, according to his possible outcome, \"go away\" would only form a &lt;a href=\"national%20unity%20government\"&gt;national unity government&lt;/a&gt; that could split between the oppositions and the protesters, and Woo, who has suggested the moderate approaches, would fall into a crisis. The Democratic Party then urged Park to resign on 15 November. On 21 November, both the Democratic Party and the People's Party agreed to impeach Park. On the other hand, a confrontation happened between two parties, as the Democratic Party supported the impeachment vote on 2 December, while the People's Party wanted it on 9 December. The latter was confirmed following a negotiation with the 2 parties and the &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Justice Party&lt;/a&gt;. Woo later revealed to \"SisaIN\" that if the former was adopted, the oppositions might not get enough votes from the Saenuri MPs.\nOn 9 December, 234 out of 300 MPs (1 did not attend) voted in favour of the impeachment of Park. The same day, a photo was taken, where Woo raised his right hand in greeting to someone. The photo has later become a viral on the Internet as the \"someone\" was a bereaved family member to a victim of the &lt;a href=\"Sinking%20of%20MV%20Sewol\"&gt;MV Sewol tragedy&lt;/a&gt;. On 10 March 2017, the &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Constitutional Court&lt;/a&gt; upheld the impeachment in a unanimous 8\u20130 decision.\nThe impeachment of the first female president of the country provoked the &lt;a href=\"2017%20South%20Korean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;snap presidential election on 9 May&lt;/a&gt;. In the election, Moon Jae-in, the most favourable candidate, was elected the new President of the Republic.\nDemocratic in government (2017-present).\nFollowing the inauguration of the new President Moon Jae-in, Woo was rumoured that he would be appointed the new &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Unification\"&gt;Minister of Unification&lt;/a&gt;. He denied the claim, saying that \"those fresh and capable talents should be the ministers.\" He also added that he would keep contributing for the success of the new government from the National Assembly.\nIn early 2019, Woo was considered the most likely person to be the new &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Culture%2C%20Sports%20and%20Tourism\"&gt;Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, when a cabinet reshuffle was announced on 8 March, his name was excluded. Initially, the Democratic Party spokesperson &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Hae-sik\"&gt;Lee Hae-sik&lt;/a&gt; said that the party President &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Hae-chan\"&gt;Lee Hae-chan&lt;/a&gt; dissuaded Woo for entering the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Jae-in%20cabinet\"&gt;Cabinet&lt;/a&gt;. On 11 March, Lee revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20House\"&gt;Blue House&lt;/a&gt; was not willing to appoint too many long-term MPs into the Cabinet.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"2020%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2020 election&lt;/a&gt;, Woo faced the 6th challenge from Lee Seong-heon, whom he defeated with 47,980 votes. He was one of the Democratic MPs supported &lt;a href=\"Yoon%20Mee-hyang\"&gt;Yoon Mee-hyang&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 8 June 2021, Woo was one of 12 MPs expelled or received a \"quit order\" from the party. This was following a controversy of breaching the Agricultural Land Act. The incident occurred when he acquired an agricultural land to bury his mother's body after her death in 2013. He, however, did not accept the party's decision, indicating that he is farming at there.\nSeoul mayorship bid.\nFirst bid (2018).\nOn 21 January 2018, Woo announced his intention to run for the Seoul mayorship in the &lt;a href=\"2018%20South%20Korean%20local%20elections\"&gt;upcoming local election&lt;/a&gt;. He was the first Democratic pre-candidate to launch a bid. He said, \"I will run for the Seoul mayorship to help the success of the Moon Jae-in government and change the world\". He indicated that citizens are disapproving the then incumbent &lt;a href=\"Park%20Won-soon\"&gt;Park Won-soon&lt;/a&gt;'s intention to run for the 3rd term.\nOn 11 March, Woo officially launched his bid at &lt;a href=\"Sejong%20Centre%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts\"&gt;Sejong Centre for the Performing Arts&lt;/a&gt;. He cited that the gap between so-called \"&lt;a href=\"3%20districts%20of%20Gangnam\"&gt;3 districts of Gangnam&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Gangnam%20District\"&gt;Gangnam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seocho%20District\"&gt;Seocho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Songpa%20District\"&gt;Songpa&lt;/a&gt;)\" and the rest has become wider, and pledged he would balance both areas. He added he would overcome daily issues, for example, (several taxi drivers') refusals to accept passengers, &lt;a href=\"child%20abuse\"&gt;child abuse&lt;/a&gt;, and property bid rigging. He also ensured that he would focus on childcare issues, so that children shall be prioritised and mothers will feel comfortable.\nHowever, in the Democratic preselection on 20 April, Woo could only secure 14.14% and came as 3rd. Park Won-soon was officially selected as the Democratic Seoul mayorship candidate with 66.26%. Initially, the party had already put a rule for preselections, where the incumbent MPs would face 10% of vote deductions in order to maintain its \"largest party in the National Assembly\" status, and this was applicable for both Woo Sang-ho and &lt;a href=\"Park%20Young-sun\"&gt;Park Young-sun&lt;/a&gt;. The day, Woo conceded his defeat and congratulated to Park Won-soon.\nSecond bid (2021).\nThe unexpected death of Park Won-soon on 10 July 2020 provoked the &lt;a href=\"2021%20Seoul%20mayoral%20election\"&gt;by-election on 7 April 2021&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 13 December 2020, Woo again announced his intention to run for the Seoul mayorship. He also became the first Democratic pre-candidate launched a bid. He indicated that this would be the last election for him, and would not run for the &lt;a href=\"2024%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2024 general election&lt;/a&gt; regardless of any reasons. Following are his manifestos:\nOn 5 February 2021, the Democratic Party has confirmed that Woo Sang-ho and &lt;a href=\"Park%20Young-sun\"&gt;Park Young-sun&lt;/a&gt; would be the pre-candidate for preselection.\nOn 23 February, Woo visited the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Confederation%20of%20Trade%20Unions\"&gt;Korean Confederation of Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt; (KCTU) Seoul branch. He said, \"I was supposed to join labour movements, but then shifted to student movements because all of my juniors were arrested.\" He emphasised himself as a \"people- and labour-friendly candidate\", citing that he is the sole candidate released labour manifestos. Before this, he has already announced his \"7 Labour Manifestos\" on 7 February, they are: preparing labour criteria of Seoul, establishing the Civil Labour Council, expanding rest areas for &lt;a href=\"migrant%20worker\"&gt;migrant worker&lt;/a&gt;s, expanding pro-youth public sectors, establishing the Seoul Labour Safety and Health Centre, continuing \"Pro-Labour Metropolitan City\" project, and forming the Labour Politics Association.\nCandidate unity.\nOn 12 January 2021, Woo signed for an agreement with an &lt;a href=\"Open%20Democratic%20Party\"&gt;Open Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (ODP) MP &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Jinai\"&gt;Kim Jinai&lt;/a&gt;, stating that both parties will put only one candidate if both of them are elected their parties candidates respectively. On 7 February, he met &lt;a href=\"Chung%20Bong-ju\"&gt;Chung Bong-ju&lt;/a&gt;, the ODP pre-candidate, and again agreed to put a single candidate but with a condition, which is that both parties must be merged.\nEndorsements.\nOn 4 January 2021, Woo was endorsed by the former &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Staff%20to%20the%20President%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;Chief of Staff to the President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Im%20Jong-seok\"&gt;Im Jong-seok&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 17 February, &lt;a href=\"Kwak%20Sang-uhn\"&gt;Kwak Sang-uhn&lt;/a&gt;, the son-in-law to the former President Roh Moo-hyun, endorsed Woo.\nResult.\nWoo received 30.44% and lost to Park Young-sun, who obtained 69.56%, in Democratic preselection on 1 March. He was defeated by Park in both party member votes and opinion polling. He subsequently conceded his defeat and congratulated Park for winning the preselection.\nPolitical positions.\nA notable politician of the 386 Generations (also called as 486 or 586 depends on decades), Woo is widely described as a &lt;a href=\"centrism\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt;. He has been regarded as a \"factionless\" politician, and also critical to faction politics. On 19 March 2013, he announced the dissolution of the Progressive Action, a faction formed by 486 politicians within the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%2C%202011%29\"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; (DUP), and urged the party to stop faction politics. Shortly after the 2016 election and being elected the parliamentary leader of the Democratic Party, he warned those new MPs to get rid of faction politics. Nevertheless, he categorises himself as a pro-Roh Moo-hyun.\n&lt;a href=\"LGBT\"&gt;LGBT&lt;/a&gt; issue.\nPrior to 2021 Seoul mayoral election, Woo joined a meeting held at the &lt;a href=\"Korea%20National%20Assembly%20Proceeding%20Hall\"&gt;National Assembly Proceeding Hall&lt;/a&gt;, along with Park Young-sun and the Democratic Party president &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Nak-yon\"&gt;Lee Nak-yon&lt;/a&gt;. When he was questioned by reporters regarding Queer Culture Festival, he replied, \"I haven't considered the issue as I'm not elected yet, but will think about.\"\nCapital punishment.\nWoo opposes &lt;a href=\"Capital%20punishment%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;capital punishment&lt;/a&gt; and supports to abolish it. On 20 March 2009, he posted on his website about the past life at prison. During that time, he met 2 condemned criminals jailed for multiple murder in 1986. One of them named Goh Keum-seok was a devout &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; who used to share foods provided to other prisoners, and were able to calm another condemned criminals down. Woo added that Goh was able to communicate with several warders. Goh was later executed. He later explained that since the incident, he felt somehow sceptical towards capital punishment.\nForeign affairs.\n&lt;a href=\"Iraq%20war\"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20war\"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt; had begun, the South Korean government was considering to dispatch their troops to &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, Woo was one of the vocal critics opposed the dispatch. During an interview with People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, he condemned the dispatch as \"reasonless and horrible\", adding that \"there must be massacres against the prisoners, as well as mistaken bombing against the civilians\". However, after the government had already sent their troops, he changed his opinion, saying that \"it's easy to oppose, but was inevitable when considering the situation of Korea\". His decision was criticised by several activities. Nevertheless, he was one of the Uri MPs condemned the then &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; for rationalising the war.\n&lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter being elected the parliamentary leader in 2016, Woo promised, \"I will say what I have to say to &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;.\" He denounced the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Korea\"&gt;7th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea&lt;/a&gt; as \"illogical\", adding that \"denuclearisation while boosting nuclear armament is an unacceptable double standard.\" He again criticised North Korea in February 2017 when the neighbouring country shot a missile shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Inauguration%20of%20Donald%20Trump\"&gt;inauguration of the newly elected US President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;. He indicated that the &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations\"&gt;relationship between North Korea and the United States&lt;/a&gt; has been worsen due to the preemptive shootings of North Korea. He added that the preemptive shootings would only boost the international sanctions.\nIn March 2017, Woo requested the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;United States government&lt;/a&gt; to adopt a hybrid policy towards North Korea, which mixes both sanctions and negotiations.\n&lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, the South Korean government prohibited the entry of all foreigners visited &lt;a href=\"Hubei\"&gt;Hubei&lt;/a&gt; starting from 4 February 2020. While several politicians criticised the decision as \"too late\", Woo appeared on \"&lt;a href=\"Kim%20Ou-joon%27s%20News%20Factory\"&gt;Kim Ou-joon's News Factory&lt;/a&gt;\" on 3 February and said, \"It's same as no one would enter if South Korea had already cut a tie with China since the beginning. Politicians are not supposed to say like that.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn February 2013, Woo held Dokdo Photography Exhibition at the National Assembly Proceeding Hall for 3 days (20-22) to protest against &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s so-called \"Takeshima Day\" celebrations. He condemned the &lt;a href=\"Shimane\"&gt;Shimane&lt;/a&gt; prefectural government for infringing of South Korea's sovereignty. He assured that the &lt;a href=\"Liancourt%20Rocks\"&gt;Liancourt Rocks&lt;/a&gt; (called as \"Dokdo\" in South Korea, and \"Takeshima\" in Japan) belongs to South Korea, and indicated that it is impossible for \"&lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Hinomaru&lt;/a&gt;\" to fly at the islands.\nControversies.\n&lt;a href=\"Millennial%20NHK%20incident\"&gt;Millennial NHK incident&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 17 May 2000, several Millennium Democratic Party (MDP) MPs along with Woo Sang-ho and a poet &lt;a href=\"Park%20Nohae\"&gt;Park Nohae&lt;/a&gt; went to a karaoke bar named Millennial NHK after the eve memorial ceremony of the &lt;a href=\"Gwangju%20Uprising\"&gt;Gwangju Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. This incident was revealed after &lt;a href=\"Lim%20Su-kyung\"&gt;Lim Su-kyung&lt;/a&gt; described it on the Internet. According to the post, Woo was swearing to Lim while being drunk. He and other MPs involved subsequently faced public backlashes. He later revealed that he had already apologised to public, as well as another people involved.\n&lt;a href=\"Song%20Seung-heon\"&gt;Song Seung-heon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"conscription%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;national service&lt;/a&gt; issue.\nOn 27 October 2004, several Uri Party MPs from the &lt;a href=\"Culture%2C%20Sports%20and%20Tourism%20Committee\"&gt;Culture and Tourism Committee&lt;/a&gt; including Woo had sent a letter to the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Manpower%20Administration\"&gt;Military Manpower Administration&lt;/a&gt; (MMA); the letter urged the MMA to delay the enlistment date of an actor &lt;a href=\"Song%20Seung-heon\"&gt;Song Seung-heon&lt;/a&gt; to take a role in a drama named \"&lt;a href=\"Sad%20Love%20Story\"&gt;Sad Love Story&lt;/a&gt;\". During that time, Song was under fire for defaulting the national service. Woo indicated, \"If the issue is not settled, there will be negative consequences to the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20wave\"&gt;Korean wave&lt;/a&gt;.\" He was subsequently criticised by netizens.\nSong was replaced to &lt;a href=\"Yeon%20Jung-hoon\"&gt;Yeon Jung-hoon&lt;/a&gt; following the incident.\nViolations of &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"standard%20operating%20procedure\"&gt;SOP&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOn 4 February 2021, Woo again provoked a controversy when he took a photo with 15 other people including another MPs and several district mayors in &lt;a href=\"Seoul\"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sindorim%20Station\"&gt;Sindorim Station&lt;/a&gt;. In the photo, all of them were holding hands each other without practicing &lt;a href=\"social%20distancing\"&gt;social distancing&lt;/a&gt;. The same day, he apologised, said that he was \"inattentive\".\nOn 8 April, a day after the by-election, Woo was reported that he and his companion were drinking with 4 other people at a BBQ restaurant in &lt;a href=\"Central%20District%2C%20Seoul\"&gt;Central District, Seoul&lt;/a&gt;, which is not allowed under the law (only up to 5 people per table are allowed). Regarding this incident, he explained that he went to the restaurant along with 3 other people to have a dinner, but 4 people at another table described themselves as his \"supporter\", so he sat there for 5 minutes. The People Power Party (PPP), however, criticised his explanation and urged him to apologise.\nComment on Kang Nan-hee's letter.\nOn 10 February 2021, Woo once again provoked a controversy when he wrote his opinion about a letter of Kang Nan-hee (widow of the former Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon) on his &lt;a href=\"Facebook\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote, \"I've seen Ms Kang Nan-hee's letter reported on media. Park Won-soon is my comrade from now (when I'm writing this post) till my death.\" He added, \"I was almost crying while gritting my teeth. How hard he was! How could he bear!\" He also indicated, \"The late Park was my role model for an innovation, as well as a comrade discussing democracy and human rights together.\" Finally, he ended, \"I will be the one to continue his policies and develop his dreams.\"\nThe post was widely regarded as \"another harassment\" against the victim, as Park committed suicide following an allegation of &lt;a href=\"sexual%20harassment\"&gt;sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt;s. It was subsequently condemned by opposition parties i.e. the &lt;a href=\"People%20Power%20Party%20%28South%20Korea%29\"&gt;People Power Party&lt;/a&gt; (PPP) and the Justice Party (JP). &lt;a href=\"Cho%20Eun-hee%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Cho Eun-hee&lt;/a&gt;, the Mayor of Seocho and one of the PPP pre-candidate for the Seoul mayorship, questioned him, \"Are you going to continue Park's sexual harassments?\" &lt;a href=\"Oh%20Shin-hwan\"&gt;Oh Shin-hwan&lt;/a&gt;, another PPP pre-candidate, denounced Woo that \"he would like to provoke another harassments\" and urged him to immediately resign. &lt;a href=\"Ahn%20Cheol-soo\"&gt;Ahn Cheol-soo&lt;/a&gt;, the most favourable opposition pre-candidate, asked the Democratic Party to drop the \"mad candidate\", referring Woo. Following the public criticisms, Woo explained that he was consoling Park's bereaved family members and not advocating the late's sexual harassments.\nOn 18 February, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Gender%20Equality%20and%20Family\"&gt;Minister of Gender Equality and Family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chung%20Young-ai\"&gt;Chung Young-ai&lt;/a&gt; indicated that Woo's remark is \"another harassment\".\nPersonal life.\nWoo married Lee Hyun-joo in 1991. Initially, her father, Lee Hwan-jong, opposed the marriage as his daughter was earning a living to a so-called \"demonstrator\" Woo. He is currently living in &lt;a href=\"Seongbuk%20District\"&gt;Seongbuk&lt;/a&gt;, although he enjoys most of time in Seodaemun (Woo's constituency).\nFollowing their marriage in 1991, both Woo and Lee used to live together with Ahn Nae-sang, a famous actor. Both have 3 children \u2014 Woo Jong-hyuk, Woo Jong-ha and Woo Ji-soo. He also has a pet dog, named Woo Bom.\nWoo is also a &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; and the incumbent Deacon of &lt;a href=\"Yeonhui-dong%2C%20Seoul\"&gt;Yeonhui-dong&lt;/a&gt; Church.\nHe is a smoker.\nOn 27 December 2020, it was reported that Woo had a close contact with a COVID-19 patient during an event. Although he was tested negative, he underwent 14-day voluntary self-quarantine. His quarantine period ended on 7 January 2021."
