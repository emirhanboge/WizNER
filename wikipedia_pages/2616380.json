    "text": "The National Fed Challenge is an academic competition that provides high school students (grades 9-12) with an insider's view of how the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"central%20bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Reserve\"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, makes &lt;a href=\"monetary%20policy\"&gt;monetary policy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fed Challenge begins with regional and district rounds of competition. Each Fed Challenge team, consisting of three to five students, presents an analysis of the current state of the economy backed by current economic data and a monetary policy recommendation for the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Open%20Market%20Committee\"&gt;Federal Open Market Committee&lt;/a&gt; (FOMC). Following the presentation, judges question each team about their presentation and their knowledge of macroeconomic theory. Federal Reserve Bank economists and officers judge the district competitions.\nOne Fed Challenge team from each of the four participating Federal Reserve Districts competes at the national competition in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; FOMC members \u2014 Federal Reserve Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents \u2014 judge the national finals.\nThe competition was created in 1994 by Lloyd Bromberg, the Director of Education Programs at the New York Fed.\nSince its peak in 1998 with ten district participants, the Federal Reserve Challenge participation has shrunk to three district participants (as of 2010). In 2009, the National Finals consisted of &lt;a href=\"Choate%20Rosemary%20Hall\"&gt;Choate Rosemary Hall&lt;/a&gt; (Boston District), &lt;a href=\"Brebuef%20Jesuit%20Preparatory%20Academy\"&gt;Brebuef Jesuit Preparatory Academy&lt;/a&gt; (Chicago District), &lt;a href=\"Montclair%20High%20School%20%28New%20Jersey%29\"&gt;Montclair High School&lt;/a&gt; (New York District), and &lt;a href=\"Collegiate%20School%20%28Richmond%2C%20Virginia%29\"&gt;Collegiate School&lt;/a&gt; (Richmond District)."
