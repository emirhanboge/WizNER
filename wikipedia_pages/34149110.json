Nonetheless, he was afterward recognized as an &lt;a href=\"All-American\"&gt;All-American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"return%20specialist\"&gt;return specialist&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012, he was an honorable mention All-Big 12 performer for the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football%20team\"&gt;2012 team&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, he was a first team All-Big 12 performer for the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football%20team\"&gt;2013 team&lt;/a&gt; at both wide receiver and all-purpose receiver. That season, he established Kansas State school records for single-game receiving yards, single game &lt;a href=\"all-purpose%20yards\"&gt;all-purpose yards&lt;/a&gt; and career kickoff return yards. As a senior for the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football%20team\"&gt;2014 team&lt;/a&gt;, he surpassed his own father's school records for career receiving yards, career receptions and career receiving touchdowns.

As a sophomore, he had several notable contributions to the team on its way to the school's first football OSSAA championship in 24 years. As a junior, Lockett played most of the year with a broken wrist that had at first been diagnosed as a severe sprain. He suffered the injury in the second game of the football season and did not have a screw put in his wrist until after basketball season. Booker T.

Washington defeated &lt;a href=\"El%20Reno%20High%20School\"&gt;El Reno High School&lt;/a&gt; 72\u201359 to win the 2011 OSSA 5A Championship. He was voted to the all-tournament second team. In &lt;a href=\"track%20%26amp%3B%20field\"&gt;track &amp; field&lt;/a&gt;, Lockett was one of the state's top &lt;a href=\"sprint%20%28running%29\"&gt;sprinters&lt;/a&gt;. He captured a regional title in the &lt;a href=\"100-meter%20dash\"&gt;100-meter dash&lt;/a&gt; at the 2011 State 5A Regional, placing first with a time of 10.85 seconds.

He chose Kansas State over a scholarship offer from &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Jayhawks%20football\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollege career.\nLockett received an &lt;a href=\"athletic%20scholarship\"&gt;athletic scholarship&lt;/a&gt; to attend &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20State%20University\"&gt;Kansas State University&lt;/a&gt;, where he played for coach &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Snyder\"&gt;Bill Snyder&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football\"&gt;Kansas State Wildcats football&lt;/a&gt; team from &lt;a href=\"2011%20Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football%20team\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"2014%20Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football%20team\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;. Both his father Kevin and uncle Aaron played wide receiver for the Wildcats under Snyder. The Wildcats' receivers coach Michael Smith has also coached Lockett, his father, and his uncle.\nFreshman season (2011).\nHe had hoped to &lt;a href=\"redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29\"&gt;redshirt&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"2011%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season\"&gt;2011 season&lt;/a&gt;, which was his freshman year, so that he could add size. He played in 2011 as a true freshman and got off to a modest start. Lockett only recorded four receptions for 50 yards, three rushes for nine yards, one kickoff return for ten yards, and two punt returns for a total of 13 yards in his first five games through October 8. Things started to turn around on October 15 when he posted a 100-&lt;a href=\"return%20yards\"&gt;yard return&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;kickoff&lt;/a&gt; for a touchdown against &lt;a href=\"2011%20Texas%20Tech%20Red%20Raiders%20football%20team\"&gt;Texas Tech&lt;/a&gt;. Over the ensuing weeks, he earned numerous &lt;a href=\"Big%2012%20Conference\"&gt;Big 12 Conference&lt;/a&gt; honors for the 2011 team, including becoming a two-time Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Week. His first Player of the Week recognition came on October 24 after he produced a 251-yard &lt;a href=\"all-purpose%20yards\"&gt;all-purpose yards&lt;/a&gt; performance on October 22 against &lt;a href=\"2011%20Kansas%20Jayhawks%20football%20team\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Governor%27s%20Cup%20%28Kansas%29\"&gt;Governor's Cup&lt;/a&gt; that included posting a 97-yard kickoff return touchdown while becoming the first player in school history to return kickoffs for &lt;a href=\"touchdown\"&gt;touchdown&lt;/a&gt;s in consecutive games and having a career-high five-reception 110-yard receiving day.

Due to what was at first an undisclosed injury, he did not play in the final three games of Kansas State's regular season. Later, the injury was determined to be a lacerated &lt;a href=\"kidney\"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt;. In the four games before the injury, he had at least three receptions and 125 all-purpose yards in each game.\nHe was the Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year, a second-team All-Big 12 selection as a kickoff returner/punt returner, and an honorable mention selection as a wide receiver. He was a first-team All-American selection by \"&lt;a href=\"Sporting%20News\"&gt;Sporting News&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Camp%20Football%20Foundation\"&gt;Walter Camp Football Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and a second-team All-American selection by &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Sports\"&gt;CBS Sports&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Sports%20Illustrated\"&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/a&gt;\". As a result of the extent of his honors, he was recognized as a consensus All-American by the NCAA. He also picked up numerous All-Freshman honors from \"Sporting News\", &lt;a href=\"Football%20Writers%20Association%20of%20America\"&gt;Football Writers Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (FWAA), &lt;a href=\"CBS%20Sports\"&gt;CBS Sports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rivals.com\"&gt;Rivals.com&lt;/a&gt; (2nd team) and \"&lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20News\"&gt;College Football News&lt;/a&gt;\" (honorable mention, WR). Lockett failed to play in 75 percent of the Wildcats' games in order to be eligible to be the NCAA statistical leader for average kickoff return yardage. Although Lockett averaged 35.19 yards per return (16 returns for 563 yards), another freshman, &lt;a href=\"Raheem%20Mostert\"&gt;Raheem Mostert&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2011%20Purdue%20Boilermakers%20football%20team\"&gt;Purdue&lt;/a&gt;, led the NCAA statistical category with a 33.48 average.\nSophomore season (2012).\nLockett entered the season as a preseason All-Big 12 first team selection by the Big 12 media as a kickoff returner, but &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; only listed him as an honorable mention selection, giving the first team honor to Oklahoma State's &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Gilbert\"&gt;Justin Gilbert&lt;/a&gt;.

His fourth career kickoff return touchdown occurred on November 3 against &lt;a href=\"2012%20Oklahoma%20State%20Cowboys%20football%20team\"&gt;Oklahoma State&lt;/a&gt;.
