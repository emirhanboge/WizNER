    "text": "Friedrichshain () is a quarter (\"Ortsteil\") of the borough of &lt;a href=\"Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg\"&gt;Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, Germany. From its creation in 1920 until 2001, it was a freestanding &lt;a href=\"Boroughs%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;city borough&lt;/a&gt;. Formerly part of &lt;a href=\"East%20Berlin\"&gt;East Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, it is adjacent to &lt;a href=\"Mitte\"&gt;Mitte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prenzlauer%20Berg\"&gt;Prenzlauer Berg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kreuzberg\"&gt;Kreuzberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lichtenberg\"&gt;Lichtenberg&lt;/a&gt;.\nFriedrichshain is named after the \"&lt;a href=\"Volkspark%20Friedrichshain\"&gt;Volkspark Friedrichshain&lt;/a&gt;\", a vast green park at the northern border with Prenzlauer Berg. In the &lt;a href=\"Nazism\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; era, the borough was called \"&lt;a href=\"Horst%20Wessel\"&gt;Horst-Wessel&lt;/a&gt;-Stadt\". Friedrichshain is one of the trendy districts of Berlin and has experienced &lt;a href=\"gentrification\"&gt;gentrification&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nFriedrichshain is defined by the following roads and places, starting clock-wise in the west: Lichtenberger Stra\u00dfe, Mollstra\u00dfe, Otto-Braun-Stra\u00dfe, Am Friedrichshain, Virchowstra\u00dfe, Margarete-Sommer-Stra\u00dfe, Danziger Stra\u00dfe, Landsberger Allee, Hausburgstra\u00dfe, Thaerstra\u00dfe, Eldenaer Stra\u00dfe, S-Bahn-Trasse, Kynaststra\u00dfe, Stralauer Halbinsel, Spree.\nHistory.\nThe largely working-class district was created in 1920 when &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Berlin\"&gt;Greater Berlin&lt;/a&gt; was established by &lt;a href=\"referendum\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt;, incorporating several surrounding settlements. Friedrichshain united the Frankfurter Vorstadt, already part of Berlin, and the villages of Boxhagen and Stralau. It took its name (meaning 'Frederick's Grove') from the \"Volkspark\" ('People's Park'), which was planned in 1840 to commemorate the centenary of &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20the%20Great\"&gt;Frederick the Great&lt;/a&gt;'s coronation. Much of the district was settled in the rapid &lt;a href=\"industrialization\"&gt;industrialization&lt;/a&gt; of the 19th and early 20th centuries, led by growth in manufacturing and crafts. It owed much to the opening of the railway line between Berlin and &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20%28Oder%29\"&gt;Frankfurt (Oder)&lt;/a&gt; in 1846 (which terminated near the site of today's &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Ostbahnhof\"&gt;Berlin Ostbahnhof&lt;/a&gt;), and the opening of the first waterworks in 1865 at Stralauer Tor. In 1874 the \"Krankenhaus im Friedrichshain\" was opened, Berlin's first hospital beside the university clinic &lt;a href=\"Charit%C3%A9\"&gt;Charit\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. In the early 1900s, the district's largest employer was the &lt;a href=\"Knorr-Bremse\"&gt;Knorr-Bremse&lt;/a&gt; brake factory; the Knorrpromenade, one of Friedrichshain's most attractive streets, was built to house the management. The street network of Friedrichhain was originally specified in the &lt;a href=\"Hobrecht-Plan\"&gt;Hobrecht-Plan&lt;/a&gt; and the area was part of what came to be known architecturally as the &lt;a href=\"Wilhelmine%20Ring%20%28Berlin%29\"&gt;Wilhelmine Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Nazism\"&gt;Nazis&lt;/a&gt; came to power in 1933, the district was renamed &lt;a href=\"Horst%20Wessel\"&gt;Horst-Wessel-Stadt&lt;/a&gt; after the Nazi activist and writer of the &lt;a href=\"Horst%20Wessel%20Song\"&gt;Nazi hymn&lt;/a&gt; whose slow death, after being shot by communists, in Friedrichshain hospital in 1930 was turned into a &lt;a href=\"propaganda\"&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt; event by &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Goebbels\"&gt;Joseph Goebbels&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring World War II Friedrichshain was one of the most badly damaged parts of Berlin, as Allied &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20bombing%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;strategic bombers&lt;/a&gt; specifically targeted its industries. As late as the nineties, some buildings still displayed bullet holes from the intense &lt;a href=\"Urban%20warfare\"&gt;house to house fighting&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;Battle of Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. After the war ended, the boundary between the US and &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Allied-occupied%20Germany\"&gt;occupation sectors&lt;/a&gt; ran between Friedrichshain and &lt;a href=\"Kreuzberg\"&gt;Kreuzberg&lt;/a&gt;, with Friedrichshain in the east and Kreuzberg in the west. This became a sealed border between &lt;a href=\"East%20Berlin\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"West%20Berlin\"&gt;West Berlin&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Wall\"&gt;Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt; was built in 1961.\n&lt;a href=\"Stalinallee\"&gt;Stalinallee&lt;/a&gt; (previously Gro\u00dfe Frankfurter Stra\u00dfe) was built in Friedrichshain in the late 1940s and early 1950s as a prestige project; the architecture of its 'workers' palaces' is strongly reminiscent of the ostentatious &lt;a href=\"Stalinist%20architecture\"&gt;Soviet-era Moscow boulevards&lt;/a&gt; and is sometimes mockingly described as \"Zuckerb\u00e4ckerstil\" ('wedding cake style'). The &lt;a href=\"Uprising%20of%201953%20in%20East%20Germany\"&gt;1953 uprising&lt;/a&gt; had its origins in these construction projects, as increased work quotas led to protests that soon spread throughout &lt;a href=\"German%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and were only put down by armed Soviet intervention.\nIn the period of &lt;a href=\"De-Stalinization\"&gt;De-Stalinization&lt;/a&gt; following the Soviet leader's death, the boulevard was renamed &lt;a href=\"Karl-Marx-Allee\"&gt;Karl-Marx-Allee&lt;/a&gt; at one end and &lt;a href=\"Frankfurter%20Allee\"&gt;Frankfurter Allee&lt;/a&gt; at the other. From this time onwards, Friedrichshain often featured on East Berlin's cultural map: in 1962 the \"Kosmos\", East Germany's largest cinema, was opened, followed in 1981 by the country's most ambitious swimming and sports complex, the \"Sport- und Erholungszentrum\". Neither of these buildings serve their original function today.\nLifestyle.\n&lt;a href=\"Die%20Wende\"&gt;In the course of the changes&lt;/a&gt; following the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Wall\"&gt;Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt; in November 1989, the &lt;a href=\"1990%20East%20German%20general%20election\"&gt;free elections in March 1990&lt;/a&gt; and leading up to &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt; the following October, Friedrichshain began to develop a reputation as a young, dynamic district, thanks in part to low rents and the many empty apartments that also attracted the attention of &lt;a href=\"squatter\"&gt;squatter&lt;/a&gt;s including many from former West Berlin. On 14 November that year, Friedrichshain experienced violent clashes when hundreds of squatters were forcefully evicted from houses in \"Mainzer Stra\u00dfe\" by police acting on the orders of the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%23Government\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; of the recently united city, an act which would trigger the fall of the governing coalition when the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%2790/The%20Greens\"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; withdrew in protest. In the following years further squatters were evicted under the hardline &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democratic%20Union%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B6rg%20Sch%C3%B6nbohm\"&gt;Senator for the Interior&lt;/a&gt;, but others were able to buy the houses they lived in, and they remain a distinct (counter-)cultural influence in the district to this day.\nAlongside the neighboring districts of &lt;a href=\"Mitte\"&gt;Mitte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prenzlauer%20Berg\"&gt;Prenzlauer Berg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kreuzberg\"&gt;Kreuzberg&lt;/a&gt;, Friedrichshain is now considered one of Berlin's most fashionable areas, and is home to numerous design and media companies including MTV Central Europe. It is known for its many bars, clubs, pubs, and cafes, concentrated in the vicinity of Simon-Dach-Stra\u00dfe and Boxhagener Platz. There were numerous &lt;a href=\"squatting\"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt; in Friedrichshain, with many in and around Rigaer Stra\u00dfe, Mainzer Stra\u00dfe and Scharnweberstra\u00dfe. In contrast to the districts of Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte, which have experienced high levels of demographic change and rented accommodation is higher, it is only since the late 1990s that Friedrichshain has undergone a similar trend. Following &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt;, the availability of comparatively cheap rented accommodation attracted students and artists. Nowadays numerous restoration works are under way and Friedrichshain is developing at a fast pace becoming more and &lt;a href=\"gentrification\"&gt;more gentrified&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nAt the opposite end of the district, the \"Volkspark Friedrichshain\" is a large park serving the densely populated area of Prenzlauer Berg on the other side. Its distinctive features include the \"M\u00e4rchenbrunnen\" (Fairytale Fountain) and two green and pleasant \"mountains\" consisting purely of rubble and the ruins of two World War II &lt;a href=\"Flak%20tower\"&gt;Flak tower&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPeaceful green oases like the &lt;a href=\"Volkspark%20Friedrichshain\"&gt;Volkspark Friedrichshain&lt;/a&gt; offer opportunities for sports and recreation in leafy nature. The Spreeufer is lovely for walks along the riverside. Concerning its culinary offerings, this area also boasts a great choice of restaurants in all price ranges as well as many charming caf\u00e9s. Culture lovers enjoy this neighborhood because of various small exhibition spaces, venues, cinemas and the Berlin Kriminal Theater that specializes in crime stories. &lt;a href=\"Frankfurter%20Allee\"&gt;Frankfurter Allee&lt;/a&gt; features various shopping facilities as well as the Ring-Center shopping mall."
