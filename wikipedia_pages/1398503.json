    "text": "Sibel Deniz Edmonds is a former contract &lt;a href=\"translator\"&gt;translator&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation\"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (FBI) and the founder and editor-in-chief of the independent news website NewsBud.\nThe FBI hired her as a translator shortly after &lt;a href=\"September%2011%20attacks\"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt; but fired her after less than seven months. She identified herself as a &lt;a href=\"whistleblower\"&gt;whistleblower&lt;/a&gt; and challenged her termination; however, the courts dismissed her lawsuit for wrongful termination because the FBI would need to disclose privileged information. She accused a colleague of covering up illicit activity involving Turkish nationals, alleged serious security breaches and cover-ups and that intelligence had been deliberately suppressed, endangering national security. Following her accusations, the US attorney-general imposed a state secrets privilege order on her, which prevents her from revealing more information about the FBI. The PEN American Center awarded her the PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award in 2006 for her claims. She published a memoir in March 2012, titled \"Classified Woman \u2013 The Sibel Edmonds Story\".\nSibel Edmonds is the founder and publisher of the \"Boiling Frogs Post\", an online media site that claims to offer nonpartisan investigative journalism. In 2016 as editor-in-chief Sibel expanded and founded NewsBud independent news media with associates, partnered with BFP.\nEarly life and education.\nThe daughter of an &lt;a href=\"Iranian%20Azerbaijanis\"&gt;Iranian Azerbaijani&lt;/a&gt; father and &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20people\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; mother, Edmonds lived in Iran and then Turkey before coming to the United States as a student in 1988. Fluent in &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijani%20language\"&gt;Azerbaijani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Persian%20language\"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, Edmonds earned her bachelor's degree in &lt;a href=\"criminal%20justice\"&gt;criminal justice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"psychology\"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"George%20Washington%20University\"&gt;George Washington University&lt;/a&gt; and her master's in &lt;a href=\"public%20policy\"&gt;public policy&lt;/a&gt; and international &lt;a href=\"commerce\"&gt;commerce&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"George%20Mason%20University\"&gt;George Mason University&lt;/a&gt;.\nFBI employment.\nEdmonds worked for the FBI for six months from late September 2001 until March 2002. Edmonds was hired, as a contractor, to work as an interpreter in the translations unit of the FBI in Washington on September 13, September 15, or September 20, 2001. Among her main roles was to translate covertly recorded conversations by Turkish diplomatic and political targets.\nEdmonds filed complaints with the FBI's &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Professional%20Responsibility\"&gt;Office of Professional Responsibility&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice%20Office%20of%20the%20Inspector%20General\"&gt;United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General&lt;/a&gt;. In response, she claims that managers retaliated against her, and she was fired on March 22, 2002. In June 2002, the &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that the FBI claimed Edmonds was dismissed because her actions were disruptive and breached security and that she performed poorly at her job. A 2005 internal investigation by the FBI Office of the Inspector General found that many of Edmonds's allegations of misconduct \"had some basis in fact\" and that \"her allegations were at least a contributing factor in the FBI's decision to terminate her services,\" but were unable to substantiate all of her allegations, nor did they make a statement regarding her dismissal being improper.\nEdmonds's allegations of impropriety at the FBI later came to the attention of the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary\"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt;, which held unclassified hearings on the matter on June 17, 2002, and July 9, 2002. During the hearings, the FBI provided various unclassified documents and statements relating to the case, which led to Senators &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Leahy\"&gt;Patrick Leahy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chuck%20Grassley\"&gt;Chuck Grassley&lt;/a&gt; sending letters, dated June 19, 2002, August 13, 2002, and October 28, 2002 \u2013 to Inspector General &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20A.%20Fine\"&gt;Glenn A. Fine&lt;/a&gt;, Attorney General &lt;a href=\"John%20Ashcroft\"&gt;Ashcroft&lt;/a&gt;, and FBI Director &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Mueller\"&gt;Robert Mueller&lt;/a&gt;, respectively \u2013 asking for explanations and calling for an independent audit of the FBI's translation unit. These documents were published on the Senators' web sites.\nPost-FBI.\nIn April 2004, Edmonds claimed she had provided information to the panel investigating the &lt;a href=\"September%2011%20attacks\"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt; in February that year. Although she started work shortly after 9/11 and worked for just over six months, she claimed knowledge of information circulating within the FBI during spring and summer of 2001. The session was closed and over three hours long, she said. Reportedly, she told the commission that the FBI knew of a planned attack months away and the terrorists were in place. She stated, \"There was general information about the time-frame, about methods to be used but not specifically about how they would be used and about people being in place and who was ordering these sorts of terror attacks. There were other cities that were mentioned. Major cities with skyscrapers.\" On the 26th, a deposition of Edmonds was quashed under the state secrets privilege.\nOn May 13, 2004, Ashcroft submitted statements to justify the use of the &lt;a href=\"state%20secrets%20privilege\"&gt;state secrets privilege&lt;/a&gt; against the planned deposition by Edmonds, and the same day, the FBI retroactively classified as &lt;a href=\"Top%20Secret\"&gt;Top Secret&lt;/a&gt; all of the material and statements that had been provided to the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee\"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 relating to Edmonds's own lawsuit, as well as the letters that had been sent by the Senators and republished by the &lt;a href=\"Project%20on%20Government%20Oversight\"&gt;Project on Government Oversight&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn June 23, 2004, the retroactive reclassification was challenged in a suit filed by the Project on Government Oversight, citing fear that the group might be retroactively punished for having published the letters on its website. The Justice Department tried to get the suit dismissed, and the Justice Department explicitly approved their release to the Project on Government Oversight. The reclassification did, however, keep Edmonds from testifying in the class action suit as well as her own whistleblower suit. The latter decision was appealed, and Inspector General Glenn A. Fine released a summary of the audit report, claiming \"that many of her allegations were supported, that the FBI did not take them seriously enough, and that her allegations were, in fact, the most significant factor in the FBI's decision to terminate her services. Rather than investigate Edmonds's allegations vigorously and thoroughly, the FBI concluded that she was a disruption and terminated her contract.\"\nIn August 2004, Edmonds founded the &lt;a href=\"National%20Security%20Whistleblowers%20Coalition\"&gt;National Security Whistleblowers Coalition&lt;/a&gt; (NSWBC), which exists to assist national security whistleblowers through advocacy and reform. Edmonds is also the founder and publisher of the \"&lt;a href=\"Boiling%20Frogs%20Post\"&gt;Boiling Frogs Post&lt;/a&gt;\", an online media site that aims to offer nonpartisan investigative journalism.\nIn September 2005, Edmonds claimed in Vanity Fair that a price was set for &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Hastert\"&gt;Dennis Hastert&lt;/a&gt; to withdraw support for the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20genocide\"&gt;Armenian genocide&lt;/a&gt; resolution. That the \"... Turkish Consulate ... claimed in one recording that the price for Hastert to withdraw the resolution would have been at least $500,000.\"\nIn September 2006, a documentary about Edmonds's case called \"&lt;a href=\"Kill%20the%20Messenger%20%282006%20film%29\"&gt;Kill the Messenger&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Une Femme \u00e0 Abattre\") premiered in France. The film discusses the Edmonds case and offers interviews with various involved individuals.\nEdmonds gave testimony in August 2009 and gave information that had twice previously been gagged under state secrets privilege.\nOn February 1, 2011, Edmonds published a story on her own website, adding details of events she described as taking place in April 2001. The account is of another translator's description of meetings with an Iranian informant months before 9/11, and FBI agents' reaction to it:\nEdmonds said that two agents with whom this other translator had worked reported this information to a\n\"Special Agent in Charge (SAC)\" months before the attack. After the attack, one of them told their translator that the SAC \"called us into his office and gave us an order; an absolute order [that] we never got any warnings. Those conversations never existed; it never happened; period. He said this is very sensitive\u2026and that no one should ever mention a word about this case; period.'\"\n\"Classified Woman\".\nIn 2012, she published an autobiography called \"Classified Woman \u2013 The Sibel Edmonds Story: A Memoir\". Reviewing the book for &lt;a href=\"The%20American%20Conservative\"&gt;The American Conservative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Giraldi\"&gt;Philip Giraldi&lt;/a&gt; said that some details of the book could be challenged due to passage of time. However, he felt the central thesis of government incompetence and corruption was correct.\nNewsBud.\nSibel Edmonds, along with others, formed NewsBud, supported by &lt;a href=\"Kickstarter\"&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; donations. Sibel Edmonds's primarily solo Boiling Frogs Post featuring articles and videos is being merged and absorbed into NewsBud \u2013 so BFP content is becoming NewsBud content and NewsBud content occasionally appears as a BFP heading or website."
