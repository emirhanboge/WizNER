    "text": "Daniel Raymond John Potter (born 18 March 1979) is an English retired &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; goalkeeper.\nCareer.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Ipswich\"&gt;Ipswich&lt;/a&gt;, Danny Potter started his career as a trainee at Premiership club &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; but after failing to make the grade there dropped into lower league football with short spells at &lt;a href=\"Chelmsford%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelmsford City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weymouth%20F.C.\"&gt;Weymouth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Exeter%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Exeter City&lt;/a&gt;. He came to prominence when he joined &lt;a href=\"Canvey%20Island%20F.C.\"&gt;Canvey Island&lt;/a&gt; in March 2003 along with &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Boylan\"&gt;Lee Boylan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Purser\"&gt;Wayne Purser&lt;/a&gt; who were with him at Canvey Island, with whom he gained promotion to the Conference, and on a number of occasions proved to be a key player for them with his solid goalkeeping skills. After Canvey dropped out of the Conference, he was signed by &lt;a href=\"Stevenage%20F.C.\"&gt;Stevenage Borough&lt;/a&gt; by new manager &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Stimson\"&gt;Mark Stimson&lt;/a&gt; and promptly impressed in pre-season.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"2006-07%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;2006\u201307&lt;/a&gt; season began, Potter was first choice, with previous first choice &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Julian\"&gt;Alan Julian&lt;/a&gt; struggling with injury and Potter remained first choice until he was sent off against Crawley Town. After the Crawley game, Potter only played in one more game for the first team, a 2\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Burton%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Burton Albion&lt;/a&gt;.\nPotter left to join &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Cambridge United&lt;/a&gt; on 22 May 2007. In his first two seasons with Cambridge, Potter helped steer the side towards successive playoff finals, although he was to miss out on the latter through a knee injury. Following the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2009\u201310&lt;/a&gt; season, Potter was one of nine players released by manager &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Ling\"&gt;Martin Ling&lt;/a&gt;. He joined &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Two\"&gt;League Two&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Torquay%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Torquay United&lt;/a&gt; on 1 July.\nOn 29 May 2011 he joined Conference National side &lt;a href=\"Newport%20County%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Newport County&lt;/a&gt;, the day after being non-playing substitute for Torquay when they lost 1\u20130 in the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Football%20League%20Two%20play-off%20Final\"&gt;2011 Football League Two play-off Final&lt;/a&gt; to Stevenage, at Old Trafford, Manchester. Potter was released by Newport County in March 2012.\nOn 12 March 2012, it was announced Potter had signed for Conference South side &lt;a href=\"Staines%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Staines Town&lt;/a&gt;. Three months later, Potter signed for league rivals &lt;a href=\"Eastbourne%20Borough%20F.C.\"&gt;Eastbourne Borough&lt;/a&gt;. He left Eastbourne by mutual consent after playing seven games, due to changes in his personal life which made it difficult for him to continue playing for the club.\nAfter leaving Eastbourne Potter joined &lt;a href=\"Leiston%20F.C.\"&gt;Leiston&lt;/a&gt; in the Isthmian League. Potter rejoined Eastbourne later in the same season. He retired from football after finishing the 2012\u201313 season at Eastbourne.\nAfter three years in retirement, Potter made one league appearance for Leiston in a 2\u20132 draw with &lt;a href=\"Tonbridge%20Angels%20F.C.\"&gt;Tonbridge Angels&lt;/a&gt; on 20 September 2016 and the 2\u20131 defeat away to &lt;a href=\"Westfields%20F.C.\"&gt;Westfields&lt;/a&gt; in the FA Cup on 15 October 2016.\nTV role.\nIn 2002, Potter appeared in Sky One's &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Team%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Dream Team&lt;/a&gt;, playing as himself, for fictional club &lt;a href=\"Harchester%20United\"&gt;Harchester United&lt;/a&gt;."
