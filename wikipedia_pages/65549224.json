They &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long and had a &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . They had a diving depth of .\nFor surface running, the submarines were powered by two &lt;a href=\"Sulzer%20%28manufacturer%29\"&gt;Sulzer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s, each driving one &lt;a href=\"propeller%20shaft\"&gt;propeller shaft&lt;/a&gt;. When submerged each propeller was driven by a &lt;a href=\"electric%20motor\"&gt;electric motor&lt;/a&gt;. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, they had a range of \u2014 although the Imperial Japanese Navy officially announced it as \u2014 at ; submerged, they had a range of at .\nThe submarines were armed with four internal bow &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s and carried a total of eight &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es. They were also armed with a single &lt;a href=\"12%20cm/45%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deck gun and one 6.5 mm &lt;a href=\"machine%20gun\"&gt;machine gun&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction and commissioning.\n\"Ro-32\" was &lt;a href=\"Keel-laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; as Submarine No. 71 on 24 October 1921 by &lt;a href=\"Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries\"&gt;Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kobe\"&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;Launched&lt;/a&gt; on 19 March 1923, she was completed and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 31\u00a0May\u00a01924.\nService history.\nUpon commissioning, \"Submarine No. 71\" was attached to the &lt;a href=\"Sasebo%20Naval%20District\"&gt;Sasebo Naval District&lt;/a&gt;, to which she remained attached throughout her active career. On 15 June 1924, she was assigned to both Submarine Division 25 \u2014 in which she spent her active career \u2014 and the &lt;a href=\"Mako%20Defense%20Division\"&gt;Mako Defense Division&lt;/a&gt; headquartered at &lt;a href=\"Magong\"&gt;Mako&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"Formosa\"&gt;Formosa&lt;/a&gt;. She was renamed Ro-32 on 1 November 1924. On 1 December 1926, she was reassigned to the &lt;a href=\"Sasebo%20Defense%20Division\"&gt;Sasebo Defense Division&lt;/a&gt;, headquartered at &lt;a href=\"Sasebo\"&gt;Sasebo&lt;/a&gt;, Japan. Her service in the Sasebo Defense Division ended on 15 November 1934, after which she served as a unit of Submarine Division 25 in the Sasebo Naval District. \n\"Ro-32\" was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20decommissioning\"&gt;decommissioned&lt;/a&gt; and placed in the Fourth Reserve on 15 December 1938. The Japanese struck her from the Navy list on 1 April 1942, and that day she became a stationary &lt;a href=\"Training%20ship\"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hulk%20%28ship%29\"&gt;hulk&lt;/a&gt; at the submarine school at &lt;a href=\"%C5%8Ctake%2C%20Hiroshima\"&gt;\u014ctake&lt;/a&gt;, Japan. She was scrapped ca. August 1945.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;United States Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Coast%20Guard%20Cutter\"&gt;cutter&lt;/a&gt; , the Coast Guard-manned &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yard%20patrol%20boat\"&gt;patrol vessel&lt;/a&gt; , and a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Royal Canadian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bristol%20Bolingbroke\"&gt;Bristol Bolingbroke&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"maritime%20patrol%20aircraft\"&gt;maritime patrol aircraft&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"No.%20115%20Squadron%20RCAF\"&gt;No. 115 Squadron&lt;/a&gt; shared credit for the sinking of a submarine in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; off &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Alaska\"&gt;Southeast Alaska&lt;/a&gt; at on 9 July 1942, and in 1947 the &lt;a href=\"Joint%20Army-Navy%20Assessment%20Committee\"&gt;Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee&lt;/a&gt; identified the sunken submarine as \"Ro-32\". In 1967, the U.S. Navy retracted that finding after determining that \"Ro-32\" had been inactive in Japan at the time of the sinking and had remained afloat through the end of World War II."
