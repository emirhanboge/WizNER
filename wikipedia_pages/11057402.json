    "text": "Sulfolene, or butadiene sulfone is a cyclic &lt;a href=\"Organic%20compound\"&gt;organic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chemical%20compound\"&gt;chemical&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"sulfone\"&gt;sulfone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"functional%20group\"&gt;functional group&lt;/a&gt;. It is a white, odorless, crystalline, indefinitely storable solid, which dissolves in water and many organic solvents. The compound is used as a source of &lt;a href=\"butadiene\"&gt;butadiene&lt;/a&gt;.\nProduction.\nSulfolene is formed via a reversible &lt;a href=\"cheletropic%20reaction\"&gt;cheletropic reaction&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"buta-1%2C3-diene\"&gt;buta-1,3-diene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sulfur%20dioxide\"&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt;. These compounds are first mixed in an autoclave at about \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C with an excess of sulfur dioxide in the presence of small amounts of a phenolic polymerization inhibitor (e.g. &lt;a href=\"hydroquinone\"&gt;hydroquinone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"pyrogallol\"&gt;pyrogallol&lt;/a&gt;) and either allowed to stand at room temperature for days or heated to about 130\u00a0\u00b0C for 30 minutes.\nReactions.\nAcid-base reactivity.\nThe compound is unaffected by acids. It can even be recrystallized from conc. HNO3.\nThe protons in the 2- and 5-positions rapidly exchange with &lt;a href=\"deuterium%20oxide\"&gt;deuterium oxide&lt;/a&gt; under alkaline conditions. &lt;a href=\"Sodium%20cyanide\"&gt;Sodium cyanide&lt;/a&gt; catalyzes this reaction.\nIsomerization to 2-sulfolene.\nUnder basic conditions or when catalyzed by cyanide ions, 3-sulfolene &lt;a href=\"isomer\"&gt;isomer&lt;/a&gt;izes to a mixture of 2-sulfolene and 3-sulfolene. The ratio of 2-sulfolene and 3-sulfolene depends on the ratio of cyanide and sulfolene.\nAt 50\u00a0\u00b0C an equilibrium mixture is obtained containing 42% 3-sulfolene and 58% 2-sulfolene. The thermodynamically more stable 2-sulfolene can be isolated from the mixture of isomers as pure substance in the form of white plates (m.p.\u00a048-49\u00a0\u00b0C) by heating for several days at 100\u00a0\u00b0C, because of the thermal decomposition of the 3-sulfolene at temperatures above 80\u00a0\u00b0C.\nHydrogenation.\nCatalytic hydrogenation yields &lt;a href=\"sulfolane\"&gt;sulfolane&lt;/a&gt;, a solvent used in the &lt;a href=\"petrochemical%20industry\"&gt;petrochemical industry&lt;/a&gt; for the extraction of &lt;a href=\"aromatic\"&gt;aromatic&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"hydrocarbon\"&gt;hydrocarbon&lt;/a&gt; streams. The &lt;a href=\"hydrogenation\"&gt;hydrogenation&lt;/a&gt; of 3-sulfolene over &lt;a href=\"Raney%20nickel\"&gt;Raney nickel&lt;/a&gt; at approx. 20 bar and 60\u00a0\u00b0C gives &lt;a href=\"sulfolane\"&gt;sulfolane&lt;/a&gt; in yields of up to 65% only because of the poisoning of the catalyst by sulfur compounds.\nHalogenation.\n3-Sulfolene reacts in aqueous solution with bromine to give &lt;a href=\"3%2C4-dibromotetrohydrothiophene-1%2C1-dioxide\"&gt;3,4-dibromotetrohydrothiophene-1,1-dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, which can be dehydrobrominated to &lt;a href=\"thiophene-1%2C1-dioxide\"&gt;thiophene-1,1-dioxide&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"silver%20carbonate\"&gt;silver carbonate&lt;/a&gt;. Thiophene-1,1-dioxide, a highly reactive species, is also accessible via the formation of 3,4-bis(dimethylamino)tetrahydrothiophene-1,1-dioxide and successive double quaternization with &lt;a href=\"methyl%20iodide\"&gt;methyl iodide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hofmann%20elimination\"&gt;Hofmann elimination&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"silver%20hydroxide\"&gt;silver hydroxide&lt;/a&gt;.\nA less cumbersome two-step synthesis is the two-fold dehydrobromination of 3,4-dibromotetrohydrothiophene-1,1-dioxide with either powdered sodium hydroxide in &lt;a href=\"tetrahydrofuran\"&gt;tetrahydrofuran&lt;/a&gt; (THF) or with &lt;a href=\"Ultrasound\"&gt;ultrasonically&lt;/a&gt; dispersed metallic &lt;a href=\"potassium\"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiels-Alder reactions.\n3-sulfolene is mainly valued as a stand-in for butadiene. The \"in situ\" production and immediate consumption of 1,3-butadiene largely avoids contact with the diene, which is a gas at room temperature. One potential drawback, aside from expense, is that the evolved sulfur dioxide can cause side reactions with acid-sensitive substrates.\n&lt;a href=\"Diels-Alder%20reaction\"&gt;Diels-Alder reaction&lt;/a&gt; between 1,3-butadiene and dienophiles of low reactivity usually requires prolonged heating above 100\u00a0\u00b0C. Such procedures are rather dangerous. If neat butadiene is used, special equipment for work under elevated pressure is required. With sulfolene no buildup of butadiene pressure could be expected as the liberated diene is consumed in the cycloaddition, and therefore the equilibrium of the reversible extrusion reaction acts as an internal \"safety valve\".\n3-Sulfolene reacts with &lt;a href=\"maleic%20anhydride\"&gt;maleic anhydride&lt;/a&gt; in boiling &lt;a href=\"xylene\"&gt;xylene&lt;/a&gt; to cis-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride, obtaining yields of up to 90%.\n3-Sulfolene reacts also with &lt;a href=\"dienophile\"&gt;dienophile&lt;/a&gt;s in \"trans\" configuration (such as diethyl fumarate) at 110\u00a0\u00b0C with SO2 elimination in 66\u201373% yield to the trans-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic diethyl ester.\n6,7-Dibromo-1,4-epoxy-1,4-dihydronaphthalene (6,7-Dibromonaphthalene-1,4-endoxide, accessible after debromination from &lt;a href=\"1%2C2%2C4%2C5-Tetrabromobenzene\"&gt;1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene&lt;/a&gt; using an equivalent of &lt;a href=\"N-Butyllithium\"&gt;n-butyllithium&lt;/a&gt; and Diels-Alder reaction in &lt;a href=\"furan\"&gt;furan&lt;/a&gt; in 70% yield) reacts with 3-sulfolene in boiling xylene to give a tricyclic adduct. This precursor yields, after treatment with perchloric acid, a dibromo dihydroanthracene which is dehydrogenated in the last step with &lt;a href=\"2%2C3-Dichloro-5%2C6-dicyano-1%2C4-benzoquinone\"&gt;2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone&lt;/a&gt; (DDQ) to 2,3-dibromoanthracene.\n1,3-Butadiene (formed in the retro-cheletrophic reaction of 3-sulfolene) reacts with dehydrobenzene (&lt;a href=\"benzyne\"&gt;benzyne&lt;/a&gt;, obtained by thermal decomposition of benzenediazonium-2-carboxylate) in a Diels-Alder reaction in 9% yield to give 1,4-dihydronaphthalene.\n2- and 3-Sulfolenes as a dienophile.\nIn the presence of very reactive dienes (for example 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran) butadienesulfone behaves as a dienophile and forms the corresponding Diels-Alder adduct.\nAs early as 1938, &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Alder\"&gt;Kurt Alder&lt;/a&gt; and co-workers reported Diels-Alder adducts from the isomeric 2-sulfolene with 1,3-butadiene and 2-sulfolene with &lt;a href=\"cyclopentadiene\"&gt;cyclopentadiene&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther cycloadditions.\nThe base-catalyzed reaction of 3-sulfolene with &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; at 3 bar pressure produces 3-sulfolene-3-carboxylic acid in 45% yield.\nWith &lt;a href=\"diazomethane\"&gt;diazomethane&lt;/a&gt;, 3-sulfolene forms in a 1,3-dipolar cycloadduct:\nPolymerization.\nIn 1935, H. Staudinger and co-workers found that the reaction of butadiene and SO2 at room temperature gives a second product in addition to 3-sulfolene. This second product is an amorphous solid polymer. By free-radical polymerization of 3-sulfolene in peroxide-containing diethyl ether, up to 50% insoluble high-molecular-weight poly-sulfolene was obtained. The polymer resists degradation by sulfuric and nitric acids.\nIn subsequent investigations, polymerization of 3-sulfolene was initiated above 100\u00a0\u00b0C with the radical initiator &lt;a href=\"Azobisisobutyronitrile\"&gt;azobis(isobutyronitrile)&lt;/a&gt; (AIBN). 3-sulfolene does not &lt;a href=\"Copolymerization\"&gt;copolymerize&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Vinyl%20group\"&gt;vinyl compounds&lt;/a&gt;, however. On the other hand, 2-sulfolene does not &lt;a href=\"Homopolymerization\"&gt;homopolymerize&lt;/a&gt;, but forms copolymers with vinyl compounds, e.g. &lt;a href=\"acrylonitrile\"&gt;acrylonitrile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"vinyl%20acetate\"&gt;vinyl acetate&lt;/a&gt;.\n3-Sulfolene as a recyclable solvent.\nThe reversibility of the interconversion of 3-sulfolene with buta-1,3-diene and sulfur dioxide suggests the use of sulfolene as a recyclable aprotic dipolar solvent, in replacement for dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is often used but difficult to separate and poorly reusable. As a model reaction, the reaction of benzyl azide with 4-toluenesulfonic acid cyanide forming 1-benzyl-5-(4-toluenesulfonyl)tetrazole was investigated. The formation of the tetrazole can also be carried out as a one-pot reaction without the isolation of the benzyl azide with 72% overall yield.\nAfter the reaction, the solvent 3-sulfolene is decomposed at 135\u00a0\u00b0C and the volatile butadiene (b.p. \u22124.4\u00a0\u00b0C) and sulfur dioxide (b.p. \u221210.1\u00a0\u00b0C) are deposited in a cooling trap at \u221276\u00a0\u00b0C charged with excess sulfur dioxide. After the addition of hydroquinone as polymerization inhibition, 3-sulfoles is formed again quantitatively upon heating to room temperature. It appears questionable though, if 3-sulfolene with a useful liquid phase range of only 64 to a maximum of about 100\u00a0\u00b0C can be used as DMSO substitutes (easy handling, low cost, environmental compatibility) in industrial practice.\nUses.\nAside from its synthetic versatility (see above), sulfolene is used as an additive in &lt;a href=\"electrochemical%20fluorination\"&gt;electrochemical fluorination&lt;/a&gt;. It can increase the yield of &lt;a href=\"perfluorooctanesulfonyl%20fluoride\"&gt;perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride&lt;/a&gt; by about 70%. It is \"highly soluble in anhydrous HF and increases the conductivity of the electrolyte solution\". In this application, it undergoes a ring opening and is fluorinated to form perfluorobutane&lt;a href=\"Sulfonyl%20halide\"&gt;sulfonyl fluoride&lt;/a&gt;."
