    "text": "Alberweiler Castle is a small castle-like structure in the village of Alberweiler, now part of the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Schemmerhofen\"&gt;Schemmerhofen&lt;/a&gt; in the state of &lt;a href=\"Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg\"&gt;Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. It is situated on a hillside in the centre of the village. The ground and the first floor of the castle are made of stone whereas the upper storeys consist of three projecting &lt;a href=\"Timber%20framing\"&gt;half-timbered&lt;/a&gt; floors.\nHistory.\nA castle is first mentioned in sources dating from the 11th century. It was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Ministerialis\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Graf\"&gt;Counts&lt;/a&gt; of Berg-Wartstein. This early structure was destroyed in 1487 but soon after, towards the end of the 15th century, a new castle was erected at the behest of Bartholome of Warthausen. Some remains of the &lt;a href=\"circular%20rampart\"&gt;circular rampart&lt;/a&gt; are still visible. Following the extinction of the house of Warthausen zu Alberweiler in 1585, the castle was &lt;a href=\"Enfeoffment\"&gt;enfeoffed&lt;/a&gt; to the Counts of &lt;a href=\"Stadion%20%28state%29\"&gt;Stadion&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Rudolf II&lt;/a&gt;. The castle was renovated in early-&lt;a href=\"Baroque\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; style in the 17th century. The &lt;a href=\"Portal%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;gate&lt;/a&gt; was also constructed during these &lt;a href=\"Building%20restoration\"&gt;restoration&lt;/a&gt; works. At around 1700, the castle functioned as residence for the local &lt;a href=\"Vogt\"&gt;reeve&lt;/a&gt;, the Counts of Stadion residing at &lt;a href=\"Warthausen\"&gt;Warthausen Castle&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently went into private ownership during the course of the 18th century. In 1826, the Counts of Stadion sold all rights to the village and the castle to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg\"&gt;Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg&lt;/a&gt;. Following alterations in 1880 the structure slowly began to fall into disrepair. The castle was extensively restored in the late 20th century and is privately owned today."
