    "text": "The College Hero is a 1927 American &lt;a href=\"silent%20film\"&gt;silent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"comedy%20film\"&gt;comedy film&lt;/a&gt; directed by &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Lang\"&gt;Walter Lang&lt;/a&gt;. This is a surviving title contrary to some reports, as it is on video.\nPlot.\nFootball player Bob Cantfield enrolls at Carver College, is assigned Jim Halloran as a roommate and lands a date with Sampson Saunders' attractive sister, Vivian.\nJim's jealousy over Bob's gridiron and girlfriend successes cause him to trip his teammate deliberately and cause Bob to be injured in a game. Bob is still able to score the touchdown that wins Carver the game, after which Jim's conscience gets the better of him."
