    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"category%20theory\"&gt;category theory&lt;/a&gt;, a branch of mathematics, a groupoid object in a &lt;a href=\"category%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;category&lt;/a&gt; \"C\" admitting finite &lt;a href=\"pullback%20%28category%20theory%29\"&gt;fiber product&lt;/a&gt;s is a pair of objects formula_1 together with five &lt;a href=\"morphism\"&gt;morphism&lt;/a&gt;s formula_2 satisfying the following groupoid axioms\nA &lt;a href=\"group%20object\"&gt;group object&lt;/a&gt; is a special case of a groupoid object.\nExamples.\nExample: A groupoid object in the category of sets is precisely a &lt;a href=\"groupoid\"&gt;groupoid&lt;/a&gt; in the usual sense: a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism. Indeed, given such a category \"C\", take \"U\" to be the set of all objects in \"C\", \"R\" the set of all arrows in \"C\", the five morphisms given by formula_10, formula_11, formula_12 and formula_13.\nIncidentally, one can consider a notion of a semigroupoid (unital semigroup = a category with a single object); but, according to this example, that is nothing but a category; so a groupoid object is really a special case of a \"category object\", better known as a &lt;a href=\"stack%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;stack&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"prestack\"&gt;prestack&lt;/a&gt;).\nA groupoid \"S\"-scheme is a groupoid object in the category of &lt;a href=\"scheme%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;scheme&lt;/a&gt;s over some fixed base scheme \"S\". If formula_14, then a groupoid scheme (where formula_15 are necessarily the structure map) is the same as a &lt;a href=\"group%20scheme\"&gt;group scheme&lt;/a&gt;. A groupoid scheme is also called an algebraic groupoid, for example in , to convey the idea it is a generalization of &lt;a href=\"algebraic%20group\"&gt;algebraic group&lt;/a&gt;s and their actions. When the term \"groupoid\" can naturally refer to a groupoid object in some particular category in mind, the term groupoid set is used to refer to a groupoid object in the category of sets.\nExample: Suppose an &lt;a href=\"algebraic%20group\"&gt;algebraic group&lt;/a&gt; \"G\" &lt;a href=\"Group-scheme%20action\"&gt;acts&lt;/a&gt; from the right on a scheme \"U\". Then take formula_16, \"s\" the projection, \"t\" the given action. This determines a groupoid scheme.\nConstruction.\nGiven a groupoid object (\"R\", \"U\"), the equalizer of formula_17, if any, is a group object called the inertia group of the groupoid. The coequalizer of the same diagram, if any, is the quotient of the groupoid.\nEach groupoid object in a category \"C\" (if any) may be thought of as a contravariant functor from \"C\" to the category of groupoids. This way, each groupoid object determines a &lt;a href=\"prestack\"&gt;prestack&lt;/a&gt; in groupoids. This prestack is not a stack but it can be &lt;a href=\"stackification\"&gt;stackified&lt;/a&gt; to yield a stack.\nThe main use of the notion is that it provides an &lt;a href=\"atlas%20%28stack%29\"&gt;atlas&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"stack%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;stack&lt;/a&gt;. More specifically, let formula_18 be the category of &lt;a href=\"torsor%20under%20a%20groupoid\"&gt;formula_19-torsors&lt;/a&gt;. Then it is a &lt;a href=\"category%20fibered%20in%20groupoids\"&gt;category fibered in groupoids&lt;/a&gt;; in fact, (in a nice case), a &lt;a href=\"Deligne%E2%80%93Mumford%20stack\"&gt;Deligne\u2013Mumford stack&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, any DM stack is of this form."
