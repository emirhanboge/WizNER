    "text": "The Grande Casse (3,855 m) is the highest &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vanoise%20Massif\"&gt;Vanoise Massif&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Graian%20Alps\"&gt;Graian Alps&lt;/a&gt; in the region of &lt;a href=\"Savoie\"&gt;Savoie&lt;/a&gt;, France. It is located in the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Vanoise%20National%20Park\"&gt;Vanoise National Park&lt;/a&gt;, near the village of &lt;a href=\"Pralognan-la-Vanoise\"&gt;Pralognan-la-Vanoise&lt;/a&gt;, which is about 25\u00a0km southeast of the nearest town, &lt;a href=\"Mo%C3%BBtiers\"&gt;Mo\u00fbtiers&lt;/a&gt;. It has a steep 600 m high north face. The other sides of the mountain are more gentle, mostly consisting of broken rocks. A high ridge connects it to the nearby peak of &lt;a href=\"Grande%20Motte\"&gt;Grande Motte&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ridge connecting the Grande Casse and the Grande Motte is the &lt;a href=\"Drainage%20divide\"&gt;watershed&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Tarentaise%20Valley\"&gt;Tarentaise Valley&lt;/a&gt; in the north and &lt;a href=\"Maurienne\"&gt;Maurienne&lt;/a&gt; valley to the south.\nClimbing.\nDespite its height it has a relatively easy &lt;a href=\"normal%20route\"&gt;normal route&lt;/a&gt; to the summit. Climbers usually start from the \"Les Grands Couloirs\" glacier and ascend the southwest side of the mountain. The north face is an &lt;a href=\"extreme%20skiing\"&gt;extreme skiing&lt;/a&gt; destination.\nThe &lt;a href=\"first%20ascent\"&gt;first ascent&lt;/a&gt; was made by &lt;a href=\"William%20Mathews%20%28mountaineer%29\"&gt;William Mathews&lt;/a&gt; along with guides &lt;a href=\"Michel%20Croz\"&gt;Michel Croz&lt;/a&gt; and E. Favre via the southwest face on 8 August 1860. The north face was climbed on 6 August 1933 by the Italians Aldo Bonacossa and L. Binaghi.\nThe Refuge F\u00e9lix Faure (2,516 m), used for the normal route, is located at the &lt;a href=\"Col%20de%20la%20Vanoise\"&gt;Col de la Vanoise&lt;/a&gt;.\nMain routes to the summit.\nThis is an overview of the most common routes to the summit:"
