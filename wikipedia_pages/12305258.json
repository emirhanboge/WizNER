In 2007, he acquired Japanese citizenship automatically as a result of his father's naturalization. Escudero is a cousin of &lt;a href=\"Dami%C3%A1n%20Escudero\"&gt;Dami\u00e1n Escudero&lt;/a&gt; and nephew of &lt;a href=\"Osvaldo%20Escudero\"&gt;Osvaldo Escudero&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nWhen Escudero was three years old, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; because of his father's work and joined the local club team. After living in Japan for five years, he moved to &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and Escudero began his career with the &lt;a href=\"Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20V%C3%A9lez%20S%C3%A1rsfield\"&gt;V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield&lt;/a&gt; youth team, where his father, also named &lt;a href=\"Sergio%20Escudero%20%28footballer%20born%201964%29\"&gt;Sergio Ariel Escudero&lt;/a&gt; and uncle &lt;a href=\"Osvaldo%20Salvador%20Escudero\"&gt;Osvaldo Salvador Escudero&lt;/a&gt; have played.

In May 2008, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20national%20under-23%20football%20team\"&gt;U-23 national team&lt;/a&gt; which played at the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Toulon%20Tournament\"&gt;2008 Toulon Tournament&lt;/a&gt; and scored a goal against &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Coast%20national%20under-23%20football%20team\"&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 17, 2012, Escudero joined South Korean outfit &lt;a href=\"FC%20Seoul\"&gt;FC Seoul&lt;/a&gt; on a six-month loan deal.
