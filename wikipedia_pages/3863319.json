    "text": "The periods of Restoration and Regeneration in &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20history\"&gt;Swiss history&lt;/a&gt; lasted from 1814 to 1847. \"Restoration\" is the period of 1814 to 1830, the restoration of the \"&lt;a href=\"Ancien%20R%C3%A9gime%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;Ancien R\u00e9gime&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"federalism\"&gt;federalism&lt;/a&gt;), reverting the changes imposed by &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"centralism\"&gt;centralist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Helvetic%20Republic\"&gt;Helvetic Republic&lt;/a&gt; from 1798 and the partial reversion to the old system with the &lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20Mediation\"&gt;Act of Mediation&lt;/a&gt; of 1803. \"Regeneration\" is the period of 1830 to 1848, when in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"July%20Revolution\"&gt;July Revolution&lt;/a&gt; the \"restored\" \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" was countered by the &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; movement. In the Protestant cantons, the rural population enforced liberal cantonal constitutions, partly in armed marches on the cities. This resulted in a conservative backlash in the Catholic cantons in the 1830s, raising the conflict to the point of &lt;a href=\"Sonderbund%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; by 1847.\nRestoration.\nWhen Napoleon's fall appeared imminent, the Act of Mediation was suspended in late December 1813, and lengthy discussions about future constitutions were initiated in all &lt;a href=\"cantons%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;cantons of Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tagsatzung\"&gt;Tagsatzung&lt;/a&gt; (the gathering of delegates from all the nineteen cantons) which took place between 6 April 1814 and 31 August 1815, the so-called \"Long Diet\", met at &lt;a href=\"Zurich\"&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt; to replace the constitution. The Diet remained dead-locked until 12 September when Valais, Neuchatel and Geneva were raised to full members of the Confederation. This increased the number of &lt;a href=\"Cantons%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;cantons&lt;/a&gt; to 22. The Diet, however, made little progress until the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; (18 September 1814 to 9 June 1815), Switzerland was represented by a delegation of three conservative politicians, &lt;a href=\"Hans%20von%20Reinhard\"&gt;Hans von Reinhard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Heinrich%20Wieland\"&gt;Johann Heinrich Wieland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johann%20von%20Montenach\"&gt;Johann von Montenach&lt;/a&gt;, besides a number of unofficial lobbyists attempting to influence the country's re-organisation, such as &lt;a href=\"Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric-C%C3%A9sar%20de%20La%20Harpe\"&gt;Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-C\u00e9sar de La Harpe&lt;/a&gt; who, with the support of his former pupil &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20of%20All%20Russia\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Alexander I of Russia&lt;/a&gt;, campaigned for &lt;a href=\"Vaud\"&gt;Vaud&lt;/a&gt;'s independence from &lt;a href=\"Bern\"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 though, on the other hand, de La Harpe opposed the creation of a federal state as opposed to a united Swiss republic. In addition, de La Harpe and his friend Henri Monod lobbied Emperor Alexander, who in turn persuaded the other Allied powers opposing Napoleon to recognise Vaudois and Argovian independence, in spite of Bern's attempts to reclaim them as \"subject lands\".\nThe official delegation had the mission of ensuring the recognition of Swiss neutrality, but their efforts were hampered by a complicated web of cantonal rivalries and diverging agendas, which went to discourage the interest of the great European powers in Swiss affairs. On 20 March, the Congress finalized a declaration on the future status of Switzerland, including the recognition of the territory of the 19 cantons of the Act of Mediation (including financial compensation for those cantons which had lost territory to newly formed ones) and the recognition of &lt;a href=\"Valais\"&gt;Valais&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neuch%C3%A2tel\"&gt;Neuch\u00e2tel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"canton%20of%20Geneva\"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; as part of Switzerland, while the &lt;a href=\"Valtellina\"&gt;Valtellina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chiavenna\"&gt;Chiavenna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bormio\"&gt;Bormio&lt;/a&gt; were detached from the &lt;a href=\"Grisons\"&gt;Grisons&lt;/a&gt; and made part of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lombardy-Venetia\"&gt;Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecognition of Swiss neutrality was left undecided, and on 20 May, after &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Days\"&gt;Napoleon's return from Elba&lt;/a&gt; the Swiss Tagsatzung gave in to allied pressure and declared war on France, allowing the passage of allied troops across Swiss territory (see the &lt;a href=\"minor%20campaigns%20of%201815\"&gt;minor campaigns of 1815&lt;/a&gt;). Swiss troops under General &lt;a href=\"Niklaus%20Franz%20von%20Bachmann\"&gt;Niklaus Franz von Bachmann&lt;/a&gt; advanced to the &lt;a href=\"Franche-Comt%C3%A9\"&gt;Franche-Comt\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; without orders from the diet, but were ordered back. The French fort at &lt;a href=\"H%C3%BCningen\"&gt;H\u00fcningen&lt;/a&gt; near Basel was placed under siege by Austrian and Swiss troops and surrendered on 28 August. The Swiss were particularly eager to lay siege to this fortress after its commander General &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Barban%C3%A8gre\"&gt;Joseph Barban\u00e8gre&lt;/a&gt; opened fire on the city of Basel.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281815%29\"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt; of 20 November included a financial compensation for Switzerland besides the acquisition of a small territorial gain, connecting the canton of Geneva (formerly an &lt;a href=\"exclave\"&gt;exclave&lt;/a&gt;) to Vaud. Most significantly, the Treaty included the recognition of permanent Swiss neutrality by all European powers.\nCantonal constitutions were worked out independently from 1814, in general restoring the late feudal conditions of the 17th and 18th century. The &lt;a href=\"Tagsatzung\"&gt;Tagsatzung&lt;/a&gt; was re-organized by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Treaty\"&gt;Federal Treaty&lt;/a&gt; (\"Bundesvertrag\") of 7 August 1815.\nThe Tagsatzung reintroduced the &lt;a href=\"Flag%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;old flag&lt;/a&gt; consisting of a white cross on a red field, using it for the &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;seal and coat of arms&lt;/a&gt; of the confederation.\nEnd of the Restoration.\nFollowing the French &lt;a href=\"July%20Revolution\"&gt;July Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in 1830, a number of large assemblies were held calling for new cantonal constitutions. As each canton had its own constitution, the assemblies in each canton addressed different specifics, but they all had two main issues. First, they called for peacefully adjusting the constitutions by adjusting the way seats in local &lt;a href=\"legislature\"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Tagsatzung\"&gt;Tagsatzung&lt;/a&gt; were allocated. In particular they objected to what they saw as the over-representation of the cantonal capital in the government. Secondly, they sought a way to amend the constitution. Very few cantons even had a way to amend or modify the constitutions, and none of them allowed citizen's &lt;a href=\"initiative\"&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt;s to be added.\nThe first assembly was held near &lt;a href=\"Weinfelden\"&gt;Weinfelden&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thurgau\"&gt;Thurgau&lt;/a&gt; in October and November 1830. Followed in November by meetings in &lt;a href=\"Wohlenschwil\"&gt;Wohlenschwil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aargau\"&gt;Aargau&lt;/a&gt; then &lt;a href=\"Sursee\"&gt;Sursee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Lucerne\"&gt;Lucerne&lt;/a&gt; and finally the &lt;a href=\"Ustertag\"&gt;Ustertag&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Uster\"&gt;Uster&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Zurich\"&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;. In December there were three assemblies in the &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20St.%20Gallen\"&gt;Canton of St. Gallen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wattwil\"&gt;Wattwil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Altst%C3%A4tten\"&gt;Altst\u00e4tten&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St.%20Gallenkappel\"&gt;St. Gallenkappel&lt;/a&gt; as well as in &lt;a href=\"Balsthal\"&gt;Balsthal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Solothurn\"&gt;Solothurn&lt;/a&gt;. The final assembly was held in &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCnsingen\"&gt;M\u00fcnsingen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Bern\"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt; in January 1831.\nThe speeches and articles reporting on the assemblies were widely distributed and became very popular. The crowds were generally well behaved and orderly. For example, in &lt;a href=\"Wohlenschwil\"&gt;Wohlenschwil&lt;/a&gt; it was reported that they met \"in unexpectedly quiet attitude with decency and perfect order\". Even in &lt;a href=\"Aargau\"&gt;Aargau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20St.%20Gallen\"&gt;St. Gallen&lt;/a&gt;, where the crowd marched through the streets of &lt;a href=\"Aarau\"&gt;Aarau&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"Frei%C3%A4mtersturm\"&gt;Frei\u00e4mtersturm&lt;/a&gt;\") and &lt;a href=\"St.%20Gallen\"&gt;St. Gallen&lt;/a&gt;, the protest march was peaceful. Following the assemblies and marches, cantonal governments quickly gave into the demands of the assemblies and amended their constitutions.\nRegeneration.\nThis \"restored\" state of affairs meant that the &lt;a href=\"Patrician%20%28post-Roman%20Europe%29\"&gt;Patriciate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"free%20city%20%28antiquity%29\"&gt;free cities&lt;/a&gt; regained much of their former power, to the disadvantage of the rural population, resulting in rebellions and violent conflicts such as the &lt;a href=\"Z%C3%BCriputsch\"&gt;Z\u00fcriputsch&lt;/a&gt; of 1839. Some Republican achievements were preserved, however, such as the abolition of the subject territories, preserving the &lt;a href=\"Aargau\"&gt;Aargau&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thurgau\"&gt;Thurgau&lt;/a&gt; as independent cantons, and the guarantee of equal political rights of all (male) citizens of a canton. In Basel, the conflict resulted in the split of &lt;a href=\"Basel-City\"&gt;Basel-City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Basel-Country\"&gt;Basel-Country&lt;/a&gt; in 1833. Similarly, a canton \"Ausserschwyz\" temporarily seceded from the &lt;a href=\"canton%20of%20Schwyz\"&gt;canton of Schwyz&lt;/a&gt; in 1831, but was re-united with Schwyz in 1833 after the drawing up of an egalitarian constitution. Since 1830 the democratic forces had been in the ascent. The &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20and%20radicalism%20in%20Switzerland\"&gt;Radical Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; of Switzerland embodied these democratic forces. \nDemands for a new federal constitution with a tighter relationship between the various cantons and rights for the individual citizens arose from the Radical Party of Switzerland and from liberal groups like the group that called itself \"la jeune Suisse\" (&lt;a href=\"Young%20Switzerland\"&gt;Young Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;). Indeed, the Radical Party had formed the group called Young Switzerland in the first place with the intent of arousing liberal support for these ideas in all cantons of Switzerland. \nThe central demands of the liberal groups like Young Switzerland, were for abolition of &lt;a href=\"censorship\"&gt;censorship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"separation%20of%20church%20and%20state\"&gt;separation of church and state&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"popular%20sovereignty\"&gt;popular sovereignty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"representative%20democracy\"&gt;representative democracy&lt;/a&gt;. Also included were demands for a uniform system of coinage. These reforms, especially the economic reforms would strengthen trade, industry and banking within Switzerland. However, the monetary reforms were the reforms that were opposed the strongest. The opposition to these economic demands became cloaked in religious rhetoric. Members of the Radical Party and of Young Switzerland were attacked by the Jesuits as being infidels. In this political conflict, the right-wing &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; representing the Patriciate was pitted against the \"&lt;a href=\"free%20thinking\"&gt;free thinking&lt;/a&gt;\" left-wing \"Radical Party\", the predecessor of the contemporary &lt;a href=\"Free%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Switzerland\"&gt;Free Democratic Party of Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. When the Radicals rose to power during the 1830s, they imposed restrictions against the Catholic Church in the &lt;a href=\"Aargau\"&gt;Aargau&lt;/a&gt; in 1841. &lt;a href=\"Lucerne\"&gt;Lucerne&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation re-admitted the &lt;a href=\"Jesuits\"&gt;Jesuits&lt;/a&gt; as teachers at cantonal schools. Provoked by this (the \"&lt;a href=\"Religion%20in%20Switzerland%23Jesuit%20question\"&gt;Jesuit question&lt;/a&gt;\") armed radicals invaded the canton, the \"&lt;a href=\"Freischar\"&gt;Freischar&lt;/a&gt;enz\u00fcge\" of 1844 and 1845, led by &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Snell\"&gt;Wilhelm Snell&lt;/a&gt;, the later Federal Councillors &lt;a href=\"Ulrich%20Ochsenbein\"&gt;Ulrich Ochsenbein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jakob%20St%C3%A4mpfli\"&gt;Jakob St\u00e4mpfli&lt;/a&gt;. Also participating was &lt;a href=\"Gottfried%20Keller\"&gt;Gottfried Keller&lt;/a&gt;, but he never participated in combat. The invasion of 1845 ended in a disaster for the \"Freisch\u00e4rler\", 35 of their number being killed. The Radical side again reverted to political means, and the Jesuits were again expelled by decree of the federal &lt;a href=\"Tagsatzung\"&gt;Tagsatzung&lt;/a&gt; on 3 September 1847 (a decree only repealed in 1973).\nThe Catholic &lt;a href=\"Sonderbund\"&gt;Sonderbund&lt;/a&gt; of 1845 was a reaction to the \"Freischarenz\u00fcge\". Due to its violation of inter-cantonal treaties, the confederate army was raised. The confederate forces invaded Sonderbund territory in November 1847, initiating the &lt;a href=\"Sonderbund%20War\"&gt;Sonderbund War&lt;/a&gt;, which thanks to the thoughtful campaign by General &lt;a href=\"Guillaume-Henri%20Dufour\"&gt;Guillaume-Henri Dufour&lt;/a&gt; resulted in fewer than a hundred casualties on both sides.\nAfter the hostilities ceased, the Catholic side having the disadvantage, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland%20as%20a%20federal%20state\"&gt;Modern Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; was formed by the first &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20Federal%20Constitution\"&gt;Federal Constitution&lt;/a&gt;."
