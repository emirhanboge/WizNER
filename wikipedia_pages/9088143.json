    "text": "The is a &lt;a href=\"home%20video%20game%20console\"&gt;home video game console&lt;/a&gt; that was produced by &lt;a href=\"Sharp%20Corporation\"&gt;Sharp Corporation&lt;/a&gt; in 1986 and was only released in Japan. It is a licensed &lt;a href=\"Nintendo\"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; product that combines the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System\"&gt;Family Computer&lt;/a&gt; (Famicom) and the &lt;a href=\"Family%20Computer%20Disk%20System\"&gt;Family Computer Disk System&lt;/a&gt; (FDS) into a single piece of hardware. Sharp removed most Nintendo branding from the system, even going as far as to remove the \"Nintendo\" branding from the Famicom Disk System startup, replacing it with the same \"FAMICOM\" logo used on the system itself.\nOverview.\nThe basic parts of the Twin Famicom include a slot for Famicom cartridges, a slot for the Disk System's Disk Cards, a switch located right below the cartridge slot to switch between the two formats, a power button, a reset button, and an eject button. The back of the console has slots for controller storage.\nThe system does not allow both slots to be used at the same time. The switch that changes the mode from disk to cartridge works in a manner in which choosing to use the cartridge slot will block the disk drive, and vice versa. However, in some systems, only the cartridge slot will be blocked, but it is impossible to change to cartridge mode while the disk is being read.\nFeatures.\nLike all other Famicom consoles, the Twin Famicom has an &lt;a href=\"expansion%20port\"&gt;expansion port&lt;/a&gt; that allows additional peripherals to be connected to the console, such as the &lt;a href=\"NES%20Zapper\"&gt;beam gun&lt;/a&gt; or another controller; it is located on the right side of the console and labeled . The console also features three additional expansion ports; port \"B\" is located next to port \"A\", while ports \"C\" and \"D\" are located on the bottom rear, hidden by a removable cover. However, unlike port \"A\", no known existing peripherals use them.\nWhereas the standard Famicom only has one color combination, the Twin Famicom was initially sold in two colors: red with black highlights (AN-500R), and black with red highlights (AN-500B). A second version of the system was released in 1987 with a slightly different case design, turbo controllers, and two different color schemes; black with green highlights (AN-505-BK) and red with beige highlights (AN-505-RD).\nThe Twin Famicom generates an &lt;a href=\"NTSC\"&gt;NTSC&lt;/a&gt; signal, but outputs &lt;a href=\"composite%20video\"&gt;composite video&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"monophonic%20audio\"&gt;monophonic audio&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"RCA%20connector\"&gt;RCA connector&lt;/a&gt;s instead of using an &lt;a href=\"RF%20modulator\"&gt;RF modulator&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for greater audiovisual quality on TVs and monitors with such inputs; such connections were quite rare in Japan when it was released. An external RF modulator is bundled with the unit for connection through a TV's antenna/cable input. The two gamepads are hardwired into the console, so they can not be disconnected."
