    "text": "AT&amp;T Inc. (originally the American Telephone and Telegraph Company) is an American &lt;a href=\"multinational%20corporation\"&gt;multinational&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"conglomerate%20%28company%29\"&gt;conglomerate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"holding%20company\"&gt;holding company&lt;/a&gt; that is &lt;a href=\"Delaware%20General%20Corporation%20Law\"&gt;Delaware-registered&lt;/a&gt; but headquartered at &lt;a href=\"Whitacre%20Tower\"&gt;Whitacre Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Dallas\"&gt;Downtown Dallas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. It is the world's largest telecommunications company and the largest provider of mobile telephone services in the U.S. , AT&amp;T was ranked 9th on the &lt;a href=\"Fortune%20500\"&gt;\"Fortune\" 500&lt;/a&gt; rankings of the largest United States corporations, with revenues of $181 billion.\nDuring most of the 20th century, AT&amp;T had a monopoly on phone service in the United States. The company began its history as the American District Telegraph Company, formed in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; in 1878. After expanding services to &lt;a href=\"Arkansas\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kansas\"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, through a series of mergers, it became Southwestern Bell Telephone Company in 1920, which was then a subsidiary of American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The latter was a successor of the original &lt;a href=\"Bell%20Telephone%20Company\"&gt;Bell Telephone Company&lt;/a&gt; founded by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Graham%20Bell\"&gt;Alexander Graham Bell&lt;/a&gt; in 1877. The American Bell Telephone Company formed the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) subsidiary in 1885. In 1899, AT&amp;T became the parent company after the American Bell Telephone Company sold its assets to its subsidiary. The company was rebranded as &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20Corporation\"&gt;AT&amp;T Corp.&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. The 1982 &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20v.%20AT%26amp%3BT\"&gt;United States v. AT&amp;T&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"antitrust\"&gt;antitrust&lt;/a&gt; lawsuit resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Breakup%20of%20the%20Bell%20System\"&gt;divestiture&lt;/a&gt; of AT&amp;T's (\"Ma Bell\") local operating subsidiaries which were grouped into seven &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Bell%20Operating%20Company\"&gt;Regional Bell Operating Companies&lt;/a&gt; (RBOCs), commonly referred to as \"Baby Bells\", resulting in seven independent companies, including Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC). The latter changed its name to SBC Communications Inc. in 1995. \nIn 2005, SBC purchased its former parent AT&amp;T Corp. and took on its branding, with the merged entity naming itself AT&amp;T Inc. and using its history, a version of its iconic logo and stock-trading symbol which launched on December 30, 2005. AT&amp;T Inc. acquired &lt;a href=\"BellSouth\"&gt;BellSouth Corporation&lt;/a&gt; in 2006, the last independent Baby Bell company, making its formerly joint venture &lt;a href=\"Cingular\"&gt;Cingular Wireless&lt;/a&gt; (which had acquired AT&amp;T Wireless in 2004) wholly owned and rebranding it as &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20Mobility\"&gt;AT&amp;T Mobility&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;T Inc. also acquired &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warner\"&gt;Time Warner&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, with the proposed merger confirming on June 12, 2018 and the aim of making AT&amp;T the largest and controlling shareholder of Time Warner and rebranding it as WarnerMedia in 2018.\nThe current AT&amp;T &lt;a href=\"Breakup%20of%20the%20Bell%20System%23Evolution%20of%20the%20Baby%20Bells\"&gt;reconstitutes much of the former Bell System&lt;/a&gt;, and includes four of the seven \"Baby Bells\" along with the original AT&amp;T Corp., including the &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20Communications\"&gt;long-distance division&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigin and growth (1885\u20131981).\nAT&amp;T was founded as Bell Telephone Company by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Graham%20Bell\"&gt;Alexander Graham Bell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20A.%20Watson\"&gt;Thomas Watson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gardiner%20Greene%20Hubbard\"&gt;Gardiner Greene Hubbard&lt;/a&gt; after Bell's patenting of the telephone in 1875. By 1881, Bell Telephone Company had become the American Bell Telephone Company. One of its subsidiaries was the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T), established in 1885. On December 30, 1899, AT&amp;T acquired the assets of its parent American Bell Telephone, becoming the new parent company. AT&amp;T established a network of local telephone subsidiaries in the United States. AT&amp;T and its subsidiaries held a phone service &lt;a href=\"monopoly\"&gt;monopoly&lt;/a&gt;, authorized in 1913 by government authorities with the &lt;a href=\"Kingsbury%20Commitment\"&gt;Kingsbury Commitment&lt;/a&gt;, throughout most of the twentieth century. This monopoly was known as the &lt;a href=\"Bell%20System\"&gt;Bell System&lt;/a&gt;, and during this period, AT&amp;T was also known by the nickname Ma Bell.\nBreakup and reformation (1982\u20132004).\nIn 1982, U.S. &lt;a href=\"Breakup%20of%20the%20Bell%20System\"&gt;regulators broke up the AT&amp;T monopoly&lt;/a&gt;, requiring AT&amp;T to divest its local subsidiaries, which it did by grouping them into seven individual companies. These new companies were known as Regional Bell Operating Companies, or more informally, Baby Bells. AT&amp;T continued to operate long-distance services but faced increasing competition from overseas supplied competitors such as &lt;a href=\"MCI%20Communications\"&gt;MCI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sprint%20Corporation\"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt;.\nSouthwestern Bell Corporation (SBC) was one of the companies created by the breakup of AT&amp;T Corp. The company soon started a series of acquisitions, including the 1987 acquisition of &lt;a href=\"Metromedia\"&gt;Metromedia&lt;/a&gt; mobile business and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the latter half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including two Baby Bells (&lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Telesis\"&gt;Pacific Telesis Group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ameritech\"&gt;Ameritech Corporation&lt;/a&gt;), while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications Inc. In early 1997 &lt;a href=\"C.%20Michael%20Armstrong\"&gt;C. Michael Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; was named CEO, and Armstrong appointed &lt;a href=\"John%20Zeglis\"&gt;John Zeglis&lt;/a&gt; as President later in that same year. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the Fortune 500, and by 1999, when Zeglis assumed the positions of chairman and CEO of &lt;a href=\"At%26amp%3Bt%20wireless\"&gt;AT&amp;T Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;T was part of the &lt;a href=\"Dow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average\"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; (lasting through 2015). Zeglis ended his service as president of AT&amp;T in 2001 and resigned from his positions in AT&amp;T Wireless in 2004.\nPurchase of former parent and acquisitions (2005\u20132014).\nOn November 18, 2005, SBC Communications, Inc.based in San Antonio, purchased AT&amp;T Corp. for $16 billion. After this purchase, SBC adopted the better-known AT&amp;T name and brand, with the original AT&amp;T Corp. still existing as the long-distance landline subsidiary of the merged company. The current AT&amp;T Inc. claims the original AT&amp;T Corp.\u2019s history (dating to 1877) as its own, but retains SBC's pre-2005 corporate structure and stock price history. As well, all SEC filings before 2005 are under SBC, not AT&amp;T.\nAT&amp;T made to purchase &lt;a href=\"T-Mobile\"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; for a $39 billion stock and cash offer. The bid was withdrawn after the takeover company was faced with significant regulatory and legal hurdles, along with heavy resistance from the U.S. government. As per the original acquisition agreement, T-Mobile received $3 billion in cash as well as access to $1 billion worth of AT&amp;T-held wireless spectrum.\nIn September 2013, AT&amp;T announced it would expand into &lt;a href=\"Latin%20America\"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; through a collaboration with &lt;a href=\"Am%C3%A9rica%20M%C3%B3vil\"&gt;Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil&lt;/a&gt;. In December 2013, AT&amp;T announced plans to sell its Connecticut wireline operations to Stamford-based &lt;a href=\"Frontier%20Communications\"&gt;Frontier Communications&lt;/a&gt;.\nAT&amp;T acquired &lt;a href=\"BellSouth\"&gt;BellSouth Corporation&lt;/a&gt; on December 29, 2006 following &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Communications%20Commission\"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; approval. The transaction consolidated ownership and management of Cingular Wireless. AT&amp;T rebranded its wireless retail stores from Cingular to AT&amp;T in January 2007.\nRecent developments (2014\u2013present).\nIn late 2014, AT&amp;T purchased Mexican cellular carrier &lt;a href=\"Iusacell\"&gt;Iusacell&lt;/a&gt;, and two months later, it purchased the Mexican wireless business of &lt;a href=\"NII%20Holdings\"&gt;NII Holdings&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;T merged the two companies to create &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20Mexico\"&gt;AT&amp;T Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn July 2015, AT&amp;T purchased &lt;a href=\"DirecTV\"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt; for $48.5 billion. AT&amp;T then announced plans to converge its existing U-verse home internet and IPTV brands with &lt;a href=\"DirecTV\"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt;, to create &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20Entertainment\"&gt;AT&amp;T Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn October 22, 2016, AT&amp;T announced a deal to buy &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warner\"&gt;Time Warner&lt;/a&gt; for $108.7 billion in an effort to increase its media holdings. On November 20, 2017, Assistant Attorney General &lt;a href=\"Makan%20Delrahim\"&gt;Makan Delrahim&lt;/a&gt; filed a lawsuit for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice%20Antitrust%20Division\"&gt;United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division&lt;/a&gt; to block the merger with Time Warner, saying it \"will harm competition, result in higher bills for consumers and less innovation.\" On June 12, 2018, U.S. District Court Judge &lt;a href=\"Richard%20J.%20Leon\"&gt;Richard J. Leon&lt;/a&gt; ruled that the merger could go forward. The merger closed two days after, and Time Warner becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T with a new name, WarnerMedia, announced the next day. Among other key assets, the acquisition of &lt;a href=\"WarnerMedia\"&gt;WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt; by AT&amp;T included the &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.%20Pictures\"&gt;Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/a&gt; film and television studios, U.S. cable/satellite channels such as &lt;a href=\"HBO\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adult%20Swim\"&gt;Adult Swim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boomerang%20%28TV%20network%29\"&gt;Boomerang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cartoon%20Network\"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"CNN\"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TBS%20%28American%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;TBS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TNT%20%28American%20TV%20network%29\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"TruTV\"&gt;TruTV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turner%20Classic%20Movies\"&gt;Turner Classic Movies&lt;/a&gt; and a 50% stake in &lt;a href=\"The%20CW\"&gt;The CW&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"ViacomCBS\"&gt;ViacomCBS&lt;/a&gt; owns the other 50%).\nThree months after completing the acquisition, AT&amp;T reorganized into four main units: Communications, including consumer and business wireline telephony, AT&amp;T Mobility, and consumer entertainment video services; WarnerMedia, including Turner cable television networks, &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.\"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt; film and television production, and &lt;a href=\"HBO\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt;; AT&amp;T Latin America, consisting of wireless service in Mexico and video in Latin America and the Caribbean under the &lt;a href=\"Vrio%20Corp.\"&gt;Vrio&lt;/a&gt; brand; and Advertising and Analytics, since renamed &lt;a href=\"Xandr\"&gt;Xandr&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 13, 2017, it was reported that AT&amp;T would introduce a &lt;a href=\"cloud%20computing\"&gt;cloud-based&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Digital%20video%20recorder\"&gt;DVR&lt;/a&gt; streaming service as part of its effort to create a unified platform across DirecTV and its &lt;a href=\"DirecTV%20Now\"&gt;DirecTV Now&lt;/a&gt; streaming service, with &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20U-verse\"&gt;U-verse&lt;/a&gt; to be added soon. The service, named &lt;a href=\"HBO%20Max\"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, launched in May 2020.\nOn September 12, 2017, it was reported that AT&amp;T planned to launch a new cable TV-like service for delivery over-the-top over its own or a competitor's broadband network sometime the following year.\nOn March 7, 2018, the company prepared to sell a minority stake of DirecTV Latin America through an &lt;a href=\"Initial%20public%20offering\"&gt;IPO&lt;/a&gt;, creating a new holding company for those assets named Vrio Corp. However, on April 18, just a day before the public debut of Vrio, AT&amp;T canceled the IPO due to market conditions.\n, AT&amp;T is the world's largest telecommunications company. AT&amp;T is also the largest provider of mobile telephone services and the largest provider of &lt;a href=\"telephone\"&gt;fixed telephone&lt;/a&gt; services in the United States.\nIn September 2019, &lt;a href=\"activist%20investor\"&gt;activist investor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elliott%20Management%20Corporation\"&gt;Elliott Management&lt;/a&gt; revealed that it had purchased $3.2 billion of AT&amp;T stock (a 1.2% equity interest), and had pushed for the company to divest assets to improve its share value.\nOn March 4, 2020, AT&amp;T announced its intent to perform major cost-cutting moves, including cuts to capital investment, and plans to promote &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20TV\"&gt;AT&amp;T TV&lt;/a&gt; (which officially launched nationally on March 2) as its primary pay television service offering. AT&amp;T stated it would still primarily promote DirecTV \"where cable broadband is not prevalent\", and as a specialty option.\nOn April 24, 2020, AT&amp;T announced that effective July 1, 2020, company COO &lt;a href=\"John%20Stankey\"&gt;John Stankey&lt;/a&gt; would replace &lt;a href=\"Randall%20L.%20Stephenson\"&gt;Randall L. Stephenson&lt;/a&gt; as CEO of AT&amp;T. It was also acknowledged that AT&amp;T's acquisitions of DirecTV and Time Warner had by this point resulted in a massive debt burden of $200 billion for the company.\nAs a result of planned cost cutting programs, the sale of &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Bros.%20Interactive%20Entertainment\"&gt;Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xandr\"&gt;Xandr&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"DirecTV\"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20U-verse\"&gt;AT&amp;T U-verse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"DirecTV%20Stream\"&gt;AT&amp;T TV&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Crunchyroll\"&gt;Crunchyroll&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=\"Rooster%20Teeth\"&gt;Rooster Teeth&lt;/a&gt; were proposed. The planned sale of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment was abandoned after COVID-19 related growth in the Gaming industry, as well as a positive reception to upcoming &lt;a href=\"DC%20Comics\"&gt;DC Comics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lego\"&gt;Lego&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Star%20Wars\"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt;,\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Harry%20Potter\"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;\" titles from fans and critics. The other subsidiaries are still receiving bids as of September 1, 2020.\nIn May 2021, AT&amp;T announced plans to spin off &lt;a href=\"WarnerMedia\"&gt;WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt;, which will merge with &lt;a href=\"Discovery%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Discovery, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; for $43 billion.\nOn December 21, 2021, AT&amp;T announced that they had agreed to sell Xandr (and AppNexus) to &lt;a href=\"Microsoft\"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; for an undisclosed price, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews.\nLandline operating companies.\nOf the eight companies that were part of the Breakup of the Bell System, these five are a part of the current AT&amp;T:\nFormer operating companies.\nThe following companies have become defunct or were sold under SBC/AT&amp;T ownership:\nDecline of rural landlines.\nOf the &lt;a href=\"Baby%20Bell\"&gt;Baby Bell&lt;/a&gt;s, Ameritech sold some of its &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; landlines to &lt;a href=\"CenturyTel\"&gt;CenturyTel&lt;/a&gt;, in 1998; BellSouth sold some of its lines to MebTel, during the 2000s; &lt;a href=\"US%20West\"&gt;U S WEST&lt;/a&gt; sold many historically Bell landlines to Lynch Communications and &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Telecom\"&gt;Pacific Telecom&lt;/a&gt;, in the 1990s; &lt;a href=\"Verizon\"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; sold many of its &lt;a href=\"Verizon%20New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; lines to &lt;a href=\"FairPoint%20Communications\"&gt;FairPoint&lt;/a&gt;, in 2008, and its &lt;a href=\"Frontier%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; operations to Frontier Communications, in 2010.\nOn October 25, 2014, Frontier Communications took over control of the AT&amp;T landline network in Connecticut after being approved by state utility regulators. The deal was worth about $2 billion, and included Frontier inheriting about 2,500 of AT&amp;T's employees and many of AT&amp;T's buildings.\nCorporate structure.\nFacilities and regions.\nThe company is headquartered at Whitacre Tower in &lt;a href=\"downtown\"&gt;downtown&lt;/a&gt; Dallas, Texas. On June 27, 2008, AT&amp;T announced that it would move its corporate headquarters from downtown San Antonio to &lt;a href=\"One%20AT%26amp%3BT%20Plaza\"&gt;One AT&amp;T Plaza&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Dallas. The company said that it moved to gain better access to its customers and operations throughout the world, and to the key technology partners, suppliers, innovation and human resources needed as it continues to grow, domestically and internationally. AT&amp;T Inc. previously relocated its corporate headquarters to San Antonio from St. Louis, Missouri, in 1992, when it was then named Southwestern Bell Corporation. The company's Telecom Operations group, which serves residential and regional business customers in 22 U.S. states, remains in San Antonio. Atlanta, Georgia, continues to be the headquarters for AT&amp;T Mobility, with significant offices in Redmond, Washington, the former home of &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20Wireless%20Services\"&gt;AT&amp;T Wireless&lt;/a&gt;. Bedminster, New Jersey, is the headquarters for the company's Global Business Services group and AT&amp;T Labs and is where the original AT&amp;T Corp. remains located. St. Louis continues as home to the company's Directory operations, &lt;a href=\"AT%26amp%3BT%20Advertising%20Solutions\"&gt;AT&amp;T Advertising Solutions&lt;/a&gt;.\nAT&amp;T also offers services in many locations throughout the &lt;a href=\"Asia-Pacific\"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;; its regional headquarters is located in Hong Kong. The company is also active in Mexico, and on November 7, 2014, it was announced that Mexican carrier Iusacell would be acquired by AT&amp;T. The acquisition was approved in January 2015. On April 30, 2015, AT&amp;T acquired wireless operations Nextel Mexico from NII Holdings (now AT&amp;T Mexico).\nCorporate governance.\nAT&amp;T's current &lt;a href=\"board%20of%20directors\"&gt;board of directors&lt;/a&gt; :\nThe current management includes:\nPolitical involvement.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Center%20for%20Responsive%20Politics\"&gt;Center for Responsive Politics&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;T was the fourteenth-largest donor to United States federal political campaigns and committees from 1989 to 2019, having contributed more than , 58% of which went to &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; and 42% of which went to &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;. As an example, in 2005, AT&amp;T was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. Bill Leahy, representing AT&amp;T, sits on the Private Enterprise Board of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Legislative%20Exchange%20Council\"&gt;American Legislative Exchange Council&lt;/a&gt; (ALEC). ALEC is a &lt;a href=\"nonprofit%20organization\"&gt;nonprofit organization&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"state%20legislature%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;state legislators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"private%20sector\"&gt;private sector&lt;/a&gt; representatives that drafts and shares model state-level legislation for distribution among state governments in the United States.\nDuring the period of 1998 to 2019, the company expended on &lt;a href=\"lobbying\"&gt;lobbying&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. A key political issue for AT&amp;T has been the question of which businesses win the right to profit by providing broadband internet access in the United States. The company has also lobbied in support of several federal bills. AT&amp;T supported the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Communications%20Commission%20Process%20Reform%20Act%20of%202013%20%28H.R.%203675%3B%20113th%20Congress%29\"&gt;Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress)&lt;/a&gt;, a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Federal%20Communications%20Commission\"&gt;U.S. Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes. The FCC would have to act in a more transparent way as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations. AT&amp;T's Executive Vice President of Federal Relations, &lt;a href=\"Tim%20McKone\"&gt;Tim McKone&lt;/a&gt;, said that the bill's \"much needed institutional reforms will help arm the agency with the tools to keep pace with the Internet speed of today's marketplace. It will also ensure that outmoded regulatory practices for today's competitive marketplace are properly placed in the dustbin of history.\"\nIn May 2018, reports emerged that AT&amp;T made 12 monthly payments between January and December 2017 to Essential Consultants, a company set up by President &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;'s lawyer &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Cohen%20%28lawyer%29\"&gt;Michael Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, totaling $600,000. Although initial reports on May 8 mentioned only four monthly payments totaling $200,000, documents obtained by the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" on May 10 confirmed the figure of 12 payments, which had begun three days after the President was &lt;a href=\"Inauguration%20of%20Donald%20Trump\"&gt;sworn into office&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;T confirmed the report the same day. The report from \"The Washington Post\", as well as additional reporting from &lt;a href=\"Bloomberg%20News\"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, revealed the payments had been made for Cohen to \"provide guidance\" relating to the attempted $85 billion merger with &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warner\"&gt;Time Warner&lt;/a&gt;, to gain information on the Trump administration's planned tax reforms, as well as about potential changes to &lt;a href=\"Net%20neutrality%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;net neutrality&lt;/a&gt; policies under the new FCC. However, Chairman of the FCC &lt;a href=\"Ajit%20Pai\"&gt;Ajit Pai&lt;/a&gt; denied Cohen ever inquired about net neutrality on AT&amp;T's behalf. A spokesperson for AT&amp;T said that the company had been contacted by &lt;a href=\"Special%20Counsel%20investigation%20%282017%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;the Special Counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller&lt;/a&gt; regarding the payments, and had provided all the information requested in November and December 2017.\nIn early 2019, the Democratic &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary\"&gt;House Judiciary&lt;/a&gt; requested records related to the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger from the &lt;a href=\"White%20House\"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile it has expressed support for &lt;a href=\"LGBTQ\"&gt;LGBTQ&lt;/a&gt; causes, AT&amp;T has also donated to sponsors of anti-transgender legislation in several US states, including Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Texas and Florida.\nHistorical financial performance.\nThe financial performance of the company is reported to shareholders on an annual basis and a matter of public record. Where performance has been restated, the most recent statement of performance from an annual report is used.\nCarbon footprint.\nAT&amp;T reported Total &lt;a href=\"carbon%20footprint\"&gt;CO2e emissions&lt;/a&gt; (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 5,788 Kt (-737 /-11.3% y-o-y) and plans to reduce emissions by 63% by 2030 from a 2015 base year. This &lt;a href=\"Science%20Based%20Targets%20initiative\"&gt;science-based target&lt;/a&gt; is aligned with &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Agreement\"&gt;Paris Agreement&lt;/a&gt; to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\nCriticism and controversies.\nHemisphere database.\nThe company maintains a database of &lt;a href=\"call%20detail%20record\"&gt;call detail record&lt;/a&gt;s of all telephone calls that have passed through its network since 1987. AT&amp;T employees work at &lt;a href=\"High%20Intensity%20Drug%20Trafficking%20Area\"&gt;High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area&lt;/a&gt; offices (operated by the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20National%20Drug%20Control%20Policy\"&gt;Office of National Drug Control Policy&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Houston\"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt; so data can be quickly turned over to law enforcement agencies. Records are requested via an administrative subpoena, without the involvement of a court or grand jury.\nCensorship.\nIn September 2007, AT&amp;T changed its legal policy to state that \"AT&amp;T may immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Service, any Member ID, electronic mail address, IP address, Universal Resource Locator or domain name used by you, without notice for conduct that AT&amp;T believes ... (c) tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&amp;T, or its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries.\" By October 10, 2007, AT&amp;T had altered the terms and conditions for its Internet service to explicitly support freedom of expression by its subscribers, after an outcry claiming the company had given itself the right to censor its subscribers' transmissions.\nPrivacy controversy.\nIn 2006, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lodged the &lt;a href=\"class%20action\"&gt;class action&lt;/a&gt; lawsuit \"Hepting v. AT&amp;T\", which alleged that AT&amp;T had allowed agents of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Security%20Agency\"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (NSA) to monitor phone and Internet communications of AT&amp;T customers without warrants. If true, this would violate the &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act\"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1978 and the &lt;a href=\"First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;Fourth Amendments&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;U.S. Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;T has yet to confirm or deny that monitoring by the NSA is occurring. In April 2006, retired former AT&amp;T technician Mark Klein lodged an &lt;a href=\"affidavit\"&gt;affidavit&lt;/a&gt; supporting this allegation. The Department of Justice stated it would intervene in this lawsuit by means of &lt;a href=\"State%20Secrets%20Privilege\"&gt;State Secrets Privilege&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn July 2006, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California \u2013 in which the suit was filed \u2013 rejected a federal government motion to dismiss the case. The motion to dismiss, which invoked the State Secrets Privilege, had argued that any court review of the alleged partnership between the federal government and AT&amp;T would harm national security. The case was immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit. It was dismissed on June 3, 2009, citing retroactive legislation in the &lt;a href=\"FISA%20Amendments%20Act\"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May 2006, \"&lt;a href=\"USA%20Today\"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that all international and domestic calling records had been handed over to the National Security Agency by AT&amp;T, Verizon, SBC, and BellSouth for the purpose of creating a massive &lt;a href=\"NSA%20call%20database\"&gt;calling database&lt;/a&gt;. The portions of the \"new\" AT&amp;T that had been part of SBC Communications before November 18, 2005, were not mentioned.\nOn June 21, 2006, the \"&lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Chronicle\"&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that AT&amp;T had rewritten rules on its privacy policy. The policy, which took effect June 23, 2006, says that \"AT&amp;T \u2013 not customers \u2013 owns customers' confidential info and can use it 'to protect its legitimate business interests, safeguard others, or respond to legal process.'\"\nOn August 22, 2007, National Intelligence Director &lt;a href=\"John%20Michael%20McConnell\"&gt;Mike McConnell&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that AT&amp;T was one of the telecommunications companies that assisted with the government's warrantless wire-tapping program on calls between foreign and domestic sources.\nOn November 8, 2007, Mark Klein, a former AT&amp;T technician, told &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Olbermann\"&gt;Keith Olbermann&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"MSNBC\"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; that all Internet traffic passing over AT&amp;T lines was copied into &lt;a href=\"Room%20641A\"&gt;a locked room&lt;/a&gt; at the company's San Francisco office \u2013 to which only employees with National Security Agency clearance had access.\nAT&amp;T keeps for five to seven years a record of who text messages whom and the date and time, but not the content of the messages.\nAT&amp;T has a one star &lt;a href=\"privacy\"&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt; rating from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nCopyright enforcement.\nIn January 2008, reports emerged that the company planned to begin filtering all &lt;a href=\"Internet%20traffic\"&gt;Internet traffic&lt;/a&gt; which passed through its network for intellectual property violations. Media commentators speculated that if this plan was implemented, it would have led to a mass exodus of subscribers from AT&amp;T, although Internet traffic of non-subscribers may have gone through the company's network anyway. Internet freedom proponents used these developments as justification for government-mandated &lt;a href=\"network%20neutrality\"&gt;network neutrality&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder AT&amp;T's current copyright enforcement program, content owners may notify AT&amp;T when they allege unlawful sharing of material. The program is based on IP addresses visible to content owners in peer-to-peer networks, not on filtering. AT&amp;T has terminated the broadband service of some customers accused of copyright infringement.\nDiscrimination against local public-access television channels.\nIn 2009 AT&amp;T was accused by &lt;a href=\"community%20media\"&gt;community media&lt;/a&gt; groups of discriminating against local &lt;a href=\"public%2C%20educational%2C%20and%20government%20access\"&gt;public, educational, and government access&lt;/a&gt; (PEG) cable TV channels, by \"impictions that will severely restrict the audience\".\nAccording to Barbara Popovic, executive director of the Chicago public-access service &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Access%20Network%20Television\"&gt;CAN-TV&lt;/a&gt;, the new AT&amp;T &lt;a href=\"U-verse\"&gt;U-verse&lt;/a&gt; system forced all &lt;a href=\"Public-access%20television\"&gt;Public-access television&lt;/a&gt; into a special menu system, denying normal functionality such as channel numbers, access to the standard &lt;a href=\"program%20guide\"&gt;program guide&lt;/a&gt;, and DVR recording. The Ratepayer Advocates division of the &lt;a href=\"California%20Public%20Utilities%20Commission\"&gt;California Public Utilities Commission&lt;/a&gt; reported: \"Instead of putting the stations on individual channels, AT&amp;T has bundled community stations into a generic channel that can only be navigated through a complex and lengthy process.\"\nSue Buske (president of telecommunications consulting firm the Buske Group and a former head of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers/&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20for%20Community%20Media\"&gt;Alliance for Community Media&lt;/a&gt;) argue that this is \"an overall attack [...] on public access across the [United States], the place in the dial around cities and communities where people can make their own media in their own communities\".\nInformation security.\nIn June 2010, a &lt;a href=\"hacker%20group\"&gt;hacker group&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Goatse%20Security\"&gt;Goatse Security&lt;/a&gt; discovered a &lt;a href=\"Vulnerability%20%28computing%29\"&gt;vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; within AT&amp;T that could allow anyone to uncover email addresses belonging to customers of AT&amp;T 3G service for the &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Inc.\"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"iPad\"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;. These email addresses could be accessed without a protective password. Using a script, Goatse Security collected thousands of email addresses from AT&amp;T. Goatse Security informed AT&amp;T about the security flaw through a third party. Goatse Security then disclosed around 114,000 of these emails to &lt;a href=\"Gawker%20Media\"&gt;Gawker Media&lt;/a&gt;, which published an article about the security flaw and disclosure in \"&lt;a href=\"Valleywag\"&gt;Valleywag&lt;/a&gt;\". Praetorian Security Group criticized the web application that Goatse Security exploited as \"poorly designed\".\nIn April 2015, AT&amp;T was fined $25 million over data security breaches, marking the largest ever fine issued by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Communications%20Commission\"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FCC) for breaking data privacy laws. The investigation revealed the theft of details of approximately 280,000 people from call centres in Mexico, &lt;a href=\"Colombia\"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccusations of enabling fraud.\nIn March 2012, the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT&amp;T. The specific accusations state that AT&amp;T \"violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes. The complaint alleges that, out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline, AT&amp;T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that AT&amp;T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated the use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers, which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT&amp;T's call volume. The government's complaint alleges that AT&amp;T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result.\" In 2013, AT&amp;T entered into a consent decree with the FCC and paid a total of $21.75 million.\nRacism.\nOn April 28, 2015, AT&amp;T announced that it had fired Aaron Slator, President of Content and Advertising Sales, for sending racist text messages. Slator was also hit with a $100 million discrimination lawsuit, filed by African-American employee Knoyme King. The day before that, protesters arrived at AT&amp;T's headquarters in Dallas and its satellite offices in Los Angeles as well as at the home of CEO Randall Stephenson to protest alleged systemic racial policies. According to accounts, the protesters demanded that AT&amp;T begin working with 100% black-owned media companies.\nOn January 24, 2017, Slator sued AT&amp;T in the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20County%20Superior%20Court\"&gt;Los Angeles Superior Court&lt;/a&gt;, accusing the company of &lt;a href=\"defamation\"&gt;defamation&lt;/a&gt; and wrongful termination. Slator had been involved in organizing AT&amp;T's planned $48.5 billion acquisition of DirecTV since 2014, and he claimed that when news headlines speculated that his text messages could prevent the acquisition from going through, he was fired as a \"scapegoat\" by company executives. He also claimed that the executives had known about the text messages since at least late 2013, and had promised him at the time that he would not be fired for them. The company stood by its decision to terminate Slator.\nOvercharging government agencies.\nIn 2020 AT&amp;T paid out $48 million to settle a lawsuit with 30 government entities. The suit (under the California False Claims Act) related to contractual undertakings to provide services at \"the lowest cost available\". AT&amp;T denied any wrongdoing in the matter.\nOne America News Network.\nAn investigative report by Reuters in 2021 revealed that AT&amp;T played a key role in creating, funding and sustaining &lt;a href=\"One%20America%20News%20Network\"&gt;One America News Network&lt;/a&gt; (OAN), a far-right TV network known for its promotion of far-right conspiracy theories and falsehoods. According to 2020 sworn testimony by an OAN accountant, 90% of OAN revenue came from AT&amp;T. According to OAN founder &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Herring%20%28businessman%29\"&gt;Robert Herring Sr.&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;T wanted to create a conservative network to compete with Fox News. Court documents showed OAN promised to \"cast a positive light\" on AT&amp;T during newscasts. AT&amp;T denied the allegations. Comedian &lt;a href=\"John%20Oliver\"&gt;John Oliver&lt;/a&gt; criticized AT&amp;T in his weekly show for funding OAN as \"a far-right channel that peddles COVID misinformation and conspiracy theories\" which is a \"toxic network\" and one that is \"happy to give a platform to batshit election-fraud theories from America\u2019s most out-of-breath pillow fetishist &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Lindell\"&gt;Mike Lindell&lt;/a&gt;.\""
