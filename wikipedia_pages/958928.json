    "text": "Henry Barbosa Gonz\u00e1lez (born Enrique Barbosa Gonz\u00e1lez; May 3, 1916 \u2013 November 28, 2000) was an American &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20state\"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, who represented &lt;a href=\"Texas%27s%2020th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;Texas's 20th congressional district&lt;/a&gt; from 1961 to 1999.\nEarly life.\nGonz\u00e1lez was born in &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas\"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Mexican-born parents Genoveva (n\u00e9e Barbosa) and Leonides Gonzalez (from Mapimi, Durango), who had immigrated during the &lt;a href=\"Mexican%20Revolution\"&gt;Mexican Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. After he received an &lt;a href=\"associate%27s%20degree\"&gt;associate's degree&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio%20College\"&gt;San Antonio College&lt;/a&gt;, he earned his undergraduate credentials from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin\"&gt;University of Texas at Austin&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he received a &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Doctorate\"&gt;Juris Doctorate&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"St.%20Mary%27s%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;St. Mary's University School of Law&lt;/a&gt;, also in San Antonio. Upon graduation, he became a probation officer, and was quickly promoted to the chief office of &lt;a href=\"Bexar%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Bexar County, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. In 1945, he quit after a judge refused to allow him to add an African-American probation officer to his staff. In 1950, he was &lt;a href=\"Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America\"&gt;scoutmaster&lt;/a&gt; of Troop 90 in San Antonio, of which his &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Gonzalez\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; was a member.\nCareer in local and state politics.\nGonz\u00e1lez served on the San Antonio City Council from 1953 to 1956. As a city councilmember, Gonz\u00e1lez helped desegregate swimming pools and other public accommodations in San Antonio.\nIn 1956, he defeated &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; candidate Jesse Oppenheimer for a seat in the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Senate\"&gt;Texas Senate&lt;/a&gt;. In 1960, he defeated another Republican, Ika \"Ike\" Simpson Kampmann, Jr. (1918-2006), to hold his state Senate seat. He remained in the Senate until 1961 and set the filibuster record in the chamber at the time by speaking for thirty-six straight hours against a set of bills on &lt;a href=\"Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;segregation&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the bills were abandoned (eight out of ten).\nHe ran for &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Texas\"&gt;governor&lt;/a&gt; in 1958 and finished second in the Democratic &lt;a href=\"primary%20election\"&gt;primary&lt;/a&gt; (the real contest for governor in what was then a solidly Democratic state) to &lt;a href=\"Price%20Daniel\"&gt;Price Daniel&lt;/a&gt;. In May 1961, Gonz\u00e1lez ran in the special election for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; seat that &lt;a href=\"Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson\"&gt;Lyndon B. Johnson&lt;/a&gt; vacated to become &lt;a href=\"Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U.S. Vice President&lt;/a&gt;. He finished in sixth place in part because he split the liberal and Hispanic vote with &lt;a href=\"Maury%20Maverick%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Maury Maverick, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, of San Antonio.\nHouse of Representatives.\nIn September 1961, President &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; appointed Rep. &lt;a href=\"Paul%20J.%20Kilday\"&gt;Paul J. Kilday&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Texas%27s%2020th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;Texas's 20th congressional district&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Court of Military Appeals&lt;/a&gt;. Gonz\u00e1lez entered the special election for the San Antonio-based district in November 1961 and defeated a strong Republican candidate, attorney &lt;a href=\"John%20W.%20Goode\"&gt;John W. Goode&lt;/a&gt;, for whom former U.S. President &lt;a href=\"Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower\"&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt; flew to San Antonio to endorse. Mexican film star &lt;a href=\"Cantinflas\"&gt;Cantinflas&lt;/a&gt; appeared with Vice President Johnson at &lt;a href=\"shopping%20center\"&gt;shopping center&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"supermarket\"&gt;supermarket&lt;/a&gt;s in San Antonio to support Gonz\u00e1lez, who would never face another contest nearly that close. He was unopposed for a full term in 1962 and was reelected seventeen times thereafter. He never faced truly serious or well-funded opposition, having been unopposed in 1970, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1982, and 1984. In fact, the 20th district was (and remains) so heavily Democratic that Gonz\u00e1lez faced Republican opposition only five times and handily prevailed whenever challenged.\nGonz\u00e1lez became known for his staunchly liberal views. In 1963, Republican U.S. Representative &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Foreman\"&gt;Ed Foreman&lt;/a&gt; called Gonz\u00e1lez a \"&lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt;\" and a \"&lt;a href=\"pinko\"&gt;pinko&lt;/a&gt;\" and Gonz\u00e1lez confronted him. Gonz\u00e1lez was again referred to as a \"communist\" in 1986 by a man at &lt;a href=\"Earl%20Abel%27s\"&gt;Earl Abel's&lt;/a&gt; restaurant, a popular San Antonio eatery. The 70-year-old representative responded by punching him in the face. Gonz\u00e1lez was acquitted of assault for this incident when the restaurant patron dropped the charge.\nUnlike many southern politicians at the time, Gonz\u00e1lez vocally supported civil rights proposals. He voted in favor of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964\"&gt;Civil Rights Acts of 1964&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201968\"&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965\"&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965&lt;/a&gt;.\nGonz\u00e1lez was in President Kennedy's &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;fateful motorcade&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Dallas\"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt; on November 22, 1963. He recalled rolling down the window as his car neared the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20School%20Book%20Depository\"&gt;Texas School Book Depository&lt;/a&gt;, then hearing three distinct shots during the assassination. Gonz\u00e1lez's car proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Parkland%20Memorial%20Hospital\"&gt;Parkland Memorial Hospital&lt;/a&gt; where, upon seeing a blood-soaked bouquet of roses in the rear of the &lt;a href=\"SS-100-X\"&gt;presidential limousine&lt;/a&gt;, he initially believed &lt;a href=\"Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20Onassis\"&gt;Jackie Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; had been shot. There, he saw Lyndon Johnson, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Bird%20Johnson\"&gt;Lady Bird Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, Mrs. Kennedy, and President Kennedy's sheet covered body. Gonz\u00e1lez helped place Kennedy's casket in the hearse that transported Kennedy to &lt;a href=\"Air%20Force%20One\"&gt;Air Force One&lt;/a&gt;.\nReported to be unsettled by the effect that the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, &lt;a href=\"assassination%20of%20Robert%20F.%20Kennedy\"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.\"&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/a&gt; had on the nation, Gonz\u00e1lez pushed in 1975 for a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20current%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20committees\"&gt;House committee&lt;/a&gt; study. In 1976, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Assassinations\"&gt;United States House Select Committee on Assassinations&lt;/a&gt; (HSCA) was created to investigate the deaths of President Kennedy and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt;, and Gonz\u00e1lez succeeded &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20N.%20Downing\"&gt;Thomas N. Downing&lt;/a&gt; as its chairman in January 1977. After a power struggle with the HSCA's &lt;a href=\"counsel\"&gt;counsel&lt;/a&gt;, he resigned as the committee's chairman that same year. Shortly before Gonz\u00e1lez chaired the HSCA, Robert P. Gemberling, head of the FBI's investigation of the Kennedy assassination for thirteen years after the release of the &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Commission\"&gt;Warren Commission&lt;/a&gt;'s report, said Gonz\u00e1lez, as well as Downing, had \"preconceived conspiracy theories\". According to a 1992 report, Gonz\u00e1lez did not rule out the possibility of shots other than the three he heard were fired from a &lt;a href=\"Suppressor\"&gt;silencer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20invasion%20of%20Grenada\"&gt;United States invasion of Grenada&lt;/a&gt; in 1983, Gonz\u00e1lez suggested the &lt;a href=\"impeachment%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;impeachment&lt;/a&gt; of President &lt;a href=\"Ronald%20Reagan\"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt;, and he introduced articles of impeachment related to the &lt;a href=\"Iran%E2%80%93Contra%20scandal\"&gt;Iran\u2013Contra scandal&lt;/a&gt; and sent them to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Judiciary%20Committee\"&gt;House Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt; in 1987. No further action was taken on said articles. Gonz\u00e1lez later called for the impeachment of President &lt;a href=\"George%20H.%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; for not obtaining &lt;a href=\"War%20Powers%20Resolution\"&gt;Congressional approval&lt;/a&gt; before the 1991 &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20War\"&gt;Gulf War&lt;/a&gt;. Early in the &lt;a href=\"presidency%20of%20Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;presidency of Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, Gonz\u00e1lez also blocked hearings into the &lt;a href=\"Whitewater%20controversy\"&gt;Whitewater controversy&lt;/a&gt; until finally agreeing to hold hearings in 1994. Gonz\u00e1lez was an outspoken critic of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Reserve%20System\"&gt;Federal Reserve System&lt;/a&gt;, and proposed an audit and introduced bills to impeach &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Volcker\"&gt;Paul Volcker&lt;/a&gt; and other Governors of the Federal Reserve.\nRetirement.\nIn 1997, Gonz\u00e1lez fell ill and was unable to return to the House for over a year. Finally, he decided not to run for a 19th full term in 1998. He died in a &lt;a href=\"San%20Antonio\"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; hospital on November 28, 2000.\nHe had long groomed his son, &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Gonzalez\"&gt;Charlie&lt;/a&gt;, to succeed him. Charlie Gonzalez won easily in 1998 and served through January 2013; between them, father and son served 52 consecutive years in Congress."
