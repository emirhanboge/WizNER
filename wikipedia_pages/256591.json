It is one of the five major &lt;a href=\"newspapers%20in%20Japan\"&gt;newspapers in Japan&lt;/a&gt;; the other four are the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Asahi%20Shimbun\"&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Chunichi%20Shimbun\"&gt;Chunichi Shimbun&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Shimbun\"&gt;Tokyo Shimbun&lt;/a&gt;)\" the \"&lt;a href=\"Mainichi%20Shimbun\"&gt;Mainichi Shimbun&lt;/a&gt;\", and the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Nikkei\"&gt;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&lt;/a&gt;\". The headquarters is in &lt;a href=\"Otemachi\"&gt;Otemachi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chiyoda%2C%20Tokyo\"&gt;Chiyoda, Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nBoasts an overwhelming share in South Kanto.\nIt is a newspaper that represents Tokyo and is based on conservatism. It is one of Japan's leading newspapers, along with the Osaka-based &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Third%20way\"&gt;Third way&lt;/a&gt;) Asahi Shimbun and the Nagoya-based &lt;a href=\"Social%20democratic\"&gt;Social democratic&lt;/a&gt; Chunichi Shimbun.\nIt is published by regional bureaus, all of them subsidiaries of &lt;a href=\"%23Yomiuri%20Group\"&gt;The Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings&lt;/a&gt;, Japan's largest media conglomerate by revenue and the second largest media conglomerate by size behind &lt;a href=\"Sony\"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;, which is privately held and controlled, directly and indirectly, by the Sh\u014driki family - descendants and relatives of &lt;a href=\"Matsutar%C5%8D%20Sh%C5%8Driki\"&gt;Matsutar\u014d Sh\u014driki&lt;/a&gt;. The Holdings has been owned by the family since Matsutar\u014d Sh\u014driki's purchase of the newspaper in 1924 (currently owning a total of 45.26% stock); despite its control, the family is not involved in its executive operations.\nFounded in 1874, the \"Yomiuri Shimbun\" is credited with having the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20newspapers%20in%20the%20world%20by%20circulation\"&gt;largest newspaper circulation in the world&lt;/a&gt; as of 2019, having a morning circulation of 7.7 million as of June 2020. The paper is printed twice a day and in several different local editions.\n\"Yomiuri Shimbun\" established the &lt;a href=\"Yomiuri%20Prize\"&gt;Yomiuri Prize&lt;/a&gt; in 1949. Its winners have included &lt;a href=\"Yukio%20Mishima\"&gt;Yukio Mishima&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Haruki%20Murakami\"&gt;Haruki Murakami&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe \"Yomiuri\" was launched in 1874 by the Nisshusha newspaper company as a small daily newspaper. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s the paper came to be known as a literary arts publication with its regular inclusion of work by writers such as &lt;a href=\"Ozaki%20K%C5%8Dy%C5%8D\"&gt;Ozaki K\u014dy\u014d&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1924, &lt;a href=\"Shoriki%20Matsutaro\"&gt;Shoriki Matsutaro&lt;/a&gt; took over management of the company. His innovations included improved news coverage, a full-page radio program guide, and the establishment of Japan's first professional baseball team, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Yomiuri%20Giants\"&gt;Yomiuri Giants&lt;/a&gt;. The emphasis of the paper shifted to broad news coverage aimed at readers in the Tokyo area. By 1941 it had the largest circulation of any daily newspaper in the Tokyo area. In 1942, under wartime conditions, it merged with the \"Hochi Shimbun\" and became known as the \"Yomiuri-Hochi\".\nThe \"Yomiuri\" was the center of a labor scandal in 1945 and 1946. In October 1945, a postwar \"democratization group\" called for the removal of Shoriki Matsutaro, who had supported Imperial Japan's policies during World War II. When Shoriki responded by firing five of the leading members of this group, the writers and editors launched the first \"production control\" strike on 27 October 1945. This method of striking became an important union tactic in the coal, railroad, and other industries during the postwar period. Shoriki Matsutaro was arrested in December 1945 as a &lt;a href=\"Class-A%20war%20criminal\"&gt;Class-A war criminal&lt;/a&gt; and sent to &lt;a href=\"Sugamo%20Prison\"&gt;Sugamo Prison&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Yomiuri\"'s employees continued to produce the paper without heeding executive orders until a police raid on June 21, 1946. The charges against Shoriki were dropped and he was released in 1948. According to research by Professor &lt;a href=\"Tetsuo%20Arima\"&gt;Tetsuo Arima&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Waseda%20University\"&gt;Waseda University&lt;/a&gt; on declassified documents stored at &lt;a href=\"NARA\"&gt;NARA&lt;/a&gt;, he agreed to work with the CIA as an informant.\nIn February 2009, the \"Yomiuri\" enterd into a tie-up with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal\"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" for editing, printing and distribution. Since March 2009 the major news headlines of the \"Journal\"'s Asian edition have been summarized in Japanese in the evening edition of the \"Yomiuri\".\nThe \"Yomiuri\" features an advice column, &lt;a href=\"Jinsei%20Annai\"&gt;Jinsei Annai&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Yomiuri\" has a history of promoting &lt;a href=\"nuclear%20power\"&gt;nuclear power&lt;/a&gt; in Japan. In May 2011, when &lt;a href=\"Naoto%20Kan\"&gt;Naoto Kan&lt;/a&gt;, then Prime Minister of Japan, asked the &lt;a href=\"Chubu%20Electric%20Power%20Company\"&gt;Chubu Electric Power Company&lt;/a&gt; to shut down several of its &lt;a href=\"Hamaoka%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant\"&gt;Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant&lt;/a&gt;s due to safety concerns, the \"Yomiuri\" called the request \"abrupt\" and a difficult situation for Chubu Electric's shareholders. It wrote that Kan \"should seriously reflect on the way he made his request.\" It then followed up with an article wondering how dangerous Hamaoka really was and called Kan's request \"a political judgment that went beyond technological worthiness.\" The next day damage to the pipes inside the condenser was discovered at one of the plants following a leak of seawater into the reactor.\nIn 2012, the paper reported that &lt;a href=\"Nobutaka%20Tsutsui\"&gt;Nobutaka Tsutsui&lt;/a&gt;, the Minister for Agriculture, had divulged secret information to a Chinese enterprise. Tsutsui sued the \"Yomiuri Shimbun\" for &lt;a href=\"libel\"&gt;libel&lt;/a&gt; and was awarded 3.3 million yen in damages in 2015, on the basis that the truth of the allegations could not be confirmed.\nIn November 2014, the newspaper apologized after using the phrase \"sex slave\" to refer to &lt;a href=\"comfort%20women\"&gt;comfort women&lt;/a&gt;, following its criticism of the \"Asahi Shimbun\"s coverage of Japan's World War II comfort women system.\nThe \"Yomiuri\" newspaper said in an editorial in 2011 \"No written material supporting the claim that government and military authorities were involved in the forcible and systematic recruitment of &lt;a href=\"comfort%20women\"&gt;comfort women&lt;/a&gt; has been discovered\", and that it regarded the &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Women%27s%20Fund\"&gt;Asian Women's Fund&lt;/a&gt;, set up to compensate for wartime abuses, as a failure based on a misunderstanding of history. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" reported on similar statements previously, writing that \"The nation's (Japan's) largest newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, applauded the revisions\" regarding removing the word \"forcibly\" from referring to laborers brought to Japan in the prewar period and revising the &lt;a href=\"comfort%20women\"&gt;comfort women&lt;/a&gt; controversy. \"Yomiuri\" editorials have also opposed the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Japan\"&gt;DPJ&lt;/a&gt; government and denounced denuclearization as \"not a viable option\".\nOther publications and ventures.\nYomiuri also publishes \"The Japan News\" (formerly called \"The Daily Yomiuri\"), one of Japan's largest &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English-language&lt;/a&gt; newspapers. It publishes the daily \"&lt;a href=\"Hochi%20Shimbun\"&gt;Hochi Shimbun&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"sport\"&gt;sport&lt;/a&gt;-specific daily newspaper, as well as weekly and monthly &lt;a href=\"magazine\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s.\nYomiuri Shimbun Holdings owns the &lt;a href=\"Chuokoron-Shinsha\"&gt;Chuokoron-Shinsha&lt;/a&gt; publishing company, which it acquired in 1999, and the &lt;a href=\"Nippon%20Television\"&gt;Nippon Television&lt;/a&gt; network. It is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Asia%20News%20Network\"&gt;Asia News Network&lt;/a&gt;. The paper is known as the &lt;a href=\"de%20facto\"&gt;de facto&lt;/a&gt; financial patron of the &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"Yomiuri%20Giants\"&gt;Yomiuri Giants&lt;/a&gt;. They also sponsor the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Fantasy%20Novel%20Award\"&gt;Japan Fantasy Novel Award&lt;/a&gt; annually. It has been a sponsor of the &lt;a href=\"FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup\"&gt;FIFA Club World Cup&lt;/a&gt; every time it has been held in Japan since &lt;a href=\"2006%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;.\nDigital resources.\nIn November 1999, the \"Yomiuri Shimbun\" released a &lt;a href=\"CD-ROM\"&gt;CD-ROM&lt;/a&gt; titled \"The Yomiuri Shimbun in the &lt;a href=\"Meiji%20Era\"&gt;Meiji Era&lt;/a&gt;,\" which provided searchable archives of news articles and images from the period that have been digitalized from microfilm. This was the first time a newspaper made it possible to search digitalized images of newspaper pictures and articles as they appeared in print.\nSubsequent CD-ROMs, \"The &lt;a href=\"Taish%C5%8D%20period\"&gt;Taish\u014d Era&lt;/a&gt;\", \"The &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;pre-war&lt;/a&gt; Showa Era I\", and \"The pre-war Showa era II\" were completed eight years after the project was first conceived. \"Postwar Recovery\", the first part of a postwar &lt;a href=\"Sh%C5%8Dwa%20Era\"&gt;Sh\u014dwa Era&lt;/a&gt; series that includes newspaper stories and images until 1960, is on the way.\nThe system of indexing each newspaper article and image makes the archives easier to search, and the CD-ROMs have been well received by users as a result. This digital resource is available in most major academic libraries in the United States.\nYomiuri Group.\n conglomerate comprises many entities, including:"
