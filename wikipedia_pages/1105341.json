    "text": " (; also spelled \"ex-gratia\") is &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; for \"by favour\", and is most often used in a &lt;a href=\"legal\"&gt;legal&lt;/a&gt; context. When something has been done \"ex gratia\", it has been done voluntarily, out of kindness or grace. In &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, an \"ex gratia payment\" is a payment made without the giver recognising any &lt;a href=\"Legal%20liability\"&gt;liability&lt;/a&gt; or legal obligation.\nExamples.\nCompensation payments are often made ex gratia if a &lt;a href=\"government\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; or organization is prepared to compensate victims of an event such as an &lt;a href=\"accident\"&gt;accident&lt;/a&gt; or similar but not to admit liability to pay compensation or for causing the event.\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"Native%20Tongue%20Title\"&gt;Native Tongue Title&lt;/a&gt;"
