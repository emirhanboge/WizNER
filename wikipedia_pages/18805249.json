    "text": "The purpose of this article is to serve as an &lt;a href=\"Annotation\"&gt;annotated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Index%20%28publishing%29\"&gt;index&lt;/a&gt; of various modes of convergence and their logical relationships. For an expository article, see &lt;a href=\"Modes%20of%20convergence\"&gt;Modes of convergence&lt;/a&gt;. Simple logical relationships between different modes of convergence are indicated (e.g., if one implies another), formulaically rather than in prose for quick reference, and indepth descriptions and discussions are reserved for their respective articles.\n\"Guide to this index.\" To avoid excessive verbiage, note that each of the following types of objects is a special case of types preceding it: &lt;a href=\"set%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;set&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"topological%20space\"&gt;topological space&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"uniform%20space\"&gt;uniform space&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"topological%20abelian%20group\"&gt;topological abelian group&lt;/a&gt;s (TAG), &lt;a href=\"normed%20vector%20space\"&gt;normed vector space&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20space\"&gt;Euclidean space&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Complex%20number\"&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; numbers. Also note that any &lt;a href=\"metric%20space\"&gt;metric space&lt;/a&gt; is a uniform space. Finally, subheadings will always indicate special cases of their superheadings.\nThe following is a list of modes of convergence for:\nA sequence of elements {\"an\"} in a topological space (\"Y\").\n...in a uniform space (\"U\").\nImplications:\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 Convergence formula_1 Cauchy-convergence\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 Cauchy-convergence and convergence of a subsequence together formula_1 convergence.\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 \"U\" is called \"complete\" if Cauchy-convergence (for nets) formula_1 convergence.\nNote: A sequence exhibiting Cauchy-convergence is called a \"cauchy sequence\" to emphasize that it may not be convergent.\nA series of elements \u03a3\"bk\" in a TAG (\"G\").\nImplications:\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 Unconditional convergence formula_1 convergence (by definition).\n...in a normed space (\"N\").\nImplications:\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 Absolute-convergence formula_1 Cauchy-convergence formula_1 absolute-convergence of some grouping1.\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 Therefore: \"N\" is &lt;a href=\"Banach%20space\"&gt;Banach&lt;/a&gt; (complete) if absolute-convergence formula_1 convergence.\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 Absolute-convergence and convergence together formula_1 unconditional convergence.\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 Unconditional convergence formula_10 absolute-convergence, even if \"N\" is Banach.\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 If \"N\" is a Euclidean space, then unconditional convergence formula_11 absolute-convergence.\n1 Note: \"grouping\" refers to a series obtained by grouping (but not reordering) terms of the original series. A grouping of a series thus corresponds to a subsequence of its partial sums.\nA sequence of functions {\"fn\"} from a set (\"S\") to a topological space (\"Y\").\n...from a set (\"S\") to a uniform space (\"U\").\nImplications are cases of earlier ones, except:\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 Uniform convergence formula_1 both pointwise convergence and uniform Cauchy-convergence.\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 Uniform Cauchy-convergence and pointwise convergence of a subsequence formula_1 uniform convergence.\n...from a topological space (\"X\") to a uniform space (\"U\").\nFor many \"global\" modes of convergence, there are corresponding notions of \"a\") \"local\" and \"b\") \"compact\" convergence, which are given by requiring convergence to occur \"a\") on some neighborhood of each point, or \"b\") on all compact subsets of \"X\". Examples:\nImplications:\n\u00a0 - \u00a0 \"Global\" modes of convergence imply the corresponding \"local\" and \"compact\" modes of convergence.
