    "text": "The Hulton Colliery Company was a &lt;a href=\"coal%20mining\"&gt;coal mining&lt;/a&gt; company operating on the &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20Coalfield\"&gt;Lancashire Coalfield&lt;/a&gt; from the mid 19th century in &lt;a href=\"Over%20Hulton\"&gt;Over Hulton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westhoughton\"&gt;Westhoughton&lt;/a&gt;, then in the &lt;a href=\"historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;historic county&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lancashire\"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt;, England. The company had its origins in small coal mines on the northern part of the Hulton Park estate in 1571 owned by the &lt;a href=\"Hulton%20family%20of%20Hulton\"&gt;Hultons&lt;/a&gt; who had held the estate from &lt;a href=\"medieval\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; times.\nBackground.\nIn the early 19th century the mines were owned by &lt;a href=\"William%20Hulton\"&gt;William Hulton&lt;/a&gt; who was &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff%20of%20Lancashire\"&gt;High Sheriff of Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; in 1811 and in 1812 sentenced four men, including a 12-year-old boy, to be executed for their part in a &lt;a href=\"Luddite\"&gt;Luddite&lt;/a&gt; attack on &lt;a href=\"Westhoughton%20Mill\"&gt;Westhoughton Mill&lt;/a&gt;. His orders led to the &lt;a href=\"Peterloo%20Massacre\"&gt;Peterloo Massacre&lt;/a&gt; in 1819. In 1843 Hulton paid his colliers the &lt;a href=\"Wage%20slavery\"&gt;poorest wages&lt;/a&gt; in Lancashire. He remained opposed to permitting the right to &lt;a href=\"free%20assembly\"&gt;free assembly&lt;/a&gt; and was vehemently opposed to miners congregating with the object of forming a &lt;a href=\"Lancashire%20and%20Cheshire%20Miners%27%20Federation\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt;.\nHulton's pits thrived and in the 1820s were connected to the &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20and%20Leigh%20Railway\"&gt;Bolton and Leigh Railway&lt;/a&gt;. By 1840 there were pits situated to the north of the &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Preston%2C%20Lancashire\"&gt;Preston&lt;/a&gt; road (A6) and west of the &lt;a href=\"Bolton\"&gt;Bolton&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Leigh%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Leigh&lt;/a&gt; road (A579) and Hulton Lane.\nCompany.\nHulton established the Hulton Colliery Company in 1858 with a partner, Harwood Walcot Banner. After Hulton's death in 1864 his son, William F. Hulton succeeded him and became the sole owner in 1868 when the &lt;a href=\"partnership\"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; was dissolved. The company sank pits near Chequerbent. The Arley Pits and the School Pit were sunk north of the Manchester road and older workings were abandoned. The new pits were linked to the Bolton and Leigh Railway line at Pendlebury Fold where the company built &lt;a href=\"brickworks\"&gt;brickworks&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilliam Ford Hulton died in 1879 and was succeeded by William W. B. Hulton who sold his &lt;a href=\"mining%20rights\"&gt;mining rights&lt;/a&gt; to the Hulton Colliery Company Ltd.\nThe company expanded, and sank the &lt;a href=\"Shaft%20mining\"&gt;shafts&lt;/a&gt; for Chequerbent Colliery to the east of the railway line and south of the Manchester road in 1892. The shafts of Hulton Colliery's Bank Pit Nos 1&amp;2, the Klondike Pit, were sunk in 1897 south of Chequerbent Colliery and Bank Pit Nos 3&amp;4 shafts, the &lt;a href=\"Pretoria%20Pit%20disaster\"&gt;Pretoria Pit&lt;/a&gt;, were sunk between 1900 and 1901 close to the &lt;a href=\"Atherton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester\"&gt;Atherton&lt;/a&gt; boundary towards the south-west corner of the estate."
