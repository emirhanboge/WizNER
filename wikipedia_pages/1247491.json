    "title": "Portable audio player",
    "text": "A portable audio player is a personal &lt;a href=\"mobile%20device\"&gt;mobile device&lt;/a&gt; that allows the user to listen to recorded &lt;a href=\"sound%20recording\"&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt; while mobile. Sometimes a distinction is made between a \"portable\" player, battery-powered and with one or more small &lt;a href=\"loudspeaker\"&gt;loudspeaker&lt;/a&gt;s, and a \"personal\" player, listened to with &lt;a href=\"earphone\"&gt;earphone&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nPortable battery-operated &lt;a href=\"reel-to-reel%20tape%20recorder\"&gt;reel-to-reel tape recorder&lt;/a&gt;s were introduced in the 1950s, initially tending to be high-priced units for reporters, produced by &lt;a href=\"Uher%20%28brand%29\"&gt;Uher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nagra\"&gt;Nagra&lt;/a&gt;. Lower-priced units became available later. In the mid-1960s &lt;a href=\"Philips\"&gt;Philips&lt;/a&gt; introduced the battery-operated &lt;a href=\"compact%20cassette\"&gt;compact cassette&lt;/a&gt; recorder, originally used for recording speech. At about the same time the &lt;a href=\"8-track%20cartridge\"&gt;8-track&lt;/a&gt; player was introduced. It was very successful at the time, though bulky and inconvenient to use. There was a pause at the end of each track as the program changed. \nThe compact cassette, although physically much smaller than the 8-track cartridge, became capable of good sound quality as the technology developed, and longer cassette tapes became available. &lt;a href=\"Cassette%20deck\"&gt;Cassette deck&lt;/a&gt;s (not portable) were introduced for home use, and this encouraged the production of pre-recorded music cassettes.\nPersonal stereo.\nThe first truly personal &lt;a href=\"cassette%20player\"&gt;cassette player&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sony%20Walkman\"&gt;Sony Walkman&lt;/a&gt;, was introduced in 1979 and sold very well. It was much smaller than an 8-track player or the earlier cassette recorders, and was listened to with &lt;a href=\"stereophonic\"&gt;stereophonic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"headphones\"&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt;, unlike previous equipment which used small loudspeakers. Unlike small loudspeakers, headphones were capable of very good sound quality. All previous compact cassette devices could record as well as play back; Walkmans and similar devices often had no recording facility, but took advantage of the pre-recorded cassettes that had become widely available.\nDisk players.\nEarly personal CD players can play commercial CDs; later models can play recordable &lt;a href=\"CD-R\"&gt;CD-R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"CDRW\"&gt;CDRW&lt;/a&gt; media either copied from a pressed CD or containing MP3 and similar files.\nMedia players.\nIn 1998, digital audio players (DAPs) based on &lt;a href=\"flash%20memory\"&gt;flash memory&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hard%20disk\"&gt;hard disk&lt;/a&gt; storage became available (The &lt;a href=\"Rio%20PMP300\"&gt;Rio PMP300&lt;/a&gt; from Diamond Multimedia is widely considered to be the first mass market DAP). Files are usually compressed using &lt;a href=\"lossy%20compression\"&gt;lossy compression&lt;/a&gt;; this reduces file size at the cost of some loss of quality. The &lt;a href=\"trade-off\"&gt;trade-off&lt;/a&gt; between degree of compression and file size can be varied, although this is not an option for existing compressed files. The advantage of solid-state DAPs over hard disks and CDs is resistance to vibration, small size and weight, and low battery usage. Early solid-state DAPs had capacities of a few tens of kilobytes; capacities of many gigabytes are available."
