This list covers only &lt;a href=\"Multilateral%20treaty\"&gt;multilateral treaties&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., treaties by more than two countries). It does not include &lt;a href=\"Bilateral%20treaty\"&gt;bilateral treaties&lt;/a&gt; (treaties between only two countries). &lt;a href=\"Related%20rights\"&gt;Related rights&lt;/a&gt; provide &lt;a href=\"intellectual%20property\"&gt;intellectual property&lt;/a&gt; rights for performers, producers of sound recordings (&lt;a href=\"Sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction\"&gt;phonogram&lt;/a&gt;s) and broadcasting organisations. In some countries these rights are known simply as &lt;a href=\"copyright\"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt;, while other countries distinguish them from &lt;a href=\"authors%27%20rights\"&gt;authors' rights&lt;/a&gt;: in either case, the international laws which are concerned with them are distinct from those concerned with literary and artistic works under the &lt;a href=\"Berne%20Convention%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Literary%20and%20Artistic%20Works\"&gt;Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works&lt;/a&gt; and other treaties.\nTreaties.\nIn addition to these treaties, the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Counterfeiting%20Trade%20Agreement\"&gt;Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (ACTA) is a multilateral treaty governing multiple aspects of intellectual property, including copyright. , ACTA has been signed by 31 countries, but only ratified by Japan. If ACTA is ratified by six or more signatories, it will enter into force thirty days later.\n, &lt;a href=\"Eritrea\"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Islands\"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nauru\"&gt;Nauru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Palau\"&gt;Palau&lt;/a&gt;, and WTO Observer countries &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Somalia\"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"South%20Sudan\"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt; are not a party to any copyright convention.\nTable of parties.\nThe list below was taken from details supplied by &lt;a href=\"WIPO\"&gt;WIPO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"WTO\"&gt;WTO&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"%23References\"&gt;references&lt;/a&gt;): they are\ncorrect as of 2005-12-11 (2000-01-01 for the Universal Copyright Convention), and include some accessions after that date.
