    "text": "Clarrie Jordan (20 June 1922 \u2013 24 February 1992) was an English professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;footballer&lt;/a&gt; who played as a &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;centre forward&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Upton%20Colliery%20F.C.\"&gt;Upton Colliery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Doncaster Rovers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. He holds the Doncaster record of 42 &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; goals scored in one season, and jointly holds the record of scoring in 10 consecutive games in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nJordan started his football playing for Upton Colliery before joining Doncaster in April 1940.\nDoncaster Rovers.\nDuring the war years he scored 63 goals in 102 games for Rovers, plus he made guest appearances for &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aldershot%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Aldershot Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Birmingham City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe made his full debut for Doncaster in the 3rd Division North on 31 August 1946, winning 2\u20131 at home against &lt;a href=\"Rochdale%20F.C.\"&gt;Rochdale&lt;/a&gt;. That season was to be record breaking for both Clarrie and Doncaster, as he took the still standing club record of goals scored in one season, and they got the most points for any club in a league of 22 teams and with the two points for a win system, also still standing.\nIn that season he was the &lt;a href=\"1946%E2%80%9347%20Football%20League%23Third%20Division%20North\"&gt;League's&lt;/a&gt; top scorer, and scored three hat-tricks and got a club and League record of scoring in ten consecutive games. Only &lt;a href=\"John%20Aldridge\"&gt;John Aldridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jermain%20Defoe\"&gt;Jermain Defoe&lt;/a&gt; have equalled this feat in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following season in the higher league he scored 6 in 19 league appearances.\nSheffield Wednesday.\nIn February 1948 he was sold to nearby Sheffield Wednesday scoring on his debut against &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Park%20Avenue%20F.C.\"&gt;Bradford Park Avenue&lt;/a&gt;. That first season he scored only 2 more goals in 14 further appearances. The following season, he scored 14 in 33 games, and in the 1949-50 promotion season he netted 12 times in 26 games including 4 in a game against &lt;a href=\"Hull%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt;.\nJordan struggled for the remainder of his footballing life with injury and loss of form though he did score 6 goals in 12 matches in the First Division in the 1953\u201354 season. The following season, he played his final game on 18 September at &lt;a href=\"Brammall%20Lane\"&gt;Brammall Lane&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield United&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nIn later life he was landlord of the Schoolboy Inn at &lt;a href=\"Norton%2C%20Doncaster%23Norton\"&gt;Norton&lt;/a&gt;, Doncaster."
