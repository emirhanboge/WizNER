    "text": "Italo Montemezzi (August 4, 1875 \u2013 May 15, 1952) was an Italian &lt;a href=\"composer\"&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt;. He is best known for his &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"L%27amore%20dei%20tre%20re\"&gt;L'amore dei tre re&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The Love of the Three Kings\"), once part of the standard repertoire. It is now seldom performed.\nBiography.\nMontemezzi was born in &lt;a href=\"Vigasio\"&gt;Vigasio&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Verona\"&gt;Verona&lt;/a&gt;. He studied music at the &lt;a href=\"Milan%20Conservatory\"&gt;Milan Conservatory&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently taught harmony there for one year.\nHis opera \"L\u2019amore dei tre re\", written in 1913, launched his career and enabled him to devote himself to composition. His opera \"La nave\" had its world premiere in &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; in 1918. In 1919 he visited the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, conducting the American premiere of \"La nave\" at the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Opera%20Association\"&gt;Chicago Opera Association&lt;/a&gt; on November 18. He lived in &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; from 1939 and commemorated Italy's surrender with \"Italia mia\" (1944), but later made frequent trips to Italy. He returned permanently in 1949 and died in Vigasio three years later.\nOther non-operatic works include the &lt;a href=\"symphonic%20poem\"&gt;symphonic poem&lt;/a&gt; \"Paolo e Virginia\" (after \"&lt;a href=\"Paul%20et%20Virginie\"&gt;Paul et Virginie&lt;/a&gt;\") and the cantata \"The &lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20Songs\"&gt;Song of Songs&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAs a composer, Montemezzi was admired for combining traditional Italian lyricism with a &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Wagner&lt;/a&gt;ian approach to the use of the orchestra in opera, with instrumental color influenced by the works of &lt;a href=\"Claude%20Debussy\"&gt;Debussy&lt;/a&gt;."
