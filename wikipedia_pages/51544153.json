All five home games were played on campus in &lt;a href=\"Eugene%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Eugene&lt;/a&gt; at the new &lt;a href=\"Autzen%20Stadium\"&gt;Autzen Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, opened this season with a natural grass field (and replaced with &lt;a href=\"AstroTurf\"&gt;AstroTurf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1969%20Oregon%20Webfoots%20football%20team\"&gt;two years later&lt;/a&gt;).\nUnder first-year head coach &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Frei\"&gt;Jerry Frei&lt;/a&gt;, the Ducks were 2\u20138 overall and in the &lt;a href=\"Pac-12%20Conference\"&gt;Athletic Association of Western\u00a0Universities&lt;/a&gt; (AAWU, later renamed Pacific-8), in a tie for seventh place, and were outscored 193\u00a0to\u00a0104. The\u00a0Ducks met &lt;a href=\"1967%20USC%20Trojans%20football%20team\"&gt;USC&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since &lt;a href=\"1958%20Oregon%20Webfoots%20football%20team\"&gt;1958&lt;/a&gt;, the final &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Pacific Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; (PCC) season. (&lt;a href=\"1967%20UCLA%20Bruins%20football%20team\"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; was similarly off of UO's schedule until &lt;a href=\"1969%20Oregon%20Webfoots%20football%20team\"&gt;1969&lt;/a&gt;).\nOregon's two victories came against the &lt;a href=\"Palouse\"&gt;Palouse&lt;/a&gt; neighbors, &lt;a href=\"1967%20Idaho%20Vandals%20football%20team\"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; and\n&lt;a href=\"1967%20Washington%20State%20Cougars%20football%20team\"&gt;Washington State&lt;/a&gt;. After opening with five losses, shutouts in the last three, the win over the &lt;a href=\"1967%20Idaho%20Vandals%20football%20team\"&gt;Vandals&lt;/a&gt; on October 21 was the first for Frei and the first for Oregon in Autzen Stadium. The Ducks traveled to &lt;a href=\"Pullman%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Pullman&lt;/a&gt; two weeks later and defeated the Cougars for their sole conference win. In between, they lost to top-ranked USC in Los Angeles, but held junior running back &lt;a href=\"O.%20J.%20Simpson\"&gt;O. J. Simpson&lt;/a&gt; to just 63 yards on 23 carries. He was similarly contained the &lt;a href=\"1968%20Oregon%20Webfoots%20football%20team\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt; in Eugene.\nIn the season-ending &lt;a href=\"Oregon%E2%80%93Oregon%20State%20football%20rivalry\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; game at Autzen, the visiting #8 &lt;a href=\"1967%20Oregon%20State%20Beavers%20football%20team\"&gt;Oregon State&lt;/a&gt; \"Giant Killers\" were held scoreless for three quarters, but reached the end zone twice in the fourth period to win 14\u201310, their fourth straight in the rivalry.\nOregon's statistical leaders in 1967 were Eric Olson with 840 passing yards, Claxton Welch with 474 rushing yards, and Roger Smith with 402 receiving yards."
