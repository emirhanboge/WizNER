    "text": "The A4050 road connects &lt;a href=\"Barry%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan\"&gt;Barry, Vale of Glamorgan&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Culverhouse%20Cross\"&gt;Culverhouse Cross&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Cardiff\"&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. It is approximately long, and is the key link road between the M4 motorway and &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Cardiff International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Wenvoe\"&gt;Wenvoe&lt;/a&gt; village lies along the road. In 2008 the &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Assembly\"&gt;Welsh Assembly&lt;/a&gt; allocated \u00a3576,000 to road resurfacing and improvement, which as of 2012 was still ongoing. One area given specific attention is the area around &lt;a href=\"Pencoedtre\"&gt;Pencoedtre&lt;/a&gt; between Waycock Cross and Barry as housing development and a new crematorium has been created in recent times.\nAt Culverhouse Cross, the A4050 connects to the &lt;a href=\"A48%20road\"&gt;A48&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"A4232%20road\"&gt;A4232&lt;/a&gt;. The A48 links with &lt;a href=\"Cowbridge\"&gt;Cowbridge&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=\"Cowbridge%20Road%20West\"&gt;Cowbridge Road West&lt;/a&gt; which connects the western Cardiff district of &lt;a href=\"Ely%2C%20Cardiff\"&gt;Ely&lt;/a&gt; to Canton and the city centre. The A4232 links with the &lt;a href=\"M4%20motorway\"&gt;M4&lt;/a&gt; at junction 33 and &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20Bay\"&gt;Cardiff Bay&lt;/a&gt;."
