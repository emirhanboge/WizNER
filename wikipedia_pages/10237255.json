    "text": "Lee Sinnott (born 12 July 1965) is an English professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; manager and former player who was most recently manager of &lt;a href=\"Gainsborough%20Trinity%20F.C.\"&gt;Gainsborough Trinity&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a player, he was a &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;defender&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20F.C.\"&gt;Walsall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Watford%20F.C.\"&gt;Watford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.\"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Huddersfield Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Oldham Athletic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scarborough%20F.C.\"&gt;Scarborough&lt;/a&gt;. His biggest impact was at Bradford City, where he stayed for five years over two spells, making over 200 appearances. He made 505 appearances in the &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;English Football League&lt;/a&gt;, and 653 appearances in all competitions. He played in the &lt;a href=\"1984%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1984 FA Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; for Watford, taking home a runners-up medal.\nAs manager of &lt;a href=\"Farsley%20Celtic%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Farsley Celtic&lt;/a&gt; between 2003 and 2007, he won promotion three times in four seasons to take the club from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Northern Premier League&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20%28division%29\"&gt;Conference&lt;/a&gt;. This was followed by a short spell at &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt; in the 2007\u201308 season. He managed &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Park%20Avenue%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford Park Avenue&lt;/a&gt; for ten months in 2009, before returning to the game with &lt;a href=\"Altrincham%20F.C.\"&gt;Altrincham&lt;/a&gt; in May 2011. He led Altrincham to promotion out of the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20North\"&gt;Conference North&lt;/a&gt; via the play-offs in 2014, but was sacked in March 2016. He returned to management with &lt;a href=\"Gainsborough%20Trinity%20F.C.\"&gt;Gainsborough Trinity&lt;/a&gt; in February 2018, lasting 12 months in the role.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Aldridge\"&gt;Aldridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Staffordshire\"&gt;Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt;, he began his career at &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20F.C.\"&gt;Walsall&lt;/a&gt; as an apprentice, signing professional in 1982. He made 40 first-team appearances in his &lt;a href=\"1982%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;first season&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Fellows%20Park\"&gt;Fellows Park&lt;/a&gt; before he was sold to &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; runners-up &lt;a href=\"Watford%20F.C.\"&gt;Watford&lt;/a&gt; for a \u00a3130,000 fee in September 1983. His final appearance for the \"Saddlers\" came in an 8\u20131 defeat at &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;. There he was coached by &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Harrison%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Steve Harrison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Ward%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201951%29\"&gt;John Ward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Graham%20Taylor\"&gt;Graham Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, whilst playing alongside veteran centre-back &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Terry\"&gt;Steve Terry&lt;/a&gt;. He established himself in the first-team following &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Bolton\"&gt;Ian Bolton&lt;/a&gt;'s departure and an injuries to &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Sims%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Steve Sims&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Franklin%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Paul Franklin&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of his first season, when still only 18 years old, he played in the &lt;a href=\"1984%20FA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1984 FA Cup final&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Everton%20F.C.\"&gt;Everton&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, collecting a runners-up medal. However he went on to lose his place to new signing &lt;a href=\"John%20McClelland%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201955%29\"&gt;John McClelland&lt;/a&gt; and had to fit into the team as a full-back and at left midfield during the &lt;a href=\"1984%E2%80%9385%20Watford%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1984\u201385&lt;/a&gt; season. He helped Watford reach the semi-finals of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1986\u201387&lt;/a&gt; campaign and played at left-back across from &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Waddle\"&gt;Chris Waddle&lt;/a&gt; in the defeat to &lt;a href=\"Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.\"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1987, Sinnott moved down a division to &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt;. In his first season, he helped the \"Bantams\" qualify for the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; playoffs, but their promotion bid failed and two years later they were relegated. Sinnott spent one season in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt; before moving to First Division side &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.\"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. He was unable to establish a regular place in the first team and after two years he returned to Bradford.\nWhen Sinnott returned to &lt;a href=\"Valley%20Parade\"&gt;Valley Parade&lt;/a&gt; over the summer of 1993, Bradford were still in the third tier of the English league. He played in most of their first-team games that season, but the \"Bantams\" missed out on the play-offs and manager &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Stapleton\"&gt;Frank Stapleton&lt;/a&gt; was sacked. Sinnott followed his manager out of the exit door and signed for local rivals &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Huddersfield Town&lt;/a&gt;. He was made captain of &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Warnock\"&gt;Neil Warnock&lt;/a&gt;'s team, and guided them to the &lt;a href=\"1995%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20Final\"&gt;Second Division play-off victory&lt;/a&gt; in his first season. He spent two more seasons in &lt;a href=\"West%20Yorkshire\"&gt;West Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; before crossing the &lt;a href=\"Pennines\"&gt;Pennines&lt;/a&gt; and signing for local rivals &lt;a href=\"Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Oldham Athletic&lt;/a&gt;, who had just been relegated to the Second Division.\nSinnott played 31 games over two seasons at &lt;a href=\"Boundary%20Park\"&gt;Boundary Park&lt;/a&gt;, but Oldham struggled in a division that they had been expected to win promotion from, and in Sinnott's second season they narrowly avoided relegation to the Third Division. A year earlier, he had been loaned back to Bradford, but the move was not made permanent.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football\"&gt;1998\u201399&lt;/a&gt; campaign proved to be Sinnott's final season as a Football League player. Upon its conclusion he moved to &lt;a href=\"Scarborough%20F.C.\"&gt;Scarborough&lt;/a&gt;, who had just been relegated to the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20%28division%29\"&gt;Conference&lt;/a&gt;, and played 22 games in one season for a side who finished fourth in the country's highest non-league division. He then retired from playing after a career spanning almost 20 years.\nStyle of play.\nSinnott was a quick, athletic and versatile &lt;a href=\"Defender%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;defender&lt;/a&gt; who boasted excellent long-ball throwing ability.\nManagerial career.\nFarsley Celtic.\nSinnott was not out of football for long, and moved into management with non-league &lt;a href=\"Farsley%20Celtic%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Farsley Celtic&lt;/a&gt; in June 2003. His first success with the club was a third-place finish in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;Northern Premier League First Division&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2003\u201304&lt;/a&gt;, which earned the club promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Northern Premier League&lt;/a&gt;.\nSinnott would have achieved another promotion in his second season at &lt;a href=\"Throstle%20Nest\"&gt;Throstle Nest&lt;/a&gt; as Farsley topped the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Northern Premier League&lt;/a&gt; at the end of &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;the season&lt;/a&gt;. However this was only on &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20Association\"&gt;the FA&lt;/a&gt;'s decision that &lt;a href=\"Spennymoor%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Spennymoor United&lt;/a&gt;'s records were expunged after they folded. The other clubs in the promotion mix appealed and the FA reversed their decision to expunge the results, leaving Farsley in third place and having to compete in the play-offs. Despite a 1\u20130 semi final win over &lt;a href=\"Whitby%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Whitby Town&lt;/a&gt;, they lost in the final to &lt;a href=\"Workington%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Workington&lt;/a&gt; on penalties.\nAnother promotion was achieved in &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2005\u201306&lt;/a&gt;, as Sinnott and Farsley bounced back from their play-off set-back. This time Farsley finished fourth in the regulation season before defeating &lt;a href=\"Marine%20F.C.\"&gt;Marine&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130 and then &lt;a href=\"North%20Ferriby%20United%20A.F.C.\"&gt;North Ferriby United&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 in the final. Sinnott also added the West Riding County Cup to Farsley's trophy cabinet for the tenth time in the club's history, as they made it a double winning campaign in 2005\u201306.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2006\u201307&lt;/a&gt; season saw Sinnott steer Farsley to a third promotion in four seasons. Despite finishing fifth in the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20North\"&gt;Conference North&lt;/a&gt;, Lee lead the club to victory in the play offs ensuring Farsley Celtic's first ever appearance in &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20%28division%29\"&gt;the top flight of Non-League&lt;/a&gt;. In the play off campaign, Farsley beat favourites &lt;a href=\"Kettering%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Kettering Town&lt;/a&gt; in the semi final, before going on to beat &lt;a href=\"Hinckley%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Hinckley United&lt;/a&gt; in the final played at &lt;a href=\"Burton%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Burton Albion's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pirelli%20Stadium\"&gt;Pirelli Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. In the final Farsley Celtic had been 3\u20132 down with just over ten minutes remaining before two late goals saw a remarkable comeback and a 4\u20133 victory.\nFarsley's three promotions under Sinnott and the declines of &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford City&lt;/a&gt; and their local rivals &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt; meant that just one and two divisions separated Farsley from its neighbours, when seven years ago six divisions separated them.\nPort Vale.\nIn October 2007, Sinnott was linked with the vacant job at &lt;a href=\"EFL%20League%20One\"&gt;League One&lt;/a&gt; team &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt;, and on 1 November 2007 Farsley Celtic's chairman Andrew Firbank told fans that Sinnott would soon be leaving the club. However, hours later, confusion arose when Sinnott denied resigning. Five days later he was named the new Port Vale manager, ending the speculation about his future. Prominent backroom staff member &lt;a href=\"Dean%20Glover\"&gt;Dean Glover&lt;/a&gt; had hoped to gain the management spot himself, and so pondered resigning from the club, but eventually chose to remain as Sinnott's assistant. The only significant staff member Sinnott was allowed to bring in was scout Steve Joesbury. In his first league game in charge Vale lost to local rivals &lt;a href=\"Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.\"&gt;Crewe Alexandra&lt;/a&gt;. Sinnott achieved his first win in charge of the club at &lt;a href=\"Morecambe%20F.C.\"&gt;Morecambe&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; First Round, with Port Vale winning 2\u20130. However the Second Round held embarrassment for both Sinnott and the club, as &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Chasetown%20F.C.\"&gt;Chasetown&lt;/a&gt; (an eighth tier team 101 league places below the Vale) picked up a 1\u20131 draw at &lt;a href=\"Vale%20Park\"&gt;Vale Park&lt;/a&gt;, before making a giant-killing with a late goal on their home ground, after &lt;a href=\"Luke%20Rodgers\"&gt;Luke Rodgers&lt;/a&gt; missed two penalties. Sinnott warned of big changes at the club. He signed Chasetown duo &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Slater\"&gt;Chris Slater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Perry\"&gt;Kyle Perry&lt;/a&gt;, and heavily exploited the loan market. He ultimately proved unable to save the club from relegation, and they &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Port%20Vale%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;were relegated&lt;/a&gt; on 12 April 2008. With only 38 points from 46 games, they finished ahead of bottom-placed &lt;a href=\"Luton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Luton Town&lt;/a&gt; only thanks to a ten-point deduction inflicted upon Luton. In the summer ten players left or were offloaded by Sinnott, as he attempted to make room for new signings.\nTo make a success of the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Port%20Vale%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2008\u201309&lt;/a&gt; season, Sinnott brought in former &lt;a href=\"Hereford%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Hereford United&lt;/a&gt; defender &lt;a href=\"John%20McCombe\"&gt;John McCombe&lt;/a&gt;, and former &lt;a href=\"Middlesbrough%20F.C.\"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; midfielder &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Thompson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201989%29\"&gt;Steve Thompson&lt;/a&gt;. Both players cited Sinnott as their reason for joining the club. He also added experienced defender &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Stockley\"&gt;Sam Stockley&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Wycombe%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wycombe Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;); attacker &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201985%29\"&gt;Rob Taylor&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Nuneaton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Nuneaton Borough&lt;/a&gt;); midfielder &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Griffith%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Anthony Griffith&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Doncaster Rovers&lt;/a&gt;); and attacking midfielder &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Dodds\"&gt;Louis Dodds&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Leicester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Leicester City&lt;/a&gt;) to the squad. &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Collins%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201988%29\"&gt;Lee Collins&lt;/a&gt; also joined on an extended loan from &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;, and would sign a permanent contract with the club in January. He appointed Stockley as his captain. The team continued to struggle, and on 18 September Sinnott admitted that \"we are looking to improve, without a shadow of a doubt\". However a 4\u20131 home defeat to &lt;a href=\"Macclesfield%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Macclesfield Town&lt;/a&gt; two days later would prove to be Sinnott's last game in charge. He was sacked two days later, with the \"Valiants\" lying in 16th place. Three months on from his sacking, the club were yet to reach a compensation settlement with Sinnott, before an agreement was reached in February 2009. The club went on to finish the season in 18th place under Dean Glover. Despite the poor results Vale picked up during his reign, many of Sinnott's signings would become key players for the club over the next few seasons.\nBradford Park Avenue.\nSinnott was linked with a vacant position at newly promoted Northern Premier League side &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Park%20Avenue%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford Park Avenue&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2008. The club were unwilling to pursue the interest because of Sinnott's unresolved contract with Port Vale, and instead appointed his former Farsley assistant and successor John Deacey. However, despite Sinnott still taking legal action against Port Vale, Park Avenue appointed Sinnott as their new manager just one month later; Avenue were 11th in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;Northern Premier League Premier Division&lt;/a&gt; at the time of his appointment, with Deacey standing aside to become Sinnott's assistant once again. Sinnott's first game ended in a 2\u20130 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Eastwood%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Eastwood Town&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;the season&lt;/a&gt; Avenue were in seventh place, two points and two places outside the play-off zone. He admitted that \"the quality of the UniBond Premier is higher than I remember it to be three or four years ago. You don't get any freebies, without a shadow of a doubt.\"\nHe left by mutual consent in October 2009, after a summer spending spree failed to produce results on the pitch for the &lt;a href=\"2009%E2%80%9310%20Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2009\u201310&lt;/a&gt; season. Avenue recovered to finish the season in second place under Deacey, though lost to &lt;a href=\"Boston%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Boston United&lt;/a&gt; in the play-off final.\nAltrincham.\nIn May 2011, Sinnott was announced as the new manager of &lt;a href=\"Altrincham%20F.C.\"&gt;Altrincham&lt;/a&gt;, a club that had just been relegated from the Conference National into the Conference North. The club finished eighth in the Conference North in &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2011\u201312&lt;/a&gt;, before securing a play-off position with a fourth-place finish in &lt;a href=\"2012%E2%80%9313%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2012\u201313&lt;/a&gt;. They were beaten 4\u20132 by &lt;a href=\"Brackley%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Brackley Town&lt;/a&gt; in the play-off semi-finals. The \"Robins\" again qualified for the play-offs in the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2013\u201314&lt;/a&gt; campaign, and went on to secure promotion with a 2\u20131 extra-time victory over &lt;a href=\"Guiseley%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Guiseley&lt;/a&gt; in the play-off final. Altrincham finished 17th in the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;2014\u201315&lt;/a&gt; season, comfortably away from the relegation zone. He left Altrincham on 9 March 2016, following a run of seven league games without a victory that left the club 21st in the table, one point adrift of safety. His assistant, &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Tolson\"&gt;Neil Tolson&lt;/a&gt;, was appointed as his successor but could not save the club from relegation.\nGainsborough Trinity.\nOn 13 February 2018, Sinnott was appointed as manager of &lt;a href=\"Gainsborough%20Trinity%20F.C.\"&gt;Gainsborough Trinity&lt;/a&gt;, who were then just inside the National League North relegation zone. The \"Holy Blues\" ended the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20National%20League\"&gt;2017\u201318&lt;/a&gt; season in 20th position and were relegated into the Northern Premier League Premier Division. He remained at &lt;a href=\"The%20Northolme\"&gt;The Northolme&lt;/a&gt; for the start of the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;2018\u201319&lt;/a&gt; campaign, but was sacked exactly one year into his appointment, following a 5\u20130 defeat by league leaders Farsley Celtic which left Trinity four points outside the play-offs.\nPersonal life.\nHis son, &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Sinnott\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, was also a professional footballer. Sinnott signed his son for Altrincham in February 2015, following a previous loan spell. Jordan died at the age of 25 after being attacked during a night out on 25 January 2020.\nStatistics.\nPlaying statistics.\nSource:"
