    "title": "Bologna sausage",
    "text": "Bologna sausage, also spelled baloney (), is a &lt;a href=\"sausage\"&gt;sausage&lt;/a&gt; derived from &lt;a href=\"mortadella\"&gt;mortadella&lt;/a&gt;, a similar-looking, finely ground pork sausage containing cubes of pork fat, originally from the Italian city of &lt;a href=\"Bologna\"&gt;Bologna&lt;/a&gt; (). Typical seasoning for bologna includes &lt;a href=\"black%20pepper\"&gt;black pepper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nutmeg\"&gt;nutmeg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"allspice\"&gt;allspice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"celery%20seed\"&gt;celery seed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coriander\"&gt;coriander&lt;/a&gt; and, like mortadella, &lt;a href=\"myrtle%20%28common%29\"&gt;myrtle&lt;/a&gt; berries give it its distinctive flavor. Other common names include parizer (Parisian sausage) in the countries deriving from ex-&lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, polony in Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa and Western Australia, devon in most states of Australia, and fritz in South Australia.\nIn &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20cuisine\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, a simple and popular recipe is the &lt;a href=\"bologna%20sandwich\"&gt;bologna sandwich&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariations.\nAside from &lt;a href=\"pork\"&gt;pork&lt;/a&gt;, \"bologna\" can be made out of &lt;a href=\"chicken%20%28food%29\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"turkey%20meat\"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beef\"&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"venison\"&gt;venison&lt;/a&gt;, a combination of meats, or &lt;a href=\"soy%20protein\"&gt;soy protein&lt;/a&gt;.\nUS bologna.\nU.S. government regulations require American bologna to be finely ground, and without visible pieces of fat.\nLebanon bologna.\n&lt;a href=\"Lebanon%20bologna\"&gt;Lebanon bologna&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania%20Dutch\"&gt;Pennsylvania Dutch&lt;/a&gt; prepared meat. While called bologna, it is a dried, smoked beef sausage similar to &lt;a href=\"salami\"&gt;salami&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolony.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, \"polony\" is a finely ground pork-and-beef sausage. The name, likely derived from Bologna, has been in use since the 17th century. The modern product is usually cooked in a red or orange skin and is served as cold slices.\nIn &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; \"polony\" is a type of &lt;a href=\"cocktail%20sausage\"&gt;cocktail sausage&lt;/a&gt; with pink or red artificially coloured skin similar to, but much smaller than, a &lt;a href=\"Saveloy\"&gt;Saveloy&lt;/a&gt;. Miniature polonies in New Zealand are called \"Cheerios\". They are eaten boiled.\nSouth African \"polony\" is similar to bologna in constitution and appearance, and is typically inexpensive. Large-diameter (artificially coloured) pink polonies are called French polony, with thinner rolls referred to simply as polony. Garlic polony is also widely available.\nIn 2018, a South African factory that produced polony and other processed meats was associated with &lt;a href=\"2017%20South%20African%20listeriosis%20outbreak\"&gt;a listeriosis outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that killed approximately 180 people and sickened a further thousand.\nRag bologna.\nRag bologna is a long stick, or \"chub\", of high-fat bologna native to West Tennessee and its surrounding area. Unavailable beyond it, the sausage is traditionally sold wrapped in a cloth rag. The recipe has a higher content of filler than that of regular bologna. Milk solids, flour, cereal, and spices are added during processing, and the roll of bologna is bathed in &lt;a href=\"lactic%20acid\"&gt;lactic acid&lt;/a&gt; before being coated in &lt;a href=\"paraffin%20wax\"&gt;paraffin wax&lt;/a&gt;. It is generally eaten on white bread with mustard and pickles, but is also a staple of family gatherings, where thick slices are smoked and barbecued along with other meats. In &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland\"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;, a type of rag bologna referred to as \"wax\" bologna is sliced thickly and fried, which is referred to as \"Newfie steak\".\nRing bologna.\nRing bologna is much smaller in diameter than standard bologna. It is better suited for slicing and serving on crackers, either as a snack or \"&lt;a href=\"hors%20d%27oeuvre\"&gt;hors d'oeuvre&lt;/a&gt;\". It is generally sold as an entire link rather than sliced. The link is arranged as a semicircle or \"ring\" when prepared for sale (hence the name). Pickled bologna is usually made from ring bologna soaked in vinegar and typical &lt;a href=\"pickling%20spice\"&gt;pickling spice&lt;/a&gt;s. It is usually served in chunks as a cold snack.\nVegetarian bologna.\nVarious vegetarian and vegan versions of bologna are available. A typical UK recipe uses &lt;a href=\"soy%20product\"&gt;soya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wheat%20protein\"&gt;wheat protein&lt;/a&gt; in the place of lean meat and palm oil instead of fat together with starch, &lt;a href=\"carrageenan\"&gt;carrageenan&lt;/a&gt;, and flavorings. It can be eaten cold or cooked in the same ways as traditional bologna."
