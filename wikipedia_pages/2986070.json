    "text": "The Bahrain National Museum () is the largest and oldest public &lt;a href=\"museum\"&gt;museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bahrain\"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;. It is situated in &lt;a href=\"Manama\"&gt;Manama&lt;/a&gt;, adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Theatre%20of%20Bahrain\"&gt;National Theatre of Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;. Opened on 15 December 1988 by the &lt;a href=\"Emir%20of%20Bahrain\"&gt;Emir of Bahrain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Isa%20bin%20Salman%20Al%20Khalifa\"&gt;Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa&lt;/a&gt;, the $30 million museum complex covers 27,800 sq meters and is the country's most popular tourist attraction. It is believed to be the &lt;a href=\"Arab%20States%20of%20the%20Persian%20Gulf\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;'s first modern museum.\nHistory.\nIn 1957, the first exhibition of archaeological artifacts in Bahrain occurred at the Hidaya Boys School in &lt;a href=\"Muharraq\"&gt;Muharraq&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with the Danish Archaeological Expedition sent to the &lt;a href=\"Bahrain%20Fort\"&gt;Bahrain Fort&lt;/a&gt;. The temporary exhibition lasted for a few days but drew significant interest in archaeology from the Bahraini community. In 1967, a cultural agreement was signed between &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; and the Bahraini government which helped pave the way for the construction of a national museum. A national museum was first opened at Government House in &lt;a href=\"Manama\"&gt;Manama&lt;/a&gt; on 4 March 1970 by the head of state council at the time, &lt;a href=\"Khalifa%20bin%20Salman%20Al%20Khalifa\"&gt;Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe modern museum was designed by Danish architects &lt;a href=\"Krohn%20%26amp%3B%20Hartvig%20Rasmussen\"&gt;Krohn &amp; Hartvig Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; and officially opened in December 1988. It was constructed on an artificial peninsula overlooking the neighbouring island of &lt;a href=\"Muharraq\"&gt;Muharraq&lt;/a&gt;. The museum is made of two buildings spanning a floor space of 20,000 square meters. The complex contains six permanent exhibitions, an educational hall, a &lt;a href=\"gift%20shop\"&gt;gift shop&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"cafeteria\"&gt;cafeteria&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to administrative offices, laboratories and warehouses for the Conservation of holdings and parking. The museum celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013 by renovating the Hall of Dilmun Graves, and hosting an international conference on museum development.\nThe museum is open from 10 am to 6 pm, with the complex being closed on Tuesdays. The museum also offers regular daytime boat trips to the &lt;a href=\"Bu%20Maher%20Fort\"&gt;Bu Maher Fort&lt;/a&gt; on Muharraq island, a part of the &lt;a href=\"Bahrain%20Pearling%20Trail\"&gt;Bahrain Pearling Trail&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollections.\nThe museum possess a collection of &lt;a href=\"Bahrain\"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;'s ancient &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;archaeological&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"artifact%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s acquired since 1988, and covering around 5000 years of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Bahrain\"&gt;Bahrain's history&lt;/a&gt;. The complex includes three halls devoted to archaeology and the ancient civilisation of the &lt;a href=\"Dilmun\"&gt;Dilmun&lt;/a&gt;, while two other halls depict the &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Bahrain\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; and lifestyle of Bahrain's recent pre-industrial past. In 1993, a further hall was opened, the &lt;a href=\"Natural%20History\"&gt;Natural History&lt;/a&gt; Hall, focusing on the &lt;a href=\"Bahrain%23Biodiversity\"&gt;natural environment&lt;/a&gt; of Bahrain. This hall features specimens of Bahrain's &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;.\nHall of Dilmun.\nThe exhibit focuses on artifacts and the history of the &lt;a href=\"Dilmun\"&gt;Dilmun&lt;/a&gt; civilization from 5000\u00a0BC to 400\u00a0BC, including its widespread trading network with &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20Valley\"&gt;Indus Valley&lt;/a&gt;. On display are Dilmunite &lt;a href=\"stamp%20seal\"&gt;stamp seal&lt;/a&gt;s, artifacts from &lt;a href=\"Barbar%20temple\"&gt;Barbar temple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sar%2C%20Bahrain%23History\"&gt;Saar Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and Dilmunite pottery. A notable exhibit is the &lt;a href=\"Durand%20Stone\"&gt;Durand Stone&lt;/a&gt;, a long black &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt; sculpture dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Babylonia\"&gt;Babylonia&lt;/a&gt;n era. Another feature is a &lt;a href=\"Tableau%20vivant\"&gt;tableau&lt;/a&gt; which depicts a scene from the &lt;a href=\"Epic%20of%20Gilgamesh\"&gt;Epic of Gilgamesh&lt;/a&gt; (in which reference to Bahrain is made as the paradise of &lt;a href=\"Dilmun\"&gt;Dilmun&lt;/a&gt;).\nHall of Dilmun Graves.\nThe exhibit focuses on burial practices of the &lt;a href=\"Dilmun\"&gt;Dilmun&lt;/a&gt; civilization and features an actual &lt;a href=\"Dilmun%20Burial%20Mounds\"&gt;burial mound&lt;/a&gt; which was transported from its site &lt;a href=\"A%27ali\"&gt;A'ali&lt;/a&gt; and reassembled within the museum. The hall was closed for renovation in 2013 and re-opened to the public on 26 June 2018. Re-designed by French architect Didier Blin, the revamped hall features newly installed multimedia as well as findings from the most recent archaeological excavations. In 2019, the &lt;a href=\"Dilmun%20Burial%20Mounds\"&gt;Dilmun Burial Mounds&lt;/a&gt; of Bahrain were recognized as a &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;.\nHall of Tylos and Islam.\nThe hall covers the Hellenic-influenced history of Bahrain from the 2nd century BC onwards as well as interactions with the &lt;a href=\"Seleucid%20empire\"&gt;Seleucid empire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Characene\"&gt;Characene&lt;/a&gt; kingdom. This exhibit hosts glazed pottery and glasses, &lt;a href=\"alabaster\"&gt;alabaster&lt;/a&gt; containers and jewelry dating from that era.
