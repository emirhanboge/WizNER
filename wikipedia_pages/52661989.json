    "text": "Laathi nach is a cultural dance of the &lt;a href=\"Tharu%20people\"&gt;Tharu people&lt;/a&gt;, and is also known as the Tharu stick dance. This dance has been performed mainly near about &lt;a href=\"Dashain\"&gt;Dashain&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar to &lt;a href=\"Dandiya%20Raas\"&gt;Dandiya Raas&lt;/a&gt;, but this is a bit different in performance. In this ritual dance all &lt;a href=\"dancers\"&gt;dancers&lt;/a&gt; should be male or female only, as they must wake up holy sprite goddess &lt;a href=\"Durga\"&gt;Durga&lt;/a&gt;."
