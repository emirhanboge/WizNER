Since entering the NFL, Beckham has been one of the most popular players but has drawn media scrutiny for his personal conduct.\nBeckham started the &lt;a href=\"2012%20BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;2012 BCS National Championship Game&lt;/a&gt; in his first year playing at LSU, and won the &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Hornung%20Award\"&gt;Paul Hornung Award&lt;/a&gt; following his junior season in 2013. In his first season with the New York Giants, Beckham broke numerous NFL rookie receiving records, despite missing the first four games of the season due to injury. Beckham became the first player to record more than 75 receptions, 1,100 yards, and ten touchdowns in a rookie season, and broke the rookie record for the most average receiving yards per game. During Week 12 of his first season, Beckham came to national attention when he made a one-handed touchdown catch whilst falling backwards in a \"&lt;a href=\"NBC%20Sunday%20Night%20Football\"&gt;Sunday Night Football&lt;/a&gt;\" game against the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;, which numerous pundits and athletes called the greatest catch ever made. Beckham won the 2014 &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Offensive%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Offensive Rookie of the Year&lt;/a&gt; award.\nIn 2016, he became the fastest player in NFL history to reach both 200 career receptions and 4,000 career receiving yards.
