    "text": "Soldier's Joy is a historic &lt;a href=\"Plantation%20house%20in%20the%20Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; located at &lt;a href=\"Wingina%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Wingina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20County%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Nelson County, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, USA. It was built in 1784\u201385 by Col. &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Jordan%20Cabell\"&gt;Samuel Jordan Cabell&lt;/a&gt; and enlarged approximately twenty-five years later. Along with &lt;a href=\"Bon%20Aire\"&gt;Bon Aire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Montezuma%20%28Norwood%2C%20Virginia%29\"&gt;Montezuma&lt;/a&gt;, it is one of the few remaining Cabell family houses in Nelson County. When constructed it was a five-part &lt;a href=\"Palladian\"&gt;Palladian&lt;/a&gt; house; reduced in size during the 20th century when the early 19th-century wings were moved. The Late-&lt;a href=\"Georgian%20architecture\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt; dwelling is distinguished by its fine proportions and interior detailing, much of which was added when the house was enlarged. The elaborate woodwork from the ballroom wing was removed to the &lt;a href=\"Cincinnati%20Art%20Museum\"&gt;Cincinnati Art Museum&lt;/a&gt; when the house was renovated in the 1920s.\nIt was listed on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1980."
