    "text": "Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii (Country Council; ) was a council that united political, public, cultural, and professional organizations in the greater part of the territory of the &lt;a href=\"guberniya\"&gt;Governorate&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bessarabia\"&gt;Bessarabia&lt;/a&gt; in the disintegrating &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which was transformed into a &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20body\"&gt;Legislative body&lt;/a&gt; and proclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Moldavian%20Democratic%20Republic\"&gt;Moldavian Democratic Republic&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Democratic%20Federative%20Republic\"&gt;Russian Federative Republic&lt;/a&gt; in December 1917, and then &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Bessarabia%20with%20Romania\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; in .\nPrelude and organization.\nRussian participation in World War I.\nIn August 1914, the &lt;a href=\"First%20World%20War\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; started, and 300,000 Bessarabians were mobilized and enrolled in the army of the Russian Empire, the majority in the immediate wake of Russian defeat. By March 1917, the military actions on the Eastern Front came to a stalemate. Conferences of soldiers in the rear of the front line dominated. Many called for a &lt;a href=\"Republic\"&gt;Republic&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Tsar\"&gt;Tsar&lt;/a&gt; had abdicated in March 1917, but the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Provisional%20Government\"&gt;Russian Provisional Government&lt;/a&gt; that took his place had not proclaimed the Empire a Republic until September 1917. They wanted social and economic changes, such as annulment of the privileges of the nobility, and an &lt;a href=\"agrarian%20reform\"&gt;agrarian reform&lt;/a&gt; that would give the peasants the land they worked on.\nDespite the bad situation, the Army of the Russian Empire did not disband. Soldiers continued to form units, but often officers were replaced by new, elected ones. Units continued to be stationed as before and would not move without the consent of the general command. The soldiers also started making political claims, such as land reform, permission to use the national language in administration and courts, as well as education and church services in the national language. Some Bessarabian soldiers had numerous occasions to interact with soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Kingdom of Romania&lt;/a&gt;, and with ethnic Romanians from &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bukovina\"&gt;Bukovina&lt;/a&gt;, many of the latter taken prisoners from the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Army\"&gt;Austrian army&lt;/a&gt;, and organized in regiments now fighting on the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Entente&lt;/a&gt; side.\nContacts between Romanian intelligentsia in Austria-Hungary and in Russia were quite strong already before 1914, as many saw a common goal: building a national homeland for all Romanians. There were many divergent visions on how this could be achieved: some wanted all lands inhabited by Romanians to be reunited under the Austrian crown, others wanted an independent Romanian state, which might be closer either to the Central powers or to the Entente. At the time, less than half of all Romanians lived within the borders of what was then the Kingdom of Romania, and due to its small size, it had almost no influence over the two big neighboring empires. As a result, the Romanian intelligentsia in Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia had to seek political empowerment by itself, exchanging methods and tactics with each other. Transylvanian newspapers in Romanian, such as \"Ardealul\" of &lt;a href=\"Onisifor%20Ghibu\"&gt;Onisifor Ghibu&lt;/a&gt; were widespread in Bessarabia before World War I, where local newspapers such as \"&lt;a href=\"Cuv%C3%A2nt%20Moldovenesc%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Cuv\u00e2nt moldovenesc&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Via%C8%9Ba%20Basarabiei\"&gt;Via\u021ba Basarabiei&lt;/a&gt;\", although not completely outlawed, were targets of Russian authorities. With the overall recruitment for World War I, many representatives of Romanian intelligentsia found themselves as low-rank officers in Austrian and Russian armies.\nIn 1917, after the &lt;a href=\"February%20Revolution\"&gt;February Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sankt-Peterburg\"&gt;Petrograd&lt;/a&gt;, \"Moldavian Revolutionary Committees of Soldiers\" were organized in the major Russian cities where recruits from &lt;a href=\"Bessarabia\"&gt;Bessarabia&lt;/a&gt; were concentrated: &lt;a href=\"Odessa\"&gt;Odessa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kiev\"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sevastopol\"&gt;Sevastopol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kherson\"&gt;Kherson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Novogeorgievsk\"&gt;Novogeorgievsk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moroski\"&gt;Moroski&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Minsk%20gubernia\"&gt;Minsk gubernia&lt;/a&gt;) in Russia, as well as in &lt;a href=\"Ia%C8%99i\"&gt;Ia\u0219i&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%2C%20Romania\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A2rlad\"&gt;B\u00e2rlad&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;n Front, plus smaller ones. Among the main calls on their banners were \"Land and liberty\", \"Down with the war\", and \"Peoples's right to self-determination\". April 1917 was the month with most such gatherings in the Russian Empire. On , a huge meeting was held in Odessa, where more than 10,000 Bessarabian soldiers participated. The resolution adopted by the meeting demanded (a) political autonomy for Bessarabia, (b) organization in Bessarabia of Moldavian military units (\"&lt;a href=\"cohort%20%28military%20unit%29\"&gt;cohort&lt;/a&gt;s\") in order to stop the violence to the population produced by the deserting irregulars of the partially disintegrating &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russian%20Army\"&gt;Russian Army&lt;/a&gt;, news of which had reached the soldiers, making them feel very worried for the fate of their families. This \"congress\" was also attended by a number of Bessarabian students, who obtained from the Russian authorities the permission to hold for those interested Romanian history and literature courses at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Odessa\"&gt;University of Odessa&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a number of Bessarabian intellectuals, such as &lt;a href=\"Emanoil%20Catelli\"&gt;Emanoil Catelli&lt;/a&gt;, Balu\u021b\u0103, and others, who were most probably the authors of the resolution passed.\nLocal congresses.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"February%20Revolution\"&gt;February Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and the cessation of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; hostilities, various meetings and congresses were organized throughout Bessarabia, discussing the future of the country. Led by teachers and intellectuals, meetings were held and committees were set up in virtually every village, after which county-wide and Bessarabia-wide congresses of professional corporations \u2013 peasants, teachers, cooperators, clergy \u2013 were held. On \u2013, a congress of the representatives of the village cooperatives (\"The First Congress of Cooperatives of Bessarabia\") was held in &lt;a href=\"Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u\"&gt;Chi\u0219in\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; and voted a motion demanding political, administrative, educational, religious, and economic autonomy for Bessarabia and the formation of a legislative assembly \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\" (literally \"The Council of the Country\").\nThis was followed by other congresses, including those of soldiers, priests, students and teachers, all demanding self-rule. On \u2013, 1917, a Congress of Clergy and representatives of parish committees was held in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, demanding a Moldavian archbishop to head the Church in Bessarabia, political autonomy of Bessarabia, and the setting of a High Council as a national legislative and executive body. Similar motions were passed in all nine counties of Bessarabia.\nA \"General Congress of Bessarabian Teachers\" was held in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, and passed a motion to switch the primary language used in teaching from &lt;a href=\"Russian%20language\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20language\"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt;, to use the Latin alphabet, and supporting the demands of the other three congresses. On \u2013, the Congress of Moldavian Teachers decided to switch to the Latin alphabet. Among the notable speeches at that congress were the ones given by &lt;a href=\"Alexei%20Mateevici\"&gt;Alexei Mateevici&lt;/a&gt;, who asked that Bessarabians identify as \"&lt;a href=\"Romanians\"&gt;Romanians&lt;/a&gt;\" rather than \"&lt;a href=\"Moldovans\"&gt;Moldavians&lt;/a&gt;\", and of &lt;a href=\"Iulie%20Fr%C4%83%C8%9Biman\"&gt;Iulie Fr\u0103\u021biman&lt;/a&gt;, who asked that the areas beyond the Dniester inhabited by Romanians be administered by Bessarabia. These opinions weren't unanimous, as several protested being called \"Romanians\", affirming they were \"not Romanian\", but \"Moldavian\".\nDuring April, May and June 1917, a series of Peasant Congresses are held at local levels, demanding land, administrative, and social reform, and the autonomy of Bessarabia. On \u2013, the First General Congress of Peasants of All Bessarabia takes place in Chi\u0219in\u0103u. The Congress claimed that from the report of all the regions of Bessarabia, the land was taken over by an anarchic and public disorder current, to which the administration of Kerenski can not attend. Therefore, the Congress decided to found a Provisional Council of 100 members, 70 of which should be Moldavians and 30 should by representatives of minority groups. To this end, the Congress made up an organization commission. However, all this remained talk, and this organization commission has never done anything.\nLegal situation.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"February%20Revolution\"&gt;February Revolution&lt;/a&gt; took place in &lt;a href=\"Petrograd\"&gt;Petrograd&lt;/a&gt; in 1917, the governor of Bessarabia stepped down and passed his legal powers to &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Mimi\"&gt;Constantin Mimi&lt;/a&gt;, the President of the &lt;a href=\"Gubernial%20Zemstvo\"&gt;Gubernial Zemstvo&lt;/a&gt;, who was named \"the Commissar of the Provisional Government in Bessarabia\", with &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Criste\"&gt;Vladimir Criste&lt;/a&gt; his deputy. Similar procedures took place in all regions of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;; the chiefs of the Tsarist administrations passed their legal powers to the chiefs of the County and Governorate Zemstvos, which were then called \"County/Governorate Commissars\".\nSecurity situation.\nOfficers started to disband their troops, and soldiers tried to form groups of people from the same regions to return home. The sheer number of soldiers retreating put a strain on resources along their path home. As a consequence, on , general &lt;a href=\"Dmitriy%20Shcherbachov\"&gt;Dmitriy Shcherbachov&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Commander of the Russian Armies on the Romanian Front, by order 156370 agreed to form 16 cohorts exclusively of Moldavian soldiers, and commanded by Moldavian officers. He distributed them to all nine counties of Bessarabia.\nCentral Soldiers' Committee.\nOn June 22, 1917, delegates of the Moldavian soldiers from all Russian Fronts and major reserve units formed a \"Moldavian Central Soldiers' Committee for All of Bessarabia\", with headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u\"&gt;Chi\u015fin\u0103u&lt;/a&gt;. On , the representatives of Moldavian soldiers in the Russian Army units located on the Romanian Front gathered in &lt;a href=\"Ia%C5%9Fi\"&gt;Ia\u015fi&lt;/a&gt;, and proposed a commission of jurists in Chi\u015fin\u0103u who would create a Declaration of national and territorial autonomy of Bessarabia, while respecting the rights of ethnic minorities of Bessarabia. On , the Moldavian soldiers' central committee in &lt;a href=\"Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u\"&gt;Chi\u0219in\u0103u&lt;/a&gt; called for the creation of a council of the province, which would create a \"Proposed Law for National and Territorial Autonomy\". On , the same committee started its own newspaper, called \"Soldatul rom\u00e2n\" and edited by &lt;a href=\"Iorgu%20Tudor\"&gt;Iorgu Tudor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the suggestion of P. Varzar, P. Harea, and lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Gherman%20P%C3%A2ntea\"&gt;Gherman P\u00e2ntea&lt;/a&gt;, leaders of the Central Soldiers Committee, the meeting set up elections for a provincial assembly, Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii. Organizing elections in that situation was difficult due to the security situation, and to the fact that most men between 19 and 48 (if not physically deformed and did not have a profession vital for the supply of the military) were recruited into the Russian army, and stationed on the Romanian front (which saw action until December 1917), in &lt;a href=\"Odessa\"&gt;Odessa&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; ports.\nNational Moldavian Party.\nPrior to 1917, Bessarabian intelligentsia was divided between noblemen, conservatives, democrats, and socialists. &lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Stroescu\"&gt;Vasile Stroescu&lt;/a&gt;, a rich but modest filantop boyar, managed to persuade all major factions to leave their internal fights and join together. In April 1917, the \"National Moldavian Party\" was created, headed by Vasile Stroescu, having among its members &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Gore%20%28historian%29\"&gt;Paul Gore&lt;/a&gt; (a renowned conservative), &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Her%C8%9Ba\"&gt;Vladimir Her\u021ba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pan%20Halippa\"&gt;Pan Halippa&lt;/a&gt; (a renowned socialist), &lt;a href=\"Onisifor%20Ghibu\"&gt;Onisifor Ghibu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Ciugureanu\"&gt;Daniel Ciugureanu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Pelivan\"&gt;Ion Pelivan&lt;/a&gt;. The party, which demanded autonomy, had a newspaper called \"Cuv\u00e2nt moldovenesc\", to which some refugees from &lt;a href=\"Bukovina\"&gt;Bukovina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Transylvania\"&gt;Transylvania&lt;/a&gt; also contributed. The cornerstone of the Moldavian National Party program was to obtain political, administrative, church, school, and economic autonomy for Bessarabia. They did not hesitate to send members of the respective professions to the various congresses held in Bessarabia throughout 1917, and became very influential.\nGhibu and &lt;a href=\"George%20Tofan\"&gt;George Tofan&lt;/a&gt; were part of a group of Transylvanian and Bukovinian intellectuals which arrived in Bessarabia in the wake of the February Revolution to help organize schools in Romanian, to print books and newspapers, and to help the Bessarabians reorganize political and cultural life. Intellectuals from Bukovina, Transylvania, and the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Old%20Kingdom\"&gt;Romanian Old Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; fleeing the war to Bessarabia, helped with the printing of \"Cuv\u00e2nt moldovenesc\", started various language, history, culture, and sciences courses, and set up a People's University () in Chi\u015fin\u0103u.\nRelationship with Ukraine.\nIn the meantime, the Ukrainian National Assembly in &lt;a href=\"Kiev\"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt; claimed Bessarabia as part of &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, and in response, the Moldavians asked for protection from the &lt;a href=\"Petrograd\"&gt;Petrograd&lt;/a&gt; provisional government. On , &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Mimi\"&gt;Constantin Mimi&lt;/a&gt;, the official Commissar of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Provisional%20Government\"&gt;Russian Provisional Government&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Kerenski\"&gt;Alexander Kerenski&lt;/a&gt;) in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, gathered delegates of all major political, national, professional and administrative organizations to a \"delegation\" to protest and reject the pretensions of the \"&lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Central%20Rada\"&gt;Ukrainian Central Rada&lt;/a&gt;\" to annex Bessarabia. Protest notes were sent to the Government in Petrograd and to the \"Ukrainian Rada\" in Kiev. The \"delegation\" also elected a commission tasked with elaboration of an organic statute of the new political and administrative order in Bessarabia. (Halipa, Moraru, pag 144, Nistor, p.\u00a0275)\nOn the same day, similar decisions were taken by the Central Moldavian Soldiers Committee of All Bessarabia (Chi\u015fin\u0103u), and the Committee of Moldavian Soldiers in the Odessa Garrison, which had 19,000 Moldavian soldiers and officers, and the &lt;a href=\"Rumcherod\"&gt;Rumcherod&lt;/a&gt; protested to Kerenski. The Central Soldiers Committee in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, and Rumcherod, a revolutionary committee of soldiers of the Russian Army from the Romanian front, of the Black Sea navy, and of the workers and peasants of the Kherson and Bessarabia gubernias, both asked the Petrograd Government to separate Bessarabia from Russia by agreeing to its autonomy and self-rule in its historic and ethnographic borders. Facing a unanimous protest of Bessarabians, the Ukrainian Rada withdrew its stance on Bessarabia. A revolutionary organization, \"&lt;a href=\"Rumcherod\"&gt;Rumcherod&lt;/a&gt;\", was created in &lt;a href=\"Odessa\"&gt;Odessa&lt;/a&gt;, being a representative body of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russian%20Army\"&gt;Russian Army&lt;/a&gt; on the Romanian front, and having many Moldavians in its ranks. On , the Rumcherod protested against the Ukrainian claims, and demanded from the provisional government the right \"to rule themselves within the historical and ethnic boundaries\".\nElections.\nOn , the Moldavian Central Soldiers Committee of All Bessarabia asked the Supreme Commander, General Sherbachov, to withdraw all Russian Military reserve units from Bessarabia and to increase the number of cohorts from 16 to 50, plus 20 cavalry cohorts, in view of the multiplication of the gangs of Russian deserters.\nOn \u2013, the Soldiers' council proclaimed the autonomy of Bessarabia, and summoned for the election of a representative body (diet), called \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\". The soldiers' councils elected 44 deputies for the assembly, the Peasants' Congress elected 36 deputies, and the remaining 70 deputies were elected by county and communal commissions, as well as by professional and ethnic associations. 70% of the members were Romanians, and the rest were Russians, Bulgarians, Jews, etc.\nMoldavian Central Soldiers and Officers Committee of All Bessarabia decided it could wait no longer, and called the First Soldiers Congress in Chi\u015fin\u0103u on \u2013. 9,000 delegates came to represent the 300,000 Bessarabian soldiers in the Russian Army. The delegates had to come with written delegations from their military units, which were then checked. During the first day, the main theme was the disaster in the security situation in Bessarabia, which was full of gangs practicing pillage, robbery, rapes and killings of the population. At first, these were isolated gangs, but by October, whole regiments turned into such gangs. Two Cossack regiments were stationed in &lt;a href=\"B%C4%83l%C5%A3i%20County%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;B\u0103l\u021bi County&lt;/a&gt;, and a 3,000-strong Russian Army regiment in &lt;a href=\"Orhei%20County%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;Orhei County&lt;/a&gt; had no other occupation but regular raids through these Counties. Among their victims were preeminent personalities, such as the lawyer &lt;a href=\"Simeon%20G.%20Murafa\"&gt;Simeon G. Murafa&lt;/a&gt;, the engineer &lt;a href=\"Hodorogea\"&gt;Hodorogea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Razu\"&gt;Mihai Razu&lt;/a&gt; in August 1917. On , the Congress, \"based on historic, national and revolutionary\" considerations, proclaimed Bessarabia territorially and politically an \"Autonomous Republic\". On 23 October, the Congress discussed the administrative question, and proclaimed the setting of the parliament \"Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii\", composed of 120 delegates, 84 of which should be &lt;a href=\"Moldovans\"&gt;Moldavians&lt;/a&gt;, and 36 ethnic minorities, which should assume the national sovereignty. The Congress demanded that with the setting of Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii, all political committees, except for the professional ones, to be dismantled. The number of members of Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii was later raised to 135, and then to 150, preserving the 70%:30% ratio of Moldavians:minorities. An organization bureau (\"birou de organiza\u021biune\") was elected to implement this decision. 44 delegates were to be elected by the Soldiers Congress, 36 by the Peasants Congress and its County representations, and the remainder by county and local commissions, different professional corporations, associations of the clergy, of the teachers, of the bar, of public functionaries, of workers, so that all the ethnic groups be duly represented.\nTransition of power.\nThe Peasants Congress, which took place in October 1917, voted &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Mimi\"&gt;Mimi&lt;/a&gt; out and &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Incule%C5%A3\"&gt;Ion Incule\u0163&lt;/a&gt; as the new Commissar. This move was planned by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Kerenski\"&gt;Alexander Kerenski&lt;/a&gt;, who sent Incule\u021b, an associate professor at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Petrograd\"&gt;University of Petrograd&lt;/a&gt;, to Bessarabia to take hold of the situation. As soon as the Peasants Congress, which had no legal power, voted, Kerenski formally replaced Mimi with Incule\u021b. When Incule\u021b arrived in Chi\u0219in\u0103u to take power, he faced the quiet opposition of the nobility, therefore he agreed to take the position of deputy commissar to &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Criste\"&gt;Vladimir Criste&lt;/a&gt;. When the republic was proclaimed, Criste stepped down and passed his legal powers to Incule\u021b."
