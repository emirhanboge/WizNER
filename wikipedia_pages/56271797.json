    "text": "The 1946 Wyoming gubernatorial election took place on November 5, 1946. Incumbent Democratic Governor &lt;a href=\"Lester%20C.%20Hunt\"&gt;Lester C. Hunt&lt;/a&gt; ran for re-election to a second term. Former Republican Governor &lt;a href=\"Nels%20H.%20Smith\"&gt;Nels H. Smith&lt;/a&gt;, whom Hunt defeated in &lt;a href=\"1942%20Wyoming%20gubernatorial%20election\"&gt;1942&lt;/a&gt;, announced that he would challenge Hunt for re-election, but he was defeated the Republican primary by State Treasurer Earl Wright. In the general election, even though the Republican Party had a strong performance &lt;a href=\"1946%20United%20States%20elections\"&gt;nationwide&lt;/a&gt;, Wyoming Democrats did well; Hunt defeated Wright by a wider margin than his 1942 victory as Democratic U.S. Senator &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20C.%20O%27Mahoney\"&gt;Joseph C. O'Mahoney&lt;/a&gt; similarly won another term."
