    "text": "Sanford is a city in &lt;a href=\"York%20County%2C%20Maine\"&gt;York County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maine\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The population was 21,982 in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2020 census&lt;/a&gt;, making it the seventh largest municipality in the state. Situated on the &lt;a href=\"Mousam%20River\"&gt;Mousam River&lt;/a&gt;, Sanford includes the village of &lt;a href=\"Springvale%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Springvale&lt;/a&gt;. The city features many lakes in wooded areas which attract campers.\nSanford is part of the &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"South%20Portland%2C%20Maine\"&gt;South Portland&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Biddeford%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Biddeford&lt;/a&gt;, Maine &lt;a href=\"Portland-South%20Portland-Biddeford%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;metropolitan statistical area&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn November 6, 2012, Sanford voters approved a new charter to re-incorporate Sanford as a city and replace the town meeting format with a city council/mayor/strong manager form of government, along with other changes. The new charter took effect on January 1, 2013. Sanford's new charter provides that the first mayor would be appointed from the ranks of Sanford's seven city councilors and serve interim for one-year period. On January 8, 2013, Maura A. Herlihy was appointed as Sanford's first mayor.\nIn 2014, an elected-at-large mayor took office. On November 5, 2013, Thomas Cote was elected as mayor. Beginning in 2016, the mayoral position began being elected at-large every two years during legislative election cycles.\nHistory.\nSanford is in the western portion of a tract of land purchased in 1661 from &lt;a href=\"Abenaki\"&gt;Abenaki&lt;/a&gt; Chief Fluellin by Major William Phillips, an owner of mills in &lt;a href=\"Saco%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Saco&lt;/a&gt;. First called Phillipstown, it was willed in 1696 by Mrs. Phillips to her former husband's son, Peleg Sanford. Settlement was delayed, however, by hostilities during the &lt;a href=\"French%20and%20Indian%20Wars\"&gt;French and Indian Wars&lt;/a&gt;. In 1724, &lt;a href=\"Norridgewock\"&gt;Norridgewock&lt;/a&gt;, a Native &lt;a href=\"fortification\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Kennebec%20River\"&gt;Kennebec River&lt;/a&gt;, was destroyed by a &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"militia\"&gt;militia&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, the region became less dangerous, and Sanford was first settled in 1739. Incorporated a town in 1768, it was named after Peleg Sanford. Until 1794, &lt;a href=\"Alfred%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; was the town's North &lt;a href=\"Parish\"&gt;Parish&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mousam River provided &lt;a href=\"water%20power\"&gt;water power&lt;/a&gt; for industry. In 1745, Capt. Market Morrison built a &lt;a href=\"sawmill\"&gt;sawmill&lt;/a&gt; above &lt;a href=\"Springvale%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Springvale&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, Sanford developed into a &lt;a href=\"textile\"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt; manufacturing center, connected to markets by the &lt;a href=\"Portland%20and%20Rochester%20Railroad\"&gt;Portland and Rochester Railroad&lt;/a&gt;. Factories were built at both Springvale and Sanford villages. Products included &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"woolen\"&gt;woolen&lt;/a&gt; goods, carpets, &lt;a href=\"shoemaking\"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1867, British-born Thomas Goodall established the &lt;a href=\"Goodall%20Mills\"&gt;Goodall Mills&lt;/a&gt; at Sanford, after selling another mill in 1865 at &lt;a href=\"Troy%2C%20New%20Hampshire\"&gt;Troy, New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; which made woolen blankets contoured to fit horses. His factory beside the Mousam River first manufactured &lt;a href=\"carriage\"&gt;carriage&lt;/a&gt; robes and &lt;a href=\"blanket\"&gt;blanket&lt;/a&gt;s. It would expand to make &lt;a href=\"mohair\"&gt;mohair&lt;/a&gt; plush for upholstering &lt;a href=\"railroad\"&gt;railroad&lt;/a&gt; seats, carpets, draperies, auto fabrics, military uniform fabric and Palm Beach fabric for summer suits.\nThe company's textiles were known for brilliant and fast colors and found buyers worldwide. From 1880 to 1910, the &lt;a href=\"mill%20town\"&gt;mill town's&lt;/a&gt; population swelled from 2,700 to over 9,000, some living in houses built by the company and sold to workers at cost. In 1914, the Goodall family built Goodall Park, a 784-seat roofed &lt;a href=\"stadium\"&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt;, now a treasured historic site. They also helped build the library, town hall, hospital, airport, and golf club. A &lt;a href=\"bronze\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt; statue was erected by the citizens of Sanford in 1917 to the memory of Thomas Goodall. His effigy has a place of honor in Central Park. George and Henrietta Goodall's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Marion%20C.%20Goodall\"&gt;Marion C. Goodall&lt;/a&gt; Marland, and her husband William Marland continued the Goodall family philanthropy. A dormitory at Nasson College bears the Marland's name.\nIn 1954, &lt;a href=\"Burlington%20Industries\"&gt;Burlington Mills&lt;/a&gt;, then the nation's largest textile firm, bought &lt;a href=\"Sanford%20Mills\"&gt;Sanford Mills&lt;/a&gt;. After moving the &lt;a href=\"loom\"&gt;loom&lt;/a&gt;s to its &lt;a href=\"Southern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southern&lt;/a&gt; plants, Burlington closed Sanford Mills\u2014leaving 3,600 unemployed and of empty mills. Local business owners began traveling the northeast, enticing employers to move to the area. In November 1955, NBC's &lt;a href=\"Armstrong%20Circle%20Theatre\"&gt;Armstrong Circle Theatre&lt;/a&gt; dramatized Sanford's comeback on television in \u201cThe Town that Refused to Die\u201d, starring &lt;a href=\"Darren%20McGavin\"&gt;Darren McGavin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Robards\"&gt;Jason Robards&lt;/a&gt;. The story was later featured in &lt;a href=\"Life%20Magazine\"&gt;\"LIFE\"&lt;/a&gt; magazine's feature on \"Community Boosters\" on August 5, 1957. It now has diversified industries, including manufacturing and biotech. When the federal government offered money in the 1960s for &lt;a href=\"urban%20renewal\"&gt;urban renewal&lt;/a&gt; to rehabilitate aging or blighted districts, more than thirty Sanford structures were razed. In Springvale, three of four corners were leveled. Nevertheless, much fine &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt; from the town's prosperous mill era survived.\nSanford was the home of Belle Ashton Leavitt, the third woman attorney admitted to the Maine Bar Association. Leavitt was admitted to the Bar in 1900. Leavitt operated in partnership with attorney Fred J. Allen, her brother-in-law (Allen was married to Belle's sister Ida Leavitt), and member of the &lt;a href=\"Maine%20Legislature\"&gt;Maine Legislature&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town gained national notoriety in 1984, when Scott Waterhouse, then age 18, strangled 12-year-old Gycelle Cote. Rumors of &lt;a href=\"Satanism\"&gt;Satanism&lt;/a&gt; surrounded the case, and some of Waterhouse's personal belongings were deemed to be occult in nature. These included a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Satanic%20Bible\"&gt;The Satanic Bible&lt;/a&gt;\" and a notebook carrying Satanic drawings and poetry. The furor culminated in several tabloid stories, national television coverage, and at least one headline referring to the town as \"Terrortown!\".\nThe town again gained national notoriety on November 9, 2009, when the Amber Alert system was first used in the state for 2-year-old Hailey Traynham, abducted by her father.\nIn 2003, Maine voters rejected a proposal to build a $650 million &lt;a href=\"casino\"&gt;casino&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"South%20Sanford%2C%20Maine\"&gt;South Sanford&lt;/a&gt;. The development, ostensibly owned by the &lt;a href=\"Penobscot%20people\"&gt;Penobscot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Passamaquoddy\"&gt;Passamaquoddy&lt;/a&gt; nations, would have included 4,000 &lt;a href=\"slot%20machine\"&gt;slot machine&lt;/a&gt;s, 180 gaming tables, a hotel, a &lt;a href=\"convention%20center\"&gt;convention center&lt;/a&gt; and an 18-hole &lt;a href=\"golf%20course\"&gt;golf course&lt;/a&gt;. Proponents argued it would add 4,700 permanent jobs and direct 25% of its revenue to the state. Detractors predicted higher crime, traffic and an erosion of Maine's quality of life.\nOn June 23, 2017, the largest mill fire Sanford firefighters have ever battled erupted. The flaming five-story back building of the former Stenton Trust Mill complex at 13 River Street brought more than 100 firefighters from 20 communities to battle the blaze. The complex, which was built in 1922 as a &lt;a href=\"textile%20mill\"&gt;textile mill&lt;/a&gt;, includes two five-story brick and concrete buildings and a one-story connecting structure. Two days later, three boys from Sanford, two 13-year-olds and a 12-year-old, were charged with felony arson in connection with the fire. They pleaded guilty to criminal mischief and were placed on probation for a year.\nGeography.\nSanford is located at (43.439925, -70.773304).\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and is water. Located near &lt;a href=\"foothill\"&gt;foothill&lt;/a&gt;s, Sanford is drained by the Mousam River. Mt. Hope, elevation 680 feet (207 m) above sea level, is the city's highest point. The lowest elevation, which is approximately 140 feet (42.7 m) above sea level, is on the Mousam River at Old Falls Pond as it flows into Kennebunk.\nSanford borders the towns of &lt;a href=\"Shapleigh\"&gt;Shapleigh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acton%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Acton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alfred%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kennebunk%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Kennebunk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wells%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Wells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Berwick%2C%20Maine\"&gt;North Berwick&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lebanon%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nThe climate is &lt;a href=\"humid%20continental\"&gt;humid continental&lt;/a&gt;, similar to nearby towns such as Concord, New Hampshire.
