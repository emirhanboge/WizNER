    "text": "The Red Party (, or ) was a political group that contested elections in the &lt;a href=\"Canada%20East\"&gt;Eastern section&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Province of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. It was formed around 1847 by radical &lt;a href=\"French-Canadian\"&gt;French-Canadian&lt;/a&gt;s inspired by the ideas of &lt;a href=\"Louis-Joseph%20Papineau\"&gt;Louis-Joseph Papineau&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Institut%20canadien%20de%20Montr%C3%A9al\"&gt;Institut canadien de Montr\u00e9al&lt;/a&gt;\", and the reformist movement led by the &lt;a href=\"Parti%20patriote\"&gt;Parti patriote&lt;/a&gt; of the 1830s.\nThe Red Party did not experience electoral success in the same manner as the &lt;a href=\"Parti%20bleu\"&gt;Blue Party&lt;/a&gt;, their electoral rivals in Canada East. Because of their anti-clerical beliefs, the Red Party was condemned by the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, contributing to their lack of electoral success. The party did form government as part of a coalition with the &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Grits\"&gt;Clear Grits&lt;/a&gt; and Liberals from Canada West on some occasions before confederation, but never held a majority in their section of the province. After &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Confederation\"&gt;confederation&lt;/a&gt;, the party was dissolved, with members forming the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; at the federal level, and the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Quebec\"&gt;Liberal Party of Quebec&lt;/a&gt; at the provincial level.\nHistory.\nThe party was a successor to the &lt;a href=\"Parti%20patriote\"&gt;Parti patriote&lt;/a&gt;, a radical political movement in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Canada\"&gt;Lower Canada&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the &lt;a href=\"rebellions%20of%201837%E2%80%931838\"&gt;rebellions of 1837\u20131838&lt;/a&gt;. The reformist rouges did not believe that the 1840 &lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20Union%20%281840%29\"&gt;Act of Union&lt;/a&gt; had truly granted a &lt;a href=\"responsible%20government\"&gt;responsible government&lt;/a&gt; to former Upper and Lower Canada. They advocated important &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt; reforms, &lt;a href=\"republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;anism, and secularism (separation of the state and the church). They were perceived as &lt;a href=\"anti-clericalism\"&gt;anti-clerical&lt;/a&gt; and radical by their political adversaries. Some of its members desired the abolition of the semi-&lt;a href=\"feudal\"&gt;feudal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Seigneurial%20system%20of%20New%20France\"&gt;seigneurial system&lt;/a&gt; of land ownership, although Papineau was himself a seigneur and a vocal defender of the traditional system, which he wanted reformed, not abolished.\nThe elected rouges typically allied with the &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Grits\"&gt;Clear Grits&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Province%20of%20Canada\"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Province of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. The party primarily sat in opposition to the Liberal-Conservative-Bleu government that governed the province for most of the period between the fall of the reform movement and confederation. However, the rouges did form government with the Clear Grits once, after the fall of the Macdonald-Cartier ministry on a vote of non-confidence. This resulted in the shortest-lived government in Canadian history, falling four days after it was called by the Governor-General. After Confederation, its more moderate members (notably including Sir &lt;a href=\"Wilfrid%20Laurier\"&gt;Wilfrid Laurier&lt;/a&gt;, who would become Canada's first francophone Prime Minister) formed what became the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with their Upper Canadian Clear Grit allies.\nIdeology.\nThe Red Party opposed the union of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Canada\"&gt;Upper Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Canada\"&gt;Lower Canada&lt;/a&gt; into the United &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Province of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and demanded its termination. When talks for &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20confederation\"&gt;Canadian confederation&lt;/a&gt; began, its members either opposed the idea, or suggested a decentralized confederation. Some elements of the party advocated for full sovereignty, or joining with the United States, for the French-speaking part of Canada. They were opposed to the &lt;a href=\"ultramontane\"&gt;ultramontane&lt;/a&gt; politics of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clergy\"&gt;clergy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Parti%20bleu\"&gt;Parti bleu&lt;/a&gt;.\nManifestos.\nThe Red Party published the following manifestos:"
