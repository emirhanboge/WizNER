Walsall finished 14th in the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1961%E2%80%9362%20Football%20League\"&gt;1961\u201362&lt;/a&gt;, under the stewardship of &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Moore%20%28footballer%20born%201913%29\"&gt;Bill Moore&lt;/a&gt;. He remained the first choice keeper at &lt;a href=\"Fellows%20Park\"&gt;Fellows Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1962%E2%80%9363%20Football%20League\"&gt;1962\u201363&lt;/a&gt;, as the \"Saddlers\" were relegated into the &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt;. He moved on to league rivals &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Shrewsbury Town&lt;/a&gt;, who finished mid-table in &lt;a href=\"1963%E2%80%9364%20Football%20League\"&gt;1963\u201364&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1964%E2%80%9365%20Football%20League\"&gt;1964\u201365&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1965%E2%80%9366%20Football%20League\"&gt;1965\u201366&lt;/a&gt;, before missing out on promotion by four places and three points in &lt;a href=\"1966%E2%80%9367%20Football%20League\"&gt;1966\u201367&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Shrews\" finished third in &lt;a href=\"1967%E2%80%9368%20Football%20League\"&gt;1967\u201368&lt;/a&gt;, missing out on promotion by a single point. He was the first choice stopper for &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Rowley\"&gt;Arthur Rowley&lt;/a&gt;'s side throughout his five years at &lt;a href=\"Gay%20Meadow\"&gt;Gay Meadow&lt;/a&gt;.\nWolves and Bolton.\nBoswell signed with &lt;a href=\"Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Wolverhampton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; in 1968, but played just ten &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; games in &lt;a href=\"1968%E2%80%9369%20Football%20League\"&gt;1968\u201369&lt;/a&gt;, including a 6\u20130 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Molineux%20Stadium\"&gt;Molineux&lt;/a&gt;. He was sold on to &lt;a href=\"Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bolton Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the campaign, who were competing in the Second Division under the stewardship of &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Lofthouse\"&gt;Nat Lofthouse&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Trotters\" finished 16th in &lt;a href=\"1969%E2%80%9370%20Football%20League\"&gt;1969\u201370&lt;/a&gt;, before suffering relegation in last place in &lt;a href=\"1970%E2%80%9371%20Football%20League\"&gt;1970\u201371&lt;/a&gt;. In his last season at &lt;a href=\"Burnden%20Park\"&gt;Burnden Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1971%E2%80%9372%20Football%20League\"&gt;1971\u201372&lt;/a&gt;, Bolton finished seventh in the Third Division.\nPort Vale.\nHe moved to &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Lee%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Gordon Lee&lt;/a&gt;'s Third Division &lt;a href=\"Port%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Port Vale&lt;/a&gt; in July 1972 and kept a &lt;a href=\"clean%20sheet\"&gt;clean sheet&lt;/a&gt; on his debut in a draw with &lt;a href=\"Rochdale%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Rochdale&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Spotland%20Stadium\"&gt;Spotland&lt;/a&gt; on 12 August that year. He spent two seasons of regular football with the club, leaving some unpleasant memories for many Vale fans: conceding seven goals to &lt;a href=\"Rotherham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Rotherham United&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Millmoor\"&gt;Millmoor&lt;/a&gt;, he was sent off for fighting during a 1\u20130 win at &lt;a href=\"Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Swansea Town&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Vetch%20Field\"&gt;Vetch Field&lt;/a&gt;, and managed to palm the ball into his own net in a 1\u20131 draw with former club Walsall at &lt;a href=\"Vale%20Park\"&gt;Vale Park&lt;/a&gt;. He was favoured ahead of &lt;a href=\"Reg%20Edwards%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201953%29\"&gt;Reg Edwards&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1972%E2%80%9373%20Port%20Vale%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1972\u201373&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1973%E2%80%9374%20Port%20Vale%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1973\u201374&lt;/a&gt;. He was given a free transfer in May 1974 by new manager &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Sproson\"&gt;Roy Sproson&lt;/a&gt;, and moved on to non-league side &lt;a href=\"Oswestry%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Oswestry Town&lt;/a&gt;, where he also served as manager in the first half of the &lt;a href=\"1976%E2%80%9377%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;1976\u201377&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt; Division One North season.\nStyle of play.\nBoswell was a &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt; ahead of his time, as he was castigated for his teammates for warming up outside the goal area before games, which became common practice after his retirement. He also bought his own kit and wore gloves, which few other goalkeepers did at the time.\nPersonal and later life.\nAfter retiring from football, he ran a &lt;a href=\"newsagent%27s%20shop\"&gt;newsagent's shop&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury\"&gt;Shrewsbury&lt;/a&gt; and found success in the &lt;a href=\"pool%20table\"&gt;pool table&lt;/a&gt; industry. He married Rosalind and had twin daughters. Another daughter, Faye Turney, was one of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Iranian%20arrest%20of%20Royal%20Navy%20personnel\"&gt;15 British naval personnel seized by Iran in 2007&lt;/a&gt;. His death was reported on 24 August 2017.\nStatistics.\nSource:"
