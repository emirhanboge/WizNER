    "text": "France was present at the Eurovision Song Contest 1981, held in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore Eurovision.\n\"Concours de la Chanson Fran\u00e7aise pour l'Eurovision 1981\".\nThe final was held on 8 March 1981 at the &lt;a href=\"TF1\"&gt;TF1&lt;/a&gt; Studios in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, and was hosted by television hostess &lt;a href=\"Fabienne%20%C3%89gal\"&gt;Fabienne \u00c9gal&lt;/a&gt;. Six songs made it to the national final after two semi-final heats. The winner was decided by a random sampling of 1,086 television viewers who were contacted by TF1 and asked which song was their favorite.\nThe winning entry was \"&lt;a href=\"Humanahum\"&gt;Humanahum&lt;/a&gt;,\" performed by Jean Gabilou and composed by &lt;a href=\"Jean-Paul%20Cara\"&gt;Jean-Paul Cara&lt;/a&gt; with lyrics by Joe Gracy. Cara and Gracy also penned the 1977 Contest winner \"&lt;a href=\"L%27oiseau%20et%20l%27enfant\"&gt;L'oiseau et l'enfant&lt;/a&gt;\". Gabilou, a Tahitian singer, was the first ever to represent France from one of its &lt;a href=\"Overseas%20departments%20and%20territories%20of%20France\"&gt;overseas territories&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe order of the songs presented on the night of the Contest vary from other published material.\nAt Eurovision.\nJean Gabilou performed ninth on the night of the contest, following &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and preceding &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. At the close of the voting the song had received 125 points, placing 3rd in a field of 20 competing countries. Despite finishing in the top three, TF1's head of entertainment programming, Pierre Bouteiller, famously opted out of the &lt;a href=\"Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%201982\"&gt;1982 Contest&lt;/a&gt;, referring to Eurovision as \"a monument to inanity [sometimes translated as \"drivel\"].\" France would return to the fold in &lt;a href=\"Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%201983\"&gt;1983&lt;/a&gt;."
