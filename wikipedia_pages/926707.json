    "text": "The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet () was a body of &lt;a href=\"Power%20%28social%20and%20political%29\"&gt;state power&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&lt;/a&gt; (USSR). The presidium was elected by joint session of both houses of the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Supreme Soviet&lt;/a&gt; to act on its behalf while the Supreme Soviet was not &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20session\"&gt;in session&lt;/a&gt;. By the &lt;a href=\"1936%20Constitution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;1936&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1977%20Constitution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;1977 Soviet Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet served as the &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20state%23Multiple%20or%20collective%20heads%20of%20state\"&gt;collective head of state&lt;/a&gt; of the USSR. In all its activities, the Presidium was accountable to the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Supreme Soviet of the USSR&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeside the all-Union body there also were in all &lt;a href=\"Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;union republic&lt;/a&gt;s (eg: &lt;a href=\"Presidium%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20the%20Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Presidium&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Supreme Soviet&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Russian SFSR&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and other regions including &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republics\"&gt;autonomous republics&lt;/a&gt;. Structure and functions of the presidiums in these republics were virtually identical.\nDuring discussions in regards to adaptation of the 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union, on proposition to elect chairperson of the Presidium in a campaign involving the whole population of the country as in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; the President, &lt;a href=\"Stalin\"&gt;Stalin&lt;/a&gt; argued: \"In the system of our Constitution, in the USSR (Soviet Union) should not be a president in one person elected by whole population equally with the Supreme Soviet and able to oppose to the Supreme Soviet. The experience of history shows that such a construction of the supreme organs is the most democratic, guaranteeing the country from undesirable accidents.\"\nElection.\nThe Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was elected by the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Supreme Soviet of the USSR&lt;/a&gt; at a joint session of both chambers at the first session of each after &lt;a href=\"convocation\"&gt;convocation&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20%28legislator%29\"&gt;deputies&lt;/a&gt; of the Presidium were appointed for the duration of the term of office of the Supreme Soviet. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the &lt;a href=\"USSR\"&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt; consisted of a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;chairman&lt;/a&gt;, a first vice-chairman (since 1977), his 15 deputies (one from each &lt;a href=\"Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;), a secretary, and 20 members. The Presidium was accountable to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for all its activities.\nFrom 1938 to 1989, the chairman of the Presidium was reckoned as the USSR/Soviet Union's \"de jure\" head of state, and was sometimes referred to as the \"President of the USSR/Soviet Union\" in non-Soviet sources.\nThe building of the Presidium.\nIts building, situated inside the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Kremlin\"&gt;Moscow Kremlin&lt;/a&gt;, was appropriately named the &lt;a href=\"Kremlin%20Presidium\"&gt;Kremlin Presidium&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstitutional powers.\nAt inception.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"1936%20Constitution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;1936 Constitution of the USSR&lt;/a&gt;, as in force as enacted originally (and thus, at the establishment of the Presidium), the basic powers of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR were:\nThe presidium also dealt with questions regarding the acquisition of the Soviet &lt;a href=\"citizenship\"&gt;citizenship&lt;/a&gt;, its forfeiting or voluntary rejection.\nWhen the Supreme Soviet was not in session, the Presidium carried out the Supreme Soviet's ordinary functions. It was also empowered to issue decrees in lieu of law, which were to be submitted to the Supreme Soviet at its next session. If such decrees were not ratified by the Supreme Soviet, they were considered revoked. In practice, the Supreme Soviet's infrequent sessions (it usually sat for only one week per year) and the principles of &lt;a href=\"democratic%20centralism\"&gt;democratic centralism&lt;/a&gt; meant that Presidium decrees \"de facto\" had the force of law. It was not unheard of for the &lt;a href=\"Politburo%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;CPSU Politburo&lt;/a&gt; to bypass the full Supreme Soviet and enact major laws as Presidium decrees. While the full Supreme Soviet's power of veto was almost never exercised in practice, it was not unheard of for the Politburo to enact Presidium decrees into law without even the formality of submitting them to the Supreme Soviet for ratification.\nAt abolition.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"1977%20Constitution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;1977 Constitution of the USSR&lt;/a&gt;, as in force at the union's dissolution (and thus, at the abolition of the Presidium), the basic powers of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR were:\nBy then, most of the Presidium's former powers were reassigned to the whole Supreme Soviet and to the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;President of the USSR&lt;/a&gt;."
