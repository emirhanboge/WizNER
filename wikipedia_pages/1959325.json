    "text": "William Berry Hartsfield Sr. (March 1, 1890 \u2013 February 22, 1971), was an American &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt; who served as the 49th and 51st &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Atlanta\"&gt;Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. His tenure extended from 1937 to 1941 and again from 1942 to 1962, making him the longest-serving mayor of his native &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly career.\nHartsfield entered politics in 1922 by winning a city &lt;a href=\"alderman\"&gt;alderman&lt;/a&gt; seat. He served two terms in the &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Georgia House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; during the 1930s.\nMayor of Atlanta.\nWilliam B. Hartsfield was first elected &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20of%20Atlanta\"&gt;Mayor of Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; in January 1937. Upon taking office, the city was $3 million in debt, due to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;. Hartsfield quickly turned around the city's finances, but lost re-election in 1940. The man who defeated Hartsfield served just one year as mayor, before being drafted into the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;. Hartsfield won election in 1941, and remained in office until 1961.\nIn an obituary for him, &lt;a href=\"the%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; credited Hartsfield with developing Atlanta into a national aviation center. He has also been credited for ensuring a good water supply with the completion of the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Lanier\"&gt;Buford Dam&lt;/a&gt;.\nHartsfield received an honorary degree in Doctor of Laws from &lt;a href=\"Oglethorpe%20University\"&gt;Oglethorpe University&lt;/a&gt; in 1961.\nRace.\nThe New York Times called Hartsfield a \"racial moderate\", highlighting his slogan \"Atlanta is a city too busy to hate\", which he often repeated during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20rights%20movement\"&gt;civil rights&lt;/a&gt; struggles of the 1950s. In 1957, he won election to his last term as mayor by defeating the staunch segregationist and future &lt;a href=\"governor%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lester%20Maddox\"&gt;Lester Maddox&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout much of the 1940s, Hartsfield pushed for Atlanta to &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20annexation\"&gt;annex&lt;/a&gt; a number of predominantly &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt;s, fearing that Atlanta's \"&lt;a href=\"Negro\"&gt;Negro&lt;/a&gt; population is growing by leaps and bounds\", resulting in the loss of \"white territory inside Atlanta\", and hoped that the inclusion of these suburbs would prevent the city's &lt;a href=\"black\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; population from becoming a \"potent political force in Atlanta\". While residents of these suburbs rejected annexation in a 1947 referendum, legislation was passed which annexed these communities in 1952, tripling Atlanta's area, and adding 100,000 new residents to the city.\nLegacy.\n&lt;a href=\"Willie%20B.\"&gt;Willie B.&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"gorilla\"&gt;gorilla&lt;/a&gt; that became a popular attraction at &lt;a href=\"Zoo%20Atlanta\"&gt;Zoo Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; for decades, was named for Hartsfield.\n&lt;a href=\"Hartsfield%E2%80%93Jackson%20Atlanta%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport&lt;/a&gt; is named in Hartsfield's honor as well as a later mayor, &lt;a href=\"Maynard%20Jackson\"&gt;Maynard Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, who led the modernization of the airport in the 1970s."
