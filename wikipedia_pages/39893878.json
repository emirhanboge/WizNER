    "text": "The Walloon Front for the Unity and Freedom of Wallonia (, FW) was a political party in &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe FW was established by former &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Belgian Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; member Robert Moreau on 19 January 1964. In the &lt;a href=\"1965%20Belgian%20general%20election\"&gt;1965 general elections&lt;/a&gt; the party received 0.5% of the vote and won a single seat in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Representatives%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Chamber of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. On 26 June 1965 it merged with the &lt;a href=\"Walloon%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Walloon Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt;, the Walloon Democratic Rally and the Wallon Democratic Front to form the Walloon Party, the forerunner to the &lt;a href=\"Walloon%20Rally\"&gt;Walloon Rally&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2013 a new Walloon Front party was established to participate in the 2014 elections."
