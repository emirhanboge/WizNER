    "text": "Andriy Oleksandrovych Dykan (; born 16 July 1977) is a retired &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt; who last played for &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n side &lt;a href=\"FC%20Krasnodar\"&gt;FC Krasnodar&lt;/a&gt;. His previous clubs include &lt;a href=\"FC%20Terek%20Grozny\"&gt;Terek Grozny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Spartak%20Moscow\"&gt;Spartak Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. Dykan was also a full &lt;a href=\"Ukraine%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; international, winning 8 caps for his country.\nHe also holds Russian citizenship which he obtained in 2000 in &lt;a href=\"Khabarovsk\"&gt;Khabarovsk&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Kharkiv\"&gt;Kharkiv&lt;/a&gt;, Andriy Dykan played in Ukrainian lower league clubs, until he joined the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20First%20Division\"&gt;Russian First Division&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"FC%20SKA-Energiya%20Khabarovsk\"&gt;SKA-Energiya Khabarovsk&lt;/a&gt; in 1999. He became a first-choice goalkeeper and also regularly took penalties, scoring 9 goals in his 5 years with the club. Young and gifted goalkeeper was noticed by a number of top flight Russian clubs, but deal offers from &lt;a href=\"Lokomotiv%20Moscow\"&gt;Lokomotiv Moscow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rubin%20Kazan\"&gt;Rubin Kazan&lt;/a&gt; were rejected due to various reasons.\nIn 2004, Dykan signed for &lt;a href=\"FC%20Kuban%20Krasnodar\"&gt;FC Kuban Krasnodar&lt;/a&gt;, where he also became a regular starter, but following an illness, lost his first-team place to &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Gabulov\"&gt;Vladimir Gabulov&lt;/a&gt;. Dykan then moved back to Ukraine and joined &lt;a href=\"FC%20Tavriya%20Simferopol\"&gt;FC Tavriya Simferopol&lt;/a&gt; in January 2008.\nIn January 2009, he left Tavriya on a free transfer and moved to &lt;a href=\"FC%20Terek%20Grozny\"&gt;FC Terek Grozny&lt;/a&gt;. His outstanding performances in the first half of 2010 season earned him an offer from Russian giants &lt;a href=\"FC%20Spartak%20Moscow\"&gt;FC Spartak Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. In August 2010, Dykan signed a contract with the &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; club. In his only second competitive game for Spartak, an &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; away match against &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20de%20Marseille\"&gt;Olympique de Marseille&lt;/a&gt; on 15 September 2010, Dykan became the hero of the hour, keeping the clean sheet and making many crucial saves, as Spartak went on to win the game 1\u20130. He maintained steady performances in &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;, keeping two clean sheets against &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Ajax\"&gt;AFC Ajax&lt;/a&gt; in the round of sixteen and thus helping Spartak to defeat Dutch team 4-0 on aggregate. Dykan's form in &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Russian Premier League&lt;/a&gt; was also solid, meaning that Spartak's goalkeeper troubles that had emerged after the departure of &lt;a href=\"Stipe%20Pletikosa\"&gt;Stipe Pletikosa&lt;/a&gt;, were finally over. As of spring 2012, Dykan remains an undoubted number one goalkeeper of Spartak, and his ability to make spectacular saves as well as virtual absence of blunders have earned him much respect from the fans.\nAfter recovering from injury, Dykan was forced to settle for a place on the bench due to the outstanding performances of &lt;a href=\"Sergei%20Pesyakov\"&gt;Sergei Pesyakov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Artyom%20Rebrov\"&gt;Artyom Rebrov&lt;/a&gt;, previously Spartak's second and third-choice keepers, respectively. However, he then returned to being Spartak's first choice 'keeper, putting in an impressive performance against city rivals &lt;a href=\"PFC%20CSKA%20Moscow\"&gt;CSKA&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next season, he didn't play regularly and at one point became the fourth-choice goalkeeper. Towards the end of the season, however, Dykan was reinstated to the team, as Spartak claimed a disappointing sixth-place finish in the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Russian Premier League&lt;/a&gt;. Dykan ended his career after two seasons at &lt;a href=\"FC%20Krasnodar\"&gt;Krasnodar&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nDykan made his debut for the &lt;a href=\"Ukraine%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Ukraine national football team&lt;/a&gt; in a friendly match against &lt;a href=\"Norway%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; on 2 June 2010, at the age of 32. He continued making regular appearances for the national team, and as Ukraine's home &lt;a href=\"Euro-2012\"&gt;European Championship&lt;/a&gt; approached, Dykan, despite his belated debut, appeared to be the most probable choice for Ukraine's starting goalkeeper at the tournament. Alongside his promising performances for the national team, his position was also strengthened by the injury of veteran &lt;a href=\"Oleksandr%20Shovkovskyi\"&gt;Oleksandr Shovkovskyi&lt;/a&gt; and the 2-year ban of young prospect &lt;a href=\"Oleksandr%20Rybka\"&gt;Oleksandr Rybka&lt;/a&gt;. However, on 31 March 2012, while playing for Spartak against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Zenit&lt;/a&gt;, he suffered a collision with Zenit's &lt;a href=\"Aleksandr%20Kerzhakov\"&gt;Aleksandr Kerzhakov&lt;/a&gt; and was injured. Dykan was diagnosed with multiple facial bones fractures, craniocerebral trauma and brain concussion. He went on to miss the final tournament, and failed to make an appearance for Ukraine again.\nHonours.\nIndividual:\nwith \"Spartak Moscow\":"
