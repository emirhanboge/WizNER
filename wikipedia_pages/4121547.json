    "text": "Lev Konstantinovich Knipper (&lt;a href=\"Russian%20language\"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;: \u041b\u0435\u0432 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u043d\u0438\u043f\u043f\u0435\u0440; \u2013 30 July 1974) was a &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n composer of partial German descent and an active &lt;a href=\"OGPU\"&gt;OGPU&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"NKVD\"&gt;NKVD&lt;/a&gt; agent.\nLife and career.\nLev Knipper was born in &lt;a href=\"Tiflis\"&gt;Tiflis&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"railway%20engineering\"&gt;railway engineer&lt;/a&gt; Konstantin Leonardovich Knipper and Elena-Luiza Yul\u2019evna Rid. Shortly after his birth, the family relocated to &lt;a href=\"Tsarskoye%20Selo\"&gt;Tsarskoye Selo&lt;/a&gt;, then to &lt;a href=\"Ekaterinoslav\"&gt;Ekaterinoslav&lt;/a&gt; in 1910, and then &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; in 1913. He was greatly influenced by his father's sister, the actress &lt;a href=\"Olga%20Knipper\"&gt;Olga Knipper&lt;/a&gt; (wife of the playwright &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Chekhov\"&gt;Anton Chekhov&lt;/a&gt;), who encouraged his musical interests. He learned to play &lt;a href=\"clarinet\"&gt;clarinet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"double%20bass\"&gt;double bass&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"brass%20instrument\"&gt;brass instrument&lt;/a&gt;s, and taught himself to play &lt;a href=\"piano\"&gt;piano&lt;/a&gt; out of a book.\nKnipper enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"White%20Army\"&gt;White Army&lt;/a&gt; in 1916. Following the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Russian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; of 1917, he became stranded in &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, though was eventually able to reunite with his aunt &lt;a href=\"Olga%20Knipper\"&gt;Olga&lt;/a&gt;, who was touring abroad. Upon his return to &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic\"&gt;Soviet Russia&lt;/a&gt; in 1922, he was repeatedly interviewed and ultimately recruited by the &lt;a href=\"OGPU\"&gt;OGPU&lt;/a&gt; foreign department. At their behest, Knipper travelled to &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; in 1922-23, where he made the acquaintance of composers &lt;a href=\"Alois%20H%C3%A1ba\"&gt;Alois H\u00e1ba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Philipp%20Jarnach\"&gt;Philipp Jarnach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Hindemith\"&gt;Paul Hindemith&lt;/a&gt;. Hindemith's music in particular had a strong influence on Knipper's own compositional language.\nThrough the connections of his aunt, Knipper made the acquaintance of &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Gnesina\"&gt;Elena Gnesina&lt;/a&gt;, who hired him as building administrator at the &lt;a href=\"Gnessin%20Music%20School\"&gt;Gnessin Music School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. Though Knipper was too old to be officially admitted as a student, he was nonetheless able to study with &lt;a href=\"Reinhold%20Gli%C3%A8re\"&gt;Reinhold Gli\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Zhilyayev%20%28musicologist%29\"&gt;Nikolai Zhilyayev&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote his first catalogued composition, the orchestral suite \"\u0421\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0438\u043f\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u043e\u0436\u043a\u0430 (Tales of a Plaster God)\", op. 1, in 1923, a work musicologist &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Sitsky\"&gt;Larry Sitsky&lt;/a&gt; characterizes as \"harsh and chiseled,\" and somewhat &lt;a href=\"grotesque\"&gt;grotesque&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by sculptures of the &lt;a href=\"Buddha\"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pavel%20Tchelitchew\"&gt;Pavel Tchelitchew&lt;/a&gt;, the six-movement suite premiered on 8 March 1925 and was well-received by audiences and critics. Fellow composer &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Sabaneyev\"&gt;Leonid Sabaneyev&lt;/a&gt; approached Knipper at the premiere and asked for a copy of the score. In 1929, Knipper was invited by &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Nemirovich-Danchenko\"&gt;Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko&lt;/a&gt; to work as a consultant at the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Art%20Theatre\"&gt;Moscow Art Theatre&lt;/a&gt;. This led to the creation of Knipper's most significant work of this early period, his 1930 &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; \"\u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440 (The North Wind)\", op. 25, based on the play by &lt;a href=\"Vladimir%20Kirshon\"&gt;Vladimir Kirshon&lt;/a&gt;. Musicologist &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Abraham\"&gt;Gerald Abraham&lt;/a&gt; describes the opera as \"harmonically sophisticated, dry, [and] more than a little Hindemithian.\" The opera is also noted for its defiance of typical operatic conventions. \"The North Wind\" received a total of seventy-eight performances, mostly in Moscow, but following harsh criticism from the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Association%20of%20Proletarian%20Musicians\"&gt;Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians&lt;/a&gt; it was not staged again until 1974.\nSeemingly in response to criticism of his &lt;a href=\"modernism%20%28music%29\"&gt;modernist&lt;/a&gt; early works, Knipper resigned his post as technical secretary to the &lt;a href=\"Association%20for%20Contemporary%20Music\"&gt;Association for Contemporary Music&lt;/a&gt; (two years before it was officially disbanded) and abruptly shifted his style towards one more in line with the principals of &lt;a href=\"socialist%20realism\"&gt;socialist realism&lt;/a&gt;. In 1930-1931, he travelled to Central Asia to &lt;a href=\"ethnomusicology\"&gt;study the region's folk music&lt;/a&gt;. The music of &lt;a href=\"Tajikistan\"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt; was apparently a source of great inspiration for him: his list of works reveals eight explicitly Tajik-inspired compositions. The majority of Knipper's works from this period are musically conservative and patriotic and militaristic in tone, most notably his \"song-symphonies\" (3, 4 and 6). The most notable of these is his &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnJxF_YL8jSk\"&gt;Fourth Symphony&lt;/a&gt;, \"\u041f\u043e\u044d\u043c\u0430 \u043e \u0431\u043e\u0439\u0446\u0435-\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435 (Poem of the &lt;a href=\"Komsomol\"&gt;Komsomol&lt;/a&gt; Fighter),\" op. 41 (1934), with lyrics by &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Gusev\"&gt;Victor Gusev&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Kliment%20Voroshilov\"&gt;Kliment Voroshilov&lt;/a&gt;. The central theme of the symphony, the song \"&lt;a href=\"Polyushko%20Pole\"&gt;\u041f\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0448\u043a\u043e-\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435&lt;/a&gt;\", has become Knipper's most famous work as one of the marching songs of the &lt;a href=\"Alexandrov%20Ensemble\"&gt;Red Army Choir&lt;/a&gt;. Though in line with Soviet political ideals, these song-symphonies were met with criticism by some of Knipper's fellow composers: &lt;a href=\"Dmitri%20Shostakovich\"&gt;Dmitri Shostakovich&lt;/a&gt;, for one, lambasted Knipper's Third Symphony (1932) for its \"primitiveness\" at a meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Soviet%20Composers\"&gt;Union of Soviet Composers&lt;/a&gt; in 1935 (fortunately for Shostakovich, this criticism did not deter Knipper from coming to his defense following the famous public denunciation of Shostakovich's opera \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Macbeth%20of%20the%20Mtsensk%20District%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1936). &lt;a href=\"Dmitri%20Kabalevsky\"&gt;Dmitri Kabalevsky&lt;/a&gt; pointed out the shortcomings of Knipper's approach to combining mass-songs and the surrounding symphonic material. In his Sixth Symphony, op. 47 (1936), Knipper apparently veered too close to his earlier style and was publicly rebuked for it; his Seventh Symphony \"Military\" (1938) returned to an ideologically safer style.\nKnipper continued to compose during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, though much of his time was devoted to extensive travel for the &lt;a href=\"NKVD\"&gt;NKVD&lt;/a&gt;, which he continued to serve until 1949. According to secret intelligence documents released in 2002, Knipper and his wife were to play a key role if the &lt;a href=\"Nazism\"&gt;Nazis&lt;/a&gt; should capture Moscow: Under the elaborate plan, ballerinas and circus acrobats were armed with grenades and pistols and ordered to assassinate German generals if they attempted to organize concerts and other celebrations upon taking the city. Knipper was personally charged with the responsibility of killing &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt; if he got the opportunity, an opportunity the NKVD suspected might arise due to Knipper's sister, &lt;a href=\"Olga%20Chekhova\"&gt;Olga&lt;/a&gt;, having social connections with high-ranking Nazis including &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring\"&gt;Hermann G\u00f6ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnipper was prolific. He wrote 5 operas (including one on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Little%20Prince\"&gt;The Little Prince&lt;/a&gt;\"), 20 symphonies, ballets, pieces for piano and other film musics.\nThe primary publishers of Knipper's works are &lt;a href=\"P.%20Jurgenson\"&gt;Muzyka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Publishing%20houses%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Kompozitor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Le%20Chant%20du%20Monde\"&gt;Le Chant du Monde&lt;/a&gt;. Most of his published compositions are currently out of print, and the majority of his output has yet to be published."
