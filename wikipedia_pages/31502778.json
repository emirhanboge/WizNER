    "text": "William Brownell Golden (born October 9, 1948 in &lt;a href=\"Boston%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;) is an American &lt;a href=\"Lawyer\"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt; who represented the &lt;a href=\"Norfolk%20County%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Norfolk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plymouth%20County%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Plymouth&lt;/a&gt; district in the &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Senate\"&gt;Massachusetts Senate&lt;/a&gt; from 1985\u20131991. He was a candidate for &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201990\"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;, but lost in the Democratic primary to &lt;a href=\"Marjorie%20Clapprood\"&gt;Marjorie Clapprood&lt;/a&gt;.\nGolden participated in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency\"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration\"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts%20Water%20Resources%20Authority\"&gt;Massachusetts Water Resources Authority&lt;/a&gt;, the Urban Harbors Institute and Save the Harbor/Save the Bay.\nEducation.\nGolden graduated from &lt;a href=\"Yale%20University\"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt; in 1970 and earned his &lt;a href=\"Juris%20Doctor\"&gt;Juris Doctor&lt;/a&gt;ate from &lt;a href=\"Boston%20University%20School%20of%20Law\"&gt;Boston University School of Law&lt;/a&gt; in 1974. Mr. Golden was also awarded an MPA from &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; in 1981.\nRole in Boston Harbor Cleanup.\nAs &lt;a href=\"city%20attorney\"&gt;City Solicitor&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Quincy%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Quincy, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, William Golden filed the lawsuit in December 1982 against the Metropolitan District Commission that initiated the court-ordered cleanup of &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Harbor\"&gt;Boston Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA). Peter Shelley of the &lt;a href=\"Conservation%20Law%20Foundation\"&gt;Conservation Law Foundation&lt;/a&gt; wrote in a 2011 editorial that \"no story about the Boston Harbor cleanup would be complete without mentioning Bill [William] Golden, then solicitor for the City of Quincy, whose fateful jog on the feces-strewn &lt;a href=\"Wollaston%20Beach\"&gt;Wollaston Beach&lt;/a&gt; in 1982 made him mad as hell and got the whole ball rolling.\"\nWilliam Golden's lawsuit against the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Conservation%20and%20Recreation%20%28Massachusetts%29\"&gt;Department of Conservation and Recreation&lt;/a&gt; (DCR) set off the chain of events that in 1986 led federal Judge David Mazzone to order the DCR to comply with the state and federal &lt;a href=\"Clean%20Water%20Act\"&gt;Clean Water Act of 1972&lt;/a&gt;. The legislature created the new Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) to manage Boston's drinking and wastewater. The MWRA subsequently implemented a 13-year, $4.5 billion venture to clean up the harbor.\nSince Golden's lawsuit against the MDC and the subsequent creation of the MWRA, Boston finally stopped pumping its &lt;a href=\"sewage\"&gt;sewage&lt;/a&gt; directly into the harbor, greatly improving the &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ecosystem\"&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"economy\"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt; in the area. Accordingly, in January 1985, State Senator Golden went on to form the nonprofit environmental group Save the Harbor/Save the Bay with Judge Paul Garrity and Boston Globe columnist Ian Menzies, to lobby for the restoration and preservation of Boston Harbor and Massachusetts Bay. The Environmental Protection Agency now calls the Boston Harbor a \"great American jewel.\"\nNational Institute for Coastal and Harbor Infrastructure.\nGolden serves as the &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Director\"&gt;Executive Director&lt;/a&gt; of the National Institute for Coastal and Harbor Infrastructure (NICHI). The website for the non-profit organization states that \"NICHI is committed to building a broad national &lt;a href=\"coalition\"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt; of private and public interests to advocate for a national interstate coastal infrastructure system that integrates, enhances and funds local, regional and state coastal &lt;a href=\"climate%20change%20adaptation\"&gt;climate adaptation&lt;/a&gt; plans.\"\nLaw career.\nWilliam B. Golden currently serves as &lt;a href=\"Of%20Counsel\"&gt;Of Counsel&lt;/a&gt; to the firm Baker, Braverman &amp; Barbadoro, P.C. Mr. Golden has represented clients in the areas of &lt;a href=\"environmental%20law\"&gt;environmental law&lt;/a&gt; and general &lt;a href=\"litigation\"&gt;litigation&lt;/a&gt;, and also heads the &lt;a href=\"Election%20Law\"&gt;Election Law&lt;/a&gt; Practice Group for the firm.\nRestoration of Lightship Nantucket I WLV-612.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightship%20Nantucket\"&gt;Lightship Nantucket I WLV-612&lt;/a&gt; was the last ship to serve a full tour of duty on the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Nantucket%20Shoals\"&gt;Nantucket Shoals&lt;/a&gt; station and the last US lightship in commission. After being decommissioned on 29 March 1985, ending the 165-year era of United States Lightship service, William and his wife Kristen Golden purchased and restored Nantucket 612 as the only fully operational Lightship in the United States."
