    "title": "Korla Pandit",
    "text": "Korla Pandit (September 16, 1921 \u2013 October 2, 1998), born John Roland Redd, was an American musician, composer, pianist, and organist. After moving to California in the late 1940s and getting involved in show business, Redd became known as \"Korla Pandit\", a &lt;a href=\"French%20people%20in%20India\"&gt;French-Indian&lt;/a&gt; musician from New Delhi, India. However, Redd was actually a light-skinned &lt;a href=\"African-American\"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; man from Missouri who &lt;a href=\"passing%20%28racial%20identity%29\"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; as Indian. A pathbreaking musical performer in the early days of television, Redd is known for \"Korla Pandit's Adventures In Music\"; the show was the first all-music program on television. He also performed live and on radio and made various film appearances, becoming known as the \"Godfather of &lt;a href=\"Exotica\"&gt;Exotica&lt;/a&gt;\". Redd maintained the Korla Pandit persona\u2014both in public and in private\u2014until the end of his life.\nEarly life, marriage, and family.\nIn 1921, John Roland Redd was born in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;St. Louis, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. His father, Ernest Redd, was an African-American Baptist pastor. Redd's mother, Doshia O'Nina Johnson, had Anglo and African ancestry. Both parents were descended from African-American enslaved persons. Redd was one of seven children and had light skin and straight hair.\nIn 1922, Redd's family moved to &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Hannibal, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, where they lived for nine years. In 1931, they moved to &lt;a href=\"Columbia%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, where Redd's father was pastor of the second-largest Baptist church in town. Given the &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Crow\"&gt;Jim Crow&lt;/a&gt; restrictions in the state, Redd and his siblings attended racially segregated public schools for African-American children.\nThe Redd family later recalled John Redd as a musical prodigy from the age of three; he could hear a song once and have it memorized, and family members taught him to play piano from an early age. A contemporary of Redd's, the jazz pianist called \"Sir\" &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Thompson%20%28jazz%29\"&gt;Charles Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, knew Redd from Columbia, where they attended high school together. Later in life, Thompson remembered that as a teenager, Redd was the better piano player of the two. The whole Redd family was musically talented; Redd's two sisters sang, and one played piano. His older brother, Ernest Redd Jr. (known as \"Speck\" for his freckles) (1913\u20131974), also became a jazz pianist and later a band leader in &lt;a href=\"Des%20Moines%2C%20Iowa\"&gt;Des Moines, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;. John and Ernest Redd played in groups with their older brother Harry, who was also a musician.\nIn the early 1940s, Redd met his sister Frances's white friend and roommate, Beryl June DeBeeson, a &lt;a href=\"Walt%20Disney%20Pictures\"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt; artist and former dancer. The fell in love and in 1944 they married in &lt;a href=\"Tijuana%2C%20Mexico\"&gt;Tijuana, Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, as interracial marriages (for any person deemed non-white, be they Native American, East Indian, Chinese, or Black) were then illegal in California. Redd and his wife had two sons.\nCareer as musician and entertainer.\nHollywood and the creation of Korla Pandit.\nBy the 1940s, Redd had moved from the Midwest to Los Angeles for more opportunity. His older sisters, Ruth and Frances, had already moved there by 1939. Redd used the name \"Juan Rolando\" to gain a job playing the organ on the Los Angeles radio station &lt;a href=\"KMPC\"&gt;KMPC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Passing%20%28racial%20identity%29\"&gt;Passing&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Mexicans\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; allowed him to join the Musicians Union (which was not open to African-Americans) and opened up additional opportunities for studio and club work.\nRedd and his wife, Beryl, created a new entertainment persona for Redd's use. They thought Redd could have exotic appeal by &lt;a href=\"Passing%20%28racial%20identity%29\"&gt;passing&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"Indian%20people\"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; because most Americans did not know much about people from &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. Beryl designed the makeup and clothing Redd used, and Redd took the name \"Korla Pandit\". He developed an elaborate history and continued to add to it during his career. He stated that he had been born in &lt;a href=\"New%20Delhi\"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, to a &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; singer and an Indian &lt;a href=\"Brahmin\"&gt;Brahmin&lt;/a&gt; government official. Supposedly raised in an upper-class Indian household, Redd claimed to have studied music in England as a child, arrived in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; at age 12, and studied at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. Redd used the Korla Pandit persona\u2014in public and in private\u2014for the rest of his life.\nIn 1948, Redd created and played background music as Korla Pandit for the revival of radio's occult adventure series, \"&lt;a href=\"Chandu%20the%20Magician%20%28radio%29\"&gt;Chandu the Magician&lt;/a&gt;\", achieving atmospheric effects on the &lt;a href=\"Novachord\"&gt;Novachord&lt;/a&gt; and the Hammond CV (Ancestor of C-3) electronic organ. In 1949, he became a regular organist on \"Hollywood Holiday\", a show that was broadcast from a Los Angeles restaurant.\nTelevision success.\nIn 1948, while performing as Korla Pandit in Hollywood at a furrier's fashion show, Redd and his wife Beryl met television pioneer &lt;a href=\"Klaus%20Landsberg\"&gt;Klaus Landsberg&lt;/a&gt;. He offered Redd a television show with the stipulation that the musician would also provide accompaniment for \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20for%20Beany\"&gt;Time for Beany&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Clampett\"&gt;Bob Clampett&lt;/a&gt;'s popular puppet show. \"Korla Pandit's Adventures In Music\" was first telecast on Los Angeles station &lt;a href=\"KTLA\"&gt;KTLA&lt;/a&gt; in February 1949; it was the first all-music program on television. Viewers soon became familiar with the musical opening, \"The Magnetic Theme.\" Landsberg insisted that Redd refrain from speaking and gaze into the camera as he played the &lt;a href=\"Hammond%20organ\"&gt;Hammond organ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steinway%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;Steinway&lt;/a&gt; grand piano, often simultaneously. \"Not once in 900 performances did he speak on camera, preferring instead to communicate with viewers via that hypnotic gaze.\"\nRedd\u2014known to the public as Korla Pandit\u2014became an overnight star and one of early television's pioneering musical artists. He widened the array of music associated with the organ and popularized its use. While never dropping his Indian persona, Redd acquired notable friends such as actor &lt;a href=\"Errol%20Flynn\"&gt;Errol Flynn&lt;/a&gt;, comedian &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Hope\"&gt;Bob Hope&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sabu%20Dastagir\"&gt;Sabu Dastagir&lt;/a&gt;, known for his roles in the documentary \"&lt;a href=\"Elephant%20Boy%20%28film%29\"&gt;Elephant Boy&lt;/a&gt;\" (1937) and the feature \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20of%20Bagdad%20%281940%20film%29\"&gt;Thief of Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;\" (1940).\nIn 1956, Redd moved to San Francisco and performed as Korla Pandit on San Francisco's &lt;a href=\"KGO-TV\"&gt;KGO-TV&lt;/a&gt;. He began speaking on his show, espousing a blend of spiritual ideas that entranced many of his fans. He became friends with &lt;a href=\"Paramahansa%20Yogananda\"&gt;Paramahansa Yogananda&lt;/a&gt;, Indian spiritual leader of the &lt;a href=\"Self%20Realization%20Fellowship\"&gt;Self Realization Fellowship&lt;/a&gt;. Their relationship was close enough that Yogananda wrote an introduction to the liner notes for one of Redd's records, and Redd played at Yogananda's funeral. The late 1950s was the time of the &lt;a href=\"Beat%20generation\"&gt;Beat generation&lt;/a&gt;, which saw many Americans embrace spirituality and Eastern religions, while rejecting traditional values including the need to conform to society's norms and economic materialism. Redd read widely and incorporated a variety of these topics in his talks, including mysticism and &lt;a href=\"Zen\"&gt;Zen&lt;/a&gt; philosophy. In 1967, Redd and his family moved to &lt;a href=\"Vancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Vancouver, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, to prevent his sons from being drafted during the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater career.\nAfter moving to Canada, Redd returned regularly to the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas for work. In the 1970s, as his television popularity waned, he supplemented his income with a variety of increased personal appearances and performances. Continuing to use the Korla Pandit persona, Redd performed at supper clubs, supermarket openings, car agencies, music and department stores, pizza restaurants, lectures, music seminars, private lessons, and the theater organ circuit. He made a cameo appearance as Korla Pandit in &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Burton\"&gt;Tim Burton&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"biopic\"&gt;biopic&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Ed%20Wood%20%28film%29\"&gt;Ed Wood&lt;/a&gt;\" (1994), which drew renewed attention to him as a performer. He performed as a musician in the film.\nRedd's career was revived in the 1990s, and he attracted a new generation, taking them under his wing. \"The Tiki-lounge music revival gave Korla one last career resurgence and cult following. He recorded with &lt;a href=\"The%20Muffs\"&gt;The Muffs&lt;/a&gt;.\" Redd also performed a sold-out show at the legendary &lt;a href=\"Bimbo%27s%20365%20Club\"&gt;Bimbo's 365 Club&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco.\nDeath and revelations.\nRedd died in &lt;a href=\"Petaluma%2C%20California\"&gt;Petaluma, California&lt;/a&gt; on October 2, 1998. He was survived by his wife, Beryl, and their sons, Shari and Koram. (Koram would later rename himself John Pandit.)\nTwo years after Redd's death, R.J. Smith, magazine editor of \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;\", published an article revealing Redd's true ancestry.\nDuring his life, Redd kept in touch with his family of origin, but he wore his turban and did not bring his sons when visiting with them. According to Redd's nephew, Ernest Redd, \"'Among the family we knew what he was doing and very little was said about it. There was times when he would come by, and it was kind of like a sneak visit. He might come at night sometime and be gone before we got up. He had to separate himself from the family to a certain extent. They would go to see him play, but they wouldn\u2019t speak to him. They would go to his show and then they would leave, and the family would greet him at a later time'\". Allyson Hobbs, assistant professor of history at Stanford University, wrote \"A Chosen Exile: A History of Racial Passing in American Life\" (2014). Having met members of Redd's extended family of origin, Hobbs has said that they \"felt he was very authentic and were very close to him\". Redd's sons heard rumors about their father's background, but were only told of his (and their own) African-American heritage after his death. Shari Pandit died before the publication of Smith's 2001 article, and John Pandit rejected Smith's findings.\nIntrigued by the Smith article, John Turner and Eric Christensen, retired TV producers who had each known Redd in his later years, made a documentary entitled \"Korla\" (2014). The duo wrote and produced the film together and Turner directed it. The duo interviewed an array of friends, fellow musicians, and family, discussing Redd's life and achievements and exploring the complexities of racial identity. After \"Korla\" was widely released, various media outlets commented on Redd's history, casting it as a classic American story of self-invention."
