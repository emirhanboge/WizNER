    "text": "The \"K\u00f6nigsberg\" class, sometimes referred to as the K class, was a class of &lt;a href=\"light%20cruiser\"&gt;light cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s of the German &lt;a href=\"Reichsmarine\"&gt;Reichsmarine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt;. The class comprised three ships named after German cities: &lt;a href=\"German%20cruiser%20K%C3%B6nigsberg\"&gt;\"K\u00f6nigsberg\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"German%20cruiser%20Karlsruhe\"&gt;\"Karlsruhe\"&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"German%20cruiser%20K%C3%B6ln\"&gt;\"K\u00f6ln\"&lt;/a&gt;, all built between 1926 and 1930. These ships were the first of the Reichsmarine with a modern cruiser design; their predecessor, &lt;a href=\"German%20cruiser%20Emden\"&gt;\"Emden\"&lt;/a&gt;, was based on World War I-era designs. They were armed with a main battery of nine guns and with twelve &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAll three ships of the class were used extensively as training cruisers throughout the 1930s. They went on numerous overseas cruises and participated in the &lt;a href=\"Non-intervention%20in%20the%20Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;non-intervention patrols&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in 1936\u20131939. After the outbreak of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; in September 1939, the three ships laid defensive minefields in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;. They all saw action in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung\"&gt;Operation Weser\u00fcbung&lt;/a&gt;, the invasion of Norway, in April 1940; \"K\u00f6nigsberg\" was damaged by Norwegian coastal guns outside &lt;a href=\"Bergen\"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt; and sunk by British bombers the following day. \"Karlsruhe\" was sunk by the British &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; ; only \"K\u00f6ln\" survived the attack on Norway.\nAfter returning to Germany, \"K\u00f6ln\" operated &lt;a href=\"Flettner%20Fl%20282\"&gt;Flettner Fl 282&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"helicopter\"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt;s as an experiment. She provided gunfire support to German ground forces during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Barbarossa\"&gt;Operation Barbarossa&lt;/a&gt;, the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, and returned to Norway in 1942. Ultimately, she was sunk in &lt;a href=\"Wilhelmshaven\"&gt;Wilhelmshaven&lt;/a&gt; in March 1945 by American bombers. Her guns were still above water, which allowed her to support the defending German army against British ground forces until the final days of the war.\nDesign.\nGeneral characteristics.\nThe ships of the \"K\u00f6nigsberg\" class were &lt;a href=\"length%20at%20the%20waterline\"&gt;long at the waterline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;long overall&lt;/a&gt;. They had a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a maximum &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . They had a design displacement of and a &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement\"&gt;standard displacement&lt;/a&gt;, as defined by the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Naval%20Treaty\"&gt;Washington Naval Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, of . They displaced at &lt;a href=\"full%20load\"&gt;full load&lt;/a&gt;. The ships' hulls were constructed from longitudinal steel frames and incorporated extensive &lt;a href=\"welding\"&gt;welding&lt;/a&gt; to save weight; up to 85\u00a0percent of the hulls were welded rather than &lt;a href=\"rivet\"&gt;rivet&lt;/a&gt;ed. The hull was divided into nineteen &lt;a href=\"watertight%20compartment\"&gt;watertight compartment&lt;/a&gt;s and had a &lt;a href=\"double%20bottom\"&gt;double bottom&lt;/a&gt; that extended for 72\u00a0percent of the length of the hull.\nThe \"K\u00f6nigsberg\"-class cruisers had a standard crew of 21\u00a0officers and 493\u00a0enlisted men. This later increased to 23\u00a0officers and 588\u2013591\u00a0enlisted men, and during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the crew size rose to between 820 and 850 officers and men. The ships carried a number of smaller vessels, including two &lt;a href=\"picket%20boat\"&gt;picket boat&lt;/a&gt;s, two barges, two &lt;a href=\"Launch%20%28boat%29\"&gt;launches&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"Cutter%20%28boat%29\"&gt;cutter&lt;/a&gt;, and one &lt;a href=\"dinghy\"&gt;dinghy&lt;/a&gt;. The ships were moderately good sea boats, but had the potential to &lt;a href=\"capsize\"&gt;capsize&lt;/a&gt; if internal stores were improperly loaded, and suffered from a slight &lt;a href=\"lee%20helm\"&gt;lee helm&lt;/a&gt;. They heeled up to twenty degrees with the &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; hard over. They were nevertheless very maneuverable and lost little speed in a &lt;a href=\"head%20sea\"&gt;head sea&lt;/a&gt;. In a hard turn, they lost up to 20\u00a0percent speed.\nIn the 1930s, all three members of the class were modified to carry a pair of &lt;a href=\"float%20plane\"&gt;float plane&lt;/a&gt;s for reconnaissance. They were equipped with an &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20catapult\"&gt;aircraft catapult&lt;/a&gt; to launch the planes and cranes to recover them after they landed in the water. The ships initially carried two &lt;a href=\"Heinkel%20He%2060\"&gt;Heinkel He 60&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biplane\"&gt;biplane&lt;/a&gt; float planes, replaced later in the decade with two &lt;a href=\"Arado%20Ar%20196\"&gt;Arado Ar 196&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monoplane\"&gt;monoplane&lt;/a&gt; float planes. Only one aircraft could be stored on the catapult at a time; the second plane had to be disassembled and placed in storage, and the ships did not have a &lt;a href=\"hangar\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt; to store it in.\nMachinery.\nTheir propulsion system consisted of four &lt;a href=\"steam%20turbine\"&gt;steam turbine&lt;/a&gt;s and a pair of 10-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines. The turbines were split into three engine rooms, with the diesels in their own rooms directly aft of the turbines. Steam for the turbines was provided by six Marine-type double-ended oil-fired &lt;a href=\"water-tube%20boiler\"&gt;water-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s. The engines powered a pair of three-bladed screws that were wide on the first two ships and in diameter on \"K\u00f6ln\". The ships' propulsion system provided a top speed of and were rated at , though all three ships exceeded on speed trials. The ships carried of fuel oil as designed, but could store up to . This gave them a range of approximately at and at . Steering was controlled by a single rudder. The ships had three turbo-generators and two diesel generators for electricity; the generators had a combined output of at 220\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Volt\"&gt;Volt&lt;/a&gt;s.\nArmament.\nThe ships were armed with nine &lt;a href=\"15%20cm%20SK%20C/25\"&gt;15 cm SK C/25&lt;/a&gt; guns mounted in three triple &lt;a href=\"gun%20turret\"&gt;gun turret&lt;/a&gt;s. One turret was located forward, and two were placed in a &lt;a href=\"superfire\"&gt;superfiring pair&lt;/a&gt; aft. The rear gun turrets were offset to increase their arc of fire. They were supplied with 1,080 rounds of ammunition, for 120 shells per gun. As built, the ships were also equipped with two &lt;a href=\"8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun\"&gt;8.8\u00a0cm SK L/45&lt;/a&gt; anti-aircraft guns in single mounts; they had 400\u00a0rounds of ammunition each. The \"K\u00f6nigsberg\" class also carried four triple &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt; mounts located amidships; they were supplied with twenty-four &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es, though these were replaced with models by 1940. The ships were also capable of carrying 120 &lt;a href=\"naval%20mine\"&gt;naval mine&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe ships' anti-aircraft batteries were revised and improved throughout the course of their careers. The original single-mounted 8.8\u00a0cm guns were replaced with twin mounts for the new &lt;a href=\"8.8%20cm%20SK%20C/32%20naval%20gun\"&gt;8.8 cm SK C/32&lt;/a&gt; guns and a third twin mount was also installed, bringing the number of guns to six. Eight &lt;a href=\"3.7%20cm%20SK%20C/30\"&gt;3.7 cm SK C/30&lt;/a&gt; guns were installed in the mid-1930s and up to eight &lt;a href=\"2%20cm%20Flak%2030/38/Flakvierling\"&gt;2 cm Flak 30&lt;/a&gt; guns were also added. \"K\u00f6ln\", the only ship to survive to the end of the war, was ultimately armed with eight 3.7\u00a0cm and eighteen 2\u00a0cm guns, though provisions had been made to mount up to ten and twenty-four guns of the two calibers, respectively.\nArmor.\nThe ships were protected by an armored &lt;a href=\"deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; that was thick amidships and tapered down to on either end. They had an &lt;a href=\"belt%20armor\"&gt;armored belt&lt;/a&gt; that was thick and capped with thick &lt;a href=\"Bulkhead%20%28partition%29\"&gt;bulkhead&lt;/a&gt;s on either end of the belt. Underwater protection consisted of a &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20bulkhead\"&gt;torpedo bulkhead&lt;/a&gt; and a 20\u00a0mm collision bulkhead. The &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt; had sides and a roof. The ships' gun turrets had 30\u00a0mm faces and 20\u00a0mm roofs, sides, and rears. The &lt;a href=\"barbette\"&gt;barbette&lt;/a&gt;s for the turrets were also 30\u00a0mm thick. \"Karlsruhe\" was later fitted with increased armor protection, consisting of a outer plating that consisted of the new \"Wotan weich\" steel, and an upper deck that was , also \"Wotan weich\".\nService history.\nAll three ships of the \"K\u00f6nigsberg\" class served as training cruisers for naval cadets throughout the 1930s. They conducted numerous cruises in European waters, and both \"Karlsruhe\" and \"K\u00f6ln\" traveled to other continents. They were all modified throughout the decade, and had their anti-aircraft armament repeatedly improved, along with other alterations. The three ships took part in the &lt;a href=\"Non-intervention%20in%20the%20Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;non-intervention patrols&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in 1936\u20131939, and after the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, they laid a series of defensive minefields in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe three ships then participated in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung\"&gt;Operation Weser\u00fcbung&lt;/a&gt;, the invasion of Norway, in April 1940. \"K\u00f6nigsberg\" and \"K\u00f6ln\" were assigned to the assault on &lt;a href=\"Bergen\"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt;, while \"Karlsruhe\" joined the attack on &lt;a href=\"Kristiansand\"&gt;Kristiansand&lt;/a&gt;. \"K\u00f6nigsberg\" came under heavy fire from a battery outside Bergen, and was badly damaged; after the port was captured, she moved into harbor for temporary repairs. She was ordered to return to Germany, but was attacked the next morning by British bombers and hit by at least five bombs. She sank slowly enough for the majority of her crew to escape; there were only eighteen men killed in the attack.\n\"Karlsruhe\" meanwhile suppressed Norwegian coastal guns outside Kristiansand and successfully landed her contingent of ground troops. After \"Karlsruhe\" left port, the British &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; attacked the German cruiser and hit her with a pair of torpedoes. The torpedo hits knocked out \"Karlsruhe\"s power and thus prevented her crew from pumping out the water that was rapidly flooding the ship. Her crew was taken off by an escorting &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;, which then fired a pair of torpedoes into the stricken cruiser to ensure she sank quickly. Her wreck was later discovered in 2017 and its identity confirmed in September 2020; it lies at a depth of , some off the coast of Norway.\n\"K\u00f6ln\" was the only ship of the class to survive the operations off Norway. After returning to Germany, she was modified to serve as a testbed for the &lt;a href=\"Flettner%20Fl%20282\"&gt;Flettner Fl 282&lt;/a&gt; helicopter. She thereafter served in the Baltic, providing gunfire support to advancing German troops in 1941. In mid 1942, she returned to Norwegian waters, and unsuccessfully attempted to attack &lt;a href=\"Convoy%20PQ%2018\"&gt;Convoy PQ 18&lt;/a&gt; along with several other German warships. She was then ordered back to Germany, where she served in a variety of roles, including training ship and convoy escort, before again returning to Norway. She was damaged by British bombers in December 1944 and forced to return to Germany for repairs. While in dock in &lt;a href=\"Wilhelmshaven\"&gt;Wilhelmshaven&lt;/a&gt; in March 1945, she was attacked and sunk by American heavy bombers. She sank on an even keel, with her guns still above water, which permitted their use against advancing British forces until the final days of the war."
