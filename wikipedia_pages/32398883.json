    "text": "Rizzle Kicks are a British &lt;a href=\"hip%20hop%20music\"&gt;hip hop&lt;/a&gt; duo from &lt;a href=\"Brighton\"&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; consisting of Jordan \"Rizzle\" Stephens (born 25 January 1992) and Harley \"Sylvester\" Alexander-Sule (born 23 November 1991). Their debut album, \"&lt;a href=\"Stereo%20Typical\"&gt;Stereo Typical&lt;/a&gt;\", was released on 31 October 2011. As of May 2012, Rizzle Kicks had sold over 1 million singles and over 600,000 albums in the UK.\nSince 2015, Alexander-Sule has released music under the stage name Jimi Charles Moody, and since 2016, Stephens has released music under the stage names Wildhood and Al, the Native.\nMusical career.\n2006\u20132011: Formation and career beginnings.\nIn 2006, Stephens began attending rap and performance workshops with the Brighton-based charity AudioActive, joined a year later by Alexander-Sule. The pair attended AudioActive's Hip Hop Foundation project and Stephens continued attending workshops and performances until 2010. Stephens is quoted as saying this work helped the duo \"hone our skills and build a passion towards the career that we're in now. AudioActive did us a lot of good and without them we wouldn't be here!\"\nStephens and Alexander-Sule both attended the &lt;a href=\"BRIT%20School\"&gt;BRIT School&lt;/a&gt;, where Stephens studied media and Alexander-Sule studied theatre. Stephens was in the process of making his mixtape \"Minor Breaches of Discipline\" where he rapped over samples of some of their favourite artists (&lt;a href=\"Gorillaz\"&gt;Gorillaz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lily%20Allen\"&gt;Lily Allen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Monkeys\"&gt;Arctic Monkeys&lt;/a&gt;) and asked Alexander-Sule to sing over some of the tracks. Realising how well their styles fitted together, they formed Rizzle Kicks in 2008. The name stems from 'Green &lt;a href=\"Rizla\"&gt;Rizla&lt;/a&gt;', an early nickname given to Stephens by a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; teammate after a crew of the same name from the school that he attended at the time. That nickname evolved into 'Rizzle', and the duo decided on the suffix 'kicks' due to their shared love of football.\nAs a newly formed duo, they hustled for beats from local producers, honing their sound, and created several bedroom demos, three of which ended up on their debut album. They also created a presence online; blogging on their website \"Your Daily Kicks\" as well as posting lo-fi music videos to their &lt;a href=\"YouTube\"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel. The videos were co-directed by the band and made by Toby Lockerbie, a wedding photographer they met at a party. A video was made for a demo of \"&lt;a href=\"Down%20with%20the%20Trumpets\"&gt;Down with the Trumpets&lt;/a&gt;\" in the summer of 2010, closely followed by the video for \"Miss Cigarette\". During that time, they had finished college and Alexander-Sule went on to work as an assistant drama teacher, whilst Stephens was flipping burgers at the Corals Greyhound Stadium in &lt;a href=\"Hove\"&gt;Hove&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir YouTube videos caught the attention of several record labels and in November 2010, they signed to &lt;a href=\"Island%20Records\"&gt;Island Records&lt;/a&gt;, part of &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Music\"&gt;Universal Music&lt;/a&gt;. They continued work on their debut album and worked with several producers including &lt;a href=\"Ant%20Whiting\"&gt;Ant Whiting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Cook\"&gt;Norman Cook&lt;/a&gt; (Fatboy Slim), The Rural, Future Cut, and Craigie Dodds.\n2011\u20132012: \"Stereo Typical\" and commercial success.\nIn June 2011, the duo released a promotional single, \"&lt;a href=\"Prophet%20%28Better%20Watch%20It%29\"&gt;Prophet (Better Watch It)&lt;/a&gt;\" accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"stop%20motion\"&gt;stop motion&lt;/a&gt; style video made up of 960 photographic stills. The track was initially offered as a free download, before being released on iTunes. In July 2011, they learnt they had an unlikely fan, in &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Fry\"&gt;Stephen Fry&lt;/a&gt; who proclaimed over &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that he was \"unexpectedly loving the old school hip hop sounds of Rizzle Kicks.\" Over the summer, Rizzle Kicks played a number of festivals; they supported &lt;a href=\"Dizzee%20Rascal\"&gt;Dizzee Rascal&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ibiza%20Rocks\"&gt;Ibiza Rocks&lt;/a&gt; in June and were invited back to support &lt;a href=\"The%20Streets\"&gt;The Streets&lt;/a&gt;.

On 23 October, they released their second official single \"&lt;a href=\"When%20I%20Was%20a%20Youngster\"&gt;When I Was a Youngster&lt;/a&gt;\" which peaked at #8. Their debut album \"&lt;a href=\"Stereo%20Typical\"&gt;Stereo Typical&lt;/a&gt;\" was released a week later on 31 October 2011, entering the chart at #9, peaking at #5 and was certified platinum in May 2012. Their third single \"&lt;a href=\"Mama%20Do%20the%20Hump\"&gt;Mama Do the Hump&lt;/a&gt;\", which was produced by &lt;a href=\"Norman%20Cook\"&gt;Norman Cook&lt;/a&gt;, a.k.a. Fatboy Slim, was released on 16 December, eventually peaking at #2 and has been certified platinum. The lo-fi video features a cameo from &lt;a href=\"James%20Corden\"&gt;James Corden&lt;/a&gt;. The track spawned a dance craze known as 'The Hump' which infiltrated parties across the UK and generated many YouTube videos of members of the public doing the dance.\nThe pair featured on \"&lt;a href=\"Heart%20Skips%20a%20Beat%20%28Olly%20Murs%20song%29\"&gt;Heart Skips a Beat&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Olly%20Murs\"&gt;Olly Murs&lt;/a&gt;, which was released on 21 August 2011, entering the chart at #1 on 28 August 2011.
