    "text": "Scarlet fever is an &lt;a href=\"Infection\"&gt;infectious disease&lt;/a&gt; resulting from a &lt;a href=\"group%20A%20streptococcal%20infection\"&gt;group A streptococcus (group A strep) infection&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"&lt;a href=\"Streptococcus%20pyogenes\"&gt;Streptococcus pyogenes&lt;/a&gt;\". The signs and symptoms include a &lt;a href=\"sore%20throat\"&gt;sore throat&lt;/a&gt;, fever, headaches, &lt;a href=\"lymphadenopathy\"&gt;swollen lymph nodes&lt;/a&gt;, and a characteristic rash. The rash is red and feels like &lt;a href=\"sandpaper\"&gt;sandpaper&lt;/a&gt; and the tongue may be red and bumpy. It most commonly affects children between five and 15 years of age.\nScarlet fever affects a small number of people who have &lt;a href=\"strep%20throat\"&gt;strep throat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"streptococcal%20skin%20infection\"&gt;streptococcal skin infection&lt;/a&gt;s. The bacteria are usually spread by people coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread when a person touches an object that has the bacteria on it and then touches their mouth or nose. The characteristic rash is due to the &lt;a href=\"erythrogenic%20toxin\"&gt;erythrogenic toxin&lt;/a&gt;, a substance produced by some types of the bacterium. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by &lt;a href=\"throat%20culture\"&gt;culturing the throat&lt;/a&gt;.\n there is no &lt;a href=\"vaccine\"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. Prevention is by frequent &lt;a href=\"handwashing\"&gt;handwashing&lt;/a&gt;, not sharing personal items, and staying away from other people when sick. The disease is treatable with &lt;a href=\"antibiotics\"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, which prevent most complications. Outcomes with scarlet fever are typically good if treated. Long-term complications as a result of scarlet fever include &lt;a href=\"glomerulonephritis\"&gt;kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rheumatic%20heart%20disease\"&gt;rheumatic heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and arthritis. In the early 20th century, before antibiotics were available, it was a leading cause of death in children. An &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20fever%20serum\"&gt;antitoxin&lt;/a&gt; was produced before antibiotics; however, it was never made in sufficient quantities, and could not be used to treat any other disease as antibiotics can.\nThere have been signs of antibiotic resistance, and there have been recent outbreaks in Hong Kong in 2011 and in the UK in 2014, with occurrence rising 68% in the UK in the four years up to 2018. Research published in October 2020 has shown that infection of the bacterium by three viruses has led to stronger strains of the bacterium.\nSigns and symptoms.\nRash which has a characteristic appearance, spreading pattern, and &lt;a href=\"Desquamation\"&gt;desquamating&lt;/a&gt; process e.g.\n\"Strawberry tongue\":\nStrep throat.\nTypical &lt;a href=\"signs%20and%20symptoms\"&gt;signs and symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"streptococcal%20pharyngitis\"&gt;streptococcal pharyngitis&lt;/a&gt; (also known as strep throat):\nThe following signs will usually be absent: cough, hoarseness, runny nose, diarrhea, and &lt;a href=\"conjunctivitis\"&gt;conjunctivitis&lt;/a&gt;. Such symptoms indicate what is more likely a viral infection.\nRash.\nThe rash begins 12 days following the onset of symptoms caused by the strep pharyngitis (sore throat, fever, fatigue). This characteristic rash has been denoted as \"scarlatiniform\", and it appears as a diffuse redness of the skin with small papules, or bumps, which resemble goose bumps. These bumps are what give the characteristic &lt;a href=\"sandpaper\"&gt;sandpaper&lt;/a&gt; texture to the rash. The reddened skin will blanch when pressure is applied to it. The skin may feel itchy, but it will not be painful. The rash generally starts at the flexion of the elbow and other surfaces. It appears next on the trunk and gradually spreads out to the arms and legs. The palms, soles and face are usually left uninvolved by the rash. The face, however, is usually flushed, most prominently in the cheeks, with a ring of paleness around the mouth. After the rash spreads, it becomes more pronounced in creases in the skin, such as the skin folds in the inguinal and axillary regions of the body. Also in those areas, Pastia's Lines may appear: petechiae arranged in a linear pattern. Within 1 week of onset, the rash begins to fade followed by a longer process of &lt;a href=\"desquamation\"&gt;desquamation&lt;/a&gt;, or shedding of the outer layer of skin. This lasts several weeks. The desquamation process usually begins on the face and progresses downward on the body. After the desquamation, the skin will be left with a sunburned appearance.\nMouth.\nThe streptococcal pharyngitis, which is the usual presentation of scarlet fever in combination with the characteristic rash, commonly involves the tonsils. The tonsils will appear swollen and reddened. The palate and uvula are also commonly affected by the infection. The involvement of the soft palate can be seen as tiny red and round spots known as &lt;a href=\"Forchheimer%20spots\"&gt;Forchheimer spots&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariable presentations.\nThe features of scarlet fever can differ depending on the age and race of the person. Children less than 5 years old can have atypical presentations. Children less than 3 years old can present with nasal congestion and a lower grade fever. Infants may present with symptoms of increased irritability and decreased appetite.\nChildren who have darker skin can have a different presentation, as the redness of the skin involved in the rash and the ring of paleness around the mouth can be less obvious. Suspicion based on accompanying symptoms and diagnostic studies are important in these cases.\nCourse.\nFollowing exposure to streptococcus, onset of symptoms occur 12 hours to 7 days later. These may include fever, fatigue, and sore throat. The characteristic scarlatiniform rash appears 12\u201348 hours later. During the first few days of the rash development and rapid generalization, the Pastia's Lines and strawberry tongue are also present. The rash starts fading within 3\u20134 days, followed by the desquamation of the rash, which lasts several weeks to a month. If the case of scarlet fever is uncomplicated, recovery from the fever and clinical symptoms, other than the process of desquamation, occurs in 5\u201310 days.\nComplications.\nThe complications, which can arise from scarlet fever when left untreated or inadequately treated, can be divided into two categories: suppurative and nonsuppurative.\n&lt;a href=\"Suppuration\"&gt;Suppurative&lt;/a&gt; complications: These are rare complications that arise either from direct spread to structures that are close to the primary site of infection, or spread through the &lt;a href=\"lymphatic%20system\"&gt;lymphatic system&lt;/a&gt; or blood. In the first case, scarlet fever may spread to the pharynx. Possible problems from this method of spread include peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, &lt;a href=\"cellulitis\"&gt;cellulitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mastoiditis\"&gt;mastoiditis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sinusitis\"&gt;sinusitis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the second case, the streptococcal infection may spread through the &lt;a href=\"lymphatic%20system\"&gt;lymphatic system&lt;/a&gt; or the blood to areas of the body further away from the pharynx. A few examples of the many complications that can arise from those methods of spread include &lt;a href=\"endocarditis\"&gt;endocarditis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pneumonia\"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"meningitis\"&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;.\nNonsuppurative complications: These complications arise from certain subtypes of group A streptococci that cause an autoimmune response in the body through what has been termed &lt;a href=\"molecular%20mimicry\"&gt;molecular mimicry&lt;/a&gt;. In these cases, the antibodies which the person's immune system developed to attack the group A streptococci are also able to attack the person's own tissues. The following complications result, depending on which tissues in the person's body are targeted by those antibodies.\nCause.\nStrep throat spreads by close contact among people, via respiratory droplets (for example, saliva or nasal discharge). A person in close contact with another person infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis has a 35% chance of becoming infected. One in ten children who are infected with group A streptococcal pharyngitis will develop scarlet fever.\nPathophysiology.\nThe rash of scarlet fever, which is what differentiates this disease from an isolated group A strep pharyngitis (or strep throat), is caused by specific strains of group A streptococcus which produce a &lt;a href=\"Erythrogenic%20toxin\"&gt;pyrogenic exotoxin&lt;/a&gt;. These toxin-producing strains cause scarlet fever in people who do not already have antitoxin &lt;a href=\"Antibody\"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt;. Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A, B, and C (speA, speB, and speC) have been identified. The pyrogenic exotoxins are also called erythrogenic toxins and cause the &lt;a href=\"erythema\"&gt;erythema&lt;/a&gt;tous rash of scarlet fever. The strains of group A streptococcus that cause scarlet fever need specific bacteriophages for there to be pyrogenic exotoxin production. Specifically, &lt;a href=\"bacteriophage%20T12\"&gt;bacteriophage T12&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for the production of speA. Streptococcal Pyrogenic Exotoxin A, speA, is the one which is most commonly associated with cases of scarlet fever which are complicated by the immune-mediated sequelae acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.\nThese toxins are also known as \"&lt;a href=\"superantigen\"&gt;superantigen&lt;/a&gt;s\" because they are able to cause an extensive immune response within the body through activation of some of the main cells responsible for the person's immune system. The body responds to these toxins by making antibodies to those specific toxins. However, those antibodies do not completely protect the person from future group A streptococcal infections, because there are 12 different pyrogenic exotoxins possible.\nMicrobiology.\nThe disease is caused by secretion of &lt;a href=\"pyrogen%20%28fever%29\"&gt;pyrogenic&lt;/a&gt; exotoxins by the infecting \"Streptococcus\" bacteria. &lt;a href=\"Erythrogenic%20toxin\"&gt;Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A&lt;/a&gt; (\"speA\") is probably the best studied of these toxins. It is carried by the bacteriophage T12 which integrates into the streptococcal genome from where the toxin is transcribed. The phage itself integrates into a serine tRNA gene on the chromosome.\nThe T12 virus itself has not been placed into a taxon by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Committee%20on%20Taxonomy%20of%20Viruses\"&gt;International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses&lt;/a&gt;. It has a double-stranded DNA genome and on morphological grounds appears to be a member of the \"&lt;a href=\"Siphoviridae\"&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe \"speA\" gene was cloned and sequenced in 1986. It is 753 base pairs in length and encodes a 29.244 &lt;a href=\"Atomic%20mass%20unit\"&gt;kiloDalton&lt;/a&gt; (kDa) &lt;a href=\"protein\"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;. The protein contains a putative 30-\namino-acid &lt;a href=\"signal%20peptide\"&gt;signal peptide&lt;/a&gt;; removal of the signal sequence gives a predicted molecular weight of 25.787 kDa for the secreted protein. Both a promoter and a ribosome binding site (&lt;a href=\"Shine-Dalgarno%20sequence\"&gt;Shine-Dalgarno sequence&lt;/a&gt;) are present upstream of the gene. A transcriptional terminator is located 69 bases downstream from the translational termination &lt;a href=\"codon\"&gt;codon&lt;/a&gt;. The carboxy terminal portion of the protein exhibits extensive homology with the carboxy terminus of \"&lt;a href=\"Staphylococcus%20aureus\"&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Enterotoxin%20type%20B\"&gt;enterotoxins B&lt;/a&gt; and C1.\nStreptococcal phages other than T12 may also carry the \"speA\" gene.\nDiagnosis.\nAlthough the presentation of scarlet fever can be clinically diagnosed, further testing may be required to distinguish it from other illnesses. Also, history of a recent exposure to someone with &lt;a href=\"strep%20throat\"&gt;strep throat&lt;/a&gt; can be useful in diagnosis. There are two methods used to confirm suspicion of scarlet fever; &lt;a href=\"rapid%20antigen%20detection%20test\"&gt;rapid antigen detection test&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"throat%20culture\"&gt;throat culture&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rapid antigen detection test is a very &lt;a href=\"Sensitivity%20and%20specificity\"&gt;specific test&lt;/a&gt; but not very sensitive. This means that if the result is positive (indicating that the group A strep antigen was detected and therefore confirming that the person has a group A strep pharyngitis), then it is appropriate to treat the people with scarlet fever with antibiotics. But, if the rapid antigen detection test is negative (indicating that they do not have group A strep pharyngitis), then a throat culture is required to confirm, as the first test could have yielded a &lt;a href=\"False%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives\"&gt;false negative&lt;/a&gt; result. In the early 21st century, the throat culture is the current \"gold standard\" for diagnosis.\n&lt;a href=\"Serology\"&gt;Serologic testing&lt;/a&gt; seeks evidence of the antibodies that the body produces against the streptococcal infection, including antistreptolysin-O and antideoxyribonuclease B. It takes the body 2\u20133 weeks to make these antibodies, so this type of testing is not useful for diagnosing a current infection. But, it is useful when assessing a person who may have one of the complications from a previous streptococcal infection.\nThroat cultures done after antibiotic therapy can show if the infection has been removed. These throat swabs, however, are not indicated, because up to 25% of properly treated individuals can continue to carry the streptococcal infection while being asymptomatic.\nPrevention.\nOne method is long-term use of antibiotics to prevent future group A streptococcal infections. This method is only indicated for people who have had complications like recurrent attacks of acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease. Antibiotics are limited in their ability to prevent these infections since there are a variety of subtypes of group A streptococci that can cause the infection.\nThe vaccine approach has a greater likelihood of effectively preventing group A streptococcal infections because vaccine formulations can target multiple subtypes of the bacteria. A vaccine developed by George and Gladys Dick in 1924 was discontinued due to poor efficacy and the introduction of antibiotics. Difficulties in vaccine development include the considerable strain variety of group A streptococci present in the environment and the amount of time and number of people needed for appropriate trials for safety and efficacy of any potential vaccine. There have been several attempts to create a vaccine in the past few decades. These vaccines, which are still in the development phase, expose the person to proteins present on the surface of the group A streptococci to activate an immune response that will prepare the person to fight and prevent future infections.\nThere used to be a diphtheria scarlet fever vaccine. It was, however, found not to be effective. This product was discontinued by the end of World War II.\nTreatment.\n&lt;a href=\"Antibiotics\"&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; to combat the streptococcal infection are the mainstay of treatment for scarlet fever. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics decreases the length of illness. Peeling of the outer layer of skin, however, will happen despite treatment. One of the main goals of treatment is to prevent the child from developing one of the suppurative or nonsuppurative complications, especially acute rheumatic fever. As long as antibiotics are started within nine days, it is very unlikely for the child to develop acute rheumatic fever. Antibiotic therapy has not been shown to prevent the development of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Another important reason for prompt treatment with antibiotics is the ability to prevent transmission of the infection between children. An infected individual is most likely to pass on the infection to another person during the first 2 weeks. A child is no longer contagious (able to pass the infection to another child) after 24 hours of antibiotics.\nThe antibiotic of choice is &lt;a href=\"Penicillin%20V%20\"&gt;Penicillin V &lt;/a&gt; which is taken by mouth in pill form. Children who are not able to take pills can be given &lt;a href=\"amoxicillin\"&gt;amoxicillin&lt;/a&gt; which comes in a liquid form and is equally effective. Duration of treatment is 10 days. &lt;a href=\"Benzathine%20penicillin%20G\"&gt;Benzathine penicillin G&lt;/a&gt; can be given as a one time intramuscular injection as another alternative if swallowing pills is not possible. If the person is allergic to the family of antibiotics which both penicillin and amoxicillin are a part of (&lt;a href=\"%CE%92-lactam%20antibiotic\"&gt;beta-lactam antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;), a first generation &lt;a href=\"cephalosporin\"&gt;cephalosporin&lt;/a&gt; is used. Cephalosporin antibiotics, however, can still cause adverse reactions in people whose allergic reaction to penicillin is a &lt;a href=\"Type%20I%20hypersensitivity%20reaction\"&gt;Type 1 Hypersensitivity reaction&lt;/a&gt;. In those cases it is appropriate to choose &lt;a href=\"clindamycin\"&gt;clindamycin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"erythromycin\"&gt;erythromycin&lt;/a&gt; instead. &lt;a href=\"Tonsillectomy\"&gt;Tonsillectomy&lt;/a&gt;, although once a reasonable treatment for recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, is not indicated, as a person can still be infected with group A streptococcus without their tonsils.\nAntibiotic resistance and resurgence.\nA &lt;a href=\"Drug%20resistance\"&gt;drug-resistant&lt;/a&gt; strain of scarlet fever, resistant to &lt;a href=\"macrolide\"&gt;macrolide&lt;/a&gt; antibiotics such as &lt;a href=\"erythromycin\"&gt;erythromycin&lt;/a&gt;, but retaining drug-sensitivity to &lt;a href=\"beta-lactam%20antibiotics\"&gt;beta-lactam antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; such as penicillin, emerged in Hong Kong in 2011, accounting for at least two deaths in that city\u2014the first such in over a decade. About 60% of circulating strains of the group A streptococcus that cause scarlet fever in Hong Kong are resistant to macrolide &lt;a href=\"antibiotic%20resistance\"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, says Professor &lt;a href=\"Yuen%20Kwok-yung\"&gt;Kwok-yung Yuen&lt;/a&gt;, head of &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20University\"&gt;Hong Kong University&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"microbiology\"&gt;microbiology&lt;/a&gt; department. Previously, observed &lt;a href=\"antibiotic%20resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; rates had been 10\u201330%; the increase is likely the result of overuse of macrolide antibiotics in recent years.\nThere was also an outbreak in the UK in 2014, and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Health%20Service\"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt; reported a 68% increase in the number of \"S. pyogenes\" identified in laboratory reports between 2014 and 2018.\nNew research published in October 2020 in the journal that the bacterium appears to be getting more robust after being infected with viruses, specifically the North-East Asian serotype M12 (emm12) (group A Streptococcus, GAS). They found three new genes, acquired from viruses, leading to the development of \"&lt;a href=\"superantigen\"&gt;superantigen&lt;/a&gt;s\" targeting &lt;a href=\"white%20blood%20cell\"&gt;white blood cell&lt;/a&gt;s, leading to a more virulent strain of the bacterium.\nA vaccine that will protect against the 180 to 200 types of bacteria causing the disease has been worked on for over 20 years, but a safe one had not yet been developed.\nEpidemiology.\nScarlet fever occurs equally in both males and females. Children are most commonly infected, typically between 5\u201315 years old. Although streptococcal infections can happen at any time of year, infection rates peak in the winter and spring months, typically in colder climates.\nThe morbidity and mortality of scarlet fever has declined since the 18th and 19th century when there were epidemics caused by this disease. Around 1900 the mortality rate in multiple places reached 25%. The improvement in prognosis can be attributed to the use of penicillin in the treatment of this disease. The frequency of scarlet fever cases has also been declining over the past century. There have been several reported outbreaks of the disease in various countries in the past decade. The reason for these recent increases remains unclear in the medical community. Between 2013 and 2016 population rates of scarlet fever in England increased from 8.2 to 33.2 per 100,000 and hospital admissions for scarlet fever increased by 97%.\nHistory.\nIt is unclear when a description of this disease was first recorded. &lt;a href=\"Hippocrates\"&gt;Hippocrates&lt;/a&gt;, writing around 400 BC, described the condition of a person with a reddened skin and fever.\nThe first unambiguous description of the disease in the medical literature appeared in the 1553 book \"De Tumoribus praeter Naturam\" by the &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicilian&lt;/a&gt; anatomist and physician &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Filippo%20Ingrassia\"&gt;Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia&lt;/a&gt;, where he referred to it as \"rossalia\". He also made a point to distinguish that this presentation had different characteristics from &lt;a href=\"measles\"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;. It was redescribed by &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Weyer\"&gt;Johann Weyer&lt;/a&gt; during an epidemic in lower Germany between 1564 and 1565; he referred to it as \"scarlatina anginosa\". The first unequivocal description of scarlet fever appeared in a book by &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Coytard%20de%20Thaire\"&gt;Joannes Coyttarus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Poitiers\"&gt;Poitiers&lt;/a&gt;, , which was published in 1578 in Paris. &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Sennert\"&gt;Daniel Sennert&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wittenberg\"&gt;Wittenberg&lt;/a&gt; described the classical 'scarlatinal desquamation' in 1572 and was also the first to describe the early &lt;a href=\"arthritis\"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, scarlatinal &lt;a href=\"dropsy\"&gt;dropsy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ascites\"&gt;ascites&lt;/a&gt; associated with the disease.\nIn 1675 the term that has been commonly used to refer to scarlet fever, \"scarlatina\", was written by &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Sydenham\"&gt;Thomas Sydenham&lt;/a&gt;, an English physician.\nIn 1827, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Bright%20%28physician%29\"&gt;Richard Bright&lt;/a&gt; was the first to recognize the involvement of the renal system in scarlet fever.\nThe association between streptococci and disease was first described in 1874 by &lt;a href=\"Theodor%20Billroth\"&gt;Theodor Billroth&lt;/a&gt;, discussing people with skin infections. Billroth also coined the genus name \"Streptococcus\". In 1884 &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Julius%20Rosenbach\"&gt;Friedrich Julius Rosenbach&lt;/a&gt; edited the name to its current one, \"Streptococcus pyogenes,\" after further looking at the bacteria in the skin lesions. The organism was first cultured in 1883 by the German surgeon &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Fehleisen\"&gt;Friedrich Fehleisen&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"erysipelas\"&gt;erysipelas&lt;/a&gt; lesions.\nAlso in 1884, the German physician &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Loeffler\"&gt;Friedrich Loeffler&lt;/a&gt; was the first to show the presence of streptococci in the throats of people with scarlet fever. Because not all people with pharyngeal streptococci developed scarlet fever, these findings remained controversial for some time. The association between streptococci and scarlet fever was confirmed by &lt;a href=\"Alphonse%20Dochez\"&gt;Alphonse Dochez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"George%20Frederick%20Dick\"&gt;George&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gladys%20Dick\"&gt;Gladys Dick&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1900s.\nAlso in 1884, the world's first convalescent home for people with scarlet fever was opened at Brockley Hill, Stanmore, founded by &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Wardell\"&gt;Mary Wardell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Nil%20Filatov\"&gt;Nil Filatov&lt;/a&gt; (in 1895) and &lt;a href=\"Clement%20Dukes\"&gt;Clement Dukes&lt;/a&gt; (in 1894) described an exanthematous disease which they thought was a form of &lt;a href=\"rubella\"&gt;rubella&lt;/a&gt;, but in 1900, Dukes described it as a separate illness which came to be known as &lt;a href=\"Dukes%27%20disease\"&gt;Dukes' disease&lt;/a&gt;, Filatov's disease, or fourth disease. However, in 1979, Keith Powell identified it as in fact the same illness as the form of scarlet fever which is caused by staphylococcal exotoxin and is known as &lt;a href=\"staphylococcal%20scalded%20skin%20syndrome\"&gt;staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20fever%20serum\"&gt;Scarlet fever serum&lt;/a&gt; from horses' blood was used in the treatment of children beginning in 1900 and reduced mortality rates significantly.\nIn 1906, the Austrian &lt;a href=\"pediatrician\"&gt;pediatrician&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clemens%20von%20Pirquet\"&gt;Clemens von Pirquet&lt;/a&gt; postulated that disease-causing immune complexes were responsible for the &lt;a href=\"nephritis\"&gt;nephritis&lt;/a&gt; that followed scarlet fever.\n&lt;a href=\"Bacteriophage\"&gt;Bacteriophage&lt;/a&gt;s were discovered in 1915 by &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20Twort\"&gt;Frederick Twort&lt;/a&gt;. His work was overlooked and bacteriophages were later rediscovered by &lt;a href=\"Felix%20d%27Herelle\"&gt;Felix d'Herelle&lt;/a&gt; in 1917. The specific association of scarlet fever with the group A streptococci had to await the development of &lt;a href=\"Rebecca%20Lancefield\"&gt;Lancefield's&lt;/a&gt; streptococcal grouping scheme in the 1920s. George and Gladys Dick showed that cell-free filtrates could induce the erythematous reaction characteristic of scarlet fever, proving that this reaction was due to a toxin. Karelitz and Stempien discovered that extracts from human serum globulin and placental globulin can be used as lightening agents for scarlet fever and this was used later as the basis for the Dick test. The association of scarlet fever and bacteriophages was described in 1926 by Cantucuzene and Boncieu.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20fever%20serum\"&gt;antitoxin&lt;/a&gt; for scarlet fever was developed in 1924.\nThe first toxin which causes this disease was cloned and sequenced in 1986 by Weeks and Ferretti. The discovery of penicillin and its subsequent widespread use has significantly reduced the mortality of this once feared disease. Reports of cases of scarlet fever have been on the rise in countries including England, &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, China, and Hong Kong in recent years. Researchers are unsure as to what has caused the spike in cases of the disease.\nThe Dick test.\nThe Dick test, invented in 1924 by &lt;a href=\"George%20F.%20Dick\"&gt;George F. Dick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gladys%20Dick\"&gt;Gladys Dick&lt;/a&gt;, was used to identify those susceptible to scarlet fever. The Dick test consisted of injecting a diluted strain of the streptococci known to cause scarlet fever into a person's skin. A local reaction in the skin at the site of injection appeared in people who were susceptible to developing scarlet fever. This reaction was most notable around 24 hours after the injection but could be seen as early as 4\u20136 hours. If there is no reaction seen in the skin, then that person was assumed to have already developed immunity to the disease and was not at risk of developing it."
