    "text": "A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of &lt;a href=\"stock\"&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt;s (also called shares), which represent &lt;a href=\"ownership\"&gt;ownership&lt;/a&gt; claims on businesses; these may include \"securities\" listed on a public &lt;a href=\"stock%20exchange\"&gt;stock exchange&lt;/a&gt;, as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies which are sold to &lt;a href=\"investor\"&gt;investor&lt;/a&gt;s through &lt;a href=\"equity%20crowdfunding\"&gt;equity crowdfunding&lt;/a&gt; platforms. Investment in the stock market is most often done via &lt;a href=\"stockbroker\"&gt;stockbroker&lt;/a&gt;ages and &lt;a href=\"electronic%20trading%20platform\"&gt;electronic trading platform&lt;/a&gt;s. Investment is usually made with an &lt;a href=\"investment%20strategy\"&gt;investment strategy&lt;/a&gt; in mind. \nStocks can be categorized by the country where the company is domiciled. For example, &lt;a href=\"Nestl%C3%A9\"&gt;Nestl\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Novartis\"&gt;Novartis&lt;/a&gt; are domiciled in &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; and traded on the &lt;a href=\"SIX%20Swiss%20Exchange\"&gt;SIX Swiss Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, so they may be considered as part of the &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on exchanges in other countries, for example, as &lt;a href=\"American%20depositary%20receipt\"&gt;American depositary receipt&lt;/a&gt;s (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.\nSize of the markets.\nThe total &lt;a href=\"market%20capitalization\"&gt;market capitalization&lt;/a&gt; of all publicly traded securities worldwide rose from US$2.5 trillion in 1980 to US$93.7 trillion at the end of 2020.\n, there are 60 stock exchanges in the world. Of these, there are 16 exchanges with a &lt;a href=\"market%20capitalization\"&gt;market capitalization&lt;/a&gt; of $1 trillion or more, and they account for 87% of &lt;a href=\"global%20market\"&gt;global market&lt;/a&gt; capitalization. Apart from the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Securities%20Exchange\"&gt;Australian Securities Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, these 16 exchanges are all in &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy country, the largest stock markets as of January 2021 are in the United States of America (about 55.9%), followed by Japan (about 7.4%) and China (about 5.4%).\nStock exchange.\nA &lt;a href=\"stock%20exchange\"&gt;stock exchange&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"Exchange%20%28organized%20market%29\"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; (or bourse) where &lt;a href=\"stockbroker\"&gt;stockbroker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stock%20trader\"&gt;traders&lt;/a&gt; can buy and sell &lt;a href=\"share%20%28finance%29\"&gt;share&lt;/a&gt;s (equity &lt;a href=\"stock\"&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"security%20%28finance%29\"&gt;securities&lt;/a&gt;. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. These and other stocks may also be traded \"&lt;a href=\"Over-the-counter%20%28finance%29\"&gt;over the counter&lt;/a&gt;\" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.\nStock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed-interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives, which are more likely to be traded OTC.\nTrade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. &lt;a href=\"Equity%20%28finance%29\"&gt;Equities&lt;/a&gt; (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.\nParticipants in the stock market range from small individual &lt;a href=\"stock%20investors\"&gt;stock investors&lt;/a&gt; to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"insurance\"&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt; companies, &lt;a href=\"pension%20fund\"&gt;pension fund&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hedge%20fund\"&gt;hedge fund&lt;/a&gt;s. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange &lt;a href=\"trader%20%28finance%29\"&gt;trader&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as &lt;a href=\"open%20outcry\"&gt;open outcry&lt;/a&gt;. This method is used in some stock exchanges and &lt;a href=\"commodities%20exchange\"&gt;commodities exchange&lt;/a&gt;s, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the &lt;a href=\"NASDAQ\"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/a&gt;.\nA potential buyer \"bids\" a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller \"asks\" a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling \"at the &lt;a href=\"Market%20%28economics%29\"&gt;Market&lt;/a&gt;\" means you will accept \"any\" ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.\nThe purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a &lt;a href=\"marketplace\"&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating &lt;a href=\"price%20discovery\"&gt;price discovery&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20market\"&gt;hybrid market&lt;/a&gt; for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the &lt;a href=\"trading%20floor\"&gt;trading floor&lt;/a&gt;. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a &lt;a href=\"floor%20broker\"&gt;floor broker&lt;/a&gt;, who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated &lt;a href=\"market%20maker\"&gt;market maker&lt;/a&gt; (\"DMM\") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a &lt;a href=\"bid%E2%80%93ask%20spread\"&gt;bid\u2013ask spread&lt;/a&gt; exists, no trade immediately takes place \u2013 in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the \"tape\" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for &lt;a href=\"program%20trading\"&gt;program trading&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"NASDAQ\"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/a&gt; is an electronic exchange, where all of the trading is done over a &lt;a href=\"computer%20network\"&gt;computer network&lt;/a&gt;. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ &lt;a href=\"market%20maker\"&gt;market maker&lt;/a&gt;s will always provide a bid and ask the price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Bourse\"&gt;Paris Bourse&lt;/a&gt;, now part of &lt;a href=\"Euronext\"&gt;Euronext&lt;/a&gt;, is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. &lt;a href=\"Stockbroker\"&gt;Stockbroker&lt;/a&gt;s met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the &lt;a href=\"CATS%20%28trading%20system%29\"&gt;CATS trading system&lt;/a&gt; was introduced, and the &lt;a href=\"order%20matching%20system\"&gt;order matching system&lt;/a&gt; was fully automated.\nPeople trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are &lt;a href=\"Instinet\"&gt;Instinet&lt;/a&gt;, and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the &lt;a href=\"Commission%20%28remuneration%29\"&gt;commissions&lt;/a&gt; of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as &lt;a href=\"adverse%20selection\"&gt;adverse selection&lt;/a&gt;. Financial regulators have probed &lt;a href=\"dark%20pool\"&gt;dark pool&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMarket participant.\n&lt;a href=\"Market%20participant\"&gt;Market participant&lt;/a&gt;s include individual retail investors, &lt;a href=\"institutional%20investor\"&gt;institutional investor&lt;/a&gt;s (e.g., &lt;a href=\"pension%20fund\"&gt;pension fund&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"insurance%20companies\"&gt;insurance companies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mutual%20fund\"&gt;mutual fund&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"index%20fund\"&gt;index fund&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"exchange-traded%20fund\"&gt;exchange-traded fund&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hedge%20fund\"&gt;hedge fund&lt;/a&gt;s, investor groups, banks and various other &lt;a href=\"financial%20institution\"&gt;financial institution&lt;/a&gt;s), and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares. &lt;a href=\"Robo-advisor\"&gt;Robo-advisor&lt;/a&gt;s, which automate investment for individuals are also major participants.\nDemographics of market participation.\nIndirect vs. Direct Investment.\nIndirect investment involves owning shares indirectly, such as via a mutual fund or an exchange traded fund. Direct investment involves direct ownership of shares.\nDirect ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000. Indirect participation in the form of retirement accounts rose from 39.3% in 1992 to 52.6% in 2007, with the median value of these accounts more than doubling from $22,000 to $45,000 in that time. Rydqvist, Spizman, and &lt;a href=\"Ilya%20Strebulaev\"&gt;Strebulaev&lt;/a&gt; attribute the differential growth in direct and indirect holdings to differences in the way each are taxed in the United States. Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.\nParticipation by income and wealth strata.\nRates of participation and the value of holdings differ significantly across strata of income. In the bottom quintile of income, 5.5% of households directly own stock and 10.7% hold stocks indirectly in the form of retirement accounts. The top decile of income has a direct participation rate of 47.5% and an indirect participation rate in the form of retirement accounts of 89.6%. The median value of directly owned stock in the bottom quintile of income is $4,000 and is $78,600 in the top decile of income as of 2007. The median value of indirectly held stock in the form of retirement accounts for the same two groups in the same year is $6,300 and $214,800 respectively. Since the Great Recession of 2008 households in the bottom half of the income distribution have lessened their participation rate both directly and indirectly from 53.2% in 2007 to 48.8% in 2013, while over the same period households in the top decile of the income distribution slightly increased participation 91.7% to 92.1%. The mean value of direct and indirect holdings at the bottom half of the income distribution moved slightly downward from $53,800 in 2007 to $53,600 in 2013. In the top decile, mean value of all holdings fell from $982,000 to $969,300 in the same time. The mean value of all stock holdings across the entire income distribution is valued at $269,900 as of 2013.\nParticipation by race and gender.\nThe racial composition of stock market ownership shows households headed by whites are nearly four and six times as likely to directly own stocks than households headed by blacks and Hispanics respectively. As of 2011 the national rate of direct participation was 19.6%, for white households the participation rate was 24.5%, for black households it was 6.4% and for Hispanic households it was 4.3%. Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female-headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.\nDeterminants and possible explanations of stock market participation.\nIn a 2003 paper by Vissing-J\u00f8rgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing. Her research concludes that a fixed cost of $200 per year is sufficient to explain why nearly half of all U.S. households do not participate in the market. Participation rates have been shown to strongly correlate with education levels, promoting the hypothesis that information and transaction costs of market participation are better absorbed by more educated households. Behavioral economists Harrison Hong, Jeffrey Kubik and Jeremy Stein suggest that sociability and participation rates of communities have a statistically significant impact on an individual's decision to participate in the market. Their research indicates that social individuals living in states with higher than average participation rates are 5% more likely to participate than individuals that do not share those characteristics. This phenomenon also explained in cost terms. Knowledge of market functioning diffuses through communities and consequently lowers transaction costs associated with investing.\nHistory.\nIn 12th-century France, the courtiers \"de change\" were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt;s. The Italian historian Lodovico Guicciardini described how, in late 13th-century &lt;a href=\"Bruges\"&gt;Bruges&lt;/a&gt;, commodity traders gathered outdoors at a market square containing an inn owned by a family called \"Van der Beurze\", and in 1409 they became the \"Brugse Beurse\", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting. The idea quickly spread around &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; and neighboring countries and \"Beurzen\" soon opened in &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rotterdam\"&gt;Rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;. International traders, and specially the Italian bankers, present in Bruges since the early 13th-century, took back the word in their countries to define the place for stock market exchange: first the Italians (Borsa), but soon also the French (Bourse), the Germans (b\u00f6rse), Russians (bir\u017ea), Czechs (burza), Swedes (b\u00f6rs), Danes and Norwegians (b\u00f8rs). In most languages the word coincides with that for money bag, dating back to the Latin bursa, from which obviously also derives the name of the Van der Beurse family.\nIn the middle of the &lt;a href=\"13th%20century\"&gt;13th century&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venetian&lt;/a&gt; bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in &lt;a href=\"Pisa\"&gt;Pisa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Verona\"&gt;Verona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Genoa\"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt; also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century. Around this time, a &lt;a href=\"joint%20stock%20company\"&gt;joint stock company&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one whose stock is owned jointly by the shareholders\u2014emerged and became important for colonization of what Europeans called the \"New World\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20East%20India%20Company\"&gt;Dutch East India Company&lt;/a&gt; (founded in 1602) was the first &lt;a href=\"joint-stock%20company\"&gt;joint-stock company&lt;/a&gt; to get a fixed capital stock and as a result, continuous trade in company stock occurred on the Amsterdam Exchange. Soon thereafter, a lively trade in various &lt;a href=\"Derivative%20%28finance%29\"&gt;derivatives&lt;/a&gt;, among which options and repos, emerged on the &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam\"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; market. Dutch traders also pioneered &lt;a href=\"Short%20%28finance%29\"&gt;short selling&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 a practice which was banned by the Dutch authorities as early as 1610.\nThere are now stock markets in virtually every developed and most developing economies, with the world's largest markets being in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, China, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, Germany (&lt;a href=\"Frankfurt%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;Frankfurt Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;), France, &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nImportance.\nFunction and purpose.\nThe stock market is one of the most important ways for &lt;a href=\"Company\"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; to raise money, along with debt markets which are generally more imposing but do not trade publicly. This allows businesses to be publicly traded, and raise additional financial capital for expansion by selling shares of ownership of the company in a public market. The &lt;a href=\"Market%20liquidity\"&gt;liquidity&lt;/a&gt; that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as &lt;a href=\"property\"&gt;property&lt;/a&gt; and other immoveable assets.\nHistory has shown that the price of &lt;a href=\"stock\"&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt;s and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood. An economy where the stock market is on the rise is considered to be an up-and-coming economy. The stock market is often considered the primary indicator of a country's economic strength and development.\nRising share prices, for instance, tend to be associated with increased business investment and vice versa. Share prices also affect the wealth of households and their consumption. Therefore, &lt;a href=\"central%20bank\"&gt;central bank&lt;/a&gt;s tend to keep an eye on the control and behavior of the stock market and, in general, on the smooth operation of &lt;a href=\"financial%20system\"&gt;financial system&lt;/a&gt; functions. Financial stability is the &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Araison%20d%27%C3%AAtre\"&gt;raison d'\u00eatre&lt;/a&gt; of central banks.\nExchanges also act as the clearinghouse for each transaction, meaning that they collect and deliver the shares, and guarantee payment to the seller of a security. This eliminates the risk to an individual buyer or seller that the &lt;a href=\"counterparty\"&gt;counterparty&lt;/a&gt; could default on the transaction.\nThe smooth functioning of all these activities facilitates &lt;a href=\"economic%20growth\"&gt;economic growth&lt;/a&gt; in that lower costs and enterprise risks promote the production of goods and services as well as possibly employment. In this way the financial system is assumed to contribute to increased prosperity, although some controversy exists as to whether the optimal financial system is bank-based or market-based.\nRecent events such as the &lt;a href=\"Global%20Financial%20Crisis\"&gt;Global Financial Crisis&lt;/a&gt; have prompted a heightened degree of scrutiny of the impact of the structure of stock markets (called &lt;a href=\"market%20microstructure\"&gt;market microstructure&lt;/a&gt;), in particular to the stability of the financial system and the transmission of &lt;a href=\"systemic%20risk\"&gt;systemic risk&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelation to the modern financial system.\nA transformation is the move to &lt;a href=\"electronic%20trading\"&gt;electronic trading&lt;/a&gt; to replace human trading of listed &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28finance%29\"&gt;securities&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior of stock prices.\nChanges in stock prices are mostly caused by external factors such as &lt;a href=\"Socioeconomics\"&gt;socioeconomic&lt;/a&gt; conditions, inflation, exchange rates. &lt;a href=\"Intellectual%20capital\"&gt;Intellectual capital&lt;/a&gt; does not affect a company stock's current earnings. &lt;a href=\"Intellectual%20capital\"&gt;Intellectual capital&lt;/a&gt; contributes to a stock's return growth. \nThe &lt;a href=\"efficient-market%20hypothesis\"&gt;efficient-market hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; (EMH) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information at the current time.\nThe 'hard' &lt;a href=\"efficient-market%20hypothesis\"&gt;efficient-market hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; does not explain the cause of events such as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Monday%20%281987%29\"&gt;crash in 1987&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Dow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average\"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; plummeted 22.6 percent\u2014the largest-ever one-day fall in the United States.\nThis event demonstrated that share prices can fall dramatically even though no generally agreed upon definite cause has been found: a thorough search failed to detect \"any\" 'reasonable' development that might have accounted for the crash. (Note that such events are predicted to occur strictly by &lt;a href=\"randomness\"&gt;randomness&lt;/a&gt;, although very rarely.) It seems also to be true more generally that many price movements (beyond those which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are \"not\" occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.\nA 'soft' EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants cannot \"systematically\" profit from any momentary '&lt;a href=\"market%20anomaly\"&gt;market anomaly&lt;/a&gt;'. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e. non-trending), many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and &lt;a href=\"value%20at%20risk\"&gt;value at risk&lt;/a&gt; limits, \"theoretically could\" cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).\nOther research has shown that psychological factors may result in \"exaggerated\" (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just \"noise\", e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context, this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.\nAnother phenomenon\u2014also from psychology\u2014that works against an &lt;a href=\"objectivity%20%28philosophy%29\"&gt;objective&lt;/a&gt; assessment is \"&lt;a href=\"Groupthink\"&gt;group thinking&lt;/a&gt;\". As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of a majority of the group. An example with which one may be familiar is the reluctance to enter a restaurant that is empty; people generally prefer to have their opinion validated by those of others in the group.\nIn one paper the authors draw an analogy with &lt;a href=\"gambling\"&gt;gambling&lt;/a&gt;. In normal times the market behaves like a game of &lt;a href=\"roulette\"&gt;roulette&lt;/a&gt;; the probabilities are known and largely independent of the investment decisions of the different players. In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.\nIn the period running up to the 1987 crash, less than 1 percent of the analysts' recommendations had been to sell (and even during the 2000\u20132002 &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Market\"&gt;bear market&lt;/a&gt;, the average did not rise above 5%). In the run-up to 2000, the media amplified the general euphoria, with reports of rapidly rising share prices and the notion that large sums of money could be quickly earned in the so-called &lt;a href=\"new%20economy\"&gt;new economy&lt;/a&gt; stock market.\nStock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively.\nEconomic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends. Macroeconomic trends include such as changes in GDP, unemployment rates, national income, price indices, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, saving, investment, energy, international trade, immigration, productivity, aging populations, innovations, international finance. increasing corporate profit, increasing profit margins, higher concentration of business, lower company income, less vigorous activity, less progress, lower investment rates, lower productivity growth, less employee share of corporate revenues, decreasing Worker to Beneficiary ratio (year 1960 5:1, year 2009 3:1, year 2030 2.2:1), increasing female to male ratio college graduates.\nMany different academic researchers have stated that companies with low P/E ratios and smaller-sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market. Research has shown that mid-sized companies outperform large cap companies, and smaller companies have higher returns historically.\nIrrational behavior.\nSometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself. However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counter reaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected. Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, &lt;a href=\"euphoria\"&gt;euphoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mass%20panic\"&gt;mass panic&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.\nBehaviorists argue that investors often behave \"irrationally\" when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money. However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.\nCrashes.\nA stock market crash is often defined as a sharp dip in &lt;a href=\"share%20price\"&gt;share price&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"stock\"&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt;s listed on the stock exchanges. In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative &lt;a href=\"economic%20bubble\"&gt;economic bubble&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere have been famous &lt;a href=\"stock%20market%20crash\"&gt;stock market crash&lt;/a&gt;es that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the &lt;a href=\"social%20security\"&gt;social security&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"retirement%20plan\"&gt;retirement plan&lt;/a&gt;s are being increasingly privatized and linked to &lt;a href=\"stock\"&gt;stock&lt;/a&gt;s and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the &lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929\"&gt;Wall Street Crash of 1929&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"stock%20market%20crash%20of%201973%E2%80%934\"&gt;stock market crash of 1973\u20134&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Monday%20%281987%29\"&gt;Black Monday of 1987&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dot-com%20bubble\"&gt;Dot-com bubble&lt;/a&gt; of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n1929.\nOne of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The &lt;a href=\"Dow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average\"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;.\n1987.\nAnother famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 \u2013 Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.\nBy the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history \u2013 the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names \"Black Monday\" and \"Black Tuesday\" are also used for October 28\u201329, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday\u2014the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.\nThe crash in 1987 raised some puzzles \u2013 main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the &lt;a href=\"theory%20of%20rational%20conduct%20of%20human%20being\"&gt;theory of rational human conduct&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"theory%20of%20market%20equilibrium\"&gt;theory of market equilibrium&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"efficient-market%20hypothesis\"&gt;efficient-market hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Reserve%20System\"&gt;Federal Reserve System&lt;/a&gt; and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.\n2007-2009.\nThis marked the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Recession\"&gt;Great Recession&lt;/a&gt;. Starting in 2007 and lasting through 2009, financial markets experienced one of the sharpest declines in decades. It was more widespread than just the stock market as well. The housing market, lending market, and even global trade experienced unimaginable decline. Sub-prime lending led to the housing bubble bursting and was made famous by movies like &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Short%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Big Short&lt;/a&gt; where those holding large mortgages were unwittingly falling prey to lenders. This saw banks and major financial institutions completely fail in many cases and took major government intervention to remedy during the period. From October 2007 to March 2009, the S&amp;P 500 fell 57% and wouldn't recover to its 2007 levels until April 2013.\n2020.\nThe 2020 stock market crash was a major and sudden global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 and ended on 7 April.\nCircuit breakers.\nSince the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange\"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Mercantile%20Exchange\"&gt;Chicago Mercantile Exchange&lt;/a&gt; introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.\nStock market index.\nThe movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g. the &lt;a href=\"Standard%20%26amp%3B%20Poor%27s\"&gt;S&amp;P&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"FTSE%20100%20Index\"&gt;FTSE&lt;/a&gt; ,the &lt;a href=\"Euronext\"&gt;Euronext&lt;/a&gt; indices and the &lt;a href=\"BANKNIFTY\"&gt;NIFTY &amp; SENSEX&lt;/a&gt; of India. Such indices are usually &lt;a href=\"market%20capitalization\"&gt;market capitalization&lt;/a&gt; weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.\nDerivative instruments.\nFinancial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are &lt;a href=\"exchange-traded%20fund\"&gt;exchange-traded fund&lt;/a&gt;s (ETFs), &lt;a href=\"stock%20index\"&gt;stock index&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stock%20option\"&gt;stock option&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"equity%20swap\"&gt;equity swap&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"single-stock%20futures\"&gt;single-stock futures&lt;/a&gt;, and stock index &lt;a href=\"futures%20contract\"&gt;futures&lt;/a&gt;. These last two may be traded on &lt;a href=\"futures%20exchange\"&gt;futures exchange&lt;/a&gt;s (which are distinct from stock exchanges\u2014their history traces back to &lt;a href=\"commodity\"&gt;commodity&lt;/a&gt; futures exchanges), or traded &lt;a href=\"Over-the-counter%20%28finance%29\"&gt;over-the-counter&lt;/a&gt;. As all of these products are only \"&lt;a href=\"Derivative%20%28finance%29\"&gt;derived&lt;/a&gt;\" from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) &lt;a href=\"derivatives%20market\"&gt;derivatives market&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\nLeveraged strategies.\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using &lt;a href=\"short%20selling\"&gt;short selling&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"margin%20buying\"&gt;margin buying&lt;/a&gt; may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, \"&lt;a href=\"derivative%20%28finance%29\"&gt;derivatives&lt;/a&gt;\" may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\nShort selling.\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering\". This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of &lt;a href=\"naked%20shorting\"&gt;naked shorting&lt;/a&gt; is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\nMargin buying.\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Reserve\"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt;) was implemented after the &lt;a href=\"Crash%20of%201929\"&gt;Crash of 1929&lt;/a&gt;. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total &lt;a href=\"investment\"&gt;investment&lt;/a&gt; represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of \"free-riding:\" putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\nTypes of financial markets.\nFinancial markets can be divided into different subtypes:\nInvestment strategies.\nMany strategies can be classified as either &lt;a href=\"fundamental%20analysis\"&gt;fundamental analysis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"technical%20analysis\"&gt;technical analysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fundamental%20analysis\"&gt;Fundamental analysis&lt;/a&gt; refers to analyzing companies by their &lt;a href=\"financial%20statement\"&gt;financial statement&lt;/a&gt;s found in &lt;a href=\"SEC%20filing\"&gt;SEC filing&lt;/a&gt;s, business trends, and general economic conditions. &lt;a href=\"Technical%20analysis\"&gt;Technical analysis&lt;/a&gt; studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the &lt;a href=\"Trend%20following\"&gt;Trend following&lt;/a&gt; method, used by &lt;a href=\"John%20W.%20Henry\"&gt;John W. Henry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Seykota\"&gt;Ed Seykota&lt;/a&gt;, which uses price patterns and is also rooted in &lt;a href=\"risk%20management\"&gt;risk management&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"diversification%20%28finance%29\"&gt;diversification&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via passive &lt;a href=\"index%20fund\"&gt;index fund&lt;/a&gt;s. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the &lt;a href=\"S%26amp%3BP%20500%20Index\"&gt;S&amp;P 500 Index&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wilshire%205000\"&gt;Wilshire 5000&lt;/a&gt;). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of &lt;a href=\"fundamental%20analysis\"&gt;fundamental analysis&lt;/a&gt; only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. &lt;a href=\"Socially%20responsible%20investing\"&gt;Socially responsible investing&lt;/a&gt; is another investment preference.\nTaxation.\nTaxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a &lt;a href=\"capital%20gains%20tax\"&gt;capital gains tax&lt;/a&gt;. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as \"double taxation\"."
