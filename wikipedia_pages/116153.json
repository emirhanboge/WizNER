    "text": "Brownville is a &lt;a href=\"New%20England%20town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Piscataquis%20County%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Piscataquis County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maine\"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The population was 1,139 at the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2020 census&lt;/a&gt;. The town includes the villages of Brownville, Knight's Landing and &lt;a href=\"Brownville%20Junction%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Brownville Junction&lt;/a&gt;, near which passes the &lt;a href=\"100-Mile%20Wilderness\"&gt;100-Mile Wilderness&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Appalachian%20Trail\"&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe area was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Waldo%20Patent\"&gt;Waldo Patent&lt;/a&gt; purchased by Moses Brown and Major Josiah Hill of &lt;a href=\"Newburyport%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Newburyport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, who initiated its settlement. In 1806, they built a &lt;a href=\"dam\"&gt;dam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"watermill\"&gt;watermill&lt;/a&gt;s on the &lt;a href=\"Pleasant%20River%20%28Piscataquis%20River%29\"&gt;Pleasant River&lt;/a&gt;. First known as township T5 R8 NWP, the community was organized in 1819 as Brownville Plantation. It was named for Francis Brown (nephew of Moses Brown), who was a mill owner and trader from &lt;a href=\"Newbury%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Newbury&lt;/a&gt;, Massachusetts. In 1824, the town was incorporated as Brownville.\nEarly settlers were given to clear and cultivate. Farms produced &lt;a href=\"hay\"&gt;hay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oats\"&gt;oats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potatoes\"&gt;potatoes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; and garden &lt;a href=\"vegetables\"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Water%20power\"&gt;Water power&lt;/a&gt; from the Pleasant River attracted industry, including &lt;a href=\"sawmill\"&gt;sawmill&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Clapboard%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;clapboard&lt;/a&gt; mills, &lt;a href=\"gristmill\"&gt;gristmill&lt;/a&gt;s, a shovel handle factory and a &lt;a href=\"carriage\"&gt;carriage&lt;/a&gt; factory. &lt;a href=\"Quarry\"&gt;Quarries&lt;/a&gt; were established to extract the region's abundant &lt;a href=\"slate\"&gt;slate&lt;/a&gt;, the quality of which won first prize at the 1876 &lt;a href=\"Centennial%20Exposition\"&gt;Centennial Exposition&lt;/a&gt;. In 1843, the Bangor &amp; Piscataquis Slate Company opened with 60 employees. It sent out 8,000-12,000 squares of roofing slate annually. The Merrill Quarry opened in 1846 with about 80 employees, producing 30,000 squares of roofing slate annually. The Highland Quarry opened with &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20people\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; employees, recruited because they were accustomed to working in slate. The last quarry closed in 1917.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20ore\"&gt;Iron ore&lt;/a&gt; was discovered at the foot of Ore Mountain. The &lt;a href=\"Katahdin%20Iron%20Works\"&gt;Katahdin Iron Works&lt;/a&gt; was established in 1843, when roads were cut out and a &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt; erected. A hotel and several houses were built for workers. &lt;a href=\"Charcoal\"&gt;Charcoal&lt;/a&gt; was made in 14 &lt;a href=\"kiln\"&gt;kiln&lt;/a&gt;s, consuming 10,000 &lt;a href=\"cord%20%28unit%20of%20volume%29\"&gt;cords&lt;/a&gt; of wood per year. The company and land were sold in 1845, and the new owners operated it until 1856, the year it produced 2350 tons of iron. However, shipping it to &lt;a href=\"Bangor%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Bangor&lt;/a&gt; was expensive. The &lt;a href=\"Bangor%20and%20Katahdin%20Iron%20Works%20Railway\"&gt;Bangor and Katahdin Iron Works Railway&lt;/a&gt; (B&amp;KIW) was constructed to Brownville in 1881, then connected north to the Katahdin Iron Works in 1883.\nIn 1889 the &lt;a href=\"International%20Railway%20of%20Maine\"&gt;International Railway of Maine&lt;/a&gt; was constructed by its owner &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway\"&gt;Canadian Pacific Railway&lt;/a&gt; (CPR), extending the CPR's transcontinental mainline east from &lt;a href=\"Montreal\"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quebec\"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20John%2C%20New%20Brunswick\"&gt;Saint John, New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt;. The CPR line passed 3 miles north of Brownville, where it crossed the B&amp;KIW at a location that was named &lt;a href=\"Brownville%20Junction%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Brownville Junction&lt;/a&gt;. In 1891 the B&amp;KIW merged into the &lt;a href=\"Bangor%20and%20Aroostook%20Railroad\"&gt;Bangor and Aroostook Railroad&lt;/a&gt; (BAR) after the Katahdin Iron Works closed the previous year. The BAR line as well as the CPR line west of Brownville became part of the &lt;a href=\"Montreal%2C%20Maine%20and%20Atlantic%20Railway\"&gt;Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway&lt;/a&gt; and are now part of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Maine%20and%20Qu%C3%A9bec%20Railway\"&gt;Central Maine and Qu\u00e9bec Railway&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway\"&gt;Canadian Pacific Railway&lt;/a&gt; purchased the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Maine%20and%20Qu%C3%A9bec%20Railway\"&gt;Central Maine and Qu\u00e9bec Railway&lt;/a&gt;, once again, giving the railway access to the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Saint%20John\"&gt;Port of Saint John&lt;/a&gt; running trains from &lt;a href=\"Brownville%20Junction%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Brownville Junction&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"New%20Brunswick\"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"New%20Brunswick%20Southern%20Railway\"&gt;New Brunswick Southern Railway&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocal historian Bill Sawtell has documented many facets of the history of Brownville as well as the surrounding area. He has published numerous books with subjects such as Katahdin Iron Works, the Highland Quarry, the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad, and &lt;a href=\"Penquis%20Valley%20High%20School\"&gt;Penquis Valley High School&lt;/a&gt; basketball.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Situated between Sebec and Schoodic lakes, Brownville is drained by the &lt;a href=\"Pleasant%20River%20%28Piscataquis%20River%29\"&gt;Pleasant River&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nThis &lt;a href=\"climate\"&gt;climatic&lt;/a&gt; region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters.
