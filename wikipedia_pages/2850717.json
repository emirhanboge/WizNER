    "text": "Major League Cricket was a New York based company dedicated to running a professional &lt;a href=\"cricket\"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; competition within the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, as well as developing and promoting the sport to raise its profile in &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;. MLC was not recognized by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20of%20America%20Cricket%20Association\"&gt;United States of America Cricket Association&lt;/a&gt; (USACA), and thus had no official status within the recognized &lt;a href=\"international%20structure%20of%20cricket\"&gt;international structure of cricket&lt;/a&gt;.\nMLC formed in New Jersey in 2000, with the explicit goals of developing &lt;a href=\"grassroots\"&gt;grassroots&lt;/a&gt; support for young cricketers in the U.S. and leading up to professional competitiveness at the international level. During its early years, MLC was stifled from achieving much within the organization of cricket by USACA. However, with the increasing disruption to U.S. cricket administration caused by political turmoil within USACA, the overall structure of U.S. cricket began to break down, allowing MLC to step into the fray and begin organizing its own events.\nWith the collapse of the ambitious &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Cricket\"&gt;Pro Cricket&lt;/a&gt; league following its maiden, and only, season in 2004, MLC became a major player in the complex political situation in which American cricket found itself. In February 2006, MLC approached the &lt;a href=\"International%20Cricket%20Council\"&gt;International Cricket Council&lt;/a&gt; with a formal request to recognize it as the official governing body of cricket in the USA, in preference to USACA. The request was eventually turned down by the ICC. In 2017, the USACA was expelled by the ICC due to governance issues.\nUnder-15 Tournament.\nOn June 7, 2005, MLC announced an under-15 tournament in &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, to be played that August, as part of its program of youth cricket development. Italian sporting goods manufacturer L-SPORTO sponsored the competition. However, in July the tournament was first moved to &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, and then cancelled, with MLC citing \"logistical problems\" as the reason. The \"USA Cricket Academy\" headed by Ashok Patel, and Major League Cricket, both based in New Jersey also formed an alliance to develop a New jersey under 13 tournament.\nSir Clive Lloyd Cup.\nMLC announced a new National Interstate Cricket Cup tournament, to be held in November 2005 in &lt;a href=\"Broward%20County%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Broward County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, under the patronage of former &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies%20cricket%20team\"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt; captain and &lt;a href=\"International%20Cricket%20Council\"&gt;International Cricket Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"match%20referee\"&gt;match referee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clive%20Lloyd\"&gt;Sir Clive Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;. Due to &lt;a href=\"Hurricane%20Wilma\"&gt;Hurricane Wilma&lt;/a&gt;, it was postponed to the end of November, eventually being played between 30 November and 4 December.\nTeams representing the states of &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; played in the inaugural tournament. The tournament included two divisions, one for senior players, and one for players under the age of 25. Former West Indian opening batsman &lt;a href=\"Desmond%20Haynes\"&gt;Desmond Haynes&lt;/a&gt; will be involved with coaching national U.S. youth and senior teams selected during the tournament.\nUnited States Cricket Development Program.\nIn July 2005, MLC announced an ambitious 10-year program for the development of domestic competition and international level cricket skills within the U.S. The program developed by Bernard Cameron and expanded by former 1st class players Robert Smith and Desmond Haynes, includes plans to establish National Cricket Centres to encourage local development, a National Cricket Academy, and certification of cricket coaches and &lt;a href=\"umpire%20%28cricket%29\"&gt;umpires&lt;/a&gt;. MLC has stated the goal of preparing a U.S. team capable of qualifying for the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Cricket%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2011 Cricket World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother part of the development program was the establishment of world class cricket playing facilities in the U.S. To this end, MLC met with &lt;a href=\"The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company\"&gt;The Walt Disney Company&lt;/a&gt; and convinced them to pledge over of land in Florida for the construction of a custom multi-function cricket and &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;soccer&lt;/a&gt; stadium.\nProfessional Twenty20 league.\nIn September 2005, MLC announced plans to launch a professional eight team &lt;a href=\"Twenty20\"&gt;Twenty20&lt;/a&gt; league in the U.S., with a first season to have been played in 2007. Players for the tournament were to have been recruited from the state-based teams represented in the Sir Clive Lloyd Cup."
