He is well known for his defensive pressure on other defenders to force them to make mistakes. Suzuki was nicknamed the \"Japanese Blond Bomber\" because of his blond-dyed hair (the original blond bomber was legendary German striker &lt;a href=\"J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann\"&gt;J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann&lt;/a&gt;). As the result of world record about consecutive no goals, Japanese call Suzuki as 'Master No Goal'."
