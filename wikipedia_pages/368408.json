    "text": "The 1383\u20131385 Portuguese interregnum was a &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20history\"&gt;Portuguese history&lt;/a&gt; during which no crowned &lt;a href=\"king%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;king of Portugal&lt;/a&gt; reigned. The &lt;a href=\"interregnum\"&gt;interregnum&lt;/a&gt; began when King &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Ferdinand I&lt;/a&gt; died without a male &lt;a href=\"heir\"&gt;heir&lt;/a&gt; and ended when King &lt;a href=\"John%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;John I&lt;/a&gt; was crowned in 1385 after his victory during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Aljubarrota\"&gt;Battle of Aljubarrota&lt;/a&gt;.\nPortuguese interpret the era as their earliest national resistance movement countering Castilian intervention, and Robert Durand considers it as the \"great revealer of &lt;a href=\"national%20consciousness\"&gt;national consciousness&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe bourgeoisie and the nobility worked together to establish the &lt;a href=\"Aviz%20dynasty\"&gt;Aviz dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, a branch of the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20House%20of%20Burgundy\"&gt;Portuguese House of Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;, securely on an independent throne. That contrasted with the lengthy civil wars in France (&lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years' War&lt;/a&gt;) and England (&lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;War of the Roses&lt;/a&gt;), which had aristocratic factions fighting powerfully against a centralised monarchy.\nIt is usually known in Portugal as the 1383-1385 Crisis (\"Crise de 1383-1385\").\nBackground.\nIn 1383, King &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20I%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Ferdinand I of Portugal&lt;/a&gt; was dying. From his marriage to &lt;a href=\"Leonor%20Telles%20de%20Menezes\"&gt;Leonor Telles de Menezes&lt;/a&gt; only a girl, Princess &lt;a href=\"Beatrice%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Beatrice of Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, survived. Her marriage was the major political issue of the day since it would determine the future of the kingdom.\nSeveral political factions lobbied for possible husbands, which included &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; princes. Finally, the king settled for his wife's first choice, King &lt;a href=\"John%20I%20of%20Castile\"&gt;John I of Castile&lt;/a&gt;. Ferdinand had waged three wars against Castile during his reign, and the marriage, celebrated in May 1383, was intended to put an end to hostilities by a union of the two crowns, but that was not a widely-accepted solution. The &lt;a href=\"dynastic%20union\"&gt;dynastic union&lt;/a&gt; meant that Portugal would lose independence to Castile. Many nobles were fiercely opposed to that possibility but were not united under a common pretender to the crown. There were two candidates, both illegitimate half-brothers of Ferdinand:\nOn October 22, 1383, King Ferdinand died. According to the &lt;a href=\"marriage%20contract\"&gt;marriage contract&lt;/a&gt;, Dowager Queen Leonor assumed regency in the name of her daughter Beatrice and son-in-law, John I of Castile. Since diplomatic opposition was no longer possible, the party for independence took more drastic measures, which started the 1383\u20131385 crisis.\n1383.\nThe regent's privy council made the error of excluding any representation of the merchants of Lisbon. On the other hand, the popular classes of Lisbon, Beja, Porto, \u00c9vora, Estremoz, Portalegre and some other municipalities of the kingdom rose in favour of John (Jo\u00e3o), Master of Avis, seeing him as the national candidate (and the preferred national candidate). The first move was taken by the faction of John of Aviz in December 1383. Jo\u00e3o Fernandes Andeiro, Count of Our\u00e9m, called Conde Andeiro, the detested lover of the dowager queen, was murdered by a group of conspirators led by Jo\u00e3o of Aviz. Following this act, John, acclaimed \"rector and defender of the realm\" by the people of Lisbon, and also supported by the city great merchants, was now the leader of the opposition to the pretensions of John I of Castile, who tried to be recognised as monarch &lt;a href=\"iure%20uxoris\"&gt;iure uxoris&lt;/a&gt;, against the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Salvaterra\"&gt;Treaty of Salvaterra&lt;/a&gt;.\n1384.\nThe armed resistance met the Castilian army on April 6, 1384, in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Atoleiros\"&gt;Battle of Atoleiros&lt;/a&gt;. General Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira won the battle for the Aviz party, but victory was not decisive. John I of Castile then retreated to Lisbon in May and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Lisbon%20%281384%29\"&gt;besieged the capital&lt;/a&gt;, with an auxiliary fleet blocking the city's port in the river &lt;a href=\"Tagus\"&gt;Tagus&lt;/a&gt;, in a severe drawback to the independence cause. Without the capital and its riches and commerce, little could be done to free the country from the Castilian king. On his side, John I of Castile needed Lisbon, not only for financial reasons, but also for political ones\u2014neither he nor Beatrice had been crowned as monarchs of Portugal, and without a coronation in the capital he was only a designated king.\nMeanwhile, John of Aviz had surrendered the military command of the resistance to Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira. The general continued to attack cities loyal to the Castilians and to harass the invading army. John of Aviz was now focused on diplomatic offensives. International politics played an important role in deciding Portuguese affairs. In 1384, the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years' War&lt;/a&gt; was at its peak, with &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; forces in a struggle for the crown of France. The conflict spilled beyond the French borders, and influenced, for instance, the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Schism\"&gt;Western Schism&lt;/a&gt; in a papacy only recently moved to Avignon from Rome. Castile was a traditional ally of France, so, looking for assistance in England was the natural option for John of Aviz. In May, with Lisbon under siege, an embassy was sent to &lt;a href=\"Richard%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Richard II of England&lt;/a&gt; to make a case for Portuguese independence. Richard was seventeen years old in 1384, and power lay with his uncle &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Gaunt%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; and regent of England. Despite initial reluctance to concede men, John of Gaunt finally agreed to levy troops to reinforce the Portuguese army.\nLisbon was struggling with &lt;a href=\"famine\"&gt;famine&lt;/a&gt; and feared defeat by the Castilian &lt;a href=\"siege\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt;. Blocked by land and by the river, the city had no hope of relief by the Aviz army, which was too small to risk an intervention and was occupied subduing other cities. An attempt was made by a Portuguese fleet to relieve the Castilian blockade. On July 18 a group of ships led by captain Rui Pereira managed to &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Battle%20of%20the%20Tejo\"&gt;break the blockade&lt;/a&gt; and deliver precious supplies of food to Lisbon. The cost was high, since three of four boats were seized and Rui Pereira himself died in the naval combat. Despite this minor success, the siege held on; the city of &lt;a href=\"Almada\"&gt;Almada&lt;/a&gt; on the south bank of the Tagus surrendered to Castile. But the siege was hard not only on the inhabitants of Lisbon: the army of Castile was also dealing with a shortage of food supplies, due to the harassment of Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira, and the &lt;a href=\"bubonic%20plague\"&gt;bubonic plague&lt;/a&gt;. It was the outbreak of an epidemic in his ranks that forced John I of Castile to raise the siege on September 3 and retreat to Castile. Weeks later, the Castilian fleet also abandoned the Tagus, and Lisbon avoided conquest.\n1385.\nIn late 1384 and the early months of 1385, Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira and John of Aviz pursued the war, but they did not manage to subdue the majority of those Portuguese cities then in favour of the Castilian cause. Answering the call for help, English troops (an Anglo-Gascon contingent) landed in Portugal on &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Day\"&gt;Easter Day&lt;/a&gt;. They were not a big contingent, around 600 men (of which about 100 would be present in Ajubarrota), but they were mainly veterans of the Hundred Years' War battles and thereby well schooled in successful English military tactics. Among them were a small number of &lt;a href=\"English%20longbow\"&gt;longbowmen&lt;/a&gt; who had already demonstrated their value against cavalry charges.\nAt the same time, John of Aviz organised a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Coimbra\"&gt;Coimbra&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Cortes\"&gt;Cortes&lt;/a&gt;\", the assembly of the kingdom. There, on April 6, he was proclaimed the tenth king of Portugal, a clear act of defiance against the Castilian pretensions. John I of Portugal nominated Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira &lt;a href=\"Constable%20of%20Portugal\"&gt;Constable of Portugal&lt;/a&gt; and went to subdue the resistance still surviving in the north.\nJohn I of Castile was not pleased. His first move was to send a &lt;a href=\"punitive%20expedition\"&gt;punitive expedition&lt;/a&gt;, but the forces were heavily defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Trancoso\"&gt;Battle of Trancoso&lt;/a&gt; in May. From January, he began preparing his army to solve the problem definitively. The king himself led an enormous Castilian army that invaded Portugal in the second week of June through the central north, from &lt;a href=\"Celorico%20da%20Beira\"&gt;Celorico da Beira&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Coimbra\"&gt;Coimbra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leiria\"&gt;Leiria&lt;/a&gt;. An allied contingent of French heavy cavalry travelled with them. The power of numbers was on their side\u2014about 32,000 men on the Castilian side versus 6,500 on the Portuguese. They immediately headed to the region of Lisbon and Santar\u00e9m, the country's major cities.\nMeanwhile, the armies of John I of Portugal and Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira joined together in the city of &lt;a href=\"Tomar\"&gt;Tomar&lt;/a&gt;. After some debate, a decision was made: the Castilians could not be allowed to besiege Lisbon once again, since the city would undoubtedly fall, so the Portuguese would intercept the enemy in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Leiria\"&gt;Leiria&lt;/a&gt;, near the village of Aljubarrota. On August 14, the Castilian army, very slow due to its huge numbers, finally met the Portuguese and English troops. The ensuing fight, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Aljubarrota\"&gt;Battle of Aljubarrota&lt;/a&gt;, was fought in the style of the Battles of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy\"&gt;Cr\u00e9cy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Poitiers%20%281356%29\"&gt;Poitiers&lt;/a&gt;. These tactics allowed a reduced infantry army to defeat cavalrymen with the use of longbowmen in the flanks and defensive structures (like &lt;a href=\"caltrop\"&gt;caltrop&lt;/a&gt;s) in the front. The Castilian army was not only defeated, but annihilated. Their losses were so great that John I of Castile was prevented from attempting another invasion in the following years.\nLegacy.\nWith this victory, John of Aviz was recognised as the undisputed king of Portugal as John 1, putting an end to the \"&lt;a href=\"interregnum\"&gt;interregnum&lt;/a&gt;\" and anarchy of the 1383\u20131385 crisis. Recognition from Castile would not arrive until 1411, after another Portuguese victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Valverde%20%281385%29\"&gt;Battle of Valverde&lt;/a&gt;, with the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Ayll%C3%B3n\"&gt;Treaty of Ayll\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;. The English\u2013Portuguese alliance would be renewed in 1386 with the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Windsor%201386\"&gt;Treaty of Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and the marriage of John I to &lt;a href=\"Philippa%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;Philippa of Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of John of Gaunt. In 1387, taking advantage of the renewed alliance, John I, leading a Portuguese army of 9,000 men, reinforced by a 1,500-man English contingent that landed in &lt;a href=\"Galicia%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;Galicia&lt;/a&gt;, invaded Castile to sit John of Gaunt on the Castilian throne, which he claimed on his marriage to &lt;a href=\"Infanta%20Constance%20of%20Castile\"&gt;Infanta Constance of Castile&lt;/a&gt;. The Castilian forces refused to offer battle, after two months no significant town was taken and the allies, struck by disease and lack of supplies, met with an overwhelming failure.\nThe treaty, still valid today, established a pact of mutual support between the countries: Indeed, Portugal would use it again against its neighbours in 1640, to expel the Spanish Habsburg kings from the country, and again during the &lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20War\"&gt;Peninsular War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Portuguese%20Alliance\"&gt;Anglo-Portuguese Alliance&lt;/a&gt; would also be used by &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Succession%20of%20states\"&gt;succession&lt;/a&gt; from England) in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; (allowing the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allies&lt;/a&gt; to establish bases on the &lt;a href=\"Azores\"&gt;Azores&lt;/a&gt;) and during the 1982 &lt;a href=\"Falklands%20War\"&gt;Falklands War&lt;/a&gt;."
