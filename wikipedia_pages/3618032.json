    "text": "Rowdy is the official &lt;a href=\"mascot\"&gt;mascot&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League\"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Cowboys\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment and early years.\nRowdy was originally developed by &lt;a href=\"NFL%20Properties\"&gt;NFL Properties&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1990s as a &lt;a href=\"cowboy\"&gt;cowboy&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player character named \"Big D\" who was part of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20League%20Properties%23Team%20NFL%20Heroes%20.22mascot.22%20program\"&gt;Team NFL Heroes&lt;/a&gt; league-wide mascot program. Merchandise showing an early version of Rowdy with his name listed as Big D was marketed to children and teenagers during the &lt;a href=\"1994%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1995%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt; NFL seasons. Big D made public appearances at Cowboys games and other events as early as &lt;a href=\"1994%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt; but wasn't adopted by the Cowboys as their official mascot until 1996 after his name was changed to Rowdy and adjustments to his character design had been made.\nCharacter design and appearance.\nRowdy wears a Dallas Cowboys' football uniform combined with classic western attire including an oversized &lt;a href=\"cowboy%20hat\"&gt;cowboy hat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chaps\"&gt;chaps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cowboy%20boots\"&gt;cowboy boots&lt;/a&gt;. His jersey number is 00 (pronounced \"double zero\").\nRole as mascot.\nRowdy has been the Cowboys' official mascot since &lt;a href=\"1996%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;. His tenure overlapped with that of &lt;a href=\"Crazy%20Ray\"&gt;Crazy Ray&lt;/a&gt; who was the unofficial mascot of the Cowboys from &lt;a href=\"1962%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt; until his death in &lt;a href=\"2007%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;. As the Ambassador of the Dallas Cowboys, Rowdy's job includes, but is not limited to creating game day enthusiasm at AT&amp;T Stadium. He does this at home games by driving in on his four-wheeler, tossing t-shirts into the stands, using signs like \"Let's Go Cowboys,\" and mocking the opponents. Rowdy participates at every home game and selected away games.\nIn 2015, Rowdy was named \"Most Hated NFL Mascot\" by &lt;a href=\"Sports%20Illustrated\"&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommunity involvement.\nRowdy is involved with, takes part in, and/or makes appearances at the following: the Susan G. Komen &lt;a href=\"Race%20for%20the%20Cure\"&gt;Race for the Cure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Salvation%20Army\"&gt;The Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt;, The Rise School of Dallas, the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Olympics\"&gt;Special Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, retirement centers, hospitals, schools, birthday parties, grand openings, &lt;a href=\"Minor%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Minor League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; games around the country, conventions, parades, grocery store promotions, &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Mavericks\"&gt;Dallas Mavericks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"NBA\"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; games, weddings, and community events. He has even been to the &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt; at least three times: in &lt;a href=\"1994%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt; before being adopted by the Cowboys as their official mascot, and in &lt;a href=\"1998%20NFL%20season\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2000%20NFL%20season\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;. He has also taken part in televised events, including &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Alumni Beach Bowl\", &lt;a href=\"American%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Battle of the Gridiron\" and the Special Olympics.\nTraining camp promotions.\nAt Cowboys training camp Rowdy can be found playing with kids at Rowdy's Kid Zone. He takes the kids through obstacle courses and has them chant for their favorite Cowboys player during practice. Kids also visit the inflatable Cowboys Experience, which includes a bouncy house, slide, football toss, and field goal kick. Rowdy is known for squirting the kids with water guns, and anyone else who steps in his way like players, coaches, TV crews, and especially fans that come out to watch the Cowboys practice at camp. This is welcomed by fans when the outside temperature is 100 plus degrees.\nMascot convention participation.\nRowdy represents the Cowboys each year in selected cities for the annual mascot convention. At this event the NFL mascots compare and share ideas to help continue mascot antics and ways to market mascot awareness."
