    "text": "Schleswig-Holstein (; ; ; ) is the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Germany\"&gt;northernmost&lt;/a&gt; of the 16 &lt;a href=\"states%20of%20Germany\"&gt;states of Germany&lt;/a&gt;, comprising most of the historical duchy of &lt;a href=\"Holstein\"&gt;Holstein&lt;/a&gt; and the southern part of the former &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Schleswig\"&gt;Duchy of Schleswig&lt;/a&gt;. Its capital city is &lt;a href=\"Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt;; other notable cities are &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BCbeck\"&gt;L\u00fcbeck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flensburg\"&gt;Flensburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region is called in &lt;a href=\"Danish%20language\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; and pronounced . In more dated &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;, it is also known as \"Sleswick-Holsatia\". The &lt;a href=\"Low%20German\"&gt;Low German&lt;/a&gt; name is \"\", and the &lt;a href=\"North%20Frisian%20language\"&gt;North Frisian&lt;/a&gt; name is \"Slaswik-Holstiinj.\" Historically, the name can also refer to a larger region, containing both present-day Schleswig-Holstein and the former &lt;a href=\"South%20Jutland%20County\"&gt;South Jutland County&lt;/a&gt; (Northern Schleswig; now part of the &lt;a href=\"Region%20of%20Southern%20Denmark\"&gt;Region of Southern Denmark&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;.\nSchleswig was under Danish control during the &lt;a href=\"Viking%20Age\"&gt;Viking Age&lt;/a&gt;, but in the 12th century it escaped full control and became a duchy. It bordered Holstein, which was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning in 1460, both Schleswig and Holstein were ruled together by a single Duke. In the 19th century, Denmark and Prussia each believed they had a claim to Schleswig-Holstein, the population of which was majority ethnic German. The resulting long-term political and territorial dispute was known as the &lt;a href=\"Schleswig-Holstein%20Question\"&gt;Schleswig-Holstein Question&lt;/a&gt;. In 1848, Denmark tried to formally annex the area. Prussia responded by invading, thus beginning the &lt;a href=\"First%20Schleswig%20War\"&gt;First Schleswig War&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in a victory for Denmark and the signing of the &lt;a href=\"London%20Protocol%20%281852%29\"&gt;1852 London Protocol&lt;/a&gt;. But the fight broke out again in 1864 (the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Schleswig%20War\"&gt;Second Schleswig War&lt;/a&gt;), and this time Prussia won and the territory was absorbed into it. More than 50 years later, after the German defeat in World War I, the Allies required that the question of sovereignty over the territory be submitted to plebiscites (the &lt;a href=\"1920%20Schleswig%20plebiscites\"&gt;1920 Schleswig plebiscites&lt;/a&gt;), which resulted in the return of some of the territory to Denmark. \nAfter World War II, Schleswig-Holstein &lt;a href=\"Refugees%20in%20Schleswig-Holstein%20after%20the%20Second%20World%20War\"&gt;took in over a million refugees&lt;/a&gt;.\nToday, Schleswig-Holstein's economy is known for its agriculture, such as its &lt;a href=\"Holstein%20cow\"&gt;Holstein cow&lt;/a&gt;s. Its position on the Atlantic Ocean makes it a major trade point and shipbuilding site; it is also the location of the &lt;a href=\"Kiel%20Canal\"&gt;Kiel Canal&lt;/a&gt;. Its offshore oil wells and wind farms produce significant amounts of energy. Fishing is a major industry, and the basis of its distinctive unique local cuisine. It is a favorite tourist destination for Germans.\nHistory.\nThe term \"Holstein\" derives from &lt;a href=\"Old%20Saxon\"&gt;Old Saxon&lt;/a&gt; \"Holseta Land,\" (\"Holz\" means &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; in modern Standardized German; \"&lt;a href=\"Woodland\"&gt;holt&lt;/a&gt;\" is a now-archaic English word for woods.) Originally, the term referred to the central of the three &lt;a href=\"Saxons\"&gt;Saxon&lt;/a&gt; tribes north of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Elbe\"&gt;River Elbe&lt;/a&gt;: \"Tedmarsgoi\" (&lt;a href=\"Dithmarschen%20%28gau%29\"&gt;Dithmarschen&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Holstein\"&gt;Holstein&lt;/a&gt; and \"Sturmarii\" (&lt;a href=\"Stormarn%20%28gau%29\"&gt;Stormarn&lt;/a&gt;). The area inhabited by the tribe of the Holsts lay between the &lt;a href=\"St%C3%B6r\"&gt;St\u00f6r&lt;/a&gt; River and &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;; after &lt;a href=\"Christianization\"&gt;Christianization&lt;/a&gt;, their main &lt;a href=\"church%20%28building%29\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt; was in &lt;a href=\"Schenefeld%2C%20Steinburg\"&gt;Schenefeld&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Saxon&lt;/a&gt; Holstein became a part of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Charlemagne\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Saxon%20Wars\"&gt;Saxon campaigns&lt;/a&gt; in the late eighth century. Beginning in 811, the northern border of Holstein (and thus of the Empire) was the &lt;a href=\"Eider%20%28river%29\"&gt;River Eider&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term \u201cSchleswig\u201d originally referred to the city of &lt;a href=\"Schleswig%2C%20Schleswig-Holstein\"&gt;Schleswig&lt;/a&gt;. The city\u2019s name derives from &lt;a href=\"Schlei\"&gt;Schlei&lt;/a&gt; \u201c&lt;a href=\"inlet\"&gt;inlet&lt;/a&gt;\u201d in the east and \"vik\", which meant inlet in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt; and settlement in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Saxon\"&gt;Old Saxon&lt;/a&gt;, and is &lt;a href=\"cognate\"&gt;cognate&lt;/a&gt; with the \"-wick\" and \"-wich\" elements in place-names in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Schleswig\"&gt;Duchy of Schleswig&lt;/a&gt;, or Southern Jutland, was originally an integral part of Denmark, but in &lt;a href=\"medieval\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; times was established as a &lt;a href=\"fief\"&gt;fief&lt;/a&gt; under the control of the Kingdom of Denmark, having the same relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Danish%20Royal%20Family\"&gt;Danish Crown&lt;/a&gt; as, for example, &lt;a href=\"Brandenburg\"&gt;Brandenburg&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; had with the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Around 1100, the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Duke of Saxony&lt;/a&gt; gave Holstein to &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20I%20of%20Holstein\"&gt;Adolf I&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Schauenburg\"&gt;Schauenburg&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuchies in the Danish realm.\nSchleswig and Holstein have at different times belonged in part or completely to either Denmark or Germany, or have been virtually independent of both nations. Schleswig was never part of Germany until after the Second Schleswig War in 1864. But for many centuries, the king of Denmark was both a Danish Duke of Schleswig and a German Duke of Holstein. Essentially, Schleswig was either integrated into Denmark or was a Danish fief, and Holstein was a German fief and once, long before that, a sovereign state. Both were ruled for several centuries by the kings of Denmark. In 1721, all of Schleswig was united into a single duchy under the king of Denmark, and the great powers of Europe confirmed in an international treaty that all future kings of Denmark should automatically become dukes of Schleswig: consequently, Schleswig would always follow the order of succession that applied in the Kingdom of Denmark. Government business in both duchies was conducted in the German language, even though for a long time they were governed from Copenhagen. (Beginning in 1523, however, they were governed by the \"German Chancellery,\" which in 1806 was renamed the \"Schleswig-Holstein Chancellery\"). After the Protestant Reformation, church services were conducted in German in the southern part of Schleswig, and in Danish in the northern part. This difference would later contribute strongly to shaping the inhabitants\u2019 national sentiments, as would the different languages spoken in different schools after 1814, when mandatory schooling was instituted.\nSchleswig-Holstein Question.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nationalism\"&gt;German national awakening&lt;/a&gt; that followed the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt; gave rise to a strong popular movement in Holstein and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Schleswig\"&gt;Southern Schleswig&lt;/a&gt; for unification with a new &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;n-dominated Germany. This development was paralleled by an equally strong Danish national awakening in Denmark and Northern Schleswig. This movement called for the complete reintegration of Schleswig into the Kingdom of Denmark and demanded an end to discrimination against &lt;a href=\"Danes\"&gt;Danes&lt;/a&gt; in Schleswig. The ensuing conflict is sometimes called the &lt;a href=\"Schleswig-Holstein%20Question\"&gt;Schleswig-Holstein Question&lt;/a&gt;. In 1848, King &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20VII%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Frederick VII of Denmark&lt;/a&gt; declared that he would grant Denmark a liberal constitution and the immediate goal for the Danish national movement was to ensure that this constitution would give rights to all Danes, i.e. not only to those in the Kingdom of Denmark, but also to Danes (and Germans) living in Schleswig. Furthermore, they demanded protection for the Danish language in Schleswig (the dominant language in almost a quarter of Schleswig had changed from Danish to German since the beginning of the 19th century).\nA &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"constitution\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; for Holstein was not seriously considered in &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, since it was well known that the political &lt;a href=\"%C3%A9lite\"&gt;\u00e9lite&lt;/a&gt; of Holstein were more conservative than Copenhagen's. Representatives of German-minded Schleswig-Holsteiners demanded that Schleswig and Holstein be unified and allowed its own constitution and that Schleswig join Holstein as a member of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Confederation\"&gt;German Confederation&lt;/a&gt;. These demands were rejected by the Danish government in 1848, and the Germans of Holstein and southern Schleswig rebelled. This began the &lt;a href=\"First%20Schleswig%20War\"&gt;First Schleswig War&lt;/a&gt; (1848\u201351), which ended in a Danish victory at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Isted\"&gt;Idstedt&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1863, conflict broke out again when Frederick VII died without legitimate issue. According to the &lt;a href=\"order%20of%20succession\"&gt;order of succession&lt;/a&gt; of Denmark and Schleswig, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Duchy of &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Gl%C3%BCcksburg\"&gt;Gl\u00fccksburg&lt;/a&gt;, who became &lt;a href=\"Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Christian IX&lt;/a&gt;. The transmission of the duchy of Holstein to the head of the (German-oriented) branch of the Danish royal family, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg\"&gt;House of Augustenborg&lt;/a&gt;, was more controversial. The separation of the two duchies was challenged by the Augustenborg heir, who claimed, as in 1848, to be rightful heir of both Schleswig and Holstein. The promulgation of a common constitution for Denmark and Schleswig in November 1863 prompted &lt;a href=\"Otto%20von%20Bismarck\"&gt;Otto von Bismarck&lt;/a&gt; to intervene and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Empire\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; declared war on Denmark. This was the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War%20of%20Schleswig\"&gt;Second War of Schleswig&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in Danish defeat. &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; attempts to mediate in the &lt;a href=\"London%20Conference%20of%201864\"&gt;London Conference of 1864&lt;/a&gt; failed, and Denmark lost Schleswig (Northern and Southern Schleswig), Holstein, and &lt;a href=\"Herzogtum%20Lauenburg\"&gt;Lauenburg&lt;/a&gt; to Prussia and Austria.\nProvince of Prussia.\nContrary to the hopes of German Schleswig-Holsteiners, the area did not gain its independence, but was annexed as a province of Prussia in 1867. Also following the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Prussian%20War\"&gt;Austro-Prussian War&lt;/a&gt; in 1866, section five of the &lt;a href=\"Peace%20of%20Prague%20%281866%29\"&gt;Peace of Prague&lt;/a&gt; stipulated that the people of Northern Schleswig would be consulted in a &lt;a href=\"referendum\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on whether to remain under Prussian rule or return to Danish rule. This condition, however, was never fulfilled by Prussia. During the decades of Prussian rule within the &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt;, authorities attempted a &lt;a href=\"Germanisation\"&gt;Germanisation&lt;/a&gt; policy in the northern part of Schleswig, which remained predominantly Danish. The period also meant increased industrialisation of Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Kiel and Flensburg as important &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20German%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial German Navy&lt;/a&gt; locations. The northernmost part and west coast of the province saw a wave of emigration to America, while some Danes of North Schleswig emigrated to Denmark.\nPlebiscite in 1920.\nFollowing the defeat of Germany in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, the Allied powers arranged &lt;a href=\"Schleswig%20Plebiscites\"&gt;a plebiscite in northern and central Schleswig&lt;/a&gt;. The plebiscite was conducted under the auspices of an international commission which designated two voting zones to cover the northern and south-central parts of Schleswig. Steps were taken to also create a third zone covering a southern area, but zone III was cancelled again and never voted, as the Danish government asked the commission not to expand the plebiscite to this area.\nIn zone I covering Northern Schleswig (10 February 1920), 75% voted for &lt;a href=\"Political%20union\"&gt;reunification&lt;/a&gt; with Denmark and 25% voted for Germany. In zone II covering central Schleswig (14 March 1920), the results were reversed; 80% voted for Germany and just 20% for Denmark. Only minor areas on the island of &lt;a href=\"F%C3%B6hr\"&gt;F\u00f6hr&lt;/a&gt; showed a Danish majority, and the rest of the Danish vote was primarily in the town of Flensburg.\nOn 15 June 1920, Northern Schleswig officially returned to Danish rule. The Danish/German border was the only one of the borders imposed on Germany by the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Versailles\"&gt;Treaty of Versailles&lt;/a&gt; after World War I which was never challenged by &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Hitler\"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1937, the Nazis passed the so-called &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Hamburg%20Act\"&gt;Greater Hamburg Act&lt;/a&gt; (\"Gro\u00df-Hamburg-Gesetz\"), where the nearby Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg was expanded, to encompass towns that had formerly belonged to the Prussian &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein\"&gt;province of Schleswig-Holstein&lt;/a&gt;. To compensate Prussia for these losses (and partly because Hitler had a personal dislike for &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BCbeck\"&gt;L\u00fcbeck&lt;/a&gt;), the 711-year-long independence of the Hansestadt L\u00fcbeck came to an end, and almost all its territory was incorporated into Schleswig-Holstein.\nState of Federal Germany.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the Prussian province Schleswig-Holstein came under British occupation. On 23 August 1946, the military government abolished the province and reconstituted it as a separate \"Land\".\nDue to the &lt;a href=\"Flight%20and%20expulsion%20of%20Germans%20%281944%E2%80%931950%29\"&gt;forced migrations of Germans between 1944 and 1950&lt;/a&gt;, Schleswig-Holstein &lt;a href=\"Refugees%20in%20Schleswig-Holstein%20after%20the%20Second%20World%20War\"&gt;took in almost a million refugees&lt;/a&gt; after the war, increasing its population by 33%. A pro-Danish political movement arose in Schleswig, with transfer of the area to Denmark as an ultimate goal. This was supported neither by the British occupation administration nor the Danish government. In 1955, the German and Danish governments issued the &lt;a href=\"Bonn-Copenhagen%20declarations\"&gt;Bonn-Copenhagen Declarations&lt;/a&gt; confirming the rights of the ethnic minorities on both sides of the border. Conditions between the nationalities have since been stable and generally respectful.\nGeography.\nSchleswig-Holstein lies on the base of &lt;a href=\"Jutland%20Peninsula\"&gt;Jutland Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Strictly speaking, \"Schleswig\" refers to the German Southern Schleswig ( or \"Landesteil Schleswig\", ), whereas Northern Schleswig is in Denmark (&lt;a href=\"South%20Jutland%20County\"&gt;South Jutland County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Region%20of%20Southern%20Denmark\"&gt;Region of Southern Denmark&lt;/a&gt;). The state of Schleswig-Holstein further consists of Holstein, as well as &lt;a href=\"Lauenburg\"&gt;Lauenburg&lt;/a&gt; and the formerly independent city of L\u00fcbeck.\nSchleswig-Holstein borders Denmark (&lt;a href=\"Region%20of%20Southern%20Denmark\"&gt;Southern Denmark&lt;/a&gt;) to the north, the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, and the German states of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Saxony\"&gt;Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\"&gt;Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nIn the western part of the state, the lowlands have virtually no hills. The &lt;a href=\"North%20Frisian%20Islands\"&gt;North Frisian Islands&lt;/a&gt;, as well as almost all of Schleswig-Holstein's North Sea coast, form the &lt;a href=\"Schleswig-Holstein%20Wadden%20Sea%20National%20Park\"&gt;Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park&lt;/a&gt; (\"Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer\") which is the largest national park in Central Europe. Germany's only high-sea island, &lt;a href=\"Heligoland\"&gt;Heligoland&lt;/a&gt;, is situated in the North Sea.\nThe Baltic Sea coast in the east of Schleswig-Holstein is marked by bays, &lt;a href=\"fjord\"&gt;fjord&lt;/a&gt;s, and cliff lines. Rolling hills (the highest elevation is the Bungsberg at ) and many lakes are found, especially in the eastern part of Holstein called the &lt;a href=\"Holstein%20Switzerland\"&gt;Holstein Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; and the former Duchy of Lauenburg (\"Herzogtum Lauenburg\"). &lt;a href=\"Fehmarn\"&gt;Fehmarn&lt;/a&gt; is the only island off the eastern coast. The longest river besides the &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Eider%20%28river%29\"&gt;Eider&lt;/a&gt;.\nSchleswig-Holstein has the lowest quota of forest covered area, it is only 11.0% (national average 32.0%), which is even lower than in the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Hamburg\"&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bremen%20%28state%29\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypical landscape (from West to East):\nAdministration.\nSchleswig-Holstein is divided into 11 &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20Germany\"&gt;\"Kreise\"&lt;/a&gt; (districts):\nFurthermore, the four separate &lt;a href=\"Stadtbezirk\"&gt;urban districts&lt;/a&gt; are:\nDemographics.\nSchleswig-Holstein has an aging population. Since 1972 there has been a decrease in the natural rate of population change. In 2016 the &lt;a href=\"total%20fertility%20rate\"&gt;total fertility rate&lt;/a&gt; reached 1.61, highest value in 40 years (the average value being 1.4). In 2016 there were 25,420 births and 33,879 deaths, resulting in a natural decrease of -8,459. \nReligion.\nThe region has been strongly &lt;a href=\"Protestantism%20in%20Germany\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; since the time of the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Protestant Reformation&lt;/a&gt;. It is proportionally the most Protestant of the sixteen modern states. In 2018, members of the &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Church%20in%20Germany\"&gt;Evangelical Church in Germany&lt;/a&gt; make up 44.6% of the population, while members of the &lt;a href=\"Catholicism%20in%20Germany\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; comprise 6.1%. \n49.3% either adhere to other religions or disclaim any practising religious identity.\nForeigners.\nLargest groups of foreign residents by 31 December 2020\nCulture.\nSchleswig-Holstein combines Danish, Frisian and German aspects of culture. The castles and manors in the countryside are the best example for this tradition; some dishes like &lt;a href=\"R%C3%B8dgr%C3%B8d\"&gt;R\u00f8dgr\u00f8d&lt;/a&gt; (, literal English \"red &lt;a href=\"grits\"&gt;grits&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"red &lt;a href=\"groats\"&gt;groats&lt;/a&gt;\") are also shared, as well as surnames such as &lt;a href=\"Hansen%20%28surname%29\"&gt;Hansen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most important festivals are the Kiel Week, &lt;a href=\"Schleswig-Holstein%20Musik%20Festival\"&gt;Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival&lt;/a&gt;, an annual classic music festival all over the state, and the &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BCbeck%20Nordic%20Film%20Days\"&gt;L\u00fcbeck Nordic Film Days&lt;/a&gt;, an annual film festival for movies from &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;n countries, held in L\u00fcbeck.\nThe annual &lt;a href=\"Wacken%20Open%20Air\"&gt;Wacken Open Air&lt;/a&gt; festival is considered to be the largest heavy metal rock festival in the world.\nThe state's most important museum of cultural history is in &lt;a href=\"Gottorf%20Castle\"&gt;Gottorf Castle&lt;/a&gt; in Schleswig.\nThe Wagnerian tenor &lt;a href=\"Klaus%20Florian%20Vogt\"&gt;Klaus Florian Vogt&lt;/a&gt; is from Schleswig - Holstein.\nSymbols.\nThe &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;coat of arms&lt;/a&gt; shows the symbols of the two duchies united in Schleswig-Holstein, i.e., the two lions for Schleswig and the leaf of nettle for Holstein. Supposedly, &lt;a href=\"Otto%20von%20Bismarck\"&gt;Otto von Bismarck&lt;/a&gt; decreed that the two lions were to face the nettle because of the discomfort to their bottoms which would have resulted if the lions faced away from it.\nThe motto of Schleswig-Holstein is \"Up ewich ungedeelt\" (&lt;a href=\"Middle%20Low%20German\"&gt;Middle Low German&lt;/a&gt;: \"Forever undivided\", modern High German: \"Auf ewig ungeteilt\"). It goes back to the Vertrag von Ripen or Handfeste von Ripen (Danish: Ribe H\u00e5ndf\u00e6stning) or &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Ribe\"&gt;Treaty of Ribe&lt;/a&gt; in 1460. Ripen (&lt;a href=\"Ribe\"&gt;Ribe&lt;/a&gt;) is a historical small town in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Schleswig\"&gt;Northern Schleswig&lt;/a&gt;, nowadays Denmark. \nThe anthem from 1844 is called \"&lt;a href=\"Wanke%20nicht%2C%20mein%20Vaterland\"&gt;Wanke nicht, mein Vaterland&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Don't falter, my fatherland\"), but it is usually referred to with its first line \"Schleswig-Holstein meerumschlungen\" (i.e., \"Schleswig-Holstein embraced by the seas\") or \"Schleswig-Holstein-Lied\" (Schleswig-Holstein song).\nThe old city of L\u00fcbeck is a UNESCO &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;.\nFood and drink.\nDistinctive point of the cuisine is combination of sweetness with a taste contrast like sour or salty. These combinations are also described as \"broken sweetness\" is especially present in dishes which are sweet-sour.\nTypical dishes are:\nLanguages.\nThe official language of Schleswig-Holstein is &lt;a href=\"German%20language\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Low%20German\"&gt;Low German&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Danish%20language\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Frisian%20language\"&gt;North Frisian&lt;/a&gt; are recognized minority languages.\nHistorically, Low German (in Holstein and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Schleswig\"&gt;Southern Schleswig&lt;/a&gt;), Danish (in Schleswig), and North Frisian (in Western Schleswig) were widely spoken in Schleswig-Holstein. During the language change in the 19th century some Danish and North Frisian dialects in Southern Schleswig were replaced by &lt;a href=\"Standard%20German\"&gt;Standard German&lt;/a&gt;.\nLow German is still used in many parts of the state. &lt;a href=\"Missingsch\"&gt;Missingsch&lt;/a&gt;, a Low German dialect with heavy &lt;a href=\"High%20German\"&gt;High German&lt;/a&gt; (Standard German) influence, is commonly spoken informally throughout the state, while a &lt;a href=\"mixed%20language\"&gt;mixed language&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Petuh\"&gt;Petuh&lt;/a&gt; (mixture of High German and &lt;a href=\"Danish%20language\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt;) is used in and around &lt;a href=\"Flensburg\"&gt;Flensburg&lt;/a&gt;. Danish is used by the &lt;a href=\"Danish%20minority%20of%20Southern%20Schleswig\"&gt;Danish minority&lt;/a&gt; in Southern Schleswig, and North Frisian is spoken by the &lt;a href=\"North%20Frisians\"&gt;North Frisians&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20Coast\"&gt;North Sea Coast&lt;/a&gt; and the Northern Frisian Islands in Southern Schleswig. The North Frisian dialect called &lt;a href=\"Heligolandic%20dialect\"&gt;Heligolandic&lt;/a&gt; (\"Halunder\") is spoken on the island of &lt;a href=\"Heligoland\"&gt;Heligoland&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs is the case throughout Germany, High German, introduced in the 16th century, has come to steadily replace local dialects for official purposes, and is today the predominant language of media, law and legislature. It is spoken by virtually all inhabitants in formal situations. Since the end of World War II and widespread adoption of TV, radio and other &lt;a href=\"mass%20media\"&gt;mass media&lt;/a&gt;, it has gradually come to supplant local dialects in urban areas as well.\nEconomy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gross%20domestic%20product\"&gt;Gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt; (GDP) of the state was 62.7 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.9% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 30,400 euros or 101% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 95% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the lowest of all states in West Germany. In 2017, Schleswig-Holstein had an export surplus for the first time since 1989: export 22.6 billion euros/ import 20.8 billion euros.\nEnergy.\nSchleswig-Holstein is a leader in the &lt;a href=\"Renewable%20energy%20in%20Germany\"&gt;country's&lt;/a&gt; growing &lt;a href=\"renewable%20energy\"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; industry. In 2014, Schleswig-Holstein became the first &lt;a href=\"states%20of%20Germany\"&gt;German state&lt;/a&gt; to cover 100% of its electric power demand with renewable energy sources (chiefly &lt;a href=\"wind%20power\"&gt;wind&lt;/a&gt; 70%, &lt;a href=\"solar%20power\"&gt;solar&lt;/a&gt; 3.8%, and biomass 8.3%).\nThe largest German oil field &lt;a href=\"Mittelplate\"&gt;Mittelplate&lt;/a&gt; is located in the North Sea off the &lt;a href=\"Dithmarschen\"&gt;Dithmarsch&lt;/a&gt; coast and connected with refinery in &lt;a href=\"Hemmingstedt\"&gt;Hemmingstedt&lt;/a&gt; and chemical plants in &lt;a href=\"Brunsb%C3%BCttel\"&gt;Brunsb\u00fcttel&lt;/a&gt; via pipeline. It produce ca. 1.4 million tonnes of oil annually.\nNuclear power.\nThere were three nuclear power plants in Schleswig-Holstein: &lt;a href=\"Kr%C3%BCmmel%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant\"&gt;Kr\u00fcmmel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brunsb%C3%BCttel%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant\"&gt;Brunsb\u00fcttel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brokdorf%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant\"&gt;Brockdorf&lt;/a&gt;. The last operating plant in Schleswig-Holstein, the &lt;a href=\"Brokdorf%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant\"&gt;Brokdorf-plant&lt;/a&gt; was shut down on new-years eve 2021.\nThere is also a nuclear research center knwon Helmholtz-Zentrum Geeshacht (rebranded as Hereon) with 2 research reactors, located right next to the Kr\u00fcmmel plant.\nDuring the 1990s, ten more cases of leukemia among children than was expected were identified in &lt;a href=\"Elbmarsch\"&gt;Elbmarsch&lt;/a&gt;, near the Kr\u00fcmmel plant. Anti-nuclear activists believed it was due to the nuclear plant, which led to several investigations. The reported discovery of small spherical beads of nuclear material in the area led to further concern, as well as the presence of minute amounts of plutonium in the &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt;. The origins of the nuclear material were disputed, with one report determining them to not be that of the Kr\u00fcmmel plant. Another report claimed that they may have come from an undisclosed fire in 1986, however this theory has been questioned as it would have required a substantial government coverup. The Chernobyl disaster has also been suggested as a source, though is considered unlikely. The probable source of the material, especially in the Elbe, is nuclear reprocessing plants in France. A 2010 report exonerated the nuclear power plants on the Elbe as the cause of contamination. Further doubt was cast on the nature of the supposed beads of nuclear material, with a Federal commission chastising the original commission that claimed to have discovered the beads. The exact cause of the increased leukemia cases remains unknown, and could be due to other environmental factors, or even by chance.\nThe nuclear plants have further been questioned as a source of the cases due to comparison to the &lt;a href=\"Savannah%20River%20Site\"&gt;Savannah River Site&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. Despite release of radiation at the Savannah River Site, there is no increase in cases of leukemia around it. Alternative hypotheses for the cause of the cases have included &lt;a href=\"electromagnetic%20field\"&gt;electromagnetic field&lt;/a&gt;s, parental &lt;a href=\"radiation\"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt; exposure prior to conception, other &lt;a href=\"carcinogen\"&gt;carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"benzene\"&gt;benzene&lt;/a&gt; exposure; however, none have been supported by the existing evidence. Intriguingly, a larger case-control study in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Saxony\"&gt;Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt; found a correlation between the \"untrained immune system\" (as judged as contact with other children, vaccinations, etc.) and leukemia risk, suggested that an immature immune system that has not been challenged is at greater risk for developing malignancy, possibly secondary to an undetermined environment factor.\nTourism.\nLocated between the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;, Schleswig-Holstein is also a popular &lt;a href=\"Tourism%20in%20Germany\"&gt;tourist destination in Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Its islands, beaches and cities attract millions of tourists every year. It has the second highest tourism intensity per local among the German states, after &lt;a href=\"Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\"&gt;Mecklenburg-Vorpommern&lt;/a&gt;, but in absolute value it is rank 6th and only 1/3 of top destination &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;. According to a ruling by the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Administrative%20Court%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;Federal Administrative Court&lt;/a&gt;, everyone has the right to free access to the beach. Nevertheless, most of the seaside resorts kept cashing in (2-\u20ac3 /day/person).\nAgriculture.\n63% of land in Schleswig-Holstein (990 403 ha) is used for agriculture (national average 47%).\nCultivated crops:\nThere are some special cultivation regions:\nAnimal husbandry.\nThe dairy and cattle farming in connection with fodder cultivation is mainly concentrated on the marshland and the bordering Geest areas. In 2020, around 1 million cattle including 360,000 dairy cows were counted in Schleswig-Holstein, rank 4th of German states. Livestock is continuously declining.\nSchleswig-Holstein is home of the most productive dairy cattle: &lt;a href=\"Holstein%20Friesian%20cattle\"&gt;Holsteins&lt;/a&gt;, which produce an average of per year of milk. It is now the main dairy cow around the world.\nPig breeding is mainly found in the &lt;a href=\"Schleswig-Holstein%20Uplands\"&gt;Schleswig-Holstein Uplands&lt;/a&gt;. In principle, Schleswig-Holstein is one of the regions with relatively few pigs (a total of around 1.6 million; in comparison &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Saxony\"&gt;Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt;: over 8 million). Poultry and sheep are also of little importance in animal husbandry.\nSchleswig-Holstein had Europe's largest snake farm in &lt;a href=\"Uetersen\"&gt;Uetersen&lt;/a&gt; with over 600 venomous reptiles, but it closed in 2019.\nFishing and Aquaculture.\nTotal production from fishing in North and Baltic Seas was 40 780 tonnes in 2019, ca. 1/3 German production.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; total production amounted to 10377 tonnes (2019), of which 5432 tonnes of &lt;a href=\"European%20sprat\"&gt;sprat&lt;/a&gt;, 2568 tonnes of &lt;a href=\"flatfish\"&gt;flatfish&lt;/a&gt; and 1190 tonnes of &lt;a href=\"atlantic%20cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; the numbers were 19,487 tonnes of &lt;a href=\"Mytilidae\"&gt;mussels&lt;/a&gt;, 3560 tonnes of &lt;a href=\"Crangon%20crangon\"&gt;North Sea shrimp&lt;/a&gt;, 1166 tonnes of &lt;a href=\"herring\"&gt;herring&lt;/a&gt; and 7062 other fishes.\nThe one important aquaculture product is &lt;a href=\"Mytilidae\"&gt;mussels&lt;/a&gt;, 16864 tonnes.\nInland fishing and aquaculture is not significant with 221 and 250 tonnes in 2019 respectively.\nCompanies.\nThe largest company headquarters in Schleswig-Holstein with annual sales over 1 billion euros are:\nThe unemployment rate stood at 5.0% in October 2021.\nTransport.\nKiel Canal.\nThe most important transport way in Schleswig-Holstein is Kiel Canal, which connect &lt;a href=\"Brunsb%C3%BCttel\"&gt;Brunsb\u00fcttel&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Total cargo of ships reach peaks in 2007 and 2012, after that it continuous decline with 73.8 million tonnes in 2020.\nPorts.\nThe state has a total of 46 public ports and landing stages, four of which fulfill international transit functions: &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt;, L\u00fcbeck / &lt;a href=\"Travem%C3%BCnde\"&gt;Travem\u00fcnde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Puttgarden\"&gt;Puttgarden&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;, Brunsb\u00fcttel on the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Kiel and L\u00fcbeck are also important for freight traffic to Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. L\u00fcbeck-Travem\u00fcnde and Kiel are also important ferry and cruise ports. Puttgarden is the German port of the Vogelfluglinie to Denmark. Brunsb\u00fcttel is an important port for bulk goods and also serves as the basis for the offshore wind energy industry.\nEducation.\nCompulsory education starts for children who are six years old on 30 June. All children attend a \"Grundschule\", which is &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s equivalent to primary school, for the first 4 years and then move on to a secondary school. In Schleswig-Holstein there are \"Gemeinschaftsschulen\", which is a new type of comprehensive school. The regional schools, which go by the German name \"Regionalschule\" have been done away with as of 1 January 2014. The option of a &lt;a href=\"Gymnasium%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/a&gt; is still available.\nIn a comparison of the federal states, Schleswig-Holstein has the highest student-to-teacher ratio in Germany at around 16.5:1 (national average: 15.2:1). In addition, Schleswig-Holstein is 14th from 16 federal state in terms of expenditure per pupil at public schools with around 5750 euros (national average: 6500 euros).\nThere are three universities in &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt; (classical, budget 167.1 M\u20ac), &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20L%C3%BCbeck\"&gt;L\u00fcbeck&lt;/a&gt; (medicine, budget 80.8 M\u20ac) and &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Flensburg\"&gt;Flensburg&lt;/a&gt; (pedagogical, 37.4 M\u20ac). It is really poor financing in comparison to universities with the same size in South Germany, for example &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20T%C3%BCbingen\"&gt;University of T\u00fcbingen&lt;/a&gt; has budget (2019) 642.2 M\u20ac. Also, there are four public Universities of Applied Sciences in &lt;a href=\"Flensburg%20University%20of%20Applied%20Sciences\"&gt;Flensburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heide\"&gt;Heide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kiel%20University%20of%20Applied%20Sciences\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Technical%20University%20of%20Applied%20Sciences%20L%C3%BCbeck\"&gt;L\u00fcbeck&lt;/a&gt;. There is the Conservatory in L\u00fcbeck and the Muthesius Academy of Fine Arts in Kiel. There are also three private institutions of higher learning.\nPolitics.\nSchleswig-Holstein has its own &lt;a href=\"Landtag%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein\"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt; and government which are located in the state capital Kiel. The &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Ministers-President%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein\"&gt;Minister-President&lt;/a&gt; of Schleswig-Holstein is elected by the &lt;a href=\"Landtag%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein\"&gt;Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecent elections.\nThe most recent Schleswig-Holstein state elections were held on 7 May 2017. The governing parties consisting of the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"South%20Schleswig%20Voters%27%20Association\"&gt;South Schleswig Voters' Association&lt;/a&gt; lost their majority."
