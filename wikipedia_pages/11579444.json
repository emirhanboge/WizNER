    "text": "Robert Lee Fulton Sikes (June 3, 1906September 28, 1994) was an American politician of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; who represented the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Panhandle\"&gt;Florida Panhandle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; from 1941 to 1979, with a brief break in 1944 and 1945 for service during World WarII.\nHe served during a long period in which Florida was effectively a one-party state dominated by Democrats, as the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; had been weakened by the &lt;a href=\"Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era\"&gt;disfranchisement&lt;/a&gt; of African Americans by racist policies and &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Crow%20laws\"&gt;Jim Crow laws&lt;/a&gt;. The Republican Party began a resurgence in the 1970s.\nIn 1975 Sikes was accused by &lt;a href=\"Common%20Cause\"&gt;Common Cause&lt;/a&gt; of financial misconduct and was investigated and censured by the House in 1976. He did not seek re-election in 1978.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn in Isabella, near &lt;a href=\"Sylvester%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Sylvester, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, Sikes attended the public schools, which were segregated. He obtained his &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Science\"&gt;Bachelor of Science&lt;/a&gt; in 1927 from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Athens%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a member of &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Gamma%20Rho\"&gt;Alpha Gamma Rho&lt;/a&gt; fraternity. He went to Florida for graduate school, receiving a &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Science\"&gt;Master of Science&lt;/a&gt; in 1929 from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Florida\"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Gainesville%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Gainesville&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nSikes entered the publishing business in &lt;a href=\"Crestview%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Crestview&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Panhandle\"&gt;Florida Panhandle&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Destin%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Destin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Walton%20Beach\"&gt;Fort Walton Beach&lt;/a&gt;, working in that field from 1933 to 1946.\nHe soon became active in politics, joining the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, which was effectively the only party for whites in the state in the early part of his career. At the turn of the century, the Democratic-dominated legislature had passed a new constitution and laws that &lt;a href=\"Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era\"&gt;disenfranchised&lt;/a&gt; most African Americans, crippling the Republican Party, of which they had been the majority. Sikes was elected in 1936 to the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Florida House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; and a landslide year for the Democrats, aligned with the popular President &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;. Sikes was re-elected, serving until 1940.\nSikes was elected in 1940 to the &lt;a href=\"77th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;Seventy-seventh&lt;/a&gt; Congress from what was then the 3rd District, and was re-elected to a second term in the &lt;a href=\"78th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;Seventy-eighth&lt;/a&gt; Congress. His victory followed a bitter Democratic primary campaign. As Florida was then essentially a one-party state, most races were effectively decided in the Democratic primary.\nSikes served from January 3, 1941, until his resignation on October 19, 1944, to enter the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt; during World WarII. He was commissioned as a major. As a Congressman, Sikes had pressed for development in the state, including of &lt;a href=\"Eglin%20Field\"&gt;Eglin Field&lt;/a&gt; as a test facility of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces\"&gt;United States Army Air Forces&lt;/a&gt;, and later, the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Air%20Force\"&gt;U.S. Air Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; ordered all legislators on active duty to return to Washington, Sikes ran for his old seat in 1944 and won. He served in the &lt;a href=\"79th%20United%20States%20Congress\"&gt;79th&lt;/a&gt; and sixteen succeeding Congresses. After the war, Sikes was selected as a delegate to the Interparliamentary Conference in &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, in 1959.\nSikes was a signatory to the 1956 &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Manifesto\"&gt;Southern Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in \"&lt;a href=\"Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education\"&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSikes was a colleague of representatives &lt;a href=\"Courtney%20W.%20Campbell\"&gt;Courtney W. Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow Democrat, and &lt;a href=\"William%20C.%20Cramer\"&gt;William C. Cramer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida\"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated Campbell in 1954 to become the first &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; elected in Florida to the House delegation since 1880 after Reconstruction.\nSikes in his memoir describes the Campbell-Cramer campaign of 1954:\nCourtney Campbell hard-working, dedicated, and capable but ineffective in public speaking... Courtney couldn't cope with the articulate Bill Cramer on the platform... Cramer was articulate, a successful lawyer, and he already enjoyed some recognition in public life. In my effort to help Campbell, I said that Cramer, serving in a Democratic Congress, would be like a lost ball in high weeds. Bill never let me forget that statement, although subsequently we became good friends.\nSikes's district, which was renumbered as the 1st District in 1963, began moving away from its &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Dog%20Democrat\"&gt;Yellow Dog Democrat&lt;/a&gt;ic roots after World WarII. The district's voters began splitting their tickets as early as the 1950s, and voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election from 1964 onward, except when the segregationist third-party candidacy of &lt;a href=\"George%20Wallace\"&gt;George Wallace&lt;/a&gt; won a majority &lt;a href=\"1968%20United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20Florida\"&gt;in 1968&lt;/a&gt;. However, Sikes remained very popular at home. He never won less than 80 percent of the vote, and usually faced \"&lt;a href=\"sacrificial%20lamb\"&gt;sacrificial lamb&lt;/a&gt;\" Republican challengers on the occasions he faced any opposition at all. In 1964, for instance, Sikes was reelected unopposed even as &lt;a href=\"Barry%20Goldwater\"&gt;Barry Goldwater&lt;/a&gt; won the district by such a large margin it almost pushed Florida into the Republican column.\nIn Congress, Sikes became one of the most powerful men in Washington; he was often called \"Florida's third Senator\". He used his seniority to help build fourteen military bases in the Panhandle. He also had a reputation for strong constituent service, which garnered him the nickname \"the He-Coon\". Sikes said the nickname is from a Panhandle legend about a male &lt;a href=\"raccoon\"&gt;raccoon&lt;/a&gt; that not only knew where food and water were, but also fended off his enemies and looked after his territoryas Sikes put it, a he-coon was expected to \"look after those around him\".\nAlong with Republican congressmen &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Edwards%20%28American%20politician%29\"&gt;Jack Edwards&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alabama\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trent%20Lott\"&gt;Trent Lott&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, Sikes helped originate the \"&lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coast%20Congressional%20Report\"&gt;Gulf Coast Congressional Report&lt;/a&gt;\" on &lt;a href=\"WKRG-TV\"&gt;WKRG-TV&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mobile%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Mobile, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; (the CBS affiliate for most of his district) in 1973. He left the program in 1979 upon his retirement.\nReprimand.\nIn 1975, &lt;a href=\"Common%20Cause\"&gt;Common Cause&lt;/a&gt;, a public-affairs lobbying group, accused Sikes of using his office for personal gain. He owned stock in a &lt;a href=\"Pensacola%20Naval%20Air%20Station\"&gt;Pensacola Naval Air Station&lt;/a&gt; bank that had been established by government officials at his urging, as well as in military contractor &lt;a href=\"Fairchild%20Industries\"&gt;Fairchild Industries&lt;/a&gt;, which benefited from government contracts. He failed to disclose his interest in both these companies in the requisite financial reports. Sikes was reprimanded by a 381-3 vote of the House of Representatives on July 26, 1976, for the financial misconduct. Sikes, a strong &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20%28politics%29\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt;, believed \"flaming liberals\" had conspired against him.\nLater years, death and legacy.\nSikes did not seek reelection in 1978 to Congress, having never lost an election in 45 years as an elected official. Upon his political retirement, Sikes returned to Crestview and devoted himself to his business interests. He died on September 28, 1994."
