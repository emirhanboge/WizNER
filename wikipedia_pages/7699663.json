    "text": "Willie MacFarlane (17 March 1930 \u2013 11 March 2010) was a Scottish &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28football%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt; who played for and managed &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and playing career.\nMacFarlane played as a &lt;a href=\"defender%20%28football%29\"&gt;full\u2013back&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s, when the club featured the forward line known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Famous%20Five%20%28football%29\"&gt;The Famous Five&lt;/a&gt;. He was born in Leith and brought up in the same area (&lt;a href=\"Slateford\"&gt;Hutchison&lt;/a&gt;) as goalkeeper &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Younger\"&gt;Tommy Younger&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he played for &lt;a href=\"Lothian%20Thistle%20Hutchison%20Vale%20F.C.\"&gt;Hutchison Vale&lt;/a&gt; and the Army. Both players were then signed for Hibs by manager &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Shaw%20%28football%20manager%29\"&gt;Hugh Shaw&lt;/a&gt;. He was taken by Hibs on a tour of Brazil in 1953 to play in three games in the &lt;a href=\"Maracan%C3%A3%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;Maracana&lt;/a&gt; stadium against &lt;a href=\"CR%20Vasco%20da%20Gama\"&gt;Vasco da Gama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Botafogo%20de%20Futebol%20e%20Regatas\"&gt;Botafogo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fluminense%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Fluminense&lt;/a&gt;. MacFarlane also played for Hibs in the first season of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt;, playing in five of the six matches possible. Hibs eventually lost to &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Reims\"&gt;Stade Reims&lt;/a&gt; in the semi-final, where MacFarlane was pitted against &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20Kopa\"&gt;Raymond Kopa&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormer teammate &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Preston\"&gt;Tommy Preston&lt;/a&gt; described MacFarlane as \"resolute\", \"strong\" and capable of striking a good &lt;a href=\"direct%20free%20kick\"&gt;free kick&lt;/a&gt;.\nMacFarlane played for &lt;a href=\"Raith%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Raith Rovers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greenock%20Morton%20F.C.\"&gt;Morton&lt;/a&gt; later in his playing career.\nManagerial career and later life.\nMacFarlane began his &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28football%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;ial career with &lt;a href=\"East%20of%20Scotland%20Football%20League\"&gt;East of Scotland League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Hawick%20Royal%20Albert%20F.C.\"&gt;Hawick Royal Albert&lt;/a&gt;. He joined &lt;a href=\"Stirling%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Stirling Albion&lt;/a&gt; in March 1968, before taking a similar post at Hibernian in 1969. Chairman &lt;a href=\"William%20Harrower\"&gt;William Harrower&lt;/a&gt; appointed MacFarlane to replace &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Shankly\"&gt;Bob Shankly&lt;/a&gt;, who had resigned. Despite suffering early exits in the two cup competitions, Hibs qualified for the &lt;a href=\"Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup\"&gt;Inter-Cities Fairs Cup&lt;/a&gt; by finishing third in the Scottish League. During that first season, MacFarlane's team set a club record for consecutive wins. Hibs beat &lt;a href=\"Malm%C3%B6%20FF\"&gt;Malm\u00f6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vit%C3%B3ria%20S.C.\"&gt;Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es&lt;/a&gt; to progress to the third round of the Fairs Cup, where they would lose to &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Shankly\"&gt;Bill Shankly&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; side. That tie with Liverpool led to MacFarlane's departure from Hibs. Chairman &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Hart%20%28businessman%29\"&gt;Tom Hart&lt;/a&gt;, who had just bought the club from Harrower, overruled him on team selection and sacked MacFarlane prior to the match.\nMacFarlane \"oversaw the early stages of one of the finest ever Hibernian sides\". Having signed &lt;a href=\"Erich%20Schaedler\"&gt;Erich Schaedler&lt;/a&gt; in his previous managerial post at Stirling Albion, MacFarlane made Schaedler his first signing as Hibs manager. He moved &lt;a href=\"John%20Brownlie\"&gt;John Brownlie&lt;/a&gt; from playing in central defence to an attacking full back role, an \"inspirational\" choice. Having sold &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Marinello\"&gt;Peter Marinello&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; for a record transfer fee, MacFarlane then signed &lt;a href=\"Falkirk%20F.C.\"&gt;Falkirk&lt;/a&gt; player Johnny Graham, who scored a &lt;a href=\"hat-trick\"&gt;hat-trick&lt;/a&gt; in his first game. He also signed &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Duncan%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201947%29\"&gt;Arthur Duncan&lt;/a&gt;, who went on to set the record for most league appearances for Hibs. Former player &lt;a href=\"John%20Fraser%20%28footballer%20born%201936%29\"&gt;John Fraser&lt;/a&gt;, who worked as a coach for MacFarlane, described him as an \"enthusiastic\" manager, who established a good rapport with his players.\nAfter leaving Hibs, MacFarlane had a spell as manager of &lt;a href=\"Livingston%20F.C.\"&gt;Meadowbank Thistle&lt;/a&gt; between 1978 and 1980. MacFarlane also ran a &lt;a href=\"bookmaker\"&gt;bookmaker&lt;/a&gt;s business in Edinburgh and regularly attended matches at Easter Road. He was also a keen golf player and &lt;a href=\"karaoke\"&gt;karaoke&lt;/a&gt; singer. MacFarlane died in hospital on the morning of 11 March 2010, after a \"short illness\"."
