In June through July 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operation. Together with &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Qatar\"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment.\nDuring 5 December 2011, about 35 armed fighters tried to cross the border of Syria from Turkey, but were engaged by the Syrian border forces who were able to repel them back to Turkey. Once they were back on Turkish soil, the Turkish army allegedly picked them up in trucks and took care of the injured fighters. A further attempt happened during the night of 12 December, when 15 infiltrators tried again to cross the border. They were unsuccessful and two of them were killed by Syrian border patrols.\nOn 22 June 2012, a &lt;a href=\"June%202012%20interception%20of%20Turkish%20aircraft\"&gt;Turkish F-4 fighter jet was shot down&lt;/a&gt; by Syrian government forces. Both pilots were killed. Syria stated that it had shot the fighter down using anti-aircraft artillery near the village of Om al-Tuyour, while it was flying over Syrian &lt;a href=\"territorial%20waters\"&gt;territorial waters&lt;/a&gt; one kilometre away from land. Turkey's foreign minister stated the jet was shot down in international airspace after accidentally entering Syrian airspace, while it was on a training flight to test Turkey's radar capabilities. Turkish Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdogan\"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdogan&lt;/a&gt; vowed retaliation, saying: \"The rules of engagement of the Turkish Armed Forces have changed ... Turkey will support Syrian people in every way until they get rid of the bloody dictator and his gang.\" Ankara acknowledged that the jet had flown over Syria for a short time, but said such temporary overflights were common, had not led to an attack before, and alleged that Syrian helicopters had violated Turkish airspace five times without being attacked and that a second, search-and-rescue jet had been fired at. Assad later expressed regret over the incident. In August 2012, reports appeared in some Turkish newspapers claiming that the Turkish General Staff had deliberately misinformed the Turkish government about the fighter's location when it was shot down. The reports said that a NATO command post at Izmir and a British base in Cyprus had confirmed that the fighter was shot down inside Syrian waters and that radar intelligence from U.S. forces had disproved any \"accidentally entered Syrian waters\" flightpath error. The General Staff denied the claims.\nThe 2 October 2012 incident and afterward.\nAttacks from Syria.\nAs the clashes between the government forces and the opposition in Syria intensified, artillery shells began to fall across the border onto Turkish soil. On 3 October 2012 at 16:25 &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20European%20Summer%20Time\"&gt;EEST&lt;/a&gt; (13:25 &lt;a href=\"UTC\"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), a bomb fired from Syria hit a house in the central area of Ak\u00e7akale. A 39-year-old mother and her three children aged between eight and 14 years and another woman of 40 years of age were killed by the blast. Thirteen others, including police officers, were injured. Three of the injured had light wounds while two of them were severely wounded. The source of the shells and their manufacturer remain unknown as Turkish authorities have not released a ballistic test.\nTurkish military retaliation.\nAt 18:00 (local time in Turkey; GMT/UTC + 02:00) the same day, five &lt;a href=\"General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon\"&gt;F-16 fighter&lt;/a&gt;s from the 8th Main Jet Base Group of the 2nd Tactical Air Force Command at &lt;a href=\"Diyarbak%C4%B1r%20Airport\"&gt;Diyarbak\u0131r Air Base&lt;/a&gt; and RF-4E &lt;a href=\"reconnaissance%20aircraft\"&gt;reconnaissance aircraft&lt;/a&gt; from the 7th Main Jet Base Group Command in &lt;a href=\"Malatya%20Erha%C3%A7%20Airport\"&gt;Malatya Erha\u00e7 Air Base&lt;/a&gt; conducted reconnaissance missions along the border, identifying Syrian military targets and relaying their coordinates to the Turkish Armed Forces Command in Ankara. Turkish artillery then conducted saturation shelling of these targets with &lt;a href=\"T-155%20F%C4%B1rt%C4%B1na\"&gt;T-155 F\u0131rt\u0131na&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"howitzer\"&gt;howitzer&lt;/a&gt;s, which have a firing range of .

The one-year mandate, according to Turkish officials, is not expected to be carried out.\nOctober 2012 incidents.\nOn 5 October 2012, shells fired by Syrian artillery in &lt;a href=\"Latakia\"&gt;Latakia&lt;/a&gt; landed in the rural area of A\u015fa\u011f\u0131pulluyaz\u0131 village (Coordinates: ) in the &lt;a href=\"Yaylada%C4%9F%C4%B1\"&gt;Yaylada\u011f\u0131&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"Hatay%20Province\"&gt;Hatay Province&lt;/a&gt;. The day before, &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Turkey\"&gt;Turkish Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan\"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan&lt;/a&gt; had announced at a press conference during the official visit of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20President%20of%20Iran\"&gt;Iranian First Vice President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mohammad-Reza%20Rahimi\"&gt;Mohammad-Reza Rahimi&lt;/a&gt; that a Syrian shell had fallen in &lt;a href=\"Alt%C4%B1n%C3%B6z%C3%BC\"&gt;Alt\u0131n\u00f6z\u00fc&lt;/a&gt;, Hatay Province. The second incident caused no damage to persons or property. Immediately after this second incident in Hatay, artillery of the Turkish 3rd Border Battalion stationed in Yaylada\u011f\u0131 fired on Syrian military targets.\nA grain depot in Akcakale suffered minor damage from shrapnel from a Syrian mortar round exploding on 6 October 2012, though no injuries were reported. Turkey responded by shelling Syrian military targets over the border and positioning a platoon of &lt;a href=\"ACV-300\"&gt;ACV-300&lt;/a&gt; armored personnel carriers on the southern edge of Ak\u00e7akale, with their weapons pointed at Tel Abyad, a town a few kilometres into Syria.\nOn 8 October 2012, &lt;a href=\"Alt%C4%B1n%C3%B6z%C3%BC\"&gt;Alt\u0131n\u00f6z\u00fc&lt;/a&gt; was again hit by Syrian mortar fire, the six shells landed in a rural area causing no injury or loss of life.

Inspectors claimed confiscating ammunition, military communications equipment and items \"thought to be missile parts\", however evidence has not been publicly shown. The Russian foreign minister denied the claims and said that the plane cargo included only radar units.\nOn 17 October 2012, Turkish artillery fired into Syria after a Syrian mortar shell landed on Turkish territory in Hatay province. No casualties were reported on either side.\nOn 23 October 2012, an anti-aircraft shell struck a health center in &lt;a href=\"Reyhanl%C4%B1\"&gt;Reyhanl\u0131&lt;/a&gt;, approximately from the Syrian border. The shell landed in an empty room, and no injuries were reported. It was apparently fired from &lt;a href=\"Harem%2C%20Syria\"&gt;Harem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Idlib%20Governorate\"&gt;Idlib Governorate&lt;/a&gt;, where clashes were reportedly underway between rebels and government troops.\nTwo Syrian anti-aircraft shells struck 300 meters north of the village of Be\u015faslan in Hatay Province, Turkey on 29 October 2012, to which Turkey immediately responded by firing artillery rounds into Syria.

The US urged Turkey to stop the shelling of the Kurds and focus on fighting the group Islamic State (IS), however, Turkey defied the US and French calls and continued the shelling the next day too. Also, in a telephone call with German Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Merkel\"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt;, Turkish Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Ahmet%20Davutoglu\"&gt;Ahmet Davutoglu&lt;/a&gt; said Turkey will continue to strike back at Kurdish fighters in Syria. Kurdish officials said that at least three YPG fighters have died since the shelling started on Saturday.\nSyria called the Turkish strikes a violation of its territory, and urged UN Security Council action to \"put an end to the crimes of the Turkish regime\".

When shells and other munitions occasionally crossed into Turkish territory, the Turkish army would shoot back. There was also a massive refugee problem, and this led to riots in Turkey and further action by the parliament.\nClashes inside Syria.\n91 Syrian Army soldiers were killed by Turkish Armed Forces and allied groups in Afrin during 2018 &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Olive%20Branch\"&gt;Operation Olive Branch&lt;/a&gt; (96 Turkish soldiers were killed in these clashes).\nOn 13 June 2019, during an ongoing &lt;a href=\"Northwestern%20Syria%20offensive%20%28April%202019%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;offensive&lt;/a&gt; by the Syrian government against rebels in &lt;a href=\"Idlib%20Governorate\"&gt;Idlib&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hama%20Governorate\"&gt;Hama&lt;/a&gt;, pro-government forces reportedly targeted Turkish &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20military%20operation%20in%20Idlib%20Governorate\"&gt;observation&lt;/a&gt; forces stationed in the area as part of &lt;a href=\"Idlib%20demilitarization%20%282018%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;demilitarization&lt;/a&gt; agreement between &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. The Turkish minister of defense stated that the attack on Turkish forces included 35 mortar shells, 3 Turkish soldiers were reportedly wounded as a result, soon after the Russian government claimed that a cease-fire had been established between Turkey, Russia, the rebels and the Syrian government, however the rebels and Turkish government denied a cease-fire had been implemented. In response to the attacks Turkish foreign minister &lt;a href=\"Mevl%C3%BCt%20%C3%87avu%C5%9Fo%C4%9Flu\"&gt;Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu&lt;/a&gt; stated the attacks were intentional, the Turkish government also stated the Turkish military would respond to any attacks on their positions in Syria. The Russian military denied the Syrian government was behind the attack but instead blamed the Syrian rebels calling them \"terrorists\", for attacking Turkish positions, the Russian government also claimed that the Turkish government had asked the Russian military for help in protecting Turkish forces in Idlib and that the Turkish government had given the coordinates of rebel positions to the Russian military.\nOn 14 June, the following day the Turkish military sent reinforcements to Idlib. On 16 June, the Turkish government claimed that Turkish positions in Idlib had again come under Syrian government fire and retaliated by shelling Syrian government positions. On 19 August, a Turkish military convoy headed towards &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Shaykhun\"&gt;Khan Shaykhun&lt;/a&gt; was targeted by Syrian warplanes multiple times.
