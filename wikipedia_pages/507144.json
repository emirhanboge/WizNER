    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"computing\"&gt;computing&lt;/a&gt;, an address space defines a range of discrete addresses, each of which may correspond to a &lt;a href=\"network%20host\"&gt;network host&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"peripheral%20device\"&gt;peripheral device&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"disk%20sector\"&gt;disk sector&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"computer%20data%20storage\"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; cell or other logical or physical entity.\nFor &lt;a href=\"software%20program\"&gt;software program&lt;/a&gt;s to save and retrieve stored data, each datum must have an address where it can be located. The number of address spaces available depends on the underlying address structure, which is usually limited by the &lt;a href=\"computer%20architecture\"&gt;computer architecture&lt;/a&gt; being used. Often an address space in a system with &lt;a href=\"virtual%20memory\"&gt;virtual memory&lt;/a&gt; corresponds to a highest level translation table, e.g., a &lt;a href=\"memory%20segmentation\"&gt;segment table&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"IBM%20System/370\"&gt;IBM System/370&lt;/a&gt;.\nAddress spaces are created by combining enough uniquely identified qualifiers to make an address unambiguous within the address space. For a person's physical address, the \"address space\" would be a combination of locations, such as a neighborhood, town, city, or country. Some elements of a data address space may be the same, but if any element in the address is different, addresses in said space will reference different entities. For example, there could be multiple buildings at the same address of \"32 Main Street\" but in different towns, demonstrating that different towns have different, although similarly arranged, &lt;a href=\"street%20address\"&gt;street address&lt;/a&gt; spaces.\nAn address space usually provides (or allows) a partitioning to several regions according to the &lt;a href=\"mathematical%20structure\"&gt;mathematical structure&lt;/a&gt; it has. In the case of &lt;a href=\"total%20order\"&gt;total order&lt;/a&gt;, as for &lt;a href=\"memory%20address\"&gt;memory address&lt;/a&gt;es, these are simply &lt;a href=\"interval%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;chunks&lt;/a&gt;. Like the hierarchical design of &lt;a href=\"postal%20address\"&gt;postal address&lt;/a&gt;es, some nested domain hierarchies appear as a &lt;a href=\"arborescence%20%28graph%20theory%29\"&gt;directed ordered tree&lt;/a&gt;, such as with the &lt;a href=\"Domain%20Name%20System\"&gt;Domain Name System&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"directory%20structure\"&gt;directory structure&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Internet\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Internet%20Assigned%20Numbers%20Authority\"&gt;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority&lt;/a&gt; (IANA) allocates ranges of &lt;a href=\"IP%20address\"&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt;es to various registries so each can manage their parts of the global Internet address space.\nExamples.\nUses of addresses include, but are not limited to the following:\nAddress mapping and translation.\nAnother common feature of address spaces are &lt;a href=\"map%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;mappings and translations&lt;/a&gt;, often forming numerous layers. This usually means that some higher-level address must be translated to lower-level ones in some way. \nFor example, &lt;a href=\"file%20system\"&gt;file system&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"logical%20disk\"&gt;logical disk&lt;/a&gt; operates &lt;a href=\"one-dimensional%20array\"&gt;linear&lt;/a&gt; sector numbers, which have to be translated to \"absolute\" &lt;a href=\"Logical%20block%20addressing\"&gt;LBA&lt;/a&gt; sector addresses, in simple cases, via &lt;a href=\"addition\"&gt;addition&lt;/a&gt; of the partition's first sector address. Then, for a disk drive connected via &lt;a href=\"Parallel%20ATA\"&gt;Parallel ATA&lt;/a&gt;, each of them must be converted to \"logical\" &lt;a href=\"cylinder-head-sector\"&gt;cylinder-head-sector&lt;/a&gt; address due to the interface historical shortcomings. It is converted back to LBA by the &lt;a href=\"disk%20controller\"&gt;disk controller&lt;/a&gt; then, finally, to \"physical\" &lt;a href=\"cylinder%20%28disk%20drive%29\"&gt;cylinder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"disk%20head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"track%20%28disk%20drive%29\"&gt;sector&lt;/a&gt; numbers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Domain%20Name%20System\"&gt;Domain Name System&lt;/a&gt; maps its names to (and from) network-specific addresses (usually IP addresses), which in turn may be mapped to &lt;a href=\"link%20layer\"&gt;link layer&lt;/a&gt; network addresses via &lt;a href=\"Address%20Resolution%20Protocol\"&gt;Address Resolution Protocol&lt;/a&gt;. Also, &lt;a href=\"network%20address%20translation\"&gt;network address translation&lt;/a&gt; may occur on the edge of \"different\" IP spaces, such as a &lt;a href=\"local%20area%20network\"&gt;local area network&lt;/a&gt; and the Internet.\nAn iconic example of virtual-to-physical address translation is &lt;a href=\"virtual%20memory\"&gt;virtual memory&lt;/a&gt;, where different &lt;a href=\"Page%20%28computer%20memory%29\"&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"virtual%20address%20space\"&gt;virtual address space&lt;/a&gt; map either to &lt;a href=\"paging\"&gt;page file&lt;/a&gt; or to main memory &lt;a href=\"physical%20address\"&gt;physical address&lt;/a&gt; space. It is possible that several numerically different virtual addresses all refer to one physical address and hence to the same physical byte of &lt;a href=\"Random%20access%20memory\"&gt;RAM&lt;/a&gt;. It is also possible that a single virtual address maps to zero, one, or &lt;a href=\"CPU%20cache%23Homonym%20and%20synonym%20problems\"&gt;more than one&lt;/a&gt; physical address."
