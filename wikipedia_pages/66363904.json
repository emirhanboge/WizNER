    "text": "D'Iberville was the &lt;a href=\"lead%20ship\"&gt;lead ship&lt;/a&gt; of the of &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20cruiser\"&gt;torpedo cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s built for the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; in the 1890s. The class is also sometimes classified as &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20gunboat\"&gt;torpedo gunboat&lt;/a&gt;s or torpedo &lt;a href=\"aviso\"&gt;aviso&lt;/a&gt;s. The \"D'Iberville\"-class ships were a development of earlier torpedo cruisers, with the chief improvement being a significantly higher speed. \"D'Iberville\" was armed with six &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s and a single gun as her primary offensive armament, though she had all of her torpedo tubes removed in 1896, just two years after entering service.\n\"D'Iberville\" had a fairly limited career, serving with the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Squadron%20%28France%29\"&gt;Mediterranean Squadron&lt;/a&gt; from 1895 to 1897. During this time, her chief activities consisted of annual fleet maneuvers conducted every summer. By 1903, the ship lay at &lt;a href=\"Toulon\"&gt;Toulon&lt;/a&gt; awaiting repairs to her boilers, which had proved troublesome in service. The ship was reactivated for a deployment to &lt;a href=\"French%20Indochina\"&gt;French Indochina&lt;/a&gt; in Southeast Asia by 1911. She was still on station there at the start of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; in August 1914, and she was sent to patrol for German vessels known to be in the area. She was present for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Penang\"&gt;Battle of Penang&lt;/a&gt; in October 1914, where the German &lt;a href=\"light%20cruiser\"&gt;light cruiser&lt;/a&gt; raided the port, sank the Russian &lt;a href=\"protected%20cruiser\"&gt;protected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; , and fled before \"D'Iberville\" or the other warships in the harbor could effectively engage the German vessel. \"D'Iberville\" was later transferred to &lt;a href=\"French%20Algeria\"&gt;French Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, remaining there on patrol duty until 1917. She was ultimately stricken from the &lt;a href=\"naval%20register\"&gt;naval register&lt;/a&gt; in 1919 and sold to &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaker\"&gt;ship breaker&lt;/a&gt;s in 1920.\nDesign.\nIn the early 1880s, the &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt; began building a series of &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20cruiser\"&gt;torpedo cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s to make use of the new, self-propelled &lt;a href=\"Whitehead%20torpedo\"&gt;Whitehead torpedo&lt;/a&gt;. The first classes of these vessels, the and es, were relatively large vessels. Two further classes, the and es, were significantly smaller ships. The three vessels of the \"D'Iberville\" class marked a return to larger vessels, with greatly increased speed compared to their predecessors. All of these ships have been alternatively called torpedo cruisers, &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20gunboat\"&gt;torpedo gunboat&lt;/a&gt;s, or torpedo &lt;a href=\"aviso\"&gt;aviso&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"D'Iberville\" was &lt;a href=\"long%20between%20perpendiculars\"&gt;long between perpendiculars&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . She displaced . Her crew varied from 140 to 143\u00a0officers and enlisted men over the course of her career. The ship's propulsion system consisted of a pair of &lt;a href=\"quadruple-expansion%20steam%20engine\"&gt;quadruple-expansion steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s driving two &lt;a href=\"screw%20propeller\"&gt;screw propeller&lt;/a&gt;s. Steam was provided by eight coal-burning &lt;a href=\"water-tube%20boiler\"&gt;water-tube boiler&lt;/a&gt;s that were ducted into two &lt;a href=\"funnel%20%28ship%29\"&gt;funnels&lt;/a&gt;. Her machinery was rated to produce for a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at .\nThe ship was armed with a &lt;a href=\"main%20battery\"&gt;main battery&lt;/a&gt; of one gun in a &lt;a href=\"pivot%20mount\"&gt;pivot mount&lt;/a&gt; forward. For close-range defense against &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s, she carried three 9-pounder &lt;a href=\"quick-firing%20gun\"&gt;quick-firing gun&lt;/a&gt;s and six or seven &lt;a href=\"QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss\"&gt;3-pounder Hotchkiss guns&lt;/a&gt;, all in individual mounts. She was also armed with six &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s in her &lt;a href=\"hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"waterline\"&gt;waterline&lt;/a&gt;. Armor protection consisted of a curved armor &lt;a href=\"deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; that was thick, along with plating on the conning tower.\nService history.\n\"D'Iberville\" was &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; in August 1891 at the shipyard in &lt;a href=\"Saint-Nazaire\"&gt;Saint-Nazaire&lt;/a&gt;. She was &lt;a href=\"ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 11 September 1892 and was completed in 1894. She completed her &lt;a href=\"sea%20trials\"&gt;sea trials&lt;/a&gt; in June and July that year; on speed tests conducted on 21 July, she reached a speed of . She served with the Mediterranean Squadron in 1895, and she took part in the fleet maneuvers that year, which began on 1 July and concluded on the 27th. She was assigned to \"Fleet C\", which represented the hostile Italian fleet, which was tasked with defeating \"Fleet A\" and \"Fleet B\". The latter two units represented the French fleet, and they were individually inferior to \"Fleet C\", but superior when combined.\nAs a torpedo vessel, \"D'Iberville\" proved to be a disappointment, in part due to severe rolling in heavy seas, and by mid-1896, she had had all of her tubes removed and additional Hotchkiss guns were installed in their places. From 6 to 30 July 1896, the ship participated in the annual fleet maneuvers with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Squadron%20%28France%29\"&gt;Mediterranean Squadron&lt;/a&gt;, serving in the cruiser screen for the 1st Division, along with the &lt;a href=\"armored%20cruiser\"&gt;armored cruiser&lt;/a&gt; , the &lt;a href=\"protected%20cruiser\"&gt;protected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; , and the torpedo cruiser . The ship remained with the cruiser screen for the Mediterranean Fleet in 1897, along with her &lt;a href=\"sister%20ship\"&gt;sister ship&lt;/a&gt; and several other vessels. She participated in the fleet maneuvers that year, which lasted from 7 to 30 July, and included night maneuvers, fleet defense against torpedo boats, and simulated battle between squadrons of battleships. She remained in the unit the following year. \nShe was placed in &lt;a href=\"reserve%20fleet\"&gt;reserve&lt;/a&gt; in 1901. By 1903, the ship lay at Toulon, awaiting repairs to her boilers, along with two dozen other major warships with similarly troublesome boilers. \"D'Iberville\" had been reactivated by 1911 and sent to &lt;a href=\"French%20Indochina\"&gt;French Indochina&lt;/a&gt; to serve with the Naval Division of the Far East. At that time, the unit consisted of the armored cruisers and , three &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, six torpedo boats, and four &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s, along with a number of smaller vessels.\nWorld War I.\nAt the start of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; in August 1914, \"D'Iberville\" was stationed in the Naval Division of the Far East, along with the armored cruisers and \"Dupleix\" and the destroyers , , and . The unit was based in &lt;a href=\"Saigon\"&gt;Saigon&lt;/a&gt; in French Indochina. \"D'Iberville\" and the destroyers were initially sent to patrol the &lt;a href=\"Strait%20of%20Malacca\"&gt;Strait of Malacca&lt;/a&gt; while the armored cruisers were sent north to join the search for the German &lt;a href=\"East%20Asia%20Squadron\"&gt;East Asia Squadron&lt;/a&gt;. \"D'Iberville\" and the destroyers conducted patrols in the strait for the German &lt;a href=\"unprotected%20cruiser\"&gt;unprotected cruiser&lt;/a&gt; , which was known to be passing through the area at the time; the French ships failed to locate the German vessel. On 12 October, the British &lt;a href=\"light%20cruiser\"&gt;light cruiser&lt;/a&gt; seized the Greek-flagged merchant vessel , which had been captured for use as a &lt;a href=\"collier%20%28ship%29\"&gt;collier&lt;/a&gt; by the German light cruiser , which had been detached from the East Asia Squadron. \"Dupleix\" sent \"Pontoporos\" to \"D'Iberville\", which escorted the merchantman to &lt;a href=\"Penang\"&gt;Penang&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"D'Iberville\" and the three destroyers were present in Penang on the night of 27\u201328 October 1914 along with the Russian protected cruiser , when \"Emden\" entered the harbor. The German raider torpedoed and sank \"Zhemchug\" in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Penang\"&gt;Battle of Penang&lt;/a&gt;. The French destroyers were suffering from boiler problems and none had steam up to get underway when \"Emden\" arrived, while \"D'Iberville\" had been undergoing repairs to her engines and was similarly immobilized. \"D'Iberville\"s gunners fired wildly with the ship's light guns in the darkness and failed to score any hits during the brief action. Her 100\u00a0mm guns could not train far enough to engage the German vessel. \"Emden\"s commander decided to attack \"D'Iberville\" next, but before the Germans opened fire, lookouts spotted a vessel entering the harbor at high speed, and \"Emden\" engaged that ship instead. \"Emden\" thereafter slipped back out of the harbor, sinking \"Mousquet\" in the process, and escaped.\n\"D'Iberville\" was later transferred back to home waters, where she was assigned to the Algerian Patrol Division. She served with the unit until 1917. She remained on the navy list until July 1919, when she was struck from the register. The vessel was &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt; the following year."
