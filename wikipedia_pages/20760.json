    "text": "Montenegro (; , , , ; ) is a country in &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Europe\"&gt;Southeastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;. It is located on the &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt; and is a part of the &lt;a href=\"Balkans\"&gt;Balkans&lt;/a&gt;, sharing borders with &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast, &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; to the north and west, &lt;a href=\"Kosovo\"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast, the Adriatic Sea and &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest, and &lt;a href=\"maritime%20boundary\"&gt;maritime boundary&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Podgorica\"&gt;Podgorica&lt;/a&gt;, the capital and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Montenegro\"&gt;largest city&lt;/a&gt;, covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory of , and is home to roughly 30% of its total population of 621,000.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Early%20Medieval\"&gt;Early Medieval&lt;/a&gt; period, three principalities were located on the territory of modern-day Montenegro: &lt;a href=\"Duklja\"&gt;Duklja&lt;/a&gt;, roughly corresponding to the southern half; &lt;a href=\"Travunia\"&gt;Travunia&lt;/a&gt;, the west; and &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Serbia%20%28early%20medieval%29\"&gt;Rascia&lt;/a&gt; proper, the north. The &lt;a href=\"Zeta%20under%20the%20Bal%C5%A1i%C4%87i\"&gt;Principality of Zeta&lt;/a&gt; emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries. From the late 14th century to the late 18th century, large parts of southern Montenegro were ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Venetian%20Republic\"&gt;Venetian Republic&lt;/a&gt; and incorporated into &lt;a href=\"Venetian%20Albania\"&gt;Venetian Albania&lt;/a&gt;. The name Montenegro was first used to refer to the country in the late 15th century. After falling under Ottoman rule, Montenegro regained its independence in 1696 under the rule of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Petrovi%C4%87-Njego%C5%A1\"&gt;House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161&lt;/a&gt;, first as a &lt;a href=\"Prince-Bishopric%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;theocracy&lt;/a&gt; and later as a secular &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;principality&lt;/a&gt;. Montenegro's independence was recognised by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Powers\"&gt;Great Powers&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;Congress of Berlin&lt;/a&gt; in 1878. In 1910, the country became a &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom became part of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"breakup%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;breakup of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, the republics of &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Serbia%20%281992%E2%80%932006%29\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Montenegro%20%281992%E2%80%932006%29\"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; together proclaimed a &lt;a href=\"Serbia%20and%20Montenegro\"&gt;federation&lt;/a&gt;. Following an &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20independence%20referendum%2C%202006\"&gt;independence referendum&lt;/a&gt; held in May 2006, Montenegro declared its independence and the confederation peacefully dissolved.\nMontenegro has an &lt;a href=\"Economy%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;upper middle-income economy&lt;/a&gt; and ranks 48th in the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Development%20Index\"&gt;Human Development Index&lt;/a&gt;. It is a member of the United Nations, &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Trade%20Organization\"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe\"&gt;Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Central%20European%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement\"&gt;Central European Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. Montenegro is also a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20for%20the%20Mediterranean\"&gt;Union for the Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;, and is currently in the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20of%20Montenegro%20to%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;process of joining&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThe country's English name derives from &lt;a href=\"Venetian%20language\"&gt;Venetian&lt;/a&gt; and translates as \"Black Mountain\", deriving from the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Lov%C4%87en\"&gt;Mount Lov\u0107en&lt;/a&gt; when covered in dense evergreen forests. The first written mention of Montenegro in &lt;a href=\"Cyrillic\"&gt;Cyrillic&lt;/a&gt; was in the Charter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Milutin\"&gt;King Milutin&lt;/a&gt; of 1276. In Italian sources, the name of Montenegro was mentioned for the first in its original form Crna Gora in 1348, and in 1379 it is mentioned as Cernagora in the sources from Dubrovnik. In other Italian sources Montenegro is also mentioned as Montagna Negra, Montenegro or Monte Negro and therefrom this designation came into all Western European languages. In the monuments of &lt;a href=\"Kotor\"&gt;Kotor&lt;/a&gt;, Montenegro was mentioned as Montenegro in 1397, as Monte Nigro in 1443 and as Crna Gora in 1435 and 1458, but there are much older papers of Latin sources where Montenegro is mentioned as Monte nigro. The first mention of Montenegro (Latin) dates to 9 November 1053 and the others date to 1061, 1097, 1121, 1125, 1144, 1154, 1179 and 1189.\nThe native name \"Crna Gora,\" also meaning \"black mountain\" or \"black hill\", was mentioned for the first time in a charter issued by &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Milutin\"&gt;Stefan Milutin&lt;/a&gt;. It came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century. Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the &lt;a href=\"Pa%C5%A1trovi%C4%87i\"&gt;Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i&lt;/a&gt; tribe, but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the &lt;a href=\"Crnojevi%C4%87%20noble%20family\"&gt;Crnojevi\u0107 noble family&lt;/a&gt; took power in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Zeta\"&gt;Upper Zeta&lt;/a&gt;. The aforementioned region became known as \"Stara Crna Gora\" '&lt;a href=\"Old%20Montenegro\"&gt;Old Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of \"Brda\" '(The) Highlands'. Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which saw the annexation of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Old Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; and parts of &lt;a href=\"Metohija\"&gt;Metohija&lt;/a&gt; and southern &lt;a href=\"Ra%C5%A1ka%20%28region%29\"&gt;Ra\u0161ka&lt;/a&gt;. Its borders have changed little since then, losing &lt;a href=\"Metohija\"&gt;Metohija&lt;/a&gt; and gaining the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Kotor\"&gt;Bay of Kotor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the second session of the &lt;a href=\"Anti-Fascist%20Council%20for%20the%20National%20Liberation%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;AVNOJ&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II%20in%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;World War II in Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, the contemporary modern state of Montenegro was founded as the \"Federal State of Montenegro\" (&lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20language\"&gt;Montenegrin&lt;/a&gt;: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435 / \"Savezna dr\u017eava Crne Gore\") on 15 November 1943 within the Yugoslav Federation by the &lt;a href=\"State%20Anti-fascist%20Council%20for%20the%20National%20Liberation%20of%20Montenegro%20and%20Boka\"&gt;ZAVNOCGB&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, Montenegro became a republic under its name, the \"&lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;People's Republic of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20language\"&gt;Montenegrin&lt;/a&gt;: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / \"Narodna Republika Crna Gora\") on 29 November 1945. In 1963, it was renamed to the \"Socialist Republic of Montenegro\" (&lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20language\"&gt;Montenegrin&lt;/a&gt;: \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / \"Socijalisti\u010dka Republika Crna Gora\"). As the &lt;a href=\"breakup%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;breakup of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; occurred, the SRCG was renamed to the \"Republic of Montenegro\" (&lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20language\"&gt;Montenegrin&lt;/a&gt;: \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / \"Republika Crna Gora\") on 27 April 1992 within the &lt;a href=\"Serbia%20and%20Montenegro\"&gt;Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; by removing the adjective \"socialist\" from the republic's title. Since 22 October 2007, a year after its independence, the name of the country became simply known as \"Montenegro\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"ISO%203166-1%20alpha-2\"&gt;ISO Alpha-2&lt;/a&gt; code for Montenegro is ME and the &lt;a href=\"ISO%203166-1%20alpha-3\"&gt;Alpha-3 Code&lt;/a&gt; is MNE.\nHistory.\nArrival of the Slavs.\nThree &lt;a href=\"Slavs\"&gt;Slavic&lt;/a&gt; principalities were located on the territory: &lt;a href=\"Duklja\"&gt;Duklja&lt;/a&gt;, roughly corresponding to the southern half, &lt;a href=\"Travunia\"&gt;Travunia&lt;/a&gt;, the west, and &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Serbia%20%28early%20medieval%29\"&gt;Ra\u0161ka&lt;/a&gt;, the north. Duklja gained its independence from the Byzantine Roman Empire in 1042. Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia, and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), several civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, &lt;a href=\"Mihailo%20I%20of%20Duklja\"&gt;Mihailo&lt;/a&gt; (1046\u201381), and his grandson &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20Bodin\"&gt;Constantine Bodin&lt;/a&gt; (1081\u20131101).\nAs the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, the territory of modern-day Montenegro became part of the state ruled by &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Nemanja\"&gt;Stefan Nemanja&lt;/a&gt; and was a part of various state formations ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Nemanji%C4%87%20dynasty\"&gt;Nemanji\u0107 dynasty&lt;/a&gt; for the next two centuries. After the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Empire\"&gt;Serbian Empire&lt;/a&gt; collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the &lt;a href=\"Bal%C5%A1i%C4%87\"&gt;Bal\u0161i\u0107&lt;/a&gt;s, became sovereigns of Zeta.\nBy the 13th century, \"Zeta\" had replaced \"Duklja\" when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro (&lt;a href=\"Lordship%20of%20Zeta\"&gt;Zeta&lt;/a&gt;) came under the rule of the &lt;a href=\"Bal%C5%A1i%C4%87%20noble%20family\"&gt;Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"Crnojevi%C4%87%20noble%20family\"&gt;Crnojevi\u0107 noble family&lt;/a&gt;, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as \"Crna Gora\" (&lt;a href=\"Venetian%20language\"&gt;Venetian&lt;/a&gt;: \"\").\nIn 1421, Zeta was annexed to the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Despotate\"&gt;Serbian Despotate&lt;/a&gt;, but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the &lt;a href=\"Crnojevi%C4%87\"&gt;Crnojevi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;s, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the &lt;a href=\"Ottomans\"&gt;Ottomans&lt;/a&gt; in 1496, and got annexed to the \"&lt;a href=\"sanjak\"&gt;sanjak&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Shkod%C3%ABr\"&gt;Shkod\u00ebr&lt;/a&gt;. During the reign of Crnojevi\u0107s, Zeta became known under its current name\u00a0\u2013 Montenegro. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous \"sanjak\" in 1514\u20131528 (&lt;a href=\"Sanjak%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Sanjak of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;). Also, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Old Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; region was part of &lt;a href=\"Sanjak%20of%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Sanjak of Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly modern period.\nFrom 1392, numerous parts of the territory that is now Montenegro were controlled by &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Venice\"&gt;Republic of Venice&lt;/a&gt;, including the city of &lt;a href=\"Budva\"&gt;Budva&lt;/a&gt;, in that time known as \"Budua\". The Venetian territory was centred on the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Kotor\"&gt;Bay of Kotor&lt;/a&gt;, and the Republic also introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics. Venice would control territories in present-day Montenegro until &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Venice\"&gt;its fall&lt;/a&gt; in 1797.\nLarge portions fell under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; from 1496 to 1878. In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire permitting Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, raised numerous rebellions, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Turkish%20War\"&gt;Great Turkish War&lt;/a&gt; at the end of that century.\nMontenegro consisted of territories controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (\"knez\"), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. The great assembly of Montenegrin clans (\"Zbor\") was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part. In 1515, Montenegro became a &lt;a href=\"theocracy\"&gt;theocracy&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitanate%20of%20Montenegro%20and%20the%20Littoral\"&gt;Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral&lt;/a&gt;, which flourished after the &lt;a href=\"Petrovi%C4%87-Njego%C5%A1\"&gt;Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161&lt;/a&gt; of Cetinje became the traditional prince-bishops (whose title was \"Vladika of Montenegro\").\nPeople from Montenegro in this historical period have been described as Orthodox Serbs.\nPrincipality and Kingdom of Montenegro.\nIn 1858, one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grahovac\"&gt;Battle of Grahovac&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mirko%20Petrovi%C4%87%20Njego%C5%A1\"&gt;Grand Duke Mirko Petrovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, elder brother of &lt;a href=\"Knjaz%20Danilo\"&gt;Knjaz Danilo&lt;/a&gt;, led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans with 15,000 troops at &lt;a href=\"Grahovac\"&gt;Grahovac&lt;/a&gt; on 1 May 1858. This forced the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Powers\"&gt;Great Powers&lt;/a&gt; to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, \"de facto\" recognizing Montenegro's independence.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Vu%C4%8Dji%20Do\"&gt;Battle of Vu\u010dji Do&lt;/a&gt; Montenegrins inflicted major defeat to the Ottoman Army under Grand Vizier &lt;a href=\"Ahmed%20Muhtar%20Pasha\"&gt;Ahmed Muhtar Pasha&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of the Russian victory against the Ottoman Empire in the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Turkish%20War%20of%201877%E2%80%931878\"&gt;Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"great%20powers%20of%20Europe\"&gt;major powers&lt;/a&gt; restructured the map of the Balkan region. The Ottoman Empire recognised the independence of Montenegro in the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Berlin%20%281878%29\"&gt;Treaty of Berlin&lt;/a&gt; in 1878.\nThe first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20I%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Nicholas I&lt;/a&gt; (ruled 1860\u20131918), the &lt;a href=\"principality\"&gt;principality&lt;/a&gt; was enlarged several times in the Montenegro-Turkish Wars and was recognised as independent in 1878. Nicholas I established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire. \nMinor border skirmishes excepted, diplomacy ushered in about 30 years of peace between the two states until the deposition of &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20Hamid%20II\"&gt;Abdul Hamid II&lt;/a&gt; in 1909.\nThe political skills of Abdul Hamid II and Nicholas I played a major role in the mutually amicable relations. Modernization of the state followed, culminating with the draft of a Constitution in 1905. However, political rifts emerged between the reigning &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;People's Party&lt;/a&gt;, who supported the process of democratisation and union with Serbia, and those of the &lt;a href=\"True%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;True People's Party&lt;/a&gt;, who were monarchist.\nIn 1910, Montenegro became &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;a kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20wars\"&gt;Balkan wars&lt;/a&gt; in 1912 and 1913, a common border with Serbia was established, with &lt;a href=\"Shkod%C3%ABr\"&gt;Shkod\u00ebr&lt;/a&gt; being awarded to &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;, though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia. Montenegro became one of the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Allied Powers&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; (1914\u201318). In the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mojkovac\"&gt;Battle of Mojkovac&lt;/a&gt; fought in January 1916 between &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt; and the Kingdom of Montenegro, Montenegrins achieved decisive victory despite being outnumbered five to one. From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and a government-in-exile was set up in &lt;a href=\"Bordeaux\"&gt;Bordeaux&lt;/a&gt;.\nKingdom of Yugoslavia.\nIn 1922, Montenegro formally became the &lt;a href=\"Zeta%20Oblast\"&gt;Oblast of Cetinje&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Serbs%2C%20Croats%20and%20Slovenes\"&gt;Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&lt;/a&gt;, with the addition of the coastal areas around &lt;a href=\"Budva\"&gt;Budva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Kotor\"&gt;Bay of Kotor&lt;/a&gt;. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger &lt;a href=\"Zeta%20Banovina\"&gt;Zeta Banate&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; that reached the &lt;a href=\"Neretva\"&gt;Neretva&lt;/a&gt; River.\nNicholas's grandson, the Serb King &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Alexander I&lt;/a&gt;, dominated the Yugoslav government. &lt;a href=\"Zeta%20Banovina\"&gt;Zeta Banovina&lt;/a&gt; was one of nine banovinas that formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.\nWorld War II and Socialist Yugoslavia.\nIn April 1941, &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Italy\"&gt;Kingdom of Italy&lt;/a&gt;, and other Axis allies attacked and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italian forces occupied Montenegro and established it as a puppet &lt;a href=\"Italian%20governorate%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Kingdom of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for &lt;a href=\"guerrilla%20warfare\"&gt;guerrilla warfare&lt;/a&gt;. According to some historians, the first armed uprising in &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt;-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.\nUnexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nik\u0161i\u0107), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.\nFighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included &lt;a href=\"Arso%20Jovanovi%C4%87\"&gt;Arso Jovanovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sava%20Kova%C4%8Devi%C4%87%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisan%29\"&gt;Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Svetozar%20Vukmanovi%C4%87-Tempo\"&gt;Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Milovan%20%C4%90ilas\"&gt;Milovan \u0110ilas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peko%20Dap%C4%8Devi%C4%87\"&gt;Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vlado%20Dap%C4%8Devi%C4%87\"&gt;Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veljko%20Vlahovi%C4%87\"&gt;Veljko Vlahovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bla%C5%BEo%20Jovanovi%C4%87\"&gt;Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. Those loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Kara%C4%91or%C4%91evi%C4%87%20dynasty\"&gt;Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and opposing communism went on to become &lt;a href=\"Chetniks\"&gt;Chetniks&lt;/a&gt;, and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.\nWar broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of \"anti-communist militia\" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to &lt;a href=\"Mostar\"&gt;Mostar&lt;/a&gt;, where they fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Neretva\"&gt;Battle of Neretva&lt;/a&gt; against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.\nDuring the German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed a large number of Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon &lt;a href=\"German%20occupied%20territory%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;occupied by German forces&lt;/a&gt;, and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and entire 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.\nMontenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed &lt;a href=\"Podgorica\"&gt;Titograd&lt;/a&gt; in honour of President &lt;a href=\"Josip%20Broz%20Tito\"&gt;Josip Broz Tito&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;University of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; was established. Greater autonomy was established until the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Socialist Republic of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; ratified a new constitution in 1974.\nMontenegro within FR Yugoslavia.\nAfter the dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro remained part of a smaller &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt; along with Serbia.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20independence%20referendum%2C%201992\"&gt;referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992&lt;/a&gt;, the turnout was 66%, with 96% of the votes cast in favour of the federation with Serbia. The referendum was &lt;a href=\"boycott\"&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt;ed by the Muslim, Albanian, and Catholic minorities, as well as the pro-independence Montenegrins. The opponents claimed that the poll was organised under anti-&lt;a href=\"Democracy\"&gt;democratic conditions&lt;/a&gt; with widespread propaganda from the state-controlled media in favour of a pro-federation vote. No impartial report on the fairness of the referendum was made, as it was unmonitored, unlike in a later 2006 referendum when &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; observers were present.\nDuring the 1991\u20131995 &lt;a href=\"Bosnian%20War\"&gt;Bosnian War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20War\"&gt;Croatian War&lt;/a&gt;, Montenegrin police and military forces joined Serbian troops in the attacks on &lt;a href=\"Dubrovnik\"&gt;Dubrovnik&lt;/a&gt;, Croatia. These operations, aimed at acquiring more territory, were characterised by a consistent pattern of large-scale violations of human rights.\nMontenegrin General &lt;a href=\"Pavle%20Strugar\"&gt;Pavle Strugar&lt;/a&gt; was convicted for his part in the bombing of Dubrovnik.\nBosnian refugees were arrested by Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in &lt;a href=\"Fo%C4%8Da%20ethnic%20cleansing\"&gt;Fo\u010da&lt;/a&gt;, where they were subjected to systematic torture and executed.\nIn 1996, &lt;a href=\"Milo%20%C4%90ukanovi%C4%87\"&gt;Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;'s government severed ties between Montenegro and its partner Serbia, which was led by &lt;a href=\"Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87\"&gt;Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;. Montenegro formed its own &lt;a href=\"economic%20policy\"&gt;economic policy&lt;/a&gt; and adopted the German &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Mark\"&gt;Deutsche Mark&lt;/a&gt; as its currency and subsequently &lt;a href=\"Montenegro%20and%20the%20euro\"&gt;adopted the euro&lt;/a&gt;, although not part of the &lt;a href=\"Eurozone\"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent governments pursued pro-independence policies, and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite the political changes in &lt;a href=\"Belgrade\"&gt;Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;.\nTargets in Montenegro were bombed by NATO forces during &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Allied%20Force\"&gt;Operation Allied Force&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, although the extent of these attacks was limited in both time and area affected.\nIn 2002, Serbia and Montenegro came to a new agreement for continued cooperation and entered into negotiations regarding the future status of the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia\"&gt;Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. This resulted in the Belgrade Agreement, which saw the country's transformation into a more decentralised state union named &lt;a href=\"Serbia%20and%20Montenegro\"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. The Belgrade Agreement also contained a provision delaying any future referendum on the independence of Montenegro for at least three years.\nIndependence.\nThe status of the union between Montenegro and Serbia was decided by a &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20independence%20referendum%2C%202006\"&gt;referendum on Montenegrin independence&lt;/a&gt; on 21 May 2006. A total of 419,240 votes were cast, representing 86.5% of the total electorate; 230,661 votes (55.5%) were for independence and 185,002 votes (44.5%) were against. This narrowly surpassed the 55% threshold needed to validate the referendum under the rules set by the European Union. According to the electoral commission, the 55% threshold was passed by only 2,300 votes. Serbia, the member-states of the European Union, and the &lt;a href=\"permanent%20members%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20Security%20Council\"&gt;permanent members of the United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; all &lt;a href=\"diplomatic%20recognition\"&gt;recognised&lt;/a&gt; Montenegro's independence.\nThe 2006 referendum was monitored by five international observer missions, headed by an &lt;a href=\"Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe\"&gt;OSCE&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Office%20for%20Democratic%20Institutions%20and%20Human%20Rights\"&gt;ODIHR&lt;/a&gt; team, and around 3,000 observers in total (including domestic observers from &lt;a href=\"Center%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Technology\"&gt;CDT&lt;/a&gt; (OSCE PA), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe (CLRAE), and the European Parliament (EP) to form an International Referendum Observation Mission (IROM). The IROM\u2014in its preliminary report\u2014\"assessed compliance of the referendum process with OSCE commitments, Council of Europe commitments, other international standards for democratic electoral processes, and domestic legislation.\" Furthermore, the report stated that the competitive pre-referendum environment was marked by an active and generally peaceful campaign and that \"there were no reports of restrictions on fundamental civil and political rights.\"\nOn 3 June 2006, the Montenegrin Parliament declared the independence of Montenegro, formally confirming the result of the referendum.\nOn 28 June 2006, Montenegro joined the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; as 192nd member state.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Law%20on%20the%20Status%20of%20the%20Descendants%20of%20the%20Petrovi%C4%87%20Njego%C5%A1%20Dynasty\"&gt;Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161 Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; was passed by the Parliament of Montenegro on 12 July 2011. It rehabilitated the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Petrovi%C4%87-Njego%C5%A1\"&gt;Royal House of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; and recognised limited symbolic roles within the constitutional framework of the republic.\nIn 2015, the investigative journalists' network &lt;a href=\"Organized%20Crime%20and%20Corruption%20Reporting%20Project\"&gt;OCCRP&lt;/a&gt; named Montenegro's long-time President and Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Milo%20%C4%90ukanovi%C4%87\"&gt;Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; \"Person of the Year in Organized Crime\". The extent of \u0110ukanovi\u0107's corruption led to street demonstrations and calls for his removal.\nIn October 2016, for the day of the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202016\"&gt;parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempt\"&gt;coup d'\u00e9tat was prepared&lt;/a&gt; by a group of persons that included leaders of the Montenegrin opposition, Serbian nationals and Russian agents; the coup was prevented. In 2017, fourteen people, including two Russian nationals and two Montenegrin opposition leaders, &lt;a href=\"Andrija%20Mandi%C4%87\"&gt;Andrija Mandi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Milan%20Kne%C5%BEevi%C4%87%20%28Montenegrin%20politician%29\"&gt;Milan Kne\u017eevi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, were indicted for their alleged roles in the coup attempt on charges such as \"preparing a conspiracy against the constitutional order and the security of Montenegro\" and an \"attempted terrorist act.\"\nRecent history.\nMontenegro formally &lt;a href=\"Montenegro%E2%80%93NATO%20relations\"&gt;became a member&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; in June 2017, though \"Montenegro remains deeply divided over joining NATO\", an event that triggered a promise of retaliatory actions on the part of Russia's government.\nMontenegro has been in &lt;a href=\"Accession%20of%20Montenegro%20to%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;negotiations&lt;/a&gt; with the EU since 2012. In 2018, the earlier goal of acceding by 2022 was revised to 2025.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2019%20Montenegrin%20anti-corruption%20protests\"&gt;Montenegrin anti-corruption protests&lt;/a&gt; began in February 2019 against the incumbent President &lt;a href=\"Milo%20%C4%90ukanovi%C4%87\"&gt;Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt; and the Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Du%C5%A1ko%20Markovi%C4%87\"&gt;Du\u0161ko Markovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Montenegro%23Markovi%C4%87%20Cabinet%20%282016-present%29\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; of the ruling &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20of%20Socialists\"&gt;Democratic Party of Socialists&lt;/a&gt; (DPS), which has been in power since 1991.\nAs of late December 2019, the newly adopted Law on Religion, which &lt;a href=\"de%20jure\"&gt;de jure&lt;/a&gt; transfers the ownership of church buildings and estates built before 1918 from the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Serbian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; to the Montenegrin state, sparked a series of large &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%932020%20clerical%20protests%20in%20Montenegro\"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; followed with road blockages. Seventeen opposition &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Front%20%28Montenegro%29\"&gt;Democratic Front&lt;/a&gt; MPs were arrested prior to the voting for disrupting the vote. Demonstrations continued into March 2020 as peaceful protest walks, mostly organised by the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitanate%20of%20Montenegro%20and%20the%20Littoral\"&gt;Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eparchy%20of%20Budimlja%20and%20Nik%C5%A1i%C4%87\"&gt;Eparchy of Budimlja and Nik\u0161i\u0107&lt;/a&gt; in the majority of Montenegrin municipalities.\nIn its political rights and civil liberties worldwide report in May 2020, &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20House\"&gt;Freedom House&lt;/a&gt; marked Montenegro as a &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20regime\"&gt;hybrid regime&lt;/a&gt; rather than a democracy because of declining standards in governance, justice, elections, and media freedom. For the first time in three decades, in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Montenegrin%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2020 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt;, the opposition won more votes than \u0110ukanovi\u0107's ruling party.\nGeography.\nMontenegro ranges from high peaks along its borders with Serbia, &lt;a href=\"Kosovo\"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;, and Albania, a segment of the &lt;a href=\"Karst\"&gt;Karst&lt;/a&gt; of the western Balkan Peninsula, to a narrow coastal plain that is only wide. The plain stops abruptly in the north, where &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Lov%C4%87en\"&gt;Mount Lov\u0107en&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Orjen\"&gt;Mount Orjen&lt;/a&gt; plunge into the inlet of the Bay of Kotor.\nMontenegro's large karst region lies generally at elevations of above sea level; some parts, however, rise to , such as &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Orjen\"&gt;Mount Orjen&lt;/a&gt; (), the highest massif among the coastal limestone ranges. The &lt;a href=\"Zeta%20River\"&gt;Zeta River&lt;/a&gt; valley, at an elevation of , is the lowest segment.\nThe mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrains in Europe, averaging more than in elevation. One of the country's notable peaks is &lt;a href=\"Bobotov%20Kuk\"&gt;Bobotov Kuk&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Durmitor\"&gt;Durmitor&lt;/a&gt; mountains, which reaches a height of . Owing to the hyperhumid climate on their western sides, the Montenegrin mountain ranges were among the most ice-eroded parts of the Balkan Peninsula during the last glacial period.\nInternationally, Montenegro borders &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina\"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kosovo\"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albania\"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Croatia\"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; . It lies between latitudes &lt;a href=\"41st%20parallel%20north\"&gt;41\u00b0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"44th%20parallel%20north\"&gt;44\u00b0N&lt;/a&gt;, and longitudes &lt;a href=\"18th%20meridian%20east\"&gt;18\u00b0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"21st%20meridian%20east\"&gt;21\u00b0E&lt;/a&gt;.\nMontenegro is a member of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Commission%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20the%20Danube%20River\"&gt;International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River&lt;/a&gt;, as more than of the country's territory lie within the &lt;a href=\"Danube\"&gt;Danube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drainage%20basin\"&gt;catchment area&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiodiversity.\nThe diversity of the geological base, landscape, climate, and soil, and the position of Montenegro on the Balkan Peninsula and Adriatic Sea, created the conditions for high biological diversity, putting Montenegro among the \"hot-spots\" of European and world biodiversity. The number of species per area unit index in Montenegro is 0.837, which is the highest index recorded in any European country.\nBiological estimates suggest that over 1,200 species of freshwater algae, 300 species of marine algae, 589 species of moss, 7,000-8,000 species of vascular plants, 2,000 species of fungi, 16,000-20,000 species of insects, 407 species of marine fish, 56 species of reptile, 333 species of regularly visiting birds and a high species diversity of mammals are found in Montenegro.\nMontenegro can be divided into two main &lt;a href=\"Biogeography\"&gt;biogeographic&lt;/a&gt; regions, which include the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Biogeographic%20Region\"&gt;Mediterranean Biogeographic Region&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alpine%20Biogeographic%20Region\"&gt;Alpine Biogeographic Region&lt;/a&gt;. It is also home to three terrestrial ecoregions: &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20mixed%20forests\"&gt;Balkan mixed forests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dinaric%20Mountains%20mixed%20forests\"&gt;Dinaric Mountains mixed forests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Illyrian%20deciduous%20forests\"&gt;Illyrian deciduous forests&lt;/a&gt;. It had a 2019 &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Landscape%20Integrity%20Index\"&gt;Forest Landscape Integrity Index&lt;/a&gt; mean score of 6.41/10, ranking it 73rd globally out of 172 countries.\nThe total share of protected areas in Montenegro is 9.05% of the country's area, which mainly comes from the five &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20national%20parks%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;national parks of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernment and politics.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Constitution of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; describes the state as a \"&lt;a href=\"Civic%20engagement\"&gt;civic&lt;/a&gt;, democratic, &lt;a href=\"environmentalism\"&gt;ecological&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href=\"social%20justice\"&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt;, based on the &lt;a href=\"rule%20of%20law\"&gt;reign of Law&lt;/a&gt;.\" Montenegro is an independent and sovereign republic that proclaimed its new constitution on 22 October 2007.\nThe &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;President of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt;, elected for a period of five years through direct elections. The President represents the country abroad, promulgates laws by ordinance, calls elections for the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, and proposes candidates for &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, president and justices of the Constitutional Court to the Parliament. The President also proposes the calling of a &lt;a href=\"referendum\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; to Parliament, grants amnesty for criminal offences prescribed by the national law, confers decoration and awards and performs other constitutional duties and is a member of the Supreme Defence Council. The official residence of the President is in &lt;a href=\"Cetinje\"&gt;Cetinje&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Government of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Executive%20%28government%29\"&gt;executive branch&lt;/a&gt; of government authority of Montenegro. The government is headed by the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; and consists of the deputy prime ministers as well as ministers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Parliament of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"unicameral\"&gt;unicameral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Legislature\"&gt;legislative&lt;/a&gt; body. It passes laws, ratifies treaties, appoints the Prime Minister, ministers, and justices of all courts, adopts the budget and performs other duties as established by the Constitution. Parliament can pass a vote of no-confidence in the Government by a simple majority. One representative is elected per 6,000 voters.\nIn 2019, the &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20House\"&gt;Freedom House&lt;/a&gt; reported that years of increasing &lt;a href=\"state%20capture\"&gt;state capture&lt;/a&gt;, abuse of power, and strongman tactics employed by the President \u0110ukanovi\u0107 have tipped his country over the edge \u2013 for the first time since 2003, Montenegro is no longer categorised as democracy and became a &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20regime\"&gt;hybrid regime&lt;/a&gt;. The DPS narrowly lost the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Montenegrin%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2020 Montenegrin parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt;, ending its 30-year rule.\nForeign relations.\nAfter the promulgation of the Declaration of Independence in the Parliament of the Republic of Montenegro on 3 June 2006, following the independence referendum held on 21 May, the Government of the Republic of Montenegro assumed the competencies of defining and conducting the foreign policy of Montenegro as a subject of international law and a &lt;a href=\"sovereign%20state\"&gt;sovereign state&lt;/a&gt;. The implementation of this constitutional responsibility was vested in the Ministry of &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Affairs\"&gt;Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, which was given the task of defining the foreign policy priorities and activities needed for their implementation.\nThese activities are pursued in close cooperation with other state administration authorities, the President, the Speaker of the Parliament, and other relevant stakeholders.\nIntegration into the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; is Montenegro's strategic goal. This process will remain in the focus of Montenegrin foreign policy in the short term.\nThe second strategic and equally important goal, but one attainable in a shorter time span, was joining &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;, which would guarantee stability and security for pursuing other strategic goals. Montenegro believes NATO integration would speed up EU integration. In May 2017 NATO accepted Montenegro as a NATO member starting 5 June 2017.\nSymbols.\nAn official &lt;a href=\"flag%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;flag of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, based on the royal standard of &lt;a href=\"King%20Nicholas%20I\"&gt;King Nicholas I&lt;/a&gt;, was adopted on 12 July 2004 by the Montenegrin legislature. This royal flag was red with a silver border, a silver coat of arms, and the initials \u041d\u0406, in Cyrillic script (corresponding to NI in Latin script), representing King Nicholas I. On the current flag, the border and arms are in gold and the royal cipher in the centre of the arms has been replaced with a golden lion.\nThe national day of &lt;a href=\"Statehood%20Day%20%28Montenegro%29\"&gt;13 July&lt;/a&gt; marks the date in 1878 when the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;Congress of Berlin&lt;/a&gt; recognised Montenegro as the 27th independent state in the world and the start of one of the first popular uprisings in Europe against the &lt;a href=\"Axis%20Powers\"&gt;Axis Powers&lt;/a&gt; on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.\nIn 2004, the Montenegrin legislature selected a popular Montenegrin traditional song, \"&lt;a href=\"Oj%2C%20svijetla%20majska%20zoro\"&gt;Oh, Bright Dawn of May&lt;/a&gt;\", as the &lt;a href=\"national%20anthem\"&gt;national anthem&lt;/a&gt;. Montenegro's official anthem during the reign of King Nicholas I was \"&lt;a href=\"Ubavoj%20nam%20Crnoj%20Gori\"&gt;Ubavoj nam Crnoj Gori&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"To Our Beautiful Montenegro\").\nMilitary.\nThe &lt;a href=\"military%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;military of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; is a fully professional &lt;a href=\"standing%20army\"&gt;standing army&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Montenegro%29\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; and is composed of the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20Ground%20Army\"&gt;Montenegrin Ground Army&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20Navy\"&gt;Montenegrin Navy&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Montenegrin Air Force&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"special%20forces\"&gt;special forces&lt;/a&gt;. Conscription was abolished in 2006. The military currently maintains a force of 1,920 active duty members. The bulk of its equipment and forces were inherited from the armed forces of the State Union of &lt;a href=\"Serbia%20and%20Montenegro\"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;; as Montenegro contained the entire &lt;a href=\"coastline\"&gt;coastline&lt;/a&gt; of the former union, it retained practically the entire naval force.\nMontenegro was a member of NATO's &lt;a href=\"Partnership%20for%20Peace\"&gt;Partnership for Peace&lt;/a&gt; program and then became an official candidate for full membership in the alliance. Montenegro applied for a &lt;a href=\"Membership%20Action%20Plan\"&gt;Membership Action Plan&lt;/a&gt; on 5 November 2008, which was granted in December 2009. Montenegro is also a member of &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Charter\"&gt;Adriatic Charter&lt;/a&gt;. Montenegro was invited to join &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; on 2 December 2015 and on 19 May 2016, NATO and Montenegro conducted a signing ceremony at NATO headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; for Montenegro's membership invitation. Montenegro became NATO's 29th &lt;a href=\"Member%20states%20of%20NATO\"&gt;member&lt;/a&gt; on 5 June 2017, despite Russia's objections. The government plans to have the army participate in &lt;a href=\"peacekeeping\"&gt;peacekeeping&lt;/a&gt; missions through the UN and NATO such as the &lt;a href=\"International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force\"&gt;International Security Assistance Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdministrative divisions.\nMontenegro is divided into twenty-four municipalities (\"&lt;a href=\"op%C5%A1tina\"&gt;op\u0161tina&lt;/a&gt;\"). This includes 21 District-level Municipalities and 2 Urban Municipalities, with two subdivisions of &lt;a href=\"municipality%20of%20Podgorica\"&gt;Podgorica municipality&lt;/a&gt;, listed below. Each municipality can contain multiple cities and towns. Historically, the territory of the country was divided into \"nahije\".\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Montenegro is mostly &lt;a href=\"Tertiary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy\"&gt;service-based&lt;/a&gt; and is in &lt;a href=\"Transition%20economy\"&gt;late transition&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"market%20economy\"&gt;market economy&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href=\"International%20Monetary%20Fund\"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"nominal%20GDP\"&gt;nominal GDP&lt;/a&gt; of Montenegro was $5.424\u00a0billion in 2019. The &lt;a href=\"Purchasing%20power%20parity\"&gt;GDP PPP&lt;/a&gt; for 2019 was $12.516\u00a0billion, or $20,083 per capita. According to &lt;a href=\"Eurostat\"&gt;Eurostat&lt;/a&gt; data, the Montenegrin GDP per capita stood at 48% of the EU average in 2018. The &lt;a href=\"Central%20Bank%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Central Bank of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; is not part of the euro system but the country is \"&lt;a href=\"euroisation\"&gt;euroised&lt;/a&gt;\", using &lt;a href=\"Montenegro%20and%20the%20euro\"&gt;the euro unilaterally&lt;/a&gt; as its currency.\nGDP grew at 10.7% in 2007 and 7.5% in 2008. The country entered a &lt;a href=\"recession\"&gt;recession&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 as a part of the &lt;a href=\"late-2000s%20recession\"&gt;global recession&lt;/a&gt;, with GDP contracting by 4%. However, Montenegro remained a target for &lt;a href=\"foreign%20direct%20investment\"&gt;foreign investment&lt;/a&gt;, the only country in the Balkans to increase its amount of direct foreign investment. The country exited the recession in mid-2010, with GDP growth at around 0.5%. However, the significant dependence of the Montenegrin economy on &lt;a href=\"foreign%20direct%20investment\"&gt;foreign direct investment&lt;/a&gt; leaves it susceptible to external shocks and a high export/import trade deficit.\nIn 2007, the &lt;a href=\"service%20sector\"&gt;service sector&lt;/a&gt; made up 72.4% of GDP, with industry and agriculture making up the rest at 17.6% and 10%, respectively. There are 50,000 farming households in Montenegro that rely on agriculture to fill the family budget.\nInfrastructure.\nThe Montenegrin road infrastructure is not yet at Western European standards. Despite an extensive road network, no roads are built to full motorway standards. Construction of new motorways is considered a national priority, as they are important for uniform regional economic development and the development of Montenegro as an attractive tourist destination.\nCurrent &lt;a href=\"European%20route\"&gt;European route&lt;/a&gt;s that pass through Montenegro are &lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E65\"&gt;E65&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20route%20E80\"&gt;E80&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe backbone of the Montenegrin rail network is the &lt;a href=\"Belgrade%E2%80%93Bar%20railway\"&gt;Belgrade\u2013Bar railway&lt;/a&gt;, which provides international connection towards &lt;a href=\"Serbia\"&gt;Serbia&lt;/a&gt;. There is a domestic branch line, the &lt;a href=\"Nik%C5%A1i%C4%87-Podgorica%20railway\"&gt;Nik\u0161i\u0107-Podgorica railway&lt;/a&gt;, which was operated as a freight-only line for decades, and is now also open for passenger traffic after the reconstruction and electrification works in 2012. The other branch line from Podgorica towards the Albanian border, the &lt;a href=\"Podgorica%E2%80%93Shkod%C3%ABr%20railway\"&gt;Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway&lt;/a&gt;, is not in use.\nMontenegro has two international airports, &lt;a href=\"Podgorica%20Airport\"&gt;Podgorica Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tivat%20Airport\"&gt;Tivat Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The two airports served 1.1\u00a0million passengers in 2008.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Bar\"&gt;Port of Bar&lt;/a&gt; is Montenegro's main seaport. Initially built in 1906, the port was almost completely destroyed during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, with reconstruction beginning in 1950. Today, it is equipped to handle over 5 million tons of cargo annually, though the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and the size of the Montenegrin industrial sector has resulted in the port operating at a loss and well below capacity for several years. The reconstruction of the &lt;a href=\"Belgrade-Bar%20railway\"&gt;Belgrade-Bar railway&lt;/a&gt; and the proposed &lt;a href=\"Belgrade-Bar%20motorway\"&gt;Belgrade-Bar motorway&lt;/a&gt; are expected to bring the port back up to capacity.\nTourism.\nWith a total of 1.6\u00a0million visitors, Montenegro is the 36th most visited country (out of 47 countries) in Europe. The majority of foreign visitors to Montenegro come from the neighbouring countries of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, as well as Russia. The Montenegrin &lt;a href=\"Adriatic\"&gt;Adriatic&lt;/a&gt; coast is long, with of beaches and many well-preserved ancient old towns. Some of the most popular beaches on the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20Littoral\"&gt;Montenegrin coast&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href=\"Jaz%20Beach\"&gt;Jaz Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Budva\"&gt;Mogren Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Be%C4%8Di%C4%87i\"&gt;Be\u010di\u0107i Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sveti%20Stefan\"&gt;Sveti Stefan Beach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velika%20Pla%C5%BEa\"&gt;Velika Pla\u017ea&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, some of the most popular ancient Montenegrin towns include &lt;a href=\"Herceg%20Novi\"&gt;Herceg Novi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perast\"&gt;Perast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kotor\"&gt;Kotor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Budva\"&gt;Budva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulcinj\"&gt;Ulcinj&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"National%20Geographic%20Traveler\"&gt;National Geographic Traveler&lt;/a&gt;\" (edited once a decade) ranks Montenegro among the \"50 Places of a Lifetime\", and the Montenegrin seaside &lt;a href=\"Sveti%20Stefan\"&gt;Sveti Stefan&lt;/a&gt; was used as the cover for the magazine. The coast region of Montenegro is considered one of the great new \"discoveries\" among world tourists. In January 2010, \"The New York Times\" ranked the Ulcinj South Coast region of Montenegro, including &lt;a href=\"Velika%20Pla%C5%BEa\"&gt;Velika Pla\u017ea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ada%20Bojana\"&gt;Ada Bojana&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hotel%20Mediteran\"&gt;Hotel Mediteran&lt;/a&gt; of Ulcinj, among the \"Top 31 Places to Go in 2010\" as part of a worldwide ranking of tourism destinations.\nMontenegro was also listed by Yahoo Travel among the \"10 Top Hot Spots of 2009\" to visit, describing it as being \"[c]urrently ranked as the second fastest growing tourism market in the world (falling just behind China)\". It is listed every year by prestigious tourism guides like Lonely Planet as a top tourist destination along with Greece, Spain and other popular locations.\nDemographics.\nEthnic structure.\nAccording to the 2003 census, Montenegro has 620,145 citizens. If the methodology used up to 1991 had been adopted in the 2003 census, Montenegro would officially have recorded 673,094 citizens. The results of the 2011 census show that Montenegro had 620,029 citizens.\nMontenegro is a &lt;a href=\"Multinational%20state\"&gt;multiethnic state&lt;/a&gt; in which no ethnic group forms a majority. Major ethnic groups include &lt;a href=\"Montenegrins%20%28ethnic%20group%29\"&gt;Montenegrins&lt;/a&gt; (\u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0438/\"Crnogorci\") and &lt;a href=\"Serbs\"&gt;Serbs&lt;/a&gt; (\u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438/\"Srbi\"); others are &lt;a href=\"Bosniaks\"&gt;Bosniaks&lt;/a&gt; (\"Bo\u0161njaci\"), &lt;a href=\"Albanians\"&gt;Albanians&lt;/a&gt; (\"Albanci\u00a0\u2013 Shqiptar\u00ebt\") and &lt;a href=\"Croats\"&gt;Croats&lt;/a&gt; (\"Hrvati\"). The number of \"Montenegrins\" and \"Serbs\" fluctuates widely from census to census due to changes in how people perceive, experience, or choose to express, their identity and ethnic affiliation.\nEthnic composition according to the 2011 official data:\nLanguages.\nThe official language in Montenegro is &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20language\"&gt;Montenegrin&lt;/a&gt;. Also, &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20language\"&gt;Serbian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosnian%20language\"&gt;Bosnian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20language\"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Croatian%20language\"&gt;Croatian&lt;/a&gt; are recognised in usage. Montenegrin, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian are &lt;a href=\"mutually%20intelligible\"&gt;mutually intelligible&lt;/a&gt;, all being &lt;a href=\"standard%20varieties\"&gt;standard varieties&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Serbo-Croatian%20language\"&gt;Serbo-Croatian language&lt;/a&gt;. Montenegrin is the plurality mother-tongue of the population under 18 years of age. Previous constitutions endorsed Serbo-Croatian as the official language in &lt;a href=\"SR%20Montenegro\"&gt;SR Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; and Serbian of the &lt;a href=\"Ijekavian\"&gt;Ijekavian&lt;/a&gt; standard during the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Montenegro%20%28federal%29\"&gt;1992\u20132006 period&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the 2011 Census the following languages are spoken in the country:\nReligion.\nMontenegro has been historically at the crossroads of multiculturalism and over centuries this has shaped its unique form of co-existence between Muslim and Christian populations. Montenegrins have been, historically, members of the &lt;a href=\"Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Serbian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; (governed by the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitanate%20of%20Montenegro%20and%20the%20Littoral\"&gt;Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral&lt;/a&gt;), and Serbian Orthodox Christianity is the most popular religion today in Montenegro. The &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Montenegrin Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; was recently founded and is followed by a small minority of Montenegrins although it is not in communion with any other Christian Orthodox Church as it has not been officially recognised.\nDespite tensions between religious groups during the &lt;a href=\"Bosnian%20War\"&gt;Bosnian War&lt;/a&gt;, Montenegro remained fairly stable, mainly due to its population having a historic perspective on religious tolerance and faith diversity. Religious institutions from Montenegro all have guaranteed rights and are separate from the state. The second largest religion is Islam, which amounts to 19% of the total population of the country. Montenegro has the sixth-highest proportion of Muslims in Europe, after Kosovo (96%), Turkey (90%), Albania (60%), Bosnia and Herzegovina (51%), and North Macedonia (34%), and Montenegro has the third highest proportion among Slavic countries, behind only Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia. A little more than one-fourth of the country's &lt;a href=\"Albanians\"&gt;Albanians&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Catholics\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt; (8,126 in the 2004 census) while the rest (22,267) are mainly &lt;a href=\"Sunni%20Muslims\"&gt;Sunni Muslims&lt;/a&gt;; in 2012 a protocol passed that recognises &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; as an official religion in Montenegro, ensures that &lt;a href=\"halal\"&gt;halal&lt;/a&gt; foods will be served at military facilities, hospitals, dormitories and all social facilities; and that Muslim women will be permitted to wear headscarves in schools and at public institutions, as well as ensuring that Muslims have the right to take Fridays off work for the &lt;a href=\"Jumu%27ah\"&gt;Jumu'ah&lt;/a&gt; (Friday)-prayer. Since the time of &lt;a href=\"Vojislavljevi%C4%87%20dynasty\"&gt;Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty&lt;/a&gt; Catholicism is autochthonous in the Montenegrin area. There is also a small Roman Catholic population, mostly Albanians with some Croats, divided between the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Bar\"&gt;Archdiocese of Antivari&lt;/a&gt; headed by the Primate of Serbia and the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Kotor\"&gt;Diocese of Kotor&lt;/a&gt; that is a part of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20Croatia\"&gt;Catholic Church in Croatia&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligious determination according to the 2011 census:\nCulture.\nArt.\nThe culture of Montenegro has been shaped by a variety of influences throughout history. The influence of Orthodox, Ottoman (Turk), Slavic, Central European, and seafaring Adriatic cultures (notably parts of Italy, like the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Venice\"&gt;Republic of Venice&lt;/a&gt;) have been the most important in recent centuries.\nMontenegro has many significant cultural and historical sites, including heritage sites from the pre-&lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20architecture\"&gt;Romanesque&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20art\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baroque\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; periods. The Montenegrin coastal region is especially well known for its religious monuments, including the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Saint%20Tryphon\"&gt;Cathedral of Saint Tryphon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kotor\"&gt;Kotor&lt;/a&gt; (Cattaro under the Venetians), the basilica of St. Luke (over 800 years), &lt;a href=\"Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Rocks\"&gt;Our Lady of the Rocks&lt;/a&gt; (\u0160krpjela), the &lt;a href=\"Savina%20monastery%20%28Montenegro%29\"&gt;Savina Monastery&lt;/a&gt; and others. Medieval monasteries contain a number of artistically important frescoes.\nA dimension of Montenegrin culture is the ethical ideal of \"\u010cojstvo i Juna\u0161tvo\", \"Humaneness and Gallantry\". The traditional folk dance of the Montenegrins is the &lt;a href=\"Oro%20%28eagle%20dance%29\"&gt;Oro&lt;/a&gt;, the \"eagle dance\" that involves dancing in circles with couples alternating in the centre, and is finished by forming a human pyramid by dancers standing on each other's shoulders.\nLiterature.\nMontenegro's capital, Podgorica, and the former royal capital of Cetinje are the two most important centres of culture and the arts in the country.\nThe American author &lt;a href=\"Rex%20Stout\"&gt;Rex Stout&lt;/a&gt; wrote a long series of detective novels featuring his fictional creation &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Wolfe\"&gt;Nero Wolfe&lt;/a&gt;, who was born in Montenegro. His Nero Wolfe novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Mountain%20%28novel%29\"&gt;The Black Mountain&lt;/a&gt;\" was largely set in Montenegro during the 1950s.\nMedia.\nThe media of Montenegro refers to mass media outlets based in Montenegro. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, &lt;a href=\"subscription\"&gt;subscription&lt;/a&gt;, and other sales-related revenues. The &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Constitution of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; guarantees freedom of speech.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"country%20in%20transition\"&gt;country in transition&lt;/a&gt;, Montenegro's media system is under transformation.\nCuisine.\nMontenegrin cuisine is a result of Montenegro's long history. It is a variation of Mediterranean and Asian influences. The most influence is from Italy, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; the cuisine in the coastal area differs from the one in the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20cuisine\"&gt;Mediterranean cuisine&lt;/a&gt;, with seafood being a common dish, while the northern represents more Asian influence.\nSport.\nSport in Montenegro revolves mostly around &lt;a href=\"team%20sport\"&gt;team sport&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"water%20polo\"&gt;water polo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"handball\"&gt;handball&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"volleyball\"&gt;volleyball&lt;/a&gt;. Other sports involved are &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tennis\"&gt;tennis&lt;/a&gt;, swimming, &lt;a href=\"judo\"&gt;judo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"karate\"&gt;karate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"table%20tennis\"&gt;table tennis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Water%20polo\"&gt;Water polo&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular sport in Montenegro, and is considered the &lt;a href=\"national%20sport\"&gt;national sport&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Montenegro%20men%27s%20national%20water%20polo%20team\"&gt;Montenegro men's national water polo team&lt;/a&gt; is one of the &lt;a href=\"FINA%20Water%20Polo%20World%20Rankings\"&gt;top ranked&lt;/a&gt; teams in the world, winning the gold medal at the &lt;a href=\"2008%20Men%27s%20European%20Water%20Polo%20Championship\"&gt;2008 Men's European Water Polo Championship&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A1laga\"&gt;M\u00e1laga&lt;/a&gt;, Spain, and winning the gold medal at the &lt;a href=\"2009%20FINA%20Men%27s%20Water%20Polo%20World%20League\"&gt;2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League&lt;/a&gt;, which was held in the Montenegrin capital, &lt;a href=\"Podgorica\"&gt;Podgorica&lt;/a&gt;. The Montenegrin team &lt;a href=\"PVK%20Primorac\"&gt;PVK Primorac&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kotor\"&gt;Kotor&lt;/a&gt; became a champion of Europe at the &lt;a href=\"LEN%20Euroleague\"&gt;LEN Euroleague&lt;/a&gt; 2009 in &lt;a href=\"Rijeka\"&gt;Rijeka&lt;/a&gt;, Croatia. &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;Football&lt;/a&gt; is the second most popular sport in Montenegro. Notable football players from Montenegro are &lt;a href=\"Dejan%20Savi%C4%87evi%C4%87\"&gt;Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Predrag%20Mijatovi%C4%87\"&gt;Predrag Mijatovi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirko%20Vu%C4%8Dini%C4%87\"&gt;Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Savi%C4%87\"&gt;Stefan Savi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stevan%20Joveti%C4%87\"&gt;Stevan Joveti\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Mugo%C5%A1a\"&gt;Stefan Mugo\u0161a&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Montenegrin national football team&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 2006, played in playoffs for &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202012\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2012&lt;/a&gt;, which is the biggest success in the history of the national team. The &lt;a href=\"Montenegro%20national%20basketball%20team\"&gt;Montenegro national basketball team&lt;/a&gt; is also known for good performances and had won a lot of medals in the past as part of the &lt;a href=\"Yugoslavia%20national%20basketball%20team\"&gt;Yugoslavia national basketball team&lt;/a&gt;. In 2006, the &lt;a href=\"Basketball%20Federation%20of%20Montenegro\"&gt;Basketball Federation of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; along with this team joined the &lt;a href=\"International%20Basketball%20Federation\"&gt;International Basketball Federation&lt;/a&gt; (FIBA) on its own, following the &lt;a href=\"Montenegrin%20independence%20referendum%2C%202006\"&gt;Independence of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;. Montenegro participated on two Eurobaskets until now.\nAmong women sports, &lt;a href=\"Montenegro%20women%27s%20national%20handball%20team\"&gt;the national handball team&lt;/a&gt; is the most successful, having won the &lt;a href=\"2012%20European%20Women%27s%20Handball%20Championship\"&gt;2012 European Championship&lt;/a&gt; and finishing as runners-up at the &lt;a href=\"Handball%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2012 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"%C5%BDRK%20Budu%C4%87nost%20Podgorica\"&gt;\u017dRK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica&lt;/a&gt; won two times EHF Champions League.\n&lt;a href=\"Chess\"&gt;Chess&lt;/a&gt; is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like &lt;a href=\"Slavko%20Dedi%C4%87\"&gt;Slavko Dedi\u0107&lt;/a&gt;, were born in Montenegro.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Handball%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2012 Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; in London, &lt;a href=\"Montenegro%20women%27s%20national%20handball%20team\"&gt;Montenegro women's national handball team&lt;/a&gt; won the country's first Olympic medal by winning silver.
