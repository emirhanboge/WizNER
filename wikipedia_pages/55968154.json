Josef's story begins when Josef's father Aaron gets taken away on &lt;a href=\"Kristallnacht\"&gt;Kristallnacht&lt;/a&gt; and is sent to the &lt;a href=\"Dachau%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;Dachau concentration camp&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sturmabteilung\"&gt;Nazi Stormtroopers&lt;/a&gt;. When his father is released six months later, Josef, his mother Rachel his sister Ruthie, and his father, now &lt;a href=\"Post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder\"&gt;traumatized&lt;/a&gt; by his experiences at Dachau, all board the &lt;a href=\"MS%20St.%20Louis\"&gt;MS St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, which is set to take them to Cuba. A week into their stay on the St. Louis, Josef has his &lt;a href=\"Bar%20and%20bat%20mitzvah\"&gt;bar mitzvah&lt;/a&gt;. In becoming an adult, he has many responsibilities that he is forced to take. With his father\u2019s mental health deteriorating quicker, Josef threatens him to ensure that he can pass the medical inspection to get into Cuba, reversing their roles as father and son. While the passengers wait to be allowed to disembark, Josef encounters Isabel's grandfather, Mariano Padron, who is a Cuban &lt;a href=\"government%20officer\"&gt;government officer&lt;/a&gt; bound by duty not to let the Jewish refugees in, despite feeling sorry for them. Josef\u2019s maturation continues as they situation worsens: after his father &lt;a href=\"Suicide%20attempt\"&gt;attempts suicide&lt;/a&gt; and is separated from the family, his mother is stricken with grief, so Josef makes sure that Ruthie is being cared for and protected. When the Jewish refugees are rejected from entering Cuba and it seems likely that the ship is going to take them back to Germany, Josef works with other passengers to try to take the ship hostage so that they can avoid this fate. They fail, but they are not sent back to Germany. Instead, they are sent to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, where they stay. However, when Germany starts &lt;a href=\"German%20military%20administration%20in%20occupied%20France%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;occupying France&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the novel, the Nazis give his mother the choice of setting only one of her children free. Josef sacrifices himself in order to relieve his mother from the burden of this choice and to spare Ruthie from the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20concentration%20camps\"&gt;concentration camps&lt;/a&gt;. Josef later dies in the camps, along with his mother. It is later learned that Josef's father is alive and well in Cuba.\nIsabel.\nIsabel is 11 years old in 1994, growing up in &lt;a href=\"Havana\"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;, Cuba, under &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Castro\"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; regime. Isabel is deeply tied to her &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20Cuba\"&gt;Cuban heritage&lt;/a&gt;, particularly through her &lt;a href=\"Clave%20%28rhythm%29\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;. One issue she experiences, however, is that she is unable to count a Cuban rhythm called &lt;a href=\"Clave%20%28rhythm%29\"&gt;\"clave\"&lt;/a&gt;, which she thinks is supposed to come naturally to Cubans. Isabel takes on a great of responsibility for her family due to the upheaval in which she lives. When her father, Geraldo, is worried that the &lt;a href=\"Law%20enforcement%20in%20Cuba\"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; are coming after him for &lt;a href=\"Maleconazo\"&gt;protesting&lt;/a&gt;, Isabel rallies her own family and another family, the Castillos, to &lt;a href=\"1994%20Cuban%20rafter%20crisis\"&gt;take a boat&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Miami\"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; and escape the oppression of Cuba. She trades her &lt;a href=\"trumpet\"&gt;trumpet&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"gasoline\"&gt;gasoline&lt;/a&gt; in order to get the boat to run. Among the people who join Isabel on the journey is her grandfather Lito, who is eventually revealed to be Mariano Padron, the Cuban officer who, decades ago, prevented Josef from entering Havana. Isabel spends much of the dangerous trip acting as an adult: she takes care of her eight-and-a-half-months &lt;a href=\"Pregnancy\"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; mother, Teresa; she saves Se\u00f1or Castillo when he is thrown overboard by waves; and she spends much of the trip relentlessly bailing out water from their boat so that they can continue their journey. Isabel also deals with a fair share of trauma that expedites this maturity: two years prior, her grandmother Lita drowned during a &lt;a href=\"1993%20Storm%20of%20the%20Century\"&gt;cyclone&lt;/a&gt; in Havana, and on this boat trip Isabel\u2019s best friend, Iv\u00e1n, is &lt;a href=\"Shark%20attack\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; in the water by sharks. Despite her grief, Isabel is able to persevere and guide her family to reach the shores of Miami. At the end of the book, Isabel is able to reconnect with her heritage when her uncle Guillermo gives her a new trumpet, and Isabel is able to count \"clave\".\nMahmoud.\nMahmoud is 13 years old in 2015, and lives in &lt;a href=\"Aleppo\"&gt;Aleppo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; with his father Youssef, his mother Fatima, his 10-year-old brother Waleed, and his &lt;a href=\"infant\"&gt;infant&lt;/a&gt; sister Hana. Mahmoud has already had much experience dealing with the trauma of war, as the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20civil%20war\"&gt;Syrian Civil War&lt;/a&gt; has already been raging for four years at the beginning of Mahmoud\u2019s story. Mahmoud learns to cope with these conditions by assuming a protective role over Waleed, and by learning to be \u201cinvisible,\u201d keeping his head down and ensuring nobody notices him to survive. Mahmoud grapples with this question of whether it is better to be invisible or visible over the course of the novel as his family travels from Syria to &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. He understands that being unnoticed helps him avoid trouble, but he also begins to see the problems with remaining invisible, because it prevents good people from taking notice of them and providing aid. Mahmoud finally sees the power of visibility when he decides to walk out of the &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Right%20of%20asylum\"&gt;detention center&lt;/a&gt; and lead the other refugees on a 12-hour march to &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;. This gains a large amount of &lt;a href=\"Publicity\"&gt;media attention&lt;/a&gt;, and Austrians greet them at the border with &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"medicine\"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Mahmoud recognizes the importance of being visible, and his story also raises visibility for the many Syrian refugees who continue to need aid in the present. Like Josef, Mahmoud is also forced to make a difficult choice that shows his maturity and the weight of his responsibility. As Mahmoud and his family travel from Syria to &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, they become stranded in the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean sea&lt;/a&gt; when their boat &lt;a href=\"Capsizing\"&gt;capsizes&lt;/a&gt; in the water. When another &lt;a href=\"dinghy\"&gt;dinghy&lt;/a&gt; passes by that doesn\u2019t have space for his family, he offers up Hana to them in order to ensure that she can survive. This is a decision that no 13-year-old should have to make, but Mahmoud\u2019s difficult journey requires him to take on this burden. Eventually, Mahmoud and his family make it safely to Germany and are taken in by a host family, the elderly Saul Rosenberg and his wife, Ruthie\u2014Josef\u2019s little sister, who survived the &lt;a href=\"The%20Holocaust\"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; decades prior thanks to Josef\u2019s self-sacrifice. However, Hana is lost and nowhere to be found, presumably lost or dead."
