    "text": "H\u00f6fn () or H\u00f6fn \u00ed Hornafir\u00f0i () is an &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;ic fishing town in the southeastern part of the country. It lies near &lt;a href=\"Hornafj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur\"&gt;Hornafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur&lt;/a&gt; fjord.\nThe town, the second largest in the southeastern part of Iceland, offers scenic views of &lt;a href=\"Vatnaj%C3%B6kull\"&gt;Vatnaj\u00f6kull&lt;/a&gt; (the largest &lt;a href=\"ice%20cap\"&gt;ice cap&lt;/a&gt; in Europe by volume). The community was formerly known as Hornafjar\u00f0arb\u00e6r between 1994 and 1998.\nGeography.\nH\u00f6fn is located on a peninsula in the southeast of Iceland. The name H\u00f6fn means harbour and it is a fishing port surrounded on three sides by the sea, with beaches on a long shoreline to the southeast. &lt;a href=\"Shoal\"&gt;Shoal&lt;/a&gt;s and glacial rivers traverse this area with many shifting &lt;a href=\"lagoon\"&gt;lagoon&lt;/a&gt;s and sand reefs being formed. H\u00f6fn is surrounded by several small islands to the east of the town, the largest of which is &lt;a href=\"Mikley\"&gt;Mikley&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Kr%C3%B3kal%C3%A1tur\"&gt;Kr\u00f3kal\u00e1tur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hellir%20%28Island%29\"&gt;Hellir&lt;/a&gt;.\nH\u00f6fn is one of very few harbours in the southern part of Iceland and it needs to be navigated with care due to the changing pattern of shoals. &lt;a href=\"Dredging\"&gt;Dredging&lt;/a&gt; is an essential requirement to remove sand that has accumulated near the harbour so that ships can safely moor. The entrance channel to H\u00f6fn port has a minimum depth of . However, the depth at the entrance itself is . The harbour at H\u00f6fn is reported to freeze during periods of extremely cold weather.\n&lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Air%20%28Iceland%29\"&gt;Eagle Airways&lt;/a&gt; operates domestic flights from &lt;a href=\"Hornafj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur%20Airport\"&gt;H\u00f6fn airport&lt;/a&gt; and the town is a major centre for visitors to the Vatnaj\u00f6kull Glacier. H\u00f6fn lies at the end of Road 99, which leaves Iceland's &lt;a href=\"Route%201%20%28Iceland%29\"&gt;National Road 1&lt;/a&gt; several kilometres north of the town. A tunnel is located near the town, measuring 1,300 metres in length, which is named &lt;a href=\"Almannaskar%C3%B0sg%C3%B6ng\"&gt;Almannaskar\u00f0sg\u00f6ng&lt;/a&gt;. It was opened in 2005.\nNearby areas include Su\u00f0ursveit (the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"%C3%9E%C3%B3rbergur%20%C3%9E%C3%B3r%C3%B0arson\"&gt;\u00de\u00f3rbergur \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"%C3%96r%C3%A6fasveit\"&gt;\u00d6r\u00e6fasveit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L%C3%B3n\"&gt;L\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BDrar\"&gt;M\u00fdrar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nes%20%28Iceland%29\"&gt;Nes&lt;/a&gt;. In Nes there is a small village called Nesjahverfi. &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Iceland, is about from H\u00f6fn along the south coast.\nEconomy.\nThe main economic activities in H\u00f6fn are fishing and tourism. Fishing involves both sea fishing and processing and packaging in the factories; one major fish processing factory, Skinney-\u00deinganes is one of the largest fish factories in the eastern part of Iceland, which employs a large number of people. The main production of these factories is bacaloa (saltfish) and processed lobster. Herring and &lt;a href=\"capelin\"&gt;capelin&lt;/a&gt; are also processed. Ten large and a number of smaller boats operate from H\u00f6fn. During the summer tourist season, trips are organised to the nearby Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier. The surrounding area has served as a &lt;a href=\"filming%20location\"&gt;filming location&lt;/a&gt; for feature films including the &lt;a href=\"James%20Bond\"&gt;James Bond&lt;/a&gt; movies \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Another%20Day\"&gt;Die Another Day&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"A%20View%20to%20a%20Kill\"&gt;A View to a Kill&lt;/a&gt;\", \"\", and &lt;a href=\"Batman%20Begins\"&gt;Batman Begins&lt;/a&gt;. Recently a song in the 2015 Bollywood movie \"&lt;a href=\"Dilwale%20%282015%20film%29\"&gt;Dilwale&lt;/a&gt;\" has been shot in the surrounding areas.\nH\u00f6fn offers a variety of services and stores including a supermarket, pharmacy, a bank, three hairdressers, two gas stations and a swimming pool.\nIn the town there are several guesthouses and restaurants. Restaurants including Pakkh\u00fasi\u00f0, Humarh\u00f6fnin, \u00cdsh\u00fasi\u00f0 Pizzeria, Ott\u00f3, Kaffihorni\u00f0, \u00d3sinn, Z Bistro and Hafnarb\u00fa\u00f0in.\nThe headland of the town is called the &lt;a href=\"Ing%C3%B3lfsh%C3%B6f%C3%B0i\"&gt;Ing\u00f3lfsh\u00f6f\u00f0i&lt;/a&gt;, which is high and (in a direct line) from the town. Sea birds such as &lt;a href=\"skua\"&gt;skua&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"guillemots\"&gt;guillemots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fulmar\"&gt;fulmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"puffin\"&gt;puffin&lt;/a&gt;s can be seen from the headland.\nCulture.\nA cultural highlight of the town is the annual Humarh\u00e1t\u00ed\u00f0 (a &lt;a href=\"lobster\"&gt;lobster&lt;/a&gt; festival) held on the first weekend of July. During the summer season, the Glacier Exhibition is held in the old supermarket building.\nH\u00f6fn contains several museums, including an exhibition about the Vatnaj\u00f6kuls\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0gar\u00f0 in Gamlab\u00fa\u00f0 which has a variety of displays on the geology, ecology and history of the glacier.\nGamlab\u00fa\u00f0.\nGamlab\u00fa\u00f0 (\"Old Shop\") is one of the oldest houses in H\u00f6fn still being used. It has served at least three purposes and has been moved around southeast Iceland. First it was a trade center in Pap\u00f3s and then it was a store in H\u00f6fn. Most recently it has been moved again and now it serves as an information center.\nOriginally called \"Kramb\u00fa\u00f0in\", meaning \"The Mercantile Store\", in a short time it had managed to become one of the main trade centers for the people of southeast Iceland, as there were few other settlements in the area. Just about everything available in these parts of Iceland was sold here. Farmers were the main group of people making purchases, so naturally it sold mostly tools and such things that farmers needed on daily basis. In 1897 it was moved to the harbor of H\u00f6fn and stayed there for 80 years.\nThe house was the main trade post for the citizens of H\u00f6fn from 1937-1977, but when the town began to develop and modernize, the shop had neither a place at the harbor or in the town so it changed and moved, this time to S\u00edlav\u00edk on the outskirts of town.\nThe municipality decided to move it again in 2012, back to the harbour of H\u00f6fn. This was done with the blessing of The Cultural Heritage Agency of Iceland which oversees the conservation of historical buildings. It now serves as an information and visitor centre for &lt;a href=\"Vatnaj%C3%B6kull%20National%20Park\"&gt;Vatnaj\u00f6kull National Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\nH\u00f6fn used to have three schools: &lt;a href=\"Nesjask%C3%B3li\"&gt;Nesjask\u00f3li&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Nesjahverfi\"&gt;Nesjahverfi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hafnarsk%C3%B3li\"&gt;Hafnarsk\u00f3li&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heppusk%C3%B3li\"&gt;Heppusk\u00f3li&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the three schools have been merged into one school called Grunnsk\u00f3li Hornafjar\u00f0ar. In the secondary school &lt;a href=\"Framhaldssk%C3%B3linn%20%C3%AD%20Austur-Skaftafellss%C3%BDslu\"&gt;Framhaldssk\u00f3linn \u00ed Austur-Skaftafellss\u00fdslu&lt;/a&gt; 70 to 100 students study in the day school and over 100 students are under distance-study programmes. The school maintains close collaboration with other schools in Iceland, the College in &lt;a href=\"Egilssta%C3%B0ir\"&gt;Egilssta\u00f0ir&lt;/a&gt; and the Vocational School in &lt;a href=\"Neskaupsta%C3%B0ur\"&gt;Neskaupsta\u00f0ur&lt;/a&gt;. The school has modern teaching facilities such as wireless internet, a computer centre, availability of laptop computers for students, overhead projectors and built-in sound systems.\nSports.\nThe local football club is &lt;a href=\"UMF%20Sindri%20H%C3%B6fn\"&gt;Sindri&lt;/a&gt;, which plays in the Icelandic 3rd tier.\nClimate.\nH\u00f6fn has a &lt;a href=\"subpolar%20oceanic%20climate\"&gt;subpolar oceanic climate&lt;/a&gt; (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfc\"), bordering on a &lt;a href=\"subarctic%20climate\"&gt;subarctic climate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tundra%20climate\"&gt;tundra climate&lt;/a&gt;. Daytime highs in the summer are around , while being just above the freezing point in the winter. H\u00f6fn is a rainy town, averaging approximately of precipitation. On average, H\u00f6fn has 180 days with measurable precipitation. Extreme temperatures range from recorded on August 10, 2004 to recorded on March 8, 1969.\nTransport.\nH\u00f6fn is well connected via &lt;a href=\"Route%201%20%28Iceland%29\"&gt;Route 1&lt;/a&gt;, which circles Iceland. The distance to Reykjavik is . In the past, during the harsh winter months, the road just east of H\u00f6fn would often become blocked because of regular snow, hampering communications and access. To address this, a new tunnel, named &lt;a href=\"Almannaskar%C3%B0sg%C3%B6ng\"&gt;Almannaskar\u00f0sg\u00f6ng&lt;/a&gt;, was constructed and opened in 2005. The tunnel measures exactly in length (although the sign rounds it off to 1,300).\nBy air, &lt;a href=\"Hornafj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur%20Airport\"&gt;Hornafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur Airport&lt;/a&gt; provides service to Reykjavik."
