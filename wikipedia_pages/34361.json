    "text": "York is a &lt;a href=\"cathedral%20city\"&gt;cathedral city&lt;/a&gt; with Roman origins at the confluence of the rivers &lt;a href=\"River%20Ouse%2C%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Ouse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Foss\"&gt;Foss&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;North Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, England. It is the historic county town of &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;. The city has long-standing buildings and structures, such as &lt;a href=\"York%20Minster\"&gt;York Minster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"York%20Castle\"&gt;York Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"York%20city%20walls\"&gt;York city walls&lt;/a&gt;. It was a &lt;a href=\"county%20corporate\"&gt;county corporate&lt;/a&gt;, outside of the county's council and the &lt;a href=\"riding%20%28division%29\"&gt;ridings&lt;/a&gt;. The City of York &lt;a href=\"unitary%20authority\"&gt;unitary authority area&lt;/a&gt; includes the city, the town of &lt;a href=\"Haxby\"&gt;Haxby&lt;/a&gt;, and surrounding villages and rural areas. The &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20York%20Council\"&gt;City of York Council&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for providing all local services and facilities throughout the district. \nThe city was founded by the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Romans&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Eboracum\"&gt;Eboracum&lt;/a&gt; in 71\u00a0AD. It became the capital of the Roman province of &lt;a href=\"Britannia%20Inferior\"&gt;Britannia Inferior&lt;/a&gt;, and later of the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Deira\"&gt;Deira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northumbria\"&gt;Northumbria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3rv%C3%ADk\"&gt;J\u00f3rv\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt;, York grew as a major wool-trading centre and became the capital of the northern &lt;a href=\"ecclesiastical%20province\"&gt;ecclesiastical province&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt;, a role it has retained. In the 19th century, York became a major hub of the railway network and a confectionery manufacturing centre, a status it maintained well into the 20th century. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, York was bombed as part of the &lt;a href=\"Baedeker%20Blitz\"&gt;Baedeker Blitz&lt;/a&gt;; although less affected by bombing than other northern cities, several historic buildings were gutted and restoration efforts continued into the 1960s.\nThe city had a population of 153,717 in the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Census%20for%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;2011 census&lt;/a&gt; and is in the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20and%20the%20Humber\"&gt;Yorkshire and the Humber&lt;/a&gt; region. The wider City of York had a population of , the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20English%20districts%20by%20population\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; most populous district in England.\nHistory.\nOrigin of the name.\nThe word \"York\" () is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Common%20Brittonic\"&gt;Brittonic&lt;/a&gt; name (&lt;a href=\"Latin%20%28language%29\"&gt;Latinised&lt;/a&gt; as or ), a combination of \"&lt;a href=\"Taxus%20baccata\"&gt;yew tree&lt;/a&gt;\" (compare &lt;a href=\"Old%20Irish\"&gt;Old Irish&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Irish%20language\"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; , , and , and &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Gaelic\"&gt;Scottish Gaelic&lt;/a&gt; ; compare also &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breton%20language\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; , both meaning \"alder buckthorn\") and a suffix of &lt;a href=\"appurtenance\"&gt;appurtenance&lt;/a&gt; , meaning \"belonging to,\u201d or \u201cplace of\" (compare Welsh ). Put together, these old words meant \"place of the yew trees\". (In &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt;, ; in Old Irish, ; in Irish Gaelic, ; and in Scottish Gaelic, ). The city is called in Irish and in Scottish Gaelic\u2014names derived from the Latin word . A proposed alternate meaning is \"the settlement of (a man named) ,\" a &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20languages\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; personal name spelled variously in different documents as , and : when combined with the Celtic possessive suffix , the word could be used to denote the property of a man with this name.\nThe name became the &lt;a href=\"Angles\"&gt;Anglian&lt;/a&gt; in the 7th\u00a0century: a compound of , from the old name, and , meaning \u201cvillage,\u201d probably by conflation of the element with a &lt;a href=\"Germanic%20languages\"&gt;Germanic&lt;/a&gt; root ('boar'); by the 7th\u00a0century, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; for 'boar' had become . When the &lt;a href=\"Danes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; army conquered the city in 866, it was renamed .\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20French\"&gt;Old French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Norman%20language\"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt; name of the city following the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20conquest%20of%20England\"&gt;Norman Conquest&lt;/a&gt; was recorded as (modern Norman ) in works such as Wace's \"&lt;a href=\"Roman%20de%20Rou\"&gt;Roman de Rou&lt;/a&gt;\". , meanwhile, gradually reduced to \"York\" in the centuries after the Conquest, moving from the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20English\"&gt;Middle English&lt;/a&gt; in the 14th\u00a0century through in the 16th\u00a0century to \"Yarke\" in the 17th\u00a0century. The form \"York\" was first recorded in the 13th\u00a0century. Many company and place names, such as the Ebor race meeting, refer to the Latinised Brittonic, Roman name.\nThe 12th\u2011century chronicler &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth\"&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth&lt;/a&gt;, in his fictional account of the prehistoric kings of Britain, , suggests the name derives from that of a pre-Roman city founded by the legendary king &lt;a href=\"Ebraucus\"&gt;Ebraucus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20of%20York\"&gt;Archbishop of York&lt;/a&gt; uses \"Ebor\" as his surname in his signature.\nEarly history.\nArchaeological evidence suggests that &lt;a href=\"Mesolithic\"&gt;Mesolithic&lt;/a&gt; people settled in the region of York between 8000 and 7000\u00a0BC, although it is not known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Roman conquest of Britain&lt;/a&gt;, the area was occupied by a &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; known to the Romans as the &lt;a href=\"Brigantes\"&gt;Brigantes&lt;/a&gt;. The Brigantian tribal area initially became a Roman client state, but later its leaders became more hostile and the Roman &lt;a href=\"Legio%20IX%20Hispana\"&gt;Ninth Legion&lt;/a&gt; was sent north of the &lt;a href=\"Humber\"&gt;Humber&lt;/a&gt; into Brigantian territory.\nThe city was founded in 71\u00a0AD, when the Ninth Legion conquered the Brigantes and constructed a wooden military &lt;a href=\"castra\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; on flat ground above the &lt;a href=\"River%20Ouse%2C%20Yorkshire\"&gt;River Ouse&lt;/a&gt; close to its &lt;a href=\"confluence\"&gt;confluence&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"River%20Foss\"&gt;River Foss&lt;/a&gt;. The fortress, whose walls were rebuilt in stone by the VI legion based there subsequent to the IX legion, covered an area of and was inhabited by 6,000 &lt;a href=\"Roman%20legion\"&gt;legion&lt;/a&gt;ary soldiers. The site of the \"principia\" (HQ) of the fortress lies under the foundations of &lt;a href=\"York%20Minster\"&gt;York Minster&lt;/a&gt;, and excavations in the undercroft have revealed part of the Roman structure and columns.\nThe Emperors &lt;a href=\"Hadrian\"&gt;Hadrian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Septimius%20Severus\"&gt;Septimius Severus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Constantius%20I\"&gt;Constantius I&lt;/a&gt; all held court in York during their various campaigns. During his stay 207\u2013211\u00a0AD, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York capital of the province of Britannia Inferior, and it is likely that it was he who granted York the privileges of a '&lt;a href=\"Colonia%20%28Roman%29\"&gt;colonia&lt;/a&gt;' or city. Constantius I died in 306\u00a0AD during his stay in York, and his son &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Constantine the Great&lt;/a&gt; was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress. In 314\u00a0AD a bishop from York attended the &lt;a href=\"Synod%20of%20Arles%20%28314%29\"&gt;Council at Arles&lt;/a&gt; to represent Christians from the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Roman \"colonia\" and &lt;a href=\"castra\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; were on high ground, by 400\u00a0AD the town was victim to occasional flooding from the Rivers Ouse and Foss, and the population reduced. York declined in the &lt;a href=\"sub-Roman%20Britain\"&gt;post-Roman&lt;/a&gt; era, and was taken and settled by the &lt;a href=\"Angles\"&gt;Angles&lt;/a&gt; in the 5th\u00a0century.\nReclamation of parts of the town was initiated in the 7th\u00a0century under &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20of%20Northumbria\"&gt;King Edwin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northumbria\"&gt;Northumbria&lt;/a&gt;, and York became his chief city. The first wooden &lt;a href=\"minster%20%28church%29\"&gt;minster church&lt;/a&gt; was built in York for the baptism of Edwin in 627, according to the Venerable Bede. Edwin ordered the small wooden church be rebuilt in stone; however, he was killed in 633, and the task of completing the stone minster fell to his successor &lt;a href=\"Oswald%20of%20Northumbria\"&gt;Oswald&lt;/a&gt;. In the following century, &lt;a href=\"Alcuin%20of%20York\"&gt;Alcuin of York&lt;/a&gt; came to the cathedral school of York. He had a long career as a teacher and scholar, first at the school at York now known as &lt;a href=\"St%20Peter%27s%20School%2C%20York\"&gt;St Peter's School&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 627\u00a0AD, and later as &lt;a href=\"Charlemagne\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/a&gt;'s leading advisor on ecclesiastical and educational affairs.\nIn 866, Northumbria was in the midst of internecine struggles when the &lt;a href=\"Vikings\"&gt;Vikings&lt;/a&gt; raided and captured York. As a thriving Anglo-Saxon metropolis and prosperous economic hub, York was a clear target for the Vikings. Led by &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20the%20Boneless\"&gt;Ivar the Boneless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halfdan%20Ragnarsson\"&gt;Halfdan&lt;/a&gt;, Scandinavian forces attacked the town on All Saints' Day. Launching the assault on a holy day proved an effective tactical move \u2013 most of York's leaders were in the cathedral, leaving the town vulnerable to attack and unprepared for battle.\nAfter it was conquered, the city was renamed from the Saxon Eoforwic to &lt;a href=\"Jorvik\"&gt;Jorvik&lt;/a&gt;. It became the capital of Viking territory in Britain, and at its peak boasted more than 10,000 inhabitants. This was a population second only to London within Great Britain. Jorvik proved an important economic and trade centre for the Vikings. Norse coinage was created at the Jorvik mint, while archaeologists have found evidence of a variety of craft workshops around the town's central &lt;a href=\"Coppergate\"&gt;Coppergate&lt;/a&gt; area. These demonstrate that textile production, metalwork, carving, glasswork and jewellery-making were all practised in Jorvik. Materials from as far afield as the &lt;a href=\"Persian%20Gulf\"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt; have also been discovered, suggesting that the town was part of an international trading network. Under Viking rule the city became a major river port, part of the extensive Viking trading routes throughout northern Europe. \nThe last ruler of an independent J\u00f3rv\u00edk, &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Bloodaxe\"&gt;Eric Bloodaxe&lt;/a&gt;, was driven from the city in 954\u00a0AD by King &lt;a href=\"Eadred\"&gt;Eadred&lt;/a&gt; in his successful attempt to complete the unification of England.\nAfter the conquest.\nIn 1068, two years after the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20conquest%20of%20England\"&gt;Norman conquest of England&lt;/a&gt;, the people of York rebelled. Initially they succeeded, but upon the arrival of &lt;a href=\"William%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;William the Conqueror&lt;/a&gt; the rebellion was put down. William at once built a wooden fortress on a motte. In 1069, after another rebellion, the king built another timbered castle across the River Ouse. These were destroyed in 1069 and rebuilt by William about the time of his ravaging Northumbria in what is called the \"&lt;a href=\"Harrying%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Harrying of the North&lt;/a&gt;\" where he destroyed everything from York to Durham. The remains of the rebuilt castles, now in stone, are visible on either side of the River Ouse.\nThe first stone minster church was badly damaged by fire in the uprising, and the Normans built a minster on a new site. Around the year 1080, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20I%20of%20York\"&gt;Archbishop Thomas&lt;/a&gt; started building the cathedral that in time became the current Minster.\nIn the 12th\u00a0century York started to prosper. In 1190, &lt;a href=\"York%20Castle%2312th%20century\"&gt;York Castle&lt;/a&gt; was the site of an infamous &lt;a href=\"12th%20century%20English%20pogroms\"&gt;massacre of its Jewish inhabitants&lt;/a&gt;, in which at least 150 were murdered, although some authorities put the figure as high as 500.\nThe city, through its location on the River Ouse and its proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20North%20Road%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;Great North Road&lt;/a&gt;, became a major trading centre. &lt;a href=\"John%2C%20King%20of%20England\"&gt;King John&lt;/a&gt; granted the city's first &lt;a href=\"charter\"&gt;charter&lt;/a&gt; in 1212, confirming trading rights in England and Europe. During the later Middle Ages, York merchants imported wine from France, cloth, wax, canvas, and oats from the &lt;a href=\"Low%20Countries\"&gt;Low Countries&lt;/a&gt;, timber and furs from the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20region\"&gt;Baltic&lt;/a&gt; and exported grain to &lt;a href=\"Gascony\"&gt;Gascony&lt;/a&gt; and grain and wool to the Low Countries.\nYork became a major cloth manufacturing and trading centre. &lt;a href=\"Edward%20I\"&gt;Edward I&lt;/a&gt; further stimulated the city's economy by using the city as a base for his war in Scotland. The city was the location of significant unrest during the so-called &lt;a href=\"Peasants%27%20Revolt\"&gt;Peasants' Revolt&lt;/a&gt; in 1381. The city acquired an increasing degree of autonomy from central government including the privileges granted by a charter of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Richard II&lt;/a&gt; in 1396.\n16th to 18th centuries.\nThe city underwent a period of economic decline during &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20period\"&gt;Tudor&lt;/a&gt; times. Under &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;King Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries\"&gt;Dissolution of the Monasteries&lt;/a&gt; saw the end of York's many &lt;a href=\"Monastery\"&gt;monastic houses&lt;/a&gt;, including several orders of &lt;a href=\"friars\"&gt;friars&lt;/a&gt;, the hospitals of St Nicholas and of St Leonard, the largest such institution in the north of England. This led to the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrimage%20of%20Grace\"&gt;Pilgrimage of Grace&lt;/a&gt;, an uprising of northern Catholics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire opposed to religious reform. Henry VIII restored his authority by establishing the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Council of the North&lt;/a&gt; in York in the dissolved St Mary's Abbey. The city became a trading and service centre during this period.\n&lt;a href=\"Anne%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Anne of Denmark&lt;/a&gt; came to York with her children &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Prince Henry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20Stuart%2C%20Queen%20of%20Bohemia\"&gt;Princess Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; on 11 June 1603. The Mayor gave her a tour and offered her &lt;a href=\"hippocras\"&gt;spiced wine&lt;/a&gt;, but she preferred beer. &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Fawkes\"&gt;Guy Fawkes&lt;/a&gt;, who was born and educated in York, was a member of a group of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; restorationists that planned the &lt;a href=\"Gunpowder%20Plot\"&gt;Gunpowder Plot&lt;/a&gt;. Its aim was to displace &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; rule by blowing up the &lt;a href=\"Houses%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;Houses of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; while King &lt;a href=\"James%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;James I&lt;/a&gt;, the entire Protestant, and even most of the Catholic &lt;a href=\"aristocracy\"&gt;aristocracy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nobility\"&gt;nobility&lt;/a&gt; were inside.\nIn 1644, during the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Roundhead\"&gt;Parliamentarians&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20York\"&gt;besieged York&lt;/a&gt;, and many medieval houses outside the city walls were lost. The &lt;a href=\"barbican\"&gt;barbican&lt;/a&gt; at Walmgate Bar was undermined and explosives laid, but the plot was discovered. On the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Rupert%20of%20the%20Rhine\"&gt;Prince Rupert&lt;/a&gt;, with an army of 15,000\u00a0men, the siege was lifted. The Parliamentarians retreated some from York with Rupert in pursuit, before turning on his army and soundly defeating it at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Marston%20Moor\"&gt;Battle of Marston Moor&lt;/a&gt;. Of Rupert's 15,000\u00a0troops, 4,000 were killed and 1,500 captured. The siege was renewed and the city surrendered to &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Fairfax%2C%203rd%20Lord%20Fairfax%20of%20Cameron\"&gt;Sir Thomas Fairfax&lt;/a&gt; on 15 July.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"English%20Restoration\"&gt;restoration of the monarchy&lt;/a&gt; in 1660, and the removal of the garrison from York in 1688, the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants, although the clergy were still important. Competition from &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20upon%20Hull\"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt;, together with silting of the River Ouse, resulted in York losing its pre-eminent position as a trading centre, but its role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was rising. York's many elegant &lt;a href=\"townhouse\"&gt;townhouse&lt;/a&gt;s, such as the &lt;a href=\"Mansion%20House%2C%20York\"&gt;Lord Mayor's Mansion House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%20House\"&gt;Fairfax House&lt;/a&gt; date from this period, as do the &lt;a href=\"York%20Assembly%20Rooms\"&gt;Assembly Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20Royal%2C%20York\"&gt;Theatre Royal&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"York%20Racecourse\"&gt;racecourse&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern history.\nThe railway promoter &lt;a href=\"George%20Hudson\"&gt;George Hudson&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for bringing the railway to York in 1839. Although Hudson's career as a railway entrepreneur ended in disgrace and bankruptcy, his promotion of York over Leeds, and of his own railway company (the &lt;a href=\"York%20and%20North%20Midland%20Railway\"&gt;York and North Midland Railway&lt;/a&gt;), helped establish York as a major railway centre by the late 19th century.\nThe introduction of the railways established engineering in the city. At the turn of the 20th\u00a0century, the railway accommodated the headquarters and works of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28UK%29\"&gt;North Eastern Railway&lt;/a&gt;, which employed more than 5,500 people. The railway was instrumental in the expansion of &lt;a href=\"Rowntree%27s\"&gt;Rowntree's Cocoa Works&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded in 1862 by Henry Isaac Rowntree, who was joined in 1869 by his brother the philanthropist &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Rowntree%20%28Philanthropist%29\"&gt;Joseph&lt;/a&gt;. Another chocolate manufacturer, &lt;a href=\"Terry%27s\"&gt;Terry's of York&lt;/a&gt;, was a major employer. By 1900, the railways and confectionery had become the city's two major industries.\nYork was a centre of &lt;a href=\"early%20photography\"&gt;early photography&lt;/a&gt;, as described by Hugh Murray in his 1986 book \"Photographs and Photographers of York: The Early Years, 1844\u201379\". Photographers who had studios in York included &lt;a href=\"William%20Hayes%20%28photographer%29\"&gt;William Hayes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Pumphrey\"&gt;William Pumphrey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20Mahalski\"&gt;Augustus Mahalski&lt;/a&gt; who operated on &lt;a href=\"Davygate\"&gt;Davygate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Low%20Petergate\"&gt;Low Petergate&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century, having come to England as a refugee after serving as a &lt;a href=\"Uhlan\"&gt;Polish lancer&lt;/a&gt; in the Austro-Hungarian war.\nIn 1942, the city was bombed during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; (part of the &lt;a href=\"Baedeker%20Blitz\"&gt;Baedeker Blitz&lt;/a&gt;) by the German &lt;a href=\"Luftwaffe\"&gt;Luftwaffe&lt;/a&gt; and 92 people were killed and hundreds injured. Buildings damaged in the raid included the &lt;a href=\"York%20railway%20station\"&gt;Railway Station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rowntree%27s\"&gt;Rowntree's&lt;/a&gt; Factory, Poppleton Road Primary School, St Martin-le-Grand Church, the &lt;a href=\"Bar%20Convent\"&gt;Bar Convent&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Guildhall%2C%20York\"&gt;Guildhall&lt;/a&gt; which was left in total disrepair until 1960.\nWith the emergence of tourism, the historic core of York became one of the city's major assets, and in 1968 it was designated a &lt;a href=\"conservation%20area\"&gt;conservation area&lt;/a&gt;. The existing tourist attractions were supplemented by the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Railway%20Museum\"&gt;National Railway Museum&lt;/a&gt; in York in 1975, the &lt;a href=\"Jorvik%20Viking%20Centre\"&gt;Jorvik Viking Centre&lt;/a&gt; in 1984 and the &lt;a href=\"York%20Dungeon\"&gt;York Dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in 1986. The opening of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20York\"&gt;University of York&lt;/a&gt; in 1963 added to the prosperity of the city. In March 2012, &lt;a href=\"York%27s%20Chocolate%20Story\"&gt;York's Chocolate Story&lt;/a&gt; opened.\nYork was voted European Tourism City of the Year by European Cities Marketing in June 2007, beating 130 other European cities to gain first place, surpassing &lt;a href=\"Gothenburg\"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; in Sweden (second) and &lt;a href=\"Valencia%2C%20Spain\"&gt;Valencia&lt;/a&gt; in Spain (third). York was also voted safest place to visit in the 2010 \"&lt;a href=\"Cond%C3%A9%20Nast%20Traveller\"&gt;Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller&lt;/a&gt;\" Readers' Choice Awards. In 2018, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sunday%20Times\"&gt;The Sunday Times&lt;/a&gt;\" deemed York to be its overall 'Best Place to Live' in Britain, highlighting the city's \"perfect mix of heritage and hi-tech\" and as a \"mini-metropolis with cool cafes, destination restaurants, innovative companies \u2013 plus the fastest internet in Britain\". The result was confirmed in a &lt;a href=\"YouGov\"&gt;YouGov&lt;/a&gt; survey, reported in August 2018, with 92% of respondents saying that they liked the city, more than any of 56 other British cities.\nGovernance.\nLocal.\nThe City of York is governed by the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20York%20Council\"&gt;City of York Council&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=\"unitary%20authority\"&gt;unitary authority&lt;/a&gt; that operates on a &lt;a href=\"leader%20and%20cabinet\"&gt;leader and cabinet&lt;/a&gt; style of governance, having the powers of a non-metropolitan county and district council combined. It provides a full range of local government services including Council Tax billing, libraries, social services, processing planning applications, waste collection and disposal, and it is a local education authority. The city council consists of 47 councillors representing 21 &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28electoral%20subdivision%29\"&gt;wards&lt;/a&gt;, with two or three per ward serving four-year terms. Its headquarters are at the &lt;a href=\"York%20Guildhall\"&gt;Guildhall&lt;/a&gt; and West Offices in the city centre.\nYork is divided into 21 administrative wards: &lt;a href=\"Acomb%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Acomb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bishopthorpe\"&gt;Bishopthorpe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clifton%2C%20York\"&gt;Clifton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Copmanthorpe\"&gt;Copmanthorpe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dringhouses\"&gt;Dringhouses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Woodthorpe%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Woodthorpe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fishergate\"&gt;Fishergate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fulford%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Fulford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heslington\"&gt;Heslington&lt;/a&gt;, Guildhall, &lt;a href=\"Haxby\"&gt;Haxby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wigginton%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Wigginton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heworth%2C%20York\"&gt;Heworth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heworth%20Without\"&gt;Heworth Without&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holgate%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Holgate&lt;/a&gt;, Hull Road, &lt;a href=\"Huntington%2C%20City%20of%20York\"&gt;Huntington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Earswick\"&gt;New Earswick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Micklegate\"&gt;Micklegate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Osbaldwick\"&gt;Osbaldwick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Derwent%20%28ward%29\"&gt;Derwent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rawcliffe%2C%20York\"&gt;Rawcliffe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clifton%20Without\"&gt;Clifton Without&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rural%20West%20York\"&gt;Rural West York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strensall\"&gt;Strensall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfield%2C%20York\"&gt;Westfield&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wheldrake\"&gt;Wheldrake&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe members of the cabinet, led by the &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20City%20of%20York%20Council\"&gt;Council Leader&lt;/a&gt;, makes decisions on their portfolio areas individually. Following the &lt;a href=\"Local%20Government%20Act%202000\"&gt;Local Government Act 2000&lt;/a&gt;, the Council Leader commands the &lt;a href=\"Confidence%20and%20supply\"&gt;confidence&lt;/a&gt; of the city council; the leader of the largest political group and head of the City of York Council. The Leader of the council and the cabinet (consisting of all the executive councillors) are collectively &lt;a href=\"Accountability\"&gt;accountable&lt;/a&gt; for their policies and actions to the city council. The current Council Leader, &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;' Cllr Keith Aspden, was appointed on 22 May 2019, following the &lt;a href=\"2019%20City%20of%20York%20Council%20election\"&gt;2019 City of York Council election&lt;/a&gt;.\nYork's first citizen and civic head is the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mayor%20of%20York\"&gt;Lord Mayor&lt;/a&gt;, who is the &lt;a href=\"chairman\"&gt;chairman&lt;/a&gt; of the City of York Council. The appointment is made by the city council each year in May, at the same time appointing the Sheriff, the city's other civic head. The offices of Lord Mayor and Sheriff are purely ceremonial. The Lord Mayor carries out civic and ceremonial duties in addition to chairing full council meetings. The incumbent Lord Mayor since 27 May 2021 is Councillor Chris Cullwick, and the Sheriff is Councillor Ashley Mason.\nYork Youth Council consists of several young people who negotiate with the councillors to get better facilities for York's young people, and who also elect York's &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Youth%20Parliament\"&gt;Member of Youth Parliament&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a result of the &lt;a href=\"2019%20City%20of%20York%20Council%20election\"&gt;2019 City of York Council election&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; was reduced to two seats. The &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; had 21 councillors. The &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; had 17 councillors and the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Party%20of%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; had four with three Independents. Due to &lt;a href=\"no%20overall%20control\"&gt;no overall control&lt;/a&gt;, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party agreed to form a coalition on 14 May 2019.\nYork is the traditional &lt;a href=\"county%20town\"&gt;county town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore did not form part of any of its three historic &lt;a href=\"Riding%20%28division%29\"&gt;ridings&lt;/a&gt;, or divisions. Its Mayor has had the status of Lord Mayor since 1370. York is an ancient &lt;a href=\"borough\"&gt;borough&lt;/a&gt;, and was reformed by the &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20Corporations%20Act%201835\"&gt;Municipal Corporations Act 1835&lt;/a&gt; to form a &lt;a href=\"municipal%20borough\"&gt;municipal borough&lt;/a&gt;. It gained the status of a &lt;a href=\"county%20borough\"&gt;county borough&lt;/a&gt; in 1889, under the &lt;a href=\"Local%20Government%20Act%201888\"&gt;Local Government Act 1888&lt;/a&gt;, and existed so until 1974, when, under the &lt;a href=\"Local%20Government%20Act%201972\"&gt;Local Government Act 1972&lt;/a&gt;, it became a &lt;a href=\"non-metropolitan%20district\"&gt;non-metropolitan district&lt;/a&gt; in the county of North Yorkshire, whilst retaining its Lord Mayor, its Sheriff and Aldermen. As a result of &lt;a href=\"1990s%20UK%20local%20government%20reform\"&gt;1990s UK local government reform&lt;/a&gt;, York regained unitary status and saw a substantial alteration in its borders, taking in parts of &lt;a href=\"Selby%20%28district%29\"&gt;Selby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harrogate%20%28borough%29\"&gt;Harrogate&lt;/a&gt; districts, and about half the population of the &lt;a href=\"Ryedale\"&gt;Ryedale&lt;/a&gt; district. The new boundary was imposed after central government rejected the former city council's own proposal.\nParliament.\nFrom 1997 to 2010, the central part of the district was covered by the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20York%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;City of York&lt;/a&gt; constituency, while the remainder was split between the constituencies of &lt;a href=\"Ryedale%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Ryedale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Selby%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Selby&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20York%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Vale of York&lt;/a&gt;. These constituencies were represented by &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Bayley\"&gt;Hugh Bayley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Greenway%20%28MP%29\"&gt;John Greenway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Grogan%20%28UK%20politician%29\"&gt;John Grogan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anne%20McIntosh\"&gt;Anne McIntosh&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nFollowing their review in 2003 of parliamentary representation in &lt;a href=\"North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;North Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Boundary%20Commission%20for%20England\"&gt;Boundary Commission for England&lt;/a&gt; recommended the creation of two new seats for the City of York, in time for the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;general election in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. These are &lt;a href=\"York%20Central%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;York Central&lt;/a&gt;, which covers the inner urban area, and is entirely surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"York%20Outer%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;York Outer&lt;/a&gt; constituency.\nCeremonial.\nYork is within the &lt;a href=\"ceremonial%20county\"&gt;ceremonial county&lt;/a&gt; of North Yorkshire and, until 1974, was within the jurisdiction of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20the%20West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Lord Lieutenant of the County of York, West Riding and the County of The City of York&lt;/a&gt;. The city does retain the right to appoint its own Sheriff. The holder of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Duke\"&gt;Royal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20York\"&gt;dukedom of York&lt;/a&gt; has no responsibilities either ceremonially or administratively as regards to the city.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nThe city is north-east of &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;, and is part of the &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20City%20Region\"&gt;Leeds City Region&lt;/a&gt;.\nYork lies in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20York\"&gt;Vale of York&lt;/a&gt;, a flat area of fertile arable land bordered by the &lt;a href=\"Pennines\"&gt;Pennines&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"North%20York%20Moors\"&gt;North York Moors&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Wolds\"&gt;Yorkshire Wolds&lt;/a&gt;. The city was built at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and Foss on a terminal &lt;a href=\"moraine\"&gt;moraine&lt;/a&gt; left by the last &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Age\"&gt;Ice Age&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Roman times, the land surrounding the Ouse and Foss was marshy, making the site easy to defend. The city is prone to flooding from the River Ouse, and has an extensive network of flood defences with walls along the river, and a liftable barrier across the Foss where it joins the Ouse at the \"&lt;a href=\"Bridges%20of%20York%23The%20Blue%20Bridge\"&gt;Blue Bridge&lt;/a&gt;\". In October and November 2000, York experienced the worst flooding in 375 years; more than 300 homes were flooded.\nIn December 2015 the flooding was more extensive and caused major disruption. The extreme impact led to a personal visit by Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"David%20Cameron\"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;. Much land in and around the city is on flood plains too flood-prone for development other than agriculture. The \"&lt;a href=\"ings\"&gt;ings&lt;/a&gt;\" are flood meadows along the Ouse, while the \"&lt;a href=\"Strays%20of%20York\"&gt;strays&lt;/a&gt;\" are open common grassland in various locations around the city.\nClimate.\nYork has a &lt;a href=\"Oceanic%20climate\"&gt;temperate climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;Cfb&lt;/a&gt;) with four distinct seasons. As with the rest of the Vale of York, the city's climate is drier and warmer than the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20and%20the%20Humber\"&gt;Yorkshire and the Humber&lt;/a&gt; region. Owing to its lowland location, York is prone to frosts, fog, and cold winds during winter, spring and very early summer. Snow can fall in winter from December onwards to as late as April but quickly melts. As with much of the British Isles, the weather is changeable. York experiences most sunshine from May to July, an average of six hours per day. With its inland location, summers are often warmer than the Yorkshire coast with temperatures of 27\u00a0\u00b0C or more. Extremes recorded at the University of York campus between 1998 and 2010 include a highest temperature of and a lowest temperature of (6 December 2010). The most rainfall in one day was .\nGreen belt.\nYork is bounded by a green belt area, which more rigorously manages development around the rural area of the district and portions of surrounding districts, primarily to preserve the setting and historic character of York. The belt covers nearly all of the city district including all its outer villages, and extends into the surrounding North Yorkshire districts of &lt;a href=\"Hambleton%20District\"&gt;Hambleton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harrogate%20district\"&gt;Harrogate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryedale\"&gt;Ryedale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Selby%20District\"&gt;Selby&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemography.\nThe York &lt;a href=\"urban%20area\"&gt;urban area&lt;/a&gt; (built-up area) had a population of 153,717 at the time of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011\"&gt;2011 UK census&lt;/a&gt;, compared with 137,505 in 2001. \nThe population of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20York\"&gt;City of York&lt;/a&gt; (Local Authority) was 198,051 and its ethnic composition was 94.3% White, 1.2% Mixed, 3.4% Asian and 0.6% Black. York's elderly population (those 65 and over) was %, however only 13.2% were listed as retired.\nAlso at the time of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001\"&gt;2001 UK census&lt;/a&gt;, the City of York had a total population of 181,094 of whom 93,957 were female and 87,137 were male.

The figures for lone parent households were below the national average of 9.5%, and the percentage of married couples was also close to the national average of 36.5%; the proportion of one person households was slightly higher than the national average of 30.1%.\nIn 2001, the population density was . Of those aged 16\u201374 in York, 24.6% had no academic qualifications, a little lower than 28.9% in all of England. Of York's residents, 5.1% were born outside the United Kingdom, significantly lower than the national average of 9.2%. &lt;a href=\"White%20British\"&gt;White British&lt;/a&gt; form 95% of the population; the largest single minority group was recorded as Asian, at 1.9% of the population.\nThe number of theft-from-a-vehicle offences and theft of a vehicle per 1,000 of the population was 8.8 and 2.7, compared to the English national average of 6.9 and 2.7 respectively. The number of sexual offences was 0.9, in line with the national average. The national average of violence against another person was 16.2 compared to the York average of 17.5.

York's only Mosque is located in the &lt;a href=\"Layerthorpe\"&gt;Layerthorpe&lt;/a&gt; area, and the city also has a &lt;a href=\"UK%20Islamic%20Mission\"&gt;UK Islamic Mission&lt;/a&gt; centre. Various &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; traditions are represented in the city and around York. There is also an active Jewish community.\nEconomy.\nA July 2020 report by Council stated that York is worth \"\u00a35.2 billion to the UK economy ... with 9,000 businesses and 110,000 people employed across the city\". According to \"Make It York\", the city benefits from features that include a well-educated workforce, \"excellent transport links to both national and international markets, pronounced strengths in a range of high value sectors, a pioneering digital infrastructure, outstanding business support networks ...\"\nYork's economy is based on the &lt;a href=\"service%20industry\"&gt;service industry&lt;/a&gt;, which in 2000 was responsible for 88.7% of employment in the city.\nStatistics based on 2019 data indicated that tourism was worth over \u00a3765 million to the city, supported 24,000 jobs and attracted 8.4 million visitors each year.\nThe Employment Rate in 2018 was 78.8%. The private sector accounted for 77,000 jobs in 2019 while 34,500 jobs were in the public sector.\nThe service industries include public sector employment, health, education, finance, information technology (IT) and tourism that accounted for 10.7% of employment as of 2016. Tourism has become an important element of the economy, with the city offering a wealth of historic attractions, of which &lt;a href=\"York%20Minster\"&gt;York Minster&lt;/a&gt; is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural activities. As a holiday destination York was the 6th most visited English city by UK residents (2014\u201316) and the 13th most visited by overseas visitors (2016).\nA 2014 report, based on 2012 data, stated that the city receives 6.9\u00a0million visitors annually; they contribute \u00a3564\u00a0million to the economy and support over 19,000 jobs. In the 2017 Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller survey of readers, York rated 12th among The 15 Best Cities in the UK for visitors. In a 2020 Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller report, York rated as the sixth best among ten \"urban destinations [in the UK] that scored the highest marks when it comes to ... nightlife, restaurants and friendliness\".\nUnemployment in York was low at 4.2% in 2008 compared to the United Kingdom national average of 5.3%. The biggest employer in York is the City of York Council, with over 7,500 employees. Employers with more than 2,000 staff include &lt;a href=\"Aviva\"&gt;Aviva&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Norwich Union Life), &lt;a href=\"Network%20Rail\"&gt;Network Rail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Trains\"&gt;Northern Trains&lt;/a&gt;, York Hospitals NHS Trust and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20York\"&gt;University of York&lt;/a&gt;. Other major employers include &lt;a href=\"BT%20Group\"&gt;BT Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"CPP%20Group\"&gt;CPP Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nestl%C3%A9\"&gt;Nestl\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NFU%20Mutual\"&gt;NFU Mutual&lt;/a&gt; and a number of railway companies.\nA 2007 report stated that the economic position at that time very different from the 1950s, when its prosperity was based on chocolate manufacturing and the railways. This position continued until the early 1980s when 30% of the workforce were employed by just five employers and 75% of manufacturing jobs were in four companies. Most industry around the railway has gone, including the &lt;a href=\"York%20Carriage%20Works\"&gt;York Carriage Works&lt;/a&gt;, which at its height in the 1880s employed 5,500 people, but closed in the mid-1990s. York is the headquarters of the confectionery manufacturer Nestl\u00e9 York (formerly Nestl\u00e9 Rowntrees) and home to the \"&lt;a href=\"KitKat\"&gt;KitKat&lt;/a&gt;\" and eponymous &lt;a href=\"Yorkie%20%28chocolate%20bar%29\"&gt;\"Yorkie\" bar&lt;/a&gt; chocolate brands. &lt;a href=\"Terry%27s\"&gt;Terry's&lt;/a&gt; chocolate factory, makers of the \"&lt;a href=\"Terry%27s%20Chocolate%20Orange\"&gt;Chocolate Orange&lt;/a&gt;\", was located in the city; but it closed on 30 September 2005, when production was moved by its owners, &lt;a href=\"Kraft%20Foods\"&gt;Kraft Foods&lt;/a&gt;, to Poland. The historic factory building is situated next to the Knavesmire racecourse.\nOn 20 September 2006, Nestl\u00e9 announced that it would cut 645 jobs at the Rowntree's chocolate factory in York. This came after a number of other job losses in the city at &lt;a href=\"Aviva\"&gt;Aviva&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"British%20Sugar\"&gt;British Sugar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Chocolate%20Works\"&gt;Terry's chocolate factory&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the employment situation in York remained fairly buoyant until the effects of the &lt;a href=\"late%202000s%20recession\"&gt;late 2000s recession&lt;/a&gt; began to be felt.\nSince the closure of the carriage works, the site has been developed into offices. York's economy has been developing in the areas of science, technology and the &lt;a href=\"creative%20industries\"&gt;creative industries&lt;/a&gt;. The city became a founding National Science City with the creation of a &lt;a href=\"science%20park\"&gt;science park&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20York\"&gt;University of York&lt;/a&gt;. Between 1998 and 2008 York gained 80 new technology companies and 2,800 new jobs in the sector.\nRegional &lt;a href=\"gross%20value%20added\"&gt;gross value added&lt;/a&gt; figures for York, at 2005 basic prices in millions of &lt;a href=\"pounds%20sterling\"&gt;pounds sterling&lt;/a&gt;, are:\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 and 2021 caused a slowdown because of restrictions imposed on businesses and on travel in the UK. By January 2021, many cities were in their third lockdown and \"Britain\u2019s jobless rate has soared to its highest level for more than four years\". The \"retail, hospitality and tourism sector\" was especially hard hit in York. In August 2020, \"Make It York\" and City of York Council embarked on a six-month tourism marketing plan \"to reenergise the city while building resident and visitor confidence\".\nIn addition to high unemployment during lockdown periods, one analysis (by the York and North Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership) predicted in August 2020 that \"as many as 13,835 jobs in York will be lost in the scenario considered most likely, taking the city\u2019s unemployment rate to 14.5%\". Some critics claimed that part of the problem was caused by \"over-reliance on the booming tourism industry at the expense of a long-term economic plan\". A report in mid June 2020 stated that unemployment had risen 114 per cent over the previous year because of restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic.\nOther analyses suggested that \"York is well-placed for the high street to recover and evolve from the pandemic if new businesses focus on creating an attraction or experience rather than traditional retail\" The North Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership also \"predicted a significant rise in staycation trips to York in 2021\".\nPublic services.\nUnder the requirements of the &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20Corporations%20Act%201835\"&gt;Municipal Corporations Act 1835&lt;/a&gt;, York City Council appointed a &lt;a href=\"watch%20committee\"&gt;watch committee&lt;/a&gt; which established a police force and appointed a chief constable. On 1 June 1968 the York City, East Riding of Yorkshire and North Riding of Yorkshire police forces were amalgamated to form the &lt;a href=\"York%20and%20North%20East%20Yorkshire%20Police\"&gt;York and North East Yorkshire Police&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1974, &lt;a href=\"Home%20Office\"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt; policing in York has been provided by the &lt;a href=\"North%20Yorkshire%20Police\"&gt;North Yorkshire Police&lt;/a&gt;. The force's central headquarters for policing York and nearby &lt;a href=\"Selby%20%28district%29\"&gt;Selby&lt;/a&gt; are in Fulford.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20service%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Statutory emergency fire and rescue service&lt;/a&gt; is provided by the &lt;a href=\"North%20Yorkshire%20Fire%20and%20Rescue%20Service\"&gt;North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service&lt;/a&gt;, whose headquarters is at &lt;a href=\"Northallerton\"&gt;Northallerton&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city's first hospital, &lt;a href=\"York%20County%20Hospital\"&gt;York County Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, opened in 1740 in Monkgate funded by public subscription. It closed in 1976 when it was replaced by &lt;a href=\"York%20Hospital\"&gt;York Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, which opened the same year and gained &lt;a href=\"NHS%20foundation%20trust\"&gt;Foundation status&lt;/a&gt; in April 2007. It has 524 adult inpatient beds and 127 special purpose beds providing general healthcare and some specialist inpatient, daycase and outpatient services. It is also known as York District Hospital and YDH.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Ambulance%20Service\"&gt;Yorkshire Ambulance Service&lt;/a&gt; NHS Trust was formed on 1 July 2006 bringing together South Yorkshire Ambulance Service, West Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and the North and East Yorkshire parts of Tees, East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service to provide patient transport. Other forms of health care are provided for locally by clinics and surgeries.\nThe city's first subscription library opened in 1794. The first free &lt;a href=\"public%20library\"&gt;public library&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"York%20Library\"&gt;York Library&lt;/a&gt;, was built on &lt;a href=\"Clifford%20Street%20%28York%29\"&gt;Clifford Street&lt;/a&gt; in 1893, to mark &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt;'s jubilee. A new building was erected on &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Street%20%28York%29\"&gt;Museum Street&lt;/a&gt; in 1927, and this is still the library today; it was extended in 1934 and 1938.\nSince 1998 &lt;a href=\"waste%20management\"&gt;waste management&lt;/a&gt; has been co-ordinated via the York and North Yorkshire Waste Partnership. York's &lt;a href=\"distribution%20network%20operator\"&gt;distribution network operator&lt;/a&gt; for electricity is &lt;a href=\"CE%20Electric%20UK\"&gt;CE Electric UK&lt;/a&gt;; there are no &lt;a href=\"power%20station\"&gt;power station&lt;/a&gt;s in the city. &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Water\"&gt;Yorkshire Water&lt;/a&gt;, which has a local water extraction plant on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Derwent%2C%20Yorkshire\"&gt;River Derwent&lt;/a&gt; at Elvington, manages York's &lt;a href=\"drinking%20water\"&gt;drinking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"waste%20water\"&gt;waste water&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city has a &lt;a href=\"magistrates%27%20court%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29\"&gt;magistrates' court&lt;/a&gt;, and venues for the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Court\"&gt;Crown Court&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"County%20Court%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29\"&gt;County Court&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crown Court House was designed by the architect &lt;a href=\"John%20Carr%20%28architect%29\"&gt;John Carr&lt;/a&gt;, next to the then prison (including execution area).\nBetween 1773 and 1777, the Grand Jury House was replaced by John Carr's elegant Court House for the &lt;a href=\"Assizes\"&gt;Assizes&lt;/a&gt; of the whole county. The Female Prison was built opposite and mirrors the court building positioned around a circular lawn which became known as the \"Eye of the Ridings\", or the \"Eye of York\".\n1776 saw the last recorded instance of a wife hanged and burnt for poisoning her husband. &lt;a href=\"Horse%20theft\"&gt;Horse theft&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"capital%20offence\"&gt;capital offence&lt;/a&gt;. The culprits of lesser crimes were brought to court by the city constables and would face a fine. The corporation employed a \"common informer\" whose task was to bring criminals to justice.\nThe former prison is now the &lt;a href=\"York%20Castle%20Museum\"&gt;Castle Museum&lt;/a&gt; but still contains the cells.\nTransport.\nWater.\nYork's location on the River Ouse, and in the centre of the Vale of York, means that it has always had a significant position in the nation's transport system. The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the Ouse and the Foss. The Ouse was originally a &lt;a href=\"tidal%20river\"&gt;tidal river&lt;/a&gt;, accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today, both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A &lt;a href=\"canal%20lock\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Naburn\"&gt;Naburn&lt;/a&gt; on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal.\nUntil the end of the 20th\u00a0century, the Ouse was used by &lt;a href=\"barge\"&gt;barge&lt;/a&gt;s to carry freight between York and the port of &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20upon%20Hull\"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt;. The last significant such traffic was the supply of &lt;a href=\"newsprint\"&gt;newsprint&lt;/a&gt; to the local newspaper's Foss-side print works, which continued until 1997. Today, navigation is almost exclusively leisure-oriented.\nRoads.\nLike most cities founded by the Romans, York is well served by long-distance trunk roads. The city lies at the intersection of the &lt;a href=\"A19%20road\"&gt;A19 road&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Doncaster\"&gt;Doncaster&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tyneside\"&gt;Tyneside&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"A59%20road\"&gt;A59 road&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; to York, the &lt;a href=\"A64%20road\"&gt;A64 road&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Scarborough&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"A1079%20road\"&gt;A1079 road&lt;/a&gt; from York to &lt;a href=\"Kingston%20upon%20Hull\"&gt;Hull&lt;/a&gt;. The A64 road provides the principal link to the motorway network, linking York to both the &lt;a href=\"A1%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;A1(M)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"M1%20motorway\"&gt;M1 motorway&lt;/a&gt;s at a distance of about from the city. The trans-Pennine &lt;a href=\"M62%20motorway\"&gt;M62 motorway&lt;/a&gt; is less than away providing links to &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; and Liverpool.\nThe city is surrounded on all sides by an outer ring road, at a distance of some from the centre of the city, which allows through traffic to by-pass the city. The street plan of the historic core of the city dates from medieval times and is not suitable for modern traffic. As a consequence, many of the routes inside the city walls are designated as &lt;a href=\"Car-free%20zone\"&gt;car-free&lt;/a&gt; during business hours or restrict traffic entirely. To alleviate this situation, six bus-based &lt;a href=\"York%20Park%20and%20Ride\"&gt;park and ride&lt;/a&gt; sites operate in York. The sites are located towards the edge of the urban area, with easy access from the ring road and allow out of town visitors to complete their journey into the city centre by bus.\nRailway.\nYork has been a major railway centre since the first line arrived in 1839, at the beginning of the railway age. For many years, the city hosted the headquarters and works of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28UK%29\"&gt;North Eastern Railway&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"York%20railway%20station\"&gt;York railway station&lt;/a&gt; is a principal stop on the &lt;a href=\"East%20Coast%20Main%20Line\"&gt;East Coast Main Line&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne\"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;. It takes less than two hours to get to York from London by rail, with at least 25 direct trains each weekday. The station is also served by long-distance trains on &lt;a href=\"CrossCountry\"&gt;CrossCountry&lt;/a&gt; services, which link Edinburgh and Newcastle to destinations in south and west England via &lt;a href=\"Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"TransPennine%20Express\"&gt;TransPennine Express&lt;/a&gt; provide a frequent service of semi-fast trains linking York to Newcastle, Scarborough, Middlesbrough, Leeds, Manchester, &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Airport\"&gt;Manchester Airport&lt;/a&gt; and Liverpool. Local stopping services by &lt;a href=\"Northern%20%28train%20operating%20company%29\"&gt;Northern&lt;/a&gt; connect York to Selby, &lt;a href=\"Harrogate\"&gt;Harrogate&lt;/a&gt;, Hull, Leeds, &lt;a href=\"Sheffield\"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt; and many intermediate points, as well as many other stations across Greater Manchester and Lancashire.\nAir.\nThe closest international airports are &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Bradford\"&gt;Leeds Bradford&lt;/a&gt; at , &lt;a href=\"EGNV\"&gt;Teesside&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20Sheffield\"&gt;Doncaster Sheffield&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"EGNJ\"&gt;Humberside&lt;/a&gt; . Further afield are &lt;a href=\"EGCC\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"EGNT\"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; .\nManchester Airport - with connections to Europe, North America, Africa and Asia - has direct rail links by &lt;a href=\"TransPennine%20Express\"&gt;TPE&lt;/a&gt; with its . By road its accessible by the &lt;a href=\"A64%20road\"&gt;A64&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"M60%20motorway\"&gt;M60&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"A1%28M%29\"&gt;A1(M)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M1%20motorway\"&gt;M1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M62%20motorway\"&gt;M62&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeesside Airport has one connection via and with a limited service with a bus from to the airport. By road, it is accessible by the &lt;a href=\"A19%20road\"&gt;A19&lt;/a&gt; north to the &lt;a href=\"A67%20road\"&gt;A67&lt;/a&gt;. Newcastle Airport has one connection via with the metro to , it is accessible by the &lt;a href=\"A1%28M%29\"&gt;A1(M)&lt;/a&gt; north to the &lt;a href=\"A1%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;A1&lt;/a&gt; then the &lt;a href=\"A696%20road\"&gt;A696&lt;/a&gt;.\nLBA and Humberside have no direct station with buses from the nearest stations. LBA serves most major European and North African airports, as well as &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Humberside is accessible by the &lt;a href=\"A1079\"&gt;A1079&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"A15%20road%20%28England%29\"&gt;A15&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"A63%20road\"&gt;A63&lt;/a&gt;; LBA by the &lt;a href=\"A59%20road\"&gt;A59&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"A658%20road\"&gt;A658&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"A661%20road\"&gt;A661&lt;/a&gt;.\nYork has an airfield at the former &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Elvington\"&gt;RAF Elvington&lt;/a&gt;, south-east of the city centre, which is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Air%20Museum\"&gt;Yorkshire Air Museum&lt;/a&gt; and used for &lt;a href=\"private%20aviation\"&gt;private aviation&lt;/a&gt;. In 2003, plans were drafted to expand the site for business aviation or a full commercial service. Former &lt;a href=\"RAF%20Church%20Fenton\"&gt;RAF Church Fenton&lt;/a&gt; is also near the city and private, it is now called &lt;a href=\"EGXG\"&gt;East Leeds&lt;/a&gt;.\nBus.\nPublic transport within the city is largely bus-based. &lt;a href=\"First%20York\"&gt;First York&lt;/a&gt; operates the majority of the city's local bus services, as well as the &lt;a href=\"York%20park%20and%20ride\"&gt;York park and ride&lt;/a&gt; services. York was the location of the first implementation of FirstGroup's experimental and controversial &lt;a href=\"FTR%20%28bus%29\"&gt;FTR bus concept&lt;/a&gt;, which sought to confer the advantages of a modern tramway system at a lower cost. The service was withdrawn following an election manifesto pledge by the Labour Group at the 2011 local government election. &lt;a href=\"Transdev%20York\"&gt;Transdev York&lt;/a&gt; also operates a large number of local bus services. Open-top tourist and sightseeing buses are operated by Transdev York, on behalf of &lt;a href=\"City%20Sightseeing\"&gt;City Sightseeing&lt;/a&gt;.\nRural services, linking local towns and villages with York, are provided by a number of companies with Transdev York, EYMS and Reliance operating most of them.\nLonger-distance bus services are provided by a number of operators, including &lt;a href=\"Arriva%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Arriva Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; services to Selby, &lt;a href=\"East%20Yorkshire%20Motor%20Services\"&gt;East Yorkshire Motor Services&lt;/a&gt; routes to Hull, Beverley, Driffield, Market Weighton and Pocklington, and &lt;a href=\"Harrogate%20Bus%20Company\"&gt;Harrogate Bus Company&lt;/a&gt; services to &lt;a href=\"Knaresborough\"&gt;Knaresborough&lt;/a&gt; and Harrogate. &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Coastliner\"&gt;Yorkshire Coastliner&lt;/a&gt; links Leeds via York with Scarborough, &lt;a href=\"Filey\"&gt;Filey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bridlington\"&gt;Bridlington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whitby\"&gt;Whitby&lt;/a&gt;.\nEducation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20York\"&gt;University of York&lt;/a&gt;'s main campus is on the southern edge of the city at &lt;a href=\"Heslington\"&gt;Heslington&lt;/a&gt;. The Department of Archaeology and the graduate Centres for Eighteenth Century Studies and Medieval Studies are located in the historic King's Manor in the city centre. It was York's only institution with university status until 2006, when the more centrally located &lt;a href=\"York%20St%20John%20University\"&gt;York St John University&lt;/a&gt;, formerly an autonomous college of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Leeds\"&gt;University of Leeds&lt;/a&gt;, attained full university status. The city formerly hosted a branch of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Law\"&gt;University of Law&lt;/a&gt; before it moved to Leeds. The University of York also has a medical school, &lt;a href=\"Hull%20York%20Medical%20School\"&gt;Hull York Medical School&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city has two major further education institutions. &lt;a href=\"York%20College%20%28York%29\"&gt;York College&lt;/a&gt; is an amalgamation of York Technical College and York Sixth Form College. Students there study a very wide range of academic and vocational courses, and range from &lt;a href=\"School%20leaving%20age\"&gt;school leavers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sixth%20form\"&gt;sixth form&lt;/a&gt;ers to people training to make career moves. &lt;a href=\"Askham%20Bryan%20College\"&gt;Askham Bryan College&lt;/a&gt; offers further education courses, foundation and honours degrees, specialising in more vocational subjects such as horticulture, agriculture, animal management and even &lt;a href=\"golf%20course\"&gt;golf course&lt;/a&gt; management.\nThere are 70 &lt;a href=\"Local%20Education%20Authority\"&gt;local council&lt;/a&gt; schools with over 24,000 pupils in the City of York Council area. The City of York Council manages most primary and secondary schools within the city. Primary schools cover education from ages 5\u201311, with some offering early years education from age 3. From 11 to 16 education is provided by 10 secondary schools, four of which offer additional education up to the age of 18. In 2007 Oaklands Sports College and Lowfield Comprehensive School merged to become one school known as &lt;a href=\"York%20High%20School%2C%20York\"&gt;York High School&lt;/a&gt;.\nYork also has several private schools. &lt;a href=\"St%20Peter%27s%20School%2C%20York\"&gt;St Peter's School&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 627. The scholar &lt;a href=\"Alcuin\"&gt;Alcuin&lt;/a&gt;, who went on to serve &lt;a href=\"Charlemagne\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/a&gt;, taught there. It was also the school attended by &lt;a href=\"Guy%20Fawkes\"&gt;Guy Fawkes&lt;/a&gt;. Two schools have &lt;a href=\"Quaker\"&gt;Quaker&lt;/a&gt; origins: &lt;a href=\"Bootham%20School\"&gt;Bootham School&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"co-education\"&gt;co-education&lt;/a&gt;al and &lt;a href=\"The%20Mount%20School%2C%20York\"&gt;The Mount School&lt;/a&gt; is all-girls. Another all-girls school is &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Margaret%27s%20School%2C%20York\"&gt;Queen Margaret's&lt;/a&gt; School, which was established under the Woodard Foundation.\nCulture.\nTheatre.\nThe &lt;a href=\"York%20Theatre%20Royal\"&gt;Theatre Royal&lt;/a&gt;, which was established in 1744, produces an annual pantomime which attracts loyal audiences from around the country. This to see its veteran star, &lt;a href=\"Berwick%20Kaler\"&gt;Berwick Kaler&lt;/a&gt;, until he retired from acting in the pantomime in 2019, before officially parting ways with the theatre after the so-called \"Panto Wars\". The Theatre Royal continues to produce an annual pantomime without Kaler, who came out of retirement in 2021 to star in a new panto at The &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Opera%20House%2C%20York\"&gt;Grand Opera House&lt;/a&gt;. Both the Grand Opera House and Joseph Rowntree Theatre also offer a variety of productions. The city is home to the &lt;a href=\"Riding%20Lights%20Theatre%20Company\"&gt;Riding Lights Theatre Company&lt;/a&gt;, which as well as operating a busy national touring department, also operates a busy youth theatre and educational departments. York is also home to a number of amateur dramatic groups. The Department of Theatre, Film and Television and Student Societies of the University of York put on public drama performances.\nThe &lt;a href=\"York%20Mystery%20Plays\"&gt;York Mystery Plays&lt;/a&gt; are performed in public at intervals, using texts based on the original medieval plays of this type that were performed by the guilds \u2013 often with specific connections to the subject matter of each play. (For instance the Shipwrights' Play is the \"Building of Noah's Ark\" and the fish-sellers and mariners the \"Landing of Noah's Ark\"). The York Cycle of Mystery Plays or Pageants is the most complete in England. Originally performed from wagons at various locations around the city from the 14th century until 1570, they were revived in 1951 during the &lt;a href=\"Festival%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Festival of Britain&lt;/a&gt;, when York was one of the cities with a regional festival. They became part of the York City Festival every three years and later four years. They were mostly produced in a temporary open-air theatre within the ruins of St Mary's Abbey, using some professional but mostly amateur actors. Lead actors have included &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Timothy\"&gt;Christopher Timothy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robson%20Green\"&gt;Robson Green&lt;/a&gt; (in the role of Christ) and Dame &lt;a href=\"Judi%20Dench\"&gt;Judi Dench&lt;/a&gt; as a school girl, in 1951, 1954 and 1957. (She remains a Patron of the plays). The cycle was presented in the Theatre Royal in 1992 and 1996, within York Minster in 2000 and in 2002, 2006 and 2010 by Guild groups from wagons in the squares, in the &lt;a href=\"Dean%27s%20Park\"&gt;Dean's Park&lt;/a&gt;, or at the Eye of York. They go around the streets, recreating the original productions. In 2012, the York Mystery Plays were performed between 2 and 27 August at &lt;a href=\"St%20Mary%27s%20Abbey%2C%20York\"&gt;St Mary's Abbey&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"York%20Museum%20Gardens\"&gt;York Museum Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nMusic.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20St%20Olave%27s\"&gt;Academy of St Olave's&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"chamber%20orchestra\"&gt;chamber orchestra&lt;/a&gt; which gives concerts in &lt;a href=\"St%20Olave%27s%20Church%2C%20York\"&gt;St Olave's Church, Marygate&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the music groups that perform regularly in York. A former church, &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20churches%20of%20York%23St%20Margaret%2C%20Walmgate\"&gt;St Margaret's, Walmgate&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"National%20Centre%20for%20Early%20Music\"&gt;National Centre for Early Music&lt;/a&gt;, which hosts concerts, broadcasts, competitions and events including the &lt;a href=\"York%20Early%20Music%20Festival\"&gt;York Early Music Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Students, staff and visiting artists of &lt;a href=\"York%20St%20John%20University\"&gt;York St John University&lt;/a&gt; music department regularly perform lunchtime concerts in the university chapel. The staff and students of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20York\"&gt;University of York&lt;/a&gt; also perform in the city.\nFood and drink events.\nEach September since 1997, York has held an annual Festival of Food and Drink. The aim of the festival is to spotlight food culture in York and North Yorkshire by promoting local food production. The Festival attracts up to 150,000 visitors over 10 days from all over the country.\nThe Assize of Ale is an annual event in the city where people in medieval costume take part in a &lt;a href=\"pub%20crawl\"&gt;pub crawl&lt;/a&gt; to raise money for local charities. It has its origins in the 13th century, when an &lt;a href=\"Assize%20of%20Bread%20and%20Ale\"&gt;Assize of Bread and Ale&lt;/a&gt; was used to regulate the quality of goods. The current version was resurrected in 1990/91 by the then Sheriff of York, Peter Brown, and is led by the Guild of Scriveners.\nThe Knavesmire, home of York Racecourse, plays host to Yorkshire's largest beer festival every September run by York CAMRA \u2013 York Beer &amp; Cider Festival. It is housed in a marquee opposite the grandstand of the racecourse in the enclosure and in 2016 offered over 450 real ales and over 100 ciders.\nYork ham.\nOne of the notable local products is York ham, a mild-flavoured &lt;a href=\"ham\"&gt;ham&lt;/a&gt; with delicate pink colouring. It is traditionally served with &lt;a href=\"Madeira%20wine%23Uses\"&gt;Madeira Sauce&lt;/a&gt;. As a lightly smoked, dry-cured ham, York ham is saltier but milder in flavour than other European dry-cured hams. Folklore has it that the oak construction for York Minster provided the sawdust for smoking the ham. Robert Burrow Atkinson's butchery shop, in &lt;a href=\"Blossom%20Street\"&gt;Blossom Street&lt;/a&gt;, is claimed to be the birthplace of the original \"York Ham\", or at least to have made it famous.\nUNESCO status bids.\nIn 2010, York's city council and a number of heritage organisations submitted a bid for York's entire city centre to become a &lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"World%20Heritage%20Site\"&gt;World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;. This nomination, to the UK's &lt;a href=\"Department%20for%20Culture%2C%20Media%20and%20Sport\"&gt;Department for Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/a&gt; would have included York on a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Tentative%20list\"&gt;list of tentative sites&lt;/a&gt; to be reviewed by UNESCO itself. York's bid failed, leading to 'disappointment' from the team involved. This indirectly led to the city making a successful bid to be part of the UNESCO &lt;a href=\"Creative%20Cities%20Network\"&gt;Creative Cities Network&lt;/a&gt; as a city of \"Media Arts\".\nAttractions.\nArchitecture.\n&lt;a href=\"York%20Minster\"&gt;York Minster&lt;/a&gt;, a large &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt; cathedral, dominates the city.\n&lt;a href=\"York%20Castle\"&gt;York Castle&lt;/a&gt;, a complex of buildings ranging from the medieval Clifford's Tower to the 20th-century entrance to the &lt;a href=\"York%20Castle%20Museum\"&gt;York Castle Museum&lt;/a&gt; (formerly a prison) has had a chequered history.\nYork's centre is enclosed by &lt;a href=\"York%20city%20walls\"&gt;the city's medieval walls&lt;/a&gt;, which are a popular walk. These defences are the most complete in England. They have the only walls set on high ramparts and they retain all their principal gateways. They incorporate part of the walls of the Roman fortress and some Norman and medieval work, as well as 19th- and 20th-century renovations.\nThe entire circuit is approximately , and encloses an area of . The north-east section includes a part where walls never existed, because the Norman &lt;a href=\"moat\"&gt;moat&lt;/a&gt; of York Castle, formed by damming the &lt;a href=\"River%20Foss\"&gt;River Foss&lt;/a&gt;, also created a lake which acted as a city defence.

Its unusual name comes from an old English term for an open-air slaughterhouse or\u00a0meat market. Most of these premises were once butchers' shops, and the hooks from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains the Shrine of &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Clitherow\"&gt;Margaret Clitherow&lt;/a&gt;, although it is not located in the house where she lived. &lt;a href=\"Goodramgate\"&gt;Goodramgate&lt;/a&gt; has many medieval houses including the early-14th\u2011century &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Row\"&gt;Lady Row&lt;/a&gt; built to finance a &lt;a href=\"Chantry\"&gt;Chantry&lt;/a&gt;, at the edge of the churchyard of &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Goodramgate%2C%20York\"&gt;Holy Trinity church&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs well as the Castle Museum, the city contains numerous other museums and historic buildings such as the &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Museum\"&gt;Yorkshire Museum&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Museum%20Gardens\"&gt;Museum Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jorvik%20Viking%20Centre\"&gt;Jorvik Viking Centre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"York%20Art%20Gallery\"&gt;York Art Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Richard%20III%20Experience%20at%20Monk%20Bar\"&gt;Richard III Experience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Adventurers%27%20Hall\"&gt;Merchant Adventurers' Hall&lt;/a&gt;, the reconstructed medieval house &lt;a href=\"Barley%20Hall\"&gt;Barley Hall&lt;/a&gt; (owned by the &lt;a href=\"York%20Archaeological%20Trust\"&gt;York Archaeological Trust&lt;/a&gt;), the 18th-century &lt;a href=\"Fairfax%20House\"&gt;Fairfax House&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mansion%20House%2C%20York\"&gt;Mansion House&lt;/a&gt; (the historic home of the Lord Mayor) and the so-called &lt;a href=\"Treasurer%27s%20House%2C%20York\"&gt;Treasurer's House&lt;/a&gt; (owned by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;National Trust&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"National%20Railway%20Museum\"&gt;National Railway Museum&lt;/a&gt; is situated just beyond the station, and is home to a vast range of transport material and the largest collection of railway locomotives in the world.

Bettys' founder, Frederick Belmont, travelled on the maiden voyage of the \"&lt;a href=\"RMS%20Queen%20Mary\"&gt;Queen Mary&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1936. He was so impressed by the splendour of the ship that he employed the Queen Mary's designers and craftsmen to turn a dilapidated furniture store in York into an elegant caf\u00e9 in St Helen's Square. A few years after Bettys opened in York war broke out, and the basement 'Bettys Bar' became a favourite haunt of the thousands of airmen stationed around York. 'Bettys Mirror', on which many of them engraved their signatures with a diamond pen, remains on display today as a tribute to them.\nMedia.\nThe York area is served by a local newspaper, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Press%20%28York%29\"&gt;The Press&lt;/a&gt;\" (known as the \"Evening Press\" until April 2006), \"The York Advertiser\" newspaper (based at \"The Press\" on Walmgate), and four local radio stations: &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Radio%20York\"&gt;BBC Radio York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"YorkMix%20Radio\"&gt;YorkMix Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"YO1%20Radio\"&gt;YO1 Radio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jorvik%20Radio\"&gt;Jorvik Radio&lt;/a&gt;.
