They play their home games at Brinsford Lane, and also compete in the &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20Senior%20Cup\"&gt;Walsall Senior Cup&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 a competition they last won in 2000\u201301.\nHistory.\nWolverhampton Casuals Football Club was established in 1899. They joined West Midlands (Regional) League Division Two in 1982\u201383 and were promoted to Division One the following season. They finished runners-up in Division One for three successive seasons, and were promoted to the Premier Division in 1987\u201388 after a fourth-place finish. The club reached the First Round of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Vase\"&gt;FA Vase&lt;/a&gt; in 1989\u201390, however The Cassies were relegated back to Division One in 1991. They regained their Premier Division status after winning the league in 1994\u201395. \nIn 2010\u201311, the club were runners-up in the League Cup. \nFor the 2011\u201312 season local management duo Lee Cooke and Carl Abbott took control of the first team, and following a squad rebuild guided the side to at the time, its best ever, 3rd-place finish in the Premier Division.\nMidway through the 2012-13 season, with the side in 4th place in the table, Lee Cooke resigned his position as joint manager on 15 December 2012. Carl Abbott took sole charge of the first team. During the course of the 2012-13 season Casuals reached the first qualifying round of the &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt;, taking &lt;a href=\"Midland%20Alliance\"&gt;Midland Alliance&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Tividale%20F.C.\"&gt;Tividale&lt;/a&gt; to a replay, before going out, having disposed of &lt;a href=\"Tipton%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Tipton Town&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pilkington%20XXX%20F.C.\"&gt;Pilkington XXX&lt;/a&gt; in earlier rounds. The team finished the season again in 3rd place, in a tightly contested championship with &lt;a href=\"Lye%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Lye Town&lt;/a&gt; and eventual winners &lt;a href=\"AFC%20Wulfrunians\"&gt;AFC Wulfrunians&lt;/a&gt;, achieving 97 points for the season, a best ever league record achieved. Casuals also ended the season as runners up in the &lt;a href=\"JW%20Hunt%20Cup\"&gt;JW Hunt Cup&lt;/a&gt;, finalists for the first time in the club's history, narrowly losing out in the final to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Country%20Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Black Country Rangers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following season the team secured their third consecutive 3rd-placed finish in the Premier Division, this time achieving 98 points, again a best ever league record achieved in the club's history, and only 3 points short of the title. At the end of the season, after a successful four-year spell, Carl Abbott resigned his position as manager in order to take the managerial position at &lt;a href=\"Hinckley%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hinckley&lt;/a&gt;. \nHe was replaced by former &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20Khalsa%20F.C.\"&gt;Sporting Khalsa&lt;/a&gt; manager Mark Holdcroft who guided the club to a 6th place finish in his first season in charge, and followed this up with a record 2nd place finish the following year with semi final losses in the &lt;a href=\"Staffordshire%20Senior%20Cup\"&gt;Staffordshire Senior Cup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20Senior%20Cup\"&gt;Walsall Senior Cup&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20Under-23s%20and%20Academy\"&gt;Stoke City F.C. Under-23s and Academy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20F.C.%20Youth%20and%20Reserves\"&gt;Walsall F.C. Youth and Reserves&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Mark Holdcroft was replaced the following season following a 9th place league finish, with former &lt;a href=\"Wednesfield%20F.C.\"&gt;Wednesfield F.C.&lt;/a&gt; manager Dean Gill taking over the reins.\nDean Gill narrowly missed out on promotion with a 3rd place finish in his first season in charge, winning the &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League\"&gt;West Midlands (Regional) League&lt;/a&gt; Premier Division Cup in the process. Following the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; outbreak, the 2019\u201320 season was halted with the \"Cassies\" in 4th place. Gill resigned to take over at &lt;a href=\"Bilston%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Bilston Town&lt;/a&gt;, which led the club to appoint Adam Pearce as manager. In 2021, under Pearce\u2019s tutelage, the club were promoted to the Premier Division of the &lt;a href=\"Midland%20Football%20League\"&gt;Midland League&lt;/a&gt; based on their results in the abandoned &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League\"&gt;2019\u201320&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League\"&gt;2020\u201321&lt;/a&gt; seasons.\nGround.\nBrinsford Lane boasts a clubhouse, a tearoom, and a small stand with bench seating for approximately 150 people.
