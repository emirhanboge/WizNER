Mason&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Home%20Depot\"&gt;Home Depot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Target%20Corporation\"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wal-Mart\"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walgreens\"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"W.%20W.%20Grainger\"&gt;Grainger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"McMaster-Carr\"&gt;McMaster-Carr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meijer\"&gt;Meijer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Meyer\"&gt;Fred Meyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"WH%20Smith\"&gt;WH Smith&lt;/a&gt;, and many other major chains.\nHistory.\nBefore 1960s.\nAcme United has roots dating back to 1867 when German immigrant Leo Renz bought an old grist mill in Naugatuck, Connecticut. He opened Renz Shear Shop and started the manufacture of &lt;a href=\"scissors\"&gt;scissors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cast%20iron\"&gt;cast iron&lt;/a&gt; shears. In 1873, Leo Renz, along with Robert and Mitchell Renz, and John Peck, officially incorporated their business as The Renz Shear Company.\nIn the 1880s the Company moved to &lt;a href=\"Bridgeport\"&gt;Bridgeport&lt;/a&gt;, Connecticut, where it was incorporated as The Acme Shear Company. A few years later, the company was sold to the brothers David C. Wheeler and Dwight Wheeler, who were responsible for its initial growth. Henry Wheeler, the grandson of David C. Wheeler, became president of Acme Shear in 1941 and again expanded the company in a number of directions. Aided by World War II, Acme Shear became the world's largest maker of shears and scissors by 1946.\n1960s and 1970s.\nAfter the second World War, Acme Shear established a &lt;a href=\"subsidiary\"&gt;subsidiary&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; to sell directly to the European market. It also introduced a line of disposable &lt;a href=\"Trauma%20shears\"&gt;medical scissors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"surgical%20instruments\"&gt;surgical instruments&lt;/a&gt; in 1965. This business became so successful that a new &lt;a href=\"Factory\"&gt;manufacturing plant&lt;/a&gt; in Fremont, North Carolina, had to be opened to meet demand. To mark its 100th anniversary, Acme Shear did an &lt;a href=\"initial%20public%20offering\"&gt;initial public offering&lt;/a&gt; (IPO) and as such became a publicly traded company in 1967.\nIn the 1970s, Acme acquired &lt;a href=\"Westcott%20Rule%20Company\"&gt;Westcott Rule Company&lt;/a&gt;, a major ruler manufacturer, which was founded in 1872 in &lt;a href=\"Seneca%20Falls%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Seneca Falls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. To better reflect the expanded product line, the company name was changed to Acme United Corporation. The 1970s were also highlighted by further expansion in the medical field, with several new acquisitions and products.\nAcme United acquired the Canadian business Acme Ruler &amp; Advertising Co out of Toronto, Ontario. This company was established in the 1890s and made rulers, blackboard triangles, protractors, etc. In 1980, the Canadian business\u2019s name was changed to Acme Ruler Company and in 1993 to its present name Acme United Limited. From this business unit, Acme United runs its entire Canadian operation.\n1980s.\nDespite continued growth during the 1960s and 1970s, Acme United faced rough times during the 1980s because it became too dependent on one medical tools customer, American Hospital Supply. When this company started manufacturing products itself, Acme lost over $20 million in annual sales. In a struggle to survive, it took over several companies in the US and abroad, however with varying success.\n1990s.\nDuring the early 1990s Acme United continued to suffer losses, which was reflected in the company\u2019s share price. The stock, which had been trading around $25 in the 1980s, now sold for only $3, leading to strong shareholder pressure to implement significant management changes.\nWalter C. Johnsen joined the company early 1995 as a Board member and became CEO later that same year. He had previously been vice chairman and a principal of Marshall Products, Inc., a medical supply distributor that he and a partner acquired in a leveraged buyout. Marshall had been purchased by &lt;a href=\"OMRON\"&gt;Omron Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, to become the North American arm of its medical business.\nIn the following years, Johnsen recruited a new management team, sold the medical business to Medical Action Industries and closed seven manufacturing plants. Brian Olschan joined as senior vice president of sales and marketing, and later became chief operating officer.\nBy focusing on higher margin products such as student scissors, rulers and staplers, Acme United returned to profitability in 2000 when it reported a net income of $1.1 million. Additionally, it penetrated the office market by selling products to mass merchants such as Wal-Mart and Target.\n2000s.\nWith financial results again improving, Acme United acquired &lt;a href=\"Clauss%20Cutlery%20Company\"&gt;Clauss Cutlery&lt;/a&gt; from Alco Industries in June 2004. Clauss, founded in 1877 in &lt;a href=\"Fremont%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Fremont, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, manufactured scissors and cutting tools for the &lt;a href=\"Floral%20industry\"&gt;floral&lt;/a&gt; and industrial markets. By 2004, Acme United\u2019s sales had risen to $43.4 million with earnings reaching $3.2 million.\nIn 2007, the company bought the brand names and intellectual property of &lt;a href=\"Camillus%20Cutlery%20Company\"&gt;Camillus Cutlery Company&lt;/a&gt;, one of the oldest knife manufacturers in the United States, for $200,000 in a bankruptcy auction.\nIn February 2011, Acme United acquired Pac-Kit Safety Equipment Company, a manufacturer of first aid kits for the industrial, safety, transportation and marine markets. The company purchased the &lt;a href=\"accounts%20receivable\"&gt;accounts receivable&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, equipment, brands, historical records, and photographs for $3.4 million. Pac-Kit\u2019s revenues in 2010 were approximately $5.4 million.\nAnd Acme United continued on its acquisition path. In June 2012, it acquired certain assets of &lt;a href=\"C-Thru%20Ruler\"&gt;The C-Thru Ruler Company&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known supplier of drafting, measuring, lettering and stencil products. Acme United purchased the inventory, tooling, brands, and other intellectual property for approximately $1.47 million. In 2011, C-Thru\u2019s revenues were about $2.5 million with gross profits reaching roughly $1 million. After Acme United acquired C-Thru Ruler Company in 2012, its products were integrated into the Westcott products family. So, the identity of C-Thru in many cases has become Westcott.\nLate August 2013, Acme United purchased a 340,000 square feet manufacturing and distribution center in &lt;a href=\"Rocky%20Mount%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Rocky Mount, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, for $2.8 million. Before that, the Company had two distribution centers, which, combined, were only half the size of the new one. The lease for one warehouse was terminated, and the second warehouse, in Fremont, North Carolina, was sold by Acme on April 7, 2014, for $850,000.\nBecause Acme United\u2019s first aid business showed strong growth in the industrial safety market and office channel, it acquired &lt;a href=\"First%20Aid%20Only\"&gt;First Aid Only Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a supplier of first aid kits, refills, and safety products for $13.8 million in June 2014. In 2013, First Aid Only reached revenues of $17.4 million and operating income of $1.1 million.\nAlso in 2014, Acme United launched an entire line of fishing knives and tools under the new brand Cuda. About 30 tools, specifically designed for inshore and offshore fishing, were introduced at the International Convention of Allied Sportfishing Trades (ICAST), the largest sportfishing trade show in the world. At ICAST 2015, twenty additional tools for freshwater fishing were shown to the public for the first time. The market for freshwater tools is more than double the size of the salt water market.\nIn 2014 Acme United achieved record net sales and earnings. For the first time in the Company\u2019s history, annual sales reached more than $100 million.\nOn February 1, 2016, Acme United acquired Diamond Machining Technology (DMT), a Marlborough, Massachusetts-based manufacturer of sharpening tools for knives, scissors, chisels and other cutting tools. Acme United paid $7.0 million in cash. DMT had revenues in 2015 of $5.4 million and EBITDA of approximately $1.0 million.\nExactly one year later, Acme United acquired Spill Magic Inc. for $7.2 million in cash. Spill Magic is a manufacturer of Spill Magic absorbents and related products that are used to prevent slip &amp; fall accidents. Spill Magic had revenues in 2016 of $6.3 million and EBITDA of approximately $1.4 million.\nOn January 7, 2020, the Company purchased the assets of First Aid Central, located in Laval, Quebec, Canada. First Aid Central produces and sells a complete line of first aid kits, refills, and safety products to a broad range of industries and end users. Its products meet federal Health Canada and provincial regulatory requirements. The Company purchased the First Aid Central assets for $2.1 million in cash.\nIn December of 2020, Acme United also acquired the assets of Med-Nap LLC., a Brooksville, Florida based manufacturer of alcohol prep pads, alcohol wipes, benzalkonium chloride wipes, antiseptic wipes, and other first aid products. Med-Nap has an FDA-registered manufacturing facility where it produces all of its products.\nCorporate structure.\nToday, Acme United has ten main brands: Westcott, Clauss, PhysiciansCare, Pac-Kit, Camillus, First Aid Only, Med-Nap, Cuda, DMT and Spill Magic.\nWestcott.\n&lt;a href=\"Westcott%20scissors%20and%20rulers\"&gt;Westcott&lt;/a&gt; is a major brand for scissors and rulers in North America, and one of the strongest worldwide. Their scissors range from kids and student products to sewing, office, and craft items. Their rulers come in &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plastic\"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stainless%20steel\"&gt;stainless steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Acrylic%20glass\"&gt;acrylic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt; with plentiful designs, innovations and fashionable colors. Each year, Acme sells between 60 and 80 million scissors, and 15 to 18 million Westcott rulers.\nFollowing the success in scissors and rulers, Westcott extended its product line with other office tools such as &lt;a href=\"Paper%20cutter\"&gt;paper trimmers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pencil%20sharpeners\"&gt;pencil sharpeners&lt;/a&gt;, math kits, etc.\nClauss.\n&lt;a href=\"Clauss%20Cutlery%20Company\"&gt;Clauss&lt;/a&gt; primarily manufactures cutting instruments for professionals in the hardware &amp; industrial, lawn &amp; garden, food processing, sewing and housewares markets. These products include True Professional sewing shears, &lt;a href=\"Utility%20knife\"&gt;utility knives&lt;/a&gt;, chef shears, hobby knives and craft implements. Also, in 2013 Clauss launched a family of titanium bonded non-stick putty knives.\nPhysiciansCare.\nPhysiciansCare offers a broad assortment of &lt;a href=\"first%20aid%20kit\"&gt;first aid kit&lt;/a&gt;s, emergency and disaster kits, preparedness products and kit refills. PhysiciansCare also carries a branded line of over-the-counter &lt;a href=\"medicines\"&gt;medicines&lt;/a&gt;, including the ingredients aspirin, acetaminophen and Ibuprofen.\nPac-Kit.\n&lt;a href=\"Pac-Kit%20First%20Aid%20Kits\"&gt;Pac-Kit&lt;/a&gt; sells first aid kits, industrial stations and refills, emergency medical travel and recreational kits to the industrial, safety, transportation and marine markets. The brands has roots dating back to the 1800s as part of the &lt;a href=\"GlaxoSmithKline\"&gt;Burroughs Wellcome Company&lt;/a&gt;. It was one of the first companies that began packaging medications and dressings into cases for use in the field. Many explorers of that time carried the cases with them on their expeditions. &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Falcon%20Scott\"&gt;Captain Robert Scott&lt;/a&gt; used it on his expedition to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Pole\"&gt;South Pole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Evelyn%20Byrd\"&gt;Admiral Byrd&lt;/a&gt; carried them on the first flight to the South Pole, &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Peary\"&gt;Admiral Peary&lt;/a&gt; brought Pac-Kit first aid kits on both his &lt;a href=\"North%20Pole\"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt; and South Pole flights and &lt;a href=\"Nobel%20Prize\"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href=\"Fridtjof%20Nansen\"&gt;Fridtjof Nansen&lt;/a&gt; had a Pac-Kit on his polar expeditions.\nCamillus.\n&lt;a href=\"Camillus%20Cutlery%20Company\"&gt;Camillus&lt;/a&gt;, with roots dating back to 1876, is one of the best known brands in the knife industry.

The new Camillus knives have well designed, durable handles and the blades have a &lt;a href=\"titanium\"&gt;titanium&lt;/a&gt; carbonitride &lt;a href=\"coating\"&gt;coating&lt;/a&gt;, making them 10 times harder than stainless steel. The knives are sold at leading retailers and specialty knife shops.\nIn 2013, Camillus also re-launched its knives in Europe and soon attracted distributors for Scandinavian and German speaking countries. Meanwhile, Camillus is being distributed in twelve European countries.\nFirst Aid Only.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Aid%20Only\"&gt;First Aid Only&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1988 and pioneered consultative selling and support of first aid items to large corporate customers.\nIt operates out of a modern 54,000 square-foot facility in Vancouver, Washington, where well over 100 people are employed.

After much testing and development work, a prototype sharpener was developed, which the engineers at DMT then refined to an unbreakable, clean-cutting diamond &lt;a href=\"Honing%20%28metalworking%29\"&gt;honing tool&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first polka dot diamond bench stones were soon thereafter shipped to customers such as &lt;a href=\"Brookstone\"&gt;Brookstone&lt;/a&gt; for use in the woodworking area and &lt;a href=\"Bloomingdale%27s\"&gt;Bloomingdale's&lt;/a&gt; for use in the kitchen. The new sharpener quickly found its way to other sectors as well, such as the automotive, marine, and aviation industries.\nToday, DMT products are sold in dozens of countries all over the world. In addition, the company holds more than ten patents and has introduced over 125 different products. It sells many tens of thousands of items each year to DIYers, gardening and outdoor enthusiasts, woodworkers, hunters, fishermen, and military and law enforcement personnel.\nSpill Magic.\nSpill Magic, Inc. was founded by David Wampler in March 1995.
