    "text": "C\u00e1ceres is one of the two constituencies () represented in the &lt;a href=\"Assembly%20of%20Extremadura\"&gt;Assembly of Extremadura&lt;/a&gt;, the regional legislature of the &lt;a href=\"Extremadura\"&gt;Autonomous Community of Extremadura&lt;/a&gt;. The constituency currently elects 29 &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20%28legislator%29\"&gt;deputies&lt;/a&gt;. Its boundaries correspond to those of the Spanish &lt;a href=\"province%20of%20C%C3%A1ceres\"&gt;province of C\u00e1ceres&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"electoral%20system\"&gt;electoral system&lt;/a&gt; uses the &lt;a href=\"D%27Hondt%20method\"&gt;D'Hondt method&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Closed%20list\"&gt;closed-list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;, with a minimum threshold of five percent.\nElectoral system.\nThe constituency was created as per the &lt;a href=\"Statute%20of%20Autonomy\"&gt;Statute of Autonomy of Extremadura of 1983&lt;/a&gt; and was first contested in the &lt;a href=\"1983%20Extremaduran%20regional%20election\"&gt;1983 regional election&lt;/a&gt;. The Statute provided for the two &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Spain\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Extremadura\"&gt;Extremadura&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20Badajoz\"&gt;Badajoz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Province%20of%20C%C3%A1ceres\"&gt;C\u00e1ceres&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to be established as multi-member districts in the &lt;a href=\"Assembly%20of%20Extremadura\"&gt;Assembly of Extremadura&lt;/a&gt;, with this regulation being maintained under the 1987 regional electoral law. Each constituency is entitled to an initial minimum of 20 seats, with the remaining 25 being distributed in proportion to their populations. The exception was the 1983 election, when each constituency was allocated a fixed number of seats: 35 for Badajoz and 30 for C\u00e1ceres.\nVoting is on the basis of &lt;a href=\"universal%20suffrage\"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt;, which comprises all nationals over eighteen, registered in Extremadura and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Amendments to the electoral law in 2011 required for &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20diaspora\"&gt;Extremadurans abroad&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Voter%20registration\"&gt;apply for voting&lt;/a&gt; before being permitted to vote, a system known as \"begged\" or expat vote (). Seats are elected using the &lt;a href=\"D%27Hondt%20method\"&gt;D'Hondt method&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"closed%20list\"&gt;closed list&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;, with an &lt;a href=\"electoral%20threshold\"&gt;electoral threshold&lt;/a&gt; of five percent of valid votes\u2014which includes blank ballots\u2014being applied in each constituency. Alternatively, parties failing to reach the threshold in one of the constituencies are also entitled to enter the seat distribution as long as they run candidates in both districts and reach five percent regionally.\nThe electoral law allows for &lt;a href=\"Political%20party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Political%20alliance\"&gt;federations&lt;/a&gt; registered in the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;interior ministry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20alliance\"&gt;coalitions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grouping%20of%20electors%20%28Spain%29\"&gt;groupings of electors&lt;/a&gt; to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call\u2014fifteen before 1985\u2014whereas groupings of electors need to secure the signature of at least two percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they seek election\u2014one-thousandth of the electorate, with a compulsory minimum of 500 signatures, until 1985\u2014disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates."
