    "text": "Defeated Sanity is a German &lt;a href=\"technical%20death%20metal\"&gt;technical death metal&lt;/a&gt; band from &lt;a href=\"Dachsbach\"&gt;Dachsbach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; that was conceived in 1993 by guitarist Wolfgang Teske and his son, drummer Lille Gruber. The group's lineup currently consists of Gruber (drums), Josh Welshman (vocals), and Jacob Schmidt (bass guitar). The band is known for their very brutal, abrasive and intricate style of &lt;a href=\"death%20metal\"&gt;death metal&lt;/a&gt;, while at the same time maintaining almost &lt;a href=\"jazz%20fusion\"&gt;jazz fusion&lt;/a&gt; style influences. Defeated Sanity's genre has also sometimes been categorized as progressive death metal.\nTo date the band has released six studio albums: \"Prelude to the Tragedy\"\u00a0(Grindethic Records, 2004), \"Psalms of the Moribund\"\u00a0(Grindethic, 2007), \"Chapters of Repugnance\"\u00a0(Willowtip Records, 2010), \"Passages into Deformity\"\u00a0(Willowtip, 2013), \"Disposal of the Dead / Dharmata\"\u00a0(Willowtip, 2016), and \"The Sanguinary Impetus\" (Willowtip, 2020). The group also released numerous &lt;a href=\"Promotional%20recording\"&gt;promos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demo%20%28music%29\"&gt;demos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"split%20album\"&gt;splits&lt;/a&gt;. Influenced by bands such as &lt;a href=\"Cannibal%20Corpse\"&gt;Cannibal Corpse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Suffocation%20%28band%29\"&gt;Suffocation&lt;/a&gt;, their music style is mostly inspired by American extreme metal.\nHistory.\nDefeated Sanity was formed in Dachsbach, Germany in 1993 by guitarist Wolfgang Teske and drummer Lille Gruber, initially as a &lt;a href=\"side%20project\"&gt;side project&lt;/a&gt;. In 1996, bassist Jonas Gruber and vocalist Robert Colnik joined the band as &lt;a href=\"session%20musician\"&gt;session musician&lt;/a&gt;s. This line-up recorded the first two demos, \"Devoured by the Black\" in the same year, followed by \"Withdrawn from Beauty\" in 1998. After undergoing a line-up change, Defeated Sanity eventually recruited guitarist &lt;a href=\"Christian%20M%C3%BCenzner\"&gt;Christian M\u00fcenzner&lt;/a&gt; and bassist Tino K\u00f6hler. Colnik departed the band shortly after recording a demo in 2000. He was replaced by Markus Keller, who re-recorded a track from the demo; the track was included on the &lt;a href=\"split%20album\"&gt;split&lt;/a&gt; with Poppy Seed Grinder, released through the Czech label Grodhaisn in 2001. Later that year, M\u00fcnzner left the band to join &lt;a href=\"Necrophagist\"&gt;Necrophagist&lt;/a&gt;. Defeated Sanity released a &lt;a href=\"7-inch\"&gt;7-inch&lt;/a&gt; split EP with Brazilian death metal band &lt;a href=\"Imperious%20Malevolence\"&gt;Imperious Malevolence&lt;/a&gt; through Merciless Records in 2003.\n\"Prelude to the Tragedy\".\nIn 2004, Defeated Sanity signed with UK label Grindethic Records to release their full-length debut. The album was recorded at Soundforge Studios in &lt;a href=\"Rhauderfehn\"&gt;Rhauderfehn&lt;/a&gt;, Germany. The band produced the record and Andreas Hilbert handled the engineering and mastering. \"Prelude to the Tragedy\" was released in November that same year. The album received mixed reviews. \"Diabolical Conquest\" said, \"\"Prelude to the Tragedy\" is a gleaming chrome harpoon of immaculate &lt;a href=\"technical%20death%20metal\"&gt;technical death metal&lt;/a&gt;, deftly interweaving cryptic riff-tangles with convolutional percussive violence to surprisingly comprehensible and utterly enjoyable results. Drum work, relentless in its complexity, enhances both the progressive and barbaric elements of the tracks, nailing ambitious patterns to them with satisfying snare punch, lucid cymbals and expert fills.\" Negative criticism of the album was mostly about the higher technical style of their music. \"Lords of Metal\" said, \"This is only interesting for the real die-hard trash (not thrash!) lovers, and mathematicians, of course.\" To promote the album, the band toured during 2005, appearing at Rotterdam Deathfest (an &lt;a href=\"extreme%20metal\"&gt;extreme metal&lt;/a&gt; festival in The Netherlands), along with bands such as &lt;a href=\"Suffocation%20%28band%29\"&gt;Suffocation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Visceral%20Bleeding\"&gt;Visceral Bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, and Vomit Remnants.\n\"Psalms of the Moribund\" and \"Chapters of Repugnance\".\nDefeated Sanity underwent further line-up changes with Jens Staschel joining on vocals, Christian Kuehn on guitar and Jacob Schmidt filling in on bass. In August 2006, the band recorded their second studio album at Soundlodge Studios. It was produced and engineered by J\u00f6rg Ukenand, and mastered by Robbert Kok of &lt;a href=\"Disavowed\"&gt;Disavowed&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, Gruber played drums for Austrian &lt;a href=\"blackened%20death%20metal\"&gt;blackened death metal&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href=\"Belphegor%20%28band%29\"&gt;Belphegor&lt;/a&gt; on their North American tour with &lt;a href=\"Unleashed%20%28band%29\"&gt;Unleashed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krisiun\"&gt;Krisiun&lt;/a&gt;. \"Psalms of the Moribund\" was released through Grindethic Records in March 2007. Like its predecessor, the album received mixed reviews, with Erik Thomas of webzine Teeth of the Divine saying, \"With ultra-deep, almost &lt;a href=\"grindcore\"&gt;grindcore&lt;/a&gt; styled burps layered over complex yet savage riffs, Defeated Sanity, unlike some of their US peers, do manage to throw in some nice grooves and lurches amid the blasting carnage, hence the &lt;a href=\"Suffocation%20%28band%29\"&gt;Suffocation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Devourment\"&gt;Devourment&lt;/a&gt; comparisons, but otherwise, \"Psalms of the Moribund\" is a pretty breakneck assault of squealing, pinch harmonics and ravenous &lt;a href=\"blast%20beat\"&gt;blast beat&lt;/a&gt;s.\" &lt;a href=\"Chronicles%20of%20Chaos%20%28webzine%29\"&gt;Chronicles of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; reviewer Kostas Sarampalis criticized the vocal style of Jens Staschel, stating, \"The constant low guttural growling is completely unintelligible, used more like a (very blunt) instrument rather than a means to convey lyrics.\"\nThe band played at &lt;a href=\"Maryland%20Deathfest\"&gt;Maryland Deathfest&lt;/a&gt; at the Sonar in &lt;a href=\"Baltimore\"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; in May 2008, along with &lt;a href=\"Anaal%20Nathrakh\"&gt;Anaal Nathrakh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Monstrosity%20%28band%29\"&gt;Monstrosity&lt;/a&gt;. In July 2008, two members left Defeated Sanity: first Staschel, and Teske shortly afterward. After searching for a new vocalist for almost a year, Defeated Sanity brought in vocalist A.J. Magana from &lt;a href=\"Disgorge%20%28American%20band%29\"&gt;Disgorge&lt;/a&gt;, who recorded the vocals on the band's third full-length album, \"Chapters of Repugnance\", released through Willowtip Records on 4 May 2010. The album was recorded at Soundforge Studios in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;. According to Cosmo Lee of \"&lt;a href=\"Decibel%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Decibel&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine, \"Chapters of Repugnance\" is the first album cover on Willowtip that the printer has refused to print. \"It's a so-bad-it's-good &lt;a href=\"Hieronymus%20Bosch\"&gt;Hieronymus Bosch&lt;/a&gt;-esque depiction of hell in which everyone is nude and bald.\" Beginning in late 2015, Defeated Sanity embarked on a headline U.S. tour, performing their first concert shows in the United States since 2008.\n\"Disposal of the Dead\" / \"Dharmata\".\nBefore the summer of 2016, Defeated Sanity confirmed work on a new release, which is a two part full-length album with one side titled \"Disposal of the Dead\" and the other titled \"Dharmata\". These two parts represent two EPs compiled onto a full-length, with each part carrying a sound unique to it; \"Disposal of the Dead\" aimed to represent the more primal side of the band's sound, while \"Dharmata\" was a direct homage to the old school progressive death metal style of bands such as &lt;a href=\"Atheist%20%28band%29\"&gt;Atheist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cynic%20%28band%29\"&gt;Cynic&lt;/a&gt;. \"Dharmata\" prominently features vocals from Max Phelps of Baltimore progressive death metal band Exist, and formerly Cynic as well as &lt;a href=\"Death%20%28metal%20band%29\"&gt;Death DTA&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn late 2016, the band recruited American vocalist Josh Welshman replacing L\u00fchring who departed the following year. Prior to him officially joining, Welshman provided vocals on the band's two US tours, the Obscene Extreme festival as well as other shows in Europe and Indonesia. In 2018, the band participated in the lineup for the American death metal festival Las Vegas Death Fest.\n\"The Sanguinary Impetus\".\nIn May 2020, Defeated Sanity announced that their sixth album would be titled \"The Sanguinary Impetus\", and would be slated for a July release. Following the departure of K\u00fchn, Gruber performed all guitars on the album in addition to his regular drum duties. \"Metal Injection\" called \"The Sanguinary Impetus\" \"freakishly chaotic, frequently unnerving, and stupefyingly complex.\"\nStyle and influences.\nAlthough the band is of German origin, their music is based on the American style of &lt;a href=\"death%20metal\"&gt;death metal&lt;/a&gt;. Drummer Lille Gruber explained, \"&lt;a href=\"Blues\"&gt;Blues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rock%20music\"&gt;rock music&lt;/a&gt; was developed in the U.S., that means it all goes back to this country. The roots are there and I think the best musicians will always be there.\" When asked about the difference in terms of sound and direction between \"Psalms of the Moribund\" and \"Prelude to the Tragedy\", Gruber stated, \"We got our own style on \"Psalms to the Moribund\" where \"Prelude to the Tragedy\" had very obvious hints of the bands we idolized. \"Psalms of the Moribund\" splits into two extremes, it went more chunky, brutal, thick and deep, but at the same time that math-approach and the technicality went up a lot!\"\nDefeated Sanity's main influences are the early work of &lt;a href=\"Cannibal%20Corpse\"&gt;Cannibal Corpse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Immolation%20%28band%29\"&gt;Immolation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Suffocation%20%28band%29\"&gt;Suffocation&lt;/a&gt;. Gruber also cited newer bands like &lt;a href=\"Disgorge%20%28American%20band%29\"&gt;Disgorge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Devourment\"&gt;Devourment&lt;/a&gt; as a source of inspiration. Defeated Sanity's lyrics are influenced by the Tennessee band &lt;a href=\"Brodequin%20%28band%29\"&gt;Brodequin&lt;/a&gt;. Gruber described Brodequin\u2019s lyrics as \"dark and brutal\", which fit with Defeated Sanity's &lt;a href=\"Graphic%20violence\"&gt;gore&lt;/a&gt; imagery and said that it\u2019s an \u201cawesome concept\u201d.\nOn Defeated Sanity's 2016 album \"Disposal of the Dead / Dharmata\", the group perform two separate styles on the two EP-length halves of the album, with the band describing it as \"a &lt;a href=\"split%20album\"&gt;split&lt;/a&gt; with ourselves\". \"Disposal of the Dead\" features their signature brutal and technical style while \"Dharmata\" is \"an homage to old school &lt;a href=\"progressive%20death%20metal\"&gt;progressive death metal&lt;/a&gt;\" reminiscent of bands such as &lt;a href=\"Death%20%28metal%20band%29\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; and early &lt;a href=\"Pestilence%20%28band%29\"&gt;Pestilence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jazz%20music\"&gt;Jazz&lt;/a&gt; influence is prevalent as well."
