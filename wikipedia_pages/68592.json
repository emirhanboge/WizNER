    "text": "Adummim () is a place-name mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20Bible\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Joshua\"&gt;Book of Joshua&lt;/a&gt; in connection with the ascent of Adummim.\nLocation.\nAdummim was apparently on the road between &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jericho\"&gt;Jericho&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Judaean%20desert\"&gt;Judaean desert&lt;/a&gt;, today in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Bank\"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;. It is mentioned in the Book of Joshua (, ) as being \"on the south side of the stream\", which Matthew Easton (1897) identified with &lt;a href=\"Wadi%20Kelt\"&gt;Wadi Kelt&lt;/a&gt;, and across from &lt;a href=\"Gilgal\"&gt;Gilgal&lt;/a&gt; or/and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20minor%20biblical%20places%23Geliloth\"&gt;Geliloth&lt;/a&gt;. Easton claimed that it was nearly halfway between &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jericho\"&gt;Jericho&lt;/a&gt;, and now bears the name of Tal'at ed-Dumm. More recently, Pekka Pitk\u00e4nen (2010) has stated that \"The location of Adummim is unclear.\"\nThe \"ascent of Adummim\" is a very important historical road that leads up from Jericho towards Jerusalem, following the top of a ridge that forms the southern bank of Wadi Qelt and separates it from Wadi Tal'at ad-Damm.\nName.\nThe name Adummim is related to \"adom\", the Hebrew word for \"red\", and can be translated as \"red places\", which may refer to the reddish streaks found in the stone of the area. The red-brown hills of the area on the road descending from Jerusalem to Jericho are made of iron-oxide-tinged &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;. The Ascent of Adummim was known as the \"Ascent of Blood\" by the Crusaders.\nSources outside the Bible.\nThe name is attested in the &lt;a href=\"Annals%20of%20Thutmose%20III\"&gt;Annals of Thutmose III&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Karnak\"&gt;Temple of Karnak&lt;/a&gt; as Atamem, which &lt;a href=\"Auguste%20Mariette\"&gt;Mariette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emmanuel%20de%20Roug%C3%A9\"&gt;Roug\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gaston%20Maspero\"&gt;Maspero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Max%20M%C3%BCller\"&gt;M\u00fcller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20Borchardt\"&gt;Borchardt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wallis%20Budge\"&gt;Budge&lt;/a&gt; identify with the biblical Adummim.\nIn Christianity.\nIt is supposed to have been the place referred to in the parable of the &lt;a href=\"Good%20Samaritan\"&gt;Good Samaritan&lt;/a&gt;. The so-called &lt;a href=\"Inn%20of%20the%20Good%20Samaritan\"&gt;Inn of the Good Samaritan&lt;/a&gt; has been named based on this assumption.\nArchaeological sites.\nSt George's Monastery (Wadi Qelt).\nA lavra established in the 420s in &lt;a href=\"Wadi%20Qelt\"&gt;Wadi Qelt&lt;/a&gt; and reorganised as a monastery around the year 500 became known as &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20of%20Saints%20John%20and%20George%20of%20Choziba\"&gt;St George's Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Rebuilt since the 19th century, it hangs spectacularly from the cliffs on the south side of the wadi, across from the ridge rising from the Plain of Jericho towards Jerusalem and known as the \"ascent of Adummim\".\nInn of the Good Samaritan (Khan al-Hatruri).\nAnother khan built along the Ascent of Adummim, the Good Samaritan Inn, known in Arabic both as Khan al-Hatruri, and sometimes, quite confusingly (see the other khan mentioned above), as Khan al-Ahmar, stands east of the Highway 1-&lt;a href=\"Route%20417%20%28Israel%E2%80%93Palestine%29\"&gt;Route 417&lt;/a&gt; junction. &lt;a href=\"Eusebius\"&gt;Eusebius&lt;/a&gt; mentions the Late Roman fort of Maledomni, whose traces have disappeared under the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20Templar\"&gt;Templar&lt;/a&gt; castle of Maldoim (see below). Under the protection of the fortified place, a caravanserai was established. In its present shape it was built in 1903.\nIn the Early Byzantine period, there seems to have been a fortress at the site (4th-5th century), replaced in the 6th century by a square-shaped hostel, erected around a central courtyard, providing Christian pilgrims with rooms, water from a central cistern, and a large church for worship.\nThe recently restored complex holds a museum of mosaics excavated by Israeli archaeologists in the Palestinian areas, and a wing dedicated to the history and customs of the &lt;a href=\"Samaritans\"&gt;Samaritans&lt;/a&gt;.\nTemplar castle of Maldoim.\nAcross the &lt;a href=\"Highway%201%20%28Israel%29\"&gt;modern highway&lt;/a&gt; from the Inn of the Good Samaritan/Khan al-Hatruri, are the archaeological remains of a medieval castle known to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; as Maldoim, Adumim, or Rouge Cisterne / Cisterna Rubea (Red Cistern), among other names. In Arabic it is known as Qal'at ad-Damm, \"Blood Castle\". It was built by the &lt;a href=\"Templars\"&gt;Templars&lt;/a&gt; before 1169/72, probably at the site of a Late Roman fort, to protect the road between Jerusalem and Jericho. It stands at the top of the \"Ascent of Blood\", as the Ascent of Adummim was known to the Crusaders.\nMonastery of St Euthymius (Khan al-Ahmar).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Byzantine\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Laura%20of%20Euthymius\"&gt;Monastery of St. Euthymius&lt;/a&gt;, founded at first as a &lt;a href=\"lavra\"&gt;lavra&lt;/a&gt;-type monastic community by Saint &lt;a href=\"Euthymius%20the%20Great\"&gt;Euthymius the Great&lt;/a&gt; in 420 along the Ascent of Adummim, played a major role in the development of desert monasticism in Palestine, and in the spread of &lt;a href=\"Chalcedonian%20creed\"&gt;Chalcedonian&lt;/a&gt; orthodoxy in the country after the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Chalcedon\"&gt;451 Church Council&lt;/a&gt;. Fallen into ruin, it was rebuilt in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Crusader period&lt;/a&gt;, only to be abandoned again after its destruction at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Mamluk%20Egypt\"&gt;Mamluk period&lt;/a&gt; in the 13th century by Sultan &lt;a href=\"Baybars\"&gt;Baybars&lt;/a&gt;. The structure was repurposed as a &lt;a href=\"caravanserai\"&gt;caravanserai&lt;/a&gt; or \"&lt;a href=\"Khan%20%28inn%29\"&gt;hhan&lt;/a&gt;\" for Muslim pilgrims travelling from Jerusalem to Mecca via the nearby shrine of &lt;a href=\"Nabi%20Musa\"&gt;Nabi Musa&lt;/a&gt;, and became known as Khan al-Ahmar, the \"Red &lt;a href=\"Khan%20%28inn%29\"&gt;Khan&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMonastery of Martyrius.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20of%20Martyrius\"&gt;Monastery of Martyrius&lt;/a&gt; (5th\u20137th century), excavated in the centre of Ma'ale Adummim at a site known in Arabic as Khirbet el-Murassas, was an important Byzantine centre of monastic life in the &lt;a href=\"Judaean%20desert\"&gt;Judaean desert&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther places in the area.\nThe area is accessible via Israel &lt;a href=\"Highway%201%20%28Israel%29\"&gt;Highway 1&lt;/a&gt;."
