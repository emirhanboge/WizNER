Athletics records comprise the best performance of an athlete before the year of their 20th birthday. Technically, in all under 20 age divisions, the age is calculated \"on December 31 of the year of competition\" to avoid age group switching during a competitive season.

All bests shown on the indoor list are tracked by statisticians not officially sanctioned by the governing body. \nOutdoor.\nKey to tables:\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"
