It has been likened to a &lt;a href=\"three-dimensional%20space\"&gt;three-dimensional&lt;/a&gt; game on a &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;two-dimensional&lt;/a&gt; board.\nThe game was designed by Martin H. Samuel and first printed, as \"Excel\", by &lt;a href=\"American%20Airlines\"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"inflight%20magazine\"&gt;inflight magazine&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Way%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;American Way&lt;/a&gt;\", on December 24, 1985 and July 22, 1986. It has been sold commercially as \"Eclipse\" in 1994, and \"Hijara\" (the &lt;a href=\"Arabic%20language\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; word for small stones) in 1995, 2003 and 2006.\n\"Hijara II\" is a 50-page &lt;a href=\"note%20pad\"&gt;note pad&lt;/a&gt; travel version played with a blue and a yellow pen.\nObjective.\nThe goal of the game is, to score the most points by placing your small stones on the board - building and/or blocking point-scoring combinations.\nGameplay.\nThe original commercial edition of Hijara has a game board of 16 squares, divided into 4 sections numbered 1 through 4 and a score-keeping \"&lt;a href=\"game%20ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;\" on either end.\nPlayers choose either yellow or blue and use 32 same-color stones plus one score-keeper each. Blue starts and players take turns placing their stones, one at a time, on any square, building on those already on the board, to complete and block point-scoring combinations. When a player places a stone on a square, it must be placed in the lowest-numbered open section in that square. So, for every square, the first small stone must be placed on the 1, second on the 2, etc.\nThe game starts with an empty board, and ends with a full board with 3 ways to score points when placement of four same-color stones is completed in any of the following combinations:\nPoints are won with a player's own-color stones and are always accrued, never deducted. Several point-scoring combinations may be completed at one time with a single stone. Overlooked points are forfeited and, throughout the game, players keep score on their side of the board with an extra stone of their color.\nThe game is over when the last small stone is placed and all the numbers are covered then, by comparing accrued points totals, the player with the greater number of points is the winner of the game.\nReferences.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/824/hijara\"&gt;BoardGameGeek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.connexxion24.com/Boardgames/Giseh-Games/Hijara-%25238211%253B-merciless-pleasure-in-combinations%3A%3A471.html\"&gt;Connexxion24&lt;/a&gt;"
