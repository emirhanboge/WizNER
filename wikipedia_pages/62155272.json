    "text": " is one of the two &lt;a href=\"state%20guest%20house\"&gt;state guest house&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Government of Japan&lt;/a&gt;. The other state guesthouse is the &lt;a href=\"Akasaka%20Palace\"&gt;Akasaka Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Edo%20period\"&gt;Edo period&lt;/a&gt; (1603 \u2013 1868) a Garden House and multiple mansions of aristocrats stood in the northeastern part such as of the Yanagihara family and Kushige family. The &lt;a href=\"Kyoto%20Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Kyoto Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; is in the northern part of Ky\u014dto-Gyoen National Garden (\u4eac\u90fd\u5fa1\u82d1). It was constructed in 1331 and the Emperors lived there until 1869. There are also &lt;a href=\"Sent%C5%8D%20Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Sent\u014d Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; gardens.\nIn 1994, to commemorate the twelve-hundredth (1200th) anniversary of the establishment of the ancient capital of &lt;a href=\"Heian-ky%C5%8D\"&gt;Heian-ky\u014d&lt;/a&gt; (\u5e73\u5b89\u4eac), there was growing momentum toward building a Japanese-style guest house in &lt;a href=\"Kyoto\"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;. In October 1994, approval was obtained from the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Cabinet of Japan&lt;/a&gt; for \"the construction of a guest house facility.\" The government decided to build a state guest house within the &lt;a href=\"Kyoto%20Gyoen%20National%20Garden\"&gt;Kyoto Gyoen National Garden&lt;/a&gt; (\u4eac\u90fd\u5fa1\u82d1). In March 2002, construction of the Kyoto State Guest House (main structure) started. Construction completed in February 2005 and the Kyoto State Guest House was opened on 17 April 2005. The total floor space of the new facility is 16,000 m\u00b2 and the lot is 20,140 m\u00b2. Since July 2016 the Kyoto State Guest House's all-year public opening started. It was designed by &lt;a href=\"Nikken%20Sekkei\"&gt;Nikken Sekkei&lt;/a&gt;. The Western-style of the Akasaka State Guest House contrasts with the Japanese-style buildings of the Kyoto State Guest House.\nThe first state guest after the opening of the Kyoto State Guest House was &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Minh%20Tri%E1%BA%BFt\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Minh Tri\u1ebft&lt;/a&gt;, former President of Vietnam (stayed 28\u201329 November 2007).\nJapanese garden.\nIt consists of the \u201ctrue garden\u201d (\u771f\u306e\u5ead) in front of the entrance, the central \"row garden\" (\u884c\u306e\u5ead) in the hall, and the \"grass garden\" (\u8349\u306e\u5ead) facing the guest room. A modern Japanese-style garden of \"Ichiya Niwaya\" was created by Kyoto gardeners with Sano T\u014demon (\u4f50\u91ce \u85e4\u53f3\u885b\u9580) as a masterpiece under the supervision of Hiromasa Amagasaki (\u5c3c\u5d0e \u535a\u6b63)."
