After winning the &lt;a href=\"Travers%20Stakes\"&gt;Travers Stakes&lt;/a&gt;, his handlers and &lt;a href=\"James%20R.%20Keene\"&gt;James R. Keene&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Domino, agreed to a match race in which the horses ended up in a &lt;a href=\"Tie%20%28draw%29\"&gt;dead heat&lt;/a&gt;. As such, they met again three weeks later in a race to determine the 1894 championship. For this championship event, the 4-year-old &lt;a href=\"Clifford%20%28horse%29\"&gt;Clifford&lt;/a&gt; joined the two younger colts. Henry of Navarre beat his rivals by 3/4 length, earning Horse of the Year honors.\nIn 1895 McLelland offered to match Henry of Navarre against any horse in the world over one mile for any sum from $5,000 to $25,000 at &lt;a href=\"weight-for-age\"&gt;weight-for-age&lt;/a&gt;.\nSold later in 1895 to prominent horseman &lt;a href=\"August%20Belmont%20Jr.\"&gt;August Belmont Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, Henry of Navarre repeated as the U.S. Champion under future Hall of Fame trainer &lt;a href=\"John%20Hyland%20%28horse%20trainer%29\"&gt;John Hyland&lt;/a&gt;.
