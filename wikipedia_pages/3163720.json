He is the tenth and current &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;Archbishop of New York&lt;/a&gt;, having been appointed by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; in 2009.\nDolan served as the president of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Conference%20of%20Catholic%20Bishops\"&gt;United States Conference of Catholic Bishops&lt;/a&gt; from 2010 to 2013 and was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 2012.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"National%20Catholic%20Reporter\"&gt;National Catholic Reporter&lt;/a&gt;\" says that Dolan represents &lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; values and has a charismatic media personality. He previously served as &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20North%20American%20College\"&gt;Rector of the Pontifical North American College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; from 1994 to 2001, an &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20St.%20Louis\"&gt;Auxiliary Bishop of St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; from 2001 to 2002, and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Milwaukee\"&gt;Archbishop of Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt; from 2002 to 2009.\nEarly life.\nThe eldest of five children, Dolan was born in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, to Robert (d. 1977) and Shirley (&lt;a href=\"n%C3%A9e\"&gt;n\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; Radcliffe) Dolan. His father was an &lt;a href=\"aircraft\"&gt;aircraft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aerospace%20engineering\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;, working as a floor supervisor at &lt;a href=\"McDonnell%20Douglas\"&gt;McDonnell Douglas&lt;/a&gt;. He has two brothers, one of whom, Bob, is a former &lt;a href=\"Radio%20personality\"&gt;radio talk-show host&lt;/a&gt;, and two sisters. The family later moved to &lt;a href=\"Ballwin%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Ballwin&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb of St. Louis, where they attended Holy Infant Roman Catholic Church.\nDolan exhibited a strong interest in the &lt;a href=\"Priesthood%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;Roman Catholic priesthood&lt;/a&gt; from an early age, once saying, \"I can never remember a time I didn't want to be a priest.\" He would also pretend to celebrate &lt;a href=\"Mass%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;Mass&lt;/a&gt; as a child.\nPriesthood and cardinalate.\nDolan entered Saint Louis Preparatory Seminary (now &lt;a href=\"Kenrick%E2%80%93Glennon%20Seminary\"&gt;Kenrick\u2013Glennon Seminary&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Shrewsbury, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, in 1964, and later obtained a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Bachelor of Arts&lt;/a&gt; degree in &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kenrick-Glennon%20Seminary\"&gt;Cardinal Glennon College&lt;/a&gt;. He was sent by Cardinal &lt;a href=\"John%20Carberry\"&gt;John Carberry&lt;/a&gt; to further his studies in Rome, where he attended the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20North%20American%20College\"&gt;Pontifical North American College&lt;/a&gt;. Dolan is also an &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20people%20associated%20with%20the%20Pontifical%20University%20of%20St.%20Thomas%20Aquinas\"&gt;alumnus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20University%20of%20St.%20Thomas%20Aquinas%20%28Angelicum%29\"&gt;Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas \"Angelicum\"&lt;/a&gt; from which he earned the degree of &lt;a href=\"Licentiate%20of%20Sacred%20Theology\"&gt;Licentiate of Sacred Theology&lt;/a&gt; in 1976.\nDolan was &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Orders\"&gt;ordained&lt;/a&gt; a priest on June 19, 1976, by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Thomas%20O%27Meara\"&gt;Edward O'Meara&lt;/a&gt;, who was an Auxiliary Bishop of St. Louis and later Archbishop of Indianapolis. Dolan then served as an &lt;a href=\"Curate\"&gt;associate pastor&lt;/a&gt; at Cur\u00e9 of Ars in Shrewsbury and Immacolata Roman Catholic Parish in &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20Heights%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Richmond Heights&lt;/a&gt; until 1979. From there he began his &lt;a href=\"Doctorate\"&gt;doctoral&lt;/a&gt; studies at &lt;a href=\"The%20Catholic%20University%20of%20America\"&gt;The Catholic University of America&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"John%20Tracy%20Ellis\"&gt;John Tracy Ellis&lt;/a&gt;, with a concentration on the history of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;church in America&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"thesis\"&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt; centered on Bishop &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Vincent%20O%27Hara\"&gt;Edwin Vincent O'Hara&lt;/a&gt; of Kansas City, and was eventually published in book form. Upon Dolan's return to Missouri, he performed &lt;a href=\"Parish%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;pastoral&lt;/a&gt; work from 1983 to 1987. During this time he collaborated with Archbishop &lt;a href=\"John%20L.%20May\"&gt;John L. May&lt;/a&gt; in reforming the &lt;a href=\"Diocese\"&gt;archdiocesan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"seminary\"&gt;seminary&lt;/a&gt;.\nDolan was then named &lt;a href=\"secretary\"&gt;secretary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nunciature%20of%20the%20Holy%20See%20in%20Washington%20DC\"&gt;Apostolic Nunciature&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a liaison between &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20the%20Roman%20Catholic%20dioceses%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American dioceses&lt;/a&gt; and the nunciature. In 1992, he was appointed vice-&lt;a href=\"Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29\"&gt;rector&lt;/a&gt; of his \"&lt;a href=\"alma%20mater\"&gt;alma mater&lt;/a&gt;\" Kenrick-Glennon Seminary, where he also served as &lt;a href=\"Spiritual%20direction\"&gt;spiritual director&lt;/a&gt; and taught &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Christianity\"&gt;Church history&lt;/a&gt;. He was also an &lt;a href=\"adjunct%20professor\"&gt;adjunct professor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"theology\"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Louis%20University\"&gt;St. Louis University&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1994 until June 2001, Dolan held the office of &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20North%20American%20College%23Rectors\"&gt;rector of the Pontifical North American College&lt;/a&gt; in Rome. During his tenure he published \"Priests for the Third Millennium\", and taught at the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Gregorian%20University\"&gt;Pontifical Gregorian University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20University%20of%20Saint%20Thomas%20Aquinas\"&gt;\"Angelicum\"&lt;/a&gt;. He also was granted the title of &lt;a href=\"Monsignor\"&gt;Monsignor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; in 1994.\nAuxiliary Bishop of St. Louis.\nOn June 19, 2001, Dolan was appointed &lt;a href=\"Auxiliary%20Bishop\"&gt;Auxiliary Bishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20St.%20Louis\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Titular%20Bishop\"&gt;Titular Bishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Natchesium\"&gt;Natchesium&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;. He received his &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;episcopal consecration&lt;/a&gt; on the following August 15 from &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Francis%20Rigali\"&gt;Archbishop Justin Rigali&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Fred%20Naumann\"&gt;Bishops Joseph Naumann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20John%20Sheridan\"&gt;Michael Sheridan&lt;/a&gt; serving as &lt;a href=\"Consecrator\"&gt;co-consecrators&lt;/a&gt;. He chose as his episcopal &lt;a href=\"motto\"&gt;motto&lt;/a&gt;: \"Ad Quem Ibimus\", meaning, \"Lord, To Whom Shall We Go?\" ().\nArchbishop of Milwaukee.\nOn June 25, 2002, Dolan was named the tenth &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Milwaukee\"&gt;Archbishop of Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wisconsin\"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. He was formally &lt;a href=\"Enthronement\"&gt;installed&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20St.%20John%20the%20Evangelist%20%28Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin%29\"&gt;Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist&lt;/a&gt; on August 28, 2002. Dolan said he was challenged and haunted by the &lt;a href=\"Sexual%20abuse%20scandal%20in%20Catholic%20archdiocese%20of%20Milwaukee\"&gt;sexual abuse scandal in that diocese&lt;/a&gt;, which broke during his tenure. According to WTAQ news, \"An attorney says at least 8,000 kids were sexually abused by over 100 priests and other offenders in the Milwaukee Catholic Diocese.\"\nDolan took a special interest in priests and &lt;a href=\"Vocational%20discernment%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;vocations&lt;/a&gt;, and the number of &lt;a href=\"seminary\"&gt;seminary&lt;/a&gt; enrollments rose during his tenure. In an outdoor Mass in September 2002, Dolan briefly wore a \"&lt;a href=\"cheesehead\"&gt;cheesehead&lt;/a&gt;\" hat in tribute to the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20Packers\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; during his &lt;a href=\"homily\"&gt;homily&lt;/a&gt;. He also wrote \"Called to Be Holy\" (2005) and \"To Whom Shall We Go? Lessons from the Apostle Peter\" (2008), and co-hosted a television program with his brother called \"Living Our Faith\".\nIn June 2012 it was revealed that Dolan \"authorized payments of as much as $20,000 to sexually abusive priests as an incentive for them to agree to dismissal from the priesthood when he was the archbishop of Milwaukee\" and that \"the archdiocese did make such payments..., thereby allowing the church to remove them from the payroll.\"\nApostolic Administrator of Green Bay.\nOn September 28, 2007, Dolan was appointed as the &lt;a href=\"apostolic%20administrator\"&gt;apostolic administrator&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Green%20Bay\"&gt;Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay&lt;/a&gt;. He continued in this position until he resigned on July 9, 2008, on the appointment of &lt;a href=\"David%20L.%20Ricken\"&gt;David L. Ricken&lt;/a&gt; as Bishop of Green Bay.\nArchbishop of New York.\nOn February 23, 2009, Dolan was appointed the tenth &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;Archbishop of New York&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt;. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, the nation's second-largest after the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, serves over 2.5 million Roman Catholics. He succeeded Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Egan\"&gt;Edward Egan&lt;/a&gt;, who reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 in 2007. According to Dolan, he was informed of his appointment \"nine, ten days\" prior to the official announcement. Recalling the phone call he received from &lt;a href=\"Nunciature%20of%20the%20Holy%20See%20in%20Washington%20DC\"&gt;Apostolic Nuncio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pietro%20Sambi\"&gt;Pietro Sambi&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to his appointments as Auxiliary Roman Catholic Bishop of St. Louis and Archbishop of Milwaukee when Dolan was told that the Pope (John Paul II) \"would like [him] to\" take the posts, he said that Sambi \"was quite factual\" in that he told him that \"the Pope (Benedict XVI) had appointed [him]\" to New York, giving Dolan little choice other than to accept.\nBefore Dolan's appointment, his name had been repeatedly mentioned as a possible successor to Egan, but he downplayed such speculation, saying, \"Anytime there's kind of a major &lt;a href=\"Episcopal%20see\"&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; that opens, what have we seen with &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Washington\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Baltimore\"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, now &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, my name for some reason comes up. I'm flattered.\" &lt;a href=\"John%20L.%20Allen%20Jr.\"&gt;John L. Allen Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, Vatican correspondent for the \"&lt;a href=\"National%20Catholic%20Reporter\"&gt;National Catholic Reporter&lt;/a&gt;\", has noted that Pope Benedict's appointment of Dolan, like those of &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Wuerl\"&gt;Donald Wuerl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20Frederick%20O%27Brien\"&gt;Edwin O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dennis%20Marion%20Schnurr\"&gt;Dennis Schnurr&lt;/a&gt;, follows a pattern of choosing prelates \"who are basically conservative in both their politics and their theology, but also upbeat, pastoral figures given to dialogue.\"\nDolan pledged to challenge anti-Catholic sentiment, especially claims that the Church is unenlightened because it opposes &lt;a href=\"same-sex%20marriage\"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; and abortion. He hoped to build confidence among people affected by the sexual abuse scandals, which he described as \"a continuing source of shame\".\nDolan was formally installed as Archbishop of New York at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;St. Patrick's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Wednesday\"&gt;Easter Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, April 15, 2009. He wore the &lt;a href=\"pectoral%20cross\"&gt;pectoral cross&lt;/a&gt; used by his 19th-century predecessor &lt;a href=\"John%20Hughes%20%28archbishop%29\"&gt;John Hughes&lt;/a&gt;. In attendance were eleven cardinals and several New York elected officials. He received the &lt;a href=\"pallium\"&gt;pallium&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"vestment\"&gt;vestment&lt;/a&gt; worn by &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20bishop\"&gt;metropolitan bishop&lt;/a&gt;s, from Pope Benedict XVI on June 29, 2009, in a ceremony at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica\"&gt;St. Peter's Basilica&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after his arrival in New York, Dolan oversaw a widely consultative pair of \"strategic planning\" processes, examining the archdiocese's hundreds of grade schools (\"Pathways to Excellence\", 2009\u20132013) and parishes (\"Making All Things New\", 2010\u20132015). Ultimately, Dolan announced that dozens of under-utilized schools and parishes would close or merge with others in their neighborhoods, due to decades-long trends of shifting populations, increasing expenses, declining attendance, and decreasing clergy.\nDolan served as &lt;a href=\"Chair%20%28official%29\"&gt;chairman&lt;/a&gt; of the board of directors of &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Relief%20Services\"&gt;Catholic Relief Services&lt;/a&gt; (in which capacity he visited &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;) until his election as president of the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Conference%20of%20Catholic%20Bishops\"&gt;U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops&lt;/a&gt;, and he remains a member of the &lt;a href=\"Board%20of%20Trustees%20of%20The%20Catholic%20University%20of%20America\"&gt;Board of Trustees of The Catholic University of America&lt;/a&gt;. Within the Conference of Bishops, he chairs the Priestly Life and Ministry Committee and sits on the Subcommittee on the Church in Africa. In November 2007, he lost the election for &lt;a href=\"Vice%20President\"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; of the Conference, being defeated by Bishop &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Frederick%20Kicanas\"&gt;Gerald Kicanas&lt;/a&gt; by a margin of twenty-two votes.\nDolan was the apostolic visitor to Irish seminaries as part of the &lt;a href=\"Apostolic%20visitation%20to%20Ireland\"&gt;Apostolic visitation to Ireland&lt;/a&gt; following the 2009 publication of the Ryan and &lt;a href=\"Murphy%20Report\"&gt;Murphy Report&lt;/a&gt;s on sexual abuse. Dolan was part of a team that included Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Cormac%20Murphy-O%27Connor\"&gt;Cormac Murphy-O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;, archbishop emeritus of Westminster; Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Se%C3%A1n%20Patrick%20O%27Malley\"&gt;Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley&lt;/a&gt; of Boston; Toronto's Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Christopher%20Collins\"&gt;Thomas Christopher Collins&lt;/a&gt;; and Ottawa's Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Terrence%20Prendergast\"&gt;Terrence Prendergast&lt;/a&gt;. They reported their findings to &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; in 2012.\nOn January 5, 2011, Dolan was appointed among the first members of the newly created &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Council%20for%20Promoting%20the%20New%20Evangelization\"&gt;Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn December 11, 2011, he was awarded the rank of Knight Grand Cross of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Saints%20Maurice%20and%20Lazarus\"&gt;Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Emmanuel%2C%20Prince%20of%20Naples\"&gt;Victor Emmanuel, Prince of Naples&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2011\u20132012, Dolan led a root-and-branch review of all structures and processes at the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Irish%20College\"&gt;Pontifical Irish College&lt;/a&gt; in Rome. His report was highly critical of the college, as a result of which three Irish members of the staff were sent home and a fourth resigned. Four Irish archbishops, Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Se%C3%A1n%20Brady\"&gt;Se\u00e1n Brady&lt;/a&gt;, Archbishop of Armagh; the Archbishop of Dublin, &lt;a href=\"Diarmuid%20Martin\"&gt;Diarmuid Martin&lt;/a&gt;; the Archbishop of Tuam, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Neary%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;Michael Neary&lt;/a&gt;; and the Archbishop of Cashel, &lt;a href=\"Dermot%20Clifford\"&gt;Dermot Clifford&lt;/a&gt;, were sent a copy of the visitation report by the Vatican. A response prepared for them said \"a deep prejudice appears to have coloured the visitation and from the outset and it led to the hostile tone and content of the report\". The visitation report said \"a disturbingly significant number of seminarians gave a negative assessment of the atmosphere of the house\". Staff, it added, were \"critical about any emphasis on Rome, tradition, the magisterium, piety or assertive orthodoxy, while the students are enthusiastic about these features\". A change in the staff was recommended. Elsewhere the report said: \"The apostolic visitor noted, and heard from students, an 'anti-ecclesial bias' in theological formation.\"\nOn December 29, 2011, Dolan was appointed a member of the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Council%20for%20Social%20Communications\"&gt;Pontifical Council for Social Communications&lt;/a&gt; for a five-year renewable term. On April 21, 2011, he was appointed a member of the &lt;a href=\"Congregation%20for%20the%20Oriental%20Churches\"&gt;Congregation for the Oriental Churches&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2012, Dolan expressed his public disappointment in the &lt;a href=\"contraceptive%20mandate\"&gt;contraceptive mandate&lt;/a&gt; promulgated by American President &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;. In a televised &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; interview, Dolan condemned what was, in his view, government interference dismissing the right to religious conscience and religious freedom regarding the mandatory compulsion of religious groups and organizations to provide &lt;a href=\"abortifacient\"&gt;abortifacient&lt;/a&gt; drugs and &lt;a href=\"contraception\"&gt;contraception&lt;/a&gt; insurance coverage to its hired employees, while at the same time against the moral tenets of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; faith. After Obama revised the rule, Dolan said the \"first decision was a terribly misguided judgment\" and said the new rule was \"a first step\".\nOn January 24, 2012, Dolan went on a religious pilgrimage to the &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Holy Land&lt;/a&gt;, where he met the then &lt;a href=\"Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem\"&gt;Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fouad%20Twal\"&gt;Fouad Twal&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn November 30, 2013, Pope Francis named Dolan a member of the &lt;a href=\"Congregation%20for%20Catholic%20Education\"&gt;Congregation for Catholic Education&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn September 3, 2014, Dolan denied requests by the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Peoria\"&gt;Diocese of Peoria&lt;/a&gt; to receive the remains of Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Fulton%20J.%20Sheen\"&gt;Fulton Sheen&lt;/a&gt;, who was entombed in St. Patrick's Cathedral, renewing the historical controversy over Sheen's body and effectively suspending Sheen's cause for sainthood. On November 17, 2016, Judge Arlene Bluth of the &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;New York State Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ordered Sheen's remains transferred from St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York to St. Mary's Cathedral in Peoria, Illinois.\nOn September 13, 2014, Dolan was appointed a member of the &lt;a href=\"Congregation%20for%20the%20Evangelization%20of%20Peoples\"&gt;Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn November 2, 2015, American Jewish Committee (AJC) \"presented its Isaiah Award for Exemplary Interreligious Leadership to Cardinal Timothy Dolan in recognition of his steadfast contribution and ongoing commitment to the relationship between our respective faiths.\"\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Inauguration%20of%20Donald%20Trump\"&gt;inauguration of President Trump&lt;/a&gt; on January 20, 2017, Dolan gave the first benediction. His invocation involved a recitation of &lt;a href=\"Solomon\"&gt;King Solomon's&lt;/a&gt; prayer from the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Book of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;.\nDolan completed a pilgrimage to the &lt;a href=\"Knock%20Shrine\"&gt;Knock Shrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 and, on May 13, 2017, Dolan celebrated a &lt;a href=\"requiem\"&gt;requiem&lt;/a&gt; mass when Tim Curry, the youngest witness to the Knock apparition, was reinterred in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Patrick%27s%20Old%20Cathedral\"&gt;St. Patrick's Old Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; cemetery in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Manhattan\"&gt;Lower Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; after being disinterred from an unmarked grave on &lt;a href=\"Long%20Island\"&gt;Long Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresident of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\nDolan was elected on November 16, 2010, to the presidency of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Conference%20of%20Catholic%20Bishops\"&gt;United States Conference of Catholic Bishops&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first New York bishop to attain the post. Dolan replaced &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20Francis%20George\"&gt;Cardinal Francis George&lt;/a&gt;, who did not run for re-election. In a vote of 128\u2013111, Dolan beat out nine others, including &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Frederick%20Kicanas\"&gt;Bishop Gerald F. Kicanas&lt;/a&gt; of Tucson, Arizona, to win the three-year term. Dolan took office two days later, and served until November 12, 2013.\nElevation to the College of Cardinals.\nOn January 6, 2012, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; announced that Dolan would be created a &lt;a href=\"cardinal%20%28catholicism%29\"&gt;cardinal&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Papal%20consistory\"&gt;consistory&lt;/a&gt; held on February 18, 2012. Archbishop Dolan was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope Benedict on February 18, 2012, receiving the traditional red biretta and gold ring during a ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Peter%27s%20Basilica\"&gt;Saint Peter's Basilica&lt;/a&gt;. The day prior, he addressed the pope and the College of Cardinals on spreading the faith in a secularized world. He was created &lt;a href=\"Cardinal-Priest\"&gt;Cardinal-Priest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20titular%20churches%20in%20Rome\"&gt;Nostra Signora di Guadalupe a Monte Mario&lt;/a&gt;. He was the first Archbishop of New York since 1946 not to receive the &lt;a href=\"titular%20church\"&gt;titular church&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Santi%20Giovanni%20e%20Paolo%2C%20Rome\"&gt;Santi Giovanni e Paolo&lt;/a&gt;, as that title was still being held by Cardinal Egan, archbishop emeritus of New York.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Benedict%20XVI\"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; announced his retirement due to ill health, effective February 28, 2013, Dolan was named in the press as a \"&lt;a href=\"papabile\"&gt;papabile&lt;/a&gt;\", a plausible successor for election to the Papacy. However, on March 13, 2013, the conclave instead elected Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Mario%20Bergoglio\"&gt;Jorge Mario Bergoglio&lt;/a&gt;, who took the name &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Francis\"&gt;Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt;.\nLetter to all cardinals.\nIn July 2020, conservative author &lt;a href=\"George%20Weigel\"&gt;George Weigel&lt;/a&gt;'s book \"The Next Pope: The Office of Peter and a Church in Mission\" was sent to all 222 cardinals in the Catholic Church with an accompanying letter from Cardinal Dolan stating: \"I am grateful to &lt;a href=\"Ignatius%20Press\"&gt;Ignatius Press&lt;/a&gt; for making this important reflection on the future of the Church available to the College of Cardinals.\" Some cardinals saw this as a violation of the 1996 apostolic constitution \"&lt;a href=\"Universi%20Dominici%20gregis\"&gt;Universi Dominici gregis&lt;/a&gt;\" in which Pope John Paul II \"forbid(s) anyone, even if he is a Cardinal, during the Pope's lifetime and without having consulted him, to make plans concerning the election of his successor.\" Dolan had earlier been critical of the way Pope Francis had organized the 2015 &lt;a href=\"Fourteenth%20Ordinary%20General%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Synod%20of%20Bishops\"&gt;Synod on the Family&lt;/a&gt;. Weigel replied that his book \"does not contain a single sentence about a future conclave.\" \"No potential candidates are named and no conclave strategy is discussed.\" \"The book is a reflection on the future of the Office of Peter in what Pope Francis has called a Church 'permanently in mission.' Period.\"\nViews.\nRace and police issues.\nOn June 2, 2020, Cardinal Dolan spoke on his podcast regarding the protests and police action following the murders of &lt;a href=\"George%20Floyd\"&gt;George Floyd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ahmaud%20Arbery\"&gt;Ahmaud Arbery&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"shooting%20of%20Breonna%20Taylor\"&gt;shooting of Breonna Taylor&lt;/a&gt;. In this podcast interview, he attempted to speak to both protesters and police. He argued that police were mostly good people, even comparing them to priests. He also said that the protesters had an important message. He said that &lt;a href=\"black%20lives%20matter\"&gt;black lives matter&lt;/a&gt;, bracketing the statement before and after with \"&lt;a href=\"all%20lives%20matter\"&gt;all lives matter&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"police lives matter.\"\nIn a June 28, 2020 \"&lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street%20Journal\"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" opinion piece, Dolan argued against removing statues of historical figures, even if they had a history of upholding slavery and white supremacy. This followed weeks of protests in which monuments commemorating figures associated with racism, white supremacy, and colonialism had been &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20monuments%20and%20memorials%20removed%20during%20the%20George%20Floyd%20protests\"&gt;removed by protestors and civic leaders&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn an opinion piece for the \"New York Post\" published on July 1, 2020, Dolan called for an end to the demonization of the NYPD. He said that \"the most stinging rebuke\" of the murder of George Floyd by a policeman in Minneapolis \"comes fromguess who? The cops I chat with on the sidewalks of New York.\" He wrote that \"in a recent meeting with community activists, one black leader reminded us, 'Don't give me this \"get-rid-of-the-cops\" rant! You on Madison Avenue or Park Avenue might not need the police. We up in The Bronx sure do!'\"\nAbortion and LGBT issues.\nIn November 2009, Dolan signed an ecumenical statement known as the \"\", calling on evangelicals, Roman Catholics and Orthodox not to comply with rules and laws permitting &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"same-sex%20marriage\"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; and other matters that go against their religious consciences. It calls for civil disobedience from Christian officials and laymen on these issues.\nIn October 2017, Auxiliary Bishop &lt;a href=\"John%20Joseph%20O%27Hara\"&gt;John O'Hara&lt;/a&gt; intervened on behalf of Dolan to prohibit a New York parish church from hosting the International Human Rights Art Festival because of its gay and transgender content. The director of the festival declined to remove the two performances that the Archdiocese specifically objected to, and instead moved the entire show to an Episcopal church in Brooklyn.\nWar and capital punishment.\nWhile noting that the \"Church has weighed in\" against the &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20War\"&gt;war in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"capital%20punishment\"&gt;capital punishment&lt;/a&gt;, Dolan defended his silence regarding President &lt;a href=\"George%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s 2001 appearance at Notre Dame by saying, \"Where President Bush would have taken positions on those two hot-button issues that I'd be uncomfortable with, namely the war and capital punishment, I would have to give him the benefit of the doubt to say that those two issues are open to some discussion and are not intrinsically evil. In the Catholic mindset... that would not apply to abortion.\"\nSexual abuse scandal.\nIn 2002, the St. Louis archbishop assigned Dolan to investigate &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20sex%20abuse%20cases\"&gt;Roman Catholic priests accused of sexual misconduct&lt;/a&gt; in the archdiocese. During the investigation, Dolan spoke with parishes, victims, and the media about the scandals, and invited victims of clerical abuse to come forward. Commenting on his meetings with them, Dolan said: \"it is impossible to exaggerate the gravity of the situation, and the suffering that victims feel, because I've spent the last four months being with them, crying with them, having them express their anger to me\". Dolan dismissed abusive priests, which earned him the ire of some St. Louis parishioners who remained loyal to their dismissed priests and referred to Dolan's investigation as a \"&lt;a href=\"witch%20hunt\"&gt;witch hunt&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn a 2003 letter to Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Ratzinger\"&gt;Joseph Ratzinger&lt;/a&gt;, requesting that the Vatican process be expedited for the &lt;a href=\"Loss%20of%20clerical%20state%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;laicization&lt;/a&gt; of priests who he believed were \"remorseless and a serious risk to children\", Dolan wrote: \"As victims organize and become more public, the potential for true scandal is very real.\" In May 2012, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" revealed that the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, then headed by Dolan, had paid some abusive priests \u2013 although already dismissed from their priestly duties \u2013 up to $20,000 to leave the priesthood immediately rather than force the church to initiate time-consuming and expensive laicization proceedings against them. The archdiocese noted that the \"unassignable priests\" were still receiving full salaries and would continue to do so until they were formally laicized; and that the payouts were a \"motivation\" so that the priests would not contest being defrocked. The &lt;a href=\"Survivors%20Network%20of%20those%20Abused%20by%20Priests\"&gt;Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests&lt;/a&gt; sent a formal protest asking, \"In what other occupation, especially one working with families and operating schools and youth programs, is an employee given a cash bonus for raping and sexually assaulting children?\" Dolan had previously responded to accusations that he had given \"payoffs\" to accused priests as \"false, preposterous and unjust\".\nIn 2011, Dolan thanked &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Donohue\"&gt;Bill Donohue&lt;/a&gt; for a press release, reproduced on the Archdiocese of New York website, in which Donohue referred to the non-profit support group &lt;a href=\"Survivors%20Network%20of%20those%20Abused%20by%20Priests\"&gt;Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests&lt;/a&gt; as a \"phony victims' group\".\nIn July 2013, documents made public during bankruptcy proceedings for the Archdiocese of Milwaukee showed that Dolan had sought permission to move $57 million in church funds to protect the assets from victims of clerical abuse. In a 2007 letter to the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; requesting permission to move the funds, Dolan wrote \"By transferring these assets to the trust, I foresee an improved protection of these funds from any legal claim and liability.\" Dolan had previously denied that he tried to conceal assets from child sex abuse victims claiming compensation, calling the accusations \"old and discredited\" and \"malarkey.\" The Vatican approved the request in five weeks.\nIn 2018 after the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20jury%20investigation%20of%20Catholic%20Church%20sexual%20abuse%20in%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania report&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20McCarrick\"&gt;McCarrick scandal&lt;/a&gt;, a CNN interviewer asked Dolan whether homosexuality was a cause of the abuse. He answered: \"I don't think that's the sole root of it. The sole root of it is a lack of chastity, a lack of virtue. This isn't about right or left. This isn't about gay or straight. This is about right and wrong.\"\nIn 2019, Dolan was reported to have received, together with other influential U.S. Catholic leaders, substantial monetary gifts from West Virginia bishop &lt;a href=\"Michael%20J.%20Bransfield\"&gt;Michael J. Bransfield&lt;/a&gt;, who had resigned following allegations of sexual misconduct. Bransfield's diocese had reimbursed him for the gifts. Although Dolan did not return a request for comment, other bishops reported that they did not know that Bransfield had been reimbursed by the diocese or that he was accused of sexual misconduct at the time that they received the gifts, and that they had returned the funds or given them to charity.\nTerrorism.\nDolan visited &lt;a href=\"World%20Trade%20Center%20site\"&gt;Ground Zero&lt;/a&gt;, the site of the &lt;a href=\"September%2011%20attacks\"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;, the week after his installation as Archbishop of New York. After reciting the same prayer used by Benedict XVI during his visit to the United States, Dolan remarked, \"We'll never stop crying. But it's also about &lt;a href=\"Aftermath%20of%20the%20September%2011%20attacks\"&gt;September 12th&lt;/a&gt; and all the renewal and rebuilding and hope and solidarity and compassion that symbolizes this great community and still does.\" Dolan condemned as a miscarriage of justice the release of the convicted Lockerbie bomber &lt;a href=\"Abdelbaset%20al-Megrahi\"&gt;Abdelbaset al-Megrahi&lt;/a&gt; and his reception in Libya."
