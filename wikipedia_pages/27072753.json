The solid, imperforate shell has an ovate-conic shape. It is orange-colored, brown or gray, sometimes banded, flammulated, or maculated with white or brown. The conic &lt;a href=\"Spire%20%28mollusc%29\"&gt;spire&lt;/a&gt; is acute. The &lt;a href=\"Suture%20%28anatomy%29\"&gt;suture&lt;/a&gt; is subcanaliculate. The 5-6 convex &lt;a href=\"Whorl%20%28mollusc%29\"&gt;whorl&lt;/a&gt;s are somewhat flattened in the middle. They are ornamented with numerous unequal spiral granose, spinose or squamose &lt;a href=\"Lira%20%28mollusc%29\"&gt;lira&lt;/a&gt;e, of which the subsutural and three or four submedian are more prominent. The typical form is very sharply sculptured, the principal lirae occasionally bearing vaulted scales. The white &lt;a href=\"Aperture%20%28mollusc%29\"&gt;aperture&lt;/a&gt; is subcircular, and subangular above. There is no &lt;a href=\"Umbilicus%20%28mollusc%29\"&gt;umbilicus&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Peristome%20%28gastropod%29\"&gt;peristome&lt;/a&gt; is slightly produced below. The &lt;a href=\"Columella%20%28gastropod%29\"&gt;columella&lt;/a&gt; has a heavy white callus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Operculum%20%28gastropod%29\"&gt;operculum&lt;/a&gt; is castaneous within, with four rapidly increasing whorls. Its nucleus is one-third the distance across the face. The outer surface is convex and nearly smooth. It is white, or stained with brown and green around the middle.\nHabitat.\nMinimum recorded depth is 0 m. Maximum recorded depth is 141 m."
