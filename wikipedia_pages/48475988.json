Jharkhand was a \u201claboratory\u201d for &lt;a href=\"Naxalite-Maoist%20insurgency\"&gt;Naxalites&lt;/a&gt; to experiment with their ideas of establishing a parallel government. As of 2005, 16 of the 22 districts in the state, including Hazaribagh district, was transformed into a \u201cguerrilla zone\u201d. The movement was not restricted to armed operations but included &lt;a href=\"kangaroo%20court\"&gt;kangaroo court&lt;/a&gt;s called Jan adalats, elected village bodies and people's police. Jharkhand, with a dense forest cover over a large part of the state, offers a favourable terrain for the Naxalites to build their bases and operate. Annual fatalities in Jharkhand were 117 in 2003 and 150 in 2004. In 2013 Jharkhand was considered one of the two states in the country most affected by &lt;a href=\"Left%20wing%20extremism\"&gt;Left wing extremism&lt;/a&gt; and Jharkhand police set up an exclusive cell to deal with Maoist activities.
