    "text": "The Alteration is a 1976 &lt;a href=\"alternative%20history\"&gt;alternative history&lt;/a&gt; novel by &lt;a href=\"Kingsley%20Amis\"&gt;Kingsley Amis&lt;/a&gt;, set in a &lt;a href=\"Parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29\"&gt;parallel universe&lt;/a&gt; in which the &lt;a href=\"Protestant%20Reformation\"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt; did not take place. It won the &lt;a href=\"John%20W.%20Campbell%20Memorial%20Award\"&gt;John W. Campbell Memorial Award&lt;/a&gt; in 1977.\nCreative origins.\nIn his biography of Kingsley Amis, Richard Bradford devotes a chapter to \"The Alteration\", its origins and context within the author's life. In 1973, Amis had heard a reproduction of the voice of &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Moreschi\"&gt;Alessandro Moreschi&lt;/a&gt;, the last known European &lt;a href=\"castrato\"&gt;castrato&lt;/a&gt;. Amis disagreed with the proposition that Moreschi's performance could be considered \"great art\", because Moreschi had been castrated, and \"true\" art centred on the celebration of human sexuality.\nBradford argues that this was a matter of considerable importance for Amis himself, as he may have been suffering from &lt;a href=\"impotence\"&gt;impotence&lt;/a&gt; or sexual dysfunction in his marriage, due to advancing age. Thus, he took exception to &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; teaching, based as it was in a &lt;a href=\"magisterium\"&gt;magisterium&lt;/a&gt; of celibate men.\nPlot introduction.\nThe main character, ten-year-old Hubert Anvil, is a chorister at St George's Basilica, Coverley (real world &lt;a href=\"Cowley%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;Cowley&lt;/a&gt;), for whom tragedy beckons when his teachers and the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Church&lt;/a&gt; hierarchy, all the way up to the &lt;a href=\"Pope\"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt; himself, decree that the boy's superb voice is too precious to sacrifice to &lt;a href=\"puberty\"&gt;puberty&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his own misgivings, he must undergo &lt;a href=\"castration\"&gt;castration&lt;/a&gt;, one of the two \"alterations\" of the title. Insight into this world is offered during Anvil's abortive escape from church authorities, with references to alternative world versions of known political and cultural figures. Hubert's mother carries on an illicit affair with the family chaplain, and his brother, Anthony, is a &lt;a href=\"Liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; dissident from repressive church policies.\nIn this timeline, there are two pivotal divergences from known history. &lt;a href=\"Arthur%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Arthur Tudor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;Catherine of Aragon&lt;/a&gt;'s short-lived union produced a son, Stephen II of England. When &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry of York&lt;/a&gt; (\"the Abominable\") tried to usurp his nephew's throne, there was a papal &lt;a href=\"Crusades\"&gt;crusade&lt;/a&gt; (the \"War of the English Succession\") to restore the rightful heir, culminating in the \"Holy Victory\" at Coverley, which was designated as the ecclesiastical capital of England.\nSecondly, the Protestant Reformation did not take place as &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther\"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt; was reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church and later became &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20fictional%20clergy%20and%20religious%20figures\"&gt;Pope Germanian I&lt;/a&gt;. Luther's &lt;a href=\"anti-Semitism\"&gt;anti-Semitism&lt;/a&gt; may have infected this history to a greater extent during his papacy, as the novel discloses that &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; are forced to seclude themselves and wear &lt;a href=\"yellow%20badge\"&gt;yellow stars&lt;/a&gt; to advertise their religious and ethnic identity. In this history, &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20More\"&gt;Thomas More&lt;/a&gt; did not marry, and ascended to the Papacy as &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20fictional%20clergy%20and%20religious%20figures\"&gt;Pope Hadrian VII&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Papacy still holds sway across &lt;a href=\"Western%20Europe\"&gt;Western Europe&lt;/a&gt;, in this version of the twentieth century Protestantism is limited to the breakaway Republic of &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;, which includes such locations as Cranmeria (named after &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Cranmer\"&gt;Thomas Cranmer&lt;/a&gt;), Hussville (named for &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Huss\"&gt;Jan Huss&lt;/a&gt;), Waldensia (&lt;a href=\"Waldensians\"&gt;Waldensians&lt;/a&gt;) and Wyclif City (&lt;a href=\"John%20Wycliffe\"&gt;John Wycliffe&lt;/a&gt;). The head of the &lt;a href=\"schism%20%28religion%29\"&gt;schismatic&lt;/a&gt; church in New England is the &lt;a href=\"Presbyterianism\"&gt;Archpresbyter&lt;/a&gt; of Arnoldstown (named after &lt;a href=\"Benedict%20Arnold\"&gt;Benedict Arnold&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Rudyard%20Kipling\"&gt;Joseph Rudyard Kipling&lt;/a&gt; held office as \"First Citizen\" from 1914\u20131918, while &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Allan%20Poe\"&gt;Edgar Allan Poe&lt;/a&gt; was an acclaimed general who died at the moment of his victory over the combined forces of &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in the war of 1848\u20131850. We learn towards the end of the book that this Protestant state also has unpleasant features, such as practising &lt;a href=\"apartheid\"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt; and a harsh penal system.\nEngland dominates the British Isles with &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; being called \"West-England\" and &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; being annexed to England as \"North-England\". Instead of &lt;a href=\"Representative%20democracy\"&gt;parliamentary democracy&lt;/a&gt;, the English Isles are administered by a &lt;a href=\"Convocation\"&gt;Convocation&lt;/a&gt; of clergy accountable to the Catholic hierarchy. The rule of the Church is absolute and totalitarian, controlled by the Holy Office, a sort of &lt;a href=\"KGB\"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gestapo\"&gt;Gestapo&lt;/a&gt; equivalent. (Monsignors Henricus and Laurentius \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Himmler\"&gt;Heinrich Himmler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lavrentiy%20Beria\"&gt;Lavrentiy Beria&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 are mentioned in passing.)\nThe state of the world is illustrated in a description of national, clerical and royal figures at the funeral of Stephen III, late King of England, which opens the book. There is reference to the Kings of &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that no Italian nation-state exists in this history due to the temporal strength of the Papacy. The Crown Prince of &lt;a href=\"Tsardom%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Muscovy&lt;/a&gt; is also mentioned, suggesting that Tsarism holds sway, and the &lt;a href=\"Dauphin%20of%20France\"&gt;Dauphin&lt;/a&gt; leads one to conclude that the French monarchy is also still in existence. &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; is a nation-state, known as Almaigne and ruled by an Emperor, although it may not have exactly the same national boundaries. The \"Vicar General\" of the \"Emperor Patriarch\" of Candia suggests that the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Greek Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; survives as a separate ecclesiastical jurisdiction, albeit exiled from its native &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; (which is still under &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Greece\"&gt;Ottoman domination&lt;/a&gt;) and with its headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, this opening section cites the \"Viceroys\" of India, &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"New%20Spain\"&gt;New Spain&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that &lt;a href=\"colonialism\"&gt;colonialism&lt;/a&gt; and direct &lt;a href=\"imperialism\"&gt;imperialism&lt;/a&gt; are still realities here.\nA Christian/&lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cold%20war\"&gt;cold war&lt;/a&gt; exists between the Papacy and the Ottoman Empire. Described as a war against an opponent that can never be destroyed and which can be held in check only by maintaining permanent armies and fleets, it serves the useful purpose of distracting any tendency to rebel or question. &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20fictional%20clergy%20and%20religious%20figures\"&gt;Pope John XXIV&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Machiavelli\"&gt;Machiavellian&lt;/a&gt; Yorkshireman, who allows the cold war to heat up as a &lt;a href=\"Malthusian\"&gt;Malthusian&lt;/a&gt; plot to resolve Europe's &lt;a href=\"population%20growth\"&gt;population growth&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the church has access to &lt;a href=\"Biological%20warfare\"&gt;bacteriological warfare&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative to &lt;a href=\"birth%20control\"&gt;birth control&lt;/a&gt;, whose prior papal prohibition John XXIV opposes. The book's coda, set in 1991, fifteen years after the events of the main body of the book, reveals that events have turned out as the Pope planned. Europe's surplus population has become cannon fodder for the war, which ended in a narrow victory, despite mention that the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; got as far as &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. However, one of Hubert's childhood friends, Decuman, is mentioned as being among the occupation troops in &lt;a href=\"Adrianople\"&gt;Adrianople&lt;/a&gt; in far western &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that the Ottomans either lost the war, or at least were forced to make significant territorial concessions to the Catholic West.\n&lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;'s work was suppressed in this history, although &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Kyd\"&gt;Thomas Kyd&lt;/a&gt;'s original text of \"&lt;a href=\"Hamlet\"&gt;Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;\" has survived, and is still performed in 1976 (albeit only in New England). &lt;a href=\"Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley\"&gt;Shelley&lt;/a&gt; lived until 1853, at which point he set fire to &lt;a href=\"Castel%20Gandolfo\"&gt;Castel Gandolfo&lt;/a&gt; outside Rome and perished. By contrast, &lt;a href=\"Mozart\"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beethoven\"&gt;Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Blake\"&gt;Blake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20Hockney\"&gt;Hockney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holman%20Hunt\"&gt;Holman Hunt&lt;/a&gt; have allowed their talents to submit to religious authority. Edward Bradford argues that the choice of authors and musicians here is not meant to imply Amis's own preferences, but questions the value of art subordinated to a destructive ideology that represses &lt;a href=\"sexual%20freedom\"&gt;sexual freedom&lt;/a&gt; and human choice. Underscoring the clerical domination of this world, Hubert's small collection of books includes a set of Father Bond novels (an amalgam of &lt;a href=\"Father%20Brown\"&gt;Father Brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Bond\"&gt;James Bond&lt;/a&gt;), as well as \"Lord of the Chalices\" (\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings\"&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/a&gt;\"), \"Saint Lemuel's Travels\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Gulliver%27s%20Travels\"&gt;Gulliver's Travels&lt;/a&gt;\"), and \"The Wind in the Cloisters\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Wind%20in%20the%20Willows\"&gt;Wind in the Willows&lt;/a&gt;\"). There is also reference to a Monsignor &lt;a href=\"Jean-Paul%20Sartre\"&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Jesuits\"&gt;Jesuits&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Ayer\"&gt;A. J. Ayer&lt;/a&gt; (who was in real life a noted atheist) is Professor of Dogmatic Theology at &lt;a href=\"New%20College%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;New College, Oxford&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Science\" is literally a dirty word, and while \"invention\" is not, the scope of inventors is severely limited. Electricity has been banned; the only form of &lt;a href=\"internal%20combustion%20engine\"&gt;internal combustion engine&lt;/a&gt; permitted is the &lt;a href=\"Diesel%20engine\"&gt;Diesel&lt;/a&gt;, which works without a &lt;a href=\"Spark%20plug\"&gt;spark&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the incidental pleasure of the book is in the \"alternative technology\" reminiscent of Amis's friend and fellow-author &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Harrison%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Harry Harrison&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"High-speed%20rail\"&gt;high-speed train&lt;/a&gt; that takes characters from London to Rome in just seven hours, via &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Sopwith\"&gt;Thomas Sopwith&lt;/a&gt;'s Channel Bridge. &lt;a href=\"Airship\"&gt;Airships&lt;/a&gt; feature as a mode of transportation connecting Europe with Africa and North America, with heavier-than-air vehicles being exclusive to New England.\nAllusion to known historical figures include the political scene in Britain in the 1970s, and may reflect Amis's increasingly conservative attitudes. For example, Lord Stansgate (&lt;a href=\"Tony%20Benn\"&gt;Tony Benn&lt;/a&gt;) presides over the Holy Office, and Officers &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Foot%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;Paul Foot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Corin%20Redgrave\"&gt;Corin Redgrave&lt;/a&gt; are two of its feared operatives. Pope John XXIV is a thinly disguised &lt;a href=\"Harold%20Wilson\"&gt;Harold Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and his Secretary of State is &lt;a href=\"Enrico%20Berlinguer\"&gt;Enrico Berlinguer&lt;/a&gt;. Other references are more obscure; opera-lovers with a good knowledge of Latin will, however, be able to identify the two castrati from the Vatican, Federicus Mirabilis and Lupigradus Viaventosa, as the German singers &lt;a href=\"Fritz%20Wunderlich\"&gt;Fritz Wunderlich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20Windgassen\"&gt;Wolfgang Windgassen&lt;/a&gt;, both recently deceased when Amis was writing.\nAlternative parallel-world novels within \"The Alteration\".\nJust as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20in%20the%20High%20Castle\"&gt;The Man in the High Castle&lt;/a&gt;\" features a book titled \"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy\", depicting a world (but not our own) in which the Axis powers lost &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, so \"The Alteration\" refers to an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20history\"&gt;alternate history&lt;/a&gt; book by one &lt;a href=\"Philip%20K.%20Dick\"&gt;Philip K. Dick&lt;/a&gt; entitled \"The Man in the High Castle\". This book-within-a-book depicts a world in which Stephen II was never born, so the \"Holy Victory\" never happened, and Henry VIII became king legitimately. As in reality, Henry married &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20of%20Aragon\"&gt;Catherine of Aragon&lt;/a&gt;, but their son &lt;a href=\"Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cornwall\"&gt;Henry, Duke of Cornwall&lt;/a&gt; survived infancy, becoming Henry IX in 1547. &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther\"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt; became \"schismatic\" in this world, as he did in reality, and a \"Union\" of former English North American colonies breaks away in 1848 instead of 1776, conquering most of North America. The same book also features the publication of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Origin%20of%20Species\"&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/a&gt;\", the widespread application of electricity including in aviation and Beethoven's composing of twenty symphonies before his death in 1835.\n\"Galliard\", an alternative-universe counterpart to &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Roberts\"&gt;Keith Roberts&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Pavane%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Pavane&lt;/a&gt;\", is also mentioned in this tribute to the subgenre. (The &lt;a href=\"Galliard\"&gt;Galliard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pavane\"&gt;Pavane&lt;/a&gt; were both forms of &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20dance\"&gt;Renaissance dance&lt;/a&gt;.)"
