    "text": "Lucien Leopold Joseph Jottrand (&lt;a href=\"Genappe\"&gt;Genappe&lt;/a&gt;, 31 January 1804 \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Saint-Josse-ten-Noode\"&gt;Saint-Josse-ten-Noode&lt;/a&gt;, 17 December 1877) was a &lt;a href=\"Belgians\"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Walloons\"&gt;Walloon&lt;/a&gt; lawyer, politician, &lt;a href=\"Progressivism\"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Flamingant\"&gt;Flamingant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pan-Netherlands\"&gt;Pan-Netherlander&lt;/a&gt;. He was member of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Congress%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;National Congress of Belgium&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the de facto independence of &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and held a unique position in the young &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Movement\"&gt;Flemish Movement&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nJottrand completed his secondary education in &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20language\"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vilvoorde\"&gt;Vilvoorde&lt;/a&gt; and obtained his doctorate in law at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;University of Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt; in 1825, where he was influenced by the Dutch professor Johannes Kinker, among others. He became a lawyer in Brussels, where he also pleaded in Dutch.\nInitially, Jottrand was loyal to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;United Kingdom of the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, but gradually became more critical due to the authoritarian rule of &lt;a href=\"William%20I%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;William I&lt;/a&gt;. From 1826 he was editor of the opposition newspaper \"Courrier des Pays-Bas\", of which he became owner and editor-in-chief in 1832 and renamed it \"Courrier Belge\". During the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20Revolution\"&gt;Belgian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in 1830, Jottrand, together with &lt;a href=\"%C3%89douard%20Ducp%C3%A9tiaux\"&gt;Edouard Ducp\u00e9tiaux&lt;/a&gt;, designed the later Belgian flag to replace the French tricolor used by French-minded revolutionaries. He was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20des%20douze\"&gt;\"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Douze\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of October 1830 he became a member of the National Congress. He had only been elected as the fifth successor, but because of the early rejection of an effective elector and four successors, he entered Congress as early as November 15. With his 125 interventions, he was the third most active participant in the public session debates. At his insistence, language freedom was added Constitution, making it possible to break the monopoly of French.\nJottrand endorsed the Declaration of Independence and voted for the perpetual exclusion of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Orange-Nassau\"&gt;House of Orange-Nassau&lt;/a&gt;. During the first rounds of voting for a head of state, he gave his vote to &lt;a href=\"Auguste%2C%20Duke%20of%20Leuchtenberg\"&gt;Auguste, Duke of Leuchtenberg&lt;/a&gt; and later that month to Surlet de Chokier as regent. He was one of 45 Congressmen who did not vote for &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20I%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;Leopold of Saxe Coburg&lt;/a&gt;. He also voted against the acceptance of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Eighteen%20Articles\"&gt;Treaty of the Eighteen Articles&lt;/a&gt;, which finalized the Belgo-Dutch border.\nAfter the dissolution of the National Congress in July 1831, Jottrand turned down a further parliamentary career. He believed that he could fight more consistently for his political and social ideas outside parliament.\nFlamingant.\nJottrand was a big supporter of the Dutch language group \"Nederduitsch Tael- en Letterkundig Genootschap\". He supplied half of the starting capital for the &lt;a href=\"Flemish\"&gt;Flemish&lt;/a&gt; newspaper \"Vlaemsch Belgi\u00eb\" in 1844, which he also ended up writing articles for. In 1847 he founded the daily newspaper \"D\u00e9bat Social\". He corresponded with &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Marx\"&gt;Karl Marx&lt;/a&gt;, whose contributions to the \"&lt;a href=\"Neue%20Rheinische%20Zeitung\"&gt;Neue Rheinische Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;\" charmed him. He joined the &lt;a href=\"Social%20liberalism\"&gt;social liberal&lt;/a&gt; theater group \"De Morgenstar\" in 1850 and he supported Jacob Kats in the pursuit of Dutch-language theater in the capital.\nBetween 1855 and 1861 he was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20council\"&gt;Municipal Council&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Saint-Josse-ten-Noode\"&gt;Saint-Josse-ten-Noode&lt;/a&gt;. In 1856 he became the first chairman of the Flemish Grievance Commission, which was founded in that year by King Leopold I. However, the long list of complaints drawn up by the committee was rejected by &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Rogier\"&gt;Charles Rogier&lt;/a&gt; in 1857.\nJottrand was a member of various pro-Flemish pressure groups: from 1858 onwards he was a member of \"Vlamingen Vooruit\" and in 1861. He joined the Central Bureau of \"Vlaemsch Verbond\". In 1872 he called for a unified Flemish electoral list to be submitted for the parliamentary elections. The following year, partly due to his efforts, a Flemish \"country day\" was held in Brussels with at least ten thousand people present. The first Belgian language law, the so-called Equality Law or Coremans Law, was also created under his influence.\nHis son Gustave Jottrand was also a pro-Flemish politician. He was member of the Municipal Council of the &lt;a href=\"city%20of%20Brussels\"&gt;city of Brussels&lt;/a&gt; from 1870 to 1884 and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Representatives%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Chamber of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; from 1870 to 1884.\nPolitical positions.\nJottrand evolved from a Belgian &lt;a href=\"Patriotism\"&gt;Patriot&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Progressivism\"&gt;progressive&lt;/a&gt; democratic &lt;a href=\"flamingant\"&gt;flamingant&lt;/a&gt;. He described himself as a \"Dutch-Walloon\" and held a unique place within the Flemish Movement due to his proposal of a &lt;a href=\"Federalism\"&gt;Federal&lt;/a&gt; Dutch realm that would also encompass &lt;a href=\"Wallonia\"&gt;Wallonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;. This makes him a precursor to the so-called &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Netherlands%20thought%23Pan-Netherlands\"&gt;Burgundist&lt;/a&gt; ideal of &lt;a href=\"Joris%20Van%20Severen\"&gt;Joris van Severen&lt;/a&gt;. Jottrand forms a link in the evolution of the &lt;a href=\"Flemish%20Movement\"&gt;Flemish Movement&lt;/a&gt; from a cultural to a political movement. For him, \"Netherlandic\" was a political concept rather than a linguistic or ethnic concept. Decentralization and equality of the various population groups were of great importance in this respect. Jottrand was a &lt;a href=\"Social%20liberalism\"&gt;progressive liberal&lt;/a&gt; and was in contact with representatives of early &lt;a href=\"socialism\"&gt;socialism&lt;/a&gt;. He was chairman of the Belgian \"Association D\u00e9mocratique\" of which &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Marx\"&gt;Karl Marx&lt;/a&gt; was vice-chairman. He was also a &lt;a href=\"Republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; and advocate for &lt;a href=\"universal%20suffrage\"&gt;universal suffrage&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Association D\u00e9mocratique\".\nThe \"Association D\u00e9mocratique or 'Association D\u00e9mocratique, ayant pour but l'union et la fraternit\u00e9 de tous les peuples\"' (&lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;: Democratic Association, with the goal of union and brotherhood of all peoples) in full, was a &lt;a href=\"Democracy\"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Republicanism\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; political organisation in Belgium. For some time it had its own journal, the \"Deutsche Br\u00fcsseler Zeitung.\"\nThe group was created in 27 September, 1847 in Brussels. Lucien Jottrand along with Karel Spilthoorn belonged to its founding members. Many immigrants joined the organisation like &lt;a href=\"Poles\"&gt;Poles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt;. The group often met up in caf\u00e9 \"De Zwaan\", Brussels. The aim of the movement was to unite all democratic forces in Belgium. Chairman of the organisation was Lucien Jottrand, vice-chairman was &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Marx\"&gt;Karl Marx&lt;/a&gt;. Spilthoorn drew up the constitution of the association. In January 1848 a chapter was founded in Ghent, with Spilthoorn as chairman. \nJottrand wanted to achieve social change through &lt;a href=\"civil%20resistance\"&gt;civil resistance&lt;/a&gt; and stayed away from &lt;a href=\"Labour%20revolt\"&gt;labour revolts&lt;/a&gt;. As a &lt;a href=\"Radicalism%20%28historical%29\"&gt;radical libera&lt;/a&gt;l, he primarily opposed the role of the &lt;a href=\"nobility\"&gt;nobility&lt;/a&gt; in Belgian politics and the &lt;a href=\"Monarchy%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;royal family&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast to the &lt;a href=\"Proletariat\"&gt;proletarian&lt;/a&gt; wing, including &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Engels\"&gt;Friedrich Engels&lt;/a&gt; and Karl Marx, his aim was to lift the working class out of their poverty rather than liberate them from &lt;a href=\"Class%20conflict\"&gt;class struggle&lt;/a&gt; and create a different society. This contradiction briefly led to a split between the two and Marx even canceled his membership of the association. However, the build-up to the &lt;a href=\"revolutions%20of%201848\"&gt;revolutions of 1848&lt;/a&gt; brought them back together. Spilthoorn, as a representative of the \"Association D\u00e9mocratique\", was sent to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; to meet with the Provisional Government during the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution%20of%201848\"&gt;February Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe association was blamed by the Belgian authorities for the attempt to overthrow the Belgian monarchy in 1848. Several members were convicted at the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20assizes%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Court of Assizes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;, including honorary president Fran\u00e7ois Mellinet. 17 members were sentenced to death on August 30, 1848 for conspiracy against the state after which the \"Association D\u00e9mocratique\" fell apart."
