    "text": "This article lists various career, tournament, and seasonal achievements by the Spanish tennis player &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Nadal\"&gt;Rafael Nadal&lt;/a&gt;.\nRafael Nadal has won a record 21 Grand Slam singles titles, more than any other male player in the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20tennis\"&gt;Open Era&lt;/a&gt;. \nNadal has appeared in 29 Grand Slam finals which is third to Federer\u2019s and Djokovic's 31 finals. He has appeared in at least five finals at each major (a feat equaled only by Federer and surpassed only by Djokovic's six) and has won multiple majors on hard, grass, and clay courts, a feat matched by Djokovic at &lt;a href=\"French%20Open\"&gt;French Open&lt;/a&gt; 2021. Nadal completed the Career Grand Slam and the Career Golden Slam, becoming the youngest player in the Open Era to achieve this feat, having won all four majors and the Olympic title by the age of . At the 2022 Australian Open he became the fourth man in history (joining &lt;a href=\"Roy%20Emerson\"&gt;Roy Emerson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rod%20Laver\"&gt;Rod Laver&lt;/a&gt;, and Djokovic) to complete the Double Career Grand Slam, which means winning each Grand Slam title at least two times.\nKnown as the \"\u201cKing of Clay\u201d\", Nadal won the French Open 9 times in his first 10 attempts, and 13 times overall, with a match record of 105\u20133 (97.2% win rate), which is viewed by many analysts as one of the greatest feats in the Open Era. Nadal won the French Open on his first attempt as a 19-year-old in 2005 and went on to win 4 consecutive crowns from 2005 to 2008, defeating then world No. 1 Roger Federer in three consecutive finals from 2006 to 2008 (he also defeated Federer in the 2005 semi-finals) and again in the 2011 final (Nadal is the only player to defeat Federer in four finals at the same major. Nadal is also the only player to beat Federer in the finals of three different grand slams, the French Open, the Australian Open, and Wimbledon). His sole loss at the French Open during this period came at the hands of Sweden's &lt;a href=\"Robin%20S%C3%B6derling\"&gt;Robin S\u00f6derling&lt;/a&gt; in 2009 in the round of 16. Nadal then went on to avenge his loss to S\u00f6derling by defeating him in the 2010 French Open final. He would go on to win 5 consecutive crowns from 2010 to 2014. Rafa furthered his legend in history when he won \"La Decima\", a 10th title in Paris in 2017, where he didn't drop a set and lost only 35 games, only three shy of Borg's record of 32 games lost. He would then win another 4 consecutive crowns from 2017 to 2020, and making Nadal the only player in history, male or female, to win 13 grand slams at a single major (ahead of Djokovic 9 Australian Opens and Federer 8 Wimbledons. The best female is Margaret Court 11 Australian Opens). Additionally, his French Open 2020 win also made Nadal the only player in history to have 3 streaks of 4 consecutive titles at a grand slam event (Borg and Federer each had 2 streaks), as well as 3 streaks of 30+ consecutive match wins at the same event. He has never been taken to five sets in the final, and is the only player to achieve this type of dominance at any single Grand Slam tournament. Additionally, Nadal is 25\u20130 in best of 5 matches on clay at other events, bringing his total match record in best of 5 on clay to 130\u20133, a win percentage of 97.7%. Nadal did not lose a single semifinal on clay courts for 12 years (52\u20130) from the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Croatia%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles\"&gt;2003 Croatia Open&lt;/a&gt; (lost to &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Moya\"&gt;Carlos Moya&lt;/a&gt;) to the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Rio%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles\"&gt;2015 Rio Open&lt;/a&gt; (lost to &lt;a href=\"Fabio%20Fognini\"&gt;Fabio Fognini&lt;/a&gt;).\nNadal has won 36 &lt;a href=\"ATP%20World%20Tour%20Masters%201000\"&gt;Masters 1000&lt;/a&gt; titles. On clay, he has won 26 Masters 1000 titles, 13 Grand Slam titles, and an Open Era record 62 titles. He won at least one Masters 1000 title for ten consecutive years from 2005 to 2014 and is the only player to achieve this type of consistency in the Open Era. He owns the Open era records of most consecutive years of winning 1+ ATP singles titles (18 years from 2004\u20132021) and most consecutive years of winning 2+ ATP singles titles (17 years from 2005\u20132021). He owns the longest single surface win streak by a male having won 81 consecutive matches on clay courts from 2005 to 2007, 16 better than Federer's record on grass, and 25 better than Federer's record on hard courts. Nadal also won a record 8 consecutive Monte Carlo Masters 1000 titles from 2005 to 2012, and a record overall 11 titles including his three-peat from 2016 to 2018. Nadal has also won an all-time record 10 Masters 1000 titles in Rome, and 12 titles at the ATP 500 Barcelona Open. In 2010, Nadal won the French Open plus all three clay court Masters 1000 events (Monte Carlo, Rome, Madrid) in the same calendar year, thus becoming the first, and only, player to complete the \"Clay Slam\".\nNadal won at least one Grand Slam tournament for 10 consecutive years (2005 \u2013 2014) having broken the previous men's record of 8 consecutive years. He holds the record for most titles at 3 ATP Tour levels: ATP500 (Barcelona-12), Masters 1000 (Monte Carlo-11), and Grand Slams (French Open-13).\nNadal\u2019s success is not limited to clay courts. Over the course of his career, he has won 500+ hard court matches as well as 450+ clay court matches. He is the only player, male or female, to have recorded 450+ match wins on both hard and clay courts. He has won 501 matches on hard courts, which is fourth in the Open Era behind only &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Federer\"&gt;Roger Federer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Novak%20Djokovic\"&gt;Novak Djokovic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Andre%20Agassi\"&gt;Andre Agassi&lt;/a&gt;. He has won 6 hard court Grand Slam titles, which ranks him fourth place all-time behind only Djokovic, Federer, and &lt;a href=\"Pete%20Sampras\"&gt;Pete Sampras&lt;/a&gt;. He has achieved considerable success on hard courts and grass courts, obtaining multiple Grand Slams outside of the French Open having won 2 Australian Open (hard), 2 Wimbledon (grass), and 4 US Open (hard) titles. This fact sets Nadal &amp; Djokovic apart from the other Career Grand Slam winners as none of them have won multiple slams on clay, hard, and grass courts (Federer, and Agassi each only have 1 clay slam). Furthermore, Nadal is the second Spaniard to win Wimbledon, and in 2008 he became only the third player in the Open Era, after Rod Laver in 1969 &amp; Bjorn Borg in 1980, to win the French Open and Wimbledon crowns in the same year, also known as the \"Channel Slam\", which he would repeat in 2010 (Federer would join the club in 2009, and Djokovic would later achieve it in 2021). Nadal is the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open. Nadal is the only male player in tennis history to win the French Open and the US Open in the same calendar year four times (2010, 2013, 2017, 2019). Nadal won the Olympic gold medal in singles in Beijing (2008) on hard courts (defeating Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals), the Olympic gold medal in men's doubles in Rio de Janeiro (2016), and has won 10 Masters 1000 titles [spread out over four tournaments. He won 5 Canada, 3 Indian Wells, 1 Cincinnati, 1 Madrid indoor (2005)]. Nadal dominated the North American hard court season in 2013, having already won the Indian Wells title earlier in the year, he would win his first 26 matches on hard courts by winning the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Rogers%20Cup%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Canadian Masters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2013%20Western%20%26amp%3B%20Southern%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles\"&gt;Cincinnati Masters&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"2013%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles\"&gt;US Open&lt;/a&gt;, thus joining &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Rafter\"&gt;Patrick Rafter&lt;/a&gt; (1998) and &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Roddick\"&gt;Andy Roddick&lt;/a&gt; (2003) in completing the \"Summer Slam\" [winning the Canada Masters, Cincinnati Masters, and the US Open in the same calendar year, something only 3 men have accomplished].\nNadal was ATP year-end number 1 in 2008, 2010, 2013, 2017, and 2019, tied for third all-time with Connors and Federer. He is the first man to be year-end number 1 twice after turning 30 years old (2017 and 2019) and one of only 2 men to do so (along with Djokovic - 2018 and 2020). The gap between his first and most recent year-end number 1 is 11 years, another ATP record. He is the first male player to be year-end number 1 in five non-consecutive years. The razor-thin margin between him and the #2 ranked player, Novak Djokovic, in 2013 was 770 ranking points and in 2019 was 840 ranking points.\nNadal also owns the Open Era record of most consecutive years qualifying for the year-end &lt;a href=\"ATP%20Finals\"&gt;ATP Finals&lt;/a&gt; at 16 years in a row. Nadal ranks second in the Open Era for &lt;a href=\"Open%20Era%20tennis%20records%20%E2%80%93%20men%27s%20singles%23All%20tournaments\"&gt;best career winning percentage (minimum 500 wins)&lt;/a&gt; at 83.24% (1038\u2013209 record). He ranks 3rd in the Open Era in total top 10 wins behind Djokovic and Federer. \nNadal is the only player to have been ranked ATP world number one in three decades, in the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.\nGuinness World Records.\nAs of 2021, Nadal holds 18 Guinness World Records.\nWins over No. 1 players.\nNadal holds the solo record for most wins against No. 1-ranked players, 22. With his win in the final of the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Italian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles\"&gt;2019 Italian Open \u2013 Men's Singles&lt;/a&gt; over Djokovic, he broke a long-standing tie with &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Becker\"&gt;Boris Becker&lt;/a&gt;. He recorded 13 wins over &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Federer\"&gt;Roger Federer&lt;/a&gt; and 9 wins over &lt;a href=\"Novak%20Djokovic\"&gt;Novak Djokovic&lt;/a&gt;. Nadal recorded his first win over a No. 1-ranked player when he was only , and ranked No. 34, when he beat Federer in straight sets in the third round of the &lt;a href=\"2004%20NASDAQ-100%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles%23Top%20Half\"&gt;2004 Miami Open&lt;/a&gt;.\nAwards.\nThis is a list of awards Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal has won in his career."
