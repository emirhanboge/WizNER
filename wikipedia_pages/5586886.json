He played in &lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Baseball\"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"outfielder\"&gt;outfielder&lt;/a&gt;, most notably as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Athletics\"&gt;Philadelphia Athletics&lt;/a&gt; dynasty that won three consecutive American League pennants from 1929 to 1931 and won the &lt;a href=\"World%20Series\"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; in 1929 and 1930. He also played for the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%20Browns\"&gt;St. Louis Browns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfter Miller's playing career, he coached in the majors for 17 years.\nBaseball career.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Vinton%2C%20Iowa\"&gt;Vinton, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, Miller debuted in the major leagues on April 16, &lt;a href=\"1921%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1921&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 26 with the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt;, but in &lt;a href=\"1922%20in%20baseball\"&gt;1922&lt;/a&gt; Miller was traded to the &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Athletics\"&gt;Philadelphia Athletics&lt;/a&gt;. \nMiller was the starting &lt;a href=\"right%20fielder\"&gt;right fielder&lt;/a&gt; for the Athletics during their three consecutive &lt;a href=\"American%20League\"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; championships and, was part of one of the most feared &lt;a href=\"Batting%20order%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting orders&lt;/a&gt; in the history of baseball featuring three future &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Baseball Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; members (&lt;a href=\"Al%20Simmons\"&gt;Al Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jimmie%20Foxx\"&gt;Jimmie Foxx&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mickey%20Cochrane\"&gt;Mickey Cochrane&lt;/a&gt;). \nIn &lt;a href=\"1929%20Philadelphia%20Athletics%20season\"&gt;1929&lt;/a&gt;, he hit for a .331 batting average with 93 runs batted in and a career-high .380 &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt; to help the Athletics win their first American League pennant in 15 years by 18 games over the vaunted &lt;a href=\"1929%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season\"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Babe%20Ruth\"&gt;Babe Ruth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lou%20Gehrig\"&gt;Lou Gehrig&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of six Athletics players to post batting averages above .310 during the 1929 season. He went on to produce a .368 batting average in the &lt;a href=\"1929%20World%20Series\"&gt;1929 World Series&lt;/a&gt; including a &lt;a href=\"out%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;two-out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"walk-off%20home%20run\"&gt;walk-off&lt;/a&gt; double in the bottom of the ninth &lt;a href=\"inning%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt; in Game 5 to clinch the World Series championship for the Athletics over the &lt;a href=\"1929%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season\"&gt;Chicago Cubs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1930%20Philadelphia%20Athletics%20season\"&gt;1930&lt;/a&gt; Miller hit for a .303 batting average with 9 home runs and a career-high 100 runs batted in as the Athletics repeated as American League champions and defeated the &lt;a href=\"1929%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season\"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1930%20World%20Series\"&gt;1930 World Series&lt;/a&gt;. The Athletics won their third consecutive American League championship in &lt;a href=\"1931%20Philadelphia%20Athletics%20season\"&gt;1931&lt;/a&gt; but, were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Pepper%20Martin\"&gt;Pepper Martin&lt;/a&gt;-led St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series. \nMiller's offensive output began to diminish at the same time that owner &lt;a href=\"Connie%20Mack\"&gt;Connie Mack&lt;/a&gt; began to dismantle the team. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Depression\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; was well under way, and declining attendance had drastically reduced the Athletic's revenues. Mack sold or traded his best players in order to reduce expenses and, by &lt;a href=\"1934%20Philadelphia%20Athletics%20season\"&gt;1934&lt;/a&gt; the team had fallen to fifth place. \nOn January 14, 1935, Miller was released by the Athletics and the following day signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox. He played in his final Major League game on September 5, 1936 at the age of 42. He was released by the Red Sox on September 27, 1936.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a sixteen-year major league career, Miller played in 1,820 &lt;a href=\"Games%20played\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;, accumulating 1,934 &lt;a href=\"Hit%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;hits&lt;/a&gt; in 6,212 &lt;a href=\"at%20bats\"&gt;at bats&lt;/a&gt; for a .311 career &lt;a href=\"batting%20average%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;batting average&lt;/a&gt;, along with 946 &lt;a href=\"run%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt;, 389 &lt;a href=\"double%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubles&lt;/a&gt;, 96 &lt;a href=\"triple%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;triples&lt;/a&gt;, 116 &lt;a href=\"home%20runs\"&gt;home runs&lt;/a&gt;, 993 &lt;a href=\"runs%20batted%20in\"&gt;runs batted in&lt;/a&gt;, 127 &lt;a href=\"stolen%20bases\"&gt;stolen bases&lt;/a&gt;, 383 &lt;a href=\"bases%20on%20balls\"&gt;bases on balls&lt;/a&gt;, .359 &lt;a href=\"on-base%20percentage\"&gt;on-base percentage&lt;/a&gt; and .461 &lt;a href=\"slugging%20percentage\"&gt;slugging percentage&lt;/a&gt;.

Taken to Presbyterian Hospital in Philadelphia, he died six hours after the accident.\nHis younger brother &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Miller%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29\"&gt;Ralph Miller&lt;/a&gt; played in one Major League game for the &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29\"&gt;Washington Senators&lt;/a&gt; in 1921."
