    "text": "Mallana (15th century) was a &lt;a href=\"Telugu%20language\"&gt;Telugu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"poet\"&gt;poet&lt;/a&gt; and one of the \"&lt;a href=\"Astadiggajas\"&gt;Astadiggajas&lt;/a&gt;\" (literally means eight elephants) in the &lt;a href=\"noble%20court\"&gt;court&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"monarch\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Krishnadevaraya\"&gt;Krishnadevaraya&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nHe said that his birthplace was part of &lt;a href=\"Rayalaseema\"&gt;Rayalaseema&lt;/a&gt; (means land ruled by Rayas, &lt;a href=\"Vijayanagara\"&gt;Vijayanagara&lt;/a&gt; kings) in his works. He accompanied Krishnadevaraya in his military travels. He dedicated his work to Nadendla Appana (popularly known as Appaji), the governor of &lt;a href=\"Kondavidu\"&gt;Kondavidu&lt;/a&gt; and nephew of a Minister called Saluava Timmana in the &lt;a href=\"Vijayanagara%20Empire\"&gt;Vijayanagara Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorks.\nHis popular work is \"Rajasekara Charitram\" on the military and romantic conquests of Rajasekara, a king of &lt;a href=\"Avanti%20%28India%29\"&gt;Avanti&lt;/a&gt;.\nStyle.\nLike other poets of Prabhanda (fiction) period, his story seems completely original and there is no &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; equivalent to it. Compared to his contemporaries, he is restrained in presenting romance."
