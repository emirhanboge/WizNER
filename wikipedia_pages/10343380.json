    "text": "Subaie' (, also spelled Alsubaie', Sbei', and Subei) is an &lt;a href=\"Arabian\"&gt;Arabian&lt;/a&gt; surname of central &lt;a href=\"Saudi%20Arabia\"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe family is of North Arabian (&lt;a href=\"Adnanite\"&gt;Adnanite&lt;/a&gt;) stock, and traces its lineage to the large, ancient tribe of &lt;a href=\"Banu%20%27Amir\"&gt;Banu 'Amir&lt;/a&gt;, also known as 'Amir ibn Sa'sa'a, who came to dominate &lt;a href=\"Nejd\"&gt;Nejd&lt;/a&gt; in the medieval period. Al-Subaies were Prophet Mohammed's knights. Also, they were the knights of Saudi 1, Saudi 2, and The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia until now.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, they comprised both nomadic (\"&lt;a href=\"bedouin\"&gt;bedouin&lt;/a&gt;\") and sedentary sections. \nThe original grazing lands of the family's bedouins had been the region of &lt;a href=\"Ranyah\"&gt;Ranyah&lt;/a&gt; and Kurmah, on the border between Nejd and &lt;a href=\"%27Asir\"&gt;'Asir&lt;/a&gt;. They ended up roaming the areas of central Nejd around &lt;a href=\"Riyadh\"&gt;Riyadh&lt;/a&gt;, along with the closely related family of the &lt;a href=\"Suhool\"&gt;Suhool&lt;/a&gt;. Some sections, though, moved further north, where they later established the town of Rumah. Today, they are mostly found in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait.\nThe sedentary members, on the other hand, have mostly resided in central Arabia for centuries, a possible legacy of Banu 'Amir's heyday. Families that belong to Subay' can be found in practically every town in the region, making up a disproportionate amount of central Arabia's traditional sedentary population.\nDemographics.\nSubaie's population is nearly 5.000.000-7.000.000 people all around central and north of the Arabian Peninsula, located in the Middle East."
