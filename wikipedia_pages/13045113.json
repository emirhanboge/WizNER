    "text": "William George \"Twit\" Tasker (15 October 1891 \u2013 9 August 1918) was an Australian &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; soldier who had been a national representative &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player making six Test appearances for the &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Wallabies&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nThe third son of David Henry Tasker (-1920), and Helene Tasker (-1912), William George Tasker was born in &lt;a href=\"Condobolin%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Condobolin, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; on 15 October 1891.\nTasker attended &lt;a href=\"Newington%20College\"&gt;Newington College&lt;/a&gt; from (1906\u20131911). He captained the Newington First XV in 1911 and was selected in and captained the &lt;a href=\"GPS%20Schools\"&gt;GPS Schools&lt;/a&gt; representative 1st XV in 1911. He stayed in Sydney after completing his schooling becoming a bank clerk whilst pursuing a rugby career.\nRugby career.\nHe debuted for the Newtown Rugby Club in Sydney in 1912 and that same year at age 20 he captained the club's first-grade side.\nHe was selected in the &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Australia national rugby union squad&lt;/a&gt; which toured North America in 1912; although he did not play a Test. The squad was overwhelmed with hospitality and lacking strong management they reveled in the social life and undergraduate antics of the college fraternity houses in which they were billeted. In what must be the worst record of any Australian touring team, the squad lost all of their Canadian matches among five defeats.\nTasker was the first-ever Wallaby to be sent from the field. An incident occurred on the 1912 tour of the United States when Tasker's rough play upset an American referee.\nTasker made his Test debut at &lt;a href=\"Athletic%20Park%20%28Wellington%29\"&gt;Athletic Park (Wellington)&lt;/a&gt; on the 1913 tour of &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and played in all three Tests of that tour. The following year he made three further Test appearances when the &lt;a href=\"All%20Blacks\"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; toured Australia in a return series.\nWar service.\nTasker enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force\"&gt;AIF&lt;/a&gt; in January 1915, a Gunner in the 12th Field Artillery Brigade, &lt;a href=\"13th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;13th Battalion (Australia)&lt;/a&gt;. He took part in the &lt;a href=\"Landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove\"&gt;Landing at Anzac Cove&lt;/a&gt;, landing late on 25 April 1915. From May to August, the 13th battalion was heavily involved in establishing and defending the ANZAC front lines.\nTasker was severely wounded at Quinn's Post at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Gallipoli\"&gt;Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt; with shell fragment damage to his legs and ankle. He was invalided back to Australia. A rugby colleague also at Gallipoli, H.A Mitchell of the &lt;a href=\"Manly%20RUFC\"&gt;Manly Club&lt;/a&gt; wrote home of Tasker's injuries \"A bomb loaded up Tasker's leg and ankle up with about 17 pieces of shot. It will be sometime before he can do any of that sidestepping he used to do\".\nIn 1916 he re-enlisted with the 116th Howitzer Battery and he again embarked from Sydney on board \"HMAT A60 Aeneas\" on 30 September. He saw further action on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; and was twice wounded.\nDeath.\nOn 9 August 1918, Tasker was working with his artillery gun sights at &lt;a href=\"Harbonnieres\"&gt;Harbonnieres&lt;/a&gt; on the second day of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29\"&gt;Battle of Amiens&lt;/a&gt; when a shell landed near the gun, mortally wounding him in the groin with &lt;a href=\"Shrapnel%20%28fragment%29\"&gt;shrapnel&lt;/a&gt;. He died later that day at the age of 26.\nHe is buried at the Villers-Bretonneux Military Cemetery.\nThe sporting journal \"The Referee\" reported: \nIn the same issue, the sporting journalist, \"The Rambler\", made these comments:"
