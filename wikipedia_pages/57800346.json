    "text": "This is an incomplete list of &lt;a href=\"dolmens\"&gt;dolmens&lt;/a&gt;, a type of single-chamber &lt;a href=\"megalithic\"&gt;megalithic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tomb\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt;. 40% of the world's dolmens are found in Korea. Dolmens are also found in Europe, especially Northern France and the British Isles.\nDolmen sites.\nAsia.\nCaucasus.\nOver 3,000 dolmens and other structures can be found in the North-Western &lt;a href=\"Caucasus\"&gt;Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; region in Russia, where more and more dolmens are discovered in the mountains each year. These dolmens are related to the &lt;a href=\"Maykop%20culture\"&gt;Maykop culture&lt;/a&gt;. This great city of dolmens was built along the shores of the Black Sea from Maykop down to Sochi. The inhabitants were metal workers. The dolmens were vaults or safes of stone, with a narrow circular entrance that could be tapped with a round screw of stone. Supposedly the dolmens were used to hide and protect metal objects: gold, silver, bronze, jewels and some other treasure. Trade of these objects was done with Persia, Assyria, Egypt and Crete. The Dolmen City was pillaged and sacked by &lt;a href=\"Scythian\"&gt;Scythian&lt;/a&gt; invaders in the early first millennium BC. The metal workers were enslaved.\nChina.\nA &lt;a href=\"Dolmens%20on%20the%20Upper%20Reaches%20of%20the%20Huifa%20River\"&gt;large group of dolmens along the Huifa River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jilin\"&gt;Jilin&lt;/a&gt; Province were listed as a &lt;a href=\"Major%20Historical%20and%20Cultural%20Site%20Protected%20at%20the%20National%20Level\"&gt;Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level&lt;/a&gt; in 2006. The dolmens have been dated to the fifth century &lt;a href=\"BCE\"&gt;BCE&lt;/a&gt; and total more than 80. They are linked to similar monuments found on the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Peninsula\"&gt;Korean Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Liao%20River\"&gt;Liao River&lt;/a&gt; basin.\nIndia.\nList of dolmens in India, from north to south, is.\nKorea.\nKorean dolmens exhibit a morphology distinct from the Atlantic European dolmen. The largest concentration of dolmens in the world is found on the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Peninsula\"&gt;Korean Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. With an estimated 35,000 dolmens, Korea alone accounts for nearly 40% of the world\u2019s total. The largest distribution of these is on the west coast area of &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, an area that would eventually become host to the &lt;a href=\"Mahan%20confederacy\"&gt;Mahan confederacy&lt;/a&gt; and be united under the rule of the ancient kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Baekje\"&gt;Baekje&lt;/a&gt; at one time.\nThree specific &lt;a href=\"UNESCO%20World%20Heritage\"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage&lt;/a&gt; sites at &lt;a href=\"Gochang%2C%20Hwasun%20and%20Ganghwa%20Dolmen%20Sites\"&gt;Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa&lt;/a&gt; ( Hwasun \u2013 ) by themselves account for over 1,000 dolmens.\nThe Korean word for dolmen is goindol () \"supported stone\". Serious studies of the Korean megalithic monuments were not undertaken until relatively recently, well after much research had already been conducted on dolmens in other regions of the world. Since 1945, new research has been conducted by Korean scholars. In 1981 a curator of &lt;a href=\"National%20Museum%20of%20Korea\"&gt;National Museum of Korea&lt;/a&gt;, Gon'gil Ji, classified Korean dolmens into two general types: northern and southern.\nThe boundary between them falls at the &lt;a href=\"Bukhan%20River\"&gt;Bukhan River&lt;/a&gt; although examples of both types are found on either side. Northern style dolmens stand above ground with a four sided chamber and a megalithic roof (also referred to as \"table type\"), while southern style dolmens are normally built into the ground and contain a stone chest or pit covered by a rock slab.\nKorean dolmens can also be divided into three main types: the table type, the go-table type and the unsupported capstone type. The dolmen in &lt;a href=\"Ganghwa%20Island\"&gt;Ganghwa&lt;/a&gt; is a northern-type, table-shaped dolmen and is the biggest stone of this kind in South Korea, measuring . There are many sub-types and different styles. Southern type dolmens are associated with burials but the reason for building northern style dolmens is uncertain.\nDue to the vast numbers and great variation in styles, no absolute chronology of Korean dolmens has yet been established. It is generally accepted that the Korean megalithic culture emerged from the late &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; age, during which agriculture developed on the peninsula, and flourished throughout the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Age\"&gt;Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt;. Some dolmens depict astronomical formations, dated up to 3000 B.C. effectively the first star-chart in the world. How and why Korea has produced so many dolmens are still poorly understood. There is no current conclusive theory on the origin of Korea's megalithic culture, and so it is difficult to determine the true cultural character of Korean dolmens. Some dolmens are also found in &lt;a href=\"Manchuria\"&gt;Manchuria&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shandong%20Peninsula\"&gt;Shandong Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Off the peninsula, similar specimens can be found in smaller numbers, but they are often considerably larger than the Korean dolmens. It is a mystery why this culture flourished so extensively only on the Korean peninsula and its vicinity in &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Asia\"&gt;Northeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;.\nMiddle East.\nDolmens can be found in Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, and Jordan. Numerous large dolmens are in the Israeli National park at &lt;a href=\"Gamla\"&gt;Gamla&lt;/a&gt; and some of dolmens can be viewed in the &lt;a href=\"meshkin%20shahr\"&gt;meshkin shahr&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"shahr%20yeri\"&gt;shahr yeri&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"pirazmian\"&gt;pirazmian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are many examples of flint dolmens in the historical villages of &lt;a href=\"Johfiyeh\"&gt;Johfiyeh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Natifah\"&gt;Natifah&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Jordan\"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. The greatest number of dolmens are around &lt;a href=\"Madaba\"&gt;Madaba&lt;/a&gt;, like the ones at Al Faiha village, to the west of Madaba city. Two dolmens are in Hisbone, and the most have been found at Zarqa Ma'in at &lt;a href=\"Al-Murayghat\"&gt;Al-Murayghat&lt;/a&gt;, which are being destroyed by gravel quarries.\nAfrica.\nHorn of Africa.\nIn northern &lt;a href=\"Somalia\"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Aw Barkhadle is surrounded by a number of ancient structures. Among these are dolmens, burial mounds, &lt;a href=\"menhir\"&gt;menhir&lt;/a&gt;s (standing stones), and &lt;a href=\"stela\"&gt;stela&lt;/a&gt;e.\nNorth Africa.\nIn northern &lt;a href=\"Tunisia\"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dougga\"&gt;Dougga&lt;/a&gt; is an important ancient site, which contains a &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; with dolmens. The settlement also features a sanctuary dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Baal%23Ba%27al%20of%20Carthage\"&gt;Ba'al Hammon&lt;/a&gt;, neo-Punic stelae, the mausoleum, architectural fragments, and a temple dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Masinissa\"&gt;Masinissa&lt;/a&gt;, the remains of which were found during archaeological excavations.\nEurope.\nOverview.\n&lt;a href=\"Megalithic\"&gt;Megalithic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tomb\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt;s are found from the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; coasts south to Spain and Portugal. Hunebedden are &lt;a href=\"chamber%20tomb\"&gt;chamber tomb&lt;/a&gt;s similar to dolmens and date to the middle &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Funnelbeaker%20culture\"&gt;Funnelbeaker culture&lt;/a&gt;, 4th millennium BC). They consist of a &lt;a href=\"Megalithic%20architectural%20elements\"&gt;kerb&lt;/a&gt; surrounding an &lt;a href=\"Oval%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;oval&lt;/a&gt; mound, which covered a &lt;a href=\"rectangle\"&gt;rectangular&lt;/a&gt; chamber of stones with the entrance on one of the long sides. Some have a more complex layout and include an entrance passage giving them a T-shape. Various &lt;a href=\"menhir\"&gt;menhir&lt;/a&gt;s and dolmens are located around the Mediterranean islands of &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gozo\"&gt;Gozo&lt;/a&gt;. Pottery uncovered in these structures allowed the attribution of the monuments to the &lt;a href=\"%C4%A0gantija\"&gt;\u0120gantija&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mnajdra\"&gt;Mnajdra&lt;/a&gt; temples culture of the early Neolithic Age.\nDolmen sites fringe the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Sea\"&gt;Irish Sea&lt;/a&gt; and are found in south-east &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devon\"&gt;Devon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cornwall\"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;. In Ireland, most dolmens are found on the west coast, particularly in &lt;a href=\"Connemara\"&gt;Connemara&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Burren\"&gt;Burren&lt;/a&gt;, which includes some of the better-known examples, such as &lt;a href=\"Poulnabrone%20dolmen\"&gt;Poulnabrone dolmen&lt;/a&gt;. Examples such as the &lt;a href=\"Annadorn%20Dolmen\"&gt;Annadorn dolmen&lt;/a&gt; have also been found in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, where they may have co-existed with the &lt;a href=\"court%20cairn\"&gt;court cairn&lt;/a&gt; tombs.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Mecklenburg\"&gt;Mecklenburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pomerania\"&gt;Pomerania&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Pomorze\"&gt;Pomorze&lt;/a&gt; in Germany and Poland, and in &lt;a href=\"Drenthe\"&gt;Drenthe&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands, large numbers of these graves were disturbed when harbours, towns, and cities were built. The boulders were used in construction and road building. Others, such as the &lt;a href=\"Harhoog\"&gt;Harhoog&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Sylt\"&gt;Sylt&lt;/a&gt;, were moved to new locations. There are still many thousands left today in Europe.\nBy 2017, all the \"hunebedden\" in the Netherlands were put in a 3D atlas (accessible to the public for free) using &lt;a href=\"photogrammetry\"&gt;photogrammetry&lt;/a&gt;. The data was obtained from a collaboration between the Province of Drenthe and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Groningen\"&gt;University of Groningen&lt;/a&gt;, subsidized by the Gratama Foundation.\nIn Turkey, there are some dolmens in the Regions of Lalapasa and Suloglu in the Province of &lt;a href=\"Edirne\"&gt;Edirne&lt;/a&gt; and the Regions of Kof\u00e7az, K\u0131rklareli and Demirk\u00f6y in the Province of &lt;a href=\"K%C4%B1rklareli\"&gt;K\u0131rklareli&lt;/a&gt;, in the Eastern Thrace. They have been studied by Prof. Dr. Engin Beksa\u00e7, since 2004. And also, some of so-called monuments are in the different regions of Anatolia, in Turkey."
