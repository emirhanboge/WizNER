    "text": "David Hay (born 29 January 1948) is a Scottish former &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player and &lt;a href=\"manager%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;. He broke into the &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; team in the late 1960s, as one of a generation of players who continued a highly successful era for the club. A contract dispute between Hay and Celtic led to him being transferred to &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; in 1974. He played in over 100 league games for Chelsea, but was forced to retire in 1979 due to a detached retina. Hay appeared in 27 international matches for &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, and was selected for their &lt;a href=\"1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1974 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; squad.\nAfter retiring as a player, Hay entered football management with &lt;a href=\"Motherwell%20F.C.\"&gt;Motherwell&lt;/a&gt; in 1981. He led them to a promotion in &lt;a href=\"1981%E2%80%9382%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;1981\u201382&lt;/a&gt;, but left the club at the end of the season. He was then appointed Celtic manager in 1983, and enjoyed some success as they won the &lt;a href=\"1984%E2%80%9385%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;1984\u201385 Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20Scottish%20football%20champions\"&gt;Scottish league championship&lt;/a&gt; in 1985\u201386. In the 1990s he returned to Celtic as Chief Scout and later Assistant General manager.\nHay also won the &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20Norwegian%20football%20league%20champions\"&gt;Norwegian league championship&lt;/a&gt; during a brief stint with &lt;a href=\"Lillestr%C3%B8m%20SK\"&gt;Lillestr\u00f8m SK&lt;/a&gt;. He subsequently worked for &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Livingston%20F.C.\"&gt;Livingston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunfermline%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Dunfermline Athletic&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlaying career.\nAfter completing his secondary education at &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirin%27s%20Academy\"&gt;St Mirin's Academy&lt;/a&gt; in Paisley, Hay signed for &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; in 1966. He became one of the \"&lt;a href=\"Quality%20Street%20Gang%20%28Celtic%20F.C.%29\"&gt;Quality Street Gang&lt;/a&gt;\" reserve team which eventually took the places of the ageing &lt;a href=\"Lisbon%20Lions\"&gt;Lisbon Lions&lt;/a&gt;. He made his league debut on 6 March 1968 against Aberdeen going on to make 230 appearances for Celtic scoring 12 goals, winning 5 League Championships, 3 Scottish Cups and 1 League Cup. After playing for &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1974 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in West Germany, and following a dispute with Celtic, he was transferred to &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; for a club record \u00a3225,000. Initially signed as a direct replacement for Alan Hudson in midfield, he adopted a more defensive role in the young Chelsea side that emerged following their relegation a year later. In 1979 a serious knee injury forced him to retire from the game as a player. He had also suffered problems with a &lt;a href=\"detached%20retina\"&gt;detached retina&lt;/a&gt; and eventually lost full vision in his right eye. He won a total 27 caps for Scotland.\nManagement career.\nMotherwell.\nHis first venture into football management was when he took over the reins at &lt;a href=\"Motherwell%20F.C.\"&gt;Motherwell&lt;/a&gt; in 1981 following &lt;a href=\"Ally%20MacLeod\"&gt;Ally MacLeod&lt;/a&gt;. He led Well to the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20First%20Division\"&gt;Scottish First Division&lt;/a&gt; title and promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;Scottish Premier Division&lt;/a&gt;. He left at the end of the 1981-82 season.\nCeltic.\nHay succeeded &lt;a href=\"Billy%20McNeill\"&gt;Billy McNeill&lt;/a&gt; as Celtic manager in 1983, winning the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1984%E2%80%9385%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;Premier Division&lt;/a&gt; in dramatic fashion in &lt;a href=\"1985%E2%80%9386%20Scottish%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;. Celtic won their final game 5\u20130 against &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt; at Love Street but needed &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hearts&lt;/a&gt;, who were league leaders and favourites to lift the trophy, to lose to &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dens%20Park\"&gt;Dens Park&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Kidd\"&gt;Albert Kidd&lt;/a&gt; secured the victory for Dundee with two goals and Celtic were crowned champions. After Celtic failed to win a trophy in &lt;a href=\"1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;1986\u201387&lt;/a&gt;, Hay left Celtic. He was asked to resign, but refused, so he was sacked and was replaced by McNeill.\nLillestrom SK.\nIn 1989, Hay ventured to Norway and led &lt;a href=\"Lillestrom%20SK\"&gt;Lillestrom SK&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Norwegian Premier League&lt;/a&gt; championship.\nSt Mirren.\nIn 1991, Hay took on Paisley club &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt; but left a year later.\nReturn to Celtic.\nHay became chief scout at Celtic in 1994, and was responsible for identifying players such as &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Cadete\"&gt;Jorge Cadete&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20di%20Canio\"&gt;Paolo di Canio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20van%20Hooijdonk\"&gt;Pierre van Hooijdonk&lt;/a&gt; who signed for the club. He became Assistant General manager to &lt;a href=\"Jock%20Brown\"&gt;Jock Brown&lt;/a&gt; in 1997, but left in 1998 in acrimonious circumstances.\nLivingston.\nHay teamed up with &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Leishman\"&gt;Jim Leishman&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 as co-managers of &lt;a href=\"Livingston%20F.C.\"&gt;Livingston&lt;/a&gt;, and led the club to the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20First%20Division\"&gt;Scottish First Division&lt;/a&gt; title at the end of 2000-01, and the club's first promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Scottish Premier League&lt;/a&gt;. Their debut season in the top flight in 2001-02 earned them their first qualification into Europe with a &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; place. The 2002-03 season was less impressive and they both stepped down from the management position, although they both stayed at the club. Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Marcio%20Maximo\"&gt;Marcio Maximo Barcellos&lt;/a&gt; took over.\nHay returned to the manager's job shortly into 2003-04 season, this time in sole charge, taking over from Marcio Maximo after just 9 games of the season. Hay went on to win the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish League Cup&lt;/a&gt; while the club was in administration, beating heavy favourites &lt;a href=\"Hibernian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hibernian&lt;/a&gt; (who beat &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; en route to the final). Despite this success, the veteran boss was released at the end of the season to be replaced by &lt;a href=\"Allan%20Preston\"&gt;Allan Preston&lt;/a&gt;, one of his first team coaches, by new chairman, Pearse Flynn of the Lionheart Consortium.\nDunfermline Athletic.\nHay was then appointed manager of &lt;a href=\"Dunfermline%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Dunfermline Athletic&lt;/a&gt;, succeeding &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Calderwood\"&gt;Jimmy Calderwood&lt;/a&gt;. He rejoined with &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Leishman\"&gt;Jim Leishman&lt;/a&gt; who was the Fife club's &lt;a href=\"Director%20of%20Football\"&gt;Director of Football&lt;/a&gt;. He was sacked near the end of the season with the club struggling in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Scottish Premier League&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter management.\nHay rejoined &lt;a href=\"Livingston%20FC\"&gt;Livingston&lt;/a&gt; on 16 June 2008 in an advisory role. He briefly became interim manager in 2009 after &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Hegarty\"&gt;Paul Hegarty&lt;/a&gt; was suspended by the club.\nIn 2015 Hay returned to Celtic as a director of the Celtic Pools, which raises money for the youth academy. He has also worked in a business development role for New College Lanarkshire."
