    "text": "The National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST, formerly \"Regional Research Laboratory, &lt;a href=\"Thiruvananthapuram\"&gt;Trivandrum&lt;/a&gt;\") is a constituent laboratory of &lt;a href=\"CSIR%20India\"&gt;CSIR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, engaged in research and development activities in the field of agroprocessing and technology, microbial processes and technology, chemical sciences and technology, material sciences and technology and process engineering and environmental technology. Around approximately 80 scientists and 300 research fellows are working in various scientific disciplines in this institute. The programmes have a blend of basic research, technology development and commercialization; have specific thrusts on frontier areas of research, National Mission Projects, regional resource-based activities and R &amp; D - Industry - Academia linkages. The laboratory has excellent collaborative programmes with major National &amp; International agencies too. the present director of the institute is Dr. A. Ajayaghosh.\nIt was established in 1975 as a &lt;a href=\"CSIR%20India\"&gt;CSIR&lt;/a&gt; Complex, then named as the Regional Research Laboratory in 1978 and later renamed as NIIST in 2007.\nResearch divisions.\nThe major research divisions in NIIST are:&lt;br&gt;\n1. Agroprocessing and technology division (APTD)\n2. Microbial processes and technology division (MPTD)\n3. Chemical sciences and technology division (CSTD)\n4. Materials science and technology division (MSTD)\n5. Environmental technology division\nMaterials Science and Technology division has divided into Functional Materials and Minerals and Metallic Materials sections.\nFunctional Materials has activities related to nano-ceramics, energy materials, polymeric materials, electronic materials and magnetic materials. \nMinerals and Metallic Materials has activities related to metals and minerals.\nAgroprocessing division.\nThis is the division in charge of undertaking research in developing innovative technologies for processing of oil seeds, spices and natural products. The core competence of the division is in process and product development and on the transformation of such processes into fully engineered technology packages for commercial exploitation. The division has set up a number of commercial plants in many states and extended technical expertise in making policy decisions in relevant areas by governmental and non governmental agencies. Technology Business Incubation Centre (TBIC) in the area of spices and natural products contribute towards development of innovative technologies. Major research includes quality improvement of palm oil, spice oil/ oleoresins, swing technology for processing of fresh and dry spices, Refrigeration Adsorption Dehumidified Drying (RADD) of heat sensitive materials, Ginger oil extraction, and nutraceutical studies."
