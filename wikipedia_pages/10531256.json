    "text": "Sahak II or Isaac II, last name Khabayan () (March 25, 1849 \u2013 October 8, 1939), was &lt;a href=\"Catholicos%20of%20Cilicia\"&gt;Catholicos of Cilicia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20Apostolic%20Church\"&gt;Armenian Apostolic Church&lt;/a&gt; in 1902\u20131939.\nBorn in the village of Yeghiki in &lt;a href=\"Harput\"&gt;Kharpert&lt;/a&gt;, he received his religious training in &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. He was Catholicos of Cilicia during the tumultuous years of the &lt;a href=\"Armenian%20genocide\"&gt;Armenian genocide&lt;/a&gt;, and was first exiled from the &lt;a href=\"Episcopal%20see\"&gt;see&lt;/a&gt;'s seat in &lt;a href=\"Kozan%2C%20Adana\"&gt;Sis&lt;/a&gt;, and then again after relocating to &lt;a href=\"Adana\"&gt;Adana&lt;/a&gt;. From 1921 the Catholicos wandered the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; from place to place with no permanent home.\nBy 1929, aged 80 and weary, Catholicos Sahak appealed for help to the &lt;a href=\"Near%20East\"&gt;Near East&lt;/a&gt; Relief organization, which had built several &lt;a href=\"orphanage\"&gt;orphanage&lt;/a&gt;s for orphaned Armenian children fleeing the genocide. One of these orphanages was in the town of &lt;a href=\"Antelias\"&gt;Antelias&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Beirut\"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, which they leased to the Catholicos for one dollar a year. Sahak also sought to bring his dream for an Armenian &lt;a href=\"theological%20seminary\"&gt;theological seminary&lt;/a&gt; to life at this site, since all &lt;a href=\"seminaries\"&gt;seminaries&lt;/a&gt; under his jurisdiction had been closed or fallen apart after the genocide.\nDue to his advanced age, Sahak II encouraged the election of a co-adjutor Catholicos to share his throne. &lt;a href=\"Papken%20I%20Guleserian\"&gt;Papken I Guleserian&lt;/a&gt; reigned along with Sahak from 1931 until his death in 1936. Sahak II lived on another three years until his death at age 90."
