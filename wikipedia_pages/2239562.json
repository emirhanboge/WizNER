    "text": "The T'ang String Quartet (\u5510\u56db\u91cd\u594f) is a &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;-based classical &lt;a href=\"Strings%20%28music%29\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; quartet that has played to critical acclaim.\nBiography.\nThe T\u2019ang String Quartet comprises Ng Yu-Ying (1st &lt;a href=\"violin\"&gt;violin&lt;/a&gt;), Ang Chek Meng (2nd violin), Lionel Tan (&lt;a href=\"viola\"&gt;viola&lt;/a&gt;) and Leslie Tan (&lt;a href=\"cello\"&gt;cello&lt;/a&gt;). The Tang Quartet was formed in 1992 when the members were still performers with &lt;a href=\"Singapore%20Symphony%20Orchestra\"&gt;Singapore Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;. Trained individually in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, the Quartet was awarded a fellowship to work in the USA with Paul and Martha Katz, Norman Fischer, Kenneth Goldsmith and Sergui Luca at the &lt;a href=\"Shepherd%20School%20of%20Music\"&gt;Shepherd School of Music&lt;/a&gt;. After a two-year masters studies in &lt;a href=\"Rice%20University\"&gt;Rice University&lt;/a&gt; as a pre-formed quartet, the T\u2019ang Quartet started their professional career in 1999 with unanimity of purpose: to break new ground by extending the sheer fun and enjoyment of classical music to a larger audience, as well as setting new standards of artistic achievement.\nCritics have praised the T\u2019ang Quartet as 'astounding' for its 'confidence', bravura and charisma' (Boston Globe) and for bringing \u2018enthusiasm, energy and commitment...to all the music...' (The Times, London). They have added that 'this ensemble is outstanding. Unanimity of attack is uncanny, and intonation and internal balance both impress greatly. These are plainly minds which share a wavelength' (Evening Standard, London).\nApart from recitals the Quartet is also very active in outreach and art education programmes. The T\u2019ang Quartet is currently the quartet-in-residence at the &lt;a href=\"Yong%20Siew%20Toh%20Conservatory%20of%20Music\"&gt;Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"National%20University%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;National University of Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and was on the faculty of the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20University%20Tanglewood%20Institute\"&gt;Boston University Tanglewood Institute&lt;/a&gt; from 2001 to 2005.\nIn September 2006, it was accorded the prestigious honour of performing at the opening of Singapore Biennale, and to foreign dignitaries at the IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings held in Singapore. ASEAN Summit in 2007\n\"T'ang\" signifies that golden age of the arts in Asia \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20dynasty\"&gt;T'ang Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The name is also an &lt;a href=\"acronym\"&gt;acronym&lt;/a&gt; of the players' last names \u2013 Ng, Ang and Tan.\nIn 2007, T'ang Quartet premiered \"Optical Identity\", a collaborative production with Theatre Cryptic (Scotland) was commissioned by the Singapore Arts Festival. The European premiere took place at the Edinburgh International Festival in August, and the production then traveled to the Alicante International Contemporary Music Festival (Spain) in September, and tours Scotland in October and November 2007.\nT'ang Quartet was invited to perform Azerbaijan composer Franghiz Ali Zadeh's Mugam Sayagi at a UNESCO award Ceremony in Paris on 3 April 2008, where she was receiving the honorary title of UNESCO Artist for Peace.\nMembers of T'ang Quartet play instruments on generous loan from the Rin Collection and Mr Jiri Heger."
