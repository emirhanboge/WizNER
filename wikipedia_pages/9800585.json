    "text": "The Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) was a Nigerian political party that was dominant in western Nigeria during the second republic (1978-1983). The party revolved around the &lt;a href=\"political\"&gt;political&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"leadership\"&gt;leadership&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Obafemi%20Awolowo\"&gt;Obafemi Awolowo&lt;/a&gt;, a sometimes polemical politician but effective administrator. However, the party's main difference with its competitors was not the leader but the ideals of a social democracy it was founded on. The UPN inherited its ideology from the old &lt;a href=\"Action%20Group%20%28Nigeria%29\"&gt;Action Group&lt;/a&gt; and saw itself as a party for everyone. It was the only party to promote free education and called itself a welfarist party.\nThe desired goal of the military government of &lt;a href=\"Olusegun%20Obasanjo\"&gt;Olusegun Obasanjo&lt;/a&gt; to build national political parties led to a gradual weakening of ethnic politics in the second republic. The UPN as well as the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Redemption%20Party\"&gt;People's Redemption Party&lt;/a&gt; (PRP) presented the most coherent plan of action during the electioneering campaign of 1979. The party jettisoned building a coalition of comfort in a polarized political environment but based partnerships on the cooperation of like minded advocates of &lt;a href=\"democratic%20socialism\"&gt;democratic socialism&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Action%20Congress%20of%20Nigeria\"&gt;Action Congress of Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; was regarded as a natural successor to the Action Group and UPN.\nReferences.\nChief Obafemi Awolowo"
