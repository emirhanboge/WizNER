    "title": "Glycogen phosphorylase",
    "text": "Glycogen phosphorylase is one of the &lt;a href=\"phosphorylase\"&gt;phosphorylase&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"enzyme\"&gt;enzyme&lt;/a&gt;s (). Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in &lt;a href=\"glycogenolysis\"&gt;glycogenolysis&lt;/a&gt; in animals by releasing &lt;a href=\"glucose-1-phosphate\"&gt;glucose-1-phosphate&lt;/a&gt; from the terminal alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond. Glycogen phosphorylase is also studied as a model protein regulated by both reversible &lt;a href=\"phosphorylation\"&gt;phosphorylation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Allosteric%20regulation\"&gt;allosteric&lt;/a&gt; effects.\nMechanism.\nGlycogen phosphorylase breaks up &lt;a href=\"glycogen\"&gt;glycogen&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"glucose\"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Protein%20subunit\"&gt;subunits&lt;/a&gt; (see also figure below):\n(\u03b1-1,4 glycogen chain)n + &lt;a href=\"Phosphate\"&gt;Pi&lt;/a&gt; \u21cc (\u03b1-1,4 glycogen chain)n-1 + \u03b1-D-glucose-1-phosphate.\nGlycogen is left with one fewer glucose &lt;a href=\"molecule\"&gt;molecule&lt;/a&gt;, and the free glucose molecule is in the form of &lt;a href=\"glucose-1-phosphate\"&gt;glucose-1-phosphate&lt;/a&gt;. In order to be used for &lt;a href=\"metabolism\"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, it must be converted to &lt;a href=\"glucose-6-phosphate\"&gt;glucose-6-phosphate&lt;/a&gt; by the enzyme &lt;a href=\"phosphoglucomutase\"&gt;phosphoglucomutase&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the reaction is reversible &lt;a href=\"in%20vitro\"&gt;in vitro&lt;/a&gt;, within the cell the enzyme only works in the forward direction as shown below because the concentration of &lt;a href=\"Phosphate\"&gt;inorganic phosphate&lt;/a&gt; is much higher than that of glucose-1-phosphate.\nGlycogen phosphorylase can act only on &lt;a href=\"linear\"&gt;linear&lt;/a&gt; chains of glycogen (\u03b11-4 glycosidic linkage). Its work will immediately come to a halt four residues away from \u03b11-6 &lt;a href=\"Branching%20%28polymer%20chemistry%29\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt; (which are exceedingly common in glycogen). In these situations, the &lt;a href=\"glycogen%20debranching%20enzyme\"&gt;debranching enzyme&lt;/a&gt; is necessary, which will straighten out the chain in that area. In addition, the enzyme transferase shifts a block of 3 glucosyl residues from the outer branch to the other end, and then a &lt;a href=\"glycogen%20debranching%20enzyme\"&gt;\u03b11-6 glucosidase&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"enzyme\"&gt;enzyme&lt;/a&gt; is required to break the remaining (single glucose) \u03b11-6 residue that remains in the new linear chain. After all this is done, glycogen phosphorylase can continue. The enzyme is specific to \u03b11-4 chains, as the molecule contains a 30-angstrom-long crevice with the same radius as the helix formed by the glycogen chain; this accommodates 4-5 glucosyl residues, but is too narrow for branches. This crevice connects the glycogen storage site to the active, catalytic site.\nGlycogen phosphorylase has a &lt;a href=\"pyridoxal%20phosphate\"&gt;pyridoxal phosphate&lt;/a&gt; (PLP, derived from &lt;a href=\"Vitamin%20B6\"&gt;Vitamin B6&lt;/a&gt;) at each catalytic site. Pyridoxal phosphate links with basic residues (in this case Lys680) and covalently forms a &lt;a href=\"Schiff%20base\"&gt;Schiff base&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Schiff base linkage is formed, holding the PLP molecule in the active site, the phosphate group on the PLP readily donates a proton to an inorganic phosphate molecule, allowing the inorganic phosphate to in turn be deprotonated by the oxygen forming the \u03b1-1,4 glycosidic linkage. PLP is readily deprotonated because its negative charge is not only stabilized within the phosphate group, but also in the pyridine ring, thus the conjugate base resulting from the deprotonation of PLP is quite stable. The protonated oxygen now represents a good &lt;a href=\"leaving%20group\"&gt;leaving group&lt;/a&gt;, and the glycogen chain is separated from the terminal glycogen in an &lt;a href=\"SN1%20reaction\"&gt;SN1&lt;/a&gt; fashion, resulting in the formation of a glucose molecule with a secondary carbocation at the 1 position. Finally, the deprotonated inorganic phosphate acts as a &lt;a href=\"nucleophile\"&gt;nucleophile&lt;/a&gt; and bonds with the carbocation, resulting in the formation of glucose-1-phosphate and a glycogen chain shortened by one glucose molecule.\nThere is also an alternative proposed mechanism involving a positively charged oxygen in a half-chair conformation.\nStructure.\nThe glycogen phosphorylase monomer is a large protein, composed of 842 amino acids with a mass of 97.434 &lt;a href=\"kDa\"&gt;kDa&lt;/a&gt; in muscle cells. While the enzyme can exist as an inactive monomer or tetramer, it is biologically active as a &lt;a href=\"protein%20dimer\"&gt;dimer&lt;/a&gt; of two identical subunits.\nIn mammals, the major &lt;a href=\"isozyme\"&gt;isozyme&lt;/a&gt;s of glycogen phosphorylase are found in muscle, liver, and brain. The brain type is predominant in adult brain and embryonic tissues, whereas the liver and muscle types are predominant in adult liver and skeletal muscle, respectively.\nThe glycogen phosphorylase dimer has many regions of biological significance, including &lt;a href=\"catalytic\"&gt;catalytic&lt;/a&gt; sites, glycogen binding sites, &lt;a href=\"allosteric\"&gt;allosteric&lt;/a&gt; sites, and a reversibly phosphorylated serine residue. First, the catalytic sites are relatively buried, 15\u00c5 from the surface of the protein and from the subunit interface. This lack of easy access of the catalytic site to the surface is significant in that it makes the protein activity highly susceptible to regulation, as small allosteric effects could greatly increase the relative access of glycogen to the site.\nPerhaps the most important &lt;a href=\"regulatory%20site\"&gt;regulatory site&lt;/a&gt; is Ser14, the site of reversible &lt;a href=\"phosphorylation\"&gt;phosphorylation&lt;/a&gt; very close to the subunit interface. The structural change associated with phosphorylation, and with the conversion of phosphorylase b to phosphorylase a, is the arrangement of the originally disordered residues 10 to 22 into \u03b1 helices. This change increases phosphorylase activity up to 25% even in the absence of AMP, and enhances AMP activation further.\nThe allosteric site of &lt;a href=\"Adenosine%20monophosphate\"&gt;AMP&lt;/a&gt; binding on muscle isoforms of glycogen phosphorylase are close to the subunit interface just like Ser14. Binding of AMP at this site, corresponding in a change from the T state of the enzyme to the R state, results in small changes in tertiary structure at the subunit interface leading to large changes in quaternary structure. AMP binding rotates the tower helices (residues 262-278) of the two subunits 50\u02da relative to one another through greater organization and intersubunit interactions. This rotation of the tower helices leads to a rotation of the two subunits by 10\u02da relative to one another, and more importantly disorders residues 282-286 (the 280s loop) that block access to the catalytic site in the T state but do not in the R state.\nThe final, perhaps most curious site on the glycogen phosphorylase protein is the so-called glycogen storage site. Residues 397-437 form this structure, which allows the protein to covalently bind to the glycogen chain a full 30 \u00c5 from the catalytic site . This site is most likely the site at which the enzyme binds to glycogen granules before initiating cleavage of terminal glucose molecules. In fact, 70% of dimeric phosphorylase in the cell exists as bound to glycogen granules rather than free floating.\nClinical significance.\nThe inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase has been proposed as one method for treating &lt;a href=\"type%202%20diabetes\"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Since glucose production in the liver has been shown to increase in type 2 diabetes patients, inhibiting the release of glucose from the liver's glycogen's supplies appears to be a valid approach. The cloning of the human liver glycogen phosphorylase (HLGP) revealed a new allosteric binding site near the subunit interface that is not present in the rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase (RMGP) normally used in studies. This site was not sensitive to the same inhibitors as those at the AMP allosteric site, and most success has been had synthesizing new inhibitors that mimic the structure of glucose, since &lt;a href=\"glucose-6-phosphate\"&gt;glucose-6-phosphate&lt;/a&gt; is a known inhibitor of HLGP and stabilizes the less active T-state. These glucose derivatives have had some success in inhibiting HLGP, with predicted Ki values as low as 0.016 mM.\nMutations in the muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase (PYGM) are associated with &lt;a href=\"glycogen%20storage%20disease%20type%20V\"&gt;glycogen storage disease type V&lt;/a&gt; (GSD V, McArdle's Disease). More than 65 mutations in the PYGM gene that lead to McArdle disease have been identified to date. Symptoms of McArdle disease include muscle weakness, &lt;a href=\"myalgia\"&gt;myalgia&lt;/a&gt;, and lack of endurance, all stemming from low glucose levels in muscle tissue.\nMutations in the liver isoform of glycogen phosphorylase (PYGL) are associated with &lt;a href=\"Hers%27%20Disease\"&gt;Hers' Disease&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"glycogen%20storage%20disease%20type%20VI\"&gt;glycogen storage disease type VI&lt;/a&gt;). Hers' disease is often associated with mild symptoms normally limited to &lt;a href=\"hypoglycemia\"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/a&gt;, and is sometimes difficult to diagnose due to residual enzyme activity.\nThe brain isoform of glycogen phosphorylase (PYGB) has been proposed as a &lt;a href=\"biomarker\"&gt;biomarker&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"stomach%20cancer\"&gt;gastric cancer&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegulation.\nGlycogen phosphorylase is regulated through &lt;a href=\"allosteric\"&gt;allosteric&lt;/a&gt; control and through &lt;a href=\"phosphorylation\"&gt;phosphorylation&lt;/a&gt;. Phosphorylase a and phosphorylase b each exist in two forms a T (tense) inactive state and R (relaxed) state. Phosphorylase b is normally in the T state, inactive due to the physiological presence of ATP and Glucose 6 phosphate, and Phosphorylase a is normally in the R state (active). An isoenzyme of glycogen phosphorylase exists in the liver sensitive to glucose concentration, as the liver acts as a glucose exporter. In essence, liver phosphorylase is responsive to glucose, which causes a very responsive transition from the R to T form, inactivating it; furthermore, liver phosphorylase is insensitive to AMP.\nHormones such as &lt;a href=\"epinephrine\"&gt;epinephrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"insulin\"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"glucagon\"&gt;glucagon&lt;/a&gt; regulate glycogen phosphorylase using second messenger amplification systems linked to &lt;a href=\"G%20proteins\"&gt;G proteins&lt;/a&gt;. Glucagon activates adenylate cyclase through a &lt;a href=\"G%20protein-coupled%20receptor\"&gt;G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)&lt;/a&gt; coupled to &lt;a href=\"Heterotrimeric%20G%20protein\"&gt;Gs&lt;/a&gt; which in turn activates &lt;a href=\"adenylate%20cyclase\"&gt;adenylate cyclase&lt;/a&gt; to increase intracellular concentrations of cAMP. cAMP binds to and activates &lt;a href=\"protein%20kinase%20A\"&gt;protein kinase A&lt;/a&gt; (PKA). PKA phosphorylates &lt;a href=\"phosphorylase%20kinase\"&gt;phosphorylase kinase&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase b at Ser14, converting it into the active glycogen phosphorylase a.\nIn the liver, &lt;a href=\"glucagon\"&gt;glucagon&lt;/a&gt; also activates another GPCR that triggers a different cascade, resulting in the activation of phospholipase C (PLC). PLC indirectly causes the release of calcium from the hepatocytes' endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. The increased calcium availability binds to the &lt;a href=\"calmodulin\"&gt;calmodulin&lt;/a&gt; subunit and activates glycogen phosphorylase kinase. Glycogen phosphorylase kinase activates glycogen phosphorylase in the same manner mentioned previously.\nGlycogen phosphorylase b is not always inactive in muscle, as it can be activated allosterically by AMP. An increase in AMP concentration, which occurs during strenuous exercise, signals energy demand. AMP activates glycogen phosphorylase b by changing its conformation from a tense to a relaxed form. This relaxed form has similar enzymatic properties as the phosphorylated enzyme. An increase in ATP concentration opposes this activation by displacing AMP from the nucleotide binding site, indicating sufficient energy stores.\nUpon eating a meal, there is a release of &lt;a href=\"insulin\"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, signaling glucose availability in the blood. Insulin indirectly activates &lt;a href=\"Protein%20phosphatase%201\"&gt;protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"phosphodiesterase\"&gt;phosphodiesterase&lt;/a&gt; via a signal transduction cascade. PP1 dephosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase a, reforming the inactive glycogen phosphorylase b. The phosphodiesterase converts cAMP to AMP. Together, they decrease the concentration of cAMP and inhibit PKA. As a result, PKA can no longer initiate the phosphorylation cascade that ends with formation of (active) glycogen phosphorylase a. Overall, insulin signaling decreases glycogenolysis to preserve glycogen stores in the cell and triggers &lt;a href=\"glycogenesis\"&gt;glycogenesis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistorical significance.\nGlycogen phosphorylase was the first allosteric enzyme to be discovered. It was isolated and its activity characterized in detail by &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Cori\"&gt;Carl F. Cori&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gerhard%20Schmidt%28biochemist%29\"&gt;Gerhard Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gerty%20Cori\"&gt;Gerty T. Cory&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Arda%20Green\"&gt;Arda Green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gerty%20Cori\"&gt;Gerty Cori&lt;/a&gt; crystallized it for the first time in 1943 and illustrated that glycogen phosphorylase existed in either the or b forms depending on its phosphorylation state, as well as in the R or T states based on the presence of AMP."
