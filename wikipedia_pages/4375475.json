    "text": "Clann \u00c9ireann (; ), also known as the People's Party, was a minor &lt;a href=\"Irish%20republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; political party in the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt;. The party was founded on 25 January 1926 as a result of a split from the ruling &lt;a href=\"Cumann%20na%20nGaedheal\"&gt;Cumann na nGaedheal&lt;/a&gt; party, to protest against the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Boundary%20Commission\"&gt;Boundary Commission&lt;/a&gt; report, which permanently demarcated the border between the Free State and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. Clann \u00c9ireann was the leading representative of constitutional republicanism in &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A1il%20%C3%89ireann\"&gt;D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann&lt;/a&gt; until the success of &lt;a href=\"Fianna%20F%C3%A1il\"&gt;Fianna F\u00e1il&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"June%201927%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;June 1927 general election&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party chairman was Professor &lt;a href=\"William%20Magennis\"&gt;William Magennis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teachta%20D%C3%A1la\"&gt;Teachta D\u00e1la&lt;/a&gt; (TD) for &lt;a href=\"National%20University%20of%20Ireland%20%28constituency%29\"&gt;National University of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The secretaries included &lt;a href=\"P%C3%A1draic%20%C3%93%20M%C3%A1ille\"&gt;P\u00e1draic \u00d3 M\u00e1ille&lt;/a&gt; TD for Galway. Other prominent members of the party included &lt;a href=\"Maurice%20George%20Moore\"&gt;Maurice George Moore&lt;/a&gt;, who at the time was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Seanad%20%C3%89ireann%20%28Irish%20Free%20State%29\"&gt;senate&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Byrne%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Christopher Byrne&lt;/a&gt;, who was a sitting TD for Wicklow who was one of those who had resigned from Cumann na nGaedheal over the Boundary issue.\nThe party demanded for Ireland \"one and indivisible as of right the full status of a sovereign State. We aim at restoring the unity of her territory and the union of all her people under one central supreme government\". The party advocated the abolition of the &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20Allegiance%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Oath of Allegiance&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Monarchy%20in%20the%20Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;British King&lt;/a&gt;. It also called for lower taxes and less legislation. In policies like trade &lt;a href=\"protectionism\"&gt;protectionism&lt;/a&gt; and the abolition of the Oath of Allegiance, it agreed with the agenda of &lt;a href=\"Sinn%20F%C3%A9in\"&gt;Sinn F\u00e9in&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"%C3%89amon%20de%20Valera\"&gt;\u00c9amon de Valera&lt;/a&gt;. An attempt to lure de Valera and his followers into the party failed. After de Valera created the Fianna F\u00e1il party in March 1926, Clann \u00c9ireann grew closer to that group.\nThe party attracted little support and it failed to win any seats in &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A1il%20%C3%89ireann\"&gt;D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"June%201927%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;June 1927 general election&lt;/a&gt;. Its seven candidates only attracted a few thousand first preference votes. Seven of them were last in their constituencies and forfeited their deposits. On 28 August 1927, the party issued a statement supporting Fianna F\u00e1il, and ceased political activity."
