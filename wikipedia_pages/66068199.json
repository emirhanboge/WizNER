    "text": "Blue Mesa Summit (elevation ) is a mountain pass in &lt;a href=\"Gunnison%20County%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Gunnison County&lt;/a&gt; of west-central &lt;a href=\"Colorado\"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. The pass is traversed by &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2050\"&gt;U.S. Route 50&lt;/a&gt; and divides the watersheds of &lt;a href=\"Little%20Cimarron%20River\"&gt;Little Cimarron River&lt;/a&gt; to the west and &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Creek%20%28Gunnison%20River%20tributary%29\"&gt;Blue Creek&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nHistory.\nBlue Mesa Summit had long been used by &lt;a href=\"Ute%20People\"&gt;Utes&lt;/a&gt;, trappers, and explorers who were traveling between the &lt;a href=\"Gunnison%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Gunnison Valley&lt;/a&gt; to the east and the &lt;a href=\"Uncompahgre%20Valley\"&gt;Uncompahgre Valley&lt;/a&gt; to the west. By the mid-1870s, mining in the San Juan Mountains resulted in the construction of trails and wagon roads connecting the increasing number of new mining camps and growing towns. Road builder &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Mears\"&gt;Otto Mears&lt;/a&gt; had constructed the Saguache and San Juan Toll Road connecting the towns of &lt;a href=\"Saguache%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Saguache&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20City%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Lake City&lt;/a&gt; in 1874. Needed was a road connecting this route to the mining town of &lt;a href=\"Ouray%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Ouray&lt;/a&gt; to the west. Mears\u2019 new Lake Fork and Uncompahgre Toll Road was opened in 1878, and it followed the established trail over Blue Mesa Summit.\nIn the 1930s, the newly designated &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2050%20in%20Colorado\"&gt;U.S. Route 50&lt;/a&gt; was routed over Blue Mesa Summit and the location follows closely the historic toll road over the pass."
