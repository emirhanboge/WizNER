    "text": "William Bell (1 May 1806 \u2013 4 August 1844) was a businessman and militia officer from &lt;a href=\"Perth%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Canada\"&gt;Upper Canada&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilliam Bell had a twin brother, John and was the son of &lt;a href=\"William%20Bell%20%28clergyman%29\"&gt;William Bell&lt;/a&gt;, a Presbyterian missionary, who had arrived in Perth from Scotland in 1817.\nWilliam and his brother both apprenticed in the mercantile trade before forming a partnership and opening a store at Perth in 1828. They also opened a store at Carleton Place with another brother, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Bell%20%28Lanark%20County%20politician%29\"&gt;Robert&lt;/a&gt;. The aggressive merchandising style at the Perth store caused ill feelings amongst their competition. The most notable reaction was from &lt;a href=\"William%20Morris%20%28Canadian%20businessman%29\"&gt;William Morris&lt;/a&gt; with whom William had been apprenticed. The bad feeling ultimately divided Perth's Presbyterian congregation where their father was the minister."
