    "text": "The order Pilosa is a &lt;a href=\"clade\"&gt;clade&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Xenarthra\"&gt;xenarthran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"placental\"&gt;placental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mammal\"&gt;mammal&lt;/a&gt;s, native to the Americas. It includes the &lt;a href=\"anteater\"&gt;anteater&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sloth\"&gt;sloth&lt;/a&gt;s, including the extinct &lt;a href=\"ground%20sloth\"&gt;ground sloth&lt;/a&gt;s, which became extinct about 10,000 years ago. The name comes from the &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; word for \"hairy\".\nOrigins and taxonomy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Biogeography\"&gt;biogeographic origins&lt;/a&gt; of the Pilosa are still unclear, but they can be traced back in &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt; as far as the early &lt;a href=\"Paleogene\"&gt;Paleogene&lt;/a&gt; (about 60 million years ago, only a short time after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Mesozoic%20Era\"&gt;Mesozoic Era&lt;/a&gt;). The presence of these animals in &lt;a href=\"Central%20America\"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt; and their former presence in &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; is a result of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20American%20Interchange\"&gt;Great American Interchange&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pilosans%20of%20the%20Caribbean\"&gt;A number of sloths&lt;/a&gt; were also formerly present on the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Antilles\"&gt;Antilles&lt;/a&gt;, which they reached from South America by some combination of &lt;a href=\"oceanic%20dispersal\"&gt;rafting or floating&lt;/a&gt; with the prevailing currents.\nTogether with the &lt;a href=\"armadillo\"&gt;armadillo&lt;/a&gt;s, which are in the order Cingulata, pilosans are part of the larger superorder &lt;a href=\"Xenarthra\"&gt;Xenarthra&lt;/a&gt;, a defining characteristic of which is the presence of xenarthrals (extra formations between &lt;a href=\"lumbar%20vertebrae\"&gt;lumbar vertebrae&lt;/a&gt;). In the past, Pilosa was regarded as a suborder of the order Xenarthra, while some more recent classifications regard Pilosa as an order within the superorder Xenarthra. Earlier still, both armadillos and pilosans were classified together with &lt;a href=\"pangolin\"&gt;pangolin&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"aardvark\"&gt;aardvark&lt;/a&gt; as the order &lt;a href=\"Edentata\"&gt;Edentata&lt;/a&gt; (meaning toothless, because the members do not have front incisor teeth or molars, or have poorly developed molars). Edentata was subsequently realized to be &lt;a href=\"polyphyletic\"&gt;polyphyletic&lt;/a&gt;; it contained unrelated families and was thus invalid.\nClassification.\nTaxonomy.\nOrder Pilosa\nPhylogeny.\nMajor families within Pilosa\nCladogram of living Pilosa"
