She then entered merchant service as SS \"West Hosokie\". \nIn 1928, \"West Hosokie\" was acquired by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Steamship%20Company\"&gt;Los Angeles Steamship Company&lt;/a&gt;, renamed SS \"Constance Chandler, and placed into service as a coastal freighter on the &lt;a href=\"west%20coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;west coast&lt;/a&gt; of the United States. By 1930 she was operating for the &lt;a href=\"Matson%20Line\"&gt;Matson Line&lt;/a&gt;, participating in the &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; trade between the U.S. and &lt;a href=\"Honolulu%2C%20Hawaii\"&gt;Honolulu, Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;. She was renamed SS \"Liloa in 1938.\nIn 1944, \"Liloa\" was turned over to the Soviet Union and renamed SS \"Belorussia\". \"Belorussia\" was scrapped in 1960. \nConstruction and design.\n\"West Hosokie\" was built in &lt;a href=\"Seattle%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/a&gt; in 1918 at the No. 1 Plant of the &lt;a href=\"Skinner%20%26amp%3B%20Eddy%20Corporation\"&gt;Skinner &amp; Eddy Corporation&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the 14th in a series of 24 &lt;a href=\"Design%201013%20ship\"&gt;Design 1013&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cargo%20ship\"&gt;cargo ship&lt;/a&gt;s built by Skinner &amp; Eddy for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Shipping%20Board\"&gt;USSB&lt;/a&gt;s emergency wartime shipbuilding program. The ship was laid down on June 11, launched 54 working (65 calendar) days later on 15 August and completed on 29 August\u2014a total time under construction of 65 working (79 calendar) days, putting \"West Hosokie\" into the record books as the fourth-fastest built seagoing ship of the war, and the second fastest ship (behind sister ship \"West Lianga\") of more than 5,500 &lt;a href=\"deadweight%20ton\"&gt;deadweight ton&lt;/a&gt;s. \n\"West Hosokie\" had a design deadweight tonnage of 8,800 tons and &lt;a href=\"gross%20register%20tonnage\"&gt;gross register tonnage&lt;/a&gt; of 5,600. She had an overall length of 423 feet 9\u00a0inches, a beam of 54 feet and a mean draft of 24 feet. The ship was powered by a Curtis geared &lt;a href=\"steam%20turbine\"&gt;turbine&lt;/a&gt;, driving a single screw propeller and delivering a speed of 11.5 &lt;a href=\"knot%20%28unit%29\"&gt;knots&lt;/a&gt;.\nService history.\nU.S. Navy service, 1918-19.\nUpon delivery to the Navy on 29 August, \"West Hosokie\" was commissioned the same day for operation with the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Overseas%20Transportation%20Service\"&gt;Naval Overseas Transportation Service&lt;/a&gt; (NOTS) as USS \"West Hosokie\" (ID-3695), Lt. Comdr. Charles A. Wilson, &lt;a href=\"USNRF\"&gt;USNRF&lt;/a&gt;, in command.\nUSS \"West Hosokie\" commenced her first voyage for the Navy on September 7, when she sailed for &lt;a href=\"Arica%2C%20Chile\"&gt;Arica, Chile&lt;/a&gt; to load a cargo of &lt;a href=\"guano\"&gt;guano&lt;/a&gt;, which was duly delivered to &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana\"&gt;New Orleans, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; on 12 November\u2014the day after &lt;a href=\"Armistice%20Day\"&gt;Armistice Day&lt;/a&gt;. On 20 November \"West Hosokie\" departed for &lt;a href=\"Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Newport News, Virginia&lt;/a&gt; to load a cargo of Army supplies earmarked for delivery to the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Army\"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; in France. She then proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Baltimore\"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; to load some additional cargo before departing for France on 15 December.\nAfter arriving at &lt;a href=\"Le%20Verdon-sur-Mer\"&gt;Le Verdon-sur-Mer&lt;/a&gt;, France, \"West Hosokie\" unloaded her cargo and shipped an Army return cargo bound for &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, United States, departing 14 February 1919. Pausing briefly at the &lt;a href=\"Azores\"&gt;Azores&lt;/a&gt; for provisions and fuel, \"West Hosokie\" continued on to Philadelphia, where she arrived 10 March. After discharging her cargo, the ship departed for New York, where more Army supplies bound for France were loaded prior to her departure once again on 10 April.\nArriving at &lt;a href=\"St.%20Nazaire\"&gt;St. Nazaire&lt;/a&gt;, \"West Hosokie\" discharged her cargo and loaded Army &lt;a href=\"Ammunition%23Ordnance%20ammunition\"&gt;ordnance&lt;/a&gt; materials for the return journey to the U.S. Crossing the Atlantic once more, \"West Hosokie\" reached Newport News on 20 June. She was simultaneously decommissioned, struck from the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Vessel%20Register\"&gt;Navy List&lt;/a&gt; and returned to control of the U.S. Shipping Board on 2 July 1919.\nMerchant service.\nFollowing her Naval decommission, \"West Hosokie\" was placed into merchant service by the USSB as SS \"West Hosokie\". Little is known about the ship's movements in the early 1920s, but she made a voyage from &lt;a href=\"Antwerp%2C%20Belgium\"&gt;Antwerp, Belgium&lt;/a&gt; to New York in August 1920, suggesting she may have been engaged in transatlantic service.\nOn April 26, 1929, \"West Hosokie\" was purchased from the USSB by the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Steamship%20Company\"&gt;Los Angeles Steamship Company&lt;/a&gt; (LASSCO), and placed into service as a coastal freighter on the &lt;a href=\"west%20coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;west coast&lt;/a&gt; of the United States. Renamed SS \"Constance Chandler\" after the socialite daughter of LASSCOs founder, &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Chandler\"&gt;Harry Chandler&lt;/a&gt;, the ship would maintain a steady service well into the 1930s between west coast ports such as &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Seattle%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/a&gt;; and Los Angeles, San Francisco and &lt;a href=\"Balboa%20Peninsula%2C%20Newport%20Beach%2C%20California\"&gt;Balboa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. She also made numerous voyages via the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal\"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt; (where she sometimes ported at &lt;a href=\"Col%C3%B3n%2C%20Panama\"&gt;Col\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;) to east coast destinations including &lt;a href=\"Savannah%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Savannah, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jacksonville%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Jacksonville, Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baltimore%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Baltimore, Maryland&lt;/a&gt; and New York. \nIn 1930, LASSCO was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Matson%20Line\"&gt;Matson Line&lt;/a&gt;, which maintained \"Constance Chandler\" on her existing routes. On 10 July 1932, about 50 miles off &lt;a href=\"Cristobal%2C%20Panama\"&gt;Cristobal, Panama&lt;/a&gt;, \"Constance Chandler\" caught fire in one of her cargo holds. The fire burned for 15 hours before being brought under control, after which the ship was towed 20 miles to port for repairs. Almost a year later, on 9 June 1933, the ship suffered a collision with the steamer \"Andrea\" off the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Gate\"&gt;Golden Gate&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco. \"Constance Chandler\" escaped serious damage in the accident and was able to renew service a few days later. By 1934, in addition to her existing operations, \"Constance Chandler\" had begun making regular trips for the Matson Line to &lt;a href=\"Honolulu%2C%20Hawaii\"&gt;Honolulu, Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, transporting &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; from the island's plantations to the &lt;a href=\"continental%20United%20States\"&gt;continental&lt;/a&gt; United States.\nIn 1938, \"Constance Chandler\" was renamed SS \"Liloa\", but continued to work for the Matson Line in her usual capacity. After America's entry into World War II in December 1941, no more information about the ship's movements appears in contemporary newspaper records, presumably because of a news blackout, but one of the ship's last recorded journeys was a voyage from Hawaii to Australia in January 1941 to pick up a cargo of &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder Soviet Union flag.\nOn 13 January 1945, \"Liloa\" was sold to the Soviet Union, renamed SS \"Belorussia\" and commissioned to the &lt;a href=\"Far%20East%20Shipping%20Company\"&gt;Far East State Shipping Company&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; the ship was used for export and import carriages between Union ports and allies ports in Pacific Ocean. The ship was mentioned as a transport ship in &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean%20Fleet\"&gt;Soviet Union Pasific Ocean Navy Fleet&lt;/a&gt; list from 9 of August to 3rd of September 1945.\nShe was transferred to the balance of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea%20Shipping%20Company\"&gt;Black Sea State Shipping Company&lt;/a&gt; on 9 of June 1947. She was decommissioned, deleted from the ship's lists of Ministry of Maritime fleet of the USSR on 11 of April 1962 and transferred to \"Glavvtorchermet\" (Main organization for the Second use of Black Metals, - Mainsecondblackmet) for dismantling and scrapping. The ship was scrapped in 1968."
