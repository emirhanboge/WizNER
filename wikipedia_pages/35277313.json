    "text": "Woodlands Redoubt, also known as one of the two Twydall Redoubts, was constructed in 1888. It was not included in the original list of defensive structures proposed by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Commission%20on%20the%20Defence%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in 1860, but was conceived later and implemented as an experimental redoubt as opposed to a more substantial fort.\nIn conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Grange%20Redoubt\"&gt;Grange Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; its function was to defend &lt;a href=\"Chatham%20Dockyard\"&gt;Chatham Dockyard&lt;/a&gt; against landward attack from the east."
