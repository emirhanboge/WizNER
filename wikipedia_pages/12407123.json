    "text": "McLemore Avenue is a 1970 album by &lt;a href=\"Booker%20T.%20%26amp%3B%20the%20M.G.s\"&gt;Booker T. &amp; the M.G.s&lt;/a&gt;, consisting entirely of mostly instrumental &lt;a href=\"cover%20version\"&gt;covers&lt;/a&gt; of songs from &lt;a href=\"The%20Beatles\"&gt;the Beatles'&lt;/a&gt; album \"&lt;a href=\"Abbey%20Road\"&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/a&gt;\" (released only months earlier, in September 1969). The title and cover are an homage to the Beatles album, 926 East McLemore Avenue being the address of the &lt;a href=\"Stax%20Museum\"&gt;Stax Studios&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Memphis%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Memphis&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20Road%2C%20London\"&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/a&gt; was for &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s &lt;a href=\"EMI%20Studios\"&gt;EMI Studios&lt;/a&gt;, which were soon renamed Abbey Road Studios. As a nod to \"Abbey Road's\" climactic medley, most of the M.G.s' selections are arranged into their own medleys (with the exception of \"&lt;a href=\"Something%20%28Beatles%20song%29\"&gt;Something&lt;/a&gt;\", which was released as a single and reached number 76 in the US).\n&lt;a href=\"Booker%20T.%20Jones\"&gt;Booker T. Jones&lt;/a&gt; said, \"I was in California when I heard \"Abbey Road\", and I thought it was incredibly courageous of The Beatles to drop their format and move out musically like they did. To push the limit like that and reinvent themselves when they had no need to do that. They were the top band in the world but they still reinvented themselves. The music was just incredible so I felt I needed to pay tribute to it.\"\nTrack listing.\nAll songs written by &lt;a href=\"Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney\"&gt;Lennon\u2013McCartney&lt;/a&gt; except \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\", by &lt;a href=\"George%20Harrison\"&gt;George Harrison&lt;/a&gt;\n2011 Stax Remasters bonus tracks.\nIt was also released digitally in a lossless and high quality version at 88.2 &lt;a href=\"kHz\"&gt;kHz&lt;/a&gt; and 24 bit."
