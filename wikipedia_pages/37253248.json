The team also didn't commit an error in their first seven games (for 64 2/3 innings) for the first time in team history. On September 22, the Royals won their 82nd game of the season, to clinch their 2nd winning season since 1994 and first since 2003.\nOffseason and spring training.\nDuring the offseason, the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Royals\"&gt;Kansas City Royals&lt;/a&gt; donated over $4 million in funds raised during the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;2012 All-Star game&lt;/a&gt; for various projects in the &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Metropolitan%20Area\"&gt;Kansas City area&lt;/a&gt; communities, including building two baseball facilities for disabled children.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp%3Fymd%3D20121120%26amp%3Bcontent_id%3D40387188%26amp%3Bc_id%3Dkc\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http%3A//kansascity.royals.mlb.com/news/print.jsp%3Fymd%3D20130328%26amp%3Bcontent_id%3D43432926%26amp%3Bc_id%3Dkc\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Alex%20Gordon\"&gt;Alex Gordon&lt;/a&gt; signed a $37.5 million four-year deal last season with the Royals.

The Royals finished with a Cactus League-leading .335 batting average and 230 runs.\nAfter improving their starting rotation, the Royals were considered a \"sleeper team\" entering the 2013 season.

After both teams had a day off, players, managers and coaches for both teams &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Robinson%20Day\"&gt;wore No. 42 on their jerseys&lt;/a&gt; to honor &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Robinson\"&gt;Jackie Robinson&lt;/a&gt;.

Chris Getz, KC's No. 8 hitter, homered for the first time in nearly four years (on July 19, 2009 when he played for the Chicago White Sox). &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Francoeur\"&gt;Jeff Francoeur&lt;/a&gt;, a former Braves RF, played his first game at &lt;a href=\"Turner%20Field\"&gt;Turner Field&lt;/a&gt; with Kansas City.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap%3FgameId%3D330416115\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; With &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Davis%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Wade Davis&lt;/a&gt; pitching 7 scoreless innings, the Royals beat the Braves 1\u20130 on April 17 to end &lt;a href=\"2013%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season%23Season%20highlights\"&gt;Atlanta's 10-game winning streak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap%3FgameId%3D330417115%26amp%3Bteams%3Dkansas-city-royals-vs-atlanta-braves\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Royals had a scheduled weekend series against the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Red%20Sox\"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; between April 19\u201321.

However, the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Boston\"&gt;Greater Boston&lt;/a&gt; area went on a citywide &lt;a href=\"lockdown\"&gt;lockdown&lt;/a&gt; in search of a suspect on the morning of April 19.

Following an emotional pregame ceremony, both teams honored the victims of the bombing tragedy by wearing special uniforms/logos. (The Red Sox wore white home jerseys with \"Boston\" on the front instead of the customary \"Red Sox\" while Kansas City players and staff wore a \"B Strong\" patch on the front of their jerseys, with the shirts being auctioned off for funds to support victims of the bombing.) &lt;a href=\"http%3A//scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap%3FgameId%3D330420102%26amp%3Bteams%3Dkansas-city-royals-vs-boston-red-sox\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Red Sox later announced Friday's (April, 19) game would be made up as part of a day-night &lt;a href=\"doubleheader%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubleheader&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday (April, 21). The regularly scheduled game took place at 1:35\u00a0p.m., and a nightcap at 7 p.m.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/9192733/boston-red-sox-boston-bruins-return-amid-more-security\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Even with the loss, the Royals moved to first place since the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Tigers\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; also lost in the &lt;a href=\"American%20League%20Central\"&gt;American League Central&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn April 21, Kansas City ended Boston's seven-game &lt;a href=\"Winning%20streak%20%28sports%29\"&gt;winning streak&lt;/a&gt; with a 4\u20132 win over the Red Sox in the opener of a day-night doubleheader. With tributes to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings still visibly clear, the Royals ended a season-opening streak of 16 games by Red Sox starters allowing three runs or less, tying an AL record achieved by the Oakland Athletics in 1978 and 1981. With the Detroit Tigers losing, the win kept the Royals secure in first place.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap%3FgameId%3D330421103\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In the second game of the doubleheader, Kansas City narrowly beat Boston 5\u20134 in 10 innings to win the weekend series (and sweep the doubleheader), as a result of &lt;a href=\"Lorenzo%20Cain\"&gt;Lorenzo Cain&lt;/a&gt; walking with two outs and the bases loaded in the 10th inning. With both wins against the Red Sox on April 21, Kansas City remained in first place in the AL Central as did Boston in the AL East.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap%3FgameId%3D330421302\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A disappointing ending to an emotional weekend for the Red Sox, &lt;a href=\"Ervin%20Santana\"&gt;Ervin Santana&lt;/a&gt; (2-1) pitched seven strong innings, &lt;a href=\"Kelvin%20Herrera\"&gt;Kelvin Herrera&lt;/a&gt; (2\u20132) got the win and &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Holland\"&gt;Greg Holland&lt;/a&gt; pitched a perfect ninth for his fourth save in five opportunities. &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Butler%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Billy Butler&lt;/a&gt; homered in the eighth inning of the night game (clearing the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Monster\"&gt;Green Monster&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;a href=\"http%3A//scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap%3FgameId%3D330421302%26amp%3Bteams%3Dkansas-city-royals-vs-boston-red-sox\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Royals also recalled LHP &lt;a href=\"Will%20Smith%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Will Smith&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Triple-A%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Triple-A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sports%20in%20Omaha%2C%20Nebraska%23Baseball\"&gt;Omaha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap%3FgameId%3D330421202%26amp%3Bteams%3Dkansas-city-royals-vs-boston-red-sox\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nRemaining in first place.\nOn April 25, &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Gordon\"&gt;Alex Gordon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;grand slam&lt;/a&gt; (clearing the 420-foot marker on the wall in center field) highlighted a five-run 10th inning for Kansas City, who rallied against the Detroit Tigers bullpen for an 8\u20133 win, keeping the Royals in first place (ALC). &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Butler%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Billy Butler&lt;/a&gt; had three hits on the day and improved to 23 for 55 (.418) off &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Verlander\"&gt;Justin Verlander&lt;/a&gt;, the best mark of anyone with at least 30 at-bats against the Detroit pitcher. &lt;a href=\"Tim%20Collins%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;Tim Collins&lt;/a&gt; (1\u20130) pitched a scoreless ninth for the Royals and got the win. This followed a game the previous day, which the Royals narrowly lost against Detroit (having only played two out of six days due to postponed games and having no batting practice prior to the game on April 24 as a result of bad weather). Overall, the Royals went 4\u20133 at Atlanta, Boston and Detroit. Kansas City did not play a home game since April 14. They played seven road games in 11 days. \"This was a phenomenal road trip for us\", said right-hander &lt;a href=\"James%20Shields%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;James Shields&lt;/a&gt;, who pitched eight solid innings on April 25. \"We're going to look back at this road trip, and I think it's going to be a pretty crucial road trip.\"\nOn April 28, in the opener of a &lt;a href=\"doubleheader%20%28baseball%29\"&gt;doubleheader&lt;/a&gt; caused by a &lt;a href=\"rainout%20%28sports%29\"&gt;rainout&lt;/a&gt; two days earlier, &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Guthrie\"&gt;Jeremy Guthrie&lt;/a&gt; (3\u20130) allowed six hits over 6 2/3 innings for his 16th consecutive start without a loss. That matched the Kansas City record set by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Splittorff\"&gt;Paul Splittorff&lt;/a&gt; from August 13, 1977 \u2013 April 22, 1978. The Royals went on to beat the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season\"&gt;Indians&lt;/a&gt; 9\u20130, with a memorable 500th career hit from &lt;a href=\"Alcides%20Escobar\"&gt;Alcides Escobar&lt;/a&gt; being a home run (370 feet) and a right center home run by Alex Gordon (438 feet), \nMay.\nAfter spending most of April in first place (&lt;a href=\"American%20League%20Central\"&gt;AL Central&lt;/a&gt;), the Royals ended the month with a 14\u201310 record (7\u20134 at home), a half game behind the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season\"&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; as of April 30 (an improvement from their 6\u201315 mark going into May a year ago). However, on May 1, the Royals moved back into first place (15\u201310), due to the Tigers losing to the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season\"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; and then the Royals later beating the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Tampa%20Bay%20Rays%20season\"&gt;Tampa Bay Rays&lt;/a&gt; (giving them a .600 &lt;a href=\"winning%20percentage\"&gt;percentage&lt;/a&gt;). Unfortunately, it was not to last, as the Royals would go 8-20 for the month, their worst May record since 2006 (8-21)."
