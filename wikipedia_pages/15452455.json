    "text": "Jacob Yost (April 1, 1853 \u2013 January 25, 1933) was an American politician who served as mayor of Staunton, as well as twice represented &lt;a href=\"Virginia\"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shenandoah%20Valley\"&gt;Shenandoah Valley&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, from 1887\u20131889 and 1897\u20131899.\nEarly and family life.\nYost was born in &lt;a href=\"Staunton%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Staunton, Virginia&lt;/a&gt; in 1853 to Major Samuel McPherson Yost (1829-1915) and his wife Henrietta Cushing Yost (1834-1856). His father became &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Agent\"&gt;Indian Agent&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; in 1857, and Quartermaster Major in the &lt;a href=\"Confederate%20States%20Army\"&gt;Confederate States Army&lt;/a&gt; (C.S.A.) during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. Branches of the Yost family were active in Shenandoah and Rockingham Counties. A cousin was C.S.A. General &lt;a href=\"John%20R.%20Jones\"&gt;John R. Jones&lt;/a&gt; (son of Samuel's sister Harriet Yost). Samuel's cousins (with the same grandmother, Catharine Miller (b. Aug. 2, 1778)) included Major Hunter Liggett of the 31st U.S.V. in the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Islands\"&gt;Philippine Islands&lt;/a&gt; and C.S.A. Lt. &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20N.%20Liggett\"&gt;Jacob N. Liggett&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Harrisonburg%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Harrisonburg, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. He had an elder brother Merrell Cushing Yost (1851-1868), a younger brother Isaac Willis Yost (1855-1857), younger sister Bettie (b. 1860), and later after his father's remarriage, several half-siblings, including and half sister Alice Yost Pipes (1869-1969)\nHaving lost his mother as an infant, young Jacob Yost was raised by his grandmother Kate D. Yost, aunt Mary and cousin Samuel W.P. Yost. He attended the public schools and &lt;a href=\"Jedediah%20Hotchkiss\"&gt;Jedediah Hotchkiss&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mossy%20Creek%20Academy\"&gt;Mossy Creek Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Augusta%20County%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Augusta County&lt;/a&gt;, where he learned about cartography and mining. After the American Civil War, his father Samuel M. Yost lived with his family (including his second wife, Catherine) in &lt;a href=\"Linville%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Linville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rockingham%20County%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Rockingham County, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;.\nJacob Yost married Mary S. Young Yost (1859-1930) on January 13, 1881. They had a daughter Mary born in 1882 and who became a teacher in Staunton but still lived with her parents in the 1910 census, and a son Merrill C. Yost (b. 1900) who survived to adulthood.\nCareer.\nYost learned the printing trade from his father and in 1875 purchased the \"Valley Virginian\". The family enterprise also published various books. He also engaged in civil engineering involving iron and coal (traditional industries in Rockingham County).\nAlthough his father Samuel participated in the National Republican Convention of 1880 and served as Staunton's postmaster under Presidents Grant, Hays, Arthur, Harrison and McKinley, Jacob Yost was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for election in 1884 to the &lt;a href=\"Forty-ninth%20Congress\"&gt;Forty-ninth Congress&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever&lt;a href=\"Staunton%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Staunton's&lt;/a&gt; voters elected him mayor in May 1886 and he served until January 1887, when he resigned, having been elected to Congress. He was elected as a Republican to the &lt;a href=\"Fiftieth%20Congress\"&gt;Fiftieth Congress&lt;/a&gt; (March 4, 1887 \u2013 March 3, 1889) but was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1888 to the &lt;a href=\"Fifty-first%20Congress\"&gt;Fifty-first Congress&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, he was elected to the &lt;a href=\"Fifty-fifth%20Congress\"&gt;Fifty-fifth Congress&lt;/a&gt; (March 4, 1897 \u2013 March 3, 1899) but he declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1898.\nLater life and death.\nAfter leaving Congress, Yost engaged in the management and development of iron ore and coal lands. He moved to &lt;a href=\"Palo%20Alto%2C%20California\"&gt;Palo Alto, California&lt;/a&gt; in 1925 and lived there in retirement until his death on January 25, 1933. His body was returned to Staunton for burial in historic Thornrose Cemetery."
