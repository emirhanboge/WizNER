    "title": "Southern Uplands",
    "text": "The Southern Uplands () are the southernmost and least populous of mainland &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;'s three major geographic areas (the others being the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Lowlands\"&gt;Central Lowlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Highlands\"&gt;Highlands&lt;/a&gt;). The term is used both to describe the geographical region and to collectively denote the various ranges of &lt;a href=\"hill\"&gt;hill&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;s within this region. An overwhelmingly rural and agricultural region, the Southern Uplands are partly forested and contain many areas of open moorland - the hill names in the area are congruent with these characteristics.\nGeology.\nThe Southern Uplands consist mainly of &lt;a href=\"Silurian\"&gt;Silurian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sedimentary%20rock\"&gt;sedimentary deposits&lt;/a&gt; deposited in the &lt;a href=\"Iapetus%20Ocean\"&gt;Iapetus Ocean&lt;/a&gt; from 500 to 400\u00a0million years ago. These rocks were pushed up from the sea bed into an &lt;a href=\"accretionary%20wedge\"&gt;accretionary wedge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Caledonian%20orogeny\"&gt;Caledonian orogeny&lt;/a&gt;, roughly 400\u00a0million years ago (&lt;a href=\"Megaannum\"&gt;Ma&lt;/a&gt;), when the continents and &lt;a href=\"terrane\"&gt;terrane&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Laurentia\"&gt;Laurentia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baltica\"&gt;Baltica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avalonia\"&gt;Avalonia&lt;/a&gt; collided. The Caledonian orogeny is named for &lt;a href=\"Caledonia\"&gt;Caledonia&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; name for &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the rocks are weakly &lt;a href=\"Metamorphism\"&gt;metamorphosed&lt;/a&gt; coarse &lt;a href=\"greywacke\"&gt;greywacke&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tectonic processes involved in the formation of the accretionary wedge, where sediment is scraped off the seafloor as a tectonic plate is &lt;a href=\"Subduction\"&gt;subducted&lt;/a&gt;, has led to the formation of multiple, major, east\u2013west &lt;a href=\"Fault%20%28geology%29\"&gt;faults&lt;/a&gt; that are now exploited by rivers and define valleys across the Southern Uplands. Levels of deformation associated with these faults is highly variable, but is pervasive in the finer-grained sediments. Secondary mineralisation has further altered these Lower Panlaeozoic rocks which are hosts for some distinctive &lt;a href=\"Mineral%20spring\"&gt;springs&lt;/a&gt;, some of which have been exploited for tourism, such as those around &lt;a href=\"Moffat\"&gt;Moffat&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Southern Uplands lie south of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Uplands%20Fault\"&gt;Southern Uplands Fault&lt;/a&gt; line that runs from &lt;a href=\"Ballantrae\"&gt;Ballantrae&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Ayrshire\"&gt;Ayrshire&lt;/a&gt; coast northeastwards to &lt;a href=\"Dunbar\"&gt;Dunbar&lt;/a&gt; in East Lothian on the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast, a distance of some .\nHill ranges.\nThere are several ranges of hills and mountains within the Southern Uplands. From east to west these are:\nPeaks.\nAlthough the summits are not as high as many in the Scottish Highlands nor other famous mountain regions, parts of the Southern Uplands are remote and mountainous, containing about 120 &lt;a href=\"Marilyn%20%28hill%29\"&gt;Marilyn&lt;/a&gt;s, the majority of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Donald%20mountains%20in%20Scotland\"&gt;Donalds&lt;/a&gt; and a substantial number of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Corbett%20mountains%20in%20Scotland\"&gt;Corbetts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Graham%20mountains%20in%20Scotland\"&gt;Grahams&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of the more notable peaks in the Southern Uplands are:\nThe Southern Uplands are home to the UK's second highest, and Scotland's highest, village, &lt;a href=\"Wanlockhead\"&gt;Wanlockhead&lt;/a&gt;, above sea level.\nRivers and lochs.\nThe region is drained by numerous rivers, the most important of which are Scotland's third and fourth longest, the &lt;a href=\"River%20Clyde\"&gt;River Clyde&lt;/a&gt; at and the &lt;a href=\"River%20Tweed\"&gt;River Tweed&lt;/a&gt; at respectively. Several significant rivers drain southwards into the Solway Firth and Irish Sea including (from west to east) the &lt;a href=\"River%20Cree\"&gt;River Cree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"River%20Dee%2C%20Galloway\"&gt;River Dee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"River%20Urr\"&gt;River Urr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"River%20Nith\"&gt;River Nith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"River%20Annan\"&gt;River Annan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"River%20Esk%2C%20Dumfries%20and%20Galloway\"&gt;River Esk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are numerous &lt;a href=\"loch\"&gt;loch&lt;/a&gt;s in the Southern Uplands, particularly in the west. The largest is &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Ken\"&gt;Loch Ken&lt;/a&gt; the water lever of the loch was increased in 1936 when the Glenlochar Barrage was installed on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Dee%2C%20Galloway\"&gt;River Dee&lt;/a&gt; as well the &lt;a href=\"Water%20of%20Ken\"&gt;Water of Ken&lt;/a&gt; was dammed to create man made lochs as part of the Galloway Hydro Scheme. Several other lochs in Galloway are dammed such as &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Doon\"&gt;Loch Doon&lt;/a&gt;, Loch Bradan and &lt;a href=\"Clatteringshaws%20Loch\"&gt;Clatteringshaws Loch&lt;/a&gt; though many smaller ones remain in a more natural state such as Loch Dee, &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Enoch\"&gt;Loch Enoch&lt;/a&gt;, Loch Grannoch and &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Trool\"&gt;Loch Trool&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo the east of Moffat is the largest natural body of water in the Borders Region of the Southern Uplands, &lt;a href=\"St.%20Mary%27s%20Loch\"&gt;St. Mary's Loch&lt;/a&gt; together with the adjacent &lt;a href=\"Loch%20of%20the%20Lowes\"&gt;Loch of the Lowes&lt;/a&gt; and nearby &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Skeen\"&gt;Loch Skeen&lt;/a&gt;. There are several other reservoirs in the vicinity including &lt;a href=\"Megget%20Reservoir\"&gt;Megget Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talla%20Reservoir\"&gt;Talla Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fruid%20Reservoir\"&gt;Fruid Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; whilst &lt;a href=\"Daer%20Reservoir\"&gt;Daer Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; lies among the Lowther Hills.\nWildlife.\nThe area has a wide diversity of species and habitats. The uplands support &lt;a href=\"black%20grouse\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"red%20grouse\"&gt;red grouse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mountain%20hare\"&gt;mountain hare&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"golden%20eagle\"&gt;golden eagle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hen%20harrier\"&gt;hen harrier&lt;/a&gt;s and some unusual plant species. The western hills are home to &lt;a href=\"red%20deer\"&gt;red deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"roe%20deer\"&gt;roe deer&lt;/a&gt;, feral &lt;a href=\"goats\"&gt;goats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wild%20boar\"&gt;wild boar&lt;/a&gt;. The western forests have one fifth of the Scottish population of &lt;a href=\"red%20squirrel\"&gt;red squirrel&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Osprey\"&gt;Osprey&lt;/a&gt;s are present at some of the lochs of the Galloway Forest Park, &lt;a href=\"St%20Mary%27s%20Loch\"&gt;St Mary's Loch&lt;/a&gt; and along the &lt;a href=\"River%20Tweed\"&gt;River Tweed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Brown%20trout\"&gt;Brown trout&lt;/a&gt; are common in many burns and a number of the rivers in the area have populations of &lt;a href=\"sea%20trout\"&gt;sea trout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20otter\"&gt;Eurasian otter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLocal government.\nThe two &lt;a href=\"unitary%20authority\"&gt;unitary authorities&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dumfries%20and%20Galloway\"&gt;Dumfries and Galloway&lt;/a&gt; in the west\nand the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Borders\"&gt;Scottish Borders&lt;/a&gt; in the east cover almost all of the Southern Uplands. Along its northern margins, the councils of &lt;a href=\"South%20Ayrshire\"&gt;South Ayrshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Ayrshire\"&gt;East Ayrshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Lanarkshire\"&gt;South Lanarkshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Lothian\"&gt;East Lothian&lt;/a&gt; extend into the region. After local government reorganisation in 1974 and prior to further reorganisation in 1996, the Southern Uplands were administered by the two 'regions' of Dumfries &amp; Galloway and Borders along with the southern margins of the regions of Strathclyde and Lothian. Within each of these regions were districts with their own district councils. Historically, i.e. prior to 1974, the region comprised the counties of &lt;a href=\"Wigtownshire\"&gt;Wigtown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kirkcudbrightshire\"&gt;Kirkcudbright&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dumfriesshire\"&gt;Dumfries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roxburghshire\"&gt;Roxburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peeblesshire\"&gt;Peebles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Selkirkshire\"&gt;Selkirk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Berwickshire\"&gt;Berwick&lt;/a&gt; together with parts of &lt;a href=\"Ayrshire\"&gt;Ayrshire&lt;/a&gt;, Lanarkshire, &lt;a href=\"Midlothian\"&gt;Midlothian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Lothian\"&gt;East Lothian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe geography of the region has caused it to be sparsely populated, a characteristic shared with the Highlands but in contrast to the Central Lowlands. Although the political and geographical borders do not precisely coincide, the two southern local authority areas have a combined population of around 265,000 across , fewer inhabitants than five of the areas within the Central Lowlands, for example &lt;a href=\"North%20Lanarkshire\"&gt;North Lanarkshire&lt;/a&gt; is home to 340,000 across .\nEconomy.\nAgriculture and forestry are the main forms of land use in the Southern Uplands. Sustainable power has been in production for several decades: the &lt;a href=\"Galloway%20hydro-electric%20power%20scheme\"&gt;Galloway hydro-electric power scheme&lt;/a&gt; was built between 1930 and 1936. More recently a number of &lt;a href=\"wind%20farms\"&gt;wind farms&lt;/a&gt; have been developed on upland sites. Tourism and recreation are of increasing importance: walking, fishing and grouse shooting are traditional pursuits and mountain biking has become popular in recent years.\nThe textile industry employed large numbers in many of the towns of the Scottish Borders in the 19th and 20th centuries. Stocking frames were introduced in &lt;a href=\"Hawick\"&gt;Hawick&lt;/a&gt; in 1771 and &lt;a href=\"Galashiels\"&gt;Galashiels&lt;/a&gt;' first woollen mill was built in 1800, but textile manufacture had a long history in the area: linen production had been a major industry since the Middle Ages. The textile industry declined in the late 20th century, with 7,800 people employed in 1981 and only 4,400 by 1998. However, it continues to be significant both to the local economy and to that of Scotland in general.\nAgriculture.\nGenerally, sheep and arable farming are more predominant in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Borders\"&gt;Scottish Borders&lt;/a&gt; to the east, while dairy farming is traditionally more important in &lt;a href=\"Dumfries%20and%20Galloway\"&gt;Dumfries and Galloway&lt;/a&gt;, although recent years here have seen a move away from cattle grazing towards sheep farming. Several breeds of livestock have originated in the Southern Uplands, including &lt;a href=\"Galloway%20cattle\"&gt;Galloway cattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayrshire%20cattle\"&gt;Ayrshire dairy cattle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cheviot%20sheep\"&gt;Cheviot sheep&lt;/a&gt;.\nForestry.\nLarge areas of the Southern Uplands are covered with forests such as:-\nThe amount of forested land cover in the western Southern Uplands increased greatly between the 1940s and the 1980s, from 1% to 23%.\nTransport.\nThe Southern Uplands have always formed a major obstacle to travel between the more heavily populated and industrialised &lt;a href=\"Central%20Belt\"&gt;Central Belt&lt;/a&gt; of Scotland and England to the south. Major roads and railways follow the east coast route and various valley routes radiating northwards from the Carlisle area.\nRoad.\nSeveral primary roads run through the Southern Uplands, most of which run north\u2013south, with the most notable exception being the A75. The most significant of these roads is the M74 motorway connecting Scotland and England. These roads include\nRail.\nFive railway lines pass through, or into, the Southern Uplands; all in a roughly north\u2013south direction. These are the:\nAir and sea.\nThere are no major airports within the area. The nearest international passenger airports are &lt;a href=\"Glasgow%20Prestwick%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Glasgow Prestwick International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glasgow%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Glasgow International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20Airport\"&gt;Edinburgh Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nVehicle ferries operate between Stranraer and &lt;a href=\"Cairnryan\"&gt;Cairnryan&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland and &lt;a href=\"Belfast\"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Larne\"&gt;Larne&lt;/a&gt; in Northern Ireland respectively.\nRecreation.\nWalking.\nThere are numerous walks through the Southern Uplands. These include the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Upland%20Way\"&gt;Southern Upland Way&lt;/a&gt;, a coast to coast walk between &lt;a href=\"Portpatrick\"&gt;Portpatrick&lt;/a&gt; in the west and &lt;a href=\"Cockburnspath\"&gt;Cockburnspath&lt;/a&gt; in the east.\nClimbing.\nThere is some good rock climbing in the Southern Uplands, particularly in the western portion, the Galloway Hills. The majority of the climbing is on good quality granite, often slabby and sometimes a bit broken in nature. In cold winters there is good ice climbing on the hills of &lt;a href=\"Craignaw\"&gt;Craignaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merrick%2C%20Galloway\"&gt;Merrick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairnsmore%20of%20Fleet\"&gt;Cairnsmore of Fleet&lt;/a&gt;.\nMountain-biking.\nThe &lt;a href=\"7stanes\"&gt;7stanes&lt;/a&gt; are seven &lt;a href=\"mountain%20biking\"&gt;mountain biking&lt;/a&gt; centres spanning the south of Scotland, from the heart of the Scottish Borders to Dumfries and Galloway. They are on &lt;a href=\"Forestry%20Commission\"&gt;Forestry Commission&lt;/a&gt; land and along with schemes in Wales are regarded as the benchmark by which further trails in the UK should be developed. They are known as the 7stanes because each venue features a 'stane' (&lt;a href=\"Scots%20language\"&gt;Scots&lt;/a&gt; for stone) somewhere along the forest trails.\nThe Seven Stanes:\nCulture.\nThe Southern Uplands and especially those areas adjacent to the Anglo-Scottish border have a troubled and bloody history. They were the scene of many raids, campaigns and battles, including the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ancrum%20Moor\"&gt;Battle of Ancrum Moor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Nesbit%20Moor%20%281402%29\"&gt;Battle of Nesbit Moor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Philiphaugh\"&gt;Battle of Philiphaugh&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Common%20Riding\"&gt;Common Riding&lt;/a&gt; festivals of many Southern Upland towns such as &lt;a href=\"Jedburgh\"&gt;Jedburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kelso%2C%20Scottish%20Borders\"&gt;Kelso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hawick\"&gt;Hawick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peebles\"&gt;Peebles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Selkirk%2C%20Scottish%20Borders\"&gt;Selkirk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Langholm\"&gt;Langholm&lt;/a&gt; recall this history, re-enacting the practice of riding the boundaries of the town to enable warning to be given of raids from the south.\nThis violent history is also commemorated in many &lt;a href=\"Border%20ballad\"&gt;Border ballad&lt;/a&gt;s, another common theme of which is the supernatural, as in the ballads of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20the%20Rhymer\"&gt;Thomas the Rhymer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tam%20Lin\"&gt;Tam Lin&lt;/a&gt;. Many Border ballads were collected by Sir &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Scott\"&gt;Walter Scott&lt;/a&gt; in his \"&lt;a href=\"Minstrelsy%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Border\"&gt;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&lt;/a&gt;\". Scott also portrayed the social history, folklore and traditions of the Southern Uplands in several of his prose and verse works (such as \"The Lay of the Last Minstrel\"), as did &lt;a href=\"James%20Hogg\"&gt;James Hogg&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Ettrick%2C%20Scotland\"&gt;Ettrick&lt;/a&gt; Shepherd."
