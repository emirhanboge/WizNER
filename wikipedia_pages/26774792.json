    "text": "&lt;a href=\"Hapoel\"&gt;Hapoel&lt;/a&gt; Ashdod F.C. () is an Israeli &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Ashdod\"&gt;Ashdod&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999, it merged with local rivals &lt;a href=\"Maccabi%20Ironi%20Ashdod%20F.C.\"&gt;Ironi Ashdod&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Ashdod\"&gt;F.C. Ashdod&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2015, the club was resurrected by its fans.\nHistory.\nOriginal club.\nThe club was founded in 1957 and reached the second tier after winning &lt;a href=\"Liga%20Bet\"&gt;Liga Bet&lt;/a&gt; South B Division in the &lt;a href=\"1970%E2%80%9371%20Liga%20Bet\"&gt;1970\u201371 season&lt;/a&gt;. After several lower-table finishes, the club was relegated to &lt;a href=\"Liga%20Alef\"&gt;Liga Alef&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1978%E2%80%9379%20Liga%20Artzit\"&gt;1978\u201379 season&lt;/a&gt;, in which they finished bottom. They returned to the second division at the end of the &lt;a href=\"1989%E2%80%9390%20Liga%20Alef\"&gt;1989\u201390 season&lt;/a&gt;, in which they won the southern division of Liga Alef, beating local rivals &lt;a href=\"Maccabi%20Ironi%20Ashdod%20F.C.\"&gt;Maccabi Ironi Ashdod&lt;/a&gt; to the title by a single point. They narrowly avoiding relegation in &lt;a href=\"1993%E2%80%9394%20Liga%20Artzit\"&gt;1993\u201394&lt;/a&gt;, when they finished one place above the relegation zone, but after several more lower-table finishes, in &lt;a href=\"1997%E2%80%9398%20Liga%20Artzit\"&gt;1997\u201398&lt;/a&gt; the club finished third, one place below promotion to the top division, but the &lt;a href=\"1998%E2%80%9399%20Liga%20Artzit\"&gt;following season&lt;/a&gt; finished tenth, and were due to be relegated two divisions due to financial problems. However, the club merged with Maccabi Ironi Ashdod, to form &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Ashdod\"&gt;F.C. Ashdod&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2001 a new club, Hapoel Namal Ashdod was established, playing in &lt;a href=\"Liga%20Gimel\"&gt;Liga Gimel&lt;/a&gt;. Although the club was initially successful, winning its division and gaining promotion to Liga Bet, at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20Liga%20Bet\"&gt;2003\u201304 season&lt;/a&gt;, in which it finished fourth, it was disbanded.\nRe-established club.\nIn March 2015, fans of Hapoel Ashdod gathered and re-established the club, with the purpose of joining &lt;a href=\"Liga%20Gimel\"&gt;Liga Gimel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20in%20Israeli%20football\"&gt;2015\u201316 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater on that month, &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Ashdod\"&gt;F.C. Ashdod's&lt;/a&gt; chairman, &lt;a href=\"Jacky%20Ben-Zaken\"&gt;Jacky Ben-Zaken&lt;/a&gt;, decided to rename F.C. Ashdod to Hapoel Ashdod and to play in red shirts, following a dispute with fans of the previous club, &lt;a href=\"Maccabi%20Ironi%20Ashdod%20F.C.\"&gt;Maccabi Ironi Ashdod&lt;/a&gt;. Despite warnings from the &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Israel Football Association&lt;/a&gt;, which informed the club that such changes during season are illegal, F.C. Ashdod did show up for their &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Israeli%20Premier%20League%23Bottom%20Playoff\"&gt;Bottom playoff&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"Hapoel%20Ra%27anana%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Hapoel Ra'anana&lt;/a&gt; in red shirts, with the caption \"F.C. Hapoel Ashdod\", and was eventually disciplined. However, Hapoel Ashdod fans have decided that the club will be registered in Liga Gimel, rather than joining forces with Ben-Zaken's F.C. Ashdod.\nAt the same time, another group of Hapoel Ashdod fans, headed by lawyer Ya'akov Shitrit, formed a second club, due to play in &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20Liga%20Gimel\"&gt;2015\u201316 Liga Gimel&lt;/a&gt;. As Shitrit's group was affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Hapoel\"&gt;Hapoel&lt;/a&gt; organization, this club was registered in the &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Football%20Association\"&gt;IFA&lt;/a&gt; under the name &lt;a href=\"Hapoel%20Bnei%20Ashdod%20F.C.\"&gt;Hapoel Bnei Ashdod&lt;/a&gt; (Hebrew:\u05d4\u05e4\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e9\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3), while the fans' club was forced to drop the name Hapoel from their club and registered under the name of &lt;a href=\"Agudat%20Sport%20Ashdod%20F.C.\"&gt;Agudat Sport Ashdod&lt;/a&gt; (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d2\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8 \u05d0\u05e9\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3), (or in short Hebrew: \u05d0.\u05e1. \u05d0\u05e9\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3, Aleph Samekh Ashdod, lit. A.S. Ashdod).\nOn 18 September 2015 the club played it first official match, beating &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Tzeirei%20al-Hoshla\"&gt;F.C. Tzeirei al-Hoshla&lt;/a&gt; 6\u20130 in the first round of the &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20Israel%20State%20Cup\"&gt;State Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The club's first manager, former &lt;a href=\"Hapoel%20Tel%20Aviv%20F.C.\"&gt;Hapoel Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href=\"Moris%20Zano\"&gt;Moris Zano&lt;/a&gt; led the club through its first matches, but was fired in October 2015. In December 2015, the club signed &lt;a href=\"Pini%20Balili\"&gt;Pini Balili&lt;/a&gt; as its new manager."
