    "text": "The Lindenhof (lit.: \"courtyard of the lime\") is a &lt;a href=\"moraine\"&gt;moraine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hill\"&gt;hill&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"public%20square\"&gt;public square&lt;/a&gt; in the historic center of &lt;a href=\"Z%C3%BCrich\"&gt;Z\u00fcrich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. It is the site of the &lt;a href=\"Switzerland%20in%20the%20Roman%20era\"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carolingian\"&gt;Carolingian&lt;/a&gt; era &lt;a href=\"Kaiserpfalz\"&gt;Kaiserpfalz&lt;/a&gt; around which the city has historically grown. The hilltop area\u2014including its prehistoric, Roman, and medieval remains\u2014is listed as a &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20inventory%20of%20cultural%20property%20of%20national%20and%20regional%20significance\"&gt;Swiss heritage site of national significance&lt;/a&gt;.\nTopography.\nLindenhof (its northern part is called \"Sihlb\u00fchl\") dominates the &lt;a href=\"Lindenhof%20%28quarter%29\"&gt;Lindenhof quarter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Altstadt%20%28Z%C3%BCrich%29\"&gt;district 1 (Altstadt)&lt;/a&gt;, the historical center of Z\u00fcrich's &lt;a href=\"Altstadt\"&gt;Altstadt&lt;/a&gt;. To the North, it ends at \"Uraniastrasse\" (City police station) and to the South, it ends near &lt;a href=\"St.%20Peter%2C%20Z%C3%BCrich\"&gt;St. Peter church&lt;/a&gt;. In the West, the hill is limited by the &lt;a href=\"Bahnhofstrasse\"&gt;Bahnhofstrasse&lt;/a&gt;, and in the east, it ends at the &lt;a href=\"Limmat\"&gt;Limmat&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Schipfe\"&gt;Schipfe&lt;/a&gt; quarter.\nLindenhof sits atop the remains of a &lt;a href=\"last%20glacial%20period\"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt;. The hill and its &lt;a href=\"public%20square\"&gt;public square&lt;/a&gt; are part of the &lt;a href=\"Linth\"&gt;Linth&lt;/a&gt; Glacier's &lt;a href=\"moraine\"&gt;moraine&lt;/a&gt;s in the area of Z\u00fcrich. The now largely flattened Lindenhof (428 m \u00fc. M) rises about 25 meters above the Limmat.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\n \nAt the flat shore of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Zurich\"&gt;Lake Zurich&lt;/a&gt; were Neolithic and Bronze Age (4500 to 850 BC) &lt;a href=\"Prehistoric%20pile%20dwellings%20around%20Z%C3%BCrichsee\"&gt;lakeside settlements&lt;/a&gt;, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Kleiner%20Hafner\"&gt;Kleiner Hafner&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Grosser%20Hafner\"&gt;Grosser Hafner&lt;/a&gt;\" (both small former islands west of \"&lt;a href=\"Sechsel%C3%A4utenplatz\"&gt;Sechsel\u00e4utenplatz&lt;/a&gt;\", near \"&lt;a href=\"Bausch%C3%A4nzli\"&gt;Bausch\u00e4nzli&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"Stadthausquai\"&gt;Stadthausquai&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Alpenquai\"&gt;Alpenquai&lt;/a&gt;\" at the &lt;a href=\"B%C3%BCrkliplatz\"&gt;B\u00fcrkliplatz&lt;/a&gt; square and Lindenhof). Lindenhof was largely surrounded by water: until the early medieval area, neighboring \"&lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCnsterhof\"&gt;M\u00fcnsterhof&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Fraum%C3%BCnster\"&gt;Fraum\u00fcnster&lt;/a&gt; abbey square) was a swampy hollow flooded by the &lt;a href=\"Sihl\"&gt;Sihl&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, Lindenhof was an optimal location for early fortified settlements. &lt;a href=\"Middle%20bronze%20age\"&gt;Middle bronze age&lt;/a&gt; (1500 BC) artefacts were found near the Limmat (&lt;a href=\"Schipfe\"&gt;Schipfe&lt;/a&gt;). Archaeologists found remains of a &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oppidum\"&gt;Oppidum&lt;/a&gt; from the 1st century BC (&lt;a href=\"La%20T%C3%A8ne%20culture\"&gt;La T\u00e8ne culture&lt;/a&gt;), whose remains were found in archaeological campaigns in the years 1989, 1997, 2004 and 2007 on Lindenhof and &lt;a href=\"Rennweg%20%28Z%C3%BCrich%29\"&gt;Rennweg&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoman Vicus.\nIn 15 BC, &lt;a href=\"Augustus\"&gt;Augustus's&lt;/a&gt; stepsons Drusus and &lt;a href=\"Tiberius\"&gt;Tiberius&lt;/a&gt; integrated the territory on the left side of Lake Zurich into the Roman provinces &lt;a href=\"Raetia\"&gt;Raetia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Germania%20Superior\"&gt;Germania Superior&lt;/a&gt;. Several stone buildings from the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman period&lt;/a&gt; were located on and around the hill. It was part of the small &lt;a href=\"Vicus%20%28Rome%29\"&gt;vicus&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Turicum%20%28Z%C3%BCrich%29\"&gt;Turicum&lt;/a&gt;\", located on both sides of the Limmat and connected by a Roman bridge located near the present \"Rathausbr\u00fccke\". \n\"Turicum\", Z\u00fcrich's Roman name and possibly also its Celtic name, is engraved on a 2nd-century tombstone of a little boy. It was found on May 15, 1747, and it refers to the Roman \"STA(tio) TUR(i)CEN(sis)\". The tombstone is located in the &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20National%20Museum\"&gt;Swiss National Museum&lt;/a&gt;; a copy is integrated in the Lindenhof wall at \"Pfalzgasse\", leading to St. Peter church.\nUsing the topography, the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20legion\"&gt;Roman military&lt;/a&gt; built a citadel on top of the hill in the years of the Roman emperor &lt;a href=\"Valentinian%20I\"&gt;Valentinian I&lt;/a&gt; (364\u2013375), to defend migrations from the North by the &lt;a href=\"Alamanni\"&gt;Alamanni&lt;/a&gt;. It was 4500 square meters large, and it was fitted with 10 towers and two meter wide walls.\nMedieval castle and graveyard.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"middle%20ages\"&gt;middle ages&lt;/a&gt;, the hilltop leveled fort became the retaining wall and gave the Lindenhof terrace a form similar to its current form. The remains of the Roman &lt;a href=\"Castrum\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; were used as the center of the later fortification of the historical center of Z\u00fcrich. Significant parts of the lime mortar and ancient castle wall were integrated into the town houses around the Lindenhof and in a &lt;a href=\"Kaiserpfalz\"&gt;Kaiserpfalz&lt;/a&gt; (broken in 1218), which served as a place of festivities, including the engagement of the German emperor &lt;a href=\"Henry%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Henry IV&lt;/a&gt; with Bertha von Turin on Christmas in 1055. The Roman castle's remains existed until the early medieval age: a &lt;a href=\"Carolingian%20dynasty\"&gt;Carolingian&lt;/a&gt;, later &lt;a href=\"Ottonian%20dynasty\"&gt;Ottonian&lt;/a&gt; \"Pfalz\" (1054) was built on its remains. This &lt;a href=\"Kaiserpfalz\"&gt;Kaiserpfalz&lt;/a&gt; was a long building with a chapel on the eastern side of the fortified hill; it is last mentioned in 1172, and it was derelict by 1218, when its remains were scavenged for construction of the &lt;a href=\"fortifications%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich\"&gt;city walls&lt;/a&gt; and stone masonry on private houses.\nIn 1937, archaeologists found graves of late medieval children and adults that were oriented from the east to the west. In the year 1384, a chapel on the Lindenhof was mentioned, but no remains have been found. It is believed that the chapel was part of the processional axis &lt;a href=\"Wasserkirche\"&gt;Wasserkirche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grossm%C3%BCnster\"&gt;Grossm\u00fcnster&lt;/a&gt; and Fraum\u00fcnster church processions that ended in 1524 or 1525 (&lt;a href=\"Reformation%20in%20Z%C3%BCrich\"&gt;Reformation in Z\u00fcrich&lt;/a&gt;). These religious celebrations at Pentecost honored Z\u00fcrich's Saints &lt;a href=\"Felix%20and%20Regula\"&gt;Felix and Regula&lt;/a&gt; and Exuperantius.\nModern public park.\nFollowing the demolition of the former royal residence, the hill\u2014the only public park within the city walls\u2014became an area for public life and relaxation, with dense tree vegetation, stone tables, crossbow stands, and bowling and chess; the latter are still very popular in modern times. According to a chronicle, fifty-two &lt;a href=\"tilia\"&gt;tilia&lt;/a&gt;s (lime trees) were planted in 1774. Bow and crossbow-shooting was probably one of the most important leisure activities on the Lindenhof. Each Z\u00fcrich guild had its own stone table, and the costumed guild members met on &lt;a href=\"Sechsel%C3%A4uten\"&gt;Sechsel\u00e4uten&lt;/a&gt; for dinner, described by &lt;a href=\"Gottfried%20Keller\"&gt;Gottfried Keller&lt;/a&gt; in his poem \"Ein Festzug in Z\u00fcrich\" (a procession in Z\u00fcrich, 1856).\nIn August 1526, guests from &lt;a href=\"St.%20Gallen\"&gt;St. Gallen&lt;/a&gt; were invited by the city councils and all the &lt;a href=\"Guilds%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich\"&gt;Guilds of Z\u00fcrich&lt;/a&gt; for a dinner. The attendees of this dinner included &lt;a href=\"Ulrich%20Zwingli\"&gt;Ulrich Zwingli&lt;/a&gt;, the prominent Z\u00fcrich cleric; &lt;a href=\"Leo%20Jud\"&gt;Leo Jud&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Konrad%20Pelikan\"&gt;Konrad Pelikan&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Myconius\"&gt;Friedrich Myconius&lt;/a&gt;; and the &lt;a href=\"Kappel%20am%20Albis\"&gt;Kappel abbey&lt;/a&gt;'s abbot. \nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Hedwig%20Fountain\"&gt;Hedwig Fountain&lt;/a&gt;\" (1688) was sculpted by &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Siber\"&gt;Gustav Siber&lt;/a&gt;. It depicts the legend of the siege of Z\u00fcrich in 1292 with a helmeted sculpture of the leader of the Z\u00fcrich women. Under baroque influence, Lindenhof was converted in 1780 to a strictly geometrical park.\n1851, the &lt;a href=\"Freemasonry\"&gt;Masonic lodge&lt;/a&gt; \"Modestia cum Libertate\" (M.c.L.) bought the \"Paradies\" building and converted it into a lodge building with distinctive gables. At this time, coins, stove tiles and other artefacts from the Roman and medieval times were found. 1865, severe storm damage resulted in a redesign: Instead of Lime trees, the park was dominated for some years by chestnut and acacia trees. The redesign was not accepted by the population, and in 1900, Lindenhof Square was given its present appearance.\nToday, there are numerous public events and festivals in addition to the historical guild dinner. The Square is also a tourist attraction. Cars are not allowed in the narrow streets to the Lindenhof.\nAmong the prominent historical visitors are &lt;a href=\"Giacomo%20Casanova\"&gt;Giacomo Casanova&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe\"&gt;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20von%20M%C3%BCller\"&gt;Johannes von M\u00fcller&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Herzog\"&gt;Herzog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Augustus%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\"&gt;Charles Augustus, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Gottlieb%20Fichte\"&gt;Johann Gottlieb Fichte&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Louise%20Germaine%20de%20Sta%C3%ABl\"&gt;Anne Louise Germaine de Sta\u00ebl&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Schlegel\"&gt;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Ludwig%20Uhland\"&gt;Johann Ludwig Uhland&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Liszt\"&gt;Franz Liszt&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Richard Wagner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Brahms\"&gt;Johannes Brahms&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeritage site of national significance.\nThe hillside area is listed as a &lt;a href=\"Swiss%20inventory%20of%20cultural%20property%20of%20national%20and%20regional%20significance\"&gt;Swiss heritage site of national significance&lt;/a&gt;, including the remains of its &lt;a href=\"Oppidum%20Z%C3%BCrich%20Lindenhof\"&gt;prehistoric Celtic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turicum%20%28Z%C3%BCrich%29\"&gt;Gallo-Roman&lt;/a&gt; and medieval settlements and buildings."
