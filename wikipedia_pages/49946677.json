These recordings will have to be available through streaming platforms. Applicable streaming services are paid subscription, full catalog, on-demand streaming/limited download platforms that have existed as such within the United States for at least one full year as of the submission deadline. All recordings entered must have an assigned &lt;a href=\"International%20Standard%20Recording%20Code\"&gt;International Standard Recording Code&lt;/a&gt; (ISRC).\n&lt;a href=\"Best%20New%20Artist\"&gt;Best New Artist&lt;/a&gt; guidelines.\nExisting Best New Artist rules were amended to remove the album barrier given current trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted. Currently many new artists first release singles, tracks, or EPs rather than full albums. To become eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group:\nBlues categories.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Best%20Blues%20Album\"&gt;Best Blues Album&lt;/a&gt; category will branch into two distinct categories:\nIt means a return to the situation prior to 2012, the year the categories were merged in a major overhaul.\n&lt;a href=\"Best%20Rap/Sung%20Collaboration\"&gt;Best Rap/Sung Collaboration&lt;/a&gt; category renamed.\nThe Best Rap/Sung Collaboration category (in the Rap field) will be renamed as Best Rap/Sung Performance, to allow solo performances, a result of \"the current state and future trajectory of rap by expanding the category beyond collaborations between rappers and vocalists to include recordings by a solo artist who blurs the lines between rapping and singing.\"\nAdditional amendments were made to the number and type of music creators recognized in the categories of &lt;a href=\"Best%20Choral%20Performance\"&gt;Best Choral Performance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Best%20jazz%20vocal%20album\"&gt;Best Jazz Vocal Album&lt;/a&gt;."
