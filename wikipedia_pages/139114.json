    "text": "A defensive wall is a &lt;a href=\"fortification\"&gt;fortification&lt;/a&gt; usually used to protect a city, town or other settlement from potential aggressors. The walls can range from simple palisades or earthworks to extensive military fortifications with towers, bastions and gates for access to the city. From ancient to modern times, they were used to enclose settlements. Generally, these are referred to as city walls or town walls, although there were also &lt;a href=\"wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt;s, such as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wall%20of%20China\"&gt;Great Wall of China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walls%20of%20Benin\"&gt;Walls of Benin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hadrian%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Hadrian's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anastasian%20Wall\"&gt;Anastasian Wall&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Wall\"&gt;Atlantic Wall&lt;/a&gt;, which extended far beyond the borders of a &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; and were used to enclose regions or mark territorial boundaries. In mountainous terrain, defensive walls such as \"&lt;a href=\"letzi\"&gt;letzi&lt;/a&gt;s\" were used in combination with castles to seal valleys from potential attack. Beyond their defensive utility, many walls also had important symbolic functions representing the status and independence of the communities they embraced.\nExisting ancient walls are almost always &lt;a href=\"masonry\"&gt;masonry&lt;/a&gt; structures, although brick and timber-built variants are also known. Depending on the &lt;a href=\"topography\"&gt;topography&lt;/a&gt; of the area surrounding the city or the settlement the wall is intended to protect, elements of the terrain such as rivers or coastlines may be incorporated in order to make the wall more effective.\nWalls may only be crossed by entering the appropriate &lt;a href=\"city%20gate\"&gt;city gate&lt;/a&gt; and are often supplemented with &lt;a href=\"tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt;s. The practice of building these massive walls, though having its origins in prehistory, was refined during the rise of &lt;a href=\"city-state\"&gt;city-state&lt;/a&gt;s, and energetic wall-building continued into the medieval period and beyond in certain parts of Europe.\nSimpler defensive walls of earth or stone, thrown up around &lt;a href=\"hillfort\"&gt;hillfort&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ringwork\"&gt;ringwork&lt;/a&gt;s, early &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;s and the like, tend to be referred to as &lt;a href=\"rampart%20%28fortification%29\"&gt;ramparts&lt;/a&gt; or banks.\nHistory.\nMesopotamia.\nFrom very early history to modern times, walls have been a near necessity for every city. &lt;a href=\"Uruk\"&gt;Uruk&lt;/a&gt; in ancient &lt;a href=\"Sumer\"&gt;Sumer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt;) is one of the world's oldest known walled cities. Before that, the &lt;a href=\"proto-city\"&gt;proto-city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tell%20es-Sultan\"&gt;Jericho&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Bank\"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=\"Wall%20of%20Jericho%20%28Neolithic%29\"&gt;a wall&lt;/a&gt; surrounding it as early as the 8th millenniumBC. The earliest known town wall in Europe is of &lt;a href=\"Solnitsata\"&gt;Solnitsata&lt;/a&gt;, built in the 6th or 5th millennium BC.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Assyrians\"&gt;Assyrians&lt;/a&gt; deployed large labour forces to build new palaces, temples and defensive walls.\n&lt;a href=\"Babylon\"&gt;Babylon&lt;/a&gt; was one of the most famous cities of the ancient world, especially as a result of the building program of &lt;a href=\"Nebuchadnezzar\"&gt;Nebuchadnezzar&lt;/a&gt;, who expanded the walls and built the &lt;a href=\"Ishtar%20Gate\"&gt;Ishtar Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Persians built &lt;a href=\"Sasanian%20defense%20lines\"&gt;defensive walls&lt;/a&gt; to protect their territories, notably the &lt;a href=\"Derbent%20Wall\"&gt;Derbent Wall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wall%20of%20Gorgan\"&gt;Great Wall of Gorgan&lt;/a&gt; built on the either sides of the &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20Sea\"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt; against nomadic nations.\nSouth Asia.\nSome settlements in the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20Valley%20Civilization\"&gt;Indus Valley Civilization&lt;/a&gt; were also fortified. By about 3500BC, hundreds of small farming villages dotted the &lt;a href=\"Indus\"&gt;Indus&lt;/a&gt; floodplain. Many of these settlements had fortifications and planned streets. The stone and mud brick houses of &lt;a href=\"Kot%20Diji\"&gt;Kot Diji&lt;/a&gt; were clustered behind massive stone flood dykes and defensive walls, for neighboring communities quarreled constantly about the control of prime agricultural land. &lt;a href=\"Mundigak\"&gt;Mundigak&lt;/a&gt; (c. 2500BC) in present-day south-east &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; has defensive walls and square bastions of sun dried bricks.\nChina.\nLarge &lt;a href=\"rammed%20earth\"&gt;rammed earth&lt;/a&gt; walls were built in &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20China%23Ancient%20China\"&gt;ancient China&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href=\"Shang%20Dynasty\"&gt;Shang Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (c. 1600\u20131050BC), as the capital at ancient Ao had enormous walls built in this fashion (see &lt;a href=\"siege\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; for more info). Although stone walls were built in China during the &lt;a href=\"Warring%20States\"&gt;Warring States&lt;/a&gt; (481\u2013221BC), mass conversion to stone architecture did not begin in earnest until the &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Dynasty\"&gt;Tang Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (618\u2013907 AD). Sections of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wall\"&gt;Great Wall&lt;/a&gt; had been built prior to the &lt;a href=\"Qin%20Dynasty\"&gt;Qin Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (221\u2013207BC) and subsequently connected and fortified during the Qin dynasty, although its present form was mostly an engineering feat and remodeling of the &lt;a href=\"Ming%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ming Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (1368\u20131644AD). The large walls of &lt;a href=\"Pingyao\"&gt;Pingyao&lt;/a&gt; serve as one example. Likewise, the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20City\"&gt;Forbidden City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Beijing\"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; were established in the early 15th century by the &lt;a href=\"Yongle%20Emperor\"&gt;Yongle Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. According to Tonio Andrade, the immense thickness of Chinese city walls prevented larger cannons from being developed, since even industrial era artillery had trouble breaching Chinese walls.\nEurope.\nIn &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Greece\"&gt;ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;, large &lt;a href=\"stone%20wall\"&gt;stone wall&lt;/a&gt;s had been built in &lt;a href=\"Mycenaean%20Greece\"&gt;Mycenaean Greece&lt;/a&gt;, such as the ancient site of &lt;a href=\"Mycenae\"&gt;Mycenae&lt;/a&gt; (famous for the huge stone blocks of its '&lt;a href=\"cyclopean\"&gt;cyclopean&lt;/a&gt;' walls). In classical era Greece, the city of &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; built a long set of parallel stone walls called the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Walls\"&gt;Long Walls&lt;/a&gt; that reached their guarded seaport at &lt;a href=\"Piraeus\"&gt;Piraeus&lt;/a&gt;. Exceptions were few, but neither ancient &lt;a href=\"Sparta\"&gt;Sparta&lt;/a&gt; nor ancient &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; had walls for a long time, choosing to rely on their militaries for defense instead. Initially, these fortifications were simple constructions of wood and earth, which were later replaced by mixed constructions of stones piled on top of each other without &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20%28masonry%29\"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Romans&lt;/a&gt; fortified their cities with massive, mortar-bound stone walls. Among these are the largely extant &lt;a href=\"Aurelian%20Walls\"&gt;Aurelian Walls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Theodosian%20Walls\"&gt;Theodosian Walls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;, together with partial remains elsewhere. These are mostly city gates, like the &lt;a href=\"Porta%20Nigra\"&gt;Porta Nigra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Trier\"&gt;Trier&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Newport%20Arch\"&gt;Newport Arch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%2C%20Lincolnshire\"&gt;Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Central Europe, the &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celts&lt;/a&gt; built large fortified settlements which the Romans called &lt;a href=\"oppidum\"&gt;oppida&lt;/a&gt;, whose walls seem partially influenced by those built in the Mediterranean. The &lt;a href=\"fortifications\"&gt;fortifications&lt;/a&gt; were continuously expanded and improved.\nApart from these, the early &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; also saw the creation of some towns built around castles. These cities were only rarely protected by simple stone walls and more usually by a combination of both walls and &lt;a href=\"ditch%20%28fortification%29\"&gt;ditches&lt;/a&gt;. From the 12th century AD hundreds of settlements of all sizes were founded all across Europe, which very often obtained the right of fortification soon afterwards.\nThe founding of urban centers was an important means of territorial expansion and many cities, especially in central and eastern Europe, were founded for this purpose during the period of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20German%20settlement%20in%20Central%20and%20Eastern%20Europe\"&gt;Eastern settlement&lt;/a&gt;. These cities are easy to recognise due to their regular layout and large market spaces. The fortifications of these settlements were continuously improved to reflect the current level of military development.\nGunpowder era.\nChinese city walls.\nWhile gunpowder and cannons were invented in China, China never developed wall breaking artillery to the same extent as other parts of the world. Part of the reason is probably because Chinese walls were already highly resistant to artillery and discouraged increasing the size of cannons. In the mid-twentieth century a European expert in fortification commented on their immensity: \"in China \u2026 the principal towns are surrounded to the present day by walls so substantial, lofty, and formidable that the medieval fortifications of Europe are puny in comparison.\" Chinese walls were thick. The eastern wall of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Linzi\"&gt;Ancient Linzi&lt;/a&gt;, established in 859 BC, had a maximum thickness of 43 metres and an average thickness of 20-30 metres. Ming prefectural and provincial capital walls were thick at the base and at the top.\nIn Europe the height of wall construction was reached under the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, whose walls often reached in height, the same as many Chinese city walls, but were only thick. Rome's Servian Walls reached in thickness and in height. Other fortifications also reached these specifications across the empire, but all these paled in comparison to contemporary Chinese walls, which could reach a thickness of at the base in extreme cases. Even the walls of Constantinople which have been described as \"the most famous and complicated system of defence in the civilized world,\" could not match up to a major Chinese city wall. Had both the outer and inner walls of Constantinople been combined, they would have only reached roughly a bit more than a third the width of a major wall in China. According to &lt;a href=\"Philo\"&gt;Philo&lt;/a&gt; the width of a wall had to be thick to be able to withstand artillery. European walls of the 1200s and 1300s could reach the Roman equivalents but rarely exceeded them in length, width, and height, remaining around thick. It is apt to note that when referring to a very thick wall in medieval Europe, what is usually meant is a wall of in width, which would have been considered thin in a Chinese context. There are some exceptions such as the &lt;a href=\"Hillfort%20of%20Otzenhausen\"&gt;Hillfort of Otzenhausen&lt;/a&gt;, a Celtic ringfort with a thickness of in some parts, but Celtic fort-building practices died out in the early medieval period. Andrade goes on to note that the walls of the \"marketplace\" of Chang'an were thicker than the walls of major European capitals.\nAside from their immense size, Chinese walls were also structurally different from the ones built in medieval Europe. Whereas European walls were mostly constructed of stone interspersed with gravel or rubble filling and bonded by limestone mortar, Chinese walls had tamped earthen cores which absorbed the energy of artillery shots. Walls were constructed using wooden frameworks which were filled with layers of earth tamped down to a highly compact state, and once that was completed the frameworks were removed for use in the next wall section. Starting from the Song dynasty these walls were improved with an outer layer of bricks or stone to prevent corrosion, and during the Ming, earthworks were interspersed with stone and rubble. Most Chinese walls were also sloped rather than vertical to better deflect projectile energy.\nThe Chinese Wall Theory essentially rests on a cost benefit hypothesis, where the Ming recognized the highly resistant nature of their walls to structural damage, and could not imagine any affordable development of the guns available to them at the time to be capable of breaching said walls. Even as late as the 1490s a Florentine diplomat considered the French claim that \"their artillery is capable of creating a breach in a wall of eight feet in thickness\" to be ridiculous and the French \"braggarts by nature\". In fact \"twentieth\" century explosive shells had some difficulty creating a breach in tamped earthen walls.\nBastions and star forts.\nAs a response to gunpowder artillery, European fortifications began displaying architectural principles such as lower and thicker walls in the mid-1400s. Cannon towers were built with artillery rooms where cannons could discharge fire from slits in the walls. However this proved problematic as the slow rate of fire, reverberating concussions, and noxious fumes produced greatly hindered defenders. Gun towers also limited the size and number of cannon placements because the rooms could only be built so big. Notable surviving artillery towers include a seven layer defensive structure built in 1480 at &lt;a href=\"Foug%C3%A8res\"&gt;Foug\u00e8res&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brittany\"&gt;Brittany&lt;/a&gt;, and a four layer tower built in 1479 at Querfurth in Saxony.\nThe star fort, also known as the bastion fort, \"trace italienne\", or renaissance fortress, was a style of fortification that became popular in Europe during the 16th century. The bastion and star fort was developed in Italy, where the Florentine engineer &lt;a href=\"Giuliano%20da%20Sangallo\"&gt;Giuliano da Sangallo&lt;/a&gt; (1445\u20131516) compiled a comprehensive defensive plan using the geometric &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt; and full \"trace italienne\" that became widespread in Europe.\nThe main distinguishing features of the star fort were its angle bastions, each placed to support their neighbor with lethal crossfire, covering all angles, making them extremely difficult to engage with and attack. Angle bastions consisted of two faces and two flanks. Artillery positions positioned at the flanks could fire parallel into the opposite bastion's line of fire, thus providing two lines of cover fire against an armed assault on the wall, and preventing mining parties from finding refuge. Meanwhile, artillery positioned on the bastion platform could fire frontally from the two faces, also providing overlapping fire with the opposite bastion. Overlapping mutually supporting defensive fire was the greatest advantage enjoyed by the star fort. As a result, sieges lasted longer and became more difficult affairs. By the 1530s the bastion fort had become the dominant defensive structure in Italy.\nOutside Europe, the star fort became an \"engine of European expansion,\" and acted as a force multiplier so that small European garrisons could hold out against numerically superior forces. Wherever star forts were erected the natives experienced great difficulty in uprooting European invaders.\nIn China, &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Yuanhua\"&gt;Sun Yuanhua&lt;/a&gt; advocated for the construction of angled &lt;a href=\"bastion%20forts\"&gt;bastion forts&lt;/a&gt; in his \"Xifashenji\" so that their cannons could better support each other. The officials Han Yun and Han Lin noted that cannons on square forts could not support each side as well as bastion forts. Their efforts to construct bastion forts and their results were inconclusive. Ma Weicheng built two bastion forts in his home county, which helped fend off a &lt;a href=\"Qing%20dynasty\"&gt;Qing&lt;/a&gt; incursion in 1638. By 1641, there were ten bastion forts in the county. Before bastion forts could be spread any further, the Ming dynasty fell in 1644, and they were largely forgotten as the Qing dynasty was on the offensive most of the time and had no use for them.\nDecline.\nIn the wake of city growth and the ensuing change of defensive strategy, focusing more on the defense of &lt;a href=\"fort\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt;s around cities, many city walls were demolished. Also, the invention of gunpowder rendered walls less effective, as siege cannons could then be used to blast through walls, allowing armies to simply march through. Today, the presence of former city fortifications can often only be deduced from the presence of ditches, &lt;a href=\"ring%20road\"&gt;ring road&lt;/a&gt;s or parks.\nFurthermore, some street names hint at the presence of fortifications in times past, for example when words such as \"wall\" or \"glacis\" occur. &lt;a href=\"Wall%20Street\"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, itself a &lt;a href=\"metonym\"&gt;metonym&lt;/a&gt; for the entire United States financial system, is one example.\nIn the 19th century, less emphasis was placed on preserving the fortifications for the sake of their architectural or historical value on the one hand, complete fortifications were restored (&lt;a href=\"Carcassonne\"&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt;), on the other hand many structures were demolished in an effort to modernize the cities. One exception to this is the \"monument preservation\" law by the Bavarian King &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20I%20of%20Bavaria\"&gt;Ludwig I of Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the nearly complete preservation of many monuments such as the &lt;a href=\"Rothenburg%20ob%20der%20Tauber\"&gt;Rothenburg ob der Tauber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"N%C3%B6rdlingen\"&gt;N\u00f6rdlingen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dinkelsb%C3%BChl\"&gt;Dinkelsb\u00fchl&lt;/a&gt;. The countless small fortified towns in the &lt;a href=\"Franconia\"&gt;Franconia&lt;/a&gt; region were also preserved as a consequence of this edict.\nModern era.\nWalls and fortified wall structures were still built in the modern era. They did not, however, have the original purpose of being a structure able to resist a prolonged siege or bombardment. Modern examples of defensive walls include:\nAdditionally, in some countries, different embassies may be grouped together in a single \"embassy district\", enclosed by a fortified complex with walls and towersthis usually occurs in regions where the embassies run a high risk of being target of attacks. An early example of such a compound was the &lt;a href=\"Beijing%20Legation%20Quarter\"&gt;Legation Quarter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Beijing\"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nMost of these modern city walls are made of steel and concrete. Vertical concrete plates are put together so as to allow the least space in between them, and are rooted firmly in the ground. The top of the wall is often protruding and beset with &lt;a href=\"barbed%20wire\"&gt;barbed wire&lt;/a&gt; in order to make climbing them more difficult. These walls are usually built in straight lines and covered by watchtowers at the corners. Double walls with an interstitial \"zone of fire\", as the former Berlin Wall had, are now rare.\nIn September 2014, Ukraine announced the construction of the \"European Rampart\" alongside its &lt;a href=\"Russia%E2%80%93Ukraine%20barrier\"&gt;border with Russia&lt;/a&gt; to be able to successfully apply for a visa-free movement with the European Union.\nComposition.\nAt its simplest, a defensive wall consists of a wall enclosure and its gates. For the most part, the top of the walls were accessible, with the outside of the walls having tall &lt;a href=\"parapet\"&gt;parapet&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"embrasure\"&gt;embrasure&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"merlon\"&gt;merlon&lt;/a&gt;s. North of the Alps, this passageway at the top of the walls occasionally had a roof.\nIn addition to this, many different enhancements were made over the course of the centuries:\nThe defensive towers of west and south European fortifications in the Middle Ages were often very regularly and uniformly constructed (cf. &lt;a href=\"%C3%81vila%2C%20Spain\"&gt;\u00c1vila&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Provins\"&gt;Provins&lt;/a&gt;), whereas Central European city walls tend to show a variety of different styles. In these cases the gate and wall towers often reach up to considerable heights, and gates equipped with two towers on either side are much rarer. Apart from having a purely military and defensive purpose, towers also played a representative and artistic role in the conception of a fortified complex. The architecture of the city thus competed with that of the castle of the noblemen and city walls were often a manifestation of the pride of a particular city.\nUrban areas outside the city walls, so-called &lt;a href=\"Vorstadt\"&gt;Vorst\u00e4dte&lt;/a&gt;, were often enclosed by their own set of walls and integrated into the defense of the city. These areas were often inhabited by the poorer population and held the \"noxious trades\". In many cities, a new wall was built once the city had grown outside of the old wall. This can often still be seen in the layout of the city, for example in &lt;a href=\"N%C3%B6rdlingen\"&gt;N\u00f6rdlingen&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes even a few of the old gate towers are preserved, such as the \"white tower\" in &lt;a href=\"Nuremberg\"&gt;Nuremberg&lt;/a&gt;. Additional constructions prevented the circumvention of the city, through which many important trade routes passed, thus ensuring that tolls were paid when the caravans passed through the city gates, and that the local market was visited by the trade caravans.\nFurthermore, additional signaling and observation towers were frequently built outside the city, and were sometimes fortified in a castle-like fashion. The border of the area of influence of the city was often partially or fully defended by elaborate ditches, walls and hedges. The crossing points were usually guarded by gates or gate houses. These defenses were regularly checked by riders, who often also served as the gate keepers. Long stretches of these defenses can still be seen to this day, and even some gates are still intact. To further protect their territory, rich cities also established castles in their area of influence. An example of this practice is the Romanian &lt;a href=\"Bran%20Castle\"&gt;Bran Castle&lt;/a&gt;, which was intended to protect nearby Kronstadt (today's &lt;a href=\"Bra%C5%9Fov\"&gt;Bra\u015fov&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe city walls were often connected to the fortifications of hill castles via additional walls. Thus the defenses were made up of city and castle fortifications taken together. Several examples of this are preserved, for example in Germany &lt;a href=\"Hirschhorn%20%28Neckar%29\"&gt;Hirschhorn&lt;/a&gt; on the Neckar, &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6nigsberg\"&gt;K\u00f6nigsberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pappenheim\"&gt;Pappenheim&lt;/a&gt;, Franken, &lt;a href=\"Burghausen%2C%20Alt%C3%B6tting\"&gt;Burghausen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oberbayern\"&gt;Oberbayern&lt;/a&gt; and many more.\nA few castles were more directly incorporated into the defensive strategy of the city (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Nuremberg\"&gt;Nuremberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zons\"&gt;Zons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carcassonne\"&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt;), or the cities were directly outside the castle as a sort of \"pre-castle\" (Coucy-le-Chateau, &lt;a href=\"Conwy\"&gt;Conwy&lt;/a&gt; and others). Larger cities often had multiple stewards for example &lt;a href=\"Augsburg\"&gt;Augsburg&lt;/a&gt; was divided into a &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Free%20City\"&gt;Reichstadt&lt;/a&gt; and a clerical city. These different parts were often separated by their own fortifications."
