It is organised by &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Africa\"&gt;Rugby Africa&lt;/a&gt; and was also known as the CAR Super 16. The tournament contains the teams in the second division of African rugby, below those playing in the &lt;a href=\"Africa%20Cup\"&gt;Africa Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The competition is divided into north and south sections with two pools of four in each section. The winners of these pools will go on to play each other in the final where the winner of both north and south will be found."
