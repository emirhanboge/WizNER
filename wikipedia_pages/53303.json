    "text": "Nuuk (; , formerly ) is the &lt;a href=\"capital%20%28political%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20and%20towns%20in%20Greenland\"&gt;largest city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Nuuk is the seat of &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Greenland\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; and the country's largest cultural and economic centre. The major cities from other countries closest to the capital are &lt;a href=\"Iqaluit\"&gt;Iqaluit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador\"&gt;St. John's&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;. Nuuk contains almost a third of Greenland's population and its tallest building. Nuuk is also the seat of government for the &lt;a href=\"Sermersooq\"&gt;Sermersooq&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"municipalities%20of%20Greenland\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt;. In January 2021, it had a population of 18,800.\nThe city was founded in 1728 by the Dano-Norwegian governor &lt;a href=\"Claus%20Paarss\"&gt;Claus Paarss&lt;/a&gt; when he relocated &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Egede\"&gt;Hans Egede&lt;/a&gt;'s earlier Hope Colony () to the mainland and was named \"Godthaab\" (\"Good Hope\"). \"Nuuk\" is the &lt;a href=\"Greenlandic%20language\"&gt;Greenlandic&lt;/a&gt; word for \"&lt;a href=\"headland\"&gt;cape&lt;/a&gt;\" () and is commonly found in Greenlandic place names. It is so named because of its position at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Nuup%20Kangerlua\"&gt;Nuup Kangerlua&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fjord\"&gt;fjord&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern shore of the &lt;a href=\"Labrador%20Sea\"&gt;Labrador Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Its &lt;a href=\"latitude\"&gt;latitude&lt;/a&gt;, at 64\u00b011' N, makes it the world's &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20northernmost%20items\"&gt;northernmost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20national%20capitals%20by%20latitude\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;, only a few kilometres farther north than the Icelandic capital &lt;a href=\"Reykjav%C3%ADk\"&gt;Reykjav\u00edk&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"home%20rule\"&gt;home rule&lt;/a&gt; was established in 1979, the authorization of place names was transferred to Greenlandic authorities, who subsequently preferred Greenlandic names over Danish ones. The name \"Godth\u00e5b\" mostly went out of use over the next two decades.\nThe campus of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Greenland\"&gt;University of Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, hosting &lt;a href=\"Statistics%20Greenland\"&gt;Statistics Greenland&lt;/a&gt; and the main holdings of the &lt;a href=\"Public%20and%20National%20Library%20of%20Greenland\"&gt;Public and National Library of Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, are at the northern end of the district, near the road to &lt;a href=\"Nuuk%20Airport\"&gt;Nuuk Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nNuuk receives its electric power mainly from the renewable energy-powered &lt;a href=\"Buksefjord%20hydroelectric%20power%20plant\"&gt;Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant&lt;/a&gt; by way of a 132 kV powerline crossing &lt;a href=\"Ameralik%20Span\"&gt;Ameralik fjord&lt;/a&gt; over a distance of , the world's longest free span.\nHistory.\nThe site has a long history of habitation. The area around Nuuk was first occupied by the ancient, pre-Inuit, &lt;a href=\"Paleo-Eskimo\"&gt;Paleo-Eskimo&lt;/a&gt; people of the &lt;a href=\"Saqqaq%20culture\"&gt;Saqqaq culture&lt;/a&gt; as far back as 2200 BC when they lived in the area around the now abandoned settlement of &lt;a href=\"Qoornoq\"&gt;Qoornoq&lt;/a&gt;. For a long time, it was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Dorset%20culture\"&gt;Dorset culture&lt;/a&gt; around the former settlement of &lt;a href=\"Kangeq\"&gt;Kangeq&lt;/a&gt;, but they disappeared from the Nuuk district before AD 1000. The Nuuk area was later inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Vikings\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt; explorers in the 10th century (&lt;a href=\"Western%20Settlement\"&gt;Western Settlement&lt;/a&gt;), and shortly thereafter by &lt;a href=\"Inuit\"&gt;Inuit&lt;/a&gt; peoples. Inuit and Norsemen both lived with little interaction in this area from about 1000 until the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Norsemen\"&gt;Norse&lt;/a&gt; settlement &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Greenland%23Norse%20settlement\"&gt;for uncertain reasons&lt;/a&gt; during the 15th century.\nThe city proper was founded as the fort of Godt-Haab in 1728 by the &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20governors%20of%20Greenland\"&gt;royal governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Claus%20Paarss\"&gt;Claus Paarss&lt;/a&gt;, when he relocated the missionary and merchant &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Egede\"&gt;Hans Egede&lt;/a&gt;'s earlier Hope Colony () from &lt;a href=\"Kangeq%20Island\"&gt;Kangeq Island&lt;/a&gt; to the mainland. At that time, Greenland was formally still a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20possessions%20of%20Norway%23Former%20dependencies%20and%20homelands\"&gt;Norwegian colony&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Kiel\"&gt;until 1814&lt;/a&gt;) under the united &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Dano-Norwegian Crown&lt;/a&gt;, but the colony had not had any contact for over three centuries. Paarss's colonists consisted of mutinous soldiers, convicts, and prostitutes and most died within the first year of scurvy and other ailments. In 1733 and 1734, a &lt;a href=\"smallpox\"&gt;smallpox&lt;/a&gt; epidemic killed most of the native population as well as Egede's wife. Hans Egede went back to Denmark in 1736 after 15 years in Greenland, leaving his son &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Egede\"&gt;Poul&lt;/a&gt; to continue his work. Godthaab became the seat of government for the Danish colony of &lt;a href=\"South%20Greenland\"&gt;South Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Godhavn\"&gt;Godhavn&lt;/a&gt; (modern Qeqertarsuaq) was the capital of &lt;a href=\"North%20Greenland\"&gt;North Greenland&lt;/a&gt; until 1940, when the administration was unified in Godthaab.\nIn 1733, &lt;a href=\"Moravian%20mission%20in%20Greenland\"&gt;Moravian missionaries&lt;/a&gt; received permission to begin a mission on the island; in 1747, there were enough converts to prompt the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Moravian%20Brethren%20Mission%20House\"&gt;Moravian Brethren Mission House&lt;/a&gt; and the formal establishment of the mission as New Herrnhut (). This became the nucleus for present-day Nuuk as many Greenlanders from the southeastern coast left their territory to live at the mission station. From this base, further missions were established at &lt;a href=\"Lichtenfels%2C%20Greenland\"&gt;Lichtenfels&lt;/a&gt; (1748), &lt;a href=\"Lichtenau%2C%20Greenland\"&gt;Lichtenau&lt;/a&gt; (1774), &lt;a href=\"Friedrichsthal%2C%20Greenland\"&gt;Friedrichsthal&lt;/a&gt; (1824), &lt;a href=\"Umanak%20%28mission%29\"&gt;Umanak&lt;/a&gt; (1861), and &lt;a href=\"Idlorpait\"&gt;Idlorpait&lt;/a&gt; (1864), before they were discontinued in 1900 and folded into the Lutheran &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Church of Denmark&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround 1850, Greenland, and especially the area around Nuuk, were in crisis. The Europeans had brought diseases and a culture that conflicted with the ways of the native Greenlanders. Many Greenlanders were living in poverty. In 1853, &lt;a href=\"Hinrich%20Johannes%20Rink\"&gt;Hinrich Johannes Rink&lt;/a&gt; came to Greenland and perceived the Greenlanders had lost much of their culture and identity under Danish influence. In response, in 1861, he started the \"&lt;a href=\"Atuagagdliutt\"&gt;Atuagagdliutt&lt;/a&gt;\", Greenland's first newspaper, with a native Greenlander as editor. This newspaper based in Nuuk later became significant for the Greenlandic identity.\nOn Oct. 3, 1888, Norwegian explorer &lt;a href=\"Fridtjof%20Nansen\"&gt;Fridtjof Nansen&lt;/a&gt; reached Godthaab, completing a trek which began on August 11 in &lt;a href=\"Umivik%20Bay\"&gt;Umivik Bay&lt;/a&gt; on Greenland's east coast. His was the first European party to cross Greenland successfully. The group spent the next seven months there awaiting a ship back to Norway. \nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, there was a reawakening of Greenlandic national identity. Greenlanders shared a written language and assembled a council under &lt;a href=\"Eske%20Brun\"&gt;Eske Brun&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership in Nuuk. In 1940, an American and a Canadian Consulate were established in Nuuk. Under new regulations in 1950, two councils amalgamated into one. This Countryside Council was abolished on 1 May 1979, when the city of Godth\u00e5b was renamed Nuuk by the Greenland Home Rule government. The city boomed during the 1950s when &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; began to modernise Greenland. As in Greenland as a whole, Nuuk is populated today by both Inuit and &lt;a href=\"Danish%20people\"&gt;Danes&lt;/a&gt;. Over a third of Greenland's total population lives in the Nuuk Greater Metropolitan area.\nAn article examining indigenous influences on cities worldwide suggested,\nGeography.\nNuuk is located at approximately at the mouth of Nuup Kangerlua (formerly Baal's River), some from the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Labrador%20Sea\"&gt;Labrador Sea&lt;/a&gt; on the southwestern coast of Greenland, and about south of the &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Circle\"&gt;Arctic Circle&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, the fjord flows to the northwest, to then turn southwest at , splitting into three arms in its lower run, with three big islands in between the arms: &lt;a href=\"Sermitsiaq%20Island\"&gt;Sermitsiaq Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qeqertarsuaq%20Island%20%28Nuuk%29\"&gt;Qeqertarsuaq Island&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Qoornuup%20Qeqertarsua\"&gt;Qoornuup Qeqertarsua&lt;/a&gt;. The fjord widens into a bay dotted with &lt;a href=\"Skerry\"&gt;skerries&lt;/a&gt; near its mouth, opening into Labrador Sea at approximately . Some to the northeast, reaching a height of , &lt;a href=\"Sermitsiaq%20%28mountain%29\"&gt;Sermitsiaq&lt;/a&gt; can be seen from almost everywhere in Nuuk. The mountain has given its name to the nationwide newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Sermitsiaq%20%28newspaper%29\"&gt;Sermitsiaq&lt;/a&gt;\". Closer to the town are the peaks of &lt;a href=\"Store%20Malene\"&gt;Store Malene&lt;/a&gt;, , and &lt;a href=\"Lille%20Malene\"&gt;Lille Malene&lt;/a&gt;, . The &lt;a href=\"magnetic%20declination\"&gt;magnetic declination&lt;/a&gt; at Nuuk is extreme.\nClimate.\nNuuk has a maritime-influenced &lt;a href=\"tundra%20climate\"&gt;tundra climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; \"ET\") with cold, long, snowy winters and cool, short summers. Although the winters in Nuuk are relatively cold, they are milder compared to other tundra climates, such as in &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; or parts of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Siberia\"&gt;Eastern Siberia&lt;/a&gt;. On 21 December, the shortest day and longest night of the year, the sun rises at 10:30 A.M. and sets at 2:20\u00a0pm. By contrast, on the longest day and shortest night of the year, 21 June, the sun rises at 2:54 A.M. and does not set until 12:04 A.M, giving a quasi-&lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Sun\"&gt;Midnight Sun&lt;/a&gt;. Nuuk can have mild temperatures on brief occasions year-round, with each month having recorded or warmer, although only June, July, August, and September have recorded what could be considered hot weather (defined as or higher). The monthly averages range from to , whereas all-time extremes range from on 14 January 1984 to on 6 July 2008. The record wind in Nuuk is 68 km/h.\nThe average monthly temperature ( in August) is colder than what is considered the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20line\"&gt;limit for trees&lt;/a&gt; ( during the warmest month). There are a few planted trees which do not sustain well.\nDemographics.\nWith 18,800 inhabitants as of January 2021, Nuuk is by far the largest town in Greenland. The population of Nuuk has doubled since 1977, increased by over a third since 1990, and risen by almost 21% since 2000. In addition to those born in Greenland, data from 2015 showed 3,826 were born outside the country. Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, Danes have continued to settle in the town. Today, Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland. Half of Greenland's immigrants live in Nuuk, which also accounts for a quarter of the country's native population.\nGovernment.\nAs the capital of Greenland, Nuuk is the administrative centre of the country, containing all of the important government buildings and institutions. The public sector bodies are also the town's largest employer.\nAs of January 2021, the mayor of Nuuk is Charlotte Ludvigsen. She replaced former mayor &lt;a href=\"Asii%20Chemnitz%20Narup\"&gt;Asii Chemnitz Narup&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 following a social media scandal involving posts criticizing her party. Like Narup, Ludvigsen is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Inuit%20Ataqatigiit\"&gt;Inuit Ataqatigiit&lt;/a&gt; party.\nGreenland's &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Greenland\"&gt;self-government parliament&lt;/a&gt;, the Inatsisartut, is in Nuuk. It has 31 seats and its members are elected by popular vote on the basis of &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt; to serve four-year terms. All of Greenland's major political parties have their headquarters in Nuuk, including the Inuit Ataqatigiit, &lt;a href=\"Siumut\"&gt;Siumut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Democrats%20%28Greenland%29\"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atassut\"&gt;Atassut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Candidates\"&gt;Association of Candidates&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Party%20%28Greenland%29\"&gt;Women's Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nKANUKOKA.\nKANUKOKA () was based in Nuuk. It was an association of Greenland's municipalities, led by Enok Sandgreen. The aim of the organisation was to facilitate cooperation among all five municipalities of Greenland: &lt;a href=\"Avannaata\"&gt;Avannaata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kujalleq\"&gt;Kujalleq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qeqertalik\"&gt;Qeqertalik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qeqqata\"&gt;Qeqqata&lt;/a&gt;, and Sermersooq. However, Sermersooq and Qeqertalik both withdrew and KANUKOKA was dissolved as of Tuesday, 31 July, 2018. The organisation ran the municipal elections every four years, with the last election taking place in 2016. All municipal authorities in Greenland were members of the organisation up until its 2018 dissolution. The association was overseen by &lt;a href=\"Maliina%20Abelsen\"&gt;Maliina Abelsen&lt;/a&gt;, the Minister for Social Affairs in the Government of Greenland.\nEconomy.\nAlthough only a small town, Nuuk has developed trade, business, shipping and other industries. It began as a small fishing settlement with a harbor, but as the economy developed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, the fishing industry in the capital declined. The port is nevertheless still home to almost half of Greenland's fishing fleet. The local &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Greenland\"&gt;Royal Greenland&lt;/a&gt; processing plant absorbs landed seafood amounting to over DKK 50 million (US$7\u00a0million) per annum, mainly (80%) &lt;a href=\"shrimp\"&gt;shrimp&lt;/a&gt;, but also &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lumpfish\"&gt;lumpfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"halibut\"&gt;halibut&lt;/a&gt;. Seafood, including seal, is also sold in abundance in Nuuk's fish markets, the largest being &lt;a href=\"Kalaaliaraq%20Market\"&gt;Kalaaliaraq Market&lt;/a&gt;. Minerals including &lt;a href=\"zinc\"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; have contributed to the development of Nuuk's economy.\nThe city, like much of Greenland, is heavily dependent upon Danish investment and relies on Denmark for block funding.\nEnergy.\nAll of Greenland's electricity is supplied by the government-owned company &lt;a href=\"Nukissiorfiit\"&gt;Nukissiorfiit&lt;/a&gt;, which has a &lt;a href=\"monopoly\"&gt;monopoly&lt;/a&gt; on the electricity in Greenland. Since 1993, Nuuk has received its electric power mainly from &lt;a href=\"Buksefjord%20hydroelectric%20power%20plant\"&gt;Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant&lt;/a&gt; by way of a 132\u00a0kV powerline crossing &lt;a href=\"Ameralik%20Span\"&gt;Ameralik fjord&lt;/a&gt; over a distance of , the world's longest free span.\nEducation.\nNuuk has several educational institutions of higher learning. The &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Greenland\"&gt;University of Greenland&lt;/a&gt; (Ilisimatusarfik), the only university in Greenland, is in Nuuk. The university was founded in 1987 and expanded in 2007 with the new building, \"Ilimmarfik\", housing departments of journalism, management and economics, language, literature and media, cultural and social history, theology and religion and social work. Nuuk is also home to the Department of Learning (Ilinniarfissuaq), the oldest educational facility in Greenland, in the old colonial part of Nuuk (\"Nuutoqaq\": Old Nuuk). Other notable educational institutions include the Department of Nursing and Health Science, Nuuk Technical College and the Iron &amp; Metal School.\nHealthcare.\nThe city is served by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ingrid%27s%20Hospital\"&gt;Queen Ingrid's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. The hospital not only serves as the main hospital for the municipality but is the central hospital in all of Greenland. The hospital has 185 beds.\nTourism.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nuuk%20Tourist%20Office\"&gt;Nuuk Tourist Office&lt;/a&gt; was built in 1992 to house the headquarters of the new National Tourist Board of Greenland.\nShopping.\nShops in Nuuk offer local art and craftwork. In July 2012, Greenland's first shopping centre, &lt;a href=\"Nuuk%20Center\"&gt;Nuuk Center&lt;/a&gt; \"(NC)\", opened. The centre has Greenland's first underground parking. Several supermarkets exist, such as Nuuk Center, &lt;a href=\"Pisiffik\"&gt;Pisiffik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brugseni\"&gt;Brugseni&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spar%20%28retailer%29\"&gt;Spar&lt;/a&gt;.\nTransportation.\nAirport.\nNuuk has an international airport to the northeast of the town centre. Built in 1979, it is a hub for &lt;a href=\"Air%20Greenland\"&gt;Air Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, which is also headquartered in Nuuk and operates its technical base at the airport. There are flights inside Greenland and to Iceland. A decision has been made to extend the runway to allow for flights to European destinations, such as Denmark.\nSea.\nAs a result of the high cost of flying goods to Greenland, Nuuk and other towns in Greenland are connected to Denmark by cargo vessels which sail mainly from &lt;a href=\"Aalborg\"&gt;Aalborg&lt;/a&gt; during the warmer months after the winter ice has melted. They bring clothing, flour, medicine, timber and machinery and return with deep-frozen shrimp and fish. For most of the year, Nuuk is served twice-weekly by the coastal ferry of the &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Umiaq%20Line\"&gt;Arctic Umiaq Line&lt;/a&gt;, which links the communities of the western coast.\nRoadways.\nThe majority of buses and cars owned in Greenland operate in Nuuk. There are no roads connecting Nuuk with other areas of Greenland. The main street in Nuuk is &lt;a href=\"Aqqusinersuaq\"&gt;Aqqusinersuaq&lt;/a&gt;, with a number of shops and the 140-room &lt;a href=\"Hotel%20Hans%20Egede\"&gt;Hotel Hans Egede&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 2009, the city bus service Nuup Bussii provides city transport services in Nuuk for the &lt;a href=\"Sermersooq\"&gt;Sermersooq&lt;/a&gt; municipality, linking the town centre with the airport, the outlying districts and neighborhoods of &lt;a href=\"Nuussuaq%20%28district%29\"&gt;Nuussuaq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qinngorput\"&gt;Qinngorput&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Qernertunnguit\"&gt;Qernertunnguit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quassussuup%20Tungaa\"&gt;Quassussuup Tungaa&lt;/a&gt;. In 2012, the buses transported more than 2 million passengers around the city of Nuuk.\nCityscape.\nHistorical buildings.\n&lt;a href=\"Hans%20Egede%20House\"&gt;Hans Egede's House&lt;/a&gt;, built in 1721 by the Norwegian missionary Hans Egede, is the oldest building in Greenland. Standing close to the harbour among other old houses, it is now used for government receptions.\nThe Church of Our Saviour of the &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diocese%20of%20Greenland\"&gt;diocese of Greenland&lt;/a&gt; was built in 1849, and the tower was added in 1884. The red building with a clock tower and steeple is a prominent site on the landscape. The church received the status of &lt;a href=\"Nuuk%20Cathedral\"&gt;Nuuk Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; in 1994, when the first bishop was Kristian M\u00f8rk, followed in 1995 by Sofie Petersen, a native of Greenland and the second woman in Denmark to become a bishop.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Herrnhut%20House\"&gt;Herrnhut House&lt;/a&gt; was the centre of the &lt;a href=\"Moravian%20missions%20in%20Greenland\"&gt;Moravian mission&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Neu-Herrnhut\"&gt;New Herrnhut&lt;/a&gt;. Other landmarks include the &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Egede%20Church\"&gt;Hans Egede Church&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Hans%20Egede\"&gt;Statue of Hans Egede&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Greenland%20National%20Museum\"&gt;Greenland National Museum&lt;/a&gt; is in Nuuk and was one of the first museums established in Greenland, inaugurated in the mid-1960s. The museum has many artifacts and exhibits related to Greenland's archaeology, history, art, and handicrafts, and contains the &lt;a href=\"Qilakitsoq\"&gt;Qilakitsoq&lt;/a&gt; mummies.\nCultural.\nKatuaq is a &lt;a href=\"cultural%20centre\"&gt;cultural centre&lt;/a&gt; used for concerts, films, art exhibitions, and conferences. It was designed by &lt;a href=\"Schmidt%20Hammer%20Lassen\"&gt;Schmidt Hammer Lassen&lt;/a&gt; and inaugurated on 15 February 1997. Katuaq contains two &lt;a href=\"auditorium\"&gt;auditoria&lt;/a&gt;, the larger seating 1,008 people and the smaller, 508. The complex also contains an art school, library, meeting facilities, administrative offices and a caf\u00e9.\nThe Nuuk Art Museum is the only private art and crafts museum in Greenland. The museum contains a notable collection of local paintings, watercolours, drawings, and graphics, some by Andy Warhol; and figures in soapstone, ivory, and wood, with many items collected by archaeologists.\nEducational.\nIlisimatusarfik, the University of Greenland, is in Nuuk and is the national university of Greenland. Most courses are taught in &lt;a href=\"Danish%20language\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt;, although a few are in Kalaallisut as well. , the university had approximately 150 students (almost all Greenlanders), around 14 academic staff, and five administrators. Its library holds approximately 30,000 volumes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Public%20and%20National%20Library%20of%20Greenland\"&gt;National Library of Greenland&lt;/a&gt; in Nuuk is the largest reference library in the country, devoted to the preservation of Greenland's cultural heritage and history. The library holdings are split between the public library in the town centre and Ilimmarfik, the campus of the University of Greenland. As of 1 January 2008, there are 83,324 items in the library database at Ilimmarfik.\nSports.\nNuuk's sports clubs include &lt;a href=\"Nuuk%20Idraetslag\"&gt;Nuuk IL&lt;/a&gt; (established in 1934), &lt;a href=\"B-67\"&gt;B-67&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gr%C3%B8nlands%20Seminarius%20Sportklub\"&gt;GSS Nuuk&lt;/a&gt;. Nuuk Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium, used mostly for &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; games. The stadium has a capacity of 2,000. The stadium can also be used as an entertainment venue: the Scottish rock band &lt;a href=\"Nazareth%20%28band%29\"&gt;Nazareth&lt;/a&gt; performed at the venue. Nuuk also has the &lt;a href=\"Godth%C3%A5bhallen\"&gt;Godth\u00e5bhallen&lt;/a&gt;, a handball stadium.
