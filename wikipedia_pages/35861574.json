    "text": "G\u00e9za Gyim\u00f3thy (born 12 March 1952) is a former &lt;a href=\"Hungary\"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; politician, who served as one of the &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20Speaker%20of%20the%20National%20Assembly%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Deputy Speakers of the National Assembly of Hungary&lt;/a&gt; from 18 June 1998 to 19 September 2001.\nPolitical career.\nGyim\u00f3thy joined &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Democratic%20Forum\"&gt;Hungarian Democratic Forum&lt;/a&gt; (MDF) in 1988 and formed the party's basic organization in &lt;a href=\"Tata%2C%20Hungary\"&gt;Tata&lt;/a&gt;. However he quit the party one year later, because he considered the party's leadership was compromising. After that he became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Smallholders%2C%20Agrarian%20Workers%20and%20Civic%20Party\"&gt;Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party&lt;/a&gt; (FKGP) on 12 January 1990. He served as chairman of the party in his birthplace between 1990 and 1991. He was a strong supporter of &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zsef%20Torgy%C3%A1n\"&gt;J\u00f3zsef Torgy\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe unsuccessfully ran for the parliamentary seat for &lt;a href=\"Kom%C3%A1rom-Esztergom%20County\"&gt;Kom\u00e1rom-Esztergom County&lt;/a&gt; 5th Constituency in the &lt;a href=\"1990%20Hungarian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;elections in 1990&lt;/a&gt;. He became Deputy Chairman of the Independent Smallholders Party in July 1994. He was elected to a member of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"1994%20Hungarian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1994 elections&lt;/a&gt; from the party's National List. He was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Hungarian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1998 elections&lt;/a&gt;, Gyim\u00f3thy became a deputy speaker of the parliament. He frequently used yellow and red cards to rebuke of MPs. In 2000, former &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gyula%20Horn\"&gt;Gyula Horn&lt;/a&gt; called FKGP leader Torgy\u00e1n as \"Pubi\", that is why Gyim\u00f3thy called him to order. Horn answered: \"This is offensive? Do not be silly, G\u00e9za!\" This moment became a political anecdote in Hungary.\nIn 2001-2002 the FKGP split into two parts and Gyim\u00f3thy's relation with the Party Chairman decayed. He was a candidate for the position of &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Agriculture%20%28Hungary%29\"&gt;Minister of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, when Torgy\u00e1n resigned, however he was expelled from the party by Torgy\u00e1n. As a result, Gyim\u00f3thy also lost his legislative deputy speaker function. After the failure &lt;a href=\"2002%20Hungarian%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2002 Hungarian parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; for the FKGP, he retired from the politics.\nTrivia.\nG\u00e9za Gyim\u00f3thy was one of the founders of the \"Szen\u00e1-torok\", the official choir of the National Assembly of Hungary."
