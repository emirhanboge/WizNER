This came despite interest from other clubs. He made his &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; debut at the &lt;a href=\"County%20Ground%20%28Swindon%29\"&gt;County Ground&lt;/a&gt; on 7 August 2010, in a 2\u20131 defeat to &lt;a href=\"Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Brighton &amp; Hove Albion&lt;/a&gt;, but was &lt;a href=\"substitute%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Alan%20O%27Brien\"&gt;Alan O'Brien&lt;/a&gt; after sixty minutes for tactical reasons.

He scored a brace eleven days later in a 5\u20134 defeat at &lt;a href=\"Peterborough%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Peterborough United&lt;/a&gt;. He was then benched in favour of Charlie Austin and &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20P%C3%A9ricard\"&gt;Vincent P\u00e9ricard&lt;/a&gt;, returning to the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Manchester%20Stadium\"&gt;City of Manchester Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in January after scoring a total of three goals in nine starts and 12 substitute appearances for Swindon.\nPeterborough United.\nBall signed a -year deal for &lt;a href=\"Darren%20Ferguson\"&gt;Darren Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;'s Peterborough United on 31 January 2011 after being bought for an undisclosed transfer fee.

However Ball returned to League One on loan at &lt;a href=\"Rochdale%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Rochdale&lt;/a&gt; on 31 August after Peterborough signed &lt;a href=\"Emile%20Sinclair\"&gt;Emile Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Macclesfield%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Macclesfield Town&lt;/a&gt;. He scored four goals in eight games for the \"Dale\", which led to him being recalled to &lt;a href=\"London%20Road%20Stadium\"&gt;London Road&lt;/a&gt; on 10 October to compete with &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201987%29\"&gt;Paul Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and Emile Sinclair for a starting place in the absence of &lt;a href=\"Nicky%20Ajose\"&gt;Nicky Ajose&lt;/a&gt; (loaned out) and Lee Tomlin (injured). Ball made just five substitute appearances however, and returned to Rochdale on loan on 24 November. His second loan spell at Rochdale was not as successful as his first spell as he failed to find the net in seven games and manager &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Eyre\"&gt;Steve Eyre&lt;/a&gt; was sacked. He was put on the transfer-list at Peterborough in April 2012.\nFleetwood Town.\nOn 23 July 2012, Ball signed for newly-promoted &lt;a href=\"EFL%20League%20Two\"&gt;League Two&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Fleetwood%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Fleetwood Town&lt;/a&gt; on a three-year deal.

He ended the campaign with nine goals in 38 games, before scoring 13 goals from 40 appearances in the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Fleetwood%20Town%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2013\u201314&lt;/a&gt; season. Fleetwood won promotion out of League Two with a 1\u20130 victory over &lt;a href=\"Burton%20Albion%20F.C.\"&gt;Burton Albion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Football%20League%20Two%20play-off%20Final\"&gt;2014 play-off final&lt;/a&gt;.

He scored eight goals in 30 League One games for the \"Fishermen\" during the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Fleetwood%20Town%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;2014\u201315&lt;/a&gt; campaign.\nIn August 2015, Ball signed a new two-year contract with Fleetwood.
