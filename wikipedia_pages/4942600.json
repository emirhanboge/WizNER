    "text": "Greater Noida is a &lt;a href=\"Planned%20community\"&gt;planned city&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Gautam%20Budh%20Nagar%20district\"&gt;Gautam Budh Nagar district&lt;/a&gt; of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The city was created as an extension to &lt;a href=\"Noida\"&gt;Noida area&lt;/a&gt; under the \"UP Industrial Area Development Act, 1976\". Situated south-east of the capital city of &lt;a href=\"New%20Delhi\"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, it takes around 30 minutes to travel between the cities via the &lt;a href=\"Noida-Greater%20Noida%20Expressway\"&gt;Noida-Greater Noida Expressway&lt;/a&gt;. The city is administered by Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA).\nHistory.\nIn the early 1980s, the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20India\"&gt;Government of India&lt;/a&gt; realised that the rapid rate at which Delhi was expanding would result in chaos. Hence, they planned to develop residential and industrial areas around the capital to reduce the demographic burden. Before Greater Noida City, two areas had been developed\u2014&lt;a href=\"Gurgaon\"&gt;Gurgaon&lt;/a&gt;, across the border from &lt;a href=\"Haryana\"&gt;Haryana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Noida\"&gt;Noida&lt;/a&gt;, across the border with Uttar Pradesh. \nGreater Noida Notified Area \u2013 38000 Ha (380\u00a0km2) comprising 124 villages. Noida's infrastructure was carefully laid out, but the 1990s saw huge growth in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20economy\"&gt;Indian economy&lt;/a&gt;. Migration to cities like Delhi, &lt;a href=\"Mumbai\"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;, Kolkata, &lt;a href=\"Chennai\"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt;, Hyderabad and Bangalore exceeded planning estimates. Noida was developed to accommodate population growth for 20\u201325 years. The massive population influx from &lt;a href=\"Delhi\"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, however, caused it to overload in a mere 15 years, although &lt;a href=\"infill\"&gt;intake&lt;/a&gt; is not complete and &lt;a href=\"illegal%20mining\"&gt;illegal mining&lt;/a&gt; remains a problem.\nThe &lt;a href=\"government%20of%20Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;government of Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; decided to develop another city as an extension to Noida with better &lt;a href=\"Urban%20planning\"&gt;planning&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was to create a world-class town approximately 25\u00a0 km from Noida. A railway station near &lt;a href=\"Boraki%20Railway%20Station\"&gt;Boraki&lt;/a&gt; and an international airport were included later in the plan intending to develop Greater Noida as an independent city.\nDuring the 1990s, the Noida extension (now a part of &lt;a href=\"Gautam%20Buddh%20Nagar\"&gt;Gautam Buddh Nagar&lt;/a&gt;) became what is today known as Greater Noida. The Greater NOIDA Authority manages the development of the city. Greater Noida is connected to &lt;a href=\"Agra\"&gt;Agra&lt;/a&gt; by the six-lane &lt;a href=\"Yamuna%20Expressway\"&gt;Yamuna Expressway&lt;/a&gt;. The annual &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Indian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; is held at the &lt;a href=\"Buddh%20International%20Circuit\"&gt;Buddh International Circuit&lt;/a&gt;. Roads are wide with service lanes for every major road. The sectors are named by letters of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20alphabet\"&gt;Greek alphabet&lt;/a&gt;. All cabling and utilities have been built underground. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are the oldest sectors. The other emerging sectors include Xu, Delta, Mu, Omicron and Tau. The present GNIDA office is in Gamma\u00a0 II sector just opposite the historical village Rampur Jagir/Jahangir where the revolutionary &lt;a href=\"Pandit%20Ram%20Prasad%20Bismil\"&gt;Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil&lt;/a&gt; lived in 1919 when he was hidden underground after the &lt;a href=\"Mainpuri\"&gt;Mainpuri&lt;/a&gt; conspiracy. A park has been named \"Amar Shaheed Pt. Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan\" by the Uttar Pradesh Government.\nThe 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Expo\"&gt;Auto Expo&lt;/a&gt;s (The Motor Show) were held at India Expo Mart, Greater Noida, in February 2014, 2016 and 2018, 2020 respectively. In 2018, Gamma 2 was officially declared as the capital of Greater Noida.\nGreater Noida (West).\nGreater Noida West, previously known as Noida extension, is a part of Greater Noida and consists of 16 villages: Khairpur Gurjar, Shahberi, &lt;a href=\"Devla\"&gt;Devla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patwari\"&gt;Patwari&lt;/a&gt;, Ghanghola, &lt;a href=\"Bisrakh\"&gt;Bisrakh&lt;/a&gt;, Roza-Yakubpur, &lt;a href=\"Haibatpur\"&gt;Haibatpur&lt;/a&gt;, Itaida, Patwari, Aminabad, Asadallapur, &lt;a href=\"Maincha\"&gt;Maincha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chipyana%20Buzurg\"&gt;Chipyana Buzurg&lt;/a&gt;. All sectors under Noida Extension (Sector 1 to 4) are a part of the Greater Noida Authority and share a separate pin code 201318.\nAs of late 2012, plans were being formed to rename it to Greater Noida (West). Planners intended the area to provide &lt;a href=\"National%20Capital%20Region%20%28India%29\"&gt;NCR&lt;/a&gt; region housing.\nDemographics.\nAs per the provisional data of the 2011 census, Greater Noida had a population of 107,676, with 58,662 males and 49,014 females. The literacy rate was 86.54%, 91.48% of males and 80.65% of females.\nAdministration.\nAuthority.\nThe city's infrastructure is looked after by the Greater NOIDA Authority, a statutory authority set-up under \"Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development Act, 1976\". Authority's head is its chairman, who is an &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Administrative%20Service\"&gt;IAS&lt;/a&gt; officer, the authority's daily matters however, are looked after by its CEO, who is also an &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Administrative%20Service\"&gt;IAS&lt;/a&gt; officer. Greater NOIDA Authority comes under the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Infrastructure%20and%20Industrial%20Development%20%28Uttar%20Pradesh%29\"&gt;Infrastructure and Industrial Development Department&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;Uttar Pradesh Government&lt;/a&gt;.
