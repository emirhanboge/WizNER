    "text": "The AMT Lightning pistol is a &lt;a href=\"semi-automatic%20pistol\"&gt;semi-automatic pistol&lt;/a&gt; chambered for &lt;a href=\".22%20Long%20Rifle\"&gt;.22 Long Rifle&lt;/a&gt; which was manufactured by &lt;a href=\"Arcadia%20Machine%20%26amp%3B%20Tool\"&gt;Arcadia Machine &amp; Tool&lt;/a&gt; (AMT) of &lt;a href=\"Covina%2C%20California\"&gt;Covina, California&lt;/a&gt; during the 1980s and early 1990s.\nThe pistol was an unlicensed, stainless steel clone of the &lt;a href=\"Ruger%20Mark%20II\"&gt;Ruger Mark II&lt;/a&gt; pistol, that was updated from the Ruger, by the addition of target sights, target trigger, and Pachmayr target grips as standard items. The Lightning had the receiver grooved for &lt;a href=\"scope%20mount\"&gt;scope mount&lt;/a&gt;ing and the trigger guard was designed to allow a two hand hold. At the time of the Lightning pistol's introduction, stainless steel Ruger Mk series pistols were rare. The Lightning pistol, along with the &lt;a href=\"AMT%20Lightning%2025/22\"&gt;AMT Lightning 25/22&lt;/a&gt; rifle, prompted a successful &lt;a href=\"trademark%20infringement\"&gt;trademark infringement&lt;/a&gt; lawsuit by &lt;a href=\"Ruger\"&gt;Ruger&lt;/a&gt; that forced AMT to discontinue the model line."
