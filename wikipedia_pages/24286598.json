Designed as a &lt;a href=\"submarine%20aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;submarine aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;, she was commissioned in March 1945. She surrendered in August 1945 and was sunk as a target in 1946.\nDesign and description.\nPrevious &lt;a href=\"Type%20A%20submarine\"&gt;Type A submarine&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 both &lt;a href=\"Type%20A1%20submarine\"&gt;Type A1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Type%20A2%20submarine\"&gt;Type A2&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 were &lt;a href=\"submarine%20aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;submarine aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;s capable of carrying a single reconnaissance &lt;a href=\"floatplane\"&gt;floatplane&lt;/a&gt; and fitted with command facilities so that they could serve as &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt;s for embarked &lt;a href=\"admiral\"&gt;admiral&lt;/a&gt;s and their staffs. The Type AM submarines were versions of the preceding Type A2, but with the command facilities replaced by an enlarged aircraft &lt;a href=\"hangar\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt; fitted for a pair of &lt;a href=\"Aichi%20M6A\"&gt;Aichi M6A1&lt;/a&gt; \"Seiran\" (\"Clear Sky Storm\") floatplane &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt;s. They &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long &lt;a href=\"Length%20overall\"&gt;overall&lt;/a&gt; and had a &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and a &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . They had a diving depth of .\nFor surface running, the submarines were powered by two &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s, each driving one &lt;a href=\"propeller%20shaft\"&gt;propeller shaft&lt;/a&gt;. When the submarines were submerged, each propeller was driven by a &lt;a href=\"electric%20motor\"&gt;electric motor&lt;/a&gt;. They could reach on the surface and submerged. On the surface, the Type AMs had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at .\nThe Type AM submarines were armed with six internal &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s and carried a dozen &lt;a href=\"Type%2095%20torpedo\"&gt;Type 95&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es. They were also armed with a single &lt;a href=\"14%20cm/40%2011th%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun\"&gt;/40&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"deck%20gun\"&gt;deck gun&lt;/a&gt; and two triple and one single &lt;a href=\"Gun%20mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun\"&gt;Type 96&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"anti-aircraft%20gun\"&gt;anti-aircraft gun&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe aircraft &lt;a href=\"hangar\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt; was enlarged from that of the Type A2 to accommodate two aircraft. It was offset to the right of, and was faired into the base of, the &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt;, which protruded over the left side of the &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28ship%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt;. A single &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20catapult\"&gt;aircraft catapult&lt;/a&gt; was positioned on the forward deck. Two folding &lt;a href=\"Crane%20%28machine%29\"&gt;cranes&lt;/a&gt; on the forward deck were used to recover the floatplanes.\nConstruction and commissioning.\nBuilt by &lt;a href=\"Kawasaki%20Shipbuilding%20Corporation\"&gt;Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kobe\"&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, \"I-14\" was &lt;a href=\"Keel-laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; as Submarine No. 50911, the second Type AM submarine and last one to be completed, on 18 May 1943. She was renamed I-14 by the time she was &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 14 March 1944. She was completed and &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 14 March 1945.\nService history.\nMarch\u2013June 1945.\nOn the day of her commissioning, \"I-14\" was attached to the &lt;a href=\"Yokosuka%20Naval%20District\"&gt;Yokosuka Naval District&lt;/a&gt; and assigned to Submarine &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28naval%29\"&gt;Division&lt;/a&gt; 1 in the &lt;a href=\"6th%20Fleet%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29\"&gt;6th Fleet&lt;/a&gt; along with the submarines (, , and ). She departed Kobe that day for &lt;a href=\"Kure\"&gt;Kure&lt;/a&gt;, Japan, which she reached on 15 March 1945. She was at Kure when the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;\u2032s &lt;a href=\"Task%20Force%2058\"&gt;Task Force 58&lt;/a&gt; launched &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Kure%20%28March%201945%29\"&gt;the first carrier aircraft strike&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Kure%20Naval%20Arsenal\"&gt;Kure Naval Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; on 19 March 1945. Although 240 planes from the &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;s , , , , , , and attacked Kure, she escaped damage.\nDuring March 1945, after the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces\"&gt;United States Army Air Forces&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Twentieth%20Air%20Force\"&gt;Twentieth Air Force&lt;/a&gt; conducted a major &lt;a href=\"Bombing%20of%20Tokyo%20%2810%20March%201945%29\"&gt;fire-bombing raid&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; on the night of 9-10 March 1945, the 6th Fleet proposed to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20General%20Staff\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff&lt;/a&gt; a retaliatory raid on &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=\"Aichi%20M6A\"&gt;Aichi M6A&lt;/a&gt;1 \"Seiran\" floatplanes launched by the submarines of Submarine Division 1, but by April 1945 the General Staff's vice chief, &lt;a href=\"Vice%20admiral\"&gt;Vice Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jisabur%C5%8D%20Ozawa\"&gt;Jisabur\u014d Ozawa&lt;/a&gt;, had rejected the proposal.\nBy late May 1945, \"I-14\" and the other three submarines of Submarine Division 1 all had been fitted with &lt;a href=\"submarine%20snorkel\"&gt;submarine snorkel&lt;/a&gt;s. At 08:00 on 27 May 1945, \"I-13\" and \"I-14\" departed Kure and made for &lt;a href=\"Moji-ku%2C%20Kitaky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB\"&gt;Moji&lt;/a&gt; on the coast of &lt;a href=\"Kyushu\"&gt;Kyushu&lt;/a&gt;, where they dropped anchor at 19:00 and spent the night. They got back underway on 28 May, passed through the &lt;a href=\"Shimonoseki%20Strait\"&gt;Shimonoseki Strait&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tsushima%20Strait\"&gt;Tsushima Strait&lt;/a&gt; and crossed the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Sea of Japan&lt;/a&gt;, arriving the same day at &lt;a href=\"Chinkai%20Guard%20District\"&gt;Chinkai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Korea%20under%20Japanese%20rule\"&gt;Ch\u014dsen&lt;/a&gt; (the Japanese name for &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt; while under their rule) to refuel. They departed Chinkai on 29 May to return to Japan, stopping at &lt;a href=\"Toyama%20Bay\"&gt;Toyama Bay&lt;/a&gt; on the coast of &lt;a href=\"Honshu\"&gt;Honshu&lt;/a&gt; on 1 June 1945 because of dense &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt;. \"I-14\" arrived at &lt;a href=\"Nanao%20Bay\"&gt;Nanao Bay&lt;/a&gt; on the western coast of &lt;a href=\"Honshu\"&gt;Honshu&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Takaoka%2C%20Toyama\"&gt;Takaoka&lt;/a&gt;, Japan, on 2 June 1945.\nPanama Canal operation.\n\"I-13\", \"I-400\", and \"I-401\" soon rendezvoused with \"I-14\" in Nanao Bay, and the submarines were joined by six &lt;a href=\"Aichi%20M6A\"&gt;Aichi M6A&lt;/a&gt;1 \"Seiran\" (\"Clear Sky Storm\") aircraft of the Kure-based 631st Naval Air Group, which flew in on 4 June after a stop at &lt;a href=\"Fukuyama%2C%20Hiroshima\"&gt;Fukuyama&lt;/a&gt;, Japan. On 6 June 1945, the submarines and aircraft began training for night air operations in preparation for a surprise Japanese air strike against the &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal\"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt; in which the submarines would launch ten M6A1 &lt;a href=\"floatplane\"&gt;floatplane&lt;/a&gt;s which were to strike the &lt;a href=\"Gatun%20Locks\"&gt;Gatun Locks&lt;/a&gt; from the east with six &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es and four &lt;a href=\"Aerial%20bomb\"&gt;bombs&lt;/a&gt;, emptying &lt;a href=\"Gatun%20Lake\"&gt;Gatun Lake&lt;/a&gt; and blocking the &lt;a href=\"canal\"&gt;canal&lt;/a&gt; to shipping for months. During training, the Japanese demonstrated that four trained men could prepare one of the floatplanes for launch from a submarine in seven minutes and that each submarine could assemble, fuel, arm, and launch all three of the floatplanes it carried in 45 minutes. Despite various obstacles\u2014the presence of American &lt;a href=\"Naval%20mines\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. Navy submarines and shortages of &lt;a href=\"aviation%20gasoline\"&gt;aviation gasoline&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the submarines and aircraft launched a number of simulated air strikes.\nWhile Submarine Division 1 was still at Nanao Bay, the expected imminent fall of &lt;a href=\"Okinawa\"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt; to U.S. forces as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Okinawa\"&gt;Battle of Okinawa&lt;/a&gt; neared its conclusion and the increasing pace of air strikes by &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; aircraft carriers on the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20archipelago\"&gt;Japanese Home Islands&lt;/a&gt; prompted Japanese &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20General%20Headquarters\"&gt;Imperial General Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; to cancel the Panama Canal strike on 12 June 1945 and decide instead to use the submarines and their floatplanes to strike the Allied fleet anchorage at &lt;a href=\"Ulithi\"&gt;Ulithi&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20Islands\"&gt;Caroline Islands&lt;/a&gt;. The submarines and aircraft completed their flight training on 19 June 1945, with all of the M6A1 floatplanes taking off from the waters of Nanao Bay that day. One failed to return, and the bodies of its two crewmen later washed ashore on &lt;a href=\"Sadogashima\"&gt;Sadogashima&lt;/a&gt;. On 20 June 1945, \"I-14\" got underway for &lt;a href=\"Maizuru\"&gt;Maizuru&lt;/a&gt;, Japan, in company with \"I-13\". They reached Maizuru on 22 June 1945, where \"I-14\" underwent repairs to her &lt;a href=\"propeller\"&gt;propeller&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bearing%20%28mechanical%29\"&gt;bearings&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation \"Hikari\".\nAt 13:25 on 25 June 1945, the &lt;a href=\"Combined%20Fleet\"&gt;Combined Fleet&lt;/a&gt; issued orders for the attack on Ulithi, dubbed &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Arashi\"&gt;Operation \"Arashi\"&lt;/a&gt; (\"Mountain Storm\"). The orders called for \"I-13\" and \"I-14\" to transport disassembled &lt;a href=\"Nakajima%20C6N\"&gt;Nakajima C6N&lt;/a&gt;1 \"Saiun\" (&lt;a href=\"Cloud%20iridescence\"&gt;Iridiscent Cloud&lt;/a&gt;\"; &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II%20Allied%20names%20for%20Japanese%20aircraft\"&gt;Allied reporting name&lt;/a&gt; \"Myrt\") &lt;a href=\"reconnaissance%20aircraft\"&gt;reconnaissance aircraft&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Chuuk%20Lagoon\"&gt;Truk Atoll&lt;/a&gt; in the Caroline Islands in late July 1945. The C6N aircraft were to be reassembled at Truk and then, in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Hikari\"&gt;Operation \"Hikari\"&lt;/a&gt; (\"Shining Light\"), conduct a reconnaissance of Ulithi, noting the presence and location of Allied aircraft carriers and &lt;a href=\"troop%20transport\"&gt;troop transport&lt;/a&gt;s. \"I-400\" and \"I-401\" then were to launch a combined total of six M6A1 floatplanes\u2014which were to use the reconnaissance information to assist them in targeting Allied ships\u2014on 17 August 1945 for a nighttime strike under a full moon against the Ulithi anchorage, each pilot receiving a &lt;a href=\"hormone\"&gt;hormone&lt;/a&gt; injection to improve his &lt;a href=\"night%20vision\"&gt;night vision&lt;/a&gt; and each plane armed with an bomb. After the strike, the aircraft were to land near the submarines, and \"I-13\", \"I-14\", \"I-400\", and \"I-401\" all were to proceed to &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, where ten new M6A aircraft would await them for embarkation for another strike.\nOn 2 July 1945, \"I-14\" departed Maizuru in company with \"I-13\" and set course for &lt;a href=\"%C5%8Cminato%20Guard%20District\"&gt;\u014cminato&lt;/a&gt; on the northern tip of Honshu, where plans called for them to load crated C6N aircraft and proceed to Truk. \"I-13\" reached \u014cminato on 4 July, but the problem with \"I-14\"\u2032s propeller bearings worsened during the voyage, and she did not arrive until 6 July 1945. She entered &lt;a href=\"drydock\"&gt;drydock&lt;/a&gt; at \u014cminato for further repairs, and her crew was granted &lt;a href=\"shore%20leave\"&gt;shore leave&lt;/a&gt;. By 9 July, Japanese repair crews estimated that \"I-14\"\u2032s repairs would require as many as ten more days, so \"I-13\" departed without her with two crated C6Ns aboard on 11 July 1945 bound for Truk; the Japanese never heard from \"I-13\" again, and she was sunk on 16 July during her voyage to Truk.\nWhile \"I-14\" was under repair, U.S. Navy carrier aircraft attacked \u014cminato, but she submerged and avoided damage. With her repairs finally complete, she departed \u014cminato bound for Truk with two crated C6N aircraft aboard on 17 July 1945. On the day of her departure, &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Radio%20Unit%2C%20Melbourne\"&gt;Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne (FRUMEL)&lt;/a&gt;, an Allied &lt;a href=\"signals%20intelligence\"&gt;signals intelligence&lt;/a&gt; unit at &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, decrypted a message which informed the Allies that \"I-14\" would depart \u014cminato at 15:00 that day bound for Truk and expected to be &lt;a href=\"Bearing%20%28angle%29\"&gt;bearing&lt;/a&gt; 106 degrees from &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Shiriya\"&gt;Cape Shiriya&lt;/a&gt; at 03:00 on 19 July, at which point she planned to alter course to 110 degrees.\nDespite this Allied knowledge of the plans for her voyage, \"I-14\" avoided contact with Allied forces until 30 July 1945, when Allied surface ships detected her in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; east of the &lt;a href=\"Mariana%20Islands\"&gt;Mariana Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Several &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s began tracking her, forcing her to remain submerged for 35 hours. After her &lt;a href=\"Electric%20battery\"&gt;batteries&lt;/a&gt; and supply of &lt;a href=\"compressed%20air\"&gt;compressed air&lt;/a&gt; both became depleted, she succeeding in raising her snorkel and recharging her batteries without being seen, and she managed to break contact. At 03:30 &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Standard%20Time\"&gt;Japan Standard Time&lt;/a&gt; (JST) on 3 August 1945, she detected propeller noises from multiple vessels northeast of Truk, and shortly afterward she sighted a group of what she identified as U.S. Navy &lt;a href=\"submarine%20chaser\"&gt;submarine chaser&lt;/a&gt;s. She reversed course and evaded them. She arrived at Truk at 17:30 JST on 4 August 1945 and unloaded the two C6N aircraft for reassembly ashore. Ordered to return to Japan after unloading the aircraft, \"I-14\" received new orders on 6 August 1945 to proceed to Singapore instead.\n\"I-14\" had not yet left Truk when &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hirohito\"&gt;Hirohito&lt;/a&gt; announced on 15 August 1945 that hostilities between Japan and the Allies would end that day. At 21:00 on 18 August 1945, Submarine Division 1\u2032s commander, Captain Ariizumi, at sea aboard \"I-401\" to conduct the Ulithi attack, received orders from the 6th Fleet to cancel it, and later that day the 6th Fleet ordered \"I-14\", \"I-400\", and \"I-401\" to jettison all aircraft, &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es, other munitions, and documents, hoist the designated black flag of surrender, and proceed on the surface first to &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; and then to Japan. \"I-14\"\u2032s &lt;a href=\"commanding%20officer\"&gt;commanding officer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Commander\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; Tsuruzo Shimizu, briefly considered proceeding to Singapore rather than Japan after stopping at Hong Kong in the hope of continuing the war, but gave up on the idea because \"I-14\" lacked the fuel for a voyage to Singapore.\nEnd of war.\n\"I-14\" departed Truk on 18 August 1945. She was on the surface in the Pacific Ocean east of Honshu at flying the black surrender flag on 27 August 1945 when a plane from U.S. Navy &lt;a href=\"Task%20Force%2038\"&gt;Task Force 38&lt;/a&gt; sighted her and reported her position. Later in the day, she surrendered to the U.S. Navy destroyers and northeast of Tokyo. A boarding party from \"Murray\" went aboard \"I-14\" and accepted the &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s of \"I-14\"\u2032s &lt;a href=\"Commissioned%20officer\"&gt;officers&lt;/a&gt;. \"Murray\" then began to escort \"I-14\" toward &lt;a href=\"Sagami%20Bay\"&gt;Sagami Bay&lt;/a&gt; on the coast of Honshu. On 28 August 1945, the U.S. Navy &lt;a href=\"destroyer%20escort\"&gt;destroyer escort&lt;/a&gt; rendezvoused with them east of &lt;a href=\"Nojimazaki%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Nojimazaki&lt;/a&gt; and sent a &lt;a href=\"prize%20crew\"&gt;prize crew&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. Navy personnel aboard \"I-14\" to take command of her in exchange for forty \"I-14\" personnel, who became &lt;a href=\"Prisoner-of-war\"&gt;prisoners-of-war&lt;/a&gt; aboard \"Bangust\". \"Bangust\" relieved \"Murray\" of escort duty and began to escort \"I-14\" toward Sagami Bay. They arrived at Sagami Bay on 29 August 1945, and at 09:55 \"I-14\" moored there alongside the U.S. Navy &lt;a href=\"submarine%20tender\"&gt;submarine tender&lt;/a&gt; outboard of \"I-400\", which had already surrendered and tied up alongside \"Proteus\" under the command of a prize crew.\nAt 08:20 on 30 August 1945, \"I-14\" got underway in company with \"I-400\" and \"Proteus\" bound for &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Bay\"&gt;Tokyo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, where they &lt;a href=\"anchor\"&gt;anchor&lt;/a&gt;ed at 14:58 the same day. At 14:45 \"I-400\", \"I-14\", and \"Proteus\" began a move to a new anchorage within the &lt;a href=\"Breakwater%20%28structure%29\"&gt;breakwater&lt;/a&gt; at the submarine base at &lt;a href=\"Yokosuka\"&gt;Yokosuka&lt;/a&gt;, Japan, where \"Proteus\" was anchored by 16:50. Twelve U.S. Navy submarines chosen to represent the U.S. Navy Submarine Force at the &lt;a href=\"Surrender%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Japanese surrender ceremony&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Bay\"&gt;Tokyo Bay&lt;/a&gt; also were anchored there, and the surrendered \"I-401\" arrived on 31 August as well. The surrender ceremony took place aboard the U.S. Navy &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt; in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945.\nPostwar.\nThe Japanese removed \"I-14\" from the navy list on 15 September 1945. \"I-14\" departed Yokosuka on 1 November 1945 bound for &lt;a href=\"Sasebo\"&gt;Sasebo&lt;/a&gt;, Japan, in company with \"I-400\" and \"I-401\", also operated by U.S. Navy crews, and escorted by the &lt;a href=\"submarine%20rescue%20vessel\"&gt;submarine rescue vessel&lt;/a&gt; . They arrived at Sasebo the same day.\nAfter loading Japanese &lt;a href=\"Motor%20vessel\"&gt;motor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Launch%20%28boat%29\"&gt;launches&lt;/a&gt; onto their decks to serve as &lt;a href=\"Lifeboat%20%28shipboard%29\"&gt;lifeboats&lt;/a&gt;, \"I-14\", \"I-400\", and \"I-401\" departed Sasebo on 11 December 1945 bound for &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, under escort by \"Greenlet\" and manned by U.S. Navy crews, with \"I-14\" under the command of &lt;a href=\"Commander%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20S.%20McCain%20Jr.\"&gt;John S. McCain Jr.&lt;/a&gt; A few days after departure, the vessels weathered a powerful storm, during which \"I-14\"\u2032s crew noted that her &lt;a href=\"hangar\"&gt;hangar&lt;/a&gt;, offset to &lt;a href=\"Port%20and%20starboard\"&gt;starboard&lt;/a&gt;, threw her off balance in heavy seas and created rough riding for the men aboard her. The vessels stopped along the way at &lt;a href=\"Apra%20Harbor\"&gt;Apra Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt; in the Mariana Islands from 18 to 21 December 1945, then at &lt;a href=\"Eniwetok\"&gt;Eniwetok&lt;/a&gt; in the Marshall Islands, and then at &lt;a href=\"Kwajalein\"&gt;Kwajalein&lt;/a&gt; for food and supplies from 26 to 27 December 1945. On the final leg of the voyage from Kwajalein Atoll, \"I-14\"\u2032s crew experienced the curiosity of celebrating &lt;a href=\"New%20Year%27s%20Eve\"&gt;New Year's Eve&lt;/a&gt; twice, once on 31 December 1945 west of the International Date Line, then again the following day east of the line, and took advantage of the opportunity to celebrate on both occasions. The three submarines and \"Greenlet\" arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 January 1946 and tied up at the Submarine Base, where a U.S. Navy band and local celebrities welcomed them.\nDisposal.\nWith postwar relations with the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; deteriorating rapidly and concerns growing in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; that under postwar agreements the Soviets would demand access to the captured Japanese submarines that would provide the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Navy\"&gt;Soviet Navy&lt;/a&gt; with valuable information about advanced Japanese submarine designs, the U.S. Navy issued orders on 26 March 1946 to sink all captured Japanese submarines. Accordingly, the U.S. Navy submarine sank \"I-14\" as a target in tests of the Mark 10 Mod 3 exploder off Pearl Harbor at on 28 May 1946.\nDiscovery of wreck.\nOn 15 February 2009, the &lt;a href=\"Hawaii%20Undersea%20Research%20Laboratory\"&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;'s (HURL) deep-diving submersibles \"&lt;a href=\"Pisces%20IV\"&gt;Pisces IV&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Pisces%20V\"&gt;Pisces V&lt;/a&gt;\",\nworking with a group from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration\"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt;, located \"I-14\"\u2032s &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; section off &lt;a href=\"Kalaeloa%2C%20Hawaii\"&gt;Barber's Point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oahu\"&gt;Oahu&lt;/a&gt;. Later the same day they found the rest of her wreck, determining that the entire wreck lay at a depth of .\nOn 17 February 2009, the two submersibles conducted extensive surveys of the wrecks of \"I-14\" and the Japanese submarine , also lying in two pieces in the area after the U.S. Navy sank her as a target in 1946. The survey found that \"I-14\" had broken in two atthe forward end of her hangar bay, and that the hangar door was missing, but the hangar itself remained attached to the &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28ship%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt;. The hangar's after portion had heavy damage, but aft of the hangar bay the wreck was in \"pristine\" condition. The &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt; was intact, and \"I-14\" remained clearly visible, painted on both sides of it. The forward &lt;a href=\"Type%2096%2025%20mm%20AT/AA%20Gun\"&gt;Type 96&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"antiaircraft%20gun\"&gt;antiaircraft gun&lt;/a&gt;s had corroded and were aimed nearly vertically in their triple &lt;a href=\"Gun%20mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;. The bow section rested to starboard of the hull and had a mangled end but otherwise was in good condition. A debris field littered with batteries lay on the &lt;a href=\"seabed\"&gt;seabed&lt;/a&gt; in between the bow section and the hull. A &lt;a href=\"WildLife%20Productions\"&gt;WildLife Productions&lt;/a&gt; film crew was aboard each submersible to record footage during the survey for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Geographic%20Channel\"&gt;National Geographic Channel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"documentary%20film\"&gt;documentary film&lt;/a&gt; \"Hunt for the Samurai Subs\".\nResearchers announced the discovery of the wrecks of \"I-14\" and \"I-201\" on 12 November 2009. The search for the wrecks and video footage of them on the ocean bottom was featured in \"Hunt for the Samurai Subs\", which premiered in the United States on the National Geographic Channel on 17 November 2009."
