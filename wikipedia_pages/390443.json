The &lt;a href=\"Gord%20%28archaeology%29\"&gt;gord&lt;/a&gt; of Bielsk was probably founded by Ruthenian dukes, and its existence was first mentioned in 1253, in the so-called &lt;a href=\"Hypatian%20Codex\"&gt;Hypatian Codex&lt;/a&gt;. In 1273, Bielsk was captured by Lithuanian duke &lt;a href=\"Traidenis\"&gt;Traidenis&lt;/a&gt;, and in the early 14th century, whole province of &lt;a href=\"Podlasie\"&gt;Podlasie&lt;/a&gt; became annexed by the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;. The region was subject to &lt;a href=\"Teutonic%20Knights\"&gt;Teutonic Knights&lt;/a&gt; raids, which took place in 1346 and 1379.\nIn 1382, &lt;a href=\"Mazovia\"&gt;Mazovia&lt;/a&gt;n Duke &lt;a href=\"Janusz%20I%20of%20Warsaw\"&gt;Janusz I of Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; captured Bielsk, &lt;a href=\"Drohiczyn\"&gt;Drohiczyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sura%C5%BC\"&gt;Sura\u017c&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mielnik\"&gt;Mielnik&lt;/a&gt;, taking advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Lithuanian%20Civil%20War%20%281381%E2%80%9384%29\"&gt;Lithuanian Civil War (1381\u201384)&lt;/a&gt;. Next year, &lt;a href=\"Jogaila\"&gt;Jogaila&lt;/a&gt; pushed the Mazovians out of Bielsko, handing the gord over to &lt;a href=\"Vytautas\"&gt;Vytautas&lt;/a&gt; (Witold). In 1390, &lt;a href=\"Jogaila\"&gt;Jogaila&lt;/a&gt;, who had become King of Poland as W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o, handed Bielsk, Sura\u017c, Drohiczyn and Mielnik over to Janusz I.\nDue to its convenient location along a merchant route from &lt;a href=\"Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Vilnius\"&gt;Vilnius&lt;/a&gt;, Bielsk became an important center of trade and administration. In late November 1412, it was visited by King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o, and 1413, the &lt;a href=\"ziemia\"&gt;Land&lt;/a&gt; of Drohiczyn, together with Bielsk, became part of &lt;a href=\"Trakai%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Trakai Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt;. In 1430, Duke Vytautas named first &lt;a href=\"vogt\"&gt;vogt&lt;/a&gt; of Bielsko, a man named Andrzej. A number of Poles from Mazovia begin to settle in Podlasie.\nBielsk received its &lt;a href=\"Magdeburg%20rights\"&gt;Magdeburg rights&lt;/a&gt; town charter on 18 November 1495, from King &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20I%20Jagiellon\"&gt;Alexander I Jagiellon&lt;/a&gt;. In September 1501, a meeting of Lithuanian &lt;a href=\"szlachta\"&gt;nobility&lt;/a&gt; took place here. Several Polish rulers visited Bielsk, such as W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o, Alexander I (1505), &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%20I%20the%20Old\"&gt;Sigismund I the Old&lt;/a&gt; (1506, 1509), and &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%20II%20Augustus\"&gt;Sigismund II Augustus&lt;/a&gt; (1564). In 1513, Bielsk was named capital of the newly created &lt;a href=\"Podlaskie%20Voivodeship%20%281513%E2%80%931795%29\"&gt;Podlaskie Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt;; by 1563, the town had 830 houses, and was also main center of the &lt;a href=\"ziemia\"&gt;Land of Bielsko&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn early summer of 1564, when king Sigismund II Augustus stayed here with Primate &lt;a href=\"Jakub%20Ucha%C5%84ski\"&gt;Jakub Ucha\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, to discuss the new Polish \u2013 Lithuanian union (see &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Lublin\"&gt;Union of Lublin&lt;/a&gt;), the wooden castle of Bielsk burned to the ground, with the king watching the incident from the stables. A new castle for the local &lt;a href=\"starosta\"&gt;starosta&lt;/a&gt; was built in Ho\u0142owiesko (located within present-day town limits of Bielsk), while the land court was moved to &lt;a href=\"Bra%C5%84sk\"&gt;Bra\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Lublin\"&gt;Union of Lublin&lt;/a&gt; (1569), Bielsko was transferred from Grand Duchy of Lithuania into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Kingdom of Poland&lt;/a&gt;. Bielsk was a &lt;a href=\"royal%20city%20in%20Poland\"&gt;royal town of Poland&lt;/a&gt;, administratively located in the &lt;a href=\"Podlaskie%20Voivodeship%20%281513%E2%80%931795%29\"&gt;Podlaskie Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Poland%20Province%20of%20the%20Polish%20Crown\"&gt;Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown&lt;/a&gt;. The town prospered, with churches, hospital, mills, shops and 265 artisans (as for 1576). Bielsko burned in 1591, and &lt;a href=\"Deluge%20%28history%29\"&gt;Swedish invasion of Poland&lt;/a&gt; brought almost complete destruction (1655).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Carmelites\"&gt;Carmelites&lt;/a&gt; Church in Bielsk and monastery was founded in 1641 by magnate &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Kazanowski\"&gt;Adam Kazanowski&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"starost\"&gt;starost&lt;/a&gt; of Bielsk from 1638) and dedicated to the Mother of God of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Carmel\"&gt;Mount Carmel&lt;/a&gt;. The project was also financed by his wife El\u017cbieta (\"Halszka\") S\u0142uszczanka (around 1619\u20131671).\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Partition%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Third Partition of Poland&lt;/a&gt;, Bielsk briefly belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Kingdom of Prussia&lt;/a&gt; (1795\u20131807): after the &lt;a href=\"Treaties%20of%20Tilsit\"&gt;Treaties of Tilsit&lt;/a&gt;, it was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. From 1843, it belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Grodno%20Governorate\"&gt;Grodno Governorate&lt;/a&gt;. Residents of the area actively participated in the largest 19th-century Polish uprisings (&lt;a href=\"November%20Uprising\"&gt;November Uprising&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"January%20Uprising\"&gt;January Uprising&lt;/a&gt;). Bielsk was one of the sites of Russian executions of Polish insurgents during the January Uprising of 1863\u20131864. Additionally, in September 1863, as punishment for supporting the uprising, Russians plundered the nearby village of &lt;a href=\"%C5%81ukawica%2C%20Podlaskie%20Voivodeship\"&gt;\u0141ukawica&lt;/a&gt;, and expelled its entire population, which was forcibly marched to Bielsk, and then deported to &lt;a href=\"katorga\"&gt;katorga&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Siberia\"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;. Two people died during the march from \u0141ukawica to Bielsk: an old man and a child. As part of the post-uprising &lt;a href=\"Anti-Polish%20sentiment\"&gt;anti-Polish&lt;/a&gt; repressions, the town was subjected to &lt;a href=\"Russification%20of%20Poles%20during%20the%20Partitions\"&gt;Russification&lt;/a&gt;, the local Catholic church was closed down, and Polish clergy was also deported to Siberia. Edward Kiersnowski, leader of a local insurgent unit, who fought in several battles in the region, died while being deported to Siberia in 1864. In 1873, Bielsk received rail connection with &lt;a href=\"Brest%20Litovsk\"&gt;Brest Litovsk&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1915, during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, German troops burned the rail station. Germans retreated from the town in February 1919, and were replaced by Polish Army units. In late July 1920, during the &lt;a href=\"Polish-Soviet%20War\"&gt;Polish-Soviet War&lt;/a&gt;, Bielsk was briefly occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Polish%20Republic\"&gt;Second Polish Republic&lt;/a&gt;, Bielsk administratively belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Bialystok%20Voivodeship%20%281919%E2%80%9339%29\"&gt;Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 1939 joint German-Soviet &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Poland\"&gt;invasion of Poland&lt;/a&gt;, which started &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the town was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;Wehrmacht&lt;/a&gt;, which on 23 September handed it over to the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviets&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=\"Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;occupied&lt;/a&gt; it until 23 June 1941, forcibly sending thousands to &lt;a href=\"Siberia\"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1941\u20131944, the town was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Germans murdered its &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; minority, and in a nearby forest killed approximately 800 &lt;a href=\"Poles\"&gt;Poles&lt;/a&gt;. The Germans also operated a &lt;a href=\"Forced%20labour%20under%20German%20rule%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;forced labour&lt;/a&gt; camp in the town. Bielsk was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; on 30 July 1944. The Russians then carried out arrests of local &lt;a href=\"Polish%20resistance%20movement%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Polish resistance&lt;/a&gt; members, including 12 officers of the local command of the &lt;a href=\"Home%20Army\"&gt;Home Army&lt;/a&gt;, who were arrested on 4 August 1944 in nearby &lt;a href=\"Bra%C5%84sk\"&gt;Bra\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;, where they were deceitfully gathered for a supposed formal meeting with the command of the Soviet &lt;a href=\"North%20Western%20Operational%20Command\"&gt;65th Army&lt;/a&gt;.
