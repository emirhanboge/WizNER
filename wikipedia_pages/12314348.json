    "text": "Sanballat the Horonite () \u2013 or Sanballat I \u2013 was a &lt;a href=\"Samaritans\"&gt;Samaritan&lt;/a&gt; leader and official of the Persian &lt;a href=\"Achaemenid%20Empire\"&gt;Achaemenid Empire&lt;/a&gt; who lived in the mid to late 5th century BC and was a contemporary of &lt;a href=\"Nehemiah\"&gt;Nehemiah&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nIn Hebrew the name is \"Sanballat\" (). &lt;a href=\"Eberhard%20Schrader\"&gt;Eberhard Schrader&lt;/a&gt;, cited in &lt;a href=\"Brown%E2%80%93Driver%E2%80%93Briggs\"&gt;Brown\u2013Driver\u2013Briggs&lt;/a&gt;, considered that the name in &lt;a href=\"Akkadian%20language\"&gt;Akkadian&lt;/a&gt; was \"S\u012bnuballit\", from the name of &lt;a href=\"Sin%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;the Sumerian moon god S\u012bn&lt;/a&gt; meaning \"S\u012bn has begotten.\"\nThe name of the god S\u012bn in the context of Sanballat's name has since been mistakenly confused with the unrelated English noun &lt;a href=\"sin\"&gt;sin&lt;/a&gt; in some popular English commentaries on Nehemiah. Other earlier commentators had sometimes taken Sanballat as being a military rank rather than a name.\nBiblical account.\nSanballat.\nHe is best known from the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Nehemiah\"&gt;Book of Nehemiah&lt;/a&gt;, which casts him as one of the chief opponents of the &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;ish governor &lt;a href=\"Nehemiah\"&gt;Nehemiah&lt;/a&gt; during the latter's efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and carrying out his reforms among the Jews. In &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Nehemiah\"&gt;Jewish tradition&lt;/a&gt;, he was called \"the Horonite,\" (from \"Horon\", possibly identified with present-day &lt;a href=\"Huwara\"&gt;Huwara&lt;/a&gt;) and was associated with &lt;a href=\"Tobiah%20%28Ammonite%29\"&gt;Tobiah the Ammonite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geshem%20the%20Arabian\"&gt;Geshem the Arabian&lt;/a&gt;. His home was evidently in Samaria.\nAccording to Nehemiah, when he and his escort arrived in Jerusalem, their return aroused the enmity of Sanballat and his allies. They were aggrieved that the welfare of the Jews should be fostered. When Nehemiah actually disclosed his intention of building the walls of Jerusalem they laughed him to scorn, and said, \"Will ye rebel against the &lt;a href=\"shahanshah\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;?\" Nehemiah resented their insinuation, and told them that they had no right in Jerusalem, nor any interest in its affairs. As soon as Sanballat and his associates heard that Nehemiah and the Jews were actually building the walls, they were angry; and Sanballat addressed the army of Samaria with a contemptuous reference to \"these feeble Jews.\" Tobiah appeased him by saying that a fox (or a jackal) climbing on the wall they were building would break it down. Nehemiah and his builders, the Jews, vigorously hurried the work, while Sanballat and his associates organized their forces to fight against Jerusalem. Nehemiah prepared to meet the opposition and continued the work on the walls. Five different times Sanballat and his confederates challenged Nehemiah and the Jews to meet them for a parley in the plain of Ono. Nehemiah was equal to the emergency and attended strictly to his work. Then Sanballat, with Jews in Jerusalem who were his confederates, attempted to entrap Nehemiah in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;; but the scheme failed. Sanballat's Jewish allies, however, kept Sanballat and Tobiah informed as to the progress of the work in Jerusalem. With the hand of the Lord upon Nehemiah along with Nehemiah's far-sighted policy and his shrewdness, he was kept out of the hands of these neighbor-foes. In his reforms, so effectively carried out, he discovered that one of the grandsons of the current high priest &lt;a href=\"Eliashib%20%28High%20Priest%29\"&gt;Eliashib&lt;/a&gt; had married a daughter of this Sanballat, and was thus son-in-law of the chief enemy of the Jews. Nehemiah also found that Eliashib had leased the storerooms of the temple to Tobiah, thus depriving the Levites of their share of the offerings in Nehemiah's absence. The high priest (and/or possibly his son Jehoida and the unnamed grandson) was driven out of Jerusalem on the ground that he had defiled the priesthood ().\nZechariah.\nIt has been speculated that the business dealings of Sanballat with the descendants of &lt;a href=\"Joshua%20the%20High%20Priest\"&gt;Joshua the High Priest&lt;/a&gt;, in particular with Jeshua's grandson, the then current high priest &lt;a href=\"Eliashib%20%28High%20Priest%29\"&gt;Eliashib&lt;/a&gt;, and with Jeshua's great-grandson who had betrothed his son to a daughter of Sanballat, may form part of the context for the \"vision\" of Jeshua in a heavenly tribunal between the angel of the Lord and a Satan figure in &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Zechariah\"&gt;Book of Zechariah&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zechariah%203\"&gt;chapter 3&lt;/a&gt;. This connection between priestly intermarriage with the Samaritans and Sanballat's family in to the \"dirty clothes\" of Jeshua in Zechariah 3 was first asserted by &lt;a href=\"Rav%20Papa\"&gt;Rav Papa&lt;/a&gt; (300\u2013375) and in Christian circles by &lt;a href=\"Jerome\"&gt;Jerome&lt;/a&gt;. It is also noted by medieval Jewish commentators &lt;a href=\"David%20Kimhi\"&gt;David Kimhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rashi\"&gt;Rashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moses%20ibn%20Ezra\"&gt;Moses ibn Ezra&lt;/a&gt;, though ibn Ezra after considering the connection rejects it.\nJosephus.\n&lt;a href=\"Josephus\"&gt;Josephus&lt;/a&gt; (\"Antiquities\" xi. 7, \u00a7 2.) places Sanballat later on in Persian history, during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Darius%20III\"&gt;Darius III&lt;/a&gt; (336\u2013331 BCE). He likely confused this Sanballat with one of his successors, possibly &lt;a href=\"Sanballat%20II\"&gt;Sanballat II&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sanballat%20III\"&gt;Sanballat III&lt;/a&gt;. Josephus's story is probably a traditional account of the origin of the &lt;a href=\"Samaritans%23Persian%20period\"&gt;Samaritan Temple&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Gerizim\"&gt;Mount Gerizim&lt;/a&gt;. Josephus records the marriage of &lt;a href=\"Manasseh%20%28brother%20of%20Jaddua%29\"&gt;Manasseh&lt;/a&gt; and Sanballat's daughter from Nehemiah 13:28 as actually having taken place and causing the founding of the temple.\nElephantine papyri.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Elephantine%20papyri\"&gt;Elephantine papyri&lt;/a&gt; Sanballat is said to have had two sons, Delaiah bar Sanballat and Shelemiah bar Sanballat. The Jews of Elephantine asked for the help of Sanballat's sons in rebuilding the Jewish temple at Elephantine, which had been damaged or destroyed by rioters.\nModern research.\nAccording to Magen (2007) he appears to have been the scion of a veteran Samaritan family of the Israelite remnant originating in Horon, perhaps to be identified with the village of &lt;a href=\"Huwara\"&gt;Huwara&lt;/a&gt; at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Gerizim\"&gt;Mount Gerizim&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Yitzakh Magen's reconstruction, he was commander of a garrison force who rose to be appointed governor of Samaria, the first of the Israelites to achieve this rank, sometime prior to Nehemiah's return from exile, and arrival in Judea in 444 BCE. In order to unite Samaria and its populations, he thought a sacred site was necessary. The &lt;a href=\"Levite\"&gt;Levite&lt;/a&gt; priesthood had migrated to Judea, and the priests of Baal were idolatrous, and he chose from tradition Mount Gerizim, over whose site he chose a high priest from a noble family in Jerusalem, a grandson of Eliashib, to preside, and to whom he gave his own daughter in marriage. He established a temple to &lt;a href=\"YHWH\"&gt;YHWH&lt;/a&gt; on Mount Gerizim, over which his own descendants, as born into priestly blood, could minister. Josephus describes his construction of the Samaritan temple and says it was based on a copy of the Jerusalem temple. He also relates that many Israelites married to Samaritans moved to Samaria, causing much bewilderment in Jerusalem.\nModern use.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the radical nationalist poet and political activist &lt;a href=\"Uri%20Zvi%20Greenberg\"&gt;Uri Zvi Greenberg&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 considered the spiritual mentor of &lt;a href=\"Revisionist%20Zionism\"&gt;Revisionist Zionism&lt;/a&gt; and of the present &lt;a href=\"Israeli%20settlers\"&gt;Israeli settlers&lt;/a&gt; on the West Bank \u2013 regularly used the term \"The Sanballats\" or \"The Sanballat Gang\" (\u05db\u05e0\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05e1\u05e0\u05d1\u05dc\u05d8\u05d9\u05dd) as a catch-all term of abuse for antisemites and Palestinian nationalists as well as for political opponents from the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Zionist\"&gt;Socialist Zionist&lt;/a&gt; camp.\nReferences.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp%3Fartid%3D218%26amp%3Bletter%3DS%26amp%3Bsearch%3Dsanballat\"&gt;Jacobs, Joseph and Ira Price. \"Sanballat.\"&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;\".
