    "text": "Finian McGrath (born 9 April 1953) is an Irish former &lt;a href=\"Independent%20politicians%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt; politician who served as &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20State%20for%20Disability\"&gt;Minister of State for Disability Issues&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 to 2020. He served as a &lt;a href=\"Teachta%20D%C3%A1la\"&gt;Teachta D\u00e1la&lt;/a&gt; (TD) from 2002 to 2020.\nEarly and personal life.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Tuam\"&gt;Tuam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Galway\"&gt;County Galway&lt;/a&gt;, in 1953. He was educated at &lt;a href=\"University%20College%20Dublin\"&gt;University College Dublin&lt;/a&gt;. He went on to become a primary school principal at Scoil Pl\u00e1s Mhuire for Boys in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, before entering politics. He had two daughters with his wife Anne, who died in November 2009. McGrath was a contestant on the &lt;a href=\"Charity%20You%27re%20a%20Star\"&gt;\"You're a Star\" charity special&lt;/a&gt; in summer 2005, where he came in second. He released a charity single in December 2005, which featured the Christmas song \"&lt;a href=\"Angels%20We%20Have%20Heard%20on%20High\"&gt;Angels We Have Heard on High&lt;/a&gt;\" and the classic \"&lt;a href=\"Bad%2C%20Bad%20Leroy%20Brown\"&gt;Bad, Bad Leroy Brown&lt;/a&gt;\". All proceeds from the sales of this single were donated to &lt;a href=\"Down%20syndrome\"&gt;Down syndrome&lt;/a&gt; Ireland.\nPolitical career.\nHe was an unsuccessful candidate in the &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20North-Central%20%28D%C3%A1il%20constituency%29\"&gt;Dublin North-Central&lt;/a&gt; constituency at the &lt;a href=\"1992%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1997%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt; general elections. He was elected to &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20City%20Council\"&gt;Dublin City Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1999%20Irish%20local%20elections\"&gt;1999&lt;/a&gt;, with the second-highest vote in the &lt;a href=\"Clontarf%2C%20Dublin\"&gt;Clontarf&lt;/a&gt; local electoral area. He was first elected to &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A1il%20%C3%89ireann\"&gt;D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2002%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;2002 general election&lt;/a&gt;, where he stood as an &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Health%20Alliance\"&gt;Independent Health Alliance&lt;/a&gt; candidate in the Dublin North-Central constituency. He joined the &lt;a href=\"technical%20group\"&gt;technical group&lt;/a&gt;, established to ensure D\u00e1il speaking time for Independent TDs. In March 2003, due to being a &lt;a href=\"dual%20mandate\"&gt;dual mandate&lt;/a&gt; TD, he gave up his Dublin City Council seat to Ger Drogan, who later was replaced by Fintan Cassidy, who failed to get elected in the subsequent &lt;a href=\"2004%20Irish%20local%20elections\"&gt;2004 local elections&lt;/a&gt;.\nMcGrath was re-elected to the &lt;a href=\"30th%20D%C3%A1il\"&gt;30th D\u00e1il&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"2007%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;2007 general election&lt;/a&gt;, confounding predictions that he would lose due to the loss of a seat from the constituency. He garnered a large number of transfers from the &lt;a href=\"Sinn%20F%C3%A9in\"&gt;Sinn F\u00e9in&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; candidates.\nAs an Independent member of the 30th D\u00e1il, McGrath pledged his support for the new government formed in June 2007. In so doing, he secured a deal with &lt;a href=\"Taoiseach\"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bertie%20Ahern\"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt;, which he made public by entering it in the D\u00e1il record. This public announcement was hailed by many observers who had criticised other Independent TDs such as &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Lowry\"&gt;Michael Lowry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jackie%20Healy-Rae\"&gt;Jackie Healy-Rae&lt;/a&gt; for keeping similar deals secret. On 20 October 2008, &lt;a href=\"Fallout%20of%20the%202009%20Irish%20government%20budget\"&gt;following the 2009 Budget&lt;/a&gt;, McGrath withdrew his support for the government in protest at the abolition of an automatic medical card for the over-70s, cuts in education and the increase of the pupil-teacher ratio. Following the election of &lt;a href=\"Pearse%20Doherty\"&gt;Pearse Doherty&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"D%C3%A1il\"&gt;D\u00e1il&lt;/a&gt;, McGrath joined the Technical group, which consisted of the Sinn F\u00e9in deputies and the Independent &lt;a href=\"Maureen%20O%27Sullivan%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Maureen O'Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;. He was re-elected at the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;2011 general election&lt;/a&gt;, where he served as chair of the Technical group.\nMcGrath endorsed the Independent candidate Damien O'Farrell at the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Irish%20local%20elections\"&gt;2009 local elections&lt;/a&gt; for the Clontarf local electoral area in &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20City%20Council\"&gt;Dublin City Council&lt;/a&gt;, who was elected topping the poll.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Irish%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2011 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, McGrath initially agreed to support Senator &lt;a href=\"David%20Norris%20%28politician%29\"&gt;David Norris&lt;/a&gt; for nomination as a candidate. On 2 August, Norris publicly announced at a press conference that he was withdrawing from the presidential race. This followed the decision of McGrath, and the TDs &lt;a href=\"John%20Halligan%20%28politician%29\"&gt;John Halligan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Pringle%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Thomas Pringle&lt;/a&gt; to withdraw their support following revelations that Norris had written a letter to an Israeli court asking &lt;a href=\"pardon\"&gt;clemency&lt;/a&gt; for his former partner &lt;a href=\"Ezra%20Nawi\"&gt;Ezra Nawi&lt;/a&gt;, who was then facing criminal charges. Norris withdrew his candidacy on 2 August due to the controversy. Sinn F\u00e9in proposed &lt;a href=\"Martin%20McGuinness\"&gt;Martin McGuinness&lt;/a&gt; for their nomination for a presidential candidate. McGrath agreed, along with four other independent TDs, to sign McGuinness's nomination paper.\nMcGrath resigned as chair of the technical group in October 2012, after a dispute with &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Wallace\"&gt;Mick Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, over Wallace's participation in the loose alliance related to speaking rights in the D\u00e1il. He joined the &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Alliance%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Independent Alliance&lt;/a&gt; at its inception in 2016. He contested the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;2016 general election&lt;/a&gt; under that banner, in &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20Bay%20North%20%28D%C3%A1il%20constituency%29\"&gt;Dublin Bay North&lt;/a&gt; owing to the abolition of Dublin North-Central. He was re-elected to the D\u00e1il and then entered &lt;a href=\"2016%20Irish%20government%20formation\"&gt;talks on government formation&lt;/a&gt;. On 6 May 2016, he &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%2032nd%20D%C3%A1il\"&gt;entered Government&lt;/a&gt; with Fine Gael, under Taoiseach &lt;a href=\"Enda%20Kenny\"&gt;Enda Kenny&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20State%20for%20Disability\"&gt;Minister of State for Disability Issues&lt;/a&gt;. McGrath was also appointed a \"Super Junior Minister\", meaning he attends &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; meetings but cannot vote.\nIn January 2020, in advance of the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Irish%20general%20election\"&gt;2020 general election&lt;/a&gt;, McGrath announced that he would not be seeking re-election, but would return to other forms of political activism to support people with disabilities.\nPolitical beliefs.\nDescribing himself as \"someone who comes from the tradition of &lt;a href=\"Wolfe%20Tone\"&gt;Tone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Connolly\"&gt;Connolly&lt;/a&gt;\", McGrath holds left-wing political views. He has cited &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"disability\"&gt;disability&lt;/a&gt; as his policy priorities. He has also campaigned against the &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20War\"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; and the U.S. military's use of &lt;a href=\"Shannon%20Airport\"&gt;Shannon Airport&lt;/a&gt; as a stopover, and on local environmental issues.\nMcGrath has spoken in support of &lt;a href=\"Fidel%20Castro\"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Socialism\"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; government in &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. When challenged on Cuba's supposed poor human rights record, McGrath replied that \"Cuba has a different kind of democracy to Ireland.\""
