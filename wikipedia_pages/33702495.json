    "text": "The 2012 mid-year rugby union tests (also known as the Summer Internationals in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Hemisphere\"&gt;Northern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;) refer to the &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; Internationals that were played through June, mostly in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Hemisphere\"&gt;Southern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese matches marked the start of a global rugby calendar established by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Rugby%20Board\"&gt;International Rugby Board&lt;/a&gt; (IRB), which runs until 2019. The calendar includes a return of traditional tours by European teams, in which a team plays multiple Tests against a southern hemisphere side, often with mid-week matches against provincial or regional sides. This year, all three of the teams that competed in the Rugby Championship's predecessor tournament, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;Tri Nations&lt;/a&gt;, hosted European nations in three-Test series. &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; hosted &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, marking the first three-Test series in Australia by a top European side since the &lt;a href=\"British%20%26amp%3B%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British &amp; Irish Lions&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"2001%20British%20%26amp%3B%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Australia\"&gt;2001 tour&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; hosted &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; for three Tests, the first extended tour of that country by a single nation since New Zealand toured in 1996.\nThe new calendar also provided expanded Test opportunities for so-called \"Tier 2\" nations. As part of this IRB initiative, another tradition returned\u2014tours of the Pacific Islands by major nations. &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; became the first Tier 1 nation to play a Test in the Pacific Islands since 2006, visiting &lt;a href=\"Fiji%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Samoa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt;. Also, Italy toured the Americas, claiming wins over &lt;a href=\"Canada%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and a loss to &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;."
