    "text": "French Guiana ( or ; ) is an &lt;a href=\"overseas%20departments%20and%20regions%20of%20France\"&gt;overseas department/region&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"single%20territorial%20collectivity\"&gt;single territorial collectivity&lt;/a&gt; of France on the northern &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; coast of South America in &lt;a href=\"the%20Guianas\"&gt;the Guianas&lt;/a&gt;. It borders Brazil to the east and south and &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt; to the west.\nWith a land area of , French Guiana is the second-largest &lt;a href=\"Regions%20of%20France\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; of France (more than one-seventh the size of &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20France\"&gt;Metropolitan France&lt;/a&gt;) and the largest &lt;a href=\"Special%20member%20state%20territories%20and%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;outermost region&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. It has very low population density, with only . (Its population is less than that of Metropolitan France.) Half of its 294,436 inhabitants in 2022 lived in the metropolitan area of &lt;a href=\"Cayenne\"&gt;Cayenne&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href=\"Prefectures%20in%20France\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;. 98.9% of the land territory of French Guiana is covered by forests, a large part of which is &lt;a href=\"Old-growth%20forest\"&gt;primeval&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20rainforest\"&gt;rainforest&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Guiana%20Amazonian%20Park\"&gt;Guiana Amazonian Park&lt;/a&gt;, which is the largest &lt;a href=\"national%20park\"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt; in the European Union, covers 41% of French Guiana's territory.\nSince December 2015, both the region and department have been ruled by a single assembly within the framework of a new &lt;a href=\"territorial%20collectivity\"&gt;territorial collectivity&lt;/a&gt;, the French Guiana Territorial Collectivity (). This assembly, the French Guiana Assembly (), replaced the former &lt;a href=\"Regional%20Council%20of%20French%20Guiana\"&gt;regional council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Council%20of%20French%20Guiana\"&gt;departmental council&lt;/a&gt;, which were disbanded. The French Guiana Assembly is in charge of regional and departmental government. Its president is &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Serville\"&gt;Gabriel Serville&lt;/a&gt;.\nFully integrated in the &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French Republic&lt;/a&gt; since 1946, French Guiana is a part of the European Union, and its official currency is the &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;. A large part of French Guiana's economy depends on jobs and businesses associated with the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Guiana%20Space%20Centre\"&gt;Guiana Space Centre&lt;/a&gt;, now the &lt;a href=\"European%20Space%20Agency\"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s primary launch site near the equator. As elsewhere in France, the official language is standard French, but each ethnic community has its own language, of which &lt;a href=\"French%20Guianese%20Creole\"&gt;French Guianese Creole&lt;/a&gt;, a French-based &lt;a href=\"creole%20language\"&gt;creole language&lt;/a&gt;, is the most widely spoken.\nName.\nThe addition of the adjective \"French\" in most languages other than French is rooted in colonial times, when five such colonies (&lt;a href=\"The%20Guianas\"&gt;The Guianas&lt;/a&gt;) had been named along the coast, subject to differing powers: namely (from west to east) Spanish Guiana (now &lt;a href=\"Guayana%20Region\"&gt;Guayana Region&lt;/a&gt; in Venezuela), &lt;a href=\"British%20Guiana\"&gt;British Guiana&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Guyana\"&gt;Guyana&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Surinam%20%28Dutch%20colony%29\"&gt;Dutch Guiana&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;), French Guiana, and &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Guiana\"&gt;Portuguese Guiana&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Amap%C3%A1\"&gt;Amap\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; in Brazil). French Guiana and the two larger countries to the north and west, Guyana and Suriname, are still often collectively referred to as \"the Guianas\" and constitute one large landmass known as the &lt;a href=\"Guiana%20Shield\"&gt;Guiana Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFrench Guiana was originally inhabited by &lt;a href=\"indigenous%20people\"&gt;indigenous people&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Kalina%20people\"&gt;Kalina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arawak\"&gt;Arawak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galibi\"&gt;Galibi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Palikur\"&gt;Palikur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teko%2C%20tribe\"&gt;Teko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayampi\"&gt;Wayampi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayana\"&gt;Wayana&lt;/a&gt;. The French attempted to create a colony there in the 16th century in conjunction with its settlement of some Caribbean islands, such as Guadeloupe and &lt;a href=\"Saint-Domingue\"&gt;Saint-Domingue&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;European colonization&lt;/a&gt;, the territory was originally inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20South%20America\"&gt;Native Americans&lt;/a&gt;, most speaking the &lt;a href=\"Arawak%20language\"&gt;Arawak language&lt;/a&gt;, of the Arawakan language family. The people identified as &lt;a href=\"Lokono\"&gt;Lokono&lt;/a&gt;. The first French establishment is recorded in 1503, but France did not establish a durable presence until colonists founded &lt;a href=\"Cayenne\"&gt;Cayenne&lt;/a&gt; in 1643. Guiana was developed as a &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20slave%20trade\"&gt;slave society&lt;/a&gt;, where planters imported Africans as enslaved labourers on large sugar and other plantations in such number as to increase the population. The system of slavery in French Guiana continued until the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"National%20Convention\"&gt;National Convention&lt;/a&gt; voted to abolish the French slave trade and slavery in &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20empire\"&gt;France's overseas colonies&lt;/a&gt; in February 1794, months after enslaved Haitians had started a &lt;a href=\"Haitian%20Revolution\"&gt;slave rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in the colony of &lt;a href=\"Saint-Domingue\"&gt;Saint-Domingue&lt;/a&gt;. However, the 1794 decree was only implemented in Saint-Domingue, &lt;a href=\"Guadeloupe\"&gt;Guadeloupe&lt;/a&gt; and French Guiana, while the colonies of &lt;a href=\"Senegal\"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mauritius\"&gt;Mauritius&lt;/a&gt;, R\u00e9union and &lt;a href=\"Martinique\"&gt;Martinique&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"French%20India\"&gt;French India&lt;/a&gt; resisted the imposition of these laws.\nBill Marshall, Professor of Comparative Cultural Studies at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Stirling\"&gt;University of Stirling&lt;/a&gt; wrote of French Guiana's origins:\n\"&lt;a href=\"%C3%8Ele%20du%20Diable\"&gt;\u00cele du Diable&lt;/a&gt;\" (Devil's Island) was the site of a small prison facility, part of a larger penal system by the same name, which consisted of prisons on three islands and three larger prisons on the mainland. This was operated from 1852 to 1953. \nIn addition, in the late nineteenth century, France began requiring forced residencies by prisoners who survived their hard labour. A Portuguese-British naval squadron &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Cayenne%20%281809%29\"&gt;took French Guiana&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Empire\"&gt;Portuguese Empire&lt;/a&gt; in 1809. It was returned to France with the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281814%29\"&gt;Treaty of Paris&lt;/a&gt; in 1814. Though Portugal returned the region to France, it kept a military presence until 1817.\nAfter French Guiana was established as a penal colony, officials sometimes used convicts to catch butterflies. The sentences of the convicts were often long, and the prospect of employment very weak, so the convicts caught butterflies to sell in the international market, both for scientific purposes as well as general collecting.\nA border dispute with Brazil arose in the late 19th century over a vast area of jungle, resulting in the short-lived, pro-French, independent state of &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Independent%20Guyana\"&gt;Counani&lt;/a&gt; in the disputed territory. There was some fighting among settlers. The dispute was resolved largely in favour of Brazil by the &lt;a href=\"arbitration\"&gt;arbitration&lt;/a&gt; of the Swiss government.\nThe territory of &lt;a href=\"Inini\"&gt;Inini&lt;/a&gt; consisted of most of the interior of French Guiana when it was created in 1930. It was abolished in 1946, the year that French Guiana as a whole was formally established as an &lt;a href=\"overseas%20department\"&gt;overseas department&lt;/a&gt; of France. In 1936, &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9lix%20%C3%89bou%C3%A9\"&gt;F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; from Cayenne became the first black man to serve as governor in a French colony.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and the fall of France to Nazi German forces, French Guiana became part of &lt;a href=\"Vichy%20France\"&gt;Vichy France&lt;/a&gt;. Guiana officially rallied to &lt;a href=\"Free%20France\"&gt;Free France&lt;/a&gt; on 16 March 1943. It abandoned its colony status and once again became a French &lt;a href=\"Overseas%20department%20and%20region\"&gt;department&lt;/a&gt; on 19 March 1946.\nFollowing the French withdrawal from Vietnam in the 1950s and subsequent warfare conducted in the region by the United States, France helped resettle several hundred &lt;a href=\"Hmong%20people\"&gt;Hmong refugees from Laos&lt;/a&gt; to French Guiana during the 1970s and 80s, who were fleeing displacement after the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Laos%20since%201945%23Communist%20Laos%20%281975%E2%80%931991%29\"&gt;communist takeover of Laos&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Pathet%20Lao\"&gt;Pathet Lao&lt;/a&gt; in 1975.\nIn the late 1980s, more than 10,000 &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;se refugees, mostly &lt;a href=\"Maroons\"&gt;Maroons&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in French Guiana, fleeing the &lt;a href=\"Surinamese%20Interior%20War\"&gt;Surinamese Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore recently, French Guiana has received large numbers of Brazilian and Haitian &lt;a href=\"economic%20migrant\"&gt;economic migrant&lt;/a&gt;s. Illegal and ecologically destructive &lt;a href=\"gold%20mining\"&gt;gold mining&lt;/a&gt; by Brazilian is a chronic issue in the remote interior rain forest of French Guiana. The region still faces such problems as illegal immigration, poorer infrastructure than mainland France, higher costs of living, higher levels of crime and more common social unrest.\nIn 1964, French president &lt;a href=\"Charles%20de%20Gaulle\"&gt;Charles de Gaulle&lt;/a&gt; decided to construct a space-travel base in French Guiana. It was intended to replace the Sahara base in &lt;a href=\"Algeria\"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt; and stimulate economic growth in French Guiana. The department was considered suitable for the purpose because it is near the &lt;a href=\"equator\"&gt;equator&lt;/a&gt; and has extensive access to the ocean as a buffer zone. The &lt;a href=\"Guiana%20Space%20Centre\"&gt;Guiana Space Centre&lt;/a&gt;, located a short distance along the coast from &lt;a href=\"Kourou\"&gt;Kourou&lt;/a&gt;, has grown considerably since the initial launches of the &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A9ronique%20%28rocket%29\"&gt;V\u00e9ronique&lt;/a&gt; rockets. It is now part of the European space industry and has had commercial success with such launches as the &lt;a href=\"Ariane%204\"&gt;Ariane 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ariane%205\"&gt;Ariane 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ariane%20flight%20VA256\"&gt;Ariane flight VA256&lt;/a&gt; which launched the &lt;a href=\"James%20Webb%20Space%20Telescope\"&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; into space.\nThe Guianese General Council officially adopted a &lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;departmental&lt;/a&gt; flag in 2010. In a &lt;a href=\"2010%20French%20Guianan%20status%20referendum\"&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; that same year, French Guiana voted against autonomy.\nOn 20 March 2017, French Guianese workers began &lt;a href=\"2017%20social%20unrest%20in%20French%20Guiana\"&gt;going on strike and demonstrating for more resources and infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. 28 March 2017 was the day of the largest demonstration ever held in French Guiana.\nFrench Guiana has been impacted severely by the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20French%20Guiana\"&gt;COVID-19 outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 1% of French Guianese testing positive by the end of June 2020.\nGeography.\nFrench Guiana lies between latitudes &lt;a href=\"3rd%20parallel%20north\"&gt;3\u00b0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"6th%20parallel%20north\"&gt;6\u00b0&lt;/a&gt; N, and longitudes &lt;a href=\"51st%20meridian%20west\"&gt;51\u00b0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"55th%20meridian%20west\"&gt;55\u00b0&lt;/a&gt; W. It consists of two main geographical regions: a coastal strip where the majority of the people live, and dense, near-inaccessible &lt;a href=\"rainforest\"&gt;rainforest&lt;/a&gt; which gradually rises to the modest peaks of the &lt;a href=\"Tumuk%20Humak%20Mountains\"&gt;Tumuc-Humac mountains&lt;/a&gt; along the Brazilian frontier. French Guiana's highest peak is &lt;a href=\"Bellevue%20de%20l%27Inini\"&gt;Bellevue de l'Inini&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maripasoula\"&gt;Maripasoula&lt;/a&gt; (). Other mountains include &lt;a href=\"Mont%20Itoup%C3%A9\"&gt;Mont Itoup\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Cottica%20Mountain\"&gt;Cottica Mountain&lt;/a&gt; (), &lt;a href=\"Pic%20Coudreau\"&gt;Pic Coudreau&lt;/a&gt; (), and &lt;a href=\"Kaw%20Mountain\"&gt;Kaw Mountain&lt;/a&gt; ().\nSeveral small islands are found off the coast: the three &lt;a href=\"Salvation%27s%20Islands\"&gt;Salvation's Islands&lt;/a&gt; which include &lt;a href=\"Devil%27s%20Island%20%28Kourou%29\"&gt;Devil's Island&lt;/a&gt;, and the isolated &lt;a href=\"%C3%8Eles%20du%20Conn%C3%A9table\"&gt;\u00celes du Conn\u00e9table&lt;/a&gt; bird sanctuary further along the coast towards Brazil.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Petit-Saut%20Dam\"&gt;Petit-Saut Dam&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dam%23Power%20generation%20plant\"&gt;hydroelectric dam&lt;/a&gt; in the north of French Guiana forms an &lt;a href=\"Reservoir\"&gt;artificial lake&lt;/a&gt; and provides &lt;a href=\"hydroelectricity\"&gt;hydroelectricity&lt;/a&gt;. There are many rivers in French Guiana, including the &lt;a href=\"Waki%20%28river%29\"&gt;Waki River&lt;/a&gt;.\n, the &lt;a href=\"Amazonian%20forest\"&gt;Amazonian forest&lt;/a&gt;, located in the most remote part of the department, is protected as the &lt;a href=\"Guiana%20Amazonian%20Park\"&gt;Guiana Amazonian Park&lt;/a&gt;, one of the ten &lt;a href=\"national%20parks%20of%20France\"&gt;national parks of France&lt;/a&gt;. The territory of the park covers some upon the &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20the%20Guyane%20department\"&gt;communes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Camopi\"&gt;Camopi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maripasoula\"&gt;Maripasoula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Papa%C3%AFchton\"&gt;Papa\u00efchton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saint-%C3%89lie\"&gt;Saint-\u00c9lie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sa%C3%BCl\"&gt;Sa\u00fcl&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nFrench Guiana has a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20rainforest%20climate\"&gt;tropical rainforest climate&lt;/a&gt; predominant. Located within six degrees of the &lt;a href=\"Equator\"&gt;Equator&lt;/a&gt; and rising only to modest elevations, French Guiana is hot and oppressively humid all year round. During most of the year, rainfall across the country is heavy due to the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Intertropical%20Convergence%20Zone\"&gt;Intertropical Convergence Zone&lt;/a&gt; and its powerful thunderstorm cells. In most parts of French Guiana, rainfall is always heavy especially from December to July \u2013 typically over can be expected each month during this period throughout the department. Between August and November, the eastern half experiences a &lt;a href=\"dry%20season\"&gt;\"hot and dry\" season&lt;/a&gt; with rainfall below and average high temperatures above occurring in September and October, causing eastern French Guiana to be classified as a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20monsoon%20climate\"&gt;tropical monsoon climate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen&lt;/a&gt; \"Am\"); Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni in the west has a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20rainforest%20climate\"&gt;tropical rainforest climate&lt;/a&gt; (\"Af\").\nEnvironment.\nFrench Guiana is home to many different &lt;a href=\"ecosystem\"&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"tropical%20rainforest\"&gt;tropical rainforest&lt;/a&gt;s, coastal &lt;a href=\"mangroves\"&gt;mangroves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"savannahs\"&gt;savannahs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"inselberg\"&gt;inselberg&lt;/a&gt;s and many types of &lt;a href=\"wetlands\"&gt;wetlands&lt;/a&gt;. It lies within three ecoregions: &lt;a href=\"Guayanan%20Highlands%20moist%20forests\"&gt;Guayanan Highlands moist forests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guianan%20moist%20forests\"&gt;Guianan moist forests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Guianan%20mangroves\"&gt;Guianan mangroves&lt;/a&gt;. French Guiana has a high level of &lt;a href=\"biodiversity\"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt; of both &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fauna\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;. This is due to the presence of &lt;a href=\"primary%20forest\"&gt;old-growth forests&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., ancient/primary forests), which are &lt;a href=\"biodiversity%20hotspot\"&gt;biodiversity hotspot&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"rainforest\"&gt;rainforest&lt;/a&gt;s of French Guiana provide shelter for many species during dry periods and terrestrial glaciation. These forests are protected by a national park (the &lt;a href=\"Guiana%20Amazonian%20Park\"&gt;Guiana Amazonian Park&lt;/a&gt;), seven additional &lt;a href=\"nature%20reserve\"&gt;nature reserve&lt;/a&gt;s, and 17 &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20protected%20areas%20of%20French%20Guiana\"&gt;protected&lt;/a&gt; sites. The &lt;a href=\"International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature\"&gt;International Union for Conservation of Nature&lt;/a&gt; (IUCN) and the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU) have recommended special efforts to protect these areas.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Grenelle%20Environnement\"&gt;Grenelle Environment Round Table&lt;/a&gt; of 2007, the Grenelle Law II was proposed in 2009, under law number 2010\u2013788. Article 49 of the law proposed the creation of a single organization responsible for environmental conservation in French Guiana. Article 64 proposes a \"departmental plan of mining orientation\" for French Guiana, which would promote mining (specifically of gold) that is compatible with requirements for environmental protection. The coastal environment along the &lt;a href=\"Route%20nationale%201%20%28French%20Guiana%29\"&gt;RN1&lt;/a&gt; has historically experienced the most changes, but development is occurring locally along the &lt;a href=\"Route%20nationale%202%20%28French%20Guiana%29\"&gt;RN2&lt;/a&gt;, and also in western French Guiana due to gold mining.\n5,500 plant species have been recorded, including more than a thousand trees, along with 700 species of birds, 177 species of mammals, over 500 species of fish including 45% of which are &lt;a href=\"endemism\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; and 109 species of &lt;a href=\"amphibian\"&gt;amphibian&lt;/a&gt;s. The micro-organisms would be much more numerous, especially in the north, which competes with the Brazilian Amazon, &lt;a href=\"Borneo\"&gt;Borneo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThreats to the ecosystem are: &lt;a href=\"habitat%20fragmentation\"&gt;habitat fragmentation&lt;/a&gt; from roads, which remains very limited compared to other forests of South America; immediate and deferred impacts of &lt;a href=\"Electricite%20de%20France\"&gt;EDF&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Petit-Saut%20Dam\"&gt;Petit-Saut Dam&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"gold%20mining\"&gt;gold mining&lt;/a&gt;; poor control of hunting and &lt;a href=\"poaching\"&gt;poaching&lt;/a&gt;, facilitated by the creation of many tracks; and the introduction of &lt;a href=\"all-terrain%20vehicle\"&gt;all-terrain vehicle&lt;/a&gt;s. Logging remains moderate due to the lack of roads, difficult climate, and difficult terrain. The Forest Code of French Guiana was modified by ordinance on 28 July 2005. Logging concessions or free transfers are sometimes granted by local authorities to persons traditionally deriving their livelihood from the forest.\nThe beaches of the &lt;a href=\"Amana%20Nature%20Reserve\"&gt;Amana Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt; are an exceptional marine turtle nesting site. This is one of the largest worldwide for the &lt;a href=\"leatherback%20turtle\"&gt;leatherback turtle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAgriculture.\nFrench Guiana has some of the poorest soils in the world. The soil is low in nutrients (e.g., &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potassium\"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"organic%20matter\"&gt;organic matter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Soil%20acidity\"&gt;Soil acidity&lt;/a&gt; is another cause of the poor soils, and it requires farmers to &lt;a href=\"Liming%20%28soil%29\"&gt;add lime&lt;/a&gt; to their fields. The soil characteristics have led to the use of &lt;a href=\"slash%20and%20burn\"&gt;slash and burn&lt;/a&gt; agriculture. The resulting ashes elevate soil &lt;a href=\"pH\"&gt;pH&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., lower soil acidity), and contribute &lt;a href=\"minerals\"&gt;minerals&lt;/a&gt; and other nutrients to the soil. Sites of &lt;a href=\"Terra%20preta\"&gt;Terra preta&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment\"&gt;anthropogenic&lt;/a&gt; soils) have been discovered in French Guiana, particularly near the border with Brazil. Research is being actively pursued in multiple fields to determine how these enriched soils were historically created, and how this can be done in modern times.\nEconomy.\nAs a part of France, French Guiana is part of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eurozone\"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt;; its currency is the &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;. The country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for French Guiana is &lt;a href=\".gf\"&gt;.gf&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\".fr\"&gt;.fr&lt;/a&gt; is generally used instead.\nIn 2019, the GDP of French Guiana at market exchange rates was US$4.87\u00a0billion (\u20ac4.35\u00a0billion), ranking as the 2nd largest economy in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Guianas\"&gt;Guianas&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Guyana\"&gt;Guyana&lt;/a&gt; (which discovered large oil fields in 2015 and 2018), and the 12th largest in South America.\nFrench Guiana is heavily dependent on mainland France for subsidies, trade, and goods. The main traditional industries are fishing (accounting for 5% of exports in 2012), gold mining (accounting for 32% of exports in 2012) and timber (accounting for 1% of exports in 2012). In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Guiana%20Space%20Centre\"&gt;Guiana Space Centre&lt;/a&gt; has played a significant role in the local economy since it was established in &lt;a href=\"Kourou\"&gt;Kourou&lt;/a&gt; in 1964: it accounted directly and indirectly for 16% of French Guiana's GDP in 2002 (down from 26% in 1994, as the French Guianese economy is becoming increasingly diversified). The Guiana Space Centre employed 1,659 people in 2012.\nThere is very little manufacturing. Agriculture is largely undeveloped and is mainly confined to the area near the coast and along the &lt;a href=\"Maroni%20%28river%29\"&gt;Maroni River&lt;/a&gt;. Sugar and bananas were traditionally two of the main &lt;a href=\"cash%20crop\"&gt;cash crop&lt;/a&gt;s grown for export but have almost completely disappeared. Today they have been replaced by livestock raising (essentially beef cattle and pigs) in the coastal savannas between &lt;a href=\"Cayenne\"&gt;Cayenne&lt;/a&gt; and the second-largest town, &lt;a href=\"Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni\"&gt;Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"market%20gardening\"&gt;market gardening&lt;/a&gt; (fruits and vegetables) developed by the &lt;a href=\"Hmong%20people\"&gt;Hmong&lt;/a&gt; communities settled in French Guiana in the 1970s, both destined to the local market. A thriving rice production, developed on &lt;a href=\"polder\"&gt;polder&lt;/a&gt;s near &lt;a href=\"Mana%2C%20French%20Guiana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt; from the early 1980s to the late 2000s, has almost completely disappeared since 2011 due to marine erosion and new &lt;a href=\"Directorate-General%20for%20Health%20and%20Consumers\"&gt;EU plant health rules&lt;/a&gt; which forbid the use of many pesticides and fertilizers. Tourism, especially &lt;a href=\"ecotourism\"&gt;eco-tourism&lt;/a&gt;, is growing. Unemployment has been persistently high in the last few decades: 20% to 25% (22.3% in 2012).\nIn 2019, the &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20countries%20by%20GDP%20%28nominal%29%20per%20capita\"&gt;GDP per capita&lt;/a&gt; of French Guiana at market exchange rates, not at &lt;a href=\"purchasing%20power%20parity\"&gt;PPP&lt;/a&gt;, was US$17,099 (\u20ac15,272), only 41.7% of &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20France\"&gt;metropolitan France&lt;/a&gt;'s average GDP per capita that year, and 49.0% of the metropolitan French regions outside the &lt;a href=\"%C3%8Ele-de-France\"&gt;Paris Region&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"2017%20social%20unrest%20in%20French%20Guiana\"&gt;Social unrest in 2017&lt;/a&gt; paralyzed the economy for several weeks and led to an economic recession (\u22123.5% in &lt;a href=\"Real%20versus%20nominal%20value%20%28economics%29\"&gt;real terms&lt;/a&gt;), which sunk the GDP per capita that year. The economy rebounded in 2018 (+2.8%) and in 2019 (+4.1%).\nDemographics.\nFrench Guiana's population of 294,436 (Jan. 2022 estimate), most of whom live along the coast, is substantially ethnically diverse. At the 2014 census, 57.3% of the inhabitants of French Guiana were born in French Guiana, 9.3% were born in &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20France\"&gt;Metropolitan France&lt;/a&gt;, 3.0% were born in the French &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"departments%20of%20France\"&gt;departments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"overseas%20collectivity\"&gt;collectivities&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Guadeloupe\"&gt;Guadeloupe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martinique\"&gt;Martinique&lt;/a&gt; etc.), and 30.2% were born in foreign countries (primarily &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil, and &lt;a href=\"Haiti\"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;).\nEstimates of the percentages of French Guiana ethnic composition are difficult to produce due to the presence of a large proportion of immigrants. People of mixed African and French ancestry are the largest ethnic group, though estimates vary as to the exact percentage, depending upon whether the large &lt;a href=\"Haitians\"&gt;Haitian&lt;/a&gt; community is included as well. Generally, the Creole population is judged to be about 60\u201370% of the total population if Haitians (comprising roughly one-third of Creoles) are included, and 30\u201350% otherwise. There are also smaller groups from various &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; islands, mainly Martinique, Guadeloupe, and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Lucia\"&gt;Saint Lucia&lt;/a&gt;.\nApproximately 41,000 people or 14% of the population is of European ancestry. The vast majority of these are of French ancestry, though there are also people of Spanish and &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20people\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; ancestry.\nThe main Asian communities are the &lt;a href=\"Overseas%20Chinese\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; (about 3\u20134%, primarily from &lt;a href=\"Zhejiang\"&gt;Zhejiang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guangdong\"&gt;Guangdong&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"mainland%20China\"&gt;mainland China&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Hmong%20people\"&gt;Hmong&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Laos\"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt; (1\u20132%). Other groups from Asia include &lt;a href=\"Indians%20in%20French%20Guiana\"&gt;East Indians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lebanese%20people\"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vietnamese%20people\"&gt;Vietnamese&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main groups living in the interior are the &lt;a href=\"Maroon%20%28people%29\"&gt;Maroons&lt;/a&gt; who are of African descent, and &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Amerindians&lt;/a&gt;. The Maroons, descendants of escaped African slaves, live primarily along the &lt;a href=\"Maroni%20River\"&gt;Maroni River&lt;/a&gt;. The main Maroon groups are the Saramaca, Aucan (both of whom also live in &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;), and Boni (&lt;a href=\"Aluku\"&gt;Aluku&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe main Amerindian groups (forming about 3\u20134% of the population) are the &lt;a href=\"Arawaks\"&gt;Arawak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalina%20people\"&gt;Carib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emerillon%20people\"&gt;Emerillon&lt;/a&gt; (now called the &lt;a href=\"Teko%20people\"&gt;Teko&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Galibi\"&gt;Galibi&lt;/a&gt; (now called the &lt;a href=\"Kali%C3%B1a\"&gt;Kali\u00f1a&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Palikur%20people\"&gt;Palikur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayampi\"&gt;Wayampi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayana\"&gt;Wayana&lt;/a&gt;. As of the late 1990s, there was evidence of an &lt;a href=\"Uncontacted%20peoples\"&gt;uncontacted group&lt;/a&gt; of Wayampi.\nImmigration.\nIn recent years, French Guiana has seen an increase in &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20refugees\"&gt;Syrian refugees&lt;/a&gt; trying to escape the &lt;a href=\"Syrian%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Syrian Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. For them and other groups of migrants, the majority arriving from Latin American and Middle Eastern countries (especially &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yemen\"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Palestine\"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;), its status as French territory makes it a \"gateway\" to Europe. Many live in crowded &lt;a href=\"refugee%20camps\"&gt;refugee camps&lt;/a&gt; with poor conditions and little protection from the elements. Neither local authorities nor the French government have made significant efforts to help the situation.\nReligion.\nThe dominant religion of French Guiana is &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism\"&gt;Roman Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;; the Maroons and some Amerindian peoples maintain their own religions. The Hmong people are also largely Catholic owing to the influence of missionaries who helped bring them to French Guiana. &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20French%20Guiana\"&gt;Guianan Catholics&lt;/a&gt; are part of the &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Cayenne\"&gt;Diocese of Cayenne&lt;/a&gt;.\nFertility.\nThe &lt;a href=\"total%20fertility%20rate\"&gt;total fertility rate&lt;/a&gt; in French Guiana has remained high and is today considerably higher than that of &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20France\"&gt;metropolitan France&lt;/a&gt;, as well as most of the other &lt;a href=\"Overseas%20department\"&gt;French overseas departments&lt;/a&gt;. It is largely responsible for the rapid population growth of French Guiana.\nLanguages.\nThe official language of French Guiana is French, and it is the predominant language of the department, spoken by most residents as a first or second language. In addition, a number of other local languages exist. Regional languages include &lt;a href=\"French%20Guianese%20Creole\"&gt;French Guianese Creole&lt;/a&gt; (not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"Guyanese%20Creole\"&gt;Guyanese Creole&lt;/a&gt;), six &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20languages%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Amerindian languages&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Arawakan%20languages\"&gt;Arawak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Palikur%20language\"&gt;Palijur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carib%20language\"&gt;Kali'na&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayana%20language\"&gt;Wayana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayampi%20language\"&gt;Wayampi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emerillon%20language\"&gt;Emerillon&lt;/a&gt;), four &lt;a href=\"Maroon%20%28people%29\"&gt;Maroon&lt;/a&gt; creole languages (&lt;a href=\"Saramaka%20language\"&gt;Saramaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paramaccan%20language\"&gt;Paramaccan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aluku%20language\"&gt;Aluku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ndyuka%20language\"&gt;Ndyuka&lt;/a&gt;), as well as &lt;a href=\"Hmong%20Njua\"&gt;Hmong Njua&lt;/a&gt;. Other languages spoken include English, &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20language\"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mandarin%20Chinese\"&gt;Mandarin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haitian%20Creole%20language\"&gt;Haitian Creole&lt;/a&gt; and Spanish.\nPolitics.\nFrench Guiana, as part of France, forms part of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the largest landmass for an area outside of Europe (since &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt; left the European Community in 1985), with one of the longest EU external boundaries. It is one of only three &lt;a href=\"Special%20member%20state%20territories%20and%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;European Union territories outside Europe&lt;/a&gt; that is not an island (the others being the Spanish Autonomous Cities in Africa, &lt;a href=\"Ceuta\"&gt;Ceuta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melilla\"&gt;Melilla&lt;/a&gt;). As an integral part of France, its &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20France\"&gt;President of the French Republic&lt;/a&gt;, and its head of government is the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20France\"&gt;Prime Minister of France&lt;/a&gt;. The French Government and its agencies have responsibility for a wide range of issues that are reserved to the national executive power, such as defense and external relations.\nThe President of France appoints a &lt;a href=\"Prefect%20%28France%29\"&gt;prefect&lt;/a&gt; (resident at the &lt;a href=\"Prefectures%20in%20France\"&gt;prefecture building&lt;/a&gt; in Cayenne) as his representative to head the local government of French Guiana. There is one elected, local executive body, the Assembl\u00e9e de Guyane.\nFrench Guiana sends two &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;deputies&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20of%20France\"&gt;French National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, one representing the &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20France\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; (municipality) of &lt;a href=\"Cayenne\"&gt;Cayenne&lt;/a&gt; and the commune of &lt;a href=\"Macouria\"&gt;Macouria&lt;/a&gt;, and the other representing the rest of French Guiana. This latter constituency is the largest in the French Republic by land area. French Guiana also sends two senators to the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20France\"&gt;French Senate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Guianese%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Guianese Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; dominated politics in French Guiana until 2010.\nA chronic issue affecting French Guiana is the influx of illegal immigrants and clandestine &lt;a href=\"gold%20prospecting\"&gt;gold prospectors&lt;/a&gt; from Brazil and &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;. The border between the department and Suriname, the &lt;a href=\"Maroni%20River\"&gt;Maroni River&lt;/a&gt;, flows through rain forest and is difficult for the &lt;a href=\"Gendarmerie%20Nationale%20%28France%29\"&gt;Gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"French%20Foreign%20Legion\"&gt;French Foreign Legion&lt;/a&gt; to patrol. There have been several phases launched by the French government to combat illegal gold mining in French Guiana, beginning with Operation Anaconda beginning in 2003, followed by Operation Harpie in 2008 and 2009 and Operation Harpie Reinforce in 2010. Colonel Fran\u00e7ois M\u00fcller, the commander of French Guiana's gendarmes, believes these operations have been successful. However, after each operation ends, Brazilian miners, , return. Soon after Operation Harpie Reinforce began, an altercation took place between French authorities and Brazilian miners. On 12 March 2010 a team of French soldiers and border police were attacked while returning from a successful operation, during which \"the soldiers had arrested 15 miners, confiscated three boats, and seized 617 grams of gold... currently worth about $22,317\". Garimpeiros returned to retrieve their lost loot and colleagues. The soldiers fired warning shots and rubber \"flash balls\", but the miners managed to retake one of their boats and about 500\u00a0grams of gold. \"The violent reaction by the garimpeiros can be explained by the exceptional take of 617 grams of gold, about 20 percent of the quantity seized in 2009 during the battle against &lt;a href=\"illegal%20mining\"&gt;illegal mining&lt;/a&gt;\", said Phillipe Duporge, the director of French Guiana's border police, at a press conference the next day.\nAdministrative divisions.\nFrench Guiana is divided into 2 &lt;a href=\"Arrondissements%20of%20the%20Guyane%20department\"&gt;arrondissements&lt;/a&gt; and 22 &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20the%20Guyane%20department\"&gt;communes&lt;/a&gt;:\nTransport.\nThe Transportation system in French Guiana is deficient compared to &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20France\"&gt;Metropolitan France&lt;/a&gt;, being concentrated in the coastal zone of the territory, while the inland municipalities are poorly connected and often difficult to access.\nRoad system.\nFrench Guiana has about 2,200 km of &lt;a href=\"roads\"&gt;roads&lt;/a&gt;, which are divided into:\nDespite the existence of numerous projects to upgrade and asphalt roads (such as the B\u00e9lizon road or the Apatou-Maripasoula-Sa\u00fcl axis), which are often opposed by environmental movements because of environmental fragmentation and problems for Amerindian and Maroon communities, several French Guiana municipalities (Ouanary, Camopi, Sa\u00fcl, Saint-\u00c9lie, Grand-Santi, Papa\u00efchton, Maripasoula, Apatou) still do not have road access.\nFollowing a treaty between France and Brazil signed in July 2005, the &lt;a href=\"Oyapock%20River%20Bridge\"&gt;Oyapock River Bridge&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href=\"Oyapock%20River\"&gt;Oyapock River&lt;/a&gt; was built and completed in 2011, becoming the first land crossing ever between French Guiana and the rest of the world (there exists no other bridge crossing the Oyapock River, and no bridge crossing the &lt;a href=\"Maroni%20River\"&gt;Maroni River&lt;/a&gt; marking the border with Suriname, although there is a ferry crossing to &lt;a href=\"Albina%2C%20Suriname\"&gt;Albina, Suriname&lt;/a&gt;). The bridge was officially opened on 18 March 2017, however the border post introduction on the Brazilian caused additional delays. As of 2020, it possible to drive uninterrupted from Cayenne to &lt;a href=\"Macap%C3%A1\"&gt;Macap\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the state of &lt;a href=\"Amap%C3%A1\"&gt;Amap\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; in Brazil.\nRailway system.\nAt present, French Guiana does not have a railway system, with the exception of a small section in the Centre Spatial Guyanais used for the transport of components: when the territory was a &lt;a href=\"penal%20colony\"&gt;penal colony&lt;/a&gt;, there were some railroad lines built by the &lt;a href=\"Prisoner\"&gt;Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;s themselves to connect the various baths with each other, the remains of which (now disused and mostly engulfed by the &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;) are still visible in some areas. These lines include the section from Montsin\u00e9ry-Tonnegrande to the so-called bagne des Annamites, the section from Saint-\u00c9lie to the Saut du Tigre &lt;a href=\"labor%20camp\"&gt;labor camp&lt;/a&gt; (now submerged by the artificial lake created by the Petit-Saut dam) and the section from Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni-Mana-Saint-Jean-du-Maroni.\nPorts.\nTransportation by boat is quite widespread in French Guiana: among the most important Ports are the port of D\u00e9grad-Des-Cannes, located at the mouth of the Mahury River, in the commune of R\u00e9mire-Montjoly, through which most of the imported or exported goods of the territory pass and where the local detachment of the Marine nationale is housed, and the port of Larivot, located in Matoury, where the Guyanese &lt;a href=\"fishing%20fleet\"&gt;fishing fleet&lt;/a&gt; is concentrated.\nThe port of D\u00e9grad-Des-Cannes, built in 1969 to cope with the impossibility of the former port of Cayenne to decongest the growing maritime traffic, has a rather limited draft, and larger ships often prefer to dock at Ile du Salut to unload people and goods (which are then transported to the &lt;a href=\"mainland\"&gt;mainland&lt;/a&gt; by smaller ships) to avoid running aground. The port of Pariacabo in Kourou is home to the Colibri and Toucan ships, which carry components for Ariane missiles.\nThe inland rivers are heavily traversed by canoes and other small boats, linking the villages on the Marowijne, Oyapock and Approuague Rivers, which often cannot be reached in any other way; the lake created by the Petit-Saut dam is also frequently crossed, although it is officially forbidden to cross the body of water.\nIn the department, 460 km of aquatic environment are considered navigable.\nAirports.\nFrench Guiana is served by &lt;a href=\"Cayenne%20%E2%80%93%20F%C3%A9lix%20Ebou%C3%A9%20Airport\"&gt;Cayenne \u2013 F\u00e9lix Ebou\u00e9 Airport&lt;/a&gt;, located in Matoury. There are also several &lt;a href=\"Aerodrome\"&gt;airstrips&lt;/a&gt; in the department, located in Camopi, Maripasoula, Ouanary, Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock, Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni and Sa\u00fcl, for a total of eleven hubs (four paved and seven unpaved).\nFrom the main airport, there are two daily direct flights to Paris (Paris Orly airport, with an average flight time of about 8 hours and 25 minutes from Guyana to the capital and 9 hours and 10 minutes vice versa), offered by &lt;a href=\"Air%20France\"&gt;Air France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Air%20Cara%C3%AFbes\"&gt;Air Cara\u00efbes&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other flights to &lt;a href=\"Fort-de-France\"&gt;Fort-de-France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pointe-%C3%A0-Pitre\"&gt;Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Port-au-Prince\"&gt;Port-au-Prince&lt;/a&gt;, Miami and Bel\u00e9m: The regional carrier Air Guyane Express also offers daily flights to Maripasoula and Sa\u00fcl, as well as more sporadic flights (mainly related to postal deliveries) to Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock and Camopi.\nPublic transportation.\nThere is a public bus service that currently only covers the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Cayenne\"&gt;Cayenne&lt;/a&gt; and is run by the SMTC (Syndicat Mixte de Transport en Commun, now changed to R\u00e9gie Communautaire des Transports \u2013 RCT) and consists of seven lines.\nFor connections between the coastal towns (except Montsin\u00e9ry-Tonnegrande), the \"collective cab\" (Taxis Co) method is quite widespread, which are minibuses with a capacity of about ten people that leave as soon as there is a certain number of users on board. In 2010, the general council reached an agreement with some of the operators of this service to make it at least partially public under the name of TIG (Transporte Interurbano de la Guiana), with fixed departure times and predefined stops.\nOn the main rivers (Marowijne and Oyapock), there are pirogue services (called pirogues cabs), which go both to inland centers and across the border (such as Albina in Suriname or Oiapoque in Brazil).\nMain settlements.\nPopulation figures are those recorded in the 2018 census.\nMilitary, police and security forces.\nThe commander of the French armed forces in French Guiana since July 2009 has been General Jean-Pierre Hestin. The military there is currently 1,900 strong, expected to increase enrollment in 2014\u20132015.\nAmong the military, police and security forces in French Guiana, are the following:\nCulture.\nArchitecture.\nThe local architecture is characterized by its &lt;a href=\"Guianan%20Creole\"&gt;Creole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amerindian\"&gt;Amerindian&lt;/a&gt; and Bushinenge influences. The main towns contain predominantly Creole-style architecture, with some Western-style buildings and forts. In the communes with the black maroon populations one can see houses of bushinengue styles. And the Amerindian communes are recognized for their pre-colonial type carbets. Most of these buildings were designed with local materials, such as wood from the Amazonian forests and bricks made on site. These local architectures blend with contemporary style buildings.\nFestivities.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Carnival\"&gt;Carnival&lt;/a&gt; is one of the major events in French Guiana. Considered the longest in the world, it takes place on afternoon of Sunday, between &lt;a href=\"Epiphany%20%28holiday%29\"&gt;Epiphany&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of January and &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Wednesday\"&gt;Ash Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in February or (month). Groups disguised according to the theme of the year parade around decorated floats to the rhythm of percussion and brass. The preparation of the groups starts months before the carnival. The groups parade in front of thousands of spectators who gather on the &lt;a href=\"sidewalks\"&gt;sidewalks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bleachers\"&gt;bleachers&lt;/a&gt; arranged for the occasion.\nBrazilian groups identical to those in the &lt;a href=\"Carnival%20in%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro\"&gt;Rio carnival&lt;/a&gt; are also appreciated for their rhythms and their alluring costumes. The Chinese community of Cayenne also participates in the &lt;a href=\"parade\"&gt;parade&lt;/a&gt;s, bringing its characteristic touch, &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAt the start of the evening, the &lt;a href=\"Touloulou\"&gt;Touloulou&lt;/a&gt;s, typical characters of the Guianan carnival, go to the &lt;a href=\"Nightclub\"&gt;dancings&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the famous &lt;a href=\"Masquerade%20ball%23Contemporary%20era\"&gt;par\u00e9-masked balls&lt;/a&gt;.\nCuisine.\n&lt;a href=\"Guianan%20cuisine\"&gt;Guianan cuisine&lt;/a&gt; is rich in the different cultures that mix in French Guiana. Creole restaurants rub shoulders with Chinese restaurants in large cities such as &lt;a href=\"Cayenne\"&gt;Cayenne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kourou\"&gt;Kourou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni\"&gt;Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni&lt;/a&gt;. The local culinary art originally brought together &lt;a href=\"Guianan%20Creole\"&gt;Guianan Creole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bushinengue\"&gt;Bushinengue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20South%20America\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; cuisines.\nAll of these cuisines have several ingredients in common:\nThis southern Caribbean territory has many typical dishes, such as &lt;a href=\"Awara%20broth\"&gt;Awara broth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galette%23Creole%20galette\"&gt;Creole galette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diz%C3%A9%20mil%C3%A9\"&gt;Diz\u00e9 mil\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Countess%20%28cake%29\"&gt;Countess&lt;/a&gt;, Cramanioc pudding, Kalawanng, &lt;a href=\"Couac\"&gt;Couac&lt;/a&gt; gratin and salad, Fricasse of iguana or its famous Pimentade (fish or chicken &lt;a href=\"court-bouillon\"&gt;court-bouillon&lt;/a&gt;).\nAtipas are local fishes beloved by the French Guianese often prepared with coconut milk.\nAt Easter, Guianan people eat a traditional dish called &lt;a href=\"Awara%20broth\"&gt;Awara broth&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor weddings, locals traditionally eat Colombo, which is a type of curry that has become a staple of the French Guianese cuisine.\nLiterature.\nFrench Guiana literature includes all works written by local authors or persons related to French Guiana. It is expressed both in French and in &lt;a href=\"French%20Guianese%20Creole\"&gt;Guianan Creole&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocal literature is a literature closely related to that of the &lt;a href=\"French%20West%20Indies\"&gt;French West Indies&lt;/a&gt;: especially the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Caribbean%20islands\"&gt;Caribbean islands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Martinique\"&gt;Martinique&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guadeloupe\"&gt;Guadeloupe&lt;/a&gt;. For some, it is an &lt;a href=\"Antilles\"&gt;Antillean&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Guiana%20Shield\"&gt;Guyanese&lt;/a&gt; literature in relation to the themes addressed, which are mainly related to slavery and other social problems. Thus, this literature takes several forms. First, orality, because it is a characteristic element of Guianan literature, as in many countries of Black America. In this connection, we can consider tales, &lt;a href=\"Legend\"&gt;Legend&lt;/a&gt;s, fables and, in another form, Novels.\nNineteenth century French Guiana is marked by a weak presence of writers. At that time, writers only published a few scattered poems in local Newspapers. Today, however, it is difficult to trace the writings of some French Guianan poets: Ho-A-Sim-Elosem, Munian, R. Octaville, etc. Two Guianan poets are the exception. According to Ndagano (1996), Isma\u00ffl Urbain and Fabien Flavien would be considered the first French Guianan poets. However, Alfred Par\u00e9pou is a writer who marked his era with his work Atipa (1885).\nThe period from 1900 to 1950 constitutes an important stage in local literature insofar as it gave birth to numerous writers who had a considerable impact, such as those of &lt;a href=\"N%C3%A9gritude\"&gt;Negritude&lt;/a&gt; (N\u00e9gritude). The Guianan of the 1950s and 1960s is notable for writing about the black cause. Serge Patient and Elie Stephenson did address this issue in their writings.\nSince 1970 different generations of writers have become aware of the black cause or &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;. Whether through their writings or their political activities, they take into account this painful period that had serious consequences on the local society and on the black world in general. For this &lt;a href=\"generation\"&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christiane%20Taubira\"&gt;Christiane Taubira&lt;/a&gt; remains the figurehead. Other writers are interested in other types of themes, such as regional nature, etc.\nSport.\nSport in French Guiana dates back to long before the colonial period. Popularized since the 19th century, the first sports competition organized to commemorate 14 July was held in 1890. At that time, there were already physical activities favorable to the inhabitants of this &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20rainforest\"&gt;Amazonian&lt;/a&gt; territory, but also sports coming from Europe, which favored the &lt;a href=\"Colonization\"&gt;colonizers&lt;/a&gt;. There were: foot races, donkey races, canoe races, bicycle races, tricycle races, nautical regattas in the ports and traditional popular games.\nThe most popular sport in French Guiana today is soccer, followed by basketball, cycling, swimming and handball, although there are some canoeing, judo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, aikido, karate, fencing, horseback riding, rowing and volleyball clubs in the department.\nAs a French Overseas department, Guiana is not a member of the &lt;a href=\"Pan%20American%20Sports%20Organization\"&gt;Pan American Sports Organization&lt;/a&gt;; rather, athletes compete within the &lt;a href=\"French%20National%20Olympic%20and%20Sports%20Committee\"&gt;French National Olympic and Sports Committee&lt;/a&gt; and are governed by the &lt;a href=\"Ligue%20d%27Athl%C3%A9tisme%20de%20la%20Guyane\"&gt;Ligue d'Athl\u00e9tisme de la Guyane&lt;/a&gt;, a sub-unit of the &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20fran%C3%A7aise%20d%27athl%C3%A9tisme\"&gt;F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise d'athl\u00e9tisme&lt;/a&gt;.\nStarting in 1960, the &lt;a href=\"Tour%20of%20Guiana\"&gt;Tour of Guiana&lt;/a&gt;, an annual &lt;a href=\"stage%20race\"&gt;multiple stage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bicycle%20racing\"&gt;bicycle race&lt;/a&gt;, is held.\nFootball.\nThe territory has its own local team the &lt;a href=\"French%20Guiana%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;French Guiana national football&lt;/a&gt; team. A regional football league, the French Guiana Football League, was established in October 1962. It is currently not affiliated to &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt;, but has been affiliated to the FFF since 27 April 1963 and has been an associate member of CONCACAF (North, Central American and Caribbean League) since 1978.\nDespite being geographically in the subcontinent of South America, the local sports authorities chose to participate in the competition where most of the countries and &lt;a href=\"Dependent%20territory\"&gt;dependent territories&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; area are located, and not in CONMEBOL as it would correspond to it in terms of &lt;a href=\"Geography\"&gt;Geography&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn April 2013, the LFG became a full member of CONCACAF. The French Guiana Football Team, also known as Yana D\u00f2k\u00f2, is a selection of the best local players under the auspices of the Guiana Football League. It is not recognized by FIFA, but participates in CONCACAF competitions. It played its first match against &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Guiana%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Dutch Guiana&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;) in 1936 losing 1 to 3. It had its biggest victory on 26 September 2012 against &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Pierre%20and%20Miquelon\"&gt;St. Pierre and Miquelon&lt;/a&gt; (11 to 1) and its biggest defeat was also against Dutch Guiana, losing 9 to 0 on 2 March 1947.\nThe team has participated in events such as the CONCACAF Nations Cup / &lt;a href=\"2021%20CONCACAF%20Gold%20Cup\"&gt;Gold Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caribbean%20Cup\"&gt;Caribbean Nations Cup&lt;/a&gt; (between 1978 and 2017), CONCACAF Nations League, Overseas Cup (Coupe de l'Outre-Mer, 2008\u20132012) and the Tournament of 4 (Tournoi des 4).\nTour.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tour%20of%20Guiana\"&gt;Tour of Guiana&lt;/a&gt; (locally: Tour de Guyane), formerly known as \"Le Tour du Littoral\" (the Littoral Tour) or more rarely as \"La Grande Boucle Guayanaise\", is a &lt;a href=\"road%20bicycle%20racing\"&gt;cycling&lt;/a&gt; stage race that takes place mainly in French Guiana each year, although it occasionally crosses neighbouring countries.\nIt takes place in nine stages, with a route linking the main towns of the department: Cayenne, &lt;a href=\"Kourou\"&gt;Kourou&lt;/a&gt;, and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. It was created in 1950 and is organised by the Comit\u00e9 R\u00e9gional de Cyclisme de la Guyane (French Guiana Cycling Committee).\nThe tour has been international since 1978. Over the years it has gained in importance and popularity and its duration has increased. The participation has grown from a mostly French Guianan group in the first editions to editions with more than 10 different nationalities. The 2020 edition of the Tour could not take place due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; pandemic. This is also the case for the Tour in 2021.\nIn popular culture.\nThe novel \"&lt;a href=\"Papillon%20%28book%29\"&gt;Papillon&lt;/a&gt;\", by the French convict &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Charri%C3%A8re\"&gt;Henri Charri\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;, is set in French Guiana. It was first published in France in 1969, describing his escape from a penal colony there. Becoming an instant bestseller, it was translated into English from the original French by June P. Wilson and Walter B. Michaels for a 1970 edition, and by author &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20O%27Brian\"&gt;Patrick O'Brian&lt;/a&gt;. Soon afterward the book was adapted for a Hollywood &lt;a href=\"Papillon%20%281973%20film%29\"&gt;film of the same name&lt;/a&gt;. Charri\u00e8re stated that all events in the book are truthful and accurate, allowing for minor lapses in memory. Since its publication there has been controversy over its accuracy."
