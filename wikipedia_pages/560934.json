    "title": "Glenmont station",
    "text": "Glenmont is a &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Metro\"&gt;Washington Metro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"metro%20station\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Montgomery County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maryland\"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Line%20%28Washington%20Metro%29\"&gt;Red Line&lt;/a&gt;. It is the northeastern &lt;a href=\"train%20station%23Terminus\"&gt;terminus&lt;/a&gt; of the Red Line.\nThe station, located at &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Avenue\"&gt;Georgia Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maryland%20Route%20182\"&gt;Layhill Road&lt;/a&gt;, serves the &lt;a href=\"suburb\"&gt;suburb&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Glenmont%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Glenmont&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aspen%20Hill%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Aspen Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Service began on July 25, 1998.\nHistory.\nEarly planning.\nGlenmont was planned to be the location of the end of a line in the original layout of the Metrorail system that was approved in 1968. Two months later, the Glenmont Vicinity Citizens Association and several other citizens' groups attempted to have the line end at Silver Spring instead because they did not want the added development, and they thought the extended lines would be too expensive. There were also concerns that the line would eventually be extended to &lt;a href=\"Olney%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Olney&lt;/a&gt;, which would change its rural character. The House Interior Appropriates Subcommittee was not convinced, and the plan went along unchanged. At the time, the station was planned to open in 1979.\nAs of 1970, the site for building the station was vacant land zoned for residential use and owned by Georgia Avenue Baptist Church. Safeway wanted to build a supermarket on the site, and it petitioned the county to change the site from residential to commercial zoning in 1970. Metro had not planned to purchase the land until 1975. WMATA protested, saying that rezoning would add $750,000 to the value of the land, which would increase its costs when it later needed to purchase the land. WMATA could not purchase the land at the time because engineering studies determining the exact placement of the station had not yet been completed and, regardless, it had not appropriated the funds to purchase the land yet. Metro asked Montgomery County to purchase the land to hold for its eventual use, but the county declined when WMATA could not guarantee that engineering studies would later find the site suitable for the station. Because the surrounding land was already classified as commercial and because WMATA would not need the land for the station for at least eight more years, the Montgomery County Council said it had no authority to decline the rezoning request. Days later, a deal was struck, whereas WMATA pledged to purchase the land within three years, Montgomery County would reserve the land for WMATA, and Georgia Avenue Baptist Church would not be required to pay property tax on the land.\n1977 plans.\nIn May 1977, Secretary of Transportation &lt;a href=\"Brock%20Adams\"&gt;Brock Adams&lt;/a&gt; questioned extending the Red Line to Glenmont, citing the increased costs projected after engineers determined that the bedrock required building the tracks much deeper than had been anticipated. Under pressure from the Office of Management and Budget and President Jimmy Carter's administration, Adams requested that the line be studied again to determine whether a bus, trolley, or highway would be a good alternative to extending the red line to Glenmont. Montgomery County Executive &lt;a href=\"James%20P.%20Gleason\"&gt;James P. Gleason&lt;/a&gt; responded, saying that the line had been studied extensively already, and he considered pulling all county funding from building the Metrorail system if the Glenmont extension did not go forward.\nBy June, a compromise had been reached; cost-cutting measures would be studied, but the Red Line would indeed be extended to Glenmont. The following month, Gleason decided to withhold all funding to WMATA until the Department of Transportation guaranteed in writing that the Metrorail extension to Glenmont would be built. The Montgomery County Council voted in disagreement with Gleason's decision, thinking that the action might also jeopardize the Metrorail extension to Shady Grove, but the Council did not actually have the power to force him to send the money to WMATA. Maryland Secretary of Transportation Hermann Intemann also decided to withhold state funding to WMATA until Adams guaranteed the line would be built.\nIn October, consultants suggested building Forest Glen and Wheaton stations as two small separated tubes rather than using one large cavernous design that had been used for nearly every other underground station. The consultants said that changing the design of those two stations would save $352.6 million. Glenmont station would still be built with the cavernous underground design. Gleason praised the study because it saved significant money without sacrificing the stations, and he decided to release Montgomery County's construction funding after plans surfaced for a study by region-wide task force. In February 1978, the Department of Transportation approved engineering studies of the Glenmont line extension, which suggesting it was warming to building the line after all. The study by a regionwide task force ended up approving the routing of stations on other Metrorail lines but it did not review the routing of the red line at all. In August, WMATA board members approved a Metrorail plan that included building the Glenmont extension as the latter phase of a two-phase construction schedule. WMATA released the plan to the Department of Transportation.\nDelays.\nIn July 1979, Adams released all held-up federal funding for all of Metrorail's lines. With all federal construction delays resolved, Glenmont metro station was scheduled to open in 1986. By 1982, the station's opening was rescheduled to 1991.\nIn 1984, President Reagan's administration limited the number of miles of track that could be built, effectively preventing the extending the red line from Wheaton to Glenmont. Later that year, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to lift the construction limitation. The Reagan administration continued to block federal funding, and opening of the Glenmont station was pushed back to 1994. In 1985, the Office of Management and Budget recommended halting all federal funding of construction, further jeopardizing the Glenmont extension. In 1991, Congress approved construction funding, and WMATA said the Glenmont station was scheduled to open in 1998.\nPresident Bill Clinton's administration approved funding of the Glenmont extension in 1993. WMATA broke ground on construction of the station in 1993, and workers began laying rail lines in 1996. The station opened on July 25, 1998.\nStation layout.\nGlenmont is the only station on the Red Line to feature the six-&lt;a href=\"coffer\"&gt;coffer&lt;/a&gt; arch design, which is also seen on the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Line%20%28Washington%20Metro%29\"&gt;Green Line&lt;/a&gt;. It is also unique as the only underground terminus station in the Washington Metro, and until 2006, it was also the only station in the system lit with sodium lamps. These lamps gave the station a warm orange glow and were later replaced with the mercury vapor lamps found in other underground stations. The Glenmont rail yard is located just beyond this station and has the ability to store 132 rail cars.\nThere are two street-level access points for the station, located on either side of Georgia Avenue (&lt;a href=\"Maryland%20State%20Highway%2097\"&gt;Route 97&lt;/a&gt;). Unlike older Metro stations, there are two street elevators serving the mezzanine, though there is only one elevator between the mezzanine and platform levels. Many &lt;a href=\"Metrobus%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29\"&gt;Metrobus&lt;/a&gt; routes serve the station.\nThere is a parking lot north of the station that was originally purchased by the county for the proposed Foxhall Elementary School and Layhill Junior High School, neither of which were built."
