    "text": "Hugh Gilmour (born 13 September 1974) is a former &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; international &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; player.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nGilmour played &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Heriot%27s%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;Heriots&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn moving to Spain he played for &lt;a href=\"RC%20Valencia\"&gt;RC Valencia&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe has played on the Veteran 10s circuit with Xodus Steelers.\nProfessional career.\nHe played for &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20Rugby\"&gt;Edinburgh Rugby&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational career.\nGilmour was capped once by &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, in their 1998 match against Fiji. He scored a try in the match. Despite his score Scotland lost the match and Gilmour was not selected again.\nHe recalls:\nLike all young rugby players, I had always dreamed of playing for Scotland, but my debut was certainly a very different experience to what I imagined it would be.\nI had come off a very successful Five Nations with the A team and was called on to the bench for the final match of the senior championship against England at Murrayfield.\nI didn't get a taste of the action that day but I was hopeful I would claim my cap at some point on the tour to the southern hemisphere. So when the team was revealed for the Fiji game, I was obviously thrilled to be given the nod.\nMy memories of the day of the game and the match itself are a bit hazy, but it was very hard and physical. We didn't start very well and let them into the game with some basic errors and turn-overs, which allowed them to get ahead and that really got the crowd involved. Once they were in front, it was a became very difficult game to turn around because they were successfully disrupting us.\nThey were also playing some great handling and running rugby and we found it increasingly difficult to get any control of the game. In fact, the 51-26 result shows we clearly failed to do so. It was a disappointing day, ultimately, but I still feel fortunate to have been given the opportunity to play rugby for my country.\nCoaching career.\nAfter playing, he coached the &lt;a href=\"RC%20Valencia\"&gt;RC Valencia&lt;/a&gt; side.\nOutside of rugby union.\nGilmour is a software developer. After working in Spain he returned to Scotland in 2015 and runs the software firm Gilmation."
