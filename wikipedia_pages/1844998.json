    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; (especially &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anglican\"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Methodist\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt;), an oblate is a person who is specifically dedicated to God or to God's service.\nOblates are individuals, either &lt;a href=\"laity\"&gt;laypersons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"clergy\"&gt;clergy&lt;/a&gt;, normally living in general society, who, while not &lt;a href=\"profession%20%28religious%29\"&gt;professed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"nun\"&gt;nun&lt;/a&gt;s, have individually affiliated themselves with a monastic community of their choice. They make a formal, private promise (annually renewable or for life, depending on the monastery with which they are affiliated) to follow the &lt;a href=\"monasticism\"&gt;Rule&lt;/a&gt; of the Order in their private lives as closely as their individual circumstances and prior commitments permit. Such oblates are considered an extended part of the monastic community; for example, &lt;a href=\"Benedictine\"&gt;Benedictine&lt;/a&gt; oblates also often include the post-nominal letters 'OblSB' or 'ObSB' after their names on documents. They are comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Order\"&gt;tertiaries&lt;/a&gt; associated with the various &lt;a href=\"mendicant%20order\"&gt;mendicant order&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe term \"oblate\" is also used in the official name of some &lt;a href=\"religious%20institute\"&gt;religious institute&lt;/a&gt;s as an indication of their sense of dedication.\nOrigins and history.\nThe word \"oblate\" (from the Latin \"oblatus\" - someone who has been offered) has had various particular uses at different periods in the history of the Christian church.\nThe children vowed and given by their parents to the monastic life, in houses under the &lt;a href=\"Rule%20of%20St.%20Benedict\"&gt;Rule of St. Benedict&lt;/a&gt;, were commonly known by this term during the century and a half after its writing, when the custom was in vogue, and the &lt;a href=\"Ecumenical%20council\"&gt;council&lt;/a&gt;s of the Church treated them as monks. This practice continued until the &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Council%20of%20Toledo\"&gt;Tenth Council of Toledo&lt;/a&gt; in 656 forbade their acceptance before the age of ten and granted them free permission to leave the monastery, if they wished, when they reached the age of &lt;a href=\"puberty\"&gt;puberty&lt;/a&gt;. The term \"puer oblatus\" (used after that Council) labels an \"oblate\" who had not yet reached puberty and thus had a future opportunity to leave the monastery, though \"puer oblatus\" can also refer to someone entering an abbey. At a later date the term \"oblate\" designated such lay men or women as were pensioned off by royal and other patrons upon monasteries or benefices, where they lived as in an almshouse or homes.\nIn the 11th century, Abbot &lt;a href=\"William%20of%20Hirschau\"&gt;William of Hirschau&lt;/a&gt; or Hirsau (died 1091), in the old diocese of &lt;a href=\"Speyer\"&gt;Spires&lt;/a&gt;, introduced two kinds of lay brethren into the monastery:\nAfterwards, the different status of the lay brother in the several orders of monks, and the ever-varying regulations concerning him introduced by the many reforms, destroyed the distinction between the \"conversus\" and the \"oblatus\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cassinese%20Benedictines\"&gt;Cassinese Benedictines&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, at first carefully differentiated between \"conversi\", \"commissi\" and \"oblati\"; the nature of the vows and the forms of the habits were in each case specifically distinct. The \"conversus\", the lay brother properly so called, made solemn vows like the &lt;a href=\"choir%20monk\"&gt;choir monk&lt;/a&gt;s, and wore the &lt;a href=\"scapular\"&gt;scapular&lt;/a&gt;; the \"commissus\" made simple vows, and was dressed like a monk, but without the scapular; the \"oblatus\" made a vow of obedience to the abbot, gave himself and his goods to the monastery, and wore a sober secular dress.\nBut in 1625, we find the \"conversus\" reduced below the status of the \"commissus\", inasmuch as he could make only simple vows for a year at a time; he was in fact indistinguishable, except by his dress, from the \"oblatus\" of a former century. Then, in the later Middle Ages, \"oblatus\", \"confrater\", and \"donatus\" became interchangeable titles, given to any one who, for his generosity or special service to the monastery, received the privilege of lay membership, with a share in the prayers and good works of the brethren.\nCanonically, only two distinctions ever had any consequence:\nModern practices.\nSecular oblates.\nMany Benedictine communities still retain secular oblates. These are either &lt;a href=\"clergy\"&gt;clergy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"laity\"&gt;laypeople&lt;/a&gt; affiliated in prayer with an individual monastery of their choice, who have made a formal private promise (annually renewable or for life) to follow the Rule of St. Benedict in their private life at home and at work as closely as their individual circumstances and prior commitments permit.\nIn the Roman Catholic Church the oblate is in an individual relationship with the monastic community and does not form a distinct unit within the Church, there are no regulations in the modern &lt;a href=\"Canon%20law%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;canon law&lt;/a&gt; of the Church regarding them. One consequence is that non-Catholic Christians can be received as oblates of a Catholic monastery. Similarly in Methodist monasteries, non-Methodist Christians can be received as oblates. The same is the case with many Anglican monasteries, which accept non-Anglican Christians as oblates.\nConventual oblates.\nThere is a small number of conventual or claustral oblates, who reside in a monastic community. If the person has not done so previously, after a year's probation they make a simple commitment of their lives to the monastery, which is received by the &lt;a href=\"religious%20superior\"&gt;superior&lt;/a&gt; in the presence of the whole community. More on the level of committed volunteers, they would share in the life of the community and undertake, without remuneration, any work or service required of them. They are not, however, considered monks or nuns themselves. Often they wear a &lt;a href=\"religious%20habit\"&gt;religious habit&lt;/a&gt; similar to, but distinct from, that of the monks or nuns. A conventual oblate may cancel this commitment at any time; and it is canceled automatically if the superior sends the oblate away for good reason, after simple consultation with the &lt;a href=\"Chapter%20%28religion%29\"&gt;chapter&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligious congregations that use \"oblate\" in their name.\nThere are several religious orders (\"i.e.\", living the &lt;a href=\"consecrated%20life\"&gt;consecrated life&lt;/a&gt; according to &lt;a href=\"church%20law\"&gt;church law&lt;/a&gt;) that use the word \"oblate\" in their name, or in an extended version of their common name. These are not oblates like the oblates (secular) and (regular), and should not be confused with them.\nExamples include the:"
