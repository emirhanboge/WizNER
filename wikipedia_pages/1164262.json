    "text": "The Victory Mountains () is a major group of &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Land\"&gt;Victoria Land&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antarctica\"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, about long and wide, which is bounded primarily by &lt;a href=\"Mariner%20Glacier\"&gt;Mariner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tucker%20Glacier\"&gt;Tucker&lt;/a&gt; glaciers and the &lt;a href=\"Ross%20Sea\"&gt;Ross Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The division between these mountains and the &lt;a href=\"Concord%20Mountains\"&gt;Concord Mountains&lt;/a&gt; (to the NW) is less precise but apparently lies in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Thomson%20Peak\"&gt;Thomson Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Ross Sea aspect of the mountains was first obtained by early British expeditions of &lt;a href=\"James%20Clark%20Ross\"&gt;Ross&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carstens%20Borchgrevink\"&gt;Borchgrevink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Falcon%20Scott\"&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Shackleton\"&gt;Shackleton&lt;/a&gt;. The mapping of the interior mountains was largely done from air photos taken by the U.S. Navy and surveys undertaken by &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; parties in the 1950s and 1960s. So named by the &lt;a href=\"NZGSAE\"&gt;NZGSAE&lt;/a&gt; 1957-58, because of the proximity of this group to the &lt;a href=\"Admiralty%20Mountains\"&gt;Admiralty Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and with the intention that many of the topographic features would be named for celebrated victories, especially naval victories."
