    "text": "Morton Sosland (May 7, 1925 \u2013 April 25, 2019) was an American businessman.\nSosland, grandson of Jewish emigres from Czarist Russia, was a prominent &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20metropolitan%20area\"&gt;Kansas City&lt;/a&gt; businessman who died in April 2019. Born in 1925, he began working for the Sosland Publishing Company in 1947, serving as the company's publisher and editor for several decades. A graduate of Southwest High School, Sosland entered &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; in 1942. After his first year of study, however, he left school to enlist in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt;. Sosland served in &lt;a href=\"WWII\"&gt;WWII&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"George%20S.%20Patton\"&gt;General Patton&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge\"&gt;Battle of the Bulge&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; in 1946 to complete his coursework in business and economics. After marrying Estelle Glatt, he came back to Kansas City in 1947.\nFood industry.\nSosland had a long career in the grain and food publishing business. At 22, he joined the Sosland Publishing Company, a firm specializing in &lt;a href=\"Trade%20magazine\"&gt;trade journals&lt;/a&gt; started by his father David and uncle Samuel. The company, founded in 1922, printed news and information about agricultural forecasts, &lt;a href=\"food%20trends\"&gt;food trends&lt;/a&gt;, and global &lt;a href=\"Consumer\"&gt;consumer markets&lt;/a&gt;. Sosland rose through company ranks eventually creating much of the editorial content for several of the company &lt;a href=\"magazine\"&gt;magazine&lt;/a&gt;s, including their very influential &lt;a href=\"flagship\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt;, Milling and &lt;a href=\"Baking\"&gt;Baking&lt;/a&gt; News. By the 1970s, Sosland was an internationally known &lt;a href=\"authority\"&gt;authority&lt;/a&gt; on food markets and &lt;a href=\"global%20politics\"&gt;global politics&lt;/a&gt;.\nKansas City Involvement.\nMorton and Estelle Sosland were extremely involved in the Kansas City community including support of several Jewish community organizations, as well as the &lt;a href=\"MRIGlobal\"&gt;Midwest Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"MRIGlobal\"&gt;MRI Global&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Menorah%20Medical%20Center\"&gt;Menorah Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, and especially, the &lt;a href=\"Nelson-Atkins%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. The 2009 gift of their personal collection of Native American art formed the foundation for the museum's native arts gallery. Most famously (and controversially), the Sosland's commissioned the Shuttlecocks, the now iconic oversized &lt;a href=\"badminton\"&gt;badminton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shuttlecock\"&gt;birdies&lt;/a&gt; that grace the lawn of the &lt;a href=\"Nelson-Atkins%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Nelson-Atkins&lt;/a&gt;. When first unveiled, the &lt;a href=\"sculpture\"&gt;sculpture&lt;/a&gt;s, created by artists &lt;a href=\"Claes%20Oldenburg\"&gt;Claes Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Coosje%20van%20Bruggen\"&gt;Coosje van Bruggen&lt;/a&gt;, were panned by &lt;a href=\"critic\"&gt;critic&lt;/a&gt;s. Said one local newspaper editor, the birdies are \"so offensively silly looking that they simply have to be included in any article about Kansas Citians being played as saps.\" Today, these sculptures are an important part of the visual landscape of the city.\nOf his community support, Sosland reported, \"I was brought up to feel that we all owe something to the world around us.\" In 1954, he started the Sosland Foundation serving as its president for many years. He also served on the boards of many local foundations including those \"with a considerable Kansas City presence including &lt;a href=\"H%26amp%3BR%20Block\"&gt;H&amp;R Block, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Commerce%20Bancshares\"&gt;Commerce Bancshares, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, ERC Corporation, &lt;a href=\"Hallmark%20Cards\"&gt;Hallmark Cards, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%20Southern%20Industries\"&gt;Kansas City Southern Industries&lt;/a&gt;, Stilwell Financial, Inc., and &lt;a href=\"Trans%20World%20Airlines\"&gt;Trans World Airlines&lt;/a&gt;. He also was a member of the board of Brown Shoe Co., Inc., Ingredient Technology Corp., TW Services, Inc., and Continental Grain Co.\" In recognition of his service, Sosland received numerous awards and recognition. In 1975, he was selected as \"Mr. Kansas City\" by the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce. He also received the Chancellor's Medal from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Missouri%E2%80%93Kansas%20City\"&gt;University of Missouri\u2014Kansas City&lt;/a&gt; and induction into the Academy of &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; Squires in 1987. In 2002, he received the Leader in Agriculture Award and in 2006, he was in the first class of the Baking Hall of Fame.\nIn the UK Morton and Estelle Sosland maintained a home in &lt;a href=\"Sussex\"&gt;Sussex&lt;/a&gt; for many years, and supported diverse charities including &lt;a href=\"Glyndebourne\"&gt;Glyndebourne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//issuu.com/glyndebourne/docs/gly_f16_season_bro_singles_07\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and also helped the &lt;a href=\"British%20Museum\"&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt; acquire nearly 200 works &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx%3FsearchText%3Dsosland%26amp%3Bpage%3D2\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nOf Sosland's noted importance to his home community, one leader remarked that, \"We are humbled by what he accomplished in his many decades as a civic leader and how he raised the level of what Kansas City is.\""
