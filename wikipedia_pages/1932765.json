    "text": "The blood banana (\"Musa acuminata\" var. \"zebrina\"), is a &lt;a href=\"variety%20%28botany%29\"&gt;variety&lt;/a&gt; of the wild banana \"&lt;a href=\"Musa%20acuminata\"&gt;Musa acuminata&lt;/a&gt;\" native to &lt;a href=\"Sumatra\"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. The blood banana is an &lt;a href=\"ornamental%20plant\"&gt;ornamental plant&lt;/a&gt;, named for the dark red patches on its leaves, though its small-seeded fruits are also edible. It grows 6' to 8' tall in the wild, but is well-adapted to container growing and can be maintained at 3' to 5'. It grows best in full or partial sun and is hardy in zones 9 - 11. \nTaxonomy and nomenclature.\nThe blood banana is a variety of the wild banana species \"Musa acuminata\", one of the two ancestors of modern edible bananas. It was once classified as separate species under the now invalid names (&lt;a href=\"Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29%23Botany\"&gt;synonyms&lt;/a&gt;) \"Musa zebrina\" and \"Musa sumatrana\". It was also sometimes incorrectly classified as a cultivar. The variety is not accepted by some sources, including the &lt;a href=\"World%20Checklist%20of%20Selected%20Plant%20Families\"&gt;World Checklist of Selected Plant Families&lt;/a&gt;, which regards it as part of the nominate subspecies of \"Musa acuminata\", \"M.\u00a0acuminata\" subsp. \"acuminata\".\nThe blood banana is also known as the red banana tree, though it should not be confused with the &lt;a href=\"red%20banana\"&gt;red banana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cultivar\"&gt;cultivar&lt;/a&gt;. Other &lt;a href=\"common%20name\"&gt;common name&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; include seeded red banana, Sumatra ornamental banana, and maroon-variegated banana plant. They are also known as in &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20language\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, () in &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20language\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt;, () in &lt;a href=\"Thai%20language\"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Vietnamese%20language\"&gt;Vietnamese&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nBlood bananas are characterized by dark red patches of variable sizes on their dark green leaves. Their &lt;a href=\"pseudostem\"&gt;pseudostem&lt;/a&gt;s are characteristically very slender. They bear small, slender fruits filled with grape-like seeds.\nDistribution.\nBlood bananas are native to &lt;a href=\"Java\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. They are notable for being one of the earliest banana subspecies to be spread by humans out of &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;. Introduced eastward to &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, they became the ancestors for the genetically distinct and commercially important &lt;a href=\"East%20African%20Highland%20bananas\"&gt;East African Highland bananas&lt;/a&gt; (Mutika/Lujugira subgroup of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20banana%20cultivars%23AAA\"&gt;AAA&lt;/a&gt; group).\nIt is probably the only seeded banana to ever be introduced into &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; before European contact. It is known as the in &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20language\"&gt;Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt;, though the name is also applied to the species \"&lt;a href=\"Musa%20balbisiana\"&gt;Musa balbisiana&lt;/a&gt;\", which was introduced later on."
