    "text": "\"&lt;a href=\"Candidatus\"&gt;Candidatus&lt;/a&gt;\" Scalindua wagneri is a &lt;a href=\"Gram-negative\"&gt;Gram-negative&lt;/a&gt; coccoid-shaped bacterium that was first isolated from a wastewater treatment plant. This bacterium is an obligate &lt;a href=\"anaerobic%20organism\"&gt;anaerobic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chemolithotroph\"&gt;chemolithotroph&lt;/a&gt; that undergoes anaerobic ammonium oxidation (&lt;a href=\"anammox\"&gt;anammox&lt;/a&gt;). It can be used in the wastewater treatment industry in nitrogen reactors to remove nitrogenous wastes from wastewater without contributing to fixed nitrogen loss and &lt;a href=\"greenhouse%20gas%20emissions\"&gt;greenhouse gas emission&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacterization.\n\"Candidatus\" Scalindua wagneri is a &lt;a href=\"coccus\"&gt;coccoid&lt;/a&gt;-shaped bacterium with a diameter of 1 \u03bcm. Like other &lt;a href=\"Planctomycetes\"&gt;Planctomycetes&lt;/a&gt;, S. wagneri is &lt;a href=\"Gram-negative\"&gt;Gram-negative&lt;/a&gt; and does not have &lt;a href=\"peptidoglycan\"&gt;peptidoglycan&lt;/a&gt; in its &lt;a href=\"cell%20wall\"&gt;cell wall&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the bacterium contains two inner membranes instead of having one inner membrane and one outer membrane that surrounds the cell wall. Some of the near neighbors are other species within the new Scalindua genus, such as \"Candidatus\" S. sorokinii and \"Candidatus\" S. brodae. Other neighbors include \"Candidatus\" Kuenenia stuttgartiensis and \"Candidatus\" &lt;a href=\"Brocadia%20anammoxidans\"&gt;Brocadia anammoxidans&lt;/a&gt;. S. wagneri and its genus share only about 85% similarity with other members in its evolutionary line, which suggests that it is distantly related to other anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (anammox) bacteria.\nDiscovery.\nMarkus Schmid from the Strous lab first discovered S. wagneri in a landfill &lt;a href=\"leachate\"&gt;leachate&lt;/a&gt; treatment plant located in &lt;a href=\"Pitsea\"&gt;Pitsea&lt;/a&gt;, UK on August 1, 2001. These bacteria doubled in number about every three weeks in laboratory conditions, which made them very difficult to isolate. Therefore, the researchers used 16S &lt;a href=\"rRNA\"&gt;rRNA&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"ribosomal%20RNA\"&gt;ribosomal RNA&lt;/a&gt;) gene analysis on the &lt;a href=\"biofilm\"&gt;biofilm&lt;/a&gt; of wastewater samples to detect the presence of these bacteria. They amplified and isolated the 16S rRNA gene from the biofilm using &lt;a href=\"PCR\"&gt;PCR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gel%20electrophoresis\"&gt;gel electrophoresis&lt;/a&gt;. Then, they &lt;a href=\"TOPO%20cloning\"&gt;cloned&lt;/a&gt; the DNA into TOPO &lt;a href=\"Cloning%20vector\"&gt;vectors&lt;/a&gt;. Once the researchers sequenced the DNA, they aligned the 16S rRNA gene sequences to a &lt;a href=\"genome\"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt; database and found that the sequences are related to the anammox bacteria. One of the sequences showed a 93% similarity to \"Candidatus\" Scalindua sorokinii, which suggests that this sequence belonged to a new species within the genus Scalindua and the researchers named it \"Candidatus\" Scalindua wagneri after Michael Wagner, a microbial &lt;a href=\"ecologist\"&gt;ecologist&lt;/a&gt;.\nMetabolism.\nS. wagneri is an obligate &lt;a href=\"anaerobic%20organism\"&gt;anaerobic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chemolithoautotroph\"&gt;chemolithoautotroph&lt;/a&gt; and undergoes &lt;a href=\"anaerobic%20ammonium%20oxidation\"&gt;anaerobic ammonium oxidation&lt;/a&gt; (anammox) in the intracytoplasmic compartment called an &lt;a href=\"anammox\"&gt;anammox&lt;/a&gt;osome. During the anammox process, &lt;a href=\"ammonium\"&gt;ammonium&lt;/a&gt; is oxidized using &lt;a href=\"nitrite\"&gt;nitrite&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"electron%20acceptor\"&gt;electron acceptor&lt;/a&gt; and forms &lt;a href=\"dinitrogen\"&gt;dinitrogen&lt;/a&gt; gas as a product. It is proposed that this mechanism occurs through the production of a &lt;a href=\"hydrazine\"&gt;hydrazine&lt;/a&gt; intermediate using &lt;a href=\"hydroxylamine\"&gt;hydroxylamine&lt;/a&gt;, which is derived from nitrite. In addition, S. wagneri uses nitrite as an &lt;a href=\"electron%20donor\"&gt;electron donor&lt;/a&gt; to fix &lt;a href=\"carbon%20dioxide\"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; and forms &lt;a href=\"nitrate\"&gt;nitrate&lt;/a&gt; as a byproduct. To the test the &lt;a href=\"metabolic\"&gt;metabolic&lt;/a&gt; properties of S. wagneri, Nakajima \"et al\". performed anammox activity tests using nitrogen compounds labeled with the 15&lt;a href=\"Isotopes%20of%20nitrogen%23Nitrogen-15\"&gt;N isotopes&lt;/a&gt; and measured 28N2, 29N2, and 30N2 concentrations after 15 days. The researchers found that the concentrations of the 28N2 and 29N2 gases increased significantly. These results suggest that ammonia and nitrite is used in equal amounts to make 29N2, and &lt;a href=\"denitrification\"&gt;denitrification&lt;/a&gt; concurrently occurs with anammox metabolism.\nGenome.\nCurrently, genomic information about S. wagneri is very limited. Current genome sequences were collected from DNA isolated from the bacteria growing in a marine anammox bacteria (MAB) reactor. Then, the 16S rRNA genes on the DNA were amplified using a specific &lt;a href=\"oligonucleotide\"&gt;oligonucleotide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Primer%20%28molecular%20biology%29\"&gt;primer&lt;/a&gt; for \"Planctomycetales\", separated using gel electrophoresis, and sequenced using a CEQ 2000 DNA Sequencer. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences was performed using the GENETYX program, and the alignments and phylogenetic trees were made using &lt;a href=\"BLAST\"&gt;BLAST&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clustal\"&gt;CLUSTALW&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"neighbor%20joining\"&gt;neighbor joining&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. To have a better understanding of the &lt;a href=\"genome\"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt;, S. wagneri can be compared to one of its better-known relatives. For example, \"Candidatus\" Scalindua profunda has a genome length of 5.14 million base pairs with a &lt;a href=\"GC%20content\"&gt;GC content&lt;/a&gt; of 39.1%. There is no genomic information about the length or % GC content for S. wagneri. However, there are hundreds of 476 base pair partial sequences for its 16S rRNA gene. Using &lt;a href=\"fluorescent%20in%20situ%20hybridization\"&gt;fluorescent in situ hybridization&lt;/a&gt; (FISH) analysis, a technique used to detect specific DNA sequences on &lt;a href=\"chromosomes\"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;, researchers were not able to detect hybridization between the chromosome of S. wagneri and the putative anammox DNA probe. This suggests that S. wagneri is not very similar to the known anammox bacteria, so the researchers categorized the bacterium into its own genus.\nEcology.\nAlthough researchers are unable to isolate pure &lt;a href=\"cultures\"&gt;cultures&lt;/a&gt; of S. wagneri, it is believed to encompass a broad &lt;a href=\"Ecological%20niche\"&gt;niche&lt;/a&gt;. Using 16S rRNA gene analysis, Schmid first found evidence of the bacteria in wastewater treatment plants. Other researchers also found 16S rRNA gene evidence in a petroleum reservoir held at a temperature range between 55\u00a0\u00b0C and 75\u00a0\u00b0C in addition to &lt;a href=\"freshwater\"&gt;freshwater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marine%20biology\"&gt;marine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ecosystems\"&gt;ecosystems&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"estuaries\"&gt;estuaries&lt;/a&gt;.\nImportance and useful applications.\nS. wagneri allows wastewater treatment plants to reduce operation costs while reducing the adverse effects of &lt;a href=\"nitrification\"&gt;nitrification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"denitrification\"&gt;denitrification&lt;/a&gt; on the environment. These bacteria contribute to the development of new technologies for wastewater management by aiding in the efficient removal of &lt;a href=\"Nitrogen%23Dinitrogen%20complexes\"&gt;nitrogenous compounds&lt;/a&gt; in wastewater. Usually, nitrogen reactors use both nitrification and denitrification to remove nitrogenous wastes. These processes have high operation costs due to the continuous maintenance of &lt;a href=\"aerobic%20organism\"&gt;aerobic&lt;/a&gt; conditions in the reactor. Denitrification also produces &lt;a href=\"nitrous%20oxide\"&gt;nitrous oxide&lt;/a&gt; (N2O), which is a greenhouse gas that is detrimental to the environment. Production of N2O contributes to the loss of fixed nitrogen, which regulates the biological &lt;a href=\"productivity\"&gt;productivity&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ecosystems\"&gt;ecosystems&lt;/a&gt;. By inoculating wastewater reactors with the &lt;a href=\"anaerobic%20organism\"&gt;anaerobic&lt;/a&gt; S. wagneri, operation costs can be reduced by about ninety percent without the production of greenhouse gases. This allows for better wastewater management in a more cost-efficient manner without contributing to &lt;a href=\"climate%20change\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;."
