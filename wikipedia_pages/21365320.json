He is fluent in &lt;a href=\"Gujarati%20language\"&gt;Gujarati&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1990s, Desai appeared on the &lt;a href=\"WRAL-TV\"&gt;WRAL-TV&lt;/a&gt; (NC Triangle) television children's show, \"CentralXpress.com\", and played the character \"Raj\". The show won multiple awards, including seven regional &lt;a href=\"Emmy\"&gt;Emmy&lt;/a&gt;s, two national Iris awards, and a national &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Award\"&gt;Gabriel Award&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesai attended &lt;a href=\"Carnage%20Middle%20School\"&gt;Carnage Middle School&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20Hill-Carrboro%20City%20Schools\"&gt;Phillips Middle School&lt;/a&gt;, then later went on to attend &lt;a href=\"East%20Chapel%20Hill%20High%20School\"&gt;East Chapel Hill High School&lt;/a&gt;, graduating in 2004. During his time at East Chapel Hill High School, he was a member of the all-male a cappella group, the Chiefs of Staff. He was awarded a four-year academic merit scholarship to attend the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill\"&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and was the Haywood W. Hinkle Carolina scholar from 2004 to 2008.\nAfter being accepted and planning to attend college at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill\"&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, Desai auditioned for and was accepted as a member of the &lt;a href=\"UNC%20Clef%20Hangers\"&gt;UNC Clef Hangers&lt;/a&gt;, a long-standing male &lt;a href=\"a%20cappella\"&gt;a cappella&lt;/a&gt; group founded in 1977. He was accepted in the group as a senior in high school with the understanding that he would begin attending the University in the fall of 2004. Desai served as the group's music director during his junior year and as the group's president his senior year. Desai\u2019s performance as a soloist on the song \u201cShe Has No Time\u201d was recognized with the BOCA 2007 (Best of College A Cappella).\nDesai graduated from UNC in 2008 with a bachelor of arts degree, with a double major of political science and American studies. He was awarded the 2008 Peter C. Baxter Memorial Prize in American Studies, as one who exemplified \"intellectual excellence, personal warmth and creativity.\"\n\"American Idol\".\nOverview.\nDesai rose to national fame with his participation in the &lt;a href=\"American%20Idol%20%28season%208%29\"&gt;eighth season&lt;/a&gt; of \"American Idol\". Motivated by the death of his friend &lt;a href=\"Murder%20of%20Eve%20Carson\"&gt;Eve Carson&lt;/a&gt;, Desai auditioned for \"American Idol\" on August 8, 2008 in &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Kansas City, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, and was selected as a semifinalist following his \"Hollywood Week\" performances., Although he was not one of the three finalists chosen out of his semifinal performance group, he returned as a \"Wild Card.\" The judges saved Desai for last on Wild Card night and after announcing that &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Giraud\"&gt;Matt Giraud&lt;/a&gt; had made the Top 12, Simon Cowell then revealed the twist of Season 8: that Desai would also move onto the finals, leading to the first ever Top 13 in Idol history.\nDesai's first finals performance of &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Jackson\"&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Beat%20It\"&gt;Beat It&lt;/a&gt;\" was panned by the judges, with &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Cowell\"&gt;Simon Cowell&lt;/a&gt; saying that it was \"very lightweight\" and that he regretted choosing Desai for the Top 13. But Desai won the judges over again the next week, when he sang &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Nelson\"&gt;Willie Nelson&lt;/a&gt;'s classic country ballad \"&lt;a href=\"Always%20On%20My%20Mind\"&gt;Always On My Mind&lt;/a&gt;\" for \"&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ole%20Opry\"&gt;Grand Ole Opry&lt;/a&gt; Week.\" Even Cowell was impressed, and retracted his remarks about Desai not deserving to be in the Top 13. Desai's rendition of &lt;a href=\"Cyndi%20Lauper\"&gt;Cyndi Lauper&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"True%20Colors%20%28Cyndi%20Lauper%20song%29\"&gt;True Colors&lt;/a&gt;\" three weeks later, which also garnered praise from the judges, prompted Cowell to compare the contestant to a \"yo-yo\", going back and forth between good and weak performances.\nNonetheless, Desai landed in the Bottom Two that week, just as he had the previous week. He finished in the Bottom Three during Top 7 week, when Matt Giraud was saved from elimination by the judges. This meant the next week would be a double elimination, wherein Desai ended up being voted off along with &lt;a href=\"Lil%20Rounds\"&gt;Lil Rounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nCelebrities such as &lt;a href=\"Ellen%20DeGeneres\"&gt;Ellen DeGeneres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Urban\"&gt;Keith Urban&lt;/a&gt; said they favored Desai to win.\nDesai returned for the &lt;a href=\"American%20Idol%20%28season%208%29%23Finale\"&gt;season finale&lt;/a&gt; of \"Idol\"'s Season 8 to perform \"&lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Yours%20%28Jason%20Mraz%20song%29\"&gt;I'm Yours&lt;/a&gt;\" with fellow \"Idol\" contestant Alexis Grace and singer &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Mraz\"&gt;Jason Mraz&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-\"Idol\".\nSince appearing on \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Idol\"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt;\", Desai has appeared on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20Show\"&gt;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Live%20with%20Regis%20and%20Kelly\"&gt;Live with Regis and Kelly&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mo%27Nique%20Show\"&gt;The Mo'Nique Show&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Access%20Hollywood\"&gt;Access Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Today%20%28NBC%20program%29\"&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;\", and local radio stations across the nation. He has also performed with &lt;a href=\"Amos%20Lee\"&gt;Amos Lee&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. Desai also performed on the &lt;a href=\"American%20Idols%20LIVE%21%20Tour%202009\"&gt;American Idols LIVE! Tour 2009&lt;/a&gt; with his fellow Top 10 contestants; the tour visited 50 cities in the United States and &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; from July 5 to September 15, 2009.\nDesai's first single, titled \"My Name,\" was co-written by Brandon Rogers and Desai, and was released on March 23, 2010.
