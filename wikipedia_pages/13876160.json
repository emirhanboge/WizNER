At the time of his appointment the club were struggling financially, but he was credited with turning the situation around through his use of the player transfer market to buy and sell players for a profit. He left \"The Pirates\" (a nickname that he introduced, along with the team's blue and white quartered shirts, which are still worn today) in 1936. He then spent two years working as a full-time boxing promoter, before being appointed as manager of &lt;a href=\"Gloucester%20City%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Gloucester City&lt;/a&gt; in 1938, at which point he was one of the best-known sporting figures in the West of England.\nHe died in late 1967, aged 77, in &lt;a href=\"Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;."
