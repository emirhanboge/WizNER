    "text": "\"Tonight I Climbed the Wall\" is a song written and performed by American &lt;a href=\"country%20music\"&gt;country music&lt;/a&gt; artist &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Jackson\"&gt;Alan Jackson&lt;/a&gt;. It was released in January 1993 as the second single from his album \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Lot%20About%20Livin%27%20%28And%20a%20Little%20%27bout%20Love%29\"&gt;A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love)&lt;/a&gt;\". It peaked at number 4 on both the United States \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart and the Canadian \"RPM\" Country Tracks chart. This broke a string of ten consecutive singles by Jackson that had peaked in the top 3 of Billboard's Hot Country chart.\nContent.\nThe song discusses a couple that had been fighting. They had built a wall between them with all of the arguing and now the man in the song climbed that wall. He put all the disagreements behind them and went to his wife. After he made the climb and admitted his faults, he realized the things they were fighting over were small and unimportant.\nMusic video.\nThe music video was directed by Jim Shea, is entirely in black and white, and premiered in early 1993. It switches between scenes of Alan performing live and a woman walking around on a farm. This is one of only twice when Jackson appears without his trademark mustache, the second time being in the music video for \"&lt;a href=\"So%20You%20Don%27t%20Have%20to%20Love%20Me%20Anymore\"&gt;So You Don't Have to Love Me Anymore&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2012.\nChart positions.\n\"Tonight I Climbed the Wall\" debuted at number 73 on the &lt;a href=\"Hot%20Country%20Songs\"&gt;Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks&lt;/a&gt; chart for the week of February 6, 1993."
