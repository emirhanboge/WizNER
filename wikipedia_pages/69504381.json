    "text": "LiveWire is an American electric motorcycle manufacturer. It was initially launched as a dedicated electric vehicle (EV) division for &lt;a href=\"Harley%20Davidson\"&gt;Harley Davidson&lt;/a&gt; in July 2021. In December 2021, the news was published that LiveWire would be spun-off from parent Harley Davidson, set to go public in the first half of 2022 as a &lt;a href=\"special%20purpose%20acquisition%20company%20\"&gt;special purpose acquisition company &lt;/a&gt; (SPAC) valued at $1.77 billion. It will reportedly be the first publicly traded electric motorcycle company in the United States.\nThe company operates dual headquarters at &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Palo%20Alto%2C%20California\"&gt;Palo Alto, California&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe LiveWire electric motorcycle was first displayed to the media in June 2014, as part of Harley Davidson's Project LiveWire Experience, a traveling dealer demo. Prototypes were made available for public test rides at US Harley-Davidson dealerships later in 2014, then Europe and Canada in 2015.\nIn May 2021, Harley Davidson announced it was spinning LiveWire off as its own brand, including replacing the Harley Davidson logo on the motorcycles with the LiveWire logo. The first LiveWire branded motorcycle, named LiveWire ONE, was unveiled at the July 8 International Motorcycle Show in &lt;a href=\"Sonoma%2C%20California\"&gt;Sonoma, California&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn December 2022, Harley Davidson announced it was merging LiveWire with AEA-Bridges Impact Corp. (ABIC), a SPAC formed by private equity executives John Garcia and Michele Giddens, and it would begin publicly trading on the NYSE with ticker symbol \"LVW\". The deal was reportedly financed by $400 million of ABIC\u2019s cash held in trust, $100 million from Harley-Davidson, and $100 million from Taiwanese scooter manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Kymco\"&gt;Kymco&lt;/a&gt;, through a &lt;a href=\"private%20investment%20in%20public%20equity\"&gt;private investment in public equity&lt;/a&gt; (PIPE) sale.\nProducts.\nLiveWire manufactures the LiveWire brand of motorcycles. Its first product is the LiveWire ONE electric motorcycle. Electric motorcycles are seen as easier and quieter to ride than gas-powered motorcycles, with no clutch or gearshift, or hot exhaust pipes.\nThe company reportedly planned to develop three more electric models with a goal of manufacturing 100,000 motorcycles by 2026.\nOperations.\nThe company operates dual headquarters at &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin\"&gt;Milwaukee, Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Palo%20Alto%2C%20California\"&gt;Palo Alto, California&lt;/a&gt;. Its motorcycles are manufactured in York, Pennsylvania at Harley Davidson's plant. The company reportedly plans to continue to work with Harley Davidson dealers, and is also reportedly planning dedicated LiveWire showrooms, starting in California.\nAs of January 2022, Harley Davidson Chairman and CEO &lt;a href=\"Jochen%20Zeitz\"&gt;Jochen Zeitz&lt;/a&gt; serves as LiveWire's acting CEO, and Ryan Morrissey serves as the company's President."
