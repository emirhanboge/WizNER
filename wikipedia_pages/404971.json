    "text": "The USS \"Tunny\" (SS/SSG/APSS/LPSS-282) was a which saw service in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;. \"Tunny\" received nine &lt;a href=\"battle%20star\"&gt;battle star&lt;/a&gt;s and two &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Unit%20Citation%20%28US%29\"&gt;Presidential Unit Citation&lt;/a&gt;s for her World War II service and five battle stars for her operations during the Vietnam War.\nConstruction.\n\"Tunny\" was the first submarine of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; to be named for the tunny, any of several oceanic fishes resembling the &lt;a href=\"mackerel\"&gt;mackerel&lt;/a&gt;, and her keel was laid down on 10 November 1941 at &lt;a href=\"Vallejo%2C%20California\"&gt;Vallejo, California&lt;/a&gt;, by the &lt;a href=\"Mare%20Island%20Navy%20Yard\"&gt;Mare Island Navy Yard&lt;/a&gt;. She was &lt;a href=\"ship%20naming%20and%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 30 June 1942 sponsored by Mrs. Frederick G. Crisp, wife of Rear Admiral Frederick G. Crisp, Manager of the Mare Island Navy Yard, and &lt;a href=\"ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 1 September 1942 with Lieutenant Commander Elton Watters Grenfell in command.\nWorld War II patrols.\nFirst war patrol (12 January \u2013 20 February 1943).\nFollowing shakedown training out of &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; ports, \"Tunny\" arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20Islands\"&gt;Hawaiian Islands&lt;/a&gt; on 12 December 1942. After an additional week of training and two weeks of availability, she got underway from Submarine Base, &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, on 12 January 1943 for her first war patrol. For nearly a week, rough seas hampered the progress of the submarine. Then, as she approached the &lt;a href=\"Ryukyu%20Islands\"&gt;Ryukyu Islands&lt;/a&gt;, sea traffic increased. Sightings of &lt;a href=\"sampan\"&gt;sampan&lt;/a&gt;s became frequent, and \"Tunny\" often dove to avoid detection by suspicious-looking trawlers.\nAt 05:30 on 26 January, \"Tunny\" sighted masts and a stack over the horizon indicating a possible target. During the day, she lessened the distance between herself and her quarry; and, near dusk, she closed a 400-ton trawler. Finding the prey not worth a &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;, the submarine surfaced and opened fire with her deck gun. Soon, darkness forced her to discontinue the attack, and she continued on her way.\nOn 29 January, she began patrolling off &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Formosa&lt;/a&gt;. An hour and a half before midnight on 31 January, her periscope at last disclosed a worthwhile target, a freighter approaching &lt;a href=\"Takao%20Ko\"&gt;Takao Ko&lt;/a&gt;. \"Tunny\" fired two \"fish\" from her bow tubes, but the freighter made a radical change of course which enabled her to evade the torpedoes. When her target counterattacked and dropped two &lt;a href=\"depth%20charge\"&gt;depth charge&lt;/a&gt;s, \"Tunny\" broke off the attack and submerged.\nOn 1 February, \"Tunny\" set her course for the China coast, running on the surface. As darkness fell on 2 February, she was only hours from &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, expecting to make landfall on &lt;a href=\"Tamkan%20Island\"&gt;Tamkan Island&lt;/a&gt; by daybreak. At 2130, she made &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; contact; and, through the night, drew closer to her as yet unseen quarry.\nA light rain was falling and visibility was poor when, half an hour before morning twilight, \"Tunny\" began a &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; approach. Rapidly shoaling water less than 20\u00a0fathoms (37\u00a0m) deep and land masses on two sides of the submarine limited her maneuverability. At , the extreme phosphorescence of the water illuminated her wake and betrayed her presence to the enemy ship, which began signaling the unidentified intruder with a blinker light. Despite her detection, \"Tunny\" continued the approach until she was only from the target and then launched three torpedoes. The Japanese ship, now discernible as a loaded tanker, began to maneuver radically and opened fire on the submarine. Undeterred, \"Tunny\" submerged and continued the attack, firing a second volley from her stern tubes. One of these torpedoes hit the side of the tanker with a thud, but without explosion, and a small column of water erupted just forward of the tanker's bridge. Duds and prematures were a problem for American submarines early in 1943, and verification that this torpedo had indeed hit the tanker, but failed to detonate, was forthcoming when members of the tanker's crew dashed to the spot in question and began examining the impact area with flashlights. Despite continuous fire from the ship and the proximity of land, \"Tunny\" managed to stay within firing range of her target by traveling at full speed. After the tanker successfully evaded \"Tunny\"'s third salvo, the submarine fired a last torpedo from as the intended victim reached the passage into Hong Kong. Following this disappointing conclusion to her attack, \"Tunny\" dove in anticipation of search planes which appeared within two hours and continued their surveillance throughout the day.\nAfter dark on 3 February, while patrolling &lt;a href=\"Lema%20Channel\"&gt;Lema Channel&lt;/a&gt;, \"Tunny\" made &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; contact with a sizable target. On this very dark night, visual identification was impossible; but, at 2005, the submarine approached to and made a three-torpedo attack. The sound of the target's screws ceased immediately, and \"Tunny\" claimed to have sunk this unidentified ship which had been seen only on &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;. When the submarine surfaced at daybreak the following day, the submariners discovered an unexpected visitor on deck\u2014a six-foot black and yellow striped snake.\nOn 4 February, \"Tunny\" set her course for &lt;a href=\"Shantou\"&gt;Swatow&lt;/a&gt;, keeping to the shoreline in hopes of intercepting shipping. En route, she passed a large hospital ship well marked and brilliantly lighted. On 6 February and 7 February, \"Tunny\" patrolled off Swatow. Numerous &lt;a href=\"junk%20%28ship%29\"&gt;junk&lt;/a&gt;s plying the Formosa and Swatow banks at all hours added to the hazards imposed by shallow water, and an inoperable fathometer (depthmeter) made it impossible for \"Tunny\" to approach the shore closer than six miles (10\u00a0km).\nEarly on the morning of 8 February, she went deep to avoid a plane revealed by &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;. When she surfaced, she discovered a freighter off her beam. She shadowed the target during the day and, after sunset, made her approach and launched two torpedoes from a distance of . Due to bad runs, neither of these took effect, but they did alert the freighter, which opened fire on \"Tunny\". The submarine fired two shots from her bow tubes, but one torpedo missed, and the other circled around to the right. \"Tunny\" then drew ahead for a surface approach and fired three more torpedoes. Two of these found the mark; but one put on an amazing show, veering sharply first to the left and then to the right, before hitting the target. The \"&lt;a href=\"Kusayama%20Maru\"&gt;Kusayama Maru&lt;/a&gt;\", a heavily laden, 5000-ton cargo ship, sank by the stern in 20\u00a0minutes; \"Tunny\" had scored her first confirmed kill. As she proceeded on towards &lt;a href=\"Kaohsiung\"&gt;Takao&lt;/a&gt; harbor, a searchlight suddenly pierced the dark not far ahead, and \"Tunny\" dove to avoid detection.\nThe next day, \"Tunny\" sighted a large transport. Undetected by two nearby patrol vessels and a plane, she made her approach and scored two hits on the transport with her remaining torpedoes. However, the ship did not sink and later left the area.\nOn 11 February, \"Tunny\" set her course for &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt;. En route, she used a combination of 20\u00a0millimeter and five-inch (127\u00a0mm) gunfire to sink a 100-ton fishing trawler. On 20 February, she made contact with the harbor escort and proceeded to moor at &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt;, completing her first aggressive and successful patrol. She later continued on to &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, arriving at &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on 24 February 1943.\nSecond war patrol (24 March \u2013 23 April 1943).\nAfter refitting by tender and three days of training, \"Tunny\" departed the &lt;a href=\"Hawaiian%20Islands\"&gt;Hawaiian Islands&lt;/a&gt; on 18 March, paused at &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt; for replacement of her periscope, and got underway for &lt;a href=\"Wake%20Island\"&gt;Wake Island&lt;/a&gt; on 24 March. Later, Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, would describe \"Tunny\"'s second war patrol as belonging \"in that exceptional category of one of the outstandingly aggressive patrols of the war.\"\nOn 27 March 1943, \"Tunny\" arrived off &lt;a href=\"Wake%20Island\"&gt;Wake Island&lt;/a&gt; and operated within a circle all day, flooding down the decks awash when within of the island. Before dawn the next morning, she closed to within ten miles (16\u00a0km) of the Japanese-held island and watched as its awakening occupants turned on their lights. A motor torpedo boat and two patrol boats passed by less than from the submarine without detecting her presence. Trailing these vessels, \"Tunny\" came upon a cargo ship, \"&lt;a href=\"Suwa%20Maru\"&gt;Suwa Maru&lt;/a&gt;,\" and all hands scrambled to battle stations. Shortly after sunrise, the submarine launched her attack, firing two torpedoes from a range of . The first found its mark and blew the stern off the enemy ship, but the buoyancy of the lightly loaded vessel kept it afloat. \"Tunny\" was maneuvering at &lt;a href=\"periscope%20depth\"&gt;periscope depth&lt;/a&gt; to avoid depth charges dropped across her bow at a range of when the first of several aerial bombs fell close aboard. The submarine dove to . When she attempted to surface an hour later, \"Tunny\" was again driven down by an aerial adversary. Later in the morning, traveling submerged at , she set her course for her assigned patrol area.\nOn 31 March, she entered the patrol area in the &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20Islands\"&gt;Caroline Islands&lt;/a&gt;, and, on 1 April 1943, she conducted submerged patrols off &lt;a href=\"North%20Pass%20Island\"&gt;North Pass Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chuuk%20Lagoon\"&gt;Truk&lt;/a&gt;, and later in the day on the Japanese naval base's western approaches. Failing to find any action in these areas, she surfaced late in the afternoon on 2 April and set her course for the channel between &lt;a href=\"Puluwat%20Island\"&gt;Puluwat Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pulap%20Island\"&gt;Pulap Island&lt;/a&gt;. Later that day, as she patrolled off &lt;a href=\"Alet%20Island\"&gt;Alet Island&lt;/a&gt;, \"Tunny\" made &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; contact with a ship dead ahead. Heading in for a flank attack, she sighted a astern of her chosen target. \"Tunny\" launched three torpedoes from and noted a hit in the forward hold of the Japanese cargo ship before diving to to avoid the attention of the &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;. Minutes later, a series of nine depth charges tumbled down in search of the submarine, but exploded at too shallow a depth to achieve their purpose. Some 15\u00a0minutes later, as \"Tunny\" started up to take a look, she was jolted by a deep-set depth charge which caught her at , but caused only minor damage\u2014a small price to pay for the sinking of \"Toyo Maru Number\u00a02\". Before midnight, the destroyer gave up the search, and the submarine surfaced and set her course for the &lt;a href=\"Namonuito%20Atoll\"&gt;Namonuito&lt;/a&gt; group to the north.\nLate on 4 April, \"Tunny\" headed west to intercept traffic reported north of &lt;a href=\"McLaughlin%20Bank\"&gt;McLaughlin Bank&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 April, while patrolling in that area, the submarine took advantage of a rain squall to approach within of a &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;-tracked target. She then launched two torpedoes at the \"Kosei\u00a0Maru\", an 8000-ton passenger-cargo ship, scoring a hit amidships and one aft, and dove immediately to escape the inevitable wrath of the escorting &lt;a href=\"Akatsuki-class%20destroyer%20%281931%29\"&gt;\"Akatsuki\"-class destroyer&lt;/a&gt; which had been patrolling just ahead of the now-stricken transport. The ensuing depth charge counterattack continued until the destroyer lost contact with the submarine in a heavy rain squall. Having added a third cargo ship to her list of kills, \"Tunny\" retired from the scene of the attack.\nOn 8 April, the submarine surfaced in a downpour to continue patrols north of &lt;a href=\"West%20Fayu\"&gt;West Fayu&lt;/a&gt; Island. Later that day, she set her course to intercept a convoy reported to be southwest of &lt;a href=\"Chuuk%20Lagoon\"&gt;Truk&lt;/a&gt;. At 22:28 on 9 April, she made &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; contact with a formation less than three miles (5\u00a0km) distant and went to four engines to maneuver into position for an attack. In a few minutes, the formation changed course, putting \"Tunny\" in position to slow down to two-thirds speed and head in, flooded down to decks awash to avoid detection. As the convoy became visible, \"Tunny\"s commanding officer, Commander James A. Scott, could hardly believe his luck. On the starboard bow was a large &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;, to port two auxiliary carriers, and on each bow of the formation, a &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;. Given this perfect setup, \"Tunny\" maneuvered to swing the bow on twin targets, but her plans were disrupted when three small boats similar to motor torpedo boats appeared only off her port bow. \"Tunny\" quickly dove to , turned right, ninety degrees, and launched four torpedoes from her stern tubes at one of the auxiliary carriers from a distance of . As she turned her attention to other targets, four torpedo explosions sounded through the night.\nSignaling from her new target gave executive officer Lieutenant Commander Roger Keithly at the conn a final check on the target's bearing, and \"Tunny\" released a salvo of six torpedoes from her bow tubes at the large carrier. Her surprise attack completed, \"Tunny\" immediately dove amidst the cacophony of depth charges and churning screws. The depth charges rocked the submarine but did no damage; and the crackling and grinding noises heard throughout the ship, as well as on &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt;, led those on board the submarine to believe that their \"fish\" had found their mark. In all this noise and confusion, \"Tunny\" unobtrusively slipped away to the north. Later, examination of Japanese records showed that this attack was ruined by prematures and duds, and that damage to the enemy had been minor. However, the skill and daring with which the raid was conducted remained an example of excellence and prompted the Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, to commend \"Tunny\"'s commander for his actions on this patrol as \"an illustrious example of professional competence and military aggressiveness.\"\nAn hour and a half after midnight on 10 April, the submarine surfaced and set her course to return to her patrol area. While approaching North Pass about out of Truk on 11 April, \"Tunny\" dove when a searchlight suddenly broke the night, ahead on the starboard bow. No depth charges followed, and the source of the light\u2014not sizable enough to be detected on &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was presumed to be a small boat.\nEarly on the afternoon of 11 April, a contact, at first thought to be a patrol boat, turned out to be a Japanese submarine. The designation symbol of the enemy submarine was emblazoned on her sail, spelling out &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20submarine%20I-9\"&gt;\"I-9\"&lt;/a&gt; in large white characters. Boldly taking the offensive, \"Tunny\" fired her three remaining forward \"fish\" at the submarine, only to see the vessel turn away and parallel the course of the torpedoes. \"Tunny\" then began her own evasive procedures, going deep and away from the Japanese submersible\u2014and none too soon. Minutes later, she tracked two torpedoes which passed harmlessly astern. An enemy plane added bombs to \"Tunny\"'s immediate concerns, but she rigged for &lt;a href=\"Silent%20running%20%28submarine%29\"&gt;silent running&lt;/a&gt; and weathered the attack by remaining submerged until after nightfall.\nThat same evening, as \"Tunny\" lay on the surface in the bright moonlight charging her batteries, she made &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; contact with a ship moving at . Within minutes, the contact materialized into an enemy destroyer steaming on the starboard bow. \"Tunny\" dove to and began to swing for a stern shot when the belligerent destroyer increased speed to a thundering and headed in from a distance of less than . As the submarine dove for , the explosions of nine depth charges fairly close by pursued her. Silent running and a quick reversal of course eventually shook off the menacing destroyer, and \"Tunny\" returned to the surface after the moon set, noting only minor damage from the attack.\nIn the days that followed, \"Tunny\" patrolled off &lt;a href=\"East%20Fayu%20Island\"&gt;East Fayu Island&lt;/a&gt; and north of &lt;a href=\"Mogami%20Bank\"&gt;Mogami Bank&lt;/a&gt; before setting her course for &lt;a href=\"Saipan\"&gt;Saipan&lt;/a&gt; on 15 April. Her surveillance of &lt;a href=\"Magicienne%20Harbor\"&gt;Magicienne Harbor&lt;/a&gt; disclosed that it was not in use. Seeking targets, the submarine passed through &lt;a href=\"Saipan%20Channel\"&gt;Saipan Channel&lt;/a&gt; and later discovered two cargo ships in &lt;a href=\"Garapan%20Harbor\"&gt;Garapan Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Prevented from attacking by the presence of intervening reefs, \"Tunny\" departed the area and moored in the lagoon at &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt; on 23 April for a welcome rest. So aggressive had been her handling on this eventful patrol that not one of her firing ranges exceeded . She was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Unit%20Citation%20%28US%29\"&gt;Presidential Unit Citation&lt;/a&gt; for this outstanding patrol.\nThird war patrol (27 April \u2013 14 July 1943).\nAfter refitting at &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt;, \"Tunny\" continued on to &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; for additional repairs. She departed &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on 25 May 1943 and, after fueling at &lt;a href=\"Johnston%20Island\"&gt;Johnston Island&lt;/a&gt;, got underway on 27 April for &lt;a href=\"Eniwetok\"&gt;Eniwetok&lt;/a&gt;. Her first contact with the enemy on this third war patrol came early in the afternoon on 31 May when she dove to avoid a &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; contact whose speed identified it as a plane. As \"Tunny\" passed , a bomb exploded over her after torpedo room breaking lights and thermometers, flooding the after &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s, and causing miscellaneous other damage. An unsatisfactory makeshift repair of the broken bridge speaker prompted a note in the war patrol report that \"the only dependable communication system was the open hatch and a powerful set of lungs.\" Other repairs were completed before nightfall, and \"Tunny\" continued on her way. She patrolled off &lt;a href=\"Eniwetok\"&gt;Eniwetok&lt;/a&gt; for two days; then moved on to her assigned area, arriving at &lt;a href=\"Chuuk%20Lagoon\"&gt;Truk&lt;/a&gt; on 6 June.\nAs this patrol progressed, \"Tunny\" discovered that antisubmarine action by the Japanese at Truk had shifted to aerial detection. On 7 June, her first day of patrol, she was harassed by a single float biplane and an ineffectual Japanese destroyer. \"Tunny\" found the enemy biplanes a great nuisance, since her &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; detected them late or not at all. Soon she came to regard the aircraft as an arch-enemy which thwarted attacks on convoys by hovering overhead and guiding possible targets around the submarine, out of firing range.\nOn 14 June, as \"Tunny\" cruised on the surface following a submerged patrol east of &lt;a href=\"Murilo%20Island\"&gt;Murilo Island&lt;/a&gt; in the Hall group, one of her lookouts sighted a convoy bearing 090 degrees. Made up of two small freighters and a large transport and accompanied by two destroyers, the convoy was a tempting target. As \"Tunny\" made her approach, an unobserved escort vessel suddenly challenged her with a searchlight and several rounds of four-inch (102\u00a0mm) fire which fell astern. The submarine dove to but continued her approach. She then surfaced and launched four torpedoes at the transport from a range of . Three explosions and a tremendous cloud of smoke and water over the target indicated that \"Tunny\" had damaged the enemy vessel. The submarine dove to avoid the escorts, but no depth charging ensued. Shortly after midnight, as she ran on the surface attempting to intercept the convoy, an undetected vessel fired shots which splashed astern. \"Tunny\" dove again.\nAs June wore on, \"Tunny\" continued patrols as far as &lt;a href=\"Saipan\"&gt;Saipan&lt;/a&gt; without success. On 26 June, she conducted routine and photographic reconnaissance of &lt;a href=\"Saipan%20Harbor\"&gt;Saipan Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tinian%20Channel\"&gt;Tinian Channel&lt;/a&gt; and, later that day, surfaced to patrol the Truk-Empire shipping lanes east of &lt;a href=\"Rota%20Island\"&gt;Rota Island&lt;/a&gt;. Patrolling off &lt;a href=\"Harnum%20Point\"&gt;Harnum Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rota%20harbor\"&gt;Rota harbor&lt;/a&gt; on 28 June, \"Tunny\" sighted a converted gunboat zigzagging madly, went to battle stations, and dispatched the enemy vessel with a salvo of three torpedoes from . Sighting an &lt;a href=\"Naval%20trawler\"&gt;armed trawler&lt;/a&gt; bearing down on her, the submarine dove. Those on board felt the concussion of three sharp explosions close aboard, perhaps from aerial bombs, as \"Tunny\" went deep and rigged for silent running, maneuvering to avoid the trawler. Seconds later, two heavy explosions marked the death throes of \"Tunny\"'s most recent victim. \"Tunny\" was chased down again by the trawler when she attempted to surface an hour later. Returning to periscope depth some three hours after the attack, her commanding officer at the periscope was relieved to find no sign of the trawler, but his relief quickly turned to alarm when the periscope revealed a close-up of the bomb bay of a &lt;a href=\"Mitsubishi%20Ki-21\"&gt;Mitsubishi Type 97&lt;/a&gt; at , directly overhead. This time \"Tunny\" waited four hours before surfacing again from &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe patrolled off Guam until 4 July when she received orders to leave the area. Early the next day, she set her course for &lt;a href=\"Johnston%20Island\"&gt;Johnston Island&lt;/a&gt;. Japanese aircraft continued to badger the submarine for two days as she proceeded toward Hawaii. After taking on fuel and provisions at Johnston Island on 11 July, she completed her third patrol at Pearl Harbor on 14 July.\nFourth war patrol (10 August \u2013 8 September 1943).\nAfter refitting and three days of training, \"Tunny\" departed &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; on 5 August for &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt;. She arrived at &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt; on 9 August and was again underway on 10 August. On 18 August, she sighted &lt;a href=\"Pagan%20Island\"&gt;Pagan Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alamagan%20Island\"&gt;Alamagan Island&lt;/a&gt;; and, on 22 August, she entered her assigned area in the &lt;a href=\"Palau%20Islands\"&gt;Palau Islands&lt;/a&gt; and began patrols. Early in the morning of 24 August, she sighted a six-ship convoy as it emerged from &lt;a href=\"Toagel%20Mlungui%20Pass\"&gt;Toagel Mlungui Pass&lt;/a&gt;. \"Tunny\" trailed the convoy until she could obtain a good firing position and, at moonrise on 25 August, she submerged to and began her approach. At 01:40, she launched three torpedoes and then another two in rapid succession. She then ducked her periscope and dove to avoid being rammed by the first target. The convoy passed overhead as \"Tunny\" dove deep in expectation of depth charges. She heard her torpedoes explode at the end of their run, but the absence of depth charges was both welcome and unexpected. Near dawn, \"Tunny\" made another attack, launching six torpedoes at ships of the convoy without success. Meanwhile, a destroyer escort had joined the convoy. Alerted to \"Tunny\"'s presence, she now bore down on the submarine. \"Tunny\" dove, and, for the next two hours, the enemy ship remained overhead pinging and tracking. The destroyer escort dropped two patterns of six depth charges close by the submarine but finally gave up the search. At noon, \"Tunny\" came to periscope depth and, finding no sign of the convoy, set her course for &lt;a href=\"Toagel%20Mlungui\"&gt;Toagel Mlungui&lt;/a&gt;, securing from battle stations after an exhausting 15 hours.\nAt mid-morning on 26 August, she spotted two vessels escorted by &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20submarine%20chaser%20CH-4\"&gt;submarine chaser CH-4&lt;/a&gt; approaching &lt;a href=\"Toagel%20Mlungui%20Pass\"&gt;Toagel Mlungui Pass&lt;/a&gt; and launched a five-torpedo attack. As \"Tunny\" dove, the screws of the first ship were heard to stop; and, shortly thereafter, two depth charges exploded overhead. Two minutes later, another pattern of depth charges exploded all around the submarine. A small fire broke out in the maneuvering room, causing main power to be lost momentarily. In order to check the fire, the main motors were stopped for one minute; then started again. Although the fire was small, dense smoke from burning insulating varnish made it difficult at first to assess the damage. Meanwhile, \"Tunny\"'s bow planes jammed and the submarine climbed to , then went into a steep glide which took her down to before control was regained. Within five minutes, coolly efficient damage control parties had restored operating conditions to nearly normal, and the submarine began her retirement to the southwest. Once again the sound of screws caused tense moments for those on board \"Tunny\", but this time no depth charges fell.\nEarly that evening, \"Tunny\" surfaced and headed away from the heavily traveled lanes she had been patrolling in order to assess her damages and effect repairs. Inspection disclosed considerable damage to the bow, ripped-up plating aft of the torpedo room, and sheared-off rivets and bolts. The torpedo room pressure hull was badly dished in between frames; and this damage in turn immobilized the bow plane tilting gears. The explosions had jammed the gyro spindles in the stern torpedo tubes, impaired the usefulness of sound and &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; gear, and caused other damage visible throughout the ship. Sailors inspecting topside found fragments of the destructive depth charges scattered over the deck.\nFor two days, her crew labored to restore her to order and make the necessary repairs. Having done everything within his means to restore \"Tunny\" to normal operating condition, her commanding officer found her still short of combat readiness. Her bow planes, despite all efforts, were still inoperative; her bow buoyancy tank unusable; and various other problems, which could not be remedied at sea, remained. Thus, on 29 August 1943, she departed her patrol area leaving these hunting grounds to other submarines in better condition. The war-scarred submarine moored at &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on 8 September.\nFifth war patrol (27 February \u2013 11 April 1944).\nAfter a preliminary assessment of battle damage, \"Tunny\" departed &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on 11 September 1943. She arrived at &lt;a href=\"Hunters%20Point%2C%20San%20Francisco%2C%20California\"&gt;Hunters Point, San Francisco, California&lt;/a&gt; on 17 September for overhaul and repairs and remained there until 2 February 1944. Then, repairs and tests completed, she departed the West Coast. \"Tunny\" returned to &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; a week later, underwent voyage repairs and training, and departed &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; for her fifth war patrol on 27 February.\nShe stopped at &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt; on 2 March, got underway the next day for the &lt;a href=\"Palau%20Islands\"&gt;Palau Islands&lt;/a&gt;, and entered her patrol area on 15 March. On 20 March, a persistent observation plane kept \"Tunny\" down for three hours off the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Toagel%20Mlungui\"&gt;Toagel Mlungui&lt;/a&gt; and dropped eight light bombs without damaging the submarine. In the following days, the submarine patrolled the northern and western approaches to the islands.\nOn 22 March, \"Tunny\"s &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; picked up what proved to be a large convoy. Day was breaking, and \"Tunny\" was maneuvering for a position ahead when an escorting destroyer appeared on the &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; at . The enemy soon sighted the submarine and challenged her with a blinker. \"Tunny\" took advantage of a nearby rain squall for concealment and continued to close the convoy, keeping a watchful eye on the destroyer. Despite bad visibility and the pinging of the escort, \"Tunny\" continued her approach and soon found herself in the midst of a group of tankers and cargo ships. Choosing two heavily loaded cargo ships for her targets, she launched a six-torpedo attack and heard or observed hits on both. Immediately, attention on board \"Tunny\" was diverted when a small tanker nearly collided with the submarine. \"Tunny\" now obtained a setup on a destroyer moving at high speed across her stern, fired four Mark\u00a018 torpedoes, then dove quickly even as depth charges from a nearby trawler exploded on the port quarter. During the next four hours, the Japanese ships dropped 87 depth charges in an effort to finish off the submarine but without effect. Late in the day, \"Tunny\" surfaced and began a futile search for stragglers and cripples from the morning's attack. She found only debris and an oil slick.\nAt 21:19 on 23 March, while patrolling off &lt;a href=\"Angaur%20Island\"&gt;Angaur Island&lt;/a&gt;, \"Tunny\" picked up a &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; contact which she identified by sight as a large &lt;a href=\"Type%20B%20submarine\"&gt;I-class submarine&lt;/a&gt;. For nearly an hour and a half, \"Tunny\" and the enemy submarine maneuvered for position, each attempting to prevent the other from obtaining a shot. Then, at 2324, \"Tunny\" launched four torpedoes from a range of , swung hard to starboard to prevent a collision, and dove to avoid a possible return attack. Before the hatch was closed, two hits were heard and felt and a flash was seen inside \"Tunny\"'s &lt;a href=\"conning%20tower\"&gt;conning tower&lt;/a&gt;. For one terrible moment, observers on board \"Tunny\" feared that their own submarine had been hit. As \"Tunny\" dove to and began circling the area, the screws of the enemy submarine stopped, and a crackling racket began and continued for an hour. When the noise ceased, \"Tunny\" surfaced and cleared the area, but had met her end.\n\"Tunny\" returned to waters off &lt;a href=\"Toagel%20Mlungui\"&gt;Toagel Mlungui&lt;/a&gt; and resumed patrols. On the morning of 29 March, she observed a large number of small vessels leaving &lt;a href=\"Malakal%20Harbor\"&gt;Malakal Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, none worth an attack. Apparently, the enemy had somehow received word of the Fifth Fleet's impending bombing attack on Japanese installations in the &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20Islands\"&gt;Caroline Islands&lt;/a&gt; and made a desperate attempt to clear the area. Late in the afternoon, a larger formation appeared: the 63,000-ton &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20battleship%20Musashi\"&gt;battleship \"Musashi\"&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"light%20cruiser\"&gt;light cruiser&lt;/a&gt; , and three &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, also fleeing the expected aerial bombardment. After a daring approach, \"Tunny\" fired six torpedoes at the battleship from her bow tubes. The torpedoes passed directly under an alert destroyer of the screen which immediately hoisted flags to warn the battleship, swung parallel to the torpedo tracks, and made a run on the submarine. \"Tunny\" went deep and ran for the southwest while the destroyer dropped 38 depth charges in a short, but concentrated counterattack. One torpedo had found its mark on the battleship's bow, which caused flooding of the &lt;a href=\"hydrophone\"&gt;hydrophone&lt;/a&gt; compartment and 18 casualties. Toward sunset, the submarine lost contact with the formation. Later that night, she encountered what she thought to be the same force and was held down for two hours by one of the escorting ships. Hits by two of \"Tunny\"s torpedoes had damaged but failed to slow the powerful battleship. However, \"Musashi\" was still forced to return to port for repairs and upgrades, which kept her out of action for most of April.\nAt 02:00 on 30 March, \"Tunny\" arrived on station to begin lifeguard duties for the Fifth Fleet's air attack on the &lt;a href=\"Palau%20Islands\"&gt;Palau Islands&lt;/a&gt;. At 07:00, a series of explosions followed by the appearance of heavy smoke from the vicinity of the harbor indicated that American planes were finding their mark. During the morning, more than 100 planes passed over the submarine on their return from the strike. Then, as \"Tunny\" circled on station shortly after noon, two American torpedo bombers approached. One sheared off for a strafing attack which was not completed; the other went into a steep glide and released a bomb from an altitude of . Incredulous watchers on the submarine saw the bomb cross over the deck gun on the bow, pass the bridge at what appeared to be no more than arm's length, and strike the water with a tremendous impact, only ten yards to starboard of the forward engine room. The entire ship lifted with a snap as if it had collided with an underwater object, and an explosion followed some seconds later, throwing personnel and gear in all directions in the maneuvering and after torpedo rooms. Damage to the main control cubicle and to \"Tunny\"'s remaining torpedoes resulted. \"Tunny\" completed repairs during the night, and the next morning manned her lifeguard station as before, only a little more wary of \"friendly\" aircraft.\n\"Tunny\" departed the &lt;a href=\"Palau%20Islands\"&gt;Palau Islands&lt;/a&gt; on 2 April, stopped at &lt;a href=\"Milne%20Bay\"&gt;Milne Bay&lt;/a&gt; on 7 April, and arrived in Australia on 11 April. She received the Presidential Unit Citation for this patrol.\nSixth war patrol (29 April \u2013 29 June 1944).\nFollowing refit, the submarine departed &lt;a href=\"Brisbane\"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; on 29 April and set her course for &lt;a href=\"New%20Guinea\"&gt;New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;. She underwent voyage repairs at &lt;a href=\"Milne%20Bay\"&gt;Milne Bay&lt;/a&gt;, then proceeded via &lt;a href=\"Langemak%20Bay\"&gt;Langemak Bay&lt;/a&gt; to her patrol area in the &lt;a href=\"Mariana%20Islands\"&gt;Mariana Islands&lt;/a&gt;. She arrived in the patrol area on 11 May and, in the days that followed, encountered many enemy planes as she patrolled off &lt;a href=\"Saipan\"&gt;Saipan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 17 May, she received a report from submarine of a convoy in the area and set out to intercept it. Late in the afternoon, she sighted the smoke of her quarry; and, just after sunset, the masts came into view. The convoy consisted of three cargo ships escorted by a like number of destroyers. Racing against fading twilight, \"Tunny\" made her approach; launched a spread of three torpedoes at the second ship of the column; then rapidly fired three more at the last cargo ship. Before the converging escorts forced her down, \"Tunny\" observed that a hit had left the last ship of the column down by the stern, emitting clouds of dense black smoke. Although the escorting vessels dropped 81 depth charges, none fell close, and \"Tunny\" withdrew to the southeast, having scored her sixth kill of the war, a 4900-ton cargo ship, the \"Nichiwa\u00a0Maru\". Shortly after midnight, \"Tunny\" surfaced and saw an ill-fated cargo ship, the victim of \"Sand Lance\", ablaze from stem to stern. Frequent minor explosions punctuated the night as the ship went down in the darkness.\nAs \"Tunny\" continued patrols in the &lt;a href=\"Mariana%20Islands\"&gt;Mariana Islands&lt;/a&gt;, she sighted numerous aircraft and noted explosions and burning ships\u2014apparently the work of sister ship . At this time, however, planes attached to enemy convoys seemed effective in detecting \"Tunny\" and routing convoys around her, out of range of her torpedoes.\nOn 8 June, she rendezvoused with submarines and to form a coordinated attack group, the \"Blair Blasters.\" The three submarines formed a scouting line for a patrol across the western Pacific to the &lt;a href=\"South%20China%20Sea\"&gt;South China Sea&lt;/a&gt;. \"Tunny\" passed through &lt;a href=\"Balintang%20Channel\"&gt;Balintang Channel&lt;/a&gt; on 14 June and sighted &lt;a href=\"Luzon\"&gt;Luzon&lt;/a&gt; the next morning. While returning through &lt;a href=\"Balintang%20Channel\"&gt;Balintang Channel&lt;/a&gt; on 16 June, she made a surface approach on a small &lt;a href=\"sampan\"&gt;sampan&lt;/a&gt; and sank it with gunfire. She conducted patrols in the &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Sea\"&gt;Philippine Sea&lt;/a&gt; until 22 June when she parted company with the attack group. On 29 June, she fueled at &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt;; then proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Oahu\"&gt;Oahu&lt;/a&gt;, having traveled over on her sixth war patrol.\nSeventh war patrol (4 August \u2013 17 September 1944).\nAfter refitting, she departed &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on 4 August 1944 as a member of a &lt;a href=\"Wolfpack%20%28naval%20tactic%29\"&gt;coordinated attack group&lt;/a&gt; or \"wolfpack\" called \"Ed's Eradicators\". With wolfpack members and , she set her course, via &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt;, for the &lt;a href=\"South%20China%20Sea\"&gt;South China Sea&lt;/a&gt;. She arrived in her patrol area on 25 August. Her first action came hours after midnight on 31 August when the wolfpack attacked a convoy. \"Queenfish\" was the first to score a hit, and \"Tunny\" witnessed the explosion of a tanker, the victim of her sister submarine. As \"Tunny\" maneuvered in the bright moonlight, she was suddenly startled by gunfire, which seemed to those on board to come from all directions. She dove and avoided damage from the depth charges which soon followed. Later on the same day, a hit by \"Barb\" alerted the convoy's air escort to \"Tunny\"'s presence; and she was forced down again without opportunity to launch her torpedoes. Time after time, the submarine surfaced only to be forced down by escorting planes as the attack on the convoy continued into the evening.\nA second disappointing day came on the heels of the first. \"Tunny\" patrolled submerged for most of 1 September in order to avoid enemy aircraft. Late in the afternoon, she was advancing westward on a scouting line formed by the wolf pack, when she sighted a plane dead ahead and about six miles (10\u00a0km) distant. She immediately began to dive, but 90 seconds later, as she passed , two bombs hit close aboard aft, sending the ship upward at an eight degree angle and causing extensive damage. As the third and fourth bomb exploded, \"Tunny\" was already heading for to assess her damages.\nInspection disclosed that the bombs had dished in the hull plating in the vicinity of the after torpedo room and the maneuvering room, causing a leak in a vent riser. Less than ten minutes after the Japanese plane had been sighted, the commanding officer decided to discontinue the patrol. Throughout the ship, sheared off valves and bolts, damaged meters, clocks, and gauges attested to the force of the bomb's explosion. In addition, all three &lt;a href=\"antenna%20%28radio%29\"&gt;radio antennas&lt;/a&gt; were down, a leak in her pressure hull had been aggravated, and \"Tunny\"'s rudder action indicated possible damage. She set her course for &lt;a href=\"Balintang%20Channel\"&gt;Balintang Channel&lt;/a&gt; and surfaced late in the day on 2 September. \"Tunny\" continued to sight Japanese airplanes as she made her way to Hawaii. She completed this patrol on 17 September at &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nEighth war patrol (3 February \u2013 14 April 1945).\n\"Tunny\" departed &lt;a href=\"Oahu\"&gt;Oahu&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; on 20 September and on 26 September she arrived at &lt;a href=\"Hunters%20Point%20Naval%20Shipyard\"&gt;Hunter's Point&lt;/a&gt; for battle damage repairs and an overhaul. She returned to &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; in January 1945 and, after a training period departed &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on 3 February for her eighth war patrol.\nOn 14 February, she entered &lt;a href=\"Tanapag%20Harbor\"&gt;Tanapag Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and moored to submarine tender for repairs to her main engine. Later in the month, she conducted &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt; tests out of that port. On 5 March, she departed &lt;a href=\"Saipan\"&gt;Saipan&lt;/a&gt; and, in the days that followed, was slowed by heavy seas as she proceeded to her patrol area in the &lt;a href=\"Ryukyu%20Islands\"&gt;Ryukyu Islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 13 March and 14 March, she conducted a special reconnaissance mission off the &lt;a href=\"Nansei%20Shoto\"&gt;Nansei Shoto&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for landings planned for &lt;a href=\"Okinawa\"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April. On 14 March, \"Tunny\" plotted over 230 mines which she detected on &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt; as she traveled through the hazardous waters at . On 15 March, all hands breathed a sigh of relief as \"Tunny\" got underway for her patrol area, her special mission safely and successfully completed.\nHer pursuit of a distant convoy ended in disappointment on 18 March, when a change of course allowed the cargo ships and their escort to slip away from \"Tunny\" around sunset. For two days, the submarine patrolled off &lt;a href=\"Amami%20%C5%8Cshima\"&gt;Amami \u014cshima&lt;/a&gt;; then, on 23 March, she took up a lifeguard station. Days later, as \"Tunny\" searched for a downed flier, a twin-float enemy plane took her by surprise and dropped two bombs. One fell quite close but caused only minor damage to the submarine. As the month drew to its close, \"Tunny\" rescued two fliers from &lt;a href=\"aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt; and one from as those ships took part in the assault on &lt;a href=\"Okinawa\"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 1 April, \"Tunny\" completed her lifeguard duties and set her course for &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt;. En route, she sank a 200-ton lugger with her deck gun. After stopping at &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt;, she arrived at &lt;a href=\"Oahu\"&gt;Oahu&lt;/a&gt; on 14 April.\nNinth (last) war patrol (14 May \u2013 6 July 1945).\nFollowing refitting and a week of &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt; and approach training, \"Tunny\" departed &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on 14 May for her ninth war patrol. She stopped at &lt;a href=\"Guam\"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt; for repairs and additional &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt; exercises, then got underway on 28 May. Together with submarines and , \"Tunny\" formed the second group of \"Hydeman's Hellcats\" known as \"Pierce's Polecats.\" On 2 June, \"Tunny\" passed through the &lt;a href=\"Nansei%20Shoto\"&gt;Nansei Shoto&lt;/a&gt; and, as she approached &lt;a href=\"Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB\"&gt;Ky\u016bsh\u016b&lt;/a&gt; two days later, encountered increasing small boat traffic. On 5 June, \"Tunny\" passed through &lt;a href=\"Korea%20Strait\"&gt;Korea Strait&lt;/a&gt;, repeating the hair-raising task of mine detection by &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt;, this time in &lt;a href=\"Nishi%20Suido\"&gt;Nishi Suido&lt;/a&gt;. She plotted over 80 mines; then continued on to conduct patrols on the western shore of &lt;a href=\"Honsh%C5%AB\"&gt;Honsh\u016b&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperating in the supposedly inviolable waters of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Sea of Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the wolf pack attacked shipping and made exploratory attempts to enter Japanese harbors. Late on 9 June, \"Tunny\" attacked a cargo vessel. One torpedo hit the enemy vessel with a thud but failed to explode, and \"Tunny\" discontinued the attack. In the harbor entering phase of the patrol, \"Tunny\" closed the breakwater of &lt;a href=\"Etomo%20Ko\"&gt;Etomo Ko&lt;/a&gt; to 8,000\u00a0yards (7.3\u00a0km) shortly before midnight on 12 June. Town and waterfront lights provided illumination, but no suitable target could be found, and the submarine cleared the harbor before midnight. A few minutes later, \"Tunny\" approached within of the harbor mouth at &lt;a href=\"Uppuri%20Wan\"&gt;Uppuri Wan&lt;/a&gt; but discreetly withdrew when searchlights located and then brilliantly illuminated the intruder.\nOn 16 June, \"Tunny\" sighted numerous rafts filled with the Japanese survivors of a successful action by \"Bonefish\" and later took prisoner a Japanese chief petty officer who had escaped from the sinking ship. On the following day, as \"Tunny\" and \"Bonefish\" closed a &lt;a href=\"radar\"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt;-located target, \"Tunny\" suddenly found herself the object of gunfire, with the closest shot falling only off her port beam. She quickly changed course and eluded both the gunfire and the depth charges which followed. On 19 June, shallow coastal water foiled \"Tunny\"'s attack on a 4,000-ton cargo ship.\n\"Tunny\" rendezvoused with \"Skate\" on 23 June to depart the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Sea of Japan&lt;/a&gt;. She remained off &lt;a href=\"Hokkaid%C5%8D\"&gt;Hokkaid\u014d&lt;/a&gt; for two days on the chance that she might be able to aid \"Bonefish\", missing since her request to make a daylight submerged patrol of &lt;a href=\"Toyama%20Wan\"&gt;Toyama Wan&lt;/a&gt; some days earlier. On 27 June, \"Tunny\" discontinued her vigil; proceeded via the &lt;a href=\"Kuril%20Islands\"&gt;Kuril Islands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Midway%20Island\"&gt;Midway Island&lt;/a&gt;; and arrived at &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on 6 July.\nThe submarine then made her way back to the west coast. \"Tunny\" was decommissioned on 13 December 1945 and placed in the Mare Island Group, 19th Fleet.\nPost-war missile testing and deterrent patrols.\n&lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; aggression in &lt;a href=\"Korean%20War\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt; placed new demands on the resources of the Navy and led to \"Tunnys being placed in commission, in reserve, on 28 February 1952. She saw no service at this time, however, and was decommissioned in April 1952. On 6 March 1953, she was placed in commission for the third time. Converted to carry guided missiles under project &lt;a href=\"Ship%20Characteristics%20Board\"&gt;SCB 28&lt;/a&gt;, she was reclassified as SSG-282\"' and was armed with the &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20missile\"&gt;Regulus I&lt;/a&gt; nuclear &lt;a href=\"submarine-launched%20cruise%20missile\"&gt;cruise missile&lt;/a&gt; for nearly 12 years. In this role, \"Tunny\" was equipped with a hangar housing two missiles and a launcher on the after deck. One of the limitations of Regulus was that the firing submarine had to surface, the missile then being rolled out onto the launcher and fired. Regulus I also required guidance from submarines or other platforms after firing. In 1955, a second World War II submarine, , was also converted to fire Regulus I.\nFor the first four of those years she operated out of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Hueneme\"&gt;Port Hueneme&lt;/a&gt;, contributing to the development of the Regulus missile system. Except for a short period of type training, \"Tunny\" engaged entirely in the launching and guidance of Regulus missiles for purposes of missile evaluation in the development of the system. In 1957, she shifted her base of operations to &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Station%20Pearl%20Harbor\"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, bringing Regulus to &lt;a href=\"initial%20operational%20capability\"&gt;initial operational capability&lt;/a&gt;, where she conducted the first submarine &lt;a href=\"deterrence%20theory\"&gt;deterrent&lt;/a&gt; patrols and fired exercise missiles.\nVietnam operations.\nIn May 1965, the Regulus missile system was phased out, having been superseded by the &lt;a href=\"Polaris%20missile\"&gt;Polaris missile&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Tunny\" was redesignated with &lt;a href=\"hull%20classification%20symbol\"&gt;hull classification symbol&lt;/a&gt; SS-282. She remained in the Hawaiian operating area until the end of the year, conducting training exercises and providing various other services. In 1966, she was converted to a troop-carrying submarine and redesignated with hull classification symbol APSS-282, being re-equipped with a deck shelter for small amphibious vehicles and other equipment. In February 1967, \"Tunny\" began missions in unconventional warfare, operating off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;. She conducted reconnaissance in preparation for amphibious assault operations and gathered navigational and oceanographic information. Ideally suited for transporting small teams for specialized operations as well as for gathering information, she participated in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Deckhouse%20VI\"&gt;Operation Deckhouse VI&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 1 January 1968, the veteran submarine was reclassified LPSS-282. She was decommissioned on 28 June 1969, and, on 30 June 1969, her name was struck from the &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Vessel%20Register\"&gt;Naval Vessel Register&lt;/a&gt;. She was sunk as a target on 19 June 1970.\nAwards.\nIn April 1997, officers and men of \"Tunny\" and the other four US Navy submarines that conducted &lt;a href=\"Deterrence%20theory\"&gt;strategic deterrent&lt;/a&gt; patrols in the Western Pacific between 1959 and 1964 were awarded the right to wear the Navy's &lt;a href=\"SSBN%20Deterrent%20Patrol%20insignia\"&gt;SSBN Deterrent Patrol insignia&lt;/a&gt;."
