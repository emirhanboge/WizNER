    "text": "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Batthy\u00e1ny-Strattmann (; 28 October 1870 \u2013 22 January 1931) was a &lt;a href=\"Nobility%20and%20royalty%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Hungary\"&gt;Hungarian aristocrat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"physician\"&gt;physician&lt;/a&gt;. Until 1914, he was known as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Batthy\u00e1ny. A devout &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, he became known as the \"doctor of the poor\" and was &lt;a href=\"beatification\"&gt;beatified&lt;/a&gt; by the church in 2003.\nEarly life.\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Batthy\u00e1ny - Strattmann was born on 28 October 1870, in &lt;a href=\"Dunakiliti\"&gt;Dunakiliti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, into a very old &lt;a href=\"Batthy%C3%A1ny\"&gt;Hungarian aristocratic family&lt;/a&gt;, the sixth of ten brothers. The family moved to Austria in 1876. His childhood was marred by the fact that his father left his family and converted to &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestantism&lt;/a&gt; in order to marry another woman. Ladislaus' mother died when he was twelve years old.\nAccording to the will of his father, he first prepared himself to care for the vast property of the Batthy\u00e1nys. He first studied &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt; in Vienna, later also a great number of other subjects, including &lt;a href=\"chemistry\"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;. In this chaotic period in his life, he also fathered an &lt;a href=\"illegitimacy\"&gt;illegitimate&lt;/a&gt; daughter.\nCareer and family.\nBatthy\u00e1ny became a student of &lt;a href=\"medicine\"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt; in 1896, and gained his degree of &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Medicine\"&gt;M.D.&lt;/a&gt; in 1900. He trained as a &lt;a href=\"general%20practitioner\"&gt;general practitioner&lt;/a&gt;, but soon specialized in &lt;a href=\"surgery\"&gt;surgery&lt;/a&gt;, and later in &lt;a href=\"ophthalmology\"&gt;ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;. This period was also accompanied by a renewal of his religious faith. He met Countess Maria Theresia Coreth zu Coredo und Starkenberg, a devout Roman Catholic, whom he married in Vienna on 10 November 1898. The couple had thirteen children.\nIn 1902 Batthy\u00e1ny opened a private hospital with twenty-five beds in &lt;a href=\"Kittsee\"&gt;Kittsee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked as a general practitioner, later specializing as a surgeon and oculist. During the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt;, the hospital was enlarged to take in wounded soldiers for treatment.\nIn 1915, Batthy\u00e1ny and his family moved to the castle of &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6rmend\"&gt;K\u00f6rmend&lt;/a&gt; in Hungary, which he had inherited upon the death of his kinsman &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Edmund%20Batthyany-Strattmann\"&gt;Prince Edmund Batthyany-Strattmann&lt;/a&gt; in 1914; he also inherited the title of \"Prince\" (German \"&lt;a href=\"F%C3%BCrst\"&gt;F\u00fcrst&lt;/a&gt;\", Hungarian \"herceg\") and adopted the additional surname of \"Strattmann\". At K\u00f6rmend he continued to practise as a doctor, becoming known for treating poor patients for no payment, which gained him the title of \"doctor of the poor\". Batthy\u00e1ny turned a wing of the castle into a hospital for ophthalmological patients.\nDeath.\nAt the age of 60, Batthy\u00e1ny was diagnosed with &lt;a href=\"bladder%20cancer\"&gt;cancer of the bladder&lt;/a&gt; and admitted to the L\u00f6w &lt;a href=\"sanatorium\"&gt;sanatorium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;. After fourteen months of illness, he died in January 1931.\nBeatification.\nThe beatification process was begun in 1944 as a joint effort of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Archbishop of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; (Austria) and the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Szombathely\"&gt;bishop of Szombathely&lt;/a&gt; (Hungary). The process became forgotten for some time afterwards, before it was taken up again in 1982 due to the initiative of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Eisenstadt\"&gt;bishop of Eisenstadt&lt;/a&gt; (Austria), Stefan L\u00e1szl\u00f3. On 11 July 1992 L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Batthy\u00e1ny-Strattmann was declared a &lt;a href=\"Venerable\"&gt;Venerable&lt;/a&gt; - a necessary step for beatification. He was beatified on 23 March 2003 by Pope &lt;a href=\"John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;. Five years later, on 23 March 2008, the fifth anniversary of his beatification, the Dr. Ladislaus Batthy\u00e1ny-Strattmann confraternity of prayer for the canonization of the poor's doctor was invested by the archbishop of Vienna &lt;a href=\"Christoph%20Sch%C3%B6nborn\"&gt;Christoph Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn&lt;/a&gt; as a private &lt;a href=\"Associations%20of%20the%20faithful\"&gt;association&lt;/a&gt;, being entitled under the justification of &lt;a href=\"canon%20law\"&gt;canon law&lt;/a&gt;."
