    "text": "Gordon Ross (born 8 March 1978) is a &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; footballer who played &lt;a href=\"Fly-half%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;fly-half&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoss represented Edinburgh and Scottish Schools at U16 and U18 level before going on to represent Scotland at &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20under-19%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;U19&lt;/a&gt; and at U21 levels. He attended &lt;a href=\"George%20Heriot%27s%20School\"&gt;George Heriot's School&lt;/a&gt; and started his senior career with Heriots before joining Edinburgh when Scotland opted for regional rugby in 2000.\nThe highlight of his early career was kicking the winning goal for &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20Rugby\"&gt;Edinburgh Rugby&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Biarritz%20Olympique\"&gt;Biarritz Olympique&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 and beating England as part of the Scotland U19 squad in the same season. He played a pivotal role in &lt;a href=\"Heriot%27s%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;Heriot's FP&lt;/a&gt;'s second successive league title in 1999-00 and was duly rewarded with a professional contract with the &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20Rugby\"&gt;Edinburgh Reivers&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nRoss stayed with the Reivers from 2000 until 2002, when he moved to Leeds and stayed until 2006. He was voted Man of the Match when they won the Powergen Cup in 2005 beating Bath 20\u201312, a game in which Ross scored two penalties and two conversions.\nIn 2006 he joined Castres for one season before moving on to Saracens, where he played for two seasons before joining London Welsh in 2009.\nIn his debut season at Welsh he scored 30 points in 26 appearances, and helped the club reach the Championship semi-finals, where they lost to Bristol.\nGordon endured an injury disrupted 2010/11 campaign, picking up a groin injury in the win over Bristol at Old Deer Park in October. He returned in January against the Ulster Ravens and helped Welsh reach a second consecutive Championship semi-final. He made 23 appearances, scoring 212 points, including a late match winning penalty to beat Bedford.\nGordon made 31 appearances during the 2011/12 season and racked up 110 points in the Championship, including a 16-point haul as Welsh beat his former club Leeds at Headingley on the opening weekend of the season.\nHis penalty with the last kick of the game gave Welsh an 18\u201316 win over London Scottish at Old Deer Park, while he landed a crucial drop goal in the first leg of the Championship final against the Cornish Pirates at Menneye Field.\nRoss has played Heineken Cup rugby for Leeds, Castres, Edinburgh and Saracens, making 40 appearances in Europe, scoring 263 points.\nInternational career.\nA prodigious goal-kicker, Gordon Ross enjoyed a dream debut for Scotland with a record of 23 points in the 43\u201320 success against Tonga at Murrayfield in November 2001. Seven years later, during the Barclays Churchill Cup competition in North America, he set another record as the Scotland A team's top scorer. He passed Duncan Hodge's record of 126 points during a replacement appearance win against Argentina at Richardson Stadium in Kingston, Ontario. By the end of that 2008 tournament his tally in 16 Scotland A games was 140 points. They are the only players to have scored at least 100 points for Scotland A.\nLater that year Gordon took that record total to 150 points with five conversions in Scotland A's victory against Georgia at Firhill, Glasgow, and in February 2009 he extended his Scotland A appearances to 18 when he played as a replacement against Ireland A at the RDS, Dublin. A further A international appearance and seven points were added in the 22-all draw with Italy at McDiarmid Park, Perth, taking his points tally to 157.\nGordon's first Test try was included in an 18-point haul in the 2003 RWC Countdown victory over Italy, also at Murrayfield, and he scored his first drop goal for Scotland in the 13\u201310 victory over Italy in the final match of the 2006 RBS 6 Nations. In 2002 his assurance and control were key factors in Scotland's Murrayfield win against South Africa. Earlier in the year he emerged as joint top scorer (36 points) on Scotland's tour of North America during which he played in all three midweek victories. Gordon reached his Scotland A century while captaining the team in victory against Italy A at McDiarmid Park, Perth, in February 2007.\nGordon kicked 17 points on his debut for Scotland A as they accounted for their Welsh counterparts 42\u201320 in February 2001. His goal-kicking was to the fore in the next A victory, too \u2013 the 33\u201313 success against Italy A in which he contributed 13 points. In February 2002 he kicked two goals from two attempts in quagmire conditions to ensure Scotland A opened their shadow Six Nations campaign with a 6\u20136 draw against their English counterparts. Better followed a fortnight later when his last-gasp conversion 20 metres from the right touchline earned the Scots a 30\u201329 victory over Italy A to which Ross contributed a total of 20 points, including a try. He had a full house in a haul of 18 points (try, penalty, two conversions and two drop goals) against Wales A at Wrexham in 2002. He played in seven A internationals in 2001 and 2002, and he returned to that level in the Perth match against Australia A in November 2006. He played in two wins in 2007 (against Italy A at McDiarmid Park and against the USA at Henley in the Barclays Churchill Cup competition) as well as two more in 2008 (v Italy A in Mogliano and Ireland A) before that year's Churchill Cup.\nDuring a time that the national team were lacking in depth at the number 10 position it is still a point of mystery to many Scotland fans as to why he never picked up further caps beyond the 25 he collected. A preference of &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Parks\"&gt;Dan Parks&lt;/a&gt; by coaches &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Williams%20%28rugby%20coach%29\"&gt;Matt Williams&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Hadden\"&gt;Frank Hadden&lt;/a&gt; and eventual emergence of a more running fly half in &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Godman\"&gt;Phil Godman&lt;/a&gt; may have curtailed further call up opportunities.\nAdditional achievements.\nGordon played golf for Scottish Schools with a handicap of two and also played cricket at district level."
