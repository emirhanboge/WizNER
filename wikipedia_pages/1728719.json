    "text": "Judah Bergman, known as Jack Kid Berg or Jackie Kid Berg (28 June 1909 \u2013 22 April 1991), was an English &lt;a href=\"boxing\"&gt;boxer&lt;/a&gt; born in the &lt;a href=\"East%20End%20of%20London\"&gt;East End of London&lt;/a&gt;, who became the World Light Welterweight Champion in 1930.\nBiography.\nJudah Bergman was born in Romford Street near &lt;a href=\"Cable%20Street\"&gt;Cable Street&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St%20George%20in%20the%20East%20%28parish%29\"&gt;St George in the East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stepney\"&gt;Stepney&lt;/a&gt;. His father Judah Senior, who found work as a tailor in America, and his mother Mildred immigrated from Odessa. His siblings included Wolf, changed to Willie, Rebecca and Sarah. He was apprenticed as a lather boy in a barber's shop, and began his boxing career at the \"Premierland\", Back Church Lane, when he was 14. &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;ish Berg boxed with a &lt;a href=\"Star%20of%20David\"&gt;Star of David&lt;/a&gt; on his trunks.\nThe book \"The Whitechapel Windmill\" covers the handsome boxer's rise in the boxing world as well as his flamboyant out-of-the-ring life, which is said to have included an affair with &lt;a href=\"Mae%20West\"&gt;Mae West&lt;/a&gt; and a long-lasting friendship with fellow East Ender &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Comer\"&gt;Jack Comer&lt;/a&gt;, the colourful (and also Jewish) gangster.\nAfter losing his British Lightweight crown, he lived to be the oldest British boxing champion. Berg died in London on 22 April 1991.\nHe is commemorated by a &lt;a href=\"blue%20plaque\"&gt;blue plaque&lt;/a&gt; on Noble Court, Cable Street, close to the place where he was born. &lt;a href=\"Stepney%20Historical%20Trust\"&gt;Stepney Historical Trust&lt;/a&gt; presented the plaque at a ceremony attended by the Chief Rabbi, the Bishop of Stepney Richard Chartres, Professor Bill Fishman, Councillor Albert lilley and the Retired Boxers Federation. Later in the evening the Trust held a Charity Ball to raise funds for the Retired Boxers Federation attended by Mr Cox, Chairman of the Boxing Association and also the local Arbour Youth and Repton Boxing Clubs Boys. Over a \u00a31000 was raised for the Retired Boxing charity.\nCareer.\nBetween 1923 and 1936, Berg had 192 professional fights, winning 157 of them. His record was 157\u201326\u20139. Fifty seven wins were by knock out.\nIn 1931 he moved to the USA, where he won 64 out of 76 fights there. During his bouts in America, he was trained by legendary boxing trainer &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Arcel\"&gt;Ray Arcel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1930, Berg defeated the great &lt;a href=\"Cubans\"&gt;Cuban&lt;/a&gt; fighter &lt;a href=\"Kid%20Chocolate\"&gt;Kid Chocolate&lt;/a&gt; in ten rounds. The Chocolate bout, fought in Queens, New York in 1932, had 10,000 spectators, larger than many of his British bouts. In 1930, he knocked out the American champion &lt;a href=\"Mushy%20Callahan\"&gt;Mushy Callahan&lt;/a&gt; to take the World Light Welterweight Championship in London. The &lt;a href=\"World%20Boxing%20Association\"&gt;National Boxing Association&lt;/a&gt; (NBA) had stripped Callahan before this fight and Britain did not recognize this division, so only the New York State Athletic Commission recognized Berg as champion after this fight. The NBA only recognized Berg as champion after he beat Goldie Hess in January 1931.\nBerg fought as a &lt;a href=\"lightweight\"&gt;lightweight&lt;/a&gt; when he put his title on the line to meet with &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Canzoneri\"&gt;Tony Canzoneri&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago on 24 April 1931. He was quickly knocked out in three rounds, falling on his face and stumbling to get up before giving in and collapsing into the ropes. Berg, contending that he lost at lightweight and not at light welterweight, continued to claim that he was champion. Most of the boxing world recognized Canzoneri, however. He unsuccessfully challenged Canzoneri again for the title in September 1931.\nAfter the Canzoneri bout, Berg continued boxing with mixed results. He became British lightweight champion in 1934 by beating the title holder &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Mizler\"&gt;Harry Mizler&lt;/a&gt;, another Jewish boxer. He was thrust back into the limelight as a replacement for the injured Canzoneri against Cleto Locatelli at &lt;a href=\"Madison%20Square%20Garden\"&gt;Madison Square Garden&lt;/a&gt;, but his hopes of challenging for the world title faded after a points defeat to Gustave Humery in Paris in February 1935, also losing a return bout in London in April, although Berg was still British champion at this point. Later that year he lost to &lt;a href=\"Laurie%20Stevens\"&gt;Laurie Stevens&lt;/a&gt; in a fight for the British Empire lightweight title in &lt;a href=\"Johannesburg\"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to fighting at welterweight in the United States with some success. In August 1936, after three straight defeats, he announced his retirement, but returned in January 1937 with a victory against Ivor Pickens, the first of a nine fight unbeaten run. In January 1941 he moved up to middleweight to fight Harry Craster. He again beat Mizler in February 1941 and defeated British lightweight champion &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Boon\"&gt;Eric Boon&lt;/a&gt; on a disqualification due to a low blow in a non-title fight in April 1941. After a victory over Eric Dolby in March 1945, Berg expressed a desire to once more challenge for a title, saying \"What I need is fights. I'm a bad gymnasium worker, but I'll show what I can do in the ring. When I've had a few warm up fights I'll know where I stand. If I'm no good I'll quit.\" He had two further fights, the last a win by knockout against Johnny MacDonald in May 1945, before retiring.\nBerg's brother Teddy was also a boxer, and the two fought on the same bill in 1941.\nAfter retiring from boxing, he worked as a film stunt man, joined the Royal Air Force, and owned a restaurant in London.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1930 Berg's marriage to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20University\"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt; student Eleanor Kraus, the daughter of a New York silk merchant, was announced, although by November 1931 the relationship had ended. In September 1930 Berg was served with a writ claiming \u00a310,000 for breach of promise by Sophia Levy, who claimed the two had a relationship. Berg married Bunty Pain, a dancer at the Trocadero, on 11 August 1933 at Prince's Row register office in London.\nIn October 1940 he was awarded \u00a3500 damages for slander after John Macadam suggested in a &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; broadcast that Berg would fight Eric Boon after \"drawing his old-age pension\" and \"tottering along to Earl's Court\", although the decision was overturned on appeal.\nHall of Fame.\nBerg was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"International%20Boxing%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;International Boxing Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nBerg was also inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame.\nBerg, who was &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;ish, was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"International%20Jewish%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 1993."
