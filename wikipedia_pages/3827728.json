The song was written and produced by &lt;a href=\"Stock%20Aitken%20Waterman\"&gt;Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, the song was planned to be released after the single \"&lt;a href=\"Better%20the%20Devil%20You%20Know\"&gt;Better the Devil You Know&lt;/a&gt;\", but instead \"&lt;a href=\"Step%20Back%20in%20Time\"&gt;Step Back in Time&lt;/a&gt;\" was released and this was released as the third single on 21 January 1991. The song received positive reviews from most music critics, who thought the song was an instant rave classic.\nThe song peaked at number eleven in her native Australia. The song did however peak at number six in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a success there. The song was also hit in France and The Netherlands.\nThe song has been performed on most of Minogue's concert tours, including her &lt;a href=\"Rhythm%20of%20Love%20Tour\"&gt;Rhythm of Love Tour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Let%27s%20Get%20to%20It%20Tour\"&gt;Let's Get to It Tour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intimate%20and%20Live%20Tour\"&gt;Intimate and Live Tour&lt;/a&gt;.

The early unreleased first version is synth orienated and has multilayered vocals. Much of the synth was omitted and the drums, bass and vocals were toned down for the second album version. The third version, the 7\" Mix, contains a newer drum track, multilayered vocals in the chorus and relies much less on the synthesizers than on the album version. This version of the song also contains samples from American comedian &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Kinison\"&gt;Sam Kinison&lt;/a&gt;, and was used for the music video. In the UK a limited edition 7\u2033 single came with postcards with shots from the video.\nOriginally, \"What Do I Have To Do\" was planned to be released as the follow-up single to \"&lt;a href=\"Better%20the%20Devil%20You%20Know\"&gt;Better the Devil You Know&lt;/a&gt;\", but was later released as the third single off the album instead, and the track was specially remixed for single release. The 1999 biographical book \"Girl Next Door\" identified this track as Kylie's favourite to perform live.\nThe single artwork was photographed by Robert Erdmann.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"What Do I Have To Do?\" received very positive reviews from many music critics. Jason Shawahn from &lt;a href=\"About.com\"&gt;About.com&lt;/a&gt; said the song, along with \"&lt;a href=\"Better%20The%20Devil%20You%20Know\"&gt;Better The Devil You Know&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Wouldn%27t%20Change%20a%20Thing%20%28Kylie%20Minogue%20song%29\"&gt;Wouldn't Change a Thing&lt;/a&gt;\", \"are nothing if not &lt;a href=\"pop%20music\"&gt;pop&lt;/a&gt; masterpieces.\" He also labeled it as a \"pop classic\". Quentin Harrison from Albumism noted it as \"luxuriant electro-pop\", adding that Ian Curnow and &lt;a href=\"Phil%20Harding%20%28producer%29\"&gt;Phil Harding&lt;/a&gt; \"rework it into an appetizing, but accessible &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; ditty that emphasizes unity between the single's beat and Minogue's supple vocal.\" While reviewing \"&lt;a href=\"Rhythm%20of%20Love%20%28Kylie%20Minogue%20album%29\"&gt;Rhythm of Love&lt;/a&gt;\", Chris True from &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the song as an album standout. \"&lt;a href=\"NME\"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt;\" voted it as the thirtieth best track of 1991. Eleanor Levy from \"&lt;a href=\"Record%20Mirror\"&gt;Record Mirror&lt;/a&gt;\" described it as \"more mature, in a &lt;a href=\"Hi-NRG\"&gt;Hi-NRG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bronski%20Beat\"&gt;Bronski Beat&lt;/a&gt;ish way.\" She added, \"More straightforward rhythm than formula pop song, it fizzes predictably rather than sparkles but, like Kylie's ever-elongating fringe, will no doubt grow and grow.\" Caroline Sullivan from \"&lt;a href=\"Smash%20Hits\"&gt;Smash Hits&lt;/a&gt;\" called it \"supreme\", and said the song \"sees a return to the reassuring old Kylie-sound\". While reviewing \"&lt;a href=\"Ultimate%20Kylie\"&gt;Ultimate Kylie&lt;/a&gt;\", Mark Edwards from &lt;a href=\"Stylus%20Magazine\"&gt;Stylus Magazine&lt;/a&gt; gave it a positive remark, saying that along with \"&lt;a href=\"Shocked%20%28song%29\"&gt;Shocked&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Give%20Me%20Just%20a%20Little%20More%20Time%23Kylie%20Minogue%20version\"&gt;Give Me Just a Little More Time&lt;/a&gt;\", they \"were great songs and suddenly Kylie was a little bit cool.\"\nChart performance.\n\"What Do I Have to Do\" debuted at number twenty-seven on the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;Australian Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;, until rising and peaking at number eleven, staying there for two consecutive weeks. The song then debuted at number ninety-nine on the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20Top%2040\"&gt;Dutch Top 40&lt;/a&gt;, until peaking at number eighty-one for one week. The song then debuted and peaked at number fifty on the &lt;a href=\"French%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;French Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt;.\nImpact and legacy.\nEnglish DJ and record producer &lt;a href=\"Nicky%20Holloway\"&gt;Nicky Holloway&lt;/a&gt; chose \"What Do I Have to Do\" as one of his top 10 vinyl thrills in 1996, saying, \"I've had so much fun with this over the years. You don't realise what you're dancing to until it's too late to stop! It's got a long intro so people are dancing away and don't realise that it's Kylie Minogue until they're sucked into it.\"\nMusic video.\nThe &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; for the song was directed by Dave Hogan. In relation to this video, Minogue is quoted as saying \"how many Hollywood stars can you look like in three and a half minutes...\". Her younger sister &lt;a href=\"Dannii%20Minogue\"&gt;Dannii Minogue&lt;/a&gt; also appears in the video. The music video begins with clips of the dance scene intercut with Minogue emerging from a swimming pool and her love interest seeing her with another man. The love interest is played by &lt;a href=\"Zane%20O%27Donnell\"&gt;Zane O'Donnell&lt;/a&gt;, the same model who would appear in the video for Minogue's subsequent single \"Shocked\". \nMinogue then goes out to the balcony overlooking a fairground and the man follows. The video then shifts to the man watching Minogue dancing with a female friend in a club. The next scene is Minogue waking up in her lover's bed as he prepares to leave the bedroom. After this, Minogue singing on the bed is intercut with scenes of her singing and dancing in front of a white backdrop. The video goes back to her and her friend having fun in the club as the man stares at her again. Later, she sits on the bench overlooking the scene and takes a glance at a lookalike of her lover next to her. Following this, she gets up to dance as the man watches. Finally, she gets a tattoo of a &lt;a href=\"black%20panther\"&gt;black panther&lt;/a&gt; on her back and shows it to her lover. The video concludes with all of Minogue's performance scenes intercut with her doing the ironing in a &lt;a href=\"Gingham\"&gt;Gingham&lt;/a&gt; Apron and on a date with her lover. The final shot is of Minogue and her lover walking across a bridge.\nWhile reviewing the DVD version of \"&lt;a href=\"Greatest%20Hits%2087%E2%80%9397\"&gt;Greatest Hits&lt;/a&gt;\" for &lt;a href=\"Amazon.co.uk\"&gt;Amazon.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;, John Galilee said \"Her most outrageous but greatest video moment is where she parodies certain movie stars in the chic video for \"What Do I Have to Do?\", and because of her heavy eye make-up almost earns herself the title drag-queen Kylie (watch out for sister Dannii who briefly stars in the video, wearing a blonde wig).\"\nFormats and track listings.\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"What Do I Have to Do\".\nLive performances.\nMinogue performed the song on the following concert tours:\nThe song was also performed on:"
