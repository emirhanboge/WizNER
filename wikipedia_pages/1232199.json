    "text": "Francisco de Pe\u00f1alosa (c. 1470 \u2013 April 1, 1528) was a Spanish composer of the middle &lt;a href=\"Renaissance%20music\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Talavera%20de%20la%20Reina\"&gt;Talavera de la Reina&lt;/a&gt; in the province of &lt;a href=\"Toledo%20%28province%29\"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;. He spent most of his career in &lt;a href=\"Seville\"&gt;Seville&lt;/a&gt;, serving as the \"maestro di capilla\", though he also spent time in &lt;a href=\"Burgos\"&gt;Burgos&lt;/a&gt;, and three years in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; at the papal chapel (1518\u20131521). He died in Seville.\nMusic and influence.\nPe\u00f1alosa was one of the most famous Spanish composers of the generation before &lt;a href=\"Crist%C3%B3bal%20de%20Morales\"&gt;Crist\u00f3bal de Morales&lt;/a&gt;, and his compositions were highly regarded at the time. Unfortunately for him, his music was not widely distributed; he did not benefit from the invention of &lt;a href=\"printing\"&gt;printing&lt;/a&gt;, since he mostly remained in Spain, away from cities such as &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt; which were the first centers of printed music. Later generations of Spanish composers\u2014&lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Guerrero%20%28composer%29\"&gt;Guerrero&lt;/a&gt;, Morales, &lt;a href=\"Tom%C3%A1s%20Luis%20de%20Victoria\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;\u2014went to &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; for parts of their careers, where their compositions were printed and were as widely distributed as the music of the &lt;a href=\"Dutch%20School%20%28music%29\"&gt;Franco-Flemish&lt;/a&gt; composers who dominated music in Europe in the 16th century.\nPe\u00f1alosa wrote &lt;a href=\"mass%20%28music%29\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Magnificat\"&gt;Magnificat&lt;/a&gt; settings, &lt;a href=\"motet\"&gt;motet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hymn\"&gt;hymn&lt;/a&gt;s. Eleven secular compositions have survived, including an &lt;a href=\"ensalada%20%28music%29\"&gt;ensalada&lt;/a&gt; (a form of &lt;a href=\"quodlibet\"&gt;quodlibet&lt;/a&gt;) \"Por las sierras de Madrid\" for six voices.\nPe\u00f1alosa was evidently fond of &lt;a href=\"counterpoint\"&gt;contrapuntal&lt;/a&gt; puzzles and canons, as evidenced by the quodlibet, and by the Agnus Dei of his \"Missa Ave Maria peregrina\", which combines a &lt;a href=\"plainsong\"&gt;plainsong&lt;/a&gt; tune with a &lt;a href=\"Permutation%20%28music%29\"&gt;retrograde&lt;/a&gt; (backwards) version of a famous secular song by &lt;a href=\"Hayne%20van%20Ghizeghem\"&gt;Hayne van Ghizeghem&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of his motets (\"Sancta mater istud agas\") was long assumed to be by &lt;a href=\"Josquin%20des%20Prez\"&gt;Josquin des Prez&lt;/a&gt;, which indicates both the stylistic similarity of their music and the high quality of Pe\u00f1alosa's."
