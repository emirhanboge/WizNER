As a result, the &lt;a href=\"Portuguese%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Portuguese Football Federation&lt;/a&gt; (FPF) banned \u00c2ngelo from football, although the punishment would only last for a few months.\nThree years later, when \u00c2ngelo was a worker at his father's shoe store and was serving in the military in &lt;a href=\"Santar%C3%A9m%2C%20Portugal\"&gt;Santar\u00e9m&lt;/a&gt; at age 20, a Benfica &lt;a href=\"Scout%20%28sport%29\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; watched him play and brought him to Lisbon in 1951 to represent Benfica's reserves, with the FPF backing down on his ban. During his 13 seasons with \"The Eagles\"' main team, from 1952 to 1965, he made 285 appearances and scored 4 goals, winning 7 &lt;a href=\"Primeira%20Liga\"&gt;Primeira Liga&lt;/a&gt; titles, 5 &lt;a href=\"Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Ta\u00e7a de Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Honra\"&gt;Ta\u00e7a de Honra&lt;/a&gt;, and 2 consecutive &lt;a href=\"European%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt;s (in &lt;a href=\"1960%20European%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1961&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1962%20European%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1962&lt;/a&gt;). He retired as a player at age 35.\nInternational career.\n\u00c2ngelo played for &lt;a href=\"Portugal%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; on 20 occasions.
