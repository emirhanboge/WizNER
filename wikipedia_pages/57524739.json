    "text": "The 2018\u201319 Pro14 (also known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Guinness%20Brewery\"&gt;Guinness&lt;/a&gt; Pro14\" for sponsorship reasons) is the eighteenth season of the professional &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; competition originally known as the &lt;a href=\"Pro14\"&gt;Celtic League&lt;/a&gt;. It was the second season to be referred to as the \"Pro14\" (the competition was named the \"Pro12\" immediately prior to the addition of two South African teams).\nFourteen teams competed in 2018-19 \u2014 four Irish teams: &lt;a href=\"Connacht%20Rugby\"&gt;Connacht&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Rugby\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Munster%20Rugby\"&gt;Munster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulster%20Rugby\"&gt;Ulster&lt;/a&gt;; two Italian teams: &lt;a href=\"Benetton%20Rugby\"&gt;Benetton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zebre\"&gt;Zebre&lt;/a&gt;; two Scottish teams: &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh%20Rugby\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glasgow%20Warriors\"&gt;Glasgow Warriors&lt;/a&gt;; two South African teams: &lt;a href=\"Cheetahs%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Cheetahs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Kings\"&gt;Southern Kings&lt;/a&gt;; and four Welsh teams: &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20Blues\"&gt;Cardiff Blues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ospreys%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Ospreys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scarlets\"&gt;Scarlets&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeinster were the defending champions, having won the 2017-18 final at the &lt;a href=\"Aviva%20Stadium\"&gt;Aviva Stadium&lt;/a&gt; to take their fifth title in the competition's various iterations and seal a domestic league and &lt;a href=\"European%20Rugby%20Champions%20Cup\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt; double, becoming only the sixth team to do so and the first from the Pro14.\nFormat.\nThe fourteen teams are split into two conferences of seven teams, with each conference featuring two teams from Ireland and Wales plus one team from Italy, Scotland and South Africa. To ensure a competitive balance, the teams are distributed approximately evenly between the conferences based upon their performance in the previous season.\nThe regular season is made up of 21 rounds \u2013\n&lt;br&gt;6 home and 6 away games against each team in their own conference\n&lt;br&gt;7 games, either home or away, against the teams in the other conference\n&lt;br&gt;2 additional regional derbies\nThe first-placed teams in each conference are given a bye to the semi-finals with the second and third placed teams in each conference meeting in two quarter-finals for the two remaining semi-final places.\nThe South African teams cannot compete in the European Rugby Champions Cup. The top three eligible European teams in each conference automatically qualify for following year's Champions Cup. The fourth ranked eligible team in each conference meet in a play-off match with the winner taking the seventh Champions Cup place.\nTeam changes.\nIreland.\n&lt;a href=\"Connacht%20Rugby\"&gt;Connacht&lt;/a&gt; came into the new season with a new head coach, after removing &lt;a href=\"Kieran%20Keane\"&gt;Kieran Keane&lt;/a&gt; from his position one year into a three-year deal. Former &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20sevens%20team\"&gt;Australia sevens&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Friend\"&gt;Andy Friend&lt;/a&gt; was named as his replacement in May 2018, joining on a three-year contract. The team also had a new captain for the season, following the retirement of &lt;a href=\"John%20Muldoon%20%28rugby%20player%20born%201982%29\"&gt;John Muldoon&lt;/a&gt;, record-holder for appearances both for Connacht and in the league. In August 2018, &lt;a href=\"Jarrad%20Butler\"&gt;Jarrad Butler&lt;/a&gt; was named as his replacement.\nLike Connacht, &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Rugby\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; had a new captain for the season. &lt;a href=\"Isa%20Nacewa\"&gt;Isa Nacewa&lt;/a&gt; retired at the end of the 2017\u201318 season, after leading the province to an unprecedented &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Pro14\"&gt;Pro14&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20European%20Rugby%20Champions%20Cup\"&gt;Champions Cup&lt;/a&gt; double. The team's all-time leading scorer &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Sexton\"&gt;Jonathan Sexton&lt;/a&gt; was named as captain in August 2018, with &lt;a href=\"Rhys%20Ruddock\"&gt;Rhys Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; as his vice-captain. The team also had a new backs coach following the departure of &lt;a href=\"Girvan%20Dempsey\"&gt;Girvan Dempsey&lt;/a&gt;, who signed with &lt;a href=\"Premiership%20Rugby\"&gt;English Premiership&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Rugby\"&gt;Bath&lt;/a&gt; in May 2018. Former player &lt;a href=\"Felipe%20Contepomi\"&gt;Felipe Contepomi&lt;/a&gt; was announced as his replacement in June 2018. He joined from the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Argentine Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; where he had been serving both as part of the coaching staff of &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt; side, the &lt;a href=\"Jaguares%20%28Super%20Rugby%29\"&gt;Jaguares&lt;/a&gt;, and as head coach of &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20XV%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Argentina XV&lt;/a&gt;, the country's second tier international side.\n&lt;a href=\"Munster%20Rugby\"&gt;Munster&lt;/a&gt; came into the league without their all-time leading try scorer &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Zebo\"&gt;Simon Zebo&lt;/a&gt;. It was announced in October 2017 that he would leave the province at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20Munster%20Rugby%20season\"&gt;2017\u201318 season&lt;/a&gt;, with French &lt;a href=\"Top%2014\"&gt;Top 14&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Racing%2092\"&gt;Racing 92&lt;/a&gt; later being confirmed as his next club.\nFollowing the departure of &lt;a href=\"Les%20Kiss\"&gt;Les Kiss&lt;/a&gt; as the province's director of rugby in January 2018, &lt;a href=\"Ulster%20Rugby\"&gt;Ulster&lt;/a&gt; confirmed in March 2018 that then-head coach &lt;a href=\"Jono%20Gibbes\"&gt;Jono Gibbes&lt;/a&gt; would leave the province at the end of the season. In April 2018, the province announced that &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; forwards coach &lt;a href=\"Dan%20McFarland\"&gt;Dan McFarland&lt;/a&gt; would be their new head coach, with the former Connacht and &lt;a href=\"Glasgow%20Warriors\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt; assistant signing a three-year contract. However the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Scottish Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; insisted that McFarland must serve the nine-month notice period in his contract before joining Ulster, which would have left the province without a head coach until January 2019. In July 2018, it was announced that Ireland forwards coach &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Easterby\"&gt;Simon Easterby&lt;/a&gt; would work with the Ulster coaches on an interim basis ahead of McFarland's arrival. After a four-month standoff, an agreement was reached in August 2018 to allow McFarland to take up his position with Ulster with immediate effect. Another addition to the coaching staff was long-serving squad member and international &lt;a href=\"Jared%20Payne\"&gt;Jared Payne&lt;/a&gt;, who was forced to retire in May 2018 due to a head injury suffered on the &lt;a href=\"2017%20British%20%26amp%3B%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;2017 Lions tour&lt;/a&gt;. The province announced that he would serve as their new defence coach. &lt;a href=\"Banbridge%20RFC\"&gt;Banbridge&lt;/a&gt; head coach Daniel Soper was confirmed as Ulster's skills coach in June 2018.\nItaly.\nHaving served as one of the team's co-captain's, centre &lt;a href=\"Tommaso%20Castello\"&gt;Tommaso Castello&lt;/a&gt; was named as the &lt;a href=\"Zebre\"&gt;Zebre&lt;/a&gt; skipper for the season. He had previously shared the captaincy with &lt;a href=\"George%20Biagi\"&gt;George Biagi&lt;/a&gt;.\nScotland.\nAfter spending much of the previous two seasons playing in the 5,500-capacity &lt;a href=\"Myreside%20Stadium\"&gt;Myreside Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, Edinburgh announced in February 2018 that they would be returning permanently to &lt;a href=\"Murrayfield%20Stadium\"&gt;Murrayfield&lt;/a&gt;, their previous home. Due to the stadium's larger size making it inappropriate for permanent use, the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Scottish Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; also announced plans to develop another, smaller ground with a capacity of 7,800 in the grounds of Murrayfield, on what were previously training pitches. It was estimated that the development would cost the Union in the region of \u00a35 million.\nSouth Africa.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cheetahs%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Cheetahs&lt;/a&gt; had a new captain for the 2018\u201319 season. It was announced in March 2018 that incumbent captain &lt;a href=\"Francois%20Venter\"&gt;Francois Venter&lt;/a&gt; would leave the team at the end of the season, joining English side &lt;a href=\"Worcester%20Warriors\"&gt;Worcester Warriors&lt;/a&gt;.\nWales.\n&lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20Blues\"&gt;Cardiff Blues&lt;/a&gt; confirmed in September 2017 that then-head coach &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Wilson%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Danny Wilson&lt;/a&gt; would leave the club at the end of the 2017\u201318 season, with John Mulvihill being announced as their new head coach on a three-year contract in March 2018. Also departing the club was the team's most-capped player, &lt;a href=\"Taufa%CA%BBao%20Filise\"&gt;Taufa\u02bbao Filise&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tonga%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Tongan international&lt;/a&gt; prop made his last appearance for the region in the final of the &lt;a href=\"2017%E2%80%9318%20European%20Rugby%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;2017\u201318 Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt;, before retiring. In July 2018, &lt;a href=\"Ellis%20Jenkins\"&gt;Ellis Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; was named as the new team captain, replacing previous season's skipper &lt;a href=\"Gethin%20Jenkins\"&gt;Gethin Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;. Both players were also named as part of a 10-man \"leadership group\" within the squad.\nIn December 2018, &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; parted company with head coach &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Jackman\"&gt;Bernard Jackman&lt;/a&gt; 18 months into a three-year deal. The team's forwards coach &lt;a href=\"Ceri%20Jones\"&gt;Ceri Jones&lt;/a&gt; was named as caretaker following Jackman's departure. In January 2019, it was announced that Jones would remain in the role until the end of the season.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ospreys%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Ospreys&lt;/a&gt; were coached by &lt;a href=\"Allen%20Clarke%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Allen Clarke&lt;/a&gt;. He had started the previous season as the team's forwards coach, before being promoted to head coach on an interim basis in January 2018 following the sacking of &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Tandy\"&gt;Steve Tandy&lt;/a&gt;. In April 2018, it was announced that Clarke would take the job on a permanent basis and had signed a three-year contract. For the first time in eight seasons, the side came into the campaign with a new captain, with &lt;a href=\"Justin%20Tipuric\"&gt;Justin Tipuric&lt;/a&gt; replacing &lt;a href=\"Alun%20Wyn%20Jones\"&gt;Alun Wyn Jones&lt;/a&gt; in the role.\nThis was &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20Pivac\"&gt;Wayne Pivac&lt;/a&gt;'s final season in charge of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlets\"&gt;Scarlets&lt;/a&gt;, as it was announced in July 2018 that he would succeed &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Gatland\"&gt;Warren Gatland&lt;/a&gt; as head coach. The agreement meant Pivac would take up the role following the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2019 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nConference Rounds 1 to 21.\nAll times are local.\nPlay-offs.\n&lt;section begin=Playoffs /&gt;\nThe top side from each of the two conferences are given a bye to the semi-finals and have home advantage.
