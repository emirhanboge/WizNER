    "text": "Isel Hall is an ancient &lt;a href=\"Cumbrian\"&gt;Cumbrian&lt;/a&gt; residence that sits on a steep rise on the northern banks of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Derwent%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;River Derwent&lt;/a&gt;, two miles south of &lt;a href=\"Bassenthwaite%20Lake\"&gt;Bassenthwaite Lake&lt;/a&gt;, three miles east-north-east of &lt;a href=\"Cockermouth\"&gt;Cockermouth&lt;/a&gt;, with views over the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20District\"&gt;Lake District&lt;/a&gt; fells and &lt;a href=\"Skiddaw\"&gt;Skiddaw&lt;/a&gt;. It was once the home of the &lt;a href=\"Lawson%20baronets\"&gt;Lawson&lt;/a&gt; family and is a grade I listed building.\nHistory.\nNorman period.\nThe recorded history of &lt;a href=\"Isel%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Isel&lt;/a&gt; begins during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry II&lt;/a&gt; when Alan, the son of &lt;a href=\"Waltheof%20of%20Allerdale\"&gt;Waltheof&lt;/a&gt;, granted Randulph d'Engayne the &lt;a href=\"demesne\"&gt;demesne&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Isel%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Ishall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redmain%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Redmain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blindcrake\"&gt;Blencrake&lt;/a&gt;. Randulph's granddaughter and heiress Ada married Simon de Morville, lord of the barony of &lt;a href=\"Burgh%20by%20Sands\"&gt;Burgh by Sands&lt;/a&gt;, whose son Hugh left two daughters as coheirs, Ada and Joan. The manor of Isel fell to the elder sister's share. Ada married Richard de Lucy of &lt;a href=\"Egremont%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Egremont&lt;/a&gt;; and later Thomas de Multon, to whom she had a son and heir, Thomas. In the reign of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry III&lt;/a&gt; this Thomas, entailed Isel and Blencrake on his younger son Hubert. Hubert Moulton enjoyed Isel for his lifetime, after which his son William entered the story.\nThe Leigh connection.\nIn 1315, William's daughter Margaret married Sir William de Leigh and this brought Isel into the Leigh family for a period stretching from the reign of &lt;a href=\"Edward%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward II&lt;/a&gt; (1307\u20131327) until 1572. William died in 1354, leaving five sons and two daughters; he is buried beside his horse in Isel churchyard. In the year 1499, one Robert Leigh of Isel assisted Elizabeth Dykes to prosecute an appeal against Thomas Curwen and others for the murder of her husband Alexander Dykes. The award made by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Redman%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;Richard Redmain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bishop%20of%20Exeter\"&gt;bishop of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;; Master &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Urswick\"&gt;Christopher Urswyk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"archdeacon%20of%20Richmond\"&gt;archdeacon of Richmond&lt;/a&gt;; Edward Redmain and Sir Thomas Dykes; stated that:-\nIn 1509, one Sir Edward Redmain possessed Isel, having married, in 1485, the lady Elizabeth, widow of Sir Thomas Leigh, and daughter of Sir John Huddlestone of &lt;a href=\"Millom\"&gt;Millom&lt;/a&gt;. Elizabeth died in 1529, leaving Isel to Sir John Leigh. The &lt;a href=\"Patent%20Rolls\"&gt;Patent Rolls&lt;/a&gt; for 1530 confirm the title. In 1544 john Leigh held the manor of Isel and Blencrake of the King by the service of one knight's fee and the cornage of 46s. 8d. (\u00a32 33p). He was &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;High Sheriff of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; in 1548 and again in 1557; he died in 1563. Thomas Leigh, the last of the name, gave Isel to his second wife, Maud Redmain, who afterwards married for her third husband &lt;a href=\"Wilfred%20Lawson%20%28died%201632%29\"&gt;Wilfred Lawson&lt;/a&gt;, who conveyed the inheritance over to him.\nThe Lawson era.\nThe Lawsons can trace their descent to John Lawson, lord of Fawkegrave, &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; to the early part of the 13th century. Through a long line of eminent ancestors we arrive at &lt;a href=\"Wilfred%20Lawson%20%28died%201632%29\"&gt;Sir Wilfrid Lawson&lt;/a&gt; (1545\u20131632), son of Thomas Lawson (died 1559) of Little &lt;a href=\"Usworth\"&gt;Usworth&lt;/a&gt;, County Durham, and his wife Elizabeth Darrell, daughter of Constantine Darrell of &lt;a href=\"Wiltshire\"&gt;Wiltshire&lt;/a&gt;. He was educated at &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Trinity College, Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; in 1562 and at &lt;a href=\"Gray%27s%20Inn\"&gt;Gray's Inn&lt;/a&gt; in 1564. In 1591 the &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Percy%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland\"&gt;Earl of Northumberland&lt;/a&gt; made him Lieutenant of the Honour of &lt;a href=\"Cockermouth\"&gt;Cockermouth&lt;/a&gt; (Grand Steward of all his estates) and the Conveyor of the &lt;a href=\"Commissioner\"&gt;Commissioner&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Marches\"&gt;Marches&lt;/a&gt;. He was &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;High Sheriff of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; in 1583. In 1593 he was elected Member of Parliament for &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;. He was High Sheriff of Cumberland again in 1597. In 1604, he was elected MP for Cumberland again. He was &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;ed in 1604 and in 1605 was appointed convener to the &lt;a href=\"royal%20commission\"&gt;royal commission&lt;/a&gt; set up to govern the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Scottish%20border\"&gt;Anglo-Scottish border&lt;/a&gt;. He was High Sheriff again in 1606 and in 1612. In 1614 he was elected MP for Cumberland again. Lawson died childless in 1632 at the age of 87 years and was succeeded by his great nephew &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Wilfrid%20Lawson%2C%201st%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Isell\"&gt;Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 1st Baronet, of Isell&lt;/a&gt;.\nSir Wilfred Lawson was an English landowner and politician who sat in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England\"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; from 1660 to 1679. Lawson was born in 1610, the son of William Lawson, and his wife Judith Bewley, daughter of William Bewley of &lt;a href=\"Hesket%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Hesket&lt;/a&gt;. He matriculated at &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;Queen's College, Oxford&lt;/a&gt; on 21 November 1628, aged 17. He was &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;ed by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles I&lt;/a&gt; on 28 February 1641. In 1688, shortly before his death he purchased a &lt;a href=\"baronets\"&gt;baronets&lt;/a&gt; patent from &lt;a href=\"James%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;James II&lt;/a&gt;. He also purchased Brayton from the Salkeld family and settled the family estate at Isel on his grandson Wilfrid (son of his first son William), who subsequently became &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Wilfrid%20Lawson%2C%202nd%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Isell\"&gt;Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet&lt;/a&gt;; and to Wilfrid his second son he conferred the estate of Brayton, so founding the line of 'Brayton' Lawsons.\nSir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet (31 October 1664 \u2013 November 1704) was an English politician. He was the son of William Lawson and inherited his title on the death of his grandfather &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Wilfrid%20Lawson%2C%201st%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Isell\"&gt;Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 1st Baronet, of Isell&lt;/a&gt; in 1688. He married Elizabeth daughter and heir to George Preston of &lt;a href=\"Holker%20Hall\"&gt;Holker Hall&lt;/a&gt;, Lancashire. They had three sons; Wilfrid, William and John. Lawson was &lt;a href=\"High%20Sheriff%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;High Sheriff of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; in 1689, and elected to represent &lt;a href=\"Cockermouth%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Cockermouth&lt;/a&gt; in 1690. On 11 November 1704, Lawson died. He was succeeded by his eldest son &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Wilfrid%20Lawson%2C%203rd%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Isell\"&gt;Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 3rd Baronet, of Isell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sir%20Wilfrid%20Lawson%2C%203rd%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Isell\"&gt;Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 3rd Baronet, of Isell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society\"&gt;FRS&lt;/a&gt; (1697 \u2013 13 July 1737), was a British politician. He was educated &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford\"&gt;Queen's College, Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, graduating in 1713; and was admitted to the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Temple\"&gt;Inner Temple&lt;/a&gt; in 1715. He was &lt;a href=\"Groom%20of%20the%20Bedchamber\"&gt;Groom of the Bedchamber&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;George I&lt;/a&gt; from 1720 to 1725; and was elected as &lt;a href=\"Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society\"&gt;Fellow of the Royal Society&lt;/a&gt; in 1718. He married Elizabeth Lucy, daughter of the Hon. &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Mordaunt\"&gt;Harry Mordaunt&lt;/a&gt; MP and niece of the &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Peterborough\"&gt;Earl of Peterborough&lt;/a&gt;. The marriage produced two sons Wilfrid and Mordaunt and two daughters Elizabeth and Charlotte. He was one of the &lt;a href=\"Lawson%20Baronets\"&gt;Lawson Baronets&lt;/a&gt;, the son and heir of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Wilfrid%20Lawson%2C%202nd%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Isell\"&gt;Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, of Isell&lt;/a&gt;. In 1718, Lawson became Member of Parliament for the &lt;a href=\"Boroughbridge%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Boroughbridge&lt;/a&gt; constituency. In 1722, Lawson was returned for Cockermouth, which he represented until his death. Upon his death at &lt;a href=\"Newcastle-upon-Tyne\"&gt;Newcastle-upon-Tyne&lt;/a&gt; in 1737, he was succeeded by his eldest son, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Wilfrid%20Lawson%2C%204th%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 4th Baronet&lt;/a&gt; (1731\u201339). However, he died in infancy. He was succeeded by his brother Sir Mordaunt Lawson, 5th Baronet (1735\u201343) who also died in infancy; so ending the supremacy of the &lt;a href=\"Isel%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Isel&lt;/a&gt; Lawson's.\nThe residency at Isel after 1743, becomes rather sketchy. We can, with a degree of confidence, assume that branches of the Lawson family continued to live there until the arrival of the Wybergh family in 1806. After this date various members of the Wybergh family are recorded. In 1856, William Wybergh of Isel Hall died; the new owner was his brother John, who in turn was followed by his son, also called John. At the time of her Royal highness the &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Louise%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Argyll\"&gt;Princess Louise&lt;/a&gt; and her husband the &lt;a href=\"John%20Campbell%2C%209th%20Duke%20of%20Argyll\"&gt;Marquis of Lorne&lt;/a&gt; stayed at Isel on their way to open a &lt;a href=\"bazaar\"&gt;bazaar&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Carlisle&lt;/a&gt; in aid of the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland\"&gt;Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hospital\"&gt;Infirmary&lt;/a&gt; in September 1877, they were the guests of &lt;a href=\"Percy%20Wyndham%20%281835%E2%80%931911%29\"&gt;Percy S Wyndham&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20Parliament\"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1891 &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Wilfrid%20Lawson%2C%203rd%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Brayton\"&gt;Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 3rd Baronet, of Brayton&lt;/a&gt; (21 October 1862 \u2013 28 August 1937), an English Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1910 to 1916 took over the estate. He remained at Isel until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by his nephew &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Hilton%20Lawson%2C%204th%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir Hilton Lawson, 4th Baronet&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern day.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Hilton%20Lawson%2C%204th%20Baronet\"&gt;Sir Hilton Lawson, 4th Baronet&lt;/a&gt;, Isel Hall was sold by private sale to Margaret Austin-Leigh of &lt;a href=\"Fareham\"&gt;Fareham&lt;/a&gt;, Hampshire, a first cousin of the previous owner. Margaret was the daughter of Lucy Thurston and granddaughter to &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Wilfrid%20Lawson%2C%202nd%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Brayton\"&gt;Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, of Brayton&lt;/a&gt;. In 1941, Margaret married Richard Austen-Leigh, the great nephew of &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Austen\"&gt;Jane Austen&lt;/a&gt; through her brother, Henry's marriage. He was a publisher, &lt;a href=\"Printer%20%28publishing%29\"&gt;printer&lt;/a&gt; and writer, who had revised the edited works of Jane Austen. He died in 1961. During Margaret's time at Isel she bred &lt;a href=\"Shetland%20pony\"&gt;Shetland ponies&lt;/a&gt; and large &lt;a href=\"Poodle\"&gt;Poodle&lt;/a&gt; dogs.\nMargaret had no children and upon her death in 1986 she left Isel to her friend and distant relative Mary Burkett &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire\"&gt;OBE&lt;/a&gt;. Mary had recently retired from a distinguished career as &lt;a href=\"Curator\"&gt;director&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20Hall%20Art%20Gallery\"&gt;Abbot Hall Art gallery and Museum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kendal\"&gt;Kendal&lt;/a&gt;. At Abbot Hall she won the first award for Best museum of the Year, had served on committees of the &lt;a href=\"Arts%20Council%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Arts Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crafts%20Council\"&gt;Crafts Council&lt;/a&gt; and served as member of a visiting team of &lt;a href=\"Curator\"&gt;Museum Directors&lt;/a&gt; who had visited the United States in 1981 in an advisory role. Mary compiled a memoir of a former &lt;a href=\"Maid\"&gt;parlour maid&lt;/a&gt; at Isel Hall, Miss May Moore (I Was Only A Maid \u2013 the life of a remarkable woman, Firpress Ltd., Workington), who also featured in a &lt;a href=\"ITV%20Border\"&gt;Border TV&lt;/a&gt; documentary filmed at the Hall in 1997. Mary carried out, with the help of &lt;a href=\"English%20Heritage\"&gt;English Heritage&lt;/a&gt; many improvements to the fabric of the building, with special attention to the Pele Tower, the terrace and the sunken garden. Miss Burkett passed away in late 2014, leaving the house to its current owners.\nThe Site.\nThe edifice stands on a curious, almost unique, site on the north side of the River Derwent. Such a position at first sight appears contrary to all precedents, for whenever there is a stream in the vicinity we invariably find an English &lt;a href=\"Pele%20tower\"&gt;Pele tower&lt;/a&gt; placed on the southern bank, so as to interpose the river between it and the northern enemy. However, the geography of the region today is somewhat different from that of the medieval period. There existed at that time a dense impenetrable forest between &lt;a href=\"Isel%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Isel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uldale\"&gt;Uldale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wigton\"&gt;Wigton&lt;/a&gt; with no roads through for the marauding &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20people\"&gt;Scots&lt;/a&gt; to descend. Their only way would be by the old &lt;a href=\"Roman%20roads%20in%20Britain\"&gt;Roman road&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria\"&gt;Carlisle&lt;/a&gt; and Wigton to &lt;a href=\"Cockermouth\"&gt;Cockermouth&lt;/a&gt;, or else by &lt;a href=\"galley\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Dumfries\"&gt;Dumfries&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Allonby\"&gt;Allonby&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Flimby\"&gt;Flimby&lt;/a&gt;, and then up the Derwent valley. Isel, therefore could only be reached from the south, hence the Hall is situated in the correct position. The site is further protected by a woodland stream running around the north and the west sides. It is called the Bloomer Beck, which suggests that it may have been the site a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Smelting\"&gt;iron smelter&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nPele tower.\nThe most striking feature of Isel Hall is the Pele Tower, which together with the Great Hall is one of the oldest parts of the building. The exact age remains unclear. We know that in the year 1387 an army of &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20people\"&gt;Scots&lt;/a&gt; under the banners of the dukes of Douglas and Fife raided and captured &lt;a href=\"Cockermouth%20Castle\"&gt;Cockermouth Castle&lt;/a&gt;, and laid waste to the surrounding countryside. The present building most probably dates to a time shortly after this occurrence. Unfortunately there are no records to authenticate the date of erection of the Pele Tower. Although both the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crown\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Warden%20of%20the%20Marches\"&gt;Warden of the Marches&lt;/a&gt; granted such licenses, no public records relating to the proceedings of the latter are available for collaboration. There is however one &lt;a href=\"Architecture\"&gt;architectural&lt;/a&gt; feature to offer a clue to the period. This is a Carnarvon arched doorway in the basement of the tower. It is a wide doorway writes Curwen, so it could be a late example and places the tower in the early fifteenth century. The tower consists of the customary vaulted basement with three stories over. It is rectangular shaped and of medium size, measuring externally 13 metres by 7.75 metres on a north\u2013south axis. The masonry is of &lt;a href=\"Freestone%20%28masonry%29\"&gt;freestone&lt;/a&gt; rubble with red &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; dressings to the sixteenth century windows. There is no &lt;a href=\"plinth\"&gt;plinth&lt;/a&gt; or offset of any kind, although the &lt;a href=\"parapet\"&gt;parapet&lt;/a&gt; ejects beyond the face of the wall. The height is 13 metres and the walls are 2 metres thick. The basement is &lt;a href=\"barrel%20vault\"&gt;barrel vault&lt;/a&gt;ed, and divided by a cross wall, in which is the previously mentioned Carnarvon arched doorway. The three floors above are reached by short flights of stairs and passages. On the top floor are two light windows with square heads and drip stones in common with the period of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt;. To this tower, but not in axis, the owner added a domestic range. This addition has no windows.\nThe Grand Hall.\nThe later wing, also started in the 16th century, protruding in a westerly direction, is about 38 metres in length. It has a gable-roof and a plain parapet relieved on both fronts at intervals by small open stone arches surmounted by short pinnacles and having the form of a &lt;a href=\"Spur%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;prick spur&lt;/a&gt;. The wing is lighted by rows of square &lt;a href=\"mullion\"&gt;mullion&lt;/a&gt;ed windows which have red sandstone dressed &lt;a href=\"Quoin%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;quoins&lt;/a&gt;, and above the windows over the doorway is a square tablet enclosing a weather-worn &lt;a href=\"coat%20of%20arms\"&gt;coat of arms&lt;/a&gt;. Projecting from this wing was a further wing, now gone, balancing the Pele Tower to form an open courtyard.\nThe owner built the earliest part of this extended wing in the early part of the 16th century; it comprised a &lt;a href=\"Banquet\"&gt;banqueting hall&lt;/a&gt;, looking towards the south, together with a new entrance hall with bedrooms over. The banqueting hall, occupied the space of the present dining room, study, and passage, and measured 12.2 metres by 7.3 metres. Four very wide and richly moulded beams span the ceiling, while laid across these are smaller moulded ribs to support the above floors. The beautiful &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20architecture\"&gt;Tudor&lt;/a&gt; panelling surrounding this block of rooms is one of the most interesting features of the hall. We find the Lawson arms, inlaid, above the doorway of the present study; while the adjoining panels are ornamented in colour with different devices and figures.\nThe Fa\u00e7ade.\nThe fa\u00e7ade of the Hall is another peculiar feature which calls for attention. The line of the &lt;a href=\"eaves\"&gt;eaves&lt;/a&gt; is broken at regular intervals by a form of ornament superimposed upon the top of the wall and of which only one parallel example exists, that is at &lt;a href=\"Hardwick%20Hall\"&gt;Hardwick Hall&lt;/a&gt; in Derbyshire. The principal ornament consists of an open arch rib with the feet sunk lightly below the eaves but which rise up clear of the slates being surmounted on the crown by a terminal. At intermediate distances somewhat smaller ones occur, but in these the arch is not pierced, neither do the feet penetrate into the wall.\nSale of interior property.\nIn July 1960 the &lt;a href=\"auction\"&gt;auction&lt;/a&gt;eers erected an enormous &lt;a href=\"Pole%20marquee\"&gt;marquee&lt;/a&gt; on the terrace lawn outside of the front door of Isel Hall, overlooking the River Derwent. The three-day sale, comprising 1,071 lots, filled 30 pages of the sale &lt;a href=\"Auction%20catalog\"&gt;catalogue&lt;/a&gt;. There were 20 lots of metal ware, 37 of &lt;a href=\"plated%20ware\"&gt;plated ware&lt;/a&gt;, 109 of silver, 264 of furniture, 34 of &lt;a href=\"carpets\"&gt;carpets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carpet\"&gt;rugs&lt;/a&gt;, 66 of &lt;a href=\"Tableware\"&gt;china&lt;/a&gt; and glass, and many more of &lt;a href=\"paintings\"&gt;paintings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"curtain\"&gt;curtain&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"books\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"linen\"&gt;linen&lt;/a&gt;. One may gain an understanding of the work of the linen maids in the great &lt;a href=\"English%20country%20house\"&gt;country houses&lt;/a&gt; by studying the content of the catalogue. Almost 300 lots of linen came under the hammer, including 31 &lt;a href=\"tablecloths\"&gt;tablecloths&lt;/a&gt;, 60 linen sheets, 90 table &lt;a href=\"napkins\"&gt;napkins&lt;/a&gt;, and over 200 &lt;a href=\"towels\"&gt;towels&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough dealers attended from all over the country and from abroad the majority of the items went to local people. The highest price paid was \u00a3300 for an &lt;a href=\"Inlay\"&gt;inlaid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mahogany\"&gt;mahogany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"George%20Hepplewhite\"&gt;Hepplewhite&lt;/a&gt; break front &lt;a href=\"bookcase\"&gt;bookcase&lt;/a&gt;, the top enclosed by two central and two side &lt;a href=\"astragal\"&gt;astragal&lt;/a&gt; glass doors.

The painting, considered a copy of an almost identical painting hanging in the &lt;a href=\"Palazzo%20Pitti\"&gt;pitti Palace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Three%20Ages%20of%20Man%20%28Giorgione%29\"&gt;Three Ages of Man&lt;/a&gt; is arguably the work of Italian painter &lt;a href=\"Giorgione\"&gt;Giorgione&lt;/a&gt;. The unnamed buyer paid the paltry sum of \u00a3200. Within a year, John Harrington, an American multi millionaire &lt;a href=\"Private%20collection\"&gt;art collector&lt;/a&gt;, had purchased the painting from an &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; auction saleroom. Harrington would dedicate the next 30 years of his life travelling the art houses of the world trying to prove that the painting is an authentic masterpiece."
