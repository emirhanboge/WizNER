    "text": " runs parallel to the west bank of the &lt;a href=\"Kamo%20River\"&gt;Kamo River&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern side of &lt;a href=\"Kyoto\"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. Its intersection with &lt;a href=\"Shijo%20%28Kyoto%29\"&gt;Shij\u014d Street&lt;/a&gt; is called &lt;a href=\"Shij%C5%8D%20Kawaramachi\"&gt;Shij\u014d Kawaramachi&lt;/a&gt; and is a leading shopping district of the city.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"Shijo%20%28Kyoto%29\"&gt;Shij\u014d&lt;/a&gt; and Kawaramachi Street are protected with &lt;a href=\"smoking%20ban\"&gt;smoking ban&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOverview.\nEdo Period.\nLocated outside of &lt;a href=\"Heian-ky%C5%8D\"&gt;Heian-ky\u014d&lt;/a&gt; and runs almost parallel to Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Odoi. It is thought that it was established when the city expanded to the Kamo River in the early Edo Period.\nFrom north to south it extends from Aoibashi Nishizume to Juj\u014d Street. North of Aoibashi Nishizume its name changes to Shimogamo Main Street. South of Juj\u014d Street it curves along the Kamo River and joins together with Kuzebashi Street. The stretch between &lt;a href=\"Sanj%C5%8D%20Street\"&gt;Sanj\u014d Street&lt;/a&gt; and Shij\u014d Street is one of Kyoto's downtown shopping streets. \nBecause the portion between Shij\u014d Street and Kamijuzuyacho Street runs parallel to the Kamo River bending in a North-North-East and South-South-West direction it naturally intersects with North-South running Teramachi Street and Gokomachi Street.\nHistory.\nIt is not clear when the excavation began of the eastern end of Heikan-kyo and inner eastern side of Odoi but because Odoi was runs along Kawaramachi Street's western side it is thought to be after the creation of Kawaramachi.
