    "text": "Kurultai (&lt;a href=\"Mongolian%20language\"&gt;Mongolian&lt;/a&gt;: , \u0425\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0439, \"Khuraldai\"; &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20languages\"&gt;Turkic&lt;/a&gt;: \"Kurultay\") was a political and military council of ancient &lt;a href=\"Mongols\"&gt;Mongol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20peoples\"&gt;Turkic&lt;/a&gt; chiefs and &lt;a href=\"Khan%20%28title%29\"&gt;khans&lt;/a&gt;. The root of the word is Proto-Mongolic *\"kura-\", *\"kurija-\" \"to collect, to gather\" from which is formed \"khural\" meaning \"meeting\" or \"assembly\" in &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20languages\"&gt;Turkic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mongolian%20language\"&gt;Mongolian language&lt;/a&gt;s. \"Khuraldai\", \"khuruldai\" or \"khuraldaan\" means \"gathering\" or, more literally, \"intergatheration\". From this same root arises the Mongolian word \u0445\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043c (\"khurim\"), which means \"feast\" and originally referred to large festive gatherings on the steppe but is used mainly in the sense of \"wedding\" in modern times.\nMongol Empire.\nAll Great Khans of the &lt;a href=\"Mongol%20Empire\"&gt;Mongol Empire&lt;/a&gt;, for example &lt;a href=\"Genghis%20Khan\"&gt;Genghis Khan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%96gedei%20Khan\"&gt;\u00d6gedei Khan&lt;/a&gt;, were formally elected in a \"Kurultai\"; khans of subordinate Mongol states, such as the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Horde\"&gt;Golden Horde&lt;/a&gt;, were elected by a similar regional Kurultai.\nDuring the Kurultai, Mongol Chiefs would all convene in order to choose the next Great Khan. The Kurultai, oftentimes but not always held in the capital of the Mongolian empire, were also a time to assign all critical positions of leadership as well as an opportunity to decide the militaristic direction to be implemented under the new Khan and aforementioned new leadership.\nAfter the new khan has been elected, an elaborate enthronement procedure followed. &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Schiltberger\"&gt;Johann Schiltberger&lt;/a&gt;, a 15th-century German traveler, described the installation of a new Golden Horde khan as follows\n(quoted in):\nRussian princes and &lt;a href=\"boyar\"&gt;boyar&lt;/a&gt;s, who often had to wait in &lt;a href=\"Sarai%20%28city%29\"&gt;Sarai&lt;/a&gt; for the Kurultai to elect a new khan, who would then re-issue their &lt;a href=\"yarlyk\"&gt;yarlyk&lt;/a&gt;s (patents), would no doubt often witness this \"khan kutermiak\" rituals, which became increasingly more frequent and futile during the mid-14th-century time of troubles in the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, giving rise to the Russian word \"\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044c\u043c\u0430\" (\"kuter'ma\"), meaning \"running around pointlessly\".\nKurultai were imperial and tribal assemblies convened to determine, strategize and analyze military campaigns and assign individuals to leadership positions and titles. &lt;a href=\"Genghis%20Khan\"&gt;Genghis Khan&lt;/a&gt; was declared &lt;a href=\"Khan%20%28title%29\"&gt;Khan&lt;/a&gt; in the Kurultai of 1206 CE. Most of the major military campaigns were first planned out at assemblies such as this and there were minor and less significant Kurultai under the Mongol Empire under political subordinate leaders and generals.\nThe Kurultai, however, required the presence of the senior members of the tribes participating, who were also military leaders. Thus, the deaths of &lt;a href=\"%C3%96gedei%20Khan\"&gt;\u00d6gedei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M%C3%B6ngke%20Khan\"&gt;M\u00f6ngke&lt;/a&gt; in 1241 CE and 1259 CE, respectively, necessitated the withdrawal of Mongol leaders (and troops) from the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; (in 1241) and from &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; (in 1259), hamstringing military operations against the Austrians and &lt;a href=\"Mamluk\"&gt;Mamluk&lt;/a&gt;s that might otherwise have continued.\nAlthough the Kurultai was a serious political event in the Mongol world, it was also a festival of sorts including great feasting and various traditional games. Many of these traditions have been carried on in the modern-day Mongolian event &lt;a href=\"Naadam\"&gt;Naadam&lt;/a&gt;, which includes &lt;a href=\"Mongolian%20wrestling\"&gt;Mongolian wrestling&lt;/a&gt;, horse racing and archery competitions.\nModern usage.\nVarious modern &lt;a href=\"Mongols\"&gt;Mongol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turkic%20peoples\"&gt;Turkic peoples&lt;/a&gt; use it in the political or administrative sense, as a synonym for &lt;a href=\"parliament\"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"congress\"&gt;congress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Meeting\"&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Local%20Government\"&gt;council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deliberative%20assembly\"&gt;assembly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Convention%20%28meeting%29\"&gt;convention&lt;/a&gt;, gathering. Examples are: the &lt;a href=\"The%20World%20Qoroltai%20of%20the%20Bashkirs\"&gt;World Qoroltai of the Bashkirs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qurultay%20of%20the%20Crimean%20Tatar%20People\"&gt;Qurultay of the Crimean Tatar People&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Council%20%28Kyrgyzstan%29\"&gt;National Kurultai of Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"State%20Great%20Khural\"&gt;State Great Khural of Mongolia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Khural%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Buryatia\"&gt;People's Khural of Buryatia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"State%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Altai%20Republic\"&gt;El Kurultai of Altai Republic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Great%20Kurult%C3%A1j\"&gt;Kurult\u00e1j&lt;/a&gt; held today in Hungary.\nIn Mongolian, the following forms of the word are still in use today: \"khuraldai\", \"khuraldaan\" and \"khural\". \"Ulsin Deed Shuukhiin Khuraldaan\" means \"session of the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20Mongolia\"&gt;National Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOther spellings include: \"kurultay\", \"qurultay\", \"qur\u0131ltai\", \"qor\u0131ltay\", and \"qoroltay\".\nThe word has several modern usages in the modern &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20language\"&gt;Turkish language&lt;/a&gt; as well, e.g. \"Y\u00fcksek\u00f6\u011fretim Kurulu\" \"&lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Higher%20Education%20%28Turkey%29\"&gt;Higher Education Council&lt;/a&gt;\", \"genel kurul toplant\u0131s\u0131\" \"general board meeting\". \"Kurultay\" is also a commonly-used word in modern Turkish meaning \"general assembly\", such as for organisations, committees etc. \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.turkishdictionary.net/%3Fword%3Dkurulmak\"&gt;Kurulmak&lt;/a&gt;\" is also a verb in Turkish meaning \"to be established\". It is also used for \"extraordinary conventions\" () of political parties."
