    "text": "Jo\u00ebl Cloarec (born 5 February 1966) is a French &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; manager and former player who is the head coach of French club &lt;a href=\"La%20Vitr%C3%A9enne%20FC\"&gt;La Vitr\u00e9enne&lt;/a&gt;. As a player, he was a &lt;a href=\"Forward%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nCloarec made his first steps as a pro with &lt;a href=\"US%20Concarneau\"&gt;Concarneau&lt;/a&gt; in 1984. He would go on to play for the club until 1986, when he joined fellow &lt;a href=\"Brittany\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Brestois%2029\"&gt;Brest&lt;/a&gt;. In 1991, Cloarec left Brest to sign for &lt;a href=\"LB%20Ch%C3%A2teauroux\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teauroux&lt;/a&gt;, where he would spend a season before joining &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.\"&gt;Paris Saint-Germain&lt;/a&gt; (PSG). At PSG, he was a victim of tough competition, and he only played one minute the entire season, as he was substituted on for &lt;a href=\"David%20Ginola\"&gt;David Ginola&lt;/a&gt; during a 2\u20131 &lt;a href=\"Ligue%201\"&gt;Division 1&lt;/a&gt; victory away to &lt;a href=\"AS%20Saint-%C3%89tienne\"&gt;Saint-\u00c9tienne&lt;/a&gt; on 8 August 1992. He holds the record for the shortest amount of time played for PSG. After the end of the 1992\u201393 season, Cloarec was sent out on loan to &lt;a href=\"Valenciennes%20FC\"&gt;Valenciennes&lt;/a&gt;, where he played 38 league games in the &lt;a href=\"Ligue%202\"&gt;Division 2&lt;/a&gt;. Following his loan stint, he returned to Paris, but the PSG manager at the time, &lt;a href=\"Artur%20Jorge%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201946%29\"&gt;Artur Jorge&lt;/a&gt;, decided not to keep him; therefore, he returned to his native Brittany to play for &lt;a href=\"En%20Avant%20Guingamp\"&gt;Guingamp&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1996, Cloarec signed for Guingamp's neighbors &lt;a href=\"Stade%20Briochin\"&gt;Stade Briochin&lt;/a&gt;. After just a season in &lt;a href=\"Saint-Brieuc\"&gt;Saint-Brieuc&lt;/a&gt;, he moved on to &lt;a href=\"AS%20Vitr%C3%A9\"&gt;Vitr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, the club at which he would eventually retire in 2002.\nInternational career.\nCloarec played one match for &lt;a href=\"Brittany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Brittany national team&lt;/a&gt; in 1988. He scored one of the goals in a 6\u20132 victory over in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in an indoor setting.\nPost-playing career.\nFrom 2000 to 2002, Cloarec was a &lt;a href=\"player-manager\"&gt;player-manager&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"AS%20Vitr%C3%A9\"&gt;Vitr\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;. In 2002, he retired from football to take on the full role of manager at the club, a role in which he would stay in until 2011. Cloarec coached Vitr\u00e9 to two Coupe de France round of 16 appearances \u2013 one in &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Coupe%20de%20France\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; and another in &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Coupe%20de%20France\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;. In 2011, he became the head coach of &lt;a href=\"ES%20Bonchamp\"&gt;Bonchamp&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 2013\u201314 season, Cloarec was the manager of &lt;a href=\"La%20Vitr%C3%A9enne%20FC\"&gt;La Vitr\u00e9enne&lt;/a&gt;. However, he left that role at the end of the season to become a youth coach for the club. In 2016, after two years as a youth coach, he returned to manage the first team for one season. In the 2017\u201318 season, Cloarec held the position of assistant manager in the first team of La Vitr\u00e9enne, while simultaneously being the club's &lt;a href=\"sporting%20director\"&gt;sporting director&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, he stopped being assistant manager in order to be solely the sporting director. In 2020, after two years as sporting director, Cloarec returned to coach La Vitr\u00e9enne.\nHonours.\nManager.\nVitr\u00e9"
