    "text": "The Aquarius 24 Pilot Cutter, also called the Aquarius Pilot Cutter 24, Aquarius 24 Cutter and the Topsail Pilot Cutter, is an American &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20sailer\"&gt;trailerable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt; that was designed by &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Parish\"&gt;Frank Parish&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Cruising%20%28maritime%29\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and first built in 1979. The design was based upon a &lt;a href=\"Lyle%20C.%20Hess\"&gt;Lyle C. Hess&lt;/a&gt; sailboat.\nProduction.\nThe design was built by &lt;a href=\"Top%20Sail%20Yachts%20Inc.\"&gt;Top Sail Yachts Inc.&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Portsmouth%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Portsmouth, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The company built 33 of the boats from 1979 to 1984, but it is now out of production.\nDesign.\nThe Aquarius 24 Pilot Cutter was intended as a limited production ocean cruising boat and was inspired by 19th century working boat designs. The design goals were ease of handling, comfort and safety.\nThe design is a recreational &lt;a href=\"keelboat\"&gt;keelboat&lt;/a&gt;, built predominantly of hand-laid solid &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt; with polyester resin, with wood trim. The deck and coach house are made from fiberglass cored marine &lt;a href=\"plywood\"&gt;plywood&lt;/a&gt;. It has a &lt;a href=\"cutter%20rig\"&gt;cutter rig&lt;/a&gt; rig with a &lt;a href=\"Gunter%20rig\"&gt;Gunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"topsail\"&gt;topsail&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gaff%20rig\"&gt;gaff rig&lt;/a&gt; optional. Spars are all &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt;. It has a spooned &lt;a href=\"plumb%20stem\"&gt;plumb stem&lt;/a&gt;, an angled &lt;a href=\"Transom%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;transom&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt;-mounted &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"tiller\"&gt;tiller&lt;/a&gt;, a wooden &lt;a href=\"bowsprit\"&gt;bowsprit&lt;/a&gt;, a \"V\" shaped &lt;a href=\"boomkin\"&gt;boomkin&lt;/a&gt; and a fixed long keel. Although described as a trailerable boat, it displaces and carries of lead encapsulated ballast. The trailering weight is estimated to be .\nEven though the hull length is , with the &lt;a href=\"bowsprit\"&gt;bowsprit&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;length overall&lt;/a&gt; is or for the gaff-rigged model, as it has a longer bowsprit.\nThe boat has a draft of with the standard keel.\nThe boat is fitted with a Swedish &lt;a href=\"Volvo\"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; MD 7 &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt; of for docking and maneuvering. It could also be fitted with a small &lt;a href=\"outboard%20motor\"&gt;outboard motor&lt;/a&gt; and at least some were so equipped.\nThe design was factory delivered with a choice of at least four different interior arrangements and each boat was custom finished. Each of these layouts has sleeping accommodation for six people, with a double slant berth in the bow cabin, a \"U\"-shaped settee or aft berth on the port side in the main cabin and an aft cabin with a double berth on the starboard side. The &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; is located amidships on the starboard side. The &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is located just aft of the bow cabin on the starboard side. Cabin headroom is and the fresh water tank has a capacity of .\nThe design was sold as a \"character boat\", with features that were reminiscent of the late 19th century, such as ten opening bronze ports as well as bronze turnbuckles, chainplates and &lt;a href=\"winch\"&gt;winch&lt;/a&gt;es, as well as &lt;a href=\"tanbark\"&gt;tanbark&lt;/a&gt; sails. For sailing the design is equipped with &lt;a href=\"lazyjacks\"&gt;lazyjacks&lt;/a&gt;, with all lines led to the cockpit.\nThe design has a &lt;a href=\"Performance%20Handicap%20Racing%20Fleet\"&gt;PHRF&lt;/a&gt; racing average handicap of 258 and a &lt;a href=\"hull%20speed\"&gt;hull speed&lt;/a&gt; of .\nOperational history.\nThe boat is supported by an active class club, the \"Aquarius Pilot Cutters Owners Group\".\nIn a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, \"this is a compact character boat conceived in the 1970s, but designed to look like something from the 1920s or 1930s, and having the same general characteristics: heavy scantlings, lots of bronze hardware ... and tanbark sails ... Her displacement of 8,900 lbs. is more than any of her comp[etitor]s by over 10 percent and stretches the limit of practicality for a 24-foot boat, so her comp[etitor]s are probably all better performers in light air.\"\nA review in \"Blue Water Boats\" noted that the boats are \"overbuilt\", \"with a hull thickness varying from 3/8\u201d at the minimum to 5/8\" at the turn of the bilge and as much as 3/4\" in the keel sections\"."
