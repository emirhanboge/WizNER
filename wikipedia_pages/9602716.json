    "text": "The 2007 South Pacific Games were held in &lt;a href=\"Apia\"&gt;Apia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samoa\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt;, from 25 August to 8 September 2007. The Games were the thirteenth to be held since the inception of the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Games\"&gt;South Pacific Games&lt;/a&gt; in 1963, and included traditional &lt;a href=\"multi-sport%20event\"&gt;multi-sport event&lt;/a&gt; disciplines, such as &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"swimming%20%28sport%29\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, alongside region-specific and smaller events such as &lt;a href=\"outrigger%20canoe\"&gt;outrigger canoe&lt;/a&gt;ing, &lt;a href=\"surfing\"&gt;surfing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lawn%20bowls\"&gt;lawn bowls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe principal venue for the Games was &lt;a href=\"Apia%20Park\"&gt;Apia Park&lt;/a&gt;, with other events taking place at the &lt;a href=\"Tuanaimato\"&gt;Faleata Sporting Complex&lt;/a&gt; and at other locations around Samoa. The cost of the games was reported to be &lt;a href=\"US%24\"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;92 million, and resulted in significant &lt;a href=\"government%20debt\"&gt;government debt&lt;/a&gt; for Samoa due to &lt;a href=\"public%20works\"&gt;infrastructure projects&lt;/a&gt; which included replacement bridges and roads.\nSports.\nThere were 33 sports contested at this edition of the games:\nOpening ceremony.\nThe &lt;a href=\"opening%20ceremony\"&gt;opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt; took place on 25 August 2007 at &lt;a href=\"Apia%20Park%20Stadium\"&gt;Apia Park Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and was performed in a traditional Samoan and Pacific style, welcoming some 5,000 athletes from 22 nations and territories to Samoa.\nThe ceremony was attended by &lt;a href=\"Tuilaepa%20Aiono%20Sailele%20Malielegaoi\"&gt;Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister of Samoa (who also competed in the Games - \"see &lt;a href=\"2007%20Pacific%20Games%23Participation%20by%20Samoan%20Prime%20Minister\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;\"), and &lt;a href=\"Tuiatua%20Tupua%20Tamasese%20Efi\"&gt;Tuiatua Tupua Tamasese Efi&lt;/a&gt;, Head of State. Choreographed by Samoan contemporary dancer &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Aiolupotea\"&gt;Alan Aiolupotea&lt;/a&gt; the ceremony featured dancing portraying the \"mystical legends\" from Samoa's island heritage (such as the stories of \"&lt;a href=\"Sina%20and%20the%20Eel\"&gt;Sina and the Eel&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Nafanua\"&gt;Nafanua&lt;/a&gt;\") with a five-year-old female &lt;a href=\"Fire%20dancing\"&gt;fire dancer&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Siumu\"&gt;Siumu Village&lt;/a&gt; performing a \"&lt;a href=\"siva%20afi\"&gt;siva afi&lt;/a&gt;\" (or &lt;a href=\"Devil%20stick%23Fire%20devil%20sticks\"&gt;fire stick&lt;/a&gt; dance) accompanied by a Samoan song depicting the &lt;a href=\"lava%20flow\"&gt;flow of lava&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Savai%27i\"&gt;1905 eruptions near Savai'i&lt;/a&gt; being one of the showcase displays.\nFormer &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Idol\"&gt;New Zealand Idol&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href=\"Rosita%20Vai\"&gt;Rosita Vai&lt;/a&gt; sang an accompaniment to the &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; lighting of the ceremonial flame by &lt;a href=\"Ofisa%20Ofisa\"&gt;Ofisa Ofisa&lt;/a&gt;, a Samoan &lt;a href=\"Olympic%20weightlifting\"&gt;weightlifter&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing a rest day on Sunday, the sporting events of the Games began on Monday, 27 August.\nParticipation by Samoan Prime Minister.\nSamoan Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Tuilaepa%20Aiono%20Sailele%20Malielegaoi\"&gt;Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi&lt;/a&gt; competed for his country at the Games in the sport of &lt;a href=\"target%20archery\"&gt;target archery&lt;/a&gt;. In participating in the Games, the Prime Minister became the first \"elected\" leader to represent his country at a &lt;a href=\"multi-sport%20event\"&gt;multi-sport event&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving taken up the sport only 5 months prior to the Games, Tuilaepa was ranked second in Samoa in the \"combined bow\" discipline. The Prime Minister's son was also a reserve team member.\nOn day 10 of the Games, Tuilaepa won a &lt;a href=\"silver%20medal\"&gt;silver medal&lt;/a&gt; in the \"mixed &lt;a href=\"recurve%20bow\"&gt;recurve&lt;/a&gt; team play\" event.\nLogistical problems.\nProblems with equipment and the lack of multi-sport event infrastructures within the region created difficulties throughout the Games.\nThe &lt;a href=\"decathlon\"&gt;decathlon&lt;/a&gt; was reduced to eight disciplines due to a shortage of equipment. The poles for the &lt;a href=\"pole%20vault\"&gt;pole vault&lt;/a&gt; were still in &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; after the ship due to deliver them was delayed by poor weather and the &lt;a href=\"high%20jump\"&gt;high jump&lt;/a&gt; was the discipline cancelled to allow the event to comply with &lt;a href=\"IAAF\"&gt;IAAF&lt;/a&gt; regulations (there is no IAAF-sanctioned nine discipline event). In addition, the 1500 metre race was reduced to 1\u00a0km. The women's 400-metre &lt;a href=\"hurdles\"&gt;hurdles&lt;/a&gt; and men's &lt;a href=\"discus\"&gt;discus&lt;/a&gt; were also affected.\nThe lack of funding and facilities for drug testing also restricted the ability of Games authorities to run a full drug testing and anti-&lt;a href=\"doping%20%28sport%29\"&gt;doping&lt;/a&gt; programme at the Games. Only one hundred athletes (primarily in high-risk events such as &lt;a href=\"bodybuilding\"&gt;bodybuilding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Powerlifting\"&gt;weightlifting&lt;/a&gt;) were due to be tested as samples needed to be flown overseas from Samoa to be processed at a cost of &lt;a href=\"Australian%20dollar\"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;500 per sample.\n&lt;a href=\"Fireworks\"&gt;Fireworks&lt;/a&gt; due to feature in the &lt;a href=\"Closing%20Ceremony\"&gt;Closing Ceremony&lt;/a&gt; also remained in Melbourne after difficulties transporting them by ship to Samoa.\nReligious controversies.\nThe religious sensitivities of the host nation (which is primarily &lt;a href=\"Congregational%20church\"&gt;Congregationalist Christian&lt;/a&gt;) and other participants resulted in several controversial decisions during the organisation and running of the Games.\nAthletes in the women's &lt;a href=\"beach%20volleyball\"&gt;beach volleyball&lt;/a&gt; event were required to wear shorts and T-shirts as opposed to the regulation &lt;a href=\"bikini\"&gt;bikini&lt;/a&gt;-style outfits to avoid offending family members and other spectators.\nA leaked internal memo by &lt;a href=\"Sport%20in%20Samoa\"&gt;Team Samoa&lt;/a&gt; authorities was circulated prior to the event warning Samoan athletes not to engage in &lt;a href=\"homosexual\"&gt;homosexual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sexual%20intercourse\"&gt;intercourse&lt;/a&gt; declaring it as \"ungodly\", stating: \"do not embarrass yourself, your family and your country by trying this in the village...Best not to even think about this. It's against the law of God!\" Such activity is prohibited under Samoan law and punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. However, the ban on homosexual intercourse was later lifted by organising committee chairman &lt;a href=\"Tapasu%20Lueng%20Wai\"&gt;Tapasu Lueng Wai&lt;/a&gt;.\nA campaign to issue athletes &lt;a href=\"condoms\"&gt;condoms&lt;/a&gt; and advice on &lt;a href=\"sexually%20transmitted%20infection\"&gt;sexually transmitted infection&lt;/a&gt;s also met with resistance from religious leaders. The Archbishop of the Catholic Church in Samoa, &lt;a href=\"Alapati%20Mataeliga\"&gt;Alapati Mataeliga&lt;/a&gt; suggested that, in doing so, the authorities were encouraging &lt;a href=\"Extramarital%20sex\"&gt;extra-marital sexual activity&lt;/a&gt; which was frowned upon by the church. Games authorities also back-tracked on plans to issue athletes with &lt;a href=\"female%20condom\"&gt;female condom&lt;/a&gt;s after fears it might \"expose young athletes to sex.\" Male condoms were nevertheless distributed.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony for the Games again took place at Apia Park. Attended by some 20,000 spectators, a twelve-minute fireworks display brought proceedings to an end before hundreds of &lt;a href=\"balloon\"&gt;balloon&lt;/a&gt;s were released in the colours of the Games flag which was itself duly lowered and the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20flame\"&gt;ceremonial flame&lt;/a&gt; extinguished.\nThe flag was then passed to &lt;a href=\"New%20Caledonia\"&gt;New Caledonia&lt;/a&gt; delegates, supported by a &lt;a href=\"Kanak%20people\"&gt;Kanak&lt;/a&gt; cultural group, ahead of the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Pacific%20Games\"&gt;2011 Pacific Games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Noumea\"&gt;Noumea&lt;/a&gt;.\nVenues.\nA significant amount of the pre-Games expenditure was spent on building new facilities and upgrading those already in existence in Samoa. The majority of the new facilities were sited at the &lt;a href=\"Tuanaimato\"&gt;Faleata Sports Complex&lt;/a&gt; at Tuana'imato. However, many Samoans feared the size of the complex and other construction would lead to the venues becoming significant &lt;a href=\"white%20elephant\"&gt;white elephant&lt;/a&gt;s after the Games were over.\nFinal medal table.\nNew Caledonia topped the medal count."
