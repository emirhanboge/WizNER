    "text": "Ibrox Park was a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; ground in &lt;a href=\"Ibrox%2C%20Glasgow\"&gt;Ibrox&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland. It was the home ground of &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; from 1887 until they moved to the adjacent &lt;a href=\"Ibrox%20Stadium\"&gt;second Ibrox&lt;/a&gt; in 1899. The ground staged the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;Scottish Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; four times and also three &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; international matches.\nHistory.\nRangers' previous ground at &lt;a href=\"Kinning%20Park%20%28sports%20ground%29\"&gt;Kinning Park&lt;/a&gt; had been built up to hold 20,000 people, but further expansion was impossible and so the club identified a site further west to build a new ground. Although the site at &lt;a href=\"Ibrox%2C%20Glasgow\"&gt;Ibrox&lt;/a&gt; (at that time part of the &lt;a href=\"burgh\"&gt;burgh&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Govan\"&gt;Govan&lt;/a&gt;, today part of &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;) was then on the outskirts of the city, it had good transport links, including the nearby &lt;a href=\"Ibrox%20railway%20station\"&gt;Ibrox railway station&lt;/a&gt;. A ten-year lease on the site was secured and a ground constructed by Fred Braby &amp; Co. An uncovered 1,200-seat stand was erected on the northern side of the pitch with an adjacent pavilion. The other three sides were terraced, with a running track around the pitch. The ground was opened on 20 August 1887 with a friendly match against &lt;a href=\"Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.\"&gt;Preston North End&lt;/a&gt;.\nA new grandstand was built on the southern side of the pitch, after which the ground was used to host three &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; internationals; an &lt;a href=\"1889%20British%20Home%20Championship\"&gt;1889 British Home Championship&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; (7\u20130 to Scotland), an &lt;a href=\"1892%20British%20Home%20Championship\"&gt;1892 British Home Championship&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; (1\u20134) and an &lt;a href=\"1897%20British%20Home%20Championship\"&gt;1897 British Home Championship&lt;/a&gt; match against Ireland (5\u20131). It was also used to host the &lt;a href=\"1889%E2%80%9390%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;1890 Scottish Cup final&lt;/a&gt;, and the replay, between &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Park%20F.C.\"&gt;Queen's Park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Leven%20F.C.\"&gt;Vale of Leven&lt;/a&gt;.\nRangers were playing at the ground when they joined the new &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish Football League&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"1890%E2%80%9391%20Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;1890\u201391 season&lt;/a&gt;, with the first league match played at the ground on 18 August 1890, a 5\u20132 win against &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.\"&gt;Hearts&lt;/a&gt; in front of a crowd of 4,000. The ground was chosen to host the &lt;a href=\"1892%20Scottish%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1892 Scottish Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; and Queen's Park, but proved inadequate for the estimated 30,000 attendance. There were further problems when Ibrox hosted the international against England three weeks later; a stand collapsed, causing two deaths. The &lt;a href=\"1893%20Scottish%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1893 Cup Final&lt;/a&gt;, again between Celtic and Queen's Park, was also staged at Ibrox, but again there were problems; the match was declared void due to poor pitch conditions and had to be played again. The ground hosted the Cup Final for the fourth and last time when &lt;a href=\"St%20Bernard%27s%20F.C.\"&gt;St Bernard's&lt;/a&gt; played &lt;a href=\"Renton%20F.C.\"&gt;Renton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1895%20Scottish%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;1895&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the new &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Park\"&gt;Celtic Park&lt;/a&gt;, opened in 1892, becoming established as Glasgow's leading football venue, Rangers subsequently decided to take out a lease on a new site adjacent to Ibrox Park and build a new stadium from scratch, which opened in December 1899. The second Ibrox Park (now &lt;a href=\"Ibrox%20Stadium\"&gt;Ibrox Stadium&lt;/a&gt;) was built west of and partially overlapping the site of its predecessor, which backed directly onto Copland Road; the eastern end of the site was used for housing. The club's final league match at the original Ibrox Park was played on 9 December 1899, a 6\u20131 win over &lt;a href=\"Kilmarnock%20F.C.\"&gt;Kilmarnock&lt;/a&gt; with 5,000 in attendance. However, the new Ibrox was not ready in time for the next match against &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt; on 16 December, which was instead played at &lt;a href=\"Partick%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Partick Thistle&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Meadowside\"&gt;Meadowside&lt;/a&gt;."
