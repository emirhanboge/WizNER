    "text": "The Ch\u00e2teau de Vaujours is a ruined &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt; from the 12th and 15th centuries, located in the &lt;a href=\"Communes%20of%20France\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau-la-Valli%C3%A8re\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau-la-Valli\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Indre-et-Loire\"&gt;Indre-et-Loire&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Departments%20of%20France\"&gt;d\u00e9partement&lt;/a&gt;\" of central &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. It was part of the \"seigneurie\" (&lt;a href=\"Manorialism\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt;) of Chasteaux-en-Anjou, the future Ch\u00e2teau-la-Valli\u00e8re.\nLocation.\nThe castle is located 3 kilometres south of &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau-la-Valli%C3%A8re\"&gt;Ch\u00e2teau-la-Valli\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;. It stands on the eastern border of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Haut-Anjou\"&gt;Haut-Anjou&lt;/a&gt;, part of the former province of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Anjou\"&gt;Anjou&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe fiefdom of Vaujours was a dependency of the \"s\u00e9n\u00e9chauss\u00e9e\" (&lt;a href=\"bailiwick\"&gt;bailiwick&lt;/a&gt;) of &lt;a href=\"Baug%C3%A9\"&gt;Baug\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"diocese\"&gt;diocese&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Angers\"&gt;Angers&lt;/a&gt;. Hugues I d'Alluye, living in 978, is the earliest known lord. The castle of the barons of Chasteaux was built to defend the territory of Anjou.\nConstruction of the castle can be attributed to Hugues VI d'Alluye or to Rotron of Montfort, around 1250.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years War&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress was never taken by the English. A major restoration was undertaken in the 15th century. &lt;a href=\"Jean%20V%20de%20Bueil\"&gt;Jean V de Bueil&lt;/a&gt;, nicknamed \u00able Fl\u00e9au des Anglais\u00bb (the &lt;a href=\"flail\"&gt;flail&lt;/a&gt; of the English), altered the defences such that they became impregnable. He died there in 1477.\n&lt;a href=\"Louis%20XI%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XI&lt;/a&gt; stayed there during his visits to Anjou.\nThe daughter of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20VII%20of%20France\"&gt;Charles VII&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agn%C3%A8s%20Sorel\"&gt;Agn\u00e8s Sorel&lt;/a&gt;, Jeanne de Valois, married &lt;a href=\"Antoine%20de%20Bueil\"&gt;Antoine de Bueil&lt;/a&gt;, son of Jean V de Bueil.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Ancien%20R%C3%A9gime\"&gt;Ancien R\u00e9gime&lt;/a&gt;, the castle was bought by &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XIV%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XIV&lt;/a&gt; in 1666 and given in 1667 to his former mistress, Mademoiselle &lt;a href=\"Louise%20de%20la%20Valli%C3%A8re\"&gt;Louise de la Valli\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;; she became Duchesse de La Valli\u00e8re et de Vaujours.\nIn the 18th century, Louise de la Valli\u00e8re bequeathed it to the Davot family, who occupied the castle for a long period. The castle was abandoned during the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. In 1815, it was sold to Thomas Stanhope-Holland, who used it as a quarry.\nThe site was added to the list of \"&lt;a href=\"monument%20historique\"&gt;monuments historiques&lt;/a&gt;\" on 24 October 1944, and the ruins were classified on 26 January 1989.\nThe site and castle are private property but offer guided-tours to the public.\nArchitecture.\nThe castle ruins stand in the valley of the Fare, south of Ch\u00e2teau-la-Valli\u00e8re, close to the hamlet of Vaujours.\nThe castle, of typical military architecture, stands on a mound in the middle of a lake whose waters feed the &lt;a href=\"moat\"&gt;moat&lt;/a&gt;s which surround it. It is formed of two fortresses: a &lt;a href=\"Bailey%20%28fortification%29\"&gt;bailey&lt;/a&gt; to the west and the castle to the east.\nThe entry to the double &lt;a href=\"enceinte\"&gt;enceinte&lt;/a&gt; is defended by two cylindrical towers and a flying bridge, flanked to the north by a &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"drawbridge\"&gt;drawbridge&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"postern\"&gt;postern&lt;/a&gt;flanked by a cylindrical tower to the north provide access to the courtyard. The residence is to the south, the ruins of the chapel to the north. To the east, the towers give access to a covered \"&lt;a href=\"chemin%20de%20ronde\"&gt;chemin de ronde&lt;/a&gt;\" and to the south the bastion connected to the fortress and a further building.\nInside the fortress the &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; still exists, as does the lower courtyard. The enceinte includes several towers, some of which have &lt;a href=\"Rustication%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;rustication&lt;/a&gt;. The moats are drained and overgrown. The ruins have been cleared of vegetation and are surrounded by lawns and hedges."
