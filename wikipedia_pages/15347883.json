    "title": "Visionary environment",
    "text": "A visionary environment or fantasy world is a large &lt;a href=\"Installation%20art\"&gt;artistic installation&lt;/a&gt;, often on the scale of a building or &lt;a href=\"sculpture%20park\"&gt;sculpture park&lt;/a&gt;s, intended to express a vision of its creator. The subjective and personal nature of these projects often implies a marginal status for the artists involved, and there is a strong association between visionary environments and &lt;a href=\"outsider%20art\"&gt;outsider art&lt;/a&gt;."
