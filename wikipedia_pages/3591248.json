    "text": "Gheorghi Arnaoudov ( ; born 18 March 1957) is a Bulgarian composer of &lt;a href=\"stage%20%28theatre%29\"&gt;stage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orchestral\"&gt;orchestral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20music\"&gt;chamber&lt;/a&gt;, film, vocal, and piano music. His work has roots in &lt;a href=\"minimal%20music\"&gt;minimal music&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife.\nGheorghi Arnaoudov was born in 1957 in &lt;a href=\"Sofia\"&gt;Sofia&lt;/a&gt; and graduated in &lt;a href=\"musical%20composition\"&gt;composition&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Tanev\"&gt;Alexander Tanev&lt;/a&gt; and contemporary music with &lt;a href=\"Bojidar%20Spassov\"&gt;Bojidar Spassov&lt;/a&gt; from the State Academy of Music &lt;a href=\"Pancho%20Vladigerov\"&gt;Pancho Vladigerov&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, he attended summer courses working with &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Ferneyhough\"&gt;Brian Ferneyhough&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ton%20de%20Leeuw\"&gt;Ton de Leeuw&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis artistic career started in the early 1980s. At the same time, he did research work in the fields of &lt;a href=\"electronic%20music\"&gt;electronic music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"music%20theory\"&gt;music theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"musique%20concr%C3%A8te\"&gt;musique concr\u00e8te&lt;/a&gt;, as well as ancient far-Eastern and &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Greek%20music\"&gt;Greek music&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe has won many international and national awards, including the Grand Prix of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Broadcasting%20Union\"&gt;European Broadcasting Union&lt;/a&gt; (1985), the Golden Harp Prize from &lt;a href=\"Jeunesses%20Musicales\"&gt;Jeunesses Musicales&lt;/a&gt; (1985), the Special Prize of the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Bulgarian%20Composers\"&gt;Union of Bulgarian Composers&lt;/a&gt; (1986), and the &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber\"&gt;Carl Maria von Weber&lt;/a&gt; International Prize for Music (1989).\nHe is the author of scientific and theoretical articles in music, as well as of reviews in musical and scientific periodicals, mainly in the spheres of the aesthetics of modernism and postmodernism, communications in the music, the contemporary arts, musical semiotics, and the theory of contemporary music.\nIn 2000 Gega New released a CD with Arnaoudov's music called \"Thyepoleo. Orphic Mysterial Rites\". The texts used by the composer are the original preserved Orphic hymns. For this project he consulted renowned Thracologist &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Fol\"&gt;Alexander Fol&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote the programme notes.\nTo date Arnaoudov has produced numerous symphonies, oratorios, concertos and has won several international prizes. He currently teaches in the Theatre and Music departments of &lt;a href=\"New%20Bulgarian%20University\"&gt;New Bulgarian University&lt;/a&gt;. In 2009 he was appointed associate professor in Composition and Harmony.\nThe antecedents of his music can be found in &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Scriabin\"&gt;Alexander Scriabin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Olivier%20Messiaen\"&gt;Olivier Messiaen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Edgard%20Var%C3%A8se\"&gt;Edgard Var\u00e8se&lt;/a&gt; and, more recently, in the work of &lt;a href=\"Krzysztof%20Penderecki\"&gt;Krzysztof Penderecki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arvo%20P%C3%A4rt\"&gt;Arvo P\u00e4rt&lt;/a&gt;. The influence of composers like &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Webern\"&gt;Anton Webern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morton%20Feldman\"&gt;Morton Feldman&lt;/a&gt; is shown in the lack of any kind of conventional process or development.\nIn a series of works of Gheorghi Arnaoudov composer's vision is directed towards attaining a new aesthetic of pure music (Adorno), aestheticizing renaissance sound purity. By using various techniques (including also techniques legitimizing the language of Musical Avant-garde) and their substance rethinking is achieved a new music-sensuous semantic field."
