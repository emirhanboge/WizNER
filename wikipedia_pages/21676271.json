    "text": "SM \"UC-55\" was a German &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20UC%20II%20submarine\"&gt;Type UC II&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"minelayer\"&gt;minelaying&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"German%20Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;German Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; () during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. The U-boat was ordered on 12 January 1916, &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 25 February 1916, and was &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20ship%20launching\"&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt;ed on 2 August 1916. She was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commission&lt;/a&gt;ed into the German Imperial Navy on 15 November 1916 as SM \"UC-55\".\nDesign.\nA &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20UC%20II%20submarine\"&gt;German Type UC II submarine&lt;/a&gt;, \"UC-55\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;length overall&lt;/a&gt; of , a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28ship%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of , and a &lt;a href=\"draught%20%28ship%29\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; of . The submarine was powered by two six-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines each producing (a total of ), two electric motors producing , and two &lt;a href=\"propeller%20shaft\"&gt;propeller shaft&lt;/a&gt;s. She had a dive time of 48 seconds and was capable of operating at a depth of .\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . When submerged, she could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"UC-55\" was fitted with six mine tubes, eighteen UC 200 mines, three &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s (one on the stern and two on the bow), seven torpedoes, and one &lt;a href=\"8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun\"&gt;Uk L/30&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"deck%20gun\"&gt;deck gun&lt;/a&gt;. Her &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20company\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; was twenty-six crew members.\nService.\nIn 6 patrols \"UC-55\" was credited with sinking 9 ships, either by torpedo or by &lt;a href=\"naval%20mines\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; laid.\nLoss.\n\"UC-55\" sailed from &lt;a href=\"Heligoland\"&gt;Heligoland&lt;/a&gt; on 25 September 1917 to lay mines in the Lerwick Channel, the southern approach to the port of &lt;a href=\"Lerwick\"&gt;Lerwick&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shetland%20Islands\"&gt;Shetland Islands&lt;/a&gt;. On 29 September, just as she started dropping her mines, she suffered a loss of trim which resulted in her diving beyond her rated maximum dive depth. This in turn resulted in the forward compartment flooding, the batteries failing, and chlorine gas developing. She was forced to surface to ventilate the boat, but when she surfaced, the rudder refused to answer the helm due to the lack of battery power. Her captain then gave orders to destroy secret documents and codebooks and set scuttling charges in the mine room and engine room. While the charges were being placed she was sighted by the armed trawler \"Moravia\" and the destroyers and .\nA 12-pdr shell from the \"Sylvia\" hit the submarine's conning tower, killing her commander, Horst Ruhle von Lilienstern, and a second shell hit the hull and she began to sink, after which two depth charges were dropped right beside the \"UC-55\", resulting in the U-boat blowing up. The \"Moravia\" then closed with the wreck, fired two more shots into her, and dropped a final depth charge. Of the submarine's crew, 17 were taken prisoner, and 10 were killed.\nLocation of Wreck.\nThe wreck of \"UC-55\" is thought to lie in at . This site was surveyed on 3 July 1985, when &lt;a href=\"side%20scan%20sonar\"&gt;side scan sonar&lt;/a&gt; discovered the wreck of a submarine lying on its keel, and measuring approximately high and long."
