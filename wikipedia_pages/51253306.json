Blaakyum started performing without a bassist and covered pop/rock songs and spiritual songs in front of churches. Meanwhile, Maroun Azar left the band to concentrate on studying Medicine, and Jead Abdallah was asked to join the band as a Bassist since he is originally a guitarist but he couldn't fill that part so he decided to help the band in management.\nBlaakyum then switched styles into &lt;a href=\"grunge\"&gt;grunge&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Punk%20rock\"&gt;punk&lt;/a&gt; and performed their first gig at The Lebanese University Faculty Of Human Science\u2014Fanar without a bassist on most of the songs, except for some were handled by Generation X's (A Lebanese rock Band at the time) bassist. During 1996 Blaakyum auditioned several Bassists and the final choice was on Bassem's (Vocalist) brother Samer Deaibess to take the position. And then the band Switched to thrash metal performing mainly &lt;a href=\"Metallica\"&gt;Metallica&lt;/a&gt; songs. With the change of style Blaakyum started performing in many concerts and in pubs, including Rock Concert 1 and 2 at Beirut Hall. At this time the band performed Doom/Black and &lt;a href=\"Thrash%20metal\"&gt;Thrash metal&lt;/a&gt; songs, and by 1997 the bands set list was all originals. After dispute on musical differences and personal obligations, Jad Nohra and Samer Deaibess left the band. Mano was brought to fill in the bass role and the band started looking for a lead guitarist. after trying a couple of guitarists they found Shant Bajac, but Bajac had also official exams so he also left. Nohra rejoined the band, but things didn't work out, and he insisted that Bassem Deaibess would quit singing and concentrate on the rhythm Guitar, in the same time he started another band with Mano and Saad called \"Society\".\nDeaibess then met Vic Bajac (Shant's elder brother) in a rehearsal center where \"Society\" were rehearsing, and they decide to reform Blaakyum.\n1998\u20132001.\nBy 1998, the band changed their style into a blend of &lt;a href=\"Thrash%20metal\"&gt;Thrash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20metal%20music\"&gt;Heavy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Groove%20Metal\"&gt;Groove Metal&lt;/a&gt; infused with Middle Eastern and Levantine folk-music vibes, a nod to the band's origins and influences, coming from a country that straddles &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20world\"&gt;eastern&lt;/a&gt; and western civilizations on the south-eastern coast of the Mediterranean and with members inspired by &lt;a href=\"Metallica\"&gt;Metallica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Testament%20%28band%29\"&gt;Testament&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Overkill%20%28band%29\"&gt;Overkill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Annihilator%20%28band%29\"&gt;Annihilator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20%28band%29\"&gt;Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Slayer\"&gt;Slayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Maiden\"&gt;Iron Maiden&lt;/a&gt;, just to name a few, along with oriental music icons such as &lt;a href=\"Fairouz\"&gt;Fairouz&lt;/a&gt;, Sabah and &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Khalife\"&gt;Marcel Khalife&lt;/a&gt;.\nWinning the Lebanese Bands Competition in 1997, Blaakyum released its first single, \"Am I Black\", in 1998, at the height of the anti-Metal &lt;a href=\"witch%20hunt\"&gt;witch hunt&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the Lebanese religious and political authorities, who considered anyone affiliated with the scene a national threat, and during which the band's founder and frontman, Bassem Deaibess, was detained and jailed simply for being a heavy-metal musician and fan.\nDue to Lebanon's dire economic conditions and a mixture of personal and health problems that hit the band's members, Blaakyum was forced to split in 2001.
