    "text": "Anthony Bassano was a 16th-century &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; musician.\nBassano, born in Bassano del Grappa, Italy, was one of six sons of &lt;a href=\"Jeronimo%20Bassano\"&gt;Jeronimo Bassano&lt;/a&gt; (Anthony, Jacomo, &lt;a href=\"Alvise%20Bassano\"&gt;Alvise&lt;/a&gt;, Jasper, John and &lt;a href=\"Baptista%20Bassano\"&gt;Baptista&lt;/a&gt;) who moved from Venice to England to the household of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; to serve the court, probably in 1540. Of his ten children, the five sons (Mark Anthony, Arthur, Edward, Andrea and Jeronimo) all served as musicians to the court of Henry VIII, and a daughter (Lucreece Bassano) married &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Lanier%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Nicholas Lanier the Elder&lt;/a&gt;, grandfather of the artist-musician &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Lanier\"&gt;Nicholas Lanier&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe historian &lt;a href=\"A.L.%20Rowse\"&gt;A.L. Rowse&lt;/a&gt; in his correspondence to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Times\"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1973 claimed that the Bassanos were Jewish and Dr. David Lasocki of &lt;a href=\"Indiana%20University\"&gt;Indiana University&lt;/a&gt; claimed in his 1995 book that the family were converted &lt;a href=\"Jew\"&gt;Jew&lt;/a&gt;s. However, Giulio M. Ongaro in his \"New Documents on the Bassano Family\" in \"Early Music\" and Alessio Ruffatti (who did research in the archives of &lt;a href=\"Bassano%20del%20Grappa\"&gt;Bassano del Grappa&lt;/a&gt; assisted by Professor Pier Cesare Ioly Zorattini both argued that the Bassanos who moved to England were not of Jewish origin .\nBesides being wind players in the King's band, the Bassanos were also instrument makers.\nAnthony was recorded as a foreigner, formerly &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth's&lt;/a&gt; musician, resident in the London parish of &lt;a href=\"St%20Olave%20Hart%20Street\"&gt;St Olave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"All%20Hallows%20Staining\"&gt;All Hallows Staining&lt;/a&gt;, in 1607. He was married with five children, all born in England."
