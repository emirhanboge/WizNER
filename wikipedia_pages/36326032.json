In 2010, following an extraordinary congress of the party, he was elected president of the PC, with the support of the party's founder, Dan Voiculescu.

Voiculescu was sued in December 2008, in the case regarding the privatization of ICA, a state-owned company acquired by Voiculescu from the state after it was undervalued by over 60 million euros.
