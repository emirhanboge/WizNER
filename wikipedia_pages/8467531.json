    "text": "Poggio dei Pini, literally \u201cPine Knoll\u201d is a locality situated in south-west &lt;a href=\"Sardinia\"&gt;Sardinia&lt;/a&gt;, about 15\u00a0km from &lt;a href=\"Cagliari\"&gt;Cagliari&lt;/a&gt;, the island\u2019s capital. It is a &lt;a href=\"frazione\"&gt;frazione&lt;/a&gt; of the municipality &lt;a href=\"Capoterra\"&gt;Capoterra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe village, with about 2,000 inhabitants, is of a type unique in Sardinia, and unusual in Italy. It is not an ancient settlement; rather it was founded in the 1960s and 1970s when a group of people who loved nature and the countryside decided to make it their home. Gradually the infrastructure was developed and residents arrived. The community is organised as a &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt; which, it is said, has resulted in a higher standard of services that would otherwise have been expected.\nPoggio dei Pini lies within a hollow formed by the mountainous arc of &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Arrubiu\"&gt;Monte Arrubiu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Santa%20Barbara\"&gt;Monte Santa Barbara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Pauliara\"&gt;Monte Pauliara&lt;/a&gt;. The countryside, already attractive, was enhanced by planting a luxuriant pine wood around a small lake. The sea is some 4\u00a0km to the east; the beaches of &lt;a href=\"Nora%2C%20Italy\"&gt;Nora&lt;/a&gt; (20\u00a0km) and &lt;a href=\"Chia%2C%20Italy\"&gt;Chia&lt;/a&gt; (35\u00a0km) can be reached by the SS.\u00a0195. Nearby is the designated park and &lt;a href=\"nature%20reserve\"&gt;nature reserve&lt;/a&gt;, the mountainous \"Parco Del Sulcis\" forest area, a popular location for walking, trekking and mountain biking.\nTwo eighteenth-century edifices stand out in this area: the churches of Santa Barbara and of San Girolamo (&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Jerome\"&gt;Saint Jerome&lt;/a&gt;). The former is especially an object of devotion as, according to local legend, it was in this neighbourhood that &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Barbara\"&gt;Saint Barbara&lt;/a&gt; was decapitated."
