Often considered the greatest fullback in modern Nebraska history, Rathman set several school position records, some of which still stand, including most yards rushing by a fullback in a single season (881, in &lt;a href=\"1985%20Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football%20team\"&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;) and most career rushing touchdowns by a fullback (twelve).

His professional career spanned nine years as a fullback, the first eight with the 49ers. For the first five seasons, he was the lead blocker for another former Cornhusker, &lt;a href=\"Roger%20Craig%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Roger Craig&lt;/a&gt;. Rathman helped lead the 49ers to two &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl\"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt; championships, rushing for 38 yards, catching four passes for 43 yards, and scoring two touchdowns in &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20XXIV\"&gt;Super Bowl XXIV&lt;/a&gt;.

He became a pro coach in &lt;a href=\"1997%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt; when he joined the 49ers staff, and served as running backs coach through &lt;a href=\"2002%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;. In 2003, he accompanied head coach &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Mariucci\"&gt;Steve Mariucci&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Lions\"&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt; where Rathman was running backs coach during Mariucci's three seasons with the Lions. He then held the same position for the &lt;a href=\"Oakland%20Raiders\"&gt;Oakland Raiders&lt;/a&gt; for three seasons, and returned to the 49ers as running backs coach on January 7, 2009. Following the departure of head coach &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Singletary\"&gt;Mike Singletary&lt;/a&gt;, Rathman was retained by &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Harbaugh\"&gt;Jim Harbaugh&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2011%20San%20Francisco%2049ers%20season\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; season and was again retained by &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Tomsula\"&gt;Jim Tomsula&lt;/a&gt; for the 2015 season. After the firing of Tomsula a year later, Rathman was once again retained by new 49ers head coach &lt;a href=\"Chip%20Kelly\"&gt;Chip Kelly&lt;/a&gt; for the 2016 season. Following that season, Rathman was not re-hired after &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20Shanahan\"&gt;Kyle Shanahan&lt;/a&gt; was named head coach for the upcoming season.
