    "text": "Airdrieonians Football Club is a Scottish professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team in &lt;a href=\"Airdrie%2C%20North%20Lanarkshire\"&gt;Airdrie, North Lanarkshire&lt;/a&gt;, who are members of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Professional%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish Professional Football League&lt;/a&gt; (SPFL) and play in &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20League%20One\"&gt;Scottish League One&lt;/a&gt;. They were formed in 2002 as Airdrie United Football Club following the liquidation of the &lt;a href=\"Airdrieonians%20F.C.%20%281878%29\"&gt;original Airdrieonians club&lt;/a&gt;, formed in 1878. The club's official name was changed in 2013 with the approval of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Scottish Football Association&lt;/a&gt; to the traditional name of Airdrieonians. As with the previous club, this is often colloquially shortened to simply \"Airdrie\".\nThe club have won two trophies in their short history\u00a0\u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Scottish Second Division&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20Scottish%20football%23Scottish%20Second%20Division\"&gt;2003\u201304&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;2008\u201309&lt;/a&gt;. Once described as \"the luckiest team in the Scottish League\", the club have benefited in league division placements due to other club's misfortunes on three occasions (2008, 2009 and 2012).\nHistory.\nFormation as Airdrie United.\nThe club was formed in 2002 as Airdrie United, following the bankruptcy of the original &lt;a href=\"Airdrieonians%20F.C.%20%281878%29\"&gt;Airdrieonians&lt;/a&gt;.\nAirdrieonians had finished runners-up in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;Scottish First Division&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2001%E2%80%9302%20Scottish%20First%20Division\"&gt;2001\u201302 season&lt;/a&gt; but went out of business with debts approaching \u00a33 million. The collapse of \"The Diamonds\", as they were known due to their distinctive kits, created a vacancy in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League\"&gt;Scottish Football League&lt;/a&gt; (in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Scottish Third Division&lt;/a&gt;). Accountant and Airdrieonians fan &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Ballantyne\"&gt;Jim Ballantyne&lt;/a&gt; attempted, with the help of others, to gain entry with a club called \"Airdrie United\" who were essentially to be a reincarnation of Airdrieonians. Their application however was rejected as the then English &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Northern Premier League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Gretna%20F.C.\"&gt;Gretna&lt;/a&gt; were preferred by league members over the new Airdrie United.\nAirdrie United then went on to complete a buy-out of the ailing &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Clydebank%20F.C.%20%281965%29\"&gt;Clydebank&lt;/a&gt; and with SFL approval the club was relocated to Airdrie, the strips were transformed to resemble that of Airdrieonians, and the name was changed to Airdrie United. While this means that the club is therefore officially a legal continuation of Clydebank, it is almost universally accepted as a reincarnation of Airdrieonians, with &lt;a href=\"Clydebank%20F.C.\"&gt;a new version of Clydebank&lt;/a&gt; being &lt;a href=\"Phoenix%20club%20%28sports%29\"&gt;reformed by supporters' groups&lt;/a&gt; and entering into the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association%2C%20West%20Region\"&gt;West Region Junior League&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly years\u00a0\u2013 league title &amp; new manager (2002\u20132006).\nManaged by &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Stewart%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Sandy Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, Airdrie United's first match took place at &lt;a href=\"New%20Broomfield\"&gt;New Broomfield&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Forfar%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Forfar Athletic&lt;/a&gt; in August 2002, with captain &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Docherty\"&gt;Stephen Docherty&lt;/a&gt; scoring the only goal of the game with Airdrie United winning 1\u20130. Their debut season saw the club only narrowly fail to achieve promotion by one point due to a late injury-time goal from &lt;a href=\"Brechin%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Brechin City&lt;/a&gt; which saw them promoted instead. The club reached the second round of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the third round of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the third round of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish League Cup&lt;/a&gt; having beaten &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Kilmarnock%20F.C.\"&gt;Kilmarnock&lt;/a&gt; in the second round.\nDuring the rest of Stewart's tenure the club reached the final of the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 (losing 2\u20130 to &lt;a href=\"Inverness%20Caledonian%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Inverness Caledonian Thistle&lt;/a&gt;), and won the Second Division title in &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20Scottish%20Second%20Division\"&gt;2003\u201304 season&lt;/a&gt;. Having started poorly Airdrie went on a run that saw them unbeaten in the last 18 games of that season, including the final game of the league campaign which saw a crowd of over 5,700 at New Broomfield to watch Airdrie defeat &lt;a href=\"Greenock%20Morton%20F.C.\"&gt;Morton&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20130 and lift the League Championship trophy, the club having been confirmed champions the previous week following their 1\u20130 victory away to &lt;a href=\"Alloa%20Athletic%20F.C.\"&gt;Alloa Athletic&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Recreation%20Park%2C%20Alloa\"&gt;Recreation Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 2006, Stewart was sacked and replaced by former Airdrieonians player and Airdrie United coach &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Black\"&gt;Kenny Black&lt;/a&gt;, his first management post.\nMixed fortunes\u00a0\u2013 play-offs, cup win &amp; club changes (2006\u20132013).\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Kenny%20Black\"&gt;Kenny Black&lt;/a&gt; the club suffered four successive play-off defeats:\nThe club won the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;Challenge Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 2008, defeating &lt;a href=\"Ross%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Ross County&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20132 on penalties after a 2\u20132 draw, and after this success manager Kenny Black signed a long term contract (until 2012).\nAfter big financial cutbacks saw all players released in May 2010, it was announced the club would be operating on a part-time basis. The club's decision to focus on developing youth was vindicated in January 2011, as &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; signed teenager &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Watt\"&gt;Tony Watt&lt;/a&gt; for a sum of \u00a380,000 plus add-ons.\nThe first league game between Airdrie United and local rivals &lt;a href=\"Albion%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Albion Rovers&lt;/a&gt; took place at New Broomfield on 10 September 2011, with Airdrie winning 4\u20130. After another play-off defeat by 6\u20132 on aggregate to &lt;a href=\"Dumbarton%20F.C.\"&gt;Dumbarton&lt;/a&gt; in the promotion play-off final at the end of 2011\u201312 season Airdrie were lucky again as the liquidation of the company that operated &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Scottish Premier League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; and the decision by Scottish Football League clubs that Rangers should play in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Scottish Third Division&lt;/a&gt;, meant that an additional team from each tier of Scottish football was promoted for the 2012\u201313 season. As Airdrie were runners up in the previous season's Second Division promotion play-offs, they were promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;Scottish First Division&lt;/a&gt;. A season in the First Division came to an end in May 2013, with the club finishing bottom of the league and relegated to Division Two.\nAirdrieonians name returns (2013\u20132015).\nIn June 2013, the club officially changed its name from Airdrie United Football Club to Airdrieonians Football Club. The name change revived the name of the club it was formed to replace in 2002, following the liquidation of the &lt;a href=\"Airdrieonians%20F.C.%20%281878%29\"&gt;original Airdrieonians&lt;/a&gt;. The Airdrieonians all red club crest was also revived, with an alternate black and red version used for the away kits.\nNew ownership at the club (2015\u20132018).\nIn June 2015 &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Ballantyne\"&gt;Jim Ballantyne&lt;/a&gt; sold control of the club to Tom Wotherspoon, a Lanarkshire businessman and owner of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mandhlogistics.com/\"&gt;M &amp; H Logistics&lt;/a&gt; (who had previously sponsored &lt;a href=\"Hamilton%20Academical%20F.C.\"&gt;Hamilton Academical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Fife%20F.C.\"&gt;East Fife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"BSC%20Glasgow%20F.C.\"&gt;BSC Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;). Wotherspoon became Chairman and Ballantyne Vice-Chairman, appointing former &lt;a href=\"The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%23The%20Scottish%20Sun\"&gt;Scottish Sun&lt;/a&gt; newspaper Head of Sport Iain King as Chief Executive (King left the club in June 2016).\nAt a meeting with fans Wotherspoon outlined his long term plans for the club including a return to full-time football should the club gain promotion to the &lt;a href=\"SPFL%20Championship\"&gt;SPFL Championship&lt;/a&gt;, however he announced to the media in January 2016 that the club would be returning to full-time football in the summer of 2016 (irrespective of the division they would be playing in).\nIn December 2016 the Airdrieonians Supporters Trust became the first fans group in the world to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38315924\"&gt;sponsor&lt;/a&gt; their team's home kit, with the strip paying tribute to Airdrie fan &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.airdriefc.com/news/2016/12/homestrip\"&gt;Mark Allison&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite retaining his majority shareholding Tom Wotherspoon resigned as chairman and director of Airdrieonians on 5 June 2017, with former chairman &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Ballantyne\"&gt;Jim Ballantyne&lt;/a&gt; taking Wotherspoon's place as chairman.\nTakeover and COVID-19 (2018\u20132022).\nIn January 2018, it was announced that a consortium of various businessmen (including former Airdrieonians manager &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Watson%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Bobby Watson&lt;/a&gt;) had taken control of Tom Wotherspoon's controlling shares, bringing to an end a tumultuous period for the club. The majority of the previous board was replaced, including &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Ballantyne\"&gt;Jim Ballantyne&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently Director of Football &lt;a href=\"Gordon%20Dalziel\"&gt;Gordon Dalziel&lt;/a&gt; (appointed Oct 2016) departed. With Excelsior Stadium representation on the new board the club also indicated that they would be abandoning Ravenscraig Sports Complex and returning to training at the stadium.\nManager Ian Murray led the club to 5th, 3rd and 2nd place finishes in 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively, with the club missing out on play-off games (due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;) in 2020 and losing to &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Championship\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Greenock%20Morton%20F.C.\"&gt;Morton&lt;/a&gt; over a 2 legged play-off final in May 2021.\nStadium.\nAirdrie play their home fixtures at &lt;a href=\"Excelsior%20Stadium\"&gt;Excelsior Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, also unofficially known as New Broomfield, and for sponsorship reasons as the Penny Cars stadium.\nThe ground was built when now defunct &lt;a href=\"Airdrieonians%20F.C.%20%281878%29\"&gt;Airdrieonians&lt;/a&gt;' previous home, &lt;a href=\"Broomfield%20Park\"&gt;Broomfield Park&lt;/a&gt;, was sold to &lt;a href=\"supermarket%20chain\"&gt;supermarket chain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Safeway%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Safeway&lt;/a&gt;, who were given permission to build a new store on the site. This transaction has been cited as being the cause of the financial ruination of the club, as their old ground was demolished several years before they acquired planning permission for the new stadium. In the intervening years the club ground-shared &lt;a href=\"Broadwood%20Stadium\"&gt;Broadwood Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Cumbernauld\"&gt;Cumbernauld&lt;/a&gt;, the home of &lt;a href=\"Clyde%20F.C.\"&gt;Clyde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ground is owned by Broomfield Stadium Ltd, previously Excelsior Stadium Ltd, who rent the stadium to Airdrie, with the stadium owners sitting on the Board of the club. It has an all-seated capacity of and at the end of the 2009\u201310 season, a new 3G artificial surface was installed. The full size 3G at Penny Cars Stadium, alongside adjoining small-sided facilities are all made available for local community use.\nIn 2003 a ground share was proposed with &lt;a href=\"Falkirk%20F.C.\"&gt;Falkirk&lt;/a&gt; as their ground did not meet SPL requirements; this was later refused as Falkirk could not prove the SPL fixtures would have priority. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20the%20South%20F.C.\"&gt;Queen of the South&lt;/a&gt; played their &lt;a href=\"Uefa%20Cup\"&gt;Uefa Cup&lt;/a&gt; tie in 2008 at the stadium, as did &lt;a href=\"Motherwell%20F.C.\"&gt;Motherwell&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Park%20F.C.\"&gt;Queen's Park&lt;/a&gt; utilised the stadium for their \"home\" games from December 2013 until May 2014, due to the redevelopment of &lt;a href=\"Hampden%20Park\"&gt;Hampden Park&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2014%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;2014 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;.\nColours and crest.\nColours.\nAirdrie United inherited &lt;a href=\"Airdrieonians%20F.C.%20%281878%29\"&gt;Airdrieonians&lt;/a&gt;' distinctive playing colours of a white shirt with a red &lt;a href=\"rhombus\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;. The design was the basis of Airdrieonians' nickname, \"The Diamonds\", which has also been adopted by Airdrie.\nCrest.\nWhen Airdrie United were formed, they used a blue double-headed eagle device on a white shield for their badge, with a red scroll below the shield that read \"Airdrie United F.C.\", amended to bearing \"Airdrie F.C.\" when the club rebranded in 2012. The eagle recalled the &lt;a href=\"Airdrie%2C%20North%20Lanarkshire\"&gt;Airdrie&lt;/a&gt; town arms.\nWhen the club inherited the Airdrieonians name in 2013, they also restored the badge worn by their predecessors: the original AFC bore this emblem from 1974 until their demise in 2002, excepting the &lt;a href=\"2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20Scottish%20football\"&gt;2000\u201301 season&lt;/a&gt;. This badge featured a cockerel sitting atop a shield containing two &lt;a href=\"lion%20passant\"&gt;lions passant&lt;/a&gt; and the club's initials. The club were informed by the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Lyon%20King%20of%20Arms\"&gt;Lord Lyon King of Arms&lt;/a&gt; in March 2015 that as their badge features a shield, it constitutes a heraldic device, and heraldic devices are not permitted to carry lettering. On 19 June 2015, Airdrieonians unveiled a new crest, removing the shield and instead using a &lt;a href=\"Chevron%20%28insignia%29\"&gt;chevron&lt;/a&gt;\u2013representing the \"Airdrie Diamond\"\u2013to separate the scroll from the remainder of the badge.\nOfficial club awards.\nHall of Fame.\nA \"Hall of Fame\" was established by the new club in 2002 to honour noted players of the &lt;a href=\"Airdrieonians%20F.C.%20%281878%29\"&gt;previous entity&lt;/a&gt; (some of whom also played for the new club), with more entrants added each year."
