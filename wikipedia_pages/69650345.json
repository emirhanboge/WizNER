    "text": "The Chronicon Faventinum is a &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; chronicle of the city of &lt;a href=\"Faenza\"&gt;Faenza&lt;/a&gt; and the region of &lt;a href=\"Emilia-Romagna\"&gt;Emilia-Romagna&lt;/a&gt; from 20 BC until AD 1236. It was begun by a Faentine native, Tolosanus, a &lt;a href=\"deacon\"&gt;deacon&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3Amagister%23Latin\"&gt;magister&lt;/a&gt;\" and later &lt;a href=\"secular%20canon\"&gt;secular canon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Faenza%20Cathedral\"&gt;Faenza Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. He brought the record down to 1218. The chronicle was subsequently continued for a decade by at least two other anonymous writers, probably canons of the cathedral.\nTolosanus was born in the mid-12th century. He was a &lt;a href=\"rhetoric\"&gt;rhetoric&lt;/a&gt;ian active in municipal politics and in the local church. He had a &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Classics\"&gt;classical&lt;/a&gt; education, an understanding of juridical procedure and good &lt;a href=\"Latinity\"&gt;Latinity&lt;/a&gt;. He died on 5 April 1226.\nThe \"Chronicon\" is the earliest piece of urban historiography from Emilia-Romagna. it is divided into 153 chapters, each headed by a &lt;a href=\"rubric\"&gt;rubric&lt;/a&gt;. It begins with the mythical founding of the city by the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Romans&lt;/a&gt;, which Tolosanus dates to 20 BC. Tolosanus quotes extensively from &lt;a href=\"Virgil\"&gt;Virgil&lt;/a&gt; and the bible. His work is largely legendary until the period of the &lt;a href=\"Medieval%20commune\"&gt;communes&lt;/a&gt; (11\u201312th century). While for the earlier period, his chronology is based on the succession of &lt;a href=\"bishops%20of%20Faenza\"&gt;bishops of Faenza&lt;/a&gt;, for the communal period it is based on the succession of magistrates.\nIdeologically, the \"Chronicon\" has &lt;a href=\"Guelphs%20and%20Ghibellines\"&gt;Guelph&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., pro-papal) sympathies. The solidarity of the commune, the clergy and the bishop is stressed. Tolosanus was imbued with a &lt;a href=\"crusading\"&gt;crusading&lt;/a&gt; spirit and he glorifies the urban \"militia\". &lt;a href=\"Imola\"&gt;Imola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forli\"&gt;Forli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ravenna\"&gt;Ravenna&lt;/a&gt; are portrayed as Faenza's traditional enemies. Faenza was always a member of the &lt;a href=\"Lombard%20League\"&gt;Lombard League&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"Chronicon\" often rises above local history to cover the wider conflict between the league and the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. It records how the city sent 27 &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s to fight for the pope against the emperor during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Keys\"&gt;War of the Keys&lt;/a&gt; (1228\u20131230)."
