    "text": "The Kingdom of England (&lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt;: \"Regnum Anglorum\", \"Kingdom of the English\") was a &lt;a href=\"sovereign%20state\"&gt;sovereign state&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; from 12 July 927, when it emerged from various &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms, until 1 May 1707, when it united with &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Kingdom of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of England was among the most powerful states in Europe during the medieval period.\nOn 12 July 927, the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were united by &lt;a href=\"%C3%86thelstan\"&gt;\u00c6thelstan&lt;/a&gt; (r.\u00a0927\u2013939) to form the Kingdom of England. In 1016, the kingdom became part of the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20Empire\"&gt;North Sea Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cnut%20the%20Great\"&gt;Cnut the Great&lt;/a&gt;, a personal union between England, Denmark and Norway. The &lt;a href=\"Norman%20conquest%20of%20England\"&gt;Norman conquest of England&lt;/a&gt; in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at &lt;a href=\"Winchester\"&gt;Winchester&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt; quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre.\nHistories of the kingdom of England from the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20conquest\"&gt;Norman conquest&lt;/a&gt; of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: &lt;a href=\"Norman%20England\"&gt;Norman&lt;/a&gt; 1066\u20131154, &lt;a href=\"Plantagenet%20era\"&gt;Plantagenet&lt;/a&gt; 1154\u20131485, &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20period\"&gt;Tudor&lt;/a&gt; 1485\u20131603 and &lt;a href=\"Stuart%20period\"&gt;Stuart&lt;/a&gt; 1603\u20131707 (interrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum%20%28England%29\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; of 1649\u20131660).\nDynastically, all &lt;a href=\"English%20monarchs\"&gt;English monarchs&lt;/a&gt; after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans; the distinction of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plantagenet\"&gt;Plantagenets&lt;/a&gt; is merely conventional, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry II&lt;/a&gt; (reigned 1154\u20131189) as from that time, the &lt;a href=\"Angevin%20kings%20of%20England\"&gt;Angevin kings&lt;/a&gt; became \"more English in nature\"; the houses of &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt; are both Plantagenet cadet branches, the &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20dynasty\"&gt;Tudor dynasty&lt;/a&gt; claimed descent from &lt;a href=\"Edward%20III\"&gt;Edward III&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"John%20Beaufort%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Somerset\"&gt;John Beaufort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20VI%20and%20I\"&gt;James VI and I&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Stuart\"&gt;House of Stuart&lt;/a&gt; claimed descent from &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VII&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Tudor\"&gt;Margaret Tudor&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the conquest of England, the Normans gradually sought to extend their conquests both to the remainder of the British Isles and additional lands on the Continent, particularly in modern-day France. Over time, this would evolve into a long-standing policy of expansionism pursued intermittently with steadily increasing levels of aggression by successive, now-styled \"English\", dynasties. Beginning in the 12th century, the Normans began making serious incursions into Ireland. The completion of the &lt;a href=\"conquest%20of%20Wales%20by%20Edward%20I\"&gt;conquest of Wales by Edward I&lt;/a&gt; in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown, although Edward's attempts to completely subjugate Ireland met with very limited success while the initial success of his conquest of Scotland was undone by English military defeat under his son, Edward II. Edward III (reigned 1327\u20131377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the &lt;a href=\"English%20parliament\"&gt;English parliament&lt;/a&gt;. From the 1340s the kings of England also &lt;a href=\"English%20claims%20to%20the%20French%20throne\"&gt;laid claim&lt;/a&gt; to the crown of &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, but after the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years' War&lt;/a&gt; the English lost all their land on the continent, except for &lt;a href=\"Pale%20of%20Calais\"&gt;Calais&lt;/a&gt;. The subsequent outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Wars%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;Wars of the Roses&lt;/a&gt; in 1455 would ensure the English were never again in a position to seriously pursue their French claims.\nAfter the turmoil of the Wars of the Roses, the &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20dynasty\"&gt;Tudor dynasty&lt;/a&gt; ruled during the &lt;a href=\"English%20Renaissance\"&gt;English Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, in particular achieving the full union of England and the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Principality of Wales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Laws%20in%20Wales%20Acts%201535%20and%201542\"&gt;in 1542&lt;/a&gt;. The Tudors also secured English control of Ireland, although it would continue to be ruled as a &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;separate kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"personal%20union\"&gt;personal union&lt;/a&gt; with England for centuries. &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; triggered the &lt;a href=\"English%20Reformation\"&gt;English Reformation&lt;/a&gt; by breaking communion between the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, although the doctrinal aspects of the Reformation which established the English Church as being recognizably Protestant would not be pursued in earnest until the brief reign of his young son &lt;a href=\"Edward%20VI\"&gt;Edward VI&lt;/a&gt;. Following a return to Catholicism under the similarly brief reign of Henry's eldest daughter &lt;a href=\"Mary%20I\"&gt;Mary I&lt;/a&gt;, Mary's half-sister &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I\"&gt;Elizabeth I&lt;/a&gt; (reigned 1558\u20131603) re-established Protestantism under the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Elizabethan%20Religious%20Settlement\"&gt;Elizabethan Religious Settlement&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile establishing England as a &lt;a href=\"great%20power\"&gt;great power&lt;/a&gt; and laying the foundations of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British Empire&lt;/a&gt; by claiming possessions in the &lt;a href=\"English%20overseas%20possessions\"&gt;New World&lt;/a&gt;. While Henry also pursued an aggressive foreign policy north of the border in an attempt to subjugate Scotland, Elizabeth adopted a much more conciliatory position especially in light of developments such as Scotland's own Reformation and the eventual certainty that the Scottish monarch would succeed Elizabeth.\nFrom the accession of &lt;a href=\"James%20VI%20and%20I\"&gt;James VI and I&lt;/a&gt; in 1603, the &lt;a href=\"Stuart%20dynasty\"&gt;Stuart dynasty&lt;/a&gt; ruled England and Ireland in &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20the%20Crowns\"&gt;personal union&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, which culminated in the &lt;a href=\"execution%20of%20Charles%20I\"&gt;execution of Charles I&lt;/a&gt; in 1649. The monarchy returned in 1660, but the Civil War had established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without the consent of Parliament. This concept became legally established as part of the &lt;a href=\"Glorious%20Revolution\"&gt;Glorious Revolution&lt;/a&gt; of 1688. From this time the kingdom of England, as well as its successor states the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Kingdom of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; and the United Kingdom, have functioned in effect as a &lt;a href=\"constitutional%20monarchy\"&gt;constitutional monarchy&lt;/a&gt;. On 1 May 1707, under the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Union%201707\"&gt;Acts of Union 1707&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdoms of England and Scotland &lt;a href=\"Political%20union\"&gt;united&lt;/a&gt; to form the aforementioned Kingdom of Great Britain.\nName.\nThe Anglo-Saxons referred to themselves as the \"Engle\" or the \"Angelcynn\", originally names of the &lt;a href=\"Angles\"&gt;Angles&lt;/a&gt;. They called their land \"Engla land\", meaning \"land of the English\", \nby &lt;a href=\"%C3%86thelweard%20%28historian%29\"&gt;\u00c6thelweard&lt;/a&gt; Latinized \"Anglia\", from an original \"&lt;a href=\"Angeln\"&gt;Anglia vetus&lt;/a&gt;\", the purported homeland of the Angles (called \"Angulus\" by &lt;a href=\"Bede\"&gt;Bede&lt;/a&gt;). The name \"Engla land\" became \"England\" by &lt;a href=\"haplology\"&gt;haplology&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20English\"&gt;Middle English&lt;/a&gt; period (\"Engle-land\", \"Engelond\"). The &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; name was \"Anglia\" or \"Anglorum terra\", the &lt;a href=\"Old%20French\"&gt;Old French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Norman%20language\"&gt;Anglo-Norman&lt;/a&gt; one \"Engleterre\". By the 14th century, \"England\" was also used in reference to the entire island of Great Britain.\nThe standard title for monarchs from &lt;a href=\"%C3%86thelstan\"&gt;\u00c6thelstan&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"John%2C%20King%20of%20England\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; was ' (\"King of the English\"). &lt;a href=\"Canute%20the%20Great\"&gt;Canute the Great&lt;/a&gt;, a Dane, was the first to call himself \"King of England\". In the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20England\"&gt;Norman period&lt;/a&gt; ' remained standard, with occasional use of ' (\"King of England\"). From John's reign onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of ' or \"\". In 1604 &lt;a href=\"James%20VI%20and%20I\"&gt;James I&lt;/a&gt;, who had inherited the English throne the previous year, adopted the title (now usually rendered in English rather than Latin) \"King of Great Britain\". The English and Scottish parliaments, however, did not recognise this title until the Acts of Union of 1707.\nHistory.\nAnglo-Saxon England.\nThe kingdom of England emerged from the gradual unification of the early medieval &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20kingdoms\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Heptarchy\"&gt;Heptarchy&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia\"&gt;East Anglia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mercia\"&gt;Mercia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northumbria\"&gt;Northumbria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Essex\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sussex\"&gt;Sussex&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Wessex\"&gt;Wessex&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Viking%20invasions\"&gt;Viking invasions&lt;/a&gt; of the 9th century upset the balance of power between the English kingdoms, and native Anglo-Saxon life in general. The English lands were unified in the 10th century in a reconquest completed by King \u00c6thelstan in A.D. 927.\nDuring the Heptarchy, the most powerful king among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms might become acknowledged as &lt;a href=\"Bretwalda\"&gt;Bretwalda&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"high%20king\"&gt;high king&lt;/a&gt; over the other kings. The decline of Mercia allowed Wessex to become more powerful, absorbing the kingdoms of Kent and Sussex in 825. The &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Wessex\"&gt;kings of Wessex&lt;/a&gt; increasingly dominated the other kingdoms of England during the 9th century. In 827, Northumbria submitted to &lt;a href=\"Egbert%20of%20Wessex\"&gt;Egbert of Wessex&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dore%2C%20South%20Yorkshire\"&gt;Dore&lt;/a&gt;, briefly making Egbert the first king to reign over a united England.\nIn 886, &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20the%20Great\"&gt;Alfred the Great&lt;/a&gt; retook London, which he apparently regarded as a turning point in his reign. The \"&lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\" says that \"all of the English people (\"all Angelcyn\") not &lt;a href=\"Danelaw\"&gt;subject to the Danes&lt;/a&gt; submitted themselves to King Alfred.\" Asser added that \"Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, restored the &lt;a href=\"city%20of%20London\"&gt;city of London&lt;/a&gt; splendidly ... and made it habitable once more.\" Alfred's \"restoration\" entailed reoccupying and refurbishing the nearly deserted Roman walled city, building &lt;a href=\"Wharf\"&gt;quays&lt;/a&gt; along the &lt;a href=\"Thames\"&gt;Thames&lt;/a&gt;, and laying a new city street plan. It is probably at this point that Alfred assumed the new royal style 'King of the Anglo-Saxons.'\nDuring the following years Northumbria repeatedly changed hands between the English kings and the Norwegian invaders, but was definitively brought under English control by &lt;a href=\"Eadred\"&gt;Eadred&lt;/a&gt; in 954, completing the unification of England. At about this time, &lt;a href=\"Lothian\"&gt;Lothian&lt;/a&gt;, bordering the northern portion of Northumbria (&lt;a href=\"Bernicia\"&gt;Bernicia&lt;/a&gt;), was ceded to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Kingdom of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. On 12 July 927 the monarchs of Britain gathered at &lt;a href=\"Eamont\"&gt;Eamont&lt;/a&gt; in Cumbria to recognise \u00c6thelstan as king of the English. This can be considered England's 'foundation date', although the process of unification had taken almost 100 years.\nEngland has remained in political unity ever since. During the reign of &lt;a href=\"%C3%86thelred%20the%20Unready\"&gt;\u00c6thelred the Unready&lt;/a&gt; (978\u20131016), a new wave of Danish invasions was orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Sweyn%20I%20of%20Denmark\"&gt;Sweyn I of Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, culminating after a quarter-century of warfare in the Danish conquest of England in 1013. But Sweyn died on 2 February 1014, and \u00c6thelred was restored to the throne. In 1015, Sweyn's son &lt;a href=\"Cnut%20the%20Great\"&gt;Cnut the Great&lt;/a&gt; (commonly known as Canute) launched a new invasion. The ensuing war ended with an agreement in 1016 between Canute and \u00c6thelred's successor, &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Ironside\"&gt;Edmund Ironside&lt;/a&gt;, to divide England between them, but Edmund's death on 30 November of that year left England united under Danish rule. This continued for 26 years until the death of &lt;a href=\"Harthacnut\"&gt;Harthacnut&lt;/a&gt; in June 1042. He was the son of Canute and &lt;a href=\"Emma%20of%20Normandy\"&gt;Emma of Normandy&lt;/a&gt; (the widow of \u00c6thelred the Unready) and had no heirs of his own; he was succeeded by his half-brother, \u00c6thelred's son, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20the%20Confessor\"&gt;Edward the Confessor&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of England was once again independent.\nNorman conquest.\nThe peace lasted until the death of the childless Edward in January 1066. His brother-in-law was crowned &lt;a href=\"Harold%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;King Harold&lt;/a&gt;, but his cousin &lt;a href=\"William%20the%20Conqueror\"&gt;William the Conqueror&lt;/a&gt;, Duke of Normandy, immediately claimed the throne for himself. William launched an invasion of England and landed in &lt;a href=\"Sussex\"&gt;Sussex&lt;/a&gt; on 28 September 1066. Harold and his army were in &lt;a href=\"York\"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt; following their victory against the Norwegians at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stamford%20Bridge\"&gt;Battle of Stamford Bridge&lt;/a&gt; (25 September 1066) when the news reached him. He decided to set out without delay and confront the Norman army in Sussex so marched southwards at once, despite the army not being properly rested following the battle with the Norwegians. The armies of Harold and William faced each other at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hastings\"&gt;Battle of Hastings&lt;/a&gt; (14 October 1066), in which the English army, or \"&lt;a href=\"Fyrd\"&gt;Fyrd&lt;/a&gt;\", was defeated, Harold and his two brothers were slain, and William emerged as victor. William was then able to conquer England with little further opposition. He was not, however, planning to absorb the Kingdom into the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Normandy\"&gt;Duchy of Normandy&lt;/a&gt;. As a mere duke, William owed allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Philip%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip I of France&lt;/a&gt;, whereas in the independent Kingdom of England he could rule without interference. He was crowned on 25 December 1066 in &lt;a href=\"Westminster%20Abbey\"&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, London.\nHigh Middle Ages.\nIn 1092, &lt;a href=\"William%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;William II&lt;/a&gt; led an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde\"&gt;Strathclyde&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Celts\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; kingdom in what is now southwest Scotland and Cumbria. In doing so, he annexed what is now the county of &lt;a href=\"Cumbria\"&gt;Cumbria&lt;/a&gt; to England. In 1124, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry I&lt;/a&gt; ceded what is now southeast Scotland (called &lt;a href=\"Lothian\"&gt;Lothian&lt;/a&gt;) to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Scotland\"&gt;Kingdom of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, in return for the King of Scotland's loyalty. This final cession established what would become the traditional &lt;a href=\"England-Scotland%20border\"&gt;borders&lt;/a&gt; of England which have remained largely unchanged since then (except for occasional and temporary changes). This area of land had previously been a part of the Anglian &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria\"&gt;Kingdom of Northumbria&lt;/a&gt;. Lothian contained what later became the Scottish capital, &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;. This arrangement was later finalized in 1237 by the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20York\"&gt;Treaty of York&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine\"&gt;Duchy of Aquitaine&lt;/a&gt; came into &lt;a href=\"personal%20union\"&gt;personal union&lt;/a&gt; with the Kingdom of England upon the accession of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry II&lt;/a&gt;, who had married &lt;a href=\"Eleanor%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Aquitaine\"&gt;Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of England and the Duchy of Normandy remained in personal union until &lt;a href=\"John%2C%20King%20of%20England\"&gt;John Lackland&lt;/a&gt;, Henry II's son and fifth-generation descendant of William I, lost the continental possessions of the Duchy to &lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20France\"&gt;Philip II of France&lt;/a&gt; in 1204. A few remnants of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Normandy\"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Channel%20Islands\"&gt;Channel Islands&lt;/a&gt;, remained in John's possession, together with most of the Duchy of Aquitaine.\nConquest of Wales.\nUp until the Norman conquest of England, Wales had remained for the most part independent of the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon%20kingdoms\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, although some Welsh kings did sometimes acknowledge the &lt;a href=\"Bretwalda\"&gt;Bretwalda&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after the &lt;a href=\"Norman%20conquest%20of%20England\"&gt;Norman conquest of England&lt;/a&gt;, however, some Norman lords began to attack Wales. They conquered and ruled parts of it, acknowledging the overlordship of the Norman kings of England but with considerable local independence. Over many years these \"&lt;a href=\"Marcher%20Lords\"&gt;Marcher Lords&lt;/a&gt;\" conquered more and more of Wales, against considerable resistance led by various Welsh princes, who also often acknowledged the overlordship of the Norman kings of England.\n&lt;a href=\"Edward%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward I&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Llywelyn%20ap%20Gruffudd\"&gt;Llywelyn ap Gruffudd&lt;/a&gt;, and so effectively conquered Wales, in 1282. He created the title &lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt; for his heir, the future &lt;a href=\"Edward%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward II&lt;/a&gt;, in 1301. Edward I's conquest was brutal and the subsequent repression considerable, as the magnificent Welsh &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Conwy%20Castle\"&gt;Conwy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harlech%20Castle\"&gt;Harlech&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Caernarfon%20Castle\"&gt;Caernarfon&lt;/a&gt; attest; but this event re-united under a single ruler the lands of &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Britain\"&gt;Roman Britain&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the establishment of the Kingdom of the &lt;a href=\"Jutes\"&gt;Jutes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kent\"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; in the 5th century, some 700 years before. Accordingly, this was a highly significant moment in the history of medieval England, as it re-established links with the pre-Saxon past. These links were exploited for political purposes to unite the peoples of the kingdom, including the Anglo-Normans, by popularising &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20mythology\"&gt;Welsh legends&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20language\"&gt;Welsh language&lt;/a&gt;\u2014derived from the &lt;a href=\"British%20language%20%28Celtic%29\"&gt;British language&lt;/a&gt;, continued to be spoken by the majority of the population of Wales for at least another 500 years, and is still a majority language in parts of the country.\nLate Middle Ages.\n&lt;a href=\"Edward%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward III&lt;/a&gt; was the first English king to have a &lt;a href=\"English%20claims%20to%20the%20French%20throne\"&gt;claim to the throne of France&lt;/a&gt;. His pursuit of the claim resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Hundred Years' War&lt;/a&gt; (1337\u20131453), which pitted five kings of England of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plantagenet\"&gt;House of Plantagenet&lt;/a&gt; against five kings of France of the &lt;a href=\"Capetian%20House%20of%20Valois\"&gt;Capetian House of Valois&lt;/a&gt;. Extensive naval raiding was carried out by all sides during the war, often involving &lt;a href=\"privateer\"&gt;privateer&lt;/a&gt;s such as John Hawley of Dartmouth or the Castilian &lt;a href=\"Pero%20Ni%C3%B1o\"&gt;Pero Ni\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt;. Though the English won numerous victories, they were unable to overcome the numerical superiority of the French and their strategic use of gunpowder weapons. England was defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Formigny\"&gt;Battle of Formigny&lt;/a&gt; in 1450 and finally at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Castillon\"&gt;Battle of Castillon&lt;/a&gt; in 1453, retaining only a single town in France, &lt;a href=\"Calais\"&gt;Calais&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Hundred Years' War an &lt;a href=\"English%20identity\"&gt;English identity&lt;/a&gt; began to develop in place of the previous division between the Norman lords and their &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt; subjects. This was a consequence of sustained hostility to the increasingly nationalist French, whose kings and other leaders (notably the charismatic &lt;a href=\"Joan%20of%20Arc\"&gt;Joan of Arc&lt;/a&gt;) used a developing sense of French identity to help draw people to their cause. The &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Normans\"&gt;Anglo-Normans&lt;/a&gt; became separate from their cousins who held lands mainly in France and mocked the former for their archaic and bastardised spoken French. &lt;a href=\"Middle%20English\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; also became the language of the law courts during this period.\nThe kingdom had little time to recover before entering the &lt;a href=\"Wars%20of%20the%20Roses\"&gt;Wars of the Roses&lt;/a&gt; (1455\u20131487), a series of civil wars over possession of the throne between the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lancaster\"&gt;House of Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; (whose heraldic symbol was the red rose) and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20York\"&gt;House of York&lt;/a&gt; (whose symbol was the white rose), each led by different branches of the descendants of Edward III. The end of these wars found the throne held by the descendant of an initially illegitimate member of the House of Lancaster, married to the eldest daughter of the House of York: &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VII&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20of%20York\"&gt;Elizabeth of York&lt;/a&gt;. They were the founders of the &lt;a href=\"Tudor%20dynasty\"&gt;Tudor dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, which ruled the kingdom from 1485 to 1603.\nTudor period.\nWales retained a separate legal and administrative system, which had been established by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20I\"&gt;Edward I&lt;/a&gt; in the late 13th century. The country was divided between the &lt;a href=\"Marcher%20Lords\"&gt;Marcher Lords&lt;/a&gt;, who gave feudal allegiance to the crown, and the &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Principality of Wales&lt;/a&gt;. Under the Tudor monarchy, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt; replaced the laws of Wales with those of England (under the &lt;a href=\"Laws%20in%20Wales%20Acts%201535%E2%80%931542\"&gt;Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542&lt;/a&gt;). Wales was incorporated into the Kingdom of England, and henceforth was represented in the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20England\"&gt;Parliament of England&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the 1530s, Henry VIII overthrew the power of the Roman Catholic Church within the kingdom, replacing the pope as head of the English Church and seizing the Church's lands, thereby facilitating the creation of a variation of Catholicism that became more Protestant over time. This had the effect of aligning England with Scotland, which also gradually adopted a Protestant religion, whereas the most important continental powers, France and Spain, remained Roman Catholic.\nIn 1541, during Henry VIII's reign, the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Parliament of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; proclaimed him &lt;a href=\"king%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;king of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, thereby bringing the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Kingdom of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; into personal union with the Kingdom of England.\n&lt;a href=\"Calais\"&gt;Calais&lt;/a&gt;, the last remaining continental possession of the Kingdom, was lost in 1558, during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Philip%20II%20of%20Spain\"&gt;Philip&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mary%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Mary I&lt;/a&gt;. Their successor, &lt;a href=\"Elizabeth%20I\"&gt;Elizabeth I&lt;/a&gt;, consolidated the new and increasingly Protestant &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt;. She also began to build up the kingdom's naval strength, on the foundations Henry VIII had laid down. By 1588, her new navy was strong enough to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Armada\"&gt;Spanish Armada&lt;/a&gt;, which had sought to invade England to put a Catholic monarch on the throne in her place.\nEarly modern history.\nThe House of Tudor ended with the death of Elizabeth I on 24 March 1603. &lt;a href=\"James%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;James I&lt;/a&gt; ascended the throne of England and brought it into personal union with the Kingdom of Scotland. Despite the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20the%20Crowns\"&gt;Union of the Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdoms remained separate and independent states: a state of affairs which lasted for more than a century.\nCivil War and Interregnum.\nThe Stuart kings overestimated the power of the English monarchy, and were cast down by Parliament in 1645 and 1688. In the first instance, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles I&lt;/a&gt;'s introduction of new forms of taxation in defiance of Parliament led to the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt; (1641\u201345), in which the king was defeated, and to the abolition of the monarchy under &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Cromwell\"&gt;Oliver Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"English%20Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; of 1649\u20131660. Henceforth, the monarch could reign only at the will of Parliament.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"High%20Court%20of%20Justice%20for%20the%20trial%20of%20Charles%20I\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"execution%20of%20Charles%20I\"&gt;execution of Charles I&lt;/a&gt; in January 1649, the &lt;a href=\"Rump%20Parliament\"&gt;Rump Parliament&lt;/a&gt; passed an on 19 May 1649. The monarchy and the House of Lords were abolished, and so the House of Commons became a unitary legislative chamber with a new body, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20State%20%28England%29\"&gt;Council of State&lt;/a&gt; becoming the executive. However the Army remained the dominant institution in the new republic and the most prominent general was &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Cromwell\"&gt;Oliver Cromwell&lt;/a&gt;. The Commonwealth fought &lt;a href=\"Cromwellian%20conquest%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;wars in Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20in%20the%20Wars%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; which were subdued and placed under Commonwealth military occupation.\nIn April 1653 Cromwell and the other \"&lt;a href=\"Grandee%20%28New%20Model%20Army%29\"&gt;Grandee&lt;/a&gt;s\" of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Model%20Army\"&gt;New Model Army&lt;/a&gt;, frustrated with the members of the &lt;a href=\"Rump%20Parliament\"&gt;Rump Parliament&lt;/a&gt; who would not pass legislation to dissolve the Rump and to allow a new more representative parliament to be elected, stopped the Rump's session by force of arms and declared the Rump dissolved.\nAfter an experiment with a Nominated Assembly (&lt;a href=\"Barebone%27s%20Parliament\"&gt;Barebone's Parliament&lt;/a&gt;), the Grandees in the Army, through the Council of State imposed a new constitutional arrangement under a written constitution called the &lt;a href=\"Instrument%20of%20Government\"&gt;Instrument of Government&lt;/a&gt;. Under the Instrument of Government executive power lay with a &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Protector%20%28Protectorate%29\"&gt;Lord Protector&lt;/a&gt; (an office to be held for the life of the incumbent) and there were to be triennial Parliaments, with each sitting for at least five months. Article 23 of the Instrument of Government stated that Oliver Cromwell was to be the first Lord Protector. The &lt;a href=\"Instrument%20of%20Government\"&gt;Instrument of Government&lt;/a&gt; was replaced by a second constitution (the &lt;a href=\"Humble%20Petition%20and%20Advice\"&gt;Humble Petition and Advice&lt;/a&gt;) under which the Lord Protector could nominate his successor. Cromwell nominated his son &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Cromwell\"&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; who became Lord Protector on the death of Oliver on 3 September 1658.\nRestoration and Glorious Revolution.\nRichard proved to be ineffectual and was unable to maintain his rule. He resigned his title and retired into obscurity. The Rump Parliament was recalled and there was a second period where the executive power lay with the Council of state. But this restoration of Commonwealth rule, similar to that before the Protectorate, proved to be unstable, and the exiled claimant, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Charles II&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28England%29\"&gt;restored&lt;/a&gt; to the throne in 1660.\nFollowing the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, an attempt by &lt;a href=\"James%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;James II&lt;/a&gt; to reintroduce Roman Catholicism\u2014a century after its suppression by the Tudors\u2014led to the &lt;a href=\"Glorious%20Revolution\"&gt;Glorious Revolution&lt;/a&gt; of 1688, in which he was deposed by Parliament. The Crown was then offered by Parliament to James II's Protestant daughter and son-in-law/nephew, &lt;a href=\"William%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;William III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mary%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Mary II&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnion with Scotland.\nIn the Scottish case, the attractions were partly financial and partly to do with removing English trade sanctions put in place through the &lt;a href=\"Alien%20Act%201705\"&gt;Alien Act 1705&lt;/a&gt;. The English were more anxious about the royal succession. The death of &lt;a href=\"William%20III%20of%20England\"&gt;William III&lt;/a&gt; in 1702 had led to the accession of his sister-in-law &lt;a href=\"Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Anne&lt;/a&gt; to the thrones of England and Scotland, but her only surviving child had died in 1700, and the English &lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20Settlement%201701\"&gt;Act of Settlement 1701&lt;/a&gt; had given the succession to the English crown to the Protestant &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Hanover\"&gt;House of Hanover&lt;/a&gt;. Securing the same succession in Scotland became the primary object of English strategic thinking towards Scotland. By 1704, the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20the%20Crowns\"&gt;Union of the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; was in crisis, with the Scottish &lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20Security%201704\"&gt;Act of Security&lt;/a&gt; allowing for the Scottish Parliament to choose a different monarch, which could in turn lead to an independent foreign policy during a major European war. The English establishment did not wish to risk a &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Stuart\"&gt;Stuart&lt;/a&gt; on the Scottish throne, nor the possibility of a Scottish military alliance with another power.\nA &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Union\"&gt;Treaty of Union&lt;/a&gt; was agreed on 22 July 1706, and following the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Union%201707\"&gt;Acts of Union of 1707&lt;/a&gt;, which created the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Kingdom of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, the independence of the kingdoms of England and Scotland came to an end on 1 May 1707. The Acts of Union created a &lt;a href=\"customs%20union\"&gt;customs union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"monetary%20union\"&gt;monetary union&lt;/a&gt; and provided that any \"laws and statutes\" that were \"contrary to or inconsistent with the terms\" of the Acts would \"cease and become void\".\nThe English and Scottish Parliaments were merged into the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Parliament of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Westminster\"&gt;Westminster&lt;/a&gt;, London. At this point England ceased to exist as a separate political entity, and since then has had no national &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20England\"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;. The laws of England were unaffected, with the legal jurisdiction continuing to be that of &lt;a href=\"England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;, while Scotland continued to have its own laws and law courts. This continued after the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Union%201800\"&gt;1801 union&lt;/a&gt; between the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, forming the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland\"&gt;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. In 1922 the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Free%20State\"&gt;Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt; seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being &lt;a href=\"Royal%20and%20Parliamentary%20Titles%20Act%201927\"&gt;renamed&lt;/a&gt; the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nTerritorial divisions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;counties of England&lt;/a&gt; were established for administration by the &lt;a href=\"Normans\"&gt;Normans&lt;/a&gt;, in most cases based on earlier &lt;a href=\"shire\"&gt;shire&lt;/a&gt;s established by the &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxons\"&gt;Anglo-Saxons&lt;/a&gt;. They ceased to be used for administration only with the creation of the &lt;a href=\"administrative%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;administrative counties&lt;/a&gt; in 1889.\nUnlike the partly self-governing &lt;a href=\"ancient%20borough\"&gt;borough&lt;/a&gt;s that covered urban areas, the counties of medieval England existed primarily as a means of enforcing central government power, enabling monarchs to exercise control over local areas through their chosen representatives \u2013 originally &lt;a href=\"high%20sheriff\"&gt;sheriff&lt;/a&gt;s and later the &lt;a href=\"lord-lieutenant\"&gt;lord-lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s \u2013 and their subordinate &lt;a href=\"justice%20of%20the%20peace\"&gt;justices of the peace&lt;/a&gt;.\nCounties were used initially for the &lt;a href=\"administration%20of%20justice\"&gt;administration of justice&lt;/a&gt;, collection of taxes and organisation of the military, and later for local government and electing parliamentary representation.\nSome outlying counties were from time to time accorded &lt;a href=\"County%20palatine\"&gt;palatine&lt;/a&gt; status with some military and central government functions vested in a local noble or bishop. The last such, the &lt;a href=\"County%20Palatine%20of%20Durham\"&gt;County Palatine of Durham&lt;/a&gt;, did not lose this special status until the 19th century.\nAlthough all of England was divided into shires by the time of the Norman conquest, some counties were formed considerably later, up to the 16th century. Because of their differing origins the counties &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20counties%20of%20England%20by%20area%20in%201831\"&gt;varied considerably in size&lt;/a&gt;. The county boundaries were fairly static between the 16th century &lt;a href=\"Laws%20in%20Wales%20Acts%201535-1542\"&gt;Laws in Wales acts&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Local%20Government%20Act%201888\"&gt;Local Government Act 1888&lt;/a&gt;. Each shire was responsible for gathering taxes for the central government; for local defence; and for justice, through &lt;a href=\"assize%20courts\"&gt;assize courts&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe power of the &lt;a href=\"English%20feudal%20barony\"&gt;feudal barons&lt;/a&gt; to control their landholding was considerably weakened in 1290 by the statute of \"&lt;a href=\"Quia%20Emptores\"&gt;Quia Emptores&lt;/a&gt;\". Feudal baronies became perhaps obsolete (but not extinct) on the abolition of feudal tenure during the &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, as confirmed by the &lt;a href=\"Tenures%20Abolition%20Act%201660\"&gt;Tenures Abolition Act 1660&lt;/a&gt; passed under the &lt;a href=\"English%20Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; which took away knight-service and other legal rights.\nTenure by &lt;a href=\"knight-service\"&gt;knight-service&lt;/a&gt; was abolished and discharged and the lands covered by such tenures, including once-feudal baronies, were henceforth held by &lt;a href=\"socage\"&gt;socage&lt;/a&gt; (\"i.e.\", in exchange for monetary rents).\nThe English \"Fitzwalter Case\" in 1670 ruled that barony by tenure had been discontinued for many years and any claims to a &lt;a href=\"peerage\"&gt;peerage&lt;/a&gt; on such basis, meaning a right to sit in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lords\"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;, were not to be revived, nor any right of succession based on them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Statute%20of%20Rhuddlan\"&gt;Statute of Rhuddlan&lt;/a&gt; in 1284 followed the &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20of%20Wales%20by%20Edward%20I\"&gt;conquest of Wales&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward I of England&lt;/a&gt;. It assumed the lands held by the Princes of Gwynedd under the title \"&lt;a href=\"Prince%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Prince of Wales&lt;/a&gt;\" as legally part of the lands of England, and established shire counties on the English model over those areas. The &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Marches\"&gt;Marcher Lords&lt;/a&gt; were progressively tied to the English kings by the grants of lands and lordships in England. The &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Wales%20and%20the%20Marches\"&gt;Council of Wales and the Marches&lt;/a&gt;, administered from &lt;a href=\"Ludlow%20Castle\"&gt;Ludlow Castle&lt;/a&gt;, was initially established in 1472 by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20IV%20of%20England\"&gt;Edward IV of England&lt;/a&gt; to govern the lands held under the Principality of Wales and the bordering English counties. It was abolished in 1689. Under the &lt;a href=\"Laws%20in%20Wales%20Acts%201535%E2%80%931542\"&gt;Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542&lt;/a&gt; introduced under &lt;a href=\"Henry%20VIII%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry VIII&lt;/a&gt;, the jurisdiction of the marcher lords was abolished in 1536. The Acts had the effect of annexing Wales to England and creating a single state and legal jurisdiction, commonly referred to as &lt;a href=\"England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the same time the Council of Wales was created in 1472, a &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Council of the North&lt;/a&gt; was set up for the &lt;a href=\"North%20of%20England\"&gt;northern counties&lt;/a&gt; of England. After falling into disuse, it was re-established in 1537 and abolished in 1641. A very short-lived &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20West\"&gt;Council of the West&lt;/a&gt; also existed for the &lt;a href=\"West%20Country\"&gt;West Country&lt;/a&gt; between 1537 and 1540."
