    "text": "Ernest Thompson Seton (born Ernest Evan Thompson August 14, 1860\u00a0\u2013 October 23, 1946) was an author, wildlife artist, founder of the &lt;a href=\"Woodcraft%20Indians\"&gt;Woodcraft Indians&lt;/a&gt; in 1902 (renamed Woodcraft League of America), and one of the founding pioneers of the &lt;a href=\"Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America\"&gt;Boy Scouts of America&lt;/a&gt; (BSA) in 1910.\nSeton also influenced &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Baden-Powell\"&gt;Lord Baden-Powell&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of one of the first &lt;a href=\"Scouting\"&gt;Scouting&lt;/a&gt; organizations. His writings were published in the United Kingdom, Canada, the US, and the USSR; his notable books related to Scouting include \"The Birch Bark Roll\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Boy%20Scout%20Handbook\"&gt;Boy Scout Handbook&lt;/a&gt;\". He is responsible for incorporation of what he believed to be &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American Indian&lt;/a&gt; elements into the traditions of the BSA.\nEarly life.\nSeton was born in &lt;a href=\"South%20Shields\"&gt;South Shields&lt;/a&gt;, County Durham, England of Scottish parents. His family emigrated to Canada in 1866. Most of his childhood was spent in &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, and the family is known to have lived at 6 Aberdeen Avenue in &lt;a href=\"Cabbagetown%2C%20Toronto\"&gt;Cabbagetown&lt;/a&gt;. As a youth, he retreated to the woods of the &lt;a href=\"Don%20River%20%28Ontario%29\"&gt;Don River&lt;/a&gt; to draw and study animals as a way of avoiding his abusive father. He attended the &lt;a href=\"OCAD\"&gt;Ontario College of Art&lt;/a&gt; in 1879, studying with John Colin Forbes, then won a scholarship in art to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Academy\"&gt;Royal Academy&lt;/a&gt; in London, England in 1880. In the 1890s, he studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris\nOn his &lt;a href=\"Coming%20of%20age\"&gt;twenty-first birthday&lt;/a&gt;, Seton's father presented him with an invoice for all of the expenses connected with his childhood and youth, including the fee charged by the doctor who delivered him. According to one writer, he paid the bill, but never spoke to his father again. In his autobiography, \"Trail of An Artist-naturalist: The Autobiography of Ernest Thompson Seton\", he discusses the incident in detail, but, since he hadn't \"a cent of money,\" he could not pay his father. He went immediately to work and used the money he made to leave the household forever.\nIn 1882, he joined his brother on a homestead outside &lt;a href=\"Carberry%2C%20Manitoba\"&gt;Carberry, Manitoba&lt;/a&gt;, where he began to write. In 1891, he published \"The Birds of Manitoba\" and was appointed Provincial Naturalist by the government of &lt;a href=\"Manitoba\"&gt;Manitoba&lt;/a&gt;. He continued to publish books about Manitoba for decades to come, including \"The Life Histories of Northern Animals: An Account of the Mammals of Manitoba\" and lived in Manitoba until 1930, when he moved to &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Santa Fe, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe changed his name to Ernest Thompson Seton (after initially changing it to Ernest Seton-Thompson), believing that &lt;a href=\"Seton%20%28surname%29\"&gt;Seton&lt;/a&gt; had been an important family name. He became successful as a writer, artist, and naturalist, and moved to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; to further his career. Seton later lived at Wyndygoul, an estate that he built in &lt;a href=\"Cos%20Cob%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Cos Cob&lt;/a&gt;, a section of &lt;a href=\"Greenwich%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Greenwich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Connecticut\"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;. After experiencing vandalism by the local youth, Seton invited them to his estate for a weekend where he told them what he claimed were stories of the &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American Indians&lt;/a&gt; and of nature.\nHe formed the Woodcraft Indians in 1902 and invited the local youth to join. Despite the name, the group was made up of non-&lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;native&lt;/a&gt; boys and girls. The stories became a series of articles written for the \"&lt;a href=\"Ladies%20Home%20Journal\"&gt;Ladies Home Journal&lt;/a&gt;\", and were eventually collected in \"The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians\" in 1906. Shortly after, the Woodcraft Indians evolved into the Woodcraft Rangers, which was established as a non-profit organization for youth programming in 1922.\nSince 1922, Woodcraft Rangers has served Los Angeles youth with Seton's model of character building, which encompasses service, truth, fortitude, and beauty. Since then, Woodcraft Rangers youth have been received in a safe environment to encourage the discovery of their own talents. Today the Woodcraft Rangers organization serves over 15,000 youth in the Los Angeles county by helping them find pathways to purposeful lives. They offer expanded learning opportunities to youth from kindergarten to twelfth grade. Youth participants are encouraged to discover their natural talents and are embraced daily with the belief that all children are innately good.\nScouting.\nSeton met &lt;a href=\"Scouting\"&gt;Scouting&lt;/a&gt;'s founder, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Baden-Powell\"&gt;Lord Baden-Powell&lt;/a&gt;, in 1906. Baden-Powell had read Seton's book \"The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians\" and was greatly intrigued by it. The pair met and shared ideas.\nBaden-Powell went on to found the Scouting movement worldwide and Seton became the president of the committee that founded the &lt;a href=\"Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America\"&gt;Boy Scouts of America&lt;/a&gt; (BSA) and was its first (and only) Chief Scout. Seton's \"&lt;a href=\"Woodcraft%20Indians\"&gt;Woodcraft Indians&lt;/a&gt;\" (a youth organization) combined with the early attempts at Scouting from the &lt;a href=\"YMCA\"&gt;YMCA&lt;/a&gt; and other organizations and with &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Carter%20Beard\"&gt;Daniel Carter Beard&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Daniel%20Boone\"&gt;Sons of Daniel Boone&lt;/a&gt;, to form the BSA. The work of Seton and Beard is in large part the basis of the &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Scouting\"&gt;Traditional Scouting&lt;/a&gt; movement.\nSeton served as Chief Scout of the BSA from 1910 to 1915 and his work is in large part responsible for the appropriation and incorporation of what he believed to be &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American Indian&lt;/a&gt; elements into the traditions of the BSA. However, he had significant personality and philosophical clashes with Beard and &lt;a href=\"James%20E.%20West%20%28Scouting%29\"&gt;James E. West&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to disputes about the content of Seton's contributions to the Boy Scout Handbook, conflicts also arose about the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;suffragist&lt;/a&gt; activities of his wife, &lt;a href=\"Grace%20Gallatin%20Seton%20Thompson\"&gt;Grace Gallatin Seton Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, and his British citizenship. The citizenship issue arose partly because of his high position within the BSA and the federal charter West was attempting to obtain for the BSA requiring its board members to be United States citizens. Seton drafted his written resignation on January 29, 1915, but did not send it to the BSA until May. The position of Chief Scout was eliminated and the position \"Chief Scout Executive\" was taken on by James West. In 1931, Seton became a United States citizen.\nPersonal life.\nSeton married twice. His first marriage was to &lt;a href=\"Grace%20Gallatin%20Seton\"&gt;Grace Gallatin&lt;/a&gt; in 1896. Their only daughter, Ann (1904\u20131990), later known as &lt;a href=\"Anya%20Seton\"&gt;Anya Seton&lt;/a&gt;, became a best-selling author of historical and biographical novels. According to Ann's introduction to the novel \"&lt;a href=\"Green%20Darkness\"&gt;Green Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\", Grace was a practicing &lt;a href=\"Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29\"&gt;Theosophist&lt;/a&gt;.\nErnest and Grace divorced in 1935, and Ernest soon married Julia Moss Buttree. Julia wrote works by herself and with Ernest. They did not have any biological children, but in the 1930s they sought to adopt Moss Buttree's niece, Leila Moss, who lived with them for years in New Mexico. In 1938, they adopted an infant daughter, Beulah (Dee) Seton (later Dee Seton Barber). Dee Seton Barber, a talented embroiderer of articles for synagogues such as Torah mantles, died in 2006.\nSeton called his father, Joseph Logan Thompson, \"the most selfish man I ever knew, or heard of, in history or in fiction.\" He cut off ties completely after being made to pay off an itemized list of all expenses he had cost his father, up to and including the doctor's fee for his delivery, a total of $537.50.\nSeton's parents lived out their lives in Toronto, as did all but two brothers, who moved to British Columbia.\nWriting and later life.\nSeton was an early pioneer of the modern school of &lt;a href=\"Fiction%23Categories\"&gt;animal fiction&lt;/a&gt; writing, his most popular work being \"&lt;a href=\"Wild%20Animals%20I%20Have%20Known\"&gt;Wild Animals I Have Known&lt;/a&gt;\" (1898), which contains the story of his killing of the wolf &lt;a href=\"Lobo%20%28The%20King%20of%20Currumpaw%29\"&gt;Lobo&lt;/a&gt;. He later became involved in a literary debate known as the &lt;a href=\"nature%20fakers%20controversy\"&gt;nature fakers controversy&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"John%20Burroughs\"&gt;John Burroughs&lt;/a&gt; published an article in 1903 in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Atlantic\"&gt;\"Atlantic Monthly\"&lt;/a&gt; attacking writers of sentimental animal stories. The controversy lasted for four years and included important American environmental and political figures of the day, including President &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1907, Seton and the naturalist &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Alexander%20Preble\"&gt;Edward Alexander Preble&lt;/a&gt; verified a claim from 10 years earlier by the frontiersman Charles \"Buffalo\" Jones that Jones and his hunting party had shot and fended off a hungry &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; pack near the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Slave%20Lake\"&gt;Great Slave Lake&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Seton and Preble discovered the remains of the animals near Jones's long abandoned cabin.\nFor his work, \"Lives of Game Animals Volume 4\", Seton was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Giraud%20Elliot%20Medal\"&gt;Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in 1928 . In 1931, he became a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20citizen\"&gt;United States citizen&lt;/a&gt;. Seton was associated with the Santa Fe arts and literary community during the mid-1930s and early 1940s, which was a group of artists and authors, including author and artist &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Morang\"&gt;Alfred Morang&lt;/a&gt;, sculptor and potter &lt;a href=\"Clem%20Hull\"&gt;Clem Hull&lt;/a&gt;, painter &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20O%27Keeffe\"&gt;Georgia O'Keeffe&lt;/a&gt;, painter Randall Davey, painter &lt;a href=\"Raymond%20Jonson\"&gt;Raymond Jonson&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Transcendental Painters Group and artist Eliseo Rodriguez.\nHe was made a member of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Canadian%20Academy%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Royal Canadian Academy of Arts&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1933, Seton purchased 100 acres (0.4 km2) in &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%20County%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Santa Fe County&lt;/a&gt;, New Mexico, United States. Seton ran training camps for youth leaders and had a small publisher named Seton Village Press that closed in 1943 due to &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The tract eventually grew to 2,500 acres (10\u00a0km2). &lt;a href=\"Seton%20Village\"&gt;Seton Village&lt;/a&gt; was established as an &lt;a href=\"Unincorporated%20area\"&gt;unincorporated community&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeton designed and built his castle as a 32-room, 6,900 square foot (640 m2) multi-level building with a flat-roof and rough hewn stone wall exterior. The interior had oak floors and plaster walls with the ceilings supported by log rafters. The castle was built on a hill at an elevation of 7,000 feet (2100 m). It is designated a &lt;a href=\"National%20Historic%20Landmark\"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt; and a New Mexico State Cultural Property. The castle burned down while being restored in 2005. The &lt;a href=\"Academy%20for%20the%20Love%20of%20Learning\"&gt;Academy for the Love of Learning&lt;/a&gt;, which owns the property, has decided to preserve the castle ruins as a \"contemplative garden.\"\nHe died in Seton Village, New Mexico, at the age of 86. Seton was cremated in &lt;a href=\"Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico\"&gt;Albuquerque&lt;/a&gt;, New Mexico. In 1960, in honor of his 100th birthday and the 350th anniversary of Santa Fe, his daughter, Dee and his grandson, Seton Cottier (son of Anya), scattered the ashes over Seton Village from an &lt;a href=\"airplane\"&gt;airplane&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Philmont%20Scout%20Ranch\"&gt;Philmont Scout Ranch&lt;/a&gt; houses the &lt;a href=\"Philmont%20Scout%20Ranch%23National%20Scouting%20Museum\"&gt;Seton Memorial Library and Museum&lt;/a&gt;. Seton Castle in Santa Fe, built by Seton as his last residence, housed many of his other items. Seton Castle burned down in 2005 during an attempt at restoration, but all the artwork, manuscripts, books, etc., had been removed to storage before renovation was to have begun.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Academy%20for%20the%20Love%20of%20Learning\"&gt;Academy for the Love of Learning&lt;/a&gt;, an educational organization in Santa Fe, acquired Seton Castle and its contents in 2003. The new Academy Center that opened in 2011 includes a gallery and archives featuring artwork and other materials as part of its Seton Legacy Project. The Seton Legacy Project organized a major exhibition on Seton opening at the &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico%20History%20Museum\"&gt;New Mexico History Museum&lt;/a&gt; on May 23, 2010, the catalog published as \"Ernest Thompson Seton: The Life and Legacy of an Artist and Conservationist\" by David L. Witt.\n&lt;a href=\"Roger%20Tory%20Peterson\"&gt;Roger Tory Peterson&lt;/a&gt; drew inspiration for his field guide from the simple diagram of ducks that Seton included in \"Two Little Savages\".\nSeton is honored by the &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Thompson%20Seton%20Scout%20Reservation\"&gt;Ernest Thompson Seton Scout Reservation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Greenwich%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Greenwich, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, and with the &lt;a href=\"E.T.%20Seton%20Park\"&gt;E.T. Seton Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Toronto%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Toronto, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. Obtained in the early 1960s as the site of the future &lt;a href=\"Metro%20Toronto%20Zoo\"&gt;Metro Toronto Zoo&lt;/a&gt;, the land was later used to establish parkland and home to the &lt;a href=\"Ontario%20Science%20Centre\"&gt;Ontario Science Centre&lt;/a&gt;. A plaque is found on the front wall of 6 Aberdeen Avenue in Toronto, where Seton had lived as a child.\nIn pop culture.\nIn television.\n\"\" (, \"Seton Doubutsuki: Kuma no Ko Jacky\") was a 26-episode &lt;a href=\"anime\"&gt;anime&lt;/a&gt; television series based on Seton's novel of the same name, and was first broadcast in 1977.\nIn 1979, a 26-episode anime series based on Seton's 1922 book \"&lt;a href=\"Bannertail\"&gt;Bannertail: The Story of a Gray Squirrel&lt;/a&gt;\" was produced in &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Nippon%20Animation\"&gt;Nippon Animation&lt;/a&gt;, called (, \"Sh\u012bton D\u014dbutsuki Risu no Ban\u0101\").\nIn 1989\u20131990, &lt;a href=\"Eiken%20%28studio%29\"&gt;Eiken&lt;/a&gt; released \"Seton D\u014dbutsuki\" (, '\"Seton Animal Chronicles\"'), a 45-episode anime TV series adapted from the &lt;a href=\"manga\"&gt;manga&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Seton%27s%20Wild%20Animals\"&gt;Seton's Wild Animals&lt;/a&gt;\" (), depicting the different literary works of Seton, including his 1898 \"&lt;a href=\"Wild%20Animals%20I%20Have%20Known\"&gt;Wild Animals I Have Known&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Lobo, the King of Currumpaw\" (episodes 17 and 18) was a notable episode of the show which many viewers later came to know when the storyline was plotted into a popular 2009 TV documentary entitled \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wolf%20That%20Changed%20America\"&gt;The Wolf That Changed America&lt;/a&gt;\". The cartoon was dubbed in German, Catalan, and Arabic, and saw an emerging popularity among Arabs in the early 1990s as \"Mokhles Sadik ul Hayawaan\" (, \"'Mokhles, Animals' Friend\"').\n\"Chink, the Development of a Pup\" was adapted into a cartoon in Russian in 1992.\nIn October 2015, the Comedy Central show \"&lt;a href=\"Drunk%20History\"&gt;Drunk History&lt;/a&gt;\" gave a short, drunk history lesson by Mike Still (season 3, episode 10, second act) in which Seton is portrayed by &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Hanks\"&gt;Colin Hanks&lt;/a&gt;. It mostly concentrates on the &lt;a href=\"Lobo%20the%20King%20of%20Currumpaw\"&gt;story of Lobo&lt;/a&gt;, but also mentions the roots of the Boy Scouts and helping out troubled teens.\nIn literature and manga.\nThe five-volume &lt;a href=\"manga\"&gt;manga&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Seton%27s%20Wild%20Animals\"&gt;Seton's Wild Animals&lt;/a&gt;\" () by &lt;a href=\"Sanpei%20Shirato\"&gt;Sanpei Shirato&lt;/a&gt;, published between 1961 and 1965, portrayed the various literary works of Seton. Kenji Uchiyama translated Seton's work for the manga from English into Japanese.\nIn 1988, &lt;a href=\"Yury%20Iosifovich%20Koval\"&gt;Yury Iosifovich Koval&lt;/a&gt; published a short novel called \"\u0428\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430\" (\"Shamayka\"), a retelling of \"The Slum Cat\".\nIn a 1993 issue of the Japanese manga \"&lt;a href=\"Diamond%20is%20Unbreakable\"&gt;Diamond is Unbreakable&lt;/a&gt;\", the character &lt;a href=\"Jotaro%20Kujo\"&gt;Jotaro Kujo&lt;/a&gt; references Seton's quote \"there is no animal that cannot be tracked\".\nSeveral of Seton's works are written from the perspective of a predator and were an influence upon &lt;a href=\"Robert%20T.%20Bakker\"&gt;Robert T. Bakker&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Raptor%20Red\"&gt;Raptor Red&lt;/a&gt;\" (1995).\nFrom 2004\u20132006, &lt;a href=\"manga%20artist\"&gt;manga artist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jiro%20Taniguchi\"&gt;Jiro Taniguchi&lt;/a&gt; and scenarist Yoshiharu Imaizumi published \"Sh\u012bton\" (), a four-volume manga romanticizing the life of Seton. These mangas were not translated into English, but appeared in French, Italian and Spanish. The French titles are:\nSeton's appearance inspired the design of the character Shiton Anehata, a scholar and &lt;a href=\"Zoophilia\"&gt;zoophile&lt;/a&gt; who is one of the &lt;a href=\"Abashiri%20Prison\"&gt;Abashiri&lt;/a&gt; convicts in the manga \"&lt;a href=\"Golden%20Kamuy\"&gt;Golden Kamui&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSeton is also mentioned in &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Roth\"&gt;Philip Roth&lt;/a&gt;'s 2010 novel, \"&lt;a href=\"Nemesis%20%28Roth%20novel%29\"&gt;Nemesis&lt;/a&gt;\", where he is credited for having introduced &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Indian lore&lt;/a&gt; to the American camping movement."
