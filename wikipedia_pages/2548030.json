The city was originally settled by Azorean descendants and later received a contingent of German and Italian immigrants. Gramado is one of the cities along the scenic route known as \"&lt;a href=\"Rota%20Rom%C3%A2ntica\"&gt;Rota Rom\u00e2ntica&lt;/a&gt;\" (Romantic Route).\nHistory.\nGramado was originally settled in 1875 by Portuguese immigrants. Five years later, the first German immigrants arrived and these were followed shortly after by Italian immigrants from the Italian settlements in &lt;a href=\"Caxias%20do%20Sul\"&gt;Caxias do Sul&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1913, the city seat was moved to Linha Nova, the location of the present-day city center. At this time, Gramado was an unincorporated city within the city of &lt;a href=\"Taquara\"&gt;Taquara&lt;/a&gt;. A railway, brought by Gramado's founder and first administrator, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Nicoletti%20Filho\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Nicoletti Filho&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in the city in 1921, boosting the local economy.
