    "text": "Pumari Chhish (), (or Pumarikish, Peak 11) is a high peak in the &lt;a href=\"Shimshal\"&gt;Shimshal Valley&lt;/a&gt;, a village of the &lt;a href=\"Karakoram\"&gt;Karakoram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mountain%20range\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt;. It lies about 4\u00a0km east of &lt;a href=\"Khunyang%20Chhish\"&gt;Khunyang Chhish&lt;/a&gt;, in the heart of the Hispar, north of the Hispar &lt;a href=\"Glacier\"&gt;Glacier&lt;/a&gt;.\nPumari Chhish was first attempted by an &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;n group in 1974, who failed to climb or bypass the Yazghil Glacier on the north side of the peak. In 1979, a &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese group from the Hokkaido Alpine Association and Pakistani Army officer of 29 signal succeeded in climbing the mountain via a long route starting from the Khunyang Glacier, well to the west of the peak. They first had to cross a significant &lt;a href=\"mountain%20pass\"&gt;col&lt;/a&gt; to access the upper Yazghil Glacier; they then ascended the north ridge of Pumari Chhish.\nAccording to the Himalayan Index, there have been no other successful ascents of Pumari Chhish.\nPumari Chhish South.\nAbout to the southeast of the main summit of Pumari Chhish lies Pumari Chhish South, . After two unsuccessful attempts on this peak in 1999 and 2000 by Julie-Ann Clyma and Roger Payne, it was first climbed on June 12, 2007, by Yannick Graziani and Christian Trommsdorff. Among first ascents of peaks over 7000 metres, their climb was highly technical (they rate it &lt;a href=\"Grade%20%28climbing%29\"&gt;ABO 5.10 M6 A1&lt;/a&gt;). They made the ascent in pure &lt;a href=\"alpine%20style\"&gt;alpine style&lt;/a&gt; over six days. Their achievement earned them the lead article in the 2008 \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Alpine%20Journal\"&gt;American Alpine Journal&lt;/a&gt;\"."
