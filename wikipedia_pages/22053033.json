He was a priest of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Indian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;. He was the &lt;a href=\"author\"&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of many doctrinal books and papers including \"The Council of Chalcedon Re-Examined: Historical Theological Survey\".\nEarly life.\nSamuel was born 6 April 1912, at Edayil House - Cheekanal in the village of &lt;a href=\"Omallur\"&gt;Omallur&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British Raj&lt;/a&gt; Province of &lt;a href=\"Travancore\"&gt;Travancore&lt;/a&gt;, now &lt;a href=\"Pathanamthitta\"&gt;Pathanamthitta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kerala%20State\"&gt;Kerala State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. He was born in an Orthodox Syrian Christian family. He was the fifth child of nine children of his parents E.I. Cherian and Annamma. His father E.I. Cherian was a school teacher and educationist, who established 15 primary schools when there was little facility for modern education and a member of the Legislative Assembly (&lt;a href=\"Sree%20Moolam%20Popular%20Assembly\"&gt;Sree Moolam Popular Assembly&lt;/a&gt;).\nEducation.\nSamuel had his primary education in a school founded by his father in his village and the Government English Middle School, &lt;a href=\"Pathanamthitta\"&gt;Pathanamthitta&lt;/a&gt;. Samuel obtained his secondary education at St. Thomas English High School (&lt;a href=\"St.%20Thomas%20Higher%20Secondary%20School%2C%20Kozhencherry\"&gt;St. Thomas Higher Secondary School Kozhencherry&lt;/a&gt;). He received his English School Leaving Certificate (E.S.L.C) in 1931 with distinction.\nSeminary teacher and scholar.\nIn addition to his general education, Samuel learned the &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20language\"&gt;Syriac language&lt;/a&gt;, which was the &lt;a href=\"ecclesiastical\"&gt;ecclesiastical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"liturgical%20language\"&gt;liturgical language&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Thomas%20Christians\"&gt;St. Thomas Christians&lt;/a&gt; of Kerala.\n&lt;a href=\"Patriarch\"&gt;Patriarch&lt;/a&gt; Mar &lt;a href=\"Ignatius%20Elias%20III\"&gt;Ignatius Elias III&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Antioch\"&gt;Antioch&lt;/a&gt; visited India in 1932. Samuel had a sincere longing for the success of the patriarchal mission and was deeply moved when the spiritual head of the Syrian Orthodox Church died at &lt;a href=\"Manjanikkara%20Dayara\"&gt;Manjanikkara&lt;/a&gt;, in the neighbourhood of his home in 1932. The place where the Patriarch had died soon grew in stature as St. Ignatius Church, a center of religious activities, including the teaching of &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20language\"&gt;Syriac&lt;/a&gt; and Antiochene Syrian ecclesiastical doctrine. Samuel pursued further Syriac studies at &lt;a href=\"Manjanikkara%20Dayara\"&gt;Manjanikkara Dayara&lt;/a&gt; (monastery). He had been attracted there by the presence of the Syrian Metropolitan &lt;a href=\"Elias%20Mar%20Julius\"&gt;Elias Mar Julius&lt;/a&gt;, the delegate of the Patriarch, and the Syrian Deacon and Rabban 'Abdel Ahad (monk), (who later become Patriarch &lt;a href=\"Mor%20Ignatius%20Ya%60qub%20III\"&gt;Mor Ignatius Ya`qub III&lt;/a&gt;). At the time, he had no plans to be ordained. He merely wanted to continue his theological research.\nSamuel did so well academically that in few years he completed his studies. He began to share teaching duties with a colleague, Malpan Dn. Abdul Ahad Remban. Samuel also served as the secretary and translator for the Metropolitan who knew only Arabic and Syriac.\nIn addition to Malayalam, his mother tongue Samuel mastered Sanskrit, Tamil and Hindi the Indian languages and English and continued his private study of both languages. He maintained his command of English by reading books on &lt;a href=\"church%20history\"&gt;church history&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"theology\"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"biblical\"&gt;biblical&lt;/a&gt; and devotional subjects. Besides the above languages and &lt;a href=\"ecclesiastical\"&gt;ecclesiastical&lt;/a&gt; subjects, he mastered &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20language\"&gt;Syriac&lt;/a&gt;, one of the ancient and classical languages and planned for advanced study and research in university level. \nIn 1944, Samuel joined the &lt;a href=\"Union%20Christian%20College%2C%20Aluva\"&gt;Union Christian College&lt;/a&gt; as a priest, thirteen years after he had completed his high school studies, to follow a regular university programme of academic discipline and devoted in study and research for another sixteen years.\nSamuel spent long periods for further research in various academic centres: &lt;a href=\"Serampore%20College\"&gt;Serampore College&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"United%20Theological%20College%2C%20Bangalore\"&gt;United Theological College, Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;; CNI Library, Kottayam and Syriac Library of Pampakkuda all in India; &lt;a href=\"Addis%20Ababa\"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt; Library - &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Bodleian%20Library\"&gt;Bodleian Library&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oxford\"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"British%20Library\"&gt;British Museum Library / British Museum Reading Room&lt;/a&gt;, London; Library of the &lt;a href=\"Bossey%20Ecumenical%20Institute\"&gt;Bossey Ecumenical Institute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;; Library of the Jesuit College, &lt;a href=\"Leuven\"&gt;Louvain&lt;/a&gt;; and the &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20Library\"&gt;Vatican Library&lt;/a&gt;, Rome.\nDoctoral research: Christological controversy.\nWith a background in secular education, Samuel researched anew the History of Christian thought, which he chose for his specialisation; the classical doctrine of the Person of Christ worked out in the fifth century, which led to the first division in the Church that continues today. Samuel's mastery of philosophy, and both &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20language\"&gt;Syriac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, made it possible for him to work with ancient texts and documents to carry on this Alexandrine-&lt;a href=\"Antiochene\"&gt;Antiochene&lt;/a&gt; Christologies very effectively.\nIn choosing this area, Samuel's purpose was ecumenism. The fifth century division in the Church has been interpreted by Church traditions, each in its own way to make out that its acceptance or rejection of the councils in question was the result of a concern to conserve the Christian truth exclusively and the others were really at fault. Samuel's sense of objectivity and impartiality led him to feel that this reading must be as much one-sided as it was superficial, and that he should himself study the issues involved in the controversy. Thus his purpose was, in the first place, to find out him why the division arose, insofar as that was possible. Secondly, perhaps more importantly, to clarify all concerned why the Churches exist in a divide state. In other words, his work was intended to be of service to the Churches and the cause of Christian unity. From this point of view, Samuel had a special concern for the Churches of the East, particularly those of the &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodox\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; family, which have continued in the history without formally acknowledging the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Chalcedon\"&gt;Council of Chalcedon&lt;/a&gt; on 451 A.D. These Church traditions have been referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Monophysitism\"&gt;monophysite&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Heresy\"&gt;heretical&lt;/a&gt; community by the Byzantine or the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; Churches, the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; and the major &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; Churches. In the face of this label of \"heresy\", Samuel felt interested in bringing out the real point of the division following the Council of 451 and the teaching of the fathers who opposed it. Samuel attempted to rescue Oriental Orthodoxy from centuries of intellectual oblivion. The doctoral thesis, \"The Council of Chalcedon Re-examined: A Historical and Theological Survey\" were published worldwide along with several papers. This stand represented the &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodox\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; perspective.\nPost-doctoral research scholar.\nSamuel was a pioneer in these studies. He promoted the concept that the Church in India should be Indian. Out of this concern, he had deep interest in comparing at the roots of the historic faith with the religious heritage of &lt;a href=\"Hinduism\"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;. Secondly, he realised that the claim of Apostolic origin and the identity as &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Thomas%20Christians\"&gt;Syrian Christians&lt;/a&gt; of India, does not tally with its present standing either as part of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; or that of &lt;a href=\"Antiochene\"&gt;Antiochene&lt;/a&gt; Syrian Church. However, from the point of view both these sections of the Indian Christianity could envisualise a common future. Over the years, he promoted the history of the Indian Church and its foreign connections. He took the opportunity to compare them with other ancient Churches, particularly those of the East.\nSamuel's concentration on the nuances of the classical doctrine of the person of Jesus Christ during his postgraduate studies did not leave him free to continue his studies in Hinduism. However, on completing his doctorate at &lt;a href=\"Yale\"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;, an opportunity developed. Dr. P.D. Devanandan was establishing the Christian Institute for the Study of Religion and Society in &lt;a href=\"Bangalore\"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling that an association with the institute might enable him to combine the two plans, he joined it in 1957 under an appointment for the post-doctoral research programme sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. He was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Rockefeller%20Fellowship\"&gt;Rockefeller Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; for a period of three years. This included research for two years in India and one year in Chicago. Besides Indian Philosophy, &lt;a href=\"Sankaracharya\"&gt;Sankaracharya&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Advaita\"&gt;Advaita&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ramanujacharya\"&gt;Ramanujacharya&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Visishtadvaita\"&gt;Visishtadvaita&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Madvacharya\"&gt;Madvacharya&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dvaita%20Vedanta\"&gt;Dvaita Vedanta&lt;/a&gt;, that opportunity helped him to acquire first-hand knowledge of the Philosophy of Swami &lt;a href=\"Vivekananda\"&gt;Vivekananda&lt;/a&gt; and working of the &lt;a href=\"Ramakrishna%20Mission\"&gt;Ramakrishna Mission&lt;/a&gt; as well as of several others in contemporary Indian movements like &lt;a href=\"Mahatma%20Gandhi\"&gt;Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;'s gramaswaraj and &lt;a href=\"Vinoba%20Bhave\"&gt;Vinoba Bhave&lt;/a&gt;'s Bhoodan movement.\nPolyglot.\nSamuel was familiar with fifteen languages including his mother tongue, Malayalam and a scholar in &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20language\"&gt;Syriac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hebrew\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ge%27ez\"&gt;Ge'ez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arabic\"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; which he could teach in seminaries and universities.\nCareer.\nTeaching.\nIn addition to the above, Samuel served as a Professor, guide, and examiner in almost all the Seminaries and Theological Colleges in India, and many abroad.\nEcumenical movement.\nSamuel's presence and contribution in the ecumenical movement in the international arena for three decades. He was an accredited delegate of the Indian Orthodox Church at four of the General Assemblies of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Council%20of%20Churches\"&gt;World Council of Churches&lt;/a&gt;:\nFaith and Order Commission.\nThe New Delhi World Assembly of &lt;a href=\"World%20Council%20of%20Churches\"&gt;World Council of Churches&lt;/a&gt; in 1961 voted Samuel as a member of the Council's &lt;a href=\"Faith%20and%20Order%20Commission\"&gt;Faith and Order Commission&lt;/a&gt;. He held that position until 1984. The fourth general assembly of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Council%20of%20Churches\"&gt;WCC&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Uppsala\"&gt;Uppsala&lt;/a&gt; in 1968, elected him as a member of the Commission's Working Committee and later in its steering committee. His active participation in the meetings of Faith and Order Commission was very significant and giving expressions for the importance of church unity. His paper in the Faith and Order meeting at Accra 1974 on the subject \"How can the Unity of the Church be Achieved\" he points to the influence of \"different intellectual and cultural backgrounds\" in the evolution the different church traditions, awareness of which should help relativise these traditions. He was a participant of seven meetings of the Commission.\nJoint commissions.\nSamuel took a part in a number of study projects and joint commissions of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox\"&gt;Eastern Orthodox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodox\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; Churches. The papers presented took an interest in discussing the issues from an &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodox\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; perspective. The papers were published under the auspices of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Council%20of%20Churches\"&gt;World Council of Churches&lt;/a&gt;:\nDialogue between Eastern and Oriental Orthodox theologians.\nThe period of Samuel's association with the &lt;a href=\"Faith%20and%20Order%20Commission\"&gt;Faith and Order Commission&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"World%20Council%20of%20Churches\"&gt;World Council of Churches&lt;/a&gt; coincided with two progresses where he made a valuable and lasting contribution. Those were \"Unofficial Consultation of Theologians of the Eastern and &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodox%20Churches\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox Churches&lt;/a&gt;\" held in &lt;a href=\"Arhus\"&gt;Arhus&lt;/a&gt;-1964, &lt;a href=\"Bristol\"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;-1967, &lt;a href=\"Geneva\"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt;-1970 and &lt;a href=\"Addis%20Ababa\"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;-1971. Samuel presented papers at all of them and helped the participants in arriving at the conclusion that the difference in Christological Doctrine between the two families of Churches was only verbal and not substantial. These papers and joint agreed statements have been published in different journals.\nDialogue between Catholic and Oriental Orthodox theologians.\nThe second was a series of four consultations organised by the Pro Oriente Foundation of Vienna, Austria in 1972. These were called \"Unofficial Consultations of Theologians of the &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodox%20Churches\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox Churches&lt;/a&gt;\". Samuel participated in them as an Orthodox theologian, presenting papers that were published under the auspices of the Pro Oriente Foundation. The first three of the consultations discussed the doctrine of the Person of &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Christ\"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;, on which there was agreement among participants that the difference between two Church traditions was not substantial. \nStarting in 1964, Samuel took part in almost all the various meetings of the Unofficial Consultation of Theologians of Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches presenting papers, participated in the discussions, and drafting out for the agreed statements. He has served as a member of a group called together by the &lt;a href=\"Faith%20and%20Order%20Commission\"&gt;Faith and Order Commission&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Council%20of%20Churches\"&gt;World Council of Churches&lt;/a&gt; for a study, first of the Councils of early Church, and later of the Council of Chalcedon. The papers presented were published in the \"Greek Orthodox Theological Review\", &lt;a href=\"Brookline%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Brookline, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, United States, \"Wort und Worhiet\", &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Oriente\"&gt;Pro Oriente&lt;/a&gt;, Vienna, \"Ecumenical Review\", &lt;a href=\"World%20Council%20of%20Churches\"&gt;World Council of Churches&lt;/a&gt;, Geneva and \"Abba Salama\", &lt;a href=\"Addis%20Ababa\"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Samuel's lifelong search for truth and the meticulous outcome helped to pave the way for a closer understanding, better relationship between the Chalcedonian and Non Chalcedonian Christendom, after a period of fifteen centuries of split and schism.\nEthiopian life.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ethiopian%20Orthodox%20Tewahedo%20Church\"&gt;Church of Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; and Haile Selassie I University (since renamed &lt;a href=\"Addis%20Ababa%20University\"&gt;Addis Ababa University&lt;/a&gt;) persuaded Samuel to return to Ethiopia. The college appointed him Dean of the Theological College of the Holy Trinity in 1969, a position that he held until he left Ethiopia in July 1976. He also served as the Secretary of the Faculty Council of the University.\nThe Great Conference of Oriental Orthodox Churches.\nSamuel helped organise the Conference of the Oriental Orthodox Churches with the initiative of both the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Haile%20Selassie%20I%20of%20Ethiopia\"&gt;Haile Selassie I&lt;/a&gt; and the acting Patriarch of Ethiopia, Abune Theophilus (later Patriarch). The conference brought together the five &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodox%20Churches\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox Churches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coptic%20Orthodox\"&gt;Coptic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Syriac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;n, &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;n and Indian, which were isolated after the fifth century.\nHe was a member of the local committee and General Coordinator, responsible for the preparatory work of the &lt;a href=\"Addis%20Ababa\"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt; Conference of the Heads of &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodox%20Churches\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox Churches&lt;/a&gt;, which held in January 1965. He was also one of the delegates along with the likes of &lt;a href=\"Fr.%20T.%20C.%20Jacob\"&gt;Fr. T. C. Jacob&lt;/a&gt; in the Conference with the &lt;a href=\"Catholicos%20Baselios%20Augen%20I\"&gt;Catholicos Baselios Augen I&lt;/a&gt; and others representing &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Indian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;. He edited the report of the Conference and published it by the interim committee.\nAssociation of Ethio-Hellenic Studies.\nSamuel entered into a programme initiated by Methodios Fouyas, the Metropolitan of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Greek Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aksum\"&gt;Aksum&lt;/a&gt;, founding the Association of Ethio-Hellenic Studies. Samuel was the Vice-President of it, and Editorial Board of the publications 'Abba Salama' and the 'Ecliastca Fharan', in English, &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amharic\"&gt;Amharic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ge%27ez\"&gt;Ge'ez&lt;/a&gt; languages.\nWider Ecumenism in the Indian context.\nSamuel played a major role in persuading the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Indian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; to abandon its old policy of isolation from other church traditions in India, and to join the Kerala Christian Council, the National Council of Churches, and the joint commission of &lt;a href=\"Catholic\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oriental%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Oriental Orthodox&lt;/a&gt; Churches. V.C. Samuel, throughout his life, expressed his desire to see the unity of the Indian churches that belong to the Syrian tradition. Unity with the 'Jacobite Faction' of the Indian Orthodox Church was given priority. Besides an ecumenical unity even with the churches belonging to the Protestant tradition was also envisaged. As an Indian Christian V.C Samuel advocated the need of fostering wider ecumenism with other faiths in general and Hinduism in particular.\nMinistry in the Indian (Malankara) Orthodox Church.\nOrdained at the age of twenty-five Samuel continued his ministry in the Indian Orthodox Church for a period of six decades:\nAmbassador of the Indian Church.\nThe church planned to consecrate him as a bishop in the early 1950s. He declined this honour in favour of pursuing ecumenism through academia.\nIn 1968, the Catholicose Baselius Ougen I, the Head of the &lt;a href=\"Malankara%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Malankara Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; appointed Samuel as the Ambassador to Ethiopia and other African Countries.\nDoctor of the Church.\nIn 1991, Professor Samuel Chandanappally published \"Malankara Sabha Pithakkanmar\" (Fathers of the Malankara Church). The book listed Samuel as the greatest Doctor of the Indian Church.\nDeath.\nSamuel died in the early morning of Wednesday 18, November 1998 at his residence in Bangalore. Funeral service was conducted on 20th Friday at St. Gregorios Cathedral where he had served. Bishops Philipose Mar Eusebius and Mathews Mar Severus, his former students, led the service assisted by hundreds of Priests. Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews II, who was unable to attend due to hospitalization, flew directly to Bangalore after his discharge from the hospital on 22nd morning and conducted Thanksgiving Holy Qurbana at the Cathedral, and delivered a memorial.\nBibliography.\nSamuel published in India and abroad.
