    "text": "The Razer Hydra (previously known as Sixense TrueMotion) is a &lt;a href=\"Motion%20controller\"&gt;motion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orientation%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;orientation&lt;/a&gt; detection &lt;a href=\"game%20controller\"&gt;game controller&lt;/a&gt; developed by Sixense Entertainment, a company founded in 2007, in partnership with &lt;a href=\"Razer%20USA\"&gt;Razer USA&lt;/a&gt;. It uses a weak &lt;a href=\"magnetic%20field\"&gt;magnetic field&lt;/a&gt; to detect the absolute position and orientation of the controllers with a precision, as stated by its developers, of 1\u00a0mm and 1\u00b0; it has &lt;a href=\"six%20degrees%20of%20freedom\"&gt;six degrees of freedom&lt;/a&gt;. The current release is wired, but a wireless version was in development.\nThe game controller has been showcased many times with different video games and 3D modeling applications, most prominently ', \"&lt;a href=\"Portal%202\"&gt;Portal 2&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Team%20Fortress%202\"&gt;Team Fortress 2&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Left%204%20Dead%202\"&gt;Left 4 Dead 2&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Goo\"&gt;World of Goo&lt;/a&gt;\", ' and \"&lt;a href=\"Half-Life%202\"&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nA partnership with &lt;a href=\"Valve%20Corporation\"&gt;Valve&lt;/a&gt; was announced, and said company appears as a partner, alongside Razer and &lt;a href=\"Intel\"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;. No word has been said by the game developer but they helped Valve modify \"Left 4 Dead 2\" and other Valve games to be played with the Razer Hydra Motion control, and an official SDK is available for download in Steam's 'Tools' page.\nIt was subject to a demo under the name Sixense Truemotion and tested to a close &lt;a href=\"focus%20group\"&gt;focus group&lt;/a&gt; of PlayStation Underground Members in August 2008, where its full functionality in various types of &lt;a href=\"Video%20game\"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; was shown.\nIt is now called the Razer Hydra and has been released through Steam and Razer's official website on June 16, 2011, for &lt;a href=\"US%24\"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;139.99. It is being sold in a bundle with \"&lt;a href=\"Portal%202\"&gt;Portal 2&lt;/a&gt;\", which has exclusive content for those with the controller. Support for many other games is either implemented or planned. According to a forum post, from December 2010, Sixense is also working on musical control with the controller.\n\"Portal 2\".\nThe Razer Hydra comes bundled with an enhanced version of \"&lt;a href=\"Portal%202\"&gt;Portal 2&lt;/a&gt;\". It features a more advanced portal gun with new gameplay mechanics. One new ability is Portal Surfing, which lets the portal gun drag, move and rotate either portal after it has been created. Another is 1-to-1 mode with the portal gun's object carrying beam, which lets you extend the beam many metres and freely move and rotate the carried object in 6 degrees of freedom.\nIt includes the full \"Portal 2\" game, plus a new set of tutorial levels to teach the new mechanics, and two more sets of levels based around the new mechanics.\nThe default controls for the game allow the player to look around, or move and rotate the carried object or portal, by moving their right hand. Flicking the left hand up, or pressing a button on the right controller, makes you jump. The left analog stick controls movement. The triggers fire or move portals."
