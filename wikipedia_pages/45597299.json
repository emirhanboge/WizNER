    "text": "Errol Stanley Sawyer (August 8, 1943 - December 24, 2020) was an American photographer who lived and worked the last twenty two years of his life in &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam\"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nSawyer was born in Miami, Florida, to parents &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Earl%20Sawyer\"&gt;Robert Earl Sawyer&lt;/a&gt; (1923\u201394) and Mamie Lucille Donaldson (1928\u20132009). His father was an African American playwright, actor, director and producer whose family emigrated from Nassau, Bahamas, to Miami. His mother, an African American-&lt;a href=\"Cherokee\"&gt;Cherokee&lt;/a&gt; Indian originally from Bainbridge, Georgia, was head of the Intensive Care Unit of the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center in The Bronx, New York City, for 25 years. She had a passion for theatre.\nIn 1950, Sawyer moved with his mother and sister Wanda from Miami to Harlem, New York City, and three years later to The Bronx. In 1961, he graduated from &lt;a href=\"James%20Monroe%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29\"&gt;James Monroe High School&lt;/a&gt;. From 1962 to 1966, he studied history and political science at &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20University\"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt;. Nearby &lt;a href=\"Greenwich%20Village\"&gt;Greenwich Village&lt;/a&gt; exposed him to another world of art and culture, and to &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt;, which has remained a passion for him. According to Sawyer, the &lt;a href=\"Woodstock\"&gt;Woodstock&lt;/a&gt; Festival, in 1969, had a big impact on his career path. He was in the 1960s a regular at Mickey Ruskin's club &lt;a href=\"Max%27s%20Kansas%20City\"&gt;Max's Kansas City&lt;/a&gt;, where he met &lt;a href=\"Jimi%20Hendrix\"&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Rauschenberg\"&gt;Robert Rauschenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Larry%20Rivers\"&gt;Larry Rivers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claes%20Oldenburg\"&gt;Claes Oldenburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Warhol\"&gt;Andy Warhol&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Diane%20Arbus\"&gt;Diane Arbus&lt;/a&gt;. Arbus would later make a portrait of him in her studio.\nCareer.\nIn 1968, Sawyer found his vocation as a photographer while traveling in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. His first camera was a &lt;a href=\"Kowa%20%28company%29\"&gt;Kowa&lt;/a&gt;. His first professional job came in 1971 in London. Sawyer has cited photographers James Moore, Bill Silano, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Avedon\"&gt;Richard Avedon&lt;/a&gt;, and Gosta Peterson as influences.\nIn the early 1970s, Sawyer lived and worked in Paris and London. His photographs were published in magazines such as \"&lt;a href=\"D%C3%A9p%C3%AAche%20Mode\"&gt;D\u00e9p\u00eache Mode&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Elle%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Elle&lt;/a&gt;\", and French \"&lt;a href=\"Vogue%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Vogue&lt;/a&gt;\". He photographed the African-American painter &lt;a href=\"Beauford%20Delaney\"&gt;Beauford Delaney&lt;/a&gt; and the American actresses &lt;a href=\"Patti%20D%27Arbanville\"&gt;Patti D'Arbanville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jessica%20Lange\"&gt;Jessica Lange&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Schneider%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Maria Schneider&lt;/a&gt; in Paris. In 1973, he discovered the American model &lt;a href=\"Christie%20Brinkley\"&gt;Christie Brinkley&lt;/a&gt;, took her first modeling photos and convinced &lt;a href=\"John%20Casablancas\"&gt;John Casablancas&lt;/a&gt; to accept her at &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Model%20Management\"&gt;Elite Model Management&lt;/a&gt; in Paris.\nIn 1978, Sawyer returned to New York and worked for magazines such as \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Magazine\"&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\", \"Working Women\" and US \"&lt;a href=\"Vogue%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Vogue&lt;/a&gt;\". He did beauty campaigns for &lt;a href=\"Avon%20Products\"&gt;Avon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germaine%20Monteil\"&gt;Germaine Monteil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Max%20Factor\"&gt;Max Factor&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time he continued his &lt;a href=\"street%20photography\"&gt;street photography&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince 1984, Sawyer has worked on commercial assignments and has done multicultural beauty projects for &lt;a href=\"L%27Or%C3%A9al\"&gt;L'Or\u00e9al&lt;/a&gt; and \"Vis-A-Vis Magazine\". However, most of his time is spent on documentary and fine art photography, primarily black and white photographs in the streets of New York, Paris, and Amsterdam. His fine art pictures have been published in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sun%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"ZoneZero\"&gt;ZoneZero&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Pedro%20Meyer\"&gt;Pedro Meyer&lt;/a&gt;, \"PF Magazine\", and \"Filosofie Magazine\" in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 2006 until 2010, Sawyer was a guest professor of photography at &lt;a href=\"Technical%20University%20Delft\"&gt;Technical University Delft&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands.\nIn 2010, his photo book \"City Mosaic\" was published. The book contains 64 black &amp; white images divided into three chapters: \"Graffiti,\" \"Portraits &amp; City Scenes\" and \"Perspectives.\" Writing the book's introduction, photography critic &lt;a href=\"A.%20D.%20Coleman\"&gt;A. D. Coleman&lt;/a&gt; describes the work as \"close to four decades worth of engagement with the classic mode of mainstream-modernist street photography. Consistent in quality, in terms of both craft and content, it speaks in its own voice, aware of the tradition on which it builds but not noticeably beholden to any predecessor therein.\"\nStyle.\nAccording to Sawyer, \"a picture is good when it leaves room for you to imagine.\" He aims to provoke the viewer to look more closely at everyday situations that may otherwise be overlooked. He photographs people, graffiti, and perspectives in public and semi-public space, such as parks, streets, and underground stations.\nWriting for \"PF Magazine\", critic Herman Hoeneveld remarked \"Errol Sawyer could be justifiably called a cultural philosopher who seems to press for consciousness and contemplation. He calls on our common sense to not allow our feelings to be crushed by the unbridled rush for consumption.\"\nArt critic and former museum director &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Spalding\"&gt;Julian Spalding&lt;/a&gt; described Sawyer as \"a classical black and white photographer in the &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Cartier-Bresson\"&gt;Henri Cartier-Bresson&lt;/a&gt; tradition, using the camera at its simplest and most challenging, as a trap for catching time.\" Writing for the &lt;a href=\"World%20Socialist%20Web%20Site\"&gt;World Socialist Web Site&lt;/a&gt;, painter &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Phillips%20%28American%20painter%29\"&gt;Richard Phillips&lt;/a&gt; remarked \"Errol Sawyer is a rare figure in contemporary photography: someone who worked in the often faddish and superficial world of high-end commercial photography but still retains his artistic integrity and creative spirit.\"\nExhibitions.\nSawyer has held solo exhibitions at:"
