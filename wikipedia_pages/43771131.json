He only played 13 games during the 2012 &lt;a href=\"National%20Youth%20Competition%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;National Youth Competition&lt;/a&gt; season, with a fractured &lt;a href=\"fibula\"&gt;fibula&lt;/a&gt; in Round 13. Nevertheless, the 19-year-old scored eight tries from those 13 games. Solomona joined the Melbourne Storm's senior squad in &lt;a href=\"2013%20Melbourne%20Storm%20season\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolomona signed for &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"London%20Broncos\"&gt;London Broncos&lt;/a&gt; in January 2014 after being released from his contract with &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Storm\"&gt;Melbourne Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Following the club's relegation, it was announced that he would join &lt;a href=\"Castleford%20Tigers\"&gt;Castleford Tigers&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the season.\nIn 2016, Solomona scored a record-breaking 37th try in a single &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt; season in Castleford's Super 8s win over Catalans. The try broke a 12-year record held by former dual-international, &lt;a href=\"Lesley%20Vainikolo\"&gt;Lesley Vainikolo&lt;/a&gt;.

The move was subject to a legal dispute which was concluded out of court as Sale paid Castleford some \u00a3200,000 in compensation. On 29 March 2017, having enjoyed a prolific start to his career with Sale (10 tries in 11 appearances), Solomona declared himself available for international selection with &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. He was subsequently called up to the senior England squad by &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Jones%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;Eddie Jones&lt;/a&gt; for their 2017 summer tour of Argentina and came on as a sub in the opening test and scored the winning try on his debut.l\nInfluences.\nSolomona feels that meeting senior players can be important for the motivation and development of school age players."
