    "text": "Hazael (; ; &lt;a href=\"Aramaic%20language\"&gt;Aramaic&lt;/a&gt;: \u05d7\u05d6\u05d0\u05dc, from the &lt;a href=\"triliteral\"&gt;triliteral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Semitic%20root\"&gt;Semitic root&lt;/a&gt; \"h-z-y\", \"to see\"; his full name meaning, \"&lt;a href=\"El%20%28deity%29\"&gt;El&lt;/a&gt;/God has seen\"; ) was an &lt;a href=\"Aram%20Damascus\"&gt;Aramean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Monarch\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; who is mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Bible\"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt;. Under his reign, &lt;a href=\"Aram-Damascus\"&gt;Aram-Damascus&lt;/a&gt; became an empire that ruled over large parts of &lt;a href=\"Syria%20%28region%29\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. While he was likely born in the greater &lt;a href=\"Damascus\"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt; region of today, his exact place of birth is still controversial, with both &lt;a href=\"Bashan\"&gt;Bashan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Beqaa%20Valley\"&gt;Beqaa Valley&lt;/a&gt; being favoured by different historians.\nIn the Bible.\nHazael is first mentioned by name in . God tells &lt;a href=\"Elijah\"&gt;Elijah&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"prophet\"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt; of God to anoint Hazael king over Syria. Years after this, the Syrian king Ben-Hadad II, probably identical to &lt;a href=\"Hadadezer\"&gt;Hadadezer&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in the Tel Dan Stele, was ill and sent his court official Hazael with gifts to Elijah's successor, &lt;a href=\"Elisha\"&gt;Elisha&lt;/a&gt;. Elisha told Hazael to tell Hadadezer that he would recover, and he revealed to Hazael that the king would recover but would die of other means. He also predicted that Hazael would commit atrocities against the Israelites. Hazael denies that he is capable of perpetrating such deeds. The next day, he returned to &lt;a href=\"Damascus\"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;, suffocated Hadadezer and seized power himself.\nDuring his reign (c. 842\u2013800 BCE), King Hazael led the Arameans in battle against the forces of King &lt;a href=\"Jehoram%20of%20Israel\"&gt;Jehoram of Israel&lt;/a&gt; and King &lt;a href=\"Ahaziah%20of%20Judah\"&gt;Ahaziah of Judah&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating them at &lt;a href=\"Ramoth-Gilead\"&gt;Ramoth-Gilead&lt;/a&gt;, Hazael repelled two attacks by the &lt;a href=\"Assyria\"&gt;Assyria&lt;/a&gt;ns, seized Israelite territory east of the &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20River\"&gt;Jordan River&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Philistine\"&gt;Philistine&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Gath%20%28city%29\"&gt;Gath&lt;/a&gt;. Although unsuccessful, he also sought to take &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; (). Hazael's death is mentioned in .\nTel Dan Stele.\n&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Dan%20Stele\"&gt;A monumental Aramaic inscription&lt;/a&gt; discovered at &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Dan\"&gt;Tel Dan&lt;/a&gt; is seen by most scholars as having been erected by Hazael, after he defeated the Kings of Israel and Judah. Recent excavations at &lt;a href=\"Tell%20es-Safi\"&gt;Tell es-Safi&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Gath%20%28city%29\"&gt;Gath&lt;/a&gt; have revealed dramatic evidence of the siege and subsequent conquest of Gath by Hazael. The destruction of the settlement at &lt;a href=\"Tell%20Zeitah\"&gt;Tell Zeitah&lt;/a&gt; during the ninth century may also be the result of Hazael's campaign. King &lt;a href=\"Joash%20of%20Judah\"&gt;Joash of Judah&lt;/a&gt; forestalled Hazael's invasion by bribing him with treasure from the royal palace and temple.\nItems belonging to Hazael.\nBronze plaques.\nDecorated bronze plaques from chariot horse-harness taken from Hazael, identified by their inscriptions, have been found as re-gifted &lt;a href=\"votive%20object\"&gt;votive object&lt;/a&gt;s at two Greek sites, the &lt;a href=\"Heraion%20of%20Samos\"&gt;Heraion of Samos&lt;/a&gt; and in the temple of Apollo at &lt;a href=\"Eretria\"&gt;Eretria&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Euboea\"&gt;Euboea&lt;/a&gt;. The inscriptions read \"that which &lt;a href=\"Hadad\"&gt;Hadad&lt;/a&gt; gave to our lord Hazael from 'Umq in the year that our lord crossed the River\". The river must be the &lt;a href=\"Orontes%20river\"&gt;Orontes&lt;/a&gt;. The triangular front pieces show a \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20the%20animals\"&gt;Master of the animals&lt;/a&gt;\" gripping inverted sphinxes or lions in either hand, and with goddesses who stand on the heads of lions. When &lt;a href=\"Tiglath-Pileser%20III\"&gt;Tiglath-Pileser III&lt;/a&gt; took Damascus in 733/2, these heirlooms were part of the loot that fell eventually into Greek, probably &lt;a href=\"Euboea\"&gt;Euboea&lt;/a&gt;n hands.\nArslan Tash ivories.\nA set of ivory bed decorations were found in 1928 in &lt;a href=\"Arslan%20Tash\"&gt;Arslan Tash&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; (ancient Had\u0101tu) by a team of French archaeologists. Among them is the &lt;a href=\"Arslan%20Tash%20ivory%20inscription\"&gt;Arslan Tash ivory inscription&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aramaic%20language\"&gt;Aramaic language&lt;/a&gt; that carries the name 'Hazael'; this bed seems to have belonged to king Hazael of Aram-Damascus. The inscription is known as KAI 232.\nAlso, some fragmentary ivories mentioning Hazael were found in &lt;a href=\"Nimrud\"&gt;Nimrud&lt;/a&gt;, in Iraq."
