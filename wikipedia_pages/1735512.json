    "text": "Milne Bay is a province of &lt;a href=\"Papua%20New%20Guinea\"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;. Its capital is &lt;a href=\"Alotau\"&gt;Alotau&lt;/a&gt;. The province covers 14,345\u00a0km\u00b2 of land and 252,990\u00a0km\u00b2 of sea, within the province there are more than 600 islands, about 160 of which are inhabited. The province has about 276,000 inhabitants, speaking about 48 languages, most of which belong to the Eastern Malayo-Polynesian branch of the &lt;a href=\"Austronesian%20language\"&gt;Austronesian language&lt;/a&gt; family. Economically the province is dependent upon tourism, &lt;a href=\"oil%20palm\"&gt;oil palm&lt;/a&gt;, and gold mining on Misima Island; in addition to these larger industries there are many small-scale village projects in &lt;a href=\"Theobroma%20cacao\"&gt;cocoa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"copra\"&gt;copra&lt;/a&gt; cultivation. The &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Milne Bay&lt;/a&gt; took place in the province.\nCulturally the &lt;a href=\"Milne%20Bay\"&gt;Milne Bay&lt;/a&gt; region is sometimes referred to as \"the Massim,\" a term originating from the name of &lt;a href=\"Misima%20Island\"&gt;Misima Island&lt;/a&gt;. Massim societies are usually characterized by &lt;a href=\"matrilineal\"&gt;matrilineal&lt;/a&gt; descent, elaborate mortuary sequences and complex systems of ritual exchange including the &lt;a href=\"Kula%20ring\"&gt;Kula ring&lt;/a&gt;. From Island group to Island group and even between close lying islands, the local culture changes remarkably. What is socially acceptable on one island may not be so on another.\nGeography.\nThe &lt;a href=\"coral%20reef\"&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt; systems of Milne Bay are some of the most &lt;a href=\"biodiverse\"&gt;biodiverse&lt;/a&gt; in the world, and as such attract equal attention from dive operators and conservation groups. The D'Entrecasteaux Islands still have volcanic activity, especially around Dobu and Fergusson Islands.\nThe waters from the Amphlett group to the Trobriand Islands are poorly charted, and, as a result, are rarely visited by tourists or yachts passing through. On the other hand, the Louissiade Archipelago is a stopover for yachts travelling around the world and ones visiting from Australia. However, the area sees few general tourists. The gold mine at Misima is no longer operational. Mining ended at Misima in 2001, with stockpile milling continuing into 2004. During its life, Misima has produced over 3.7Moz of gold and 18Moz of silver. Operations now are mainly focused on &lt;a href=\"mine%20closure\"&gt;mine closure&lt;/a&gt; requirements and environmental rehabilitation. There is also on-going prospecting in Woodlark Island and Mwatebu, Normanby Island.\nIslands.\nIslands in Milne Bay Province include:\nAdministratively, there are four districts:\nDemographics.\nAs of the early 20th century, Milne Bay peoples lived in small &lt;a href=\"hamlet%20%28place%29\"&gt;hamlet&lt;/a&gt;s, which were dominated by &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s. Most clans consisted of relatives, with an integration of adopted and individuals who married into the clan from other clans. Relocation of hamlets was commons, where one, two or three hamlets might combine and relocate together. The culture, was of that time, was &lt;a href=\"matrilineal\"&gt;matrilineal&lt;/a&gt;. Each clan had a &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt; animal it identified as its own. Totems included snakes, a lizard, a fish, or a bird. One clan, the Tubetube clan, had a non-animal, with a plant as its totem. The snake was identified as one of the most powerful of the totems, as is the bird. People were known for asking \"what is your bird?\" in reference to what clan someone was a member of. Clans did not build &lt;a href=\"shrine\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt;s to represent their totems, and people didn't believe to have special power or influence over the animals representing their totems. As of 1904, people were occasionally maintaining the creatures representing their clans as pets, which may have been introduced by Europeans. Bird totem creatures are not considered food.\nHistorically, community members practiced &lt;a href=\"exogamy\"&gt;exogamy&lt;/a&gt;, which protected clan members from having sexual relations with members of the same clan.\nArts and culture.\n&lt;a href=\"Wood%20carving\"&gt;Wood carving&lt;/a&gt;, historically, has been an important art of the Milne Bay area. The Milne Bay peoples created &lt;a href=\"canoe\"&gt;canoe&lt;/a&gt;s, called \"waga\". When &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Gabriel%20Seligman\"&gt;Charles Gabriel Seligman&lt;/a&gt; visited the area in 1904, he described the \"waga\" as playing \"such an important part in the life of the district,\" and being a \"&lt;a href=\"decorative%20art\"&gt;decorative art&lt;/a&gt;\" that has \"reached its highest expression in the carvings of the ornaments for the &lt;a href=\"prow\"&gt;prow&lt;/a&gt;s of the \"waga\".\" He also noted that they used similar designs on &lt;a href=\"gourd\"&gt;gourd&lt;/a&gt;s from lime trees.\n&lt;a href=\"Basket%20weaving\"&gt;Basket weaving&lt;/a&gt; was also common, with baskets called \"sinapopo\" being particularly representative of wealth in the region, to the point where they are buried with their owners upon death. &lt;a href=\"Pottery\"&gt;Pottery&lt;/a&gt; was also common, specifically amongst the Tubetube, Ware and other tribes. &lt;a href=\"Adze\"&gt;Adze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s were also common, for functional and ceremonial purposes. The people of &lt;a href=\"Woodlark%20Island\"&gt;Woodlark Island&lt;/a&gt; were known for their axes. &lt;a href=\"Spear\"&gt;Spear&lt;/a&gt;s and arrows were also used for weapons.\nGovernance.\nDistricts and LLGs.\nEach province in Papua New Guinea has one or more districts, and each district has one or more Local Level Government (LLG) areas. For &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards and those into census units.\nProvincial leaders.\nThe province was governed by a decentralised provincial administration, headed by a Premier, from 1978 to 1995. Following reforms taking effect that year, the national government reassumed some powers, and the role of Premier was replaced by a position of Governor, to be held by the winner of the province-wide seat in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Parliament%20of%20Papua%20New%20Guinea\"&gt;National Parliament of Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers of the National Parliament.\nThe province and each district is represented by a Member of the &lt;a href=\"National%20Parliament%20of%20Papua%20New%20Guinea\"&gt;National Parliament&lt;/a&gt;. There is one provincial &lt;a href=\"electoral%20district\"&gt;electorate&lt;/a&gt; and each district is an open electorate.\nPopular culture.\nMiriam Kahn's \"Always Hungry Never Greedy: food and the expression of gender in a Melanesian society,\" is set in a village in Milne Bay."
