It was located in southwest &lt;a href=\"Caria\"&gt;Caria&lt;/a&gt;, on an advantageous site on the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20G%C3%B6kova\"&gt;Gulf of G\u00f6kova&lt;/a&gt;, which is now in &lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. The city was famous for the &lt;a href=\"Mausoleum%20of%20Halicarnassus\"&gt;Mausoleum of Halicarnassus&lt;/a&gt;, also known simply as the Tomb of &lt;a href=\"Mausolus\"&gt;Mausolus&lt;/a&gt;, whose name provided the origin of the word \"&lt;a href=\"mausoleum\"&gt;mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;\". The mausoleum, built from 353 to 350\u00a0BC, ranked as one of the &lt;a href=\"seven%20wonders%20of%20the%20ancient%20world\"&gt;seven wonders of the ancient world&lt;/a&gt;.\nHalicarnassus' history was special on two interlinked issues. Halicarnassus retained a monarchical system of government at a time when most other Greek city states had long since rid themselves of their kings. And secondly, while their Ionian neighbours rebelled against Persian rule, Halicarnassus remained loyal to the Persians and formed part of the &lt;a href=\"Achaemenid%20Empire\"&gt;Persian Empire&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20the%20Great\"&gt;Alexander the Great&lt;/a&gt; captured it at the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Halicarnassus\"&gt;siege of Halicarnassus&lt;/a&gt; in 333\u00a0BC.\nZephyria was the original name of the settlement, and the present site of the great &lt;a href=\"Bodrum%20Castle\"&gt;Castle of St. Peter&lt;/a&gt; built by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Rhodes\"&gt;Knights of Rhodes&lt;/a&gt; in 1404 AD. It was built on what was originally an island, which gradually expanded to include several Carian settlements on the mainland. However, in the course of time, the island topographically united with the mainland, and the city was extended to combine with the existing &lt;a href=\"Salmacis%20%28Caria%29\"&gt;Salmacis&lt;/a&gt;, an older town of the native &lt;a href=\"Leleges\"&gt;Leleges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Carians\"&gt;Carians&lt;/a&gt;, and site of the later citadel. The first settlers were originally Dorians from the Peloponnese, but this was soon forgotten. \nEtymology.\nThe suffix -\u1fb1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 (-assos) of Greek \u1f09\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u1fb1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 is indicative of a &lt;a href=\"Pre-Greek%20substrate\"&gt;substrate&lt;/a&gt; toponym, meaning that an original non-Greek name influenced, or established the place's name. (Compare &lt;a href=\"Parnassus\"&gt;Parnassus&lt;/a&gt;.) It has been recently proposed that the element -\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u1fb1\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 is &lt;a href=\"cognate\"&gt;cognate&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Luwian%20language\"&gt;Luwian&lt;/a&gt; (CASTRUM)ha+ra/i-na-s\u00e0 / (CASTRUM)ha+ra/i-ni-s\u00e0 'fortress'. If so, the toponym is probably borrowed from &lt;a href=\"Carian%20language\"&gt;Carian&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Anatolian%20languages%23Luwic%20branch\"&gt;Luwic language&lt;/a&gt; spoken alongside Greek in Halicarnassus. The Carian name for Halicarnassus has been tentatively identified with \ud800\udea0\ud800\udea3\ud800\udeab\ud800\udeb0 \ud800\udeb4\ud800\udea0\ud800\udea5\ud800\udeb5\ud800\udeab\ud800\udeb0 (\"alos k\u0302arnos)\" in inscriptions.\nHistory.\nMycenaean presence in the area.\nSome large &lt;a href=\"Mycenae\"&gt;Mycenae&lt;/a&gt;an tombs have been found at Musgebi (or Muskebi, modern &lt;a href=\"Ortakent\"&gt;Ortakent&lt;/a&gt;), not far from Halicarnassus. According to Turkish archaeologist Yusuf Boysal, the Muskebi material, dating from the end of the fifteenth century BC to ca. 1200 BC, provides evidence of the presence, in this region, of a Mycenaean settlement.\nMore than forty burial places dating back to that time have been discovered. A rich collection of artifacts found in these tombs is now housed in the &lt;a href=\"Bodrum%20Castle\"&gt;Bodrum Castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese finds cast some light on the problem of determining the territories of ancient &lt;a href=\"Arzawa\"&gt;Arzawa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Achaeans%20%28Homer%29\"&gt;Ahhiyawa&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly history.\nThe founding of Halicarnassus is debated among various traditions; but they agree in the main point as to its being a &lt;a href=\"Dorians\"&gt;Dorian&lt;/a&gt; colony, and the figures on its coins, such as the head of &lt;a href=\"Medusa%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Medusa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athena\"&gt;Athena&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Poseidon\"&gt;Poseidon&lt;/a&gt;, or the trident, support the statement that the mother cities were &lt;a href=\"Troezen\"&gt;Troezen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argos%2C%20Peloponnese\"&gt;Argos&lt;/a&gt;. The inhabitants appear to have accepted Anthes, a son of Poseidon, as their legendary founder, as mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Strabo\"&gt;Strabo&lt;/a&gt;, and were proud of the title of \"Antheadae\".\nAt an early period Halicarnassus was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Doric%20Hexapolis\"&gt;Doric Hexapolis&lt;/a&gt;, which included &lt;a href=\"Kos\"&gt;Kos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cnidus\"&gt;Cnidus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lindos\"&gt;Lindos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kameiros\"&gt;Kameiros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ialysus\"&gt;Ialysus&lt;/a&gt;; but it was expelled from the league when one of its citizens, Agasicles, took home the prize tripod which he had won in the Triopian games, instead of dedicating it according to custom to the Triopian Apollo. In the early 5th century BC Halicarnassus was under the sway of &lt;a href=\"Artemisia%20I%20of%20Caria\"&gt;Artemisia I of Caria&lt;/a&gt; (also known as Artemesia of Halicarnassus), who made herself famous as a naval commander at the &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Salamis\"&gt;battle of Salamis&lt;/a&gt;. Of Pisindalis, her son and successor, little is known. Artemisia's grandson &lt;a href=\"Lygdamis%20II%20of%20Halicarnassus\"&gt;Lygdamis II of Halicarnassus&lt;/a&gt;, is notorious for having put to death the poet &lt;a href=\"Panyasis\"&gt;Panyasis&lt;/a&gt; and causing &lt;a href=\"Herodotus\"&gt;Herodotus&lt;/a&gt;, possibly the best known Halicarnassian, to leave his native city (c. 457\u00a0BC).\nHekatomnid dynasty.\n&lt;a href=\"Hecatomnus\"&gt;Hecatomnus&lt;/a&gt; became king of Caria, at that time part of the Persian Empire, ruling from 404\u00a0BC to 358\u00a0BC and establishing the Hekatomnid dynasty. He left three sons, Mausolus, &lt;a href=\"Idrieus\"&gt;Idrieus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pixodarus%20of%20Caria\"&gt;Pixodarus&lt;/a&gt;\u2014all of whom\u2014in their turn, succeeded him in the sovereignty; and two daughters, &lt;a href=\"Artemisia%20II%20of%20Caria\"&gt;Artemisia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ada%20of%20Caria\"&gt;Ada&lt;/a&gt;, who were married to their brothers Mausolus and Idrieus.\nMausolus moved his capital from &lt;a href=\"Mylasa\"&gt;Mylasa&lt;/a&gt; to Halicarnassus. His workmen deepened the city's harbor and used the dragged sand to make protecting &lt;a href=\"Breakwater%20%28structure%29\"&gt;breakwaters&lt;/a&gt; in front of the channel. On land they paved streets and &lt;a href=\"Town%20square\"&gt;squares&lt;/a&gt;, and built houses for ordinary citizens. And on one side of the harbor they built a massive fortified palace for Mausolus, positioned to have clear views out to sea and inland to the hills\u2014places from where enemies could attack. On land, the workmen also built walls and &lt;a href=\"watchtower\"&gt;watchtower&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"Architecture%20of%20ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;\u2013style theatre and a &lt;a href=\"Greek%20temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ares\"&gt;Ares&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20mythology\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"God%20%28male%20deity%29\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; of war.\nArtemisia and Mausolus spent huge amounts of tax money to embellish the city. Mausolus and Artemisia had ruled over Halicarnassus and the region surrounding it for 24 years. They commissioned statues, temples and buildings of gleaming &lt;a href=\"marble\"&gt;marble&lt;/a&gt;. When he died in 353\u00a0BC, his wife, sister and successor, &lt;a href=\"Artemisia%20II%20of%20Caria\"&gt;Artemisia II of Caria&lt;/a&gt;, began construction of a magnificent tomb for him and herself on a hill overlooking the city. She died in 351 BC (of grief, according to Cicero, \"Tusculan Disputations\" 3.31). According to &lt;a href=\"Pliny%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Pliny the Elder&lt;/a&gt; the craftsmen continued to work on the tomb after the death of their patron, \"considering that it was at once a memorial of his own fame and of the sculptor's art,\" finishing it in 350\u00a0BC. This tomb of Mausolus came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Mausoleum%20of%20Halicarnassus\"&gt;Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"seven%20wonders%20of%20the%20ancient%20world\"&gt;seven wonders of the ancient world&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtemisia was succeeded by her brother Idrieus, who, in turn, was succeeded by his wife and sister Ada when he died in 344\u00a0BC. However, Ada was usurped by her brother Pixodarus in 340\u00a0BC. On the death of Pixodarus in 335\u00a0BC his son-in-law, a Persian named &lt;a href=\"Orontobates\"&gt;Orontobates&lt;/a&gt;, received the satrapy of Caria from &lt;a href=\"Darius%20III%20of%20Persia\"&gt;Darius III of Persia&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlexander the Great and Ada of Caria.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20the%20Great\"&gt;Alexander the Great&lt;/a&gt; entered Caria in 334\u00a0BC, &lt;a href=\"Ada%20of%20Caria\"&gt;Ada&lt;/a&gt;, who was in possession of the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Alinda\"&gt;Alinda&lt;/a&gt;, surrendered the fortress to him. After taking Halicarnassus, Alexander handed back the government of Caria to her; she, in turn, formally adopted Alexander as her son, ensuring that the rule of Caria passed unconditionally to him upon her eventual death. During the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Halicarnassus\"&gt;siege of Halicarnassus&lt;/a&gt; the city was fired by the retreating Persians. As he was not able to reduce the citadel, Alexander was forced to leave it blockaded. The ruins of this citadel and moat are now a tourist attraction in Bodrum.\nLater history.\nNot long afterwards the citizens received the present of a gymnasium from &lt;a href=\"Ptolemy%20I%20Soter\"&gt;Ptolemy&lt;/a&gt; and built in his honour a \"stoa\" or portico. Under Egyptian hegemony, around 268 BC, a citizen named &lt;a href=\"Hermias%20of%20Halicarnassus\"&gt;Hermias&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"Nesiarch\"&gt;Nesiarch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nesiotic%20League\"&gt;Nesiotic League&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cyclades\"&gt;Cyclades&lt;/a&gt;.\nHalicarnassus never recovered altogether from the disasters of the siege, and &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt; describes it as almost deserted.\nBaroque artist &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Elias%20Ridinger\"&gt;Johann Elias Ridinger&lt;/a&gt; depicted the several stages of siege and taking of the place in a huge copper engraving as one of only two known today from his Alexander set.\nThe Christian and later history of the site is continued at &lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchaeological notes and restorations.\nThe site is now occupied in part by the town of Bodrum; but the ancient walls can still be traced round nearly all their circuit, and the position of several of the temples, the &lt;a href=\"Theatre%20at%20Halicarnassus\"&gt;Theatre of Halicarnassus&lt;/a&gt;, and other public buildings can be fixed with certainty.\nThe ruins of the mausoleum were recovered sufficiently by the 1857 excavations of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Thomas%20Newton\"&gt;Charles Newton&lt;/a&gt; to enable a fairly complete restoration of its design to be made. The building consisted of five parts\u2014a basement or podium, a pteron or enclosure of columns, a pyramid, a pedestal and a chariot group. The basement, covering an area of 114 feet by 92, was built of blocks of greenstone, cased with marble and covered in carvings of cows. Round the base of it were probably disposed groups of statuary. The pteron consisted (according to &lt;a href=\"Pliny%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Pliny&lt;/a&gt;) of thirty-six columns of the &lt;a href=\"Ionic%20order\"&gt;Ionic order&lt;/a&gt;, enclosing a square cella. Between the columns probably stood single statues. From the portions that have been recovered, it appears that the principal frieze of the pteron represented combats of Greeks and &lt;a href=\"Amazons\"&gt;Amazons&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, there are also many life-size fragments of animals, horsemen, etc., belonging probably to pedimental sculptures, but formerly supposed to be parts of minor friezes. Above the pteron rose the pyramid, mounting by 24 steps to an apex or pedestal.\nOn this apex stood the chariot with the figure of Mausolus himself and an attendant. The height of the statue of Mausolus in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Museum\"&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt; is 9'9\" without the plinth. The hair falls from the forehead in thick waves on each side of the face and descends nearly to the shoulder; the beard is short and close, the face square and massive, the eyes deep set under overhanging brows.

All sorts of restorations of this famous monument have been proposed. The original one, made by Newton and Pullan, is in error in many respects; and that of Oldfield, though to be preferred for its lightness (the mausoleum was said anciently to be \"suspended in mid-air\"). Another by veteran German architect, F. Adler was published in 1900; but studies have since been made (see below)."
