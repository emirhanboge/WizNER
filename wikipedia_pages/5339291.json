The stadium holds 11,700 people. It is also known as Stadion ve \u0160truncov\u00fdch sadech (Stadium in \u0160trunc Park), named after Emil \u0160trunc, a former regional chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Sokol\"&gt;Sokol&lt;/a&gt; Movement (some people incorrectly think it is named after a famous local footballer &lt;a href=\"Stanislav%20%C5%A0trunc\"&gt;Stanislav \u0160trunc&lt;/a&gt;).\nHistory.\nThe stadium was opened in 1955 for the regional &lt;a href=\"Spartakiad%20%28Czechoslovakia%29\"&gt;Spartakiad&lt;/a&gt;. After various construction enlargements, its capacity was 35,000 people, 7,600 of which were seated.

While the reconstruction was in progress, the capacity of the stadium was reduced to 3,500 spectators. At the end of August 2011, part of the 2011 reconstruction had finished, leaving the stadium with a new capacity of around 8,500. In December 2011, the reconstruction was finished with a resultant capacity of almost 12,000.\nIn 2011, Plze\u0148 played in the &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage\"&gt;2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League group stage&lt;/a&gt;. However, home matches were played at &lt;a href=\"Synot%20Tip%20Arena\"&gt;Synot Tip Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; due to the reconstruction. In January 2012, the stadium was approved for use in Plze\u0148's &lt;a href=\"2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt; match with &lt;a href=\"Schalke%2004\"&gt;Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt;.\nInternational matches.\nDoosan Arena has hosted one friendly and seven competitive matches of the &lt;a href=\"Czech%20Republic%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Czech Republic national football team&lt;/a&gt;"
