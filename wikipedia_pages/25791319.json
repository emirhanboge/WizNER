    "title": "Financial data vendor",
    "text": "A financial data vendor provides &lt;a href=\"market%20data\"&gt;market data&lt;/a&gt; to financial firms, traders, and investors. The data distributed is collected from sources such as &lt;a href=\"stock%20exchange\"&gt;stock exchange&lt;/a&gt; feeds, &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt;s and dealer desks or regulatory filings (e.g. an &lt;a href=\"SEC%20filing\"&gt;SEC filing&lt;/a&gt;).\nHistory.\nFinancial data vendors have been in existence as long as financial data has been available. The first technology that allowed data vendors to disseminate was the &lt;a href=\"ticker%20tape\"&gt;ticker tape&lt;/a&gt; starting in the 1870s. Financial data includes \"pre-trade\" such as bid/ask data necessary to price a &lt;a href=\"financial%20instrument\"&gt;financial instrument&lt;/a&gt; and post-trade data such as the last trade price and other &lt;a href=\"transaction%20data\"&gt;transaction data&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom ticker tape to television cameras, from databases to websites this multibillion-dollar industry provides data to &lt;a href=\"trading%20room\"&gt;trading room&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"consumer\"&gt;consumer&lt;/a&gt;s. Paper ticker tape became obsolete in the 1960s, as television and computers were increasingly used to transmit financial information. The concept of the stock ticker lives on, however, in the &lt;a href=\"news%20ticker\"&gt;scrolling electronic tickers&lt;/a&gt; seen on brokerage walls and on news and financial television channels.\nBecause the financial investment needed to provide the services needed, the industry had become ever more consolidated, but in 2004 it was forecast that the industry was beginning to fragment.\nIndustry size.\nAccording to the 2009 Burton-Taylor report, the Market Data industry exited 2009 at US$22.68 billion after closing 2008 at US$23.01 billion. In 2009, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg market share were virtually even, at 29.4% and 29.2% respectively.\nThe largest four financial data vendors represent the USD 15.222 billion tip of an enormous global market (2008 Annual figures) and employ tens of thousands of people.\nTypes of market data vendors.\nFive types of market data providers vend data from public markets:\n1. Exchanges\n2. Hosting providers\n3. Ticker plant providers\n4. Feed providers\n5. Software providers\nBusiness requirements to evaluate financial data vendors.\n1. Customization: How much operational control a firm has over its market data infrastructure. \n2. Latency sensitivity: The measure of how important high-speed market data is to a trading strategy.\n3. Market depth: The volume of quotes in a market data feed.\nTypes of data.\nThere are many different types of instruments (including stocks, bonds, funds, options, futures, currencies, etc.) and hundreds of different &lt;a href=\"Stock%20market\"&gt;markets&lt;/a&gt; for investment, leading to an extremely large and hard to define universe of data.\nThe types of data offered vary by vendor, and most typically cover information about entities (companies) and instruments (&lt;a href=\"shares\"&gt;shares&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt; etc.) which companies might issue. Typically, pricing data is sold separately from other related data, such as &lt;a href=\"Corporate%20action\"&gt;corporate actions and events&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valuation%20%28finance%29\"&gt;valuation information&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fundamental%20analysis\"&gt;fundamental data&lt;/a&gt; including company performance and &lt;a href=\"reference%20data\"&gt;reference data&lt;/a&gt; on the entities and instruments themselves.\nIn addition to &lt;a href=\"Market%20data\"&gt;market price data&lt;/a&gt; there are data known as &lt;a href=\"Reference%20data%20%28financial%20markets%29\"&gt;market reference data&lt;/a&gt;, such as a ticker name, which describe securities, commodities and transactions.\nIntraday Data are prices provided during the day, they are usually released every 15 minutes.\nThe majority of &lt;a href=\"financial%20data%20vendors\"&gt;financial data vendors&lt;/a&gt; can access data during trading sessions but with the requirement that any inquiry be in reference to historical market analysis. Analysis of historical market data provides a larger snapshot of the market at the expense of timely information (time inbetween database updates).\n&lt;a href=\"Alternative%20data%20%28finance%29\"&gt;Alternative data (finance)&lt;/a&gt; vendors offer non-traditional datasets, typically defined as those that do not originate from securities exchanges, regulatory disclosures, or economic release indicators. These are used by quantitative and fundamental investors to enhance portfolio returns. Examples include consumer transaction data, satellite imagery, vehicle movements, and web data, including social media data. With an estimated three out of four financial institutions housing alt-data teams as of 2020, and 90% of firms expanding their alt-data strategy, alternative data is now arguably mainstream.\nServices offered.\nMost of the market differentiation between competitors is based on some combination of the following:\nGlobal nature.\nMany vendors began as local companies, serving their own local markets. However, through merger and acquisition and in response to the increasing &lt;a href=\"globalisation\"&gt;globalisation&lt;/a&gt; of world markets, many vendors now describe themselves as global.\nReferences.\n15.
