    "text": "Minden () is a town of about 81 thousands inhabitants in the north-east of &lt;a href=\"North%20Rhine-Westphalia\"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The town extends along both sides of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Weser\"&gt;River Weser&lt;/a&gt;. It is the capital of the district (\"Kreis\") of &lt;a href=\"Minden-L%C3%BCbbecke\"&gt;Minden-L\u00fcbbecke&lt;/a&gt;, which is part of the &lt;a href=\"Detmold%20%28region%29\"&gt;region of Detmold&lt;/a&gt;. Minden is the historic political centre of the cultural region of &lt;a href=\"Minden%20Land\"&gt;Minden Land&lt;/a&gt;. It is widely known as the intersection of the &lt;a href=\"Mittelland%20Canal\"&gt;Mittelland Canal&lt;/a&gt; and the River Weser. The town is over 1,200 years old and retains some buildings in the &lt;a href=\"Weser%20Renaissance\"&gt;Weser Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; style, in addition to its architecturally symbolic 1,000-year-old cathedral.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nMinden is a town in the northeastern part of the state of &lt;a href=\"North%20Rhine-Westphalia\"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;. It lies on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Weser\"&gt;River Weser&lt;/a&gt;, north of the &lt;a href=\"Porta%20Westfalica%20%28gorge%29\"&gt;Porta Westfalica gap&lt;/a&gt; between the ridges of the &lt;a href=\"Weser%20Hills\"&gt;Weser Hills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wiehen%20Hills\"&gt;Wiehen Hills&lt;/a&gt;. The Weser leaves the &lt;a href=\"Weser%20Uplands\"&gt;Weser Uplands&lt;/a&gt; and flows into the &lt;a href=\"North%20German%20Plain\"&gt;North German Plain&lt;/a&gt;. The town centre lies to the north, on a plateau on the western side of the river. The small Bastau stream flows into the Weser from the west near the town centre. The edge of the plateau marks the transition from the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Weser%20Valley\"&gt;Middle Weser Valley&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BCbbecke%20Loessland\"&gt;L\u00fcbbecke Loessland&lt;/a&gt;. This marked change in terrain divides the upper town from the lower town, and marks the boundary between two ecological zones.\nIn the frame of &lt;a href=\"Natural%20regions%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Natural regions of Germany&lt;/a&gt; the western part of Minden belongs to a sequence of geomorphological units (from south to north): the Wiehen Hills, the L\u00fcbbecke Loessland, therein the Bastau depression, and the &lt;a href=\"D%C3%BCmmer%20Geest%20Lowland\"&gt;D\u00fcmmer Geest Lowland&lt;/a&gt;. The eastern part lies in the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Weser%20Valley\"&gt;Middle Weser Valley&lt;/a&gt; depression.\nCrossing the Weser valley was once favoured by a &lt;a href=\"ford%20%28crossing%29\"&gt;ford&lt;/a&gt; with a small hill in the middle; there the Weser &lt;a href=\"meander\"&gt;meander&lt;/a&gt; touches the western edge of the valley, the eastern &lt;a href=\"floodplain\"&gt;floodplain&lt;/a&gt; is usually meadowland, but inundated in times of flood, so that the central &lt;a href=\"bridgehead\"&gt;bridgehead&lt;/a&gt; (\"Br\u00fcckenkopf\") becomes a &lt;a href=\"river%20island\"&gt;river island&lt;/a&gt;. Today a system of two bridges crosses the valley.\nThe Mittelland Canal connecting the river systems of &lt;a href=\"Ems%20%28river%29\"&gt;Ems&lt;/a&gt;, Weser and &lt;a href=\"Elbe\"&gt;Elbe&lt;/a&gt; traverses the town from east to west, while the Weser flows from south to north. These waterways cross in the northern area of the town at the &lt;a href=\"Minden%20Aqueduct\"&gt;Minden Aqueduct&lt;/a&gt; (\"Wasserstra\u00dfenkreuz Minden\").\nThe Weser leaves the Minden area at its lowest part in the quarter of Leteln, at , while the highest part is the top of \"H\u00e4verst\u00e4dter Berg\" with , at the edge of the Wiehen Hills in the quarter of Haddenhausen. The altitude of the town is given officially as , based on the elevation of the town hall.\nThe town covers an area of . It extends from north to south and from east to west.\nMinden is NE of &lt;a href=\"Bielefeld\"&gt;Bielefeld&lt;/a&gt;, W of &lt;a href=\"Hanover\"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt;, S of &lt;a href=\"Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt; and E of &lt;a href=\"Osnabr%C3%BCck\"&gt;Osnabr\u00fcck&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeighbouring settlements.\nClockwise from north\nTown subdivision.\nMinden consists of 19 quarters:\nGeology, mineral deposits and their use.\nThe Wiehen Hills &lt;a href=\"escarpment\"&gt;escarpment&lt;/a&gt; extends more than 100 kilometers from west of Osnabr\u00fcck to the Porta Westfalica gap and is continued in the Weser Hills range. The escarpment forming horizons incline gently flattening to the north; they are of &lt;a href=\"jurassic\"&gt;jurassic&lt;/a&gt; age, overlayed by &lt;a href=\"cretaceous\"&gt;cretaceous&lt;/a&gt; sediments that form the hill of B\u00f6lhorst, and &lt;a href=\"tertiary\"&gt;tertiary&lt;/a&gt; layers further to the north. The underground basis is of palaeozoic material from &lt;a href=\"Devonian\"&gt;Devonian&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Permian\"&gt;Permian&lt;/a&gt;. A new described &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wiehenvenator\"&gt;Wiehenvenator&lt;/a&gt;, was found in the Wiehen Hills near Haddenhausen, popularly referred to as the \"Monster of Minden\".\nThe Porta sandstone (Portasandstein) of the Wiehen Hills has been used as building Material for centuries and is yet to be seen at a lot of public and private buildings in Minden and the whole Region. Another valuable material is &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt;, that has been mined until to the first half of the 20th century. Mining relicts are remaining; e.g. the \"Potts Park\", an amusement park in D\u00fctzen, is located at the place of a former ore mine.\nThe B\u00f6lhorst hill two kilometers north of the Wiehen Hills is formed by horizons of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Cretaceous\"&gt;lower cretaceous&lt;/a&gt; age and, in geological sense, is the western extension of the eastward &lt;a href=\"B%C3%BCckeberg\"&gt;B\u00fcckeberg&lt;/a&gt; in the Schaumburg district. In both elevations the hard coal containing &lt;a href=\"Berriasian\"&gt;Berriasian&lt;/a&gt; layers reach near to the surface. By reason of the correspondence of the &lt;a href=\"B%C3%BCckeberg%20Formation\"&gt;B\u00fcckeberg Formation&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Wealden%20Group\"&gt;Wealden Group&lt;/a&gt;, the type of coal found here was named \"Wealdenkohle\" in German language. Mining in the &lt;a href=\"Minden%20Coalfield\"&gt;Minden Coalfield&lt;/a&gt; started in the 17th century during the Swedish occupation and ended in late 19th century. Another coal mine in the eastern quarter of Mei\u00dfen worked from 1878 to 1958.\nA source of 10-percentage brine with origin in the deep &lt;a href=\"Zechstein\"&gt;Zechstein&lt;/a&gt; series was pumped in the B\u00f6lhorst mine and once used for &lt;a href=\"balneotherapy\"&gt;balneotherapy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe last relief forming age was the &lt;a href=\"pleistocene\"&gt;pleistocene&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Saalian%20glaciation\"&gt;Saalian glaciation&lt;/a&gt; the whole region was ice-covered, now verified by lots of &lt;a href=\"glacial%20erratic\"&gt;glacial erratic&lt;/a&gt; rocks from Scandinavia placed for decoration in the town area. The Bastau depression, a late-Saalian Weser bed, became a marshy peat-covered area; the &lt;a href=\"peat\"&gt;peat&lt;/a&gt; is completely exhausted for its use as firing material. In the time of &lt;a href=\"Weichselian%20glaciation\"&gt;Weichselian glaciation&lt;/a&gt; the glacier did not reach this region. In the &lt;a href=\"periglacial\"&gt;periglacial&lt;/a&gt; climate of that time fine material (&lt;a href=\"silt\"&gt;silt&lt;/a&gt;) was blown and accumulated north of the Wiehen Hills as well as north of the Bastau depression in either small west\u2013east stripes of loess.\nIn the Weser depression Weichselian &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; deposits are found and used in gravel pits.\nLand use.\nThe forestal use of the considerably inclined Wiehen Hills shows a striking contrast to the nearly woodless &lt;a href=\"loess\"&gt;loess&lt;/a&gt; stripes of the northern foothills as well as north of the Bastau depression. The loess developed to most fertile soils (&lt;a href=\"luvisol\"&gt;luvisol&lt;/a&gt;s) and is used as arable land since prehistoric times. Both of the stripes are also important running lines of traffic, today the federal road 65 form Minden to &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BCbbecke\"&gt;L\u00fcbbecke&lt;/a&gt; and the road from Minden to &lt;a href=\"Espelkamp\"&gt;Espelkamp&lt;/a&gt;. The villages thus connected have developed to settlements of considerable size.\nIn clear contrast, the Bastau depression is free of settlement and forests and is only in agricultural use. Only one north to south directed road passes through this area in the southwest of the town area. The &lt;a href=\"gleysol\"&gt;gleysol&lt;/a&gt;s of this area as well as in the Weser valley depression are in agricultural use after drainage.\nCompared to other towns of the same type in North Rhine-Westphalia the percentage of woodland is remarkably small.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nEvidence of settlements in various parts of the town suggests that the site of Minden has been settled since the 3rd century A.D. The Minden area shows continuing settlement activity from the 1st to the 4th century, when it belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Rhine-Weser%20Germanic\"&gt;Rhine-Weser Germanic&lt;/a&gt; development sphere.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20campaigns%20in%20Germania%20%2812%20BC%20%E2%80%93%20AD%2016%29\"&gt;Roman campaigns in Germania (12 BC \u2013 AD 16)&lt;/a&gt; this part of Westphalia came in the focus of military activities. It has been a matter of discussion, whether the Minden region could have been the location of a military camp where commander &lt;a href=\"Publius%20Quinctilius%20Varus\"&gt;Publius Quinctilius Varus&lt;/a&gt; started from marching to the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Teutoburg%20Forest\"&gt;Battle of the Teutoburg Forest&lt;/a&gt; in 9 AD. Likewise the localization of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Idistaviso\"&gt;Battle of Idistaviso&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Angrivarian%20Wall\"&gt;Battle of the Angrivarian Wall&lt;/a&gt; as well, both took place in 16 AD, to the eastern part of Minden or its neighbour town &lt;a href=\"Porta%20Westfalica\"&gt;Porta Westfalica&lt;/a&gt; is doubtful. Definite archaeological proofs for these locations have yet been missing. In 2008, relicts of a temporary military camp have been found in Barkhausen, about 3.5\u00a0km south from the centre of Minden.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe name \"Minda\" is firstly mentioned in a &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Frankish%20Annals\"&gt;Royal Frankish Annals&lt;/a&gt; record referring to an assembly held by &lt;a href=\"Charlemagne\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/a&gt; in 798. The location of the so-named settlement is supposed at the left river side, where today's \"Fischerstadt\" exists. About 800 AD a bishopric was founded and the first cathedral was built nearby to the older village. After the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Duchy of Saxony&lt;/a&gt; in 1180 the bishopric was upgraded to the &lt;a href=\"Prince-Bishopric%20of%20Minden\"&gt;Prince-Bishopric of Minden&lt;/a&gt; as a constitutional territory of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and remained in this status until 1648. During the &lt;a href=\"Investiture%20Controversy\"&gt;Investiture Controversy&lt;/a&gt; two bishops were nominated at the same time in 1080 both by the papal supporters and those of King &lt;a href=\"Henry%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Henry IV&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Domfreiheit\"&gt;Cathedral close&lt;/a&gt; on the lower Weser terrace was soon surrounded to the north and west by a settlement of artisans and merchants, who lived in a parish of their own, St John's. The development of the upper town began with the activities of ecclesial convents. A convent of &lt;a href=\"Benedictines\"&gt;Benedictine&lt;/a&gt; nuns removed from the Wiehen Hills to the northwestern edge of the town c. 1000 AD. In 1029 the Canonical Convent of St Martin appears, and a 1042 founded Benedictine monastery removed in 1434 from the Weser shore to a new upper site, where the monastery of St Maurice was founded. The &lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Order\"&gt;Dominicane&lt;/a&gt; convent St Paul was established in 1236.\nGerman medieval sovereigns governed their realms with an &lt;a href=\"itinerant%20court\"&gt;itinerant court&lt;/a&gt;, travelling from town to town. &lt;a href=\"Louis%20the%20German\"&gt;Louis the German&lt;/a&gt; hold an imperial assembly in Minden in 852. The Emperors of the &lt;a href=\"Ottonian%20dynasty\"&gt;Ottonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salian%20dynasty\"&gt;Salian dynasty&lt;/a&gt; visited Minden several times. When Henry IV came to visit in 1062 a dispute between members of his entourage and citizens caused a fire that destroyed the cathedral and parts of the town. The visit of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles IV&lt;/a&gt; in October 1377 was the last one until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.\nIn 1168 &lt;a href=\"Henry%20the%20Lion\"&gt;Henry the Lion&lt;/a&gt;, Duke of Saxony, married his second wife &lt;a href=\"Matilda%20of%20England%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Matilda&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Henry%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;Henry II of England&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Minden%20Cathedral\"&gt;Minden Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;; with this marriage Henry maintained the continuance of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Welf\"&gt;House of Welf&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rights to hold a market, to mint coins, and to collect customs duties were granted in 977 by Emperor &lt;a href=\"Otto%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Otto II&lt;/a&gt;. Until the beginning of the 13th century, the bishop appointed the leader and administrator of the town, with the title of \"Wichgraf\". The citizens of Minden and their Council obtained independence from the bishop's rule around 1230 and received a town charter. They utilised these new rights to begin trading independently from the church.\nThe economic development of Minden was influenced by its location on a navigable river and by its success in grain trading since the Middle Ages. Minden got the right to store goods and could force passing ships to unload their cargo; furtheron the town was member of the &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20League\"&gt;Hanseatic League&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe increased self-confidence of the citizens of Minden was demonstrated by the construction of the town hall, probably adjoining the separately governed cathedral precinct. As a result, Bishop Gottfried von Waldeck moved his official residence from Minden to &lt;a href=\"Petershagen\"&gt;Petershagen&lt;/a&gt; in 1306\u20131307.\nThe year of construction of the first Weser bridge is not known. A previous wooden pedestrian bridge was replaced in the late 13th century by another one fit for wagon transport. In the early 16th century Minden got a stone &lt;a href=\"arch%20bridge\"&gt;arch bridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern Era since Reformation.\nThe introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutheranian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reformation\"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt; in 1529 caused much conflict in the town, leading to the formation of a 36-man unit that took over the role of town regiment. Reformator Nicholas Krage announced Minden's new church order based on &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Luther\"&gt;Martin Luther&lt;/a&gt;'s principles from the pulpit of St Martin's Church (\"Martinikirche\") on 13 February 1530. The Dominicane convent was dissolved in 1529, and its buildings were afterward used as location of the 1530 founded &lt;a href=\"Gymnasium%20%28Germany%29\"&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest Protestant one in Westphalia.\nEven after the reformation Minden was a stronghold of &lt;a href=\"witch-hunt\"&gt;witch-hunt&lt;/a&gt; in Germany. There were 128 prosecutions for witchcraft between 1603 and 1684. As in nearby regions, almost all those sentenced were women.\nImperial troops occupied Minden from 1625 to 1634 during the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt; (1618\u20131648). Protestant Swedish troops laid siege to Minden and captured it in 1634. Queen &lt;a href=\"Christina%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Christina of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; granted Minden full sovereignty in internal and external affairs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Peace%20of%20Westphalia\"&gt;Peace of Westphalia&lt;/a&gt; in 1648 secularized the Prince-Bishopric to the Principality of Minden which was adjointed to the &lt;a href=\"Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg\"&gt;Prince Electorate of Brandenburg&lt;/a&gt;, lateron named &lt;a href=\"Brandenburg-Prussia\"&gt;Brandenburg-Prussia&lt;/a&gt;. The Swedish troops moved back in 1650, and the principality administration was led back from Petershagen to Minden in 1668. For the time being, the \"Great Elector\" &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20William%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg\"&gt;Frederick William&lt;/a&gt; confirmed all traditional rights of the town, but under his successors King &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20I%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Frederick I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20William%20I%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Frederick William I&lt;/a&gt; the town was subordinated to the strongly centralized government in the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Absolutism%20%28European%20history%29\"&gt;absolutism&lt;/a&gt;. The 400-year civil self-determination ended with two town regulations from 1711 and 1721; the representatives of the town were no longer elected for a certain period, but for lifetime, and they needed royal confirmation for inauguration.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Minden\"&gt;Battle of Minden&lt;/a&gt; took place some miles to the north of Minden on 1 August 1759 during the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Seven Years' War&lt;/a&gt;. The allied forces of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hanover\"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Landgraviate%20of%20Hesse-Kassel\"&gt;Hesse-Kassel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brunswick-Wolfenbuettel\"&gt;Brunswick-Wolfenbuettel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Schaumburg-Lippe\"&gt;Schaumburg-Lippe&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Ferdinand%20of%20Brunswick\"&gt;Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick&lt;/a&gt;, defeated the French and the allied &lt;a href=\"Electorate%20of%20Saxony\"&gt;Electorate of Saxony&lt;/a&gt;, led by the Marquis &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Georges%20%C3%89rasme%20de%20Contades\"&gt;de Contades&lt;/a&gt;, in a decisive battle. The region remained Prussian and the adjacent &lt;a href=\"Electorate%20of%20Hanover\"&gt;Prince Electorate of Hanover&lt;/a&gt; remained in the possession of the British king being the &lt;a href=\"Prince-elector%20of%20Hanover\"&gt;Prince-elector of Hanover&lt;/a&gt; in personal union.\nBecause the town had been occupied twice by French troops during the war, King &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20the%20Great\"&gt;Frederick the Great&lt;/a&gt; realized that the town could no more been defended in the old manner. Thus he gave order to annulate Minden's status as a fortress in 1764.\nThe town was capital of the Prussian Territory of &lt;a href=\"Minden-Ravensberg\"&gt;Minden-Ravensberg&lt;/a&gt; from 1719 to 1807 and was seat of the upper administrative authority named \"Kriegs- und Dom\u00e4nenkammer\" (Chamber of War Affairs and State Property), that ruled Minden-Ravensberg together wird the County of Lingen and the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Tecklenburg\"&gt;County of Tecklenburg&lt;/a&gt;, being prussian territories, too. The most prominent president of the chamber was the \n&lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Friedrich%20Karl%20vom%20und%20zum%20Stein\"&gt;Baron vom Stein&lt;/a&gt; from 1796 to 1803.\nThe Weser had always been an important trade route, and the legal regulations of trading were of immense significance. In 1552 Emperor &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt; conferred the privilege of its merchants' unhindered trading on the whole Weser to the town of Minden. During the Thirty Years' War Emperor &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Ferdinand II&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the &lt;a href=\"staple%20right\"&gt;staple right&lt;/a&gt; to Minden in 1627, what means that all passing merchants were enforced to offer their goods for sale for some days. As other Weser bording towns like &lt;a href=\"Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hann.%20M%C3%BCnden\"&gt;M\u00fcnden&lt;/a&gt; owned similar rights, many conflicts arose about the partly contradictory legal positions.\nFrom the Napoleonic Wars to World War I.\nIn course of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Fourth%20Coalition\"&gt;War of the Fourth Coalition&lt;/a&gt; French troops occupied the town on 13 November 1806. In the following year &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt; founded the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Westphalia\"&gt;Kingdom of Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;, governed by his brother &lt;a href=\"Jerome%20Bonaparte\"&gt;Jerome Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt; as the king; Minden became part of this &lt;a href=\"client%20state\"&gt;client state&lt;/a&gt; until 1810 as district capital in the Weser department. Since 1 January 1811 Napoleon put Minden to the department &lt;a href=\"Ems-Sup%C3%A9rieur\"&gt;Ems-Sup\u00e9rieur&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Empire\"&gt;French Empire&lt;/a&gt;; now the Weser formed the eastern frontier between France and Westphalia. Until 1806 the area close to the cathedral was governed by clerical rulers of the catholic church as territory of its own right in contrast to the other quarters of the Protestant town. In the French time the rights of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20chapter\"&gt;Cathedral chapter&lt;/a&gt; were abolished, the still existing convents were dissolved, and some ecclesial buildings like St John's church were secularized and used for military purpose.\nBefore the French troops abandoned Minden on 3 November 1813 after the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Leipzig\"&gt;Battle of Leipzig&lt;/a&gt;, they blew up some arches of the Weser bridge; the defect was repaired with a wooden auxiliary construction for the following decades.\nMinden became again part of the Kingdom of Prussia, but by royal order it was declared fortress once more. The fortress regulations ordered a 600-meters area in front of the wall being free of any buildings, not even vertical gravestones were allowed. The refortification had severe consequences, it hindered any extension of the town area and thus the economic development. The \"Infanterie-Regiment \u201ePrinz Friedrich der Niederlande\u201c (2. Westf\u00e4lisches) Nr. 15\" was stationed in the garrison from 1820 to 1919, when it was dissolved; the naming &lt;a href=\"Colonel-in-chief\"&gt;Colonel-in-chief&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Frederick%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Prince Frederick of the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and after his death &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Emma%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Queen Emma of the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20Vienna\"&gt;Congress of Vienna&lt;/a&gt; had passed general principles of free traffic on the main rivers in 1815, the Weser Shipping Act (\"Weserschifffahrtsakte\") was brought in force in 1823 that annulated all restrictions and financial burdens for shipping on the river.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cologne-Minden%20trunk%20line\"&gt;trunk line&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cologne-Minden%20Railway%20Company\"&gt;Cologne-Minden Railway Company&lt;/a&gt; was opened in 1847 with a solidly fortified station and connected with the &lt;a href=\"Hanover%E2%80%93Minden%20railway\"&gt;Hanover\u2013Minden railway&lt;/a&gt;. After the defortification the railway was an important momentum for economic growth in Minden.\nThe town remained a Prussian fortress until 1873, when Germany's &lt;a href=\"Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29\"&gt;Imperial Diet&lt;/a&gt; (\"Reichstag\") passed the law to remove the fortress status of several fortified places, among them Minden. The fortress walls were razed until 1880 \u2013 the town had to pay for it \u2013, and a new Weser bridge was constructed, permitting the town to catch up economically. However, it was never able to regain its former political and economic importance.\nThe upper class used the new conditions for construction of a new town quarter in a half-circle to the north and west of the old centre with prestigious buildings on spacious plots, but the urgent narrowness inside the centre remained. A lot of buildings in the style of historicism replaced older ones at the market place and in the main streets.\nThe lack of buildings outside the fortifications was favourable for planning a road network in the outer areas of the town. Since the 1890s a sequence of six ring roads in the west and north of the town has formed the backbone of the road network.\nGrandiose festivities took place, when Emperor &lt;a href=\"William%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor\"&gt;William II&lt;/a&gt; and Empress &lt;a href=\"Augusta%20Victoria%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein\"&gt;Auguste Victoria&lt;/a&gt; visited Minden and the southern village of Barkhausen for inauguration of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20William%20Monument%20%28Porta%20Westfalica%29\"&gt;Emperor William Monument&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Wittekindsberg\"&gt;Wittekindsberg&lt;/a&gt; above the Porta Westphalica gap on 18 October 1896; since then the monument is a remarkable element of the southern horizont view from Minden.\nThe Weimar Republic and the Nazi Regime.\nThe monarchy abolishing &lt;a href=\"German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%9319\"&gt;November Revolution&lt;/a&gt; of 1918 passed with only small disturbances occurred in a few barracks of the Minden Garrison on 7 and 8 November 1918. These were calmed down by representatives of the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Social Democratic Party of Germany&lt;/a&gt; (SPD) and by union representatives. A &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20Council\"&gt;Workers\u2019 and Soldiers\u2019 Council&lt;/a&gt; took control in the afternoon of 18 November.\nThe situation in Minden got more critical during the &lt;a href=\"Kapp%20Putsch\"&gt;Kapp Putsch&lt;/a&gt; of March 1920, when right-wing officers tried to overthrow the legal government of the \"&lt;a href=\"Weimar%20Republic\"&gt;German Reich&lt;/a&gt;\". The majority of the Minden Town Council declared their loyalty to President &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Ebert\"&gt;Friedrich Ebert&lt;/a&gt; and Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Bauer\"&gt;Bauer&lt;/a&gt;, who for their part confirmed the authority of the Minden Workers' Council. The assassination of Foreign Minister &lt;a href=\"Walther%20Rathenau\"&gt;Walther Rathenau&lt;/a&gt; on 24 June 1922 resulted in serious rioting in Minden. A demonstration of 15,000 people in support of the government was held at the market square on 27 June.\nIn 1929 the &lt;a href=\"Melitta\"&gt;Melitta&lt;/a&gt; firm transferred its production to Minden. Since 1935 the \"Chemische Werke Minden\" produced chemicals for pharmaceutical use, e.g. &lt;a href=\"codeine\"&gt;codeine&lt;/a&gt;; because of potentially military interest the producing company \"Knoll AG\" in &lt;a href=\"Ludwigshafen\"&gt;Ludwigshafen&lt;/a&gt; had decided for a more inner-German producing location.\nFrom 1934 to 1940 two suburbs with single-family houses of modest size (\"Siedlung Kuhlenkamp\" and \"Siedlung Rodenbeck\") were created in considerable distance to the previous settlements. Like in other communities, the names of some streets or places were changed by political reasons during the Nazi time, but all the thirteen cases were reversed in 1945.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, underground factories were built in the &lt;a href=\"Weser%20Hills\"&gt;Weser Hills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wiehen%20Hills\"&gt;Wiehen Hills&lt;/a&gt; near Minden. &lt;a href=\"Slave%20labour\"&gt;Slave labour&lt;/a&gt;ers from a nearby &lt;a href=\"concentration%20camp\"&gt;concentration camp&lt;/a&gt; were forced to produce weapons and other war &lt;a href=\"materiel\"&gt;materiel&lt;/a&gt;. After the war the machinery was removed by American troops and the entrances sealed.\nMost of the Jewish citizens were deported, dispossessed and murdered. The \"&lt;a href=\"Stolpersteine\"&gt;Stolpersteine&lt;/a&gt;\" (stumbling stones) have been laid on Minden's pavements as a memorial to them.\nMinden sustained severe damage from bombardment during World War II. These attacks were minor during the early phase of the war. The raid on 26 October 1944 on the canal aqueduct resulted in the breaching of the &lt;a href=\"Mittelland%20Canal\"&gt;Mittelland Canal&lt;/a&gt; and the drowning of numerous workers in a nearby air raid shelter. The last and most devastating air raid was conducted by &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces\"&gt;United States Army Air Forces&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress\"&gt;Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress&lt;/a&gt; aircraft on 28 March 1945. This almost completely destroyed great parts of the town centre, including the town hall and cathedral, and resulted in the death of over 180 people. At the end of the war 13% of all buildings were destroyed or damaged.\nThe advance of &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied&lt;/a&gt; troops toward the end of the war caused many of the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazis&lt;/a&gt; who were running the town, to flee across the Weser to the east. The town was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Canadian%20Parachute%20Battalion\"&gt;1st Canadian Airborne Battalion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Parachute%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;3rd Parachute Brigade&lt;/a&gt; on the evening of 1 April 1945. Almost all the bridges over the Weser and Mittelland Canal as well as the canal aqueduct had just been blown up by the &lt;a href=\"Wehrmacht\"&gt;German Army&lt;/a&gt; in a futile attempt to delay the Allied advance, according to Hitler's &lt;a href=\"Nero%20Decree\"&gt;Nero Decree&lt;/a&gt;.\nPostwar time.\nIn the early post-war time the Minden region became a central part of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Occupation%20Zone\"&gt;British Occupation Zone&lt;/a&gt;. The British Military Government took its main location in Bad Oeynhausen before it moved to Berlin. The headquarter of the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine\"&gt;British Forces&lt;/a&gt; remained there until 1954. All the German Wehrmacht barracks in Minden were taken by the British Army, 466 houses were confiscated in 1945. As immediate measure the British Army set up an auxiliary bridge (\"Francis bridge\"), that was in use until the restoring of the regular bridge in 1947.\nFor reactivation of German economic power the \"Wirtschaftsrat f\u00fcr die britische Besatzungszone\" (\"Economic Council for the British Occupation Zone\") was founded in Minden on 11 March 1946, that supervised the work of the \"Zentralamt f\u00fcr Wirtschaft\" (\"Central Office for Economy\") at the same place. After the partial conjunction of the American and British Occupation Zones in 1947 to the &lt;a href=\"Bizone\"&gt;Bizone&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Bizonal%20Economic%20Council\"&gt;Bizonal Economic Council&lt;/a&gt; continued the activities of the Minden \"Wirtschaftsrat\" in &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town administration resumed its work on 9 April 1945 on a provisional basis. Following to the foundation of the state of &lt;a href=\"North%20Rhine-Westphalia\"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt; in 1946 the former &lt;a href=\"Free%20State%20of%20Lippe\"&gt;Free State of Lippe&lt;/a&gt; was adjoined to it in 1947; as a result of it Minden lost its position as a &lt;a href=\"Regierungsbezirk\"&gt;regional capital&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Detmold\"&gt;Detmold&lt;/a&gt; in 1947. Different to the other &lt;a href=\"Allied%20Powers%20%28World%20War%20II%29\"&gt;Allied Powers&lt;/a&gt;, the Britains changed the German community regulation for their occupation zone in the way of strict &lt;a href=\"separation%20of%20powers\"&gt;separation of powers&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1946 the Mayor was merely an honorary position as head of town and chairman of the town council; a professional \"Stadtdirektor\" (town director) was chief of the administration. In the state of North Rhine-Westphalia these regulations were in force until 1998.\nParts of the &lt;a href=\"Bundesbahn%20Central%20Offices\"&gt;Federal Railways Central Offices&lt;/a&gt; (\"Bundesbahn-Zentral\u00e4mter\") were moved to Minden in 1950. In course of the &lt;a href=\"West%20German%20rearmament\"&gt;West German rearmament&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Herzog-von-Braunschweig-Kaserne\" (Duke of Brunswick Barracks) was built for the new Minden garrison of the Federal Forces (\"&lt;a href=\"Bundeswehr\"&gt;Bundeswehr&lt;/a&gt;\") in 1959 in the western quarter of Rodenbeck and another barracks in the quarter of Minderheide.\nIn the 1960s the unruly behaviour of some of the &lt;a href=\"Cameronians%20%28Scottish%20Rifles%29\"&gt;Cameronians&lt;/a&gt; who were stationed in Minden as part of the BAOR made front-page news on the &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Mirror\"&gt;Daily Mirror&lt;/a&gt;. A local described the smaller Scottish soldiers as \"poison dwarfs\".\nThe town centre reconstruction adapted largely to the pre-war situation, the previous road system remained, but the destroyed houses were rebuilt in the 1950s style. Even in the undestroyed areas dilapidated buildings were replaced by new ones that deviated from the quarter's character by form and volume. The renewal of the main shopping street \"Scharn\" was planned by &lt;a href=\"Werner%20March\"&gt;Werner March&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe serious lack of housing in the 1950s and 1960s, caused by bombing and the post-war migration of refugees, was sorted with new housing areas, especially in the west and north of the centre. Furthermore, some housing estates for British soldiers' families were developed.\nFrom the local government reorganization to present day.\nOn 1 January 1973, the previously separate surrounding communities of Aminghausen, B\u00f6lhorst, Dankersen, D\u00fctzen, Haddenhausen, Hahlen, H\u00e4verst\u00e4dt, Kutenhausen, Leteln, Mei\u00dfen, P\u00e4pinghausen, Stemmer, Todtenhausen as well as parts of Barkhausen, Hartum and Holzhausen II were incorporated into the town of Minden. Thereby the town area increased from 29\u00a0km to 101\u00a0km and the population number from about 54.000 to about 84.000. At the same time the former districts of Minden and L\u00fcbbecke were merged to the new district (\"Kreis\") of Minden-L\u00fcbbecke, from which Minden became the capital. A new district administration building was constructed south of the town centre on the site of an old barracks; the old administrative building is to be used as a community archive.\nIn the 1960s many remaining problems of the town centre got more and more urgent, as for example a high population density, a great percentage of low-income persons, houses in poor condition, business premises not up-to-date, endangered pedestrians, and severe shortage of parking lots. Therefore, an urban renewal was carried out in the 1970s, within the frame of the federal law f\u00fcr urban development promotion (1971) and subsidized by public money. Dilapidated buildings were renovated or replaced by new structures, but the removal of timbered houses as part of this renewal was later regretted. The height of buildings was restricted to four or five storeys. The main shopping areas were rearranged to a pedestrian zone. Public traffic was kept away from the inner part with a new central bus station nearby. Since then the individual traffic has been hindered crossing through the centre, but houses can be reached by a dead end system. Two large parking areas at the edge of the town centre, an underground car park and several multistorey car parks provide parking facilities. To keep away the regional traffic two new Weser bridges and a new bypass road in the very east were built; the old bridge was replaced in 1978.\nA new building was necessary for purpose of administrative responsibilities of the enlarged town. Architect &lt;a href=\"Harald%20Deilmann\"&gt;Harald Deilmann&lt;/a&gt; planned this impressive complex directly from the old town hall to the cathedral court in the style of &lt;a href=\"Structuralism%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;structuralism&lt;/a&gt;, but since its completion in 1977 it has been discussed quite controversially in Minden's public opinion, not only for the look of the fa\u00e7ade, but also for blocking the scenic view of the cathedral from the arches of the old town hall. In 2006 a controversial resolution by the town council proposed the demolition of the town hall extensions to make room for a new shopping mall. However, a 57% majority opposed this plan in a referendum. Today the whole town hall building complex is classified as historical monument, an extensive renovation is going on since 2019.\nThe shoreline of the Weser was improved in 1976 by extending the promenade from the \"Fischerstadt\" (Fishermen's Town). The \"Glacis\", a park-like open space in front of the old fortifications, which was important as a green belt, was altered and made more accessible. The old town wall fronting the Fischerstadt was restored to its former height. \nThe opposite shore area (\"Kanzlers Weide\") has been made accessible by a footbridge. This improves access to a large parking area and festival site.\nAfter the British troops had left Minden in 1994, their barracks areas got valuable sites for further town development.\nDemography.\nPopulation growth.\nIn the region &lt;a href=\"Ostwestfalen-Lippe\"&gt;Ostwestfalen-Lippe&lt;/a&gt; which is congruent to the &lt;a href=\"Detmold%20%28region%29\"&gt;administrative region of Detmold&lt;/a&gt;, Minden takes the fourth place by population after Bielefeld, Paderborn, and &lt;a href=\"G%C3%BCtersloh\"&gt;G\u00fctersloh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe earliest detailed information of population number is given from 1740. In times of prussian government, Minden as a regional capital and garrison showed a gentle population growth by officials and soldiers, and then, after the defortification, by industrial workers out of the surrounding region.\nAfter World War II the population increased by massive immigration of expelled persons and refugees mainly from former East Germany. Since the &lt;a href=\"1960s\"&gt;1960s&lt;/a&gt; the immigration of foreign workers from the mediterranean countries to West Germany had an effect in Minden, too; initially thought to be &lt;a href=\"guest%20workers\"&gt;guest workers&lt;/a&gt;, many of them have settled in the town permanently.\nAn immigration of &lt;a href=\"Russia%20Germans\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; and its succeeding countries to Germany began in the &lt;a href=\"1980s\"&gt;1980s&lt;/a&gt;, and the district of Minden-L\u00fcbbecke was one of their preferred regions. The &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt; in 1989\u20131990 gave East German people the opportunity to move to the west. The last current immigration period is characterized by immigrants of &lt;a href=\"Near%20East\"&gt;Near East&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Asylum%20seeker\"&gt;asylum seeking&lt;/a&gt; refugees.\nThe sudden increase of population number in 1973 results from the administrative adjointment of the surrounding villages to the Minden town area.\nReligions.\nChristians.\nProtestant.\nThe Reformation was carried out in Minden between 1521 and 1529. The town contains six Protestant parishes today: St Mary's, St Martin's, St Mark's, St James' and the parishes of St Peter's and St Simeon's Churches. They all are parts of the &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Church%20of%20Westphalia\"&gt;Evangelical Church of Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;.\nRoman Catholic.\nAccording to the regulations of the Peace of Westphalia, Minden Cathedral remained in Catholic possession. During the population growth in the 19th century the small number of Catholics rose slowly, and because of the migration of expelled persons, working migrants and refugees after World War II the percentage of Catholics increased considerably among the population of Minden.\nThere are four Roman Catholic parishes in Minden: the parish of the cathedral St Peter and Gorgonius, and parishes of St Mauritius, St Paul and St Ansgar, which are all bound together into a pastoral combination of the Mindener Land, being part of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Paderborn\"&gt;Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther Christian Communities.\nFurther Christian communities are the New Apostolics, the Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and others. Many of the Germans who have immigrated from Russia and central Asian countries belong to baptistic or mennonitic communities.\nA small Quakers community existed during the 19th century, but only their cemetery has remained.\nNon-Christian Religions.\nJewish.\nA Jewish community has existed in Minden since 1270 and grew up to 400 members in the 19th century. After World War II the Jewish community was reconstituted with 40 members. The Minden synagogue which was destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Kristallnacht\"&gt;November pogrom&lt;/a&gt; on 9 November 1938, was inaugurated at a new nearby site in 1958 and is the centre of the Jewish community.\nMuslims.\nIn the last half century a considerable Muslim community has grown in Minden with three existing mosques.\nPolitics.\nMayor.\nThe Mayor is the head of the town, the leader of town administration and chairman of the city council, where he not entitled to vote. The Mayor is elected every five years.\nThe current Mayor of Minden is Michael J\u00e4cke of the &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany\"&gt;Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (SPD) since 2015 and re-elected in 2020 with 54.3% of the votes.\nCity council.\nThe Minden city council governs the city together the Mayor. Elections to the city council are held every five years. The recent city council election took place on 13 September 2020. Apart from the nationwide parties, the members of Minden Council belong also to three local associations of independent voters.\n! colspan=2| Party\n! Votes\n! +/-\n! Seats\n! colspan=2| Total\n! 100.0\n! 56\n! 4\n! colspan=2| Electorate/voter turnout\n! 47.14\n! 1.5\n!\nElections to parliaments.\nThe constituencies for state parliament and &lt;a href=\"Minden-L%C3%BCbbecke%20I\"&gt;federal parliament&lt;/a&gt; elections Minden belonged to, have been mostly won by candidates of the Social Democratic Party.\nCoat of arms, flag, motto.\nThe coat of arms shows the doubled-headed &lt;a href=\"Reichsadler\"&gt;imperial eagle&lt;/a&gt; (\"Reichsadler\") of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dexter%20and%20sinister\"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt;, awarded in 1627 by emperor &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Ferdinand II&lt;/a&gt; for support of the town in the Thirty Years' War. The &lt;a href=\"Dexter%20and%20sinister\"&gt;left&lt;/a&gt; side shows the &lt;a href=\"Keys%20of%20Heaven\"&gt;crossed keys&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Peter\"&gt;Saint Peter&lt;/a&gt;, patron of Minden cathedral, as part of the Prince-Bishop's coat of arms.\nThe red-white flag show the colours of the Hanseatic league. The town's motto is \"Ius et aequitas civitatum vincula\" (Law and justice are the towns' ties).\nCulture and sights.\nTheatre and cabaret revues.\nThe municipal theater (&lt;a href=\"Stadttheater%20Minden\"&gt;Stadttheater Minden&lt;/a&gt;) celebrated its centenary in 2008. The town supports the regular symphony concerts of the North West German Philharmonic Orchestra (&lt;a href=\"Nordwestdeutsche%20Philharmonie\"&gt;Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie&lt;/a&gt;), which take place in the theatre. Since 2002 a project (\"&lt;a href=\"Der%20Ring%20in%20Minden\"&gt;Der Ring in Minden&lt;/a&gt;\") has been running to perform all the operas of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Richard Wagner&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther theatre and cultural events occur with private sponsorship and are held in such locations as the civic centre (\"B\u00fcrgerzentrum\") and the \"Theater am Weingarten\". There are also theatre groups without fixed performance venues.\nMinden is the original location of the nationally known amateur cabaret, \"Mindener Stichlinge\". Its foundation in 1966 makes it the oldest active cabaret in Germany. The town awards a prize to support literary-political cabarets. The 4,000 euro prize, awarded every two years, is named \"Kabarett-F\u00f6rderpreis Mindener Stichling\", and is sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Melitta\"&gt;Melitta company&lt;/a&gt; as well as the local savings bank (\"Sparkasse Minden-L\u00fcbbecke\").\nMuseums.\nMinden has a municipal archive and two significant museums. The Prussia Museum (\"Preu\u00dfenmuseum Minden\") is one of two museums of Prussian history in North Rhine-Westphalia. It is quartered in old barracks on \"Simeonsplatz\" (Simeon Square). The building served the old Minden Fortress which influenced the town until its demolition in 1873.\nThe second one is the Minden Museum of History, Cultural Studies and Folklore (\"Mindener Museum f\u00fcr Geschichte, Landes- und Volkskunde\"), housed in a Weser Renaissance style row of patrician houses (\"Museumszeile\"). The attached Coffee Museum (\"Kaffee-Museum\") focuses on the 100-year-old coffee producer, Melitta.\nThe Dolls' Museum (\"Puppenmuseum\") is a private initiative.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Westphalian%20Mill%20Route\"&gt;Westphalian Mill Route&lt;/a&gt; is the first of its kind and connects the many windmills on the plains of the Minden countryside. These had already been recognized and preserved as technical monuments in the 1960s. Most of these relics of the 19th century have been restored.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Minden%20Museum%20Railway\"&gt;Minden Museum Railway&lt;/a&gt; operates with old Prussian rolling stock on the old tracks of the Minden District Railway. It is famous for harking back to traditional Prussia.\nBuildings.\n&lt;a href=\"Minden%20Cathedral\"&gt;Minden Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; dates from the 11th century, the &lt;a href=\"westwerk\"&gt;westwerk&lt;/a&gt; with its entrance fa\u00e7ade built in &lt;a href=\"Romanesque%20architecture\"&gt;Romanesque&lt;/a&gt; style, while the early &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20architecture\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nave\"&gt;nave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aisle\"&gt;aisle&lt;/a&gt;s date from the 13th Century. The early settlement on the lower town terrace surrounded the cathedral. Medieval building have been replaced later on, the whole area was severely destroyed in World War's bomb attacks. The cathedral has been reconstructed by architect &lt;a href=\"Werner%20March\"&gt;Werner March&lt;/a&gt; until 1957. The rebuilt town hall with its picturesque 13th century &lt;a href=\"Arcade%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;arcade&lt;/a&gt; is placed 150 meters to the west.\nThe market square is surrounded by buildings in the 19th century style of &lt;a href=\"historicism\"&gt;historicism&lt;/a&gt;. The impressive fa\u00e7ade of house \"Flamme/Schmieding\" obtained a twice daily clock display in 2010. It features the popular &lt;a href=\"origin%20myth\"&gt;origin myth&lt;/a&gt; of last independent Saxon leader Duke &lt;a href=\"Widukind\"&gt;Widukind&lt;/a&gt; shaking hands with &lt;a href=\"Charlemagne\"&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/a&gt;. They give the oath: \"diese Burg soll nun \u201a\u2018min\u2018\u2018 und \u201a\u2018din\u2018\u2018 sein\" (this fort shall now be mine and thine), thus naming Minden.\nThe main &lt;a href=\"pedestrian%20zone\"&gt;pedestrian zone&lt;/a&gt; in the commercial centre of Minden extends from the market place to the north (\"Scharn\") and then turning rectangular in the \"B\u00e4ckerstra\u00dfe\" (Bakers' Street) eastward to the Weser. The original buildings were usually replaced in the late 19th century, but some show reconstructed fa\u00e7ades in the &lt;a href=\"Weser%20Renaissance\"&gt;Weser Renaissance&lt;/a&gt; manner. North of the Bakers' Street there are few 17th to 18th century half-&lt;a href=\"timber%20framing\"&gt;timber framing&lt;/a&gt; buildings and the secularized St John's church, now being an event location (\"B\u00fcrgerzentrum (B\u00dcZ)\").\nThe pedestrian zone continues the market place to the south as \"Obermarktstra\u00dfe\" (Upper market street) and leads to the upper town centre, its skyline dominated from the three churches of (from south to north) St Simeon, St Martin and St Mary, the tower of the latter being an eye-catcher over a long distance. In the southwestern part of the town centre many 16th to 18th century residential buildings have remained intact.\nThe upper town is on a short way accessible from the market place by the St Martin's steps (\"Martinitreppe\"). It ends at the St Martin's churchyard (\"Martinikirchhof\"), today a parking area surrounded by the St Martin's church, the Old Mint (\"Alte M\u00fcnze\"), the oldest profane stone building of Minden and one of the oldest in Westphalia, the \"Schwedensch\u00e4nke\" (Swedish tavern, reminding of the Swedish occupation during the 30 Years War), the renewed &lt;a href=\"synagogue\"&gt;synagogue&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"Granary\" (\"Proviant-Magazin\", now used as \"Weser-Kolleg\" school) and adjacent \"Army Bakery (\"Heeresb\u00e4ckerei\", now used as St Martin's parish centre) as military buildings of the 19th century. The last two buildings belong to the so-called Schinkel buildings (\"Schinkelbauten\") as well as some buildings round the Simeon place south of the centre, for their style shows great resemblance to the manner of the famous Prussian architect &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Friedrich%20Schinkel\"&gt;Karl Friedrich Schinkel&lt;/a&gt;. One of the smallest buildings in Minden is the \"Windloch\" (wind hole) near St Martin's.\nThe old town (now the town centre) is surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"Glacis\"&gt;Glacis&lt;/a&gt;, a green belt replacing the fortifications after their demolition. Some great public buildings have been placed in that area since 1880 to the very modern times: the \"Ratsgymnasium\", the \"Kurt-Tucholsky-Gesamtschule\", the \"Herdergymnasium\", the centre of justice, the \"Domschule\", the Regional Government's building and the old district administration building (now the local archive) \u2013 both in &lt;a href=\"neo-renaissance\"&gt;neo-renaissance&lt;/a&gt; style, and the new district administration building.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Minden%20station\"&gt;station&lt;/a&gt; near to the frontier between the Kingdoms of Prussia and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hanover\"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt;, the railway station was strongly fortified from the beginning in 1847. Impressive relicts of the station fortification have still remained. The station building itself is classified as historical monument.\nThe picturesque \"Fischerstadt\" (fishermens' town) lies northeast of the town centre along the Weser, where remnants of the old town fortification wall are reconstructed.\nThe Kampa-Halle is a large gym-complex for sports and other events. A new event hall is to be planned at the site of the demolished goods station.\nIn the old villages now being town quarters a lot of half-timbered houses have remained.\n\"Schloss Haddenhausen\" (Haddenhausen Palace) is a 17th-century Weserrenaissance style manor house, still owned by the &lt;a href=\"Bussche%20family\"&gt;Bussche family&lt;/a&gt;, on the outskirts of the town.\nMonuments.\nThe town of Minden contains several monuments harking back to Prussian history. The monument of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Elector\"&gt;Great Elector&lt;/a&gt;, the only one for a &lt;a href=\"sovereign\"&gt;sovereign&lt;/a&gt; in Minden, stands alongside the Weser bridgehead to commemorate Minden's first Prussian ruler. In the glacis area, monuments are placed for the infantry brigade stationed in Minden, for an artillery regiment, for the World War I deads of the pioneer battalion, and the deads of both World Wars. Another memorial is topped by a bust of &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Ludwig%20Jahn\"&gt;Friedrich Ludwig Jahn&lt;/a&gt;, the \"father of gymnastics\", and reminds especially at the dead gymnasts of Minden. The monument to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Minden\"&gt;Battle of Minden&lt;/a&gt; is in the Todtenhausen quarter of the town; it commemorates the decisive victory of the forces of Great Britain and their German allies. On the Great cathedral court an obelisk-like monument, topped by the &lt;a href=\"Prussian%20eagle\"&gt;Prussian eagle&lt;/a&gt;, reminds at the Prussian victories in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Schleswig%20War\"&gt;Second Schleswig War&lt;/a&gt; of 1864 and the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Prussian%20War\"&gt;Austro-Prussian War&lt;/a&gt; of 1866. A sarcophagus-like memorial, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, reminds at major general \"Ernst Michael von Schwichow\", fortress commander of Minden.\nThe \"Weserspucker\" (Weser spitter) in the pedestrian zone symbolizes the connection with the river; he is spitting in intervalls.\nThe new steel sculpture named \"Keilst\u00fcck\" (Wedge piece) by artist Wilfried Hageb\u00f6lling, that decorates the \"Martinikirchhof\" since 1987, has been disputed controversially in public opinion. In the early 2000s the town council decided to remove the sculpture, but caused thereby legal proceedings with the artist; finally the court of appeal confirmed the location at the original place.\nParks.\nThe botanical garden is centrally located on the site of the old cemetery and features old tree specimens and thematic gardens. The site for burials was transferred in 1904 to a new site on the Weser north of the town centre. The \"Glacis\" stems from the Fortress Minden. The present wooded parklike green belt was started after the demolition of the fortress walls. The post &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic\"&gt;Napoleonic&lt;/a&gt; fortifications had replaced older walls stemming from the Middle Ages.\nSport.\nThe handball club &lt;a href=\"GWD%20Minden\"&gt;GWD Minden&lt;/a&gt; has played in the &lt;a href=\"Handball-Bundesliga\"&gt;Handball-Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; (national handball league) with some interruptions since the league's founding in 1966. GWD now plays in the \"Kampa-Halle\". It won the German title twice. Many of its players have been on the national team. Its previous venue the Weserstadion is now used for track and field and football (soccer).\nMinden has a reputation as a water sports centre aided by its location on the Weser. \"MTV 1860 Minden e.V\" is the largest and oldest sport club with gymnastics, fencing, handball, canoe racing, judo, swimming, volleyball and other popular sports. Its boathouse is at the confluence of the Bastau stream into the Weser. The canoe club \"KSG Minden e.V.\" has its clubhouse upstream. It is the local organizer of dragon boat races. \"TV Jahn\" Sportclub has a canoe and kayak group below the main Weser bridge. The \"Bessel-Ruder-Club e.V.\" is a rowing club stemming from the rowing activities of the Bessel and Herder Gymnasiums (high schools). The yearly \"Mindener Hafen-Sprint\" is one of the largest student regattas in Germany.\n\"Mindener Freischie\u00dfen\".\nThe \"Mindener Freischie\u00dfen\" (Minden Free Shooting) is a unique public festival that takes place usually every two years. It is arranged by the military-like organized \"Mindener B\u00fcrgerbatallion\" (Minden Citizen Battalion) with the \"Stadtmajor\" (Town Major) on top. The battalion is divided into six companies, a squadron and a drummer corps, each of them headed by a captain.\nIn the Middle Ages the right of self-government corresponded with the duty of self-defence, and the citizen battalion was established for this purpose. Since 1682 the obligatory shooting exercises were arranged as a public festival, and as a reward the best shooter was exempted from taxation in the current year. The festival's name refers to this rule. In 1685 the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Elector\"&gt;Great Elector&lt;/a&gt; changed the rule, so that the winner got a reward of 50 &lt;a href=\"Thaler\"&gt;Thaler&lt;/a&gt;. This rule has remained to present days, but today it is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20ministers-president%20of%20North%20Rhine-Westphalia\"&gt;Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt; as legal successor of the Prince-Elector who pays the honour sum in present currency. Due to the biennial rhythm two winners are determined.\nThe festival usually takes place in June or July from Thursday to Sunday in the town centre. The Freischie\u00dfen should not be confused with a marksmen's festival.\nOther Events.\nThe \"Mindener Messe\" is a one-week &lt;a href=\"Traveling%20carnival\"&gt;travelling funfair&lt;/a&gt; every May and every November on the wide event-place \"Kanzler's Weide\" at the right Weser shore; it was founded in 1526 by the Prince-Bishop.\nMany organizations participate in the organization of the major water sport festival \"Blaues Band der Weser\", which is carried out biennial.\nThe \"Hahler Kranzreiten\" takes place every summer in the quarter of Hahlen. It is an equestrian competition where the contestants try to catch a gallow-hanging garland while riding on a galloping horse in several rounds; every following round the gallow is lifted to a higher position.\nTraditional Marksmen's festivals (\"&lt;a href=\"Sch%C3%BCtzenfest\"&gt;Sch\u00fctzenfest&lt;/a&gt;\") are arranged by marksmen's clubs (\"Sch\u00fctzenverein\") in some quarters of Minden like in many other German cities.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nTransport.\nRail and bus.\n&lt;a href=\"Minden%20station\"&gt;Minden station&lt;/a&gt; is on the &lt;a href=\"Hanover%E2%80%93Minden%20railway\"&gt;Hanover\u2013Minden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hamm%E2%80%93Minden%20railway\"&gt;Hamm-Minden lines&lt;/a&gt;, which are part of the main lines connecting &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Ruhr\"&gt;Ruhr&lt;/a&gt; area with &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amsterdam\"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; with Berlin, as well as the secondary &lt;a href=\"Weser-Aller%20Railway\"&gt;Weser-Aller line&lt;/a&gt; between Minden and &lt;a href=\"Nienburg%2C%20Lower%20Saxony\"&gt;Nienburg&lt;/a&gt;. The railway station is a stop for local and express trains such as &lt;a href=\"Intercity-Express\"&gt;Intercity-Express&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"InterCity\"&gt;InterCity&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegional lines:\nMinden station is terminal of line S 1 of the &lt;a href=\"Hanover%20S-Bahn\"&gt;Hanover S-Bahn&lt;/a&gt; to Hanover. All passenger platforms are accessible to handicapped persons. There is bicycle parking and a ticket automat.\nThe previous narrow-gauge line network of the Minden Districht Railways (\"Mindener Kreisbahnen\"), later converted to standard gauge, has been reduced to two freight lines, one from Minden to Hille (Mittelland Canal port) in the west and the other one to Kleinenbremen in the east. The &lt;a href=\"Minden%20Museum%20Railway\"&gt;Minden Museum Railway&lt;/a&gt; (\"Museumseisenbahn Minden\") operates restored locomotives and rolling stock on these lines, in Kleinenbremen with the end at the &lt;a href=\"visitors%27%20mine\"&gt;visitors' mine&lt;/a&gt; in Kleinenbremen.\nThe main station is connected by bus of the \"Teutoburger Wald Verkehr (TWV)\" with the central bus terminal (\"Zentraler Omnibusbahnhof\", \"ZOB\") in the town centre, where 13 bus lines rendezvous every half hour. The local buses are coordinated with the regional buses to places such as Bad Oeynhausen, L\u00fcbbecke, Espelkamp and Petershagen.\nRoads.\nThe town is close to the &lt;a href=\"Bundesautobahn%202\"&gt;Autobahn A 2&lt;/a&gt; from Berlin to the Ruhr and the &lt;a href=\"Bundesautobahn%2030\"&gt;A 30&lt;/a&gt; to Amsterdam. The &lt;a href=\"Bundesstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;federal roads&lt;/a&gt; 61 and 65 cross in the town, the federal road 482 touches Minden as eastern ring road ansd connects the town with the next A 2-junction in Porta Westfalica. The divided highway south of the town travels through a tunnel to Porta Wesfalica and on to Bad Oeynhausen. The Federal road 482 runs east of the town and connects the A 2 to the south, and goes toward Nienburg to the north. Two semicircle ring roads go around the town itself, the inner route 61 provides a town by-pass. This inner ring is almost completely four-lane. The town centre has pay car parks and an automated guide to empty spaces.\nWaterways and harbours.\nMinden is an important junction for inland waterways. It is the crossing of the navigable Weser and the &lt;a href=\"Mittelland%20Canal\"&gt;Mittelland Canal&lt;/a&gt;. Two locks (built 1914 and 2018) connect the River with the canal to overcome a difference in height of 13 m. The &lt;a href=\"multimodal%20transport\"&gt;multimodal transport&lt;/a&gt; harbours on both Weser and Mittellankanal are experiencing increasing volume because of the good waterway connections to the seaports of Bremen, Bremerhaven, and Hamburg. A new container port is in construction to the east of the present Mittellandkanal harbour, the so-called \"RegioPort &lt;a href=\"Ostwestfalen-Lippe\"&gt;OWL&lt;/a&gt;\", at the boundary to Lower Saxony, being a seldom example of cross-border planning in the Federal Republic.\nMinden is location of a section of the Waterways and Shipping Authority Mittelland Canal / &lt;a href=\"Elbe%20Lateral%20Canal\"&gt;Elbe Lateral Canal&lt;/a&gt; (\"Wasserstra\u00dfen- und Schifffahrtsamt Mittelllandkanal/ Elbe-Seitenkanal\") for the administration of the maintenance and regulation of the Weser and Canal waterways. An information centre is located at the &lt;a href=\"Minden%20Aqueduct\"&gt;Minden Aqueduct&lt;/a&gt; (\"Wasserstra\u00dfenkreuz Minden\"), where the canal system and the function of the locks are explained.\nWeser bridges.\nThere are seven overpasses over the Weser in Minden, three road bridges, a railroad bridge, one pedestrian bridge and a double aqueduct for the canal. The main town bridge connects the town centre with the eastern suburbs and the railway station. The two relief bridges from the 1970s, the &lt;a href=\"Gustav%20Heinemann\"&gt;Gustav Heinemann Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in the north and the &lt;a href=\"Theodor%20Heuss\"&gt;Theodor Heuss Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in the south, are four-lane and lead traffic away from town centre. A railway bridge carries the Minden District Railways' tracks over the Weser toward the main station. The Glacis bridge is a pedestrian suspension bridge that provides access to the \"Kanzlers Weide\", a large parking area and event place east of the town centre.\nThe next nearby road bridges are south at Porta Wesfalica and north at Petershagen.\nBicycle.\nThe town is on the bicycle routes \"M\u00fchlenroute\" (mill route) and \"Weserradweg\" (water bicycle path). It is the departure point for the \"Wellness-Radroute\" There is a bike station at the railroad station complete with servicing. The town belongs to working cooperative \"Fahrradfreundliche Stadte und Gemeinden in NRW\" (bicycle friendly communities in North Rhine-Westphalia). The goal is to increase bicycle traffic to over 20 percent of the total. \"Fahrradf\u00f6rderung Minden\", is a volunteer group that develops recommendations to government. It is involved in working on an overall bicycle traffic concept, whose implementation is delayed by budget problems.\nEconomy.\nMinden is the economic centre of the district and the bordering region of Lower Saxony. It is part of the agglomeration corridor that extends along the A 2 Autobahn from Minden through Herford, Bielefeld, G\u00fctersloh and on to the &lt;a href=\"Ruhr\"&gt;Ruhr&lt;/a&gt; area. Traffic connections by railway, highway, federal routes and waterways are favourable factors for growing industry and trade with about 3,300 firms and 40,000 employees in regular conditions (2020). A multitude of economic branches include the chemical, metalworking, electronic, paper, ceramic, and woodworking spheres, located on industrial areas mainly in the west and east parts of the town.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"three-sector%20model\"&gt;three-sector model&lt;/a&gt;, the Minden employees work in the &lt;a href=\"Primary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy\"&gt;primary sector&lt;/a&gt; (agriculture, forestry) at 0.1%, in the &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy\"&gt;secondary sector&lt;/a&gt; (industrial production) at 27.6%, and in the &lt;a href=\"Tertiary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy\"&gt;tertiary sector&lt;/a&gt; (mainly service and administration) at 72.4%; these numbers are roughly in accordance to the average of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The number of about 28,000 daily &lt;a href=\"commuter\"&gt;commuter&lt;/a&gt;s exceeds the 17,000 citizens of Minden, who works outside the town's limits. The &lt;a href=\"Disposable%20and%20discretionary%20income\"&gt;disposable income&lt;/a&gt; per capita amounts slowly below to the average of North Rhine-Westphalia.\nLike in other towns, some great retail areas have deloped apart from the centre in the outer parts of the town. A very special problem of Minden results from the local government reorganization of 1973, when most of the surrounding suburbs were adjointed to the town administratively. The southern suburbs of Barkhausen and Neesen however became parts of the new founded town of &lt;a href=\"Porta%20Westfalica\"&gt;Porta Westfalica&lt;/a&gt;, that since then has developed a large trading estate (\"Porta Markt\") in the most northwestern part of its quarter Barkhausen, directly to the border of Minden. The now established shopping scene is situated extremely marginally in the Porta Westfalica area, but the distance to Minden town centre is only three kilometers; by the federal route 65 even parts of the western community of Hille and the eastern town of B\u00fcckeburg are in the &lt;a href=\"Isochrone%20map\"&gt;15-minute radius&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnterprises.\nMinden is location of several middle-sized companies. &lt;a href=\"Melitta\"&gt;Melitta&lt;/a&gt; with headquarters in Minden is well known by consumers for its coffee products.
