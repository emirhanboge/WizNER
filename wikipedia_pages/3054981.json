    "text": "A de facto currency is a unit of money that is not &lt;a href=\"legal%20tender\"&gt;legal tender&lt;/a&gt; in a country but is treated as such by most of the populace. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20dollar\"&gt;United States dollar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; are the most common de facto currencies.\nEuro.\n&lt;a href=\"Andorra%20and%20the%20euro\"&gt;Andorra&lt;/a&gt; used the euro unofficially prior to June 2013, at which point the euro became its official currency. The euro remains the de facto currency in &lt;a href=\"Kosovo%20and%20the%20euro\"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Montenegro%20and%20the%20euro\"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnited States dollar.\nCountries using the United States dollar as their de facto currency include &lt;a href=\"Aruba\"&gt;Aruba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cambodia\"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;, where most hotels, restaurants, and transportation are priced in dollars;\n&lt;a href=\"Dominican%20Republic\"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt; where it is acceptable in many places, including airports to pay temporary visa fees for non-US/Dominican visits; &lt;a href=\"Iraq\"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, where United States commercial, governmental and military involvement due to the &lt;a href=\"Iraq%20War\"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Iraqi%20Dinar\"&gt;Iraqi Dinar&lt;/a&gt;'s low value has made the US dollar highly preferred; &lt;a href=\"East%20Timor\"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"El%20Salvador\"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ecuador\"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Panama\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;.\nRussian ruble.\nThe disputed territories of &lt;a href=\"Abkhazia\"&gt;Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Ossetia\"&gt;South Ossetia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crimea\"&gt;Crimea&lt;/a&gt; have the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20ruble\"&gt;Russian ruble&lt;/a&gt; as their de facto currency.\nSouth African rand and Botswana pula.\nDue to &lt;a href=\"hyperinflation%20in%20Zimbabwe\"&gt;hyperinflation in Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 to 2008, the government of Zimbabwe has allowed circulation of foreign currency since September 2008 and local currency became obsolete since 12 April 2009. Both &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20rand\"&gt;South African rand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Botswana%20pula\"&gt;Botswana pula&lt;/a&gt; circulate in Zimbabwe.\nCanadian dollar.\nThe small &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Pierre%20and%20Miquelon\"&gt;St. Pierre and Miquelon&lt;/a&gt; has the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20dollar\"&gt;Canadian dollar&lt;/a&gt; as its de facto currency.\nHong Kong Dollar.\nThe Hong Kong Dollar is widely accepted in Macau, even though it has not gained official recognition from Autoridade Monet\u00e1ria de Macau (AMCM) as legal tender in Macau. The Macauese Pacata is pegged to the Hong Kong Dollar at 1.029(buy)/1.032(sell). However, many merchants who accept Hong Kong Dollars may offer to pay the difference between two currencies, such practice is often called '\u4e0d\u88dc\u6c34' in Chinese. If merchandise priced in Patacas is paid for in Hong Kong Dollars, and if merchants practice '\u4e0d\u88dc\u6c34', prices in Patacas may be rounded up to the equivalent in Hong Kong Dollars, and merchants would offer change in Hong Kong dollars or the amount of Hong Kong Dollars paid would be automatically converted into Patacas and merchants would then offer change in Patacas."
