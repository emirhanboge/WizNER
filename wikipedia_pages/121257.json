    "text": "Askov is a &lt;a href=\"General-law%20municipality%23Minnesota\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pine%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Pine County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The population was 364 at the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20State%20Highway%2023\"&gt;Minnesota State Highway 23&lt;/a&gt; serves as a main route in the community, and &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2035%20in%20Minnesota\"&gt;Interstate 35&lt;/a&gt; is nearby.\nHistory.\nThe location of the village was originally within the lands of the village of &lt;a href=\"Partridge%20Township%2C%20Pine%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Partridge&lt;/a&gt;, at a stop far outside the original village along &lt;a href=\"Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28U.S.%29\"&gt;Great Northern Railway&lt;/a&gt;; here a post office was set up, first called Partridge from 1889\u20131909, before changing its name to Askov in 1909. Most of the original village of Partridge was destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hinckley%20Fire\"&gt;1894 Hinckley fire&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe immigrants to the Danish 'colony' of Askov were nationalistic &lt;a href=\"Lutheran\"&gt;Lutheran&lt;/a&gt; followers of the theologian and cultural leader, Bishop &lt;a href=\"N.%20F.%20S.%20Grundtvig\"&gt;N. F. S. Grundtvig&lt;/a&gt;, romanticising the superiority of Danish culture and emphasising the importance of speech and education (a motto was \"enlightenment must be our delight). Danish immigrants had up till this point been mostly &lt;a href=\"economic%20migrant\"&gt;economic migrant&lt;/a&gt;s fleeing poverty in Denmark, but the first migrants to Askov were almost all Grundvigian Danes from elsewhere in the USA. The \"Dansk Folkesamfund\" (Danish Peoples Society) was founded in 1887 by &lt;a href=\"Svend%20Grundtvig\"&gt;Svend Hersleb Grundtvig&lt;/a&gt;, the son of N. F. S. Grundtvig, to conserve Danish social heritage and promote immigration to the USA. The \"Dansk Folkesamfund\", with help from the railroad company, bought the parcels of land around the train station and post office in 1906 and by 1909 had sold the 45 plots exclusively to Danish settlers, some 25 families. The name \"Askov\" was chosen to commemorate the larger village of in Denmark which is the site of one of the largest &lt;a href=\"folk%20high%20schools\"&gt;folk high schools&lt;/a&gt; (\"Askov H\u00f8jskole\") founded by N. F. S. Grundtvig. The name Askov is derived from 'ash forest' (ask skov) in Danish. By 1916 almost a thousand settlers of Danish descent lived here, although 1920 USA census data records only 242 inhabitants in Askov and most people lived in the village of &lt;a href=\"Partridge%20Township%2C%20Pine%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Partridge&lt;/a&gt; -this was thus the largest concentration of Danish settlers in Minnesota. The new village was incorporated on April 25, 1918, and officially separated from the &lt;a href=\"Partridge%20Township%2C%20Pine%20County%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;township&lt;/a&gt; as the City of Askov on April 8, 1921. \nInitially the main economic activity was dairy (the first cooperative creamery being built in 1910) supplemented by mixed intensive farming. Nearly all the streets in Askov have been given &lt;a href=\"Danish%20language\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; names.\nDespite the Danish history, the modern population has the following ancestries: German (20.8%), Irish (12.0%), Norwegian (7.3%), Danish (6.3%), Scandinavian (5.2%), American (4.7%).\nThe fashion brand &lt;a href=\"Askov%20Finlayson\"&gt;Askov Finlayson&lt;/a&gt; was named after this city and neighboring &lt;a href=\"Finlayson%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Finlayson, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, which share a freeway exit on &lt;a href=\"I-35\"&gt;I-35&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;United States Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the village has a total area of , all land.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kettle%20River%20%28St.%20Croix%20River%29\"&gt;Kettle River&lt;/a&gt; and Partridge Creek both flow nearby. &lt;a href=\"Banning%20State%20Park\"&gt;Banning State Park&lt;/a&gt; is also nearby.\nDemographics.\n2010 census.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"census\"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; of 2010, there were 364 people, 171 households, and 88 families living in the village.
