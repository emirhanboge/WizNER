    "text": "Chebfun is a &lt;a href=\"Free%20and%20open%20source%20software\"&gt;free/open-source&lt;/a&gt; software system written in &lt;a href=\"MATLAB\"&gt;MATLAB&lt;/a&gt; for numerical computation with functions of a real variable. It is based on the idea of overloading MATLAB's commands for vectors and matrices to analogous commands for functions and operators. Thus, for example, whereas the SUM command in MATLAB adds up the elements of a vector, the SUM command in Chebfun evaluates a definite integral. Similarly the backslash command in MATLAB becomes a Chebfun command for solving differential equations.\nThe mathematical basis of Chebfun is numerical algorithms involving piecewise polynomial interpolants and &lt;a href=\"Chebyshev%20polynomials\"&gt;Chebyshev polynomials&lt;/a&gt;, and this is where the name \"Cheb\" comes from. The package aims to combine the feel of symbolic computing systems like &lt;a href=\"Maple%20%28software%29\"&gt;Maple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathematica\"&gt;Mathematica&lt;/a&gt; with the speed of floating-point numerics.\nThe Chebfun project is based in the Mathematical Institute at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt; and was initiated in 2002 by &lt;a href=\"Lloyd%20N.%20Trefethen\"&gt;Lloyd N. Trefethen&lt;/a&gt; and his student Zachary Battles. The most recent version, Version 5.7.0, was released on June 2, 2017.\nChebfun2, a software system that extends Chebfun to two dimensions, was made publicly available on the 4th of March 2013. Following Chebfun2, Spherefun (extension to the unit sphere) and Chebfun3 (extension to three dimensions) were made publicly available in May and July 2016.\nExample usage.\nA user may begin by initialising the variable x, on the interval [0,10], say.\n\u00bb x = chebfun('x',[0,10]); \nThis variable can now be used to perform further computations, for example, computing and plotting roots of a function:\n\u00bb f = sin(x) + sin(x.^2); plot(f)\n\u00bb r = roots(f); hold on, plot(r,f(r),'.r'), hold off \nThe definite integral can be computed with:\n\u00bb sum(f) \nans \n = 2.422742429006079 "
