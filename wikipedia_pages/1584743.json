    "text": "A curule seat is a design of a (usually) foldable and transportable &lt;a href=\"chair\"&gt;chair&lt;/a&gt; noted for its uses in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Rome\"&gt;Ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt; and Europe through to the 20th century. Its status in early Rome as a symbol of political or military power carried over to other civilizations, as it was also used in this regard by kings in Europe, &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;, and others.\nHistory.\nAncient Rome.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Roman Republic&lt;/a&gt;, and Empire, the curule chair (\"sella curulis\", supposedly from \"currus\", \"chariot\") was the seat upon which magistrates holding &lt;a href=\"imperium\"&gt;imperium&lt;/a&gt; were entitled to sit. This includes &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Dictator\"&gt;dictator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magister%20equitum\"&gt;magistri equitum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20consul\"&gt;consul&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"praetor\"&gt;praetor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"curule%20aedile\"&gt;curule aedile&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"promagistrates\"&gt;promagistrates&lt;/a&gt;, temporary or de facto holders of such offices. Additionally, the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20censor\"&gt;censor&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Flamen\"&gt;Flamen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Jupiter%20%28god%29\"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Flamen%20Dialis\"&gt;Flamen Dialis&lt;/a&gt;) were also allowed to sit on a curule seat, though these positions did not hold imperium. &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Livius\"&gt;Livy&lt;/a&gt; writes that the three \"&lt;a href=\"flamen\"&gt;flamines maiores&lt;/a&gt;\" or high priests of the &lt;a href=\"Capitoline%20Triad%23Archaic%20Triad\"&gt;Archaic Triad&lt;/a&gt; of major gods were each granted the honor of the curule chair.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Livy\"&gt;Livy&lt;/a&gt; the curule seat, like the &lt;a href=\"Toga\"&gt;Roman toga&lt;/a&gt;, originated in &lt;a href=\"Etruria\"&gt;Etruria&lt;/a&gt;, and it has been used on surviving Etruscan monuments to identify magistrates. However, much earlier stools supported on a cross-frame are known from the &lt;a href=\"New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt\"&gt;New Kingdom of Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. One of the earliest recorded examples of the curule chair proper was in 494 BC when the honour of a curule chair in the &lt;a href=\"circus%20maximus\"&gt;circus maximus&lt;/a&gt; was awarded to the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20dictator\"&gt;Roman dictator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Manius%20Valerius%20Maximus\"&gt;Manius Valerius Maximus&lt;/a&gt; as a result of his &lt;a href=\"Roman-Sabine%20wars%23Engagement%20in%20494%20BC\"&gt;victory over the Sabines&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Cassius%20Dio\"&gt;Cassius Dio&lt;/a&gt;, early in 44 BC a senate decree granted &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Caesar\"&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/a&gt; the curule seat everywhere except in the theatre, where his &lt;a href=\"gilding\"&gt;gilded&lt;/a&gt; chair and jeweled crown were carried in, putting him on a par with the gods. As a form of &lt;a href=\"throne\"&gt;throne&lt;/a&gt;, the \"sella\" might be given as an honor to foreign kings recognized formally as &lt;a href=\"Socii\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Populus%20Romanus\"&gt;Roman people&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Roman%20senate\"&gt;senate&lt;/a&gt;. The curule chair is also used on Roman medals as well as funerary monuments to express a curule magistracy; when traversed by a &lt;a href=\"Hasta%20%28spear%29\"&gt;hasta&lt;/a&gt;, it is the symbol of &lt;a href=\"Juno%20%28mythology%29\"&gt;Juno&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Rome, the curule chair was traditionally made of or veneered with &lt;a href=\"ivory\"&gt;ivory&lt;/a&gt;, with curved legs forming a wide X; it had no back, and low arms. Although often of luxurious construction, this chair was meant to be uncomfortable to sit on for long periods of time, the double symbolism being that the official was expected to carry out his public function in an efficient and timely manner, and that his office, being an office of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;, was temporary, not perennial. The chair could be folded, and thus was easily transportable; this accords with its original function for magisterial and promagisterial commanders in the field. It developed a &lt;a href=\"hieratic\"&gt;hieratic&lt;/a&gt; significance, expressed in fictive curule seats on funerary monuments, a symbol of power which was never entirely lost in post-Roman European tradition. 6th-century consular ivory &lt;a href=\"diptych\"&gt;diptych&lt;/a&gt;s of Orestes and of Constantinus each depict the consul seated on an elaborate curule seat with crossed animal legs.\nOther uses.\nAlong the &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Road\"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; the folding seat of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Eastern Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; made its way to China, where in various forms including the \"hu chuang\"\u2014 the \"barbarian bed\"\u2014 it \"transformed the dress, architecture and lifestyle of the Chinese\" In &lt;a href=\"Han%20China\"&gt;Han China&lt;/a&gt; the folding chair made its first literary mark in the 2nd century AD, used out-of-doors in a military rather than domestic setting, and from the way it was addressed in a poem by &lt;a href=\"Yu%20Jianwu\"&gt;Yu Jianwu&lt;/a&gt;, written about 552\nBy the name handed down you are from a foreign region&lt;br&gt;\ncoming into [China] and being used in the capital&lt;br&gt;\nWith legs leaning your frame adjusts by itself&lt;br&gt;\nWith limbs slanting your body levels by itself...\nit is clear the cross-framed folding seat was intended.\nIn Gaul the &lt;a href=\"Merovingian\"&gt;Merovingian&lt;/a&gt; successors to Roman power employed the curule seat as an emblem of their right to dispense justice, and their &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Capet\"&gt;Capetian&lt;/a&gt; successors retained the iconic seat: the \"&lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Dagobert\"&gt;Throne of Dagobert&lt;/a&gt;\", of cast bronze retaining traces of its former gilding, is conserved in the &lt;a href=\"Biblioth%C3%A8que%20nationale%20de%20France\"&gt;Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France&lt;/a&gt;. The \"throne of Dagobert\" is first mentioned in the 12th century, already as a treasured relic, by &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20Suger\"&gt;Abbot Suger&lt;/a&gt;, who claims in his \"Administratione\", \"We also restored the noble throne of the glorious King &lt;a href=\"Dagobert%20I\"&gt;Dagobert&lt;/a&gt;, on which, as tradition relates, the Frankish kings sat to receive the homage of their nobles after they had assumed power. We did so in recognition of its exalted function and because of the value of the work itself.\" Abbot Suger added bronze upper members with foliated scrolls and a back-piece. The \"Throne of Dagobert\" was coarsely repaired and used for the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Napoleon\"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 15th century, a characteristic &lt;a href=\"X-chair\"&gt;folding-chair&lt;/a&gt; of both Italy and Spain was made of numerous shaped cross-framed elements, joined to wooden members that rested on the floor and further made rigid with a wooden back. 19th-century dealers and collectors termed these \"&lt;a href=\"Dante%20Chair\"&gt;Dante Chair&lt;/a&gt;s\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Savonarola%20Chair\"&gt;Savonarola Chair&lt;/a&gt;s\", with disregard to the centuries intervening between the two figures. Examples of curule seats were redrawn from a 15th-century manuscript of the \"Roman de Renaude de Montauban\" and published in &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Shaw%20%28antiquary%29\"&gt;Henry Shaw&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Specimens of Ancient Furniture\" (1836).\nThe 15th or early 16th-century curule seat that survives at &lt;a href=\"York%20Minster\"&gt;York Minster&lt;/a&gt;, originally entirely covered with textiles, has rear members extended upwards to form a back, between which a rich textile was stretched. The cross-framed armchair, no longer actually a folding chair, continued to have regal connotations. &lt;a href=\"James%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;James I of England&lt;/a&gt; was portrayed with such a chair, its framing entirely covered with a richly patterned &lt;a href=\"silk%20damask\"&gt;silk damask&lt;/a&gt; textile, with decorative nailing, in &lt;a href=\"Paul%20van%20Somer%20I\"&gt;Paul van Somer&lt;/a&gt;'s portrait. Similar early 17th-century cross-framed seats survive at &lt;a href=\"Knole\"&gt;Knole&lt;/a&gt;, perquisites from a royal event.\nThe photo of actor Edwin Booth as &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Hamlet\"&gt;Hamlet&lt;/a&gt; poses him in a regal cross-framed chair, considered suitably medieval in 1870.\nThe form found its way into stylish but non-royal decoration in the archaeological second phase of &lt;a href=\"neoclassicism\"&gt;neoclassicism&lt;/a&gt; in the early 19th century. An unusually early example of this revived form is provided by the large sets of richly carved and gilded \"pliants\" (folding stools) forming part of long sets with matching \"tabourets\" delivered in 1786 to the royal ch\u00e2teaux of &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Compi%C3%A8gne\"&gt;Compi\u00e8gne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Fontainebleau\"&gt;Fontainebleau&lt;/a&gt;. With their Imperial Roman connotations, the backless curule seats found their way into furnishings for Napoleon, who moved some of the former royal \"pliants\" into his state bedchamber at Fontainebleau. Further examples were ordered, in the newest Empire taste: &lt;a href=\"Jacob-Desmalter\"&gt;Jacob-Desmalter&lt;/a&gt;'s seats with members in the form of carved and gilded sheathed sabres were delivered to &lt;a href=\"Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Saint-Cloud\"&gt;Saint-Cloud&lt;/a&gt; about 1805. Cross-framed drawing-room chairs are illustrated in &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Sheraton\"&gt;Thomas Sheraton&lt;/a&gt;'s last production, \"The Cabinet-Maker, Upholsterer and General Artist's Encyclopaedia\" (1806), and in &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Hope%20%281769-1831%29\"&gt;Thomas Hope&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Household Furniture\" (1807).\nWith the decline of archaeological neoclassicism, the curule chair disappeared; it is not found among &lt;a href=\"Biedermeier\"&gt;Biedermeier&lt;/a&gt; and other Late Classical furnishing schemes."
