    "text": "Procambarus clarkii, known variously as the red swamp crayfish, Louisiana crawfish or mudbug, is a &lt;a href=\"species\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cambaridae\"&gt;cambarid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"crayfish\"&gt;crayfish&lt;/a&gt; native to freshwater bodies of &lt;a href=\"northern%20Mexico\"&gt;northern Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"southern%20United%20States\"&gt;southern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"southeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;southeastern United States&lt;/a&gt;, but also &lt;a href=\"introduced%20species\"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere (both in &lt;a href=\"North%20America\"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; and other continents), where it is often an &lt;a href=\"invasive%20species\"&gt;invasive pest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\n\"P. clarkii\" is typically dark red, with long claws and head, small or no spines on the sides of its &lt;a href=\"carapace\"&gt;carapace&lt;/a&gt; just below the head, and rows of bright red bumps on the front and side of the first leg.\nRange and range expansion.\nThe native range of \"P. clarkii\" is from northern &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and far southeastern &lt;a href=\"New%20Mexico\"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, through the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Gulf States&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Florida%20Panhandle\"&gt;Florida Panhandle&lt;/a&gt;, as well as inland north through the &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20Basin\"&gt;Mississippi Basin&lt;/a&gt; to southern &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. It has also been introduced, sometimes deliberately, outside its natural range to countries in &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Americas\"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"northern%20Europe\"&gt;northern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the populations are self-maintaining but not expanding, while in &lt;a href=\"southern%20Europe\"&gt;southern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, \"P. clarkii\" is multiplying and actively colonizing new territories at the expense of the native crayfish, \"&lt;a href=\"Astacus%20astacus\"&gt;Astacus astacus&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Austropotamobius\"&gt;Austropotamobius&lt;/a&gt;\" spp. Individuals are reported to be able to cross many miles of relatively dry ground, especially in wet seasons, although the &lt;a href=\"aquarium\"&gt;aquarium&lt;/a&gt; trade and &lt;a href=\"angling\"&gt;angler&lt;/a&gt;s may have hastened the spread in some areas (anglers using \"P. clarkii\" as &lt;a href=\"fishing%20bait\"&gt;fishing bait&lt;/a&gt; are thought to have introduced it to the state of &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;). Attempts have also been made to use \"P. clarkii\" as a &lt;a href=\"biological%20control\"&gt;biological control&lt;/a&gt; organism, to reduce levels of the &lt;a href=\"snail\"&gt;snail&lt;/a&gt;s involved in the lifecycle of &lt;a href=\"schistosomiasis\"&gt;schistosomiasis&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the dispersal of \"P. clarkii\" in, for instance, &lt;a href=\"Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvasiveness.\nIn Europe, \"P. clarkii\" is included since 2016 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). This implies that this species cannot be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.\nEcology.\n\"P. clarkii\" is most commonly found in warm freshwater bodies such as slow-flowing &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"marsh\"&gt;marsh&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"reservoir\"&gt;reservoir&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"irrigation%20system\"&gt;irrigation system&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"rice%20paddies\"&gt;rice paddies&lt;/a&gt;. It is considered to be the most ecologically plastic species in the order &lt;a href=\"Decapoda\"&gt;Decapoda&lt;/a&gt;, and is able to grow quickly even in only seasonally present water, being able to tolerate dry spells of up to four months. \"P. clarkii\" grows quickly, and is capable of reaching weights in excess of and sizes of long. It is also able to tolerate slightly &lt;a href=\"salinity\"&gt;saline&lt;/a&gt; water, which is unusual for a crayfish. Additionally, \"P. clarkii\" are physiologically capable of tolerating relatively low &lt;a href=\"oxygenation%20%28environmental%29\"&gt;dissolved oxygen concentration&lt;/a&gt;s. The average lifetime of \"Procambarus clarkii\" is five years, although some individuals are known to have reached ages (in nature) of over six years.\nThe &lt;a href=\"burrowing\"&gt;burrowing&lt;/a&gt; activities of \"P. clarkii\" can lead to damage to existing water courses and to crops, particularly &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt;, and its feeding can disrupt native ecosystems. It may outcompete the native crayfish species, and is a &lt;a href=\"vector%20%28epidemiology%29\"&gt;vector&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"crayfish%20plague\"&gt;crayfish plague&lt;/a&gt; fungus \"&lt;a href=\"Aphanomyces%20astaci\"&gt;Aphanomyces astaci&lt;/a&gt;\", for crayfish virus &lt;a href=\"vibriosis\"&gt;vibriosis&lt;/a&gt; and for a number of &lt;a href=\"worm\"&gt;worm&lt;/a&gt;s parasitic on &lt;a href=\"vertebrate\"&gt;vertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s. Their burrowing activities may also be a threat to civil infrastructure such as &lt;a href=\"retention%20basin\"&gt;storm pond&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"levee\"&gt;levee&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEconomic importance.\nHarvests of \"P. clarkii\" for &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; account for a large majority of the crayfish produced in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere. Crayfish farming began in &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; in the 18th century, taking place in rice fields in a concurrent or alternate culture system. The concurrent &lt;a href=\"polyculture\"&gt;polyculture&lt;/a&gt; of rice and crayfish combination makes good use of land, resources, equipment and infrastructure already being used for rice production.\nHowever, crawfish production has decreased in recent years due to an increase of imports from &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, which is now the world's leading producer of farmed crawfish using a &lt;a href=\"rice-fish%20system\"&gt;rice-based system&lt;/a&gt;. A number of species of &lt;a href=\"crustacean\"&gt;crustacean&lt;/a&gt;s were introduced to China to create markets for aquaculture and because they are better adapted to growing in a rice field than native fish species. Rice-fish farming originated in China and is once again growing as the yields from &lt;a href=\"Green%20Revolution\"&gt;Green Revolution&lt;/a&gt; practices used to grow rice are no longer increasing, and resources such as land and water are becoming more limited. Crayfish are also cultivated as &lt;a href=\"animal%20feed\"&gt;animal feed&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"poultry%20farm\"&gt;poultry farm&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fish%20farm\"&gt;fish farm&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20edible%20frog\"&gt;bullfrog&lt;/a&gt; farms, or used to add into &lt;a href=\"organic%20fertilizer\"&gt;organic fertilizer&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"P. clarkii\" has also been introduced elsewhere for cultivation, such as &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, where its success is attributable to its ability to colonize disturbed habitats that would be unsuitable for the native crayfish (\"&lt;a href=\"Astacus%20astacus\"&gt;Astacus astacus&lt;/a&gt;\"). \"P. clarkii\" is also marketed by biological supply companies for teaching and research. \"P. clarkii\" also exhibits different color morphs, including white, blue and orange, which are commonly sold in pet stores.\nThe introduction of \"P. clarkii\" has also resulted in economic losses in some regions. In the &lt;a href=\"Baixo%20Mondego\"&gt;Baixo Mondego&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, it caused a decrease in 6.3% of profits in rice fields. However, this was on a wet-seeded field. All negative effects of crawfish can be avoided if adult crawfish are separated from the seed and seedlings.\nAs food.\n\"P. clarkii\" is eaten in China, &lt;a href=\"Cambodia\"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, Europe, Africa, the United States, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. In the United States, crayfish are particularly popular in &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, where the standard culinary terms vary between \"crawfish\", \"crayfish\", \"crawdaddy\" or \"mudbug\", and &lt;a href=\"seafood%20boil\"&gt;crawfish boils&lt;/a&gt; are popular &lt;a href=\"social%20gathering\"&gt;social gathering&lt;/a&gt;s centered around eating the crustaceans. Louisiana crawfish are usually &lt;a href=\"boiling%23In%20cooking\"&gt;boiled&lt;/a&gt; in a large pot with heavy &lt;a href=\"seasoning\"&gt;seasoning&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"salt\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cayenne%20pepper\"&gt;cayenne pepper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lemon\"&gt;lemon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"garlic\"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bay%20leaf\"&gt;bay leaf&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and other items such as &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"corn%20on%20the%20cob\"&gt;corn on the cob&lt;/a&gt;. Many differing methods are used to season the dish, and there are an equal number of opinions on which one is correct.\nIn 1990, Louisiana produced 90% of the crawfish in the world, and consumed 70% locally. However, as early as 2003, Asian &lt;a href=\"fish%20farm\"&gt;fish farm&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"fisheries\"&gt;fisheries&lt;/a&gt; produced more and continued to outpace production in any other part of the world. By 2018, \"P. clarkii\" crawfish production in the Americas represented just 4% of total global \"P. clarkii\" supply. Louisiana crawfish remain in demand for local production and consumption. In 2018, 93% of crawfish farms in the US were located in Louisiana.\nReproduction.\n\"Procambarus clarkii\" normally &lt;a href=\"sexual%20reproduction\"&gt;reproduces sexually&lt;/a&gt;, but research suggests it may also reproduce by &lt;a href=\"parthenogenesis\"&gt;parthenogenesis&lt;/a&gt;."
