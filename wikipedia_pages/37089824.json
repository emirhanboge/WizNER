    "text": "Stony Gorge Dam (National ID # CA10194) is a dam in &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20County%2C%20California\"&gt;Glenn County, California&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe concrete buttress dam was constructed between 1926 and 1928 by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Reclamation\"&gt;United States Bureau of Reclamation&lt;/a&gt;, with a height of 153 feet and 868 feet long at its crest. Structurally it is a relatively early example of an &lt;a href=\"Nils%20F.%20Ambursen\"&gt;Ambursen&lt;/a&gt;-type dam, using contraction joints between all face slabs and buttresses for stability.\nIt impounds &lt;a href=\"Stony%20Creek%20%28Sacramento%20River%29\"&gt;Stony Creek&lt;/a&gt; for irrigation storage and flood control. Hydroelectric power is also produced. Along with the &lt;a href=\"East%20Park%20Dam\"&gt;East Park Dam&lt;/a&gt; about fifteen miles upstream, it is part of the &lt;a href=\"Orland%20Project\"&gt;Orland Project&lt;/a&gt; in the Sacramento valley, one of the Bureau of Reclamation's first generation of water projects. The dam is owned by the Bureau and is operated by the local Orland Unit Water Users` Association.\nThe reservoir it creates, Stony Gorge Reservoir, has a water surface of 1,280 acres, a shoreline of about eighteen miles, and a maximum capacity of 58,500 &lt;a href=\"acre-feet\"&gt;acre-feet&lt;/a&gt;. Recreation includes camping, boating, and fishing (for largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, bluegill, crappie, and catfish). The &lt;a href=\"California%20Office%20of%20Environmental%20Health%20Hazard%20Assessment\"&gt;California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment&lt;/a&gt; (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in the Stony Gorge Dam based on levels of mercury or &lt;a href=\"Polychlorinated%20biphenyl\"&gt;PCBs&lt;/a&gt; found in local species."
