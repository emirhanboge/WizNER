His position of preference was at fullback or in the centres.\nPlaying career.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Rotorua\"&gt;Rotorua&lt;/a&gt;, Papakura toured Australia twice with the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20M%C4%81ori%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New Zealand M\u0101ori&lt;/a&gt; side; in 1908 with the original touring party and again as captain of the 1909 &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20M%C4%81ori%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New Zealand M\u0101ori&lt;/a&gt; side, he also represented &lt;a href=\"Australasia%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Australasia&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1909 Papakura played for &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Plenty%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Rotorua&lt;/a&gt; against an Auckland XIII before playing for &lt;a href=\"Auckland%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Wellington%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1910 Papakura was one of three New Zealanders invited to Sydney to represent Australasia against the &lt;a href=\"1910%20Great%20Britain%20Lions%20tour%20of%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;touring Great Britain Lions&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Asher\"&gt;Albert Asher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Con%20Sullivan\"&gt;Con Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;. Papakura played in both \"Test\" matches at fullback.\nIn 1911 Papakura travelled to England to attend the &lt;a href=\"Festival%20of%20Empire\"&gt;Festival of Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He was recommended to &lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Wolves\"&gt;Warrington&lt;/a&gt; by 1910 Lion &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Shugars\"&gt;Frank Shugars&lt;/a&gt; and 1908 All Gold &lt;a href=\"Massa%20Johnston\"&gt;Massa Johnston&lt;/a&gt; and joined the club in September. He twice appeared for Warrington A but gave the impression of being overweight and unfit.\nPapakura played centre for Warrington's first grade team on 14 October 1911 in a 13\u20138 win over &lt;a href=\"Broughton%20Rangers\"&gt;Broughton Rangers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wilderspool%20Stadium\"&gt;Wilderspool Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. This match was part of the &lt;a href=\"1911%E2%80%9312%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20Union%20season\"&gt;1911\u201312 Northern Rugby Football Union season&lt;/a&gt;. Papakura was New Zealand's first overseas transfer, as he was granted a clearance by the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;New Zealand Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; on 6 October and &lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Wolves\"&gt;Warrington&lt;/a&gt; paid a 20-pound fee that was forwarded to the Rotorua sub-league.\nAfter his one and only first grade appearance, Papakura was again named in the Warrington A side. However, he realised he had failed to secure a place in the Warrington first grade team and so he returned to the Festival of Empire in London."
