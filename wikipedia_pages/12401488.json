    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"geometry\"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt;, a triangle center (or triangle centre) is a point in the plane that is in some sense a &lt;a href=\"Centre%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;center&lt;/a&gt; of a triangle akin to the centers of &lt;a href=\"square%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;squares&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"circle\"&gt;circle&lt;/a&gt;s, that is, a point that is in the middle of the figure by some measure. For example, the &lt;a href=\"centroid\"&gt;centroid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"circumcenter\"&gt;circumcenter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"incenter\"&gt;incenter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orthocenter\"&gt;orthocenter&lt;/a&gt; were familiar to the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20mathematics\"&gt;ancient Greeks&lt;/a&gt;, and can be obtained by simple constructions.\nEach of these classical centers has the property that it is invariant (more precisely &lt;a href=\"equivariant%20map\"&gt;equivariant&lt;/a&gt;) under &lt;a href=\"similarity%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;similarity transformations&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, for any triangle and any similarity transformation (such as a &lt;a href=\"rotation%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;rotation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"reflection%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;reflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dilation%20%28metric%20space%29\"&gt;dilation&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"translation%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;translation&lt;/a&gt;), the center of the transformed triangle is the same point as the transformed center of the original triangle.\nThis invariance is the defining property of a triangle center. It rules out other well-known points such as the &lt;a href=\"Brocard%20points\"&gt;Brocard points&lt;/a&gt; which are not invariant under reflection and so fail to qualify as triangle centers.\nFor an &lt;a href=\"equilateral%20triangle\"&gt;equilateral triangle&lt;/a&gt;, all triangle centers coincide at its centroid. However the triangle centers generally take different positions from each other on all other triangles. The definitions and properties of thousands of triangle centers have been collected in the \"&lt;a href=\"Encyclopedia%20of%20Triangle%20Centers\"&gt;Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHistory.\nEven though the ancient Greeks discovered the classic centers of a triangle they had not formulated any definition of a triangle center. After the ancient Greeks, several special points associated with a triangle like the &lt;a href=\"Fermat%20point\"&gt;Fermat point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nine-point%20center\"&gt;nine-point center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lemoine%20point\"&gt;Lemoine point&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gergonne%20point\"&gt;Gergonne point&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Feuerbach%20point\"&gt;Feuerbach point&lt;/a&gt; were discovered. During the revival of interest in triangle geometry in the 1980s it was noticed that these special points share some general properties that now form the basis for a formal definition of triangle center. , &lt;a href=\"Clark%20Kimberling\"&gt;Clark Kimberling&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Encyclopedia%20of%20Triangle%20Centers\"&gt;Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers&lt;/a&gt;\" contains an annotated list of 39,474 triangle centers.\nFormal definition.\nA &lt;a href=\"function%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;real-valued function&lt;/a&gt; \"f\" of three real variables \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" may have the following properties:\nIf a non-zero \"f\" has both these properties it is called a triangle center function. If \"f\" is a triangle center function and \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" are the side-lengths of a reference triangle then the point whose &lt;a href=\"trilinear%20coordinates\"&gt;trilinear coordinates&lt;/a&gt; are \"f\"(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") : \"f\"(\"b\",\"c\",\"a\") : \"f\"(\"c\",\"a\",\"b\") is called a triangle center.\nThis definition ensures that triangle centers of similar triangles meet the invariance criteria specified above. By convention only the first of the three trilinear coordinates of a triangle center is quoted since the other two are obtained by &lt;a href=\"cyclic%20permutation\"&gt;cyclic permutation&lt;/a&gt; of \"a\", \"b\", \"c\". This process is known as cyclicity.\nEvery triangle center function corresponds to a unique triangle center. This correspondence is not &lt;a href=\"bijective\"&gt;bijective&lt;/a&gt;. Different functions may define the same triangle center. For example, the functions \"f\"1(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") = 1/\"a\" and \"f\"2(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") = \"bc\" both correspond to the centroid.\nTwo triangle center functions define the same triangle center if and only if their ratio is a function symmetric in \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\".\nEven if a triangle center function is well-defined everywhere the same cannot always be said for its associated triangle center. For example, let \"f\"(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\") be 0 if \"a\"/\"b\" and \"a\"/\"c\" are both rational and 1 otherwise. Then for any triangle with integer sides the associated triangle center evaluates to 0:0:0 which is undefined.\nDefault domain.\nIn some cases these functions are not defined on the whole of \u211d3. For example, the trilinears of \"X\"365 are \"a\"1/2 : \"b\"1/2 : \"c\"1/2 so \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" cannot be negative. Furthermore, in order to represent the sides of a triangle they must satisfy the triangle inequality. So, in practice, every function's &lt;a href=\"domain%20of%20a%20function\"&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; is restricted to the region of \u211d3 where \"a\" \u2264 \"b\" + \"c\", \"b\" \u2264 \"c\" + \"a\", and \"c\" \u2264 \"a\" + \"b\". This region T is the domain of all triangles, and it is the default domain for all triangle-based functions.\nOther useful domains.\nThere are various instances where it may be desirable to restrict the analysis to a smaller domain than T. For example:\nDomain symmetry.\nNot every subset D \u2286 T is a viable domain. In order to support the bisymmetry test D must be symmetric about the planes \"b\" = \"c\", \"c\" = \"a\", \"a\" = \"b\". To support cyclicity it must also be invariant under 2\u03c0/3 rotations about the line \"a\" = \"b\" = \"c\". The simplest domain of all is the line (\"t\",\"t\",\"t\") which corresponds to the set of all &lt;a href=\"triangle\"&gt;equilateral&lt;/a&gt; triangles.\nExamples.\nCircumcenter.\nThe point of concurrence of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle ABC is the circumcenter. The trilinear coordinates of the circumcenter are\nLet \"f\"(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") = \"a\"(\"b\"2 + \"c\"2 \u2212 \"a\"2). Then\nso f is a triangle center function. Since the corresponding triangle center has the same trilinears as the circumcenter it follows that the circumcenter is a triangle center.\n1st isogonic center.\nLet A'BC be the equilateral triangle having base BC and vertex A' on the negative side of BC and let AB'C and ABC' be similarly constructed equilateral triangles based on the other two sides of triangle ABC. Then the lines AA', BB' and CC' are concurrent and the point of concurrence is the 1st isogonal center. Its trilinear coordinates are\nExpressing these coordinates in terms of \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\", one can verify that they indeed satisfy the defining properties of the coordinates of a triangle center. Hence the 1st isogonic center is also a triangle center.\nFermat point.\nLet\nThen \"f\" is bisymmetric and homogeneous so it is a triangle center function. Moreover, the corresponding triangle center coincides with the obtuse angled vertex whenever any vertex angle exceeds 2\u03c0/3, and with the 1st isogonic center otherwise. Therefore, this triangle center is none other than the &lt;a href=\"Fermat%20point\"&gt;Fermat point&lt;/a&gt;.\nNon-examples.\nBrocard points.\nThe trilinear coordinates of the first Brocard point are \"c\"/\"b\" : \"a\"/\"c\" : \"b\"/\"a\". These coordinates satisfy the properties of homogeneity and cyclicity but not bisymmetry. So the first Brocard point is not (in general) a triangle center. The second Brocard point has trilinear coordinates \"b\"/\"c\" : \"c\"/\"a\" : \"a\"/\"b\" and similar remarks apply.\nThe first and second Brocard points are one of many bicentric pairs of points, pairs of points defined from a triangle with the property that the pair (but not each individual point) is preserved under similarities of the triangle. Several binary operations, such as midpoint and trilinear product, when applied to the two Brocard points, as well as other bicentric pairs, produce triangle centers.\nPosition vectors.\nTriangle centers can be written as\nwhere formula_3 are position vectors of the center (formula_4) and vertices (formula_5), and formula_6 are scalars that produce the desired center. Some center instances can be seen in the following table, where formula_7 are the lengths of the sides opposite the corresponding vertices, and formula_8 is the area of the triangle, as calculated by &lt;a href=\"Heron%27s%20formula\"&gt;Heron's formula&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome well-known triangle centers.\nRecent triangle centers.\nIn the following table of more recent triangle centers, no specific notations are mentioned for the various points.\nAlso for each center only the first trilinear coordinate f(a,b,c) is specified. The other coordinates can be easily derived using the cyclicity property of trilinear coordinates.\nGeneral classes of triangle centers.\nKimberling center.\nIn honor of Clark Kimberling who created the online encyclopedia of more than 32,000 triangle centers, the triangle centers listed in the encyclopedia are collectively called \"Kimberling centers\".\nPolynomial triangle center.\nA triangle center P is called a \"polynomial triangle center\" if the trilinear coordinates of P can be expressed as polynomials in \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\".\nRegular triangle center.\nA triangle center P is called a \"regular triangle point\" if the trilinear coordinates of P can be expressed as polynomials in \u0394, \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\", where \u0394 is the area of the triangle.\nMajor triangle center.\nA triangle center P is said to be a \"major triangle center\" if the trilinear coordinates of P can be expressed in the form f(A) : f(B) : f(C) where f(X) is a function of the angle X alone and does not depend on the other angles or on the side lengths.\nTranscendental triangle center.\nA triangle center P is called a \"transcendental triangle center\" if P has no trilinear representation using only algebraic functions of a, b and c.\nMiscellaneous.\nIsosceles and equilateral triangles.\nLet \"f\" be a triangle center function. If two sides of a triangle are equal \u00a0(say \"a\" = \"b\")\u00a0 then\nso two components of the associated triangle center are always equal. Therefore, all triangle centers of an isosceles triangle must lie on its line of symmetry. For an equilateral triangle all three components are equal so all centers coincide with the centroid. So, like a circle, an equilateral triangle has a unique center.\nExcenters.\nLet\nThis is readily seen to be a triangle center function and (provided the triangle is scalene) the corresponding triangle center is the excenter opposite to the largest vertex angle. The other two excenters can be picked out by similar functions. However, as indicated above only one of the excenters of an isosceles triangle and none of the excenters of an equilateral triangle can ever be a triangle center.\nBiantisymmetric functions.\nA function \"f\" is biantisymmetric if \"f\"(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") = \u2212\"f\"(\"a\",\"c\",\"b\") for all \"a\",\"b\",\"c\". If such a function is also non-zero and homogeneous it is easily seen that the mapping (a,b,c) \u2192 \"f\"(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\")2 \"f\"(\"b\",\"c\",\"a\") \"f\"(\"c\",\"a\",\"b\") is a triangle center function. The corresponding triangle center is \"f\"(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") : \"f\"(\"b\",\"c\",\"a\") : \"f\"(\"c\",\"a\",\"b\"). On account of this the definition of triangle center function is sometimes taken to include non-zero homogeneous biantisymmetric functions.\nNew centers from old.\nAny triangle center function \"f\" can be normalized by multiplying it by a symmetric function of \"a\",\"b\",\"c\" so that \"n\" = 0. A normalized triangle center function has the same triangle center as the original, and also the stronger property that \"f\"(\"ta\",\"tb\",\"tc\") = \"f\"(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") for all \"t\" &gt; 0 and all (\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"). Together with the zero function, normalized triangle center functions form an &lt;a href=\"algebra%20over%20a%20field\"&gt;algebra&lt;/a&gt; under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This gives an easy way to create new triangle centers. However distinct normalized triangle center functions will often define the same triangle center, for example \"f\" and (\"abc\")\u22121(\"a\"+\"b\"+\"c\")3\"f\" .\nUninteresting centers.\nAssume \"a\",\"b\",\"c\" are real variables and let \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 be any three real constants. Let\nThen \"f\" is a triangle center function and \u03b1 : \u03b2 : \u03b3 is the corresponding triangle center whenever the sides of the reference triangle are labelled so that \"a\" &lt; \"b\" &lt; \"c\". Thus every point is potentially a triangle center. However the vast majority of triangle centers are of little interest, just as most continuous functions are of little interest.\nBarycentric coordinates.\nIf \"f\" is a triangle center function then so is \"af\" and the corresponding triangle center is \"af\"(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") : \"bf\"(\"b\",\"c\",\"a\") : \"cf\"(\"c\",\"a\",\"b\"). Since these are precisely the &lt;a href=\"Barycentric%20coordinate%20system\"&gt;barycentric coordinates&lt;/a&gt; of the triangle center corresponding to \"f\" it follows that triangle centers could equally well have been defined in terms of barycentrics instead of trilinears. In practice it isn't difficult to switch from one coordinate system to the other.\nBinary systems.\nThere are other center pairs besides the Fermat point and the 1st isogonic center. Another system is formed by \"X\"3 and the incenter of the tangential triangle. Consider the triangle center function given by:\nFor the corresponding triangle center there are four distinct possibilities:\nRoutine calculation shows that in every case these trilinears represent the incenter of the tangential triangle. So this point is a triangle center that is a close companion of the circumcenter.\nBisymmetry and invariance.\nReflecting a triangle reverses the order of its sides. In the image the coordinates refer to the (\"c\",\"b\",\"a\") triangle and (using \"|\" as the separator) the reflection of an arbitrary point \u03b1 : \u03b2 : \u03b3 is \u03b3 | \u03b2 | \u03b1. If \"f\" is a triangle center function the reflection of its triangle center is \"f\"(\"c\",\"a\",\"b\") | \"f\"(\"b\",\"c\",\"a\") | \"f\"(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\") which, by bisymmetry, is the same as \"f\"(\"c\",\"b\",\"a\") | \"f\"(\"b\",\"a\",\"c\") | \"f\"(\"a\",\"c\",\"b\"). As this is also the triangle center corresponding to \"f\" relative to the (\"c\",\"b\",\"a\") triangle, bisymmetry ensures that all triangle centers are invariant under reflection. Since rotations and translations may be regarded as double reflections they too must preserve triangle centers. These invariance properties provide justification for the definition.\nAlternative terminology.\nSome other names for dilation are &lt;a href=\"scaling%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;uniform scaling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"scaling%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;isotropic scaling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"homothetic%20transformation\"&gt;homothety&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"homothetic%20transformation\"&gt;homothecy&lt;/a&gt;.\nNon-Euclidean and other geometries.\nThe study of triangle centers traditionally is concerned with &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20geometry\"&gt;Euclidean geometry&lt;/a&gt;, but triangle centers can also be studied in &lt;a href=\"non-Euclidean%20geometry\"&gt;non-Euclidean geometry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Spherical%20geometry\"&gt;Spherical&lt;/a&gt; triangle centers can be defined using &lt;a href=\"spherical%20trigonometry\"&gt;spherical trigonometry&lt;/a&gt;. Triangle centers that have the same form for both Euclidean and &lt;a href=\"hyperbolic%20geometry\"&gt;hyperbolic geometry&lt;/a&gt; can be expressed using &lt;a href=\"gyrotrigonometry\"&gt;gyrotrigonometry&lt;/a&gt;. In non-Euclidean geometry, the assumption that the interior angles of the triangle sum to 180 degrees must be discarded.\nCenters of &lt;a href=\"tetrahedron\"&gt;tetrahedra&lt;/a&gt; or higher-dimensional &lt;a href=\"simplex\"&gt;simplices&lt;/a&gt; can also be defined, by analogy with 2-dimensional triangles.\nSome centers can be extended to polygons with more than three sides. The &lt;a href=\"centroid\"&gt;centroid&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, can be found for any polygon. Some research has been done on the centers of polygons with more than three sides."
