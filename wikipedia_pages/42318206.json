    "text": "The Toggenburg War, also known as the Second War of Villmergen or the Swiss Civil War of 1712, was a &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Swiss%20Confederacy\"&gt;Old Swiss Confederacy&lt;/a&gt; from 12 April to 11 August 1712. The &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt; \"inner cantons\" and the &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20of%20Saint%20Gall\"&gt;Imperial Abbey of Saint Gall&lt;/a&gt; fought the &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; cantons of &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Bern\"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich\"&gt;Z\u00fcrich&lt;/a&gt; as well as the abbatial subjects of &lt;a href=\"Counts%20of%20Toggenburg\"&gt;Toggenburg&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict was a &lt;a href=\"religious%20war\"&gt;religious war&lt;/a&gt;, a war for hegemony in the Confederacy and an uprising of subjects. The war ended in a Protestant victory and upset the balance of political power within the Confederacy.\nBackground.\nThe war was caused by a conflict between the prince-abbot of St Gall, &lt;a href=\"Leodegar%20B%C3%BCrgisser\"&gt;Leodegar B\u00fcrgisser&lt;/a&gt;, and his Protestant subjects in the &lt;a href=\"Counts%20of%20Toggenburg\"&gt;County of Toggenburg&lt;/a&gt;. It had belonged to the Imperial &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20of%20St%20Gall\"&gt;Abbey of St Gall&lt;/a&gt; since 1460 but was simultaneously connected to the Swiss Cantons of &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Glarus\"&gt;Glarus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Schwyz\"&gt;Schwyz&lt;/a&gt; through \"&lt;a href=\"Landrecht%20%28medieval%29\"&gt;Landrecht&lt;/a&gt;\" since 1436. After the &lt;a href=\"Reformation\"&gt;Reformation&lt;/a&gt;, about two thirds of the Toggenburg population were Protestants, but they were not the majority in every municipality. After the transaction of sovereignty to the Imperial Abbey, the Reformed inhabitants of Toggenburg were promised by their Swiss allies of the Cantons of &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich\"&gt;Z\u00fcrich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Bern\"&gt;Bern&lt;/a&gt; and by the prince-abbot that the principle of equal treatment in religious matters would be respected. However, the abbots of St Gall undertook attempts to return Toggenburg to Catholicism in the frame of the &lt;a href=\"Counter-Reformation\"&gt;Counter-Reformation&lt;/a&gt;. In all municipalities, including those that were almost completely Reformed, the position of Catholics was strengthened, and new Catholic churches were built in several towns, which made the common usage of parish churches no longer required.\nIn the 17th century the prince-abbots and their worldly magistrates, the \"Landeshofmeister\", began to organise the abbatial sovereign territories more strictly and to subject them to an at least tentatively modern governance in the frame of the &lt;a href=\"absolute%20monarchy\"&gt;absolutist&lt;/a&gt; practice of the day. That resulted in conflicts by the infringement of the Protestant clergy by the abbatial authorities. In 1663, for example, the abbatial governor of Toggenburg in &lt;a href=\"Lichtensteig\"&gt;Lichtensteig&lt;/a&gt;, Wolfgang Friedrich Schorno, sentenced a vicar, Jeremias Braun, to death because he had allegedly committed &lt;a href=\"blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt; during a Reformed sermon. Only through interference by the Protestant &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Appenzell%20Ausserrhoden\"&gt;Canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden&lt;/a&gt; was Braun's punishment reduced to banishment. Four years later, through the intervention of their protector cantons, the Toggenburgers succeeded in having abbot Gallus Alt (r. 1654\u20131687) remove Schorno from office.\nIn 1695, in the framework of the Counter-Reformation, the seven Catholic cantons of the Confederacy and the prince-abbot of St Gall formed an alliance for the salvation of &lt;a href=\"Catholicism\"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt; against the \"un-Catholic religion\". To strengthen the connections between the Imperial Abbey and Catholic &lt;a href=\"Central%20Switzerland\"&gt;Central Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, Schwyz proposed to Prince-Abbot Leodegar B\u00fcrgisser (r. 1696\u20131717) in 1699 the construction of a new road over the &lt;a href=\"Ricken%20Pass\"&gt;Ricken Pass&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Uznach\"&gt;Uznach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wattwil\"&gt;Wattwil&lt;/a&gt;. That would be strategically and economically important for the Catholic cantons by enabling a rapid movement of Catholic troops to Toggenburg and the Princely Lands in case of war.\nAfter the settlement of the \"Cross War\" with the Reformed &lt;a href=\"St.%20Gallen\"&gt;Imperial City of St. Gallen&lt;/a&gt; in 1697, B\u00fcrgisser ordered the municipality of Wattwil to start constructing the road over the Ricken Pass on the Toggenburg side through &lt;a href=\"socage\"&gt;socage&lt;/a&gt;. The refusal of the Wattwilers to collaborate in building the road, which they regarded as a threat to their religious freedom and as leading to their financial suppression, caused a serious conflict with the prince-abbot, who eventually resorted to incarcerating the highest Toggenburg magistrate, the \"Landweibel\" Josef Germann, in order to break the opposition. Because Germann was a Catholic, the Toggenburgers' complaints were heard by the protector cantons, which began acting on behalf of the Toggenburgers. In that situation, \"Landeshofmeister\" Fidel von Thurn moved B\u00fcrgisser to seek diplomatic ties within the Holy Roman Empire, and a treaty of protection was concluded with Emperor &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Leopold I of Habsburg&lt;/a&gt; in 1702. B\u00fcrgisser even received the investiture as &lt;a href=\"Princes%20of%20the%20Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial Prince&lt;/a&gt; in 1706. Those events threatened to raise the conflict to a European level. Moreover, that constituted a grave breach of the structure and sovereignty of the Confederacy since the Imperial Abbey of St Gall seemed to escape all of the influence of the Confederacy (despite St Gall being a member since 1451) and to enter into the Austrian sphere of influence (the Swiss had fought for centuries to uphold their independence from the Habsburgers). Especially both Appenzells but also Z\u00fcrich could not accept such a turn of affairs. Also, the Princely Lands housed the fourth greatest population within the Confederacy, and they had essential economic importance in eastern Switzerland.\nThe Toggenburgers sought and found allies, mainly in their protector cantons, Schwyz and Glarus, with which they renewed their \"Landrecht\" in 1703 and 1704. Moreover, the Protestant outposts of Z\u00fcrich and Bern were becoming more and more supportive of the Toggenburg cause. In 1707, they presented the prince-abbot with a mediation proposal in which Toggenburg would be granted far-reaching autonomy, but B\u00fcrgisser did not respond. A series of events then began nd would eventually escalate to war.\nEscalation of crisis.\nThe first step towards escalation was made by the Toggenburgers, with the approval of Bern and of Z\u00fcrich, by adopting a design for a constitution on 23 March 1707 at a \"&lt;a href=\"Landsgemeinde\"&gt;Landsgemeinde&lt;/a&gt;\" at Wattwil, which installed an autonomous governance for Toggenburg and maintained the sovereignty of the Imperial Abbey of St Gall over it. The Toggenburgers thus acted upon the example given by Appenzell as a \"Landsgemeinde\" democracy. All abbatial magistrates and the governor were extradited and freedom of religion was promulgated, which obviously threatened the Catholic cantons' interests. The Catholic protector canton of Schwyz defected to the camp of the prince-abbot, and the conflict now assumed a clearly religious character. The Confederacy chose sides along its fault lines of faith for either the prince-abbot of St Gall or the Reformed Toggenburgers. Attempts at mediation by both Imperial and French envoys to the Confederacy failed, and the Reformed cantons urged for settling the conflict before the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession\"&gt;War of the Spanish Succession&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the chance of a foreign intervention.\nThe struggle reached such a peak that the Toggenburgers armed themselves with the support of Z\u00fcrich, and they occupied the abbatial fortresses at &lt;a href=\"L%C3%BCtisburg\"&gt;L\u00fctisburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iberg%20Castle%2C%20St.%20Gallen\"&gt;Iberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jonschwil\"&gt;Schwarzenbach&lt;/a&gt; in 1710. Religious strife was now splitting the Toggenburgers themselves along religious boundaries in the moderate \"&lt;a href=\"Tilia\"&gt;Lime Tree&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Linde\") and the radical \"&lt;a href=\"Pine\"&gt;Pine&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Harte\"). In 1711, several Catholic municipalities once again subjected themselves to the abbot. The \"Pines\" then militarily occupied the municipalities, the abbatial goods and the monasteries of Magdenau and Neu St. Johann with the tacit approval of Bern and Z\u00fcrich. That incident definitively forced the prince-abbot to take military counteractions and spread the crisis throughout Confederacy.\nOn 13 April 1712, Bern and Z\u00fcrich published a manifesto against the prince-abbot of St Gall and so revealed their support for the Toggenburgers. The five Catholic inner cantons of &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Lucerne\"&gt;Lucerne&lt;/a&gt;, Schwyz, &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Uri\"&gt;Uri&lt;/a&gt;, Zug and &lt;a href=\"Unterwalden\"&gt;Unterwalden&lt;/a&gt; published a countermanifesto, and armed themselves for war. Bern and Z\u00fcrich found support with the city of &lt;a href=\"Geneva\"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Neuch%C3%A2tel\"&gt;Principality of Neuch\u00e2tel&lt;/a&gt; as well as its allies in the &lt;a href=\"Prince-Bishopric%20of%20Basel\"&gt;Prince-Bishopric of Basel&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Biel/Bienne\"&gt;Biel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moutier\"&gt;Moutier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"La%20Neuveville\"&gt;La Neuveville&lt;/a&gt;. The five cantons found support with &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9publique%20des%20Sept-Dizains\"&gt;Valais&lt;/a&gt; and in their \"&lt;a href=\"Vogt\"&gt;Vogt&lt;/a&gt;eien\" in &lt;a href=\"Ticino\"&gt;Ticino&lt;/a&gt; as well as in the \"&lt;a href=\"Freie%20%C3%84mter\"&gt;Freie \u00c4mter&lt;/a&gt;\". The remaining cantons stayed neutral, the Catholic cantons of &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Fribourg\"&gt;Fribourg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Solothurn\"&gt;Solothurn&lt;/a&gt; without regard to Bern and France, the Reformed city of St Gallen was surrounded by the abbatial territory and Glarus was internally divided. The &lt;a href=\"Three%20Leagues\"&gt;Three Leagues&lt;/a&gt; mobilised in favour of the Protestant cause because of their alliance with Z\u00fcrich from 1707, but they did not participate in any combat actions.\nCourse of war.\nBecause Bern and Z\u00fcrich had long been preparing for war, they seized the offensive. Bern opened the first war phase on 26 April, when its first troops crossed the river &lt;a href=\"Aar\"&gt;Aar&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stilli\"&gt;Stilli&lt;/a&gt; to support Z\u00fcrich with the occupation of &lt;a href=\"Thurgau\"&gt;Thurgau&lt;/a&gt; and the assault on the abbatial lands. In mid-May, about 3000 Z\u00fcrichers, 2000 Bernese, 2000 Toggenburgers and 1800 Protestant Thurgauers marched into the Princely Lands. They hit upon the abbatial city of &lt;a href=\"Wil\"&gt;Wil&lt;/a&gt;, which fell on 22 May after a short siege. The allies then pushed forward to &lt;a href=\"St.%20Gallen\"&gt;St. Gallen&lt;/a&gt; and occupied the &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20of%20Saint%20Gall\"&gt;Abbey of Saint Gall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vogtei%20Rheintal\"&gt;Vogtei Rheintal&lt;/a&gt;. The abbot fled to &lt;a href=\"Wangen%20im%20Allg%C3%A4u\"&gt;Neuravensburg&lt;/a&gt;, a lordship north of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Constance\"&gt;Lake Constance&lt;/a&gt; that the abbey had acquired in 1699. The five Catholic cantons occupied &lt;a href=\"Rapperswil\"&gt;Rapperswil&lt;/a&gt;, but initially left the abbot without any support. According to the time's &lt;a href=\"laws%20of%20war\"&gt;laws of war&lt;/a&gt;, the abbey and its goods were put an under a military governance, and its chattel and riches were sent to Bern and Z\u00fcrich.\nJust like in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War%20of%20Villmergen\"&gt;First War of Villmergen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Canton%20of%20Aargau\"&gt;Canton of Aargau&lt;/a&gt; became the most important scene of combat. The five cantons occupied the cities of &lt;a href=\"Baden%2C%20Switzerland\"&gt;Baden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mellingen\"&gt;Mellingen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bremgarten%2C%20Aargau\"&gt;Bremgarten&lt;/a&gt; with their strategic &lt;a href=\"ford%20%28crossing%29\"&gt;fords&lt;/a&gt; and thereby threatened to drive a wedge between Z\u00fcrich and Bern. The Bernese immediately launched a counteroffensive under the command of General-Major &lt;a href=\"Jean%20de%20Sacconay\"&gt;Jean de Sacconay&lt;/a&gt;. On 22 May, the forces had clashed in the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Baden\"&gt;County of Baden&lt;/a&gt; near Mellingen. The battle went in favour of the Bernese, who then took the city. On 26 May, they were also victorious at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Fischbach\"&gt;Battle of Fischbach&lt;/a&gt;, and occupied Bremgarten. United with the Z\u00fcrcher troops, the Bernese marched towards Baden, which was forced to surrender on 1 June. The fortress of the Catholic city, the Stein, which had been built after the First War of Villmergen despite protests from the Reformed cantons, was immediately destroyed to symbolise the Protestant victory. Bern and Z\u00fcrich had now successfully prevented the five cantons from splitting them in Aargau. The five cantons moved towards peace negotiations on 3 June, and on 18 July 1712, Z\u00fcrich, Bern, Lucerne and Uri signed a treaty in &lt;a href=\"Aarau\"&gt;Aarau&lt;/a&gt;. It decided that the five cantons would lose their share in the &lt;a href=\"Gemeine%20Herrschaften\"&gt;Gemeine Herrschaften&lt;/a&gt; of the County of Baden and (partially) the Freie \u00c4mter.\nThe second and much bloodier phase of the war was triggered by the \"Landsgemeinden\" of Schwyz, Zug and Unterwalden who, after being influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;papal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nuncio\"&gt;nuncio&lt;/a&gt;, Caraccioli, had rejected the Treaty of Aarau. In Lucerne and Uri, the people also demanded from the government to take up arms once more against the Protestant cantons. On 20 July, the first strike of the forces of the five cantons on the Bernese armed bands occurred at &lt;a href=\"Sins%2C%20Aargau\"&gt;Sins&lt;/a&gt;, which then retreated to join the main guard of Bern at &lt;a href=\"Muri%2C%20Aargau\"&gt;Muri&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sins\"&gt;Battle of Sins&lt;/a&gt;). On 22 July, the Schwyzer and Zuger troops launched a failed attack against the Z\u00fcrcher &lt;a href=\"redoubt\"&gt;redoubt&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Richterswil\"&gt;Richterswil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"H%C3%BCtten%2C%20Switzerland\"&gt;H\u00fctten&lt;/a&gt;. On 25 July, &lt;a href=\"Villmergen\"&gt;Villmergen&lt;/a&gt; once again became the site of the decisive battle. The 8000-strong Bernese companies under the command of &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Frisching%20%28II%29\"&gt;Samuel Frisching&lt;/a&gt;, Niklaus von Diesbach and Jean de Sacconay fought against 12,000 men from Central Switzerland under command of Franz Konrad von Sonnenberg and Ludwig Christian Pfyffer. The long-undecided battle was finally determined by the intervention of a fresh corps from &lt;a href=\"Seengen\"&gt;Seengen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lenzburg\"&gt;Lenzburg&lt;/a&gt; as well as the superior Bernese artillery. During the battle 2,000 Catholics were killed.\nAfter their victory in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Battle%20of%20Villmergen\"&gt;Second Battle of Villmergen&lt;/a&gt;, the Bernese and the Z\u00fcrichers advanced into the Lucernese territory, the land of Zug, across the &lt;a href=\"Br%C3%BCnig%20Pass\"&gt;Br\u00fcnig Pass&lt;/a&gt; to Unterwalden and via Rapperswil to the Linthebene. That made the resistance of the five cantons finally collapse.\nPeace of Aarau or \"Fourth Landfrieden\".\nAt the of 11 August 1712, the Fourth Landfrieden in the history of the Confederacy, Bern and Z\u00fcrich secured their rule over the Gemeine Herrschaften. The political hegemony of the Catholic cantons in the Gemeine Herrschaften since 1531 thus came to an end. That simultaneously meant the restoration of a compromised religious peace within the Old Confederacy.\nThe territorial conditions for peace were somewhat sharpened from those of the first peace treaty:\nZ\u00fcrich's further claims to the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Uznach\"&gt;County of Uznach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B6fe\"&gt;H\u00f6fe&lt;/a&gt; (lost in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Z%C3%BCrich%20War\"&gt;Old Z\u00fcrich War&lt;/a&gt;) and the Vogtei Gaster were not supported by Bern and the other cantons.\nJuridically, the Fourth Landfrieden made the Second Landfrieden of Kappel of 1531, confirmed at the Third Landfrieden in 1656, cease to function. Therefore, the Protestant religion was formally treated equally before the law in the &lt;a href=\"Tagsatzung\"&gt;Tagsatzung&lt;/a&gt; as well as in the governance of the Vogteien, and all conflicts in which both religions were concerned now had parity. In the Landvogteien Thurgau, Baden, Sargans and Rheintal, the Reformed municipalities kept the guarantee of their religious exercise under Z\u00fcrcher sovereignty, and the rights of the Catholics were secured. Instead of mere tolerance, the Protestants now received equal treatment before the law to the traditionally-favoured Catholic religion. A \"Landfriedliche Kommission\", composed of representatives from Z\u00fcrich, Bern, Lucerne and Uri, began to oversee matters of religion.\nThe prince-abbot of &lt;a href=\"Abbey%20of%20Saint%20Gall\"&gt;Saint Gall&lt;/a&gt;, Leodegar B\u00fcrgisser, went into exile with his convent on 29 May to &lt;a href=\"Wangen%20im%20Allg%C3%A4u\"&gt;Neuravensburg Castle&lt;/a&gt;, the residence of a new lordship of St Gall north of &lt;a href=\"Lindau\"&gt;Lindau&lt;/a&gt;. Z\u00fcrich and Bern occupied the Princely Lands and governed it together. Many the monastic movable goods that were left behind in St. Gallen, including parts of the archive and the library, were taken away by them. Because of what he considered to be outrageous damage to the rights of the Imperial Abbey, as well as the danger posed to the Catholic religion in Toggenburg, B\u00fcrgisser obtained the Peace of Rohrschach, which was finally approved on 28 March 1714 after a series of negotiations with Z\u00fcrich and Bern. After the death of B\u00fcrgisser, a new treaty, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Baden%20%281718%29\"&gt;Peace of Baden&lt;/a&gt;, was concluded with his successor, &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20von%20Rudolphi\"&gt;Joseph von Rudolphi&lt;/a&gt; (r. 1717\u20131740) on 16 June 1718. The Imperial Abbey of St Gall was restored, including its rule over Toggenburg, and its autonomy and freedom of religion were confirmed.\nZ\u00fcrich and Bern ratified the Peace on 11 August 1718. The fact that &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Clement%20XI\"&gt;Pope Clement XI&lt;/a&gt; soon denounced the peace in a letter no longer had any effect on the settlement of the conflict. Abbot von Rudolphi returned to the monastery of St Gall on 7 September 1718 after a six-year exile. On 23 March 1719, he managed to retrieve a large part of the library that was removed to Z\u00fcrich at the start of the war. Further objects from the Bernese spoils of war were returned to St Gallen in 1721. However, several valuable pieces of the monastic library of St. Gallen remained in Z\u00fcrich, including manuscripts, paintings, astronomy tools and the Globe of St. Gallen. The conflict on the cultural goods (\"Kulturg\u00fcterstreit\") between Z\u00fcrich and St. Gallen flared up in the 1990s but was finally settled amicably in 2006.\nThe animosity between the Imperial Abbey and Toggenburg increased further until the abolishment of the monastic state in 1798, after two abbatial magistrates had been murdered in 1735 and after a 1739 conference in &lt;a href=\"Frauenfeld\"&gt;Frauenfeld&lt;/a&gt; between the parties had failed to yield any results."
