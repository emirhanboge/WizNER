He was a staff writer for the socialist newsweekly \" &lt;a href=\"The%20Militant\"&gt;The Militant&lt;/a&gt; \" in New York. He wrote about the &lt;a href=\"internal%20resistance%20to%20South%20African%20apartheid\"&gt;internal resistance to South African apartheid&lt;/a&gt; and in 1994 traveled to &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; to attend the Congress of South African Trade Unions convention. In July 2012, Harris was named the Socialist Workers Party nominee for president, with &lt;a href=\"Maura%20DeLuca\"&gt;Maura DeLuca&lt;/a&gt; as the vice presidential nominee.\nLife and career.\nBorn into a &lt;a href=\"working-class\"&gt;working-class&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"African%20American\"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; family in &lt;a href=\"Cleveland\"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ohio\"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, Harris first became politically active in the civil rights movement. With growing protests against racist discrimination, tens of thousands of Black families in the city staged a school strike in the early 1960s, setting up \"Freedom Schools\" to study African-American history.\nOn graduating from high school, Harris attended Cleveland State University, where he was a founding member of the Black Student Union. He organized fellow students into demonstrations opposing the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; as well as actions against racist practices of the college, which then had only a small percentage of Black students. He became a member of the Student Mobilization Committee Against the War in Vietnam and later served on its national staff in Washington, D.C.\nThrough these experiences he joined and later became a leader of the &lt;a href=\"Young%20Socialist%20Alliance\"&gt;Young Socialist Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. He ran for school board in Cleveland on the Socialist Workers ticket in 1969, and soon after joined the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20%28USA%29\"&gt;Socialist Workers Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nA supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20revolution\"&gt;Cuban revolution&lt;/a&gt;, Harris participated in the second Venceremos Brigade to Cuba in 1969 along with hundreds of other youth from the United States. Brigade members cut sugar cane for a couple of months in an expression of solidarity with the efforts by millions of working people in &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; to maximize sugar production. Working alongside Cuban workers and meeting volunteers from Vietnam, Korea, and elsewhere deepened his sense of internationalism.\nHarris moved to &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1970s, and joined in the struggles of the Black community against &lt;a href=\"police%20brutality\"&gt;police brutality&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, a number of young Blacks had been killed by police &lt;a href=\"SWAT\"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; squad units. Later Harris helped mobilize supporters of Black rights in Atlanta to join actions in &lt;a href=\"Boston\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; in the battle for busing and school desegregation in that city.\nIn 1977 Harris moved to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; to join the staff of the National Student Coalition Against Racism, which had helped lead mobilizations for school desegregation. He became a national chairperson of the coalition.\nHarris later worked in a garment factory in &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, as the SWP deepened its industrial base by building units of party members in the garment unions. In Los Angeles he was the chairperson of the SWP in the city.\nHe also participated in brigades to defend the &lt;a href=\"Nicaraguan%20revolution\"&gt;Nicaraguan revolution&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-1980s, and joined a delegation to visit revolutionary &lt;a href=\"Grenada\"&gt;Grenada&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1980s.\nIn 1988 Harris was the Socialist Workers Party candidate in New York for the United States Senate. Harris finished seventh with 11,239 votes.\nHarris lived and worked in &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1990s and was a member of the United Auto Workers there. He helped broaden solidarity with labor struggles such as those of workers on strike against Caterpillar. Harris spent several months in Peoria, Illinois, helping establish a branch of the Socialist Workers Party there in response to the battle by members of the UAW against Caterpillar.\nHarris is a strong critic of the death penalty and he has been active in a struggle against police brutality in &lt;a href=\"Valdosta%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Valdosta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, and has participated in activity with the People's Tribunal, an organization centered on death of Willie James Williams, killed while in police custody in that southern Georgia town."
