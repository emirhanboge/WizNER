    "text": "Lucan ( ; ) is a suburban area located roughly 12\u00a0km west of Dublin city centre on the &lt;a href=\"River%20Liffey\"&gt;River Liffey&lt;/a&gt;. It is located near the Strawberry Beds and Lucan Weir, and at the confluence of the River Griffeen. The area is mostly under the jurisdiction of &lt;a href=\"South%20Dublin%20County%20Council\"&gt;South Dublin County Council&lt;/a&gt; with the exception of the North Lucan areas of Laraghcon, Coldblow and Saint Catherine's Park which are in the jurisdiction of &lt;a href=\"Fingal%20County%20Council\"&gt;Fingal County Council&lt;/a&gt;. Road access to Lucan is from the &lt;a href=\"N4%20road%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;N4&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"M50%20motorway%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;M50 motorway&lt;/a&gt; at Junction 7.\nEtymology.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20language\"&gt;Irish language&lt;/a&gt;, 'leamhach\u00e1n' refers to the &lt;a href=\"Althaea%20officinalis\"&gt;marsh-mallow plant&lt;/a&gt;, used up to modern times in folk medicine (for sprains and chest infections) and sweet manufacture, and so the name could be rendered as \"place of marsh-mallow plants\" or \"land abounding in marsh-mallows.\" The plant grows in the Liffey Valley and surrounds, as recorded in the 1837 \"Ainmleabhar Par\u00f3iste\", reported by Jackson (1914). In 1615, the area was described as 'a marshy place'.. \nThe alternative meaning is derived from the Irish for elm, leamh\u00e1n, and has been more popularised, although both definitions could be equally valid, with both mallows and elms still growing in the Lucan area, and etymological experts unable to definitively choose one meaning over the other, as is evidenced on logainm.ie.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThere is evidence of prehistoric settlement in Lucan as the features that attracted early people such as river access, fishing, well-drained soil and hunting were all around. There is significant prehistoric activity in the Cooldrinagh townland of Lucan, with early Mesolithic flints found in significant quantities, as well as the remains of two small kerbed passage tombs. In the area around Vesey Park there are remains of a hillfort (Knockanardousk \"hill of the high water\") that may have been the house and enclosure of an early lord of Lucan in medieval times. This enclosure also contained a souterrain, excavated in the 18th century by George Petrie and of which, some of the finds are in the National Museum of Ireland. Another notable archaeological site is &lt;a href=\"St%20Finian%27s%20Esker%20church%20and%20graveyard\"&gt;St Finian's Esker church and graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, which is listed by both the National Monuments Service and the &lt;a href=\"National%20Inventory%20of%20Architectural%20Heritage\"&gt;National Inventory of Architectural Heritage&lt;/a&gt;. There are two other medieval churches in Lucan also; the Church of the Blessed Virgin, Lucan village (an enclosed gated graveyard &amp; medieval church site with attached chantry or towerhouse, and the medieval parish church of Aderrig, Lucan, off Tubber Lane.\nSarsfields and Veseys.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Cromwell\"&gt;Oliver Cromwell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cromwellian%20conquest%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;came to Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, Lucan was a village of 120 inhabitants.\nIn 1566, Sir &lt;a href=\"William%20Sarsfield\"&gt;William Sarsfield&lt;/a&gt; acquired &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Manor\"&gt;Lucan Manor&lt;/a&gt;, and the property became closely associated with the Sarsfield family. &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Sarsfield%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Lucan\"&gt;Patrick Sarsfield&lt;/a&gt;, the Irish Jacobite leader, was born in the castle that had occupied the manor grounds and was granted the title Earl of Lucan by &lt;a href=\"James%20II%20of%20England\"&gt;King James II&lt;/a&gt;.\nLucan House was built on the site of Sarsfield's castle in 1772, by the Rt Hon. &lt;a href=\"Agmondisham%20Vesey%20%28died%201785%29\"&gt;Agmondisham Vesey&lt;/a&gt;, who was descended from the Sarsfield family. The circular ground floor dining room is said to have been an inspiration for the &lt;a href=\"Oval%20Office\"&gt;Oval Office&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"White%20House\"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;. The decorative plasterwork was carried out by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Stapleton\"&gt;Michael Stapleton&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years, the house passed out of the Vesey family and, since 1942, has been the residence of the Italian ambassador to Ireland. In the grounds of the house is the spa, the waters of which attracted people to the town in previous times.\nThe influence of the Sarsfield and Vesey families on Lucan is still apparent in the area. For example, the local &lt;a href=\"Gaelic%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;Gaelic Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; club is Lucan Sarsfields and a &lt;a href=\"pub\"&gt;pub&lt;/a&gt; in the village bears the name 'The Vesey Arms'.\nDevelopments.\nThe discovery of a sulphurous &lt;a href=\"thermal%20bath\"&gt;spa&lt;/a&gt; in Lucan in 1758 brought the district into prominence, and it became a destination for weekend parties from Dublin and the surrounding countryside. Much development followed in the vicinity, and by 1795 a ballroom and a later hotel had been erected. Many of the structures in Lucan village were constructed as part of a large redevelopment around 1815. Later, Lucan was a terminus on the combination of tram lines serving Lucan and Leixlip from Dublin city centre.\nTransport and access.\nLucan village is located north of the N4/M4 national primary route to the west and northwest of Ireland. The village is approximately west of the &lt;a href=\"M50%20motorway%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;M50&lt;/a&gt; Dublin ring road. An outer-orbital distributor called the Outer Ring Road, designated as &lt;a href=\"R136%20road\"&gt;R136&lt;/a&gt;, from the N4 (Woodies) interchange to the &lt;a href=\"N81%20road%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;N81&lt;/a&gt; Tallaght Bypass, was completed in 2008.\nLucan is located between two major national/commuter railway lines. The original Lucan North (Leixlip) Station on the north/northwest line, and Lucan South station on the south/southwest line, were closed in 1941 and 1947, respectively. The greenfield development of the Lucan townlands as a major residential area was predicated on the prime location between the motorways and railways. &lt;a href=\"Adamstown%20railway%20station%2C%20Dublin\"&gt;Adamstown railway station&lt;/a&gt; re-opened in 2007 to serve the area; it is located south of Finnstown, Lucan. This station will also service significant further developments planned to the south of &lt;a href=\"Adamstown%2C%20Dublin\"&gt;Adamstown&lt;/a&gt; townlands and the south/southwest commuter line.\nIn 2018 it was announced that the &lt;a href=\"Luas\"&gt;Luas&lt;/a&gt; is planned to be extended to Lucan under the governments 'Project Ireland 2040' transport plan.\n&lt;a href=\"Dublin%20Bus\"&gt;Dublin Bus&lt;/a&gt; provides several bus services to the area. Feeder routes, such as the L52, run through Lucan from &lt;a href=\"Adamstown%20railway%20station%20%28Ireland%29\"&gt;Adamstown&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Blanchardstown\"&gt;Blanchardstown&lt;/a&gt;. Some independent bus operators also serve Lucan.\n&lt;a href=\"Weston%20Airport\"&gt;Weston Airport&lt;/a&gt; is located to the west of Lucan near the Dublin/&lt;a href=\"Kildare\"&gt;Kildare&lt;/a&gt; border. This facility conducts pilot training and serves privately owned light aircraft and helicopters. Its new terminal is located south of the M4 to the east of the Dublin Celbridge Road and Kildare border.\nFeatures.\nKing John's Bridge.\nIt is said that King John's bridge, in Griffeen Park in Lucan, is the oldest surviving bridge in Ireland.\nLucan House.\nLucan House is a seven-bay two-storey over basement &lt;a href=\"Palladian%20architecture\"&gt;Palladian&lt;/a&gt; country villa. Agmonisham Vesey cleared the previous residence and began construction in 1772. The architecture is the work of Vesey and William Chambers, with Michael Stapleton responsible for the plasterwork. The estate passed through the Sarsfield, Vesey and Colthurst families through marriage and also was once the resident of Charles Hugh O'Conor, the third son of &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Owen%20O%27Conor\"&gt;Charles Owen O'Conor&lt;/a&gt; and then, in 1954, it was purchased by the Italian Government for use as the residence of the Italian Ambassador to Ireland. The remainder of the estate land is now Liffey Valley Park.\nOthers.\nAnother notable feature is St Finian's medieval church and graveyard at Esker.\nAmenities.\nThe Griffeen Valley Park runs along the Griffeen River, with some smaller outlying park areas among housing developments to the west. The main area of the park is split by the Lucan Bypass, with Vesey Park on one side and Griffeen Park on the other. A feature of the park is the old woodland in Vesey Park that was retained when the park was formed. This woodland is most extensive along the Griffeen River and contains mature deciduous and coniferous trees. The most important area on the river is the wet woodland containing the most extensive &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bryophyte\"&gt;bryophyte&lt;/a&gt; growth recorded in the five parks surveyed. The woodland also provides the habitat for the protected species \"&lt;a href=\"Hypericum%20hirsutum\"&gt;Hypericum hirsutum&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLucan Library is a part of a network of libraries in South Dublin.\nEducation.\nLucan has a number of schools.
