The APRLC is based at the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;New Zealand Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;'s Auckland headquarters and will focus much of its efforts on developing the sport in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Islands\"&gt;Pacific Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Under the new RLIF constitution agreed in 2010, the APRLC may appoint a delegate to the five-person International Federation executive.\nIn 2011, the Asia-Pacific Rugby League Confederation met in a meeting in Auckland over December 5\u20136.

Amongst many issues that were discussed at the two- day meeting was the application for membership of the federation from India, Philippines, Tahiti, Tokelau and American Samoa that shows the growing popularity of the sport in the region.\nCompetitions.\nPacific Rugby League International.\nThe Pacific Rugby League International is a series of &lt;a href=\"Test%20match%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;rugby league test matches&lt;/a&gt; that have been played during the &lt;a href=\"National%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;National Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;'s annual representative weekend since 2013.\nThey consist of the Melanesian Cup, played between Papua New Guinea and Fiji, and the Polynesian Cup, between Tonga and Samoa.\nOfficial APRL Rankings.\nThe Official Asia Pacific Rugby League Confederation Rankings are calculated on each nation\u2019s performance over the current season and are influenced by a nation\u2019s official RLIF ranking.\nInfluencers of position include:\nRankings as of December 2018"
