That year he played for the Roosters in the first ever &lt;a href=\"ANZAC%20Day%20Cup\"&gt;ANZAC Day Cup&lt;/a&gt; match, kicking a goal. 2002 would be Holbrook's last season at the top level.\nCoaching career.\nHolbrook turned to coaching after retiring from playing. He worked on the coaching staff of the &lt;a href=\"Canterbury%20Bulldogs\"&gt;Canterbury Bulldogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"St%20George-Illawarra%20Dragons\"&gt;St George Illawarra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parramatta%20Eels\"&gt;Parramatta&lt;/a&gt; before joining the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Roosters\"&gt;Sydney Roosters&lt;/a&gt; as right hand man to &lt;a href=\"Trent%20Robinson\"&gt;Trent Robinson&lt;/a&gt;. Holbrook also coached at representative level for &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; (under-21). He was appointed to replace &lt;a href=\"Keiron%20Cunningham\"&gt;Keiron Cunningham&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"head%20coach\"&gt;head coach&lt;/a&gt; of English &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20R.F.C.\"&gt;St. Helens&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn 31 July 2019, it was announced that Holbrook signed a contract to become the new head coach at the Gold Coast for the 2020 season. In the weeks leading up to the announcement, Gold Coast Chairman Dennis Watt said that the next coaching appointment at the Gold Coast would be the club's last stand if results were to not improve under the new coach.\nHe was the St. Helens coach in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Challenge%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2019 Challenge Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; defeat by the &lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Wolves\"&gt;Warrington Wolves&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Super%20League%20XXIV\"&gt;Super League XXIV&lt;/a&gt; season, Holbrook guided St Helens to the &lt;a href=\"League%20Leaders%20Shield\"&gt;League Leaders Shield&lt;/a&gt; after finishing 16 points clear of second placed Wigan. Holbrook then coached St Helens to their 14th championship win after defeating &lt;a href=\"Salford%20Red%20Devils\"&gt;Salford&lt;/a&gt; 23-6 in the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Super%20League%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2019 Super League Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;.\nHolbrook's reign as the Gold Coast head coach got off to a difficult start with the club losing their first three games. In round 4 against the &lt;a href=\"Wests%20Tigers\"&gt;Wests Tigers&lt;/a&gt;, Holbrook guided the club to their first win in 364 days as they won the match 28-23 at &lt;a href=\"Suncorp%20Stadium\"&gt;Suncorp Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. The Gold Coast would go on to finish the &lt;a href=\"2020%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2020 season&lt;/a&gt; in 9th position, a major improvement on the previous year in which they finished last. In the &lt;a href=\"2021%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2021 season&lt;/a&gt;, Holbrook guided the Gold Coast into the finals for the first time since 2016, as the club finished 8th. They were defeated 24-25 in the first week of the finals by the &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Roosters\"&gt;Sydney Roosters&lt;/a&gt;."
