    "text": "\u014chikari Sadayuki (September 24, 1927 \u2013 January 14, 1996, real name Sadayuki Shibata) was a &lt;a href=\"sumo\"&gt;sumo&lt;/a&gt; wrestler and coach from &lt;a href=\"Kamiiso%2C%20Hokkaido\"&gt;Kamiiso, Hokkaido&lt;/a&gt;, Japan. He made his professional debut in January 1944, reaching the top \"&lt;a href=\"makuuchi\"&gt;makuuchi&lt;/a&gt;\" division in 1950. His highest rank was \"&lt;a href=\"komusubi\"&gt;komusubi&lt;/a&gt;.\" He was a runner-up in the May 1956 tournament and earned five \"&lt;a href=\"kinboshi\"&gt;kinboshi&lt;/a&gt;\" or gold stars for defeating \"&lt;a href=\"yokozuna\"&gt;yokozuna&lt;/a&gt;\" during his career. He retired in 1963 and became an &lt;a href=\"toshiyori\"&gt;elder&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Sumo%20Association\"&gt;Japan Sumo Association&lt;/a&gt; under the name \u014cnomatsu Oyakata, working as a coach at &lt;a href=\"Dewanoumi%20stable\"&gt;Dewanoumi stable&lt;/a&gt;. He died in 1996 at the age of 68.\nCareer.\nHis first job after graduating from school was as a driver but he had a large physique which was well suited to sumo, and he was recruited by future \"&lt;a href=\"yokozuna\"&gt;yokozuna&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Chiyonoyama%20Masanobu\"&gt;Chiyonoyama&lt;/a&gt;, who came from nearby &lt;a href=\"Fukushima%2C%20Hokkaido\"&gt;Fukushima&lt;/a&gt;. He joined &lt;a href=\"Dewanoumi%20stable\"&gt;Dewanoumi stable&lt;/a&gt; in January 1944. Originally fighting under his own surname of Shibata, he reached the \"&lt;a href=\"j%C5%ABry%C5%8D\"&gt;j\u016bry\u014d&lt;/a&gt;\" division in January 1949 and adopted the \"&lt;a href=\"shikona\"&gt;shikona&lt;/a&gt;\" of \u014chikari in January 1950. He reached the top \"&lt;a href=\"makuuchi\"&gt;makuuchi&lt;/a&gt;\" division in September of that year. In September 1952 he defeated his first \"yokozuna\", &lt;a href=\"Azumafuji\"&gt;Azumafuji&lt;/a&gt;, although he finished the tournament with only four wins against eleven losses. His best result in a tournament was in May 1956 when he was runner-up to then \"&lt;a href=\"Makuuchi%23%C5%8Czeki\"&gt;\u014dzeki&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Wakanohana%20Kanji%20I\"&gt;Wakanohana Kanji I&lt;/a&gt;, losing to him in a playoff for the \"&lt;a href=\"y%C5%ABsh%C5%8D\"&gt;y\u016bsh\u014d&lt;/a&gt;\" or championship after both wrestlers finished with identical 12\u20133 records. He had fought only his fellow \"&lt;a href=\"maegashira\"&gt;maegashira&lt;/a&gt;\" ranked wrestlers until the final day, when he defeated \"&lt;a href=\"sekiwake\"&gt;sekiwake&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Tsurugamine\"&gt;Tsurugamine&lt;/a&gt;. \u014chikari was awarded the Fighting Spirit \"&lt;a href=\"sansh%C5%8D%20%28sumo%29\"&gt;sansh\u014d&lt;/a&gt;\" or special prize, the only one of his career. He made his debut in the \"&lt;a href=\"sanyaku\"&gt;sanyaku&lt;/a&gt;\" ranks at \"&lt;a href=\"komusubi\"&gt;komusubi&lt;/a&gt;\" in July 1958, but fell just short of a &lt;a href=\"kachi-koshi\"&gt;majority of wins&lt;/a&gt; with a 7\u20138 record. He had one more appearance at \"komusubi\" in November 1958.\nHe was known for his endurance and ability to avoid injury, and on the seventh day of the January 1963 tournament, he became the first wrestler to fight 1000 consecutive matches from his professional debut. He extended this record to 1068 matches, but a ruptured &lt;a href=\"Achilles%20tendon\"&gt;Achilles tendon&lt;/a&gt; in November 1963 ended his streak, and he immediately announced his retirement. 945 of those bouts had been in the top division, which is the seventh longest consecutive run of \"makuuchi\" bouts as of 2017. He had fought in the top division for 13 years and 64 tournaments, with 455 wins against 489 losses, and one draw. He had five gold stars, his \"yokozuna\" wins coming against Azumafuji, &lt;a href=\"Kagamisato\"&gt;Kagamisato&lt;/a&gt;, and Wakanohana I (three times). Despite fighting in 79 career tournaments, he never managed to win a championship in any &lt;a href=\"professional%20sumo%20divisions\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetirement from sumo.\n\u014chikari stayed in sumo as an &lt;a href=\"toshiyori\"&gt;elder&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Sumo%20Association\"&gt;Japan Sumo Association&lt;/a&gt;, working as a coach at Dewanoumi stable under the name of \u014cnomatsu Oyakata until reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65 in September 1992. He sold his \u014cnomatsu stock to former \"sekiwake\" &lt;a href=\"Masurao\"&gt;Masurao&lt;/a&gt;, who went on to found &lt;a href=\"%C5%8Cnomatsu%20stable\"&gt;\u014cnomatsu stable&lt;/a&gt;. He died in January 1996 at the age of 68.\nFighting style.\n\u014chikari liked to push and thrust at his opponents, and was known for the power of his \"tsuppari\", a series of rapid thrusts to the chest. His most common winning \"&lt;a href=\"kimarite\"&gt;kimarite&lt;/a&gt;\" or techniques were \"yori kiri\" (force out), \"utchari\" (ring edge throw) and \"oshi-dashi\" (push out).\nPre-modern top division record.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nModern top division tournament record.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "
