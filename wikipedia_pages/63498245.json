    "text": "Free Korea 21 was a &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;political party in South Korea&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Choi%20Jong-ho\"&gt;Choi Jong-ho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Kyung-se\"&gt;Kim Kyung-se&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe party was founded as the Pro-Ban Unification Party () on 14 March 2016, in order to endorse the-then &lt;a href=\"Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations\"&gt;Secretary-General of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ban%20Ki-moon\"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"2017%20South%20Korean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;upcoming presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"2016%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2016 election&lt;/a&gt;, the party nominated 6 candidates \u2014 2 for constituencies (including the former &lt;a href=\"Cheongju\"&gt;Cheongju&lt;/a&gt; Mayor &lt;a href=\"Han%20Dae-soo%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Han Dae-soo&lt;/a&gt;) and 4 for &lt;a href=\"proportional%20representation\"&gt;proportional representation&lt;/a&gt;s, in which no one was elected.\nFollowing the election defeat, it changed its name to the Pro-Ban Nation Hope Union (&lt;a href=\"Korean%20language\"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt;: \uce5c\ubc18\uad6d\ubbfc\ud76c\ub9dd\uc5f0\ud569) on 29 November. It again changed to the Party for National Hope (&lt;a href=\"Korean%20language\"&gt;Korean&lt;/a&gt;: \uad6d\ubbfc\ud76c\ub9dd\ub2f9) on 31 January 2017 shortly after Ban declared to not seek for the presidential election. On 13 April, it then adopted a new name Economic Patriots (), with electing the President of &lt;a href=\"Haha%20Group\"&gt;Haha Group&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oh%20Young-guk\"&gt;Oh Young-guk&lt;/a&gt; as its presidential candidate. Oh received 6,040 votes (0.01%), making him as the candidate with the fewest votes in the presidential election, as well as the fewest votes since 1948.\nThe party then reverted its former name on 29 October 2019 and again to the Korea Economic Party () on 2 March 2020 as a \"refoundation\". Prior to the &lt;a href=\"2020%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2020 election&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gangnam%20District\"&gt;Gangnam&lt;/a&gt; 3rd MP &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Eun-jae\"&gt;Lee Eun-jae&lt;/a&gt;, joined this party, making the party with a parliamentary representation. Lee, who was elected under the &lt;a href=\"Saenuri%20Party\"&gt;Saenuri&lt;/a&gt; (then &lt;a href=\"United%20Future%20Party\"&gt;United Future Party&lt;/a&gt;) banner &lt;a href=\"2016%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, joined the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Liberal%20Unification%20Party\"&gt;Christian Liberal Unification Party&lt;/a&gt; (CLUP) after lost at &lt;a href=\"preselection\"&gt;preselection&lt;/a&gt;. However, she also withdrew from the CLUP following her elimination due to her &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; identity.\nAfter the party did not gain any seats in the election, sources reported that Lee had already exited from the party.\nThe party was renamed to Free Korea 21 on 14 December 2020, and voted to merge into the new on 6 March 2021.\nPolicies.\nThe party describes itself as \"centre-right\" and critical of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Future%20Party\"&gt;United Future Party&lt;/a&gt;. Originally a pro-&lt;a href=\"Ban%20Ki-moon\"&gt;Ban&lt;/a&gt; party, it has renounced its pro-Ban stance in 2017.\n&lt;a href=\"2016%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2016 election&lt;/a&gt; manifesto.\nFor the 2016 election, the party promised a constitutional amendment, from the 5-year non-renewable presidential system to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;-style 4-year renewable presidential system with reinstating the &lt;a href=\"Vice%20President%20of%20South%20Korea\"&gt;vice presidency&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"2017%20South%20Korean%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2017 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; manifesto.\nFollowing are a part of the manifestos of &lt;a href=\"Oh%20Young-guk\"&gt;Oh Young-guk&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"2020%20South%20Korean%20legislative%20election\"&gt;2020 election manifesto&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the 2020 election, the party promised to overcome the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, adopting it as its \"1st manifesto\"."
