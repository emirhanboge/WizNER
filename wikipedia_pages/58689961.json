    "text": "Eightmile is a &lt;a href=\"Locale%20%28geographic%29\"&gt;locale&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Goshute%20Indian%20Reservation\"&gt;Goshute Indian Reservation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"White%20Pine%20County%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;White Pine County, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. It is located along &lt;a href=\"Spring%20Creek%20%28White%20Pine%20County%2C%20Nevada%29\"&gt;Spring Creek&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEightmile was originally the location of Eight Mile Station, a station on the route of the &lt;a href=\"Pony%20Express\"&gt;Pony Express&lt;/a&gt;. It was later a &lt;a href=\"stagecoach\"&gt;stagecoach&lt;/a&gt; station along the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Overland%20Route\"&gt;Central Overland Route&lt;/a&gt; across the territory and then the state of &lt;a href=\"Nevada\"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. \nOn March 23, 1863, the &lt;a href=\"Goshute\"&gt;Goshutes&lt;/a&gt;, lead by White Horse, burned the station and killed the keeper, which started the Overland or &lt;a href=\"Goshute%23Goshute_War\"&gt;Goshute War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;American Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and during the &lt;a href=\"Snake%20War\"&gt;Snake War&lt;/a&gt;, this station was also frequently occupied by &lt;a href=\"Union%20Army\"&gt;Union Army&lt;/a&gt; troops and later &lt;a href=\"U.%20S.%20Army\"&gt;U. S. Army&lt;/a&gt; regulars from &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ruby\"&gt;Fort Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, it was one of several outposts used to defend and keep open this transportation route that linked the western states and territories to the eastern part of the country before the completion of the construction of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Transcontinental%20Railroad\"&gt;transcontinental railroad&lt;/a&gt; in 1869. \nA sheep ranch was established in the 1900s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lincoln%20Highway\"&gt;Lincoln Highway&lt;/a&gt; passed through Eightmile on its route from &lt;a href=\"Ibapah%2C%20Utah\"&gt;Ibapah, Utah&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ely%2C%20Nevada\"&gt;Ely, Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 1938, the land was bought by the U.S. Government for the use of the Goshutes.\nThe site of the Georgetta Ranch, also referred to as Eightmile, is located nearby.\nToday.\nThe site of Eightmile now appears to be the location of a private residence.
