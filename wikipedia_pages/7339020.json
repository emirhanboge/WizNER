    "text": "Whitestone is a suburban area of &lt;a href=\"Nuneaton\"&gt;Nuneaton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Warwickshire\"&gt;Warwickshire&lt;/a&gt; in central &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is located approximately two miles south-east of Nuneaton town centre. Historically part of &lt;a href=\"Attleborough%2C%20Warwickshire\"&gt;Attleborough&lt;/a&gt;, the area has developed its own identity following extensive housing developments since the 1950s and 1960s. Today, it is generally considered one of Nuneaton's more desirable areas.\nBoundaries.\nWhitestone is bounded approximately by the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Main%20Line\"&gt;West Coast Main Line&lt;/a&gt;, Eastboro Way (A4254), the &lt;a href=\"River%20Anker\"&gt;River Anker&lt;/a&gt;, the borough boundary, and the &lt;a href=\"Ashby-de-la-Zouch%20Canal\"&gt;Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor district (borough) council elections, Whitestone is split between two wards: Whitestone, and Attleborough. Each ward is represented by two councillors, elected by halves.\nFor county council elections, Whitestone is split between three electoral divisions: Nuneaton Whitestone, Nuneaton St Nicolas, and Bulkington. Each electoral division is represented by one county councillor.\nFor postal purposes, that part of Whitestone broadly north of Lutterworth Road has postcodes beginning \"CV11 6\u2013\u2013\", while that part of Whitestone broadly to the south of Lutterworth Road has postcodes beginning \"CV11 4\u2013\u2013\".\nWhitestone, like the rest of Nuneaton, is located within the &lt;a href=\"Historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;historic county&lt;/a&gt; of Warwickshire. It is also part of the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20and%20non-metropolitan%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;administrative county&lt;/a&gt; of Warwickshire (i.e. it is covered by &lt;a href=\"Warwickshire%20County%20Council\"&gt;Warwickshire County Council&lt;/a&gt;) and the Warwickshire &lt;a href=\"ceremonial%20county\"&gt;ceremonial county&lt;/a&gt;.\nPopulation.\nIn the 2011 census, a total of 6,876 people were recorded in Whitestone ward. However, the current ward boundaries exclude that part of Whitestone bounded by Lutterworth Road, Bulkington Lane, the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal and the West Coast Main Line, which falls instead in Attleborough ward. This area (minus The Hollows, Quarry Lane, Mill Close, Rutherford Glen, Loudon Gate, the south side of Lutterworth Road between the West Coast Main Line and the junction with Middelburg Close, plus Coughton Close and part of Upton Way on the Maple Park estate) corresponds to a super output area for statistical purposes, and had a population of 1,498 in the 2011 census. Adding these figures gives a total of 8,374 inhabitants.\nHistory.\nThe area takes its name from \"The White Stone\", a former milestone or guide post. This stone is still visible to travellers at the junction of Lutterworth Road, Bulkington Lane and Golf Drive, in front of the area's main shopping parade.\nUntil well into the 1920s, the area was largely undeveloped, the only notable buildings being farms (such as White Stone Farm, Quarry Farm and Thorn Hill) and a few large houses (such as Hazelwood and Quarry House). Apart from agriculture, the only industry in the area was quarrying: Quarry Farm (and later Quarry Lane) was built next to Attleborough Quarries, while Quarry House, further east, was named after an older quarry.\nIn 1905, Nuneaton Golf Club was established in the area, originally as a nine-hole course. Access was initially via the track that ran from the White Stone, north along a track that also led to farm land. This track later became Golf Drive.\nIn the mid-1920s and 1930s, houses were built along Lutterworth Road, Bulkington Lane and Gipsy Lane, but construction remained limited to minor ribbon development, with the only new roads to be built being Arden Road and Golf Drive.\nThe area was subject to bombing during the Second World War. Bomb craters can still be seen in the fields behind White Stone beyond the Golf Course. The second house along the B4114 from White Stone was subject to a direct hit.\nIn the decades following the Second World War, the area (now known as \"White Stone\", without the &lt;a href=\"definite%20article\"&gt;definite article&lt;/a&gt;) was seen as prime development land, and new housing estates began to be built. The first of these comprised the new streets of Whitestone Road and Stonewell Crescent, built on the site of White Stone Farm. This was shortly followed in the early 1960s by new streets off Golf Drive, named after golf courses and golfing terms. The shopping parade by the crossroads was also built at this time.\nThe late 1960s and the 1970s saw these estates expand (extending as far as Chetwynd Drive and Alderbrook Drive respectively), with new estates \u2013 and schools \u2013 built around Magyar Crescent and Purcell Avenue. For the first time, some of these estates included social housing. The name of the area was also changing: \"Whitestone\" was becoming one word instead of two.\nThe 1980s and 1990s brought major development: Crowhill Road was extended, with new housing developments on both sides. Further east, farmland belonging to Thorn Hill was turned over to housing; the farm's name lives on in Thornhill Drive. The rest of the estate's roads largely continued the golfing theme of existing nearby developments.\nThe most recent developments in Whitestone consist mainly of minor additions to existing estates and the conversion or modification of existing large houses.\nThe area's white stone has been subjected to graffiti by young people on several occasions, but thanks to the residents, it is always painted back to its original colour in line with Whitestone's tradition.\nSchools.\nThe area was originally, in the 1950s through to the early 1970s, served by the Park Avenue primary school in Attleborough. Some children in the Whitestone area also attended Attleborough ( Holy Trinity) Church Infants School, and Caldwell County Junior School until the schools were later closed.\nThe area is now served by two primary schools: Whitestone Infant School (ages 4 to 7) and Chetwynd Junior School (ages 7 to 11). The infant school was originally opened in 1970 as Whitestone Primary School, intended for all 4- to 11-year-olds in the area. However, demand soon outstripped supply, and a second school, Chetwynd, was opened in 1972. At this time, Whitestone Primary became Whitestone First School, for children aged 4 to 8, while Chetwynd Middle School catered for pupils aged 8 to 12. This arrangement of first and middle schools continued until 1996, when all of Warwickshire's schools were brought back into line with the more traditional infant-junior system. Whitestone First thus became Whitestone Infant, and Chetwynd Middle became Chetwynd Junior.\nPart of Chetwynd Junior School burned down in the 1999\u20132000 school year.\nAt secondary level, Whitestone is in the catchment area for &lt;a href=\"George%20Eliot%20Academy\"&gt;George Eliot Academy&lt;/a&gt; (located roughly a mile away in Caldwell). The northern part of Whitestone is also in the catchment area for &lt;a href=\"Etone%20College\"&gt;Etone College&lt;/a&gt; (located in central Nuneaton). Post-16 education is currently provided by &lt;a href=\"King%20Edward%20VI%20College%2C%20Nuneaton\"&gt;King Edward VI College&lt;/a&gt; (in Nuneaton town centre) and &lt;a href=\"North%20Warwickshire%20and%20Hinckley%20College\"&gt;North Warwickshire and Hinckley College&lt;/a&gt; (in eastern Nuneaton).\nCommunity and leisure facilities.\nCommunity facilities in the area include Whitestone Community Centre (adjacent to Whitestone Infant School in Magyar Crescent), Whitestone Clinic (also in Magyar Crescent), and Paul's Land Pavilion, located by the Mill Close entrance to the area's largest recreation ground, Paul's Land (named after the Paul family, the previous owners, who bequeathed the land to the borough council for preservation as a green space).\nPaul's Land is home to a number of playing fields and a large play area. It is linked to the Maple Park estate in southern Attleborough via a cable-stayed footbridge that crosses the &lt;a href=\"West%20Coast%20Main%20Line\"&gt;West Coast Main Line&lt;/a&gt;. This bridge, known as the Maple Park Footbridge, was officially opened on 17 December 2004.\nWhitestone also boasts many play areas, including the sizeable \"Crowhill Park\", located behind Crowhill Shopping Centre.\nThe area has three public houses: the Whitestone, (this was originally called The Hayrick when the Pub was first built) on Meadowside; the Chetwynd Arms, on Chetwynd Drive; and the Crow's Nest, on Crowhill Road, name came from Crow Hill Farm, that was originally on the land where the road and the Public house was later built.\nThere are no purpose built places of worship in Whitestone, although &lt;a href=\"Christadelphians\"&gt;Christadelphians&lt;/a&gt; use the Infant school for weekly meetings. The Anglican parish church for the area is Holy Trinity church in Attleborough. There is also the Baptish Church in The Green, Attleborough.\nShopping facilities.\nWhitestone benefits from three local shopping areas:\nAdditional shopping facilities can be found in nearby Attleborough and &lt;a href=\"Horeston%20Grange%2C%20Warwickshire\"&gt;Horeston Grange&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in Nuneaton town centre.\nStreet names.\nAs with many suburban developments, street names in Whitestone follow a number of themes:"
