    "text": "Trout Lake is a &lt;a href=\"lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt; located in southeast &lt;a href=\"San%20Miguel%20County%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;San Miguel County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colorado\"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Uncompahgre%20National%20Forest\"&gt;Uncompahgre National Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Trout Lake is a 15-minute drive from &lt;a href=\"Ophir%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Ophir&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20State%20Highway%20145\"&gt;Colorado State Highway 145&lt;/a&gt; and a 30-minute drive from &lt;a href=\"Telluride%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Telluride&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nTrout lake was originally explored by American &lt;a href=\"fur\"&gt;fur&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Trapping\"&gt;trappers&lt;/a&gt; and pioneers, who often used the lake as a stopping point for their expeditions. The population of Trout Lake grew after the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Rio%20Grande%20Southern%20Railroad\"&gt;Rio Grande Southern Railroad&lt;/a&gt; and the nearby &lt;a href=\"Ames%20Hydroelectric%20Generating%20Plant\"&gt;Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant&lt;/a&gt; in the 1890s.\nEarly History.\nWhile it is unknown if &lt;a href=\"New%20Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; explorers reached Trout Lake previously, the first record of Trout Lake was taken by an American fur trapping expedition. In the spring of 1831, the St. Louis Fur Company employed a party of 60 men under the command of &lt;a href=\"Colonel\"&gt;Colonel&lt;/a&gt; William G Walton to trap &lt;a href=\"beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt;s and other fur-bearing animals along the headwaters of the &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%20tributary%29\"&gt;San Juan River&lt;/a&gt;. The party spent the summer of 1833 in the valley of the &lt;a href=\"Dolores%20River\"&gt;Rio Dolores&lt;/a&gt; and at Trout Lake before continuing their journey northward.\nOn June 14, 1882, the first post office in Trout Lake was established. At the time is was described as \"a post office, with a small lake near it\" and \"a miner's camp of about a &lt;a href=\"20%20%28number%29\"&gt;score&lt;/a&gt; in number\". Between 1875 and 1885, the area around Trout Lake was often visited by &lt;a href=\"Prospecting\"&gt;prospectors&lt;/a&gt;, but after 10 years of searching, no mines were found near Trout Lake and the post office closed. In the 1885 Colorado Census, Trout Lake was recorded as having a population of 40.\nThe post office was reopened between 1890 and 1892 with the construction of the Rio Grande Southern Railroad in 1891.\nOn June 13, 1905, Trout Lake became a part of the newly created &lt;a href=\"Montezuma%20National%20Forest\"&gt;Montezuma Forest Reserve&lt;/a&gt; with the signing of Proclamation 575 by &lt;a href=\"Theodore%20Roosevelt\"&gt;Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt;. The Montezuma Forest Reserve became a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20National%20Forest\"&gt;National Forest&lt;/a&gt; on March 4, 1907. On July 1, 1947, Montezuma National Forest as split between &lt;a href=\"San%20Juan%20National%20Forest\"&gt;San Juan National Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uncompahgre%20National%20Forest\"&gt;Uncompahgre National Forest&lt;/a&gt;, with Trout Lake becoming part of Uncompahgre National Forest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1910%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;1910 Census&lt;/a&gt; recorded Trout Lake as having a population of 62.\nTrout Lake Dam.\nTrout Lake is a natural lake but was expanded in the 1894 with the construction of the Trout Lake Dam by Telluride Power Co. The purpose of the dam was to create additional reserves for the Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant 3.25 miles downstream. Trout Lake still supplies the Ames Hydroelectric Plant via a &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;-encased outlet pipe that transports water from the Trout Lake Dam's &lt;a href=\"Penstock\"&gt;Penstock&lt;/a&gt; to the Ames Hydroelectric Plant.\n1909 Flood.\nOn September 5, 1909, heavy rains and flooding caused the &lt;a href=\"Dam%20failure\"&gt;failure&lt;/a&gt; of the Trout Lake and Middle Dams. A defect in the Middle Dam's outlet, which permitted water to wash away the &lt;a href=\"soil\"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt; under the dam, likely contributed to the flood. The collapse of the dams released approximately 2,000 &lt;a href=\"Acre-foot\"&gt;Acre-feet&lt;/a&gt; of water downstream, killing &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt;, destroying miles of &lt;a href=\"Track%20%28rail%20transport%29\"&gt;railroad track&lt;/a&gt;, and flooding the nearby towns of &lt;a href=\"Placerville%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Placerville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sawpit%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Sawpit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Newmire%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Newmire&lt;/a&gt;. The Ames Hydroelectric plant remained mostly unharmed. While no one died in the flood, the damage to property was estimated to be $200,000 (approximately $ today).\nIn 1910, the dam was rebuilt with soil and rock instead of the timber used in the previous dam.\nIn 1954, the dam's &lt;a href=\"spillway\"&gt;spillway&lt;/a&gt; was rebuilt to prevent flooding in Trout Lake. The spillway included two &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"siphon\"&gt;siphon&lt;/a&gt;s that discharge water 200 feet downstream from the dam into Lake Fork.\nRio Grande Southern Railroad.\nStarting in 1891, Trout Lake was used as a watering station for the Rio Grande Southern Railroad (RGS), which used the water from the lake to fill its &lt;a href=\"steam%20engine\"&gt;steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s. There were 15 similar stations used by the RGS, all of which were serviced by a large force of men called \"water service\" who maintained the water tanks. While the railroad is no longer in operation, the 50,000 gallon wood watering tank (one of only two left) and a nearby &lt;a href=\"Trestle%20bridge\"&gt;railroad trestle&lt;/a&gt; remain.\nAfter the railroad was abandoned in 1952 the trestle continued to be used as an automobile &lt;a href=\"bridge\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; for several years until a detour was built around it. The trestle was added to the &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20State%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Properties\"&gt;Colorado State Register of Historic Properties&lt;/a&gt; on May 14, 1997. The trestle was stabilized in 2004 with grant funds from the Colorado Historical Fund, &lt;a href=\"Intermodal%20Surface%20Transportation%20Efficiency%20Act\"&gt;Intermodel Surface Transportation Efficiency Act&lt;/a&gt;, San Miguel County, and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Forest%20Service\"&gt;US Forest Service&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecreation.\nTrout Lake had become a popular tourist attraction as early as 1920, especially for fishing. Today, the area around the lake features multiple hiking trails, which in the winter are groomed by the Telluride Nordic Association to be used for &lt;a href=\"cross-country%20skiing\"&gt;cross-country skiing&lt;/a&gt;. The lake is also used for boating and fishing."
