    "text": "The Reform Group was an organisation based in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; that sought to have &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; rejoin the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Nations\"&gt;Commonwealth of Nations&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe group was launched in 1998 as The Reform Movement shortly after the successful referendum ratifying the &lt;a href=\"Good%20Friday%20Agreement\"&gt;Good Friday Agreement&lt;/a&gt; and describing itself as a coalition of \"new unionists for the new millennium\".\nA number of its founders, such as Anne Holliday, had been members of the anti-&lt;a href=\"Irish%20republicanism\"&gt;republican&lt;/a&gt; group, New Consensus. At its launch, the group called for:\nThe group claims to be a voice for \"alternative viewpoints\" of \"Irishmen and Irishwomen who do not fit in the seamless definition\" of &lt;a href=\"Irish%20nationalism\"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Unionism%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;unionist&lt;/a&gt;. It has previously voiced support for &lt;a href=\"Irish%20nationality%20law\"&gt;citizens of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; being given the right to apply for British passports. The group has also expressed views that are critical of the status of the &lt;a href=\"Irish%20language\"&gt;Irish language&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn May 2010, the group launched a book called, \"Ireland and the Commonwealth: Towards Membership\". Speaking at the launch were independent Senator &lt;a href=\"David%20Norris%20%28politician%29\"&gt;David Norris&lt;/a&gt;, writer &lt;a href=\"Mary%20Kenny\"&gt;Mary Kenny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin\"&gt;Trinity College&lt;/a&gt; professor Robert Martin, all of whom stated their support for Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth. It was described in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Phoenix%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;The Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine as a \"ridiculous Unionist ginger group\".\nLogo.\nAt its inception and for some years afterwards, the \"badge\" or logo of The Reform Group was &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Patrick%27s%20Cross\"&gt;Saint Patrick's Cross&lt;/a&gt;, a white flag with a red saltire. This was a controversial choice of symbol as the authenticity of the symbol as one representing Ireland has often been debated."
