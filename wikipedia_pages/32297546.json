    "text": "W. H. Burford and Sons was a soap and candle-making business founded in &lt;a href=\"Adelaide%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; in 1840 by &lt;a href=\"%23W.%20H.%20Burford\"&gt;William Henville Burford&lt;/a&gt; (1807\u20131895), an English butcher who arrived in the new colony in 1838. It was one of the earliest soapmakers in Australia, and up to the 1960s when it closed, the oldest. \nIn 1878 he took his two sons Benjamin and William into partnership as W. H. Burford &amp; Sons.\nIts expansion, (in the latter part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century, at the hands of son &lt;a href=\"%23William%20Burford\"&gt;William Burford&lt;/a&gt;) accompanied by a number of takeovers, made it the dominant soap manufacturer in &lt;a href=\"South%20Australia\"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Australia\"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Its founders were noted public figures in the young city of Adelaide.\nW. H. Burford and Sons was in turn taken over by J. Kitchen &amp; Sons, who became Lever &amp; Kitchen, part of the British &lt;a href=\"Lever%20Brothers\"&gt;Lever Brothers&lt;/a&gt; empire, which in 1930 merged with Dutch &lt;a href=\"Margarine%20Unie\"&gt;Margarine Unie&lt;/a&gt; to form the multi-national &lt;a href=\"Unilever\"&gt;Unilever&lt;/a&gt;.\nW. H. Burford and Sons.\nFactories.\nW. H. Burford's first factory was on the corner of &lt;a href=\"Grenfell%20Street\"&gt;Grenfell Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"East%20Terrace\"&gt;East Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, later the site of an Adelaide Electric Supply Company's building, (AESC became the &lt;a href=\"Electricity%20Trust%20of%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Electricity Trust of S.A.&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 ETSA \u2013 in 1946) and in 1989, the &lt;a href=\"Tandanya%20National%20Aboriginal%20Cultural%20Institute\"&gt;Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitially it was little more than a tin shed in a vacant field. During one of the recessions that faced the colony, Burford was forced to sell the land then lease it back to keep the business running.\nThe second factory, opened in 1900 at &lt;a href=\"Sturt%20Street%2C%20Adelaide\"&gt;Sturt Street&lt;/a&gt;, previously owned by competitor &lt;a href=\"Tidmarsh%20%26amp%3B%20Co\"&gt;Tidmarsh &amp; Co&lt;/a&gt;, occupied 4 acres of floor space ( 19,000 sq yards / 16,000m2 / 1.6 hectares ) and employed over 200 men. Its most salient feature was the brick chimney \u2013 152\u00a0ft 4in (46.5m) in height and a flue diameter of 4\u00a0ft (1.2m), and still standing (though no longer used). The boiler room housed four boilers, one of which was 27\u00a0ft long and 7\u00a0ft 6in in diameter (8.2m x 2.3m) and the largest to have been built in South Australia. The still-room had six large stills: four for distillation of stearine and two for glycerine. The building was organised so that manufacture started on the top floor and progressed by chutes or conveyors to the second floor for wrapping and packaging, thence to the ground floor, all with a minimum of handling. The smell emanating from the Sturt Street factory, despite installation of deep drainage, was the source of much complaint from neighbours.\nIn 1887 Burfords took over Apollo Soap Ltd of Adam Street, &lt;a href=\"Hindmarsh%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Hindmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. The factory, which continued to be called the \"Apollo Works\", was the site of work mostly peripheral to the core business of soap and candle making, such as rendering down of animal fats and grinding of corn, bone, starch and blacking, and the manufacture of wooden packing crates. In 1888 they took over &lt;a href=\"Frearson%27s%20Printing%20Works\"&gt;Frearson's Printing Works&lt;/a&gt;, whose factory was also on Adam Street. These premises were destroyed by fire on 25 December 1907.\nIn February 1919 the Sturt Street premises were destroyed by fire. Rather than rebuild in the city, a new factory was set up in &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Creek%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Dry Creek&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Creek%20railway%20station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt; where there had once been a smelter. Manufacture resumed in 1922. Much was made at the time of a model suburb to serve employees of the soap works and the nearby abattoirs. \"Burford Garden Suburb\" as it was named, was designed by W. J. Earle, the town planner behind Cadbury's model town at &lt;a href=\"Claremont%2C%20Tasmania\"&gt;Claremont, Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;. The Dry Creek lots were snapped up immediately they were offered for sale. The greater part of the Sturt Street property was sold around the same time. \"Burford Gardens\" as the name of a suburb has since vanished, though its streets remain: Flame Avenue, Gum Avenue, Wattle Avenue, Grevillea Avenue and Bushwood Avenue, all in what is now known as &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Creek%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Dry Creek&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Western Australia, the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Park%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Victoria Park&lt;/a&gt; factory opened in 1897. After taking over the Swan Soap and Candle Company Ltd., the &lt;a href=\"North%20Fremantle%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Rocky Bay&lt;/a&gt; factory opened in 1899, and &lt;a href=\"Kalgoorlie%2C%20Western%20Australia\"&gt;Kalgoorlie&lt;/a&gt; factories opened later.\nIn 1924 Burford's merged with rival soap makers &lt;a href=\"J.%20Kitchen%20and%20Sons\"&gt;J. Kitchen and Sons&lt;/a&gt; of Melbourne and &lt;a href=\"Lever%20Brothers\"&gt;Lever Brothers&lt;/a&gt; of Sydney as Australian Producers Co-Partnership Ltd. In 1928 Kitchen's Fremantle factory was destroyed by fire, and Burford's was able to make up the shortfall by manufacturing to Kitchen specifications, the product being wrapped, packed and distributed by the Kitchen factory. This opened the way for further rationalization, and by 1937 all Burford factories were under the control of J Kitchen &amp; Sons.\nIn 1932 Associated Producers became Associated Enterprises Pty Ltd, renamed Lever Associated Enterprises Pty Ltd in 1944. By 1948 production by Burfords in Adelaide had been wound down and in 1957 Unilever (Australia) bought out W. H. Burford &amp; Sons.\nProducts.\nProducts manufactured during the history of W. H. Burford &amp; Sons include:\nPublic nuisance.\nWhen Burford's soapworks and Peacock's tannery were founded on Grenfell Street, there were no residences nearby; nothing but virgin bushland. But as the population grew nearby (and to some extent attracted by the businesses), the number of complaints about smells grew until, in 1866, a case was brought against Burford in the Supreme Court. The jury appeared to be convinced by the argument that the complainants had chosen to build knowing what trades were carried on there so had no right to complain, and found for the defendant.\nThe Council had other plans. In 1919 it offered Burfords \u00a312,000 as an incentive to move out of the city altogether. The offer was turned down, so the Council amended the Health Act to prohibit such industries, then the fire engulfed the factory and the Dry Creek facility moved a big step towards reality.\nFires.\nIn 1885 a fire which started in a timber yard in Grenfell Street and East Terrace spread to Burford's factory, which was destroyed. This led to the establishment of a factory in Sturt Street.\nOn 25 December 1907, the factory on Adam Street, Hindmarsh, \"The Apollo Works\" was destroyed in one of the greatest fires in Adelaide's history, along with neighbouring skin dealers Wilcox and Co. in Torrens Street (now named River Street). The nearby factory of &lt;a href=\"G.%20H.%20Michell%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;G. H. Michell &amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt; and David Reid's tannery suffered lesser damage.\nIn 1919 the works bounded by &lt;a href=\"Sturt%20Street%2C%20Adelaide\"&gt;Sturt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilbert%20Street%2C%20Adelaide\"&gt;Gilbert&lt;/a&gt;, Norman and Russell Streets in the &lt;a href=\"Adelaide%20city%20centre\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed by fire and a new factory was then set up in Dry Creek; the office area was rebuilt and the rest sold.\nCompetitors.\nOther early soap and candle makers of South Australia included:\nThe other major Australian soap manufacturer was &lt;a href=\"J.%20Kitchen%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;J. Kitchen &amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt; of Melbourne, which dominated the Eastern States much as Burfords had dominated South and Western Australia. &lt;a href=\"Lever%20Brothers\"&gt;Lever Brothers&lt;/a&gt; of England had a &lt;a href=\"Lever%20Brothers%20Factory\"&gt;factory in Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and one in &lt;a href=\"Wellington%2C%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;Wellington, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nMerger and Acquisition.\nIn 1924, &lt;a href=\"Lever%20and%20Kitchen\"&gt;Lever and Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; and W. H. Burford &amp; Sons formed Australian Producers Partnership Pty Ltd. Burford ordinary shares were held by Lever and Kitchen; around 1962 after a few more takeovers the parent company was renamed Unilever. The Burford's factory was still running profitably in the mid-50s, and the factory at Dry Creek was still listed as such in 1962; the office at 83 Sturt Street still bore the Burford's name, alongside that of its nominal owner J. Kitchen &amp; Sons Ltd, Rexona Pty. Ltd. and Lever Brothers Pty. Ltd.\nW. H. Burford.\nWilliam Henville Burford (24 January 1807 \u2013 23 October 1895) was an apprenticed butcher with some experience as a tallow merchant and chandler in Cannon Street, &lt;a href=\"St%20George%20in%20the%20East%20%28parish%29\"&gt;St George's East&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"East%20End%20of%20London\"&gt;East End of London&lt;/a&gt;. In 1838 he emigrated to &lt;a href=\"South%20Australia\"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; for his health's sake with his wife and three daughters on the \"&lt;a href=\"Pestonjee%20Bomanjee\"&gt;Pestonjee Bomanjee&lt;/a&gt;\", arriving at &lt;a href=\"Glenelg%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Glenelg&lt;/a&gt; on 11 October. Initially he found work as a painter and glazier, and soon had one of the larger businesses in the Colony. In 1840, when a recession had made those trades unprofitable, he was able to start a soap and candle factory in 134 (154?) &lt;a href=\"Grenfell%20Street\"&gt;Grenfell Street&lt;/a&gt;. The business failed several times, but revived with the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Burra%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Burra&lt;/a&gt; copper mine in 1848, then the &lt;a href=\"Moonta%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Moonta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wallaroo%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Wallaroo&lt;/a&gt; mines around 1863.\nBurford was an alderman of the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide Town Council&lt;/a&gt; for 1840 and 1841. During his second term he earned the nickname of \"ninepenny dips\" for his proposal to more than double the council rates to that figure (and \"dip\" being a form of candle), and was reviled for proposing other stringencies. He was not elected the following year and was vindicated when the Council collapsed, bankrupt.\nBurford was elected to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Australian%20House%20of%20Assembly\"&gt;South Australian House of Assembly&lt;/a&gt; for the seat of &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20district%20of%20City%20of%20Adelaide\"&gt;City of Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; in 1857. He was prominent in debates and a strong supporter of &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Richard%20Torrens\"&gt;Robert Torrens&lt;/a&gt;' Real Property Act, but resigned in 1859.\nBurford was a devout churchgoer, worshipping with the Independent Baptists, then Scotch Baptists and finally the Unley Church of Christ.\nFamily of W. H. Burford.\nHe married three times:\nWilliam Burford.\nWilliam Burford (11 December 1845 \u2013 6 March 1925) was born in a cottage at 154 &lt;a href=\"Grenfell%20Street\"&gt;Grenfell Street&lt;/a&gt;, Adelaide, adjacent to his father's factory.\nHe was educated first at the &lt;a href=\"Pulteney%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;Church of England Grammar School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pulteney%20Street\"&gt;Pulteney Street&lt;/a&gt; then, with brother Benjamin, at J. L. Young's &lt;a href=\"Adelaide%20Educational%20Institution\"&gt;Adelaide Educational Institution&lt;/a&gt; in Stephens Place. Leaving school, he joined his father's business. In 1878 he and his brother Benjamin were taken into partnership, but after about eight years the latter withdrew from the enterprise.\nIn 1868, while on holiday in New Zealand, William visited a soap works which boiled soap using steam rather than fire. On his return to Adelaide he wasted no time in getting his father to adopt this method.\nHe was chairman of directors of the company from 1895 until his death, in his &lt;a href=\"Belair%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Belair&lt;/a&gt; home (on Sheoak Road) called \"&lt;a href=\"Birralee%2C%20Belair\"&gt;Birralee&lt;/a&gt;\". When he took the reins, the company had 6 employees; at the time of his death it had grown to over 500 spread over several factories, though his time as a hands-on manager had long since passed.\nPhilanthropy and Public Works.\nWilliam Burford's many offices, services and philanthropic deeds included:\nMrs Burford was a prominent member of the Wattle Blossom League (later &lt;a href=\"Wattle%20Day%23Wattle%20Day%20League%2C%201909\"&gt;Wattle Day League&lt;/a&gt;) and held an annual function at \"Monomeith\", the Burfords' summer residence at &lt;a href=\"Ashton%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Ashton&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecreation.\nHe was a life member of the South Australian Cricket Association and a member of the East Adelaide Cricket Club.\nIn his later years he was a serious bowls player.\nHe was a keen yachtsman, was a member of the Holdfast Bay Sailing Club (and Vice-commodore in 1896) and with son F. R. Burford owned the yacht Empress 1894 \u2013 1896. \nFamily of William Burford.\nWilliam married Mary Richardson (c. 1845 \u2013 12 May 1921) on 11 November 1867. She died at their home \"&lt;a href=\"Birralee%2C%20Glenelg\"&gt;Birralee&lt;/a&gt;\", in &lt;a href=\"Glenelg%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Glenelg&lt;/a&gt;. Their 53 year marriage produced eleven children, of whom five sons and four daughters survived childhood. All five sons went into the family business:\nAfter the death of his wife, he sold the Glenelg mansion \"Birralee\" on Albert Terrace and Seawall, in September 1921, and the summer home \"Monomeith\", on 3 acres (1.2 ha) at &lt;a href=\"Ashton%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Ashton, South Australia&lt;/a&gt;, in 1922. By 1921, both the Monomeith and Birralee Glenelg properties were mostly used by Mrs. Burford and her daughters.\nHe died on 6 March 1925 at his \"&lt;a href=\"Birralee%2C%20Belair\"&gt;Birralee, Belair&lt;/a&gt;\" home on Sheoak Road in &lt;a href=\"Belair%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Belair&lt;/a&gt;, located next to the &lt;a href=\"Belair%20National%20Park\"&gt;National Park&lt;/a&gt; and overlooking the Adelaide Plains. He had suffered a heart attack a year previously. At some stage he had married the widow of &lt;a href=\"William%20Finlayson%20%28churchman%29\"&gt;William Finlayson jun.&lt;/a&gt; and she nursed him in his final years."
