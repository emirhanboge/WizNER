    "text": "Altenbeken station is in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Altenbeken\"&gt;Altenbeken&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Paderborn%20%28district%29\"&gt;Paderborn district&lt;/a&gt; of the German state of &lt;a href=\"North%20Rhine-Westphalia\"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;. The station has a great importance as a hub for local and long-distance transport due to its location on the &lt;a href=\"Hamm%E2%80%93Warburg%20railway\"&gt;line from the Ruhr area to Warburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kassel\"&gt;Kassel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to &lt;a href=\"Altenbeken%E2%80%93Kreiensen%20railway\"&gt;Holzminden\u2013Kreiensen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hanover%E2%80%93Altenbeken%20railway\"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herford%E2%80%93Himmighausen%20railway\"&gt;Herford&lt;/a&gt;. Its importance has increased recently because of the lack of &lt;a href=\"Intercity-Express\"&gt;Intercity-Express&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Intercity%20%28Deutsche%20Bahn%29\"&gt;Intercity&lt;/a&gt; services on the so-called &lt;a href=\"Mid-Germany%20Railway\"&gt;Mid-Germany Railway&lt;/a&gt; ().\nHistory.\nThe railway from &lt;a href=\"Paderborn%20Hauptbahnhof\"&gt;Paderborn&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Warburg%20station\"&gt;Warburg&lt;/a&gt; opened in 1853, originally without a station at Altenbeken. The station was built with the branch line to Holzminden opened on 1 October 1864, the station building was opened in 1865. During the time of the &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Reichsbahn\"&gt;Deutsche Reichsbahn&lt;/a&gt; (1920\u20131949), the station was part of the territory of the Directorate of Kassel (\"Reichsbahndirektion Kassel\") and under &lt;a href=\"Deutsche%20Bundesbahn\"&gt;Deutsche Bundesbahn&lt;/a&gt; it continued to be under the Directorate of &lt;a href=\"Kassel\"&gt;Kassel&lt;/a&gt;, until its dissolution at the end of 1974, after which it was administered from &lt;a href=\"Hanover\"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the 1980s the line to Herford has only been served by regional services. Former semi-fast and express services from &lt;a href=\"Osnabr%C3%BCck%20Hauptbahnhof\"&gt;Osnabr\u00fcck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bielefeld%20Hauptbahnhof\"&gt;Bielefeld&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bremen%20Hauptbahnhof\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt; via Altenbeken, &lt;a href=\"Kassel%20Hauptbahnhof\"&gt;Kassel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bebra%20station\"&gt;Bebra&lt;/a&gt; and to southern Germany were eliminated one by one. The last service to be closed was the \"Der Cherusker\" service to Osnabr\u00fcck and &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Bentheim%20station\"&gt;Bad Bentheim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Intercity-Express\"&gt;Intercity-Express&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intercity%20%28Deutsche%20Bahn%29\"&gt;Intercity&lt;/a&gt; services can now only be accessed indirectly through &lt;a href=\"Herford%20railway%20station\"&gt;Herford&lt;/a&gt;. Through trains run to Bielefeld via &lt;a href=\"Lage%2C%20North%20Rhine-Westphalia\"&gt;Lage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bielefeld%E2%80%93Hamelin%20railway\"&gt;Bega Valley Railway&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Leopoldsh%C3%B6he\"&gt;Oerlinghausen&lt;/a&gt;, where there is a connection to &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BCnster%20Hauptbahnhof\"&gt;M\u00fcnster&lt;/a&gt;. The route to Hanover has been served since 2000 by the &lt;a href=\"Hanover%20S-Bahn\"&gt;Hanover S-Bahn&lt;/a&gt;. Intercity trains stopped at Altenbeken station until December 2007, including occasional &lt;a href=\"ICE%20T\"&gt;ICE T&lt;/a&gt; trains. Since the timetable change in December 2010, daily pairs of Intercity-Express trains run to and from Dresden and Munich.\nStation layout.\nThe station has eleven platform tracks with a length of 140 metres to 403 metres and platform heights varying between 38 and 76 centimetres. The opening of platform 200 on 30 May 1958 to allow a connection between the lines from Hanover or Herford towards Warburg and Kassel means that were now platforms of three sides of a triangle. The track on the third side is now only used by freight.\nAltenbeken station is an \"Inselbahnhof\" (\"island station\", with the station building surrounded by tracks), which means that the reception building is only accessible through underpasses. A total of four lines leave the station in an easterly direction and the only westerly route runs over the &lt;a href=\"Altenbeken%20Viaduct\"&gt;Altenbeken Viaduct&lt;/a&gt; towards Paderborn. Because of these characteristics of the railways, the station is also known as the \"F\u00fcnffingerbahnhof\" (five fingers station).\nElectrification.\nOn 11 December 1970, the electrification of the Hamm\u2013Kassel line completed and the first electric locomotive was able to enter Altenbeken station. On 21 May 1971, electrification was completed on the Altenbeken\u2013Hanover line. Except for the line to H\u00f6xter and Kreiensen are all lines are now electrified.\nCurrent services.\nOn the line, some long-distance passenger services stop on &lt;a href=\"Intercity%20%28Deutsche%20Bahn%29\"&gt;Intercity&lt;/a&gt; services, including one daily service on line 50 from &lt;a href=\"D%C3%BCsseldorf%20Hauptbahnhof\"&gt;D\u00fcsseldorf&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dresden%20Hauptbahnhof\"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt;). The station is served by several &lt;a href=\"Regional-Express\"&gt;Regional-Express&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Regionalbahn\"&gt;Regionalbahn&lt;/a&gt; lines. It is also a stop on &lt;a href=\"Hanover%20S-Bahn\"&gt;Hanover S-Bahn&lt;/a&gt; line S 5 to &lt;a href=\"Hamelin%20station\"&gt;Hamelin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hannover%20Hbf\"&gt;Hanover&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hannover-Langenhagen%20Airport\"&gt;Hanover Airport&lt;/a&gt; every hour (every two hours on Sundays)."
