    "text": "Hirsch Schwartzberg (Szwarcberg, Schwarzberg) (28 October 1907, in &lt;a href=\"Vilna\"&gt;Vilna&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 17 October 1987 in &lt;a href=\"Ashdod\"&gt;Ashdod&lt;/a&gt;) was a &lt;a href=\"Jewish\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; leader of &lt;a href=\"Holocaust%20survivors\"&gt;Holocaust survivors&lt;/a&gt; () under the &lt;a href=\"Allied%20occupation%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;American occupation of Berlin&lt;/a&gt;.\nSchwartzberg was president of the Central Committee of Jewish Displaced Persons in Berlin. He controlled activities of two adjoining &lt;a href=\"Displaced%20persons%20camp\"&gt;displaced-person camps&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin, in &lt;a href=\"D%C3%BCppel%20%28Berlin%29\"&gt;D\u00fcppel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mariendorf\"&gt;Mariendorf&lt;/a&gt;. As a witness remembers, in the years of his leadership there was no riots or violence in the camps.\nAll of Schwartzberg's family were killed in the &lt;a href=\"Holocaust\"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 except himself, his wife and son. Together they survived the &lt;a href=\"Vilna%20Ghetto\"&gt;Vilna Ghetto&lt;/a&gt;. A couple weeks before its final liquidation in September 1943, they \u2014 along with a few hundred other Jews from the ghetto \u2014 escaped by obtaining permits to work in &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Plagge\"&gt;Karl Plagge&lt;/a&gt;'s hastily expanded &lt;a href=\"HKP%20562%20forced%20labor%20camp\"&gt;HKP 562 forced labor camp&lt;/a&gt; on Suba\u010diaus Street in &lt;a href=\"Vilnius\"&gt;Vilnius&lt;/a&gt;. HKP562 served a few workshops spread out through Vilnius; one of its main tasks was retrofitting small trucks to use wood as fuel. At the workshop to which Schwartzberg was assigned, he served as the workers\u2019 spokesman.\nThe survival rate at HKP562 was higher than in the liquidated Vilna ghetto. Yet Plagge and his more benevolent officers could not avert the final outcome: Most of the Jewish workers of the HKP were murdered \u2014 mainly by Ukrainian and Estonian &lt;a href=\"Schutzstaffel\"&gt;SS&lt;/a&gt; forces \u2014 in July 1944, before Soviet troops occupied Vilna/Vilnius. Schwartzberg, with wife and son, survived by switching to new hiding places during the night \u2014 as their previous hideouts got discovered, and pursuing forces murdered Jews they caught. Most of those hideouts were makeshift and often overcrowded, increasing their likelihood of discovery.\nFor the Schwartzbergs and other surviving Jews, the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20occupation%20of%20the%20Baltic%20states%20%281944%29\"&gt;Soviet occupation&lt;/a&gt; was a liberation. Yet Vilnius/Vilna, before the German invasion, was populated mainly by &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Vilnius\"&gt;ethnic Poles and Jews&lt;/a&gt;. After the Nazi genocide in Lithuania, Vilna Jewish society \u2014 and the community that had nurtured Schwartzberg \u2014 no longer existed. So, after the Schwartzbergs recuperated \u2014 and as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; proceeded westward towards Berlin \u2014 Schwartzberg and his family also left Vilnius and moved west. They arrived in &lt;a href=\"Szczecin\"&gt;Szczecin&lt;/a&gt;, Poland, and then \u2014 three weeks after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;German capitulation&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 in Berlin.\nAnother calculation in Schwartzberg's decision to leave his hometown of Vilna was to avoid the Soviets\u2019 &lt;a href=\"Population%20transfer%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;forced migration east&lt;/a&gt; of many people \u2014 including surviving Jews \u2014 from Lithuania. On arrival in East Berlin, Schwartzberg lied about his place of birth, claiming he and his family were from Lodz, Poland. &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Stalin&lt;/a&gt; was, at that time, deporting people from Lithuania and the other &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20states\"&gt;Baltic states&lt;/a&gt;, often shipping them east into the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn February 1949 Schwartzberg, and his wife and son, immigrated to the United States."
