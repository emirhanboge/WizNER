    "text": "Philipp von Mansfeld (1589 - 8 April 1657), was Graf von (&lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; of) &lt;a href=\"Mansfeld\"&gt;Mansfeld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20castles%20in%20Saxony-Anhalt%23Mansfeld-S.C3.BCdharz%20District\"&gt;Vorderort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bornstedt%2C%20Mansfeld-S%C3%BCdharz\"&gt;Bornstedt&lt;/a&gt; who commanded troops during the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt;. He first fought on the side of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Empire\"&gt;Swedish Empire&lt;/a&gt; under his second-cousin, was captured, changed allegiance and raised a navy for General &lt;a href=\"Albrecht%20von%20Wallenstein\"&gt;Albrecht von Wallenstein&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he commanded troops as \"&lt;a href=\"Feldmarschall\"&gt;Feldmarschall&lt;/a&gt;\" of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamily.\nMansfeld was born in 1589, the son of Bruno, Count of Mansfeld-Vorderort and his wife, Christine of &lt;a href=\"Barby%2C%20Germany\"&gt;Barby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M%C3%BChlingen\"&gt;M\u00fchlingen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1611 Mansfeld married &lt;a href=\"Maria%20von%20Mansfeld-Hinterort\"&gt;Maria von Mansfeld-Hinterort&lt;/a&gt; and they had six children:\nUpon her death, Mansfeld married, in 1630, &lt;a href=\"Margaretha%20Catharine%20von%20Lobkowicz\"&gt;Margaretha Catharine von Lobkowicz&lt;/a&gt; but had no further children.\nMilitary career.\nMansfeld first served under &lt;a href=\"Ernst%20von%20Mansfeld\"&gt;Ernst von Mansfeld&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Empire\"&gt;Swedish Empire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt;. The two were, in fact, second-cousins; Mansfeld's grandfather and Ernst von Mansfeld's father were half-brothers. Ernst von Mansfeld had originally fought on the side of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20V%2C%20Archduke%20of%20Austria\"&gt;Leopold V, Archduke of Austria&lt;/a&gt;, but conflicts with the Archduke had driven him to join the side of the &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCapture and abjuration.\nIn 1622, Ernst von Mansfeld's troops faced the army of &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Tserclaes%2C%20Count%20of%20Tilly\"&gt;Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mingolsheim\"&gt;Battle of Mingolsheim&lt;/a&gt;. They were victorious but during Tilly's final push, Mansfeld's troops were overwhelmed and he was captured along with a number of other senior officers. Questioned about his relationship to his commanding officer, Mansfeld suggested he was a true \"Graf von Mansfeld\"; \"ich bin der rechte, vnd der ander nicht\" (\"I am the true, the other is not\") - a reference to his second-cousin's illegitimate birth.\nGeneral &lt;a href=\"Albrecht%20von%20Wallenstein\"&gt;Albrecht von Wallenstein&lt;/a&gt; inquired as to whether he might be persuaded to join (or, in fact, rejoin) the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Mansfeld agreed and joined Wallenstein's forces.\nMansfeld's navy at Wismar.\nIn 1628, Wallenstein sent Mansfeld to raise a &lt;a href=\"navy\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Wismar\"&gt;Wismar&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The local &lt;a href=\"mayor\"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; was persuaded to give Mansfeld some abandoned buildings, part of an old &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; and an empty yard. Over the following year he \"brought together, in fact, a not insignificant naval force\" consisting of various vessels either bought from local merchants and converted, or captured and reconfigured. The force included a number of \"&lt;a href=\"Galleon\"&gt;Orlogsschiff&lt;/a&gt;\", including two built from scratch and two captured &lt;a href=\"Denmark%E2%80%93Norway\"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scow\"&gt;sailing barge&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Danes tried to halt Mansfeld's progress by attacking Wismar in April 1628 and again in June, each time blocking the &lt;a href=\"harbour\"&gt;harbour&lt;/a&gt; entrance with barges and bombarding the town with &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; fire from larger ships. The Danes terrorized the town by sending smaller armed &lt;a href=\"sloop\"&gt;sloop&lt;/a&gt;s into the harbour to capture fishermen. Mansfeld's compound suffered significant damage but his tiny makeshift \"navy\" was able to drive the Danes back out to sea. The Danes moved to nearby &lt;a href=\"Poel\"&gt;Poel&lt;/a&gt; where they captured several \"Wismarsche\" fishermen, took them to Denmark, and imprisoned them in &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; until the town paid a ransom of 100 &lt;a href=\"guilders\"&gt;guilders&lt;/a&gt; per captive.\nThe Danes continued to &lt;a href=\"blockade\"&gt;blockade&lt;/a&gt; the harbour while Mansfeld continues to build his navy. In 1629, 7 warships from &lt;a href=\"Danzig\"&gt;Danzig&lt;/a&gt;, send by the Polish king &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%20Vasa\"&gt;Sigismund Vasa&lt;/a&gt; joined the force. On 22 May 1629, the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20L%C3%BCbeck\"&gt;Treaty of L\u00fcbeck&lt;/a&gt; was signed, effectively bringing an end to Danish involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Thirty%20Years%27%20War\"&gt;Thirty Years' War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Treaty of L\u00fcbeck.\nFor a brief period toward the end of 1629, Mansfeld and &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Lauenburg\"&gt;Julius Henry, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg&lt;/a&gt; were briefly sent to relieve a failed general near &lt;a href=\"Klaip%C4%97da\"&gt;Memel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Treaty of L\u00fcbeck and the withdrawal of the Danes, Mansfeld's navy continued to defend the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; coastline of &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Empire\"&gt;Swedish Empire&lt;/a&gt; but fighting was limited to small &lt;a href=\"skirmish\"&gt;skirmish&lt;/a&gt;es. In 1630, King &lt;a href=\"Gustavus%20Adolphus%20of%20Sweden\"&gt;Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden&lt;/a&gt; landed in &lt;a href=\"Pomerania\"&gt;Pomerania&lt;/a&gt;, to the East of Mansfeld's forces in Wismar. The Duchy of Pomerania capitulated and &lt;a href=\"Bogislaw%20XIV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Pomerania\"&gt;Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania&lt;/a&gt;, and his councillors negotiated the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Stettin%20%281630%29\"&gt;Treaty of Stettin&lt;/a&gt; with Adolphus.\nIn 1632, Mansfeld was appointed \"&lt;a href=\"General\"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Infantry\"&gt;Infantry&lt;/a&gt;\". The following year, on 16 November 1633 Mansfeld was appointed, \"&lt;a href=\"Feldmarschall\"&gt;Feldmarschall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Empire\"&gt;Holy Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;\".\nConflict with the Count Palatine of Neuburg.\nIn 1634, Mansfeld commanded troops in smaller conflicts around &lt;a href=\"Borken%2C%20Hesse\"&gt;Borken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geseke%23Division%20of%20the%20town\"&gt;B\u00f6nninghausen&lt;/a&gt; and his troops caused trouble for villagers and townfolk in &lt;a href=\"Neutrality%20%28international%20relations%29\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; regions loyal to &lt;a href=\"Wolfgang%20William%2C%20Count%20Palatine%20of%20Neuburg\"&gt;Wolfgang William, Count Palatine of Neuburg&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Windeck\"&gt;Windeck&lt;/a&gt;, 3000 &lt;a href=\"cavalry\"&gt;cavalry&lt;/a&gt; troops looted various &lt;a href=\"parish\"&gt;parish&lt;/a&gt;es and moved on to &lt;a href=\"Overath\"&gt;Overath&lt;/a&gt;, where the church was robbed. Mansfeld's &lt;a href=\"generals\"&gt;generals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"colonel\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;s used the opportunity to \"fill their pockets at the expense of the country\". The Count feared Mansfeld's troops would eventually make it to &lt;a href=\"D%C3%BCsseldorf\"&gt;D\u00fcsseldorf&lt;/a&gt; and increased the &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; there.\nThe soldiers were, though, soon brought under control and the Count demanded &lt;a href=\"restitution\"&gt;restitution&lt;/a&gt; for damage caused to &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; and property. Mansfeld paid a portion of the claim and records to suggest he remained held in high regard for his skills as a &lt;a href=\"commanding%20officer\"&gt;commanding officer&lt;/a&gt;. But the damage, in the broader sense, had already been done and in October, Mansfeld was relieved of his command and ordered to pay further compensation.\n&lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Archduke Ferdinand of Austria&lt;/a&gt; (who later became &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;), who had been appointed \"Supreme Commander\" at the death of &lt;a href=\"Albrecht%20von%20Wallenstein\"&gt;General Wallenstein&lt;/a&gt;, was also given command of Mansfeld's troops as \"&lt;a href=\"Feldmarschall\"&gt;Feldmarschall&lt;/a&gt;\".\nConflict in Driedorf and Herborn.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20N%C3%B6rdlingen%20%281634%29\"&gt;Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen&lt;/a&gt; to the South, Mansfeld was given command of a smaller force which he took, in 1635, to &lt;a href=\"Braunfels\"&gt;Braunfels&lt;/a&gt; and then to &lt;a href=\"Driedorf\"&gt;Driedorf&lt;/a&gt; to counterattacks and looting by &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; troops and &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;. After Driedorf was looted and set alight, Mansfeld marched toward &lt;a href=\"Herborn%20%28Hesse%29\"&gt;Herborn&lt;/a&gt; where there was heavy fighting. Sporadic fighting continued through the first half of 1635 and damage to nearby towns was extensive. Eventually, commanders from either side were convinced to come together in &lt;a href=\"Mainz\"&gt;Mainz&lt;/a&gt; and negotiate a form of regional truce."
