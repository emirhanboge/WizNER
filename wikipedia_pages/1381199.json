    "title": "Agistment",
    "text": "Agistment originally referred specifically to the proceeds of pasturage in the &lt;a href=\"royal%20forest\"&gt;king's forests&lt;/a&gt;. To agist is, in &lt;a href=\"English%20law\"&gt;English law&lt;/a&gt;, to take &lt;a href=\"cattle\"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Grazing\"&gt;graze&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for payment (derived from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; \"giste\", \"gite\", a \"lying place\").\nHistory.\nAgistment originally referred specifically to the proceeds of pasturage in the &lt;a href=\"royal%20forest\"&gt;king's forests&lt;/a&gt; in England, but now means either:\nAgistment involves a contract of &lt;a href=\"bailment\"&gt;bailment&lt;/a&gt;, and the bailee must take reasonable care of the animals entrusted to him; he is responsible for damages and injury which result from ordinary casualties, if it be proved that such might have been prevented by the exercise of great care. There is no &lt;a href=\"lien\"&gt;lien&lt;/a&gt; on the cattle for the price of the agistment unless by express agreement. Under the &lt;a href=\"Agricultural%20Holdings%20Act\"&gt;Agricultural Holdings Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1883, agisted cattle cannot be distrained on for rent if there be other sufficient distress to be found, and if such other distress be not found, and the cattle be distrained, the owner may redeem them on paying the price of their agistment. The &lt;a href=\"tithe\"&gt;tithe&lt;/a&gt; of agistment or \"tithe of cattle and other produce of grass lands\" was formally abolished in Great Britain by the &lt;a href=\"Act%20of%20Union%201707\"&gt;Act of Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1707, on a motion submitted with a view to defeat that measure.\nAgistment tithe continued in Ireland, but was opposed by landlords who had converted holdings from tillage to pasture, who secured a 1736 resolution of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Ireland\"&gt;House of Commons of Ireland&lt;/a&gt; opposing the levying of agistment tithe on \"dry and barren cattle\". Although this was not enshrined in statute law until just before the &lt;a href=\"Acts%20of%20Union%201800\"&gt;Acts of Union 1800&lt;/a&gt;, nevertheless it provided sufficient cover for widespread refusal to pay.\nCurrent usage.\nEngland (New Forest).\nIn &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, agisters were formerly the officers of the forest empowered to collect the agistment. They have been re-established in the &lt;a href=\"New%20Forest\"&gt;New Forest&lt;/a&gt; to carry out the daily duties of administering the forest.\nAustralia and New Zealand.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, agistment is commonly used during times of &lt;a href=\"drought\"&gt;drought&lt;/a&gt;; livestock from a drought-affected property can be agisted on a drought-free property elsewhere in the country. The livestock may travel to the alternate pasture by truck or by travelling &lt;a href=\"stock%20route\"&gt;stock route&lt;/a&gt;. Agistment can also refer, in both Australia and New Zealand, to places such as farms, paddocks, or studs where the owners of horses can pay to have their animals looked after and allowed to graze ('full agistment') or where grazing only is offered ('part agistment').\nUnited States and Canada.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the term agister is used in &lt;a href=\"raw%20milk\"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt; herdshare agreements to refer to the person hired to provide agistment services for owners of the herd animals. In the &lt;a href=\"Western%20United%20States\"&gt;Western United States&lt;/a&gt;, agisters are landholders who offer pasturage services, or who seek to enforce agistment lien commitments.\nReferences.\nAttribution:"
