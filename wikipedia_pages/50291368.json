    "text": "V\u00e4in\u00f6 Lahja Richard Valve (until 1915 V\u00e4h\u00e4tupa; 28 December 1895 \u2014 11 March 1995) was a &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"general\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"navy\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; commander and the last living member of the &lt;a href=\"27th%20J%C3%A4ger%20Battalion%20%28Finland%29\"&gt;Royal Prussian J\u00e4gerbattalion 27&lt;/a&gt; formed from Finnish volunteers.\nValve studied seven years in &lt;a href=\"Lappeenranta\"&gt;Lappeenranta&lt;/a&gt; and after completing middle school, he worked in &lt;a href=\"apprenticeship\"&gt;apprenticeship&lt;/a&gt;, until went to study &lt;a href=\"electrical%20engineering\"&gt;electrical engineering&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tampere\"&gt;Tampere&lt;/a&gt;. In 1916 he joined to &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4ger%20Movement\"&gt;J\u00e4ger Movement&lt;/a&gt; and travelled secretly to &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. He was in military training until 1918 until he travelled as an &lt;a href=\"Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;officer&lt;/a&gt; to newly independent Finland and fought in the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Finnish Civil War&lt;/a&gt; together with other j\u00e4gers.\nIn the 1920s Valve's military career was in upswing; he commanded first the &lt;a href=\"coastal%20artillery\"&gt;coastal artillery&lt;/a&gt; and in 1933 he became commander of the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Navy\"&gt;Finnish Navy&lt;/a&gt;, including the coastal artillery. Valve took part at developing &lt;a href=\"Finnish%E2%80%93Estonian%20defence%20cooperation\"&gt;military co-operation with Estonia&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; interrupted Valve's masterminded navy development plan, which had been approved just shortly before. During the Second World War the coastal artillery performed well in the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20War\"&gt;Winter War&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Continuation%20War\"&gt;Continuation War&lt;/a&gt; Valve organised navy co-operation with the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt;. After Finland made &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Armistice\"&gt;armistice with the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, the navy took part in &lt;a href=\"Lapland%20War\"&gt;Lapland War&lt;/a&gt; in which the objective was driving off German troops from the country.\nValve was &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28Finland%29\"&gt;defence minister of Finland&lt;/a&gt; in 1944\u20131945. He left army in 1946 as &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20general\"&gt;lieutenant general&lt;/a&gt; and made career in &lt;a href=\"banking\"&gt;banking&lt;/a&gt;. He took actively part in j\u00e4ger association activities.\nValve was promoted &lt;a href=\"general\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt; in 1992. He died in 1995 as the last Finnish j\u00e4ger.\nEarly life and studies.\nValve was born in &lt;a href=\"Lappeenranta\"&gt;Lappeenranta&lt;/a&gt; as V\u00e4in\u00f6 V\u00e4h\u00e4tupa. His parents were from &lt;a href=\"Finland%20Proper\"&gt;Finland Proper&lt;/a&gt;; the father, Matti V\u00e4h\u00e4tupa, worked as &lt;a href=\"farrier\"&gt;farrier&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Dragoon%20Regiment\"&gt;Finnish Dragoon Regiment&lt;/a&gt; and later he started his own business in &lt;a href=\"Lappee\"&gt;Lappee&lt;/a&gt;. V\u00e4in\u00f6 had six siblings. He studied in Lappeenranta coeducational middle school until 17-year old. He was interested in &lt;a href=\"electrical%20engineering\"&gt;electrical engineering&lt;/a&gt; and went for apprenticeship first to &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Oy\"&gt;Helsinki City Electricity Works&lt;/a&gt;, then to &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russian%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Russian Navy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Katajanokka\"&gt;Katajanokka&lt;/a&gt; and after that to &lt;a href=\"VR%20Group\"&gt;State Railways&lt;/a&gt; repair depot. In 1914 V\u00e4in\u00f6 V\u00e4h\u00e4tupa started electrical engineering studies in Tampere Technical School.\nJ\u00e4ger Movement.\nIn 1915 V\u00e4h\u00e4tupa changed his surname to \"Valve\", \"awake\". He interrupted his studies in late winter 1916, when he decided secretly to join to the &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A4ger%20Movement\"&gt;J\u00e4ger Movement&lt;/a&gt;, following example of many of his fellow students. He skied over frozen &lt;a href=\"Kvarken\"&gt;Kvarken&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and arrived in &lt;a href=\"Lockstedt\"&gt;Lockstedt&lt;/a&gt; camp in &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; on 1 May. The &lt;a href=\"27th%20J%C3%A4ger%20Battalion%20%28Finland%29\"&gt;Royal Prussian J\u00e4gerbattalion 27&lt;/a&gt; was formed from the Finnish volunteers. Valve was ordered to join &lt;a href=\"artillery\"&gt;artillery&lt;/a&gt; and in November he was sent to east front at &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Riga\"&gt;Gulf of Riga&lt;/a&gt;. Valve served in &lt;a href=\"howitzer\"&gt;howitzer&lt;/a&gt; battery of the battalion in 1916\u20131917. Following the service at the front, he was sent to &lt;a href=\"Liep%C4%81ja\"&gt;Libau&lt;/a&gt; for training and promoted to &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, he returned to the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Declaration%20of%20Independence\"&gt;newly independent Finland&lt;/a&gt; in February 1918.\nMilitary career in Finland.\nReturn and early career.\nThe returned j\u00e4gers took part in the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Finnish Civil War&lt;/a&gt; on the white side, and Valve fought in battles of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Tampere\"&gt;Tampere&lt;/a&gt; and Viipuri as an artillery officer. In spring 1918, after the war was over, Valve started as trainer in newly founded Finnish Artillery School in Lappeenranta. In the same autumn he became commander of Heavy Artillery Battalion, from spring 1919 Heavy Artillery regiment, based in the same town. Still in 1918 Valve was promoted &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, in 1919 he became &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20colonel\"&gt;lieutenant colonel&lt;/a&gt; in 1923.\nRise to Navy commander.\nIn 1924 Valve started as commander of &lt;a href=\"coastal%20artillery\"&gt;coastal artillery&lt;/a&gt; and in the following year, just at the age of 29, he was promoted &lt;a href=\"colonel\"&gt;colonel&lt;/a&gt;; in the 1920s Valve was the fastest promoted member of the J\u00e4ger Movement. One reason for the quickly progressed career was the military leadership's aim to push aside the older officers served in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russian%20Army\"&gt;Imperial Russian Army&lt;/a&gt;, and place the j\u00e4gers in the key positions. During 1925\u20131926 went through Commander Course in General Staff College.\nThe coastal artillery and navy were put together into one organisation under the same military staff in 1927, and Valve became commander of the entire coastal defence of Finland. He completed &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Warfare\"&gt;Naval Warfare&lt;/a&gt; Course in 1929. Valve's title was changed Navy Commander in 1933, and the then 37-year old Valve became &lt;a href=\"major%20general\"&gt;major general&lt;/a&gt;. The coastal artillery was further enlarged and modernised both at sea coast and &lt;a href=\"lake%20Ladoga\"&gt;lake Ladoga&lt;/a&gt;. Valve took part at developing &lt;a href=\"Finnish%E2%80%93Estonian%20defence%20co-operation\"&gt;Finnish\u2013Estonian defence co-operation&lt;/a&gt;. One part of it was a &lt;a href=\"crisis%20plan\"&gt;crisis plan&lt;/a&gt; of closing &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Finland\"&gt;Gulf of Finland&lt;/a&gt; in artillery co-operation between the two countries, and as a part of this, &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A4kiluoto\"&gt;M\u00e4kiluoto&lt;/a&gt; island close to &lt;a href=\"Porkkala\"&gt;Porkkala&lt;/a&gt; peninsula was fortified.\nA large part of the Finnish fleet were vessels inherited from the Imperial Russian Navy and in the early 1930s the Navy was strengthened by five submarines and two &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20coastal%20defence%20ship%20V%C3%A4in%C3%A4m%C3%B6inen\"&gt;V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen-class&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"coastal%20defence%20ship\"&gt;coastal defence ship&lt;/a&gt;s; the decision about purchasing the two heavily armed floating fortresses was made without listening to V\u00e4in\u00f6 Valve. After this, the Navy got just a narrow slice of the annual budget of national defence. The head of the Defence Committee, &lt;a href=\"Field%20marshal%20%28Finland%29\"&gt;Field Marshal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C.G.E.%20Mannerheim\"&gt;C.G.E. Mannerheim&lt;/a&gt; was not familiar with naval warfare. The situation changed in 1938 when Valve became member in the committee; new plans for the Navy development were in place in 1939, but they could not be executed before outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20War\"&gt;Winter War&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond World War.\nDuring the Second World War Valve led the Navy. &lt;a href=\"Naval%20warfare%20in%20the%20Winter%20War\"&gt;Naval activity in the Winter War&lt;/a&gt; was low; the coastal artillery fought efficiently against the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Navy\"&gt;Soviet Navy&lt;/a&gt; and ground forces in &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Viipuri\"&gt;Gulf of Viipuri&lt;/a&gt;. After the war ended to bitter &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Peace%20Treaty\"&gt;Moscow Peace Treaty&lt;/a&gt; in 1940, Finland established close relationship with &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. During the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Continuation%20War\"&gt;Continuation War&lt;/a&gt; the Finnish Navy co-operated with &lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt;, managing to block the Soviet Navy into the eastern bottom of Gulf of Finland. Valve was in a key role, because he had created good relations with the Kriegsmarine already before the war broke out. After signing the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Armistice\"&gt;Moscow Armistice&lt;/a&gt; with the Soviet Union in autumn 1944, Finland was obligated to drive off the German army from its area. Valve experienced the situation personally hard to bear; his troops took the first military action against Germany in &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Tanne%20Ost\"&gt;Operation Tanne Ost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suursaari\"&gt;Suursaari&lt;/a&gt; island. This was the starting point of the &lt;a href=\"Lapland%20War\"&gt;Lapland War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefence minister.\nDefence minister &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20Walden\"&gt;Rudolf Walden&lt;/a&gt; fell ill in late 1944. In the same December president Mannerheim called Valve, whom he greatly respected, to take the place of Walden in &lt;a href=\"Paasikivi%20II%20Cabinet\"&gt;J.K. Paasikivi's cabinet&lt;/a&gt;. Apolitical Valve, however, could not readjust himself to work efficiently in the government. After the end of his term in April 1945 he led &lt;a href=\"demining\"&gt;demining&lt;/a&gt; of sea areas. He left the army as &lt;a href=\"lieutenant%20general\"&gt;lieutenant general&lt;/a&gt; in spring 1946.\nLater career.\nValve started a new career in banking sector. He worked as bank manager for &lt;a href=\"Kansallis-Osake-Pankki\"&gt;KOP&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Saarij%C3%A4rvi\"&gt;Saarij\u00e4rvi&lt;/a&gt; 1950\u20131954 and in &lt;a href=\"Pit%C3%A4j%C3%A4nm%C3%A4ki\"&gt;Pit\u00e4j\u00e4nm\u00e4ki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; in 1954\u20131959.\nValve was promoted General in 1992. He died in 1995 as the last member of the J\u00e4gerbattalion 27.\nA street in Lappeenranta was named \"V\u00e4in\u00f6 Valveen katu\" and in 2007 city of Helsinki named a park after him.\nFamily.\nDuring 1921\u20131948 Valve was married to Margareta (Greta) Helena &lt;a href=\"n%C3%A9e\"&gt;n\u00e9e&lt;/a&gt; Corn\u00e9r (1884\u20131968). The couple had three children: Mirja Margareta (b. 1922), Helena Mathilda (married H\u00e4nninen; 1925\u20132005) and Matti Sakari (1928\u20131975). In 1949 Valve married Aili Aune n\u00e9e Haahti (1907\u20131996)."
