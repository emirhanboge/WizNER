    "text": "Hynerpeton ( ) is an extinct &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of early four-limbed &lt;a href=\"vertebrate\"&gt;vertebrate&lt;/a&gt; that lived in the rivers and ponds of &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Late%20Devonian\"&gt;Late Devonian&lt;/a&gt; period, around 365 to 363 million years ago. The only known species of \"Hynerpeton\" is H. bassetti, named after the describer's grandfather, city planner &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Bassett\"&gt;Edward Bassett&lt;/a&gt;. \"Hynerpeton\" is known for being the first Devonian four-limbed vertebrate discovered in the United States, as well as possibly being one of the first to have lost &lt;a href=\"Fish%20gill\"&gt;internal (fish-like) gills&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis genus is known from few remains discovered at the Red Hill fossil site in &lt;a href=\"Hyner%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Hyner, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. The most notable fossil is a large endochondral &lt;a href=\"shoulder%20girdle\"&gt;shoulder girdle&lt;/a&gt; consisting of the &lt;a href=\"cleithrum\"&gt;cleithrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"scapula\"&gt;scapula&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"coracoid\"&gt;coracoid&lt;/a&gt; (but not the &lt;a href=\"interclavicle\"&gt;interclavicle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"clavicle\"&gt;clavicle&lt;/a&gt;s), all connected into one shoulder bone. The inner surface of this shoulder bone possesses an array of depressions believed to have been attachment points for a unique set of powerful muscles around the chest. This may have given \"Hynerpeton\" improved mobility and weight-bearing abilities compared to other Devonian limbed vertebrates such as \"&lt;a href=\"Ichthyostega\"&gt;Ichthyostega&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Acanthostega\"&gt;Acanthostega&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"cleithrum\"&gt;cleithrum&lt;/a&gt; (upper blade of the shoulder) is fused to the &lt;a href=\"scapulocoracoid\"&gt;scapulocoracoid&lt;/a&gt; (lower plate of the shoulder, in front of the shoulder socket), unlike in most tetrapods, but the shoulder girdle is independent of the skull, unlike in most fish.\nEarly four-limbed vertebrates are sometimes referred to as tetrapods (using a trait-based definition of the term), although animals like \"Hynerpeton, Ichthyostega,\" and \"Acanthostega\" are placed outside the &lt;a href=\"crown%20group\"&gt;crown group&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tetrapod\"&gt;Tetrapod&lt;/a&gt;a by the vast majority of paleontologists. From a &lt;a href=\"Cladistics\"&gt;cladistic&lt;/a&gt; (relations-based) point of view, a more accurate term would be \"&lt;a href=\"Stem%20tetrapoda\"&gt;stem-tetrapod&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"stegocephalia\"&gt;stegocephalia&lt;/a&gt;n\", indicating that they were part of the lineage of animals that would lead to true tetrapods such as modern &lt;a href=\"amphibian\"&gt;amphibian&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Lissamphibia\"&gt;Lissamphibia&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"reptile\"&gt;reptile&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mammal\"&gt;mammal&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"Hynerpeton\" hails from the Red Hill fossil site, which, during the Late Devonian, was a warm floodplain inhabited by a diverse ecosystem of aquatic fish and terrestrial &lt;a href=\"invertebrate\"&gt;invertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s. \"Hynerpeton\" was one of several genera of four-limbed vertebrates known from the site, although it was the first to be discovered. It has been theorized that animals like \"Hynerpeton\" were able to use their amphibious lifestyle to find shallow pools where they could &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20%28biology%29\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;, isolated from predatory fish which inhabited the deeper rivers.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Hynerpeton\" derives from &lt;a href=\"Hyner%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Hyner, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, the location of its discovery, and Ancient Greek ( 'creeping animal'), literally meaning 'creeping animal from Hyner'.\nHistory.\nIn 1993, &lt;a href=\"Paleontology\"&gt;paleontologist&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Daeschler\"&gt;Edward \"Ted\" Daeschler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Shubin\"&gt;Neil Shubin&lt;/a&gt; found the first \"Hynerpeton\" fossil at the Red Hill fossil site near &lt;a href=\"Hyner%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Hyner, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, USA. They were surveying the Devonian rocks of Pennsylvania in search of fossil evidence for the origin of limbed &lt;a href=\"vertebrate\"&gt;vertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s. This initial find was a robust left endochondral &lt;a href=\"shoulder%20girdle\"&gt;shoulder girdle&lt;/a&gt;, belonging to an animal which had powerful appendages. This fossil, designated &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Natural%20Sciences%20of%20Drexel%20University\"&gt;ANSP&lt;/a&gt; 20053, is now considered the &lt;a href=\"holotype\"&gt;holotype&lt;/a&gt; specimen of \"Hynerpeton\", which Daeschler and his colleagues formally named in an article published by &lt;a href=\"Science%20%28journal%29\"&gt;Science Magazine&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. At the time of its discovery, \"Hynerpeton\" was the oldest four-limbed vertebrate known from the United States, and its presence in a complex ecosystem such as that preserved at Red Hill helped to answer some of Daeschler and Shubin's questions on the origin and lifestyle of limbed vertebrates. The &lt;a href=\"Generic%20name%20%28biology%29\"&gt;generic name&lt;/a&gt; \"Hynerpeton\" is in reference to Hyner and \"herpeton\" (\"creeping animal\"), a Greek word which is commonly used as a suffix for newly named ancient amphibians. The &lt;a href=\"Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29\"&gt;specific name&lt;/a&gt;, \"bassetti\", is named in honor of &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Bassett\"&gt;Edward M. Bassett&lt;/a&gt;, an American city planner and Daeschler's grandfather.\nThe most fossiliferous &lt;a href=\"Stratum\"&gt;layer&lt;/a&gt; of the Red Hill site, the \"\"Hynerpeton\" &lt;a href=\"Lens%20%28geology%29\"&gt;lens&lt;/a&gt;\", was named after the genus. It is believed to have been deposited during the Middle to Upper &lt;a href=\"Famennian\"&gt;Famennian&lt;/a&gt; stage, about 365 to 363 million years ago. Since 1993, more &lt;a href=\"stegocephalia\"&gt;stegocephalia&lt;/a&gt;n remains have been found in the \"Hynerpeton\" lens (also known as the Farwell &lt;a href=\"paleosol\"&gt;paleosol&lt;/a&gt;s). These include shoulder bones, jaw bones, skull fragments, &lt;a href=\"gastralium\"&gt;gastralia&lt;/a&gt; (belly scutes), a &lt;a href=\"femur\"&gt;femur&lt;/a&gt;, and a large and unusually-shaped &lt;a href=\"humerus\"&gt;humerus&lt;/a&gt;. In 2000, a pair of jaw bones were assigned to a second genus, \"&lt;a href=\"Densignathus\"&gt;Densignathus&lt;/a&gt;,\" and other studies have argued that several additional unnamed taxa were present at the site, including possibly the oldest known &lt;a href=\"Whatcheeriidae\"&gt;whatcheeriid&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome of this material has been assigned to \"Hynerpeton,\" but in many cases, these assignments were reverted. For example, paleontologist &lt;a href=\"Jenny%20Clack\"&gt;Jenny Clack&lt;/a&gt; referred several addition fossils to the genus in her 1997 review of Devonian &lt;a href=\"trackway\"&gt;trackway&lt;/a&gt;s. These fossils, which had not been previously noted in the scientific literature, included a &lt;a href=\"Jugal%20bone\"&gt;jugal&lt;/a&gt; (cheek bone), belly scutes, and a portion of the mandible (lower jaw). In 2000, Daeschler described the mandible (ANSP 20901) in more depth, and compared and contrasted it with the remains of \"Densignathus\". A more comprehensive review of Red Hill \"&lt;a href=\"tetrapod\"&gt;tetrapod&lt;/a&gt;\" fossils was undertaken by Daeschler, Clack, and Shubin in 2009. They noted that most fossils were assigned to \"Hynerpeton\" based on their close proximity to the point where the original endochondral shoulder girdle was discovered. However, they argued that, since there were other unique animals (i.e. \"Densignathus\", the owner of the unusual humerus, and &lt;a href=\"Whatcheeriidae\"&gt;whatcheerids&lt;/a&gt;) close to this point, proximity was not a sufficient reason to consider these referrals valid. Therefore, they did not consider the remains described by Clack (1997) and Daeschler (2000) to be guaranteed examples of \"Hynerpeton\" material. Nevertheless, they did retain a referred left &lt;a href=\"cleithrum\"&gt;cleithrum&lt;/a&gt;, ANSP 20054, within the genus due to its structure being practically identical to that of the holotype.\nDescription.\n\"Hynerpeton\" individuals were presumably similar to other early limbed &lt;a href=\"vertebrate\"&gt;vertebrate&lt;/a&gt;s such as \"&lt;a href=\"Ichthyostega\"&gt;Ichthyostega&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Acanthostega\"&gt;Acanthostega&lt;/a&gt;\". Although a lack of sufficient fossil material makes it unwise to come to specific conclusions about the anatomy of \"Hynerpeton\", the structure of the preserved &lt;a href=\"Endochondral%20ossification\"&gt;endochondral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shoulder%20girdle\"&gt;shoulder girdle&lt;/a&gt; offers some information on its classification. The endochondral shoulder girdle is the portion of the shoulder girdle containing the &lt;a href=\"scapula\"&gt;scapula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coracoid\"&gt;coracoid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cleithrum\"&gt;cleithrum&lt;/a&gt;, but not the &lt;a href=\"clavicle\"&gt;clavicle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"interclavicle\"&gt;interclavicle&lt;/a&gt;. As a whole, the endochondral shoulder girdle is massive and &lt;a href=\"cleaver\"&gt;cleaver&lt;/a&gt;-shaped. The upward-pointing \"shaft\" is formed by the &lt;a href=\"cleithrum\"&gt;cleithrum&lt;/a&gt;, a blade-like bone of the shoulder girdle lost by most &lt;a href=\"amniote\"&gt;amniote&lt;/a&gt;s. The rear-pointing \"blade\" is formed by the &lt;a href=\"scapulocoracoid\"&gt;scapulocoracoid&lt;/a&gt;, a plate-like bone which also possesses the glenoid fossa (&lt;a href=\"Glenoid%20cavity\"&gt;shoulder socket&lt;/a&gt;) along its rear edge and in later tetrapods would separate into the scapula and coracoid. In &lt;a href=\"Sarcopterygii\"&gt;lobe-finned fish&lt;/a&gt; ancestral to tetrapods, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Eusthenopteron\"&gt;Eusthenopteron&lt;/a&gt;\", the endochondral shoulder girdle was attached to the skull. In true tetrapods, the endochondral shoulder girdle is divided into two separate bones: the cleithrum and scapulocoracoid. \"Hynerpeton\" is intermediate between these two states, as the endochondral shoulder girdle is separated from the skull but not yet divided into two separate bones. In this way \"Hynerpeton\" is comparable to Devonian stem-tetrapods rather than true tetrapods, which did not appear in the fossil record until the &lt;a href=\"Carboniferous\"&gt;Carboniferous&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the size of the bone, the \"Hynerpeton\" individual to which it belonged had an estimated length of 0.7 meters (2.3 feet).The cleithrum portion is smooth, unlike the rough-textured cleithrum of &lt;a href=\"Tetrapodomorpha\"&gt;tetrapodomorph&lt;/a&gt; fish. In addition, the upper portion of the cleithrum is expanded and slightly tilted forwards, a &lt;a href=\"Synapomorphy%20and%20apomorphy\"&gt;derived character&lt;/a&gt; similar to \"&lt;a href=\"Tulerpeton\"&gt;Tulerpeton&lt;/a&gt;\" and true tetrapods. The scapulocoracoid region is large when seen from the side but very thin when seen from below. The glenoid fossa (shoulder socket) is positioned on the posterolateral (outer and rear) edge of the scapulocoracoid, a position significantly more lateral than other Devonian tetrapods (apart from \"Tulerpeton\"). Above the glenoid fossa is a raised area known as the supraglenoid buttress.\n\"Hynerpeton\" also has several &lt;a href=\"Autapomorphy\"&gt;autapomorphies&lt;/a&gt;, unique features which no other known stem-tetrapod possesses. The inner face of the scapulocoracoid has a large, deep depression known as a subscapular fossa. The upper rim of this depression is very roughly textured due to being covered with muscle scars. The rear edge of the subscapular fossa, on the other hand, is formed by a massive raised area, known as an infraglenoid buttress. A second depression known as the infraglenoid fossa, which is continuous with the glenoid fossa, wraps around the rear of the bone to bisect the infraglenoid buttress.\nThese characteristics combined seem to support the idea that \"Hynerpeton\" had very powerful muscles attached to the scapulocoracoid portion of the endochondral shoulder girdle. The infraglenoid fossa is particularly well-developed in this genus, and may have been an origin point for &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Aretract\"&gt;retractor&lt;/a&gt; muscles. A similar groove on the front edge of the bone may have helped with &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Aelevate\"&gt;elevating&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Aprotract\"&gt;protracting&lt;/a&gt; the limb. The rim of the subscapular fossa also evidently provided a site for muscle attachment. As these features are unknown in other stem- and crown-tetrapods, it is likely that \"Hynerpeton's\" musculature was used for some unique, experimental form of movement that did not survive the Devonian. The original describers suggested that strong muscles could have been equally viable for walking or swimming.\nUnusually, \"Hynerpeton\" seems to lack a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/ontology/view.html%3Facc_id%3DUBERON%3A4200016\"&gt;postbranchial lamina&lt;/a&gt;. This blade of bone, preserved in many fish and some stem-tetrapods (\"Acanthostega\", for example) extends lengthwise along the inner edge of the cleithrum. It typically forms the rear wall of the branchial chamber (gill cavity), and may have helped ensure that water flows in a single direction through the &lt;a href=\"gill\"&gt;gill&lt;/a&gt;s. Its absence in \"Hynerpeton\" may indicate that it lacked gills, and that the \"Hynerpeton\" lineage may have been among the first vertebrates to evolve this adaptation. However, this interpretation is not without controversy. Janis &amp; Farmer (1999) noted that postbranchial laminae were absent in some &lt;a href=\"Tristichopteridae\"&gt;eusthenopterid&lt;/a&gt; fish (which retained gill bones) and present in \"Whatcheeria\" (which had no evidence for gills despite well-preserved remains). Shoch &amp; Witzmann (2011) note that it is not always clear when or how postbranchial laminae are preserved due to the divergent morphology of many &lt;a href=\"stegocephalia\"&gt;stegocephalia&lt;/a&gt;n cleithra. In addition, they point out that aquatic &lt;a href=\"salamander\"&gt;salamander&lt;/a&gt;s, which breathe with &lt;a href=\"external%20gills\"&gt;external gills&lt;/a&gt;, do not require nor possess postbranchial laminae. Daeschler \"et al.\" (1994) considered the loss of the postbranchial lamina to be a derived feature indicating that \"Hynerpeton\" was more \"advanced\" than \"Acanthostega.\" On the contrary, Schoch &amp; Witzmann (2011) found evidence for a postbranchial lamina in true tetrapods such as \"&lt;a href=\"Trematolestes\"&gt;Trematolestes&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Plagiosuchus\"&gt;Plagiosuchus&lt;/a&gt;.\" Thus, \"Hynerpeton\"'s loss of a postbranchial lamina (and possibly internal gills) likely evolved independently of true tetrapods.\nClassification.\nThe original 1994 description of \"Hynerpeton\" tentatively placed it within the &lt;a href=\"Order%20%28biology%29\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ichthyostegalia\"&gt;Ichthyostegalia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Superclass%20%28biology%29\"&gt;superclass&lt;/a&gt; Tetrapoda. At the time, \"Tetrapoda\" referred to any four-limbed vertebrate and \"Ichthyostegalia\" referred to \"primitive\", \"Ichthyostega\"-like Devonian members of the category. However, the arrival and popularity of &lt;a href=\"cladistics\"&gt;cladistics&lt;/a&gt; has altered both of these terms. The cladistic definition of \"tetrapod\" now popular among biologists and paleontologists refers to a &lt;a href=\"clade\"&gt;clade&lt;/a&gt; (relations-based grouping) containing only descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Most%20recent%20common%20ancestor\"&gt;last common ancestor&lt;/a&gt; of living tetrapods. While \"Hynerpeton\" is a tetrapod in the sense that it is a four-limbed vertebrate, it is not a member of the clade Tetrapoda because its lineage went extinct long before the lineages of modern tetrapods evolved. Likewise, \"Ichthyostegalia\" has been abandoned in the age of cladistics due to being an &lt;a href=\"evolutionary%20grade\"&gt;evolutionary grade&lt;/a&gt; leading to true tetrapods, rather than a relations-based clade. The traditional, non-cladistic definition of Tetrapoda, which begins at the earliest limbed vertebrates, corresponds closely to a clade named &lt;a href=\"Stegocephalia\"&gt;Stegocephalia&lt;/a&gt;, which is defined as all animals more closely related to &lt;a href=\"Temnospondyli\"&gt;temnospondyls&lt;/a&gt; than to \"&lt;a href=\"Panderichthys\"&gt;Pandericthys&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Hynerpeton\" has not been included in many &lt;a href=\"Phylogenetics\"&gt;phylogenetic analyses&lt;/a&gt;, but those that have included it usually place it as a transitional form on a series of stem-tetrapods leading to Tetrapoda. The shape of the cleithrum and the loss of the postbranchial lamina allow it to be placed higher than \"Acanthostega\" (and usually \"Ichthyostega\" as well), but the retention of a single-piece endochondral shoulder girdle usually means that it is not placed higher than \"Tulerpeton\". The following is a simplified cladogram based on Ruta, Jeffery, &amp; Coates (2003):\nPaleoecology.\n\"Hynerpeton\" was found at the Red Hill site of Pennsylvania. This &lt;a href=\"Cut%20%28earthmoving%29\"&gt;roadcut&lt;/a&gt; preserved fossils from the Duncannon member of the &lt;a href=\"Catskill%20Formation\"&gt;Catskill Formation&lt;/a&gt;, which was laid down in an ancient coastal &lt;a href=\"floodplain\"&gt;floodplain&lt;/a&gt;. During the late Devonian, the floodplain was close to the equator, so the climate was warm and humid, with a dry and wet season. It formed along the coast of a shallow sea which bisected the continent &lt;a href=\"Euramerica\"&gt;Euramerica&lt;/a&gt;, and was dominated by several small, slow rivers flowing down from the &lt;a href=\"Acadian%20orogeny\"&gt;Acadian mountains&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern part of the continent. These rivers were prone to changing their course dramatically, creating &lt;a href=\"oxbow%20lake\"&gt;oxbow lake&lt;/a&gt;s and ponds adjacent to the main river channels. The most abundant plants were forests of ancient broadleaf trees (\"&lt;a href=\"Archaeopteris\"&gt;Archaeopteris&lt;/a&gt;\") supplemented with marshes filled with &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;-like plants (\"&lt;a href=\"Rhacophyton\"&gt;Rhacophyton&lt;/a&gt;\"). &lt;a href=\"Wildfire\"&gt;Wildfire&lt;/a&gt;s were common during the dry season, as evidenced by the large amount of charred \"Rhacophyton\" material. Other plants include &lt;a href=\"Lycopodiopsida\"&gt;lycopsids&lt;/a&gt; such as \"&lt;a href=\"Lepidodendropsis\"&gt;Lepidodendropsis&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Otzinachsonia\"&gt;Otzinachsonia&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as difficult-to-place herbs and shrubs such as \"&lt;a href=\"Barinophyton\"&gt;Barinophyton&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Gillespiea%20randolphensis\"&gt;Gillespiea&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe animal life of Red Hill was also quite diverse. Early &lt;a href=\"arachnid\"&gt;arachnid&lt;/a&gt;s (\"&lt;a href=\"Gigantocharinus\"&gt;Gigantocharinus&lt;/a&gt;\"), &lt;a href=\"millipede\"&gt;millipede&lt;/a&gt;s (\"&lt;a href=\"Orsadesmus\"&gt;Orsadesmus&lt;/a&gt;\"), and undescribed &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s were among the few fully terrestrial members of the Red Hill fauna. The waterways were inhabited by a large variety of fish. &lt;a href=\"Benthic%20zone\"&gt;Benthic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Placodermi\"&gt;placoderms&lt;/a&gt; such as the rare \"&lt;a href=\"Phyllolepis\"&gt;Phyllolepis&lt;/a&gt;\", the common \"&lt;a href=\"Groenlandaspis\"&gt;Groenlandaspis&lt;/a&gt;,\" and the abundant \"&lt;a href=\"Turrisaspis\"&gt;Turriaspis&lt;/a&gt;\" were a large part of the fish assemblage. The early ray-finned fish \"&lt;a href=\"Limnomis\"&gt;Limnomis&lt;/a&gt;\" was also abundant, likely forming large schools. Early &lt;a href=\"shark\"&gt;shark&lt;/a&gt;s were present, including the minuscule \"&lt;a href=\"Ageleodus\"&gt;Ageleodus&lt;/a&gt;\" and the spine-finned \"&lt;a href=\"Ctenacanthus\"&gt;Ctenacanthus&lt;/a&gt;\". Various lobe-finned fish populated the floodplain, as well as the large &lt;a href=\"Acanthodii\"&gt;acanthodian&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Gyracanthus\"&gt;Gyracanthus&lt;/a&gt;.\" The apex predator of the assemblage was \"&lt;a href=\"Hyneria\"&gt;Hyneria&lt;/a&gt;\", a 3-meter (10 feet) long tetrapodomorph fish.\n\"Hynerpeton\" was not the only purported four-limbed vertebrate at the site. A somewhat larger genus, \"Densignathus\", coexisted alongside it. In addition, an unusual humerus incompatible with the endochondral shoulder girdle of \"Hynerpeton\" may show that a third genus lived in the floodplain. Skull fragments similar to those of whatcheeriids such as \"&lt;a href=\"Pederpes\"&gt;Pederpes&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Whatcheeria\"&gt;Whatcheeria&lt;/a&gt;\" may indicate that a fourth genus was also present, though their referral to whatcheeriids has been questioned. The depositional environment and fauna of the Red Hill site offered new hypotheses for the questions on why and how terrestriality evolved in stem-tetrapods. The Catskill floodplain never became dry enough for its waterways to completely dry up, but at certain times of the year shallow ponds became isolated from the main river channels. Terrestrial or semiaquatic animals could have used these ponds as refuge from the larger predatory fish which patrolled the deeper waterways. A modern equivalent would probably be the &lt;a href=\"Murray%20River\"&gt;Murray River&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. In this subtropical modern environment experiencing wet and dry seasons, &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20%28biology%29\"&gt;spawning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"golden%20perch\"&gt;golden perch&lt;/a&gt; (\"Macquaria ambigua\") take refuge in oxbow lakes to escape larger, faster &lt;a href=\"murray%20cod\"&gt;murray cod&lt;/a&gt; (\"Maccullochella peeli\") in the main river channel. In a Devonian environment, vertebrates with terrestrial capabilities may have had the advantage when navigating between these different environments. The flexibility imparted by such a lifestyle could also have let them take advantage of a larger variety of food sources."
