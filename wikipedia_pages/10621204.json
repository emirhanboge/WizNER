    "text": "\u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu (1385\u20131468) (&lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Turkish%20language\"&gt;Ottoman Turkish&lt;/a&gt;: \u0634\u0631\u0641\u200c\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0651\u06cc\u0646 \u0635\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0646\u062c\u06cc\u200c\u0627\u0648\u063a\u0644\u06cc) was a medieval &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"surgeon\"&gt;surgeon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"physician\"&gt;physician&lt;/a&gt;. \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu started his medical interests at the age of 17. He would continue with this medical interest and practice in Amasya Dar-es Sifa Hospital until he died. \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu was the director of the Amasya Dar-es Sifa Hospital for almost 14 years.\nBiography.\n\u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu lived during the 15th century in &lt;a href=\"Amasya\"&gt;Amasya&lt;/a&gt;. During the early period of the Ottoman Empire, Amasya was a center of commerce, culture, and arts. During this period, Serafeddin Sabuncuoglu practiced medicine in Amasya Hospital, which was built in 1308.\nSabuncuo\u011flu was the author of the \"Cerrahiyyetu'l-Haniyye\" (\"Imperial Surgery\"), the first illustrated surgical &lt;a href=\"anatomy%20atlas\"&gt;atlas&lt;/a&gt;, and the \"M\u00fccerrebname\" (\"On Attemption\").\nSabuncuo\u011flu authored \"Imperial Surgery\", the first illustrated Turkish-written medical textbook, in 1465 at the age of 80. \"Imperial Surgery\" is divided into three chapters dealing with 191 topics in the course of 412 pages. Three original handwritten copies survive, two in Sabuncuoglu's own hand; each copy is slightly different and none is complete. The originals are housed in Istanbul's &lt;a href=\"Fatih%20Millet%20Library\"&gt;Fatih Millet Library&lt;/a&gt;, the Capa Medical History Department of &lt;a href=\"Istanbul%20University\"&gt;Istanbul University&lt;/a&gt;, and in the &lt;a href=\"Biblioth%C3%A8que%20Nationale\"&gt;Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale&lt;/a&gt; in Paris.\nSabuncuo\u011flu 's \"Imperial Surgery\" was the first surgical atlas and the last major &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20medicine\"&gt;medical encyclopedia from the Islamic world&lt;/a&gt;. Though his work was largely based on &lt;a href=\"Abu%20al-Qasim%20al-Zahrawi\"&gt;Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Al-Tasrif\"&gt;Al-Tasrif&lt;/a&gt;\", Sabuncuo\u011flu introduced many innovations of his own. Female surgeons were also illustrated for the first time in the \"Imperial Surgery\". One of the surgical techniques described by Sabuncuo\u011flu was the ligating of the temporal artery for migraine.\nCerrahiyyet'u\u00a8l Haniye (Imperial Surgery).\nCerrahiyyet\u2019u\u00a8l Haniye (Imperial Surgery) was \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu's most important book for medicine out of his known seven books. Cerrahiyyet\u2019u\u00a8l Haniye was rediscovered by the historian in 1939. This book was then studied in 1992 by Ilter Uzel and then translated into modern Turkish, English, and Arabic. In \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu's medical textbook, Cerrahiyyet\u2019u\u00a8l Haniye, the descriptions of the diagnosis, classifications, and techniques used are explained in detail in the Turkish language. Cerrahiyyet\u2019u\u00a8l Haniye was written in rhyme and meter in describing the different treatments, which was common practice for writers of the time. This book was mostly a modification and compilation of other medical techniques from &lt;a href=\"Al-Zahrawi\"&gt;Al-Zahrawi&lt;/a&gt;, but Sabuncuo\u011flu did contribute to unique ideas in this textbook. These include three new chapter that incorporate 134 surgical interventions and 156 surgical instruments. These three chapters discussed &lt;a href=\"cauterization\"&gt;cauterization&lt;/a&gt; treatments, surgical procedures, fractures and dislocations, and cancer related issues. \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu made sure to describe surgical complications and cite any knowledge he attained from others. When Cerrahiyyet\u2019u\u00a8l Haniye was completed, it was presented to the Ottoman emperor &lt;a href=\"Mehmed%20the%20Conqueror\"&gt;Sultan Mehmet II&lt;/a&gt;. Cerrahiyyet\u2019u\u00a8l Haniye shows that \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu believed that women had an important role as physicians. Female surgeons were depicted in his illustrations involving &lt;a href=\"Gynaecology\"&gt;gynecology&lt;/a&gt;. The female surgeons were called \u201ctabiba\u201d in the book. These &lt;a href=\"Gynaecology\"&gt;gynecology&lt;/a&gt; illustrations were also important in portraying the correct position of the patient.\nIn these treatments, \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu used his own observations from experimenting with animals to develop new treatments. Successful treatments were then transcribed to surgical procedures in humans. \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu would only transcribe and illustrate the treatments after he completed the treatments himself. He would even test therapeutic treatments on himself before applying them on patients. \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu was also aware of &lt;a href=\"sepsis\"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;. In order to prevent the spread of a pathogen, he would wear a surgical attire that involved wine and olive oil as &lt;a href=\"antiseptic\"&gt;antiseptic&lt;/a&gt;s. In one such treatment, \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu discussed a &lt;a href=\"breast%20cancer\"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatment in which the suggested treatment was to surgically remove the small cancers in their early stage. This treatment ensures that the &lt;a href=\"Neoplasm\"&gt;tumor&lt;/a&gt; does not spread or grow to the rest of the body, which is common practice for treating cancer today. Many of these treatments in Cerrahiyyet\u2019u\u00a8l Haniye have illustrations accompanied next to them, which ensure that the intended audience are able to follow the treatment correctly. Every illustration contains a distinct physician and patient along with the tools used in the treatment.\nIn \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu treatment of epilepsy, he used the technique of skull &lt;a href=\"cauterization\"&gt;cauterization&lt;/a&gt; as a way of purifying the body from evil spirits. This demonstrates the religious and incomplete understanding of some of the medical issues that were prevalent in the past. This was evident in the recovery phase of his &lt;a href=\"epilepsy\"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt; treatment where he states, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to give the patient the following foods to enable the dehydration in order that the patient can recover, with the permission of &lt;a href=\"Allah\"&gt;Allah&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu recommended using a non-invasive and less intense treatment first before moving on to a stronger treatment. In his &lt;a href=\"epilepsy\"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt; treatment, herbal mixtures were recommended to be used first, then a &lt;a href=\"cauterization\"&gt;cauterization&lt;/a&gt; on the forehead could be used if the herbal mixtures did not work. \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu was also careful in not over-treating a patient. In \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu's description and diagnosis of &lt;a href=\"Spondylolisthesis\"&gt;spinal dislocations&lt;/a&gt;, he mentions how swelling after the treatment is normal and that repeating the treatment could lead to the death of the patient.\nMedical Innovations.\nSerafeddin Sabuncuoglu was one of the first to describe &lt;a href=\"Hydrocephalus\"&gt;hydrocephalic&lt;/a&gt; drainage techniques in children. &lt;a href=\"Hydrocephalus\"&gt;Hydrocephalus&lt;/a&gt; is the medical condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. The treatment of children and women were rarely found during this period as they were widely considered assets prior to the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance period&lt;/a&gt;. However, \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu did not have specific descriptions and understanding of &lt;a href=\"hydrocephalus\"&gt;hydrocephalus&lt;/a&gt;. It was after 150 years from \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu's initial description and diagnosis that &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Aurelio%20Severino\"&gt;Marco Aurelio Severino&lt;/a&gt; would officially describe and classify this procedure. \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu was also the first to use an axial traction technique for spinal surgery. He also pioneered the usage of a wooden splint after &lt;a href=\"hand%20surgery\"&gt;hand surgery&lt;/a&gt;. An important observation that \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu made in Cerrahiyyet\u2019u\u00a8l Haniye was that a fast delivery of a baby can occur if the patient holds their breath and exerts a strong force. He recommended herbal drugs that would cause the patient to sneeze in order to exert a stronger force. \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu also describes complications that occur during pregnancy and how to prevent the death of the mother. His main techniques involve the insertion of a hook on a dead fetus to extract the baby out of the mother. \u015eerafeddin Sabuncuo\u011flu also suggested crushing the fetus\u2019 skull with the \u201cMi dah\u201d instrument if the &lt;a href=\"Hydrocephalus\"&gt;hydrocephaly&lt;/a&gt; was causing the obstruction."
