    "text": "Leonard Gyllenhaal (3 December 1752 \u2013 13 May 1840) was a &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; military officer and &lt;a href=\"entomology\"&gt;entomologist&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorn on the Ribbingsberg &lt;a href=\"Manorialism\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4sterg%C3%B6tland\"&gt;V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland&lt;/a&gt; in west Sweden, Leonard Gyllenhaal was son of an army officer and belonged to a family of the lower nobility. He went to school (&lt;a href=\"Skara%20trivialskola\"&gt;Skara trivialskola&lt;/a&gt;) in the cathedral town of &lt;a href=\"Skara\"&gt;Skara&lt;/a&gt; together with, among others, the future poet &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Henrik%20Kellgren\"&gt;Johan Henrik Kellgren&lt;/a&gt;, and later renowned naturalists &lt;a href=\"Anders%20Dahl\"&gt;Anders Dahl&lt;/a&gt; and the brothers &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Afzelius\"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johan%20Afzelius\"&gt;Johan Afzelius&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he went on natural excursions. Like some of his friends, he went to &lt;a href=\"Uppsala%20University\"&gt;Uppsala&lt;/a&gt; to study under &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt; in 1769. He never matriculated and remained in Uppsala only one semester, before switching to a military career in accordance with the wishes and traditions of the family, enrolling in the \"&lt;a href=\"Adelsfanan\"&gt;Adelsfanan&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Swedish%20Banner%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;\"Banner of Nobles\"&lt;/a&gt;) cavalry regiment, and a few years later transferring to the &lt;a href=\"drabantk%C3%A5ren\"&gt;drabantk\u00e5ren&lt;/a&gt; (Garde du Corps). Gyllenhaal, however, remained in contact with Linnaeus through an extensive correspondence and continued to work as an amateur &lt;a href=\"natural%20history\"&gt;naturalist&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe remained in military service until 1799, when he retired with the rank of &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;. As this did not take all of his time \u2013 different detachments of the Garde du Corps served at the royal court for only brief periods each year \u2013 he worked on his father's estate H\u00f6berg in &lt;a href=\"Norra%20V%C3%A5nga\"&gt;Norra V\u00e5nga&lt;/a&gt; parish in &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A4sterg%C3%B6tland\"&gt;V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland&lt;/a&gt;, which he managed on his own from 1784. He developed the estate, experimenting with new crops such as the American &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis main interest ever since youth was &lt;a href=\"entomology\"&gt;entomology&lt;/a&gt;, and already in 1775 he had collected some 1300 largely unidentified beetle species from the western part of &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6taland\"&gt;G\u00f6taland&lt;/a&gt;. He built a private entomological museum, library and study on H\u00f6berg which he called the \"Fly house\". At his death, he had a collection of 400 boxes of prepared and identified insects, which he left to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swedish%20Society%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;Royal Swedish Society of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in Uppsala (later deposited at the Uppsala University Museum of Zoology). His main publication was the \"Insecta Suecica\", describing the insects of Sweden, which took him 30 years to complete and was awarded the gold medal of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. Another claim to fame for Gyllenhaal is the fact that he named the common beetle family of &lt;a href=\"Histeridae\"&gt;Histeridae&lt;/a&gt;. He was also elected an honorary member of the French &lt;a href=\"Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20entomologique%20de%20France\"&gt;Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 entomologique&lt;/a&gt;. He was appointed a Knight of the Royal &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Vasa\"&gt;Order of Vasa&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeonard Gyllenhaal was a leading Swedenborgian who supported the printing and spreading of &lt;a href=\"Emanuel%20Swedenborg\"&gt;Swedenborg&lt;/a&gt;'s writings. His grandson, the Swedish-American journalist &lt;a href=\"Anders%20Leonard%20Gyllenhaal\"&gt;Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal&lt;/a&gt;, retained the faith of his grandfather and was a member of the Swedenborgian &lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Church%20%28Swedenborgian%29\"&gt;New Church&lt;/a&gt;. His descendants in the American branch of the family include the actor siblings &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Gyllenhaal\"&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maggie%20Gyllenhaal\"&gt;Maggie Gyllenhaal&lt;/a&gt;."
