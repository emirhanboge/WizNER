    "text": "The Estadi Municipal Palam\u00f3s Costa Brava is a multi-use stadium located in &lt;a href=\"Palam%C3%B3s\"&gt;Palam\u00f3s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catalonia\"&gt;Catalonia&lt;/a&gt;, Spain. It is currently used for &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; matches and is the home stadium of &lt;a href=\"Palam%C3%B3s%20CF\"&gt;Palam\u00f3s CF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"UE%20Costa%20Brava\"&gt;UE Costa Brava&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nPalam\u00f3s Costa Brava was inaugurated on 29 August 1989 under the name of \"Nou Estadi Municipal de Palam\u00f3s\", being the new home stadium of &lt;a href=\"Palam%C3%B3s%20CF\"&gt;Palam\u00f3s CF&lt;/a&gt; and replacing Camp de Cervantes. Its first match was a 2\u20131 &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20match\"&gt;friendly&lt;/a&gt; win against neighbours &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; on the same day.\nThe stadium's first competitive match took charge on 10 September, a 1\u20131 draw against &lt;a href=\"Levante%20UD\"&gt;Levante UD&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n\"&gt;Segunda Divisi\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt; championship. This was the club's most successful period, as it remained in the second level for six consecutive campaigns.\nOn 7 July 2014 the stadium was named as the new home ground of &lt;a href=\"UE%20Llagostera\"&gt;UE Llagostera&lt;/a&gt; for the following five seasons, as the club's stadium, \"Estadi Municipal de Llagostera\", didn't meet the &lt;a href=\"Liga%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20Profesional\"&gt;LFP&lt;/a&gt; criteria. On 2 August, it was renamed to \"Estadi Municipal Palam\u00f3s Costa Brava\".\nIn the 2015 summer, the stadium was renovated by adding seats in all the stands, and had its capacity reduced to 3,724 spectators. On 27 July 2021, Llagostera announced that the club would play in the stadium again for the ensuing campaign; four days later, the club changed name to &lt;a href=\"UE%20Costa%20Brava\"&gt;UE Costa Brava&lt;/a&gt;."
