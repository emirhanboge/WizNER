    "text": "Francisco \"Bobby\" Tronqued Ma\u00f1osa (12 February 1931 \u2013 20 February 2019) was a Filipino architect considered one of the most influential Filipino architects of the 20th century for having pioneered the art of Philippine neovernacular architecture. His contributions to the development of Philippine architecture led to his recognition as a &lt;a href=\"National%20Artist%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;National Artist of the Philippines for Architecture&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.\nAlthough he was popularly known as the architect of the &lt;a href=\"Coconut%20Palace\"&gt;Coconut Palace&lt;/a&gt;, his other notable works include the &lt;a href=\"EDSA%20Shrine\"&gt;EDSA Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, the Mary Immaculate Parish (Nature's Church) in Las Pi\u00f1as, the Davao Pearl Farm, and &lt;a href=\"Amanpulo\"&gt;Amanpulo&lt;/a&gt; resorts.\nMa\u00f1osa devoted his life's work to creating a Filipino identity in architecture, advocating design philosophies that harken \"back to the &lt;a href=\"bahay%20kubo\"&gt;bahay kubo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bahay%20na%20bato\"&gt;bahay na bato&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d and other traditional vernacular forms. Ma\u00f1osa became known for combining these traditional forms and indigenous materials with modern building technology to create structures which he felt were those best suited to the Philippines' tropical climate.\nEarly life and education.\nMa\u00f1osa was born in &lt;a href=\"Manila\"&gt;Manila, Philippines&lt;/a&gt; on 12 February 1931, growing up in a genteel neighborhood on Azcarraga Street (later renamed &lt;a href=\"Recto%20Avenue\"&gt;Recto Avenue&lt;/a&gt;). His parents were Mar\u00eda Tronqued, one of the early actresses of &lt;a href=\"Philippine%20Cinema\"&gt;Philippine Cinema&lt;/a&gt;, and Manuel Ma\u00f1osa Sr., a &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;-educated sanitary engineer who was director of the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Waterworks%20and%20Sewerage%20System\"&gt;Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System&lt;/a&gt; from 1947 to 1955.\nNicknamed \"Booby\" in the American-inspired fashion of the era, he played &lt;a href=\"jazz%20piano\"&gt;jazz piano&lt;/a&gt; and initially wanted a career in music, but studied architecture at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Santo%20Tomas\"&gt;University of Santo Tomas&lt;/a&gt; on the insistence of his father.\nCareer.\nMa\u00f1osa was known for his advocacy of what has been called \"Philippine neovernacular architecture.\" His design aesthetic incorporated Philippine design motifs and local materials such as &lt;a href=\"coconut\"&gt;coconut&lt;/a&gt; and local &lt;a href=\"hardwoods\"&gt;hardwoods&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspiration from Japan.\nMa\u00f1osa spent a year in Japan immediately after his graduation from college, because his father insisted that he spend \"at least one year somewhere in the world\" Ma\u00f1osa opted to go to Japan, which had also inspired architect &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright\"&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was struck by the way that Japanese architecture reflected a consistent design which drew from Japanese culture, regardless of how elaborate the building was, or whether it was traditional and modern. His wife Denise, whom he married at around this time, recounts that this experience inspired Ma\u00f1osa to pursue a design aesthetic with a similar consistency, reflective of Filipino culture.\nInspiration from the Bahay Kubo.\nUpon coming home from Japan, Ma\u00f1osa began working in the family architectural firm, Ma\u00f1osa Brothers, with his brothers Manuel Jr. and Jos\u00e9. But he began insisting that he take on projects that were Filipino in design, rather than the &lt;a href=\"Modernist%20architecture\"&gt;Modernist&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"International%20Style%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;International style&lt;/a&gt; buildings that were in vogue at the time.\nMa\u00f1osa developed a modern architectural style whose touchstone was the traditional Filipino square house, the \"&lt;a href=\"bahay%20kubo\"&gt;bahay kubo&lt;/a&gt;\". He used indigenous materials and experimented with new technologies so that it would be usable in a modern context.\nPhilippine architecture historian Gerard Lico describes Ma\u00f1osa's style, saying:\"His approach to traditional design is based on the ability of the architect to identify the essential building elements and to translate them into a contemporary image. His architecture is not a mere mechanical mimicry of vernacular architecture, which many would think to be locked in time. He initiated a contemporary mode that uses and revitalizes the knowledge from previous generations, recovering age-old constructive methods and finishing materials, emphasizing their optical and thermal qualities.\u201d\nAmong his \"bahay kubo\"-inspired works are the stations of &lt;a href=\"LRT%20Line%201%20%28Metro%20Manila%29\"&gt;Manila Light Rail Transit Line 1&lt;/a&gt; network.\nBreakthrough: San Miguel Corporation Headquarters Building.\nMa\u00f1osa's breakthrough as an architect happened while he was still working at Ma\u00f1osa Brothers, when the firm was hired to design the new headquarters of &lt;a href=\"San%20Miguel%20Corporation\"&gt;San Miguel Corporation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mandaluyong\"&gt;Mandaluyong&lt;/a&gt;. The brothers designed a building which was inspired by the Banaue rice terraces, with \u201c&lt;a href=\"green%20building\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;\u201d design features which were ahead of the times.\nThe Coconut Palace.\nMa\u00f1osa's insitance on only taking on projects with a Filipino identity eventually led him to leave Ma\u00f1osa Brothers and put up his own firm. Because he had built up his name designing the San Miguel Corporation headquarters, he was asked by &lt;a href=\"Imelda%20Marcos\"&gt;Imelda Marcos&lt;/a&gt; to build the \"Tahanang Pilipino\" (lit. Filipino home, often referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Coconut%20Palace\"&gt;Coconut Palace&lt;/a&gt;), within the &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20Center%20of%20the%20Philippines%20Complex\"&gt;Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe project became controversial, because the opulent design was paid for with government funds and was soon cited as a prominent example of Marcos' &lt;a href=\"Edifice%20complex\"&gt;Edifice Complex&lt;/a&gt; excesses. The palace was completed in time for &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;'s visit in 1981 for the beatification of &lt;a href=\"Lorenzo%20Ruiz\"&gt;Lorenzo Ruiz&lt;/a&gt;. Mrs Marcos invited him to stay at the newly constructed palace, but the offer was declined by the Pope because it was too opulent given the level of poverty in the Philippines. But it eventually became a guest house for celebrity visitors of the Marcoses until they were deposed and exiled by the civilian-backed &lt;a href=\"People%20Power%20Revolution\"&gt;People Power Revolution&lt;/a&gt; in 1986.\nAlthough the controversy and the relative disuse of the building since its construction, the Coconut Palace has come to be recognized as one of the most prominent examples of Philippine neovernacular architecture, and made Ma\u00f1osa a highly-sought-after artist.\nThe EDSA Shrine.\nAfter the Marcoses were sent into exile in 1986, &lt;a href=\"Jaime%20Cardinal%20Sin\"&gt;Jaime Cardinal Sin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Archdiocese%20of%20Manila\"&gt;Archdiocese of Manila&lt;/a&gt; began conceiving of a shrine that would celebrate the &lt;a href=\"People%20Power%20Revolution\"&gt;People Power Revolution&lt;/a&gt; which had deposed them. Cardinal Sin's appeal for people to rally in the streets had played a pivotal role in assuring that the uprising succeeded without the need for bloodshed, and Philippines' large Catholic majority characterized its success a \"miracle.\" So the Cardinal approached Ma\u00f1osa about designing a shrine commemorating the event.\nMa\u00f1osa had first proposed a completely different design for the shrine, above-ground and based on the \"bahay kubo\". However, this design was disapproved when \"an influential member of the committee\" insisted on a Spanish design for the church. Ma\u00f1osa walked out on the project, staying true to his \"I design Filipino, nothing else\" policy. Ma\u00f1osa's wife later quoted him saying to the committee: Cardinal Sin asked Ma\u00f1osa to reconsider, so Ma\u00f1osa came back and developed a new \"People\u2019s Plaza\" design which would be used for the actual project. The &lt;a href=\"EDSA%20Shrine\"&gt;EDSA Shrine&lt;/a&gt; was completed in 1989.\nThe Parish church of St. Joseph (Bamboo Organ Church).\nBetween 1971 and 1975, the &lt;a href=\"Las%20Pi%C3%B1as%20Church\"&gt;Saint Joseph Parish Church&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Bamboo%20Organ\"&gt;Las Pi\u00f1as Bamboo Organ&lt;/a&gt;, and the surrounding buildings were restored to their 19th-century state by Ma\u00f1osa and partner Ludwig Alvarez, through the administration of Rev. Fr. Mark Lesage, &lt;a href=\"CICM%20Missionaries\"&gt;CICM&lt;/a&gt;, to bring back the 19th-century look of the church and to re-position the main altar to face the people, as required by the new Ecumenical Church guidelines.\nPersonal life.\nBy the 2010s, Ma\u00f1osa was a retired but decorated architect. His three children all work for the family company, Ma\u00f1osa &amp; Company. Isabel (\"Bambi\"), the eldest and only daughter, is the head of the interior design department, as well as a director of Tukod Foundation, a foundation of the Ma\u00f1osa Group which advocates the advancement of Filipino design, art and aesthetics. Francisco Jr. (\"Dino\") acts as CEO of the entire Ma\u00f1osa Group, and is the founder and CEO of Ma\u00f1osa Properties. Francisco's youngest son, Angelo (\"Gelo\"), carries on his father's architectural legacy as the CEO of Ma\u00f1osa &amp; Company.\nWhile not working on his projects for the company, Ma\u00f1osa was also part of the jazz band The Executive Band. He played piano for the band.\nIn 2012, Ma\u00f1osa fell and cracked two &lt;a href=\"vertebrae\"&gt;vertebrae&lt;/a&gt; which had to be fused in order to heal. He also needed &lt;a href=\"heart%20bypass%20surgery\"&gt;heart bypass surgery&lt;/a&gt; in order to repair a life-threatening ventricular blockage.\nDeath.\nMa\u00f1osa died on 20 February 2019, due to prostate cancer. He was 88. Ma\u00f1osa's remains received full state honors when laid to rest at the &lt;a href=\"Libingan%20ng%20mga%20Bayani\"&gt;Libingan ng mga Bayani&lt;/a&gt;."
