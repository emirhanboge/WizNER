    "text": "The Kallikratis Programme () is the common name of &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; law 3852/2010 of 2010, a major administrative reform in &lt;a href=\"Greece\"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. It brought about the second major reform of the country's &lt;a href=\"Administrative%20divisions%20of%20Greece\"&gt;administrative divisions&lt;/a&gt; following the 1997 &lt;a href=\"Kapodistrias%20reform\"&gt;Kapodistrias reform&lt;/a&gt;.\nNamed after ancient Greek architect &lt;a href=\"Callicrates\"&gt;Callicrates&lt;/a&gt;, the programme was presented by the socialist &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20George%20Papandreou\"&gt;Papandreou cabinet&lt;/a&gt; and was adopted by the &lt;a href=\"Hellenic%20Parliament\"&gt;Hellenic Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in May 2010. The programme's implementation started with the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20local%20elections%2C%202010\"&gt;November 2010 local elections&lt;/a&gt;, and was completed by January 2011.\nHistory.\nAdministrative reforms in the 1990s.\n1994 reforms under the socialist &lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Papandreou\"&gt;Papandreou government&lt;/a&gt; turned the largely dysfunctional &lt;a href=\"Prefectures%20of%20Greece\"&gt;prefectures&lt;/a&gt; into Prefectural Self-Government entities (PSGs) with prefects and prefectural councils both being popularly elected. In return, the thirteen &lt;a href=\"administrative%20regions%20of%20Greece\"&gt;administrative regions of Greece&lt;/a&gt;, which had already been created in 1987, but in the absence of a working budget remained unable to fulfill even their limited responsibilities, now assumed the prefectures' competences in regard to &lt;a href=\"tax%20collection\"&gt;tax collection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Structural%20Funds%20and%20Cohesion%20Fund\"&gt;European structural funding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"treasury\"&gt;treasury&lt;/a&gt;.\nPart of the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Kapodistrias%20plan\"&gt;Kapodistrias plan&lt;/a&gt;, Law 2539/1997 sharply reduced the number of &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20and%20communities%20of%20Greece\"&gt;municipalities and communities&lt;/a&gt; from 5.823 to 1.033, after the increasing &lt;a href=\"urbanization\"&gt;urbanization&lt;/a&gt; had left small communities literally dying out. With a median of just 4,661.5 inhabitants, a large number of small municipalities and rural communities however remained independent. This included 88 communities with a population of less than 1000, down to &lt;a href=\"Gramos%2C%20Greece\"&gt;Gramos&lt;/a&gt; with just 28 inhabitants.\nWith the territorial reforms of the 1990s, Greece has been cited as the first southern European country to follow a coercive top-down approach for territorial reforms, an approach rather typical for northern European countries. Though strengthened by the 1990s reforms, the prefectural second-tier level however did not meet expectations. Largely subverted by an uncoordinated but convergent anti-reform opposition, the reformed prefectures lost a number of important competences following court decisions. The numerous controversies largely undermined public trust in the prefectural level.\nThe failed Kapodistrias II.\nAfter the electoral victory of the liberal-conservative &lt;a href=\"New%20Democracy%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;New Democracy&lt;/a&gt; party in &lt;a href=\"Greek%20legislative%20election%2C%202004\"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Cabinet%20of%20Kostas%20Karamanlis\"&gt;Karamanlis government&lt;/a&gt; had initially been reluctant to pursue further administrative reforms, as it had opposed the reforms of the 1990s. In a late implementation of a provision that was already part of the Kapodistrias plan, the 147 &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Greece\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt;, as subunits of the 51 prefectures, were abolished in 2007.\nIt was only after the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20legislative%20election%2C%202007\"&gt;2007 reelection&lt;/a&gt;, that the Karamanlis government decided that further reforms were necessary, to bring the territorial structure in line with the European Union's &lt;a href=\"Lisbon%20Strategy\"&gt;Lisbon Strategy&lt;/a&gt; and the requirements of the Fourth Programming Period (2007\u20132013). The thirteen regions were planned to be combined to just six major \"programmatic supra-regions\" that were expected to more successfully compete for &lt;a href=\"Structural%20Funds%20and%20Cohesion%20Fund\"&gt;European structural funding&lt;/a&gt;. Municipalities should be amalgamated from 1034 down to 400 and prefectural governments reduced from 50 down to 16, in order to overcome fragmentation, to facilitate fiscal control by the state and to create &lt;a href=\"economy%20of%20scale\"&gt;economies of scale&lt;/a&gt;.\nPutting administrative efficiency first, the top-down reform plan was criticized as subordinating questions of &lt;a href=\"legitimacy%20%28political%29\"&gt;legitimacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"participation%20%28decision%20making%29\"&gt;participation&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than being opposed by the parliamentary opposition, the plan faced obstruction by the more conservative camp within the governing party and ultimately failed.\nKallikratis: New attempt at administrative reform.\nFollowing the landslide victory of the socialist &lt;a href=\"PASOK\"&gt;PASOK&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20legislative%20election%2C%202009\"&gt;early 2009 legislative election&lt;/a&gt;, a new attempt at further administrative reforms was started. The Kallikratis plan was presented to the public in January 2010, amidst the beginnings of the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20government-debt%20crisis\"&gt;Greek financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;. While in terms of figures rather similar to the failed \"New Democracy\" plans, it was not confined to reducing the sheer number of administrative entities and their state accountability. In a country which has been widely regarded as the most &lt;a href=\"centralism\"&gt;centralist&lt;/a&gt; country of the European Union, with many smaller municipalities, especially rural communities being \"extremely understaffed and deprived of any possibility to fulfil their tasks,\" an emphasis was put on strengthening the remaining authorities in terms of autonomy of &lt;a href=\"self-governance\"&gt;self-governance&lt;/a&gt;, public transparency and overall accessibility to citizens. At the same time, the programme aimed at reducing local government employees by 50%, from around 50.000 to 25.000 across the country.\nThe law was adopted in May 2010 and was implemented following the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20local%20elections%2C%202010\"&gt;November 2010 local elections&lt;/a&gt; comprising the constituting regional elections, which replaced provincial elections as they were held before in &lt;a href=\"Greek%20local%20elections%2C%202002\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greek%20local%20elections%2C%202006\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;.\nReforms as part of the Kallikratis plan.\nLocal administrative reform.\nThe Kallikratis Programme further reduced the number of &lt;a href=\"self-governance\"&gt;self-governing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"local%20administrative%20unit\"&gt;local administrative unit&lt;/a&gt;s by compulsory merging the 1033 &lt;a href=\"Municipalities%20and%20communities%20of%20Greece\"&gt;municipalities and communities&lt;/a&gt; which the Kapodistrias reform had already amalgamated to just 325 municipalities. Amalgamation of communities led to a number of pre-2007 &lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Greece\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; being reinstated as municipalities. Altogether, Greek municipalities now reached a mean size of 31,000 inhabitants, a level comparable to many other countries in the European Union.\nTo improve public transparency, local authorities are now generally obliged to make public all their decisions via the internet. Furthermore, a Local &lt;a href=\"Ombudsman\"&gt;Ombudsman&lt;/a&gt; was established to support both citizens and enterprises in coping with local administrations. New \"Financial Committees\" and \"Executive Committees\" were established to help professionalize financial accounting, and to monitor the local administrations. In communities with more than 10,000 residents, a \"Committee for the quality of life\" and a \"Consultation Committee\" is established. Aimed at improving local allocation of municipal resources, the \"Consultation Committee\" consists of representatives of local &lt;a href=\"Project%20stakeholder\"&gt;stakeholders&lt;/a&gt; such as businesses, trade unions, chambers and NGOs.\nRegional administrative reform.\nAt the same time the programme abolished the 51 self-governing &lt;a href=\"Prefectures%20of%20Greece\"&gt;prefectures&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"NUTS%203\"&gt;NUTS 3&lt;/a&gt;), leaving them only in place as &lt;a href=\"Regional%20units%20of%20Greece\"&gt;regional units&lt;/a&gt;. The former prefectures' competences were transferred to the 13 &lt;a href=\"NUTS%202\"&gt;NUTS 2&lt;/a&gt;-level &lt;a href=\"Administrative%20regions%20of%20Greece\"&gt;administrative regions&lt;/a&gt; (, \"Diikitiki periferia\" or \"administrative region\"). Originally introduced in 1987, the regions had been strengthened in 1993 as intermediate administrative units for &lt;a href=\"regional%20planning\"&gt;regional planning&lt;/a&gt;. Under the Kallikratis Programme, these regions became self-governing, separate entities with a regional council and a regional governor, both popularly elected.\nIn return, the central tasks of the national administration were transferred to seven larger, newly created \"decentralized administrations\" (, \"Apokendromeni Diikisi\"). Headed by a general secretary appointed by the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Interior%20%28Greece%29\"&gt;Minister of Interior&lt;/a&gt;, the decentralized administration is responsible for &lt;a href=\"regional%20planning\"&gt;regional planning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"environmental%20protection\"&gt;environmental protection&lt;/a&gt;.\nSubsequently, from &lt;a href=\"Greek%20local%20elections%2C%202010\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; on, subnational elections were held at the regional rather than the prefectural level, and from &lt;a href=\"Greek%20local%20elections%2C%202014\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt; on, they are held together with the &lt;a href=\"Elections%20to%20the%20European%20Parliament\"&gt;European Parliament elections&lt;/a&gt; for a five-year period.\nReactions.\nScholarly assessments.\nScholars of &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Europe\"&gt;Southern Europe&lt;/a&gt;an studies have described the Kallikratis reform as surprising, as it abolished a great number of prestigious and powerful political posts, which ahead of the looming crisis would have been regarded indispensable for keeping party &lt;a href=\"clientelism\"&gt;clientelism&lt;/a&gt; alive. Bertrana and Heinelt described the Papandreou government's decision as using a singular &lt;a href=\"%3Awikt%3Awindow%20of%20opportunity\"&gt;window of opportunity&lt;/a&gt; to overcome long-standing resistance against reform. While in regard to the massive-scale top-down approach deviating from a \"Southern European strategy\", compared to federal states such as &lt;a href=\"Federalism%20in%20Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, interaction between national and subnational levels remains relatively weak with the subnational levels remaining strictly separated from the deconcentrated administration of the central government. Also, state supervision remains largely confined to \"&lt;a href=\"A%20priori%20and%20a%20posteriori\"&gt;a posteriori&lt;/a&gt;\" control of the &lt;a href=\"legality\"&gt;legality&lt;/a&gt; of a subnational entity's activity.\nHoward Elcock suggested that in spite of all efforts, officialdom's reluctance makes securing transparency a continuing struggle, so the Greek citizen remained an \"administr\u00e9\" rather than a participant in government. Unnecessary decimation of local community organization led, in several occasions, to further minimization of participation. In the meantime, the hasty manner through which the law came into action paralyzed local authorities' initiative and independent funding.\nKallikratis and austerity.\nAkrivopoulou et al. pointed out that the Kallikratis program needs to be seen in the context of the general effort to create a smaller state. They point to specific provisions in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Economic%20Adjustment%20Programme%20for%20Greece\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and even more so in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Economic%20Adjustment%20Programme%20for%20Greece\"&gt;Second Memorandum&lt;/a&gt; concerning the role of local governance for overall austerity.\nNicos Souliotis pointed out that the Kallikratis plan fosters the transfer of &lt;a href=\"austerity\"&gt;austerity&lt;/a&gt; policies to the local administrations, as the devolution of responsibilities to the subnational levels has not been accompanied by the transfer of the financial resources required to fulfil the responsibilities."
