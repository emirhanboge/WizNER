    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"number%20theory\"&gt;number theory&lt;/a&gt;, the Elliott\u2013Halberstam conjecture is a &lt;a href=\"conjecture\"&gt;conjecture&lt;/a&gt; about the distribution of &lt;a href=\"prime%20number\"&gt;prime number&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"arithmetic%20progression\"&gt;arithmetic progression&lt;/a&gt;s. It has many applications in &lt;a href=\"sieve%20theory\"&gt;sieve theory&lt;/a&gt;. It is named for &lt;a href=\"Peter%20D.%20T.%20A.%20Elliott\"&gt;Peter D. T. A. Elliott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heini%20Halberstam\"&gt;Heini Halberstam&lt;/a&gt;, who stated the conjecture in 1968.\nStating the conjecture requires some notation. Let formula_1, the &lt;a href=\"prime-counting%20function\"&gt;prime-counting function&lt;/a&gt;, denote the number of primes less than or equal to formula_2. If formula_3 is a &lt;a href=\"negative%20and%20positive%20numbers\"&gt;positive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"integer\"&gt;integer&lt;/a&gt; and formula_4 is &lt;a href=\"coprime\"&gt;coprime&lt;/a&gt; to formula_3, we let formula_6 denote the number of primes less than or equal to formula_2 which are equal to formula_4 modulo formula_3. &lt;a href=\"Dirichlet%27s%20theorem%20on%20primes%20in%20arithmetic%20progressions\"&gt;Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions&lt;/a&gt; then tells us\nthat\nwhere formula_11 is &lt;a href=\"Euler%27s%20totient%20function\"&gt;Euler's totient function&lt;/a&gt;. If we then define the error function\nwhere the max is taken over all formula_4 coprime to formula_3, then the Elliott\u2013Halberstam conjecture is the assertion that\nfor every formula_15 and formula_16 there exists a constant formula_17 such that\nfor all formula_19.\nThis conjecture was proven for all formula_20 by &lt;a href=\"Enrico%20Bombieri\"&gt;Enrico Bombieri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A.%20I.%20Vinogradov\"&gt;A. I. Vinogradov&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Bombieri%E2%80%93Vinogradov%20theorem\"&gt;Bombieri\u2013Vinogradov theorem&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes known simply as \"Bombieri's theorem\"); this result is already quite useful, being an averaged form of the &lt;a href=\"generalized%20Riemann%20hypothesis\"&gt;generalized Riemann hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;. It is known that the conjecture fails at the endpoint formula_21.\nThe Elliott\u2013Halberstam conjecture has several consequences. One striking one is the result announced by &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Goldston\"&gt;Dan Goldston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A1nos%20Pintz\"&gt;J\u00e1nos Pintz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cem%20Y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1r%C4%B1m\"&gt;Cem Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m&lt;/a&gt;, which shows (assuming this conjecture) that there are infinitely many pairs of primes which differ by at most 16. In November 2013, &lt;a href=\"James%20Maynard%20%28mathematician%29\"&gt;James Maynard&lt;/a&gt; showed that subject to the Elliott\u2013Halberstam conjecture, one can show the existence of infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by at most 12. In August 2014, &lt;a href=\"Polymath%20Project\"&gt;Polymath&lt;/a&gt; group showed that subject to the &lt;a href=\"generalized%20Elliott%E2%80%93Halberstam%20conjecture\"&gt;generalized Elliott\u2013Halberstam conjecture&lt;/a&gt;, one can show the existence of infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by at most 6. Without assuming any form of the conjecture, the lowest proven bound is 246."
