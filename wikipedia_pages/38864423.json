    "text": "The Challenge Cup was an international competition for &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; clubs of the &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Empire&lt;/a&gt; that ran from 1897 to 1911.\nHistory.\nIt was invented in 1897 in &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"John%20Gramlick\"&gt;John Gramlick&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of the founders of &lt;a href=\"Vienna%20Cricket%20and%20Football-Club\"&gt;Vienna Cricket and Football-Club&lt;/a&gt;. The competition was open for all clubs in the &lt;a href=\"Austria-Hungary\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but practically all the participating teams came from the three major cities &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Budapest\"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prague\"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;. It was played in a &lt;a href=\"Single-elimination%20tournament\"&gt;knockout format&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe trophy was to be kept by the first team to win it in three consecutive seasons. In 1903 the rule was changed and the trophy is now in the possession of its last winner &lt;a href=\"Wiener%20Sport-Club\"&gt;Wiener Sport-Club&lt;/a&gt;. The Challenge Cup was ceased in 1911. Today it is seen as the predecessor to the &lt;a href=\"Austrian%20Cup\"&gt;Austrian Cup&lt;/a&gt; (first held in 1918) and the &lt;a href=\"Mitropa%20Cup\"&gt;Mitropa Cup&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1927."
