    "text": "Hiwan Golf Club is an 18-hole &lt;a href=\"golf%20course\"&gt;golf course&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Evergreen%2C%20Colorado\"&gt;Evergreen, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe golf course is 7,097 yards from the back tees and is a par 70. The fairways are lined with &lt;a href=\"ponderosa%20pines\"&gt;ponderosa pines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20fir\"&gt;Douglas fir&lt;/a&gt;s and magnificent Bergen Peak provides an elegant background for nearly every hole. The greens at Hiwan are difficult with oscillations in elevation and steep drops. There are two water holes at Hiwan; the par-4 Number 7 is 450 yards long with a large pond protecting the green and the par-3 Number 12 is the most picturesque hole with a series of waterfalls and three sculpted bunkers. There also is a large practice facility that operates in the summer with a driving range, chipping green and a spacious putting green.\nIt has a half-size Olympic sized pool, a water slide, 5 tennis courts, and locker rooms. The clubhouse was designed in the 1960s and has two restaurants: The Grill and the Hiwan Room. It also has a library, a pro shop and an exercise room with treadmill, elliptical, weights, and a weight machine.\nIn the winter, with nearly 120 annual inches of &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;, the course serves as a &lt;a href=\"cross-country%20ski\"&gt;cross-country ski&lt;/a&gt; area with three varying trails."
