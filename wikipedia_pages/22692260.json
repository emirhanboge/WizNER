    "text": "The 54th Infantry Division \"Napoli\" () was an &lt;a href=\"infantry\"&gt;infantry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Division%20%28military%29\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Italian%20Army\"&gt;Royal Italian Army&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The Napoli was formed on 15 April 1939 in &lt;a href=\"Caltanissetta\"&gt;Caltanissetta&lt;/a&gt; and named for the city of &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;. The division dissolved on 14 August 1943 in Melia southeast of &lt;a href=\"Scilla%2C%20Calabria\"&gt;Scilla, Calabria&lt;/a&gt; after being heavily decimated during the &lt;a href=\"Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily\"&gt;Allied invasion of Sicily&lt;/a&gt;. The division drafted men in southern &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt; and members of the division hailed from &lt;a href=\"Caltanissetta\"&gt;Caltanissetta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agrigento\"&gt;Agrigento&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syracuse%2C%20Sicily\"&gt;Syracuse&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding territories.\nThe 54th Infantry Division \"Napoli\" was one of three divisions, which recruited in &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt;. It mainly drafted men from southern Sicily and had its peacetime headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Caltanissetta\"&gt;Caltanissetta&lt;/a&gt;. It's two infantry regiments were based in &lt;a href=\"Syracuse%2C%20Sicily\"&gt;Syracuse&lt;/a&gt; (75th) and &lt;a href=\"Agrigento\"&gt;Agrigento&lt;/a&gt; (76th), while the division's artillery regiment was based in Caltanissetta. The 173rd CC.NN. Legion and CLXXIII CC.NN. Battalion were recruited in Caltanissetta and the CLXIX CC.NN. Battalion in Syracuse.\nHistory.\nThe division's lineage begins with the Brigade \"Granatieri di Napoli\" established on 15 April 1861 with the 5th and 6th grenadier regiments. On 5 March 1871 the brigade was assigned to the infantry and renamed Brigade \"Napoli\". On the same date brigade's two regiments were renamed 75th Infantry Regiment and 76th Infantry Regiment.\nWorld War I.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; the brigade fought initially on the &lt;a href=\"Italian%20front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Italian front&lt;/a&gt;, but in April 1918 it was transferred together with the &lt;a href=\"22nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BCacciatori%20delle%20Alpi%26quot%3B\"&gt;Brigade \"Alpi\"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"27th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BBrescia%26quot%3B\"&gt;Brigade \"Brescia\"&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"5th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BCosseria%26quot%3B\"&gt;Brigade \"Salerno\"&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29\"&gt;Western Front&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. There the brigades fought in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Battle%20of%20the%20Aisne\"&gt;Third Battle of the Aisne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Second%20Battle%20of%20the%20Marne\"&gt;Second Battle of the Marne&lt;/a&gt;, Battle of Saint-Thierry, and the &lt;a href=\"Hundred%20Days%20Offensive\"&gt;Hundred Days Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 18 November 1926 the brigade and the 76th Infantry Regiment \"Napoli\" were disbanded, while the 75th Infantry Regiment \"Napoli\" was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"29th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BPiemonte%26quot%3B\"&gt;XXIX Infantry Brigade&lt;/a&gt;. On 15 April 1939 the 54th Infantry Division \"Napoli\" was activated in &lt;a href=\"Caltanissetta\"&gt;Caltanissetta&lt;/a&gt;, which received the 75th Infantry Regiment \"Napoli\" from the &lt;a href=\"29th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BPiemonte%26quot%3B\"&gt;29th Infantry Division \"Piemonte\"&lt;/a&gt; and the 76th Infantry Regiment \"Napoli\" from the &lt;a href=\"28th%20Infantry%20Division%20%26quot%3BAosta%26quot%3B\"&gt;28th Infantry Division \"Aosta\"&lt;/a&gt;. On the same date the division received the reactivated the 54th Artillery Regiment, which was given the name \"Napoli\".\nWorld War II.\nIn 1940, the Napoli division was deployed in southern &lt;a href=\"Sicily\"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt;, with garrisons in &lt;a href=\"Caltagirone\"&gt;Caltagirone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piazza%20Armerina\"&gt;Piazza Armerina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirabella%20Imbaccari\"&gt;Mirabella Imbaccari&lt;/a&gt;. In 1941 it was re-deployed focusing on coastal defence in the area of &lt;a href=\"Pozzallo\"&gt;Pozzallo&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Gela\"&gt;Gela&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Licata\"&gt;Licata&lt;/a&gt;.\n In the anticipation of the &lt;a href=\"Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily\"&gt;Allied invasion of Sicily&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"XVI%20Army%20Corps%20%28Italy%29\"&gt;XVI Army Corps&lt;/a&gt; decided to split the division into two groups: one group placed at &lt;a href=\"Ramacca\"&gt;Ramacca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scordia\"&gt;Scordia&lt;/a&gt;, with the other group in &lt;a href=\"Palazzolo%20Acreide\"&gt;Palazzolo Acreide&lt;/a&gt;. Before the allied landings occurred, the division's headquarters at &lt;a href=\"Palazzolo%20Acreide\"&gt;Palazzolo Acreide&lt;/a&gt; was bombed by allied air forces on the night of 8 July 1943.\nOn the day of the Allied landings on 10 July 1943, the Napoli engaged in fighting south of &lt;a href=\"Noto\"&gt;Noto&lt;/a&gt;, while its northern group fought at &lt;a href=\"Lentini\"&gt;Lentini&lt;/a&gt; and . When British forces attacked &lt;a href=\"Floridia\"&gt;Floridia&lt;/a&gt; from the Ponte Diddino road, the Italian forces soon started to fail, despite heavy fighting on the mountaintop positions north of &lt;a href=\"Solarino\"&gt;Solarino&lt;/a&gt;. On the second day of the campaign, on 12 July 1943, the British captured &lt;a href=\"Floridia\"&gt;Floridia&lt;/a&gt; and the entirety of the 75th Infantry Regiment as it was attempting to withdraw from the town. Meanwhile, the division's southern group had made contact with an advancing battalion of the &lt;a href=\"Durham%20Light%20Infantry\"&gt;Durham Light Infantry&lt;/a&gt; on 12 July on the road between &lt;a href=\"Palazzolo%20Acreide\"&gt;Palazzolo Acreide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Floridia\"&gt;Floridia&lt;/a&gt;. Its attacks, using infantry and five tanks, were repelled by British artillery and anti-tank fire. By 12 July 1943, the division had managed to stabilize the front-line at &lt;a href=\"Palazzolo%20Acreide\"&gt;Palazzolo Acreide&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Solarino\"&gt;Solarino&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Priolo%20Gargallo\"&gt;Priolo Gargallo&lt;/a&gt;. By 13 July 1943, the new Allied landing north of &lt;a href=\"Augusta%2C%20Sicily\"&gt;Augusta&lt;/a&gt; outflanked the division, and inflicted heavy casualties. Destruction continued on 14 July 1943, as remnants of division fought a rear-guard battle at &lt;a href=\"Scordia\"&gt;Scordia&lt;/a&gt; to protect other units retreating from &lt;a href=\"Caltagirone\"&gt;Caltagirone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vizzini\"&gt;Vizzini&lt;/a&gt;. It has been estimated that the division lost up to eighty-percent of its effectiveness soon after its initial contact with British forces. The remnants of the Napoli Division were absorbed into the incoming &lt;a href=\"1st%20Fallschirm-Panzer%20Division%20Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring\"&gt;Panzer Division \"Hermann G\u00f6ring\"&lt;/a&gt;, with which they fought some small rearguard battles on 16\u201324 July 1943. On 25 July 1943, the Napoli division tried to reform at &lt;a href=\"Linguaglossa\"&gt;Linguaglossa&lt;/a&gt;, but it became apparent that its cut-off subunits had either been destroyed or captured by the Allies, so the attempt to reform was abandoned and the remaining personnel were ordered to &lt;a href=\"Messina\"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt;, from where it was evacuated to Southern Italy on 11\u201314 August 1943. The division was dissolved immediately after the evacuation had ended on 14 August 1943.\nOrganization.\nAttached to the division from 1941:\nCommanding officers.\nThe division's commanding officers were:"
