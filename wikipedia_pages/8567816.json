    "text": "Dhaka Residential Model College (also referred to as DRMC) (), formerly known as Residential Model School, is a public High School in &lt;a href=\"Mohammadpur%20Thana\"&gt;Mohammadpur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; established in 1960.\nThe college offers education for students ranging from &lt;a href=\"third%20grade\"&gt;third grade&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"twelfth%20grade\"&gt;twelfth grade&lt;/a&gt; (approximately ages 8 to 18). With over 5000 students, 1,000 of whom reside in its six houses (dormitories), DRMC the largest &lt;a href=\"Public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29\"&gt;residential and public school and college&lt;/a&gt; in the country.\nHistory.\nDhaka Residential Model College was established in 1960 by Pakistani President &lt;a href=\"Ayub%20Khan%20%28general%29\"&gt;Ayyub Khan&lt;/a&gt;, in an area of about 60 acre beside &lt;a href=\"Mirpur%20Road\"&gt;Mirpur Road&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Sher-e-Bangla%20Nagor\"&gt;Sher-e-Bangla Nagor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dhaka\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1962, the administration of DRMC was assumed by the provincial government of then East Pakistan.\nIn 1965, the government converted the institution into an autonomous body, and its administration was relegated to a board of governors with the Chief Secretary as its chairman. In 1967, the government again took control of the school. At that time, a new board of governors was constituted with the Education Secretary as its chairman.\nThe initial purpose of establishing DRMC was to provide education for elite army officers and high ranking government officials in East Pakistan. The school, and later the college, were modeled after public schools in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (according to the British Public Schools Act 1868), particularly &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton College&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe house system was designed to resemble Eton's. After the &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War\"&gt;independence of Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, a board of governors was appointed with the Education Secretary as its chairman. Since its inception, the school has been funded through government grants and fees from students. The Board of Governors has been empowered to \u201cframe rules as it deems necessary for the proper functioning of the school\u201d.\nThe school began with only one study session, known as the \"Morning shift\" which operates from 8:00\u00a0a.m. to 12:45\u00a0p.m. In March 1993, another session is known as the \"Day shift\" was added, according to the education expansion policy of the government, to cope with the growing number of students.\nThe day shift session operates from 1:00\u00a0p.m. to 5:45\u00a0p.m. Measures were taken to build a gymnasium, park, swimming pool, auditorium, mosque, administrative building, and residences for the principal, vice-principal, and school staff.\nThe school opened in eleventh and twelfth grades in 1967. In 1978, another dormitory named Lalon Shah House was built for students in grades 11\u201312. In 2008, a four-storied house named Dr. Muhammad Shahidullah was built for students of the day shift.\nAcademics.\nDhaka Residential Model College offers both primary and &lt;a href=\"secondary%20education\"&gt;secondary education&lt;/a&gt; and emphasizes student discipline in all of their activities. It has laboratories for &lt;a href=\"Physics\"&gt;Physics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chemistry\"&gt;Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Information%20and%20communications%20technology\"&gt;ICT&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Biology\"&gt;Biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathematics\"&gt;Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agriculture\"&gt;Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geography\"&gt;Geography&lt;/a&gt; and a library with more than 20,000 books, journals, newspapers, manuscripts and magazines. The &lt;a href=\"Year%23Academic%20year\"&gt;academic year&lt;/a&gt; is divided into two &lt;a href=\"academic%20term\"&gt;terms&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to a terminal exam, three class tests are held each term. Students have to sit for the &lt;a href=\"Secondary%20School%20Certificate\"&gt;Secondary School Certificate&lt;/a&gt; (SSC) examination at the end of the 10th grade, and the &lt;a href=\"Higher%20Secondary%20%28School%29%20Certificate\"&gt;Higher Secondary Certificate&lt;/a&gt; (HSC) at the end of the 12th grade. At the completion of the 5th grade, students have to sit for the Primary Education Completion Exam (PECE) examination program.\nStudents at the end of the 8th grade have the option to sit for the Junior School Certificate (JSC). The school employs about 200 teaching staff and 80 non-teaching staff. The student-teacher ratio is 20:1. Teachers occasionally attend training programs organized by different government institutions. The school had more training workshops for its teachers than any other neighboring cluster of schools in 2000, under the English Language Teaching Improvement Project, which is funded by the &lt;a href=\"British%20Government\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and Bangladeshi governments.\nAdmission.\nAlthough Dhaka Residential Model College operates from the 3rd through the 12th grade, it only admits students into the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 11th grades. Most competitive admission is for the students admitted in the 3rd grade.\nAdmission in the 3rd and 9th grades are based on admission tests. The admission tests for DRMC are highly competitive,with around 300 students accepted from around 20000 applicants for the 3rd grade. Students in these grades are admitted through written and &lt;a href=\"Test%20%28assessment%29\"&gt;Oral exam&lt;/a&gt; tests for both the morning and day shifts.\nStudents who pass the written test have to qualify for the viva exam. In addition to written and viva tests, candidates have to go through a &lt;a href=\"medical%20examination\"&gt;medical examination&lt;/a&gt; as well. Admission to the 11th grade is determined by a student's &lt;a href=\"grade%20point%20average\"&gt;grade point average&lt;/a&gt; (GPA) in the SSC examination. Many students with the highest grades in the SSC compete for admission as the school has limited enrollment in every grade.\nCurriculum.\nDhaka Residential Model College's curriculum includes traditional primary, secondary, and intermediate-level academic subjects. Students of primary classes take academic core subjects including Bengali, English, mathematics, social science, general science, arts and crafts, religion, and physical science. Students have to take agricultural science after completing their primary education.\nStudents of the secondary level have to elect one of the three major programs: Arts and Humanities; Business Studies; and Science. Students of the intermediate level (grades 11 and 12), have to select one of the three major programs as well. Students have some compulsory subjects and some optional subjects in each of the programs.\nCampus.\nDhaka Residential Model College is located on a 52 acre of green field. The campus is in northwest Dhaka at Mirpur Road, just opposite the official residence of the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Bangladesh\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith 20 buildings (including the newly built &lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20Shahidullah\"&gt;Dr. Muhammad Shahidullah&lt;/a&gt; House), six of which are dormitories, it is one of the largest residential colleges in the country.
