    "text": "Tryggvi \"the Pretender\" (&lt;a href=\"Old%20Norse\"&gt;Old Norse&lt;/a&gt; \"Tryggvi \u00d3lafsson\", &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20language\"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; \"Tryggve Olavsson\") was a &lt;a href=\"Vikings\"&gt;Viking&lt;/a&gt; chieftain who lived in the early eleventh century, and came from \"west across the sea\" (probably from the &lt;a href=\"Norsemen\"&gt;Norse&lt;/a&gt; settlements in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;). His story appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Heimskringla\"&gt;Heimskringla&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Snorri%20Sturluson\"&gt;Snorri Sturluson&lt;/a&gt;, the saga \"&lt;a href=\"Morkinskinna\"&gt;Morkinskinna&lt;/a&gt;\", and a saga composed by &lt;a href=\"Oddr%20Snorrason\"&gt;Oddr Snorrason&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20Tryggvason\"&gt;Olaf Tryggvason&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvasion of Norway.\nAccording to \"Heimskringla\", in 1033, during the lordship of &lt;a href=\"Cnut%20the%20Great\"&gt;Cnut the Great&lt;/a&gt;'s son &lt;a href=\"Svein%20Knutsson\"&gt;Svein&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, Tryggvi invaded Norway. He claimed to be the son of &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20Tryggvason\"&gt;Olaf Tryggvason&lt;/a&gt; and his wife Gyda. His enemies scoffed at this claim, asserting that Tryggvi was instead the &lt;a href=\"Legitimacy%20%28family%20law%29\"&gt;bastard&lt;/a&gt; son of a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;; however, &lt;a href=\"Snorri%20Sturluson\"&gt;Snorri Sturluson&lt;/a&gt; refers to Olaf's relatives in &lt;a href=\"Viken%2C%20Norway\"&gt;Viken&lt;/a&gt; as Tryggvi's \"kinsmen;\" moreover, the author of \"&lt;a href=\"Morkinskinna\"&gt;Morkinskinna&lt;/a&gt;\" has &lt;a href=\"Harald%20Hardrada\"&gt;Harald Hardrada&lt;/a&gt; asserting kinship with the then-deceased Tryggvi, indicating that at least some people believed Tryggvi's claim.\nWhen word reached Svein and his mother &lt;a href=\"%C3%86lfgifu%20of%20Northampton\"&gt;\u00c6lfgifu of Northampton&lt;/a&gt; that Tryggvi's invasion was imminent, they summoned the landholders of &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A5logaland\"&gt;H\u00e5logaland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Trondheim\"&gt;Trondheim&lt;/a&gt; district to join the royal army in resisting Tryggvi. The jarl &lt;a href=\"Einar%20Thambarskelfir\"&gt;Einar Thambarskelfir&lt;/a&gt;, angered by the policies of Cnut's government, remained at home and refused to fight for Svein. Likewise, neither the powerful landowner &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A1lfr%20%C3%81rnason\"&gt;K\u00e1lfr \u00c1rnason&lt;/a&gt; nor any of his brothers would fight for Svein.\nSvein and his forces made their way south to &lt;a href=\"Agder\"&gt;Agder&lt;/a&gt;, believing that Tryggvi would attempt to slip through the &lt;a href=\"Skagerrak\"&gt;Skagerrak&lt;/a&gt; and join his supporters in Viken. Tryggvi, however, landed instead in &lt;a href=\"Hordaland\"&gt;Hordaland&lt;/a&gt;, then sailed to &lt;a href=\"Rogaland\"&gt;Rogaland&lt;/a&gt; to attack Svein's navy. The two fleets met off the island of &lt;a href=\"Bokn\"&gt;Bokn&lt;/a&gt;, where only a few years before &lt;a href=\"Erling%20Skjalgsson\"&gt;Erling Skjalgsson&lt;/a&gt; had been defeated and killed.\nDuring the battle, according to reports recorded by Snorri, Tryggvi hurled &lt;a href=\"javelin\"&gt;javelin&lt;/a&gt;s at his enemies with both hands simultaneously, a feat for which Olaf Tryggvason had been known. He famously exclaimed \"Thus did my father teach me to say &lt;a href=\"Mass%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;,\" simultaneously asserting his descent from King Olaf and mocking his enemies' allegation that his father was a priest. Despite his celebrated resourcefulness, Tryggvi's forces were overwhelmed by Svein's fleet and Tryggvi himself was killed.\nAn account preserved in \"Morkinskinna\" relates that Tryggvi was actually killed by a farmer after the battle. Many years later, when Harald Hardrada was king of Norway, he passed by the site of the battle. The king met an old friend of his who pointed out the alleged assassin. After questioning the purported killer and hearing him confess, King Harald had the man &lt;a href=\"Hanging\"&gt;hanged&lt;/a&gt;, citing the familial bond between him and Tryggvi and his duty to avenge the latter's death.\n\"Heimskringla\".\nA famous poem, \"&lt;a href=\"Tryggvaflokkr\"&gt;Tryggvaflokkr&lt;/a&gt;\", was written about Tryggvi. Excerpts of the poem, usually attributed to Canute's court poet &lt;a href=\"Sighvat%20Thordarson\"&gt;Sighvat Thordarson&lt;/a&gt;, were preserved in \"Heimskringla\":\nAnother poem recorded in \"Heimskringla\", by an unknown &lt;a href=\"skald\"&gt;skald&lt;/a&gt;, mentions the battle against Tryggvi:"
