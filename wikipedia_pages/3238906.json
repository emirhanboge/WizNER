    "text": "Adelphia College was a &lt;a href=\"Swedish-American\"&gt;Swedish-American&lt;/a&gt; college in &lt;a href=\"Seattle\"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, run by the &lt;a href=\"Baptist%20General%20Conference\"&gt;Swedish Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt;. The institution opened in 1905, but went bankrupt in 1918 or 1919. \nIn 1919, the main building and campus were sold to the Jesuit &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20University\"&gt;Seattle College&lt;/a&gt; (the later &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20University\"&gt;Seattle University&lt;/a&gt;); the campus has since 1930 been used by a related Jesuit institution, the &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Preparatory%20School\"&gt;Seattle Preparatory School&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe remaining archives of the college are kept in the &lt;a href=\"Swenson%20Center\"&gt;Swenson Center&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Augustana%20College%20%28Illinois%29\"&gt;Augustana College (Illinois)&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdelphia Bible College\nIn 2011 the school reopened at Lake Retreat Camp and Conference Center in Ravensdale Washington as Adelphia Bible College (also known as Adelphia Bible School). Lake Retreat Camp is part of Converge Northwest &lt;a href=\"Baptist%20General%20Conference\"&gt;Swedish Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt;. The Bible school provides intentional, focused time exploring a student's strengths, identifying gifts and abilities, developing vital life skills, and equipping for faith and mission. Adelphia graduates may pursue further education at a university, some will enter the workforce, and many will devote their time in volunteer or vocational ministry."
