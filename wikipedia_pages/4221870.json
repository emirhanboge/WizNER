    "text": "Conan Christopher O'Brien (born April 18, 1963) is an American television host, comedian, writer, podcaster, and producer. He is best known for having hosted &lt;a href=\"late-night%20talk%20shows\"&gt;late-night talk shows&lt;/a&gt; for almost 28 years, beginning with \"&lt;a href=\"Late%20Night%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien\"&gt;Late Night with Conan O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;\" (1993\u20132009) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien\"&gt;The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;\" (2009\u20132010) on the &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; television network, and \"&lt;a href=\"Conan%20%28talk%20show%29\"&gt;Conan&lt;/a&gt;\" (2010\u20132021) on the cable channel &lt;a href=\"TBS%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;TBS&lt;/a&gt;. Before his hosting career, he was a writer for \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20Live\"&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/a&gt;\" (1988\u20131991) and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Simpsons\"&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;\" (1991\u20131993).\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Brookline%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Brookline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Massachusetts\"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, O'Brien was raised in an &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Catholic\"&gt;Irish Catholic&lt;/a&gt; family. He served as president of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Harvard%20Lampoon\"&gt;The Harvard Lampoon&lt;/a&gt;\" while attending &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;, and was a writer for the sketch comedy series \"&lt;a href=\"Not%20Necessarily%20the%20News\"&gt;Not Necessarily the News&lt;/a&gt;\". After writing for several comedy shows in Los Angeles, he joined the writing staff of \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20Live\"&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/a&gt;\". O'Brien was a writer and producer for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Simpsons\"&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;\" for two seasons until he was commissioned by &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; to take over &lt;a href=\"David%20Letterman\"&gt;David Letterman&lt;/a&gt;'s position as host of \"&lt;a href=\"Late%20Night%20%28NBC%29\"&gt;Late Night&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1993. A virtual unknown to the public, O'Brien's initial \"&lt;a href=\"Late%20Night%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien\"&gt;Late Night&lt;/a&gt;\" tenure received unfavorable reviews and remained on a multiweek renewal cycle during its early years. The show generally improved over time and was highly regarded by the time of his departure in 2009. Afterwards, O'Brien moved from New York to Los Angeles to host his own incarnation of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien\"&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/a&gt;\" for seven months until network politics prompted a &lt;a href=\"2010%20Tonight%20Show%20conflict\"&gt;host change&lt;/a&gt; in 2010. After this departure, O'Brien hosted a 32-city &lt;a href=\"The%20Legally%20Prohibited%20from%20Being%20Funny%20on%20Television%20Tour\"&gt;live comedy tour&lt;/a&gt;, which was the subject of the documentary, \"&lt;a href=\"Conan%20O%27Brien%20Can%27t%20Stop\"&gt;Conan O'Brien Can't Stop&lt;/a&gt;\". He then hosted \"Conan\" from 2010 to 2021. He has also hosted such events as the &lt;a href=\"Emmy%20Award\"&gt;Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt;s and \"&lt;a href=\"Christmas%20in%20Washington\"&gt;Christmas in Washington&lt;/a&gt;\".\nKnown for his spontaneous hosting style, which has been characterized as \"awkward, self-deprecating humor\", O'Brien's late-night programs combine the \"lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven short films (remotes)\". With the retirement of &lt;a href=\"David%20Letterman\"&gt;David Letterman&lt;/a&gt; on May 20, 2015, O'Brien became the longest-working late-night talk show host active in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. This active streak ended with O'Brien's retirement from late-night television in June 2021, with his entire run as a late-night host lasting almost 28 years. Conan was named one of &lt;a href=\"Time%20100\"&gt;\"Time\"s 100 Most Influential People&lt;/a&gt; in 2010.\nO'Brien is expected to launch a new show on &lt;a href=\"HBO%20Max\"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; in 2022.\nEarly life.\nO'Brien was born on April 18, 1963, in &lt;a href=\"Brookline%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Brookline, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. His father, Thomas Francis O'Brien (b. 1929), is a physician, &lt;a href=\"epidemiology\"&gt;epidemiologist&lt;/a&gt;, and professor of medicine at &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Medical%20School\"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;. His mother, Ruth O'Brien (n\u00e9e Reardon; b. 1931), is a retired attorney and former partner at the Boston firm &lt;a href=\"Ropes%20%26amp%3B%20Gray\"&gt;Ropes &amp; Gray&lt;/a&gt;. O'Brien has three brothers and two sisters.\nO'Brien attended &lt;a href=\"Brookline%20High%20School\"&gt;Brookline High School&lt;/a&gt;, where he served as the &lt;a href=\"managing%20editor\"&gt;managing editor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"student%20newspaper\"&gt;school newspaper&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sagamore%20%28Brookline%20High%20School%29\"&gt;The Sagamore&lt;/a&gt;\". In his second year, he was an intern for &lt;a href=\"Congressman\"&gt;Congressman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Drinan\"&gt;Robert Drinan&lt;/a&gt; and in his senior year, he won the &lt;a href=\"National%20Council%20of%20Teachers%20of%20English\"&gt;National Council of Teachers of English&lt;/a&gt; writing contest with his short story \"To Bury the Living\".\nAfter graduating as &lt;a href=\"valedictorian\"&gt;valedictorian&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, O'Brien entered Harvard University. He lived in &lt;a href=\"Holworthy%20Hall\"&gt;Holworthy Hall&lt;/a&gt; during his first year with future businessman &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Ubi%C3%B1as\"&gt;Luis Ubi\u00f1as&lt;/a&gt; and two other roommates, and in &lt;a href=\"Mather%20House%20%28Harvard%20University%29\"&gt;Mather House&lt;/a&gt; during his three upper-class years. He concentrated in History &amp; Literature, and graduated with a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Bachelor of Arts&lt;/a&gt; degree \"&lt;a href=\"magna%20cum%20laude\"&gt;magna cum laude&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1985. O'Brien's senior thesis, entitled \"Literary Progeria in the Works of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor\", concerned the use of children as symbols in the works of &lt;a href=\"William%20Faulkner\"&gt;William Faulkner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flannery%20O%27Connor\"&gt;Flannery O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;. During college, O'Brien briefly played drums in a band called the Bad Clams, was a writer for the \"&lt;a href=\"Harvard%20Lampoon\"&gt;Harvard Lampoon&lt;/a&gt;\" humor magazine, and developed a spoof of the video game ' in which the &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Celtics\"&gt;Boston Celtics&lt;/a&gt; play against a &lt;a href=\"classical%20ballet\"&gt;classical ballet&lt;/a&gt; troupe. During his sophomore and junior years, he served as the \"Lampoons president. At this time, O'Brien's future boss at &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Zucker\"&gt;Jeff Zucker&lt;/a&gt;, was serving as president of the school newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Harvard%20Crimson\"&gt;The Harvard Crimson&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCareer.\n\"Saturday Night Live\" (1988\u20131991).\nAfter graduating from Harvard, O'Brien moved to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; to join the writing staff of &lt;a href=\"Home%20Box%20Office\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Not%20Necessarily%20the%20News\"&gt;Not Necessarily the News&lt;/a&gt;\". He was also a writer on the short-lived \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wilton%20North%20Report\"&gt;The Wilton North Report&lt;/a&gt;\". He spent two years with that show and performed regularly with &lt;a href=\"improvisation\"&gt;improvisation&lt;/a&gt;al groups, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Groundlings\"&gt;The Groundlings&lt;/a&gt;. In January 1988, \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20Live\"&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/a&gt;\" (SNL) executive producer &lt;a href=\"Lorne%20Michaels\"&gt;Lorne Michaels&lt;/a&gt; hired O'Brien as a writer. During his three years on \"SNL\", he wrote such recurring sketches as \"Mr.\u00a0Short-Term memory\" and \"The Girl Watchers\"; the latter was first performed by &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Hanks\"&gt;Tom Hanks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Lovitz\"&gt;Jon Lovitz&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile on a writers' strike from \"Saturday Night Live\" following the 1987\u201388 season, O'Brien put on an &lt;a href=\"improvisational%20comedy\"&gt;improvisational comedy&lt;/a&gt; revue in Chicago with fellow \"SNL\" writers &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Odenkirk\"&gt;Bob Odenkirk&lt;/a&gt; and Robert Smigel called \"&lt;a href=\"Happy%20Happy%20Good%20Show\"&gt;Happy Happy Good Show&lt;/a&gt;\". While living in Chicago, O'Brien briefly roomed with &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Garlin\"&gt;Jeff Garlin&lt;/a&gt;. In 1989, O'Brien and his fellow \"SNL\" writers received an &lt;a href=\"Emmy%20Award\"&gt;Emmy Award&lt;/a&gt; for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy or Variety Series.\nO'Brien, like many \"SNL\" writers, occasionally appeared as an extra in sketches; his most notable appearance was as a doorman in a sketch in which &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Hanks\"&gt;Tom Hanks&lt;/a&gt; was inducted into the SNL \"&lt;a href=\"Five-Timers%20Club\"&gt;Five-Timers Club&lt;/a&gt;\" for hosting his fifth episode. O'Brien returned to host the show in 2001 during its 26th season. O'Brien and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Smigel\"&gt;Robert Smigel&lt;/a&gt; wrote the television pilot for \"&lt;a href=\"Lookwell\"&gt;Lookwell&lt;/a&gt;\" starring &lt;a href=\"Adam%20West\"&gt;Adam West&lt;/a&gt;, which aired on NBC in 1991. The pilot never went to series, but it became a &lt;a href=\"cult%20hit\"&gt;cult hit&lt;/a&gt;. It was later screened at \"The Other Network\", a festival of unaired TV pilots produced by &lt;a href=\"Un-Cabaret\"&gt;Un-Cabaret&lt;/a&gt;; it featured an extended interview with O'Brien and was rerun in 2002 on the &lt;a href=\"Trio%20%28TV%20network%29\"&gt;Trio&lt;/a&gt; network.\nIn 1991, O'Brien's engagement to be married was called off and \"Lookwell\" was not picked up. Burned out, he quit \"Saturday Night Live\". \"I told Lorne Michaels I couldn't come back to work and I just needed to do something else,\" O'Brien recalled. \"I had no plan whatsoever. I was literally in this big transition phase in my life where I decided, I'll just walk around New York City, and an idea will come to me.\"\n\"The Simpsons\" (1991\u20131993).\n&lt;a href=\"Mike%20Reiss\"&gt;Mike Reiss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Al%20Jean\"&gt;Al Jean&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"showrunner\"&gt;showrunner&lt;/a&gt;s of the animated sitcom \"The Simpsons\", called O'Brien and offered him a job. The series was prestigious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls \"everyone wanted to be on that show, but they never hired.\" O'Brien was one of the first hires after the show's original crew. With the help of old Groundlings friend, actor &lt;a href=\"Lisa%20Kudrow\"&gt;Lisa Kudrow&lt;/a&gt;, O'Brien purchased an apartment in &lt;a href=\"Beverly%20Hills\"&gt;Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;. He and Kudrow became involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing. O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was flattering him and asserting he was happy as a writer. In his speech given at Class Day at Harvard in 2000, O'Brien credited \"The Simpsons\" with saving him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing before being hired for the show.\nFrom 1991 to 1993, O'Brien was a writer and producer for \"The Simpsons\". When O'Brien first arrived at the Fox lot, they temporarily gave him writer &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Martin%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Jeff Martin&lt;/a&gt;'s office. O'Brien was nervous and self-conscious, feeling that he would embarrass himself in front of what he regarded as an intimidating collection of writers. O'Brien would pitch characters in their voices, as he thought that was the norm, until Reiss informed him that no one did this. He fit in quickly, commanding control of the room frequently; writer &lt;a href=\"Josh%20Weinstein\"&gt;Josh Weinstein&lt;/a&gt; called it a \"ten-hour Conan show, nonstop\". According to John Ortved, one of his fellow writers said that Conan had been a shoo-in to take over as showrunner.\nO'Brien wrote some of the series' most acclaimed episodes: \"&lt;a href=\"Marge%20vs.%20the%20Monorail\"&gt;Marge vs. the Monorail&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Homer%20Goes%20to%20College\"&gt;Homer Goes to College&lt;/a&gt;\". The show was initially a highly realistic family sitcom; after O'Brien's debut, the show took a rapid shift in the direction of the surreal. O'Brien also has sole writing credits on \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Kid%20on%20the%20Block\"&gt;New Kid on the Block&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20IV\"&gt;Treehouse of Horror IV&lt;/a&gt;\", on which he wrote the episode &lt;a href=\"Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20IV%23Production\"&gt;wraparounds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wallace%20Wolodarsky\"&gt;Wallace Wolodarsky&lt;/a&gt; described a \"room character\" Conan put on for the writers: \"Conan used to do this thing called the Nervous Writer that involved him opening a can of &lt;a href=\"Diet%20Coke\"&gt;Diet Coke&lt;/a&gt; and then nervously pitching a joke. He would spray Diet Coke all over himself, and that was always a source of endless amusement among us.\" During his time at \"The Simpsons\", O'Brien also had a side project working with Smigel on the script for a musical film based on the \"&lt;a href=\"Hans%20and%20Franz\"&gt;Hans and Franz&lt;/a&gt;\" sketch from \"Saturday Night Live\", but the film was never produced.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"David%20Letterman\"&gt;David Letterman&lt;/a&gt; was preparing to leave the talk show \"&lt;a href=\"Late%20Night%20%28franchise%29\"&gt;Late Night&lt;/a&gt;\", prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels to search for a new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent &lt;a href=\"Gavin%20Polone\"&gt;Gavin Polone&lt;/a&gt; stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tonight%20Show\"&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Alexander\"&gt;Jason Alexander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mimi%20Rogers\"&gt;Mimi Rogers&lt;/a&gt; were the guests, and the audience was composed of \"Simpsons\" writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: \"Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn't ever imagine actually happening.\" The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched.\nO'Brien was picked as the new host of \"Late Night\" on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for \"Homer Goes to College\", O'Brien received a phone call from Polone informing him of the decision. \"He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet,\" recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. \"I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'\" Fox, however, would not let O'Brien out of his contract. Eventually, NBC and O'Brien split the cost to get him out of the contract. After O'Brien's departure, the writers at \"The Simpsons\" would watch videotaped episodes of \"Late Night\" at lunch the day following their midnight broadcast and analyze them.\n\"Late Night\" (1993\u20132009).\n\"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", originating from Studio 6A at &lt;a href=\"30%20Rockefeller%20Plaza\"&gt;30 Rockefeller Plaza&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, premiered on September 13, 1993, to unfavorable reviews from contemporary critics. This reception was not completely unsurprising; O'Brien wrote a self-deprecating \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" piece titled \"O'Brien Flops!\" on the day of the show's premiere. Critics attacked O'Brien: &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Shales\"&gt;Tom Shales&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" suggested that \"the host resume his previous identity, Conan O'Blivion.\" Generally, critics viewed O'Brien as nervous and fidgety on-camera, and that he was \"too smart, too East Coast, too sophisticated, too young and even too tall to be successful.\" The show was constantly at risk for cancellation; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to put him on a week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Kinnear\"&gt;Greg Kinnear&lt;/a&gt;, who followed O'Brien with \"&lt;a href=\"Later%20%28talk%20show%29\"&gt;Later&lt;/a&gt;\" at 1:30\u00a0am. Interns filled empty seats in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts. In one installment after a short stretch of reruns, sidekick &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Richter\"&gt;Andy Richter&lt;/a&gt; described his vacation activities as follows: \"I sat back and reminded myself what it's like to be unemployed.\" The in-joke alluded to the rumors floating in the trades that NBC was near canceling the program.\n\"Late Night\" under O'Brien slowly but steadily acquired commercial and critical success. Banter between O'Brien and Richter improved, and sketches grew in popularity (\"If They Mated\", \"Desk Drive\", \"In the Year 2000\"). A reliable staple involved a TV screen, lowered behind O'Brien's desk and displaying a still photo of a news figure. The lips and voice of these characters \u2013 frequently a party-crazed hillbilly interpretation of &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 were supplied by writing partner &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Smigel\"&gt;Robert Smigel&lt;/a&gt;. A turning point was David Letterman's February 1994 appearance. \"It was a morale boost,\" said O'Brien. \"I'm thinking, If the guy who created the 12:30 thing comes on and says we're smart and funny, let's go.\" The show went through a wobble in January 1995 when Robert Smigel, feeling burned out, quit as head writer. The show's quality improved slowly over time, and most credit O'Brien's growing comedic performance. Within a year, a comedic formula began to arise: the show would combine the lewd and wacky with a more elegant, narrative-driven remotes. Regular characters would typically include a \"Masturbating Bear\" and a famous remote found Conan visit a historic, Civil War-era baseball league. That piece was one of O'Brien's personal favorites, later remarking, \"When I leave this earth, at the funeral, just show this, because this pretty much says who I'm all about.\"\nO'Brien's audience, largely young and male (a coveted demographic), grew steadily and the show began to best competitors in the ratings, which it would continue to do for 15 seasons. In the early days of the Internet, fans launched unofficial websites, compiling precise summaries of each episode. Even Tom Shales was a convert: he called the show \"one of the most amazing transformations in television history.\" Beginning in 1996, O'Brien and the \"Late Night\" writing team were nominated annually for the &lt;a href=\"Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Writing%20for%20a%20Variety%2C%20Music%20or%20Comedy%20Program%23Outstanding%20Writing%20for%20a%20Variety%2C%20Music%20or%20Comedy%20Program\"&gt;Emmy Award for Best Writing in a Comedy or Variety Series&lt;/a&gt;, winning the award for the first and only time in 2007. In 1997, 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004, he and the \"Late Night\" writing staff won the &lt;a href=\"Writers%20Guild%20of%20America\"&gt;Writers Guild Award&lt;/a&gt; for Best Writing in a Comedy/Variety Series. In 2001, he formed his own television production company, &lt;a href=\"Conaco\"&gt;Conaco&lt;/a&gt;, which subsequently shared in the production credits for \"Late Night\".\n, \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" had for eleven years consistently attracted an audience averaging about 2.5\u00a0million viewers. The apotheosis of the \"Late Night\" remotes centered on the realization, in 2006, that O'Brien bore a striking resemblance to &lt;a href=\"Tarja%20Halonen\"&gt;Tarja Halonen&lt;/a&gt;, entering her second term as president of &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. Capitalizing on the resemblance and on the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Finnish%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2006 Finnish presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, O'Brien and \"Late Night\" aired mock political ads both in support of Halonen and against her main opponent, which influenced popular perception of the race, and traveled to Finland shortly after the election. \"We took the show to &lt;a href=\"Helsinki\"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; for five days,\" O'Brien recalled, \"where we were embraced like a national treasure.\" As part the five-day trip, which was released as a one-hour special episode of \"Late Night\", O'Brien met with Halonen at the Finnish &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20Palace%2C%20Helsinki\"&gt;Presidential Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike\"&gt;writers' strike&lt;/a&gt; in 2008, O'Brien staged a &lt;a href=\"Who%20Made%20Huckabee%3F\"&gt;mock feud&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Comedy%20Central\"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Stewart\"&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/a&gt; (of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Show\"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/a&gt;\") and &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Colbert\"&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/a&gt; (of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Colbert%20Report\"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;\") over a dispute about which of the three were responsible for giving a \"bump\" to &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Huckabee\"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign to become the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; presidential nominee. This feud crossed over all three shows during the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike\"&gt;2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn February 20, 2009, NBC aired the last episode of \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\". The show consisted of a compilation of previous \"Late Night\" clips and included a surprise appearance by former sidekick Andy Richter. &lt;a href=\"Will%20Ferrell\"&gt;Will Ferrell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Mayer\"&gt;John Mayer&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"White%20Stripes\"&gt;White Stripes&lt;/a&gt; also appeared. O'Brien ended the episode by destroying the set with an axe, handing out the pieces of the set to the audience, and thanking a list of people who helped him get to that point in his career. Among those thanked were Lorne Michaels, David Letterman, &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Leno\"&gt;Jay Leno&lt;/a&gt;, and O'Brien's wife and children.\nIn 2019, clips from O'Brien's time on \"Late Night\" began to appear on his TBS website and on the Team Coco YouTube Channel.\n\"The Tonight Show\" (2009\u20132010).\nO'Brien hosted \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tonight%20Show\"&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/a&gt;\" for more than seven months in 2009 and 2010. As part of a new contract negotiated with &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, the network decided that O'Brien would take over \"The Tonight Show\" from &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Leno\"&gt;Jay Leno&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. Hosting \"The Tonight Show\" was a lifelong dream of O'Brien's, and the promise of succeeding Leno kept him in NBC's employ despite the fact that he likely could have secured a more lucrative deal at another network. O'Brien was a guest on Jay Leno's final episode of \"The Tonight Show\". On June 1, 2009, &lt;a href=\"Will%20Ferrell\"&gt;Will Ferrell&lt;/a&gt; became Conan's first \"Tonight Show\" guest on the couch and &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20Jam\"&gt;Pearl Jam&lt;/a&gt; appeared as his first musical guest.\nConan acquired the nickname \"Coco\" after its use in the first \"Twitter Tracker\" sketch during the second episode of his \"Tonight Show\" run. Guest Tom Hanks used the nickname during his subsequent interview, even getting the audience to chant it. In reaction to the &lt;a href=\"moniker\"&gt;moniker&lt;/a&gt;, Conan remarked to Hanks in jest, \"If that catches on, I'll sue you.\"\nDuring the taping of the Friday, September 25, 2009, episode of \"The Tonight Show\", O'Brien suffered from a mild concussion after he slipped and hit his head while running a race as part of a comedy sketch with guest &lt;a href=\"Teri%20Hatcher\"&gt;Teri Hatcher&lt;/a&gt;. He was examined at a hospital and released the same day. A rerun was aired that night, but O'Brien returned to work the following Monday and poked fun at the incident.\nBy January 2010, O'Brien's ratings for \"The Tonight Show\" were much lower than they had been when the show was hosted by Jay Leno. On January 7, 2010, NBC executive Jeff Zucker met with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien to discuss how to move Leno out of prime time, where his ratings were lackluster, and back into late night. It was proposed that O'Brien would remain as host of \"The Tonight Show\", which would run at 12:05\u00a0am with Leno hosting a 30-minute show at 11:35\u00a0pm. Three days later, &lt;a href=\"NBC%20Universal\"&gt;NBC Universal&lt;/a&gt; Television Entertainment chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jay%20Leno%20Show\"&gt;The Jay Leno Show&lt;/a&gt;\" would be moved to 11:35\u00a0pm following NBC's coverage of the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Winter%20Olympics\"&gt;2010 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.\nSources familiar with the situation told the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Post\"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;\" that O'Brien was unhappy with NBC's plan. On January 12, O'Brien released this statement: \"I sincerely believe that delaying \"The Tonight Show\" into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. \"The Tonight Show\" at 12:05 simply isn't \"The Tonight Show.\"\" On January 21, 2010, it was announced that Conan had reached a deal with NBC that would see him exit \"The Tonight Show\" the next day. The deal also granted him $45\u00a0million, of which $12\u00a0million was designated for distribution to his staff, who had moved with Conan to Los Angeles from New York when he left \"Late Night\".\nThe final \"Tonight Show\" with Conan aired January 22, 2010, and featured guests &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Hanks\"&gt;Tom Hanks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Carell\"&gt;Steve Carell&lt;/a&gt; (who did an exit interview and shredded Conan's &lt;a href=\"ID%20badge\"&gt;ID badge&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Young\"&gt;Neil Young&lt;/a&gt; (singing \"&lt;a href=\"Long%20May%20You%20Run\"&gt;Long May You Run&lt;/a&gt;\"), and &lt;a href=\"Will%20Ferrell\"&gt;Will Ferrell&lt;/a&gt;. For Ferrell's appearance, Conan played guitar with the band and Ferrell sang \"&lt;a href=\"Free%20Bird\"&gt;Free Bird&lt;/a&gt;\" while reprising his \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Night%20Live\"&gt;SNL&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"more%20cowbell\"&gt;cowbell&lt;/a&gt;. Ferrell's wife, &lt;a href=\"Viveca%20Paulin\"&gt;Viveca Paulin&lt;/a&gt;, together with &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Harper\"&gt;Ben Harper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beck\"&gt;Beck&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ZZ%20Top\"&gt;ZZ Top&lt;/a&gt; guitarist &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Gibbons\"&gt;Billy Gibbons&lt;/a&gt;, also joined the band for this final performance.\nJay Leno returned to \"The Tonight Show\" following NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. Under the $45\u00a0million deal with NBC, Conan was allowed to start working for another network as soon as September 2010. Conan's rumored next networks ranged from Fox to &lt;a href=\"Comedy%20Central\"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/a&gt;. Other networks reportedly interested in O'Brien included &lt;a href=\"TNT%20%28U.S.%20TV%20network%29\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"HBO\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"FX%20%28TV%20channel%29\"&gt;FX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Showtime%20%28TV%20network%29\"&gt;Showtime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Revision3\"&gt;Revision3&lt;/a&gt;, and even the &lt;a href=\"NBC%20Universal\"&gt;NBC Universal&lt;/a&gt;\u2013owned &lt;a href=\"USA%20Network\"&gt;USA Network&lt;/a&gt;.\nTelevision hiatus.\nOn February 8, 2010, it was reported that O'Brien was attempting to sell his &lt;a href=\"Central%20Park%20West\"&gt;Central Park West&lt;/a&gt; penthouse in New York with an asking price of $35\u00a0million. He had purchased the apartment in 2007 for $10\u00a0million. Two years earlier, O'Brien had purchased a home in the &lt;a href=\"Brentwood%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Brentwood&lt;/a&gt; section of Los Angeles for over $10.5\u00a0million. Some industry insiders have speculated that O'Brien had chosen to stay on the west coast in order to facilitate a return to late night television and because he did not want to put his children through another move.\nO'Brien was included in the 2010 &lt;a href=\"Time%20100\"&gt;\"Time\" 100&lt;/a&gt;, a list compiled by \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;\" of the 100 most influential people in the world as voted on by readers. After being prohibited from making television appearances of any kind until May, O'Brien spoke about the \"Tonight Show\" conflict on the &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; newsmagazine \"&lt;a href=\"60%20Minutes\"&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;\" on May 2, 2010. During the interview with &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Kroft\"&gt;Steve Kroft&lt;/a&gt;, O'Brien said the situation felt \"like a marriage breaking up suddenly, violently, quickly. And I was just trying to figure out what happened.\" He also said he \"absolutely\" expected NBC to give him more of a chance and that, if in Jay Leno's position, he would not have come back to \"The Tonight Show\". However, Conan said he did not feel unfortunate. \"It's crucial to me that anyone seeing this, if they take anything away from this, it's I'm fine. I'm doing great,\" said O'Brien. \"I hope people still find me comedically absurd and ridiculous. And I don't regret anything.\"\nOn March 11, 2010, O'Brien announced via his Twitter account that he would embark on a 30-city live tour beginning April 12, 2010, entitled, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legally%20Prohibited%20from%20Being%20Funny%20on%20Television%20Tour\"&gt;The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour&lt;/a&gt;\". Co-host &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Richter\"&gt;Andy Richter&lt;/a&gt;, along with members of the former &lt;a href=\"The%20Legally%20Prohibited%20Band\"&gt;Tonight Show Band&lt;/a&gt;, joined O'Brien on the tour. &lt;a href=\"Max%20Weinberg\"&gt;Max Weinberg&lt;/a&gt;, however, was not able to join, except for a guest appearance at one of Conan's New York City shows.\nOn April 12, 2010, O'Brien opened his two-month comedy tour in &lt;a href=\"Eugene%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Eugene, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, with a crowd of 2,500 and no TV cameras. The tour traveled through America's Northwest and Canada before moving on to larger cities, including Los Angeles and New York City, where he performed on the campuses that house both of the NBC-owned studios he formerly occupied. The tour ended in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; on June 14.\n\"Conan\" (2010\u20132021).\nThe day his live tour began, O'Brien announced that he would host a new show on cable station &lt;a href=\"TBS%20%28American%20TV%20channel%29\"&gt;TBS&lt;/a&gt;. The show, &lt;a href=\"Conan%20%28talk%20show%29\"&gt;\"Conan\"&lt;/a&gt;, debuted on November 8, 2010, and aired Monday through Thursday at 11:00\u00a0pm ET/10:00\u00a0pm CT. O'Brien's addition moved \"&lt;a href=\"Lopez%20Tonight\"&gt;Lopez Tonight&lt;/a&gt;\" with &lt;a href=\"George%20Lopez\"&gt;George Lopez&lt;/a&gt; back one hour. Refusing at first to do to Lopez what had happened to him at NBC, O'Brien agreed to join the network after Lopez called to persuade him to come to TBS.\nIn February 2015, following the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Cuban%20Thaw\"&gt;Cuban Thaw&lt;/a&gt;, O'Brien became the first American television personality to film in &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; for more than half a century. Conan O'Brien then visited &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;. In April 2016, O'Brien visited &lt;a href=\"South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; in response to a fan letter urging him to visit, as well as a growing fan base online. His visit included a trip to the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Demilitarized%20Zone\"&gt;Korean Demilitarized Zone&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in O'Brien and &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Yeun\"&gt;Steven Yeun&lt;/a&gt; to also visit &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; on a technicality by stepping across the border line at the &lt;a href=\"Korean%20Demilitarized%20Zone\"&gt;DMZ&lt;/a&gt;. Conan commented on the significance during the sketch, claiming, \"The idea that you and I could be in North Korea, talking and communicating freely, seems like kind of a cool message.\"\nTBS extended the show through 2018 in 2014 and through 2022 in 2017.\nIn the fall of 2018, \"Conan\" took a hiatus while O'Brien launched another national comedy tour. The show returned January 22, 2019, in a new half-hour format without the live band.\nIn November 2020, TBS announced that \"Conan\" would end in June 2021. The final show aired on June 24, 2021. It was announced that O'Brien will move to a weekly untitled variety show on fellow &lt;a href=\"WarnerMedia\"&gt;WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt; property &lt;a href=\"HBO%20Max\"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, where he is expected to focus more on his podcast and travel shows with a relaxed production schedule. On his final show, O'Brien featured fictional character &lt;a href=\"Homer%20Simpson\"&gt;Homer Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, marking also the three episodes that O'Brien wrote for the series. Comedians &lt;a href=\"Will%20Ferrell\"&gt;Will Ferrell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Black\"&gt;Jack Black&lt;/a&gt; also paid their farewell to the show in the series finale.\n\"Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend\" (2018\u2013present).\nIn 2018, O'Brien's production company, TeamCoco, partnered with &lt;a href=\"Earwolf\"&gt;Earwolf&lt;/a&gt; to launch his own weekly podcast, \"&lt;a href=\"Conan%20O%27Brien%20Needs%20a%20Friend\"&gt;Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend&lt;/a&gt;\". The podcast debuted November 18, 2018, with &lt;a href=\"Will%20Ferrell\"&gt;Will Ferrell&lt;/a&gt; as the first guest. The title of the podcast refers to the premise that O'Brien is lonely and is thus inviting people onto the show to see if they could be his actual friend. In each episode, Conan is joined by his guest, as well as his assistant &lt;a href=\"Sona%20Movsesian\"&gt;Sona Movsesian&lt;/a&gt; and the show's producer &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Gourley\"&gt;Matt Gourley&lt;/a&gt;. Guests on the podcast have included &lt;a href=\"Barack%20Obama\"&gt;Barack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michelle%20Obama\"&gt;Michelle Obama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Colbert\"&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Newhart\"&gt;Bob Newhart&lt;/a&gt; among others.

After six episodes and low ratings, the show was canceled despite being named one of the Top Ten Shows of 2007 by \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\". Later, &lt;a href=\"USA%20Network\"&gt;USA Network&lt;/a&gt; handed out a 90-minute, cast-contingent pilot order to the medical-themed \"Operating Instructions\" from O'Brien's production banner; O'Brien served as an executive producer through his &lt;a href=\"Conaco\"&gt;Conaco&lt;/a&gt; label.

O'Brien and Powel have a daughter, Neve (born 2003) and a son, Beckett (born 2005).\nO'Brien often affirms his &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Catholic\"&gt;Irish Catholic&lt;/a&gt; heritage. On a 2009 episode of \"&lt;a href=\"Inside%20the%20Actors%20Studio\"&gt;Inside the Actors Studio&lt;/a&gt;\", he stated that ancestors from both sides of his family moved to America from Ireland starting in the 1850s, subsequently marrying only other Irish Catholics, and that his lineage is thus 100% Irish Catholic.\nHe has been a registered &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; since casting his first vote for president in 1984 for &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Mondale\"&gt;Walter Mondale&lt;/a&gt;.

O'Brien founded the anti-hunger organization \"Labels Are For Jars\" with his friend and former Harvard dormmate Father Paul B. O'Brien. He also helped open the \"Cor Unum\" meal center in 2006.\nIn January 2008, after his show was put on hold for two months owing to the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike\"&gt;strike by the Writers Guild of America&lt;/a&gt;, he reemerged on late-night TV sporting a &lt;a href=\"beard\"&gt;beard&lt;/a&gt;, which guest &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Brokaw\"&gt;Tom Brokaw&lt;/a&gt; described as making him look like \"a draft dodger from the Civil War.\" After leaving \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien\"&gt;The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2010, O'Brien again grew a beard, which he kept until May 2011, when it was partially shaved on the set of \"&lt;a href=\"Conan%20%28talk%20show%29\"&gt;Conan&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Will%20Ferrell\"&gt;Will Ferrell&lt;/a&gt; (and completely shaved off-screen by a professional barber).\nO'Brien purchased a $10.5-million mansion in &lt;a href=\"Brentwood%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Brentwood, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, California, to prepare for his move there in 2009 from New York City to host \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tonight%20Show\"&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/a&gt;\" at &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Studios%20Hollywood\"&gt;Universal Studios Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;. As part of a long-running gag, he brought his 1992 &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Taurus%20SHO\"&gt;Ford Taurus SHO&lt;/a&gt; with him to California, showcasing it on both the inaugural episodes of \"The Tonight Show\" and \"Conan\".\nOn June 12, 2011, O'Brien was awarded an honorary &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Doctor of Arts&lt;/a&gt; degree from &lt;a href=\"Dartmouth%20College\"&gt;Dartmouth College&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn October 21, 2011, O'Brien was ordained as a minister by the &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Life%20Church%20Monastery\"&gt;Universal Life Church Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him to perform a same-sex marriage while back in New York, then one of the few states in the US where gay marriage was legal, to tape a week's worth of shows. The wedding, between a member of O'Brien's staff and his partner, was held on the stage of the &lt;a href=\"Beacon%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29\"&gt;Beacon Theatre&lt;/a&gt; on November 3, 2011, and broadcast on \"Conan\".\nStalker.\nStarting in September 2006, O'Brien was &lt;a href=\"Stalking\"&gt;stalked&lt;/a&gt; by Father David Ajemian of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Boston\"&gt;Archdiocese of Boston&lt;/a&gt;, who, despite multiple warnings to stop, sent O'Brien letters signed as \"your priest stalker\". Ajemian later sent O'Brien death threats and tried to forcefully enter a taping of \"Late Night\" before being arrested. On April 8, 2008, Ajemian pleaded guilty to stalking, and was later &lt;a href=\"Loss%20of%20clerical%20state%20%28Catholic%20Church%29\"&gt;laicized&lt;/a&gt;."
