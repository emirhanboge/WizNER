The club's home ground is the &lt;a href=\"La%C3%A7i%20Stadium\"&gt;La\u00e7i Stadium&lt;/a&gt; which has a seated capacity of 2,300\nUnder the ownership of local businessman and club president &lt;a href=\"Pashk%20Laska\"&gt;Pashk Laska&lt;/a&gt; La\u00e7i has established itself as a top-half &lt;a href=\"Kategoria%20Superiore\"&gt;Kategoria Superiore&lt;/a&gt; side since being promoted back to the division in 2009, with their highest-ever finish coming in the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20Kategoria%20Superiore\"&gt;2013\u201314 Kategoria Superiore&lt;/a&gt; season where they finished third.

They reached the championship final of the 1974\u201375 Second Division, but lost to &lt;a href=\"KF%20Himara\"&gt;Vet\u00ebtima Himar\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; and were subsequently not promoted to the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt;. The name was changed to \"KS La\u00e7i\" in 1991 when the club first participated in the &lt;a href=\"Kategoria%20Superiore\"&gt;Kategoria Superiore&lt;/a&gt;, the name was changed for the last time to \"KF La\u00e7i\" in 1997. The first trophy won by the club was the 2008\u201309 &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20First%20Division\"&gt;Albanian First Division&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Altin%20Cuko\"&gt;Altin Cuko&lt;/a&gt; is the only La\u00e7i player to have won the &lt;a href=\"Kategoria%20Superiore\"&gt;Kategoria Superiore&lt;/a&gt; Golden Boot whilst still playing for the club. This was achieved in the 1995\u201396 season where KF La\u00e7i finished in 12th place, out of 18. Cuko had already scored 5 goals for &lt;a href=\"FK%20Tomori%20Berat\"&gt;Tomori Berat&lt;/a&gt; before moving to KF La\u00e7i in January 1996, where he netted another 16 times to give him the Golden boot with a total of 21 goals throughout the entire season with both Tomori and La\u00e7i.\nKategoria Superiore era.\nThe club played their first season at the top tier, the &lt;a href=\"Kategoria%20Superiore\"&gt;Kategoria Superiore&lt;/a&gt;, in the 2004-05 season. They relegated back to the First Division after just one &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20KF%20La%C3%A7i%20season\"&gt;season&lt;/a&gt;, setting many records along the way. They returned to the Kategoria Superiore in 2009 and brought in new players such as &lt;a href=\"Erjon%20Vucaj\"&gt;Erjon Vucaj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arlind%20Nora\"&gt;Arlind Nora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Brahja\"&gt;Julian Brahja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emiliano%20%C3%87ela\"&gt;Emiliano \u00c7ela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emiliano%20Veliaj\"&gt;Emiliano Veliaj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ervin%20Llani\"&gt;Ervin Llani&lt;/a&gt;.

After spending the early stages of the season in the relegation zone, the club hit form and finished in fourth place head of more established clubs such as &lt;a href=\"Flamurtari%20Vlor%C3%AB\"&gt;Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"KF%20Vllaznia%20Shkod%C3%ABr\"&gt;Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr&lt;/a&gt;, which also meant they qualified for Europe for the first time in the club's history.\nAhead of the 2010\u201311 season the club brought in new players in order to build upon their fourth-place finish the previous season as well attempt to go through to the next round of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;.

However, the second leg proved to be a failure as the club was sent crashing out of the competition following a 7\u20131 loss, with &lt;a href=\"Valdan%20Nimani\"&gt;Valdan Nimani&lt;/a&gt; scoring the only goal for the club. Following their exit from Europe, the club brought in players such as &lt;a href=\"Elton%20Doku\"&gt;Elton Doku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vangjel%20Mile\"&gt;Vangjel Mile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stipe%20Buljan\"&gt;Stipe Buljan&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the &lt;a href=\"Kategoria%20Superiore\"&gt;Kategoria Superiore&lt;/a&gt; campaign in order to build upon their fourth-place finish the previous season.\nThe club defeated &lt;a href=\"FK%20Kuk%C3%ABsi\"&gt;FK Kuk\u00ebsi&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20131 in the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Albanian%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2015 Albanian Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; to win the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Cup\"&gt;Albanian Cup&lt;/a&gt; for a second time, meaning they qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;.\nManagement.\nThe club appointed current manager &lt;a href=\"Stavri%20Nica\"&gt;Stavri Nica&lt;/a&gt; on 7 July 2006, ahead of the 2006\u201307 season in the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20First%20Division\"&gt;Albanian First Division&lt;/a&gt;. The owner of the club Pashk Laska revealed the new manager at the club's &lt;a href=\"Stadiumi%20La%C3%A7i\"&gt;Stadiumi La\u00e7i&lt;/a&gt; in front of a considerable number of fans. Nica has guided the club to promotion to the top tier of Albanian football and won the &lt;a href=\"Albanian%20First%20Division\"&gt;Albanian First Division&lt;/a&gt; title in the 2008\u201309 season. La\u00e7i made their best finish in the Kategoria Superiore in the 2009\u201310 season; where they finished 4th and qualified for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Europa%20League\"&gt;UEFA Europa League&lt;/a&gt;.\nStadium.\nThe club plays its home games at the purpose built &lt;a href=\"La%C3%A7i%20Stadium\"&gt;La\u00e7i Stadium&lt;/a&gt; located in the centre of &lt;a href=\"La%C3%A7\"&gt;La\u00e7&lt;/a&gt;, which has an official seated capacity of 2,300, but attendances have reached 4,000 in recent years.\nThe stadium was renovated following the club's promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Kategoria%20Superiore\"&gt;Kategoria Superiore&lt;/a&gt; and further work was carried out when in the summer of 2010 as they qualified for Europe for the first time in their history. La\u00e7i had hoped that they would be able to host their home &lt;a href=\"Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt; at their own stadium, but they were not able to complete the reconstruction in time, meaning their first home European tie against &lt;a href=\"FC%20Dnepr%20Mogilev\"&gt;Dnepr Mogilev&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Belarus\"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; was held at the &lt;a href=\"Niko%20Dovana%20Stadium\"&gt;Niko Dovana Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durr%C3%ABs\"&gt;Durr\u00ebs&lt;/a&gt;. During the reconstruction, the three stands surrounding the playing field were renovated and around 2,300 blue plastic seats were installed to turn the stadium into an all seater. The newly renovated stadium was inaugurated in a home league game against &lt;a href=\"Shkumbini%20Peqin\"&gt;Shkumbini Peqin&lt;/a&gt; on 30 August 2010 in front of 1,500 spectators, where La\u00e7i won 2\u20130. During the summer of 2015 the stadium's turf was replaced for the first time since 2006, and minor cosmetic renovation was carried out throughout the rest of the stadium.\nEuropean competitions record.\nLa\u00e7i first qualified for European play after a very good 2009\u201310 domestic campaign in which they finished 4th to earn a place in the &lt;a href=\"Europa%20League\"&gt;Europa League&lt;/a&gt;. The club's first ever European game was played on 1 July 2010 at the &lt;a href=\"Stadiumi%20Niko%20Dovana\"&gt;Stadiumi Niko Dovana&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durr%C3%ABs\"&gt;Durr\u00ebs&lt;/a&gt;.

Although La\u00e7i had the lesser of the chances and only had 2 goal attempts in the match, they still led for much of the second half through a goal by youngster Bledar Marashi in injury time in the first half. However Dnepro equalised in the 92nd minute through &lt;a href=\"Dmitri%20Turlin\"&gt;Dmitri Turlin&lt;/a&gt; which ruined a dream European debut for La\u00e7i.\nHonours.\n&lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Cup\"&gt;Albanian Cup&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Albanian%20Supercup\"&gt;Albanian Supercup&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Kategoria%20e%20Par%C3%AB\"&gt;Kategoria e Par\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Kategoria%20e%20Dyt%C3%AB\"&gt;Kategoria e Dyt\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;\nRecords.\n\"Albanian records from September 1997\"\nRecords.\nBelow is the list with top ten players with most appearances in all competitions for KF La\u00e7i."
