    "text": "Fran\u00e7ois-Saturnin Lascaris d'Urf\u00e9, S.S. (1641 \u2013 June 30, 1701) was a &lt;a href=\"French%20people\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sulpician\"&gt;Sulpician&lt;/a&gt; priest known as the first resident &lt;a href=\"pastor\"&gt;pastor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"parish\"&gt;parish&lt;/a&gt; of Saint-Louis-du-Haut-de-l'\u00cele (in what is now the town of &lt;a href=\"Baie-D%27Urf%C3%A9\"&gt;Baie-D'Urf\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;) on the &lt;a href=\"Island%20of%20Montreal\"&gt;Island of Montreal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20France\"&gt;New France&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife and career.\nBorn to a prominent French noble family, Lascaris d'Urf\u00e9 was a brother of Louis Lascaris d'Urf\u00e9, &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; of Sommaviva, whose son was Louis Lascaris d'Urf\u00e9, &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20of%20Limoges\"&gt;Bishop of Limoges&lt;/a&gt;. He held the title of &lt;a href=\"Marquis\"&gt;Marquis&lt;/a&gt; de Baug\u00e9 and was also &lt;a href=\"Abb%C3%A9\"&gt;Abb\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ard%C3%A8che\"&gt;Ard\u00e8che&lt;/a&gt;. In 1660, he was admitted to the seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, and ordained in 1665. He was sent as a missionary to &lt;a href=\"New%20France\"&gt;New France&lt;/a&gt; in 1668. \nIn 1669, he accompanied his cousin, &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Salignac%20de%20la%20Mothe-F%C3%A9nelon%20%28missionary%29\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois de Salignac de la Mothe-F\u00e9nelon&lt;/a&gt;, to the Iroquois mission at &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Edward%20County%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Kent\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, on Lake Ontario. In 1672, Fenelon was to establish an Algonquin mission on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ville-Marie\"&gt;Ville-Marie&lt;/a&gt; at a place called &lt;a href=\"Dorval\"&gt;Gentilly&lt;/a&gt;. Lascaris d'Urf\u00e9 replaced his cousin there in 1674. His support for F\u00e9nelon gave rise to his own problems with &lt;a href=\"Louis%20de%20Buade%20de%20Frontenac\"&gt;Governor Frontenac&lt;/a&gt;. He accompanied back to France, where he wrote to Minister of Finance &lt;a href=\"Jean-Baptiste%20Colbert\"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Colbert&lt;/a&gt;, whose daughter-in-law was Lascaris d'Urf\u00e9's first cousin, of his mail being opened and other slights.\nLascaris d'Urf\u00e9 returned to Quebec in 1686, and soon after re-joined the Sulpicians at Montreal. He then founded the mission of Saint-Louis-du-Haut-de-l'\u00cele in the west end of Montreal Island at Pointe-Caron (site of the present-day Baie-D'Urf\u00e9 Yacht Club). It was a small community of settlers, soldiers, traders, and Indians. At that time, the mission included the entire area from the tip of Montreal Island to Pointe-Claire, \u00cele Perrot, Soulanges, Vaudreuil, and \u00cele aux Tourtes. The mission was attacked by the Iroquois in 1687. The town of &lt;a href=\"Baie-D%27Urf%C3%A9\"&gt;Baie-D'Urf\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; is named after l'Abb\u00e9 d'Urf\u00e9.\nAfter serving in Canada for 19 years, he returned to Paris in 1687 to deal with family matters. He was later appointed as the &lt;a href=\"Dean%20%28religion%29\"&gt;Dean&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Le%20Puy%20Cathedral\"&gt;Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Puy-en-Velay\"&gt;Puy-en-Velay&lt;/a&gt;, France. Lascaris d'Urf\u00e9 retired to his ch\u00e2teau of Baug\u00e9, where he died in 1701."
