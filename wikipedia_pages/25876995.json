She began her career as a &lt;a href=\"soprano\"&gt;soprano&lt;/a&gt; when she was only 13, but later retrained her voice as a &lt;a href=\"mezzo-soprano\"&gt;mezzo-soprano&lt;/a&gt;. She sang in several world premieres, but is most remembered today for having created the role of Mistress Quickly in &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Verdi\"&gt;Giuseppe Verdi&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Falstaff%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Falstaff&lt;/a&gt;\". The composer wrote the role specifically for her and dedicated the act 2 aria \"Giunta all' albergo\" to Pasqua. She was married to the &lt;a href=\"baritone\"&gt;baritone&lt;/a&gt; Astorre Giacomelli.\nBiography.\nGiuseppina Pasqua was born in &lt;a href=\"Perugia\"&gt;Perugia&lt;/a&gt; to a prosperous family.

She was still singing soprano roles when she made her &lt;a href=\"La%20Scala\"&gt;La Scala&lt;/a&gt; debut on 1 September 1872 as \u00c4nnchen in &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber\"&gt;Weber&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Der%20Freisch%C3%BCtz\"&gt;Der Freisch\u00fctz&lt;/a&gt;\".\nShe then studied with &lt;a href=\"Luigia%20Abbadia\"&gt;Luigia Abbadia&lt;/a&gt; in Milan to retrain her voice as a mezzo-soprano.
