    "text": "The Kingdom of Abkhazia (; lit. \"Kingdom of the Abkhazians\"), also known as Abasgia or Egrisi-Abkhazia, was a &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"feudalism\"&gt;feudal&lt;/a&gt; state in the &lt;a href=\"Caucasus\"&gt;Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; which was established in the 780s. Through dynastic succession, it was united in 1008 with the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20the%20Iberians\"&gt;Kingdom of the Iberians&lt;/a&gt;, forming the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;Kingdom of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; sources record that in the early years of the 10th century Abkhazia stretched three hundred &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greece\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; miles along the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast, from the frontiers of the \"&lt;a href=\"Theme%20%28Byzantine%20district%29\"&gt;thema&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Chaldia\"&gt;Chaldia&lt;/a&gt; to the mouth of the river &lt;a href=\"Nicopsis\"&gt;Nicopsis&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Caucasus\"&gt;Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; behind it.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nAbkhazia, or &lt;a href=\"Abasgoi\"&gt;Abasgia&lt;/a&gt; of classic sources, was a &lt;a href=\"Principality\"&gt;princedom&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; authority. It lay chiefly along the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; coast in what is now the northwestern part of the modern-day &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; (disputed Republic of &lt;a href=\"Abkhazia\"&gt;Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt;) and extended northward into the territory of today's &lt;a href=\"Krasnodar%20Krai\"&gt;Krasnodar Krai&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. It had &lt;a href=\"New%20Athos\"&gt;Anacopia&lt;/a&gt; as its capital. Abkhazia was ruled by a hereditary \"&lt;a href=\"archon\"&gt;archon&lt;/a&gt;\" who effectively functioned as a Byzantine viceroy. The country was chiefly &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Pitsunda\"&gt;Pityus&lt;/a&gt; was a seat of an &lt;a href=\"archbishop\"&gt;archbishop&lt;/a&gt; directly subordinated to the &lt;a href=\"Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople\"&gt;Patriarch of Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;. Another Abasgian episcopal see was that of &lt;a href=\"Soterioupolis\"&gt;Soterioupolis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 735, a large expedition led by &lt;a href=\"Arabs\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; general &lt;a href=\"Marwan%20II\"&gt;Marwan&lt;/a&gt; was launched against the Georgian kingdoms. The Arabs, pursuing the retreating Georgian princes \u2013 brothers &lt;a href=\"Mirian%20of%20Kakheti\"&gt;Mirian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archil%20of%20Kakheti\"&gt;Archil&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 surged into Abkhazia in 736. &lt;a href=\"Dysentery\"&gt;Dysentery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flood\"&gt;flood&lt;/a&gt;s, combined with a stubborn resistance offered by the archon &lt;a href=\"Leon%20I%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Leon I&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Principality%20of%20Iberia\"&gt;Iberian&lt;/a&gt; and Lazic allies, made the invaders retreat. Leon I then married Mirian's daughter, and a successor, &lt;a href=\"Leon%20II%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Leon II&lt;/a&gt; exploited this dynastic union to acquire &lt;a href=\"Lazica\"&gt;Lazica&lt;/a&gt; in the 770s. Presumably considered as a &lt;a href=\"Succession%20of%20states\"&gt;successor state&lt;/a&gt; of Lazica (\"Egrisi,\" in Georgian sources), this new polity continued to be referred to as Egrisi (Lazica) in some contemporary Georgian (e.g., \"The Vitae of the Georgian Kings\" by &lt;a href=\"Leonti%20Mroveli\"&gt;Leonti Mroveli&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;n (e.g., \"The History of Armenia\" by &lt;a href=\"Hovhannes%20Draskhanakerttsi\"&gt;Hovannes Draskhanakertsi&lt;/a&gt;) chronicles.\nEstablishment and consolidation.\nThe successful defense against the Arabs, and new territorial gains, gave the Abkhazian princes enough power to claim more autonomy from the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Towards circa 778, &lt;a href=\"Leon%20II%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Leon II&lt;/a&gt; won his full independence with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Khazars\"&gt;Khazars&lt;/a&gt;; he assumed the title of \"\"&lt;a href=\"Divan%20of%20the%20Abkhazian%20Kings\"&gt;King of the Abkhazians&lt;/a&gt;\"\" and transferred his capital to the western Georgian city of &lt;a href=\"Kutaisi\"&gt;Kutaisi&lt;/a&gt;. According to Georgian annals, Leon subdivided his kingdom into eight duchies: &lt;a href=\"Abasgoi\"&gt;Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt; proper, &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Tskhumi\"&gt;Tskhumi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabediano\"&gt;Bedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guria\"&gt;Guria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Racha\"&gt;Racha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lechkhumi\"&gt;Takveri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Svaneti\"&gt;Svaneti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argveti\"&gt;Argveti&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kutaisi\"&gt;Kutatisi&lt;/a&gt;. During his reign Abkhazian kingdom was at the stage of the state building and was less active in the matter of spreading the borders of the kingdom to the East. After obtaining of the state independence, the matter of the church independence became the main problem. In the early 9th century &lt;a href=\"Catholicate%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Abkhazian Church&lt;/a&gt; broke away from &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt; and recognized the authority of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20heads%20of%20the%20Georgian%20Orthodox%20Church%23Catholicoi%20of%20Kartli%20%28467%E2%80%931010%29\"&gt;Catholicate of Mtskheta&lt;/a&gt;; language of the church in Abkhazia shifted from &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20language\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt;, as Byzantine power decreased and doctrinal differences disappeared.\nThe most prosperous period of the Abkhazian kingdom was between 850 and 950. Beginning with &lt;a href=\"George%20I%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;George I&lt;/a&gt; (864 \u2013 871), the increasingly expansionist tendencies of the kingdom led to the enlargement of its realm to the east. The Abkhazian kings controlled &lt;a href=\"duchy%20of%20Kartli\"&gt;duchy of Kartli&lt;/a&gt; (central and part of eastern Georgia), and interfered in the affairs of the &lt;a href=\"Armenia\"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;n and Georgian &lt;a href=\"Bagrationi%20dynasty\"&gt;Bagratids&lt;/a&gt;. In about 908 King &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20III%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Constantine III&lt;/a&gt; (894 \u2013 923) had finally annexed a significant portion of Kartli, bringing his borders close to the &lt;a href=\"Emirate%20of%20Tbilisi\"&gt;Arab-controlled Tbilisi&lt;/a&gt;. For a brief period of time, &lt;a href=\"First%20Kingdom%20of%20Kakheti\"&gt;Kakheti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Hereti\"&gt;Hereti&lt;/a&gt; in eastern Georgia also recognized the Abkhazian suzerainty. Constantine III also tried to extend his influence over &lt;a href=\"Alania\"&gt;Alania&lt;/a&gt; by supporting their &lt;a href=\"Christianization\"&gt;Christianization&lt;/a&gt;. Under his son, &lt;a href=\"George%20II%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;George II&lt;/a&gt; (923 \u2013 957), the Abkhazian Kingdom reached a climax of power and prestige. George was also known as a promoter of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox Christianity&lt;/a&gt; and a patron of Georgian Christian culture. He helped to establish Christianity as an official religion in &lt;a href=\"Alania\"&gt;Alania&lt;/a&gt;, winning the thanks of &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;. The contemporary Georgian annals knew him as a \"builder of churches\". George's successors, however, were unable to retain the kingdom's strength and integrity. During the reign of &lt;a href=\"Leon%20III%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Leon III&lt;/a&gt; (960\u2013969), Kakheti and Hereti emancipated themselves from the Abkhazian rule. A bitter &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; and feudal revolts which began under &lt;a href=\"Demetrius%20III%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Demetrius III&lt;/a&gt; (969\u2013976) led the kingdom into complete anarchy under the unfortunate &lt;a href=\"Theodosius%20III%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Theodosius III the Blind&lt;/a&gt; (975 \u2013 978), a weak and inauspicious king.\nUnification.\nBy that time the hegemony in &lt;a href=\"South%20Caucasus\"&gt;Transcaucasia&lt;/a&gt; had finally passed to the Georgian &lt;a href=\"Bagrationi%20dynasty\"&gt;Bagratids&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bagratid%20Iberia\"&gt;Tao-Klarjeti&lt;/a&gt;. In 978, the Bagratid prince &lt;a href=\"Bagrat%20III%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;Bagrat&lt;/a&gt;, nephew (sister's son) of the heirless Theodosius, occupied the Abkhazian throne with the help of his adoptive father &lt;a href=\"David%20III%20of%20Tao\"&gt;David III of Tao&lt;/a&gt;. Bagrat's descent from both Bagratid and Abkhazian dynasties made him an acceptable choice for the nobles of the realm who were growing weary of internecine quarrels. In 1008, Bagrat succeeded on the death of his natural father &lt;a href=\"Gurgen%20of%20Iberia\"&gt;Gurgen&lt;/a&gt; as the \"King of the Iberians\". Thus, these two kingdoms unified through dynastic succession, in practice laying the foundation for the unified Georgian monarchy, officially styled then as the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;Kingdom of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.\nRulers.\nMost Abkhazian kings, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"John%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adarnase%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Adarnase&lt;/a&gt; of the Shavliani (presumably of &lt;a href=\"Svans\"&gt;Svan&lt;/a&gt; origin), came from the dynasty which is sometimes known in modern history writing as the Leonids after the first king Leon, or Anosids, after the prince Anos from whom the royal family claimed their origin. Prince &lt;a href=\"Cyril%20Toumanoff\"&gt;Cyril Toumanoff&lt;/a&gt; relates the name of Anos to the later Abkhaz noble family of &lt;a href=\"Anchabadze\"&gt;Anchabadze&lt;/a&gt;. By convention, the regnal numbers of the Abkhazian kings continue from those of the &lt;a href=\"archon\"&gt;archon&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Abasgoi\"&gt;Abasgia&lt;/a&gt;. There is also some lack of consistency about the dates of their reigns. The chronology below is given as per Toumanoff.\nHistoriographical conundrum.\nWriting the kingdom's primary history was dominated by &lt;a href=\"Georgians\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; sources supported by modern epigraphic and archaeological records.\nThe problem of the Abkhazian Kingdom, particularly the questions of the nature of its ruling family and its ethnic composition, is a major point of controversy between modern Georgian and Abkhaz scholars. This can be largely explained by the scarcity of primary sources on these issues. Many Georgian historians as well as other historians agree, that the formation of kingdom of Abkhazia was due to the unification of tribes such as &lt;a href=\"Misimians\"&gt;Misimians&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;a href=\"Proto-Kartvelian%20language\"&gt;Proto-Kartvelian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Svans\"&gt;Svan&lt;/a&gt; tribe) &lt;a href=\"Sanigs\"&gt;Sanigs&lt;/a&gt;(Proto-Kartvelian &lt;a href=\"Mingrelians\"&gt;Zan&lt;/a&gt;/Svan tribe), &lt;a href=\"Apsilae\"&gt;Apsilaes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abasgoi\"&gt;Abasgoi&lt;/a&gt;. In the VII-VIII centuries, during the period of the weakening of Kingdom of Egrisi, the principality of Abazgia was strengthened, which united the already mentioned tribes. Georgian sources call the unification of these tribes Abkhazians, therefore term Abkhazian wasn't used as description of one specific nation but the unification of &lt;a href=\"Georgians\"&gt;Kartvelian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Caucasian%20languages\"&gt;Northwest Caucasian&lt;/a&gt; tribes. This is objected to on the side of the Abkhazian historians, Most Abkhaz historians claim the kingdom was formed as a result of the consolidation of the early &lt;a href=\"Abkhazians\"&gt;Abkhaz tribes&lt;/a&gt; that enabled them to extend their dominance over the neighboring areas.\nMost international scholars agree that it is extremely difficult to judge the ethnic identity of the various population segments due primarily to the fact that the terms \"Abkhazia\" and \"Abkhazians\" were used in a broad sense during this period\u2014and for some while later\u2014and covered, for all practical purposes, all the population of the kingdom, comprising both the Georgian (including also &lt;a href=\"Mingrelians\"&gt;Mingrelians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laz%20people\"&gt;Laz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Svans\"&gt;Svans&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Kartvelian%20languages\"&gt;their distinct languages&lt;/a&gt; that are related to the &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20language\"&gt;Georgian language&lt;/a&gt;) and possible modern Abkhaz (&lt;a href=\"Abasgoi\"&gt;Abasgoi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apsilae\"&gt;Apsilae&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zygii\"&gt;Zygii&lt;/a&gt;) peoples. It seems likely that a significant (if not predominant) proportion of the Georgian-speaking population, combined with a drive of the Abkhazian kings to throw off the Byzantine political and cultural dominance, resulted in Georgian replacing &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; as the language of literacy and culture."
