In 1972, his family moved back to &lt;a href=\"Zaje%C4%8Dar\"&gt;Zaje\u010dar&lt;/a&gt;, where he finished high school. He studied at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Belgrade%20Faculty%20of%20Law\"&gt;Belgrade Law School&lt;/a&gt;, and later obtained his degree from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Ni%C5%A1\"&gt;University of Ni\u0161&lt;/a&gt;.\nNini\u0107 spent his career working for Zaje\u010dar Brewery, finishing as CEO in 2007.\nHe started writing relatively late in life, as a side activity to his business career. He published his first novel, The Revelation, in 2003. By 2010, it had sold several thousand copies, in four editions.\nNini\u0107 published his second novel, The Revelation 2 (Serbian:\"Saznanje\"), in 2007, with a second edition appearing in 2010. His third novel, The Revelation 3 (Serbian:\"Spoznaja\"), was published in 2010.\nNini\u0107's novels are mostly philosophical and political texts, in a manner that draws on &lt;a href=\"magic%20realism\"&gt;magical realism&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandrian syncretism, special war theories and neuro-linguistic programming. In his writing, Nini\u0107 manages not only to combine these disparate theories but prove the connections they share as well. The author does so through the dialogues among the characters who inhabit these fantastic novels \u2014 \u201cin order for the reader to accept and understand them in an easier way,\u201d Nini\u0107 himself explains."
