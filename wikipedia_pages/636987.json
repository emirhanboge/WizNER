    "text": "The Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead is a &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20borough\"&gt;metropolitan borough&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"metropolitan%20county\"&gt;metropolitan county&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tyne%20and%20Wear\"&gt;Tyne and Wear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20East%20England\"&gt;North East England&lt;/a&gt;. It includes &lt;a href=\"Gateshead\"&gt;Gateshead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rowlands%20Gill\"&gt;Rowlands Gill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Whickham\"&gt;Whickham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blaydon\"&gt;Blaydon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryton%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear\"&gt;Ryton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felling%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Felling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelaw\"&gt;Pelaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunston%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear\"&gt;Dunston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Low%20Fell\"&gt;Low Fell&lt;/a&gt;. The borough forms part of the &lt;a href=\"Tyneside\"&gt;Tyneside&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"conurbation\"&gt;conurbation&lt;/a&gt;, centred on &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne\"&gt;Newcastle upon Tyne&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is bordered by the local authorities areas of &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne\"&gt;Newcastle upon Tyne&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Northumberland\"&gt;Northumberland&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"County%20Durham\"&gt;County Durham&lt;/a&gt; to the south, the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Sunderland\"&gt;City of Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; to the south-east, and &lt;a href=\"South%20Tyneside\"&gt;South Tyneside&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nHistory.\nThe district has some 201,000 inhabitants and is located within the &lt;a href=\"Historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;historic county boundaries&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"County%20Durham\"&gt;County Durham&lt;/a&gt;. It is south of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Tyne\"&gt;River Tyne&lt;/a&gt;, the historic county boundary between &lt;a href=\"Northumberland\"&gt;Northumberland&lt;/a&gt; and Durham. The metropolitan borough was formed in 1974 through the merger of the &lt;a href=\"county%20borough\"&gt;county borough&lt;/a&gt; of Gateshead with the &lt;a href=\"Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29\"&gt;urban district&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Felling%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear\"&gt;Felling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Whickham\"&gt;Whickham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blaydon\"&gt;Blaydon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ryton%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear\"&gt;Ryton&lt;/a&gt; and part of &lt;a href=\"Chester-le-Street%20Rural%20District\"&gt;Chester-le-Street Rural District&lt;/a&gt;, with the borough placed in the new metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. In 1986 Tyne and Wear county council was abolished, with the borough of Gateshead becoming a &lt;a href=\"unitary%20authority\"&gt;unitary authority&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere were originally two &lt;a href=\"civil%20parishes%20in%20England\"&gt;civil parishes&lt;/a&gt; in Gateshead - &lt;a href=\"Birtley%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear\"&gt;Birtley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lamesley\"&gt;Lamesley&lt;/a&gt;, both from the Chester-le-Street RD. Birtley Town Council and parish were abolished on 1 April 2006.\nGovernance.\nParliamentary constituencies.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Politics%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;national government&lt;/a&gt; the borough contains two parliamentary constituencies, &lt;a href=\"Gateshead%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Gateshead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blaydon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Blaydon&lt;/a&gt;. The Gateshead constituency covers the centre and east of the borough. The MP, first elected in 2010, is &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Mearns\"&gt;Ian Mearns&lt;/a&gt;. The Blaydon constituency covers the west of the borough and Birtley to the south. It is represented by &lt;a href=\"Liz%20Twist\"&gt;Liz Twist&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Jarrow%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Jarrow&lt;/a&gt; constituency takes in the very eastern tip of the borough, including &lt;a href=\"Pelaw\"&gt;Pelaw&lt;/a&gt;. It is represented by &lt;a href=\"Kate%20Osborne\"&gt;Kate Osborne&lt;/a&gt;.\nCouncillors.\nIn total there are 22 electoral wards in the borough, each of which elects three councillors. The wards are:\nGateshead Council is Labour controlled. In total there are 54 Labour councillors and 12 Lib Dem councillors. In general, the Whickham area along with Low Fell tend to favour the Liberal Democrats. Pelaw, Ryton and Dunston Hill are more evenly matched between the two parties, and the rest of the borough is dominated by Labour, especially the East. UKIP were able to get 23% of the vote in Winlaton and High Spen in 2016, while the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201989%29\"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; have one of their few strongholds in Birtley, where they once held. The Conservatives rarely get more than 10%, polling best in Bridges and Saltwell wards; both of these have large Jewish communities.\nGeneral.\nGateshead has hosted two major political conferences. The first of these was Labour's spring conference, ahead of the &lt;a href=\"2005%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20election\"&gt;2005 general election&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; also held a conference at the Sage Gateshead in March 2008. The Conservatives do not have any councillors in Gateshead and at the time only had one MP in the whole of the north east region. That conference was seen as an attempt to connect to voters in the area.\nEducation.\nGateshead has a number of schools across the borough at both primary and secondary level. Results are well above average, with a number of outstanding schools. Indeed, Gateshead has amongst the best primary and secondary schools in the country overall. A range of schools are present in Gateshead, including &lt;a href=\"Judaism\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20England\"&gt;Church of England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Methodist\"&gt;Methodist&lt;/a&gt; and non-religious state schools. There is one &lt;a href=\"independent%20school%20%28UK%29\"&gt;independent school&lt;/a&gt; in the borough, Chase school in Whickham. Further independent schools can be found in Newcastle, Sunderland and Tynedale.\nGateshead town itself has a &lt;a href=\"further%20education\"&gt;further education&lt;/a&gt; college, &lt;a href=\"Gateshead%20College\"&gt;Gateshead College&lt;/a&gt;, and a leading Jewish &lt;a href=\"higher%20education\"&gt;higher education&lt;/a&gt; institution.\nEnvironment.\nGateshead has a variety of landscapes, urban and industrial areas include the town itself, Whickham and Blaydon in the west, with more semi-rural and rural locations in the west including Ryton and Rowlands Gill. Overall though, it is a fairly green area with over half of the borough being &lt;a href=\"green%20belt\"&gt;green belt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"countryside\"&gt;countryside&lt;/a&gt;. Most of this is located away from built up &lt;a href=\"Tyneside\"&gt;Tyneside&lt;/a&gt; to the south of the borough into Derwentside/Chester-le-Street and to the west into Tynedale.\nIn total, there are over twenty countryside sites in the borough, from ancient meadows and woodland to local nature reserves.\nNotable features of Gateshead's countryside include Ryton Willows, found at Old Ryton Village on the banks of the Tyne at Ryton. Ryton Willows is 43 hectares of locally rare grassland and ponds located near to an affluent village with &lt;a href=\"Georgian%20era\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; houses. Because of this it is a &lt;a href=\"Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest\"&gt;Site of Special Scientific Interest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Derwent Valley, in the south/south west of the borough, offers panoramic views and pleasant walks. It was in the Derwent Valley, near Rowlands Gill, that the Northern Kites Project re-introduced &lt;a href=\"red%20kites\"&gt;red kites&lt;/a&gt;. This was part of a national project to introduce the birds, that were once so commonplace across the country, back into the wild. This scheme has proven to be a success, with birds being spotted across the west of the borough, from Crawcrook to Rowlands Gill itself.\nThe borough also contains one &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty\"&gt;National Trust&lt;/a&gt; site, the expansive &lt;a href=\"Gibside\"&gt;Gibside&lt;/a&gt; estate near Rowlands Gill, containing a &lt;a href=\"stately%20home\"&gt;stately home&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt;, parts of its grounds have also been given SSSI status.\nEven in the more urban areas of the borough, in Gateshead itself and to the east, efforts have been made to maintain green spaces and wildlife sites. One such project is Bill Quay Community Farm, east of the borough. Offering a rural experience within an urban setting, it provides an important educational tool for local schools.\nReligion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001\"&gt;2001 census&lt;/a&gt; stated that the borough's predominant religion was 80.25% &lt;a href=\"Christians\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt;. Other statistics found 10.94% of &lt;a href=\"Irreligion\"&gt;no religion&lt;/a&gt;, 6.94 unstated, 0.82% &lt;a href=\"Jewish\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; and 0.60% &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011\"&gt;2011 census&lt;/a&gt;, stated that the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead was 67.0% Christian, 0.9% Muslim, 1.5% Jewish, 23.9% were not religious and 5.7% of the population refused to state their religion.\nEconomy.\nThe area was once dependent on &lt;a href=\"heavy%20industry\"&gt;heavy industry&lt;/a&gt; such as steel making in the Derwent Valley and coal mining (across the borough). &lt;a href=\"Shipbuilding\"&gt;Shipbuilding&lt;/a&gt; on the Tyne was also a major source of employment. However, with the decline of these industries, Gateshead has attempted to re-invent itself. Although there are significant areas of deprivation in the borough, particularly in the centre and east, a number of towns and villages in the borough are popular with commuters and professionals who are employed in the &lt;a href=\"service%20industry\"&gt;service industry&lt;/a&gt; and well paid areas of the &lt;a href=\"secondary%20sector\"&gt;secondary sector&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; (which remains a major source of employment). Such commuter areas include Ryton, Rowlands Gill, Whickham and Low Fell. The borough is host to &lt;a href=\"Tyne%20Yard\"&gt;Tyne Yard&lt;/a&gt;, a major rail freight yard serving the North East.\nGateshead Quayside, once dominated by industry, has benefited from significant investment and &lt;a href=\"gentrification\"&gt;gentrification&lt;/a&gt; in the past decade. It is now home to the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Centre%20for%20Contemporary%20Art\"&gt;Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Gateshead\"&gt;Sage Gateshead&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area is also an important retail hub, with the largest shopping centre in the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, and second largest in Europe as a whole, the &lt;a href=\"MetroCentre%20%28shopping%20centre%29\"&gt;MetroCentre&lt;/a&gt;, situated adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"A1%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;A1&lt;/a&gt; trunk road. Further retail, and a significant number of engineering companies are located in the &lt;a href=\"Team%20Valley\"&gt;Team Valley&lt;/a&gt; Trading Estate, which at one time was the largest industrial estate in Europe.\nArts and culture.\nGateshead is home to the &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Centre%20for%20Contemporary%20Art\"&gt;Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Gateshead\"&gt;Sage Gateshead&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Gormley\"&gt;Anthony Gormley&lt;/a&gt; structure, the \"&lt;a href=\"Angel%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Angel of the North&lt;/a&gt;\" (the largest free standing sculpture in the United Kingdom) is in Gateshead. This puts Gateshead at the forefront of the &lt;a href=\"arts\"&gt;arts&lt;/a&gt; both regionally and nationally.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shipley%20Art%20Gallery\"&gt;Shipley Art Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, housing outstanding collections of contemporary craft, studio ceramics, paintings and decorative art, is managed by &lt;a href=\"Tyne%20%26amp%3B%20Wear%20Archives%20%26amp%3B%20Museums\"&gt;Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of Gateshead Council. Gateshead is a library authority and within its Central Library is a large venue facility called the Caedmon Hall.\nSports.\nGateshead has an &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt; team, &lt;a href=\"Gateshead%20F.C.\"&gt;Gateshead F.C.&lt;/a&gt;, who play in the English &lt;a href=\"National%20League%20North\"&gt;National League North&lt;/a&gt;. They play at the &lt;a href=\"Gateshead%20International%20Stadium\"&gt;Gateshead International Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, which also hosts &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28sport%29\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;.\nFreedom of the Borough.\nThe following people have received the &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20of%20the%20City\"&gt;Freedom of the Borough&lt;/a&gt; of Gateshead:\nIn addition, freedom was granted to &lt;a href=\"Tyne%20Electrical%20Engineers\"&gt;72 Engineer Regiment&lt;/a&gt; on 9 July 2011."
