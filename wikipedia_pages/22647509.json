    "text": "Europe Ecology () was a &lt;a href=\"green%20politics\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20alliance\"&gt;electoral coalition&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20France\"&gt;political parties in France&lt;/a&gt; created for the &lt;a href=\"2009%20European%20Parliament%20election%20in%20France\"&gt;2009 European elections&lt;/a&gt; composed of &lt;a href=\"The%20Greens%20%28France%29\"&gt;The Greens&lt;/a&gt; and other ecologists and &lt;a href=\"regionalism%20%28politics%29\"&gt;regionalists&lt;/a&gt;. For the &lt;a href=\"2014%20European%20Parliament%20election%20in%20France\"&gt;European Parliament election in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, this electoral alliance was renewed.\nThe coalition was launched on 20 October 2008 with the support of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Green%20Party\"&gt;European Green Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Cohn-Bendit\"&gt;Daniel Cohn-Bendit&lt;/a&gt;, a Franco-German MEP previously representing the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%2790/The%20Greens\"&gt;Alliance '90/The Greens&lt;/a&gt; of Germany, but who ran in France in 2009. Since its creation, the coalition received the support of &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9cile%20Duflot\"&gt;C\u00e9cile Duflot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Bov%C3%A9\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dominique%20Voynet\"&gt;Dominique Voynet&lt;/a&gt; amongst others.\nAfter winning a record 16.28% of the vote in the 2009 European elections, the coalition maintained itself to participate in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20French%20regional%20elections\"&gt;2010 regional elections&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn November 2010, the alliance was transformed into a political party under the name &lt;a href=\"Europe%20Ecology%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Greens\"&gt;Europe Ecology \u2013 The Greens&lt;/a&gt; (EELV).\nComposition.\nEurope \u00c9cologie was made up of the following parties and personalities:\nEuropean Elections 2009.\nResults.\nEurope \u00c9cologie received 16.28% of the vote nationally, or 2,803,759 votes. It placed only 0.2% behind the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Party%20%28France%29\"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; (PS) nationally, and ahead of the PS in key regions such as &lt;a href=\"%C3%8Ele-de-France%20%28region%29\"&gt;\u00cele-de-France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Provence-Alpes-C%C3%B4te%20d%27Azur\"&gt;Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes\"&gt;Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes&lt;/a&gt;. This is the highest result won by any green movement, party or coalition in any national French election.\nIn addition, the smaller green &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Ecological%20Alliance\"&gt;Independent Ecological Alliance&lt;/a&gt; won 3.63% of the votes nationally.\n2010 Regional elections.\nStrong from its excellent result in the European elections, the Europe \u00c9cologie coalition was renewed around &lt;a href=\"The%20Greens%20%28France%29\"&gt;The Greens&lt;/a&gt; and associated parties and movements. Europe \u00c9cologie decided to run independently in all regions, with the intention of supporting the Left in runoffs. However, the party's ultimate goal was said to be to wrest control of a major region, such as &lt;a href=\"%C3%8Ele-de-France%20%28region%29\"&gt;Ile-de-France&lt;/a&gt; from the PS. The coalition's candidates included the researcher &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20Meirieu\"&gt;Philippe Meirieu&lt;/a&gt;, magistrate &lt;a href=\"Laurence%20Vichnievsky\"&gt;Laurence Vichnievsky&lt;/a&gt;, the rural activist &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Dufour\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Dufour&lt;/a&gt; or Augustin Legrand of the homeless' association \"Les Enfants de Don Quichotte\".\nResults.\nEurope \u00c9cologie received 12.19% of the national vote, or 2,373,922 votes, in the first round. The party came third overall behind the &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Party%20%28France%29\"&gt;Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; and conservative &lt;a href=\"Union%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement\"&gt;Union for a Popular Movement&lt;/a&gt;. It recorded good results in Rh\u00f4nes-Alpes (17.82%), \u00cele-de-France (16.58%) and Alsace (15.60%). In the second ballot, Europe \u00c9cologie entered joint lists with the Socialist Party, except in Brittany."
