    "text": "Bambooworking is the activity or skill of making items from &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;, and includes &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carpentry\"&gt;carpentry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furniture\"&gt;furniture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cabinetry\"&gt;cabinetry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carving\"&gt;carving&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"joinery%20%28woodworking%29\"&gt;joinery&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"weaving\"&gt;weaving&lt;/a&gt;. Its historical roots in Asia span cultures, civilizations, and millennia.\nHistory.\nBamboo has hundred of species and grows in large swathes across parts of &lt;a href=\"East%20Asia\"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Asia\"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;. Along with &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rock%20%28geology%29\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; and animal parts, bamboo was one of the first materials worked by &lt;a href=\"early%20human\"&gt;early human&lt;/a&gt;s. The development of civilization was closely tied to the development of increasingly greater degrees of skill in working these materials. Just like &lt;a href=\"woodworking\"&gt;woodworking&lt;/a&gt;, it came to be used for &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20construction\"&gt;bamboo construction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20textiles\"&gt;bamboo textiles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20and%20wooden%20slips\"&gt;bamboo and wooden slips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20musical%20instruments\"&gt;bamboo musical instruments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20weaving\"&gt;bamboo weaving&lt;/a&gt;, and many other areas.\nChina.\nBamboo's long life makes it a Chinese symbol of uprightness. The rarity of its &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20blossom\"&gt;blossoming&lt;/a&gt; has led to the flowers' being regarded as a sign of impending famine. This may be due to rats feeding upon the profusion of flowers, then multiplying and destroying a large part of the local food supply. In &lt;a href=\"Culture%20of%20China\"&gt;Chinese culture&lt;/a&gt;, the bamboo, &lt;a href=\"Prunus%20mume\"&gt;plum&lt;/a&gt; blossom, &lt;a href=\"orchid\"&gt;orchid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"chrysanthemum\"&gt;chrysanthemum&lt;/a&gt; (often known as \"m\u00e9i l\u00e1n zh\u00fa j\u00fa\" \u6885\u5170\u7af9\u83ca) are collectively referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Gentlemen\"&gt;Four Gentlemen&lt;/a&gt;. These four plants also represent the four seasons and, in &lt;a href=\"Confucianism\"&gt;Confucian&lt;/a&gt; ideology, four aspects of the \"&lt;a href=\"junzi\"&gt;junzi&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"prince\" or \"noble one\"). The &lt;a href=\"pine\"&gt;pine&lt;/a&gt; (\"s\u014dng\" \u677e), the bamboo (\"zh\u00fa\" \u7af9), and the plum blossom (\"m\u00e9i\" \u6885) are also admired for their perseverance under harsh conditions, and are together known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Three%20Friends%20of%20Winter\"&gt;Three Friends of Winter&lt;/a&gt;\" (\u5c81\u5bd2\u4e09\u53cb \"su\u00ech\u00e1n s\u0101ny\u01d2u\") in Chinese culture. Bamboo, one of the \"&lt;a href=\"Four%20Gentlemen\"&gt;Four Gentlemen&lt;/a&gt;\" (bamboo, orchid, plum blossom and chrysanthemum), plays such an important role in traditional Chinese culture that it is even regarded as a behavior model of the gentleman. As bamboo has features such as uprightness, tenacity, and hollow heart, people endow bamboo with integrity, elegance, and plainness, though it is not physically strong. Countless poems praising bamboo written by ancient Chinese poets are actually metaphorically about people who exhibited these characteristics. According to laws, the Tang dynasty Chinese poet, &lt;a href=\"Bai%20Juyi\"&gt;Bai Juyi&lt;/a&gt; (772\u2013846), thought that to be a gentleman, a man does not need to be physically strong, but he must be mentally strong, upright, and perseverant. Just as a bamboo is hollow-hearted, he should open his heart to accept anything of benefit and never have arrogance or prejudice.\nThe use of bamboo in Neolithic China is well established as the Chinese were among the first civilizations to employ the use of bamboo. The cultivation and application of bamboo has played an important in the development of Chinese civilization from prehistoric times to the present. From prehistoric times to the present, bamboo has been used extensively in one form or another as the use of bamboo affected the everyday life of Chinese civilization. Chinese poets extolled this plant and Chinese painters cherished the plant's beauty and grace through paintings across various Chinese dynasties. Archaeological ruins signifying the Chinese use of bamboo for vessels and containers, woven baskets to mats dating back to the Neolithic era were unearthed from Qianshanyang, Zhejiang. Around 6000 BC, bamboo motifs were used to decorate the neolithic pottery of the Yangshao culture and bamboo baskets dating back to 2000 BC have been discovered in addition to bamboo slips that were used as a writing surface dating from the Warring States period (475 - 221 BC). Bamboo during prehistoric China was used for a variety of purposes such as rafts, fans, cutting knives, arrowheads, chisels, needles, saw blades, cooking utensils, loomweights and writing tools.\nThere are about 300 species of bamboo found in China, the greatest number of any country covering 12,350 square miles. The Chinese appreciated bamboo as the material was strong and pliant. Bamboo leaves were often depicted in Chinese art. In addition, the use of bamboo was employed to make a wide variety of daily items such as containers, chopsticks, hats, trays, mats, baskets, umbrellas, rafts, building materials, fences, drilling materials, weapons, medicine, musical instruments, pipelines and raincoats. Thin strips of bamboo were woven together and the stalks were heated and bent to make chairs, beds, drawers, tables, and folding screens.\nJapan.\nMore than six hundred species of &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; grow in Japan, including the \"&lt;a href=\"Phyllostachys%20bambusoides\"&gt;Phyllostachys bambusoides&lt;/a&gt;\" variety, which can grow to a height of 15\u201322 m and a diameter of 10\u201315\u00a0cm. Although defined as a subfamily of grasses, bamboo is characterized by its woody &lt;a href=\"culm%20%28botany%29\"&gt;culm&lt;/a&gt; and a root system that can form either aggressive runners or thick, slowly spreading clusters.\nBamboo is a common theme in &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20literature\"&gt;Japanese literature&lt;/a&gt; and a favoured subject of painters. Along with the evergreen pine and plum, which is the first flower of spring, bamboo is a part of the traditional &lt;a href=\"Three%20Friends%20of%20Winter\"&gt;Three Friends of Winter&lt;/a&gt;. The three are a symbol of steadfastness, perseverance, and resilience. Japanese artists have often represented bamboo enduring inclement weather, such as rain or snow, reflecting its reputation for being flexible but unbreakable, and its association with steadfastness and loyalty.\n is a traditional &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20craft\"&gt;Japanese craft&lt;/a&gt; with a range of fine and decorative arts, and has been used for traditional architecture as well as for utilitarian objects such as fans, tea scoops, and flower baskets. Objects were used in the 8th century for Buddhist rituals and one of the oldest surviving baskets is housed in the &lt;a href=\"Sh%C5%8Ds%C5%8D-in\"&gt;Sh\u014ds\u014d-in&lt;/a&gt; in Nara. The 16th century tea master &lt;a href=\"Sen%20no%20Riky%C5%AB\"&gt;Sen no Riky\u016b&lt;/a&gt; (1522\u20131591) advocated for a simple, austere tea style (\"wabi-cha\") with natural or seemingly artless utensils. These tea utensils established a Japanese bamboo art distinct from the imported Chinese style. Examples of tea utensils made out of bamboo are lid rests (\"futaoki\" \u84cb\u7f6e), flower vessels (\"take-hanaire\" \u82b1\u5165), basketry flower vessels (\"kago-hanaire\") which are usually reserved for use in the warm season, kettle mats (\"takekamashiki\" \u91dc\u6577), ash receptacle bamboo tubes (\"haifuki\" \u7070\u5439), ladles (\"hishaku\" \u67c4\u6753), tea scoops (\"chashaku\" \u8336\u6753), and whisks (\"chasen\" \u8336\u7b45). Tea masters have traditionally carved their own scoops, providing them with a bamboo storage tube (\"tsutsu\"), as well as a poetic name (\"mei\" \u9298) that will often be inscribed on the storage tube. Recognition of bamboo craftsmanship as a traditional Japanese decorative art began in the end of the 19th century, and became accepted as an art form.\nApart from carving bamboo, another important area is &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20bamboo%20weaving\"&gt;bamboo weaving&lt;/a&gt;.\nSupplemental usage of bamboo in architecture can include scaffolding, windows, walls, fences, and water pipes such as \"&lt;a href=\"shishi-odoshi\"&gt;shishi-odoshi&lt;/a&gt;\". Items for catching, transporting, and preparing food can include cages, baskets, cooking vessels, &lt;a href=\"Rolling%20pin\"&gt;rollers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"chopsticks\"&gt;chopsticks&lt;/a&gt;. Items for personal hygiene carved out of bamboo are traditional &lt;a href=\"comb\"&gt;comb&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"earpick\"&gt;earpick&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"toothpick\"&gt;toothpick&lt;/a&gt;s. Personal Items such as &lt;a href=\"hat\"&gt;hat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shoe\"&gt;shoe&lt;/a&gt;s out of thin strips were made, as well as &lt;a href=\"parasol\"&gt;parasol&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Hand%20fan\"&gt;fan&lt;/a&gt;s. Bamboo was also crafted into weapons such as the \"&lt;a href=\"yumi\"&gt;yumi&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;s, and for martial arts such as the \"&lt;a href=\"shinai\"&gt;shinai&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Bamboo%20textile\"&gt;Bamboo textile&lt;/a&gt;s could be won to be used for ropes and even woven as a fabric. A whole range of musical wind instruments are also crafted out of bamboo, such as the \"&lt;a href=\"hotchiku\"&gt;hotchiku&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"kagurabue\"&gt;kagurabue&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"komabue\"&gt;komabue&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"minteki\"&gt;minteki&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"nohkan\"&gt;nohkan&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"ry%C5%ABteki\"&gt;ry\u016bteki&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"shakuhachi\"&gt;shakuhachi&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"shinobue\"&gt;shinobue&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"yokobue\"&gt;yokobue&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Economy%2C%20Trade%20and%20Industry\"&gt;Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry&lt;/a&gt; designated it a traditional craft with the following groups: "
