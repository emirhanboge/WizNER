    "text": "Unione Sportiva Avellino 1912, commonly known as US Avellino, is an Italian professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in &lt;a href=\"Avellino\"&gt;Avellino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Campania\"&gt;Campania&lt;/a&gt;. It competes in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C\"&gt;Serie C&lt;/a&gt;, the third tier of &lt;a href=\"Football%20in%20Italy\"&gt;Italian football&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is the official continuity club of US Avellino 1912, known worldwide for having competed in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; for ten consecutive seasons, from &lt;a href=\"1978%E2%80%9379%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1978-1979&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1987%E2%80%9388%20Serie%20A\"&gt;1987-1988&lt;/a&gt;. The team went through two major reboots: once, in 2009, when it went bankrupt, and then, in 2018, when it was excluded from &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt;. In both cases, new clubs were founded to join the &lt;a href=\"Serie%20D\"&gt;Serie D&lt;/a&gt; league.\nThe club was renamed as \"Avellino Calcio.12 Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Dilettantistica\" in 2009, then \"Associazione Sportiva Avellino 1912\" in 2010, and restored to the original \"Unione Sportiva Avellino 1912\" in 2015, although initially taking the name \"Calcio Avellino Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Dilettantistica\" for the &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Serie%20D\"&gt;2018-2019&lt;/a&gt; season.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe club was founded as \"U.S. Avellino\" on 12 December 1912 to give the town of &lt;a href=\"Avellino\"&gt;Avellino&lt;/a&gt; a footballing representative. The early history of the club is quite obscure as they only competed at a lower level against regional sides. Avellino competed in \"IV Divisione\" from 1913 until after the Second World War; today's equivalent of that level is &lt;a href=\"Serie%20D\"&gt;Serie D&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-War Emergence.\nFor the earlier part of their history the club did not achieve anything of note, until being placed in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C\"&gt;Serie C&lt;/a&gt; for the 1945\u201346 post-War season. In the 1946\u201347 season they narrowly missed out on getting through to the interregional final, after finishing third in their group.\nAvellino beat out the likes of &lt;a href=\"Calcio%20Catania\"&gt;Catania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reggina%20Calcio\"&gt;Reggina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Messina%20Peloro\"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt; to win promotion to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the 1940s. However, the club were accused of &lt;a href=\"match%20fixing\"&gt;match fixing&lt;/a&gt; and the federation decided to strip them of their promotion, instead relegating them down to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20D\"&gt;Serie D&lt;/a&gt;. Although they were able to return to Serie C after one season, Avellino were relegated back down to spend six seasons in a row at Serie D level.\nEventually Avellino returned, but, in the space of six seasons, Avellino gained promotion to Serie C in three of them and were relegated back down twice.\n1970s: Rise and Ten Consecutive Seasons in Serie A.\nAvellino were promoted to &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; in 1973 and Serie A in 1978. A truly remarkable feat for a southern provincial side was a 10-year stay in Serie A between 1978 and 1988, with the club holding a mid-table place for the majority of that period. Their best finish was 8th in 1987, with a team starring &lt;a href=\"Angelo%20Alessio\"&gt;Angelo Alessio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Benedetti\"&gt;Paolo Benedetti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Colomba\"&gt;Franco Colomba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dirceu\"&gt;Dirceu&lt;/a&gt;.\n1990s and 2000s: Decline, Ups and Downs, and Bankruptcy.\nThe club tended to shift between &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C1\"&gt;Serie C1&lt;/a&gt; in the decade following relegation from &lt;a href=\"Serie%20A\"&gt;Serie A&lt;/a&gt; in 1988.\nThe club marked a surprising &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt; return after defeating neighbors and football powerhouse &lt;a href=\"S.S.C.%20Napoli\"&gt;Napoli&lt;/a&gt; in the 2004-05 Serie C1/B &lt;a href=\"play-off\"&gt;play-off&lt;/a&gt; finals. An unsuccessful 2005\u201306 campaign ended in a loss on relegation playoffs to &lt;a href=\"U.C.%20AlbinoLeffe\"&gt;Albinoleffe&lt;/a&gt; (0\u20132, 3\u20132). The 2006\u201307 season, with &lt;a href=\"Giuseppe%20Galderisi\"&gt;Giuseppe Galderisi&lt;/a&gt; as head coach, then replaced by &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Vavassori\"&gt;Giovanni Vavassori&lt;/a&gt;, ended in a second place in the Serie C1/B regular season; this was then followed by a successful campaign in the promotion play-offs, in which Avellino defeated &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Foggia\"&gt;Foggia&lt;/a&gt; in the finals, being therefore promoted to Serie B once again. However, this was followed by Vavassori's resignations on 16 July 2007, shortly after his confirmation as Avellino boss, being then replaced by &lt;a href=\"Maurizio%20Sarri\"&gt;Maurizio Sarri&lt;/a&gt; two days later. Sarri himself resigned one month later, being replaced by &lt;a href=\"Guido%20Carboni\"&gt;Guido Carboni&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Alessandro%20Calori\"&gt;Alessandro Calori&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the club did not manage to escape relegation, ending the season in 19th place. The club was however readmitted to Serie B later on to fill a league vacancy created by &lt;a href=\"F.C.%20Messina%20Peloro\"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt;'s disbandment.\nThe team finished second from bottom in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B%202008-09\"&gt;the 2008\u201309 season&lt;/a&gt; and was therefore relegated again. On 9 July 2009, the Covisoc (\"Commissione di Vigilanza sulle Societ\u00e0 Calcistiche\", Vigilancy Commission on Football Clubs) organization announced that the team did not pass the financial requirements in order to be admitted to the league. The club was allowed to appeal the decision until 11 July 2009. On 11 July, Avellino failed to appeal the exclusion.\nAvellino Calcio.12 S.S.D. restarts from Serie D.\nA new club founded in the summer 2009 as \"Avellino Calcio.12 S.S.D.\" restarts from Serie D, finishing 5th, but 4 August 2010 they were later admitted to &lt;a href=\"Lega%20Pro%20Seconda%20Divisione\"&gt;Lega Pro Seconda Divisione&lt;/a&gt; to fill vacancies. This ordeal saw them become the latest in a long line of Italian clubs that have faced severe financial difficulties, such as Napoli and Fiorentina.\nFrom Lega Pro Seconda Divisione to Serie B.\nIn the 2010\u201311 season the team became Associazione Sportiva Avellino 1912 and played in &lt;a href=\"Lega%20Pro%20Seconda%20Divisione\"&gt;Lega Pro Seconda Divisione&lt;/a&gt; finishing 4th, being defeated by &lt;a href=\"Trapani%20Calcio\"&gt;Trapani&lt;/a&gt; in the play-off final, but 4 August 2011 it was later admitted to &lt;a href=\"Lega%20Pro%20Prima%20Divisione\"&gt;Lega Pro Prima Divisione&lt;/a&gt;, again, to fill vacancies. In the season 2012\u201313 Avellino won &lt;a href=\"Lega%20Pro%20Prima%20Divisione\"&gt;Lega Pro Prima Divisione&lt;/a&gt; and the team obtained the promotion in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20B\"&gt;Serie B&lt;/a&gt;, under manager &lt;a href=\"Massimo%20Rastelli\"&gt;Massimo Rastelli&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Serie%20B\"&gt;2014-2015&lt;/a&gt;, Rastelli led the team to the play-off semi-finals, when they are eliminated by the more prestigious &lt;a href=\"Bologna%20F.C.%201909\"&gt;Bologna&lt;/a&gt; team despite a 3-2 win away.\n2018 Serie B Exclusion.\nIn 2018, Avellino was excluded from Serie B due to submitting a league membership paperwork that was deemed as incomplete, due to a late bank guarantee. Due to this, a new club was re-founded within days in order to submit application to play at &lt;a href=\"Serie%20D\"&gt;Serie D&lt;/a&gt; instead. In 2019 Avellino won Serie D and the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Serie%20D%20champions%20and%20promotions\"&gt;Scudetto Serie D&lt;/a&gt;, reaching the promotion in &lt;a href=\"Serie%20C\"&gt;Serie C&lt;/a&gt; for the next season. In &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Serie%20C\"&gt;2020-2021&lt;/a&gt;, they once again reached the play-off semi-finals, losing to Padova.\nColors and badge.\nIts traditional colours are green and white.\nAvellino are nicknamed the \"Lupi\", which means wolf, and their club crest displays a wolf head.\nPlayers.\n\"As of 31 January 2022.\"\nRetired numbers.\n10\u00a0\u2013 &lt;a href=\"Adriano%20Lombardi\"&gt;Adriano Lombardi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Midfielder\"&gt;Midfielder&lt;/a&gt; (1975\u201379) \u2013 \"posthumous honor, number retired in 2007.\""
