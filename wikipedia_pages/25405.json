    "text": "Rugby union, commonly known simply as rugby, is a &lt;a href=\"Contact%20sport%23Terminology\"&gt;close-contact&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"team%20sport\"&gt;team sport&lt;/a&gt; that originated in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in the first half of the 19th century. One of the &lt;a href=\"Comparison%20of%20rugby%20league%20and%20rugby%20union\"&gt;two codes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby football&lt;/a&gt;, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players each, using an &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20ball\"&gt;oval-shaped ball&lt;/a&gt; on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped &lt;a href=\"Goal%20%28sports%29%23Structure\"&gt;goalposts&lt;/a&gt; at both ends.\nRugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. In 2014, there were more than 6\u00a0million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36\u00a0million were registered players. &lt;a href=\"World%20Rugby\"&gt;World Rugby&lt;/a&gt;, previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members.\nIn 1845, the first laws were written by pupils at &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20School\"&gt;Rugby School&lt;/a&gt;; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by &lt;a href=\"Blackheath%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackheath F.C.&lt;/a&gt; to leave &lt;a href=\"the%20Football%20Association\"&gt;the Football Association&lt;/a&gt; in 1863 and, in 1895, the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20rugby%20league%23The%20schism%20in%20England\"&gt;split&lt;/a&gt; between rugby union and &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt;. Historically rugby union was an amateur sport, but in 1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.\nRugby union spread from the &lt;a href=\"Home%20Nations\"&gt;Home Nations&lt;/a&gt; of Great Britain and Ireland, with other early exponents of the sport including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France. The sport is followed primarily in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Isles\"&gt;British Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oceania\"&gt;Oceania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Africa\"&gt;Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, and to a lesser extent &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uruguay\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, its growth occurring during the expansion of the British Empire and through French proponents (&lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Europe\"&gt;Rugby Europe&lt;/a&gt;) in Europe. Countries that have adopted rugby union as their \"de facto\" &lt;a href=\"national%20sport\"&gt;national sport&lt;/a&gt; include Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Wales.\nInternational matches have taken place since 1871 when the first game was played between Scotland and England at &lt;a href=\"Raeburn%20Place\"&gt;Raeburn Place&lt;/a&gt; in Edinburgh. The &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, first held in 1987, is held every four years. The &lt;a href=\"Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;Six Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt; in Europe and &lt;a href=\"The%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;The Rugby Championship&lt;/a&gt; in the Southern Hemisphere are other important international competitions that are held annually.\nNational club and provincial competitions include the &lt;a href=\"Premiership%20Rugby\"&gt;Premiership&lt;/a&gt; in England, the &lt;a href=\"Top%2014\"&gt;Top 14&lt;/a&gt; in France, the &lt;a href=\"Bunnings%20NPC\"&gt;Bunnings NPC&lt;/a&gt; in New Zealand, the &lt;a href=\"Top%20League\"&gt;Top League&lt;/a&gt; in Japan and the &lt;a href=\"Currie%20Cup\"&gt;Currie Cup&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa. Other transnational club competitions include the &lt;a href=\"United%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;United Rugby Championship&lt;/a&gt; of club teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland, South Africa and Wales, &lt;a href=\"European%20Rugby%20Champions%20Cup\"&gt;European Rugby Champions Cup&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby%20Pacific\"&gt;Super Rugby Pacific&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.\nHistory.\nRugby football stems from the form of the game played at &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20School\"&gt;Rugby School&lt;/a&gt;, which former pupils then introduced to their universities.\nFormer Rugby School student &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Pell\"&gt;Albert Pell&lt;/a&gt; is credited with having formed the first \"football\" team while a student at &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20University\"&gt;Cambridge University&lt;/a&gt;. Major private schools each used different rules during this early period, with former pupils from Rugby and &lt;a href=\"Eton%20College\"&gt;Eton&lt;/a&gt; attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities. A significant event in the early development of rugby football was the production of a written set of rules at Rugby School in 1845, followed by the &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20Rules\"&gt;Cambridge Rules&lt;/a&gt; that were drawn up in 1848.\nFormed in 1863, the national governing body &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20Association\"&gt;The Football Association&lt;/a&gt; (FA) began codifying a set of universal football rules. These new rules specifically banned players from running with the ball in hand and also disallowed &lt;a href=\"Hacking%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;hacking&lt;/a&gt; (kicking players in the shins), both of which were legal and common tactics under the Rugby School's rules of the sport. In protest at the imposition of the new rules, the &lt;a href=\"Blackheath%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackheath Club&lt;/a&gt; left the FA followed by several other clubs that also favoured the \"Rugby Rules\". Although these clubs decided to ban hacking soon afterwards, the split was permanent, and &lt;a href=\"Laws%20of%20the%20Game%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;the FA's codified rules&lt;/a&gt; became known as \"&lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;association football&lt;/a&gt;\" whilst the clubs that had favoured the Rugby Rules formed the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Rugby Football Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1871, and their code became known as \"&lt;a href=\"rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby football&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn 1895, there was &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20rugby%20league%23The%20schism%20in%20England\"&gt;a major schism within rugby football&lt;/a&gt; in England in which numerous clubs from Northern England resigned from the RFU over the issue of reimbursing players for time lost from their workplaces. The split highlighted the social and class divisions in the sport in England. Although the rules of the game were not a factor in the split, the breakaway teams subsequently adopted some rule changes and this became the separate code of \"&lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt;\". The RFU's code thereafter took on the name \"rugby union\" to differentiate it from rugby league, but both versions of the sport are known simply as \"rugby\" throughout most of the world.\nFirst internationals.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1871%20England%20versus%20Scotland%20rugby%20union%20match\"&gt;first rugby football international&lt;/a&gt; was played on 27 March 1871 between &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;. Scotland won the game 1\u20130. By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams and in 1883 the first international competition, the &lt;a href=\"Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;Home Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt; had begun. 1883 is also the year of the first &lt;a href=\"rugby%20sevens\"&gt;rugby sevens&lt;/a&gt; tournament, the &lt;a href=\"Melrose%20Sevens\"&gt;Melrose Sevens&lt;/a&gt;, which is still held annually.\nTwo important overseas tours took place in 1888: a &lt;a href=\"1888%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand%20and%20Australia\"&gt;British Isles&lt;/a&gt; team visited Australia and New Zealand\u2014although a private venture, it laid the foundations for future &lt;a href=\"British%20and%20Irish%20Lions\"&gt;British and Irish Lions&lt;/a&gt; tours; and the &lt;a href=\"1888%E2%80%9389%20New%20Zealand%20Native%20football%20team\"&gt;1888\u201389 New Zealand Native football team&lt;/a&gt; brought the first overseas team to British spectators.\nDuring the early history of rugby union, a time before commercial air travel, teams from different continents rarely met. The first two notable tours both took place in 1888the British Isles team touring New Zealand and Australia, followed by the New Zealand team touring Europe. Traditionally the most prestigious tours were the Southern Hemisphere countries of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa making a tour of a Northern Hemisphere, and the return tours made by a joint British and Irish team. Tours would last for months, due to long traveling times and the number of games undertaken; the 1888 New Zealand team began their tour in Hawkes Bay in June and did not complete their schedule until August 1889, having played 107 rugby matches. Touring international sides would play Test matches against international opponents, including national, club and county sides in the case of Northern Hemisphere rugby, or provincial/state sides in the case of Southern Hemisphere rugby.\nBetween 1905 and 1908, all three major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: &lt;a href=\"The%20Original%20All%20Blacks\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in 1905, followed by &lt;a href=\"1906%E2%80%9307%20South%20Africa%20rugby%20union%20tour\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in 1906 and &lt;a href=\"1908%E2%80%9309%20Australia%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Britain\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics, and were far more successful than critics had expected.\nThe New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a &lt;a href=\"Ka%20Mate\"&gt;haka&lt;/a&gt; before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Williams%20%28rugby%20player%2C%20born%201860%29\"&gt;Tom Williams&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that Wales player &lt;a href=\"Teddy%20Morgan\"&gt;Teddy Morgan&lt;/a&gt; lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National Anthem, \"&lt;a href=\"Hen%20Wlad%20Fy%20Nhadau\"&gt;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&lt;/a&gt;\", as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in: the first time a national anthem was sung at the start of a sporting event. In 1905 France played England in its first international match.\nRugby union was included as an event in the Olympic Games four times during the early 20th century. No international rugby games and union-sponsored club matches were played during the First World War, but competitions continued through service teams such as the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Army%20rugby%20team%20of%201919\"&gt;New Zealand Army team&lt;/a&gt;. During the Second World War no international matches were played by most countries, though Italy, Germany and Romania played a limited number of games, and &lt;a href=\"Cambridge%20University%20R.U.F.C.\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20University%20RFC\"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt; continued their annual &lt;a href=\"The%20Varsity%20Match\"&gt;University Match&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first officially sanctioned international rugby sevens tournament took place in 1973 at Murrayfield, one of Scotland's biggest stadiums, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Scottish Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; centenary celebrations.\nWorld Cup and professionalism.\nIn 1987 the first Rugby World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, and the inaugural winners were New Zealand. The first World Cup Sevens tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993. Rugby Sevens was introduced into the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Rugby%20Sevens%20Championships\"&gt;Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt; in 1998 and was added to the Olympic Games of 2016. Both men and women's Sevens will again take place at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.\nRugby union was an amateur sport until the IRB declared the game \"open\" in August 1995 (shortly after the completion of the 1995 World Cup), removing restrictions on payments to players. However, the pre-1995 period of rugby union was marked by frequent accusations of \"&lt;a href=\"shamateurism\"&gt;shamateurism&lt;/a&gt;\", including an investigation in Britain by a House of Commons Select committee in early 1995. Following the introduction of professionalism trans-national club competitions were started, with the &lt;a href=\"Heineken%20Cup\"&gt;Heineken Cup&lt;/a&gt; in the Northern Hemisphere and &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt; in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe &lt;a href=\"The%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;Tri Nations&lt;/a&gt;, an annual international tournament involving Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, kicked off in 1996. In &lt;a href=\"2012%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, this competition was extended to include &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, a country whose impressive performances in international games (especially finishing in third place in the 2007 Rugby World Cup) was deemed to merit inclusion in the competition. As a result of the expansion to four teams, the tournament was renamed The Rugby Championship.\nTeams and positions.\nEach team starts the match with 15 players on the field and seven or eight substitutes. Players in a team are divided into eight &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Forwards\"&gt;forwards&lt;/a&gt; (two more than in &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt;) and seven &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Backs\"&gt;backs&lt;/a&gt;.\nForwards.\nThe main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball. Forwards play a vital role in tackling and rucking opposing players. Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the &lt;a href=\"Scrum%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;scrum&lt;/a&gt; and line-out. The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.\nFront row.\nThe front row consists of three players: two &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Prop\"&gt;props&lt;/a&gt; (the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop) and the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Hooker\"&gt;hooker&lt;/a&gt;. The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs.\nSecond row.\nThe second row consists of two &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Locks\"&gt;locks&lt;/a&gt; or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialise as line-out jumpers. The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players and providing forward drive.\nBack row.\nThe back row, not to be confused with 'Backs', is the third and final row of the forward positions, who are often referred to as the loose forwards. The three positions in the back row are the two &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Flanker\"&gt;flankers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Number%20eight\"&gt;number 8&lt;/a&gt;. The two flanker positions called the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in the scrum. They are usually the most mobile forwards in the game. Their main role is to win possession through 'turn overs'. The number 8 packs down between the two locks at the back of the scrum. The role of the number 8 in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from the front of the pack, and the position provides a link between the forwards and backs during attacking phases. /\nBacks.\nThe role of the backs is to create and convert point-scoring opportunities. They are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards. Another distinction between the backs and the forwards is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking and ball-handling skills, especially the fly-half, scrum-half, and full-back.\nHalf-backs.\nThe half-backs consist of two positions, the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Scrum-half\"&gt;scrum-half&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Fly-half\"&gt;fly-half&lt;/a&gt; also known in the Southern Hemisphere as, half-back and first five-eighth respectively. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating the team's performance. They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout, or scrum, and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs. Many fly-halves are also their team's goal kickers. The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs. They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half. They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.\nThree-quarters.\nThere are four three quarter positions: two &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Centre\"&gt;centres&lt;/a&gt; (inside and outside) and two &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Wing\"&gt;wings&lt;/a&gt; (left and right), the inside centre is commonly referred to as the second five-eighth in the Southern Hemisphere. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack, they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences. The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries. Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are elusive runners who use their speed to avoid tackles.\nFull-back.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20positions%23Full-back\"&gt;full-back&lt;/a&gt; is normally positioned several metres behind the back line. They often field opposition kicks and are usually the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line. Two of the most important attributes of a good full-back are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.\nLaws and gameplay.\nScoring.\nRugby union is played between two teams\u00a0\u2013 the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a &lt;a href=\"Try%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt;, scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead-ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;penalty kick&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"drop%20goal\"&gt;drop goal&lt;/a&gt; each score 3 points. The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years. \nPlaying field.\nAccording to World Rugby's Laws of the Game, a typical rugby ground, formally known as the \"playing enclosure\", is formed by two major zones:\nThe referee (and their assistants) generally have full authority and responsibility for all players and other officials inside the playing enclosure. Fences or ropes (particularly at amateur clubs) are generally used to mark the extent of this area, although in modern stadia this may include the entire arena floor or other designated space.\nThe Laws, above all, require that the playing enclosure's surface be safe, whilst also permitting grass, sand, clay, snow or conforming artificial turf to be used; the surface would generally be uniform across both the playing area and perimeter area, although depending on how large the perimeter is, other surfaces such as dirt, artificial turf, etc. may be used outside of a \"sliding\" perimeter from the bounds of the playing area.\nPlaying area.\nFor the most part, the \"playing area\" is where the majority of play occurs. The ball is generally considered live whilst in this area, so long as players do not infringe, with special rules applied to specific zones of the playing area.\nThe playing area consists of:\nField of play.\nA typical \"field of play\" is generally 100 metres long by 68\u201370 metres wide for senior rugby, depending on the specific requirements of each ground. The Laws require the field of play to be between 94 metres (103 yards) and 100 metres (109 yards) long, with a width of between 68 metres (75 yards) and 70 metres (77 yards).\nAs other football codes, such as association football and rugby league, have specified a preferred or standard 68 metre width, this is often used unless a ground has been specifically designed to accommodate a 70-metre rugby field. 100 metres is the typical length, with a line (see below) often marked at halfway with \"50\" on it, representing 50 metres from each goal line. The variations have been allowed in the Laws, possibly to accommodate older grounds (perhaps even pre-metrification when yards and feet were specified) and developing nations.\nOther lines and markings.\nThe field of play is divided by a solid \"halfway\" line, drawn perpendicular to the sidelines at their midpoint. A 0.5m line is marked perpendicular to the halfway lines at its midpoint, designating the spot where the kickoffs shall be taken. The areas between each goal line and the halfway line are known as \"halves\" as in other football codes.\nA pair of solid lines are also drawn perpendicular to the sidelines, 22 metres (formerly 25 yards) from each end of the field of play and called the 22-metre lines, or \"22\"s. An area at each end, also known as the \"22\", is bounded by, but does not include, the sidelines, goal line and 22-metre line. In this area, a defensive player who cleanly catches a ball kicked by the other team, without the ball having already touched the ground after the kick, is entitled to claim a free kick, or \"mark\".\nAdditional broken or dashed lines (of 5 metre dash lengths, according to the Laws) are drawn in each half or on each side of, the field, each with specific purposes under the Laws:\nGenerally, points where the dashed lines intersect other lines will be marked with a \"T\" or cross shape, although the extensions of dashed lines are generally not drawn within 5 metres of the goal lines or sidelines, to allow a clear demarcation of the field of play's boundaries.\nThe Laws require the playing area to be rectangular in shape, however variations may be permitted with the approval of relevant unions. A notable example is Chatswood Oval in Sydney, Australia, an elliptically shaped cricket ground which is the home of Gordon rugby club, that has curved dead-ball lines to maximise the available in-goal space.\nWhere multiple sports share a field (e.g. a rugby league and a rugby union club sharing one field), lines may be overlaid on top of each other, sometimes in different colours. However, particularly for television, rugby union line markings are generally painted white. Some exceptions include the Wallabies (Australia's national team) who often have yellow markings. Local clubs may use black, yellow, or other colours on grass, with other surfaces possibly requiring different marking techniques.\nUnlike association football, where on-field advertising is strictly forbidden in the laws, World Rugby allows sponsors logos to be painted on the playing surface. This is another way in which clubs can make money in the professional era and is also often used by host nations, professional leagues and tournaments as additional revenue streams, particularly when games are broadcast. In recent years, augmented reality technology has been used to replace painting to protect the surface or save costs on painting fields, producing a similar effect for broadcast albeit sometimes with poorer results.\nIn-goal areas.\nThe in-goal areas sit behind the goal lines, equivalent to American football's \"end zones\". The in-goal areas must be between 6 metres (7 yards) and 22 metres (25 yards) deep and cover the full width of the field. A ball grounded in this area by an attacking player will generally result in a try being awarded, unless there has been a previous infringement or the player has gone out-of-bounds whilst in possession of the ball.\nPerimeter area.\nThe perimeter area is considered \"out-of-bounds\" for the ball and the players, normally resulting in the non-infringing team receiving possession of the ball at a restart. The perimeter area can be divided into two areas:\nFor the purposes of determining if a ball is \"out-of-bounds\" (i.e. has left the playing area), the perimeter area extends indefinitely away from the playing area.\nWhen a ball or player goes into touch, a lineout throw is generally awarded to the opposition at the spot on the sideline where they left the field. Exceptions include a kick out \"on the full\" (i.e. the ball did not land in the field-of-play before going into touch) in which case the lineout would still take place on the sideline but back in line with where the ball was kicked, or when a team takes a free kick from a penalty where they would retain the right to throw-in.\nThe perimeter area should be clear and free of obstructions and heavy, solid objects which could pose a danger to players for at least 5 metres from the playing area, according to the Laws. Players often leave the playing area whether accidentally or due to being forced off of the field, sometimes sliding or needing to slow down from a sprint. Many venues at elite levels leave larger spaces around the field to accommodate fitter and faster (or heavier) players. Fixed cameras on tripods and advertising hoardings are often the main culprits for injuring players in the perimeter area.\nFlag posts.\nAlso required in the perimeter area are a set of 14 flag posts, each with a minimum height of 1.2 metres, marking the intersections of certain lines or other nominated distances. These are generally a plastic pole on a spring loaded or otherwise soft base, sometimes with a flag on top, covered in foam padding. Others may be moulded plastic or disposable cardboard. At lower levels, these flags may not be used, but are still specified in the Laws. Flags are placed as follows:\nGoalposts.\nRugby goalposts are H-shaped and are situated in the middle of the goal lines at each end of the field. They consist of two vertical poles (known as \"uprights\"), generally made of steel or other metal but sometimes wood or a plastic, apart, connected by a horizontal \"crossbar\" above the ground. The minimum height for posts' uprights is , with taller posts generally seen. The bottom parts of each upright are generally wrapped in purpose-made padding to protect players from injury when coming into contact with the posts and creating another opportunity for sponsors. If an attacking player grounds the ball onto the base of the upright or post padding, a try will be awarded as the base of the upright is considered in-goal.\nMatch structure.\nAt the beginning of the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team will kick off first. Play then starts with a dropkick, with the players chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying to retrieve the ball and advance it. The dropkick must make contact with the ground before kicked. If the ball does not reach the opponent's line 10 meters away, the opposing team has two choices: to have the ball kicked off again, or to have a &lt;a href=\"scrum%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;scrum&lt;/a&gt; at the centre of the half-way line.\nIf the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a &lt;a href=\"Playing%20rugby%20union%23Ruck\"&gt;ruck&lt;/a&gt; will result.\nGames are divided into 40-minute halves, with an &lt;a href=\"Half-time\"&gt;intermission&lt;/a&gt; of not more than 15 minutes in the middle. The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break. Stoppages for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action do not count as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer than 80 minutes. The referee is responsible for keeping time, even when\u2014as in many professional tournaments\u2014he is assisted by an official time-keeper. If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues until the ball is \"dead\", and only then will the referee blow the whistle to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or free-kick, the game continues.\nIn the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, two extra time periods of 10 minutes periods are played (with an interval of 5 minutes in between) if the game is tied after full-time. If scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for 20 minutes of sudden-death extra time to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner. However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.\nPassing and kicking.\nForward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards. The ball tends to be moved forward in three ways\u2014by kicking, by a player running with it or within a scrum or &lt;a href=\"Playing%20rugby%20union%23Maul\"&gt;maul&lt;/a&gt;. Only the player with the ball may be tackled or rucked. A \"knock-on\" is committed when a player knocks the ball forward, and play is restarted with a scrum.\nAny player may kick the ball forward in an attempt to gain territory. When a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into &lt;a href=\"Touch%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;touch&lt;/a&gt; so that the ball first bounces in the field of play, the throw-in is taken where the ball went into touch. If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing in-field first) from within one's own line, the lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the line, the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.\nBreakdowns.\nThe aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing them to ground (a tackle, which is frequently followed by a ruck) or by contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). Such a circumstance is called a breakdown and each is governed by a specific law.\nTackling\nA player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by holding them while bringing them to ground. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds), and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a tap-tackle or &lt;a href=\"Ankle%20tap\"&gt;ankle-tap&lt;/a&gt;). Tacklers may not tackle an opponent who has jumped to catch a ball until the player has landed.\nRucking and Mauling\nMauls occur after a player with the ball has come into contact with an opponent but the handler remains on his feet; once any combination of at least three players have bound themselves a maul has been set. A ruck is similar to the maul, but in this case the ball has gone to ground with at least three attacking players binding themselves on the ground in an attempt to secure the ball.\nSet pieces.\nLineout.\nWhen the ball leaves the side of the field, a &lt;a href=\"line-out%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;line-out&lt;/a&gt; is awarded against the team which last touched the ball. Forward players from each team line up a metre apart, perpendicular to the touchline and between from the touchline. The ball is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by a player (usually the &lt;a href=\"hooker%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;hooker&lt;/a&gt;) from the team that did not play the ball into touch. The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in.\nBoth sides compete for the ball and players may lift their teammates. A jumping player cannot be tackled until they stand and only shoulder-to-shoulder contact is allowed; deliberate infringement of this law is dangerous play, and results in a penalty kick.\nScrum.\nA scrum is a way of restarting the game safely and fairly after a minor infringement. It is awarded when the ball has been knocked or passed forward, if a player takes the ball over their own try line and puts the ball down, when a player is accidentally &lt;a href=\"Offside%20%28rugby%29%23Rugby%20union\"&gt;offside&lt;/a&gt; or when the ball is trapped in a ruck or maul with no realistic chance of being retrieved. A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty.\nA scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team crouching down and binding together in three rows, before interlocking with the opposing team. For each team, the front row consists of two props (loosehead and tighthead) either side of the hooker. The two props are typically amongst the strongest players on the team. The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. This formation is known as the 3\u20134\u20131 formation. Once a scrum is formed the scrum-half from the team awarded the \"feed\" rolls the ball into the gap between the two front-rows known as the \"tunnel\". The two hookers then compete for possession by hooking the ball backwards with their feet, while each pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards to help gain possession. The side that wins possession can either keep the ball under their feet while driving the opposition back, in order to gain ground, or transfer the ball to the back of the scrum where it can be picked up by the number 8 or by the scrum-half.\nOfficials and offences.\nThere are three match officials: a referee, and two assistant referees. The referees are commonly addressed as \"Sir\". The latter, formerly known as touch judges, had the primary function of indicating when the ball had gone into \"touch\"; their role has been expanded and they are now expected to assist the referee in a number of areas, such as watching for foul play and checking offside lines. In addition, for matches in high level competitions, there is often a television match official (TMO; popularly called the \"video referee\"), to assist with certain decisions, linked up to the referee by radio. The referees have a system of hand signals to indicate their decisions.\nCommon offences include tackling above the shoulders, collapsing a &lt;a href=\"Scrum%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;scrum&lt;/a&gt;, ruck or maul, not releasing the ball when on the ground, or being offside. The non-offending team has a number of options when awarded a penalty: a \"tap\" kick, when the ball is kicked a very short distance from hand, allowing the kicker to regather the ball and run with it; a punt, when the ball is kicked a long distance from hand, for field position; a place-kick, when the kicker will attempt to score a goal; or a scrum. Players may be sent off (signalled by a &lt;a href=\"Red%20card%20%28sports%29\"&gt;red card&lt;/a&gt;) or temporarily suspended (\"sin-binned\") for ten minutes (&lt;a href=\"Yellow%20card%20%28sport%29\"&gt;yellow card&lt;/a&gt;) for foul play or repeated infringements, and may not be replaced.\nOccasionally, infringements are not caught by the referee during the match and these may be \"cited\" by the &lt;a href=\"citing%20commissioner\"&gt;citing commissioner&lt;/a&gt; after the match and have punishments (usually suspension for a number of weeks) imposed on the infringing player.\nReplacements and substitutions.\nDuring the match, players may be replaced (for injury) or substituted (for tactical reasons). A player who has been replaced may not rejoin play unless he was temporarily replaced to have bleeding controlled; a player who has been substituted may return temporarily, to replace a player who has a blood injury or has suffered a concussion, or permanently, if he is replacing a front-row forward. In international matches, eight replacements are allowed; in domestic or cross-border tournaments, at the discretion of the responsible national union(s), the number of replacements may be nominated to a maximum of eight, of whom three must be sufficiently trained and experienced to provide cover for the three front row positions.\nPrior to 2016, all substitutions, no matter the cause, counted against the limit during a match. In 2016, &lt;a href=\"World%20Rugby\"&gt;World Rugby&lt;/a&gt; changed the law so that substitutions made to replace a player deemed unable to continue due to foul play by the opposition would no longer count against the match limit. This change was introduced in January of that year in the Southern Hemisphere and June in the Northern Hemisphere.\nEquipment.\nThe most basic items of equipment for a game of rugby union are the ball itself, a &lt;a href=\"rugby%20shirt\"&gt;rugby shirt&lt;/a&gt; (also known as a \"jersey\"), &lt;a href=\"rugby%20shorts\"&gt;rugby shorts&lt;/a&gt;, socks, and &lt;a href=\"Football%20boot%23Different%20styles%20for%20different%20sports\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"rugby%20ball\"&gt;rugby ball&lt;/a&gt; is oval in shape (technically a &lt;a href=\"prolate%20spheroid\"&gt;prolate spheroid&lt;/a&gt;), and is made up of four panels. The ball was historically made of leather, but in the modern era most games use a ball made from a synthetic material. World Rugby lays out specific dimensions for the ball, in length, in circumference of length and in circumference of width. Rugby boots have soles with studs to allow grip on the turf of the pitch. The studs may be either metal or plastic but must not have any sharp edges or ridges.\nProtective equipment is optional and strictly regulated. The most common items are &lt;a href=\"mouthguard\"&gt;mouthguard&lt;/a&gt;s, which are worn by almost all players, and are compulsory in some rugby-playing nations. Other protective items that are permitted include &lt;a href=\"scrum%20cap\"&gt;head gear&lt;/a&gt;; thin (not more than 10\u00a0mm thick), non-rigid shoulder pads and &lt;a href=\"shin%20guard\"&gt;shin guard&lt;/a&gt;s; which are worn underneath socks. Bandages or tape can be worn to support or protect injuries; some players wear tape around the head to protect the ears in scrums and rucks. Female players may also wear chest pads. Although not worn for protection, some types of fingerless mitts are allowed to aid grip.\nIt is the responsibility of the match officials to check players' clothing and equipment before a game to ensure that it conforms to the laws of the game.\nGoverning bodies.\nThe international governing body of rugby union (and associated games such as sevens) is World Rugby (WR). The WR headquarters are in &lt;a href=\"Dublin\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, Ireland. WR, founded in 1886, governs the sport worldwide and publishes the game's laws and &lt;a href=\"IRB%20World%20Rankings\"&gt;rankings&lt;/a&gt;. As of February 2014, WR (then known as the IRB, for International Rugby Board) recorded 119 unions in its membership, 101 full members and 18 associate member countries. According to WR, rugby union is played by men and women in over 100 countries. WR controls the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Women's Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20World%20Cup%20Sevens\"&gt;Rugby World Cup Sevens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"World%20Rugby%20Sevens%20Series\"&gt;HSBC Sevens Series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"World%20Rugby%20Women%27s%20Sevens%20Series\"&gt;HSBC Women's Sevens Series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"World%20Rugby%20Under%2020%20Championship\"&gt;World Under 20 Championship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"World%20Rugby%20Under%2020%20Trophy\"&gt;World Under 20 Trophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"World%20Rugby%20Nations%20Cup\"&gt;Nations Cup&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Nations%20Cup\"&gt;Pacific Nations Cup&lt;/a&gt;. WR holds votes to decide where each of these events are to be held, except in the case of the Sevens World Series for men and women, for which WR contracts with several national unions to hold individual events.\nSix regional associations, which are members of WR, form the next level of administration; these are:\n&lt;a href=\"SANZAAR\"&gt;SANZAAR&lt;/a&gt; (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) is a joint venture of the &lt;a href=\"South%20African%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;South African Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20Rugby\"&gt;New Zealand Rugby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Australia\"&gt;Rugby Australia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Argentine Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; (UAR) that operates &lt;a href=\"Super%20Rugby\"&gt;Super Rugby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;The Rugby Championship&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the Tri Nations before the entry of Argentina). Although UAR initially had no representation on the former SANZAR board, it was granted input into the organisation's issues, especially with regard to The Rugby Championship, and became a full SANZAAR member in 2016 (when the country entered Super Rugby).\nNational unions oversee rugby union within individual countries and are affiliated to WR. Since 2016, the WR Council has 40 seats. A total of 11 unions\u2014the eight foundation unions of &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Irish%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and &lt;a href=\"French%20Rugby%20Federation\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, plus Argentina, and \u2014have two seats each. In addition, the six regional associations have two seats each. Four more unions\u2014, , and the &lt;a href=\"USA%20Rugby\"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;\u2014have one seat each. Finally, the chairman and Vice Chairman, who usually come from one of the eight foundation unions (although the current Vice Chairman, &lt;a href=\"Agust%C3%ADn%20Pichot\"&gt;Agust\u00edn Pichot&lt;/a&gt;, is with the non-foundation Argentine union) have one vote each.\nGlobal reach.\nThe earliest countries to adopt rugby union were &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, the country of inception, and the other three Home Nations, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Scotland\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Ireland\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Wales\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. The spread of rugby union as a global sport has its roots in the exporting of the game by British expatriates, military personnel, and overseas university students.\nThe first rugby club in &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; was formed by British residents in Le Havre in 1872, while the next year &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; recorded its first game: 'Banks' v 'City' in Buenos Aires.\nSeven countries have adopted rugby union as their de facto &lt;a href=\"national%20sport\"&gt;national sport&lt;/a&gt;; they are &lt;a href=\"Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Georgia\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Madagascar\"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samoa\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Tonga\"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt; and Wales.\nOceania.\nA rugby club was formed in Sydney, &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in 1864; while the sport was said to have been introduced to &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Charles%20John%20Monro\"&gt;Charles Monro&lt;/a&gt; in 1870, who played rugby while a student at &lt;a href=\"Christ%27s%20College%20%28Finchley%29\"&gt;Christ's College, Finchley&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral island nations have embraced the sport of rugby. Rugby was first played in &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; circa 1884 by European and Fijian soldiers of the Native Constabulary at &lt;a href=\"Ba%20%28town%29\"&gt;Ba&lt;/a&gt; on Viti Levu island. Fiji then sent their first overseas team to &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Samoa\"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt; in 1924, who in turn set up their own &lt;a href=\"Lakapi%20Samoa\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt; in 1924. Along with &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Tonga\"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;, other countries to have national rugby teams in Oceania include &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20the%20Cook%20Islands\"&gt;the Cook Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Niue\"&gt;Niue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Papua%20New%20Guinea\"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Solomon%20Islands\"&gt;Solomon Islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorth America and Caribbean.\nIn North America a club formed in Montreal in 1868, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Canada\"&gt;Canada's&lt;/a&gt; first club. The city of Montreal also played its part in the introduction of the sport in the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, when students of &lt;a href=\"McGill%20University\"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt; played against a team from &lt;a href=\"Harvard%20University\"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; in 1874. The two variants of gridiron football \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20football\"&gt;Canadian football&lt;/a&gt; and, to a lesser extent, &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 were once considered forms of &lt;a href=\"rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby football&lt;/a&gt; but are seldom now referred to as such. In fact, the governing body of Canadian football, &lt;a href=\"Football%20Canada%231880%E2%80%931955%2C%20Canadian%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Football Canada&lt;/a&gt;, was known as the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU) as late as 1967, more than fifty years after the sport parted ways with the established rules of rugby union. The &lt;a href=\"Grey%20Cup\"&gt;Grey Cup&lt;/a&gt;, the trophy awarded to the victorious team playing in the namesake championship of the professional &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Football%20League\"&gt;Canadian Football League&lt;/a&gt; (CFL), was originally awarded to the champion of the CRU. The two strongest leagues in the CRU, the &lt;a href=\"Interprovincial%20Rugby%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Interprovincial Rugby Football Union&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Canada\"&gt;Eastern Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Interprovincial%20Football%20Union\"&gt;Western Interprovincial Football Union&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Canada\"&gt;Western Canada&lt;/a&gt;, evolved into the present day CFL.\nAlthough the exact date of arrival of &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union%20in%20Trinidad%20and%20Tobago\"&gt;rugby union in Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt; is unknown, their first club Northern RFC was formed in 1923, a national team was playing by 1927 and due to a cancelled tour to &lt;a href=\"British%20Guiana\"&gt;British Guiana&lt;/a&gt; in 1933, switched their venue to &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Barbados\"&gt;Barbados&lt;/a&gt;; introducing rugby to the island. Other Atlantic countries to play rugby union include &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Jamaica\"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Bermuda\"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"College%20rugby\"&gt;Rugby union&lt;/a&gt; is the fastest growing &lt;a href=\"college%20sport\"&gt;college sport&lt;/a&gt; and sport in general in the USA.\n&lt;a href=\"Major%20League%20Rugby\"&gt;Major League Rugby&lt;/a&gt; is the professional Rugby union competition in the US and Canada.\nEurope.\nThe growth of rugby union in &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; outside the 6 Nations countries in terms of playing numbers, &lt;a href=\"attendance\"&gt;attendance&lt;/a&gt;s, and viewership has been sporadic. Historically, British and Irish home teams played the Southern Hemisphere teams of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as France. The rest of Europe were left to play amongst themselves. During a period when it had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France, lacking international competition, became the only European team from the top tier to regularly play the other European countries; mainly &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Romania\"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1934, instigated by the &lt;a href=\"French%20Rugby%20Federation\"&gt;French Rugby Federation&lt;/a&gt;, FIRA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Rugby Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the IRFB. The founding members were , , , , , and .\nOther European rugby playing nations of note include &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, whose first officially recorded match is marked by an encounter between &lt;a href=\"Dynamo%20Moscow\"&gt;Dynamo Moscow&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Institute%20of%20Physical%20Education\"&gt;Moscow Institute of Physical Education&lt;/a&gt; in 1933. &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Portugal\"&gt;Rugby union in Portugal&lt;/a&gt; also took hold between the First and Second World Wars, with a Portuguese National XV set up in 1922 and an official championship started in 1927.\nIn 1999, FIRA agreed to place itself under the auspices of the IRB, transforming itself into a strictly European organising body. Accordingly, it changed its name to FIRA\u2013AER (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Rugby Amateur \u2013 Association Europ\u00e9enne de Rugby). It adopted its current name of &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Europe\"&gt;Rugby Europe&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.\nSouth America.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; is the best-known rugby playing nation in &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, founding the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Argentine Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; in 1899, several other countries on the continent have a long history. Rugby had been played in &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; since the end of the 19th century, but the game was played regularly only from 1926, when S\u00e3o Paulo beat Santos in an inter-city match. It took &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Uruguay\"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; several aborted attempts to adapt to rugby, led mainly by the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Montevideo%20Cricket%20Club\"&gt;Montevideo Cricket Club&lt;/a&gt;; these efforts succeeded in 1951 with the formation of a national league and four clubs. Other South American countries that formed a rugby union include &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; (1948), and &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Paraguay\"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt; (1968).\n&lt;a href=\"S%C3%BAper%20Liga%20Americana%20de%20Rugby\"&gt;S\u00faper Liga Americana de Rugby&lt;/a&gt; is the professional Rugby union competition in &lt;a href=\"South%20America\"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;.\nAsia.\nMany Asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby dating from the British Empire. &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; began playing rugby in the early 1870s, the &lt;a href=\"Calcutta%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Calcutta Football Club&lt;/a&gt; forming in 1873. However, with the departure of a local British army regiment, interest in rugby diminished in the area. In 1878, The Calcutta Football Club was disbanded, and rugby in India faltered. &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; claims to have founded their union in 1878, and although little official information from the period is available, the team won the All-India cup in Madras in 1920. The first recorded match in &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; was in 1892, but the first confirmation of rugby is the existence of the \"HMS Malaya Cup\" which was first presented in 1922 and is still awarded to the winners of the Malay sevens.\nRugby union was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; in 1899 by two Cambridge students: &lt;a href=\"Ginnosuke%20Tanaka\"&gt;Ginnosuke Tanaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Bramwell%20Clarke\"&gt;Edward Bramwell Clarke&lt;/a&gt;. The Japan RFU was founded in 1926 and its place in rugby history was cemented when Japan hosted the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2019 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first country outside the Commonwealth, Ireland and France to host the event, and was viewed by the IRB as an opportunity for rugby union to extend its reach, particularly in Asia. Other Asian playing countries of note include &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20South%20Korea\"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;The Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, while the former British colony of &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; is notable within rugby for its development of the rugby sevens game, especially the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Sevens\"&gt;Hong Kong Sevens&lt;/a&gt; tournament which was founded in 1976.\nRugby in the Middle East and the Gulf States has its history in the 1950s, with clubs formed by British and French Services stationed in the region after the Second World War. When these servicemen left, the clubs and teams were kept alive by young professionals, mostly Europeans, working in these countries. The official union of &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Oman\"&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt; was formed in 1971. &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Bahrain\"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt; founded its union a year later, while in 1975 the &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Sevens\"&gt;Dubai Sevens&lt;/a&gt;, the Gulf's leading rugby tournament, was created. Rugby remains a minority sport in the region with &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20United%20Arab%20Emirates\"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;, as of 2019, being the only member union from the Middle East to be included in the &lt;a href=\"IRB%20World%20Rankings\"&gt;IRB World Rankings&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfrica.\nIn 1875, rugby was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; by British soldiers garrisoned in Cape Town. The game spread quickly across the country, displacing &lt;a href=\"Winchester%20College%20football\"&gt;Winchester College football&lt;/a&gt; as the sport of choice in South Africa and spreading to nearby &lt;a href=\"Zimbabwe\"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;. South African settlers also brought the game with them to Namibia and competed against British administrators in &lt;a href=\"British%20East%20Africa\"&gt;British East Africa&lt;/a&gt;. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the sport in Africa was spread by settlers and colonials who often adopted a \"whites-only\" policy to playing the game. This resulted in rugby being viewed as a &lt;a href=\"bourgeois\"&gt;bourgeois&lt;/a&gt; sport by the indigenous people with limited appeal. Despite this enclaves of black participation developed notably in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Cape\"&gt;Eastern Cape&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Harare\"&gt;Harare&lt;/a&gt;. The earliest countries to see the playing of competitive rugby include South Africa, and neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Rhodesia\"&gt;Rhodesia&lt;/a&gt; (modern-day Zimbabwe), which formed the Rhodesia Rugby Football Union in 1895 and became a regular stop for touring British and New Zealand sides.\nIn more recent times the sport has been embraced by several African nations. In the early 21st century &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Madagascar\"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt; has experienced crowds of 40,000 at national matches, while Namibia, whose history of rugby can be dated from 1915, have qualified for the final stages of the World Cup four times since 1999. Other African nations to be represented in the World Rugby Rankings as Member Unions include &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20C%C3%B4te%20d%27Ivoire\"&gt;C\u00f4te d'Ivoire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Kenya\"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Uganda\"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Zambia\"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;. South Africa and Kenya are among the 15 \"core teams\" that participate in every event of the men's &lt;a href=\"World%20Rugby%20Sevens%20Series\"&gt;World Rugby Sevens Series&lt;/a&gt;.\nWomen's rugby union.\nRecords of women's rugby football date from the late 19th century, with the first documented source being &lt;a href=\"Emily%20Valentine\"&gt;Emily Valentine&lt;/a&gt;'s writings, in which she states that she set up a rugby team in &lt;a href=\"Portora%20Royal%20School\"&gt;Portora Royal School&lt;/a&gt; in Enniskillen, Ireland in 1887. Although there are reports of early women's matches in New Zealand and France, one of the first notable games to prove primary evidence was the 1917 war-time encounter between Cardiff Ladies and Newport Ladies; a photo of which shows the Cardiff team before the match at the &lt;a href=\"Cardiff%20Arms%20Park\"&gt;Cardiff Arms Park&lt;/a&gt;. Since the 1980s, the game has grown in popularity among female athletes, and by 2010, according to &lt;a href=\"World%20Rugby\"&gt;World Rugby&lt;/a&gt;, women's rugby was being played in over 100 countries.\nThe English-based Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU), responsible for women's rugby in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, was founded in 1983, and is the oldest formally organised national governing body for women's rugby. This was replaced in 1994 by the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20Football%20Union%20for%20Women\"&gt;Rugby Football Union for Women&lt;/a&gt; (RFUW) in England with each of the other Home Nations governing their own countries.\nThe premier international competition in rugby union for women is the &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Women's Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, first held in 1991; from 1994 through 2014, it was held every four years. After the 2014 event, the tournament was brought forward a year to 2017 to avoid clashing with other sporting cycles, in particular the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20World%20Cup%20Sevens\"&gt;Rugby World Cup Sevens&lt;/a&gt; competition. The Women's Rugby World Cup returned to a four-year cycle after 2017, with future competitions to be held in the middle year of the men's World Cup cycle.\nMajor international competitions.\nRugby World Cup.\nThe most important competition in rugby union is the &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, a men's tournament that has taken place every four years since the inaugural event in 1987. &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; are the reigning champions, having defeated England in the final of the &lt;a href=\"2019%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2019 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in Yokohama. &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and South Africa have each won the title three times (New Zealand: 1987, 2011, 2015; South Africa: 1995, 2007, 2019), Australia have won twice (1991 and 1999), and England once (2003). England is the only team from the Northern Hemisphere to have won the Rugby World Cup.\nThe Rugby World Cup has continued to grow since its inception in 1987. The Rugby League World Cup dates from 1954 in contrast. The first tournament, in which 16 teams competed for the title, was broadcast to 17 countries with an accumulated total of 230\u00a0million television viewers. Ticket sales during the pool stages and finals of the same tournament was less than a million. The &lt;a href=\"2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2007 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; was contested by 94 countries with ticket sales of 3,850,000 over the pool and final stage. The accumulated television audience for the event, then broadcast to 200 countries, was a claimed 4.2\u00a0billion.\nThe 2019 Rugby World Cup took place in Japan between 20 September and 2 November. It was the ninth edition and the first time the tournament has been held in Asia.\nRegional tournaments.\nMajor international competitions are the &lt;a href=\"Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;Six Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Rugby%20Championship\"&gt;The Rugby Championship&lt;/a&gt;, held in Europe and the Southern Hemisphere respectively.\nThe Six Nations is an annual competition involving the European teams , , , , and . Each country plays the other five once. Following the first internationals between England and Scotland, Ireland and Wales began competing in the 1880s, forming the \"Home International Championships\". France joined the tournament in the 1900s and in 1910 the term \"Five Nations\" first appeared. However, the &lt;a href=\"Home%20Nations\"&gt;Home Nations&lt;/a&gt; (England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) excluded France in 1931 amid a run of poor results, allegations of professionalism and concerns over on-field violence. France then rejoined in 1939\u20131940, though World War II halted proceedings for a further eight years. France has played in all the tournaments since WWII, the first of which was played in 1947. In 2000, Italy became the sixth nation in the contest and Rome's &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Olimpico\"&gt;Stadio Olimpico&lt;/a&gt; has replaced &lt;a href=\"Stadio%20Flaminio\"&gt;Stadio Flaminio&lt;/a&gt; as the venue for their home games since 2013.\nThe Rugby Championship is the Southern Hemisphere's annual international series for that region's top national teams. From its inception in 1996 through 2011, it was known as the Tri Nations, as it featured the hemisphere's traditional powers of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. These teams have dominated world rankings in recent years, and many considered the Tri Nations to be the toughest competition in international rugby. The Tri Nations was initially played on a home and away basis with the three nations playing each other twice.\nIn 2006 a new system was introduced where each nation plays the others three times, though in 2007 and 2011 the teams played each other only twice, as both were World Cup years. Since Argentina's strong performances in the 2007 World Cup, after the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, &lt;a href=\"SANZAAR\"&gt;SANZAR&lt;/a&gt; (South Africa, New Zealand and Australian Rugby) invited the &lt;a href=\"Argentine%20Rugby%20Union\"&gt;Argentine Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt; (UAR) to join an expanded Four Nations tournament in 2012. The competition has been officially rechristened as The Rugby Championship beginning with the 2012 edition. The competition reverted to the Tri Nations' original home-and-away format, but now involving four teams. In World Cup years, an abbreviated tournament is held in which each team plays the others only once.\nRugby within multi-sport events.\nRugby union was played at the Olympic Games in &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20at%20the%201900%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1900&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20at%20the%201908%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1908&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20at%20the%201920%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1920&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20at%20the%201924%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1924&lt;/a&gt;. As per Olympic rules, the nations of Scotland, Wales and England were not allowed to play separately as they are not sovereign states. In 1900, France won the gold, beating Great Britain 27 points to 8 and defeating Germany 27 points to 17. In 1908, Australia defeated Great Britain, claiming the gold medal, the score being 32 points to three. In 1920, the United States, fielding a team with many players new to the sport of rugby, upset France in a shock win, eight points to zero. In 1924, the United States again defeated France 17 to 3, becoming the only team to win gold twice in the sport.\nIn 2009 the &lt;a href=\"International%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; voted with a majority of 81 to 8 that rugby union be reinstated as an Olympic sport in at least the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2020%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt; games, but in the sevens, 4-day tournament format. This is something the rugby world has aspired to for a long time and &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Lapasset\"&gt;Bernard Lapasset&lt;/a&gt;, president of the International Rugby Board, said the Olympic gold medal would be considered to be \"the pinnacle of our sport\" (Rugby Sevens).\nRugby sevens has been played at the &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Rugby%20Sevens%20Championships\"&gt;Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;1998 Games&lt;/a&gt; in Kuala Lumpur. The most gold medal holders are &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20sevens%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; who have won the competition on four successive occasions until South Africa beat them in 2014. Rugby union has also been an &lt;a href=\"Asian%20Games\"&gt;Asian Games&lt;/a&gt; event since the &lt;a href=\"1998%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;1998 games&lt;/a&gt; in Bangkok, Thailand. In the 1998 and 2002 editions of the games, both the usual fifteen-a-side variety and rugby sevens were played, but from 2006 onwards, only rugby sevens was retained. In 2010, the women's rugby sevens event was introduced. The event is likely to remain a permanent fixture of the Asian Games due to elevation of rugby sevens as an Olympic sport from the 2016 Olympics onwards. The present gold medal holders in the sevens tournament, held in &lt;a href=\"2014%20Asian%20Games\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, are &lt;a href=\"Japan%20national%20rugby%20sevens%20team\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; in the men's event and &lt;a href=\"China%20women%27s%20national%20rugby%20sevens%20team\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; in the women's.\nWomen's international rugby.\nWomen's international rugby union began in 1982, with a match between &lt;a href=\"France%20women%27s%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands%20women%27s%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; played in &lt;a href=\"Utrecht%20%28city%29\"&gt;Utrecht&lt;/a&gt;. As of 2009 over six hundred women's internationals have been played by over forty different nations.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Women's Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; was held in Wales &lt;a href=\"1991%20Women%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;in 1991&lt;/a&gt;, and was won by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20women%27s%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The second tournament took place in &lt;a href=\"1994%20Women%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt;, and from that time through 2014 was held every four years. The New Zealand Women's team then won four straight World Cups (&lt;a href=\"1998%20Women%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2002%20Women%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2006%20Women%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2010%20Women%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;) before &lt;a href=\"England%20women%27s%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; won in &lt;a href=\"2014%20Women%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;. Following the 2014 event, World Rugby moved the next edition of the event to &lt;a href=\"2017%20Women%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, with a new four-year cycle from that point forward. New Zealand are the current World Cup holders.\nAs well as the Women's Rugby World Cup there are also other regular tournaments, including a &lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;Six Nations&lt;/a&gt;, run in parallel to the men's competition. The Women's Six Nations, first played in &lt;a href=\"1996%20Women%27s%20Home%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt; has been dominated by England, who have won the tournament on 14 occasions, including a run of seven consecutive wins from &lt;a href=\"2006%20Women%27s%20Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"2012%20Women%27s%20Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;. However, since then, England have won only in &lt;a href=\"2017%20Women%27s%20Six%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;; reigning champion France have won in each even-numbered year (2014, 2016, 2018) whilst &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20women%27s%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; won in 2013 and 2015.\nProfessional rugby union.\nRugby union has been professionalised since 1995. The following table shows professional and semi-professional rugby union competitions.\nVariants.\nRugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 15-a-side game. The two most common differences in adapted versions are fewer players and reduced player contact.\nThe oldest variant is &lt;a href=\"rugby%20sevens\"&gt;rugby sevens&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes 7s or VIIs), a fast-paced game which originated in &lt;a href=\"Melrose%2C%20Scottish%20Borders\"&gt;Melrose&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes. Major tournaments include the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Sevens\"&gt;Hong Kong Sevens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dubai%20Sevens\"&gt;Dubai Sevens&lt;/a&gt;, both held in areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side game.\nA more recent variant of the sport is &lt;a href=\"rugby%20tens\"&gt;rugby tens&lt;/a&gt; (10s or Xs), a Malaysian invention with ten players per side.\n&lt;a href=\"Touch%20rugby\"&gt;Touch rugby&lt;/a&gt;, in which \"tackles\" are made by simply touching the ball carrier with two hands, is popular both as a training game and more formally as a mixed sex version of the sport played by both children and adults.\nSeveral variants have been created to introduce the sport to children with a less physical contact. &lt;a href=\"Mini%20rugby\"&gt;Mini rugby&lt;/a&gt; is a version aimed at fostering the sport in children. It is played with only eight players and on a smaller pitch.\n&lt;a href=\"Tag%20Rugby\"&gt;Tag Rugby&lt;/a&gt; is a version in which the players wear a belt with two tags attached by velcro, the removal of either counting as a 'tackle'. Tag Rugby also varies in that kicking the ball is not allowed. Similar to Tag Rugby, &lt;a href=\"American%20Flag%20Rugby\"&gt;American Flag Rugby&lt;/a&gt;, (AFR), is a mixed gender, non-contact imitation of rugby union designed for American children entering grades K-9. Both American Flag Rugby and Mini Rugby differ from Tag Rugby in that they introduce more advanced elements of rugby union as the participants age.\nOther less formal variants include &lt;a href=\"beach%20rugby\"&gt;beach rugby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"snow%20rugby\"&gt;snow rugby&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluence on other sports.\n&lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league\"&gt;Rugby league&lt;/a&gt; was formed after the Northern Union broke from the Rugby Football Union in a disagreement over payment to players. It went on to change its laws and became a &lt;a href=\"football%20code\"&gt;football code&lt;/a&gt; in its own right. The two sports continue to influence each other to this day.\n&lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20football\"&gt;Canadian football&lt;/a&gt; are derived from early forms of rugby football.\n&lt;a href=\"Australian%20rules%20football\"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt; was influenced by &lt;a href=\"rugby%20football\"&gt;rugby football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"English%20public%20school%20football%20games\"&gt;other games originating in English public schools&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"James%20Naismith\"&gt;James Naismith&lt;/a&gt; took aspects of many sports including rugby to invent &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;. The most obvious contribution is the &lt;a href=\"jump%20ball\"&gt;jump ball&lt;/a&gt;'s similarity to the line-out as well as the underhand shooting style that dominated the early years of the sport. Naismith played rugby at &lt;a href=\"McGill%20University\"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Swedish%20football%20%28code%29\"&gt;Swedish football&lt;/a&gt; was a code whose rules were a mix of &lt;a href=\"Laws%20of%20the%20Game%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;Association&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20football\"&gt;Rugby football rules&lt;/a&gt;.\nRugby lends its name to &lt;a href=\"wheelchair%20rugby\"&gt;wheelchair rugby&lt;/a&gt;, a full-contact sport which contains elements of rugby such as crossing a try line with the ball to score.\nStatistics and records.\nAccording to a 2011 report by the Centre for the International Business of Sport, over four and a half million people play rugby union or one of its variants organised by the IRB. This is an increase of 19 percent since the previous report in 2007. The report also claimed that since 2007 participation has grown by 33 percent in Africa, 22 percent in South America and 18 percent in Asia and North America. In 2014 the IRB published a breakdown of the total number of players worldwide by national unions. It recorded a total of 6.6\u00a0million players globally, of those, 2.36\u00a0million were registered members playing for a club affiliated to their country's union. The 2016 World Rugby Year in Review reported 8.5\u00a0million players, of which 3.2\u00a0million were registered union players and 1.9\u00a0million were registered club players; 22% of all players were female.\nThe most capped international player from the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20international%20rugby%20union%20teams%23Tier%201\"&gt;tier 1 nations&lt;/a&gt; is Welsh captain &lt;a href=\"Alun%20Wyn%20Jones\"&gt;Alun Wyn Jones&lt;/a&gt; who has played over 150 internationals.\nWhile the top scoring tier 1 international player is New Zealand's &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Carter\"&gt;Dan Carter&lt;/a&gt;, who has amassed 1442 points during his career. In April 2010 &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20union%20in%20Lithuania\"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; which is a second tier rugby nation, broke the record of consecutive international wins for second tier rugby nations. In 2016, the All Blacks of New Zealand set the new record 18 consecutive test wins among tier 1 rugby nations, bettering their previous consecutive run of 17. This record was equalled by England on 11 March 2017 with a win over Scotland at Twickenham. The highest scoring international match between two recognised unions was Hong Kong's 164\u201313 victory over Singapore on 27 October 1994. While the largest winning margin of 152 points is held by two countries, Japan (a 155\u20133 win over Chinese Taipei) and Argentina (152\u20130 over Paraguay) both in 2002.\nThe record attendance for a rugby union game was set on 15 July 2000 in which &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; 39\u201335 in a Bledisloe Cup game at &lt;a href=\"Stadium%20Australia\"&gt;Stadium Australia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; before 109,874 fans. The record attendance for a match in Europe of 104,000 (at the time a world record) was set on 1 March 1975 when &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; 12\u201310 at &lt;a href=\"Murrayfield%20Stadium\"&gt;Murrayfield&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"1975%20Five%20Nations%20Championship\"&gt;1975 Five Nations Championship&lt;/a&gt;. This crowd however is an estimate and contemporaneous newspaper accounts list a crowd of 80,000 only.
