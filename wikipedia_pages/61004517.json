    "text": "The Gwich\u02bcin Tribal Council is a First Nations organization representing the &lt;a href=\"Gwich%CA%BCin\"&gt;Gwich\u02bcin&lt;/a&gt; people of northern &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, owning approximately 23,884 square kilometres of land in &lt;a href=\"Yukon\"&gt;Yukon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Territories\"&gt;Northwest Territories&lt;/a&gt;. It was created in 1992 with the final ratification of the Gwich\u02bcin Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement with the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Government of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Negotiations to achieve a Final Agreement, and thus, Gwich\u02bcin self-government, are ongoing.\nHistory.\nThe Gwich\u02bcin people have been present in &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories since &lt;a href=\"time%20immemorial\"&gt;time immemorial&lt;/a&gt;. In 1921, chiefs and headmen representing the Gwich\u02bcin (then known as the Loucheux) population in Canada signed &lt;a href=\"Treaty%2011\"&gt;Treaty 11&lt;/a&gt;, but unresolved differences arose between the interpretation of aboriginal and treaty rights by the Gwich\u02bcin and by Canada, and many obligations were never fulfilled. To provide certainty and clarity of rights to land ownership, and to ensure various rights and benefits to the Gwich\u02bcin people, the Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement was signed as a modern treaty on April 22, 1992.\nPowers and responsibilities.\nAlthough not a full self-government, the Gwich\u02bcin Tribal Council has authority over planning and conservation within its jurisdiction, and exercises full ownership of various lands and organizations. These holdings include subsurface rights to certain parcels in the NWT, as well as the Gwich\u02bcin Development Corporation and Gwich\u02bcin Settlement Corporation. An additional Yukon Transboundary Agreement extends some of these rights into a part of neighbouring Yukon, provided that other &lt;a href=\"First%20Nations%20in%20Canada\"&gt;First Nations&lt;/a&gt; in that jurisdiction are co-operated with."
