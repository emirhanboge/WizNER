    "text": "The 2015\u201316 Northern Ireland Football League Cup (known as the JBE League Cup for sponsorship purposes) was the 30th edition of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland\"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; knock-out cup competition for national league clubs, and the third edition of the competition as the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Ireland%20Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Northern Ireland Football League Cup&lt;/a&gt;. This season's League Cup was sponsored by JBE Mechanical Electrical, and was contested by the 40 clubs in the &lt;a href=\"NIFL%20Premiership\"&gt;NIFL Premiership&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NIFL%20Championship%201\"&gt;NIFL Championship 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NIFL%20Championship%202\"&gt;NIFL Championship 2&lt;/a&gt;. The number of participants fell by one this season following &lt;a href=\"Ballymoney%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Ballymoney United&lt;/a&gt;'s relegation from the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20NIFL%20Championship%23Championship%202\"&gt;2014\u201315 NIFL Championship 2&lt;/a&gt; to regional football. The competition began on 18 August 2015 with the first round, and concluded on 13 February 2016 with the final at &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28football%20ground%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the third consecutive season &lt;a href=\"Cliftonville%20F.C.\"&gt;Cliftonville&lt;/a&gt; were the defending champions, following their 3\u20132 win over &lt;a href=\"Ballymena%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Ballymena United&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20Northern%20Ireland%20Football%20League%20Cup%23Final\"&gt;2015 final&lt;/a&gt;. This secured the trophy for the third consecutive season and the fourth time overall. This season they once again pulled off a successful defence of the Cup, defeating &lt;a href=\"NIFL%20Championship%201\"&gt;second-tier&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Ards%20F.C.\"&gt;Ards&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 in the final. In doing so, they became the first club ever to appear in, and win four consecutive League Cup finals. &lt;a href=\"Ards%20F.C.\"&gt;Ards&lt;/a&gt; reached the final for the first time in 21 years, and the third time overall. This marked only the second occasion in the competition's history that a club from outside the top flight had reached the final, the first being &lt;a href=\"Portadown%20F.C.\"&gt;Portadown&lt;/a&gt; (then of the second tier) in the &lt;a href=\"2008%E2%80%9309%20Irish%20League%20Cup\"&gt;2009 final&lt;/a&gt;. Ards' previous final appearance had also been against Cliftonville, when they won the Cup 2\u20130 on penalties after a 0\u20130 draw in &lt;a href=\"1994%E2%80%9395%20Irish%20League%20Cup\"&gt;1994\u201395&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormat and schedule.\nThe competition was played in a straight knock-out format and was open to the 40 members of the &lt;a href=\"NIFL%20Premiership\"&gt;NIFL Premiership&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NIFL%20Championship%201\"&gt;NIFL Championship 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NIFL%20Championship%202\"&gt;NIFL Championship 2&lt;/a&gt;. The top 16 ranked clubs from last season received byes into the second round, which included the 12 members of the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20NIFL%20Premiership\"&gt;2014\u201315 NIFL Premiership&lt;/a&gt; and the top four ranked clubs from the &lt;a href=\"2014%E2%80%9315%20NIFL%20Championship\"&gt;2014\u201315 NIFL Championship&lt;/a&gt;.
