    "text": "The 2013 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl is an American &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bowl%20game\"&gt;bowl game&lt;/a&gt; that was played on December 26, 2013 at &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Field\"&gt;Ford Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Detroit\"&gt;Detroit, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. The 17th edition of &lt;a href=\"Little%20Caesars%20Pizza%20Bowl\"&gt;Little Caesars Pizza Bowl&lt;/a&gt; featured the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football%20team\"&gt;Pittsburgh Panthers&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference\"&gt;Atlantic Coast Conference&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Bowling%20Green%20Falcons%20football%20team\"&gt;Bowling Green Falcons&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Mid-American%20Conference\"&gt;Mid-American Conference&lt;/a&gt;. It was one of the &lt;a href=\"2013%E2%80%9314%20NCAA%20football%20bowl%20games\"&gt;2013\u201314 bowl games&lt;/a&gt; that concluded the &lt;a href=\"2013%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season\"&gt;2013 FBS football season&lt;/a&gt;.\nPittsburgh defeated Bowling Green by a score of 30\u201327. Pittsburgh running back James Conner, who rushed for 229 yards, was named the game's &lt;a href=\"most%20valuable%20player\"&gt;most valuable player&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe game was the final edition of the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl; it was displaced by the &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Lane%20Bowl\"&gt;Quick Lane Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, organized by the &lt;a href=\"Detroit%20Lions\"&gt;Detroit Lions&lt;/a&gt;, beginning in 2014.\nTeams.\nThe 2013 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl marked the fourth time Pittsburgh and Bowling Green have played each other. Because Pittsburgh was not selected for one of the ACC's seven contractual bowl tie-ins and with the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten\"&gt;Big Ten&lt;/a&gt; having just seven bowl-eligible teams and not able to send a team to the Little Caesar's Pizza Bowl, Pittsburgh was selected. Pittsburgh came into the game holding a 2\u20131 lead in the series.\nPittsburgh.\nIn the Panthers' first season in the ACC, Pittsburgh finished 6th in the Coastal Division with a 6\u20136 (3\u20135 conference) record. The Panthers' offense was led by wide receivers Devin Street (who was unable to play in the game due to injuries) and Tyler Boyd, as well as senior quarterback &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Savage%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Tom Savage&lt;/a&gt;. Pittsburgh's defense was led by All-American defensive tackle &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Donald\"&gt;Aaron Donald&lt;/a&gt;, who entered the game with 10 sacks on the season. The Panthers were coached by &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Chryst\"&gt;Paul Chryst&lt;/a&gt;.\nBowling Green.\nBowling Green entered the game as the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Mid-American%20Conference%20football%20season\"&gt;Mid-American Conference&lt;/a&gt; champions. The Falcons finished 1st in the MAC East Division with a 10\u20133 (7\u20131 conference) record. In the &lt;a href=\"2013%20MAC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;2013 MAC Championship Game&lt;/a&gt;, BGSU defeated &lt;a href=\"2013%20Northern%20Illinois%20Huskies%20football%20team\"&gt;Northern Illinois&lt;/a&gt; 47\u201327 to spoil the Huskies' BCS hopes. The Falcons' offense was led by quarterback Matt Johnson, who entered the game with 3,195 passing yards and 23 passing touchdowns. BGSU's defense led the MAC in scoring, rushing, passing and total defense. The Falcons were coached by Adam Scheier, who took over head coaching duties after &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Clawson\"&gt;Dave Clawson&lt;/a&gt; agreed to become the head coach at &lt;a href=\"Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20football\"&gt;Wake Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nGame summary.\nBGSU scored first on a 28-yard field goal from Tyler Tate.

Pittsburgh took a 17\u20133 lead after the Panthers' Tyler Boyd returned a punt 54-yards for a touchdown. On the ensuing drive, Bowling Green looked like it would have to punt inside their own 30-yard line after Matt Johnson was sacked. However, an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was called on Pittsburgh defensive tackle &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Donald\"&gt;Aaron Donald&lt;/a&gt;, giving the Falcons a first down. Bowling Green would later score on the drive on a 29-yard touchdown pass from Matt Johnson to Alex Bayer to make it 17\u201310. The game remained 17\u201310 going into the half. Pittsburgh quarterback &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Savage%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Tom Savage&lt;/a&gt; suffered a rib injury in the first half of the game and was unable to play in the second half. Savage was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Chad%20Voytik\"&gt;Chad Voytik&lt;/a&gt; for the second half of the game.\nBowling Green tied the game 17\u201317 on the first play in the second half with a 94-yard kickoff return by BooBoo Gates.

Pittsburgh retook the lead on a 39-yard field goal from Chris Blewitt with 1:17 remaining in the game. Bowling Green had one final chance to tie or win the game. However, after the Falcons committed a holding penalty and Matt Johnson was sacked on back-to-back plays, the Falcons needed to convert a 4th and 40 situation to continue the drive. The Falcons were unable to convert, however, sealing the victory for Pittsburgh.\nStatistics.\nPittsburgh running back James Conner was named the game's &lt;a href=\"most%20valuable%20player\"&gt;most valuable player&lt;/a&gt;.
