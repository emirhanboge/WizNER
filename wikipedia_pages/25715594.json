His subtle phrasing and amazing tone leave one breathless. Words cannot adequately describe the impression his recordings make. One must experience them to believe it. I can still hardly believe it myself.\"\nErika Borsos: \"This reviewer is familiar with the three B's of classical music: Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms and can distinguish their styles, one can *now* add a fourth \"B\" which stands for \"Balkan\" as played by Tale Ognenovski.

The labyrinthine musical pathways he creates are enormously pleasing to the listener. The pentatonic scale and odd metered rhythms of Macedonia awaken the listener to new vistas of musical excitement and enjoyment.

The composer of many tunes that have become standards, he is today the leader of his own group, and a master of the more Westernised style that become prominent in the 1940s and 50s.
