    "text": "There are six national parks in the &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Kingdom of Denmark&lt;/a&gt;; five in Denmark proper and one in &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first national park in Denmark proper was &lt;a href=\"Thy%20National%20Park\"&gt;Thy National Park&lt;/a&gt; (), created in 2008. It is located in &lt;a href=\"Thisted%20Municipality\"&gt;Thisted Municipality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Region%20Nordjylland\"&gt;Nordjylland&lt;/a&gt;. The park is a narrow stretch of land along the &lt;a href=\"North%20Jutlandic%20Island\"&gt;North Jutlandic Island&lt;/a&gt;'s west coast from &lt;a href=\"Hanstholm\"&gt;Hanstholm&lt;/a&gt; southward to &lt;a href=\"Agger%20Tange\"&gt;Agger Tange&lt;/a&gt;, excluding Hanstholm, Klitm\u00f8ller, N\u00f8rre Vorup\u00f8r, Stenbjerg and Agger. Thy National Park is named after &lt;a href=\"Thy%20%28district%29\"&gt;Thy&lt;/a&gt;, an area that includes not only today's national park but also adjacent land further east. The park has dunes, &lt;a href=\"Heath%20%28habitat%29\"&gt;heath&lt;/a&gt;, forests and grassland and also covers several small lakes and a small part of the &lt;a href=\"Limfjord\"&gt;Limfjord&lt;/a&gt;, which is the fjord that separates the North Jutlandic Island from the &lt;a href=\"Jutland%20Peninsula\"&gt;Cimbrian Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn August 2009, the second national park &lt;a href=\"Mols%20Bjerge%20National%20Park\"&gt;Mols Bjerge National Park&lt;/a&gt; was inaugurated, followed by &lt;a href=\"Wadden%20Sea%20National%20Park%2C%20Denmark\"&gt;Wadden Sea National Park&lt;/a&gt; in October 2010, and &lt;a href=\"Land%20of%20the%20Scylding%20National%20Park\"&gt;Land of the Scylding National Park&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. Two additional areas in mainland Denmark were proposed in 2008 and 2009 to become national parks. One of these plans, Skjern \u00c5 Nationalpark (after the &lt;a href=\"Skjern%20River\"&gt;river of the same name&lt;/a&gt;), was abandoned in 2012, but it was restarted in 2018 and is ongoing. The other, &lt;a href=\"Kongernes%20Nordsj%C3%A6lland%20National%20Park\"&gt;Kongernes Nordsj\u00e6lland National Park&lt;/a&gt;, was inaugurated in 2018.\nGreenland has had its own national park since 1974. The &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Greenland%20National%20Park\"&gt;Northeast Greenland National Park&lt;/a&gt; stretches across three fifths of the northern parts of &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;'s east coast and, since its expansion in 1988, two thirds of the eastern parts of Greenland's north coast. Bounded by the coasts, the park covers the island's entire north-eastern quarter, all of which is almost uninhabited. \nLike Greenland, the &lt;a href=\"Faroe%20Islands\"&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/a&gt; forms another &lt;a href=\"Autonomous%20administrative%20division\"&gt;autonomous region&lt;/a&gt; of the Kingdom of Denmark, but contains no national parks.\nFootnotes.\nNotes\nReferences"
