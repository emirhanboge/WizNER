    "text": "WOBN is an American &lt;a href=\"college%20radio\"&gt;college radio&lt;/a&gt; station owned and operated on 97.5\u00a0MHz &lt;a href=\"FM%20broadcasting\"&gt;FM&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Otterbein%20College\"&gt;Otterbein College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westerville%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Westerville, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. The station's studio is located at 33 Collegeview Road and tower is located at Cowan Hall on the campus of Otterbein College.\nThe station began operations in 1948 as an &lt;a href=\"AM%20broadcasting\"&gt;AM&lt;/a&gt; station with the callsign of WOBC. In 1968, the station's programming moved to the FM band on 91.5 FM. In the early 1980s, the station changed frequencies to 105.7\u00a0MHz - a frequency located within the current commercial portion of the FM band. In 1989, the FCC required that Otterbein relinquish the commercial frequency to make room for a new commercial station in &lt;a href=\"Marysville%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Marysville&lt;/a&gt; (now licensed to &lt;a href=\"Hilliard%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Hilliard&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"WXZX\"&gt;WXZX&lt;/a&gt;). In 1990, WOBN-FM moved to the frequency of 101.5\u00a0MHz. In November 2008 WOBN moved once again to the present frequency of 97.5.\nProgramming.\nBecause WOBN is a student-run college radio station, its lineup and content change frequently as new students enter and experienced students graduate. In addition to WOBN's formatted music programming, the station's mission statement includes supporting local athletes and early airplay of major and independent label new releases.\nWOBN-FM is the voice for all Otterbein &lt;a href=\"american%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"baseball\"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; teams, as well as many of Westerville's other local sports."
