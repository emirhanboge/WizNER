    "text": "Eastern Bengali is a &lt;a href=\"Nonstandard%20dialect\"&gt;nonstandard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dialect%20cluster\"&gt;dialect cluster&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20language\"&gt;Bengali&lt;/a&gt; spoken in most of &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tripura\"&gt;Tripura&lt;/a&gt;, as well as parts of &lt;a href=\"Assam\"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manipur\"&gt;Manipur&lt;/a&gt;, thus covering majority of the land of &lt;a href=\"Bengal\"&gt;Bengal&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding areas. It includes most of the &lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;varieties&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern subgroup of &lt;a href=\"Bengali-Assamese%20languages\"&gt;Bengali-Assamese languages&lt;/a&gt;.\nNames.\nIt is also known as Ba\u1e45g\u0101l\u012b (), P\u016brvava\u1e45g\u012b\u1e8fa (), Pr\u0101cya (), Va\u1e45ga (), or Va\u1e45g\u012b\u1e8fa (). Eastern Bengali is often colloquially referred to by the &lt;a href=\"exonym\"&gt;exonym&lt;/a&gt; Bangal Bhasha () in &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt; due to its association with &lt;a href=\"Bangal\"&gt;Bangals&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeographical distribution.\n&lt;a href=\"Suniti%20Kumar%20Chatterji\"&gt;Suniti Kumar Chatterji&lt;/a&gt;, describing the cluster as \"Va\u1e45ga Dialects\", further divided it into two groups of two: \"Western and Southwestern Va\u1e45ga\" and \"Eastern and Southeastern Va\u1e45ga\". Eastern Va\u1e45ga is spoken across the modern &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladeshi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Divisions%20of%20Bangladesh\"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sylhet%20Division\"&gt;Sylhet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Comilla\"&gt;Greater Comilla&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Chittagong%20Division\"&gt;Chittagong&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=\"Hills%20and%20Barak%20Valley%20Division\"&gt;Barak Valley Division&lt;/a&gt; of Assam and the state of Tripura in India. Southeastern Va\u1e45ga is spoken in the remaining area of the Chittagong division, corresponding to the former colonial territories of &lt;a href=\"Noakhali%20District\"&gt;Noakhali District&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chittagong%20District\"&gt;Chittagong District&lt;/a&gt;, and historically extended further into &lt;a href=\"Sittwe\"&gt;Sittwe&lt;/a&gt;. Western Va\u1e45ga is spoken across the Bangladeshi divisions of &lt;a href=\"Mymensingh%20Division\"&gt;Mymensingh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dhaka%20Division\"&gt;Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Barishal%20Division\"&gt;Barisal&lt;/a&gt;. Southwestern Va\u1e45ga is spoken across the &lt;a href=\"Khulna%20Division\"&gt;Khulna Division&lt;/a&gt;, where Eastern Bengali transitions into &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengali%20dialect\"&gt;Central Standard Bengali&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Muhammad%20Shahidullah\"&gt;Dr. Muhammad Shahidullah&lt;/a&gt; divided all Bengali dialects into two groups: Pr\u0101cya () and P\u0101\u015bc\u0101tya (). Within his Pr\u0101cya grouping, he created the divisions of \"Southeastern\" and \"Extreme Eastern\", which approximately correspond to Chatterji's \"Western and Southwestern Va\u1e45ga\" and \"Eastern and Southeastern Va\u1e45ga\", respectively. The Southeastern group is spoken across the modern Bangladeshi divisions of Mymensingh, Dhaka, Barisal, and Khulna, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Noakhali\"&gt;Greater Noakhali&lt;/a&gt; region of the Chittagong division and eastern parts of the &lt;a href=\"24%20Parganas\"&gt;24 Parganas&lt;/a&gt; district in West Bengal. The Extreme Eastern group is spoken across the Bangladeshi divisions Sylhet and Chittagong, including Greater Comilla and excluding Greater Noakhali, as well as the Barak Valley division of Assam.\nPhonology.\nEastern Bengali is characterised by a considerably smaller phoneme inventory when compared with &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Bengali\"&gt;Standard Bengali&lt;/a&gt;.\nTone.\nThe aspiration and &lt;a href=\"breathy%20voice\"&gt;breathy voice&lt;/a&gt; present in Standard Bengali is notably mostly if not entirely absent in Eastern Bengali. The &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengali&lt;/a&gt; linguists Chatterji and &lt;a href=\"Sukumar%20Sen%20%28linguist%29\"&gt;Sen&lt;/a&gt; described the deaspirated voiced consonants present in Eastern Bengali as being &lt;a href=\"Implosive%20consonant\"&gt;implosive consonants&lt;/a&gt;, such that the Standard Bengali phonemes [b\u02b1], [d\u032a\u02b1], [\u0256\u02b1], [d\u0292\u02b1], and [\u0261\u02b1] would respectively correspond to [], [], [], [&lt;a href=\"Implosive%20consonant\"&gt;\u0257\u0292&lt;/a&gt;], and [] in Eastern Bengali. However, Animesh K. Pal, a native speaker of Eastern Bengali from &lt;a href=\"Narayanganj%20District\"&gt;Narayanganj&lt;/a&gt;, disputed this claim, instead describing the deaspiration as leading to the development of &lt;a href=\"Tone%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;tones&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese tones are not limited to voiced aspirates, but are also present as compensation for the aspiration of consonants that were voiceless aspirates in Standard Bengali. Tone continues to exist in words even if they are not part of a near-identical pair that requires it for the sake of contrast.\nFurthermore, the [\u0266] of Standard Bengali is most often deleted in Eastern Bengali dialects. This &lt;a href=\"h-dropping\"&gt;h-dropping&lt;/a&gt; has also been said to result in tone."
