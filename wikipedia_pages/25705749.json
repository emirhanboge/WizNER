    "text": "The Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame, located at the &lt;a href=\"Canada%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Museum\"&gt;Canada Science and Technology Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Ottawa, Ontario, honours Canadians who have made outstanding contributions to society in science and engineering. It also promotes role models to encourage young Canadians to pursue careers in science, engineering and technology. The hall includes a permanent exhibition, a traveling exhibition, a virtual gallery, and events and programming to celebrate inductees.\nHistory.\nThe Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame was established in 1991 through a joint partnership by the Canada Science and Technology Museum, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Research%20Council%20of%20Canada\"&gt;National Research Council of Canada&lt;/a&gt; (NRC), &lt;a href=\"Industry%20Canada\"&gt;Industry Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the Association of Partners in Education, to mark the NRC's 75th anniversary. The hall has since become a major feature of the Canada Science and Technology Museum, and has become a part of the museum's permanent Innovation Canada exhibition.\nInduction Process.\nThe museum uses an open process for nomination of new members. A selection committee reviews nominations annually. Nominees must meet the following criteria:\nIn April 2015, two members of the selection committee, &lt;a href=\"Judy%20Illes\"&gt;Judy Illes&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20Anderson%20%28scientist%29\"&gt;Catherine Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, resigned over concerns that, for the second year in a row, there were no female candidates in the list of finalists.\nMembers.\nThe following people have been inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame (listed by date of birth):"
