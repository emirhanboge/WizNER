    "text": "Kvemo Barghebi (; ) is a village in &lt;a href=\"Gali%20Municipality\"&gt;Gali Municipality&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28country%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. As is the case in the rest of the district its population is almost exclusively &lt;a href=\"Georgians\"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn March 1995, the Abkhaz militias from the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Ochamchira%20district\"&gt;Ochamchira district&lt;/a&gt; raided Kvemo Barghebi, beat prisoners with rods, burned them with hot knives and bayonets, stabbed them and set their bodies on fire. The Abkhaz militia killed 28 persons, most of whom were tortured to death. In the following years, the &lt;a href=\"Amnesty%20International\"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; and Georgia's &lt;a href=\"Ombudsman\"&gt;Ombudsman&lt;/a&gt;'s office accused the Abkhaz militia of several arbitrary detentions of ethnic Georgian villagers and other human rights abuses.\nIn 2007, the head of the village, ethnic Georgian Fridon Chakaberia was arrested by Georgian authorities when he came to &lt;a href=\"Zugdidi\"&gt;Zugdidi&lt;/a&gt;, charged with trafficking of drugs and sentenced to 10 years of prison. According to the Georgian opposition TV channel &lt;a href=\"Imedi\"&gt;Imedi&lt;/a&gt; Chakaberia was convicted only because he was the official of Abkhazian government. Abkhazian officials also denied that he was guilty of any crimes and maintained that he was a &lt;a href=\"political%20prisoner\"&gt;political prisoner&lt;/a&gt;. Higher Georgian court later changed his sentence to 5 years &lt;a href=\"probation\"&gt;probation&lt;/a&gt; and Chakaberia was able to return to Abkhazia and assume his duties."
