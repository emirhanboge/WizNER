    "text": "The Allamoore Formation is a &lt;a href=\"Precambrian\"&gt;Precambrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Formation%20%28geology%29\"&gt;geologic formation&lt;/a&gt; found in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Van%20Horn%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Van Horn, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The formation is notable for the well-preserved &lt;a href=\"Microfossil\"&gt;microfossils&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"chert\"&gt;chert&lt;/a&gt; beds within the formation. These may include early &lt;a href=\"eukaryotes\"&gt;eukaryotes&lt;/a&gt;. Possible &lt;a href=\"fossil%20burrow\"&gt;fossil burrow&lt;/a&gt;s were reported in the formation in 1995, which would push the origin of the first animals (&lt;a href=\"Metazoa\"&gt;Metazoa&lt;/a&gt;) back to before 1000 million years ago. However, these have since been explained as &lt;a href=\"diagenetic\"&gt;diagenetic&lt;/a&gt; structures, formed by nonbiological processes as the &lt;a href=\"sediments\"&gt;sediments&lt;/a&gt; making up the formation were &lt;a href=\"Compaction%20%28geology%29\"&gt;compacted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lithification\"&gt;lithified&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe Allamoore Formation consists of blue to brown thinly &lt;a href=\"Bedding%20%28geology%29\"&gt;bedded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; with interbedded &lt;a href=\"chert\"&gt;chert&lt;/a&gt; seams. Masses of &lt;a href=\"metavolcanic%20rock\"&gt;metavolcanic rock&lt;/a&gt; are also found within the formation, including metamorphosed &lt;a href=\"basalts\"&gt;basalts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tuffs\"&gt;tuffs&lt;/a&gt; that were once &lt;a href=\"lava%20flows\"&gt;lava flows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"volcanic%20ash\"&gt;volcanic ash&lt;/a&gt; beds. The formation is exposed only in a &lt;a href=\"Fold%20and%20thrust%20belt\"&gt;folded belt&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Van%20Horn%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Van Horn, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"tectonic\"&gt;tectonic&lt;/a&gt; process tilted the beds nearly vertical. This exposed a thickness of over of limestone beds. The formation overlies the &lt;a href=\"Carrizo%20Formation\"&gt;Carrizo Formation&lt;/a&gt; and is in turn overlain by the &lt;a href=\"Tumbledown%20Formation\"&gt;Tumbledown Formation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe age of the Allamoore Formation is estimated at 1250 million years, based on &lt;a href=\"radiometric%20dating\"&gt;radiometric dating&lt;/a&gt; of ash beds within the formation. The formation is thought to have been deposited during the &lt;a href=\"Grenville%20Orogeny\"&gt;Grenville Orogeny&lt;/a&gt;, when another continent (likely Africa) collided with North America. This led to the opening of &lt;a href=\"rift\"&gt;rift&lt;/a&gt; basins along the southern margin of North America, where sediments accumulated. The sediments making up the Allamoore Formation largely escaped the severe &lt;a href=\"metamorphism\"&gt;metamorphism&lt;/a&gt; that affected most of the sedimentary rock laid down during the orogeny. This makes the formation a valuable window into conditions at that time.\nFossils.\nThe chert beds of the Allamoore Formation contain exceptionally well-preserved microfossils. These were part of mat-building communities of microbes (&lt;a href=\"stromatolites\"&gt;stromatolites&lt;/a&gt;) that lived in shallow water and were occasionally exposed to air. The microorganisms were preserved in fine-grained chert shortly after their remains were buried in sediments. They appear to be mostly &lt;a href=\"cyanobacteria\"&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/a&gt;, members of the families &lt;a href=\"Entophysalidaceae\"&gt;Entophysalidaceae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chroococcaceae\"&gt;Chroococcaceae&lt;/a&gt;. The chert also preserves tubular remains of organisms resembling the modern \"&lt;a href=\"Oscillatoria\"&gt;Oscillatoria&lt;/a&gt;\" and other filamentary &lt;a href=\"prokaryotes\"&gt;prokaryotes&lt;/a&gt;. The chert contains well-preserved large spheroidal cells exceeding 100 microns in diameter, which may be early examples of &lt;a href=\"Red%20algae\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Green%20algae\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"eukaryotic\"&gt;eukaryotic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"algae\"&gt;algae&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1995, a team of researchers reported the presence of sediment-filled tubes in the formation. These were interpreted as &lt;a href=\"fossil%20burrow\"&gt;fossil burrow&lt;/a&gt;s of very early &lt;a href=\"Metazoa\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt;. If confirmed, the finding would push the origin of animal life back to before 1000 million years ago. However, the structures have since been interpreted as \"pseudo-traces\", &lt;a href=\"sedimentary%20structures\"&gt;sedimentary structures&lt;/a&gt; formed in the sediments by inorganic processes as the sediments were converted to solid rock (&lt;a href=\"diagenesis\"&gt;diagenesis&lt;/a&gt;).\nHistory of investigation.\nThe beds assigned to the formation were originally part of the (now-defunct) Millican Formation. They were assigned to the Allamoore Formation in 1940 by Philip B. King and named for exposures near the Allamoore Post Office."
