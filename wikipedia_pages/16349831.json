He played for the Panthers' &lt;a href=\"NSW%20Cup\"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt; reserve-grade team in 2006.\nClub career.\nPenrith Panthers.\nIn Round 1 of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20NRL%20season\"&gt;2007 NRL season&lt;/a&gt; he made his &lt;a href=\"NRL\"&gt;NRL&lt;/a&gt; debut for the Panthers against the &lt;a href=\"Cronulla-Sutherland%20Sharks\"&gt;Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a 2009 pre-season trial, Moors suffered a broken ankle which stopped him from playing first-grade that season.\nWests Tigers.\nIn September 2009, Moors signed a one-year contract with the &lt;a href=\"Wests%20Tigers\"&gt;Wests Tigers&lt;/a&gt; starting in 2010, with the Tigers having an option to extend his contract for a further season.\nMoors became a regular interchange player in the second half of 2012, making 14 appearances for the year. He said, \"It\u2019s something I have struggled with over the last couple of years, keeping my weight down but it\u2019s been good this year. I\u2019m starting to feel more comfortable in the team now.\" Statistically, Moors was revealed to be one of the most effective tacklers in the &lt;a href=\"NRL\"&gt;NRL&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, with a 94.1% success rate in tackles. He was also a member of the &lt;a href=\"Balmain%20Ryde%20Eastwood%20Tigers\"&gt;Balmain Ryde Eastwood Tigers&lt;/a&gt; side that lost the &lt;a href=\"NSW%20Cup\"&gt;NSW Cup&lt;/a&gt; grand final.\nMelbourne Storm.\nOn 13 September 2012, Moors signed a one-year contract with &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20Storm\"&gt;Melbourne Storm&lt;/a&gt; starting in 2013.\nHis first game was interchange for Storm's &lt;a href=\"2013%20World%20Club%20Challenge\"&gt;2013 World Club Challenge&lt;/a&gt; win over &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;.\nCastleford Tigers.\nOn 11 June 2014, it was confirmed that Moors had signed a three-year contract to play for the &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt; club the &lt;a href=\"Castleford%20Tigers\"&gt;Castleford Tigers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Castleford%20Tigers%20players\"&gt;Heritage \u2116 953&lt;/a&gt;) from 2015. Castleford head coach &lt;a href=\"Daryl%20Powell\"&gt;Daryl Powell&lt;/a&gt; said of the signing: \"I think his style is going to be really well-suited to the Super League and he'll be a real threat.\"\nMoors was given squad number 16 ahead of his first season with the Tigers. Moors made his Super League d\u00e9but against the &lt;a href=\"Wakefield%20Trinity%20Wildcats\"&gt;Wakefield Trinity Wildcats&lt;/a&gt; in the first round, on 8 February 2015. He scored his first try for the club against the &lt;a href=\"Warrington%20Wolves\"&gt;Warrington Wolves&lt;/a&gt; in round 23, on 26 July. He finished the year having made 25 appearances and scored 4 tries.\nFor 2016, Moors was assigned shirt number 17. He suffered a &lt;a href=\"broken%20hand\"&gt;broken hand&lt;/a&gt; in March, missing 8 games, although returned earlier than expected - Daryl Powell described his post-injury form as \"outstanding\", and called him \"a tough character\". His \"irrepressible\" performance in Castleford's 52-12 victory over West Yorkshire rivals &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds Rhinos&lt;/a&gt; saw him voted as the Fans' Man of the Match. His outstanding personal year saw him dominate the club's end-of-season awards, being recognised as the Fans' Player of the Year, Players' Player of the Year, and 1st Place Player of the Year. In October, he signed a two-year contract extension with the Tigers until the end of 2019. \"He had an enormous 2016, being one of the best forwards in Super League,\" said Daryl Powell.\nMoors was utilised as an impact player for the 2017 season, making the vast majority of his appearances as an interchange. In June, he sustained a knee ligament injury which kept him out for 8 games. He continued his impressive performances, and greatly contributed towards the Tigers 1st-placed finish in Super League. Resultantly, in August he signed a further one-year contract extension, keeping him at Castleford until the end of 2020. Daryl Powell said, \"Junior Moors is a high-quality player who has continued to get better during his time at the club.\" He played in the &lt;a href=\"2017%20Super%20League%20Grand%20Final\"&gt;2017 Super League Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; defeat by the &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds Rhinos&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the retirement of &lt;a href=\"Andy%20Lynch%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Andy Lynch&lt;/a&gt;, Moors was given squad number 8 for 2018. This, however, didn't reflect any change in his role on the pitch, as he remained a key impact substitute. He largely avoided any long-term injuries and made 25 appearances this year. He also scored 8 tries, including his first brace against the &lt;a href=\"Huddersfield%20Giants\"&gt;Huddersfield Giants&lt;/a&gt; on 13 September - this made the 2018 season his highest-scoring campaign yet.\nMoors' 2019 season was severely limited by serious injuries - he sustained a knee injury in April, keeping him out for 2 months, before suffering a season-ending hip fracture in just his second game back. He made 13 appearances and scored 3 tries.\nIn November 2020, Castleford coach &lt;a href=\"Daryl%20Powell\"&gt;Daryl Powell&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the departure of Moors\nFeatherstone Rovers.\nOn 20 January 2021 it was reported that he had signed for &lt;a href=\"Featherstone%20Rovers\"&gt;Featherstone&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"RFL%20Championship\"&gt;RFL Championship&lt;/a&gt;\nInternational career.\nWhile attending &lt;a href=\"Patrician%20Brothers%27%20College%20Blacktown\"&gt;Patrician Brothers' College Blacktown&lt;/a&gt;, Moors played for the &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20schoolboys%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Australian Schoolboys team&lt;/a&gt; in 2004.\nIn 2013, Junior was selected for the &lt;a href=\"Samoa%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Samoa national rugby league team&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2013 Rugby League World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. He played in 3 of the Samoans 4 tournament games, scoring one try against the &lt;a href=\"France%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; in the group stage."
