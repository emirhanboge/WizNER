    "text": "MWC 349 is a &lt;a href=\"binary%20star\"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt; (likely, &lt;a href=\"triple%20star\"&gt;triple&lt;/a&gt;) star system in the constellation &lt;a href=\"Cygnus%20%28constellation%29\"&gt;Cygnus&lt;/a&gt;. Its properties are still debated and it may be a massive highly luminous star or a very young less luminous &lt;a href=\"Herbig%20Ae/Be%20star\"&gt;Herbig Ae/Be star&lt;/a&gt;. MWC 349 is also a &lt;a href=\"variable%20star\"&gt;variable star&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"variable%20star%20designation\"&gt;designation&lt;/a&gt; V1478 Cygni.\nMWC 349A and B and a third star.\nMWC 349 is a resolved double star, with its components separated by 2.4 &lt;a href=\"arc%20second\"&gt;arc second&lt;/a&gt;s. The primary, MWC 349A, is a &lt;a href=\"B%28e%29%20star\"&gt;B[e] star&lt;/a&gt;, where the \"B\" is the spectral type and the \"[e]\" denotes &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20mechanism\"&gt;forbidden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"emission%20line\"&gt;emission line&lt;/a&gt;s. Its spectrum lacks absorption features and is variable but has been classified as B0-1.5 with a &lt;a href=\"supergiant\"&gt;supergiant&lt;/a&gt; luminosity class. The secondary, MWC 349B, is a &lt;a href=\"giant%20star\"&gt;giant star&lt;/a&gt; with a spectral type of B0III.\nIt has been proposed that there is a third star, of lower mass and closely orbiting MWC 349A, possibly at a distance of 12\u201313 &lt;a href=\"Astronomical%20Unit\"&gt;AU&lt;/a&gt; from the primary with a period of 9 years. Such a star has not been observed but would help to explain some unusual properties of the system.\nFeatures.\nMWC 349B appears to be a relatively conventional hot giant star, but it is nonetheless very unusual. It is a supergiant B[e] star, indicating that it is a luminous star with high mass loss and a disc of surrounding material. These features are shared by &lt;a href=\"pre-main-sequence%20star\"&gt;pre-main-sequence star&lt;/a&gt;s and evolved very massive stars, and it is unclear which category MWC 349A falls into.\nMWC 349 is one of the brightest radio sources in the sky and 2\u00a0cm observations show a prominent &lt;a href=\"bipolar%20nebula\"&gt;hourglass nebula&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a very faint &lt;a href=\"infrared\"&gt;infrared&lt;/a&gt; nebula with the same orientation and geometry, but 400 times larger (5 parsecs across). It is extremely unusual in showing hydrogen recombination masers and lasers, interpreted as originating in the disc.\nOne theory is that MWC 349A is a highly luminous evolved star similar to a &lt;a href=\"luminous%20blue%20variable\"&gt;luminous blue variable&lt;/a&gt; (LBV), with an &lt;a href=\"absolute%20magnitude\"&gt;absolute magnitude&lt;/a&gt; somewhere between \u22126.7 and \u22127.3, and a &lt;a href=\"bolometric%20luminosity\"&gt;bolometric luminosity&lt;/a&gt; several hundred thousand times that of the sun. It is a variable star and the &lt;a href=\"General%20Catalogue%20of%20Variable%20Stars\"&gt;General Catalogue of Variable Stars&lt;/a&gt; lists it as an &lt;a href=\"S%20Doradus\"&gt;S Doradus&lt;/a&gt; variable due to its erratic brightness and spectral changes. The distant association with MWC 349B and its remoteness from the dense star-forming regions that would normally host such luminous stars is unusual. One possibility is that the whole system was ejected from &lt;a href=\"Cygnus%20OB2\"&gt;Cygnus OB2&lt;/a&gt; and the two components have since become unbound due to mass loss from MWC 349A.\nThe alternative theory is that MWC 349A is still condensing onto the &lt;a href=\"main%20sequence\"&gt;main sequence&lt;/a&gt;. It is still a massive star surrounded by a disc of material but that material was not ejected from the star, and the luminosity is lower than would be the case for a more massive evolved star. The compact nature of the material absorbing and re-radiating much of the stars output suggests that it is unlikely to be extremely luminous.\nOrigin.\nMWC 349 may be a &lt;a href=\"runaway%20star\"&gt;runaway star&lt;/a&gt; ejected from the nearby, massive &lt;a href=\"Cygnus%20OB2\"&gt;Cygnus OB2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"stellar%20association\"&gt;association&lt;/a&gt;. The mass of the main component of the system, MWC 349A, is assumed to have been when the star was born 40 times the mass of the Sun, but &lt;a href=\"stellar%20evolution\"&gt;stellar evolution&lt;/a&gt; left it with just 20-25 &lt;a href=\"solar%20mass\"&gt;solar mass&lt;/a&gt;es, destabilizing the system and causing MWC 349B to no longer be gravitationally bound."
