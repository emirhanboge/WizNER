Spooner was also one of the early opponents of direct &lt;a href=\"primary%20election\"&gt;primary election&lt;/a&gt;s. At the time, &lt;a href=\"Political%20party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; nominees were selected by the party officials, sometimes by &lt;a href=\"Political%20boss\"&gt;party bosses&lt;/a&gt;. Spooner's view of political campaigns if direct primaries became standard was:\nDirect primaries would destroy the party machinery ... and would build up a lot of personal machines, and would make every man a self-seeker, and would degrade politics by turning candidacies into bitter personal wrangles.\nLater life.\nAfter his retirement from the Senate, he practiced law in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. In 1910, Spooner and &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20P.%20Cotton\"&gt;Joseph P.
