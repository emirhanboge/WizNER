    "text": "The M\u00fcller House is a historic house located at 500 North Vail Avenue in &lt;a href=\"Arlington%20Heights%2C%20Illinois\"&gt;Arlington Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illinois\"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. F.W. M\u00fcller built the house for his family and their &lt;a href=\"soda%20water\"&gt;soda water&lt;/a&gt; business in 1882. The M\u00fcller business was one of the first commercial establishments in Arlington Heights and was part of the city's early transition from a rural settlement to a large suburb of &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. The house is also an uncommon blend of architectural styles; while it features a &lt;a href=\"Greek%20Revival%20architecture\"&gt;Greek Revival&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cornice\"&gt;cornice&lt;/a&gt; with scrolled &lt;a href=\"bracket%20%28architecture%29\"&gt;bracket&lt;/a&gt;s and a symmetrical front facade, the style is not seen elsewhere in the house, which otherwise has a &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20architecture\"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; design. The design also combines the functional necessities of the factory with the decorative features of a middle-class home; prominent among the latter is the house's woodwork, which includes a carved &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; staircase.\nThe house was added to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places\"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; on March 26, 1979. It is now part of the Arlington Heights Historical Museum."
