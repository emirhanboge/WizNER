    "text": "The 2007\u201308 season was the 128th season of competitive &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nRangers played a total of 68 competitive matches during the 2007\u201308 season. It was &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Smith\"&gt;Walter Smith&lt;/a&gt;'s first full season at the club since 1997\u201398. The early season priority was qualification for the group stages of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt; and this was secured with hard-fought victories over &lt;a href=\"FK%20Zeta\"&gt;FK Zeta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Star%20Belgrade\"&gt;Red Star Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;.\nRangers were drawn in Group E with &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Olympique%20Lyonnais\"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"VfB%20Stuttgart\"&gt;Stuttgart&lt;/a&gt;. The group stage started well, with the first two matches resulting in victories, over Stuttgart and Lyon. A home draw with Barcelona left Rangers with seven points after three games, but the last three matches all resulted in defeat, meaning Rangers finished third in the group and entered the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. However, the European adventure continued for Rangers as they progressed to the semi-finals of the competition by beating &lt;a href=\"Panathinaikos%20F.C.\"&gt;Panathinaikos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Werder%20Bremen\"&gt;Werder Bremen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal\"&gt;Sporting Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;. They then reached &lt;a href=\"2008%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;the final&lt;/a&gt; with a penalty shootout victory against &lt;a href=\"ACF%20Fiorentina\"&gt;Fiorentina&lt;/a&gt;. They played &lt;a href=\"FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Zenit Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, managed by formed Gers boss &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Advocaat\"&gt;Dick Advocaat&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; on 14 May. Rangers lost the match 2\u20130, with over 200,000 fans in the city to see the game. When asked if the SFA should have extended the season to benefit Rangers, Ally McCoist said: \"They were a disgrace. It was embarrassing. I think the Russian federation cancelled Zenit's three or four games previously. I think we played something like eight games in eighteen days. It might just sound like &lt;a href=\"sour%20grapes\"&gt;sour grapes&lt;/a&gt;, but no: any other country in the planet, the association would have helped the team. If you're asking me if it was wrong, it was completely and utterly wrong.\"\nOn the domestic front, the race for the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Scottish Premier League&lt;/a&gt; continued until the final matchday of the season. Both &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; were tied on 86 points going into their games (against &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%20F.C.\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt; respectively) on 22 May 2008, but Celtic were top of the table due to having a better goal difference of 57, six ahead of Rangers. This did not prove to be decisive, as Rangers surrendered their hopes of landing the championship with a 2\u20130 defeat away to \"the Dons\", while Celtic beat &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee United&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20130. The club had had a ten-point lead in late March, although their nearest rivals, Celtic, had games in hand at the time. However having to play four competitive matches (including a UEFA Cup Final) in the last eight days of the season proved just too much of a problem for Rangers to overcome.\nThe club appeared in its first final since 2005. They played &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee United&lt;/a&gt; on 16 March 2008 and won the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20League%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; on penalties. The match was tied 2-2 after extra time, with both goals coming from &lt;a href=\"Kris%20Boyd\"&gt;Kris Boyd&lt;/a&gt; who also scored the winning spot kick.\nThey also reached the final of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the 49th time. They beat &lt;a href=\"St%20Johnstone%20F.C.\"&gt;St Johnstone&lt;/a&gt; 4\u20133 on penalties in the semi-final after the score was tied at 1-1 after extra time. The club played &lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20the%20South%20F.C.\"&gt;Queen of the South&lt;/a&gt; in the final on 24 May 2008 and won the match 3-2 thanks to goals from &lt;a href=\"DaMarcus%20Beasley\"&gt;DaMarcus Beasley&lt;/a&gt; and a double from &lt;a href=\"Kris%20Boyd\"&gt;Kris Boyd&lt;/a&gt;."
