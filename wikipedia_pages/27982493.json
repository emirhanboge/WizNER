He was caught, and interned at Khowai jail where he was subjected to torture. A death sentenced was issued against him by the Tripura government, but never executed.\nDebbarma became an organiser of the Janashiksha Samity, and mobilised protest activities against the government of Tripura.

He would remain a CPI(M) Tripura State Committee member until his death. Moreover, he served as the vice president of the Ganamukti Parishad (the tribal mass organisation of CPI(M) in Tripura).\nDebbarma again faced arrests in 1965 (during the &lt;a href=\"Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201965\"&gt;Indo-Pakistani War&lt;/a&gt;), 1968, 1973 (during the food movement) and 1975 (during the &lt;a href=\"Emergency%20%28India%29\"&gt;Emergency&lt;/a&gt;, when he was imprisoned for 21 months).\nDebbarma was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Tripura\"&gt;Tripura&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vidhan%20Sabha\"&gt;state legislative assembly&lt;/a&gt; between 1967 and 1993, being elected six consecutive times. When the CPI(M)-&lt;a href=\"Congress%20for%20Democracy\"&gt;Congress for Democracy&lt;/a&gt; coalition government was formed in 1977, Debbarma was named Minister in charge of tribal welfare. During his later years, he retired from active politics due to ill health."
