In the newly formed Kerala state, Adoor was in &lt;a href=\"Kollam%20district\"&gt;Kollam district&lt;/a&gt;. In 1982, due to the demands, a new district named &lt;a href=\"Pathanamthitta%20district\"&gt;Pathanamthitta&lt;/a&gt; was formed and &lt;a href=\"Adoor\"&gt;Adoor&lt;/a&gt; was separated from Kollam district and incorporated to the newly forming &lt;a href=\"Pathanamthitta%20district\"&gt;Pathanamthitta district&lt;/a&gt;.
