    "text": "Francis Barlow (c. 1626 \u2013 1704) was an English painter, etcher, and illustrator.\nHe ranks among the most prolific book-illustrators and &lt;a href=\"Printmaking\"&gt;printmaker&lt;/a&gt;s of the 17th century, working across several &lt;a href=\"genre\"&gt;genre&lt;/a&gt;s: natural history, hunting and recreation, politics, and decoration and design.\nBarlow is known as \"the father of British sporting painting\"; he was Britain's first &lt;a href=\"Animal%20painter\"&gt;wildlife painter&lt;/a&gt;, beginning a tradition that reached a high-point a century later, in the work of &lt;a href=\"George%20Stubbs\"&gt;George Stubbs&lt;/a&gt;. He was furthermore a pioneer in the &lt;a href=\"history%20of%20comics\"&gt;history of comics&lt;/a&gt; by creating \"&lt;a href=\"A%20True%20Narrative%20of%20the%20Horrid%20Hellish%20Popish%20Plot\"&gt;A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish Plot&lt;/a&gt;\" (c. 1682), a picture story about the life of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Oates\"&gt;Titus Oates&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Popish%20Plot\"&gt;Popish Plot&lt;/a&gt;, which is told in a series of illustrated sequences where the story is written underneath them and the characters depicted on those images use &lt;a href=\"speech%20balloon\"&gt;speech balloon&lt;/a&gt;s to talk. While it is not the first example of its kind in history, it is one of the oldest which is signed.\nLife.\nBarlow was born c. 1626 in &lt;a href=\"Lincolnshire\"&gt;Lincolnshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe exact day of Barlow's death is unknown but he was buried on 11 August 1704. &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Strutt%20%28engraver%20and%20antiquary%29\"&gt;Joseph Strutt&lt;/a&gt; records that Barlow died in poverty: \"not withstanding all his excellency in design, the multitude of pictures and drawings he appears to have made, and the assistance also of a considerable sum of money, said to have been left to him by a friend, he died in indigent circumstances.\"\nWork.\nBarlow's first major work was the illustration (via twelve plates) of poet &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Benlowe\"&gt;Edward Benlowe&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Theophila\" (1652). In Barlow's favour, &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Henry%20Bullen\"&gt;Bullen&lt;/a&gt; said in 1885 that \"the volume [was] valued rather for the engravings than for the text.\" According to &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Chetham%27s%20Library\"&gt;Chetham's Library&lt;/a&gt;, no two copies of Benlowe's \"Theophila\" are the same, and no copy survives in good condition. The &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum\"&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum&lt;/a&gt; holds two different copies, one of which includes an original drawing by Barlow.\nBarlow designed the one hundred and ten &lt;a href=\"woodcut\"&gt;woodcut&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"John%20Ogilby\"&gt;John Ogilby&lt;/a&gt;'s translation of \"&lt;a href=\"Aesop%27s%20Fables\"&gt;Aesop's Fables&lt;/a&gt;\", published in 1665, several of the plates of which Barlow etched himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Hugh%20James%20Rose\"&gt;Hugh James Rose&lt;/a&gt; observed in the early 19th century that Barlow's \"chief merit [. . .] as a designer, lay in his exactness in the portrayal of birds, fishes, and animals of all kinds, which are executed in a spirited, and in many instances a masterly manner.\" One example of this gift is in a set of twelve prints by &lt;a href=\"Wenceslaus%20Hollar\"&gt;Wenceslaus Hollar&lt;/a&gt; of engravings after drawings by Barlow, entitled \"Several Ways of Hunting, Hawking, and Fishing, invented by Francis Barlow, engraved by W. Hollar, 1671\", published by John Overton.\nA 2011 article in \"&lt;a href=\"History%20Today\"&gt;History Today&lt;/a&gt;\" explored the &lt;a href=\"subtext\"&gt;subtext&lt;/a&gt; in examples of Barlow's work: though his wildlife paintings are superb works of art in themselves, they are, at the same time, \"full of rich metaphors that shed light on the anxieties and concerns of a Britain emerging from the horrors of &lt;a href=\"English%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;\". A case in point is \"A Decoy\", Barlow's &lt;a href=\"allegory\"&gt;allegory&lt;/a&gt; on the threat posed to England by &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;Roman Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the years leading up to the &lt;a href=\"Glorious%20Revolution\"&gt;Glorious Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, Barlow became the prime designer of &lt;a href=\"political%20satire\"&gt;political satire&lt;/a&gt; in support of the &lt;a href=\"Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29\"&gt;Whigs&lt;/a&gt;; Whig &lt;a href=\"Member%20of%20parliament\"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Denzil%20Onslow%20of%20Pyrford\"&gt;Denzil Onslow&lt;/a&gt; (1642-1721) acquired or commissioned a number of paintings by Barlow, to decorate his &lt;a href=\"manor%20house\"&gt;manor house&lt;/a&gt;, Pyrford Court. These were more recently housed at &lt;a href=\"Clandon%20Park\"&gt;Clandon Park&lt;/a&gt;, an 18th-century mansion near &lt;a href=\"Guildford\"&gt;Guildford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Surrey\"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt;, becoming one of the largest collections of Barlow's surviving work. Barlow's (and others') work \"miraculously\" survived a devastating fire at Clandon Park on 29 April 2015.\nExamples of Barlow's work can be seen at &lt;a href=\"Ham%20House\"&gt;Ham House&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Ham%2C%20London\"&gt;Ham&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"Richmond%2C%20London\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt; in London); examples are held, too, by: &lt;a href=\"Tate%20Britain\"&gt;Tate Britain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London\"&gt;National Portrait Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"British%20Museum\"&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum\"&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum&lt;/a&gt;.\nBarlow frequently signed the initials of his name, \"F.B.\", instead of inserting it at full length, sometimes enclosing the initials in a small circle.\nAssessment.\nBarlow has come to be regarded as a \"surprisingly neglected artist\". Art historian &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Hallett%20%28art%20historian%29\"&gt;Mark Hallett&lt;/a&gt; accounts for this by noting that Barlow's time is British art's \"forgotten era\" - one that \"has tended to be overshadowed by the achievements of earlier artists, such as &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20van%20Dyck\"&gt;Van Dyck&lt;/a&gt;, or those that came later, such as &lt;a href=\"William%20Hogarth\"&gt;Hogarth&lt;/a&gt;\"; Hallett finds this unjust: Barlow made a significant contribution to what \"in reality [. . .] was a remarkably rich, vibrant and cosmopolitan period for the visual arts in Britain.\""
