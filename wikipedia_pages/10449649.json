    "text": "Malati J. Shendge (1934\u20132015) was an &lt;a href=\"Indologist\"&gt;Indologist&lt;/a&gt;. She received her Ph.D in Buddhism from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Delhi\"&gt;University of Delhi&lt;/a&gt;. She had been a fellow of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Council%20of%20Historical%20Research\"&gt;Indian Council of Historical Research&lt;/a&gt;, and of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Institute%20of%20Advanced%20Study\"&gt;Indian Institute of Advanced Study&lt;/a&gt;, Shimla. She was a faculty member at &lt;a href=\"Jawaharlal%20Nehru%20University%2C%20Delhi\"&gt;Jawaharlal Nehru University&lt;/a&gt;, and Founder Director (Hon.) of the Rang Datta Wadekar Centre for the study of Indian Tradition, Pune.\nTheories.\nShendge has written a number of books on the connections between the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20Valley%20Civilization\"&gt;Indus Valley Civilization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vedic%20culture\"&gt;Vedic culture&lt;/a&gt;. Her early work, \"The Civilized Demons\", reinterprets the heavenly battle between the &lt;a href=\"Asura\"&gt;Asura&lt;/a&gt;s and the Devas described in the &lt;a href=\"Rigveda\"&gt;Rigveda&lt;/a&gt; as a historical record of an earthly war in the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20Valley\"&gt;Indus Valley&lt;/a&gt; between the Asuras (identified by her as being the &lt;a href=\"Assyrian%20people\"&gt;Assyrian people&lt;/a&gt;) already living in the valley as the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20Valley%20Civilisation\"&gt;Harappan Civilization&lt;/a&gt;, and the invading Devas (identified by her with the &lt;a href=\"Aryan\"&gt;Aryan&lt;/a&gt;s). Her 1997 book \"The Language of the Harappans\" extends this theory by claiming that the unknown &lt;a href=\"Harappan%20language\"&gt;Harappan language&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Akkadian%20language\"&gt;Akkadian language&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mesopotamia\"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; is a descendant of Akkadian. In \"Unsealing the Indus Script\" (2009) she purports to decode the &lt;a href=\"Indus%20script\"&gt;Indus script&lt;/a&gt; based on this theory."
