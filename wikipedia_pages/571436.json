    "text": "Land O'Lakes, Inc. is an American member-owned &lt;a href=\"agricultural%20cooperative\"&gt;agricultural cooperative&lt;/a&gt; based in the &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis-St.%20Paul\"&gt;Minneapolis-St. Paul&lt;/a&gt; suburb of &lt;a href=\"Arden%20Hills%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Arden Hills, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, United States, focusing on the &lt;a href=\"dairy\"&gt;dairy&lt;/a&gt; industry. The &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt; has 1,959 direct producer-members, 751 member-cooperatives, and about 10,000 employees who process and distribute products for about 300,000 agricultural producers, handling 12\u00a0billion pounds of milk annually. It is ranked third on the &lt;a href=\"National%20Cooperative%20Bank\"&gt;National Cooperative Bank&lt;/a&gt; Co-op 100 list of mutuals and cooperatives. The co-op is one of the largest producers of &lt;a href=\"butter\"&gt;butter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt; in the United States through its dairy foods business; serves producers, animal owners and their families through more than 4,700 local cooperatives, independent dealers and other large retailers through its Purina Animal Nutrition (&lt;a href=\"Purina%20Mills\"&gt;Purina Mills&lt;/a&gt;) business; and delivers seed, crop protection products, agricultural services and agronomic insights to 1,300 locally owned and operated cooperative and independent agricultural retailers and their grower customers through its WinField United business.\nHistory.\nLand O'Lakes was founded on July 8, &lt;a href=\"1921\"&gt;1921&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Saint Paul, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, by representatives from 320 cooperative &lt;a href=\"creameries\"&gt;creameries&lt;/a&gt; as the Minnesota Cooperative Creameries Association. This organization aimed to improve marketing and quality of &lt;a href=\"butter\"&gt;butter&lt;/a&gt;, and thus increase the profitability of &lt;a href=\"dairying\"&gt;dairying&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Association developed and implemented the systematic inspection, grading and certification of butter from member creameries, resulting in greater uniformity of product. The improved quality and uniformity, and the reliability of its grading system, were touted in &lt;a href=\"advertising\"&gt;advertising&lt;/a&gt; materials. In &lt;a href=\"1924\"&gt;1924&lt;/a&gt;, the uniformly graded sweet cream butter was given the name \"Land O'Lakes\" after a contest, and the certificate forms used by the Association included the \"Land O Lakes\" marketing name (&lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;'s state nickname is \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\").\nThe name became so popular that the organization's public identity was often confused with its product name; thus, in 1926, the organization itself adopted the name \"Land O'Lakes Creameries, Inc.\" and became eponymous with its product.\nThe &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;co-op&lt;/a&gt; was often accused of unfair competition and false advertising in its early years, and compelled to defend its inspection and certification processes. Eventually, however, the sweet butter marketing strategy drove competitors either to match the quality of butter produced under the Land O'Lakes name or see their sales decline. Many competitors in the dairy products business copied the Land O'Lakes approach, and the certification of quality became a proven marketing technique in other product lines as well. In the 1960s and 1970s, Land O'Lakes and Lake to Lake (which later merged into Land O'Lakes) had a rivalry with the &lt;a href=\"National%20Farmers%20Organization\"&gt;National Farmers Organization&lt;/a&gt; over the practice of withholding milk from market. One member was expelled from Lake to Lake for recruiting other farmers into NFO.\nRecent history.\nThe Land O'Lakes &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;co-op&lt;/a&gt; has grown through numerous acquisitions, and now has a large business in farm supply in addition to dairy. In &lt;a href=\"2001\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, it paid $360 million \u2013 and assumed $130 million in debt \u2013 to take over animal feed producer &lt;a href=\"Purina%20Mills\"&gt;Purina Mills&lt;/a&gt;, once part of &lt;a href=\"Ralston%20Purina\"&gt;Ralston Purina&lt;/a&gt;. Purina Mills' new owner planned to merge the company with its Land O'Lakes Farmland Feed division but would keep the &lt;a href=\"Purina%20Mills\"&gt;Purina&lt;/a&gt; name and logo.\nIn 1978, Land O'Lakes got into the meatpacking business with the purchase of Spencer Beef. It sold Spencer Beef in 1983 to Excel, now &lt;a href=\"Cargill%20Meat%20Solutions\"&gt;Cargill Meat Solutions&lt;/a&gt;.\nA federal court in 2002 ordered Land O'Lakes to pay $3 million for &lt;a href=\"patent%20infringement\"&gt;patent infringement&lt;/a&gt; to Dr William Pordy, the inventor of a type of dairy creamer. An appeal court later overturned that ruling.\nLand O'Lakes took an ownership stake in egg producer MoArk in 1999; it took full ownership of the company in 2006.\nIn August 2012, Land O'Lakes purchased refrigerated desserts manufacturer &lt;a href=\"Kozy%20Shack\"&gt;Kozy Shack Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; for an undisclosed sum.\nIn June 2016, Land O'Lakes acquired the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Oaks%2C%20California\"&gt;Thousand Oaks, California&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"biofuel\"&gt;biofuel&lt;/a&gt;s firm &lt;a href=\"Ceres%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Ceres, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;\nIn July 2018, Land O'Lakes named Beth Ford as its first female CEO. Ford's role became effective August 1. At the time, she was the third openly gay woman CEO to run a Fortune 500 company.\nIn December 2019, Land O'Lakes used autonomous truck technology developed by Plus.ai to successfully complete the first cross-country, commercial freight run by a self-driving truck.\nCorporate affairs.\nThe company's headquarters is in &lt;a href=\"Arden%20Hills%2C%20Minnesota\"&gt;Arden Hills, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, in suburban &lt;a href=\"Minneapolis-St.%20Paul\"&gt;Minneapolis-St. Paul&lt;/a&gt;.\nButter packaging.\nThe Land O'Lakes indigenous woman, named Mia, holding the butter box was painted in 1928 by &lt;a href=\"Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Bigelow\"&gt;Brown &amp; Bigelow&lt;/a&gt; illustrator Arthur C. Hanson. According to Land O'Lakes, the original image of Mia was \"simplified and modernized\" in 1939 by Jess Betlach and has undergone many minor modifications since as the enduring &lt;a href=\"logo\"&gt;logo&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"cooperative\"&gt;co-op&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Red%20Lake%20Ojibwe\"&gt;Red Lake Ojibwe&lt;/a&gt; artist &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20DesJarlait\"&gt;Patrick DesJarlait&lt;/a&gt; updated Mia's image in the 1950s. Her clothes were changed to match specific Ojibwe styles, and the background became a specific location in the Ojibwe territory, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Lake%20%28Minnesota%29\"&gt;Red Lake in Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. The original image is an example of the &lt;a href=\"infinite-loop%20motif\"&gt;infinite-loop motif&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Droste%20effect\"&gt;Droste effect&lt;/a&gt;, in which the image is repeated, in theory infinitely, within itself.\nIn 2018, the image was changed to depict only the head of the Indian woman (doing away with the Droste effect). In April 2020, the company announced it was removing the image of the Indian woman altogether. The use of an indigenous woman as a mascot had been criticized as a &lt;a href=\"Stereotypes%20of%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20Canada%20and%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;racist stereotype&lt;/a&gt;, and the decision to change the label was praised by some Native advocates such as &lt;a href=\"Peggy%20Flanagan\"&gt;Peggy Flanagan&lt;/a&gt;, Lieutenant Governor of &lt;a href=\"Minnesota\"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; and a member of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Earth%20Band%20of%20Ojibwe\"&gt;White Earth Band of Ojibwe&lt;/a&gt;. However, the move was not without controversy within the Native community.\nDesJarlait's son, Robert DesJarlait, disagreed with claims that the logo was offensive or a stereotype. \u201cBasically, it was giving the previous generation a sense of almost empowerment to see a Native woman on a box of butter. It gave them a sense of cultural pride,\" he said. \"After seeing those posts, I said, 'that's right, that's why my dad created this image to begin with.\nAllegations of animal mistreatment by supplier.\nIn September 2009, &lt;a href=\"People%20for%20the%20Ethical%20Treatment%20of%20Animals\"&gt;People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals&lt;/a&gt; (PETA) released an undercover video allegedly depicting &lt;a href=\"animal%20abuse\"&gt;animal abuse&lt;/a&gt; of dairy cows at a &lt;a href=\"Pennsylvania\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; supplier for Land O\u2019Lakes, Inc. The video showed unclean conditions in the barn and milking parlor and cows with infections and illness. The supplier's employee was found not guilty of animal cruelty charges resulting from this incident and an investigation by veterinarians hired by Land O\u2019Lakes revealed no mistreatment of animals, but the veterinarians suggested that bedding, hygiene, ventilation and animal disposal practices be improved. Land O'Lakes states that it is supportive of the dairy industry's National Dairy F.A.R.M.: Farmers Assuring Responsible Management (FARM) animal care standards.\nIn May 2017, the animal rights organization &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Outlook\"&gt;Animal Outlook&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Compassion Over Killing) released undercover footage of cruelty to animals at DFA supplier Mason Dixon Farms, which documented \"cows being kicked in the face, punched in their sensitive udders, excessively shocked with an electric prod, jabbed with a pens or elbows, and having their tails twisted or bent by workers.\" The footage resulted in the firing of one employee.\nLicensing.\nSince August 2012, &lt;a href=\"WhiteWave%20Foods\"&gt;WhiteWave Foods&lt;/a&gt; has licensed the Land O'Lakes name and sold coffee creamers and fluid dairy products under the brand.\nLand O'Lakes brand milk is licensed to &lt;a href=\"Dean%20Foods\"&gt;Dean Foods&lt;/a&gt; in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin."
