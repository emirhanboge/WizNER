    "text": "Sawyer's Assembly Rooms in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Square\"&gt;Old Square&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; were the leading &lt;a href=\"assembly%20rooms\"&gt;assembly rooms&lt;/a&gt; in Birmingham during the early period of the &lt;a href=\"Midlands%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Midlands Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe room was opened by William Sawyer in 1740, taking over a property that had previously been used as a school. Before this the town's principal assembly rooms had been at the Hart's Head in Bull Street, which had served this purpose since 1649.\nAssemblies were held weekly at Sawyer's and included dancing, conversation and games of cards. Regular subscription concert series were also given at Sawyer's from the 1740s by &lt;a href=\"Barnabas%20Gunn\"&gt;Barnabas Gunn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Eversman\"&gt;John Eversman&lt;/a&gt; often being followed by a &lt;a href=\"Ball%20%28dance%29\"&gt;ball&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reputation of Sawyer's room as a fashionable venue never recovered from the visit of the &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Edward%2C%20Duke%20of%20York%20and%20Albany\"&gt;Duke of York&lt;/a&gt; in 1765, when he remarked that \"a town of such magnitude as Birmingham, and adorned with so much beauty, \ndeserved a superior accommodation, that the room itself was mean, but the entrance still meaner\" As a result of this insult, new assembly rooms were built at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Hotel%2C%20Birmingham\"&gt;Royal Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in Temple Row, funded by subscription and opening in 1772. Despite this, Sawyer's room continued under Sawyer's own ownership until 1779 when it was taken over by &lt;a href=\"James%20Cresshull\"&gt;James Cresshull&lt;/a&gt;, who operated it for a further 75 years."
