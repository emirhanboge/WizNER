    "text": "The Tykocin Royal Castle is a 15th-century castle located on the right bank of the river &lt;a href=\"Narew\"&gt;Narew&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tykocin\"&gt;Tykocin&lt;/a&gt;, Poland. It fell into ruin in the 18th century and its reconstruction began in 2002.\nHistory.\nThe castle \u2013 then located on a border area in the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Grand Duchy of Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 was built in 1433 for Lithuanian noble &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20Go%C5%A1tautas\"&gt;Jonas Go\u0161tautas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trakai%20Voivodeship\"&gt;voivode of Trakai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vilnius%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Vilnius&lt;/a&gt;, replacing the original wooden fortress. In the 1560s, upon the death of the last member of the Go\u0161tautas family the castle became the property of king &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%20II%20Augustus\"&gt;Sigismund II Augustus&lt;/a&gt;, who expanded it. The construction was supervised by Hiob Bretfus, military engineer and royal architect. During the reign of Sigismund Augustus the structure served as a royal residence with an impressive treasury and library as well as the main arsenal of the crown. In 1611\u20131632 the castle was rebuilt again and surrounded with &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt; fortifications by &lt;a href=\"Krzysztof%20Wiesio%C5%82owski\"&gt;Krzysztof Wiesio\u0142owski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"starosta\"&gt;starosta&lt;/a&gt; of Tykocin.\nDuring the 1655 &lt;a href=\"Deluge%20%28history%29\"&gt;Deluge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82%20family\"&gt;Radziwi\u0142\u0142&lt;/a&gt; army occupied the castle. On 31 December, 1655, when the castle was besieged by troops of the &lt;a href=\"Tyszowce%20Confederation\"&gt;Tyszowce Confederation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Janusz%20Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82%20%281612%E2%80%931655%29\"&gt;Janusz Radziwi\u0142\u0142&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most powerful people in the &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth\"&gt;Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; considered by some as the traitor, died here. Ultimately, the castle was captured on 27 January, 1657.\nIn the following years the castle and surrounding lands were donated to &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Czarniecki\"&gt;Stefan Czarniecki&lt;/a&gt; in reward for his contribution in the war. The new owner rebuilt the castle after 1698. In November 1705 the meeting between the king &lt;a href=\"Augustus%20II%20the%20Strong\"&gt;Augustus II the Strong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Peter%20I%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Peter the Great&lt;/a&gt; took place here. During this meeting the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20White%20Eagle%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Order of White Eagle&lt;/a&gt; was established by the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Polish%20monarchs\"&gt;King of Poland&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1734 the castle was destroyed by fire. Since that time, no inhabited building began to fall into disrepair. In 1771 remains of the castle were destroyed by flood and in 1914, during World War I, the material from the remaining walls was used by the German soldiers to build roads.\nBased on the preserved plans of the fortress, found in the archives in &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, the residential part of the castle has been restored (west wing in the style of late &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Gothic\"&gt;Gothic&lt;/a&gt;). The original castle was built on a plan of a &lt;a href=\"trapezoid\"&gt;trapezoid&lt;/a&gt; with a courtyard and four cylindrical towers at the corners. The complex was surrounded with fortifications \u2013 curtains combined four terrestrial inner bastions.\nTreasury.\nIn about 1565 the king Sigismund Augustus installed at the castle his private treasury and a collection of books, initially stored at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Palace%20of%20Lithuania\"&gt;Vilnius Castle&lt;/a&gt;. Sigismund Augustus was a passionate collector of jewels. According to &lt;a href=\"nuncio\"&gt;nuncio&lt;/a&gt; Bernardo Bongiovanni's relation, his collection was allocated in 16 chests. Among the precious items in his possession was &lt;a href=\"Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Charles V&lt;/a&gt;'s ruby of 80 000 &lt;a href=\"Italian%20scudo\"&gt;scudo&lt;/a&gt;s' worth, as well as the Emperor's diamond medal with &lt;a href=\"Habsburgs\"&gt;Habsburgs&lt;/a&gt; Eagle on one side and two columns with a sign \"&lt;a href=\"Plus%20Ultra%20%28motto%29\"&gt;Plus Ultra&lt;/a&gt;\" on the other side. He had also a &lt;a href=\"sultan\"&gt;sultan&lt;/a&gt;'s sword of 16 000 &lt;a href=\"ducat\"&gt;ducat&lt;/a&gt;s' worth, 30 precious horse trappings and 20 different private-use &lt;a href=\"armour\"&gt;armour&lt;/a&gt;s. The papal nuncio wrote in his diary \"I also saw twenty suits of royal armour of which four were of most wondrous workmanship, namely with a beautiful sculpture and figures set with silver [...] It cost six thousand scudos\". The king's possession included a rich &lt;a href=\"Jagiellonian%20tapestries\"&gt;collection of tapestries&lt;/a&gt; (360 pieces), commissioned by him in &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; in the years 1550\u20131560, which decorated the castle's walls. The king's treasures were scattered after his death."
