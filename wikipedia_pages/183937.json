    "text": "The winter wren (\"Troglodytes hiemalis\") is a very small &lt;a href=\"North%20American\"&gt;North American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; and a member of the mainly &lt;a href=\"New%20World\"&gt;New World&lt;/a&gt; wren family &lt;a href=\"Troglodytidae\"&gt;Troglodytidae&lt;/a&gt;. It was once lumped with \"&lt;a href=\"Pacific%20wren\"&gt;Troglodytes pacificus&lt;/a&gt;\" of western North America and \"&lt;a href=\"Eurasian%20wren\"&gt;Troglodytes troglodytes&lt;/a&gt;\" of &lt;a href=\"Eurasia\"&gt;Eurasia&lt;/a&gt; under the name winter wren.\nIt breeds in &lt;a href=\"coniferous%20forest\"&gt;coniferous forest&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; to the Atlantic Ocean. It migrates through and winters across southeastern &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the eastern half the United States and (rarely) north-eastern &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Small numbers may be casual in the western United States and Canada.\nThe scientific name is taken from the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; word \"troglodytes\" (from \"trogle\" a hole, and \"dyein\" to creep), meaning \"cave-dweller\", and refers to its habit of disappearing into cavities or crevices while hunting &lt;a href=\"arthropod\"&gt;arthropod&lt;/a&gt;s or to roost.\nDescription.\nSmall tail is often cocked above its back, and short neck gives the appearance of a small brown ball. &lt;a href=\"Rufous\"&gt;Rufous&lt;/a&gt; brown above, grayer below, barred with darker brown and gray, even on wings and tail. The bill is dark brown, the legs pale brown. Young birds are less distinctly barred. Most are identifiable by the pale \"eyebrows\" over their eyes.\nMeasurements:\nTaxonomy.\nBy studying the songs and &lt;a href=\"genetics\"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt; of individuals in an overlap zone between \"Troglodytes hiemalis\" and \"Troglodytes pacificus\", Toews and Irwin (2008) found strong evidence of &lt;a href=\"reproductive%20isolation\"&gt;reproductive isolation&lt;/a&gt; between the two. It was suggested that the \"pacificus\" subspecies be promoted to the species level designation of \"Troglodytes pacificus\" with the common name of \"Pacific wren\". By applying a &lt;a href=\"molecular%20clock\"&gt;molecular clock&lt;/a&gt; to the amount of &lt;a href=\"mitochondrial%20DNA\"&gt;mitochondrial DNA&lt;/a&gt; sequence divergence between the two, it was estimated that \"Troglodytes pacificus\" and \"Troglodytes troglodytes\" last shared a &lt;a href=\"common%20ancestor\"&gt;common ancestor&lt;/a&gt; approximately 4.3 million years ago, long before the glacial cycles of the &lt;a href=\"Pleistocene\"&gt;Pleistocene&lt;/a&gt;, thought to have promoted &lt;a href=\"speciation\"&gt;speciation&lt;/a&gt; in many avian systems inhabiting the boreal forest of North America.\nEcology.\nThe winter wren nests mostly in coniferous forests, especially those of &lt;a href=\"spruce\"&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fir\"&gt;fir&lt;/a&gt;, where it is often identified by its long and exuberant song. Although it is an &lt;a href=\"insectivore\"&gt;insectivore&lt;/a&gt;, it can remain in moderately cold and even snowy climates by foraging for insects on substrates such as bark and fallen logs.\nIts movements as it creeps or climbs are incessant rather than rapid; its short flights swift and direct but not sustained, its tiny round wings whirring as it flies from bush to bush.\nAt night, usually in winter, it often roosts, true to its scientific name, in dark retreats, snug holes and even old nests. In hard weather it may do so in parties, either consisting of the family or of many individuals gathered together for warmth.\nFor the most part &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s are its food, but in winter large pupae and some seeds are taken.\nBreeding.\nThe male builds a small number of nests. These are called \"cock nests\" but are never lined until the female chooses one to use.\nThe normal round nest of &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lichen\"&gt;lichen&lt;/a&gt;s or leaves is tucked into a hole in a wall, tree trunk, crack in a rock or corner of a building, but it is often built in bushes, overhanging boughs or the litter which accumulates in branches washed by floods.\nFive to eight white or slightly speckled &lt;a href=\"Bird%20egg\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; are laid in April, and second broods are reared."
