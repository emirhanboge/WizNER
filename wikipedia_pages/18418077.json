    "text": "Hermann Thyr\u00e4us (b. at &lt;a href=\"Neuss\"&gt;Neuss&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Rhine\"&gt;Rhine&lt;/a&gt;, 1532; d. at &lt;a href=\"Mainz\"&gt;Mainz&lt;/a&gt;, 26 October 1591) was a German &lt;a href=\"Jesuit\"&gt;Jesuit&lt;/a&gt; theologian and preacher.\nLife.\nHe studied first at &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;, and then, after 1522, at the &lt;a href=\"Collegium%20Germanicum\"&gt;Collegium Germanicum&lt;/a&gt; at Rome. On 26 May 1556, he was received into the Society of Jesus by &lt;a href=\"Ignatius%20Loyola\"&gt;Ignatius Loyola&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the same year, Thyr\u00e4us was made a professor of theology at &lt;a href=\"Ingolstadt\"&gt;Ingolstadt&lt;/a&gt;, where he taught for three years the \"Magister sententiarum\", and in the fourth year controversial theology. In 1560 he became a professor at &lt;a href=\"Trier\"&gt;Trier&lt;/a&gt;, and lectured on the &lt;a href=\"Epistles%20of%20St.%20Paul\"&gt;Epistles of St. Paul&lt;/a&gt;. He was rector of the college at Trier (1565\u201370), provincial of the Jesuit province of the Rhine (1571-8), and from 1578 until his death rector of the college at &lt;a href=\"Mainz\"&gt;Mainz&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe archbishops of the Rhine often employed him in important matters. He was also a noted preacher. When he occupied the pulpit at Trier as many as 4000 people often came together to hear him.\nWorks.\nThe \"Liber de religionis libertate\", ascribed to him, was written most probably by his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Thyraeus\"&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, also a Jesuit. His \"Confessio Augustana\", with controversial notes, appeared at &lt;a href=\"Dillingen%20an%20der%20Donau\"&gt;Dillingen&lt;/a&gt; in 1567. He also left several volumes of sermons."
