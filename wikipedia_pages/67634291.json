However, 9 of the returning finalists had already won the title in prior seasons (&lt;a href=\"Juliana%20Didone\"&gt;Juliana Didone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robson%20da%20Silva\"&gt;Robson Caetano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christiane%20Torloni\"&gt;Christiane Torloni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paolla%20Oliveira\"&gt;Paolla Oliveira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rodrigo%20Simas\"&gt;Rodrigo Simas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marcello%20Melo%20Jr.\"&gt;Marcello Melo Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Viviane%20Ara%C3%BAjo%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Viviane Ara\u00fajo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Joana\"&gt;Maria Joana&lt;/a&gt; and Lucy Ramos). \nSeason 12 saw the most returning contestants, with 3 out of the 18 contestants (Arthur Aguiar, Mariana Santos and &lt;a href=\"Viviane%20Ara%C3%BAjo%20%28actress%29\"&gt;Viviane Ara\u00fajo&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Christiane%20Torloni\"&gt;Christiane Torloni&lt;/a&gt; is the only contestant reunited with her original partner. \nIt was the last season hosted by &lt;a href=\"Fausto%20Silva\"&gt;Fausto Silva&lt;/a&gt; and airing as a segment on \"&lt;a href=\"Doming%C3%A3o%20do%20Faust%C3%A3o\"&gt;Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o&lt;/a&gt;\", as the show was planned to air its series finale on December 26, 2021.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiago%20Leifert\"&gt;Tiago Leifert&lt;/a&gt; filled in as host on June 13, 2021, when Fausto Silva had to leave the show in week 5 due to an infection, with Silva expected to return the following week.
