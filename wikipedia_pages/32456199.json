He graduated with a degree in theology in 1795 but did not join the ministry. He was engaged in trade in Farsund with his father, merchant, trader and shipowner &lt;a href=\"Jochum%20Brinch%20Lund\"&gt;Jochum Brinch Lund&lt;/a&gt; (1743-1807) He subsequently took over the trading house and ran it until 1830. Later he served as postmaster in &lt;a href=\"Trondheim\"&gt;Trondheim&lt;/a&gt;. He represented &lt;a href=\"Vest-Agder\"&gt;Lister amt&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Constituent%20Assembly\"&gt;Norwegian Constituent Assembly&lt;/a&gt; in 1814. He was a member of the Finance Committee and supported the independence party (\"Selvstendighetspartiet\").\nHe was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Parliament of Norway&lt;/a&gt; from 1827 to 1830 representing Lister and Mandals amt (now &lt;a href=\"Vest-Agder\"&gt;Vest-Agder&lt;/a&gt;).\nHe was married to Gidsken Edvardine R\u00f8ring (1781-1841) with whom he had seven children. The family resided at Husan Manor in Farsund which had been built by Jochum Brinch Lund ca 1800. The original wooden structure was partially destroyed by fire in 1940. It was later restored and is now in use as the Farsund City Hall (\"Husan, Farsunds r\u00e5dhus\"). In 1990, the city of Farsund received the \u201cEuropa Nostra\u201d prize for the successful restoration of the former manor house."
