    "text": "Lycoris is a &lt;a href=\"genus\"&gt;genus&lt;/a&gt; of 13\u201320 species of &lt;a href=\"flowering%20plant\"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt;s in the family &lt;a href=\"Amaryllidaceae\"&gt;Amaryllidaceae&lt;/a&gt;, subfamily &lt;a href=\"Amaryllidoideae\"&gt;Amaryllidoideae&lt;/a&gt;. They are native to eastern and southern &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; in China, Japan, southern &lt;a href=\"Korea\"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href=\"Laos\"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href=\"Burma\"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, and eastern &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. They were imported into &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and now grow wild. In English they are also called hurricane lilies or cluster amaryllis. The genus shares the English name &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Lily%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;spider lily&lt;/a&gt; with two other related genera.\nThey are &lt;a href=\"bulb\"&gt;bulb&lt;/a&gt;-producing &lt;a href=\"perennial%20plant\"&gt;perennial plant&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"leaf\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are long and slender, 30\u201360\u00a0cm long and only 0.5\u20132\u00a0cm broad. The &lt;a href=\"scape%20%28botany%29\"&gt;scape&lt;/a&gt; is erect, 30\u201370\u00a0cm tall, bearing a terminal &lt;a href=\"umbel\"&gt;umbel&lt;/a&gt; of four to eight &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be white, yellow, orange, or red. The flowers divide into two types, those with very long, filamentous &lt;a href=\"stamen\"&gt;stamen&lt;/a&gt;s two or three times as long as the &lt;a href=\"tepal\"&gt;tepal&lt;/a&gt;s (subgenus \"Lycoris\"; e.g. \"Lycoris radiata\"), and those with shorter stamens not much longer than the tepals (subgenus \"Symmanthus\" Traub &amp; Moldenke; e.g. \"Lycoris sanguinea\"). The &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; is a three-valved &lt;a href=\"capsule%20%28fruit%29\"&gt;capsule&lt;/a&gt; containing several black &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s. Many of the species are sterile, reproducing only vegetatively, and are probably of &lt;a href=\"Hybrid%20%28biology%29\"&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt; origin; several additional known hybrids occur.\nSelected species.\n, the \"World Checklist of Selected Plant Families\" recognizes 22 species and one hybrid:\nA few names have been coined using the name \"Lycoris\" but referring to species now considered better suited to other genera (\"&lt;a href=\"Griffinia\"&gt;Griffinia&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Ungernia\"&gt;Ungernia&lt;/a&gt;\"). Here are links to help you find appropriate information.\nCultivation and uses.\n\"Lycoris\" are extensively cultivated as &lt;a href=\"ornamental%20plant\"&gt;ornamental plant&lt;/a&gt;s in China and Japan, and also in other warm temperate regions of the world. In Japan, they are widely used at the edges of &lt;a href=\"rice\"&gt;rice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paddy%20field\"&gt;paddy field&lt;/a&gt;s to provide a strip of bright flowers in the summer, and over 230 &lt;a href=\"cultivar\"&gt;cultivar&lt;/a&gt;s have been selected for garden use. They are locally &lt;a href=\"naturalisation%20%28biology%29\"&gt;naturalised&lt;/a&gt; in the southeastern United States, where they are often called hurricane flowers, due to their blooming period coinciding with the peak of hurricane season. In China, people often use them as decorations in festivals or celebrations.\nLegends.\nSince these scarlet flowers usually bloom near &lt;a href=\"cemeteries\"&gt;cemeteries&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a href=\"September%20equinox\"&gt;autumnal equinox&lt;/a&gt;, they are described in Chinese and Japanese translations of the &lt;a href=\"Lotus%20Sutra\"&gt;Lotus Sutra&lt;/a&gt; as ominous flowers that grow in &lt;a href=\"Diyu\"&gt;Diyu&lt;/a&gt; (also known as Hell), or Hu\u00e1ngqu\u00e1n (&lt;a href=\"Simplified%20Chinese\"&gt;Simplified Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: \u9ec4\u6cc9; &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Chinese\"&gt;Traditional Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: \u9ec3\u6cc9), and guide the dead into the next reincarnation.\nWhen the flowers of \"lycoris\" bloom, their leaves would have fallen; when their leaves grow, the flowers would have wilted. This habit gave rise to various legends. A famous one is the legend of two &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Manjushri\"&gt;Ma\u00f1ju&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Simplified%20Chinese\"&gt;Simplified Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: \u66fc\u73e0; &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Chinese\"&gt;Traditional Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: \u66fc\u73e0), who guarded the flower, and Saka (&lt;a href=\"Simplified%20Chinese\"&gt;Simplified Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: \u6c99\u534e; &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Chinese\"&gt;Traditional Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: \u6c99\u83ef), who guarded the leaves. Out of curiosity, they defied their &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Afate\"&gt;fate&lt;/a&gt; of guarding the herb alone, and managed to meet each other. At first sight, they fell in love with each other. &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;, exasperated by their waywardness, separated the miserable couple, and laid a curse on them as a punishment: the flowers of Ma\u00f1ju shall never meet the leaves of Saka again.\nIt was said that when the couple met after death in &lt;a href=\"Diyu\"&gt;Diyu&lt;/a&gt;, they vowed to meet each other after &lt;a href=\"reincarnation\"&gt;reincarnation&lt;/a&gt;. However, neither of them could keep their word.\nIn commemoration of the couple, some call the herbs \"Ma\u00f1jusaka\" (&lt;a href=\"Simplified%20Chinese\"&gt;Simplified Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: \u66fc\u73e0\u6c99\u534e; &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Chinese\"&gt;Traditional Chinese&lt;/a&gt;: \u66fc\u73e0\u6c99\u83ef), a mixture of \"Ma\u00f1ju\" and \"Saka\", instead of their &lt;a href=\"scientific%20name\"&gt;scientific name&lt;/a&gt;. The same name is used in Japanese, in which it is pronounced \"manju-syage\".\nSome other legends have it that when a person sees someone that they may never meet again, these flowers, also called red spider lilies, would bloom along the path. Perhaps because of these sorrowful legends, &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20people\"&gt;Japanese people&lt;/a&gt; often used these flowers in &lt;a href=\"funerals\"&gt;funerals&lt;/a&gt;. Popular name of Japanese for lycoris is literally &lt;a href=\"higan\"&gt;higan&lt;/a&gt; (the other or that shore of &lt;a href=\"Sanzu%20River\"&gt;sanzu river&lt;/a&gt;) flower means, decorate and enjoyable, flower of &lt;a href=\"afterlife\"&gt;afterlife&lt;/a&gt; in ."
