The town was one of the few municipalities in &lt;a href=\"West%20Germany\"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt; that imported electric power from former &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;. This was done via &lt;a href=\"Neuhof%20Substation\"&gt;Neuhof Substation&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nBad Sachsa is situated in the southern &lt;a href=\"Harz\"&gt;Harz&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 15\u00a0km south of &lt;a href=\"Braunlage\"&gt;Braunlage&lt;/a&gt;, and 25\u00a0km southeast of &lt;a href=\"Osterode%20am%20Harz\"&gt;Osterode am Harz&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe oldest existing document in which Sachsa is mentioned was written in 1229.
