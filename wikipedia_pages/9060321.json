    "text": "Black Science Orchestra was a musical project headed chiefly by the British DJ and producer &lt;a href=\"Ashley%20Beedle\"&gt;Ashley Beedle&lt;/a&gt;, which produced a number of &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rare%20groove\"&gt;rare groove&lt;/a&gt;-inspired &lt;a href=\"house%20music\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; records in the 1990s.\nHistory.\nEnlisting the help of Rob Mello and John Howard, Black Science Orchestra made their debut in 1992 with \"Where Were You\", a reworking of the classic &lt;a href=\"Trammps\"&gt;Trammps&lt;/a&gt; tune \"Where Were You (When the Lights Went Out?)\". The record was given exposure by &lt;a href=\"Frankie%20Knuckles\"&gt;Frankie Knuckles&lt;/a&gt;, and their subsequent releases found favour with both Knuckles and the &lt;a href=\"Masters%20at%20Work\"&gt;Masters at Work&lt;/a&gt; team over the course of 1992 and 1993.Legal disputes, however, delayed the release of the debut Black Science Orchestra album, and when it finally appeared in 1996 it was with a revised line-up of Beedle, Marc Woolford &amp; Uschi Classen."
