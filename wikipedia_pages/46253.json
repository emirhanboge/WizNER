    "text": "Fever, also referred to as pyrexia, is defined as having a &lt;a href=\"body%20temperature\"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"human%20body%20temperature\"&gt;normal range&lt;/a&gt; due to an increase in the body's temperature &lt;a href=\"Human%20body%20temperature%23Fever\"&gt;set point&lt;/a&gt;. There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between in humans. The increase in set point triggers increased &lt;a href=\"muscle%20tone\"&gt;muscle contraction&lt;/a&gt;s and causes a feeling of &lt;a href=\"cold\"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"chills\"&gt;chills&lt;/a&gt;. This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat. When the set point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes &lt;a href=\"Flushing%20%28physiology%29\"&gt;flushed&lt;/a&gt;, and may begin to &lt;a href=\"Perspiration\"&gt;sweat&lt;/a&gt;. Rarely a fever may trigger a &lt;a href=\"febrile%20seizure\"&gt;febrile seizure&lt;/a&gt;, with this being more common in young children. Fevers do not typically go higher than .\nA fever can be caused by many &lt;a href=\"medical%20conditions\"&gt;medical conditions&lt;/a&gt; ranging from non-serious to &lt;a href=\"life-threatening\"&gt;life-threatening&lt;/a&gt;. This includes &lt;a href=\"viral%20infection\"&gt;viral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bacterial%20infection\"&gt;bacterial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"parasitic%20infections\"&gt;parasitic infections&lt;/a&gt;\u2014such as &lt;a href=\"influenza\"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"common%20cold\"&gt;common cold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"meningitis\"&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"urinary%20tract%20infections\"&gt;urinary tract infections&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"appendicitis\"&gt;appendicitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"malaria\"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;. Non-infectious causes include &lt;a href=\"vasculitis\"&gt;vasculitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"deep%20vein%20thrombosis\"&gt;deep vein thrombosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"connective%20tissue%20disease\"&gt;connective tissue disease&lt;/a&gt;, side effects of medication or vaccination, and &lt;a href=\"cancer\"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It differs from &lt;a href=\"hyperthermia\"&gt;hyperthermia&lt;/a&gt;, in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough &lt;a href=\"thermoregulation\"&gt;heat loss&lt;/a&gt;.\nTreatment to reduce fever is generally not required. Treatment of associated pain and inflammation, however, may be useful and help a person rest. Medications such as &lt;a href=\"ibuprofen\"&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"paracetamol\"&gt;paracetamol&lt;/a&gt; (acetaminophen) may help with this as well as lower temperature. Children younger than three months require medical attention, as might people with serious medical problems such as a &lt;a href=\"compromised%20immune%20system\"&gt;compromised immune system&lt;/a&gt; or people with other symptoms. &lt;a href=\"Hyperthermia\"&gt;Hyperthermia&lt;/a&gt; does require treatment.\nFever is one of the most common &lt;a href=\"medical%20signs\"&gt;medical signs&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick. While fever evolved as a defense mechanism, treating fever does not appear to worsen outcomes. Fever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than is usually deserved, a phenomenon known as fever phobia.\nAssociated symptoms.\nA fever is usually accompanied by &lt;a href=\"sickness%20behavior\"&gt;sickness behavior&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of &lt;a href=\"lethargy\"&gt;lethargy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Depression%20%28mood%29\"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anorexia%20%28symptom%29\"&gt;loss of appetite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sleepiness\"&gt;sleepiness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hyperalgesia\"&gt;hyperalgesia&lt;/a&gt;, and the inability to concentrate. Sleeping with a fever can often cause intense or confusing nightmares, commonly called \"fever dreams\". Mild to severe &lt;a href=\"delirium\"&gt;delirium&lt;/a&gt; (which can also cause &lt;a href=\"hallucinations\"&gt;hallucinations&lt;/a&gt;) may also present itself during high fevers.\nDiagnosis.\nA range for &lt;a href=\"Normal%20human%20body%20temperature\"&gt;normal temperatures&lt;/a&gt; has been found. Central temperatures, such as rectal temperatures, are more accurate than peripheral temperatures.\nFever is generally agreed to be present if the elevated temperature is caused by a raised set point and:\nIn adults, the &lt;a href=\"Normal%20human%20body%20temperature\"&gt;normal range&lt;/a&gt; of oral temperatures in healthy individuals is among men and among women, while when taken rectally it is among men and among women, and for &lt;a href=\"tympanic%20membrane\"&gt;ear&lt;/a&gt; measurement it is among men and among women.\nNormal body temperatures vary depending on many factors, including age, sex, time of day, ambient temperature, activity level, and more. Normal daily temperature variation has been described as 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F). A raised temperature is not always a fever. For example, the temperature rises in healthy people when they exercise, but this is not considered a fever, as the set point is normal. On the other hand, a \"normal\" temperature may be a fever, if it is unusually high for that person; for example, &lt;a href=\"medically%20frail\"&gt;medically frail&lt;/a&gt; elderly people have a decreased ability to generate body heat, so a \"normal\" temperature of may represent a clinically significant fever.\nHyperthermia.\n&lt;a href=\"Hyperthermia\"&gt;Hyperthermia&lt;/a&gt; is an elevation of body temperature over the temperature set point, due to either too much heat production or not enough &lt;a href=\"thermoregulation\"&gt;heat loss&lt;/a&gt;. Hyperthermia is thus not considered fever. Hyperthermia is not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"hyperpyrexia\"&gt;hyperpyrexia&lt;/a&gt; (which is a very high fever).\nClinically, it is important to distinguish between fever and hyperthermia as hyperthermia may quickly lead to death and does not respond to antipyretic medications. The distinction may however be difficult to make in an emergency setting, and is often established by identifying possible causes.\nTypes.\nVarious patterns of measured patient temperatures have been observed, some of which may be indicative of a particular &lt;a href=\"medical%20diagnosis\"&gt;medical diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;:\nAmong the types of intermittent fever are ones specific to cases of malaria caused by different pathogens. These are:\nIn addition, there is disagreement regarding whether a specific fever pattern is associated with &lt;a href=\"Hodgkin%27s%20lymphoma\"&gt;Hodgkin's lymphoma&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Pel%E2%80%93Ebstein%20fever\"&gt;Pel\u2013Ebstein fever&lt;/a&gt;, with patients argued to present high temperature for one week, followed by low for the next week, and so on, where the generality of this pattern is debated.\nPersistent fever that cannot be explained after repeated routine clinical inquiries is called &lt;a href=\"fever%20of%20unknown%20origin\"&gt;fever of unknown origin&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"neutropenic%20fever\"&gt;neutropenic fever&lt;/a&gt;, also called febrile neutropenia, is a fever in the absence of normal immune system function. Because of the lack of infection-fighting &lt;a href=\"neutrophil\"&gt;neutrophil&lt;/a&gt;s, a bacterial infection can spread rapidly; this fever is, therefore, usually considered to require urgent medical attention. This kind of fever is more commonly seen in people receiving immune-suppressing &lt;a href=\"chemotherapy\"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; than in apparently healthy people.\nAn old term, \"febricula\", has been used to refer to low-grade fever, especially if the cause is unknown, no other symptoms are present, and the patient recovers fully in less than a week.\nHyperpyrexia.\nHyperpyrexia is an extreme elevation of &lt;a href=\"body%20temperature\"&gt;body temperature&lt;/a&gt; which, depending upon the source, is classified as a &lt;a href=\"core%20body%20temperature\"&gt;core body temperature&lt;/a&gt; greater than or equal to ; the range of hyperpyrexias include cases considered severe (\u2265 40\u00a0\u00b0C) and extreme (\u2265 42\u00a0\u00b0C). It differs from &lt;a href=\"hyperthermia\"&gt;hyperthermia&lt;/a&gt; in that one's &lt;a href=\"Human%20thermoregulation%23Thermoregulation%20in%20humans\"&gt;thermoregulatory system's set point&lt;/a&gt; for body temperature is set above normal, then heat is generated to achieve it. In contrast, hyperthermia involves body temperature rising above its &lt;a href=\"Human%20thermoregulation%23Thermoregulation%20in%20humans\"&gt;set point&lt;/a&gt; due to outside factors. The high temperatures of hyperpyrexia are considered &lt;a href=\"medical%20emergency\"&gt;medical emergencies&lt;/a&gt;, as they may indicate a serious underlying condition or lead to severe morbidity (including permanent &lt;a href=\"brain%20damage\"&gt;brain damage&lt;/a&gt;), or to death. A common cause of hyperpyrexia is an &lt;a href=\"intracranial%20hemorrhage\"&gt;intracranial hemorrhage&lt;/a&gt;. Other causes in emergency room settings include &lt;a href=\"sepsis\"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kawasaki%20syndrome\"&gt;Kawasaki syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"neuroleptic%20malignant%20syndrome\"&gt;neuroleptic malignant syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drug%20overdose\"&gt;drug overdose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"serotonin%20syndrome\"&gt;serotonin syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"thyroid%20storm\"&gt;thyroid storm&lt;/a&gt;.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nFever is a common &lt;a href=\"symptom\"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; of many medical conditions:\nAdult and pediatric manifestations for the same disease may differ; for instance, in &lt;a href=\"COVID-19\"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, one metastudy describes 92.8% of adults versus 43.9% of children presenting with fever.\nIn addition, fever can result from a reaction to an incompatible blood product.\n&lt;a href=\"Teething\"&gt;Teething&lt;/a&gt; is not a cause of fever.\nSelective advantage.\nScholars viewing fever from an organismal and evolutionary perspective note the value to an organism of having a fever response, in particular in response to infective disease. On the other hand, while fever evolved as a defense mechanism, treating fever does not appear to worsen outcomes. Studies using &lt;a href=\"warm-blooded\"&gt;warm-blooded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vertebrates\"&gt;vertebrates&lt;/a&gt; suggest that they recover more rapidly from infections or critical illness due to fever. Other studies suggest reduced mortality in bacterial infections when fever was present. Fever is thought to contribute to host defense, as the reproduction of &lt;a href=\"pathogen\"&gt;pathogen&lt;/a&gt;s with strict temperature requirements can be hindered, and the rates of some important immunological reactions are increased by temperature. Fever has been described in teaching texts as assisting the healing process in various ways, including:\nPathophysiology.\nHypothalamus.\nTemperature is regulated in the &lt;a href=\"hypothalamus\"&gt;hypothalamus&lt;/a&gt;. The trigger of a fever, called a pyrogen, results in the release of &lt;a href=\"prostaglandin%20E2\"&gt;prostaglandin E2&lt;/a&gt; (PGE2). PGE2 in turn acts on the hypothalamus, which creates a systemic response in the body, causing heat-generating effects to match a new higher temperature set point. There are four receptors in which PGE2 can bind (EP1-4), with a previous study showing the EP3 subtype is what mediates the fever response. Hence, the hypothalamus can be seen as working like a &lt;a href=\"thermostat\"&gt;thermostat&lt;/a&gt;. When the set point is raised, the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retention of heat. Peripheral &lt;a href=\"vasoconstriction\"&gt;vasoconstriction&lt;/a&gt; both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold. &lt;a href=\"Norepinephrine\"&gt;Norepinephrine&lt;/a&gt; increases &lt;a href=\"thermogenesis\"&gt;thermogenesis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"brown%20adipose%20tissue\"&gt;brown adipose tissue&lt;/a&gt;, and muscle contraction through shivering raises the &lt;a href=\"Basal%20metabolic%20rate\"&gt;metabolic rate&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new set point in the hypothalamus, the brain orchestrates heat effector mechanisms via the &lt;a href=\"autonomic%20nervous%20system\"&gt;autonomic nervous system&lt;/a&gt; or primary motor center for shivering. These may be:\nWhen the hypothalamic set point moves back to baseline\u2014either spontaneously or via medication\u2014normal functions such as sweating, and the reverse of the foregoing processes (e.g., vasodilation, end of shivering, and nonshivering heat production) are used to cool the body to the new, lower setting.\nThis contrasts with &lt;a href=\"hyperthermia\"&gt;hyperthermia&lt;/a&gt;, in which the normal setting remains, and the body overheats through undesirable retention of excess heat or over-production of heat. Hyperthermia is usually the result of an excessively hot environment (&lt;a href=\"heat%20stroke\"&gt;heat stroke&lt;/a&gt;) or an adverse reaction to drugs. Fever can be differentiated from hyperthermia by the circumstances surrounding it and its response to &lt;a href=\"anti-pyretic\"&gt;anti-pyretic&lt;/a&gt; medications.\nIn infants, the autonomic nervous system may also activate &lt;a href=\"brown%20adipose%20tissue\"&gt;brown adipose tissue&lt;/a&gt; to produce heat (non-exercise-associated &lt;a href=\"thermogenesis\"&gt;thermogenesis&lt;/a&gt;, also known as non-shivering thermogenesis).\nIncreased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased &lt;a href=\"blood%20pressure\"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; in fever.\nPyrogens.\nA pyrogen is a substance that induces fever. In the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria, viruses, viroids, \"etc\"., the immune response of the body is to inhibit their growth and eliminate them. The most common pyrogens are endotoxins, which are lipopolysaccharides (LPS) produced by &lt;a href=\"Gram-negative%20bacteria\"&gt;Gram-negative bacteria&lt;/a&gt; such as \"&lt;a href=\"Escherichia%20coli\"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt;.\" But pyrogens include non-endotoxic substances (derived from microorganisms other than gram-negative-bacteria or from chemical substances) as well. The types of pyrogens include internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) to the body.\nThe \"pyrogenicity\" of given pyrogens varies: in extreme cases, bacterial pyrogens can act as &lt;a href=\"superantigens\"&gt;superantigens&lt;/a&gt; and cause rapid and dangerous fevers. \nEndogenous.\nEndogenous pyrogens are &lt;a href=\"cytokine\"&gt;cytokine&lt;/a&gt;s released from &lt;a href=\"monocyte\"&gt;monocyte&lt;/a&gt;s (which are part of the &lt;a href=\"immune%20system\"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;). In general, they stimulate chemical responses, often in the presence of an &lt;a href=\"antigen\"&gt;antigen&lt;/a&gt;, leading to a fever. Whilst they can be a product of external factors like exogenous pyrogens, they can also be induced by internal factors like damage associated from molecular patterns such as cases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.\nMajor endogenous pyrogens are &lt;a href=\"interleukin%201\"&gt;interleukin 1&lt;/a&gt; (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and &lt;a href=\"interleukin%206\"&gt;interleukin 6&lt;/a&gt; (IL-6). Minor endogenous pyrogens include &lt;a href=\"interleukin-8\"&gt;interleukin-8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lymphotoxin%20alpha\"&gt;tumor necrosis factor-\u03b2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"macrophage%20inflammatory%20protein\"&gt;macrophage inflammatory protein&lt;/a&gt;-\u03b1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-\u03b2 as well as &lt;a href=\"interferon-%CE%B1\"&gt;interferon-\u03b1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"IFN-%CE%B2\"&gt;interferon-\u03b2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Interferon-gamma\"&gt;interferon-\u03b3&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tumor%20necrosis%20factor-%CE%B1\"&gt;Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1&lt;/a&gt; (TNF) also acts as a pyrogen, mediated by &lt;a href=\"interleukin%201\"&gt;interleukin 1&lt;/a&gt; (IL-1) release. These cytokine factors are released into general circulation, where they migrate to the brain's &lt;a href=\"circumventricular%20organ\"&gt;circumventricular organ&lt;/a&gt;s where they are more easily absorbed than in areas protected by the &lt;a href=\"blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier\"&gt;blood\u2013brain barrier&lt;/a&gt;. The cytokines then bind to &lt;a href=\"endothelium\"&gt;endothelial receptor&lt;/a&gt;s on vessel walls to receptors on &lt;a href=\"microglial%20cell\"&gt;microglial cell&lt;/a&gt;s, resulting in activation of the &lt;a href=\"arachidonic%20acid%20pathway\"&gt;arachidonic acid pathway&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf these, IL-1\u03b2, TNF, and IL-6 are able to raise the temperature setpoint of an organism and cause fever. These proteins produce a &lt;a href=\"cyclooxygenase\"&gt;cyclooxygenase&lt;/a&gt; which induces the hypothalamic production of PGE2 which then stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate and increases body temperature.\nExogenous.\nExogenous pyrogens are external to the body and are of microbial origin. In general, these pyrogens, including bacterial cell wall products, may act on Toll-like receptors in the hypothalamus and elevate the thermoregulatory setpoint.\nAn example of a class of exogenous pyrogens are bacterial &lt;a href=\"lipopolysaccharide\"&gt;lipopolysaccharide&lt;/a&gt;s (LPS) present in the cell wall of &lt;a href=\"gram-negative%20bacteria\"&gt;gram-negative bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. According to one mechanism of pyrogen action, an immune system protein, &lt;a href=\"lipopolysaccharide-binding%20protein\"&gt;lipopolysaccharide-binding protein&lt;/a&gt; (LBP), binds to LPS, and the LBP\u2013LPS complex then binds to a &lt;a href=\"CD14\"&gt;CD14&lt;/a&gt; receptor on a &lt;a href=\"macrophage\"&gt;macrophage&lt;/a&gt;. The LBP-LPS binding to CD14 results in cellular synthesis and release of various endogenous &lt;a href=\"cytokine\"&gt;cytokine&lt;/a&gt;s, e.g., interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1). A further downstream event is activation of the &lt;a href=\"arachidonic%20acid%20pathway\"&gt;arachidonic acid pathway&lt;/a&gt;.\nPGE2 release.\nPGE2 release comes from the &lt;a href=\"arachidonic%20acid\"&gt;arachidonic acid&lt;/a&gt; pathway. This pathway (as it relates to fever), is mediated by the &lt;a href=\"enzyme\"&gt;enzyme&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"phospholipase\"&gt;phospholipase A2&lt;/a&gt; (PLA2), &lt;a href=\"cyclooxygenase\"&gt;cyclooxygenase-2&lt;/a&gt; (COX-2), and &lt;a href=\"prostaglandin%20E2%20synthase\"&gt;prostaglandin E2 synthase&lt;/a&gt;. These enzymes ultimately mediate the synthesis and release of PGE2.\nPGE2 is the ultimate mediator of the febrile response. The setpoint temperature of the body will remain elevated until PGE2 is no longer present. PGE2 acts on neurons in the &lt;a href=\"preoptic%20area\"&gt;preoptic area&lt;/a&gt; (POA) through the &lt;a href=\"prostaglandin%20E%20receptor%203\"&gt;prostaglandin E receptor 3&lt;/a&gt; (EP3). EP3-expressing neurons in the POA innervate the &lt;a href=\"dorsomedial%20hypothalamus\"&gt;dorsomedial hypothalamus&lt;/a&gt; (DMH), the rostral &lt;a href=\"raphe\"&gt;raphe&lt;/a&gt; pallidus nucleus in the &lt;a href=\"medulla%20oblongata\"&gt;medulla oblongata&lt;/a&gt; (rRPa), and the &lt;a href=\"paraventricular%20nucleus\"&gt;paraventricular nucleus&lt;/a&gt; (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Fever signals sent to the DMH and rRPa lead to stimulation of the &lt;a href=\"Sympathetic%20nervous%20system\"&gt;sympathetic&lt;/a&gt; output system, which evokes non-shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface. It is presumed that the innervation from the POA to the PVN mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving &lt;a href=\"pituitary%20gland\"&gt;pituitary gland&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"endocrine%20organs\"&gt;endocrine organs&lt;/a&gt;.\nManagement.\nFever does not necessarily need to be treated, and most people with a fever recover without specific medical attention. Although it is unpleasant, fever rarely rises to a dangerous level even if untreated. Damage to the brain generally does not occur until temperatures reach 42\u00a0\u00b0C (107.6\u00a0\u00b0F), and it is rare for an untreated fever to exceed 40.6\u00a0\u00b0C (105\u00a0\u00b0F). Treating fever in people with &lt;a href=\"sepsis\"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; does not affect outcomes.\nConservative measures.\nLimited evidence supports sponging or bathing feverish children with tepid water. The use of a &lt;a href=\"mechanical%20fan\"&gt;fan&lt;/a&gt; or air conditioning may somewhat reduce the temperature and increase comfort. If the temperature reaches the extremely high level of &lt;a href=\"hyperpyrexia\"&gt;hyperpyrexia&lt;/a&gt;, aggressive cooling is required (generally produced mechanically via &lt;a href=\"conduction%20%28heat%29\"&gt;conduction&lt;/a&gt; by applying numerous ice packs across most of the body or direct submersion in ice water). In general, people are advised to keep adequately hydrated. Whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illnesses such as the &lt;a href=\"common%20cold\"&gt;common cold&lt;/a&gt; is not known.\nMedications.\nMedications that lower fevers are called \"&lt;a href=\"antipyretic\"&gt;antipyretic&lt;/a&gt;s\". The antipyretic &lt;a href=\"ibuprofen\"&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt; is effective in reducing fevers in children. It is more effective than &lt;a href=\"acetaminophen\"&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt; (paracetamol) in children. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen may be safely used together in children with fevers. The efficacy of acetaminophen by itself in children with fevers has been questioned. Ibuprofen is also superior to &lt;a href=\"aspirin\"&gt;aspirin&lt;/a&gt; in children with fevers. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"aspirin\"&gt;aspirin&lt;/a&gt; is not recommended in children and young adults (those under the age of 16 or 19 depending on the country) due to the risk of &lt;a href=\"Reye%27s%20syndrome\"&gt;Reye's syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time or alternating between the two is more effective at decreasing fever than using only paracetamol or ibuprofen. It is not clear if it increases child comfort. Response or nonresponse to medications does not predict whether or not a child has a serious illness.\nWith respect to the effect of antipyretics on the risk of death in those with infection, studies have found mixed results as of 2019. Animal models have found worsened outcomes with the use of antipyretics in influenza as of 2010 but they have not been studied for this use in humans.\nEpidemiology.\nFever is one of the most common &lt;a href=\"medical%20signs\"&gt;medical signs&lt;/a&gt;. It is part of about 30% of healthcare visits by children, and occurs in up to 75% of adults who are seriously sick. About 5% of people who go to an emergency room have a fever.\nHistory.\nA number of types of fever were known as early as 460 BC to 370 BC when &lt;a href=\"Hippocrates\"&gt;Hippocrates&lt;/a&gt; was practicing medicine including that due to &lt;a href=\"malaria\"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; (tertian or every 2 days and quartan or every 3 days). It also became clear around this time that fever was a symptom of disease rather than a disease in and of itself.\nInfections presenting with fever were a major source of mortality in humans for about 200,000 years. Until the late nineteenth century, approximately half of all humans died from infections before the age of fifteen.\nSociety and culture.\nFever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than might be deserved, a phenomenon known as fever phobia, which is based in both caregiver's and parents' misconceptions about fever in children. Among them, many parents incorrectly believe that fever is a &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; rather than a &lt;a href=\"medical%20sign\"&gt;medical sign&lt;/a&gt;, that even low fevers are harmful, and that any temperature even briefly or slightly above the oversimplified \"normal\" number marked on a thermometer is a clinically significant fever. They are also afraid of harmless side effects like &lt;a href=\"febrile%20seizure\"&gt;febrile seizure&lt;/a&gt;s and dramatically overestimate the likelihood of permanent damage from typical fevers. The underlying problem, according to professor of pediatrics Barton D. Schmitt, is \"as parents we tend to suspect that our children\u2019s brains may melt.\" As a result of these misconceptions parents are anxious, give the child fever-reducing medicine when the temperature is technically normal or only slightly elevated, and interfere with the child's sleep to give the child more medicine.\nOther species.\nFever is an important feature for the &lt;a href=\"medical%20diagnosis\"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"livestock%20disease\"&gt;disease in domestic animals&lt;/a&gt;. The body temperature of animals, which is taken rectally, is different from one species to another. For example, a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; is said to have a fever above (). In species that allow the body to have a wide range of \"normal\" temperatures, such as &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;s, whose body temperature varies as the environmental temperature varies, the body temperature which constitutes a febrile state differs depending on the environmental temperature. Fever can also be behaviorally induced by invertebrates that do not have immune-system based fever. For instance, some species of grasshopper will thermoregulate to achieve body temperatures that are 2\u20135\u00a0\u00b0C higher than normal in order to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens such as \"&lt;a href=\"Beauveria%20bassiana\"&gt;Beauveria bassiana&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Metarhizium%20acridum\"&gt;Metarhizium acridum&lt;/a&gt;\". Honeybee colonies are also able to induce a fever in response to a fungal parasite \"Ascosphaera apis\"."
