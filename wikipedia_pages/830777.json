    "text": "Jeunesse Esch (full name Association Sportive la Jeunesse d'Esch/Alzette) is a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club, based in &lt;a href=\"Esch-sur-Alzette\"&gt;Esch-sur-Alzette&lt;/a&gt;, in south-western &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg\"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;. The side play in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Division%20%28Luxembourg%29\"&gt;National Division&lt;/a&gt;, the highest league in the country, and have won the league title on 28 occasions between 1921 and 2010, the most of any team in Luxembourg.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1907 as Jeunesse la Fronti\u00e8re d'Esch in reference to the proximity of their stadium to the &lt;a href=\"border\"&gt;border&lt;/a&gt; with France. \"La fronti\u00e8re\" was dropped to give the club its current name in 1918, which it retained until World War II, where the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; regime implemented the German name SV Schwarz-Wei\u00df 07 Esch and the club had to play in the \"&lt;a href=\"Gauliga%20Moselland\"&gt;Gauliga Moselland&lt;/a&gt;\", finishing runners-up in the 1943\u201344 season. After the liberation of Luxembourg, the name reverted to AS la Jeunesse d'Esch.\nHistorically, Jeunesse Esch has been the most successful side in Luxembourgish football. They have won the &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg%20National%20Division\"&gt;National Division&lt;/a&gt; on 28 occasions: first in 1921, and most recently in 2010. This is a national record, unless Racing FC Union Luxembourg's many predecessor clubs are counted together (they won a total of 28, divided between six incarnations). Jeunesse has also won the &lt;a href=\"Luxembourg%20Cup\"&gt;Luxembourg Cup&lt;/a&gt; on twelve occasions, second behind the fourteen won by &lt;a href=\"FA%20Red%20Boys%20Differdange\"&gt;FA Red Boys Differdange&lt;/a&gt; (now a part of &lt;a href=\"FC%20Differdange%2003\"&gt;FC Differdange 03&lt;/a&gt;). In total, they have completed the coveted &lt;a href=\"The%20Double%20%28Luxembourg%29\"&gt;Double&lt;/a&gt; on eight occasions.\nThey first entered the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt; in 1958, but like most of Luxembourg's clubs, failed to pass the preliminary rounds of the competition. Their most famous result came in the early stages of the 1973 competition when they held then-UEFA Cup holders &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; to a 1\u20131 draw at home before losing the second leg 2\u20130 at &lt;a href=\"Anfield\"&gt;Anfield&lt;/a&gt;.\nJeunesse have continued their success into recent times, being one of the top three Luxembourgish clubs, along with &lt;a href=\"F91%20Dudelange\"&gt;F91 Dudelange&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Etzella%20Ettelbruck\"&gt;FC Etzella Ettelbruck&lt;/a&gt;, of the past few years. However, the club had a disastrous &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20Luxembourg%20National%20Division\"&gt;2006\u201307 season&lt;/a&gt;, in which the club finished ninth, and only just avoided a relegation play-offs.\nEuropean competition.\nJeunesse Esch has qualified for &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; European competition thirty three times.\nJeunesse Esch is the only club from Luxembourg to have reached the second round of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;European Cup&lt;/a&gt;, and it has achieved that feat on two occasions, both under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"George%20Berry%20%28football%20manager%29\"&gt;George Berry&lt;/a&gt; in the early years of the competition:\nOverall, Jeunesse's record in European competition reads:"
