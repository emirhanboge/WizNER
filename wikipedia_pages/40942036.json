The Reds sent him on a minor league rehab assignment at the end of July, but a reoccurrence of the tendinitis ended the rehab stint. His UCL had recovered.

The last Reds pitcher to hit a grand slam was &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Purkey\"&gt;Bob Purkey&lt;/a&gt;, also against the Cubs, in 1959. DeSclafani was the starting pitcher and earned the win as the Reds defeated the Cubs 11\u20132. He completed the remainder of the season, starting 21 games, posting a 7\u20138 record with a 4.93 ERA in 115 innings.\nIn 2019, Desclafani played a full season, pitching third in the Reds' starting rotation behind &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Castillo%20%28pitcher%29\"&gt;Luis Castillo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sonny%20Gray\"&gt;Sonny Gray&lt;/a&gt;. He started 31 games, with a 9\u20139 record and a 3.89 ERA in 166.2 innings in which he struck out 167 batters while walking 49.\nOn July 23, 2020, one day into the quarantine-shortened season, the Reds placed Desclafani on the 10-day injured list with a strained back muscle. He was activated August 2, making his first start of the season that afternoon. In the shortened 2020 season, in 33.2 innings he was 1\u20132 with a 7.22 ERA.\nSan Francisco Giants (2021\u2013present).\nOn December 16, 2020, the &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Giants\"&gt;San Francisco Giants&lt;/a&gt; signed DeSclafani to a one-year $6 million contract.
