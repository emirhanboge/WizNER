    "text": "The String Quartet in C minor, &lt;a href=\"opus%20number\"&gt;Op.&lt;/a&gt; 35, was begun by &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Chausson\"&gt;Ernest Chausson&lt;/a&gt; in 1898 and the composer had fully scored all but part of the third and last &lt;a href=\"movement%20%28music%29\"&gt;movement&lt;/a&gt; before he died in a bicycle accident on 10\u00a0June 1899.
