Hunter-Reay struggled to qualify for the race and on Bump Day at 5:52\u00a0p.m. Hunter-Reay was bumped from the field by &lt;a href=\"John%20Andretti\"&gt;John Andretti&lt;/a&gt;. Hunter-Reay was able to requalify, bumping &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Tagliani\"&gt;Alex Tagliani&lt;/a&gt; by 0.0324 seconds. Hunter-Reay started 32nd after Tagliani replaced teammate &lt;a href=\"Bruno%20Junqueira\"&gt;Bruno Junqueira&lt;/a&gt; in his qualified car. In the race Hunter-Reay spun in turn 4 on lap 20 and crashed, resulting in a 32nd-place finish. Following the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Bombardier%20Learjet%20550\"&gt;Bombardier Learjet 550&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Texas Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay and Vision parted ways. Hunter-Reay was then announced as the replacement for &lt;a href=\"V%C3%ADtor%20Meira\"&gt;V\u00edtor Meira&lt;/a&gt;, who was injured while racing at Indianapolis, in the #14 &lt;a href=\"ABC%20Supply%20Company\"&gt;ABC Supply Company&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dallara\"&gt;Dallara IR07&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Ilmor%20Engineering\"&gt;Ilmor&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Honda%20Indy%20V8\"&gt;Indy V8 HI7R&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"A.J.%20Foyt%20Enterprises\"&gt;A.J. Foyt Enterprises&lt;/a&gt;. In his debut for the team at the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Iowa%20Corn%20Indy%20250\"&gt;Iowa Corn Indy 250&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20Speedway\"&gt;Iowa Speedway&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay only completed 2 laps due to a crash. Hunter-Reay would only get two top 10s for Foyt with a 7th at the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Honda%20Indy%20Toronto\"&gt;Honda Indy Toronto&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20Place\"&gt;Exhibition Place&lt;/a&gt; and a 4th at the &lt;a href=\"2009%20Honda%20200\"&gt;Honda Indy 200&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mid-Ohio%20Sports%20Car%20Course\"&gt;Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course&lt;/a&gt;. Hunter-Reay's only top 10 start of the season for either Vision or Foyt was a 7th at Mid-Ohio. Hunter-Reay would finish 15th in points with 298 points. Hunter-Reay was 10th in points following his split from Vision.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2010%20IndyCar%20Series%20season\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay began to drive for &lt;a href=\"Andretti%20Autosport\"&gt;Andretti Autosport&lt;/a&gt; in a part-time schedule that would consist of all races through the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt;. Hunter-Reay would drive the #37 &lt;a href=\"Izod\"&gt;Izod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dallara\"&gt;Dallara IR07&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Ilmor%20Engineering\"&gt;Ilmor&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Honda%20Indy%20V8\"&gt;Indy V8 HI7R&lt;/a&gt;. At the season-opening &lt;a href=\"2010%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Indy%20300\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo Indy 300&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Indy%20300\"&gt;Streets of S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay started 4th and would lead for 20 laps, only to be passed by &lt;a href=\"Will%20Power\"&gt;Will Power&lt;/a&gt; on lap 58 of 61. Three races later at the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Toyota%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20Long%20Beach\"&gt;Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20of%20Long%20Beach\"&gt;Streets of Long Beach&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay started 2nd, set the fastest race lap and led for 64 of 85 laps to win the race. Following the race Hunter-Reay was ranked 3rd in points. At the next race, the &lt;a href=\"2010%20RoadRunner%20Turbo%20Indy%20300\"&gt;RoadRunner Turbo Indy 300&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kansas%20Speedway\"&gt;Kansas Speedway&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay started 22nd and finished 5th. At the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay qualified in a disappointing 17th place. In the race Hunter-Reay was on his way to a top 10 finish when on lap 199 in turn 3 he ran out of fuel causing &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Conway\"&gt;Mike Conway&lt;/a&gt; to drive over the left side of Hunter-Reay's car and flip into the catchfence. At the same time Hunter-Reay lost control and drove into the wall. Hunter-Reay would finish in 18th place. Following the race Hunter-Reay was 5th in points and was given additional races. The team would race with additional sponsorship from &lt;a href=\"American%20Ethanol\"&gt;Ethanol&lt;/a&gt; at select races. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Camping%20World%20Grand%20Prix%20at%20The%20Glen\"&gt;Camping World Grand Prix at The Glen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Watkins%20Glen%20International\"&gt;Watkins Glen International&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay was announced as a driver for all the remaining races. Hunter-Reay's best finish following Indianapolis was a 3rd at the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Honda%20Indy%20Toronto\"&gt;Honda Indy Toronto&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20Place\"&gt;Exhibition Place&lt;/a&gt;. Hunter-Reay would finish 7th in the final point standings with 445 points.\n2011-2014.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2011%20IndyCar%20Series%20season\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay returned with &lt;a href=\"Andretti%20Autosport\"&gt;Andretti Autosport&lt;/a&gt; to drive the #28 &lt;a href=\"DHL%20Express\"&gt;DHL&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Sun%20Drop\"&gt;Sun Drop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dallara\"&gt;Dallara IR07&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Ilmor%20Engineering\"&gt;Ilmor&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Honda%20Indy%20V8\"&gt;Indy V8 HI7R&lt;/a&gt;. At the first two races of the season, the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Honda%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20of%20St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;Streets of St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Indy%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20Alabama\"&gt;Honda Indy Grand Prix of Alabama&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Barber%20Motorsports%20Park\"&gt;Barber Motorsports Park&lt;/a&gt;. In these races Hunter-Reay finished 21st (retired due to handling) and 14th in the races. At the third race of the season, the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Toyota%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20Long%20Beach\"&gt;2011 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20of%20Long%20Beach\"&gt;Streets of Long Beach&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay started 2nd and led for 2 laps. Hunter-Reay was on his way to a respectable finish when he suffered gearbox problems. Hunter-Reays's teammate &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Conway\"&gt;Mike Conway&lt;/a&gt; would win the race while Hunter-Reay finished 23rd. At the following race, the &lt;a href=\"2011%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Indy%20300\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo Indy 300&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Indy%20300\"&gt;Streets of S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay started in 2nd place. At the start of the race Hunter-Reay's steering failed and as a result Hunter-Reay drove straight into a sign along the track. The team made repairs to the car while the race was stopped for rain. Hunter-Reay would finish 18th, five laps down, due to the repairs and the crash. At the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt; the Andretti team struggled in practice. On Bump Day Hunter-Reay was bumped from the field by teammate &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Andretti\"&gt;Marco Andretti&lt;/a&gt; with 55 seconds left in qualifying. Andretti later made a deal with &lt;a href=\"A.J.%20Foyt%20Enterprises\"&gt;A.J. Foyt Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; for Hunter-Reay to replace &lt;a href=\"Bruno%20Junqueira\"&gt;Bruno Junqueira&lt;/a&gt; in his already-qualified car. Hunter-Reay would drive the #41 &lt;a href=\"ABC%20Supply%20Company\"&gt;ABC Supply Company&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"DHL%20Express\"&gt;DHL&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Sun%20Drop\"&gt;Sun Drop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dallara\"&gt;Dallara IR07&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Ilmor%20Engineering\"&gt;Ilmor&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Honda%20Indy%20V8\"&gt;Indy V8 HI7R&lt;/a&gt;. In the race Hunter-Reay started 33rd and finished 23rd, three laps down. Following Indianapolis Hunter-Reay would gain additional sponsorships at various races from &lt;a href=\"Snapple\"&gt;Snapple&lt;/a&gt; (both Texas races), &lt;a href=\"GoDaddy.com\"&gt;GoDaddy.com&lt;/a&gt; (Milwaukee, without DHL or Sun Drop) and &lt;a href=\"Circle%20K\"&gt;Circle K&lt;/a&gt; (all other races following Indianapolis). Hunter-Reay would get his first top 10 of the season at the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Firestone%20Twin%20275s\"&gt;Firestone Twin 275s Race #2&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Texas Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt; with a 9th-place finish after starting 5th in a race that had its starting lineup determined by a random draw. At the following race, the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Milwaukee%20225\"&gt;Milwaukee 225&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Mile\"&gt;Milwaukee Mile&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay started 7th and crashed on the first lap, finishing in 26th (last) place. Hunter-Reay then started and finished 8th at the following race, the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Iowa%20Corn%20Indy%20250\"&gt;Iowa Corn Indy 250&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20Speedway\"&gt;Iowa Speedway&lt;/a&gt;. At the following race of the season, the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Honda%20Indy%20Toronto\"&gt;Honda Indy Toronto&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20Place\"&gt;Exhibition Place&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay started 8th and finished 3rd to get his first podium of the year. Hunter-Reay would then start and finish 7th at the next race, the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Edmonton%20Indy\"&gt;Edmonton Indy&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Edmonton%20City%20Centre%20Airport\"&gt;Edmonton City Centre Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Hunter-Reay then got another podium at the following race, the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Honda%20Indy%20200\"&gt;Honda Indy 200&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mid-Ohio%20Sports%20Car%20Course\"&gt;Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course&lt;/a&gt; with a 3rd after starting 5th. At the following race, the &lt;a href=\"2011%20MoveThatBlock.com%20Indy%20225\"&gt;MoveThatBlock.com Indy 225&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"New%20Hampshire%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;New Hampshire Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay started 5th and led for 71 laps. Hunter-Reay inherited the lead when several other drivers who had led the race, such as &lt;a href=\"Dario%20Franchitti\"&gt;Dario Franchitti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Takuma%20Sato\"&gt;Takuma Sato&lt;/a&gt;, were involved in crashes. Rain came in the late stages of the race. On lap 220 of 225 Hunter-Reay was leading &lt;a href=\"Oriol%20Servi%C3%A0\"&gt;Oriol Servi\u00e0&lt;/a&gt; when the race was restarted and almost immediately teammate &lt;a href=\"Danica%20Patrick\"&gt;Danica Patrick&lt;/a&gt; spun due to the rain and collected several cars making the race go back to a caution. During this time Servi\u00e0 took the lead. &lt;a href=\"INDYCAR\"&gt;INDYCAR&lt;/a&gt; officials decided to revert the results to lap 215 when the race was under caution for the rain. Hunter-Reay's best finish following the New Hampshire race was a 5th at the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Kentucky%20Indy%20300\"&gt;Kentucky Indy 300&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Speedway\"&gt;Kentucky Speedway&lt;/a&gt;. At the season-ending &lt;a href=\"2011%20IZOD%20IndyCar%20World%20Championship\"&gt;2011 Izod IndyCar World Championship&lt;/a&gt; at Las Vegas Motor Speedway Hunter-Reay and &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Tagliani\"&gt;Alex Tagliani&lt;/a&gt; made light contact while racing each other early in the race. On lap 11 &lt;a href=\"James%20Hinchcliffe\"&gt;James Hinchcliffe&lt;/a&gt; was clipped by &lt;a href=\"Wade%20Cunningham\"&gt;Wade Cunningham&lt;/a&gt;. Cunningham and &lt;a href=\"J.%20R.%20Hildebrand\"&gt;J. R. Hildebrand&lt;/a&gt; then made contact when Cunningham swerved and Hildebrand drove over the rear of his car. Hildebrand's car became airborne and Cunningham collected &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Howard\"&gt;Jay Howard&lt;/a&gt; on the inside and then &lt;a href=\"Townsend%20Bell\"&gt;Townsend Bell&lt;/a&gt; on the outside before crashing into the wall. Attempting to avoid the crash ahead, &lt;a href=\"V%C3%ADtor%20Meira\"&gt;V\u00edtor Meira&lt;/a&gt; lost control, spinning inward collecting both &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Kimball\"&gt;Charlie Kimball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"E.%20J.%20Viso\"&gt;E. J. Viso&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time Meira lost control, &lt;a href=\"Tomas%20Scheckter\"&gt;Tomas Scheckter&lt;/a&gt; was also attempting to avoid the first crash by rapidly slowing down on the outside. This led to &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Tracy\"&gt;Paul Tracy&lt;/a&gt; crashing into the back of Scheckter and a rapidly approaching &lt;a href=\"Pippa%20Mann\"&gt;Pippa Mann&lt;/a&gt; to launch over the top of Tracy after jerking to the outside to avoid crashing into &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Lloyd\"&gt;Alex Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Wheldon\"&gt;Dan Wheldon&lt;/a&gt; (who was attempting to win $5 million to split evenly with a fan courtesy of series sponsors &lt;a href=\"Verizon%20Wireless\"&gt;Verizon Wireless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"GoDaddy.com\"&gt;GoDaddy.com&lt;/a&gt;) had moved from 34th (last) place (due to the contest) to 24th when the crash occurred. Wheldon could only slow down from about 220 miles per hour to about 180 miles per hour. Wheldon would drive over Kimball's car and flip towards the catchfence and would hit one of the track's fence posts. Wheldon was pronounced dead on arrival of &lt;a href=\"Blunt%20trauma\"&gt;blunt force trauma&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"University%20Medical%20Center%20of%20Southern%20Nevada\"&gt;University Medical Center of Southern Nevada&lt;/a&gt; at 1:54\u00a0p.m. &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;Pacific Daylight Time&lt;/a&gt;. The remainder of the race was cancelled and removed from the record books. It was later revealed that Wheldon had signed with Andretti the morning of the race (Wheldon drove for the team from &lt;a href=\"2003%20IndyCar%20Series%20season\"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"2005%20IndyCar%20Series%20season\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt; and during that time he won the &lt;a href=\"2005%20Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt; and the series championship in 2005). Hunter-Reay would finish 7th in points with 347 points.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2012%20IndyCar%20Series%20season\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay returned to drive for &lt;a href=\"Andretti%20Autosport\"&gt;Andretti Autosport&lt;/a&gt; in the #28 &lt;a href=\"DHL%20Express\"&gt;DHL&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Sun%20Drop\"&gt;Sun Drop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dallara\"&gt;Dallara&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dallara%20DW12\"&gt;DW12&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Ilmor%20Engineering\"&gt;Ilmor&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Chevrolet\"&gt;Chevrolet Indy V6&lt;/a&gt; (the DW12 was named after &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Wheldon\"&gt;Dan Wheldon&lt;/a&gt;, who had tested the car at both &lt;a href=\"Mid-Ohio%20Sports%20Car%20Course\"&gt;Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Indianapolis Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt; when it was called the &lt;a href=\"Dallara%20DW12\"&gt;Dallara IR12&lt;/a&gt;), with additional sponsorship from &lt;a href=\"Circle%20K\"&gt;Circle K&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Casey%27s%20General%20Stores\"&gt;Casey's General Stores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Pepper\"&gt;Dr. Pepper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelotonia\"&gt;Pelotonia&lt;/a&gt;. At the season-opening &lt;a href=\"2012%20Honda%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20of%20St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;Streets of St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay started and finished 3rd. Hunter-Reay then finished 2nd three races later at the &lt;a href=\"2012%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Indy%20300\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo Indy 300&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Indy%20300\"&gt;Streets of S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Indianapolis%20500\"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay qualified in a career-best (as of 2014 Indianapolis 500) third place. In the race Hunter-Reay ran consistently in the top 10 until he had to retire after 123 laps due to a suspension problem. Hunter-Reay then started 6th and finished 7th at the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Chevrolet%20Detroit%20Belle%20Isle%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Belle%20Isle%20State%20Park%20%28Michigan%29\"&gt;Belle Isle State Park&lt;/a&gt; and started 13th and finished 21st due fuel injector problems at the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Firestone%20550\"&gt;Firestone 550&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Texas Motor Speedway&lt;/a&gt;. Hunter-Reay then won three consecutive races with the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Milwaukee%20IndyFest\"&gt;Milwaukee IndyFest&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Milwaukee%20Mile\"&gt;Milwaukee Mile&lt;/a&gt; (a race that was, and still is, promoted by Hunter-Reay's team owner &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Andretti\"&gt;Michael Andretti&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Iowa%20Corn%20Indy%20250\"&gt;Iowa Corn Indy 250&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Iowa%20Speedway\"&gt;Iowa Speedway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Honda%20Indy%20Toronto\"&gt;Honda Indy Toronto&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Exhibition%20Place\"&gt;Exhibition Place&lt;/a&gt;. Following the Toronto race Hunter-Reay took the points lead. Hunter-Reay lost the points lead following the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Honda%20Indy%20200%20at%20Mid-Ohio\"&gt;Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mid-Ohio%20Sports%20Car%20Course\"&gt;Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course&lt;/a&gt;, where he started 7th and finished 24th out of 25 cars due to an engine problem after 79 of 85 laps. At the following race, the &lt;a href=\"2012%20GoPro%20Indy%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20Sonoma\"&gt;GoPro Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sonoma%20Raceway\"&gt;Sonoma Raceway&lt;/a&gt;, Hunter-Reay started 7th and was running in the top 10 late in the race when on a restart &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Tagliani\"&gt;Alex Tagliani&lt;/a&gt; made contact with Hunter-Reay, causing Hunter-Reay to spin. Hunter-Reay would finish 18th, one lap down, while his main championship rival &lt;a href=\"Will%20Power\"&gt;Will Power&lt;/a&gt; finished 2nd. At the following race Hunter-Reay took the championship battle to the final race of the season after he won the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20Baltimore\"&gt;Grand Prix of Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20of%20Baltimore\"&gt;Streets of Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;. At the season-ending &lt;a href=\"2012%20MAVTV%20500%20IndyCar%20World%20Championships\"&gt;MAVTV 500 IndyCar World Championships&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Club%20Speedway\"&gt;Auto Club Speedway&lt;/a&gt; Hunter-Reay and Power both had to receive 10-grid spot penalties due to both of them exceeding their five-engine change limit. Hunter-Reay was also battling &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Kanaan\"&gt;Tony Kanaan&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"A.%20J.%20Foyt\"&gt;A. J. Foyt&lt;/a&gt; Oval Championship. In the race, Hunter-Reay and Power were both running mid-pack early in the race. On lap 56, Power spun in turn 2 when he was slightly ahead of Hunter-Reay. Hunter-Reay would avoid Power. With Power in 25th place, Hunter-Ready needed to finish 6th or better to win the championship. &lt;a href=\"Team%20Penske\"&gt;Team Penske&lt;/a&gt; later managed to repair Power's car (a rarity for open-wheel race cars) in order for Power to complete additional laps. Power was able to complete 66 laps to move up to 24th place. Hunter-Reay now had to finish in 5th place or better. Hunter-Reay gradually moved up through the field and into the top 5 to move into the championship lead. On lap 241, Kanaan crashed in turn 4 and the race was stopped. On the restart, Hunter-Reay managed to stay in the top 5. As the leaders started lap 250 (the final lap), Hunter-Reay was in turn 4 in 5th place when 4th place &lt;a href=\"Takuma%20Sato\"&gt;Takuma Sato&lt;/a&gt; spun and crashed. Hunter-Reay was able to avoid Sato just as &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Carpenter%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Ed Carpenter&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href=\"Dario%20Franchitti\"&gt;Dario Franchitti&lt;/a&gt; for the lead. Carpenter would win the race while Hunter-Reay finished 4th and won both the overall and the oval championships. Hunter-Reay became the first &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; to win the series championship since &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Hornish%2C%20Jr.\"&gt;Sam Hornish, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2006%20IndyCar%20Series%20season\"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;.
