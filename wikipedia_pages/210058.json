    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"linguistics\"&gt;linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, a modifier is an optional element in &lt;a href=\"phrase\"&gt;phrase&lt;/a&gt; structure or &lt;a href=\"clause\"&gt;clause&lt;/a&gt; structure which \"modifies\" the meaning of another element in the structure. For instance, the &lt;a href=\"adjective\"&gt;adjective&lt;/a&gt; \"red\" acts as a modifier in the &lt;a href=\"noun%20phrase\"&gt;noun phrase&lt;/a&gt; \"red ball\", providing extra detail about which particular ball is under discussion. Similarly, the &lt;a href=\"adverb\"&gt;adverb&lt;/a&gt; \"quickly\" acts as a modifier in the verb &lt;a href=\"phrase\"&gt;phrase&lt;/a&gt; \"run quickly\".\nPremodifiers and postmodifiers.\nModifiers may come either before or after the modified element (the \"&lt;a href=\"head%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;\"), depending on the type of modifier and the rules of &lt;a href=\"syntax\"&gt;syntax&lt;/a&gt; for the language in question. A modifier placed before the head is called a premodifier; one placed after the head is called a postmodifier.\nFor example, in \"land mines\", the word \"land\" is a premodifier of \"mines\", whereas in the phrase \"mines in wartime\", the phrase \"in wartime\" is a postmodifier of \"mines\". A head may have a number of modifiers, and these may include both premodifiers and postmodifiers. For example:\nIn this noun phrase, \"man\" is the head, \"nice\" and \"tall\" are premodifiers, and \"from Canada\" and \"whom you met\" are postmodifiers.\nNotice that in English, simple adjectives are usually used as premodifiers, with occasional exceptions such as \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Agalore\"&gt;galore&lt;/a&gt;\" (which always appears after the noun) or the adjectives \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Aimmemorial\"&gt;immemorial&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Amartial\"&gt;martial&lt;/a&gt;\" in the phrases \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Atime%20immemorial\"&gt;time immemorial&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"wikt%3Acourt%20martial\"&gt;court martial&lt;/a&gt;\" (the latter comes from &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, where most adjectives are postmodifiers). Sometimes placement of the adjective after the noun entails a change of meaning: compare \"a responsible person\" and \"the person responsible\", or \"the proper town\" (the appropriate town) and \"the town proper\" (the area of the town as properly defined).\nIt is possible in English for a modifier to be separated from its head by other modifiers, as in \"The man here whom you bumped into in the street yesterday\", where the relative clause \"who...yesterday\" is separated from the word it modifies (\"man\") by the modifier \"here\". In some other languages, words other than modifiers may occur in between, this type of situation is especially likely in languages with &lt;a href=\"free%20word%20order\"&gt;free word order&lt;/a&gt;, and often agreement between the grammatical gender or singularity/plurality of the modifier and its head is used to indicate the relationship. In English, modifiers may sometimes even be interposed between component words or syllables of the head, such as in &lt;a href=\"split%20infinitive\"&gt;split infinitive&lt;/a&gt;s (\"to boldly go\") or &lt;a href=\"infixation\"&gt;infixation&lt;/a&gt; (\"in-fucking-credible\").\nTypes.\nThe two principal types of modifiers are &lt;a href=\"adjective\"&gt;adjective&lt;/a&gt;s (and &lt;a href=\"adjectival%20phrase\"&gt;adjectival phrase&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"adjectival%20clause\"&gt;adjectival clause&lt;/a&gt;s), which modify nouns; and &lt;a href=\"adverb\"&gt;adverb&lt;/a&gt;s (and &lt;a href=\"adverbial%20phrase\"&gt;adverbial phrase&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"adverbial%20clause\"&gt;adverbial clause&lt;/a&gt;s), which modify other parts of speech, particularly verbs, adjectives and other adverbs, as well as whole phrases or clauses. (Not all adjectives and adverbs are necessarily modifiers, however; an adjective will normally be considered a modifier when used &lt;a href=\"attributive%20adjective\"&gt;attributively&lt;/a&gt;, but not when used predicatively \u2013 compare the examples with the adjective \"red\" at the start of this article.)\nAnother type of modifier in some languages, including English, is the &lt;a href=\"noun%20adjunct\"&gt;noun adjunct&lt;/a&gt;, which is a noun modifying another noun (or occasionally another part of speech). An example is \"land\" in the phrase \"land mines\" given above.\nExamples of the above types of modifiers, in English, are given below.\nIn some cases, noun phrases or &lt;a href=\"Quantifier%20%28linguistics%29\"&gt;quantifiers&lt;/a&gt; can act as modifiers:\nAmbiguous and dangling modifiers.\nSometimes it is not clear which element of the sentence a modifier is intended to modify. In many cases this is not important, but in some cases it can lead to genuine &lt;a href=\"ambiguity\"&gt;ambiguity&lt;/a&gt;. For example:\nHere the participial phrase \"sitting on the step\" may be intended to modify \"her\" (meaning that the painting's subject was sitting on the step), or it may be intended to modify the verb phrase \"painted her\" or the whole clause \"he painted her\" (or just \"he\"), meaning in effect that it was the painter who was sitting on the step.\nSometimes the element which the modifier is intended to modify does not in fact appear in the sentence, or is not in an appropriate position to be associated with that modifier. This is often considered a grammatical or stylistic error. For example:\nHere whoever was \"walking along the road\" is not mentioned in the sentence, so the modifier (\"walking along the road\") has nothing to modify, except \"a vulture\", which is clearly not the intention. Such a case is called a \"dangling modifier\", or more specifically, in the common case where (as here) the modifier is a participial phrase, a \"dangling participle\""
