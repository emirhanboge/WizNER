He played &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stanford%20Cardinal%20football\"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;. Montgomery was drafted as a &lt;a href=\"wide%20receiver\"&gt;wide receiver&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Bay%20Packers\"&gt;Green Bay Packers&lt;/a&gt; in the third round of the &lt;a href=\"2015%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;2015 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;. In 2016, he switched over to running back.\nEarly years.\nMontgomery attended &lt;a href=\"St.%20Mark%27s%20School%20of%20Texas\"&gt;St. Mark's School of Texas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dallas%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Dallas, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a five-sport star in football, track, basketball, baseball, and\nlacrosse. He played as a &lt;a href=\"wide%20receiver\"&gt;wide receiver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"running%20back\"&gt;running back&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"quarterback\"&gt;quarterback&lt;/a&gt; for the Lions &lt;a href=\"high%20school%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; team.

However, in a Week 6 game against the &lt;a href=\"2016%20Dallas%20Cowboys%20season\"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; he began seeing time in the backfield due to injuries to running backs &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Lacy\"&gt;Eddie Lacy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"James%20Starks\"&gt;James Starks&lt;/a&gt;. He finished the game with 10 receptions for 98 yards in the Packers' 30\u201316 loss. In the next game, Montgomery had another 10-catch performance and rushed for 60 yards on nine carries against the &lt;a href=\"Chicago%20Bears\"&gt;Chicago Bears&lt;/a&gt;.
