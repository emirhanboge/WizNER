    "text": "Sir Samuel Gillott (29 October 1838 \u2013 29 June 1913) was an Australian lawyer and politician, commonly known as a former &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;Lord Mayor of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nGillott was born in the city of &lt;a href=\"Sheffield\"&gt;Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;, then in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire\"&gt;West Riding of Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Joseph and Elizabeth Gillott. Educated in &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;Sheffield Grammar School&lt;/a&gt;, Gillott moved to &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, Australia at the age of 17, in 1856. He was employed by a law firm, Vaughan, Moule &amp; Seddon, and received his law degree from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Melbourne\"&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately after he started practicing law, Vaughan, Moule &amp; Seddon offered him a &lt;a href=\"partnership\"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt;. During the 1890s, Gillott specialized in &lt;a href=\"Magistrates%27%20court%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29\"&gt;police court&lt;/a&gt; practice, with a firm exception being the &lt;a href=\"David%20Syme%23Protectionism\"&gt;Speight v. Syme libel case&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitics.\nGillott was elected as Mayor of Melbourne in 1896, but lost his mayorship in 1899 by one vote. In November 1899, Gillott was elected to the seat of &lt;a href=\"Electoral%20district%20of%20East%20Melbourne\"&gt;East Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20Legislative%20Assembly\"&gt;Victorian Legislative Assembly&lt;/a&gt;; he held this seat until December 1906. He became President of the &lt;a href=\"Law%20Institute\"&gt;Law Institute&lt;/a&gt; in 1900. In the same year, Gillott was re-elected as the Mayor of Melbourne. Promoted to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mayor\"&gt;Lord Mayor&lt;/a&gt; in 1901, Gillott was &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Bachelor\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;ed in the same year during the visit to Australia of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later &lt;a href=\"George%20V\"&gt;King George V&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mary%20of%20Teck\"&gt;Queen Mary&lt;/a&gt;). In 1901, under the state ministry of Sir &lt;a href=\"George%20Turner%20%28Australian%20politician%29\"&gt;George Turner&lt;/a&gt;, Gillott was given the role of Honorary Minister. After the Turner Government's fall that year, he stayed on the ministry, becoming &lt;a href=\"Attorney%20General\"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;. In 1904, under the premiership of Sir &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Bent\"&gt;Thomas Bent&lt;/a&gt;, Gillott became the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Secretary%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Chief Secretary&lt;/a&gt; and the Minister for Labour.\nIn May 1906, controversy arose for Gillott when a &lt;a href=\"Demagogy\"&gt;demagogue reformer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Judkins\"&gt;William Judkins&lt;/a&gt;, held him responsible for &lt;a href=\"illegal%20gambling\"&gt;illegal gambling&lt;/a&gt;. As proof, Judkins named &lt;a href=\"John%20Wren\"&gt;John Wren&lt;/a&gt;'s illegal betting schemes, which he held as evidence of a corrupt government. As a result of the controversial issue, Thomas Bent agreed to prohibit off-course betting. Later that year, Gillott introduced the gaming suppression bill. Following the gambling controversy, &lt;a href=\"John%20Norton%20%28journalist%29\"&gt;John Norton&lt;/a&gt;'s newspaper, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Truth%20%28Sydney%20newspaper%29\"&gt;The Truth&lt;/a&gt;\", published an article on Gillott, linking him to a well known &lt;a href=\"brothel\"&gt;brothel&lt;/a&gt; proprietor, &lt;a href=\"Caroline%20Hodgson\"&gt;Caroline Hodgson&lt;/a&gt;, and revealing his financial dealings with her since 1877. Resigning from parliament and the ministry after these allegations, Gillott returned to England, where he stayed for almost a year.\nReturning to Australia after a year in England, he resumed his seat in the Melbourne City Council, and became president and councillor of the &lt;a href=\"RMIT%20University\"&gt;Working Men's College of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. On another visit to England in 1913, Gillott died after falling down a flight of stairs at night in Sheffield. He was 74 years of age. His body was returned to Australia and was interred at &lt;a href=\"Melbourne%20General%20Cemetery\"&gt;Melbourne General Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;."
