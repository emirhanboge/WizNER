    "text": "Avraham Taviv (, born 1889, died 20 April 1950) was an Israeli politician.\nBiography.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Yemen%20Vilayet\"&gt;Yemen Vilayet&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Taviv received a religious Jewish education, before working as a jeweler and repairing weapons. He made &lt;a href=\"aliyah\"&gt;aliyah&lt;/a&gt; to Ottoman-controlled Palestine in 1908 in the first caravan from Yemen. He joined &lt;a href=\"Hapoel%20Hatzair\"&gt;Hapoel Hatzair&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Ahdut%20HaAvoda\"&gt;Ahdut HaAvoda&lt;/a&gt;. In 1918 he was elected to &lt;a href=\"Rishon%20LeZion\"&gt;Rishon LeZion&lt;/a&gt;'s village council. An activist for Yemenite immigrants, he helped establish four Yemenite neighbourhoods in various cities and towns, and was the Yemenite settlements' representative on the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20Agency%20for%20Israel\"&gt;Jewish Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s Aliyah Committee.\nIn 1920 he attended the founding convention of the &lt;a href=\"Histadrut\"&gt;Histadrut&lt;/a&gt; trade union (and was later elected to its Agricultural Association), and in the same year he was elected to the first &lt;a href=\"Assembly%20of%20Representatives%20%28Mandate%20Palestine%29\"&gt;Assembly of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;. He served on the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20National%20Council\"&gt;Jewish National Council&lt;/a&gt; until 1931, and again from 1944 until 1948. In 1923 he established the &lt;a href=\"Yemenite%20Association\"&gt;Yemenite Association&lt;/a&gt;, which he led until his death. In 1945 he joined &lt;a href=\"Mapai\"&gt;Mapai&lt;/a&gt;, and was elected to the first Knesset on its list in &lt;a href=\"1949%20Israeli%20legislative%20election\"&gt;1949&lt;/a&gt;. He died on 20 April 1950, and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Yitzhak%20Kanav\"&gt;Yitzhak Kanav&lt;/a&gt;."
