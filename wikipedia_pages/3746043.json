    "text": " The Young\u2013Helmholtz theory (based on the work of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Young%20%28scientist%29\"&gt;Thomas Young&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20von%20Helmholtz\"&gt;Hermann von Helmholtz&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century), also known as the trichromatic theory, is a theory of &lt;a href=\"trichromacy\"&gt;trichromatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"color%20vision\"&gt;color vision&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the manner in which the &lt;a href=\"visual%20system\"&gt;visual system&lt;/a&gt; gives rise to the phenomenological experience of color. In 1802, Young postulated the existence of three types of photoreceptors (now known as &lt;a href=\"cone%20cell\"&gt;cone cell&lt;/a&gt;s) in the eye, with different but overlapping response to different wavelengths of visible light.\nHermann von Helmholtz developed the theory further in 1850: that the three types of cone photoreceptors could be classified as short-preferring (&lt;a href=\"violet%20%28color%29\"&gt;violet&lt;/a&gt;), middle-preferring (&lt;a href=\"green\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;), and long-preferring (&lt;a href=\"red\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;), according to their response to the wavelengths of light striking the &lt;a href=\"retina\"&gt;retina&lt;/a&gt;. The relative strengths of the signals detected by the three types of cones are interpreted by the &lt;a href=\"brain\"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; as a visible color.\nFor instance, yellow light uses different proportions of red and green, but little blue, so any hue depends on a mix of all three cones, for example, a strong red-sensitive, medium green-sensitive, and low blue-sensitive. Moreover, the intensity of colors can be changed without changing their hues, since intensity depends on the frequency of discharge to the brain, as a blue-green can be brightened but retain the same hue. The system is not perfect, as it does not distinguish yellow from a red-green mixture, but can powerfully detect subtle environmental changes.\nIn 1857, &lt;a href=\"James%20Clerk%20Maxwell\"&gt;James Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; used the recently developed &lt;a href=\"linear%20algebra\"&gt;linear algebra&lt;/a&gt; to prove Young\u2013Helmholtz's theory.\nThe existence of cells sensitive to three different wavelength ranges (most sensitive to yellowish green, cyanish-green, and blue \u2013 not red, green and blue) was first shown in 1956 by &lt;a href=\"Gunnar%20Svaetichin%20%28scientist%29\"&gt;Gunnar Svaetichin&lt;/a&gt;. In 1983 it was validated in human retinas in an experiment by Dartnall, Bowmaker, and Mollon, who obtained microspectrophotopic readings of single eye cone cells. Earlier evidence for the theory had been obtained by looking at light reflected from the retinas of living humans, and absorption of light by retinal cells removed from corpses."
