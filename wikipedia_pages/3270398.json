    "text": "The Association of Pizza Delivery Drivers (APDD) was a &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trade%20union\"&gt;labor union&lt;/a&gt; representing &lt;a href=\"Pizza%20delivery\"&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt; and other ready-to-eat food drivers. This union had nearly 1,000 members across 46 states. The APDD was unique in that it was one of the first unions to be all electronic, operating exclusively over the &lt;a href=\"internet\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;. This union was funded entirely by &lt;a href=\"donation\"&gt;donation&lt;/a&gt;s, rather than dues.\nRelated to one of APDD's certification elections, the &lt;a href=\"National%20Labor%20Relations%20Board\"&gt;National Labor Relations Board&lt;/a&gt; ruled in October 2004 that delivery drivers may be considered for organization separately from employees in the rest of the pizza store. This was decided on the basis that delivery drivers have vastly different responsibilities and duties than employees in the rest of the store.\nAPDD sought to increase &lt;a href=\"wages\"&gt;wages&lt;/a&gt; for delivery drivers, mileage re-imbursement, and to enhance safety procedures related to delivery."
