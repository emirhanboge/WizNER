    "text": "The 2004\u201305 National Division Two was the fifth version (eighteenth overall) of the &lt;a href=\"National%20League%201\"&gt;third division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; league system using the name National Division Two. New teams to the division included &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; who were relegated from the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20National%20Division%20One\"&gt;2003\u201304 National Division One&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Waterloo%20FC\"&gt;Waterloo&lt;/a&gt; came up as champions of the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20National%20Division%20Three%20North\"&gt;2003\u201304 National Division Three North&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Blackheath%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackheath&lt;/a&gt; (champions) and &lt;a href=\"Launceston%20Rugby%20Club\"&gt;Launceston&lt;/a&gt; (playoffs) coming up from the &lt;a href=\"2003%E2%80%9304%20National%20Division%20Three%20South\"&gt;2003\u201304 National Division Three South&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wakefield%20R.F.C.\"&gt;Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; had also been supposed to join the division having finished 13th in National Division One but sadly due to financial difficulties the club would go into liquidation and cease to exist. This season would see the league points system being overhauled in the division with four points being awarded for a win, two points for a draw as well as bonus points being introduced (the Premiership had been using them since 2000) with teams being awarded an extra point for scoring four or more tries during a game or if losing, being within seven points of the victor.\n&lt;a href=\"Doncaster%20R.F.C.\"&gt;Doncaster&lt;/a&gt; would finish as league champions, 13 points clear of nearest rivals, &lt;a href=\"Newbury%20R.F.C.\"&gt;Newbury Blues&lt;/a&gt;. Both sides would go up to the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20National%20Division%20One\"&gt;2005\u201306 National Division One&lt;/a&gt;. At the other end of the table, apart from &lt;a href=\"Rosslyn%20Park%20F.C.\"&gt;Rosslyn Park&lt;/a&gt; who were comfortably bottom, it was a very tight relegation battle with &lt;a href=\"Bracknell%20RFC\"&gt;Bracknell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nuneaton%20R.F.C.\"&gt;Nuneaton&lt;/a&gt; eventually going down to join Rosslyn Park despite both sides winning their last games - in the end only 2 points separated 10th placed &lt;a href=\"Esher%20RFC\"&gt;Esher&lt;/a&gt; from 12th placed Nuneaton. Nuneaton would drop down to the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20National%20Division%20Three%20North\"&gt;2005\u201306 National Division Three North&lt;/a&gt; while Bracknell and Rosslyn Park went into the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20National%20Division%20Three%20South\"&gt;2005\u201306 National Division Three South&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeason records.\nTeam.\n79 - 5 Harrogate at home to Bracknell on 27 November 2004\n57 - 12 Doncaster away to Wharfedale on 20 4 September 2004\n79 - 5 Harrogate at home to Bracknell on 27 November 2004\nHarrogate at home to Bracknell on 27 November 2004\nHarrogate at home to Bracknell on 27 November 2004\nBlackheath away to Stourbridge on 26 February 2005\nN/A - multiple teams\nPlayer.\n &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Davies%20%28Wharfedale%20Rugby%29\"&gt;Jonathan Davies&lt;/a&gt; for Wharfedale at home to Nuneaton on 9 October 2004\nN/A - multiple players\n &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Cholewa\"&gt;Lee Cholewa&lt;/a&gt; for Harrogate at home to Bracknell on 27 November 2004\n &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20McCashin\"&gt;Stephen McCashin&lt;/a&gt; for Blackheath away to Stourbridge on 26 February 2005\nN/A - multiple players\nAttendances.\nDoncaster at home to Manchester on 9 October 2004\nNuneaton at home to Bracknell on 23 October 2004 and Waterloo on 13 November 2004&lt;br&gt;\nBracknell at home to Esher on 20 November 2004\nDoncaster\nBracknell"
