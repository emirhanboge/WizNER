    "title": "Adidas Finale",
    "text": "The Adidas Finale is a brand of &lt;a href=\"ball%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;a href=\"Adidas\"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt;. It is the current official football of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA\"&gt;UEFA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Women%27s%20Champions%20League\"&gt;Women's Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Youth%20League\"&gt;Youth League&lt;/a&gt;; after Adidas took over the contract of official supplier from &lt;a href=\"Nike%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. The internal and external design of the ball changes reflecting improvements to football technologies taken from other Adidas-produced footballs. The external design is the \"Starball\" based on the stars of the UEFA Champions League logo. Each year's ball keeps the branding name of \"Adidas Finale\", excepting &lt;a href=\"suffix\"&gt;suffix&lt;/a&gt;es to designate the year.\nUsage.\nDuring its introduction the Adidas Finale was only used in the latter stages of Champions League competition; it was not uncommon to see other balls in the early rounds, usually provided by the kit manufacturer or the ball supplier for the domestic league of the home team, including other Adidas balls. However, from 2006\u201307, the Adidas Finale had been used in all stages of the competition, including the play-off round which was introduced in 2009\u201310 followed with the group stages. The balls can also be seen in other UEFA competitions. These balls are also occasionally used in the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Women%27s%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Women's Champions League&lt;/a&gt; with similar graphics.\nConstruction.\nThe ball is made by &lt;a href=\"Adidas\"&gt;Adidas&lt;/a&gt; as the German brand took over the contract from &lt;a href=\"Nike%2C%20Inc.\"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt; in 2000, and was firstly developed based on the Adidas Terrestra Silverstream, the official &lt;a href=\"match%20ball\"&gt;match ball&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202000\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2000&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. This ball was also made with the same type of materials and construction used for the &lt;a href=\"Adidas%20Fevernova\"&gt;Adidas Fevernova&lt;/a&gt;, except, of course, the graphics.\nThe Finale ball incorporates a unique design that was inspired by the UEFA Champions League \"starball\" logo. The Finale is softer, faster, and more accurate than any other Adidas football before and it also features a layer of highly compressed, gas-filled micro-balloons of equal size (syntactic foam), proven during Euro 2000 and probably contributing to one of the highest average goal rates in a major tournament.\nUntil the final of the 2005\u201306 season, the Finale used the traditional &lt;a href=\"truncated%20icosahedron\"&gt;truncated icosahedron&lt;/a&gt; panel design for their balls. From then on the panels are the same as the &lt;a href=\"Adidas%20Teamgeist\"&gt;Adidas Teamgeist&lt;/a&gt; ball. From 2004\u201305, the ball structure was the same as the &lt;a href=\"Adidas%20Roteiro\"&gt;Adidas Roteiro&lt;/a&gt; balls used for &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Euro%202004\"&gt;UEFA Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt;, which had thermally bonded panels.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"2010%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final\"&gt;2010 final&lt;/a&gt;, the panels took the shape of the competition's starball logo. The panels design has been revised in 2019, previously connected on the edges, the panels are now overlap to improve durability.\nDesign.\nEach season in the Champions League, the colour of the stars on the ball is changed. The first ball, in 2000\u201301 was silver, followed by black in 2001\u201302, then dark blue in 2003\u201304, and red in 2004\u201305. This was followed by light blue in 2005\u201306. The design for next season's ball was used in this season's final. A light blue ball was used for most of the 2005\u201306 season, but in the final between &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FC%20Barcelona\"&gt;FC Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, held in the &lt;a href=\"Stade%20de%20France\"&gt;Stade de France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; it was replaced by a ball with the same paneling as the &lt;a href=\"Adidas%20Teamgeist\"&gt;Adidas +Teamgeist&lt;/a&gt; but decorated with pink stars. For the 2006\u201307 season, the ball had grey stars trimmed in red and white and the Finale &lt;a href=\"Athens\"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; ball is a chrome silver metallic with royal blue and white. For the 2007\u201308 season, the ball was decorated in tangerine orange and black stars with grey trim. For the final of the 2007\u201308 season in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, the ball was gray and red stars with a gold trim, while the ball's paneling was still same with +Teamgeist, but with PSC-Texture which based on &lt;a href=\"Adidas%20Europass\"&gt;Adidas Europass&lt;/a&gt;. The match ball used for the 2008\u201309 season was black and white with a green trim. For 2009\u201310, the starball's based panels was being used.\nChampions League final variants.\nEach match ball intended for use in the final is marked with the location at which the final match is to be played. For example, the 2004\u201305 Champions League final was held in &lt;a href=\"Istanbul\"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; and as such, the blue/silver-starred Finale balls were marked with Istanbul.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2006\u201307&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2010\u201311&lt;/a&gt;, the Champions League holder played with the match ball used in the previous final in their home games. Since &lt;a href=\"2011-12%20UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;2011\u201312&lt;/a&gt;, the final ball has been used from the round of 16, with the title holders using the regular ball in their home group stage games.\nCollectors' items.\nThese official match balls are well prized. The UEFA Champions League is thought to be the most prestigious club competition and the ball itself has a very unusual design which makes the ball unique, &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; Approved with highest rating, and fairly cherishable."
