The season will begin on March 12 at the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Prix%20of%20St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;Grand Prix of St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; and end on September 11 at &lt;a href=\"Monterey%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;Monterey Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Patricio%20O%27Ward\"&gt;Patricio O'Ward&lt;/a&gt; dominated the first half of the season, winning six of the first seven races (and finishing second in the remaining race), vaulting himself into a huge points lead. However, his &lt;a href=\"Team%20Pelfrey\"&gt;Team Pelfrey&lt;/a&gt; teammate &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Telitz\"&gt;Aaron Telitz&lt;/a&gt; vaulted himself back into contention by winning the next four races while O'Ward faltered. Both drivers won one of the three races during the final race weekend but Telitz's non-winning finishes were higher and he won the championship by 28 points. Reigning &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20F2000%20National%20Championship\"&gt;U.S. F2000 National Championship&lt;/a&gt; champion &lt;a href=\"Nico%20Jamin\"&gt;Nico Jamin&lt;/a&gt; swept the weekend at the &lt;a href=\"Mid-Ohio%20Sports%20Car%20Course\"&gt;Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course&lt;/a&gt; and finished third in the championship, well back. The only other driver to win a race was Argentinean &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20Dapero\"&gt;Nicolas Dapero&lt;/a&gt; who captured his maiden victory in the penultimate race of the season and finished fifth in points, behind &lt;a href=\"Will%20Owen%20%28racing%20driver%29\"&gt;Will Owen&lt;/a&gt; who finished on the podium in eight of the sixteen races but failed to win.\nAmerican &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Eberle\"&gt;Bobby Eberle&lt;/a&gt; won the National Class championship, largely uncontested.\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"2016%20IndyCar%20Series%20season\"&gt;2016 IndyCar Series season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"2016%20Indy%20Lights%20season\"&gt;2016 Indy Lights season&lt;/a&gt;"
