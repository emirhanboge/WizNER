It is part of what &lt;a href=\"tarot%20reading\"&gt;tarot card readers&lt;/a&gt; call the \"&lt;a href=\"Minor%20Arcana\"&gt;Minor Arcana&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTarot cards are used throughout much of &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; to play &lt;a href=\"tarot%20card%20games\"&gt;tarot card games&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for &lt;a href=\"Tarot%20reading\"&gt;divinatory&lt;/a&gt; purposes.\nDivination usage.\nOften used to represent a young person. Can mean a changing of your line of work and/or taking on more responsibility. But primarily, this is the card for students."
