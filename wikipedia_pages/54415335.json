    "text": "The \u0160koda 7\u00a0cm guns were a family of &lt;a href=\"Naval%20artillery\"&gt;naval guns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dual-purpose%20gun\"&gt;dual-purpose gun&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Empire\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Empire&lt;/a&gt; that were developed and produced for the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Navy\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Navy&lt;/a&gt; in the years before and during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. These guns were actually 66\u00a0mm, but the classification system for artillery rounded up to the next highest centimeter. Following the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Powers\"&gt;Central Powers&lt;/a&gt; in World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire the ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy were divided among the victorious allies and some guns continued to be used until &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction.\nThe 7\u00a0cm guns were developed and built at the Pilsen works between 1892 through 1918. The barrel was made of steel with a horizontal &lt;a href=\"Rifled%20breech%20loader%23The%20sliding%20block\"&gt;sliding-wedge&lt;/a&gt; breech, they used fixed &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23Fixed%20QF\"&gt;quick fire&lt;/a&gt; ammunition and most ranged in length between 26 and 45 calibers. There was a single &lt;a href=\"Hydraulic%20recoil%20mechanism\"&gt;hydraulic recoil cylinder&lt;/a&gt; beneath the barrel and most were aimed by shoulder pads. The G. L/18 was a landing gun which could be taken ashore to provide support for a landing party. Initially these guns were deployed as anti-torpedo boat guns and had an elevation of -10\u00b0 to +20\u00b0. \u0160koda engineers later developed anti-aircraft mounts which could elevate from -10\u00b0 to +90\u00b0, but the ballistic performance for the guns remained the same.\nAcronyms associated with these guns include:\nHistory.\nThe \u0160koda 7\u00a0cm were mounted aboard &lt;a href=\"coastal%20defence%20ship\"&gt;coastal defence ship&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"minelayer\"&gt;minelayer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Monitor%20%28warship%29\"&gt;monitors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pre-dreadnought%20battleship\"&gt;pre-dreadnought battleship&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"protected%20cruiser\"&gt;protected cruiser&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s of the Austro-Hungarian Navy.\nCoastal defense ships:\nDestroyers:\nMinelayers:\nMonitors:\nPre-dreadnought battleships:\nProtected cruisers:\nSubmarines:\nTorpedo boats:\nTorpedo cruisers:\nAmmunition.\nAmmunition was of &lt;a href=\"Glossary%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23Fixed%20QF\"&gt;fixed QF type&lt;/a&gt;.
