    "text": "The Atlantic City catboat is an American &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt; that was designed by D. Martin as a &lt;a href=\"Cruising%20%28maritime%29\"&gt;cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and first built in 1980.\nThe design can be confused with the unrelated 1913 &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20City%20Catboat%20Class\"&gt;Atlantic City Catboat Class&lt;/a&gt;.\nProduction.\nThe design was built by &lt;a href=\"Mark-O%20Custom%20Boats\"&gt;Mark-O Custom Boats&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, starting in 1980, but it is now out of production.\nDesign.\nThe Atlantic City is a recreational &lt;a href=\"keelboat\"&gt;keelboat&lt;/a&gt;, built predominantly of solid laminate \"fabmat\" (stitched &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt; fabric), with wood trim. It is a &lt;a href=\"gaff%20rig\"&gt;gaff rig&lt;/a&gt;ged &lt;a href=\"catboat\"&gt;catboat&lt;/a&gt; with wooden spars. The hull has a &lt;a href=\"plumb%20stem\"&gt;plumb stem&lt;/a&gt;, an angled &lt;a href=\"Transom%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;transom&lt;/a&gt;, a shallow-draft, transom-hung &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"tiller\"&gt;tiller&lt;/a&gt; or optional &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20wheel\"&gt;wheel&lt;/a&gt; and a retractable &lt;a href=\"centerboard\"&gt;centerboard&lt;/a&gt;. It displaces and carries of ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of with the centerboard extended and with it retracted.\nThe boat is fitted with a German &lt;a href=\"BMW\"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt; of for docking and maneuvering. The fresh water tank has a capacity of .\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for six people, consisting of a convertible aft dinette area double berth and two forward cabin settees with pilot berths above them. It has an optional &lt;a href=\"Galley%20%28kitchen%29\"&gt;galley&lt;/a&gt; on the port side just forward of the &lt;a href=\"companionway\"&gt;companionway&lt;/a&gt; ladder. The galley is \"L\"-shaped and is equipped with a two-burner stove. A navigation station and a fireplace were also factory options. The &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is located in the forepeak. The cabin has of headroom.\nFor sailing the design is equipped with &lt;a href=\"mainsail\"&gt;mainsail&lt;/a&gt; hoops in place of more conventional cars.\nOperational history.\nIn a 1994 review Richard Sherwood described the design as a classic catboat.\nIn a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, \"if you've ever heard the sailor's description of a cozy cruiser, 'drinks six, eats four, sleeps two,' you'll appreciate that this boat is different: she drinks eight (if squeezed into the cockpit at anchor), eats four (at a dinette below, unless you go for trays on laps), and sleeps six (double berth under the starboard cockpit, upper and lower berths to starboard forward, and a dinette that converts to another double). We can\u2019t imagine who would want to sleep six in what amounts to a large &lt;a href=\"walk-in%20closet\"&gt;walk-in closet&lt;/a&gt;, unless it\u2019s a family with four small kids. Best features: For the large, close-knit family that is totally committed to catboats, this might be a good choice ... Worst features: Her sail area of 452 square feet, all in one big piece of cloth, can be hard to manage. Her centerboard shape, with its cutout forward to avoid cluttering up the cabin with a centerboard trunk, could be a problem too.\"\nSee also.\nSimilar sailboats"
