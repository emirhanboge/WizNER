    "title": "List of Surakarta and Yogyakarta nobility titles",
    "text": "This is a list of noble titles commonly used at the &lt;a href=\"Surakarta%20Sunanate\"&gt;Surakarta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogyakarta%20Sultanate\"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt; courts, including the &lt;a href=\"Mangkunegaran%20Palace\"&gt;Mangkunegaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pakualaman\"&gt;Pakualaman&lt;/a&gt; palaces. As the symbols and centres of Javanese culture, the sovereigns of both these courts still hold high esteem in Javanese society and Indonesian society in general. The &lt;a href=\"Vorstenlanden\"&gt;Princely Families&lt;/a&gt; are still known by their noble titles. Many people with distant familial relations to the Palaces also use noble titles, which sometimes are included in the official register of the names. &lt;a href=\"Abdi%20dalem\"&gt;Abdi dalem&lt;/a&gt; with prominent stature are also granted titles. The sovereigns also still grant titles to certain persons deemed helpful in maintaining Javanese traditions and the dignity of the royal courts, even to non-Javanese.\nAs Indonesia is not a monarchy, the Government of Indonesia does not confer any noble titles on its citizens. However, noble titles are still recognised officially as distinct from personal names. This is in contrast with the situation in \"e.g.\" Germany or Austria, in which personal names were forced to be used after the abolition of the monarchies. Minister of Home Affairs' Regulation no. 25 year 2011 is one example of such state regulations that recognises and governs the use of noble titles within the Indonesian administration. Even the second vice-president of Indonesia (1973-1978) \u2014 who was also the &lt;a href=\"sultan\"&gt;sultan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yogyakarta\"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 was known officially by his regnal name, &lt;a href=\"Hamengkubuwono%20IX\"&gt;Hamengkubuwono IX&lt;/a&gt;. \nThis list is created to help readers from a non-Javanese background to distinguish the noble titles from the personal names of individuals commonly known only by their noble titles. Notable examples are Raden Adjeng (R.A.) &lt;a href=\"Kartini\"&gt;Kartini&lt;/a&gt;, Raden Panji (R.P.) &lt;a href=\"Soeroso\"&gt;Soeroso&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mas%20Tirtodarmo%20Haryono\"&gt;M. T. (Mas Tirtodharmo) Haryono&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that in Javanese alphabet the phoneme /&lt;a href=\"Open-mid%20back%20rounded%20vowel\"&gt;\u0254&lt;/a&gt;/ is written with same letter and sign as '&lt;a href=\"a\"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;'. In Indonesian newspapers the sound /\u0254/ is generally written with the letter 'o', hence allowing for another mistake in pronunciation (with the phoneme /&lt;a href=\"Close-mid%20back%20rounded%20vowel\"&gt;o&lt;/a&gt;/. The letter \u00e5 in this list is used to show such difference and to prevent such mistake. The same purpose is also intended with the use of the letter \u00e8 to represent /&lt;a href=\"Open-mid%20front%20unrounded%20vowel\"&gt;\u025b&lt;/a&gt;/. Plain e is pronounced /&lt;a href=\"Mid%20central%20vowel\"&gt;\u0259&lt;/a&gt;/.\nThe common abbreviations in &lt;a href=\"Indonesian%20language\"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; modern spelling are written next to each of the titles."
