    "title": "Panamanian cuisine",
    "text": "Panamanian cuisine is a mix of African, Spanish, and &lt;a href=\"Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas\"&gt;Native American&lt;/a&gt; techniques, dishes, and ingredients, reflecting its diverse population. Since &lt;a href=\"Panama\"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt; is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking.\nCommon ingredients in Panamanian food are maize, rice, wheat flour, &lt;a href=\"Plantain%20%28cooking%29\"&gt;plantains&lt;/a&gt;, \"yuca\" (&lt;a href=\"cassava\"&gt;cassava&lt;/a&gt;), beef, &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20as%20food\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;, pork and seafood.\nDishes.\nCorn-based dishes come from the kernel, cooked in water and then ground in order to obtain a dough (as opposed to using corn flour to obtain the dough). Fresh corn is also used in some dishes. Due to the multicultural background of the Panamanians, many of its dishes are heavily influenced by the cuisine of other Latin American countries and also the Caribbean as well as European. Some of the main meals, dishes and specialties include:\nDrinks.\nIn Panama there were bars that catered to local businessmen, tourists and gamblers and some that were frequented by US military personnel. The latter mostly had a reputation as \"shot and beer\" dives with unknown names. One of these bars, Kresch's Place published a drink recipe book. Several of the drinks are named after bases, submarines, forts, ships and other military institutions. The \"U.S.S. 44 Special\" was &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tom%20gin\"&gt;Old Tom gin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sloe%20gin\"&gt;sloe gin&lt;/a&gt; and lime juice. The U.S.S. Mallard was aged rum (Panamanian, Venezuelan and Colombian), red &lt;a href=\"vermouth\"&gt;vermouth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dictine\"&gt;B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"absinthe\"&gt;absinthe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angostura%20bitters\"&gt;Angostura bitters&lt;/a&gt; garnished with lemon peel. The cover of the recipe book shows soldiers, sailors and an Army officer drinking.\nSpecial occasions.\nChristmas.\nThe traditional Panamanian dish for Christmas usually includes chicken &lt;a href=\"tamale\"&gt;tamale&lt;/a&gt;s, \"&lt;a href=\"arroz%20con%20pollo\"&gt;arroz con pollo&lt;/a&gt;\" (rice with chicken), \"puerco asado\", \"&lt;a href=\"pernil\"&gt;pernil&lt;/a&gt;\", \"pavo\" (&lt;a href=\"Turkey%20%28bird%29\"&gt;turkey&lt;/a&gt;), and \"&lt;a href=\"relleno\"&gt;relleno&lt;/a&gt;\" (stuffing). Bowls of fruits and fruitcake are set out on the tables along with the dishes. Along with these foods and dessert, a traditional drink is served called \"Ron Ponche\" (&lt;a href=\"eggnog\"&gt;eggnog&lt;/a&gt;), and different recipes are available. An easy one consists of two cans of &lt;a href=\"condensed%20milk\"&gt;condensed milk&lt;/a&gt;, three cans of &lt;a href=\"evaporated%20milk\"&gt;evaporated milk&lt;/a&gt;, six eggs, and a half a bottle of &lt;a href=\"rum\"&gt;rum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nutmeg\"&gt;nutmeg&lt;/a&gt; for some extra flavor."
