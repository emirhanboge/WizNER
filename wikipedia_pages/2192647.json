    "text": "The West Virginia Senate is the &lt;a href=\"upper%20house\"&gt;upper house&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia%20Legislature\"&gt;West Virginia Legislature&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are seventeen senatorial districts. Each district has two senators who serve staggered four-year terms. The Republicans gained three seats in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20West%20Virginia%20Senate%20election\"&gt;2020 senate election&lt;/a&gt;, bringing their total number of seats to 23, while the Democrats hold 11 seats.\nOrganization.\nSenators are elected for terms of four years that are staggered, meaning that only a portion of the 34 state senate seats are up every election.\nThe state legislature meets on the second Wednesday of January each year and conducts a 60-day regular session.\nLegislative process.\nUnlike most state senates, the West Virginia Senate can introduce revenue bills. Bills must undergo three readings in each house before being sent to the governor. Bills are drafted by the Office of Legislative Services or legislative staff counsel, reviewed by the sponsor of the bill and submitted for introduction. Bills are assigned to committees that make recommendations about a bill in the form of a committee report.\nBills approved in both the West Virginia Senate and &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates\"&gt;West Virginia House of Delegates&lt;/a&gt; are then submitted to the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;governor&lt;/a&gt;, who has the power to sign them into law or veto them. The state legislature can override the veto, unless they have already adjourned.\nDistricts.\nThe state is divided into 17 districts, with each electing a senator for a four year term every two years. Thus each district contains about 1/17th of the state's population, or about 105,000 persons.\nThe state's districting system is unique in the United States in that both senators from a district cannot be from the same county, no matter the population of the various parts of the district. This means, for example, that one of the 5th District's two senators must reside in &lt;a href=\"Cabell%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Cabell County&lt;/a&gt; and the other must reside in the portion of &lt;a href=\"Wayne%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Wayne County&lt;/a&gt; that is inside the 5th District, even though Cabell County has more people than the portion of Wayne County that is part of the 5th District. However, both senators are elected by everybody within the district, not just by the people of the county in which the senators reside.\nResponding to the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 Census&lt;/a&gt; the Senate redistricted itself. Kanawha County was divided for the first time in the Senate's history, with the northern and western portions joining a part of &lt;a href=\"Putnam%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia\"&gt;Putnam County&lt;/a&gt; as the 8th District and the remainder of the county constituting the 17th district on its own. This reduced the number of Senators from Kanawha County from four to three, as one of the 8th's had to be a resident of Putnam.\nResponding to the &lt;a href=\"2020%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2020 Census&lt;/a&gt; the Senate again redistricted itself. The Senate adopted a new map, again reflecting a shift of the population to the Morgantown area and the Eastern Panhandle. Ten counties, out of the 55, were divided between two different districts, and Kanawha County was divided between three different districts.\nBecause senators are elected for four-year terms, the redistricting will not come fully into effect until after the 2024 election, with 17 senators to be elected under the new map in 2022, while those elected in 2020 under the old map will continue to serve until 2024.\nSenate President.\nThe Senate elects its own president from its membership. &lt;a href=\"Craig%20Blair\"&gt;Craig Blair&lt;/a&gt; is currently the President of the West Virginia Senate.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"West%20Virginia%20Constitution\"&gt;West Virginia Constitution&lt;/a&gt; does not create or even mention the title of &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20governor%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;lieutenant governor&lt;/a&gt;, West Virginia Code 6A-1-4 creates this designation for the Senate President, who stands first in the line of succession to the office of governor. As stated in Article 7 Section 16 of the constitution: \"In case of the death, conviction or impeachment, failure to qualify, resignation, or other disability of the governor, the president of the Senate shall act as governor until the vacancy is filled, or the disability removed.\" However, the Senate President may not always serve the remainder of the term as the constitution also states: \"Whenever a vacancy shall occur in the office of governor before the first three years of the term shall have expired, a new election for governor shall take place to fill the vacancy.\""
