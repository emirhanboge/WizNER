    "text": "Joseph diGenova (born February 22, 1945) is an American &lt;a href=\"lawyer\"&gt;lawyer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"political%20commentator\"&gt;political commentator&lt;/a&gt; who served as the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Attorney%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia\"&gt;United States Attorney for the District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt; from 1983 to 1988. He and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Toensing\"&gt;Victoria Toensing&lt;/a&gt;, are partners in the &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, law firm diGenova and Toensing. He is known for promoting conspiracy theories about the &lt;a href=\"Department%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"FBI\"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;. He and Toensing frequently appeared on &lt;a href=\"Fox%20News\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Business\"&gt;Fox Business&lt;/a&gt; channels, until diGenova used a November 2019 appearance to spread &lt;a href=\"conspiracy%20theories%20about%20George%20Soros\"&gt;conspiracy theories about George Soros&lt;/a&gt;, leading to widespread calls for him to be banned from the network.\nIn March 2018, President Donald Trump announced that diGenova and Toensing would join his legal defense team during the &lt;a href=\"Mueller%20investigation\"&gt;Mueller investigation&lt;/a&gt;; the appointments were withdrawn days later, citing an unspecified conflict of interest, though Trump personal attorney &lt;a href=\"Jay%20Sekulow\"&gt;Jay Sekulow&lt;/a&gt; said they might assist in other legal matters. In July 2019, diGenova and Toensing began representing Ukrainian oligarch &lt;a href=\"Dmitry%20Firtash\"&gt;Dmitry Firtash&lt;/a&gt; to assist his efforts to avoid extradition to the United States under a federal indictment, as their associate and Trump's personal attorney &lt;a href=\"Rudy%20Giuliani\"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt; sought information in Ukraine to damage Democratic presidential candidate &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Biden\"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;. In November 2020, Trump named diGenova, Toensing, &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Powell\"&gt;Sidney Powell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jenna%20Ellis\"&gt;Jenna Ellis&lt;/a&gt; to join a legal team led by Giuliani to &lt;a href=\"Attempts%20to%20overturn%20the%202020%20United%20States%20presidential%20election\"&gt;overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt; in which Trump was defeated.\nCareer in law and politics.\nDiGenova was an aide to Republican Senator &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Mathias\"&gt;Charles Mathias&lt;/a&gt; of Maryland, eventually serving as Mathias' legislative director. After Republicans won the U.S. Senate in the &lt;a href=\"1980%20United%20States%20Senate%20elections\"&gt;1980 elections&lt;/a&gt;, DiGenova was named chief counsel and staff director of the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20Rules%20Committee\"&gt;Senate Rules Committee&lt;/a&gt; and counsel to the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary\"&gt;Senate Judiciary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Homeland%20Security%20and%20Governmental%20Affairs\"&gt;Governmental Affairs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Intelligence\"&gt;Select Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; committees.\nU.S. attorney.\nAs a U.S. attorney, diGenova led the prosecution of &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Pollard\"&gt;Jonathan Pollard&lt;/a&gt;, who pleaded guilty in 1987 to spying for Israel.\nHe also led investigations into corruption in the administration of Washington, D.C., &lt;a href=\"Marion%20Barry\"&gt;Mayor Marion Barry&lt;/a&gt; that led to convictions of 12 officials, including two deputy mayors.\nCounsel investigations.\nDiGenova later served as &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice%20Office%20of%20Special%20Counsel\"&gt;Independent Counsel&lt;/a&gt; investigating the 1992 preelection search of then-candidate &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Clinton\"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s passport file by officials of the &lt;a href=\"Presidency%20of%20George%20H.%20W.%20Bush\"&gt;George H. W. Bush administration&lt;/a&gt;. DiGenova concluded that the passport search had been \"stupid, dumb and partisan,\" but not illegal, and that the government should apologize to the officials who ordered the search.\nDiGenova and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Toensing\"&gt;Victoria Toensing&lt;/a&gt;, started their Washington law firm, diGenova &amp; Toensing, in January 1996.\nIn 1997, diGenova was named Special Counsel to investigate the &lt;a href=\"International%20Brotherhood%20of%20Teamsters\"&gt;International Brotherhood of Teamsters&lt;/a&gt;; afterward he was named to an independent review board to monitor the Teamsters.\nTrump presidency.\nScooter Libby.\nDiGenova called on President Trump to pardon &lt;a href=\"Scooter%20Libby\"&gt;Scooter Libby&lt;/a&gt;, adviser of &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Cheney\"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, who was found guilty of perjury in an investigation revolving around &lt;a href=\"Plame%20affair\"&gt;leaks of sensitive classified material&lt;/a&gt;. DiGenova is married to Libby's lawyer, Victoria Toensing. Trump pardoned Libby on April 13, 2018.\nRussian interference in the 2016 election.\nDiGenova, who frequently appears as a &lt;a href=\"Political%20commentator\"&gt;commentator&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Fox%20News\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, has accused FBI officials of trying to \"&lt;a href=\"Frameup\"&gt;frame&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Trump\"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; for \"nonexistent\" crimes. On March 19, 2018, he and his spouse, Victoria Toensing, were hired to serve on Trump's legal team for the &lt;a href=\"Special%20Counsel%20investigation%20%282017%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;Special Counsel investigation&lt;/a&gt;. However, Trump backtracked the hires several days later due to potential &lt;a href=\"conflicts%20of%20interest\"&gt;conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt;. The president hoped diGenova could function as a stand-in for him on television and spearhead the attacks on Mueller and the investigation.\nIn April 2018, diGenova called for the firing of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said that special counsel Robert Mueller's team investigating &lt;a href=\"Russian%20interference%20in%20the%202016%20United%20States%20elections\"&gt;Russian interference in the 2016 election&lt;/a&gt; were \"legal terrorists\" and called former FBI Director &lt;a href=\"James%20Comey\"&gt;James Comey&lt;/a&gt; \"a dirty cop\". In May 2018 tweet, Trump quoted diGenova as saying \"The recusal of &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Sessions\"&gt;Jeff Sessions&lt;/a&gt; was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States.\"\nOn February 21, 2019, diGenova stated in the podcast of &lt;a href=\"Laura%20Ingraham\"&gt;Laura Ingraham&lt;/a&gt; that the US is in a &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; and that he advises friends to prepare for total war by voting and buying guns.\nKavanaugh appointment.\nOn September 18, 2018, diGenova discounted charges that U.S. &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; nominee &lt;a href=\"Brett%20Kavanaugh\"&gt;Brett Kavanaugh&lt;/a&gt;, then 17 years old, had allegedly sexually assaulted a 15-year-old &lt;a href=\"Christine%20Blasey%20Ford\"&gt;Christine Blasey Ford&lt;/a&gt; at a party. The allegations referred to a time when Kavanaugh was attending &lt;a href=\"Georgetown%20Preparatory%20School\"&gt;Georgetown Preparatory School&lt;/a&gt;. On Fox News, diGenova said if Ford testified, \"she's going to look like the loon that she is.\"\nUkraine investigations.\nIn July 2019, diGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, were hired by the Ukrainian oligarch &lt;a href=\"Dmytro%20Firtash\"&gt;Dmytro Firtash&lt;/a&gt;, to defend Firtash from extradition to the United States on corruption charges related to a mining permit in India. In 2017, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Justice%20Department\"&gt;United States Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; described Firtash as an \"upper-echelon [associate] of Russian organized crime.\" As a middleman for the Russian natural gas giant &lt;a href=\"Gazprom\"&gt;Gazprom&lt;/a&gt;, Firtash was known for funneling money to campaigns of pro-Russia politicians in &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and is also a onetime business partner of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Manafort\"&gt;Paul Manafort&lt;/a&gt;, a Trump 2016 campaign chairman. When he was vice president, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Biden\"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; had urged the Ukrainian government to eliminate middlemen such as Firtash from the country's natural gas industry, and to reduce the country's reliance on imports of Russian natural gas.\nIn August 2019, diGenova and Toensing met with Attorney General &lt;a href=\"William%20Barr\"&gt;William Barr&lt;/a&gt; to argue against the charges for Firtash. Prior to that meeting, Barr had been briefed in detail on the initial &lt;a href=\"Trump-Ukraine%20scandal\"&gt;Trump-Ukraine scandal&lt;/a&gt; whistleblower complaint within the CIA that had been forwarded to the Justice Department, as well as on Giuliani's activities in Ukraine. Barr declined to intercede, according to sources who talked to \"The Washington Post\".\nIn October 2019, &lt;a href=\"Lev%20Parnas%20and%20Igor%20Fruman\"&gt;Lev Parnas&lt;/a&gt;, a businessman who was working for diGenova and Toensing's firm as an interpreter in the Firtash case, was one of two men arrested at &lt;a href=\"Washington%20Dulles%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Dulles International Airport&lt;/a&gt; and accused by federal prosecutors of funneling foreign money into U.S. elections. \"The New York Times\" reported in November 2019 that Giuliani had directed Parnas to approach Firtash with the recommendation to hire diGenova and Toensing, with the proposition that Firtash could help to provide compromising information on Joe Biden, an arrangement Parnas's attorney Joseph Bondy described was \"part of any potential resolution to [Firtash's] extradition matter.\" In November 2019, Bondy told \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Washington%20Post\"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;\" that Parnas had been part of \"a group that met frequently in spring 2019 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., to discuss the Biden matter, among other topics. The group, according to Bondy, was convened by Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, and included Parnas, his business associate Igor Fruman, as well as journalist John Solomon and the husband-and-wife legal team of Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing.\" After Firtash hired diGenova and Toensing, Giuliani acquired a statement from former Ukrainian &lt;a href=\"prosecutor%20general\"&gt;prosecutor general&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Viktor%20Shokin\"&gt;Viktor Shokin&lt;/a&gt; that falsely alleged Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire him in an effort to cover up corruption by Biden and his son. Shokin's statement noted that it was prepared \"at the request of lawyers acting for Dmitry Firtash.\" Giuliani had presented the Shokin statement during television appearances, and \"Bloomberg News\" reported that its sources told them Giuliani's publicity of the Shokin statement had greatly reduced the chances of the Justice Department dropping the charges against Firtash, as it would appear to be a political \"quid pro quo\".\nDiGenova and Toensing worked with &lt;a href=\"Rudy%20Giuliani\"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine%20scandal\"&gt;opposition research&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; to be used against the 2020 Democratic candidate &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Biden\"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href=\"Fox%20News%20Sunday\"&gt;Fox News Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. All three were working off the books, outside the administration, according to Fox News. \"The only person in government who knows what they were doing is President Trump,\" Fox host &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Wallace\"&gt;Chris Wallace&lt;/a&gt; said. DiGenova called the story \"categorically false.\"\nDiGenova and Toensing are lawyers for &lt;a href=\"John%20Solomon%20%28political%20commentator%29\"&gt;John Solomon&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative columnist who has written stories favorable to Trump on scandals involving Ukraine and Russia. \"John Solomon has been a client of our firm for a very long time,\" diGenova told \"Politico\".\nIn November 2019, in an appearance on Fox News, diGenova claimed that &lt;a href=\"George%20Soros\"&gt;George Soros&lt;/a&gt; \"controls a very large part of the career foreign service of the United States &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20State\"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"also controls the activities of FBI agents overseas who work for NOG's, work with &lt;a href=\"Non-governmental%20organization\"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;'s. That was very evident in Ukraine.\" The &lt;a href=\"Open%20Society%20Foundations\"&gt;Open Society Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, founded by Soros, described diGenova's claims as \"beyond rhetorical ugliness, beyond fiction, beyond ludicrous\" and requested that Fox News provide an on-air retraction of diGenova's claims, and stop providing diGenova with a platform. Although the network never publicly announced it had banned diGenova, , diGenova had not appeared on Fox following the incident. In September 2020, diGenova said, \"I don't know what George Soros has on &lt;a href=\"Suzanne%20Scott\"&gt;Suzanne Scott&lt;/a&gt;, the head of Fox, but the bottom line is this: that network is compromised when it comes to Soros.\"\nClaims of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election.\nIn November 2020, President Donald Trump named diGenova, Toensing, &lt;a href=\"Sidney%20Powell\"&gt;Sidney Powell&lt;/a&gt; and Jenna Ellis to join a legal team led by Rudy Giuliani to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election in which Trump was defeated.\nOn November 30, 2020, diGenova used an appearance on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Howie%20Carr%20Show\"&gt;The Howie Carr Show&lt;/a&gt;\" (released on &lt;a href=\"YouTube\"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;) to call for &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Krebs\"&gt;Chris Krebs&lt;/a&gt; to be \"&lt;a href=\"drawn%20and%20quartered\"&gt;drawn and quartered&lt;/a&gt;. Taken out at dawn and shot\". DiGenova's specific criticism was that Krebs \"thinks the election went well\". Krebs was the former &lt;a href=\"Director%20of%20the%20Cybersecurity%20and%20Infrastructure%20Security%20Agency\"&gt;Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security\"&gt;United States Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; and had been fired by Trump earlier that month for contradicting Trump's claims of widespread election fraud. On December 8 Krebs filed a civil lawsuit against diGenova, the Trump campaign, and Newsmax TV, accusing them of \"defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, aiding and abetting, and civil conspiracy\". He said that he has received \"a barrage of threats and harassment\" as a result of diGenova's comments and \"faces a genuine risk of imminent harm.\""
