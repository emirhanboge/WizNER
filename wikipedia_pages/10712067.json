    "text": "The Comfort Classic was a &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; tournament on the &lt;a href=\"Champions%20Tour\"&gt;Champions Tour&lt;/a&gt; from 1988 to 2000. It was played in &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana\"&gt;Indianapolis, Indiana&lt;/a&gt; at the Broadmoor Country Club (1988\u20131993) and at the &lt;a href=\"Indianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway\"&gt;Brickyard Crossing&lt;/a&gt; Golf Club (1994\u20132000). Title sponsorship was from &lt;a href=\"Comfort%20Inn\"&gt;Comfort Inn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe purse for the 2000 tournament was US$1,250,000, with $187,500 going to the winner. The tournament was founded in 1988 as the GTE North Classic.\nIn 2000, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway started hosting the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Grand%20Prix\"&gt;United States Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;, which created an unfavorable tight scheduling conflict with the golf tournament. In addition, competitors had begun voicing complaints about the unchallenging nature of how the course was being set up for tournament play. In December 2000, Comfort Inns ended their sponsorship, and the event was not held again.\nWinners.\nComfort Classic at the Brickyard\nBrickyard Crossing Championship Produced by the Brickyard Foundation\nBrickyard Crossing Championship\nBrickyard Crossing Championship presented by GTE\nGTE North Classic\nSource:"
