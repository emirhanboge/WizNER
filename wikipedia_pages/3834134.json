    "text": "Sosban Fach (&lt;a href=\"Welsh%20Language\"&gt;Welsh&lt;/a&gt; for \"Little Saucepan\") is a traditional Welsh &lt;a href=\"folk%20music\"&gt;folk&lt;/a&gt; song. It is one of the best-known and most often sung songs in the Welsh language.\nThe song is based on a verse written by &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Davies%20%28Mynyddog%29\"&gt;Mynyddog&lt;/a&gt; in 1873 as part of his song \"Rheolau yr Aelwyd\" (\"Rules of the home\") \u2014 see below. Talog Williams, an accountant from Dowlais, created the song we have today by altering Mynyddog's verse and adding four new verses. The song catalogues the troubles of a harassed housewife.\nThe song is associated with the &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Llanelli%20RFC\"&gt;Llanelli RFC&lt;/a&gt; and, more recently, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlets\"&gt;Scarlets&lt;/a&gt; regional rugby side. The association derives from &lt;a href=\"Llanelli\"&gt;Llanelli's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tinning\"&gt;tin plating&lt;/a&gt; industry, which used to tin-plate steel saucepans and other kitchen utensils as a cheap supply to the British public. During the final years of &lt;a href=\"Stradey%20Park\"&gt;Stradey Park&lt;/a&gt;, the former ground of Llanelli RFC and the Scarlets, the goalposts were adorned with Scarlet saucepans as a tribute to the town's history; the utensils have been transferred to the clubs' new ground, &lt;a href=\"Parc%20y%20Scarlets\"&gt;Parc y Scarlets&lt;/a&gt;. The Scarlets' official magazine is titled \"Sosban\".\n&lt;a href=\"Bryn%20Terfel\"&gt;Bryn Terfel&lt;/a&gt; recorded the song on his 2000 album \"&lt;a href=\"We%27ll%20Keep%20a%20Welcome%20%28album%29\"&gt;We'll Keep a Welcome&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLyrics.\nVariations.\nThis song has been adopted by the fans of the rugby team, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlets\"&gt;Llanelli Scarlets&lt;/a&gt;. Many English variations can be heard in the stands during rugby matches.\nAfter Llanelli beat a strong New Zealand side on 31 October 1972, a new English chorus could be heard:\nOther variations include the following.\nDafydd James refers to a player who scored the winning points in a &lt;a href=\"Heineken%20Cup\"&gt;Heineken Cup&lt;/a&gt; match.\nA verse was \"uncovered\" in Patagonia that is sung by descendants of Welsh settlers and follows the second original verse:\nOther media.\nAuthor &lt;a href=\"Diana%20Wynne%20Jones\"&gt;Diana Wynne Jones&lt;/a&gt; refers to the song several times as 'Calcifer's silly saucepan song' in her book \"&lt;a href=\"Howl%27s%20Moving%20Castle\"&gt;Howl's Moving Castle&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Welsh rock band &lt;a href=\"Man%20%28band%29\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; has a recording of the song on the live album \"Back Into the Future\", 1973. It is sung by the &lt;a href=\"Gwalia%20Male%20Choir\"&gt;Gwalia Male Choir&lt;/a&gt;.\nExternal links.\nLive performance here :"
