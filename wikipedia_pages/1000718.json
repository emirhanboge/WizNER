    "text": "Seattle Opera is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; company based in &lt;a href=\"Seattle%2C%20Washington\"&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded in 1963 by &lt;a href=\"Glynn%20Ross\"&gt;Glynn Ross&lt;/a&gt;, who served as its first general director until 1983. The company's season runs from August through late May, comprising five or six operas of eight to ten performances each, often featuring double casts in major roles to allow for successive evening presentations. \nSince August 2003, Seattle Opera has performed at &lt;a href=\"McCaw%20Hall\"&gt;Marion Oliver McCaw Hall&lt;/a&gt; (capacity: 2,967), which was built on the site of the old Seattle Opera House at &lt;a href=\"Seattle%20Center\"&gt;Seattle Center&lt;/a&gt;. The company's current general director is &lt;a href=\"Christina%20Scheppelmann\"&gt;Christina Scheppelmann&lt;/a&gt;, who assumed the role in August 2019. Seattle Opera does not have a full-time music director; in October 2007, it announced the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Asher%20Fisch\"&gt;Asher Fisch&lt;/a&gt; as its principal guest conductor.\nThe Ross years.\nFrom the outset, Ross saw opera as something that had to be sold using similar techniques to those used to sell popular entertainment. \"To sell opera\u2026you have to get their attention with a little razzle-dazzle. You've got to be simpatico. You have to be able to communicate, and you have to deliver your message with the best possible product you can manage.\" In 1970, &lt;a href=\"Harold%20C.%20Schonberg\"&gt;H. C. Schonberg&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" contrasted Seattle Opera's approach to marketing to the then still staid marketing of New York's &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt;: \"Out there, you see campaign buttons with the legend \"Opera Lives\". It is in Seattle where you can look at the sky and find an airplane skywriting the virtues of Seattle Opera. There are even auto &lt;a href=\"bumper%20sticker\"&gt;bumper sticker&lt;/a&gt;s about opera.\" Further, Schonberg remarked favorably on the \"air of freshness and experimentation that contrasts vividly with the dull, tried and true, tired professionalism in other opera houses one could mention.\"\nRichard Wagner at Seattle Opera.\nThe company is noted for its performances of the works of &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Wagner\"&gt;Richard Wagner&lt;/a&gt;, including the \"&lt;a href=\"Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen\"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;\" cycle. In 1975, it was the first American company to perform the cycle in its entirety over the space of a week since the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt; in 1939.\n\"Ring 1,\" 1975\u20131984.\nBeginning with a production of \"&lt;a href=\"Die%20Walk%C3%BCre\"&gt;Die Walk\u00fcre&lt;/a&gt;\" one year, and following successively each year with \"&lt;a href=\"Siegfried%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Siegfried&lt;/a&gt;\" and, finally, \"&lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung\"&gt;G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung&lt;/a&gt;\", Ross announced in 1975 that \"&lt;a href=\"Das%20Rheingold\"&gt;Das Rheingold&lt;/a&gt;\" would precede the others to make up the first consecutive Ring Cycle over six days in July. In spite of the modernization of the opera productions which Ross found at the &lt;a href=\"Bayreuth%20Festival\"&gt;Bayreuth Festival&lt;/a&gt;, Seattle's were to be traditional productions and appeal to the lovers of the traditional.\nTwo back-to-back cycles of the \"Ring\", one each in German and English, were presented annually between 1975 and 1983. &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Porter%20%28opera%20translator%29\"&gt;Andrew Porter&lt;/a&gt;'s English adaptation which was prepared for the &lt;a href=\"English%20National%20Opera\"&gt;English National Opera&lt;/a&gt; and which was priced below the German language cycle, introduced many new listeners to Wagner. Originally directed by &lt;a href=\"George%20London%20%28bass-baritone%29\"&gt;George London&lt;/a&gt; with designer John Naccarato, later presentations were directed by Lincoln Clark between 1976 and 1983, and by the tenor, &lt;a href=\"Ragnar%20Ulfung\"&gt;Ragnar Ulfung&lt;/a&gt; in 1984. Henry Holt conducted all the cycles. The performances were well attended and received good press.\nBy 1982, the cycle was drawing opera lovers from all over the United States, as well as many other countries of the world, and Seattle appeared to be a serious rival to Bayreuth.\n\"Ring 2,\" 1985\u20131995.\nSpeight Jenkins was appointed General Director in 1983, and immediately set about creating a new \"Ring\" production. \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" appeared first, in 1985, followed by complete cycles in 1986, 1987, 1991, and 1995. (Jenkins determined that the company could achieve higher quality performances by presenting the \"Ring\" every four years.) The new production was directed by Francois Rochaix, with sets and costumes designed by Robert Israel, lighting designed by Joan Sullivan, and supertitles (the first ever created for the \"Ring\") by &lt;a href=\"Sonya%20Friedman\"&gt;Sonya Friedman&lt;/a&gt;. The production set the action in a world of nineteenth-century theatricality. Initially controversial, it sold out in 1995. Conductors included &lt;a href=\"Armin%20Jordan\"&gt;Armin Jordan&lt;/a&gt; (\"Die Walk\u00fcre\" in 1985), &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Rosenthal\"&gt;Manuel Rosenthal&lt;/a&gt; (1986), and &lt;a href=\"Hermann%20Michael\"&gt;Hermann Michael&lt;/a&gt; (1987, 1991, and 1995).\n\"Ring 3,\" 2000\u20132013.\nJenkins engaged a new creative team to conceive Seattle Opera's third \"Ring\" production, which was unveiled in 2000 (\"Das Rheingold\" and \"Die Walk\u00fcre\") and 2001 (full cycle) and returned in 2005, 2009, and 2013. Director &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Wadsworth\"&gt;Stephen Wadsworth&lt;/a&gt;, Set Designer Thomas Lynch, Costume Designer &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Pakledinaz\"&gt;Martin Pakledinaz&lt;/a&gt;, Lighting Designer &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Kaczorowski\"&gt;Peter Kaczorowski&lt;/a&gt; created a production which became known as the \"Green\" \"Ring\", inspired in part by the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest. Armin Jordan returned to conduct in 2000, Franz Vote in 2001, and &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Spano\"&gt;Robert Spano&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 and 2009. The 2013 production, conducted by &lt;a href=\"Asher%20Fisch\"&gt;Asher Fisch&lt;/a&gt;, was released as a commercial recording on compact disc and on iTunes. The productions starred singers such as &lt;a href=\"Greer%20Grimsley\"&gt;Greer Grimsley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stephanie%20Blythe\"&gt;Stephanie Blythe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ewa%20Podle%C5%9B\"&gt;Ewa Podles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Eaglen\"&gt;Jane Eaglen&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Paul Fink, &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Jane%20Wray\"&gt;Margaret Jane Wray&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Milling\"&gt;Stephen Milling&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeight Jenkins and Wagner.\nUpon taking leadership of Seattle Opera in 1983, Speight Jenkins stated a goal of producing all ten of the major Wagner works in Seattle. Beginning with \"&lt;a href=\"Tannh%C3%A4user%20%28opera%29\"&gt;Tannh\u00e4user&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1984 (the first Seattle Opera production with supertitles), Jenkins finally achieved his goal with the August 2003 production of \"&lt;a href=\"Parsifal\"&gt;Parsifal&lt;/a&gt;\" that opened McCaw Hall.\nPerformers.\nSeattle Opera draws some of the world's best opera singers to its stage.
