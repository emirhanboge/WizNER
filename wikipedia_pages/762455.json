He was &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Commerce%20and%20Labor\"&gt;Secretary of Commerce and Labor&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"William%20Howard%20Taft\"&gt;William Howard Taft&lt;/a&gt;'s administration (1909\u20131913) and was one of the key founders of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce\"&gt;United States Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife and career.\nNagel was born on August 9, 1849, in &lt;a href=\"Colorado%20County%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Colorado County, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Friedericke (Litzmann) and Hermann Nagel. Nagel moved to a boarding school in St. Louis, Missouri, for high school and stayed to study law at &lt;a href=\"Washington%20University%20Law%20School\"&gt;Washington University Law School&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated with his law degree in 1872. Nagel furthered his education by traveling to Europe and learning political economy at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Berlin\"&gt;University of Berlin&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturning to St. Louis in 1873, Nagel joined the state bar and began to practice law. He was a member of the firm Finkelnburg, Nagel and Kirby, and later of Nagel and Kirby. His first foray into politics came when he won election to the &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;Missouri House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; in 1881, where he served until 1883. He was president of the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; city council from 1893 to 1897. He also taught at St. Louis Law School (1885\u20131909) and was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20National%20Committee\"&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/a&gt; (1908\u20131912).\nNagel was a corporate attorney for &lt;a href=\"Adolphus%20Busch\"&gt;Adolphus Busch&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"William%20Howard%20Taft\"&gt;William Howard Taft&lt;/a&gt; chose him, in 1909, as &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Commerce%20and%20Labor\"&gt;Secretary of Commerce and Labor&lt;/a&gt;, a position he held until the end of the Taft administration in 1913. He was the last person to serve in the post before it was separated to two &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Cabinet\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; positions, &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Commerce\"&gt;Secretary of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Labor\"&gt;Secretary of Labor&lt;/a&gt;. While heading the Department of Commerce and Labor, Nagel made it more accessible to the needs of businessmen while also expanding the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization.\nNagel was also a founder of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce\"&gt;United States Chamber of Commerce&lt;/a&gt;. Following his time in the cabinet, Nagel returned to the practice of law, arguing before the Supreme Court three times before his death. He died in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;St. Louis, Missouri&lt;/a&gt; on January 5, 1940 and was interred there in &lt;a href=\"Bellefontaine%20Cemetery\"&gt;Bellefontaine Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamily.\nNagel was married twice: first, in 1876, to Fannie Brandeis, the sister of &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Dembitz%20Brandeis\"&gt;Louis Dembitz Brandeis&lt;/a&gt;, later a &lt;a href=\"Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Supreme%20Court\"&gt;Supreme Court justice&lt;/a&gt;. She died in 1889 and he married Anne Shepley in 1895. He had six children, including &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Nagel%20%28architect%29\"&gt;Charles Nagel, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, an architect and curator."
