    "text": "Sister Maurina &lt;a href=\"Third%20Order%20of%20St.%20Francis\"&gt;O.S.F.&lt;/a&gt; (1926\u20132011), born Maurina Borges da Silveira, was a Brazilian &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Franciscan\"&gt;Franciscan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nun%23Religious%20Sister\"&gt;Sister&lt;/a&gt;. She was the only Religious Sister to be &lt;a href=\"arrest\"&gt;arrest&lt;/a&gt;ed and &lt;a href=\"torture\"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt;d during the period of Brazil's &lt;a href=\"Military%20dictatorship%20%28Brazil%29\"&gt;military dictatorship&lt;/a&gt; (1964\u20131985).\nEarly life.\nSilveira was born into a humble family in &lt;a href=\"Minas%20Gerais\"&gt;Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt;. She was raised in the community of Perdizinha, in the municipality of &lt;a href=\"Perdizes%2C%20Minas%20Gerais\"&gt;Perdizes&lt;/a&gt;, between &lt;a href=\"Uberaba\"&gt;Uberaba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arax%C3%A1\"&gt;Arax\u00e1&lt;/a&gt;. Perdizinha is a cluster of 50 houses built around a chapel, where there was &lt;a href=\"Mass%20%28liturgy%29\"&gt;Mass&lt;/a&gt; once a month and praying the &lt;a href=\"rosary\"&gt;rosary&lt;/a&gt; every Sunday. Her father, Antonio, a devout Catholic, worked as a carpenter dedicated to the construction of &lt;a href=\"bullock%20cart\"&gt;bullock cart&lt;/a&gt;s. Altogether, the family consisted of 11 siblings, four of whom entered religious orders. Maurina discovered her religious inclination at age 7, after her father told her the story of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Francis%20of%20Assisi\"&gt;Saint Francis of Assisi&lt;/a&gt;, an enthusiast of religious life for women. At age 14, she convinced her parents to let her join the convent in Arax\u00e1.\nArrest.\nIn October 1969, Sister Maurina, then head of Lar Santana Orphanage in &lt;a href=\"Ribeir%C3%A3o%20Preto\"&gt;Ribeir\u00e3o Preto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29\"&gt;S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested. She was leasing, without her knowledge, a room of the orphanage to members of the &lt;a href=\"guerrilla\"&gt;guerrilla&lt;/a&gt; group For\u00e7as Armadas de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional (FALN). She was arrested, along with several members of FALN by Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Bandeirantes (OBAN) officers, and tortured for five months. Among other things, she was stripped naked, given electric shocks, and hung on the &lt;a href=\"Pau%20de%20Arara\"&gt;pau-de-arara&lt;/a&gt; torture device, in addition to being cursed, insulted, and threatened.\nThe arrest of Sister Maurina outraged many members of the Catholic community. \"Frei\" (Friar) Fel\u00edx Vasconcellos, &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor\"&gt;O.F.M.&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Ribeir%C3%A3o%20Preto\"&gt;Archbishop of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"excommunication\"&gt;excommunicated&lt;/a&gt; two police commissioners working for the regime's repressive system. &lt;a href=\"Cardinal%20%28Catholic%29\"&gt;Cardinal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paulo%20Evaristo%20Arns\"&gt;Paulo Evaristo Arns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor\"&gt;O.F.M.&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Archdiocese%20of%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo\"&gt;Archbishop of S\u00e3o Paulo&lt;/a&gt;, said that it was the arrest of Sister Maurina that led him to publicly speak out against the dictatorship.\nSome authors, such as Jacob Gorender, in his book \"Combate nas Trevas\" (\"Fighting in the Darkness\"), claim that Sister Maurina was &lt;a href=\"rape\"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt;d in prison. Sister Maurina, however, denies this claim. According to her, she was a victim of \"moral violence\", such as when she was forced to sign a document stating that she was the mistress of a &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; militant. Gordender says his claim was based on declarations made by FALN members.\nOn 1970, after five months of illegal detainment, Sister Maurina was released after she was exchanged for &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese Consul Nobuo Okuchi, kidnapped by the Vanguarda Popular Revolucion\u00e1ria (VPR). She was forced into exile on &lt;a href=\"Mexico\"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, where she lived for 14 years. There, she worked in the &lt;a href=\"State%20of%20Mexico\"&gt;State of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, assisting poor rural workers.\nAllegations of pregnancy.\nAfter the dictatorship, some sensationalistic newspapers published reports that Sister Maurina allegedly had obtained an &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; after getting &lt;a href=\"pregnant\"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; by Commissioner S\u00e9rgio Paranhos Fleury, who had raped her. These claims, though denied by both Sister Maurina and Cardinal Arns, served as the basis for the 1977 play \"Milagre na Cela\" (), written by playwright Jorge Andrade.\nThe event that generated the allegation of rape was later clarified by Sister Maurina herself. According to her, a tall, blonde officer once entered her cell and started to passionately hug her, saying that he had not seen his wife for a long time. The Sister claims that she told him to back down, and then he picked up a pistol and wanted her to hold it, in order to get her &lt;a href=\"fingerprint\"&gt;fingerprint&lt;/a&gt;s on the gun.\nFinal years.\nUntil her death in 2011, Sister Maurina continued her vocation of caring for the poor in the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality of &lt;a href=\"Catanduva\"&gt;Catanduva&lt;/a&gt;. She divided her life between religious meetings and social care work to needy children in the city, where she resided since 1984. About her torture in the past, she declared the following: \"I do not like to talk about it, I have already forgiven them all\"."
