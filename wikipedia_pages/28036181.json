    "text": "A chip fork is a small fork made from &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"plastic\"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; that is given away by &lt;a href=\"fast%20food\"&gt;fast food&lt;/a&gt; suppliers with portions of &lt;a href=\"fish%20and%20chips\"&gt;fish and chips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"french%20fries\"&gt;french fries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"currywurst\"&gt;currywurst&lt;/a&gt;, and similar, and used when eating. Chip forks are specially designed to keep eaters' fingers clean of grease, &lt;a href=\"sauce\"&gt;sauce&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mayonnaise\"&gt;mayonnaise&lt;/a&gt;, and other, while at the same time being cheap enough to be thrown away after use. Thus they spare suppliers the cost and labour of collecting and cleaning traditional forks. This fits well with the image of fast food as kinds of products to be taken away and being consumed elsewhere.\nThe usual design of chip forks has either two or three tines at one end. Their length is somewhere between 7\u00bd and 9\u00a0cm, their width between 1 and 1\u00bd cm at the widest place.\nToday, these forks have completely replaced an earlier version of chip forks from the &lt;a href=\"BeNeLux\"&gt;BeNeLux&lt;/a&gt; area which had to be cleaned and reused. Whether the throw-away version was first used in &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Netherlands\"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; is disputed.\nOther meanings.\nIn Germany, the local name \"Pommesgabel\", also \"Pommespicker\" (literally: \"Chip/French fries fork/picking device\") is a popular alternative denomination for the &lt;a href=\"mano%20cornuta\"&gt;mano cornuta&lt;/a&gt;."
