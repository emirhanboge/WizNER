    "text": "Obatala or \u201cOrisa Nla\u201d (known as Obatal\u00e1 in &lt;a href=\"Yorubaland\"&gt;Yorubaland&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; and South American Spanish and Oxal\u00e1 in &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;) is an &lt;a href=\"orisha\"&gt;orisha&lt;/a&gt;. He is believed, according to Yoruba cosmology, to be the &lt;a href=\"Sky%20father\"&gt;Sky Father&lt;/a&gt; and the creator of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; bodies, which were brought to life by the smooth breath of &lt;a href=\"Olodumare\"&gt;Olodumare&lt;/a&gt;. Obatala is the oldest of all orishas (imole). His &lt;a href=\"Great%20Wife\"&gt;principal wife&lt;/a&gt; is Yemaya according to understanding in Caribbean. However, in Yorubaland, particularly Ile-Ife, where he is believed to have lived, it is understood that he had 201 wives with his favourite consort being Yemowo.\nObatala was authorized by Olodumare to create land upon the water beneath the sky. Due to his efforts, the first Yoruba city, &lt;a href=\"Ife\"&gt;Ife&lt;/a&gt;, was founded. Obatala is Olodumare's representative on Earth and the shaper of human beings. \nAccording to the oral traditions of Ife, the mortal Obatala was the founder of and the &lt;a href=\"king\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; of Ife during its classical period. His position as the King was challenged by Oduduwa who assumed leadership of the town for a brief moment. However, Obatala was able to emerge victorious in the contest and it led to the murder of his rival &lt;a href=\"Oduduwa\"&gt;Oduduwa&lt;/a&gt; and the retrieval of his throne.\nWhile there exists an Obatala in the Yoruba pantheon. The understanding of the qualities of the Obatala god was merged into the human Obatala that ruled in Ife upon his posthumous &lt;a href=\"deification\"&gt;deification&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the human Obatala who was the king at Ife was admitted to the Yoruba &lt;a href=\"Pantheon%20%28religion%29\"&gt;pantheon&lt;/a&gt; as an aspect of the primordial divinity of the same name.\nIn Africa.\nPrimordial Obatala.\nAccording to the tenets of the &lt;a href=\"Yoruba%20religion\"&gt;Yoruba religion&lt;/a&gt;, Obatala is one of the oldest of all of the orishas and was granted authority to create the Earth. A tradition states that before he could return to heaven and report to Olodumare, &lt;a href=\"Oduduwa\"&gt;Oduduwa&lt;/a&gt; usurped his responsibility (due to Obatala's being drunk at the time). He took the satchel that Olodumare had given Obatala to aid him in creation and used it to create land on the primeval ocean. A great feud ensued between the two siblings. However, an assessment of Yoruba traditional religion shows that each of the 201 deity are understood by their descendants and adherents to have carried out the creation of the earth. This suggests beginning of the world is an aspect of Yoruba cosmogenesis associated with numerous deities in Yoruba pantheons beyond Obatala or Oduduwa.\nMortal Obatala.\n&lt;a href=\"Oba%20%28ruler%29\"&gt;Oba&lt;/a&gt; Obatala was the founder and the King of Ile-Ife, hence the appellation, Olufe. His reign was disrupted by an usurpation led by Oduduwa and his supporters such as Obameri, Obadio, Aloran, Ejio and Apata. However, Obatala was able to facilitate the death of Oduduwa and retrieve his throne as the king of Le-Ife with the assistance of his support base consisting of Oluorogbo, Orunmila, Akire, Obalufon Ogbogboinrin (Obamakin), Owa Ilare and numerous others. This is re-enacted every year in the Obatala festival in Ife and the coronation rites of Ooni which indicate Obatala\u2019s ownership of the crown, throne and authority. Ultimately, following the war between Obatala on the one hand and Oduduwa on the other, the latter lost and his support based dispersed. Thus, leading to a rotated rulership between the lineages of Obatala and Obalufon Ogbogbodinrin (Obamakin) who succeeded him. This was in effect till a coup conducted by Lajamisan, a descendant of Oranfe, disrupted the ruling structure.\nIn the Americas.\nSanter\u00eda.\nObatal\u00e1 (also known as Ochal\u00e1 or Oxal\u00e1; Orichal\u00e1 or Orixal\u00e1) is the oldest \"&lt;a href=\"orisha\"&gt;orisha&lt;/a&gt; funfun\" (\"white deity\"), referring to purity, both physically and symbolically as in the \"light\" of consciousness. In &lt;a href=\"Santer%C3%ADa\"&gt;Santer\u00eda&lt;/a&gt;, Obatal\u00e1 is syncretized with Our Lady of Mercy and &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Jesus Of Nazareth&lt;/a&gt;. Obatal\u00e1 is said to have an equal number of male paths as female paths, but more often crowns women in part because men are traditionally crowned in &lt;a href=\"If%C3%A1\"&gt;If\u00e1&lt;/a&gt; in many lineages.\nCandombl\u00e9.\nIn Candombl\u00e9, Oxal\u00e1 (Obatal\u00e1) has been syncretized with Our Lord of Bonfim; in that role, he is the patron saint of Bahia. The extensive use of white clothing, which is associated with the worship of Oxal\u00e1, has become a symbol of Candombl\u00e9 in general. Friday is the day dedicated to the worship of Oxal\u00e1. A large &lt;a href=\"syncretism\"&gt;syncretic&lt;/a&gt; religious celebration of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Nosso%20Senhor%20do%20Bonfim%20%28Salvador%29\"&gt;Festa do Bonfim&lt;/a&gt; in January in &lt;a href=\"Salvador%2C%20Brazil\"&gt;Salvador&lt;/a&gt; celebrates both Oxal\u00e1 and Our Lord of Bonfim; it includes the washing of the church steps with a special water, made with flowers.\nSnails.\nThe snail \"&lt;a href=\"Achatina%20fulica\"&gt;Achatina fulica&lt;/a&gt;\" is used for &lt;a href=\"Religion%20in%20Brazil\"&gt;religious purposes in Brazil&lt;/a&gt; as an offering to Obatala. It is seen as a substitute for the African giant snail (\"&lt;a href=\"Archachatina%20marginata\"&gt;Archachatina marginata&lt;/a&gt;\") that is used in &lt;a href=\"Yorubaland\"&gt;Yorubaland&lt;/a&gt; because they are known by the same name (\"Igbin\", also known as \"Ibi\") in both Brazil and Yorubaland.\nOfferings and Rituals.\nOfferings.\nAnimal offerings for Obatala usually consist of white hen, snake, pigeon, goat, slugs, snails, or guinea. Offerings that include alcohol, crab, or beans are not allowed. The color white is very important in the representation of Obatala, therefor food offerings consist of white rice, milk, cream, shredded coconuts, and white bread. Offerings should be bland and not consist of any spices. White clothing should be worn when celebrating Obatala and offerings should be made on clean white cloth. \nIconography.\nObatala is pictured wearing sparkling white clothes, a white crown, and a staff called an &lt;a href=\"Opaxor%C3%B4\"&gt;Opaxoro&lt;/a&gt;. This staff is generally made of wood from the atori vine. Another symbol of Obatala is the dove."
