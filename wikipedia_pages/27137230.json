    "text": "Lawrence T. Wos (1930\u20132020) was an American &lt;a href=\"mathematician\"&gt;mathematician&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher in the Mathematics and Computer Science Division of &lt;a href=\"Argonne%20National%20Laboratory\"&gt;Argonne National Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWos studied at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1950 and a master's in mathematics in 1954, and went on for doctoral studies at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana-Champaign\"&gt;University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/a&gt; where he received PhD in 1957 supervised by &lt;a href=\"Reinhold%20Baer\"&gt;Reinhold Baer&lt;/a&gt;. He joined the &lt;a href=\"Argonne%20National%20Laboratory\"&gt;Argonne&lt;/a&gt; in 1957, and began using computers to prove mathematical theorems in 1963.\nWos was congenitally &lt;a href=\"blindness\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt;. He was an avid &lt;a href=\"bowling\"&gt;bowler&lt;/a&gt;, the best male blind bowler in the US.\nAwards and honors.\nIn 1982, Wos and his colleague Steve Winker were the first to win the Automated Theorem Proving Prize, given by the &lt;a href=\"American%20Mathematical%20Society\"&gt;American Mathematical Society&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1992, Wos was the first to win the &lt;a href=\"Herbrand%20Award\"&gt;Herbrand Award&lt;/a&gt; for his contributions to the field of &lt;a href=\"automated%20deduction\"&gt;automated deduction&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"festschrift\"&gt;festschrift&lt;/a&gt; in his honor, \"Automated reasoning and its applications: essays in honor of Larry Wos\" (Robert Veroff, ed.) was published by the &lt;a href=\"MIT%20Press\"&gt;MIT Press&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 ().\nBooks.\nWos and Gail W. Pieper are the coauthors of the books \"A Fascinating Country in the World of Computing: Your Guide to Automated Reasoning\" (World Scientific, 1999, ) and \"Automated Reasoning and the Discovery of Missing and Elegant Proofs\" (Rinton Press, 2003, ). Wos's collected works were published by World Scientific in 2000, in two volumes ()."
