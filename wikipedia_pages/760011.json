    "title": "Mitsuo Matayoshi",
    "text": ", also known as or was a Japanese political activist known for his &lt;a href=\"Perennial%20candidate\"&gt;perennial candidacy&lt;/a&gt;. He was the leader and founder of the World Economic Community Party ().\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Ginowan%2C%20Okinawa\"&gt;Ginowan, Okinawa&lt;/a&gt; on February 5, 1944. After graduating from &lt;a href=\"Chuo%20University\"&gt;Chuo University&lt;/a&gt; in Tokyo in 1968, he moved back to Okinawa and ran a \"&lt;a href=\"Cram%20school\"&gt;juku&lt;/a&gt;\", a private school. Matayoshi was trained as a &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; preacher, and through his religious studies developed a particular concept of &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; strongly influenced by &lt;a href=\"eschatology\"&gt;eschatology&lt;/a&gt;. In 1997, he established the World Economic Community Party, a political party based on his conviction that he was &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;. His concept was both religious and political, a mix of &lt;a href=\"Christian%20eschatology\"&gt;Christian eschatology&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Augustine%20of%20Hippo\"&gt;Augustine&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"City%20of%20God%20%28book%29\"&gt;De civitate Dei&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"City of God\") and &lt;a href=\"Conservatism\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"collectivism\"&gt;collectivism&lt;/a&gt;. He died from illness on July 20, 2018.\nPolitical program.\nAccording to his programme he would have executed the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Judgment\"&gt;Last Judgment&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Christ\"&gt;Christ&lt;/a&gt;, but within the current political system. His first step was to have been appointed the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Prime Minister of Japan&lt;/a&gt;. Then he would have reformed Japanese society and be offered the post of the &lt;a href=\"Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations\"&gt;Secretary-General of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. Matayoshi would then have reigned over the whole world with two legitimate authorities, not only religious but also political. The world economic system would have been altered to encourage every nation to be self-sufficient, based on agriculture. He condemned &lt;a href=\"permanent%20residency\"&gt;permanent residency&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"naturalisation\"&gt;naturalisation&lt;/a&gt; of foreigners because he viewed the abandonment of one's motherland to be wrong. He wanted ethnically non-Japanese people to go back to their ancestral homeland even if they were born in Japan. He wanted the USA to withdraw its army from all overseas positions, including Okinawa. After his Judgment he would have thrown the corrupt into the Fire (see &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Revelation\"&gt;Book of Revelation&lt;/a&gt;).\nElections.\nMatayoshi presented himself as a candidate in many elections from 1997 through to 2013, despite winning none of them. He became well-known for his eccentric campaigns in which he urged opponents to commit suicide by &lt;a href=\"Seppuku\"&gt;hara-kiri&lt;/a&gt; (disembowelment; note that he avoided the more polite \"seppuku\") and said that he will cast them into &lt;a href=\"Gehenna\"&gt;Gehenna&lt;/a&gt;. Like most Japanese politicians, he campaigned in a single small regulation size &lt;a href=\"minivan\"&gt;mini-van&lt;/a&gt; fitted with oversized loudspeakers. Unlike most, however, he blasted his campaign slogans in a stylised, &lt;a href=\"kabuki\"&gt;kabuki&lt;/a&gt;-inspired voice."
