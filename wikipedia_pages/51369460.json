    "title": "1830 Central American federal election",
    "text": "After the victory of rebel liberal leader &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Moraz%C3%A1n\"&gt;Francisco Moraz\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; in 1829 by taking &lt;a href=\"Guatemala%20City\"&gt;Guatemala City&lt;/a&gt; and thus ending the Central American Civil War, Moraz\u00e1n urged the Congress for new elections. This were held in 1830.\nMain candidates were &lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Jos%C3%A9%20Cecilio%20del%20Valle\"&gt;Jos\u00e9 Cecilio del Valle&lt;/a&gt; and Moraz\u00e1n himself. After the election Moraz\u00e1n obtained 202 electoral votes and Valle 103, still less than required for both to win according to the Constitution (same that happened in the &lt;a href=\"1825%20Central%20American%20federal%20election\"&gt;1825 election&lt;/a&gt;) though this time the liberal-dominated Congress chose to respect the popular vote, which favoured Moraz\u00e1n, proclaiming him president for a four-year term. Valle accepted the results."
