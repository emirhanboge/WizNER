His Japanese decorations included &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Kite\"&gt;Order of the Golden Kite&lt;/a&gt; (1st class) and &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Chrysanthemum\"&gt;Order of the Chrysanthemum&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nHasegawa was born as the son of a &lt;a href=\"samurai\"&gt;samurai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kenjutsu\"&gt;fencing&lt;/a&gt; master in the &lt;a href=\"Iwakuni\"&gt;Iwakuni&lt;/a&gt; sub-fief of &lt;a href=\"Nagato%20Province\"&gt;Ch\u014dsh\u016b&lt;/a&gt; (present-day &lt;a href=\"Yamaguchi%20Prefecture\"&gt;Yamaguchi Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;), Hasegawa served under the Ch\u014dsh\u016b forces during the &lt;a href=\"Boshin%20War\"&gt;Boshin War&lt;/a&gt; from January until March 1868 during the &lt;a href=\"Meiji%20Restoration\"&gt;Meiji Restoration&lt;/a&gt; which overthrew the &lt;a href=\"Tokugawa%20shogunate\"&gt;Tokugawa shogunate&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Army\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Army&lt;/a&gt; in 1871, Hasegawa was commissioned a &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28land%20and%20air%29\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;. Later, as a &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt;, he was given command of a &lt;a href=\"regiment\"&gt;regiment&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Satsuma%20Rebellion\"&gt;Satsuma Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, and saw action at the relief of &lt;a href=\"Kumamoto%20Castle\"&gt;Kumamoto Castle&lt;/a&gt; on 14 April 1877.\nHe traveled to &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"military%20attach%C3%A9\"&gt;military attach\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; in 1885 to study European &lt;a href=\"military%20strategy\"&gt;military strategy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"military%20tactics\"&gt;military tactics&lt;/a&gt; and equipment. Upon his return to Japan the following year, Hasegawa was promoted to &lt;a href=\"major%20general\"&gt;major general&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20Sino-Japanese%20War\"&gt;First Sino-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt;, Hasegawa won distinction for valor on behalf of his 12th Infantry Brigade at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pyongyang%20%281894%29\"&gt;Battle of Pyongyang&lt;/a&gt; on 15 September 1894 and in skirmishes around &lt;a href=\"Haicheng%2C%20Liaoning\"&gt;Haicheng&lt;/a&gt; from December 1894 until January 1895. After the war, he was ennobled with the title of \"danshaku\" (&lt;a href=\"baron\"&gt;baron&lt;/a&gt;) under the \"&lt;a href=\"kazoku\"&gt;kazoku&lt;/a&gt;\" peerage system.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Russo-Japanese%20War\"&gt;Russo-Japanese War&lt;/a&gt;, Hasegawa was assigned to the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20First%20Army\"&gt;First Army&lt;/a&gt; under General &lt;a href=\"Kuroki%20Tamemoto\"&gt;Kuroki Tamemoto&lt;/a&gt; as commander of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Imperial Guards Division&lt;/a&gt; in the spring of 1904. He later fought with distinction at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Yalu%20River%20%281904%29\"&gt;Battle of the Yalu&lt;/a&gt; on 30 April\u00a0\u2013 1 May 1904, and was soon after promoted to &lt;a href=\"general\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt; in June 1904.\nHe was commander of the &lt;a href=\"Chosen%20Army\"&gt;Korea Garrison Army&lt;/a&gt; from September 1904 until December 1908. In 1907, Hasegawa was elevated to the title of \"shishaku\" (&lt;a href=\"viscount\"&gt;viscount&lt;/a&gt;). Hasegawa was appointed &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Staff\"&gt;Chief of Staff&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%20General%20Staff\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Army General Staff&lt;/a&gt; in 1912. He forced &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20War%20of%20Japan\"&gt;War Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uehara%20Y%C5%ABsaku\"&gt;Uehara Y\u016bsaku&lt;/a&gt; to resign over &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Japan\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saionji%20Kinmochi\"&gt;Saionji Kinmochi&lt;/a&gt;'s tight fiscal policy and attempted revision of the system whereby only active duty officers would be able to serve as Ministers of War and Navy. The collapse of Saionji\u2019s government was known as the \"Taish\u014d Political Crisis\".\nIn 1915, Hasegawa was awarded the title of &lt;a href=\"Field%20Marshal%20%28Japan%29\"&gt;field marshal&lt;/a&gt;, and was elevated to the title of \"hakushaku\" (&lt;a href=\"count\"&gt;count&lt;/a&gt;) in 1916. From October 1916, he served as the second &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Governor-General%20of%20Korea\"&gt;Japanese Governor-General of Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and was later criticized for his military approach to the &lt;a href=\"March%201st%20Movement\"&gt;Samil Independence Movement&lt;/a&gt;.\nHasegawa died in 1924. His grave is at &lt;a href=\"Aoyama%20Cemetery\"&gt;Aoyama Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aoyama%2C%20Minato%2C%20Tokyo\"&gt;Aoyama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minato%2C%20Tokyo\"&gt;Minato&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;."
