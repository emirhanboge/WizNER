It was established in 1920 in Baku and was previously known as the Hajibeyov Azerbaijan State Conservatoire.\nHistory.\nIn 1920, Azerbaijani composer &lt;a href=\"Uzeyir%20Hajibeyov\"&gt;Uzeyir Hajibeyov&lt;/a&gt; began a movement aimed at propagating classical music among the people. His report presented at the Azerbaijani People's Commissariat of Education (early Soviet analogue of a &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20%28government%20department%29\"&gt;Ministry&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Education\"&gt;Education&lt;/a&gt;) offering the establishment of a high-level music education institution resulted in the approval of his proposal. Thus, the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire was founded on 25 May 1920. Hajibeyov became one of its first instructors. In the 1920s, he established the Oriental Department, where Azeri folk music was taught both traditionally (orally) and by European methods, i.e., using &lt;a href=\"Musical%20note\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;s. Along with composer &lt;a href=\"Muslim%20Magomayev%20%28composer%29\"&gt;Muslim Magomayev&lt;/a&gt;, he developed the textbook \"Azeri Folk Songs\" published in 1927. In 1939, Hajibeyov was made head of the Conservatoire.\nIn 1930, the &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Thaddeus%20and%20Bartholomew%20Cathedral\"&gt;Saint Thaddeus and Bartholomew Armenian Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; of Baku was demolished as part of the early Soviet atheist policy to make way for the construction of the new academy building.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, the conservatoire executives organized hundreds of concerts for military units and soldiers who recovered in hospitals. It was enhanced with the Bulbul Specialized Secondary Music School in 1931, the Music Studio School in 1980, and the Mammadova Opera Studio in 1984.\nIn 1991, it was renamed Hajibeyov Baku Academy of Music.\nAcademics.\nThere are three faculties and 18 departments. The academy offers graduating students &lt;a href=\"master%27s%20degree\"&gt;master's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kandidat\"&gt;kandidat's&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"doctorate%20degree\"&gt;doctorate degree&lt;/a&gt;s. There are two research laboratories \u2014 the Restoration and Improvement of Ancient Musical Instruments Laboratory established in 1991 and the Investigation of Professional Oral Music Traditions Laboratory, established in 1992."
