    "text": "The International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY) is an international &lt;a href=\"liberalism\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; youth organization. It consists of a global membership of national youth organizations. These are often but not exclusively affiliated with &lt;a href=\"political%20parties\"&gt;political parties&lt;/a&gt; that are members of &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20International\"&gt;Liberal International&lt;/a&gt;.\nIFLRY holds full member status to Liberal International and the &lt;a href=\"European%20Youth%20Forum\"&gt;European Youth Forum&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"YFJ\"&gt;YFJ&lt;/a&gt;), which operates within the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Europe\"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; areas and works closely with both these bodies. Since 2014, IFLRY has held special consultative status to &lt;a href=\"ECOSOC\"&gt;ECOSOC&lt;/a&gt;. IFLRY also holds observer status to &lt;a href=\"UNFCCC\"&gt;UNFCCC&lt;/a&gt; and has sent delegations to &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20conference\"&gt;COP&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=\"2009%20United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference\"&gt;COP15&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Copenhagen\"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; in 2009.\nHistory.\nIFLRY continues the tradition of two predecessors. The first was the &lt;a href=\"World%20Federation%20of%20Liberal%20and%20Radical%20Youth\"&gt;World Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth&lt;/a&gt; (WFLRY), founded in 1947 in &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. WFLRY aimed to be a global organization, but mostly had active members in Europe. This led in 1969 to the separate forming of the &lt;a href=\"European%20Federation%20of%20Liberal%20and%20Radical%20Youth\"&gt;European Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth&lt;/a&gt; (EFLRY). WFLRY was dissolved in 1978.\nIn 1979, at the EFLRY 6th Congress in &lt;a href=\"Silkeborg\"&gt;Silkeborg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, EFLRY renamed itself IFLRY International Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth. This marked the start of a global expansion of the organization. The 6th Congress is thus recognized as the founding congress of IFLRY.\nIn 2001, the organization was renamed into IFLRY \u2013 International Federation of Liberal Youth.\nStructure.\nIFLRY's highest body is the General Assembly, which meets at least every year. It adopts IFLRY's political platform, the Manifesto, and decides about IFLRY's activities. These are stated in a two-year Programme of Action. The General Assembly also decides on the federation's policies by adopting resolutions. Furthermore, the General Assembly elects the Bureau and decides upon the budget.\nThe Executive Committee is composed of one representative from each member organisation and the Bureau. It meets twice a year and takes all policy decisions within the framework of the General Assembly's resolutions.\nThe IFLRY Bureau consists of a President, a Secretary General, a Treasurer and four Vice-Presidents. The Bureau has the responsibility for IFLRY's day-to-day management and is elected every two years. The IFLRY Bureau appoints an Executive Director who runs the IFLRY secretariat in Berlin.\nBureau 2021-2022.\nRegional board members:\nProgrammes.\nA major part of the activities within IFLRY are organized through various programmes. These are the current IFLRY programmes:\nMember organizations.\nNational organizations.\nOceania.\nNo national member organizations at the moment."
