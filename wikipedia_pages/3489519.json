    "text": "P. Krishna Pillai (\u0d2a\u0d3f. \u0d15\u0d43\u0d37\u0d4d\u0d23\u0d2a\u0d3f\u0d33\u0d4d\u0d33 in &lt;a href=\"Malayalam\"&gt;Malayalam&lt;/a&gt;) (19 August 1906 at &lt;a href=\"Vaikom\"&gt;Vaikom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kottayam%20District\"&gt;Kottayam&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 19 August 1948 at &lt;a href=\"Muhamma\"&gt;Muhamma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alappuzha%20District\"&gt;Alleppey&lt;/a&gt;) was a &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; revolutionary from &lt;a href=\"Kerala\"&gt;Kerala&lt;/a&gt;, India. He was one of the founding leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India\"&gt;Communist Party of India&lt;/a&gt; in Kerala, and a poet.\nEarly life.\nP. Krishna Pillai was born in a middle-class &lt;a href=\"Nair\"&gt;Nair&lt;/a&gt; family of &lt;a href=\"Vaikom\"&gt;Vaikom&lt;/a&gt; as the son of Narayanan Nair and Parvathi Amma. He lost both his parents at an early age and consequently had to drop out of school at the fifth grade. Leaving his home in 1920, he travelled extensively in the north of the Indian subcontinent.\nWhen he returned home two years later, he found Kerala seething with social unrest. Subsequently, he took part in a number of popular movements. He was an active volunteer of &lt;a href=\"Vaikom%20Satyagraha\"&gt;Vaikom Satyagraha&lt;/a&gt; (1924) and &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Satyagraha\"&gt;Salt Satyagraha&lt;/a&gt; march from &lt;a href=\"Kozhikode\"&gt;Kozhikode&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Payyanur\"&gt;Payyanur&lt;/a&gt; (1930). In 1931 he became the first non Namputhiri Brahmin (he was from Nair Community of Kerala) to ring the temple bell of the &lt;a href=\"Guruvayoor\"&gt;Guruvayoor&lt;/a&gt; temple.\nPolitical life.\nKrishna Pillai who began his political life as a &lt;a href=\"Gandhian\"&gt;Gandhian&lt;/a&gt; and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20National%20Congress\"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt; in his early youth had gradually transformed into a socialist with communist leanings. And when in 1934 Congress Socialist workers formed the &lt;a href=\"Congress%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Congress Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bombay\"&gt;Bombay&lt;/a&gt;, Krishna Pillai was appointed its secretary in Kerala, all the while functioning under the banner of the Indian National Congress.\nBy 1936, Krishna Pillai who until then had concentrated his political activities to the &lt;a href=\"Malabar%20district\"&gt;Malabar&lt;/a&gt; region now campaigned in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Cochin\"&gt;Cochin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Travancore\"&gt;Travancore&lt;/a&gt;. In 1938, he organized the famous worker's strike in &lt;a href=\"Alappuzha\"&gt;Alappuzha&lt;/a&gt; (Alleppey), which turned out to be a great success and one of the inspiring factors behind the &lt;a href=\"Punnapra-Vayalar%20Struggle\"&gt;Punnapra-Vayalar Struggle&lt;/a&gt; of 1946 and the eventual downfall of the rule of &lt;a href=\"C.%20P.%20Ramaswami%20Iyer\"&gt;C. P. Ramaswami Iyer&lt;/a&gt; in Travancore.\nThe successful transformation of the Malabar unit of the Congress Socialist Party into the Kerala unit of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20India\"&gt;Communist Party of India&lt;/a&gt; (CPI) was mainly due to the untiring work of Krishna Pillai. The formal formation of the CPI unit in Kerala was on 26 January 1940. Years later in 1948 when the CPI accepted the &lt;a href=\"Calcutta%20Thesis\"&gt;Calcutta Thesis&lt;/a&gt; which included in it the express need for an armed struggle against the Indian state, CPI faced a nationwide ban and most of its leaders including Krishna Pillai were forced into hiding.\nDeath.\nWhile hiding in a worker's hut in &lt;a href=\"Muhamma\"&gt;Muhamma&lt;/a&gt;, Krishna Pillai sustained a snakebite and succumbed to it, aged just 42.\nPersonal life.\nP. Krishna Pillai's role in building the Communist party in Kerala is second to none. He was a great organizer who succeeded in reaching out to the oppressed masses of Kerala and making them aware of their rights and the need for uplifting their social and economic conditions of life. His dedication to the &lt;a href=\"Communist\"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; party could be understood from a short sentence by which he proposed marriage to his prospective wife Thankamma. Krishna Pillai said: \"Life with me will be difficult, different. My wife should stand by me, the party and its cause. Then alone will she be happy\".\nIn popular culture.\n&lt;a href=\"Samuthirakani\"&gt;Samuthirakani&lt;/a&gt; portrays Pillai in the 2014 film \"&lt;a href=\"Vasanthathinte%20Kanal%20Vazhikalil\"&gt;Vasanthathinte Kanal Vazhikalil&lt;/a&gt;\"."
