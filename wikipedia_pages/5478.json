    "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR; ; , RCA; , or , ) is a &lt;a href=\"landlocked%20country\"&gt;landlocked country&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Africa\"&gt;Central Africa&lt;/a&gt;. It is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Chad\"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic%E2%80%93Chad%20border\"&gt;the north&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sudan\"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic%E2%80%93Sudan%20border\"&gt;the northeast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Sudan\"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic%E2%80%93South%20Sudan%20border\"&gt;the southeast&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;DR Congo&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic%E2%80%93Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%20border\"&gt;the south&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic%E2%80%93Republic%20of%20the%20Congo%20border\"&gt;the southwest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cameroon\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Cameroon%E2%80%93Central%20African%20Republic%20border\"&gt;the west&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Central African Republic covers a land area of about . , it had an estimated population of around million. , the Central African Republic is the scene of a &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war, ongoing since 2012&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of the Central African Republic consists of Sudano-Guinean &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;s, but the country also includes a &lt;a href=\"Sahel\"&gt;Sahel&lt;/a&gt;o-&lt;a href=\"East%20Sudanian%20savanna\"&gt;Sudanian&lt;/a&gt; zone in the north and an &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Congolian%20forest-savanna%20mosaic\"&gt;equatorial forest zone&lt;/a&gt; in the south. Two-thirds of the country is within the &lt;a href=\"Ubangi%20River\"&gt;Ubangi River&lt;/a&gt; basin (which flows into the &lt;a href=\"Congo%20River\"&gt;Congo&lt;/a&gt;), while the remaining third lies in the basin of the &lt;a href=\"Chari%20River\"&gt;Chari&lt;/a&gt;, which flows into &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Chad\"&gt;Lake Chad&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat is today the Central African Republic has been inhabited for millennia; however, the country's current borders were established by &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, which ruled the country as a colony starting in the late 19th century. After gaining independence from France in 1960, the Central African Republic was ruled by a series of autocratic leaders, including an &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Empire\"&gt;abortive attempt at a monarchy&lt;/a&gt;. \nBy the 1990s, calls for democracy led to the first multi-party democratic elections in 1993. &lt;a href=\"Ange-F%C3%A9lix%20Patass%C3%A9\"&gt;Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; became president, but was later removed by &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Boziz%C3%A9\"&gt;General Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20Central%20African%20Republic%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;2003 coup&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic%20Bush%20War\"&gt;Central African Republic Bush War&lt;/a&gt; began in 2004 and, despite a peace treaty in 2007 and another in 2011, civil war resumed in 2012. The civil war perpetuated the country's poor &lt;a href=\"Human%20rights%20in%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic\"&gt;human rights record&lt;/a&gt;: it was characterized by widespread and increasing abuses by various participating armed groups, such as arbitrary imprisonment, torture, and restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom of movement.\n&lt;a href=\"Resource%20curse\"&gt;Despite&lt;/a&gt; its significant &lt;a href=\"mineral\"&gt;mineral&lt;/a&gt; deposits and other resources, such as &lt;a href=\"uranium\"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt; reserves, &lt;a href=\"crude%20oil\"&gt;crude oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cobalt\"&gt;cobalt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"hydropower\"&gt;hydropower&lt;/a&gt;, as well as significant quantities of &lt;a href=\"arable%20land\"&gt;arable land&lt;/a&gt;, the Central African Republic is among the ten poorest countries in the world, with the lowest &lt;a href=\"Gross%20domestic%20product\"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt; per capita at purchasing power parity in the world as of 2017. , according to the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Development%20Index\"&gt;Human Development Index&lt;/a&gt; (HDI), the country had the second-lowest level of human development (only ahead of &lt;a href=\"Niger\"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;), ranking 188 out of 189 countries. The country had the lowest &lt;a href=\"inequality-adjusted%20Human%20Development%20Index\"&gt;inequality-adjusted Human Development Index&lt;/a&gt; (IHDI), ranking 150th out of 150 countries. The Central African Republic is also estimated to be the unhealthiest country as well as the worst country in which to be young. \nThe Central African Republic is a member of the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"African%20Union\"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Economic%20Community%20of%20Central%20African%20States\"&gt;Economic Community of Central African States&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Organisation%20internationale%20de%20la%20Francophonie\"&gt;Organisation internationale de la Francophonie&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Non-Aligned%20Movement\"&gt;Non-Aligned Movement&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThe name of the Central African Republic is derived from the country's geographical location in the central region of Africa and its republic form of government. From 1976 to 1979, the country was known as the Central African Empire. During the colonial era, the country's name was Ubangi-Shari which is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Ubangi%20River\"&gt;Ubangi River&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chari%20River\"&gt;Chari River&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nApproximately 10,000 years ago, &lt;a href=\"desertification\"&gt;desertification&lt;/a&gt; forced hunter-gatherer societies south into the Sahel regions of northern Central Africa, where some groups settled. Farming began as part of the &lt;a href=\"Neolithic%20Revolution\"&gt;Neolithic Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Initial farming of &lt;a href=\"Dioscorea%20rotundata\"&gt;white yam&lt;/a&gt; progressed into &lt;a href=\"millet\"&gt;millet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sorghum\"&gt;sorghum&lt;/a&gt;, and before 3000 BCE the domestication of &lt;a href=\"Elaeis%20guineensis\"&gt;African oil palm&lt;/a&gt; improved the groups' nutrition and allowed for expansion of the local populations. This Agricultural Revolution, combined with a \"Fish-stew Revolution\", in which fishing began to take place, and the use of boats, allowed for the transportation of goods. Products were often moved in &lt;a href=\"ceramic\"&gt;ceramic&lt;/a&gt; pots, which are the first known examples of &lt;a href=\"artistic%20expression\"&gt;artistic expression&lt;/a&gt; from the region's inhabitants.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bouar\"&gt;Bouar Megaliths&lt;/a&gt; in the western region of the country indicate an advanced level of habitation dating back to the very late &lt;a href=\"Neolithic\"&gt;Neolithic Era&lt;/a&gt; (c. 3500\u20132700 BCE). &lt;a href=\"Ferrous%20metallurgy\"&gt;Ironworking&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the region around 1000 BCE.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Azande%20people\"&gt;Azande people&lt;/a&gt; settled along the &lt;a href=\"Ubangi%20River\"&gt;Ubangi River&lt;/a&gt; in what is today Central and East Central African Republic while &lt;a href=\"Bantoid\"&gt;Bantoid&lt;/a&gt; peoples migrated from the southwest from Cameroon.\n&lt;a href=\"Banana\"&gt;Banana&lt;/a&gt;s arrived in the region during the first millennium BCE and added an important source of carbohydrates to the diet; they were also used in the production of &lt;a href=\"alcoholic%20beverages\"&gt;alcoholic beverages&lt;/a&gt;. Production of &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salt\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dried%20fish\"&gt;dried fish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"textiles\"&gt;textiles&lt;/a&gt; dominated the economic trade in the Central African region.\n16th\u201319th century.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries &lt;a href=\"slave%20trade\"&gt;slave trade&lt;/a&gt;rs began to raid the region as part of the expansion of the Saharan and Nile River slave routes. Their captives were enslaved and shipped to the Mediterranean coast, Europe, Arabia, the Western Hemisphere, or to the slave ports and factories along the West and North Africa or South along the Ubanqui and Congo rivers. In the mid 19th century, the &lt;a href=\"Bangi%20language\"&gt;Bobangi people&lt;/a&gt; became major slave traders and sold their captives to the Americas using the Ubangi river to reach the coast. During the 18th century Bandia-Nzakara &lt;a href=\"Azande\"&gt;Azande&lt;/a&gt; peoples established the &lt;a href=\"Bangassou\"&gt;Bangassou&lt;/a&gt; Kingdom along the &lt;a href=\"Ubangi%20River\"&gt;Ubangi River&lt;/a&gt;. In 1875, the &lt;a href=\"Sudan\"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;ese sultan &lt;a href=\"Rabih%20az-Zubayr\"&gt;Rabih az-Zubayr&lt;/a&gt; governed Upper-Oubangui, which included present-day Central African Republic.\nFrench colonial period.\nThe European invasion of Central African territory began in the late 19th century during the &lt;a href=\"Scramble%20for%20Africa\"&gt;Scramble for Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Europeans, primarily the French, &lt;a href=\"Germans\"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Belgians\"&gt;Belgians&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in the area in 1885. France seized and colonized &lt;a href=\"Ubangi-Shari\"&gt;Ubangi-Shari&lt;/a&gt; territory in 1894. In 1911 at the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Fez\"&gt;Treaty of Fez&lt;/a&gt;, France ceded a nearly 300,000\u00a0km2 portion of the Sangha and Lobaye basins to the &lt;a href=\"German%20Empire\"&gt;German Empire&lt;/a&gt; which ceded a smaller area (in present-day &lt;a href=\"Chad\"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;) to France. After &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; France again annexed the territory. Modeled on &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20II%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;King Leopold&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Congo%20Free%20State\"&gt;Congo Free State&lt;/a&gt;, concessions were doled out to private companies that endeavored to strip the region's assets as quickly and cheaply as possible before depositing a percentage of their profits into the French treasury. The concessionary companies &lt;a href=\"corv%C3%A9e\"&gt;forced local people&lt;/a&gt; to harvest rubber, coffee, and other commodities without pay and held their families hostage until they met their quotas. Between 1890, a year after the French first arrived, and 1940, the population declined by half due to diseases, famine and exploitation by private companies.\nIn 1920 &lt;a href=\"French%20Equatorial%20Africa\"&gt;French Equatorial Africa&lt;/a&gt; was established and Ubangi-Shari was administered from &lt;a href=\"Brazzaville\"&gt;Brazzaville&lt;/a&gt;. During the 1920s and 1930s the French introduced a policy of mandatory cotton cultivation, a network of roads was built, attempts were made to combat &lt;a href=\"African%20trypanosomiasis\"&gt;sleeping sickness&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Protestant\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mission%20%28Christianity%29\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; were established to spread Christianity. New forms of forced labor were also introduced and a large number of Ubangians were sent to work on the &lt;a href=\"Congo-Ocean%20Railway\"&gt;Congo-Ocean Railway&lt;/a&gt;. Through the period of construction until 1934 there was a continual heavy cost in human lives, with total deaths among all workers along the railway estimated in excess of 17,000 of the construction workers, from a combination of both industrial accidents and diseases including &lt;a href=\"malaria\"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;. In 1928, a major insurrection, the &lt;a href=\"Kongo-Wara%20rebellion\"&gt;Kongo-Wara rebellion&lt;/a&gt; or 'war of the hoe handle', broke out in Western Ubangi-Shari and continued for several years. The extent of this insurrection, which was perhaps the largest anti-colonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years, was carefully hidden from the French public because it provided evidence of strong opposition to French colonial rule and forced labor.\nIn September 1940, during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20de%20Gaulle\"&gt;pro-Gaullist&lt;/a&gt; French officers took control of Ubangi-Shari and &lt;a href=\"General%20Leclerc\"&gt;General Leclerc&lt;/a&gt; established his headquarters for the &lt;a href=\"Free%20French%20Forces\"&gt;Free French Forces&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bangui\"&gt;Bangui&lt;/a&gt;. In 1946 &lt;a href=\"Barth%C3%A9lemy%20Boganda\"&gt;Barth\u00e9lemy Boganda&lt;/a&gt; was elected with 9,000 votes to the &lt;a href=\"French%20National%20Assembly\"&gt;French National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first representative of the Central African Republic in the French government. Boganda maintained a political stance against racism and the colonial regime but gradually became disheartened with the French political system and returned to the Central African Republic to establish the &lt;a href=\"Movement%20for%20the%20Social%20Evolution%20of%20Black%20Africa\"&gt;Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa&lt;/a&gt; (\"Mouvement pour l'\u00e9volution sociale de l'Afrique noire\", MESAN) in 1950.\nSince independence (1960\u2013present).\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1957%20Ubangi-Shari%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;Ubangi-Shari Territorial Assembly election&lt;/a&gt; in 1957, MESAN captured 347,000 out of the total 356,000 votes and won every legislative seat, which led to Boganda being elected president of the Grand Council of &lt;a href=\"French%20Equatorial%20Africa\"&gt;French Equatorial Africa&lt;/a&gt; and vice-president of the Ubangi-Shari Government Council. Within a year, he declared the establishment of the Central African Republic and served as the country's first prime minister. MESAN continued to exist, but its role was limited. The Central Africa Republic was granted 'independence' within the French Community in 1 December 1958, a status which meant it was still counted as part of the French Empire in Africa. \nAfter Boganda's death in a plane crash on 29 March 1959, his cousin, &lt;a href=\"David%20Dacko\"&gt;David Dacko&lt;/a&gt;, took control of MESAN. Dacko became the country's first president when the Central African Republic formally received &lt;a href=\"independence\"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt; from France at midnight on 13 August 1960, a date celebrated by the country's &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20national%20independence%20days\"&gt;Independence Day&lt;/a&gt; holiday. Dacko threw out his political rivals, including &lt;a href=\"Abel%20Goumba\"&gt;Abel Goumba&lt;/a&gt;, former Prime Minister and leader of &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Evolution%20Movement%20of%20Central%20Africa\"&gt;Mouvement d'\u00e9volution d\u00e9mocratique de l'Afrique centrale&lt;/a&gt; (MEDAC), whom he forced into exile in France. With all opposition parties suppressed by November 1962, Dacko declared MESAN as the official party of the state.\nBokassa and the Central African Empire (1965\u20131979).\nOn 31 December 1965, Dacko was overthrown in the &lt;a href=\"Saint-Sylvestre%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;Saint-Sylvestre coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt; by Colonel &lt;a href=\"Jean-B%C3%A9del%20Bokassa\"&gt;Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa&lt;/a&gt;, who suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly. President Bokassa declared himself President for Life in 1972 and named himself Emperor Bokassa I of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Empire\"&gt;Central African Empire&lt;/a&gt; (as the country was renamed) on 4 December 1976. A year later, Emperor Bokassa crowned himself in a lavish and expensive ceremony that was ridiculed by much of the world.\nIn April 1979, young students protested against Bokassa's decree that all school attendees would need to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives. The government violently suppressed the protests, killing 100 children and teenagers. Bokassa himself may have been personally involved in some of the killings. In September 1979, &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Barracuda\"&gt;France overthrew Bokassa&lt;/a&gt; and restored Dacko to power (subsequently restoring the name of the country and the original government to the Central African Republic). Dacko, in turn, was again overthrown in a &lt;a href=\"1981%20Central%20African%20Republic%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt; by General &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Kolingba\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Kolingba&lt;/a&gt; on 1 September 1981.\nCentral African Republic under Kolingba.\nKolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a military junta until 1985. He introduced a new constitution in 1986 which was adopted by a nationwide referendum. Membership in his new party, the &lt;a href=\"Rassemblement%20D%C3%A9mocratique%20Centrafricain\"&gt;Rassemblement D\u00e9mocratique Centrafricain&lt;/a&gt; (RDC), was voluntary. In 1987 and 1988, semi-free elections to parliament were held, but Kolingba's two major political opponents, &lt;a href=\"Abel%20Goumba\"&gt;Abel Goumba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ange-F%C3%A9lix%20Patass%C3%A9\"&gt;Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, were not allowed to participate.\nBy 1990, inspired by the fall of the Berlin Wall, a pro-democracy movement arose. Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the US, Germany, Japan, the EU, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Bank\"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, and the UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs. After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a \"Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la R\u00e9publique\" (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a \"Mixed Electoral Commission\", which included representatives from all political parties.\nWhen a second round of elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community coordinated by GIBAFOR, Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9 won in the second round of voting with 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Patass\u00e9's party, the \"Mouvement pour la Lib\u00e9ration du Peuple Centrafricain\" (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament, which meant Patass\u00e9's party required coalition partners.\nPatass\u00e9 government (1993\u20132003).\nPatass\u00e9 purged many of the Kolingba elements from the government and Kolingba supporters accused Patass\u00e9's government of conducting a \"witch hunt\" against the Yakoma. A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 but had little impact on the country's politics. In 1996\u20131997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patass\u00e9's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. During this time (1996) the Peace Corps evacuated all its volunteers to neighboring Cameroon. To date, the Peace Corps has not returned to the Central African Republic. The &lt;a href=\"Bangui%20Agreements\"&gt;Bangui Agreements&lt;/a&gt;, signed in January 1997, provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, to Central African Republic and re-entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The inter-African military mission was later replaced by a U.N. &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201159\"&gt;peacekeeping force (MINURCA)&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1997, the country has hosted almost a dozen peacekeeping interventions, earning it the title of \"world champion of peacekeeping\".\nIn 1998, parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba's RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats. The next year, however, in spite of widespread public anger in urban centers over his corrupt rule, Patass\u00e9 won a second term in the presidential election.\nOn 28 May 2001, rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an &lt;a href=\"2001%20Central%20African%20Republic%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempt\"&gt;unsuccessful coup attempt&lt;/a&gt;. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General Fran\u00e7ois N'Djadder Bedaya were killed, but Patass\u00e9 regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Congolese&lt;/a&gt; rebel leader &lt;a href=\"Jean-Pierre%20Bemba\"&gt;Jean-Pierre Bemba&lt;/a&gt; and Libyan soldiers.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"2001%20Central%20African%20Republic%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempt\"&gt;failed coup&lt;/a&gt;, militias loyal to Patass\u00e9 sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of &lt;a href=\"Bangui\"&gt;Bangui&lt;/a&gt; and incited unrest including the murder of many political opponents. Eventually, Patass\u00e9 came to suspect that General &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Boziz%C3%A9\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; was involved in another coup attempt against him, which led Boziz\u00e9 to flee with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Boziz\u00e9 launched a surprise attack against Patass\u00e9, who was out of the country. Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels and Boziz\u00e9's forces succeeded in overthrowing Patass\u00e9.\nCivil wars.\n&lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Boziz%C3%A9\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; suspended the constitution and named a new cabinet, which included most opposition parties. &lt;a href=\"Abel%20Goumba\"&gt;Abel Goumba&lt;/a&gt; was named vice-president, which gave Boziz\u00e9's new government a positive image. Boziz\u00e9 established a broad-based National Transition Council to draft a new constitution, and announced that he would step down and run for office once the new constitution was approved.\nIn 2004, the &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic%20Bush%20War\"&gt;Central African Republic Bush War&lt;/a&gt; began, as forces opposed to Boziz\u00e9 took up arms against his government. In May 2005, Boziz\u00e9 won the presidential election, which excluded Patass\u00e9, and in 2006 fighting continued between the government and the rebels. In November 2006, Boziz\u00e9's government requested French military support to help them repel rebels who had taken control of towns in the country's northern regions.\nThough the initial public details of the agreement pertained to logistics and intelligence, by December the French assistance included airstrikes by &lt;a href=\"Dassault%20Mirage%202000\"&gt;Dassault Mirage 2000&lt;/a&gt; fighters against rebel positions.\nThe Syrte Agreement in February and the Birao Peace Agreement in April 2007 called for a cessation of hostilities, the billeting of &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Front%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20People\"&gt;FDPC&lt;/a&gt; fighters and their integration with FACA, the liberation of political prisoners, integration of FDPC into government, an amnesty for the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Democratic%20Forces%20for%20Unity\"&gt;UFDR&lt;/a&gt;, its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the national army. Several groups continued to fight but other groups signed on to the agreement, or similar agreements with the government (e.g. UFR on 15 December 2008). The only major group not to sign an agreement at the time was the &lt;a href=\"Convention%20of%20Patriots%20for%20Justice%20and%20Peace\"&gt;CPJP&lt;/a&gt;, which continued its activities and signed a peace agreement with the government on 25 August 2012.\nIn 2011, Boziz\u00e9 was reelected in an election which was widely considered fraudulent.\nIn November 2012, &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A9l%C3%A9ka\"&gt;S\u00e9l\u00e9ka&lt;/a&gt;, a coalition of rebel groups, took over towns in the northern and central regions of the country. These groups eventually reached a peace deal with the Boziz\u00e9's government in January 2013 involving a power sharing government but this deal broke down and the rebels seized the capital in March 2013 and Boziz\u00e9 fled the country.\n&lt;a href=\"Michel%20Djotodia\"&gt;Michel Djotodia&lt;/a&gt; took over as president. Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20Tiangaye\"&gt;Nicolas Tiangaye&lt;/a&gt; requested a &lt;a href=\"UN\"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; peacekeeping force from the &lt;a href=\"UN%20Security%20Council\"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; and on 31 May former President Boziz\u00e9 was indicted for crimes against humanity and incitement of genocide.\nBy the end of the year there were international warnings of a \"genocide\" and fighting was largely from reprisal attacks on civilians from Seleka's predominantly Muslim fighters and Christian militias called \"&lt;a href=\"anti-balaka\"&gt;anti-balaka&lt;/a&gt;.\" By August 2013, there were reports of over 200,000 &lt;a href=\"internally%20displaced%20persons\"&gt;internally displaced persons&lt;/a&gt; (IDPs)\n&lt;a href=\"President%20of%20France\"&gt;French President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&lt;/a&gt; called on the &lt;a href=\"UN%20Security%20Council\"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"African%20Union\"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; to increase their efforts to stabilize the country. On 18 February 2014, &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Secretary-General &lt;a href=\"Ban%20Ki-moon\"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; called on the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Security%20Council\"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; to immediately deploy 3,000 troops to the country, bolstering the 6,000 African Union soldiers and 2,000 French troops already in the country, to combat civilians being murdered in large numbers. The \"S\u00e9l\u00e9ka\" government was said to be divided, and in September 2013, Djotodia officially disbanded Seleka, but many rebels refused to disarm, becoming known as ex-Seleka, and veered further out of government control. It is argued that the focus of the initial disarmament efforts exclusively on the Seleka inadvertently handed the anti-Balaka the upper hand, leading to the forced displacement of Muslim civilians by anti-Balaka in Bangui and western Central African Republic.\nOn 11 January 2014, Michael Djotodia and Nicolas Tiengaye resigned as part of a deal negotiated at a regional summit in neighboring &lt;a href=\"Chad\"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20Samba-Panza\"&gt;Catherine Samba-Panza&lt;/a&gt; was elected as interim president by the National Transitional Council, becoming the first ever female Central African president. On 23 July 2014, following Congolese mediation efforts, S\u00e9l\u00e9ka and anti-balaka representatives signed a ceasefire agreement in &lt;a href=\"Brazzaville\"&gt;Brazzaville&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of 2014, the country was de facto partitioned with the anti-Balaka in the southwest and ex-Seleka in the northeast. In March 2015, Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said 417 of the country's 436 mosques had been destroyed, and Muslim women were so scared of going out in public they were giving birth in their homes instead of going to the hospital. On 14 December 2015, S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rebel leaders declared an independent &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20Logone\"&gt;Republic of Logone&lt;/a&gt;.\nTouad\u00e9ra government (2016\u2013).\n&lt;a href=\"2015%E2%80%9316%20Central%20African%20general%20election\"&gt;Presidential elections&lt;/a&gt; were held in December 2015. As no candidate received more than 50% of the vote, a second round of elections was held on 14 February 2016 with run-offs on 31 March 2016. In the second round of voting, former Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Faustin-Archange%20Touad%C3%A9ra\"&gt;Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra&lt;/a&gt; was declared the winner with 63% of the vote, defeating &lt;a href=\"Union%20for%20Central%20African%20Renewal\"&gt;Union for Central African Renewal&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href=\"Anicet-Georges%20Dologu%C3%A9l%C3%A9\"&gt;Anicet-Georges Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, another former Prime Minister. While the elections suffered from many potential voters being absent as they had taken refuge in other countries, the fears of widespread violence were ultimately unfounded and the &lt;a href=\"African%20Union\"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; regarded the elections as successful.\nTouad\u00e9ra was sworn in on 30 March 2016. No representatives of the Seleka rebel group or the \"anti-balaka\" militias were included in the subsequently formed government.\nAfter the end of Touad\u00e9ra's first term, &lt;a href=\"2020%E2%80%9321%20Central%20African%20general%20election\"&gt;presidential elections&lt;/a&gt; were held on 27 December 2020 with a possible second round planned for 14 February 2021. Former president &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Boziz%C3%A9\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; announced his candidacy on 25 July 2020 but was rejected by the Constitutional Court of the country, which held that Boziz\u00e9 did not satisfy the \u201cgood morality\u201d requirement for candidates because of an international warrant and &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; sanctions against him for alleged assassinations, torture and other crimes.\nAs large parts of the country were at the time controlled by armed groups, the election could not be conducted in many areas of the country. Some 800 of the country's polling stations, 14% of the total, were closed due to violence. Three &lt;a href=\"Burundi\"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt;an peacekeepers were killed and an additional two were wounded during the run-up to the election. President Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra was reelected in the first round of the election in December 2020.\nGeography.\nThe Central African Republic is a landlocked nation within the interior of the African continent. It is bordered by Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Republic of the Congo. The country lies between latitudes &lt;a href=\"2nd%20parallel%20north\"&gt;2\u00b0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"11th%20parallel%20north\"&gt;11\u00b0N&lt;/a&gt;, and longitudes &lt;a href=\"14th%20meridian%20east\"&gt;14\u00b0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"28th%20meridian%20east\"&gt;28\u00b0E&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch of the country consists of flat or rolling plateau &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt; approximately above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the Fertit Hills in the northeast of the Central African Republic, there are scattered hills in the southwest regions. In the northwest is the Yade Massif, a &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt; plateau with an altitude of . The Central African Republic contains six terrestrial ecoregions: &lt;a href=\"Northeastern%20Congolian%20lowland%20forests\"&gt;Northeastern Congolian lowland forests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northwestern%20Congolian%20lowland%20forests\"&gt;Northwestern Congolian lowland forests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Western%20Congolian%20swamp%20forests\"&gt;Western Congolian swamp forests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20Sudanian%20savanna\"&gt;East Sudanian savanna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Congolian%20forest-savanna%20mosaic\"&gt;Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sahelian%20Acacia%20savanna\"&gt;Sahelian Acacia savanna&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt , the Central African Republic is the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20and%20dependencies%20by%20area\"&gt;world's 44th-largest country&lt;/a&gt;. It is comparable in size to &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Ukraine\"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; is in area, according to &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20and%20dependencies%20by%20area\"&gt;List of countries and dependencies by area&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch of the southern border is formed by &lt;a href=\"Tributary\"&gt;tributaries&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Congo%20River\"&gt;Congo River&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Mbomou%20River\"&gt;Mbomou River&lt;/a&gt; in the east merges with the &lt;a href=\"Uele%20River\"&gt;Uele River&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Ubangi%20River\"&gt;Ubangi River&lt;/a&gt;, which also comprises portions of the southern border. The &lt;a href=\"Sangha%20River\"&gt;Sangha River&lt;/a&gt; flows through some of the western regions of the country, while the eastern border lies along the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Nile%20River\"&gt;Nile River&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"drainage%20basin\"&gt;watershed&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has been estimated that up to 8% of the country is covered by forest, with the densest parts generally located in the southern regions. The forests are highly diverse and include commercially important species of &lt;a href=\"Ayous\"&gt;Ayous&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sapele\"&gt;Sapelli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sipo%20%28timber%29\"&gt;Sipo&lt;/a&gt;. The deforestation rate is about 0.4% per annum, and &lt;a href=\"Illegal%20logging\"&gt;lumber poaching&lt;/a&gt; is commonplace. The Central African Republic had a 2018 &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Landscape%20Integrity%20Index\"&gt;Forest Landscape Integrity Index&lt;/a&gt; mean score of 9.28/10, ranking it 7th globally out of 172 countries.\nIn 2008, Central African Republic was the world's least &lt;a href=\"light%20pollution\"&gt;light pollution&lt;/a&gt; affected country.\nThe Central African Republic is the focal point of the &lt;a href=\"Bangui%20Magnetic%20Anomaly\"&gt;Bangui Magnetic Anomaly&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest magnetic anomalies on Earth.\nLand.\nThe Central African Republic is roughly the size of &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Chad\"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Sudan\"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Sudan\"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt; to the north and east, the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; (Kinshasa) and the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) to the south, and &lt;a href=\"Cameroon\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; to the west. The capital, Bangui, is situated on the southern boundary, formed by the &lt;a href=\"Ubangi%20River\"&gt;Ubangi River&lt;/a&gt;, a tributary of the &lt;a href=\"Congo%20River\"&gt;Congo River&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelief, drainage and soils.\nThe Central African Republic occupies an immense rolling &lt;a href=\"plateau\"&gt;plateau&lt;/a&gt; that forms, along a crest that trends southwest to northeast, the major drainage divide between the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Chad\"&gt;Lake Chad&lt;/a&gt; and Congo River basins. The country is well supplied with waterways. Tributaries of the &lt;a href=\"Chari%20River\"&gt;Chari River&lt;/a&gt; occupy the northern third of the country\u2019s territory. The remaining two-thirds of the terrain drains southward into the &lt;a href=\"Ubangi%20River\"&gt;Ubangi River&lt;/a&gt;, which forms the Central African Republic\u2019s southern border with Congo (Kinshasa).\nThe vast central plains rise gradually in the northeast to the Bongos (Bongo) Massif, extending to an elevation of 4,360 feet (1,330 metres) at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Toussoro\"&gt;Mount Toussoro&lt;/a&gt;, and to the &lt;a href=\"Tondou%20Massif\"&gt;Tondou Massif&lt;/a&gt; in the east. In the west they rise toward the high granite range of the &lt;a href=\"Karre%20Mountains\"&gt;Karre Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, reaching nearly 4,625 feet (1,410 metres) at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Ngaoui\"&gt;Mount Ngaoui&lt;/a&gt;, the country\u2019s highest point, before declining eastward into sandstone plateaus. In the north the most significant mountains are those of the &lt;a href=\"Dar%20Challa\"&gt;Dar Challa&lt;/a&gt; range, which rise to 4,350 feet (1,326 metres) at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Ngaya\"&gt;Mount Ngaya&lt;/a&gt; near the border with Sudan. In the southeast is a plain cut by a number of &lt;a href=\"River\"&gt;rivers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWildlife.\nIn the southwest, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park is located in a rain forest area. The country is noted for its population of &lt;a href=\"forest%20elephant\"&gt;forest elephant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"western%20lowland%20gorilla\"&gt;western lowland gorilla&lt;/a&gt;s. In the north, the &lt;a href=\"Manovo-Gounda%20St%20Floris%20National%20Park\"&gt;Manovo-Gounda St Floris National Park&lt;/a&gt; is well-populated with wildlife, including &lt;a href=\"African%20leopard\"&gt;leopards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20lion\"&gt;lions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sudan%20cheetah\"&gt;cheetahs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhinoceros\"&gt;rhinos&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bamingui-Bangoran%20National%20Park\"&gt;Bamingui-Bangoran National Park&lt;/a&gt; is located in the northeast of the Central African Republic. The parks have been seriously affected by the activities of poachers, particularly those from &lt;a href=\"Sudan\"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, over the past two decades.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the Central African Republic is generally &lt;a href=\"Tropics\"&gt;tropical&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"wet%20season\"&gt;wet season&lt;/a&gt; that lasts from June to September in the northern regions of the country, and from May to October in the south. During the wet season, rainstorms are an almost daily occurrence, and early morning &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt; is commonplace. Maximum annual precipitation is approximately in the upper Ubangi region.\nThe northern areas are hot and humid from February to May, but can be subject to the hot, dry, and dusty &lt;a href=\"trade%20wind\"&gt;trade wind&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Harmattan\"&gt;Harmattan&lt;/a&gt;. The southern regions have a more equatorial climate, but they are subject to &lt;a href=\"desertification\"&gt;desertification&lt;/a&gt;, while the extreme northeast regions of the country are a &lt;a href=\"steppe\"&gt;steppe&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrefectures and sub-prefectures.\nThe Central African Republic is divided into 16 administrative &lt;a href=\"prefecture\"&gt;prefecture&lt;/a&gt;s (\"pr\u00e9fectures\"), two of which are economic prefectures (\"pr\u00e9fectures economiques\"), and one an autonomous &lt;a href=\"Commune%20%28subnational%20entity%29\"&gt;commune&lt;/a&gt;; the prefectures are further divided into 71 sub-prefectures (\"sous-pr\u00e9fectures\").\nThe &lt;a href=\"prefectures%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic\"&gt;prefectures&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Bamingui-Bangoran\"&gt;Bamingui-Bangoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Basse-Kotto\"&gt;Basse-Kotto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haute-Kotto\"&gt;Haute-Kotto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haut-Mbomou\"&gt;Haut-Mbomou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K%C3%A9mo\"&gt;K\u00e9mo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lobaye\"&gt;Lobaye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mamb%C3%A9r%C3%A9-Kad%C3%A9%C3%AF\"&gt;Mamb\u00e9r\u00e9-Kad\u00e9\u00ef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mbomou\"&gt;Mbomou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nana-Mamb%C3%A9r%C3%A9\"&gt;Nana-Mamb\u00e9r\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ombella-M%27Poko\"&gt;Ombella-M'Poko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ouaka\"&gt;Ouaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ouham\"&gt;Ouham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ouham-Pend%C3%A9\"&gt;Ouham-Pend\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vakaga\"&gt;Vakaga&lt;/a&gt;. The economic prefectures are &lt;a href=\"Nana-Gr%C3%A9bizi\"&gt;Nana-Gr\u00e9bizi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sangha-Mba%C3%A9r%C3%A9\"&gt;Sangha-Mba\u00e9r\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, while the commune is the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Bangui\"&gt;Bangui&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitics and government.\nPolitics in the Central African Republic formally take place in a framework of a &lt;a href=\"semi-presidential%20system\"&gt;semi-presidential&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt;. In this system, the &lt;a href=\"Heads%20of%20state%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic%20%28and%20Central%20African%20Empire%29\"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"Heads%20of%20government%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic%20%28and%20Central%20African%20Empire%29\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20government\"&gt;head of government&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Executive%20power\"&gt;Executive power&lt;/a&gt; is exercised by the government. &lt;a href=\"Legislative%20power\"&gt;Legislative power&lt;/a&gt; is vested in both the government and parliament.\nChanges in government have occurred in recent years by three methods: violence, negotiations, and elections. A new constitution was approved by voters in a referendum held on 5 December 2004. The government was rated 'Partly Free' from 1991 to 2001 and from 2004 to 2013.\nExecutive branch.\nThe president is elected by popular vote for a six-year term, and the prime minister is appointed by the president. The president also appoints and presides over the &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic%20Council%20of%20Ministers\"&gt;Council of Ministers&lt;/a&gt;, which initiates laws and oversees government operations. However, as of 2018 the official government is not in control of large parts of the country, which are governed by rebel groups.\nActing president since April 2016 is &lt;a href=\"Faustin%20Archange%20Touadera\"&gt;Faustin Archange Touadera&lt;/a&gt; who followed the interim government under &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20Samba-Panza\"&gt;Catherine Samba-Panza&lt;/a&gt;, interim prime minister &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Nzapayek%C3%A9\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Nzapayek\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegislative branch.\nThe &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; (\"Assembl\u00e9e Nationale\") has 140 members, elected for a five-year term using the two-round (or &lt;a href=\"Two-round%20system\"&gt;Run-off&lt;/a&gt;) system.\nJudicial branch.\nAs in many other former French colonies, the Central African Republic's legal system is based on &lt;a href=\"French%20law\"&gt;French law&lt;/a&gt;. The Supreme Court, or \"Cour Supreme\", is made up of judges appointed by the president. There is also a Constitutional Court, and its judges are also appointed by the president.\nForeign relations.\nThe Central African Republic relies heavily on Russian mercenaries for the protection of its diamond mines.\nForeign aid and UN Involvement.\nThe Central African Republic is heavily dependent upon foreign &lt;a href=\"aid\"&gt;aid&lt;/a&gt; and numerous &lt;a href=\"Non-governmental%20organization\"&gt;NGOs&lt;/a&gt; provide services that the government does not provide. In 2019, over US$100\u00a0million in foreign aid was spent in the country, mostly on humanitarian assistance.\nIn 2006, due to ongoing violence, over 50,000 people in the country's northwest were at risk of starvation, but this was averted due to assistance from the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. On 8 January 2008, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon declared that the Central African Republic was eligible to receive assistance from the Peacebuilding Fund. Three priority areas were identified: first, the reform of the security sector; second, the promotion of good governance and the rule of law; and third, the revitalization of communities affected by conflicts. On 12 June 2008, the Central African Republic requested assistance from the &lt;a href=\"UN%20Peacebuilding%20Commission\"&gt;UN Peacebuilding Commission&lt;/a&gt;, which was set up in 2005 to help countries emerging from conflict avoid devolving back into war or chaos.\nIn response to concerns of a potential genocide, a peacekeeping force \u2013 the International Support Mission to the Central African Republic (MISCA) \u2013 was authorized in December 2013. This African Union force of 6,000 personnel was accompanied by the French Operation Sangaris.\nIn 2017, Central African Republic signed the UN &lt;a href=\"treaty%20on%20the%20Prohibition%20of%20Nuclear%20Weapons\"&gt;treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman rights.\nThe 2009 Human Rights Report by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20State\"&gt;United States Department of State&lt;/a&gt; noted that human rights in the Central African Republic were poor and expressed concerns over numerous government abuses. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20State%20Department\"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt; alleged that major human rights abuses such as &lt;a href=\"Extrajudicial%20punishment\"&gt;extrajudicial executions&lt;/a&gt; by security forces, &lt;a href=\"torture\"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt;, beatings and &lt;a href=\"rape\"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt; of suspects and prisoners occurred with impunity. It also alleged harsh and life-threatening conditions in &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;s and detention centers, &lt;a href=\"arbitrary%20arrest%20and%20detention\"&gt;arbitrary arrest&lt;/a&gt;, prolonged &lt;a href=\"Remand%20%28detention%29\"&gt;pretrial detention&lt;/a&gt; and denial of a &lt;a href=\"Right%20to%20a%20fair%20trial\"&gt;fair trial&lt;/a&gt;, restrictions on freedom of movement, official &lt;a href=\"corruption\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;, and restrictions on &lt;a href=\"Labor%20rights\"&gt;workers' rights&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe State Department report also cites widespread &lt;a href=\"Riot\"&gt;mob violence&lt;/a&gt;, the prevalence of &lt;a href=\"female%20genital%20mutilation\"&gt;female genital mutilation&lt;/a&gt;, discrimination against women and &lt;a href=\"Pygmy%20peoples\"&gt;Pygmies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"human%20trafficking\"&gt;human trafficking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unfree%20labour\"&gt;forced labor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"child%20labor\"&gt;child labor&lt;/a&gt;. Freedom of movement is limited in the northern part of the country \"because of actions by state security forces, armed bandits, and other nonstate armed entities\", and due to fighting between government and anti-government forces, many persons have been &lt;a href=\"Internally%20displaced%20person\"&gt;internally displaced&lt;/a&gt;.\nViolence against children and women in relation to accusations of &lt;a href=\"witchcraft\"&gt;witchcraft&lt;/a&gt; has also been cited as a serious problem in the country. Witchcraft is a criminal offense under the penal code.\n&lt;a href=\"Freedom%20of%20speech\"&gt;Freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt; is addressed in the country's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Central_African_Republic_2013%3Flang%3Den%2367\"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;, but there have been incidents of government intimidation of the media. A report by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Research%20%26amp%3B%20Exchanges%20Board\"&gt;International Research &amp; Exchanges Board&lt;/a&gt;'s media sustainability index noted that \"the country minimally met objectives, with segments of the legal system and government opposed to a free media system\".\nApproximately 68% of girls are married before they turn 18, and the United Nations' &lt;a href=\"Human%20Development%20Index\"&gt;Human Development Index&lt;/a&gt; ranked the country 188 out of 188 countries surveyed. The &lt;a href=\"Bureau%20of%20International%20Labor%20Affairs\"&gt;Bureau of International Labor Affairs&lt;/a&gt; has also mentioned it in its last edition of the \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Goods%20Produced%20by%20Child%20Labor%20or%20Forced%20Labor\"&gt;List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDemographics.\nThe population of the Central African Republic has almost quadrupled since independence. In 1960, the population was 1,232,000; as of a UN estimate, it is approximately .\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; estimates that approximately 4% of the population aged between 15 and 49 is &lt;a href=\"HIV\"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; positive. Only 3% of the country has &lt;a href=\"antiretroviral\"&gt;antiretroviral&lt;/a&gt; therapy available, compared to a 17% coverage in the neighbouring countries of &lt;a href=\"Chad\"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe nation is divided into over 80 ethnic groups, each having its own language. The largest ethnic groups are the &lt;a href=\"Baggara\"&gt;Baggara Arabs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baka%20people%20%28Cameroon%20and%20Gabon%29\"&gt;Baka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banda%20people\"&gt;Banda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aka%20people\"&gt;Bayaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fula%20people\"&gt;Fula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gbaya%20people\"&gt;Gbaya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kara%20people\"&gt;Kara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kresh%20people\"&gt;Kresh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mbaka%20people\"&gt;Mbaka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mandja%20people\"&gt;Mandja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ngbandi%20people\"&gt;Ngbandi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sara%20people\"&gt;Sara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vidiri%20people\"&gt;Vidiri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wodaabe\"&gt;Wodaabe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yakoma%20people\"&gt;Yakoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yulu%20people\"&gt;Yulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zande%20people\"&gt;Zande&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Demographics%20of%20the%20Central%20African%20Republic%23Ethnic%20groups\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20groups%20in%20Europe\"&gt;Europeans&lt;/a&gt; of mostly &lt;a href=\"French%20people\"&gt;French descent&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nAccording to the 2003 national census, 80.3% of the population was &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; (51.4% &lt;a href=\"Protestantism\"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; and 28.9% &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholicism\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt;), 10% was &lt;a href=\"Islam\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; and 4.5 percent other religious groups, with 5.5 percent having no religious beliefs. More recent work from the Pew Research Center estimated that, as of 2010, Christians constituted 89.8% of the population (60.7% Protestant and 28.5% Catholic) while Muslims made up 8.9%. The Catholic Church claims over 1.5\u00a0million adherents, approximately one-third of the population. Indigenous belief (&lt;a href=\"animism\"&gt;animism&lt;/a&gt;) is also practiced, and many indigenous beliefs are &lt;a href=\"Religious%20syncretism\"&gt;incorporated into&lt;/a&gt; Christian and Islamic practice. A UN director described religious tensions between Muslims and Christians as being high.\nThere are many missionary groups operating in the country, including &lt;a href=\"Lutheranism\"&gt;Lutherans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baptists\"&gt;Baptists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Catholicism\"&gt;Catholics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fellowship%20of%20Grace%20Brethren%20Churches\"&gt;Grace Brethren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses\"&gt;Jehovah's Witnesses&lt;/a&gt;. While these missionaries are predominantly from the United States, France, Italy, and Spain, many are also from &lt;a href=\"Nigeria\"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, and other African countries. Large numbers of missionaries left the country when fighting broke out between rebel and government forces in 2002\u20133, but many of them have now returned to continue their work.\nAccording to Overseas Development Institute research, during the crisis ongoing since 2012, religious leaders have mediated between communities and armed groups; they also provided refuge for people seeking shelter.\nLanguages.\nThe Central African Republic's two official languages are &lt;a href=\"French%20language\"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sango%20language\"&gt;Sango&lt;/a&gt; (also spelled Sangho), a &lt;a href=\"Creole%20language\"&gt;creole&lt;/a&gt; developed as an inter-ethnic &lt;a href=\"lingua%20franca\"&gt;lingua franca&lt;/a&gt; based on the local &lt;a href=\"Ngbandi%20language\"&gt;Ngbandi language&lt;/a&gt;. The Central African Republic is one of the few African countries to have an &lt;a href=\"Languages%20of%20Africa\"&gt;African language&lt;/a&gt; as their official language.\nEconomy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"per%20capita%20income\"&gt;per capita income&lt;/a&gt; of the Republic is often listed as being approximately $400 a year, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20countries%20by%20GNI%20%28PPP%29%20per%20capita\"&gt;one of the lowest in the world&lt;/a&gt;, but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of exports and largely ignores the unregistered sale of foods, locally produced &lt;a href=\"alcoholic%20beverage\"&gt;alcoholic beverage&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ivory\"&gt;ivory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bushmeat\"&gt;bushmeat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"traditional%20medicine\"&gt;traditional medicine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe currency of the Central African Republic is the &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20CFA%20franc\"&gt;CFA franc&lt;/a&gt;, which is accepted across the former countries of &lt;a href=\"French%20West%20Africa\"&gt;French West Africa&lt;/a&gt; and trades at a fixed rate to the euro. Diamonds constitute the country's most important export, accounting for 40\u201355% of export revenues, but it is estimated that between 30% and 50% of those produced each year leave the country clandestinely.\nAgriculture is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as &lt;a href=\"cassava\"&gt;cassava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"peanut\"&gt;peanut&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"maize\"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sorghum\"&gt;sorghum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"millet\"&gt;millet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sesame\"&gt;sesame&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Plantain%20%28cooking%29\"&gt;plantain&lt;/a&gt;. The annual real GDP &lt;a href=\"Economic%20growth\"&gt;growth rate&lt;/a&gt; is just above 3%. The importance of food crops over exported &lt;a href=\"cash%20crops\"&gt;cash crops&lt;/a&gt; is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between 200,000 and 300,000 &lt;a href=\"tonnes\"&gt;tonnes&lt;/a&gt; a year, while the production of &lt;a href=\"cotton\"&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt;, the principal exported cash crop, ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 tonnes a year. Food crops are not exported in large quantities, but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country, because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee. Much of the country is self-sufficient in food crops; however, &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; development is hindered by the presence of the &lt;a href=\"tsetse%20fly\"&gt;tsetse fly&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Republic's primary import partner is &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (17.1%). Other imports come from the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; (12.3%), India (11.5%), and &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; (8.2%). Its largest export partner is &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (31.2%), followed by &lt;a href=\"Burundi\"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt; (16.2%), &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; (12.5%), &lt;a href=\"Cameroon\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; (9.6%), and &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; (7.8%).\nThe Central African Republic is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Organization%20for%20the%20Harmonization%20of%20Business%20Law%20in%20Africa\"&gt;Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa&lt;/a&gt; (OHADA). In the 2009 &lt;a href=\"World%20Bank%20Group\"&gt;World Bank Group&lt;/a&gt;'s report \"Doing Business\", it was ranked 183rd of 183 as regards 'ease of doing business', a &lt;a href=\"Composite%20%28finance%29\"&gt;composite index&lt;/a&gt; which takes into account regulations that enhance business activity and those that restrict it.\nIn 2020 Gdp ppp is 4,73milliards\\billions dollars. Gdp pps\\per capita ~1014$\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nBangui is the transport hub of the Central African Republic. As of 1999, eight roads connected the city to other main towns in the country, &lt;a href=\"Cameroon\"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;, Chad and &lt;a href=\"South%20Sudan\"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt;; of these, only the toll roads are paved. During the rainy season from July to October, some roads are impassable.\nRiver &lt;a href=\"ferry\"&gt;ferries&lt;/a&gt; sail from the &lt;a href=\"river%20port\"&gt;river port&lt;/a&gt; at Bangui to &lt;a href=\"Brazzaville\"&gt;Brazzaville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zongo%2C%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo\"&gt;Zongo&lt;/a&gt;. The river can be navigated most of the year between Bangui and Brazzaville. From Brazzaville, goods are transported by rail to &lt;a href=\"Pointe-Noire\"&gt;Pointe-Noire&lt;/a&gt;, Congo's Atlantic port. The river port handles the overwhelming majority of the country's international trade and has a cargo handling capacity of 350,000 tons; it has length of &lt;a href=\"wharfs\"&gt;wharfs&lt;/a&gt; and of warehousing space.\n&lt;a href=\"Bangui%20M%27Poko%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Bangui M'Poko International Airport&lt;/a&gt; is Central African Republic's only international airport. As of June 2014 it had regularly scheduled direct flights to &lt;a href=\"Maya-Maya%20Airport\"&gt;Brazzaville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mohammed%20V%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Casablanca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cadjehoun%20Airport\"&gt;Cotonou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Douala%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Douala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"N%27djili%20Airport\"&gt;Kinshasa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lom%C3%A9-Tokoin%20Airport\"&gt;Lom\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quatro%20de%20Fevereiro%20Airport\"&gt;Luanda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malabo%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Malabo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"N%27Djamena%20International%20Airport\"&gt;N'Djamena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paris-Charles%20de%20Gaulle\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pointe%20Noire%20Airport\"&gt;Pointe-Noire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yaound%C3%A9%20Nsimalen%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Yaound\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince at least 2002 there have been plans to connect Bangui by &lt;a href=\"Rail%20transport\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Transcameroon%20Railway\"&gt;Transcameroon Railway&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnergy.\nThe Central African Republic primarily uses &lt;a href=\"hydroelectricity\"&gt;hydroelectricity&lt;/a&gt; as there are few other resources for energy and power.\nCommunications.\nPresently, the Central African Republic has active television services, radio stations, &lt;a href=\"internet%20service%20providers\"&gt;internet service providers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20network%20operator\"&gt;mobile phone carriers&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Socatel\"&gt;Socatel&lt;/a&gt; is the leading provider for both internet and mobile phone access throughout the country. The primary governmental regulating bodies of telecommunications are the Minist\u00e8re des Postes and T\u00e9l\u00e9communications et des Nouvelles Technologies. In addition, the Central African Republic receives international support on telecommunication related operations from &lt;a href=\"ITU-D\"&gt;ITU Telecommunication Development Sector (ITU-D)&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"International%20Telecommunication%20Union\"&gt;International Telecommunication Union&lt;/a&gt; to improve infrastructure.\nEducation.\nPublic education in the Central African Republic is free and is compulsory from ages 6 to 14. However, approximately half of the adult population of the country is &lt;a href=\"Literacy\"&gt;illiterate&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigher education.\nThe two institutions of higher education in the Central African Republic are the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Bangui\"&gt;University of Bangui&lt;/a&gt;, a public university located in Bangui, which includes a &lt;a href=\"medical%20school\"&gt;medical school&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Euclid%20University\"&gt;Euclid University&lt;/a&gt;, an international university.\nHealthcare.\nThe largest hospitals in the country are located in the Bangui district. As a member of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Health%20Organization\"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, the Central African Republic receives vaccination assistance, such as a 2014 intervention for the prevention of a measles epidemic. In 2007, female &lt;a href=\"life%20expectancy%20at%20birth\"&gt;life expectancy at birth&lt;/a&gt; was 48.2 years and male life expectancy at birth was 45.1 years.\n&lt;a href=\"Women%27s%20health\"&gt;Women's health&lt;/a&gt; is poor in the Central African Republic. , the country had the 4th highest &lt;a href=\"maternal%20mortality\"&gt;maternal mortality&lt;/a&gt; rate in the world.\nThe &lt;a href=\"total%20fertility%20rate\"&gt;total fertility rate&lt;/a&gt; in 2014 was estimated at 4.46 children born/woman. Approximately 25% of women had undergone &lt;a href=\"female%20genital%20mutilation\"&gt;female genital mutilation&lt;/a&gt;. Many births in the country are guided by traditional birth attendants, who often have little or no formal training.\n&lt;a href=\"Malaria\"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; is endemic in the Central African Republic, and one of the leading causes of death.\nAccording to 2009 estimates, the HIV/AIDS &lt;a href=\"prevalence\"&gt;prevalence&lt;/a&gt; rate is about 4.7% of the adult population (ages 15\u201349). This is in general agreement with the 2016 &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; estimate of approximately 4%. Government expenditure on health was US$20 (PPP) per person in 2006 and 10.9% of total government expenditure in 2006. There was only around 1 physician for every 20,000 persons in 2009.\nCulture.\nSports.\nBasketball is the country's most popular sport and a good way to connect with its people. Its &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic%20national%20basketball%20team\"&gt;national team&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"AfroBasket\"&gt;African Championship&lt;/a&gt; twice and was the first Sub-Saharan African team to qualify for the &lt;a href=\"Basketball%20World%20Cup\"&gt;Basketball World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"1974%20FIBA%20World%20Championship\"&gt;1974&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe country also has a &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;national football team&lt;/a&gt;, which is governed by the &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Football%20Federation\"&gt;Central African Football Federation&lt;/a&gt;, and stages matches at the &lt;a href=\"Barth%C3%A9lemy%20Boganda%20Stadium\"&gt;Barth\u00e9lemy Boganda Stadium&lt;/a&gt;."
