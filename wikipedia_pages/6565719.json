    "text": "The 1909 &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20Football%20League%20premiership\"&gt;New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership&lt;/a&gt; was the second season of &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;'s top-level &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; football competition, Australia's first. Eight teams contested during the season for the premiership and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Agricultural%20Society%20of%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Royal Agricultural Society&lt;/a&gt; Challenge Shield; seven teams from Sydney and one team from &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Newcastle, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the beginning of the season, the nearly broke NSWRFL had met and kicked out its founders &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Hoyle\"&gt;Henry Hoyle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Trumper\"&gt;Victor Trumper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"J%20J%20Giltinan\"&gt;J J Giltinan&lt;/a&gt;. Part-way through the season, &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Larkin\"&gt;Edward Larkin&lt;/a&gt; was appointed full-time secretary of the NSWRFL.\nAlso in 1909 north of the border, the &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20Rugby%20Football%20League\"&gt;Queensland Rugby Football League&lt;/a&gt; got its club competition started for the rebel football code of rugby league.\nTeams.\nThe teams that made up the 1909 premiership season were the same as the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League%20season%201908\"&gt;1908 season&lt;/a&gt; with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20%28rugby%20league%20team%29\"&gt;Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; who were dissolved, being unable to field a competitive team. Their last premiership match turned out to be a 45\u20130 loss at the hands of &lt;a href=\"North%20Sydney%20Bears\"&gt;North Sydney&lt;/a&gt; on 25 July 1908, a game where the team had to \"borrow\" two of North Sydney's officials in order to make up a 13-man side. Seven of Cumberland's players ended up going to &lt;a href=\"Western%20Suburbs%20Magpies\"&gt;Western Suburbs&lt;/a&gt; the following year, but only three of these players were able to play another premiership match.\nSouths lost only one game in the regular season, to Newcastle in Newcastle, 3 days after the Novocastrians had beaten the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20M%C4%81ori%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New Zealand M\u0101ori team&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlebe included &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Moko\"&gt;Peter Moko&lt;/a&gt;, the first player of Polynesian background to play in the premiership.\nNewcastle exited the League at the end of the season.\nTouring sides.\nDuring the season the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New Zealand national side&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1909%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20league%20tour%20of%20Australia\"&gt;toured in June\u2013July&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the &lt;a href=\"1909%20New%20Zealand%20M%C4%81ori%20rugby%20league%20tour%20of%20Australia\"&gt;second New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby league tour of Australia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinals.\nIn 1909 semi-finals were played amongst the four highest placed teams. Top two finishers &lt;a href=\"South%20Sydney%20Rabbitohs\"&gt;South Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balmain%20Tigers\"&gt;Balmain&lt;/a&gt; were able to win their respective semi-finals. However, after the New South Wales Rugby League had planned a match between the Australian &lt;a href=\"Australian%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Australian%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; teams that would upstage the premiership final, both South Sydney and Balmain unofficially agreed to not play out a final. But unknown to Balmain, South Sydney turned up ready to play. The final was deemed to be a forfeit as a result, with South Sydney claiming their second premiership in as many years. Requests from Balmain for the match to be played at a later date were refused by the League. Conflict over whether there was an agreement between the two clubs not to play a final caused a deep-seated resentment towards Souths by Balmain which lasted many years.\nIt was the most dramatic action ever taken by a rugby league club \u2013 the 1909 Balmain team forfeited the premiership Final. \nArguments have raged as to what led to Balmain's actions, and the day's events have caused the 'Tigers' and the South Sydney Rabbitohs to generally harbour nothing but ill-will towards each other ever-since.\nThe seeds of the dramatic events of 1909 lay in the years before rugby league was formed, back when Balmain and Souths were rugby union clubs.\nIn 1900 the Metropolitan Rugby Union (MRU) replaced the private clubs of the 1800s with district clubs.\nThis was done to more evenly distribute the talent between clubs, and to build upon the growing support for suburban based clubs.\nWhile Balmain had use of 'the best ground in the colony' in Birchgrove Park [Oval], the MRU inexplicably ignored its 'home-and-away' scheduling for club matches, and refused to allocate South Sydney matches anywhere but at the SCG or Sports Ground.\nBetween 1900 and 1906, Souths and Balmain had met 14 times, yet the 'red-and-greens' had only twice been required to play at Birchgrove.\nWhile most clubs trained indoors at night or on fields under moonlight, Souths and Easts had exclusive use of the lights of the Sports Ground. Understandably, other clubs, particularly Balmain and Norths felt that Souths and Easts were receiving favourable treatment.\nThe newspapers and opposing fans had come to call the Balmain club \"the Balmainiacs\". Unafraid to vent their feelings, especially at home games, Balmain were not the most popular club amongst Sydney 'rugbyites'.\nWhen the opportunity came to join the newly formed rugby league in the early months of 1908, most rugby union clubs lost approximately half of their players and members. \nIn Balmain's case, the League got just about everybody.\nWhen the Balmain Union club held its first meeting of 1908, all the district's League supporters attended and voted against the election of every official for the coming season.\nWhile they really had no cause to even be at the Union club's meeting, the presence of the League supporters prevented the Union club from being formed for the coming season. \nThe MRU organised the follow-up meeting for the same night as the next Balmain League meeting, just so it could carry on its business.\nBy the start of the 1909 season, the NSWRL was in a dire financial crisis \u2013 its founding fathers, James Giltinan, Victor Trumper and 'Harry' Hoyle, all lost their positions.\nUnder the stewardship of North Sydney's Alexander Knox, the NSWRL convinced the clubs to forgo their gate receipts from matches, and hand it all over to the League.\nIt quickly became apparent to Knox that the only club attracting reasonable crowds was Balmain at Birchgrove Park. \nConsequently, Balmain were given a home game in almost every round.\nAs a result, they enjoyed great on-field success and climbed the premiership ladder. \nBalmain reached the Final against South Sydney.\nHowever, as Souths had won the minor premiership by two points, the NSWRL play-offs system meant that Balmain had to beat them in the Final, and then beat them again in a second Final to claim the title. It seemed unlikely.\nBalmain lobbied the NSWRL to schedule the Final at Wentworth Park, which was half-way between the two districts. \nThe League refused, and put the match on at the Agricultural Ground \u2013 Souths home field.\nBalmain's complaints were quickly overtaken by outside events when more than half of the 1908 Wallabies team suddenly defected to rugby league for a series of matches against the Kangaroos.\nThe Final was postponed indefinitely.\nKnox publicly criticised the NSWRL officials who were involved in 'bringing-down' the NSWRU via paying huge sums to the Wallabies. \nOther officials did not see a problem with the League's actions, and Knox soon lost his position on the NSWRL.\nFunded by entrepreneur James Joynton-Smith, the three 'Wallabies v Kangaroos' matches did not earn enough gate-money to fully cover his costs or those of the NSWRL. \nSo a fourth game was arranged. To increase interest and gate-takings, the NSWRL scheduled the Final on the under-card.\nBalmain were seemingly aggrieved at the demotion of importance of the Final, and asked the NSWRL to ensure it was played on a separate day. \nThey also argued that their players' labour should not go towards paying money owed to Joynton-Smith and the NSWRL. \nThe League refused and Balmain announced that they would not play.\nOn the day of the Final the Balmain players arrived outside the ground in the early afternoon, well before the scheduled kick-off time of 2 o\u2019clock. \nThey then picketed the entrance, endeavouring to convince patrons not to enter.\nDespite very heavy rain and the protests of the Balmain footballers, enough of a crowd turned up to clear the debts of Joynton-Smith and the NSWRL. \nBalmain stuck to their word and did not appear on the field. \nSouths kicked off, picked up the ball and scored a try. \nThe referee awarded them the match, and with it the 1909 premiership.\nIn the days that followed a public meeting was held at Balmain to decide what to do about challenging Souths being credited as premiers. \nIt then became apparent what Balmain had been trying to achieve. \nThe first speaker at the meeting was North Sydney's Alexander Knox. \nHe had convinced Balmain to forfeit the Final in the hope that the NSWRL would not earn enough money to pay off its debts or be able to reimburse Joynton-Smith.\nWith the NSWRL bankrupted, Balmain and Norths officials would lead the formation of a new rugby league body \u2013 one in which they, and not South Sydney and Easts, would be the dominant office-holders. \nWith little hope of winning the premiership, Balmain felt they had more to gain by causing the NSWRL to collapse.\nFurther meetings were held, attempting to instigate legal proceedings and investigate forming a new League, but they eventually stalled.\nIn the opening round of the 1910 competition, the NSWRL scheduled a 're-match' between Souths and Balmain at Birchgrove Park to appease the local supporters.\n'The Balmainiacs' responded by establishing a record crowd for a NSWRL club match of over 5,000. The home team though were beaten 13\u20135 in a very tough and physical encounter.\nThe Referee thought it necessary to praise the Birchgrove crowd for their behaviour, offering: \n\"Naturally they like to see their favourites win, and what district does not? In the present instance, however, their team had to play second fiddle, but as sports they took the defeat in good spirit, and liberally applauded the visitors\".\nAt the first NSWRL meeting of 1910, Norths' Alexander Knox was banned from rugby league for life.\nMembers of the South Sydney side who showed up on Grand Final day and won by forfeit were:\n&lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Butler%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Arthur Butler&lt;/a&gt; \u2022 &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Conlin\"&gt;Arthur Conlin&lt;/a&gt; (c) \u2022 &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Butler%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Harry Butler&lt;/a&gt; \u2022 &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Hallett\"&gt;Howard Hallett&lt;/a&gt; \u2022 &lt;a href=\"Todd%20Anderson\"&gt;T.Anderson&lt;/a&gt; \u2022 &lt;a href=\"J.Davis\"&gt;J.Davis&lt;/a&gt; \u2022 &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Storie\"&gt;Frank Storie&lt;/a&gt; \u2022 &lt;a href=\"Ed%20Fry\"&gt;Ed Fry&lt;/a&gt; \u2022 &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Green%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Dick Green&lt;/a&gt; \u2022 &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Coxon\"&gt;Jack Coxon&lt;/a&gt; \u2022 &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Cann\"&gt;Billy Cann&lt;/a&gt; \u2022 &lt;a href=\"P.Carroll\"&gt;P.Carroll&lt;/a&gt; \u2022 &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Hennessy\"&gt;Arthur Hennessy&lt;/a&gt; (coach)\nLower Grades.\nThe NSWRFL held two lower grade competitions in 1909.\nWith varying consistency, results were published in newspapers: \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", \"The Evening News\", \"The Sunday Times\", \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"The Sunday Sun\". The first three are currently available in digital format on the National Library of Australia's &lt;a href=\"Trove\"&gt;Trove&lt;/a&gt; website. The latter two newspapers are available on microfilm at the State Library of NSW. The results published in these newspapers have been used to compile the tables below, particularly \"The Sunday Sun\" which published the most lower grade results.\nSecond Grade.\nEight teams competed in the Second Grade competition: Balmain, Eastern Suburbs, Glebe, North Sydney, South Sydney, Sydney and Western Suburbs. \nSecond grade followed the same draw as First Grade, with the exception that Sydney replaced Newcastle. Many but not all second grade matches were played on the same ground used later that day for first grade matches involving the same pairing of clubs. \nLeague points: for win = 2; for draw = 1; for loss = 0.\nPld = Games played (excluding forfeits); W = Wins; D = Draws; L = Losses; PF = Points scored in matches; PA = Points conceded in matches; PD = Points difference; WF = Forfeits received; LF = Forfeits conceded; NP = Matches not played due to the probable withdrawal of Western Suburbs; Pts = Competition Points.\nFixtures = Number of fixtures.\nThe semi-finals were played on 14 August. Glebe 15 defeated Sydney 6 at Wentworth Park and Eastern Suburbs 14 beat North Sydney 0 at Birchgrove.\nThe second grade final was played on 4 September as a curtain-raiser to the first Wallabies v Kangaroos match. The two teams had not met since the opening weekend, when Glebe had won by 15 to 3. Eastern Suburbs reversed that result, winning the final, 11 points to 7, to claim the premiership.\nThird Grade.\nNine teams competed in the Third Grade competition: Balmain, Eastern Suburbs, Glebe, South Sydney and Sydney were joined by Drummoyne on 1 May and Rozelle on 22 May. South Sydney Federal were listed to play Newtown on 1 May and 15 May but their first actual match played appears to be on 22 May. All three new clubs began with a win. \nNorth Sydney and Western Suburbs were listed to play in Third Grade on the season opening Saturday, 24 April, but no result was published and they were not subsequently mentioned in Third Grade during 1909.\nThe late withdrawals, late entries, missing results and multiple forfeits make it difficult to reconstruct an accurate competition table.\nLeague points: for win = 2; for draw = 1; for loss = 0.\nP&amp;RK = Games played (excluding forfeits) where the result is known; W = Wins; D = Draws; L = Losses; PF = Points scored in matches where result is known; PA = Points conceded in matches where result is known; PD = Points difference; WF = Forfeits received; LF = Forfeits conceded; Pts = Competition Points from known wins, draws, byes and forfeits received; Unknown = Matches listed as fixtures where the result is not known; Fixtures = Number of fixtures.\nThe semi-finals were played on 14 August at the Royal Agricultural Ground. South Sydney Federal 16 defeated Drummoyne 0 and Rozelle 8 beat Eastern Suburbs 2.\nThe third grade final was played on 21 August as a curtain-raiser to an Australia versus New Zealand Maori match, \"A good game ended in a win for the South Sydney team by 2 points to nil. Turnbull kicked a penalty goal. As the points indicate the tussle was a close one all through.\""
