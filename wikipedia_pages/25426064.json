    "text": "John Aloysius Paton (2 April 1923 \u2013 2 October 2015) was a Scottish professional &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player, &lt;a href=\"Manager%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scout%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; and later a professional &lt;a href=\"snooker\"&gt;snooker&lt;/a&gt; referee. He began his career in Scotland with &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; and played in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brentford%20F.C.\"&gt;Brentford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Watford%20F.C.\"&gt;Watford&lt;/a&gt;. Paton later managed Watford and &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.%20Reserves%231945%E2%80%931999\"&gt;Arsenal 'A'&lt;/a&gt;.\nClub career.\nCeltic.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, Paton joined &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt; (the club he supported as a boy) during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20World%20War\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; in May 1942. An &lt;a href=\"outside%20left\"&gt;outside left&lt;/a&gt;, he made his debut in a 2\u20130 &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League%20%28Scotland%29\"&gt;Southern League&lt;/a&gt; win over &lt;a href=\"St%20Mirren%20F.C.\"&gt;St Mirren&lt;/a&gt; on 16 January 1943.\nDuring the war, Paton spent a period as a guest at &lt;a href=\"American%20Soccer%20League%20%281933%E2%80%9383%29\"&gt;American Soccer League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Americans%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;New York Americans&lt;/a&gt; while stationed in the United States and later guested for &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt; in 1945 in England, making four appearances. He also guested for &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.\"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Millwall%20F.C.\"&gt;Millwall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester City&lt;/a&gt; during the conflict. Paton scored for Celtic in the Victory in Europe Cup triumph over &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Park%20F.C.\"&gt;Queens Park&lt;/a&gt; on 9 May 1945.\nDue to the &lt;a href=\"Association%20football%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;suspension of competitive football&lt;/a&gt; for the duration of the Second World War, Paton didn't make his first professional appearances for Celtic until the &lt;a href=\"1947%E2%80%9348%20Scottish%20First%20Division\"&gt;1947\u201348&lt;/a&gt; season. He made 77 appearances and scored 16 goals before a dispute with the club's management over wages led to his departure from &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20Park\"&gt;Celtic Park&lt;/a&gt; in September 1949. His last competitive game was the 3\u20131 1949 &lt;a href=\"Glasgow%20Cup\"&gt;Glasgow Cup&lt;/a&gt; Final victory over &lt;a href=\"Third%20Lanark%20A.C.\"&gt;Third Lanark&lt;/a&gt;. During the three post-war seasons with Celtic, Paton made 77 appearances and scored 16 goals.\nChelsea (loan).\nPaton joined English &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Loan%20%28sports%29\"&gt;loan&lt;/a&gt; in November 1946. He made 23 appearances and scored three goals before returning to Celtic in May 1947.\nBrentford.\nPaton signed for &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Brentford%20F.C.\"&gt;Brentford&lt;/a&gt; in September 1949 for a \u00a35,000 fee. He had contacted \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Star%20%28London%29\"&gt;London Evening Star&lt;/a&gt;\" columnist (and ex-Arsenal defender) &lt;a href=\"Bernard%20Joy\"&gt;Bernard Joy&lt;/a&gt; and asked for an advert to be placed in the paper that he was available for transfer. Brentford manager (and former Celtic player) &lt;a href=\"Malky%20McDonald\"&gt;Malcolm McDonald&lt;/a&gt; was the first to take up the option on Paton's services. He had a dream start to his career at &lt;a href=\"Griffin%20Park\"&gt;Griffin Park&lt;/a&gt;, scoring on his debut in a 2\u20130 win over &lt;a href=\"Bradford%20Park%20Avenue%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Bradford Park Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and scoring again against &lt;a href=\"Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackburn Rovers&lt;/a&gt; in the following game.\nA knock suffered in a match versus &lt;a href=\"Southampton%20F.C.\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt; on 29 October 1949 hampered his progress, with Paton ruing that he had a \"gammy leg\" for two years, from which he finally recovered after a successful operation at &lt;a href=\"Brentford\"&gt;Brentford&lt;/a&gt; hospital. He played on at Griffin Park until the end of the &lt;a href=\"1951%E2%80%9352%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;1951\u201352&lt;/a&gt; season, by which time he had made 94 appearances and scored 16 goals.\nWatford.\nPaton and Brentford teammate &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Bowie%20%28footballer%20born%201924%29\"&gt;Jimmy Bowie&lt;/a&gt; joined &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South\"&gt;Third Division South&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Watford%20F.C.\"&gt;Watford&lt;/a&gt; in July 1952, to help finance the transfer which had seen &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Lawton\"&gt;Tommy Lawton&lt;/a&gt; move to the Bees the previous year. He made 91 appearances and scored 17 goals before playing his final match in 1955.\nInternational and representative career.\nPaton made appearances for &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; at international level as a schoolboy and a &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association%23Scotland%20Junior%20international%20team\"&gt;junior&lt;/a&gt;. He played for the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Air%20Force\"&gt;RAF&lt;/a&gt; representative team during the Second World War and appeared alongside &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Matthews\"&gt;Stanley Matthews&lt;/a&gt; in the team.\nCoaching and scouting career.\nPaton lamented the standard of football coaching in England in the early 1950s and said \"many managers deliberately starved their players of the ball during the week, believing it made them more hungry for it out on the pitch on a Saturday\". Paton and Brentford teammates &lt;a href=\"Ron%20Greenwood\"&gt;Ron Greenwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Hill\"&gt;Jimmy Hill&lt;/a&gt; enrolled on the first ever &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20Association\"&gt;FA&lt;/a&gt; coaching course at &lt;a href=\"Lilleshall%20Hall\"&gt;Lilleshall&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1950s. One of the instructors was Brentford &lt;a href=\"Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;goalkeeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ted%20Gaskell\"&gt;Ted Gaskell&lt;/a&gt; and Paton roomed with Greenwood, Hill and &lt;a href=\"Malcolm%20Allison\"&gt;Malcolm Allison&lt;/a&gt;. Paton also led the &lt;a href=\"Hertfordshire%20FA\"&gt;Hertfordshire FA&lt;/a&gt;'s youth coaching scheme during the 1954\u201355 season.\nIn the early 1960s, Paton worked as a &lt;a href=\"Scout%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Rotherham%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Rotherham United&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on Glasgow and Scotland. In 1961, &lt;a href=\"Tommy%20Docherty\"&gt;Tommy Docherty&lt;/a&gt; offered Paton a scouting role and the position of &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.%20Reserves%231945%E2%80%931999\"&gt;'A' team&lt;/a&gt; manager at First Division club Arsenal. Paton later found out that Ron Greenwood recommended him for the role. He won the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Metropolitan%20League%20seasons%231961%E2%80%9362\"&gt;1961\u201362&lt;/a&gt; Metropolitan League Cup and the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Metropolitan%20League%20seasons%231962%E2%80%9363\"&gt;1962\u201363 Metropolitan League&lt;/a&gt; title with the 'A' team. He left the club in 1965.\nManagerial career.\nAfter serving Watford as its first-ever &lt;a href=\"player-coach\"&gt;player-coach&lt;/a&gt;, Paton succeeded &lt;a href=\"Len%20Goulden\"&gt;Len Goulden&lt;/a&gt; as manager in October 1955. He had a good start to his reign, but after entering hospital for a &lt;a href=\"cartilage\"&gt;cartilage&lt;/a&gt; operation on both knees, the team's form drained away in his absence. Paton was relieved of his duties only four months into his reign, after just two wins from 15 Third Division South matches.\nPersonal life.\nPaton was born into a family of Celtic supporters, with his grandfather holding a &lt;a href=\"season%20ticket\"&gt;season ticket&lt;/a&gt; at Celtic Park and his father spending time on the club's books as a player. In addition to football, Paton also competed as an &lt;a href=\"amateur%20boxer\"&gt;amateur welterweight boxer&lt;/a&gt; and in athletics as a youth. During the Second World War, he served as a &lt;a href=\"navigator\"&gt;navigator&lt;/a&gt; in the RAF. In the late 1950s, Paton turned his back on football and worked as a &lt;a href=\"press%20photographer\"&gt;press photographer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snooker\"&gt;snooker&lt;/a&gt; referee and as a &lt;a href=\"sales%20rep\"&gt;sales rep&lt;/a&gt;, selling &lt;a href=\"chocolate%20biscuit\"&gt;chocolate biscuit&lt;/a&gt;s. Paton died in October 2015, aged 92."
