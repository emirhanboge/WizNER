    "text": "Tom Williams (born 17 July 1986) is a former &lt;a href=\"Australian%20rules%20football\"&gt;Australian rules football&lt;/a&gt;er with the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Bulldogs\"&gt;Western Bulldogs&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Australian%20Football%20League\"&gt;Australian Football League&lt;/a&gt;. Drafted with the 6th pick in the &lt;a href=\"2004%20AFL%20Draft\"&gt;2004 AFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;, Williams was a late convert to Australian Rules, having been an all-round sportsman, playing representative &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; in U-18s. Williams retired in 2014.\nTom's father Steve played for the &lt;a href=\"Parramatta%20Eels\"&gt;Parramatta Eels&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League\"&gt;New South Wales Rugby League&lt;/a&gt; between 1975 and 1976 and was a co-founder of the &lt;a href=\"Brisbane%20Broncos\"&gt;Brisbane Broncos&lt;/a&gt;.\nWilliams was identified as a talent by &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Browning\"&gt;Mark Browning&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Swans\"&gt;Sydney Swan&lt;/a&gt; turned &lt;a href=\"AFL%20Queensland\"&gt;AFL Queensland&lt;/a&gt; talent manager. He was rushed into the 2004 Under 18 championships having played just 15 games of Australian rules football, from which he was taken as the Bulldogs first round pick in the draft.\nDespite having broken his ankle three times since joining the club, Williams has shown promise of becoming a key position defender, giving the club plenty of reason to keep him on the list.\nWilliams made his debut against Richmond in round four of the &lt;a href=\"2007%20AFL%20season\"&gt;2007 AFL season&lt;/a&gt; where the Bulldogs registered a victory against &lt;a href=\"Richmond%20Football%20Club\"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt;. Willams played well enough to earn a &lt;a href=\"NAB%20Rising%20Star\"&gt;NAB Rising Star&lt;/a&gt; nomination in round 18.\nStatistics.\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | &lt;a href=\"2007%20AFL%20season\"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | &lt;a href=\"2008%20AFL%20season\"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | &lt;a href=\"2009%20AFL%20season\"&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | &lt;a href=\"2010%20AFL%20season\"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | &lt;a href=\"2011%20AFL%20season\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | &lt;a href=\"2012%20AFL%20season\"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | &lt;a href=\"2013%20AFL%20season\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | &lt;a href=\"2014%20AFL%20season\"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 85\n! 14\n! 12\n! 534\n! 393\n! 927\n! 356\n! 114\n! 0.2\n! 0.1\n! 6.3\n! 4.6\n! 10.9\n! 4.2\n! 1.3\nVictoria Harbour incident.\nOn 4 October 2007, Williams and fellow team member &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Cross%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Daniel Cross&lt;/a&gt; leaped into the water of &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20Harbour\"&gt;Victoria Harbour&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; to rescue a woman attempting to commit suicide.
