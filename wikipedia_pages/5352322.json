    "text": "The International Holocaust Remembrance Day, or the International Day in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust, is an &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20minor%20secular%20observances%23January\"&gt;international memorial day&lt;/a&gt; on 27 January that commemorates the victims of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Holocaust\"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the murder of one third of the Jewish people, along with countless members of other minorities between 1933 and 1945 by &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt to implement their \"&lt;a href=\"Final%20Solution\"&gt;final solution&lt;/a&gt;\" to the &lt;a href=\"Jewish%20question\"&gt;Jewish question&lt;/a&gt;. 27 January was chosen to commemorate the date that &lt;a href=\"Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;Auschwitz concentration camp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp\"&gt;was liberated&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; in 1945.\nThe day remembers the killing of six million Jews, two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population, and millions of others by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. It was designated by &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly%20resolution\"&gt;United Nations General Assembly resolution&lt;/a&gt; 60/7 on 1 November 2005. The resolution came after a special session was held earlier that year on 24 January to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20concentration%20camps\"&gt;Nazi concentration camps&lt;/a&gt; and the end of the Holocaust.\nMany countries have instituted their own &lt;a href=\"Holocaust%20Memorial%20Days\"&gt;Holocaust Memorial Days&lt;/a&gt;. Many, such as the UK's &lt;a href=\"Holocaust%20Memorial%20Day%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Holocaust Memorial Day&lt;/a&gt;, also fall on 27 January, while others, such as Israel's &lt;a href=\"Yom%20HaShoah\"&gt;Yom HaShoah&lt;/a&gt;, are observed at other times of the year.\nThe General Assembly Resolution 60/7.\nResolution 60/7 establishing 27 January as International Holocaust Remembrance Day urges every member nation of the U.N. to honor the memory of Holocaust victims, six million Jews, \u201cone third of the Jewish people, along with countless members of other minorities,\u201d and encourages the development of educational programs about Holocaust history to help prevent future acts of &lt;a href=\"genocide\"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;. It rejects any &lt;a href=\"Holocaust%20denial\"&gt;denial of the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; as an event and condemns all manifestations of &lt;a href=\"religious%20intolerance\"&gt;religious intolerance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"incitement\"&gt;incitement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"harassment\"&gt;harassment&lt;/a&gt; or violence against persons or communities based on ethnic origin or religious belief. It also calls for actively preserving the Holocaust sites that served as Nazi death camps, concentration camps, forced labor camps and prisons, as well as for establishing a U.N. programme of outreach and mobilization of society for Holocaust &lt;a href=\"memorialization\"&gt;remembrance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"peace%20education\"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;.\nResolution 60/7 and the International Holocaust Day was an initiative of the State of Israel. Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Israel, &lt;a href=\"Silvan%20Shalom\"&gt;Silvan Shalom&lt;/a&gt;, was the head of the delegation of Israel to the United Nations.\nThe essence of the text lies in its twofold approach: one that deals with the memory and remembrance of those who were massacred during the Holocaust and the other with educating future generations of its horrors.\nThe International Day in memory of the victims of the Holocaust is thus a day on which we must reassert our commitment to human rights. [...]\nWe must also go beyond remembrance, and make sure that new generations know this history. We must apply the lessons of the Holocaust to today\u2019s world. And we must do our utmost so that all peoples may enjoy the protection and rights for which the United Nations stands.\n \u2014 \"Message by Secretary-General &lt;a href=\"Ban%20Ki-Moon\"&gt;Ban Ki-Moon&lt;/a&gt; for the second observance of the Holocaust Victims Memorial Day on 19 January 2008\"\nCommemorations at the United Nations.\nIn 2006, 2007 and 2008, Holocaust Remembrance Weeks were organized by &lt;a href=\"The%20Holocaust%20and%20the%20United%20Nations%20Outreach%20Programme\"&gt;The Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme&lt;/a&gt;. This programme is part of the Outreach Division of the United Nations Department of Public Information and was established under General Assembly resolution 60/7.\nIn 2006.\nOn 24 January, the opening of the Holocaust Remembrance Week took place at &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Headquarters\"&gt;United Nations Headquarters&lt;/a&gt; with the unveiling of an exhibit \"No Child's Play \u2013 Remembrance and Beyond\" in the Visitors' Lobby. This travelling exhibit, produced by &lt;a href=\"Yad%20Vashem\"&gt;Yad Vashem&lt;/a&gt;, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem, opened a window into the world of children during the Shoah. It focused on toys, games, artwork, diaries and poems highlighting some of the personal stories of the children and providing a glimpse into their lives during the Holocaust. The exhibition told the story of survival \u2013 the struggle of these children to hold on to life.\nOn 25 January the screening of the movie \"&lt;a href=\"Fateless%20%28film%29\"&gt;Fateless&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Lajos%20Koltai\"&gt;Lajos Koltai&lt;/a&gt; took place in the Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Auditorium.\nOn 27 January, the United Nations Department of Public Information held the first universal observance of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day at United Nations Headquarters.\nIn the General Assembly Hall a memorial ceremony and lecture was held under the theme \"Remembrance and Beyond\".

Statements were then made by Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa, president of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly, and Ambassador Dan Gillerman, Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations. The keynote \"Remembrance and Beyond\" address was given by Madame &lt;a href=\"Simone%20Veil\"&gt;Simone Veil&lt;/a&gt;, a Holocaust survivor, president of the &lt;a href=\"Fondation%20pour%20la%20M%C3%A9moire%20de%20la%20Shoah\"&gt;Fondation pour la M\u00e9moire de la Shoah&lt;/a&gt; and a member of the Constitutional Council of France.\nThe observance focused on the importance of infusing today's youth with the lessons of the Holocaust so that future generations may work to prevent hatred, bigotry, racism and prejudice. Marie Noel, a student at the College of Saint Elizabeth, shared her experiences visiting former concentration camps in Poland.\nThe memorial ceremony also focused on the disabled community as one of the many victim groups of the Nazi regime. Thomas Schindlmayr of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs highlighted the importance of education in promoting tolerance and ending discrimination against all &lt;a href=\"minority%20group\"&gt;minorities&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in light of the adoption by the General Assembly on 13 December 2006 of the landmark &lt;a href=\"Convention%20on%20the%20Rights%20of%20Persons%20with%20Disabilities\"&gt;Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, a musical performance was given by HaZamir: The International Jewish High School Chamber Choir, a project of the Zamir Choral Foundation, founded and directed by Matthew Lazar. Netanel Hershtik, cantor of the New York Synagogue, recited the \"&lt;a href=\"Kaddish\"&gt;Kaddish&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDuring the observance the United Nations Department of Public Information also launched a new website and resource for United Nations member states, educators and non-governmental organizations entitled \"Electronic Notes for Speakers\" developed for the Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme by Yad Vashem \u2013 the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes Remembrance Authority, Jerusalem, and the &lt;a href=\"USC%20Shoah%20Foundation\"&gt;USC Shoah Foundation&lt;/a&gt; Institute for Visual History and Education and the &lt;a href=\"M%C3%A9morial%20de%20la%20Shoah\"&gt;M\u00e9morial de la Shoah&lt;/a&gt; in Paris. The electronic notes provide &lt;a href=\"Holocaust%20survivors%23Memoirs%20and%20testimonies\"&gt;survivor testimony&lt;/a&gt; and information materials that will equip speakers with the tools needed to conduct briefings on the Holocaust and lessons to be learned from it.\nThe United Nations bookstore made available ten volumes of autobiographical accounts of Holocaust survivors published jointly by The Holocaust Survivors' Memoirs Project and Yad Vashem \u2013 the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes Remembrance Authority. An initiative of Nobel Peace Prize laureate &lt;a href=\"Elie%20Wiesel\"&gt;Elie Wiesel&lt;/a&gt;, the Holocaust Survivors' Memoirs Project has collected over 900 manuscripts. Its mission is to provide both the victims and the survivors of the Holocaust with the dignity of a permanent historical presence, not as impersonal statistics but as individuals with names, voices and emotions. The United Nations bookstore also had a discussion by &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Mendelsohn\"&gt;Daniel Mendelsohn&lt;/a&gt; about his book \"The Lost: A Search for Six of the Six Million\".\nThe Department of Public Information also marked the Holocaust Remembrance Week with two exhibits in the United Nations visitors' lobby. The first, entitled \"The Holocaust against the Sinti and Roma and Present Day Racism in Europe\", focused on the experience of the Roma and Sinti during the Holocaust. The second exhibit featured artwork, created by Holocaust survivors, exploring the meaning and experience of the Holocaust.\nOn 31 January, a special screening of \"Volevo solo Vivere\" (\"I Only Wanted to Live\"), directed by &lt;a href=\"Mimmo%20Calopresti\"&gt;Mimmo Calopresti&lt;/a&gt;, took place. The film tells the moving story of nine Italian survivors of Auschwitz. The following day \"Nazvy svoie im'ia\" (\"Spell Your Name\"), directed by Serhiy Bukovsky, was also screened. The film, about the Holocaust in Ukraine, tells the story of local people who escaped brutal execution and those who rescued friends and neighbours during the Holocaust. Both films, produced by USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, were shown in the Dag Hammarskjold Library Auditorium. On 2 February, the third discussion paper in the Holocaust and Genocide series was published, about Hitler, Pol Pot and Hutu Power.\nIn 2008.\nThroughout the week of 28 January 2008, the United Nations Department of Public Information organized a number of events around the world to remember the victims of the Holocaust and underscore the value of human life. The 2008 observance focused on the need to ensure the protection of human rights for all. It coincided with the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights\"&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;.\nHolocaust Remembrance Day began with the joint launch of a new United Nations Holocaust Remembrance postage stamp issued simultaneously, for the first time, with a national stamp by the Israel Postal Company. The two stamps bear the same design.\nOn 28 January 2008, at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the daughter of United States Congressman &lt;a href=\"Tom%20Lantos\"&gt;Tom Lantos&lt;/a&gt;, himself a Holocaust survivor, delivered a keynote address \"Civic Responsibility and the Preservation of Democratic Values\" at the memorial ceremony and concert held in the General Assembly Hall.\nOther speakers included Srgjan Kerim (Macedonia), president of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly, Ambassador Dan Gillerman, Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations, and Kiyo Akasaka, Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information.\nThe ceremony also featured a concert with the Tel Aviv University Buchmann-Mehta School of Music symphony orchestra in cooperation with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by maestro Zubin Mehta.\nOn 30 January 2008, the first permanent exhibit on the Holocaust and the United Nations was unveiled.

At the United Nations office in Ukraine a round-table discussion was organized in partnership with the Ministry of Education and the Ukrainian Holocaust Study Centre. In Tokyo on 29 January, an educational workshop targeting young students focused on the links between the Holocaust and human rights issues. \nAlso, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum provided information material in English and Spanish to a number of United Nations information centers for use in their reference libraries.\nTo help carry out its educational mission, the Department of Public Information participated in a panel discussion with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (&lt;a href=\"UNESCO\"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt;) in the afternoon of 28 January to highlight the importance of Holocaust education, organized by &lt;a href=\"B%27nai%20B%27rith\"&gt;B'nai B'rith&lt;/a&gt; International.\nA second exhibit, \"Carl Lutz and the Legendary Glass House in Budapest\", was co-sponsored by the Carl Lutz Foundation and the Permanent Missions of Switzerland and Hungary. &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Lutz\"&gt;Carl Lutz&lt;/a&gt;, the Swiss Vice-Consul in Budapest, had issued certificates of emigration to place tens of thousands of Jews under Swiss protection.\nIn 2019.\nIn January 2019, Albanian Ambassador to the UN &lt;a href=\"Besiana%20Kadare\"&gt;Besiana Kadare&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of Albania co-hosted together with the &lt;a href=\"World%20Jewish%20Congress\"&gt;World Jewish Congress&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations%20Department%20of%20Global%20Communications\"&gt;United Nations Department of Global Communications&lt;/a&gt; an event on the theme \"A story of humanity: the rescue of Jews in Albania\".
