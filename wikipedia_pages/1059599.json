    "title": "Hypophosphatemia",
    "text": " \nHypophosphatemia is an &lt;a href=\"electrolyte%20disorder\"&gt;electrolyte disorder&lt;/a&gt; in which there is a low level of &lt;a href=\"phosphate\"&gt;phosphate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"blood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms may include weakness, trouble breathing, and loss of appetite. Complications may include &lt;a href=\"seizures\"&gt;seizures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coma\"&gt;coma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rhabdomyolysis\"&gt;rhabdomyolysis&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"osteomalacia\"&gt;softening of the bones&lt;/a&gt;.\nCauses include &lt;a href=\"alcohol%20use%20disorder\"&gt;alcohol use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"refeeding%20syndrome\"&gt;refeeding&lt;/a&gt; in those with &lt;a href=\"malnutrition\"&gt;malnutrition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diabetic%20ketoacidosis\"&gt;diabetic ketoacidosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burn\"&gt;burns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hyperventilation\"&gt;hyperventilation&lt;/a&gt;, and certain medications. It may also occur in the setting of &lt;a href=\"hyperparathyroidism\"&gt;hyperparathyroidism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hypothyroidism\"&gt;hypothyroidism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cushing%20syndrome\"&gt;Cushing syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. It is diagnosed based on a blood phosphate concentration of less than 0.81 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). When levels are below 0.32 mmol/L (1.0 mg/dL) it is deemed to be severe.\nTreatment depends on the underlying cause. Phosphate may be given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Hypophosphatemia occurs in about 2% of people within hospital and 70% of people in the &lt;a href=\"intensive%20care%20unit\"&gt;intensive care unit&lt;/a&gt; (ICU).\nCauses.\nPrimary hypophosphatemia is the most common cause of non-nutritional &lt;a href=\"rickets\"&gt;rickets&lt;/a&gt;. Laboratory findings include low-normal serum &lt;a href=\"calcium\"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;, moderately low serum &lt;a href=\"phosphate\"&gt;phosphate&lt;/a&gt;, elevated serum &lt;a href=\"alkaline%20phosphatase\"&gt;alkaline phosphatase&lt;/a&gt;, and low serum 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D levels, &lt;a href=\"hyperphosphaturia\"&gt;hyperphosphaturia&lt;/a&gt;, and no evidence of &lt;a href=\"hyperparathyroidism\"&gt;hyperparathyroidism&lt;/a&gt;.\nHypophosphatemia decreases 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) causing a left shift in the oxyhemoglobin curve.\nOther rarer causes include:\nPathophysiology.\nHypophosphatemia is caused by the following three mechanisms:\nDiagnosis.\nHypophosphatemia is diagnosed by measuring the concentration of phosphate in the blood. Concentrations of phosphate less than 0.81 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) are considered diagnostic of hypophosphatemia, though additional tests may be needed to identify the underlying cause of the disorder.\nTreatment.\nStandard intravenous preparations of potassium phosphate are available and are routinely used in malnourished people and people who consume excessive amounts of alcohol. Supplementation by mouth is also useful where no intravenous treatment are available. Historically one of the first demonstrations of this was in people in concentration camp who died soon after being re-fed: it was observed that those given milk (high in phosphate) had a higher survival rate than those who did not get &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonitoring parameters during correction with IV phosphate"
