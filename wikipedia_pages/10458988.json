It is spread linearly along the banks of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Hooghly\"&gt;River Hooghly&lt;/a&gt; in a north-south direction. Much of the city was originally a vast wetland, reclaimed over the decades to accommodate the city's burgeoning population. The remaining wetland, known as &lt;a href=\"East%20Calcutta%20Wetlands\"&gt;East Calcutta Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; has been designated a \"wetland of international importance\" under the &lt;a href=\"Ramsar%20Convention\"&gt;Ramsar Convention&lt;/a&gt;.\n96% of the population of &lt;a href=\"Barrackpore%20subdivision\"&gt;Barrackpore subdivision&lt;/a&gt; (partly presented in the map alongside) live in urban areas. In 2011, it had a density of population of 10,967 per km2 The subdivision has 16 municipalities and 24 census towns.\nPhysical features.\nLike the most of the &lt;a href=\"Indo-Gangetic%20plain\"&gt;Indo-Gangetic plain&lt;/a&gt;s, the predominant soil and water type is &lt;a href=\"alluvial\"&gt;alluvial&lt;/a&gt;. Quaternary sediments consisting of clay, silt, various grades of sand and gravel underlie the city. These sediments are sandwiched between two clay beds, the lower one at depths between and and the upper one ranging between and in thickness.

Also, a sizeable portion of the youths are engaged in the foreign and Indian Multinational companies who are opening their offices in the Salt Lake and Rajarhat area of Kolkata.\nHistory.\nThe name of Shyamngar came from a folk etymology of Samne+ garh (\u09b8\u09be\u09ae\u09a8\u09c7+ \u0997\u09a2\u09bc), which in course of time changed to Shyamnagar.\nDuring the rule of Raja &lt;a href=\"Krishnachandra%20Roy\"&gt;Krishnachandra Roy&lt;/a&gt; of Krishnanagar, the king gave the village called 'Mulajore' along with a title of Roy Gunakar to his court poet &lt;a href=\"Bharatchandra%20Ray\"&gt;Bharatchandra Ray&lt;/a&gt;. In memory of Bharat Chandra Roy Gunakar there is an old and historic library named Bharat Chandra Library, established in 1906. It is situated close to the railway station.\nRelatives of Rabindranath Tagore had set up Mulajor Kalibari at Shyamnagar in North 24 Parganas and it is unknown to many people. The temple beside &lt;a href=\"Hooghly%20River\"&gt;Hooghly River&lt;/a&gt; is very eye soothing. One of the priests said the temple was constructed on 31 Baishakh in 1219 Bengali year around 200 years ago beside Hooghly River even before Dakhineswar Kali temple was set up by &lt;a href=\"Rani%20Rashmoni\"&gt;Rani Rashmoni&lt;/a&gt; Devi. Six priests are engaged for offering puja to goddess Kali and one of the temple priests said. \"No dedicated book had been written on this temple and gradually history is fading away but we know relatives of Rabindranath Tagore constructed this temple\".\nSrijit Thakur is the surviving member of the Thakur family whose ancestors set up the temple, lives in \"Rajbari\" at Pathuriaghata Street near Natunbazar in Kolkata. According to the biographer of Rabindranath Tagore, &lt;a href=\"Prabhat%20Kumar%20Mukhopadhyaya\"&gt;Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyaya&lt;/a&gt;, the original surname of the &lt;a href=\"Tagore%20family\"&gt;Tagores&lt;/a&gt; was Kushari. They were &lt;a href=\"Bengali%20Brahmins\"&gt;Rarhi Brahmins&lt;/a&gt; and originally belonged to a village named Kush in the district named &lt;a href=\"Bardhaman%20district\"&gt;Burdwan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;. Rabindranath Tagore's ancestor Dinanath Kushari, the son of &lt;a href=\"Bhatta%20Narayana\"&gt;Bhatta Narayana&lt;/a&gt; was a native of this village. Generations later different branches of the Kusharis migrated to different parts of Bengal; one of the branches migrated to &lt;a href=\"Jessore%20District\"&gt;Jessore District&lt;/a&gt; and settled there. One of the descendants Panchanan Kushari later came back from &lt;a href=\"Jessore%20District\"&gt;Jessore District&lt;/a&gt; in East Bengal to &lt;a href=\"West%20Bengal\"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt; and settled in &lt;a href=\"Gobindapur%2C%20Kolkata\"&gt;Gobindopur&lt;/a&gt;. \"Panchanan got the title thakur since then his family member used to write the title Thakur instead of Kusari,\" said a priest. Jairam Thakur (Kusari) was latter generation had four sons- Anandiram, Nilmoni, Darpanarayan and Gobindaram. Prince &lt;a href=\"Dwarkanath%20Tagore\"&gt;Dwarkanath Tagore&lt;/a&gt; was the next generation of Anandiram, whose son was Debendranath and Rabindranath was his eighth son. Debendranath, however, became Brahmo and did not believe in idol worshipping. It had not been known whether he or his sons ever visited the temple. Gopimohan Thakur, the son of Darpanarayan founded the temple. Gopimohan had two sons Prsanna Kumar and Harakumar and daughter Brahmamoyee.\nPrasanna Kumar had one son Pradyot Kumar and Harakumar had Jatindromohan. Surviving member Srijit Thakur is the son of Prabirendro Mohan, who was the son of Pradyot Kumar. According to local tale that the present place of the Kali temple was occupied of 'Nandi' (caste) and 'Pirali' so experienced priest from 'Bhatpara toll (Sanskrit educational institution)\u2019 used to refuse offering puja to the goddess Mulajore Shyamnagar Kali as a result priests were brought from &lt;a href=\"Bankura\"&gt;Bankura&lt;/a&gt;, Burdwan and other places. Later a Sanskrit College was set up by the king Gopimohan Thakur as a matter of pride and to make erudite Sanskrit students. Students were accommodated in this college hostel they used to take Prasad in the temple as a lunch and dinner. Ramkumar Chattopadhyaya, elder brother of Ramakrishna Dev was the student of this college. But instead of reconstructing that dilapidated building, a heritage building of the locality with its Ionic pillars Rabindra Bhawan was set up by municipality replacing the college, ignoring the sense of heritage.\nOverview.\nShyamnagar is situated on the east bank of the Ganges.

An auditorium named Rabindra Bhavan was built by &lt;a href=\"Bhatpara\"&gt;Bhatpara&lt;/a&gt; Municipality by the side of this Kali Temple. It was said that there was a Sanskrit College in the Nineteenth century and Pandit &lt;a href=\"Ishwar%20Chandra%20Vidyasagar\"&gt;Vidyasagar&lt;/a&gt; used to visit over there. A fair called &lt;a href=\"Poush%20Mela\"&gt;Poush Mela&lt;/a&gt; is organised every year in Poush Mash according to Bengali calendar and between December and January in English calendar.
