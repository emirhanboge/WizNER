    "text": "The Taipei European School () is a European &lt;a href=\"international%20school\"&gt;international school&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shilin%20District\"&gt;Shilin District&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Taipei\"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a British section, a German section, and a French section.\nTaipei European School (TES) is registered as a legal entity in the form of a nonprofit foundation supervised by the Department of Education within the &lt;a href=\"Taipei%20City%20Government\"&gt;Taipei City Government&lt;/a&gt;.\nTES integrates its German, British, and French sections in terms of their curricula, administration, finance, buildings and facilities. The Taipei British School (TBS), \u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise de Taipei (EFT) and Deutsche Schule Taipei (DST) were established around 1990 to serve expatriate families with young children living in Taipei. Shortly afterwards, the schools joined together to establish a combined European campus, in which the schools share facilities and resources but teach their own respective national curricula.\nThe school has an enrollment of more than 1800 students from around 57 countries. TES is authorized by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Baccalaureate%20Organization\"&gt;International Baccalaureate Organization&lt;/a&gt; to run the Diploma program, and is classed as an IB World School. TES is also a member of the &lt;a href=\"Federation%20of%20British%20International%20Schools%20in%20Asia\"&gt;Federation of British International Schools in Asia&lt;/a&gt; (FOBISIA) and affiliated to &lt;a href=\"Agence%20pour%20l%27Enseignement%20Fran%C3%A7ais%20%C3%A0%20l%27%C3%89tranger\"&gt;Agence pour l'Enseignement Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 l'\u00c9tranger&lt;/a&gt; (AEFE) and &lt;a href=\"Central%20Agency%20for%20German%20Schools%20Abroad\"&gt;Bundesverwaltungsamt-Zentralstelle f\u00fcr das Auslandsschulwesen&lt;/a&gt; (BVA-ZfA).\nCampuses.\nThe Taipei European School operates on two campuses: Swire European Primary Campus (EPC) at Wenlin Road and Swire European Secondary Campus (ESC) at JianYe Road on Yang Ming Shan.\nSwire European Primary Campus \u2013 Fuguo Road (\u798f\u570b\u8def\uff09.\nSwire European Primary Campus was completed in 2007 and consists of three buildings: the Central Resource Area (CRA), the Infant Building and the Junior Building. The Central Resource Area is a four-story building which houses common facilities such as the cafeteria, the library, a multi-purpose room, the Parents' Caf\u00e9, administrative offices, the uniform shop, a maintenance room and an underground car park. It is connected both to the Infant Building and to the Junior Building.\nThe two-story Infant Building contains general classrooms for students aged 3 to 7 years old from the German, British and French Sections, as well as shared specialist facilities. A multi-purpose room, an outdoor playground with play structures, as well as grassed and astroturfed areas, are also located in the Infant Wing.\nThe five-story Junior Building houses general classrooms for students aged 7 to 11 years old from the German, British and French Sections, and includes shared specialist teaching facilities. There is an outdoor play area as well as two astroturf sport fields.\nSwire European Secondary Campus \u2013 Yang Ming Shan (\u967d\u660e\u5c71).\nThere are three buildings in the secondary campus which are referred to as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3. The construction of Phase 1 was completed in 1998, the construction of Phase 2 in 2002 and the construction of Phase 3 in late 2019. All three buildings are four floors high.\nThe Phase I building contains specialists rooms including a music suite, a library, two computer labs, a multi-media room, three science labs, a fine art and 3D art room, a drama and performance area, an outdoor basketball court, a cafeteria, and an atrium.\nThe Phase II building contains physics and chemistry labs, a library, a cafeteria, three computer labs, four science labs, two art rooms, an indoor gymnasium, a sport field, two outdoor basketball courts, and a large atrium.\nThe Phase III building has 30 large classrooms, 2 gymnasiums, a fitness room and a dance studio.\nStudent body.\nCurrently, Taipei European School has around 1,800 students, with British section students as the majority.\nStudents originate largely from Europe and North America, with British, French, German, American, and Canadian as the dominating nationalities. There are also students from Latin America, Africa, Singapore, Japan, and Korea. The school has students and faculty from over 50 different countries.\nThere are four headteachers running the four sections, under the supervision of the TES CEO David Gatley:\nThe primary section, for students aged between 3 and 11, is located in the Wenlin Campus, and currently enrolls 1078 students.\nThe British Secondary Section (Key Stage Three) is located in the &lt;a href=\"Yang%20Ming%20Shan\"&gt;Yang Ming Shan&lt;/a&gt; campus.

It offers the &lt;a href=\"International%20General%20Certificate%20of%20Secondary%20Education\"&gt;International General Certificate of Secondary Education&lt;/a&gt; (IGCSE) program for the H1-H2s, the international equivalent of the British &lt;a href=\"GCSE\"&gt;GCSE&lt;/a&gt; examinations.

For those who do not meet the requirements for IB, TES students can also take a TES diploma.\nSports.\nTES students compete in the U13 and U15 FOBISIA, an annual international interscholastic sporting tournament between British international schools in Asia.
