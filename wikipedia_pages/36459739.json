Sunday was really great and things are looking absolutely bright right now,\u201d says Ranjith Sankar.\"\nAnand Hrishikesh on Flixmirror rates it 2.5/5 commenting \"It seems the recent trend is in showcasing social issues and Malayalam film sticks to the same old routines that if one film on a particular subject becomes a hit follow the pattern and create similar films. Overall Ranjith Shankar's Molly Aunty fails to rock in the hearts of a viewer and does not leave a long lasting impression once you are out of the cinema hall.\""
