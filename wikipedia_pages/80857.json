    "text": "In the mathematical field of &lt;a href=\"complex%20analysis\"&gt;complex analysis&lt;/a&gt;, a meromorphic function on an &lt;a href=\"open%20set\"&gt;open subset&lt;/a&gt; \"D\" of the &lt;a href=\"complex%20plane\"&gt;complex plane&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"function%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt; that is &lt;a href=\"holomorphic%20function\"&gt;holomorphic&lt;/a&gt; on all of \"D\" \"except\" for a set of &lt;a href=\"isolated%20point\"&gt;isolated point&lt;/a&gt;s, which are &lt;a href=\"pole%20%28complex%20analysis%29\"&gt;pole&lt;/a&gt;s of the function. The term comes from the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Greek\"&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; \"meros\" (&lt;a href=\"wikt%3A%CE%BC%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82\"&gt;\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2&lt;/a&gt;), meaning \"part\".\nEvery meromorphic function on \"D\" can be expressed as the ratio between two &lt;a href=\"holomorphic%20function\"&gt;holomorphic function&lt;/a&gt;s (with the denominator not constant 0) defined on \"D\": any pole must coincide with a zero of the denominator.\nHeuristic description.\nIntuitively, a meromorphic function is a ratio of two well-behaved (holomorphic) functions. Such a function will still be well-behaved, except possibly at the points where the denominator of the fraction is zero. If the denominator has a zero at \"z\" and the numerator does not, then the value of the function will approach infinity; if both parts have a zero at \"z\", then one must compare the &lt;a href=\"Multiplicity%20%28mathematics%29%23Multiplicity%20of%20a%20root%20of%20a%20polynomial\"&gt;multiplicity&lt;/a&gt; of these zeros.\nFrom an algebraic point of view, if the function's domain is &lt;a href=\"connected%20set\"&gt;connected&lt;/a&gt;, then the set of meromorphic functions is the &lt;a href=\"field%20of%20fractions\"&gt;field of fractions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"integral%20domain\"&gt;integral domain&lt;/a&gt; of the set of holomorphic functions. This is analogous to the relationship between the &lt;a href=\"rational%20number\"&gt;rational number&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"integer\"&gt;integer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPrior, alternate use.\nBoth the field of study wherein the term is used and the precise meaning of the term changed in the 20th\u00a0century. In the 1930s, in &lt;a href=\"group%20theory\"&gt;group theory&lt;/a&gt;, a \"meromorphic function\" (or \"meromorph\") was a function from a group \"G\" into itself that preserved the product on the group. The image of this function was called an \"automorphism\" of \"G\". Similarly, a \"homomorphic function\" (or \"homomorph\") was a function between groups that preserved the product, while a \"homomorphism\" was the image of a homomorph. This form of the term is now obsolete, and the related term \"meromorph\" is no longer used in group theory.\nThe term \"&lt;a href=\"endomorphism\"&gt;endomorphism&lt;/a&gt;\" is now used for the function itself, with no special name given to the image of the function. \nA meromorphic function is not necessarily an endomorphism, since the complex points at its poles are not in its domain, but may be in its range.\nProperties.\nSince the poles of a meromorphic function are isolated, there are at most &lt;a href=\"countable\"&gt;countably&lt;/a&gt; many. The set of poles can be infinite, as exemplified by the function formula_1\nBy using &lt;a href=\"analytic%20continuation\"&gt;analytic continuation&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate &lt;a href=\"removable%20singularity\"&gt;removable singularities&lt;/a&gt;, meromorphic functions can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and the quotient formula_2 can be formed unless formula_3 on a &lt;a href=\"connected%20space\"&gt;connected component&lt;/a&gt; of \"D\". Thus, if \"D\" is connected, the meromorphic functions form a &lt;a href=\"field%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;field&lt;/a&gt;, in fact a &lt;a href=\"field%20extension\"&gt;field extension&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"complex%20numbers\"&gt;complex numbers&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigher dimensions.\nIn &lt;a href=\"several%20complex%20variables\"&gt;several complex variables&lt;/a&gt;, a meromorphic function is defined to be locally a quotient of two holomorphic functions. For example, formula_4 is a meromorphic function on the two-dimensional complex affine space. Here it is no longer true that every meromorphic function can be regarded as a holomorphic function with values in the &lt;a href=\"Riemann%20sphere\"&gt;Riemann sphere&lt;/a&gt;: There is a set of \"indeterminacy\" of &lt;a href=\"codimension\"&gt;codimension&lt;/a&gt; two (in the given example this set consists of the origin formula_5).\nUnlike in dimension one, in higher dimensions there do exist compact &lt;a href=\"complex%20manifold\"&gt;complex manifold&lt;/a&gt;s on which there are no non-constant meromorphic functions, for example, most &lt;a href=\"complex%20torus\"&gt;complex tori&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn Riemann surfaces.\nOn a &lt;a href=\"Riemann%20surface\"&gt;Riemann surface&lt;/a&gt;, every point admits an open neighborhood\nwhich is &lt;a href=\"biholomorphism\"&gt;biholomorphic&lt;/a&gt; to an open subset of the complex plane. Thereby the notion of a meromorphic function can be defined for every Riemann surface.\nWhen \"D\" is the entire &lt;a href=\"Riemann%20sphere\"&gt;Riemann sphere&lt;/a&gt;, the field of meromorphic functions is simply the field of rational functions in one variable over the complex field, since one can prove that any meromorphic function on the sphere is rational. (This is a special case of the so-called &lt;a href=\"GAGA\"&gt;GAGA&lt;/a&gt; principle.)\nFor every &lt;a href=\"Riemann%20surface\"&gt;Riemann surface&lt;/a&gt;, a meromorphic function is the same as a holomorphic function that maps to the Riemann sphere and which is not the constant function equal to \u221e. The poles correspond to those complex numbers which are mapped to \u221e.\nOn a non-compact &lt;a href=\"Riemann%20surface\"&gt;Riemann surface&lt;/a&gt;, every meromorphic function can be realized as a quotient of two (globally defined) holomorphic functions. In contrast, on a compact Riemann surface, every holomorphic function is constant, while there always exist non-constant meromorphic functions."
