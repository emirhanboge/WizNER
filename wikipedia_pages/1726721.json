    "text": "Edward Ochab (; 16 August 1906 \u2013 1 May 1989) was a Polish &lt;a href=\"Communism\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; politician and top leader of &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; between March and October 1956.\nAs a member of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Communist Party of Poland&lt;/a&gt; from 1929, he was repeatedly imprisoned for his activities under the &lt;a href=\"Sanation\"&gt;Polish government&lt;/a&gt; of the time. In 1939 Ochab participated in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Warsaw%20%281939%29\"&gt;Defense of Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; but afterwards moved to the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, where he became an early organizer and manager in the &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Polish%20Patriots\"&gt;Union of Polish Patriots&lt;/a&gt;. In 1943, he joined &lt;a href=\"First%20Polish%20Army%20%281944%E2%80%9345%29\"&gt;General Berling's Polish Army on the Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"political%20commissar\"&gt;political commissar&lt;/a&gt; and quickly advanced in its ranks. From 1944 he was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Committee\"&gt;Central Committee&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Polish Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (PPR) and a deputy in the &lt;a href=\"State%20National%20Council\"&gt;State National Council&lt;/a&gt;. In 1945, he became minister of public administration and held the successive positions of propaganda chief in the PPR (1945\u201346), chief of &lt;a href=\"Worker%20cooperative\"&gt;cooperative&lt;/a&gt; associations (1947\u201348), and chief of the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Trade%20Unions\"&gt;Association of Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt; (ZZZ) (1948\u201349). From December 1948 he was a deputy member of the (communist) &lt;a href=\"Polish%20United%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Polish United Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (PZPR) &lt;a href=\"Politburo\"&gt;Politburo&lt;/a&gt;, and a full member from 1954.\nBetween 1949 and 1950, General Ochab was deputy minister of defense and led the political branch of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20People%27s%20Army\"&gt;Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Stalinism%20in%20Poland\"&gt;Stalinist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Polish%20People%27s%20Republic\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; he was responsible for enlisting the so-called &lt;a href=\"enemies%20of%20the%20people\"&gt;enemies of the people&lt;/a&gt; to forced labour in the mines of southern Poland. These units were called \"battalions of labour\". After &lt;a href=\"Boles%C5%82aw%20Bierut\"&gt;Boles\u0142aw Bierut&lt;/a&gt;'s death, Ochab became First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party and served in that capacity between 20 March and 21 October 1956.\nDuring Ochab's rule the process of the post-Stalinist \"thaw\" was well under way, but the first secretary also played a role in authorizing the violent suppression of the &lt;a href=\"Pozna%C5%84%201956%20protests\"&gt;worker revolt in Pozna\u0144 in June&lt;/a&gt;. In October Ochab stood his ground against the Soviet leadership and is credited with helping to prevent a Soviet military intervention. He relinquished power during the VIII Plenum of the Party Central Committee, complying with the wishes of the majority of the Politburo members to promote &lt;a href=\"W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Gomu%C5%82ka\"&gt;W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka&lt;/a&gt;. Ochab remained a member of the Politburo until 1968 and also worked as minister of agriculture from 1957 to 1959, and later as the secretary of the Central Committee for agricultural affairs. Ochab was deputy chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Council%20of%20State\"&gt;Polish Council of State&lt;/a&gt; (a collective &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt; organ) in 1961\u201364. He served as &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20Poland\"&gt;chairman of the Council of State&lt;/a&gt; in 1964\u201368. In 1965\u201368 he also chaired the &lt;a href=\"Front%20of%20National%20Unity\"&gt;Front of National Unity&lt;/a&gt;.\nEdward Ochab resigned all of his party and state offices, and withdrew from politics in 1968, in protest of the &lt;a href=\"1968%20Polish%20political%20crisis\"&gt;anti-Semitic campaign&lt;/a&gt; conducted by factions within the communist party with First Secretary Gomu\u0142ka as its head. In his retirement he remained a dedicated hardline communist, but also a vocal critic of the policies pursued by the regimes of his successors.\nEarly life and career.\nEdward Ochab was born in &lt;a href=\"Krak%C3%B3w\"&gt;Krak\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt; on 16 August 1906. His father was a clerical official at the central offices of Krak\u00f3w police. In Krak\u00f3w Edward completed elementary and in 1925 secondary (the Trade Academy) education. In 1926\u201327 he attended and graduated from a higher course in &lt;a href=\"Worker%20cooperative\"&gt;cooperative science&lt;/a&gt; at the Agricultural Department of the &lt;a href=\"Jagiellonian%20University\"&gt;Jagiellonian University&lt;/a&gt;. From September 1925, he was employed in a cooperative rural association in &lt;a href=\"Wieliczka\"&gt;Wieliczka&lt;/a&gt;. In 1928 became manager in a cooperative enterprise in &lt;a href=\"Radom\"&gt;Radom&lt;/a&gt;.\nOchab was &lt;a href=\"Conscription\"&gt;drafted&lt;/a&gt; and in June 1928 sent to a military school, but was judged there to be of a subversive attitude, apparently a &lt;a href=\"Communism%20in%20Poland\"&gt;declared communist&lt;/a&gt;, permanently employed in worker cooperatives. The school released him in October. Ochab returned to manage his Radom cooperative until February 1930.\nActivist in the Communist Party of Poland.\nOchab became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Communist Party of Poland&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 1929. In the next ten years he was arrested five times and spent six and a half years as a &lt;a href=\"political%20prisoner\"&gt;political prisoner&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sanation\"&gt;Sanation&lt;/a&gt; prisons, intermittently released for health reasons (suffered from &lt;a href=\"tuberculosis\"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;). When not in prison, he worked in the party executive in Radom, Krak\u00f3w, &lt;a href=\"Katowice\"&gt;Katowice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA\"&gt;\u0141\u00f3d\u017a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Toru%C5%84\"&gt;Toru\u0144&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gdynia\"&gt;Gdynia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"W%C5%82oc%C5%82awek\"&gt;W\u0142oc\u0142awek&lt;/a&gt;, frequently relocating or in hiding. Ochab was among the organizers of the miner strikes in &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20Krakowskie\"&gt;Zag\u0142\u0119bie Krakowskie&lt;/a&gt; (1932), in &lt;a href=\"Zag%C5%82%C4%99bie%20D%C4%85browskie\"&gt;Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie&lt;/a&gt; (1935) and the textile worker general strike in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (1936).\nOchab married a fellow communist activist, Rachela Silbiger, a nurse from a \"poor and simple\" &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; family. They had four daughters, born in the 1930s and 1940s.\nOn 7 September 1939, the German forces were approaching Warsaw and the guards in the Warsaw prison where Ochab was held fled. Released by fellow inmates he traveled toward &lt;a href=\"Garwolin\"&gt;Garwolin&lt;/a&gt;, but having found out about Warsaw's defense preparations returned to the capital to participate. On 11 September Ochab joined a workers' defense regiment and fought in the poorly armed unit until the city's capitulation.\nTo continue his party work and to protect his wife Ochab then decided to move into the territories controlled by the Soviet Union. He had met \"thousands of comrades\" (although many perished in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Purge\"&gt;Stalin's purges&lt;/a&gt;), was thoroughly familiar with the situation on the Polish Left and was ready to get engaged in the rebuilding of the Polish revolutionary movement. With others who shared their point of view, the Ochabs on 2 October embarked on a trip to &lt;a href=\"Siedlce\"&gt;Siedlce&lt;/a&gt;, and from there went to &lt;a href=\"Lviv\"&gt;Lw\u00f3w&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Soviet Union.\nOchab lived and worked in &lt;a href=\"Lviv\"&gt;Lviv&lt;/a&gt; until June 1941. He organized there a small circle of Polish communist sympathizers, but in June approached the Soviet authorities declaring readiness to return to &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt;-occupied Poland for conspiratorial work. However, &lt;a href=\"Operation%20Barbarossa\"&gt;Germany attacked the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, Ochab volunteered for the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt; and was assigned to an auxiliary unit. In winter his health problems reappeared and caused him to return to civilian work in the Polish section of a Soviet foreign language publishing institute. In May 1943 the enterprise was moved to &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;. Ochab became active in the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20Polish%20Patriots\"&gt;Union of Polish Patriots&lt;/a&gt; there, leading its administrative-economic department.\nAs the pro-Soviet and communist controlled Polish armed forces were being formed in the Soviet Union, in June 1943 Ochab joined the &lt;a href=\"Polish%201st%20Tadeusz%20Ko%C5%9Bciuszko%20Infantry%20Division\"&gt;1st Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko Infantry Division&lt;/a&gt; and was enlisted as a political officer with the rank of second lieutenant. In October 1943 he fought valiantly in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Lenino\"&gt;Battle of Lenino&lt;/a&gt;, for which he was decorated with both the Polish and Soviet medals for valor. In the summer of 1944 Lieutenant Colonel Ochab was already a member of the Central Committee of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Polish Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt;.\nParty and state official 1944\u201356.\nIn July 1944 in &lt;a href=\"Lublin\"&gt;Lublin&lt;/a&gt; Ochab became an official plenipotentiary of the command of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Polish%20Army%20%281944%E2%80%9345%29\"&gt;First Polish Army&lt;/a&gt;. In September he was promoted to the post of the Army's deputy commander for political affairs. He claimed having participated in the military struggle for Warsaw and in the drive to push across the &lt;a href=\"Vistula\"&gt;Vistula&lt;/a&gt; at that time. In November Ochab was discharged from the army and directed to work for the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Committee%20of%20National%20Liberation\"&gt;Polish Committee of National Liberation&lt;/a&gt;, the nascent communist government, where he became deputy chief of the Public Administration Department. From the beginning of 1945 the PKWN was turned into the &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20Government%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Provisional Government&lt;/a&gt; and Ochab was an undersecretary in the Ministry of Public Administration, advancing in April to the post of minister. As the plenipotentiary general for the &lt;a href=\"Recovered%20Territories\"&gt;Recovered Territories&lt;/a&gt; (previously German lands assumed by Poland), on 25 June 1945 Ochab issued a directive banning and threatening penalties for persecution of Germans still present there or applying repressions like the ones used by the &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; against Poles. He left the government at the end of June, when it became the &lt;a href=\"Provisional%20Government%20of%20National%20Unity\"&gt;Provisional Government of National Unity&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards Ochab was a member of the Secretariat and held the position of propaganda chief of the PPR (1945\u201346) and of first secretary of the regional PPR branch in &lt;a href=\"Katowice\"&gt;Katowice&lt;/a&gt; (1946\u201348). He returned to his cooperative and worker activities, as chief of worker cooperative associations in 1947\u201348, and chief of the Central Council of Trade Unions in 1948\u201349. In December 1948, the PPR and the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Polish Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; became the single &lt;a href=\"Polish%20United%20Workers%27%20Party\"&gt;Polish United Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; (PZPR), which was to rule Poland until 1989. In the new party Ochab became a deputy member of the Politburo (1948\u201354).\nIn one more turn of Ochab's military career, on 1 April 1949 President &lt;a href=\"Boles%C5%82aw%20Bierut\"&gt;Boles\u0142aw Bierut&lt;/a&gt; named him a general and first deputy minister of defense. Minister &lt;a href=\"Micha%C5%82%20Rola-%C5%BBymierski\"&gt;Micha\u0142 Rola-\u017bymierski&lt;/a&gt; was replaced in November 1949 by &lt;a href=\"Konstantin%20Rokossovsky\"&gt;Konstantin Rokossovsky&lt;/a&gt;, a Soviet marshal of Polish origin. From January 1950, at the time of increasing &lt;a href=\"Sovietization\"&gt;Sovietization&lt;/a&gt; of the Polish military, Ochab led the political division of the armed forces. In June Rokossovsky discharged him from active military service and from his assignments at the Ministry of Defense.\nIn 1950\u201352 Ochab chaired the &lt;a href=\"Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20Friendship%20Society\"&gt;Polish\u2013Soviet Friendship Society&lt;/a&gt;. He was secretary of the Central Committee from 1950, responsible for the area of ideology. From 1952 he also led the Central Committee's supervision of the military's political division.\nAt that time and later in his career Ochab had a tendency to express his views in radical and uncompromising terms. When Cardinal &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Wyszy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt; was arrested on 25 September 1953, Ochab published an article fiercely critical of the &lt;a href=\"Primate%20%28bishop%29\"&gt;primate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Trybuna%20Ludu\"&gt;Trybuna Ludu&lt;/a&gt;, the party's official newspaper. In regard to the persecution and imprisonment of &lt;a href=\"W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Gomu%C5%82ka\"&gt;W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka&lt;/a&gt;, Ochab later blamed &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Stalin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lavrenti%20Beria\"&gt;Beria&lt;/a&gt;, rather than Bierut or &lt;a href=\"Jakub%20Berman\"&gt;Jakub Berman&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the PZPR's Second Congress in March 1954, Ochab finally became a full Politburo member. By many in the party he was considered an \"&lt;a href=\"heir%20apparent\"&gt;heir apparent&lt;/a&gt;\" and was ready to take over when First Secretary Bierut died in Moscow in March 1956.\nFirst secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party.\nFirst Secretary &lt;a href=\"Nikita%20Khrushchev\"&gt;Nikita Khrushchev&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Communist Party of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; attended Bierut's funeral and stayed in Warsaw to participate in the deliberations of the PZPR Central Committee's 6th Plenum, charged with electing a new first secretary. &lt;a href=\"Aleksander%20Zawadzki\"&gt;Aleksander Zawadzki&lt;/a&gt; was the other major candidate, but in the end Edward Ochab was chosen unanimously on 20 March. Ochab was seen as a compromise candidate by the rival \"Pu\u0142awy\" and \"Natolin\" factions of the party. Soon he was perceived as connected with the more liberal \"Pu\u0142awy\" group.\nIn June 1956 Ochab attended a &lt;a href=\"Comecon\"&gt;Comecon&lt;/a&gt; gathering of leaders in Moscow. He displayed there his confrontational style when responding to accusations of the supposedly inadequate supplies of coal from Poland. But the encounter also made him doubt his long term suitability as a first secretary.\nAfter the PZPR's 6th Plenum and Ochab's election the processes of &lt;a href=\"de-Stalinization\"&gt;de-Stalinization&lt;/a&gt; in Poland entered their accelerated phase. The press critically discussed the previously prohibited subjects. The party was split and preoccupied with its internal affairs. The &lt;a href=\"Sejm\"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt; (national legislature), until then unable to exercise any real influence, used the opportunity and declared wide amnesty, which included in the first place the trespasses of political nature. By 20 May, a half of the 70,000 prisoners nationwide found themselves free. Numerous officials deemed responsible for the Stalinist abuses were removed from their positions, including &lt;a href=\"Jakub%20Berman\"&gt;Berman&lt;/a&gt;, who resigned as a Politburo member in early May. Segments of Polish society, including intellectuals, youth (especially academic), and even heavy industry workers were in a state of agitation and reclaiming their inherent and sovereign rights, known in &lt;a href=\"Polish%20language\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; as \"podmiotowo\u015b\u0107\".\nWhat was happening under Ochab's watch turned out not to be a semi-controlled evolution of the system, because on 28 June workers in &lt;a href=\"Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Pozna\u0144&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"H.%20Cegielski%20%E2%80%93%20Pozna%C5%84\"&gt;Cegielski&lt;/a&gt; industrial enterprise, frustrated with their inability to redress grievances through official channels, &lt;a href=\"Pozna%C5%84%201956%20protests\"&gt;went on strike and rioted&lt;/a&gt;. Other workers and Pozna\u0144 residents joined and violence ensued. Ochab gave Minister of Defense Rokossovsky permission to bring military units to the city and use the force necessary to bring the \"counterrevolutionary\" revolt under control. Several dozens of mostly civilians were killed and massive damage sustained during the two days of fighting.\nCentral Committee's 7th Plenum deliberated in the second half of July. It placed partial blame for the Pozna\u0144 protests on bureaucratic and economic errors. Liberalization and democratization were discussed and the decision was made to readmit to the party the previously expelled &lt;a href=\"W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Gomu%C5%82ka\"&gt;Gomu\u0142ka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marian%20Spychalski\"&gt;Spychalski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zenon%20Kliszko\"&gt;Kliszko&lt;/a&gt;. Gomu\u0142ka's \"right-wing nationalist deviation\" charge was upheld, but both the \"Pu\u0142awy\" and \"Natolin\" factions were promoting the idea of his return to power. Ochab, who in 1948 strongly attacked Gomu\u0142ka, was now overcoming his personal objections and evolving toward entrusting the former PPR chief a high office. On 31 July, delegated by the Politburo, Ochab and Zawadzki had their initial meeting with Gomu\u0142ka that lasted several hours. Subsequently, the &lt;a href=\"Polskie%20Radio\"&gt;Polish Radio&lt;/a&gt; broadcast the information of Gomu\u0142ka's return to the party.\nIn September Ochab told &lt;a href=\"J%C3%B3zef%20Cyrankiewicz\"&gt;J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz&lt;/a&gt; to offer Gomu\u0142ka a position that Cyrankiewicz would be competent to offer. Cyrankiewicz offered Gomu\u0142ka his own job, that of prime minister. Gomu\u0142ka thought the move was premature and rejected the proposition. It became apparent to the PZPR establishment that Gomu\u0142ka was aiming at replacing Ochab as first secretary. Gomulka was invited to participate in Politburo conferences that took place on 12, 15 and 17 October.\nThe 8th Plenum was summoned for 19 October. The public was informed of the date and of Gomu\u0142ka's participation in the Politburo meetings by the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Press%20Agency\"&gt;Polish Press Agency&lt;/a&gt;. A statute Ochab submitted to be presented to the Plenum was criticized by &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Zambrowski\"&gt;Roman Zambrowski&lt;/a&gt; and Zawadzki. The majority of the Politburo members voted to reduce the body to nine members and the proposed list did not include Minister Rokossovsky.\nThe Soviets were increasingly worried by the plans of the leadership of the PZPR and the Soviet ambassador presented on 17 October Nikita Khrushchev's \"invitation\" for the Polish leaders to immediately visit Moscow. Ochab objected to the timing and refused to make the trip. The Soviets reacted with the announcement (18 October) of Khrushchev's and the Soviet delegation's arrival in Warsaw on 19 October, the day the 8th Plenum was set to begin its deliberations. On 18 October the Polish Politburo, unhappy with the perspective of Soviet meddling (or the appearance of such meddling) with the Plenum debate, designated Ochab, Cyrankiewicz, Zawadzki and Gomu\u0142ka to greet the Soviets at the airport.\nTheir arrival was preceded by ominous military moves. Soviet formations present in Poland were moving toward Warsaw and were stopped less than one hundred kilometers from the capital. Units in &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt; were put in a state of readiness and a number of Soviet warships approached the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Gda%C5%84sk\"&gt;Bay of Gda\u0144sk&lt;/a&gt;. Under the direction of Ochab, who \"stood firmly in defense of Poland's sovereignty\", the Polish Army and internal security forces were placed in defensive positions on the approaches to Warsaw, and the buildings where the PZPR Plenum and the meetings with the Soviet delegation were to take place were secured. It is not clear what the intentions of the formations controlled by Minister of Defense Rokossovsky and commanders loyal to him were. An even greater crisis was not far-off, because the Soviets did not inform the Polish air defenses of their coming and Polish fighter jets scrambled to confront the plane entering the Polish air space. At the military airfield Khrushchev first greeted a separate group of Soviet generals, then approached the Polish comrades, shaking his fist and shouting derogatory comments.\nThe 8th Plenum conducted some introductory business and suspended deliberations to allow the leadership to attend the separate talks with the Soviet leaders. The negotiations with the Soviets were very difficult and lasted until 1 AM. Khrushchev objected to the planned Politburo changes and the lack of \"fraternal consultations\", including the removal of Marshal Rokossovsky, noticed the increased activity of anti-Soviet elements in Poland and threatened an active military intervention. Ochab replied that the Soviet leaders themselves would not consult changes in their leadership with the Poles. He, Gomu\u0142ka, Cyrankiewicz and Zambrowski tried to reassure the Soviets that their interests were not under threat. During a break the Soviet delegation went to its embassy for internal talks and took Minister Rokossovsky with them.\nAfter their return the Soviets displayed a more friendly approach, but Khrushchev was worried that Gomu\u0142ka, the presumed next Polish communist party leader, might be a &lt;a href=\"social%20democracy\"&gt;social democrat&lt;/a&gt;. Gomu\u0142ka, replied Cyrankiewicz, combined Polish patriotism with loyalty to the Soviet Union. Ochab told Khrushchev that under the circumstances Gomu\u0142ka was the best choice to lead the country, denying the Soviets the hope of taking advantage of a split within the Polish party. The conciliatory but unyielding attitude displayed by the Polish negotiators and the widespread popular support they were obviously enjoying convinced the Soviet Presidium to cancel the military moves in progress and defer further negotiations to Gomu\u0142ka's agreed visit in Moscow in November. Early on 20 October the Soviet delegation departed, letting the 8th Plenum continue its business undisturbed.\nOchab decided not to oppose Gomu\u0142ka's rise to power, because he realized that a divided party would give the Soviets a perfect excuse to intervene. He could have easily allied himself with Marshal Rokossovsky and other discarded Politburo members, but he placed Poland's interests over his own career. In his own mind, Ochab rightfully submitted to the will of the Politburo and the Central Committee. He was no fan of Gomu\u0142ka and felt that promoting Gomu\u0142ka as the savior of Poland, unavoidably in the making, would be demeaning to the entire Polish party. But Edward Ochab did all he could to save Poland from tragic events on a mass scale, like the ones that were &lt;a href=\"Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956\"&gt;soon experienced by Hungary&lt;/a&gt;.\nWork in agriculture and as head of state.\nOchab remained a member of the new, reduced in size Politburo. He was seen as close to the factions of Zambrowski and Gomu\u0142ka in the party. In May 1957, already after the previous &lt;a href=\"Collectivization%20in%20the%20Polish%20People%27s%20Republic\"&gt;collectivization of Polish agriculture&lt;/a&gt; had been largely reversed, he became the minister of agriculture. At that time Ochab supported individual farmers and their small associations, not the large cooperatives previously favored by the state. The weaker of the state-owned &lt;a href=\"State%20Agricultural%20Farm\"&gt;State Agricultural Farm&lt;/a&gt;s (PGR) Ochab turned into cooperative units. In October 1959 Ochab gave up his ministerial position, but continued his supervisory role in the same area as a secretary of the Central Committee responsible for agricultural affairs.\nIn addition, in 1961 Ochab became deputy chairman of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Council%20of%20State\"&gt;Council of State&lt;/a&gt;, a collective &lt;a href=\"head%20of%20state\"&gt;head of state&lt;/a&gt; organ. After the Fourth Congress of the PZPR (June 1964), he retained his membership in the Politburo and the position of the Central Committee secretary. However, in August Chairman Aleksander Zawadzki died, and Ochab assumed the function of the chairman of the Council of State. He would now receive foreign leaders as the official representative of the Polish state. In March 1966, Ochab notified Primate Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski that &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Paul%20VI\"&gt;Pope Paul VI&lt;/a&gt; was being denied his request to visit Poland for the celebrations of the &lt;a href=\"Baptism%20of%20Poland%23Millennial%20celebrations%20of%201966\"&gt;Millennium of Polish Christianity&lt;/a&gt; because of the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt;'s continuing diplomatic relations with the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20government-in-exile\"&gt;Polish government-in-exile&lt;/a&gt;.\nMarch 1968.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1968%20Polish%20political%20crisis\"&gt;events in Poland&lt;/a&gt; usually described under the March 1968 heading actually began after the &lt;a href=\"Six-Day%20War\"&gt;Six-Day War&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arabs\"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; countries in June 1967. On 19 June First Secretary Gomu\u0142ka spoke in Warsaw to a labor union congress and implicitly referred to the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Poland\"&gt;Polish Jewish population&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"fifth%20column\"&gt;fifth column&lt;/a&gt;. Ochab insisted that the term should be deleted from the published transcript of the speech, and it was.\nThe widely publicized student demonstrations in Warsaw took place on 8 March 1968. On 19 March, Gomu\u0142ka delivered another major televised speech. Reviewing with other Politburo members its text in advance, Ochab objected to Gomu\u0142ka's reference to \"student youth of Jewish origin\". The Jewish youth were justifiably sensitive because of the millions of Jews killed in Poland during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, he argued.\nOchab's and Gomu\u0142ka's wives were Jewish, but unlike Gomu\u0142ka, Ochab displayed no tolerance for the antisemitic excesses. To protest the policies pursued in 1967\u201368 in Poland he decided to resign all of his state and party offices, effectively retiring from political life. He wrote appropriate letters to the Politburo and the Sejm and had a final conversation with Gomu\u0142ka, Cyrankiewicz and Kliszko. He wrote of the \"antisemitic campaign organized by the various reactionary elements, yesterday's &lt;a href=\"National%20Radical%20Camp%20Falanga\"&gt;phalangists&lt;/a&gt; and their today's highly placed protectors\" (&lt;a href=\"Mieczys%C5%82aw%20Moczar\"&gt;Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar&lt;/a&gt;'s faction in the party). The Politburo accepted his resignation on 8 April and three days later the Sejm replaced Ochab with &lt;a href=\"Marian%20Spychalski\"&gt;Marian Spychalski&lt;/a&gt; as chairman of the Council of State. General &lt;a href=\"Wojciech%20Jaruzelski\"&gt;Wojciech Jaruzelski&lt;/a&gt;, the armed forces chief of staff, replaced Spychalski as the minister of defense.\nIn retirement.\nOchab first proceeded to safeguard the documents that secured his historical role, the forty years he had been active in the communist movement. He witnessed &lt;a href=\"Polish%201970%20protests\"&gt;Gomu\u0142ka's fall from power&lt;/a&gt; in 1970 and the generational change in the PZPR and later expressed highly critical opinions regarding the use of force against the protesting workers, even though he himself had made comparable decisions in 1956.\nHe carefully observed the dealings of the new leadership of &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Gierek\"&gt;Edward Gierek&lt;/a&gt;. When the Party \"Guidelines\" were published before its Sixth Congress and the rank and file was asked to debate them, Ochab took advantage of the opportunity and typed up on 30 September 1971 several pages of \"Introductory Critical Comments\". The letter, which included reformist, &lt;a href=\"Revisionism%20%28Marxism%29\"&gt;revisionist&lt;/a&gt; or social democratic ideas, caused an uproar because it was soon published by the Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 &lt;a href=\"Kultura\"&gt;Kultura&lt;/a&gt; journal in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; under the title \"Edward Ochab in the Opposition\".\nThe former first secretary criticized the advancing for managerial party and state jobs of cynical career-oriented people, serving only the autocrat (Gomu\u0142ka) and his circle. He called for measures preventing such \"deformations\" now and in the future. He proposed a radical reduction in the scope and budget of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and a removal from positions of responsibility of \"non-reformable bureaucrats, career-minded people, hooded &lt;a href=\"National%20Radical%20Camp%20Falanga\"&gt;ONR&lt;/a&gt; followers, anti-semites, nationalists and morally deprived people\". The \"completely inert\" Sejm should be competitively elected from separate lists of the participating parties and activists not affiliated with any party (members in the &lt;a href=\"Front%20of%20National%20Unity\"&gt;Front of National Unity&lt;/a&gt;), which would be applauded by the electorate and \"our brothers, the Western communists\". The peculiarities of Ochab's proposed solutions included advocating the original \"&lt;a href=\"Leninism\"&gt;Leninist&lt;/a&gt;\" ways, such as an establishment of &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20council\"&gt;Worker Delegate Councils&lt;/a&gt; in enterprises, and his belief that old comrades from the prewar &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Communist Party of Poland&lt;/a&gt; ought to be returned to power. Stripped of its Leninist phraseology, the idea of powerful Worker Councils could be interpreted as a call for a massive labor union movement (delegates elected in all institutions employing one hundred or more people would collectively constitute a second chamber of parliament), something attempted several years later by &lt;a href=\"Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29\"&gt;Solidarity&lt;/a&gt;. Such postulates (or their dissemination abroad) could not have been well received by the PZPR's new leadership and Ochab and his views were severely rebuked. During a dispute in his local party organization, Ochab warned that the current investment policy was still wrong, \"the economy will collapse, which will create a new &lt;a href=\"Polish%201970%20protests\"&gt;December&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFrom 13 November 1971 to 19 January 1972 Ochab and his wife took a Western Europe coast and &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt; cruise on board a Polish merchant ship. During the journey they were closely followed by the Polish secret services, but the government picked up its entire cost.\nIn October 1977, Ochab was one of the signatories of the letter addressed to First Secretary Gierek and the Politburo. It was signed by a group of intellectuals and former party activists and was highly critical of Gierek team's political and economic record. The letter referred to the &lt;a href=\"June%201976%20protests\"&gt;protests of the previous year&lt;/a&gt; and called for fundamental political and democratizing reforms. Repressions and restrictions would only aggravate the crisis, the authors wrote, and open societal dialog was necessary. Free elections to the Sejm and &lt;a href=\"National%20Council%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;local councils&lt;/a&gt; and especially close partnership with labor unions were urged as prerequisites to any real improvement in the country's precarious internal situation.\nIn November 1979, as the PZPR's Eighth Congress was approaching, Ochab wrote a ten-page letter \"To Comrades Communists\", which &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20Eisler\"&gt;Jerzy Eisler&lt;/a&gt; characterizes as highly ideological, detached from practical usefulness. Most of the current party leadership, wrote Ochab referring to the events of prewar Poland, \"had not participated in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"fascism\"&gt;fascist&lt;/a&gt; organs of the Polish &lt;a href=\"bourgeoisie\"&gt;bourgeoisie&lt;/a&gt; power\", too many \"did not appreciate the historic importance of the communists' fight against the shameful rule of the reactionary Polish bourgeoisie\". Later in the letter Ochab engaged in polemics with the recent works of Polish historians, which he interpreted as a creeping rehabilitation and legitimization of the &lt;a href=\"Sanation\"&gt;Sanation&lt;/a&gt; regime. \"Such works clearly lead to a whitewashing of the reactionary rule of our capitalists and big landowners, to the slighting of the historic role of the communists in the fight against fascism and the hostile to the masses terrorist policies of the &lt;a href=\"Pi%C5%82sudskiite\"&gt;Pi\u0142sudskiite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"National%20Democracy%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;National Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, ONR. The venerable professors negate the fascist character of the &lt;a href=\"May%20Coup%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;post-May&lt;/a&gt; governments\". The former first secretary, who had spent a considerable part of his younger years in Sanation prisons, wrote also of the responsibility for the \"spilled blood of thousands of workers and peasants murdered during the strikes and occupations, in antisemitic and anti-Ukrainian &lt;a href=\"pogrom\"&gt;pogrom&lt;/a&gt;s, prison and &lt;a href=\"Bereza%20Kartuska%20prison\"&gt;Bereza Kartuzka&lt;/a&gt; persecutions\" resting with the \"dull military regime, blinded by the hatred for the Soviet Union, the subjugated nations and the Polish masses\". Finally Ochab denounced the current \"anti-socialist groups\", which slandered the people's democracy and &lt;a href=\"Marxism\"&gt;Marxism&lt;/a&gt;; \"they dream of anti-socialist activation of the Polish &lt;a href=\"ayatollah\"&gt;ayatollah&lt;/a&gt;s\" (&lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; hierarchy). Ochab felt uneasy about both the emerging great independent worker movement, the future Solidarity, and his own \"communist\" party that he had found so much fault with.\nEdward Ochab died on 1 May 1989, between the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Round%20Table%20Agreement\"&gt;Round Table&lt;/a&gt; groundbreaking negotiations and the historic &lt;a href=\"1989%20Polish%20legislative%20election\"&gt;elections of 4 June&lt;/a&gt;, which marked the beginning of the systemic change in Poland. At Ochab's funeral on 8 May at the &lt;a href=\"Pow%C4%85zki%20Military%20Cemetery\"&gt;Pow\u0105zki Military Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20J%C4%99drychowski\"&gt;Stefan J\u0119drychowski&lt;/a&gt; stressed his role in the dissemination of &lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Cult%20of%20Personality%20and%20Its%20Consequences\"&gt;Khrushchev's secret report&lt;/a&gt; among the PZPR members in March 1956. Ochab was deeply disappointed by the &lt;a href=\"Sino-Soviet%20split\"&gt;Sino-Soviet split&lt;/a&gt;, J\u0119drychowski said, and welcomed &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Gorbachev\"&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/a&gt;'s reforms as long-awaited and giving reasons for hope."
