The rivalry between the two teams began to heat up since the 2000s. with the hostility of supporters, and has spread both sides as a prestigious match in Indonesian Football.\nOrigin.\nBefore Indonesia's independence, in 1930 a football association in Indonesia called the \"Inlandsche Stedenwedstrden\" was held, the football clubs Persib Bandung and Persija Jakarta met several times, but the matches were normal. After Indonesia's independence, clubs in Indonesia began to form again and a football association in Indonesia was again organized called the \"Perserikatan\" in 1950 to 1995. At that time meetings between the two clubs were also rare, Persib Bandung had several hot matches but with &lt;a href=\"PSMS%20Medan\"&gt;PSMS Medan&lt;/a&gt;, the competition they can be called a classic derby, Persib Bandung several times stepped into the final which was held at the &lt;a href=\"Gelora%20Bung%20Karno%20Stadium\"&gt;Gelora Bung Karno Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and their supporters always filled the stands, Persija Jakarta at that time did not have many fans, until in the late 1990s Persija Jakarta fans were formed, in the 2000s clashes between supporters often occurred and caused problems, here the competition spread to teams and clubs until now many events occur.\nResults.\nOfficial match results.\nSource: \nData Incomplete\nHead-to-head results overall.\nUpdate 21 November 2021&lt;br&gt;Data Incomplete\nRecords.\n\"Data from &lt;a href=\"2007-08%20Liga%20Indonesia%20Premier%20Division\"&gt;2007-08 Liga Indonesia Premier Division&lt;/a&gt;\"&lt;br&gt;As 10 July 2019\nMen in both teams.\nNote: \nHead coaches who coached for both clubs.\nsource:\nSupporters.\nTheir supporters have never met after the start of hostilities between supporters of Persija and Persib in the 2000s, to date. Many conflicts occur including the death of one of the supporters and clashes which resulted in injury.\nPersija Jakarta.\nPersija Jakarta's supporters called \"The Jakmania\". Founded in 1997 by Gugun Gondrong and Ferry Indrasjarief with orange colour as their identity. The Jakmania is one of the biggest football club supporters in Indonesia.\nPersib Bandung.\nPersib Bandung fans often refer to themselves as \"Bobotoh\", this name comes from the Sundanese language. Literally as people provide support, spirit and encouragement, for those who do the match. There are several groups of Persib Bandung supporters but the most famous and the beginning of hostility with Persija Jakarta supporters is the Viking Persib Club (VPC).\nTragedy.\nTwo biggest tragedy occurred on March 5 2012, when Rangga Cipta Nugraha was beaten to the ground with a stadium bench only because he cheered happily when the Persib player scored, some say that the blood on his head did not stop pouring even until he was put into a grave.\nAnother tragedy happened on September 23, 2018, when before the match begins, one of the Jakmania members, Haringga Sirla, was killed by some unscrupulous host fans. Condolences for Haringga also flowed from the netizens throughout social media. In response to the incident, the &lt;a href=\"Football%20Association%20of%20Indonesia\"&gt;Football Association of Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; forced Persib Bandung to pay a IDR 100 million (US$6,634) fine and play the remainder the team's home matches of the 2018 season behind closed doors.\nReconciliation.\nUntil now, many parties want these two supporters to unite, but there are still many who provoke either from The Jakmania or Bobotoh, whether on social media or in real life. The dark past makes these two supporters difficult to unite, even to the point that there is a slogan, \"Biarkan Permusuhan Ini Tetap Abadi\", which means, \"Let This Feud Remain Eternal\" from one of the main figure Bobotoh frontman."
