    "text": "The Atomiswave is a custom &lt;a href=\"arcade%20system%20board\"&gt;arcade system board&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arcade%20cabinet\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sammy%20Corporation\"&gt;Sammy Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. It is based on Sega's &lt;a href=\"Sega%20Dreamcast\"&gt;Dreamcast&lt;/a&gt; console, sharing similarities with the &lt;a href=\"Sega%20NAOMI\"&gt;NAOMI&lt;/a&gt;, \nas far as it uses interchangeable &lt;a href=\"game%20cartridge\"&gt;game cartridge&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as a removable module for changing the control scheme (including dual &lt;a href=\"joystick\"&gt;joystick&lt;/a&gt;s, dual &lt;a href=\"light%20gun\"&gt;light gun&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"steering%20wheel\"&gt;steering wheel&lt;/a&gt;), but unlike the NAOMI, the Atomiswave doesn't feature expanded RAM compared to the Dreamcast.\nWith the retirement of the aging &lt;a href=\"Neo%20Geo%20%28console%29\"&gt;Neo Geo MVS&lt;/a&gt; system, &lt;a href=\"SNK%20Playmore\"&gt;SNK Playmore&lt;/a&gt; chose the Atomiswave as its next system to develop games for. In a contract with &lt;a href=\"Sammy%20Corporation\"&gt;Sammy&lt;/a&gt;, SNK Playmore agreed to develop five games for the Atomiswave system. \"&lt;a href=\"Metal%20Slug%206\"&gt;Metal Slug 6&lt;/a&gt;\" was SNK Playmore's fifth game for the Atomiswave, after which SNK moved on to a &lt;a href=\"Taito%20Type%20X\"&gt;Taito Type X&lt;/a&gt;2 arcade board.\nAW-net.\nIn Japan, the Atomiswave was able to connect via a special modem to the AW-Net online system set up by Sammy. The AW-Net was primarily used to play online with other players and to create online player rankings. AW-Net was discontinued on 30 November 2006 following the merger of Sammy and Sega; the follow-up system was &lt;a href=\"ALL.Net\"&gt;ALL.Net&lt;/a&gt;."
