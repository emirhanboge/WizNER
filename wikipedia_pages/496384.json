    "text": "Johannes Hermann Zukertort (Polish: \"Jan Hermann Cukiertort\"; 7 September 1842 \u2013 20 June 1888) was a Polish-German-British &lt;a href=\"chess%20master\"&gt;chess master&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the leading world players for most of the 1870s and 1880s, but lost to &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Steinitz\"&gt;Wilhelm Steinitz&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"World%20Chess%20Championship%201886\"&gt;World Chess Championship 1886&lt;/a&gt;, which is generally regarded as the first &lt;a href=\"World%20Chess%20Championship\"&gt;World Chess Championship&lt;/a&gt; match. He was also defeated by Steinitz in 1872 in an unofficial championship.\nZukertort filled his relatively short life with a wide range of other achievements as a soldier, musician, linguist, journalist and political activist.\nEarly life and non-chess achievements.\nZukertort was born on 7\u00a0September 1842 in &lt;a href=\"Lublin\"&gt;Lublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Congress%20Poland\"&gt;Congress Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Empire\"&gt;Russian Empire&lt;/a&gt; as Jan Hermann Cukiertort. He said that his mother was the Baroness Krzy\u017canowska (Krzyzanovska). His father was a &lt;a href=\"Christian%20mission\"&gt;Protestant Christian missionary&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Poland\"&gt;Polish-Jewish descent&lt;/a&gt;. Because the Christian Protestant mission among the Jewish population in Russian-occupied Poland was considered illegal and heretical, the Zukertort family emigrated to &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;. He was educated at the gymnasium of &lt;a href=\"Breslau\"&gt;Breslau&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1866 at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Breslau\"&gt;University of Breslau&lt;/a&gt;, from which he graduated in medicine in 1866. As a member of the medical corps of the Prussian army he saw service in 1866 during the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Prussian%20war\"&gt;Austro-Prussian war&lt;/a&gt;, and again during the &lt;a href=\"Franco-Prussian%20war\"&gt;Franco-Prussian war&lt;/a&gt; of 1870\u20131871.\nZukertort is widely suspected to have embellished his biography. In an account of his life for the \"Eastern Daily Press\" in 1872 many claims were made on his behalf: Aristocratic descent, fluency in nine languages (fourteen, according to other sources), and proficiency in swordsmanship, dominoes, and whist; it was also stated that he had played 6,000\u00a0games of chess with &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Anderssen\"&gt;Adolf Anderssen&lt;/a&gt;, fought in numerous battles, and was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Order of the Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;, the Iron Cross of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Army\"&gt;German Army&lt;/a&gt;, and seven other medals. He also found time to get an &lt;a href=\"M.D.\"&gt;M.D.&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Breslau\"&gt;Breslau&lt;/a&gt; in 1865, and work on the staff of the \"&lt;a href=\"Allgemeine%20Zeitung\"&gt;Allgemeine Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Otto%20von%20Bismarck\"&gt;Otto von Bismarck&lt;/a&gt;'s private organ \u2013 in addition to writing two chess books and working as the editor of a chess magazine for several years. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Oxford%20Companion%20to%20Chess\"&gt;The Oxford Companion to Chess&lt;/a&gt;\" comments, \"There is some truth in the last sentence: He was co-author of the books [and] co-editor of the chess magazine.\"\nChess career.\nStyle of play.\nUnlike the majority of attacking players, Zukertort preferred openings such as and that are &lt;a href=\"Closed%20Game\"&gt;closed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Semi-Closed%20Game\"&gt;semi-closed&lt;/a&gt; and offered the possibility of &lt;a href=\"Transposition%20%28chess%29\"&gt;transpositions&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 in fact in the early 1880s 1.\u00a0Nf3 was known as \"&lt;a href=\"Zukertort%20Opening\"&gt;Zukertort's Opening&lt;/a&gt;\", 40\u00a0years before it became known as the &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9ti%20Opening\"&gt;R\u00e9ti Opening&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his prime Zukertort also excelled at &lt;a href=\"blindfold%20chess\"&gt;blindfold chess&lt;/a&gt;. In 1876, he played sixteen games simultaneously while blindfolded, winning eleven, drawing four, and losing only one.\nLearning chess.\nZukertort learned to play chess in &lt;a href=\"Breslau\"&gt;Breslau&lt;/a&gt; when he was about age 19. Entering a tournament in that city, and receiving the &lt;a href=\"Odds%20%28chess%29\"&gt;odds&lt;/a&gt; of the queen, he lost every game, whereupon he took up the study of Bilguer's \"Handbuch\", with the result that in 1862 he won games from the leading German chess player &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Anderssen\"&gt;Adolf Anderssen&lt;/a&gt; at the odds of a knight. Zukertort studied with Anderssen and within a very few years he became one of the strongest players in Germany.\nAmong many other notable matches that Zukertort played with Anderssen, he defeated him in 1866, lost in 1868 by a score of eight wins, three losses, one &lt;a href=\"draw%20%28chess%29\"&gt;draw&lt;/a&gt;, and finally defeated him convincingly (5\u20132; no draws) in a match in 1871. In 1867 he moved to &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; and in 1872 to London. In that year, he played &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20Steinitz\"&gt;Wilhelm Steinitz&lt;/a&gt; in London, losing\u00a09\u20133 (7\u00a0losses, 1\u00a0win, 4\u00a0draws).\nLate 1870s\u2013early 1880s.\nAlthough Zukertort lost both his matches against Steinitz, he proved that he was superior to other opponents throughout the late 1870s and early 1880s. During this period top-class tournaments were rare and Zukertort's best performances were mostly in matches, notably against Anderssen in 1871 and &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Henry%20Blackburne\"&gt;Joseph Henry Blackburne&lt;/a&gt; in 1881 (6\u00a0wins, 2\u00a0losses, 5\u00a0draws). Nonetheless Zukertort was one of the most successful tournament players of his time: third place behind Steinitz and Blackburne at London, 1872; first place at &lt;a href=\"Cologne\"&gt;Cologne&lt;/a&gt;, and second at &lt;a href=\"Leipzig\"&gt;Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; in 1877; tied for first with &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Winawer\"&gt;Simon Winawer&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Paris%201878%20chess%20tournament\"&gt;Paris 1878 chess tournament&lt;/a&gt; and beat Winawer in the playoff; second at &lt;a href=\"Berlin\"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; in 1881, behind Blackburne; tied for fourth at &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; in 1882; first at London in 1883, 3\u00a0points ahead of Steinitz. The 1878 win in Paris led to some suggestion that Zukertort was the world's leading player, although Steinitz did not compete.\nZukertort's win in the &lt;a href=\"London%201883%20chess%20tournament\"&gt;London 1883 chess tournament&lt;/a&gt; was his most significant success: He won his games against most of the world's leading players, scoring 22/26, and he finished 3\u00a0points ahead of Steinitz, who was second with 19/26. This tournament established that Steinitz and Zukertort were clearly the best two players in the world, and led to the &lt;a href=\"World%20Chess%20Championship\"&gt;World Chess Championship&lt;/a&gt; match between these two.\nThe &lt;a href=\"World%20Chess%20Championship%201886\"&gt;1886 World Chess Championship match&lt;/a&gt; lasted from 11\u00a0January to 29\u00a0March 1886. After building up a 4\u20131\u00a0lead Zukertort wilted, lost four of the last five games, and lost the match by 12\u00bd\u20137\u00bd.\nDecline and death.\nAfter his 1886 defeat, Zukertort's health suffered and he was a greatly weakened player for the remaining two years of his life. Diagnoses of his ailments include &lt;a href=\"rheumatism\"&gt;rheumatism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coronary%20heart%20disease\"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kidney\"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt; problems, and &lt;a href=\"arteriosclerosis\"&gt;arteriosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;. His results after the 1886 match declined steeply: Seventh at London, and third at &lt;a href=\"Nottingham\"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt; in 1886; fifteenth at Frankfurt, and fourth at London in 1887; lost a match in 1887 against Blackburne (1\u00a0win, 5\u00a0losses, and 8\u00a0draws); and seventh at London in 1888.\nPoor health and lack of physical stamina appeared to be one of Zukertort's two long-term weaknesses: Some commentators attributed to illness the severity of his defeat in the 1872 match against Steinitz; aside from the tournaments mentioned above, in the 1883 London tournament he won 22\u00a0of his first 23\u00a0games \u2013 enough to give him an uncatchable lead \u2013 but lost his last 3\u00a0games.\nHis other weakness was that, while no one had greater attacking flair, Zukertort never approached Steinitz' understanding of positional play, and Steinitz often outmaneuvered him fairly simply.\nZukertort died on 20\u00a0June 1888, in London, from a &lt;a href=\"Intracerebral%20hemorrhage\"&gt;cerebral haemorrhage&lt;/a&gt; after playing a game in a tournament at &lt;a href=\"Simpson%27s-in-the-Strand\"&gt;Simpson's Divan&lt;/a&gt;, which he was leading at the time. He is buried in &lt;a href=\"Brompton%20Cemetery\"&gt;Brompton Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, London.\nTrivia.\nIt is said that Steinitz and Zukertort, present at the same dinner party, both rose in response to a toast to the \"greatest chess-player in the world\". Research by &lt;a href=\"Edward%20G.%20Winter\"&gt;Edward G. Winter&lt;/a&gt; suggests that this story has been embellished."
