It was declared a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Norway\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"municipal%20council%20%28Norway%29\"&gt;municipal council&lt;/a&gt; in B\u00e6rum on 4 June 2003.\nSandvika is situated approximately west of &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;. It is the main transportation hub for Western B\u00e6rum, and has a combined bus and &lt;a href=\"Sandvika%20Station\"&gt;railway station&lt;/a&gt;. Sandvika is also one of the stops along the route of the &lt;a href=\"Flytoget\"&gt;Airport Express Train&lt;/a&gt;. Sandvika also has Scandinavia's largest super mall, &lt;a href=\"Sandvika%20Storsenter\"&gt;Sandvika Storsenter&lt;/a&gt;, with 190 stores and a total area of . On 13 March 2013, the previously pedestrianized main street was opened for car traffic and on-street parking.\nSandvika used to be home to the &lt;a href=\"BI%20Norwegian%20Business%20School\"&gt;BI Norwegian Business School&lt;/a&gt;, which moved to new surroundings in &lt;a href=\"Nydalen\"&gt;Nydalen&lt;/a&gt;, Oslo in August 2005. The building was, after some refurbishing, converted into the home of Sandvika High School.\nAnother school in Sandvika is Norges Realfagsgymnas NRG (Norwegian school of maths and science), a combined secondary school and high school. It lies in Skytterdalen and offers education in maths and science.\nThe nearby island of &lt;a href=\"Kalv%C3%B8ya%2C%20B%C3%A6rum\"&gt;Kalv\u00f8ya&lt;/a&gt; is a place for recreation. The Boat Sport House is located on Kalv\u00f8ya, and is used by &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A6rum%20KK\"&gt;B\u00e6rum KK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"B%C3%A6rum%20RK\"&gt;B\u00e6rum RK&lt;/a&gt;. It also hosted one of the best known Norwegian music festivals &lt;a href=\"Kalv%C3%B8yafestivalen\"&gt;Kalv\u00f8yafestivalen&lt;/a&gt;.\nA small islet in &lt;a href=\"Sandviksbukta\"&gt;Sandviksbukta&lt;/a&gt;, outside Sandvika, is called &lt;a href=\"Danmark%20%28islet%29\"&gt;Danmark&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Danish%20people\"&gt;Danes&lt;/a&gt; who live in the area join together every year on 5 June &lt;a href=\"Denmark\"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;'s national day to celebrate. It has been debate on the Danish flag on \"Danmark\", but currently it still is there.\nIn art and music.\n&lt;a href=\"Claude%20Monet\"&gt;Claude Monet&lt;/a&gt; visited in early 1895. During his stay he painted several views of the town and the surrounding landscape, with the mountain ridge &lt;a href=\"Kols%C3%A5s\"&gt;Kols\u00e5s&lt;/a&gt; featuring in many of the paintings either in the background or as the primary subject. Perhaps the most well known of the paintings from this visit is 'Sandviken Village in Snow' which features the L\u00f8kke bridge in the foreground with Kols\u00e5s in the background. The bridge still stands in Sandvika."
