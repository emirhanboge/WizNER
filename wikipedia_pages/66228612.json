This year's competition will be contested between only the professional clubs.\nThe competition was won by &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20RFC\"&gt;St Helens&lt;/a&gt; who beat &lt;a href=\"Castleford%20Tigers\"&gt;Castleford&lt;/a&gt; 26\u201312 at &lt;a href=\"Wembley%20Stadium\"&gt;Wembley Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on 17 July 2021.\n&lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Rhinos\"&gt;Leeds Rhinos&lt;/a&gt; were the defending champions, after defeating &lt;a href=\"Salford%20Red%20Devils\"&gt;Salford Red Devils&lt;/a&gt; 17\u201316 in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Challenge%20Cup\"&gt;2020 final&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were eliminated in round 3, after losing 18\u201324 to &lt;a href=\"St%20Helens%20RFC\"&gt;St Helens&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntrants.\nUsually the Challenge Cup is contested between the clubs of the professional &lt;a href=\"Super%20League\"&gt;Super League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RFL%20Championship\"&gt;Championship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"RFL%20League%201\"&gt;League 1&lt;/a&gt; and a number of invited amateur teams. However this year, due to the &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 Challenge Cup will not include the amateur teams. French-side &lt;a href=\"Toulouse%20Olympique\"&gt;Toulouse Olympique&lt;/a&gt; who play in the Championship choose not to play in cup competitions.\nThe matches will be broadcast by the &lt;a href=\"BBC\"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; with the initial rounds being made available online with matches from the last 16 being broadcast on television following them agreeing a new three year deal with the RFL. The date for the 2021 final was confirmed prior to the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Challenge%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2020 Challenge Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; with the hopes that fans will be able to be admitted.\nRounds.\nWhen the details of the competition were announced in December 2020, it was envisaged that the first round, would feature the League 1 clubs; and &lt;a href=\"Dewsbury%20Rams\"&gt;Dewsbury Rams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Newcastle%20Thunder\"&gt;Newcastle Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oldham%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Oldham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whitehaven%20R.L.F.C.\"&gt;Whitehaven&lt;/a&gt; from the Championship. The rest of the Championship clubs enter at round two, with the Super League clubs entering in round four.\nIt was also announced, that the early rounds of the competition will also form the early rounds of the &lt;a href=\"2021%20RFL%201895%20Cup\"&gt;1895 Cup&lt;/a&gt; with the highest four teams from the Championship and League 1, becoming the semi-finalists of the 1895 Cup, with the final to be played, on the same day as the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley.\nThe first round draw was due to be held on the week commencing 4 January 2021. However, due to the UK lockdown, this was delayed.\nA further meeting of the clubs was held on 13 January 2021, to discuss alternative schedules for both the cup competitions and the league fixtures, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \nSeveral contingency plans were announced, which mostly affected the involvement of the League 1 clubs in the Challenge Cup.\nAfter further discussion around option 3, the majority of the League 1 clubs decided not to participate in the competition. &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Raiders\"&gt;Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keighley%20Cougars\"&gt;Keighley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"West%20Wales%20Raiders\"&gt;West Wales Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, decided to enter, and played in a 16-team round 1 with the 13 participating Championship clubs.\nRound 1 was scheduled for the weekend of 20\u201321 March.\nAfter the announcement, at least two League 1 clubs, Rochdale and Hunslet, expressed disappointment and claimed that a selection process had taken place rather than all clubs withdrawing.\nAny club unable to fulfil a tie in the first two rounds will forfeit the fixture to their opponents. Ties unable to be played due to a team having seven or more players out due to COVID-19 restrictions, will be re-arranged and will take precedence over league fixtures.\nFirst round.\nThe draw for the first and second rounds of the competition was made on 11 February 2021.

A new to rugby league broadcaster, The Sportsman's digital services, showed games from all the first three rounds on its website or social media channels. The games that were not picked up by the BBC or The Sportsman's digital services were broadcast by the RFL itself on a &lt;a href=\"pay-per-view\"&gt;pay-per-view&lt;/a&gt; basis via the \"Our League\" app. For the quarter-finals, &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Sports\"&gt;Sky Sports&lt;/a&gt; broadcast two of the four matches with the BBC showing the other two. With the semi-final and the final being broadcast on BBC One and Two this was the first staging of the Challenge Cup in which every tie was broadcast live."
