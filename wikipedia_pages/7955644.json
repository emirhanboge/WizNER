    "text": "John Ross Mackay, (\u5055\u7d04\u7ff0, December 31, 1915 \u2013 October 28, 2014) was a Canadian &lt;a href=\"geographer\"&gt;geographer&lt;/a&gt;. He is most noted for his explorations of &lt;a href=\"permafrost\"&gt;permafrost&lt;/a&gt; phenomena in the western Canadian &lt;a href=\"Arctic\"&gt;Arctic&lt;/a&gt;. His 40 plus years of study has enabled the building of &lt;a href=\"Pipeline%20transport\"&gt;pipeline&lt;/a&gt; operations and &lt;a href=\"petroleum\"&gt;petroleum&lt;/a&gt; explorations in areas of frozen ground. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Society%20of%20Canada\"&gt;Royal Society of Canada&lt;/a&gt; stated the following when Mackay was awarded the &lt;a href=\"Willet%20G.%20Miller%20Medal\"&gt;Willet G. Miller Medal&lt;/a&gt; in 1975:\nEarly life.\nMackay was born in &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Formosa (Taiwan)&lt;/a&gt; (then under Japanese rule) to &lt;a href=\"George%20William%20Mackay\"&gt;George William Mackay&lt;/a&gt; and Jean Ross Mackay, as well as brother to siblings Leslie, Anna, Margaret and Isabel Minnie (1917\u20132012). His grandfather was &lt;a href=\"George%20Leslie%20Mackay\"&gt;George Leslie Mackay&lt;/a&gt;, who was instrumental in bringing Christianity and public health care to Northern Taiwan (Formosa). The &lt;a href=\"Mackay%20Memorial%20Hospital\"&gt;Mackay Memorial Hospital&lt;/a&gt; was named after his ancestor.\nMackay completed a &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;B.A.&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Clark%20University\"&gt;Clark University&lt;/a&gt; in 1939. He obtained an &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20degree\"&gt;M.A.&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Boston%20University\"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt; in 1941. That same year he left his studies to join the war effort. Mackay enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Army\"&gt;Canadian Army&lt;/a&gt;. Mackay completed training near &lt;a href=\"Toronto\"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; and further training as a private (gunner) at a large artillery camp in &lt;a href=\"Petawawa%2C%20Ontario\"&gt;Petawawa&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Ottawa%20River\"&gt;Ottawa River&lt;/a&gt;. He was commissioned an Officer (Lieutenant) by 1942. Before the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; ended he attained the rank of &lt;a href=\"major\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Canadian%20Intelligence%20Corps\"&gt;Canadian Intelligence Corps&lt;/a&gt;. He was stationed in &lt;a href=\"Ottawa\"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; until he was discharged in 1946.\nCareer.\nIn September 1946 Mackay joined &lt;a href=\"McGill%20University\"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;'s Department of &lt;a href=\"Geography\"&gt;Geography&lt;/a&gt; as an assistant professor. His first paper on \"The North Shore of the Ottawa River, Quyon to Montebello, Quebec\" was published in the &lt;a href=\"Geographie%20physique%20et%20Quaternaire\"&gt;Revue Canadienne de Geographie&lt;/a&gt;, Volume 1 in 1947. In 1949 he obtained a &lt;a href=\"Doctorate\"&gt;Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Universit%C3%A9%20de%20Montr%C3%A9al\"&gt;Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year he accepted a position at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;University of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; as an Assistant Professor with the Department of Geology and Geography. In 1953 Mackay was promoted to associate professor and became a full professor in 1957.\nMackay gained international scientific recognition through his experimental and field investigations in geography, and especially on the topic of permafrost. He published over two hundred scientific communications, adding extensive research contributions in the &lt;a href=\"Quaternary\"&gt;Quaternary&lt;/a&gt; sciences. From 1981 until his death he was an &lt;a href=\"Emeritus\"&gt;Emeritus&lt;/a&gt; Professor at the University of British Columbia, continuing to teach (voluntarily) a graduate course and undertake field research in the western Arctic, and has published over fifty papers in refereed journals.\nPersonal.\nMackay married Violet Meekins in 1944. They had two daughters, Anne and Leslie. Violet died in 1997. Mackay died in &lt;a href=\"Kelowna%2C%20British%20Columbia\"&gt;Kelowna, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 98 on October 28, 2014."
