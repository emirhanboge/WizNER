    "text": "Douglas Fowley (born Daniel Vincent Fowley, May 30, 1911 \u2013 May 21, 1998) was an American movie and television actor in more than 240\u00a0films and dozens of television programs, He is probably best remembered for his role as the frustrated movie director Roscoe Dexter in \"&lt;a href=\"Singin%27%20in%20the%20Rain\"&gt;Singin' in the Rain&lt;/a&gt;\" (1952), and for his regular supporting role as &lt;a href=\"Doc%20Holliday\"&gt;Doc Holliday&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Life%20and%20Legend%20of%20Wyatt%20Earp\"&gt;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&lt;/a&gt;\". He is the father of rock and roll musician and record producer &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Fowley\"&gt;Kim Fowley&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly years.\nFowley was born in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bronx%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;The Bronx&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. He began acting while attending St. Francis Xavier Military Academy. He later attended &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20City%20College\"&gt;Los Angeles City College&lt;/a&gt;.\nFowley began as a singing waiter and then worked as a copy boy for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\", a runner for a Wall Street broker, a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Postal%20Service\"&gt;United States Postal Service&lt;/a&gt; employee, a barker, a salesman, a professional football player, and finally a professional actor.\nMilitary service.\nFowley's enlistment in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; led to his being wounded when he served on an aircraft carrier in the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was aboard an aircraft carrier when an explosion knocked out his teeth. The dental setback hardly slowed his career as an actor. In fact, he ended up portraying one of the most well-known dentists in American history. \"I had a false upper plate, having lost my upper teeth prematurely in mid-life,\" he explained to Western Clippings in 1994. \"I started playing old character roles by removing my false upper plate, adding a beard, voice and gait to match my interpretation.\"\nFilm.\nAfter nightclub performing and stage work, Fowley appeared in 1933 in his first film, \"The Mad Game\", alongside &lt;a href=\"Spencer%20Tracy\"&gt;Spencer Tracy&lt;/a&gt;. Early in his acting career, he was usually cast as a movie heavy or gangster in B-movies, including &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Chan\"&gt;Charlie Chan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Laurel%20and%20Hardy\"&gt;Laurel and Hardy&lt;/a&gt; features.\nFowley's films include \"&lt;a href=\"Twenty%20Mule%20Team%20%281940%20film%29\"&gt;Twenty Mule Team&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Fall%20Guy%20%281947%20film%29\"&gt;Fall Guy&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Mighty%20Joe%20Young%20%281949%20film%29\"&gt;Mighty Joe Young&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Angels%20in%20the%20Outfield%20%281951%20film%29\"&gt;Angels in the Outfield&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Battleground%20%28film%29\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Armored%20Car%20Robbery\"&gt;Armored Car Robbery&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Chick%20Carter%2C%20Detective\"&gt;Chick Carter, Detective&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Naked%20Jungle\"&gt;The Naked Jungle&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20High%20and%20the%20Mighty%20%28film%29\"&gt;The High and the Mighty&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Walking%20Tall%20%281973%20film%29\"&gt;Walking Tall&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTelevision.\nRegular cast.\nFor several seasons, Fowley played the key supporting role of &lt;a href=\"Doc%20Holliday\"&gt;John H. \"Doc\" Holliday&lt;/a&gt; in the 1955-1961 &lt;a href=\"western%20%28genre%29\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; television series \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Life%20and%20Legend%20of%20Wyatt%20Earp\"&gt;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&lt;/a&gt;\" after having appeared as Doc Fabrique in the show's premiere season. This role allowed Fowley to demonstrate his flair for comedy and other acting skills as a clever, sharp-witted, sardonic, cynical, alcoholic, poker-playing foil to the square-jawed, milk-drinking, church-going Wyatt Earp (&lt;a href=\"Hugh%20O%27Brian\"&gt;Hugh O'Brian&lt;/a&gt;), whom Holiday nicknamed \"Deacon\" due to his rigid sense of morality. Not at all so encumbered Doc would occasionally take the law into his own hands behind Earp's back to protect his friend from legal action or even death when the marshal was legally or morally ham-strung. Holliday, as played by Fowley, having no problem working around morals or the law, could be either hilarious or cold-blooded.\nFrom 1966 to 1967, Fowley portrayed Andrew Hanks in \"&lt;a href=\"Pistols%20%27n%27%20Petticoats\"&gt;Pistols 'n' Petticoats&lt;/a&gt;\", a CBS sitcom. Hanks was the &lt;a href=\"patriarch\"&gt;patriarch&lt;/a&gt; in a family of gun-toting women who seemed to have little need for male assistance.\nFowley portrayed retired businessman Robert Redford in \"&lt;a href=\"Detective%20School\"&gt;Detective School&lt;/a&gt;\" (1979).\nGuest appearances.\nIn the 1950s, he appeared as himself on &lt;a href=\"National%20Broadcasting%20Company\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Donald%20O%27Connor%20Show\"&gt;The Donald O'Connor Show&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1954, he demonstrated his comic appeal when he appeared alongside &lt;a href=\"Gracie%20Allen\"&gt;Gracie Allen&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20George%20Burns%20and%20Gracie%20Allen%20Show\"&gt;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&lt;/a&gt;\".
