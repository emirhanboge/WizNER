    "text": "The Newhall Pass interchange (officially Clarence Wayne Dean Memorial Interchange) is a &lt;a href=\"highway%20interchange\"&gt;highway interchange&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Newhall%20Pass\"&gt;Newhall Pass&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Southern%20California\"&gt;Southern California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. It is south of the city of &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Clarita%2C%20California\"&gt;Santa Clarita&lt;/a&gt; and north of the &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods of &lt;a href=\"Granada%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Granada Hills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylmar%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Sylmar&lt;/a&gt;. It connects &lt;a href=\"Interstate%205%20in%20California\"&gt;Interstate\u00a05&lt;/a&gt; (I-5, Golden State Freeway) with &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20Route%2014\"&gt;California State Route\u00a014&lt;/a&gt; (SR\u00a014, Antelope Valley Freeway). It is officially named in the memory of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Los Angeles Police&lt;/a&gt; officer Clarence Wayne Dean, who was killed when the interchange collapsed during the &lt;a href=\"1994%20Northridge%20earthquake\"&gt;1994 Northridge earthquake&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 5-14 Split, as the interchange is commonly referred to as by locals, is the northernmost of five freeway interchanges on &lt;a href=\"Interstate%205\"&gt;I-5&lt;/a&gt; within a stretch. From south to north, the freeways that interchange with &lt;a href=\"Interstate%205\"&gt;I-5&lt;/a&gt; include: &lt;a href=\"Hollywood%20Freeway\"&gt;SR\u00a0170&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Valley%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Sun Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20Route%20118\"&gt;SR\u00a0118&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mission%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Mission Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20405%20%28California%29\"&gt;I-405&lt;/a&gt; also in Mission Hills, &lt;a href=\"Interstate%20210%20%28California%29\"&gt;I-210&lt;/a&gt;, in Sylmar, and ultimately the SR\u00a014.\nThe interchange is extremely large, and consists of numerous flyover ramps and two tunnels. Portions of I-5 in the pass reach up to 21 lanes wide. The complex structure combines a &lt;a href=\"Interchange%20%28road%29%23Directional%20T%20interchange%20%28Y-interchange%29\"&gt;directional T-interchange&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Local-express%20lanes\"&gt;collector\u2013distributor bypass&lt;/a&gt;. The bypass, signed as truck lanes, allows traffic to and from SR\u00a014 to avoid the congested pass summit. These truck lanes extend south to the I-210 interchange, and have direct ramps to and from the &lt;a href=\"Foothill%20Freeway\"&gt;Foothill Freeway&lt;/a&gt;. The bypass is the original four-lane freeway, built as &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Route%2099%20in%20California\"&gt;U.S. Route\u00a099&lt;/a&gt;.\nIncidents.\n1971 collapse.\nA total collapse of the southbound I-5 to northbound SR\u00a014 overpass occurred as a result of the February 9, 1971 &lt;a href=\"1971%20San%20Fernando%20earthquake\"&gt;Sylmar earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. This collapse resulted in the additional collapse of the intersecting southbound SR\u00a014 to southbound I-5 overpass (as this connector bridge was directly beneath the 5\u201314 overpass). Both bridges fell directly onto the southbound I-5 truck bypass. There was damage to all structures involved, varying from minor cracking and splaying, to the loss of complete sections of bridges.\nThe interchange was rebuilt in 1973, with additional steel rebar reinforcement.\n1994 collapse.\nThe January 17, 1994, Northridge earthquake caused the southbound SR\u00a014 to northbound I-5 connector to collapse and a bridge crossing &lt;a href=\"San%20Fernando%20Road\"&gt;San Fernando Road&lt;/a&gt; farther north along I-5 to partially fail. It also caused the southbound SR\u00a014 to southbound I-5 overpass to collapse directly onto the main I-5 freeway and the southbound I-5 truck bypass, nearly exactly as had happened in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. The collapse also closed the &lt;a href=\"Metrolink%20%28Southern%20California%29\"&gt;Metrolink&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Antelope%20Valley%20Line\"&gt;Antelope Valley Line&lt;/a&gt;, which began operation to &lt;a href=\"Lancaster%20%28Metrolink%20station%29\"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; soon after.\nThe collapse of the southbound SR\u00a014 ramp caused the death of &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department\"&gt;Los Angeles Police Department&lt;/a&gt; motorcycle officer Clarence Wayne Dean, who, while reporting to work, fell from a partially collapsed bridge when he was unable to stop in time. The interchange was later dedicated the Clarence Wayne Dean Memorial Interchange in his honor.\nIn the weeks and months that followed, traffic was rerouted to San Fernando Road through the pass as reconstruction efforts began. The interchange was partially reopened on July 8, and completed in 1995 with additional reinforcing on the overpass support columns.\n2007 tunnel fire.\nAround 11:00\u00a0p.m. &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Daylight%20Time\"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt; on October 12, 2007, two trucks collided in the northernmost of two two-lane &lt;a href=\"tunnel\"&gt;tunnel&lt;/a&gt;s that take the southbound &lt;a href=\"truck%20bypass\"&gt;truck bypass&lt;/a&gt; roadway under the eight mainlanes of &lt;a href=\"Interstate%205%20in%20California\"&gt;I-5&lt;/a&gt; where it travels adjacent to the northbound truck bypass lanes. The tunnel is a long reinforced concrete box girder, built in 1975. It was last inspected in April 2007, and no problems were found.\nThirty commercial vehicles and one passenger vehicle were involved in the &lt;a href=\"traffic%20collision\"&gt;traffic collision&lt;/a&gt;. A resulting &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; soon spread from vehicle to vehicle, eventually encompassing the entire tunnel with flames shooting nearly outside the tunnel and burning at around .. Three people died\u2014including a 38-year-old male truck driver and his 6-year-old male passenger\u2014and ten people were injured, none critically.\nAs a result of the accident and ensuing fire, all lanes of I-5 between Calgrove Boulevard and SR\u00a014 were closed. In addition, the southbound onramps between &lt;a href=\"California%20State%20Route%20126\"&gt;SR\u00a0126&lt;/a&gt; and Calgrove Boulevard were closed along with the northbound approaches from SR\u00a014 and I-210.\nFirefighters finished removing debris from the tunnel at 7:00\u00a0a.m. on October 14. Inspectors found heavy damage to the tunnel walls under the north portal. They also found a lot of &lt;a href=\"spalling\"&gt;spalling&lt;/a&gt; and exposed &lt;a href=\"rebar\"&gt;rebar&lt;/a&gt;, both of which can cause a loss of vertical support. However, the tunnel roof (or bridge) was found to be sound. The &lt;a href=\"California%20Department%20of%20Transportation\"&gt;California Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; (Caltrans) worked through the weekend of October 13 and 14 to clear out and install five shoring supports inside the tunnel. At 4:20\u00a0p.m. on October 14, Caltrans opened up the two northbound truck bypass lanes to all traffic.\nOn Monday, October 15, the southbound mainline lanes of I-5 were reopened at 1:00\u00a0a.m. The northbound mainlane lanes were reopened two hours later. The speed limit on the southbound lanes was lowered to to help with the flow due to heavier congestion than normal. Emergency funding for the repairs was authorized for the damaged tunnel. Contractor &lt;a href=\"C.%20C.%20Myers\"&gt;C. C. Myers&lt;/a&gt; was placed on site with materials and workers to perform any needed repairs. During the repairs, the southbound I-5 truck lanes remained closed, while southbound trucks through the interchange were diverted onto the auto lanes.\nThe southbound I-5 truck lanes were reopened on Thursday, November 15, 2007. Security Paving of Oxnard performed the remaining repairs and made safety improvements to the tunnel which included the following:\nIn addition, the speed limit on the tunnel was lowered back to .\nProjects.\nHOV Direct Connector Project.\nIn 2013, Caltrans completed an elevated HOV (high-occupancy vehicle) direct connector ramp, linking the recently completed I-5 HOV lanes to the existing SR\u00a014 HOV lanes. This direct connector allows motorists a freeway-to-freeway transfer without exiting the carpool lane.\nI-5 HOV/Truck Lane Project.\nCaltrans is currently carrying out environmental review of the I-5 HOV/Truck Lanes Project. This project will widen I-5 from the Newhall Pass Interchange north to Parker Road with new HOV lanes and truck lanes. The new HOV and truck lanes would connect with the existing HOV and truck lanes of the Newhall Pass Interchange. This project will cost approximately $2.8\u00a0billion.\nIn popular culture.\nThe interchange appears briefly in the 2015 disaster film \"&lt;a href=\"San%20Andreas%20%28film%29\"&gt;San Andreas&lt;/a&gt;\", where it collapses yet again during a 9.1 earthquake.\nThe setting for the Doobie Brothers' 1973 album \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Captain%20and%20Me\"&gt;The Captain and Me&lt;/a&gt;\" features the interchange after it collapsed from the 1971 Sylmar earthquake.\nThe interchange features in the &lt;a href=\"P.O.D.\"&gt;P.O.D.&lt;/a&gt; music video for \"&lt;a href=\"Alive%20%28P.O.D.%20song%29\"&gt;Alive&lt;/a&gt;\"."
