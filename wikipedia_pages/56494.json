    "text": "Bergen (), historically Bj\u00f8rgvin, is a city and &lt;a href=\"municipalities%20of%20Norway\"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vestland\"&gt;Vestland&lt;/a&gt; county on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Norway\"&gt;west coast&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;. , its population is roughly 285,900. Bergen is the &lt;a href=\"list%20of%20towns%20and%20cities%20in%20Norway\"&gt;second-largest&lt;/a&gt; city in Norway. The municipality covers and is on the peninsula of &lt;a href=\"Bergenshalv%C3%B8yen\"&gt;Bergenshalv\u00f8yen&lt;/a&gt;. The city centre and northern neighbourhoods are on &lt;a href=\"Byfjorden%20%28Hordaland%29\"&gt;Byfjorden&lt;/a&gt;, 'the city fjord', and the city is surrounded by mountains; Bergen is known as the \"city of &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Mountains%2C%20Bergen\"&gt;seven mountains&lt;/a&gt;\". Many of the extra-municipal suburbs are on islands. Bergen is the administrative centre of Vestland county. The city consists of eight boroughs: &lt;a href=\"Arna%2C%20Norway\"&gt;Arna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bergenhus\"&gt;Bergenhus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fana\"&gt;Fana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fyllingsdalen\"&gt;Fyllingsdalen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laksev%C3%A5g\"&gt;Laksev\u00e5g&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ytrebygda\"&gt;Ytrebygda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%85rstad%2C%20Bergen\"&gt;\u00c5rstad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%C3%85sane\"&gt;\u00c5sane&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrading in Bergen may have started as early as the 1020s. According to tradition, the city was founded in 1070 by king &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20III%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Olav Kyrre&lt;/a&gt; and was named Bj\u00f8rgvin, 'the green meadow among the mountains'. It served as Norway's capital in the 13th century, and from the end of the 13th century became a &lt;a href=\"Kontor\"&gt;bureau city&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20League\"&gt;Hanseatic League&lt;/a&gt;. Until 1789, Bergen enjoyed exclusive rights to mediate trade between &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Norway\"&gt;Northern Norway&lt;/a&gt; and abroad and it was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s when it was overtaken by the capital, Christiania (now known as &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;). What remains of the quays, &lt;a href=\"Bryggen\"&gt;Bryggen&lt;/a&gt;, is a World Heritage Site. The city was hit by numerous fires over the years. The &lt;a href=\"Bergen%20School%20of%20Meteorology\"&gt;Bergen School of Meteorology&lt;/a&gt; was developed at the &lt;a href=\"Geophysical%20Institute%2C%20University%20of%20Bergen\"&gt;Geophysical Institute&lt;/a&gt; starting in 1917, the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20School%20of%20Economics\"&gt;Norwegian School of Economics&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 1936, and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Bergen\"&gt;University of Bergen&lt;/a&gt; in 1946. From 1831 to 1972, Bergen was its own &lt;a href=\"counties%20of%20Norway\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt;. In 1972 the municipality absorbed four surrounding municipalities and became a part of Hordaland county.\nThe city is an international center for aquaculture, shipping, the offshore petroleum industry and subsea technology, and a national centre for higher education, media, tourism and finance. &lt;a href=\"Bergen%20Port\"&gt;Bergen Port&lt;/a&gt; is Norway's busiest in terms of both freight and passengers, with over 300 cruise ship calls a year bringing nearly a half a million passengers to Bergen, a number that has doubled in 10 years. Almost half of the passengers are German or British. The city's main football team is &lt;a href=\"SK%20Brann\"&gt;SK Brann&lt;/a&gt; and a unique tradition of the city is the &lt;a href=\"buekorps\"&gt;buekorps&lt;/a&gt;. Natives speak a distinct dialect, known as &lt;a href=\"Bergensk\"&gt;Bergensk&lt;/a&gt;. The city features &lt;a href=\"Bergen%20Airport%2C%20Flesland\"&gt;Bergen Airport, Flesland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bergen%20Light%20Rail\"&gt;Bergen Light Rail&lt;/a&gt;, and is the terminus of the &lt;a href=\"Bergen%20Line\"&gt;Bergen Line&lt;/a&gt;. Four large bridges connect Bergen to its suburban municipalities.\nBergen has a mild winter climate, though with a lot of precipitation. From December to March, Bergen can be, in rare cases, up to 20\u00a0\u00b0C warmer than Oslo, even though both cities are at about 60\u00b0 North. The Gulf Stream keeps the sea relatively warm, considering the latitude, and the mountains protect the city from cold winds from the north, north-east and east.\nHistory.\nThe city of Bergen was traditionally thought to have been founded by king &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20III%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Olav Kyrre&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Harald%20III%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Harald Hardr\u00e5de&lt;/a&gt; in 1070AD, four years after the Viking Age in England ended with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stamford%20Bridge\"&gt;Battle of Stamford Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Modern research has, however, discovered that a trading settlement had already been established in the 1020s or 1030s.\nBergen gradually assumed the function of capital of Norway in the early 13th century, as the first city where a rudimentary central administration was established. The city's cathedral was the site of the first royal coronation in Norway in the 1150s, and continued to host royal coronations throughout the 13th century. &lt;a href=\"Bergenhus%20fortress\"&gt;Bergenhus fortress&lt;/a&gt; dates from the 1240s and guards the entrance to the harbour in Bergen. The functions of the capital city were lost to &lt;a href=\"Oslo\"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; during the reign of King &lt;a href=\"Haakon%20V%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Haakon V&lt;/a&gt; (1299\u20131319).\nIn the middle of the 14th century, North German merchants, who had already been present in substantial numbers since the 13th century, founded one of the four \"\" of the &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20League\"&gt;Hanseatic League&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Bryggen\"&gt;Bryggen&lt;/a&gt; in Bergen. The principal export traded from Bergen was dried cod from the northern Norwegian coast, which started around 1100. The city was granted a monopoly for trade from the north of Norway by King &lt;a href=\"H%C3%A5kon%20H%C3%A5konsson\"&gt;H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson&lt;/a&gt; (1217\u20131263). &lt;a href=\"Stockfish\"&gt;Stockfish&lt;/a&gt; was the main reason that the city became one of North Europe's largest centres for trade. By the late 14th century, Bergen had established itself as the centre of the trade in Norway. The &lt;a href=\"Hanseatic%20League\"&gt;Hanseatic&lt;/a&gt; merchants lived in their own separate quarter of the town, where &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Low%20German\"&gt;Middle Low German&lt;/a&gt; was used, enjoying &lt;a href=\"exclusive%20right\"&gt;exclusive right&lt;/a&gt;s to trade with the northern fishermen who each summer sailed to Bergen. The Hansa community resented Scottish merchants who settled in Bergen, and on 9 November 1523 several Scottish households were targeted by German residents. Today, Bergen's old quayside, [[Bryggen]], is on [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.[[File:BergenHordalandNorwayVagen.jpg|thumb|left|An historic [[photochrom]] of Bergen near the end of the 19th century. Visible are [[Bergen Cathedral]] (\"Domkirken\") in the bottom left corner, [[Holy Cross Church, Bergen|Holy Cross Church]] in the middle, the bay ([[V\u00e5gen, Bergen|V\u00e5gen]]) with its many boats and the [[Bergenhus Fortress]] to the right of the opening of V\u00e5gen.]]\nIn 1349, the [[Black Death]] was brought to Norway by an English ship arriving in Bergen. Later outbreaks occurred in 1618, 1629 and 1637, on each occasion taking about 3,000 lives. In the 15th century, the city was attacked several times by the [[Victual Brothers]], and in 1429 they succeeded in burning the royal castle and much of the city. In 1665, the city's harbour was the site of the [[Battle of V\u00e5gen]], when an English naval flotilla attacked a Dutch merchant and treasure fleet supported by the city's garrison. Accidental fires sometimes got out of control, and one in 1702 reduced most of the town to ashes.\nThroughout the 15th and 16th centuries, Bergen remained one of the largest cities in [[Scandinavia]], and it was Norway's biggest city until the 1830s, when the capital city of [[Oslo]] became the largest. From around 1600, the Hanseatic dominance of the city's trade gradually declined in favour of Norwegian merchants (often of Hanseatic ancestry), and in the 1750s, the Hanseatic ' finally closed. Bergen retained its monopoly of trade with northern Norway until 1789. The Bergen stock exchange, the ', was established in 1813.\nModern history.\nBergen was separated from Hordaland as a county of its own in 1831. It was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see ). The [[rural municipality]] of was merged with Bergen on 1 January 1877. The rural municipality of [[\u00c5rstad, Bergen|\u00c5rstad]] was merged with Bergen on 1 July 1915.\nDuring World War II, Bergen was occupied on the first day of the German invasion on 9 April 1940, after a brief fight between German ships and the Norwegian [[coastal artillery]]. The [[Norwegian resistance movement]] groups in Bergen were [[Osvald Group|Saborg]], [[Milorg]], \"\", [[Sivorg]], ' and the Communist Party. On 20 April 1944, during the German occupation, the Dutch cargo ship ' anchored off the [[Bergenhus Fortress]], loaded with over 120 tons of explosives, and blew up, killing at least 150 people and damaging historic buildings. The city was subject to some Allied [[strategic bombing|bombing raids]], aimed at German naval installations in the harbour. Some of these caused Norwegian civilian casualties numbering about 100.\nBergen is also well known in Norway for the [[Isdal Woman]] (), an unidentified person who was found dead at Isdalen (\"Ice Valley\") on 29 November 1970. The unsolved case encouraged international speculation over the years and it remains one of the most profound mysteries in recent Norwegian history.\nThe rural municipalities of [[Arna, Norway|Arna]], [[Fana]], [[Laksev\u00e5g]], and [[\u00c5sane]] were merged with Bergen on 1 January 1972. The city lost its status as a separate county on the same date, and Bergen is now a [[list of municipalities of Norway|municipality]], in the county of [[Vestland]].\nFires.\nThe city's history is marked by numerous great fires. In 1198, the faction set fire to the city in connection with a battle against the faction during the civil war. In 1248, and burned, and 11 churches were destroyed. In 1413 another fire struck the city, and 14 churches were destroyed. In 1428 the city was plundered by the [[Victual Brothers]], and in 1455, [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] merchants were responsible for burning down [[Munkeliv Abbey]]. In 1476, burned down in a fire started by a drunk trader. In 1582, another fire hit the city centre and . In 1675, 105 buildings burned down in . In 1686 another great fire hit , destroying 231 city blocks and 218 boathouses. The greatest fire in history was in 1702, when 90% of the city was burned to ashes. In 1751, there was a great fire at . In 1756, yet another fire at burned down 1,500 buildings, and further great fires hit in 1771 and 1901. In 1916, 300 buildings burned down in the city centre, and in 1955 parts of burned down.\nToponymy.\nBergen is pronounced in English or and in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (in [[Bergensk|the local dialect]] ). The [[Old Norse]] forms of the name were ' and ' (and in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] the city is still called '). The first element is (n.) or ' (n.), which translates as 'mountain(s)'. The last element is (f.), which means a new settlement where there used to be a pasture or meadow. The full meaning is then \"the meadow among the mountains\". This is a suitable name: Bergen is often called \"the city among the seven mountains\". It was the playwright [[Ludvig Holberg]] who felt so inspired by the [[seven hills of Rome]], that he decided that his home town must be blessed with a corresponding seven mountains \u2013 and locals still argue which seven they are.\nIn 1918, there was a campaign to reintroduce the Norse form ' as the name of the city. This was turned down \u2013 but as a compromise, the name of the [[diocese]] was changed to '.\nGeography.\n[[File:TettstedetBergen.jpg|thumb|left|Bergen: Urban areas ([[Statistics Norway]])]]\nBergen occupies most of the peninsula of [[Bergenshalv\u00f8yen]] in the [[districts of Norway|district]] of [[Midthordland]] in mid-western Hordaland. The municipality covers an area of . Most of the urban area is on or close to a fjord or bay, although the urban area has several mountains. The city centre is surrounded by the [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|Seven Mountains]], although there is disagreement as to which of the nine mountains constitute these. [[Ulriken]], [[Fl\u00f8yen]], [[L\u00f8vstakken]] and [[Damsg\u00e5rdsfjellet]] are always included as well as three of [[Lyderhorn]], [[Sandviksfjellet]], [[Bl\u00e5manen]], [[Rundemanen]] and [[Kolbeinsvarden]]. [[Gullfjellet]] is Bergen's highest mountain, at [[above mean sea level]].\nBergen is sheltered from the North Sea by the islands [[Ask\u00f8y]], [[Holsn\u00f8y]] (the municipality of [[Meland]]) and [[Sotra]] (the municipalities of [[Fjell]] and [[Sund, Norway|Sund]]). Bergen borders the municipalities [[Alver (municipality)|Alver]] and [[Oster\u00f8y]] to the north, [[Vaksdal]] and [[Samnanger]] to the east, [[Os, Hordaland|Os]] ([[Bj\u00f8rnafjorden (municipality)|Bj\u00f8rnafjorden]]) and [[Austevoll]] to the south, and [[\u00d8ygarden]] and [[Ask\u00f8y]] to the west.\nClimate.\n[[File:Bergen v\u00e5gsallmenningen rain.jpg|thumb|left|Bergen on a rainy day]]\nBergen has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: \"Cfb\"), with plentiful rainfall in all seasons; with intermittent snowfall during winter, but the snow usually melts quickly in the city. Average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] during 1961\u201390 was . This is because Bergen is surrounded by mountains that cause moist [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] air to undergo [[orographic lift]], yielding abundant rainfall. It rained every day from 29 October 2006 to 21 January 2007: 85 consecutive days. The highest temperature ever recorded was on 26 July 2019, beating the previous record from 2018 at 32.6 degrees, and the lowest was in January 1987. Bergen is considered the rainiest city in [[Europe]], although it is not the wettest \"place\" on the continent.\nBergen's weather is much warmer than the city's latitude (60.4\u00b0 N) might suggest. Temperatures below \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C (14\u00a0\u00b0F) are rare. Summer temperatures sometimes reach the upper 20s, temperatures over 30\u00b0C were previously only seen a few days each decade. The growing season in Bergen is exceptionally long for its latitude, with more than 200 days. Its mild winters and proximity to the Gulf stream move the plant hardiness zone between 8b and 9a depending on location. \nThe high precipitation is often used in the marketing of the city, and features to a degree on postcards sold in the city. Compared to areas behind the mountains on the Scandinavian peninsula, Bergen is much wetter and has a more narrow range of temperature, with mild summers and cool winters. In fact, winters are very mild considering its high latitude, though not warmer than Denmark despite its coastal location and as much as milder than on the [[Baltic Sea]] coasts of [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] on the same latitude. Summers tend to be significantly more variable. The old sunshine hours data was from the met office in the city; at this location sunlight is obscured by mountains, especially by Ulriken. A new sunrecorder was established at Bergen Airport in December 2015, and this records from 1450 to 1750 (2018) hours of sunshine.\nDemographics.\n, the municipality had a population of 283,929, making the population density 599 people per km2. , the main urban area of Bergen had 254,235 residents and covered an area of . Other urban areas, as defined by [[Statistics Norway]], consist of [[Indre Arna]] (6,536 residents on 1 January 2012), [[Fanahammeren]] (3,690), [[Ytre Arna]] (2,626), [[Hylkje]] (2,277) and [[Espeland]] (2,182).\nEthnic [[Norwegians]] make up 84.5% of Bergen's residents. In addition, 8.1% were [[Immigrant generations|first]] or second generation immigrants of Western background and 7.4% were first or second generation immigrants of non-Western background. The population grew by 4,549 people in 2009, a growth rate of 1,8%. Ninety-six percent of the population lives in urban areas. As of 2002, the average [[gross income]] for men above the age of 17 is 426,000 [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK), the average gross income for women above the age of 17 is NOK238,000, with the total average gross income being NOK330,000. In 2007, there were 104.6 men for every 100 women in the age group of 20\u201339. 22.8% of the population were under 17years of age, while 4.5% were 80 and above.\nThe immigrant population (those with two foreign-born parents) in Bergen, includes 42,169 individuals with backgrounds from more than 200 countries representing 15.5% of the city's population (2014). Of these, 50.2% have background from Europe, 28.9% from Asia, 13.1% from Africa, 5.5% from Latin America, 1.9% from North America, and 0.4% from Oceania. The immigrant population in Bergen in the period 1993\u20132008 increased by 119.7%, while the ethnic Norwegian population grew by 8.1% during the same period. The national average is 138.0% and 4.2%. The immigrant population has thus accounted for 43.6% of Bergen's population growth and 60.8% of Norway's population growth during the period 1993\u20132008, compared with 84.5% in Oslo.\nThe immigrant population in Bergen has changed a lot since 1970. As of 1 January 1986, there were 2,870 people with a non-Western immigrant background in Bergen. In 2006, this figure had increased to 14,630, so the non-Western immigrant population in Bergen was five times higher than in 1986. This is a slightly slower growth than the national average, which has sextupled during the same period. Also in relation to the total population in Bergen, the proportion of non-Westerns increased significantly. In 1986, the proportion of the total population in the municipality of non-Western background was 3.6%. In January 2006, people with a non-Western immigrant background accounted for 6 percent of the population in Bergen. The share of Western immigrants has remained stable at around 2% in the period. The number of [[Poles]] in Bergen rose from 697 in 2006 to 3,128 in 2010.\nThe [[Church of Norway]] is the largest denomination in Bergen, with 201,006 (79.74%) registered adherents in 2012. Bergen is the seat of the [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] with [[Bergen Cathedral]] as its centrepiece, while [[St John's Church, Bergen|St John's Church]] is the city's most prominent. As of 2012, the state church is followed by 52,059 irreligious, 4,947 members of various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[free church]]es, 3,873 actively registered Catholics, 2,707 registered Muslims, 816 registered Hindus, 255 registered [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] and 147 registered [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]].\nCityscape.\n[[File:Floyen night.jpg|thumb|left|Night view of Bergen from Mount [[Floyen]]]]\nThe city centre of Bergen lies in the west of the municipality, facing the fjord of [[Byfjorden (Hordaland)|Byfjorden]]. It is among a group of mountains known as the [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|Seven Mountains]], although the number is a matter of definition. From here, the urban area of Bergen extends to the north, west and south, and to its east is a large mountain massif. Outside the city centre and the surrounding neighbourhoods (i.e. [[\u00c5rstad, Bergen|\u00c5rstad]], inner [[Laksev\u00e5g]] and [[Sandviken, Norway|Sandviken]]), the majority of the population lives in relatively sparsely populated residential areas built after 1950. While some are dominated by [[apartment|apartment building]]s and modern [[terraced house]]s (e.g. [[Fyllingsdalen]]), others are dominated by [[single-family detached home|single-family home]]s.\n[[File:SkansenSeptember2007 2.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the city centre with [[Torgallmenningen]]]]\nThe oldest part of Bergen is the area around the bay of V\u00e5gen in the city centre. Originally centred on the bay's eastern side, Bergen eventually expanded west and southwards. Few buildings from the oldest period remain, the most significant being [[St Mary's Church, Bergen|St Mary's Church]] from the 12th century. For several hundred years, the extent of the city remained almost constant. The population was stagnant, and the city limits were narrow. In 1702, seven-eighths of the city burned. Most of the old buildings of Bergen, including Bryggen (which was rebuilt in a mediaeval style), were built after the fire. The fire marked a transition from [[tar]] covered houses, as well as the remaining [[log home|log house]]s, to painted and some brick-covered wooden buildings.\n[[File:Bergen mariakirken2 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[St Mary's Church, Bergen|St Mary's Church]]]]\nThe last half of the 19th century saw a period of rapid expansion and modernisation. The fire of 1855 west of [[Torgallmenningen]] led to the development of regularly sized city blocks in this area of the city centre. The city limits were expanded in 1876, and [[Nyg\u00e5rd, Norway|Nyg\u00e5rd]], [[M\u00f8hlenpris]] and [[Sandviken, Norway|Sandviken]] were urbanized with large-scale construction of city blocks housing both the poor and the wealthy. Their architecture is influenced by a variety of styles; [[historicism (art)|historicism]], [[classicism]] and [[Art Nouveau]]. The wealthy built villas between M\u00f8hlenpris and Nyg\u00e5rd, and on the side of Mount Fl\u00f8yen; these areas were also added to Bergen in 1876. Simultaneously, an urbanization process was taking place in [[Solheimsviken]] in \u00c5rstad, at that time outside the Bergen municipality, centred on the large industrial activity in the area. The workers' homes in this area were poorly built, and little remains after large-scale redevelopment in the 1960s-1980s.\nAfter \u00c5rstad became a part of Bergen in 1916, a development plan was applied to the new area. Few city blocks akin to those in Nyg\u00e5rd and M\u00f8hlenpris were planned. Many of the worker class built their own homes, and many small, detached apartment buildings were built. After World War II, Bergen had again run short of land to build on, and, contrary to the original plans, many large apartment buildings were built in [[Land\u00e5s]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Bergen acquired [[Fyllingsdalen]] from [[Fana (municipality)|Fana]] municipality in 1955. Like similar areas in Oslo (e.g. [[Lambertseter]]), Fyllingsdalen was developed into a modern suburb with large apartment buildings, [[Tower block|mid-rise]]s, and some single-family homes, in the 1960s and 1970s. Similar developments took place beyond Bergen's city limits, for example in [[Loddefjord]].\n[[File:06.05.25 16 Fra Nordnes i Bergen.JPG|thumb|200x200px|View from the Nordnes part of Bergen.]]\nAt the same time as [[New town|planned city]] expansion took place inside Bergen, its extra-municipal suburbs also grew rapidly. Wealthy citizens of Bergen had been living in Fana since the 19th century, but as the city expanded it became more convenient to settle in the municipality. Similar processes took place in [[\u00c5sane]] and Laksev\u00e5g. Most of the homes in these areas are detached [[Terraced house|row house]]s, single family homes or small apartment buildings. After the surrounding municipalities were merged with Bergen in 1972, expansion has continued in largely the same manner, although the municipality encourages condensing near commercial centres, future [[Bergen Light Rail]] stations, and elsewhere.\nAs part of the modernisation wave of the 1950s and 1960s, and due to damage caused by World War II, the [[Local government|city government]] ambitiously planned redevelopment of many areas in central Bergen. The plans involved demolition of several neighbourhoods of wooden houses, namely [[Nordnes]], Marken, and St\u00f8len. None of the plans was carried out in its original form; the Marken and St\u00f8len redevelopment plans were discarded and that of Nordnes only carried out in the area that had been most damaged by war. The city council of Bergen had in 1964 voted to demolish the entirety of Marken, however, the decision proved to be highly controversial and the decision was reversed in 1974. Bryggen was under threat of being wholly or partly demolished after the fire of 1955, when a large number of the buildings burned to the ground. Instead of being demolished, the remaining buildings were restored and accompanied by reconstructions of some of the burned buildings.\nDemolition of old buildings and occasionally whole city blocks is still taking place, the most recent major example being the 2007 razing of Jonsvollskvartalet at N\u00f8stet.\n[[Billboard]]s are banned in the city.\nAdministration.\n[[File:Kong Oscars gate, Bergen 2018.jpg|thumb|[[Kong Oscars gate]]]]Since 2000, the city of Bergen has been governed by a city government (\"byr\u00e5d\") based on the principle of [[parliamentary system|parliamentarism]]. The government consists of seven government members called commissioners, and is appointed by the city council, the supreme authority of the city.\nThis is the political party breakdown of the current and historical city councils:\nBoroughs.\n[[File:Bergen boroughs.png|thumb|right|Boroughs of Bergen]]\nBergen is divided into eight boroughs, as seen on the map to the right. Clockwise, starting with the northernmost, the boroughs are [[\u00c5sane]], [[Arna, Norway|Arna]], [[Fana]], [[Ytrebygda]], [[Fyllingsdalen]], [[Laksev\u00e5g]], [[\u00c5rstad, Bergen|\u00c5rstad]] and [[Bergenhus]]. The city centre is located in [[Bergenhus]]. Parts of Fana, Ytrebygda, \u00c5sane and Arna are not part of the Bergen urban area, explaining why the municipality has approximately 20,000 more inhabitants than the urban area.\nLocal borough administrations have varied since Bergen's expansion in 1972. From 1974, each borough had a politically chosen administration. From 1989, Bergen was divided into 12 health and social districts, each locally administered. From 2000 to 2004, the former organizational form with eight politically chosen local administrations was again in use and from 2008 through to 2010, a similar form existed where the local administrations had less power than previously.\n(Pertaining to the table above: The acreage figures include fresh water and uninhabited mountain areas, except: \n1 1 The borough Bergenhus is , the rest is water and uninhabited mountain areas.\n2 2 The borough \u00c5rstad is , the rest is water and uninhabited mountain areas.)\nFormer borough: Sentrum\nSentrum (literally, \"Centre\") was a borough (with [[Bergenhus#Sentrum|the same name as a present-day neighbourhood]]).

The hotels in the city may be full at times, due to the increasing number of tourists and conferences. Bergen is recognized as the unofficial capital of the region known as [[Western Norway]], and recognized and marketed as the gateway city to the world-famous [[fjord]]s of Norway, and for that reason, it has become Norway's largest \u2013 and one of Europe's largest \u2013 [[cruise ship]] ports of call.\nTransport.\n[[File:Hurtigruten - Bergen, Norway.jpg|thumb|[[Hurtigruten]]]]\n[[Bergen Airport, Flesland]], is located from the city centre, at [[Flesland]].

There are plans to move the port out of the city centre, but no location has been chosen. [[Fjord Line]] operates a [[cruiseferry]] service to [[Hirtshals]], Denmark. Bergen is the southern terminus of [[Hurtigruten]], the Coastal Express, which operates with daily services along the coast to [[Kirkenes]].

It was strongly influenced by [[Low German]]-speaking merchants from the mid-14th to mid-18th centuries. During the [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Dano-Norwegian period]] from 1536 to 1814, Bergen was more influenced by [[Danish language|Danish]] than other areas of Norway. The Danish influence removed the female [[grammatical gender]] in the 16th century, making Bergensk one of very few Norwegian dialects with only two instead of three grammatical genders. The Rs are [[uvular trill]]s, as in French, which probably spread to Bergen some time in the 18th century, overtaking the [[alveolar trill]] in the time span of two to three generations. Owing to an improved [[literacy rate]], Bergensk was influenced by [[Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l|riksm\u00e5l]] and bokm\u00e5l in the 19th and 20th centuries. This led to large parts of the German-inspired [[vocabulary]] disappearing and pronunciations shifting slightly towards East Norwegian.\nThe [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986 edition]] of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] took place in Bergen.

Bergen is also known as the \"[[black metal]] capital of Norway\", due to its role in the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] and the amount of acts to come from the city in the early 1990s.\n[[File:Che and Fidel Graffiti Bergen Norway.JPG|thumb|upright .8|\"[[Che Guevara|Che]]\" by [[DOLK (artist)|Dolk]] is painted on a building at [[Strandkaien]]]]\nStreet art.\nBergen is considered to be the street art capital of Norway. Famed artist [[Banksy]] visited the city in 2000 and inspired many to start creating street art. Soon after, the city brought up the most famous street artist in Norway: [[DOLK (artist)|Dolk]]. His art can still be seen in several places in the city, and in 2009 the city council choose to preserve [[DOLK (artist)|Dolk]]'s work \"Spray\" with protective glass. In 2011, Bergen council launched a plan of action for street art in Bergen from 2011 to 2015 to ensure that \"Bergen will lead the fashion for street art as an expression both in [[Norway]] and [[Scandinavia]]\".\nThe Madam Felle (1831\u20131908) monument in Sandviken, is in honour of a Norwegian woman of German origin, who in the mid-19th century managed, against the will of the council, to maintain a counter of beer. A well-known restaurant of the same name is now situated at another location in Bergen. The monument was erected in 1990 by sculptor Kari Rolfsen, supported by an anonymous donor. Madam Felle, civil name Oline Fell, was remembered after her death in a popular song, possibly originally a folksong, \"Kjenner Dokker Madam Felle?\" by [[Lothar Lindtner]] and [[Rolf Berntzen]] on an album in 1977.\nNeighbourhoods.\n[[File:Gamlehaugen castle in Bergen, Norway.jpg|thumb|[[Gamlehaugen]] castle in Bergen, the Norwegian Royal Family's residence in Bergen]]\nThe traditional neighbourhoods of Bergen include [[Bryggen]], Eidemarken, Engen, Fjellet,\n[[Kalfaret]], Ladeg\u00e5rden, [[L\u00f8vstakksiden]], Marken, [[Minde, Bergen|Minde]],\n[[M\u00f8hlenpris]], [[Nordnes]], [[Nyg\u00e5rd, Norway|Nyg\u00e5rd]], N\u00f8stet, [[Sandviken, Norway|Sandviken]],\nSentrum, Skansen, Skuteviken, Strandsiden, St\u00f8len, [[Sydnes]],\n[[Verftet]], V\u00e5gsbunnen, Wergeland, and Ytre Sandviken.\n\"Grunnkretser\".\nThe various addresses in Bergen, each belong to one of the various \"[[grunnkrets]]\".\nInternational business.\nEach year Bergen sells the [[Christmas tree|Christmas Tree]] seen in Newcastle's Haymarket as a sign of the ongoing friendship between the sister cities.
