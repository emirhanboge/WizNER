    "text": "The is a &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20language\"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; poem. Originally the poem was attributed to the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Shingon\"&gt;Shingon&lt;/a&gt; Esoteric sect of Buddhism in Japan, &lt;a href=\"K%C5%ABkai\"&gt;K\u016bkai&lt;/a&gt;, but more modern research has found the date of composition to be later in the &lt;a href=\"Heian%20period\"&gt;Heian period&lt;/a&gt; (794\u20131179). The first record of its existence dates from 1079. It is famous because it is a perfect &lt;a href=\"pangram\"&gt;pangram&lt;/a&gt;, containing each character of the &lt;a href=\"Kana\"&gt;Japanese syllabary&lt;/a&gt; exactly once. Because of this, it is also used as an &lt;a href=\"collation\"&gt;ordering&lt;/a&gt; for the syllabary, in the same way as the \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"... sequence of the Latin alphabet.\nText.\nThe first appearance of the Iroha, in was in seven lines: six with seven &lt;a href=\"morae\"&gt;morae&lt;/a&gt; each, and one with five. It was also written in &lt;a href=\"man%27y%C5%8Dgana\"&gt;man'y\u014dgana&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\u4ee5\u5442\u6ce2\u8033\u672c\u90e8\u6b62\n\u5343\u5229\u5974\u6d41\u4e4e\u548c\u52a0\n\u9918\u591a\u9023\u66fd\u6d25\u7962\u90a3\n\u826f\u725f\u6709\u70ba\u80fd\u65bc\u4e45\n\u8036\u4e07\u8a08\u4e0d\u5df1\u8863\u5929\n\u963f\u4f50\u4f0e\u55a9\u5973\u7f8e\u4e4b\n\u6075\u6bd4\u6bdb\u52e2\u9808\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nStructurally, however, the poem follows the standard 7\u20135 pattern of Japanese poetry (with one hypometric line), and in modern times it is generally written that way, in contexts where line breaks are used. The text of the poem in &lt;a href=\"hiragana\"&gt;hiragana&lt;/a&gt; (with archaic and but without voiced consonant marks) is:\nNote that:\nAn English translation by Professor &lt;a href=\"Ryuichi%20Abe\"&gt;Ryuichi Abe&lt;/a&gt; reads as:\nKomatsu Hideo has revealed that the last syllable of each line of the Man'y\u014d-gana original (), when put together, reveals a hidden sentence, \"toka [=toga] nakute shisu\" (), which means \"to die without wrong-doing\". It is thought that this might be a eulogy in praise of &lt;a href=\"K%C5%ABkai\"&gt;K\u016bkai&lt;/a&gt;, further supporting the notion that the Iroha was written after K\u016bkai's death.\nUsage.\nThe Iroha contains every kana only once, with the exception of (-\"n\"), which was not distinguished from \"mu\" in writing until the early 20th century (see &lt;a href=\"Japanese_script_reform%23Pre-World_War_II_reforms\"&gt;Japanese script reform&lt;/a&gt;). For this reason, the poem was frequently used as an ordering of the kana until the &lt;a href=\"Meiji%20era\"&gt;Meiji era&lt;/a&gt; reforms in the 19th century. Around 1890, with the publication of the \"Wakun no Shiori\" () and \"Genkai\" () dictionaries, the \"&lt;a href=\"goj%C5%ABon\"&gt;goj\u016bon&lt;/a&gt;\" (, literally \"fifty sounds\") ordering system, which is based on Sanskrit, became more common. It begins with \"a\", \"i\", \"u\", \"e\", \"o\" then \"ka\", \"ki\", \"ku\"... and so on for each kana used in Japanese. Although the earliest known copy of the \"goj\u016bon\" predated the Iroha, \"goj\u016bon\" was considered too scholarly and had not been widely used.\nEven after widespread use of \"goj\u016bon\" in education and dictionaries, the \"Iroha\" sequence was commonly used as a system of showing order, similarly to \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"... in English. For example, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20submarines\"&gt;Imperial Japanese Navy submarines&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt; had official designations beginning with \"I\" (displacement 1,000 tonnes or more), \"Ro\" (500 to 999 tonnes), and \"Ha\" (less than 500 tonnes). Also, Japanese tanks had official designations partly using \"Iroha\" ordering, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Type%2097%20Chi-Ha%23Japanese%20tank%20designations\"&gt;Chi-ha&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"ha\" meaning the third model). Other examples include subsection ordering in documents, seat numbering in theaters, and showing &lt;a href=\"Go%20%28board%20game%29\"&gt;go&lt;/a&gt; moves in diagrams (&lt;a href=\"kifu\"&gt;kifu&lt;/a&gt;).\nCurrent uses.\nThe \"Iroha\" sequence is still used today in many areas with long traditions. Most notably, officially use \"Iroha\" for lower-level subsection ordering purposes, for example (Article 49, Section 2, Subsection 1-\"ro\"). In official translation to English, \"i\", \"ro\", \"ha\"... are replaced by \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"... as in \"49(2)(i)(b)\".\nIn music, the &lt;a href=\"Musical%20note\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;s of an &lt;a href=\"octave\"&gt;octave&lt;/a&gt; are named \"i ro ha ni ho he to\", written in &lt;a href=\"katakana\"&gt;katakana&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Iroha\" is also used in numbering the classes of the conventional train cars of &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20National%20Railways\"&gt;Japanese National Railways&lt;/a&gt; (now known as &lt;a href=\"Japan%20Railways%20Group\"&gt;JR&lt;/a&gt;). \"I\" is first class (no longer used), \"Ro\" is second class (now \"Green car\") and \"Ha\" is third class (standard carriages).\nSome Japanese expressions are only understandable when one has knowledge of the \"Iroha\". The word \"iroha\" (, often in katakana) itself can mean \"the basics\" in Japanese, comparable to the term \"the ABCs\" in English. Similarly, \"Iroha no i\" () means \"the most basic element of all\". \"I no ichiban\" (, \"number one of \"i\"\") means \"the very first\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"karuta%23Iroha%20Karuta\"&gt;Iroha karuta&lt;/a&gt;\", a traditional card game, is still sold as an educational toy.\n\"Irohazaka\" (), a one-way switchback mountain road in &lt;a href=\"Nikk%C5%8D%2C%20Tochigi\"&gt;Nikk\u014d, Tochigi&lt;/a&gt;, is named for the poem because it has 48 corners. The route was popular with Buddhist pilgrims on their way to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ch%C5%ABzenji\"&gt;Lake Ch\u016bzenji&lt;/a&gt;, which is at the top of the forested hill that this road climbs. While the narrow road has been modernized over the years, care has been taken to keep the number of curves constant.\nOrigin.\nAuthorship is traditionally ascribed to the Heian era Japanese &lt;a href=\"Buddhism\"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; priest and scholar &lt;a href=\"K%C5%ABkai\"&gt;K\u016bkai&lt;/a&gt; () (774\u2013835). However, this is unlikely as it is believed that in his time there were separate \"e\" sounds in the \"a\" and \"ya\" columns of the kana table. The (\"e\") above would have been pronounced \"ye\", making the pangram incomplete.\nIt is said that the \"Iroha\" is a transformation of these verses in the \"&lt;a href=\"Nirvana%20Sutra\"&gt;Nirvana Sutra&lt;/a&gt;\":\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\u8af8\u884c\u7121\u5e38\n\u662f\u751f\u6ec5\u6cd5\n\u751f\u6ec5\u6ec5\u5df2\n\u5bc2\u6ec5\u70ba\u697d\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nwhich translates into\nThe above in Japanese is read\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Shogy\u014d muj\u014d\"\n\"Ze sh\u014dmepp\u014d\"\n\"Sh\u014dmetsu metsui\"\n\"Jakumetsu iraku\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;"
