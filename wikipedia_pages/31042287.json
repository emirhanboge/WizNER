    "text": "Pok Deng () is a &lt;a href=\"Gambling%20in%20Thailand\"&gt;Thai gambling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"card%20game\"&gt;card game&lt;/a&gt; in which players aim for a hand whose ones &lt;a href=\"Numerical%20digit\"&gt;digit&lt;/a&gt; beats the &lt;a href=\"croupier\"&gt;dealer&lt;/a&gt;'s, while taking into account pairs, three of a kinds, and &lt;a href=\"Flush%20%28cards%29\"&gt;flushes&lt;/a&gt;. The game is also known as Pok Kao (, \"kao\" means \"nine\") or Pok Paet Pok Kao (, \"paet\" means \"eight\") due to eights and nines being high, desirable values.\nSetup.\n\"Pok Deng\" supports two to seventeen players, including the dealer, but is recommended for three to nine players. To begin, players designate a dealer. One person may remain the dealer for several rounds or players can agree to switch off being dealer.\nEach game is fairly short, lasting several seconds to a couple of minutes. Each player, except the dealer, places a bet using &lt;a href=\"cash\"&gt;cash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"casino%20token\"&gt;chip&lt;/a&gt;s, or small objects like wrapped candy and places that bet on the table in front of himself or herself. Each player plays versus the dealer only and is not competing with fellow players. The dealer shuffles a standard 52-card deck of &lt;a href=\"playing%20card\"&gt;playing card&lt;/a&gt;s; determines whether to go &lt;a href=\"clockwise\"&gt;clockwise&lt;/a&gt; or counterclockwise; and deals two cards face down, one at a time, to each player, ending on himself or herself. The remaining cards become the draw pile.\nPlaying.\nPlay goes in the same order that the cards were dealt. During a player's turn, that person has the option of drawing a card (hitting) or not (staying). A player may only draw one card from the top of the draw pile, meaning each player ends up with only two or three cards per game. (Because each player can have up to three cards, seventeen is the maximum number of players before cards would run out.)\nIf the player's starting hand of two cards has a \"taem\" (described below) of eight or nine, that person has \"pok\" () announces it, and immediately shows those cards face-up. This is a good hand, and the player may not draw a card.\nThe dealer takes his or her turn last. If the dealer has \"pok\", those cards are turned face-up and all players' hands are compared to the dealer's. If the dealer does not have \"pok\", before deciding to draw a card, the dealer may reveal select players' hands and compare them to his or her own and make the payouts. Then the dealer may draw a card and then compare the rest of the players' hands to his or her own.\nCard values.\nThree aspects of a player's hand determine the scoring: (1) the hand type, (2) \"taem\", which is the numerical value, and (3) \"deng\", which is a special aspect that may multiply the bet.\nThe hand's numerical score, taem (), is determined by the numerical values of the cards in hand. In terms of each card's numerical values, each &lt;a href=\"ace\"&gt;ace&lt;/a&gt; has a value of one. 2 through 9 have corresponding values of two through nine. 10, &lt;a href=\"Jack%20%28playing%20card%29\"&gt;jack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20%28playing%20card%29\"&gt;queen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"King%20%28playing%20card%29\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; each have a value of zero or ten. \"Taem\", the numerical value of the overall hand, is simply the ones digit of the sum of the cards, which is why it does not matter whether the 10, jack, queen, and king count as zero or ten. For example, a hand consisting of a 3 and a 2 has a value of five \"taem\". Likewise, a hand consisting of a 7 and an 8 has a value of five \"taem\" because the sum, fifteen, has a one's digit of five. A hand with a jack and a 5 also has a value of five \"taem\" because the sum, either five or fifteen, has a one's digit of five.\nThe bet multiplier, deng (), is determined by the relationship among the cards in hand:\nThe hand type may be one of four types, in order of decreasing rank:\nScoring.\nWhen comparing, or scoring, versus the dealer, the following rules apply. A player's hand may win against, tie with, or lose against the dealer's hand. Players compete against the dealer only and do not compare against other players. The hands are compared in terms of hand type, \"taem\", and \"deng\", in that order. Generally, hand type then the \"taem\" determine who wins. The \"deng\" is a tie-breaker and also determines how much is won.\nFirst compare the hand types. If one hand has a better hand type than the other, that hand wins. The amount won is the winning hand's \"deng\" times the original bet. If both the dealer's hand and the player's hand have the same hand type, the numerical value \"taem\" is compared. If one hand has a greater \"taem\" than the other, that hand wins. The amount won is the winning hand's \"deng\". If both hands have the same hand type and \"taem\", the \"deng\" is compared. If one hand has a greater \"deng\" than the other, that hand wins the payout of the difference of the hands' \"deng\". If both hands have the same hand type, \"taem\", and \"deng\", they tie and the original bet is returned to the player.\nOne exception is if one hand has a \"tong\" and the other has \"sam lueang\". The hand with \"tong\" wins two times the bet. (This comes from five \"deng\" minus three \"deng\".)\nFor example, a \"pok deng\" of , which has eight \"taem\" two \"deng\", beats a normal hand of , which has nine \"taem\" one \"deng\", because the \"pok\" hand type beats the normal hand type. The payout is twice the original bet because the winning hand has two \"deng\". However, a \"pok\" of , which has nine \"taem\" one \"deng\", beats the \"pok deng\" of . They are both \"pok\", so the nine \"taem\" beats the eight \"taem\", and the payout, one \"deng\" from the winning hand, is equal to the amount of the original bet.\nAs another example, a normal hand of , with five \"taem\" three \"deng\", beats a normal hand of , with three \"taem\" one \"deng\", and wins three times the original bet due to the three \"deng\" of the winning hand. The same normal hand of beats a normal hand of , with five \"taem\" one \"deng\", but only wins two times the original bet because the \"taem\" are tied and the payout is the difference in \"deng\". Likewise, the same normal hand of beats a normal hand of , with five \"taem\" two \"deng\", but only wins one times the original bet.\nAdditional rules.\nThere are some additional options:\nExamples.\nThe following table starts with the best hand type, \"pok\", and goes in descending order. Examples are shown."
