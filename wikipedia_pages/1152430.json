He was named the 50th greatest African player of all time by the African football expert Ed Dove.\nEarly life.\nHadji was born in &lt;a href=\"Ifrane%20Atlas-Saghir\"&gt;Ifrane Atlas-Saghir&lt;/a&gt;, Morocco.

At Coventry, he was joined by Moroccan international, &lt;a href=\"Youssef%20Chippo\"&gt;Youssef Chippo&lt;/a&gt;, sparking a brief trend for City fans to wear &lt;a href=\"Fez%20%28clothing%29\"&gt;fezzes&lt;/a&gt; to games in their honour. After Coventry were relegated in 2001, he joined local rivals &lt;a href=\"Aston%20Villa%20F.C.\"&gt;Aston Villa&lt;/a&gt;, having scored against them three times in the previous season. But after only playing sporadically, scoring in the league against Southampton and Everton and once in the UEFA Cup against Varteks, he was released on a free transfer to &lt;a href=\"RCD%20Espanyol\"&gt;Espanyol&lt;/a&gt; in Spain where he remained until June 2004.\nHadji later played for &lt;a href=\"Al%20Ain%20FC\"&gt;Al Ain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Arab%20Emirates\"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;, where he remained for one year before returning to Europe.
