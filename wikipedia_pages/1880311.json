    "text": "\"Orinoco Flow\", also released as \"Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)\", is a song by Irish singer-songwriter &lt;a href=\"Enya\"&gt;Enya&lt;/a&gt; from her second studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Watermark%20%28Enya%20album%29\"&gt;Watermark&lt;/a&gt;\" (1988). The song was released on 3 October 1988 by &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Music%20Group\"&gt;WEA Records&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom and by &lt;a href=\"Geffen%20Records\"&gt;Geffen Records&lt;/a&gt; in the United States the following year. The song topped the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; for three weeks and received two &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award\"&gt;Grammy Award&lt;/a&gt; nominations for &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Music%20Video\"&gt;Best Music Video&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20New%20Age%20Album\"&gt;Best New Age Performance&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"32nd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;32nd Annual Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2020, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\" ranked \"Orinoco Flow\" at number 77 in its list of the 100 greatest UK number-one singles of all time.\nBackground.\nThe song was released as the lead single from Enya's studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Watermark%20%28Enya%20album%29\"&gt;Watermark&lt;/a&gt;\", on 3 October 1988. It became a global success, reaching number\u00a0one in several countries, including Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, where it stayed at the top of the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; for three weeks. In the United States, the song peaked at number\u00a024 on the &lt;a href=\"Billboard%20Hot%20100\"&gt;\"Billboard\" Hot\u00a0100&lt;/a&gt; in April\u00a01989.\nThe title of the song is an allusion both to &lt;a href=\"Miloco%20Studios\"&gt;Orinoco Studios&lt;/a&gt; (now Miloco Studios), where it was recorded, and to the &lt;a href=\"Orinoco\"&gt;river of the same name&lt;/a&gt;. Its &lt;a href=\"pizzicato\"&gt;pizzicato&lt;/a&gt; chords, generated by altering the &lt;a href=\"Roland%20D-50\"&gt;Roland D-50&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"synthesizer\"&gt;synthesizer&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Pizzagogo\" &lt;a href=\"Synthesizer%23Patch\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;, are highly recognizable as a &lt;a href=\"New%20Age%20music\"&gt;New-Age&lt;/a&gt; sound. Enya was signed to WEA by &lt;a href=\"Rob%20Dickins\"&gt;Rob Dickins&lt;/a&gt;, who served as executive producer of \"Watermark\", and the song pays homage to Dickins in the line \"with Rob Dickins at the wheel\". Co-producer &lt;a href=\"Ross%20Cullum\"&gt;Ross Cullum&lt;/a&gt; is referenced in the song with a pun on &lt;a href=\"Ross%20Dependency\"&gt;Ross Dependency&lt;/a&gt;: \"We can sigh, say goodbye/Ross and his dependencies\".\nIn 1994, the song was &lt;a href=\"Music%20licensing\"&gt;licensed&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Virgin%20Records\"&gt;Virgin Records&lt;/a&gt; for the best-selling &lt;a href=\"new-age%20music\"&gt;new-age music&lt;/a&gt; compilation album \"&lt;a href=\"Pure%20Moods\"&gt;Pure Moods&lt;/a&gt;\", which contributed to further exposure and \"helped provide a multi-platinum bonanza\" to the record company.\nIn 1998, a special-edition 10th-anniversary remix single was released.\nLyrics.\nThe lyrics have been likened to \"an itinerary for the most expensive &lt;a href=\"gap%20year\"&gt;gap year&lt;/a&gt; of all time\", mentioning an array of locations like a \"global geography lesson\". Locations mentioned in the song include &lt;a href=\"Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiree\"&gt;Tiree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peru\"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bali\"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cebu\"&gt;Cebu&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritical reception.\nNed Raggett from &lt;a href=\"AllMusic\"&gt;AllMusic&lt;/a&gt; described the song as \"distinct\" and \"downright catchy\". He noted \"its implicit dramatics, [that] gently charges instead of piling things on\".\nMusic video.\nA &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; was made to accompany the song. It features Enya singing the song in front of footage of rivers, flowers and nature, edited to have the appearance of a painting. It was directed by Michael Geoghegan. \nIn popular culture.\nAfter a significant wave of popularity, including a regular rotation on MTV, the song became \"a punch line\", representing a new-age clich\u00e9 of \"generic 'bubble bath' music\". The song was used in scenes depicting relaxation and to highlight this in a joking manner. In the 1997 \"&lt;a href=\"South%20Park\"&gt;South Park&lt;/a&gt;\" episode \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20%28South%20Park%29\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Stan%20Marsh\"&gt;Stan&lt;/a&gt;'s grandfather locks Stan in a room and plays a parody of the song performed by &lt;a href=\"Toddy%20Walters\"&gt;Toddy Walters&lt;/a&gt; to illustrate what it feels like to be old. In the \"&lt;a href=\"Brooklyn%20Nine-Nine\"&gt;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&lt;/a&gt;\" episode \"Crime and Punishment\", character Jake Peralta mentions Enya as one of his favorite musical artists. Later on, \"Orinoco Flow\" plays as he walks, in slow-motion, into a courtroom. \nIn the 2002 \"&lt;a href=\"I%27m%20Alan%20Partridge\"&gt;I'm Alan Partridge&lt;/a&gt;\" episode \"The Talented Mr.\u00a0Alan\", &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Partridge\"&gt;Alan&lt;/a&gt; is caught singing the song to himself. The song is in \"Funeral\", the sixth episode of the first series of \"&lt;a href=\"Peep%20Show%20%28British%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Peep Show&lt;/a&gt;\"; the music video is shown during the episode, and the song plays over the end credits. The song is played during &lt;a href=\"Rumpelstiltskin\"&gt;Rumpelstiltskin&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement scene in the 2010 film \"&lt;a href=\"Shrek%204\"&gt;Shrek Forever After&lt;/a&gt;\". It is also in the first season of \"&lt;a href=\"Cougar%20Town\"&gt;Cougar Town&lt;/a&gt;\"\nAlternatively, the song is also used in media to create a dissonance between the calmness of the song and starkly contrasting visuals. The song is featured during a sequence in &lt;a href=\"David%20Fincher\"&gt;David Fincher&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Girl%20with%20the%20Dragon%20Tattoo%20%282011%20film%29\"&gt;2011 adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of the novel \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Girl%20with%20the%20Dragon%20Tattoo\"&gt;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&lt;/a&gt;\", in which the &lt;a href=\"Mikael%20Blomkvist\"&gt;secondary protagonist&lt;/a&gt; is tortured while the song plays. In the \"&lt;a href=\"Black%20Mirror\"&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/a&gt;\" episode \"&lt;a href=\"Hated%20in%20the%20Nation\"&gt;Hated in the Nation&lt;/a&gt;\", one of the characters listens to the song to relax, \"shortly before she\u2019s torn apart by murderous drones\" and effectively returned Orinoco Flow to the top of the new-age charts after the episode was released. \nSimilarly, Enya's song \"&lt;a href=\"Only%20Time\"&gt;Only Time&lt;/a&gt;\" was used in &lt;a href=\"Deadpool%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2\"&gt;Deadpool\u00a02&lt;/a&gt; during a scene of \"scene of violent, slow-motion teabagging\"\nAn exception to this is the use of the song in the 2018 &lt;a href=\"Bo%20Burnham\"&gt;Bo Burnham&lt;/a&gt; film \"&lt;a href=\"Eighth%20Grade%20%28film%29\"&gt;Eighth Grade&lt;/a&gt;\". Burnham wrote to Enya directly for permission to use the song, and recognized it as a serious choice for the film; \"in \"Eighth Grade\", 'Orinoco Flow' finally gets to be itself\" rather than \"fodder for ironic laughs\".\nIn regards to using \"Orinoco Flow\" in \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\", producer &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Goor\"&gt;Dan Goor&lt;/a&gt; remarked that \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to attach ourselves to a history of making fun of it. The joke was just that it\u2019s 100 percent the wrong music to play. It\u2019s supposed to be this triumphant, badass moment, and instead we\u2019re playing that song.\u201d\nIn a 2015 interview with \"The Irish Times\", Enya said: \u201cLongevity is all any artist dreams of\u201d, rather than to dwell on how her songs are remembered. She credits \"Orinoco Flow\" for some of her cross-generational appeal, saying: \"people who used to like Orinoco Flow are now playing my music to their children\". In another interview, when asked whether people bring up \"Orinoco Flow\", she responded: \"people say 'sail away' to me or whistle bits of it back to me. I think it\u2019s wonderful I never tire of it.\"\nThe song was also used as the title song for the &lt;a href=\"Netflix\"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; comedy-drama series \"&lt;a href=\"Living%20with%20Yourself\"&gt;Living with Yourself&lt;/a&gt;\" starring &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Rudd\"&gt;Paul Rudd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aisling%20Bea\"&gt;Aisling Bea&lt;/a&gt;. The show was created by &lt;a href=\"Timothy%20Greenberg\"&gt;Timothy Greenberg&lt;/a&gt; and premiered on 18 October 2019.\nOther references.\n\"Orinoco Flow\" has also been used in reference to various object names including an iris cultivar \"Orinoco Flow\" by &lt;a href=\"iris%20%28plant%29\"&gt;iris&lt;/a&gt; breeder Cy Bartlett in 1989, and \"&lt;a href=\"Leporinus%20enyae\"&gt;Leporinus enyae&lt;/a&gt;\", a species of fish from the Orinoco drainage basin named for the artist herself.\nIn the 2017 &lt;a href=\"ITV%20%28TV%20network%29\"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt; tribute to &lt;a href=\"Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales\"&gt;Diana, Princess of Wales&lt;/a&gt;, \"Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy\", while &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Harry\"&gt;Prince Harry&lt;/a&gt; recalls his mother listening to Enya driving in her &lt;a href=\"BMW\"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; with the top down."
