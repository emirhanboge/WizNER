Affected by &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Orange\"&gt;Agent Orange&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dioxins%20and%20dioxin-like%20compounds\"&gt;dioxin&lt;/a&gt; inherited from his father, a Vietnam War soldier, T\u00f9ng was born with one blind eye. His other eye was very weak. However, since an early age, he has shown his musical talent. In a talent competition for children held in 1986-1987, he earned the Special Award.\nWhen Thanh T\u00f9ng turned 12, he became totally blind. Nevertheless, his love for music has never died. He applied to a special two-year music course in the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20National%20Music%20Academy\"&gt;Vietnam National Music Academy&lt;/a&gt;. There he proceeded to study &lt;a href=\"Vietnamese%20traditional%20music\"&gt;Vietnamese traditional music&lt;/a&gt;, majoring in Monochord Performance. Despite his illness, in 1997, Nguyen Thanh Tung continued to study Music composition and piano as well.\nThanh T\u00f9ng went through much hardship in his years at the Vietnam National Music Academy. He received great support from friends and professors such as Prof. &lt;a href=\"%C4%90%E1%BA%B7ng%20Xu%C3%A2n%20Kh%E1%BA%A3i\"&gt;\u0110\u1eb7ng Xu\u00e2n Kh\u1ea3i&lt;/a&gt;, music composer &lt;a href=\"%C4%90%E1%BB%97%20H%E1%BB%93ng%20Qu%C3%A2n\"&gt;\u0110\u1ed7 H\u1ed3ng Qu\u00e2n&lt;/a&gt;, Prof. &lt;a href=\"Minh%20Khang\"&gt;Minh Khang&lt;/a&gt;, etc. and many philanthropists\nPersonal life.\nNguy\u1ec5n Thanh T\u00f9ng's family plays an important part in his performance and composition career.\nThanh T\u00f9ng was born to Nguyen Thanh Son, a &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; veteran and currently a photographer, and Pham Thi Duc Hoa, a tailor.\nIn 1972, Mr.Son's squad was deployed in &lt;a href=\"Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Tr%E1%BB%8B\"&gt;Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb&lt;/a&gt; and he got affected by &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Orange\"&gt;Agent Orange&lt;/a&gt; ever since. His two children are inherently affected by the poisonous &lt;a href=\"dioxins%20and%20dioxin-like%20compounds\"&gt;dioxin&lt;/a&gt;. Thanh Tung's older sister, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thuy is more severely affected than him. She is totally paralyzed, epileptic, blind, deaf and dumb. After the end of the Vietnam War, Mr.Son has been working as a photographer to make ends meet. He is an example of determination and perseverance for his son, Thanh Tung.\nThanh T\u00f9ng's mother is a devoted and loving wife and mother. Her love and sacrifice for the family gives Thanh T\u00f9ng more strength to get over the difficulties and pursue his dream as a musician. The piece \"Moon and River\" was composed by Thanh T\u00f9ng to honor his mother, who has spent her whole life caring for him and his sister. In 2005, she received the &lt;a href=\"Sofia%20Kovalevskaya%20Award\"&gt;Sofia Kovalevskaya Award&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother important person behind the success of Thanh T\u00f9ng is his grandfather - Nguyen Te Do. He brought him up and introduced him to music. Finding his grandson interested in &lt;a href=\"monochord\"&gt;monochord&lt;/a&gt; melodies, but not affording a monochord at that time, he made a &lt;a href=\"monochord\"&gt;monochord&lt;/a&gt; for Thanh T\u00f9ng by himself. Simple as it is, this monochord is a part of Thanh T\u00f9ng's childhood and afterwards involves in his entire life and career.\nCareer.\nAn honor graduate, Thanh T\u00f9ng receives many invitations to perform in= and outside &lt;a href=\"Vietnam\"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;. Particularly, he had the chance to perform in the &lt;a href=\"2006%20APEC%20Summit\"&gt;2006 APEC Summit&lt;/a&gt; held in &lt;a href=\"Hanoi\"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2005, the organization \"Vietnam les enfants de la dioxin\" invited him to perform in France in a campaign for Agent Orange victims.\nThanh T\u00f9ng performed in several French cities, including &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marseille\"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt;, Roan, and then &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. He received standing ovations wherever he performed. The French media took notice of him. When he performed in a Christian church, people cried and said, \"Thank God for sending you here!\" \nIn Belgium, Thanh T\u00f9ng had the honor to perform with Prof. &lt;a href=\"Phi%20Deli\"&gt;Phi Deli&lt;/a&gt; of the Brussels Academy of Music. She let him sit in a higher place, claiming, \"I love Vietnam very much. You are a special musician from Vietnam, so I want everyone to see you more clearly and honor your will and determination.\"\nThanh T\u00f9ng usually performs three music genres, viz. Vietnamese folk music, monochord compositions by Vietnamese composers, and classical pieces by &lt;a href=\"Mozart\"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brahms\"&gt;Brahms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Schubert\"&gt;Schubert&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Beethoven\"&gt;Beethoven&lt;/a&gt; transcribed for the monochord.\nTo date, Nguy\u1ec5n Thanh T\u00f9ng continues to compose music, teach and perform the monochord, and mix music.\nMany documentary movies about his life and career have been shot, such as \"The little Taxaceae\" (1991), \"Overcome the Fate\" (2008), \"The message of hope and belief\" (2010) - one series of \"The Hanoians\", broadcast on the National Television of Vietnam, and so on.\nWorks.\nPerformance.\nNguy\u1ec5n Thanh T\u00f9ng performs successfully many of Vietnam's noted pieces such as Lullaby from South Vietnam, To the woods, Please stay, etc.\nThe song \"Hanoi's season without rain\" transcribed by Nguy\u1ec5n Thanh T\u00f9ng for piano solo became the theme song of the documentary movie \"Overcome the Fate\" about his life and career.\nComposition.\n\"Narrative\" (composed for violin) and \"Spring's color\" (for violin and piano) are some of Nguy\u1ec5n Thanh T\u00f9ng\u2019s\ncompositions.\n\"Moon and River\", composed for monochord, zither and percussion, won the Special Award in the Composition Competition held by the Vietnam National Music Academy. The piece was composed after a sleepless painful night of nostalgia. Thanh T\u00f9ng recalled his childhood days walking on the riverside with his grandfather in the moonlight. He thought his life was like a river, turning peaceful only after storms.\nStyle.\nThanh T\u00f9ng\u2019s monochord performances are purely moving, expressing love and his own difficult life experience. He enjoys improvising and usually improvises traditional melodies. However, he dislikes modern techniques applied to the monochord performance such as using the &lt;a href=\"Effects%20pedal\"&gt;pedal&lt;/a&gt; to move up or down several &lt;a href=\"octaves\"&gt;octaves&lt;/a&gt; currently popular with many Vietnamese musicians.\nThanh T\u00f9ng usually develops complex melodies in his composition where there is no leading instrument. This can be seen in his composition \"Moon and river.\" In general, Thanh T\u00f9ng\u2019s works are mixed between pure emotions and philosophy of life. The melodies are clearly contrasted with each other, resembling his struggle in music."
