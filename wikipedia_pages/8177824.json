He was selected in the first ever &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20Maroons\"&gt;Queensland Maroons&lt;/a&gt; state representative side to play the new &lt;a href=\"Rugby%20league\"&gt;\"Northern Union\" style of rugby&lt;/a&gt;, taking on &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Henry%20Baskerville\"&gt;Albert Baskerville's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;New Zealand All Golds&lt;/a&gt; on their &lt;a href=\"1907%E2%80%931908%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20tour%20of%20Australia%20and%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;inaugural tour&lt;/a&gt;. It would be his sole rugby league state appearance for &lt;a href=\"Queensland%20Maroons\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the New Zealand team came back on the return leg of their tour, they played three &lt;a href=\"Test%20match%20%28rugby%20league%29\"&gt;Test matches&lt;/a&gt; against the first &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20league%20team\"&gt;Australian representative&lt;/a&gt; sides ever selected.
