    "text": "Snipe Dales is a &lt;a href=\"country%20park\"&gt;country park&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Local%20Nature%20Reserve\"&gt;nature reserve&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Lincolnshire%20Wolds\"&gt;Lincolnshire Wolds&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Hagworthingham\"&gt;Hagworthingham&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lincolnshire\"&gt;Lincolnshire&lt;/a&gt;, England. The reserve is one of the few remaining examples showing the Wolds as they were.\nSnipe Dales comprises a raised heathland nature reserve at the west and a semi-natural mostly coniferous woodland country park at the east. It is located within a steep sided valley containing many small streams, sourced from springs, flowing into a larger stream that becomes a tributary of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Lymn\"&gt;River Lymn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe country park is in total of which 90 is woodland previously owned by the &lt;a href=\"Forestry%20Commission\"&gt;Forestry Commission&lt;/a&gt; and now by &lt;a href=\"Lincolnshire%20County%20Council\"&gt;Lincolnshire County Council&lt;/a&gt;. The nature reserve and park is jointly managed by the County Council and &lt;a href=\"Lincolnshire%20Wildlife%20Trust\"&gt;Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust&lt;/a&gt; with help from volunteers. Access is by foot or wheelchair only, although there is a car park with visitor facilities. Dogs are allowed on a short lead in the country park but not in the reserve.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Meridian\"&gt;Prime Meridian&lt;/a&gt; runs through Snipe Dales and a plaque is at its intersection."
