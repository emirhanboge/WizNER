    "text": "Kommunistka (in ) was a communist magazine from the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, associated to the &lt;a href=\"Zhenotdel\"&gt;Zhenotdel&lt;/a&gt;, founded by &lt;a href=\"Inessa%20Armand\"&gt;Inessa Armand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexandra%20Kollontai\"&gt;Alexandra Kollontai&lt;/a&gt; in 1920.\n\"Kommunistka\" was published on a monthly basis. The magazine was targeted specially to &lt;a href=\"Underclass\"&gt;lower class&lt;/a&gt; women, and explored the way to achieve &lt;a href=\"women%27s%20emancipation\"&gt;women's emancipation&lt;/a&gt;, not only in a theoretical manner, but practical, as the &lt;a href=\"russian%20revolution\"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt; by itself would not solve the women's &lt;a href=\"gender%20inequality\"&gt;inequality&lt;/a&gt; and oppression in the family and society. Armand and Kollontai insisted in the low percentage of women in the public sphere \u2013in the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt;, in business management, in the &lt;a href=\"soviet\"&gt;soviet&lt;/a&gt;s, in the &lt;a href=\"trade%20union\"&gt;trade union&lt;/a&gt;s or in the government\u2013 which would require a specific work for liberation.\nArmand, Kollontai or &lt;a href=\"Krupskaya\"&gt;Krupskaya&lt;/a&gt; addressed issues such as &lt;a href=\"sexuality\"&gt;sexuality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"abortion\"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;, marriage and &lt;a href=\"divorce\"&gt;divorce&lt;/a&gt;, the relationship between sexes, &lt;a href=\"free%20love\"&gt;free love&lt;/a&gt;, morality, family, motherhood or the liberation of women from the slavery of men. Furthermore, the magazine's perspective emphasized that women liberation was intimately linked to the emancipation of the whole &lt;a href=\"communist%20society\"&gt;communist society&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe magazine disappeared in 1930 together with the &lt;a href=\"Zhenotdel\"&gt;Zhenotdel&lt;/a&gt; itself under the &lt;a href=\"Stalinist\"&gt;Stalinist&lt;/a&gt; mandate."
