Couple Amanda Bartolome (&lt;a href=\"Vilma%20Santos\"&gt;Vilma Santos&lt;/a&gt;) and Juli\u00e1n Bartolome Sr. (&lt;a href=\"Christopher%20de%20Leon\"&gt;Christopher de Leon&lt;/a&gt;) are parents to sons Julian \"Jules\" Bartolome Jr. (&lt;a href=\"Piolo%20Pascual\"&gt;Piolo Pascual&lt;/a&gt;), Isagani \"Gani\" Bartolome (&lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Agassi\"&gt;Carlos Agassi&lt;/a&gt;), Emmanuel \"Em\" Bartolome (&lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Agustin\"&gt;Marvin Agustin&lt;/a&gt;), Jason Bartolome (&lt;a href=\"Danilo%20Barrios\"&gt;Danilo Barrios&lt;/a&gt;) and Benjamin \"Bingo\" Bartolome (&lt;a href=\"John%20Wayne%20Sace\"&gt;John Wayne Sace&lt;/a&gt;).\n1965-1970.\nIn 1965, as a young boy, Gani was fighting with his friend while they were playing a game in the street, their mothers came by to stop the fighting and made them stay away from each other. In the streets of Manila, protests take place when the Philippines enters the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;. Five years later, Philippine president &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Marcos\"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt; wins his re-election bid as president. Juli\u00e1n stops Amanda from looking for a job despite Amanda trying to pursue it. At dinner time, Jules and Gani speak about the upcoming &lt;a href=\"Prom\"&gt;Junior-Senior Promenade&lt;/a&gt;. At the prom, Gani tries to grope his partner but she kicks him instead. The Bartolomes get stuck in traffic in the streets on the way home from the event due to a protest with effigy burning taking place near the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Legislative%20Building%20%28Manila%29\"&gt;Legislative Building&lt;/a&gt;.\n1971.\nA protest takes place in the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;University of the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; wherein Jules with his best friend Willy (&lt;a href=\"Jhong%20Hilario\"&gt;Jhong Hilario&lt;/a&gt;) became activists and joined a resistance movement. At the same time, Emmanuel begins writing illegal exposure and other kinds of banned literature. During the protests, the attendees sing the Philippine National Anthem, \"&lt;a href=\"Lupang%20Hinirang\"&gt;Lupang Hinirang&lt;/a&gt;\", with raised clenched fists and outnumbered the authorities but their efforts to make the authorities leave become futile and they retreat. Juli\u00e1n becomes furious when he discovers their activities, and he angrily explains to Jules and Willy about the consequences of their actions, while also revealing the suspension of the &lt;a href=\"habeas%20corpus\"&gt;writ of habeas corpus&lt;/a&gt; including the enforced disappearance of the student leader Charlie del Rosario.\nGani reveals his plans to apply for a job in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;US Navy&lt;/a&gt; to Julian but is overheard by Jules, who admonishes his actions as a lack of patriotism for the Philippines. Gani furiously explains to him that working for the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;US government&lt;/a&gt; entitles one to a high salary with numerous benefits. Juli\u00e1n accepts the plan, thus making Gani the family's newest breadwinner. Sometime later, another protest depicts President &lt;a href=\"Ferdinand%20Marcos\"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt; acting as a lackey to &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Sam\"&gt;Uncle Sam&lt;/a&gt;, and crucifying a Filipino. Bingo pulls down a flying kite and Amanda discovers that the kite is made out of copies of the Communist newspaper &lt;a href=\"Ang%20Bayan\"&gt;Ang Bayan&lt;/a&gt;. Juli\u00e1n also discovers that Jules is an activist and he sneaks up to his room to check his rebellious pamphlets. He convinces that when Marcos was not yet a president in the past, the government signed a treaty between the United States, and the Philippines has no other choice but to recognize that treaty.\n1972.\nMarcos declares &lt;a href=\"martial%20law\"&gt;martial law&lt;/a&gt; on nationwide television, as well as imposing nighttime curfews in order to round up anyone suspected of being a terrorist or communist to be imprisoned. The change of events resulted in interrogations, tortures, and deaths. Gani accidentally impregnates his girlfriend Evelyn (&lt;a href=\"Dimples%20Romana\"&gt;Dimples Romana&lt;/a&gt;) and her sleeping in Gani's room was discovered by Amanda. Two police cars escort the Bartolomes to Evelyn's house. At the house, Evelyn's father speaks to the Bartolome couple before &lt;a href=\"Shotgun%20wedding\"&gt;blackmailing Gani into marrying her&lt;/a&gt;.\nDays after the wedding, they have an argument for being the Bartolome's figure of shame. Jason shows his mother the report card wherein his grades had lowered. But despite that, he convinces that during the first period, there was a high value of time. Jules came home late and confessed to his family that Willy had been tortured to death for staying past curfew. He later reveals his plan to travel to &lt;a href=\"Bicol%20Region\"&gt;Bicol&lt;/a&gt; for an exposure/field trip to join the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href=\"New%20People%27s%20Army\"&gt;NPA&lt;/a&gt; despite his mother's opposition.\n1973-1976.\nEvelyn gives birth to a baby girl wherein she and Gani stay together for a few days. Sometime later, Gani leaves for the United States via &lt;a href=\"Subic%20Bay\"&gt;Subic Bay&lt;/a&gt; after his enlisting at the US Navy while Evelyn returned to her family. Emmanuel plans to &lt;a href=\"Bataan\"&gt;Bataan&lt;/a&gt; for his research article writing and interview about the &lt;a href=\"Bataan%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant\"&gt;Bataan Nuclear Power Plant&lt;/a&gt; but Juli\u00e1n furiously opposes as the former is a possible target for roundup due to Martial Law and the presence of soldiers. However, Emmanuel continues his plan and leaves for Bataan the next day while the Bartolome family went to the beach two days later.\nJules brought a wounded friend home to have a bullet extracted from his leg, as bringing him to a hospital would arouse too much suspicion. A few days later, he began to hangout with Emmanuel but the following day, Jules left the house again realizing that he cannot stay there for long. Bingo celebrates his birthday with a party in the Bartolome household until night. After two months of not returning home, Jules was revealed to have been married to fellow NPA member Mara (&lt;a href=\"Ana%20Capri\"&gt;Ana Capri&lt;/a&gt;) with a baby boy. On one night, the family burns Jules' anti-government pamphlets out of fear of being arrested by authorities outside their house compound, who turn out to be a harmless group of carolers.\nA group of military men is raiding inside the room of the Bartolome family roaming around if there are subversive materials that are kept hidden. Luckily, the family never got arrested by the authorities. A call rang inside the room, Amanda answered the phone only to find out his son, Jules is imprisoned. \nAmanda and Julian visited Jules' prison where he recounted his experiences while in prison, where he experienced torture and solitary confinement. However, Amanda and Julian were proud of the bravery he went through. \nAt a Christmas party while Jules is still imprisoned, his family, including his parents and siblings along with his wife and son, has visited prison to meet him while his fellow inmates are singing Christmas songs. \nFinal years of the 70s.\nAmanda has been involved with a &lt;a href=\"non-government%20organization\"&gt;non-government organization&lt;/a&gt; (NGO) (similar to &lt;a href=\"Amnesty%20International\"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; or any other human rights groups) reaching out to families of victims who were being tortured at the hands of authorities, which she also handled these cases.\nBeing lost and confused waiting for his son, Jason to come home earlier, Amanda and Julian went out of the house to look for his son about his whereabouts, going inside different police station precincts searching and browsing through different logbooks looking for his son, but never found. Wearing a raincoat, Emmanuel also looked for his brother only to find out that Jason who was searching for by his mother was murdered and found lifeless inside the &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Zoo\"&gt;Manila Zoo&lt;/a&gt; compound with multiple stab wounds around the different parts of the body, as he only discovered his corpse in the unnamed morgue. Being drunk, Amanda berated Emmanuel on why he came home very late, few minutes or hours later, he approached Julian quietly going upstairs supposedly to talk about the bad news, however, a fight erupted between Emmanuel and Julian which Amanda and Bingo heard of, immediately went upstairs finding out, Julian attempts suicide and Amanda fainted instantly after she found out her son, Jason was murdered. At his brother's wake, handcuffed Jules went into tears as he met Jason only in his coffin, lifeless. \nBingo admitted that his late brother rebelled in his responsibilities as a brother. \nWhile doing something in the kitchen, Amanda and Julian went into a shouting match, blaming and questioning each other about their parental responsibility and failure to protect Jason's death. \nAmanda almost got separated from his husband packing clothes with herself, but interrupted only to find out the news Jules is finally released in the prison, while showing a short clip of &lt;a href=\"1978%20Philippine%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1978 Philippine parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; during noise barrage of supporters. \nDuring a family dinner, The family reunited, wherein Jules' wife and his son got reunited along with Evelyn. Jules announced to the family that he will be returning to the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20rebellion%20in%20the%20Philippines\"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;, which Julian accepted and wished him good luck in. Eventually, Amanda and Julian got emotional after they reconcile with each other. \nAt the end of the story, Amanda and his son Emmanuel participated in the Philippine National Anthem (by raising their clenched fists) in an auditorium for an activist play written by Emmanuel himself.\nEpilogue.\nIn 1983, the Bartolome family attend the wake of &lt;a href=\"Benigno%20Aquino%20Jr.\"&gt;Ninoy Aquino&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Santo%20Domingo%20Church\"&gt;Santo Domingo Church&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quezon%20City\"&gt;Quezon City&lt;/a&gt; after his &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20of%20Benigno%20Aquino%20Jr.\"&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt;. Amanda begins to join a large group of activists at the &lt;a href=\"Manila%20Central%20Post%20Office\"&gt;Post Office Building&lt;/a&gt; to overthrow the Marcos regime once and for all. The Marcos regime is peacefully overthrown in 1986 when &lt;a href=\"Corazon%20Aquino\"&gt;Corazon Aquino&lt;/a&gt; was sworn into office as president."
