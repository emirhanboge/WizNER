    "text": "The Leningradsky suburban railway line () is one of eleven railway lines used for suburban railway connections between &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, and surrounding areas in &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Oblast\"&gt;Moscow Oblast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tver%20Oblast\"&gt;Tver Oblast&lt;/a&gt;. The Leningradsky suburban railway line connects Moscow with the station in the northwest, in particular, with the towns of &lt;a href=\"Khimki\"&gt;Khimki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zelenograd\"&gt;Zelenograd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Solnechnogorsk\"&gt;Solnechnogorsk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Klin%2C%20Klinsky%20District%2C%20Moscow%20Oblast\"&gt;Klin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Konakovo\"&gt;Konakovo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tver\"&gt;Tver&lt;/a&gt;. The stations the direction serves are located in Moscow, in the towns of Khimki, Solnechnogorsk, and Klin in Moscow Oblast, and in &lt;a href=\"Konakovsky%20District\"&gt;Konakovsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalininsky%20District%2C%20Tver%20Oblast\"&gt;Kalininsky Districts&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Tver\"&gt;Tver&lt;/a&gt; of Tver Oblast. The suburban trains have their southeastern terminus at &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Leningradsky%20railway%20station\"&gt;Moscow Leningradsky railway station&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow. In the northwestern direction, the suburban trains terminate at &lt;a href=\"Kryukovo%20railway%20station\"&gt;Kryukovo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Podsolnechnaya%20railway%20station\"&gt;Podsolnechnaya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Klin%20railway%20station\"&gt;Klin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Konakovo%20GRES%20railway%20station\"&gt;Konakovo GRES&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tver%20railway%20station\"&gt;Tver&lt;/a&gt;. The line is served by &lt;a href=\"October%20Railway\"&gt;October Railway&lt;/a&gt;. This is in contrast to all other suburban directions from Moscow, which are served by &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Railway\"&gt;Moscow Railway&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe suburban railway line follows the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20%E2%80%93%20Saint%20Petersburg%20Railway\"&gt;Moscow \u2013 Saint Petersburg Railway&lt;/a&gt; which connects Moscow with &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; via Tver and &lt;a href=\"Bologoye\"&gt;Bologoye&lt;/a&gt;. It is electrified everywhere between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.\nHistory.\nThe railway between Moscow and Saint Petersburg was opened on November\u00a01, 1851 and is the second oldest railway in Russia. In 1950, it was electrified between Moscow and Kryukovo, and in 1953, between Kryukovo and Klin. In 1957, the section between Klin and Kalinin (currently Tver) was electrified. In 1966, a branch to Konakovo was electrified as well.\nIn 1914, a railway connecting Klin and &lt;a href=\"Vysokovsk\"&gt;Vysokovsk&lt;/a&gt; was open. There was passenger traffic between Klin and Vysokovsk. The section was never electrified, and the passenger traffic was discontinued in the 1970s. In 2018, the line was demolished, since it was crossed by the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%E2%80%93Saint%20Petersburg%20motorway\"&gt;M11 highway&lt;/a&gt;, and no bridge or tunnel was included to the construction project.\nStations.\nFollowing the standard notations in Russia, a railway stop below is called a station if it is a terminus or if it has a cargo terminal, and it is called a platform (railway stop) otherwise."
