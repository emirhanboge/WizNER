    "text": "Greenpeace East Asia is an office serving the East Asia region of the global &lt;a href=\"environmental%20organization\"&gt;environmental organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Greenpeace\"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the largest international &lt;a href=\"NGOs%20in%20China\"&gt;NGOs in China&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nGreenpeace East Asia's first &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; office was opened in &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong\"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; in 1997. Early actions included a blockade of a &lt;a href=\"shipment\"&gt;shipment&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"electronic%20waste\"&gt;electronic waste&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and a campaign highlighting the dangers of &lt;a href=\"PVC\"&gt;PVC&lt;/a&gt; in children's &lt;a href=\"toy\"&gt;toy&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBefore offices were formally opened in &lt;a href=\"Guangzhou\"&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beijing\"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, activists from the Hong Kong office ran several campaigns on the Chinese Mainland. These included investigations into electronic waste dumping in &lt;a href=\"Guangdong\"&gt;Guangdong province&lt;/a&gt; and a campaign to stop US-headquartered biotechnology firm &lt;a href=\"Monsanto%20Company\"&gt;Monsanto Company&lt;/a&gt; from patenting a Chinese indigenous &lt;a href=\"soy%20bean\"&gt;soy bean&lt;/a&gt; variety.\nEarly &lt;a href=\"mainland%20China\"&gt;mainland-based&lt;/a&gt; campaigns focused on food and agriculture and electronic waste. Since then Greenpeace East Asia has broadened its mandate into efforts to urge China's &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; products industry to import environmentally sound &lt;a href=\"timber\"&gt;timber&lt;/a&gt;, clean up its polluted &lt;a href=\"Rivers%20in%20China\"&gt;rivers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lakes%20in%20China\"&gt;lakes&lt;/a&gt;, and highlight the urgency of stopping &lt;a href=\"climate%20change\"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;.\nCampaigns.\nGreenpeace East Asia runs five main campaigns: &lt;a href=\"climate%20and%20energy\"&gt;climate and energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agriculture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"toxic\"&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"water%20pollution\"&gt;water pollution&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s and a campaign on &lt;a href=\"air%20pollution\"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt;. The organisation uses non-violent direct action to draw attention to what it considers significant threats to the environment and also lobbies for solutions. It emphasizes that while \"surging economic development in East Asia has brought widespread prosperity, [it] has also taken a severe environmental toll, both regionally and worldwide.\"\nThe website also lists several achievements including:\nCurrently one of Greenpeace East Asia's key campaigns is to encourage China to reduce its reliance on &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; as a power source and to speed up the development of the &lt;a href=\"renewable%20energy\"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; sector instead.\nApart from specific campaigns, they also work with local organisations from time to time for general advocacy, including with the Geography Society of &lt;a href=\"PLK%20Vicwood%20KT%20Chong%20Sixth%20Form%20College\"&gt;PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College&lt;/a&gt; between 2008 and 2009.\nResearch reports.\nIn June 2021, it released \"Missing Brownfields- Hong Kong Brownfields Report 2021\", a collaborative report with &lt;a href=\"Liber%20Research%20Community\"&gt;Liber Research Community&lt;/a&gt; where together, they found a total of 1,950 hectares of &lt;a href=\"Brownfield%20land\"&gt;brownfield&lt;/a&gt; sites, 379 more hectares than the government was previously able to locate."
