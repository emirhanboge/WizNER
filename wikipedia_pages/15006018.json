    "text": " is the traditional name carried by the head of the &lt;a href=\"Urasenke\"&gt;Urasenke&lt;/a&gt; family. Sen is the family name and S\u014dshitsu is the hereditary name assumed by the successor upon becoming \"&lt;a href=\"iemoto\"&gt;iemoto&lt;/a&gt;\" of Urasenke. The first person in this line of the Sen family to use the name S\u014dshitsu was the youngest son of &lt;a href=\"Sen%20no%20S%C5%8Dtan\"&gt;Sen no S\u014dtan&lt;/a&gt;; in other words, a great-grandson of &lt;a href=\"Sen%20no%20Riky%C5%AB\"&gt;Sen no Riky\u016b&lt;/a&gt;. He is generally known as Sens\u014d S\u014dshitsu (\u4ed9\u53df\u5b97\u5ba4), without mention of the family name, and is counted as the fourth generation in the Urasenke family line. The current head of Urasenke is the sixteenth generation, Sen S\u014dshitsu XVI, who is distinguished by his cognomen, Zab\u014dsai.\nThe &lt;a href=\"kanji\"&gt;kanji&lt;/a&gt; character for \"s\u014d\", \u5b97, in the hereditary name may be interpreted to mean \"family core\". Like the head of Urasenke, the heads of other &lt;a href=\"schools%20of%20Japanese%20tea%20ceremony\"&gt;schools of Japanese tea ceremony&lt;/a&gt; also have hereditary names beginning with this kanji character. For example, the head of the &lt;a href=\"Omotesenke\"&gt;Omotesenke&lt;/a&gt; school traditionally carries the name S\u014dsa, written \u5b97\u5de6, and the head of the &lt;a href=\"Mushak%C5%8Djisenke\"&gt;Mushak\u014djisenke&lt;/a&gt; school is S\u014dshu, \u5b97\u5b88."
