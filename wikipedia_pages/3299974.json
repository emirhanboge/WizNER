    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Italian%20scudo\"&gt;scudo&lt;/a&gt; (plural \"scudi\") is the official currency of the &lt;a href=\"Sovereign%20Military%20Order%20of%20Malta\"&gt;Sovereign Military Order of Malta&lt;/a&gt; and was the currency of &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt; during the rule of the Order over Malta, which ended in 1798. It is subdivided into 12 \"tar\u00ec\" (singular \"tar\u00ec\"), each of 20 \"grani\" (singular \"grano\") with 6 \"piccoli\" (singular \"piccolo\") to the grano. It is pegged to the &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; (at a rate of 1 scudo to \u20ac0.24, which translates to \u20ac1 = 4 scudi 2 tar\u00ec).\nHistory.\nThe scudo was first minted in &lt;a href=\"Rhodes\"&gt;Rhodes&lt;/a&gt; in 1318. By 1500 the coins had the distinctive characteristics of a cross and the Order's and Grandmaster's coat of arms on one side, and the &lt;a href=\"Beheading%20of%20St.%20John%20the%20Baptist\"&gt;head of St. John the Baptist&lt;/a&gt; on the other. The scudo was first minted in Malta during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Piero%20de%20Ponte\"&gt;Piero de Ponte&lt;/a&gt;. The quality of the coins improved especially during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Ant%C3%B3nio%20Manoel%20de%20Vilhena\"&gt;Ant\u00f3nio Manoel de Vilhena&lt;/a&gt; in the early 18th century. At some points in time, foreign coinage was allowed to circulate in Malta alongside the scudo. These included &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20dollar\"&gt;Spanish dollar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Venetian%20lira\"&gt;Venetian lire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Louis%20d%27or\"&gt;Louis d'or&lt;/a&gt; and other currencies.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"French%20occupation%20of%20Malta\"&gt;French occupation of Malta&lt;/a&gt; in 1798, the French authorities melted down some of the silver from the island's churches and struck them into 15 and 30 tar\u00ec coins from the 1798 dies of Grandmaster Hompesch. After the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Malta%20%281798%E2%80%931800%29\"&gt;Maltese rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, gold and silver ingots were stamped with a face value in grani, tar\u00ec and scudi and they briefly circulated as coinage in &lt;a href=\"Valletta\"&gt;Valletta&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding area.\nThe scudo continued to circulate on the island of Malta, which had become a &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Colony%20of%20Malta\"&gt;British colony&lt;/a&gt;, along with some other currencies until they were all replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Maltese%20pound%23Pound\"&gt;pound&lt;/a&gt; in 1825, at a rate of 1 pound to 12 scudi using &lt;a href=\"Coins%20of%20the%20pound%20sterling%23Pre-decimal%20coinage\"&gt;British coinage&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, some scudi remained in use and the last coins were withdrawn from circulation and demonetized in November 1886. 1 scudo in 1886 had the spending power equivalent to \u00a33.82 or \u20ac4.35 in 2011. The present-day &lt;a href=\"Malta\"&gt;Republic of Malta&lt;/a&gt; adopted the &lt;a href=\"decimalization\"&gt;decimal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maltese%20lira\"&gt;Maltese lira&lt;/a&gt; in 1972, and the &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; in 2008.\nThe SMOM, which is now based in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, has issued souvenir coins denominated in grani, tar\u00ec and scudi since 1961. The 1961 issues were minted in &lt;a href=\"Rome\"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, while mints in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arezzo\"&gt;Arezzo&lt;/a&gt; were used in 1962 and 1963. From 1964 onwards coins were minted in the Order's own mint.\nThe scudo was also the currency used on the &lt;a href=\"Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20the%20Sovereign%20Military%20Order%20of%20Malta\"&gt;Order's stamps&lt;/a&gt; from 1961 to 2005, when the euro began to be used.\nCoins.\nCoins were issued in denominations of 1, , 5 and 10 grani, 1, 2, 4 and 6 tar\u00ec, 1, , , 2, , 5, 10 and 20 scudi. The 1, , 5 and 10 grani and 1 tar\u00ec were minted in copper, with the grani denominated as 15 piccoli. The 2, 4 and 6 tar\u00ec, 1, , , 2 and scudi were silver coins, with the , and scudi denominated as 15, 16 and 30 tar\u00ec. The 5, 10, 20 scudi coins were gold.\nCoins minted today include bronze 10 grani, silver 9 tar\u00ec, 1 and 2 scudi and gold 5 and 10 scudi.\nIn 2011, a gold coin of &lt;a href=\"Ant%C3%B3nio%20Manoel%20de%20Vilhena\"&gt;Ant\u00f3nio Manoel de Vilhena&lt;/a&gt; minted in 1725 sold for &lt;a href=\"US%24\"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;340,000."
