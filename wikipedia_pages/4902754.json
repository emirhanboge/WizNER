    "text": "Power Piggs of the Dark Age is a 2D &lt;a href=\"platform%20game\"&gt;platform game&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System\"&gt;Super NES&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Sega%20Mega%20Drive\"&gt;Sega Mega Drive&lt;/a&gt; version was planned but never released.\nGameplay.\nThe video game takes place during the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29\"&gt;Dark Ages&lt;/a&gt;. In control of a group of humanoid &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s, the player's object is to defeat a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; named the Wizard of Wolff; a humanoid &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; with strange magical powers. Each of the \"Power Piggs\" was planned to use their own &lt;a href=\"medieval\"&gt;medieval&lt;/a&gt; weapon and uses it to defeat minor enemies that lie in his path. However, the actual released version of the game featured only one playable character, Bruno, in spite of all three still appearing on the title screen.\nThe first stage is a typical medieval town but it only gets more surreal from there.\n&lt;a href=\"Doughnut\"&gt;Doughnut&lt;/a&gt;s are seen as food in the game for the main characters. One of the main characters is a knight named Bruno; his secondary weapon happens to be pastries that explode on contact with the enemy.\nSeveral in-game passwords help to reveal a mini-game in addition to hidden messages within the coding of the game itself.\nReception.\nDoctor Devon of \"&lt;a href=\"GamePro\"&gt;GamePro&lt;/a&gt;\" praised the player character's move set, the cartoon-style graphics, the humorous sound effects, and the fast-paced music, though he acknowledged that \"Power Piggs of the Dark Age\" lacks the sophistication of some of the more recent platform games.\n&lt;a href=\"Allgame\"&gt;Allgame&lt;/a&gt; gave the game a score of 3 stars out of a possible 5, with the reviewer offering some praise for the game's graphics."
