    "text": "Christian Gottlieb Hilt (29 January 1888 \u2013 5 August 1958) was a &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; newspaper editor and politician for the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20Labour%20Party\"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Norway\"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; parties.\nHilt was born in &lt;a href=\"Bergen\"&gt;Bergen&lt;/a&gt;, and started studies in 1906 but left the higher education system after a couple of years. He instead became subeditor in the newspaper \"&lt;a href=\"Demokraten\"&gt;Smaalenenes Social-Demokrat&lt;/a&gt;\", and was acting editor-in-chief from 1910 to 1911. Hilt then worked in \"&lt;a href=\"Rogalands%20Avis\"&gt;Den 1ste Mai&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Bratsberg-Demokraten\"&gt;Bratsberg-Demokraten&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Dagsavisen\"&gt;Social-Demokraten&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1914, he was hired in \"&lt;a href=\"Fremtiden\"&gt;Fremtiden&lt;/a&gt;\", where he was promoted to subeditor in October, and in 1916 he was hired in \"&lt;a href=\"Ny%20Tid%20%28Trondheim%29\"&gt;Ny Tid&lt;/a&gt;\" where he became editor in 1918. Already in 1919, Hilt left \"Ny Tid\" to become a manager in the news bureau &lt;a href=\"Avisenes%20nyhetsbyr%C3%A5\"&gt;Arbeidernes Pressekontor&lt;/a&gt;. He was also a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20delegates%20of%20the%204th%20Comintern%20congress\"&gt;delegate&lt;/a&gt; at the Fourth &lt;a href=\"Comintern\"&gt;Comintern&lt;/a&gt; Congress in 1922, and participated in the &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20International%23World%20Congresses%20of%20the%20Comintern%20and%20Plenums%20of%20ECCI\"&gt;4th and 7th Enlarged Plenums&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Executive%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20International\"&gt;Executive Committee of the Comintern&lt;/a&gt; in 1926 and 1927.\nIn 1923, Hilt broke away from the Labour Party, joining the Communist Party. He was elected party secretary in 1925, and was a politburo member from 1926 to 1929. He had two spells as editor-in-chief for \"&lt;a href=\"Norges%20Kommunistblad\"&gt;Norges Kommunistblad&lt;/a&gt;\", from July 1926 to the spring of 1927 and from the autumn 1927 to 1929. The hiatus came because Hilt stayed in the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; for a period. Around 1926\u20131927, he also served on the editorial board of \"&lt;a href=\"Proletaren\"&gt;Proletaren&lt;/a&gt;\". Hilt then stayed in the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1936, where he did various work for Comintern, and was a correspondent for newspapers all over &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1937, Hilt returned to Norway as secretary of a Norway\u2013Soviet friendship association. He also edited a communist periodical \"Nytt Land\" from 1937 to 1940.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"occupation%20of%20Norway%20by%20Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;, Hilt was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Norwegian%20resistance%20movement\"&gt;Norwegian resistance movement&lt;/a&gt;. He was described by &lt;a href=\"Heinrich%20Fehlis\"&gt;Heinrich Fehlis&lt;/a&gt; in an August 1940 edition of \"&lt;a href=\"Meldungen%20aus%20Norwegen\"&gt;Meldungen aus Norwegen&lt;/a&gt;\". When the &lt;a href=\"Underground%20media%20in%20German-occupied%20Europe\"&gt;illegal newspaper&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Friheten\"&gt;Friheten&lt;/a&gt;\" started in 1941, Hilt edited it together with &lt;a href=\"Erling%20Heiestad\"&gt;Erling Heiestad&lt;/a&gt;. The newspaper was &lt;a href=\"stencil\"&gt;stencil&lt;/a&gt;ed, and published fortnightly. Hilt also edited \"Radio-Nytt\". While Heiestad was arrested in 1941, Hilt made good his escape to &lt;a href=\"Sweden%20during%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;neutral Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the war, Hilt was again secretary of a new Norway\u2013Soviet friendship association. He died in August 1958, and is buried at \u00d8stre Aker."
