    "text": "Lochee United Football Club are a Scottish &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; club based in the &lt;a href=\"Lochee\"&gt;Lochee&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href=\"Dundee\"&gt;Dundee&lt;/a&gt;. Formed in 1892, they currently compete in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20East%20Region%20Super%20League\"&gt;SJFA East Super League North&lt;/a&gt; and play their home games at Thomson Park.\nHistory.\nAfter spending their early years as a juvenile and amateur side, United joined the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20Association\"&gt;Junior&lt;/a&gt; grade in 1959. Their Thomson Park ground was opened by former &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; captain &lt;a href=\"George%20Young%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29\"&gt;George Young&lt;/a&gt; in the same year.\nAchieving notable local success in the late 1970s and 1980s, the club flourished again after the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20East%20Region%20Super%20League\"&gt;East Region Superleague&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. Under the management of &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Wolecki%20Black\"&gt;Eddie Wolecki Black&lt;/a&gt;, United were promoted as Tayside Premier champions in 2003 and two seasons later, won their first Superleague title. In the same year, they also reached the final of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the first, and so far, only time, losing 2\u20130 to local rivals &lt;a href=\"Tayport%20F.C.\"&gt;Tayport&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tannadice%20Park\"&gt;Tannadice Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nWolecki departed for &lt;a href=\"Montrose%20F.C.\"&gt;Montrose&lt;/a&gt; in December 2005 but his successor as manager, former &lt;a href=\"Dundee%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Dundee United&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"midfielder\"&gt;midfielder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ray%20McKinnon%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Ray McKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, maintained the clubs' run of success, culminating in a second East Superleague title in 2007\u201308. This led to their participation in the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. United reached the third round of the competition after beating fellow Junior qualifier &lt;a href=\"Bathgate%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Bathgate Thistle&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131 in the first round and Highland League side &lt;a href=\"Buckie%20Thistle%20F.C.\"&gt;Buckie Thistle&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20130 in the second round. In the third round, Lochee held &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ayr%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Ayr United&lt;/a&gt; to a 1\u20131 draw at home before going down 3\u20131 in the replay at &lt;a href=\"Somerset%20Park\"&gt;Somerset Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are one of two Junior clubs from Lochee, the other being &lt;a href=\"Lochee%20Harp%20F.C.\"&gt;Lochee Harp&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe team has been managed since July 2016 by George Shields.\nLochee won their third East Superleague title in &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20East%20Super%20League\"&gt;2018\u201319&lt;/a&gt;, making them eligible to enter the &lt;a href=\"2019%E2%80%9320%20Scottish%20Cup\"&gt;2019\u201320 Scottish Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the Preliminary round stage.\nHonours.\n&lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Cup\"&gt;Scottish Junior Cup&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Junior%20Football%20East%20Region%20Super%20League\"&gt;SJFA East Region Super League&lt;/a&gt;"
