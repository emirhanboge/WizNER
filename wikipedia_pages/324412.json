    "title": "Chromic acid",
    "text": "The term chromic acid is usually used for a mixture made by adding concentrated &lt;a href=\"sulfuric%20acid\"&gt;sulfuric acid&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Chromate%20and%20dichromate\"&gt;dichromate&lt;/a&gt;, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid &lt;a href=\"chromium%20trioxide\"&gt;chromium trioxide&lt;/a&gt;. This kind of chromic acid may be used as a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, H2CrO4 of which the trioxide is the &lt;a href=\"Acidic%20oxide\"&gt;anhydride&lt;/a&gt;. Chromic acid features chromium in an &lt;a href=\"oxidation%20state\"&gt;oxidation state&lt;/a&gt; of +6 (or VI). It is a strong and corrosive &lt;a href=\"oxidising%20agent\"&gt;oxidising agent&lt;/a&gt;.\nMolecular chromic acid.\nMolecular chromic acid, H2CrO4, has much in common with &lt;a href=\"sulfuric%20acid\"&gt;sulfuric acid&lt;/a&gt;, H2SO4. Only sulfuric acid can be classified as part of the 7 &lt;a href=\"strong%20acid\"&gt;strong acid&lt;/a&gt;s list. Due to the laws pertinent to the concept of \"first order ionization energy\", the first proton is lost most easily. It behaves extremely similar to sulfuric acid deprotonation. Since the process of polyvalent acid-base titrations have more than one proton (especially when the acid is starting substance and the base is the titrant), protons can only leave an acid one at a time. Hence the first step is as follows: \nThe &lt;a href=\"acid%20dissociation%20constant\"&gt;p\"K\"a&lt;/a&gt; for the equilibrium is not well characterized. Reported values vary between about \u22120.8 to 1.6. The value at zero &lt;a href=\"ionic%20strength\"&gt;ionic strength&lt;/a&gt; is difficult to determine because half dissociation only occurs in very acidic &lt;a href=\"Solution%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;, at about pH\u00a00, that is, with an acid concentration of about 1\u00a0mol\u00a0dm\u22123. A further complication is that the ion [HCrO4]\u2212 has a marked tendency to dimerize, with the loss of a water molecule, to form the dichromate ion, [Cr2O7]2\u2212:\nFurthermore, the dichromate can be protonated:\nThe p\"K\" value for this reaction shows that it can be ignored at pH\u00a0&gt;\u00a04.\nLoss of the second proton occurs in the pH range 4\u20138, making the ion [HCrO4]\u2212 a &lt;a href=\"weak%20acid\"&gt;weak acid&lt;/a&gt;.\nMolecular chromic acid could in principle be made by adding chromium trioxide to water (\"cf.\" &lt;a href=\"contact%20process\"&gt;manufacture of sulfuric acid&lt;/a&gt;).\nbut in practice the reverse reaction occurs when molecular chromic acid is &lt;a href=\"Dehydration%20reaction\"&gt;dehydrated&lt;/a&gt;. This is what happens when concentrated sulfuric acid is added to a dichromate solution. At first the colour changes from orange (dichromate) to red (chromic acid) and then deep red crystals of chromium trioxide precipitate from the mixture, without further colour change. The colours are due to &lt;a href=\"Charge-transfer%20complex\"&gt;LMCT&lt;/a&gt; transitions.\nChromium trioxide is the &lt;a href=\"Acidic%20oxide\"&gt;anhydride&lt;/a&gt; of molecular chromic acid. It is a &lt;a href=\"Lewis%20acid\"&gt;Lewis acid&lt;/a&gt; and can react with a Lewis base, such as &lt;a href=\"pyridine\"&gt;pyridine&lt;/a&gt; in a non-aqueous medium such as &lt;a href=\"dichloromethane\"&gt;dichloromethane&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Collins%20reagent\"&gt;Collins reagent&lt;/a&gt;).\nDichromic acid.\nDichromic acid, H2Cr2O7 is the fully protonated form of the dichromate ion and also can be seen as the product of adding chromium trioxide to molecular chromic acid. Dichromic acid will behave the same exact way when reacting with a primary or secondary alcohol. The caveat to this statement is that a secondary alcohol will be oxidized no further than a ketone, whereas a primary alcohol will be oxidized to a aldehyde for the first step of the mechanism and then oxidized again to a carboxylic acid, contingent on no significant steric hindrance impeding this reaction. \nDichromic acid undergoes the following reaction: \nIt is probably present in chromic acid cleaning mixtures along with the mixed chromosulfuric acid H2CrSO7.\nUses.\nChromic acid is an intermediate in chromium plating, and is also used in ceramic glazes, and colored glass. Because a solution of chromic acid in sulfuric acid (also known as a sulfochromic mixture or chromosulfuric acid) is a powerful &lt;a href=\"oxidizing%20agent\"&gt;oxidizing agent&lt;/a&gt;, it can be used to &lt;a href=\"Tube%20cleaning\"&gt;clean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"laboratory%20glassware\"&gt;laboratory glassware&lt;/a&gt;, particularly of otherwise insoluble organic residues. This application has declined due to environmental concerns. Furthermore, the acid leaves trace amounts of &lt;a href=\"paramagnetic\"&gt;paramagnetic&lt;/a&gt; chromic ions \u2014 Cr(III) \u2014 that can interfere with certain applications, such as &lt;a href=\"NMR%20spectroscopy\"&gt;NMR spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially the case for &lt;a href=\"NMR%20tubes\"&gt;NMR tubes&lt;/a&gt;.\nChromic acid was widely used in the musical instrument repair industry, due to its ability to \"brighten\" raw &lt;a href=\"brass\"&gt;brass&lt;/a&gt;. A chromic acid dip leaves behind a bright yellow &lt;a href=\"patina\"&gt;patina&lt;/a&gt; on the brass. Due to growing health and environmental concerns, many have discontinued use of this chemical in their repair shops.\nIt was used in &lt;a href=\"hair%20dye\"&gt;hair dye&lt;/a&gt; in the 1940s, under the name \"Melereon\".\nIt is used as a bleach in black and white photographic reversal processing.\nReactions.\nChromic acid is capable of oxidizing many kinds of &lt;a href=\"organic%20compound\"&gt;organic compound&lt;/a&gt;s and many variations on this reagent have been developed:\nUse in qualitative organic analysis.\nIn &lt;a href=\"organic%20chemistry\"&gt;organic chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, dilute solutions of chromic acid can be used to oxidize primary or secondary &lt;a href=\"Alcohol%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;s to the corresponding &lt;a href=\"aldehyde\"&gt;aldehyde&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ketone\"&gt;ketone&lt;/a&gt;s. Similarly, it can also be used to oxidize an aldehyde to its corresponding &lt;a href=\"carboxylic%20acid\"&gt;carboxylic acid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tertiary%20alcohol\"&gt;Tertiary alcohol&lt;/a&gt;s and ketones are unaffected. Because the &lt;a href=\"oxidation\"&gt;oxidation&lt;/a&gt; is signaled by a color change from orange to brownish green (indicating chromium being reduced from oxidation state +6 to +3), chromic acid is commonly used as a lab reagent in high school or undergraduate college chemstry as a qualitative analytical test for the presence of primary or &lt;a href=\"secondary%20alcohol\"&gt;secondary alcohol&lt;/a&gt;s, or aldehydes.\nAlternative reagents.\nIn oxidations of &lt;a href=\"Alcohol%20%28chemistry%29\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"aldehyde\"&gt;aldehyde&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"carboxylic%20acid\"&gt;carboxylic acid&lt;/a&gt;s, chromic acid is one of several reagents, including several that are catalytic. For example, nickel(II) salts catalyze oxidations by &lt;a href=\"Sodium%20hypochlorite\"&gt;bleach&lt;/a&gt; (hypochlorite). Aldehydes are relatively easily oxidised to carboxylic acids, and mild &lt;a href=\"oxidant\"&gt;oxidising agents&lt;/a&gt; are sufficient. Silver(I) compounds have been used for this purpose. Each oxidant offers advantages and disadvantages. Instead of using chemical oxidants, electrochemical oxidation is often possible.\nSafety.\n&lt;a href=\"Hexavalent%20chromium\"&gt;Hexavalent chromium&lt;/a&gt; compounds (including chromium trioxide, chromic acids, chromates, chlorochromates) are &lt;a href=\"toxic\"&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carcinogenic\"&gt;carcinogenic&lt;/a&gt;. For this reason, chromic acid oxidation is not used on an industrial scale except in the &lt;a href=\"aerospace\"&gt;aerospace&lt;/a&gt; industry.\nChromium trioxide and chromic acids are strong oxidisers and may react violently if mixed with easily oxidisable organic substances. Fires or explosions may result.\nChromic acid &lt;a href=\"chemical%20burn\"&gt;burns&lt;/a&gt; are treated with a dilute &lt;a href=\"sodium%20thiosulfate\"&gt;sodium thiosulfate&lt;/a&gt; solution."
