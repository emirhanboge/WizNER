    "text": "Anarchism in Belgium began to spread after the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Commune\"&gt;Paris Commune&lt;/a&gt;, when many Communards, including &lt;a href=\"%C3%89lis%C3%A9e%20Reclus\"&gt;\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus&lt;/a&gt;, took refuge in &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the Belgian &lt;a href=\"C%C3%A9sar%20de%20Paepe\"&gt;C\u00e9sar de Paepe&lt;/a&gt; defended a &lt;a href=\"Mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29\"&gt;mutualism&lt;/a&gt; inspired by &lt;a href=\"Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon\"&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&lt;/a&gt;, which proposed to organize production and distribution by relying on independent workers' associations without the intermediary of the State.\nDuring the conflict between the \"internationalists\" close to &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Bakunin\"&gt;Mikhail Bakunin&lt;/a&gt; and the General Council of London dominated by &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Marx\"&gt;Karl Marx&lt;/a&gt;, the Belgian section supported the anti-authoritarian tendency gathered around the &lt;a href=\"Jura%20Federation\"&gt;Jura Federation&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"congress%20of%20Saint-Imier\"&gt;congress of Saint-Imier&lt;/a&gt; (1872). The anti-authoritarian International held a congress in &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; in 1874. The 1877 Congress of the International held in &lt;a href=\"Verviers\"&gt;Verviers&lt;/a&gt; failed to find an understanding with the &lt;a href=\"Marxist\"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Socialist\"&gt;Socialist&lt;/a&gt; delegates who met a few days later in &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;, during the Universal Socialist Congress. But the delegates of the Verviers congress are in the minority. The Belgian federation and the Flemish sections subsequently left the International, to rally behind Marxism.\nSubsequently, anarchism lost influence among the workers' movement in Belgium, and particularly in &lt;a href=\"Flanders\"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt;. More and more workers' organizations turned to the political and electoral process for social laws.\nHistory.\nFrom the origins to 1880.\nThe Anti-Authoritarian International.\nIn September 1872, during the &lt;a href=\"Hague%20Congress%20%281872%29\"&gt;Hague Congress&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Workingmen%27s%20Association\"&gt;International Workingmen's Association&lt;/a&gt;, the Belgian delegates spoke out against the exclusion of &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Bakunin\"&gt;Mikhail Bakunin&lt;/a&gt; proposed by the General Council of London, dominated by &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Marx\"&gt;Karl Marx&lt;/a&gt;. In this founding conflict of anarchism, they joined the camp of the \"&lt;a href=\"anti-authoritarians\"&gt;anti-authoritarians&lt;/a&gt;\" against the \"&lt;a href=\"authoritarians\"&gt;authoritarians&lt;/a&gt;\". Like Bakunin, the Belgian delegates refused to achieve their objectives by conquering political power and were in favor of a federalist structure of the International, in which the local groups retained a large degree of autonomy. According to them, the revolution would take place quickly and a new society would be built from below.\nFrom this split was born, at the congress of Saint-Imier on 15 September 1872, an \"anti-authoritarian\" International known as the &lt;a href=\"Jura%20Federation\"&gt;Jura Federation&lt;/a&gt;. It was around this that the anarchist current was born, which then claimed to be called \"&lt;a href=\"revolutionary%20collectivism\"&gt;revolutionary collectivism&lt;/a&gt;\", wanting to be the promoter of a &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20self-management\"&gt;self-managed&lt;/a&gt; economic system outside all &lt;a href=\"authority\"&gt;authority&lt;/a&gt;, all &lt;a href=\"centralization\"&gt;centralization&lt;/a&gt;, all &lt;a href=\"State%20%28polity%29\"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; and giving as objective \"the destruction of all political power by the &lt;a href=\"revolutionary%20strike\"&gt;revolutionary strike&lt;/a&gt;\". The majority of Belgian members of the First International joined this anti-authoritarian International.\nIn the mid-1870s, Belgian socialism was made up of a set of workers' associations anxious to maintain their independence and to stay away from politics. The local federation of &lt;a href=\"Verviers\"&gt;Verviers&lt;/a&gt; was then the center of the anti-authoritarian International in Belgium. It challenged trade unionism and political action to privilege revolutionary propaganda: the abolition of the state must be the top priority. But the announced revolution was long overdue and the &lt;a href=\"social-democratic\"&gt;social-democratic&lt;/a&gt; tendency, particularly present in &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;, gradually won out over the anti-political revolutionary.\n\"Compagnon\".\nThe term \"companion\" by which anarchists refer to themselves was first used in Belgium, said &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Maitron\"&gt;Jean Maitron&lt;/a&gt;, who quoted a letter from &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Robin\"&gt;Paul Robin&lt;/a&gt;: \"We say companion, in Belgium it is even less a man of the world than citizen\". Maitron's research clearly shows the particular tone of this term. \"When the &lt;a href=\"Republicanism\"&gt;republicans&lt;/a&gt;,\" cried T\u00e9venin, judged before the Assize Court of Is\u00e8re, \"wanted to designate themselves separately from the &lt;a href=\"monarchists\"&gt;monarchists&lt;/a&gt;, they took the name of citizen; we who despise the right of &lt;a href=\"citizenship\"&gt;citizenship&lt;/a&gt;, we looked for an absolutely working-class term and we adopted that of companion; that means a companion in struggle, in misery, sometimes also in a chain\". &lt;a href=\"James%20Guillaume\"&gt;James Guillaume&lt;/a&gt; wrote in 1905 \"For workers, the quality of producer takes precedence over the quality of citizen; that is why the members of the international called each other companions and not citizens\". These companions do not belong to a party, but to local groups without structures and living an independent life. The group is for them a simple educational school, \"there is neither office nor cash, each one is independent. The members take care of being themselves, then develop, learn; one discusses in order to know what is good and what is bad and each one acts according to the faculties which his temperament allows him. No one is told to do this or do that, and you should never do that, but this is right, this is wrong, this is the right thing to do.\"\nFrom 1880 to 1914.\nWalloon uprising of 1886.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20strike%20of%201886\"&gt;Walloon uprising of 1886&lt;/a&gt; designated a series of insurrectional workers' strikes that began on 18 March with a commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the &lt;a href=\"Paris%20Commune\"&gt;Paris Commune&lt;/a&gt;, organized by the \"Revolutionary Anarchist Group\" of &lt;a href=\"Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt;. There were violent clashes between demonstrators and the police, the army was mobilized and the uprising was crushed, causing the deaths of several dozen strikers.\n\"Le Libertaire\".\nOn 22 October 1893 in Brussels, &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Willems\"&gt;Henri Willems&lt;/a&gt; published the first issue of the bimonthly \"&lt;a href=\"Le%20Libertaire\"&gt;Le Libertaire&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"Socialist-revolutionary organ of the groups of Saint-Josse-ten-Noode\", in Brussels. It contained two epigrams: \"Patriotism is the last refuge of a rascal\" by &lt;a href=\"August%20Spies\"&gt;August Spies&lt;/a&gt; and \"Our enemy is our master\" by &lt;a href=\"Jean%20de%20La%20Fontaine\"&gt;Jean de La Fontaine&lt;/a&gt;, and followed the newspaper \"L'Antipatriote\". However, its printer and publisher were prosecuted in 1894 for press offenses, which led to the stopping of publication of the newspaper.\n\"La D\u00e9b\u00e2cle Sociale\".\nThe first issue of \"La D\u00e9b\u00e2cle sociale\" was published on 4 January 1896 in &lt;a href=\"Ensival\"&gt;Ensival&lt;/a&gt;. Originally published every two weeks, from issue 6 ( 22\u201329 March 1896), it became a weekly. Among the contributors: &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Zisly\"&gt;Henri Zisly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Beylie\"&gt;Henri Beylie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Gravelle\"&gt;\u00c9mile Gravelle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Moineau%20%28anarchist%29\"&gt;Jules Moineau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Augustin%20Hamon\"&gt;Augustin Hamon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%89lis%C3%A9e%20Reclus\"&gt;\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A9verine\"&gt;S\u00e9verine&lt;/a&gt;. After 10 issues, the newspaper stopped on 19 April 1896.\nIn March 1896, \"La D\u00e9b\u00e2cle sociale\" also published in the form of a brochure, the plea by &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Royer\"&gt;\u00c9mile Royer&lt;/a&gt;, \"Pour l\u00b4anarchiste &lt;a href=\"Jules%20Moineau%20%28anarchist%29\"&gt;Jules Moineau&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Le Flambeau\".\nOn 1 November 1902 in Brussels, the first issue of the newspaper \"Le Flambeau\", \"Organe de combat R\u00e9volutionnaire\", came out, edited by Julius Mestag. \"Le Flambeau is not a journal of theory, nor a gossip sheet, it is a revolutionary combat organ, the cry of the oppressed, the expression of a feeling of revolt.\"\nThe Friendly Federation of Anarchists (1904).\nIn 1902, &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Thonar\"&gt;Georges Thonar&lt;/a&gt; chaired the \"revolutionary congress\" of &lt;a href=\"Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt; which was a success of participation but gave few concrete results, in particular because of individualism and the fear of any authoritarianism which paralyzed any beginnings of organization. Dispersed in an multitude of trends, the movement proved incapable of implementing its resolutions, of coordinating its action.\nHowever Thonar continued his project of organizing anarchism. To clarify the positions, he drew up a manifesto, \"What anarchists want\", which excluded from the outset those nostalgic for &lt;a href=\"propaganda%20of%20the%20deed\"&gt;propaganda of the deed&lt;/a&gt; and the \"originals\" who were not conformist.\nFor him, anarchism was located in \"an active propaganda, purely theoretical and without phrases\", aiming at \"integral education\" through study circles, schools, conferences, newspapers and brochures. To ensure \"the development of personal dignity, of the spirit of independence and of feelings of solidarity\", such was the immediate objective of group action. &lt;a href=\"Direct%20action\"&gt;Direct action&lt;/a&gt; was not neglected, but anarchism knew that \"riots\" and \"revolutions\" are not created \"artificially\"; that \"governmental arbitrariness and capitalist exploitation will push the masses that must be educated as a consequence to a gigantic general strike, the prelude to the &lt;a href=\"social%20revolution\"&gt;social revolution&lt;/a&gt;\". He did not reject any idea of &lt;a href=\"reformism\"&gt;reform&lt;/a&gt; because \"the educational action of the struggle waged to obtain them is useful to the working class.\"\nIn October 1904 in &lt;a href=\"Charleroi\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt; and on this basis, Thonar, assisted by &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Chapelier\"&gt;\u00c9mile Chapelier&lt;/a&gt;, brought together a &lt;a href=\"libertarian%20communist\"&gt;libertarian communist&lt;/a&gt; congress of around a hundred fairly representative militants who unanimously adopted his text and laid the foundations for a \"Friendly Federation of Anarchists\".\nThe objectives were, on the one hand, to bring together the anarchists by means of an organization which allowed them to act more methodically, and, on the other hand, to take concrete measures to develop propaganda, whether through conferences, publications or libraries. The organization project, entirely developed by Georges Thonar, in a way leader of the movement at the time, speaks of a libertarian federalism based on voluntary collaboration: each group and each individual retains its autonomy, and no one imposes decisions (which makes it possible to overcome the reluctance of those who fear the appearance of a certain authoritarianism). The organization of the federation was based on three types of gathering: local sections, study and propaganda circles, intended to train members through conferences on both social and scientific subjects; concentration groups meeting monthly and finally the free federation, without statute, holding an annual congress. The publication of a newsletter informs about the state of propaganda and new publications, and its production is carried out each time by a different group in order to develop contacts and avoid excessive centralization. Thonar was appointed secretary, but he was quickly disappointed because, apart from the holding of an annual congress, few actions were organized collectively.\nThe libertarian community \"L\u2019Experience\" (1905\u20131908).\nIn July 1905, the libertarian \"L\u2019Experience\" community in &lt;a href=\"Stokkel/Stockel%20metro%20station\"&gt;Stockel&lt;/a&gt;, was founded by &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Chapelier\"&gt;\u00c9mile Chapelier&lt;/a&gt; and his partner Marie David (&lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Jacquemotte\"&gt;Joseph Jacquemotte&lt;/a&gt;'s sister). It had five to fifteen people, wanting to be an alternative to &lt;a href=\"propaganda%20of%20the%20deed\"&gt;propaganda of the deed&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 what they called \"propaganda by example\". &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Serge\"&gt;Victor Serge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jean%20De%20Bo%C3%AB\"&gt;Jean De Bo\u00eb&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Esperantist\"&gt;Esperantist&lt;/a&gt; activist &lt;a href=\"Eug%C3%A8ne%20Gaspard%20Marin\"&gt;Eug\u00e8ne Gaspard Marin&lt;/a&gt;, notably stayed there.\nThe libertarian communist colony was the Brussels section of the &lt;a href=\"Libertarian%20Communist%20Group\"&gt;Libertarian Communist Group&lt;/a&gt; founded on 25 July 1905 with a view to structuring the movement to carry out joint action and sustained propaganda. Until then, &lt;a href=\"individualism\"&gt;individualism&lt;/a&gt; and the fear of authoritarianism had always pushed anarchists to refuse any form of organization.\nThe project was the implementation of libertarian communism: &lt;a href=\"common%20property\"&gt;common property&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"communal%20work\"&gt;communal work&lt;/a&gt; (gardening and &lt;a href=\"poultry%20farming\"&gt;poultry farming&lt;/a&gt; essentially) and consumption according to the principle of \"&lt;a href=\"From%20each%20according%20to%20their%20ability%2C%20to%20each%20according%20to%20their%20needs\"&gt;From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs&lt;/a&gt;\". It relied on the principle of &lt;a href=\"Mutual%20aid%20%28organization%20theory%29\"&gt;mutual aid&lt;/a&gt; developed by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Kropotkin\"&gt;Peter Kropotkin&lt;/a&gt;. It was an open environment, integrated into the Belgian and international anarchist movement, and multiplying activities for those who came to visit it: newspapers, &lt;a href=\"active%20theater\"&gt;active theater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"conferences\"&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;, etc. On 22 July 1906, the second Belgian Libertarian Communist Congress was held there, which launched the idea of an anarchist international. The colony published multiple brochures, which helped reactivate Belgian and international anarchism, on &lt;a href=\"revolutionary%20syndicalism\"&gt;revolutionary syndicalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"neomalthusianism\"&gt;neomalthusianism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esperanto\"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"free%20love\"&gt;free love&lt;/a&gt;, etc. It was an assumed experimental environment, not wanting to appear as a model, nor as a fixed structure.\nA showcase for anarchism, the colony was open to visitors on Sundays, lectures and plays were given there. The community published many brochures in its collection. On 11 August 1906, it published the first number of the weekly L'\u00c9mancipateur.\nThe Libertarian Communist Group (1905\u20131907).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Libertarian%20Communist%20Group\"&gt;Libertarian Communist Group&lt;/a&gt; (, GCL) was a Belgian anarchist organization founded by about thirty militants on 25 July 1905 and disappeared in August 1907. Its goal was to propagate the ideas of &lt;a href=\"libertarian%20communism\"&gt;libertarian communism&lt;/a&gt; by means of meetings, the creation of education circles, and the publication of newspapers and propaganda books. Its main objective was to structure a movement divided into many tendencies and to create the means necessary for the development of the libertarian press. &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Thonar\"&gt;Georges Thonar&lt;/a&gt; was its general secretary.\nOn 15 October, a congress was held in &lt;a href=\"Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt; to study two questions: the foundation of a libertarian colony and the attitude to adopt in the event of war. At this congress, Thonar clarified that the group was addressing activists who believed in the need to strengthen the organization of propaganda and solidarity, so the group was relatively closed. The GCL adopted a declaration in which it specified that its aim was to propagate the libertarian communist theories defined by the Declaration of principles adopted at the Congress of &lt;a href=\"Charleroi\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt; in 1904.\nIn July 1905, the libertarian \"L'Exp\u00e9rance\" community was created by &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Chapelier\"&gt;\u00c9mile Chapelier&lt;/a&gt; and became the local section of &lt;a href=\"Stokkel/Stockel%20metro%20station\"&gt;Stockel&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of 1906, the first results were quite encouraging: the number of members and sections continued to increase. The GCL managed to ensure the survival of \"L\u2019Insurg\u00e9\" and organized meetings, study circles, and the publication of propaganda books. At that point, the GCL had around 100 activists divided into around 15 sections. The newspaper \"L'Insurg\u00e9\", which Thonar launched in 1903, became \"L\u2019Emancipateur\", \"Organ of the Groupement Communiste Libertaire\" and was published in \"L'Exp\u00e9rance\".\nHowever, the GCL did not alleviate the financial difficulties of the anarchist press, which was one of its primary objectives, and \"L\u2019\u00c9mancipateur\", with its 300 subscribers, did not balance its books. Contacts were spaced out between the different sections and Secretary General Georges Thonar lost contact with his base. Finally, the sections reproached the group for its centralizing tendency and decided to dissolve it at the last general assembly in August 1907. However, it was decided to maintain a network woven by the fraternal relations formed between the members during the meetings and that the action must to develop in a new direction: &lt;a href=\"revolutionary%20syndicalism\"&gt;revolutionary syndicalism&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"L\u2019\u00c9mancipateur\" newspaper.\nFirst period (1906\u20131907).\nOn 11 August 1906, the first issue of the weekly \"L'\u00c9mancipateur\", \"Organ of the Groupement Communiste Libertaire\", published by the libertarian colony founded by \u00c9mile Chapelier, was published in Stockel. Georges Thonar was its administrator and printer. The newspaper ceased to appear in December 1906 after 13 issues appeared. The newspaper \"Le Communiste\" succeeded it in June 1907. Its epigraph was \"&lt;a href=\"from%20each%20according%20to%20their%20ability%3B%20to%20each%20according%20to%20their%20needs\"&gt;from each according to their ability; to each according to their needs&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSecond period (1910\u20131914).\nOn 18 September 1910, the first issue of the newspaper \"L'\u00c9mancipateur\" \"Communist-anarchist revolutionary organ\" came out in Li\u00e8ge. The managing editor responsible for the newspaper was &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Requilez\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Requilez&lt;/a&gt;. The journal was edited from number 24 by the group \"The Seekers of Truth\". Fifty two issues appeared until March 1913. The newspaper was replaced from this date and until July 1913 by \"L'action anarchiste\". \"L\u2019\u00c9mancipateur\" reappeared in March 1914 for a new series of twelve issues, until 2 August 1914. Its epigraph was: \"We want to establish a social environment which ensures to each individual all the sum of happiness adequate for the progressive development of humanity\".\nThird period (1921\u20131925; 1928\u20131936).\nIn July 1921, publication in Fl\u00e9malle of the first number of the newspaper \"L'\u00c9mancipateur\", first subtitled \"Organe communiste-anarchiste R\u00e9volutionnaire\", published by &lt;a href=\"Camille%20Mattart\"&gt;Camille Mattart&lt;/a&gt;. After becoming the newspaper of the &lt;a href=\"Libertarian%20Communist%20Federation\"&gt;Libertarian Communist Federation&lt;/a&gt;, the title disappeared in December 1925 to make way for the newspaper \"Le Combat\". Camille Mattart then republished it periodically from 1928 to 1936.\nThe Brussels Revolutionary Group (1907\u20131909).\nIn July 1908, at the call of the &lt;a href=\"Brussels%20Revolutionary%20Group\"&gt;Brussels Revolutionary Group&lt;/a&gt;, largely from the \"L'Experience\" colony, an anarchist Federation was formed based on \"the free membership of groups, without statutes, without regulations and without a committee\". It published the newspaper \"Le R\u00e9volt\u00e9\".\nThe Belgian General Confederation of Labor (1906\u20131908).\nOn 11 and 12 June 1905 in &lt;a href=\"Charleroi\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt;, a revolutionary trade union congress brought together delegates from 24 localities, mainly in &lt;a href=\"Hainaut%20Province\"&gt;Hainaut&lt;/a&gt;, but also from &lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;, Brussels and &lt;a href=\"Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"miners\"&gt;miners&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glassmakers\"&gt;glassmakers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"typographers\"&gt;typographers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carpenters\"&gt;carpenters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"metallurgists\"&gt;metallurgists&lt;/a&gt; and painters. The congress decided on the principle of the creation of a &lt;a href=\"General%20Confederation%20of%20Labour%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;General Confederation of Labour&lt;/a&gt;. Following the model of the &lt;a href=\"General%20Confederation%20of%20Labour%20%28France%29\"&gt;French CGT&lt;/a&gt;, for the new Confederation, it was a question of bringing together all the trades in a single agreement so as to create an anti-political union capable of carrying out the revolutionary general strike. Its goal is the elimination of wage labor. But unlike France, which was industrialized late but where the workers 'groups were nourished by a revolutionary tradition, Belgium, and in particular the Walloon industrial basins, experienced the first industrial revolution on the continent but a workers' movement which is organized late. Local and professional particularism reigned and union membership was very small30.\nOn 16 July 1905, the first issue of the newspaper \"L\u2019Action Directe\", \"organ of workers\", then \"organ of the General Confederation of Labor\" then \"organ of revolutionary syndicalist propaganda\" appeared in Gilly (Belgium). Founded by &lt;a href=\"L%C3%A9opold%20Preumont\"&gt;L\u00e9opold Preumont&lt;/a&gt;, from June 1907, &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Fuss\"&gt;Henri Fuss&lt;/a&gt; succeeded him at the head of the newspaper which was both a propaganda tool and a rallying center for the unions of &lt;a href=\"Charleroi\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt;, which claim to be in &lt;a href=\"direct%20action\"&gt;direct action&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 28 January 1906 in Brussels, the constitutive congress of the new organization was held, a congress prepared by the \"Union des Travailleurs bruxellois\" founded by &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Fuss\"&gt;Henri Fuss&lt;/a&gt; and in which &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Thonar\"&gt;Georges Thonar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Chapelier\"&gt;\u00c9mile Chapelier&lt;/a&gt; joined in particular. The Belgian CGT grew in the following years but its newspaper, \"L\u2019Action Directe\" and some of its members were prosecuted on several occasions, in particular because of their &lt;a href=\"anti-militarist\"&gt;anti-militarist&lt;/a&gt; positions or their participation in strikes. These lawsuits had the consequence of depriving the movement of its most important activists. These reasons, to which are added a local and professional particularism and the absence of outstanding personalities, caused the end of the CGT in 1908.\nThe Revolutionary Federation.\nIn 1910, the \"Revolutionary Federation\" published the newspaper \"Le combat social\", the leader of which was &lt;a href=\"F%C3%A9lix%20Springael\"&gt;F\u00e9lix Springael&lt;/a&gt;. In the first issue, published under the title of \"Bulletin of the Revolutionary Federation\", the Revolutionary Federation declared itself for integral socialism, for a society in which everyone produces according to their strength and consumes according to their needs.\nThe Amsterdam International Anarchist Congress (1907).\nA large Belgian delegation took part in the &lt;a href=\"International%20Anarchist%20Congress%20in%20Amsterdam\"&gt;International Anarchist Congress in Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; in August 1907, including &lt;a href=\"Georges%20Thonar\"&gt;Georges Thonar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Fuss\"&gt;Henri Fuss&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Chapelier\"&gt;\u00c9mile Chapelier&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Boitsfort\"&gt;Boitsfort&lt;/a&gt;), Segher Rabauw and Samson (&lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;), Janssen and Heiman (&lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;), Schouteten (&lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;), Hamburger and Henri Willems. The &lt;a href=\"Libertarian%20Communist%20Group\"&gt;Libertarian Communist Group&lt;/a&gt; intervened there in particular in the debate on the organization.\nFrom 1914 to 1945.\nLike the international movement, the libertarian movement emerged from the First World War divided, fractured between radical &lt;a href=\"antimilitarists\"&gt;antimilitarists&lt;/a&gt; and supporters of a victory for &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I\"&gt;Western democracies&lt;/a&gt; gathered around the &lt;a href=\"Manifesto%20of%20the%20Sixteen\"&gt;Manifesto of the Sixteen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; was undoubtedly a fatal halt to the development of anarchism all over the world. In &lt;a href=\"Belgium\"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, while until 1914, the libertarian movement was the first censor on the left of the &lt;a href=\"Belgian%20Labour%20Party\"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt;, it gradually lost its influence. The &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution\"&gt;Russian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; of October 1917 aroused enthusiasm among some who joined the &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; movements, while others realized the true &lt;a href=\"dictatorial\"&gt;dictatorial&lt;/a&gt; nature of the new &lt;a href=\"Bolshevik\"&gt;Bolshevik&lt;/a&gt; power.\nMost Belgian anarchists then embarked on newspaper publication. Belgium, during the interwar period, was a land of exile and Belgian militants of this generation welcomed and helped many exiles living in semi-clandestinity: &lt;a href=\"Anarchism%20in%20Italy\"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anarchism%20in%20Germany\"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20anarchists\"&gt;Spanish anarchists&lt;/a&gt;, Jews, &lt;a href=\"conscientious%20objectors\"&gt;conscientious objectors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"neo-Malthusians\"&gt;neo-Malthusians&lt;/a&gt;, etc. The movement was influenced by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Italian%20exiles\"&gt;Italian exiles&lt;/a&gt; fleeing &lt;a href=\"Italian%20fascism\"&gt;fascism&lt;/a&gt; or immigrants seeking work: five anarchist magazines in the Italian language were published in Brussels in the interwar period. Some local activists collaborated on these publications and sometimes edited them, such as &lt;a href=\"Hem%20Day\"&gt;Hem Day&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Jean%20De%20Bo%C3%AB\"&gt;Jean De Bo\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1921, a Belgian Anarchist Communist Federation initially brought together three groups in &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Borinage\"&gt;Borinage&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1924, &lt;a href=\"Hem%20Day\"&gt;Hem Day&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the &lt;a href=\"Anarchism%20in%20Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"anarcho-syndicalists\"&gt;anarcho-syndicalists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Francisco%20Ascaso\"&gt;Francisco Ascaso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buenaventura%20Durruti\"&gt;Buenaventura Durruti&lt;/a&gt;, then on the run to &lt;a href=\"Cuba\"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, into his home for two years. In 1928, the International Committee for Anarchist Defense (CIDA) was created to fight against the expulsions and extraditions of foreign anarchists. A support network was set up around CIDA for many militants living in semi-clandestinity and an exfiltration channel towards South America.\nFrom 1945 to the 1960s.\nAs after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, Belgian anarchism emerged shaken from &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. However, as soon as the last battles had been fought, attempts to rebuild the movement appear. Even if they did not define themselves specifically as an anarchist, by welcoming libertarians and letting them express themselves, several groups participated in this libertarian renewal. Their purpose was &lt;a href=\"social%20justice\"&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pacifism\"&gt;pacifism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anti-militarism\"&gt;anti-militarism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anti-fascism\"&gt;anti-fascism&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\n\"Les Cahiers socialistes\".\nWithout being specifically anarchists, \"Les Cahiers socialistes\", founded in November 1944, brought together independent socialists of all stripes and maintained close relations with groups clearly claiming to be part of the libertarian movement and welcomed in its editorial committee, in 1947, an anarchist activist like &lt;a href=\"Ernestan\"&gt;Ernestan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe editorial line of the review advocated a &lt;a href=\"libertarian%20socialism\"&gt;libertarian socialism&lt;/a&gt; that attempts a critical approach to &lt;a href=\"Marxism\"&gt;Marxism&lt;/a&gt;. For its authors, the very essence of Marxism has been obscured by the too rigid doctrine of political parties. It was important to give more freedom to the socialists, as to the workers. This resolutely libertarian approach led them to adopt a rather nuanced point of view with regard to the debate on the role of &lt;a href=\"the%20State\"&gt;the State&lt;/a&gt;, a conflict which is at the basis of the split of the &lt;a href=\"First%20International\"&gt;First International&lt;/a&gt;. For \"Les Cahiers socialistes\", the &lt;a href=\"Authoritarian%20socialism\"&gt;authoritarian socialists&lt;/a&gt;, by retaining the notion of the State, perpetuate an oppressive system, while in reaction, the anarchists advocate a \"&lt;a href=\"petty-bourgeois\"&gt;petty-bourgeois&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"individualism\"&gt;individualism&lt;/a&gt;. The solution, according to them, lay in an alternative: &lt;a href=\"Workers%27%20self-management\"&gt;self-management&lt;/a&gt;. The journal was certainly not presented as statist, for its authors, the state was neither a form of socialism nor a means of achieving it. \"Les Cahiers socialistes\" believed that each individual had the right to assert their socialist ideal and was categorically opposed to authoritarianism.\n\"Pens\u00e9e et Action\".\nThe \"Pens\u00e9e et Action\" group was founded on 28 March 1945 following a conference by its leader, &lt;a href=\"Marcel%20Dieu\"&gt;Marcel Dieu&lt;/a&gt;. The aim of the group was \"to awaken and develop individual and intellectual consciousness to fight against all forms of authoritarianism\". The group organized more than a hundred conferences on fields as diverse as sociology, politics, economics, &lt;a href=\"psychology\"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt;, literature, philosophy, &lt;a href=\"sciences\"&gt;sciences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fine%20Arts\"&gt;Fine Arts&lt;/a&gt;, etc. The talks were attended by around thirty spectators, sometimes around a hundred.\nThe group publishes an eponymous monthly review which should serve as \"a link between all those who, beyond the fray of today and tomorrow, are looking for the possible bases of a free evolution of men in societies\". It therefore declared itself open to all, as attested by the formula written on the back cover of each issue of the review: \"\"Pens\u00e9e et Action\" intends to seek, beyond any sectarianism, any political or dogmatic ideology, the elements of a genuinely revolutionary culture, defending the merits of the essential demands of the mind and of men!\" Forty-six issues were published between September 1945 and December 1952. From that date until 1970, the review was replaced by \"Les Cahiers de Pens\u00e9e et Action\".\n\"Action commune libertaire\".\n\"Action commune libertaire\" was founded on 2 November 1952, at the call of the libertarian trade unionist &lt;a href=\"Jean%20De%20Bo%C3%AB\"&gt;Jean De Bo\u00eb&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Lepape\"&gt;Alfred Lepape&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Dour\"&gt;Dour&lt;/a&gt;) who was the responsible editor and secretary of the group's publications, Guy Badot (&lt;a href=\"Charleroi\"&gt;Charleroi&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Hem%20Day\"&gt;Hem Day&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;), Georges Simon (&lt;a href=\"Quaregnon\"&gt;Quaregnon&lt;/a&gt;), Joseph De Smet (&lt;a href=\"Ghent\"&gt;Ghent&lt;/a&gt;), Luis Broecke (&lt;a href=\"Antwerp\"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;) and Jean-Baptiste Schaut (&lt;a href=\"Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt;) were also members of the group.\nThe association brought together anarchists of all tendencies and sets itself the objective of providing information intended for a large public. It published &lt;a href=\"pacifist\"&gt;pacifist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anti-militarist\"&gt;anti-militarist&lt;/a&gt; posters and leaflets, recurring themes among libertarians of this generation. The group was quickly undermined by divisions between &lt;a href=\"individualists\"&gt;individualists&lt;/a&gt;, including Hem Day and Joseph de Smet, and the &lt;a href=\"libertarian%20communist\"&gt;libertarian communist&lt;/a&gt; fringe. After 1954 and a few rescue attempts, the group disappeared.\nThe Anarchist Workers' Alliance.\nThe Anarchist Workers' Alliance was created in Brussels at the end of 1956 but never went beyond the groupuscular stage.\nInternational Anti-Fascist Solidarity (SIA).\nThe Belgian section of &lt;a href=\"International%20Antifascist%20Solidarity\"&gt;International Antifascist Solidarity&lt;/a&gt; (SIA) was founded on 18 May 1946 in the form of an association. It brought together &lt;a href=\"anti-fascists\"&gt;anti-fascists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anti-Stalinists\"&gt;anti-Stalinists&lt;/a&gt; around the founders: Joseph De Smet and especially Jean De Bo\u00eb. The association organized the defense of asylum seekers who had fled their country and &lt;a href=\"authoritarian%20regimes\"&gt;authoritarian regimes&lt;/a&gt;. It was a meeting place for immigrants, including the many &lt;a href=\"anarcho-syndicalists\"&gt;anarcho-syndicalists&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Confederation%20of%20Labor\"&gt;National Confederation of Labor&lt;/a&gt; (CNT) in exile.\nIn addition to its activities and galas, the association published brochures and leaflets during important events such as in 1960. For example, at the wedding of Baudouin, the young Belgian king, with Fabiola, from the Spanish nobility, the association denounced the living conditions under the &lt;a href=\"Franco%20dictatorship\"&gt;Franco dictatorship&lt;/a&gt; and the passive collaboration of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20royal%20family\"&gt;royal family&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church%20in%20Spain\"&gt;clerical circles&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1958, young people, including St\u00e9phane Huvenne, joined the association and offered to organize more spectacular or even violent actions, which caused tensions between the new and the old generation mainly made up of non-violent activists. The young Spanish anti-fascists decided to leave SIA and to join the &lt;a href=\"Libertarian%20Youth\"&gt;Libertarian Youth&lt;/a&gt; (FIJL), then in exile on Belgian territory since its ban in France on 9 August 1963.\nWar Resisters' International (WRI).\nWithout being specifically anarchist, the Belgian section of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Resisters%27%20International\"&gt;War Resisters' International&lt;/a&gt; (IRG) brought together many libertarians. Pacifist and antimilitarist, the IRG was the only association which did not base its rejection of war on foundations of a religious nature. It advocated an integral nonviolent pacifism: \"War is a crime against Humanity. For this reason, we are determined not to help any kind of war and to fight for the abolition of all its causes\u201d. The IRG provides concrete support to people who resist militarism and conscription (rebels, conscientious objectors, etc.) and, on a more philosophical level, advocates for \"a world without war and a new social order, where all cooperate for the common good\u201d.\nTwo personalities of the libertarian movement took responsibilities at the international level: &lt;a href=\"Hem%20Day\"&gt;Hem Day&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jean%20Van%20Lierde\"&gt;Jean Van Lierde&lt;/a&gt;. The group published the newsletter \"Non-violence et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\". The action that most mobilized the pacifists of the IRG was the struggle for the recognition of the status of &lt;a href=\"conscientious%20objector\"&gt;conscientious objector&lt;/a&gt; and, in return, the creation of a civilian service. Some libertarians wonder about the value of this status, official recognition by the powers in place, and, even more, about the legitimacy of a civil service, which constituted participation in the workings of the state.\nFrom the 1960s to 2000s.\nFrom January 1960 to June 1963, \"L\u2019Anti-antitoutiste pour la paix\" was published in Brussels. &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Henriquez\"&gt;Jack Henriquez&lt;/a&gt; is the main animator. In 1969, the &lt;a href=\"Dolle%20Mol\"&gt;Dolle Mol&lt;/a&gt; caf\u00e9 was founded, located on Rue des \u00c9peronniers in the center of Brussels. It is a historic place of the Belgian libertarian milieu.\nMay 1968 and leftism.\nThe leftist movement of the years after &lt;a href=\"May%2068\"&gt;May 68&lt;/a&gt; was marked by the influence of anarchism, in particular by &lt;a href=\"spontaneism\"&gt;spontaneism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horizontality\"&gt;horizontality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"direct%20democracy\"&gt;direct democracy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"direct%20action\"&gt;direct action&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Li%C3%A8ge\"&gt;Li\u00e8ge&lt;/a&gt;, in the wake of the events of May 68 and the student movement \"Boule de neige\", the anarchist monthly \"Le Libertaire\" was published, in which &lt;a href=\"No%C3%ABl%20Godin\"&gt;No\u00ebl Godin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edgard%20Morin\"&gt;Edgard Morin&lt;/a&gt;, JP Delriviere, Mihaili Djosson and Yves Thelen participated. The latter, in issue 7 February 1969, wrote the \"Manifesto of the Libertarian\" which specified the line of the monthly under the title \"What is anarchism\".\nSocialisme et Libert\u00e9.\n\u201cSocialisme et Libert\u00e9\" was created in 1966 by &lt;a href=\"Fran%C3%A7ois%20Destryker\"&gt;Fran\u00e7ois Destryker&lt;/a&gt;, but it differed from the rest of the libertarian milieu in Brussels. At the time, a few comrades disseminated libertarian ideas in isolation. \"L'Ordre Libre\", an organ of the \"Cercle La Bo\u00e9tie\", had been distributed by &lt;a href=\"Jean%20De%20Smet\"&gt;Jean De Smet&lt;/a&gt; since 1960. In November 1965, issue 2 of this review appeared, which tells us about the liquidation of the Institute of Possibilities. There was also a Libertarian Center, in premises rented by the Brussels CNT, near the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Place\"&gt;Grand Place&lt;/a&gt; in Brussels.\nThe CNT brought together other comrades. For his part, Hem Day ran the review \"Pens\u00e9e et Action\" and kept alive the libertarian tradition within the &lt;a href=\"pacifist%20movement\"&gt;pacifist movement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freemasonry\"&gt;Freemasonry&lt;/a&gt;. The anarchist movement in the 1960s was therefore limited to a few individuals whose visions for the future were limited to rehashing the past. \"Socialisme et Libert\u00e9\" also made contact with CRIFA: \"Commission des relations de l\u2019 Internationale des Federations anarchistes\", in France.\n\u201c\"Socialisme et Libert\u00e9\"\u201d defended the following positions:\n&lt;a href=\"May%2068\"&gt;May 68&lt;/a&gt; brought with it the anarchist discovery of &lt;a href=\"council%20communism\"&gt;council communism&lt;/a&gt;. The activists of \"Socialisme et Libert\u00e9\" were active during the Free Assemblies organized at ULB. In 1969, \"Socialisme et Libert\u00e9\" took part in the organization of the international meeting of ICO (Information Correspondence Ouvri\u00e8re) in Brussels. This meeting takes place at the Auberge de la Paix, bringing together around a hundred participants. &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Cohn-Bendit\"&gt;Daniel Cohn-Bendit&lt;/a&gt; was present, as well as other participants of May 68. The group \"Socialism and Freedom\" was influenced by \"Noir &amp; Rouge\", which proclaimed itself &lt;a href=\"anarchist-communist\"&gt;anarchist-communist&lt;/a&gt; and many texts, in the review, alluded to contributions of &lt;a href=\"dialectical%20materialism\"&gt;dialectical materialism&lt;/a&gt;. \"Noir &amp; Rouge\" approached anarchism critically and dismantled Russian mystification. The ICO criticized the unions as a cog in the state apparatus and thus answered a fundamental question about the nature of the USSR. Noir &amp; Rouge had 46 issues, going from simple mimeographed sheets to a printed pamphlet format. It had a relative influence during the events of May 1968, Daniel Cohn-Bendit frequented this group. From this moment, \"Socialisme et Libert\u00e9\" argued the question of the nature of unions, that of anarcho-syndicalism. Within \"Socialisme et Libert\u00e9\" an important political deepening was being developed, without however arriving at an autonomous theorization.\n\"L'Alliance\".\nAlliance 89 was founded on 7 January 1969, its main objective was to inform and collect documentation on the anti-authoritarian movement in Belgium. With this in mind, it created a documentation center as well as a library which was in its premises at the Maison de la Paix in &lt;a href=\"Ixelles\"&gt;Ixelles&lt;/a&gt;.\nIts work was not limited to maintaining a library, the Alliance also published brochures by well-known anarchist authors as well as its own newsletter. The Alliance library attempted to bring together libertarian works. It was formed in the wake of Socialisme et Libert\u00e9. It was being developed in a room at the Maison de la Paix, in Ixelles. It was associated with CIRA in Lausanne. With the Alliance, a crossroads was created for meetings. This was the reflexive axis from which various groups claiming to be part of the libertarian movement formed, developed, and disappeared. But the Alliance continued to refer to &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Gu%C3%A9rin\"&gt;Daniel Gu\u00e9rin&lt;/a&gt;. The name of the association referred to the name of the group created by &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Bakunin\"&gt;Mikhail Bakunin&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"First%20International\"&gt;First International&lt;/a&gt;. The association's goal was \"to work on the cultural level for the free development of the human person\". Concretely, the group's mission was to provide the most precise and complete documentation possible to activists, supporters, students or researchers wishing to learn about the anarchist movement, its press, its literature and its actions. To do this, it set up a library containing a large number of books and publications on this subject. Its action also included the publication of publications, periodical or not, the organization of conferences, debates, meetings and seminars. Finally, the association supported free education centers or community houses.A Hem Day Fund committee was also created to manage the documents offered by the anarchist. It was made up of Jean Cordier, Jean Van Lierde, Jean Thys and Fran\u00e7ois Destryker. Indeed, before his death, the anarchist had expressed the wish that his collections be entrusted to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Library%20of%20Belgium\"&gt;Royal Library&lt;/a&gt;. The committee responsible for this fund within the Alliance took a whole series of steps to ensure that these were integrated as quickly as possible into the Albertine's collections. The committee also suggested that officials of the Royal Library provide them with the help of a libertarian objector to speed up the classification of this collection.\n\"Alternative Libertaire\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Alternative%20libertaire%20%28Belgium%29\"&gt;Alternative Libertaire&lt;/a&gt;\" was a monthly newspaper published in Belgium from 1975 to 2005. For the duration of its publication (30 years and 282 issues), its openness to debates and its posters contributed to broadening the audience of libertarian ideas in &lt;a href=\"French-speaking%20Belgium\"&gt;French-speaking Belgium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe richness and notoriety of \"Alternative Libertaire\" was due to the many links that the newspaper forged over time. \"Alternative Libertaire\" was a newspaper written by its readers. A dissident newspaper for different readers. It was a newspaper that wanted to be open to debate. Its goal was not to address convinced activists but to reach out to the periphery of the movement, that is to say the supporters who hesitate to get involved or who by their ideas are interested in libertarian or anti-authoritarian practices.\nThe visibility of the newspaper was such that even today, it is not uncommon to see copies of its very popular posters or placards in bars, associations, libraries or even schools. The openness of the newspaper led the libertarian movement to leave its groupuscular tendencies and played a big role in the propagation of libertarian ideas.\nUnion Communiste Libertaire Bruxelles.\nThe Union Communiste Libertaire Bruxelles is a local Brussels group that is part of the French-speaking anarcho-communist federation &lt;a href=\"Union%20communiste%20libertaire\"&gt;Union communiste libertaire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn March 2013, Brussels anarcho-communist activists in contact with the French organisation &lt;a href=\"Alternative%20libertaire\"&gt;Alternative libertaire&lt;/a&gt; founded a local group Alternative Libertaire Bruxelles. \nIn March 2018, the Brussels collective adopted the operating principles of anarchist \u201cspecifism\u201d (&lt;a href=\"Especifismo\"&gt;Especifismo&lt;/a&gt;). The aim is to strengthen the structure of the organisation and to facilitate the insertion of anarchist activists within social movements.\nThe organisation is structured in thematic fronts of struggle (trade union, feminist, antifascist, queer, social ecology) which aim to coordinate and implement the political line decided by the collective.\nFollowing the merger of Alternative Libertaire and the Coordination des Groupes Anarchistes in 2019, a new anarcho-communist organisation is founded L'Union Communiste Libertaire. The local Brussels group then takes the name of Union Communiste Libertaire Bruxelles. "
