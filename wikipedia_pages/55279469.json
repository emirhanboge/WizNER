He is the current technical coordinator of &lt;a href=\"Atl%C3%A9tico%20Clube%20Goianiense\"&gt;Atl\u00e9tico Goianiense&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nSanches' first experience as first team manager occurred in February 2015, after &lt;a href=\"Marcelo%20Chamusca\"&gt;Marcelo Chamusca&lt;/a&gt;'s dismissal. He was in charge for two further spells during the year, replacing &lt;a href=\"Jorginho%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201965%29\"&gt;Jorginho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilberto%20Pereira\"&gt;Gilberto Pereira&lt;/a&gt;.\nSanches returned to his assistant role in 2016, but was again appointed interim manager on 21 July 2017, replacing sacked &lt;a href=\"Doriva\"&gt;Doriva&lt;/a&gt;. Despite failing to &lt;a href=\"2017%20Campeonato%20Brasileiro%20S%C3%A9rie%20A\"&gt;avoid relegation&lt;/a&gt; with the club, he was definitely named manager on 3 December.\nSanches went back to the assistant role after the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Claudio%20Tencati\"&gt;Claudio Tencati&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently had spells at &lt;a href=\"Associa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Atl%C3%A9tica%20Ponte%20Preta\"&gt;Ponte Preta&lt;/a&gt; (as an assistant) and &lt;a href=\"Associa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Atl%C3%A9tica%20Aparecidense\"&gt;Aparecidense&lt;/a&gt; (as a manager) before returning to \"Drag\u00e3o\" in 2020, as a technical coordinator. On 3 March 2021, after both manager &lt;a href=\"Marcelo%20Cabo\"&gt;Marcelo Cabo&lt;/a&gt; and permanent assistant manager &lt;a href=\"Eduardo%20do%20Nascimento%20Souza\"&gt;Eduardo Souza&lt;/a&gt; left the club, he was named interim manager for the start of the campaign."
