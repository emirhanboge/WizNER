However, Google rejected their request, and added that \"it's not easy to catch out which one is real and fake\". The opposition &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20Korea%20Party\"&gt;Liberty Korea Party&lt;/a&gt; criticised their request as \"media control\".\nOn 31 August 2020, Park was appointed the new Secretary-General of the Democratic Party, under the new President &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Nak-yon\"&gt;Lee Nak-yon&lt;/a&gt;."
