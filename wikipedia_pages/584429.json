    "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Luxor%20AB\"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt; ABC 800 series are &lt;a href=\"personal%20computer\"&gt;office-version&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"ABC%2080\"&gt;ABC 80&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"home%20computer\"&gt;home computer&lt;/a&gt;. They featured an enhanced &lt;a href=\"BASIC\"&gt;BASIC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"interpreter%20%28computing%29\"&gt;interpreter&lt;/a&gt;, a slightly faster clocked CPU and more memory: 32\u00a0kilobytes RAM and 32\u00a0KB ROM was now standard, the &lt;a href=\"Zilog%20Z80\"&gt;Z80&lt;/a&gt; is clocked at (quarter the 12\u00a0MHz crystal). It featured 40\u00d724 text mode with eight colors (ABC 800 C) or 80\u00d724 text mode monochrome (ABC 800 M). They could also be extended with \"high\" resolution graphics (240\u00d7240\u00a0&lt;a href=\"pixels\"&gt;pixels&lt;/a&gt; at 2 bpp) using RAM as video memory.\nThe ABC 800 came in a &lt;a href=\"monochrome\"&gt;monochrome&lt;/a&gt; version with &lt;a href=\"amber%20%28color%29\"&gt;amber&lt;/a&gt; text on a &lt;a href=\"brown%20%28color%29\"&gt;brown&lt;/a&gt; background with an 80 character wide screen, and a color version with 40 characters. The main board is integrated with the keyboard much like the &lt;a href=\"Amiga%20500\"&gt;Amiga 500&lt;/a&gt;. However the ABC computer has a very sturdy metal chassis.\nStorage is usually two &lt;a href=\"Floppy%20disc%235%C2%BC-inch%20floppy%20disk\"&gt;5.25\"&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"floppy%20disk\"&gt;floppy disk&lt;/a&gt; units in 160, 320 or 640\u00a0KB capacity. External hard disk systems became available later (primarily the ABC 850 with 10 MB). Model numbers 'ABC 800 M' for monochrome and 'ABC 800 C' for color.\n\"Who needs &lt;a href=\"IBM%20PC%20compatible\"&gt;IBM-compatibility&lt;/a&gt;?\", asked Luxor's adverts. However, most computer buyers eventually considered it a requirement. A certain compatibility could be achieved between the ABC-world and the IBM PC-world with the help of a program called '&lt;a href=\"W%20ABC\"&gt;W ABC&lt;/a&gt;'.\nThe ABC 800 computer was also sold by &lt;a href=\"Facit\"&gt;Facit&lt;/a&gt; by the name Facit DTC.\nABC 802.\nThe ABC 802 is a compact version with 64\u00a0KB RAM where 32\u00a0KB is used as a RAM disc. The main board is integrated with a 9\" &lt;a href=\"Cathode%20ray%20tube\"&gt;CRT&lt;/a&gt; screen and has improved graphics, though no high-resolution graphics. Luxor ABC 802 was a model with a small monochrome screen in yellow phosphor, intended for offices. Here with two 5.25 inch disk drives along the side of the display. The grey-brown color was common for all ABC 800 (and ABC 1600) products and was different from the beige ABC 80.\nABC 806.\nThe ABC 806 is a version with main board, screen (&lt;a href=\"D-subminiature\"&gt;DA-15&lt;/a&gt;) and keyboard (&lt;a href=\"DIN%20connector\"&gt;DIN-7&lt;/a&gt;) as separate units. It has RAM where is used as a RAM disk, as well as more advanced 512x240x16 graphics.\nPerformance.\nIn order to see how the ABC 800 would compare to other contemporary personal computers, in 1982, the Swedish magazine \"&lt;a href=\"MikroDatorn\"&gt;MikroDatorn&lt;/a&gt;\" performed a \"benchmark\" test using eight short BASIC programs (referred to as BM1~BM8) defined by the American &lt;a href=\"Kilobaud%20Microcomputing\"&gt;Kilobaud Magazine&lt;/a&gt; and routinely used by the British magazine &lt;a href=\"Personal%20Computer%20World\"&gt;Personal Computer World&lt;/a&gt; for testing new machines. \nThe result was that ABC 800's semi-compiling BASIC interpreter turned out to be faster than most other BASICs used in popular machines, especially when &lt;a href=\"integer\"&gt;integer&lt;/a&gt; variables are used, the results for some well known computers were as follows (times in seconds):\n BM1 BM2 BM3 BM4 BM5 BM6 BM7 BM8\n ABC 800 (integer) \"not measured - see &lt;a href=\"ABC%2080\"&gt;ABC 80&lt;/a&gt; for approximate numbers\"\n ABC 800 (single precision) 0.9 1.8 6.0 5.9 6.3 11.6 19.6 29\n ABC 800 (double precision) 1.2 2.2 10.0 10.6 11.0 17.8 26.4 144\n IBM PC 1.5 5.2 12.1 12.6 13.6 23.5 37.4 35\n Apple III 1.7 7.2 13.5 14.5 16.0 27.0 42.5 75\n VIC-20 1.4 8.3 15.5 17.1 18.3 27.2 42.7 99\n ZX81 in \"fast mode\" 4.5 6.9 16.4 15.8 18.6 49.7 68.5 229\nAs seen from the table, the ABC 800 was approximately twice as fast as the IBM PC on &lt;a href=\"floating%20point\"&gt;floating point&lt;/a&gt; calculations, except for BM8 where it was only 20% faster. Using &lt;a href=\"integer\"&gt;integer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Variable%20%28programming%29\"&gt;variables&lt;/a&gt; (only measured for the older &lt;a href=\"ABC%2080\"&gt;ABC 80&lt;/a&gt; in this test) the numbers would be approximately 2-3 times as low (i.e. speeds 2-3 times as high) as for the &lt;a href=\"single%20precision\"&gt;single precision&lt;/a&gt; results in the table."
