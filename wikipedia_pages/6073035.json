    "text": "Pamela Z (born 1956) is an American composer, performer, and media artist who is best known for her solo works for voice with electronic processing. In performance, she combines various vocal sounds including operatic &lt;a href=\"bel%20canto\"&gt;bel canto&lt;/a&gt;, experimental &lt;a href=\"Vocal%20extended%20technique\"&gt;extended techniques&lt;/a&gt; and spoken word, with samples and sounds generated by manipulating found objects. Z's musical aesthetic is one of sonic accretion, and she typically processes her voice in real time through the software program &lt;a href=\"MaxMSP\"&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"MacBook%20Pro\"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; as a means of layering, looping, and altering her live vocal sound. Her performance work often includes video projections and special controllers with sensors that allow her to use physical gestures to manipulate the sound and projected media.\nBiography.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;, and raised in the Denver Metro area, Pamela Z received her bachelor's degree in music from the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder\"&gt;University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;/a&gt; (1978), where she studied classical voice. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she worked as a singer/songwriter on voice and guitar throughout Colorado under the name Pam Brooks. She began experimenting with digital delay and reverb to process her voice in the early 1980s and started composing works involving live looping.\nIn 1984 she relocated to San Francisco where she legally changed her last name to Z and became active in the San Francisco Bay Area &lt;a href=\"Contemporary%20classical%20music\"&gt;contemporary music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"performance%20art\"&gt;performance art&lt;/a&gt; scene.
