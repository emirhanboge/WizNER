Educated at &lt;a href=\"Muir%20College\"&gt;Muir College&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Grey%20High%20School\"&gt;Grey High School&lt;/a&gt;, Smollan was only the second Jew to represent in rugby union, after &lt;a href=\"Morris%20Zimerman\"&gt;Morris Zimerman&lt;/a&gt;. Smollan played club rugby for &lt;a href=\"Wanderers%20RFC\"&gt;Wanderers RFC&lt;/a&gt;, regional rugby for &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Province%20Elephants\"&gt;Eastern Province&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lions\"&gt;Transvaal&lt;/a&gt; and played three times for South Africa in 1933.\nHis three internationals were all against &lt;a href=\"Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on the team's &lt;a href=\"1933%20Australia%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20South%20Africa%20and%20Rhodesia\"&gt;1933 tour&lt;/a&gt; of South Africa. Although he would receive no further caps, he faced international opponents again, facing the &lt;a href=\"1938%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20South%20Africa\"&gt;1938 British Lions&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Transvaal team.

With the outbreak of World War II he served in North Africa. He married Molly Amelia Raphaely in Johannesburg in 1943 and after the war returned to run his business which he built into a public company. Smollan and Molly had two children, Doug (b. 1945) and Katherine (b. 1948).

Smollan remained as its chairman until shortly before his death."
