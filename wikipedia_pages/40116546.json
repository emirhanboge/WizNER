He was raised in &lt;a href=\"Queens\"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; and attended &lt;a href=\"Queens%20College%2C%20City%20University%20of%20New%20York\"&gt;Queens College&lt;/a&gt;, before being &lt;a href=\"Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;drafted&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Army\"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;.

After his military discharge, he returned to get a degree in history at Queens College. He went on to earn a master's degree from the &lt;a href=\"Medill%20School%20of%20Journalism\"&gt;Medill School of Journalism&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Northwestern%20University\"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;, after a two-year radio announcer job at &lt;a href=\"WCTC\"&gt;WCTC&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Brunswick%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Brunswick, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;.\nNational news career.\nAfter obtaining his degree, he moved to Washington, D.C., to work for &lt;a href=\"NBC%20Red%20Network\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;'s radio &lt;a href=\"Network%20affiliate\"&gt;affiliate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"WRC-TV\"&gt;WRC&lt;/a&gt;, before taking an editing job on the network's \"News of the World\" program. A few years later, he became an NBC news correspondent for radio and television. In 1968, he became a &lt;a href=\"White%20House%20press%20corps%23Former%20White%20House%20correspondents\"&gt;White House correspondent&lt;/a&gt;. In 1972, he switched to &lt;a href=\"ABC%20News\"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;, where he remained until his retirement in 1994.\nNotable news stories.\nDuring his four decades of covering news stories, which included 10 presidential campaigns and 19 &lt;a href=\"Presidential%20nominating%20convention\"&gt;nominating conventions&lt;/a&gt;, Kaplow also reported on major events of the &lt;a href=\"civil%20rights%20movement\"&gt;civil rights movement&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;'s 1954 \"&lt;a href=\"Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education\"&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/a&gt;\" ruling to &lt;a href=\"Desegregation\"&gt;desegregate schools&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Freedom%20Riders\"&gt;Freedom Riders&lt;/a&gt;'s struggle to integrate buses in the early 1960s.

This kept Nixon in the public eye, which historian &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Barnouw\"&gt;Erik Barnouw&lt;/a&gt; believed helped Nixon win the &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%201968\"&gt;1968 presidential nomination&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nAfter retiring in 1994, Kaplow lived in &lt;a href=\"Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Falls Church, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, with his wife, Betty. They had three sons: Steven, Bobby and Larry. Herb spent an undisclosed amount of time in an assisted living facility, battling &lt;a href=\"dementia\"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, which affected his ability to speak. He died on July 27, 2013, from a &lt;a href=\"stroke\"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arlington%20County%2C%20Virginia\"&gt;Arlington, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, at the age of 86."
