    "text": "The 1991 Football League Cup Final was a &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; match played on 21 April 1991 between &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.\"&gt;Sheffield Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first of two years that the competition was sponsored by &lt;a href=\"Rumbelows\"&gt;Rumbelows&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the previous season's &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; winners, Manchester United, being favourites to lift the trophy, &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; side Sheffield Wednesday won the match 1\u20130, the winning goal scored by &lt;a href=\"John%20Sheridan%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;John Sheridan&lt;/a&gt;, giving the Owls their first &lt;a href=\"EFL%20Cup\"&gt;League Cup&lt;/a&gt; title in a season when they also won promotion back to the top flight. The match is regarded as one of the most memorable League Cup finals of all time.\nThe trophy was presented to Wednesday skipper &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Pearson\"&gt;Nigel Pearson&lt;/a&gt; by Rumbelows employee of the year Tracy Bateman. Pearson was also named man of the match.\nRoute to final.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Cup\"&gt;Football League Cup&lt;/a&gt; is a cup competition open to clubs in &lt;a href=\"The%20Football%20League\"&gt;The Football League&lt;/a&gt;. It is played on a knockout basis with the first, second and semi-final rounds being contested over a &lt;a href=\"two-legged%20tie\"&gt;two-legged tie&lt;/a&gt;, rounds three to five are settled on the day with &lt;a href=\"replay%20%28sports%29\"&gt;replays&lt;/a&gt; and possibly &lt;a href=\"overtime%20%28sports%29\"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt; required to determine the winner. As clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League, both teams entered the competition in the second round.\nManchester United.\nManchester United's second-round tie saw them drawn against &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division\"&gt;Fourth Division&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Halifax%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Halifax Town&lt;/a&gt;; they won the first leg at &lt;a href=\"The%20Shay\"&gt;The Shay&lt;/a&gt; 3\u20131, with goals from &lt;a href=\"Clayton%20Blackmore\"&gt;Clayton Blackmore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20McClair\"&gt;Brian McClair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Webb\"&gt;Neil Webb&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;a href=\"Viv%20Anderson\"&gt;Viv Anderson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Bruce\"&gt;Steve Bruce&lt;/a&gt; gave them a 2\u20131 win at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Trafford\"&gt;Old Trafford&lt;/a&gt; and a 5\u20132 aggregate victory. Anderson, who was by now rarely used in the United first team, went on to be sold to Sheffield Wednesday three months later, his appearance for United in the early stages of the competition making him ineligible for Wednesday's matches and denying him the chance to add to the two League Cup medals he had won with &lt;a href=\"Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.\"&gt;Nottingham Forest&lt;/a&gt; and a later medal in the competition won with &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey were then drawn against rivals and reigning First Division champions &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; in the third round, where &lt;a href=\"Mark%20Hughes\"&gt;Mark Hughes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Sharpe\"&gt;Lee Sharpe&lt;/a&gt; joined Bruce on the score sheet in a 3\u20131 home win. In the fourth round, a 19-year-old Sharpe scored a hat-trick in addition to goals from Blackmore, Hughes and &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Wallace%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Danny Wallace&lt;/a&gt; to give United a 6\u20132 away win over &lt;a href=\"Arsenal%20F.C.\"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;, who would go on to win the First Division title that season, just over a month after the two teams had been involved in a mass brawl during a 1\u20130 Arsenal win at Old Trafford that saw both teams deducted points.\nIn the fifth round, United were held to a 1\u20131 draw away to &lt;a href=\"Southampton%20F.C.\"&gt;Southampton&lt;/a&gt;, Hughes scoring their only goal; Hughes was again the only United player on the score sheet in the replay a week later, scoring a hat-trick in a 3\u20132 win that put them into the semi-finals. Southampton striker &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Shearer\"&gt;Alan Shearer&lt;/a&gt;, who within months was reported to be transfer target for Manchester United, scoring all of Southampton's goals during the two cup clashes with United.\nGoals from McClair and Sharpe gave United a 2\u20131 win in the first leg of the semi-final at home to &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt;, and Sharpe scored again in the second leg \u2013 his sixth League Cup goal of the season \u2013 as United won 1\u20130, and 3\u20131 on aggregate, to put them into their second League Cup final.\nSheffield Wednesday.\nSheffield Wednesday, whose last major honour had been the FA Cup in 1935, were fresh from relegation to the Second Division when they were drawn against &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Third%20Division\"&gt;Third Division&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brentford%20F.C.\"&gt;Brentford&lt;/a&gt; in the second round, winning 2\u20131 in each of the two legs to put them into the third round. There they met fellow &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Second Division&lt;/a&gt; side &lt;a href=\"Swindon%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Swindon Town&lt;/a&gt;, who held them to a goalless draw at &lt;a href=\"Hillsborough%20Stadium\"&gt;Hillsborough&lt;/a&gt;, before succumbing to a 1\u20130 defeat at the &lt;a href=\"County%20Ground%20%28Swindon%29\"&gt;County Ground&lt;/a&gt; in the replay a week later. Wednesday required another replay in the fourth round, after they played out another draw at home to &lt;a href=\"Derby%20County%20F.C.\"&gt;Derby County&lt;/a&gt;, but beat them 2\u20131 at the &lt;a href=\"Baseball%20Ground\"&gt;Baseball Ground&lt;/a&gt; two weeks later.\nThe quarter-final saw Wednesday drawn away to &lt;a href=\"Coventry%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Coventry City&lt;/a&gt;, where a 1\u20130 victory for Wednesday ended any hopes that Coventry's new player-manager &lt;a href=\"Terry%20Butcher\"&gt;Terry Butcher&lt;/a&gt; might have had of beginning his managerial career with silverware. Their semi-final opponents were &lt;a href=\"Chelsea%20F.C.\"&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;. The first leg of the semi-final was played at &lt;a href=\"Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29\"&gt;Stamford Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, where goals from &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Shirtliff\"&gt;Peter Shirtliff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"David%20Hirst%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;David Hirst&lt;/a&gt; gave them a 2\u20130 win, before &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Pearson\"&gt;Nigel Pearson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Danny%20Wilson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201960%29\"&gt;Danny Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Williams%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201965%29\"&gt;Paul Williams&lt;/a&gt; gave them a 3\u20131 win in the second leg at Hillsborough to put them into the final, 5\u20131 on aggregate. It was Wednesday's first Wembley cup final in 25 years.\nYorkshire Television controversy.\nThe broadcast of this League Cup final caused controversy in &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire\"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, where instead of showing the post-match celebrations (as &lt;a href=\"London%20Weekend%20Television\"&gt;London Weekend Television&lt;/a&gt; did), &lt;a href=\"Yorkshire%20Television\"&gt;Yorkshire Television&lt;/a&gt; decided to cut the broadcast short to show a programme titled \"War of the Monster Trucks\". People from Sheffield often cite this event as a demonstration of the station's bias towards &lt;a href=\"West%20Yorkshire\"&gt;West Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leeds\"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt; and above all &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.\"&gt;Leeds United&lt;/a&gt;. The incident inspired the name of the Sheffield Wednesday &lt;a href=\"fanzine\"&gt;fanzine&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Monster%20Trucks\"&gt;War of the Monster Trucks&lt;/a&gt;\"."
