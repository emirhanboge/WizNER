    "text": "John Edgell Rickword, &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;MC&lt;/a&gt; (22 October 1898 \u2013 15 March 1982) was an English poet, critic, journalist and literary editor. He became one of the leading &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; intellectuals active in the 1930s.\nEarly life.\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Colchester\"&gt;Colchester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Essex\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;, where he attended the &lt;a href=\"Colchester%20Royal%20Grammar%20School\"&gt;local grammar school&lt;/a&gt;. He served as an officer in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Army\"&gt;British Army&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, having joined the &lt;a href=\"Artists%27%20Rifles\"&gt;Artists' Rifles&lt;/a&gt; in 1916, being awarded a &lt;a href=\"Military%20Cross\"&gt;Military Cross&lt;/a&gt;. He was a published &lt;a href=\"war%20poet\"&gt;war poet&lt;/a&gt;, and collected his early verse in \"Behind the Eyes\" (1921).\nOn 4 January 1919, Rickword developed an illness that was diagnosed as a \"general vascular invasion which had resulted in general septicaemia\". His left eye was so badly infected that they thought it necessary to remove it to prevent the infection from spreading to the other eye.\nHe went up to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oxford\"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt; in 1919, staying only four terms reading French literature, and leaving when he married. Literary friends from this period included mainly other ex-soldiers: &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Bertram\"&gt;Anthony Bertram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edmund%20Blunden\"&gt;Edmund Blunden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivian%20de%20Sola%20Pinto\"&gt;Vivian de Sola Pinto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A.%20E.%20Coppard\"&gt;A. E. Coppard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Golding\"&gt;Louis Golding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Graves\"&gt;Robert Graves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"L.%20P.%20Hartley\"&gt;L. P. Hartley&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alan%20Porter\"&gt;Alan Porter&lt;/a&gt;. His work appeared in the \"Oxford Poetry\" 1921 &lt;a href=\"anthology\"&gt;anthology&lt;/a&gt;, with Blunden, Golding, Porter, Graves, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Hughes%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Richard Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Prewett\"&gt;Frank Prewett&lt;/a&gt;.\nCritic.\nHe then took up literary work in London. He reviewed for &lt;a href=\"The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement\"&gt;the \"Times Literary Supplement\"&lt;/a&gt;, which led to his celebrated review of &lt;a href=\"T.%20S.%20Eliot\"&gt;T. S. Eliot&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Waste%20Land\"&gt;The Waste Land&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"J.%20C.%20Squire\"&gt;J. C. Squire&lt;/a&gt; published him in the \"London Mercury\", and &lt;a href=\"Desmond%20MacCarthy\"&gt;Desmond MacCarthy&lt;/a&gt; as literary editor of the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20Statesman\"&gt;New Statesman&lt;/a&gt;\" gave him work.\nHe started the \"&lt;a href=\"Calendar%20of%20Modern%20Letters\"&gt;Calendar of Modern Letters&lt;/a&gt;\" literary review, now highly regarded, in March 1925. It lasted until July 1927, assisted by &lt;a href=\"Douglas%20Garman\"&gt;Douglas Garman&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Bertram%20Higgins\"&gt;Bertram Higgins&lt;/a&gt;, and contributions from his cousin &lt;a href=\"C.%20H.%20Rickword\"&gt;C. H. Rickword&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Scrutinies\" books of collected pieces from it were a \"succes d'estime\"; the purpose of the publication was a mass killing of the sacred cows of Edwardian literature (&lt;a href=\"G.%20K.%20Chesterton\"&gt;G. K. Chesterton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Galsworthy\"&gt;John Galsworthy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Masefield\"&gt;John Masefield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Bernard%20Shaw\"&gt;George Bernard Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"H.%20G.%20Wells\"&gt;H. G. Wells&lt;/a&gt;). Its undoubted influence as a precursor of later criticism was very marked in the early days of \"&lt;a href=\"Scrutiny%20%28journal%29\"&gt;Scrutiny&lt;/a&gt;\", the magazine founded a few years later by &lt;a href=\"F.%20R.%20Leavis\"&gt;F. R. Leavis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Q.%20D.%20Leavis\"&gt;Q. D. Leavis&lt;/a&gt;. Rickword also wrote for that publication.\nCommunist.\nHe joined the &lt;a href=\"Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Communist Party of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; in 1934, and became increasingly active in political work during the period of the &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Spanish Civil War&lt;/a&gt;; while still writing poetry. He was friendly with &lt;a href=\"Randall%20Swingler\"&gt;Randall Swingler&lt;/a&gt;, the 'official' poetry voice of the CPGB, and with &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Lindsay%20%28writer%29\"&gt;Jack Lindsay&lt;/a&gt;, his only real rival as a theoretician. He was closely connected with the leading cultural figures on the hard Left, such as &lt;a href=\"Mulk%20Raj%20Anand\"&gt;Mulk Raj Anand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Fox\"&gt;Ralph Fox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Julius%20Lipton\"&gt;Julius Lipton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A.%20L.%20Morton\"&gt;A. L. Morton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvia%20Townsend%20Warner\"&gt;Sylvia Townsend Warner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alick%20West\"&gt;Alick West&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Lawrence%20%26amp%3B%20Wishart\"&gt;Lawrence &amp; Wishart&lt;/a&gt; was created as the official CPGB publishing house, in 1936, Rickword became a director. It was through Rickword that Lawrence &amp; Wishart published &lt;a href=\"Nancy%20Cunard\"&gt;Nancy Cunard&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Negro: An Anthology\", though at her own expense.\nAt that same period he was a co-founder of the \"&lt;a href=\"Left%20Review\"&gt;Left Review&lt;/a&gt;\", which he edited. His associates included &lt;a href=\"James%20Boswell%20%28artist%29\"&gt;James Boswell&lt;/a&gt;, who was the art editor; they had met around 1929. \"Left Review\" existed from 1934 to 1938, was set up by Rickword and Douglas Garman, had as writers both CPGB members and notable figures outside the party, and founded Marxist criticism in the UK.\nLater he became Editor of \"Our Time\", the Communist review, from 1944 to 1947, working with &lt;a href=\"Arnold%20Rattenbury\"&gt;Arnold Rattenbury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"David%20Holbrook\"&gt;David Holbrook&lt;/a&gt;. Rickword had an upbeat view at the time on the possibilities of popular culture and radical politics, and the circulation rose as he broadened the publication's scope from popular political poetry. The post-war clique around \"Our Time\", the Salisbury Group (named for a pub), included &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Hill%20%28historian%29\"&gt;Christopher Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Hobday\"&gt;Charles Hobday&lt;/a&gt;, Holbrook, Mervyn Jones, Lindsay, Rattenbury, &lt;a href=\"Montagu%20Slater\"&gt;Montagu Slater&lt;/a&gt;, Swingler, &lt;a href=\"E.%20P.%20Thompson\"&gt;E. P. Thompson&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Doris%20Lessing\"&gt;Doris Lessing&lt;/a&gt; joined it."
