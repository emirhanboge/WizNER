    "text": "The 1976 Chatham Cup was the 49th annual nationwide knockout &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; competition in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly stages of the competition were run in three regions (northern, central, and southern), with the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20National%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; teams receiving a bye until the later stages of the competition. In all, 146 teams took part in the competition - a record for the time. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article.\nThe 1976 final.\n&lt;a href=\"Christchurch%20United\"&gt;Christchurch United&lt;/a&gt;, coached by Terry Conley, became only the second team (after &lt;a href=\"Waterside%20%28Wellington%29\"&gt;Waterside&lt;/a&gt; in 1938-40) to win the cup on three successive occasions. Seven players played on all three winning sides, among them future New Zealand captain &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Sumner\"&gt;Steve Sumner&lt;/a&gt;. Three of these players (&lt;a href=\"Graham%20Griffiths\"&gt;Graham Griffiths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Hardman\"&gt;Brian Hardman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Park\"&gt;Ian Park&lt;/a&gt;) had also played in Christchurch United's winning side in the &lt;a href=\"1972%20Chatham%20Cup\"&gt;1972 final&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final against &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Suburbs%20AFC\"&gt;Eastern Suburbs&lt;/a&gt; was a one-sided affair (United had had a harder task in their semi-final against &lt;a href=\"Blockhouse%20Bay%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;Blockhouse Bay&lt;/a&gt;). The South Island side scored four, though the first of these was an own goal by Suburbs' Tom Bell. Norman Moran picked up a brace before the scoring was completed by Mark McNaughton."
