    "text": "The common myna or Indian myna (\"Acridotheres tristis\"), sometimes spelled mynah, is a &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Family%20%28biology%29\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sturnidae\"&gt;Sturnidae&lt;/a&gt;, native to Asia. An omnivorous open woodland bird with a strong territorial instinct, the common myna has adapted extremely well to &lt;a href=\"Urban%20area\"&gt;urban&lt;/a&gt; environments.\nThe range of the common myna is increasing at such a rapid rate that in 2000 the &lt;a href=\"IUCN%20Species%20Survival%20Commission\"&gt;IUCN Species Survival Commission&lt;/a&gt; declared it one of the world's most &lt;a href=\"invasive%20species\"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt; and one of only three birds listed among \"100 of the World's Worst Invasive Species\" that pose a threat to biodiversity, agriculture and human interests. In particular, the species poses a serious threat to the &lt;a href=\"ecosystem\"&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, where it was named \"The Most Important Pest/Problem\" in 2008.\nTaxonomy.\nIn 1760, the French zoologist &lt;a href=\"Mathurin%20Jacques%20Brisson\"&gt;Mathurin Jacques Brisson&lt;/a&gt; included a description of the common myna in his \"Ornithologie\", based on a specimen that he mistakenly believed had been collected in the Philippines. He used the French name \"Le merle des Philippines\" and the Latin \"Merula Philippensis\". Although Brisson coined Latin names, they do not conform to the &lt;a href=\"binominal%20nomenclature\"&gt;binominal system&lt;/a&gt; and are not recognised by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature\"&gt;International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Swedish naturalist, &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Linnaeus\"&gt;Carl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt;, updated his \"&lt;a href=\"Systema%20Naturae\"&gt;Systema Naturae&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1766, for the &lt;a href=\"12th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae\"&gt;12th edition&lt;/a&gt;, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of them was the common myna. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the &lt;a href=\"binominal%20name\"&gt;binominal name&lt;/a&gt; \"Paradisea tristis\" and cited Brisson's work. The &lt;a href=\"type%20location%20%28biology%29\"&gt;type location&lt;/a&gt; was subsequently corrected to &lt;a href=\"Pondicherry\"&gt;Pondicherry&lt;/a&gt; in southern India. The &lt;a href=\"Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29\"&gt;specific name&lt;/a&gt; \"tristis\" is Latin for \"sad\" or \"gloomy\". This species is now placed in the genus \"&lt;a href=\"Acridotheres\"&gt;Acridotheres&lt;/a&gt;\" that was introduced by the French ornithologist &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot\"&gt;Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot&lt;/a&gt; in 1816. The generic name \"Acridotheres\" is from the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; \u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 (\"akridos\"), meaning locust, and \u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 (\"theras\"), meaning hunter.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"subspecies\"&gt;subspecies&lt;/a&gt; are recognised:\nThe Sri Lankan subspecies \"melanosternus\" is darker than the Indian subspecies \"tristis\" and has half-black and half-white primary coverts and a larger yellow cheek-patch.\nDescription.\nThe common myna is readily identified by the brown body, black hooded head and the bare yellow patch behind the eye. The bill and legs are bright yellow. There is a white patch on the outer primaries and the wing lining on the underside is white. The sexes are similar and birds are usually seen in pairs.\nThe common myna obeys &lt;a href=\"Gloger%27s%20rule\"&gt;Gloger's rule&lt;/a&gt; in that the birds from northwestern India tend to be paler than their darker counterparts in southern India.\nVocalization.\nThe &lt;a href=\"bird%20vocalization\"&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; includes croaks, squawks, chirps, clicks, whistles and 'growls', and the bird often fluffs its feathers and bobs its head in singing. The common myna screeches warnings to its mate or other birds in cases of predators in proximity or when it is about to take off flying. Common mynas are popular as cage birds for their singing and \"speaking\" abilities. Before sleeping in communal roosts, common mynas vocalise in unison, which is known as \"communal noise\".\nMorphometry.\nMorphometry.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe common myna is native to &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, with its initial home range spanning &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pakistan\"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nepal\"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bhutan\"&gt;Bhutan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bangladesh\"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sri%20Lanka\"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uzbekistan\"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tajikistan\"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkmenistan\"&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Myanmar\"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, peninsular &lt;a href=\"Thailand\"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indochina\"&gt;Indochina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; (both &lt;a href=\"mainland%20Japan\"&gt;mainland Japan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ryukyu%20Islands\"&gt;Ryukyu Islands&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe common myna has been introduced to many other parts of the world such as &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Caledonia\"&gt;New Caledonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"South%20Florida\"&gt;South Florida&lt;/a&gt; only), &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kyrgyzstan\"&gt;Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uzbekistan\"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;, the Cayman Islands, islands in the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Ocean\"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Seychelles\"&gt;Seychelles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mauritius\"&gt;Mauritius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"R%C3%A9union\"&gt;R\u00e9union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madagascar\"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Maldives\"&gt;Maldives&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Andaman%20and%20Nicobar%20Islands\"&gt;Andaman and Nicobar Islands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lakshadweep\"&gt;Lakshadweep&lt;/a&gt; archipelago) and also in islands of the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Ocean\"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"Ascension%20Island\"&gt;Ascension&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Helena\"&gt;Saint Helena&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Ocean\"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;s. The range of the common myna is increasing to the extent that in 2000 the &lt;a href=\"IUCN%20Species%20Survival%20Commission\"&gt;IUCN Species Survival Commission&lt;/a&gt; declared it among 100 of the world's worst &lt;a href=\"invasive%20species\"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is typically found in open woodland, cultivation and around habitation. Although it is an adaptable species, its population is abnormal and very much considered a pest in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; (where it is locally called as \"gembala kerbau\", literally 'buffalo shepherd') due to competition with the related introduced &lt;a href=\"Javan%20myna\"&gt;Javan myna&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe common myna thrives in urban and suburban environments; in &lt;a href=\"Canberra\"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, 110 common mynas were released between 1968 and 1971. By 1991, common myna population density in Canberra averaged 15 birds per square kilometer. Only three years later, a second study found an average population density of 75 birds per square kilometer in the same area.\nThe bird likely owes its success in the urban and suburban settings of Sydney and Canberra to its &lt;a href=\"evolution\"&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt;ary origins; having evolved in the open &lt;a href=\"woodland\"&gt;woodland&lt;/a&gt;s of India, the common myna is pre-adapted to habitats with tall vertical structures and little to no vegetative ground cover, features characteristic of city streets and urban nature preserves.\nThe common myna (along with &lt;a href=\"common%20starling\"&gt;common starling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"house%20sparrow\"&gt;house sparrow&lt;/a&gt;s, and feral &lt;a href=\"rock%20dove\"&gt;rock dove&lt;/a&gt;s) is a nuisance to city buildings; its nests block gutters and drainpipes, causing water damage to building exteriors.\nBehaviour.\nBreeding.\nCommon mynas are believed to pair for life. They breed through much of the year depending on the location, building their nest in a hole in a tree or wall. They breed at elevations of in the &lt;a href=\"Himalayas\"&gt;Himalayas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe normal &lt;a href=\"Clutch%20%28eggs%29\"&gt;clutch&lt;/a&gt; size is 4\u20136 eggs. The average size of the egg is . The incubation period is 17 to 18 days and fledging period is 22 to 24 days. The &lt;a href=\"Asian%20koel\"&gt;Asian koel&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes &lt;a href=\"brood%20parasitism\"&gt;brood parasitic&lt;/a&gt; on this species. Nesting material used by common mynas includes twigs, roots, tow and rubbish. Common mynas have been known to use tissue paper, tin foil and sloughed off snake-skin.\nDuring the breeding season, the daytime activity-time budget of the common myna in Pune in April to June 1978 has been recorded to comprise the following: nesting activity (42%), scanning the environment (28%), locomotion (12%), feeding (4%), vocalisation (7%) and preening-related activities, interactions and other activities (7%).\nThe common myna uses the nests of woodpeckers, parakeets, etc. and easily takes to nest boxes; it has been recorded evicting the chicks of previously nesting pairs by holding them in the beak and later sometimes not even using the emptied nest boxes. This aggressive behaviour contributes to its success as an invasive species.\nThere is also some evidence that shows that in introduced environments, the species chooses to nest in more modified and artificial structures than in natural tree cavities when compared to native species.\nFood and feeding.\nLike most starlings, the common myna is omnivorous. It feeds on &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"arachnid\"&gt;arachnid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crustacean\"&gt;crustacean&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"reptile\"&gt;reptile&lt;/a&gt;s, small mammals, seeds, grain and fruits and discarded waste from human habitation. It forages on the ground among grass for insects, and especially for &lt;a href=\"grasshopper\"&gt;grasshopper&lt;/a&gt;s, from which it gets the generic name \"Acridotheres\", \"grasshopper hunter\". It, however, feeds on a wide range of insects, mostly picked from the ground. It is a cross-pollinator of flowers such as \"Salmalia\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Erythrina\"&gt;Erythrina&lt;/a&gt;\". It walks on the ground with occasional hops and is an opportunistic feeder on the insects disturbed by grazing cattle as well as fired grass fields. Living in close proximity to human-made habitats, common mynas may also appear near roadsides to feed on roadkill.\nRoosting behaviour.\nCommon mynas roost communally throughout the year, either in pure or mixed flocks with &lt;a href=\"jungle%20myna\"&gt;jungle myna&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rosy%20starling\"&gt;rosy starling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"house%20crow\"&gt;house crow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20crow\"&gt;jungle crow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cattle%20egret\"&gt;cattle egret&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"rose-ringed%20parakeet\"&gt;rose-ringed parakeet&lt;/a&gt;s and other birds. The roost population can range from less than one hundred to thousands. The time of arrival of mynas at the roost starts before and ends just after sunset. The mynas depart before sunrise. The time and timespan of arrival and departure, time taken for final settlement at the roost, duration of communal sleep, flock size and population vary seasonally.\nThe function of &lt;a href=\"communal%20roosting\"&gt;communal roosting&lt;/a&gt; is to synchronise various social activities, avoid predators, exchange information about food sources.\nCommunal displays (pre-roosting and post-roosting) consist of aerial maneuvers which are exhibited in the pre-breeding season (November to March). It is assumed that this behaviour is related to pair formation.\nInvasive species.\nThe IUCN declared the common myna as one of only three birds among the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20globally%20invasive%20species\"&gt;world's 100 worst invasive species&lt;/a&gt; (the other two being the &lt;a href=\"red-vented%20bulbul\"&gt;red-vented bulbul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"common%20starling\"&gt;common starling&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe French introduced it in the 18th century from Pondicherry to Mauritius with the aim of controlling insects, even levying a fine on anyone persecuting the bird. It has since been introduced widely elsewhere, including adjacent areas in &lt;a href=\"Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madagascar\"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20East\"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, Spain and Portugal, the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and various oceanic islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including prominent populations in &lt;a href=\"Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hawaii\"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe common myna is regarded as a pest in South Africa, North America, the Middle East, Australia, New Zealand and many Pacific islands. It is particularly problematic in Australia. Several methods have been tried to control the bird's numbers and protect native species.\nAustralia.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the common myna is an &lt;a href=\"Invasive%20species\"&gt;invasive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pest%20%28animal%29\"&gt;pest&lt;/a&gt;. They are often the predominant bird in urban areas along the whole &lt;a href=\"eastern%20states%20of%20Australia\"&gt;east coast&lt;/a&gt;. In a 2008 popular vote, the bird was named \"The Most Important Pest/Problem\" in Australia. They have earned the nickname \"flying rats\", due to their numbers and their scavenging behaviour. They are also known as \"the &lt;a href=\"cane%20toad\"&gt;cane toad&lt;/a&gt; of the sky\".\nThe common myna was first introduced to Australia between 1863 and 1872, in &lt;a href=\"Victoria%20%28Australia%29\"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, to control insects in the market gardens of &lt;a href=\"Melbourne\"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. The bird is likely to have spread to &lt;a href=\"New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; (where it is currently most populous) at around the same time, but documentation is uncertain. The bird was later introduced to Queensland as a predator of &lt;a href=\"grasshopper\"&gt;grasshopper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cane%20beetle\"&gt;cane beetle&lt;/a&gt;s. Common myna populations in Australia are now concentrated along the eastern coast around &lt;a href=\"Sydney\"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounding suburbs, with sparser populations in Victoria and a few isolated communities in &lt;a href=\"Queensland\"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;. During 2009 several municipal councils in New South Wales began trials of catching myna birds in an effort to reduce numbers.\nThe myna can live and breed in a wide range of temperatures, ranging from the harsh winters of &lt;a href=\"Canberra\"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; to the tropical climate of &lt;a href=\"Cairns\"&gt;Cairns&lt;/a&gt;. Self-sustaining populations have been found in regions with a mean monthly warmest temperature no less than and a mean monthly coldest temperature no less than , implying that the common myna could spread from Sydney northward along the eastern coast to Cairns, and westward along the southern coast to &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;, but not to &lt;a href=\"Tasmania\"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory\"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; or the arid interior regions.\nEurope.\nIn 2019, common mynas were added to the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20invasive%20alien%20species%20of%20Union%20concern\"&gt;List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern&lt;/a&gt;. They have established in Spain and Portugal and were introduced to France, where they occasionally bred.\nNew Zealand.\nThe common myna was introduced to both the North Island and South Island of New Zealand in the 1870s. However, the cooler summer temperatures in the South Island appear to have impeded the breeding success rate of the southern populations, preventing the proliferation of the species, which was largely non-existent there by the 1890s. In contrast, the North Island population was able to breed more successfully and large portions of the North Island are now populated. However, in the southern reaches of the North Island, the cooler summer temperatures, like those of the South Island, have prevented the establishment of large myna populations. Since the 1950s, mynas continued to migrate north and subsequently populating beyond the Waikato region, leading to a majority of its successful population thriving upon higher latitude regions due to warmer climate. At present, mynas have become especially common in regions of higher latitude, particularly the Northland region, but rarely found south of Whanganui.\nSouth Africa.\nIn South Africa where it escaped into the wild in 1902, it has become very common and its distribution is greater where human populations are greater or where there is more human disturbance. The bird is also notorious for being a pest, kicking other birds out of their nests and killing their young due to the myna's strong territorial instinct. In South Africa it is considered somewhat of a major pest and disturbance of the natural habitat; as a result, it has been declared an invasive species, requiring it to be controlled.\nMorphological studies show that the process of spatial sorting is at work on the range expansion of \"A. tristis\" in South Africa. Dispersal-relevant traits are significantly correlated with distance from the range core, with strong sexual dimorphism, indicative of sex-biased dispersal. Morphological variations are significant in wing and head traits of females, suggesting females as the primary dispersing sex. In contrast, traits not related to dispersal such as those associated with foraging show no signs of spatial sorting but are significantly affected by environmental variables such as vegetation and intensity of urbanisation.\nThe United States.\nIn Hawaii, it is out-competing many native birds for food and nesting areas.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//hbs.bishopmuseum.org/birds/rlp-monograph/pdfs/07-ZOST-ESTR/COMY.pdf\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nTo study the invasion genetics and landscape-scale dynamics of \"A. tristis\", scientists have recently developed 16 polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers using the &lt;a href=\"next%20generation%20sequencing\"&gt;next generation sequencing&lt;/a&gt; (NGS) approach.\nEffect on ecosystems and humans.\nThreat to native birds.\nThe common myna is a hollow-nesting species; that is, it nests and breeds in protected hollows found either naturally in trees or artificially on buildings (for example, recessed windowsills or low eaves). Compared to native hollow-nesting species, the common myna is extremely aggressive, and breeding males will actively defend areas ranging up to 0.83 &lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;hectare&lt;/a&gt;s in size (though males in densely populated urban settings tend to only defend the area immediately surrounding their nests).\nThis aggressiveness has enabled the common myna to displace many breeding pairs of native hollow-nesters, thereby reducing their reproductive success. In Australia, their aggressiveness has enabled them to chase native birds as large as &lt;a href=\"galah\"&gt;galah&lt;/a&gt;s out of their nests.\nThe common myna is also known to maintain up to two &lt;a href=\"Bird%23Resting%20and%20roosting\"&gt;roost&lt;/a&gt;s simultaneously; a temporary summer roost close to a breeding site (where the entire local male community sleeps during the summer, the period of highest aggression), and a permanent all-year roost where the female broods and incubates overnight. Both male and female common mynas will fiercely protect both roosts at all times, leading to further exclusion of native birds.\nThreat to crops and pasture.\nThe common myna (which feeds mostly on ground-dwelling &lt;a href=\"insect\"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s, tropical fruits such as grapes, plums and some &lt;a href=\"Berry\"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt; and, in urban areas, discarded human food) poses a serious threat to Australian &lt;a href=\"blueberry\"&gt;blueberry&lt;/a&gt; crops, though its main threat is to native bird species.\nIn Hawaii, where the common myna was introduced to control pest &lt;a href=\"Mythimna%20separata\"&gt;armyworms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cutworm\"&gt;cutworm&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"sugarcane\"&gt;sugarcane&lt;/a&gt; crops, the bird has helped to spread the robust \"&lt;a href=\"Lantana%20camara\"&gt;Lantana camara&lt;/a&gt;\" weed across the islands\u2019 open &lt;a href=\"grassland\"&gt;grassland&lt;/a&gt;s. It also has been recorded as the fourth-ranking avian pest in the fruit industry by a 2004 survey of the Hawaiian Farm Bureau and the sixth in number of complaints of avian pests overall.\nCommon mynas can cause considerable damage to ripening fruit, particularly grapes, but also figs, apples, pears, strawberries, blueberries, guava, mangoes and breadfruit. Cereal crops such as maize, wheat and rice are susceptible where they occur near urban areas. Roosting and nesting commensal with humans create aesthetic and health concerns. Common mynas are known to carry avian malaria and exotic parasites such as the \"Ornithonyssus bursia\" mite, which can cause dermatitis in humans. The common myna can help spread agricultural weeds: for example, it spreads the seeds of \"Lantana camara\", which has been classed as a Weed of National Significance because of its invasiveness. Common mynas are regularly observed to usurp nests and hollows, destroy the eggs and kill the young of native bird species, including seabirds and parrots. There is evidence that common mynas have killed small land\nmammals such as mice, squirrels and possums, but further research on these occurrences is under consideration.\nControl.\nThe common myna, being a major agricultural pest and posing a threat to native species in non-native countries, is controlled by various factors. Mynas are either killed or chased away as control. Poison, shooting, cage traps, and bird-scaring devices are currently used for control.\nRelationship with humans.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Sanskrit\"&gt;Sanskrit&lt;/a&gt; literature, the common myna has a number of names, most are descriptive of the appearance or behaviour of the bird. In addition to \"saarika\", the names for the common myna include \"kalahapriya\", which means \"one who is fond of arguments\" referring to the quarrelsome nature of this bird; \"chitranetra\", meaning \"picturesque eyes\"; \"peetanetra\" (one with yellow eyes) and \"peetapaad\" (one with yellow legs)."
