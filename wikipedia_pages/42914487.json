    "text": "The gens Fufia was a &lt;a href=\"plebs\"&gt;plebeian&lt;/a&gt; family at &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Rome\"&gt;ancient Rome&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"gens\"&gt;gens&lt;/a&gt; does not appear to have been of great antiquity, and only appears in history toward the beginning of the first century BC.\nOrigin.\nThis gens has been frequently confounded, both in manuscripts and by the earlier scholars, with a Fusia gens, which did not exist, at least during the latter period of the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Republic\"&gt;Republic&lt;/a&gt;, and is only the ancient form of the name of the &lt;a href=\"Furia%20gens\"&gt;Furia gens&lt;/a&gt;. The Fufii do not occur in history until the seventh century of the city. The surname \"Calenus\" borne by some of this family is probably derived from the town of &lt;a href=\"Cales\"&gt;Cales&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Campania\"&gt;Campania&lt;/a&gt;. It is not improbable that the whole Fufia gens originally came from Campania.\nPraenomina used.\nThe Fufii are known to have used the praenomina \"&lt;a href=\"Gaius%20%28praenomen%29\"&gt;Gaius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20%28praenomen%29\"&gt;Quintus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucius%20%28praenomen%29\"&gt;Lucius&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Marcus%20%28praenomen%29\"&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBranches and cognomina.\nThe only cognomens of the Fufii are \"Calenus\" and \"Geminus.\" The former is probably derived from Cales, a &lt;a href=\"municipium\"&gt;municipium&lt;/a&gt; in Campania, but whether the name merely indicated the origin of the family, or whether the first who bore it derived it from having conquered the town of Cales is uncertain, though the latter is the more profitable supposition. The name occurs on a coin of the Fufia gens. \"Geminus\" is a common surname meaning \"twin.\""
