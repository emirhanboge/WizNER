    "text": "Disco Bill (1977) is an album by &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Cosby\"&gt;Bill Cosby&lt;/a&gt;. It is his fifth, and last, musical comedy/parody album. As with \"&lt;a href=\"Bill%20Cosby%20Is%20Not%20Himself%20These%20Days\"&gt;Bill Cosby Is Not Himself These Days&lt;/a&gt;\", Cosby stated he improvised much of the material on the album; as its name implies, the album spoofs the &lt;a href=\"disco\"&gt;disco&lt;/a&gt; craze of the late 1970s."
