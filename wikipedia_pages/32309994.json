    "text": "Cedar College is an R-12 &lt;a href=\"Mixed-sex%20education\"&gt;co-educational&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Private%20school\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt; situated in the suburb of &lt;a href=\"Northgate%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Northgate, South Australia&lt;/a&gt;, 8\u00a0km north-east of the &lt;a href=\"Adelaide%2C%20Australia\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; CBD. Encompassing both Primary School and High School, Cedar College caters for students from Reception (Foundation) through to Year 12.\nSchool motto and name.\nA distinctly Christian school, the Cedar College Crest features the words \"Growing in &lt;a href=\"Wisdom\"&gt;Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;\" which reflects the desire of the school to encourage students to not only grow in &lt;a href=\"academic\"&gt;academic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"knowledge\"&gt;knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, but also to develop the wisdom to use this &lt;a href=\"knowledge\"&gt;knowledge&lt;/a&gt; in effective and God-honouring ways. It is derived from Psalm 92v12, which describes the growth of a &lt;a href=\"cedrus\"&gt;cedar tree&lt;/a&gt;, becoming strong, vital and fruit-bearing. In the same way, the name 'Cedar College' was chosen to reflect the purpose of the school.\nIn 2014, Cedar College launched its new purpose statement: \"Preparing students for real life\", which reflects the desire of the school to equip each student for their life ahead, by helping them to Discover &lt;a href=\"Jesus\"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt;, Display Love and Develop Self.\nCedar College is an inter-denominational &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; school and a ministry of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//cityreach.com.au\"&gt;CityReach Baptist Church (previously Oakden Baptist Church).&lt;/a&gt;\nHistory.\nDiscussions regarding the establishment of a &lt;a href=\"Christianity\"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; school in the inner north-eastern suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; first took place in May 1993. After three years of planning and preparation, Cedar College was officially opened on a newly acquired ten &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt; property in &lt;a href=\"Northgate%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Northgate&lt;/a&gt; in 1997. Established initially as a Primary School with just 34 students, Cedar College grew rapidly and soon opened the Middle School and Senior School campuses in the years that followed.\nCedar College opened a two-court sports stadium named the \"Cedar College Sports Centre\" in 2011. The centre was officially opened by the &lt;a href=\"Kate%20Ellis%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Hon. Kate Ellis MP&lt;/a&gt;, and has quickly become an important landmark and community facility in Northgate.\nIn 2013, the 2-storey Cedar College Resource Centre and Administration building was officially opened by the &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Pyne\"&gt;Hon. Christopher Pyne MP&lt;/a&gt;, Minister for Education. The Resource Centre features a distinctive triple-winged roof line, inspired by the historic &lt;a href=\"Vickers%20Vimy\"&gt;Vickers Vimy&lt;/a&gt; aircraft flown by &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Macpherson%20Smith\"&gt;Sir Keith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ross%20Macpherson%20Smith\"&gt;Ross Smith&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"England%20to%20Australia%20flight\"&gt;England to Australia in 1919&lt;/a&gt;, landing in the nearby Vickers Vimy Reserve. The Resource Centre is the new technology hub of the school, and adjoins the new Science wing, which was opened in 2014.\nIn 2016, during the school's 20th Anniversary year, Cedar College completed a new 2-storey Creative Arts Centre. The facility was officially opened by &lt;a href=\"David%20Fawcett\"&gt;Senator the Hon. David Fawcett MP&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of Education Minister &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Birmingham\"&gt;Senator the Hon. Simon Birmingham MP&lt;/a&gt;. The Creative Arts Centre features three classrooms and seven instrumental practice rooms on the Ground Floor with a Music performance space, recording studios, Drama performance space and theory classroom on the First Floor.\nDuring 2019, two of the original classrooms were demolished, to make way for a new &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; and learning support facility for the Primary School. The new, purpose-built facility, was opened in 2020. \nIn 2021, a new 2-Storey facility was opened in the High School, adjoining the &lt;a href=\"The%20arts\"&gt;Creative Arts&lt;/a&gt; Centre. This new building included new facilities for the \u2018Canopy\u2019 learning support program, as well as new High School classrooms.\nDepartments.\nToday, Cedar College is divided into three &lt;a href=\"Departmentalization\"&gt;departments&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Primary School (R-6), Middle School (7\u20139) and Senior School (10\u201312). The three separate departments enable the school to ensure that students develop academically and socially at an appropriate level, and provides families with a complete educational institution from Reception through to Year 12.\nWith now over 800 students, Cedar College is continuing to expand its facilities and curriculum, within a strong community environment.\nAlumni and Old Scholars Association.\nIn 2012, Cedar College launched its official &lt;a href=\"Alumni\"&gt;Alumni&lt;/a&gt; and Old Scholars Association \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.cedarcollege.sa.edu.au/old-scholars\"&gt;Branching Out\"&lt;/a&gt;, to celebrate 5 years of &lt;a href=\"graduates\"&gt;graduates&lt;/a&gt; from the school. Graduates and previous &lt;a href=\"scholars\"&gt;scholars&lt;/a&gt; of Cedar College may submit their current contact details and download the Alumni Newsletter via the school Website.\nService area.\nSituated 8 kilometres from the Adelaide CBD, amongst the growing suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Lightsview%2C%20South%20Australia\"&gt;Lightsview&lt;/a&gt; and Northgate, Cedar College is in a suitable location for students in the North-Eastern suburbs of &lt;a href=\"Adelaide\"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Australia\"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;."
