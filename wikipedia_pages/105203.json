    "text": "False Pass () is a city on &lt;a href=\"Unimak%20Island\"&gt;Unimak Island&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Aleutians%20East%20Borough%2C%20Alaska\"&gt;Aleutians East Borough&lt;/a&gt; of southwestern &lt;a href=\"Alaska\"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, United States. The population was 35 at the &lt;a href=\"2010%20United%20States%20Census\"&gt;2010 census&lt;/a&gt;, down from 64 in 2000. The 2018 estimate is 49.\nHistory.\nFalse Pass is an early English name for &lt;a href=\"Isanotski%20Strait\"&gt;Isanotski Strait&lt;/a&gt; on which the city of False Pass is located. The strait was called \"False Pass\" by early American sailing ship captains because it was thought to be impassable for their &lt;a href=\"Draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;deep draft&lt;/a&gt; vessels at the northern end. A salmon cannery was built on the Unimak Island side of the strait in 1919 which provided the nucleus for the modern settlement. A U.S. post office with the name of False Pass was established in 1921 which gave official status to the community.\nCommercial fishing for salmon, cod, halibut and crab continues to be the core of the community's lifestyle and economy.\nGeography.\nFalse Pass is at (54.827886, -163.399090). It is near the eastern end of &lt;a href=\"Unimak%20Island\"&gt;Unimak Island&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Aleutian%20Islands\"&gt;Aleutian Islands&lt;/a&gt; chain. Part of the city (26.093\u00a0km2, or 10.075 sq mi) is on the mainland's westernmost tip &lt;a href=\"Alaska%20Peninsula\"&gt;Alaska Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, across the &lt;a href=\"Isanotski%20Strait\"&gt;Isanotski Strait&lt;/a&gt; (about 600 meters at the closest point), although that section is nearly unpopulated. The city boundaries include the abandoned villages of Morzhovoi and Ikatan.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Census%20Bureau\"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (60.63%) is water.\nTransportation.\nBoats and aircraft are the only transportation to and from False Pass. Aircraft use &lt;a href=\"False%20Pass%20Airport\"&gt;False Pass Airport&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemographics.\nFalse Pass first appeared on the 1930 U.S. Census as the unincorporated area of \"Unimak.\" This included the populations of both False Pass and Ikatan. It reported again in 1940, but in 1950, was returned separately as False Pass (as an unincorporated village). It was made a census-designated place in 1980.\n2000 Census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 64 people, 22 households, and 13 families residing in the city.

The community has traditionally depended upon commercial fishing, but it now employs only 24% of the workforce or 10 individuals. These individuals are boat captains and crewmen. As in many modern American communities, white collar sales/office and management positions now employ 51% of the employment positions or 21 people.\nEducation.\n&lt;a href=\"Aleutians%20East%20Borough%20School%20District\"&gt;Aleutians East Borough School District&lt;/a&gt; (AEBSD) operates the False Pass School.\nCirca 1978 the school, then a part of the &lt;a href=\"Aleutian%20Region%20School%20District\"&gt;Aleutian Region School District&lt;/a&gt;, had a single teacher, and 8 students."
