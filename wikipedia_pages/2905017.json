    "text": "A paid or incentivized survey is a type of &lt;a href=\"statistical%20survey\"&gt;statistical survey&lt;/a&gt; where the participants/members are rewarded through an incentive program, generally entry into a &lt;a href=\"sweepstakes\"&gt;sweepstakes&lt;/a&gt; program or a small cash reward, for completing one or more surveys.\nDetails.\nA paid survey is used to collect quantitative information about the participants' personal and economic habits set against their particular &lt;a href=\"demographic\"&gt;demographic&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegitimate surveys are usually unpaid (as with a &lt;a href=\"Gallup%20poll\"&gt;Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt;) or incentivized. Surveys where the respondent must pay or purchase products to join a panel are generally scams, as are sites that disappear before paying the participants. Legitimate surveys do not need &lt;a href=\"credit%20card\"&gt;credit card&lt;/a&gt; information from respondents. "
