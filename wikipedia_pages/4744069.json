    "text": "Lexiko was a &lt;a href=\"word%20game\"&gt;word game&lt;/a&gt; invented by &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20Mosher%20Butts\"&gt;Alfred Butts&lt;/a&gt;. It was a precursor of \"&lt;a href=\"Scrabble\"&gt;Scrabble&lt;/a&gt;\". The name comes from the &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; , meaning \"of or for words\".\n\"Lexiko\" was played with a set of 100 square cardboard tiles, with the same letter distribution later used by \"Scrabble\" (see &lt;a href=\"Scrabble%20letter%20distributions\"&gt;Scrabble letter distributions&lt;/a&gt;), but no board. Players drew nine tiles at random, and attempted to construct words from them.\nHistory.\nIn 1931, Butts wrote a paper entitled \"Study of Games.\" In his paper, he described three categories of games: &lt;a href=\"Board%20game\"&gt;board&lt;/a&gt;, number games using &lt;a href=\"playing%20cards\"&gt;playing cards&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dice\"&gt;dice&lt;/a&gt;, and letter games (or games that fell into more than one). He noted that, although the most popular games were of the first two (e.g., &lt;a href=\"chess\"&gt;chess&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"backgammon\"&gt;backgammon&lt;/a&gt;), the best letter game readily available was &lt;a href=\"Anagrams%20%28game%29\"&gt;Anagrams&lt;/a&gt;. Around that time, he was reading \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gold-Bug\"&gt;The Gold-Bug&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Edgar%20Allan%20Poe\"&gt;Edgar Allan Poe&lt;/a&gt; and noticed a line containing the &lt;a href=\"English%20language\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; letter distribution. This gave him an epiphany: Anagrams would be more fun if the most common letters in English were more common in the game. He carefully analyzed letter frequencies in newspapers and other printed works to determine the ideal letter distribution for the game. With a few other changes, he named his project \"Lexiko\". The &lt;a href=\"game%20design\"&gt;game design&lt;/a&gt; was rejected by games manufacturers such as &lt;a href=\"Parker%20Brothers\"&gt;Parker Brothers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Bradley%20Company\"&gt;Milton Bradley&lt;/a&gt;, but Butts was able to sell copies on his own, though not enough to recoup his development expenses. In 1938, he began work on a &lt;a href=\"board%20game\"&gt;board game&lt;/a&gt; based on \"Lexiko\", which he called \"Criss-Cross Words\", which was eventually renamed \"&lt;a href=\"Scrabble\"&gt;Scrabble&lt;/a&gt;\"."
