This has echoes of the king's sufficiency theory, and I hope the film will bring it home to the audience,\" Pen-ek said.\nAlso in 2007, Pen-ek was invited by the &lt;a href=\"Toronto%20Reel%20Asian%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Toronto Reel Asian International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; to present two of his short films, \"Total Bangkok\" and \"Twelve Twenty\", as well as a collection of his commercials, in a program called \"Total Pen-Ek\".\nHis 2011 film \"&lt;a href=\"Headshot%20%282011%20film%29\"&gt;Headshot&lt;/a&gt;\" was selected as the Thai entry for the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film\"&gt;Best Foreign Language Oscar&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"85th%20Academy%20Awards\"&gt;85th Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt;, but it did not make the final shortlist."
