    "text": "Martin John O'Connor (born 10 December 1967) is a &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; coach and former professional player. Born in England, he represented the &lt;a href=\"Cayman%20Islands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Cayman Islands&lt;/a&gt; at international level.\nClub career.\nO'Connor was a late entrant to senior football. He joined &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;Southern League Premier Division&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href=\"Bromsgrove%20Rovers%20F.C.\"&gt;Bromsgrove Rovers&lt;/a&gt; in his early 20s, and played his part in their winning the &lt;a href=\"1991%E2%80%9392%20Southern%20Football%20League\"&gt;1991\u201392 title&lt;/a&gt;. He signed for &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.\"&gt;Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt; for a \u00a325,000 fee ahead of the &lt;a href=\"1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League\"&gt;inaugural Premier League season&lt;/a&gt;, but never appeared in that league. Instead, he made his &lt;a href=\"English%20Football%20League\"&gt;Football League&lt;/a&gt; debut at the age of 25 during the first of three spells at &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20F.C.\"&gt;Walsall&lt;/a&gt;, joining on loan in March 1993 before signing permanently the following year. He played a key role in the Saddlers winning promotion to &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20Second%20Division\"&gt;Division Two&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1994%E2%80%9395%20Football%20League%23Third%20Division\"&gt;1994\u201395&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe then joined &lt;a href=\"Peterborough%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Peterborough United&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Birmingham City&lt;/a&gt;, whom O'Connor represented in the &lt;a href=\"2001%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final\"&gt;2001 Football League Cup Final&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Liverpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;, which Birmingham lost in a &lt;a href=\"Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29\"&gt;penalty shootout&lt;/a&gt;.\nO'Connor re-joined Walsall in 2002, but his contract was not renewed at the end of the 2002\u201303 season. He then signed for &lt;a href=\"Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Shrewsbury Town&lt;/a&gt; in July 2003, before ending his playing career with &lt;a href=\"Kidderminster%20Harriers%20F.C.\"&gt;Kidderminster Harriers&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was &lt;a href=\"player-manager\"&gt;player-manager&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Halesowen%20Town%20F.C.\"&gt;Halesowen Town&lt;/a&gt; from November 2006 until October 2007. On 20 January 2009, he was named assistant manager to &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Hutchings\"&gt;Chris Hutchings&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Walsall%20F.C.\"&gt;Walsall&lt;/a&gt;, but the pair were sacked on 3 January 2011 after a series of poor results left Walsall bottom of &lt;a href=\"Football%20League%20One\"&gt;Football League One&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Dean%20Keates\"&gt;Dean Keates&lt;/a&gt; was sacked as Walsall manager in April 2019 with the team in the relegation places, O'Connor was appointed for the remaining five matches of &lt;a href=\"2018%E2%80%9319%20Walsall%20F.C.%20season\"&gt;the season&lt;/a&gt;. Despite overseeing a stunning 3\u20130 victory against &lt;a href=\"Peterborough%20United\"&gt;Peterborough United&lt;/a&gt; on 27 April 2019 taking the fight for survival to the last game of the season, O'Connor ultimately could not stop the Saddlers' relegation to &lt;a href=\"League%20Two\"&gt;League Two&lt;/a&gt;. O'Connor was succeeded as Walsall manager by &lt;a href=\"Darrell%20Clarke\"&gt;Darrell Clarke&lt;/a&gt; who signed a three-year contract on 10 May 2019.\nInternational career.\nO'Connor was called up to the &lt;a href=\"Cayman%20Islands%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Cayman Islands national football team&lt;/a&gt; in 2000; his father was born in that country. He played twice before &lt;a href=\"FIFA\"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; ruled that neither he nor many others who had been invited were eligible. The Cayman Islands had been attempting to exploit their status as a &lt;a href=\"British%20Overseas%20Territory\"&gt;British Overseas Territory&lt;/a&gt; by picking British passport holders who would not ordinarily be eligible to play for them.\nHonours.\nWalsall"
