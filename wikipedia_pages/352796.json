    "text": "Porto Velho (, \"Old Port\") is the &lt;a href=\"capital%20%28political%29\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"States%20of%20Brazil\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rond%C3%B4nia\"&gt;Rond\u00f4nia&lt;/a&gt;, in the upper &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20River\"&gt;Amazon River&lt;/a&gt; basin, and a Catholic Metropolitan Archbishopric. The population is 539,354 people (as of the &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Institute%20of%20Geography%20and%20Statistics\"&gt;IBGE&lt;/a&gt; 2020 estimation). Located on the &lt;a href=\"border\"&gt;border&lt;/a&gt; of Rond\u00f4nia and the state of &lt;a href=\"Amazonas%20State%2C%20Brazil\"&gt;Amazonas&lt;/a&gt;, the town is an important trading center for &lt;a href=\"cassiterite\"&gt;cassiterite&lt;/a&gt;, the mining of which represents the most important economic activity in the &lt;a href=\"region\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a transportation and communication center. It is on the eastern shore of the &lt;a href=\"Madeira%20River\"&gt;Madeira River&lt;/a&gt;, one of the main &lt;a href=\"tributary\"&gt;tributaries&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20River\"&gt;Amazon River&lt;/a&gt;. It is also Rond\u00f4nia's largest city, and the largest state capital of Brazil by area.\nThe municipality occupies most of the border between Amazonas and Rond\u00f4nia, and is both the westernmost and northernmost city in the state.\nHistory.\nOfficially founded on October 2, 1914, Porto Velho was founded by pioneers around 1907, during the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Madeira-Mamor%C3%A9%20Railroad\"&gt;Madeira-Mamor\u00e9 railroad&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"railroad\"&gt;railroad&lt;/a&gt; was completed, the local population was about one thousand inhabitants; its buildings were chiefly the railway's installations and the wooden houses of the &lt;a href=\"Caribbean\"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; (mainly &lt;a href=\"Barbadian%20people\"&gt;Barbadian&lt;/a&gt;) workers - hence the name of the town's largest district by then, \"Bajan Hill\" or \"Barbados Town\", nowadays called the \"Alto do Bode\".\nDuring the first sixty years, the city's &lt;a href=\"Urban%20planning\"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; was directly connected to the railway's activities. The town prospered during the &lt;a href=\"Natural%20rubber\"&gt;rubber&lt;/a&gt; boom, but then when low-cost &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;n rubber made rubber from the &lt;a href=\"Amazon%20Basin\"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; uncompetitive, the region's &lt;a href=\"Economics\"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt; ground to a halt. Cities like &lt;a href=\"Santo%20Ant%C3%B4nio%20do%20Madeira\"&gt;Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Madeira&lt;/a&gt;, which had a &lt;a href=\"tram\"&gt;tram&lt;/a&gt; line and a weekly &lt;a href=\"newspaper\"&gt;newspaper&lt;/a&gt; by the time of Porto Velho's foundation, are nothing but ruins nowadays.\nPorto Velho's survival is associated with the better conditions of the area where it was built, its easy access by the river and its harbor: these were all considerations in the choice of Porto Velho as the capital of the newly formed Federal &lt;a href=\"Territory%20%28country%20subdivision%29\"&gt;Territory&lt;/a&gt; of Guapor\u00e9, in 1943. Only with the beginning of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; was there another cycle of progress in the region. When the &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied forces&lt;/a&gt; lost control over the Malaysian rubber, Amazon's was needed due to the &lt;a href=\"war%20effort\"&gt;war effort&lt;/a&gt;. This produced what is known in Brazil as the \"second &lt;a href=\"rubber%20boom\"&gt;rubber boom&lt;/a&gt;\". But when the war ended, the region's economy once again came to a halt.\nPorto Velho's modern &lt;a href=\"history\"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; begins with the discovery of &lt;a href=\"cassiterite\"&gt;cassiterite&lt;/a&gt; around the city, and of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Madeira%20River\"&gt;Madeira River&lt;/a&gt;, at the end of the 1950s. In addition, the government's decision to allow large cattle farms in the territory began a trend of migration into the city. Almost one million people moved to Rond\u00f4nia, and Porto Velho's population increased to three hundred thousand. This intense migration caused much trouble for the city. Among many other problems, the suburban boroughs, for example, are nothing but &lt;a href=\"shanty%20town\"&gt;shanty town&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIts &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Heart%20of%20Jesus%20Cathedral%2C%20Porto%20Velho\"&gt;Catedral Metropolitana Sagrado Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Jesus&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href=\"cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; archiepiscopal see of a Latin Catholic jurisdiction that started on May 1, 1925 as the vast Amazonian &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20Prelature%20of%20Porto%20Velho\"&gt;Territorial Prelature of Porto Velho&lt;/a&gt; on territories split off from the then &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Amazonas\"&gt;Diocese of Amazonas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20S%C3%A3o%20Lu%C3%ADz%20de%20C%C3%A1ceres\"&gt;Diocese of S\u00e3o Lu\u00edz de C\u00e1ceres&lt;/a&gt; and lost parts of it to three new &lt;a href=\"Territorial%20prelature\"&gt;Territorial prelature&lt;/a&gt;s before being promoted first bishopric (Diocese of Porto Velho) and on October 4, 1982 promoted as Metropolitan &lt;a href=\"Archdiocese%20of%20Porto%20Velho\"&gt;Archdiocese of Porto Velho&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nPorto Velho features a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20monsoon%20climate\"&gt;tropical monsoon climate&lt;/a&gt; (climate type \"Am\") under the &lt;a href=\"K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification\"&gt;K\u00f6ppen climate classification&lt;/a&gt;. The temperatures tend to be relatively consistent throughout the course of the year, with average daily temperatures typically between 25 and 26 degrees Celsius. The dry season is short and covers the months of June, July and August. Porto Velho is particularly wet from November through April, averaging roughly of rain per month in each of these months. According to the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), between 1961 and 1990 the lowest temperature recorded in Porto Velho was in July 1975, and the highest reached in August 1969.\nVegetation.\nThe Amazon has over half of the planet's remaining &lt;a href=\"rainforest\"&gt;rainforest&lt;/a&gt;s and is the largest and most species-rich tract of &lt;a href=\"tropical%20rainforest\"&gt;tropical rainforest&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;, and tropical forests in the &lt;a href=\"Americas\"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt; are consistently more species-rich than wet forests in &lt;a href=\"Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Asia\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;. As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled &lt;a href=\"biodiversity\"&gt;biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore than one third of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest.\nConservation.\nThe municipality contains what is left of the &lt;a href=\"Rio%20Madeira%20Sustainable%20Yield%20Forest\"&gt;Rio Madeira Sustainable Yield Forest&lt;/a&gt; (B) and (C), created in 1990.\nIt contains the &lt;a href=\"Lago%20do%20Cuni%C3%A3%20Extractive%20Reserve\"&gt;Lago do Cuni\u00e3 Extractive Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, created in 1999.\nIt contains part of the strictly-protected &lt;a href=\"Cuni%C3%A3%20Ecological%20Station\"&gt;Cuni\u00e3 Ecological Station&lt;/a&gt;, an area of savannah parkland.\nIt holds all of the strictly protected &lt;a href=\"Serra%20dos%20Tr%C3%AAs%20Irm%C3%A3os%20Ecological%20Station\"&gt;Serra dos Tr\u00eas Irm\u00e3os Ecological Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt contains part of the &lt;a href=\"Mapinguari%20National%20Park\"&gt;Mapinguari National Park&lt;/a&gt;, a conservation unit created in 2008.\nIt also contains part of the &lt;a href=\"Jacund%C3%A1%20National%20Forest\"&gt;Jacund\u00e1 National Forest&lt;/a&gt;, a sustainable use conservation unit.\nThe municipality contains 66% of the &lt;a href=\"Jaci%20Paran%C3%A1%20Extractive%20Reserve\"&gt;Jaci Paran\u00e1 Extractive Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, created in 1996.\nIt contains the &lt;a href=\"Mujica%20Nava%20Ecological%20Station\"&gt;Mujica Nava Ecological Station&lt;/a&gt;, created in 1996.\nIt contains part of the &lt;a href=\"Bom%20Futuro%20National%20Forest\"&gt;Bom Futuro National Forest&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1988.\nThe majority of the forest surrounding Porto Velho has been cut down, however.\nEconomy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"GDP\"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt; for the city was R$3,656,512,000 (2005).\nThe &lt;a href=\"per%20capita%20income\"&gt;per capita income&lt;/a&gt; for the city was R$9,779 (2005).\nTransportation.\nInternational Airport.\n&lt;a href=\"Governador%20Jorge%20Teixeira%20de%20Oliveira%20International%20Airport\"&gt;Porto Velho International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, 7\u00a0km from the city, has its main access at the Av.
