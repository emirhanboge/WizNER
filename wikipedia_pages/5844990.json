    "text": "Vera; or, The Nihilists is a &lt;a href=\"Play%20%28theatre%29\"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20Wilde\"&gt;Oscar Wilde&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=\"tragedy\"&gt;tragedy&lt;/a&gt; set in &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and is loosely based on the life of &lt;a href=\"Vera%20Zasulich\"&gt;Vera Zasulich&lt;/a&gt;. It was Wilde's first play, and the first to be performed. A draft of the script was completed in 1880 and the following year arrangements were made for a one-off staging in London with &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Bernard-Beere\"&gt;Mrs. Bernard-Beere&lt;/a&gt; in the title role, but the production was cancelled. The first performance was in 1883 at New York\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Union%20Square%20Theatre\"&gt;Union Square Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, and was based on revisions made by Wilde while lecturing in America in 1882. The play, which starred Marie Prescott as Vera, was not a success and folded after only one week. It is rarely revived.\nProduction history.\nAt the time of writing, the reform-minded Tsar &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia\"&gt;Alexander II&lt;/a&gt; was involved in a struggle with revolutionaries who sought to assassinate him (and eventually succeeded). Though none of Wilde's characters correspond to actual Russian people of the time, the above situation was well-known both to Wilde and to the audience for which he was writing. It has been suggested that the plot was inspired by true events. In 1878, three years before the play's completion, &lt;a href=\"Vera%20Zasulich\"&gt;Vera Zasulich&lt;/a&gt; shot the Governor of &lt;a href=\"St%20Petersburg\"&gt;St Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fyodor%20Trepov%20%28senior%29\"&gt;Trepov&lt;/a&gt;. Wilde described himself as a Socialist, although Ellmann describes his Socialism as more \"a general hatred of tyranny\" than a specific political belief.\nMarie Prescott and her husband, Mr Perzel purchased the rights to perform the play, and she was the leading actress in its first performance at the Union Square Theatre. Wilde travelled to America for the second time in his life specifically to oversee the production.\nThe play was withdrawn after one week. Mr Perzel stated to newspapers \"the play is withdrawn simply because it did not pay,\" citing that he had lost $2,500 on the piece the previous week. He also implied that he had hoped Wilde himself would lecture between the acts, allowing him to capitalise on Wilde's popularity as a public speaker.\nPlot.\n\"Dramatis Personae\".\nPERSONS IN THE PROLOGUE.\nPERSONS IN THE PLAY.\n\"Nihilists.\"\nSoldiers, Conspirators, &amp;c.\nPrologue.\nVera is a barmaid in her father's tavern, which is situated along a road to the prison camps in &lt;a href=\"Siberia\"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;. A gang of prisoners stop at the tavern. Vera immediately recognises her brother Dmitri as one of the prisoners. He begs her to go to &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; and join the &lt;a href=\"Nihilist%20movement\"&gt;Nihilists&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"terrorism\"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; group trying to assassinate the &lt;a href=\"Czar\"&gt;Czar&lt;/a&gt;, and avenge his imprisonment. She and her father's manservant Michael leave to join the Nihilists.\nAct I.\nFive years later, Vera has become the Nihilists' top &lt;a href=\"assassination\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;, and is wanted across Europe. She is in love with a fellow Nihilist named Alexis: however, Nihilists are sworn never to marry. A Nihilist meeting is nearly broken up by soldiers, but Alexis thwarts the soldiers by revealing his true identity: he is the &lt;a href=\"Tsarevich\"&gt;Tsarevich&lt;/a&gt;, heir to the Russian throne. This act earns him the further admiration of Vera and the hatred of the Nihilists.\nAct II.\nAt a council meeting, Tsar Ivan and his cruel &lt;a href=\"epigram\"&gt;epigram&lt;/a&gt;matic minister Prince Paul Maraloffski criticise Tsarevitch Alexis's &lt;a href=\"democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt; leanings, but the Tsar is assassinated by Michael after the Tsarevitch opens the window.\nAct III.\nAlexis ascends the throne and exiles Prince Paul Maraloffski, not to Siberia, but to &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. Maraloffski joins the Nihilists to kill Alexis. The task of assassinating the Tsar is given to Vera. She must infiltrate the palace, stab the Tsar and throw the &lt;a href=\"dagger\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt; out the window as a signal to Nihilist agents below. If she does not, the agents will break in and kill him. Vera is reluctant to kill the man she loves, though.\nAct IV.\nAlexis returns to the palace after his &lt;a href=\"coronation\"&gt;coronation&lt;/a&gt;, intending to end injustice in Russia during his reign. Vera enters the palace, knife at the ready. Alexis asks her to marry him. She accepts, but then she hears the agents outside crying out for the signal. She stabs herself and throws the dagger out the window, and the agents depart satisfied.\nCritical reception.\nThe play\u2019s original reception was mostly critical.\nReviewing the first production, the \"New York Mirror\" described it as \"among the highest order of plays,\" \"masterly,\" and \"the noblest contribution to its literature the stage has received in many years\". Other newspapers reviews were very critical: \"Long-drawn dramatic rot\" (\"New York Herald\"), \"wearisome\" (\"New York Times\"), and \"little better than fizzle\" (\"New York Tribune\"). \"Punch\" printed that it was \"from all accounts, except the Poet's own, Vera Bad\". Pilot, meanwhile, complimented the script, and laid blame on Prescott as an \"inferior actress\".\nSince its original production, \"Vera\" has been very rarely revived. In 1987, Wilde's biographer &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Ellmann\"&gt;Richard Ellmann&lt;/a&gt; described \"Vera\" as \"a wretched play,\" yet noted that \"it did not fall disastrously below the standard set by drama in a century when, as Stendhal said, plays could not be written.\""
