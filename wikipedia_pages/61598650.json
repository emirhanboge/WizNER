    "text": " known in Europe as Top Gear Rally 2, is a &lt;a href=\"Racing%20video%20game\"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt; video game developed by &lt;a href=\"Kemco\"&gt;Kemco&lt;/a&gt; and released for the &lt;a href=\"Game%20Boy%20Color\"&gt;Game Boy Color&lt;/a&gt; handheld console in 2000. It is a sequel to \"&lt;a href=\"Top%20Gear%20Pocket\"&gt;Top Gear Pocket&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGameplay.\n\"Top Gear Pocket 2\" is &lt;a href=\"racing%20video%20game\"&gt;racing video game&lt;/a&gt; where the player drives &lt;a href=\"Rallying\"&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; cars through closed-circuit courses. The player starts in the last position and must overtake a number of opponents controlled by the game's &lt;a href=\"Artificial%20intelligence%20in%20video%20games\"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; before crossing the finish line on the last lap. Points are awarded to the player depending o the position they finish a course. These can be used to buy or upgrade cars, which have four attributes: acceleration, top speed, handling, and braking. The game also includes a &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer%20video%20game\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; mode where two players can race against each other. The &lt;a href=\"Game%20Link%20Cable\"&gt;Game Link Cable&lt;/a&gt; is required for multiplayer.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"Top Gear Pocket 2\" was developed by &lt;a href=\"Kemco\"&gt;Kemco&lt;/a&gt; as a sequel to \"&lt;a href=\"Top%20Gear%20Pocket\"&gt;Top Gear Pocket&lt;/a&gt;\". The game uses an enhanced version of its predecessor's &lt;a href=\"Game%20engine\"&gt;engine&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike its predecessor, the game cartridge does not feature a built-in &lt;a href=\"Rumble%20Pak\"&gt;rumble&lt;/a&gt; feature, but includes a battery which allows players to &lt;a href=\"Saved%20game\"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt; their progress. \"Top Gear Pocket 2\" was released on February 1, 2000 in North America. In Europe, the game was released as \"Top Gear Rally 2\".\nReception.\n\"Top Gear Pocket 2\" received generally favorable reviews from video game publications. At the time of its release, \"&lt;a href=\"IGN\"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt;\" reviewer Craig Harris considered it one of the best racing games on the Game Boy Color, stating that the game had been \"tweaked and refined as a quality racing game\", and concluding that its increasing difficulty offers a proper challenge as players progress through the game. However, he criticized the multiplayer mode because of its \"catch-up\" feature, noting that the \"only real challenge is trying to keep behind the other person and guess when the final stretch approaches so you can win\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"AllGame\"&gt;AllGame&lt;/a&gt;\" criticized the car attributes for being unbalanced, noting that the top speed is the only one that has a significant impact on the gameplay, but still considered the game enjoyable to play due to its sensation of speed. The British video game magazine \"Planet Game Boy\" highlighted the game's speed and pace, especially as better cars are unlocked, while the Spanish official Nintendo magazine \"&lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Acci%C3%B3n\"&gt;Nintendo Acci\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;\" praised the graphic improvements over its predecessor, stating that the cars are more detailed and that sharp curves and elevation changes are better animated."
