    "text": "The mina (also m\u0115n\u0113, &lt;a href=\"Aramaic%20language\"&gt;Aramaic&lt;/a&gt;; ) is an ancient &lt;a href=\"Near%20East\"&gt;Near East&lt;/a&gt;ern unit of weight, which was divided into 60 &lt;a href=\"shekels\"&gt;shekels&lt;/a&gt;. The mina, like the shekel, was also a unit of &lt;a href=\"currency\"&gt;currency&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe word mina comes from the ancient &lt;a href=\"Semitic%20root\"&gt;Semitic root&lt;/a&gt; / 'to count', &lt;a href=\"Akkadian%20language\"&gt;Akkadian&lt;/a&gt; , (), / (/), (), . It is mentioned in the Bible, where Solomon is reported to have made 300 shields, each with 3 \"mina\" of gold (), or later after the Edict of &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20II%20of%20Persia\"&gt;Cyrus II of Persia&lt;/a&gt; the people are reported to have donated 5000 mina of silver for the reconstruction of &lt;a href=\"Solomon%27s%20Temple\"&gt;Solomon's Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jerusalem\"&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom earliest &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Sumer\"&gt;Sumerian&lt;/a&gt; times, a mina was a unit of weight. At first, talents and shekels had not yet been introduced. By the time of &lt;a href=\"Ur-Nammu\"&gt;Ur-Nammu&lt;/a&gt; (shortly before 2000 BCE), the mina had a value of &lt;a href=\"Talent%20%28weight%29\"&gt;talents&lt;/a&gt; as well as 60 &lt;a href=\"shekel\"&gt;shekel&lt;/a&gt;s. The weight of this mina is calculated at .\nWritings from &lt;a href=\"Ugarit\"&gt;Ugarit&lt;/a&gt; give the value of a mina as equivalent to fifty shekels. The prophet &lt;a href=\"Ezekiel\"&gt;Ezekiel&lt;/a&gt; refers to a mina (\"maneh\" in the &lt;a href=\"King%20James%20Version\"&gt;King James Version&lt;/a&gt;) also as 60 shekels, in the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Ezekiel\"&gt;Book of Ezekiel&lt;/a&gt; 45:12. &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20of%20Nazareth\"&gt;Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/a&gt; tells the \"&lt;a href=\"parable%20of%20the%20minas\"&gt;parable of the minas&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Gospel%20of%20Luke\"&gt;Luke&lt;/a&gt; 19:11\u201327, also told with the &lt;a href=\"Talent%20%28measurement%29\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt; unit of weight in &lt;a href=\"Gospel%20of%20Matthew\"&gt;Matthew&lt;/a&gt;. In Jewish usage, the is equal in weight to 100 .\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"Akkadian%20Empire\"&gt;Akkad&lt;/a&gt;ian period, 2 mina was equal to 1 of water (cf. &lt;a href=\"water%20clock\"&gt;clepsydra&lt;/a&gt;, water clock).\nIn &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Greece\"&gt;ancient Greece&lt;/a&gt;, it originally equalled 70 &lt;a href=\"drachmae\"&gt;drachmae&lt;/a&gt; and later was increased to 100 drachmae. The Greek word () was borrowed from Semitic; compare Hebrew , Aramaic , Syriac , Ugaritic , and Akkadian .\nThe Greek mina.\nThe Aeginetan mina weighed .\nThe Attic mina weighed ."
