    "text": "Elmers End is a railway station and tram terminus in &lt;a href=\"Elmers%20End\"&gt;Elmers End&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"south%20London\"&gt;south London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. It is in the &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Bromley\"&gt;London Borough of Bromley&lt;/a&gt; and on the railway it is down the line from .\nThe railway through Elmers End was opened by the &lt;a href=\"South%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28UK%29\"&gt;South Eastern Railway&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April 1864 as an extension of the &lt;a href=\"Mid-Kent%20Line\"&gt;Mid-Kent Line&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"New%20Beckenham%20railway%20station\"&gt;New Beckenham&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Addiscombe%20railway%20station\"&gt;Addiscombe&lt;/a&gt;; there was a &lt;a href=\"Hayes%20Line\"&gt;branch&lt;/a&gt;, opened on 29 May 1882 to &lt;a href=\"Hayes%20railway%20station\"&gt;Hayes&lt;/a&gt; at this station. The portion of the &lt;a href=\"Addiscombe%20Line\"&gt;line to Addiscombe&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally named \"Croydon (Addiscombe Road)\", was closed in 1997 when &lt;a href=\"Tramlink\"&gt;Tramlink&lt;/a&gt; took over much of the trackbed from Elmers End.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hayes%20line\"&gt;Hayes line&lt;/a&gt; service on the suburban commuter railway line between &lt;a href=\"Hayes%2C%20Bromley\"&gt;Hayes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"London%20Charing%20Cross\"&gt;London Charing Cross&lt;/a&gt; through Elmers End is still in use. The station is on Elmers End Road (A214), at the south-east corner of &lt;a href=\"South%20Norwood%20Country%20Park\"&gt;South Norwood Country Park&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne former &lt;a href=\"railway%20platform\"&gt;railway platform&lt;/a&gt; is now the terminus for &lt;a href=\"Tramlink\"&gt;Tramlink&lt;/a&gt; services to central &lt;a href=\"Croydon\"&gt;Croydon&lt;/a&gt;.\nWork is underway to open a second tram platform and double the tram line to Arena to increase capacity. As of March 2019, vegetation has been cleared to make way for the new line. The platform was due to open in December 2020, but has been delayed.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1857-1922).\nThe Mid Kent line was built by the Mid-Kent and North Kent Junction Railway (MK&amp;NKJR) and was opened on 1 January 1857 as far as Beckenham Junction. From opening the line was worked by the &lt;a href=\"South%20Eastern%20Railway%2C%20UK\"&gt;South Eastern Railway&lt;/a&gt; (SER).\nSeven years later the MK&amp;NKJR built an extension from a new junction station at New Beckenham to &lt;a href=\"Addiscombe\"&gt;Croydon (Addiscombe Road)&lt;/a&gt; with an intermediate station at Elmers End, which again was operated by the SER from opening. The station was occupied in what was then a rural area with scattered farm houses and hamlets. The station building was located on the down side whilst a goods yard was provided on the up side.\nBy 1914 Elmers End had almost become part of Beckenham on the east side of the railway. On the opposite side a sewage works, the Croydon Council refuse destructor, Beckenham Council's refuse destructor and electric power station as well as two brick works and Crystal Palace District Cemetery were all located. Sidings served the Croydon and Beckenham Council sites.\nThe station was rebuilt in 1881/2 in anticipation of the opening of the Hayes branch. Bay platforms were provided on the up and down side and a new 43 lever signal box was provided immediately south of the station. New coal sidings, in anticipation of further suburban growth, were also provided on the up side.\nThe Elmers End \u2013 Hayes section was built by the West Wickham &amp; Hayes Railway, and left the existing line just south of the station on a tight 13 chain curve. It was sold to the South Eastern Railway in 1881 and opened on 29 May 1882. Initially 13 services each way were operated between Elmers End and Hayes with central London passengers having to change trains.\nIn 1898 the South Eastern Railway and its bitter rivals the London Chatham and Dover Railway agreed to work as one railway company under the name of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Eastern%20and%20Chatham%20Railway\"&gt;South Eastern and Chatham Railway&lt;/a&gt; and Elmers End became an SECR station.\nSouthern Railway (1923-1947).\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Railways%20Act%201921\"&gt;Railways Act 1921&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the Grouping Act), Elmers End became a &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29\"&gt;Southern Railway&lt;/a&gt; station on 1 January 1923.\nThe Mid-Kent line was &lt;a href=\"Railway%20electrification%20in%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;electrified&lt;/a&gt; with the (750 V DC third rail) system and electric services commenced on 28 February 1926. Early electric services were worked by early Southern Railway 3-car Electric Multiple Unit trains often built from old SECR carriages. In connection with the electrification the track bed between Elmers End and Clock House area was raised in an effort to reduce flooding. Electrification led to further house building between Clock House and Elmers End stations.\nDuring World War 2 the station was hit three times by bombs during 1941. Some track alterations took place in 1947 which included the link between the Up Bay and Hayes line being removed, platform lengthening and direct access from the Hayes branch to the down bay.\nBritish Railways (1948-1994).\nAfter World War II and following nationalisation on 1 January 1948, the station fell under the auspices of &lt;a href=\"British%20Rail\"&gt;British Rail&lt;/a&gt;ways Southern Region. Three-aspect colour light signals were installed at the station in 1956.\nThe goods yard was closed on 6 May 1963.\nThe station building was destroyed by fire on 16 December 1973\nOn 28 May 1975 all signalling came under the control of the London Bridge Signalling Centre and the 1882 signal box was closed. The down bay was taken out of passenger use and became an engineer's siding.\nUpon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: &lt;a href=\"InterCity%20%28British%20Rail%29\"&gt;InterCity&lt;/a&gt;, operating principal express services; and London &amp; South East (renamed &lt;a href=\"Network%20SouthEast\"&gt;Network SouthEast&lt;/a&gt; in 1986) who operated commuter services in the London area.\nServices to &lt;a href=\"Sanderstead%20railway%20station\"&gt;Sanderstead&lt;/a&gt; ceased in May 1983 with closure of the &lt;a href=\"Woodside%20and%20South%20Croydon%20Joint%20Railway\"&gt;Woodside and South Croydon Joint Railway&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe privatisation era (1994-Present Day).\nFollowing privatisation of British Rail on 1 April 1994 the infrastructure at Elmers End station became the responsibility of &lt;a href=\"Railtrack\"&gt;Railtrack&lt;/a&gt; whilst a business unit operated the train services. On 13 October 1996 operation of the passenger services passed to &lt;a href=\"Connex%20South%20Eastern\"&gt;Connex South Eastern&lt;/a&gt; who were originally due to run the franchise until 2011.\nIn 1997 the line to Addiscombe closed \u2013 up to this point it was generally worked by a 2-car EMU connecting to and from Hayes services. The section to Woodside and part of the former route to Selsdon re-opened in 2000 as part of the &lt;a href=\"Tramlink\"&gt;Croydon Tramlink&lt;/a&gt; network.\nFollowing a number of accidents and financial issues Railtrack plc was sold to &lt;a href=\"Network%20Rail\"&gt;Network Rail&lt;/a&gt; on 3 October 2002 who became responsible for the infrastructure.\nOn 27 June 2003 the &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20Rail%20Authority\"&gt;Strategic Rail Authority&lt;/a&gt; decided to strip Connex of the franchise citing poor financial management and run the franchise itself. Connex South Eastern continued to operate the franchise until 8 November 2003 with the services transferring to the &lt;a href=\"Strategic%20Rail%20Authority\"&gt;Strategic Rail Authority's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"South%20Eastern%20Trains\"&gt;South Eastern Trains&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary the following day.\nOn 30 November 2005 the &lt;a href=\"Department%20for%20Transport\"&gt;Department for Transport&lt;/a&gt; awarded &lt;a href=\"Govia\"&gt;Govia&lt;/a&gt; the Integrated Kent franchise. The services operated by South Eastern Trains transferred to &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20%28train%20operating%20company%29\"&gt;Southeastern&lt;/a&gt; on 1 April 2006.\nServices.\nNational Rail.\n&lt;a href=\"National%20Rail\"&gt;National Rail&lt;/a&gt; services at Elmers End are operated by &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20%28train%20operating%20company%29\"&gt;Southeastern&lt;/a&gt; using , , and &lt;a href=\"Electric%20multiple%20unit\"&gt;EMUs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:\nOn Sundays, there is a half-hourly service between London Cannon Street and Hayes.\nLondon Trams.\n&lt;a href=\"Tramlink\"&gt;London Trams&lt;/a&gt; also operate services at Elmers End. Trams run every 10 minutes Monday-Saturday and every 15 minutes on Sundays to &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%20station\"&gt;Wimbledon&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Croydon\"&gt;Croydon Town Centre&lt;/a&gt;.\nConnections.\n&lt;a href=\"London%20Buses\"&gt;London Buses&lt;/a&gt; routes &lt;a href=\"London%20Buses%20route%2054\"&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London%20Buses%20route%20356\"&gt;356&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"London%20Buses%20route%20289\"&gt;289&lt;/a&gt; serve the station from the adjacent Elmers End Interchange."
