    "text": "Michael Fennelly (born 28 February 1985) is an Irish &lt;a href=\"hurling\"&gt;hurler&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"National%20Hurling%20League\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;championship&lt;/a&gt; career with the &lt;a href=\"Kilkenny%20GAA\"&gt;Kilkenny&lt;/a&gt; senior team lasted twelve seasons from 2006 until 2017.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Ballyhale\"&gt;Ballyhale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Kilkenny\"&gt;County Kilkenny&lt;/a&gt;, Fennelly was brought up in a family that had a strong association with hurling. His grandfather, &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Fennelly%20%28senior%29\"&gt;Kevin Fennely, Snr&lt;/a&gt;, played with Kilkenny in the 1940s, while his uncles - &lt;a href=\"Brendan%20Fennelly\"&gt;Brendan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ger%20Fennelly\"&gt;Ger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Fennelly\"&gt;Kevin, Jnr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Fennelly\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Se%C3%A1n%20Fennelly\"&gt;Se\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; - all played for Kilkenny from the 1970s until the 1990s\nFennelly first played competitive hurling at juvenile and underage levels with the &lt;a href=\"Ballyhale%20Shamrocks\"&gt;Ballyhale Shamrocks&lt;/a&gt; club. After much success in these grades he later won three &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Senior%20Club%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland&lt;/a&gt; medals with the club's senior team. He has also won four &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Senior%20Club%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; medals and six &lt;a href=\"Kilkenny%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;county senior championship&lt;/a&gt; medals.\nFennelly made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of eighteen when he was selected for the Kilkenny minor team. He enjoyed one championship season with the minor team, culminating with an &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Minor%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland&lt;/a&gt; medal. Fennelly subsequently joined the Kilkenny under-21 team, winning &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland&lt;/a&gt; medals in 2004 and 2006. By this stage he had also joined the Kilkenny senior team, making his debut during the &lt;a href=\"2006%20National%20Hurling%20League\"&gt;2006 league&lt;/a&gt;. Over the course of the next twelve seasons, Fennelly won eight &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland&lt;/a&gt; medals, including a record-equalling four championships in-a-row from 2006 to 2009, followed by back-to-back triumphs in 2011 and 2012 and a final two championships in 2014 and 2015. The All-Ireland-winning captain of 2009, he was denied a ninth All-Ireland medal in September 2016. Fennelly also won nine &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; medals, five &lt;a href=\"National%20Hurling%20League\"&gt;National Hurling League&lt;/a&gt; medals and was named &lt;a href=\"Vodafone%20Hurler%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Texaco%20Hurler%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;Texaco Hurler of the Year&lt;/a&gt; in 2011. He was later joined on the Kilkenny team by his brother &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Fennelly\"&gt;Colin&lt;/a&gt;. Fennelly announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 29 December 2017 and from club hurling on 28 May 2020.\nPlaying career.\nClub.\nAfter much success at underage levels, including four successive under-21 championships, Fennelly quickly joined the Ballyhale Shamrocks senior team. Two years later he was deployed further out the field as Ballyhale faced &lt;a href=\"O%27Loughlin%20Gaels%20GAA\"&gt;O'Loughlin Gaels&lt;/a&gt; in the senior decider. An impressive 1\u201322 to 2\u201311 victory gave Fennelly his first &lt;a href=\"Kilkenny%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;championship&lt;/a&gt; medal. He later added a &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Senior%20Club%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; medal to his collection when Ballyhale secured a comprehensive 1\u201320 to 1\u20138 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Birr%20GAA\"&gt;Birr&lt;/a&gt; to take the provincial title for the first time in seventeen years. On 17 March 2007 Ballyhale Shamrocks faced &lt;a href=\"Loughrea%20GAA\"&gt;Loughrea&lt;/a&gt; in the All-Ireland decider. On a day when &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Shefflin\"&gt;Henry Shefflin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cha%20Fitzpatrick\"&gt;James \"Cha\" Fitzpatrick&lt;/a&gt; were held scoreless, the three Reid brothers contributed 3\u20137 from play. A 3\u201312 to 2\u20138 victory gave Fennelly an &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Senior%20Club%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship&lt;/a&gt; medal.\nFennelly added a second championship medal to his collection in 2007 following a 1\u201320 to 1\u201310 drubbing of &lt;a href=\"St%20Martin%27s%20GAA%20%28County%20Kilkenny%29\"&gt;St. Martin's&lt;/a&gt;.\nBallyhale Shamrocks made it three-in-a-row in 2008. A 2\u201311 to 0\u201312 defeat of &lt;a href=\"James%20Stephens%20GAA\"&gt;James Stephens&lt;/a&gt; gave Fennelly a third successive championship medal. He later won a second Leinster medal as the Shamrocks defeated reigning champions Birr by 2\u201313 to 1\u201311.\nFennelly won a fourth successive championship medal in 2009, as Ballyhale claimed a record-equaling four-in-a-row following a 1\u201314 to 1\u201311 defeat of James Stephens once again. The subsequent provincial decider saw Ballyhale hit fifteen wides, however, Fennelly still collected a third Leinster medal following a 1\u201316 to 1\u20138 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Tullamore%20GAA\"&gt;Tullamore&lt;/a&gt;. On 17 March 2010 Ballyhale faced three-in-a-row &lt;a href=\"Portumna%20GAA\"&gt;Portumna&lt;/a&gt; in a \"dream\" All-Ireland decider. The game failed to live up to the billing, however, 1\u201319 to 0\u201317 victory gave Fennelly a second All-Ireland medal.\nFive-in-a-row proved beyond Ballyhale Shamrocks, however, the team bounced back in 2012 having lost the championship decider the previous year. A far from vintage 0\u201316 to 0\u201312 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Dicksboro%20GAA\"&gt;Dicksboro&lt;/a&gt; gave Fennelly a fifth championship medal.\nFennelly won a sixth championship medal in 2014 as the Shamrocks claimed a 1\u201320 to 1\u201313 defeat of reigning champions &lt;a href=\"Clara%20GAA\"&gt;Clara&lt;/a&gt;. Fennelly later collected a fourth Leinster medal as veteran Henry Shefflin proved the difference in a 0\u201321 to 1\u201314 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Kilcormac/Killoughey%20GAA\"&gt;Kilcormacv/Killoughey&lt;/a&gt;. On 17 March 2015 Ballyhale faced &lt;a href=\"Kilmallock%20GAA\"&gt;Kilmallock&lt;/a&gt; in the All-Ireland decider. A complete mismatch saw Shamrocks win the game by 1\u201318 to 1\u20136, with Fennelly collecting a third All-Ireland medal.\nMinor and under-21.\nFennelly first played for &lt;a href=\"Kilkenny%20GAA\"&gt;Kilkenny&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the minor team during the &lt;a href=\"2003%20All-Ireland%20Minor%20Hurling%20Championship%23Leinster%20Minor%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;2003 Leinster Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He made his first appearance for the team on 25 June 2003 when he lined out at midfield in a 4-12 to 0-11 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Dublin%20GAA\"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;. Fennelly was retained at midfield when Kilkenny qualified to play &lt;a href=\"Offaly%20GAA\"&gt;Offaly&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20All-Ireland%20Minor%20Hurling%20Championship%23Leinster%20Minor%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Leinster final&lt;/a&gt; on 6 July 2003. He was held scoreless throughout the game but ended with a &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;winners' medal&lt;/a&gt; after an 0-18 to 0-13 victory. On 14 September 2003, Fennelly was again selected at midfield when Kilkenny faced &lt;a href=\"Galway%20GAA\"&gt;Galway&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2003%20All-Ireland%20Minor%20Hurling%20Championship%23All-Ireland%20Minor%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland final&lt;/a&gt;. He was once again held scoreless but claimed an &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Minor%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland&lt;/a&gt; medal following the 2-16 to 2-15 victory.\nFennelly was just out of the minor grade when he was drafted onto the Kilkenny under-21 team before the &lt;a href=\"2004%20All-Ireland%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship%23Leinster%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;2004 Leinster Championship&lt;/a&gt;. He made his first appearance in the grade on 2 June 2004 in a 0-20 to 2-10 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Laois%20GAA\"&gt;Laois&lt;/a&gt;. On 14 July 2004, Fennelly won a &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Leinster Championship&lt;/a&gt; medal after lining out at left corner-back in a 1-16 to 2-03 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Wexford%20GAA\"&gt;Wexford&lt;/a&gt; in the final. He retained his position at left corner-back when Kilkenny qualified for the &lt;a href=\"2004%20All-Ireland%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship%20Final\"&gt;All-Ireland final&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Tipperary%20GAA\"&gt;Tipperary&lt;/a&gt;. Fennelly ended the game with a &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;winners' medal&lt;/a&gt; following a 3-21 to 1-06 victory. It was Fennelly's first &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland&lt;/a&gt; medal.\nOn 20 July 2005, Fennelly missed Kilkenny's 0-17 to 1-10 defeat of Dublin in the &lt;a href=\"2005%20All-Ireland%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship%23Leinster%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Leinster final&lt;/a&gt; due to a hand injury. He was back on the starting fifteen for the &lt;a href=\"2005%20All-Ireland%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship%20Final\"&gt;All-Ireland final&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Galway%20GAA\"&gt;Galway&lt;/a&gt; on 18 September 2005, however, Fennelly ended the game on the losing side after a 1-15 to 1-14 defeat.\nOn 27 July 2006, Fennelly won a third successive Leinster Championship medal - his second on the field of play - after lining out at midfield in the 2-18 to 2-10 defeat of Dublin in the &lt;a href=\"2006%20All-Ireland%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship%23Leinster%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt;. On 10 September 2006, he was again selected at midfield when Kilkenny drew 2-14 apiece with &lt;a href=\"Tipperary%20GAA\"&gt;Tipperary&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2006%20All-Ireland%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship%20Final\"&gt;All-Ireland final&lt;/a&gt;. Fennelly retained the midfield berth for the replay on 16 September 2006 and collected a second &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Under-21%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;winners' medal&lt;/a&gt; after the 1-11 to 0-11 victory.\nSenior.\nBeginnings.\nWhile still a member of the under-21 team, Fennelly was added to the Kilkenny senior panel in 2006. He made his debut during the &lt;a href=\"National%20Hurling%20League\"&gt;National Hurling League&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently collected his first winners' medal following a 3\u201311 to 0\u201314 victory over &lt;a href=\"Limerick%20GAA\"&gt;Limerick&lt;/a&gt;. On 2 July 2006 he made his senior championship debut in a facile 1\u201323 to 2\u201312 provincial final defeat of Wexford. It was his first &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; medal. Fennelly later shared in Kilkenny's &lt;a href=\"All-Ireland%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;All-Ireland&lt;/a&gt; defeat of &lt;a href=\"Cork%20GAA\"&gt;Cork&lt;/a&gt; as a non-playing substitute.\nFennelly collected a second Leinster medal in 2007, as Kilkenny asserted their provincial dominance and defeated Wexford by 2\u201324 to 1\u201312. On 2 September 2007 Kilkenny faced defeated Munster finalists and surprise All-Ireland semi-final winners Limerick in the championship decider. Kilkenny got off to a flying start with &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Brennan\"&gt;Eddie Brennan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Shefflin\"&gt;Henry Shefflin&lt;/a&gt; scoring two goals within the first ten minutes to set the tone. Limerick launched a second-half comeback, however, \"the Cats\" were too powerful and cruised to a 2\u201319 to 1\u201315 victory. Fennelly, who started the game on the bench, came on to collect his first All-Ireland medal on the field of play.\nOn and off the team.\nIn 2008 Fennelly broke his wrist in a club game which ruled him out of the latter stages of the provincial championship. He was back as an unused substitute as Kilkenny later claimed a third successive All-Ireland title following a 3\u201330 to 1\u201313 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Waterford%20GAA\"&gt;Waterford&lt;/a&gt;.\nFennelly was appointed captain of the team in 2009, however, he found it difficult to claim a place on the starting fifteen. On 6 September Kilkenny were poised to become the second team ever in the history of hurling to win four successive All-Ireland championships when they faced &lt;a href=\"Tipperary%20GAA\"&gt;Tipperary&lt;/a&gt; in the decider. Fennelly, in spite of being captain, started the game on the bench before being introduced as a late substitute. For long periods Tipp looked the likely winners, however, late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Comerford\"&gt;Martin Comerford&lt;/a&gt; finally killed off their efforts to secure a 2\u201322 to 0\u201323 victory. Fennelly had collected his second All-Ireland medal on the field of play, while he also had the honour of lifting the &lt;a href=\"Liam%20MacCarthy%20Cup\"&gt;Liam MacCarthy Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2010 Kilkenny defeated Galway in an eagerly-anticipated but ultimately disappointing provincial decider. A 1\u201319 to 1\u201312 victory gave Fennelly a third Leinster medal. The drive for a fifth successive All-Ireland crown reached a head on 5 September 2010, when Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. \"The Cats\" lost talisman Henry Shefflin due to injury, while Tipperary's &lt;a href=\"Lar%20Corbett\"&gt;Lar Corbett&lt;/a&gt; ran riot and scored a hat-trick of goals as Fennelly's side fell to a 4\u201317 to 1\u201318 defeat. In spite of this defeat, Fennelly later won his first &lt;a href=\"GAA%20All%20Stars%20Awards\"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt; award.\nContinued dominance.\nKilkenny's stranglehold in Leinster continued in 2011. A 4\u201317 to 1\u201315 defeat of Dublin gave \"the Cats\" a record-equalling seventh successive championship. It was Fennelly's fourth winners' medal overall. Kilkenny subsequently faced Tipperary in a record-breaking sixth successive All-Ireland decider on 4 September 2011. Goals by Fennelly and &lt;a href=\"Richie%20Hogan\"&gt;Richie Hogan&lt;/a&gt; in either half gave Kilkenny, who many viewed as the underdogs going into the game, a 2\u201317 to 1\u201316 victory. It was Fennelly's third All-Ireland medal, while he later collected a second consecutive All-Star and two &lt;a href=\"Hurler%20of%20the%20Year%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;Hurler of the Year&lt;/a&gt; accolades.\n2012 began well for Fennelly when he collected a second league medal following a 3\u201321 to 0\u201316 demolition of old rivals Cork. Kilkenny were later shocked by Galway in the Leinster decider, losing by 2\u201321 to 2\u201311, however, both sides subsequently met in the All-Ireland decider on 9 September 2012. Kilkenny had led going into the final stretch, however, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Canning\"&gt;Joe Canning&lt;/a&gt; struck a stoppage time equaliser to level the game at 2\u201313 to 0\u201319 and send the final to a replay for the first time since 1959. The replay took place three weeks later on 30 September 2012. Galway stunned the reigning champions with two first-half goals, however, Kilkenny's championship debutant &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Walsh%20%28hurler%29\"&gt;Walter Walsh&lt;/a&gt; gave a man of the match performance, claiming a 1\u20133 haul. The 3\u201322 to 3\u201311 Kilkenny victory gave Fennelly a fourth All-Ireland medal.\nKilkenny's dominance showed no sign of abating in 2013, Fennelly winning a third National League medal following a 2\u201317 to 0\u201320 defeat of Tipperary in the decider.\nIn 2014 Fennelly collected his fourth league medal, as Kilkenny secured a narrow one-point 2\u201325 to 1\u201327 extra-time victory over Tipperary. He missed much of the provincial campaign but was restored to the starting fifteen on 7 September 2014 when Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All-Ireland decider. In what some consider to be the greatest game of all-time, the sides were level when Tipperary were awarded a controversial free. &lt;a href=\"John%20O%27Dwyer\"&gt;John O'Dwyer&lt;/a&gt; had the chance to win the game, however, his late free drifted wide resulting in a draw. The replay on 27 September 2014 was also a close affair. Goals from brothers &lt;a href=\"Richie%20Power%20%28hurler%20born%201985%29\"&gt;Richie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"John%20Power%20%28Carrickshock%20hurler%29\"&gt;John Power&lt;/a&gt; inspired Kilkenny to a 2\u201317 to 2\u201314 victory. It was Fennelly's fifth All-Ireland medal.\nAn ongoing back injury hindered Fennelly's championship campaign in 2015, resulting in him missing Kilkenny's 1-25 to 2-15 defeat of Galway in the provincial decider. Fennelly fought his way back to full fitness as Kilkenny subsequently renewed their rivalry with Galway in the All-Ireland decider on 6 September 2015. The team struggled in the first half, however, a &lt;a href=\"T.%20J.%20Reid\"&gt;T. J. Reid&lt;/a&gt; goal and a dominant second half display, which limited Galway to just 1-4, saw Kilkenny power to a 1-22 to 1-18 victory. The victory gave Fennelly a sixth All-Ireland medal while he was also chosen as the &lt;a href=\"man%20of%20the%20match\"&gt;man of the match&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 13 August 2016, it was confirmed that Fennelly would miss the &lt;a href=\"2016%20All-Ireland%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship%20Final\"&gt;2016 All-Ireland final&lt;/a&gt; after he ruptured his achilles tendon in the semi-final replay victory over &lt;a href=\"Waterford%20GAA\"&gt;Waterford&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn December 2017, Fennelly confirmed his retirement from Inter-County hurling. His last game was the &lt;a href=\"2017%20All-Ireland%20Senior%20Hurling%20Championship\"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt; qualifier defeat to &lt;a href=\"Waterford%20GAA\"&gt;Waterford&lt;/a&gt; on 8 July 2017 \nInter-provincial.\nAfter a two-year hiatus and a period of uncertainty surrounding the competition, the &lt;a href=\"Railway%20Cup\"&gt;Railway Cup&lt;/a&gt; returned in 2012 with Fennelly starting at midfield as &lt;a href=\"Leinster%20GAA\"&gt;Leinster&lt;/a&gt; faced &lt;a href=\"Connacht%20GAA\"&gt;Connacht&lt;/a&gt; in the decider. The game was effectively over at half time, with Leinster powering to an eventual 2\u201319 to 1\u201315 victory.\nManagerial career.\nKildare.\nIn December 2018 it was announced that Fennelly had joined the &lt;a href=\"Kildare%20GAA\"&gt;Kildare senior footballers'&lt;/a&gt; backroom team as their performance coach. Team manager &lt;a href=\"Cian%20O%27Neill\"&gt;Cian O'Neill&lt;/a&gt; defined his coaching role: \"He will be working on those intangibles, like your team work, your coherence, resilience; he will be a great aid for me and the management team as regards to his observation role but most importantly for the players; he'll be there to observe them (players) when it matters mostly, at training and at matches giving feedback; one-on-ones; acting as a conduit between the players and management; it's a very broad role.\"\nOffaly.\nOn 27 August 2019, it was announced that Fennelly had been proposed to become the next manager of the &lt;a href=\"Offaly%20senior%20hurling%20team\"&gt;Offaly senior hurling team&lt;/a&gt;. He was officially ratified for the position at a meeting of the &lt;a href=\"Offaly%20GAA\"&gt;Offaly County Board&lt;/a&gt; on 3 September 2019. Fennelly's backroom team included &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Kavanagh\"&gt;Michael Kavanagh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20Kenny%20%28hurler%29\"&gt;David Kenny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Kelly%20%28hurler%29\"&gt;Johnny Kelly&lt;/a&gt;. On 30 November 2019, Fennelly took charge of the Offaly senior team for the first time when he guided the team to a 2-28 to 0-18 defeat of &lt;a href=\"Kildare%20GAA\"&gt;Kildare&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"2020%20Kehoe%20Cup\"&gt;Kehoe Cup&lt;/a&gt;. On 12 January 2020, he claimed his first silverware when Offaly defeated &lt;a href=\"Antrim%20GAA\"&gt;Antrim&lt;/a&gt; by 1-16 to 1-15 to win the &lt;a href=\"Kehoe%20Cup\"&gt;Kehoe Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Ballyhale\"&gt;Ballyhale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"County%20Kilkenny\"&gt;County Kilkenny&lt;/a&gt;, Fennelly is the member of a hurling dynasty from the locality. His grandfather, &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Fennelly%20%28senior%29\"&gt;Kevin Fennelly, Snr&lt;/a&gt;, played with Kilkenny in the 1940s before later becoming heavily involved in the establishment of Ballyhale Shamrocks in 1972. His father, Mick, and his six uncles, &lt;a href=\"Brendan%20Fennelly\"&gt;Brendan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ger%20Fennelly\"&gt;Ger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kevin%20Fennelly\"&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Fennelly\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Se%C3%A1n%20Fennelly\"&gt;Se\u00e1n&lt;/a&gt; and Dermot, all played with the Shamrocks with several of them playing for Kilkenny at all levels.\nFennelly was educated at the local national school before later completing his &lt;a href=\"Leaving%20Certificate\"&gt;Leaving Certificate&lt;/a&gt; at Scoil Aireagail. He subsequently completed a degree in business studies at the &lt;a href=\"Cork%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;Cork Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;, before later becoming a bank official with &lt;a href=\"Ulster%20Bank\"&gt;Ulster Bank&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2012 Fennelly left his banking job and completed a one-year MSC in Sports Performance at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Limerick\"&gt;University of Limerick&lt;/a&gt;.
