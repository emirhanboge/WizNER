    "text": "Clea was an English &lt;a href=\"girl%20group\"&gt;girl group&lt;/a&gt; whose members met on the television show \"\" in 2002. Chloe Morgan (n\u00e9e Staines), Lynsey Brown, Emma Beard, and Aimee Kearsley, decided to form a band after they were voted off the series. The name 'Clea' is an acronym of the first letter of each member's name.\nHistory.\nThey initially had a management contract with Upside Management a company set up by former BMG / Sony employee's Denise Beighton and Simon Jones and recording contract with &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Music\"&gt;Warner&lt;/a&gt; offshoot 1967 Records and released their first single, \"Download It\", in 2003. It entered the &lt;a href=\"UK%20Singles%20Chart\"&gt;UK Singles Chart&lt;/a&gt; at number 21 and the band spent the remainder of the year playing small concerts in the United Kingdom.\nIn February 2004, the band released their second single, \"&lt;a href=\"Stuck%20in%20the%20Middle%20%28Clea%20song%29\"&gt;Stuck in the Middle&lt;/a&gt;\" which reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart. They continued playing, including appearances at Soccer 6 in &lt;a href=\"Liverpool\"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reading%2C%20Berkshire\"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt;. In May of that year, Chloe Morgan left the group to pursue her solo career. \nClea's debut album, \"&lt;a href=\"Identity%20Crisis%20%28Clea%20album%29\"&gt;Identity Crisis&lt;/a&gt;\" was released in Russia, Eastern Europe and in certain countries in Asia. In these regions, the band had seen some moderate interest; however, due to being unsuccessful, they were dropped from 1967 Records in late 2004. Clea were continued to be managed by &lt;a href=\"Upside%20Records\"&gt;Upside Management&lt;/a&gt; and released music independently through a specially created label.\nIn September 2005, Clea collaborated with production group Da Playaz to release a single, named \"&lt;a href=\"We%20Don%27t%20Have%20To%20Take%20Our%20Clothes%20Off\"&gt;We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off&lt;/a&gt;\" a dance &lt;a href=\"cover%20version\"&gt;remake&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Narada%20Michael%20Walden\"&gt;Narada Michael Walden&lt;/a&gt; song originally made famous by &lt;a href=\"Jermaine%20Stewart\"&gt;Jermaine Stewart&lt;/a&gt;. This single reached number 35 on the UK &lt;a href=\"record%20chart\"&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Like%20That\"&gt;Lucky Like That&lt;/a&gt;\", released in June 2006, was the band's fourth single. This single placed at number 55 on the UK chart. \"Trinity\", Clea's second album (but first UK album), was released on 3 July on &lt;a href=\"Upside%20Records\"&gt;Upside Records&lt;/a&gt;. Lynsey Brown left the band in November 2006. They then released the double &lt;a href=\"A-side%20and%20B-side\"&gt;a-side&lt;/a&gt; single \"&lt;a href=\"Stuck%20in%20the%20Middle%20%28Clea%20song%29\"&gt;Stuck in the Middle&lt;/a&gt;\"/\"&lt;a href=\"I%20Surrender%20%28Clea%20song%29\"&gt;I Surrender&lt;/a&gt;\" in Europe and toured Asia and Scandinavia in 2007. They also signed to EMI China and toured there on several occasions.\nAfter Clea.\nAimee Kearsley, who now resides in London, has continued working in music as a successful songwriter since leaving the group. In 2011 she joined girlband Fanfair. Performing initially at &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; games across the UK and performing at Twickenham Stadium, they went on to tour the UK and Ireland on The Wanted sell-out arena tour \"The Code\".
