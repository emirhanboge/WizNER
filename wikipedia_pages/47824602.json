    "text": "Zadoc Benedict was a &lt;a href=\"hat\"&gt;hat&lt;/a&gt; manufacturer who established the first hat factory on Main Street in &lt;a href=\"Danbury%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Danbury, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; in 1780. It had 3 employees, and made 18 hats weekly.\nLegend holds that Benedict plugged a hole in his shoe with &lt;a href=\"rabbit%20fur\"&gt;rabbit fur&lt;/a&gt;, and found that over time the &lt;a href=\"fur\"&gt;fur&lt;/a&gt; turned into &lt;a href=\"felt\"&gt;felt&lt;/a&gt;. He then supposedly developed a process of making hats from the fur of locally available animals, like rabbit and &lt;a href=\"beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt;."
