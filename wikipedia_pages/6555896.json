Attached to the &lt;a href=\"1st%20U-boat%20Flotilla\"&gt;1st U-boat Flotilla&lt;/a&gt;, she made nine successful patrols in the North Atlantic, the last two under the command of \"&lt;a href=\"Oberleutnant%20zur%20See\"&gt;Oberleutnant zur See&lt;/a&gt;\" G\u00fcnther Rosenberg. She was a member of eight &lt;a href=\"Wolfpack%20%28naval%20tactic%29\"&gt;wolfpack&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShe was sunk on 17 February 1943 in the North Atlantic, by &lt;a href=\"depth%20charge\"&gt;depth charge&lt;/a&gt;s from a British warship. All 49 hands were lost.\nDesign.\n&lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20VII%20submarine%23Type%20VIIC\"&gt;German Type VIIC submarines&lt;/a&gt; were preceded by the shorter &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20VII%20submarine%23Type%20VIIB\"&gt;Type VIIB submarines&lt;/a&gt;. \"U-201\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged.

When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"U-201\" was fitted with five &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es, one &lt;a href=\"8.8%20cm%20SK%20C/35%20naval%20gun\"&gt;SK C/35 naval gun&lt;/a&gt;, 220 rounds, and a &lt;a href=\"2%20cm%20FlaK%2030\"&gt;C/30&lt;/a&gt; anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20company\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; of between forty-four and sixty.\nService history.\nFirst patrol.\n\"U-201\" departed &lt;a href=\"Kiel\"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt; for her first patrol on 22 April 1941. Her route took her across the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea\"&gt;North Sea&lt;/a&gt;, through the &lt;a href=\"GIUK%20gap\"&gt;gap&lt;/a&gt; separating &lt;a href=\"Iceland\"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Faroe%20Islands\"&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/a&gt; and into the Atlantic Ocean. Her first 'kill' was \"Capulet\" which she sank on 2 May south of Iceland. The ship had already been &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;ed by ; her back was broken, she had caught fire and been abandoned.\nMoving east of &lt;a href=\"Greenland\"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, she sank \"Greglia\" on 9 May and damaged \"Empire Cloud\" on the same day.\nShe was attacked over five hours by three escorts from &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20convoys\"&gt;Convoy OB-318&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 99 depth charges were dropped, severely damaging the boat, but she escaped. She docked at &lt;a href=\"Lorient\"&gt;Lorient&lt;/a&gt; in occupied France on 18 May.\nSecond patrol.\nThe submarine's second foray passed without major incident: starting on 8 June 1941, finishing on 19 July but in &lt;a href=\"Brest%2C%20France\"&gt;Brest&lt;/a&gt;. (For the rest of her career she would be based in this French Atlantic port).\nThird patrol.\n\"U-201\"s third sortie began from Brest on 14 August 1941. On the 19th in mid-Atlantic she took part in a &lt;a href=\"Wolfpack%20%28naval%20tactic%29\"&gt;wolfpack&lt;/a&gt; attack on &lt;a href=\"Convoy%20OG%2071\"&gt;Convoy OG 71&lt;/a&gt;. Firing one spread of four torpedoes she hit the cargo ship \"Ciscar\" and passenger liner , which was carrying the &lt;a href=\"Convoy%20Commodore\"&gt;Convoy Commodore&lt;/a&gt; and 86 other Royal Navy personnel. Both ships sank, and \"Aguila\"s sinking killed 152 of the 168 people aboard, including all but one of the naval staff.\n\"U-201\" continued with the concerted attack on OG 71, sinking the Irish \"Clonlara\" on 22 August and British merchants \"Aldergrove\" and \"Stork\" northwest of &lt;a href=\"Lisbon\"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; on the 23rd, before returning to Brest on the 25th.\nFourth patrol.\nSuccess continued to accompany \"U-201\". Having departed Brest on 14 September 1941 she sank \"Runa\", \"Lissa\" and \"Rhineland\", all on 21 September.\nShe then sank \"Cervantes\" on 27 September. This ship had four survivors from \"Ciscar\" on board. She also accounted for HMS \"Springbank\", a &lt;a href=\"Fighter%20catapult%20ship\"&gt;Fighter catapult ship&lt;/a&gt; about west southwest of &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Clear%20Island\"&gt;Cape Clear&lt;/a&gt;, southern Ireland on the same date. One torpedo was seen to pass between \"Springbank\" and \"Leadgate\", but two others sealed the British vessel's fate.\nThe submarine's final victim on this patrol was \"Margareta\", which went down southwest of Cape Clear.\n\"U-201\" returned to Brest on 30 September.\nFifth patrol.\nOn \"U-201\"s fifth sortie; she failed to find any targets.\nSixth patrol.\n\"U-201\" commenced her sixth and longest patrol on 24 March 1942. Having departed Brest and crossed the Atlantic, she damaged the &lt;a href=\"Argentina%20in%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Argentinian&lt;/a&gt; and neutral \"Victoria\" about east of &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Hatteras\"&gt;Cape Hatteras&lt;/a&gt;, North Carolina on 18 April. The crew, realizing that the ship, despite the torpedo strike, was not settling, decided to stay on board. The U-boat men saw the neutrality markings only after a second torpedo was fired and the submarine had surfaced. \"Victoria\"s complement then abandoned its vessel; \"U-201\" reported its mistake to the \"&lt;a href=\"BdU\"&gt;BdU&lt;/a&gt;\" (U-boat headquarters) which ordered it to clear the area, which it did.\n, an American minesweeper towing the barge \"YOG-38\", picked up \"Victoria\"s distress signals and sent a boarding party across to the tanker to effect repairs. The ship reached New York on 21 April and after much legal wrangling, was repaired and requisitioned by the US government and returned to service in July. She survived the war.\nThree more ships went to the bottom on this patrol - \"Bris\" on 21 April, \"&lt;a href=\"SS%20San%20Jacinto%20%281903%29\"&gt;SS San Jacinto (1903)&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Derryheen\", both on 22 April.\nThe boat returned to Brest on 21 May.\nSeventh patrol.\nPatrol number seven was in tonnage terms, the boat's most successful. Departing Brest on 27 June 1942, she operated in the eastern north Atlantic, sinking the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Star%20Line\"&gt;Blue Star Line&lt;/a&gt;r east of &lt;a href=\"S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island\"&gt;S\u00e3o Miguel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Azores\"&gt;Azores&lt;/a&gt; on 6 July. Casualties were increased when a torpedo exploded under a lifeboat that had just been lowered from the ship and the remaining lifeboats became separated, one spending 20 days at sea before being rescued and another being lost without trace.\nAnother victim, \"Cortuna\", was sunk about west of &lt;a href=\"Madeira\"&gt;Madeira&lt;/a&gt; on 12 July after had already hit her. The \"Siris\" went down on the same day after a torpedo and 100 rounds from the &lt;a href=\"deck%20gun\"&gt;deck gun&lt;/a&gt;.\nThree more ships were sunk before the submarine returned to Brest on 8 August.\nEighth patrol.\nSo it went on; this time in the waters off South America. Another three ships met their end. One, the &lt;a href=\"Liberty%20ship\"&gt;Liberty ship&lt;/a&gt; , was sunk about east of &lt;a href=\"Trinidad\"&gt;Trinidad&lt;/a&gt;, only after a chase lasting 32 hours, and seven torpedoes on 8 October 1942. Also involved was .\nAnother, \"Flensburg\", went down the following day about from &lt;a href=\"Suriname\"&gt;Suriname&lt;/a&gt;. The 48 survivors were spotted by a Yugoslavian merchant ship, but when they learned of the prospect of an unescorted Atlantic crossing to &lt;a href=\"Durban\"&gt;Durban&lt;/a&gt;, opted to remain in their lifeboats until they reached the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Maroni%20%28river%29\"&gt;River Marowijine&lt;/a&gt;.\nNinth patrol and loss.\nThe boat left Brest for the last time on 3 January 1943 and headed for the eastern coast of Canada. She was sunk in position by depth charges from the British destroyer east of &lt;a href=\"Newfoundland%20%28island%29\"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;.\n49 men died; there were no survivors.\nPreviously recorded fate.\n\"U-201\" was sunk by depth charges from the British destroyer east of Newfoundland on 17 February 1942. This attack sank .\nWolfpacks.\n\"U-201\" took part in eight &lt;a href=\"Wolfpack%20%28naval%20tactic%29\"&gt;wolfpack&lt;/a&gt;s, namely:"
