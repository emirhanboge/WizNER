    "text": "Plethodon is a genus of &lt;a href=\"salamander\"&gt;salamander&lt;/a&gt;s in the family &lt;a href=\"Plethodontidae\"&gt;Plethodontidae&lt;/a&gt;. They are also known as woodland salamanders or, more rarely, slimy salamanders. All members of the genus are &lt;a href=\"endemic\"&gt;endemic&lt;/a&gt; to North America (Canada and USA). They have no aquatic larval stage. In some species, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Plethodon%20cinereus\"&gt;Plethodon cinereus&lt;/a&gt;\", the red-backed salamander, eggs are laid underneath a stone or log. Young hatch in the adult form. Members of \"Plethodon\" primarily eat small invertebrates. The earliest known fossils of this genus are from the &lt;a href=\"Hemphillian\"&gt;Hemphillian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tennessee\"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.\nSpecies.\nThere are 56 species in the genus \"Plethodon\". Listed in alphabetical order of &lt;a href=\"specific%20name%20%28zoology%29\"&gt;specific name&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Nota%20bene\"&gt;Nota bene&lt;/a&gt;\": A &lt;a href=\"Binomial%20nomenclature\"&gt;binomial authority&lt;/a&gt; in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than \"Plethodon\"."
