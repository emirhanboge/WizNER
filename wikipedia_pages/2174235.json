Its exact date is uncertain, but K\u0101lid\u0101sa is often placed in the 4th century\u00a0CE.\nOrigin of K\u0101lid\u0101sa's play.\nPlots similar to the play appear in earlier texts. There is a story mentioned in the \"&lt;a href=\"Mahabharata\"&gt;Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata&lt;/a&gt;\". A story of similar plot appear in the Buddhist &lt;a href=\"Jataka%20tales\"&gt;J\u0101taka tales&lt;/a&gt; as well. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the story appears as a precursor to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava and Kaurava lineages. In the story King Du\u1e63yanta and \u015aakuntal\u0101 meet in the forest and get estranged and ultimately reunited. Their son &lt;a href=\"Bharata%20%28Mahabharata%29\"&gt;Bharata&lt;/a&gt; is said to have laid the foundation of the dynasty that ultimately led to &lt;a href=\"Kaurava\"&gt;Kaurava&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Pandava\"&gt;P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTitle.\nManuscripts differ on what its exact title is. Usual variants are \"Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015bakuntal\u0101\", \"Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntala\", \"Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015bakuntalam\" and the \"grammatically indefensible\" \"Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam\". The Sanskrit title means \"pertaining to the recognition of Shakuntala\", so a literal translation could be \"Of \u015aakuntal\u0101 who is recognized\". The title is sometimes translated as \"The token-for-recognition of \u015aakuntal\u0101\" or \"The Sign of \u015aakuntal\u0101\". Titles of the play in published translations include \"Sacontal\u00e1 or The Fatal Ring\" and \"\u015aakoontal\u00e1 or The Lost Ring\". A more recent translation by Barbara Stoler Miller (1984) was entitled \"Sakuntala and the Ring of Recollection\".\nSynopsis.\nThe protagonist is &lt;a href=\"Shakuntala\"&gt;\u015aakuntal\u0101&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the sage &lt;a href=\"Vishwamitra\"&gt;Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"apsara\"&gt;apsara&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Menaka\"&gt;Menak\u0101&lt;/a&gt;. Abandoned at birth by her parents, \u015aakuntal\u0101 is reared in the secluded hermitage of the sage &lt;a href=\"Kanva\"&gt;Ka\u1e47va&lt;/a&gt;, and grows up a comely but innocent maiden.\nWhile Ka\u1e47va and the other elders of the hermitage are away on a pilgrimage, &lt;a href=\"Dushyanta\"&gt;Du\u1e63yanta&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href=\"Hastinapura\"&gt;Hastin\u0101pura&lt;/a&gt;, comes hunting in the forest. Just as he was about to slay a deer, Vaikh\u0101nasa, a sage obstructs him saying that the deer was from the hermitage and must not be slayed. He politely requests the king to take his arrow back, to which the king complies. The sage then informs him that they are going to collect firewood for the &lt;a href=\"sacrificial%20fire\"&gt;sacrificial fire&lt;/a&gt; and asks him to join them. They then spot the hermitage of Sage Ka\u1e47va and decide to pay the hermits a visit. However the king decides to go to this penance grove dressed up as a commoner. He also stops the chariot farther away to not disturb the hermits. The moment he enters the hermitage and spots \u015aakuntal\u0101, he is captivated by her, courts her in royal style, and marries her. Soon, he has to leave to take care of affairs in the capital. The king gives her a ring which, as it turns out, will eventually have to be presented to him when she appears in his court to claim her place as queen.\nOne day, the anger-prone sage &lt;a href=\"Durvasa\"&gt;Durv\u0101sa&lt;/a&gt; arrives when \u015aakuntala is lost in her thoughts, and when she fails to attend to him, he curses her by bewitching Du\u1e63yanta into forgetting her existence. The only cure is for \u015aakuntala to show the king the &lt;a href=\"signet%20ring\"&gt;signet ring&lt;/a&gt; that he gave her.\nShe later travels to meet him, and has to cross a river. The ring is lost when it slips off her hand as she dips it in the water playfully. On arrival the king is unable to recognize the person he married and therefore refuses to acknowledge her. \u015aakuntala is abandoned by her companions who declare that she should remain with her husband. They then return to the hermitage.\nFortunately, the ring is discovered by a fisherman in the belly of a fish, and presents it in the king's court. Du\u1e63yanta realizes his mistake - too late. The newly wise Du\u1e63yanta is asked to defeat an army of &lt;a href=\"Asuras\"&gt;Asuras&lt;/a&gt;, and is rewarded by &lt;a href=\"Indra\"&gt;Indra&lt;/a&gt; with a journey through heaven. After returning to Earth years later, Du\u1e63yanta finds \u015aakuntala and their son by chance, and recognizes them.\nIn other versions, especially the one found in the '&lt;a href=\"Mahabharata\"&gt;Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata&lt;/a&gt;', \u015aakuntala is not reunited until their son Bharata is born, and found by the king playing with lion cubs. Du\u1e63yanta meets young Bharata and enquires about his parents, and finds out that Bharata is indeed his son. Bharata is an ancestor of the lineages of the &lt;a href=\"Kauravas\"&gt;Kauravas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandavas\"&gt;P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas&lt;/a&gt;, who fought the epic war of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. It is after this Bharata that India was given the name \"Bh\u0101ratavarsha\", the 'Land of Bharata'.\nReception.\nBy the 18th century, Western poets were beginning to get acquainted with works of Indian literature and &lt;a href=\"Indian%20philosophy\"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. \"Shakuntala\" was the first Indian drama to be translated into a Western language, by &lt;a href=\"William%20Jones%20%28philologist%29\"&gt;Sir William Jones&lt;/a&gt; in 1789. In the next 100 years, there were at least 46 translations in twelve European languages.\nIntroduction in the West.\n\"Sacontal\u00e1 or The Fatal Ring\", Sir William Jones' translation of K\u0101lid\u0101sa's play, was first published in Calcutta, followed by European republications in 1790, 1792 and 1796. A German (by &lt;a href=\"Georg%20Forster\"&gt;Georg Forster&lt;/a&gt;) and a French version of Jones' translation were published in 1791 and 1803 respectively. &lt;a href=\"Goethe\"&gt;Goethe&lt;/a&gt; published an epigram about Shakuntala in 1791, and in &lt;a href=\"Goethe%27s%20Faust\"&gt;his \"Faust\"&lt;/a&gt; he adopted a theatrical convention from the prologue of K\u0101lid\u0101sa's play. &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Schlegel\"&gt;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to translate the work into German never materialised, but he did however publish a translation of the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" version of \u015aakuntal\u0101's story in 1808. &lt;a href=\"Goethe\"&gt;Goethe&lt;/a&gt;'s epigram goes like this:\nEducation in British India.\n\"Shakuntala\" was disapproved of as a text for school and college students in the &lt;a href=\"British%20Raj\"&gt;British Raj&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century, as popular Indian literature was deemed, in the words of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Charles%20Trevelyan%2C%201st%20Baronet\"&gt;Charles Trevelyan&lt;/a&gt;, to be \"marked with the greatest immorality and impurity\", and Indian students were thought by colonial administrators to be insufficiently morally and intellectually advanced to read the Indian texts that were taught and praised in Britain.\nUnfinished opera projects.\nWhen Leopold Schefer became a student of &lt;a href=\"Antonio%20Salieri\"&gt;Antonio Salieri&lt;/a&gt; in September 1816, he had been working on an opera about Shakuntala for at least a decade, a project which he did however never complete. &lt;a href=\"Franz%20Schubert\"&gt;Franz Schubert&lt;/a&gt;, who had been a student of Salieri until at least December of the same year, started composing his &lt;a href=\"Sakuntala%20%28opera%29\"&gt;\"Sakuntala\" opera&lt;/a&gt;, \u00a0701, in October 1820. &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Philipp%20Neumann\"&gt;Johann Philipp Neumann&lt;/a&gt; based the &lt;a href=\"libretto\"&gt;libretto&lt;/a&gt; for this opera on K\u0101lid\u0101sa's play, which he probably knew through one or more of the three German translations that had been published by that time. Schubert abandoned the work in April 1821 at the latest. A short extract of the unfinished score was published in 1829. Also &lt;a href=\"V%C3%A1clav%20Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1ek\"&gt;V\u00e1clav Tom\u00e1\u0161ek&lt;/a&gt; left an incomplete \"Sakuntala\" opera.\nNew adaptations and editions.\nK\u0101lid\u0101sa's \"\u015aakuntal\u0101\" was the model for the libretto of 's first opera, which premi\u00e8red in 1853. In 1853 &lt;a href=\"Monier%20Monier-Williams\"&gt;Monier Monier-Williams&lt;/a&gt; published the Sanskrit text of the play. Two years later he published an English translation of the play, under the title: \"\u015aakoontal\u00e1 or The Lost Ring\". A ballet version of K\u0101lid\u0101sa's play, \"Sacountal\u00e2\", on a libretto by &lt;a href=\"Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier\"&gt;Th\u00e9ophile Gautier&lt;/a&gt; and with music by &lt;a href=\"Ernest%20Reyer\"&gt;Ernest Reyer&lt;/a&gt;, was first performed in Paris in 1858. A plot summary of the play was printed in the score edition of &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Goldmark\"&gt;Karl Goldmark&lt;/a&gt;'s Overture to \"Sakuntala\", Op.\u00a013 (1865). &lt;a href=\"Sigismund%20Bachrich\"&gt;Sigismund Bachrich&lt;/a&gt; composed a \"Sakuntala\" ballet in 1884. &lt;a href=\"Felix%20Weingartner\"&gt;Felix Weingartner&lt;/a&gt;'s opera \"Sakuntala\", with a libretto based on K\u0101lid\u0101sa's play, premi\u00e8red the same year. Also &lt;a href=\"Philipp%20Scharwenka\"&gt;Philipp Scharwenka&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Sakuntala\", a choral work on a text by Carl Wittkowsky, was published in 1884.\nBengali translations:\nTamil translations include:\n&lt;a href=\"Felix%20Woyrsch\"&gt;Felix Woyrsch&lt;/a&gt;'s incidental music for K\u0101lid\u0101sa's play, composed around 1886, is lost. &lt;a href=\"Ignacy%20Jan%20Paderewski\"&gt;Ignacy Jan Paderewski&lt;/a&gt; would have composed a Shakuntala opera, on a libretto by &lt;a href=\"Catulle%20Mend%C3%A8s\"&gt;Catulle Mend\u00e8s&lt;/a&gt;, in the first decade of the 20th century: the work is however no longer listed as extant in overviews of the composer's or librettist's oeuvre. &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20W.%20Ryder\"&gt;Arthur W. Ryder&lt;/a&gt; published a new English translation of \"Shakuntala\" in 1912. Two years later he collaborated to an English performance version of the play.\nAlfano's opera.\nItalian &lt;a href=\"Franco%20Alfano\"&gt;Franco Alfano&lt;/a&gt; composed an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt;, named \"&lt;a href=\"Sak%C3%B9ntala\"&gt;La leggenda di Sak\u00f9ntala&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"The legend of Sak\u00f9ntala\") in its first version (&lt;a href=\"1921%20in%20music%23Opera\"&gt;1921&lt;/a&gt;) and simply \"&lt;a href=\"Sak%C3%B9ntala\"&gt;Sak\u00f9ntala&lt;/a&gt;\" in its second version (&lt;a href=\"1952%20in%20music%23Opera\"&gt;1952&lt;/a&gt;).\nFurther developments.\nChinese translation:\nFritz Racek's completion of Schubert's \"Sakontala\" was performed in Vienna in 1971. Another completion of the opera, by &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Aage%20Rasmussen\"&gt;Karl Aage Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt;, was published in 2005 and recorded in 2006. A scenic performance of this version was premi\u00e8red in 2010.\nNorwegian electronic musician &lt;a href=\"Amethystium\"&gt;Amethystium&lt;/a&gt; wrote a song called \"Garden of Sakuntala\" which can be found on the CD \"Aphelion\". According to &lt;a href=\"Philip%20Lutgendorf\"&gt;Philip Lutgendorf&lt;/a&gt;, the narrative of the movie &lt;a href=\"Ram%20Teri%20Ganga%20Maili\"&gt;Ram Teri Ganga Maili&lt;/a&gt; recapitulates the story of Shakuntala.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Koodiyattam\"&gt;Koodiyattam&lt;/a&gt;, the only surviving ancient Sanskrit theatre tradition, prominent in the state of &lt;a href=\"Kerala\"&gt;Kerala&lt;/a&gt; on India, performances of K\u0101lid\u0101sa's plays are rare. However, legendary Kutiyattam artist and \"&lt;a href=\"Natyashastra\"&gt;Natyashastra&lt;/a&gt;\" scholar \"N\u0101ty\u0101ch\u0101rya Vid\u016bshakaratnam &lt;a href=\"Padma%20Shri\"&gt;Padma Shri&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Guru\"&gt;Guru&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"M%C4%81ni%20M%C4%81dhava%20Ch%C4%81ky%C4%81r\"&gt;M\u0101ni M\u0101dhava Ch\u0101ky\u0101r&lt;/a&gt; has choreographed a Koodiyattam production of \"The Recognition of Sakuntala\".\nA production directed by Tarek Iskander was mounted for a run at London's Union Theatre in January and February 2009. The play is also appearing on a Toronto stage for the first time as part of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20130509171350/http%3A//www.movietrailerlive.com/ct_0001_HarbourfrontCentreWorldStage\"&gt;Harbourfront World Stage program.&lt;/a&gt; An adaptation by the Magis Theatre Company &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.magistheatre.org\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; featuring the music of Indian-American composer &lt;a href=\"Rudresh%20Mahanthappa\"&gt;Rudresh Mahanthappa&lt;/a&gt; had its premiere at La MaMa E.T.C. in New York February 11\u201328, 2010.\nFilm adaptations.\nIt is one of the few &lt;a href=\"Classical%20Sanskrit%20literature\"&gt;classical Sanskrit plays&lt;/a&gt; that have been adapted to the silver screen in India and of them the most adapted (another being the &lt;a href=\"M%E1%B9%9Bcchakatika\"&gt;M\u1e5bcchakatika&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"%C5%9A%C5%ABdraka\"&gt;\u015a\u016bdraka&lt;/a&gt;).
