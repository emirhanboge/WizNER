    "text": "Johor Bahru () is the capital of the state of &lt;a href=\"Johor\"&gt;Johor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. It is located along the &lt;a href=\"Straits%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Straits of Johor&lt;/a&gt; at the southern end of &lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20Malaysia\"&gt;Peninsular Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. The city has a population of 663,307 within an area of 220\u00a0km2. Johor Bahru is adjacent to the city of &lt;a href=\"Iskandar%20Puteri\"&gt;Iskandar Puteri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pasir%20Gudang\"&gt;Pasir Gudang&lt;/a&gt;, together with their surrounding areas anchoring Malaysia's third largest urban agglomeration, &lt;a href=\"Iskandar%20Malaysia\"&gt;Iskandar Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, with a population of 1,638,219.\nJohor Bahru was founded in 1855 as \"Tanjung Puteri\" when the &lt;a href=\"Sultanate%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Sultanate of Johor&lt;/a&gt; came under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Temenggong\"&gt;Temenggong&lt;/a&gt; Daeng Ibrahim. The area was renamed \"Johore Bahru\" in 1862 and became the capital of the Sultanate when the Sultanate administration centre was moved there from Telok Blangah.\nDuring the reign of Sultan &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Bakar%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Abu Bakar&lt;/a&gt;, there was development and modernisation within the city; with the construction of administrative buildings, schools, religious buildings, and railways connecting to &lt;a href=\"Woodlands%2C%20Singapore\"&gt;Woodlands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. The Japanese forces occupied Johor Bahru from 1942 to 1945. Johor Bahru became the cradle of &lt;a href=\"Early%20Malay%20nationalism\"&gt;Malay nationalism&lt;/a&gt; after the war and gave birth to a political party named &lt;a href=\"United%20Malays%20National%20Organisation\"&gt;United Malays National Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (UMNO) in 1946. After the formation of Malaysia in 1963, Johor Bahru retained its status as state capital and was granted city status in 1994.\nEtymology.\nThe present area of Johor Bahru was originally known as \"Tanjung Puteri\", and was a fishing village of the &lt;a href=\"Ethnic%20Malays\"&gt;Malays&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Temenggong\"&gt;Temenggong&lt;/a&gt; Daeng Ibrahim then renamed \"Tanjung Puteri\" to \"Iskandar Puteri\" once he arrived in the area in 1858 after acquiring the territory from &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Ali%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Sultan Ali&lt;/a&gt;; before it was renamed Johor Bahru by &lt;a href=\"Abu%20Bakar%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Sultan Abu Bakar&lt;/a&gt; following the Temenggong's death. (The suffix \"Bah(a)ru\" means \"new\" in Malay, normally written \"baru\" in standard spelling today but appearing with several variants in place names, such as &lt;a href=\"Kota%20Bharu\"&gt;Kota Bharu&lt;/a&gt; and Indonesian &lt;a href=\"Pekanbaru\"&gt;Pekanbaru&lt;/a&gt;.) The &lt;a href=\"British%20English\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; preferred to spell its name as \"Johore Bahru\" or \"Johore Bharu\", but the current accepted western spelling is \"Johor Bahru\", as \"Johore\" is only spelt \"Johor\" (without the letter \"e\" at the end of the word) in the &lt;a href=\"Malay%20language\"&gt;Malay language&lt;/a&gt;. The city is also spelt as Johor Baru or Johor Baharu.\nThe city was also once known as \"Little Swatow (Shantou)\" by the &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20Chinese\"&gt;Chinese community&lt;/a&gt; in Johor Bahru, as most of Johor Bahru's Chinese residents are &lt;a href=\"Teochew%20people\"&gt;Teochew people&lt;/a&gt; whose ancestry can be traced back to &lt;a href=\"Shantou\"&gt;Shantou&lt;/a&gt;, China. They arrived in the mid 19th century, during the reign of Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim.\nHistory.\nDue to a dispute between the Malays and the &lt;a href=\"Bugis%20people\"&gt;Bugis&lt;/a&gt;, the Johor-Riau Sultanate was split in 1819 with the &lt;a href=\"Johor%20Sultanate\"&gt;mainland Johor Sultanate&lt;/a&gt; came under the control of &lt;a href=\"Temenggong%20Daeng%20Ibrahim\"&gt;Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href=\"Riau-Lingga%20Sultanate\"&gt;Riau-Lingga Sultanate&lt;/a&gt; came under the control of the Bugis. The Temenggong intended to create a new administration centre for the Johor Sultanate to create a dynasty under the entity of Temenggong. As the Temenggong already had a close relationship with the British and the British intended to have control over trade activities in Singapore, a treaty was signed between Sultan &lt;a href=\"Ali%20Iskandar%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Ali&lt;/a&gt; and Temenggong Ibrahim in Singapore on 10 March 1855. According to the treaty, Ali would be crowned as the Sultan of Johor and receive $5,000 (in &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20dollar\"&gt;Spanish dollar&lt;/a&gt;s) with an allowance of $500 per month. In return, Ali was required to cede the sovereignty of the territory of Johor (except &lt;a href=\"Kesang%2C%20Malaysia\"&gt;Kesang&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Muar%20District\"&gt;Muar&lt;/a&gt; which would be the only territory under his control) to Temenggong Ibrahim. When both sides agreed on Temenggong acquiring the territory, he renamed it \"Iskandar Puteri\" and began to administer it from &lt;a href=\"Telok%20Blangah\"&gt;Telok Blangah&lt;/a&gt; in Singapore.\nAs the area was still an undeveloped jungle, Temenggong encouraged the migration of &lt;a href=\"Overseas%20Chinese\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Javanese%20people\"&gt;Javanese&lt;/a&gt; to clear the land and to develop an agricultural economy in Johor. The Chinese planted the area with &lt;a href=\"black%20pepper\"&gt;black pepper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gambier%20%28extract%29\"&gt;gambier&lt;/a&gt;, while the Javanese dug \"parit\" (&lt;a href=\"canal\"&gt;canal&lt;/a&gt;s) to drain water from the land, build roads and plant &lt;a href=\"coconut\"&gt;coconut&lt;/a&gt;s. During this time, a Chinese businessman, pepper and gambier cultivator, &lt;a href=\"Wong%20Ah%20Fook\"&gt;Wong Ah Fook&lt;/a&gt; arrived; at the same time, &lt;a href=\"Kangchu%20system\"&gt;Kangchu&lt;/a&gt; and Javanese labour contract systems were introduced by the Chinese and Javanese communities. After Temenggong's death on 31 January 1862, the town was renamed \"Johor Bahru\" and his position was succeeded by his son, Abu Bakar, with the administration centre in Telok Blangah being moved to the area in 1889.\nBritish administration.\nIn the first phase of Abu Bakar's administration, the British only recognised him as a \"&lt;a href=\"maharaja\"&gt;maharaja&lt;/a&gt;\" rather than a \"&lt;a href=\"sultan\"&gt;sultan&lt;/a&gt;\". In 1855, the &lt;a href=\"Colonial%20Office\"&gt;British Colonial Office&lt;/a&gt; began to recognise his status as a Sultan after he met &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. He managed to regain &lt;a href=\"Kesang%2C%20Malaysia\"&gt;Kesang&lt;/a&gt; territory for Johor after &lt;a href=\"Jementah%20Civil%20War\"&gt;a civil war&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of British forces and he boosted the town's infrastructure and agricultural economy. Infrastructure such as the &lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Abu%20Bakar%20State%20Mosque\"&gt;State Mosque&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Istana%20Besar\"&gt;Royal Palace&lt;/a&gt; was built with the aid of Wong Ah Fook, who had become a close patron for the Sultan since his migration during the Temenggong reign. As the Johor-British relationship improved, Abu Bakar also set up his administration under a British style and implemented a constitution known as \"&lt;a href=\"Undang-undang%20Tubuh%20Negeri%20Johor\"&gt;Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor&lt;/a&gt;\" (Johor State Constitution). Although the British had long been advisers for the Sultanate of Johor, the Sultanate never came under direct colonial rule of the British. The direct colonial rule only came into effect when the status of the adviser was elevated to a status similar to that of a &lt;a href=\"Resident%20%28title%29\"&gt;Resident&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Federated%20Malay%20States\"&gt;Federated Malay States&lt;/a&gt; (FMS) during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Sultan Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt; in 1914.\nIn Johor Bahru, the &lt;a href=\"Federated%20Malay%20States%20Railways\"&gt;Malay Peninsula railway extension&lt;/a&gt; was finished in 1909, and in 1923 the Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway was completed. Johor Bahru developed at a modest rate &lt;a href=\"interwar%20period\"&gt;between the First and Second\u00a0World\u00a0Wars&lt;/a&gt;. The secretariat building\u2014&lt;a href=\"Sultan%20Ibrahim%20Building\"&gt;Sultan Ibrahim Building&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was completed in 1940 as the British colonial government attempted to streamline the state's administration.\nWorld War II.\nThe continuous development of Johor Bahru was, however, halted when &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Japan\"&gt;the Japanese&lt;/a&gt; under General &lt;a href=\"Tomoyuki%20Yamashita\"&gt;Tomoyuki Yamashita&lt;/a&gt; invaded the town on 31 January 1942. As the Japanese had reached northwest Johor by 15 January, they easily captured major towns of Johor such of &lt;a href=\"Batu%20Pahat%20%28town%29\"&gt;Batu Pahat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yong%20Peng\"&gt;Yong Peng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kluang\"&gt;Kluang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayer%20Hitam\"&gt;Ayer Hitam&lt;/a&gt;. The British and other &lt;a href=\"Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;Allied forces&lt;/a&gt; were forced to retreat towards Johor Bahru; however, following a further series of bombings by the Japanese on 29 January, the British retreated to Singapore and blew up the causeway the following day as a final attempt to stop the Japanese advance in British Malaya. The Japanese then used the Sultan's residence of &lt;a href=\"Istana%20Bukit%20Serene\"&gt;Bukit Serene Palace&lt;/a&gt; located in the town as their main temporary base for their future initial plans to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Singapore\"&gt;conquer Singapore&lt;/a&gt; while waiting to reconnect the causeway. The Japanese chose the palace as their main base because they already knew the British would not dare to attack it as this would harm their close relationship with Johor.\nIn less than a month, the Japanese repaired the causeway and invaded the Singapore island easily. Soon after the war ended in 1946, the town became the main hotspot for &lt;a href=\"Early%20Malay%20nationalism\"&gt;Malay nationalism&lt;/a&gt; in Malaya. &lt;a href=\"Onn%20Jaafar\"&gt;Onn Jaafar&lt;/a&gt;, a local Malay politician who later became the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Menteris%20Besar%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Chief Minister of Johor&lt;/a&gt;, formed the &lt;a href=\"United%20Malay%20National%20Organisation\"&gt;United Malay National Organisation&lt;/a&gt; party on 11 May 1946 when the Malays expressed their widespread disenchantment over the &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British government&lt;/a&gt;'s action for granting citizenship laws to non-Malays in the proposed states of the &lt;a href=\"Malayan%20Union\"&gt;Malayan Union&lt;/a&gt;. An agreement over the policy was then reached in the town with Malays agreeing with the dominance of economy by the non-Malays and the Malays' dominance in political matters being agreed upon by non-Malays. Racial conflict between the Malay and non-Malays, especially the Chinese, is being provoked continuously since the &lt;a href=\"Malayan%20Emergency\"&gt;Malayan Emergency&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-independence.\nAfter the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, Johor Bahru continued as the state capital and more development was carried out, with the town's expansion and the construction of more new townships and industrial estates. The &lt;a href=\"Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation\"&gt;Indonesian confrontation&lt;/a&gt; did not directly affect Johor Bahru as the main Indonesian landing point in Johor was in &lt;a href=\"Landing%20at%20Labis\"&gt;Labis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tenang\"&gt;Tenang&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Segamat%20District\"&gt;Segamat District&lt;/a&gt; as well &lt;a href=\"Pontian%20District\"&gt;Pontian District&lt;/a&gt;. There is only one active Indonesian spy organisation in the town, known as \"Gerakan Ekonomi Melayu Indonesia\" (GEMI). They frequently engaged with the Indonesian communities living there to contribute information for Indonesian commandos until the &lt;a href=\"MacDonald%20House%20bombing\"&gt;bombing of the MacDonald House&lt;/a&gt; in Singapore in 1965. By the early 1990s, the town had considerably expanded in size, and was officially granted a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20cities%20in%20Malaysia\"&gt;city status&lt;/a&gt; on 1 January 1994. &lt;a href=\"Johor%20Bahru%20City%20Council\"&gt;Johor Bahru City Council&lt;/a&gt; was formed and the city's current main square, &lt;a href=\"Dataran%20Bandaraya%20Johor%20Bahru\"&gt;Dataran Bandaraya Johor Bahru&lt;/a&gt;, was constructed to commemorate the event. A central business district was developed in the centre of the city from the mid-1990s in the area around &lt;a href=\"Jalan%20Wong%20Ah%20Fook\"&gt;Wong Ah Fook Street&lt;/a&gt;. The state and federal government channelled considerable funds for the development of the city\u2014particularly more so after 2006, when the &lt;a href=\"Iskandar%20Malaysia\"&gt;Iskandar Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; was formed. However, more than ten years of unbridled building construction in Iskandar, especially of higher-end high-rise apartments and commercial property, has led to a serious glut of such property in the region. Occupancy of high-rise accommodation has been predicted to fall to 50 percent, and commercial property to 65 percent, by the end of 2019 due to continued incoming supply.\nGovernance.\nAs the capital city of Johor, the city plays an important role in the economic welfare of the entire state's population. There is one member of parliament (MP) representing the single &lt;a href=\"Johor%20Bahru%20%28federal%20constituency%29\"&gt;parliamentary constituency&lt;/a&gt; (\"P.160\") in the city. The city also elects two representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Larkin and Stulang.\nLocal authority and city definition.\nThe city is administered by the &lt;a href=\"Johor%20Bahru%20City%20Council\"&gt;Johor Bahru City Council&lt;/a&gt;. The current mayor is Dato' Haji Mohd Noorazam bin Dato' Haji Osman, which took office since 15 August 2021. Johor Bahru &lt;a href=\"Cities%20of%20Malaysia\"&gt;obtained city status&lt;/a&gt; on 1 January 1994. The area under the jurisdiction of the Johor Bahru City Council includes Central District, Kangkar Tebrau, &lt;a href=\"Kempas\"&gt;Kempas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Larkin%2C%20Johor\"&gt;Larkin&lt;/a&gt;, Majidee, Maju Jaya, Mount Austin, Pandan, &lt;a href=\"Pasir%20Pelangi\"&gt;Pasir Pelangi&lt;/a&gt;, Pelangi, &lt;a href=\"Permas%20Jaya\"&gt;Permas Jaya&lt;/a&gt;, Rinting, &lt;a href=\"Tampoi%2C%20Johor\"&gt;Tampoi&lt;/a&gt;, Tasek Utara and &lt;a href=\"Tebrau\"&gt;Tebrau&lt;/a&gt;. This covers an area of . Currently there are 11 council members in the city council, which consists of 3 &lt;a href=\"National%20Trust%20Party%20%28Malaysia%29\"&gt;Amanah&lt;/a&gt; members, 3 &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20United%20Indigenous%20Party\"&gt;Bersatu&lt;/a&gt; members, 3 &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Action%20Party%20%28Malaysia%29\"&gt;DAP&lt;/a&gt; members and 2 &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Justice%20Party%20%28Malaysia%29\"&gt;PKR&lt;/a&gt; members. In August 2021, mayor Adib Azhari Daud was arrested and taken into custody for allegedly accepting bribes from contractors while overseeing development of Johor Bahru. The arrest marks the first time an active Johor mayor has been arrested.\nCourts of law and legal enforcement.\nThe &lt;a href=\"High%20Courts%20of%20Malaysia\"&gt;city high court&lt;/a&gt; complex is located along Dato' Onn Road. The Sessions and Magistrate Courts is located on Ayer Molek Road, while another &lt;a href=\"Syariah%20Court\"&gt;court&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Sharia\"&gt;Sharia&lt;/a&gt; law is located on Abu Bakar Road. The Johor (state) Police Contingent Headquarters is located on Tebrau Road. Johor Bahru's Southern District police headquarters, which also operates as a police station, is on Meldrum Road in the city centre. The Johor Bahru Southern District traffic police headquarters is a separate entity along Tebrau Road, close to the city centre. Johor Bahru's Northern District police headquarters and Northern District Traffic Police headquarters are co-located in Skudai, about 20\u00a0km north of the city centre. There are around eleven police stations and seven police substations (Pondok Polis) in the greater Johor Bahru area. &lt;a href=\"Johor%20Bahru%20Prison\"&gt;Johor Bahru Prison&lt;/a&gt; was located in the city along Ayer Molek Road, but was closed down after 122 years operation in December 2005, its function being transferred to an expanded prison in the town of Kluang about 110\u00a0km from Johor Bahru. Other temporary lock-ups or prison cells are available in most police stations in the city, as in other parts of Malaysia.\nGeography.\nJohor Bahru is located along the &lt;a href=\"Straits%20of%20Johor\"&gt;Straits of Johor&lt;/a&gt; at the southern end of &lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20Malaysia\"&gt;Peninsular Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, the city area was only in 1933 before it was expanded to over in 2000.\nClimate.\nThe city has an equatorial climate with consistent temperatures, a considerable amount of rain, and high humidity throughout the course of the year. An equatorial climate is a &lt;a href=\"tropical%20rainforest%20climate\"&gt;tropical rainforest climate&lt;/a&gt; more subject to the &lt;a href=\"Intertropical%20Convergence%20Zone\"&gt;Intertropical Convergence Zone&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href=\"trade%20wind\"&gt;trade wind&lt;/a&gt;s and with no &lt;a href=\"cyclone\"&gt;cyclone&lt;/a&gt;. Daily average temperatures range from in January to in April with an average annual rainfall of around . The wettest months, with 19 to 25 percent more rain than average, are April, November and December. Although the climate is relatively uniform, it does show some seasonal variation due to the effects of &lt;a href=\"monsoon\"&gt;monsoon&lt;/a&gt;s, with noticeable changes in wind speed and direction, cloud cover and amount of rainfall. There are two monsoon periods each year, the first one between mid-October and January, which is the north-east Monsoon. This period is characterised by heavier rainfall and wind from the north-east. The second one is the south-west Monsoon, which hardly affects the rainfall in Johor Bahru, where winds are from the south and south-west. This occurs between June and September.\nDemographics.\nJohor Bahru has an official &lt;a href=\"demonym\"&gt;demonym&lt;/a&gt; where people are commonly referred to as \"Johor Bahruans\". The &lt;a href=\"Adjectivals%20and%20demonyms%20for%20cities\"&gt;terms&lt;/a&gt; \"J.B-ites\" and \"J.B-ians\" have also been used to a limited extent. People from Johor are called Johoreans.\nEthnicity and religion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2010%20Malaysian%20Census\"&gt;Malaysian Census in 2010&lt;/a&gt; reported the population of Johor Bahru as 497,067. The city's population today is a mixture of three main ethnicities - Malays, &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20Chinese\"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20Indian\"&gt;Indians&lt;/a&gt;- along with other &lt;a href=\"bumiputras\"&gt;bumiputras&lt;/a&gt;. Malays comprise a plurality of the population at 240,323, followed by Chinese totalling 172,609, Indians totaling 73,319 and others totalling 2,957. Non-Malaysian citizens form a population of 2,585. The Malays in Johor Bahru are strongly related to the neighbouring Riau Malays. The Chinese mainly are from the majority &lt;a href=\"Teochew%20people\"&gt;Teochew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hoklo%20people\"&gt;Hokkien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hainanese%20people\"&gt;Hainanese&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hakka%20people\"&gt;Hakka&lt;/a&gt; dialect groups, while the Indian community mainly and predominantly are &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20people\"&gt;Tamils&lt;/a&gt;, there are also small populations of &lt;a href=\"Telugus\"&gt;Telugus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malayalis\"&gt;Malayalis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sikh\"&gt;Sikh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Punjabi%20people\"&gt;Punjabis&lt;/a&gt;. The Malays are majority &lt;a href=\"Muslim\"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt;s, while the Chinese are predominantly &lt;a href=\"Buddhists\"&gt;Buddhists&lt;/a&gt; and the Indian were mostly &lt;a href=\"Hindus\"&gt;Hindus&lt;/a&gt; despite there is also a small numbers from the two ethnic groups that are Christians and Muslims. A small number of &lt;a href=\"Sikhism\"&gt;Sikhs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taoists\"&gt;Taoists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Animism\"&gt;Animists&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"secularism\"&gt;secularists&lt;/a&gt; can also be found in the city.\nThe following is based on Department of Statistics Malaysia 2010 census.\nLanguages.\nThe local ethnic Malays speak the Malay language, while the language primarily spoken by the local Chinese is &lt;a href=\"Mandarin%20Chinese\"&gt;Mandarin Chinese&lt;/a&gt;. The Chinese community is represented by several dialect groups: &lt;a href=\"Teochew%20dialect\"&gt;Teochew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hainanese\"&gt;Hainanese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakka%20Chinese\"&gt;Hakka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hokkien\"&gt;Hokkien&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Indian community predominantly speaks &lt;a href=\"Tamil%20language\"&gt;Tamil&lt;/a&gt;, with a minority of &lt;a href=\"Malayalam\"&gt;Malayalam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Telugu%20language\"&gt;Telugu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Punjabi%20language\"&gt;Punjabi&lt;/a&gt; speakers. The English language (or &lt;a href=\"Manglish\"&gt;Manglish&lt;/a&gt;) is also used considerably, albeit more so among the older generation, who have attended school during the British rule.\nEconomy.\nJohor Bahru is one of the fastest-growing cities in Malaysia after &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Lumpur\"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt;. It is the main commercial centre for Johor and is located in the &lt;a href=\"Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%E2%80%93Singapore%20Growth%20Triangle\"&gt;Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Singapore Growth Triangle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tertiary%20sector%20of%20industry\"&gt;Tertiary-based industry&lt;/a&gt; dominates the economy with many international tourists from the regions visiting the city. It is the centre of financial services, commerce and retail, arts and culture, hospitality, urban tourism, plastic manufacturing, electrical and electronics and food processing. The main shopping districts are located within the city, with a number of large shopping malls located in the suburbs. Johor Bahru is the location of numerous &lt;a href=\"Business%20conference\"&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;, congress and trade fairs, such as the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Regional%20Organisation%20for%20Planning%20and%20Housing\"&gt;Eastern Regional Organisation for Planning and Housing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"World%20Islamic%20Economic%20Forum\"&gt;World Islamic Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt;. The city is the first in Malaysia to practise a &lt;a href=\"low-carbon%20economy\"&gt;low-carbon economy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city has a very close economic relationship with &lt;a href=\"Singapore\"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. There are around 3,000 logistic lorries crossing between Johor Bahru and Singapore every day for delivering goods between the two sides for trading activities. Many residents in Singapore frequently visit the city during the weekends; some of them have also chosen to live in the city.
