    "text": "A system is a group of &lt;a href=\"Interaction\"&gt;interacting&lt;/a&gt; or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole. A system, surrounded and influenced by its environment, is described by its boundaries, &lt;a href=\"structure\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt; and purpose and expressed in its functioning. Systems are the subjects of study of &lt;a href=\"systems%20theory\"&gt;systems theory&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"systems%20science\"&gt;systems science&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"system\" comes from the &lt;a href=\"Latin\"&gt;Latin&lt;/a&gt; word \"syst\u0113ma\", in turn from &lt;a href=\"Greek%20language\"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; \"syst\u0113ma\": \"whole concept made of several parts or members, system\", literary \"composition\".\nHistory.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20McLuhan\"&gt;Marshall McLuhan&lt;/a&gt;,\n\"System\" means \"something to look at\". You must have a very high visual gradient to have systematization. But in philosophy, prior to Descartes, there was no \"system\". Plato had no \"system\". Aristotle had no \"system\".\nIn the 19th century the French physicist &lt;a href=\"Nicolas%20L%C3%A9onard%20Sadi%20Carnot\"&gt;Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot&lt;/a&gt;, who studied &lt;a href=\"thermodynamics\"&gt;thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt;, pioneered the development of the concept of a \"system\" in the &lt;a href=\"natural%20science\"&gt;natural science&lt;/a&gt;s. In 1824 he studied the system which he called the \"working substance\" (typically a body of water vapor) in &lt;a href=\"steam%20engine\"&gt;steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s, in regards to the system's ability to do work when heat is applied to it. The working substance could be put in contact with either a boiler, a cold reservoir (a stream of cold water), or a piston (on which the working body could do work by pushing on it). In 1850, the German physicist &lt;a href=\"Rudolf%20Clausius\"&gt;Rudolf Clausius&lt;/a&gt; generalized this picture to include the concept of the &lt;a href=\"environment%20%28systems%29\"&gt;surroundings&lt;/a&gt; and began to use the term \"working body\" when referring to the system.\nThe biologist &lt;a href=\"Ludwig%20von%20Bertalanffy\"&gt;Ludwig von Bertalanffy&lt;/a&gt; became one of the pioneers of the &lt;a href=\"Systems%20theory\"&gt;general systems theory&lt;/a&gt;. In 1945 he introduced \"models, principles, and laws that apply to generalized systems or their subclasses, irrespective of their particular kind, the nature of their component elements, and the relation or 'forces' between them.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Norbert%20Wiener\"&gt;Norbert Wiener&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20Ross%20Ashby\"&gt;Ross Ashby&lt;/a&gt;, who pioneered the use of mathematics to study systems, carried out significant development in the concept of a \"system\".\nIn the 1980s &lt;a href=\"John%20Henry%20Holland\"&gt;John Henry Holland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Murray%20Gell-Mann\"&gt;Murray Gell-Mann&lt;/a&gt; and others coined the term \"&lt;a href=\"complex%20adaptive%20system\"&gt;complex adaptive system&lt;/a&gt;\" at the interdisciplinary &lt;a href=\"Santa%20Fe%20Institute\"&gt;Santa Fe Institute&lt;/a&gt;.\nConcepts.\nSubsystem.\nA subsystem is a set of elements, which is a system itself, and a component of a larger system. The IBM Mainframe \"Job Entry Subsystem\" family (&lt;a href=\"JES1\"&gt;JES1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"JES2\"&gt;JES2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"JES3\"&gt;JES3&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href=\"Houston%20Automatic%20Spooling%20Priority\"&gt;HASP&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Attached%20Support%20Processor\"&gt;ASP&lt;/a&gt; predecessors) are examples. The main \"elements\" they have in common are the components that handle input, scheduling, spooling and output; they also have the ability to interact with local and remote operators.\nA subsystem description is a system object that contains information defining the characteristics of an operating environment controlled by the system. The Data tests are performed to verify the correctness of the individual subsystem configuration data (e.g. MA Length, Static Speed Profile, \u2026) and they are related to a single subsystem in order to test its Specific Application (SA).\nAnalysis.\nThere are many kinds of systems that can be analyzed both &lt;a href=\"Quantitative%20research\"&gt;quantitatively&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Qualitative%20research\"&gt;qualitatively&lt;/a&gt;. For example, in an analysis of urban &lt;a href=\"System%20dynamics\"&gt;systems dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, A .W. Steiss defined five intersecting systems, including the physical subsystem and behavioral system. For sociological models influenced by systems theory, &lt;a href=\"Kenneth%20D.%20Bailey%20%28sociologist%29\"&gt;Kenneth D. Bailey&lt;/a&gt; defined systems in terms of &lt;a href=\"conceptual%20system\"&gt;conceptual&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Concrete%20%28philosophy%29\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;, and abstract systems, either &lt;a href=\"Isolated%20system\"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Closed%20system\"&gt;closed&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Open%20system%20%28systems%20theory%29\"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Walter%20F.%20Buckley\"&gt;Walter F. Buckley&lt;/a&gt; defined systems in sociology in terms of &lt;a href=\"Mechanics\"&gt;mechanical&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"organic%20%28model%29\"&gt;organic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"process%20modeling\"&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; models. &lt;a href=\"Bela%20H.%20Banathy\"&gt;Bela H. Banathy&lt;/a&gt; cautioned that for any inquiry into a system understanding its kind is crucial, and defined \"natural\" and \"designed\", i. e. artificial, systems.\nIt is important not to confuse these abstract definitions. For example, natural systems include subatomic systems, &lt;a href=\"living%20systems%20theory\"&gt;living systems&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"solar%20system\"&gt;solar system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galaxy\"&gt;galaxies&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Universe\"&gt;Universe&lt;/a&gt;, while artificial systems include man-made physical structures, hybrids of natural and artificial systems, and conceptual knowledge. The human elements of organization and functions are emphasized with their relevant abstract systems and representations.\nArtificial systems inherently have a major defect: they must be premised on one or more fundamental assumptions upon which additional knowledge is built. This is in strict alignment to the &lt;a href=\"G%C3%B6del%27s%20incompleteness%20theorems\"&gt;G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems&lt;/a&gt;. The Artificial system can be defined as a \"consistent formalized system which contains elementary arithmetic\". These fundamental assumptions are not inherently deleterious, but they must by definition be assumed as true, and if they are actually false then the system is not as structurally integral as is assumed (i.e. it is evident that if the initial expession is false, then the Artificial system is not a \"consistent formalized system\"). For example, in &lt;a href=\"geometry\"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt; this is very evident in the postulation of &lt;a href=\"theorem\"&gt;theorem&lt;/a&gt;s and extrapolation of proofs from them.\n&lt;a href=\"George%20J.%20Klir\"&gt;George J. Klir&lt;/a&gt; maintained that no \"classification is complete and perfect for all purposes\", and defined systems as abstract, &lt;a href=\"The%20Real\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"conceptual%20system\"&gt;conceptual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"physical%20systems\"&gt;physical systems&lt;/a&gt;, bounded and &lt;a href=\"unbounded%20system\"&gt;unbounded system&lt;/a&gt;s, discrete to continuous, pulse to &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20system\"&gt;hybrid system&lt;/a&gt;s, etc. The interactions between systems and their environments are categorized as relatively closed and &lt;a href=\"open%20system%20%28systems%20theory%29\"&gt;open systems&lt;/a&gt;. It seems most unlikely that an absolutely closed system can exist or, if it did, that it could be known by man. Important distinctions have also been made between \"hard\" systems \u2013 technical in nature and amenable to methods such as &lt;a href=\"systems%20engineering\"&gt;systems engineering&lt;/a&gt;, operations research, and quantitative systems analysis \u2013 and \"soft\" systems that involve people and organisations, commonly associated with concepts developed by &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Checkland\"&gt;Peter Checkland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Wilson%20%28systems%20scientist%29\"&gt;Brian Wilson&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Soft%20systems%20methodology\"&gt;Soft Systems Methodology&lt;/a&gt; (SSM) involving methods such as &lt;a href=\"action%20research\"&gt;action research&lt;/a&gt; and emphasis of participatory designs. Where hard systems might be identified as more \"scientific\", the distinction between them is often elusive.\nCultural system.\nA cultural system may be defined as the interaction of different elements of &lt;a href=\"culture\"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt;. While a cultural system is quite different from a &lt;a href=\"social%20system\"&gt;social system&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes both together are referred to as a \"sociocultural system\". A major concern of the social sciences is the &lt;a href=\"Social%20order\"&gt;problem of order&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomic system.\nAn economic system is a mechanism (&lt;a href=\"social%20institution\"&gt;social institution&lt;/a&gt;) which deals with the &lt;a href=\"Economic%20production\"&gt;production&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"distribution%20%28business%29\"&gt;distribution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"consumption%20%28economics%29\"&gt;consumption&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Good%20%28economics%29\"&gt;goods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Service%20%28economics%29\"&gt;services&lt;/a&gt; in a particular &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt;. The economic system is composed of &lt;a href=\"person\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"institutions\"&gt;institutions&lt;/a&gt; and their relationships to resources, such as the &lt;a href=\"Convention%20%28norm%29\"&gt;convention&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"property\"&gt;property&lt;/a&gt;. It addresses the problems of &lt;a href=\"economics\"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt;, like the allocation and scarcity of resources.\nThe international sphere of interacting states is described and analysed in systems terms by several international relations scholars, most notably in the &lt;a href=\"Neorealism%20%28international%20relations%29\"&gt;neorealist school.&lt;/a&gt; This systems mode of international analysis has however been challenged by other schools of international relations thought, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Constructivism%20%28international%20relations%29\"&gt;constructivist school&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that an over-large focus on systems and structures can obscure the role of individual agency in social interactions. Systems-based models of international relations also underlies the vision of the international sphere held by the &lt;a href=\"Institutional%20liberalism\"&gt;liberal institutionalist&lt;/a&gt; school of thought, which places more emphasis on systems generated by rules and interaction governance, particularly economic governance.\nApplications.\nSystems modeling is generally a basic principle in engineering and in social sciences. The system is the representation of the entities under concern. Hence inclusion to or exclusion from system context is dependent on the intention of the modeler.\nNo model of a system will include all features of the real system of concern, and no model of a system must include all entities belonging to a real system of concern.\nInformation and computer science.\nIn &lt;a href=\"computer%20science\"&gt;computer science&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"information%20science\"&gt;information science&lt;/a&gt;, system is a hardware system, software system, or combination, which has &lt;a href=\"Component%20%28UML%29\"&gt;components&lt;/a&gt; as its structure and observable &lt;a href=\"inter-process%20communication\"&gt;inter-process communication&lt;/a&gt;s as its behavior. Again, an example will illustrate: There are systems of counting, as with &lt;a href=\"Roman%20numerals\"&gt;Roman numerals&lt;/a&gt;, and various systems for filing papers, or catalogues, and various library systems, of which the &lt;a href=\"Dewey%20Decimal%20Classification\"&gt;Dewey Decimal Classification&lt;/a&gt; is an example. This still fits with the definition of components which are connected together (in this case to facilitate the flow of information).\nSystem can also refer to a framework, aka &lt;a href=\"platform%20%28computing%29\"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt;, be it software or hardware, designed to allow software programs to run. A flaw in a component or system can cause the component itself or an entire system to fail to perform its required function, e.g., an incorrect &lt;a href=\"Statement%20%28computer%20science%29\"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Data%20definition%20language\"&gt;data definition&lt;/a&gt;\nEngineering and physics.\nIn &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"physics\"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt;, a physical system is the portion of the universe that is being studied (of which a &lt;a href=\"thermodynamic%20system\"&gt;thermodynamic system&lt;/a&gt; is one major example). Engineering also has the concept of a system referring to all of the parts and interactions between parts of a complex project. &lt;a href=\"Systems%20engineering\"&gt;Systems engineering&lt;/a&gt; is the branch of engineering that studies how this type of system should be planned, designed, implemented, built, and maintained. Expected &lt;a href=\"result\"&gt;result&lt;/a&gt; is the behavior predicted by the specification, or another source, of the component or system under specified conditions.\nSociology, cognitive science and management research.\nSocial and &lt;a href=\"cognitive%20science\"&gt;cognitive science&lt;/a&gt;s recognize systems in human person models and in human societies. They include human brain functions and mental processes as well as normative ethics systems and social/cultural behavioral patterns.\nIn &lt;a href=\"management%20science\"&gt;management science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"operations%20research\"&gt;operations research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"organizational%20development\"&gt;organizational development&lt;/a&gt; (OD), human organizations are viewed as systems (conceptual systems) of interacting components such as subsystems or system aggregates, which are carriers of numerous complex &lt;a href=\"business%20processes\"&gt;business processes&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"organizational%20behavior\"&gt;organizational behavior&lt;/a&gt;s) and organizational structures. Organizational development theorist &lt;a href=\"Peter%20Senge\"&gt;Peter Senge&lt;/a&gt; developed the notion of organizations as systems in his book \"The Fifth Discipline\".\n&lt;a href=\"Organizational%20studies\"&gt;Organizational theorists&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Wheatley\"&gt;Margaret Wheatley&lt;/a&gt; have also described the workings of organizational systems in new metaphoric contexts, such as &lt;a href=\"quantum%20physics\"&gt;quantum physics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chaos%20theory\"&gt;chaos theory&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"self-organizing%20systems\"&gt;self-organization of systems&lt;/a&gt;.\nPure logic.\nThere is also such a thing as a &lt;a href=\"logical%20system\"&gt;logical system&lt;/a&gt;. The most obvious example is the calculus developed simultaneously by &lt;a href=\"Leibniz\"&gt;Leibniz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isaac%20Newton\"&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/a&gt;. Another example is &lt;a href=\"George%20Boole\"&gt;George Boole&lt;/a&gt;'s Boolean operators. Other examples have related specifically to philosophy, biology, or cognitive science. &lt;a href=\"Maslow%27s%20hierarchy%20of%20needs\"&gt;Maslow's hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt; applies psychology to biology by using pure logic. Numerous psychologists, including &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Jung\"&gt;Carl Jung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sigmund%20Freud\"&gt;Sigmund Freud&lt;/a&gt; have developed systems which logically organize psychological domains, such as personalities, motivations, or intellect and desire. Often these domains consist of general categories following a &lt;a href=\"corollary\"&gt;corollary&lt;/a&gt; such as a &lt;a href=\"theorem\"&gt;theorem&lt;/a&gt;. Logic has been applied to categories such as &lt;a href=\"taxonomy%20%28general%29\"&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ontology\"&gt;ontology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"educational%20assessment\"&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"hierarchies\"&gt;hierarchies&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategic thinking.\nIn 1988, military strategist, &lt;a href=\"John%20A.%20Warden%20III\"&gt;John A. Warden III&lt;/a&gt; introduced the &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Five%20Rings\"&gt;Five Ring System&lt;/a&gt; model in his book, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Air%20Campaign\"&gt;The Air Campaign&lt;/a&gt;\", contending that any complex system could be broken down into five concentric rings. Each ring\u2014Leadership, Processes, Infrastructure, Population and Action Units\u2014could be used to isolate key elements of any system that needed change. The model was used effectively by Air Force planners in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Gulf%20War\"&gt;First Gulf War&lt;/a&gt;. In the late 1990s, Warden applied his model to business strategy."
