    "text": "There have been concerns and controversies about the &lt;a href=\"2022%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;2022 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;, which will be hosted in &lt;a href=\"Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;.\nSelection of venues.\nAthletics.\nIn June 2017, during the preparation of the &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20bid%20for%20the%202022%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;Birmingham bid for the 2022 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;, the Birmingham bid committee proposed to renovate &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Stadium\"&gt;Alexander Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and use it for hosting the athletics and ceremonies of the Games. But in August 2017, former &lt;a href=\"UK%20Athletics\"&gt;UK Athletics&lt;/a&gt; (UKA) Chief Ed Warner proposed the &lt;a href=\"London%20Stadium\"&gt;London Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to host the athletic events while &lt;a href=\"Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20%28region%29\"&gt;West Midlands&lt;/a&gt; to host the rest of the sporting events of the Games. The London Stadium hosted the &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Summer%20Olympics%20opening%20ceremony\"&gt;opening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2012%20Summer%20Olympics%20closing%20ceremony\"&gt;closing&lt;/a&gt; ceremonies of the &lt;a href=\"2012%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2012 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2012%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;Paralympics&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"2017%20World%20Athletics%20Championships\"&gt;2017 World Athletic Championships&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2017%20World%20Para%20Athletics%20Championships\"&gt;Para Athletics Championships&lt;/a&gt;. Ed Warner claimed that enough funds could be saved by using the London Stadium rather than renovating Alexander Stadium in Birmingham.\nOn 11 April 2018, British Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Theresa%20May\"&gt;Theresa May&lt;/a&gt; visited Alexander Stadium and announced that the stadium would be renovated for the Games at a cost of \u00a370 million. She said that the investment would benefit the local community and the West Midlands region.\nIn February 2019, Councillor &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Tilsley\"&gt;Paul Tilsley&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the refurbished Alexander Stadium would become a &lt;a href=\"white%20elephant\"&gt;white elephant&lt;/a&gt; after the Games as no long-term tenant for the stadium was identified. He was also concerned about the funding arrangement of the Games and claimed that spending funds in organizing the Games could put the council into very heavy debt.\nOn 21 June 2019, &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20Council\"&gt;Birmingham City Council&lt;/a&gt; released the images and plans for renovating Alexander Stadium and claimed that it would create a legacy asset for the &lt;a href=\"Perry%20Barr\"&gt;Perry Barr&lt;/a&gt; area in which it stands. The council claimed that the stadium could become the permanent home for the UKA and host major athletics events such as the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20League\"&gt;Diamond League&lt;/a&gt; meeting which is currently held at the London Stadium. But former UKA chief Ed Warner claimed that moving the main athletic events from London to Birmingham would be unattractive for the UKA both financially and in terms of the sport's profile. A UKA spokesperson also told the &lt;a href=\"Press%20Association%20Sport\"&gt;Press Association Sport&lt;/a&gt; that the UKA had no plans to take athletics events out of London Stadium.\nOn 30 January 2020, Birmingham City Council's planning committee approved the renovation plans for Alexander Stadium which would cost \u00a372 million. The revamped stadium would also host a range of tenants including &lt;a href=\"Birchfield%20Harriers\"&gt;Birchfield Harriers&lt;/a&gt; Athletics Club and &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20University\"&gt;Birmingham City University&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrack cycling.\nThe track cycling events will be hosted at the &lt;a href=\"Lee%20Valley%20VeloPark\"&gt;Lee Valley VeloPark&lt;/a&gt; velodrome in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; which is 136 miles (218\u00a0km) away from the Games host city Birmingham. This was confirmed by Ian Ward, Leader of the Birmingham City Council and Head of the Birmingham 2022 bid, on the day of Games host city announcement. He cited the reason that West Midlands do not have a suitable facility to host track cycling. The Birmingham bid committee had investigated using the &lt;a href=\"Derby%20Arena\"&gt;Derby Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Derby\"&gt;Derby&lt;/a&gt; to hold track cycling or converting the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Birmingham\"&gt;Arena Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; into a temporary velodrome but instead chose to use the Lee Valley VeloPark velodrome in London. The Lee Valley VeloPark is situated on &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20Olympic%20Park\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratford%2C%20London\"&gt;Stratford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"East%20London\"&gt;East London&lt;/a&gt; and has previously hosted the track cycling of the &lt;a href=\"Cycling%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2012 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cycling%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;Paralympics&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"2016%20UCI%20Track%20Cycling%20World%20Championships\"&gt;2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe people of Birmingham and the West Midlands were shocked and unhappy with the bid committee's decision as they would have to travel to London to watch the events. In January 2018, a petition addressed to Ian Ward was launched by Charlie Dickens, a citizen from West Midlands, on &lt;a href=\"Change.org\"&gt;Change.org&lt;/a&gt;, calling for a velodrome to be constructed in the West Midlands for use at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. It claimed that the construction of a venue would help to develop the sport in the West Midlands region, which has a population of 5.6 million people but no indoor velodrome. It also said that velodromes could be used as a multi-sport facility by hosting basketball, netball, table tennis and boxing, as well as staging non-sporting events, such as music concerts. Over 5,000 people had signed the petition within four months from the date of bid committee's decision and former &lt;a href=\"International%20Cycling%20Union\"&gt;International Cycling Union&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href=\"Brian%20Cookson\"&gt;Brian Cookson&lt;/a&gt; and Olympic gold medallist &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Boardman\"&gt;Chris Boardman&lt;/a&gt; also supported bringing a velodrome to the West Midlands.\nIn September 2018, Ian Ward defended the committee's decision of selecting the velodrome in London rather than constructing a new velodrome in the West Midlands and also claimed that the decision was reached in consultation with &lt;a href=\"British%20Cycling\"&gt;British Cycling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sport%20England\"&gt;Sport England&lt;/a&gt;. He said that constructing a new velodrome would cost \u00a350 million which could have disturbed the Games' as well as the council's budget. Further he added that the bid committee had asked the Origin Sports Group to carry out feasibility work to assess the viability of installing a temporary track to ensure track cycling would be part of the Games. They also continued to explore both temporary options in the city as well as looking at venues within the region, such as Derby Arena. To meet the CGF's venue requirements for hosting track cycling, minimum seating capacity must be 4,000 which ruled out the temporary options that were being explored in the city, as well as Derby Arena. The only suitable velodromes in the country are Lee Valley VeloPark velodrome London, which has 6,500 seats, and &lt;a href=\"Manchester%20Velodrome\"&gt;Manchester Velodrome&lt;/a&gt;, which could install sufficient temporary seating to meet the 4,000 minimum capacity. The organising committee finally agreed with the Lee Valley VeloPark in London to host the games' track cycling events. He also added that the construction of a \u00a350 million velodrome would have made staging the Games, as a whole, an unviable proposition, which he meant that the city and region would have missed out the legacy benefits of new housing, better transport and a repositioned international profile.\nIn March 2020, British Cycling issued a \"Cycling Facility Assessment\" which stated that building a new velodrome in Birmingham was not considered a \u201chigh priority\u201d and did not have an adequately stable strategic or business case to support such an investment.\nBudget crisis.\nIn September 2018, it was speculated that the games could &lt;a href=\"Bankruptcy\"&gt;bankrupt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20Council\"&gt;Birmingham City Council&lt;/a&gt;. An audit report revealed that the council had an \u00a384 million debt at that time when vast sums of its emergency reserves were spent. The audit report also stated that the city had spent \u00a3116 million in emergency reserves in the previous two years just to run the council and that \u00a352 million in savings were needed for the next complete year. The report also revealed that the council's emergency savings at one point dropped to \u00a372 million. \nIt was decided between the British Government and the council that the government would pay the 75% of the total \u00a3750 million cost of hosting the games while the rest 25% would be covered by the city council which is nearly \u00a3180 million. While the council was ready to cover the Games' 25% cost, some members of the council believed that covering such cost could put the council into very heavy debt. Some feared that Birmingham, being Europe's largest local authority with an annual budget of \u00a33 billion, could face insolvency in the next few years if its finances were not improved. Councillor Meirion Jenkins, the shadow cabinet member for resources and finance, described Birmingham City Council's financial position as \u201cvery poor\u201d and said the situation was not helped by hosting the upcoming Commonwealth Games. Council leader Ian Ward denied that the Games would bankrupt the authority. The council admitted that they would have to cut \u00a35 million for Birmingham Children's Trust which supported disadvantaged children, and \u00a31.6 million from transport for the mobility-impaired and concessionary travel for old people and children. In order to save funds, the council planned to cut \u00a32.4 million from the service for adults who suffer life-changing events and shut 21 children's centres. Ward said that they were working on their budget proposals for the next year such that the Games could provide a positive legacy to the city and the &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20%28region%29\"&gt;West Midlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to avoid to bankruptcy, Birmingham City Council proposed to impose a 'hotel tax', to help pay 25% cost for the Commonwealth Games. A hotel tax could mean charging hotel visitors in Birmingham \u00a31 per night, potentially raising \u00a315 million over three years to help fund the Games.\nAthletes' village.\nCost.\nDuring the Birmingham City Council cabinet meeting of 11 February 2020, the council's draft financial plan showed that the Athletes' Village in &lt;a href=\"Perry%20Barr\"&gt;Perry Barr&lt;/a&gt; would not be built within its estimated \u00a3492.6 million cost. The financial plan also explained that the cost pressure was due to the \"constrained timescales\" to build the village and hence its expected cost might increase. The Athletes' Village was expected to house over 6,500 athletes and officials during the Games, before being converted into 1,400 homes for the community as part of a long-term regeneration plan for Perry Barr known as the Perry Barr Regeneration Scheme. \nDuring a budget consultation, over 255 people submitted views where 11 per cent of the comments urged the authority to reduce or cease funding for the Commonwealth Games. Councillor Rob Alden (&lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20Erdington%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Erdington&lt;/a&gt;), leader of the &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; opposition, said that the council must decide the accurate cost of the games. Council leader Ian Ward commented that the British Government had prevented the authority from being transparent about the full cost of the Games and said promises of help to mitigate the financial pressure of hosting the event 'had not been forthcoming'. He also added that the Perry Barr Regeneration Scheme would be monitored and reviewed to ensure it was progressing in line with relevant goals, targets, time-scales and costs.\nOn 10 March 2020, it was reported that the cost of the Athletes Village would rise to \u00a391.8 million due to its construction cost price inflation and increased demand for building workers, as said by the Birmingham City Council. Due to cost pressures, the bed space requirement of the village was reduced from 6,500 to 6,320. The city council also announced it would aim to lower the additional \u00a3 91.8 million costs by \u00a325 million by undertaking legacy retrofit and demolition after the Games, while both plots 2 and 11 of the project would be delivered later. Birmingham MP &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Sambrook\"&gt;Gary Sambrook&lt;/a&gt; (Conservative), also a city councillor, commented that the &lt;a href=\"British%20Government\"&gt;British Government&lt;/a&gt; should take over the charge for the delivery of the athlete's village as the city council was not able to manage the budget.\nReplacement.\nThe BOCCG announced on 11 August 2020 that the athletes' village which was due to be accommodated in the new Perry Barr housing development, had been abandoned. The decision was taken due to the ongoing &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and associated lockdown, which had interrupted construction work. Athletes and team officials will instead be housed in three \u2018campus\u2019 villages, at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Birmingham\"&gt;University of Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Warwick\"&gt;University of Warwick&lt;/a&gt;, and The &lt;a href=\"National%20Exhibition%20Centre\"&gt;NEC&lt;/a&gt; Hotel Campus.\nThe athletes' village was originally planned on the site of the former &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20University\"&gt;Birmingham City University&lt;/a&gt; campus as part of the Perry Barr regeneration scheme, which as of September 2020 is under construction and was planned to be completed by 2022. The Australian firm &lt;a href=\"Lendlease\"&gt;Lendlease&lt;/a&gt; is constructing the campus at a cost of \u00a3350 million The Athletes Village was planned to be home to over 6,500 athletes and officials, and to be converted into 1,400 homes for the community following the Games. It was also the largest infrastructure project directly related to the Games. The campus was designed by the British firms Glancy Nicholls Architects and &lt;a href=\"Glenn%20Howells\"&gt;Glenn Howells&lt;/a&gt; Architects.\nSporting programme.\nShooting.\nIn January 2018, CEO of the CGF David Grevemberg confirmed that &lt;a href=\"Shooting%20sports\"&gt;Shooting&lt;/a&gt;, which is an optional sport according to the CGF constitution, would not feature at the 2022 Commonwealth Games as the organising committee of the Games decided to exclude the sport. This sparked an anger among the athletes from India and the &lt;a href=\"Indian%20Olympic%20Association\"&gt;Indian Olympic Association&lt;/a&gt; (IOA) as India performed well in shooting during the &lt;a href=\"2018%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;previous edition&lt;/a&gt; of the Games at Gold Coast in 2018 by winning 16 medals, including 7 golds. The &lt;a href=\"National%20Rifle%20Association%20of%20India\"&gt;National Rifle Association of India&lt;/a&gt; (NRAI) president &lt;a href=\"Raninder%20Singh\"&gt;Raninder Singh&lt;/a&gt; was unhappy with the decision of removal of shooting and wanted the Indian government to boycott the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Meanwhile, the IOA requested the CGF and the Organising Committee of the 2022 Commonwealth Games to include Shooting in the event. On 20 June 2019, during the CGF board meeting in &lt;a href=\"Birmingham\"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, the CGF confirmed that the Shooting sport has been excluded from the 2022 Commonwealth Games as no suitable venue has been found in the host city Birmingham and in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Midlands%20%28region%29\"&gt;West Midlands region&lt;/a&gt;. On 27 July 2019, IOA president Narinder Batra wrote a letter to the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Sports%20%28India%29\"&gt;Indian Sports Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kiren%20Rijiju\"&gt;Kiren Rijiju&lt;/a&gt; to discuss about the boycott of the 2022 Games as the organising committee did not add shooting in the Games. In regarding to protest, Batra said that the IOA has pulled out from the CGF General Assembly which was held in &lt;a href=\"Kigali\"&gt;Kigali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rwanda\"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; in September 2019 and also the IOA had withdrawn the nomination of its secretary general Rajeev Mehta for the election of a regional vice-president as well as that of Namdev Shiragaonkar for sports committee member in CGF. Batra also commented that the CGF has an \"India bashing mindset\" and \"try to change rules\" whenever the country (India) does well in the Commonwealth Games.\nOn 30 July 2019, Ian Reid, CEO of Birmingham 2022 said that shooting was not included in Birmingham's bid and that in September 2018, five sports that were not included in the original bid \u2013 shooting, archery, beach volleyball, para table tennis and cricket \u2013 expressed their desire to be part of the Games. He also stated that the Birmingham 2022 Board was committed to conducting a review, offering each sport a chance to be included and the process they conducted was fair, logical and transparent and the assessment panel included senior representatives from key Games Partners including Birmingham 2022, &lt;a href=\"Department%20for%20Digital%2C%20Culture%2C%20Media%20and%20Sport\"&gt;Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20Games%20England\"&gt;Commonwealth Games England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%20City%20Council\"&gt;Birmingham City Council&lt;/a&gt;. Shooting scored highly on some of the key criteria and the Panel recognised the submission from the &lt;a href=\"International%20Shooting%20Sport%20Federation\"&gt;International Shooting Sport Federation&lt;/a&gt; (ISSF), the &lt;a href=\"International%20Confederation%20of%20Fullbore%20Rifle%20Associations\"&gt;International Confederation of Fullbore Rifle Associations&lt;/a&gt; (ICFRA) and British Shooting (BS). But the Panel determined that the proposed location for shooting at &lt;a href=\"National%20Shooting%20Centre\"&gt;National Shooting Centre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bisley%2C%20Surrey\"&gt;Bisley, Surrey&lt;/a&gt; which is 130 miles away from Birmingham, offered very little benefit to the West Midlands, in a Games with a significant proportion of funding coming from the region.Bisley had been used when Manchester staged the Games in 2002. The Panel did offer the opportunity for the sport to submit an alternative Birmingham based proposal \u2013 most likely two disciplines in one Birmingham venue \u2013 but the ISSF, ICFRA and BS were not ready to submit a proposal that did not include all four disciplines in a single Bisley-based venue. As a result of that review, Birmingham 2022 proposed adding three sports \u2013 women's cricket, para table tennis and beach volleyball \u2013 all of which could be staged in venues in Birmingham or the West Midlands and could bring additional benefits to the region.\nOn 14 November 2019, President of the CGF &lt;a href=\"Louise%20Martin%20%28sports%20administrator%29\"&gt;Louise Martin&lt;/a&gt; and Chief Executive of the CGF David Grevemberg met with Narinder Batra, Kiren Rijiju and other IOA officials in &lt;a href=\"Delhi\"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the exclusion of shooting and to find a solution. Afterwards, Martin revealed that the CGF team would attend the ISSF Extraordinary General Assembly in &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; in December 2019 to discuss how the sport can be involved in the 2022 Games. Narinder Batra revealed they would wait for the meeting between the CGF and the ISSF before taking any decision on whether to boycott the 2022 Games in Birmingham. Later, the NRAI expressed its commitment to hosting a shooting competition in India before Birmingham 2022 and endorsed the idea of the IOA to allow medals won there to count towards the overall 2022 Commonwealth Games table even though as with the Olympics, a medals table is discouraged in the Commonwealth Games. On 30 December 2019, the IOA announced in its Annual General Meeting in Delhi that they will participate in the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and will also bid for the &lt;a href=\"2026%20Commonwealth%20Games\"&gt;2026&lt;/a&gt; or 2030 Commonwealth Games.\nIn January 2020 it was proposed that shooting and archery competitions would take place in India some time before the Birmingham Games but count in the medal table. The ISSF and the World Archery supported the decision. It was announced that CGF would review the decision of inclusion of shooting and archery with the Games partners by January or February 2020. In an interview with the &lt;a href=\"BBC%20Sport\"&gt;BBC Sport&lt;/a&gt;, British Sports Minister &lt;a href=\"Nigel%20Adams\"&gt;Nigel Adams&lt;/a&gt; commented that prospect of India missing the 2022 Commonwealth Games over the absence of shooting was \"absolutely bonkers\". He also told that he was \"delighted\" India was appeased through the possibility of hosting its own events four months before the Games begin. \nOn 4 February 2020, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lords\"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt; endorsed India's proposal to host the additional shooting and archery events for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. On 24 February 2020, the CGF announced that they had accepted the India's proposal of hosting the archery and shooting events in India for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, but the two sports will be conducted as a separate event called as the &lt;a href=\"2022%20Commonwealth%20Shooting%20and%20Archery%20Championships\"&gt;Commonwealth Archery and Shooting Championships&lt;/a&gt;, which will be hosted in &lt;a href=\"Chandigarh\"&gt;Chandigarh&lt;/a&gt; in January 2022. The CGF also confirmed that the medals won in the championships will be counted in the final medal table of the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Grevemberg claimed that such proposals could be replicated in future Commonwealth Games.\nCoronavirus outbreak.\nPreparations delay.\nThe Birmingham City Council had found that the preparations of the Games could be affected due to the worldwide &lt;a href=\"COVID-19%20pandemic\"&gt;coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The council revealed that the Games preparations, which include the construction of the Athletes' Village and the demolition of the Perry Barr flyover, could possibly face unexpected delays, due to a 20 per cent reduction in the workforce.\nSchedule clash.\nThe &lt;a href=\"2020%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;2020 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2020%20Summer%20Paralympics\"&gt;Paralympics&lt;/a&gt;, due to be held from 23 July to 3 August and 25 August to 6 September respectively in 2020 in &lt;a href=\"Tokyo\"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, were postponed by one year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new dates were confirmed on 30 March 2020 by the &lt;a href=\"International%20Olympic%20Committee\"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; (IOC), &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Organising%20Committee%20of%20the%20Olympic%20and%20Paralympic%20Games\"&gt;Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tokyo%20Metropolitan%20Government\"&gt;Tokyo Metropolitan Government&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"International%20Paralympic%20Committee\"&gt;International Paralympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; (IPC). Other sporting events which were going to be held in 2021 were postponed or planned to be postponed to next year in order to avoid clash with the Olympics and Paralympics. It was speculated that the postponement of the &lt;a href=\"2022%20World%20Athletics%20Championships\"&gt;2021 World Athletics Championships&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eugene%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Eugene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2021%20World%20Aquatics%20Championships\"&gt;2021 World Aquatic Championships&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fukuoka\"&gt;Fukuoka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, to 2022 could clash with the dates of the 2022 Commonwealth Games. If the dates clash, then the top athletes from &lt;a href=\"Track%20and%20field\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swimming%20%28sport%29\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; could miss the Games in order to participate in the World Championships. The CGF said they were in talks with the &lt;a href=\"World%20Athletics\"&gt;World Athletics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FINA\"&gt;International Swimming Federation&lt;/a&gt; (FINA) to avoid the clashing of World Championships with the Commonwealth Games. \nOn 3 April 2020, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Athletics\"&gt;World Athletics&lt;/a&gt; announced that the World Athletic Championships in &lt;a href=\"Eugene%2C%20Oregon\"&gt;Eugene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, planned to be held from 6 to 15 August in 2021, was postponed to 15 to 24 July in 2022. The new dates were chosen in such a way that the Championships doesn't clash with the 2022 Commonwealth Games. On 4 May 2020, FINA announced that the World Aquatic Championships in &lt;a href=\"Fukuoka\"&gt;Fukuoka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Japan\"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, planned to be held from 16 July to 1 August 2021, was postponed to 13 to 29 May 2022."
