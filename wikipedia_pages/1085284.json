Rediff.com said, \"Ajay Devgan pulls up an ace with a part tailormade to reinforce his seething-under-the-surface angry hero image.

To a great extent, his presence covers up the film's patchiness in the second half.\" Devgn was nominated for the &lt;a href=\"Filmfare%20Best%20Actor%20Award\"&gt;Filmfare Best Actor Award&lt;/a&gt; for this performance.

The film was released on 23 January 2004. It received positive reviews and became one of the highest-grossing films of 2004. In \"Khakee\", Devgn once again played a villain. His performance as a police officer turned murderer was well received by critics. Taran Adarsh said: \"Ajay Devgan adds yet another feather in his cap with a performance that could've been played only by a master performer. His confrontations with Amitabh Bachchan are exemplary.\" Later in 2004, Devgn appeared in &lt;a href=\"Indra%20Kumar\"&gt;Indra Kumar&lt;/a&gt;'s \"\". He also starred in \"&lt;a href=\"Yuva\"&gt;Yuva&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDevgn next collaborated with &lt;a href=\"Rituparno%20Ghosh\"&gt;Rituparno Ghosh&lt;/a&gt; in the relationship drama \"&lt;a href=\"Raincoat%20%28film%29\"&gt;Raincoat&lt;/a&gt;\", with Aishwaraya Rai. The film is an adaptation of &lt;a href=\"O.%20Henry\"&gt;O. Henry&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gift%20of%20the%20Magi\"&gt;The Gift of the Magi&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Raincoat\" met with wide critical acclaim and won the &lt;a href=\"National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Feature%20Film%20in%20Hindi\"&gt;National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi&lt;/a&gt;. Devgn was praised for his performance. Rediff said: \"Hesitation, desperation, humiliation \u2013 Ajay Devgn conveys them eloquently. His Manoj is no cool dude, but just another lower middle-class guy in misery, with whom none would like to switch place. He particularly stands out in the scenes where he cries in the bathroom, or begs Neeru not to marry someone else.\" In 2004, Devgn was also seen in a cameo appearance in \"\".\n2005 was a less successful year for Devgn. His movies were not financially successful. They included \"&lt;a href=\"Insan\"&gt;Insan&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Blackmail%20%282005%20film%29\"&gt;Blackmail&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Main%20Aisa%20Hi%20Hoon\"&gt;Main Aisa Hi Hoon&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Tango%20Charlie\"&gt;Tango Charlie&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Shikhar%20%28film%29\"&gt;Shikhar&lt;/a&gt;\". However, the films \"&lt;a href=\"Kaal\"&gt;Kaal&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Apaharan\"&gt;Apaharan&lt;/a&gt;\" did well. For his performance in \"Apaharan\", Devgn was nominated for the &lt;a href=\"National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor\"&gt;National Film Award for Best Actor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Filmfare%20Best%20Actor%20Award\"&gt;Filmfare Best Actor Award&lt;/a&gt;. His performance as a villain in \"Kaal\" also earned him a nomination for the &lt;a href=\"Filmfare%20Best%20Villain%20Award\"&gt;Filmfare Best Villain Award&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2006 Devgn played &lt;a href=\"Othello\"&gt;Othello&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Omkara%20%282006%20film%29\"&gt;Omkara&lt;/a&gt;\", an Hindi adaptation of &lt;a href=\"William%20Shakespeare\"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Othello\"&gt;Othello&lt;/a&gt;\". It was directed by &lt;a href=\"Vishal%20Bhardwaj\"&gt;Vishal Bhardwaj&lt;/a&gt;. The film is a tragedy of sexual jealousy set against the backdrop of the political system in &lt;a href=\"Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;. It premiered at the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;2006 Cannes Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; and was screened at the &lt;a href=\"Cairo%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Cairo International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. \"Omkara\" was well received by critics. Rediff said: \"Othello is a tricky role, a leading man eclipsed by the villain. Yet the Moor is a brooding and compelling character, and Ajay Devgn does valiantly with his material. Omkara strips Othello of the racism, exchanging his black skin for surprisingly inconsequential half-Brahminism. Ajay's best bits are when restrained, and while there is a bit of a seen-that feel to his character, by the time the film is over, you realise just how unflinchingly solid he's been.\" Taran Adarsh said: \"Ajay makes a stirring and powerful interpretation of a man haunted by uncertainty about his lover's faithfulness. The serious look that Ajay carries suits him to the T. Of course, Ajay is exceptional in the film and looks every inch the character he portrays.\"\nIn 2006, Devgn also starred in &lt;a href=\"Rohit%20Shetty\"&gt;Rohit Shetty&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Golmaal%20%282006%20film%29\"&gt;Golmaal&lt;/a&gt;\".

The film is based on the life of activist &lt;a href=\"Safdar%20Hashmi\"&gt;Safdar Hashmi&lt;/a&gt;, who was killed in 1989 by political rivals while performing in the street play \"Halla Bol\". The film received harsh reviews.\nIn 2008, Devgn also performed in &lt;a href=\"Rohit%20Shetty\"&gt;Rohit Shetty&lt;/a&gt;'s third film \"&lt;a href=\"Sunday%20%282008%20film%29\"&gt;Sunday&lt;/a&gt;\".\nHe then took the lead role with Kajol in his own directorial debut film \"&lt;a href=\"U%20Me%20Aur%20Hum\"&gt;U Me Aur Hum&lt;/a&gt;\". The film performed moderately well at the box office and earned positive critical reviews for his performance as well as for his direction. Rediff said: \"His character grows, discovers both shirt-buttons and subtlety, delivering an intense acting job. Speaking almost entirely in platitudes \u2013 pithy at first, profound as he goes on \u2013 this grows into an extraordinarily well-written character, replete with flaws and relatability. The way he treats his remorse, drunkenly pointing every finger at himself around a dinner table, is superbly handled, as is his guilty struggle to delineate his life experience from his professional opinion.\" Devgn also made a cameo appearance in his brother &lt;a href=\"Anil%20Devgan\"&gt;Anil Devgan&lt;/a&gt;'s film \"&lt;a href=\"Haal%E2%80%93e%E2%80%93dil\"&gt;Haal\u2013e\u2013dil&lt;/a&gt;\".

He then featured in &lt;a href=\"Prakash%20Jha\"&gt;Prakash Jha&lt;/a&gt;'s political thriller \"&lt;a href=\"Raajneeti\"&gt;Raajneeti&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Raajneeti\" was released internationally on 4 June 2010, after some controversies regarding similarities between actual people and the characters in the film.

Both the film and Devgn's performance were well received by the critics. &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Adarsh\"&gt;Taran Adarsh&lt;/a&gt; said: \"Ajay Devgn is splendid as Sultan. The actor had enacted a similar role in \"Company\", but it must be said that his interpretation is so different in \"Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai\". He adds so much depth to the character, which only goes to prove his range and versatility. This is, without a trace of doubt, Ajay's finest work so far.\" &lt;a href=\"Komal%20Nahta\"&gt;Komal Nahta&lt;/a&gt; said: \"Ajay Devgn is simply fantastic in the role of Sultan Mirza. So real is his performance that it looks like he was born to play this role. Right from his look to his acting including dialogue-delivery, everything is fabulous. Indeed, an award-winning performance!\"\nDevgn then starred in &lt;a href=\"Priyadarshan\"&gt;Priyadarshan&lt;/a&gt;'s action-thriller film \"&lt;a href=\"Aakrosh%20%282010%20film%29\"&gt;Aakrosh&lt;/a&gt;\".

Ajay is well known for the lines, \"aataa maajhi satakli\". The embodiment of screen masculinity, Ajay enacts the central character of a righteous, hardhearted cop with flourish. He brings alive on screen a larger-than-life hero character with determined conviction, which renders you thunderstruck. One of the few actors who underplays his part admirably, he returns to the over-the-top-action genre of films with this one.
