    "text": "Little Buffalo Creek is a tributary of &lt;a href=\"Buffalo%20Creek%20%28West%20Branch%20Susquehanna%20River%29\"&gt;Buffalo Creek&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Union%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Union County, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, in the United States. It is approximately long and flows through &lt;a href=\"White%20Deer%20Township%2C%20Union%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;White Deer Township&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kelly%20Township%2C%20Union%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Kelly Township&lt;/a&gt;. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is impacted by nutrients, sediment, E. coli, and thermal radiation. Rock formations containing sandstone, shale, and limestone occur in the watershed.\nMost of the watershed of Little Buffalo Creek is on forested land or agricultural land, but there are other land uses as well. A number of bridges have been constructed over the creek. In 2014, a $329,851 grant from the Growing Greener program was issued to the Union County Conservation District for agricultural best management practices in its watershed. The creek's drainage basin is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery and wild trout naturally reproduce in a reach of it. &lt;a href=\"American%20eel\"&gt;American eel&lt;/a&gt;s have also been released into the creek.\nCourse.\nLittle Buffalo Creek begins at the base of a mountain in White Deer Township. It flows south for a short distance before turning east-northeast and then east-southeast. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, the creek turns east-northeast for a few miles before turning south-southeast and entering a valley. After several tenths of a mile, it turns south and enters Kelly Township. The creek continues flowing south for some distance before meandering east for several tenths of a mile. It then turns south again for a few tenths of a mile before turning southwest. The creek then turns south-southeast, then east-northeast, before finally turning southwest. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, it reaches its confluence with Buffalo Creek.\nLittle Buffalo Creek joins Buffalo Creek upstream of its mouth.\nHydrology.\nLittle Buffalo Creek is impacted by &lt;a href=\"nutrient%20pollution\"&gt;nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sediment\"&gt;sediment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"E.%20coli\"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"thermal%20radiation\"&gt;thermal radiation&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2000, the sediment load in Little Buffalo Creek was , while in 2008, it was . This equates to a unit area load of around . However, in the future, the sediment load could be reduced by 66.94 percent to per year. The largest contributors of sediment to the creek in 2000 were streambank &lt;a href=\"erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt; () and &lt;a href=\"row%20crop\"&gt;row crop&lt;/a&gt;s (). Hay and pastures contributed and low-density urban land contributed . came from other sources.\nIn 2000, the &lt;a href=\"nitrogen\"&gt;nitrogen&lt;/a&gt; load of Little Buffalo Creek was and in 2008, it was . This equates to a unit area load of just under . However, in the future, the annual load could be reduced by 39.11 percent to .\nThe &lt;a href=\"phosphorus\"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt; load of Little Buffalo Creek was in 2000, while in 2008, it was . This equates to a unit area load of less than . However, in the future, the phosphorus load could be reduced by 66.94 percent to per year.\nGeography and geology.\nThe elevation near the &lt;a href=\"river%20mouth\"&gt;mouth&lt;/a&gt; of Little Buffalo Creek is above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;. The elevation of the creek's &lt;a href=\"river%20source\"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; is between above sea level.\nThere are of fencing and of stabilization along streams in the watershed of Little Buffalo Creek. There are also significant &lt;a href=\"flood\"&gt;flood&lt;/a&gt;-prone areas along the creek, which, during a flood, could make access to emergency services in western Kelly Township difficult. There are some &lt;a href=\"floodplain\"&gt;floodplain&lt;/a&gt; areas along the creek and its tributaries.\nLittle Buffalo Creek cuts through the Buffalo Mountain Anticlinal. Additionally, the Milton Anticlinal is located near the creek.\nOutcroppings of the Ore &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; are visible at the Buffalo Mountain Anticlinal on Little Buffalo Creek. &lt;a href=\"Shale\"&gt;Shale&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Bloomsburg%20Formation\"&gt;Bloomsburg Formation&lt;/a&gt; also occur in the watershed of the creek. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"limestone\"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Helderberg%20Formation\"&gt;Lower Helderberg Formation&lt;/a&gt; occurs near the creek.\nWatershed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"drainage%20basin\"&gt;watershed&lt;/a&gt; of Little Buffalo Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Geological%20Survey\"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; quadrangle of Lewisburg. However, the source is in the &lt;a href=\"quadrangle%20%28geography%29\"&gt;quadrangle&lt;/a&gt; of Williamsport SE. The creek also flows through the quadrangle of Allenwood. It is one of the major tributaries of Buffalo Creek. The watershed makes up 14 percent of the Buffalo Creek drainage basin and is in the northeastern corner of that watershed.\nThere are of streams in the watershed of Little Buffalo Creek. Of these, are in agricultural land. Forested land is more common in the watershed's upper reaches, while agricultural land is more common in the lower reaches. The creek does not flow through any protected areas, but its headwaters are not far from &lt;a href=\"state%20forest\"&gt;state forest&lt;/a&gt; lands. There are no major highways in the watershed, but &lt;a href=\"Interstate%2080\"&gt;Interstate 80&lt;/a&gt; passes close to its northeastern edge.\nA total of 54 percent of the watershed of Little Buffalo Creek is on &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;ed land. Another 37 percent is on &lt;a href=\"agriculture\"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt; land. Only 3 percent of the watershed is impervious, but this could rise to 26 percent in the future. The watershed contains of row crops and of &lt;a href=\"hay\"&gt;hay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pasture\"&gt;pasture&lt;/a&gt;s. A total of of agricultural land in the watershed is on slopes of more than 3 percent. There are patches of commercial and residential land in the creek's watershed.\nThere are no unpaved roads in the watershed of Little Buffalo Creek.\nHistory.\nLittle Buffalo Creek was entered into the &lt;a href=\"Geographic%20Names%20Information%20System\"&gt;Geographic Names Information System&lt;/a&gt; on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1179489.\nA &lt;a href=\"gristmill\"&gt;gristmill&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"sawmill\"&gt;sawmill&lt;/a&gt; were built on Little Buffalo Creek during the winter of 1774 to 1775. The Hubbler Bridge, which is also known as the Lewisburg Penitentiary Bridge, is located on Little Buffalo Creek west of &lt;a href=\"Lewisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Lewisburg&lt;/a&gt;. It is on private property. A bridge built over the creek in 1850 was used as a route for transporting grain to Campbell's Mill.\nA bridge carrying T-404 over Little Buffalo Creek was built before 1977. It is west of &lt;a href=\"New%20Columbia%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;New Columbia&lt;/a&gt; and is long. A bridge carrying State Route 1003 was built over the creek north of &lt;a href=\"Kelly%20Cross%20Roads%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Kelly Cross Roads&lt;/a&gt; in 1934. This bridge is long and was repaired in 1983. Another bridge carrying that road was built over the creek north of Kelly Cross Roads in 1936 and is long. A two-span bridge was built across the creek south of Kelly Cross Roads in 1949, was repaired in 2002, and is long. In 1950, a bridge carrying State Route 1004 was constructed over the creek in Kelly Cross Roads and is long. In 1951, a bridge carrying State Route 1006 was built over Little Buffalo Creek in northeast of Kelly Cross Roads and is long.\nA bridge with a length of was built across Little Buffalo Creek in 1985 and carries State Route 1003 west of &lt;a href=\"Kelly%20Point%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Kelly Point&lt;/a&gt;. A bridge with a length of was built over the creek in 1991 and carries T-391 east of Kelly Point.\nIn the 2008 report, the watershed of Little Buffalo Creek was ranked fourth amongst several sub-watersheds in the Buffalo Creek drainage basin for restoration priority. In 2014, the a $329,851 grant from the &lt;a href=\"Growing%20Greener\"&gt;Growing Greener&lt;/a&gt; program was issued to the &lt;a href=\"Union%20County%20Conservation%20District\"&gt;Union County Conservation District&lt;/a&gt; for agricultural best management practices in the creek's watershed.\nBiology.\nThe drainage basin of Little Buffalo Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild &lt;a href=\"trout\"&gt;trout&lt;/a&gt; naturally reproduce on a reach of the creek from the T442 bridge downstream to the second State Route 1006 bridge. This reach is long. A group of spawning &lt;a href=\"white%20sucker\"&gt;white sucker&lt;/a&gt;s were observed in the creek in the 1920s.\nA population of &lt;a href=\"American%20eel\"&gt;American eel&lt;/a&gt;s was released into Little Buffalo Creek in 2013. The eels also carried with them the larvae of &lt;a href=\"freshwater%20mussel\"&gt;freshwater mussel&lt;/a&gt;s. The aim of the project was to restore American eels and freshwater mussels to the &lt;a href=\"ecosystem\"&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Susquehanna%20River\"&gt;Susquehanna River&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a 2008 study, Little Buffalo Creek was found to be less biologically impaired than expected given the amount of agricultural activity and &lt;a href=\"livestock\"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt; in its watershed. Additionally, some &lt;a href=\"wetland\"&gt;wetland&lt;/a&gt;s have been created along the creek by landowners to serve as &lt;a href=\"waterfowl\"&gt;waterfowl&lt;/a&gt; habitats and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture\"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; has installed &lt;a href=\"riparian%20buffer\"&gt;riparian buffer&lt;/a&gt;s on the creek in some formerly agricultural land.\nThe &lt;a href=\"pathogen\"&gt;pathogen&lt;/a&gt; load of Little Buffalo Creek is 6.646 \u00d7 1015 organisms per month. 5.684 \u00d7 1015 of those organisms come from urban areas, while 9.564 \u00d7 1014 come from farm animals and 3.214 \u00d7 1012 come from &lt;a href=\"septic%20system\"&gt;septic system&lt;/a&gt;s. The remaining 2.182 \u00d7 1012 come from wild animals."
