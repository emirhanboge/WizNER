The event is highly popular for spectacular fireworks and a massive show celebrating the end of the school year: &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmZ3Wv0xscJQ%26quot%3BScarlet\"&gt;Sails\" celebration in St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;\nThis tradition began here after the end of World War II, when schools united to celebrate the ending of a school year in connection with symbolism of the popular children's book \"Scarlet Sails\" by &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Grin\"&gt;Alexander Grin&lt;/a&gt;. At that time a boat with scarlet sails was sailing along the English Embankment and the Admiralty Embankment towards the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Palace\"&gt;Winter Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Although it was designed to update the rusty revolutionary propaganda, the \"Scarlet Sails\" tradition has become a popular public event, annually celebrating the ending of the school year in June. The \"Scarlet sails\" appearance is now the most popular part of the White Nights celebration.\nThe popularity of both the book and the tradition was boosted after the 1961 release of the movie titled \"Alye parusa\" (\"&lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Sails%20%28film%29\"&gt;Scarlet sails&lt;/a&gt;\" in English), starring &lt;a href=\"Anastasiya%20Vertinskaya\"&gt;Anastasiya Vertinskaya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vasily%20Lanovoy\"&gt;Vasily Lanovoy&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarnivals of the White Nights.\nA series of carnivals take place during the White Nights Festival in St. Petersburg. The largest and most internationally renowned carnival takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Petergof\"&gt;Peterhof&lt;/a&gt; suburb of St. Petersburg. There actors dressed in period costumes from the times of &lt;a href=\"Peter%20the%20Great\"&gt;Peter the Great&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20the%20Great\"&gt;Catherine the Great&lt;/a&gt; give performances reproducing some of the historic events of that period. Period carriages are ridden around the Peterhof park as part of the carnival.\nCarnivals at the &lt;a href=\"Catherine%20Palace\"&gt;Catherine Palace&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Pavlovsk%2C%20Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Pavlovsk&lt;/a&gt; suburb of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; are renowned for their highly artistic reproduction of the historic events that took place at those palaces. Period carriages are driven around the Catherine park as part of the carnival entertainment.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Palace%20Square\"&gt;Palace Square&lt;/a&gt; in St. Petersburg serves as a natural stage for numerous carnival events and appearances showing period costumes of the Tsars and Tsarinas.\nStar performances at the Palace Square.\nEvery summer in St. Petersburg the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20Square\"&gt;Palace Square&lt;/a&gt; becomes a stage for international stars of popular music. This wide square has been used for official military parades and massive demonstrations, as well as for political events and large-scale shows and other entertainment. The most recent appearances were those of &lt;a href=\"Paul%20McCartney\"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Rolling%20Stones\"&gt;The Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scorpions%20%28band%29\"&gt;Scorpions&lt;/a&gt; and other stars.\nStar appearances are usually connected with the White Nights, though some appearances may not coincide with the time of the White Nights Festival because of individual schedules or other reasons (such as the postponement of The Rolling Stones' appearance in 2006 owing to the temporary disability of &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Richards\"&gt;Keith Richards&lt;/a&gt;). In July 2007, they played their show in front of the Tsar's &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Palace\"&gt;Winter Palace&lt;/a&gt; before a crowd of 50 thousand Russian fans.\nMarathon.\nSince 1990, the festival has included the &lt;a href=\"White%20Nights%20International%20Marathon\"&gt;White Nights International Marathon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"10K%20run\"&gt;10K run&lt;/a&gt; through the streets of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Petersburg\"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;. More than 5,000 runners take part each year.\nWhite Nights Festival in the media.\nSeveral film festivals take place around the time of the White Nights Festival.\nDuring the entire season of the White Nights the St. Petersburg news media, newspapers and television are focused on the White Nights Festival, showcasing its numerous events"
