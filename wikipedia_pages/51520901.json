Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez composed five of the songs on this album including the title track and he is also the album's executive producer.\n\"Acar\u00edciame El Coraz\u00f3n\" includes ballads, rhythmic songs and rancheras, and is \"very close\" to \"&lt;a href=\"Hasta%20el%20fin%20del%20mundo\"&gt;Hasta el fin del mundo&lt;/a&gt;\" (2014), explained the artist in an interview with international media.\n\"Presenting a new album always fills me with hope, enthusiasm and commitment to the public, which in some way or another has followed me during the 38 years of my career,\" Fern\u00e1ndez said.\nProduced \"with much affection\" along with &lt;a href=\"Jorge%20Avenda%C3%B1o%20L%C3%BChrs\"&gt;Jorge Avenda\u00f1o&lt;/a&gt;, the album \"can fulfill all the tastes\" of his followers thanks to the variety of styles, Fern\u00e1ndez states.\nBackground.\nFern\u00e1ndez said his new production will be \"completely different\" because among its fourteen songs it includes one song previously unreleased, two songs each with two versions in &lt;a href=\"banda%20music\"&gt;banda&lt;/a&gt; style and five videos, as well as an artistic renewal.\nBeing a CD + DVD it has two songs with alternate versions in Banda style. The single \"Si Tuviera Que Decirlo\" (If I had to say it), as well as five videos that were filmed at Rancho La Fortaleza located in Nuevo Le\u00f3n M\u00e9xico.\nIn the song, \"Si Tuviera Que Decirlo\" (If I had to say it), about love, Fern\u00e1ndez adopts the romantic aspect that has characterized his artistic career, with lyrics such as: \"If I had to say it, I would like to say I love you, you are the greatest thing in my life, you are the air I breathe\".\n\"All my albums are very inclined to the romantic part, but without leaving aside the rhythmic and mischievous part that the public always likes,\" he added.\nIn that sense, Fern\u00e1ndez detailed that songs such as El Tao Tao, the unpublished Carmen or the banda version of \u201cEl Facilito\u201d, a song that he considered \"very entertaining and very funny\", respond to this most mischievous character.\nThe album also features two versions of \"Duele Ver\" (It hurts to see), one of them recorded in the Banda genre, \"it is always important to comply with this genre that has so much growth today,\" he said."
