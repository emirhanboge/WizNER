    "text": "Thulendi is a village in &lt;a href=\"Bachhrawan\"&gt;Bachhrawan&lt;/a&gt; block of &lt;a href=\"Rae%20Bareli%20district\"&gt;Rae Bareli district&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uttar%20Pradesh\"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"India\"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. It is located 6\u00a0km from Bachhrawan, the block headquarters, on an elevated plain with &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;ey soil. A historic village, Thulendi served as a &lt;a href=\"pargana\"&gt;pargana&lt;/a&gt; headquarters from the early 1400s until the late 1700s, and it has several old monuments including a fort built under the &lt;a href=\"Jaunpur%20Sultanate\"&gt;Jaunpur Sultanate&lt;/a&gt; and two large &lt;a href=\"Temple%20tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s othat are said to be even older. As of 2011, Thulendi's population is 6,616, in 1,195 households.\nThulendi hosts a fair on the first Friday in &lt;a href=\"Jeth\"&gt;Jeth&lt;/a&gt; in honour of the 11th-century Muslim folk hero &lt;a href=\"Ghazi%20Sayyid%20Salar%20Masud\"&gt;Ghazi Sayyid Salar Masud&lt;/a&gt;. Pilgrims bring banners and rest here for one night before proceeding to &lt;a href=\"Satrikh\"&gt;Satrikh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bahraich\"&gt;Bahraich&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThulendi was supposedly founded by a &lt;a href=\"Bhar\"&gt;Bhar&lt;/a&gt; chieftain named Thula. It was then supposedly conquered from the Bhars by Malik Taj-ud-Din, a companion of the 11th-century Muslim folk hero &lt;a href=\"Ghazi%20Sayyid%20Salar%20Masud\"&gt;Ghazi Sayyid Salar Masud&lt;/a&gt;. Malik Taj-ud-Din supposedly called the place \"Maliknagar\" and constructed the two large mud-built tanks in the village (one on the north side and the other on the south) called the \"bara hauz\" and the \"chhota hauz\". He was killed by the resurgent Bhars when they retook Thulendi, and his tomb is still extant.\nIn the early 1400s, &lt;a href=\"Ibrahim%20Shah\"&gt;Ibrahim Shah&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Jaunpur%20Sultanate\"&gt;Jaunpur Sultanate&lt;/a&gt; made Thulendi the seat of a &lt;a href=\"pargana\"&gt;pargana&lt;/a&gt;. The old mud fort in Thulendi was built in 820 &lt;a href=\"Hijri%20year\"&gt;AH&lt;/a&gt;, during Ibrahim Shah's reign. Thulendi remained seat of a pargana until the late 1700s, under &lt;a href=\"Asaf-ud-Daula\"&gt;Asaf-ud-Daula&lt;/a&gt;, when the governor Raja Niwaz Singh relocated the headquarters to &lt;a href=\"Bachhrawan\"&gt;Bachhrawan&lt;/a&gt;. Raja Niwaz Singh built a large &lt;a href=\"haveli\"&gt;haveli&lt;/a&gt; in Thulendi that is still standing. He also built a &lt;a href=\"Caravanserai\"&gt;sarai&lt;/a&gt;, but it was in ruins by the early 1900s.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Thulendi was described as a large village or small town, surrounded by orchards and possessing several sites of historical interest. It had two masonry mosques, five temples of Mahadeo, a large primary school, and a bazar that held markets on Thursdays and Sundays. Its population in 1901 was 2,976, including 944 Muslims; the most prominent Hindu groups were the &lt;a href=\"Pasi%20%28caste%29\"&gt;Pasi&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Brahmin\"&gt;Brahmin&lt;/a&gt;s, and the Muraos.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1961%20Census%20of%20India\"&gt;1961 census&lt;/a&gt; recorded Thulendi as comprising 7 hamlets, with a total population of 2,888 people (1,391 male and 1,497 female), in 624 households and 581 physical houses. The area of the village was given as 2,304 &lt;a href=\"acre\"&gt;acre&lt;/a&gt;s and it had a post office at the time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"1981%20Census%20of%20India\"&gt;1981 census&lt;/a&gt; recorded Thulendi as having a population of 3,968 people, in 870 households, and having an area of 929.97 &lt;a href=\"hectare\"&gt;hectare&lt;/a&gt;s."
