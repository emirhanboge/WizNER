    "text": "A liqueur (; ; ) is an &lt;a href=\"alcoholic%20drink\"&gt;alcoholic drink&lt;/a&gt; composed of &lt;a href=\"Liquor\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; (often &lt;a href=\"rectified%20spirit\"&gt;rectified spirit&lt;/a&gt;) and additional flavorings such as &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fruit\"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"spice\"&gt;spice&lt;/a&gt;s. Often served with or after &lt;a href=\"dessert\"&gt;dessert&lt;/a&gt;, they are typically heavily sweetened and un-aged beyond a resting period during production, when necessary, for their flavors to mingle.\nLiqueurs are historical descendants of &lt;a href=\"herbal%20medicine\"&gt;herbal medicine&lt;/a&gt;s. They were made in &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; as early as the 13th century, often prepared by &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s (for example, &lt;a href=\"Chartreuse%20%28liqueur%29\"&gt;Chartreuse&lt;/a&gt;). Today they are produced all over the world, commonly served neat, over ice, with &lt;a href=\"coffee\"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"cocktails\"&gt;cocktails&lt;/a&gt;, and used in &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt;.\nEtymology.\nThe French word \"liqueur\" is derived from the Latin \"liquifacere\", which means \"to dissolve\".\nIn some parts of the United States and Canada, liqueurs may be referred to as cordials, or &lt;a href=\"schnapps\"&gt;schnapps&lt;/a&gt;. This can cause confusion as in the &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Squash%20%28drink%29\"&gt;cordial&lt;/a&gt; would refer to a non-alcoholic concentrated fruit syrup, typically diluted to taste and consumed as a non-carbonated &lt;a href=\"soft%20drink\"&gt;soft drink&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Schnapps\"&gt;Schnapps&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, can refer to any distilled beverage in Germany and &lt;a href=\"Akvavit\"&gt;aquavit&lt;/a&gt; in Scandinavian countries.\nLegal definitions.\nIn the United States and Canada, where spirits are often called \"liquor\" (), there is often confusion discerning between liqueurs and liquors, due to the many different types of flavored spirits that are available today (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Vodka%20infusion\"&gt;flavored vodka&lt;/a&gt;). Liqueurs generally contain a lower &lt;a href=\"Ethanol\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; content (15\u201330% &lt;a href=\"ABV\"&gt;ABV&lt;/a&gt;) than spirits and it has sweetener mixed, while some can have an ABV as high as 55%.\nCanada.\nUnder the Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870), liqueurs are produced from mixing alcohol with plant materials. These materials include juices or extracts from fruits, flowers, leaves or other plant materials. The extracts are obtained by soaking, filtering or softening the plant substances. A sweetening agent should be added in an amount that is at least 2.5 percent of the finished liqueur. The alcohol percentage shall be at least 23%. It may also contain natural or artificial flavoring and color.\nEuropean Union.\nThe European Union directive on &lt;a href=\"Liquor\"&gt;spirit drinks&lt;/a&gt; provides guidelines applicable to all liqueurs. As such, a liqueur must\nUnited States.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alcohol%20and%20Tobacco%20Tax%20and%20Trade%20Bureau\"&gt;Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau&lt;/a&gt; regulates liqueurs similarly to Canada, requiring that alcohol be mixed with plant products and sweeteners be added to at least 2.5% by weight.\nPreparation.\nSome liqueurs are prepared by &lt;a href=\"infusion\"&gt;infusing&lt;/a&gt; certain woods, fruits, or &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s in either water or &lt;a href=\"ethanol\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and adding sugar or other items. Others are &lt;a href=\"distillation\"&gt;distilled&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"aroma\"&gt;aroma&lt;/a&gt;tic or flavoring agents.\n&lt;a href=\"Anise\"&gt;Anise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rak%C4%B1\"&gt;Rak\u0131&lt;/a&gt; liqueurs have the property of turning from transparent to cloudy when added to water: the oil of anise remains in solution in the presence of a high concentration of alcohol, but coalesces when the alcohol concentration is reduced; this is known as the &lt;a href=\"ouzo%20effect\"&gt;ouzo effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse.\nCocktails.\nLiqueurs are sometimes mixed into cocktails to provide flavor.\nLayered drinks.\n&lt;a href=\"Layered%20drink\"&gt;Layered drink&lt;/a&gt;s are made by floating different-colored liqueurs in separate layers. Each liqueur is poured slowly into a glass over the back of a spoon or down a glass rod, so that the liquids of different densities remain unmixed, creating a striped effect."
