    "text": "The 1981 U.S. Open was the 81st &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt;, held June 18\u201321 at the East Course of &lt;a href=\"Merion%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Merion Golf Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ardmore%2C%20Pennsylvania\"&gt;Ardmore, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb northwest of &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"David%20Graham%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;David Graham&lt;/a&gt; won his second &lt;a href=\"Men%27s%20major%20golf%20championships\"&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; title and became the first &lt;a href=\"Australia\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n to win the U.S. Open, three strokes ahead of runners-up &lt;a href=\"George%20Burns%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;George Burns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Rogers%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Bill Rogers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a first round 66, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Thorpe%20%28golfer%29\"&gt;Jim Thorpe&lt;/a&gt; made history as the first African-American since &lt;a href=\"1896%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1896&lt;/a&gt; to lead the U.S. Open. Burns took a one-stroke lead over Graham with a 66 in the second round, then increased his lead to three strokes after 54 holes.\nIn the final round on Sunday, Graham shot one of the most precise rounds in U.S. Open history. He hit every green in regulation, missed just one fairway, and recorded four birdies, missing several other opportunities from within . The only bogey was a three-putt at the fifth, after his approach shot stopped above the hole. After a string of eight pars, Graham finally passed Burns with birdies at the 14th and 15th holes. Graham carded a 67 to Burns' 73 to win by three strokes. Rogers shot 69 to tie Burns for 2nd and won the &lt;a href=\"1981%20Open%20Championship\"&gt;British Open&lt;/a&gt; four weeks later.\nThis was the fourth U.S. Open played at Merion, all at its East Course. Previous editions were hosted in &lt;a href=\"1934%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1934&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1950%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1950&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"1971%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt;. At , the same length as 1971, it was the shortest U.S. Open course since &lt;a href=\"1947%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;1947&lt;/a&gt;. With heavy rains softening the course before the tournament, 93 rounds of par 70 or better were recorded. Fifteen players were under par after 36 holes, but only five finished under par for the four rounds. Five more were at even par 280, including defending champion &lt;a href=\"Jack%20Nicklaus\"&gt;Jack Nicklaus&lt;/a&gt;, a four-time winner.\nAfter 1981, the U.S. Open was not played at Merion until &lt;a href=\"2013%20U.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29\"&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;.\nCourse layout.\nEast Course \nLengths of the course for previous U.S. Opens:\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 18, 1981\"\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 19, 1981\"\nAmateurs: \"Rassett (E)\", Norton (+8), &lt;a href=\"Corey%20Pavin\"&gt;Pavin&lt;/a&gt; (+9), DeFrancesco (+10), White (+10), &lt;a href=\"Joey%20Sindelar\"&gt;Sindelar&lt;/a&gt; (+11), &lt;a href=\"Brad%20Faxon\"&gt;Faxon&lt;/a&gt; (+12), Lawrence (+14), Sanchez (+14), Moore (+15), &lt;a href=\"Jodie%20Mudd\"&gt;Mudd&lt;/a&gt; (+15), Yokoi (+15), Biancalana (+16), Jones (+16), Ludwig (+16), &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20Magee\"&gt;Magee&lt;/a&gt; (+17), Hurter (+21), &lt;a href=\"John%20Brodie\"&gt;Brodie&lt;/a&gt; (+22).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 20, 1981\"\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 21, 1981\"\nAmateur: Rassett (+14).\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative playoff scores, relative to par\""
