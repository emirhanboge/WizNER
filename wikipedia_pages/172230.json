    "text": "West Coast blues is a type of &lt;a href=\"blues\"&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt; music influenced by &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jump%20blues\"&gt;jump blues&lt;/a&gt;, with strong &lt;a href=\"piano\"&gt;piano&lt;/a&gt;-dominated sounds and jazzy guitar solos, which originated from &lt;a href=\"Texas%20blues\"&gt;Texas blues&lt;/a&gt; players who relocated to &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; in the 1940s. West Coast blues also features smooth, honey-toned vocals, frequently crossing into &lt;a href=\"rhythm%20and%20blues\"&gt;rhythm and blues&lt;/a&gt; territory.\nTexas and the West Coast.\nThe towering figure of West Coast blues may be the guitarist &lt;a href=\"T-Bone%20Walker\"&gt;T-Bone Walker&lt;/a&gt;, famous for the song \"&lt;a href=\"Call%20It%20Stormy%20Monday%20%28But%20Tuesday%20Is%20Just%20%20as%20Bad%29\"&gt;Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)&lt;/a&gt;\", a relocated Texan, who made his first recordings in the late 1920s. In the early 1940s, Walker moved to &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, where he recorded many enduring sides for &lt;a href=\"Capitol%20Records\"&gt;Capitol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20%26amp%3B%20White%20Records\"&gt;Black &amp; White&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Records\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;. Walker was a crucial figure in the electrification and urbanization of the blues, probably doing more to popularize the electric guitar in the form than anyone else. Much of his material had a distinct jazzy jump blues feel, an influence that would characterize much of the most influential blues to emerge from &lt;a href=\"California\"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; in the 1940s and 1950s. \nOther Texas bluesmen followed: the pianist and songwriter &lt;a href=\"Amos%20Milburn\"&gt;Amos Milburn&lt;/a&gt;, the singer &lt;a href=\"Percy%20Mayfield\"&gt;Percy Mayfield&lt;/a&gt; (who would later become famous for the song \"&lt;a href=\"Hit%20the%20Road%20Jack\"&gt;Hit the Road Jack&lt;/a&gt;\"), and &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Brown%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Charles Brown&lt;/a&gt; moved to Los Angeles. The guitarist &lt;a href=\"Pee%20Wee%20Crayton\"&gt;Pee Wee Crayton&lt;/a&gt; divided his time between Los Angeles and &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lowell%20Fulson\"&gt;Lowell Fulson&lt;/a&gt;, from Texas by way of &lt;a href=\"Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, moved to &lt;a href=\"Oakland%2C%20California\"&gt;Oakland&lt;/a&gt;."
