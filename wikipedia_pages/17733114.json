    "text": "Woodford is a suburban town in &lt;a href=\"East%20London\"&gt;east&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, within the &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;ceremonial county&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20London\"&gt;Greater London&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Historic%20counties%20of%20England\"&gt;ancient county&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Essex\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;. It is divided into the neighbourhoods of &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20Green\"&gt;Woodford Green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20Bridge\"&gt;Woodford Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20Wells\"&gt;Woodford Wells&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"South%20Woodford\"&gt;South Woodford&lt;/a&gt;. The town is situated north-east of &lt;a href=\"Charing%20Cross\"&gt;Charing Cross&lt;/a&gt;.\nWoodford historically formed an &lt;a href=\"ancient%20parish\"&gt;ancient parish&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Becontree%20Hundred\"&gt;Becontree hundred&lt;/a&gt; of Essex. It contained a string of agrarian villages and was part of &lt;a href=\"Epping%20Forest\"&gt;Epping Forest&lt;/a&gt;. From about 1700 onwards, it became a place of residence for affluent people who had business in London; this wealth, together with its elevated position, has led to it being called the \"Geographical and social high point of East London\".\nToday part of the &lt;a href=\"London%20Borough%20of%20Redbridge\"&gt;London Borough of Redbridge&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Districts%20of%20England\"&gt;local government district&lt;/a&gt; of Greater London, the &lt;a href=\"civil%20parish\"&gt;civil parish&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20Urban%20District\"&gt;Woodford&lt;/a&gt; became an &lt;a href=\"Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29\"&gt;urban district&lt;/a&gt; in 1894, which in 1934 merged with the neighbouring urban district of &lt;a href=\"Wanstead%20Urban%20District\"&gt;Wanstead&lt;/a&gt; to form a &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20Borough%20of%20Wanstead%20and%20Woodford\"&gt;municipal borough&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"London%20Government%20Act%201963\"&gt;1965&lt;/a&gt;, following reform of local government in London, the municipal borough was abolished, becoming part of the borough of Redbridge and Greater London.\nThe area is served by two stations on the &lt;a href=\"Central%20line%20%28London%20Underground%29\"&gt;Central line&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"London%20Underground\"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20tube%20station\"&gt;Woodford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Woodford%20tube%20station\"&gt;South Woodford&lt;/a&gt;. A third station, &lt;a href=\"Roding%20Valley%20tube%20station\"&gt;Roding Valley&lt;/a&gt;, just across the boundary with neighbouring &lt;a href=\"Buckhurst%20Hill\"&gt;Buckhurst Hill&lt;/a&gt; also serves the residents of the northernmost part of Woodford.\nHistory.\nToponymy.\nWoodford appears in the 1086 &lt;a href=\"Domesday%20Book\"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt; as \"Wdefort\", although its earliest recorded use is earlier in 1062 as \"Wudeford\". The name is &lt;a href=\"Old%20English\"&gt;Old English&lt;/a&gt; and means 'ford in or by the wood'. The ford refers to where a minor Roman road from London crossed the &lt;a href=\"River%20Roding\"&gt;River Roding&lt;/a&gt;, which was replaced with a bridge by 1238; this led to the renaming of part of the district as &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20Bridge\"&gt;Woodford Bridge&lt;/a&gt; by 1805. The old Saxon road, that followed the valley at this point and utilised this ford, skirted the forest (which was to the north). The Saxon Road eventually reached north of the Forest and branched East and West at that point. Woodford by this chance was on the trade route to the further parts of Essex. \nPart of the district, in a similar fashion, gained the contemporary name of &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20Green\"&gt;Woodford Green&lt;/a&gt; by 1883. An earlier name which has acted as an alternative to this was Woodford Row.\nEconomic development.\nThe beginnings of Woodford can be traced to a medieval settlement which developed around the ford. Woodford was never a single village, rather it was a collection of hamlets, and has retained to some extent its portmanteau nature. The parish was controlled from Saxon times up to the 16th century by the Abbot of Waltham and the first known reference to a church in Woodford dates from the 12th century. After the &lt;a href=\"Dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries\"&gt;dissolution&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Waltham%20Abbey%20Church\"&gt;Waltham Abbey&lt;/a&gt; in 1540, the monastic lands passed to laymen. London has been central to Woodford's development. The easy access to &lt;a href=\"Epping%20Forest\"&gt;Epping Forest&lt;/a&gt;, a large forest near London where members of the royal family traditionally hunted has made it attractive to Londoners since the Fifteenth Century, when wealthy Londoners started to build mansions there. Woodford provided attractive estates for London merchants and retired &lt;a href=\"East%20India%20Company\"&gt;East India Company&lt;/a&gt; officials who built large houses there. As a consequence, many of the recorded inhabitants would have been servants, and there is even evidence of Africans ('negroes') living in Woodford in the eighteenth century. In fact the domestic servants and wealthy Londoners may have quickly outnumbered the remnant of the local, original rural folk.\nAn example of the kind of grand house typical of pre-19th century Woodford is \"Hurst House\", also known as 'The Naked Beauty', which stands on Salway Hill, now part of Woodford High Road. Its central block was completed in the early 18th century, and its side wings were added later on in the same century. It was restored in the 1930s, only to be damaged by fire a few years later. The central block was again completely restored, with the minor wings you can still see added on.\nHistorians have pointed out Woodford's historic roads as evidence of its 'residential nature', as these roads provided reasonably easy access to Woodford, but no further on. There were two roads to Woodford, the 'lower road' (now &lt;a href=\"Chigwell\"&gt;Chigwell&lt;/a&gt; Road) and the 'upper road' (now Woodford New Road). The 'lower road' was often beset by flooding from the Roding, as it still is today, and was continually considered to be in need of repair. In fact one of the illustrious persons to be inconvenienced by the road was &lt;a href=\"James%20I%20of%20England\"&gt;King James I&lt;/a&gt;. The 'upper road', being less used than the 'lower road' was probably in a worse condition, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Middlesex\"&gt;Middlesex&lt;/a&gt; and Essex Turnpike Trust\" undertook its repair and overhaul in 1721, and extended it to &lt;a href=\"Whitechapel\"&gt;Whitechapel&lt;/a&gt;. The Trust did such a fine job it was given responsibility for the 'lower road' as well. In 1828, the Trust built the 'Woodford New Road' from &lt;a href=\"Walthamstow\"&gt;Walthamstow&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20Wells\"&gt;Woodford Wells&lt;/a&gt;, and was soon after connected to the newly built &lt;a href=\"Epping%2C%20Essex\"&gt;Epping&lt;/a&gt; New Road.\nLocal government.\nThe parish was controlled from Saxon times up to the 16th century by the Abbot of Waltham and the first known reference to a church in Woodford dates from the 12th century. The ancient parish of Woodford, also known as \"Woodford St Mary\" after its parish church of &lt;a href=\"St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Woodford\"&gt;St Mary's&lt;/a&gt;, formed part of the &lt;a href=\"Becontree%20%28hundred%29\"&gt;Becontree&lt;/a&gt; hundred of &lt;a href=\"Essex\"&gt;Essex&lt;/a&gt;. It was suburban to London and formed part of the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Police%20District\"&gt;Metropolitan Police District&lt;/a&gt; from 1840. For administration of the &lt;a href=\"Poor%20Law\"&gt;Poor Law&lt;/a&gt; it was grouped into the &lt;a href=\"West%20Ham\"&gt;West Ham&lt;/a&gt; Union in 1835. The parish adopted the &lt;a href=\"Local%20Government%20Act%201858\"&gt;Local Government Act 1858&lt;/a&gt; in 1873, setting up a local board of nine members. The &lt;a href=\"Local%20Government%20Act%201894\"&gt;Local Government Act 1894&lt;/a&gt; reconstituted its area as &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20Urban%20District\"&gt;Woodford Urban District&lt;/a&gt;, governed by Woodford Urban District Council. In 1934 the urban district was abolished under a &lt;a href=\"Local%20Government%20Act%201929\"&gt;county review order&lt;/a&gt; and its former area became part of the &lt;a href=\"Municipal%20Borough%20of%20Wanstead%20and%20Woodford\"&gt;Wanstead and Woodford Urban District&lt;/a&gt;. Wanstead and Woodford was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1937. The population of the Woodford parish was 2,774 in 1851, and had grown substantially to 37,702 in 1951. In 1965 Wanstead and Woodford, together with &lt;a href=\"Ilford\"&gt;Ilford&lt;/a&gt;, were grouped together to become the London Borough of Redbridge.\nSuburban expansion.\nThe beginnings of the actual modern suburbanisation of Woodford, however, can be traced to the opening (in 1856) of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Counties%20Railway\"&gt;Eastern Counties Railway&lt;/a&gt; Line from &lt;a href=\"Stratford%2C%20London\"&gt;Stratford&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Loughton\"&gt;Loughton&lt;/a&gt;, on which Woodford became accessible by two stations, at &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20tube%20station\"&gt;Snakes Lane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Woodford%20tube%20station\"&gt;George Lane&lt;/a&gt;. The new convenience of transportation encouraged the growth in number of the daily commuter that is typical of the Woodford resident today. Woodford soon became the residence of the well-to-do city worker, as attested by &lt;a href=\"John%20Marius%20Wilson\"&gt;John Marius Wilson&lt;/a&gt; in his \"&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Gazetteer%20of%20England%20and%20Wales\"&gt;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&lt;/a&gt;\", written between 1870 and 1872\nIn fact Woodford doubled its population in the middle and later decades of the 19th century due to the arrival of the railway. A good barometer of Woodford's rapid growth in this period is the erection of three churches in the area, a Congregational, Methodist and Church of All Saints, all built in 1874.\nWoodford completed its suburbanisation in the period between the two World Wars of the 20th century. Available land was hungrily built on and the grand houses of the wealthy who had been building them for more than four hundred years were pulled down to make way for the middle class housing estates, typified by the three-to-four bedroom semi-detached house with front and back gardens. In the 1930s, 1,600 houses were being built in Woodford a year on average. The Central line's extension to and past Woodford in the middle of the 20th century, utilising the existing overland train network, solidified Woodford's place in the commuter belt.\nMilitary activity.\nIn the First World War (1914-1918) London was troubled by Zeppelin Raids. A response to this was to place two Royal Flying Corps night-fighter squadrons, 39 and 37 squadrons, with headquarters at Woodham Mortimer and Woodford Green respectively, with up to eight aircraft at each airfield (generally Bleriot Experimental BE2c). They formed part of the London Air Defence Area. 39 squadron shot down the Cuffley airship SL11 in September 1916, and was possibly the more successful in the task, but 37 squadron destroyed the airship L48 over Norfolk in June 1917.\nRural persistence.\nWoodford, as part of Epping Forest was one of the last places in London where medieval Commoner's rights persisted - with local farmers being allowed to graze their cattle on the common land. These rights were protected by sections 14 and 15 of the Byelaws passed by the Conservators of Epping Forest. Even late into the 20th century cattle were allowed to roam freely on the forest ground (Forest, in this instance being the term applying to the district rather than that area with trees).\nThe practice became increasingly less well suited to the times, as they occasionally penetrated into neighbouring gardens and roads before being driven back onto the forest land.\nThe BSE outbreak of 1996 caused the practice to be halted for a while. Their departure, however, meant that grass and saplings grew on the previously well-cropped meadow areas of forest land. When the cattle were reintroduced in 2001 their range was restricted so that there would be less conflict with other interests.\nPolitics.\nWoodford is divided between three &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;parliamentary&lt;/a&gt; constituencies including &lt;a href=\"Chingford%20and%20Woodford%20Green%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Chingford and Woodford Green&lt;/a&gt; which is currently represented by &lt;a href=\"Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Iain%20Duncan%20Smith\"&gt;Iain Duncan Smith&lt;/a&gt;, who was the Party Leader from 2001 to 2003. Chingford and Woodford Green is separated from &lt;a href=\"Ilford%20North%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Ilford North&lt;/a&gt; by the Central line, whilst a small part of South Woodford is in &lt;a href=\"Leyton%20and%20Wanstead%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Leyton and Wanstead&lt;/a&gt; constituency. Previously the local constituency was &lt;a href=\"Wanstead%20and%20Woodford%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Wanstead and Woodford&lt;/a&gt; (1974\u20131997) and before that &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29\"&gt;Woodford&lt;/a&gt; (1945\u20131974) which was represented by &lt;a href=\"Winston%20Churchill\"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt; between 1945 and 1964. Churchill had previously represented the area (1924-1945) as part of the Epping Parliamentary Constituency - and was therefore Woodford's local MP, both when he was the wartime &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom\"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; - and also later, when he served as a peacetime Prime Minister. Churchill is commemorated by &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Winston%20Churchill%2C%20Woodford\"&gt;a statue&lt;/a&gt; on the green at Woodford.\nNotable people.\nWoodford has connections with major cultural figures. The first is the celebrated writer, artist, craftsman &lt;a href=\"William%20Morris\"&gt;William Morris&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Arts and Crafts Movement, a nineteenth-century revivalist movement dedicated to restoring England's artisan traditions. As a child he lived at &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20Hall\"&gt;Woodford Hall&lt;/a&gt; between 1840 and 1847. Woodford Hall (demolished at the start of the 20th century) stood on Woodford High Road on the site where the Woodford Parish Memorial Hall now is. Another writer who lived in Woodford is &lt;a href=\"James%20Hilton%20%28novelist%29\"&gt;James Hilton&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote the novels \"&lt;a href=\"Goodbye%20Mr%20Chips\"&gt;Goodbye Mr Chips&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Horizon\"&gt;Lost Horizon&lt;/a&gt;\" (in which he coined the term \"Shangri La\") in a semi-detached house at 42 Oak Hill Gardens, which however was in &lt;a href=\"Walthamstow\"&gt;Walthamstow&lt;/a&gt; borough. A blue plaque commemorates his residence at the house.\nThe Clergyman &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Smith\"&gt;Sydney Smith&lt;/a&gt; was born in Woodford in 1771. Smith became a vicar and prominent Reformer, but he is now most famous as a great wit of the early nineteenth century. He was a part of the brilliant intellectual circles of his day, and once said of the historian &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Babington%20Macaulay%2C%201st%20Baron%20Macaulay\"&gt;Macaulay&lt;/a&gt;, \"[He] has occasional flashes of silence, that make his conversation perfectly delightful\". On his position as a Clergyman in Yorkshire, he remarked \"My living in Yorkshire was so far out of the way, that it was actually twelve miles from a lemon\". He compared marriage to \"a pair of shears, so joined that they can not be separated; often moving in opposite directions, yet always punishing anyone who comes between them\". Moreover, Smith published several recipes; his rhyming recipe for salad dressing (\"Let onion atoms lurk within the bowl/And, scarce suspected, animate the whole\") makes him a household name in America to this day.\nWoodford also has connections with the leading &lt;a href=\"Suffragette\"&gt;Suffragette&lt;/a&gt;, peace campaigner and anti-fascist &lt;a href=\"Sylvia%20Pankhurst\"&gt;Sylvia Pankhurst&lt;/a&gt;. Pankhurst was a longtime resident on Charteris Road, close to Woodford Station. She had been introduced to the area by &lt;a href=\"George%20Lansbury\"&gt;George Lansbury&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of the &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; and grandfather of &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Lansbury\"&gt;Angela Lansbury&lt;/a&gt;. Previous to her residence in Charteris Road, Sylvia Pankhurst had challenged the moral codes of her day by living \"in sin\" with an Italian radical on 126 High Road, opposite the &lt;a href=\"Horse%20and%20Well%20Pub\"&gt;Horse and Well Pub&lt;/a&gt;. She renamed the cottage Red Cottage in homage to the leftist activities she carried out from there. She erected an anti-air-warfare monument in protest to the bombing of the people of &lt;a href=\"Ethiopia\"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Benito%20Mussolini\"&gt;Benito Mussolini&lt;/a&gt; on the site of the cottage (the cottage was pulled down in the 1930s).\n&lt;a href=\"Richard%20Warner%20%28botanist%29\"&gt;Richard Warner&lt;/a&gt;, who occupied Harts at Woodford Green, cultivated the first gardenia to flower in England and who in 1771 compiled \"Plantae Woodfordienses - A Catalogue Of The More Perfect Plants Growing Spontaneously About Woodford In The County Of Essex\"\nTransport.\nPublic transport.\nThe &lt;a href=\"London%20Underground\"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Central%20line%20%28London%20Underground%29\"&gt;Central line&lt;/a&gt; serves &lt;a href=\"Woodford%20tube%20station\"&gt;Woodford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Woodford%20tube%20station\"&gt;South Woodford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roding%20Valley%20tube%20station\"&gt;Roding Valley&lt;/a&gt;.
