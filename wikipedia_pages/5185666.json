    "text": "George Arthur Crump, Jr. (September 24, 1871 \u2013 January 24, 1918) was a &lt;a href=\"hotel%20manager\"&gt;hotelier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"golf%20course%20architect\"&gt;golf course architect&lt;/a&gt; primarily known for designing and building &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Valley%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Pine Valley Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;, which, at the time of its opening, was considered the most difficult golf course in the world.\nBiography.\nCrump was born in &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia\"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; in 1871, but spent most of his formative years in &lt;a href=\"Camden%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Camden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merchantville%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Merchantville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Jersey\"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;. He attended local primary and secondary schools and did not attend college. Crump married Isabelle Henry in 1898; at that time, he listed his profession as the 'Hotel Business'. With the hotel in capable hands, Crump was free to pursue &lt;a href=\"golf\"&gt;golf&lt;/a&gt; and within a few years, he was a fanatic, eventually holding memberships at &lt;a href=\"Philadelphia%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Philadelphia Country Club&lt;/a&gt;, St. David's, Torresdale, &lt;a href=\"Huntingdon%20Valley%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Huntingdon Valley Country Club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20City%20Country%20Club\"&gt;Atlantic City Country Club&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1910 Crump and his friend Joseph Baker embarked on a European trip in order to play and study the premier golf courses of Britain and the Continent. Their itinerary included rounds at &lt;a href=\"The%20Royal%20and%20Ancient%20Golf%20Club%20of%20St%20Andrews\"&gt;St Andrews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prestwick%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Prestwick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turnberry%20%28golf%20course%29\"&gt;Turnberry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Liverpool%20Golf%20Club%2C%20Hoylake\"&gt;Hoylake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20St%20George%27s%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Sandwich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Cinque%20Ports%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Deal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%27s%20Golf%20Club%2C%20Sandwich\"&gt;Prince's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunningdale%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Sunningdale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walton%20Heath%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Walton Heath&lt;/a&gt; as well as golf courses in &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Switzerland\"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Pine%20Valley%20Golf%20Club\"&gt;Pine Valley Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;, marshlands had to be drained and approximately 22,000 tree stumps had to be pulled out with special steam-winches and horse-drawn cables. This was all done at a time when many golf courses were still built with minimal earth moving, and the course was called \"Crump's Folly\" by some.\nCrump died on the morning of the January 24, 1918, at his home in Merchantville. The cause of death has been variously reported as &lt;a href=\"suicide\"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; and an infected tooth. At the time of his death four holes\u201412 through 15\u2014were incomplete. Since Crump's death alterations have been made by several other leading golf course designers.\nLegacy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Crump%20Cup\"&gt;Crump Cup&lt;/a&gt;, established in 1922 was named after Crump and is played to this day at Pine Valley Golf Club."
