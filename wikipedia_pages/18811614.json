In late-January 1922, Cypert was nominated for the position of &lt;a href=\"district%20attorney\"&gt;district attorney&lt;/a&gt; in Little Rock. However, it was not until 1926 when Cypert was elected Arkansas Sixth Judicial District Attorney. His constituency covered &lt;a href=\"Pulaski%20County%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Pulaski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Perry%20County%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Perry County, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;. His deputy district attorney was &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Edward%20Bailey\"&gt;Carl Edward Bailey&lt;/a&gt;, who would later go-on to be the &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Arkansas\"&gt;Governor of Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;.

In 1931, Cypert ran for &lt;a href=\"Arkansas%20Attorney%20General\"&gt;Arkansas Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Hal%20Norwood\"&gt;Hal Norwood&lt;/a&gt;, who previously held the office.
