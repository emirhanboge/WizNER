    "text": "Bowdoin National Wildlife Refuge is a &lt;a href=\"National%20Wildlife%20Refuge\"&gt;National Wildlife Refuge&lt;/a&gt; (NWR) located in the north-central region of the U.S. state of &lt;a href=\"Montana\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;. The refuge is northeast of &lt;a href=\"Malta%2C%20Montana\"&gt;Malta, Montana&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Milk%20River%20%28Alberta%E2%80%93Montana%29\"&gt;Milk River&lt;/a&gt; Valley and is managed by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service\"&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBowdoin NWR was previously managed as part of irrigation efforts by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Reclamation\"&gt;U.S. Bureau of Reclamation&lt;/a&gt; to conserve water that would flow into &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Bowdoin\"&gt;Lake Bowdoin&lt;/a&gt;. The seasonal floods from spring snow melt created excellent habitat for migratory and nesting waterfowl as well as raptors such as the &lt;a href=\"bald%20eagle\"&gt;bald eagle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"peregrine%20falcon\"&gt;peregrine falcon&lt;/a&gt;. Lake Bowdoin is on both the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Flyway\"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Flyway\"&gt;Pacific Flyway&lt;/a&gt;s used by migratory birds and was well known by locals and naturalists as having the largest numbers of migratory birds in Montana. In an effort to better protect the habitat, Lake Bowdoin and the surrounding region were set aside as a refuge in 1936 and administration passed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nFauna.\nAs of 2008, 263 species of birds have been observed at Bowdoin NWR. Nesting waterfowl include the &lt;a href=\"American%20white%20pelican\"&gt;American white pelican&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"double-crested%20cormorant\"&gt;double-crested cormorant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"great%20blue%20heron\"&gt;great blue heron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"white-faced%20ibis\"&gt;white-faced ibis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"black-crowned%20night%20heron\"&gt;black-crowned night heron&lt;/a&gt;. Waterfowl species such as the &lt;a href=\"northern%20pintail\"&gt;northern pintail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"green-winged%20teal\"&gt;green-winged teal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20wigeon\"&gt;American wigeon&lt;/a&gt; and a number of grebe species including both the &lt;a href=\"Black-necked%20grebe\"&gt;eared&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"western%20grebe\"&gt;western grebe&lt;/a&gt; also nest at the refuge. Several species of gulls such as &lt;a href=\"Franklin%27s%20gull\"&gt;Franklin's gull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ring-billed%20gull\"&gt;ring-billed gull&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"California%20gull\"&gt;California gull&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"passerine\"&gt;passerine&lt;/a&gt; species including the &lt;a href=\"red-winged%20blackbird\"&gt;red-winged blackbird&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"western%20meadowlark\"&gt;western meadowlark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"yellow-headed%20blackbird\"&gt;yellow-headed blackbird&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"American%20goldfinch\"&gt;American goldfinch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"eastern%20kingbird\"&gt;eastern kingbird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lark%20bunting\"&gt;lark bunting&lt;/a&gt; have also been known to nest on the refuge.\nMammal species including the &lt;a href=\"bobcat\"&gt;bobcat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"North%20American%20beaver\"&gt;beaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"raccoon\"&gt;raccoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Plains%20coyote\"&gt;coyote&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"striped%20skunk\"&gt;skunk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"white-tailed%20deer\"&gt;white-tailed deer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pronghorn\"&gt;pronghorn&lt;/a&gt; live on the refuge. After the refuge was first established, the pronghorn were then protected from hunting, allowing their numbers to swell from 7 to 160 individuals during the 1940s. Pronghorn population figures for the early 21st century averaged between 100 and 150 individuals."
