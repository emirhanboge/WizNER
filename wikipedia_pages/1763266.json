    "text": "The 2001\u201302 season was the 105th season of competitive &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland.\nKey events.\nCeltic, domestic treble winners a year earlier, retain their Premier League title.\nAfter failing to win anything the previous season, Rangers won the Scottish Cup and League Cup under their new manager &lt;a href=\"Alex%20McLeish\"&gt;Alex McLeish&lt;/a&gt;.\nAirdrieonians, who narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League as First Division runners-up, went out of business of 1 May with debts of nearly \u00a33million. Later that month, however, a new club representing the town of &lt;a href=\"Airdrie%2C%20North%20Lanarkshire\"&gt;Airdrie&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Airdrie%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Airdrie United&lt;/a&gt; - was formed, with ambitions of gaining Scottish league status for the 2002\u201303 season.\nLivingston, in the Premier League for the first time, finished third and qualified for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Livingston, who were known as &lt;a href=\"Meadowbank%20Thistle\"&gt;Meadowbank Thistle&lt;/a&gt; until relocating from &lt;a href=\"Edinburgh\"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Livingston%2C%20Scotland\"&gt;Livingston&lt;/a&gt; in 1995 and played their first season in their new location as a Third Division club.\nFalkirk avoided relegation from the First Division and Stenhousemuir avoided relegation from the Second as a result of the league losing a member. The vacant place in the Third Division was occupied by &lt;a href=\"Gretna%20F.C.\"&gt;Gretna&lt;/a&gt;, who until then had played in the English non-league system.\nDespite Gretna beating Airdrie United to the vacant league place, Airdrie United still gained a league place for the 2002\u201303 season \u2013 in the Second Division \u2013 as they bought out the debt-ridden club Clydebank.\n&lt;a href=\"Queen%20of%20the%20South%20F.C.\"&gt;Queen of the South&lt;/a&gt; won the Second Division league title for the first time in 51-years since they won the Division B league title in season 1950\u201351. These were the only two occasions that the &lt;a href=\"Dumfries\"&gt;Dumfries&lt;/a&gt; club had won a league title in their history, that was up until they won their third ever league title in season 2012\u201313, when they won the Second Division once again. \nLeague Competitions.\nScottish Premier League.\nThe 2001\u201302 &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Premier%20League\"&gt;Scottish Premier League&lt;/a&gt; was won by &lt;a href=\"Celtic%20F.C.\"&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rangers%20F.C.\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; finished second and therefore qualified for a &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Champions%20League\"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; place alongside Celtic. &lt;a href=\"Livingston%20F.C.\"&gt;Livingston&lt;/a&gt;, in their debut season in Scotland's top division, qualified for the &lt;a href=\"UEFA%20Cup\"&gt;UEFA Cup&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Aberdeen%20F.C.\"&gt;Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"St%20Johnstone%20F.C.\"&gt;St Johnstone&lt;/a&gt; were relegated to the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Football%20League%20First%20Division\"&gt;First Division&lt;/a&gt;.\nScotland national team.\nKey:"
