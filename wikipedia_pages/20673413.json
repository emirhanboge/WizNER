Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng is short for \"Th\u1ec3 d\u1ee5c Th\u1ec3 thao C\u00f4ng t\u00e1c \u0110\u1ed9i\" and was managed by &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng team include 23 people of the cadre from \"The Army Officer College No1\" and was divided into three teams: 11 football, 5 basketball and 6 volleyball players.

Both teams won championships of two A and B classes.\nIn 1956, for the first time, the \"Democratic Republic of Vietnam national football team\" was convened for international duty. At the age of 38, \"Ti Bo\" was still called to the national team along with nine other The Cong players to participate in his first tour in China. He became one of the first players of the Vietnamese team and the oldest Vietnamese national player ever.\nDuring the following years, Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng won the champions in 1956 and 1958. At that time, &lt;a href=\"Haiphong%20FC\"&gt;C\u00f4ng An H\u1ea3i Ph\u00f2ng&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cong%20An%20Ha%20Noi%20FC\"&gt;C\u00f4ng An H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i&lt;/a&gt; has been their main and traditional rival in Northern Vietnam football. Three clubs played are also the founding members in the highest Vietnamese system league in the mid-1950s and became the Big 3 clubs in the early Vietnam football period. In 1950s and 1960s, C\u00f4ng An H\u1ea3i Ph\u00f2ng was far more successful, winning ten championships, including four consecutively from 1965 to 1968, making the club became North Vietnam's record champion. Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng took over the title more than six years later in 1976, when they won their tenth championship in 1970 and also their last nation league trophy.

During that time, the typical generation of The Cong players were \"&lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Th%E1%BA%BF%20Anh%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201949%29\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ebf Anh&lt;/a&gt; (Ba Den), &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Cao%20C%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Cao C\u01b0\u1eddng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quan%20Trong%20Hung\"&gt;Quan Trong Hung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"V%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20Ti%E1%BA%BFn%20D%C5%A9ng\"&gt;V\u01b0\u01a1ng Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Tr%E1%BB%8Dng%20Gi%C3%A1p\"&gt;Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u1ecdng Gi\u00e1p&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vu%20Manh%20Hai\"&gt;Vu Manh Hai&lt;/a&gt;,\"... with the majority being young players who went to long-term training in &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; in 1967 and when they returned home, they were the most outstanding and typical players in the country.\nAfter the country was unified and had the National Championship (the predecessor of the V-League), The Cong has always been the strongest football club in Vietnam with 5 championships. The Cong players have always been the core of the national team and contributed many players in the golden generation of Vietnamese football such as goalkeeper Tran Tien Anh, Do Manh Dung, Nguyen Manh Cuong, and &lt;a href=\"Nguyen%20Hong%20Son\"&gt;Nguyen Hong Son&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Truong%20Viet%20Hoang\"&gt;Truong Viet Hoang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nguyen%20Duc%20Thang\"&gt;Nguyen Duc Thang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pham%20Nhu%20Thuan\"&gt;Pham Nhu Thuan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trieu%20Quang%20Ha\"&gt;Trieu Quang Ha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dang%20Phuong%20Nam\"&gt;Dang Phuong Nam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vu%20Cong%20Tuyen\"&gt;Vu Cong Tuyen&lt;/a&gt;... The Cong was the longest standing team in the V-League until the team was relegated in 2004. (In 1979, The Cong did not participate in the tournament).\nAt that times, &lt;a href=\"Cong%20An%20Ha%20Noi%20FC\"&gt;C\u00f4ng An H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i&lt;/a&gt; was still a main rivals have been the clubs who put up the strongest fight against its national dominance. Matches with CAHN was more than a local derby with many classic wins, draws and losses. Due to Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng being traditionally hard to beat for CAHN though they had no any trophies for a long times.\n2004-2008: Relegation and promoted back.\nIn 2004, exactly 50 years after its foundation, Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng football club finished V-League at 11th place (out of 12) and was relegated to the lower division. \nThe team performed poorly partly due to the policy of not recruiting foreign soldiers, in contrast to all other teams at that time. In the following season, the club changed its name to The Cong Viettel (&lt;a href=\"Viettel%20Group\"&gt;Viettel&lt;/a&gt; is the Army Electronics and Telecommunication Corporation) and is partially managed by this unit. However, many comments suggested that the club should return to its old name.\nOn January 19, 2007, the club finally gained the right to be promoted back to V-League after winning over Tay Ninh 5\u20133. Immediately thereafter, the official team name was reversed back to Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng.\n2009-2010: The end and transfer.\nOn September 22, 2009 (before the 55th anniversary of the establishment of Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng) the Ministry of Defense decided to change Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng to Viettel.\nIn November 2009, the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; decided to remove name \"Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng\" out of football in Vietnam, and transfer all management of football club to &lt;a href=\"Viettel%20Group\"&gt;Viettel&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn September 23, 2011 on the occasion of the 57th anniversary of the establishment of the club, hundreds of officials, players, and fans of all generations who were once members of The Cong decided to launch a \"campaign\" to collect 1 million signatures across the country to petition the Ministry of Defense to regain the title \"Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng\". However, Viettel Telecom Corporation is not very interested in this reception.\nFacing the risk of being dissolved, the acting director of the Center at that time, \"Nguyen Thanh Hai\", asked the leaders of \"Viettel Telecom Corporation\" to allow the maintenance of the \"Viettel Football Center\" and pledged to bring results in a year. In the 2010 football season, the Center's teams reached the final round of the youth tournaments. In 2011, the Center won 1 Gold, 1 Silver and 1 Bronze Medal in youth tournaments, officially gaining the right to exist. In the 2012 football season, the official squad of Viettel Football Center won the championship with the same rank at the Vietnam Third Division Football Championship and won a place in the Second Division since the 2013 season.\nModern era.\nViettel period.\n2010-2018: Promotion.\nNext to 2010 season, the club again switched its name back to Viettel FC, and also voluntarily left the professional football set-up. Instead, the club decided to focus on youth development, and start competing again in the amateur 4th tier of Vietnamese football.\nOn October 26, 2014, the \"General Director of Military Telecommunications Group\" signed the decision \"No. 2294/QD-VTQ-TCNL\" to consolidate the functions and tasks and change the name of \"Viettel Football Training Center\" to \"Viettel Sports Center\".\nIn 2016 the club finally returned to professional football after winning promotion to the V.League 2.\nIn 2018, Viettel F.C. won the V.League 2 championship and went back to the national top tier &lt;a href=\"V.League%201\"&gt;V.League 1&lt;/a&gt;. The football club also wanted to switch back to the formerly name Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng when the tournament started from 2019, but was not agreed yet from the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20of%20Vietnam\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt;, who owned brands name \"Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng\" and were used by their volleyball team \u2013 \"C\u00e2u l\u1ea1c b\u1ed9 b\u00f3ng chuy\u1ec1n Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng\" (Th\u1ec3 C\u00f4ng Volleyball Club). Therefore, the official name of the football club is C\u00e2u l\u1ea1c b\u1ed9 B\u00f3ng \u0111\u00e1 Viettel (Viettel Football Club) and owned by &lt;a href=\"Viettel%20Group\"&gt;Viettel Group&lt;/a&gt;.\n2019-present: Revival.\nIn the 2020 season, Viettel had a race to the championship with &lt;a href=\"Hanoi%20FC\"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrent squad.\n "
