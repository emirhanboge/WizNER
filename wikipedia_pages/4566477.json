    "text": "George II (, Giorgi II), of the &lt;a href=\"Anchabadze\"&gt;Anchabadze (Anosid) dynasty&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"Divan%20of%20the%20Abkhazian%20Kings\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt; from 923 to 957 AD. His lengthy reign is regarded as a zenith of cultural flowering and political power of his realm. Despite being independent and locally titled as a \"&lt;a href=\"Mepe\"&gt;Mepe&lt;/a&gt;\" (king), he is also regarded as \"&lt;a href=\"Exousiastes\"&gt;Exousiastes&lt;/a&gt;\", the title that was addressed to him by &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantines&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeorge II continued the expansionist policy of his predecessor, aiming primarily at unification of Georgia. It took him, however, some time to assume full ruling powers as his half-brother also claimed the crown.\nLife.\nIn 923, King &lt;a href=\"Constantine%20III%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Constantine III of Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt; () died, and George, then George II Abkhazia succeeded him. However, Bagrat, George's youngest brother, also claimed the crown, the latter engineered a coup with the support of a party of nobles, most importantly his father-in-law, &lt;a href=\"Gurgen%20II%20of%20Tao\"&gt;Gurgen II of Tao&lt;/a&gt; (). The conflict lasted for nearly seven years and ended with the sudden death of Bagrat in 930. To secure the allegiance of the local nobility in central Georgia, George appointed his son Constantine as a duke/viceroy of &lt;a href=\"Duchy%20of%20Kartli\"&gt;Kartli&lt;/a&gt; in 923, but the latter too, revolted against him in 926. In response, George entered in Kartli and placed the rock-hewn city of &lt;a href=\"Uplistsikhe\"&gt;Uplistsikhe&lt;/a&gt; under siege. He lured Constantine by treachery and had him blinded and castrated. In the same year, he installed another son, Leon (the future king &lt;a href=\"Leon%20III%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Leon III&lt;/a&gt;), as a duke/viceroy of Kartli.\nGeorge II aided by the rebellious Kakhetian (&lt;a href=\"Gardabani%20%28historic%20district%29\"&gt;Gardabanian&lt;/a&gt; clan) nobles proceeded to campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Kvirike%20II%20of%20Kakheti\"&gt;Kvirike II&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince-bishop\"&gt;Prince-bishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"First%20Kingdom%20of%20Kakheti\"&gt;Kakheti&lt;/a&gt;. He succeeded in dispossessing Kvirike of his principality in the 930s. To secure his supremacy over Kartli, George allied himself with the Georgian &lt;a href=\"Bagrationi%20dynasty\"&gt;Bagratids&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bagratid%20Iberia\"&gt;Tao-Klarjeti&lt;/a&gt;, and gave his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Gurandukht%20of%20Abkhazia\"&gt;Gurandukht&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Gurgen%20of%20Iberia\"&gt;Gurgen Bagrationi&lt;/a&gt; in marriage. Soon Kvirike returned to offensive and incited rebellion in Kartli. George sent a large army under his son, Leon, but the king died amid the expedition, and Leon had to make peace with Kvirike, ending his campaign inconclusively.\nCultural life.\nGeorge was also known as a promoter of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Orthodox Christianity&lt;/a&gt; and a patron of Georgian Christian culture. He helped to establish Christianity as an official religion in &lt;a href=\"Alania\"&gt;Alania&lt;/a&gt;, winning the thanks of &lt;a href=\"Constantinople\"&gt;Constantinople&lt;/a&gt;. In the first half of the 10th century he founded Khopa (&lt;a href=\"Gudauta%20District\"&gt;Gudauta district&lt;/a&gt;) and Kiachi (&lt;a href=\"Ochamchira%20District\"&gt;Ochamchire district&lt;/a&gt;) cathedrals, as well as &lt;a href=\"Martvili%20Monastery\"&gt;Ckhondidi cathedral&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Martvili%20district\"&gt;Martvili district&lt;/a&gt;) to counter the Greek cathedrals, and, by virtue of this, new cathedrals were a mainstay of the central state-power against external and internal enemies.\nCharacter.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Georgian%20Chronicles\"&gt;The Georgian Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;\" describes him:\n\u201c\"He had all the virtues, courage and boldness; was faithful to God, was famous as the builder of the churches, merciful towards the poor, generous, modest, full of noble features and kind\"\u201d.Quote from Byzantine patriarch &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Mystikos\"&gt;Nicholas Mystikos&lt;/a&gt;'s letter addressed to King George, written immediately after his accession on the throne.\u201c\"...You (George), an intelligent, sensible man...\"\u201d\n18th century Georgian historian &lt;a href=\"Vakhushti%20of%20Kartli\"&gt;Vakhushti Bagrationi&lt;/a&gt; describes him:\u201c\"George was the God-Fearing and pious king, stately, bold and courageous, merciful, generous, church builder, kind to orphans and widows\"\u201d.\nFamily.\nGeorge married a certain Helen:"
