    "text": "World federalism or global federalism is a political ideology advocating a &lt;a href=\"Democracy\"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Federalism\"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"world%20government\"&gt;world government&lt;/a&gt;. A world federation would have authority on issues of global reach, while the members of such a federation would retain authority over local and national issues. The overall &lt;a href=\"sovereignty\"&gt;sovereignty&lt;/a&gt; over the world population would largely reside in the federal government.\nWorld federalism is distinguished from &lt;a href=\"Unitary%20state\"&gt;unitary&lt;/a&gt; world government models by the principle of &lt;a href=\"subsidiarity\"&gt;subsidiarity&lt;/a&gt;, where decisions are made as much as possible at the most immediate level, preserving national agency to a large degree. Proponents maintain that a world federation offers a more effective and accountable global governance structure than the existing &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; organization, while simultaneously allowing wide autonomy for national, regional and local governments.\nAdvocacy for world federalism has been largely organized under the &lt;a href=\"World%20Federalist%20Movement\"&gt;World Federalist Movement&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nDistinction to the existing United Nations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; is not a legislative body and is thus limited to a mostly advisory role. Its stated purpose is to foster cooperation between existing &lt;a href=\"nation\"&gt;nation&lt;/a&gt;al governments rather than exert authority over them.\nDistinction to a unitary world government.\nA &lt;a href=\"Unitary%20state\"&gt;unitary&lt;/a&gt; world government would consist of a single, central government body with supreme sovereignty. While administrative subdivisions might exist, their powers are &lt;a href=\"Delegation\"&gt;delegated&lt;/a&gt; by the central government. In a world federation based on subsidiarity, the delegation is the other way round, from local to central. Global federal government is subsidiary to local in that it only does what local government cannot.\nPlans that sought to unify the known world by conquest have historically aimed at a centralized, unitary government, rather than a federal government. World federalists generally do not support violent paths towards a world federation (see )\nDistinction to a world confederation.\nA &lt;a href=\"confederation\"&gt;confederation&lt;/a&gt; is a union of sovereign nations, which are pursuing a common cause. Member states in a confederation are sometimes free to secede from the confederation.\nIn a federation based on subsidiarity, nations choose to give up their sovereignty over global issues they cannot manage to an central authority empowered to manage these issues at the global level. Sovereignty over national issues remains with the nation.\nDifferent forms of federalism can be applied at the global level. \nTraditional federalism is the model adopted by the United States, in which the States relinquish their sovereignty to the federal government, which in turn represents them in front of other nations. It constitutes a centralized model of world federalism.\nThe most decentralized model of world federalism is the confederation of States, or world confederalism, which gives the States a higher degree of power and freedom in which countries preserve their sovereignty, relinquishing to the federal authority only the powers to manage and regulate intergovernmental relationships.\nThe European Union can be considered an example of such system of government, because its Member States preserve their sovereignty even though they relinquish part of it to the community\u2019s authorities in specific matters.\nHistory.\nOrigins of the idea.\nWorld federalism has evolved from more general proposals for a world government. Proposals for a world government can be found as far back as Ancient Greece, India and China, mostly tied to a mystical cosmology. Alexander the Great pursued the goal of conquering the entire known world and subjugating it under his rule. World governments in various forms later appeared in the works of &lt;a href=\"Dante%20Alighieri\"&gt;Dante Alighieri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Immanuel%20Kant\"&gt;Immanuel Kant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anacharsis%20Cloots\"&gt;Anacharsis Cloots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Gottlieb%20Fichte\"&gt;Johann Gottlieb Fichte&lt;/a&gt;, where it was explicitly proposed as a means to securing world peace. A world parliament as integral part of a world republic was mentioned first by &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20Pecqueur\"&gt;Pecqueur&lt;/a&gt; in 1842. The idea has been popularized by a number of prominent authors, such as &lt;a href=\"Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson\"&gt;Alfred Tennyson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"H.%20G.%20Wells\"&gt;H. G. Wells&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe late 19th century has also seen the establishment of a number of international institutions, such as the &lt;a href=\"International%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross\"&gt;International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Telecommunication%20Union\"&gt;Telegraphic Union&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Postal%20Union\"&gt;Universal Postal Union&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Inter-Parliamentary%20Union\"&gt;Inter-Parliamentary Union&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of serving as \"an international congress which should meet periodically to discuss international questions\".\nBefore World War II.\nThe Campaign for World Government was founded in 1937 by pacifists and feminists Rosika Schwimmer and Lola Maverick Lloyd.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Streit%20Council\"&gt;Streit Council&lt;/a&gt; for a Union of Democracies, Inc. is the successor to Federal Union, Inc., founded in 1939 by &lt;a href=\"Clarence%20Streit\"&gt;Clarence Streit&lt;/a&gt;, which works to unite democracies as a path toward greater individual freedom, international solidarity, and global stability; it aims for the creation of an international order of, by and for the people.\nThe rise of nationalism and the growing threat of fascism in Europe caused a resurgence of the idea of a unified world under democratic principles. With the release of the book \"&lt;a href=\"Union%20Now\"&gt;Union Now&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Clarence%20Streit\"&gt;Clarence Streit&lt;/a&gt; proposed a political union of democratic nations. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland were to form the seed for a democratic world republic. A world congress, made up of a House of Representative and a Senate should decide on matters related to defence, trade and currency.\nAfter World War II.\nIn 1947, the Committee to Frame a World Constitution was founded, releasing \"The Preliminary Draft of a World Constitution\" in 1948.\nAlso in 1947, over 50 world federalist organizations formulated the &lt;a href=\"Montreux\"&gt;Montreux&lt;/a&gt; Declaration, encapsulating the demands of the world federalist movement in light WW II:We world federalists are convinced that the establishment of a world federal government is the crucial problem of our time. Until it is solved, all other issues, whether national or international, will remain unsettled. It is not between free enterprise and planned economy, nor between capitalism and communism that the choice lies, but between federalism and power politics. Federalism alone can assure the survival of man.The United World Federalists emerged as the main advocacy group for world federalism in the United States after WWII. The United World Federalists was a non-partisan, non-profit organization with members in forty-eight states, founded in &lt;a href=\"Asheville%2C%20North%20Carolina\"&gt;Asheville&lt;/a&gt;, North Carolina on February 23, 1947 as the result of a merger of five existing world government groups: Americans United for World Government; World Federalists, U.S.A.; Student Federalists; Georgia World Citizens Committee; and the Massachusetts Committee for World Federation. The organization was renamed to World Federalists, USA (1960s), World Federalists Association (1970s) and then &lt;a href=\"Citizens%20for%20Global%20Solutions\"&gt;Citizens for Global Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, which is active to this day.\nGarry Davis.\nIn 1948, &lt;a href=\"Garry%20Davis\"&gt;Garry Davis&lt;/a&gt; entered one of the meetings of the newly founded United Nations General Assembly and gave a short speech before being escorted out of the hall, declaring thatWe, the people, want the peace which only a world government can give.\nThe sovereign states you represent divide us and lead us to the abyss of total war.Garry Davis (\"World Citizen Number One\") founded the &lt;a href=\"World%20Service%20Authority\"&gt;World Service Authority&lt;/a&gt;, promoting the idea of &lt;a href=\"Global%20citizenship\"&gt;world citizenship&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrent proposals for establishing a world federation.\nThere are a number of proposals for the establishment of a world federation:\nReform of the UN and existing institutions:\nRegional Unification:\nOther:\nNumerous books and articles have been written on the practical implementation of world federalist goals.\nA comprehensive analysis and a roadmap to world federalism is presented in the book World Federalist Manifesto, Guide to Political Globalization, in which the author presents a model of world federalism divided into international legislative, executive, judicial and financial branches and the world government shares the authority with Member States, in a way that both are sovereign within their respective sphere of competence. \nThe Earth Constitution, drafted by international legal experts in 1968 and finalized in 1991, outlines a detailed plan for a world federalist government and is promoted today by the Earth Constitution Institute and the World Constitution and Parliament Association. Fourteen sessions of a Provisional World Parliament have been held under the auspices of this proposed system from 1982 to the present and have passed dozens of acts of model legislation on issues of global concern.\nCriticism.\nCriticism of world federalism falls into four broad categories:\nInfeasible.\nThe establishment of a world federation would require extraordinary amounts of coordination and trust from all nations of the world, which are in economic and political competition with each other. Critics argue that world federalism is thus an unreachable utopia.\nProponents of world federalism point to existential crises, such as climate change, war and pandemics, which make global coordination necessary and inevitable.\nUndesirable.\nCritics argue that a concentration of power on a global level would raise the risks and probability of tyranny, deterioration of human rights and cultural homogenization.\nProponents of world federalism point out that democratic and republican principles are at the core of world federalism, which are commonly seen as safeguards against tyranny and oppression in nation states.\nInsufficient.\nCritics argue that the problems world federalism proposes to solve (e.g. climate change, war, pandemics, hunger) are too big to be solved by political means only, i.e. even if a world federation existed, it would not be capable of alleviating these issues.\nWorld federalists argue that these issues originate from the insistence on national sovereignty and the lack of democratic structures at the global level. Effective global governance could therefore deal directly with the root cause of these problems.\nUnnecessary.\nCritics argue that it is unnecessary to establish a world federation to solve global problems. They point to existing structures of global governance, such as international organizations and the United Nations.\nWorld federalists maintain that current structures of global governance are not capable of enforcing decisions, or that they are not democratically representing the world's population.\nIn popular culture.\nA world federation has been mentioned in several works of fiction, along with more general concepts of &lt;a href=\"World%20government%20in%20fiction\"&gt;world government&lt;/a&gt;."
