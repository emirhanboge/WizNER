    "text": "Patriarch Alexy I (Alexius I, , secular name Sergey Vladimirovich Simansky, ; \u2013 17 April 1970) was the 13th &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20of%20Moscow%20and%20all%20Rus%27\"&gt;Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'&lt;/a&gt;, Primate of the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Russian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt; (ROC) between 1945 and 1970.\nLife.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Russian%20nobility\"&gt;noble family&lt;/a&gt;, his father was a &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20%28office%29\"&gt;Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt; of the Russian &lt;a href=\"Romanov\"&gt;Imperial Court&lt;/a&gt;. In 1899 he graduated from &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20State%20University\"&gt;Moscow Imperial University&lt;/a&gt; with a law degree; was conscripted by the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Imperial%20Army\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; and served in a &lt;a href=\"grenadier\"&gt;grenadier&lt;/a&gt; regiment. In 1902 he enrolled at &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Theological%20Academy\"&gt;Moscow Theological Academy&lt;/a&gt; and by 1906 he had been elevated to the dignity of &lt;a href=\"archimandrite\"&gt;archimandrite&lt;/a&gt; and was appointed &lt;a href=\"Rector%20%28academia%29\"&gt;rector&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"seminary\"&gt;seminary&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tula%2C%20Russia\"&gt;Tula&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Bolshevik%20Revolution\"&gt;Bolshevik Revolution&lt;/a&gt; he was arrested several times and in 1922 exiled to &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;. In 1926 he returned to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Petersburg\"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; (which had been renamed Leningrad) and was appointed &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Khutyn\"&gt;Khutyn&lt;/a&gt;, that is, the &lt;a href=\"vicar\"&gt;vicar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Diocese\"&gt;Diocese&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Novgorod\"&gt;Novgorod&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn July 29, 1927, Metropolitan &lt;a href=\"Sergius%20I%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Sergei Stragorodsky&lt;/a&gt;, acting as de facto head of the Russian Orthodox Church, signed a statement of unconditional loyalty to the Soviet State. The statement was co-signed by all members of the Holy Synod, and Archbishop Alexy of Khutyn.\nHe ran the diocese for much of the next seven years while Metropolitan &lt;a href=\"Arsenius%20Stadnitsky\"&gt;Arsenius Stadnitsky&lt;/a&gt; was in prison or exile. In 1933 Alexius served briefly as &lt;a href=\"Diocese%20of%20Novgorod\"&gt;Archbishop of Novgorod&lt;/a&gt; (for several months) and then &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20bishop\"&gt;metropolitan&lt;/a&gt; of Leningrad.\nIn the early hours of September 5, 1943, Metropolitan Alexius together with Metropolitan &lt;a href=\"Patriarch%20Sergius%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Sergius&lt;/a&gt; and Metropolitan &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20%28Yarushevich%29\"&gt;Nicholas (Yarushevich)&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;Joseph Stalin&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Kremlin\"&gt;Kremlin&lt;/a&gt; where a historic decision was made regarding the fate of the Church in the state ruled by the militantly &lt;a href=\"Atheism\"&gt;atheist&lt;/a&gt; Communist party. In the midst of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; Stalin decided to allow the Russian Orthodox Church to legally function again after two decades of severe &lt;a href=\"persecution\"&gt;persecution&lt;/a&gt;. Restrictions on the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Orthodox%20Church\"&gt;Patriarchate of Moscow&lt;/a&gt; were relaxed somewhat and many churches throughout the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; were re-opened. Stalin tried to appeal to patriotic feelings of the Russian people especially the &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;ry (backbone of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Army\"&gt;Red Army&lt;/a&gt;), many of whom grew up in still deeply religious families.\nWhen Patriarch Sergei died on May 15, 1944, Metropolitan Alexy took his place as Patriarchal \"&lt;a href=\"Locum\"&gt;locum tenens&lt;/a&gt;\". In his first statement after assuming control of the Church, the Metropolitan assured Stalin of his \"profound affection and gratitude\" and vowed to \"safeguard the Church against mistakes and false steps\".\nOn February 2, 1945, with Stalin's approval, Alexius I was elected &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20metropolitans%20and%20patriarchs%20of%20Moscow\"&gt;Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia&lt;/a&gt; and enthroned on February 4, 1945.\nIn 1946 Alexius I presided over the controversial \"re-unification\" of the &lt;a href=\"Ukrainian%20Greek%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; with ROC seen by many as a takeover forced by the Stalinist government.\nAlso in 1946, Patriarch Alexius called on all Catholics in the Soviet Union to reject all allegiance to the Pope: \"Liberate yourself! You must break the Vatican chains, which throw you into the abyss of error, darkness and spiritual decay. Hurry, return to your true mother, the Russian Orthodox Church!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Pope%20Pius%20XII\"&gt;Pope Pius XII&lt;/a&gt; replied: \"Who does not know, that Patriarch Alexius I recently elected by the dissident bishops of Russia, openly exalts and preaches defection from the Catholic Church. In a letter lately addressed to the &lt;a href=\"Ruthenian%20Greek%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Ruthenian Church&lt;/a&gt;, a letter, which contributed not a little to the persecution?\"\nPatriarch Alexius joined the &lt;a href=\"World%20Peace%20Council\"&gt;World Peace Council&lt;/a&gt;, \"a Soviet front organization,\" when it was founded in 1949. According to &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Andrew%20%28historian%29\"&gt;Christopher Andrew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vasili%20Mitrokhin\"&gt;Vasili Mitrokhin&lt;/a&gt;, both Patriarch Alexius and Metropolitan Nicholas \"were highly valued by the &lt;a href=\"KGB\"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Agent%20of%20influence\"&gt;agents of influence&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20state%20funeral%20of%20Joseph%20Stalin\"&gt;the death of Stalin&lt;/a&gt; on March 5, 1953, the Patriarch composed a personal statement of condolence to the USSR's Council of Ministers. It read, \"His death is a heavy grief for our Fatherland and for all the people who inhabit it. The whole Russian Orthodox Church, which will never forget his benevolent attitude to Church needs, feels great sorrow at his death. The bright memory of him will live ineradicably in our hearts. Our Church proclaims eternal memory to him with a special feeling of abiding love.\"\nIn 1955, Patriarch Alexius declared, \"The Russian Orthodox Church supports the totally peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union, not because the Church lacks freedom, but because Soviet policy is just and corresponds to the Christian ideals which the Church preaches.\"\nFrom 1959 however, the Russian Orthodox Church also had to endure &lt;a href=\"USSR%20anti-religious%20campaign%20%281958%E2%80%9364%29\"&gt;a new wave of persecution&lt;/a&gt;, mostly carried out on the orders of the new Soviet leader &lt;a href=\"Nikita%20Khrushchev\"&gt;Nikita Khrushchev&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite this, Patriarch Alexius was permitted by the KGB to enroll the Russian Orthodox Church into the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Peace%20Conference\"&gt;Christian Peace Conference&lt;/a&gt; in 1958 and the &lt;a href=\"World%20Council%20of%20Churches\"&gt;World Council of Churches&lt;/a&gt; in 1961.\nIn 1965, Fathers &lt;a href=\"Gleb%20Yakunin\"&gt;Gleb Yakunin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nikolai%20Eshilman\"&gt;Nikolai Eshilman&lt;/a&gt; wrote an &lt;a href=\"open%20letter\"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Patriarch Alexius. According to &lt;a href=\"Evgeny%20Barabanov\"&gt;Evgeny Barabanov&lt;/a&gt;, \"They showed convincingly how a significant part of the governing episcopate, with voluntary silence or cunning connivance, had assisted the Atheists to close churches, monasteries, and religious schools, to liquidate religious communities, to establish the illegal practice of registering christenings, and had yielded to them control over the assignment and transfer of priests.\"\nThe letter was published as \"&lt;a href=\"samizdat\"&gt;samizdat&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"self-published\", i.e., &lt;a href=\"underground%20press\"&gt;underground press&lt;/a&gt;). In May 1966, Patriarch Alexius ordered both priests suspended from the ministry. &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20dissident\"&gt;Soviet dissident&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aleksandr%20Solzhenitsyn\"&gt;Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&lt;/a&gt; sharply criticized the treatment of Fathers Gleb and Nikolai in his own open letter to Patriarch Alexius.\nPatriarch Alexius died of a &lt;a href=\"myocardial%20infarction\"&gt;myocardial infarction&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 92 in 1970 and was buried in the &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Lavra%20of%20St.%20Sergius\"&gt;Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sergiyev%20Posad\"&gt;Sergiyev Posad&lt;/a&gt; outside of Moscow.\nEvaluation.\nSupporters praise Alexius I for working hard to ensure the survival of the Christianity in Russia, advocating peace and inter-church unity, while opponents often accused him of complicity with the Soviet authorities.\nA leading critic of Patriarch Alexei's leadership is Father &lt;a href=\"Gleb%20Yakunin\"&gt;Gleb Yakunin&lt;/a&gt; who claims in his books and articles that the postwar hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church was controlled by &lt;a href=\"KGB\"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; informants."
