Buchanan was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;College Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 and the &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Pro Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 1990. Buchanan was massive for his era, standing at 6'7\", and weighing 270 lbs. His height gave him a big advantage against lineman in the trenches.\nHigh school years.\nBuchanan attended &lt;a href=\"A.%20H.%20Parker%20High%20School\"&gt;A. H. Parker High School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Birmingham, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, and was a standout in &lt;a href=\"High%20school%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"basketball\"&gt;basketball&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollege years.\nBuchanan attended &lt;a href=\"Grambling%20State%20University\"&gt;Grambling College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; and was a &lt;a href=\"Letterman%20%28sports%29\"&gt;letterman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"College%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"National%20Association%20of%20Intercollegiate%20Athletics\"&gt;NAIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"All-America\"&gt;All-America&lt;/a&gt; selection. He was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;College Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. He is one of four Grambling State players, &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Brown%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Willie Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Willie%20Davis%20%28defensive%20end%29\"&gt;Willie Davis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Joiner\"&gt;Charlie Joiner&lt;/a&gt; coached by &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Robinson%20%28football%20coach%29\"&gt;Eddie Robinson&lt;/a&gt; enshrined in the &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Pro Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.\nProfessional career.\nThe Buchanan was selected in both the NFL and AFL drafts in 1963. The &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Giants\"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt; took him 265th overall in the 19th round of the &lt;a href=\"1963%20NFL%20Draft\"&gt;1963 NFL Draft&lt;/a&gt;, while he was the first overall selection in the &lt;a href=\"1963%20American%20Football%20League%20draft\"&gt;AFL Draft&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"1963%20Kansas%20City%20Chiefs%20season\"&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt;. Eddie Robinson, his coach at Grambling State, where he had been an NAIA All-American in 1962, called him \"the finest lineman I have seen.\" Buchanan was the first black number one draft choice in Professional Football. \nOthers who had watched Buchanan in action were equally enthusiastic. Buchanan had the physical size and athletic instincts to be exceptionally successful. He was particularly effective at intimidating the passer and in &lt;a href=\"1967%20AFL%20season\"&gt;1967&lt;/a&gt; batted down 16 passes at or behind the &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20scrimmage\"&gt;line of scrimmage&lt;/a&gt;. He was clocked at 4.9 in the &lt;a href=\"40-yard%20dash\"&gt;40-yard dash&lt;/a&gt; and 10.2 in the &lt;a href=\"100-yard%20dash\"&gt;100-yard dash&lt;/a&gt; at Grambling State, allowing him to range from sideline to sideline to make &lt;a href=\"Tackle%20%28football%20move%29\"&gt;tackles&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn spite of the weekly pounding he took on the line of scrimmage, Buchanan was extremely durable. He played in 182 career games that included a string of 166 straight. After dabbling briefly at &lt;a href=\"defensive%20end\"&gt;defensive end&lt;/a&gt; as a rookie, Buchanan settled down to his permanent job as the Chiefs' defensive right tackle. He was named to his first &lt;a href=\"AFL%20All-Star%20Game\"&gt;AFL All-Star Game&lt;/a&gt; after his second season and played in six AFL All-Star games and two &lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;AFC&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"National%20Football%20Conference\"&gt;NFC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Bowl\"&gt;Pro Bowl&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHe teamed with &lt;a href=\"Curley%20Culp\"&gt;Curley Culp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Brown%20%28defensive%20lineman%29\"&gt;Aaron Brown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jerry%20Mays%20%28defensive%20lineman%29\"&gt;Jerry Mays&lt;/a&gt; to establish a dominant front four for the Chiefs, culminating in their victory over the &lt;a href=\"Minnesota%20Vikings\"&gt;Minnesota Vikings&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Super%20Bowl%20IV\"&gt;Super Bowl IV&lt;/a&gt;, when they allowed Viking runners only 67 yards rushing in 19 carries and 172 net passing yards, Buchanan in particular dominating the opposing center, &lt;a href=\"Mick%20Tingelhoff\"&gt;Mick Tingelhoff&lt;/a&gt;, a 5-time &lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; first-team &lt;a href=\"All-Pro\"&gt;All-Pro&lt;/a&gt; selection up to that 1969 season, as handily as the left guard, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Vellone\"&gt;Jim Vellone&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was selected to the second team of the &lt;a href=\"American%20Football%20League%20All-Time%20Team\"&gt;AFL All-Time Team&lt;/a&gt;, and was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Alabama%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Alabama Sports Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 1987 and the &lt;a href=\"Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame\"&gt;Pro Football Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; in 1990. Two years later, he died from &lt;a href=\"lung%20cancer\"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 51.\nIn 1999, he was ranked number 67 on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sporting%20News\"&gt;The Sporting News&lt;/a&gt;\"' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, right behind his former Chiefs teammate &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Bell\"&gt;Bobby Bell&lt;/a&gt;. The Chiefs also retired his uniform number 86.\nPersonal life.\nBuchanan was diagnosed with lung cancer a week before his Hall of Fame induction and died at age 51 in his Kansas City home on July 16, 1992.
