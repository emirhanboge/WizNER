    "text": "The history of school and office products brand Westcott dates back to 1872, when Henry Westcott, together with his two sons Charles and Frank Westcott, started manufacturing &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;en &lt;a href=\"furniture\"&gt;furniture&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"Printer%20%28publisher%29\"&gt;printers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Latticework\"&gt;trellis units&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Seneca%20Falls%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;Seneca Falls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20%28state%29\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href=\"Economic%20expansion\"&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; rapidly and became one of the largest &lt;a href=\"Manufacturing\"&gt;manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"desk\"&gt;desk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"school\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ruler\"&gt;ruler&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout its history it remained in Westcott &lt;a href=\"family\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hand\"&gt;hand&lt;/a&gt;s until it was &lt;a href=\"Purchasing\"&gt;purchased&lt;/a&gt; by Acme Shear Co., which later changed its name to &lt;a href=\"Acme%20United%20Corporation\"&gt;Acme United Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause Westcott was such a strong &lt;a href=\"brand\"&gt;brand&lt;/a&gt;, Acme United started selling &lt;a href=\"dozen\"&gt;dozen&lt;/a&gt;s of other school and &lt;a href=\"Office%20supplies\"&gt;office items&lt;/a&gt;, like scissors, pencil sharpeners and paper trimmers under the Westcott name. Nowadays, Westcott sells 60 to 80 million scissors and 15 to 18 million rulers worldwide annually.\nHistory.\n1808\u20131871.\nHenry Westcott was born in &lt;a href=\"Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Newport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; in 1808 where he learned the &lt;a href=\"Sash%20window\"&gt;sash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Window%20blind\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt; makers' trade. Later, he started his own &lt;a href=\"company\"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; together with his brother Edwin and an associate called Hiram Miller to manufacture sash, &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s and blinds. After retiring from this &lt;a href=\"business\"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;, he moved to Seneca Falls in 1847 to embark in the manufacture of an improved &lt;a href=\"Butter%20churn\"&gt;churn&lt;/a&gt; and butter &lt;a href=\"Bucket\"&gt;pail&lt;/a&gt; on which he had secured &lt;a href=\"patent\"&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt;s. Also this business proved to be a success, mainly because Henry Westcott &lt;a href=\"Invention\"&gt;invented&lt;/a&gt; and built &lt;a href=\"machine\"&gt;machine&lt;/a&gt;ry to make the wooden products he sold, while competitors were still making them by hand. In 1868, at the age of 60, he sold his interest in this company.\n1872\u20131893.\nIn 1872 Henry, along with his two &lt;a href=\"son\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt;s Charles and Frank, established the firm Westcott Brothers to manufacture a variety of wood specialties. While Charles concentrated on operating the &lt;a href=\"factory\"&gt;factory&lt;/a&gt; and Frank on selling the products, here too, Henry's &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and inventive &lt;a href=\"genius\"&gt;genius&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for the company's growth. When Henry &lt;a href=\"Retirement\"&gt;retired&lt;/a&gt; in 1890, the company was &lt;a href=\"Company%20renaming\"&gt;renamed&lt;/a&gt; to Westcott Bros. Co. and expanded into numerous products like &lt;a href=\"toy%20block\"&gt;toy block&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"game\"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;s.\n1894\u20131920.\nWhen C. E. and M. R. Jewell joined the business in 1894 it was renamed to Westcott-Jewell Company. At first, the company continued to manufacture a wide variety of products like &lt;a href=\"bicycle\"&gt;bicycle&lt;/a&gt;-holders, stands and hangers, but they quickly started concentrating on rulers, made in all &lt;a href=\"Measurement\"&gt;sizes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wood%20finishing\"&gt;finishes&lt;/a&gt;, both for office use and for advertising purposes. This marked the start of a flourishing period for the company.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Westcott-Jewell Co. &lt;a href=\"Employment\"&gt;employed&lt;/a&gt; about a hundred people and its plant was one of the largest of its kind in the United States with a total floor space of . By that time, their products were shipped to all parts of the United States and &lt;a href=\"export\"&gt;export&lt;/a&gt;ed to many different &lt;a href=\"Country\"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn February 1907, &lt;a href=\"disaster\"&gt;disaster&lt;/a&gt; struck as a big fire destroyed part of the factory. Although the building was equipped with a, for those days, modern &lt;a href=\"Fire%20sprinkler\"&gt;sprinkler system&lt;/a&gt;, damages ran up to $10,000. Luckily, the loss on building and stock was covered by &lt;a href=\"insurance\"&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1920, the company again changed its name from Westcott-Jewell Company to Westcott Rule Company.\n1921\u20131968.\nDuring and after &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; the company continued to produce thousands of rulers and other &lt;a href=\"measuring%20instrument\"&gt;measuring instrument&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter remaining in family hands for 96 years, the Westcott Rule Co. was sold in 1968 to Acme Shear Company of &lt;a href=\"Bridgeport%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Bridgeport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Connecticut\"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, which was a manufacturer of shears and &lt;a href=\"medical%20equipment\"&gt;medical equipment&lt;/a&gt;. The company's 55 employees could hold their &lt;a href=\"Job%20%28role%29\"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; and the products continued to be sold under the Westcott brand.\n1969\u2013Present.\nAcme Shear changed its name to Acme United Corporation in 1971 to better reflect its diversified product mix. When hard times fell upon Acme United during the mid-1990s, the company decided to sell the old Westcott factory and move its production to the lower cost and more efficient facility in &lt;a href=\"North%20Carolina\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut that wasn't the end for Westcott. It had become such a well-known brand that Acme United started using the name on a wide variety of school and office products such as trimmers, pencil sharpeners, erasers, math tools, craft tools, etc.\nThanks to constant innovation, Westcott continues to bring new products to the market. In 2016, for example, a new scissor for kids, coined Ergo Jr, was launched. These are the first and only scissors developed in cooperation with the United States Ergonomics organization.\nMore recently, it launched a set of glue guns for the craft and DIY markets. These guns have non-stick internal mechanisms so that the glue sticks don't clog up the machines. Also, the tips of the guns have non-stick color changing coatings. That way, when the tip of the gun is hot, it turns red and users know not to touch it. When it's red, it's also ready to dispense the glue. And when the tip is cool, it's blue.\nMain Products Today.\nAlthough Westcott manufactures everyday products, the brand tries to stay one step ahead by improving the materials it uses, such as titanium coated blades or blades with a non-stick coating. Other products have Microban antimicrobial protection to prevent the growth of bacteria on the surface.\nScissors.\nWestcott sells a wide assortment of scissors. Starting from regular, everyday scissors to scissors with &lt;a href=\"titanium\"&gt;titanium&lt;/a&gt; coated blades or &lt;a href=\"Non-stick%20surface\"&gt;non-stick&lt;/a&gt; coated blades to use in areas where much &lt;a href=\"Adhesive\"&gt;glue&lt;/a&gt; and paste are used.\niPoint pencil sharpener.\nWestcott is also known for its line of iPoint electric pencil sharpeners. The original iPoint, the iPoint Evolution, and the iPoint Orbit all won a &lt;a href=\"Good%20Design%20Award%20%28Chicago%29\"&gt;Good Design Award&lt;/a&gt; from the Chicago Athenaeum, Museum of Architecture and Design in the office products category. It's one of Acme United's best selling products. In 2013, for example, the sharpener's revenues reached about $11 million.\nRulers.\nWestcott sells rulers in wood, &lt;a href=\"plastic\"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stainless%20steel\"&gt;stainless steel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aluminum\"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt;. Next to regular rulers, the company also manufactures Twist-It flexible rulers that can't be broken and rulers with Microban, an ingredient that inhibits the growth of bacteria.\nOther.\nOther main Westcott products include TrimAir paper trimmers, drafting and measuring tools, erasers, math tools, stencils, and vinyl lettering.\nCompetitors.\nThe major competitor in the cutting category is &lt;a href=\"Fiskars\"&gt;Fiskars Corporation&lt;/a&gt;. The major competitor in the measuring category is &lt;a href=\"Helix%20%28stationery%20company%29\"&gt;Helix International Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;"
