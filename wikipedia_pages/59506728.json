However, the church pulled out of sponsorship after the 2017 season.\nBrief History.\nYadah FC was originally formed as Gunners in 2005 by Cuthbert Chitima. Gunners was later on purchased by Walter Magaya in 2014. Magaya entered into a partnership with the then President Cuthbert Chitima. The team's name was changed to Yadah Gunners. They were relegated from the Premier soccer league to division 1 in 2012, which led to legendary player and coach, &lt;a href=\"Moses%20Chunga\"&gt;Moses Chunga&lt;/a&gt;, deciding to take time off football then returning again to coach &lt;a href=\"Harare%20City%20F.C.\"&gt;Harare City Football Club&lt;/a&gt;. Yadah Stars regained promotion to the Premier League when they triumphed in the ZIFA Eastern Region Division One in their first season in that league in 2016 under the guidance of coach Kuda Masaraure. In 2017, the club appointed Jairos Tapera as the head coach. \nCurrent squad.\nAs of 2018"
