    "text": "Cadwalader Ringgold (August 20, 1802 \u2013 April 29, 1867) was an officer in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; who served in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Exploring%20Expedition\"&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, later headed an expedition to the Northwest and, after initially retiring, returned to service during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife and early career.\nCadwalader Ringgold was born August 20, 1802, in &lt;a href=\"Washington%20County%2C%20Maryland\"&gt;Washington County, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, at Fountain Rock, the family estate.\nHis mother was Maria Cadwalader (1776\u20131811), daughter of &lt;a href=\"John%20Cadwalader%20%28general%29\"&gt;John Cadwalader&lt;/a&gt; (1742\u20131786), who was a general during the &lt;a href=\"American%20Revolutionary%20War\"&gt;American Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt;. Some sources spell his first name with two \"l\"s.\nHis father was &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Ringgold%20%28congressman%29\"&gt;Samuel Ringgold&lt;/a&gt;, a Maryland politician who later served in the U.S. House of Representatives. \nHe had an older brother, &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Ringgold%20%28US%20Army%20officer%29\"&gt;Samuel Ringgold&lt;/a&gt;, an army officer called \"the father of modern artillery\" and who died in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Palo%20Alto\"&gt;Battle of Palo Alto&lt;/a&gt;. Cadwalader was the sixth of 11 children, the youngest child of his mother, who then died. His father remarried and had five more children by his second wife.\nRinggold entered the U.S. Navy in 1819 and commanded the &lt;a href=\"schooner\"&gt;schooner&lt;/a&gt; USS Weazel in action against &lt;a href=\"West%20Indies\"&gt;West Indies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pirates\"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt; during the late 1820s. He became a lieutenant on May 17, 1828, and that year served on in the Pacific Ocean. He served on the in the &lt;a href=\"Mediterranean%20Sea\"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnited States Exploring Expedition.\nDuring 1838\u201342, he was third in command of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Exploring%20Expedition\"&gt;United States Exploring Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in the Pacific, commanding from 1840 at the invitation of the head of the project, &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Wilkes\"&gt;Charles Wilkes&lt;/a&gt;. He carried out surveys of &lt;a href=\"Antarctica\"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, the South American coast, the &lt;a href=\"Tuamotu%20Islands\"&gt;Tuamotu Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tonga\"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and the Northwest Pacific coast of North America.\nWhen the expedition visited &lt;a href=\"Fiji\"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, they captured &lt;a href=\"Vendoni\"&gt;Vendoni&lt;/a&gt;, a chief on the islands who had inspired some Fijians to capture and eat 11 crewmen on a ship seven years before. Soon afterward, Fijians on the island of &lt;a href=\"Malolo\"&gt;Malolo&lt;/a&gt; ambushed and killed two popular officers of the expedition, and the Americans took revenge. Wilkes' ship grounded on the north side of the island, but Ringgold led 80 men from the south side. Women and children were spared, but about 87 Fijians were killed before the rest surrendered. Two villages were destroyed.\nThe expedition visited California that summer. On August 19, 1841, Ringgold led a 60-man party exploring &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Bay\"&gt;San Francisco Bay&lt;/a&gt; watershed for 20 days. The party got about as far as &lt;a href=\"Colusa%2C%20California\"&gt;Colusa, California&lt;/a&gt;. Ringgold, who returned to New York shortly after the rest of the expedition, had been gone three years and 11 months at sea. He and his crew had sailed and lost only two men.\nOther expeditions.\nRinggold was promoted to commander on July 16, 1849, and began the definitive survey of the San Francisco Bay region, suddenly important because of the &lt;a href=\"California%20Gold%20Rush\"&gt;discovery of gold&lt;/a&gt; in the area. The survey began in August 1849, with Ringgold commanding the chartered brig \"Col. Fremont\".\nAfter the California surveys, Ringgold helped Navy officials choose a location for a dockyard for the Navy's Pacific station. It later became the &lt;a href=\"Mare%20Island%20Navy%20Yard\"&gt;Mare Island Navy Yard&lt;/a&gt;. He published \"A Series of Charts with Sailing Directions\" in 1851.Together with Commodore &lt;a href=\"Matthew%20C.%20Perry\"&gt;Matthew Perry&lt;/a&gt; and others, Ringgold served in August 1852 on the Board of Examination for midshipmen of the &lt;a href=\"U.S.%20Naval%20Academy\"&gt;U.S. Naval Academy&lt;/a&gt; at Annapolis.\nIt may have been around this time that Ringgold acquired a &lt;a href=\"bust%20%28sculpture%29\"&gt;bust&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Whig&lt;/a&gt; politician &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Clay\"&gt;Henry Clay&lt;/a&gt;, presumably out of admiration.\nIn 1853 he took command of the five ships in the &lt;a href=\"North%20Pacific%20Exploring%20and%20Surveying%20Expedition\"&gt;North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the \"Rodgers-Ringgold Expedition\", with the as his flagship, but while on the expedition, in July 1854, he contracted &lt;a href=\"malaria\"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; and was sent home, according to at least one source. \n&lt;a href=\"Nathaniel%20Philbrick\"&gt;Nathaniel Philbrick&lt;/a&gt;, in his book \"Sea of Glory\" about the U.S. Exploring Expedition, writes that in the later expedition Ringgold \"began to act strangely\" once in China, keeping his ships in port and \"ceaselessly repairing his vessels\". Commodore Perry, on his own expedition, sailed in and convened an official panel which relieved Ringgold from command of the expedition and sent him home. Philbrick quotes Perry as declaring Ringgold \"insane.\" &lt;a href=\"John%20Rodgers%20%28naval%20officer%2C%20Civil%20War%29\"&gt;John Rodgers&lt;/a&gt; was given full command of the expedition and completed it.\nA board of naval doctors convened by Perry declared Ringgold unfit for active service, and he was put on the reserve list on September 13, 1855. Ringgold recovered within weeks, and soon petitioned Congress for his return. Unsuccessful there, he appealed to a Court of Inquiry, and eventually succeeded in returning to the active list on January 23, 1858, (retroactive to April 2, 1856), a campaign of more than two years.\nFor the next several years, he was in Washington, D.C., working on the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition charts, some of which were used by the US Navy in WWII (charts from the United States Exploring Expedition were also used in that war).\nCivil War and after.\nRinggold returned to the fleet with the rank of captain during the Civil War. While in command of the frigate on November 1, 1861, he effected the rescue of a battalion of 400 &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Marine%20Corps\"&gt;Marines&lt;/a&gt; from Maryland whose transport steamer, \"Governor\", was sinking during a severe storm near &lt;a href=\"Port%20Royal%2C%20South%20Carolina\"&gt;Port Royal, South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn February 1862, he was a part of the search and rescue of the ship of the line which had lost her rudder in a storm. For these rescues, Ringgold received commendations from the Maryland Legislature and the U.S. Congress, along with a gold medal from the Life Saving Benevolent Association.\nPromoted to &lt;a href=\"Commodore%20%28rank%29\"&gt;commodore&lt;/a&gt; on July 16, 1862, he was sent (still on the \"Sabine\"), to cruise the &lt;a href=\"Azores\"&gt;Azores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Verde%20Islands\"&gt;Cape Verde Islands&lt;/a&gt;, the coast of &lt;a href=\"Brazil\"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and then back to New York in a fruitless search for the Confederate raider from November 1862 to February 1863. In mid-1863, Ringgold's assignment was to search (again unsuccessfully) in the vicinity of Bermuda and then the New England coast for the bark , another Confederate raider.\nFor reasons of age, he was retired on August 20, 1864, and placed on the &lt;a href=\"Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;rear admiral&lt;/a&gt; (retired) list in 1866 (a promotion that was given to all commanders of squadrons). In retirement, he lived at 18 East Eighteenth Street (at Union Square) in New York City. Ringgold, who had never married, died of &lt;a href=\"apoplexy\"&gt;apoplexy&lt;/a&gt; (stroke) in New York on April 29, 1867.\nDays later, as the Marine band played the \"Dead March\" from \"&lt;a href=\"Saul%20%28Handel%29\"&gt;Saul&lt;/a&gt;\", 400 Marines and carriages in the funeral cortege proceeded from Ringgold's residence down Broadway to &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Church%20%28New%20York%20City%29\"&gt;Trinity Church&lt;/a&gt;. In attendance were Admirals &lt;a href=\"David%20Farragut\"&gt;Farragut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Henry%20H.%20Bell\"&gt;Bell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Stringham\"&gt;Stringham&lt;/a&gt;, along with a number of generals. Ringgold's remains were taken by train to &lt;a href=\"Green%20Mount%20Cemetery\"&gt;Green Mount Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in Baltimore, where he lies next to the grave of his brother, Major &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Ringgold%20%28soldier%29\"&gt;Samuel Ringgold&lt;/a&gt;.\nNamesakes.\nTwo ships have been named in his honor: and .\nRinggold Street in San Francisco, California is named after him. However, the street in question is spelled as 'Ringold'.\nAnother namesake was the writer &lt;a href=\"Ring%20Lardner\"&gt;Ring Lardner&lt;/a&gt;. Rear Admiral &lt;a href=\"James%20Lawrence%20Lardner\"&gt;James Lawrence Lardner&lt;/a&gt; was a friend of Ringgold's. He named a son \"Ringgold Wilmer Lardner\", and James' brother gave exactly the same name to his son after the newborn's cousin. Ring Lardner disliked his name and shortened it but \"lost the battle\" when his son, &lt;a href=\"Ring%20Lardner%20Jr.\"&gt;Ring Lardner Jr.&lt;/a&gt; was named after him."
