    "text": "Basil Hassan is an external operations plotter for &lt;a href=\"Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant\"&gt;Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant&lt;/a&gt; (ISIL). In 2013, Hassan was accused of shooting &lt;a href=\"Lars%20Hedegaard\"&gt;Lars Hedegaard&lt;/a&gt;, a 70-year old Danish author and journalist. After being arrested in &lt;a href=\"Turkey\"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, he was released as part of an alleged exchange for 49 hostages held by the ISIL. After his release, Hassan was believed to have travelled to &lt;a href=\"Syria\"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; to join ISIL. In November 2016, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20State\"&gt;US State Department&lt;/a&gt; issued a note, designating three persons as terror-operatives. He was later revealed as the mastermind of a failed attempt to blow up a long distance plane, in what has now been cited as the most ingenious ISIS terror project."
