    "text": "Gentlemen, I Neglected to Inform You You Will Not Be Getting Paid is a 2009 album by &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; guitarist &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Hunter\"&gt;Charlie Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecorded \"In Glorious Mono\" on analog tape with no overdubs, the album marks a shift in Hunter's sound from the genre-mixing of his previous three releases to a consistent blues/R&amp;B-influenced approach. The title is allegedly a real quotation; according to Hunter,\nWell, it's a quote from a real, older, curmudgeonly musician that people have worked for. And I cannot name names, but it really did happen. It really does happen; let me put it that way.\nTrack listing.\nAll songs written by &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Hunter\"&gt;Charlie Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonnel.\nProduction"
