    "text": "Dirk Heyne (born 10 October 1957 in &lt;a href=\"Magdeburg\"&gt;Magdeburg&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany\"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt;) is a former German &lt;a href=\"Association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; goalkeeper turned &lt;a href=\"Coach%20%28sport%29\"&gt;manager&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareer.\nHeyne began his footballing career at &lt;a href=\"1.%20FC%20Magdeburg\"&gt;1. FC Magdeburg&lt;/a&gt;'s youth teams in 1967. In 1977, he had his debut in the &lt;a href=\"DDR-Oberliga\"&gt;DDR-Oberliga&lt;/a&gt; team and went on to tend goal in 323 Oberliga matches for 1. FC Magdeburg. His international career lasted for more than 11 years but only in the 1989/90 season Heyne was &lt;a href=\"East%20Germany%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;East Germany's&lt;/a&gt; first choice goalkeeper. In 1991, after &lt;a href=\"German%20reunification\"&gt;German reunification&lt;/a&gt; and Magdeburg's relegation to the tier III &lt;a href=\"NOFV-Oberliga%20Mitte\"&gt;NOFV-Oberliga Mitte&lt;/a&gt;, Heyne moved to &lt;a href=\"Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach\"&gt;Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach&lt;/a&gt;, playing in 24 &lt;a href=\"Bundesliga\"&gt;Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; matches until 1994, when he retired from playing. \nUntil 2001 he stayed at M\u00f6nchengladbach, holding several positions including the post of goalkeeper coach. In 2001, he returned to 1. FC Magdeburg, coaching the U19 youth team. In 2003, he took over managing the senior team in the tier IV &lt;a href=\"NOFV-Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd\"&gt;NOFV-Oberliga S\u00fcd&lt;/a&gt;, leading them to a league title in 2006 and thus winning promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Regionalliga%20Nord\"&gt;Regionalliga Nord&lt;/a&gt;. After a successful first year in the new league, when the team finished third, missing out on promotion to &lt;a href=\"2.%20Bundesliga\"&gt;2. Bundesliga&lt;/a&gt; by a mere point, crisis followed. With the team lagging six points behind a non-relegation spot in the &lt;a href=\"2007%E2%80%9308%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Regionalliga\"&gt;2007\u201308 season&lt;/a&gt;, Dirk Heyne was sacked by the club.\nOn 4 July 2008, &lt;a href=\"FC%20Sachsen%20Leipzig\"&gt;FC Sachsen Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; announced they had signed Dirk Heyne as manager for their &lt;a href=\"Regionalliga%20Nord\"&gt;Regionalliga Nord&lt;/a&gt; campaign.\nAside from his manager career, Heyne owns a goalkeeping academy near Magdeburg."
