    "text": "\"The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\", one of the 56 short &lt;a href=\"Sherlock%20Holmes\"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt; stories written by Sir &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle\"&gt;Arthur Conan Doyle&lt;/a&gt;, is the eleventh of the twelve stories collected in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adventures%20of%20Sherlock%20Holmes\"&gt;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&lt;/a&gt;\". The story was first published in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Strand%20Magazine\"&gt;The Strand Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" in May 1892.\nPlot.\nA banker, Mr. Alexander Holder of &lt;a href=\"Streatham\"&gt;Streatham&lt;/a&gt;, makes a loan of \u00a350,000 (equivalent to approximately \u00a3 in ) to a socially prominent client, who leaves a &lt;a href=\"beryl\"&gt;beryl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"coronet\"&gt;coronet&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one of the most valuable public possessions in existence\u2014as collateral. Holder feels that he must not leave this rare and precious piece of &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; in his personal safe at the bank, and so he takes it home with him to lock it up there. He is awakened in the night by a noise, enters his dressing room, and is horrified to see his son Arthur with the &lt;a href=\"coronet\"&gt;coronet&lt;/a&gt; in his hands, apparently trying to bend it. Holder's niece Mary comes at the sound of all the shouting and, seeing the damaged coronet, faints dead away. Three &lt;a href=\"beryl\"&gt;beryl&lt;/a&gt;s are missing from it. In a panic, Mr. Holder travels to see Holmes, who agrees to take the case.\nThe case against Arthur seems rather damning, yet Holmes is not convinced of his guilt. Why is Arthur refusing to give a statement of any kind? How could Arthur have broken the coronet (even Holmes, who has exceptionally strong hands, can barely do it) and without making any noise? Could any other people in the household be involved, such as the servants, or Mary? Could some visitor, such as the maid's wooden-legged suitor, or Arthur's rakish friend Sir George Burnwell, have something to do with what happened to the coronet? The failure to resolve the case will result in Mr Holder's dishonour, and a national scandal.\nHolmes sets about not only reviewing the details that he learns from Holder but also by examining the &lt;a href=\"footprints\"&gt;footprints&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; outside. Eventually, Holmes solves the mystery, and Holder is flabbergasted to find that his niece was in league with a notorious criminal (Sir George Burnwell), although apparently, she is unaware of his character. The two of them escape justice; however, Holmes is convinced that they will receive their punishment in due time. Arthur's motive in allowing his father to think he was the thief was that he was in love with his cousin Mary and saw her passing the coronet to Burnwell outside the window. (The coronet was broken when Arthur was struggling to wrench it from Burnwell's grasp.) Holmes regains the jewels after threatening Sir George at gunpoint with an offer of \u00a31,000 apiece (for each of the 3 beryls); Burnwell is shocked at Holmes' offer\u2014he had already sold them to a &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; for \u00a3300. With the additional offer of no prosecution, Holmes buys the beryls from the fence for \u00a33,000; Holmes receives \u00a34,000 compensation but sternly scolds Holder that he owes his son an apology for erroneously assuming Arthur had stolen the coronet.\nPublication history.\n\"The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\" was first published in the UK in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Strand%20Magazine\"&gt;The Strand Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" in May 1892, and in the United States in the US edition of the \"Strand\" in June 1892.
