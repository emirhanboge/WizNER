    "text": "Trinity Church (\"Dreifaltigkeitskirche\") was a &lt;a href=\"Baroque%20architecture\"&gt;Baroque&lt;/a&gt; Protestant church in Berlin, eastern Germany, dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Trinity\"&gt;Holy Trinity&lt;/a&gt;. It was opened in August 1739 and destroyed in November 1943, with its rubble removed in 1947.\n It was located in the &lt;a href=\"Friedrichstadt%20%28Berlin%29\"&gt;Friedrichstadt&lt;/a&gt; district (now part of the &lt;a href=\"Mitte\"&gt;Mitte&lt;/a&gt; borough), at the intersection of Mauerstra\u00dfe, Kanonierstra\u00dfe (now known as Glinkastra\u00dfe) and &lt;a href=\"Mohrenstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Mohrenstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt; at the postcode 10117 Berlin. Three domestic houses used as a vicarages were built on Glinkastra\u00dfe/Taubenstra\u00dfe and the two which survived World War II are still part of the parish today (Glinkastra\u00dfe 16 and Taubenstra\u00dfe 3.). A similar church, the 1737 B\u00f6hmische Bethlehems-Kirche was also nearby (Bethlehemskirchplatz).\nHistory.\nThe expansion of Berlin by &lt;a href=\"Frederick%20William%20I%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Frederick William I of Prussia&lt;/a&gt; led to a need for new church buildings. The first stone for Trinity Church was laid in August 1737 and Titus Favre made head of works. It was designed by &lt;a href=\"Christian%20August%20Naumann\"&gt;Christian August Naumann&lt;/a&gt; as a circular building with four short projections, suggesting a cross shape.\n It also had a 22m diameter dome over the centre of the cross, consisting of a tiled wooden structure with an octagonal lantern that served as bell tower and internal decoration representing the Four Evangelists. The nave was initially surrounded by three galleries, with the pulpit altar, organ and a second altar on the east side. The church was inaugurated on 30 August 1739 and for around a hundred years after that was the newest Protestant church building in Berlin. Its first pastor, the teacher and theologian &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Julius%20Hecker\"&gt;Julius Hecker&lt;/a&gt;, was appointed by Frederick William himself.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20I\"&gt;Napoleon I&lt;/a&gt;'s occupation of Berlin the church was temporarily used as a barracks, whilst the theologian &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Schleiermacher\"&gt;Friedrich Schleiermacher&lt;/a&gt; preached there from 1809 to 1834 and also &lt;a href=\"confirmation\"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the future chancellor &lt;a href=\"Otto%20von%20Bismarck\"&gt;Otto von Bismarck&lt;/a&gt; in the church in 1831.\n Schleiermacher, who had made the case for a &lt;a href=\"united%20and%20uniting%20churches\"&gt;union&lt;/a&gt; of the Lutheran and Calvinist congregations in &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;, persuaded the congregation not only to join the united umbrella &lt;a href=\"Evangelical%20Church%20in%20Prussia\"&gt;Evangelical Church in Prussia&lt;/a&gt; (est. in 1817) but to also adopt the union confession for the congregation itself, which was not required but introduced by a handful of congregations in Berlin.\n The upper gallery was rebuilt by the architect &lt;a href=\"Adolf%20Lohse\"&gt;Adolf Lohse&lt;/a&gt; in 1864. Ernst Hermann von Dryander (1843\u20131922) was the church's pastor from 1882 to 1898, during which time a baptistery and a new vestry porch were added to plans by the architects Carl Vohl and &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Schulze\"&gt;Friedrich Schulze&lt;/a&gt; between 1885 and 1886.\n&lt;a href=\"Paul%20von%20Hindenburg\"&gt;Paul von Hindenburg&lt;/a&gt; went to Sunday service at the church, whilst &lt;a href=\"Dietrich%20Bonhoeffer\"&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer&lt;/a&gt; preached at university services there during his time as lecturer and chaplain at the &lt;a href=\"Berlin%20Institute%20of%20Technology\"&gt;TU Berlin&lt;/a&gt; from 1932 to 1933. It was &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Berlin%20%28air%29\"&gt;destroyed by bombing in November 1943&lt;/a&gt; and its ruins were then used as a &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Party\"&gt;Nazi Party&lt;/a&gt; bunker before being demolished in 1947. The parish continued holding services after the war until at least the 1970s in the rectory on &lt;a href=\"Wilhelmstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Wilhelmstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt; 115.\nCemeteries.\n The congregation comprised many known Berliners as parishioners since its parish included quarters of central Berlin fancy to live in among the better off in the 19th century. The cemeteries still preserve many graves of known parishioners. The cemeteries are each called Dreifaltigkeitsfriedhof and are numbered: "
