    "text": "The exponential function is a mathematical &lt;a href=\"Function%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt; denoted by formula_1 or formula_2 (where the argument is written as an &lt;a href=\"exponentiation\"&gt;exponent&lt;/a&gt;). It can be defined in &lt;a href=\"Characterizations%20of%20the%20exponential%20function\"&gt;several equivalent ways&lt;/a&gt;. Its ubiquitous occurrence in &lt;a href=\"Pure%20mathematics\"&gt;pure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"applied%20mathematics\"&gt;applied mathematics&lt;/a&gt; led mathematician &lt;a href=\"Walter%20Rudin\"&gt;Walter Rudin&lt;/a&gt; to opine that the exponential function is \"the most important function in mathematics\". Its value at 1, formula_3 is a &lt;a href=\"mathematical%20constant\"&gt;mathematical constant&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"e%20%28mathematical%20constant%29\"&gt;Euler's number&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe exponential function equals its own &lt;a href=\"derivative\"&gt;derivative&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, it appears in the solutions of many &lt;a href=\"differential%20equations\"&gt;differential equations&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoreover, it satisfies the &lt;a href=\"identity%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt; \nwhich, along with the definition formula_5, shows that formula_6 for positive integers , relating the exponential function to the elementary notion of &lt;a href=\"exponentiation\"&gt;exponentiation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe argument of the exponential function can be any &lt;a href=\"Real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"complex%20number\"&gt;complex number&lt;/a&gt;. This allows one to extend the concept of &lt;a href=\"exponentiation\"&gt;exponentiation&lt;/a&gt; (which would normally be defined only for integer exponents as: formula_7 for integer ) to &lt;a href=\"Real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Complex%20number\"&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"exponents\"&gt;exponents&lt;/a&gt;, by defining formula_8 for positive and real or complex . The exponential of a &lt;a href=\"complex%20number\"&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; argument is closely related to &lt;a href=\"trigonometry\"&gt;trigonometry&lt;/a&gt; as shown by &lt;a href=\"Euler%27s%20formula\"&gt;Euler's formula&lt;/a&gt;. The argument can even be an entirely different kind of &lt;a href=\"mathematical%20object\"&gt;mathematical object&lt;/a&gt; (for example, a &lt;a href=\"square%20matrix\"&gt;square matrix&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn applied settings, exponential functions model a relationship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same proportional change (that is, percentage increase or decrease) in the dependent variable. This occurs widely in the natural and social sciences, as in a self-reproducing &lt;a href=\"Population%20dynamics\"&gt;population&lt;/a&gt;, a fund accruing compound &lt;a href=\"interest\"&gt;interest&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Moore%27s%20law\"&gt;growing body of manufacturing expertise&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the exponential function also appears in a variety of contexts within &lt;a href=\"physics\"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"computer%20science\"&gt;computer science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chemistry\"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mathematical%20biology\"&gt;mathematical biology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"economics\"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe real exponential function is a &lt;a href=\"bijection\"&gt;bijection&lt;/a&gt; from formula_9 to formula_10. Its &lt;a href=\"inverse%20function\"&gt;inverse function&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"natural%20logarithm\"&gt;natural logarithm&lt;/a&gt;, denoted formula_11 formula_12 or formula_13 because of this, some old texts refer to the exponential function as the antilogarithm.\n\"The\" exponential function is sometimes called the natural exponential function for distinguishing it from the other \"exponential functions\", which are the functions of the form formula_14 where the base is a positive &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real number&lt;/a&gt;. The definition formula_15 for positive and &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"complex%20number\"&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt; establishes a strong relationship between these functions, which explains this ambiguous terminology.\nGraph.\nThe &lt;a href=\"graph%20of%20a%20function\"&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt; of formula_16 is upward-sloping, and increases faster as increases. The graph always lies above the -axis, but becomes arbitrarily close to it for large negative ; thus, the -axis is a horizontal &lt;a href=\"asymptote\"&gt;asymptote&lt;/a&gt;. The equation formula_17 means that the &lt;a href=\"slope\"&gt;slope&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"tangent\"&gt;tangent&lt;/a&gt; to the graph at each point is equal to its -coordinate at that point.\nRelation to more general exponential functions.\nThe exponential function formula_18 is sometimes called the \"natural exponential function\" for distinguishing it from the other exponential functions. The study of any exponential function can easily be reduced to that of the natural exponential function, since per definition, for positive ,\nAs functions of a real variable, exponential functions are uniquely &lt;a href=\"characterization%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;characterized&lt;/a&gt; by the fact that the &lt;a href=\"derivative\"&gt;derivative&lt;/a&gt; of such a function is &lt;a href=\"Proportionality%20%28mathematics%29%23Direct%20proportionality\"&gt;directly proportional&lt;/a&gt; to the value of the function. The constant of proportionality of this relationship is the &lt;a href=\"natural%20logarithm\"&gt;natural logarithm&lt;/a&gt; of the base :\nFor , the function formula_21 is increasing (as depicted for and ), because formula_22 makes the derivative always positive; while for , the function is decreasing (as depicted for ); and for the function is constant.\n&lt;a href=\"Euler%27s%20number\"&gt;Euler's number&lt;/a&gt; is the unique base for which the constant of proportionality is 1, since formula_23, so that the function is its own derivative:\nThis function, also denoted as , is called the \"natural exponential function\", or simply \"the exponential function\". Since any exponential function can be written in terms of the natural exponential as formula_25, it is computationally and conceptually convenient to reduce the study of exponential functions to this particular one. The natural exponential is hence denoted by\nThe former notation is commonly used for simpler exponents, while the latter is preferred when the exponent is a complicated expression.\nFor real numbers and , a function of the form formula_28 is also an exponential function, since it can be rewritten as \nFormal definition.\nThe real exponential function formula_30 can be characterized in a variety of equivalent ways. It is commonly defined by the following &lt;a href=\"power%20series\"&gt;power series&lt;/a&gt;:\nSince the &lt;a href=\"radius%20of%20convergence\"&gt;radius of convergence&lt;/a&gt; of this power series is infinite, this definition is, in fact, applicable to all complex numbers formula_32 (see for the extension of formula_33 to the complex plane). The constant can then be defined as formula_34\nThe term-by-term differentiation of this power series reveals that formula_35 for all real , leading to another common characterization of formula_33 as the unique solution of the &lt;a href=\"differential%20equation\"&gt;differential equation&lt;/a&gt;\nsatisfying the initial condition formula_38\nBased on this characterization, the &lt;a href=\"chain%20rule\"&gt;chain rule&lt;/a&gt; shows that its inverse function, the &lt;a href=\"natural%20logarithm\"&gt;natural logarithm&lt;/a&gt;, satisfies formula_39 for formula_40 or formula_41 This relationship leads to a less common definition of the real exponential function formula_33 as the solution formula_43 to the equation\nBy way of the &lt;a href=\"binomial%20theorem\"&gt;binomial theorem&lt;/a&gt; and the power series definition, the exponential function can also be defined as the following limit:\nIt can be shown that every &lt;a href=\"continuous%20function\"&gt;continuous&lt;/a&gt;, nonzero solution of the functional equation formula_46 is an exponential function, formula_47 with formula_48\nOverview.\nThe exponential function arises whenever a quantity &lt;a href=\"exponential%20growth\"&gt;grows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"exponential%20decay\"&gt;decays&lt;/a&gt; at a rate &lt;a href=\"Proportionality%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;proportional&lt;/a&gt; to its current value. One such situation is &lt;a href=\"continuously%20compounded%20interest\"&gt;continuously compounded interest&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact it was this observation that led &lt;a href=\"Jacob%20Bernoulli\"&gt;Jacob Bernoulli&lt;/a&gt; in 1683 to the number\nnow known as . Later, in 1697, &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Bernoulli\"&gt;Johann Bernoulli&lt;/a&gt; studied the calculus of the exponential function.\nIf a principal amount of 1 earns interest at an annual rate of compounded monthly, then the interest earned each month is times the current value, so each month the total value is multiplied by , and the value at the end of the year is . If instead interest is compounded daily, this becomes . Letting the number of time intervals per year grow without bound leads to the &lt;a href=\"limit%20of%20a%20function\"&gt;limit&lt;/a&gt; definition of the exponential function,\nfirst given by &lt;a href=\"Leonhard%20Euler\"&gt;Leonhard Euler&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is one of a number of &lt;a href=\"characterizations%20of%20the%20exponential%20function\"&gt;characterizations of the exponential function&lt;/a&gt;; others involve &lt;a href=\"series%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"differential%20equation\"&gt;differential equation&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFrom any of these definitions it can be shown that the exponential function obeys the basic &lt;a href=\"exponentiation\"&gt;exponentiation&lt;/a&gt; identity,\nwhich justifies the notation for .\nThe &lt;a href=\"derivative\"&gt;derivative&lt;/a&gt; (rate of change) of the exponential function is the exponential function itself. More generally, a function with a rate of change \"proportional\" to the function itself (rather than equal to it) is expressible in terms of the exponential function. This function property leads to &lt;a href=\"exponential%20growth\"&gt;exponential growth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"exponential%20decay\"&gt;exponential decay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe exponential function extends to an &lt;a href=\"entire%20function\"&gt;entire function&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"complex%20plane\"&gt;complex plane&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Euler%27s%20formula\"&gt;Euler's formula&lt;/a&gt; relates its values at purely imaginary arguments to &lt;a href=\"trigonometric%20functions\"&gt;trigonometric functions&lt;/a&gt;. The exponential function also has analogues for which the argument is a &lt;a href=\"matrix%20exponential\"&gt;matrix&lt;/a&gt;, or even an element of a &lt;a href=\"Banach%20algebra\"&gt;Banach algebra&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Lie%20algebra\"&gt;Lie algebra&lt;/a&gt;.\nDerivatives and differential equations.\nThe importance of the exponential function in mathematics and the sciences stems mainly from its property as the unique function which is equal to its derivative and is equal to 1 when . That is,\nFunctions of the form for constant are the only functions that are equal to their derivative (by the &lt;a href=\"Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f%20theorem\"&gt;Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem&lt;/a&gt;). Other ways of saying the same thing include:\nIf a variable's growth or decay rate is &lt;a href=\"proportionality%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;proportional&lt;/a&gt; to its size\u2014as is the case in unlimited population growth (see &lt;a href=\"Malthusian%20catastrophe\"&gt;Malthusian catastrophe&lt;/a&gt;), continuously compounded &lt;a href=\"interest\"&gt;interest&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"radioactive%20decay\"&gt;radioactive decay&lt;/a&gt;\u2014then the variable can be written as a constant times an exponential function of time. Explicitly for any real constant , a function satisfies if and only if for some constant . The constant \"k\" is called the decay constant, disintegration constant, rate constant, or transformation constant.\nFurthermore, for any differentiable function , we find, by the &lt;a href=\"chain%20rule\"&gt;chain rule&lt;/a&gt;:\nContinued fractions for.\nA &lt;a href=\"continued%20fraction\"&gt;continued fraction&lt;/a&gt; for can be obtained via &lt;a href=\"Euler%27s%20continued%20fraction%20formula\"&gt;an identity of Euler&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe following &lt;a href=\"generalized%20continued%20fraction\"&gt;generalized continued fraction&lt;/a&gt; for converges more quickly:\nor, by applying the substitution :\nwith a special case for :\nThis formula also converges, though more slowly, for . For example:\nComplex plane.\nAs in the &lt;a href=\"real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; case, the exponential function can be defined on the &lt;a href=\"complex%20plane\"&gt;complex plane&lt;/a&gt; in several equivalent forms. The most common definition of the complex exponential function parallels the power series definition for real arguments, where the real variable is replaced by a complex one:\nAlternatively, the complex exponential function may defined by modelling the limit definition for real arguments, but with the real variable replaced by a complex one:\nFor the power series definition, term-wise multiplication of two copies of this power series in the &lt;a href=\"Cauchy%20product\"&gt;Cauchy&lt;/a&gt; sense, permitted by &lt;a href=\"Cauchy%20product\"&gt;Mertens' theorem&lt;/a&gt;, shows that the defining multiplicative property of exponential functions continues to hold for all complex arguments:\nThe definition of the complex exponential function in turn leads to the appropriate definitions extending the &lt;a href=\"trigonometric%20functions\"&gt;trigonometric functions&lt;/a&gt; to complex arguments.\nIn particular, when ( real), the series definition yields the expansion\nIn this expansion, the rearrangement of the terms into real and imaginary parts is justified by the absolute convergence of the series. The real and imaginary parts of the above expression in fact correspond to the series expansions of and , respectively.\nThis correspondence provides motivation for cosine and sine for all complex arguments in terms of formula_63 and the equivalent power series:\nThe functions , , and so defined have infinite &lt;a href=\"Radius%20of%20convergence\"&gt;radii of convergence&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"ratio%20test\"&gt;ratio test&lt;/a&gt; and are therefore &lt;a href=\"entire%20function\"&gt;entire function&lt;/a&gt;s (that is, &lt;a href=\"Holomorphic%20function\"&gt;holomorphic&lt;/a&gt; on formula_65). The range of the exponential function is formula_66, while the ranges of the complex sine and cosine functions are both formula_65 in its entirety, in accord with &lt;a href=\"Picard%20theorem\"&gt;Picard's theorem&lt;/a&gt;, which asserts that the range of a nonconstant entire function is either all of formula_65, or formula_65 excluding one &lt;a href=\"lacunary%20value\"&gt;lacunary value&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese definitions for the exponential and trigonometric functions lead trivially to &lt;a href=\"Euler%27s%20formula\"&gt;Euler's formula&lt;/a&gt;:\nWe could alternatively define the complex exponential function based on this relationship. If , where and are both real, then we could define its exponential as\nwhere , , and on the right-hand side of the definition sign are to be interpreted as functions of a real variable, previously defined by other means.\nFor formula_72, the relationship formula_73 holds, so that formula_74 for real formula_75 and formula_76 maps the real line (mod ) to the &lt;a href=\"unit%20circle\"&gt;unit circle&lt;/a&gt; in the complex plane. Moreover, going from formula_77 to formula_78, the curve defined by formula_79 traces a segment of the unit circle of length\nstarting from in the complex plane and going counterclockwise. Based on these observations and the fact that the measure of an angle in radians is the arc length on the unit circle subtended by the angle, it is easy to see that, restricted to real arguments, the sine and cosine functions as defined above coincide with the sine and cosine functions as introduced in elementary mathematics via geometric notions.\nThe complex exponential function is periodic with period and formula_81 holds for all formula_82.\nWhen its domain is extended from the real line to the complex plane, the exponential function retains the following properties:\nExtending the natural logarithm to complex arguments yields the &lt;a href=\"complex%20logarithm\"&gt;complex logarithm&lt;/a&gt; , which is a &lt;a href=\"multivalued%20function\"&gt;multivalued function&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe can then define a more general exponentiation:\nfor all complex numbers and . This is also a multivalued function, even when is real. This distinction is problematic, as the multivalued functions and are easily confused with their single-valued equivalents when substituting a real number for . The rule about multiplying exponents for the case of positive real numbers must be modified in a multivalued context:\nSee &lt;a href=\"Exponentiation%23Failure%20of%20power%20and%20logarithm%20identities\"&gt;failure of power and logarithm identities&lt;/a&gt; for more about problems with combining powers.\nThe exponential function maps any &lt;a href=\"line%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;line&lt;/a&gt; in the complex plane to a &lt;a href=\"logarithmic%20spiral\"&gt;logarithmic spiral&lt;/a&gt; in the complex plane with the center at the &lt;a href=\"Origin%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;origin&lt;/a&gt;. Two special cases exist: when the original line is parallel to the real axis, the resulting spiral never closes in on itself; when the original line is parallel to the imaginary axis, the resulting spiral is a circle of some radius.\nConsidering the complex exponential function as a function involving four real variables:\nthe graph of the exponential function is a two-dimensional surface curving through four dimensions.\nStarting with a color-coded portion of the formula_86 domain, the following are depictions of the graph as variously projected into two or three dimensions.\nThe second image shows how the domain complex plane is mapped into the range complex plane:\nThe third and fourth images show how the graph in the second image extends into one of the other two dimensions not shown in the second image.\nThe third image shows the graph extended along the real formula_87 axis. It shows the graph is a surface of revolution about the formula_87 axis of the graph of the real exponential function, producing a horn or funnel shape.\nThe fourth image shows the graph extended along the imaginary formula_43 axis. It shows that the graph's surface for positive and negative formula_43 values doesn't really meet along the negative real formula_88 axis, but instead forms a spiral surface about the formula_43 axis. Because its formula_43 values have been extended to , this image also better depicts the 2\u03c0 periodicity in the imaginary formula_43 value.\nComputation of where both and are complex.\nComplex exponentiation can be defined by converting to polar coordinates and using the identity :\nHowever, when is not an integer, this function is &lt;a href=\"multivalued%20function\"&gt;multivalued&lt;/a&gt;, because is not unique (see &lt;a href=\"exponentiation%23Failure%20of%20power%20and%20logarithm%20identities\"&gt;failure of power and logarithm identities&lt;/a&gt;).\nMatrices and Banach algebras.\nThe power series definition of the exponential function makes sense for square &lt;a href=\"matrix%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;matrices&lt;/a&gt; (for which the function is called the &lt;a href=\"matrix%20exponential\"&gt;matrix exponential&lt;/a&gt;) and more generally in any unital &lt;a href=\"Banach%20algebra\"&gt;Banach algebra&lt;/a&gt; . In this setting, , and is invertible with inverse for any in . If , then , but this identity can fail for noncommuting and .\nSome alternative definitions lead to the same function. For instance, can be defined as\nOr can be defined as , where is the solution to the differential equation , with initial condition ; it follows that for every in \nLie algebras.\nGiven a &lt;a href=\"Lie%20group\"&gt;Lie group&lt;/a&gt; and its associated &lt;a href=\"Lie%20algebra\"&gt;Lie algebra&lt;/a&gt; formula_100, the &lt;a href=\"exponential%20map%20%28Lie%20theory%29\"&gt;exponential map&lt;/a&gt; is a map formula_100 satisfying similar properties. In fact, since is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of all positive real numbers under multiplication, the ordinary exponential function for real arguments is a special case of the Lie algebra situation. Similarly, since the Lie group of invertible matrices has as Lie algebra , the space of all matrices, the exponential function for square matrices is a special case of the Lie algebra exponential map.\nThe identity can fail for Lie algebra elements and that do not commute; the &lt;a href=\"Baker%E2%80%93Campbell%E2%80%93Hausdorff%20formula\"&gt;Baker\u2013Campbell\u2013Hausdorff formula&lt;/a&gt; supplies the necessary correction terms.\nTranscendency.\nThe function is not in (that is, is not the quotient of two polynomials with complex coefficients).\nFor distinct complex numbers }, the set } is linearly independent over .\nThe function is &lt;a href=\"transcendental%20function\"&gt;transcendental&lt;/a&gt; over .\nComputation.\nWhen computing (an approximation of) the exponential function near the argument , the result will be close to 1, and computing the value of the difference formula_102 with &lt;a href=\"floating-point%20arithmetic\"&gt;floating-point arithmetic&lt;/a&gt; may lead to the loss of (possibly all) &lt;a href=\"significant%20figures\"&gt;significant figures&lt;/a&gt;, producing a large calculation error, possibly even a meaningless result.\nFollowing a proposal by &lt;a href=\"William%20Kahan\"&gt;William Kahan&lt;/a&gt;, it may thus be useful to have a dedicated routine, often called codice_1, for computing directly, bypassing computation of . For example, if the exponential is computed by using its &lt;a href=\"Taylor%20series\"&gt;Taylor series&lt;/a&gt;\none may use the Taylor series of formula_104\nThis was first implemented in 1979 in the &lt;a href=\"Hewlett-Packard\"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"HP-41C\"&gt;HP-41C&lt;/a&gt; calculator, and provided by several calculators, &lt;a href=\"operating%20system\"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;s (for example &lt;a href=\"Berkeley%20UNIX%204.3BSD\"&gt;Berkeley UNIX 4.3BSD&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"computer%20algebra%20system\"&gt;computer algebra system&lt;/a&gt;s, and programming languages (for example &lt;a href=\"C99\"&gt;C99&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn addition to base , the &lt;a href=\"IEEE%20754-2008\"&gt;IEEE 754-2008&lt;/a&gt; standard defines similar exponential functions near 0 for base 2 and 10: formula_106 and formula_107.\nA similar approach has been used for the logarithm (see &lt;a href=\"lnp1\"&gt;lnp1&lt;/a&gt;).\nAn identity in terms of the &lt;a href=\"hyperbolic%20tangent\"&gt;hyperbolic tangent&lt;/a&gt;,\ngives a high-precision value for small values of on systems that do not implement ."
