    "text": "Caviar (also known as caviare; from ) is a food consisting of salt-cured &lt;a href=\"roe\"&gt;roe&lt;/a&gt; of the family &lt;a href=\"Acipenseridae\"&gt;Acipenseridae&lt;/a&gt;. Caviar is considered a &lt;a href=\"delicacy\"&gt;delicacy&lt;/a&gt; and is eaten as a garnish or a spread. Traditionally, the term \"caviar\" refers only to roe from wild &lt;a href=\"sturgeon\"&gt;sturgeon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20Sea\"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Beluga%20%28sturgeon%29\"&gt;Beluga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ossetra\"&gt;Ossetra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sevruga\"&gt;Sevruga&lt;/a&gt; caviars). Depending on the country, \"caviar\" may also be used to describe the roe of other species of sturgeon or other &lt;a href=\"Fish%20%28food%29\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"steelhead\"&gt;steelhead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trout\"&gt;trout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyclopterus%20lumpus\"&gt;lumpfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freshwater%20whitefish\"&gt;whitefish&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"carp\"&gt;carp&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe roe can be \"fresh\" (non-pasteurized) or &lt;a href=\"pasteurized\"&gt;pasteurized&lt;/a&gt;, with pasteurization reducing its culinary and &lt;a href=\"economic%20value\"&gt;economic value&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerminology.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"United%20Nations\"&gt;United Nations'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization\"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt;, roe from any fish not belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Acipenseriformes\"&gt;Acipenseriformes&lt;/a&gt; order (including &lt;a href=\"Acipenseridae\"&gt;Acipenseridae&lt;/a&gt;, or sturgeon \"&lt;a href=\"sensu%20stricto\"&gt;sensu stricto&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Polyodontidae\"&gt;Polyodontidae&lt;/a&gt; or paddlefish) are not caviar, but \"substitutes of caviar.\" This position is also adopted by the &lt;a href=\"CITES\"&gt;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature\"&gt;World Wide Fund for Nature&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Customs%20Service\"&gt;United States Customs Service&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term \"caviar\" is sometimes used to describe dishes that are perceived to resemble caviar, such as \"&lt;a href=\"ajvar\"&gt;eggplant caviar&lt;/a&gt;\" (made from &lt;a href=\"eggplant\"&gt;eggplant&lt;/a&gt;) and \"&lt;a href=\"Texas%20caviar\"&gt;Texas caviar&lt;/a&gt;\" (made from &lt;a href=\"black-eyed%20pea\"&gt;black-eyed pea&lt;/a&gt;s).\nHistory.\nCaviar and sturgeon from the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Azov\"&gt;Sea of Azov&lt;/a&gt; began reaching the tables of aristocratic and noble &lt;a href=\"Greeks\"&gt;Greeks&lt;/a&gt; in the 10th century, after the commencement of large-scale trading between the &lt;a href=\"Byzantine%20Empire\"&gt;Byzantine Empire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kievan%20Rus%27\"&gt;Kievan Rus'&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarieties.\nThe main types of caviar are &lt;a href=\"Beluga%20caviar\"&gt;Beluga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sterlet\"&gt;Sterlet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaluga%20%28fish%29\"&gt;Kaluga hybrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"White%20sturgeon\"&gt;American osetra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ossetra\"&gt;Ossetra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siberian%20sturgeon\"&gt;Siberian sturgeon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sevruga\"&gt;Sevruga&lt;/a&gt;. The rarest and costliest is from beluga sturgeon that swim in the Caspian Sea, which is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Iran\"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turkmenistan\"&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Azerbaijan\"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;. Wild caviar production was suspended in Russia between 2008 and 2011 to allow wild stocks to replenish. Azerbaijan and Iran also allow the fishing of sturgeon off their coasts. Beluga caviar is prized for its soft, extremely large (pea-size) eggs. It can range in color from pale silver-gray to black. It is followed by the small golden &lt;a href=\"sterlet\"&gt;sterlet&lt;/a&gt; caviar which is rare and was once reserved for Russian, Iranian and Austrian royalty. Next in quality is the medium-sized, light brown to rich brown &lt;a href=\"Ossetra\"&gt;Ossetra&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Russian caviar. Others in the quality ranking are the gray sevruga caviar, the Chinese Kaluga caviar, and the American osetra. The Siberian variety with black beads is similar to sevruga and is popular because of its reduced (5 years) harvest period, but it has a higher &lt;a href=\"brine\"&gt;brine&lt;/a&gt; content than other kinds. The Chinese Kaluga hybrid varies in color from dark gray to light golden green and is a close cousin of beluga caviar.\nQuality factors and cost.\nAn expensive caviar example at sold for \u00a320,000 (then US$34,500) is the Iranian 'Almas' product (from , \"diamond\") produced from the eggs of a rare &lt;a href=\"albino\"&gt;albino&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sturgeon\"&gt;sturgeon&lt;/a&gt; between 60 and 100 years old from the southern &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20Sea\"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Wild beluga sturgeon caviar from the Caspian Sea was priced in 2012 at $16,000 per . Cheaper alternatives have been developed from the roe of &lt;a href=\"Coregonus\"&gt;whitefish&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"North%20Atlantic\"&gt;North Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;.\nConventional sturgeon caviar was priced in 2014 at about $105 per and from albino sturgeon up to $800 per ounce. Other quality factors are texture \u2013 with firmness having higher quality value \u2013 flavor qualities, such as &lt;a href=\"cream\"&gt;cream&lt;/a&gt;iness, &lt;a href=\"butter\"&gt;butter&lt;/a&gt; taste, and brine or mild fish &lt;a href=\"aftertaste\"&gt;finish&lt;/a&gt;, and whether the caviar was taken from the fish by &lt;a href=\"massage\"&gt;massage&lt;/a&gt; (higher value) rather than by killing it.\nIndustry.\nIran.\nIran supplies 10% of the world's caviar.\nChina.\nChina has emerged as the leading producer, accounting for 60% of the world production in caviar. The largest caviar company in the world is the Chinese brand &lt;a href=\"Kaluga%20Queen\"&gt;Kaluga Queen&lt;/a&gt;, which cultivates sturgeon at &lt;a href=\"Qiandao%20Lake\"&gt;Qiandao Lake&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zhejiang\"&gt;Zhejiang&lt;/a&gt;.\nIsrael.\n&lt;a href=\"Kibbutz%20Dan\"&gt;Kibbutz Dan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Israel\"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; produces 4 tons of caviar a year. The farm is fed by the &lt;a href=\"Dan%20River%20%28Middle%20East%29\"&gt;Dan River&lt;/a&gt;, a tributary of the &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20River\"&gt;Jordan River&lt;/a&gt;.\nItaly.\n&lt;a href=\"Cristoforo%20da%20Messisbugo\"&gt;Cristoforo da Messisbugo&lt;/a&gt; in his book \"Libro novo nel qual si insegna a far d'ogni sorte di vivanda\", Venice, 1564, at page 110, gave the first recorded recipe in Italy about extraction of the eggs from the roe and caviar preparation \"to be consumed fresh or to preserve\".\nThe writer and voyager &lt;a href=\"J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Lalande\"&gt;J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande&lt;/a&gt; in his book \"Voyage en Italie\", Paris, 1771, vol. 8, page 269, noted that many sturgeon were caught in the Po delta area in the territory of &lt;a href=\"Ferrara\"&gt;Ferrara&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1753 a diplomatic war broke out between the &lt;a href=\"Papal%20States\"&gt;Papal States&lt;/a&gt;, governing the Ferrara territory, and the &lt;a href=\"Venetian%20Republic\"&gt;Venetian Republic&lt;/a&gt; about sturgeon fishing rights in the Po river, the border between the two states. From about 1920 and until 1942 there was a shop in Ferrara, named \"Nuta\" from the nickname of the owner Benvenuta Ascoli, that processed all the sturgeons caught in the Po river for caviar extraction, using an elaboration of the original Messisbugo recipe, and shipped it to Italy and Europe. Production was sporadically continued by a new owner until 1972, when sturgeon stopped swimming up the Po river. Since 2015, some sturgeon have reappeared in the Po.\nCurrently, Italian caviar is obtained almost entirely from bred sturgeons. The caviar production is concentrated predominantly in &lt;a href=\"Brescia\"&gt;Brescia&lt;/a&gt;, which is considered the capital of Italian caviar: in this area, in &lt;a href=\"Calvisano\"&gt;Calvisano&lt;/a&gt;, is located the world's largest sturgeons farm that produces annually 25 tonnes of caviar. Italian caviar is generally the most sold and appreciated in the world: Italy is the world's leading producer.\nMadagascar.\nMadagascar is the first African country that produces and exports caviar since 2018.\nMalaysia.\nIn Malaysia, caviar production is relatively new and smaller in scale. Caviar is harvested from farmed sturgeon fish in &lt;a href=\"Tanjung%20Malim\"&gt;Tanjung Malim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Perak\"&gt;Perak&lt;/a&gt;. The caviar produced here is marketed as \"tropical caviar\". The first Malaysian brand of tropical caviar was launched in March 2019.\nMoldova (Transnistria).\nIn recent years Moldovan &lt;a href=\"breakaway%20state\"&gt;breakaway state&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Transnistria\"&gt;Transnistria&lt;/a&gt; built and put into operation a modern sturgeon complex for caviar production, producing natural black caviar of sterlet, bester, Russian sturgeon, and beluga. The design capacity of the fish-breeding zone is equal to 50\u201380 tons of commodity fish and 5 tons of caviar a year.\nNorth America.\nIn the early 20th century, &lt;a href=\"Canada\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; were the major caviar suppliers to &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;; they harvested roe from the &lt;a href=\"lake%20sturgeon\"&gt;lake sturgeon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Midwestern%20United%20States\"&gt;North American midwest&lt;/a&gt;, and from the &lt;a href=\"shortnose%20sturgeon\"&gt;shortnose sturgeon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20sturgeon\"&gt;Atlantic sturgeon&lt;/a&gt; spawning in the rivers of the Eastern coast of the United States. The American caviar industry got started when Henry Schacht, a German immigrant, opened a business catching sturgeon on the Delaware River. He treated his caviar with German salt and exported a great deal of it to Europe. At around the same time, sturgeon was fished from the Columbia River on the west coast, also supplying caviar. At the time, American caviar was so plentiful that it was given away at bars with the intent of inducing or prolonging thirst in patrons.\nToday, the shortnose sturgeon is rated \"Vulnerable\" in the &lt;a href=\"IUCN%20Red%20List\"&gt;IUCN Red List&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"endangered%20species\"&gt;endangered species&lt;/a&gt; and rated \"Endangered\" per the &lt;a href=\"Endangered%20Species%20Act\"&gt;Endangered Species Act&lt;/a&gt;. With the depletion of Caspian and Black Sea caviar, production of farmed or \"sustainable\" caviar has greatly increased. In particular, northern California is reported to account for 70% to 80% of U.S. production.\nIn Canada, a sturgeon farm called Target Marine Hatcheries is now the first producer of &lt;a href=\"organic%20certification\"&gt;organic&lt;/a&gt; caviar in North America called \"Northern Divine\".\nRussia.\nIn the wake of over-fishing, the harvest and sale of black caviar was banned in Russia in 2007. The ban on sturgeon fishing in the &lt;a href=\"Caspian%20Sea\"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt; has led to the development of &lt;a href=\"aquaculture\"&gt;aquaculture&lt;/a&gt; as an economically viable means of commercial caviar production.\nSpain.\nThe 17th-century book \"&lt;a href=\"Don%20Quixote\"&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/a&gt;\" mentions \"cavial\" in a banquet of German pilgrims.\nUntil 1992, sturgeons and caviar were collected at the lower parts of rivers &lt;a href=\"Guadalquivir\"&gt;Guadalquivir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebro\"&gt;Ebro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duero\"&gt;Duero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tajo\"&gt;Tajo&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1932 to 1970, the &lt;a href=\"Ybarra\"&gt;Ybarra&lt;/a&gt; family had a factory in &lt;a href=\"Coria%20del%20R%C3%ADo\"&gt;Coria del R\u00edo&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Overfishing\"&gt;Overfishing&lt;/a&gt;, pollution and the &lt;a href=\"Alcal%C3%A1%20del%20R%C3%ADo\"&gt;Alcal\u00e1 del R\u00edo&lt;/a&gt; dam eliminated the wild population of \"&lt;a href=\"Acipenser%20naccarii\"&gt;Acipenser naccarii&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn Spain, a fish farm called Caviar de Riofr\u00edo produces &lt;a href=\"organic%20certification\"&gt;organic&lt;/a&gt; caviar at &lt;a href=\"Loja%2C%20Granada\"&gt;Loja, Granada&lt;/a&gt;, Andalusia.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe &lt;a href=\"British%20royal%20family\"&gt;British royal family&lt;/a&gt; has held a long affinity with the sturgeon since 1324, when Edward II decreed it a &lt;a href=\"royal%20fish\"&gt;royal fish&lt;/a&gt;, whereby all sturgeons found within the foreshore of the Kingdom are decreed property of the monarch.\nUruguay.\nAs well as Canada and the United States, Uruguay has become a major producer and exporter.\nEcology.\nOver-fishing, smuggling and pollution caused by sewage entry into the Caspian Sea have considerably reduced the sea's sturgeon population.\nIn September 2005, the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service\"&gt;United States Fish and Wildlife Service&lt;/a&gt; banned the import of Caspian Sea Beluga caviar to protect the endangered Beluga sturgeon; a month later, the ban was extended to include Beluga caviar from the entire &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sea\"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; basin. In January 2006, the &lt;a href=\"Convention%20on%20the%20International%20Trade%20in%20Endangered%20Species%20of%20Wild%20Flora%20and%20Fauna\"&gt;Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna&lt;/a&gt; (CITES) supported an international embargo on caviar export. In January 2007, this ban was partly lifted, allowing the sale of 96 tons of caviar, 15% below the official 2005 level. In July 2010, Russia and some other &lt;a href=\"Commonwealth%20of%20Independent%20States\"&gt;CIS&lt;/a&gt; countries restarted the export of caviar. The 2010 quotas allow for the export of three tons of beluga, 17 tons of sevruga and 27 tons of osetra. In September 2010, &lt;a href=\"Kazakhstan\"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; launched a &lt;a href=\"state%20monopoly\"&gt;state monopoly&lt;/a&gt; brand, Zhaik Balyk, from the Kazakh word for the &lt;a href=\"Ural%20River\"&gt;Ural River&lt;/a&gt;. Under the CITES agreement, Kazakhstan was granted the right to produce 13 out of the 80 tons allowed up until 28 February 2011.\nExtraction.\nCommercial caviar production historically involved stunning the fish and extracting the &lt;a href=\"ovaries\"&gt;ovaries&lt;/a&gt;. Another method of extracting caviar is by performing a &lt;a href=\"caesarean%20section\"&gt;caesarean section&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the female to continue producing roe. Other farmers use a process called \"stripping\", which extracts the caviar from the fish via a small incision made along the urogenital muscle when the fish is deemed to be ready to be processed. An ultrasound is used to determine the correct timing. Removing the caviar by massage may yield higher quality and a more sustainable source.\nPreparation.\nPreparation follows a sequence that has not significantly changed over the last century. First, the ovaries are removed from a sedated female sturgeon and passed through a sieve to remove the membrane. Freed roes are rinsed to wash away impurities. Roes are now ready to become caviar by adding a precise amount of salt for taste and preservation. The fresh product is tasted and graded according to quality. Finally, the golden eggs are packed into lacquer-lined tins that will be further processed or sold directly to customers.\nSubstitutes.\nIn coastal &lt;a href=\"British%20Columbia\"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fraser%20River\"&gt;Fraser River&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"white%20sturgeon\"&gt;white sturgeon&lt;/a&gt; are sustainably &lt;a href=\"aquaculture\"&gt;farmed&lt;/a&gt; to produce caviar.\nA sturgeon caviar imitation is a black or red coloured &lt;a href=\"Cyclopterus%20lumpus\"&gt;lumpsucker&lt;/a&gt; caviar sold throughout Europe in small glass jars.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Sweden\"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Finland\"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; the roes of many fish species including &lt;a href=\"Coregonus%20albula\"&gt;vendace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"burbot\"&gt;burbot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"common%20whitefish\"&gt;common whitefish&lt;/a&gt; are also commonly eaten in a similar manner as caviar. They are not caviar 'substitutes', however, but enjoyed in their own right.\nThere are also kosher and vegan caviar substitutes made of &lt;a href=\"seaweeds\"&gt;seaweeds&lt;/a&gt; such as \"&lt;a href=\"Laminaria%20hyperborea\"&gt;Laminaria hyperborea&lt;/a&gt;\". They closely resemble beluga caviar in appearance and are either used as a food prop for television and film, or enjoyed by vegetarians and other people throughout the world.\nAnother common technique is to use &lt;a href=\"spherification\"&gt;spherification&lt;/a&gt; of liquids to recreate the texture, albeit not the flavour, of caviar.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Scandinavia\"&gt;Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;, a type of sandwich &lt;a href=\"spread%20%28food%29\"&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; is available, made from &lt;a href=\"Smoking%20%28cooking%29\"&gt;smoked&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt; roe and other ingredients, which is referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5skaviar\"&gt;sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar&lt;/a&gt;\" (meaning \"sandwich caviar\"). Outside Scandinavia, the product is referred to as \"creamed smoked roe\" or in French as \"Caviar de Lysekil\".\nStorage and nutritional information.\nCaviar is extremely perishable and must be kept refrigerated until consumption.\nPasteurized caviar has a slightly different texture. It is less perishable and may not require refrigeration before opening.\nPressed caviar is composed of damaged or fragile eggs and can be a combination of several different roes. It is specially treated, salted, and pressed.\nA spoonful of caviar supplies the adult daily requirement of &lt;a href=\"vitamin%20B12\"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt;, it is also high in &lt;a href=\"cholesterol\"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and salt.\n1 tablespoon (16 g) of caviar contains:"
