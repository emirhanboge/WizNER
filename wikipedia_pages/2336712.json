He played in the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20First%20Division%20League\"&gt;Hong Kong Football League&lt;/a&gt; for 4 seasons in total, moving from Kui Tan to &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Hei\"&gt;Golden&lt;/a&gt; then on to &lt;a href=\"South%20China%20AA\"&gt;South China&lt;/a&gt;.

He immediately became an integral part of their play-off push after making his debut on 7 August in a 3\u20130 defeat on the opening day of the season at &lt;a href=\"Hillsborough%20Stadium\"&gt;Hillsborough&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Colchester%20United%20F.C.\"&gt;Colchester United&lt;/a&gt; and scoring his first goal the next game on 10 August, away at &lt;a href=\"Blackpool%20F.C.\"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt; to lead the team to a 2\u20131 victory.

He did however appear in the end of season lap-of-honour and received a spectacular reception from the fans.
