    "text": "The Rothschild banking family of England was founded in (1798) by &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Mayer%20Rothschild\"&gt;Nathan Mayer von Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (1777\u20131836) who first settled in &lt;a href=\"Manchester\"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt; but then moved to &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; (at the time in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain\"&gt;Kingdom of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;). Nathan was sent there from his home in &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt; by his father, &lt;a href=\"Mayer%20Amschel%20Rothschild\"&gt;Mayer Amschel Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (1744\u20131812). Wanting his sons to succeed on their own and to expand the family business across &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, Mayer Amschel Rothschild had his eldest son remain in Frankfurt, while his four other sons were sent to different European cities to establish a financial institution to invest in business and provide banking services. Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son, first established a &lt;a href=\"textile\"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt; jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish &lt;a href=\"N%20M%20Rothschild%20%26amp%3B%20Sons\"&gt;N M Rothschild &amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt; bank in London.\nFrom the home base in &lt;a href=\"Frankfurt\"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, Rothschild sons not only established themselves in the UK but also in &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vienna\"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Two%20Sicilies\"&gt;Two Sicilies&lt;/a&gt;. Through their collaborative efforts, the Rothschilds rose to prominence in a variety of banking endeavours including &lt;a href=\"loan\"&gt;loan&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"government%20bond\"&gt;government bond&lt;/a&gt;s and trading in &lt;a href=\"bullion\"&gt;bullion&lt;/a&gt;. Their financing afforded investment opportunities and during the 19th century they became major stakeholders in large-scale &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rail%20transport\"&gt;rail transport&lt;/a&gt; ventures that were fundamental to the rapidly expanding industrial economies of &lt;a href=\"Europe\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.\nChanges in the heads of government, war, and other such events affected the family's fortunes both for their benefit and to their detriment at various times. Despite such changes, the UK branch of the Rothschild family is arguably the most prominent of all the Rothschild branches due its elevation to the British peerage, and its continued high-profile philanthropic activities.\nInvolvement in finance and industry.\nDuring the early part of the 19th century, the Rothschild's London bank took a leading part in managing and financing the subsidies that the British government transferred to its allies during the &lt;a href=\"Napoleonic%20Wars\"&gt;Napoleonic Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Through the creation of a network of agents, couriers and shippers, the bank was able to provide funds to the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington\"&gt;Duke of Wellington&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Portugal\"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, therefore funding war. In 1818 the Rothschild bank arranged a \u00a35 million loan to the &lt;a href=\"Prussia\"&gt;Prussia&lt;/a&gt;n government and the issuing of &lt;a href=\"Bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bonds&lt;/a&gt; for government &lt;a href=\"loan\"&gt;loan&lt;/a&gt;s. The providing of other innovative and complex financing for government projects formed a mainstay of the bank's business for the better part of the century. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons financial strength in the &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20London\"&gt;City of London&lt;/a&gt; became such that by 1825\u201326, the bank was able to supply enough coin to the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20England\"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt; to enable it to avert a &lt;a href=\"market%20liquidity\"&gt;liquidity&lt;/a&gt; crisis.\nNathan Mayer's eldest son, &lt;a href=\"Lionel%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;Lionel de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (1808\u20131879) succeeded him as head of the London branch. Under Lionel the bank financed the British government's 1875 purchase of &lt;a href=\"Egypt\"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;'s interest in the &lt;a href=\"Suez%20Canal\"&gt;Suez Canal&lt;/a&gt;. Lionel also began to invest in railways as his uncle &lt;a href=\"James%20Mayer%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; had been doing in France. In 1869, Lionel's son, &lt;a href=\"Alfred%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;Alfred de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (1842\u20131918), became a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20directors%20of%20the%20Bank%20of%20England\"&gt;director of the Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;, a post he held for 20 years. Alfred was one of those who represented the British Government at the 1892 &lt;a href=\"International%20Monetary%20Conferences\"&gt;International Monetary Conference&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Brussels\"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rothschild bank funded &lt;a href=\"Cecil%20Rhodes\"&gt;Cecil Rhodes&lt;/a&gt; in the development of the &lt;a href=\"British%20South%20Africa%20Company\"&gt;British South Africa Company&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leopold%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;Leopold de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (1845\u20131917) administered Rhodes's estate after his death in 1902 and helped to set up the &lt;a href=\"Rhodes%20Scholarship\"&gt;Rhodes Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; scheme at &lt;a href=\"Oxford%20University\"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt;. In 1873, &lt;a href=\"de%20Rothschild%20Fr%C3%A8res\"&gt;de Rothschild Fr\u00e8res&lt;/a&gt; in France and N M Rothschild &amp; Sons of &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; joined with other investors to acquire the Spanish government's money-losing &lt;a href=\"Rio%20Tinto%20Group\"&gt;Rio Tinto&lt;/a&gt; copper mines. The new owners restructured the company and turned it into a profitable business. By 1905, the Rothschild interest in Rio Tinto amounted to more than 30 percent. In 1887, the French and UK Rothschild banking houses loaned money to, and invested in, the &lt;a href=\"De%20Beers\"&gt;De Beers&lt;/a&gt; diamond mines in &lt;a href=\"South%20Africa\"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, becoming its largest shareholders.\nThe London banking house continued under the management of &lt;a href=\"Lionel%20Nathan%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;Lionel Nathan de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (1882\u20131942) and his brother &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Gustav%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;Anthony Gustav de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (1887\u20131961) and then to &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Evelyn%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;Sir Evelyn de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (b. 1931). In 2003, following Sir Evelyn's retirement as head of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons of &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, the UK and French financial firms merged under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"David%20Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;David Ren\u00e9 de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther activities.\nBeyond banking and finance, members of the Rothschild family in the UK became &lt;a href=\"academic\"&gt;academic&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scientist\"&gt;scientist&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"horticulture\"&gt;horticulturalists&lt;/a&gt; with worldwide reputations.\n&lt;a href=\"Nathaniel%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;Nathaniel de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (1812\u20131870) was born in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth child of the founder of the British branch of the family. In 1842, he married cousin &lt;a href=\"Charlotte%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;Charlotte de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (1825\u20131899) of &lt;a href=\"Paris\"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"France\"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. She was the daughter of &lt;a href=\"James%20Mayer%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;James Mayer de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; and in 1850 they moved to Paris where he was to work for his father-in-law's bank. However, in 1853, Nathaniel acquired Ch\u00e2teau Brane Mouton, a &lt;a href=\"vineyard\"&gt;vineyard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pauillac\"&gt;Pauillac&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gironde\"&gt;Gironde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"d%C3%A9partement\"&gt;d\u00e9partement&lt;/a&gt; of France.\nElevation to British peerage.\nIn 1822, the five Rothschild brothers at the head of the family's banks in various parts of Europe were each granted the title of &lt;a href=\"baron\"&gt;baron&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Freiherr\"&gt;Freiherr&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Austria\"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Francis I&lt;/a&gt;, formerly &lt;a href=\"Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Francis II&lt;/a&gt; the last &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\"&gt;Holy Roman Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. As such, some members of the family used \"de\" or \"von\" Rothschild to acknowledge the grant of nobility.\nIn 1847, &lt;a href=\"Anthony%20Nathan%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;Anthony Nathan de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (1810\u20131876) was created \"1st Baronet de Rothschild, of &lt;a href=\"Tring\"&gt;Tring Park&lt;/a&gt;\". On his death, the title went to his nephew &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Mayer%20Rothschild%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rothschild\"&gt;Nathan Mayer Rothschild II&lt;/a&gt; who was subsequently elevated to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Lords\"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt; and created &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rothschild\"&gt;Baron Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; in 1885 with which title the baronetcy remains merged.\nIn 1850 &lt;a href=\"Lionel%20de%20Rothschild\"&gt;Lionel de Rothschild&lt;/a&gt; (1808\u20131879) became the first practising Jewish member of the &lt;a href=\"British%20House%20of%20Commons\"&gt;British Parliament&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhilanthropy.\nThe English Rothschilds and members of the other branches in Europe were all major contributors to causes in aid of the Jewish people. However, many of their philanthropic efforts extended far beyond Jewish ethnic or religious communities. They built hospitals and shelters for the needy, supported cultural institutions and were patrons of individual artists. Their donation of works of art to various galleries has been the largest of any family in history. At present, a research project is underway by The Rothschild Archive &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20130823152508/http%3A//www.rothschildarchive.org/ib/%3Fdoc%3D%252Fib%252Farticles%252Fproject1pd\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in London to document the family's philanthropic involvements.\nFamily members.\nMembers of the Rothschild family of the UK include:\nRothschild properties.\nAmong the Rothschild properties in the UK are:"
