    "title": "Box blade",
    "text": "A box blade is a type of &lt;a href=\"Agricultural%20machinery\"&gt;implement&lt;/a&gt; used on &lt;a href=\"tractor\"&gt;tractor&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Asmoothing\"&gt;smoothing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Contour%20plowing\"&gt;contouring&lt;/a&gt; land. It is almost always unpowered, though can have auxiliary &lt;a href=\"Hydraulic%20machinery\"&gt;hydraulics&lt;/a&gt; attached in order for adjustments to be made without leaving the &lt;a href=\"seat\"&gt;seat&lt;/a&gt; of the tractor. It is attached to the tractor via the &lt;a href=\"Three-point%20hitch\"&gt;three point hitch&lt;/a&gt;.\nBox blades are a variation of the rear &lt;a href=\"blade\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt; which has developed into its own implement, with uses that parallel that of a rear blade, but are distinct. They consist of a heavy metal 3 sided box, with the front, top and bottom open. The front has retractable &lt;a href=\"Dethatcher\"&gt;scarifiers&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to break up hard ground. The rear has a forward and reverse cutting edge mounted at the bottom, with the reverse cutting edge often gated or floating on more expensive models. Box blades are usually very heavy due to the &lt;a href=\"force\"&gt;force&lt;/a&gt;s placed on them - even a lightweight one will weigh 500 &lt;a href=\"Pound%20%28mass%29\"&gt;pounds&lt;/a&gt;. The implement works going forward by scraping soil, carrying it forward as it rolls inside the box, and allowing some to work out as the blade passes over low spots. It works going back much like a dozer blade, pushing dirt, which can spill out the bottom or sides. Unlike a dozer blade, box blades are not adjustable relative to the tractor more than a few degrees in any direction, and generally only when the operator dismounts the tractor.\nBox blades are primarily used for moving &lt;a href=\"Soil\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, smoothing &lt;a href=\"land\"&gt;land&lt;/a&gt;, and contouring land. Most major tractor implement &lt;a href=\"Manufacturing\"&gt;manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; make box blades, including Cammond, Woods, Gannon, &amp; BushHog. Commercial &lt;a href=\"Laser%20guidance\"&gt;laser guided&lt;/a&gt; models are coming into use which automatically level the blade via &lt;a href=\"reference\"&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt; to an external &lt;a href=\"laser\"&gt;laser&lt;/a&gt;.\nThree point &lt;a href=\"Grader\"&gt;road graders&lt;/a&gt; can be viewed as a specific type of box blade, and are used to &lt;a href=\"Grading%20%28engineering%29\"&gt;grade&lt;/a&gt; and maintain &lt;a href=\"Dirt%20road\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gravel%20road\"&gt;gravel road&lt;/a&gt;s. They usually have 2 parallel &lt;a href=\"angle\"&gt;angle&lt;/a&gt;d cutting edges, and long, low sidepieces. Manufacturers include Dura-Grader, Road Boss, and RoadRunner."
