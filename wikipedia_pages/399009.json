The first name on Maggie's birth certificate is \"Margalit\", which she did not discover until 2013, when adopting her husband's surname. \"&lt;a href=\"Margalit%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;Margalit&lt;/a&gt;\" () is a &lt;a href=\"Hebrew%20language\"&gt;Hebrew&lt;/a&gt; word meaning \"pearl\"; some news stories have spelled it \"Margolit\". She has two brothers; actor &lt;a href=\"Jake%20Gyllenhaal\"&gt;Jake Gyllenhaal&lt;/a&gt; and a half-brother named Luke from their father's second marriage.\nHer father is a film director and poet, and her mother is a screenwriter and director. Her father, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Swedish%20nobility\"&gt;noble&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gyllenhaal%20family\"&gt;Gyllenhaal family&lt;/a&gt;, is of Swedish and English ancestry, and was raised in the &lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Church\"&gt;Swedenborgian&lt;/a&gt; religion. Her last native Swedish ancestor was her great-great-grandfather Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal, a descendant of &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Gyllenhaal\"&gt;Leonard Gyllenhaal&lt;/a&gt;, a leading Swedenborgian who supported the printing and spreading of Swedenborg's writings.\nHer mother was born in New York City (growing up in &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;), and is &lt;a href=\"Jews\"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Ashkenazi%20Jewish\"&gt;Ashkenazi Jewish&lt;/a&gt; families that emigrated from Russia and Poland.

Her parents married in 1977, and filed for divorce in October 2008.\nGyllenhaal grew up in Los Angeles and studied at the &lt;a href=\"Harvard-Westlake%20School\"&gt;Harvard\u2013Westlake&lt;/a&gt; prep school. She spent four months as a student at &lt;a href=\"The%20Mountain%20School\"&gt;The Mountain School&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"semester%20school\"&gt;semester school&lt;/a&gt; for high school juniors in Vermont. In 1995, she graduated from Harvard\u2013Westlake and moved to New York to attend &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20University\"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;, where she studied literature and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20religions\"&gt;Eastern religions&lt;/a&gt;. She also studied acting for a summer term at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art\"&gt;Royal Academy of Dramatic Art&lt;/a&gt; (RADA) in London, England.\nCareer.\n1992\u20132001: Early work.\nAt the age of 15, she made a brief appearance in her father's film \"&lt;a href=\"Waterland%20%28film%29\"&gt;Waterland&lt;/a&gt;\" (1992). Soon, she had supporting roles in \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Dangerous%20Woman%20%281993%20film%29\"&gt;A Dangerous Woman&lt;/a&gt;\" (1993) and \"&lt;a href=\"Homegrown%20%28film%29\"&gt;Homegrown&lt;/a&gt;\" (1998), which were directed by her father, which also featured her brother Jake. With their mother, she and Jake appeared in two episodes of \"Molto Mario\", an Italian cooking show on the &lt;a href=\"Food%20Network\"&gt;Food Network&lt;/a&gt;. After graduating from college, she had supporting roles in films including \"&lt;a href=\"Cecil%20B.%20Demented\"&gt;Cecil B. Demented&lt;/a&gt;\" (2000) and \"&lt;a href=\"Riding%20in%20Cars%20with%20Boys\"&gt;Riding in Cars with Boys&lt;/a&gt;\" (2001). Gyllenhaal later achieved recognition in her own right playing her real brother's on-screen sister in the &lt;a href=\"independent%20film\"&gt;indie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cult%20following\"&gt;cult favorite&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Donnie%20Darko\"&gt;Donnie Darko&lt;/a&gt;\" (2001).\nShe made her theatrical debut in the &lt;a href=\"Berkeley%20Repertory%20Theatre\"&gt;Berkeley Repertory Theatre&lt;/a&gt; production of &lt;a href=\"Patrick%20Marber\"&gt;Patrick Marber&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Closer%20%28play%29\"&gt;Closer&lt;/a&gt;\", for which she received favorable reviews. Production started in May 2000 and ended in mid-July of that year. Gyllenhaal has performed in several other plays, including \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tempest\"&gt;The Tempest&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Antony%20and%20Cleopatra\"&gt;Antony and Cleopatra&lt;/a&gt;\", \"The Butterfly Project\", and \"&lt;a href=\"No%20Exit\"&gt;No Exit&lt;/a&gt;\".\n2002\u20132005: Film breakthrough.\nGyllenhaal's breakout role was in the &lt;a href=\"black%20comedy\"&gt;black comedy&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Secretary%20%282002%20film%29\"&gt;Secretary&lt;/a&gt;\" (2002), a film about two people who embark on a mutually fulfilling &lt;a href=\"BDSM\"&gt;BDSM&lt;/a&gt; lifestyle. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Times\"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" critic &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Holden\"&gt;Stephen Holden&lt;/a&gt; noted: \"The role of Lee, which Maggie Gyllenhaal imbues with a restrained comic delicacy and sweetness, should make her a star.\" &lt;a href=\"Mick%20LaSalle\"&gt;Mick LaSalle&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco%20Chronicle\"&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote: \"Maggie Gyllenhaal, as the self-destructive secretary, is enigmatic and, at moments, sympathetic.\" The film received generally favorable reviews, and Gyllenhaal's performance earned her the Best Breakthrough Performance by an Actress award from the &lt;a href=\"National%20Board%20of%20Review%20of%20Motion%20Pictures\"&gt;National Board of Review of Motion Pictures&lt;/a&gt;, her first &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Globe%20Award\"&gt;Golden Globe&lt;/a&gt; nomination, and an &lt;a href=\"Independent%20Spirit%20Award\"&gt;Independent Spirit Award&lt;/a&gt; nomination. \"Secretary\" was Gyllenhaal's first film role which featured &lt;a href=\"nudity%20in%20film\"&gt;full frontal nudity&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed with the script, she initially had reservations about doing the film, which she believed could deliver an &lt;a href=\"Antifeminism\"&gt;anti-feminist&lt;/a&gt; message. However, after carefully discussing the script with the film's director, &lt;a href=\"Steven%20Shainberg\"&gt;Steven Shainberg&lt;/a&gt;, she agreed to join the project. Although insisting Shainberg did not exploit her, Gyllenhaal has said she felt \"scared when filming began\" and that \"in the wrong hands\u00a0... even in just slightly less intelligent hands, this movie could say something really weird.\" Since then, she is guarded about discussing her role in the film, saying only that \"despite myself, sometimes the dynamic that you are exploring in your work spills over into your life.\"Next, she had a supporting role in the comedy-drama \"&lt;a href=\"Adaptation%20%28film%29\"&gt;Adaptation&lt;/a&gt;\" (2002), a film that tells the story of screenwriter &lt;a href=\"Charlie%20Kaufman\"&gt;Charlie Kaufman&lt;/a&gt;'s struggle to adapt \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Orchid%20Thief\"&gt;The Orchid Thief&lt;/a&gt;\" into a film. She later appeared in the &lt;a href=\"unauthorized%20biography\"&gt;unauthorized biography&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Confessions%20of%20a%20Dangerous%20Mind%20%28film%29\"&gt;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&lt;/a&gt;\" (2002), part of an ensemble cast that included &lt;a href=\"Sam%20Rockwell\"&gt;Sam Rockwell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drew%20Barrymore\"&gt;Drew Barrymore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"George%20Clooney\"&gt;George Clooney&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Julia%20Roberts\"&gt;Julia Roberts&lt;/a&gt;. The movie grossed US$33 million worldwide. That same year, she had a small role in the comedy \"&lt;a href=\"40%20Days%20and%2040%20Nights\"&gt;40 Days and 40 Nights&lt;/a&gt;\". In 2003, she co-starred with Julia Roberts in \"&lt;a href=\"Mona%20Lisa%20Smile\"&gt;Mona Lisa Smile&lt;/a&gt;\" in the role of Giselle. In an interview with \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daily%20Telegraph\"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;\", she revealed the reason for accepting the role was \"to play somebody who feels confident in herself as a sexy, beautiful woman\". The film generated mostly mixed reviews, with &lt;a href=\"Manohla%20Dargis\"&gt;Manohla Dargis&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles%20Times\"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;\" describing it as \"smug and reductive\". Her next roles were in smaller independent films: \"&lt;a href=\"Casa%20de%20los%20Babys\"&gt;Casa de los Babys&lt;/a&gt;\" (2003), is a story about six American women impatiently waiting out their lengthy residency requirements in a South American country before picking up their adoptive babies, and \"&lt;a href=\"Criminal%20%282004%20film%29\"&gt;Criminal&lt;/a&gt;\" (2004), a remake of the Argentinian film \"&lt;a href=\"Nine%20Queens\"&gt;Nine Queens&lt;/a&gt;\", with &lt;a href=\"John%20C.%20Reilly\"&gt;John C. Reilly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diego%20Luna\"&gt;Diego Luna&lt;/a&gt;. Gyllenhaal plays an honest hotel manager forced to help her crooked brother (Reilly) by seducing one of his victims.\nShe starred in the &lt;a href=\"HBO\"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; film \"&lt;a href=\"Strip%20Search%20%28film%29\"&gt;Strip Search&lt;/a&gt;\" (2004), in which she portrayed an American student in China suspected of terrorism. For her role, Gyllenhaal had to perform multiple scenes of &lt;a href=\"Nudity\"&gt;full-frontal nudity&lt;/a&gt; as the film tackled issues of &lt;a href=\"strip%20search\"&gt;strip search&lt;/a&gt;es. In 2004, Gyllenhaal returned to theater in a Los Angeles production of &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Kushner\"&gt;Tony Kushner&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Homebody/ Kabul\" as Priscilla, the Homebody's daughter, who spends most of the play searching for her elusive mother in &lt;a href=\"Kabul\"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Afghanistan\"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. Kushner gave her the role in \"Homebody/ Kabul\" on the strength of her performance in \"Closer\". &lt;a href=\"Ben%20Brantley\"&gt;Ben Brantley&lt;/a&gt; of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"Ms. Gyllenhaal provides the essential bridge between the parts of the play's title.\" &lt;a href=\"John%20Heilpern\"&gt;John Heilpern&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20York%20Observer\"&gt;The New York Observer&lt;/a&gt;\" noted that Gyllenhaal's performance was \"compelling\". Finally in 2004, Gyllenhaal was invited to join the &lt;a href=\"Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences\"&gt;Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. Viewed as a &lt;a href=\"sex%20symbol\"&gt;sex symbol&lt;/a&gt;, she was ranked in the \"Hot 100 List\" by \"&lt;a href=\"Maxim%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Maxim&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine in 2004 and 2005.\nGyllenhaal's next film role was in the 2005 comedy-drama \"&lt;a href=\"Happy%20Endings%20%28film%29\"&gt;Happy Endings&lt;/a&gt;\", in which she played an adventuress singer who seduces a young gay musician (&lt;a href=\"Jason%20Ritter\"&gt;Jason Ritter&lt;/a&gt;) as well as his rich father (&lt;a href=\"Tom%20Arnold%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Tom Arnold&lt;/a&gt;). She recorded songs for the film's soundtrack, calling the role the \"roughest, scariest acting ever\" and adding she is more natural when singing on screen than when acting. &lt;a href=\"Lisa%20Schwarzbaum\"&gt;Lisa Schwarzbaum&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Entertainment%20Weekly\"&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;\" declared Gyllenhaal's performance \"as wonderfully, naturally slouchy-sexy as her character is artificial\".\n2006\u20132009: Comedies, dramas and theatre.\nFollowing \"Happy Endings\", Gyllenhaal appeared in five films releases in 2006: \"&lt;a href=\"Trust%20the%20Man\"&gt;Trust the Man&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Stranger%20than%20Fiction%20%282006%20film%29\"&gt;Stranger than Fiction&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Monster%20House%20%28film%29\"&gt;Monster House&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"World%20Trade%20Center%20%28film%29\"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Sherrybaby\"&gt;Sherrybaby&lt;/a&gt;\". In \"Trust the Man\", featuring &lt;a href=\"Julianne%20Moore\"&gt;Julianne Moore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"David%20Duchovny\"&gt;David Duchovny&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Crudup\"&gt;Billy Crudup&lt;/a&gt;, she played Elaine, who has been dating Tobey, Crudup's character, for seven years and has begun to feel that it is time for her to settle down and start a family. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. Ethan Alter of \"&lt;a href=\"Premiere%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Premiere&lt;/a&gt;\" felt that the performances by Gyllenhaal and Duchovny were \"much more at ease\" and concluded with \"that's probably because they're played these characters many times before\". In \"Stranger than Fiction\", Gyllenhaal played a love interest of Harold Crick, played by &lt;a href=\"Will%20Ferrell\"&gt;Will Ferrell&lt;/a&gt;. Her performance in the film received favorable reviews; &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Straka\"&gt;Mike Straka&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Fox%20News%20Channel\"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; wrote: \"Gyllenhaal has never been sexier in any film before and her interplay with Ferrell will propel her to more &lt;a href=\"A-list\"&gt;A-list&lt;/a&gt; films, leaving her indie-darling days behind, no doubt.\" She voiced Elizabeth \"Zee\" in the &lt;a href=\"computer%20animation\"&gt;computer animated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"horror%20film\"&gt;horror film&lt;/a&gt; \"Monster House\". Gyllenhaal played Allison Jimeno, the wife of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Authority%20of%20New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Port Authority&lt;/a&gt; officer &lt;a href=\"Will%20Jimeno\"&gt;Will Jimeno&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Stone\"&gt;Oliver Stone&lt;/a&gt;'s \"World Trade Center\", based on the &lt;a href=\"September%2011%20attacks\"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt; in New York City. She regarded this as \"one of the films she most enjoyed making\". The film received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, earning US$162\u00a0million worldwide.\nIn \"Sherrybaby\", Gyllenhaal played a young drug-addicted thief trying to put her life in order after prison so she can reconcile with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: \"I think she's in such dire straits that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hopes. And while I was playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And so it was really mostly after I finished the movie that I felt pain.\" Her performance in the film was well-received; David Germain of the \"&lt;a href=\"Associated%20Press\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;\" wrote, \"Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly\u00a0... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments\", and Dennis Harvey of \"&lt;a href=\"Variety%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine called her performance \"naturalistic\". For her performance, Gyllenhaal earned a second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 &lt;a href=\"Stockholm%20International%20Film%20Festival\"&gt;Stockholm International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Knight%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/a&gt;\" (2008), the sequel to \"&lt;a href=\"Batman%20Begins\"&gt;Batman Begins&lt;/a&gt;\" (2005), in which she replaced &lt;a href=\"Katie%20Holmes\"&gt;Katie Holmes&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Prosecutor\"&gt;Assistant District Attorney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rachel%20Dawes\"&gt;Rachel Dawes&lt;/a&gt;. Gyllenhaal acknowledged her character was a &lt;a href=\"damsel%20in%20distress\"&gt;damsel in distress&lt;/a&gt; to an extent, but said director &lt;a href=\"Christopher%20Nolan\"&gt;Christopher Nolan&lt;/a&gt; sought ways to empower her character, so \"Rachel's really clear about what's important to her and unwilling to compromise her morals, which made a nice change\" from the many conflicted characters she had previously portrayed. \"The Dark Knight\" was a critical and commercial success, setting a new opening weekend &lt;a href=\"box%20office\"&gt;box office&lt;/a&gt; record for North America. With revenue of $1\u00a0billion worldwide, it became the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20highest-grossing%20films\"&gt;fourth-highest-grossing film&lt;/a&gt; of all time, and remains Gyllenhaal's most commercially successful feature to date. In a \"&lt;a href=\"Salon%20%28website%29\"&gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt;\" magazine review of the film, &lt;a href=\"Stephanie%20Zacharek\"&gt;Stephanie Zacharek&lt;/a&gt; called Gyllenhaal's character \"a tough cookie in a &lt;a href=\"Barbara%20Stanwyck\"&gt;Stanwyck&lt;/a&gt;-style bias-cut dress\" and stated that \"the movie feels smarter and more supple when she's on-screen\". \"&lt;a href=\"IGN\"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt;\" film critic Todd Gilchrist wrote, \"Gyllenhaal adds real depth and energy to Rachel Dawes\".\nIn addition to film, Gyllenhaal played Yelena Andreevna in the &lt;a href=\"Classic%20Stage%20Company\"&gt;Classic Stage Company&lt;/a&gt;'s 2009 &lt;a href=\"Off-Broadway\"&gt;Off-Broadway&lt;/a&gt; production of &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Chekhov\"&gt;Anton Chekhov&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Vanya\"&gt;Uncle Vanya&lt;/a&gt;\" in New York City. The cast also included her husband Peter Sarsgaard. The production, directed by &lt;a href=\"Austin%20Pendleton\"&gt;Austin Pendleton&lt;/a&gt;, began previews on January 17 and ended its limited run on March 1. Joe Dziemianowicz of the &lt;a href=\"Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29\"&gt;\"New York Daily News\"&lt;/a&gt; was unenthusiastic about her performance, writing \"Gyllenhaal, who was so dynamic as a druggie in the film \"Sherrybaby\", plays Yelena with a slow-mo saunter and monotonous pasted-on smile that makes it seem as if she's been in Sherry's stash.\" However, Malcolm Johnson of the \"&lt;a href=\"Hartford%20Courant\"&gt;Hartford Courant&lt;/a&gt;\" was complimentary, noting that she \"ultimately blossoms\" as the character.\nGyllenhaal agreed to star in the comedy \"&lt;a href=\"Away%20We%20Go\"&gt;Away We Go&lt;/a&gt;\" (2009), in which she plays a bohemian college professor who is an old friend of &lt;a href=\"John%20Krasinski\"&gt;John Krasinski&lt;/a&gt;'s character. The film generated broadly mixed reviews, with &lt;a href=\"Owen%20Gleiberman\"&gt;Owen Gleiberman&lt;/a&gt; of \"Entertainment Weekly\" describing Gyllenhaal's subplot as \"over-the-top\". However, &lt;a href=\"A.%20O.%20Scott\"&gt;A. O.
