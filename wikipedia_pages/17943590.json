    "text": "The academics of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Southern%20California\"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt; center on The College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, the Graduate School, and its 17 professional schools.\nOverview.\nUSC is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20American%20Universities\"&gt;Association of American Universities&lt;/a&gt;, joining in 1969. The University of Southern California houses professional schools offering a number of varying disciplines among which include communication, &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dentistry\"&gt;dentistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"medicine\"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"business\"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"journalism\"&gt;journalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"public%20policy\"&gt;public policy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"architecture\"&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Film\"&gt;cinematic arts&lt;/a&gt;. USC's academic departments fall either under the general &lt;a href=\"liberal%20arts\"&gt;liberal arts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"science\"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;s of the College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences for undergraduates, the Graduate School for graduates, or the university's 17 professional schools.\nDana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.\nThe USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the oldest and largest of the USC schools, grants undergraduate degrees in more than 130 majors and minors in the humanities, social sciences, and natural/physical sciences, and offers doctoral and masters programs in over 20 fields. USC College is responsible for the general education program for all USC undergraduates, and houses a full-time faculty of approximately 700, more than 6,500 undergraduate majors (roughly half the total USC undergraduate population), and 1,200 doctoral students. In addition to 30 academic departments, the College also houses dozens of research centers and institutes. In 2007, Howard Gillman, Professor of Political Science, History, and Law, was appointed the 20th Dean of the College. In the 2008-2009 academic year, 4,400 undergraduate degrees and 5,500 advanced degrees were awarded. All Ph.D. degrees awarded at USC and most master's degrees are under the jurisdiction of the Graduate School. Professional degrees are awarded by each of the respective professional schools. In 2011, the college changed its name from College of Letters, Arts and Sciences to the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences due to a donation of $200 million to the school made by Dana and David Dornsife. This gift is the largest in USC history.\nThe Graduate School.\nAll Ph.D. degrees awarded at USC and most master's degrees are under the jurisdiction of the Graduate School.\nProfessional schools.\nProfessional degrees are awarded by each of the 17 professional schools.\nIovine and Young Academy.\nThe Iovine and Young is USC's 20th and newest professional school. The program seeks to empower the next generation of thought leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs through the intersection of arts and design; technology; venture management; and communication.\nGlorya Kaufman School of Dance.\nIt was announced in 2012 that the School of Dance would be opened on campus; it is expected to open in fall of 2015.\nHerman Ostrow School of Dentistry.\nThe Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry is composed of seven divisions, including the Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy and the Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy.\nRoski School of Art and Design.\nIn 2006, The USC School of Fine Arts was renamed in honor of Gayle Roski, the wife of billionaire developer &lt;a href=\"Edward%20P.%20Roski\"&gt;Edward P. Roski&lt;/a&gt;, after a $23-million donation to the school. Both are USC alums.\nSchool of Pharmacy.\nFounded in 1905, the &lt;a href=\"USC%20School%20of%20Pharmacy\"&gt;USC School of Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt; has played a key leadership role in both the advancement of the field of pharmacy and in the education of new generations of pharmacists, and remains one of the nation's foremost schools of pharmacy today.\nUSC developed the nation's first Doctor of Pharmacy degree (PharmD) in 1950 and it was among the first schools of pharmacy to establish a clinical curriculum, beginning in 1968. Those were radical advances at the time but are now considered foundational training for all pharmacists throughout the US. The School also helped transform the pharmacist's role from a traditional dispenser of medicines to a direct provider of patient care. USC led a key pilot project in the 1970s to explore prescriptive authority for pharmacists that, in 1981, led to California being the first state to enact legislation allowing pharmacists to prescribe drug therapy in collaboration with physicians. USC then played a key role in the successful legislation in California that recognized pharmacists as healthcare providers in 2014.\nConsistently the top-ranked private school of pharmacy, the School continues to be an innovative force in pharmacy education to meet the needs of a changing world, launching the nation's first PharmD/MBA dual degree in 1990, the first PhD in pharmaceutical economics and policy in 1994, the first professional doctorate in regulatory science in 2008, and a translational science graduate program that merges science with clinical expertise.\nUSC is the only private school of pharmacy on a major health sciences campus. This affords its students a unique environment of professionalism and opens the doors for clinical opportunities immediately on campus, including those at the Keck Hospital of USC, USC Norris Cancer Hospital, and the four pharmacies owned and operated by the School. USC School of Pharmacy students also find a rich professional and social atmosphere on the Health Sciences Campus, interacting with colleagues and faculty from various health profession schools.\nSol Price School of Public Policy.\nThe mission of the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy is to improve the quality of life for people and their communities, in Southern California and abroad. It offers five master's level programs: Public Policy, Public Administration, Urban Planning, Real Estate Development, and Health Policy and Management. Graduate students at USC Price have considerable latitude to pursue their specialized areas of interest. Undergraduates pursue a more general Bachelor of Science in Public Policy, Management, and Planning/ For mid-career professionals, USC Price offers the Executive Master of Health Administration, the Executive Master of Leadership, and the International Public Policy and Management program.\nSuzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work.\nThe mission of the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work is to promote social justice and well-being at every social level through advanced education, community engagement, interdisciplinary scientific activity, advocacy, and professional leadership.\nThe school advances its mission through its three academic centers, each of which reflects all of the components of the school's rich learning environment, with opportunities for value-driven education, student and faculty scholarship, and opportunities for alumni to engage in lifelong learning. Faculty engage in empirical research, innovation and community service, engage our students in scholarly projects, and produce publications, conferences and presentations that focus on needs of vulnerable individuals and communities facing complex challenges in diverse environments. This is the first school of Social Work established west of the Mississippi.\nIn September 2016, Suzanne Dworak-Peck, BA \u201965, MSW \u201967, made a historic $60 million gift to endow and name the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work that will allow the school to broaden its vision and mission. This is the largest single gift to a school of Social Work in the United States.\nSchool of Cinematic Arts.\nThe School of Cinematic Arts, the first film school in the country and perhaps USC's most famous school, confers degrees in critical studies, screenwriting, film production, interactive media, animation, and film producing. As the university administration considered cinematic skills too valuable to be kept to film industry professionals, the school opened its classes to the university at large in 1998. In 2001, the film school added an &lt;a href=\"USC%20Interactive%20Media%20Division\"&gt;Interactive Media Division&lt;/a&gt; studying stereoscopic cinema, panoramic cinema, immersive cinema, interactive cinema, video games, virtual reality, and &lt;a href=\"mobile%20phone\"&gt;mobile&lt;/a&gt; media. In September 2006, George Lucas had donated $175 million to expand the film school, the largest single donation to USC (and its fifth over $100 million).\nSchool of Architecture.\nThe Department of Architecture was established at USC within the Roski School of Fine Arts in 1916, becoming the first of its kind in &lt;a href=\"Southern%20California\"&gt;Southern California&lt;/a&gt;. The department grew rapidly with the help of the Allied Architects of Los Angeles. A separate School of Architecture was organized in September 1925. Since then, the school has been home to teachers such as &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Neutra\"&gt;Richard Neutra&lt;/a&gt;, Ralph Knowles, &lt;a href=\"A.%20Quincy%20Jones\"&gt;A. Quincy Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"William%20Pereira\"&gt;William Pereira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Koenig\"&gt;Pierre Koenig&lt;/a&gt;. The School of Architecture can also claim notable alumni &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Gehry\"&gt;Frank Gehry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thom%20Mayne\"&gt;Thom Mayne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raphael%20Soriano\"&gt;Raphael Soriano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gregory%20Ain\"&gt;Gregory Ain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pierre%20Koenig\"&gt;Pierre Koenig&lt;/a&gt;. Two of the alumni have become &lt;a href=\"Pritzker%20Prize\"&gt;Pritzker Prize&lt;/a&gt; winners. In 2006, Qingyun Ma, a distinguished Shanghai-based architect, was named dean of the school.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx%3FarticleID%3D41\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nIn addition, in its 2009 edition of \"America's Best Architecture &amp; Design School\", the journal \"DesignIntelligence\" ranked USC School of Architecture as the 12th best undergraduate architecture school in the U.S.\nViterbi School of Engineering.\nThe Andrew and Erna Viterbi School of Engineering is headed by Dean Yannis Yortsos. Its research centers have played a major role in development of multiple technologies, including early development of the &lt;a href=\"Internet\"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; when USC researcher &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Postel\"&gt;Jonathan Postel&lt;/a&gt; was an editor of communications-protocol for the fledgling internet, also known as &lt;a href=\"ARPANET\"&gt;ARPANET&lt;/a&gt;. The school's faculty includes &lt;a href=\"Seymour%20Ginsburg\"&gt;Seymour Ginsburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Irving%20S.%20Reed\"&gt;Irving Reed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leonard%20Adleman\"&gt;Leonard Adleman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Solomon%20W.%20Golomb\"&gt;Solomon W.
