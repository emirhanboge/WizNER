    "title": "Rybachy Peninsula",
    "text": "Rybachy Peninsula (, \"poluostrov Rybachiy\"; ; ; ) is the northernmost part of continental &lt;a href=\"European%20Russia\"&gt;European Russia&lt;/a&gt;. Its name is translated as \"Fisher Peninsula\". It is connected with the &lt;a href=\"Sredny%20Peninsula\"&gt;Sredny Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, \"Middle Peninsula\" by a thin &lt;a href=\"isthmus\"&gt;isthmus&lt;/a&gt;. So the peninsula is in fact nearly completely surrounded by water. Administratively, it is included into &lt;a href=\"Pechengsky%20District\"&gt;Pechengsky District&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Murmansk%20Oblast\"&gt;Murmansk Oblast&lt;/a&gt; and is within several hours of ride from &lt;a href=\"Murmansk\"&gt;Murmansk&lt;/a&gt;.\nMain occupations of the population are &lt;a href=\"reindeer\"&gt;reindeer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"herding\"&gt;herding&lt;/a&gt; and (since 2003) &lt;a href=\"petroleum\"&gt;petroleum&lt;/a&gt; drilling.\nHistory.\nThe peninsula lies in an area where borders were marked relatively late; the Norwegian-Russian border was drawn in 1826, leaving Rybachy on the Russian side of the border. At the time, several Norwegian settlers lived on the peninsula.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Revolution%20%281917%29\"&gt;Russian Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, the western parts of Sredny and Rybachy were ceded to Finland. After the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20War\"&gt;Winter War&lt;/a&gt; of 1939\u20131940, Finland ceded them to the Soviet Union by the &lt;a href=\"Moscow%20Peace%20Treaty\"&gt;Moscow Peace Treaty&lt;/a&gt;. The Norwegian settlers became \"trapped\" in Soviet Russia after the revolution; some of their descendants were allowed Norwegian citizenship after &lt;a href=\"revolutions%20of%201989\"&gt;the fall of the Iron Curtain&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; for three years it was an arena of a positional war between Germans and Soviets. The peninsula covered the access to Murmansk and &lt;a href=\"Arkhangelsk\"&gt;Arkhangelsk&lt;/a&gt;, which were the main gates for the &lt;a href=\"Lend-Lease\"&gt;Lend-Lease&lt;/a&gt;. The front split the peninsula in two parts, both sides having heavily fortified positions.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;dissolution of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; the territory was heavily militarized because of the immediate vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Norway\"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; member. Now the military is removed, but in 2005 the territory was still closed to foreigners."
