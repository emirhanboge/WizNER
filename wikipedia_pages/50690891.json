    "text": "Goito was a &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20cruiser\"&gt;torpedo cruiser&lt;/a&gt; built for the Italian \"&lt;a href=\"Regia%20Marina\"&gt;Regia Marina&lt;/a&gt;\" (Royal Navy) in the 1880s. She was the &lt;a href=\"lead%20ship\"&gt;lead ship&lt;/a&gt; of the , which included three other vessels. \"Goito\" was built by the &lt;a href=\"Regio%20Cantiere%20di%20Castellammare%20di%20Stabia\"&gt;Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia&lt;/a&gt; shipyard between September 1885 and February 1888. She was armed with a variety of light guns and five &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s, and was capable of a top speed of . The ship served the duration of her career in the main Italian fleet. Her early service was primarily occupied with training exercises; front-line duties ended in 1897 when she was converted into a &lt;a href=\"minelayer\"&gt;minelayer&lt;/a&gt;, though she continued to participate in fleet exercises. During &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20I\"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, \"Goito\" laid defensive minefields in the &lt;a href=\"Adriatic%20Sea\"&gt;Adriatic Sea&lt;/a&gt;. She was eventually sold for scrap in 1920 and &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\n\"Goito\" was &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;long overall&lt;/a&gt; and had a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of and an average &lt;a href=\"draft%20%28hull%29\"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of . She &lt;a href=\"displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; normally. Her propulsion system consisted of three &lt;a href=\"compound%20engine\"&gt;double-expansion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"steam%20engine\"&gt;steam engine&lt;/a&gt;s each driving a single &lt;a href=\"screw%20propeller\"&gt;screw propeller&lt;/a&gt;, with steam supplied by six coal-fired &lt;a href=\"locomotive%20boiler\"&gt;locomotive boiler&lt;/a&gt;s. Exact figures for the ship's performance have not survived, but the members of the \"Goito\" class could steam at a speed of about from . \"Goito\" had a cruising radius of at a speed of . She had a crew of between 105 and 121.\nThe primary armament for \"Goito\" was five &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s. She carried a light gun &lt;a href=\"battery%20%28artillery%29\"&gt;battery&lt;/a&gt; for defense against &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s. This consisted of five &lt;a href=\"QF%206-pounder%20Hotchkiss\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 40-&lt;a href=\"caliber%20%28artillery%29\"&gt;caliber&lt;/a&gt; guns, two 20-cal. guns, and three 37\u00a0mm revolving &lt;a href=\"Hotchkiss%20gun\"&gt;Hotchkiss gun&lt;/a&gt;s, all mounted singly. The ship was protected with an armored &lt;a href=\"deck%20%28ship%29\"&gt;deck&lt;/a&gt; that was thick.\nService history.\n\"Goito\" was built by the &lt;a href=\"Regio%20Cantiere%20di%20Castellammare%20di%20Stabia\"&gt;Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia&lt;/a&gt; shipyard; her &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; in September 1885 and her completed &lt;a href=\"hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"ship%20launching\"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; on 6 July 1887. She was completed on 16 February 1888 and &lt;a href=\"ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; into the fleet, the first member of her class to enter service. That year, she took part in the annual fleet maneuvers, along with five &lt;a href=\"ironclad%20warship\"&gt;ironclads&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"protected%20cruiser\"&gt;protected cruiser&lt;/a&gt;, the torpedo cruisers , , and , and numerous smaller vessels. The maneuvers consisted of close-order drills and a simulated attack on and defense of La Spezia. Later that year, the ship was present during a naval review held for the German Kaiser &lt;a href=\"Wilhelm%20II\"&gt;Wilhelm II&lt;/a&gt; during a visit to Italy.\nThe ship served in the 3rd Division of the Active Squadron during the 1893 fleet maneuvers, along with the ironclads and and four &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20boat\"&gt;torpedo boat&lt;/a&gt;s. During the maneuvers, which lasted from 6 August to 5 September, the ships of the Active Squadron simulated a French attack on the Italian fleet. The following year, the ship took part in the annual fleet maneuvers in the 1st Division of the Active Squadron, along with the &lt;a href=\"ironclad%20battleship\"&gt;ironclad battleship&lt;/a&gt; and the protected cruiser . That year, \"Goito\" had her coal-fired boilers replaced with oil-fired models, and her center engine and propeller shaft were removed. Her engines now produced for a top speed of .\nIn 1895, \"Goito\" was stationed in the 2nd Maritime Department, split between &lt;a href=\"Taranto\"&gt;Taranto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naples\"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;, along with most of the torpedo cruisers in the Italian fleet. These included her sister ships , , and , the eight s, and \"Tripoli\". \"Goito\" was converted into a &lt;a href=\"minelayer\"&gt;minelayer&lt;/a&gt; in 1897. Her torpedo tubes were removed and equipment to handle sixty &lt;a href=\"naval%20mine\"&gt;naval mine&lt;/a&gt;s was installed. In 1898, \"Goito\" was assigned to the Reserve Squadron, which included the ironclads , , and , and three protected cruisers. The following year, she returned to the Active Squadron, where she served with six ironclads, the &lt;a href=\"armored%20cruiser\"&gt;armored cruiser&lt;/a&gt; , the protected cruiser , and . During the 1907 fleet maneuvers, \"Goito\" was attached to the main fleet to lay mines at a simulated advance base that would be created during the exercises.\nAt the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Italo-Turkish%20War\"&gt;Italo-Turkish War&lt;/a&gt; in September 1911, \"Goito\" was stationed in &lt;a href=\"Venice\"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt; along with \"Tripoli\" and \"Montebello\". None of the vessels saw action during the war. Italy had declared neutrality at the start of World War I, but by July 1915, the &lt;a href=\"Triple%20Entente\"&gt;Triple Entente&lt;/a&gt; had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Powers\"&gt;Central Powers&lt;/a&gt;. Admiral &lt;a href=\"Paolo%20Thaon%20di%20Revel\"&gt;Paolo Thaon di Revel&lt;/a&gt;, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Navy\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the &lt;a href=\"MAS%20%28boat%29\"&gt;MAS boats&lt;/a&gt;, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. \"Goito\" was initially used to lay a series of defensive minefields, along with the torpedo cruisers and , in support of this strategy. The ship remained in service until early 1920; she was stricken from the &lt;a href=\"naval%20register\"&gt;naval register&lt;/a&gt; on 15 March 1920 and subsequently &lt;a href=\"ship%20breaking\"&gt;broken up&lt;/a&gt; for scrap."
