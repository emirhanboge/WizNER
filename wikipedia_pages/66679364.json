    "text": "The Capri 16, also called the Catalina 16, is an American &lt;a href=\"Trailer%20sailer\"&gt;trailerable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt; that was designed by &lt;a href=\"Frank%20W.%20Butler\"&gt;Frank W. Butler&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"pocket%20cruiser\"&gt;pocket cruiser&lt;/a&gt; and first built in 1987.\nProduction.\nThe design was built by &lt;a href=\"Catalina%20Yachts\"&gt;Catalina Yachts&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; from 1987 to 2005 with 500 boats completed, but it is now out of production.\nDesign.\nThe Capri 16 is a recreational &lt;a href=\"keelboat\"&gt;keelboat&lt;/a&gt;, built predominantly of &lt;a href=\"fiberglass\"&gt;fiberglass&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"teak\"&gt;teak&lt;/a&gt; wood trim. It has a &lt;a href=\"Fractional%20rig\"&gt;fractional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sloop\"&gt;sloop&lt;/a&gt; rig, a &lt;a href=\"raked%20stem\"&gt;raked stem&lt;/a&gt;, a plumb &lt;a href=\"Transom%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;transom&lt;/a&gt;, a transom-hung &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; controlled by a &lt;a href=\"tiller\"&gt;tiller&lt;/a&gt; and a fixed &lt;a href=\"wing%20keel\"&gt;wing keel&lt;/a&gt;. It displaces and carries of ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of with the standard wing keel.\nThe boat is normally fitted with a small &lt;a href=\"outboard%20motor\"&gt;outboard motor&lt;/a&gt; for docking and maneuvering.\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for two people, with two long, straight settees in the main cabin. There is a space for an &lt;a href=\"ice%20box\"&gt;ice box&lt;/a&gt; and stowage in the forepeak. The &lt;a href=\"Head%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; is a portable type, located just aft of the &lt;a href=\"companionway\"&gt;companionway&lt;/a&gt; ladder. Cabin headroom is .\nThe design has a &lt;a href=\"hull%20speed\"&gt;hull speed&lt;/a&gt; of .\nOperational history.\nIn a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, \"as sailboats of this size go, the cockpit is larger and the cabin is smaller than average. The 425-pound wing keel is intended to combine shallow (2' 5\") draft for gunkholing with reasonable windward performance\u2014although this puts draft near the upper limit for convenient trailering. This might make a good first boat for a young couple. Best features: ... Construction is simple but neat, and adequate for this size and type of craft. The boat seems well designed and the sailplan looks manageable and efficient, though perhaps on the small side for really spritely performance. Worst features: Compared with her comp[etitor]s, the Capri 16 has ... less headroom (though her storage space below is about at the average of her comp[etitor]s). On the other hand, after all, she\u2019s only intended to be a weekender; and her two berths are long enough for the tallest sailors.\""
