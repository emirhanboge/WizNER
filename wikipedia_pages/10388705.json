    "title": "Philosophy of Max Stirner",
    "text": "The philosophy of Max Stirner is credited as a major influence in the development of &lt;a href=\"individualism\"&gt;individualism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nihilism\"&gt;nihilism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"existentialism\"&gt;existentialism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"post-modernism\"&gt;post-modernism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anarchism\"&gt;anarchism&lt;/a&gt; (especially of &lt;a href=\"egoist%20anarchism\"&gt;egoist anarchism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"individualist%20anarchism\"&gt;individualist anarchism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"postanarchism\"&gt;postanarchism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"post-left%20anarchy\"&gt;post-left anarchy&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Max%20Stirner\"&gt;Max Stirner&lt;/a&gt;'s main philosophical work was \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ego%20and%20Its%20Own\"&gt;The Ego and Its Own&lt;/a&gt;\", also known as \"The Ego and His Own\" (\"Der Einzige und sein Eigentum\" in German, or more accurately \"The Individual and its Property\"). Stirner's philosophy has been cited as an influence on both his contemporaries, most notably &lt;a href=\"Karl%20Marx\"&gt;Karl Marx&lt;/a&gt; (who was strongly opposed to Stirner's views) as well as subsequent thinkers such as &lt;a href=\"Friedrich%20Nietzsche\"&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enrico%20Arrigoni\"&gt;Enrico Arrigoni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steven%20T.%20Byington\"&gt;Steven T. Byington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Tucker\"&gt;Benjamin Tucker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%C3%89mile%20Armand\"&gt;\u00c9mile Armand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Albert%20Camus\"&gt;Albert Camus&lt;/a&gt;\nThought.\nSelf.\nStirner argues that the concept of the self is something impossible to fully comprehend; a so-called \"creative nothing\" he described as an \"end-point of language.\" Stirner elaborated this attempt to describe the indescribable in the essay \"Stirner's Critics\", written by Stirner in response to Feuerbach and others (in the custom of the time, he refers to himself in the third person): \nIn order to understand this creative nothing, Stirner uses poetry and vivid imagery. The creative nothing by its dialectical shortcomings creates the need for a description, for meaning: \n\"The Ego and Its Own\" opens and closes with a quotation from &lt;a href=\"Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe\"&gt;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&lt;/a&gt; that reads \"I have taken up my cause without foundation\", with the unstated next line of the poem being \"and all the world is mine\". One of Stirner's central ideas is that in realizing the self is \"nothing\" one is said to \"own the world\" because\u2014as the book states in its last line\u2014\"all things are nothing to me\" [\"Ibidem\", p. 324]: \nStirner describes this world view in brief as \"enjoyment\" and claims that the \"nothingness\" of the non-self is \"unutterable\" (p. 314) or \"unnameable\" (p. 132), \"unspeakable\" yet \"a mere word\" (p. 164; cf. Stirner's comments on the skeptic concepts &lt;a href=\"ataraxia\"&gt;ataraxia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aphasia\"&gt;aphasia&lt;/a&gt;, p. 26).\nEgoism.\nStirner has been broadly understood as a proponent of both &lt;a href=\"psychological%20egoism\"&gt;psychological egoism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ethical%20egoism\"&gt;ethical egoism&lt;/a&gt;, although the latter position can be disputed as there is no claim in Stirner's writing in which one ought to pursue one's own interest and further claiming any \"ought\" could be seen as a new \"fixed idea\". Therefore, he may be understood as a &lt;a href=\"rational%20egoist\"&gt;rational egoist&lt;/a&gt; in the sense that he considered it irrational not to act in one's self-interest. However, how this self-interest is defined is necessarily subjective, allowing both selfish and altruistic normative claims to be included. Further, rationality as an end in and of itself is another fixed idea.\nIndividual self-realization rests on each individual's desire to fulfill their &lt;a href=\"Egoist%20anarchism\"&gt;egoism&lt;/a&gt;. The difference between an unwilling and a willing egoist is that the former will be 'possessed' by an empty idea and believe that they are fulfilling a higher cause, but usually being unaware that they are only fulfilling their own desires to be happy or secure; and the latter, in contrast, will be a person that is able to freely choose its actions, fully aware that they are only fulfilling individual desires: \nThe contrast is also expressed in terms of the difference between the voluntary egoist being the possessor of his concepts as opposed to being possessed. Only when one realizes that all sacred truths such as &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rights\"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"morality\"&gt;morality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; and so on are nothing other than artificial concepts and not to be obeyed can one act freely. For Stirner, to be free is to be both one's own \"creature\" (in the sense of 'creation') and one's own \"creator\" (dislocating the traditional role assigned to the gods). To Stirner, power is the method of egoism. It is the only justified method of gaining '&lt;a href=\"property\"&gt;property&lt;/a&gt;'. Even &lt;a href=\"love\"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; is explained as \"consciously egoistic\": \nHowever, Stirner cautioned against any &lt;a href=\"Reification%20%28fallacy%29\"&gt;reification&lt;/a&gt; of the egoist or subject: \nAnarchism.\nStirner proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions\u2014including the notion of state, property as a right, &lt;a href=\"natural%20rights\"&gt;natural rights&lt;/a&gt; in general and the very notion of society\u2014were mere illusions - spooks, or \"ghosts\" in the mind, saying of society that \"the individuals are its reality\". Stirner wants to \"abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members\".\nHe advocated egoism and a form of &lt;a href=\"amoralism\"&gt;amoralism&lt;/a&gt; in which individuals would unite in a \"&lt;a href=\"Union%20of%20egoists\"&gt;Union of egoists&lt;/a&gt;\" only when it was in their self-interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might: \"Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. [...] \"What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing\". He says: \"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!\". Stirner considers the world and everything in it, including other persons, available to one's taking or use without moral constraint\u2014that rights do not exist in regard to objects and people at all. He sees no rationality in taking the interests of others into account unless doing so furthers one's self-interest, which he believes is the only legitimate reason for acting. He denies society as being an actual entity: \"The conquerors form a society which one may imagine so great that it by degrees embraces all humanity; but so-called humanity too is as such only a thought (spook); the individuals are its reality\" (\"The Ego and Its Own\", Tucker ed., p. 329).\nStirner never referred to markets and his philosophy on property causes problems for a market system because\u2014according to proponents of markets\u2014property is not considered to be legitimate if taken by force. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual. He said in \"The Ego and Its Own\": \nProperty.\nStirner has a concept of \"egoistic property\" in which he is referring to the absence of moral restrictions on how the individual uses everything in the world, including other people. For Stirner, property comes about through might: \"Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. [...] What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing\". He says: \"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!\". This position on property is much different from the then prevalent form of individualist anarchism, which defended the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labour. However, &lt;a href=\"American%20individualist%20anarchist\"&gt;American individualist anarchist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Tucker\"&gt;Benjamin Tucker&lt;/a&gt; rejected the &lt;a href=\"natural%20rights\"&gt;natural rights&lt;/a&gt; philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism in 1886, with several others joining with him. Since he was a radical anarchist, he preferred a political-economic social condition that was anti-statist, anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian completely void of authoritarian monopolies (whether they positioned themselves as property or sovereignty) which were the enemies of individual liberation. Stirner's egoist anarchism is all about freeing the individual from the domination of property monopolists such as monarchs, governments, or industrialists while at the same time it positions itself against the anti-individualist nature of the traditional political left. Stirner had no concrete dogma on the issue of property and simply urged individuals to stop being ruled by others regardless of the authorities' moral claims about political sovereignty or property rights.\nUnion of egoists.\nStirner's idea of the \"Union of egoists\" was first expounded in \"The Ego and Its Own\". The Union is understood as a non-systematic association, which Stirner proposed in contradistinction to the &lt;a href=\"Sovereign%20state\"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;. The Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will. The Union requires that all parties participate out of a &lt;a href=\"Selfishness\"&gt;conscious egoism&lt;/a&gt;. If one party silently finds themselves to be suffering, but puts up and keeps the appearance, the union has degenerated into something else. This Union is not seen as an &lt;a href=\"authority\"&gt;authority&lt;/a&gt; above a person's own will.\nRevolution.\nStirner criticizes conventional notions of &lt;a href=\"revolution\"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that &lt;a href=\"social%20movement\"&gt;social movement&lt;/a&gt;s aimed at overturning the state are tacitly statist because they are implicitly aimed at the establishment of a new state thereafter. To illustrate this argument, he compares his own social and moral role with that of &lt;a href=\"Jesus%20Christ\"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;: \nAs Stirner specifies in a footnote (p. 280), he was here using the word &lt;a href=\"Insurgency\"&gt;insurgent&lt;/a&gt; \"in its &lt;a href=\"etymological\"&gt;etymological&lt;/a&gt; sense\", therefore to rise above the religion and government of one's own times and to take control of one's life with no consideration of them, but not necessarily to overthrow them. This contrasts with the method of the revolutionary who brings about a change of conditions by displacing one government with another: \nDogma.\nThe passages quoted above show the few points of contact between Stirner's philosophy and &lt;a href=\"early%20Christianity\"&gt;early Christianity&lt;/a&gt;. It is merely Jesus as an \"annihilator\" of the established biases and preconceptions of Rome that Stirner can relate to. His reason for \"citing\" the cultural change sparked by Jesus is that he wants the Christian ideologies of 19th century Europe to collapse, much as the ideology of heathen Rome did before it (e.g. \"[the Christian era] will end with the casting off of the ideal, with 'contempt for the spirit'\", p. 320). As with the &lt;a href=\"Skepticism\"&gt;classical skeptics&lt;/a&gt; before him, Stirner's method of self-liberation is opposed to faith or belief and he envisions a life free from \"dogmatic presuppositions\" (p. 135, 309) or any \"fixed standpoint\" (p. 295). It is not merely Christian &lt;a href=\"dogma\"&gt;dogma&lt;/a&gt; that his thought repudiates, but also a wide variety of European atheist ideologies that are condemned as &lt;a href=\"Crypto-Christianity\"&gt;crypto-Christian&lt;/a&gt; for putting ideas in an equivalent role: \nWhat Stirner proposes is not that concepts should rule people, but that people should rule concepts. The \"nothingness\" of all truth is rooted in the \"nothingness\" of the self because the ego is the criterion of (dogmatic) truth. Again, Stirner seems closely comparable to the skeptics in that his radical &lt;a href=\"epistemology\"&gt;epistemology&lt;/a&gt; directs us to emphasise &lt;a href=\"empirical\"&gt;empirical&lt;/a&gt; experience (the \"unmediated\" relationship of mind as world and world as mind), but it leaves only a very limited validity to the category of \"truth\". When we regard the impressions of the senses with detachment, simply for what they are (e.g. neither good nor evil), we may still correctly assign truth to them: \nIn place of such systems of beliefs, Stirner presents a detached life of non-dogmatic, open-minded engagement with the world \"as it is\" (unpolluted by \"faith\" of any kind, Christian or humanist), coupled with the awareness that there is no soul, no personal essence of any kind, but that the individual's uniqueness consists solely in its \"creative nothingness\" prior to all concepts.\nHegel's possible influence.\nScholar Lawrence Stepelevich argues that &lt;a href=\"Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel\"&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&lt;/a&gt; was a major influence on \"The Ego and Its Own\". While the latter has an \"un-Hegelian structure and tone\" on the whole and is hostile to Hegel's conclusions about the self and the world, Stepelevich argues that Stirner's work is best understood as answering Hegel's question of the role of consciousness after it has contemplated \"untrue knowledge\" and become \"absolute knowledge\". Stirner, Stepelevich concludes, presents the consequences of the rediscovering one's self-consciousness after realizing self-determination.\nHowever, Widukind De Ridder has argued that scholars who take Stirner's references to Hegel and the &lt;a href=\"Young%20Hegelians\"&gt;Young Hegelians&lt;/a&gt; as expressions of his own alleged &lt;a href=\"Hegelianism\"&gt;Hegelianism&lt;/a&gt; are highly mistaken. De Ridder argues that \"The Ego and Its Own\" is in part a carefully constructed parody of Hegelianism, deliberately exposing its outwornness as a system of thought; and that Stirner's notions of \"ownness\" and \"egoism\" were part of his radical criticism of the implicit teleology of Hegelian dialectics.\nInfluence.\nStirner was a philosopher whose \"name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism\". In 1844, his \"The Ego and Its Own\" (\"Der Einzige und sein Eigentum\" which may literally be translated as \"The Unique Individual and Its Property\") was published and it is considered to be \"a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism\".\nFor the Polish political philosopher and &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20ideas\"&gt;historian of ideas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Leszek%20Ko%C5%82akowski\"&gt;Leszek Ko\u0142akowski&lt;/a&gt;, there is logical explanation for the interest of the early intellectuals of &lt;a href=\"fascism\"&gt;fascism&lt;/a&gt; and proto-fascism in the individualist/egoist ideas of Stirner.
