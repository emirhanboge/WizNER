However, the family's quality of life degraded after the &lt;a href=\"communist\"&gt;communist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"1948%20Czechoslovak%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;.

Furthermore, he was involved in the foundation of the theatre Divadlo Waterloo (\"Waterloo Theatre\") and wrote the music for the musical \"Syn Pluku\" (op. 3) (\"Son of the Regiment\") in 1968.

Schiffauer was expelled from the Academy of Performing Arts and sentenced to nine months of imprisonment as a result of having composed for \"Syn Pluku\". He served his sentence in the prison in &lt;a href=\"Plze%C5%88\"&gt;Pilsen&lt;/a&gt;-Bory, wherein he wrote the children's opera \"Vrat' n\u00e1m, pt\u00e1ku, Hastermana!\" (\"Bring us Hasterman back, Bird!\") with the author Ivan Binar, his friend and later &lt;a href=\"Charter%2077\"&gt;Charter 77&lt;/a&gt; signatory. , Schiffauer was employed as a worker and was being permanently interrogated by the State Security Police throughout the normalization era.
