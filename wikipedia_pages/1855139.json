It was a crime drama about a man whose married lover persuades him to commit a robbery; Tryon was second billed. He was top billed in a low budget war film at Allied Artists, \"&lt;a href=\"Screaming%20Eagles%20%28film%29\"&gt;Screaming Eagles&lt;/a&gt;\" (1956), then supported &lt;a href=\"Charlton%20Heston\"&gt;Charlton Heston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anne%20Baxter\"&gt;Anne Baxter&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Three%20Violent%20People\"&gt;Three Violent People&lt;/a&gt;\" (1956) at Paramount.

The role was based on actual historical figure &lt;a href=\"John%20Horton%20Slaughter\"&gt;John Slaughter&lt;/a&gt;. He was considered but eventually passed over for the role of &lt;a href=\"Janet%20Leigh\"&gt;Janet Leigh&lt;/a&gt;'s lover, Sam Loomis, in the classic thriller \"&lt;a href=\"Psycho%20%281960%20film%29\"&gt;Psycho&lt;/a&gt;\" (1960); the role went to &lt;a href=\"John%20Gavin\"&gt;John Gavin&lt;/a&gt;.\n20th Century Fox.\nTryon starred in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Story%20of%20Ruth\"&gt;The Story of Ruth&lt;/a&gt;\" (1960) at 20th Century Fox. For that studio he appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Marines%2C%20Let%27s%20Go\"&gt;Marines, Let's Go&lt;/a&gt;\" (1961). Disney borrowed him to star in a satire about the space age, \"&lt;a href=\"Moon%20Pilot\"&gt;Moon Pilot&lt;/a&gt;\" (1962). He was one of many names in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Longest%20Day%20%28film%29\"&gt;The Longest Day&lt;/a&gt;\" (1962) at Fox. In 1962, Tryon was cast to play the role of Stephen Burkett (\"Adam\") in the unfinished &lt;a href=\"Marilyn%20Monroe\"&gt;Marilyn Monroe&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Dean%20Martin\"&gt;Dean Martin&lt;/a&gt; comedy film, \"&lt;a href=\"Something%27s%20Got%20to%20Give\"&gt;Something's Got to Give&lt;/a&gt;\", directed by &lt;a href=\"George%20Cukor\"&gt;George Cukor&lt;/a&gt;, but lost that role after Monroe was fired from the movie. He guest starred on \"&lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Kildare%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;Dr. Kildare&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Virginian%20%28TV%20series%29\"&gt;The Virginian&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOtto Preminger.\nTryon's greatest role was as an ambitious Catholic priest in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cardinal\"&gt;The Cardinal&lt;/a&gt;\" (1963). The film was a box office hit and Tryon received a nomination for a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Drama\"&gt;Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama&lt;/a&gt;. However, that honor barely compensated for the trauma and abuse he suffered at the hands of director &lt;a href=\"Otto%20Preminger\"&gt;Otto Preminger&lt;/a&gt;. At one point during filming, Preminger fired Tryon in front of his parents when they visited the set, then rehired him after being satisfied that Tryon had been sufficiently humiliated.\n\"Finally, I was in a position of being able to pick my roles,\" said Tryon in 1986. \"But I didn't like the movie. I didn't like me in the movie. To this day, I cannot look at that film. It's because of Preminger. He was a tyrant who ruled by terror. He tied me up in knots. He screamed at me. He called me names. He said I was lazy. He said I was a fool. He never cursed me. His insults were far more personal.\"\nTryon guest-starred on \"&lt;a href=\"Kraft%20Suspense%20Theatre\"&gt;Kraft Suspense Theatre&lt;/a&gt;\" and then was reunited with Preminger in \"&lt;a href=\"In%20Harm%27s%20Way\"&gt;In Harm's Way&lt;/a&gt;\" (1965).\nHe had the lead in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Glory%20Guys\"&gt;The Glory Guys&lt;/a&gt;\" (1965).\nLater acting career.\nHe was part of a live television performance of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Usher\"&gt;The Fall of the House of Usher&lt;/a&gt;\". He also co-wrote a song, \"I Wish I Was\", which appeared on an obscure record by &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Kallman\"&gt;Dick Kallman&lt;/a&gt;, star of the short-lived 1965 television &lt;a href=\"sitcom\"&gt;sitcom&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Hank%20%281965%20TV%20series%29\"&gt;Hank&lt;/a&gt;\". Other television roles include episodes of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Valley\"&gt;The Big Valley&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Bob%20Hope%20Presents%20the%20Chrysler%20Theatre\"&gt;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&lt;/a&gt;\", and the 1967 TV movie remake \"&lt;a href=\"Winchester%20%2773%23Remake\"&gt;Winchester '73&lt;/a&gt;\". Tryon went to Australia to make \"&lt;a href=\"Color%20Me%20Dead\"&gt;Color Me Dead&lt;/a&gt;\" (1969).\nWriting career.\nDisillusioned with acting, Tryon retired from the profession in 1969 and began writing &lt;a href=\"horror%20fiction\"&gt;horror&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mystery%20%28fiction%29\"&gt;mystery&lt;/a&gt; novels. He was successful, overcoming skepticism about a classically handsome movie star suddenly turning novelist. He also moved into film financing, being executive producer on \"&lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Got%20His%20Gun%20%28film%29\"&gt;Johnny Got His Gun&lt;/a&gt;\" (1971).\nHis best-known work is \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Other%20%28Tryon%20novel%29\"&gt;The Other&lt;/a&gt;\" (1971), about a boy whose evil twin brother may or may not be responsible for a series of deaths in a small rural community in the 1930s. He adapted his novel into &lt;a href=\"The%20Other%20%281972%20film%29\"&gt;a film&lt;/a&gt; released the following year that starred &lt;a href=\"Diana%20Muldaur\"&gt;Diana Muldaur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uta%20Hagen\"&gt;Uta Hagen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"John%20Ritter\"&gt;John Ritter&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Harvest%20Home%20%28novel%29\"&gt;Harvest Home&lt;/a&gt;\" (1973), about the dark &lt;a href=\"paganism\"&gt;pagan&lt;/a&gt; rituals being practiced in a small &lt;a href=\"New%20England\"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; town, was adapted as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Secret%20of%20Harvest%20Home\"&gt;The Dark Secret of Harvest Home&lt;/a&gt;\" (1978), a television miniseries starring &lt;a href=\"Bette%20Davis\"&gt;Bette Davis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn extensive critical analysis of Tryon's horror novels can be found in &lt;a href=\"S.%20T.%20Joshi\"&gt;S. T. Joshi&lt;/a&gt;'s book \"The Modern Weird Tale\" (2001). His other books include \"Crowned Heads\", a collection of &lt;a href=\"novella\"&gt;novella&lt;/a&gt;s inspired by the legends of &lt;a href=\"Hollywood\"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;. Tryon sold the film rights to Universal to make four films based on the novellas. The first of these novellas, \"&lt;a href=\"Fedora%20%281978%20film%29\"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;,\" about a reclusive former film actress whose relationship with her plastic surgeon is similar to that between a drug addict and her pusher, was later converted to a feature film directed by &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Wilder\"&gt;Billy Wilder&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther novellas in the collection were based on the murder of former silent screen star &lt;a href=\"Ram%C3%B3n%20Novarro\"&gt;Ram\u00f3n Novarro&lt;/a&gt; and on the quasi-Oedipal relationship between actor &lt;a href=\"Clifton%20Webb\"&gt;Clifton Webb&lt;/a&gt; and his mother. \"Lady\" (1974) concerns the friendship between an eight-year-old boy and a charming widow in 1930s New England and the secret he discovers about her. His novel \"The Night of the Moonbow\" (1989) tells the story of a boy driven to violent means by the constant harassment he receives at a boys summer camp. \"Night Magic,\" written in 1991, was posthumously published in 1995.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1955, Tryon married Ann L. Noyes, the daughter of stockbroker Joseph Leo Lilienthal and his wife, the former Edna Arnstein. She was the former wife of Thomas Ewing Noyes, with whom she had been a theatrical producer. The Tryons divorced in 1958, and Ann Tryon resumed her previous married name. She died in 1966. Tryon said that she committed suicide and that he kept a photograph of her in his apartment.\nDuring the 1970s, he was in a romantic relationship with Clive Clerk, one of the original cast members of \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Chorus%20Line\"&gt;A Chorus Line&lt;/a&gt;\" and an interior designer who decorated Tryon's apartment on &lt;a href=\"Central%20Park%20West\"&gt;Central Park West&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, which was featured in \"&lt;a href=\"Architectural%20Digest\"&gt;Architectural Digest&lt;/a&gt;\". From 1973 to 1977, Tryon was in a relationship with porn actor &lt;a href=\"Casey%20Donovan%20%28actor%29\"&gt;Casey Donovan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nTryon died on September 4, 1991, at the age of 65 in Los Angeles, California. The alleged cause of death was \"stomach cancer\", but Tryon's literary executor, C. Thomas Holloway, stated that Tryon's stomach cancer was caused by his being HIV-positive. Tryon asked to keep this private. When Tryon's lover Clive Clerk explained, \"Tom didn't want his readers or his relatives to know,\" Holloway disapproved, writing, \"I see it as Tom's selfish silence helped the Dark Ages continue into the millennium.\""
