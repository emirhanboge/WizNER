    "text": "Malaysian Federal Roads System (), is the main national road network in &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. All Federal Roads in Malaysia are under the purview of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Works%20%28Malaysia%29\"&gt;Ministry of Works&lt;/a&gt; (MOW). According to the &lt;a href=\"Ministerial%20Functions%20Act%201969\"&gt;Ministerial Functions Act 1969&lt;/a&gt;, the MOW is responsible to plan, build and maintain all Federal Roads gazetted under the Federal Roads Act 1959. However, most of the Federal roads' projects were built and maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20Public%20Works%20Department\"&gt;Malaysian Public Works Department&lt;/a&gt; (JKR), which is also one of the implementing agencies under the MOW (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Sabah\"&gt;Sabah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sarawak\"&gt;Sarawak&lt;/a&gt;, whereby JKR in these two states is under respective state government).\nHistory.\nMost of the federal roads in &lt;a href=\"Peninsular%20Malaysia\"&gt;Peninsular Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; were built during the &lt;a href=\"British%20Empire\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; colonial era before 1957. At that time, the British government built the roads in order to enable them to transport goods and commodities easier.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Sabah\"&gt;Sabah&lt;/a&gt;, most of the federal roads were built during the occupation of &lt;a href=\"British%20North%20Borneo\"&gt;British North Borneo&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"British%20North%20Borneo%20Company\"&gt;North Borneo Chartered Company&lt;/a&gt; administration, and unlike most federal roads in Peninsular Malaysia which uses only numbers to label federal roads, Sabah federal road codes begin with the letter A followed by route number.\nHowever, in &lt;a href=\"Sarawak\"&gt;Sarawak&lt;/a&gt;, no road network system was developed during the rule of &lt;a href=\"White%20Rajah\"&gt;White Rajah&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Raja%20Brooke\"&gt;Brooke&lt;/a&gt; dynasty. As a result, right after Sarawak joined the federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, the federal government of &lt;a href=\"Malaysia\"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; began to build a road network system connecting Sarawak to Sabah, known as &lt;a href=\"Pan%20Borneo%20Highway\"&gt;Pan Borneo Highway&lt;/a&gt;.\nFederal road standards.\nOverview.\nThe total length of federal roads is . (Grand Total for federal/state roads is 250,023km as of December 2019)\nFederal routes are labeled with only numbers, for example Federal Route 1, while state routes are labeled with the state code letter followed by assigned numbers; for example Route (J)32 is a &lt;a href=\"Johor\"&gt;Johor&lt;/a&gt; state road. However, federal route numbers can also be added with the\n\"FT-\" prefix, which is normally used by JKR and &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Malaysian%20Police\"&gt;Malaysian police&lt;/a&gt;. For example, Federal Route 1 can also be written as Federal Route FT1. Both federal and state roads have blue road signs and the text colour is white.\nMost of the federal roads in Malaysia are two-lane roads. Malaysia implements a right-hand driving system where drivers drive on the left side of the road. However, there are in certain places where additional lanes are available. In town areas, federal roads may become four-lane roads to increase traffic capacity. In hilly areas, additional third climbing lane is available for slower vehicles such as buses and lorries.\nSome federal roads may have &lt;a href=\"motorcycle%20lane\"&gt;motorcycle lane&lt;/a&gt;s. On Malaysian federal roads, the motorcycle lanes are placed at the extreme left side of each direction and only separated from the main lanes by black-and-white stripes to enable motorcyclists to overtake slower motorcycles and to turn right to exit the road.\nSome expressways in Malaysia such as &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Highway%2C%20Malaysia\"&gt;Federal Highway&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skudai%20Highway\"&gt;Skudai Highway&lt;/a&gt; are federally funded, therefore all federally funded expressways are also classified as federal roads.\nNearly all federal roads are paved with typical &lt;a href=\"Asphalt%20concrete\"&gt;tarmac&lt;/a&gt; except &lt;a href=\"Skudai-Pontian%20Highway\"&gt;Skudai-Pontian Highway&lt;/a&gt; which is paved with &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Universiti%20Teknologi%20Malaysia\"&gt;Universiti Teknologi Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; interchange to Taman Sri Pulai junction and &lt;a href=\"Federal%20route%205\"&gt;Sitiawan\u2013Batak Rabit road&lt;/a&gt; (Federal route 5) from &lt;a href=\"Sitiawan\"&gt;Sitiawan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kota%20Setia\"&gt;Kota Setia&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, at &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Highway%2C%20Malaysia\"&gt;Federal Highway&lt;/a&gt; linking Klang to Kuala Lumpur, the section of the highway from &lt;a href=\"Subang%20Jaya\"&gt;Subang Jaya&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kota%20Darul%20Ehsan\"&gt;Kota Darul Ehsan&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Petaling%20Jaya\"&gt;Petaling Jaya&lt;/a&gt; are paved with &lt;a href=\"asphalt\"&gt;asphalt&lt;/a&gt;.\nSarawak has some of the most extensive federal road network in Malaysia. All federal roads in Sarawak is connecting main divisions with exception of &lt;a href=\"Mukah%20Division\"&gt;Mukah division&lt;/a&gt;. As for &lt;a href=\"Kapit%20Division\"&gt;Kapit division&lt;/a&gt;, the only federal road serving this division is Jalan Bakun (starting from KM 95\u2013KM 120). Coastal road of Bintulu\u2013Miri is a still in dispute between federal government and state government right of maintenance. It is due to the construction is federal funded, but the compensation and acquisition of land are from Sarawak state government. No federal roads are isolated from the network unlike state roads. Uniquely in Sarawak, federal road network is adjoined internationally to Brunei highway at &lt;a href=\"Sungai%20Tujuh\"&gt;Sungai Tujuh&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Miri%2C%20Malaysia\"&gt;Miri&lt;/a&gt;) with &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Belait\"&gt;Kuala Belait&lt;/a&gt; (Brunei), &lt;a href=\"Tedungan\"&gt;Tedungan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Limbang\"&gt;Limbang&lt;/a&gt;) with &lt;a href=\"Kuala%20Lurah\"&gt;Kuala Lurah&lt;/a&gt; (Brunei), Limbang with Puni (Brunei), &lt;a href=\"Lawas\"&gt;Lawas&lt;/a&gt; with Labu (Brunei) and also to Indonesian road network at &lt;a href=\"Tebedu\"&gt;Tebedu&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Serian%2C%20Sarawak\"&gt;Serian&lt;/a&gt; district) with &lt;a href=\"Entikong\"&gt;Entikong&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kalimantan%20Barat\"&gt;Kalimantan Barat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indonesia\"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;).\nMalaysian federal roads are subject to the rural highway standard adopted by &lt;a href=\"Malaysian%20Public%20Works%20Department\"&gt;Malaysian Public Works Department&lt;/a&gt; (JKR), ranging from R1 and R1a (minor roads at villages and &lt;a href=\"FELDA\"&gt;FELDA&lt;/a&gt; settlements with no access control and low speed limits) to R5 (federal roads or highways with limited access control and speed limits up to 90\u00a0km/h). R6 standard is exclusive for high-speed (up to 110\u00a0km/h) &lt;a href=\"Controlled-access%20highway\"&gt;expressways&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"limited-access%20road\"&gt;full access&lt;/a&gt; control.\nType of federal roads and route number categories.\nMain federal roads.\nMostly found at &lt;a href=\"Peninsula%20Malaysia\"&gt;Peninsula Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabah\"&gt;Sabah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sarawak\"&gt;Sarawak&lt;/a&gt;.\nFELDA/FELCRA federal roads.\nMostly found at &lt;a href=\"FELDA\"&gt;FELDA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"FELCRA\"&gt;FELCRA&lt;/a&gt; settlements in &lt;a href=\"Peninsula%20Malaysia\"&gt;Peninsula Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; only.

In town areas, the speed limit is reduced to 60\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). &lt;a href=\"Speed%20trap\"&gt;Speed trap&lt;/a&gt;s are also deployed by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Malaysian%20Police\"&gt;Malaysian police&lt;/a&gt; at many places along the federal roads.\nAccidents.\nMalaysian federal roads are always sites of most of the road accidents in Malaysia, especially during festive seasons.\nDuring festive seasons.\nDuring festive seasons such as &lt;a href=\"Chinese%20New%20Year\"&gt;Chinese New Year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deepavali\"&gt;Deepavali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Christmas\"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hari%20Raya%20Aidilfitri\"&gt;Hari Raya Aidilfitri&lt;/a&gt;, activities such as construction, road repairs and maintenance works have been stopped.
