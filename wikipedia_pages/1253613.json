    "text": "Mario Aburto Mart\u00ednez (born 8 October 1971) is a Mexican man who was convicted for &lt;a href=\"assassination\"&gt;assassinating&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidate &lt;a href=\"Luis%20Donaldo%20Colosio\"&gt;Luis Donaldo Colosio&lt;/a&gt; in 1994. He confessed to the murder and was sentenced to 42 years in prison. Despite the confession and conviction, the \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Times\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;\" reported that there was widespread belief within Mexico that the conviction involved a conspiracy and coverup mainly by &lt;a href=\"Carlos%20Salinas%20de%20Gortari\"&gt;Carlos Salinas de Gortari&lt;/a&gt; (the president at that time) and &lt;a href=\"Manuel%20Camacho%20Sol%C3%ADs\"&gt;Manuel Camacho Sol\u00eds&lt;/a&gt; (a member of Salinas' &lt;a href=\"cabinet%20%28government%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt;). A later Mexican film called \"Colosio, el asesinato\" alleged that the Salinas government was behind the crime."
