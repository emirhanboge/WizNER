    "text": "The Kasei Valles are a giant system of &lt;a href=\"canyon\"&gt;canyon&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Mare%20Acidalium%20quadrangle\"&gt;Mare Acidalium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lunae%20Palus%20quadrangle\"&gt;Lunae Palus&lt;/a&gt; quadrangles on &lt;a href=\"Mars\"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;, centered at 24.6\u00b0 north latitude and 65.0\u00b0 west longitude. They are long and were named for the word for \"Mars\" in Japanese. This is one of the largest &lt;a href=\"outflow%20channel\"&gt;outflow channel&lt;/a&gt; systems on Mars.\nGeography.\nThis huge system is 300 miles wide in some places. In contrast, Earth's Grand Canyon is only 18 miles wide. It is one of the longest continuous &lt;a href=\"outflow%20channel\"&gt;outflow channel&lt;/a&gt; systems on Mars. The Kasei Valles system begins in &lt;a href=\"Echus%20Chasma\"&gt;Echus Chasma&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Valles%20Marineris\"&gt;Valles Marineris&lt;/a&gt;. It runs initially northward, then turns eastward and appears to empty into &lt;a href=\"Chryse%20Planitia\"&gt;Chryse Planitia&lt;/a&gt;, not far from where &lt;a href=\"Viking%201\"&gt;Viking 1&lt;/a&gt; landed. At around 20\u00b0 north latitude the system splits into two channels, called Kasei Vallis Canyon and North Kasei Channel. These branches recombine at around 63\u00b0 west longitude, forming a large island between the channels known as &lt;a href=\"Sacra%20Mensa\"&gt;Sacra Mensa&lt;/a&gt;. Some parts of the Kasei Valles are 2\u20133\u00a0km deep.\nLike other outflow channels, they were likely carved by liquid water, possibly released by volcanic subsurface heating in the &lt;a href=\"Tharsis\"&gt;Tharsis&lt;/a&gt; region, either as a one-time catastrophic event or multiple flooding events over a long time period. Others have proposed that certain landforms were produced by glacial rather than liquid flow.\nThree sets of enormous cataracts (dry falls) are present in the area between an \"island\" feature in the southern channel, Lunae Mensae, and the crater &lt;a href=\"Sharonov%20%28Martian%20crater%29\"&gt;Sharonov&lt;/a&gt;. These cataracts, evidently carved during megaflooding events, have headwalls up to 400 m high and are considerably larger than the largest terrestrial analog, &lt;a href=\"Dry%20Falls\"&gt;Dry Falls&lt;/a&gt;. They may have migrated over 100\u00a0km upstream subsequent to their initial formation."
