    "text": "The Winzererstra\u00dfe is a two-kilometer-long street in the &lt;a href=\"Munich\"&gt;Munich&lt;/a&gt; districts of &lt;a href=\"Maxvorstadt\"&gt;Maxvorstadt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Schwabing\"&gt;Schwabing&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe Winzererstra\u00dfe starts at the Hessstra\u00dfe at the Massmannspark and runs almost parallel to &lt;a href=\"Schlei%C3%9Fheimer%20Stra%C3%9Fe%20%28Munich%29\"&gt;Schleissheimer Stra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt;, the road ends today in the North, after crossing the Ackermannstra\u00dfe, southeast of the Olympiaberg.\nThere are 11 architectural monuments, such as, the &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; building of the Prinz-Leopold-Barracks or the Obelisk in the triangle Winzererstra\u00dfe / &lt;a href=\"Lothstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Lothstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Georgenstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Georgenstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Bavarian Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Family and Integration\" is located on Winzererstra\u00dfe 9, the \"Munich Wood Research\" (&lt;a href=\"Technical%20University%20of%20Munich\"&gt;TU M\u00fcnchen&lt;/a&gt;) is located on Winzererstra\u00dfe 45, the \"Munich Department of Finance\" is located at Winzererstra\u00dfe 47a, the \"City Archive\" is located at Winzererstra\u00dfe 68, an outside office of the \"Federal Office of Freight Transport\" can be found in house number 52, and the \"Higher Labor Court\" and the \"Munich Labor Court\" are located at Winzererstra\u00dfe 106.\nHistory.\nThe street is named after the &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Landsknecht\"&gt;Landsknecht&lt;/a&gt; leader Winzerer, which in 1525 prevented the encroaching of the &lt;a href=\"German%20Peasants%27%20War\"&gt;peasant wars&lt;/a&gt; on Bavaria. It runs on a part of the Oberwiesenfeld.\nStarting in 1902, the &lt;a href=\"Bavarian%20army\"&gt;Bavarian army&lt;/a&gt; occupied the Prinz-Leopold-Kaserne.\nThe casino (\"Offizierspeiseanstalt\") at Winzererstra\u00dfe 41 - in the 1980s, until a fire, was temporarily used as a chemical factory - was later a popular film site, for example by director &lt;a href=\"Rainer%20Werner%20Fassbinder\"&gt;Rainer Werner Fassbinder&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href=\"Horst%20Schimanski\"&gt;Schimanski&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Tatort\"&gt;Tatort&lt;/a&gt;s. At that time, the filmmakers had simply completed the arduous walls for the shooting with &lt;a href=\"papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9\"&gt;papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9&lt;/a&gt; and the like. \nAround 1905, it found itself, between the Lothstra\u00dfe and the Elisabethstrasse, which had not yet been fully developed, along the Winzererstra\u00dfe existing building portion so the 1. Pionier battalions barracks, in which part of the Oberwiesenfeld barracks was found east of the Infanteriestra\u00dfe. At that time, Winzererstra\u00dfe had already been extended to &lt;a href=\"Herzogstra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Herzogstra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt;, but not asphalted.\nNorth of Herzogstra\u00dfe, in 1941, just south of the later amassed &lt;a href=\"Schuttberg\"&gt;Schuttberg&lt;/a&gt;, which later became the Olympiaberg, the &lt;a href=\"diary\"&gt;diary&lt;/a&gt; \"Nordmolkerei Deller KG\" was founded, and until the end of the 1990s was still in operation. In the year 2000, the diary was demolished and the residential complex at the Olympiapark was built. \nAfter 1946 to 1992, the Winzererstra\u00dfe formed, between &lt;a href=\"Lerchenauer%20Stra%C3%9Fe\"&gt;Lerchenauer Stra\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt; and Lothstra\u00dfe, the border between the municipalities of Schwabing-West and Neuhausen-Oberwiesenfeld.\nIt was only with the construction of Ackermannstra\u00dfe in the late 1960s, that the northern part of Winzererstra\u00dfe (from the height of house number 89) to the Lerchenauer Stra\u00dfe was paved, as part of the construction measures for the &lt;a href=\"1972%20Summer%20Olympics\"&gt;1972 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the 1970s, the access road from Lerchenauer Stra\u00dfe to the Winzererstra\u00dfe was closed for cars. Later, the sub-area below the Olympiaberg was converted, from the present residential complex at the Olympiapark to the Lerchenauer Stra\u00dfe, so that the road ends at the level of the residential complex.\n1980 until 1981, an 11-meter-long tree trunk section from Africa was set up for research purposes at the Wood Institute on Winzererstra\u00dfe 45. \nSince 1996, the Winzererstra\u00dfe between Lerchenauer Stra\u00dfe and Ackermannstra\u00dfe forms the border between the municipalities of Schwabing-West and &lt;a href=\"Milbertshofen-Am%20Hart\"&gt;Milbertshofen-Am Hart&lt;/a&gt;."
