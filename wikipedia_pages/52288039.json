    "text": "Victorian jewellery originated in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. Victorian jewellery was produced during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, whose reign lasted from 1837 to 1901. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt; was an influential figure who established the different trends in Victorian jewellery. The amount of jewellery acquired throughout the Victorian era established a person\u2019s identity and status. \u00a0Within the Victorian period, &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; consisted of a diverse variety of styles and fashions. These periods can be &lt;a href=\"Categorization\"&gt;categorised&lt;/a&gt; into three distinct timeframes: The Romantic period, the Grand period and the Aesthetic period.\nIdentity and status.\nThe role of &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20culture\"&gt;Victorian culture&lt;/a&gt; was important in determining a person\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Cultural%20identity\"&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"social%20status\"&gt;social status&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Western%20world\"&gt;Western world&lt;/a&gt; has often objectified jewels as &lt;a href=\"Aesthetics\"&gt;aesthetic&lt;/a&gt; objects that are highly desired. Jewels are much sought after due to their association with respectability, class prestige, monetary value and current trends within &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, given its status, &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; was viewed as a &lt;a href=\"commodity\"&gt;commodity&lt;/a&gt; that contributed to Victorian &lt;a href=\"capitalism\"&gt;capitalism&lt;/a&gt;. A person\u2019s status in &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt; could be demonstrated by wearing &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Consumerism\"&gt;Consumerism&lt;/a&gt; was crucial in prompting the purchasing of different types of jewels, which were able to determine a person\u2019s &lt;a href=\"wealth\"&gt;wealth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"social%20class\"&gt;social class&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the financial value of jewels, &lt;a href=\"lower%20classes\"&gt;lower classes&lt;/a&gt; could not afford to keep up with this fashion trend. If a woman did not wear &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt;, it was assumed it was because she was unable to afford it due to her position in the &lt;a href=\"working%20class\"&gt;working class&lt;/a&gt;. Due to such a large demand for particular jewels, rapid &lt;a href=\"manufacturing\"&gt;manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; assisted in producing jewels. The imitation of these particular jewels were made more affordable for &lt;a href=\"middle%20class\"&gt;middle class&lt;/a&gt; people. During the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt;, jewels were mostly worn by women. It was unconventional for men to wear jewels given jewels were considered a &lt;a href=\"Femininity\"&gt;feminine&lt;/a&gt; object. Women that wore jewels were considered an object of &lt;a href=\"beauty\"&gt;beauty&lt;/a&gt;. Although men did not wear jewels, men commonly gifted jewels to a woman they admired. \nDifferent periods of Victorian jewellery.\nJewellery throughout the Victorian era remains prominent for its design and composition. The production of &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; throughout the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt; was distinct, as it marked change and &lt;a href=\"Innovation\"&gt;innovative&lt;/a&gt; practices through the use of new &lt;a href=\"Machine\"&gt;machinery&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Machine\"&gt;Machinery&lt;/a&gt; allowed fast production of jewellery and replaced work that could be done by an individual. The collection of &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; created throughout the &lt;a href=\"Victorian%20era\"&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt; was diverse, for this reason Victorian jewellery can be divided into three distinct periods: The Romantic period, the Grand period and the Aesthetic Period. Each period consists of key features. These features consisted of different sources of inspiration, different &lt;a href=\"Material\"&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt; and prominent types of &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Romantic period (1837-1861).\nThe first period in Victorian &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; is known as the Romantic period or early Victorian period. During this period, inspiration derived from the &lt;a href=\"Renaissance\"&gt;Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; and the natural world. This period saw a rise in the use of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; material, which contributed to the construction of &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt;.\nKey features in this period consisted of: \nThe Grand period (1861- 1885).\nThe second period in Victorian &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; is known as the Grand period or the mid-Victorian period. This period saw a sharp change in design from delicate to bold which paralleled the changing social roles and representation of &lt;a href=\"Woman\"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; at the time. During this period, imitations of &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; were prominent and costume &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; originated.\u00a0This period witnessed the emergence of women in business and &lt;a href=\"politics\"&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt; and saw women demanding to study at &lt;a href=\"university\"&gt;university&lt;/a&gt;, the right to &lt;a href=\"Voting\"&gt;vote&lt;/a&gt; and to earn their own &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;. \nKey features in this period consisted of: \nThe death of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s husband, &lt;a href=\"Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort\"&gt;Prince Albert&lt;/a&gt; in 1861, also inspired the use of mourning jewellery in this period (see ) \nThe Aesthetic period (1885-1901).\nThe third period in Victorian &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; is known as the Aesthetic period or the late Victorian period. During this period, there was a distinct change in how women wore &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt;. This period encouraged the agency of women in &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt;, with women\u2019s rise to power with the creation of their own &lt;a href=\"Political%20organisation\"&gt;political organisations&lt;/a&gt;. This change encouraged &lt;a href=\"freedom%20of%20thought\"&gt;freedom of thought&lt;/a&gt; and less of a desire to be seen as feminine. Due to this, significantly less &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; was purchased with women only choosing to wear &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; on special occasions, and little &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; being worn casually throughout the day. \nKey features in this period consisted of: \nDuring this era, Queen Victoria also continued to inspire the wearing of mourning jewellery (see ).\nHair jewellery.\n&lt;a href=\"Hair%20jewellery\"&gt;Hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; became an established fashion during the mid eighteenth century. &lt;a href=\"Hair%20jewellery\"&gt;Hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; became increasingly prominent in the 1850s with this trend lasting until the 1880s. Although &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; existed before 1861, its use by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt; after the death of her husband, &lt;a href=\"Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort\"&gt;Prince Albert&lt;/a&gt;, reignited and heightened the popularity of &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe practice of using hair as mourning &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; forms part of the Victorian &lt;a href=\"Relic\"&gt;relic culture&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of incorporating hair strands into &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; is a method of &lt;a href=\"Materialism\"&gt;materialising&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Mourning\"&gt;mourning process&lt;/a&gt;. Hair is incorporated into &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; as a memento, considering it is the only part of the body that does not change or decay after &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. The use of &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; stems from the material need to create an emotional connection with the departed, even beyond the &lt;a href=\"grave\"&gt;grave&lt;/a&gt;. Hair was considered a versatile material that was incorporated into a variety of &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt;. Hair was commonly interwoven into &lt;a href=\"Bracelet\"&gt;bracelets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Earring\"&gt;earrings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brooch\"&gt;brooches&lt;/a&gt;, rings and watch chains. Materials such as &lt;a href=\"Pearl\"&gt;pearls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gemstone\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt; and enamels were commonly added to &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; as decoration. A common use for &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; was to acknowledge and remember the departed and the second use of &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; was to commemorate the departed throughout &lt;a href=\"Funeral\"&gt;funeral ceremonies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Funeral\"&gt;Funeral ceremonies&lt;/a&gt; permitted women to wear specific hair ornaments. Hair ornaments incorporated motifs of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coffin\"&gt;coffins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Angel\"&gt;angels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skull%20and%20crossbones%20%28symbol%29\"&gt;crossbones&lt;/a&gt;. The use of braided hair was also incorporated in the &lt;a href=\"Floral%20design\"&gt;floral arrangements&lt;/a&gt; used at &lt;a href=\"funeral\"&gt;funeral&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOther than their use as a romantic keepsake and their use at &lt;a href=\"Funeral\"&gt;funerals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; represented a material object and popular &lt;a href=\"fashion%20accessory\"&gt;fashion accessory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hair%20jewellery\"&gt;Hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; was not worn and accessible for all, its use was limited to &lt;a href=\"middle%20class\"&gt;middle class&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Upper%20class\"&gt;upper class women&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hair%20jewellery\"&gt;Hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; was seen as a use of tangible objects that could signify a woman\u2019s &lt;a href=\"femininity\"&gt;femininity&lt;/a&gt; and status within &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt;. The creation of &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; by a woman expressed her &lt;a href=\"femininity\"&gt;femininity&lt;/a&gt; and became a common &lt;a href=\"craft\"&gt;craft&lt;/a&gt;. A woman\u2019s ability to produce &lt;a href=\"Handicraft\"&gt;handicrafts&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated she was an &lt;a href=\"Homemaking\"&gt;ideal homemake&lt;/a&gt;r. Women that successfully produced &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated their domestic skills and womanhood within &lt;a href=\"society\"&gt;society&lt;/a&gt;. The craft of creating &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; using woven hair was a skill that was transferred between a mother and her daughter. The large demand for making &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; called for a woman's desire to be industrious from the comfort of her own home. Hair jewellery was often produced within the home environment using &lt;a href=\"Tool\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; such as a curling-iron, tweezers, gum, a porcelain pallet and a knife. An increase in women individually creating their own hair jewellery stemmed from a lack of trust for jewellers.\u00a0The act of sending hair fragments of a beloved person to a jeweller was considered a dangerous act given that there was no assurance that the hair incorporated in the jewellery belonged to their beloved. Due to this, women began the &lt;a href=\"craft\"&gt;craft&lt;/a&gt; of creating their own &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt;. \nApart from its main use as mourning jewellery, &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; also had a secondary use. This use accounts for the exchanging of sentimental jewellery by using hair from living persons to represent &lt;a href=\"friendship\"&gt;friendship&lt;/a&gt;.\nMourning jewellery.\nThe process of &lt;a href=\"mourning\"&gt;mourning&lt;/a&gt; was a long-lasting and was performed by both men and women. During the process of grieving, mourning jewellery\u00a0was predominantly worn by females. The idea of women wearing &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; during their mourning period pertains to the idea of womanhood and how women must keep their status alive to represent their &lt;a href=\"husband\"&gt;husband&lt;/a&gt;, even whilst in deep mourning. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s husband &lt;a href=\"Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort\"&gt;Prince Albert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt; entered a mourning period. This mourning period spanned more than 40 years until the death of the &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;. Many grievers participated during the mourning of &lt;a href=\"Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort\"&gt;Prince Albert.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt; enforced a mourning period upon the court. Throughout this mourning period Jet jewels were the only acceptable &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; that could be worn. The practice of wearing black mourning jewellery continued even after the mourning period of &lt;a href=\"Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort\"&gt;Prince Albert&lt;/a&gt; given the high &lt;a href=\"Infant%20mortality\"&gt;infant mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; existing in &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; at the time.\nAfter the death of a beloved, a &lt;a href=\"ritual\"&gt;ritual&lt;/a&gt; of mourning applied for grievers. The ritual commenced from the day of the person\u2019s death until at least one year after the death of the person. During this time grievers were not permitted to wear shiny or reflective materials and must be entirely dressed in black, this was inclusive of &lt;a href=\"Clothing\"&gt;clothes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, the second year of mourning permitted grievers to wear more subdued colours such as white or colourless materials, &lt;a href=\"Pearl\"&gt;pearls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt;. Wearing mourning jewellery displayed the strong connection between a beloved and the &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;deceased&lt;/a&gt; person. For this reason, the Victorian mourning period saw the development of personalised jewellery that were used as momentos. Mourning jewellery often displayed initials or the names of the deceased and their date of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; which were &lt;a href=\"Engraving\"&gt;engraved&lt;/a&gt; into the jewellery in remembrance of the departed. The symbol of &lt;a href=\"Eye\"&gt;eyes&lt;/a&gt; had a powerful significance in mourning jewellery. A single eye was often included in &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Brooch\"&gt;brooches&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"eye\"&gt;eye&lt;/a&gt; signified a spiritual presence of the departed with the person who wore the &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt;, in this way the departed could watch over the person who was wearing the jewellery. Another element often incorporated into jewellery were &lt;a href=\"Pearl\"&gt;pearls&lt;/a&gt; which represented tear drops. The fashion of mourning jewellery gradually declined in 1901 following the death of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. \nThroughout the mourning period, there were two main &lt;a href=\"Material\"&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt; that became frequently sourced in jewellery. In order to keep up with the demand for these materials sourced in mourning jewellery, imitations of these materials were discovered. Some of these imitations include hardened rubber also known as \u201cfrench jet\u201d, black enamel and black glass. The two main materials used to create mourning jewellery consisted of jet and &lt;a href=\"Onyx\"&gt;black onyx&lt;/a&gt; jewels.\nJet jewels.\nThroughout the mid nineteenth century, jet was a material that was much sought after due to its use in mourning jewellery. Due to large demand for jet, in &lt;a href=\"Whitby\"&gt;Whitby&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;), a large &lt;a href=\"Industry%20%28economics%29\"&gt;industry&lt;/a&gt; was established. The fossilised material, jet was valued because it was lightweight, intense black in colour, durable, inexpensive and could be easily &lt;a href=\"Carving\"&gt;carved&lt;/a&gt;. Jet was used to design mourning jewellery such as &lt;a href=\"Bracelet\"&gt;bracelets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Necklace\"&gt;necklaces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brooch\"&gt;brooches&lt;/a&gt;, cameos and &lt;a href=\"Pendant\"&gt;pendants&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of &lt;a href=\"Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort\"&gt;Prince Albert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen Victoria\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; love of &lt;a href=\"jewellery\"&gt;jewellery&lt;/a&gt; was less evident. The &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Victoria\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt; mostly wore jet jewels, &lt;a href=\"hair%20jewellery\"&gt;hair jewellery&lt;/a&gt; containing the &lt;a href=\"Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort\"&gt;prince&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s hair and her wedding ring. \nBlack onyx jewels.\n&lt;a href=\"Onyx\"&gt;Black onyx&lt;/a&gt; was also commonly used to make mourning jewellery. &lt;a href=\"Onyx\"&gt;Black onyx&lt;/a&gt; otherwise known as black-dyed chalcedony, was a material mostly used in constructing cameos and was used in &lt;a href=\"beadwork\"&gt;beadwork&lt;/a&gt;.
