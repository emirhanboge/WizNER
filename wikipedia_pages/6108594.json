    "text": "Beverley Martyn (born Beverley Kutner on 24 March 1947) is an English &lt;a href=\"singing\"&gt;singer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"songwriter\"&gt;songwriter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"guitarist\"&gt;guitarist&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt various times, Martyn has worked with &lt;a href=\"John%20Martyn%20%28singer%29\"&gt;John Martyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Levon%20Helm\"&gt;Levon Helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Page\"&gt;Jimmy Page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Pegg\"&gt;Dave Pegg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Richard%20Thompson%20%28musician%29\"&gt;Richard Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Renbourn\"&gt;John Renbourn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20McTell\"&gt;Ralph McTell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Davy%20Graham\"&gt;Davy Graham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sandy%20Denny\"&gt;Sandy Denny&lt;/a&gt;. She appeared in the photograph on the &lt;a href=\"album%20sleeve\"&gt;album sleeve&lt;/a&gt; of Bert Jansch's 1965 album, \"&lt;a href=\"It%20Don%27t%20Bother%20Me%20%28album%29\"&gt;It Don't Bother Me&lt;/a&gt;\", where she can be seen lounging in the background.\nEarly life and career.\nMartyn was born near &lt;a href=\"Coventry\"&gt;Coventry&lt;/a&gt;, England. While still a student, she was picked to front The Levee Breakers, a &lt;a href=\"jug%20band\"&gt;jug band&lt;/a&gt; featuring Mac McGann and Johnny Joyce, who played the folk circuit in south east England. At the age of 16 she recorded her first &lt;a href=\"single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt;. \"Babe I'm Leaving You\", which was released on the &lt;a href=\"Parlophone\"&gt;Parlophone&lt;/a&gt; label in 1965.\nMartyn was then signed as a solo artist to the &lt;a href=\"Deram%20Records\"&gt;Deram Records&lt;/a&gt; label. In 1966 she released a single, \"Happy New Year\" (&lt;a href=\"A-side%20and%20B-side\"&gt;b-side&lt;/a&gt; \"Where The Good Times Are\"), &lt;a href=\"songwriter\"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Randy%20Newman\"&gt;Randy Newman&lt;/a&gt;, on which she was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Page\"&gt;Jimmy Page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"John%20Paul%20Jones%20%28musician%29\"&gt;John Paul Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nicky%20Hopkins\"&gt;Nicky Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andy%20White%20%28drummer%29\"&gt;Andy White&lt;/a&gt;. \"Happy New Year\" was chosen as the first single release on the brand new Deram label, distributed by Decca Records, in 1966, catalogue number DM 101. The second single was the &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Stevens\"&gt;Cat Stevens&lt;/a&gt; hit, \"&lt;a href=\"I%20Love%20My%20Dog\"&gt;I Love My Dog&lt;/a&gt;\" (DM 102). She also recorded a then unreleased single in the same year, \"Picking Up The Sunshine\" / \"&lt;a href=\"Gin%20House%20Blues\"&gt;Gin House Blues&lt;/a&gt;\". These last two tracks also featured &lt;a href=\"John%20Renbourn\"&gt;John Renbourn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Lease\"&gt;Mike Lease&lt;/a&gt;. The single was released in April 2017. During that period she was taught the guitar by the folk guitarist &lt;a href=\"Bert%20Jansch\"&gt;Bert Jansch&lt;/a&gt;, who also encouraged her songwriting. Her follow-up single \"Museum\", written by &lt;a href=\"Donovan\"&gt;Donovan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"record%20producer\"&gt;produced&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Denny%20Cordell\"&gt;Denny Cordell&lt;/a&gt;, was released in 1967.\nClosely involved with the folk scene at the time, she met &lt;a href=\"Paul%20Simon\"&gt;Paul Simon&lt;/a&gt; who invited her to &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. On the &lt;a href=\"Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Garfunkel\"&gt;Simon &amp; Garfunkel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"album\"&gt;album&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Bookends%20%28album%29\"&gt;Bookends&lt;/a&gt;\", she contributed to the track \"Fakin' It\", in the middle of which she is heard saying: \"Good morning, Mr Leitch, have you had a busy day?\" She later appeared at the &lt;a href=\"Monterey%20Pop%20Festival\"&gt;Monterey Pop Festival&lt;/a&gt; on 16 June 1967, as did Simon &amp; Garfunkel.\nWith John Martyn.\nIn 1969, she met John Martyn, whom she later married. As a &lt;a href=\"duet%20%28music%29\"&gt;duo&lt;/a&gt; they issued two albums, \"&lt;a href=\"Stormbringer%21\"&gt;Stormbringer!&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Road%20to%20Ruin%20%28John%20and%20Beverley%20Martyn%20album%29\"&gt;The Road to Ruin&lt;/a&gt;\" both of which were released on &lt;a href=\"Island%20Records\"&gt;Island Records&lt;/a&gt;. Following \"The Road to Ruin\", Island persuaded John Martyn to resume his career as a solo artist, because they believed that there was more public interest in solo singer/songwriters. Although she was spending more time with her children, Martyn continued to contribute to her husband's solo projects until the breakdown of their marriage. The couple divorced during the making of John Martyn's album \"&lt;a href=\"Grace%20and%20Danger\"&gt;Grace and Danger&lt;/a&gt;\" in 1980 and she retired from music for years.\nReturn to music.\nIn the 1990s, with her children now grown, she was invited to join &lt;a href=\"Loudon%20Wainwright%20III\"&gt;Loudon Wainwright III&lt;/a&gt; on his European tour. In 1998 she resumed her recording career with the release of the album \"No Frills\".\nIn 2004, Martyn's song \"Primrose Hill\", about the simple joys of domesticity, which she wrote and sang on \"Road To Ruin\", was sampled by &lt;a href=\"Fat%20Boy%20Slim\"&gt;Fat Boy Slim&lt;/a&gt; for the track \"North West Three\" on his 2004 album \"&lt;a href=\"Palookaville%20%28album%29\"&gt;Palookaville&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOn 3 December 2013, she performed the song &lt;a href=\"When%20The%20Levee%20Breaks\"&gt;\"Levee Breaks\"&lt;/a&gt; with her band at the concert 'A Celebration Of Bert Jansch' at London's Royal Festival Hall, alongside &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Plant\"&gt;Robert Plant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Donovan\"&gt;Donovan&lt;/a&gt; and various members of &lt;a href=\"Pentangle%20%28band%29\"&gt;Pentangle&lt;/a&gt;, amongst others. The concert was broadcast by BBC4 in the UK on 28 March 2014 under the name \"The Genius of Bert Jansch: Folk Blues and Beyond\".\nMartyn released a new album in 2014 entitled \"The Phoenix and The Turtle\". It contains a previously unrecorded &lt;a href=\"Nick%20Drake\"&gt;Nick Drake&lt;/a&gt; and Martyn song, \"Reckless Jane\". The album featured bass by Matt Malley (&lt;a href=\"Counting%20Crows\"&gt;Counting Crows&lt;/a&gt;), drums by Victor Bisetti (&lt;a href=\"Los%20Lobos\"&gt;Los Lobos&lt;/a&gt;), acoustic guitars by Mark Pavey, electric guitars by Jakob Nebel (&lt;a href=\"Livingston%20%28band%29\"&gt;Livingston&lt;/a&gt;) and Michael Watts, and strings by Owain Roberts."
