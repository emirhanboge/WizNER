    "text": "Homerton College is a &lt;a href=\"Colleges%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;constituent college&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cambridge\"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;. Its first premises were acquired in &lt;a href=\"Homerton\"&gt;Homerton&lt;/a&gt;, London in 1768, by an informal gathering of &lt;a href=\"English%20Dissenters\"&gt;Protestant dissenters&lt;/a&gt; with origins in the seventeenth century. In 1894, the college moved from Homerton High Street, Hackney, London, to &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;. Homerton was admitted as an \"Approved Society\" of the university in 1976, and received its &lt;a href=\"Royal%20charter\"&gt;Royal charter&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, affirming its status as a full college of the university. The college celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2018.\nWith around 600 &lt;a href=\"undergraduates\"&gt;undergraduates&lt;/a&gt;, 800 postgraduates, and 90 &lt;a href=\"fellow\"&gt;fellow&lt;/a&gt;s, it has more students than any other Cambridge college but, because only half of those are resident undergraduates, its undergraduate presence is similar to large colleges such as &lt;a href=\"Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Trinity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;St John's&lt;/a&gt;. The college has particularly strong ties to public service, as well as academia, having educated many prominent dissenting thinkers, educationalists, politicians, and missionary explorers.\nThe college has extensive grounds which encompass sports fields, water features and beehives, and the focal point of the college, its Victorian Gothic hall. It also has a wide range of student clubs and societies, including &lt;a href=\"Homerton%20College%20Boat%20Club\"&gt;Homerton College Boat Club&lt;/a&gt;, Homerton College Music Society and the Homerton College Rugby Football Club.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe college's origins date back to the seventeenth century. In 1695, a Congregation Fund was created in London to educate &lt;a href=\"Calvinist\"&gt;Calvinist&lt;/a&gt; ministers. As non-conformists, they were barred by law from attending &lt;a href=\"Oxbridge\"&gt;Oxbridge&lt;/a&gt; colleges, and so studied a modern curriculum, with particular emphasis on philosophy, science, and modern history. In 1730, a formal society \u2013 known as the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Head%20Society\"&gt;King's Head Society&lt;/a&gt; after the pub at the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Exchange%2C%20London\"&gt;Royal Exchange&lt;/a&gt; where they held their meetings \u2013 was founded to sponsor young men to attend &lt;a href=\"dissenting%20academies\"&gt;dissenting academies&lt;/a&gt;. Today, a &lt;a href=\"secret%20society\"&gt;secret society&lt;/a&gt; and discussion club at the college of the same name maintains some of its traditions. By 1768, the Society was large enough to need its own premises, so it purchased a large property in Homerton High Street, in London's &lt;a href=\"East%20End\"&gt;East End&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy 1817, the institution had become known as \"Homerton Academy Society\", later \"Homerton College Society\". At that time, it produced some of the nation's foremost dissenting figures, many closely involved in the movements opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20slave%20trade\"&gt;slave trade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Corn%20Laws\"&gt;Corn Laws&lt;/a&gt;. For several years, the college was affiliated to the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20London\"&gt;University of London&lt;/a&gt;, but when its theological function was moved to New College London in 1850, it was re-founded by the &lt;a href=\"Congregational%20Board%20of%20Education\"&gt;Congregational Board of Education&lt;/a&gt; to concentrate on the &lt;a href=\"pedagogy\"&gt;study of education&lt;/a&gt; itself. It did so by transferring its theological courses to &lt;a href=\"New%20College%20London\"&gt;New College London&lt;/a&gt;, of which the &lt;a href=\"John%20Harris%20%28college%20head%29\"&gt;Rev. John Harris DD&lt;/a&gt; was the Congregationalist Principal, and by extending and rebuilding the old mansion house and 1820s buildings of the academy, at a cost of \u00a310,000. The college reopened in April 1852 as the Training Institution of the Congregational Board of Education, with &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Morley%20%28MP%29\"&gt;Samuel Morley&lt;/a&gt; as its treasurer. Shortly afterwards, it began admitting women students. Then Principal &lt;a href=\"John%20Horobin\"&gt;John Horobin&lt;/a&gt; called an end to mixed education in 1896, shortly after the move to Cambridge, and the college remained all-women for 80 years thereafter.\nTowards the end of the century, the growth of industry had turned the village of Homerton into a manufacturing centre, lowering the quality of life of the students and, between 1878 and 1885, there were seven deaths from &lt;a href=\"tuberculosis\"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"smallpox\"&gt;smallpox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"typhoid%20fever\"&gt;typhoid&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, increasing numbers of students required more space.\nIn 1881, former students of Homerton College who were members of Glyn Cricket Club formed a football section to help keep their players fit during the winter months. The football section continued to grow over the ensuing years and is now &lt;a href=\"Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.\"&gt;Leyton Orient Football Club&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 a fact acknowledged by an annual match between the college's football team and that of the Leyton Orient Supporters Club.\nMove to Cambridge.\nIn 1894, the Congregational Board of Education were able to purchase the estate of &lt;a href=\"Cavendish%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Cavendish College&lt;/a&gt;, Cambridge (named after the then-Chancellor of the university and not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"Lucy%20Cavendish%20College%2C%20Cambridge\"&gt;Lucy Cavendish College&lt;/a&gt;) which had become available. It had been founded to allow poorer students to sit Cambridge &lt;a href=\"tripos\"&gt;tripos&lt;/a&gt; exams without the expense of joining a true Cambridge college. It was briefly recognised as a \"Public Hostel\" of the university in 1882, but a lack of money had brought the venture to an end.\nAll its estates and furniture were bought for \u00a310,000 by the Congregational Board, and students and staff moved from the old Hackney premises into the vacant college buildings at &lt;a href=\"Cambridge\"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;. Initially taking the name of Homerton New College at Cavendish College, it shortly afterwards became just Homerton College, Cambridge. John Charles Horobin became the first Principal: his portrait hangs in the college's Great Hall.\nThe first woman to head the college was Mary Miller Allan, who was responsible for Homerton's national reputation as a trainer of women teachers. Her successor in 1935 was Miss Alice Skillicorn, a former HMI, who took the college through World War Two, during which time it was bombed. Dame &lt;a href=\"Beryl%20Paston%20Brown\"&gt;Beryl Paston Brown&lt;/a&gt; was Principal in the 1960s, at a time when Homerton's numbers doubled after the introduction of three-year training courses in 1960.\nIn December 1976, under the headship of Principal Alison Cheveley Shrubsole, Homerton was accepted as an Approved Society of the University of Cambridge following a 3\u20131 vote of the &lt;a href=\"Regent%20House\"&gt;Regent House&lt;/a&gt; in favour of its admission. The possibility of introducing a Cambridge &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Education\"&gt;Bachelor of Education&lt;/a&gt; (BEd) degree had been given as one of the reasons for the original move into Cambridge. It was after the shake-up and governmental criticisms of teacher training in the early 1970s that the university admitted Homerton because, by then, all of its students were doing four-year honours courses.\nIn late 2000, the Regent House approved a proposal to \"converge\" Homerton with the rest of the university. Convergence involved the transfer of most of the college's teaching and research activity to the new &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Cambridge%20Faculty%20of%20Education\"&gt;University of Cambridge Faculty of Education&lt;/a&gt; and the diversification of the college into a wide range of Tripos subjects. In September 2001, Homerton admitted its first non-education Tripos students. At the same time the old BEd degree was retired in favour of a three-year B.A. in Education, followed by a one-year Post Graduate Certificate of Education.\nAt the time of convergence, it was envisaged that Homerton would move from the status of Approved Society to that of Approved Foundation or full college. In December 2008 Homerton's application to move to full college status was approved by the University Council. The change in status was completed with the grant of a Royal Charter on 11 March 2010.\nBuildings and grounds.\nThe original Victorian Cavendish College buildings were constructed in 1876 in the &lt;a href=\"Gothic%20Revival\"&gt;Gothic Revival&lt;/a&gt; style, using a combination of red Suffolk brick and Bath stone dressings. One of the most notable features is an oak doorway with an ogee arch flanked above by ornamental grotesques. Several years later, the Cambridge architect William Wren designed additions to the eastern end of the college buildings in the &lt;a href=\"Neo-Gothic\"&gt;Neo-Gothic&lt;/a&gt; style \u2013 now occupied by the Principal's office. The castellated tower is the tallest part of the original college buildings, and it is possible to see the spires of &lt;a href=\"Ely%20Cathedral\"&gt;Ely Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; on a clear day from its uppermost floor.\nThe Great Hall is one of the largest and grandest dining halls in Cambridge. When it was built in 1889 it was the largest college hall in Cambridge. It now houses one of the college's most notable works of art \u2013 the celebrated &lt;a href=\"Pre-Raphaelite\"&gt;Pre-Raphaelite&lt;/a&gt; piece by &lt;a href=\"Jane%20Benham%20Hay\"&gt;Jane Benham Hay&lt;/a&gt; known as 'The Florentine Procession', painted in the 1860s and winning 'Picture of the Year' in the 1867 \"&lt;a href=\"Saturday%20Review%20%28London%29\"&gt;Saturday Review&lt;/a&gt;\". Also encircling the Hall are portraits of former Principals of the college. The Hall itself features a hammer-beam roof, American walnut panelling, a gallery, rose windows, a fleche, and a bell originating from the old college in London which sounds before the College Grace is read at Formal dinner.\nOther notable buildings of the college include the Ibberson Building built in 1914 (named after its architect, &lt;a href=\"Herbert%20George%20Ibberson\"&gt;Herbert George Ibberson&lt;/a&gt;) which is considered by many \u2013 including &lt;a href=\"Nikolaus%20Pevsner\"&gt;Nikolaus Pevsner&lt;/a&gt; in his \"Buildings of England\" \u2013 to be the college's most significant building; a fact mirrored by its Grade Two listed status, the only listed building on the site. An example of &lt;a href=\"Arts%20and%20Crafts%20movement\"&gt;arts and crafts&lt;/a&gt; style architecture, its present-day Combination Room was probably the only grade two listed gymnasium in the world. Also of interest is Trumpington House (completed in 1847, and which once held the college's wine collection in its basement) built in the style of classical revival and currently leased to the Faculty of Education.\nLike the majority of Cambridge colleges, Homerton offers on-site accommodation for its students for all three years. This is provided by four purpose-built accommodation buildings: East House, West House, South Court (the latest addition to the college, opened in 2007), and Harrison House. Harrison House exclusively houses graduate students and fellows, and was opened in November 2006. Harrison House is named after Sir &lt;a href=\"David%20Harrison%20%28chemist%29\"&gt;David Harrison&lt;/a&gt;. Other accommodation is provided in the ABC and D&amp;E blocks, both part of the main college buildings, as well as in Queen's Wing (opened by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Elizabeth%20the%20Queen%20Mother\"&gt;Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother&lt;/a&gt; in 1957) which also contains the &lt;a href=\"Homerton%20Union%20of%20Students\"&gt;Homerton Union of Students&lt;/a&gt; and both the Undergraduate and Graduate Common Rooms. Outside of university terms, the accommodation attracts extensive use for conference purposes. \nLike the other colleges of the university, Homerton's library includes thousands of books covering numerous academic disciplines. Unique to Homerton, however, is a children's book collection, which contains early editions of many famous books from 1780 onwards.\nHomerton has more green space around its buildings than many other Cambridge colleges. In its grounds are several rare examples of wild &lt;a href=\"orchid\"&gt;orchid&lt;/a&gt;s and over 150 species of plants, which act as a rich habitat for various forms of wildlife \u2013 including &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20grey%20squirrel\"&gt;grey squirrel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"carrion%20crow\"&gt;carrion crow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"woodpecker\"&gt;woodpecker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stock%20dove\"&gt;stock dove&lt;/a&gt;s, rabbits, the 'College &lt;a href=\"red%20fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;', and in the summer a small colony of &lt;a href=\"Swift%20%28bird%29\"&gt;swift&lt;/a&gt;s, which nest under the eaves of the roof of the Cavendish building after their return from Africa. There is also a large &lt;a href=\"orchard\"&gt;orchard&lt;/a&gt;, where students relax in warm weather.\nStudent life.\nTraditions.\nHomerton has several unique traditions. At its Matriculation Dinner new undergraduates are made to form two lines and drink wine from the 'Homerton Horn' \u2013 an African cow horn with silver mounts, whilst speaking several &lt;a href=\"Anglo-Saxon\"&gt;Anglo-Saxon&lt;/a&gt; phrases to one another (including the greeting \"Wassail!\", and the response \"Frith and Freondship sae th'y'\" \u2013 'peace and friendship be with you'). In recent years, the tradition has been adapted so that undergraduates say these Anglo-Saxon phrases to the person sat across from them on the table, and take subsequent drinks from their own glasses, rather than every undergraduate drinking from the ceremonial horn, which has historically resulted in epidemics of 'Freshers Flu'.\nBecause the college was all-female for much of its history, the design of the college gown is that of those traditionally worn by female undergraduates in early twentieth century Cambridge (this is shared by all the historically-female colleges: Girton, Newnham, and Murray Edwards). The gown is based on the original Cambridge black gown, still worn by undergraduates at Peterhouse, but has the slits in the sleeves closed up. As a homage to its all-female origins, or simply because the college has never had one re-designed, this gown is now worn by all undergraduates at the college regardless of sex.\nHomerton Union of Students.\nThe Homerton Union of Students is one of the most active &lt;a href=\"Students%27%20union\"&gt;student unions&lt;/a&gt; in the university. The President - the only paid, sabbatical Presidency of all the Cambridge colleges - manages, along with a Vice-President Internal and a Vice President External, a team of students on the executive committee and a team of 'Liberation officers'. Together, they organise '&lt;a href=\"Freshers%20Week\"&gt;Freshers Week&lt;/a&gt;'. Homerton's Fresher's week is longer than in most colleges, where students only have two to three days of 'Freshers week' before the start of term. They also organise events throughout the year for students, as well as offer pastoral support.\nEvery year, the union organises &lt;a href=\"Harry%20Potter\"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt; formals, which take place in the college's Great Hall, and include real owls. \nMay Ball.\nThe college holds an annual &lt;a href=\"May%20Ball%20in%20Cambridge\"&gt;May Ball in Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, the ball was attended by over 1500 guests, the largest ever hosted on Homerton's grounds, to celebrate the college's 250th anniversary.\nBoat Club.\n&lt;a href=\"Homerton%20College%20Boat%20Club\"&gt;Homerton College Boat Club&lt;/a&gt; (HCBC) is the rowing club of the college. HCBC colours are navy blue with white trim, although the club's &lt;a href=\"Zephyr%20%28cloth%29\"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt; (garment) is white with blue trim. It is traditional to wear a sock of each of the boat club's colours when racing with a blue sock on the foot opposite the rigger.\nThe Men's 1st VIII hold the &lt;a href=\"Oxbridge\"&gt;Oxbridge&lt;/a&gt; record for the most places advanced during one series of bumps (either &lt;a href=\"May%20Bumps\"&gt;Mays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lent%20Bumps\"&gt;Lents&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Torpids\"&gt;Torpids&lt;/a&gt;/Eights for Oxford), advancing 13 places in the &lt;a href=\"May%20Bumps%202001\"&gt;May Bumps 2001&lt;/a&gt;, where the crew moved up a division to division 3 and also won blades.\nPeople associated with Homerton.\nPrincipals, treasurers, fellows (including honorary fellows) or students who studied at Homerton Academy or Homerton College before and after it officially became part of Cambridge University. Graduates of the college are collectively known as \"Homertonians\".\nPrincipals.\nA list of Homerton principals since the college moved to Cambridge in 1894:"
