    "text": "Am B\u00e0thach is a &lt;a href=\"Scotland\"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; mountain situated at the head of Glen Shiel, at the western end of &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Cluanie\"&gt;Loch Cluanie&lt;/a&gt; some south east of &lt;a href=\"Kyle%20of%20Lochalsh\"&gt;Kyle of Lochalsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nAm B\u00e0thach reaches a height of 798 metres (2,618\u00a0feet) and is a lone &lt;a href=\"Hill%20lists%20in%20the%20British%20Isles\"&gt;Corbett&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by considerably higher &lt;a href=\"Munros\"&gt;Munros&lt;/a&gt;. Its grassy slopes are in marked contrast to the rockier peaks of the other Glen Shiel hills. it is often climbed along with the adjoining Munro of &lt;a href=\"Ciste%20Dhubh\"&gt;Ciste Dhubh&lt;/a&gt; with the route over Am B\u00e0thach providing a more interesting and drier route to the Munro than the boggy An Caorann Beag glen. The hill offers an interesting half day walk when ascended on its own and it is frequently the only one of the Kintail mountains in the clear when weather conditions are poor. Am B\u00e0thach's roof like shape made up of a long NE-SW ridge with steep sides is alleged to resemble a cow shed or a &lt;a href=\"wikt%3Abyre\"&gt;byre&lt;/a&gt; and that is the meaning of its translated name, a throwback to the time when cattle where a prominent feature of the &lt;a href=\"Scottish%20Highlands\"&gt;Scottish Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nAm B\u00e0thach's summit ridge is roughly in length with the highest point lying at the northern extremity, and the southern end of the ridge having a &lt;a href=\"spot%20height\"&gt;spot height&lt;/a&gt; of . There is a &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20pass\"&gt;col&lt;/a&gt; with a height of at the midpoint in between the two high points. The steep slopes on either side of the mountain drop down to the valleys of the An Caorann Beag on its west side and the An Caorann M\u00f2r on the eastern flanks, both these hillsides are seamed with numerous small streams. The southern ridge of Am B\u00e0thach descends to the &lt;a href=\"A87%20road\"&gt;A87 road&lt;/a&gt; as it passes along the northern shore of &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Cluanie\"&gt;Loch Cluanie&lt;/a&gt; and has been planted with coniferous woodland on its lower slopes, this plantation is an outlying eastern section of the Glenshiel Forest.\nThe hills northern flank descends by a NW ridge down to the Bealach a\u2019 Ch\u00f2inich (Pass of the Bog) with a height of . The pass, which lives up to its name connects to the two Munros of Ciste Dhubh and &lt;a href=\"Aonach%20Meadhoin\"&gt;Aonach Meadhoin&lt;/a&gt; and has a small lochan lying on it. Am B\u00e0thach is drained by the Allt a\u2019 Chaorainn Bhig and the Allt a\u2019 Chaorainn Mh\u00f2ir, the two burns which flow down the glens to the east and west of the hill. They flow to Loch Cluanie and reach the east coast of Scotland at the &lt;a href=\"Moray%20Firth\"&gt;Moray Firth&lt;/a&gt;, some distant, via &lt;a href=\"Glenmoriston\"&gt;Glenmoriston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Ness\"&gt;Loch Ness&lt;/a&gt;.\nAscents.\nThere is really only one route of ascent for Am B\u00e0thach, this is the climb from the A87 road to the south. The only alternative is passing over the hill when descending from the Munro of Ciste Dhubh. The route from the A87 starts at the car park next to the Cluanie Inn (grid reference ). From here the southern ridge of Am B\u00e0thach can be accessed by walking east for along the A87 and then following an old stalkers path which leaves the road and goes to the right of the plantation to climb the southern ridge of the mountain to the summit. The summit is a good place to admire the surrounding Munros of Kintail. Loch Cluanie is well seen to the south and the Cluanie Inn is in view at its west end.\nReferences.\nFootnotes"
