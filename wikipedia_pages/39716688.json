    "text": "Champion is an &lt;a href=\"opera\"&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; in two acts and ten scenes with music by &lt;a href=\"Terence%20Blanchard\"&gt;Terence Blanchard&lt;/a&gt; and a libretto by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Cristofer\"&gt;Michael Cristofer&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the life of African-American &lt;a href=\"welterweight\"&gt;welterweight&lt;/a&gt; boxer &lt;a href=\"Emile%20Griffith\"&gt;Emile Griffith&lt;/a&gt;, this opera is a joint co-commission by &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Theatre%20of%20Saint%20Louis\"&gt;Opera Theatre of Saint Louis&lt;/a&gt; (OTSL) and Jazz St. Louis. \nBackground.\n\"Champion\" developed out of conversations between OTSL and Jazz St. Louis, and the companies' shared desire to collaborate on a commission that would combine opera and &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt;. Blanchard himself described the work, his first opera, with the term \"opera in jazz\" rather than a \"jazz opera\". In 2011, the Whitaker Foundation of St. Louis provided the initial $200,000 leadership gift needed to fund the commissioning and development costs of the new work. In 2012, Opera Theatre received a $1M (USD) challenge grant from The &lt;a href=\"Andrew%20W.%20Mellon%20Foundation\"&gt;Andrew W. Mellon Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which would underwrite a substantial portion of the production costs of \"Champion\", as well as Ricky Ian Gordon's opera \"27\" (premiered at OTSL in 2014) and a new production of Tobias Picker's \"Emmeline\" (presented in 2015). Additional support for \"Champion\" was provided by the Fred M. Saigh Endowment at Opera Theatre, the National Endowment for the Arts, OPERA America's \"Opera Fund\", Emily Rauh Pulitzer, Phoebe Dent Weil, and The Aaron Copland Fund for Music.\nPerformance history.\nIt received its premiere at the Loretto-Hilton Center for the Performing Arts, &lt;a href=\"Webster%20University\"&gt;Webster University&lt;/a&gt;, on 15 June 2013. The opera received its second production, with a revised orchestration by Blanchard, by &lt;a href=\"operaparelle.org\"&gt;Opera Parall\u00e8le&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, in collaboration with &lt;a href=\"SFJAZZ\"&gt;SFJAZZ&lt;/a&gt;, on February 21, 2016. The third production of the opera was on March 5, 2017 by &lt;a href=\"Washington%20National%20Opera\"&gt;Washington National Opera&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts\"&gt;John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts&lt;/a&gt;. \nA 2020 production scheduled at Michigan Opera Theatre was cancelled due to COVID-19. &lt;a href=\"Boston%20Lyric%20Opera\"&gt;Boston Lyric Opera&lt;/a&gt; will present their cancelled 2020 production in May 2022.\nIn December 2021, the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Opera\"&gt;Metropolitan Opera&lt;/a&gt; announced that they would stage \"Champion\" in April 2023. Composer Blanchard and librettist Cristofer intend to make revisions for the production. The announcement came after the Metropolitan's successful production of Blanchard's second opera, \"&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Shut%20Up%20in%20My%20Bones\"&gt;Fire Shut Up in My Bones&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSynopsis.\nAct I\nScene 1 begins in Emile Griffith's apartment in &lt;a href=\"Hempstead%2C%20Long%20Island\"&gt;Hempstead, Long Island&lt;/a&gt;, where he is struggling to dress himself. Suffering from &lt;a href=\"dementia\"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, he is confused and haunted by his past, which the opera presents in flashback. Luis, his adopted son and caretaker, reminds him to be ready for an important meeting with Benny Paret, Jr.\n\"Late 1950s\": Emile is a young man in St. Thomas, the US Virgin Islands. He wants to find his mother, Emelda, and make his fortune in America as a singer, a baseball player, and a hat designer. Emile moves to New York. When he finds his mother, she is confused, not sure which of her seven abandoned children he is, but overjoyed. Hoping to find work for Emile, she takes him to meet Howie Albert, a hat manufacturer. Howie sees an opportunity, in that Emile is physically like a boxer, not a hat-maker. Howie decides to train Emile for prizefighting. Giving up his other dreams, Emile quickly develops into a talented welterweight. Lonely and confused by his success, Emile finds his way to a gay bar in &lt;a href=\"Manhattan\"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, whose owner, Kathy Hagan, welcomes him to a frightening and also attractive world. Emile confides in Kathy, revealing some demons from his past. As a boy, his fundamentalist cousin Blanche forced him to hold cinderblocks above his head as punishment for 'having the devil inside him', which gave him his great physical strength.\n\"1962\": Emile meets &lt;a href=\"Benny%20Paret\"&gt;Benny Paret&lt;/a&gt; at a weigh-in for their upcoming fight. Paret taunts Emile with the term 'maric\u00f3n', a disparaging Spanish word for a homosexual. Alone with Howie, Emile tries to talk to him frankly about why this word hurts him so deeply, but for Howie this is something that no one in the fight business wants to talk about. Howie leaves him and Emile wonders what it means to be a man. Emile and Paret prepare for the big fight. Paret continues to taunt Emile, who ultimately delivers seventeen blows in less than seven seconds, which puts Paret into a coma.\nAct II\nBack in Emile's bedroom in the present, Emile is haunted by the ghost of Kid Paret who still questions his old opponent.\n\"Mid- to late 1960s\": Emile is enjoying a strong winning streak all over the world. Titles, trophies, and money roll in, but he remains disturbed by the death of Kid Paret. He tries living it up, and, denying his own identity, he takes a young bride, Sadie, although everyone, including his mother Emelda, who remembers her own childhood back in the Islands, warns him against it.\n\"Early 1970s\": After the wedding, Emile's luck has changed. He's now on a long losing streak of matches, and beginning to exhibit signs of \"boxer's brain\", or trauma-related dementia. Howie realizes that Emile's days are numbered and tries to console him. However, Emile rejects Howie, as well as his wife and his mother. Instead, he looks for comfort back at Kathy's bar. Outside in the street, a group of thugs taunt him and beat him violently, exacerbating his brain injuries.\nBack in the present, Emile relives the nightmare of the attack. Luis tries to comfort him (\"That was long ago\"). In a New York City park, Emile asks for forgiveness from Benny Jr. Luis tells Benny that since that evening, Emile has struggled to find peace with what he's done and who he truly is. Back at home, the voices and memories subside.\nCritical reception.\nPremiere.\nAt its premiere, \"Champion\" received generally favourable critical reviews, with respect to the production, direction, and performances of the cast. Several critics noted the coincidence of the production of \"Champion\" with then-current events in the USA related to violence against gay people, the attention given to basketball player &lt;a href=\"Jason%20Collins\"&gt;Jason Collins&lt;/a&gt; (the first openly gay athlete with a major American sports team), and the ruling earlier in 2013 by the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Marriage%20Act\"&gt;Defense of Marriage Act&lt;/a&gt;. Commentary on the music and libretto was more mixed, though on balance favourable:\nSecond production.\nAt the first performance of the second production, in San Francisco, criticisms were similar to the premiere, though again on balance positive:\nWashington National Opera production.\nThe Washington National Opera production had comparable critiques of the work:"
