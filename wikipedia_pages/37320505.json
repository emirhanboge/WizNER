    "text": "During the &lt;a href=\"Cold%20War\"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Romania\"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dictator\"&gt;dictator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nicolae%20Ceau%C8%99escu\"&gt;Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu&lt;/a&gt; presided over the most pervasive &lt;a href=\"cult%20of%20personality\"&gt;cult of personality&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Bloc\"&gt;Eastern Bloc&lt;/a&gt;. Inspired by the &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung%27s%20cult%20of%20personality\"&gt;personality cult&lt;/a&gt; surrounding &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung\"&gt;Kim Il-sung&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, it started with the 1971 &lt;a href=\"July%20Theses\"&gt;July Theses&lt;/a&gt; which reversed the &lt;a href=\"liberalization\"&gt;liberalization&lt;/a&gt; of the 1960s, imposed a strict &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20nationalism\"&gt;nationalist ideology&lt;/a&gt;, established &lt;a href=\"Stalinist\"&gt;Stalinist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"totalitarianism\"&gt;totalitarianism&lt;/a&gt; and a return to &lt;a href=\"Socialist%20realism%20in%20Romania\"&gt;socialist realism&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, the cult of personality was just focused on Ceau\u0219escu himself. By the early 1980s, however, his wife, &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Ceau%C8%99escu\"&gt;Elena Ceau\u0219escu&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one of the few spouses of a Communist leader to become a power in her own right\u2014was also a focus of the cult.\nOrigin.\nEarly seeds of the cult of personality can be found in the acclamation of Ceau\u0219escu following &lt;a href=\"Ceausescu%27s%20speech%20of%2021%20August%201968\"&gt;his speech&lt;/a&gt; in which he denounced the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia\"&gt;Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt; in 1968. From that date, there was an increasing identification of Romania with Ceau\u0219escu in both the Romanian media and in the statements of other officials. The real beginning of the cult of personality, however, came after Ceau\u0219escu visited &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China\"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"North%20Korea\"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; in 1971. He was particularly impressed by the highly personal way that China's &lt;a href=\"Mao%20Zedong\"&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/a&gt; and North Korea's &lt;a href=\"Kim%20Il-sung\"&gt;Kim Il-sung&lt;/a&gt; ruled their countries, as well as the personality cults surrounding them.\nCeau\u0219escu's predecessor, &lt;a href=\"Gheorghe%20Gheorghiu-Dej\"&gt;Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej&lt;/a&gt;, had been the subject of a personality cult. However, the cult surrounding Ceau\u0219escu went well beyond anything surrounding Gheorghiu-Dej, with one observer describing it as a \"&lt;a href=\"sultan\"&gt;sultan&lt;/a&gt;istic regime.\"\nCharacteristics.\nCeau\u0219escu became president of the &lt;a href=\"State%20Council%20of%20Romania\"&gt;State Council&lt;/a&gt; in 1967, making him \"&lt;a href=\"de%20jure\"&gt;de jure&lt;/a&gt;\" as well as \"&lt;a href=\"de%20facto\"&gt;de facto&lt;/a&gt;\" head of state. In 1974, he had the post upgraded to a full-fledged executive post, the &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Romania\"&gt;President of the Republic&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, he was given a king-like \"Presidential &lt;a href=\"sceptre\"&gt;sceptre&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD\"&gt;Salvador Dal\u00ed&lt;/a&gt; congratulated him for his new sceptre in a telegram published by the state-controlled press in Romania, which failed to notice its sarcasm: \nAdditionally, Ceau\u0219escu was chairman of the Supreme Council for Economic and Social Development, president of the National Council of Working People, and chairman of the Socialist Democracy and Unity Front.\nFrom early years, schoolchildren learned poems and songs in which the \"party, the leader and the nation\" are praised.\nThe purpose of the cult was to make any public opposition to Ceau\u0219escu impossible, because he was considered by definition to be &lt;a href=\"infallible\"&gt;infallible&lt;/a&gt; and above any criticism.\nMedia portrayals.\nCeau\u0219escu began to be portrayed by the Romanian media as a &lt;a href=\"Theoretician%20%28Marxism%29\"&gt;communist theoretician&lt;/a&gt; of genius who made significant contributions to &lt;a href=\"Marxism-Leninism\"&gt;Marxism-Leninism&lt;/a&gt; and a political leader whose \"thought\" was the source of all national accomplishments. His collected works have been republished at regular intervals and translated into several languages. The works eventually numbered dozens of volumes and were omnipresent in Romanian bookstores. Elena was portrayed as the \"Mother of the Nation.\" By all accounts, her vanity and her desire for honours exceeded that of her husband.\nThe media used the expression \"golden era of Ceau\u0219escu\" and a plethora of formulaic appellations such as \"guarantor of the nation's progress and independence\" and \"visionary architect of the nation's future\". &lt;a href=\"Dan%20Ionescu\"&gt;Dan Ionescu&lt;/a&gt;, a writer for &lt;a href=\"Radio%20Free%20Europe\"&gt;Radio Free Europe&lt;/a&gt; compiled a list of epithets for Ceau\u0219escu that were used by Romanian writers. They included \"architect\", \"celestial body\" (&lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Beniuc\"&gt;Mihai Beniuc&lt;/a&gt;), \"demiurge\", \"secular god\" (&lt;a href=\"Corneliu%20Vadim%20Tudor\"&gt;Corneliu Vadim Tudor&lt;/a&gt;), \"fir tree\", \"Prince Charming\" (&lt;a href=\"Ion%20Manole\"&gt;Ion Manole&lt;/a&gt;), \"genius\", \"saint\" (&lt;a href=\"Eugen%20Barbu\"&gt;Eugen Barbu&lt;/a&gt;), \"miracle\", \"morning star\" (&lt;a href=\"Vasile%20Andronache\"&gt;Vasile Andronache&lt;/a&gt;), \"navigator\" (&lt;a href=\"Victor%20Nistea\"&gt;Victor Nistea&lt;/a&gt;), \"saviour\" (&lt;a href=\"Niculae%20Stoian\"&gt;Niculae Stoian&lt;/a&gt;), \"sun\" (&lt;a href=\"Alexandru%20Andri%C8%9Boiu\"&gt;Alexandru Andri\u021boiu&lt;/a&gt;), \"titan\" (&lt;a href=\"Ion%20Potopin\"&gt;Ion Potopin&lt;/a&gt;) and \"visionary\" (&lt;a href=\"Viorel%20Cozma\"&gt;Viorel Cozma&lt;/a&gt;). He was most commonly described as the \"&lt;a href=\"Conduc%C4%83tor\"&gt;Conduc\u0103tor&lt;/a&gt;\", or \"the leader.\"\nHowever, he was also described as being a man of humble origins, who had risen to the top through his own efforts, and was thus linked symbolically to common folk heroes in Romanian history, such as &lt;a href=\"Horea\"&gt;Horea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avram%20Iancu\"&gt;Avram Iancu&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot surprisingly, the Ceau\u0219escus were greatly concerned about their public image. Most photos of them showed them in their late 40s. &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Television\"&gt;Romanian state television&lt;/a&gt; was under strict orders to portray them in the best possible light. For instance, producers had to take great care to ensure that Ceau\u0219escu's small stature (he was tall) was never emphasized on screen. Elena was never seen in profile because of her large nose and overall homely appearance. Consequences for breaking these rules were severe; one producer showed footage of Ceau\u0219escu blinking and stuttering, and was banned for three months.\nAt one time, the ubiquitous photographs of Ceau\u0219escu were all representing one photo in which he was shown in half-profile, with just one ear showing. After a joke spread about this being the portrait \"in one ear\" (a Romanian idiom meaning \"to be crazy\"), the photographs from profile were considered improper and the portraits were replaced with new photographs in which both ears were clearly visible.\nArts and literature.\nIntellectuals were called upon to voice their appreciation of Ceau\u0219escu. In 1973, a large tome called \"Omagiu\" (\"Homage\") was published in his praise. By the 1980s, annual volumes of praise by Romanian intellectuals were published, containing prose, poetry and songs. These volumes were published on Nicolae's birthday, which was a &lt;a href=\"Public%20holiday\"&gt;national holiday&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtists such as painter &lt;a href=\"Sabin%20B%C4%83la%C8%99a\"&gt;Sabin B\u0103la\u0219a&lt;/a&gt; depicted Ceau\u0219escu in works of art commissioned by the state.\nDissent.\nWithin civil society.\nAccording to dissident &lt;a href=\"Mihai%20Botez\"&gt;Mihai Botez&lt;/a&gt;, the main reason why few people were willing to openly express &lt;a href=\"dissent\"&gt;dissent&lt;/a&gt; was not just an issue of courage, but also a &lt;a href=\"cost%E2%80%93benefit%20analysis\"&gt;cost\u2013benefit analysis&lt;/a&gt;: many people realized that speaking out would do nothing to hurt the well-organized regime, because they would suffer the consequences for doing so, such as being expelled from the university, sent into &lt;a href=\"internal%20exile\"&gt;internal exile&lt;/a&gt; or forced to leave the country.\nThe problem was also augmented by the fact that until the late 1980s, Western countries had good relations with Ceau\u015fescu and they didn't care about Romania's internal problems. The admiration for Romania's independent policies expressed by the United States, United Kingdom, France and Japan discouraged the opposition. Mihai Botez said he felt that for years, dissidents like him were perceived as \"enemies of the West\" because they were trying to distance Ceau\u0219escu from the United States.\nThe Western countries' support for Ceau\u0219escu ended with the rise of &lt;a href=\"Mikhail%20Gorbachev\"&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/a&gt; in March 1985, when Ceau\u0219escu ceased to be relevant on the world scene and Western countries criticised him for his unwillingness to implement his own version of \"&lt;a href=\"perestroika\"&gt;perestroika&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"glasnost\"&gt;glasnost&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWithin the Communist Party.\nThere was little dissent within the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Communist%20Party\"&gt;Romanian Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;. One major incident was in November 1979, during the Twelfth Congress of the Communist Party, when an elderly high-ranking official, &lt;a href=\"Constantin%20P%C3%AErvulescu\"&gt;Constantin P\u00eervulescu&lt;/a&gt;, accused the Congress of doing little to address the problems then existing inside the country, because it was instead preoccupied with perpetuating Ceau\u0219escu's glorification. Following this, he was expelled from the Congress and put under strict surveillance and house arrest.\nLegacy.\nBy the late 1980s, the Communist Party\u2014and indeed, nearly all other institutions in Romania\u2014had become completely subordinated to Ceau\u0219escu's will. This was in contrast to the situation in other communist countries for the time being, where leaders were merely first among equals, even with the great power that came with their posts. Although Ceau\u0219escu was a &lt;a href=\"National%20Communism%20in%20Romania\"&gt;national Communist&lt;/a&gt;, his absolute control over the country and the pervasiveness of the cult led several non-Romanian observers to describe his regime as one of the closest things to an old-style &lt;a href=\"Stalinism\"&gt;Stalinist&lt;/a&gt; regime. Partly due to the PCR's subordination to Ceau\u0219escu, it disappeared in the immediate aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Romanian%20Revolution\"&gt;Romanian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and has never been revived.\nDue to the cult of personality and along with it the concentration of power in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Ceau%C8%99escu%20family\"&gt;Ceau\u0219escu family&lt;/a&gt;, much of the Romanian people's frustration was directed personally against Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, rather than against the political apparatus of the Communist Party as a whole. This is perhaps why the winner of the &lt;a href=\"1990%20Romanian%20general%20election\"&gt;1990 general election&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"National%20Salvation%20Front%20%28Romania%29\"&gt;National Salvation Front&lt;/a&gt;, made up largely of former Communist Party members."
