    "text": "The Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences (, or PASS) was established on 1 January 1994 by &lt;a href=\"Pope%20John%20Paul%20II\"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt; and is headquartered in the &lt;a href=\"Casina%20Pio%20IV\"&gt;Casina Pio IV&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20City\"&gt;Vatican City&lt;/a&gt;. It operates much like other &lt;a href=\"learned%20society\"&gt;learned societies&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, but has the special task of entering into dialogue with the Church. Its scientific activities are organised and focused to promote this dialogue.\nHistory.\nPASS is one of the ten &lt;a href=\"pontifical%20academy\"&gt;pontifical academies&lt;/a&gt; at the Vatican in Rome. It was established to promote the study of &lt;a href=\"social%20sciences\"&gt;social sciences&lt;/a&gt;, primarily &lt;a href=\"economics\"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sociology\"&gt;sociology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"political%20science\"&gt;political science&lt;/a&gt;. Through appropriate dialogue it offers the &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; elements useful to the development of its &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20social%20teaching\"&gt;social teaching&lt;/a&gt;, and it reflects on the application of that doctrine in contemporary society. PASS, which is autonomous, maintains a close relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Council%20for%20Justice%20and%20Peace\"&gt;Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrench economist &lt;a href=\"Edmond%20Malinvaud\"&gt;Edmond Malinvaud&lt;/a&gt; was the first president of the academy, from 1994 to 2000. In April 2014, &lt;a href=\"Pope%20Francis\"&gt;Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt; appointed British sociologist &lt;a href=\"Margaret%20Archer\"&gt;Margaret Archer&lt;/a&gt; to the post. On 27 March 2019 she was replaced by Prof. &lt;a href=\"Stefano%20Zamagni\"&gt;Stefano Zamagni&lt;/a&gt;.\nPASS is headquartered in the &lt;a href=\"Casina%20Pio%20IV\"&gt;Casina Pio IV&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Vatican%20Gardens\"&gt;Vatican Gardens&lt;/a&gt; along with its sister academy, the &lt;a href=\"Pontifical%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;Pontifical Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. The Chancellor of both academies is Monsignor &lt;a href=\"Marcelo%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Sorondo\"&gt;Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Sorondo&lt;/a&gt;.\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences| ]]\n[[Category:Catholic social teaching]]\n[[Category:National academies of arts and humanities|Pontificate]]"
