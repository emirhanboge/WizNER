    "text": "The Southeastern Conference (SEC) is an American college &lt;a href=\"athletic%20conference\"&gt;athletic conference&lt;/a&gt; whose member institutions are located primarily in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Central%20United%20States\"&gt;South Central&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southeastern%20United%20States\"&gt;Southeastern United States&lt;/a&gt;. Its fourteen members include the &lt;a href=\"Flagship%20university\"&gt;flagship&lt;/a&gt; public universities of ten states, three additional public &lt;a href=\"Land-grant%20university\"&gt;land-grant universities&lt;/a&gt;, and one private research university. The conference is headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Birmingham, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. The SEC participates in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (NCAA) &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I\"&gt;Division I&lt;/a&gt; in sports competitions; for &lt;a href=\"college%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; it is part of the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20Football%20Bowl%20Subdivision\"&gt;Football Bowl Subdivision&lt;/a&gt; (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A.\nMembers of the SEC have won many national championships: 43 in football, 21 in basketball, 41 in indoor track, 42 in outdoor track, 24 in swimming, 20 in gymnastics, 13 in baseball (College World Series), and one in volleyball. In &lt;a href=\"1992%20SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, the SEC was the first NCAA Division I conference to hold a &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;championship game&lt;/a&gt; (and award a subsequent title) for football and was one of the founding member conferences of the &lt;a href=\"Bowl%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;Bowl Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; (BCS). The current SEC commissioner is &lt;a href=\"Greg%20Sankey\"&gt;Greg Sankey&lt;/a&gt;, who has been the commissioner since 2015. The conference sponsors team championships in nine men's sports and twelve women's sports. The conference is successful financially, with high revenue distribution to its members. During the fiscal year 2014\u201315 an SEC record $455.8 million was generated, which was a sizable increase over the $292.8 million for the 2013\u201314, largely due to the revenue from the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Network\"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/a&gt;, a television network operated by the conference dedicated to SEC conference athletic events.\nOn July 27, 2021, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oklahoma\"&gt;University of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin\"&gt;University of Texas at Austin&lt;/a&gt; (Texas) of the &lt;a href=\"Big%2012%20Conference\"&gt;Big 12 Conference&lt;/a&gt; submitted formal requests to join the SEC. On July 29, 2021, the presidents and chancellors of the current 14 SEC schools voted unanimously to offer membership to both schools, with both schools officially accepting the invitation the next day. The Sooners and Longhorns possess the Big 12's top two highest-earning athletics programs, with the Longhorns earning the nation's largest revenue. The Sooners earn the nation's eighth-largest revenue, which would be fifth-highest in the SEC.\nMember universities.\nCurrent members.\nThe SEC consists of 14 member institutions located in the U.S. states of &lt;a href=\"Alabama\"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkansas\"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florida\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29\"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kentucky\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Louisiana\"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mississippi\"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Missouri\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina\"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tennessee\"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The SEC is divided into East and West Divisions, although the divisional alignment is not strictly geographic, with Missouri in the East Division while being further west than several West Division schools, and Auburn in the West Division despite being located further east than East Division schools Missouri and Vanderbilt. These divisional groupings are applied only in football, baseball, and women's soccer, for both scheduling and standings purposes. In football, the two division winners meet in the &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;SEC Championship Game&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince July 1, 2012, there are 14 members, with Vanderbilt being the only private institution.\nFuture members.\nOn July 27, 2021, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; formally notified the SEC they were seeking \"an invitation for membership\" beginning July 1, 2025. On July 29, 2021, the presidents of the current 14 schools of the SEC voted unanimously to extend an offer of admission to Oklahoma and Texas. On July 30, 2021, both institutions' boards of regents unanimously voted to accept the invitation, effective for the 2025\u201326 academic year.\nHistory.\nFounding and former members.\nThe SEC was established December 8 and 9, 1932, in Knoxville, TN, when the thirteen members of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Conference\"&gt;Southern Conference&lt;/a&gt; located west and south of the &lt;a href=\"Appalachian%20Mountains\"&gt;Appalachian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; left to form their own conference. Ten of the thirteen founding members have remained in the conference since its inception: the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Alabama\"&gt;University of Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auburn%20University\"&gt;Auburn University&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Florida\"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Kentucky\"&gt;University of Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Louisiana%20State%20University\"&gt;Louisiana State University&lt;/a&gt; (\"LSU\"), the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Mississippi\"&gt;University of Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; (\"Ole Miss\"), &lt;a href=\"Mississippi%20State%20University\"&gt;Mississippi State University&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Tennessee\"&gt;University of Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vanderbilt%20University\"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe other charter members were:\nRacial Integration.\nMuch controversy preceded the &lt;a href=\"1956%20Sugar%20Bowl\"&gt;1956 Sugar Bowl&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"1955%20Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football%20team\"&gt;Pitt Panthers&lt;/a&gt;, with African-American fullback &lt;a href=\"Bobby%20Grier%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Bobby Grier&lt;/a&gt; on the roster, met the &lt;a href=\"1955%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football%20team\"&gt;Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets&lt;/a&gt;. There had been controversy over whether Grier should be allowed to play due to his race, and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgia's &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20governors%20of%20Georgia\"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Griffin\"&gt;Marvin Griffin&lt;/a&gt;'s opposition to racial integration. After Griffin publicly sent a telegram to the state's Board of Regents requesting Georgia Tech not to engage in racially integrated events, Georgia Tech's president &lt;a href=\"Blake%20R%20Van%20Leer\"&gt;Blake R Van Leer&lt;/a&gt; rejected the request and threatened to resign. The game went on as planned.\nThe 1959 Mississippi State men's basketball team, led by all-American &lt;a href=\"Bailey%20Howell\"&gt;Bailey Howell&lt;/a&gt;, finished its season 24\u20131, winning the conference title, but did not participate in the NCAA tournament as they would have played against Blacks. Four years later, in 1963, &lt;a href=\"Loyola%20Ramblers%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Loyola&lt;/a&gt;, with four Black starters, played Mississippi State in the \"&lt;a href=\"Game%20of%20Change\"&gt;Game of Change&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIt was not until 1966 that African Americans first participated in an SEC athletic contest, and the first black scholarship athletes did not play in the SEC until the 1967\u201368 school year.\nThe first African American to compete in the SEC was Stephen Martin, who &lt;a href=\"Walk-on%20%28sports%29\"&gt;walked on&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Tulane%20Green%20Wave%20baseball\"&gt;Tulane baseball team&lt;/a&gt; in that school's final SEC season of 1966. In August of that same year, Kentucky enrolled &lt;a href=\"Nate%20Northington\"&gt;Nate Northington&lt;/a&gt; and Greg Page on football scholarships, and Vanderbilt enrolled Godfrey Dillard and &lt;a href=\"Perry%20Wallace\"&gt;Perry Wallace&lt;/a&gt; on basketball scholarships. At the time, the NCAA did not allow freshmen to compete on varsity teams, which meant that these pioneers could not play until 1967. Page died from complications of a spinal cord injury suffered during a football practice before ever playing a game, while Dillard suffered a career-altering injury before getting a chance to play for Vanderbilt's varsity and transferred to &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Michigan%20Eagles%20men%27s%20basketball\"&gt;Eastern Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining two both played in the 1967\u201368 school year. Northington made his overall debut against &lt;a href=\"1967%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20football%20team\"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; on September 23, 1967 and his SEC debut against Ole Miss the following week on September 30 (the day after Page's death), while Wallace made his varsity debut later that year.\n1990 expansion.\nIn 1990, the SEC expanded from ten to twelve member universities with the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Arkansas%20Razorbacks\"&gt;Arkansas Razorbacks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"South%20Carolina%20Gamecocks\"&gt;South Carolina Gamecocks&lt;/a&gt;. The two new members began SEC competition with the 1991\u20131992 basketball season.\nAt the same time, the SEC organized competition for some sports into two divisions. The Western Division comprised six of the seven member schools in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;Central Time Zone&lt;/a&gt;, while the Eastern Division comprised the five member schools in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;Eastern Time Zone&lt;/a&gt; plus Vanderbilt, which is in the Central Time Zone but was placed in the Eastern Division to preserve its rivalry with Tennessee. Initially, the divisional format was used in football, baseball, and men's basketball. The divisional format was dropped for men's basketball following the 2011\u20132012 season.\nFollowing expansion, the SEC was the first conference to receive permission from the NCAA to sponsor an annual &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;football championship game&lt;/a&gt; that did not count against NCAA limits on regular-season contests, featuring the winners of the conference's Eastern and Western divisions. The &lt;a href=\"1992%20SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1993%20SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt; championship games were held at &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Field\"&gt;Legion Field&lt;/a&gt; in Birmingham, and all championship games from &lt;a href=\"1994%20SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt; onward have been held in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;\u2014first at the &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Dome\"&gt;Georgia Dome&lt;/a&gt; until its closure and demolition after the 2016 season, and since 2017 at &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz%20Stadium\"&gt;Mercedes-Benz Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.\n2012 expansion.\nOn September 25, 2011, the SEC Presidents and Chancellors, acting unanimously, announced that &lt;a href=\"Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University\"&gt;Texas A&amp;M University&lt;/a&gt; would join the SEC effective July 1, 2012, to begin competition in nineteen of the twenty sports sponsored by the SEC during the 2012\u201313 academic year. On November 6, 2011, the SEC commissioner announced that the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Missouri\"&gt;University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt; would also join the SEC on July 1, 2012. For football, Texas A&amp;M was scheduled to compete in the Western Division, and Missouri in the Eastern Division. Texas A&amp;M and Missouri both left the &lt;a href=\"Big%2012%20Conference\"&gt;Big 12 Conference&lt;/a&gt;.\n2020s expansion.\nOn July 27, 2021, &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Oklahoma\"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; formally notified the SEC they were seeking \"an invitation for membership\" beginning at the latest July 1, 2025. In a joint letter, which was made public, Texas president Jay Hartzell and Oklahoma president Joseph Harroz Jr. wrote, \"We believe that there would be mutual benefit to the Universities on the one hand, and the SEC on the other hand, for the Universities to become members of the SEC.\" On July 29, 2021, the presidents of the current 14 schools of the SEC voted unanimously to extend an offer of admission to Oklahoma and Texas. The boards of regents for both institutions on July 30, 2021, accepted conference membership.\nCommissioners.\nThe office of Commissioner was created in 1940.\nMembership timeline.\n \nAcademics and SECU.\nFormation of SECU and SEC academic network.\nIn 2005, the member institutions of the Southeastern Conference formed the SEC Academic Consortium (SECAC), a collaborative endeavor designed to promote research, scholarship, and achievement amongst the universities.\nIn 2011, the SEC Academic Consortium was relocated to the SEC headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Birmingham, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, from its original home on the campus of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Arkansas\"&gt;University of Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fayetteville%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;Fayetteville, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, and was renamed SECU. The SECU rebranded its mission to better serve as a means through which the collaborative academic endeavors and achievements of Southeastern Conference universities would be promoted and advanced. The SECU's goals included highlighting the endeavors and achievements of SEC &lt;a href=\"Faculty%20%28academic%20staff%29\"&gt;faculty&lt;/a&gt;, students and its universities; advancing the academic reputation of SEC universities; identifying and preparing future leaders for high-level service in &lt;a href=\"academia\"&gt;academia&lt;/a&gt;; increasing the amount and type of &lt;a href=\"study%20abroad\"&gt;study abroad&lt;/a&gt; opportunities available for students; and providing opportunities for collaboration among SEC university personnel. The &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference\"&gt;Big Ten Conference&lt;/a&gt; has a similar program called the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Academic%20Alliance\"&gt;Big Ten Academic Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe SEC Symposium component of SECU was crafted by &lt;a href=\"Vanderbilt%20University\"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt; Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20S.%20Zeppos\"&gt;Nicholas S. Zeppos&lt;/a&gt;, who at the time was the Vice President of the SEC Executive Committee and liaison to SECU. In an interview with Dr. Zeppos about the formation of the SECU he noted, \"that the member institutions of the Southeastern Conference are committed to a shared mission of fostering research, scholarship, and achievement. The SEC Symposium represents a platform to connect, collaborate and promote a productive dialogue that will span disciplinary and institutional boundaries and allow us to work together for the betterment of society.\"\nThe SEC Academic Network was created in 2009 in partnership with &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;. The SEC Academic Network was an online library of institutionally produced videos featuring academic initiatives and stories from all Southeastern Conference institutions. The SEC Academic Network was officially merged into the SECU operation.\nAssociation of American Universities.\nFour SEC institutions are members of the prestigious &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20American%20Universities\"&gt;Association of American Universities&lt;/a&gt;: Florida, Missouri, Texas A&amp;M and Vanderbilt. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9312%20Southeastern%20Conference%20realignment\"&gt;addition of Missouri and Texas A&amp;M&lt;/a&gt; from the Big 12, the SEC had the fewest AAU members among Power Five conferences. The Big12 Conference had seven AAU members through the 2010\u201311 school year, but four of these schools &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9313%20Big%2012%20Conference%20realignment\"&gt;left the conference&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 and 2012\u2014Nebraska for the Big Ten in &lt;a href=\"2010%E2%80%9314%20Big%20Ten%20Conference%20realignment\"&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt; (a move that took effect shortly after that school was expelled from the AAU), Colorado for the Pac-12 in 2012, and Missouri and Texas A&amp;M for the SEC in 2012, leaving that conference with three AAU members. Once Texas joins, the SEC will have five AAU members to the Big 12's two.\nSpending and revenue.\nTotal revenue includes ticket sales, contributions and donations, rights/licensing, student fees, school funds, and all other sources including TV income, camp income, food, and novelties. Total expenses includes coaching/staff, scholarships, buildings/grounds, maintenance, utilities and rental fees, and all other costs including recruiting, team travel, equipment and uniforms, conference dues, and insurance costs.\nFuture members in gray.\nKey personnel.\nFuture members in gray.\nFacilities.\nFuture members in gray.\nSports.\nThe Southeastern Conference sponsors championship competition in nine men's and twelve women's NCAA sanctioned sports. Under SEC conference rules reflecting the large number of male scholarship participants in football and attempting to address &lt;a href=\"gender%20equity\"&gt;gender equity&lt;/a&gt; concerns (see also &lt;a href=\"Title%20IX\"&gt;Title IX&lt;/a&gt;), each member institution is required to provide two more women's varsity sports than men's. A similar rule was recently adopted by the NCAA for all of DivisionI.\nMen's sponsored sports by school.\nMen's varsity sports not sponsored by the Southeastern Conference which are played by SEC schools (future members in gray):\nWomen's sponsored sports by school.\nWomen's varsity sports not sponsored by the Southeastern Conference which are played by SEC schools (future members in gray):\nCurrent champions.\nSource: SECSports.com.\nFootball.\n \"For the current season, see &lt;a href=\"2021%20Southeastern%20Conference%20football%20season\"&gt;2021 Southeastern Conference football season&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nScheduling.\nSEC teams did not play a uniform number of conference games until 1974. Prior to that, the number of conference games teams played ranged from four to eight, but most played a 6- or 7-game schedule. The league adopted a uniform 6-game schedule from 1974 to 1987, and added a seventh conference game from 1988 to 1991. Through this period and through the earlier years each SEC school had five permanent opponents, developing some traditional rivalries between schools, and the other games rotated around the other members of the conference.\nAfter expansion to twelve programs in 1992, the SEC went to an 8-game conference schedule, with each team playing the five other teams in their division and three opponents from the other division. The winners of the two divisions would then meet in the &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;SEC Championship Game&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 1992 through 2002, each team had two permanent inter-divisional opponents, allowing many traditional rivalries from the pre-expansion era (such as Florida vs. Auburn, Kentucky vs. LSU, and Vanderbilt vs. Alabama) to continue. However, complaints from some league athletic directors about imbalance in the schedule (for instance, Auburn's two permanent opponents from the East were Florida and Georgia \u2013 two of the SEC's stronger football programs at the time \u2013 while Mississippi State played Kentucky and South Carolina every year) led to the SEC reducing the number of permanent inter-division opponents to one starting in the 2003 season. The TV networks televising SEC games were also pressuring for the change so attractive match-ups between non-traditional opponents would happen twice every five years instead of twice every eight years. With the subsequent expansion to 14 members in 2012, non-permanent cross-division opponents face each other in the regular season twice in a span of twelve years.\nUnder the current format, each school plays a total of eight conference games, consisting of the other six teams in its division, one school from the other division on a rotating basis, and one school from the other division that it plays each year. The permanent cross-division matchups are: &lt;a href=\"Third%20Saturday%20in%20October\"&gt;Alabama\u2013Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Line%20Rivalry\"&gt;Arkansas\u2013Missouri&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Deep%20South%27s%20Oldest%20Rivalry\"&gt;Auburn\u2013Georgia&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Florida%E2%80%93LSU%20football%20rivalry\"&gt;LSU\u2013Florida&lt;/a&gt;; Mississippi State\u2013Kentucky; &lt;a href=\"Ole%20Miss%E2%80%93Vanderbilt%20football%20rivalry\"&gt;Ole Miss\u2013Vanderbilt&lt;/a&gt;; Texas A&amp;M\u2013South Carolina.\nThe current scheduling arrangement was originally set to expire after the 2015 season, but the SEC presidents voted 10\u20134 in April 2014 to keep the current format for an additional six to eight seasons beyond 2015. Additionally, since 2016, SEC teams have been required to schedule at least one opponent each season from the other so-called &lt;a href=\"Power%20Five%20conferences\"&gt;\"Power Five\" conferences&lt;/a&gt; (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, or Pac-12); games against select &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20independent%20schools\"&gt;football independent&lt;/a&gt; schools also qualify, including &lt;a href=\"Army%20Black%20Knights%20football\"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"BYU%20Cougars%20football\"&gt;BYU&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football\"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll-time school records (ranked according to winning percentage).\nThrough end of the 2019 regular season including SEC Championship Game. Records reflect official NCAA results, including any forfeits or win vacating.\nNotes:\nChampionship Game.\nThe &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Championship%20Game\"&gt;SEC Championship Game&lt;/a&gt; pits the SEC Western Division representative against the Eastern Division representative in a game held after the regular season has been completed. The first two SEC Championship football games were held at &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Field\"&gt;Legion Field&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Birmingham%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Birmingham, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1994, it has been played in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;\u2014first at the &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Dome\"&gt;Georgia Dome&lt;/a&gt; through 2016, and since 2017 at its replacement, &lt;a href=\"Mercedes-Benz%20Stadium\"&gt;Mercedes-Benz Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, with the current hosting contract running through 2027. The \"home team\" designation alternates between the division champions, going to the East champion in even-numbered years and the West champion in odd-numbered years. As of 2018, the West leads &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Championship%20Game%23Results\"&gt;15\u201312&lt;/a&gt; in overall wins in the championship game against the East.\nBowl games.\nThe post-season &lt;a href=\"bowl%20game\"&gt;bowl game&lt;/a&gt; tie-ins for the SEC for the 2014\u20132019 seasons are:\nPayout is per team for the 2014 season; if different for opposing conference, payout for the SEC team is shown. Each conference member, irrespective of bowl participation, also receives an equal split of a payout to the SEC conference.\n^ The Sugar Bowl is contractually obligated to select the SEC champion if that team is not participating in the College Football Playoff. In years where the champion is unavailable the Playoff Committee will assign another SEC team to participate in the Sugar. Alternatively, in years where the Sugar hosts a playoff game the SEC Champion will be sent to the Fiesta, Cotton, or Peach Bowl if not selected for the playoff.\n\u2020 The Big Ten and SEC will be eligible to face the ACC representative in the Orange Bowl at least three out of the eight seasons that it does not host a semifinal for the Playoff over a 12-year span.

The following is a list of active rivalries in the Southeastern Conference with totals &amp; records through the completion of the &lt;a href=\"2021%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season\"&gt;2021 season&lt;/a&gt;.\nMen's basketball.\n \"For the upcoming season, see &lt;a href=\"2021%E2%80%9322%20Southeastern%20Conference%20men%27s%20basketball%20season\"&gt;2021\u201322 Southeastern Conference men's basketball season&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSince the 2012\u201313 season, SEC teams have played an 18-game conference schedule, which includes two games (home and away) against each of three permanent rivals and single games against the remaining twelve teams in the conference. Men's basketball formerly used the East/West divisional alignment for regular-season scheduling and seeding the conference tournament, but it no longer does.\nBefore expansion to 14 teams, the conference schedule was 16 games. Although the divisions were eliminated beginning with the 2011\u201312 season, that season's schedule was still set according to the divisional alignments, with each team facing each team from its own division twice and each team from the opposite division once. As part of the proposal by SEC head coaches that led to the scrapping of the divisional structure, a task force of four coaches and four athletic directors was set to discuss future conference scheduling. At that time, options included a revamped 16-game schedule, an 18-game schedule, or a full double round-robin of 22 conference games. However, these discussions came before Texas A&amp;M and Missouri were announced in late 2011 as incoming members for the 2012\u201313 season, which required a format that could support 14 teams rather than twelve.\nAt the 2012 SEC spring meetings, league athletic directors adopted an 18-game conference schedule. Each school had one permanent opponent that it played home and away every season, and faced four other opponents in a home-and-home series during a given season, and then the remaining teams one each (four home, four away). The permanent opponents were Alabama-Auburn, Arkansas-Missouri, Florida-Kentucky, Georgia-South Carolina, LSU-Texas A&amp;M, Ole Miss-Mississippi State, and Tennessee-Vanderbilt. The home-and-home opponents, apart from the permanent opponent, rotated each season.\nThe 2014 SEC spring meetings saw a further change to the scheduling format. While the athletic directors voted to stay with an 18-game conference schedule, they increased the number of permanent opponents for each school from one to three. Each school retained its permanent opponent from the 2012\u20132014 period while adding two others.\nFrom 1966 to 1967, following Tulane's departure, through 1990\u201391, the year prior to the addition of Arkansas and South Carolina, teams played a double round-robin, 18-game conference schedule. No team was undefeated in this period, though three teams went 17\u20131 (Kentucky in 1970 and 1986, LSU in 1981). During the period from 1992 to 2012 when the league slate was 16 games, Kentucky went undefeated in SEC play in 1996, 2003, and 2012 (although only the 2003 team went on to win the conference tournament).\nSince the return to an 18-game conference schedule following the 2012 conference expansion, two teams have gone undefeated in SEC play: Florida in 2013\u201314 and Kentucky in 2014\u201315.\nScheduling partners.\nThe table below lists each school's permanent men's basketball-only scheduling partners beginning in 2014\u201315.\nBasketball tournament.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"SEC%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;SEC Men's Basketball Tournament&lt;/a&gt;\" (also known simply as the \"&lt;a href=\"SEC%20Tournament\"&gt;SEC Tournament&lt;/a&gt;\") is the competition that determines the SEC's automatic bid to the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Championship\"&gt;NCAA men's basketball tournament&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, it does not determine the SEC conference champion in men's basketball\u2014the conference has awarded its championship to the team(s) with the best regular-season record since the 1950\u201351 season. It is a single-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season records.\nWith the expansion to 14 members in 2012, the 2013 tournament was the first with a new format covering five days. The teams seeded eleven through fourteen play on the first day, with the winners advancing to play the No.5 and No.6 seeds on Thursday. The top four teams receive a \"double bye\" and do not play until the quarterfinals on Friday.\nAs of the current 2020\u201321 season, the tournament has most often been held at two venues that have each hosted twelve times. &lt;a href=\"Louisville%20Gardens\"&gt;Louisville Gardens&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Louisville%2C%20Kentucky\"&gt;Louisville, Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; served as the regular host from 1941 until the tournament was discontinued after the 1952 edition. The &lt;a href=\"Georgia%20Dome\"&gt;Georgia Dome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Atlanta\"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; first hosted the tournament in 1995 and most recently hosted in 2014. &lt;a href=\"Bridgestone%20Arena\"&gt;Bridgestone Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nashville%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Nashville, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; is now the regular host, with that venue hosting the tournament from 2015 through 2025, except in 2018 and 2022 (years in which it will instead host the SEC women's basketball tournament). Sometimes, the tournament will take place at the &lt;a href=\"Smoothie%20King%20Center\"&gt;Smoothie King Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Orleans\"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Amalie%20Arena\"&gt;Amalie Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tampa%2C%20Florida\"&gt;Tampa, Florida&lt;/a&gt;. The 2018 tournament was held at Scottrade Center, now &lt;a href=\"Enterprise%20Center\"&gt;Enterprise Center&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis\"&gt;St. Louis, Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, and the 2022 tournament will be at Amalie Arena.\nPrior to moving to the Georgia Dome, the tournament (during its modern, post-1979 era) was most often contested at the venue now known as &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Arena\"&gt;Legacy Arena&lt;/a&gt; in Birmingham, Alabama, home of the SEC's headquarters and centrally located prior to the addition of Arkansas and South Carolina. Other sites to host include on-campus arenas at LSU, Tennessee and Vanderbilt; &lt;a href=\"Rupp%20Arena\"&gt;Rupp Arena&lt;/a&gt; in Lexington; and the &lt;a href=\"Orlando%20Arena\"&gt;Orlando Arena&lt;/a&gt;.\nNCAA tournament champions, runners-up and locations.\n\"\u2020 denotes overtime games. Multiple \u2020's indicate more than one overtime.\"\nAwards.\nThe &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Player%20of%20the%20Year\"&gt;SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year&lt;/a&gt; is awarded to the player who has proven himself, throughout the season, to be the most exceptional talent in the Southeastern Conference. Various other awards, such as the best tournament player in the &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;SEC Tournament&lt;/a&gt; and all conference honors are given out throughout the year.\nBaseball.\nSchools play a 30-game league schedule (10 three-game series). Since 1996, schools have played all five schools within their division and five schools from the opposite division. Before the addition of Missouri and Texas A&amp;M in advance of the 2013 season, schools missed only one opponent from the opposite division in a given season; each school now misses three opponents from the opposite division.\nSince 1990, the SEC has become the most successful conference on the college baseball diamond. That year, Georgia captured the conference's first national championship at the &lt;a href=\"College%20World%20Series\"&gt;College World Series&lt;/a&gt;. Following that, LSU won six of the next 19 titles, including five of ten between 1991 and 2000 and its sixth title in 2009. This was followed by South Carolina winning back-to-back titles in 2010 and 2011, Vanderbilt winning its first title in 2014, Florida winning its first title in 2017, Vanderbilt winning again in 2019, and Mississippi State claiming its first title in 2021. During that same span, 10 teams have also been runners-up at the CWS. The CWS final series has featured two SEC teams in 1997, 2011, 2017, and 2021. The only current SEC member that has never appeared in the CWS is &lt;a href=\"Kentucky%20Wildcats%20baseball\"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;; every other current member has appeared at least 5 times. Among other current SEC members, only &lt;a href=\"Missouri%20Tigers%20baseball\"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; has not appeared in the CWS while a member of the SEC (and has yet to make the NCAA tournament as an SEC member), although it made six CWS appearances in the 1950s and 1960s while in the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Eight%20Conference\"&gt;Big Eight Conference&lt;/a&gt;. Both Georgia Tech and Tulane have made appearances in the CWS after leaving the SEC. Future SEC member Texas leads all schools in CWS appearances with 37, and its 6 titles tie the Longhorns with LSU for the second-most championships. Another future member, Oklahoma, has two titles from 10 CWS appearances.\nSEC teams have also become leaders in total and average attendance over the years. In 2010 five of the top six drawing programs hailed from the SEC. Six more teams placed in the top 35 nationally.\nThe NCAA automatic berth is given to the winner of the SEC Baseball Tournament, which was first started in 1977. It is a double-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season records. Since 1998, the tournament has been held at &lt;a href=\"Hoover%20Metropolitan%20Stadium\"&gt;Hoover Metropolitan Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hoover%2C%20Alabama\"&gt;Hoover, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; and contested under the format used at the &lt;a href=\"College%20World%20Series\"&gt;College World Series&lt;/a&gt; from 1988 through 2002, with two four-team brackets leading to a single championship game. The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20Baseball%20Championship\"&gt;NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament&lt;/a&gt;.\nSEC presidents and athletic directors voted to expand the SEC Tournament to ten teams starting in 2012. The division winners received a bye on the first day of competition, and the tournament became single-elimination after the field is pared to four teams.\nWith the addition of Missouri and Texas A&amp;M for the 2013 baseball season, the tournament was expanded to 12 teams. The top four seeds receive a bye on the first day, with seeds 5\u201312 playing single elimination. The tournament is double-elimination for the next three days, then reverts to single elimination when four teams are remaining.\nIn addition to the winner of the SEC Baseball Tournament, the Southeastern Conference usually gets several at-large bids to the NCAA Tournament. Many teams have qualified for the NCAA Tournament despite failing to win a game in the SEC Tournament. One of those, Mississippi State, went 0\u20132 in the 2007 SEC Tournament, but reached the College World Series in 2007.\nCollege World Series champions, runners-up and scores.\nNote: Teams in bold are current SEC members who advanced to the CWS while in the conference. Teams in bold italics are current SEC members who were either in another conference or an independent at the time of their appearance.\nCollege World Series appearances.\nFuture members in gray.\nRivalries.\nSeveral baseball rivalries have developed in the SEC:\nWomen's basketball.\nThe SEC has historically been a strong conference in women's basketball. Since the 2009\u201310 season, teams have played a 16-game conference schedule with a single league table; prior to that time the conference schedule was 14 games, again in a single table. Like SEC men's basketball, women's basketball used the divisional alignment for scheduling purposes through the 2011\u201312 season; however, the women's scheduling format was significantly different from the men's. Each team played home-and-home games against five schools\u2014one permanent opponent, two teams from the same division, and two teams from the opposite division; the non-permanent home-and-home opponents rotated every two years. The remaining games were single games against the six other schools in the conference, with three at home and three away.\nThe league voted to keep a 16-game league schedule even after the addition of Missouri and Texas A&amp;M. Arkansas and LSU are no longer permanent opponents, with the Razorbacks picking up Missouri and the Lady Tigers picking up Texas A&amp;M. The other permanent opponents are the same as men's basketball, except for Florida-Georgia and Kentucky-South Carolina (both pairs had been permanent women's basketball opponents before the 2012 expansion). Each school plays two others home-and-home during a given season and the other ten once each. The divisional alignments no longer play any role in scheduling.\nThe recent history of SEC women's basketball is dominated by &lt;a href=\"Tennessee%20Lady%20Volunteers%20basketball\"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;, who have won regular season and/or conference tournament championships in 25 of the last 31 seasons, as well as eight national championships since 1987. The South Carolina Gamecocks have also had success, winning four straight SEC women's championships between 2015 and 2018, as well as a 2017 national title. In the 28 seasons the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20Women%27s%20Basketball%20Championship\"&gt;NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship&lt;/a&gt; has been held, SEC schools have reached the Final Four 32 times, more than twice as often as any other conference.\nBasketball tournament.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"SEC%20Women%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament\"&gt;SEC Women's Basketball Tournament&lt;/a&gt;\" is currently held a week before the men's basketball tournament. Like the men's version, it is a single-elimination tournament involving all conference members, with seeding based on regular season records. With the expansion to 14 schools, the bottom four teams in the conference standings play opening-round games, and the top four receive \"double byes\" into the quarterfinals. The winner earns the conference's automatic bid to the &lt;a href=\"NCAA%20Division%20I%20Women%27s%20Basketball%20Championship\"&gt;NCAA women's basketball tournament&lt;/a&gt;. Also paralleling the men's tournament, the women's tournament does not determine the SEC champion; that honor has been awarded based on regular-season record since the 1985\u201386 season.\nThe tournament, inaugurated in 1980, was originally held on campus sites; the first tournament to take place at a neutral site was in 1987. The two most frequent sites for the tournament have been &lt;a href=\"McKenzie%20Arena\"&gt;McKenzie Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chattanooga%2C%20Tennessee\"&gt;Chattanooga, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; (seven times) and the &lt;a href=\"Albany%20Civic%20Center\"&gt;Albany Civic Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Albany%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Albany, Georgia&lt;/a&gt; (six times); however, the tournament was last played in Albany in 1992 and Chattanooga in 2000. Because demand for women's tournament tickets is generally lower than for the men's tournament, it is typically played in a smaller venue than the men's tournament in the same season. The most frequent venues since 2000 have been Bridgestone Arena in Nashville (five times), &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Energy%20Arena\"&gt;Infinite Energy Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duluth%2C%20Georgia\"&gt;Duluth, Georgia&lt;/a&gt; (four), and &lt;a href=\"Simmons%20Bank%20Arena\"&gt;Simmons Bank Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"North%20Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas\"&gt;North Little Rock, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; (four).\nNCAA tournament champions, runners-up and locations.\n\"\u2020 denotes overtime games. Multiple \u2020's indicate more than one overtime.\"\nOther sports.\nBesides football, basketball, and baseball, there are a number of other sports in which the Southeastern Conference actively competes.\nNational team championships.\nSince the SEC's founding in December 1932, the varsity athletic teams of its current 14 members have won over 200 national team sports championships.\nThe following is the list of the national team championships claimed by current SEC member schools, including those tournament championships currently or formerly sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (NCAA). The NCAA has never sponsored a tournament championship for major college football, the championship game for which is currently part of the &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Playoff\"&gt;College Football Playoff&lt;/a&gt; (CFP) system. Prior to 1992, championships for major college football were determined by a \"consensus\" of major polling services, including the &lt;a href=\"AP%20Poll\"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"United%20Press%20International\"&gt;United Press International&lt;/a&gt; college football polls. Recognized &lt;a href=\"Association%20for%20Intercollegiate%20Athletics%20for%20Women%20championships\"&gt;women's championships&lt;/a&gt; from 1972 to 1982 were administered by the &lt;a href=\"Association%20for%20Intercollegiate%20Athletics%20for%20Women\"&gt;Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women&lt;/a&gt; (AIAW), not the NCAA. There was a one-year overlap period during the 1981\u201382 school year, when both the AIAW and the NCAA operated women's championship tournaments; since 1982, only the NCAA has sponsored women's championship tournaments. National equestrian tournament championships are currently sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Equestrian%20Association\"&gt;National Collegiate Equestrian Association&lt;/a&gt; (NCEA), not the NCAA. Those national championships dating from before 1933 predate the founding of the SEC in December 1932; championships won by Arkansas and South Carolina before the 1992\u201393 school year predate their membership in the SEC; championships won by Missouri and Texas A&amp;M before the 2012\u201313 school year predate their membership in the SEC.\n&lt;a href=\"College%20football%20national%20championships%20in%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS\"&gt;Football&lt;/a&gt;

The following totals include national team championships sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (NCAA) from 1906 to present, the &lt;a href=\"Association%20for%20Intercollegiate%20Athletics%20for%20Women\"&gt;Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women&lt;/a&gt; (AIAW) from 1972 to 1982, and, in football, the &lt;a href=\"Bowl%20Alliance\"&gt;Bowl Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bowl%20Coalition\"&gt;Bowl Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bowl%20Championship%20Series\"&gt;Bowl Championship Series&lt;/a&gt; (BCS) and &lt;a href=\"College%20Football%20Playoff\"&gt;College Football Playoff&lt;/a&gt; (CFP) since 1992, as well as consensus national championships determined by the major football polls prior to 1992.\nNCAA and AIAW national tournament team titles won by current SEC institutions.\nThe following totals include national team tournament championships sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association\"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt; (NCAA) from 1906 to the present and the &lt;a href=\"Association%20for%20Intercollegiate%20Athletics%20for%20Women\"&gt;Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women&lt;/a&gt; (AIAW) from 1972 to 1982. The NCAA did not sponsor tournament championships in women's sports before the 1981\u201382 academic year, and the NCAA has never sponsored a national championship playoff or tournament in major college football. To date, the fourteen members of the SEC have won 216 NCAA and four AIAW championships, including:\nTelevision and radio contracts.\nThe SEC televises football games across various networks during the fall. SEC coverage is primarily provided by &lt;a href=\"CBS\"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; family of networks, which includes ESPN, &lt;a href=\"ESPN2\"&gt;ESPN2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ESPNU\"&gt;ESPNU&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ESPN%20on%20ABC\"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Sports%20Networks\"&gt;Fox Sports Networks&lt;/a&gt; also has rights to air seven live football games over the course of the season.\nESPN reported paying $2.25 billion for broadcast rights of SEC football games beginning in the 2009 season and running through fiscal year 2025.\nGames scheduled for airing are generally picked two weeks before they occur, with a few matches that are selected by CBS and ESPN prior to the season.\nCBS has the first pick for a game and selects the highest-profile game to broadcast to a national, over-the-air audience. The CBS game is usually broadcast at 3:30 Eastern. Some weekends, CBS will air a doubleheader of SEC games. CBS also has the rights for the SEC Championship Game.\nESPN will air several SEC games each week among its various channels, with Saturday time slots generally at 12:00 ET, 7:00 ET, and 7:45 ET, and some SEC games will be shown on Thursday nights. In previous years, &lt;a href=\"Raycom%20Sports\"&gt;Raycom Sports&lt;/a&gt; (and before it, Jefferson-Pilot/Lincoln Financial Sports) syndicated regional coverage for an SEC game of the week at 12:30 ET, but the new contract replaced it with a new ESPN-produced syndication package, the &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Network\"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/a&gt;whose football games kickoff at 12:21 ET.\nThe currently scheduled Fox Sports Net games are set for 7:00 ET.\nFor games not selected by any broadcast provider, certain schools may offer regional pay-per-view.\nAs of 2008, all SEC schools are affiliated with XM Radio, offering their radio broadcasts to an audience on XM. According to SiriusXM, the SEC will not be included as part of the \"Best of XM\" package deal for Sirius customers.\nSEC Radio 24/7 on SiriusXM radio channel 374 on some radio and online\n2008 television contract.\nDuring the 2007\u20132008 fiscal year review meeting, there was discussion among SEC leadership about the possibility of starting a TV network dedicated to its conference, much in the same way the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20West%20Conference\"&gt;Mountain West Conference&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Conference\"&gt;Big Ten Conference&lt;/a&gt; have done with &lt;a href=\"MountainWest%20Sports%20Network\"&gt;the mtn.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Ten%20Network\"&gt;Big Ten Network&lt;/a&gt;s, respectively. A decision was made to postpone the decision until at least the following year.\nIn August 2008, the SEC announced an unprecedented 15-year television contract with CBS worth an estimated $55 million a year. This continues the relationship the SEC already has with CBS, which puts the SEC in the unique position as the only conference to have its own exclusive national television network of the four major over-the-air broadcast networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox) to display the SEC's events.\nIn the same month, the league also announced another landmark television contract with ESPN worth $2.25 billion or $150 million a year for the life of the contract, which is for fifteen years. It is the longest and wealthiest contract among all television deals among the major conferences. With these contracts, the SEC had, at the time of the deal, the richest television deals in the country outside the Big Ten and helped make the SEC one of the most nationally televised and visible conferences in the country with the coverage that was provided by these contracts.\n2014 SEC Network launch.\nThe &lt;a href=\"SEC%20Network\"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/a&gt; is a television and multimedia network that features exclusively Southeastern Conference content through a partnership between &lt;a href=\"ESPN\"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; and the SEC. The network launched on August 14, 2014, with the first live football game scheduled for two weeks later between Texas A&amp;M and South Carolina on Thursday, August 28 in Columbia, South Carolina\nThe network is part of a deal between the Southeastern Conference and ESPN which is a 20-year agreement, beginning in August 2014 and running through 2034. The agreement served to create and operate a new multiplatform television network and accompanying digital platform in the hope of increasing revenue for member institutions and expanding the reach of the Southeastern Conference.\nConference champions.\nThe \"Southeastern Conference\" sponsors nine men's sports and twelve women's sports, and awards a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Southeastern%20Conference%20champions\"&gt;conference championship&lt;/a&gt; in every one of them."
