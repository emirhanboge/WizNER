She was launched at &lt;a href=\"Chatham%20Dockyard\"&gt;Chatham Dockyard&lt;/a&gt; on 22 November 1893, the first of the class to be completed.

With a length overall of , a beam of and a displacement of 1,070 tons, these torpedo gunboats were not small ships by the standard of the time; they were larger than the majority of World War I destroyers. \"Dryad\" was engined by Maudslay, Sons &amp; Field with two sets of vertical triple-expansion steam engines, two locomotive-type boilers, and twin screws. This layout produced , giving her a speed of . She carried between 100 and 160 tons of coal and was manned by 120 sailors and officers.\nArmament.\nThe armament when built comprised two &lt;a href=\"QF%204.7%20inch%20Gun%20Mk%20I%20-%20IV\"&gt;QF guns&lt;/a&gt;, four &lt;a href=\"QF%206-pounder%20Hotchkiss\"&gt;6-pounder&lt;/a&gt; guns and a single 5-barrelled Nordenfelt machine gun. Her primary weapon was five &lt;a href=\"British%2018%20inch%20torpedo\"&gt;18-inch (450-mm) torpedo tubes&lt;/a&gt;, with two reloads. On conversion to a minesweeper in 1914 two of the five torpedoes were removed.\nService history.\nMediterranean service.\n\"Dryad\" deployed to &lt;a href=\"Crete\"&gt;Crete&lt;/a&gt; in February 1897 to operate as part of the &lt;a href=\"International%20Squadron%20%28Crete%20intervention%2C%201897-1898%29\"&gt;International Squadron&lt;/a&gt;, a multinational force made up of ships of the &lt;a href=\"Austro-Hungarian%20Navy\"&gt;Austro-Hungarian Navy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"French%20Navy\"&gt;French Navy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20German%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial German Navy&lt;/a&gt;, Italian Royal Navy (\"&lt;a href=\"Regia%20Marina\"&gt;Regia Marina&lt;/a&gt;\"), &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Russian%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Russian Navy&lt;/a&gt;, and Royal Navy that intervened in the 1897-1898 Greek uprising on Crete against rule by the &lt;a href=\"Ottoman%20Empire\"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt;.
