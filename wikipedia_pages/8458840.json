    "text": "Henry Armstrong Miller (born July 16, 1969) is a former &lt;a href=\"sumo\"&gt;sumo&lt;/a&gt; wrestler, raised in &lt;a href=\"St.%20Louis\"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;, Missouri, who competed under the \"&lt;a href=\"shikona\"&gt;shikona&lt;/a&gt;\" . The first wrestler from the &lt;a href=\"US%20mainland\"&gt;US mainland&lt;/a&gt; to reach the top \"&lt;a href=\"makuuchi\"&gt;makuuchi&lt;/a&gt;\" division, he made his professional debut in 1988 and reached a highest rank of \"&lt;a href=\"maegashira\"&gt;maegashira&lt;/a&gt;\" 12 before retiring in 2003. He last competed in MMA as recently as 2013, losing to &lt;a href=\"Kazuhiro%20Nakamura\"&gt;Kazuhiro Nakamura&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life.\nHe was born in &lt;a href=\"Tachikawa%2C%20Tokyo\"&gt;Tachikawa, Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, Japan, the son of a Japanese mother and African-American father. He was born on the same day that the &lt;a href=\"Apollo%2011\"&gt;Apollo 11&lt;/a&gt; lunar mission left Earth and his middle name was given to him by his father in honor of &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Armstrong\"&gt;Neil Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;. He lived on &lt;a href=\"Yokota%20Air%20Base\"&gt;Yokota Air Base&lt;/a&gt; until the age of six, when he moved with his family to St Louis, Missouri. He grew up in &lt;a href=\"Ferguson%2C%20Missouri\"&gt;Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;. His dream of becoming a professional &lt;a href=\"American%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; player was ended by a knee injury in his senior year of high school, but he had also been &lt;a href=\"wrestling\"&gt;wrestling&lt;/a&gt; since elementary school and he had qualified for the state championships. After graduating in 1987 he returned to Japan to try professional sumo.\nSumo career.\nHe joined the &lt;a href=\"Tomozuna%20stable\"&gt;Tomozuna stable&lt;/a&gt; of wrestlers, also the home of future \"&lt;a href=\"Makuuchi%23%C5%8Czeki\"&gt;ozeki&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Kaio%20Hiroyuki\"&gt;Kaio&lt;/a&gt;. He was given the \"&lt;a href=\"shikona\"&gt;shikona&lt;/a&gt;\" of Sentory\u016b, meaning \"fighting war dragon\" but also a &lt;a href=\"play%20on%20words\"&gt;play on words&lt;/a&gt; for his hometown of St. Louis. He was relatively small at 174\u00a0cm and 94\u00a0kg when he made his debut in July 1988. He won the \"&lt;a href=\"yusho\"&gt;yusho&lt;/a&gt;\" or tournament championship in his first official tournament in the \"&lt;a href=\"jonokuchi\"&gt;jonokuchi&lt;/a&gt;\" division in September 1988, defeating a fellow American, Shinnishiki from &lt;a href=\"Los%20Angeles\"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. In 1991 he reached \"&lt;a href=\"makushita\"&gt;makushita&lt;/a&gt;\" for the first time but injury problems meant he did not establish himself in the division until 1993. In November 1994 he became a \"&lt;a href=\"sekitori\"&gt;sekitori&lt;/a&gt;\" for the first time but lasted only two tournaments in the \"&lt;a href=\"j%C5%ABry%C5%8D\"&gt;j\u016bry\u014d&lt;/a&gt;\" division before being demoted.\nIt took Sentory\u016b more than four years of hard toil in the unsalaried \"makushita\" division (including a change of name to Kaishinzan in 1997) before he could win promotion back to the second division in July 1999, after an unbeaten 7-0 \"yusho\" in May. His final day victory over the former amateur champion Kototamiya (the future ozeki &lt;a href=\"Kotomitsuki\"&gt;Kotomitsuki&lt;/a&gt;) was regarded as one of the high points of his career.\nAfter reverting to the name Sentory\u016b, a strong 13-2 record in March 2000 sent him to the top of the \"j\u016bry\u014d\" division. With an 8-7 mark in May 2000, he finally achieved his goal of promotion to the top \"&lt;a href=\"makuuchi\"&gt;makuuchi&lt;/a&gt;\" division in July. It had taken him 72 tournaments from his professional debut to reach \"makuuchi\", which is the slowest amongst foreign-born wrestlers.\nSentory\u016b came through with a winning record of 8-7 in his debut but was then demoted after only recording a 5-10 score in September 2000. He had to withdraw from the following tournament in November and missed the January 2001 \"basho\". Nevertheless, he managed to hold his own in \"j\u016bry\u014d\" and had one more visit to the top division in January 2002. However, he suffered a serious injury and was unable to compete in the March and May 2002 tournaments, falling all the way back to \"makushita\". He refused to give up and fought his way back to \"sekitori\" status in September 2003, becoming the fifth oldest wrestler to return to \"j\u016bry\u014d\" in the postwar era at 34 years, 1 month. However, another injury convinced him to retire at the end of the year, in the same tournament as &lt;a href=\"Musashimaru\"&gt;Musashimaru&lt;/a&gt;. His great fighting spirit, despite all his injuries, won him many admirers. He had spent 20 tournaments as a \"sekitori\", by far the most successful career by anyone from the &lt;a href=\"contiguous%20United%20States\"&gt;contiguous United States&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe defeated &lt;a href=\"Asash%C5%8Dry%C5%AB%20Akinori\"&gt;Asash\u014dry\u016b&lt;/a&gt; in their only meeting in November 2000, when both were in the \"j\u016bry\u014d\" division. He also had three wins over Kotomitsuki in their four meetings.\nFighting style.\nSentory\u016b favoured pushing and thrusting &lt;a href=\"kimarite\"&gt;techniques&lt;/a&gt;, winning most of his matches by \"oshi dashi\" (push out), \"hatakikomi\" (slap down) or \"hikiotoshi\" (pull down).\nMixed martial arts and kickboxing career.\nSince his retirement from sumo, Sentory\u016b tried his luck at &lt;a href=\"mixed%20martial%20arts\"&gt;mixed martial arts&lt;/a&gt;. He was recommended for &lt;a href=\"Pride%20Fighting%20Championships\"&gt;PRIDE&lt;/a&gt; in April 2004 by &lt;a href=\"Chiyotaikai%20Ry%C5%ABji\"&gt;Chiyotaikai Ry\u016bji&lt;/a&gt;, who saw &lt;a href=\"Akebono%20Taro\"&gt;Akebono Taro&lt;/a&gt; make such transition a year before.\nHe has six wins and sixteen losses in his 23 fights to date. He styles himself Henry \"Sentoryu\" Miller. He made an agreement with &lt;a href=\"World%20Victory%20Road\"&gt;World Victory Road&lt;/a&gt; and fought &lt;a href=\"Yoshihiro%20Nakao\"&gt;Yoshihiro Nakao&lt;/a&gt;. On 25 December 2010 he faced Yoichi Babaguchi (former &lt;a href=\"sekiwake\"&gt;sekiwake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wakashoyo\"&gt;Wakashoyo&lt;/a&gt;) in the first ever K-1 kickboxing match between former &lt;a href=\"sekitori\"&gt;sekitori&lt;/a&gt;. There was an edge to the match because Miller blamed Babaguchi for an injury he sustained in a sumo bout between the two in November 1994 (his debut juryo tournament). Miller won the match in the first round.\nSumo career record.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "
