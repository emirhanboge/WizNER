    "text": "H. Grady Spruce High School is a &lt;a href=\"Public%20school%20%28government%20funded%29\"&gt;public school&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Spruce%20Square%20Development%20of%20Southeast%20Dallas\"&gt;Spruce Square Development of Southeast Dallas&lt;/a&gt; in the state of &lt;a href=\"Texas\"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. H. Grady Spruce High School, which covers grades 9\u201312, is a part of the &lt;a href=\"Dallas%20Independent%20School%20District\"&gt;Dallas Independent School District&lt;/a&gt;. Spruce serves several sections of southeast Dallas, including &lt;a href=\"Balch%20Springs\"&gt;Balch Springs&lt;/a&gt;. In 2015, the school was rated \"&lt;a href=\"Texas%20Education%20Agency%20accountability%20ratings%20system\"&gt;Met Standard&lt;/a&gt;\" by the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Education%20Agency\"&gt;Texas Education Agency&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOnce part of Rylie, this unincorporated land was annexed to Dallas in the late '50s and developed into a community most noted for its high school, H. Grady Spruce, which opened in 1963. Spruce replaced &lt;a href=\"Rylie%20High%20School\"&gt;Rylie High School&lt;/a&gt; (which was turned into a &lt;a href=\"junior%20high%20school\"&gt;junior high school&lt;/a&gt; and later a &lt;a href=\"middle%20school\"&gt;middle school&lt;/a&gt; in 1972).\nThe school is named for Henry Grady Spruce, a native of &lt;a href=\"Omen%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Omen, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, who earned degrees from &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Methodist%20University\"&gt;Southern Methodist University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. He devoted much of his 35-year &lt;a href=\"YMCA\"&gt;YMCA&lt;/a&gt; career to youth, including 25 years as director of the Dallas YMCA's Camp Crockett (now Camp Grady Spruce) near &lt;a href=\"Granbury%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Granbury&lt;/a&gt; and the Park Cities YMCA.\nWhen it opened, Spruce's student body reflected the community and was predominately &lt;a href=\"Caucasian%20race\"&gt;Caucasian&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; and with some &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; students and other ethnic groups). Beginning in 1971, Spruce was selected to take part in &lt;a href=\"Desegregation%20busing%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;busing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt; students became a majority in the early 1980s as the demographics of the Pleasant Grove area changed. Starting in the 1990s, Hispanics became the majority.\nFrom 1963\u20131998, the mascot of Spruce High School was the \"Mighty Fighting &lt;a href=\"Apache\"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;s\". In 1998, the \"Apache\" mascot was changed to the Timberwolves.\nOn June 26, 2008, the Dallas ISD board voted to move all 10th and 11th graders from Spruce High School and released all staff from their contracts. As a result, Spruce disbanded all athletic teams during the 2008\u20132009 school year; thus, seniors who participated in athletics were eligible to transfer to other DISD schools.\nFacilities.\nPreviously the school housed the Dallas ISD and &lt;a href=\"Parkland%20Hospital\"&gt;Parkland&lt;/a&gt; Spruce Youth and Family Health Center in temporary buildings. On June 3, 2013, it moved to a site next to Balch Springs Middle School in &lt;a href=\"Balch%20Springs%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Balch Springs&lt;/a&gt; and became the Balch Springs Youth &amp; Family Health Center. It serves disadvantaged children who do not have primary care physicians.\nStatistics.\nDuring the 2011\u201312 school year 90% of the students at H. Grady Spruce High School are economically disadvantaged, 12.9% enroll in special education, 6.7% enroll in gifted and talented programs, and 27.1% are considered \"limited English proficient.\"\nThe ethnic makeup of the school during the 2011-2012 school year was 71% &lt;a href=\"Hispanic\"&gt;Hispanic&lt;/a&gt;, 26.9% &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;Black&lt;/a&gt;, 1.5% &lt;a href=\"White%20people\"&gt;White&lt;/a&gt;, non-Hispanic, less than 1% &lt;a href=\"Asian%20%28people%29\"&gt;Asian&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Islander\"&gt;Pacific Islander&lt;/a&gt;, and less than 1% &lt;a href=\"Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;American Indian&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Alaska%20Natives\"&gt;Alaskan Native&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeeder patterns.\nAs of 2007, E. B. Comstock Middle School feeds into H. Grady Spruce High School.\nThe following elementary schools feed into Comstock and Spruce\nAthletics.\nThe H.Grady Spruce Timberwolves compete in the following sports:"
