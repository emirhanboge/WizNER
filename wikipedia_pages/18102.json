    "text": "In &lt;a href=\"mathematics\"&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, and more specifically in &lt;a href=\"linear%20algebra\"&gt;linear algebra&lt;/a&gt;, a linear map (also called a linear mapping, linear transformation, vector space homomorphism, or in some contexts linear function) is a &lt;a href=\"Map%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;mapping&lt;/a&gt; formula_1 between two &lt;a href=\"vector%20space\"&gt;vector space&lt;/a&gt;s that preserves the operations of &lt;a href=\"vector%20addition\"&gt;vector addition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"scalar%20multiplication\"&gt;scalar multiplication&lt;/a&gt;. The same names and the same definition are also used for the more general case of &lt;a href=\"module%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;modules&lt;/a&gt; over a &lt;a href=\"ring%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;; see &lt;a href=\"Module%20homomorphism\"&gt;Module homomorphism&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a linear map is a &lt;a href=\"bijection\"&gt;bijection&lt;/a&gt; then it is called a . In the case where formula_2, a linear map is called a (linear) \"&lt;a href=\"endomorphism\"&gt;endomorphism&lt;/a&gt;\". Sometimes the term linear operator refers to this case, but the term \"linear operator\" can have different meanings for different conventions: for example, it can be used to emphasize that formula_3 and formula_4 are &lt;a href=\"Real%20number\"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; vector spaces (not necessarily with formula_2), or it can be used to emphasize that formula_3 is a &lt;a href=\"function%20space\"&gt;function space&lt;/a&gt;, which is a common convention in &lt;a href=\"functional%20analysis\"&gt;functional analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes the term \"&lt;a href=\"linear%20function\"&gt;linear function&lt;/a&gt;\" has the same meaning as \"linear map\", while in &lt;a href=\"mathematical%20analysis\"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; it does not.\nA linear map from \"V\" to \"W\" always maps the origin of \"V\" to the origin of \"W\". Moreover, it maps &lt;a href=\"linear%20subspace\"&gt;linear subspace&lt;/a&gt;s in \"V\" onto linear subspaces in \"W\" (possibly of a lower &lt;a href=\"Dimension%20%28vector%20space%29\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;); for example, it maps a &lt;a href=\"Plane%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Origin%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;origin&lt;/a&gt; in \"V\" to either a plane through the origin in \"W\", a &lt;a href=\"Line%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;line&lt;/a&gt; through the origin in \"W\", or just the origin in \"W\". Linear maps can often be represented as &lt;a href=\"matrix%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;matrices&lt;/a&gt;, and simple examples include &lt;a href=\"Rotations%20and%20reflections%20in%20two%20dimensions\"&gt;rotation and reflection linear transformations&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the language of &lt;a href=\"category%20theory\"&gt;category theory&lt;/a&gt;, linear maps are the &lt;a href=\"morphism\"&gt;morphism&lt;/a&gt;s of vector spaces.\nDefinition and first consequences.\nLet formula_3 and formula_4 be vector spaces over the same &lt;a href=\"field%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;field&lt;/a&gt; formula_9. \nA function formula_10 is said to be a \"linear map\" if for any two vectors formula_11 and any scalar formula_12 the following two conditions are satisfied:\nThus, a linear map is said to be \"operation preserving\". In other words, it does not matter whether the linear map is applied before (the right hand sides of the above examples) or after (the left hand sides of the examples) the operations of addition and scalar multiplication.\nBy &lt;a href=\"Addition%23Associativity\"&gt;the associativity of the addition operation&lt;/a&gt; denoted as +, for any vectors formula_15 and scalars formula_16 the following equality holds:\nformula_17\nDenoting the zero elements of the vector spaces formula_3 and formula_4 by formula_20 and formula_21 respectively, it follows that formula_22 Let formula_23 and formula_24 in the equation for homogeneity of degree 1:\nformula_25\nOccasionally, formula_3 and formula_4 can be vector spaces over different fields. It is then necessary to specify which of these ground fields is being used in the definition of \"linear\". If formula_3 and formula_4 are spaces over the same field formula_9 as above, then we talk about formula_9-linear maps. For example, the &lt;a href=\"complex%20conjugate\"&gt;conjugation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"complex%20numbers\"&gt;complex numbers&lt;/a&gt; is an map formula_32, but it is not where formula_33 and formula_34 are symbols representing the sets of real numbers and complex numbers, respectively.\nA linear map formula_35 with formula_9 viewed as a one-dimensional vector space over itself is called a &lt;a href=\"linear%20functional\"&gt;linear functional&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese statements generalize to any left-module formula_37 over a ring formula_38 without modification, and to any right-module upon reversing of the scalar multiplication.\nMatrices.\nIf formula_3 and formula_4 are &lt;a href=\"finite-dimensional\"&gt;finite-dimensional&lt;/a&gt; vector spaces and a &lt;a href=\"basis%20of%20a%20vector%20space\"&gt;basis&lt;/a&gt; is defined for each vector space, then every linear map from formula_3 to formula_4 can be represented by a &lt;a href=\"matrix%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;matrix&lt;/a&gt;. This is useful because it allows concrete calculations. Matrices yield examples of linear maps: if formula_45 is a real formula_46 matrix, then formula_73 describes a linear map formula_74 (see &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20space\"&gt;Euclidean space&lt;/a&gt;).\nLet formula_75 be a basis for formula_3. Then every vector formula_77 is uniquely determined by the coefficients formula_78 in the field formula_48:\nformula_80\nIf formula_52 is a linear map,\nformula_82\nwhich implies that the function \"f\" is entirely determined by the vectors formula_83. Now let formula_84 be a basis for formula_4. Then we can represent each vector formula_86 as\nformula_87\nThus, the function formula_54 is entirely determined by the values of formula_89. If we put these values into an formula_46 matrix formula_91, then we can conveniently use it to compute the vector output of formula_54 for any vector in formula_3. To get formula_91, every column formula_95 of formula_91 is a vector\nformula_97\ncorresponding to formula_86 as defined above. To define it more clearly, for some column formula_95 that corresponds to the mapping formula_86,\nformula_101\nwhere formula_91 is the matrix of formula_54. In other words, every column formula_104 has a corresponding vector formula_86 whose coordinates formula_106 are the elements of column formula_95. A single linear map may be represented by many matrices. This is because the values of the elements of a matrix depend on the bases chosen.\nThe matrices of a linear transformation can be represented visually:\nSuch that starting in the bottom left corner formula_120 and looking for the bottom right corner formula_121, one would left-multiply\u2014that is, formula_122. The equivalent method would be the \"longer\" method going clockwise from the same point such that formula_120 is left-multiplied with formula_124, or formula_125.\nExamples in two dimensions.\nIn two-&lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;al space R2 linear maps are described by 2 \u00d7 2 &lt;a href=\"matrix%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;matrices&lt;/a&gt;. These are some examples:\nVector space of linear maps.\nThe composition of linear maps is linear: if formula_10 and formula_136 are linear, then so is their &lt;a href=\"Relation%20composition\"&gt;composition&lt;/a&gt; formula_137. It follows from this that the &lt;a href=\"class%20%28set%20theory%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; of all vector spaces over a given field \"K\", together with \"K\"-linear maps as &lt;a href=\"morphism\"&gt;morphism&lt;/a&gt;s, forms a &lt;a href=\"category%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;category&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"inverse%20function\"&gt;inverse&lt;/a&gt; of a linear map, when defined, is again a linear map.\nIf formula_138 and formula_139 are linear, then so is their &lt;a href=\"pointwise\"&gt;pointwise&lt;/a&gt; sum formula_140, which is defined by formula_141.\nIf formula_52 is linear and formula_143 is an element of the ground field formula_144, then the map formula_145, defined by formula_146, is also linear.\nThus the set formula_147 of linear maps from formula_148 to formula_149 itself forms a vector space over formula_144, sometimes denoted formula_151. Furthermore, in the case that formula_152, this vector space, denoted formula_153, is an &lt;a href=\"associative%20algebra\"&gt;associative algebra&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"composition%20of%20maps\"&gt;composition of maps&lt;/a&gt;, since the composition of two linear maps is again a linear map, and the composition of maps is always associative. This case is discussed in more detail below.\nGiven again the finite-dimensional case, if bases have been chosen, then the composition of linear maps corresponds to the &lt;a href=\"matrix%20multiplication\"&gt;matrix multiplication&lt;/a&gt;, the addition of linear maps corresponds to the &lt;a href=\"matrix%20addition\"&gt;matrix addition&lt;/a&gt;, and the multiplication of linear maps with scalars corresponds to the multiplication of matrices with scalars.\nEndomorphisms and automorphisms.\nA linear transformation formula_154 is an &lt;a href=\"endomorphism\"&gt;endomorphism&lt;/a&gt; of formula_148; the set of all such endomorphisms formula_156 together with addition, composition and scalar multiplication as defined above forms an &lt;a href=\"associative%20algebra\"&gt;associative algebra&lt;/a&gt; with identity element over the field formula_144 (and in particular a &lt;a href=\"ring%20%28algebra%29\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;). The multiplicative identity element of this algebra is the &lt;a href=\"identity%20function\"&gt;identity map&lt;/a&gt; formula_158.\nAn endomorphism of formula_148 that is also an &lt;a href=\"isomorphism\"&gt;isomorphism&lt;/a&gt; is called an &lt;a href=\"automorphism\"&gt;automorphism&lt;/a&gt; of formula_148. The composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism, and the set of all automorphisms of formula_148 forms a &lt;a href=\"group%20%28math%29\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"automorphism%20group\"&gt;automorphism group&lt;/a&gt; of formula_148 which is denoted by formula_163 or formula_164. Since the automorphisms are precisely those &lt;a href=\"endomorphisms\"&gt;endomorphisms&lt;/a&gt; which possess inverses under composition, formula_163 is the group of &lt;a href=\"Unit%20%28ring%20theory%29\"&gt;units&lt;/a&gt; in the ring formula_156.\nIf formula_148 has finite dimension formula_168, then formula_153 is &lt;a href=\"isomorphism\"&gt;isomorphic&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"associative%20algebra\"&gt;associative algebra&lt;/a&gt; of all formula_170 matrices with entries in formula_144. The automorphism group of formula_148 is &lt;a href=\"group%20isomorphism\"&gt;isomorphic&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"general%20linear%20group\"&gt;general linear group&lt;/a&gt; formula_173 of all formula_170 invertible matrices with entries in formula_144.\nKernel, image and the rank\u2013nullity theorem.\nIf formula_52 is linear, we define the &lt;a href=\"kernel%20%28linear%20operator%29\"&gt;kernel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"image%20%28mathematics%29\"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Range%20of%20a%20function\"&gt;range&lt;/a&gt; of formula_177 by\nformula_178\nformula_179 is a &lt;a href=\"Linear%20subspace\"&gt;subspace&lt;/a&gt; of formula_148 and formula_181 is a subspace of formula_149. The following &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt; formula is known as the &lt;a href=\"rank%E2%80%93nullity%20theorem\"&gt;rank\u2013nullity theorem&lt;/a&gt;:\nformula_183\nThe number formula_184 is also called the &lt;a href=\"rank%20of%20a%20matrix\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; of formula_177 and written as formula_186, or sometimes, formula_187; the number formula_188 is called the &lt;a href=\"Kernel%20%28matrix%29%23Subspace%20properties\"&gt;nullity&lt;/a&gt; of formula_177 and written as formula_190 or formula_191. If formula_148 and formula_149 are finite-dimensional, bases have been chosen and formula_177 is represented by the matrix formula_110, then the rank and nullity of formula_177 are equal to the rank and nullity of the matrix formula_110, respectively.\nCokernel.\nA subtler invariant of a linear transformation formula_52 is the &lt;a href=\"cokernel\"&gt;\"co\"kernel&lt;/a&gt;, which is defined as\nformula_199\nThis is the \"dual\" notion to the kernel: just as the kernel is a \"sub\"space of the \"domain,\" the co-kernel is a &lt;a href=\"quotient%20space%20%28linear%20algebra%29\"&gt;\"quotient\" space&lt;/a&gt; of the \"target.\" Formally, one has the &lt;a href=\"exact%20sequence\"&gt;exact sequence&lt;/a&gt;\nformula_200\nThese can be interpreted thus: given a linear equation \"f\"(v) = w to solve,\nThe dimension of the co-kernel and the dimension of the image (the rank) add up to the dimension of the target space. For finite dimensions, this means that the dimension of the quotient space \"W\"/\"f\"(\"V\") is the dimension of the target space minus the dimension of the image.\nAs a simple example, consider the map \"f\": R2 \u2192 R2, given by \"f\"(\"x\", \"y\") = (0, \"y\"). Then for an equation \"f\"(\"x\", \"y\") = (\"a\", \"b\") to have a solution, we must have \"a\" = 0 (one constraint), and in that case the solution space is (\"x\", \"b\") or equivalently stated, (0, \"b\") + (\"x\", 0), (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace (\"x\", 0) &lt; \"V\": the value of \"x\" is the freedom in a solution \u2013 while the cokernel may be expressed via the map \"W\" \u2192 R, formula_201: given a vector (\"a\", \"b\"), the value of \"a\" is the \"obstruction\" to there being a solution.\nAn example illustrating the infinite-dimensional case is afforded by the map \"f\": R\u221e \u2192 R\u221e, formula_202 with \"b\"1 = 0 and \"b\"\"n\" + 1 = \"an\" for \"n\" &gt; 0. Its image consists of all sequences with first element 0, and thus its cokernel consists of the classes of sequences with identical first element. Thus, whereas its kernel has dimension 0 (it maps only the zero sequence to the zero sequence), its co-kernel has dimension 1. Since the domain and the target space are the same, the rank and the dimension of the kernel add up to the same &lt;a href=\"cardinal%20number%23Cardinal%20addition\"&gt;sum&lt;/a&gt; as the rank and the dimension of the co-kernel (formula_203), but in the infinite-dimensional case it cannot be inferred that the kernel and the co-kernel of an &lt;a href=\"endomorphism\"&gt;endomorphism&lt;/a&gt; have the same dimension (0 \u2260 1). The reverse situation obtains for the map \"h\": R\u221e \u2192 R\u221e, formula_204 with \"cn\" = \"a\"\"n\" + 1. Its image is the entire target space, and hence its co-kernel has dimension 0, but since it maps all sequences in which only the first element is non-zero to the zero sequence, its kernel has dimension 1.\nIndex.\nFor a linear operator with finite-dimensional kernel and co-kernel, one may define \"index\" as:\nformula_205\nnamely the degrees of freedom minus the number of constraints.\nFor a transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces, this is just the difference dim(\"V\") \u2212 dim(\"W\"), by rank\u2013nullity. This gives an indication of how many solutions or how many constraints one has: if mapping from a larger space to a smaller one, the map may be onto, and thus will have degrees of freedom even without constraints. Conversely, if mapping from a smaller space to a larger one, the map cannot be onto, and thus one will have constraints even without degrees of freedom.\nThe index of an operator is precisely the &lt;a href=\"Euler%20characteristic\"&gt;Euler characteristic&lt;/a&gt; of the 2-term complex 0 \u2192 \"V\" \u2192 \"W\" \u2192 0. In &lt;a href=\"operator%20theory\"&gt;operator theory&lt;/a&gt;, the index of &lt;a href=\"Fredholm%20operator\"&gt;Fredholm operator&lt;/a&gt;s is an object of study, with a major result being the &lt;a href=\"Atiyah%E2%80%93Singer%20index%20theorem\"&gt;Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlgebraic classifications of linear transformations.\nNo classification of linear maps could be exhaustive. The following incomplete list enumerates some important classifications that do not require any additional structure on the vector space.\nLet and denote vector spaces over a field and let be a linear map.\nMonomorphism.\n is said to be \"&lt;a href=\"injective\"&gt;injective&lt;/a&gt;\" or a \"&lt;a href=\"monomorphism\"&gt;monomorphism&lt;/a&gt;\" if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\nEpimorphism.\n is said to be \"&lt;a href=\"surjective\"&gt;surjective&lt;/a&gt;\" or an \"&lt;a href=\"epimorphism\"&gt;epimorphism&lt;/a&gt;\" if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:\nIsomorphism.\n is said to be an \"&lt;a href=\"isomorphism\"&gt;isomorphism&lt;/a&gt;\" if it is both left- and right-invertible. This is equivalent to being both one-to-one and onto (a &lt;a href=\"bijection\"&gt;bijection&lt;/a&gt; of sets) or also to being both epic and monic, and so being a &lt;a href=\"bimorphism\"&gt;bimorphism&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf is an endomorphism, then:\nChange of basis.\nGiven a linear map which is an &lt;a href=\"endomorphism\"&gt;endomorphism&lt;/a&gt; whose matrix is \"A\", in the basis \"B\" of the space it transforms vector coordinates [u] as [v] = \"A\"[u]. As vectors change with the inverse of \"B\" (vectors are &lt;a href=\"Covariance%20and%20contravariance%20of%20vectors\"&gt;contravariant&lt;/a&gt;) its inverse transformation is [v] = \"B\"[v'].\nSubstituting this in the first expression\nformula_206\nhence\nformula_207\nTherefore, the matrix in the new basis is \"A\u2032\" = \"B\"\u22121\"AB\", being \"B\" the matrix of the given basis.\nTherefore, linear maps are said to be 1-co- 1-contra-&lt;a href=\"covariance%20and%20contravariance%20of%20vectors\"&gt;variant&lt;/a&gt; objects, or type (1, 1) &lt;a href=\"tensor\"&gt;tensor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nContinuity.\nA \"linear transformation\" between &lt;a href=\"topological%20vector%20space\"&gt;topological vector space&lt;/a&gt;s, for example &lt;a href=\"normed%20space\"&gt;normed space&lt;/a&gt;s, may be &lt;a href=\"continuous%20function%20%28topology%29\"&gt;continuous&lt;/a&gt;. If its domain and codomain are the same, it will then be a &lt;a href=\"continuous%20linear%20operator\"&gt;continuous linear operator&lt;/a&gt;. A linear operator on a normed linear space is continuous if and only if it is &lt;a href=\"bounded%20operator\"&gt;bounded&lt;/a&gt;, for example, when the domain is finite-dimensional. An infinite-dimensional domain may have &lt;a href=\"discontinuous%20linear%20operator\"&gt;discontinuous linear operator&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAn example of an unbounded, hence discontinuous, linear transformation is differentiation on the space of smooth functions equipped with the supremum norm (a function with small values can have a derivative with large values, while the derivative of 0 is 0). For a specific example, converges to 0, but its derivative does not, so differentiation is not continuous at 0 (and by a variation of this argument, it is not continuous anywhere).\nApplications.\nA specific application of linear maps is for &lt;a href=\"geometric%20transformation\"&gt;geometric transformation&lt;/a&gt;s, such as those performed in &lt;a href=\"computer%20graphics\"&gt;computer graphics&lt;/a&gt;, where the translation, rotation and scaling of 2D or 3D objects is performed by the use of a &lt;a href=\"transformation%20matrix\"&gt;transformation matrix&lt;/a&gt;. Linear mappings also are used as a mechanism for describing change: for example in calculus correspond to derivatives; or in relativity, used as a device to keep track of the local transformations of reference frames.\nAnother application of these transformations is in &lt;a href=\"compiler%20optimizations\"&gt;compiler optimizations&lt;/a&gt; of nested-loop code, and in &lt;a href=\"parallelizing%20compiler\"&gt;parallelizing compiler&lt;/a&gt; techniques."
