    "text": "The 1982 Chatham Cup was the 55th annual nationwide knockout &lt;a href=\"association%20football\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; competition in &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand\"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly stages of the competition were run in three regions (northern, central, and southern), with the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20National%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; teams receiving a bye until the Fourth Round of the competition. In all, 125 teams took part in the competition. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article.\nThe 1982 final.\n&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Wellington%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;Mount Wellington&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href=\"New%20Zealand%20National%20Soccer%20League\"&gt;league&lt;/a&gt;/cup double for the second time, the first club to do so. Miramar Rangers' team included England's &lt;a href=\"John%20Fashanu\"&gt;John Fashanu&lt;/a&gt;, who would later win an &lt;a href=\"FA%20Cup\"&gt;FA Cup&lt;/a&gt; winner's medal with &lt;a href=\"Wimbledon%20FC\"&gt;Wimbledon FC&lt;/a&gt;. He is the first \u2014 and the only \u2014 player to play in both a Chatham Cup final and an FA Cup final.\nThe final was deadlocked for the entirety of normal time, and for the first period of extra time. The only goal came two minutes into the second half of extra time with a shot from &lt;a href=\"Keith%20Nelson%20%28footballer%29\"&gt;Keith Nelson&lt;/a&gt; for the Mount. Despite the low score, the final was an exciting one, with Miramar soaking up the Mount's attacks and then countering with dangerous breaks.\nResults.\nFourth Round.\n&lt;a href=\"Western%20AFC\"&gt;Western AFC&lt;/a&gt; received a bye through to the fifth round."
