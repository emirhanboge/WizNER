    "text": "The \"Pohjanmaa\" class is a series of four multi-role &lt;a href=\"corvette\"&gt;corvette&lt;/a&gt;s currently under development for the &lt;a href=\"Finnish%20Navy\"&gt;Finnish Navy&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Squadron 2020 () project. Together with the existing four s, the four new surface combatants will form the backbone of the Finnish Navy from the mid-2020s onwards. They will replace seven older vessels that have been or are due to be decommissioned: the &lt;a href=\"minelayer\"&gt;minelayer&lt;/a&gt; , two s and four s.\nDesign.\nGeneral characteristics.\nThe &lt;a href=\"length%20overall\"&gt;overall length&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Pohjanmaa\"-class corvettes will be about and the &lt;a href=\"Beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; about . The maximum draught of the vessels will be about which corresponds to a &lt;a href=\"Displacement%20%28ship%29\"&gt;displacement&lt;/a&gt; of about . With these main dimensions, the new multi-role corvettes will be the largest Finnish surface combatants since the 1930s &lt;a href=\"coastal%20defence%20ship\"&gt;coastal defence ship&lt;/a&gt;s and . Each ship will have a complement of about 70 officers and crew. Designed for year-round service in the seasonally freezing &lt;a href=\"Baltic%20Sea\"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;, \"Pohjanmaa\"-class corvettes will feature an ice-strengthened hull and ability to operate independently in ice. Although no &lt;a href=\"Finnish-Swedish%20ice%20class\"&gt;Finnish-Swedish ice class&lt;/a&gt; exists for military vessels, the ice capacity of the corvettes will be equivalent to that ice class 1A for merchant ships.\nThe \"Pohjanmaa\" class will feature a &lt;a href=\"combined%20diesel-electric%20and%20gas\"&gt;combined diesel-electric and gas&lt;/a&gt; (CODLAG) propulsion system with a total output of about . During normal patrol operations, the ship's twin ice-strengthened &lt;a href=\"controllable%20pitch%20propeller\"&gt;controllable pitch propeller&lt;/a&gt;s are driven by &lt;a href=\"electric%20motor\"&gt;electric propulsion motors&lt;/a&gt;. However, two of the four &lt;a href=\"V12%20engine\"&gt;12-cylinder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"MAN%20Energy%20Solutions\"&gt;MAN&lt;/a&gt; 12V175D type diesel &lt;a href=\"generating%20set\"&gt;generating set&lt;/a&gt;s are installed on double resilient mountings within soundproof enclosures to reduce noise and vibration during &lt;a href=\"anti-submarine%20warfare\"&gt;anti-submarine warfare&lt;/a&gt; (ASW) missions. When higher speeds are required, a single &lt;a href=\"General%20Electric\"&gt;General Electric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"LM2500\"&gt;LM2500&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gas%20turbine\"&gt;gas turbine&lt;/a&gt; driving both propeller shafts via a common gearbox can be used to achieve speeds in excess of . For low-speed maneuvering, the ships are fitted with two &lt;a href=\"bow%20thruster\"&gt;bow thruster&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCombat management system, Communication system and sensors.\nThe combat management system (CMS) of the \"Pohjanmaa\"-class corvettes will be provided by the Swedish defence company &lt;a href=\"Saab%20AB\"&gt;Saab&lt;/a&gt;. The integrated communication system (ICS) TactiCall is provided by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.saab.com/products/tacticall-integrated-communication-system\"&gt;Saab&lt;/a&gt;. Built around the &lt;a href=\"9LV\"&gt;9LV&lt;/a&gt; CMS, the system will include &lt;a href=\"Giraffe%20radar%23Giraffe%204A\"&gt;Sea Giraffe 4A FF&lt;/a&gt; fixed-face &lt;a href=\"Active%20electronically%20scanned%20array\"&gt;AESA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giraffe%20radar%23Giraffe%201X\"&gt;Sea Giraffe 1X&lt;/a&gt; short-range 3D radars installed on a Saab Lightweight Integrated Mast (SLIM), two &lt;a href=\"CEROS%20200%20Fire%20Control%20Radar\"&gt;CEROS 200&lt;/a&gt; fire control directors, TactiCall integrated communications system, and a laser warning system. Before final selection, the Finnish Navy shortlisted Saab together with &lt;a href=\"Lockheed%20Martin%20Canada\"&gt;Lockheed Martin Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20Elektronik\"&gt;Atlas Elektronik&lt;/a&gt; as the potential combat management system provider and integrator.\nThe underwater sensor suite will consist of &lt;a href=\"Kongsberg\"&gt;Kongsberg&lt;/a&gt;'s SS2030 active hull-mounted &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt; and SD9500 lightweight over-the-side dipping sonar. In addition, \"Pohjanmaa\"-class corvettes will be equipped with Patria's lightweight dual-tow Sonac DTS that includes both an active variable-depth sonar as well as a passive towed receiving array.\nArmament.\n\"Pohjanmaa\"-class corvettes will be armed with a single &lt;a href=\"dual-purpose%20gun\"&gt;dual-purpose&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naval%20gun\"&gt;naval gun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"surface-to-surface%20missile\"&gt;surface-to-surface&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"surface-to-air%20missile\"&gt;surface-to-air missile&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"anti-submarine%20warfare\"&gt;anti-submarine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"naval%20mine\"&gt;naval mine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"close-in%20weapon%20system\"&gt;close-in weapon system&lt;/a&gt;s, and a decoy system.\nThe forward-mounted &lt;a href=\"Bofors%2057%20mm%20L/70%20naval%20artillery%20gun\"&gt;Bofors 57 mm Mk3&lt;/a&gt; dual-purpose main gun will be recycled from the s. In addition, each \"Pohjanmaa\"-class corvette will be fitted with two &lt;a href=\"Saab%20Trackfire\"&gt;Saab Trackfire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"remote%20controlled%20weapon%20station\"&gt;remote controlled weapon station&lt;/a&gt;s for close-in self-defence and four &lt;a href=\"Rheinmetall\"&gt;Rheinmetall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Multi%20Ammunition%20Softkill%20System\"&gt;Multi Ammunition Softkill System&lt;/a&gt; (MASS) decoy launchers.\nThe primary surface-to-surface armament of the \"Pohjanmaa\" class is the &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20%28missile%29\"&gt;Gabriel 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"speed%20of%20sound\"&gt;subsonic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"anti-ship%20missile\"&gt;anti-ship missile&lt;/a&gt;. The latest version of &lt;a href=\"Israel%20Aerospace%20Industries\"&gt;Israel Aerospace Industries&lt;/a&gt;'s anti-ship missile family was selected over Kongsberg's &lt;a href=\"Naval%20Strike%20Missile\"&gt;Naval Strike Missile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MBDA\"&gt;MBDA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Exocet\"&gt;Exocet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boeing\"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Harpoon%20%28missile%29\"&gt;Harpoon&lt;/a&gt; and Saab's &lt;a href=\"RBS15\"&gt;RBS15&lt;/a&gt;. In Finnish Navy service, the missile system will be referred to as PTO2020 (\"Pintatorjuntaohjus 2020\", \"surface defence missile\").\nAgainst aerial targets, \"Pohjanmaa\"-class corvettes will be armed with &lt;a href=\"Raytheon\"&gt;Raytheon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"RIM-162%20ESSM\"&gt;RIM-162 Evolved Seasparrow Missile (ESSM)&lt;/a&gt; surface-to-air missiles. Each vessel will be capable of carrying a total of 32 missiles quad-packed to eight &lt;a href=\"Mark%2041%20Vertical%20Launching%20System\"&gt;Mark 41 Vertical Launching System&lt;/a&gt; silos. In Finnish Navy service, the system will be referred to as ITO20 (\"Ilmatorjuntaohjus 20\").\nFor underwater warfare, the vessels will be fitted with Saab &lt;a href=\"Torped%2047\"&gt;Torped 47&lt;/a&gt; lightweight anti-submarine torpedoes. In addition, \"Pohjanmaa\"-class corvettes will be able to lay &lt;a href=\"naval%20mine\"&gt;naval mine&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDevelopment and construction.\nThe initial development of the new surface combatants for the Finnish Navy began with a research and planning phase in 2008 and the Squadron 2020 project was officially launched in 2015. The 647.6 million &lt;a href=\"euro\"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; shipbuilding contract was awarded to the Finnish shipbuilder &lt;a href=\"Rauma%20Marine%20Constructions\"&gt;Rauma Marine Constructions&lt;/a&gt; in September 2019. In November 2021, the shipyard announced that it would need from 6 to 12 months additional time to complete the design.\nThe construction of the four-strong class will be staggered over 2022\u20132025 and full operational status is achieved in 2028.\nNaming.\nOne of the Finnish Navy's traditions has been to name its major combat ships after regions in Finland. The name \"Pohjanmaa\", which is the Finnish name for the region &lt;a href=\"Ostrobothnia%20%28region%29\"&gt;Ostrobothnia&lt;/a&gt;, has been used both by the Finnish and Swedish navies for previous ships and classes of ships, dating back to the 18th century with the first recorded vessel being \"&lt;a href=\"Pojama%23Ships\"&gt;Gamla Pojama&lt;/a&gt;\" \"(\"Old Pohjanmaa\")\", that was launched in 1760, and the last one, being the minelayer/training vessel , which was sold in 2016. The aforementioned 18th century &lt;a href=\"Pojama\"&gt;Pohjanmaa&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Hemmema\"&gt;H\u00e4meenmaa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Udema\"&gt;Uusimaa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turuma\"&gt;Turunmaa&lt;/a&gt; types were also the four main \"archipelago frigate\" types used in the 1790 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Svensksund\"&gt;Battle of Svensksund&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the largest Finnish (Finland was a part of Sweden at the time) naval victories and the largest naval battle in the Baltic Sea to date.\nCriticism.\nCorvette or frigate?\nWhile the Finnish Navy and the &lt;a href=\"Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28Finland%29\"&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; refer to the new surface combatants as multi-role corvettes, several commentators have pointed out that by displacement the vessels should be classified as &lt;a href=\"frigate\"&gt;frigate&lt;/a&gt;s. In late September 2019, shortly after the construction contract was awarded, MP &lt;a href=\"Johannes%20Yrttiaho\"&gt;Johannes Yrttiaho&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Left%20Alliance%20%28Finland%29\"&gt;Left Alliance&lt;/a&gt;) submitted a written question to the &lt;a href=\"Parliament%20of%20Finland\"&gt;Parliament of Finland&lt;/a&gt; about, among other related topics, the classification of the new ships.\nIn the official blog of the Finnish Defence Forces, &lt;a href=\"Flotilla%20admiral\"&gt;Flotilla admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jori%20Harju\"&gt;Jori Harju&lt;/a&gt; (Commander of the Finnish Navy) noted that one of the reasons leading to the increased displacement is the additional strengthening of the hull, propulsion shaft lines and propellers required for year-round operation in the seasonally freezing Finnish territorial waters. He also pointed out that the \"Pohjanmaa\" class is intended to operate primarily in coastal waters whereas frigates are traditionally considered as the smallest class of warships operating in the high seas as part of a so-called &lt;a href=\"blue-water%20navy\"&gt;blue-water navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nToo large for Finland?\nSince the early 2000s, Finnish Navy's surface combatant fleet has consisted mainly of &lt;a href=\"fast%20attack%20craft\"&gt;fast attack craft&lt;/a&gt; with displacements of . Until the planned commission of the new \"Pohjanmaa\" class, the largest surface combatants of the Finnish Navy remain the two s. Several commentators have criticized the Squadron 2020 program due to the size of the new corvettes: according to critics, the ships are too large for the &lt;a href=\"Archipelago%20Sea\"&gt;often shallow Finnish territorial waters riddled with skerries&lt;/a&gt; as well as too attractive and large targets for &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n anti-ship missiles. Furthermore, it has been speculated that the ship size has been driven by their suitability for international missions rather than domestic defence needs and that the whole concept has been derived from the s operated by the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Finnish Navy has argued that the size of the new ships is a result of combining multiple missions within a single hull. In particular, the ability to lay naval mines has been raised as one of the key features necessitating a larger vessel. Despite some similarities in external appearance to other naval ships, the new multi-role corvettes have been tailored for the Finnish Navy's missions in the Baltic Sea and thus represent a completely new vessel concept with no reference design in service anywhere in the world."
