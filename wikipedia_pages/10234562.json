    "title": "London Double Header",
    "text": "The London Double Header ran between 2004 and 2017 and typically opened the season of &lt;a href=\"Premiership%20Rugby\"&gt;Premiership Rugby&lt;/a&gt; (currently known as the Gallagher Premiership due to sponsorship), the top &lt;a href=\"rugby%20union\"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; league in England.\nTwo games were played consecutively at &lt;a href=\"Twickenham%20Stadium\"&gt;Twickenham Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, originally involving the 'big four' London origin teams of the Premiership, &lt;a href=\"Harlequin%20F.C.\"&gt;Harlequins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London%20Irish\"&gt;London Irish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saracens%20F.C.\"&gt;Saracens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wasps%20RFC\"&gt;Wasps&lt;/a&gt; (London Wasps until the 2014\u201315 season). Harlequins were relegated from the premiership at the end of the &lt;a href=\"2004%E2%80%9305%20Premiership%20Rugby\"&gt;2004\u201305&lt;/a&gt; season and thus for the &lt;a href=\"2005%E2%80%9306%20Premiership%20Rugby\"&gt;2005\u201306&lt;/a&gt; season &lt;a href=\"Leeds%20Tykes\"&gt;Leeds Tykes&lt;/a&gt; were included instead. The same applied to &lt;a href=\"London%20Irish\"&gt;London Irish&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 who were replaced. The matches form part of the regular season fixtures, with one team nominated as the home side for each match. Since 2008 (2016 being an exception) and the inception of &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Game%20%28rugby%29\"&gt;The Big Game&lt;/a&gt;, Harlequins only compete in the double header as an away side in order to reduce the number of home games they play away from &lt;a href=\"Twickenham%20Stoop\"&gt;the Stoop&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom 2015 and following Wasps' relocation to Coventry, the direction of the series changed. Two London teams (normally London Irish and Saracens) acted as the hosts, with the away teams being any of the other 10 Premiership Rugby teams. In 2016, Harlequins hosted due to London Irish's relegation from the premiership. In 2015, 2016 and 2017 the series featured a newly promoted team. The Double Header did not take place in 2018 due to redevelopment works at Twickenham Stadium and has not returned.\nAt other times of year Twickenham is also used for regular season Premiership fixtures, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Game%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;The Big Game&lt;/a&gt; hosted by &lt;a href=\"Harlequin%20F.C.\"&gt;Harlequins&lt;/a&gt; at Christmas time, &lt;a href=\"The%20Clash%20%28rugby%20union%29\"&gt;The Clash&lt;/a&gt; hosted by &lt;a href=\"Bath%20Rugby\"&gt;Bath&lt;/a&gt; and the Premiership Final in June, as well as international fixtures including those by the &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20F.C.\"&gt;Barbarians&lt;/a&gt;, plus inter-armed forces and &lt;a href=\"Varsity%20Rugby\"&gt;varsity&lt;/a&gt; matches.\n2009.\nScorers:\nScorers:\nLondon Wasps 26 \u2013 15 Harlequins\nTeams:\nReplacements: Joe Ward, Ben Broster, Tom French, Dan Leo, Hugo Ellis, Warren Fury, Dave Walder, Lachlan Mitchell.\nScorers:\nReplacements: Tani Fuga, Aston Croall, John Andress, Jim Evans, Tom Guest, Steve So'oialo, Rory Clegg, George Lowe.\nScorers:\nKey:\n2015.\nThe 2015 London Double Header was moved from its traditional Round 1 position, to Round 5, in order to accommodate the &lt;a href=\"2015%20Rugby%20World%20Cup\"&gt;2015 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; knock-out stage matches being played at &lt;a href=\"Twickenham%20Stadium\"&gt;Twickenham Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. It was also the first time since 2005 that &lt;a href=\"Saracens%20F.C.\"&gt;Saracens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harlequin%20F.C.\"&gt;Harlequins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London%20Irish\"&gt;London Irish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wasps%20RFC\"&gt;Wasps&lt;/a&gt; have not all taken part in the event. Harlequins chose not to take part due to the proximity of &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Game%20%28rugby%29%238\"&gt;The Big Game 8&lt;/a&gt; and were therefore replaced by &lt;a href=\"Worcester%20Warriors\"&gt;Worcester Warriors&lt;/a&gt;. There had been suggestions that Wasps would not take part, following their move to the &lt;a href=\"Ricoh%20Arena\"&gt;Ricoh Arena&lt;/a&gt;, however they were announced as one of the away teams for the event at the fixture launch on 3 July 2015.\n2016.\nThe 2016 London Double Header returned to its traditional Round 1 position. &lt;a href=\"London%20Irish\"&gt;London Irish&lt;/a&gt; had been relegated from the Premiership and therefore did not take part. Home teams were confirmed on 28 June, with away teams confirmed at fixture launch on 7 July. \n2017.\nThe 2017 London Double Header took place in its traditional Round 1 position. &lt;a href=\"London%20Irish\"&gt;London Irish&lt;/a&gt; return after being promoted back into the Premiership. Home teams were confirmed on 22 June, with the away teams confirmed at the Premiership fixture launch on 7 July. "
