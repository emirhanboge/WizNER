    "text": "John William 'Jack' Finnie (1927-1994) was an Australian &lt;a href=\"rugby%20league\"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; footballer who played in the 1940s.\nFinnie was the son of the former 'hard punching' southpaw boxer and sometimes stand-over man John Joseph 'Jack' Finnie (1902-1968). Jack Finnie joined the &lt;a href=\"St.%20George%20Dragons\"&gt;St. George Dragons&lt;/a&gt; in 1947. He was a fast winger that played 10 first grade games in 1948. \nHis career was cut short in a violent game against &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Roosters\"&gt;Eastern Suburbs&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Hurstville%20Oval\"&gt;Hurstville Oval&lt;/a&gt; on 24 July 1948 that almost turned into a riot. &lt;a href=\"Sydney%20Roosters\"&gt;East's&lt;/a&gt; forward &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Hobson\"&gt;Sid Hobson&lt;/a&gt;, kicked Finnie in the head and face and Finnie collapsed on the ground unconscious. The Dragons Ball Boy &lt;a href=\"Warren%20Saunders\"&gt;Warren Saunders&lt;/a&gt; was so incensed after seeing the ugly incident, he threw the ball at &lt;a href=\"Sid%20Hobson\"&gt;Sid Hobson&lt;/a&gt;, hitting him between the shoulder blades. Finnie did not play rugby league again after his severe injuries. \nFinnie died on 9 August 1994 at &lt;a href=\"Marrickville%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Marrickville, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;. He is buried with his father and mother at Woronora Catholic Cemetery, &lt;a href=\"Sutherland%2C%20New%20South%20Wales\"&gt;Sutherland, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;."
