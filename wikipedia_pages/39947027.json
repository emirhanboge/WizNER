    "text": "Franconian cuisine is an umbrella term for all dishes with a specific regional identity belonging to the region of &lt;a href=\"Franconia\"&gt;Franconia&lt;/a&gt;. It is a subtype of &lt;a href=\"German%20cuisine\"&gt;German cuisine&lt;/a&gt; with many similarities to &lt;a href=\"Bavarian%20cuisine\"&gt;Bavarian cuisine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swabian%20cuisine\"&gt;Swabian cuisine&lt;/a&gt;. It is often included in the Bavarian cuisine, since most parts of Franconia belong to &lt;a href=\"Bavaria\"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; today. There are several Franconian food items that are also famous beyond the borders of Franconia, such as &lt;a href=\"N%C3%BCrnberger%20Lebkuchen\"&gt;N\u00fcrnberger Lebkuchen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bratwurst\"&gt;Bratwurst&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Franconia%20%28wine%20region%29\"&gt;wines&lt;/a&gt; of Franconia. Franconia is also famous for its &lt;a href=\"beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; and harbours the highest density of breweries in the world.\nBratwurst.\nMost people think of the typical and supraregional known \"N\u00fcrnberger Bratw\u00fcrste\" when they think of Franconian food. These small &lt;a href=\"sausage\"&gt;sausage&lt;/a&gt;s are made of &lt;a href=\"pork\"&gt;pork&lt;/a&gt; and originate in the city zone of &lt;a href=\"N%C3%BCrnberg\"&gt;N\u00fcrnberg&lt;/a&gt; (and only this area is authorized to call the sausages \"N\u00fcrnberger\"). They are commonly served and eaten in threes: either as \"Drei im Weggla\" which means three sausages served in a roll or as a dish containing six of these sausages and &lt;a href=\"cabbage\"&gt;cabbage&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut beyond the famous \"N\u00fcrnberger Bratwurst\" Franconia produces a variety of other &lt;a href=\"bratwurst\"&gt;bratwurst&lt;/a&gt;s, such as the bratwurst produced around &lt;a href=\"Ansbach\"&gt;Ansbach&lt;/a&gt; where the sausage is additionally flavoured with &lt;a href=\"salt\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20pepper\"&gt;pepper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"marjoram\"&gt;marjoram&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther regions feature this &lt;a href=\"spice\"&gt;spice&lt;/a&gt; as well e.g. in the region of Western Mainfranken, a thumb-thick and twelve centimeter long Bratwurst is eaten either alone or in pairs.\nIn the area of &lt;a href=\"Hof%2C%20Bavaria\"&gt;Hof&lt;/a&gt; the small and much leaner \"Hofer Bratwurst\" is very popular and usually eaten in pairs.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Kulmbach\"&gt;Kulmbach&lt;/a&gt; features a similar sausage which, in comparison to the variety from Hof, contain a much higher share of &lt;a href=\"veal\"&gt;veal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother specialty which is only available in the area of &lt;a href=\"Coburg\"&gt;Coburg&lt;/a&gt; is the \"Coburger Bratwurst\" which is similarly thick and coarse as the \"N\u00fcrnberger\" but is roasted on a &lt;a href=\"pinecone\"&gt;pinecone&lt;/a&gt; fire and therefore acquires additional flavours through the smoke.\nAll of these sausage varieties are commonly grilled on a barbecue or in a pan and eaten with rolls and/or &lt;a href=\"sauerkraut\"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes they are also served with &lt;a href=\"Mustard%20%28condiment%29\"&gt;mustard&lt;/a&gt;, either hot or medium or with &lt;a href=\"horseradish\"&gt;horseradish&lt;/a&gt;. Though the addition of &lt;a href=\"ketchup\"&gt;ketchup&lt;/a&gt; is especially famous with children, it is not traditionally used in Franconian cuisine.\nA variation to prepare the sausages, though not so common beyond Franconia, is to stew them in &lt;a href=\"vinegar\"&gt;vinegar&lt;/a&gt; stock which contains &lt;a href=\"vinegar\"&gt;vinegar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"onion\"&gt;onion&lt;/a&gt; rings, sliced &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"salt\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20pepper\"&gt;pepper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bay\"&gt;bay&lt;/a&gt; leaves and &lt;a href=\"juniper%20berry\"&gt;juniper berries&lt;/a&gt;. The sausages are simmered in the broth at a low temperature for about 15 to 20 minutes and then served under the name \"&lt;a href=\"Saure%20Zipfel\"&gt;Saure Zipfel&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"Blaue Zipfel\" (which means \"sour\" or \"blue tips\").\nFor a mid-afternoon snack (which is called \"&lt;a href=\"Brotzeit\"&gt;Brotzeit&lt;/a&gt;\" in Bavaria) it is common to spread raw sausage meat on peasant bread and add diced onions as a topping with salt, pepper and paprika seed. In rural areas this is called \"Tartarbread\" though it has nothing in common with the real &lt;a href=\"Steak%20tartare\"&gt;tartar&lt;/a&gt; which is made of raw &lt;a href=\"beef\"&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther sausage types.\nA typical Franconian Brotzeit dish is Pressack mit Musik (&lt;a href=\"Head%20cheese\"&gt;Head cheese&lt;/a&gt; with music). \"Mit Musik\" means with music and refers to the onions, which are known to be flatulent. Also common are German S\u00fclze, &lt;a href=\"Black%20pudding\"&gt;Blutwurst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beerwurst\"&gt;Bierwurst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stadtwurst\"&gt;Stadtwurst&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Leberk%C3%A4se\"&gt;Leberk\u00e4se&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarp.\nIn the region of &lt;a href=\"Forchheim\"&gt;Forchheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Windsheim\"&gt;Bad Windsheim&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"carp\"&gt;mirror carp&lt;/a&gt; is a native. It is traditionally cut lengthwise and baked of served \"blue\" which means that it is stewed in &lt;a href=\"vinegar\"&gt;vinegar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; stock. The baked &lt;a href=\"roe\"&gt;roe&lt;/a&gt; of the fish is considered a delicacy and known under the name \"Ingreisch\" which means \"innards\". As this is a very famous dish one should preorder it in most restaurants. To eat these specialities the best restaurants are those with own pools where the carp is kept and the best time is early autumn in the months September to November. After November the carp is most frequently imported from Eastern Europe and is therefore not as fresh as in the months before.\nMeat.\nAs in most of Germany's regional cuisines, many meat dishes are found in Franconia, especially from pork. Very well known are baked pork shoulders, the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Sch%C3%A4ufele\"&gt;Sch\u00e4ufele&lt;/a&gt;\" (because of the shovel-like shoulder blade) with its cross and cut &lt;a href=\"pork%20rinds\"&gt;rind&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the very popular one is the pork roast with crust and potato dumplings, which is also popular in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Bavaria\"&gt;Upper Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, where it is served with &lt;a href=\"sauerkraut\"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt; while the Franconians serve it with &lt;a href=\"red%20cabbage\"&gt;red cabbage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"savoy%20cabbage\"&gt;savoy cabbage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"green%20bean\"&gt;green bean&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA speciality is also the \"fr\u00e4nkische &lt;a href=\"Sauerbraten\"&gt;Sauerbraten&lt;/a&gt;\". In contrast to the \"rheinische Sauerbraten\" it is prepared without the use of &lt;a href=\"raisin\"&gt;raisin&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"sauce\"&gt;sauce&lt;/a&gt; is thickened with soaked and lightly sweeted &lt;a href=\"ginger%20bread\"&gt;ginger bread&lt;/a&gt;. This ingredient gives the dish its own typical flavour, which is then rounded off with &lt;a href=\"red%20cabbage\"&gt;red cabbage&lt;/a&gt; and in some regions the addition of &lt;a href=\"lingonberry\"&gt;lingonberry&lt;/a&gt; compote.\nThe recipe of the famous \"Schweinfurter &lt;a href=\"Schlachtsch%C3%BCssel\"&gt;Schlachtsch\u00fcssel&lt;/a&gt;\" Is cooked pork meat served together with &lt;a href=\"sauerkraut\"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt;, fresh &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; and ground &lt;a href=\"horseradish\"&gt;horseradish&lt;/a&gt; on table-size wood plates. Common drinks include Franconian wine, and at the end each guest gets a portion of liver and &lt;a href=\"blood%20sausage\"&gt;blood sausage&lt;/a&gt;s to take home.\nBaked blood, also called \"Schwaa\u00df\" is still a popular traditional dish, particularly in the area of &lt;a href=\"Hof%2C%20Bavaria\"&gt;Hof&lt;/a&gt;. The blood of the slaughtered animal is collected and then baked with diced &lt;a href=\"bacon\"&gt;bacon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"onion\"&gt;onion&lt;/a&gt;, stale &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"marjoram\"&gt;marjoram&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"salt\"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt;. It is eaten with sauerkraut and &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es as &lt;a href=\"side%20dish\"&gt;side dish&lt;/a&gt;es.\nSide dishes.\nIn Franconia it is a tradition to eat mixed &lt;a href=\"salad\"&gt;salad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raspeball\"&gt;Kl\u00f6\u00dfe&lt;/a&gt; as a side dish to any &lt;a href=\"roast\"&gt;roast&lt;/a&gt;. The special \"Rohe Kl\u00f6\u00dfe\" (lit. meaning \"raw Kl\u00f6\u00dfe\") are prepared only with grated raw &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt; and filled with some dices of stale bread. If there are any Kl\u00f6\u00dfe left from the &lt;a href=\"Sunday%20roast\"&gt;Sunday roast&lt;/a&gt; they are traditionally sliced and cooked in a pan. Another traditional side dish are \"Wickelkl\u00f6\u00dfe\". These are made out of potato dough which is rolled out, spread with melted &lt;a href=\"butter\"&gt;butter&lt;/a&gt;, sprinkled with breadcrumbs and then wrapped together and sliced into Klo\u00df-sized pieces. They are considered a speciality from the region of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Franconia\"&gt;Lower Franconia&lt;/a&gt; but eaten also in other regions. A third type of Kl\u00f6\u00dfe are Semmelkl\u00f6\u00dfe, which are made from mashed dry &lt;a href=\"Bread%20roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt;s soaked in milk and cooked. Instead of dumplings sometimes broad noodles (\"Bandnudeln\") are served with roasts.\nVegetables are hardly ever a main but almost always a side dish. Very common are &lt;a href=\"sauerkraut\"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt;, white &lt;a href=\"cabbage\"&gt;cabbage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20cabbage\"&gt;red cabbage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"savoy%20cabbage\"&gt;savoy cabbage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kohlrabi\"&gt;Kohlrabi&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Scorzonera%20hispanica\"&gt;Salsify&lt;/a&gt; is also often featured in dishes, and has been grown in &lt;a href=\"Franconia\"&gt;Franconia&lt;/a&gt; since the 17th century. In winter they are served in a &lt;a href=\"cream\"&gt;cream&lt;/a&gt; sauce with &lt;a href=\"ham\"&gt;ham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es. In summer a variation of this dish is served but with &lt;a href=\"asparagus\"&gt;asparagus&lt;/a&gt; originating in the region north of &lt;a href=\"N%C3%BCrnberg\"&gt;N\u00fcrnberg&lt;/a&gt; instead of the salsify. But the asparagus is also used in salads or is eaten with the famous Bratwurst.\nA special side dish or condiment is &lt;a href=\"horseradish\"&gt;horseradish&lt;/a&gt; which is called \"Kren\" in Bavaria. It is grown mainly in the areas around &lt;a href=\"Erlangen\"&gt;Erlangen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forchheim\"&gt;Forchheim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"H%C3%B6chstadt%20an%20der%20Aisch\"&gt;H\u00f6chstadt an der Aisch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baiersdorf\"&gt;Baiersdorf&lt;/a&gt; and is commonly used as a condiment in the sauce which is served with &lt;a href=\"Tafelspitz\"&gt;Tafelspitz&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoups.\nTypical Franconian soups are &lt;a href=\"bread%20soup\"&gt;bread soup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"semolina\"&gt;semolina&lt;/a&gt; dumpling soup (German: \"Grieskl\u00f6schensuppe\"), &lt;a href=\"pancake\"&gt;pancake&lt;/a&gt; soup (\"Fl\u00e4dlasuppe\"), and &lt;a href=\"liver\"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; dumpling soup (&lt;a href=\"Leberkn%C3%B6del\"&gt;Leberkn\u00f6del&lt;/a&gt;suppe). Another Franconian dish is a kind of steamed &lt;a href=\"chanterelle\"&gt;chanterelle&lt;/a&gt; (\"Saure Pfiffer\").\nSalads.\nSalads, which are usually served with a main dish include Franconian &lt;a href=\"potato%20salad\"&gt;potato salad&lt;/a&gt;, which is made with &lt;a href=\"Broth\"&gt;Broth&lt;/a&gt;, mixed salad or &lt;a href=\"Coleslaw\"&gt;Coleslaw&lt;/a&gt; (German: \"Krautsalat\"). A Brotzeit dish is the &lt;a href=\"Wurstsalat\"&gt;Wurstsalat&lt;/a&gt; (for example \"N\u00fcrnberger Gwerch\").\nDrinks.\nFranconia is the home of about 270, often small, &lt;a href=\"brewery\"&gt;breweries&lt;/a&gt;. In summer the cellars open their doors and many restaurants offer a small mid-afternoon snack with a litre of beer (commonly called a \"Ma\u00df\") or a half litre (commonly called a Seidel). &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Franconia\"&gt;Upper Franconia&lt;/a&gt; has the highest concentration of breweries in the world. A large proportion of them are located in &lt;a href=\"Franconian%20Switzerland\"&gt;Franconian Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. A local speciality from Bamberg is the famous &lt;a href=\"Smoked%20beer\"&gt;Smoked beer&lt;/a&gt; (German:\"Rauchbier\"). The main beer types of Franconia are &lt;a href=\"dunkel\"&gt;dunkel&lt;/a&gt; (German: \"Dunkles Bier\") and &lt;a href=\"pale%20lager\"&gt;pale lager&lt;/a&gt; (\"Helles Bier\"). Other types like &lt;a href=\"wheat%20beer\"&gt;wheat beer&lt;/a&gt; (German: \"Hefeweizen\"), &lt;a href=\"m%C3%A4rzen\"&gt;m\u00e4rzen&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"bock\"&gt;bock&lt;/a&gt; are also common.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Kulmbach\"&gt;Kulmbach&lt;/a&gt; is also known as the \"secret capital of beer\" since one of the breweries there advertised their product with this slogan and in the city of &lt;a href=\"Hof%2C%20Bavaria\"&gt;Hof&lt;/a&gt; there are still 6 independent breweries in existence, while in &lt;a href=\"N%C3%BCrnberg\"&gt;N\u00fcrnberg&lt;/a&gt; there are only 4. The city of &lt;a href=\"Bamberg\"&gt;Bamberg&lt;/a&gt; tops the list with 12 breweries and only 70,000 inhabitants, and is therefore considered \"Franconia's beer city\", sometimes even Germany's beer city.\nWine is common in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Franconia\"&gt;Lower Franconia&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a href=\"River%20Main\"&gt;River Main&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Franconia%20%28wine%20region%29\"&gt;Franconia&lt;/a&gt; is one of the German quality wine regions, and the wine of Franconia is typically bottled in bulbous Bocksbeutel-bottles, and the region is a wine-growing area especially famous for its white wine &lt;a href=\"Silvaner\"&gt;Silvaner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bacchus\"&gt;Bacchus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Riesling\"&gt;Riesling&lt;/a&gt;, and the dry red wine &lt;a href=\"Domina%20%28grape%29\"&gt;Domina&lt;/a&gt;. During grape harvesting the &lt;a href=\"Federweisser\"&gt;Federweisser&lt;/a&gt; is another well-known regional variety.\nFranconian &lt;a href=\"Federwei%C3%9Fer\"&gt;Federwei\u00dfer&lt;/a&gt; is an alcoholic beverage, made of grape juice that is still in the process of fermenting. Typically it has about 4 percent alcohol by volume. (The term in principle includes all stages of fermentation from &lt;a href=\"must\"&gt;must&lt;/a&gt; to finished wine.)\nTypical spirits of Franconia are &lt;a href=\"Obstbrand\"&gt;Obstbr\u00e4nde&lt;/a&gt; (also called \"Geist\") or &lt;a href=\"liqueur\"&gt;liqueur&lt;/a&gt;s, which are made of apples, plums (\"Zwetschgen\") pears, or cherries.\nBread.\nSimilar to other German regions, Franconian bread types range from white wheat bread (Wei\u00dfbrot) to grey (Graubrot) to black (Schwarzbrot), actually dark brown &lt;a href=\"rye\"&gt;rye&lt;/a&gt; bread. The typical Franconian bread (\"Fr\u00e4nkisches Landbrot\") contains both wheat and rye flour (hence &lt;a href=\"Mischbrot\"&gt;Mischbrot&lt;/a&gt;, mixed bread). Characteristic for this bread is a high percentage of rye flavour, usually 80% and about 20% wheat flour and an aromatic spice mixture. The shape can be longish (\"Kipf\") or round (\"Laib\"). The weight is usually around 1 - 4,5\u00a0kg.\n&lt;a href=\"Pretzel\"&gt;Pretzel&lt;/a&gt;s and bread rolls are also common.\nZwiebelkuchen.\nFranconian &lt;a href=\"Zwiebelkuchen\"&gt;Zwiebelkuchen&lt;/a&gt;, which literally means onion cake, is a pie made of steamed onions, diced bacon, cream, and &lt;a href=\"caraway\"&gt;caraway&lt;/a&gt; seeds on a yeast dough.\nLebkuchen.\n&lt;a href=\"Ginger%20bread\"&gt;Ginger bread&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"N%C3%BCrnberger%20Lebkuchen\"&gt;N\u00fcrnberger Lebkuchen&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most famous delicacies of Franconian cuisine. In the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Ages\"&gt;Middle Ages&lt;/a&gt; Nuremberg (German: \"N\u00fcrnberg\") was a trading centre also for exotic spices and other specialities. In the forest surround the city there were many &lt;a href=\"beekeepers\"&gt;beekeepers&lt;/a&gt; which supplied the markets with &lt;a href=\"honey\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; and especially because of these facts the long tradition on gingerbread-making originates in this city. From the end of August until winter time the little biscuits are offered with \"Christkindlesmarkt-Gl\u00fchwein\" (&lt;a href=\"mulled%20wine\"&gt;mulled wine&lt;/a&gt; made with &lt;a href=\"blueberry\"&gt;blueberries&lt;/a&gt;). Nowadays there are only a few small manufacturers left with artisanal production and the majority of the Lebkuchen are made in industrial production.\nDuring Christmas and advent season there are also several bakeries and confectioner shops producing their own Lebkuchen and other Christmas biscuits. The most common and most famous variety is the \"Elisenlebkuchen\" which often has a rectangular shape (most varieties are traditionally round-shaped). Very important are also the quality levels which are determined in the \"Leits\u00e4tze f\u00fcr feine Backwaren\" (Principles for pastries and baked goods) and the sophisticated quality level for Lebkuchen requires it to be made with &lt;a href=\"wafer\"&gt;wafer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nK\u00fcchla (Little cakes).\n\"K\u00fcchla\" or \"K\u00fcchle\" (lit. meaning \"little cakes\") are a supraregional popular specialty of Franconia, and are sweet, pan-fried yeast-dough pastry which is commonly prepared fresh on festive occasions.\nThere are several variations in existence: they may be rectangular, square, or round; the latter are most common and are also known as \"Kniek\u00fcchla\" which means \"knee cakes\". This name derives from the original method of preparation which required the baker to draw the yeast dough over his knee to obtain the typically thin crust of the K\u00fcchla. Nowadays it is either drawn over the back of the hand, a turned doughnut stick, or even a &lt;a href=\"rubber\"&gt;rubber&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ball\"&gt;ball&lt;/a&gt;. With this method, the round pastry is very thin in the middle and almost translucent, and its rim is quite bulbous and has a flavour quite similar to a &lt;a href=\"doughnut\"&gt;doughnut&lt;/a&gt;. In the obtained shape, the K\u00fcchla are fried and typically served with powdered &lt;a href=\"confectioner%27s%20sugar\"&gt;confectioner's sugar&lt;/a&gt;.\nRectangular K\u00fcchle, which are also called \"Striezel,\" puff up during &lt;a href=\"frying\"&gt;frying&lt;/a&gt; like a &lt;a href=\"cushion\"&gt;cushion&lt;/a&gt;, a process which is called \"rising\". After frying, they have a thin and flat golden brown base, and a thicker, cushion-like upper part. As the K\u00fcchle are turned once during the cooking process, it is essential that the dough is without any defects; if there are only minimal ones and the dough tears during rinsing, the pastry will collapse and remain flat. These misshaped products are also called \"Dutschen\".\nSchneeballen.\n&lt;a href=\"Schneeballen\"&gt;Schneeballen&lt;/a&gt; (\"snowballs\") are a type of shortcrust pastry especially popular in the area of Rothenburg ob der Tauber. Its name derives from its round, ball-like shape with a diameter of about eight to ten centimeters, and is traditionally decorated with confectioner's sugar."
