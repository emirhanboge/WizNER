    "text": "The 1891\u201392 &lt;a href=\"British%20Home%20Championship\"&gt;British Home Championship&lt;/a&gt; was an edition of the annual international &lt;a href=\"football%20%28soccer%29\"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; tournament played between the British &lt;a href=\"Home%20Nations\"&gt;Home Nations&lt;/a&gt;. It was won by &lt;a href=\"England%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; who won all three games against their rivals, even though they played two games on the same day against &lt;a href=\"Wales%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29\"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, providing a team of amateur players for the Welsh match and professionals against Ireland, both teams forging solid 2\u20130 victories. &lt;a href=\"Scotland%20national%20football%20team\"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; came second, winning their matches against Wales and Ireland, who shared third place after drawing with one another.\nEngland's double victories came shortly after the Welsh-Irish draw in &lt;a href=\"Bangor%2C%20Gwynedd\"&gt;Bangor&lt;/a&gt; and it gave them an immediate advantage over their opponents. The Scottish team then played their games, narrowly beating Ireland in &lt;a href=\"Belfast\"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; and defeating Wales by a crushing 6\u20131 scoreline to equal England's points tally and become favourites. In the final match at &lt;a href=\"Glasgow\"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, England and Scotland played out a decider which England won easily, scoring four early goals to which Scotland could only reply with a single goal of their own.\nTable.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"
