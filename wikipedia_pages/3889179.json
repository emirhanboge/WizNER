The last beach is a narrow strip under the cliff of a part of &lt;a href=\"Perunika%20Glacier\"&gt;Perunika Glacier&lt;/a&gt; terminating on the coast. Bulgarian Beach is surmounted by a chain of five hills comprising &lt;a href=\"Hesperides%20Hill\"&gt;Hesperides Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pesyakov%20Hill\"&gt;Pesyakov Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sinemorets%20Hill\"&gt;Sinemorets Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spanish%20Knoll\"&gt;Spanish Knoll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belozem%20Hill\"&gt;Belozem Hill&lt;/a&gt;. In summer the area is predominantly snow-free and crossed by four meltwater streams draining the north-western slope of the &lt;a href=\"Balkan%20Snowfield\"&gt;Balkan Snowfield&lt;/a&gt;, with stream mouths located at the western extremities of each beach. The first beach, locally known as Base Beach, is partly occupied by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Lagoon\"&gt;Grand Lagoon&lt;/a&gt; formed by &lt;a href=\"Rezovski%20Creek\"&gt;Rezovski Creek&lt;/a&gt;. Access by dinghies to Base Beach, used for transfer of people and cargo to the Bulgarian base &lt;a href=\"St.%20Kliment%20Ohridski%20Base\"&gt;St.\u00a0Kliment Ohridski&lt;/a&gt;, is sometimes rendered difficult by shallow waters.\nThe area would have been known and possibly visited in the early nineteenth century by &lt;a href=\"England\"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; and American &lt;a href=\"Seal%20hunter\"&gt;sealer&lt;/a&gt;s frequenting &lt;a href=\"South%20Bay%2C%20Livingston%20Island\"&gt;South Bay&lt;/a&gt; and particularly the nearby &lt;a href=\"Johnsons%20Dock\"&gt;Johnsons Dock&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nThe beach is centred at . Bulgarian Beach was mapped in detail by the &lt;a href=\"Spain\"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; Servicio Geogr\u00e1fico del Ej\u00e9rcito in 1991 following earlier &lt;a href=\"United%20Kingdom\"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argentina\"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chile\"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;an mappings. &lt;a href=\"Bulgaria\"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n mapping of Bulgarian Beach and the &lt;a href=\"Emona%20Anchorage\"&gt;Emona Anchorage&lt;/a&gt; coast from a topographic survey carried out from 8 December 1995 to 8 February 1996, and mapping of the &lt;a href=\"St.%20Kliment%20Ohridski%20Base\"&gt;St.\u00a0Kliment Ohridski Base&lt;/a&gt; vicinity at a larger scale from a topographic survey made from January 31 to February 4, 1996."
