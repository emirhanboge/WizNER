    "text": "An offshore trust is a conventional &lt;a href=\"Trust%20law\"&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; that is formed under the &lt;a href=\"law\"&gt;law&lt;/a&gt;s of an &lt;a href=\"Offshore%20Financial%20Centre\"&gt;offshore jurisdiction&lt;/a&gt;.\nGenerally offshore trusts are similar in nature and effect to their onshore counterparts; they involve a &lt;a href=\"settlor\"&gt;settlor&lt;/a&gt; transferring (or 'settling') assets (the 'trust property') on the &lt;a href=\"trustee\"&gt;trustee&lt;/a&gt;s to manage for the benefit of a person, class or persons (the '&lt;a href=\"beneficiary%20%28trust%29\"&gt;beneficiaries&lt;/a&gt;') or, occasionally, an abstract purpose. However, a number of offshore jurisdictions have modified their laws to make their jurisdictions more attractive to settlors forming offshore structures as trusts. &lt;a href=\"Liechtenstein\"&gt;Liechtenstein&lt;/a&gt;, a civil jurisdiction which is sometimes considered to be offshore, has artificially imported the trust concept from &lt;a href=\"common%20law\"&gt;common law&lt;/a&gt; jurisdictions by &lt;a href=\"statute\"&gt;statute&lt;/a&gt;.\nUses of offshore trusts.\nOfficial statistics on trusts are difficult to come by as in most offshore jurisdictions (and in most onshore jurisdictions), trusts are not required to be registered, however, it is thought that the most common use of offshore trusts is as part of the tax and financial planning of wealthy individuals and their families. For instance, the founder of &lt;a href=\"Wonga.com\"&gt;Wonga.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Errol%20Damelin\"&gt;Errol Damelin&lt;/a&gt; holds his shares through Castle Bridge Ventures, a trust based in the British Virgin Islands. While the family behind the &lt;a href=\"Nando%27s\"&gt;Nando's&lt;/a&gt; restaurant chain, the Enthovens, reportedly use trusts in the Channel Islands as part of their financial planning. Other users of offshore trusts include &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Ken%20Morrison\"&gt;Sir Ken Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, the British supermarket magnate, the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rothermere\"&gt;Rothermere&lt;/a&gt; family who own the &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Mail\"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; group and the late &lt;a href=\"Bruce%20Gyngell\"&gt;Bruce Gyngell&lt;/a&gt; who founded &lt;a href=\"TV-am\"&gt;TV-am&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, offshore trusts have other uses too:\nTypes of offshore trusts.\nBelow are the most common types of trusts:\nA Revocable Offshore Trust is a trust which can be liquidated or altered by the settlor according to the terms, that are set out in the Trust Deed.\nIn an Irrevocable Offshore Trust may not be changed or liquidated by the settlor.\nA &lt;a href=\"Discretionary%20trust\"&gt;Discretionary Offshore Trust&lt;/a&gt; enables the trustee to decide on the distribution of profits for different classes of beneficiaries.\nIn a Fixed trust, the distribution of income to the beneficiaries is fixed and can not be changed by trustee.\nA Hybrid Trust includes elements of discretionary and fixed trust.\nRule against perpetuities.\nTrusts in general are subject to the &lt;a href=\"rule%20against%20perpetuities\"&gt;rule against perpetuities&lt;/a&gt; which, in practical terms, puts limits on the length of time within which all trust property must be distributed. Because of the strictures of the rule, a number of trusts have been struck down in wildly hypothetical circumstances because of possible infringement of the rule (e.g., the \"&lt;a href=\"fertile%20octogenarian\"&gt;fertile octogenarian&lt;/a&gt;\").\nMost offshore jurisdictions which have sophisticated trust laws have modified their laws relating to perpetuity to allow settlor to select lengthy, fixed, perpetuity periods, to avoid the use of &lt;a href=\"Royal%20lives%20clause\"&gt;\"Royal lives\" clauses&lt;/a&gt;. Many have also adopted \"wait and see\" laws, which mean that trusts which might potentially infringe the rule against perpetuities are no longer automatically invalid, but instead the trust remains valid unless and until the perpetuity period is breached.\nIn Jersey, the rule against perpetual trusts has actually been abolished entirely. This has also been done in a number of U.S. states.\nManagement of underlying companies.\nTrusts in general are subject to the rule in \"&lt;a href=\"Bartlett%20v%20Barclays%20Bank\"&gt;Bartlett v Barclays Bank&lt;/a&gt;\" which provides (briefly) that where trust property includes the &lt;a href=\"Stock\"&gt;shares&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"Company%20%28law%29\"&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;, then the trustees must take a positive role in the affairs on the company. The rule has been &lt;a href=\"Bartlett%20v%20Barclays%20Bank\"&gt;criticised&lt;/a&gt;, but remains part of trust law in many common law jurisdictions.\nA number of offshore jurisdictions (notably the &lt;a href=\"Cayman%20Islands\"&gt;Cayman Islands&lt;/a&gt;, with STAR trusts, and the &lt;a href=\"British%20Virgin%20Islands\"&gt;British Virgin Islands&lt;/a&gt;, with VISTA trusts) have created special forms of trust that may be expressly settled without imposing an obligation of the trustees to interfere in management in this way.\nParadoxically, these specialised forms of trusts seem to infrequently be used in relation to their original intended uses. STAR trusts seem to be used more frequently by &lt;a href=\"hedge%20fund\"&gt;hedge fund&lt;/a&gt;s forming &lt;a href=\"mutual%20fund\"&gt;mutual fund&lt;/a&gt;s as &lt;a href=\"unit%20trust\"&gt;unit trust&lt;/a&gt;s (where the fund managers wish to eliminate any obligation to attend meetings of the companies in whose securities they invest) and VISTA trusts are frequently used as a part of &lt;a href=\"orphan%20structure\"&gt;orphan structure&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Bond%20%28finance%29\"&gt;bond&lt;/a&gt; issues where the trustees wish to divorce themselves from supervising the issuing vehicle.\nCritics in onshore jurisdictions have suggested that these specialised trusts have provisions that so fundamentally undermine the nature of a trust that they should not be recognised in an onshore jurisdiction, but whatever the view of onshore tax authorities and regulators, it seems unlikely that the courts in onshore jurisdictions would be prepared to derogate from the &lt;a href=\"Hague%20Convention%20on%20the%20Law%20Applicable%20to%20Trusts%20and%20on%20their%20Recognition\"&gt;Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition&lt;/a&gt;.\nAsset protection.\nCertain jurisdictions (notably the &lt;a href=\"Cook%20Islands\"&gt;Cook Islands&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Bahamas\"&gt;Bahamas&lt;/a&gt; also has a species of asset protection trust) have provided special trusts which are styled as &lt;a href=\"Asset-protection%20trusts\"&gt;asset protection trusts&lt;/a&gt;. While all trusts have an &lt;a href=\"asset%20protection\"&gt;asset protection&lt;/a&gt; element, some jurisdictions have enacted laws trying to make life difficult for creditors to press claims against the trust (for example, by providing for particularly short limitation periods). In practice, the effectiveness of such trusts is limited as the &lt;a href=\"bankruptcy\"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"divorce\"&gt;divorce&lt;/a&gt; laws in the settlor's home jurisdiction will usually operate to set aside transfers to the trusts, and most jurisdictions (including offshore jurisdictions) set aside &lt;a href=\"fraudulent%20conveyance\"&gt;transactions entered into defraud creditors&lt;/a&gt;.\nPowers of investment.\nMost traditional jurisdictions only permit trustees to make very conservative financial &lt;a href=\"investments\"&gt;investments&lt;/a&gt;. Most offshore jurisdictions give trustees flexibility and permit (or allow the settlor to specify in the &lt;a href=\"trust%20instrument\"&gt;trust instrument&lt;/a&gt; that they are permitted) a wider range of investments, including higher risk investments such as &lt;a href=\"derivative%20%28finance%29\"&gt;derivatives&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"futures%20contract\"&gt;futures contract&lt;/a&gt;s and specific investments, such as an investment into a small private company, in any area of the world.\nPurpose trusts.\nWhilst in most common law jurisdictions, trusts must either be formed for the benefit of persons, or charitable purposes, many offshore jurisdictions have also amended their laws to permit trusts to be formed for &lt;a href=\"purpose%20trust\"&gt;non-charitable purposes&lt;/a&gt;. Such trusts need to enforce a \"protector\" to be able to enforce the terms of the trust, but doubt remains as to who should be treated as the beneficial owner of the trust funds for tax purposes prior to its distribution.\nNo offshore jurisdiction yet appears to have made a serious effort to expand upon the flexibility of &lt;a href=\"discretionary%20trust\"&gt;discretionary trust&lt;/a&gt;s in relation to certainty of objects, as expounded in \"&lt;a href=\"McPhail%20v%20Doulton\"&gt;McPhail v Doulton&lt;/a&gt;\". This may be because the common law rules are now considered to be sufficiently flexible to make no widening necessary to attract trust business.\nAnachronistic common law rules.\nMany offshore jurisdictions have also legislated to abolish certain anachronistic common law rules which sometimes cause difficulty for trust planning.
