    "text": "Sailing employs the wind\u2014acting on &lt;a href=\"sail\"&gt;sail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wingsail\"&gt;wingsail&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014to propel a craft on the surface of the \"water\" (&lt;a href=\"sailing%20ship\"&gt;sailing ship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Windsurfing\"&gt;windsurfer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Kitesurfing\"&gt;kitesurfer&lt;/a&gt;), on \"ice\" (&lt;a href=\"iceboat\"&gt;iceboat&lt;/a&gt;) or on \"land\" (&lt;a href=\"Land%20sailing\"&gt;land yacht&lt;/a&gt;) over a chosen &lt;a href=\"Course%20%28navigation%29\"&gt;course&lt;/a&gt;, which is often part of a larger plan of &lt;a href=\"navigation\"&gt;navigation&lt;/a&gt;.\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, sailing ships were the primary means for marine exploration, commerce, and projection of military power; this period is known as the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Sail\"&gt;Age of Sail&lt;/a&gt;. In the 21st century, most sailing represents a form of &lt;a href=\"recreation\"&gt;recreation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sailing%20%28sport%29\"&gt;sport&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Boating\"&gt;Recreational sailing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"yachting\"&gt;yachting&lt;/a&gt; can be divided into &lt;a href=\"yacht%20racing\"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cruising%20%28maritime%29\"&gt;cruising&lt;/a&gt;. Cruising can include extended offshore and ocean-crossing trips, coastal sailing within sight of land, and daysailing.\nSailing relies on the &lt;a href=\"Forces%20on%20sails\"&gt;physics of sails&lt;/a&gt; as they derive power from the wind, generating both lift and drag. On a given course, the sails are set to an angle that optimizes the development of wind power, as determined by the &lt;a href=\"apparent%20wind\"&gt;apparent wind&lt;/a&gt;, which is the wind as sensed from a moving vessel. The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;hull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt; of a sailing craft, by forces from skate runners of an iceboat, or by forces from wheels of a land sailing craft to allow steering the course. This combination of forces means that it is possible to sail an upwind course as well as downwind. The course with respect to the true wind direction (as would be indicated by a stationary flag) is called a &lt;a href=\"point%20of%20sail\"&gt;point of sail&lt;/a&gt;. Conventional sailing craft cannot derive wind power on a course with a point of sail that is too close into the wind.\nHistory.\nThroughout history sailing has been a key form of propulsion that allowed greater mobility than travel over land, whether for exploration, trade, transport, or warfare, and that increased the capacity for fishing, compared to that from shore.\nEarly square rigs generally could not sail much closer than 80\u00b0 to the wind, whereas early fore-and-aft rigs could sail as close as 60\u201375\u00b0 off the wind. Later square-rigged vessels too were able to sail to windward, and became the standard for European ships through the Age of Discovery when vessels ventured around Africa to India, to the Americas and around the world. Sailing ships became longer and faster over time, with ship-rigged vessels carrying taller masts with more square sails. The &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Sail\"&gt;Age of Sail&lt;/a&gt; (1570\u20131870) reached its peak in the 18th and 19th centuries with merchant sailing ships that were able to travel at speeds that exceeded those of the newly introduced &lt;a href=\"steamship\"&gt;steamship&lt;/a&gt;s.\nExploration and research.\n&lt;a href=\"Austronesian%20peoples\"&gt;Austronesian peoples&lt;/a&gt; sailed from what is now Southern China and &lt;a href=\"Taiwan\"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; with of &lt;a href=\"Catamaran\"&gt;Catamaran&lt;/a&gt;s or vessels &lt;a href=\"Outrigger%20ship\"&gt;outriggers&lt;/a&gt;, and crab claw sails, which enabled the &lt;a href=\"Austronesian%20Expansion\"&gt;Austronesian Expansion&lt;/a&gt; at around 3000 to 1500 BCE into the islands of &lt;a href=\"Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia\"&gt;Maritime Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;, and thence to &lt;a href=\"Micronesia\"&gt;Micronesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Island%20Melanesia\"&gt;Island Melanesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polynesia\"&gt;Polynesia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Madagascar\"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;. They traveled vast distances of open ocean in &lt;a href=\"outrigger%20canoe\"&gt;outrigger canoe&lt;/a&gt;s using navigation methods such as &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Islands%20stick%20chart\"&gt;stick charts&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Discovery\"&gt;Age of Discovery&lt;/a&gt;\u2014starting in the 15th century\u2014square-rigged, multi-masted vessels were the norm and were guided by navigation techniques that included the magnetic compass and making sightings of the sun and stars that allowed transoceanic voyages.\nDuring the Age of Discovery, sailing ships figured in European voyages around Africa to China and Japan; and across the Atlantic Ocean to North and South America. Later, sailing ships ventured into the Arctic to explore northern sea routes and assess natural resources. In the 18th and 19th centuries sailing vessels made &lt;a href=\"Hydrographic%20survey\"&gt;Hydrographic survey&lt;/a&gt;s to develop charts for navigation and, at times, carried scientists aboard as with the voyages of &lt;a href=\"James%20Cook\"&gt;James Cook&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle\"&gt;Second voyage of HMS \"Beagle\"&lt;/a&gt; with naturalist &lt;a href=\"Charles%20Darwin\"&gt;Charles Darwin&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommerce.\nIn the early 1800s, fast blockade-running schooners and brigantines\u2014&lt;a href=\"Baltimore%20Clipper\"&gt;Baltimore Clipper&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014evolved into three-masted, typically ship-rigged sailing vessels with fine lines that enhanced speed, but lessened capacity for high-value cargo, like tea from China. Masts were as high as and were able to achieve speeds of , allowing for passages of up to per 24 hours. Clippers yielded to bulkier, slower vessels, which became economically competitive in the mid 19th century. Sail plans with just fore-and-aft sails (&lt;a href=\"schooner\"&gt;schooner&lt;/a&gt;s), or a mixture of the two (&lt;a href=\"brigantine\"&gt;brigantine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"barque\"&gt;barque&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"barquentine\"&gt;barquentine&lt;/a&gt;s) emerged. Coastal top-sail schooners with a crew as small as two managing the sail handling became an efficient way to carry bulk cargo, since only the fore-sails required tending while &lt;a href=\"Tacking%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;tacking&lt;/a&gt; and steam-driven machinery was often available for raising the sails and the anchor.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron-hulled%20sailing%20ship\"&gt;Iron-hulled sailing ship&lt;/a&gt;s represented the final evolution of sailing ships at the end of the Age of Sail. They were built to carry bulk cargo for long distances in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They were the largest of merchant sailing ships, with three to five masts and square sails, as well as other &lt;a href=\"sail%20plan\"&gt;sail plan&lt;/a&gt;s. They carried bulk cargoes between continents. Iron-hulled sailing ships were mainly built from the 1870s to 1900, when &lt;a href=\"steamship\"&gt;steamship&lt;/a&gt;s began to outpace them economically, due to their ability to keep a schedule regardless of the wind. Steel hulls also replaced iron hulls at around the same time. Even into the twentieth century, sailing ships could hold their own on transoceanic voyages such as Australia to Europe, since they did not require &lt;a href=\"Coal%20bunker\"&gt;bunkerage&lt;/a&gt; for coal nor fresh water for steam, and they were faster than the early steamers, which usually could barely make . Ultimately, the steamships' independence from the wind and their ability to take shorter routes, passing through the &lt;a href=\"Suez%20Canal\"&gt;Suez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Panama%20Canal\"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt;s, made sailing ships uneconomical.\nNaval power.\nUntil the general adoption of &lt;a href=\"Carvel%20%28boat%20building%29\"&gt;carvel&lt;/a&gt;-built ships that relied on an internal skeleton structure to bear the weight of the ship and for gun ports to be cut in the side, sailing ships were just vehicles for delivering fighters to the enemy for engagement. By 1500, &lt;a href=\"Gun%20port\"&gt;Gun port&lt;/a&gt;s allowed sailing vessels to sail alongside an enemy vessel and fire a &lt;a href=\"Broadside%20%28naval%29\"&gt;broadside&lt;/a&gt; of multiple cannon. This development allowed for naval fleets to array themselves into a &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20battle\"&gt;line of battle&lt;/a&gt;, whereby, &lt;a href=\"Ship%20of%20the%20line\"&gt;warships&lt;/a&gt; would maintain their place in the line to engage the enemy in a parallel or perpendicular line.\nModern applications.\nWhile the use of sailing vessels for commerce or naval power has been supplanted with engine-driven vessels, there continue to be commercial operations that take passengers on sailing cruises. Modern navies also employ &lt;a href=\"Training%20ship\"&gt;sailing vessels&lt;/a&gt; to train cadets in &lt;a href=\"seamanship\"&gt;seamanship&lt;/a&gt;. Recreation or sport accounts for the bulk of sailing in modern boats.\nRecreation.\nRecreational sailing can be divided into two categories, day-sailing, where one gets off the boat for the night, and cruising, where one stays aboard.\n&lt;a href=\"Day%20sailer\"&gt;Day-sailing&lt;/a&gt; primarily affords experiencing the pleasure of sailing a boat. No destination is required. It is an opportunity to share the experience with others. A variety of boats with no overnight accommodations, ranging in size from to over , may be regarded as day sailors.\n&lt;a href=\"Sailing%20yacht%23Cruising\"&gt;Cruising on a sailing yacht&lt;/a&gt; may be either near-shore or passage-making out of sight of land and entails the use of sailboats that support sustained overnight use. Coastal cruising grounds include areas of the Mediterranean and Black Seas, Northern Europe, Western Europe and islands of the North Atlantic, West Africa and the islands of the South Atlantic, the Caribbean, and regions of North and Central America. Passage-making under sail occurs on routes through oceans all over the world. Circular routes exist between the Americas and Europe, and between South Africa and South America. There are many routes from the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia to island destinations in the South Pacific. Some cruisers &lt;a href=\"Circumnavigation\"&gt;circumnavigate&lt;/a&gt; the globe.\nSport.\nSailing as a sport is organized on a hierarchical basis, starting at the &lt;a href=\"yacht%20club\"&gt;yacht club&lt;/a&gt; level and reaching up into national and international federations; it may entail &lt;a href=\"Sailing%20yacht%23Racing\"&gt;racing yachts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dinghy%20sailing\"&gt;sailing dinghies&lt;/a&gt;, or other small, open sailing craft, including iceboats and land yachts. &lt;a href=\"Yacht%20racing\"&gt;Sailboat racing&lt;/a&gt; is governed by &lt;a href=\"World%20Sailing\"&gt;World Sailing&lt;/a&gt; with most racing formats using the &lt;a href=\"Racing%20Rules%20of%20Sailing\"&gt;Racing Rules of Sailing&lt;/a&gt;. It entails a variety of different disciplines, including:\nNavigation.\nPoint of sail.\nA sailing craft's ability to derive power from the wind depends on the &lt;a href=\"point%20of%20sail\"&gt;point of sail&lt;/a&gt; it is on\u2014the direction of travel under sail in relation to the true wind direction over the surface. The principal points of sail roughly correspond to 45\u00b0 segments of a circle, starting with 0\u00b0 directly into the wind. For many sailing craft, the arc spanning 45\u00b0 on either side of the wind is a \"no-go\" zone, where a sail is unable to mobilize power from the wind. Sailing on a course as close to the wind as possible\u2014approximately 45\u00b0\u2014is termed \"close-hauled\". At 90\u00b0 off the wind, a craft is on a \"beam reach\". At 135\u00b0 off the wind, a craft is on a \"broad reach\". At 180\u00b0 off the wind (sailing in the same direction as the wind), a craft is \"running downwind\".\nIn points of sail that range from close-hauled to a broad reach, sails act substantially like a wing, with lift predominantly propelling the craft. In points of sail from a broad reach to down wind, sails act substantially like a parachute, with drag predominantly propelling the craft. For craft with little forward resistance, such as &lt;a href=\"ice%20boat\"&gt;ice boat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"land%20yacht\"&gt;land yacht&lt;/a&gt;s, this transition occurs further off the wind than for &lt;a href=\"sailboat\"&gt;sailboat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sailing%20ship\"&gt;sailing ship&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWind direction for points of sail always refers to the \"true wind\"\u2014the wind felt by a stationary observer. The \"&lt;a href=\"apparent%20wind\"&gt;apparent wind&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014the wind felt by an observer on a moving sailing craft\u2014determines the &lt;a href=\"Forces%20on%20sails\"&gt;motive power&lt;/a&gt; for sailing craft.\nThe waves give an indication of the \"true wind\" direction. The flag gives an indication of \"apparent wind\" direction.\nEffect on apparent wind.\nTrue wind velocity (VT) &lt;a href=\"Euclidean%20vector%23Addition%20and%20subtraction\"&gt;combines&lt;/a&gt; with the sailing craft's velocity (VB) to be the \"apparent wind velocity\" (VA), the air velocity experienced by instrumentation or crew on a moving sailing craft. Apparent wind velocity provides the motive power for the sails on any given point of sail. It varies from being the true wind velocity of a stopped craft in irons in the no-go zone to being faster than the true wind speed as the sailing craft's velocity adds to the true windspeed on a reach, to diminishing towards zero, as a sailing craft sails dead downwind.\nSailing craft A is close-hauled. Sailing craft B is on a beam reach. Sailing craft C is on a broad reach.Boat velocity (in black) generates an equal and opposite apparent wind component (not shown), which adds to the true wind to become apparent wind.\nThe speed of sailboats through the water is limited by the resistance that results from hull drag in the water. Ice boats typically have the least resistance to forward motion of any sailing craft. Consequently, a sailboat experiences a wider range of apparent wind angles than does an ice boat, whose speed is typically great enough to have the apparent wind coming from a few degrees to one side of its course, necessitating sailing with the sail sheeted in for most points of sail. On conventional sailboats, the sails are set to create lift for those points of sail where it's possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind.\nFor a sailboat, point of sail affects lateral force significantly. The higher the boat points to the wind under sail, the stronger the lateral force, which requires resistance from a keel or other underwater foils, including daggerboard, centerboard, skeg and rudder. Lateral force also induces heeling in a sailboat, which requires resistance by weight of ballast from the crew or the boat itself and by the shape of the boat, especially with a catamaran. As the boat points off the wind, lateral force and the forces required to resist it become less important.\nOn ice boats, lateral forces are countered by the lateral resistance of the blades on ice and their distance apart, which generally prevents heeling.\nCourse under sail.\nWind and currents are important factors to plan on for both offshore and inshore sailing. Predicting the availability, strength and direction of the wind is key to using its power along the desired course. Ocean currents, tides and river currents may deflect a sailing vessel from its desired course.\nIf the desired course is within the no-go zone, then the sailing craft must follow a zig-zag route into the wind to reach its waypoint or destination. Downwind, certain high-performance sailing craft can reach the destination more quickly by following a zig-zag route on a series of broad reaches.\nNegotiating obstructions or a channel may also require a change of direction with respect to the wind, necessitating changing of tack with the wind on the opposite side of the craft, from before.\nChanging tack is called \"tacking\" when the wind crosses over the bow of the craft as it turns and \"jibing\" (or \"gybing\") if the wind passes over the stern.\nUpwind.\nA sailing craft can sail on a course anywhere outside of its no-go zone. If the next waypoint or destination is within the arc defined by the no-go zone from the craft's current position, then it must perform a series of &lt;a href=\"Tacking%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;tacking maneuvers&lt;/a&gt; to get there on a dog-legged route, called \"beating to windward\". The progress along that route is called the \"course made good\"; the speed between the starting and ending points of the route is called the \"speed made good\" and is calculated by the distance between the two points, divided by the travel time. The limiting line to the waypoint that allows the sailing vessel to leave it to leeward is called the \"layline\". Whereas some &lt;a href=\"Bermuda%20rig\"&gt;Bermuda-rigged&lt;/a&gt; sailing yachts can sail as close as 30\u00b0 to the wind, most 20th-Century square riggers are limited to 60\u00b0 off the wind. &lt;a href=\"Fore-and-aft%20rig\"&gt;Fore-and-aft rig&lt;/a&gt;s are designed to operate with the wind on either side, whereas &lt;a href=\"square%20rig\"&gt;square rig&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;s are designed to have the wind come from one side of the sail only.\nBecause the lateral wind forces are highest on a sailing vessel, close-hauled and beating to windward, the resisting water forces around the vessel's keel, centerboard, rudder and other foils is also highest to mitigate &lt;a href=\"leeway\"&gt;leeway&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the vessel sliding to leeward of its course. Ice boats and land yachts minimize lateral motion with sidewise resistance from their blades or wheels.\nChanging tack by tacking.\n\"Tacking\" or \"coming about\" is a maneuver by which a sailing craft turns its &lt;a href=\"bow%20%28ship%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; into and through the wind (called the \"eye of the wind\") so that the apparent wind changes from one side to the other, allowing progress on the opposite tack. The type of sailing rig dictates the procedures and constraints on achieving a tacking maneuver. Fore-and-aft rigs allow their sails to hang limp as they tack; square rigs must present the full frontal area of the sail to the wind, when changing from side to side; and &lt;a href=\"windsurfer\"&gt;windsurfer&lt;/a&gt;s have flexibly pivoting and fully rotating masts that get flipped from side to side.\nDownwind.\nA sailing craft can travel directly downwind only at a speed that is less than the wind speed. However, a &lt;a href=\"High-performance%20sailing\"&gt;variety of sailing craft&lt;/a&gt; can achieve a higher downwind &lt;a href=\"velocity%20made%20good\"&gt;velocity made good&lt;/a&gt; by traveling on a series of broad reaches, punctuated by jibes in between. This is true of ice boats and sand yachts. On the water it was explored by sailing vessels, starting in 1975, and now extends to high-performance skiffs, catamarans and foiling sailboats.\nNavigating a channel or a downwind course among obstructions may necessitate changes in direction that require a change of tack, accomplished with a jibe.\nChanging tack by jibing.\n\"Jibing\" or \"gybing\" is a sailing maneuver by which a sailing craft turns its &lt;a href=\"stern\"&gt;stern&lt;/a&gt; past the eye of the wind so that the apparent wind changes from one side to the other, allowing progress on the opposite tack. This maneuver can be done on smaller boats by pulling the tiller towards yourself (the opposite side of the sail). As with tacking, the type of sailing rig dictates the procedures and constraints for jibing. Fore-and-aft sails with booms, gaffs or sprits are unstable when the free end points into the eye of the wind and must be controlled to avoid a violent change to the other side; square rigs as they present the full area of the sail to the wind from the rear experience little change of operation from one tack to the other; and &lt;a href=\"windsurfer\"&gt;windsurfer&lt;/a&gt;s again have flexibly pivoting and fully rotating masts that get flipped from side to side.\nWind and currents.\nWinds and oceanic currents are both the result of the sun powering their respective fluid media. Wind powers the sailing craft and the ocean bears the craft on its course, as currents may alter the course of a sailing vessel on the ocean or a river.\nTrimming.\nTrimming refers to adjusting the lines that control sails, including the sheets that control angle of the sails with respect to the wind, the halyards that raise and tighten the sail, and to adjusting the hull's resistance to heeling, yawing or progress through the water.\nSails.\nSquare sails are controlled by two each of: sheets, braces, &lt;a href=\"Clewlines%20and%20buntlines\"&gt;clewlines&lt;/a&gt;, and reef tackles, plus four &lt;a href=\"Clewlines%20and%20buntlines\"&gt;buntlines&lt;/a&gt;, each of which may be controlled by a crew member as the sail is adjusted. Towards the end of the Age of Sail, steam-powered machinery reduced the number of crew required to trim sail.\nAdjustment of the angle of a fore-and-aft sail with respect to the apparent wind is controlled with a line, called a \"sheet\". On points of sail between close-hauled and a broad reach, the goal is typically to create flow along the sail to maximize power through lift. Streamers placed on the surface of the sail, called &lt;a href=\"Tell-tale%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;tell-tales&lt;/a&gt;, indicate whether that flow is smooth or turbulent. Smooth flow on both sides indicates proper trim. A jib and mainsail are typically configured to be adjusted to create a smooth &lt;a href=\"laminar%20flow\"&gt;laminar flow&lt;/a&gt;, leading from one to the other in what is called the \"slot effect\".\nOn downwind points of sail, power is achieved primarily with the wind pushing on the sail, as indicated by drooping tell-tales. &lt;a href=\"Spinnaker\"&gt;Spinnaker&lt;/a&gt;s are light-weight, large-area, highly curved sails that are adapted to sailing off the wind.\nIn addition to using the sheets to adjust the angle with respect to the apparent wind, other lines control the shape of the sail, notably the &lt;a href=\"outhaul\"&gt;outhaul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"halyard\"&gt;halyard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boom%20vang\"&gt;boom vang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"backstay\"&gt;backstay&lt;/a&gt;. These control the curvature that is appropriate to the windspeed, the higher the wind, the flatter the sail. When the wind strength is greater than these adjustments can accommodate to prevent overpowering the sailing craft, then reducing sail area through &lt;a href=\"reefing\"&gt;reefing&lt;/a&gt;, substituting a smaller sail or by other means.\nReducing sail.\nReducing sail on square-rigged ships could be accomplished by exposing less of each sail, by tying it off higher up with reefing points. Additionally, as winds get stronger, sails can be furled or removed from the spars, entirely until the vessel is surviving hurricane-force winds under \"bare poles\".\nOn fore-and-aft rigged vessels, reducing sail may &lt;a href=\"furl%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;furling&lt;/a&gt; the jib and by reefing or partially lowering the mainsail, that is reducing the area of a sail without actually changing it for a smaller sail. This results both in a reduced sail area but also in a lower centre of effort from the sails, reducing the heeling moment and keeping the boat more upright.\nThere are three common methods of reefing the mainsail:\nHull.\nHull trim has three aspects, each tied to an axis of rotation, they are controlling:\nEach is a reaction to forces on sails and is achieved either by weight distribution or by management of the center of force of the underwater foils (keel, daggerboard, etc.), compared with the center of force on the sails.\nHeeling.\nA sailing vessel's form stability (the resistance of hull shape to rolling) is the starting point for resisting heeling. Catamarans and iceboats have a wide stance that makes them resistant to heeling. Additional measures for trimming a sailing craft to control heeling include:\nHelm force.\nThe alignment of center of force of the sails with center of resistance of the hull and its appendices controls whether the craft will track straight with little steering input, or whether correction needs to be made to hold it away from turning into the wind (a weather helm) or turning away from the wind (a lee helm). A center of force behind the center of resistance causes a weather helm. The center of force ahead of the center of resistance causes a lee helm. When the two are closely aligned, the helm is neutral and requires little input to maintain course.\nHull drag.\nFore-and-aft weight distribution changes the cross-section of a vessel in the water. Small sailing craft are sensitive to crew placement. They are usually designed to have the crew stationed midships to minimize hull drag in the water.\nOther aspects of seamanship.\n&lt;a href=\"Seamanship\"&gt;Seamanship&lt;/a&gt; encompasses all aspects of taking a sailing vessel in and out of port, navigating it to its destination, and securing it at anchor or alongside a dock. Important aspects of seamanship include employing a common language aboard a sailing craft and the management of lines that control the sails and rigging.\nNautical terms.\nNautical terms for elements of a vessel: &lt;a href=\"starboard\"&gt;starboard&lt;/a&gt; (right-hand side), port or larboard (left-hand side), forward or fore (frontward), aft or abaft (rearward), bow (forward part of the hull), stern (aft part of the hull), beam (the widest part). Spars, supporting sails, include masts, booms, yards, gaffs and poles. Moveable lines that control sails or other equipment are known collectively as a vessel's &lt;a href=\"running%20rigging\"&gt;running rigging&lt;/a&gt;. Lines that raise sails are called \"&lt;a href=\"halyard\"&gt;halyard&lt;/a&gt;s\" while those that strike them are called \"downhauls\". Lines that adjust (trim) the sails are called \"&lt;a href=\"sheet%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;sheets&lt;/a&gt;\". These are often referred to using the name of the sail they control (such as \"main sheet\" or \"jib sheet\"). \"&lt;a href=\"Guy%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;Guys&lt;/a&gt;\" are used to control the ends of other &lt;a href=\"Spar%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;spars&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"spinnaker%20pole\"&gt;spinnaker pole&lt;/a&gt;s. Lines used to tie a boat up when alongside are called \"docklines\", \"docking cables\" or \"mooring warps\". A \"rode\" is what attaches an anchored boat to its &lt;a href=\"anchor\"&gt;anchor&lt;/a&gt;.\nManagement of lines.\nThe following knots are regarded as integral to handling ropes and lines, while sailing:\nLines and halyards are typically coiled neatly for stowage and reuse.\nSail physics.\nThe physics of sailing arises from a balance of forces between the wind powering the sailing craft as it passes over its sails and the resistance by the sailing craft against being blown off course, which is provided in the water by the &lt;a href=\"keel\"&gt;keel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rudder\"&gt;rudder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Foil%20%28fluid%20mechanics%29\"&gt;underwater foils&lt;/a&gt; and other elements of the underbody of a sailboat, on ice by the runners of an &lt;a href=\"iceboat\"&gt;iceboat&lt;/a&gt;, or on land by the wheels of a &lt;a href=\"Land%20sailing\"&gt;sail-powered land vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.\nForces on sails depend on wind speed and direction and the speed and direction of the craft. The speed of the craft at a given point of sail contributes to the \"&lt;a href=\"apparent%20wind\"&gt;apparent wind&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014the wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft. The apparent wind on the sail creates a total aerodynamic force, which may be resolved into &lt;a href=\"Drag%20%28physics%29\"&gt;drag&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the force component in the direction of the apparent wind\u2014and &lt;a href=\"Lift%20%28force%29\"&gt;lift&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the force component &lt;a href=\"normal%20%28geometry%29\"&gt;normal&lt;/a&gt; (90\u00b0) to the apparent wind. Depending on the alignment of the sail with the apparent wind (\"&lt;a href=\"angle%20of%20attack\"&gt;angle of attack&lt;/a&gt;\"), lift or drag may be the predominant propulsive component. Depending on the angle of attack of a set of sails with respect to the apparent wind, each sail is providing motive force to the sailing craft either from lift-dominant attached flow or drag-dominant separated flow. Additionally, sails may interact with one another to create forces that are different from the sum of the individual contributions of each sail, when used alone.\nApparent wind velocity.\nThe term \"&lt;a href=\"velocity\"&gt;velocity&lt;/a&gt;\" refers both to speed and direction. As applied to wind, \"apparent wind velocity\" (VA) is the air velocity acting upon the leading edge of the most forward sail or as experienced by instrumentation or crew on a moving sailing craft. In &lt;a href=\"nautical%20terminology\"&gt;nautical terminology&lt;/a&gt;, wind speeds are normally expressed in &lt;a href=\"Knot%20%28unit%29\"&gt;knots&lt;/a&gt; and wind angles in &lt;a href=\"degree%20%28angle%29\"&gt;degree&lt;/a&gt;s. All sailing craft reach a constant \"forward velocity\" (VB) for a given \"true wind velocity\" (VT) and \"point of sail\". The craft's point of sail affects its velocity for a given true wind velocity. Conventional sailing craft cannot derive power from the wind in a \"no-go\" zone that is approximately 40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 away from the true wind, depending on the craft. Likewise, the directly downwind speed of all conventional sailing craft is limited to the true wind speed. As a sailboat sails further from the wind, the apparent wind becomes smaller and the lateral component becomes less; boat speed is highest on the beam reach. To act like an airfoil, the sail on a sailboat is sheeted further out as the course is further off the wind. As an iceboat sails further from the wind, the apparent wind increases slightly and the boat speed is highest on the broad reach. In order to act like an airfoil, the sail on an iceboat is sheeted in for all three points of sail.\nLift and drag on sails.\n\"Lift\" on a sail, acting as an &lt;a href=\"airfoil\"&gt;airfoil&lt;/a&gt;, occurs in a direction \"perpendicular\" to the incident airstream (the apparent wind velocity for the headsail) and is a result of pressure differences between the windward and leeward surfaces and depends on the angle of attack, sail shape, air density, and speed of the apparent wind. The lift force results from the average pressure on the windward surface of the sail being higher than the average pressure on the leeward side. These pressure differences arise in conjunction with the curved airflow. As air follows a curved path along the windward side of a sail, there is a pressure &lt;a href=\"gradient\"&gt;gradient&lt;/a&gt; perpendicular to the flow direction with higher pressure on the outside of the curve and lower pressure on the inside. To generate lift, a sail must present an \"&lt;a href=\"angle%20of%20attack\"&gt;angle of attack&lt;/a&gt;\" between the &lt;a href=\"Chord%20%28aeronautics%29\"&gt;chord line&lt;/a&gt; of the sail and the apparent wind velocity. The angle of attack is a function of both the craft's point of sail and how the sail is adjusted with respect to the apparent wind.\nAs the lift generated by a sail increases, so does &lt;a href=\"lift-induced%20drag\"&gt;lift-induced drag&lt;/a&gt;, which together with &lt;a href=\"parasitic%20drag\"&gt;parasitic drag&lt;/a&gt; constitute total \"drag\", which acts in a direction \"parallel\" to the incident airstream. This occurs as the angle of attack increases with sail trim or change of course and causes the &lt;a href=\"lift%20coefficient\"&gt;lift coefficient&lt;/a&gt; to increase up to the point of &lt;a href=\"aerodynamic%20stall\"&gt;aerodynamic stall&lt;/a&gt; along with the lift-induced &lt;a href=\"drag%20coefficient\"&gt;drag coefficient&lt;/a&gt;. At the onset of stall, lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag. Sails with the apparent wind behind them (especially going downwind) operate in a stalled condition.\nLift and drag are components of the total aerodynamic force on sail, which are resisted by forces in the water (for a boat) or on the traveled surface (for an iceboat or land sailing craft). Sails act in two basic modes; under the \"lift-predominant\" mode, the sail behaves in a manner analogous to a \"wing\" with airflow attached to both surfaces; under the \"drag-predominant\" mode, the sail acts in a manner analogous to a \"parachute\" with airflow in detached flow, eddying around the sail.\nLift predominance (wing mode).\nSails allow progress of a sailing craft to windward, thanks to their ability to generate lift (and the craft's ability to resist the lateral forces that result). Each sail configuration has a characteristic coefficient of lift and attendant coefficient of drag, which can be determined experimentally and calculated theoretically. Sailing craft orient their sails with a favorable angle of attack between the entry point of the sail and the apparent wind even as their course changes. The ability to generate lift is limited by sailing too close to the wind when no effective angle of attack is available to generate lift (causing luffing) and sailing sufficiently off the wind that the sail cannot be oriented at a favorable angle of attack to prevent the sail from &lt;a href=\"Stall%20%28fluid%20dynamics%29\"&gt;stalling&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"flow%20separation\"&gt;flow separation&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrag predominance (parachute mode).\nWhen sailing craft are on a course where the angle between the sail and the apparent wind (the angle of attack) exceeds the point of maximum lift, separation of flow occurs. Drag increases and lift decreases with increasing angle of attack as the separation becomes progressively pronounced until the sail is perpendicular to the apparent wind, when lift becomes negligible and drag predominates. In addition to the sails used upwind, &lt;a href=\"spinnaker\"&gt;spinnaker&lt;/a&gt;s provide area and curvature appropriate for sailing with separated flow on downwind points of sail, analogous to parachutes, which provide both lift and drag.\nWind variation with height and time.\nWind speed increases with height above the surface; at the same time, wind speed may vary over short periods of time as gusts.\n&lt;a href=\"Wind%20shear\"&gt;Wind shear&lt;/a&gt; affects sailing craft in motion by presenting a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the &lt;a href=\"mast%20%28sailing%29\"&gt;mast&lt;/a&gt;. Wind shear occurs because of friction above a water surface slowing the flow of air. The ratio of wind at the surface to wind at a height above the surface varies by a power law with an exponent of 0.11-0.13 over the ocean. This means that a wind at 3 m above the water would be approximately at above the water. In hurricane-force winds with at the surface the speed at would be This suggests that sails that reach higher above the surface can be subject to stronger wind forces that move the centre of effort on them higher above the surface and increase the heeling moment. Additionally, apparent wind direction moves aft with height above water, which may necessitate a corresponding &lt;a href=\"Sail%20twist\"&gt;twist in the shape of the sail&lt;/a&gt; to achieve attached flow with height.\nGusts may be predicted by the same value that serves as an exponent for wind shear, serving as a gust factor. So, one can expect gusts to be about 1.5 times stronger than the prevailing wind speed (a 10-knot wind might gust up to 15 knots). This, combined with changes in wind direction suggest the degree to which a sailing craft must adjust sail angle to wind gusts on a given course.\nHull physics.\nWaterborne sailing craft rely on the design of the hull and keel to provide minimal forward drag in opposition to the sails' propulsive power and maximum resistance to the sails' lateral forces. In modern sailboats, drag is minimized by control of the hull's shape (blunt or fine), appendages, and slipperiness. The keel or other underwater foils provide the lateral resistance to forces on the sails. Heeling increases both drag and the ability of the boat to track along its desired course. Wave generation for a displacement hull is another important limitation on boat speed.\nDrag.\nDrag due to its form is described by a &lt;a href=\"Hull%20%28watercraft%29\"&gt;prismatic coefficient&lt;/a&gt;, Cp = displaced volume of the vessel divided by waterline length times maximum displaced section area\u2014the maximum value of Cp = 1.0 being for a constant displace cross section area, as would be found on a barge. For modern sailboats, values of 0.53 \u2264 Cp \u2264 0.6 are likely because of the tapered shape of the submerged hull towards both ends. Reducing interior volume allows creating a finer hull with less drag. Because a keel or other underwater foil produces lift, it also produces drag, which increases as the boat heels. Wetted area of the hull affects total the amount of friction between the water and the hull's surface, creating another component of drag.\nLateral resistance.\nSailboats use some sort of underwater foil to generate lift that maintains the forward direction of the boat under sail. Whereas sails operate at angles of attack between 10\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 incident to the wind, underwater foils operate at angles of attack between 0\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 incident to the water passing by. Neither their angle of attack nor surface is adjustable (except for moveable foils) and they are never intentionally stalled. Heeling the vessel away from perpendicular into the water significantly degrades the boat's ability to point into the wind.\nWave generation.\nFor displacement hulls have are limited in speed at a level defined by the square root of the boat's water line, the boat's &lt;a href=\"hull%20speed\"&gt;hull speed&lt;/a&gt;. The addition of more power from sails or other source does not allow the vessel to go faster, it merely generates a wake with higher waves. Planing and foiling sailboats transcend this limitation, whereby speed becomes a linear function of power. Sailing craft on ice runners or wheels encounter forward resistance that depends on friction with their respective bearing surfaces."
