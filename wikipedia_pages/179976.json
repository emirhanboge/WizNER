    "text": "The University of North Texas (UNT) is a &lt;a href=\"Public%20university\"&gt;public&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"research%20university\"&gt;research university&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Denton%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Denton, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Until 1988, it was known as North Texas State University. It consists of 14 colleges and schools, an early admissions math and science academy for exceptional high-school-age students from across the state, the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Academy%20of%20Mathematics%20and%20Science\"&gt;Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science&lt;/a&gt;, and a library system that comprises the university core. The university is &lt;a href=\"Carnegie%20Classification%20of%20Institutions%20of%20Higher%20Education\"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". According to the &lt;a href=\"National%20Science%20Foundation\"&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, UNT spent $78.4 million on research and development in 2019.\nUNT was founded as a &lt;a href=\"nonsectarian\"&gt;nonsectarian&lt;/a&gt;, coeducational, private &lt;a href=\"Normal%20school\"&gt;teachers college&lt;/a&gt; in 1890 and was formally adopted by the state 11 years later. UNT is the flagship institution of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Texas%20System\"&gt;University of North Texas System&lt;/a&gt;, which includes additional universities in &lt;a href=\"Dallas\"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Fort Worth&lt;/a&gt;. UNT also has a location in &lt;a href=\"Frisco%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Frisco&lt;/a&gt;.\nCampus.\nThe main campus is located in Denton, TX part of the largest metropolitan area in Texas, Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW). The campus is 1,200 acres including the main campus north of I-35E, the Eagle point athletic complex south of I-35E, and Discovery Park; a research campus located between state highways 77 and 380.\nOn behalf of the state, the university, in its civic advocacy for the state, prevailed with three new-location, capital-intensive expansions over the last years.\nIn 1981, the university spun off its new &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Texas%20Health%20Science%20Center\"&gt;medical school&lt;/a&gt; as its own independent institution under the &lt;a href=\"UNT%20System\"&gt;UNT Board of Regents&lt;/a&gt;. In 2009, the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Texas%20at%20Dallas\"&gt;University of North Texas at Dallas&lt;/a&gt; became its own independent institution. That same year, the Texas legislature approved the creation of &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Texas%20at%20Dallas%20College%20of%20Law\"&gt;University of North Texas at Dallas College of Law&lt;/a&gt;, opening in 2014 in &lt;a href=\"Downtown%20Dallas\"&gt;Downtown Dallas&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Texas%20at%20Dallas\"&gt;UNT Dallas&lt;/a&gt;. UNT and its three sister institutions are governed by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Texas%20System\"&gt;University of North Texas System&lt;/a&gt;, a system established in 1980 by the board of regents and legislatively recognized in 2003 by the &lt;a href=\"Seventy-eighth%20Texas%20Legislature\"&gt;78th Texas Legislature&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2004, UNT opened &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Texas%20Discovery%20Park\"&gt;UNT Discovery Park&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 \u2013 in Denton, north of the main campus with technology incubator facilities dedicated to science and engineering. In 2011, the College of Visual Arts and Design launched the Design Research Center in &lt;a href=\"downtown%20Dallas\"&gt;downtown Dallas&lt;/a&gt; in the Design District.\nIn 2016, UNT opened a location in Hall Park in Frisco in Collin County. In 2018, UNT opened Inspire Park. UNT teaches nearly 2,000 students in Collin County each semester at Hall Park, Inspire Park and the Collin Higher Education Center in McKinney. In 2020, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board approved UNT building a branch campus to provide upper-level and graduate courses on 100 acres donated by the city of Frisco. Classes are expected to begin in Spring 2023.\nOfficial designations.\nIn 1985 the &lt;a href=\"Mark%20White%20%28Texas%20politician%29\"&gt;Governor's&lt;/a&gt; Select Committee on Higher Education recommended that North Texas be designated an \"emerging national research university.\" Nine years earlier, in 1976, the &lt;a href=\"Carnegie%20Foundation%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Teaching\"&gt;Carnegie Foundation&lt;/a&gt; designated North Texas as a \"Class 1 Doctorate-Granting Institution.\" Four decades later, in February 2016, &lt;a href=\"Carnegie%20Foundation%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Teaching\"&gt;Carnegie&lt;/a&gt; elevated North Texas to its top category \u2013 Doctorate-Granting Institutions with \"highest research activity.\" At that time, Carnegie had 115 universities listed at that level.\nIn 1988, U.S. Secretary of Education &lt;a href=\"William%20Bennett\"&gt;William Bennett&lt;/a&gt; cited UNT for its innovative approach to undergraduate education in the Classic Learning Core, an integrated liberal arts curriculum similar to those usually found only in small, private colleges. In 1992, UNT was elected to full membership in the &lt;a href=\"Association%20of%20Public%20and%20Land-grant%20Universities\"&gt;Association of Public and Land-grant Universities&lt;/a&gt;. And, in 2011, the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Higher%20Education%20Coordinating%20Board\"&gt;Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board&lt;/a&gt; included UNT as one of eight Emerging Research Institutions in its accountability system.\nIn 2020, UNT achieved designation from the Department of Education as a Title III &amp; Title V Minority-Serving Institution (MSI) and as a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).\nEnrollment.\nCertified enrollment as of the fall of 2021 was 42,372, the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20largest%20Texas%20universities%20by%20enrollment\"&gt;fifth largest&lt;/a&gt; in the state. For the 2019\u201320 academic year, the university awarded 10,270 degrees. UNT awarded 459 Ph.D. degrees from fiscal years 2009 to 2011.\nAcademics.\nOf the 14 colleges and schools, UNT offers 109 bachelor's degree programs, and 94 master's and 36 doctorate degree programs.\nThe student-faculty ratio at UNT is 23:1, and 28.8 percent of its classes consist of fewer than 20 students. The most popular majors include business, management, marketing, communication, journalism, English, multi/interdisciplinary studies, and visual and performing arts.\nUNT has been a member of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Association%20of%20Colleges%20and%20Schools\"&gt;Southern Association of Colleges and Schools&lt;/a&gt; since 1924 and is among the twenty-seven universities in Texas at Level VI, the highest level. As of 2020, the university was home to 22 research centers and institutes. In 2007, the university launched four Institutes of Research Excellence: (i) Advanced Environmental Research Institute, (ii) Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Processes Institute, (iii) BioDiscovery Institute, and (iv) Jim McNatt Institute for Logistics Research. In 2019, UNT launched the Center for Agile and Adaptive Additive Manufacturing.\nCollege of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences.\nThe College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences houses 22 academic departments and programs and five public services (including a psychology clinic and a speech and hearing clinic), and eight student services (of which seven are labs).\nCollege of Science.\nUNT has been offering Bachelor of Science degrees for years, Master of Science degrees (in biology, mathematics, chemistry, and economics) for years, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in several scientific disciplines\u2014including chemistry, biology, and physics\u2014for years. UNT is a sponsoring institution member (Ph.D.-granting) of &lt;a href=\"Oak%20Ridge%20Associated%20Universities\"&gt;Oak Ridge Associated Universities&lt;/a&gt; (ORAU), a consortium of 105 major research universities that leverage scientific research through partnerships with national laboratories, government agencies, and private industry. It has been a member of the consortium since 1954.\nG. Brint Ryan College of Business.\nThe College of Business is host to five academic departments: (i) Accounting, (ii) Finance, Insurance, Real Estate and Law, (iii) Information Technology and Decision Sciences, (iv) Marketing, Logistics, and Operations Management (v) Management. It offers seven undergraduate programs, fourteen M.B.A. and master of science programs, and six Ph.D. programs. In Fall 2011, the college moved into a new state-of-the-art &lt;a href=\"Leadership%20in%20Energy%20and%20Environmental%20Design\"&gt;Gold LEED certified&lt;/a&gt; $70\u00a0million facility named the \"Business Leadership Building.\" The college is accredited in both business and accounting by the &lt;a href=\"Association%20to%20Advance%20Collegiate%20Schools%20of%20Business\"&gt;Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business&lt;/a&gt;\u2014accreditation for the former stretches back years (1961) and the latter, years (1987).\nThe college of business was renamed in 2019 to the G. Brint Ryan College of Business following a gift from alumnus G. Brint Ryan, alumnus and UNT System Board of Regents Chairman. The $30 million gift awarded by Ryan and his wife Amanda will create at least six endowed chairs and provide funding for academic program initiatives over seven years. Among the areas of focus are taxation and tax research, entrepreneurship, finance, logistics, information technology, cybersecurity and behavioral accounting.\nUndergraduate business education.\nIn 2018, 5,093 students were enrolled as business majors at the undergraduate level.\nGraduate business education.\nIn 2018, 691 students were working on graduate degrees. The college is host to two research centers (ii) the Institute of Petroleum Accounting and (iii) the Murphy Center for Entrepreneurship.\n\"&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report\"&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;'s\" \"2021 Best Online Programs\" ranked UNT 31st in the nation among the Best Online Graduate Business Programs.\nCollege of Education.\nThe College of Education is a legacy of the university's founding as a teachers college years ago. The college is organized as four departments and one center: (i) Counseling and Higher Education, (ii) Educational Psychology, (iii) Kinesiology, Health Promotion and Recreation, (iv) Teacher Education and Administration, and (v) The Kristin Farmer Autism Center. The college offers 12 bachelor's degrees, 19 master's degrees and 15 doctoral concentrations. As of the 2010\u20132011 school year, the college certified over 1,147 teachers, the second largest number in the state by a university. years ago (March 1979), the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Higher%20Education%20Coordinating%20Board\"&gt;Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board&lt;/a&gt; approved renaming the \"School of Education\" to the \"College of Education.\" At that time, the college was the largest in Texas and the Southwest, the largest doctoral program in the state, and the twenty-fifth largest producer of teacher certificates in the United States. Its prior name, \"School of Education,\" dates back to 1946, when the teachers college outgrew itself and reorganized as six schools and colleges. The doctor of education program is in its year and the masters program is in its year.\nCollege of Engineering.\nThe College of Engineering, founded in 2003, inherited longstanding programs (i) Computer Science, (ii) Information Technology, and (iii) Engineering Technology\u2014with majors in (a) Construction Engineering Technology, (b) Electronics Engineering Technology, (c) Manufacturing Engineering Technology, (d) Mechanical Engineering Technology, and (e) Nuclear Engineering Technology\u2014and launched (iv) Computer Engineering, (v) Electrical Engineering, (vi) Materials Science and Engineering, (vii) Mechanical Engineering, and (viii) Biomedical Engineering (2014). The college is host to three research centers, one of which being the &lt;a href=\"Net-Centric\"&gt;Net-Centric&lt;/a&gt; Software and Systems Center (launched February 24, 2009), a research consortium hosted by UNT and organized as a &lt;a href=\"National%20Science%20Foundation\"&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt; Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (NSF I/UCRC). It is primarily funded by industry members (which consist of 16 corporations) and universities (which consist of 5). The focus is developing computing models for the future\u2014models that go beyond applications with preordained fixed capabilities\u2014models capable of services that are dynamically created, verified, and validated &lt;a href=\"Field%20research\"&gt;in the field&lt;/a&gt; and .\nCollege of Information.\nThe College of Information was created in October 2008 by consolidating two existing academic units: Learning Technologies (formerly within the College of Education) and the School of Library and Information Sciences. The School of Library and Information Services was created in 1970 as an outgrowth of its former structure as the Department of Library Services. The college sponsors three research centers, one being The Texas Center for Digital Knowledge.\nCollege of Merchandising, Hospitality and Tourism.\nThe College of Merchandising, Hospitality and Tourism houses the largest merchandising program in the nation and one of the largest hospitality and tourism management programs. The college offers bachelor's degrees with majors in digital retailing, home furnishings merchandising, hospitality management, event design &amp; experience management, and merchandising, and master's degrees in hospitality management, international &lt;a href=\"sustainable%20tourism\"&gt;sustainable tourism&lt;/a&gt; and merchandising. It has the nation's first bachelor's in digital retailing and master's in international sustainable tourism. The college was formerly known as the School of Merchandising and Hospitality Management.\nCollege of Music.\nThe &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20North%20Texas%20College%20of%20Music\"&gt;College of Music&lt;/a&gt; is a comprehensive institution of international rank. Its heritage dates back years, when North Texas was founded. The college has the largest enrollment of any music institution accredited by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Association%20of%20Schools%20of%20Music\"&gt;National Association of Schools of Music&lt;/a&gt;. It has been among the largest music institutions of higher learning in North America since the 1940s. The &lt;a href=\"music%20library\"&gt;music library&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 1941, has one of the largest music collections in the United States, with over 300,000 volumes of books, periodicals, scores, and approximately 900,000 sound recordings. North Texas was first in the world to offer a degree in jazz studies. \"&lt;a href=\"U.S.%20News%20and%20World%20Report\"&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;\" ranked the jazz studies program as the best in the country every year from 1994, when it began ranking graduate jazz programs, to 1997, when it retired the category. The &lt;a href=\"One%20O%27Clock%20Lab%20Band\"&gt;One O'Clock Lab Band&lt;/a&gt; has been nominated for 7 &lt;a href=\"Grammy%20Awards\"&gt;Grammy Awards&lt;/a&gt;.\nCollege of Health and Public Service.\nPreviously called the College of Public Affairs and Community Service (PACS) and before that the College of Community Service, the college adopted its current name in Fall 2017. The college is organized in seven departments: Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology; Behavior Analysis; Criminal Justice; Emergency Management and Disaster Science; Public Administration; Rehabilitation and Health Services; and Social Work.\nThe department of public administration is home of the nation's first comprehensive degree program in &lt;a href=\"Emergency%20management\"&gt;emergency and disaster management&lt;/a&gt; that launched years ago (1983). The degree incorporates interdisciplinary curricula from other colleges that include &lt;a href=\"applied%20philosophy\"&gt;applied philosophy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"environmental%20ethics\"&gt;environmental ethics&lt;/a&gt;. The degree is tailored for both management practitioners and researchers and is collaborative with the &lt;a href=\"Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency\"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; Region VI\u2014based in Denton\u2014which oversees Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Denton became home to FEMA when its predecessor, the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Civil%20Defense\"&gt;Office of Civil Defense and Mobilization&lt;/a&gt;, constructed the nation's first Federal underground defense center in 1959.\nThe college is host to five research institutes, one being the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20Institute%20for%20Police%20Studies\"&gt;Turkish Institute for Police Studies&lt;/a&gt; (TIPS). The institute has, since its founding in 1999, been based at North Texas. Its institution is a collaboration between the &lt;a href=\"Turkish%20National%20Police\"&gt;Turkish National Police&lt;/a&gt; (TNP) and U.S. universities in areas of terrorism, organized crime, narcotics, administration, intelligence, and investigation.\nUNT and &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Women%27s%20University\"&gt;Texas Women's University&lt;/a&gt; began a joint &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Social%20Work\"&gt;Master of Social Work&lt;/a&gt; (M.S.W.) program in 2017.\nCollege of Visual Arts and Design.\nThe College of Visual Arts and Design has the 10th largest enrollment of any art and design school accredited by the &lt;a href=\"National%20Association%20of%20Schools%20of%20Art%20and%20Design\"&gt;National Association of Schools of Art and Design&lt;/a&gt;, and the second largest of any that awards doctorates. The college name changes reflect the curricular expansion of programs. In 1992, what then had been the \"Department of Art\" within the College of Arts and Sciences, became \"School of Visual Arts;\" and in 2007, it became the \"College of Visual Arts and Design.\" Art classes began at UNT in 1894, four years after its founding. Master's degrees were initiated in the 1930s and the first Master of Science degree in art was awarded in 1937. Since 1972, the college has served as curator and custodian of the &lt;a href=\"Texas%20Fashion%20Collection\"&gt;Texas Fashion Collection&lt;/a&gt; that was started by &lt;a href=\"Stanley%20Marcus\"&gt;Stanley Marcus&lt;/a&gt; in 1938.\nHonors College.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Honors%20College\"&gt;Honors College&lt;/a&gt; offers academic enrichments, including honors seminars and exclusive classes only for high-achieving undergraduates. There is no age limit. Its classes can either supplement or substitute core coursework. Its objective is to challenge exceptional students at higher levels and to promote leadership. The college is an autonomous collegiate unit on equal footing with the other collegiate units. Academically, it offers no degrees; but its courses are integrated with the &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%27s%20degree\"&gt;baccalaureate&lt;/a&gt; programs of the other ten constituent colleges and the journalism school. Graduates are awarded a special medallion. The college offers many perks, including scholarships, exchange programs, and exclusive housing\u2014Honors Hall.\nThe college began as an honors program years ago (Fall 1971). Its initial enrollment of 50, back then, quickly grew to 400. But the program lost support under a system of borrowing faculty members. The Honors Program was reconstituted in 1994 and was elevated as a college in 2005.\nMayborn School of Journalism.\nCurricular journalism at North Texas dates back to 1945. As a department, Journalism eventually became part of the College of Arts and Sciences. The Graduate Division of Journalism began in the fall of 1970 under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Conway%20Westmorland\"&gt;Reginald Conway Westmorland&lt;/a&gt;, PhD (born 1926). In 1999, twelve years after the death of &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Mayborn\"&gt;Frank W. Mayborn&lt;/a&gt;, its graduate program was renamed the Frank W. Mayborn Graduate Institute of Journalism. On September 1, 2009, the entire program was elevated as its own collegiate unit and named the Frank W. and Sue Mayborn School of Journalism. Eight &lt;a href=\"Pulitzer%20Prizes\"&gt;Pulitzer Prizes&lt;/a&gt; have been won by five of its alumni, among whom are &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Moyers\"&gt;Bill Moyers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Howard%20Swindle\"&gt;Howard Swindle&lt;/a&gt;. Other notable alumni include &lt;a href=\"Samir%20Husni\"&gt;Samir Husni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cragg%20Hines\"&gt;Cragg Hines&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1969, the news-editorial sequence has been accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications; and since 1986, the entire program has been accredited. The school is in its year as founding host of the annual Mayborn Literary Nonfiction Conference.\nVirginia Ellison \"(n\u00e9e\" Virginia Jones Paty; 1920\u20132009)\u2014a North Texas alumna (BA, English, '41) who also taught English and journalism, sponsored the Student Press Club, and served as director of publicity at North Texas from 1942 to 1944\u2014won a &lt;a href=\"Pulitzer%20Traveling%20Fellowship\"&gt;Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; in 1945, the year she earned a degree from the &lt;a href=\"Columbia%20University%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Journalism\"&gt;Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism&lt;/a&gt;.\nTexas Academy of Mathematics and Science.\nTAMS is a two-year residential early college entrance program that has, since 1987, served exceptionally qualified Texas students who otherwise would be attending high school as juniors and seniors. It was the first of its kind in the nation and, , the only in the state and one of five in the nation.\nToulouse Graduate School.\nThe Toulouse Graduate School, founded years ago, is the academic custodian and administrator of all graduate programs offered by nine colleges and one school. It maintains records, administers admissions, and serves various roles in recruiting. It was renamed in 1990 in honor of Robert Bartell Toulouse, EdD (1918\u20132017), who joined in 1948 as a professor in the College of Education, then served dean of the Graduate School from 1954 to 1982. Toulouse, before retiring as professor \"emeritus\", had served other roles at the university, including provost and vice president of academic affairs from 1982 to 1985.\nLibraries.\nUNT Libraries are made up of four public service points and two remote storage facilities. Willis Library is the main library on campus, housing the business, economics, education, humanities and social sciences collections along with microforms and special areas such as the Music Library, Government Documents, the Digital Library Division, Archives, and the Rare Book and Texana collections. The Media Library in Chilton Hall houses a large collection of audiovisual materials, including films, audiobooks, and video games (see &lt;a href=\"%23College%20of%20Engineering\"&gt;Game Design&lt;/a&gt;, above). Video recording equipment and gaming consoles are available for checkout. The Sycamore Library houses the government documents, law, political science, geography and business collections. It also houses the Collaboration and Learning Commons, a place to study in groups, create multi-media projects, and record presentations. The Discovery Park Library supports the College of Engineering and the College of Information, Library Science, and Technologies. It covers multiple areas of engineering, library and information science, and learning technology.\nThe Intensive English Language Institute (IELI).\nEstablished in 1977, IELI is the largest intensive English program (IEP) in &lt;a href=\"North%20Texas\"&gt;North Texas&lt;/a&gt;, serving international students who wish to learn &lt;a href=\"English%20for%20academic%20purposes\"&gt;academic English&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for university studies in the United States. IELI is a constituent of UNT International Affairs, an interdisciplinary unit and exponent of globalization in higher education that provides leadership and support of international teaching, research, and &lt;a href=\"Study%20abroad%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;study-abroad&lt;/a&gt; initiatives. , IELI has been located in Marquis Hall on the UNT &lt;a href=\"Denton%2C%20Texas\"&gt;Denton&lt;/a&gt; campus.\nStudent life.\nResidential life.\nAll freshmen are required to live on campus to satisfy a residency requirement. 15.5% of students, or 5,620, live in on-campus residence halls. In addition, 37.3%, or 13,494, live within the city of Denton while 4,021, or 11.1% live outside of the city of Denton but within Denton County and 36.1% or 13,043 students live outside of Denton County.\nStudent residence halls.\nThere are 15 residence halls on the Denton campus. UNT also offers the Residents Engaged in Academic Living (REAL) Communities program. The REAL communities offer students the ability to live with other residents in their major, and allow them to interact with each other and participate in programs that are geared toward their major or discipline. On August 22, 2011, -year-old Maple Street Hall became the first &lt;a href=\"vegan\"&gt;all-vegan&lt;/a&gt; (\"Mean Greens\") college cafeteria in the country. The given 14 residence hall at the University of North Texas are : Bruce Hall, Clark Hall, College Inn, Crumley Hall, Joe Greene Hall, Honors Hall, Kerr Hall, Legends Hall, Maple Hall, Mozart Square, Rawlins Hall, Santa Fe Square, Traditions Hall, Victory Hall, West Hall.\nPohl Recreation Center.\nThe Pohl Recreation Center is the student recreation center located on the campus of the University of North Texas.\nSocial Greek organizations.\nThe social Greek community is made-up of four councils that oversee 42 fraternities and sororities. Four percent of undergraduate students of both genders are members of social fraternities and sororities.\nTraditions.\nPrimary colors.\nNorth Texas adopted &lt;a href=\"Shades%20of%20green\"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt; and White as its official primary colors during the 1902\u20131903 school year. \nMascot.\nUNT's mascot, the American &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;, was adopted on February 1, 1922, as a result of a student-faculty council debate and ensuing student election.\nThe eagle has had three nicknames, beginning with \"Scrappy\" in 1950. The human costumed eagle character, launched in 1963, carried the name \"Scrappy\" until 1974\u2014during the throes of the &lt;a href=\"Vietnam%20War\"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;\u2014when students adopted the name \"Eppy\" because it sounded less warlike. Since then, the name has switched back and forth, from Eppy to Scrappy; but for the last years, the name \"Scrappy\" has endured.\nIn the spring of 2002, a student group attempted to make the &lt;a href=\"Albino%20squirrels\"&gt;albino squirrel&lt;/a&gt; the school's secondary mascot. The student body narrowly rejected the measure. In August 2006, the albino squirrel, believed to bring luck to students who spotted him before an exam, was killed by a red-tailed hawk. By May 2007, another albino squirrel had been born on campus but was hit by a car in December 2016.\nNickname for intercollegiate athletics.\nThe name \"Mean Green,\" now in its year, was adopted by fans and media in 1966 for a North Texas football defensive squad that finished the season second in the nation against the &lt;a href=\"Rush%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;rush&lt;/a&gt;. That season, &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Greene%20%28American%20football%29\"&gt;Joe Greene&lt;/a&gt;, then a sophomore at North Texas, played left &lt;a href=\"defensive%20tackle\"&gt;defensive tackle&lt;/a&gt; on the football team and competed in track and field (&lt;a href=\"shot%20put\"&gt;shot put&lt;/a&gt;). The nickname \"Mean Joe Greene\" caught-on during his first year with the &lt;a href=\"Pittsburgh%20Steelers\"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt; in 1969 when Pittsburgh fans wrongly assumed that \"Mean Green\" was derived from a nickname Joe Greene had inherited while at North Texas. The North Texas athletic department, media, and fans loved the novelty of the national use of its nickname, and its association with Joe Greene's surname and university's official school color. By 1968, \"Mean Green\" was branded on the backs of shirts, buttons, bumper stickers, and the cover of the North Texas football brochure.\nFight song.\nFrancis Edwin Stroup, EdD (1909\u20132010), emerged in 1939\u2014ten years after graduating from North Texas\u2014as the winning composer (lyrics and music) of a university sponsored &lt;a href=\"fight%20song\"&gt;fight song&lt;/a&gt; competition organized by &lt;a href=\"Floyd%20Graham\"&gt;Floyd Graham&lt;/a&gt;. He taught summers at North Texas from 1939 to 1942. The song, \"Fight, North Texas,\" has endured for years and the lyrics have changed minimally to reflect the name changes of the university. While serving as an associate professor at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Wyoming\"&gt;University of Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; from 1946 to 1950, Stroup rewrote the lyrics for the chorus to \"&lt;a href=\"Ragtime%20Cowboy%20Joe\"&gt;Ragtime Cowboy Joe&lt;/a&gt;,\" which was adopted in 1961 as the university's fight song. After serving as head of the Physical Education Department at &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Arkansas%20University\"&gt;Southern Arkansas University&lt;/a&gt; from 1950 to 1959, Stroup became Professor of Physical Education at &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Illinois%20University\"&gt;Northern Illinois University&lt;/a&gt;. While there, Stroup rewrote the lyrics to the chorus of Alonzo Neil Annas' (1882\u20131966) NIU \"Loyalty Song\" (1942), which was informally adopted in 1961 and officially 1963 as the \"Huskie Fight Song.\" Stroup also composed songs for &lt;a href=\"Drake%20University\"&gt;Drake University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. A collegiate academician who played piano mostly by ear and neither majored nor worked in music, Stroup lived to be 101, a number exceeding the songs he composed by one digit. Stroup was inducted in the Halls of Fame of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Illinois%20University\"&gt;Northern Illinois University&lt;/a&gt; and the University of North Texas (1987).\nAlma mater.\nIn 1919, &lt;a href=\"Julia%20Smith%20%28composer%29\"&gt;Julia Smith&lt;/a&gt; (1905\u20131989), while a music student, and Charles Kirby Langford (1903\u20131931), then a third-year letterman on the football team and an outstanding overall athlete, composed \"Glory to the Green and White\" which was adopted as the school's alma mater in 1922. Smith wrote the music and Langford wrote the lyrics.\nOther traditions.\nThe Spirit Bell\u2014a bell brought from &lt;a href=\"Michigan\"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; in 1891\u2014was a curfew bell from 1892 to 1928. The Talons, a spirit and service organization formed in 1960, acquired it in the 1964, mounted it on a wagon, and began the tradition of running it around the football field to rally fans. It was retired to the University Union in 1982 after it developed a crack. A similar Spirit Bell is currently in use at games. A different organization by the name \"Talons\" was founded in 1926 as the first social fraternity at North Texas.\nOn Homecoming Fridays, the Talons light a bonfire built from wooden &lt;a href=\"pallets\"&gt;pallets&lt;/a&gt;, typically in a 40-by-40-by-25-foot-height structure. The tradition has endured since the 1930s.\n\"Boomer\" is a cannon fired by the Talons at football games since the 1970s. It is a 7/8th scale &lt;a href=\"M1841%20Mountain%20Howitzer\"&gt;M1841&lt;/a&gt; 6 pound, smooth bore &lt;a href=\"muzzleloader\"&gt;muzzleloader&lt;/a&gt;, resting on hand-crafted solid oak from the campus. Talon alumni have restored it three times, the most recent being in the Fall of 2007, adding a custom for transport and equipment.\nThe Mean Green Machine, a green and black 1931 &lt;a href=\"Ford%20Model%20A%20%281927%E2%80%931931%29\"&gt;Ford Model A&lt;/a&gt; Tudor Sedan, is driven by the Talons Motorpool Committee at football games and special events. It was donated by alumnus Rex Cauble in 1974. In 2012, a team of engineering students installed a NetGain WarP 9 electric engine. , the Mean Green Machine has been re-equipped with a modified Model A engine after complications with the electric engine.\nMcConnell Tower, the clock tower atop the Hurley Administration Building at the center of campus, is bathed in green light for victories. The clock is depicted on the official class ring with two different times on its faces: 1:00 (for the &lt;a href=\"One%20O%27Clock%20Lab%20Band\"&gt;One O'Clock Lab Band&lt;/a&gt;) and 7:00\u2014the curfew initiated in 1892.\nThe eagle talon hand signal is formed by curling the thumb and index and middle fingers forward\u2014the ring and pinkie fingers stay closed against the palm.\n\"In High Places,\" is a tall bronze statue of a flying eagle created by &lt;a href=\"Gerald%20Balciar\"&gt;Gerald Balciar&lt;/a&gt; and dedicated during the university's centennial in 1990.\nBroadcast, print, and digital media.\nBroadcast.\n&lt;a href=\"KNTU\"&gt;KNTU&lt;/a&gt; (88.1 FM), licensed and owned by the university and operated by students, has, for years, broadcast to the North Texas region. Jazz has always been a feature of the station; but in 1981, it became the predominant format. KNTU began broadcasting in stereo in 1986 and, on March 22, 1988, increased its broadcasting power from 6,700 watts to 100,000, extending its reach to about a 60-mile radius from its tower located on the Denton campus. KNTU is part of the Mean Green Radio Network, which reaches 10 million listeners.

It is produced by UNT students and exclusively features works\u2014art, poetry, fiction, non-fiction\u2014by UNT students.\nStudent yearbooks through the years have included \"Cotton-tail\" (1906), \"Yucca\" (1907\u20131974), \"Wings\" (1977\u20131980), and \"Aerie\" (1982\u20132007). \"Aerie\" ceased publication after the 2007 edition, following a trend of the digital age cited by \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Economist\"&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;\" in 2008.\nNorth Texas is the home of \"&lt;a href=\"American%20Political%20Science%20Review\"&gt;American Political Science Review&lt;/a&gt;\" . The journal moves among national universities every four to six years. UNT will be the first university in the South or Southwest to house the publication. \nThe \"&lt;a href=\"North%20Texas%20Daily\"&gt;North Texas Daily&lt;/a&gt;\" is the official university daily newspaper, staffed by students. Print issues are published Tuesday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and weekly during the summer.
