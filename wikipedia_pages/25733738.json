    "text": "Jeffery Renard Allen (born 1962 &lt;a href=\"Chicago\"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;) is an American &lt;a href=\"poet\"&gt;poet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"essayist\"&gt;essayist&lt;/a&gt;, short story writer, and &lt;a href=\"novelist\"&gt;novelist&lt;/a&gt;. He is the author of two collections of poetry, \"Harbors and Spirits\" (Moyer Bell, 1999) and \"Stellar Places\" (Moyer Bell, 2007), and three works of fiction, the novel \"Rails Under My Back\" (&lt;a href=\"Farrar%2C%20Straus%2C%20and%20Giroux\"&gt;Farrar, Straus, and Giroux&lt;/a&gt;, 2000), a story collection \"Holding Pattern\" (&lt;a href=\"Graywolf%20Press\"&gt;Graywolf Press&lt;/a&gt;, 2008) and a second novel, \"&lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20the%20Shank\"&gt;Song of the Shank&lt;/a&gt;\" (Graywolf Press, 2014). In writing about his fiction, reviewers often note his lyrical use of language and his playful use of form to write about African-American life. His poems tend to focus on music, mythology, history, film, and other sources, rather than narrative or autobiographical experiences.\nEarly life.\nJeffery Renard Allen was born in 1962 in Chicago, and raised on the &lt;a href=\"South%20Side%2C%20Chicago\"&gt;South Side of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, a neighborhood that he says informs the setting of his first novel \"Rails Under My Back\" and the stories in his collection \"Holding Pattern\". For Allen, the 1980s in Chicago and other black communities across America represented an \"apocalyptic moment\" with the introduction of crack cocaine and the violence and other forms of destruction and devastation it brought, experiences that he feels have been underrepresented in literary fiction. (Source: interview with Michael Antonucci)\nAllen attended public schools in Chicago, then completed all of his university education at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Chicago\"&gt;University of Illinois at Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, where he holds a Ph.D. in English (Creative Writing).\nCareer.\nHe is a professor in the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Virginia\"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt;'s Creative Writing Program on paid administrative leave as of January 2019. Allen's administrative leave resulted from his November 8, 2018 arrest. He was charged with felony strangulation and misdemeanor simple domestic battery. A family member said she had been choked by him to the point where she felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe.

In 2006, he taught for the Kwani? Literary festival in &lt;a href=\"Nairobi%2C%20Kenya\"&gt;Nairobi, Kenya&lt;/a&gt;.
