He has drawn all his life and became interested in nature as a small child. He began drawing &lt;a href=\"animals\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt; more seriously only at the age of twenty. Between 1996 and 2001, he worked in nature conservation, first in &lt;a href=\"BirdLife%20Hungary\"&gt;BirdLife Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, then on the Washington Convention (&lt;a href=\"CITES\"&gt;CITES&lt;/a&gt;). In 2001, he became a full-time wildlife artist and illustrator. He has no formal art training. He worked with acrylics in the early years, but around 2005 he changed to watercolours, gouache and oils. He uses watercolours for looser styled paintings, for field studies and combined with gouache for illustration work. His bigger, more detailed, paintings are done in oils. He regularly works in the field to have first-hand references. He regularly takes part in international exhibitions and competition. He has been an exhibitor at the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Wildlife%20Artists\"&gt;Society of Wildlife Artists&lt;/a&gt;' annual exhibition in &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, and at the Birds in Art exhibition of the &lt;a href=\"Leigh%20Yawkey%20Woodson%20Art%20Museum\"&gt;Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum&lt;/a&gt;."
