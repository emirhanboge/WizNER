    "text": "Google Arts &amp; Culture (formerly Google Art Project) is an online platform of high-resolution images and videos of artworks and cultural artifacts from partner cultural organizations throughout the world.\nIt utilizes high-resolution image technology that enables the viewer to tour partner organization collections and galleries and explore the artworks' physical and contextual information. The platform includes advanced search capabilities and educational tools.\nDevelopment.\nThe platform emerged as a result of Google's \"20-percent time\" policy, by which employees were encouraged to spend 20% of their time working on an innovative project of interest. A small team of employees created the concept for the platform after a discussion on how to use the firm's technology to make museum' artwork more accessible. The platform concept fit the firm's mission \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\" Accordingly, in mid-2009, Google executives agreed to support the project, and they engaged online curators of numerous museums to commit to the initiative.\nThe platform was launched on February 1, 2011 by the &lt;a href=\"Google%20Cultural%20Institute\"&gt;Google Cultural Institute&lt;/a&gt; with contributions from international museums, including the &lt;a href=\"Tate%20Gallery\"&gt;Tate Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;; and the &lt;a href=\"Uffizi\"&gt;Uffizi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;. On April 3, 2012, Google announced a major expansion, with more than 34,000 artworks from 151 museums and arts organizations from 40 countries, including the &lt;a href=\"Art%20Gallery%20of%20Ontario\"&gt;Art Gallery of Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"White%20House\"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;, the Australian Rock Art Gallery at &lt;a href=\"Griffith%20University\"&gt;Griffith University&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Islamic%20Art%2C%20Doha\"&gt;Museum of Islamic Art, Doha&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hong%20Kong%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Hong Kong Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;.\nTechnology used.\nThe team leveraged existing technologies, including &lt;a href=\"Google%20Street%20View\"&gt;Google Street View&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Picasa\"&gt;Picasa&lt;/a&gt;, and built new tools specifically for the platform.\nThey created an indoor-version of the camera system to capture gallery images by pushing the camera 'trolley' through a museum. It also used professional panoramic heads Clauss Rodeon VR Head Hd And Clauss VR Head ST to take high-resolution photos of the artworks within a gallery. This technology allowed the excellent attention to detail and the highest image resolution. Each partner museum selected one artwork to be captured at ultra-high resolution with approximately 1,000 times more detail than the average digital camera. The largest image, &lt;a href=\"Alexander%20Andreyevich%20Ivanov\"&gt;Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov&lt;/a&gt;'s \"The Apparition of Christ to the People\", is over 12 gigapixels. To maximize image quality, the team coordinated with partner museums' lighting technicians and photography teams. For example, at the &lt;a href=\"Tate%20Britain\"&gt;Tate Britain&lt;/a&gt;, they collaborated to capture a gigapixel image of \"&lt;a href=\"No%20Woman%20No%20Cry%20%28painting%29\"&gt;No Woman No Cry&lt;/a&gt;\" in both natural light and in the dark. The Tate suggested this method to capture the painting's hidden phosphorescent image, which glows in the dark. The Google camera team had to adapt their method and keep the camera shutter open for 8 seconds in the dark to capture a distinct enough image. Now, unlike at the Tate, from the site, one can view the painting in both light settings.\nOnce the images were captured, the team used Google Street View software and GPS data to seamlessly stitch the images and connect them to museum floor plans. Each image was mapped according to longitude and latitude, so that users can seamlessly transition to it from Google Maps, looking inside the partner museums' galleries. Street View was also integrated with Picasa, for a seamless transition from gallery view to microscope view.\nThe user interface lets site visitors virtually 'walk through' galleries with Google Street View, and look at artworks with Picasa, which provides the microscope view to zoom in to images for greater detail than is visible to the naked eye. Additionally, the microscope view of artworks incorporates other resources\u2014including &lt;a href=\"Google%20Scholar\"&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Google%20Docs\"&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"YouTube\"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;\u2014so users can link to external content to learn more about the work. Finally, the platform incorporates Google's URL shortener (&lt;a href=\"Google%20URL%20Shortener\"&gt;Goo.gl&lt;/a&gt;), so that users can save and easily share their personal collections.\nThe platform has been integrated with the social media platform Google+ to enable users to share their personal collections with their networks. This integration also lets site visitors use Google+ Hangouts for more interactive purposes. These situations might include: a professor giving an online lecture to students, engaging in video and shared-screen discussions about a collection, or an expert leading a virtual tour of a distant museum to remote attendees.\nThe resulting platform is a Java-based Google App Engine Web application, which exists on Google's infrastructure.\nTechnology limitations.\n&lt;a href=\"Luc%20Vincent\"&gt;Luc Vincent&lt;/a&gt;, director of engineering at Google and head of the team responsible for Street View for the platform, stated concern over the quality of panorama cameras his team used to capture gallery and artwork images. In particular, he believes that improved aperture control would enable more consistent quality of gallery images.\nSome artworks were particularly difficult to capture and re-present accurately as virtual, two-dimensional images. For example, Google described the inclusion of &lt;a href=\"Hans%20Holbein%20the%20Younger\"&gt;Hans Holbein the Younger&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ambassadors%20%28Holbein%29\"&gt;The Ambassadors&lt;/a&gt;\" as \"tough\". This was due to the &lt;a href=\"Anamorphosis\"&gt;anamorphic&lt;/a&gt; techniques distorting the image of a skull in the foreground of the painting. When looking at the original painting at the National Gallery in London, the depiction of the skull appears distorted until the viewer physically steps to the side of the painting. Once the viewer is looking at the shape from the intended vantage point, the lifelike depiction of the skull materializes. The effect is still apparent in the gigapixel version of the painting, but was less pronounced in the \"walk-through\" function.\nAs \"New York Times\" art reviewer &lt;a href=\"Roberta%20Smith\"&gt;Roberta Smith&lt;/a&gt; said: \"[Google Arts &amp; Culture] is very much a work in progress, full of bugs and information gaps, and sometimes blurry, careering virtual tours.\" Though the second-generation platform solved some technological issues, the firm plans to continue developing additional enhancements for the site. Future improvements currently under consideration include: upgrading panorama cameras, more detailed web metrics, and improved &lt;a href=\"Search%20Engine%20Optimization\"&gt;searchability&lt;/a&gt; through meta-tagging and user-generated meta-tagging. The firm is also considering the addition of an experimental page to the platform, to highlight emerging technologies that artists are using to showcase their works.\nInstitutions and works.\nSeventeen partner museums were included in the launch of the project. The original 1,061 high-resolution images (by 486 different artists) are shown in 385 virtual gallery rooms, with 6,000 &lt;a href=\"Street%20View\"&gt;Street View&lt;/a&gt;\u2013style panoramas.\nList of the initial 17 partner museums.\nBelow is a list of the original seventeen partner museums at the time of the platform's launch. All images shown are actual images from Google Arts &amp; Culture:\nOn April 3, 2012, Google announced the expansion of the platform to include 151 cultural organizations, with new partners contributing a gigapixel image of one of their works.\nPartial list of Google Cultural Institute partners.\nThe museum image redirects to the museum's official page on the Google Arts &amp; Culture platform, the Google Street View logo indicates that the museum has an adapted version of Street View\nInfluences.\nThe Google Art Project was a development of the &lt;a href=\"virtual%20museum\"&gt;virtual museum&lt;/a&gt; projects of the 1990s and 2000s, following the first appearance of online exhibitions with high-resolution images of artworks in 1995. In the late 1980s, art museum personnel began to consider how they could exploit the &lt;a href=\"internet\"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; to achieve their institutions' missions through online platforms. For example, in 1994 Elizabeth Broun, Director of the &lt;a href=\"Smithsonian%20American%20Art%20Museum\"&gt;Smithsonian American Art Museum&lt;/a&gt;, spoke to the Smithsonian Commission on the future of art, stating: \"We need to put our institutional energy behind the idea of getting the Smithsonian hooked up to the people and schools of America.\" She then outlined the museum's objective to conserve, protect, present, and interpret exhibits, explaining how electronic media could help achieve these goals. The expansion of internet programs and resources has shaped the development of the platform.\nContemporary Google initiatives.\nAnother Google initiative\u2014&lt;a href=\"Google%20Books\"&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt;\u2014affected the development of the platform from a non-technological perspective. Google faced a six-year-long court case relating to several &lt;a href=\"Authors%20Guild%20v.%20Google\"&gt;issues with copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt;. Google Books cataloged full digital copies of texts, including those still protected by copyright, though Google claimed it was permissible under the &lt;a href=\"fair%20use\"&gt;fair use&lt;/a&gt; clause. Google ended up paying $125 million to copyright-holders of the protected books, though the &lt;a href=\"Google%20Books%23Settlement%20agreement\"&gt;settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt; was modified and debated several times before it was ultimately rejected by federal courts. In his decision, Judge Denny Chin stated the settlement agreement would \"give Google a significant advantage over competitors, rewarding it for engaging in wholesale copying of copyrighted works without permission,\" and could lead to antitrust issues. Judge Chin said in future open-access initiatives, Google should use an \"opt-in\" method, rather than providing copyright owners the option to \"opt out\" of an arrangement.\nAfter this controversy, Google took a different approach to intellectual property rights for the Google Arts &amp; Culture. The platform's intellectual property policy is:\nThe Google team was sensitive to copyright issues of artworks, and partner museum staff were able to ask Google to blur out the images of certain works, which are still protected by copyrights. In a few cases, museums wanted to include artworks by modern and contemporary artists, many of whom still hold the copyright to their work. For example, the Tate Britain approached &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Ofili\"&gt;Chris Ofili&lt;/a&gt; to get his permission to capture and reproduce his works on the platform.\nHowever, since the project expanded in April 2012, Google has faced a few intellectual property issues. Some of the works added to the online exhibitions are still protected by &lt;a href=\"copyright\"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt;, as the artist or his or her heirs holds the right to the image for 70 years. As a result, the &lt;a href=\"Toledo%20Museum%20of%20Art\"&gt;Toledo Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt; asked Google to remove 21 artworks from the website, including works by &lt;a href=\"Henri%20Matisse\"&gt;Henri Matisse&lt;/a&gt; and other modern artists.\nGoogle Cultural Institute.\n, the contents of the project were accessible from Google Cultural Institute, an initiative unveiled by &lt;a href=\"Google\"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; following the 2011 launch of Google Arts &amp; Culture (known as \"Google Art Project\" at the time of launch).\nThe Cultural Institute was launched in 2011 with 42 new exhibits online on October 10, 2012. The Cultural Institute strove \"to make important cultural material available and accessible to everyone and to digitally preserve it to educate and inspire future generations.\" As of June 2013, it included over 6 million items - photos, videos, and documents.\nThe initiative has partnered with a number of institutions to make exhibition and archival content available online, including the &lt;a href=\"British%20Museum\"&gt;British Museum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yad%20Vashem\"&gt;Yad Vashem&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Museo%20Galileo\"&gt;Museo Galileo&lt;/a&gt; in Florence, &lt;a href=\"Center%20for%20Jewish%20History\"&gt;Center for Jewish History&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, &lt;a href=\"Auschwitz-Birkenau%20State%20Museum\"&gt;Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Polish%20History\"&gt;Museum of Polish History&lt;/a&gt; in Warsaw. The earliest notable project was a searchable archive and online digital exhibition series, in partnership with the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory, which allowed people to access &lt;a href=\"Nelson%20Mandela\"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt;'s personal diaries and previously unreleased drafts of his manuscripts for the sequel to his autobiography &lt;a href=\"Long%20Walk%20to%20Freedom\"&gt;Long Walk to Freedom&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to Google Arts &amp; Culture, the Cultural Institute includes the World Wonders Project, which presents three-dimensional recreations of world heritage sites, and archival exhibitions, many in partnership with museums around the world. It also features digitized objects from archives, libraries, and a wider array of museums not strictly devoted to art.\nReception.\nThe Google Arts &amp; Culture stirred up debate among scholars, museum personnel, art critics, and news writers. Since its initial launch, it has received fairly consistent positive feedback and a variety of criticism. With the second generation platform, Google appears to have responded to some earlier criticisms.\nPraise.\nPositive feedback about the platform has centered on an increased audience gaining access to art, the marketing &lt;a href=\"externality\"&gt;externality&lt;/a&gt; for museums, and the potential for the future development of the initiative.\nThe Google Arts &amp; Culture is, according to some, a democratic initiative. It aims to give more people access to art by removing barriers like cost and location. Some art or cultural exhibits have been limited to a small group of viewers (e.g. PhD students, academic researchers) due to deteriorating conditions of work, lack of available wall space in a museum, or other similar factors. Digitized reproductions, however, can be accessible to anyone from any location. This type of online resource can transform research and academia by opening access to previously exclusive artworks, enabling multidisciplinary and multi-institutional learning. It provides people the opportunity to experience art individually, and a platform to become involved in the conversation. For example, the platform now lets users &lt;a href=\"%23Site%20components\"&gt;contribute&lt;/a&gt; their own content, adding their insight to the public collection of knowledge.\nMany scholars have argued that we are experiencing a breakdown of the canon of high art, and the Google Arts &amp; Culture is beginning to reflect this. When it just included the Grand Masters of Western Art, the project faced strong &lt;a href=\"%23Criticism\"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of this outburst, the website now includes some indigenous and graffiti artworks. This platform also provides a new context through which people encounter art, ultimately reflecting this shift away from the canon of high art.\nCriticism.\nA few initial criticisms of the platform, including the skewed representation of artworks, have lost some validity with the launch of the second generation platform.\nAlthough the firm may have responded to this issue, there are other neglected criticisms:\nTimeline of introductions.\nAll of these museums have an adapted version of Google Street View designed to photograph building interiors.\nSimilar initiatives.\nMany museums and arts organizations have created their own online data and &lt;a href=\"Online%20exhibition\"&gt;virtual exhibitions&lt;/a&gt;. Some offer virtual 3-D tours similar to the Google Arts &amp; Culture's gallery view, whereas others simply reproduce images from their collection on the institution's web page. Some museums have collections that exist solely in cyberspace and are known as &lt;a href=\"virtual%20museum\"&gt;virtual museum&lt;/a&gt;s."
