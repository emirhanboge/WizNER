    "text": "\"Orange Trees\" is a song by Welsh singer and songwriter &lt;a href=\"Marina%20Diamandis\"&gt;Marina&lt;/a&gt; from her fourth studio album, \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20%2B%20Fear\"&gt;Love + Fear&lt;/a&gt;\" (2019). The song was released for &lt;a href=\"Music%20download\"&gt;digital download&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Streaming%20media\"&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; as the album's third &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; on 22 March 2019 by &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Records\"&gt;Atlantic Records&lt;/a&gt;. It was written by Marina, &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20G%C3%B6rres\"&gt;Oscar G\u00f6rres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Hassle\"&gt;Erik Hassle&lt;/a&gt;, and Jakob Jerlstrom, while produced by G\u00f6rres. Several remixes of the song were commissioned by Atlantic and released throughout 2019, including one produced by German DJ &lt;a href=\"Claptone\"&gt;Claptone&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"Acoustic%20music\"&gt;acoustic&lt;/a&gt; version of \"Orange Trees\" appears on Marina's sixth extended play, \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20%2B%20Fear%20%28Acoustic%29\"&gt;Love + Fear (Acoustic)&lt;/a&gt;\" (2019). Musically, the song has been described as an &lt;a href=\"electropop\"&gt;electropop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"indie%20pop\"&gt;indie pop&lt;/a&gt; track, with a &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20music\"&gt;tropical&lt;/a&gt; beat and lyrics that describe a summer romance spent in the beauty of nature. Marina wrote the song about the island city of &lt;a href=\"Lefkada%20%28city%29\"&gt;Lefkada&lt;/a&gt;, Greece, where her family once lived. \n\"Orange Trees\" received generally mixed reviews from &lt;a href=\"Music%20journalism\"&gt;music critics&lt;/a&gt;. Some considered the song a standout or compared it to Marina's previous single \"&lt;a href=\"Handmade%20Heaven\"&gt;Handmade Heaven&lt;/a&gt;\", a track that also discusses nature in its lyrics, while other critics dismissed it as inferior to other \"Love + Fear\" tracks. Two accompanying &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt;s were produced and the original video was released alongside the song, directed by &lt;a href=\"Sophie%20Muller\"&gt;Sophie Muller&lt;/a&gt;, and filmed at a private villa in &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Vallarta\"&gt;Puerto Vallarta&lt;/a&gt;. It depicts Marina adventuring and exploring the property with several friends. A &lt;a href=\"vertical%20video\"&gt;vertical video&lt;/a&gt; was released in April 2019, featuring Marina singing while wearing a large, flower &lt;a href=\"headpiece\"&gt;headpiece&lt;/a&gt;. To promote the song, Marina performed it on \"&lt;a href=\"Late%20Night%20with%20Seth%20Meyers\"&gt;Late Night with Seth Meyers&lt;/a&gt;\" that same month. The song was also included on the setlist of her fourth concert tour, the Love + Fear Tour (2019).\nBackground and release.\nTo mark the beginning of a new era in her career, Marina stated via &lt;a href=\"Twitter\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 that she would be dropping \"and the Diamonds\" from her stage name in order to release music as just Marina (stylised in &lt;a href=\"all%20caps\"&gt;all caps&lt;/a&gt;). She explained that, \"It took me well over a year to figure out that a lot of my identity was tied up in who I was as an artist... and there wasn't much left of who \"I\" was.\" After the announcement, Marina released \"&lt;a href=\"Baby%20%28Clean%20Bandit%20song%29\"&gt;Baby&lt;/a&gt;\" with &lt;a href=\"Clean%20Bandit\"&gt;Clean Bandit&lt;/a&gt;, her first &lt;a href=\"Single%20%28music%29\"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; under her new name. On 14 February 2019, she announced \"Love + Fear\", her fourth studio album and first as Marina. The track listing was unveiled the same day, revealing \"Orange Trees\" as the third track on the album. \"Love + Fear\" serves as a &lt;a href=\"double%20album\"&gt;double album&lt;/a&gt; that is composed of two segments, with each one exploring psychologist &lt;a href=\"Elisabeth%20K%C3%BCbler-Ross\"&gt;Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross&lt;/a&gt;' theory that humans are only capable of experiencing the aforementioned two emotions. \"Orange Trees\" appears on the \"Love\" portion of the album, devoted to lyrics detailing positive thoughts and emotions, because it was categorised as a song about \"her sense of home\". The song was written by Marina, &lt;a href=\"Oscar%20G%C3%B6rres\"&gt;Oscar G\u00f6rres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Hassle\"&gt;Erik Hassle&lt;/a&gt;, and Jakob Jerlstrom, while G\u00f6rres handled production. Marina recorded her vocals for the song at &lt;a href=\"Maratone%20Studios\"&gt;Wolf Cousins Studios&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stockholm\"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Orange Trees\" was released for &lt;a href=\"Music%20download\"&gt;digital download&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Streaming%20media\"&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; as a single in the United States on 22 March 2019 through &lt;a href=\"Atlantic%20Records\"&gt;Atlantic Records&lt;/a&gt;. On that same day via &lt;a href=\"Spotify\"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; in the US, the song was bundled with previous singles \"&lt;a href=\"Handmade%20Heaven\"&gt;Handmade Heaven&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Superstar%20%28Marina%20song%29\"&gt;Superstar&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of a digital extended play to stream. In Russia, the song was released as a single for airplay and serviced to &lt;a href=\"contemporary%20hit%20radio\"&gt;contemporary hit radio&lt;/a&gt; stations beginning on 1 April 2019. A &lt;a href=\"Promotional%20recording\"&gt;promotional CD single&lt;/a&gt; for \"Orange Trees\", intended for radio airplay, was distributed throughout the &lt;a href=\"Benelux\"&gt;Benelux&lt;/a&gt; region of Europe by Atlantic Records and the &lt;a href=\"Warner%20Music%20Group\"&gt;Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt;. It features the album version of the song plus four remixes, released in advance of their digital distributions.\nAtlantic commissioned a total of four remixes to be made for \"Orange Trees\". They all first appeared on the Benelux promotional CD, but were then released separately for digital download snd streaming; the first one, the Danny Dove remix, was released on 19 April 2019. The Bearson remix and &lt;a href=\"Claptone\"&gt;Claptone&lt;/a&gt; remix followed, being released on 31 May and 7 June 2019, respectively. The Michael Goldwasser &amp; Easy Star All-Stars Reggae remix was the last one, released for digital download and streaming on 14 June. An &lt;a href=\"Acoustic%20music\"&gt;acoustic&lt;/a&gt; version of the song was recorded and included on the track listing for Marina's sixth EP, \"&lt;a href=\"Love%20%2B%20Fear%20%28Acoustic%29\"&gt;Love + Fear (Acoustic)&lt;/a&gt;\", on 13 September 2019. It was produced by English musician Benjamin Fletcher.\nComposition and lyrics.\nMusically, \"Orange Trees\" is a romantic and \"breezy\" &lt;a href=\"electropop\"&gt;electropop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"indie%20pop\"&gt;indie pop&lt;/a&gt; song, with a &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20music\"&gt;tropical&lt;/a&gt; beat. Lauren Murphy from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Irish%20Times\"&gt;The Irish Times&lt;/a&gt;\" referred to the beat as an \"infectious summer groove\". Similarly, John Murphy from \"&lt;a href=\"musicOMH\"&gt;musicOMH&lt;/a&gt;\" said the &lt;a href=\"Refrain\"&gt;chorus&lt;/a&gt; is \"suitably summery\" when considering the song's lyrical subject matter. \"&lt;a href=\"Classic%20Pop%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Classic Pop&lt;/a&gt;\"s Wyndham Wallace described the genre of the song as \"understated electro-pop\", while he considered Marina's vocals to sound \"demure\" and reserved.\nAccording to Musicnotes.com, \"Orange Trees\" is set in &lt;a href=\"Time%20signature\"&gt;common time&lt;/a&gt; and has a moderate &lt;a href=\"tempo\"&gt;tempo&lt;/a&gt; of 101 beats per minute. The key of the song is in &lt;a href=\"B%20major\"&gt;B major&lt;/a&gt;, with Marina's vocal range spanning an entire &lt;a href=\"octave\"&gt;octave&lt;/a&gt;, from F3 to G4 in &lt;a href=\"scientific%20pitch%20notation\"&gt;scientific pitch notation&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the song's three verses, the vocal range advances in the &lt;a href=\"chord%20progression\"&gt;chord progression&lt;/a&gt; of E\u2013F\u266f\u2013E-F\u266f\u2013B/D\u266f. Instrumentation for the song is provided by Hassle, who plays the guitar, and G\u00f6rres, who plays keyboards and percussion. The song was &lt;a href=\"Audio%20engineer\"&gt;engineered&lt;/a&gt; by John Hanes, while &lt;a href=\"Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29\"&gt;mixed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Serban%20Ghenea\"&gt;Serban Ghenea&lt;/a&gt;. Marina provided her own background vocals for the song and &lt;a href=\"Mastering%20%28audio%29\"&gt;mastering&lt;/a&gt; was handled by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City\"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.\nLyrically, \"Orange Trees\" uses vivid &lt;a href=\"imagery\"&gt;imagery&lt;/a&gt; and serves as \"an ode to the beauty of Earth's natural wonders\". According to Marina, the song is about the island city of &lt;a href=\"Lefkada%20%28city%29\"&gt;Lefkada&lt;/a&gt; in Greece, where her family originated from. Regarding her decision to write a song about the town, she said: \"it's my favourite place in the world. I always feel at peace there. It's like my body/biology recognises I\u2019m back home.\" Lake Schatz from \"&lt;a href=\"Consequence%20of%20Sound\"&gt;Consequence of Sound&lt;/a&gt;\" summarized the song's message as being \"about embracing and becoming one with all the beauty that nature has to offer\". Lucas Villa from &lt;a href=\"AXS%20%28company%29\"&gt;AXS&lt;/a&gt; described the lyrics as \"picturesque\" and compared them to the ones of \"Handmade Heaven\". Marina opens the song by singing \"O-o-o-orange / O-o-o-orange / O-o-o-orange\" over a beat without the use of a &lt;a href=\"sustain%20pedal\"&gt;sustain pedal&lt;/a&gt;. She then transitions into the first verse, where she describes: \"I can see the flowers in the greenery / I take a breath of air and I feel free\". During the song's &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20%28music%29\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt;, Marina sings \"Life is beautiful and now you see / This is how it feels to be free,\" which Villa felt alluded to a summer romance in Marina's personal life.\nCritical reception.\nBen Niesen from \"&lt;a href=\"Atwood%20Magazine\"&gt;Atwood Magazine&lt;/a&gt;\" considered \"Orange Trees\" to be one of the most \"'powerful' moments\" on \"Love + Fear\" and called it \"probably the most colourful cut\" overall. Lauren Murphy also liked the track, grouping it with several other songs on the album that she felt were \"uplifting and empowering\". David Renshaw from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fader\"&gt;The Fader&lt;/a&gt;\" raved about the song, describing it as \"an &lt;a href=\"upbeat\"&gt;upbeat&lt;/a&gt; song perfect for sunny days and long, balmy nights\". &lt;a href=\"Idolator%20%28website%29\"&gt;Idolator&lt;/a&gt;'s Mike Wass was equally positive in his review of the song: \"It's achingly lovely and definitive proof that the 33-year-old doesn\u2019t need to be in the depths of despair to make great &lt;a href=\"pop%20music\"&gt;pop music&lt;/a&gt;.\" The acoustic version of the song was reviewed by several critics. Mike Nied from Idolator described it as his \"personal favorite\" and the \"absolute standout\" on \"Love + Fear (Acoustic)\". Although Riana Buchman from &lt;a href=\"WRBB\"&gt;WRBB&lt;/a&gt; was mixed in her review of the EP, she felt \"Orange Trees\" succeeded as the album's closing track and called it the sole highlight.\nThe more negative reviews of \"Orange Trees\" referred to it as boring or unmemorable. \"&lt;a href=\"NME\"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt;\" reviewer Douglas Greenwood provided a mixed review of the song, saying that it \"might be more of a swig of &lt;a href=\"Fanta\"&gt;Fanta&lt;/a&gt; than a sip of fancy &lt;a href=\"S.Pellegrino\"&gt;San Pellegrino&lt;/a&gt;, but there's something about its carefree nature that makes it difficult to hate.\" In his review of \"Love + Fear\", Peyton Thomas from \"&lt;a href=\"Pitchfork%20%28website%29\"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt;\" called the track \"anodyne\" and preferred album cut \"Too Afraid\". Also, Nick Lowe from \"&lt;a href=\"Clash%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Clash&lt;/a&gt;\" was unimpressed by the track, referring to it as Marina's \"half-hearted attempt [at] a chart-topping summer hit\".\nMusic videos.\nThe original &lt;a href=\"music%20video\"&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; for \"Orange Trees\" was directed by English director &lt;a href=\"Sophie%20Muller\"&gt;Sophie Muller&lt;/a&gt;, who had previously collaborated with Marina on the video for \"Handmade Heaven\". The visual was filmed on location in &lt;a href=\"Puerto%20Vallarta\"&gt;Puerto Vallarta&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Jalisco\"&gt;Jalisco&lt;/a&gt;, Mexico at a private villa and beach. It was later announced that the music video would be released at 10:00 AM (&lt;a href=\"Pacific%20Time%20Zone\"&gt;PST&lt;/a&gt;) on 22 March 2019. Ultimately, it was uploaded to Marina's official &lt;a href=\"YouTube\"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; account on the scheduled date. The video opens following Marina as she walks around a beachfront property in Puerto Vallarta. The next scene shows her lounging in an &lt;a href=\"infinity%20pool\"&gt;infinity pool&lt;/a&gt; with two female friends; for the first chorus, she is joined by her friends on the beach, as they hold hands and dance in the waves. A different shot has Marina posed in a green dress in front of a wall of flowers. Other scenes show her dancing in the sand of the beach in a &lt;a href=\"one-piece%20swimsuit\"&gt;one-piece swimsuit&lt;/a&gt; and standing on a dock while gazing at the surrounding water. Many of the shots in the video were edited with a color filter to bring out a strong orange &lt;a href=\"hue\"&gt;hue&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlongside the YouTube release of the music video, it was made available for download via &lt;a href=\"Apple%20Music\"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; on 22 March 2019. Villa wrote a positive review of the visual, calling it a \"colorful video\". A contributor for \"&lt;a href=\"Billboard%20%28magazine%29\"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt;\" also enjoyed it, writing that the video \"positively radiates with summer sunshine\" and summarising it as a \"feel-good clip\". A separate &lt;a href=\"vertical%20video\"&gt;vertical video&lt;/a&gt;, also directed by Muller, was created. It features Marina singing the song in an orange dress and a &lt;a href=\"headpiece\"&gt;headpiece&lt;/a&gt; containing many flowers. The video was eventually uploaded to her YouTube channel on 12 April 2019.\nLive performances.\nIn 2019, Marina was featured on &lt;a href=\"NBC\"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Late%20Night%20with%20Seth%20Meyers\"&gt;Late Night with Seth Meyers&lt;/a&gt;\" as the guest musical artist, standing as her first appearance on the show since 2015. She appeared on the 8 April episode and performed \"Orange Trees\" to the audience. Schatz was positive in his review of the performance, writing: \"Though the stage itself was without any &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; or natural daylight, the &lt;a href=\"London\"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;-based artist carried plenty of warmth and spiritual uplift in her body language and, quite literally, in her hair.\"\nThe song was also included on the set list for Marina's Love + Fear Tour in 2019. It was performed in between her 2015 single \"&lt;a href=\"Froot%20%28song%29\"&gt;Froot&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Electra%20Heart\"&gt;Electra Heart&lt;/a&gt;\" track \"Teen Idle\" (2012). During this segment of the show, Marina and her background dancers began to engage in more theatrics. Roman Gokhman from \"Riff\", reviewing Marina's show in &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, called the live performance of \"Orange Trees\" a highlight of the show. He complimented her ability to \"bend [...] the tone of her voice to a near &lt;a href=\"vibrato\"&gt;vibrato&lt;/a&gt;\", which he considered a trademark of the older releases in her discography.\nCredits and personnel.\nSong.\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Love + Fear\".\nMusic video.\nCredits adapted from Marina's YouTube account.\nProduction\nPersonnel"
