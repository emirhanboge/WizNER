    "text": "Sporotrichosis, also known as rose handler's disease, is a &lt;a href=\"fungal%20infection\"&gt;fungal infection&lt;/a&gt; that affects skin, lungs, bone and joint, and can be widespread. It presents with firm painless &lt;a href=\"Nodule%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;nodules&lt;/a&gt; that later &lt;a href=\"ulceration\"&gt;ulcerate&lt;/a&gt;. It can be localized or widespread. The disease progresses over a week to several months after the initial exposure to the fungus. Serious complications can also develop in people who have a &lt;a href=\"immunosuppression\"&gt;weakened immune system&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is caused by mainly the &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Sporothrix%20schenckii\"&gt;Sporothrix schenckii&lt;/a&gt;\", and others. Because \"S. schenckii\" is naturally found in soil, &lt;a href=\"hay\"&gt;hay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sphagnum%20moss\"&gt;sphagnum moss&lt;/a&gt;, and plants, it usually affects &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s, gardeners, and agricultural workers. It enters through small cuts in the skin to cause the infection. In case of sporotrichosis affecting the lungs, the fungal spores enter by &lt;a href=\"inhalation\"&gt;breathing in&lt;/a&gt;. Sporotrichosis can also be acquired from handling cats with the disease; it is an occupational hazard for veterinarians.\nTreatment depends on the site and extent of infection. Topical &lt;a href=\"antifungals\"&gt;antifungals&lt;/a&gt; can be applied to skin lesions. Deep infection in lungs may require surgery. Medications used include &lt;a href=\"Itraconazole\"&gt;Itraconazole&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"posaconazole\"&gt;posaconazole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"amphotericin%20B\"&gt;amphotericin B&lt;/a&gt;. With treatment most people recover. The outcome may not be so good if there is a weak immune system or widespread disease.\nThe causal fungus is found worldwide. The species was named for Benjamin Schenck, a medical student who in 1896 was the first to isolate it from a human specimen.\nIt has been reported in cats, mules, dogs, mice and rats.\nSigns and symptoms.\nComplications.\nCutaneous lesions can become superinfected with bacteria, resulting in &lt;a href=\"cellulitis\"&gt;cellulitis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiagnosis.\nSporotrichosis is a &lt;a href=\"chronic%20%28medicine%29\"&gt;chronic&lt;/a&gt; disease with slow progression and often subtle symptoms. It is difficult to diagnose, as many other diseases share similar symptoms and therefore must be ruled out.\nPatients with sporotrichosis will have &lt;a href=\"antibodies\"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; against the fungus \"S. schenckii\", however, due to variability in sensitivity and specificity, it may not be a reliable diagnosis for this disease. The confirming diagnosis remains culturing the fungus from the skin, &lt;a href=\"sputum\"&gt;sputum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"synovial%20fluid\"&gt;synovial fluid&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cerebrospinal%20fluid\"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;. Smears should be taken from the draining tracts and ulcers.\nCats with sporotrichosis are unique in that the exudate from their lesions may contain numerous organisms. This makes cytological evaluation of exudate a valuable diagnostic tool in this species. Exudate is pyogranulomatous and phagocytic cells may be packed with yeast forms. These are variable in size, but many are cigar-shaped.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nDifferential diagnosis includes: &lt;a href=\"leishmaniasis\"&gt;leishmaniasis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nocardiosis\"&gt;nocardiosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mycobacterium%20marinum\"&gt;mycobacterium marinum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cat-scratch%20disease\"&gt;cat-scratch disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leprosy\"&gt;leprosy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"syphilis\"&gt;syphilis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sarcoidosis\"&gt;sarcoidosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tuberculosis\"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrevention.\nThe majority of sporotrichosis cases occur when the fungus is introduced through a cut or puncture in the skin while handling vegetation containing the fungal spores. Prevention of this disease includes wearing long sleeves and gloves while working with soil, hay bales, rose bushes, pine seedlings, and sphagnum moss. Also, keeping cats indoors is a preventative measure.\nTreatment.\nTreatment of sporotrichosis depends on the severity and location of the disease. The following are treatment options for this condition:\nOther animals.\nSporotrichosis can be diagnosed in domestic and wild mammals. In veterinary medicine it is most frequently seen in cats and horses. Cats have a particularly severe form of cutaneous sporotrichosis and also can serve as a source of zoonotic infection to persons who handle them and are exposed to exudate from skin lesions."
