    "text": "Mudville is a &lt;a href=\"Brooklyn\"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, NY-based band and artist &lt;a href=\"collective\"&gt;collective&lt;/a&gt; whose sound, a hybrid of &lt;a href=\"downtempo\"&gt;downtempo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"electronica\"&gt;electronica&lt;/a&gt;, Memphis-style &lt;a href=\"soul%20music\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jazz\"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; was dubbed, \"post-&lt;a href=\"trip%20hop\"&gt;trip hop&lt;/a&gt;\" by John Donohue of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Yorker\"&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;\". Core members Marilyn Carino and Ben (Benny Cha Cha) Rubin have distinguished themselves as adding sophistication to the genre with classic &lt;a href=\"Hip%20hop%20music\"&gt;Hip hop&lt;/a&gt; stylings, elements of improvisational &lt;a href=\"free%20jazz\"&gt;free jazz&lt;/a&gt; and attention to songcraft more influenced by &lt;a href=\"Marvin%20Gaye\"&gt;Marvin Gaye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Ellington\"&gt;Duke Ellington&lt;/a&gt; than the minimalist, pop-based structure and lyrics by which the genre is most often characterized. The \"&lt;a href=\"New%20York%20Post\"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;\" has lauded Mudville's \"poetic lyrics, filled with imagery\" and \"otherworldly, blues-jazz feel\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Time%20Out%20New%20York\"&gt;Time Out New York&lt;/a&gt;\" characterized the band's live sound as \"brainy, extended improvs... a potent fusion of jazz and space-rock.\nHistory.\nThe brainchild of bassist/producer Rubin and vocalist/songwriter Carino, Mudville began in &lt;a href=\"San%20Francisco\"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; as a more straightforward rock band that prominently featured &lt;a href=\"Hammond%20B3%20organ\"&gt;Hammond B3 organ&lt;/a&gt;. One independently-released CD was recorded in 1997 under Marilyn Carino's name, titled \"Long Island Lulu\". \nUpon relocating to New York in 2000, Carino and Rubin began collaborating on songs with Carino writing lyrics and melodies and Rubin producing tracks using a combination of painstakingly-arranged live instruments and digital &lt;a href=\"Sampling%20%28music%29\"&gt;sampling&lt;/a&gt;. Carino is known for her \"serious chops\", sultry, limber &lt;a href=\"contralto\"&gt;contralto&lt;/a&gt; voice and expressive phrasing which is often compared to &lt;a href=\"Annie%20Lennox\"&gt;Annie Lennox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nina%20Simone\"&gt;Nina Simone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Vaughan\"&gt;Sarah Vaughan&lt;/a&gt;, and for her poetic, progressive-minded prose, which has drawn comparisons to that of &lt;a href=\"Radiohead\"&gt;Radiohead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"R.E.M.\"&gt;R.E.M.&lt;/a&gt;. She has also co-written and sung on tracks produced by &lt;a href=\"Sly%20and%20Robbie\"&gt;Sly and Robbie&lt;/a&gt;.\nBenny Cha Cha has been a bassist for numerous Jazz and Rock greats, including &lt;a href=\"Ronnie%20Cuber\"&gt;Ronnie Cuber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Frisell\"&gt;Bill Frisell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Campilongo\"&gt;Jim Campilongo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moby\"&gt;Moby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marshall%20Crenshaw\"&gt;Marshall Crenshaw&lt;/a&gt;, and has distinguished himself as a &lt;a href=\"remix\"&gt;remix&lt;/a&gt; artist who has worked with the &lt;a href=\"Wu-Tang%20Clan\"&gt;Wu-Tang Clan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Killah%20Priest\"&gt;Killah Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karsh%20Kale\"&gt;Karsh Kale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brazilian%20Girls\"&gt;Brazilian Girls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe duo have recorded an &lt;a href=\"Extended%20play\"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt;, 2003's four-song \"Mudville\", which featured one track, \"High Rise\", that was co-produced by &lt;a href=\"Billy%20Talbot\"&gt;Billy Talbot&lt;/a&gt;, bassist of &lt;a href=\"Neil%20Young%20and%20Crazy%20Horse\"&gt;Neil Young and Crazy Horse&lt;/a&gt;, and two full-length recordings; 2005's \"The Glory of Man is Not in Vogue\", which was lauded as \"Enchanting... a testament to the healing powers of rhythm\" and \"A captivating and emotionally charged album\" and 2007's \"Iris Nova\", which features an eclectic array of artists, including &lt;a href=\"R.E.M.\"&gt;R.E.M.&lt;/a&gt; bassist &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Mills\"&gt;Mike Mills&lt;/a&gt; on piano, &lt;a href=\"Telecaster\"&gt;Telecaster&lt;/a&gt; maestro &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Campilongo\"&gt;Jim Campilongo&lt;/a&gt; on guitar, percussionist/producer &lt;a href=\"Karsh%20Kale\"&gt;Karsh Kale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Dylan\"&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt; pedal-steel guitarist &lt;a href=\"Buddy%20Cage\"&gt;Buddy Cage&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ethel%20%28string%20quartet%29\"&gt;Ethel&lt;/a&gt; string quartet and saxophonist and former &lt;a href=\"The%20Lounge%20Lizards\"&gt;Lounge Lizard&lt;/a&gt; Michael Blake. \"American Songwriter\" magazine called \"Iris Nova\" \"a pageantry of maturing sounds and measures, confident attitudes and different genres\" and Rhapsody deemed it \"a perfect melding, as if Nina Simone came back from the dead to front Morcheeba on a new record\". \nIn 2015, the band released a new track, \"Someone Else,\" which served as the end credits music for director Nelson Kim's debut feature film \"Someone Else.\" \nMudville's live band since 2005 has consisted of John Walter Bollinger on drums and Brian Charette on keyboards and guitar.\nMudville is also known for collaborations with artists of many disciplines, doing experimental projects with up-and-coming New York videographers and clothing designers and also performing with a contortionist.\nIn 2008, they won Best Dance/Electronica Song at the Independent Music Awards with their song \"Wicked\".\nDiscography.\nBen Rubin and Marilyn Carino as \"Marilyn Carino\" \nAs Mudville\"\nMarilyn Carino solo recordings"
