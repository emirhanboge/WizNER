    "text": "The Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (; MESAN) was a political party in the &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic\"&gt;Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt;. In its original form, it was a nationalist quasi-religious party that sought to affirm &lt;a href=\"Black%20people\"&gt;black humanity&lt;/a&gt; and advocated for the independence of &lt;a href=\"Ubangi-Shari\"&gt;Ubangi-Shari&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"French%20colonial%20territory\"&gt;French colonial territory&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe party, which was initially intended to work as a political movement, was founded by &lt;a href=\"Barth%C3%A9lemy%20Boganda\"&gt;Barth\u00e9lemy Boganda&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bangui\"&gt;Bangui&lt;/a&gt;, Ubangi-Shari (later known as the &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Republic\"&gt;Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt;) on 28 September 1949, to connect \"all the Blacks of the world\" and \"to promote the political, economic and social evolution of black Africa, to break down the barriers of tribalism and racism, to replace the degrading notion of colonial subordination with the more human ones of fraternity and cooperation.\"\nThe statutes of the movement were written in April 1950, and the group's branches were set up in &lt;a href=\"Ubangui\"&gt;Ubangui&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"N%27Djamena\"&gt;Fort Lamy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brazzaville\"&gt;Brazzaville&lt;/a&gt;. The formation of MESAN did not sit well with the French territorial administration. They set up divisions of the &lt;a href=\"Rally%20of%20the%20French%20People\"&gt;Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais&lt;/a&gt; (French People's Party, also known as RPF) in Ubangi-Shari to oppose the MESAN. The movement also encountered resistance in &lt;a href=\"French%20Equatorial%20Africa\"&gt;French Equatorial Africa&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Rassemblement%20D%C3%A9mocratique%20Africain\"&gt;Rassemblement D\u00e9mocratique Africain&lt;/a&gt; (African Democratic Rally, RDA), a political party initially geared towards &lt;a href=\"Pan-Africanism\"&gt;Pan-Africanism&lt;/a&gt; that later became hostile towards efforts for African independence.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"1957%20Ubangi-Shari%20Territorial%20Assembly%20election\"&gt;Territorial Assembly elections&lt;/a&gt; in 1957, MESAN captured 347,000 out of the total 356,000 votes cast and won every legislative seat, which led to Boganda being elected president of the Grand Council of &lt;a href=\"French%20Equatorial%20Africa\"&gt;French Equatorial Africa&lt;/a&gt; and vice-president of the Ubangi-Shari Government Council. Within a year, he declared the establishment of the Central African Republic and served as the country's first prime minister. MESAN continued to exist, but its role was limited. After Boganda's death in a plane crash on 29 March 1959, his cousin, &lt;a href=\"David%20Dacko\"&gt;David Dacko&lt;/a&gt;, took control of MESAN. The party won every seat in the &lt;a href=\"1959%20Central%20African%20Republic%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1959 elections&lt;/a&gt;, with Dacko becoming the country's first president after the CAR formally received &lt;a href=\"independence\"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt; from France. Dacko threw out his political rivals, including former Prime Minister and &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Evolution%20Movement%20of%20Central%20Africa\"&gt;Mouvement d'\u00e9volution d\u00e9mocratique de l'Afrique centrale&lt;/a&gt; (MEDAC) leader &lt;a href=\"Abel%20Goumba\"&gt;Abel Goumba&lt;/a&gt;, who he forced into exile in France. With all opposition parties suppressed by November 1962, Dacko declared MESAN as the official party of the state. MESAN won every seat again in the &lt;a href=\"1964%20Central%20African%20Republic%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1964 elections&lt;/a&gt;, whilst Dacko was re-elected as President in an &lt;a href=\"1964%20Central%20African%20Republic%20presidential%20election\"&gt;unopposed election&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 31 December 1965, General &lt;a href=\"Jean-B%C3%A9del%20Bokassa\"&gt;Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa&lt;/a&gt;, a cousin of both Boganda and Dacko, seized power in the CAR through a &lt;a href=\"coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat\"&gt;coup d'\u00e9tat&lt;/a&gt;. The next day, 1 January 1966, he proclaimed himself president, prime minister, and head of MESAN. Bokassa stayed in power for the next 13 years. In 1972, he appointed &lt;a href=\"Elisabeth%20Domitien\"&gt;Elisabeth Domitien&lt;/a&gt; as vice president of the party, and three years later as prime minister, a first for any woman of an African nation. At the MESAN congress on 4 December 1976, Bokassa instituted a new constitution and declared the &lt;a href=\"republic\"&gt;republic&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"monarchy\"&gt;monarchy&lt;/a&gt;, to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Empire\"&gt;Central African Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In September 1979, Bokassa was overthrown and Dacko once again became president of the CAR. On 24 November 1979, he abolished MESAN and replaced it with the &lt;a href=\"Central%20African%20Democratic%20Union\"&gt;Union D\u00e9mocratique Centrafricaine&lt;/a&gt;, which he proclaimed as the new political party for the CAR.\nThe party was re-established after the return of multi-party politics in the early 1990s. In the &lt;a href=\"1993%20Central%20African%20Republic%20general%20election\"&gt;1993 general elections&lt;/a&gt; it won a single seat in the &lt;a href=\"National%20Assembly%20%28Central%20African%20Republic%29\"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party nominated only one candidate for the &lt;a href=\"2011%20Central%20African%20Republic%20general%20election\"&gt;2011 elections&lt;/a&gt;, failing to win a seat."
