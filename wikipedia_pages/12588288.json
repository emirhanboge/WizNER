He appeared in six games for the Indians in 1953, winning one and losing one, before being traded on June 15 to the Tigers with &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Gromek\"&gt;Steve Gromek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Boone\"&gt;Ray Boone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dick%20Weik\"&gt;Dick Weik&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Art%20Houtteman\"&gt;Art Houtteman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Owen%20Friend\"&gt;Owen Friend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Wight\"&gt;Bill Wight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Ginsberg\"&gt;Joe Ginsberg&lt;/a&gt;.

His best statistical season was 1955, in which Aber appeared in 39 games and won six, lost three, and had an &lt;a href=\"earned%20run%20average\"&gt;earned run average&lt;/a&gt; of 3.38.

Although he's fast, he throws a 'light' ball that makes it easy on the catcher. Al Aber, another leftie on our staff, is tough to catch because he throws a 'heavy' ball.\"\nAber became a sales representative after retiring. He died in 1993 at age 65 in &lt;a href=\"Garfield%20Heights%2C%20Ohio\"&gt;Garfield Heights, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;."
