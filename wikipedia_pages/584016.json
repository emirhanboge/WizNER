    "text": "German submarine \"U-853\" was a &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20IX%20submarine%23Type%20IXC/40\"&gt;Type IXC/40&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt;\" during &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. Her keel was &lt;a href=\"Keel%20laying\"&gt;laid down&lt;/a&gt; on 21 August 1942 by &lt;a href=\"DeSchiMAG\"&gt;DeSchiMAG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"AG%20Weser\"&gt;AG Weser&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt;. She was &lt;a href=\"ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 25 June 1943 with \"&lt;a href=\"Kapit%C3%A4nleutnant\"&gt;Kapit\u00e4nleutnant&lt;/a&gt;\" Helmut Sommer in command. \"U-853\" saw action during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic\"&gt;Battle of the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; in World War II. She conducted three patrols, sinking two ships totalling 5,783 tons.\nOn her final patrol, \"U-853\" was sent to harass United States coastal shipping. She destroyed near &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, Maine. Just days before Germany's surrender, \"U-853\" torpedoed and sank the collier \"Black Point\" during the &lt;a href=\"%23Battle%20of%20Point%20Judith\"&gt;Battle of Point Judith&lt;/a&gt;. The day before Germany surrendered, American warships quickly found \"U-853\" and sank her east of &lt;a href=\"Block%20Island\"&gt;Block Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the loss of her entire crew.\n\"U-853\" is a popular &lt;a href=\"deep%20sea%20diving\"&gt;deep sea diving&lt;/a&gt; site. She rests in of water.\nDesign.\n&lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20IX%20submarine%23Type%20IXC/40\"&gt;German Type IXC/40 submarines&lt;/a&gt; were slightly larger than the original &lt;a href=\"German%20Type%20IX%20submarine%23Type%20IXC\"&gt;Type IXC&lt;/a&gt;s. \"U-853\" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20hull\"&gt;pressure hull&lt;/a&gt; length of , a &lt;a href=\"beam%20%28nautical%29\"&gt;beam&lt;/a&gt; of , a height of , and a &lt;a href=\"draught%20%28ship%29\"&gt;draught&lt;/a&gt; of . The submarine was powered by two &lt;a href=\"MAN%20SE\"&gt;MAN&lt;/a&gt; M 9 V 40/46 &lt;a href=\"supercharged\"&gt;supercharged&lt;/a&gt; four-stroke, nine-cylinder &lt;a href=\"diesel%20engine\"&gt;diesel engine&lt;/a&gt;s producing a total of for use while surfaced, two &lt;a href=\"Siemens-Schuckert\"&gt;Siemens-Schuckert&lt;/a&gt; 2 GU 345/34 &lt;a href=\"Motor%E2%80%93generator\"&gt;double-acting electric motors&lt;/a&gt; producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two &lt;a href=\"propeller\"&gt;propeller&lt;/a&gt;s. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . \"U-853\" was fitted with six &lt;a href=\"torpedo%20tube\"&gt;torpedo tube&lt;/a&gt;s (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 &lt;a href=\"torpedo\"&gt;torpedo&lt;/a&gt;es, one &lt;a href=\"10.5%20cm%20SK%20C/32%20naval%20gun\"&gt;SK C/32 naval gun&lt;/a&gt;, 180 rounds, and a &lt;a href=\"3.7%20cm%20SK%20C/30\"&gt;SK C/30&lt;/a&gt; as well as a &lt;a href=\"2%20cm%20FlaK%2030\"&gt;C/30&lt;/a&gt; anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a &lt;a href=\"Ship%27s%20company\"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; of forty-eight.\nService history.\n\"U-853\" was built by &lt;a href=\"DeSchiMAG\"&gt;DeSchiMAG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"AG%20Weser\"&gt;AG Weser&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bremen\"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt;. Ordered on 5 June 1941, her keel was laid on 21 August 1942 and she was &lt;a href=\"Ship%20commissioning\"&gt;commissioned&lt;/a&gt; on 25 June 1943.\nThe Germans nicknamed the &lt;a href=\"U-boat\"&gt;U-boat&lt;/a&gt; \"der Seilt\u00e4nzer\" (\"the Tightrope Walker\"), and her crew painted an emblem of a yellow shield with a red horse on her sail.\nFirst patrol.\nOn her first patrol from May to June 1944, \"U-853\" was assigned to weather-watching duty under the command of \"Kapit\u00e4nleutnant\" Helmut Sommer. This was its first war patrol. German intelligence believed that weather conditions in the Atlantic could be used to help predict the timing of an Allied invasion of Europe. On 25 May 1944 \"U-853\" spotted , loaded with American troops and supplies. The U-boat submerged to attack, but was outrun by the much larger and faster ship. As she surfaced in \"Queen Mary's\" wake \"U-853\" was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Fairey%20Swordfish\"&gt;Fairey Swordfish&lt;/a&gt; aircraft from British &lt;a href=\"merchant%20aircraft%20carrier\"&gt;merchant aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;s and . The U-boat took no significant damage and returned fire, hitting all three aircraft. The planes were able to return to their carrier, but after recovery one was deemed a total loss and jettisoned.\nThe escort carrier had been hunting weather boats for nearly a month and had already sunk and . Intercepted radio transmissions led \"Croatan\" and six destroyers to search for \"U-853\". The \"U-853\" proved so elusive that \"Croatan\"'s crew nicknamed their prey \"Moby Dick.\" After ten days of hunting, on 17 June &lt;a href=\"Huff-Duff\"&gt;Huff-Duff&lt;/a&gt; (HF/DF, high frequency direction finding) picked up a weather report from \"U-853\" only away. Within minutes two &lt;a href=\"FM-1%20Wildcat\"&gt;FM-1 Wildcat&lt;/a&gt; fighters &lt;a href=\"strafe\"&gt;strafe&lt;/a&gt;d the submarine, killing 2 men and wounding 12 others. Sommer suffered 28 shrapnel and bullet wounds yet still managed to give the order to submerge. In all likelihood Sommer saved his submarine from being destroyed by allied bombers.\nThree weeks of pursuit from 25 May until 17 June placed an enormous strain on \"U-853\"s crew. Twenty-three-year-old \"&lt;a href=\"Oberleutnant%20zur%20See\"&gt;Oberleutnant zur See&lt;/a&gt;\" Helmut Fr\u00f6msdorf took command of the boat on 18 June (his first command) and returned to &lt;a href=\"Lorient\"&gt;Lorient&lt;/a&gt; in northwest France. Sommer and a large number of the crew was declared unfit for duty. On 10 July Sommer was formally relieved by \"Oberleutnant zur See\" Otto Wermuth.\nSecond patrol.\nThe boat remained in port until 27 August. Decorated veteran \"&lt;a href=\"Korvettenkapit%C3%A4n\"&gt;Korvettenkapit\u00e4n&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"G%C3%BCnter%20Kuhnke\"&gt;G\u00fcnter Kuhnke&lt;/a&gt;, Commander of the &lt;a href=\"10th%20U-boat%20Flotilla\"&gt;10th U-boat Flotilla&lt;/a&gt;, took command for her second patrol.\n\"U-853\" operated this time in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Approaches\"&gt;Western Approaches&lt;/a&gt; off the British Isles, but in a period of seven weeks scored no successes. On completion she did not return to Lorient, but continued to &lt;a href=\"Flensburg\"&gt;Flensburg&lt;/a&gt;, Germany, arriving 14 October.\nKuhnke assumed command of the &lt;a href=\"33rd%20U-boat%20Flotilla\"&gt;33rd U-boat Flotilla&lt;/a&gt; upon arriving at Flensburg. He relinquished command of \"U-853\" back to Fr\u00f6msdorf, who took the U-boat on her third and final patrol. Before departure \"U-853\" was fitted with a \"&lt;a href=\"Submarine%20snorkel\"&gt;Schnorchel&lt;/a&gt;\", a retractable air intake and exhaust that allowed the ship to remain submerged while running her diesel engines. The \"Schnorchel\" reduced the need to spend dangerous periods on the surface recharging batteries.\nLast patrol.\nOn 23 February 1945 Germany sent \"U-853\" on her third war patrol to harass US coastal shipping. Under the command of \"Oberleutnant zur See\" Helmut Fr\u00f6msdorf, \"U-853\" did not sink any targets during the first weeks of her patrol. Her crossing of the Atlantic was slow because she used her \"Schnorchel\" to remain submerged to avoid being spotted by Allied aircraft. On 1 April 1945 \"U-853\" was ordered to the &lt;a href=\"Gulf%20of%20Maine\"&gt;Gulf of Maine&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 23 April she fatally torpedoed near &lt;a href=\"Portland%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Portland, Maine&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Eagle Boat 56\", a World War I-era patrol boat, was towing targets for a &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; dive-bomber training exercise off &lt;a href=\"Cape%20Elizabeth%2C%20Maine\"&gt;Cape Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; when she exploded amidships and sank. Only 13 of the 67 crew survived. That same day dropped nine depth charges on a suspected submarine. The next day made &lt;a href=\"sonar\"&gt;sonar&lt;/a&gt; contact and attacked \"U-853\", but failed to destroy her.\nAlthough several survivors claimed to have seen a submarine sail with yellow and red insignia, a Navy inquiry attributed the PE-56 sinking to a boiler explosion. The Navy reversed its findings in 2001 to acknowledge that the sinking was due to hostile fire and awarded &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Heart\"&gt;Purple Heart&lt;/a&gt;s to the survivors and next-of-kin of the deceased.\nBattle of Point Judith.\nOn 5 May 1945, &lt;a href=\"President%20of%20Germany%20%281919%E2%80%931945%29\"&gt;Reichspr\u00e4sident&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Karl%20D%C3%B6nitz\"&gt;Karl D\u00f6nitz&lt;/a&gt; ordered all U-boats to cease offensive operations and return to their bases. \"U-853\" was lying in wait off &lt;a href=\"Point%20Judith%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Point Judith, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; at the time. According to the &lt;a href=\"US%20Coast%20Guard\"&gt;US Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;, \"U-853\" did not receive that order or, less likely, ignored it. Soon after, her torpedo blew off the stern of SS \"Black Point\", a &lt;a href=\"Collier%20%28ship%20type%29\"&gt;collier&lt;/a&gt; underway from &lt;a href=\"New%20York%20City%2C%20New%20York\"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Boston%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;. Within 15 minutes \"Black Point\" had sunk in of water less than south of Point Judith. She was the last US-flagged merchant ship lost in World War II. Twelve men died and 34 crew members were rescued. One of the rescuing ships, Yugoslav freighter SS \"Kamen\", sent a report of the torpedoing to authorities. The &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Navy\"&gt;US Navy&lt;/a&gt; organized a \"hunter-killer\" group that included four American warships: , , , and .\nThe group discovered \"U-853\" bottomed in , and dropped &lt;a href=\"depth%20charge\"&gt;depth charge&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hedgehog%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;hedgehog&lt;/a&gt;s during a 16-hour attack. At first, the U-boat attempted to flee, then tried to hide by lying still. Both times it was found by sonar. On the morning of 6 May 1945 two &lt;a href=\"K-Class%20blimp\"&gt;K-Class blimp&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Lakehurst%2C%20New%20Jersey\"&gt;Lakehurst&lt;/a&gt;, New Jersey, K-16 and K-58, joined the attack, locating oil slicks and marking suspected locations with smoke and dye markers. K-16 also attacked with &lt;a href=\"Mousetrap%20%28weapon%29\"&gt;7.2-inch rocket bombs&lt;/a&gt;. Numerous depth charge and hedgehog attacks from \"Atherton\" and \"Moberly\" resulted in planking, life rafts, a chart tabletop, clothing, and an officer's cap floating to the surface. \"U-853\" was one of the last U-boats sunk during World War II and, with , the last to be sunk in US waters. \"Atherton\" and \"Moberly\" received joint credit for the kill.\nLegacy.\nThe body of one of \"U-853\"s crewmembers was recovered in 1960 and was interred in the Island Cemetery Annex on Van Zandt Avenue in &lt;a href=\"Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Newport, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;. The submarine's two propellers were on display for many years at the Inn at Castle Hill in Newport and are now in the custody of the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Naval%20War%20College\"&gt;United States Naval War College&lt;/a&gt; Museum at the &lt;a href=\"Newport%20Naval%20Station\"&gt;Newport Naval Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe USS \"Atherton\" was transferred to Japan and served as part of the &lt;a href=\"Japanese%20Maritime%20Self%20Defense%20Force\"&gt;Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force&lt;/a&gt; until 1975 when she was returned to the United States. She was given to the &lt;a href=\"Philippines\"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; in 1978 and served as &lt;a href=\"BRP%20Rajah%20Humabon%20%28PS-11%29\"&gt;BRP Rajah Humabon (PS-11)&lt;/a&gt; with the Philippine Navy until 2018.\nInterest has been expressed in returning \"Atherton\" to the United States so she can be restored to her World War II appearance and be opened to the public. \"Rajah Humabon\" was decommissioned on 15 March 2018 and is planned to be part of the Philippine Navy museum in &lt;a href=\"Sangley%20Point\"&gt;Sangley Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nWreck.\n\"U-853\" lies east of &lt;a href=\"Block%20Island\"&gt;Block Island&lt;/a&gt; in of water. The US Coast Guard pinpoints the location of the wreck at . Most of the 55 crew member bodies remain within the hull, which is a war grave. It is one of the more popular dive sites in Southern New England. The hull has depth charge blast holes: one forward of the conning tower at the radio room and another in the starboard side of the engine room. Entering the wreck is dangerous due to debris, sharp metal edges, and confined spaces.\nOn 6 and 7 May 1945, Navy divers attempted to enter the wreck to recover the captain's safe and the papers within, but failed. Recreational divers first visited the site in 1953. In 1960 a recreational diver brought up a body from the wreck. This provoked former navy admirals and clergy to petition the US government for restrictions on disturbing the dead. The German crewman was buried with full military honors in &lt;a href=\"Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island\"&gt;Newport, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of 1998 at least two recreational divers have died from exploring the wreckage. Stephen Hardick died in 2005 while filming the U-boat. He surfaced unconscious and could not be revived. Hardick, age 60, died as the result of saltwater drowning associated with poor health according to the Rhode Island Medical Examiner's office.\nArmament.\nFLAK weaponry.\n\"U-853\" was armed with a single &lt;a href=\"3.7%20cm%20Flak%2018/36/37/43\"&gt;3.7 cm Flakzwilling M43U&lt;/a&gt; gun on the LM 42U mount. The LM 42U mount was the most common mount used with the 3.7\u00a0cm Flak M42U. The 3.7\u00a0cm Flak M42U was the marine version of the 3.7\u00a0cm Flak used by the &lt;a href=\"Kriegsmarine\"&gt;Kriegsmarine&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Type%20VII\"&gt;Type VII&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Type%20IX\"&gt;Type IX&lt;/a&gt; U-boats. \"U-853\" had two &lt;a href=\"2%20cm%20Flak%2030/38/Flakvierling\"&gt;2cm Flak C38&lt;/a&gt; in a M 43U \"Zwilling\" mount with short folding shield mounted on the upper \"Wintergarten\". The M 43U mount was used on a number of U-boats (, , , , , , , , , , and )."
