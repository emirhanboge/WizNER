The cabinet was a &lt;a href=\"Centrism\"&gt;centrist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"grand%20coalition\"&gt;grand coalition&lt;/a&gt; and had a slim &lt;a href=\"majority%20government\"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Representatives%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20Christian%20Democratic%20Appeal\"&gt;Christian Democratic Leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Peter%20Balkenende\"&gt;Jan Peter Balkenende&lt;/a&gt; serving as &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20Labour%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;Labour Leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wouter%20Bos\"&gt;Wouter Bos&lt;/a&gt; served as &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Deputy Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Ministers%20of%20Finance%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Minister of Finance&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20Christian%20Union\"&gt;Social Christian Leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Rouvoet\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Rouvoet&lt;/a&gt; served as Deputy Prime Minister and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Ministers%20of%20Health%20of%20the%20Netherlands%23List%20of%20Ministers%20without%20Portfolio\"&gt;Minister without Portfolio for Health, Welfare and Sport&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cabinet served during the unstable late 2000s; domestically it had to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008\"&gt;financial crisis of 2008&lt;/a&gt; and major reforms to the &lt;a href=\"Education%20in%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;education system&lt;/a&gt;, while internationally, it had to deal with the &lt;a href=\"war%20on%20terror\"&gt;war on terror&lt;/a&gt; and the government support for the &lt;a href=\"Task%20Force%20Uruzgan\"&gt;Task Force Uruzgan&lt;/a&gt;. The cabinet suffered several major internal conflicts including multiple cabinet resignations. The cabinet fell prematurely on 20 February 2010 after the Labour Party refused to supported an extension of the Task Force Uruzgan mission with the Labour Party cabinet members resigning on 23 February 2010, and the cabinet continued in a &lt;a href=\"Demissionary%20cabinet\"&gt;demissionary&lt;/a&gt; capacity until it was replaced after the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Dutch%20general%20election\"&gt;election of 2010&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormation.\nFollowing the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Balkenende%20cabinet\"&gt;Second Balkenende cabinet&lt;/a&gt; on 30 June 2006 the &lt;a href=\"Democrats%2066\"&gt;Democrats 66&lt;/a&gt; (D66) left the coalition and the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democratic%20Appeal\"&gt;Christian Democratic Appeal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Party%20for%20Freedom%20and%20Democracy\"&gt;People's Party for Freedom and Democracy&lt;/a&gt; (VVD) formed a &lt;a href=\"rump%20cabinet\"&gt;rump cabinet&lt;/a&gt;.

After the &lt;a href=\"2006%20Dutch%20general%20election\"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democratic%20Appeal\"&gt;Christian Democratic Appeal&lt;/a&gt; (CDA) of incumbent Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Peter%20Balkenende\"&gt;Jan Peter Balkenende&lt;/a&gt; was the winner of the election but lost 3 seats and had now a total of 41 seats.

Hoekstra explored the possibilities for the different three party coalitions, since no two parties could form a majority in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Representatives%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; together. This resulted in a coalition agreement between the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Democratic%20Appeal\"&gt;Christian Democratic Appeal&lt;/a&gt; (CDA), &lt;a href=\"Labour%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; (PvdA) and the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20Union%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;Christian Union&lt;/a&gt; (CU), together these three parties had 79 seats out of 150 seats in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Representatives%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn 20 December 2006 &lt;a href=\"Beatrix%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Queen Beatrix&lt;/a&gt; appointed former &lt;a href=\"Social-Economic%20Council\"&gt;Chairman of the Social-Economic Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Herman%20Wijffels\"&gt;Herman Wijffels&lt;/a&gt; (CDA) as &lt;a href=\"Formateur\"&gt;Informateur&lt;/a&gt; to start the second information round and negotiate a &lt;a href=\"coalition%20agreement\"&gt;coalition agreement&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20Christian%20Democratic%20Appeal\"&gt;Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Peter%20Balkenende\"&gt;Jan Peter Balkenende&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20Labour%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29\"&gt;Leader of the Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wouter%20Bos\"&gt;Wouter Bos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Leader%20of%20the%20Christian%20Union\"&gt;Leader of the Christian Union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Andr%C3%A9%20Rouvoet\"&gt;Andr\u00e9 Rouvoet&lt;/a&gt;. On 7 February 2007 a coalition was reached with the motto of the agreement: \"Samen leven, samen werken\" (\"Living together, working together\"). On 9 February 2007 &lt;a href=\"Beatrix%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Queen Beatrix&lt;/a&gt; appointed incumbent Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Peter%20Balkenende\"&gt;Jan Peter Balkenende&lt;/a&gt; (CDA) as &lt;a href=\"Formateur\"&gt;Formateur&lt;/a&gt; to start the last phase of the formation. On 22 February the cabinet members were sworn in by &lt;a href=\"Beatrix%20of%20the%20Netherlands\"&gt;Queen Beatrix&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerm.\nPolicy.\nThe coalition agreement titled \"Living together, working together\" was presented on 7 February in a press conference by Balkenende, Bos, Rouvoet. It is structured into six commitments of the new cabinet. If a proposal was included in a party's electoral manifesto, this is mentioned as well.\nFall and aftermath.\nIn February 2010, &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; had officially requested the Netherlands to extend its military involvement in &lt;a href=\"Task%20Force%20Uruzgan\"&gt;Task Force Uruzgan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force\"&gt;ISAF&lt;/a&gt; operation in the Afghan province of &lt;a href=\"Uruzgan\"&gt;Uruzgan&lt;/a&gt;, aimed at training Afghan security forces and transfer of responsibilities to the local authorities. Coalition party PvdA strongly opposed the extension of the mission. The collision between the government and the parliament, of which the majority disagreed with an extension of the mission, as well as between the coalition partners in the cabinet, threatened the existence of the cabinet and led to its fall in the night between 19 and 20 February 2010, after 16 hours of deliberations between the cabinet members. The Labour members resigned from the cabinet.\nAs queen Beatrix was on holiday in Austria (&lt;a href=\"Lech%20am%20Arlberg\"&gt;Lech am Arlberg&lt;/a&gt;) at the time, Balkenende informed her formally by phone about the break-up of the cabinet. She returned soon to The Hague and held consultations with advisors and with the leaders of all political groupings in parliament on 22 and 23 February. On the latter day, the queen accepted the resignations of the PvdA ministers and secretaries, and maintained the 15 remaining cabinet members of CDA and Christian Union (whose positions had also been offered to the queen for consideration, a customary procedure in the Netherlands) to run a &lt;a href=\"demissionary%20cabinet\"&gt;demissionary cabinet&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"caretaker%20government\"&gt;caretaker government&lt;/a&gt;), which meant that it could not make large decisions or proposals on topics deemed controversial. No new cabinet members were appointed, the already functioning ministers and state secretaries taking care of the empty positions until a new government would be formed. &lt;a href=\"2010%20Dutch%20general%20election\"&gt;Early elections&lt;/a&gt; were held on 9 June 2010. The &lt;a href=\"2010%20Dutch%20cabinet%20formation\"&gt;cabinet formation&lt;/a&gt; started a day later.\nLabour leader Wouter Bos, who resigned as deputy prime minister and finance minister, announced that he wanted to continue to lead his party. Labour Party leader Bos denied that the upcoming local elections in the Netherlands played a role in the decision to refuse to compromise on a possible extension of the Dutch military mission in Afghanistan."
