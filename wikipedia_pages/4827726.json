    "text": "This is a list of the 47 cases reported in volume 25 (12 Wheat.) of \"&lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Reports\"&gt;United States Reports&lt;/a&gt;\", decided by the &lt;a href=\"Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; from January 1827 to March 1827.\nNominative report.\nIn 1874, the U.S. government created the \"United States Reports\", and retroactively numbered older privately-published &lt;a href=\"Law%20report\"&gt;case reports&lt;/a&gt; as part of the new series. As a result, cases appearing in volumes 1\u201390 of \"U.S. Reports\" have dual &lt;a href=\"Case%20citation\"&gt;citation forms&lt;/a&gt;; one for the volume number of \"U.S. Reports\", and one for the volume number of the reports named for the relevant reporter of decisions (these are called \"&lt;a href=\"Nominate%20reports\"&gt;nominative reports&lt;/a&gt;\").\nHenry Wheaton.\nStarting with the 14th volume of \"U.S. Reports\", the &lt;a href=\"Reporter%20of%20Decisions%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Henry%20Wheaton\"&gt;Henry Wheaton&lt;/a&gt;. Wheaton was Reporter of Decisions from 1816 to 1827, covering volumes 14 through 25 of \"United States Reports\" which correspond to volumes 1 through 12 of his \"Wheaton's Reports\". As such, the dual form of citation to, for example, \"Brown v. Maryland\" is 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 419 (1827).\nJustices of the Supreme Court at the time of 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.).\nThe Supreme Court is established by &lt;a href=\"Article%20Three%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution\"&gt;Article III, Section 1&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Constitution of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, which says: \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court . . .\". The size of the Court is not specified; the Constitution leaves it to &lt;a href=\"Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; to set the number of justices. Under the &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201789\"&gt;Judiciary Act of 1789&lt;/a&gt; Congress originally fixed the number of justices at six (one chief justice and five associate justices). Since 1789 Congress has varied the size of the Court from six to &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Circuit%20Act%20of%201807\"&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20and%20Ninth%20Circuits%20Act%20of%201837\"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Circuit%20Act%20of%201863\"&gt;ten&lt;/a&gt;, and back to &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201869\"&gt;nine&lt;/a&gt; justices (always including one chief justice). When the cases in 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) were decided, the Court comprised these seven justices:\nNotable Case in 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.).\n\"Ogden v. Saunders\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Ogden%20v.%20Saunders\"&gt;Ogden v. Saunders&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.courtlistener.com/opinion/85530/ogden-v-saunders\"&gt;25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 213 (1827)&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court determined the scope of a &lt;a href=\"bankruptcy%20law\"&gt;bankruptcy law&lt;/a&gt; in relation to a clause of the &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;Constitution of the United States&lt;/a&gt;. It is notable for its era in producing multiple opinions from the justices, either writing for the Court, concurring, or dissenting.\nCitation style.\nUnder the &lt;a href=\"Judiciary%20Act%20of%201789\"&gt;Judiciary Act of 1789&lt;/a&gt; the federal court structure at the time comprised District Courts, which had general trial jurisdiction; Circuit Courts, which had mixed trial and appellate (from the US District Courts) jurisdiction; and the United States Supreme Court, which had appellate jurisdiction over the federal District and Circuit courts\u2014and for certain issues over state courts. The Supreme Court also had limited &lt;a href=\"Original%20jurisdiction\"&gt;original jurisdiction&lt;/a&gt; (\"i.e.,\" in which cases could be filed directly with the Supreme Court without first having been heard by a lower federal or state court). There were one or more federal District Courts and/or Circuit Courts in each state, territory, or other geographical region.\n&lt;a href=\"Bluebook\"&gt;Bluebook&lt;/a&gt; citation style is used for case names, citations, and jurisdictions.
