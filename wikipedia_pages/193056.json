    "title": "Georges Cadoudal",
    "text": "Georges Cadoudal (; 1 January 1771 \u2013 25 June 1804), sometimes called simply Georges, was a &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; politician, and leader of the \"&lt;a href=\"Chouannerie\"&gt;Chouannerie&lt;/a&gt;\" during the &lt;a href=\"French%20Revolution\"&gt;French Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. He was posthumously named a &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20of%20France\"&gt;Marshal of France&lt;/a&gt; in 1814 by the reinstated Bourbons. Cadoudal means in Breton language \"warrior returning from the fight\".\nBiography.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Brech\"&gt;Brech&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Brittany\"&gt;Brittany&lt;/a&gt;, after completing his education, he remained true to his &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Bourbon\"&gt;Royalist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roman%20Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt; convictions during the start of the Revolution. From 1793 he organized a rebellion in the &lt;a href=\"Morbihan\"&gt;Morbihan&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"National%20Convention\"&gt;National Convention&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20French%20Republic\"&gt;First Republic&lt;/a&gt;. It was quickly suppressed, and he thereupon joined the army of the &lt;a href=\"Revolt%20in%20the%20Vend%C3%A9e\"&gt;Vend\u00e9e insurrection&lt;/a&gt;, taking part in the battles of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Le%20Mans%20%281793%29\"&gt;Le Mans&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Savenay\"&gt;Savenay&lt;/a&gt; in December of the same year.\nReturning to Morbihan, he was arrested, and imprisoned at &lt;a href=\"Brest%2C%20France\"&gt;Brest&lt;/a&gt;. He succeeded, however, in escaping, and began again the struggle against the Revolution. In spite of the defeat of his party, and of the fact that he was forced several times to take refuge in England, Cadoudal did not cease both to wage war and to conspire in favour of the Royalist pretender &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XVIII%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis, count of Provence&lt;/a&gt;. In 1799 he was a regular visitor at &lt;a href=\"Mont%20Orgueil\"&gt;Mont Orgueil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jersey\"&gt;Jersey&lt;/a&gt; where he would meet &lt;a href=\"Philippe%20d%27Auvergne\"&gt;Philippe d'Auvergne&lt;/a&gt;, a British spymaster. He refused to come to any understanding with the government, although offers were made to him by &lt;a href=\"Napoleon%20I%20of%20France\"&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte&lt;/a&gt;, who admired his skill and his obstinate energy.\nFrom 1800 it was impossible for Cadoudal to continue to wage open war, so he centered his efforts on &lt;a href=\"Conspiracy%20%28political%29\"&gt;conspiracies&lt;/a&gt;. In December, he was indirectly involved in an attempt on the life of the First Consul, led by in the &lt;a href=\"Plot%20of%20the%20Rue%20Saint-Nicaise\"&gt;Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise&lt;/a&gt;, and fled to England again.\nOn the night of 23 August 1803, landed Georges and several other &lt;a href=\"Chouan\"&gt;Chouan&lt;/a&gt;s at the foot of the cliffs of &lt;a href=\"Biville\"&gt;Biville&lt;/a&gt;. The conspirators wanted to undertake a &lt;a href=\"Pichegru%20Conspiracy\"&gt;new kidnap or assassination attempt&lt;/a&gt; on Bonaparte whilst on the road to Malmaison. Although under nominal police surveillance, he succeeded in eluding pursuit for six months, but was arrested for long periods. Found guilty and &lt;a href=\"Capital%20punishment\"&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt;, he refused to ask for &lt;a href=\"pardon\"&gt;pardon&lt;/a&gt; and was &lt;a href=\"guillotine\"&gt;guillotine&lt;/a&gt;d in Paris, along with eleven of his companions. Before being executed, he shouted to the crowd: \"And now, it's time to show to the Parisians how Christians, Royalists and Bretons die\".\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Bourbon%20Restoration%20in%20France\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, in 1814, Cadoudal was made a &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20of%20France\"&gt;Marshal of France&lt;/a&gt; posthumously, by &lt;a href=\"Louis%20XVIII%20of%20France\"&gt;Louis XVIII&lt;/a&gt;.\nCadoudal features as a main character in the 1940 &lt;a href=\"Rafael%20Sabatini\"&gt;Rafael Sabatini&lt;/a&gt; novel, \"The Marquis of Carabas\" (also known as \"Master-At-Arms\"). He is also portrayed in \"The Companions of Jehu\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Knight%20of%20Sainte-Hermine\"&gt;The Knight of Sainte-Hermine&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Alexandre%20Dumas%2C%20p%C3%A8re\"&gt;Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re&lt;/a&gt;."
