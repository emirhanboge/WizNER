    "text": "Jan Ferdynand Olszewski (; 20 August 1930 \u2013 7 February 2019) was a &lt;a href=\"Polish%20people\"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; lawyer and &lt;a href=\"politician\"&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt; who served as the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Minister%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Prime Minister of Poland&lt;/a&gt; for five months between December 1991 and early June 1992 and later became a leading figure of the &lt;a href=\"conservative\"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Movement%20for%20the%20Reconstruction%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his premiership, Olszewski's cabinet worked under new international conditions. At the end of December 1991, the &lt;a href=\"Soviet%20Union\"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; was dissolved. This motivated the government to start integration with &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"European%20Community\"&gt;European Community&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time, in official documents, it was mentioned that membership in &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; is part of Polish defence strategy. Negotiations to withdraw Russian armies from Poland started at the end of October 1990, were accelerated. In March 1992, a period of confusion occurred when president &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa\"&gt;Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa&lt;/a&gt; presented his conception of new economic and military alliance with former &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt; during his visit to Germany, which went against the euro Atlantic direction of the government. Olszewski\u2019s government changed the concept of privatization of national corporations. Total stop of privatization led to open conflict with liberal groups in the parliament. On 22 May 1992, Olszewski opposed the signing of a clause in Polish-Russian Treaty of Friendly and Neighbourly Cooperation, which handed over former Russian military bases to international Polish-Russian corporations. Olszewski sent a telegram to Moscow to the president &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa\"&gt;Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa&lt;/a&gt; informing of government opposition to the clause. Wa\u0142\u0119sa, after a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Boris%20Yeltsin\"&gt;Boris Yeltsin&lt;/a&gt; changed the controversial clause. However, this did not stop further clashes with the president.\nOlszewski's cabinet did not hold a permanent parliamentary majority. Attempts to extend the coalition, first to &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Union%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democratic%20Congress\"&gt;Liberal Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poland\"&gt;Polish Economic Programme&lt;/a&gt;, and then to &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20Independent%20Poland\"&gt;Confederation of Independent Poland&lt;/a&gt;, were unsuccessful. On 24 May 1992, the council of the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Union%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt; wrote a report calling the government to resign. On 26 May, Wa\u0142\u0119sa sent a formal note to the &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20of%20the%20Sejm\"&gt;Marshal of the Sejm&lt;/a&gt;, informing of withdrawal of support for the government. On 27 May, the four parties prepared for the &lt;a href=\"vote%20of%20no%20confidence\"&gt;vote of no confidence&lt;/a&gt; against the government. The following day, the Sejm passed a resolution obligating the Minister of Interior (at the time &lt;a href=\"Antoni%20Macierewicz\"&gt;Antoni Macierewicz&lt;/a&gt;), to publish the list of communist secret police collaborators. On 29 May, representative of the Democratic Union, &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Maria%20Rokita\"&gt;Jan Maria Rokita&lt;/a&gt;, presented a &lt;a href=\"vote%20of%20no%20confidence\"&gt;vote of no confidence&lt;/a&gt; request on the behalf of 65 members of the parliament of the 3 parties. On 2 June, the final day of coalition negotiations with the &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20Independent%20Poland\"&gt;Confederation of Independent Poland&lt;/a&gt;, Macierewicz met with deputy Marshal of that party, informing him that its leader, &lt;a href=\"Leszek%20Moczulski\"&gt;Leszek Moczulski&lt;/a&gt;, was on the list of collaborators which will be presented to the Sejm the following day.\nThe cabinet was recalled by the Sejm in voting after the midnight of 5 June 1992, few hours after publishing the list. Olszewski supported the decision of Macierewicz, proposing to establish an independent commission to verify the validity of the published documents. The Sejm did not debate this proposal. Wa\u0142\u0119sa pressured on the Sejm to speed up the vote of no confidence, sending his own request. On 5 June 1992, 00:00 AM, after a &lt;a href=\"vote%20of%20no%20confidence\"&gt;vote of no confidence&lt;/a&gt; was approved, with 273 in favour and 119 against, Olszewski was forced to resign as Prime Minister and his &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Jan%20Olszewski\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; was immediately replaced in an event known as \"the nightshift\" (\"Nocna zmiana\"). After Olszewski's dismissal, Wa\u0142\u0119sa designated Waldemar Pawlak as the new Prime Minister. Olszewski's premiership was the second shortest in the history of the &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20Poland%20%281989%E2%80%93present%29\"&gt;Third Republic&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly life and World War II.\nBorn in &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; on 20 August 1930, Olszewski originated from a working-class family employed in the railway industry who were strongly connected to the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Socialist%20Party\"&gt;Polish Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt;. Olszewski was related to &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Aleksander%20Okrzeja\"&gt;Stefan Aleksander Okrzeja&lt;/a&gt;, a Polish socialist nationalist from the turn of the 20th century who was executed by Russian authorities in 1905 for leading insurgent activities. Despite Olszewski's active preference to &lt;a href=\"right-wing%20politics\"&gt;right-wing politics&lt;/a&gt; later in life, he considered himself sympathetic to socialist causes during his early formative years.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, Olszewski was active in the &lt;a href=\"Szare%20Szeregi\"&gt;Szare Szeregi&lt;/a&gt; (Grey Ranks), an underground part of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Scouting%20Association\"&gt;Polish Scouting Association&lt;/a&gt;. According to biographical information published at footnote five, Olszewski participated in the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Uprising\"&gt;Warsaw Uprising&lt;/a&gt; in 1944. However, according to Olszewski's godson, Olszewski turned 14 years old 30 days after the Uprising began, lived in the Targ\u00f3wek district of the Praga section of Warsaw, on the East side of the Vistula River, and did not participate in the Uprising. The Uprising occurred on the West side of the Vistula River.\nPolitical career: 1954-1992.\nCommunist era: 1954-1989.\nIn the immediate post-war years, Olszewski graduated from secondary school in 1949, later going on to study law at the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Warsaw\"&gt;University of Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, where he graduated in 1953. Afterwards, he became an employee of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Justice%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Ministry of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and later worked at the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences\"&gt;Polish Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. In 1956, Olszewski joined the writing staff of the weekly \"&lt;a href=\"Po%20prostu\"&gt;Po prostu&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Plain Speaking\") magazine. As a journalist during the relatively open &lt;a href=\"Polish%20October\"&gt;Polish October&lt;/a&gt;, Olszewski came into contact with &lt;a href=\"PZPR\"&gt;PZPR&lt;/a&gt; First Secretary and \"de facto\" head of state &lt;a href=\"W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Gomu%C5%82ka\"&gt;W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka&lt;/a&gt;, whom he spent many hours interviewing and described having a trustful relationship with after many frank discussions regarding the state of affairs of &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Bloc\"&gt;Eastern Bloc&lt;/a&gt;. In an article titled \"Na spotkanie ludziom z AK\" (\"Reaching out to the Men of the Home Army\") published in March 1956, Olszewski, along with journalists Jerzy Ambroziewicz and Walery Namiotkiewicz, called for the rehabilitation of former &lt;a href=\"Armia%20Krajowa\"&gt;Armia Krajowa&lt;/a&gt; soldiers who faced persecution from communist authorities for anti-state activities.\nOne of the first openly published articles of its kind to break the official silence on the Armia Krajowa, Olszewski argued that its veterans deserved a positive historical assessment in the struggle against &lt;a href=\"Nazi%20Germany\"&gt;Nazi Germany&lt;/a&gt;, describing all subsequent prosecutions of its ranks as being politically motivated. Despite the government's initial toleration of \"Po prostu\"'s critiques, authorities moved in to forcibly close down the publication's offices in October 1956, citing it of presenting a false view of political and economic realities, spreading \"disbeliefs\" about socialism and proclaiming \"bourgeois concepts\". For his part, Olszewski faced a publication ban beginning in 1957. The forcible closure and censoring of \"Po prostu\" led Olszewski to become quickly disillusioned with the communist order. As a response, from 1956 to 1962, Olszewski was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Crooked%20Circle%20Club\"&gt;Crooked Circle Club&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;-based underground discussion group composed of intellectuals critical of the regime. During the 1960s, Olszewski became a leading defence attorney in political trials. Among others, he defended writer and journalist &lt;a href=\"Melchior%20Wa%C5%84kowicz\"&gt;Melchior Wa\u0144kowicz&lt;/a&gt;, activist &lt;a href=\"Jacek%20Kuro%C5%84\"&gt;Jacek Kuro\u0144&lt;/a&gt;, historian &lt;a href=\"Karol%20Modzelewski\"&gt;Karol Modzelewski&lt;/a&gt; and poet &lt;a href=\"Janusz%20Szpota%C5%84ski\"&gt;Janusz Szpota\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;. His professional activity was banned again in 1968 after the &lt;a href=\"1968%20Polish%20political%20crisis\"&gt;March student protests&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Olszewski returned to practice law in 1970 as &lt;a href=\"Edward%20Gierek\"&gt;Edward Gierek&lt;/a&gt; assumed power. Grateful for Olszewski's legal defence at his trial, the writer Melchior Wa\u0144kowicz kept a close relationship with Olszewski for the rest of his life, bequeathing funds to the lawyer and fellow dissident &lt;a href=\"Jan%20J%C3%B3zef%20Lipski\"&gt;Jan J\u00f3zef Lipski&lt;/a&gt; to help future defendants of political crimes shortly before his death in 1974. Olszewski later became a signatory of the &lt;a href=\"Letter%20of%2059\"&gt;Letter of 59&lt;/a&gt; in 1975, an open protest to changes to the republic's &lt;a href=\"Constitution%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;communist constitution&lt;/a&gt;. In 1984, Olszewski served as an auxiliary prosecutor representing the family of murdered pro-&lt;a href=\"Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29\"&gt;Solidarity&lt;/a&gt; priest &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20Popie%C5%82uszko\"&gt;Jerzy Popie\u0142uszko&lt;/a&gt;, whose statements during the trial of laying blame for the priest's murder on outside influences created international headlines. Joining the &lt;a href=\"Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29\"&gt;Solidarity movement&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1980s, Olszewski quickly rose to become a major figure in the opposition movement, playing a key role in drafting its founding charter. He would go on to become one of Solidarity's most active lawyers and legal experts. Olszewski, along with Solidarity leader &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa\"&gt;Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa&lt;/a&gt; and other anti-government dissidents, participated in the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Round%20Table%20Talks\"&gt;Round Table Talks&lt;/a&gt; in early 1989 with the ruling &lt;a href=\"PZPR\"&gt;PZPR&lt;/a&gt;, where he served as the opposition's legal expert. The talks successfully paved the way towards the partially free &lt;a href=\"1989%20Polish%20legislative%20election\"&gt;1989 parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-Communist era: 1989-1991.\nWith the fall of the communist regime in 1989, Olszewski was appointed as a member of the &lt;a href=\"State%20Tribunal%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;State Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; that year, a position he would hold until 1991. In 1990, Olszewski joined the conservative &lt;a href=\"Centre%20Agreement\"&gt;Centre Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, whose party membership composed primarily of Wa\u0142\u0119sa supporters in &lt;a href=\"1990%20Polish%20presidential%20election\"&gt;that year's presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. Following the resignation of Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Tadeusz%20Mazowiecki\"&gt;Tadeusz Mazowiecki&lt;/a&gt; in November 1990 after his first-round defeat in the presidential election, newly elected President Wa\u0142\u0119sa sought a new prime minister. Initially, the president turned to Olszewski to take the position, though Olszewski quickly refused the post after numerous disagreements with Wa\u0142\u0119sa over conditions the president placed on the prime minister's cabinet. Instead, Wa\u0142\u0119sa turned to &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Krzysztof%20Bielecki\"&gt;Jan Krzysztof Bielecki&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democratic%20Congress\"&gt;Liberal Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt; to form a government. Bielecki's government lasted for the rest of 1991, collapsing in the aftermath of the inconclusive &lt;a href=\"1991%20Polish%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1991 parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Wa\u0142\u0119sa appointed &lt;a href=\"Bronis%C5%82aw%20Geremek\"&gt;Bronis\u0142aw Geremek&lt;/a&gt; as prime minister, an accord was signed by five centrist and rightist parties in the &lt;a href=\"Sejm\"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democratic%20Congress\"&gt;Liberal Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Christian%20National%20Union\"&gt;Christian National Union&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Peasants%27%20Agreement\"&gt;Peasants' Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20Independent%20Poland\"&gt;Confederation for an Independent Poland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Center%20Civic%20Alliance\"&gt;Center Civic Alliance&lt;/a&gt; list (whose Olszewski's &lt;a href=\"Centre%20Agreement\"&gt;Centre Agreement&lt;/a&gt; belonged to) to select the next premier. The parties supported Olszewski, a parliamentary outsider and respected lawyer from the Solidarity movement, to unite the various clubs. Grudgingly, Wa\u0142\u0119sa, who no longer had a stable working relationship with Olszewski, honoured the coalition agreement and appointed the lawyer as premier on 6 December. Three weeks of selecting the cabinet followed. In the meantime, the original accord behind Olszewski's appointment immediately began to fall apart, as both the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democratic%20Congress\"&gt;Liberal Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20Independent%20Poland\"&gt;Confederation for an Independent Poland&lt;/a&gt; withdrew their support from Olszewski over economic and cabinet disagreements. Similarly, the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Union%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt; refused to support an administration not committed to rapid economic reform, a concern shared with the Liberal Democrats. Despite the weakened alliance, Olszewski's &lt;a href=\"minority%20government\"&gt;minority government&lt;/a&gt; was accepted by parliament on 23 December 1991.\nPrime Minister: 1991-1992.\nForeign and domestic policy.\nFollowing the oath of office, Olszewski's government faced difficulties on many fronts. Previously, Olszewski had placed deep criticism on Finance Minister &lt;a href=\"Leszek%20Balcerowicz\"&gt;Leszek Balcerowicz&lt;/a&gt; from the previous two administrations and his controversial &lt;a href=\"Balcerowicz%20Plan\"&gt;Balcerowicz Plan&lt;/a&gt;, vigorously opposing the minister's &lt;a href=\"shock%20therapy%20%28economics%29\"&gt;shock therapy&lt;/a&gt; program. Removing Balcerowicz from the cabinet, Olszewski selected Karol Lutowski, a known critic of shock therapy, as his replacement. With unemployment rising to 11.4 percent and the nation's gross domestic product declining by ten percent over the course of one year, the Olszewski government faced pressure to amend the unpopular economic plan. Despite his professed &lt;a href=\"monetarism\"&gt;monetarist&lt;/a&gt; beliefs, Olszewski pushed for a package of reforms to loosen &lt;a href=\"Credit%20%28finance%29\"&gt;credit&lt;/a&gt;, ease earlier anti-inflation policies, reintroduce &lt;a href=\"price%20support\"&gt;price support&lt;/a&gt;s for a number of agricultural products, and release more subsidies to the state sector of the &lt;a href=\"economy%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Polish economy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIncluded in his industrial interventionist policy, the premier also proposed the unification of the nation's economic ministries to coordinate ongoing privatizations, as well as for all industrial and trade policies. When put to a vote, however, the deeply fragmented &lt;a href=\"Sejm\"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt; rejected Olszewski's reform packages, due to objections that the proposals were overly domineering or were too weak. Over the course of his government, the Sejm proved to be a barrier to any strong reforms. Olszewski explained his views on economic reforms in an interview with Anthony Murawski in the summer of 1992, published in September 1992 in Multinational Monitor magazine (founded by Ralph Nader). In particular, the prime minister's plans to reverse the &lt;a href=\"Balcerowicz%20Plan\"&gt;Balcerowicz Plan&lt;/a&gt; proved impossible due to his fragile &lt;a href=\"minority%20government\"&gt;minority government&lt;/a&gt;. Without majority support, Olszewski relied on the conditional support of &lt;a href=\"Tadeusz%20Mazowiecki\"&gt;Mazowiecki's&lt;/a&gt; Democratic Union and &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Krzysztof%20Bielecki\"&gt;Bielecki's&lt;/a&gt; Liberal Democratic Congress, yet both men and their respective parties insisted on prioritizing economic reforms. Within the government itself, the relationship between the seven parties composing the coalition was fragile at best, teetering on collapse by March 1992. Under pressure from the president to expand the coalition, Olszewski turned to the Democratic Union and the &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20Independent%20Poland\"&gt;Confederation for an Independent Poland&lt;/a&gt;, though the Union insisted on a conservative budget before it could join the &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Poland\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs with the two previous administrations, the Olszewski government's foreign policy continued to steer towards the &lt;a href=\"Western%20bloc\"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt;, with the stated desire of joining &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;. The prime minister's selection of &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Parys\"&gt;Jan Parys&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Defence%20of%20Poland\"&gt;defense minister&lt;/a&gt; indicated a policy hostile to &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; while Foreign Minister &lt;a href=\"Krzysztof%20Skubiszewski\"&gt;Krzysztof Skubiszewski&lt;/a&gt;, a veteran of the previous &lt;a href=\"Tadeusz%20Mazowiecki\"&gt;Mazowiecki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jan%20Krzysztof%20Bielecki\"&gt;Bielecki&lt;/a&gt; governments, pursued efforts of moderation and compromise, balancing relations between the West and Moscow. President Wa\u0142\u0119sa, however, sharply disagreed with the prime minister, arguing that foreign policy efforts instead should drive towards building an alternative military alliance with fellow ex-&lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Pact\"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt; states. Wa\u0142\u0119sa's proposals coincided with his own security uncertainties over the recent violent &lt;a href=\"Yugoslav%20Wars\"&gt;collapse of Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union\"&gt;dissolution of the Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;, and from a fear that joining NATO would put Poland in an opposing position to Russia. In response, Olszewski accused Skubiszewski, and by extension Wa\u0142\u0119sa, who both advocated cooperation with &lt;a href=\"Russia\"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; in regards to troop withdrawals, of \"&lt;a href=\"Finlandization\"&gt;Finlandizing&lt;/a&gt;\" foreign policy.\nIndividuals close to the Olszewski government, like &lt;a href=\"Jaros%C5%82aw%20Kaczy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, referred to Wa\u0142\u0119sa's &lt;a href=\"Belweder\"&gt;Belweder&lt;/a&gt; residence as a den of Russian interests, which was determined to \"maintain and protect the communist set-up\" and control Russian influence in Polish internal affairs. Additionally, both men stood at odds over &lt;a href=\"Poland%E2%80%93Ukraine%20relations\"&gt;Polish-Ukrainian relations&lt;/a&gt;, with Olszewski arguing that the relationship with &lt;a href=\"Government%20of%20Ukraine\"&gt;Kyiv&lt;/a&gt; needed equal footing with &lt;a href=\"Poland-Russia%20relations\"&gt;Polish-Russian relations&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, relations with the West financially soured under Olszewski's tenureship. In the face of the premier's attempts to stimulate the economy by proposing to raise the budget deficit, the &lt;a href=\"International%20Monetary%20Fund\"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; demanded instead a restrictive budget in order to resume lending. Particularly, Western donor states pressured Olszewski to replace Lutowski as finance minister. When Olszewski reshuffled ministers, placing &lt;a href=\"Andrzej%20Olechowski\"&gt;Andrzej Olechowski&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Finance%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Ministry of Finance&lt;/a&gt;, observers believed that the premier had reverted to a hard-line economic reform posture. Yet when the &lt;a href=\"Sejm\"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt; passed a bill authorizing salary and pension increases, raising the budget deficit by fifty percent, Olechowski fiercely objected and resigned from the cabinet, claiming he did not have \"the slightest idea\" of how to explain the government's economic reasoning to the IMF.\nDe-communization and the Parys affair.\nThe conflict between Olszewski and Wa\u0142\u0119sa continued to escalate throughout 1992, culminating in a major political crisis by that summer. As premier, Olszewski portrayed himself and his government as staunchly anti-communist, arguing that in the year 1992, Poland continued to remain a communist country. Claiming that communist agents remained in all corridors of economic and political power, Olszewski argued for a purge, particularly of those in the economic sector, whom Olszewski believed were holding back Poland's new capitalist free market and kept workers bound. \"The invisible hand [of the market]\", Olszewski said, was \"simply the hand of the swindler plundering funds from the state treasury\". As such, Olszewski argued for increased democratization and de-communinization at all levels of Polish society. Olszewski's drive towards de-communization was also reflected in his cabinet. Jan Parys, Olszewski's defense minister, actively pursued efforts to de-communize the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Armed%20Forces\"&gt;Polish Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; and establish civilian ministerial control. These plans ran in conjunction with Wa\u0142\u0119sa's efforts to stake executive control over the defense establishment. Parys and Wa\u0142\u0119sa repeatedly clashed over plans to reorganize national security commands, with Parys effectively challenging Wa\u0142\u0119sa's role as commander in chief by claiming ministerial rights over the armed forces.\nThe clash between both men came to a head in April 1992, when, upon learning of a meeting between &lt;a href=\"National%20Security%20Bureau%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;National Security Bureau&lt;/a&gt; Director Jerzy Milewski, a close Wa\u0142\u0119sa ally, with &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Army\"&gt;Polish Army&lt;/a&gt; General Tadeusz Wilecki, promising the general's promotion to the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20General%20Staff\"&gt;high command&lt;/a&gt;, Parys accused the presidency of interfering with the defense ministry's portfolio. Parys stated that \"certain politicians\" promised promotions to army officers in exchange \"for a kind of army support for political maneuvers\". Parys further elaborated that \"politicians who undertake such moves behind my back are simply involved in intrigue\", believing that \"they are working to the detriment of the army and Poland; they simply are political schemers. To put it briefly: the Polish Army will help no one striving to abolish democracy in Poland\". Parys's implication of a possible &lt;a href=\"coup%20d%27etat\"&gt;coup d'etat&lt;/a&gt; on the behalf of Wa\u0142\u0119sa and his allies with bribed high-ranking military officials rocked the entire Polish political establishment. To quiet the political storm, Olszewski responded by placing Parys on administrative leave. In response, a parliamentary commission was quickly created in the &lt;a href=\"Sejm\"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt; to investigate Parys's claims. The commission's findings cleared Wa\u0142\u0119sa of wrongdoing and declared Parys's claims as baseless and \"unfounded\", forcing the defense minister to resign. In the aftermath of the Parys affair, Wa\u0142\u0119sa bitterly complained of the Olszewski government's handling of the controversy, declaring the government's civilian leaders of endangering both national security and the professionalism of the military. The relationship between Olszewski and Wa\u0142\u0119sa further soured with Olszewski's appointment of &lt;a href=\"Rados%C5%82aw%20Sikorski\"&gt;Rados\u0142aw Sikorski&lt;/a&gt; as deputy defense minister without presidential consultation, a move interpreted as the premier vying for influence within the armed forces.\nClashes with Wa\u0142\u0119sa.\nThe deepening chasm between both men began to interrupt foreign policy. As both men sought to assert control over the economy, the military, and international relations, particularly over-sensitive negotiations to withdraw &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Army\"&gt;Russian Army&lt;/a&gt; units from the country, Foreign Minister &lt;a href=\"Krzysztof%20Skubiszewski\"&gt;Krzysztof Skubiszewski&lt;/a&gt; admitted that by May 1992, \"[i]t was difficult to conduct the foreign policy of an internally unstable country\". The overlying reason for the clash between both men emanated from the fact that both the prime minister and the president believed their respective offices carried the prerogative to direct government policy, particularly in the defence, interior, and foreign ministries. As premier, Olszewski believed that his position, along with the collective &lt;a href=\"Cabinet%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Council of Ministers&lt;/a&gt;, held precedence in conducting the affairs of state. On the other side, President Wa\u0142\u0119sa believed that as the chief executive and head of state he was ultimately responsible for the direction of the republic's affairs. The clash between both offices created a highly charged and disruptive political environment. Despite this instability, Skubiszewski continued to negotiate with his Russian counterparts on financial and business settlements in regards to the pullout of &lt;a href=\"Russian%20Army\"&gt;Russian Army&lt;/a&gt; units from the country. Skubiszewski's diplomatic efforts to reach a compromise with his Russian colleagues were met with vehement criticism from Olszewski, with many close to the premier believing that any monetary or trade settlements constituted a renewed occupation. Despite the premier's strong objections to the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Foreign Ministry&lt;/a&gt;'s negotiations with their Russian counterparts, President Wa\u0142\u0119sa strongly supported such moves for a final agreement. Meetings between Olszewski and Wa\u0142\u0119sa in May 1992 displayed the divide between both men, with the premier insisting on removing any article on joint Polish-Russian financial and business deals from the treaty while Wa\u0142\u0119sa responded that he intended to visit Russia not \"to negotiate any agreement, but to sign it\".\nDismissal.\nBy late May, Olszewski's fragile coalition faced collapse. Shortly after returning from &lt;a href=\"Moscow\"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; from signing the cooperation treaty on 26 May 1992, Wa\u0142\u0119sa formally asked the &lt;a href=\"Sejm\"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt; to withdraw its support from Olszewski's premiership, stating he had no faith in the government. The president cited the government's \"irresponsible steps in foreign affairs\" as part of his decision. Two days later on 28 May, with half of parliament's members absent, Sejm member &lt;a href=\"Janusz%20Korwin-Mikke\"&gt;Janusz Korwin-Mikke&lt;/a&gt; of the small conservative-libertarian &lt;a href=\"Real%20Politics%20Union\"&gt;Real Politics Union&lt;/a&gt; successfully pressed for and passed a motion requiring the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Interior%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Ministry of Interior&lt;/a&gt; to identify all of the republic's leading politicians who collaborated previously in the communist secret services. Despite the resolution, opposition parties, including the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Union%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democratic%20Congress\"&gt;Liberal Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt; and the Polish Economic Program (a split faction of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Beer-Lovers%27%20Party\"&gt;Polish Beer-Lovers' Party&lt;/a&gt;), moved to file a &lt;a href=\"vote%20of%20no%20confidence\"&gt;vote of no confidence&lt;/a&gt;. Responding to the &lt;a href=\"lustration%20in%20Poland\"&gt;lustration&lt;/a&gt; resolution six days later on 4 June, Interior Minister &lt;a href=\"Antoni%20Macierewicz\"&gt;Antoni Macierewicz&lt;/a&gt; released to all parliamentary faction heads a secret list of 64 names of communist-era collaborators drawn from his ministry's archives. Known as the Macierewicz List, which was quickly leaked to the public, the roster included &lt;a href=\"Wies%C5%82aw%20Chrzanowski\"&gt;Wies\u0142aw Chrzanowski&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20of%20the%20Sejm\"&gt;Marshal of the Sejm&lt;/a&gt; and a member of Olszewski's coalition as well as &lt;a href=\"Leszek%20Moczulski\"&gt;Leszek Moczulski&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the opposition &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20Independent%20Poland\"&gt;Confederation for an Independent Poland&lt;/a&gt;. A second list published shortly afterwards included President Wa\u0142\u0119sa himself. In response, Wa\u0142\u0119sa immediately demanded for the government's dismissal, yet in private, the president confessed to opposition legislators his worries that Olszewski was orchestrating a last minute &lt;a href=\"coup\"&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt; against him. Late on the night of 4 June, on the eve of his vote of confidence, Olszewski made an unplanned televised address on public broadcasters &lt;a href=\"TVP1\"&gt;TVP1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"TVP2\"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, defending his administration's &lt;a href=\"lustration\"&gt;lustration&lt;/a&gt; list and appealing for the public to rally behind the government: My government was the first to want to reveal old, secret relationships of individuals who recently volunteered to enter into the state's new administration. I believe that the Polish people should know those who govern them, including those who helped the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;UB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"S%C5%82u%C5%BCba%20Bezpiecze%C5%84stwa\"&gt;SB&lt;/a&gt; to keep Poles enslaved. I believe the collaborators of the former communist political police constitute a threat to the security of the free Polish people. The people should know that not coincidentally, just at the moment when we can finally break away from communist ties, there is a sudden move for the government's dismissal.\nIn the early hours after midnight on 5 June, in an event known as the \"nocna zmiana\" (\"the nightshift\"), the &lt;a href=\"Sejm\"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt; convened for a &lt;a href=\"vote%20of%20no%20confidence\"&gt;vote of no confidence&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Olszewski's public appeals both on television and within the debating chamber, parliament's majority opinion became readily apparent of supporting his dismissal. Aside from the opposition post-communist &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Left%20Alliance\"&gt;Democratic Left Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href=\"Tadeusz%20Mazowiecki\"&gt;Mazowiecki&lt;/a&gt;-oriented &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Union%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;Democratic Union&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Liberal%20Democratic%20Congress\"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, and other centrist and liberal parties remained unfazed with their loss of confidence with the prime minister. The opposition was joined from the right by the &lt;a href=\"Confederation%20of%20Independent%20Poland\"&gt;Confederation for an Independent Poland&lt;/a&gt;, whose members derided the Olszewski government's attempt at radical lustration just before a vote of confidence as outright &lt;a href=\"blackmail\"&gt;blackmail&lt;/a&gt;. Facing certain defeat, an emotional Olszewski addressed the Sejm, stating: I would like to get out of this place with just one achievement. And as of this moment, I have the belief that I will go out with it. I would like to say when this period finishes when time runs out for me\u2014I admit\u2014a terribly painful time, when in my hometown's streets, I can only move about by car or in the company of guards protecting me from human contact\u2014when my time does finally finish\u2014I can take to the streets of my city freely again, to move about and look people in the eye. And that for you, honourable members is what I wish for after this vote.\nThe vote of no confidence was approved, with 273 in favour and 119 against. Olszewski was immediately replaced by Wa\u0142\u0119sa ally &lt;a href=\"Waldemar%20Pawlak\"&gt;Waldemar Pawlak&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20People%27s%20Party\"&gt;Polish People's Party&lt;/a&gt;. Pawlak's government failed to gain support from &lt;a href=\"Sejm\"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt; majority and failed in a vote of confidence. Pawlak later resigned and Wa\u0142\u0119sa replaced him by &lt;a href=\"Hanna%20Suchocka\"&gt;Hanna Suchocka&lt;/a&gt;, who won support from the majority. Two weeks following the government's no-confidence vote, the &lt;a href=\"Constitutional%20Tribunal%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Constitutional Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; ruled 11\u20131 the Sejm's 28 May lustration resolution singling out alleged communist collaborators as illegal due to it not being a statutory enactment, as well as violating both the dignity of citizens and democratic values. The list produced by former Interior Minister Macierewicz was similarly found to be filled with inaccuracies, forcing the ministry to later apologize to several of those falsely implicated.\nPost-Premiership.\nParliamentary career: 1992-2005.\nFollowing his dismissal, Olszewski resumed his career as a member of the Sejm. Olszewski departed from the &lt;a href=\"Centre%20Agreement\"&gt;Centre Agreement&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of 1992 with a number of other rebel MPs, creating the Movement for the Republic. The new party was joined by other anti-Wa\u0142\u0119sa and former Solidarity supporters, carrying a quasi-nationalist and ultra-Catholic platform. As a parliamentarian, Olszewski led his club's opposition to the &lt;a href=\"Small%20Constitution%20of%201992\"&gt;Small Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, believing it did not offer a clear break from the Stalinist constitution of 1956. Olszewski led his party to support the &lt;a href=\"vote%20of%20no%20confidence\"&gt;vote of no confidence&lt;/a&gt; against Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Hanna%20Suchocka\"&gt;Hanna Suchocka&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, believing her economic policies had harmed the state. In the subsequent &lt;a href=\"1993%20Polish%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;elections that year&lt;/a&gt;, Olszewski lost his seat as the electorate swung to the &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Left%20Alliance\"&gt;Democratic Left Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Aleksander%20Kwa%C5%9Bniewski\"&gt;Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski&lt;/a&gt;), despite a failed attempt to reunite rightist forces with the &lt;a href=\"Centre%20Agreement\"&gt;Centre Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, now headed by &lt;a href=\"Jaros%C5%82aw%20Kaczy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1995, Olszewski launched a bid for the presidency in &lt;a href=\"1995%20Polish%20presidential%20election\"&gt;that year's presidential election&lt;/a&gt; in order to replace his rival Wa\u0142\u0119sa. Campaigning on an anti-communist and patriotic platform, Olszewski garnered 1,225,453 votes, with nearly seven percent of the vote and earned fourth place. However, both he and Wa\u0142\u0119sa lost to winning left-wing candidate &lt;a href=\"Aleksander%20Kwa%C5%9Bniewski\"&gt;Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Social%20Democracy%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Social Democracy&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the same year, in an attempt to consolidate the former premier's relatively strong performance in the presidential ballot, Olszewski and his supporters established the &lt;a href=\"Movement%20for%20Reconstruction%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the new party banner, poll numbers initially gave Olszewski's block a sixteen percent approval rating by the middle of 1996, yet this period was cut short with the creation of &lt;a href=\"Solidarity%20Electoral%20Action\"&gt;Solidarity Electoral Action&lt;/a&gt;, a rival conservative alliance led by &lt;a href=\"Marian%20Krzaklewski\"&gt;Marian Krzaklewski&lt;/a&gt;. The results of the &lt;a href=\"1997%20Polish%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;1997 parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt; garnered Olszewski's party with 5.6 percent of the vote, returning the former premier to the &lt;a href=\"Sejm\"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt; with 6 seats. During this period, Olszewski supported Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Jerzy%20Buzek\"&gt;Jerzy Buzek&lt;/a&gt;'s 1997 concordant with the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20See\"&gt;Holy See&lt;/a&gt;, reasoning that the &lt;a href=\"Catholic%20Church\"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; was \"one of the most important, if not the most important, and certainly the most durable, longest-running and most rooted institution in Polish national life and culture\". At the same time, Olszewski also generally supported European integration and the government's efforts for Poland's accession into the &lt;a href=\"European%20Union\"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, though stressed reservations on the economic conditions of integration, particularly insisting that the national banking sector must remain within domestic hands. However, the Movement became increasingly marginalized due to numerous party splits.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2000%20Polish%20presidential%20election\"&gt;2000 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, Olszewski stood again as a candidate, but withdrew from the race shortly before the vote and later supported the &lt;a href=\"Solidarity%20Electoral%20Action\"&gt;Solidarity Electoral Action&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href=\"Marian%20Krzaklewski\"&gt;Marian Krzaklewski&lt;/a&gt;. Olszewski was reelected to the Sejm in &lt;a href=\"2001%20Polish%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt;, with his party allied with the populist far-right &lt;a href=\"League%20of%20Polish%20Families\"&gt;League of Polish Families&lt;/a&gt;. However, Olszewski broke with the League shortly after his reelection over policy differences. Prior to Poland's admission into the EU in 2004, Olszewski expressed worry that Poland's &lt;a href=\"2004%20enlargement%20of%20the%20European%20Union\"&gt;accession to the European Union&lt;/a&gt; would pave the way for Germans to make property claims regarding land seized during the &lt;a href=\"Flight%20and%20expulsion%20of%20Germans%20from%20Poland%20during%20and%20after%20World%20War%20II\"&gt;population expulsions&lt;/a&gt; at the end of &lt;a href=\"World%20War%20II\"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;. The former premier also expressed in 2005 his support for strong security and political relations with the &lt;a href=\"United%20States\"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; within a transatlantic framework, though expressed reservations to stronger ties with &lt;a href=\"Germany\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; until property claims were dealt with.\nIn 2005, Olszewski, along with his former cabinet ministers &lt;a href=\"Antoni%20Macierewicz\"&gt;Antoni Macierewicz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Janowski\"&gt;Gabriel Janowski&lt;/a&gt;, created the Patriotic Movement, a right-wing nationalist political block combining the forces of his own party with those of the &lt;a href=\"National-Catholic%20Movement\"&gt;National-Catholic Movement&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Polish%20Alliance\"&gt;Polish Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, where he became the head of the new organization. In that year's &lt;a href=\"2005%20Polish%20parliamentary%20election\"&gt;parliamentary election&lt;/a&gt;, Olszewski ran for a &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Poland\"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; seat in the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; constituency for the &lt;a href=\"Law%20and%20Justice\"&gt;Law and Justice&lt;/a&gt; list, but was defeated, coming sixth. Following his exit from parliament after his failed Senat bid, Olszewski was appointed as deputy chairman of the &lt;a href=\"State%20Tribunal%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;State Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; between 2005 and 2006. President &lt;a href=\"Lech%20Kaczy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Lech Kaczy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt; later appointed Olszewski as a presidential adviser in April 2006, a position he held until Kaczy\u0144ski's death in the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Polish%20Air%20Force%20Tu-154%20crash\"&gt;2010 Smolensk air disaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonal life and death.\nOlszewski was married to Marta Olszewska, a former activist, editor and journalist of \"&lt;a href=\"Tygodnik%20Solidarno%C5%9B%C4%87\"&gt;Tygodnik Solidarno\u015b\u0107&lt;/a&gt;\". On the night of 16 August 2000, Olszewski was involved in a deadly car crash on &lt;a href=\"National%20road%208%20%28Poland%29\"&gt;national road 8&lt;/a&gt; near the village of &lt;a href=\"Mark%C3%B3w-Towarzystwo\"&gt;Mark\u00f3w-Towarzystwo&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Masovian%20Voivodeship\"&gt;Masovian Voivodeship&lt;/a&gt;, when the car Olszewski was a passenger in collided with a truck. The driver of the car (Olszewski's party treasurer) was killed in the crash, while Olszewski escaped with only minor injuries. In July 2014, Olszewski was made an honorary citizen of &lt;a href=\"Warsaw\"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; by Mayor &lt;a href=\"Hanna%20Gronkiewicz-Waltz\"&gt;Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz&lt;/a&gt; for his participation in the &lt;a href=\"Warsaw%20Uprising\"&gt;Warsaw Uprising&lt;/a&gt; as well as citing his moral and social authority in service of the city. Olszewski died after a long illness on 7 February 2019 in a Warsaw hospital.\nLegacy.\nOlszewski remains a controversial figure within Polish politics. Members of the right-wing, particularly &lt;a href=\"Law%20and%20Justice\"&gt;Law and Justice&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Jaros%C5%82aw%20Kaczy%C5%84ski\"&gt;Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski&lt;/a&gt;, have praised the former premier for his anti-communist stances and legal principles. On the twentieth anniversary of the Olszewski government's vote of no confidence in 2012, Kaczy\u0144ski praised Olszewski for attempting to stop the rapid privatizations of the early 1990s, and having helped steer Poland towards its eventual integration into &lt;a href=\"NATO\"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;. Former Interior Minister &lt;a href=\"Antoni%20Macierewicz\"&gt;Antoni Macierewicz&lt;/a&gt; also affirmed his personal belief in 2012 that had the Olszewski government not fallen, \"the &lt;a href=\"2010%20Polish%20Air%20Force%20Tu-154%20crash\"&gt;Smolensk disaster&lt;/a&gt; would never have transpired\".\nPoliticians on the centre-right have viewed Olszewski more critically. &lt;a href=\"Christian%20National%20Union\"&gt;Christian National Union&lt;/a&gt; politician &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Niesio%C5%82owski\"&gt;Stefan Niesio\u0142owski&lt;/a&gt; strongly defended Olszewski during his vote of no confidence in 1992, declaring to the premier's detractors that \"you're making a political mistake and Poland won't forget this error\". In an interview in 2007, Niesio\u0142owski (now a &lt;a href=\"Civic%20Platform\"&gt;Civic Platform&lt;/a&gt; parliamentarian) regretted his defense of the former prime minister in hindsight, describing Olszewski as \"being a poor man who supported a moral lie\" with the Macierewicz List, \"and was still silent\". Prime Minister &lt;a href=\"Donald%20Tusk\"&gt;Donald Tusk&lt;/a&gt; similarly accused Olszewski of misleading information in 2008 during a non-governmental investigation into communist era archives conducted by the former premier, declaring: \"I know that in Poland there are politicians who have genuinely strange archives and cannot get used to the idea that they're no longer prime ministers or heads of committees anymore, spending instead a lifetime in these archives, poisoning our public space with their own interpretations of what they have found\". In an opinion poll conducted by &lt;a href=\"CBOS\"&gt;CBOS&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, asking respondents to evaluate who was the best prime minister of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Polish%20Republic\"&gt;Third Republic&lt;/a&gt;, Olszewski was placed at seventh place. A similar poll conducted by Millward Brown later that year positioned Olszewski at sixth place."
