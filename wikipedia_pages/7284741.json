A &lt;a href=\"Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;, Moffett served in the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives\"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; as the member from &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%27s%206th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;Connecticut's 6th congressional district&lt;/a&gt; from 1975 to 1983. Moffett is currently Senior Advisor at &lt;a href=\"Mayer%20Brown%20LLP\"&gt;Mayer Brown LLP&lt;/a&gt;. \nEarly life and education.\nMoffett was born in &lt;a href=\"Holyoke%2C%20Massachusetts\"&gt;Holyoke, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Lebanon\"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; immigrants. He attended Suffield Elementary School in Suffield, Connecticut and graduated from &lt;a href=\"Suffield%20High%20School\"&gt;Suffield High School&lt;/a&gt;. He received his &lt;a href=\"Bachelor%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Bachelor of Arts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Academic%20degree\"&gt;degree&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Syracuse%20University\"&gt;Syracuse University&lt;/a&gt; in 1966 and studied in &lt;a href=\"Florence\"&gt;Florence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Italy\"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; from 1963 to 1964. He received his &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Arts\"&gt;Master of Arts&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Boston%20College\"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt; in 1968.\nPolitical career.\nAn avid Democrat and leading voice on environmental issues, Moffett first appeared on the national scene in the 1970s as an environmental activist and coalition-builder in his home state of Connecticut.\nMoffett served as Director of the Office of Students and Youth in the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Education\"&gt;Office of Education&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Department%20of%20Health%2C%20Education%2C%20and%20Welfare\"&gt;Department of Health, Education, and Welfare&lt;/a&gt; from 1969 to 1970, but quit to &lt;a href=\"Opposition%20to%20the%20Vietnam%20War\"&gt;protest the Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;. On April 10, 1975, Moffet walked out of the House chamber during President Ford's State of the World speech when he requested military aid for Vietnam. \nAligned with consumer activist &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Nader\"&gt;Ralph Nader&lt;/a&gt;, Moffett founded the &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%20Citizen%20Action%20Group\"&gt;Connecticut Citizen Action Group&lt;/a&gt; and parlayed this to a victory in 1974 for the seat vacated in the U.S. House of Representatives for Connecticut's 6th congressional district seat when &lt;a href=\"Ella%20T.%20Grasso\"&gt;Ella T. Grasso&lt;/a&gt; ran for &lt;a href=\"Governor%20of%20Connecticut\"&gt;governor&lt;/a&gt;. Moffett held the northwestern Connecticut seat until 1982. He was regarded as a &lt;a href=\"Liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States\"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; and an opponent of the &lt;a href=\"oil%20industry\"&gt;oil industry&lt;/a&gt;. He was also closely aligned with &lt;a href=\"trade%20union\"&gt;trade union&lt;/a&gt;s. Moffett served as chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy, Environment, and Natural Resources.\nIn 1981, he was selected to be one of the first \"Young Leaders\" of the &lt;a href=\"French-American%20Foundation\"&gt;French-American Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1982 Moffett challenged &lt;a href=\"United%20States%20Senate\"&gt;U.S. Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lowell%20Weicker\"&gt;Lowell Weicker&lt;/a&gt;. While 1982 was a strong year for Democrats nationwide, Weicker was considered a &lt;a href=\"Rockefeller%20Republican\"&gt;moderate/liberal Republican&lt;/a&gt; and defeated Moffett 52-46 percent. Moffett's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, liberal &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%20Senate\"&gt;State Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bill%20Curry%20%28politician%29\"&gt;Bill Curry&lt;/a&gt; also lost the 6th district seat to &lt;a href=\"Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29\"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nancy%20Johnson\"&gt;Nancy Johnson&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoffett attempted a political comeback in 1986 seeking to gain the Democratic nomination over incumbent Governor &lt;a href=\"William%20O%27Neill%20%28Connecticut%20politician%29\"&gt;William O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;. That effort failed. Moffett later was a broadcaster on &lt;a href=\"WVIT\"&gt;WVIT&lt;/a&gt; Channel 30 in &lt;a href=\"Hartford\"&gt;Hartford&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoffett's final comeback effort was in 1990 when he moved to the town of &lt;a href=\"Newtown%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Newtown&lt;/a&gt; to seek election to the open congressional seat in &lt;a href=\"Connecticut%27s%205th%20congressional%20district\"&gt;Connecticut's 5th congressional district&lt;/a&gt;, which was being vacated by &lt;a href=\"John%20G.%20Rowland\"&gt;John G. Rowland&lt;/a&gt;, who was running for governor. Moffett's opponent, &lt;a href=\"Waterbury%2C%20Connecticut\"&gt;Waterbury&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"alderman\"&gt;alderman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gary%20Franks\"&gt;Gary Franks&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Moffett was far too liberal to represent conservative 5th district voters, and Franks won the election.\nIn 2004 he broke with Ralph Nader regarding his &lt;a href=\"Ralph%20Nader%27s%20presidential%20campaigns\"&gt;independent candidacy for president&lt;/a&gt;. Moffett was among those who coordinated a national effort on behalf of the Democrats to deny votes and &lt;a href=\"ballot%20access\"&gt;ballot access&lt;/a&gt; to the Nader campaign. He also recently criticized the independent campaign of &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Lieberman\"&gt;Joe Lieberman&lt;/a&gt;.\nSubsequent career.\nAfter serving in Congress, Moffett worked as a news anchor, producer and investigative journalist, and spent nearly a decade as a syndicated statewide columnist. In 1999, Moffett was nominated by President Clinton to be U.S. Ambassador to Argentina (although he had unanimous Senate backing, he ultimately did not become ambassador because the process had taken almost a year). \nMoffett worked at Monsanto as an international lobbyist from 1998-2000.\nMoffett is now a Washington consultant, and Chairman of The Moffett Group, representing for-profit and nonprofit entities, including large renewable energy developers and several foreign governments. In 2007, he joined with former Louisiana Congressman &lt;a href=\"Bob%20Livingston\"&gt;Bob Livingston&lt;/a&gt; and well-known consultant &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Podesta\"&gt;Tony Podesta&lt;/a&gt; to form the PLM Group, which represented the government of Egypt for 4 years.\nIn 2014, Moffett joined the law firm of &lt;a href=\"Mayer%20Brown\"&gt;Mayer Brown&lt;/a&gt; as a consultant.\nIn 2020, Moffett joined &lt;a href=\"Washington%2C%20D.C.\"&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; lobbying firm Mercury Public Affairs as co-chairman. In June 2021, it was reported that Moffett registered as a &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Agents%20Registration%20Act\"&gt;foreign agent&lt;/a&gt; lobbying on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Hikvision\"&gt;Hikvision&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese state-owned video surveillance manufacturer."
